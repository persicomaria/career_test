AphA is a magnesium-dependent, bacterial class B acid phosphatase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a variety of phosphoester substrates and belongs to the DDDD superfamily of phosphohydrolases. The recently reported crystal structure of AphA from Escherichia coli has revealed the quaternary structure of the enzyme together with hints about its catalytic mechanism. The present work reports the crystal structures of AphA from E. coli in complex with substrate, transition-state, and intermediate analogues. The structures provide new insights into the mechanism of the enzyme and allow a revision of some aspects of the previously proposed mechanism that have broader implications for all the phosphatases of the DDDD superfamily.

Introduction
Bacterial class B acid phosphatases (CBAPs) are a group of homotetrameric enzymes, consisting of 25kDa subunits, which are present in a minority of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, most of which are, however, major pathogens.1­3 CBAPs catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate groups from a variety of organic phosphoester substrates such as nucleotides and sugar phosphates4,5 and belong to the molecular superfamily of phosphohydrolases indicated as "DDDD" due to the presence of four invariant aspartate residues.6 The DDDD superfamily includes bacterial phosphoglycolate phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.18); the histidinol-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.15); domains of the

The use of chemical compounds that mimic the different steps along the reaction has become a standard powerful tool to investigate the mechanism of enzyme-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer.11 Compounds such as AlF3 and BeF2 have been used to mimic the transition state and the intermediate/product complexes of the phosphate transfer reaction.12­17 In order to validate the AphA catalytic mechanism proposed by us9 and to complete the crystallogra-

The Catalytic Mechanism of the Mg-Phosphatase AphA

479 The native AphA tetramer has a point symmetry 222 and contains four catalytic sites where the essential magnesium ions are bound. In the native enzyme, the Mg(II) ion is coordinated by the carboxylate group of Asp44 and Asp167, the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of Asp46, and three water molecules.8 Differently from the native AphA crystal structure that belongs to the orthorhombic space group I222,7,8 all the crystals of AphA complexes with products or inhibitors determined so far8,9 belong to the monoclinic space group C2 where the two enzyme molecules present in the cell lie in a special position of point symmetry 2, with the asymmetric unit containing half of the homotetrameric holoenzyme8,9 (Fig. 1a). This reflects the changed conformation of a small loop (loop 6) in two subunits (Fig. 1b).9 Least-squares superposition of AphA­PMEA, AphA­Al, and AphA­Be complexes with the native enzyme shows that loop 6 (Ala143-Thr151) can adopt two different conformations in two of the four subunits. In one instance, the loop is open towards the solvent, while in the other subunit, loop 6 is bent over towards the active site (closed conformation; Fig. 1a and b). Figure 1b shows, as an example, the two conformations found in the AphA­PMEA complex that do not seem to depend on the presence of the ligand bound into the active site as one PMEA molecule is bound in both subunits (the same occurs in the AphA­Al and AphA­Be structures). However, the closed conformation of loop 6 has been observed so far only when analogues of the substrate, intermediate, or transition state or the pro-

phic determination of all significant steps along the reaction coordinate of the nucleotide monophosphate hydrolysis catalyzed by AphA, we have undertaken the crystal structure determination of the complexes between AphA and the substrate analogue 9-[(R)-2-(phosphono-methoxy)ethyl]adenine (PMEA)18 and of the complexes of AphA with AlF3 and BeF2, which might mime, respectively, the five-coordinate transition state and the tetrahedral intermediate of the catalyzed reaction.

Results
The X-ray crystal structures of AphA complexes with the substrate analogue inhibitor PMEA (adefovir)18 (AphA­PMEA), with the transition-state analogue aluminum fluoride (AphA­Al), and with the intermediate analogue beryllium fluoride (AphA­Be), compared with the structure of the native enzyme, provide relevant information about the catalytic mechanism of AphA. The data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Table 1. Despite the quite large number of AphA structures determined by our group up to now, no real "native" AphA was available, as the best approximation to a native structure was the bromine derivative used for the structure determination by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction methods,8 which is at relatively low resolution [2.2 Å; Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 1N9K] and brings seven bromide anions bound. For this reason, we have determined the AphA native structure at 1.7 Å resolution (PDB code: 3CZ4).

480 ducts themselves are bound into the active site. Hence, the presence of a ligand mimicking one of the steps of the AphA catalytic cycle appears to represent a necessary but insufficient condition for the closing of loop 6. It is puzzling that the inspection of the structures does not reveal an evident explanation for this (apparently) systematic behavior. When loop 6 is in the closed conformation, two H-bonds are established with residues at the opposite ends of the loop: the H-bond between Asn150 carboxylate and the backbone NH of Lys152 and the H-bond between the Thr151 side chain and the backbone carbonyl of Gly144. These two H-bonds are maintained in all loop 6 closed conformations observed so far. AphA complexed with the PMEA inhibitor The effect of PMEA on the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) substrate by AphA5 was assessed by measuring the hydrolysis rate of the substrate at different PMEA concentrations. Figure 2 shows that PMEA behaves as a purely competitive inhibitor of AphA with a Ki of 2.1 ± 0.2 M. These observations, together with the chemical similarity to the AMP substrate, indicate that PMEA can be considered a substrate analogue of AphA.19 The structure of the AphA­PMEA complex, obtained by co-crystallization of the native enzyme with PMEA, has been determined to 2.00 Å resolution (PDB code: 2G1A). The two independent AphA subunits present in the crystal asymmetric unit are identical within the experimental error (RMSD on C atoms: 0.28 Å), with the exception of the conformation of loop 6, as already mentioned. The differences between the two conformations involve a movement by more than 10 Å and the twisting of the loop as it can be appreciated from Fig. 1b. Both subunits host one PMEA molecule bound into the active-site cavity. The ligand PMEA, commercially available as adefovir, is an acyclic adenosine derivative, where the distinctive phosphoribosyl moiety of the nucleoside is replaced by an ethoxymethylphosphonic group, which cannot be hydrolyzed by AphA. The observed PMEA binding to AphA can then indicate the specificity of the aromatic binding recognition pocket and simulate the substrate approach to the enzyme. The structure of the AphA­PMEA complex shows well-defined electron density for PMEA, allowing refinement at full occupancy in both AphA-independent subunits as shown in Fig. 3. The binding of the two PMEA molecules differs by the orientation of the adenine ring. The PMEA purine moiety is involved in an aromatic stacking with side chains of residues Phe56 and Tyr193, but in subunit A, the ring is rotated by about 180° with respect to that one present in subunit B. Several H-bonds involving the protonated nitrogen atoms of the purine ring complete the PMEA binding to the hydrophobic cleft.

The Catalytic Mechanism of the Mg-Phosphatase AphA

However, due to the different orientation of the purine rings, the H-bond network is different in subunits A and B. On the contrary, the structure shows an identical binding mode for the phosphonomethoxyethyl moiety in the two subunits. The phosphonate group is located close to the Mg(II) ion, but it does not enter into the metal ion coordination sphere, leaving the native Mg(II) coordination unaltered. The structure shows that PMEA acts as a second sphere ligand to Mg(II), being involved in a network of hydrogen bonds with the metal-coordinated water molecules (Fig. 3) and indicating the inability of the ligand to replace the metal-coordinated water molecules. One of three oxygen atoms of the phosphonate group is H-bonded to O of Asp44, to the backbone N atom of Gly113, and to N of Lys152, which, in turn, donates a second hydrogen bond to the carboxylic oxygen of Asp44. A second oxygen of phosphonate is involved in a network of hydrogen bonds with three water molecules, the first two of which are coordinated to Mg(II) and the other is bridged to the OH group of Tyr193. Finally, the methoxy oxygen of PMEA is H-bonded to a water molecule that bridges it to the carboxylic oxygen of the catalytic Asp44. AphA complexed with AlF3 The structure of the complex AphA­Al (PDB code: 2HF7) has been obtained from crystals soaked in a solution of aluminum fluoride. As in the previous complex, the two subunits present in the crystal asymmetric unit show different conformations of loop 6, which maintains the already described sets of noncovalent interactions in the two different conformations. Both AphA subunits display significant electron density in the active site, which is easily interpreted as one AlF3 molecule covalently bound in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry to Asp44 O1 and to a putative water molecule (Fig. 4). The two independent AlF3 molecules bind the enzyme in the same way. Since the soaking solution contained a mixture of - AlF3 and AlF4 and since the electron density of a fluorine atom is not significantly different from that of a water molecule, one or both of the waters bound to Al (Wat611 in chain A and Wat612 in chain B) could be, in principle, a fluoride ion (Fig. 4). However, in both subunits, a hydrogen bond links the carboxylate side chain of Asp46 to the apex of the AlF3X2 bipyramid, indicating that the apical ligand is most probably a water molecule. The binding of AlF3 moiety is completed by hydrogen bonds received by the remaining fluorides from Lys152 N, Gly113 NH, Asn44 NH, Ile45 NH, and Thr122 OH (Fig. 4). The bipyramidal aluminum complex represents a very good analogue of the pentacoordinated phosphorus transition state required by the concerted or associative­dissociative pathways,11,20,21 and many examples of the usefulness of such complex to investigate the

structure shows that BeF2, in the presence of fluoride, reacts with AphA, leading to a derivative where - BeF 3 is covalently bound to Asp44 O 1 (Be1 = 1.50 Å). Asp44 O1 and the three fluorine O atoms display a nearly ideal tetrahedral geometry around Be (Fig. 5). One fluorine is coordinated to magnesium ion (Mg-F = 1.90 Å), and the remaining fluorine atoms are H-bonded to N of Lys152, to the

side chain OH of Thr112, and to the peptide NHs of Ile45 and Gly113 (Fig. 5). Three water molecules are within H-bonding distance from the fluorine atoms, and, interestingly, one of them (Wat118), while Hbonded to Asp46 O2, points directly towards the Be atom from the face of the tetrahedron containing the - three F atoms (Fig. 5). The BeF3 adduct of AphA not only represents the tetrahedral phosphoenzyme intermediate but also directly indicates that Wat118 is the postulated nucleophile involved in the dephosphorylation step of the catalytic mechanism assisted by an Asp46 acting as a general base.9

Discussion
In a previous work,9 we have proposed a possible mechanism for the hydrolysis of aromatic phosphate monoesters by AphA based on crystallographic evidence and on the analogy with other metallophosphatases of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily.9,12,24,25 Our early proposal favors an associative mechanism that involves the formation of a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate and two flanking five coordinate transition states (see Scheme 1 in Ref. [9]). Five of the six steps proposed9 entail the formation of a coordination bond between phosphate and the Mg(II) ion in such a way that the metal ion has a role in bringing the reagents of the

This Dixon plot shows that PMEA behaves as a pure competitive inhibitor of AphA as the three lines intersect above the abscissa at the PMEA Ki value.

first part of the reaction (phosphate and Asp44) in close proximity, in substrate activation, and in transition-state stabilization. The analysis of the four crystal structures described here provides high-resolution snapshots that are useful when discussing some aspects of the above reaction mechanism. The AphA­PMEA complex confirms the role of the hydrophobic pocket defined by Leu71, Phe56, and Tyr193 as the substrate specificity site, explaining the preference of AphA for aromatic phosphoesters and nucleotides. Furthermore, the distance between such site and the reaction site explains the strict specificity towards monophosphate substrates. The phosphonate moiety of PMEA does not enter the Mg(II) coordination sphere but docks to a site lined by Lys152 side chain and Thr112Gly113 backbones. Such site clearly defines an anion hole where anions of a different kind such as acetate and phosphate have been found bound in other crystal structures (data not shown).9 This explains the role of Lys152 in the reaction mechanism and the hydrogen-bonding pattern that links this residue

side chain in this site. The phosphorus atom of PMEA is at about 5.0 Å from Mg and 4.0 Å from Asp44 O1, which is the nucleophile for the first reaction step. It is interesting to notice that in two complexes of AphA with the reaction products adenine and phosphate, two different phosphate binding modes have been observed: in one instance, the phosphate is bound to Mg(II) (PDB code: 1RMW), while in the other structure (PDB code: 1RM7), phosphate is superimposable to the position observed for the phosphonate group in the PMEA complex. The fact that PMEA is found not directly bound to Mg(II), despite the higher Lewis base character of its phosphonyl group with respect to the AMP phosphoryl group,19 suggests that the coordination of such moiety (as well as that of phosphate) might be dependent on the protonation state of these groups once bound to the active-site cavity. The studies on other magnesium phosphatases such as phosphoserine phosphatase,12 mitochondrial 5(3)-deoxyribonucleotidase,22 and -phosphoglucomutase26 suggest a role for Mg(II) ions in

The first step involving the substrate binding to the enzyme might be represented as well by that depicted in step 1 of the reaction scheme reported in Ref. [9].

docking and activating the substrate phosphate and in the electrostatic stabilization of the developing negative charges in the transition state. Our data indicate a similar role in AphA although they do not allow us to establish whether the substrate phosphate group enters the Mg(II) coordination sphere before the attack by Asp44 or whether the binding to the metal ion and the nucleophilic attack by Asp44 are a concerted event. However, the structure of the complex might show the approach of the substrate to the Mg(II) ion (before step 1 in Scheme 1) and highlights the role played by Lys152 in docking the

phosphate group as indicated also by a recent study on AphA from Salmonella typhimurium.27 The AphA­Be and AphA­Al adducts show, beyond doubt, that the overall reaction proceeds through a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate and two flanking five-coordinate transition states, confirming the proposed addition­elimination pathway. The AphA­Al complex indicates that the enzyme active site is suited to bind a five-coordinate phosphorus transition state where the developing charge separation is stabilized by the coordination to the

485 act as the proton donor of the leaving riboside product (step 3) arises from the observation of a direct H-bond between ribose and Asp46 in one subunit of the AphA­deoxycytosine complex (PDB code: 1RMY).9 In step 6, the product is represented as dihydrogenphosphate. This is consistent with the observation of a phosphate species bound as a second sphere ligand to the Mg(II) coordination octahedron in an AphA­adenosine­phosphate ternary complex (PDB code: 2B8J). In this structure, phosphate lies at about 4.4 Å from Mg(II) and has lost the H-bonds with Ile45 and Thr112 present when it is directly coordinated to the metal ion. The biprotonated state of phosphate appears as a plausible way to weaken the interaction of this group with the enzyme in order to facilitate its leaving of the active-site cavity and the reestablishment of the active enzyme. The work done on AphA by us and other groups has described in great detail the phosphatase/phosphotransferase activity of the enzyme and the catalytic mechanism towards nucleotide substrates. AphA, therefore, can be considered a broad-spectrum nucleotidase highly active against both 3- and 5-nucleotides and -deoxynucleotides. These findings would suggest that AphA could play its physiological role in scavenging nucleotides that enter the periplasmic space, to release nucleosides and inorganic phosphate. However, since E. coli also produces two periplasmic nucleotidases specific for 3-nucleotides (CpdB)28 and 5-nucleotides (UshA),29­31 the physiological significance of AphA in utilization of exogenous nucleotides remains to be clarified. In this respect, it is interesting to notice that a recent work has demonstrated that, in vitro, AphA, coupled to asparaginase II (AsnB), is able to synthesize phosphoribosyl amine, the first intermediate in the purine/thiamine synthesis pathway.32 The above considerations clearly point out that further efforts are needed to fully understand the physiolo-

Mg(II) ion and by the positive site defined by the peptide NH of Ile45 and Gly113 and the side chain of Lys152 (Fig. 4). The AphA­Be complex shows the structure of the covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate and provides clues about the dephosphorylation step (step 4 in Scheme 1). The comparison between native AphA, AphA­Be, and AphA­Al structures allows us to follow the approach of a water molecule to the tetrahedral intermediate, assisted by H-bonding to the side chain of Asp46 leading to the transition state as shown in Fig. 6. This provides convincing evidence that the nucleophile of the second part of the reaction is a water molecule and beautifully explains the active-site architecture of the phosphatases of the DDDD family where an Asp residue is always bound to Mg(II) by the carbonyl oxygen in order to maintain its side chain free to activate the nucleophile in this step of the reaction. The analysis of the data reported here suggests that the previously proposed mechanism9 should be reviewed as reported in Scheme 1 where the main difference with respect to the previous proposal lies in the identification of the water nucleophile in step 4. A further difference consists in the mode for the substrate approach to the nucleophile based on the observation of the AphA­PMEA structure (Fig. 3) possibly anticipating the binding of the phosphate to the Mg(II) ion, as depicted in step 1 of Scheme 1. We miss experimental evidence to establish the succession of events that lead to transition state 1 (step 2) where the five-coordinate phosphorus atom is bound both to the metal ion and to Asp44. It might well be that the covalent bond to Asp44 is formed after the coordination of the phosphorus to magnesium, but a concerted attack or even the reverse sequence of events cannot be excluded. Other speculative aspects of the mechanism reported in Scheme 1 refer to the protonation states of phosphate and of Asp46. The possibility of Asp46 to

The figure nicely indicates a possible pathway for the water nucleophile approaching and reacting with the phosphoenzyme intermediate in the second part of the AphA catalytic cycle. The water nucleophile is identified with the water molecule, which is found H-bonded to Asp46 side chain in every structure. The sequences of the X-ray structures point towards Asp46 as the general acid/base catalyst required in the catalytic cycle.

The Catalytic Mechanism of the Mg-Phosphatase AphA

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation and crystallization The aphA gene from E. coli MG1655 was cloned in the E. coli host DH5a for overproduction, as previously described.2,7 The recombinant AphA protein has been purified following a specifically developed procedure and crystallized as reported earlier.7 Diffraction quality crystals have been obtained from a sitting-drop setup with drops containing 2 L of enzyme solution (4.2­3.5 mg/mL in 50 mM CH3COONa buffer at pH 7.2 and 10 mM MgCl2) and 2 L of a precipitant solution [18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 and 0.6% (w/v) spermine] in the same buffer. The drops were equilibrated in a cooled crystallization incubator (RUMED Rubarth Apparate GmbH model 3001) at 6 °C against 100 L of the precipitant solution. The crystals of the AphA­PMEA complex were obtained by co-crystallization as previously described, using a protein solution (4.2 mg/mL in 50 mM CH3COONa buffer at pH 7.2 and 10 mM MgCl2), containing 10 mM PMEA. The AphA­Be and AphA­Al derivatives were prepared by soaking the native crystals at 4°C in 50 mM CH3COONa buffer (pH 7.2), 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, and 50 mM NaF containing 10 mM BeCl2 or 10 mM AlCl3. Before data collection, the crystals were flash-frozen in the crystallization solution plus 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol under a cold nitrogen stream. Enzyme inhibition assay The AphA inhibition assay was performed by following the published protocol.5 In brief, increasing concentrations of PMEA were reacted at 30 °C in 500 L total volume of a 2.0-nM AphA solution buffered at pH 6.0 with 20 mM sodium acetate containing 1 mM MgCl2 and using 1 mM pNPP as substrate at different concentrations. Cleavage of pNPP was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the released p-nitrophenol at 399.0 nm ( = 1900 M- 1 cm- 1) from reaction mixtures of enzyme­substrate­inhibitor. The Ki of PMEA has been measured at three nonsaturating concentrations (79, 158, and 315 M) of the substrate pNPP. The plots of V0/Vi as a function of [PMEA] were linear, yielding a Ki of 2.1 ± 0.2 M. A Dixon plot was used to assess the inhibitory profile of PMEA. Data collection and processing All data collections have been carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France); the AphA­PMEA data were collected on beamline ID14-1, while the native, AphA­Al, and AphA­Be data sets were collected on ID14-4. The data collection statistics are reported in Table 1. All the data sets were processed using the program MOSFLM33 and scaled with the program SCALA34 from the CCP4 suite.35 Structure determination and refinement All the four structures were solved using the molecular replacement technique; the model used was that of a

subunit of adenosine-derivatized AphA (PDB code: 2B82) with all the water molecules and ions omitted. The correct orientation and translation of the molecule within the crystallographic unit cell were determined with standard Patterson search techniques,36,37 as implemented in the software MOLREP.35,38­40 The program provided an evident solution for the positioning for the asymmetric unit content. The first two or three N-terminal residues (depending on the data set) present in the construct were not visible in the electron density map and are not part of our model; in all cases, the C-terminal residue had a very clear electron density. The refinement was carried out by using REFMAC5.35,41 Between the refinement cycles, the model was subjected to manual rebuild using XtalView.42 The same program has been used to model the various ligands. Water molecules have been added in all cases by using the standard procedure within the ARP/wARP suite.43,44 The stereochemical quality of the refined model was assessed using the program PROCHECK.45 The refinement statistics are reported in Table 1. Figure 1a and b was prepared using the program PyMOL.46 All other figures have been generated using CCP4MG from the CCP4 suite.35 PDB accession codes The coordinates and the structure factors for the three complexes have been deposited in the PDB under the following accession codes: native AphA, 3CZ4; AphA­ PMEA, 2G1A; AphA­Be, 2HEG; AphA­Al, 2HF7.
