Hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) is a 38 kDa class I nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that is strongly expressed in T cells. It is composed of a C-terminal classical PTP domain (residues 44­ 339) and a short N-terminal extension (residues 1­43) that functions to direct HePTP to its physiological substrates. Moreover, HePTP is a member of a recently identified family of PTPs that has a major role in regulating the activity and translocation of the MAP kinases Erk and p38. HePTP binds Erk and p38 via a short, highly conserved motif in its N terminus, termed the kinase interaction motif (KIM). Association of HePTP with Erk via the KIM results in an unusual, reciprocal interaction between the two proteins. First, Erk phosphorylates HePTP at residues Thr45 and Ser72. Second, HePTP dephosphorylates Erk at PTyr185. In order to gain further insight into the interaction of HePTP with Erk, we determined the structure of the PTP catalytic domain of HePTP, residues 44­339. The HePTP catalytic phosphatase domain displays the classical PTP1B fold and superimposes well with PTP-SL, the first KIM-containing phosphatase solved to high resolution. In contrast to the PTP-SL structure, however, HePTP crystallized with a well-ordered phosphate ion bound at the active site. This resulted in the closure of the catalytically important WPD loop, and thus, HePTP represents the first KIM-containing phosphatase solved in the closed conformation. Finally, using this structure of the HePTP catalytic domain, we show that both the phosphorylation of HePTP at Thr45 and Ser72 by Erk2 and the dephosphorylation of Erk2 at Tyr185 by HePTP require significant conformational changes in both proteins.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases Reversible protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an important signal transduction mechanism for regulating a variety of cellular processes.1 The phosphotyrosine (PTyr) content of cells is the net result of the reciprocal action of protein tyrosine kinases

(PTKs), enzymes that add phosphate groups to proteins, and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), enzymes that remove phosphates from proteins.2,3 To date, most studies have focused on the role of PTKs in phosphotyrosine signal transduction cascades. In contrast comparatively little is known about the regulation and specificity of PTPs, proteins that were initially believed to function primarily as "house-keeping" enzymes with broad specificities. During the last 15 years, this view has changed. It is now widely recognized that many PTPs play equally important roles in the regulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, and are subject to the tight regulation and high specificity originally reserved for PTKs.2­5 More importantly, it is now known that disruption of normal PTP activities is associated with a variety of devastating

Structure of the HePTP Catalytic Domain

151 HePTP is a small class I classical non-receptor PTP, which consists of a canonical PTP catalytic domain in its C-terminal domain (residues 44­339) with a short N-terminal extension (residues 1­43; Figure 1(a)). The physiological substrates of HePTP include the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases Erk1, Erk2, and p38,10­12,14 which associate physically with the short N-terminal domain of HePTP. Thus, HePTP can regulate these kinases in two ways. First, HePTP efficiently dephosphorylates the phosphotyrosine residue in the activation loop of these MAP kinases, thereby inactivating them,10­12 and second, HePTP can sequester them by forming stable 1-to-1 complexes, thereby preventing them from translocating to the nucleus.15 The residues in HePTP responsible for this interaction have been localized to positions 15­30, a region referred to as the kinase interaction motif (KIM). HePTP associates through this motif with the inactive, unphosphorylated forms of Erk and p38 in resting leukocytes. Activation of T cells by T cell antigen receptor ligation results in the phosphorylation of HePTP at Ser2316 as well as phosphorylation of Erk2 at its activation loop. The phosphorylation of Ser23 causes the HePTP:Erk2 complex to dissociate.11 Activated, unbound Erk is

illnesses, including numerous cancers such as leukemia and Hodgkin's disease, as well as immunological diseases, metabolic syndromes, neurological disorders, and monogenic inherited diseases.5,6 Understanding how PTPs interact with their substrate and non-substrate-binding proteins in molecular detail will lead to a rational design of specific molecular therapeutics to treat these diseases. Hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase Hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) is a 38 kDa PTP with 339 amino acid residues,7 found exclusively in the white blood cells in bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and all myeloid and lymphoid cell lines.7,8 The phosphatase activity of HePTP negatively regulates T cell activation and proliferation, as overexpression of HePTP (but not a catalytically inactive mutant) in T cells reduces T cell receptor (TCR)-induced transcriptional activation.9­12 The importance of HePTP is underscored by the findings that HePTP often is dysregulated in the preleukemic disorder myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as in acute myelogenous leukemia.13

The N-terminal domain of HePTP (cyan) includes the kinase interaction motif (KIM, pink, residues 15­30) while the C-terminal domain includes the PTP domain (orange, residues 44­339). The HePTP domain solved to high resolution is that of the PTP catalytic domain (residues 44­339). (b) Secondary structure of HePTP catalytic domain. Secondary structure elements numbered as for PTP1B. The bound phosphate ion is shown as a space-filling model in red. Four residues of the loop connecting b-strand 4 to b-strand 7 (b-strands 5 and 6 are not present in HePTP) could not be modeled and are presumably disordered. (c) PTP motifs in HePTP.

152 then able to translocate to the nucleus, where it initiates a set of transcription events required for T cell activation. Some 30­60 min later, several mitogen-activated phosphatases begin to accumulate in the nucleus, and dephosphorylate and inactivate Erk2,17 which then shuttles back to the cytosol and re-associates with HePTP. This dual phosphatase regulation of Erk2 is referred to as the "sequential phosphatase model" and is an example of how different PTPs are used in a spatially and temporally ordered manner to control the extent, location, and duration of MAP kinase activation. HePTP is one member of a family of KIMcontaining phosphatases that include striatal enriched phosphatase, STEP, and the STEP-like PTP, PTP-SL/PCPTP, both of which are expressed predominantly in brain. As observed for HePTP, it has been reported that both STEP and PCPTP also bind Erk and p38 through a short motif highly similar to that in HePTP.18,19 Thus, the binding and regulation of MAP kinases is a common feature of this subgroup of PTPs. In addition, functional studies have shown that there must be at least three points of contact between HePTP and its MAP kinase binding partners. First, and most importantly, MAP kinases bind HePTP via the KIM domain of HePTP. This binding motif is essential, as HePTP deletion constructs without this motif are unable to bind MAP kinases.12 Second, HePTP binds and dephosphorylates the phosphorylated tyrosine residue of active MAP kinases.10 Third, HePTP residues Thr45 and Ser72 are phosphorylated by the bound MAP kinase.10 Thus, there are at least two, if not three, functional conformations of the KIM-containing phosphatase:MAP kinase interaction. To begin to elucidate the structural basis of these multiple interactions, we have solved the structure of the C-terminal catalytic PTP domain of HePTP (residues 44­339).

and a3. Finally, the Q-loop, which contains the conserved Gln314 that positions and activates an active site water molecule for nucleophilic attack, is located between a5 and a6. The HePTP structure includes helix a0, which is not present in PTP-1B, but is a highly conserved secondary structural element within the KIM-containing PTP family (Figure 1(c)). For a detailed description of the structurally conserved motifs and the catalytic mechanism of PTPs in general, the reader is referred to reviews by Andersen et al.21 and Salmeen & Barford.22 Structure of the active site From the early stages of refinement, a wellordered, tetrahedral-shaped electron density was observed near the catalytic Cys270 Sg atom. Since the crystallization mother liquor contained 1.5 M phosphate, the density was refined as a phosphate ion and the structure is thus likely to represent a product complex. In support of this conclusion, the WPD loop of HePTP has closed around the active site relative to that of PTP-SL/PTPBR7,23 suggesting it is in the "closed" substrate-bound conformation. The phosphate electron density and the closed WPD loop are shown in Figure 2(a) and (b). This is only the second PTP phosphatase domain crystallized with a phosphate ion at the active site (PTP-L1 was the first),24 and the first from the KIM-containing PTP family. The phosphate ion is well defined, with strong electron density, and is well-ordered as evidenced by its low atomic B-factors. Three of the phosphate oxygen atoms interact with the backbone amide groups of the phosphate-binding loop, which form the base of the active site, forming hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogen atoms of residues Ala272, Ile274, Gly275, and Arg276 (Figure 2(c)). The phosphate oxygen atoms O2 and O3 also hydrogen bond to the guanidinium nitrogen atoms of the conserved PTP motif arginine, Arg276. In apo-PTP structures, the side-chain of this conserved arginine is normally in an extended conformation.20,23 In the HePTP structure, and other PTP structures with oxyanions bound at the active site, however, the side-chain of this arginine is rotated about its Cg atom by w908 towards the PTyr-binding pocket. This arginine rotomer conformation is characteristic of PTP domains with "closed" WPD loops (Figure 2(b)).25­27 The rotation of the arginine sidechain enables its guanidinium group to hydrogen bond to the bound phosphate oxygens, stabilizing the bound state. This rotation is coupled with the closure of the WPD loop, which enables the conserved acid-base catalytic aspartic acid residue, Asp236 in HePTP, to rotate towards the active site and interact with the bound phosphate. This phosphate oxygen atom also hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of the conserved, catalytic Gln314, and two well-ordered water molecules. The bound phosphate ion and the conformation and orientation of Arg276 and Asp236, are

Results
The HePTP structure The catalytic phosphatase domain of HePTP (HePTP residues 44­339; Figure 1) crystallizes in space group P61 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The three-dimensional structure has been refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 16.2% ° (free R-factor of 18.6%; Table 1) to 1.85 A resolution. With the exception of one poorly defined loop, 179GKEK, and the termini, N44 and 335EEPSP, the model is well-ordered. The HePTP phosphatase domain displays the classical PTP1B fold,20 with a central highly twisted b-sheet composed of nine b-strands flanked by 12 a-helices (Figure 1(b)). The PTP signature motif, (I/V)HCXAGXGR(S/T) (268VHCSAGIGRT in HePTP), which forms the base of the catalytic site and functions as the phosphate-binding loop, is located between b12 and a4. The WPD loop, which contains the general acid-base catalyst Asp236, is located between b11

Electron density maps clearly illustrate the tetrahedral-shaped density of the phosphate ion. (b) Reorientation of the WPD loop upon phosphate binding. The superposition of the active site of HePTP (orange) and apo-PTP-SL (blue) is shown. The binding of the phosphate ion leads to the rotation of the Arg276 side-chain about the Cg atom, the closing of the WPD loop and the subsequent reorientation of the catalytic acid Asp236 in HePTP relative to PTP-SL. The HePTP and PTP-SL structures ° have been superimposed over 253 residues with an rmsd of 0.72 A. (c) Dual conformations of active site residues His237 and Gln314. The hydrogen bonding network of the bound phosphate ion is shown. Residues from the WPD loop (purple), PTP motif phosphate-binding loop (coral) and Q-loop (cyan) interact with the bound phosphate. Water molecules are shown as stars. The dual conformations of His237 (WPD loop) and Gln314 (Q loop) are shown.

consistent with PTP product complexes with a closed WPD loop, prior to product release.26 Many of the residues in the WPD loop (HePTP residues 232­239) change conformation in order to accommodate this large rotation. In the open state of PTP-SL, a salt-bridge between PTP-SL residues Lys448 and Asp451 functions to stabilize the openstate of the WPD loop. In the closed-state of HePTP, the corresponding residues, Gln238 and Glu241, respectively, do not interact, suggesting the Lys448-Asp451 salt-bridge observed in the PTP-SL structure is broken upon WPD loop closure. Notably, the side-chains of two residues located at the HePTP active site showed electron density consistent with two distinct, equally likely conformations (Figure 2(c)). These residues are His237, the

residue immediately following the conserved acidbase Asp236 in the WPD loop, and the catalytically important Gln314 of the Q-loop. The side-chain of His237 has two equally likely conformations, which differ from one another by a rotation about the Cb atom of w158. In the first conformation, the imidazole side-chain is located directly above the bound phosphate, while in the second, it is rotated away from the active site pointing towards the solvent. This rotation of His237 imidazole group is accompanied by a correlated rotation of Gln314, which results in a breaking of the hydrogen bond between the Gln314 hydroxyl with the phosphate oxygen atom. These correlated dual conformations of the His327 and Gln314 side-chains reflect the natural propensity for conformational flexibility in the WPD loop residues, and are suggestive of the

154 types of coordinated conformational changes that may occur upon WPD loop opening. Conserved salt-bridge and motion of the loop containing conserved Glu178 In addition to interacting with the phosphate ion, the guanidium group of Arg276 also forms a conserved salt-bridge with the carboxyl group of residue Glu178.21 This glutamic acid residue is 100% conserved within in the PTP family21 and the salt-bridge it forms with the PTP motif arginine has been observed in PTP structures with both open (apo) and closed (substrate/oxyanion bound) WPD loops.23,24,28 This indicates that this conserved glutamic acid residue is able to reorient upon substrate binding in order to maintain its interaction with the PTP motif arginine side-chain, which itself changes conformation in order to hydrogen bond to the bound oxy-anion moiety. To accommodate this motion, the loop containing Glu178 must be fairly flexible. This flexibility is observed in the HePTP structure. The B-factors for the main-chain atoms of the first three residues in ° this loop, Leu176­Glu178, are very high (w60 A2) and the last four of the residues of this loop, Gly179­Lys182, could not be modeled because of a lack of clear electron density. In contrast, the carboxylate oxygen atoms of HePTP Glu178 are ° well-ordered, with B-factor values of only w30 A2. The high mobility of this loop is observed in the other KIM phosphatase structures, PTP-SL23 and STEP (PDB code ID 2BIJ). Specifically, the B-factors for the atoms of this loop in the PTP-SL structure are much higher than those of the adjacent residues and the four residues not visible in HePTP structure were also not observed in the electron density map of the STEP structure. The KIM-containing phosphatase family In addition to HePTP, the catalytic phosphatase domains of two other KIM-containing PTPs have been solved to atomic resolution, including the PTP catalytic domain of striatal-enriched phosphatase (STEP; PDB code 2BIJ) and STEP-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP-SL; PDB code 1JLN).23 The sequence alignment of these domains is shown in Figure 3(a). HePTP is 54.4% and 51.3% identical with PTP-SL and STEP within these domains. As expected, the three-dimensional structures of the other KIM-containing phosphatase domains, STEP and PTP-SL, are similar to that of HePTP (Figure 3(b)). The majority of the differences between these three KIM-containing phosphatases are localized to loop regions. The root mean square ° deviations (RMSD) between the models are 0.99 A over 244 residues between HePTP and STEP, and ° 0.72 A over 253 residues between HePTP and PTPSL. In contrast, when the loops are included in the superpositions, the RMSD values between the ° models are much higher, 2.13 A over 273 residues

° for HePTP and STEP, and 1.58 A over 282 residues for HePTP and PTP-SL. Differences in the a0 helix and the first Erk2 phosphorylation site, Thr45 Helix a0, which is not present in phosphatase PTP-1B, is highly conserved within the KIM phosphatase family (Figure 4(a)). It is on the periphery of the molecule, interacting with residues from helix a5 and the extended loop that connects helices a2 0 and ax. Helices a0 from both HePTP and PTP-SL structures superimpose well (the domain of STEP crystallized begins at residue Ser258, and does not include helix a0). As observed in the PTPSL structure, HePTP helix a0 (Thr45­Ala57) is well defined by electron density and well ordered, as evidenced by the low atomic B-factors for the mainchain atoms of this helix. Conserved residue Leu54, located towards the C-terminal end of the helix, is buried in a hydrophobic pocket composed of residues from helix a5 (Leu307) and an extended loop connecting helices a2 0 and ax (Pro84). In contrast, the residues at the beginning of the helix interact less strongly with the rest of the protein, being mostly exposed to solvent. On the basis of the sequence alignment between HePTP, STEP and PTP-SL, it is evident that the STEP and PTP-SL helix a0 contain an additional residue relative to that of HePTP (lysine in PTP-SL and glutamic acid in STEP; Figure 4(b)). The presence of this additional lysine in PTP-SL causes the N-terminal residues of its helix a0 (254PREK, PTP-SL) to be shifted in helical register by one residue relative to those of HePTP (46PRE, HePTP) so the helices superimpose over the following corresponding residues 45PREVTLHFL (HePTP) and 255REKVAMEYL (PTP-SL). Thus, the positions 45TPRE in HePTP and 253TPRE in PTP-SL, which are identical in primary sequence, do not occupy the same position in space. This shift in register propagates through the remaining N-terminal residues, causing the threonine/serine residues, which are the sites of phosphorylation by the MAP kinases Erk/p38, to be in different positions. In the PTP-SL structure, the residues that immediately precede helix a0 fold back towards the catalytic domain, partially burying Ser253 between residues Ala259 of helix a0 and Asn295 of the loop connecting helix a2 0 to helix ax. In contrast, in the HePTP structure, both Thr45 and Pro46 are in a-helical conformations and are the first two residues of helix a0. These differences in conformation of the N-terminal region of helix a0 result in the Ca atoms of the residues Thr45 (HePTP) ° and Ser253 (PTP-SL) to be more than 8 A apart. MAP protein kinases are proline-directed, phosphorylating substrates with a proline residue in the
 The residue phosphorylated by MAP Kinases in PTPSL is Thr253. The crystal structure of PTP-SL contains a Ser residue at this site as a result of a cloning artifact (Thr253Ser).

that the changes in HePTP structure needed for Erk2 phosphorylation can be accommodated easily. Differences in the position of the WPD loop The most significant difference among the three KIM-containing phosphatase structures is the conformation of the WPD loop (Figures 2(b) and 3(b)). In the HePTP structure, which has a phosphate ion bound at the active site, this loop is closed, forming a lid over the active site. In the apoPTP-SL and apo-STEP structures, however, the WPD loops are open, with the STEP WPD loop rotated the furthest away from the active site. The WPD loop closes about the active site with a hingelike motion. The residues that change conformation to mediate the bulk of this rotation are residues Trp234 at the N terminus of the loop and Ser242 at its C terminus. The absolute values of the differences in the f,j angles of these residues with the corresponding residues in the PTP-SL structure are Trp234 (DfZ64, DjZ35) and Ser242 (DfZ31, DfZ34). In addition, there are further conformational changes in the residues of the WPD loop, the largest of which occurs at HePTP residues Asp236 (DfZ17, DjZ168) and His237 (DfZ117, DjZ152). This indicates that the WPD loop does not rotate as a rigid body, but instead changes conformation in residues throughout the loop to mediate loop closure. This is further supported by the fact that the superposition between the backbone atoms of the HePTP WPD loop (234WPDHQTPES) and the PTP-SL WPD loop ° (444WPDHKTPDS) has a high RMSD of 1.2 A. In contrast, the superposition of the secondary structural elements that border the HePTP and PTP-SL WPD loops (b-strand 11, residues 222­233 and a-helix 3, residues 243­254 in HePTP) superimpose on one another with an RMSD of only ° 0.59 A. The backbone atoms of the conserved PTP signature motif (the phosphate-binding loop, HePTP residues 270CSAGIGR) in all three KIMcontaining phosphatase structures are very similar. However, the side-chain of the conserved arginine residue (Arg276) is oriented very differently in the HePTP structure, with the guanidinium group rotating by w908 towards the PTyr-binding pocket to hydrogen bond to the O2 and O3 atoms of the bound phosphate. This is the canonical conformation of this conserved arginine residue in PTP structures with closed WPD loops.25 In contrast, in the open structures of STEP and PTP-SL, the corresponding arginine residues are in extended conformations. As in the HePTP structure, the PTPSL Arg486 forms a salt-bridge with the carboxyl group of the conserved glutamic acid residue (Glu388) in the loop connecting secondary structure elements b4 and b8. This salt-bridge is not observed in the STEP structure and, instead, because of its very open WPD loop, the normally buried PTP phosphate-binding loop arginine residue interacts with solvent.

Helix a0 and the residues that stabilize its interaction with the catalytic PTP phosphatase domain are shown for HePTP (orange) and PTP-SL (cyan). The residues that stabilize the interaction of helix a0 with the phosphatase domain are represented as stick models. The N-terminal portion of both helices are also illustrated as stick models, and the N-terminal residues (Thr45 and Pro46, HePTP; Thr253Ser and Pro254, PTP-SL) are labeled. Thr44 and Thr253Ser residues are the sites of phosphorylation by the MAP kinases Erk/p38. (b) Helix a0 sequence and structure alignment. The residues of helix a0 are aligned first by sequence and second by their position in the high-resolution crystal structures of HePTP and PTP-SL. There is a single residue insertion in PTP-SL and STEP relative to HePTP that causes the N-terminal portion of PTP-SL helix a0 to be shifted in register by one residue relative to that of HePTP.

PC1 position.29 Modeling studies carried out with Erk2 suggest that the most favorable conformations of the PC1 proline residues in peptide substrates for Erk2 are in trans-proline conformations (fZK 608, jZ1508 or fZK608, jZK358), with the former most-preferred because of the increased contacts it can make with residues that line the Erk2 substrate-binding pocket.30 Pro46 in HePTP is in a trans-conformation (fZK568, jZK368) and its side-chain is exposed to solvent, suggesting that it is poised to interact with Erk2. However, on the basis of this structure, it is clear that additional conformational changes are necessary in order to re-orient the HePTP peptide substrate, Thr45Pro46-Arg47, into the more extended conformation required for optimal interaction with MAP kinases. Because the corresponding residues in PTP-SL are oriented so differently relative to HePTP, these residues must be fairly flexible, and thus it is likely

Differences in the helices a1 0 /a2 0 loop and the second HePTP residue phosphorylated specifically by Erk2, Ser72 The loop connecting helix a1 0 and helix a2 0 contains the second residue of HePTP specifically phosphorylated by Erk2, Ser72. Because the sequence of this loop, 68RQPPSPK, is not conserved among the KIM-containing phosphatases, only HePTP is phosphorylated by Erk2 at this position. In PTP-SL and STEP, this loop forms a tight, three residue turn between helix a1 0 and helix a2 0 . In HePTP, however, this loop is much longer, because a-helix a1 0 is one turn shorter in HePTP than the other KIM-containing phosphatases. The three proline residues in HePTP, which are not present in STEP or PTP-SL, force the residues in this loop to form a more extended conformation compared to their KIM-containing phosphatase counterparts. Pro73, which is the PC1 proline residue for Erk2 phosphorylation, is in a trans-conformation (fZ K628, jZ1508), suggesting this peptide may be poised for phosphorylation by Erk2. Since docking of this peptide results in steric overlap between the HePTP and Erk2 proteins, additional conformational changes in HePTP and/or Erk2 are essential in order for this phosphorylation event to occur. Phosphatase activity of HePTP44-339 To verify that the construct of HePTP crystallized (HePTP_44-339, with an N-terminal

MGSDKIHHHHHH purification tag) is catalytically active, we measured the HePTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of the general PTP substrate p-nitrophenol phosphate (pNPP). The kinetic parameters for both native and selenomethionine-labeled HePTP44-339 are given in Table 2. The values for the Michaelis­Menten constant Km and the turnover number kcat are comparable to those obtained for full-length HePTP (data not shown).

Discussion
This structure of the catalytic phosphatase domain of HePTP, whose catalytic activity is comparable to that of full-length HePTP (Table 2), provides new insights into the regulation of MAP kinases by KIM-containing PTPs. In contrast to the KIM-containing phosphatase apo-PTP-SL structure, the HePTP structure has a phosphate ion bound at the active site, and its WPD loop is closed. The structural differences at the active site between these two KIM-containing phosphatase structures illustrate the conformational changes associated with substrate binding, hydrolysis and product release in KIM-containing phosphatases. In order to understand how HePTP binds and dephosphorylates phosphorylated proteins such as Erk2, we superimposed the active sites of HePTP with two PTP1B structures, the first bound to a biphosphorylated peptide segment from insulin receptor kinase (IRK; PDB code 1G1H28) and the second to a mono-phosphorylated peptide from

Structure of the HePTP Catalytic Domain

Figure 5. HePTP:Erk2 peptide model. (a) Superposition of HePTP and the PTP1B:EGFR PTyr peptide complex. HePTP (orange) and PTP1B (light grey; PDB code 1PTU) were superimposed using only the PTP and WPD loops of both structures ° (RMSD 0.42 A). Notably, the peptide-binding loops of both structures (101KDRYKTI in HePTP), which includes the PTyr recognition loop (101KDRY in HePTP) also superimpose nearly identically. The EGFR PTyr peptide bound to PTP1B is shown in dark grey and represented as sticks. The phosphate moiety of the PTyr peptide superimposes nearly identically with the bound phosphate ion of HePTP (orange, stick figure). The strictly conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr46 in PTP1B and

Structure of the HePTP Catalytic Domain

159 First, the PTP1B peptide recognition loop residue Asp48 forms two strong hydrogen bonds with the EGFR peptide backbone, thereby facilitating the orientation of the PTyr peptide into the PTP1B active site. In HePTP, the equivalent residue is Thr106, which, due to its shorter, uncharged sidechain, presumably has weaker interactions with the bound peptide. This observation is supported by kinetic studies of HePTP that demonstrated that the catalytic activity of HePTP towards phosphorylated substrates increased by one to two orders of magnitude when Thr106 was mutated to either aspartic acid or asparagine.31 Because this increase in catalytic efficiency was observed towards only phosphorylated peptides and not towards the biphosphorylated Erk2 protein (Erk2/pTpY), Thr106 has been postulated to function as a negative determinant to restrict HePTP catalytic activity towards HePTP-specific substrates.31 Second, the PTP1B peptide recognition loop residue Arg47 interacts extensively with both the backbone and side-chains of the bound EGFR peptide residues. The Arg47 backbone amide hydrogen bonds to the carboxyl group of peptide residue P-2, while its guanidinium group forms salt-bridges with the peptide side-chains of EGFR residues in the P-1 (Glu) and P-2 (Asp) positions. Arg47 is replaced by Lys105 in HePTP. Although the Lys105 side-chain was not visible in the HePTP electron density map, the charged amine group of Lys105 may interact with the side-chains of Erk2 residues P-1 (Glu) and P-2 (pThr) in a manner similar that observed for PTP1B Arg47. The conformation of the Erk2 activation loop peptide model in Figure 5 differs from its corresponding residues in the crystal structure of bi-phosphorylated Erk2 (2ERK), which superimpose with ° an RMSD of 2.1 A. This suggests that the activation loop of Erk2/pTpY must change conformation in order to bind HePTP at its active site. The observation that substrate peptides change conformation upon binding the active sites of their specific phosphatases has been reported. Most notably, the IRK peptide changes conformation significantly when bound to PTP1B (1GIH) compared to its structure within the IRK protein itself (1IR3), with the corresponding residues superimposing with an ° RMSD of 1.7 A. Furthermore, since the superposition of Erk2 with the bound peptide model results in extensive clashing between the Erk2 and HePTP proteins, we also expect that additional conformational changes in Erk2 and HePTP outside

epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; PDB code 1PTU25). The HePTP active site superimposes onto the active sites of the PTP1B structure extremely ° well, with RMS deviations of only 0.421 A and ° 0.330 A for PTP1B models 1G1H and 1PTU, respectively. Notably, the phosphate ion bound at the HePTP active site and the phosphate moieties of the bound phosphorylated peptides of PTP1B superimpose nearly perfectly (Figure 5(a)). This observation further supports the likelihood that the position of the bound phosphate in HePTP represents the bound phosphate product complex. The peptide-binding loop of HePTP, residues 101KDRYKTI (this loop includes the phosphatase family PTyr (phosphorylated tyrosine) recognition loop, 101KDRY),21 also superimposes extremely well with the peptide recognition loops of the both PTP1B structures. Multiple three-dimensional structures of PTP1B: peptide complexes show that mono-, bi- and triphosphorylated peptides bind PTP1B in a similar manner, with the residues flanking the substrate PTyr adopting an extended b-strand conformation.25,26,28 Because the PTP1B active sites and peptide-binding loops of these PTP1B:pTyr peptide complexes superimpose on the corresponding structural elements of HePTP extremely well, it is likely that HePTP binds the doubly phosphorylated Erk2 activation loop (Erk2/181FLpTEpYV) in a similar manner. We developed a model of the HePTP:Erk2 peptide interaction using the coordinates of the EGFR PTyr peptide bound to PTP1B and the coordinates of the phosphorylated threonine residue from the structure of activated Erk2 (PDB code 2ERK; modeling methods are described in detail in the legend to Figure 5 and model is shown in Figure 5(b) and (c)). The most significant difference between the PTP1B:EGFR structure and the HePTP:Erk2 model, is the presence of a PThr at the P-2 position in the Erk2 peptide. In the HePTP:Erk2 model, the phosphate moiety can easily be reoriented to interact with the backbone amide atoms from HePTP residues 101KDRY by a single rotomer change of the threonine side-chain (Figure 5(b) and (c)). The presence of a phosphorylated threonine residue at this position may facilitate binding of the Erk2 peptide to HePTP. The residues in the peptide-binding loop of HePTP, 101KDRYKTI, also differ from those of PTP1B, 43RNRYRDV, and these differences may contribute to the specificity of these phosphatases for their substrates (Figure 5(a), right panel and (b)).

Tyr104 in HePTP), which define the depths of the PTP active sites, are labeled. Finally, two of the residues that differ between HePTP and PTP1B in the peptide-binding loops are also labeled (Asp48 in PTP1B and Thr106 in HePTP). (b) Stereo Figure of the Erk2 peptide model bound to HePTP. The residues of the EGFR PTyr peptide (oriented by the HePTP:PTP1B superposition; see (a)) were mutated, in silico, to those of the Erk2 activation loop, Erk2 residues 181FLTEpYV. Thr183 was then replaced with PThr coordinates from the activated Erk2 structure for a final sequence of 181FLpTEpYV (PDB code ERK2). The modeled peptide is shown in cyan in stick representation. A single rotomer change for PThr re-orients the phosphate oxygen atoms towards the HePTP structure, enabling them to interact with the HePTP peptide-binding loop residues (101KDRYKTI). The side-chain of the HePTP residue Lys103 was not visible in the electron density map. (c) The HePTP:Erk2 PThrPTyr peptide model surface representation. HePTP (light orange, shown in surface representation) is shown bound to the modeled Erk2 PThrpTyr peptide (cyan, stick representation).

160 the active sites of both proteins are required for optimal binding. In summary, the KIM-containing phosphatase family and their MAP kinase binding partners have multiple points of interaction. First, and most importantly Erk2 binds HePTP via its KIM. Second, HePTP binds and dephosphorylates the phosphorylated tyrosine residue of MAP kinase activation loops. And third, HePTP residues Thr45 and Ser72 are phosphorylated by the bound MAP kinase. This structure of the HePTP catalytic domain shows clearly, for the first time, that both Erk2 and HePTP must change conformation in order for these phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions to occur. In addition, it is also clear that these reactions cannot occur simultaneously, since the sites of phosphorylation on HePTP (Thr45, Ser72) are distal from the HePTP active site. The structure of the phosphate-bound HePTP catalytic domain and the model of the HePTP:Erk2/pTpY peptide provides deeper insights into how KIMcontaining PTPs interact with the MAP kinases Erk/p38. More importantly, it suggests also that significant conformational changes necessary for optimal KIM-containing PTP:MAP kinase binding and activity. Understanding how KIM-containing PTPs bind the MAP kinases Erk/p38, and how these interactions subtly differ from one another, at the atomic level will lead to the design of novel therapeutics that target these interactions with high specificity, and thus have the potential to control and/or cure KIM-containing PTP related cancers, such as acute myelogenous leukemia

30 mM imidazole, while the concentration of NaCl was reduced gradually from 300 mM to 15 mM. The protein was then eluted with a 30 mM­250 mM imidazole gradient (30 column volumes) directly onto a Sepharose HQ POROS anion-exchange column (Boehringer Mannheim). After three column volume washes with 15 mM NaCl, the protein was eluted with a salt gradient from 15 mM­500 mM NaCl (30 column volumes). The protein eluted in a single peak and was exchanged immediately into 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl and concentrated to 10­20 mg/ml by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Orbital). The protein was either immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use or used promptly for crystallization trials. Crystallization The protein was crystallized using the nanovolume vapor-diffusion method. Crystallization robotics with miniaturized volume assemblies were used to set up crystallization trials in specialized 96-well microtiter trays (Greiner) containing 50 nl of protein solution and 50 nl of crystallization solution in a sitting-drop format.32 Each protein was set up with 576 coarse-screen crystallization conditions (Wizard I/II, Cryo I/II (Emerald BioStructures, Bainbridge Island, WA), Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen 2, Crystal Screen Cryo, PEG/Ion Screen, Grid Screen Ammonium Sulfate, Grid Screen PEG 6000, Grid Screen MPD, and Grid Screen PEG/LiCl (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA)) at 20 8C and at 4 8C. Images of each crystal trial were taken at seven days and at 28 days after setup with an Optimag Veeco Oasis 1700 imager and were evaluated manually. Three of the initial nanocrystallization trials produced crystals. Because each of the initial crystal hits contained high concentrations of phosphate (ammonium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium/potassium phosphate), additional manual (1 ml) crystallization trials were carried out using 12 commercially available conditions that contain high concentrations of phosphate (nine conditions in addition to the three that originally produced crystals). Five of the 12 conditions produced crystals in these manual trials. Two conditions with the most promising crystallization hits were optimized, and one led to a condition that produced high-quality crystals. The final crystallization condition contained 1.5 M sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 6.7), 0.075 M sodium acetate. Both selenomethioninesubstituted and native crystals were cryoprotected in 20% (v/v) glycerol (gradual soak, 7 min), prior to diffraction screening and data collection. Data collection and structure determination Data were collected at SSRL Beamline 11.1 at 100 K using an ADSC QUANTUM 4 CCD detector. Data for all crystals were indexed, scaled and merged using HKL2000.33 The structure of the catalytic phosphatase ° domains was phased to 2.6 A using a two wavelength SeMet MAD data set using SOLVE (FOMZ0.53).34 RESOLVE was used for density modification and automatically built 170 residues (FOMZ0.69).35 The HePTP structural homolog PTP-SL/PTPBR7 (PDB code 1JLN; sequence identity 51%)23 was then docked manually into the RESOLVE electron density map, and its position refined using rigid-body refinement against experimental phases using MolRep.36 This model was used in ARP/wARP for automatic model building against the experimental phases and resulted in a model

Materials and Methods
Protein production Hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (Swissprot: P35236) was PCR amplified from a plasmid containing the human, full-length HePTP DNA sequence with primer pairs encoding the phosphatase domain of HePTP. The PCR product was cloned into a modified pBAD plasmid (Invitrogen) that encodes a purification tag consisting of the residues MGSDKIHHHHHH at the amino terminus of the HePTP catalytic phosphatase domain. The entire cloned region was verified by sequencing. Protein expression was performed in Terrific Broth (TB) or selenomethionine-containing medium using the Escherichia coli methionine auxotrophic strain DL41. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml of lysozyme and Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets); DNase-I (10 mg/ml in 1 mM MgCl2 storage buffer) was added just prior to sonication. Immediately after sonication, 0.3 mM PMSF and 1.4 mM b-mercaptoethanol were added to the lysate and the cell debris immediately pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 60,000 g for 45 min at 4 8C. After filtering, the soluble fraction was applied to POROS MC resin charged with nickel (Boehringer Mannheim) previously equilibrated in equilibration buffer (10 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol). The column was then washed with equilibration buffer containing

for HePTP with 259 traced residues that was then used for a second round of ARP/wARP automatic model building ° against the high-resolution 1.85 A native dataset.37 This model resulted in 276 traced residues and the resulting maps were straightforward to interpret. Data statistics are summarized in Table 1. The model was completed by cycles of manual building in O38 coupled with structure ° refinement using RefMac against the 1.85 A resolution, native dataset.39 The final model of HePTP includes residues 45­334 and 286 water molecules; residues 44, 179­183, and 335­339 were not observed in the electron density map. Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the models was carried out using MolProbity40 and the JCSG Structure Validation Central suite, which integrates seven validation tools: PROCHECK 3.5.4,41 SFcheck 4.0,42 Prove 2.5.1,43 ERRAT,44 WASP,45 DDQ 2.0,46 and Whatcheck.47 Michaelis­Menten kinetic assay p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available commercially. The HePTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of the general PTP substrate pNPP was assayed at 30 8C in 0.15 M Bis-Tris (pH 6.0) assay buffer containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. The ionic strength was adjusted to 150 mM with NaCl. The reaction was initiated by addition of various concentrations of pNPP (ranging from 0.1 to 5 km) to the reaction mixture to a final volume of 100 ml. The reaction was quenched by addition of 100 ml of 1 M NaOH. The amount of product p-nitrophenol was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm detected by a ELx808 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.), using a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 MK1 cmK1. The non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without addition of enzyme. The Michaelis­Menten constant and the turnover number were evaluated by fitting the data to the Michaelis­Menten equation, using non-linear regression and the program GraphPad Prismw (version 4.0).
