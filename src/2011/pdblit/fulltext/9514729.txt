Calmodulin: a prototypical calcium sensor
David Chin and Anthony R. Means
Calmodulin is the best studied and prototypical example of the E­F-hand family of Ca2 -sensing proteins. Changes in intracellular Ca2 concentration regulate calmodulin in three

the Ca2 signal. Hence, separate intracellular loci or organelles are potentially distinct compartments of localized Ca2 signalling2 (Fig. 1a). Therefore, Ca2 signals in the nucleus exert different effects from those generated in the cytoplasm or near the plasma membrane of the same cell3. Additionally, the modulation of the amplitude or frequency of Ca2 spikes (AM and FM, respectively) encodes important signalling information4. This has recently been illustrated for cases in which an optimal frequency of intracellular Ca2 oscillations is important for the expression of different genes5. Calcium-regulated proteins: calmodulin How do Ca2 signals produce changes in cell function? The information encoded in transient Ca2 signals is deciphered by various intracellular Ca2 binding proteins that convert the signals into a wide variety of biochemical changes. Some of these proteins, such as protein kinase C, bind to Ca2 and are directly regulated in a Ca2 -dependent manner. Other Ca2 -binding proteins, however, are intermediaries that couple the Ca2 signals to biochemical and cellular changes (Fig. 1b). Among this latter group are a family of proteins that is distinguished by a structural motif known as the E­F hand. An E­F hand consists of an N-terminal helix (the E helix) immediately followed by a centrally located, Ca2 coordinating loop and a C-terminal helix (the F helix). The three-dimensional arrangement of these domains is reminiscent of the thumb, index and middle fingers of a hand, hence the name `E­F hand'. These proteins respond to Ca2 in one of two ways (Fig. 1b). One group (e.g. parvalbumin and calbindin) do not undergo a significant change in conformation on binding Ca2 and function as Ca2 buffers or Ca2 transporters. The second group, the Ca2 sensors, undergo a Ca2 -induced change in conformation6. The most prominent examples of sensors include troponin C (a protein dedicated to regulating striated-muscle contraction), the multifunctional Ca2 transducer calmodulin (CaM), the S100 family of proteins and, most recently, the neuronal myristoylated proteins such as recoverin7. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the ability of a majority of the Ca2 -sensor proteins to integrate Ca2 signals into specific cellular responses are not clearly understood. Much of what we do know about the mechanisms that the sensor proteins use to transduce Ca2 signals is based on information gained from CaM, probably the most intensively studied member of the E­F-hand family of sensors. In the remainder of this article, CaM will therefore serve as a model or prototype for other potential Ca2 transducers. A review of some of the mechanisms responsible for regulating CaM at the subcellular and molecular levels might reveal valuable clues as to how Ca2 -sensor proteins convert Ca2 signals into cellular function. CaM is expressed in all eukaryotic cells where it participates in signalling pathways that regulate many crucial processes such as growth, proliferation and movement. It is relatively small (vertebrate CaM

distinct ways. First, at the cellular level, by directing its subcellular distribution. Second, at the molecular level, by promoting different modes of association with many target proteins. Third, by directing a variety of conformational states in calmodulin that result in target-specific activation. The calmodulin-dependent regulation of protein kinases illustrates the potential mechanisms by which Ca2 -sensing proteins can recognize and generate affinity and specificity for effectors in a Ca2 -dependent manner.

Calcium (as Ca2 ) is an element that is crucial for numerous biological functions. In many organisms, the vast majority of Ca2 is complexed with phosphates to form exo- or endoskeletons that not only serve as structural scaffolds but also buffer the levels of Ca2 within extracellular fluids at ~10 3 M. By contrast, the resting concentrations of intracellular free Ca2 (~10 7 M) is 104 times lower than that outside cells, providing the potential for the ready import of Ca2 into cells, where it can act as a second messenger. Various extracellular stimuli promote the movement of Ca2 either from outside the cell (via plasma-membrane Ca2 channels) or from intracellular stores into the intracellular milieu (Fig. 1a). The Ca2 is released in elemental aliquots called sparks, puffs or waves depending on the extent of the intracellular area covered. This free Ca2 is only briefly available to act as a cellular signal, however, because Ca2 -binding proteins and Ca2 pumps immediately combine to sequester and transport it to intracellular storage sites or outside the cell. The short pulses of Ca2 exert specific changes in cellular function depending on their route of entry into the cell, their local sites of action and, finally, by their pattern of modulation. The particular membrane channel or intracellular receptor responsible for the release of Ca2 exerts considerable influence on the eventual effects of the Ca2 signal1. The mode of cellular entry also influences the site of action of

has 148 residues), evolutionarily highly conserved and comprises four E­F hands. The first two E­F hands combine to form a globular N-terminal domain that is separated by a short flexible linker from a highly homologous C-terminal domain consisting of E­F hands 3 and 4 (Fig. 2). Ca2 sensors must be able to detect and respond to a biologically relevant range of intracellular free Ca2 concentrations. CaM fits this profile as its affinity for Ca2 (Kd 5 10 7 M to 5 10 6 M) falls within the range of intracellular Ca2 concentrations exhibited by most cells (10 7 M to 10 6 M). However, it has additional discrimination for Ca2 , as the Cterminal pair of E­F hands has a three- to fivefold higher affinity for Ca2 than the N-terminal pair of sites. By contrast, many Ca2 -binding proteins with a considerably higher affinity (Kd 10 7 M) act as buffers by sequestering excess free Ca2 , whereas Ca2 -binding proteins with a considerably lower affinity (Kd 10 5 M) could not act as sensors because they are unable to detect the range of changes in intracellular free Ca2 concentrations that normally occur in cells. The two domains of CaM adopt different conformations in the absence or presence of Ca2

(Fig. 2). In the absence of Ca2 , the N-terminal domain of the apo-CaM molecule adopts a `closed' conformation in which the helices in both E­F hands are packed together. By contrast, still in the absence of Ca2 , the C-terminal domain of apo-CaM adopts a `semiopen' conformation in which a partially exposed hydrophobic patch is accessible to solvent. This might allow the C-terminal domain of CaM to interact with some target proteins at resting levels of intracellular free Ca2 (Ref. 8). In the event of a transient rise in Ca2 , the Ca2 ion is coordinated in each Ca2 -binding loop of Ca2 ­CaM by seven, primarily carboxylate, ligands. The binding of Ca2 leads to substantial alterations in the interhelical angles within the E­F hands in each domain and dramatically changes the two domains of CaM to produce more `open' conformations (Fig. 2). These structural rearrangements in CaM result in the concerted exposure of hydrophobic groups in a methionine-rich crevice of each domain that is distinct from the Ca2 -binding loops. The exposure to solvent of these hydrophobic residues is akin to a Ca2 -controlled unfolding of CaM and unleashes considerable free energy. It is this capacity to convert the Ca2 -binding event into biochemical energy that characterizes the Ca2 -sensor proteins and is the basis of their ability to transduce Ca2 signals. Calmodulin: location, mobility and translocation Is CaM regulated at the subcellular level, and how is this related to Ca2 signalling? The concentration and location of CaM do appear to play an important role in regulating its biological activity. CaM constitutes at least 0.1% of the total protein present in cells (10 6 M ­ 10 5 M) and is expressed at even

However, other studies on unstimulated smooth-muscle cells showed that most CaM is bound, possibly to Ca2 -independent binding proteins, at resting concentrations of free Ca2 .

Calmodulin: regulation of effectors An important obstacle to studies on many Ca2 -sensor proteins is the problem of identifying downstream targets. Biochemical and genetic approaches have recently started to identify targets for some of the S100 class of proteins17 and also for members of the myristoylated Ca2 sensors, such as frequenin18. By contrast, CaM has been known for some time to regulate several classes of proteins and enzymes in a Ca2 -dependent manner. The binding of target proteins by CaM raises the affinity of CaM for Ca2 by approximately tenfold19 and sensitizes the CaM­effector complex to changes in Ca2 concentrations. Interestingly, many of the most highly characterized effectors (e.g. the CaMdependent adenylyl cyclases, phosphodiesterases, protein kinases and the protein phosphatase calcineurin) are directly or

Low [Ca2+] indirectly involved in protein phosphorylation. CaM also regulates the activities of the plasmamembrane Ca2 pump, various ion channels, the ryanodine receptor and isoforms of the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor. The list of CaM targets is extensive and constantly growing (Table 1). Are there differences in the mechanisms by which CaM and other Ca2 transducers regulate their targets? CaM performs a variety of roles, and CaMbinding proteins can be categorized into at least six classes based on their modes of regulation in the presence and absence of Ca2 (Fig. 4). One group of effectors, which we designate class A, binds essentially irreversibly to CaM irrespective of Ca2 . CaM is thus more appropriately considered a subunit of these proteins. One example is phosphorylase kinase, an enzyme that requires denaturing conditions to dissociate CaM but is activated in the presence of Ca2 . Members of a second group of effectors (class B) bind to CaM in the absence of Ca2 (i.e. to the apo-CaM form) but dissociate reversibly in the presence of Ca2 (Ref. 20). Examples include proteins such as neuromodulin and neurogranin, which might serve as intracellular reservoirs for CaM at resting concentrations of Ca2 but liberate Ca2 -activated CaM in response to a transient Ca2 signal. A third group of effectors (class C) includes smooth-muscle myosin-light-chain kinase (MLCK) and calcineurin. These class-C effectors form lowaffinity, inactive complexes with CaM at low concentrations of Ca2 , when CaM is unoccupied or partially occupied by Ca2 [ 2 (mole Ca2 ) (mole CaM) 1]. At high concentrations of Ca2 , these targets engage in a high-affinity complex and are activated by CaM21,22. A fourth class of proteins (class D) binds to CaM in the presence of Ca2 , but, in this case, CaM inhibits their function. This group includes enzymes such as select members of the Gprotein-receptor kinases23, as well as the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor type 124. A fifth group of effectors (class E), such as the CaM-dependent protein kinases I, II and IV, exhibit more conventional behaviour and are activated by Ca2 ­CaM. The class-E targets also exhibit an accessory form of regulation in which CaM binding promotes their regulation (specifically via phosphorylation) by another CaM-regulated kinase (i.e. a CaM-kinase kinase ), which we designate class F. In the specific case of the multimeric CaM kinase II, both the substrate and the catalytic subunits require CaM binding to promote intermolecular autophosphorylation25. This novel case, in which one CaMdependent protein (class E) is directly regulated by another CaM-dependent protein (class F), demonstrates the convergence of different CaM-regulated pathways and is indicative of CaM-signalling cascades. The observation that CaM regulates a specific set of proteins yet engages in different types of Ca2 dependent interactions implies that CaM and its targets both exhibit certain complementary features that enable CaM recognition but possess other aspects that still allow CaM to discriminate between

Ca2 -dependent functions of various classes of calmodulin-binding (CaM-binding) proteins. CaM and various classes of targets exist in free or bound states. Target classes A, B and C are associated with CaM or Ca2 -free CaM (apo-CaM) at low (resting) intracellular free Ca2 concentrations (red).

various classes of effectors. As CaM, like many Ca2 sensors, is a relatively small protein, it must therefore use multiple interaction surfaces to accomplish these ends. These interaction sites enable CaM to convert the energy provided by Ca2 binding into effector regulation. Calmodulin­effector coupling: binding and activation The Ca2 -controlled exposure of hydrophobic groups in the two domains of CaM releases a considerable amount of biochemical energy, which is transduced into two separable effects: a change in the affinity of CaM for the effector and/or an alteration in the effector's function. Studies focusing on one group of CaM-regulated enzymes in particular, the CaM-dependent protein kinases, have provided important insights into some of the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. A short peptide of ~20 residues that is responsible for binding Ca2 ­CaM, designated a CaM-binding domain, has been identified in many CaM-regulated proteins (Fig. 5a) and in other types of CaM-binding proteins26. The crystal structure of CaM kinase I reveals that the CaM-binding domain directly interacts with and sterically obstructs the putative substratebinding sites of the inactive enzyme27. Furthermore, the N-terminal part of the CaM-binding sequence loops away from the enzyme, exposing the hydrophobic side chain of Trp303 to solvent and providing potential access for Ca2 ­CaM to bind (Fig. 5b). This proposal is supported by experiments showing that the mutation of Trp303 to Ser in CaM kinase I significantly lowered the apparent affinity of CaM kinase I for Ca2 ­CaM28.

A homologous hydrophobic residue is conserved in other CaM kinases (Fig. 5a). In the absence of detailed information on complexes between CaM and its intact effectors, spectroscopic and crystallographic studies of Ca2 ­CaM complexed with peptides corresponding to the CaM-binding domains of four CaM kinases including CaM kinase I show in each case that this conserved hydrophobic residue interacts exclusively with the methionine-rich hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal domain of Ca2 ­CaM29­32 (Fig. 5c). Recently determined threedimensional structures of Ca2 ­CaM bound to peptides from the plasma membrane Ca2 ­ATPase pump and a CaM-kinase kinase also reveal additional modes of interaction between CaM and these other CaM-binding peptides33,34. These peptide studies indicate that the C-terminal domain of Ca2 ­CaM might confer binding energy on the intact enzymes. Indeed, this appears to be the case because complementary mutagenesis experiments on the Met residues of CaM showed that an evolutionarily invariant Met124 in the C-terminal domain of Ca2 ­CaM that contacts the conserved hydrophobic residues in several CaM-binding peptides (Fig. 5c) is necessary for high-affinity binding and activation of CaM kinase I as well as for three other CaM-dependent protein kinases35,36. In contrast to the C-terminal domain of Ca2 ­CaM, residues in the hydrophobic pocket of the N-terminal domain of Ca2 ­CaM perform varying functions with different CaM-dependent kinases. The results from the crystallographic studies show that hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal domain of Ca2 ­CaM mainly interact with the Cterminal part of the CaM-binding peptides of smoothmuscle MLCK and CaM kinase II, respectively (Fig. 5a). Progressive C-terminal deletions and chimeric substitutions in the CaM-binding domain of smooth-muscle MLCK showed that the C-terminal half of the CaM-binding domains of these enzymes

are required for Ca2 ­CaM-dependent activation37,38. Furthermore, deletion studies of CaM kinase I show that the C-terminal portion of its CaM-binding sequence confers high affinity for Ca2 ­CaM, as well as CaM-dependent activity39. These results complement those from experiments on CaM showing that the hydrophobic pocket in its N-terminal domain generates a high-affinity complex with CaM kinase II, activates smooth-muscle MLCK and combines the functions of high-affinity binding and activation of CaM kinase I35,40. In comparison with unbound Ca2 ­CaM, the Ca2 ­CaM­peptide complexes exhibit a dramatic contraction enabling CaM to wrap around and sequester the helical CaM-binding peptides (Fig. 5c). Experiments on hydrophilic residues of CaM show that charged and polar residues are also required to activate the smooth-muscle MLCK by promoting the accessibility of substrate to this particular enzyme. Surprisingly, the hydrophilic residues on CaM responsible for this effect are originally separated from each other on both domains of free Ca2 ­CaM by more than 50 Å but then form a stable `latch' less than 5 Å apart in the Ca2 ­ CaM­peptide complex41. These polar groups do not contact the CaM-binding peptide directly, so they might exert their effects on the intact protein kinase by interacting with an area distinct from its CaMbinding domain. Indeed neutron- and X-rayscattering studies on the kinase domain of skeletalmuscle MLCK indicate that the CaM-binding domain is displaced to one side of the enzyme by the binding of Ca2 ­CaM42. This event could expose the substrate-binding site of the enzyme and indicates how CaM might remove an inhibitory CaM-binding domain away from the kinase domain, thus leading to enzyme activation. The preceding mechanistic studies show that the regulation of enzymes by Ca2 ­CaM is a highly ordered, cooperative and complementary process that contributes to both the affinity and specificity for targets. Another surprising outcome is the discovery that the structures of Ca2 ­CaM­peptide complexes are relevant to their corresponding enzymes. However, in addition to the obvious limitation in the use of peptides to study mechanisms of enzyme activation, there are mounting indications that peptides might not be entirely suitable for studying other functions of the full-length target protein. For example, Ca2 has a considerably higher affinity for the CaM­MLCK-peptide complex than for the corresponding CaM­MLCK-enzyme complex19. Also, mutations in the CaM-binding domain of smoothmuscle MLCK have a significantly greater effect on CaM binding and activation than the same changes within the context of the corresponding CaM-binding peptide40. Differences in the Ca2 -dependent interaction of CaM with either the CaM-binding peptide of skeletal-muscle MLCK or the intact enzyme have also been observed by small-angle scattering43. One explanation for the adaptability and the higher affinity exhibited by the shorter CaM-binding domains is the conformational flexibility inherent in isolated peptides. By contrast, the relatively fixed
trends in CELL BIOLOGY (Vol. 10) August 2000

conformation of the intact, folded enzymes restricts their ability to adapt similarly to structural changes within their CaM-binding domains. It is helpful to bear these caveats in mind when peptides are used to model effector function. Perspective and conclusion The extensive characterization of CaM provides a useful precedent for less-well-understood Ca2 sensors. At the subcellular level, the spatial and temporal coordination between Ca2 , CaM and its effectors are important for channelling all three components into a productive signalling pathway. The ability of CaM to integrate Ca2 signals into different cellular contexts by migrating between various compartments further underscores this point. At the intermolecular level, CaM uses different modes of Ca2 dependent interactions, which are responsible for generating high affinity as well as specificity for targets. At the submolecular level, the Ca2 -triggered exposure of energy-donating groups on CaM is coupled to energy-accepting groups on its targets, leading to changes in Ca2 binding by CaM as well as in the function of its effectors. Finally, how are these levels of regulating CaM related to each other? It is likely that the mobility of separate pools of CaM derives from the different interactions between CaM and its targets. Therefore, some classes of proteins might anchor CaM to specific cellular locations, depending on the stability of a particular CaM­effector complex in the absence or presence of a Ca2 signal. The affinity of such complexes is likely to be due to complementary interactions between sites on the target proteins and sites on CaM that change conformation in response to Ca2 . The Ca2 -dependent interactions not only affect the affinity of the complex but also regulate the activity of effectors. This apparent ability of a CaM­effector complex to decode Ca2 signals has been exemplified in a recent study showing that CaM participates in converting Ca2 oscillations into changes in the autonomous enzymatic activity of at least one target, CaM kinase II44. Additional studies on CaM will lead to a more-complete integration of its levels of regulation. Meanwhile, it will be interesting to see whether any of the mechanisms exhibited by CaM will be relevant to other Ca2 sensors. References
