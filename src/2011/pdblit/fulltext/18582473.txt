We report the X-ray structure analysis and refinement at 1-9 A resolution of calf ~-II crystallin, a lens-specific protein. The sequence of Croft (1972) has been modified to give a polypeptide chain of 174 residues (cf. 165). The protein has a symmetrical, hierarchical structure of two globular domains each comprising two similar "Greek key" motifs, consecutive along the polypeptide chain, and related by a pseudo 2-fold axis. The two domains pack together with a single connection and are related by a further pseudo 2-fold axis which bisects the angle between the intra-domain dyads. Forty-two pairs of Ca positions for the two most similar motifs have root-mean-square separation at best fit of 0"69 A. The N and C-terminal domains gave root-mean-square separation of 0-89/~ for 82 pairs of Ca atoms at best fit. In each domain the two Greek key motifs form a pair of four-stranded antiparallel fl-pleated sheets, each sheet composed of three stands from one motif and one from the other. The sheets pack together in a wedge shape, closed at the top by the loops connecting the third and fourth strands of each motif. The first two strands of each motif form an extended fl-hairpin which is folded on to the fl-sheet. The packing of each motif into the globular domains involves a staggered bilayer of side-chains between each pair of fl-sheets which does not preserve the pseudo 2-fold axes observed in the Ca position topology. In the core of each domain there are interactions between polarizable aromatic groups and sulphurcontaining residues which may contribute to stability and may also serve to protect aromatic side-chains from ultraviolet light damage in the lens. At the surface of the molecule over half the ionic side-chains are closely paired, which probably stabilizes the tertiary fold and may reduce the water bound. Crystal lattice interactions are described which may be similar to those occurring in vivo in the lens between crystallins. Seven cysteine residues have been identified in the structure and these may have a role in the thermodynamic stability of the molecule, its intermolecular interactions under the normal reducing conditions of the lens, and also in the aggregation and cross-linking which occur in some forms of cataract. Three of these residues, Cysl8, Cys23 and Cys74, form a cluster in the N-terminal domain. The high-resolution d a t a from relatively aged crystals suggest t h a t a disulphide bond exists between Cysl8 and t Present address: Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md 20205, U.S.A. 0022-2836/83/290175-28 $03.00/0 175 O 1983 Academic Press Inc.

1. I n t r o d u c t i o n

The major components of mammalian eye lenses, the a-, fl- and v-crystallins (Harding & Dilley, 1976), exist in the relatively dehydrated medium of the enucleated lens fibre cells. Since there is little or no protein turnover in the longlived cells comprising the central parts of the lens (Wannemacher & Spector, 1968), it is important for the crystallins to possess great stability, both in their individual tertiary structures and also in their interactions with other cell components. These interactions are critically important for the maintenance of the optical properties of the transparent lens. In this context it is interesting to observe that the fl- and v-crystallins are rich in cysteine and aromatic residues (Croft, 1972; Van Dam, 1966; Driessen et al,, 1981) which are particularly vulnerable to oxidation. Indeed, disulphide and other cross-links, higher oxidation states of sulphur and unusual chromophores have all been detected in lenses afflicted with various forms of nuclear cataract (for reviews see Harding & Dilley, 1976; Augusteyn, 1981). In mammals, v-crystallin is localized in the lens core region (Papaconstantinou, 1965; Slingsby & Croft, 1973) where many senile and brunescent cataracts are initiated (Borkman et al., 1981). Furthermore, v-crystallin has been identified in cross-linked aggregates with other lens components in cataractous human lenses (Garner et al., 1981). The complete sequence of bovine V-II crystallin was reported by Croft (1972) and partial sequences of V-III and y-IV by Slingsby & Croft (1978). More recently, N-terminal sequences of four murine y-crystallins have been reported by Shinohara et al. (1982) and the complementary DNA sequences of two rat v-crystallins (Moormann et al., 1982) and a clone corresponding to 120 amino acids of a frog v-crystallin have been completed (Tomarev et al., 1982). These studies show that the v-erystallins are an homologous group of monomeric proteins comprising about 170 amino acids. Sequence studies on the oligomeric fl-crystallins of bovine (Driessen et al., 1981) and murine (Inana et al., 1982) lenses have shown further homologies indicating that the fl- and y-crystallins form a single protein superfamily, accounting for most of the protein in mammalian lenses (Wistow et al., 1981). Crystals of v-crystallins suitable for X-ray analysis have been produced by two groups (Carlisle et al., 1977; Blundell et al., 1978; Chirgadze et al., 1977). This has led to low-resolution (Blundell et al., 1978) and medium-resolution (Blundell et al., 1981) structural analyses of calf y-II crystallin. Low-resolution studies of calf y-II crystallin (Chirgadze et al., 1980) and IIIb (Chirgadze et al., 1981) have also been reported and the analyses of calf v-IV and the related bovine flBp-crystallin are under way (Slingsby et al., 1982). We now report a high-resolution model of V-II, the result of phase extension, model building and refinement to a resolution of 1.9 A, which indicates an amino acid sequence differing from that presented by Croft (1972).

50-s counting time including background were analysed using a moving-window technique (Tickle, 1975) to obtain the net integrated intensity. Two equivalents (hkl and kid) for the native and 4 equivalents (hkl, khl, hk/-and khl-) for the derivatives were measured so that 2 estimates of the anomalous difference of each reflection for the derivatives were obtained. Empirical absorption corrections were applied using a modification of the method of North et al. (1968) and radiation decay was monitored by standard reflections measured every hour. Data were collected for the uranyl acetate (4.5 A resolution), ethyl mercury chloride (3'4 h), potassium auricyanide (2.4 A), thiomersal (2.4 A) and hexachloroiridate IV (2"8 A) derivatives. Native (cross-linked) data were collected to a maximum resolution of 1-9 A. Intensities for different crystals of the same derivative were scaled together using the method of Hamilton et al. (1965) giving satisfactory merging R-factors. An absolute scale was applied by relative Wilson scaling (Wilson, 1949) followed by Fe/FeH scaling in resolution shells (see Blundell & Johnson, 1976). Patterson syntheses were calculated with coefficients F~LE and used to identify heavyatom binding positions for the ethyl mercury chloride, KAu(CN)2 and thiomersal derivatives at 5.5 A resolution, following which the uranyl acetate sites were tbund by difference Fourier synthesis as described by Blundell et al. (1978). The correct space group enantiomer (P41212) was determined by difference Fourier synthesis using cross-phases, including the contribution from anomalous differences at 5-5 A resolution. The heavy-atom parameters were eventually refined to the appropriate maximum resolutions using conventional full-matrix least-squares FHLE refinement. All data were included to 3-4 A (including anomalous contributions, although these proved to be insignificant at this resolution). From 3-4 A to 2.4 A centric data only were used in the refinement. Phases were calculated by the method of Blow & Crick (1959) and electron density maps were calculated using the fast Fourier transform program. A maximum multiple isomorphous replacement resolution of 2.6 A (figure of merit 68.5°/o) was chosen after inspection of the maps at different resolutions. The major derivatives shared common binding sites (Table l); this precluded refinement by the lack of closure method (Dickerson et al., 1967,1968), and gave poor phasing at the higher resolution ranges. Phases were improved by addition of data for the hexachloroiridate IV derivative. Patterson and difference Fourier syntheses at 4.5 A resolution indicated the presence of 2 sites, different from those of the mercury and gold derivatives. Data were collected to 2-8 A resolution using 6 crystals and a third site, fairly close to one mercury/gold site, was identified. The new data were refined using FHL~ as coefficients in 8 shells, with all data up to 3-3 A and centrie data only between 3-3 A and 2.8 A resolution. All 8 shells were included in the phasing, effectively as separate derivatives, due to occupancies varying from sheil to shell as is often found when the derivatives are formed from heavy-atom complexes or involve movement of protein ligands (see Table l). This increased the figure of merit at 2.6 A (phases calculated from all data) to 70.05°/o. To facilitate phase improvement, the Hendrickson & Lattman (1970) method was used for phase calculation. The phasing statistics are given in Table 2. (c) Electron density maps With the best phases calculated from m.i.r.t, electron density maps using terms weighted by the figure of merit were calculated for the data before and after inclusion of the hexachloroiridate (IV) contribution. At various stages maps were calculated which used phases resulting from the combination of Hendriekson & Lattman (1970) phase probability coefficients for m.i.r, data with those calculated from the protein model. This was accompanied by calculation of a Sire-weighting (Sim, 1959,1960) for the structure factor amplitude based on the observed and calculated values. During refinement, structure factor amplitudes of the form 2Fo-F¢ were used (Huber et al., 1974; Main, 1979; Vijayan, Abbreviations used: m.i.r., multiple isomorphous replacement; r.m.s., root-mean-square.

T o r e m o v e model-bias in difficult regions, a t o m s were r e m o v e d from the model before calculation of F¢ and ct~. On one occasion such o m i t maps were calculated by leaving out consecutive eighths of the model; otherwise particular a t o m s were chosen for omission. (d) Model building and electron density maps At 3.4 A and later 2.6 A resolution, mini-maps (3 cm = l A) were used to trace the p o l y p e p t i d e backbone. T h e 2-6 A m.i.r, m a p was transferred to large sheets a t 1-25 cm = l A in an optical c o m p a r a t o r (Richards, 1968) and a " K e n d r e w - t y p e " model was built. The positions of Ca, Cfl, O and some side-chains were measured. Model building was then carried o u t using the i n t e r a c t i v e c o m p u t e r graphics p r o g r a m F R O D O (Jones, t978) i m p l e m e n t e d for the E v a n s and S u t h e r l a n d Picture S y s t e m I I by A. J o n e s and modified by I. J. Tickle. The program allows the simultaneous display of 2 display objects. T y p i c a l l y one object consisted of the electron density m a p contoured on a course grid (with a spacing equal to half the resolution) and the o t h e r was used to display atomic co-ordinates. Realt i m e rotations of both objects on screen axes and m a n i p u l a t i o n of f r a g m e n t s of the model were easily achieved using pen and t a b l e t control, selecting p r o g r a m routines from 2 screen menus while o t h e r options, including sequence modification and regularization of model g e o m e t r y by the m e t h o d of H e r m a n s & McQueen (1974) were i m p l e m e n t e d by k e y b o a r d input. Various modifications i m p l e m e n t e d by I. J. Tickle increased the ease of operation and effectiveness of the program. Making rotations relative to screen axes was the first of these. L a t e r the n u m b e r of distances and angles displayed was increased and the continual u p d a t e of both these and also of nearest-neighbour c o n t a c t s during real-time m a n i p u l a t i o n of model f r a g m e n t s was p r o g r a m m e d .

protein molecule. The function minimized was of the form:

M = ~ Wf(Fo-GF¢)2+ ~. Wd(dt-dc) 2,
where G is a scale factor, Wf and Wd are weights referred to below, F o and F¢ are observed and calculated structure amplitudes and dt and d c are target and calculated distances between.atoms which are bonded and between atoms separated by a bond angle. Close nonbonded contacts were repelled by the inclusion of e x t r a terms in the function M. Refinement cycles were carried out on the AST000 (earlier on an IBM 370/165) and progress was monitored by calculation of:

The r.m.s, atomic shift after each cycle was calculated using structure amplitudes weighted with the Cruiekshank (1949) function:

(2)

The weights of the distance restraints a t the end of the refinement were adjusted such t h a t the r.m.s, deviation from target values was 0.02 A. (f) Comparison of co-ordinate sets Visual comparison of the Ca positions of the Greek key motifs of ~-II was performed using the interactive computer graphics program F I T Z (Taylor, 1983) in which 2 objects were overlapped for best fit. Quantitative comparisons were calculated using the E Z I F I T routines of McLachlan (1979). E U L E R (a similar program to E Z I F I T ) was used to perform a least-squares best fit of model co-ordinates from different steps of the refinement and model building process and to give a r.m.s, separation for equivalent atoms. (g) Progress of structure refinement The improvement of the structure was carried out in 7 steps each involving cycles of restrained least-squares followed by manual intervention including revision of the sequence, addition of water molecules and remodelling the structure. The progress of the least-squares refinement is summarized in Fig. 1. Details of the first cycles of refinement in step 1 are omitted as these were exploratory and involved experimentation with the weights for distance restraints and with the resolution. Step 1 led to an agreement value of 27.8% with all reflections included but although this is comparable with the value obtained at the end of step 2, there was a 0.83 A r.m.s. difference between the 2 co-ordinate sets. This emphasizes the dangers of the use of agreement residuals alone as criteria for improvement of structure during refinement. A much more meaningful test at intermediate resolution is the reasonableness of non-bonded contacts and the existence of new information in the electron density maps based on the refined co-ordinate sets. Individual therma! parameters were used in the later cycles of steps 5 to 7. Restraints on distances were relaxed in the first cycles of several steps in order to increase the radius of convergence. In the first steps phase information from the refined co-ordinates was combined with t h a t from isomorphous replacement b u t after step 5 the calculated phases alone were used. This led to a considerable improvement in the electron density close to the heavy-atom sites. Omit maps were found to be particularly useful in step 4. Care was taken in the reinterpretation of the electron density maps as it was evident t h a t the published sequence of Croft (1972) was incorrect. Insertions, deletions and replacements were made to optimize the fit of the model to the electron density.

sequences of peptide fragments and to the total protein amino acid composition (Croft, 1972), and the relationship of sequences of structurally similar regions within the molecule and with homologous fl,7-crystallins were all taken into account. We were very cautious in the introduction of water molecules in view of the ambiguity of sequence. 22 water molecules were included after step 2 and only 100 water molecules were included in the final cycles of refinement. The improvement of the electron density during the early cycles of refinement is illustrated in Fig. 2 showing typically small reorientations of main-chain and side groups which usually required manual intervention using the interactive computer graphics. Figure 3 shows the electron density in the region of Cysl8 and Cys23 which indicates that these cysteine residues have oxidized and formed a disulphide bridge. This was included as a distance restraint in the final steps of the refinement. Figure 4 shows some examples of the electron density after step 7 of the refinement procedure.

The new sequence shows increased homology with recently determined sequences of fl,?-crystallins, and also shows an increased internal homology between residues at topologically equivalent positions in the four similar "Greek k e y " motifs as is also shown in Table 4. Certain residues are particularly difficult to identify with certainty. T h e y include Va139, Phe43A, Met48A, Gln51A, His53 and I t e l l 9 B .

There is evidence for static disorder in the side-chain of Arg56 and the C-terminal tripeptide occupies weak electron density presumably due to chain flexibility. Although the disulphide Cys18--Cys23 is well defined by the electron density, the bond length tends to be too long at 2.4 A possibly indicating static disorder due to partial oxidation.

(b) The hierarchical organization of the structure Figure 5 shows that the ~-crystallin molecule comprises two globular domains, each constructed from two Greek key motifs (Richardson, 1977). The four motifs which occur consecutively along the polypeptide chain are numbered 1 to 4. Intra-domain dyads relate motifs 1 to 2, and 3 to 4 with r.m.s, deviations shown in Table 4. The similarity of the domains is indicated in Figure 6 which superposes topologically equivalent residues. The best agreements are between motifs 1 and 3 and motifs 2 and 4. The two intra-domain pseudo-dyads make an angle of 40 ° and are bisected by the pseudo-dyad relating the two domains. Tables 3 and 4 also show the identify of amino acid residues at topologically equivalent positions in the Greek key motifs. The homology is highest in the region of the folded hairpin structure formed by strands a and b of each Greek key motif as shown in Figure 7. The conservation of the glycines homologous to 13 is clearly required by the unusual ¢ angle (always positive) as shown in Table 3. Residues topologically equivalent to P h e l l and Tyr6 are always aromatic and pack together in the folded structure as shown in Figure 8. The conserved serine side-chains (homologous to 34) are buried and form hydrogen bonds between their 0~ and the peptide nitrogen of the residues homologous to P h e l l . Residues topologically equivalent to Arg36 wrap across Tyr6 and P h e l l , leading to interactions between the aromatic phenyl ring of residue l l and the planar uorbital delocalized guanidinium moiety. The close sequence homologies and structural relationships between motifs 1 and 3 and motifs 2 and 4 compared to the intra-domain motifs are consistent with divergent evolution involving an ancestral protein similar to one domain as an intermediate stage in evolution. (c) Secondary structure The torsion angles (¢, ~h) for topologically equivalent residues are given in Table 3 which shows that the four Greek key motifs are remarkably similar. For example, residues equivalent to Glu7 all have right-handed a-helical

conformations, which allow the hairpin loop between strands a and b to be folded back onto the sheet. Of the four antiparallel fl-strands of each Greek key, strand a has ~, ~b values of -123(16) ° and 139(12) ° close to the typical values described by Chothia (1973). The first residue of strand b has collagen-like ~b, ~h angles ( - 6 7 °, 142°), while those of the following four are closer to fl-sheet with ~, ~ of - 119 °, 134 °.

Tyr6 and Ser34 are buried. Other motifs are similar. left-handed helical conformation in motifs 2, 3 and 4. Schellman (1980) has noted t h a t a-helices in m a n y proteins terminate in this way, the residues most commonly involved being glycine, asparagine and lysine. After a rather irregular conformation the polypeptide forms a final fl-strand, d, in each motif which has a fl-bulge involving an e x t r a residue in motifs 2 and 4. Circular dichroism studies (Horwitz, 1976; Zigler et al., 1980) have indicated t h a t ~-crystallins contain less than 50~+o fl-sheet and little a-helix. This m a y be explained by the relatively few residues which are in fl-sheet conformation as part of extended chains. The a-helical regions are of a rather irregular nature and p a r t of their contribution to the circular dichroism m a y be cancelled by the existence of some residues in conformations characteristic of left-handed helices. Each domain comprises two right-handed twisted sheets made up of three strands (a, b, d) of one motif and one strand (c') of the other motif in the same domain. The hydrogen bonding in the four sheets is illustrated in Figure 9. Five hydrogen bonds between strands b and a, four between a and d and two between d and c' are common to all four sheets. One of the conserved b - - a hydrogen bonds is made between the first residue of strand b (residue 14 of motif l) to the nitrogen atom of the residue (7 in motif 1) which has ¢, ~h angles of an a-helix allowing the hairpin into a position folded onto the sheet. Sheets 1 and 3 both have bifurcated hydrogen bonds in equivalent positions: 0 2 (the carbonyl oxygen of residue 2) can hydrogen bond to both N38 and N39, while 0 8 5 hydrogen bonds with N121 and N122. There are several structurally i m p o r t a n t hydrogen bonds outside the sheets. Of particular significance are the hydrogen bonds between atoms equivalent to O12 and N8 which hold together the two antiparallel strands of the folded hairpin. In

In the same region there is a further conserved hydrogen bond between the first of the residues in the left-handed helical conformation (Glyl0 and equivalent residues) which has a hydrogen bond from its nitrogen to the oxygen on strand c' (Pro60 and equivalents). This well-defined bond (mean distance 2-7/k) pins the folded hairpin onto the sheet, to the c' strand contributed by the other Greek key motif of the domain. In the loosely helical segments connecting strands c and d of each motif there are two (motifs 1 and 3) or three (motifs 2 and 4) hydrogen bonds. Each domain has two further conserved hydrogen bonds. One links the two motifs such that the oxygens of Asp69 and Ala153, respectively, bond to nitrogens of Cys32 and Vail 17, residues which protrude down into the core from the loop leading to strand d of motifs 1 and 3.

residue preceding strand d in motifs 2 and 4 (Arg72, Glyl56) to the core leucine residues of motifs 1 and 3 (Leu26A, Leul08). (d) Tertiary structure The two sheets of each domain are packed together as a wedge-shaped sandwich with an angle of 35 ° between the sheets. The strands of one sheet make an angle of 20 ° when projected onto the other sheet within a domain. There is a similar relationship between the two sheets which provide the contacts between the domains in the whole molecule. Interactions of hydrophobic side groups of these sheets include interactions between sheets of the two domains, in addition to interactions between the sheets and the folded hairpin structures described above. (i) Intra-domain contacts In each domain the packing of hydrophobic side-chains of the two sheets is conserved, but although the domain is a pseudo-dimer, the two sheets contribute in slightly different ways. The core can be divided into three regions from the bottom angle of the wedge up to the top where the c-d loops close the wedge. At the angle of the wedge, space is filled almost entirely by a single side-chain, Trp42A/125 contributed by strand a of sheet 2 or 4. In the C-terminal domain, Phe84 also contributes, lying below Trpl25. The middle layer of core is a staggered bilayer of side-chains. Instead of a symmetrical packing of two rows of residues from one sheet onto two rows from the other, two rows from sheet 1(3) pack onto one row from sheet 2(4). A row consists of residues on adjacent strands (b, a. d, c') in a line perpendicular to the strand direction. In each row of four the outer residues are at the open face of the wedge while the inner pair are completely protected from solvent (Table 3) and are often isoleucine, leucine or valine. N-terminal domain: letters in parenthesis show to which strand of the appropriate sheet each residue belongs: Sheet I Sheet 2 Sheet 1 CyslS(b) Cys23(c') Tyrl6(b) Ile3(a) Cys74(d) Phe5(a) Val37(d) Ile44A(a) Ile35(d) Gly57 (c') Leu55A(b) Tyr59(c')

The "missing" first row of sheet 2(4) is represented only by Trp42A (125) at the angle of the sheet. Leu55A (137) is almost in line with the t r y p t o p h a n residue, but its side-chain extends up into the row above, contacting residues 37, 44A and 35 (120, 125B and l l 9 B ) . The side-chains of T y r 5 4 B and T y r l 3 5 are similarly orientated " u p w a r d s " out of the bilayer, even though the a positions are close to this region. Apart from this distortion in strand b of sheet 2(4) the rows are quite linear.

?-II CRYSTALLIN AT 1.9A RESOLUTION

195

The similarities in the arrangements are clear. The conservation of glycine at 57 and 140 and of tyrosine at 59 and 142 (in motifs 2 and 4) is explained as the large, aromatic side-chain points down to fill space left unoccupied by the glycine. The tyrosine also has a function in forming Part of the environment of a tryptophan residue in the next layer of core. Phe5 is "replaced" by the smaller Ile88 in the C-terminal domain, but this is compensated for by larger residues, Met86 and Leul58 taking the place of Ile3 and Cys74. This also means that a polarizable sulphur atom is retained in a similar position in both domains although it belongs to a residue in a different main-chain position. The widest part of the wedge is filled in a different way. Two residues protrude down into the core from the end of the connection between the c and d strands, Cys32 and Ile71 in the N-terminal domain and Valll7 and Vall55 in the C4erminal domain. The rest of the space is filled by residues on either side of the domain introducing into core from the direction of the solvent faces. From one side, the space is filled by residues from motif 1(3), Leu26A (Leul08) and Phe29 (Phe112) with Tyr28 (Argl 1 l) protecting these from solvent. There are insertions ill motif 3 at His113 and Leu114 when compared with motif 1. These account for the small size of Ser99 compared to Tyrl6 in the middle layer. From the other side, contributed by motifs 2(4), Trp64 (Trpl48) is central and protected from the solvent by Tyr54B (Tyrl35) and to a lesser extent by Tyr59 (Tyr142) of the middle layer of core residues. (ii) The inter-domain contact Although the side-chains involved in the interactions within the domains do not have truly symmetrical packing, the contacts between domains have a symmetry axis closer to a true 2-fold. Four hydrophobic residues form the heart of the contact. Phe43A and Phe54C of motif 2 pack onto Leul36 and Vall25A of motif 4 (note that only one of these residues is the same as in the Croft (1972) sequence). The solvent accessibility of the equivalent residues Phe43A and Vall25A is zero while that of the other pair is higher (Table 3) due almost entirely to the solvation of the carbonyl oxygen atoms. This interpretation thus gives a double contact between an aromatic side-chain and a smaller, branched hydrophobic side-chain with a similar total volume for each contact. Symmetry is broken by having both aromatic side-chains on the same side. Other hydrophobic residues interact with the contact residues: Ile77 and Vall61 both contact Phe54C and Leul36 while Ile77 alone touches Phe43A. The smaller Vall25A appears to make no other contacts with hydrophobic residues. Otherwise, the contact region is surrounded by hydrophilic side-chains, interacting via their aliphatic or aromatic moieties while polar groups are exposed to solvent.

(e) The location of the tryptophan residues
The four tryptophan residues of ~-II have important structural roles in both domains and are essentially completely shielded from solvent (Table 3). However, each indole ring contains a nitrogen atom (NE1 in Brookhaven nomenclature)

19(i

G. WISTOW ET AL.

which is capable of hydrogen bonding, and it would be most unfavourable energetically to bury this atom in a hydrophobic environment. In fact for the topologically equivalent Trp42A and Trpl25 the side-chains hydrogen bond to main-chain peptide oxygen atoms of 39 and 122 (also equivalent residues). On the other hand there is no protein atom close to the NE1 atom of Trp64 and Trpl48 which are also topologically equivalent. The electron density indicates that these hydrogen bonding positions are occupied by water molecules which are also bound to two carbonyls (068 and 070 for Trp64 and 0152 and 0154 for Trpl48). (f) The molecular surface Although the surface is largely polar and hydrophilic, many side-chains are well-ordered and appear to be organized into pairs or chains of ionic and/or polar interactions which may contribute to the structural stability of the molecule. For example, Glu7 and Asp8 have their side-chains lying on either side of the basic guanidinium group of Arg31 at the beginning of strand d. Similarly, Glull6 is bracketed by Asnll8 and Asnl52 while Glu122, Arg85, Glul00 and Arg87 form a chain of ionic interactions. The most extensive network of charged groups is centred on Asp92 and includes a series of six alternating positively and negatively charged side-chains in one molecule. However, the network does not end there; Argl44 is close to Aspl03 of a symmetry-related molecule at a crystal lattice point so that the ionic interactions can connect ne!ghbouring molecules. Nearby, Glu90 and Arg91 (topologically equivalent to residues 7 and 8 in motif 1), adjacent to Asp92, but probably not linked ionically, form an ion-pair with their symmetry-related opposites across a 2-fold axis on a third molecule in the lattice. It is noticeable that the C-terminal domain has a greater preponderance of acidic and basic groups (which might be expected to be charged) than does the N-terminal domain. The charges are balanced within each domain and over 500/0 of the ionic side-chains form ion pairs. The networks or polar side-chains may form an "exoskeleton", adding to the stability of the ~-II molecule in the same way that the abundant ion pairs on the surfaces of enzymes from thermophilic bacteria contribute to thermal stability (Walker et al., 1980). Another possibility is that the organized charges, partially neutralized and with their bonding requirements satisfied without the need for solvent molecules, form a surface which, while remaining polar and therefore water-soluble, has a reduced tendency to bind and order water and a low solvation potential. Several hydrophobic side-chains are at least partly exposed to solvent (Table 3). Many of these are polarizable aromatic groups or sulphurcontaining residues, but a few are purely non-polar, e.g. Leu76, L e u l l 4 and Leul21. All of the proline side-chains and the glycines at 13 and 82 are at bends at the surface and therefore relatively accessible to solvent. (g) Lattice contacts Since the protein concentration in the lens core region may approach that of the crystal (approx. 62% wet weight) the kind of intermolecular contacts observed in

the crystal m a y be similar to those in the lens. Seven major sites have been identified and the contacts are listed in Table 5. Most of the contacts are polar. Few of the interactions are purely hydrophobic (but see Fig. 10(a)) although the frequent occurrence of interactions between delocalized guanidinium, sulphur groups and aromatic groups m a y be mainly hydrophobic. As the ~-II crystallin has so m a n y of these residues they may well play an i m p o r t a n t role in protein interactions in the lens. The close positioning of the two terminal tyrosine residues shows t h a t an intermolecular cross-link could easily form (Fig. 10(b)). Such an interaction would be consistent with the work of Buckingham (1972) who showed t h a t ultraviolet light induces cross-linking of bovine ~-crystallin and t h a t of Garcia-Castineiras et al. (1978) who detected bityrosine in lenses. (h) Sulphur atoms and polarizable groups Although cysteine and methionine residues are not evenly distributed through the molecule there is a fairly even distribution of sulphur atoms. The N-terminal domain has six cysteine and two methionine residues while the C-terminal domain has one cysteine and five methionine residues. An intracellular protein of the size of ~-crystallin would be expected to have a b o u t two cysteines only (Fahey et al., 1977). Sulphur is a highly polarizable atom and m a y play a role in the

stabilization of the molecular core and also serve to protect ultraviolet-sensitive aromatic side-chains from photo-oxidation. Chains of alternating aromatic and sulphur-containing residues have been observed in several protein structures (Morgan et al., 1978). It has also been suggested that such interactions between polarizable moieties may contribute strongly to protein stability (Bodner et al., 1977). The extended molecular orbitals formed by such structures may facilitate electron flow in cytochromes and other electron transfer proteins; such mechanisms could also protect internal aromatic residues from the effects of ultraviolet irradiation (see Bent & Hayon, 1975; Arian et al., 1970). Arginine, another residue with a polarizable u-orbital system, has also been observed in interactions with aromatic and sulphur-containing residues (Morgan & McAdon, 1980). This is reminiscent of the folded hairpin structures involving as it does two aromatic residues and an arginine. In fact all sulphur atoms are found to be near other sulphurs, aromatics or

arginines in 7-II crystallin. In the N-terminal domain the buried tryptophan residues are associated with the two buried cysteine residues. Cys32 has Trp64 and Phe29 on either side with Phe5 "below". Cys74 is in contact with Trp42A and also Phe5. CysT4 is also very close to both Cysl8 and Cys23 which in the highresolution map appear to be linked by a disulphide bond (Fig. 3). Cysl8 is also in contact with T y r l 6 and Phe5. Thus, an extended molecular orbital covering Tyrl6, Cys] 8-Cys23, Phe5, CysT4, Trp42A, Cys32, Trp64 and Phe29, branched at Phe5, could easily be envisaged. Cysteine at 41A near the inter-domain contact, would not be involved in such interactions. This might give the N-terminal domain the extra stability relative to the C-terminal domain, that it otherwise lacks because of a paucity of surface charges. Met65 is close to Gln134, which reaches across from its position near the inter-domain contact, but is otherwise exposed to solvent. Cysl5 is on the solvent side of Tyr6, the conserved core residue of the folded hairpin structure of motif l, so it is possible that, in solution, the sulphur atom may instead interact with the ring. In the equivalent position in motif 3, Met98 also lies alongside a tyrosine. In the C-terminal domain only one of the sulphur atoms is substantially buried. Met86 has a negligible solvent-accessible area and lies in close contact with Trp125, so that although in a different main-chain position this residue can play a

similar role to Cys74 in the N-terminal domain. The other methionine sulphur atoms are exposed to solvent. Metl27 is close to two basic residues, Lysl54 and Argl31. Metl51 is near Tyrl45 and Metl62 is close to Argl60, Phe84 and Arg*95¢, Another methionine near a lattice contact is Met98, close to both Arg87 and Tyr89 and also to Met*98. Lastly, Cysl05, with very little solvent-accessible surface area although positioned at the solvent face of the domain wedge, is in contact with Phe112 and Argl I I. Ill the 2.6 A map (Blundell et al., 1981 ), the disulphide bond between Cysl8 and Cys23 was not unambiguously shown. Undoubtedly this was due in large measure to distortions in the local electron density caused by nearby heavy-atom binding sites. With increasing resolution and with phasing independent of the m.i.r, data the electron density improved and the distinct, separate peak formerly occupied by the side-chain of Cys23 disappeared. The simplest explanation, therefore, is that the m.i.r, data were in error in this region. However, it may be that in the lower-resolution study fresh crystals exposed to oxidizing conditions for shorter periods did not possess the disulphide bond in all molecules, leading to static disorder in the crystal and hence to a confused map. Higher-resolution data were collected from older crystals which had been subjected to longer exposures which therefore might have been more completely oxidized. This would imply that in vivo Cys23 is more exposed adopting the position originally allotted to it in the 2.6 A map. It can be seen that even in the disulphide, Cys23 is considerably more exposed than is Cysl8 (Table 3). BjSrk (1964) and Croft (1972) both suggested that the cysteine residues of ~-crystallins are probably significant for structure or function, and the work described here has shown that the sulphur atoms of ~-II are involved in interactions which stabilize intra- and intermolecular contacts as well as acting to protect aromatic residues from photo-oxidation. There may be a further role for sulphur specifically in ~-II which has a cluster of three cysteine residues (18, 23 and 74) and in the crystal has a disulphide bond between Cysl8 and Cys23, whereas other calf ~ fractions lack Cys23 (Slingsby & Croft, 1978). Furthermore, it is possible that the bond does not exist in the native, reduced protein. Since this internal disulphide can be accommodated in ~-II without disruption of the structure, the protein could act as a sink for oxidizing potential in the core of the lens, effectively a reservoir of sulphydryl. Disulphides could accumulate harmlessly in ~-II rather than dangerously elsewhere. (i) The role of ~-crystallin in the transparent lens and in cataract ~-Crystallins in mammalian lenses are essentially proteins of early development, found predominantly in the high protein concentration regions of the central part of the lens. The structure of ~-II presented here has several sites for non-covalent interaction with other crystallins but probably has a low tendency to bind water, since much of the ionic and polar bonding potential of the surface is accounted for in intramolecular interactions. This would suit ~-crystallin for the dehydrated medium of the lens where it may further serve to stabilize the larger a and Residues depicted with an asterisk precedingthe number denotes a residue in a symmetry-related molecule.

fl-crystallin aggregates, particularly in the lens core region. Alteration of the surface properties of 7-crystallin might then be expected to lead to a catastrophic super-aggregate of crystallin causing light scatter leading to opacity (Benedek, 1971). Surface modification of 7-crystallin resulting in non-covalent aggregation could then be followed or associated with chemical cross-linking with other crystallin molecules or with cell membranes (Garner et al., 1981). From what is known of the structure it is improbable t h a t the inaccessible Cys32 and Cys74 would ever become sufficiently exposed for intermolecular reaction except under the most extreme conditions. I f the oxidation state of the lens rose, Cysl8 and Cys23 would almost certainly be involved in an intramolecular bond. However, calf ~-II has one highly exposed sulphydryl at Cysl5 and thus it would seem likely t h a t this residue is involved in intermolecular disulphide cross-linking. We gratefully acknowledge the technical support of many of our colleagues in the Birkbeck Crystallography Department for maintaining apparatus necessary for the X-ray diffraction experiments. This work would not have been possible without the financial support of the Medical Research Council, London.
