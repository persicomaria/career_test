1. Introduction Steroid receptor mediated gene activation is crucial for cellular processes involved in proliferation, differentiation, development and homeostasis. Steroid receptors form a subfamily within a larger group of nuclear receptors that require ligand binding for induction of transcriptional activation [1]. Active transcription initiation complexes include associated coactivators and factors of the transcriptional machinery. Steroid receptors have a modular structure that includes a carboxylterminal ligand binding domain (LBD), a central DNA binding domain, and an NH2 -terminal transcriptional activation region [2]. Characteristic features of steroid receptors are activation function 1 (AF1) in the NH2 terminal domain and activation function 2 (AF2) in the LBD. The importance of these activation regions differs among the receptors. The essential role of the androgen receptor (AR) in male sex differentiation is well established. Naturally occurring mutations in the AR result in the androgen insensitivity syndrome which is characterized by a phenotypic spectrum of incomplete male sexual development in utero [3]. Phenotypic abnormalities in male sex development reflect structural and functional abnormalities in the AR. The AR gene localizes to the X chromosome (Xq11-q12) [4] and thus males express a single allele. Mutations in the AR gene cause absent or incomplete masculinization in 46,XY genetic males. Clinical features of complete androgen insensitivity include an external female phenotype in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype, undescended intra-abdominal testes

that lack spermatogenesis, absence of development of Mllerian and Wolffian structures, normal to elevated u male levels of circulating testosterone and estradiol, lack of axillary and pubic hair, and normal female breast development at puberty [3]. Partial androgen insensitivity presents as a range of phenotypes varying between normal male and female external genitalia with pubic hair. Androgen insensitivity is also recognized as the cause of milder forms of under-virilization in males associated with infertility [5,6]. Severity of an AR gene defect during male development reflects the importance of that amino acid in AR function. The majority of AR gene mutations are single base missense mutations in the DNA binding domain (exons 2­3) or carboxyl-terminal region (exons 4­8) with more than 100 unique mutations reported [7]. Partial or complete loss of AR function results from the disruption of any one of a number of functional properties of the AR, including high affinity androgen binding, DNA binding and AR stability. Mutations causing partial androgen insensitivity have less severe effects on AR function [8­11]. Recently reported studies on genital skin fibroblasts from androgen insensitivity subjects in whom no AR gene mutation was detected raise the possibility that androgen insensitivity also results from defects in AR coactivators [12]. 1.1. p160 coactivators in AR mediated gene activation Hormone regulated gene transcription involves the recruitment of active transcription initiation complexes composed of steroid receptors and coactivators [13,14]. Coactivators serve as modifiers of chromatin and adapter molecules between the nuclear receptors and general transcriptional machinery. Recent studies have focused on p160 coactivators that have, or recruit,

histone acetyltransferase activity. These include steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) [15], transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) [16], and amplified in breast cancer-1 (AIB1) which is in a group of related SRC3 coactivators [14,17]. Additional proteins such as CBP/p300 and p/CAF with histone acetyltransferase activity associate with the p160 coactivators, resulting in histone modification and chromatin remodeling [18,19] and the formation of transcriptionally competent TRAP/DRIP complexes [20]. Nuclear receptors appear to interact rapidly with p160 coactivators, followed by a slower interaction with the TRAP/DRIP components [21,22]. For instance, SRC1 and RAC3/SRC3 associate with the progesterone receptor in high molecular weight complexes [23]. Transcriptional activation domains in steroid receptors mediate interactions with coactivators. This includes AF1 in the NH2 -terminal domain and AF2 in the LBD. Similarly, p160 coactivators contain distinct nuclear receptor interaction domains in the central and carboxyl-terminal regions [16,24]. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated a functional link between AF2 activity in the LBD of steroid receptors and the binding of p160 coactivators [25,26]. p160 coactivators interact with the AF2 hydrophobic surface in the LBD through conserved amphipathic alpha helical LXXLL motifs, where L is leucine and X is any amino acid [27,28]. Cocrystal structures of nuclear receptor LBDs and LXXLL motif fragments confirm the AF2 and p160 coactivator interaction through the LXXLL motifs [26,29­31]. One of the coactivator genes, AIB1, is amplified in breast cancer [32], whereas the levels of SRC1 and TIF2 proteins are increased in recurrent prostate cancer [33]. In transient cotransfection studies, p160 coactivators increase steroid receptor transcriptional activity. However, it has been more difficult to establish whether these coactivators are required for nuclear receptor activity in vivo. Inactivation of the SRC1 gene by gene targeting resulted in viable and fertile homozygous mice but with decreased growth of the uterus, prostate, testis and mammary glands [34]. Loss of SRC1 coactivator function therefore results in only partial resistance to reproductive hormones. It is possible that SRC1 activity was compensated by increased expression of TIF2 [34]. SRC1 homozygous knockout mice were resistant to thyroid hormone providing in vivo evidence for a link between SRC1 and the thyroid hormone receptor [35]. The SRC-3 gene codes for the third member of the p160 coactivators, which is differentially expressed most likely due to alternative mRNA splicing. SRC3 homozygous knockout mice exhibit delayed growth and puberty, reduced female reproductive function, and reduced mammary gland development [36]. Delayed growth but no delay in puberty resulted from knocking out the p/CIP gene (SRC3) [37]. In both studies, inhibition of growth in the male and female was associated

with inhibition of IGF-1 gene expression [36,37]. SRC-3 (p/CIP/RAC3/AIB1/ACTR/TRAM-1) therefore has a role in regulating somatic growth, but it remains to be unequivocally demonstrated whether the p160 family of coactivators is required for AR function in vivo.

2. The AR NH2 - and carboxyl-terminal interaction A unique property of the AR is the N/C interaction, which is an androgen-induced interaction between the NH2 -terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminal LBD [38,39]. The N/C interaction requires the binding of agonists that have androgen activity in vivo. The high affinity natural androgens, dihydrotestosterone and testosterone, and the synthetic agonists, mibolerone and methyltrienolone (R1881) at concentrations of 0.1­1 nM, induce the N/C interaction in mammalian two hybrid assays [40]. Lower affinity anabolic steroids also induce the N/C interaction, but no interaction is seen in the presence of other steroids such as estradiol or progesterone, or by the AR antagonists hydroxyflutamide, cyproterone acetate and RU56187. AR antagonists inhibit the dihydrotestosterone-induced N/C interaction. Evidence for an agonist-induced N/C interaction has been confirmed by a number of laboratories for the AR [41­47] and for other steroid receptors [48­51]. 2.1. Role of AF2 in the N/C interaction Steroid receptors interact with coactivators during the recruitment of active transcription initiation complexes required for hormone regulated gene transcription. Transcriptional activation domains in steroid receptors that mediate these interactions include AF1 in the NH2 -terminal domain and AF2 in the LBD. AF2 is required for estrogen receptor activity [52] whereas the AR depends predominantly on AF1 [53]. AF2 in AR is weak due to its reduced ability to recruit p160 coactivators through binding of the LXXLL motifs [54]. However, certain AR mutations in the AF2 region of the AR LBD cause androgen insensitivity without altering the apparent equilibrium androgen binding affinity, suggesting that an important AR function is disrupted. Analysis of mutations in AF2 of the AR LBD that cause partial or complete androgen insensitivity revealed that the AF2 binding surface functions primarily as the N/C interaction site for the AR NH2 -terminal domain [54]. The results suggested that the N/C interaction is required for AR activity in vivo. Experiments utilizing two hybrid and GST affinity matrix assays indicated that the N/C interaction is required to stabilize helix 12 that makes up part of AF2. The N/C interaction slows the dissociation rate of AR-bound androgen [39,55,56]

which may be critical for maintaining AR activity in the nucleus. AR may recruit p160 coactivators such as SRC1 and TIF2 through its NH2 -terminal and DNA binding domains in an LXXLL motif-independent manner. However, it is not clear to what extent this interaction increases transactivation in vivo. The results indicate a novel function for AF2 in AR and a unique mechanism of nuclear receptor transactivation.

3. FXXLF in the AR NH2 -terminal region mediates the androgen dependent interaction with AF2 in the ligand binding domain The multiple LXXLL signature motifs that characterize nuclear receptor p160 coactivators [27] mediate binding to AF2 of the nuclear receptor LBD [16,26, 27,29,57,58]. Recent cocrystal structures of nuclear receptor LBDs and LXXLL motif fragments support that AF2 of many nuclear receptors recruits TIF2 and SRC1 through their LXXLL motifs. The AF2 region of steroid receptors forms a hydrophobic cleft that binds the amphipathic alpha helix formed by the LXXLL motif of p160 coactivators. Previous studies on the estrogen receptor showed that LXXLL-containing peptides with sequences derived from p160 coactivators and from phage display libraries inhibit estradiol-induced estrogen receptor a and b mediated reporter gene expression [59,60]. Competition by LXXLL peptides that diminished transcriptional activity supported the requirement for 160 coactivators in estrogen receptor mediated transactivation [61]. Since AR AF2 mediated transcriptional activity is relatively weak and the AF2 region serves as a binding site for the N/C interaction, we investigated whether the AR NH2 -terminal region contains a similar LXXLL-like motif. Two motifs were identified: FXXLF at residues 23­27 (23 FQNLF27 ) and WXXLF at residues 433­437 (433 WHTLF437 ) [55], where F is phenylalanine and W is tryptophan. Studies on a series of NH2 -terminal domain mutants indicated that both motifs are required for the N/C interaction, but that FXXLF is the predominant interaction motif. Mutations introduced within the FXXLF and WXXLF motifs increased the dissociation rate of bound ½3 HR1881 by disrupting the N/C interaction. The glucocorticoid receptor appears to lack an N/C interaction and dexamethasone bound to the glucocorticoid receptor dissociates rapidly [40]. This is consistent with the higher concentrations of dexamethasone (10 nM) required for glucocorticoid receptor transactivation. When sequence coding for the LXXLL motif region of TIF2 was fused into the coding region of the glucocorticoid receptor NH2 -terminal domain to cause an artificial N/C interaction, the dissociation rate of ½3 Hdexamethasone slowed by 5-fold and was similar to the dissociation rate of ½3 HR1881 from the AR [56].

The result supports the hypothesis that the N/C interaction maintains AR activation at low circulating androgen concentrations by holding the ligand in the binding pocket. This could be especially important for normal masculinization of the male fetus in utero. AR AF2 appears to be the preferential interaction site for the FXXLF motif in the AR NH2 -terminal domain rather than for the LXXLL motifs of the p160 coactivators. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that the agonist-induced N/C interaction interferes with p160 coactivator recruitment by AF2 [56]. It is nevertheless conceivable that there is a competitive equilibrium for binding the AR FXXLF motif and the LXXLL motifs of p160 coactivators during transactivation. Overexpression of p160 coactivators such as TIF2 may shift this equilibrium to overcome the N/C interaction mediated inhibition of p160 coactivator recruitment. This is an intriguing possibility since we recently showed elevated levels of SRC1 and TIF2 protein expression in recurrent prostate cancer samples from androgen withdrawn patients [33]. Under normal physiological conditions, AF1 in the AR NH2 -terminal region appears to be the major transactivation function of the AR, but under conditions of high p160 coactivator expression such as those observed in recurrent prostate cancer, AF2 may increase the overall transcriptional capacity of the AR, leading to increased cell proliferation. A competition model for p160 coactivator binding was previously proposed for the estrogen receptor. In this case, competition for p160 coactivator binding to AF2 was by an LXXLL-like binding motif and resulted in transcriptional inhibition. The carboxyl-terminal region of the estrogen receptor contains an LXXML sequence in helix 12 [30]. In the presence of antagonist binding, LXXML interacts with AF2 to block p160 coactivator binding. The conformational change that occurs with antagonist binding interferes with estrogen receptor recruitment of p160 coactivators. In the AR it is an FXXLF motif in the NH2 -terminal sequence rather an LXXML motif in helix 12 that binds AF2 and this occurs in response to agonist rather than antagonist binding. Dihydrotestosterone binding and induction of the N/C interaction occupy AF2, thereby inhibiting access of p160 coactivators to AF2 and making AF1 the principal activation region. 3.1. The N/C interaction in AR stabilization Dihydrotestosterone and testosterone stabilize AR against degradation [62]. The vitamin D receptor is the only other nuclear receptor reported to be stabilized by agonist binding [63]. Thus agonist-induced receptor stabilization is not a general phenomenon of nuclear receptors. Instead the progesterone [64], estrogen [65,66], glucocorticoid [67] and thyroid hormone receptors [68] each undergo agonist-induced receptor degra-

dation. Dihydrotestosterone- and testosterone-induced AR stabilization results in part from the N/C interaction [38,39,69]. AR stabilization by agonist is observed in transient transfection assays [62] and in studies using cell lines endogenously expressing AR [70]. In contrast to the AR, mutation of certain amino acid residues in AF2 of the estrogen receptor stabilized the receptor against agonist-induced degradation [71]. On the other hand, the N/C interaction is induced by agonist binding and contributes to AR stabilization [39]. More recent studies in which we introduced mutations into the AR FXXLF motif provided further evidence that the N/C interaction stabilizes the AR against degradation [56]. In addition, creation of a TIF2-glucocorticoid receptor chimera indicated that an artificial N/C interaction reversed the destabilizing effect of dexamethasone on the glucocorticoid receptor [56]. 3.2. The FXX LF motif in AR coactivators A search of the amino acid sequences of three previously reported AR coactivators [72­75] revealed FXXLF motifs in ARA70, ARA54, and ARA55 [76]. Androgen dependent interaction of these motifs with the AR ligand binding domain was confirmed by peptide interaction [76] and mutagenesis studies [76,77]. The motifs were present in fragments previously selected in yeast two hybrid screens thus accounting for their isolation as AR coactivators. However, we observed only modest transcriptional effects of these proteins on AR activity in cotransfection assays when compared to controls not inhibited by the addition of empty vector DNA. The results raised the possibility that these proteins have functions that indirectly impact AR mediated transactivation. The presence of these FXXLF motifs and their specificity for the AR [76] suggest that the AR AF2 region may interact with other proteins in a temporal sequence through the same site as the N/C interaction as proposed for the p160 coactivators and TRAP/ DRIP complexes.

However, an intra-molecular N/C interaction within the monomer has not been ruled out. The N/C interaction protects the ligand in the binding pocket of the LBD and results in stabilization of the AR which may be required for AR mediated transactivation in vivo. Although inhibition by the N/C interaction of p160 coactivator recruitment to the AF2 region raises questions regarding the role of p160 coactivators in AR mediated gene transcription, there may be a temporal sequence of protein recruitment by AF2 during transactivation. Under conditions where p160 coactivators are overexpressed as in recurrent prostate cancer, enhanced AF2 activity may provide a mechanism to augment the activity of the AR and thereby promote cell proliferation.

4. Conclusion The molecular evidence thus far indicates that the agonist-induced N/C interaction is required for AR function in vivo. Induction of the N/C interaction is limited to androgens that have agonist activity in vivo. Mutations in the LBD that disrupt the N/C interaction without affecting the apparent equilibrium binding affinity cause the androgen insensitivity syndrome. However, questions remain concerning the in vivo functional effects of the N/C interaction and its role in transactivation. We proposed based on indirect evidence that the agonist-induced N/C interaction induces an antiparallel arrangement of AR monomers in the AR dimer [38].
