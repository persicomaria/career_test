Abstract CTP:glycerol 3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase catalyzes the formation of CDP-glycerol, an activated form of glycerol 3-phosphate and key precursor to wall teichoic acid biogenesis in Gram-positive bacteria. There is high sequence identity (69%) between the CTP:glycerol 3phosphate cytidylyltransferases from Bacillus subtilis 168 (TagD) and Staphylococcus aureus (TarD). The B. subtilis TagD protein was shown to catalyze cytidylyltransferase via a random mechanism with millimolar Km values for both CTP and glycerol 3-phosphate [J. Biol. Chem. 268, (1993) 16648] and exhibited negative cooperativity in the binding of substrates but not in catalysis [J. Biol. Chem. 276, (2001) 37922]. In the work described here on the S. aureus TarD protein, we have elucidated a steady state kinetic mechanism that is markedly different from that determined for B. subtilis TagD. Steady state kinetic experiments with recombinant, purified TarD employed a highperformance liquid chromatography assay developed in this work. The data were consistent with a ternary complex model. The Km values for CTP and glycerol 3-phosphate were 36 and 21 AM, respectively, and the kcat was 2.6 sÀ 1. Steady state kinetic analysis of the reverse (pyrophosphorylase) reaction was also consistent with a ternary complex model. Product inhibition studies indicated an ordered Bi ­ Bi reaction mechanism where glycerol 3-phosphate was the leading substrate and the release of CDP-glycerol preceded that of pyrophosphate. Finally, we investigated the capacity of S. aureus tarD to substitute for tagD in B. subtilis. The tarD gene was placed under control of the xylose promoter in a B. subtilis 168 mutant defective in tagD (temperature-sensitive, tag-12). Growth of the resulting strain at the restrictive temperature (47 jC) was shown to be xylose-dependent. D 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

chemistry of CDP-glycerol synthesis remained relatively obscure until the discovery of tagD, encoding glycerol 3phosphate cytidylyltransferase, in the poly(glycerol phosphate) wall teichoic acid gene cluster (tag genes named after teichoic acid glycerol phosphate) of Bacillus subtilis 168 [2]. Cell wall teichoic acids are a diverse group of phosphaterich polymers that are covalently linked to peptidoglycan and constitute a substantial portion of the cell wall of Grampositive bacteria. Of the organisms so far studied, a large number produce either poly(ribitol phosphate), e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, or poly(glycerol phosphate), e.g. B. subtilis 168, as the major cell wall teichoic acids, however, considerable diversity exists in these phosphate-containing polymers [3,4]. In contrast to the diversity exhibited by the polymers, the linkage units have a less variant composition among many Gram-positive bacteria, consisting of a dis-

accharide component, most often GlcNAc ­ ManNAc or Glc ­ GlcNAc, and a series of glycerol phosphate units, numbering between one and three (Fig. 1) [5 ­ 9]. Of particular relevance to the work here on S. aureus glycerol 3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, TarD (named after teichoic acid ribitol phosphate), is the presence in the linkage unit of the glycerol phosphate component despite the existence of a poly(ribitol phosphate) polymer in this organism [5 ­7]. Hence, TarD has a central role in activating glycerol 3-phosphate for incorporation into the linkage unit of teichoic acid in S. aureus. In the model Gram-positive organism B. subtilis, a considerable body of molecular genetic evidence points to an essential role for poly(glycerol phosphate) [2,10 ­ 15], the major wall teichoic acid of that organism. The essentiality of wall teichoic acid has also been documented for other species [16,17]. Indeed, our interest in the S. aureus glycerol 3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase stems, in part, from its therapeutic relevance. The TagD enzyme of B. subtilis has been the focus of considerable biochemical study by Kent et al. [18 ­ 22]. Those studies have largely been aimed at describing and

understanding atypical allosteric behavior observed for this homodimeric enzyme. Steady state kinetic studies of the bisubstrate reaction yielded parallel lines in Lineweaver ­ Burk plots. Nonetheless, product inhibition studies were most consistent with a rapid equilibrium random ternary mechanism. Together, these findings implied negative cooperativity in the binding of substrates [21]. Steady state characterization of site-directed variants [20] and high-resolution X-ray crystallographic studies [19] highlighted the importance of HXGH and RTXGISTT motifs and confirmed that TagD belongs to a superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases including class I aminoacyltRNA synthetases [23], ATP sulfurylase, pantothenate synthetase (PanC) [24 ­ 26] and some choline-phosphate and ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferases [19]. Recently, the Kent lab used intrinsic protein fluorescence to study substrate binding to the active sites of the TagD homodimer [22]. Most intriguing was the finding that despite negative cooperativity in substrate binding, negative cooperativity in catalysis was not observed. The glycerol 3-phosphate cytidylyltransferases from B. subtilis (129 amino acids) and S. aureus (132 amino acids)

Fig. 1. Structures of teichoic acid in B. subtilis 168 and S. aureus. Teichoic acid polymer is anchored in the cell wall by covalent attachment via a phosphodiester bond between the linkage unit of teichoic acid and the 6-hydroxyl of N-acetylmuramic acid of peptidoglycan. The linkage unit is ubiquitously conserved among species of Gram-positive bacteria but the teichoic acid polymer can vary. In B. subtilis 168, the teichoic acid is comprised of 30 to 40 1 ­ 3 linking glycerol 3-phosphate residues while the teichoic acid of S. aureus consists of 1 ­ 5 linked ribitol 5-phosphate moieties [3,4]. In B. subtilis 168, TagD is responsible for the activation of glycerol 3-phosphate for both the linkage unit and the teichoic acid polymer. In S. aureus, TarD is responsible for activating glycerol 3-phosphate for subsequent incorporation into the linkage unit.

show a high degree of sequence similarity. Pairwise alignment [27] reveals 69% (89/128) identity and 86% (112/128) similarity between the two amino acid sequences of these related enzymes. Additionally, by analysis of the structure of TagD [19], it was observed that 11 of the 12 amino acids in ° TagD that are proximal to CTP (within 3.5 A) are identically conserved in TarD (1 of the 12 is a conservative substitution of tyrosine for phenylalanine 10). Despite high structural similarity between TagD and TarD, we have found that TarD catalyzes cytidylyl transfer via an ordered Bi ­Bi mechanism. Glycerol 3-phosphate is the first substrate to bind to the active site of TarD in the forward reaction while pyrophosphate is the initial substrate to bind in the reverse direction. Furthermore, our studies indicate that TarD has Km values for its substrates that are more than 100-fold lower than those reported for TagD [21]. The reaction mechanism of TarD is discussed in the context of other members of the cytidylyltransferase superfamily as well as enzymes that catalyze analogous reactions.

pBluescript using NdeI and HindIII (restriction site in pBluescript) and ligated to NdeI- and HindIII-digested pBF-9, an expression vector derived from pKK223-3 and described in Ref. [28]. The fidelity of the encoded protein sequence in this construct (pMZ-tarD) was confirmed by sequencing (MOBIX, McMaster University). 2.3. Purification of TarD The purification method was a modification of the procedure found in Ref. [21]. TarD was purified from E. coli W3110 cells, transformed with pMZ-tarD. Cells were grown (37 jC) in Luria ­ Bertani (LB) media supplemented with ampicillin (50 Ag/ml) to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.8. At this time, the cultures were induced for 5 h at 37 jC with IPTG (1 mM). The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 Â g) for 10 min at 4 jC using a Beckman Avanti J-25 centrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and washed with 0.85% NaCl. All subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4 jC and fractions containing TarD were identified using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA) with two or more passes through a French Press (20,000 psi) and clarified by centrifugation (50,000 Â g) before being loaded onto a 50 ml (2.5 Â 10 cm) Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham-Pharmacia) equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA. The column was developed at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with 5 column volumes of the above buffer followed by a linear salt gradient, from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl over 10 column volumes. TarD eluted at a salt concentration of approximately 250 mM. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT for 24 h and loaded onto a 30 ml (2.5 Â 6.5 cm) Reactive Blue 4 column (Sigma) and chromatographed (1 ml/min) in a buffer identical to the dialysis buffer. After injection, the column was washed for 5 column volumes followed by a step-wise addition of CTP (1 mM) to specifically elute TarD. To the eluted material, ammonium sulfate was added slowly to a concentration of 80% saturation and protein was pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 Â g) for 1 h. The protein pellet was resuspended in 2­ 5 ml of buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT) and applied to a 130 ml (1.6 Â 63.5 cm) Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham-Pharmacia) equilibrated (0.5 ml/min) with buffer identical to that used for resuspension of TarD. Fractions containing pure TarD were pooled, frozen in small aliquots, and stored at À 80 jC. Pure protein concentration was determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel [29]. 2.4. Oligomeric state of TarD A 24 ml (1 Â 30 cm) analytical S200 gel filtration column (Amersham-Pharmacia) was used to estimate the

oligomeric state of TarD. The elution volumes of the standards (cytochrome c, 12,400 Da; carbonic anhydrase, 29,000 Da; bovine serum albumin, 66,000 Da; alcohol dehydrogenase, 150,000 Da; h-amylase, 200,000 Da; and blue dextran 2,000,000 Da; Sigma) and TarD were determined using the FPLC software (UNICORN, Amersham Biosciences Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The running buffer of the gel filtration column contained 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT and was set to flow at a rate of 0.5 ml/ min. A standard curve of log molecular mass versus elution volume was prepared and the elution volume of TarD compared with this plot. 2.5. TarD enzyme assay A stopped assay was used to monitor the reaction catalyzed by TarD. A typical reaction contained 50 mM TRIS ­ HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, glycerol 3-phosphate, CTP (20 Ci/mmol [5-3H]CTP) and 1 ng TarD (1.26 nM) in a total volume of 50 Al. After 10 min, 150 Al of 8 M urea (6 M final concentration) was added to stop the reaction. The production of [5-3H]CDP-glycerol was monitored by HPLC (Waters 600 Pump and Controller, Waters 486 Tunable Absorbance Detector, Waters 717 Autosampler, Waters busSAT/IN module, Milford, MA) using a 4.5 Â 50 mm WP QUAT strong ion exchange column (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) and in-line radioactivity detection (Radiomatic 150TR flow scintillation analyzer, Canberra Packard Canada, Mississauga, ON). The scintillation cocktail (Ultima-Flo M, Canberra Packard Canada) was pumped at a flow rate of 6 ml/min. Reaction components (180 Al) were separated with a 20 ml chromatogram (2 ml/min): 4 ml of 20 mM triethylamine bicarbonate (TEAB), followed by a 4 ml gradient of TEAB from 20 mM to 0.5 M and 12 ml of 0.5 M TEAB. Retention times of CDP-glycerol and CTP were 14 and 18 ml, respectively. The amount of [5-3H] CDP-glycerol produced was determined by integration of the resolved peaks using the HPLC software (Millenium32, Waters). The identity of the product peak, CDP-glycerol, was confirmed by molecular mass analysis using negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry (Micromass LC quadrupole). The mass determined (475.7 g/mol) was consistent with that for CDP-glycerol (475.3 g/mol). 2.6. Steady state kinetic analysis of the forward and reverse reactions Enzyme assays were all performed at room temperature (22 jC) as describe above. The concentrations of glycerol 3phosphate ranged from 10 to 125 AM while the CTP concentration ranged from 17 to 132 AM. Data were fitted to equations that describe two different enzyme reaction mechanisms: the sequential (ternary complex) mechanism equation (Eq. (1)); and the ping-pong (covalent intermediate) mechanism equation (Eq. (2)) using GraFit 4 software

(Erithacus Software Ltd., UK) and non-linear regression methods. v ¼ Vmax ½A½B=ðKia Kmb þ Kmb ½A þ Kma ½B þ ½A½BÞ v ¼ Vmax ½A½B=ðKmb ½A þ Kma ½B þ ½A½BÞ ð1Þ ð2Þ

A and B represent the substrates glycerol phosphate and CTP, respectively. Kma and Kmb are the Michaelis constants for A and B, respectively. Vmax is the maximum velocity and Kia is defined as the dissociation constant of A from the binary complex, EA [30]. [5-3H]CDP-glycerol, required as substrate for the reverse reaction, was prepared enzymatically utilizing [5-3H]CTP and an equimolar amount of glycerol 3-phosphate. The reaction was carried out in 50 mM TRIS, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.13 units/Al inorganic pyrophosphatase and 62 AM TarD. The concentration of glycerol 3phosphate and [5-3H]CTP was 26 AM (200 ACi of labeled CTP). The reaction was carried out to near completion (greater than 97%). The specific activity of the radiolabeled CDP-glycerol was equal to that of the [5-3H]CTP (20 Ci/ mmol). For kinetic analysis of the reverse reaction, CDPglycerol ranged from 0.25 to 5 AM and pyrophosphate was varied from 1 to 10 mM. The amount of [5-3H]CDPglycerol added into the reaction ranged from 0.25 to 0.68 ACi. The production of CTP was monitored by HPLC as described for the forward reaction. The data were fit to Eq. (1) and the appropriate kinetic constants established. The Haldane relationship (Eq. (3)) was used to calculate the equilibrium constant (Keq) of the reaction from kinetic data [31]. Keq ¼ ðVmaxf Kiq Kmp Þ=ðVmaxr Kia Kmb Þ ð3Þ

Vmaxf and Vmaxr are the maximum velocities of the forward and reverse reactions. Kmb and Kmp are Michaelis ­ Menton constants and Kia and Kiq are dissociation constants, all calculated from Eq. (1). The equilibrium constant was also determined experimentally under the following conditions: 50 mM TRIS, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT 125 AM glycerol 3-phosphate, 132 AM CTP, 6.8 ACi [3H]CTP and 1 AM TarD. The progress of the reaction was monitored by anion exchange HPLC as described above. 2.7. Product inhibition studies CDP-glycerol, required for product inhibition studies, was produced enzymatically. The following conditions were used to produce CDP-glycerol in large scale: 50 mM TRIS, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 30 mM glycerol 3phosphate, 30 mM CTP, 0.02 units/Al inorganic pyrophosphatase and 5.3 AM TarD. The progress of the reaction was monitored by detection at 271 nm using HPLC. After the completion of the reaction, the synthesized CDP-glycerol was filtered through a 5 kDa MWCO Amicon Ultrafree-MC

filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to remove protein. From this synthesis, 98% of the CTP in the assay had been converted to CDP-glycerol. Subsequently, sample purity was 93% CDP-glycerol, 2% CTP and 5% CDP (contaminant in Sigma CTP) as determined by HPLC (absorbance at 271 nm). This material was used without purification. The concentration of the CDP-glycerol was calculated by measurement of the absorbance of the sample at 271 nm (e for cytidine-phosphate containing molecules is 9100 MÀ 1 cmÀ 1 at 271 nm), taking the proportion of CDP-glycerol in the preparation into account. The concentration of CDP-glycerol, used as an inhibitor, ranged from 0 to 1.2 AM while the concentration of sodium pyrophosphate (Fisher Scientific) ranged from 0 to 5 mM. The reaction conditions for these experiments were as follows: 45 mM TRIS, pH 8.0, 18 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM DTT and 6.8 ACi [5-3H] CTP. When glycerol 3-phosphate was the varied substrate, CTP was kept at approximate Km concentration (57 AM). When CTP was the varied substrate, glycerol 3-phosphate was held at 24 AM, which is also near its Km. Non-linear least-squares regression analysis was performed where data were fit to all inhibition equations in the Enzymes Module of Sigma Plot 2000 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The equations for partial competitive inhibition (Eq. (4)) and mixed (non-competitive) inhibition (Eq. (5)) were relevant to the work presented here. v ¼ Vmax =ð1 þ Km ½SÞð1 þ ½I=Kis Þ=ð1 þ ½I=aKis Þ v ¼ Vmax =ðKm =½SÞð1 þ ½I=Kis Þ þ ð1 þ ½I=Kii Þ ð4Þ ð5Þ

The parent strains in this work were wild-type (EB6) and temperature-sensitive (EB4) B. subtilis strains with genotypes hisA1 argC4 metC3 and hisA1 argC4 metC3 tag-12/29r [11], respectively. These strains were transformed with a PstI linearized fragment of pSWEET-tarD as described in Ref. [34]. EB249 (hisA1 argC4 metC3 amyEDxylR P0xylA tarD cat86) and EB215 (hisA1 argC4 metC3 tag-12f29r amyEDxylR PxylA tarD cat86) designate the wild-type and temperature-sensitive strains, respectively, with the xylose promoter upstream of tarD introduced at the amyE locus.

3. Results 3.1. Purification of TarD to homogeneity S. aureus TarD was purified from an E. coli overexpression system employing the tac [35] promoter resident on a pKK223-3-derived plasmid (see Section 2.2). Expression levels of TarD were extremely high with this system (Fig. 2), just as they were for B. subtilis TagD using the T7 expression system previously described by Park et al. [21]. Using a three-column procedure similar to that used for the B. subtilis enzyme [21], the TarD protein was purified 4.4fold in a yield of approximately 15­ 30 mg from 1 l of culture (Fig. 2). The solution molecular mass of TarD (5 mg/ml) was estimated by gel filtration chromatography to be 66,000 (average of two experiments, data not shown), consistent

Km is the Michaelis constant for the varied substrate, while Kis and Kii are the inhibition constants for the affect the inhibitor has on the slope and intercept (respectively) of double reciprocal plots. The constant a is the factor by which the inhibition constant changes when the inhibitor binds to the enzyme substrate complex [32]. To confirm the proposed reaction mechanism, an experiment with varying CTP (17 ­132 AM), pyrophosphate as the inhibitor (0­ 3 mM) and glycerol 3-phosphate at approximately 100 times the Km concentration (2.4 mM) was performed. 2.8. Construction of pSWEET-tarD and complementation of tag-12 The following primers were used to amplify tarD from S. aureus genomic DNA so as to place a consensus ribosome binding site [33] upstream of the gene: 5V -CACCTTAATTAACATTAGTAAGGAGCGTTTCTTTAATGAAACGTGTAATAACATATGGCACATATGACTTA-3V and 5V -GACGGGATCCTTATTTAGCATCTTTACCATATAATTC-3V Underlined sequences represent restriction sites . for PacI and BamHI, respectively. The amplified PCR product was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript IISK ( + ). The resulting plasmid was digested with PacI and BamHI and the sequences encoding TarD were ligated to

Protein samples at each step of the purification of TarD were analyzed by discontinuous SDS-PAGE using a 3% stacking and a 15% separating polyacrylamide gel visualized with Coomassie blue stain. Approximately 10 Ag of protein (determined by the method of Bradford [46]) was loaded in each lane. Samples were boiled for 5 min. in 2 Â loading buffer (63 mM TRIS ­ HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue).

Fig. 3. Steady state kinetic analysis of the forward and reverse reactions. (A) Double reciprocal plots of 1/velocity versus 1/[groP] are shown. The concentration of CTP was fixed at 17 AM (o), 27 AM ( ), 47 AM (5), 87 AM (n), and 132 AM (D). The data were fitted by non-linear least squares method to a sequential kinetic model where a ternary complex forms as described by Eq. (1).

into CDP-glycerol [21]. We developed an HPLC-based assay for TarD to follow the depletion of [5-3H]CTP and production of radiolabeled CDP-glycerol by anion exchange chromatography with in-line radioactivity detection. The linearity of this assay with time and with enzyme concentration at saturating and subsaturating concentrations of CTP and glycerol 3-phosphate was verified (data not shown). The enzyme concentration dependence on the forward reaction velocity was linear with a very small negative yintercept and yielded a turnover number of 1.7 sÀ 1 (data not shown), which is comparable to the calculated kcat (2.6 sÀ 1, Table 1). Initial velocity experiments were conducted to determine the kinetic mechanism and important kinetic constants for TarD. Systematic analysis of the dependence of rates on the substrate concentrations revealed a double reciprocal plot (Fig. 3A) with lines intersecting at a point left of the y-axis, which is consistent with a sequential (ternary) mechanism [30]. Kinetic constants determined from this experiment are found in Table 1. The Km's for the substrates of TarD were 21 AM for glycerol 3-phosphate and 36 AM for CTP. These values are more than 100-fold lower than those reported for the B. subtilis orthologue TagD (3.2 and 3.9 mM, respectively) [21]. The kcat of 2.6 sÀ 1 for TarD was about 19-fold lower than that determined for TagD (50 sÀ 1; calculated from Ref. [21]). Values of kcat/Km for TarD were 1.3 Â 105 and 7.2 Â 104 MÀ 1 sÀ 1 with respect to glycerol 3-phosphate and CTP, respectively (Table 1). These values are 8fold and 6-fold larger than those reported for TagD, i.e. 1.6 Â 104 and 1.3 Â 104 MÀ 1 sÀ 1 for glycerol 3-phosphate and CTP, respectively [21]. In order to study the reaction catalyzed in the reverse direction, the formation of [5-3H]CTP from TarD-synthesized [5-3H]CDP-glycerol was measured. Initial velocity experiments were conducted and, as expected, the data best fit the equation describing a sequential mechanism (Eq. (1)) (Fig. 3B). The Km's for CDP-glycerol and pyrophosphate were 1.4 AM and 9.7 mM, respectively, and kcat was 1.0 sÀ 1 (Table 1). Using the Haldane relationship (Eq. (3)), a calculated Keq of 16 was obtained. The Keq for this reaction was also determined experimentally to be 6.

with a homotetramer of molecules of average globular shape. This result is supported by preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of TarD, which suggested that there are four TarD molecules present per asymmetric unit [36]. These findings contrast with the solution molecular mass of 30,900 determined for TagD [21] and with the crystal structure [19], which indicate that the B. subtilis enzyme is a dimer. 3.2.

3.3. Product inhibition studies Although initial velocity experiments can discriminate between ping-pong and sequential mechanisms, product inhibition experiments must be performed to precisely ascertain whether the sequential mechanism is random or ordered. Moreover, if the mechanism is ordered, the sequence of binding of substrates and release of products can be discerned. Lineweaver ­ Burk plots for the product inhibition studies conducted on TarD are depicted in Figs. 4 and 5 where CDP-glycerol and pyrophosphate are utilized

Fig. 5. Analysis of inhibition of TarD by pyrophosphate. (A) Glycerol 3phosphate was varied while CTP was kept at Km concentration (57 AM). The model that best describes these data is one where pyrophosphate is a competitive inhibitor with respect to glycerol 3-phosphate (Eq. (4)). (B) When CTP is varied, and glycerol 3-phosphate is kept at Km level (24 AM), a pattern of double reciprocal plots indicating mixed inhibition is obtained. Pyrophosphate concentrations for both plots were 0 mM ( ), 0.5 mM (o), 1 mM (z), and 2 mM (q). In (A), an additional plot using 5 mM (n) pyrophosphate exists. Table 2 summarizes the inhibitor constants generated from these plots.

Fig. 4. Analysis of inhibition of TarD by CDP-glycerol. (A) Initial velocity plots were generated with varying glycerol 3-phosphate and CTP at a fixed concentration, which was approximately at Km (57 AM). The inhibition data were screened against all the inhibition models in the Sigma Plot 2000 software. From all these possible models, a mixed (non-competitive) inhibition model (Eq. (5)) was determined to be the model that best characterizes these data using non-linear regression. (B) CTP was varied while glycerol 3-phosphate was kept at Km concentration (24 AM). The data were best fit to the equation that specifies a mixed inhibition model. CDPglycerol concentrations used for (A) and (B) were 0 AM ( ), 0.1 AM (o), 0.3 AM (z), 0.6 AM (q), and 1.2 AM (n).

as inhibitors, respectively. In each of these experiments, the co-substrate was kept at a concentration near its Km. Data from these experiments were fitted to all of the inhibition models found in the Sigma Plot 2000 Enzyme Kinetics software by non-linear regression (least-squares method). The Sigma Plot 2000 software uses the Marquardt ­ Levenberg algorithm [37] to best fit the data to inhibition equations in an iterative fashion. Subsequently, the models are ranked based on an analysis of error of fit. CDP-glycerol was determined to be a mixed (non-competitive) inhibitor with respect to both glycerol 3-phosphate (Fig. 4A) and CTP (Fig. 4B) consistent with intersecting lines to the left of the y-axis [32]. Pyrophosphate was shown to be a mixed

inhibitor with respect to CTP (Fig. 5B) but competitively (partially) inhibited TarD when glycerol 3-phosphate was the varied substrate (Fig. 5A). The latter is evident from the intersection of lines directly on the vertical axis. Because pyrophosphate and glycerol 3-phosphate directly compete for binding, it can be inferred that both these compounds bind similar (apo) forms of TarD. This product inhibition pattern is a classic example of an ordered Bi ­Bi reaction mechanism [38]. Glycerol 3-phosphate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme and pyrophosphate is the last product to be released. Scheme 2 outlines the proposed mechanism of TarD as established from product inhibition analysis. This scheme contrasts with the rapid equilibrium, random order mechanism proposed for the B. subtilis orthologue, TagD [21]. The constants of inhibition are summarized in Table 2. There were striking differences between inhibition constants for pyrophosphate and CDP-glycerol. With CDP-glycerol as the inhibitor, Kis and Kii when glycerol 3-phosphate was varied were 0.5 and 2.3 AM, respectively. Similarly, Kis and Kii for CDP-glycerol with CTP as the varied substrate were 1.3 and 0.39 AM, respectively. The inhibition constants for pyrophosphate were considerably larger in magnitude. With pyrophosphate as a competitive inhibitor, Kis was 0.47 mM when glycerol 3-phosphate was varied. When CTP was the varied substrate, Kis and Kii were 3.4 and 2.0 mM, respectively, for pyrophosphate. Toward confirming the mechanism proposed in Scheme 2, the inhibition experiment using pyrophosphate as an inhibitor with varying CTP was repeated with saturating amounts of glycerol 3-phosphate (2.4 mM, about 100-fold Km). If pyrophosphate and glycerol 3-phosphate both bound to apo-TarD, then a large increase in glycerol 3-phosphate would compete out the effect of pyrophosphate as an inhibitor when CTP is varied [38]. This effect was evident in the approximately 8-fold

Complementation of the temperature-sensitive tag-12 mutation by tarD in B. subtilis 168 The finding that the steady state kinetic mechanism of S. aureus glycerol 3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase differed from that reported for the B. subtilis orthologue, TagD, prompted us to examine the ability of tarD to complement a temperature-sensitive mutation in tagD (tag-12) in B. subtilis [11]. Therefore, a copy of tarD was introduced into the temperature-sensitive tagD mutant at the amyE locus under control of a xylose-inducible promoter. Fig. 6 demonstrates inducer-dependent complementation of the tagD mutant at 47 jC, indicating that the tarD gene is able to substitute for tagD in B. subtilis 168. Further light microscopic examination of tagD mutant complemented with tarD confirmed that it exhibited wild-type morphology in the presence of xylose (data not shown) in contrast to that seen in the TagDdepleted mutant [15].

released first, followed by pyrophosphate (Scheme 2). This was discerned by steady state experiments, coupled with product inhibition studies at non-saturating and saturating substrate concentrations [38]. TarD and TagD are members of the cytidylyltransferase superfamily (also called the TagD superfamily) along with other nucleotidylyltransferases such as rat choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, human ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase [19] and ATP-sulfurylase [24,25]. Also included into this family are the class I aminoacyl-tRNA sythetases [23], and PanC [26]. This superfamily has been established around a shared and unique nucleotide-binding fold characterized by an HXGH motif. The histidine residues are clear participants in critical interactions with the a and h phosphates of the nucleotide [19]. While these structurally related proteins are thought to optimize interactions to analogous transition states, their steady state kinetic mechanisms are apparently diverse. For example, the differences in steady state kinetic mechanism deduced for TagD, PanC and ADP-sulfurylase are considerable. While the Bi­ Uni ­Uni ­ Bi ping-pong reaction mechanism of PanC more closely resembles the mechanisms of some amino-acyl tRNA synthetases [39], ATP-sulfurylase has an ordered Bi ­Bi mechanism with ATP binding first followed by sulfate with the release of pyrophosphate preceding the release of adenosine 5V -phosphosulfate [40]. Interestingly, neither of these mechanisms resembles the unique situation described for this family's namesake TagD, discussed in detail below. While there is great variability among steady state kinetic mechanisms in the cytidylyltransferase superfamily, there are several examples of ordered Bi­ Bi mechanisms for nucleotidyltransferases outside of this structural family. Many of these bear resemblance to the steady state mechanism described here for TarD. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (LicC) is a member of the GlmU/RmlA nucleotidyltransferase family [41,42] and catalyzes a sequential ordered Bi ­Bi reaction. A sequential ordered Bi ­ Bi mechanism has also been suggested for a glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase from E. coli [43] and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (named for the reverse reaction) [44]. These enzymes all bind the nucleotide substrate first and release of the nucleotide-containing product last. Interestingly, the bifunctional uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme from E. coli catalyzes a uridylyl transfer to the PII signal transduction protein via an ordered Bi ­Bi mechanism that has its nonnucleotide substrate (PII) bind first followed by UTP [45]. Although the binding of substrates is similar to TarD, the release of products in the uridylyltransferase resembles other nucleotidylyltransferases discussed here, with the nucleotide-containing product released last. Despite remarkable sequence identity (69%) and similarity (86%) between TarD and TagD, they appear to have very different steady state kinetic mechanisms. TagD was shown to carry out the CTP:glycerol 3-phosphate cytidylyl-

transferase reaction via a random mechanism where there is negative cooperativity in the binding of substrates but not in catalysis [21,22]. A model was proposed where substrates randomly bind to the TagD homodimer with decreasing affinity from submicromolar Kd values for the first substrate molecule to millimolar affinity for the final substrate molecule. That the dimer must be loaded with substrates before catalysis can occur was also proposed [22] and consistent with millimolar Km values [21]. In contrast, the Km values determined in this work for TarD are more than 100-fold lower than those described for TagD. Furthermore, kcat/Km values for TarD were nearly an order of magnitude higher than those calculated for TagD [21]. The oligomeric state of TarD was also found to diverge from that of TagD and was most consistent with a homotetrameric tertiary structure. Finally, the ability of tarD to complement a temperature-sensitive mutation in tagD illustrates that the two enzymes are equally capable of satisfying a physiological role in teichoic acid biogenesis. The steady state kinetic characterization of S. aureus TarD presented here is a critical first step to further meaningful studies of the structure and mechanism of this therapeutically relevant enzyme. These studies have additionally provided a lesson in the potential for sourcedependant variation in kinetic mechanism. With an understanding of the steady state parameters defining catalysis by TarD, the stage is now set for transient state kinetic work to which the S. aureus enzyme is ideally suited. TarD is available and soluble in high concentrations, has relatively high affinity for its substrates and possesses a turnover number that makes it amenable to millisecond rapid mixing methods. Such studies, along with high-resolution structural information [36], will provide further kinetic and mechanistic insight into catalysis by TarD.
