[24] Looking behind the Beamstop: X-Ray Solution Scattering Studies of Structure and Conformational Changes of Biological Macromolecules
By Patrice Vachette, Michel H. J. Koch, and Dmitri I. Svergun
Introduction

Advances in X-ray crystallography have made it much easier to determine high-resolution structures of biological macromolecules, even those of large macromolecular assemblies. As a consequence, the emphasis has shifted from the actual structure determination, or molecular anatomy, back to classic questions of mechanism, or molecular physiology, such as: How do differences in structure reflect adaptation in different species? What is the role of intermolecular interactions in the optimization of metabolic pathways? How are differences in structure related to pathological conditions? At a more technical level those trying to extract operational information from the rapidly increasing amount of structural data are thus more and more often faced with questions like the following: Is the (absence of) conformational change observed on ligand binding affected by crystal packing? Is the conformational transition an all-or-none, two-state process, or does it involve structural intermediates? What is the rate of the process? How are structurally known partners arranged within this noncrystallizing multiprotein complex? Can some structural features of this invisible, presumably disordered part of the molecule be characterized? These and similar questions can be addressed, and even at times answered, by shining a collimated X-ray beam on a solution of the relevant macromolecules or macromolecular assemblies. The aim of the present review

is to illustrate the use of solution scattering methods to solve problems related to the crystal structures of biological macromolecules. As a consequence important applications, which have no explicit link with crystallography, such as those related to (un)folding of proteins and nucleic acids, are hardly mentioned. For all practical purposes solution scattering measurements are nowadays carried out at synchrotron radiation or neutron facilities. The reliance on such facilities also implies that most of the experimental aspects (source, optics, sample environment, beam path, and detectors) are largely specific to a particular installation and hence not under the control of the user. They will therefore not be considered here and it will be assumed that accurate scattering and background curves, corrected for instrumental effects (e.g., smearing due to finite beam dimensions, wavelength spread, detector characteristics, etc), are available. (For an introduction, see Feigin and Svergun.1) In this context it should be noted that radiation damage can become a serious problem with X-rays, especially with the intense beams of thirdgeneration sources. Sporadic evidence suggests that intermittent exposures to an intense undulator beam (e.g., 10 exposures of 0.1 s at 1-s intervals) are significantly less damaging than the corresponding continuous (1-s) exposure (T. Narayanan and S. Finet, personal communication). It is thus good practice to collect patterns in a succession of short time frames that can be averaged after checking for possible radiation damage. For neutrons, which have energies of only a few millielectron volts, as compared ° with the 12.4 keV of 1-A X-rays, these effects are usually negligible. The following section gives a brief reminder of the main concepts of solution scattering. Details can be found in the International Tables for Crystallography2 and in several monographs.1,3
Basics of Solution Scattering

Due to the random orientation of the macromolecules in solution, the scattering depends only on the modulus of the scattering vector s ¼ 2sin/  ¼ 1/d, where  is the radiation wavelength, 2 is the scattering angle, and d denotes the Bragg resolution. Usually, the intensity patterns are

represented as functions of the momentum transfer q ¼ 2s ¼ 4sin/. The measured scattering intensity IM(q) is obtained from the number N(n) of photons or neutrons counted by the detector in the nth channel of the histogramming device as IM ðqÞ ¼ NðnÞsol =I0; sol À fNðnÞb =I0b À ð1 À f ÞNðnÞec =I0;ec (1)

where the subscripts sol, b, and ec refer to the solution, solvent (buffer), and empty cell, respectively. I0 represents the intensity of the transmitted direct beam. In actual practice, the value of f is normally taken to be 1 and expression (1) reduces to IM ðqÞ ¼ NðnÞsol =I0; sol À NðnÞb =Iob (10 )

except when concentrated solutions are studied (25 to 200 mg/ml), in which case f is taken as the volume fraction of the solvent in the solution. The relationship between the value of n, the channel number in the histogramming device, and the momentum transfer q is obtained either by calibration with a standard sample or from an accurate knowledge of the sampledetector distance, the wavelength, and physical dimensions of the detector. In general, scattering from a monodisperse solution of macromolecules is given by IM ðqÞ ¼ NM IðqÞSFðqÞ (2)

where NM is the number of macromolecules in the irradiated volume, I(q) is the scattering from a single particle averaged over all orientations, and SF(q) is the structure factor of the solution. The latter takes into account attractive or repulsive interparticle interactions and may significantly differ from unity at small angles (q < 2 nmÀ1). At infinite dilution SF(q) ¼ 1 and it is thus useful to collect the scattering intensities for a concentration series (e.g., 1, 3, and 5 mg/ml) to obtain an undistorted scattering pattern by extrapolation to zero concentration in the low-angle region. For the high angle region (q > 2 nmÀ1) it is generally necessary to use concentrated solutions (c > 10 mg/ml) to obtain a sufficient signal-to-background ratio, but the influence of the structure factor is usually negligible in this range. In the following, we concentrate on the analysis of the single particle scattering intensity I(q) that contains information about the structure of the macromolecule. For studies of the interparticle interactions through measurements of the structure factor, the reader is referred to Tardieu et al.4 Solution scattering emerges from inhomogeneities of the scattering length density in the sample due to the dissolved macromolecules (electron

density for X-rays or nuclear and spin density for neutrons). Mathematically, I(q) is the spherical average of the square of the modulus of the scattered amplitude A(q), which is the Fourier transform of the excess scattering density of the particle: I(q) ¼ <A(q) Á AÃ(q)> ¼ <F[Á(r)] Á F[Á(À r)]>. Here,  is the solid angle in reciprocal space [q ¼ (q, )], and Á(r) ¼ (r) À s, where (r) is the scattering length density distribution inside the particle and s is the scattering length density of the solvent. An important characteristic of the sample is the average value of the excess density inside the particle, that is, the contrast Á ¼ <Á(r)>. For high contrasts [Á much larger than the fluctuations of (r)], I(q) is mostly due to the shape of the macromolecule, whereas for low contrasts I(q) is dominated by the scattering from the internal particle structure. In most practical cases, scattering patterns contain both terms whereby the relative contribution of the scattering due to internal structure increases with q. The two contributions can be separated using contrast variation,5 which involves measurements at different solvent scattering length densities. The best conditions for contrast variation exist in neutron scattering due to a remarkable scattering length difference between hydrogen and deuterium. Valuable additional information about the particle structure is obtained either by measurements in different water­heavy water mixtures or by isotopic labeling of specific fragments of macromolecules.6­8 Contrast variation is especially useful for multicomponent (e.g., nucleoprotein) complexes.9­11 For X-ray studies of proteins in aqueous solutions, shape scattering usually prevails at low resolution (up to about d ¼ 2­3 nm, i.e., s < 0.5­ 0.33 nmÀ1 or q <  À 0.66  nmÀ1), whereas for higher angles the scattering data reflect the internal particle structure. Contrast variation is rarely used with X-rays since it requires the addition of small molecules (salt, sucrose, glycerol). This introduces all the complications associated with three-component systems (water, small solute, macromolecule) often compounded by large changes in absorption (e.g., with NaI, KI, or CsI) or in

solvent viscosity (e.g., with sucrose or glycerol). In X-ray scattering a good approximation of the shape scattering can be obtained by making use of Porod's law,12,13 which describes the asymptotic behavior of the scattering of homogeneous particles. At higher angles, the scattering oscillates around a straight line given by the Porod plot: q4 IðqÞ % Bq4 þ A (3)

The scattering of the corresponding homogeneous body can be obtained from the experimental data by subtracting the contribution of the internal structure given by the constant B obtained from the slope of the Porod plot. As illustrated in Fig. 1, this leads to a significant modification of the experimental data at large angles.

Fourier transformation of the scattering intensity I(q) yields the characteristic function of the particle Z 1 1 sinðqrÞ dq (4) ðrÞ ¼ 2 q2 IðqÞ 2 0 qr (r) is directly related to the distance distribution function of the particle p(r) ¼ r2(r). The latter is the spherically averaged self-convolution of the excess scattering density p(r) ¼ <Á(r) * Á(r)>, which is equal to zero beyond r ¼ Dmax, where Dmax is the maximum particle size. Figure 2 illustrates that the shape of p(r) gives direct information about the overall shape of the particles (e.g., globular or cylindrical) and/or their domain structure.
First Analysis: Distance Distribution Function and Invariants

An experimental data set after data reduction, background subtraction, and extrapolation to zero concentration is a collection of discrete points Iexp(qi), i ¼ 1, . . ., N, in a restricted angular range qmin < qi < qmax, affected by statistical errors (qi) and, possibly, also instrumental effects like the smearing associated with the size and shape of the direct beam and/or the wavelength distribution. A first check is provided by the use of the Guinier

approximation, historically the first tool of small-angle scattering data analysis, dating back to 1939.14 At small angles, the intensity is a function of only two parameters: IðqÞ % Ið0Þ exp ðÀq2 R2 =3Þ g (5)

and the slope and intercept of a Guinier plot (ln[I(q)] versus q2) readily yield the values of the radius of gyration of the particle Rg and of the forward scattering I(0). The first parameter characterizes the particle size, the second one its molecular mass. The approximation is only strictly valid in the range qRg < 1 and is sensitive to the presence of small amounts of aggregates or interparticle interactions: nonlinearity of the Guinier plot is an indication of polydispersity and/or of significant interparticle interactions in the sample solution. Linearity of the Guinier plot alone does not, however, guarantee the absence of aggregates and/or interparticle interferences. The reliability of any further analysis rests on the accuracy of computation of the distance distribution function p(r). Direct Fourier transformation [Eq. (4)] is not reliable, as the exact intensity I(q) cannot be measured, and it is thus better to compute p(r) indirectly using the inverse transformation Z D max sin qr IðqÞ ¼ 4 dr (6) pðrÞ qr 0 where Dmax is the maximum dimension of the particle.

summand). This ``indirect transform'' approach first introduced by Glatter15 is usually superior to other data-processing techniques as it imposes strong constraints, namely boundedness and smoothness of p(r). Note that an approximate estimate of Dmax is usually known a priori and can be further refined by successive calculations with different values of Dmax. The main problem when using an indirect transform technique is to select the proper value of the regularizing multiplier . Too-small values of  yield solutions that are unstable to experimental errors, whereas too large values lead to systematic deviations from the experimental data. The program GNOM16,17 provides the necessary guidance using a set of perceptual criteria describing the quality of the solution. The program either finds the optimal solution automatically or signals that the assumptions about the system (e.g., the value of Dmax) are incorrect. The forward scattering and the radius of gyration are readily derived from the p(r) as R Z r2 pðrÞdr 2 Ið0Þ ¼ 4 pðrÞdr; Rg ¼ R (9) 2 pðrÞdr This method implicitly makes use of the entire scattering curve and is thus more reliable than the direct evaluation of Rg using the Guinier approximation.
Modeling Tools

Ab Initio Methods An unambiguous ab initio reconstruction of three-dimensional models from one-dimensional scattering curves is clearly not possible without imposing restrictions on the model. The simplest and most frequently used method is to limit the search to homogeneous models, usually a valid assumption at low resolution. In the past, trial-and-error approaches involving evaluation of scattering patterns from different simple shapes (spheres, ellipsoids, cylinders, etc.) and their comparison with the experimental data were popular. A modern version of this approach implemented in the program SASMODEL combines ellipsoids and cylinders filled with a dense random arrangement of spheres to compute p(r).18 More recently, ab initio

The use of an angular envelope function is limited to not-too-complicated shapes (in particular, without holes inside the particle). A more comprehensive description is achieved by the bead methods.28,29 A spherical volume with diameter Dmax is filled by M densely packed spheres of much smaller radius r0. Each of these spheres may belong either to the particle (index ¼ 1) or to the solvent (index ¼ 0), and the shape is thus fully described by a binary string X of length M. Starting from a random distribution of 1's and 0's, the model is randomly modified using a Monte Carlolike search to find a binary string (i.e., the shape) that fits the experimental data. As the search models usually contain thousands of beads, the solution must be constrained by imposing conditions of compactness and connectivity. In the simulated annealing procedure of Svergun,29 an explicit penalty term P(X) is added to the goal function f(X) ¼ 2 þ P(X) to meet these conditions. In the original method of Chacon et al.,28 which relies on a genetic algorithm, the solution is implicitly constrained by gradually decreasing r0 during minimization, whereas in the latest version30 explicit constraints have also been added. Other Monte Carlo-based ab initio approaches have been proposed, such as the ``give-n-take'' procedure31 and a model of interconnected ellipsoids.32 The ability of these methods to satisfactorily restore low-resolution shapes of macromolecules from solution scattering data was demonstrated in test examples and in several applications.24,25,30,33­35 A principal limitation of the shape determination methods lies in the necessity to fit the shape scattering curve. As discussed in the introduction, X-ray scattering data at higher resolution are dominated by the contribution from the internal structure, and in practice only a restricted portion of the scattering patterns can be used. This not only limits the resolution

to 2­3 nm but also the reliability of the models. A new approach to reconstruct protein models including wide-angle X-ray scattering data up to a resolution of 0.5 nm has been proposed.36 The C atoms of neighboring amino acid residues in the primary sequence are separated by approximately 0.38 nm so that at 0.5-nm resolution a protein can be regarded as an assembly of dummy residues (DR) centered at the C positions (the number of residues M is usually known from the protein or translated DNA sequence). The method starts from a randomly distributed gas of M DRs in a spherical search volume of diameter Dmax. Following a simulated annealing protocol, a DR taken at random is relocated within the search volume to an arbitrary point at a distance of 0.38 nm from another randomly selected DR. The compactness criterion used in shape determination is replaced by a requirement for the model to have a ``chain-compatible'' spatial arrangement of the DRs that fits the experimental scattering pattern. Compared with shape determination, DR modeling substantially improves the resolution and reliability of the models and has potential for further development (e.g., use of residue-specific information). An example of application of different ab initio methods is presented in Fig. 3, which displays the reconstructed models of hen egg white lysozyme superimposed on its atomic structure in the crystal (PDB entry 6lyz37). Lysozyme is a small protein [molecular mass (MM) ¼ 14.3 kDa, 129 residues], and the contribution from the internal structure dominates its solution scattering curve starting from q ¼ 2 nmÀ1 (Fig. 4). The low-resolution models restored by ab initio shape determination (programs SASHA and DAMMIN) are only able to fit the low-angle portion of the experimental scattering pattern, but still provide a fair approximation of the overall appearance of the protein. The dummy residues method (program GASBOR) neatly fits the entire scattering pattern and yields a significantly more detailed model. If reliable information about the particle structure is available it should, of course, also be used with ab initio methods. In particular, symmetry restrictions significantly speed up the computations and reduce the effective number of model parameters. In the programs SASHA, DAMMIN, and GASBOR, symmetry restrictions associated with the point groups P2 to P6 and P222 to P62 can be imposed.

X-ray scattering patterns from proteins with known atomic structure indicated that it is indispensable to include a hydration shell to adequately describe the experimental data. This can be done by surrounding the macromolecule by a 0.3-nm-thick hydration layer with an adjustable density b, which may differ from that of the bulk solvent s.43 Typically, this border layer has a density of 1.05 to 1.20 times that of the bulk. Taking advantage of the significantly different contrasts between the protein and the solvent for X-rays and neutrons in H2O and D2O it was demonstrated that the higher scattering density in the shell cannot be explained by disorder or mobility of the surface side chains in solution and that it is indeed due to a higher density of the bound solvent.44 The scattering from such a particle (macromolecule with hydration shell) in solution is then D E IðqÞ ¼ jAa ðqÞ À s As ðqÞ þ b Ab ðqÞj2 (14)

where Aa(q) is the scattering amplitude from the particle in vacuo, As(q) and Ab(q) are, respectively, the scattering amplitudes from the excluded volume and the hydration layer, both with unit density, and b ¼ bÀs. This method is implemented in the computer programs CRYSOL41 for X-rays and CRYSON44 for neutrons. These programs utilize spherical harmonics expansion and compute partial amplitudes Alm(q) for all terms in Eq. (14), which permits the performance of analytical spherical averaging [see Eq. (12)]. The partial amplitudes can also be used in rigid body modeling as described below. Given the atomic coordinates, for example, from the Protein Data Bank,45,46 these programs either fit the experimental scattering curve using two free parameters, the excluded volume of the particle and the contrast of the hydration layer b, or predict the scattering pattern using the default values of these parameters. Rigid Body Refinement The concept of rigid body refinement of quaternary structures against solution scattering data is readily illustrated by considering a macromolecule consisting of two domains with known atomic structures.

The structure and the scattering intensity from such a complex depend on the six positional and rotational parameters and these can be refined to fit the experimental scattering data.

proper intersubunit contacts. Relevant biochemical information (e.g., contacts between specific residues) can be taken into account by using an interactive search mode. Enhanced possibilities for combining interactive and automated search strategies are provided by the rigid body modeling systems ASSA for major UNIX platforms39,49 and MASSHA for Wintelbased machines.50 In these systems, a main three-dimensional graphics program is coupled with computational modules implementing Eq. (15). This permits the user to interactively manipulate the subunits as rigid bodies while observing corresponding changes in the fit to the experimental data and to start automated search programs performing an exhaustive search in a specified range of positional parameters. Addition of Missing Loops and Domains Protein function is related not only to the three-dimensional arrangement of polypeptide chains but among other factors also to their intrinsic mobility. Conformational heterogeneity in proteins often renders flexible loops undetectable in structures determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. In large multidomain proteins, inherent flexibility between domains can prevent successful crystallization, and in these cases high-resolution analysis may be limited to studies of individual domains produced using genetic or proteolytic methods. SAXS offers the possibility of obtaining complementary information about the structures of disordered or missing protein fragments. Methods have been developed for adding missing loops or domains by fixing a known portion of the structure and building the unknown regions to fit the experimental scattering data obtained from the entire particle.51 These methods are based on an extension of the dummy residue approach described above in the section on ab initio methods. The program CREDO adds domains to low-resolution structural models in the form of a chainlike distribution of dummy residues without specific residue information. The programs CHADD and GLOOPY complement the available high-resolution models by adding the loops or domains at appropriate locations along the polypeptide chain to obtain the best fit to the solution scattering data. The program CHADD represents the missing loops/domains in terms of free residues described by their C positions, connected by spring forces along the chain and subject to excluded volume constraints. The program GLOOPY employs additional residue-specific information (hydrophobicity,52 knowledge-based potentials53), as well as

restrained distributions of angles and dihedral angles involving adjacent C atoms,54 to construct native-like folds of the missing domains and loops. The program CHARGE may be used to further account for the secondary structure of the missing fragments. Following validation with a series of simulated examples, these methods were used to add missing loops or domains to several proteins for which partial structures were available.51
Automated Constrained Fit Procedure

Another approach to shape modeling has been developed that is more specifically oriented toward the study of large, modular proteins such as those encountered in the complement system.55 Homology modeling is used to obtain a structure for each domain of the multidomain protein and a library of conformations for each flexible linker is created using molecular dynamics calculations. Starting from this information more than 104 possible models are generated and represented as assemblies of small spheres from which the scattering patterns are calculated using Debye's formula.56 Only those models are retained that give values of selected structural parameters (e.g., the radius of gyration and the radius of gyration of the cross-section in the case of elongated particles) in agreement with the experimental values. They are finally ranked according to the quality of the fit to the experimental scattering data. A study of monomeric factor H of human complement, a protein comprising 20 domains, illustrates this procedure and leads to the conclusion that the molecule is bent back on itself and flexible in solution, a result attributed to the presence of several long linker sequences.55 This conclusion could already be anticipated from ° the comparison between the value of Dmax (380 A) and that of the fully ° extended chain (750 A).

crystallization, often facilitates matters. The case of arcelin-1, a 244-residue lectin-like glycoprotein expressed in the seeds of the kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), which it protects from predation by larvae, provides a good example of such studies. SAXS revealed that the protein is active as a dimer in solution and that anions have specific effects on its aggregation, solubility, and crystal growth.57 These results were used to optimize the crystallization conditions. In the crystals, which diffract beyond 0.19-nm resolution, noncrystallographic symmetry-related arcelin-1 molecules form a lectin-like dimer. A solvent-exposed anion binding site at a crystalpacking interface of the protein explains the solution properties of arcelin-1 and the observed crystal twinning. The systematic study of interactions between proteins in solution (see Tardieu et al.4) is especially important in the context of crystal growth studies. The second application, which obviously requires monodisperse solutions, is ab initio modeling of the shape of the macromolecule. Some examples include the structures of pyruvate decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae,58,59 FKBPmem from Legionella pneumophila,60 and a functional unit of Rapana venosa hemocyanin.61 In general, the ab initio shapes are in good agreement with the corresponding crystallographic models, which became available later.62­64 A detailed comparison of a series of thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes65 revealed, however, significant differences between the crystal and SAXS structures, as explained in the next section. Ab initio shape determination is also useful when only incomplete crystallographic models are available. As an example, the shape of the

complete F1 ATPase complex from Escherichia coli, which contains five subunits in the stoichiometry 3 3e, was determined ab initio from solution scattering data to a resolution of 3 nm.66 The 3 3 moiety, which is well defined in the crystal structure,67 could be located unambiguously in the shape of the complex. The , , and e subunits, which are partly or completely unresolved in the electron density maps, were interactively located by rigid body modeling inside the remaining space using the structure of the -helical domain of the  subunit and the NMR structures of the  and e subunits.68,69 The resulting model, which minimizes the discrepancy between the experimental and calculated scattering curves, incorporates not only structural data but is also compatible with the available crosslinking evidence. A comparison of the shape of the model with that of bovine F1 ATPase70 illustrates the close structural similarity between the two complexes.71 Differences between the positions of the subunits that are not homologous can only be resolved by a high-resolution structure for the E. coli F1 ATPase.72 Attempts have also been made to use SAXS envelopes as a search model in molecular replacement. This approach has been shown to be successful with two crystals of oligomeric proteins, the trimer nitrite reductase73 and the dimer superoxide dismutase.74 The noncrystallographic symmetry reduced the problem from a six-parameter to a more manageable four-parameter search. This approach should also be useful for large structures. The cryoelectron microscopy model of the 50S bacterial ribosome75 was used for initial phasing of the crystal structure.76 The model

obtained from solution scattering,77 which was in good agreement with the EM model, could have been used in a similar way. Crystal Structure Available With the high rate at which crystal structures are solved, which should further increase with the structural genomics initiatives, solution studies will in many cases start with a knowledge of the crystal structure of the protein under investigation or at least of a related one. Similarly, for large, supramolecular assemblies, EM models might be available. This opens new opportunities for the interpretation of SAXS data by providing an independent starting point for structural studies. Comparison between Crystal and Solution Structures. It is generally accepted that at the resolution achieved by SAXS, the crystal and solution structures of a protein are essentially identical, in spite of crystal-packing constraints. By and large, this statement is valid in the case of small, globular, single-domain proteins. This is largely due to the high solvent content of macromolecular crystals, generally between 30 and 60% (v/v), ensuring a proper solvation of the molecules. A reality check is, however, always useful as significant and sometimes even major differences are observed in an increasing number of multidomain proteins. Bacteriophage T4 lysozyme, a 164-residue protein comprising two domains, provides an excellent example. In the absence of ligand, wild-type T4 lysozyme crystallizes in a closed conformation similar to the peptidoglycan-bound form.78 The first experimental evidence for a more open conformation of the unliganded protein in solution than in the crystal was obtained by SAXS.79 More recently a solution NMR study in which the domain orientation was determined using dipolar couplings also concluded that differences exist between the average solution and crystal conformations for both the unliganded and the substrate-bound enzyme.80 Unligated glutamate dehydrogenase from Thermococcus profondus, which consists of six identical (MM ¼ 46 kDa) subunits, each comprising two domains of roughly the same size separated by the active site cleft, has been investigated by cryocrystallography and SAXS.81 Significant

conformational differences in the orientation of the two domains of the subunits, which most likely result from hinge-bending movements, were found and the SAXS patterns indicate that the hexamer is slightly larger in solution than in the crystal. The authors propose that the enzyme displays spontaneous domain motions in solution that are trapped in the crystal through different crystal contacts, although with reduced magnitude. The structural analysis includes a careful study of the hydration water, correlating in particular the observed variations in the active site cleft between the different subunits with the domain motions and discussing possible coupling between the two sets of changes. The importance of packing forces is further illustrated by a comparative study of multisubunit thiamine phosphate-dependent enzymes from various organisms.65 Among the proteins investigated, only the compact pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis adopts the same conformation in solution and in the crystal. In contrast, there are significant differences between the calculated and experimental patterns of transketolase, native and pyruvamide-activated pyruvate decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and pyruvate oxidase from Lactobacillus plantarum. Using rigid body movements of domains in the crystal structure--essentially rotations around a flexible hinge--models yielding much improved agreement with the experimental data were found. Interestingly, a clear correlation was found between the magnitude of the distortions induced by the crystal packing and the interfacial area between subunits. Another striking case is that of the R structure of aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) from E. coli, the enzyme catalyzing the first step of the biosynthetic pathway of pyrimidines, the condensation of carbamyl phosphate and aspartate. ATCase is a highly regulated enzyme with positive homotropic cooperativity for the binding of the substrate l-aspartate, heterotropic activation by ATP, and inhibition by CTP. This textbook illustration of allostery comprises two trimers of catalytic chains (MM ¼ 34 kDa) and three dimers of regulatory (r) chains (MM ¼ 17 kDa) forming the 306kDa holoenzyme with quasi-D3 symmetry. Both nucleotides bind to the same site on the regulatory chain, about 6 nm away from the nearest active site. The solution scattering curves computed from the crystal structures of the T82 and R83 states of the enzyme were compared with the experimental X-ray scattering patterns. Experimental and calculated T curves agree, while large deviations reflecting significant differences between the quaternary structures in the crystal and in solution are observed for the R state.84

The experimental curve of the R state was fitted using rigid body movements of the subunits in the crystal R structure. Taking the latter as a reference, the distance between the catalytic trimers along the 3-fold axis is increased by 0.34 nm (from 1.08 to 1.42 nm with respect to the T structure) and the trimers are rotated by 11 around the same axis, while the regula tory dimers are rotated by 9 around the corresponding 2-fold axis. The crystal structures used for this study displayed no density for the seven N-terminal residues of the r chains. Reinvestigation of the rigid body modeling using subsequent higher-resolution structures85,86 with complete r chains confirmed the initial conclusions with a somewhat smaller increase in the distance between the two trimers (0.28 instead of 0.34 nm).87 As allosteric enzymes appear to have been selected for easy reorganization on ligand binding, involving only low-energy noncovalent interactions, it is not entirely surprising that the crystal-packing forces which also originate from noncovalent bonds between neighboring molecules would distort these subtle architectures. Similar changes, although of smaller amplitude, are likely to be observed with increasing frequency in the case of allosteric proteins, complexes or larger assemblies. Here, the combination of a highresolution crystal study with solution work is an absolute requirement and one can only concur with the authors of the NMR study on T4 lysozyme mentioned above when they emphasize ``the importance of alternative methods to X-ray crystallography for evaluating inter-domain structure,''80 simply to add that SAXS could well be one of them. Grb2 is an adaptor protein composed of an SH2 domain flanked on either side by an SH3 domain, which is involved in a variety of signal transduction cascades through interactions of its different domains with specific sites on a number of partner proteins.88 In the crystal Grb2 forms a dimer in which the monomer has a compact structure with the two SH3 domains in close contact.89 The suggestion that the molecule was likely to adopt a more open and flexible conformation in solution,89 thereby facilitating interactions with various target proteins, was confirmed by a joint NMR and SAXS study of Grb2 in solution.88 From the NMR study of the whole protein and of its isolated domains, it follows that the two SH3 domains maintain their individual structure within the protein, without detectable interactions.

domains appears to be much more flexible than other regions. The SAXS study indicates that in solution Grb2 is a relatively extended and flexible monomer with significantly larger radius of gyration and maximum dimension than derived from the crystal structure. Starting from the latter, molecular dynamics was used to generate 750 possible structures of Grb2, forming an ensemble considered to represent the ``solution model,'' which also yielded a distance distribution function p(r) close to the experimental curve. The analysis of the intra- and interdomain distance distributions led to the conclusion that in solution, Grb2 exists in an ensemble of conformations with relatively open structures. The structure of complexes is particularly likely to be affected by crystallization conditions and crystal-packing interactions and it is thus especially important to verify the relevance of symmetric arrangements which these interactions may induce. A case in point is that of the ternary complex between aminoacyl-tRNA, elongation factor Tu, and guanosine triphosphate,90 where the existence of a trimeric assembly, similar to that observed in the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of an otherwise similar complex91 and thought to be the physiologically relevant form, could be excluded. Singular value decomposition of these SAXS titration curves also indicated that there was no temperature dependence of the complex stoichiometry in contrast with the results of previous RNase A protection experiments. The investigation of the growth of low-pH crystals of BPTI combining diffraction and SAXS in solution provides an even clearer example of such effects.92 Crystallization of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) at acidic pH in the presence of thiocyanate, chloride, and sulfate ions leads to three different polymorphs in P21, P6422, and P6322 space groups. The same decamer with 10 BPTI molecules organized through two perpendicular 2-fold and 5-fold axes forming a well-defined compact object is found in the three polymorphs. In contrast, at basic pH only monomeric crystal forms are observed. The SAXS data recorded during crystallization of BPTI at pH 4.5 in both undersaturated and supersaturated BPTI solutions were analyzed in terms of the formation of discrete oligomers (n ¼ 1 to 10). In addition to the monomer, a dimer, a pentamer, and a decamer were identified within the crystal structure and their scattering patterns were

computed using CRYSOL (Fig. 5). The experimental curves were then analyzed as linear combinations of these theoretical patterns using a nonlinear curve-fitting procedure. The results, confirmed by gel filtration experiments, unambiguously demonstrate the coexistence of two different BPTI particles in solution: a monomer and a decamer, without any evidence for other intermediates. The fraction of decamers increases with salt concentration (i.e., when reaching and crossing the solubility curve). This suggests that crystallization of BPTI at acidic pH is a two-step process whereby decamers first form in under- and supersaturated solutions followed by the growth of what are best described as ``BPTI decamer'' crystals. Conformational Changes on Ligand Binding. Although functionally important changes caused by substrate or effector binding can be limited to reorientation of a (few) side chain(s), domain movements are frequently observed. These are best studied in parallel in crystals and in solution. If crystals of both the unliganded and the bound forms are available, a high-resolution description of the structural change can be obtained, with the solution investigation validating or completing this picture. Some caution is required in the interpretation of solution data, especially when no independent measure of the extent of binding (e.g., spectroscopy) is available, as one is more often than not dealing with equilibria. An excellent illustration of this kind of investigation is provided by the SAXS study of the effect of ligand binding on the association properties and conformation of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of nuclear receptors for retinoic acid, RXR and RAR.93 While the crystal structures of RXR and RAR LBDs are in good agreement with the average conformation in solution, some interesting new features were observed in the latter environment. Measurements on (apo/apo, apo/holo, and holo/holo) RXR/RAR LBD heterodimers, where apo and holo refer to the occupancy of the ligandbinding site, revealed the existence of three conformational states suggesting that the subunits are structurally independent within the heterodimers. Unliganded RXR LBD forms dimers and tetramers in solution, and a structural model of this autorepressed tetramer was proposed, which was confirmed by an independent crystal study.94 In contrast to the monomer observed in the crystal, holo RXR LBD is a dimer in solution. Multimeric proteins are often difficult to crystallize while their individual subunits are more amenable to crystallization and structure

determination. An illustrative case is that of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a tetramer comprising two identical catalytic (C) subunits and two regulatory (R) subunits. The crystal structure of the C subunit has been solved, as well as that of the cAMP-binding site of the R subunit together with the NMR structure of the dimerization domain of the R subunit. Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering were used to investigate the quaternary structure of the holoenzyme and of a heterodimer ÁRC (ÁR is a truncation mutant of R) with partially deuterated R subunits, which enabled the authors to obtain structural parameters of the C and R subunits within the complex.18 From these data, a low-resolution model was derived for the holoenzyme and the dimer, using the program SASMODEL mentioned earlier. The crystal structures of C and ÁR fit well within the shape of the RC dimer model, with C in a closed conformation similar to that observed for C with a bound pseudosubstrate peptide. The model for PKA holoenzyme has an extended dumbbell shape, which was constrained by taking into account the results of several mutation studies identifying the likely residues important for R­C interactions. Finally, the study suggests that the PKA structure may be flexible with a hinge movement of each lobe with respect to the dimerization domain. This approach combining the available biochemical and mutagenesis data with crystallographic, NMR, and solution scattering studies has been successfully applied to a number of systems such as troponin C­troponin I interactions,95 calmodulin­myosin light chain kinase interactions,96 and the assembly of immunoglobulin-like modules in titin.97 A study of ligand-induced conformational changes involves the R form of allosteric ATCase mentioned above. A new and even more extended form of the enzyme was observed for the ternary complex of the enzyme with PALA (N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate), a bisubstrate analog, and the allosteric activator Mg-ATP.87 Here, the increase in the intertrimer distance with respect to the crystallographic R structure amounts to 0.44 nm, that is, 40% larger than above. A proposal is put forward to account for the difference between free ATP, which causes no other difference in the scattering pattern than that directly due to its contribution to scattering, and Mg-ATP. The main features of a plausible mechanism for the effect of Mg-ATP are delineated, based on the crystal structures of the enzyme in the presence of ATP. It is worth mentioning that the information content of the SAXS pattern is sufficient to establish that Mg-ATP specifically

Indeed, the SAXS pattern constitutes a specific and sensitive probe of the quaternary structure of the enzyme, which can be used to titrate the T­R structural transition at equilibrium, recording a series of patterns (typically 20 curves) at different substrate concentrations.98,99 The entire data set is then analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD), a method giving the minimal number of component patterns (i.e., conformations) involved in the transition. An experiment using PALA, from which a few representative curves are shown in Fig. 6, was performed. The three welldefined crossing points shown by arrows are already suggestive of a twostate transition. This is confirmed by the SVD analysis, which indicates that all curves can be approximated within experimental errors by a linear combination of only two eigenvectors. In other words, the transition triggered by PALA only involves the two extreme structures T and R, without any detectable intermediate species. This supports the view of an equilibrium between the two forms that is shifted by PALA binding as proposed by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux in their model of a concerted transition.100 With only two components, the analysis gives, after proper scaling, the fractional concentration of each form, thereby leading to the titration curve of the structural transition, that is, the variation of the fraction of molecules in the R state versus the active site occupancy represented by the thin line in the inset of Fig. 6. Practically all molecules appear to be in the R state when only two-thirds of the active sites are occupied. Similar titration experiments have been performed using succinate, an analog of aspartate, in the presence of saturating amounts of carbamyl phosphate (CP).99 Again, only two quaternary structures are detected. However, the scattering patterns of the unligated enzyme (T state) and of the ATCase­CP complex display small but significant differences. An SVD analysis established that a third quaternary structure is involved. This proves that CP modifies the quaternary structure of ATCase to a T0 state, close to but different from T. A last titration experiment by PALA in the presence of saturating amounts of CP also reveals a two-state transition, but the titration curve is systematically shifted by 10 to 15% toward R (inset of Fig. 6, solid symbols). Therefore, CP changes the quaternary structure of ATCase to T0 , a structure more readily converted to R by PALA.99 This work illustrates the use of SAXS as a probe of the conformation of an enzyme for structural

Removal of metal atoms from metalloproteins may cause major structural rearrangements as reported in a study of human ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing serum glycoprotein with multiple functions.101 The crystal structure at 0.31-nm resolution reveals that the 1046-amino acid-long polypeptide chain is folded in six similar domains arranged in three pairs

forming a triangular array around a pseudo-3-fold axis and joined by flexible linkers, with three mononuclear copper sites in domains 2, 4, and 6 and a trinuclear cluster at the interface between N-terminal domain 1 and C-terminal domain 6 (Fig. 7B).102,103 The apo form of the molecule following copper removal was proposed to be in a ``molten globule'' state.104 On removal of copper, the SAXS pattern undergoes a dramatic modification (Fig. 7A), with a 40% increase in both the radius of gyration (from 3.25 to 4.52 nm) and the maximum dimension (from 11.0 to 15.5 nm) indicative of a large structural change toward a more open conformation. Based on the crystal structure with its quasisymmetrical distribution of domains and the trinuclear copper site at the N and C interface, it was proposed that this interface no longer exists in the absence of copper. This allows each of the (1,2) and (5,6) pairs of domains, connected to the central (3,4) pair by flexible linkers, to move freely in solution, leading to a more extended conformation of the entire apo molecule, in qualitative agreement with the SAXS observations. Calculated SAXS patterns obtained by rigid body movements on models yield an excellent agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 7A, thick line; and Fig. 7B). As one is dealing with a protein exploring a large conformational space, the specific open model obtained by this procedure represents nothing more than the conformation that best fits the data. This is a clear example in which crystal studies cannot give a direct answer, although the crystal structure of the holo form is necessary for a meaningful interpretation of the scattering data. An example of the power of coupling SAXS to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS) based on a known crystal structure is provided by a study of the ligand-induced conformational change in transferrin.105 Indeed, previous crystallographic and SAXS studies led to questions concerning the nature of the change: was the apo molecule sufficiently mobile to continuously explore a sufficiently large conformational space to also sample the closed form, or was the open conformational state a well-defined one, with the molecule only occasionally in the closed state? Several mutants were constructed and studied by SAXS. One, with the mutation located close to one of the hinges, was also studied by XAFS to probe possible ligand

In addition, some of the mutants are in an intermediate conformation, displaying the initial 20 hinge­twist of one domain without the hinge-bending motion, suggesting a two-step process for the closure of the interdomain cleft.

Large Structures A special case of incompleteness occurs for large structures such as viruses for which low-resolution (100­1 nm) and high-resolution (1.5­0.3 nm) data may be available from cryoelectron microscopy and crystallography, respectively. Merging such data, which have only small, if any, overlap, is greatly facilitated by small-angle diffraction106 and also leads to much improved models where loosely ordered regions (e.g., nucleic acids), which scatter but do not diffract, can be detected. For spherical particles the intensities can also be usefully compared with those of the scattering patterns in solution. Small-angle scattering data also yield better approximations to the contrast transfer function for image reconstruction in electron microscopy107 for icosahedral and spherical particles. A wide-angle X-ray solution scattering pattern was also successfully used to correct for the contrast transfer function in the cryo-EM study of the 70S ribosome from E. coli at a resolution of 1.15 nm.108 Using contrast variation on specifically deuterated ribosomes, a map of the protein­RNA distribution in the 70S ribosome from E. coli at a resolution of 3 nm was constructed,11 which was confirmed by high-resolution crystallographic studies.109,110 This is an area where progress can be expected as an increasing number of large structures is being investigated. Time-Resolved Experiments The availability of high-flux X-ray beams and high rate detectors has revived interest in fast kinetic studies. This is true for crystallography and SAXS alike. The aims are, however, different in both approaches. Crystallography, using the wide bandpass radiation from an undulator in single bunch mode together with femtosecond laser excitation aims at determining the steps of a (hypothetical) defined chemical mechanism (i.e., the sequence of rupture and formation of covalent bonds in the substrate and occasionally between enzyme and substrate) on the femtosecond to picosecond scale.111,112 Alternatively, hypothetical intermediate structures are

flash-frozen and studied in a more conventional way.113 In contrast, SAXS addresses global, quaternary structure changes and entropy-driven assembly processes, which occur with characteristic times on the order of 1 ms (i.e., essentially diffusive or dissipative processes, as opposed to strictly chemical processes). The process is initiated using fast mixing devices (stopped-flow)114 or other perturbation methods. For instance, the kinetics of the allosteric transition of ATCase has been investigated at low tem perature (À5 ) in the presence of glycerol to slow down the reaction, yielding kinetic results supporting the model of a concerted transition.115 Assembly mechanisms can also be studied, as well as the (un)folding of proteins or nucleic acids.116 Some steps in assembly and maturation processes in viruses117,118 or Ca2+-dependent swelling119 are other examples of time-resolved studies. This last study is currently being pursued using both the intense beam of the ESRF to increase the useful resolution of the data and neutrons at the ILL to distinguish the rearrangement of the protein capsid from that of the RNA moiety. The study of the first and fastest events in protein folding or unfolding occurring in the submillisecond range can benefit from the use of pink radiation,120­122 the wide bandpass beam coming from a double multilayer monochromator123 or from the unmonochromatized first harmonic of an undulator, the higher orders being eliminated by mirrors. Obviously, radiation damage is a major concern in these applications. Here too, the

availability of the crystal structure of the starting and/or the end point of a structural transition considerably increases the potential and scope of the analysis of time-resolved data. The basic numerical techniques used to detect intermediates (e.g., singular value decomposition) or to model scattering curves124 are essentially the same as those used for equilibrium studies on mixtures.
Conclusion and Perspectives

The perception of small-angle X-ray scattering by solutions of biological macromolecules has undergone deep changes as large facilities and increasingly powerful data analysis and modeling software have made it more accessible to a larger community. The value of SAXS and the unique links it provides between high- and low-resolution structure determination methods and also between structural, hydrodynamic, and other scattering methods has been amply demonstrated in many applications. Indeed, a growing number of crystallographers show interest in using SAXS as a complement to crystal studies. A new generation of SAXS instruments using undulator beams has become available at several facilities. The full potential of these instruments, especially for time-resolved experiments, has not yet been exploited, and the modeling methods clearly also have a margin of progress. One can therefore be confident that SAXS will become in the near future part of the methodological toolkit of any structural biologist and will allow those who realize that there is no life at equilibrium to contribute significantly to the understanding of the more complex interactions and structural changes that are characteristic of biological systems.
