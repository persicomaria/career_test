The multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) family constitutes a significant class of transcriptional regulators whose members control a variety of important biological functions such as regulation of response to environmental stress, control of virulence factor production, resistance to antimicrobial agents, and regulation of aromatic catabolic pathways. Although the majority of MarR family members have been characterized as transcriptional repressors, a few examples of transcriptional activators have also been reported. BldR is a newly identified member of this family that has been demonstrated to act as a transcriptional activator in stress response to aromatic compounds in the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. In this work, we report findings on the BldR X-ray crystal structure and present a molecular modeling study on the complex that this protein forms with its cognate DNA sequence, thus providing the first detailed description of the DNA-binding mechanism of an archaeal activator belonging to the MarR family. Two residues responsible for the high binding specificity of this transcriptional regulator were also identified. Our studies demonstrated that, in Archaea, the capability of MarR family members to act as activators or repressors is not related to a particular DNA-binding mechanism but rather could be due to the position of the binding site on the target DNA. Moreover, since genes encoding MarR proteins often control transcription of operons that encode for multisubstrate efflux pumps, our results also provided important insights for the identification of new tools to overcome the microorganism's multidrug resistance.

Introduction
Although the mechanisms and regulation of gene expression in Archaea have been widely studied in recent years, we still know relatively little about these issues compared to advances in transcription in Eukarya and Bacteria.1,2 These studies have highlighted that transcription initiation in Archaea is catalyzed by a single multisubunit enzyme (i.e., eukaryal-like RNA polymerase)3,4 and its initiation factors, namely, the TATA element binding protein (TBP) and eukaryotic TFIIB-like transcription factor

560 B (TFB). In particular, TBP recognizes and binds to an archaeal promoter consisting of a T/A-rich TATA-like element, positioned immediately downstream of the binding site for TFB (i.e., the B recognition element). Subsequently, the TBP­TFB­DNA complex recruits RNA polymerase to the promoter to specifically initiate transcription at an initiator sequence that is located about 25 bp downstream of the TATA element.1,2 Thus, the minimal archaeal transcription preinitiation complex appears to be a simplified version of the eukaryotic RNA Pol II system.5 However, the majority of archaeal DNAbinding proteins with known gene-regulatory function are homologous to bacterial activators and repressors, with only a few transcriptional regulators resembling the eukaryotic ones.6,7 How these "bacterial-like" regulators interact with the "eukaryotic-like" basal transcription machinery of Archaea is still a matter of debate. The multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) family is a significant class of transcriptional regulators, since its members control a variety of important biological functions such as regulation of response to environmental stress, control of virulence factor production, resistance to antimicrobial agents, and regulation of aromatic catabolic pathways. These proteins are abundantly distributed throughout the bacterial and archaeal domains.8 Although the majority of the MarR

family members have been characterized as transcriptional repressors, examples of transcriptional activators have also been reported.9 Typically, the genes encoding these proteins are located in operons and share similar overall genetic organizations. As an example, the MexR protein isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a repressor of the mexAB­oprM operon, which encodes a tripartite multidrug efflux system that is mainly responsible for intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial agents of this human pathogen.10 In recent years, intensified structural investigations on MarR group members9,11­24 have allowed several distinctive features of this family to be determined. In particular, MarR proteins are homodimers that bind sequence-specific palindromic or pseudopalindromic DNA. The dimers are formed by two subunits related by a 2-fold rotational symmetry, whose association is mediated mainly by hydrophobic contacts between N-terminal and C-terminal -helices.8 The dimerization domain of each subunit is connected via a long -helix to the DNA-binding domain, which adopts a typical winged helix­turn­ helix fold. The dimeric structure shows a tweezerslike form in which the dimerization domain is the hinge of the tweezers, while the two winged helix domains are the tips.20 We recently identified a new member of the MarR family, which was isolated from the crenarchaeon

The final model consisted of 1145 nonhydrogen atoms, 108 water molecules, and 1 sulfate ion derived from the crystallization solution. All residues were well defined in the electron density maps, except for the C-terminal region (residues 140­144). The refined structure presented good geometry with root mean square deviations (rmsd) of 0.008 Å and 1.2° for ideal bond length and angle, respectively. The average temperature factor (B) for all atoms was 32.15 Å2. The stereochemical quality of the model was assessed by PROCHECK.26 The most favored and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot contained 94.6% and 5.4%, respectively, of nonglycine residues. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Overall structure BldR adopts the typical fold of the MarR family members, which consists of six -helices and a three-stranded -sheet (121342356 topology) (Fig. 1). It forms a biologically relevant dimer with a molecule related by a crystallographic 2-fold rotation axis (Fig. 2). Interaction between the two monomers in the dimer is very extensive, with a buried surface at the dimer interface of 5448.5 Å2. The structure of each subunit in the dimer can be divided into two functional domains: a dimerization domain and a DNA-binding domain. The dimerization domain is formed by helices 1, 5, and 6, which are intertwined with the same region of the other subunit (helices 1, 5, and 6). In particular, helix 1 of one monomer runs antiparallel with 6 and perpendicular to 5 and 1 of the other monomer. Polar residues of helix 1 establish strong polar interactions with residues of both dimerization domain (Thr13OG1-Asn133 OD1 = 3.41 Å; Asp121OD2-Arg138NH2 = 2.53 Å) and DNA-binding domain (Gln9OE1-Lys44

Sulfolobus sulfataricus.25 This 144-residue protein, named BldR, represents the first example of a MarR group member to be functionally characterized in Archaea as a transcriptional activator involved in the detoxification of aromatic compounds.25 In particular, transcriptional and translational analyses, together with footprinting experiments, suggested that by binding to its own promoter, BldR is able to induce autoactivation and increase the level of a coexpressed putative drug efflux transporter, while by binding to the Sso2536 promoter, this protein stimulates accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme and, hence, the enzyme-catalyzed conversion of aldehydes into less toxic alcohols.25 These studies also demonstrated that benzaldehyde, the substrate of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, stimulates DNA binding at both promoters by functioning as a positive effector ligand.25 To provide the first detailed description of the molecular determinants present in an archaeal activator of the MarR family responsible for its binding to DNA, we undertook a structural study on BldR. In particular, here we report its X-ray crystal structure, together with a molecular modeling study on the complex formed by BldR with its cognate DNA sequence.

A large number of hydrophobic interactions also contribute to the stabilization of the dimeric association. The DNA-binding domain is connected to the dimerization domain through helix 2. It comprises 1, 3, 4, 2, and 3 secondary structure elements and adopts a winged helix­turn­helix fold, which is

a well-established DNA-binding motif found in a number of transcriptional regulators (Fig. 1). Helices 3 and 4 form the HTH motif that should interact with target DNA from a major groove side, while the two anti-parallel -strands (2 and 3) form a -hairpin referred to as the wing. This 17residue wing provides a highly positive surface (five arginines and one lysine for 17 residues) responsible for maintaining nonspecific BldR­

563 modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The specific binding sites of BldR on its own promoter were previously identified by DNaseI footprinting experiments,25 which showed, in particular, that the protein protected on its promoter an extended region of about 56 bp (positions - 92 to - 37 with respect to the transcription start site). The high structural similarity between the unbound forms of BldR and BsOhrR dimers (rmsd of 3.0 Å for the superposition of 261 corresponding C atoms) (Fig. 4) suggests that these proteins cover a DNA region of almost the same length. Thus, the wider extension of the DNA protection performed by BldR on its promoter could be due to the presence of two adjacent binding sites with different binding affinities, as already observed for other archaeal transcriptional regulators27 and for BldR binding to the Sso2536 promoter.28 Inspection of the nucleotide sequence within the critical binding region allowed us to identify an almost perfect inverted-repeat motif (AGAGTTTAAAAATT-AATTTATTATAAAG from -67 to - 40) as the primary binding site for BldR. The BldR­DNA complex was then built using as DNA starting conformation the DNA structure of the BsOhrR­DNA complex,11 where all bases were mutated with those of our newly identified binding site. By contrast, two different starting conformations were utilized for the BldR dimer: the first was derived directly from the BldR crystallographic structure, while the second was generated by performing a targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulation29 on the BldR dimer crystallographic structure and by using as target the protein backbone atom of the BsOhrR­DNA complex.11 In general, TMD accelerates the transition between two states that, when associated with large conformational rearrangements, are not observable on timescales achievable with a canonical MD simulation by adding an additional term to the energy function based on the mass-weighted rmsd of a set of atoms in the current structure compared to a target reference structure.29 In the present case, the choice of the template was based on the similar fold shared by the two proteins in their unbound states (see the text above) and on the availability of the crystal structures of both unbound and DNAbound forms of the BsOhrR protein.11 The strategy

DNA interactions used for DNA minor groove binding, as discussed in detail in Molecular Modeling Studies of the BldR­DNA Complex. In contrast to what is observed for other MarR family members,12 the two DNA-binding domains of the BldR dimer do not interact with each other (Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows the structure-based sequence alignment of BldR with other archaeal family members whose crystallographic structure has been determined to date, namely, ST1710 from Sulfolobus tokadaii strain 7, also called StEmrR,22,24 MTH313 from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (MtMarR),23 and PH1061 from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (Ph1061).17 Two bacterial members of the family, namely OhrR from Bacillus subtilis (BsOhrR)11 and MarR from E. coli (EcMarR),12 have also been included in the alignment for comparison. Careful analysis of this figure reveals that all these proteins present a substantial degree of three-dimensional similarity, particularly for elements taking part in the DNA-binding domain. The most important differences, as previously reported for other members of the MarR family, are observed in the dimerization domain and are mainly due to the different lengths of helices 1 and 6 and to insertions between 5 and 6. Only three residues, all located in the DNAbinding domain, are strictly conserved in all sequences (Fig. 3). Intriguingly, even though the DNA binding properties of EcMarR are negatively regulated by salicylate, while this molecule does not have any affect on BldR (data not shown), most of the residues that are involved in salicylate binding12 in the bacterial homologue (Ala70, Thr72, and Arg86) are also conserved in BldR. Molecular modeling studies of the BldR­DNA complex The crystal structure of the transcriptional regulator BsOhrR complexed with the ohrA operator with a 28-bp duplex11 represents the sole crystallographic information available to date on the DNAbinding mechanism of a MarR family member. Thus, to provide insights into the molecular features responsible for the ability of BldR to bind DNA sequences, the molecular model of BldR, in complex with its DNA target, was built by homology

564 of using two different starting points for MD simulations was followed to achieve a sort of "bracketing" of possible binding modes, where the approach starting from the BldR crystal structure involved the right protein sequence but in a conformation not optimized for DNA binding, while the model obtained by TMD started from an optimized DNAbinding conformation but corresponded to a "wrong" protein sequence. Thus, the former approach could fail to provide a fully optimized protein­DNA interaction network, identifying wrong interaction interfaces, while the latter could be trapped in a binding mode that is stable but suboptimal for the modeled BldR­DNA complex. Two comparative MD simulations were carried out on the two different BldR­DNA complexes. Comparative analysis of the models obtained with the two modeling approaches shows that within a substantial similarity in both overall structures (rmsd value of 2.19 Å on backbone atoms of BldR dimer) and DNA-binding patterns (Fig. 5), subtle differences and preferences can be identified

between the two models. In particular, while the surface regions involved in intermolecular interactions in protein and DNA are well conserved, the fine details of intermolecular contacts show a larger number of unspecific (i.e., involving protein and/or DNA backbone atoms) interactions in the model deriving from TMD simulation versus a richer pattern of specific (i.e., side chain­side chain) contacts in the model obtained from the BldR X-ray structure as starting conformation. The latter model also exhibits a lower distortion of its secondary structure, in particular when helix 5 is considered. In view of all these features, the model derived from the BldR crystal structure is considered below. Careful analysis of this model reveals that, as observed for BsOhrR, BldR dimer contacts DNA through recognition helices 4, located within two consecutive major grooves and winged -strands, that interact with the minor grooves (Fig. 6). Moreover, each BldR monomer forms specific interactions with both DNA strands (Fig. 7). As these interactions are almost symmetric between the two BldR monomers, in the

Contacts are represented by halftransparent rectangles, shown in shades of magenta for the complex derived from BldR X-ray structure and in green for the model obtained from TMD. Color intensity varies from null to full according to an interresidue distance scale ranging from 6 to 3 Å. Thanks to the use of complementary colors for the two models, overlapping contacts appear in pure gray when distance ranges coincide in the two complexes, or in gray with magenta/green dominance when shorter distances occur in X-ray/TMD-derived models, respectively.

565 the strongest unspecific H-bonds involve Met53, Val54, Thr63, and Val92. Asn26 and Asn27 form halfspecific intermolecular H-bonds with DNA in only one BldR subunit. Interestingly, most of the residues responsible for the interactions with DNA are conserved in StEmrR (see Fig. 3), the closest homologue of BldR, while only one of these residues, namely, Arg89, is strictly conserved in all the archaeal proteins. Figure 8 reports the structural superposition of the bound and unbound forms of the BldR dimer. Careful analysis of this figure reveals that the binding to DNA does not cause a significant structural rearrangement in the protein either in the monomeric conformation or in the dimeric conformation. Indeed, the superposition of the C atoms of residues from both subunits gives an rmsd of 1.2 Å. This finding shows that, differently from BsOhrR11 and the majority of ligand-free MarR structures solved to date, except for HucR20 and OhrR from Xanthomonas campestris, 9 BldR adopts in its unbound form a conformation preconfigured to bind DNA.

Discussion
What little is known of the molecular determinants of transcriptional activation in Archaea essentially derives from studies on Ptr2 from Methanococcus jannaschi, its Lrp ortholog from Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus,30,31 and Sta1 from Sulfolobus islandicus.5 In all these cases, it has been suggested that the activating effect of these DNA-binding proteins could be generated by enhancing the recruitment of TBP and/or TFB to the promoter or by stabilizing their binding. 5,30,31 BldR is a newly identified MarR homologue that has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator in the stress response to aromatic compounds in Sulfolobus

following description, only the contacts formed by one BldR subunit will be discussed, except in the case of local asymmetries. In particular, the Ser65 side chain acts with DNA as both donor (THY18/ strand A) and acceptor (ADE10/strand B) of Hbonds (Fig. 7), which are stable throughout the last 2.5 ns of MD trajectory. The Arg90 side chain also forms stable H-bonds with DNA, although, while Arg90 of one BldR subunit forms oscillating interactions with ADE24/strand B and THY6/strand A (with 69% and 31% of occurrence), Arg90 of the other subunit stably interacts with THY24/strand A (Fig. 7). This asymmetry reflects the asymmetry in the 24th position in the nonperfectly palindromic DNA sequence used. Many other specific hydrophobic interactions between the protein and DNA are also present, as clearly shown in Fig. 5. Finally, the BldR­DNA complex is further stabilized by a network of half-specific (i.e., involving BldR side chains and DNA phosphosugar backbone or BldR backbone and DNA bases) or unspecific (i.e., backbone­backbone) intermolecular H-bonds. The strongest half-specific interactions involve Arg19, Lys23, Thr63, Gln64, Thr68, Arg82, Arg89, and Arg90, while

solfataricus.25 Since recent studies have reported that BldR-specific binding sites on its own and Sso2536 promoter sequences are located immediately upstream of the TATA box, it is reasonable to hypothesize that this protein may utilize an activation mechanism similar to that of the archaeal activators reported above. Recently, great interest has been devoted to defining the structural properties of MarR family members since they contribute significantly to microorganism multidrug resistance, which is considered a worldwide problem. However, even though significant progress has recently been made, little is known concerning the DNA-binding mechanism of these proteins. The unique detailed structural information on this topic was provided by the resolution of the crystallographic structure of BsOhrR in complex with its operator.11 BldR differs from BsOhrR since it activates rather than represses gene expression. Thus, to provide the first structural information on the DNA-binding mechanism of an activator of the MarR family, we solved the crystallographic structure of BldR at 1.90 Å resolution, and we used it as a starting point for a molecular modeling study on the BldR­DNA adduct. Analysis of the X-ray structure revealed that, in agreement with gel-filtration analysis,25 BldR is a dimer. Our studies further demonstrated that this protein adopts the typical MarR fold and presents a high degree of structural

homology, especially in the DNA-binding domains, with other archaeal MarR homologues whose crystallographic structures have been solved. However, local differences were observed both in the length and in the composition of the secondary structure elements of the dimerization domain. These differences reflect a different reciprocal orientation of the DNA-binding domains within the corresponding dimers and could be, in turn, responsible for the versatile regulatory roles of these proteins. MD simulation studies reported herein allowed us to clarify the molecular determinants responsible for BldR affinity and specificity for its associated DNA sequence. In particular, the BldR dimer contacts DNA by using recognition helices 4, which are positioned within two consecutive DNA major grooves, and winged -strands, which interact with minor grooves. Two residues responsible for binding specificity, namely, Ser65 and Arg90, were also identified. Interestingly, structural comparison of the BldR­DNA complex with its BsOhrR counterpart showed that these transcriptional regulators adopt a very similar DNA-binding mode (Fig. 9). However, while BsOhrR in its unbound form does not present a conformation that would be compatible with DNA binding, BldR seems to be structurally preconfigured to elicit this function (see Fig. 8). The observation of a strong similarity in the DNAbinding mechanism of BldR with respect to BsOhrR

is quite surprising not only due to the different kingdoms of origin of the two proteins but especially due to the different regulatory functions that they perform. Thus, this finding seems to indicate that the ability of MarR family members to act as activators or repressors is not related to a particular DNA-binding mechanism but is essentially due to the position of the specific binding site on the target DNA. This hypothesis is also supported by previously reported studies showing that several bacterial MarR family members could function as both negative and positive regulators, mainly depending on the promoter configuration and/or conformational change of the protein upon proper signaling.27 Our results imply that, despite the high structural homology, differences in the sequences of the MarR proteins may support one action rather than another. Since residues responsible for specific protein­DNA contacts are generally limited in number in these proteins, it is conceivable that single-protein mutations could lead to a change in the specificity of the binding site and/or a switch from positive to negative regulation. Given that genes encoding MarR homologues control transcription of operons, which generally encode for multisubstrate efflux pumps contributing to the microorganism's multidrug resistance, these findings could have interesting pharmacological and biotechnological applications. Indeed, in-depth knowledge of multidrug efflux system gene regulation could help identify new tools to overcome such threatening resistance.

Crystallization and data collection Native and SeMet BldR crystals were grown using the hanging-drop method by setting up 2 l of protein solution (7 mg/ml) with 2 l of reservoir solution, consisting of 2 M ammonium sulfate and 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.8). Crystals belonged to the tetragonal space group P43212 and were found to contain one molecule within their asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Elettra Synchrotron Light Source (Trieste) for native crystals and at beamline ID29 of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) for SeMet crystals. In both cases, one crystal flash cooled at 100 K from a precipitant solution containing 15% glycerol has been used for data collection. Data sets were processed using the HKL crystallographic data reduction package (Denzo/Scalepack),32 and statistics are given in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The structure of BldR was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method. Determination and refinement of the five selenium sites and phase calculations were carried out with the program SOLVE33 using data between 20.0 and 2.8 Å resolution. The initial phases were improved further with RESOLVE.34 The model of BldR was built automatically by using RESOLVE35 and optimized manually by using the program O.36 The structure was refined against the native data set using CNS.37 The final R-factor and Rfree values for all the data in the resolution range 20.00­1.90 Å were 0.201 and 0.230, respectively. Statistics of structure determination and refinement are given in Table 1. Molecular modeling of the BldR­DNA complex The crystal structure of BldR dimer was completed by addition of all hydrogen atoms and energy minimized with the SANDER module of AMBER 9 package,38 using the PARM99 force field.39 The double strand of DNA was modeled using, as template, the crystal structure of the ohrA operator complexed to the BsOhrR dimer [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1Z9C],11 opportunely replacing the 28 bp with those putatively recognized by BldR protein. All molecular simulations were performed in an aqueous solution at constant temperature (300K), constant pressure (1bar) and periodic boundary conditions. As for minimization procedure, PARM99 force field was used. Particle mesh Ewald method was applied to calculate long-range electrostatics interactions, setting the nonbonded cutoff to 12 Å. The minimized structures were confined in truncated octahedral (BldR dimer) or rectangular (BldR dimer plus DNA) boxes, fixing the minimal distance from the solute to the box wall at 1.4 nm. The boxes were filled with TIP3P water molecules and counterions (Na+ or Cl-) to neutralize the system. Solvated molecules were then energy minimized through 1000 steps, with solute atoms restrained to their starting positions using a force constant of 10 kcal mol- 1 Å- 1 prior to MD simulations. After this, the molecules

Protein expression and purification BldR was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)RIL bearing the pTrCBldR plasmid and purified as already described, with some modifications.25 A single colony was grown overnight in LB medium containing 100 g/ml ampicillin and 50 g/ml chloramphenicol, diluted 1:100, and incubated at 37 °C. BldR expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG when cells reached A600 = 1 OD and continuing growth for 16 h. Cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7) in the presence of 1 mM PMSF. The clarified lysate was thermoprecipitated by heating at 70 °C for 5 min, and the heat-treated supernatant was subjected to cation exchange chromatography (resource S; GE Healthcare) and affinity chromatography (Hi TrapHeparin; GE Healthcare). Protein homogeneity was estimated by SDS-PAGE [12.5% (wt/vol) gels]. BldR was concentrated at 3 mg/ml and frozen for storage at -20 °C in the presence of 10% glycerol. SeMet BldR was expressed in the same E. coli BL21(DE3) host strain. A single colony was grown overnight in LB containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and grown in M9 liquid medium containing 100 g/ml ampicillin, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.4% glucose, and 1 mg/ml of the vitamins riboflavin, niacinamide, thiamine, and pyridoxine monohydrate. When A600 of the culture had reached 0.5 OD, 50 g/ml leucine, isoleucine, and valine, and 100 g/ml lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine were added. Growth was

underwent 90 ps of restrained MD (5 kcal mol- 1 Å- 1) at constant volume, gradually heating to 300 K, followed by 60 ps of restrained MD (5 kcal mol- 1 Å- 1) at constant pressure to adjust system density. In the case of BldR-DNA complex, the restrains were gradually removed, by performing 1 ns with restraint on the main chains of both protein and DNA for the first 500 ps and only on the DNA backbone for the last 500 ps, to allow a full optimization of protein side-chain interactions with DNA before allowing full relaxation of the complex. TMD simulations were performed by applying a restraint force constant of 1.0 kcal mol- 1 Å- 2 and by using the backbone atom positions from BsOhrR protein dimer bound to the ohrA promoter as target reference structure. Production TMD simulations on BldR dimer alone were carried out for 2 ns with a time step of 1 fs, whereas MD simulations on BldR­DNA complex were carried out for 8 ns using a time step of 2 fs. Bonds involving hydrogens were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm.40 Snapshots from production run were saved every 1000 steps and analyzed with MOLMOL program.41 Accession numbers Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB with accession number 3F3X.
