The crystal structure of a novel sulfonyl-pyridazinone inhibitor in complex with aldose reductase, the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, has been ° ° determined to 1.43 A and 0.95 A resolution. The ternary complex of inhibitor, cofactor and enzyme has been obtained by soaking of preformed crystals. Supposedly due to low solubility in the crystallisation buffer, in both structures the inhibitor shows reduced occupancy of 74% and 46% population, respectively. The pyridazinone head group of the inhibitor occupies the catalytic site, whereas the chloro-benzofuran moiety penetrates into the opened specificity pocket. The high-resolution structure provides some evidence that the pyridazinone group binds in a negatively charged deprotonated state, whereas the neighbouring His110 residue most likely adopts a neutral uncharged status. Since the latter structure is populated by the ligand to only 46%, a second conformation of the C-terminal ligand-binding region can be detected. This conformation corresponds to the closed state of the specificity pocket when no or only small ligands are bound to aldose reductase. The two conformational states are in good agreement with frames observed along a molecular dynamics trajectory describing the transition from closed to open situation. Accordingly, both geometries, superimposed in the averaged crystal structure, correspond to snapshots of the ligand-bound and the unbound state. Isothermal titration calorimetry has been applied to determine the binding constants of the investigated pyridazinone in comparison to the hydantoin sorbinil and the carboxylate-type inhibitors IDD 594 and tolrestat. The pyridazinone exhibits a binding affinity similar to those of tolrestat and sorbinil, and shows slightly reduced affinity compared to IDD 594. These studies elucidating the binding mode and providing information about protonation states of protein side-chains involved in binding of this novel class of inhibitors establish the platform for further structurebased drug design.

Aldose reductase (ALR2; EC 1.1.1.21) is a 36 kDa TIM-barrel-shaped aldo-keto reductase catalysing the reaction of a broad range of carbonylcontaining substrates to their corresponding alcohols using NADPH as cofactor for reduction.1 Even though the physiological function of ALR2 is not completely understood, the enzyme might play a

46 role as detoxifier of various aldehydes produced under conditions of cellular oxidative stress. Representatives of such substrates are, e.g. 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, methylglyoxal as well as their glutathionylated derivatives.1,2 However, under diabetic conditions accompanied by high cellular levels of glucose, ALR2 is responsible for an enhanced reduction of glucose to sorbitol. In particular, ALR2 is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the polyol pathway converting glucose to sorbitol followed by the subsequent NADC-dependent oxidation of sorbitol to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. As a consequence, enhanced flux of glucose through the polyol pathway leads to various imbalances with respect to reduction equivalents responsible for oxidative and oxidative-nitrosative stress, osmotic stress, cytokine signalling, regulation of apoptosis as well as activation of kinase cascades.3­5 Altogether, the pathophysiological activity of aldose reductase plays a key role in the development of diabetic complications such as angiopathy, nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and cataract formation.6,7 In vitro and in vivo studies suggest a clear benefit of the administration of aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) in various model systems exposed to high levels of glucose as well as in the treatment of diabetic patients.5,8­14 Encouraged by these observations, extensive efforts have been made within the last two decades to develop appropriate drug candidates. A broad variety of agents inhibiting ALR2 have been synthesized or extracted from natural sources.9 However, for various reasons, most of these inhibitors failed in clinical trials.7,10 The first clinically investigated candidate, sorbinil, a hydantoin-type inhibitor (Figure 1, 1), led to the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions independent of the ALR2 inhibition. The carboxylic acid-type inhibitors show a remarkable in vitro affinity but

lack sufficient in vivo efficiency due to poor bioavailability. Representatives of carboxylic acid inhibitors are depicted in Figure 1 (2, IDD 594; 3, tolrestat). It seems to be generally accepted in the literature that the decreased in vivo potency is a consequence of the low pKa of the carboxylic acid inhibitors (between 3 and 4) which will be ionized almost completely under physiological conditions. Thus, reduced penetration through biological membranes can be expected.7,10 In contrast, hydantoin ARIs exhibit a pKa of about 8; accordingly, much better potency to cross biological barriers is given due to their essentially uncharged state in aqueous solution. The most promising members of ARIs, the hydantoin fidarestat, and the cyclic imide minalrestat (Figure 1, 4 and 5, respectively) are currently in pre-clinical or clinical trials.11­13,15,16,17 In 2003, Mylari et al. reported on the development of a novel non-carboxylic acid, non-hydantoin inhibitor with excellent properties: the compound shows a sub-nanomolar IC50 value (840 pM), a more than 1000-fold selectivity advantage for aldose reductase compared to aldehyde reductase, an almost perfect oral bioavailability as well as a pronounced in vivo efficiency.12 The ligand consists of a benzofuran moiety, a pyridazinone scaffold, and a sulfonyl group linking these components together (Figure 1, 6). The pKa of the titratable pyridazinone and the log P of the inhibitor were determined to 6.9 and 3.05, respectively, one prerequisite for good tissue penetration behaviour. Here, we describe two crystal structures of the ternary complex of ALR2 in complex with the ° ° pyridazinone 6 refined to 1.43 A and 0.95 A. As determined previously, the overall topology of the enzyme comprises an (b/a)8-TIM-barrel with the active site located at the C-terminal region of the protein facilitating binding of charged ligands (in the present case, NADPC and inhibitors) possibly stabilized via helix-induced dipole

moments.15,18 The deeply buried binding pocket is comprised by residues presumably involved in catalysis (Tyr48, Lys77, His110), the nicotinamide moiety of NADPC and Trp111 likely donating an H bond via its indole portion to most of the described ligand head groups, and hydrophobic contacts formed by the side-chains of Trp20, Val47, Trp79, and Trp219. The part of the binding pocket composed of the residues involved in catalysis is usually addressed by hydrophilic, negatively charged building blocks such as carboxylic acids or deprotonated hydantoins. Inhibitors decorated at the opposing terminal end by appropriate hydrophobic groups showed partially the potential to open distinct pockets referred to as specificity pockets. These adaptable pockets are formed by Leu300, Trp111 and Phe122. The present study elucidates the binding mode between aldose reductase and the novel pyridazinone inhibitor 6. Furthermore, we determined the standard Gibbs free energy of binding by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and compared the binding properties of 6 with those of the known ARIs 1­3.

Results and Discussion
X-ray crystallography ° The final model (1.43 A resolution) of a ternary complex of human ALR2 (316 residues) with bound coenzyme NADPC and pyridazinone inhibitor 6 shows a (b/a)8 barrel fold frequently adopted by enzymes.15­18 During refinement, split conformations have been assigned to seven amino acid residues (Glu60, Gln93, Glu120, Glu193, Glu267, Ser282 and Arg293). The electron density maps clearly show the location of the cofactor and the inhibitor. The FoKFc density (3 s) of the inhibitor is shown in Figure 2. Even though clear-cut electron density was observed for the inhibitor, after assignment of the inhibitor atoms with full population to ° the model, negative electron density (K0.28 e/A3 corresponding to 4.2 s) resulted from refinement in close proximity to the chlorine atom of the inhibitor. We therefore decided to refine the occupancy of the ligand resulting in 74% presence. The inhibitor occupies the active site of the enzyme with its pyridazinone moiety present in the partly polar anion-binding pocket composed by the catalytic residues Tyr48, Lys77 and His110. The benzofuran system opens the hydrophobic "specificity" pocket formed by Trp111, Phe122, and Leu300. Ligands occupying this specificity pocket of ALR2 have been shown to induce unfavourable rearrangements in aldehyde reductase (ALR1, EC 1.1.1.2) including, e.g. the rupture of the salt-bridge between Arg312 and Asp313. This might explain, to some extent, the high level of selectivity (O1000-fold)12 of the studied ligand towards ALR2 in comparison to ALR1. Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of the binding pocket and the interaction mode between the ligand and the enzyme­cofactor

The inhibitor is depicted in dark blue with the corresponding FoKFc density contoured at a level of 3 s. The coordinating water molecule is shown as a red sphere. The difference electron density indicates clearly how the inhibitor is accommodated in the active site of ALR2 with its benzofuran moiety occupying the specificity pocket between Leu300 and Trp111, and the pyridazinone anchor hosting the catalytic site.

complex. The aromatic pyridazinone moiety binds in a face-to-face orientation with respect to the nicotinamide moiety of the cofactor. Even though the density corresponding to the pyridazinone head group does not allow unique assignment of the orientation of the heterocycle with both nitrogen atoms to the same or opposing side with respect to the sulfonyl group, we suggest that the nitrogen atoms point towards Trp111 adopting optimal geometry to form an H bond between the sidechain NH of Trp111 and N2 of the ligand with a ° contact distance of 3.2 A. In alternative orientation, a similar interaction to the Trp20 NH would not be possible for geometric reasons. An essential prerequisite to form our assumed interaction mode is the binding of the pyridazinone in the deprotonated state at N2 to the enzyme. In addition, binding in the deprotonated state would allow the ligand to form a charge-assisted interaction between its negatively charged pyridazinone anchor and the positively charged nicotinamide moiety of NADPC ° (w3.3 A). Although no information about protonation states can be gleaned from the electron density ° at the available resolution (1.43 A; for further details, see below), His110 N32 and Tyr48 OH are ° in perfect orientation and contact distance (2.7 A) to act as H bond donors to the carbonyl O3 oxygen of the pyridazinone (Table 1). Additionally, the pyridazinone group forms an arene-sulfur contact to Cys298 and edge-to-face interactions to the aromatic side-chain of Trp20. The sulfonyl spacer fixes both aromatic systems enclosing a bond angle of 101.68. This provides an ideal geometry to address both, the catalytic and the specificity

pocket. The rigid scaffold might contribute to binding affinity of this ligand: exhibiting only two rotatable bonds, the inhibitor cannot lose pronounced conformational degrees of freedom upon binding to the enzyme. The sulfonyl group remains partly solvent exposed with its O1 oxygen of the sulfon group forming an H bond to a water molecule. The benzofuran system forms a face-toface p­p stacking interaction to the aromatic sidechain of Trp111, hydrophobic contacts to the sidechains of Leu300 as well as to Trp79 and Phe122. Furthermore, arene­sulfur interactions between the thiol group of Cys80 and Cys303, and the aromatic benzofuran are observed. In total, there are 109 van der Waals contacts between the ligand and the ALR2­NADPC complex. Upon complex formation, protein (including the cofactor) and ligand bury ° a solvent-accessible surface area of 636 A2, which ° can be split into a minor polar (138 A2) and an ° almost four times larger apolar (498 A2) surface contribution. The relationship is in agreement with previous studies suggesting hydrophobic interactions as an important driving force for the binding process.19,20 To obtain more detailed insights into the binding mode of the pyridazinone to ALR2 we determined ° the same complex structure at 0.95 A resolution. The model was refined to a final Rcryst and Rfree of 12.2% and 14.2%, respectively. Interestingly enough, besides the assignment of 22 split conformations, the electron density indicates the presence of two different loop conformations next to the C-terminal ligand-binding region (residues 299­303) (Figure 4). After fitting a split model, the occupancy could be refined to 54% and 46% for both loop conformations. Conformation 1 represents the specificity pocket of the enzyme in its closed geometry, forming direct hydrophobic contacts between the side-chains of Leu300 and Trp111.

These residues adopt similar conformations in ligand-bound states if the accommodated inhibitor leaves the specificity pocket unoccupied, as observed in the case offidarestat21 or in complexes formed with citrate as ligand in the catalytic pocket.22 Conformation 2 corresponds to the open form of the specificity pocket hosting the benzofuran moiety of the ligand. An even better-resolved structure of the ternary ALR2­NADPC­IDD 594 complex has been ° refined recently to 0.66 A.15 The inhibitor IDD 594 (Figure 1, 2) opens the specificity pocket very similar ° to the pyridazinone 6 (rmsd 0.15 and 0.81 A, calculated for either the backbone atoms of the residues Trp111, Thr113, Phe122, Ala299, Leu300, Leu301 and Ser302 or for all atoms of these residues, respectively). In addition to the binding site conformations observed in the ALR2­NADPC complexes with IDD 594 and citrate/fidarestat, a third conformer has been found in the complex with tolrestat:23

49 represents the specificity pocket in closed state, adopting very similar side-chain orientations except for Cys298 and Leu300, where slightly different rotamers are observed. In the fidarestat complex, both split side-chain rotamers place the CH2S-group towards the nicotinamide moiety of the cofactor, whereas in our complex structure this side-chain is directed in one of the two split orientations towards the cofactor and in the second towards the pyridazinone inhibitor. The backbone trace of conformation 2 coincides with that observed for the IDD 594 complex ° (rmsd 0.12 A). Slight deviations are observed for the rotameric state of the solvent-exposed Leu301 sidechain, whereas the geometry of the remaining binding pocket is retained. Compared to the complexes with IDD 594, fidarestat and 6, remarkable relocations within the C-terminal loop region are observed for the tolrestat complex. For the latter, rmsd ° ° values of 5.53 A and 5.85 A with respect to the backbone trace and all residue atoms, respectively, are determined for Cys298 to Cys303 when compared ° to conformation 2 found in the 0.95 A ALR2­6 complex. Whereas IDD 594 and 6 form face-to-face p­p stacking interactions to Trp111, the aromatic portion of tolrestat is oriented perpendicularly, forming an edge-to-face interaction with Trp111. Simultaneously, the side-chain of Leu300 adopts a kinked conformation forming a van der Waals contact to the naphthyl moiety of tolrestat. The trifluoromethyl substituent is located in a region actually occupied in the IDD 594 and the ALR2-6 complexes by one of the Cd atoms of Leu300. As a consequence of this adaptation, the aromatic portion of tolrestat intercalates between the side-chains Leu300 and Phe122 with the latter shifted towards Val47 compared to its orientation present in the IDD 594, fidarestat and 6 complexes. The atomic positions of the carboxylic groups in IDD 594 and tolrestat superimpose well with N2, C3, and O3 of the pyridazinone moiety in the ALR2-6 complex. Since binding of 6 requires opening of the specificity pocket, the occupancy of the inhibitor was set equivalent to the occupancy of the open loop conformation 2, ° which refined to a 46% population in the 0.95 A structure. It remains unclear why a higher ligand ° population has been found in the 1.43 A structure, possibly this is due to a difference in ligand soaking time. Nevertheless, the corresponding FoKFc difference map (3.5 s) clearly reveals the atomic positions of the inhibitor. A representation of the ° binding mode, as observed in the 0.95 A crystal structure, is given in Figure 6. The data do not allow us to conclude whether, in agreement with conformation 1, a citrate molecule, picked up from the crystallisation buffer, is present to some extent in the active site. However, no significant density could be detected that would indicate the presence of a wellordered citrate molecule in the catalytic pocket. Obviously, our high-resolution structure shows an averaged superposition of the specificity pocket in the closed state or the open state. Both geometries can be regarded as frozen-in snapshots of the conformational adaptation required to accommodate

Figure 4. Refinement model of the C-terminal ligandbinding region exhibiting two split conformations; the one shown in grey corresponds to the geometry with closed specificity pocket between Leu300 and Trp111 (not shown) and the second conformation, shown in orange, describes the open specificity pocket ready to accommodate the bound ligand. The FoKFc density (2.0 s) is indicated in blue.

A detailed comparison of the crystal structures corresponding to these three conformers reveals that the architecture of the binding site next to the catalytic centre and the cofactor location is virtually conserved, but pronounced induced-fit adaptations are observed for the C-terminal loop region (Cys298 to Cys303) and the aromatic side-chain of Phe122 lining up the specificity pockets. In Figure 5, a superposition of these binding pockets together with their bound inhibitors is shown. The backbone trace of conformation 1 in our novel complex structure and the fidarestat complex superimpose ° well (rmsd 0.16 A). Accordingly, this conformation

the bound ligand. Previous molecular dynamics simulations24 indicated that access to the specificity pocket requires relocation of the side-chain together with important backbone atom shifts in this loop region. Table 2 shows the f and j angles corresponding to the open and closed loop conformations, and the observed changes required for opening the pocket. Pronounced differences in Df and Dj are observed for Ala299 (77.38, 140.98) and Leu300 (161.48, 64.08). To quantify backbone atom shifts, Table 2 lists the distances of the Ca atoms for the residues involved in opening the specificity pocket. Remarkable differences are observed for Leu300 and Leu301 being displaced ° ° by 2.6 A and 2.5 A, respectively. Thus, significant contributions to the opening of the specificity pocket result from extended backbone atom movements. Table 1 lists important interaction distances between the inhibitor and the ALR2­ NADPC complex. Whereas in our crystal structure ° at 1.43 A resolution only one water molecule was found to coordinate to the solvent-exposed O1 ° oxygen of the inhibitor (distance 3.0 A), in the ° 0.95 A structure two water molecules are observed ° ° next to O1 at distances of 2.7 A and 3.0 A.

To assign H-bond donors and acceptors at the protein­inhibitor interface, knowledge about the actually adopted protonation states is an essential prerequisite. Therefore, we used the high-resolution data for the calculation of a FoKFc difference map neglecting all hydrogen atoms possibly bonded to Tyr48, Lys77, His110 and Trp111 (Figure 7). The difference density map obtained suggests protonation at N32 of His110, H-bonded to the carbonyl O3 oxygen of the inhibitor. Furthermore, a density peak close to N31 of Trp111 is observed next to a straight line connecting the latter nitrogen atom with N2 of the inhibitor. This observation suggests protonation of the indole moiety of Trp111, and supports our hypothesis that the pyridazinone inhibitor binds to the enzyme in a deprotonated state. Additionally, the difference electron density provides evidence for a protonated Tyr48 hydroxyl function acting as H bond donor to O3 of the inhibitor. The oxygen atom of this hydroxyl function is accepting at the same time an H bond donated by the threefold protonated Lys77. As in the present structure, in several ALR2 crystal structures a water molecule has been found to coordinate to Nd2 of His110 and to mediate an interaction to Lys77. With respect to this site, an interesting feature has been described by El-Kabbani et al.25 They observed a similar ° electron density peak near His110 in a 0.92 A and a ° 1.1 A resolved crystal structure of human ALR2 complexed by either the hydantoin fidarestat (4) or minalrestat (5). Due to an anomalous diffraction signal in the case of fidarestat, this density peak has been interpreted as 60% chloride and 40% water, whereas in the ALR2­minalrestat complex this peak has been assigned to 100% water occupancy. In our high-resolution crystal structure we also observe difference electron density that can be attributed to a water molecule. However, we do not gain evidence for any additional density that might indicate partial occupancy by a chloride ion at this site. In our structure, near the water we detect two difference electron density peaks at 2.0 s which, with some care, might be interpreted as the hydrogen atoms of the water molecule pointing towards Nd2 of His110 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of Lys77. Thus, both neighbouring groups act as H bond acceptors. Furthermore, this tetra-coordinated water molecule accepts H bonds from the backbone NH groups of His46 and Val47.

Figure 7. The FoKFc difference map next to residues in the catalytic center provides evidence for the protonation states of Tyr48, Lys77, His110, Trp111 and the pyridazinone moiety. Furthermore, a water molecule is indicated mediating a hydrogen bond network to His110 Nd2, Lys77 CO and the backbone NH groups of His46 and Val47. H bonds are shown as dotted green lines and the electron density corresponding to the hydrogen atoms is contoured in blue at 1.8 s. The inhibitor is shown in blue. The representation presents the binding pocket in two orientations: (a) the H bond interactions between the inhibitor and Tyr48 OH, His 110N32 and Trp111 N31; (b) clearly shows the threefold protonated Lys77 side-chain nitrogen atom involved in an H-bond network to Tyr48 OH, Asp43 Od2 and Cys44 CO.

° Its B-factor (5.1 A2) corresponds approximately to ° the B-factors of the coordinating groups (4.7 A2 on average), which supports the hypothesis of full occupancy by a water molecule. According to these observations, we suggest His110 to be singly protonated at N32 as described for the carboxylic acid-type inhibitor IDD 594. The supposedly deprotonated nature of N2 in 6 in the enzymebound state suggests either a negative charge on this ligand or a possible hydroxypyridazine tautomer. Close analysis of the binding pattern gives no evidence for a putative interaction of an assumed hydroxyl group at this position for the latter tautomer with any neighbouring group of the protein. Furthermore, unrestrained refinement of ° the C3­O3 bond length results in 1.19(G0.02) A, clearly indicating the presence of a carbonyl double bond. These observations make the presence of the hydroxypyridazine tautomer unlikely. A further interesting detail concerns the electrostatic polarisation between the 5-chloro substituent at the benzofuran moiety in the specificity pocket and Og of Thr113. A similar contact has been described between a bromine ion and Thr113 Og for the ALR2­IDD 594 complex. Multipolar refinement of the diffraction data on the latter complex along with theoretical DFT calculations26,27 suggest negative polarisation of Og involved in an H bond to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the same residue. The partial negative charge of Og polarises the neighbouring IDD 594 bromine substituent, resulting in an unusually short bromine­oxygen contact of ° 2.97 A. This induced electrostatic interaction is assumed to contribute to the affinity and selectivity of IDD 594. The 5-chlorosubstituent at the

benzofuran moiety of 6 occupies approximately the same position as the bromine ion in IDD 594. This fact suggests that similar polarisation effects could possibly matter in the ALR2­6 complex, even though a chlorine ion shows reduced polarisability in comparison to a bromine ion. Closest intermolecular contacts between an alcohol-type oxygen atom and chlorine bound to an aromatic nucleus are found in small-molecule crystal structures in the ° range of 2.96­2.99 A. (Cambridge crystallographic data base. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center; 2003. A CSD search was carried out according to the instructions of the supplier using a chloro-phenyl- and a Csp3 hydroxyl group as search fragments followed by visual inspection of the hits.) In our complex, this ° ° Og­Cl contact amounts to 3.6 A and 3.5 A for the ° and 0.95 A crystal structure, respectively. ° 1.43 A The larger distance could either be attributed to lower polarisability of the chlorine or additionally to a non-optimal interaction geometry experienced by the chlorine in 6: whereas in the crystal structure of IDD 594 the bromine atom points directly towards Thr113 Og, in 6, the chlorine is slightly off and orients towards the bottom of the pocket. Isothermal titration calorimetry to determine binding constants The pyridazinone inhibitor investigated in this study is described as one of the most potent ARIs yet reported,12 based on in vitro IC50 values and in vivo dose­response data. In order to compare binding affinity towards ALR2 of 6 with other known ARIs in terms of a pure dissociation constant

independent of any superimposed effects resulting from a kinetic enzyme assay, we applied isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Titration experiments were performed for 6, IDD 594, sorbinil and tolrestat with human ALR2 in the presence of NADPC. In structural terms, sorbinil binds to the catalytic pocket of ALR2 without opening the specificity pocket, whereas IDD 594 and tolrestat both open and occupy this pocket, however, as already described, in different fashion. IDD 594, sorbinil, and tolrestat show binding constants of 4.5!106 to 1.5!107 l/mol. Unlike 1­3, 6 is almost insoluble in 10 mM Hepes buffer at pH 8, even after extensive sonication, when no further pre-treatment of the compound was carried out. However, lyophilisation of 6 dissolved previously in DMSO resulted in a powder that is soluble up to 150 mM under the conditions used for the thermodynamic measurements. We determined a binding constant for 6 of 1.1!106 l/mol corresponding to a standard Gibbs free energy of 34.5 kJ/mol. This value is lower than that of IDD 594 and falls into the range found for sorbinil and tolrestat (Table 3). The binding constant observed for 6 by ITC is lower than expected, considering the reported IC50 value; however, these values are difficult to compare, as the latter might be affected by various parameters such as enzyme concentration, pH and nature of the buffer, salt content, substrate, substrate concentration and cofactor concentrations used in the kinetic assay. Nevertheless, compared to the carboxylate-type and the hydantoin-type inhibitors, the in vivo efficiency obviously benefits from the improved physicochemical properties of 6, giving rise to higher tissue penetration due to increased lipophilicity.

Conclusions
To prevent diabetic complications caused by enhanced glucose flux via the polyol pathway, aldose reductase inhibition provides a promising therapeutic principle to adjust cellular imbalances under pathophysiological high-glucose conditions. Up to now, most of the carboxylate-type and hydantoin-type ARIs developed during the last two decades have failed in clinical trials, probably due to insufficient physicochemical or selectivity properties. In 2003, a novel ARI showing a pyridazinone anchor group was reported to possess

excellent affinity and tissue penetration properties. The crystal structure of the ternary complex of this pyridazinone inhibitor with ALR2­NADPC has ° ° been determined at 1.43 A and 0.95 A resolution. The inhibitor binds with its pyridazinone head group to the catalytic center and occupies the selectivity pocket using its benzofuran moiety. Due to the partial occupancy of the inhibitor in the high-resolution structure, our analysis gives evidence for two loop conformations involved in the opening of the specificity pocket. Previously performed molecular dynamics simulations indicated this opening as a concerted movement of backbone atoms as well as side-chain rotations. Soaking times applied to the crystals used for the ° ° 0.95 A and 1.43 A resolution structure determination were different. The shorter ligand soak applied for the crystal in the high-resolution analysis resulted in only 46% inhibitor occupancy, whereas the other showed 74%. Nevertheless, both structures exhibit virtually the same binding geometry. Difference electron density of the ° 0.95 A data provides some evidence that the pyridazinone moiety binds deprotonated and negatively charged, whereas the neighbouring Tyr48 and His110 residues are present in an uncharged state. Furthermore, we determined the binding constant of the pyridazinone inhibitor by ITC to fall into the affinity range of the known inhibitors sorbinil and tolrestat. Even though the inhibitor has been described to possess excellent pharmacokinetic properties, further improvement of the affinity would be desirable. Its poor solubility under the applied crystallisation conditions is probably responsible for the incomplete occupancies after soaking. In the case of 1­3, similar soaking conditions always produced full occupancy. Possibly, solubility of the pyridazinonetype inhibitor has to be improved. The recently described in vitro and in vivo studies of 6 and other derivatives were carried out in the presence of DMSO to increase water solubility. With the knowledge of the detailed interaction pattern between the ligand and the enzyme, new ideas about how to improve the class of the pyridazinones should be possible. One might consider the electrostatic polarization observed for bromine in IDD 594 and Thr113 Og to enhance ligand binding to the specificity pocket. Furthermore, affinity and selectivity of AR-inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve by addressing the backbone NH of Leu300

HKL2000 package.29 Data collection and processing statistics are given in Table 4. Structure determination and refinement The coordinates of human ALR2 (PDB code 1el3)16 were used for initial rigid-body refinement of the protein atoms followed by repeated cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization, simulated annealing and B-factor refinement using the CNS program package.30 Refinement at later stages was performed with the program SHELXL.31 Here, at least 20 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization were performed with default restraints on bonding geometry and B-values: 5% of all data were used for Rfree calculation. Amino acid side-chains were fit to sA-weighted 2FoKFc and FoKFc electron density maps using O. 32 After the first refinement cycle, water molecules, and subsequently cofactor and ligand, were located in the electron density and added to the model. Anisotropic conjugate gradient refinement resulted in a significant improvement of the model built for the highresolution synchrotron data, which was not observed for ° the 1.43 A structure. Restraints were applied to bond lengths and angles, chiral volume, planarity of aromatic rings and van der Waals contacts. Multiple side-chain conformations were built if indicated by appropriate electron density and maintained during the refinement, if the minor populated side-chain rotamer showed at least 10% occupancy. During the last refinement cycles, riding H atoms were introduced for the protein residues without using additional parameters. The riding model was not applied for cofactor and inhibitor. The final models were validated using PROCHECK.33 Data refinement statistics are shown in Table 4. The van der Waals contacts have been detected by the program CONTACSYM.34 Polar and apolar solventaccessible surfaces buried upon ligand binding have been calculated with the GETAREA 1.1 web interface,35 ° using a 1.4 A probe and radii published by Shrake and Rupley.36 Figures were prepared using Isis Draw (MDL, San Leandro, USA) and Pymol. RMSD values have been calculated by means of the program suite SYBYL. Isothermal titration calorimetry Calorimetric measurements were carried out using an MCS ITC-instrument from MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, USA). In each experiment, the ligand was titrated to the protein solution present in the 1.4 ml sample cell. The reference cell contained 0.1 mM sodium azide dissolved in demineralised water. All measurements were carried out at 298 K. The protein was dissolved in 10 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8) to a concentration of 18.9 mM for the titration of 2, and 37.8 mM for the measurement of 1, 3 and 6. Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy (280 nm) using the specific absorption calculated by the ProtParam tool.37 An appropriate amount of 6 was solved in 200 ml of DMSO, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently lyophilized overnight. After resolvation, the saturation concentration of 6 was determined to be 150 mM by UV spectroscopy at 240 nm. The ligand solution contained the corresponding inhibitor at 252 mM dissolved in the same buffer as  http://www.pymol.org  SYBYL 7.0, Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO.

with an appropriate H bond acceptor.21,28 Considering the present crystal structure, such acceptor groups should possibly replace the presently attached methyl group at the benzofuran moiety. These modifications might start a subsequent cycle of iterative structure-based drug design in order to combine the beneficial pyridazinone anchor group with enhanced affinity, selectivity and solubility of the substituents.

Materials and Methods
Cloning, expression, purification and crystallization of aldose reductase have been described in detail elsewhere.15,17,18,25 Prior to crystallization, ALR2 solutions were concentrated to 20 mg/ml in 50 mM diammonium hydrogen citrate at pH 5 and mixed with a solution of the cofactor in the oxidized state to achieve a molar ratio of ALR2 to NADPC of 1:3. Crystals were grown at 277 K using the hanging-drop, vapour-diffusion method. We performed cocrystallization as well as soaking trials to obtain appropriate crystals of the complex with 6. Our attempts to cocrystallize 6 with the protein resulted in crystals that contained, as shown by structure determination, the electron density of a citrate molecule accommodated in the active site pocket. Possibly this is due to poor solubility of the pyridazinone inhibitor under these crystallization conditions. Therefore, we examined various soaking conditions resulting in a solution of 5% (v/v) isopropanol, 5% (v/v) DMSO, along with 5% (w/v) b-cyclodextrin (Sigma), 25% (w/v) PEG 6000 in 50 mM diammonium hydrogen citrate at pH 5, which was used to prepare a saturated solution of the inhibitor. Crystals were soaked at 293 K for up to three days. Data collection Data were collected at 100 K using a solution of 40% (w/v) PEG 6000 in 50 mM diammonium hydrogen citrate at pH 5 as cryoprotectant. Appropriate crystals were selected to determine a data set (soaking time three days) ° at 1.43 A on our in-house facility. A second data set, based on a crystal soaked for about two days was used for data collection at beamline BL1 of the Protein Structure Factory, BESSY synchrotron (Berlin, Germany). The in-house data set was determined with a RIGAKU copper rotating anode (Molecular Structure Cooperation) at 50 kV, 90 mA as X-ray source and an R-AXIS IV image plate system. For each frame, the exposure time and oscillation range were set to 5 min and 0.58, respectively. The BESSY data consist of a low-resolution and a highresolution pass, and were collected using an MAR-CCD detector (Marresearch, Norderstedt, Germany). Exposure time, oscillation range, detector geometry and crystal­detector distance were optimized to obtain a low-resolution data set with a resolution range of ° 15­2.5 A as well as a high-resolution data set ranging ° from 2.7­0.95 A. These sets were processed separately and subsequently mutually scaled to reveal a unique data set. The soaked crystals belong to the monoclinic space ° ° group P21 with unit cell parameters aZ49.4 A, bZ66.9 A, ° cZ47.4 A, and bZ92.18 and bZ91.98 for the in-house and BESSY data, respectively. The structure contains one monomer per asymmetric unit with a Matthews coeffi° cient of 2.2 A3/Da and 43.2% solvent content. All data processing and scaling were performed using the

the protein except in the case of 6, where, according to the solubility limitations, a ligand concentration of 135 mM was used. The protein was saturated with an excess of NADPC, which was present at the same concentration in the ligand solution to avoid heat effects caused by diluting the cofactor. Solutions were degassed at 293 K under vacuum for 10 min. Upon experimental setup, the protein solution present in the sample cell was stirred at 400 rpm. After a stable baseline had been achieved, the titration was initiated. The injection sequence started with an initial portion of 1.5 ml (to preserve diffusion effects arising from the experimental setup, data not used for fitting) followed by injections of 10 ml at intervals of 300 s until complete saturation was obtained. In the case of ligand 6, injections of 15 ml were performed instead of 10 ml. The titrated sample solution was checked for any precipitation by visual microscopic inspection. Heat changes caused by each inhibitor injection were obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. Data were analysed using the ORIGIN software (MicroCal Inc.) for fitting the data to a single-site binding model in agreement with the results from X-ray crystallography. Experimental heats of the protein-inhibitor titration were corrected for heats of dilution by subtracting the corresponding data of a blank titration (inhibitor into buffer). All measurements have been carried out at least in triplicate. Given energy values, binding constants and

standard deviations derive from data fitting and subsequent averaging of the corresponding measurements. Standard Gibbs free energy values were calculated using the equation DG0 ZKRT ln Kb , where RZ 8.3144 J molK1 KK1, and Kb is the binding constant.
