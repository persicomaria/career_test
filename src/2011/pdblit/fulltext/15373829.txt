The structure of bovine odorant-binding protein (bOBP) revealed a striking feature of a dimer formed by domain 2 swapping [Tegoni, M., Ramoni, R., Bignetti, E., Spinelli, S. & Cambillau, C. (1996) Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 863­867; Bianchet, M.A., Bains, G., Pelosi, P., Pevsner, J., Snyder, S.H., Monaco, H.L. & Amzel, L.M. (1996) Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 934­939] and the presence of a naturally occuring ligand [Ramoni, R., Vincent, F., Grolli, S., Conti, V., Malosse, C., Boyer, F.D., Nagnan-Le Meillour, P., Spinelli, S., Cambillau, C. & Tegoni, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 7150­7155]. These features led us to investigate the binding of odorant molecules with bOBP in solution and in the crystal. The behavior of odorant molecules in bOBP resembles that observed with porcine OBP (pOBP), although the latter is monomeric and devoid of ligand when purified. The odorant

molecules presented Kd values with bOBP in the micromolar range. Most of the X-ray structures revealed that odorant molecules interact with a common set of residues forming the cavity wall and do not exhibit specific interactions. Depending on the ligand and on the monomer (A or B), a single residue ­ Phe89 ­ presents alternate conformations and might control cross-talking between the subunits. Crystal data on both pOBP and bOBP, in contrast with binding and spectroscopic studies on rat OBP in solution, reveal an absence of significant conformational changes involving protein loops or backbone. Thus, the role of OBP 3 in signal triggering remains unresolved. Keywords: crystal structure; domain swapping; odorantbinding protein; olfaction.

Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), first discovered in the nasal mucus and epithelium of mammals at millimolar 4 concentrations [1,2], were identified, by their sequence, as lipocalins [3], a family of proteins generally involved in the transport of hydrophobic ligands [4]. The hypothesis of their involvement in the olfactory process, perception and transduction of the signal, was derived from their localization and their ability to bind 2-iso-butyl-3-metoxypyrazine (IBMP), known as the odorant with the lowest detection threshold in humans [5]. Different roles for OBPs have previously been proposed [6,7], such as (a) carriers of odorants from the air to the olfactory receptors (ORs) through the aqueous barrier of the mucus [11,12]; (b) scavengers of odorants from the OR after transduction of the olfactory signal [8,9] and/or of odorants present at a high concentration in order to avoid saturation of the OR [10,11]; (c) protectors of the nasal mucosa, which is exposed to airflow and oxidative injuries, by binding

cytotoxic and genotoxic molecules, such as alkylic aldehydes [9,12,13]; or (d) during transduction, to permit recognition of the OBP­odorant complex by the receptor, 5 as in bacterial chemotaxis [14,15]. Indeed, a broad spectrum of activity and a relatively weak affinity for odorants have been found in mammalian OBPs [9,12,16­ 18], and clear experimental evidence of the role of OBPs in olfaction and odorant perception has not yet been produced. Peculiar in the case of bovine OBP (bOBP) is the anti-cooperative binding resulting in the stoichiometry of a single molecule of IBMP per dimer of OBP, repeatedly reported in the literature [1,8,9]. ° We have reported the first 3D structure of bOBP at 2.0 A [19]. In fact, the prototype of OBPs was demonstrated to be a ÔspecialÕ case among lipocalins, as it is a dimer with a swapped helix, possibly providing interdependent properties to the two subunits [19]. As previously found in the case of 6 retinol-binding protein [20] and Major Urinary Protein [21], a natural ligand that co-purified with the protein was observed in the b-barrel cavity of bOBP [19,22]. The further unambiguous identification of this natural ligand as 1-octen-3-ol (OCT), an insect attractant produced by bovine rumination, suggested a role of bOBP in the ecological relationships between bovine and several insect species [23]. Porcine OBP (pOBP) [24] was revealed to be a monomer and to have a cavity devoid of any ligand, which made it a good candidate for studying the interaction with a broad range of ligands of bOBP [9,12,16,18] or pOBP [16,18]. The structure of different complexes of pOBP showed the presence of the odorants, in a stoichiometric molar ratio,

inside the cavity formed by the b-barrel. The orientation of the ligands inside the cavity appeared to be opportunistic with no specific target patches for aromatic or charged groups and no correlation between the number of contacts and the affinity measured in solution. In particular, no special characteristic could be ascribed to the good binders, and upon interaction with all odorants, all residue sidechains lining the cavity kept the conformation observed in the native protein. While these results were not in favor of a specific carrier role for OBPs [13], other studies performed in solution, although sometimes contradictory, pointed to a contrasting 7 situation. Fluorescence studies in solution with three rat OBPs and 49 different ligands revealed some preference of each OBP to certain classes of chemical compounds, suggesting a specific filter role of OBPs [17]. Recently, biophysical studies on a subclass of dimeric rat OBP (OBP1F) indicated that one ligand binds per monomer and that subtle changes in the side-chains or backbone positions were induced upon binding [25]. Another group could express a human OR in mammalian cells and demonstrate highaffinity binding with empty porcine OBP, although binding was further localized in several tissues besides nasal mucosa. Another class of lipocalins ­ tear lipocalin-1 ­ was shown to bind with high affinity to a new class of receptor not belonging to the GPCR family as ORs, and to be further internalized [26]. With a view to collecting hard data based on crystal structures, possibly displaying conformational changes, we chose bOBP as a good candidate for ligand studies ­ the native structure of bOBP showed some flexibility at Phe89, and its dimer structure seemed favorable for investigating putative cross-talk between both subunits. We report, in this study, the X-ray structures of complexes with five ligands determined at a resolution ° of 1.7­2.05 A. These X-ray studies were completed with titration of bOBP by the same odorant molecules, in competition with 1-amino-anthracene (AMA). The odorant molecules were observed inside the two cavities formed by the b-barrels, together with some residual natural ligand (OCT) in three of the complexes. The interactions established with the protein were found to be essentially hydrophobic, although few hydrogen bonds were observed with ligands bearing polar groups. The internal cavity exhibits flexibility because Phe89 displays two discrete alternate positions, as in the native protein. These results confirm previous studies on pOBP and define the role of bOBP as able to recognize efficiently molecules pertaining to different chemical classes. The absence of significant conformational change at the protein surface is not in favor of an OR triggering role for bOBP, thus leaving this question still open for new experiments.

phenone (BZP), dihydromyrcenol or 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen2-ol (DHM) and undecanal (UND) were purchased from Fluka, and IBMP and OCT were from Aldrich. Stock solutions (2 mM) of the odorants were prepared in ethanol, then further diluted in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5% (v/v) ethanol (TE buffer). In the binding studies, the odorant solutions in TE buffer were prepared just before each experiment and used only once. Fluorescence-binding assay The fluorescence-binding assay of AMA with bOBP, and the competition between AMA and odorants, were carried out according to a method published previously [27], with minor modifications [23]. The influence of the concentration of ethanol on the chasing process of AMA was tested and found to be negligible up to 1% (v/v), a result in contrast with the behavior of rat OBP reported by Briand et al. [28]. In brief, the formation of AMA­OBP complexes was determined by following an increase of the fluorescence emission at 480 nm, upon excitation at 380 nm, using a PerkinElmer LS 50 luminescence spectrometer. The dissociation constants of the AMA­OBP complexes were determined from the titration curves using the nonlinear fitting facility, SIGMA PLOT 5.0 (Cambridge Soft Corp., Cambridge, MA, USA). Saturation levels were determined from calibration curves obtained by incubating increasing concentrations of AMA (0.076­5 lM) with a fixed, saturating concentration of OBP (1 lM). In the competition curves, the OBP samples (0.5 lM and 1 lM, respectively, for bOBP and pOBP) were incubated with a fixed amount of AMA (3 lM) and increasing concentrations of odorants (0.39­50 lM). The chasing of AMA bound to OBP was followed as a decay of the emission of the fluorescence intensity at 480 nm, and the curves, for each odorant, were analyzed using the SIGMA PLOT 5.0 software for the determination of the apparent dissociation constants (Kdiss app.). Kdiss true values were calculated from apparent Kdiss, using the following formula: Kdiss true ¼ kdiss app: Â 1=½1 þ ð1=Kdiss AMA Â ½AMAÞ which takes into account the Kdiss for AMA and the concentration of AMA. Crystallization, data collection and refinement of bovine OBP Except for the bOBP­UND complex, bOBP crystals were obtained by microdialysis of a 10 mgÆmL)1 protein solution against 28­32% (v/v) ethanol, in 50 mM citrate, pH 5.4, at 4 °C. Crystals of the bOBP­UND complex were obtained by vapour diffusion in the presence of 18­40% (v/v) ethanol, 20 mM citrate, pH 4.2, 0.05% (v/v) 8 poly(vinylpyrrolidone). All crystals belong to space ° ° group P21, with cell dimensions a ¼ 55.9 A, b ¼ 65.5 A, ° c ¼ 42.7 A and b ¼ 98.8°, and contain one homodimer in the asymmetric unit. The bOBP­odorant complexes were obtained by soaking the crystals, overnight at 4 °C, in synthetic crystallization solutions containing 2 mM odorant. For the chasing of AMA by IBMP, the same procedure as in the solution fluorescence study was followed: a crystal of bOBP was first

Overall structures of the complexes As described previously, bOBP is a 2 · 159 residue dimer at neutral or basic pH, and a monomer at pH values below 4.5 ° [36]. The 2.0 A resolution structure of bOBP has been reported previously [19,22] and its natural ligand has been identified [23]. Briefly, each monomer is composed of a lipocalin-type nine-stranded b-barrel comprising residues 15­121 (strands 1­8) and residues 145­149 (strand 9) from the other monomer (Fig. 2). From residue 123 onwards, the topology diverges from the consensus lipocalin fold: the b-barrel is connected by an extended stretch of residues (123­126) to the a-helix protruding out of the b-barrel and

crossing the dimer interface (Fig. 2). As a consequence, the a-helix of one monomer is placed close to where the a-helix of the other monomer would be if bOBP had a classical lipocalin fold, in a peculiar arrangement named domain swapping (Fig. 2). In the present structures, the two bOBP polypeptidic chains are visible from residues 1­159 and 3­157 for molecules A and B, respectively. The electron density map of molecule A is generally better defined than that of molecule B, although its B factors are generally slightly higher (Table 1). When superimposing pairwise the Ca traces of the bOBP dimer for all complexes, the rmsd values ° ° range between 0.06 A to 0.30 A, values within positional ° errors at this resolution (1.64­1.3 A, in the present study ° and 1.8 A for the natural complex OCT­bOBP) [23]. Superposition of monomers A and B for each complex confirms also that the lack of symmetry, owing to a different helix position relative to the b-barrel, is conserved. Complexes with the odorant compounds The internal cavities. An electron density accounting for the presence of a bound ligand is found in each cavity of monomers A and B of bOBP (Fig. 3). As for the polypeptide chain, the electron density map of the ligand is generally better defined in monomer A than in monomer B. The interpretation of the map is more difficult than in pOBP [37], however, because residual binding of the natural ligand (OCT) occurred with some complexes and had to be estimated along the refinement (Table 3). This is the case for

the complexes with AMA, AMA/IBMP and DHM. The complexes with BZP and UND do not include residual OCT (Table 3). The positions of the complete sets of ligands clusters, when superimposed, result in a global volume of ° % 12 · 7 · 3 A3 (Fig. 4A). They establish contacts with 17 residues forming the cavity walls, among which 11 are hydrophobic and six are polar noncharged (Table 4, Fig. 4B). No contacts are established with charged residues as none point inside the cavity. Some residues are preeminently involved in interactions with the ligands (thresh° old 10 A2), such as Phe36, Phe40, Phe54, Phe89, Phe119, 14 and, above all, Asn103 (Table 4). The surface covered by the various ligands is rather homogeneous, with an average ° value of 156 ± 20 A2 (Table 4). While electron density maps of the side-chains are well defined and unique, Phe89 presents two main positions, as reported previously [19,22,35], i.e. in a closed position (Fig. 5A) or an open (Fig. 5B) position. Phe89 may also be present in a mixture of alternate open and closed positions, leading to different 15 cavity volumes. As seen in Table 5 and in Fig. 5, the volume of the larger cavity is smaller when Phe89 is closed (Fig. 5A), rather than open (Fig. 5A), as the internal volume is split into alternate large and small cavities. Indeed, the cavity volumes with Phe89 in both open and closed positions are comparable to those with Phe89 in the 16 closed conformation.

OCT, the natural ligand. Although the structure of the complex of bOBP with OCT has been reported previously [23], we will briefly recall its binding mode here. The nature of OCT of bOBP was determined by GC/MS. The two enantiomers of OCT (ratio 1 : 1) were fitted with the most appropriate conformations in the electron density maps within each barrel, and their occupancies were refined in the CNS. The two isomers have very similar orientations, and are quasi superimposed (Fig. 3M,N). The aliphatic chains of the two isomers are extended and remain close to each other. The hydroxyl groups point to the same direction, although to an area of the cavity walls where no hydrogen bond donor is available. AMA. The structure of the complex between bOBP and AMA has already been described [23] and we recall here these results and a more detailed analysis. AMA in complex with bOBP occupies the same place as the natural ligand, i.e. in the internal cavity of the b-barrel of each monomer [19,35]. In cavity A, the initial electron density map for AMA was very clear and a molecule of AMA was fitted readily (Fig. 3A). The AMA molecule accounted for the total electron density, and its occupation was maintained at 100% (Table 3). All residues in the combining site are well defined in the electron density map and do not exhibit alternate conformations. The side-chain of Phe89 presents

for Phe89 in cavity A; while the other conformation, with a slimmer density, is the closed one, similar to that found in the native structure with its natural ligand (Table 5). The position of AMA in cavity B is very similar to that observed in cavity A. BZP. The map of the complex with BZP exhibits a clear electron density for the ligand in site A associated with low B-factors (Table 1, Fig. 3G). The ligand exhibits a unique conformation, and no trace of the natural ligand is detected in the electron density map (Table 3). The two phenyl rings of BZP form a dihedral angle of % 40° (Fig. 3). The carbonyl group of BZP establishes a canonic hydrogen ° bond (d ¼ 2.8 A, angle ¼ 126°) with the hydroxyl group of Thr38. The other contacts are exclusively hydrophobic (Table 4). In cavity B, the position of BZP is also well defined and unique (Fig. 3H, Table 3). The hydrogen bond ° with Thr38 is longer than in subunit A (3.4 A) and its geometry less optimum. Phe89 is observed in both the open and the closed positions in subunit A, and only in the closed position in subunit B (Table 5). DHM. The map of the DHM­bOBP complex exhibits intricate features. First, Phe89 displays alternate conformations in both monomers, as in the case of OCT (Table 5). This is not surprising as both OCT and DHM exhibit a

only the open conformation among the two observed in the native protein (Table 5). In contrast, in cavity B the electron density map around AMA and Phe89 displays complex features. Some residual density appears at several places when only the AMA molecule is taken into account for the calculation of the electron density map. These bulbs of positive difference density disappear when 20% of the natural ligand and 80% of AMA are introduced in the calculations (Fig. 3B, Table 3). Phe89 has two conformations: the predominant one is the open conformation, found

similar elongated shape. Furthermore, the electron density map could not be accounted for using only DHM, but the introduction of 70% DHM and 30% remaining OCT

almost suppresses residual electron density map (Fig. 3I,J). The hydroxyl group of DHM exhibits a hydrogen bond ° with the Asn103 Nd2 atom (3.0 A).

Fig. 5. Representation of the molecular surfaces of the cavities in monomer A. Left, bovine odorant-binding protein-1/amino-anthracene (bOBP­AMA) complex. The Phe89 side-chain presents only the open position (yellow) and the cavity is unique (pink). Right, bovine odorant-binding protein/benzyl-benzoate (bOBP­BZP) complex, with the Phe89 side-chain in alternate positions: the open position is yellow, the closed position is orange. Note that the closed position of Phe89 separates the cavity (as seen in the left view) into two (light and dark blue). The figure was produced using GRASP [49]. See also Table 5.

UND. The UND molecule is better defined in subunit A where all atoms are present in the electron density map (Fig. 3K). In subunit B, the last atoms of the alkyl chain (C9-C11) are poorly defined (Fig. 3L). In both subunits, the occupancy of UND is 100% (Table 3). UND adopts an extended conformation up to carbon 5 and then bends to form a U-shaped structure (Fig. 3K,L). The aldehyde function does not establish any hydrogen bond with the residues of the cavity. The complex with UND is the only one where Phe89 does not assume alternate positions in either subunits: Phe89 is in the open position in subunit A and in the closed position in subunit B (Table 5). In relation to the position of Phe89, the position of the U-shaped part of UND adopts opposite directions in subunits A and B (Fig. 3K,L). Furthermore, the position adopted by UND in subunit A would not be compatible with the closed position of Phe89 in subunit B. Communication of the internal cavity with the bulk solvent The cavity of bOBP has no direct access to the solvent, which is also the case for other lipocalins, such as pOBP [24] or aphrodisin [3]. A unique side-chain shields the cavity from the solvent, however. Combined with the open position of Phe89, the rotation of Tyr83 by 120° (Fig. 6Aa) opens a communication path to the internal cavity through which ligands might find access (Fig. 6B). This rotation is not hindered by neighboring residues, and should therefore require a small amount of energy. This suggests strongly that Tyr83 may be the ÔdoorÕ of the cavity, and might trigger the access of the natural substrate (Fig. 6). Furthermore, no crystal packing contacts involve this part of the bOBP surface, which faces water crystal channels. This is indeed the reason why soaking odorant molecules in the crystals was successful. It is worthy of mention that in pOBP, Tyr83 is well situated to perform a similar role, and that the corresponding residue (Tyr76) in aphrodisin has already been proposed as being the cavity door [23].

IBMP. A complex with IBMP has been submitted to X-ray analysis, aiming to understand the peculiar behavior of IBMP in solution (Introduction and Experimental procedures). With this aim, the procedure used to obtain the complex reproduced exactly the fluorescence experiment, i.e. IBMP chasing AMA bound to bOBP (see the Experimental procedures). In the structure, the electron density map at both sites differed from that of AMA in the bOBP­AMA complex, and the size of the density indicates that some AMA is still bound (Fig. 3E,F). IBMP has been modeled in the electron density map of cavity A and B, and AMA has been introduced. After refinement with CNS, including occupancy refinement for IBMP and AMA, the electon density map could be modeled with 40% AMA and 60% IBMP, in cavity A (Fig. 3E, Table 3). In cavity B, some of the natural ligand had also to be introduced, leading to occupation values of 42% AMA, 42% IBMP and 16% OCT (Fig. 3F, Table 3). Although the occupancy values may differ in different experiments and should be interpreted with caution, these results confirm that in the crystal, as in solution, only one IBMP molecule binds per bOBP dimer. In subunit A, Phe89 is found in the open conformation, while the closed one is found in subunit B (Table 5).

Discussion
The average of the Kdiss values for bOBP is comparable (1.2 lM) to that found for pOBP (1.6 lM) (Table 2). The bOBP natural ligand, OCT, presents a slightly better affinity for bOBP than for pOBP. Amazingly, IBMP, taken historically as the reference compound for binding studies with OBPs [1,2], is the poorest ligand of bOBP and an excellent ligand of pOBP; the affinity for bOBP is 10 times smaller than for pOBP. There is no evident correlation between the bulkiness, the flexibility or the chemical functions borne by the different compounds and their affinity with either OBP. It should be noted that the ratio of the Kdiss values for bOBP are grouped within a factor of 10, meaning that the differences in energy involved are rather low. This range of values is similar to that observed for rat OBP-F1 (Nespoulos) and for rat OBPs 1­3, for each of the proteins analyzed individually [17]. As mentioned above, the bOBP cavity is mostly hydrophobic. Besides BZP, the ligands make little use of the five semipolar residues in the cavity to establish hydrogen

bonds. Consequently, 80% of the contact surface involves hydrophobic residues (Table 4). Bulky molecules, like AMA and BZP, exhibit very close positions in both subunits. However, even in these two clear-cut cases, the side-chain of Phe89 exhibits different orientations in subunits A and B. Slight differences have also been observed in the position of the OCT molecules [35] and are observed here for the molecules of DHM. Only the UND molecule exhibits a totally opposite position in subunits A and B, clearly associated with the orientation of Phe89. The position of Phe89 can be somewhat rationalized in terms of subunit. In subunit A, the open position is favored, with three complexes exhibiting it, while three others present a mixture of closed and open positions; no closed-only 17; position is observed. In subunit B, two closed, four alternate and no open-only positions are observed (Table 5). All the conformational changes observed, however, are internal to bOBP, and do not affect the protein surface. It cannot be excluded, however, that the different conformations of Phe89 in each subunit result in a cross-talk of the monomers, triggered by subtle differences in backbone/ side-chain dynamics and controlling the access of a second molecule after the binding of the first one. This mechanism might be more general in dimeric OBPs, as rat OBP-F1 has been shown to display an anti-cooperative mechanism [25]. Our results do not report a specificity of interaction between bOBP and the limited number of odorant molecules studied here. However, considering the drastic differences between the molecules chosen, a fine discriminating role of bOBP seems to be excluded. The situation concerning a putative role of OBPs in OR triggering, upon odorant binding, is far from clear. The high-affinity binding of empty pOBP to a human OR in mammalian cells does not favor the role of OBP as ligand carrier [38]. Furthermore, the activity of the ORs in response to odorant molecules alone has been reported [39]. If a model such as bacterial chemotaxis was applicable to mammalian OBPs, it would be expected that they would undergo a significant conformational change upon complexation. Such a behavior has been demonstrated for

serum retinol-binding protein, which, upon a conformational change of a loop, can interact with a second protein, transthyretin, and prevent retinol excretion [40,41]. With bOBP, the only conformational change observed in the crystal structure is internal to the molecule. Similarly, no conformational changes have been detected by the structural comparison between unliganded and liganded pOBP, nor were detected by IR spectroscopy [27]. However, solution binding or spectroscopic studies on rat OBPs [17,25] have demonstrated a certain specificity of rOBPs for wide substrate classes as well as some conformational change upon receptor binding. In insects, antennal OBPs, pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) and Chemosensory Proteins (CSPs) are able to perform considerable conformational changes [42] and could be candidates for receptor triggering, as suggested recently from electro-sensillar recording [43]. Fully sequenced insect genomes have shown the presence of multiple copies of putative OBP/PBP ORFs: 38 members in Drosophila melanogaster [44] and 29 members in Anopheles gambiae [45]. Amazingly, the number of ORs expressed in Drosophila is % 40 (on 62 candidates) [46,47], not disallowing the possible existence of functional OBP­OR couples. In mammals, the number of ORs is in the order of several hundred, while the number of OBPs is at best a handful, not sufficient, by far, to suggest a specific functional interaction between a given OR with an OBP.
