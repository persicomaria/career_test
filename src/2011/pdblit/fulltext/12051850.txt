The crystal structure of Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 a-Amylase II (TVAII) has been determined by multiple isomorphous replacement at Ê 2.6 A resolution. TVAII was crystallized in an orthorhombic system with Ê Ê the space group P212121 and the cell dimensions a  118.5 A, b  119.5 A, Ê c  114.5 A. There are two molecules in an asymmetric unit, related by the non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. Diffraction data were collected Ê Ê at 113 K and the cell dimensions reduced to a  114.6 A, b  117.9 A, Ê Ê c  114.2 A, and the model was re®ned against 7.0-2.6 A resolution data giving an R-factor of 0.204 (Rfree  0.272). The ®nal model consists of 1170 amino acid residues (two molecules) and 478 water molecules with good chemical geometry. TVAII has three domains, A, B, and C, like other a-amylases. Domain A with a (b/a)8 barrel structure and domain C with a b-sandwich structure are very similar to those found in other aamylases. Additionally, TVAII has an extra domain N composed of 121 amino acid residues at the N-terminal site, which has a b-barrel-like structure consisting of seven antiparallel b-strands. Domain N is one of the driving forces in the formation of the dimer structure of TVAII, but its role in the enzyme activity is still not clear. TVAII does not have the Ca2 binding site that connects domains A and B in other a-amylases, rather the NZ atom of Lys299 of TVAII serves as the connector between these domains. TVAII can hydrolyze cyclodextrins and pullulan as well as starch. Based on a structural comparison with the complex between a mutant cyclodextrin glucanotransferase and a b-cyclodextrin derivative, Phe286 located at domain B is considered the residue most likely to recognize the hydrophobic cavity of cyclodextrins. The active-site cleft of TVAII is wider and shallower than that of other a-amylases, and seems to be suitable for the binding of pullulan which is expected not to adopt the helical structure of amylose.

a-Amylases (1,4-a-D-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.1) hydrolyze internal 1,4-a-D-glucosidic linkages of starch and glycogen to release a-anomer products. They are widely distributed in nature, and are very important enzymes in starch and glycogen-metabolism of microorganisms, plants and animals. Several a-amylases have been successfully used not only in the fermentation and food processing industries, but also in pharmaceutical ®elds as digestives (Komaki, 1998; Yamamoto & Shinke, 1995).

908 Crystal structures of a-amylases from Bacillus licheniformis (Machius et al., 1995), Bacillus subtilis (Fujimoto et al., 1998), Aspergillus oryzae (Matsuura et al., 1984; Swift et al., 1991), Aspergillus niger (Boel et al., 1990), barley (Kadziola et al., 1994), yellow meal worm (Strobl et al., 1998), pig pancreas (Qian et al., 1993; Larson et al., 1994), human pancreas (Brayer et al., 1995) and human salivary gland (Ramasubbu et al., 1996) have been reported. Tertiary structures of related enzymes, cyclodextrin glucanotransferases (CGTases) from Bacillus stearothemophilus (Kubota et al., 1991), Bacillus circulans strain 8 (Klein et al., 1991), B. circulans strain 251 (Lawson et al., 1994), and Thermoanerobacterium thermosulfurigenes EM1 (Knegtel et al., 1996), maltotetraose-forming a-amylase from Pseudomonas stutzeri (Morishita et al., 1997), oligo-1,6-glucosidase from Bacillus cereus (Watanabe et al., 1997) and isoamylase from Pseudomonas amyloderamosa (Katsuya et al., 1998), have also been determined. These results show that a-amylases and related enzymes have common structural features. They have three typical domains, domains A and C, and a protruded loop from domain A which is usually called domain B. Domain A has a (b/a)8 barrel and domain C has a b-sandwich structure folded by two b-sheets except the barley a-amylase and maltotetraohydrolase whose domain C has a b-sheet. The structures of domains A and C are well conserved, while the domain B structure has been found to vary. Also, a-amylases and the related enzymes listed above usually have a conserved Ca2 binding site located at the interface between domains A and B, and the Ca2 is coordinated to form a plane structure. Four amino acid residues of the enzyme serve as ligands for the Ca2 and two of them, Asn and Asp, are also strictly conserved. Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 produces two aamylases, TVAI (637 amino acid residues (mature form), MW  71,000 Da; Tonozuka et al., 1995; Ibuka et al., 1998) and TVAII (585 amino acid residues, MW  67,500 Da; Tonozuka et al., 1994). In addition to hydrolyzing 1,4-a-D-glucosidic linkages of starch mainly to produce maltose, TVAI and TVAII can also ef®ciently hydrolyze 1,4-a-D-glucosidic linkages of cyclic oligosaccharides (cyclodextrins (CDs)) with six (a-CD), seven (b-CD), eight (g-CD) glucose units, and pullulan with the sequence repeat of 1,4-a, 1,4-a and 1,6-a-glycosidic linkages to produce maltose and panose, respectively (Tonozuka et al., 1993), while most of the other a-amylases scarcely hydrolyze CDs and pullulan. The Michaelis constants Km for b-CD of TVAI, TVAII (Tonozuka et al., 1995), a-amylase from A. oryzae (TAA; Suetsugu et al., 1974) and CGTase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. 1011 (Nakamura et al., 1993) are 4.40Â 10À2, 1.17Â 10À3, 1.02Â 104 and 1.7Â 10À4 M, respectively, suggesting that the af®nity for b-CD of TVAI and TVAII is suf®ciently stronger than that of TAA and comparable with that of CGTase. The relative activities for pullulan and amylose (based on kcat/Km) of TVAI and

Structure of -Amylase Hydrolyzing Cyclodextrins

TVAII are about 210 % and 9 %, respectively (Tonozuka et al., 1995). Alignment of amino acid sequences based on the highly conserved regions (I, II, III and IV) of the a-amylase family (Nakajima et al, 1986) revealed that the N terminus of TVAI and TVAII was over 120 amino acid residues longer than that of TAA (Tonozuka et al., 1993). Also, CGTases have more than 200 additional amino acid residues in the C-terminal site forming domains D and E, and pullulanase (Katsuragi et al., 1987; Kornacker et al., 1989) and neopullulanase (Takata et al., 1992; Igarashi et al., 1992; Smith & Salyers, 1991) which can hydrolyze pullulan, have additional amino acid residues at the N-terminal site. The extra N-terminal residues of TVAI and TVAII would form domain structures and have a role in the enzyme activity. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of TVAI and of TVAII, and a structural comparison with other a-amylases and CGTases should be useful in elucidating the enzyme characteristics of TVAI and TVAII. Here, we report the Ê 2.6 A resolution crystal structure of TVAII at 113 K and the structural comparison of TVAII and a mutant CGTase from B. circulans strain 8 (CGT8) making a complex with a b-CD derivative (Schmidt et al., 1998).

Results and Discussion
Quality of the structure There are two molecules in an asymmetric unit, Mol-1 and Mol-2, and they are related by non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (NCS). Structure re®nement statistics are listed in Table 1. The r.m.s. of bond distances and angles of the structure are Ê Ê 0.012 A and 2.8  for Mol-1 and 0.011 A and 2.7  for Mol-2, respectively, suggesting quite good chemical geometry. As shown in Figure 1, a Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968) shows that 86.8 % of the residues in Mol-1 and 86.6 % of the residues in Mol-2 are in the most favored regions as determined by the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1992), and no residue is in the disallowed regions or the generously allowed regions. A Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) gives an estimate of the error in the atomic posÊ itions to be around 0.28 A. The ®nal (2Fo À Fc) electron density map contoured at 1s shows continuous density for all main-chain atoms except residues 545-548 in both Mol-1 and Mol-2, and for all side-chain atoms except residue 524 in both Mol-1 and Mol-2. TVAII has two residues with a cis-peptide bond, Pro274 and Pro466 in both Mol-1 and Mol-2, and the segments around Pro466 in Mol-1 with the electron density map contoured at 1s is shown in Figure 2. Average B-factors of Ê Ê Mol-1 and Mol-2 are 27.1 A2 and 30.1 A2, respectively.

909 Figure 3(a). TVAII has 12 a-helices and 25 bstrands, and 23 % of residues are involved in ahelices and 25 % of residues in b-strands. A topological diagram showing the arrangement and naming of the secondary structure element is presented in Figure 4. The structure of TVAII can be divided into four domains; the N-terminal domain from residues 1121 forming a b-structure (domain N), the central domain from 122-242 and 298-502 forming a (b/a)8 barrel structure (domain A), the small loop domain from 243-297 (domain B), and the C-terminal domain from 503-585 forming a b-structure (domain C). All of the available structures of aamylases have three of these regions, domains A, B and C, however domain N has not been found in a-amylases except isoamylase (Katsuya et al., 1998). CGT8 has two extra domains (domains D and E) in addition to domains A, B and C, but they are located at the C-terminal site, having a b-structure with nine b-strands (domain D) and eight bstrands (domain E; Klein et al., 1991). Superpositioned Ca models of TVAII and CGT8 are shown in Figure 3(b). TVAII and CGT8 are indicated by thick and thin lines, respectively, and the highly conserved regions (I, II, III and IV) are indicated by continuous lines. The b-strands and a-helices of domain A and the b-strands of domain C are well superimposed, while differences are found in domain B and the loop regions between b-strands and a-helices in domain A. Interestingly, the additional domains, domain N of TVAII and domains D and E of CGT8, are located on the

Overall structure The r.m.s. deviations between Mol-1 and Mol-2 Ê Ê are 1.06 A for all atoms and 0.48 A for main-chain atoms, suggesting that the two structures are almost identical. Since a signi®cant difference in polypeptide backbones is found in residues 545548 where the electron density is very poor indicating disordered regions, the structure of TVAII is represented by that of Mol-1 (if not stated otherwise). The molecular dimensions of TVAII are Ê Ê Ê approximately 85 A Â 78 A Â 42 A. The overall folding of polypeptide backbone is shown in

same side of domain A (the left-hand side in Figure 3(b)), however, they occupy completely different positions spatially. In CGT8, domains D and E make many interactions with domains A and B, and also domain E is close to the active site. On the other hand, in TVAII, domain N has little interaction with other domains and is far from the active site. Recently, domain N has been reported in the structure of isoamylase (Katsuya et al., 1998). It is composed of six b-strands forming a b-sandwich structure and an a-helix, and located adjacent to the second and third a-helices of domain A (the up side of domain A in Figure 3(b)) making contact with domain A, different from that of TVAII and CGT8. Domain structures and interactions between domains Domain N has a b-structure of seven antiparallel b-strands with a Greek key motif from b3N to b6N, as shown in Figure 5(a). Since the ®rst and the second b-strands are divided into two strands by the bulges of residues 9-14 and 98-110, respectively, there are in total actually nine b-strands. Although b1N and b7N are arranged in a parallel fashion without hydrogen bonds between the main-chain atoms, domain N forms a distorted bbarrel-like structure where the barrel is not closed. Numerous hydrophobic residues are located in the interior of the barrel to form strong hydrophobic interactions constructing the core of domain N, and many polar and charged residues are located on the exterior of the barrel to form the solventaccessible surface. However, hydrophobic residues, Leu3, Ile6, Ala10, Val94, Phe96, Phe101, Phe111 and Tyr113 interact between b1N and b7N, forming the hydrophobic groove on the molecular surface which hinders solvent access. Although this hydrophobic groove seems to be partially covered by the polar and charged residues in the bulges of b1N and b7N, it is closely related to the formation of the dimer structure of TVAII in the crystal, as

described below. Domain N is located far from the active site, and connected to domain A by the long loop of residues 114-131. Domain N is almost isolated from other domains, and interacts mainly with the residues around an a-helix (a6bA) of domain A, as listed in Table 2. The only hydrogen bond with domain C is found between the mainchain carbonyl oxygen atom (O) of Ala60 and the side-chain atom (NH2) of Arg506. Domain A has a round-shaped (b/a)8 barrel structure constructing the core of the enzyme, and the loops between b-strands and a-helices comprise the active site along with domain B. In the typical (b/a)8 barrel structure (the TIM barrel; Banner et al., 1975), a-helices regularly run antiparallel to the bstrands, however, this regularity is broken by the a-helices at the sixth position. The a6aA is the extension of the previous b-strand (b6A) and runs parallel with it, and this a6aA is connected to the next a-helix (a6bA) by a short loop. These ahelices, a6aA and a6bA, are arranged in an antiparallel fashion and there are a large number of interactions between them. Antiparallel a-helices at the sixth position of domain A are also found in TAA and CGTases, while the other a-amylases have a short 310-helix as the second helix at the sixth position or no helix at that position. In TVAII, the a6bA interacts with both domains N and C, as listed in Table 2, playing an important role in ®xing the relative location and orientation of domains N, A and C. Domain B participating in the substrate binding is inserted between b3A and a3A of domain A, and consists of an a-helix and several extended segments. The extended segments form hydrogen bonds between main-chain atoms like an antiparallel b-sheet, giving a stable globular structure, as shown in Figure 5(b). Although the structure of domain B is not usually conserved among a-amylases and CGTases, the structure of the Ca2 binding site located on the interface of domains A and B is highly conserved. The highly conserved residues of Asn and Asp participating in the Ca2

binding are located in the extended segments at the N-terminal and C-terminal sites of domain B, respectively. Corresponding residues of TVAII are Asn243 and Lys295 (not Asp), and the locations of these residues are very similar to those of TAA and CGT8, in spite of the substitution of Lys for Asp. Domain C has a b-sandwich structure with eight antiparallel b-strands having a Greek key motif from b5C to b8C. The upper b-sheet which makes many interactions with domain A, consists of b1C, b2C, b3C and b8C, and the lower b-sheet consists of other b-strands. There are many hydrophobic residues between the b-sheets, forming strong hydrophobic interactions. Although domain C is located far from the active site like domain N, it has more interactions with domain A than domain N, as listed in Table 2. The interactions are found between the upper b-sheet of domain C and the residues around the sixth and seventh a-helices of domain A, and the interface structure between domain A and C is similar to those of TAA and CGT8. Thus, domain C is thought to help to stabilize the structure of domain A, especially to ®x the orientation and location of the sixth and seventh ahelices, which are very close to the active site residues in the IVth highly conserved region (residue 416-421). TVAII has no Ca2 binding site So far the reported structures of a-amylases and CGTases have Ca2 binding sites, one of which is strictly conserved. The conserved Ca2 binding site is located on the interface between domains A and B, and a Ca2 is coordinated by four residues forming a plane structure. They are Asn139, Asp199, Ile190 and His233 in CGT8, and Asn121, Asp175, Glu162 and His210 in TAA, and two of these residues, Asn and Asp, are highly conserved. However, there is no signi®cant peak in the electron

density for a Ca2 in the structure of TVAII, indicating that a Ca2 does not occupy the speci®c position. The conserved Ca2 binding site of CGT8 and the corresponding site of TVAII are superimposed in Figure 6. In CGT8, a Ca2 is coordinated by OD1 atom of Asn139, OD1 and OD2 atoms of Asp199, a main chain O atom of Ile190, and a main-chain O atom of His233. In TVAII, corresponding residues are Asn243, Lys295 and Glu329, and there is no residue corresponding to Ile190 which is located in domain B. In TVAII, the segment around Ile190 is completely missing, as shown in Figure 5(b). The absence of this segment in domain B is also related to the shape of the active site of TVAII, as described below. The NZ atom of Lys295 occupies the Ca2 position to form hydrogen bonds with the OD1 atom of Asn243 and the main-chain O atom of Glu329. The NZ atom of Lys295 takes on the role of Ca2 to connect these residues and to ®x the relative orientation and location of domains A and B. From this structure, it is expected that the activity of TVAII is independent of the Ca2, which is different to that of CGT8 and of TAA. Structure of the active site Structural studies of the complexes of a-amylases with products and inhibitors elucidated that three acidic residues in the highly conserved regions (II, III and IV) are essential for hydrolyzing of substrates (Brzozowski et al., 1997; Machius et al., 1996; Qian et al., 1994; Kadziola et al., 1998). These residues are Asp325, Glu354 and Asp421 in TVAII. Recently, the structure of the complex of mutant CGT8 with a derivative of b-CD has revealed the interactions between active site residues and b-CD as a substrate (Schmidt et al., 1998). These results have enable us to build a b-CD binding model of TVAII and other a-amylases, to elucidate how TVAII can hydrolyze CDs and why other a-amy-

The strictly conserved residues among TVAII, CGT8 and TAA in the active site, almost all of which are located in the highly conserved regions (I, II, III and IV), were ®tted to minimize the r.m.s. deviations of the They are distances between Ca atoms.

The active site structures of TVAII and CGT8 are shown in Figure 7(a) and (b), respectively. The b-CD moiety in the structure of CGT8 is also transferred into the active sites of TVAII. The coordinates of CGT8 (3CGT) and TAA (6TAA) were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). It is proposed that the Glu354-257-230 residue, substituted for Ala in the mutant CGT8, forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule which is likely involved in hydrolysis. In TVAII, Glu354 is close to the superimposed b-CD, directing the sidechain to it. Other conserved charged residues, His244-140-122 His420-327-296, Asp421-328-297, Asp465-371-340 and Arg469-375-344 have similar orientations and locations among TVAII, CGT8 and TAA. Tyr195 of CGT8 enters into the hydrophobic cavity of b-CD and plays an important role in the recognition of b-CD as a substrate. In TVAII, Phe286 is the residue most likely to recognize the hydro-

phobic cavity of b-CD. Phe286 of TVAII forms stacking interactions with His244 and hydrophobic interactions with Val326, and does not enter the cavity of b-CD as deeply as Tyr195 of CGT8. However, Phe286 is located on the center axis of b-CD, and could be expected to recognize the hydrophobic rim composed of the position 6 methylene groups (C6 atoms) of a glucose unit. On the other hand, in TAA, there is no residue to recognize the hydrophobic cavity of b-CD. Although His122 of TAA (His244 in TVAII and His140 in CGT8), located just under the b-CD, seems to enter the cavity of the b-CD, His140 of CGT8 interacts with b-CD and other amino acid residues via hydrogen bonds. Also, this His residue of barley a-amylase was shown to have a hydrogen bond with the glucosyl residue as substrate by mutagenesis study (Sùgaard et al., 1993). Therefore there is little possibility that His122 of TAA recognizes the hydrophobic cavity of b-CD. The role of the six residues with planar sidechains, His98, Tyr100, Trp101, Phe259, Tyr89 and Phe183, in CGT8 could be to ®x a substrate in the proper orientation and position for the catalytic residues. TVAII has only four of these residues, His202, Tyr204, Asp205 (not shown in Figure 7(a)) and Trp356, which seem to play the same role as in CGT8. Although the orientation of Trp356 is unfavorable for interaction with a glucose ring of a substrate, the substrate binding to the enzyme might induce the conformational change of Trp356.

In TVAII, there are no residues corresponding to Tyr89 and Phe183 of CGT8, which are located in the loop between the b-strand and a-helix at the second position of domain A (Tyr89), and domain B (Phe183) in CGT8, respectively. In TVAII, the corresponding loop at the second position of domain A has a different structure, and the corresponding region around Phe183 in domain B is completely lacking, as mentioned above. Although Tyr45* is located close to Phe183, it is not a residue of Mol-1 but of Mol-2, as described below. On the other hand, TAA has all of the six corresponding residues, His80, Tyr82, Trp83, Leu232, Tyr75 and Tyr155, in contact with the superimposed b-CD, as well as CGT8. Because in TAA, many unusual short contacts between these residues and the superimposed b-CD are found, the active site cleft of TAA seems to be small for b-CD. Therefore, TVAII has a relatively wide and shallow cleft for substrates compared to CGT8 and TAA, caused by the different structure of the loop at the second position of domain A and the segment lacking in domain B. This wide and shallow cleft of TVAII may be favorable for the binding of pullulan as a substrate. Since pullulan has a sequence repeat of two 1,4-a and one 1,6-a-glucosidic linkage, it is not expected to form a smooth helical structure like amylose, but to form a relatively irregular structure. This wide and shallow cleft might be suitable for such an irregular structured substrate. Dimer structure and crystal packing There are two molecules of TVAII, Mol-1 and Mol-2, in an asymmetric unit and they interact with each other to form a dimer structure having non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry, as shown in Figure 8. Domain N participates in the main interactions between Mol-1 and Mol-2, as listed in Table 3. The hydrophobic groove of domain N formed by b1N and b7N is almost covered with the residues from another molecule in order to avoid exposing this region on the solvent-accessible surface. The hydrophobic groove of domain N

is thought to be one of the driving forces for the dimer structure formation. Domain N of Mol-2 is located close to domain B of Mol-1, but it does not seem to cover the area accessible for substrate binding of Mol-1. Interestingly, none of the domain N residues from Mol-2 have short contacts with the superimposed b-CD in the active site of Mol-1, as shown in Figure 7(a). A residue (Tyr45) of domain N from Mol-2 is indicated by an asterisk in Figure 6(a). Therefore, it is most likely that TVAII still has its enzyme activity even when it forms such a dimer structure. A dimer (Dimer-1) of TVAII is surrounded by three crystallographic symmetry operated dimers (Dimers-2, 3, and 4) in a crystal. Symmetry operations for them are (Àx  0.5, Ày  0.5, z  0.5) for Dimer-2, (Àx  1.0, y  0.5, Àz  1.5) for Dimer-3 and (x  0.5, Ày  0.5, Àz  1.0) for Dimer-4. Dimer-1 forms hydrogen bond interactions with only Dimer-2, as listed in Table 3, and forms a few hydrophobic interactions with Dimer-2 and Dimer4. Dimer-1 has no contact with Dimer-3 and its translated ones along crystallographic axes, and there is a large solvent channel between Dimers-1 and 3. There are not as many intermolecular interactions between Dimers-1, 2, 3 and 4 as between Mol-1 and Mol-2. Thus, the interactions between Mol-1 and Mol-2 are thought to be unusually strong as the intermolecular interactions between molecules in a crystal.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization Enzyme preparation and crystallization have been already reported (Kamitori et al., 1995). However, the crystallization conditions were modi®ed because phosphate buffer does not favor the preparation of heavy atom derivatives. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method, using a solution of 2 % (w/v) polyethyleneglycol (PEG) 6000 and 2.5 mM of CaCl2 in 20 mM Mes buffer (pH 6.1) as the reservoir. Crystallization drops were prepared by mixing TVAII solution (20 mg/ml) with an equal amount of the reservoir solution, and maintaining the mixture at 11 C. Prismatic shaped crys-

various concentrations. Crystals were soaked in heavy atom solutions, and 24 to 48 hours later diffraction data were collected and compared with those of native. After several attempts, 1 mM C2H5Hg and 1 mM Pb(CH3COO)2 derivatives were found to be useful for phase determination.

Structure solution Four positions of Hg atoms were determined from the difference Patterson map of Native-1 and C2H5Hg derivative, and the parameters were re®ned using 20Ê 3.0 A resolution data by the program Xheavy (McRee, 1993) in the XtalView system. To obtain initial phases, single isomorphous replacement (SIR; Wang, 1985) Ê against 20-3.0 A resolution data was carried out, using the program DM (Cowtan, 1994) in the CCP4 program suite. The solvent content was assumed to be 50 % for the calculation. After ten cycles of solvent ¯attening, the calculated electron density map clearly showed that two molecules are in an asymmetric unit, related by noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry (NCS). Six positions of Pb atoms were found in the difference Fourier map with coef®cients (FPb À Fnative) and the phases from the SIR of C2H5Hg derivative. After re®nement of Pb parameters Ê using 20-3.8 A resolution data, multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) phases were calculated by the program MLPHARE (Otwinowski, 1991) in the CCP4 program suite. The overall ®gure of merit was 0.51 for Ê 11,572 paired re¯ections in 20-3.8 A resolution data, and the phases were re®ned and extended by ten cycles of Ê solvent ¯attening, using 20-3.0 A resolution data. Heavy atom derivative statistics are given in Table 4. Although a-helices and b-strands could be found in the electron density map with the resulting phases, the quality of the phases was not suf®cient to enable interpretation of the loop regions. In order to improve the phases, electron density map averaging between the NCS-related molecules was performed. Initial rotation matrix was determined from positions of heavy atoms, and molecular mask was calculated by a locally developed program.

Data collection, processing and scaling Native (Native-1) and heavy atom derivative data were collected by a Rigaku R-AXIS IIc imaging plate system on a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode X-ray generator with monochromated CuKa radiation at room temperature (298 K). Initial cell and setting parameters for data collection were determined by R-AXIS data processing software using two still images (f  0  and 90  ; Higashi, 1990). The conditions for data collection were, camera length  150 mm, exposure time  60 minutes, delta f  1.5  , X-ray source  40 kV, 100 mA (®ne focused). Data processing and scaling between native and derivatives were carried out by R-AXIS data processing software and CCP4 program suite (CCP4, 1994). To obtain high-resolution data, cryogenic data collection was attempted for native crystal (Native-2). A crystal was stored in a 20 mM MES buffer solution (pH 6.1) with 15 % (w/v) of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 15 % (w/v) of PEG6000 for six hours. A crystal was picked and immediately frozen in a stream of evaporating nitrogen, and data were collected by R-AXIS IV imaging plate system at 113 K, using a Rigaku crystal cooling device. Data collection and processing conditions are almost the same as those of Native-1. The collected data and scaling results are listed in Table 4.

Structure of -Amylase Hydrolyzing Cyclodextrins (McRee, 1993) in the XtalView system, and then Mol-2 was generated by the NCS operation. The resulting Ê model was re®ned against 10.0-3.0 A resolution data È using the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1993) with positional protocol. At this stage, Mol-1 and Mol-2 were treated to be strictly identical by the NCS strict statement of X-PLOR, meaning that Mol-2 was generated from the re®ned structure of Mol-1 by the NCS operation. After 300 cycles of re®nement, an R-factor reduced from 0.452 to 0.271, and phases from the re®ned model and the DM procedure were combined by the program SIGMAA (Read, 1986) in the CCP4 program suite to generate an improved map. After several cycles of re®nement and phase combination, a model of 100 % amino acids with Ê an R-factor of 0.251 was re®ned against 10-2.8 A resolÈ ution data with stimulated annealing (Brunger et al., 1987) using slowcool protocol of X-PLOR without any restraints and constraints between the NCS molecules, giving an R-factor of 0.227. Then the model was re®ned Ê against 7.0-2.6 A resolution data of Native-2. After re®nement, a corrected model was rebuilt on the (2Fo À Fc) electron density map, and water molecules were gradually introduced if the peaks above 3.5s of the (Fo À Fc) difference Fourier electron density map were in the range of a hydrogen bond with the model. To avoid over®tting of the diffraction data, a free R-factor with È 10 % of the test set excluded from re®nement (Brunger, 1992) was monitored. After several cycles, a model with an R-factor of 0.204 was obtained. Protein Data Bank accession number The coordinates and structure factors of TVAII have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977) with reference ID codes of 1BVZ and 1BVZSF, respectively.
