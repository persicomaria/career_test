The architecture of G ÁG ÁGÁ G tetrad-aligned DNA quadruplexes in monovalent cation solution is dependent on the directionality of the four strands, which in turn are de®ned by loop connectivities and the guanine syn/anti distribution along individual strands and within individual GÁ GÁG ÁG tetrads. The smallest unimolecular G-quadruplex belongs to the d(G2NnG2NnG2NnG2) family, which has the potential to form two stacked G-tetrads linked by Nn loop connectivities. Previous studies have focused on the thrombin-binding DNA aptamer d(G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2), where Nn was T2 for the ®rst and third connecting loops and TGT for the middle connecting loop. This DNA aptamer in K cation solution forms a unimolecular G-quadruplex stabilized by two stacked G(syn)ÁG(anti)Á G(syn) ÁG(anti) tetrads, adjacent strands which are antiparallel to each other and edge-wise connecting T2, TGT and T2 loops. We now report on the NMR-based solution structure of the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence, which differs from the thrombin-binding DNA aptamer sequence in having longer ®rst (T4) and third (GT4) loops and a shorter (CA) middle loop. This d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence in Na cation solution forms a unimolecular G-quadruplex stabilized by two stacked G(syn) ÁG(syn)ÁG(anti)Á G(anti) tetrads, adjacent strands which have one parallel and one antiparallel neighbors and distinct non-edge-wise loop connectivities. Speci®cally, the longer ®rst (T4) and third (GT4) loops are of the diagonal type while the shorter middle loop is of the double chain reversal type. In addition, the pair of stacked GÁ GÁG ÁG tetrads are ¯anked on one side by a G Á(T-T) triad and on the other side by a T ÁT ÁT triple. The distinct differences in strand directionalities, loop connectivities and syn/anti distribution within GÁG ÁG ÁG tetrads between the thrombin-binding DNA aptamer d(G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2) quadruplex reported previously, and the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex reported here, reinforces the polymorphic nature of higher-order DNA architectures. Further, these two small unimolecular G-quadruplexes, which are distinct from each other and from parallel-stranded G-quadruplexes, provide novel targets for ligand recognition. Our results demonstrate that the double chain reversal loop connectivity identi®ed previously by our laboratory within the Tetrahymena telomere d(T2G4)4 quadruplex, is a robust folding topology, since it has now also been observed within the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex.

Introduction
Guanine-rich sequences in the presence of monovalent cations form G-quadruplexes stabilized by stacked G ÁG ÁGÁ G tetrad alignments1 (reviews2 ± 5). There is increasing evidence, primarily in vitro to date, linking G-quadruplexes to the regulation of a range of biological processes. Such G-quadruplexes could potentially form at the telomeric ends of human chromosomes,6 at sites of site-speci®c genetic recombination in immunoglobulin switch regions,7 within triplet repeat fragile-X syndrome disease sequences,8,9 during L1 retroposition10 and at sites associated with the IDDM2 diabetes susceptibility locus.11 Structural studies have established that G-quadruplexes are polymorphic and can adopt a range of folding topologies depending on strand directionalities, loop connectivities, and syn/anti distribution of guanine bases around GÁG ÁG ÁG tetrads. Three distinct families of loop connectivities characterize the folding topologies of G-quadruplexes. These can be classi®ed as edge-wise (Supplementary Material, Figure S1a), diagonal (Supplementary Material, Figure S1b) and double chain reversal (Supplementary Material, Figure S1c) loop connectivities. Adjacent strands are antiparallel to each other for an edge-wise loop connectivity9,12,}13 (Supplementary Material, Figure S1a) while a pair of adjacent strands are parallel to each other for a double chain reversal loop connectivity14 (Supplementary Material, Figure S1c). Opposing strands across the G-quadruplex are antiparallel to each other for a diagonal loop connectivity15 (Supplementary Material, Figure S1b). A minimum of two residues are required for forming an edgewise loop,16 ± 18 while three or more residues are required for forming a diagonal loop19 in a G-quadruplex. Surprisingly, two residues are suf®cient to generate a double chain reversal loop in a G-quadruplex.14 One of the ®rst G-quadruplex systems to be structurally characterized was the thrombinbinding d(G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2) DNA aptamer.19 Its consensus sequence contains four G2 steps which fold unimolecularly to form a G-quadruplex containing two stacked G ÁG ÁGÁ G tetrads in K  cation solution. Distinct features of the topology involved antiparallel alignment of adjacent strands, edgewise T2, TGT and T2 loops, alternating syn-anti steps alignments along individual G2 and syn Áanti ÁsynÁ anti alignments of guanine

bases around individual GÁG ÁG ÁG tetrads16 ± 18 (Figure 1(a)). A key feature de®ning the G-quadruplex architecture of the thrombin-binding DNA aptamer sequence was the length of the loop sequences. The ®rst and third loops consisted of short two base T2 segments, while the middle loop consisted of a longer three base TGT segment. All three loops adopt edge-wise connectivities and link adjacent antiparallel oriented strands around the G-quadruplex (Figure 1(a)). Here, we report on the consequences of changing the lengths of the connecting loops within the generic d(G2NnG2NnG2NnG2) sequence in efforts to identify new G-quadruplex folding topologies. The d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence reported here differs from the thrombinbinding d(G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2) sequence, in that the ®rst loop is longer (T4 rather than T2), the middle loop is shorter (CA rather than TGT) and the third loop is longer (GT4 rather than T2). Strikingly, the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence forms a totally different unimolecularly folded G-quadruplex containing two stacked G(syn) Á G(syn) ÁG(anti) ÁG(anti) tetrads, where the ®rst T4 and third GT4 loops are of the diagonal type and the second CA loop is of the double chain reversal type (Figure 1(b)). In addition, the pair of stacked G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrads are ¯anked on one side by a G Á(T-T) triad and on the other side by a T ÁT Á T triple (Figure 1(c)).

Results
NMR spectra We have recorded the proton NMR spectra of d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) and a range of guanine to inosine and 8-bromoguanine analogs to identify those sequences that gave the highest resolution NMR spectra necessary for structural characterization. The highest quality proton NMR spectra were obtained for the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) analogs where G2 was replaced by inosine I2, or where G1 was substituted by 8-bromo-G1. The resonance assignments were undertaken on the I2-labeled analog, while the NOE buildups for structure determination were undertaken on the 8-bromo-G1 analog. The proton spectrum (6.0 to 15.0 ppm) of the I2substituted d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence in 0.15 M NaCl, H2O buffer (pH 6.8), 0  C is plotted in Figure 2(a). The corresponding spectrum of the 8-bromo-G1-substituted analog is plotted in

Supplementary Material, Figure S2(a). The proton resonance assignment process was facilitated by systematic studies of a range of analogs. These included inosine for guanine (positions G1, G2, G7, G8, G12, G13, G18 and G19) substitutions, 8-bromoguanine for guanine (positions G1, G2, G7, G8, G11, G12, G13, G18 and G19) substitutions, 8-bromoadenine for adenine (A10) substitution, 2,6-dia-

minopurine for adenine (A10) substitution, uracil for thymine (T3, T4, T6, T15 and T17) substitutions, 5-bromouracil for thymine (T4, T5, T6, T15, T16 and T17) substitutions, and 5-methylcytosine for cytosine (C9) substitution. These analogs are listed in Table 1, with those that gave NOE patterns characteristic of a folded architecture marked with a plus symbol, those that failed to form the folded

state marked with a minus symbol, and those that were inconclusive as to folded state formation by a Æ symbol. Exchangeable proton assignments We observe narrow imino and somewhat broader amino protons between 8.5 and 14.5 ppm in the I2-substituted analog of d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) (Figure 2(a)). The spectrum corresponds to one predominant species, with excellent resolution in both the exchangeable (8.4 to 15.0 ppm) and nonexchangeable (6.0 to 9.0 ppm) proton regions. The imino and amino protons have been assigned following site-speci®c modi®cation of bases, as well as analysis of site-speci®c 13C,15N-labeled guanine and adenine containing samples and uniform

13 C,15N-labeled thymine and adenine containing samples. The observable guanine imino protons can be distinguished from their thymine imino proton counterparts by recording a natural abundance 1 H,15N-HSQC correlation spectrum of the I2 substituted DNA oligomer. The guanine imino nitrogen atoms resonate about 145 ppm and can be readily distinguished from the thymine imino nitrogen atoms, which resonate about 156 ppm (Supplementary Material, Figure S3). We have assigned individual guanine imino protons in the spectrum through site-speci®c 13C,15N-labeling of the guanine ring. To facilitate the process, site-speci®c labeling was done simultaneously at two purines in the sequence, one of which was 15N-labeled at the guanine N1, N2 and N7 positions (designated

G-quadruplex with Unusual Loop Connectivities

185 at C2) in the sequence (Figure 3(a)). Such an approach permits differentiation of the imino protons of G1 and G8 as identi®ed in Figures 3(a) and (b). In addition, one can also identify the H8 protons of G1 and G8 through the 1H8-15N7 two bond correlation cross-peaks (Figure 3(c)). These results, together with the corresponding data on the other three-site-speci®cally labeled I2 substituted DNA oligomers have permitted assignment of the sevensite speci®cally labeled guanine bases. Their imino proton assignments are as follows: G1 (12.11 ppm), G7 (12.13 ppm), G8 (12.07 ppm), G11 (12.43 ppm), G12 (11.54 ppm), G13 (9.40 ppm) and G18 (11.29 ppm), and are tabulated together with available guanine amino proton assignments in Supplementary Material, Table S1. It should be noted that the imino protons of G1, G2 (resonates at 11.64 ppm in the parent sequence), G7, G8, G11, G12, G18 and G19 (12.49 ppm) resonate between 11.3 and 12.5 ppm, a region characteristic of guanine imino protons involved in G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrad formation.20 By contrast, the imino proton of G13 has shifted up®eld to 9.40 ppm.

G#) (Supplementary Material, Figure S4a) and the other was 15N-labeled at the guanine/adenine N1, N2/N6 and N7 positions and 13C-labeled at the guanine C2/adenine C8 position (designated G*/ A*) (Supplementary Material, Figures S4b and S4c). Four such I2 substituted DNA oligomer sequences were prepared with site-speci®c labeling at G1# and G8*, at G13# and A10*, at G7# and G11*, and at G12# and G18*. This approach can provide assignments of guanine imino (one bond 1 H1-15N1 coupling), amino (one bond 1H2-15N2 coupling) and H8 (two bond 1H8-15N7 coupling) protons and adenine amino (one bond 1H6-15N6 coupling) and H8 (two bond 1H8-15N7 coupling) protons. The experimental data for the I2 substituted DNA oligomer with site-speci®c labeling at G1# and G8* is plotted in Figure 3(a)-(c). The 1H,15NHSQC spectrum exhibits two 1H1-15N1 one bond correlation cross-peaks originating from the G1 and G8 residues (15N-labeled at N1) in the sequence (Figure 3(b)). The 1H,13C-HSQC spectrum exhibits one 1H1-13C2 two bond correlation crosspeak originating from the G8 residue (13C-labeled

The heteronuclear correlation data shown in (a) to (c) were recorded on the I2-substituted d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex in which G1 was 15N-labeled at the N1, N2 and N7 positions and G8 was 15Nlabeled at the N1, N2 and N7 positions and 13C-labeled at the C2 position in H2O buffer (pH 6.8) at 0  C.

The H3:N1 spectrum was acquired using a H3N1C2N1(t1) C2 N1H3(t2) transfer scheme and the H6:N1 spectrum was acquired using a H6C6N1C6H6(t2) pathway. Assignments to individual thymine bases are listed in the Figure.

186 We replaced eight guanine bases one at a time by inosine bases in the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence. Four of these inosine substitutions, at positions G1, G2, G13 and G19, gave NMR spectra indicative of retention of the folded architecture (Table 1). Down®eld shifts were observed for this subset of imino protons on inosine for guanine substitution, with an average magnitude of 2.74(Æ0.41) ppm. There are nine thymine bases in the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence, four of them in the ®rst potential loop segment, four others in the third potential loop segment and the 3H -terminal thymine. The assignment of these thymine bases required the enzymatic preparation of a sample of I2-substituted d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T), uniformly 13 C,15N-labeled at all thymine bases in the sequence. We have assigned the seven observable thymine imino protons by correlating them with their assigned thymine non-exchangeable H6 protons (see below), as mediated through their intervening N1 nitrogen atoms (Figure 3(d)) or C4 carbon atoms (Supplementary Material, Figure S5). There is suf®cient resolution of the thymine N1 nitrogen atoms (Figure 3(d)) and C4 carbon atoms (Supplementary Material, Figure S5) to obtain de®nitive assignments. Their imino proton assignments are as follows: T3 (9.28 ppm), T4 (8.60 ppm), T5 (8.92 ppm), T14 (10.80 ppm), T16 (11.17 ppm), T17 (10.89 ppm) and T20 (11.47 ppm), and are given in Supplementary Material, Table S1. It should be noted that the imino protons of T3, T4 and T5 which resonate between 8.6 and 9.3 ppm exhibit unusual up®eld chemical shifts compared to the imino protons of T14, T16, T17 and T20 which resonate between 10.8 and 11.5 ppm. We replaced six thymine bases one at a time by 5-bromouracil groups in the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence. Four of these thymine substitutions, at positions T5, T6, T15 and T17, gave NMR spectra indicative of retention of the folded architecture (Table 1). Down®eld shifts were observed for this subset of imino protons on 5-bromouracil for thymine substitution, with an average magnitude of 0.52(Æ0.02) ppm. The observed pattern of chemical shift changes on 5-bromouracil for thymine substitution provides a potentially useful approach for thymine imino proton assignments. Non-exchangeable proton assignments We have assigned the non-exchangeable base and sugar protons following analysis of NOESY, COSY and TOCSY data sets on the I2-substituted analog of d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence in 0.15 NaCl, 2H2O buffer (pH 6.8) at 5  C. This analysis was facilitated by the assignment of purine H8 protons (based on two bond 15N7-H8 coupling) deduced from pair-wise site-speci®c 15N-labeling of seven guanine bases and one adenine in the four I2-substituted DNA oligomers mentioned in an earlier section. The assignment of the purine H8

G-quadruplex with Unusual Loop Connectivities

protons was also facilitated by the chemical shift change patterns associated with inosine/8-bromoguanine for guanine substitutions and 2,6-diaminopurine for adenine substitution in the sequence (Table 1). Similarly, the assignment of pyrimidine H6 protons was facilitated by the chemical shift change patterns associated with uracil/5-bromouracil for thymine substitutions and 5-methylcytosine for cytosine substitution in the sequence (Table 1). An expanded NOESY (250 ms mixing time) contour plot of the I2 substituted DNA oligomer correlating base protons with the sugar H1H protons is plotted in Figure 4(b). We can trace NOE connectivities between the base protons and their own and 5H -¯anking sugar H1H protons from G1 to T20 along the sequence. We observe weak or absent base proton to their 5H -¯anking sugar H1H proton NOEs at the T4-T5 and T6-G7 steps associated with the ®rst T4 segment, at the G8-C9, C9-A10 and A10-G11 steps associated with the central CA segment, at the G12-G13 step and at T14-T15, T15T16 and T17-G18 associated with the last T4 segment (Figure 4(b)). We observe a strong base to their own sugar H1H NOEs for the G1, G7, G11 and G18 residues, of comparable intensity to the NOE for the H5-H6 protons of C9 at short (50 ms) mixing times, consistent with these four guanines adopting syn alignments21 in the folded state (contour and stacked plots for NOESY data at 50 ms mixing time for the 8-bromo-G1 substituted analog is plotted in Supplementary Material, Figure S6). The proton chemical shifts of the base and sugar protons of I2-substituted and 8-bromo-G1 substituted d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) are listed in Supplementary Material, Tables S1 and S2, respectively. G Á G ÁG ÁG tetrad formation We observe a pattern of NOEs highly characteristic of GÁG ÁGÁ G tetrad formation in the NOESY (200 ms mixing time) data set of the I2 substituted d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence in 0.15 NaCl, H2O buffer (pH 6.8) at 0  C. An expanded contour plot outlining NOEs between guanine imino and guanine H8 protons is plotted in Figure 2(b) and the corresponding data for 8-bromo-G1 substituted d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence is plotted in Supplementary Material, Figure S2b. We observe NOEs between the imino proton of G1 and the H8 proton of G18 (peak 5, Figures 2(b) and Supplementary Material, Figure S2b), the imino proton of G18 and the H8 proton of G8 (peak 8, Figure 2(b) and Supplementary Material, Figure S2b), the imino proton of G8 and the H8 proton of G12 (peak 6, Figure 2(b) and Supplementary Material, Figure S2b), and between the imino proton of G12 and the H8 proton of G1 (peak 7, Figure 2(b)), This pattern is characteristic of G1 ÁG18 ÁG8 Á G12 tetrad formation and de®nes the directionality of guanine Watson-Crick edge to guanine Hoogsteen edge alignments around the tetrad (see schematic in Figure 1(c)).

(a) An expanded NOESY (200 ms mixing time) contour plot correlating NOEs between imino and amino protons (8.5 to 14.5 ppm) to base and sugar 1H protons (5.0 to 10.0 ppm; 1.5 to 2.5 ppm) in the I2-substituted d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex in H2O buffer (pH 6.8) at 0  C. Key NOE cross-peaks between non-adjacent residues are boxed and assigned in the contour plot. (b) An expanded NOESY (250 ms mixing time) contour plot for the I2-substituted d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex in 2H2O buffer (pH 6.8) at 5  C. NOEs between base protons (7.0 to 9.0 ppm) and sugar H1H protons (5.2 to 6.8 ppm). Lines trace the sequential walk between base protons and their own and 5H -¯anking sugar H1H protons from G1 to T20. We observe strong cross-peaks for guanine H8 to their own sugar H1H protons for G1, G7, G11 and G18, and these persist in short (50 ms) mixing time data. The chemical shifts of the H2 protons of I2 and A10 are indicated by broken lines. The H6-H5 cytosine crosspeak of C9 is indicated by an asterisk.

We also observe NOEs between the imino proton of I2/G2 and the H8 proton of G11 (peak 1, Figure 2(b) and Supplementary Material, Figure S2b), the imino proton of G11 and the H8 proton of G7 (peak 3, Figure 2(b) and Supplementary Material, Figure S2b), the imino proton of G7 and the H8 proton of G19 (partially resolved peak 4, Figure 2(b)), and between the imino proton of

G19 and the H8 proton of I2 (peak 2, Figure 2(b)), This pattern is characteristic of G2/I2 ÁG11 ÁG7 ÁG19 tetrad formation and de®nes the directionality of guanine Watson-Crick edge to guanine Hoogsteen edge alignments around the tetrad (see schematic in Figure 1(c)). The identi®cation of G1 ÁG18 ÁG8 Á G12 and G2 Á G11 ÁG7 ÁG19 tetrads establishes that the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T)

188 sequence forms a unimolecular quadruplex containing a pair of stacked G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrads in solution. NOE patterns between non-adjacent residues We observe a pattern of NOEs between nonadjacent residues in the sequence which re¯ect aspects of the stacking between adjacent G1 ÁG18 ÁG8Á G12 and G2 ÁG11 ÁG7 ÁG19 tetrads, as well as the relationship between the ®rst T4 loop, the second CA loop and the third GT4 loop with each other and the two tetrad planes in the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex. A subset of these NOEs are assigned in expanded NOESY contour plots of the I2-substituted DNA oligomer recorded in H2O buffer (Figure 4(a)) and in 2H2O buffer (Figure 4(b) and Supplementary Material, Figure S7). As an example, the up®eld shifted imino protons of T3 (9.28 ppm) and T4 (8.60 ppm) exhibit NOEs to the sugar H1H protons of T20 (6.67 ppm), as shown in Figure 4(a). Similarly, in the base-to-base proton region, the strongest NOE is observed between the H8 protons of G7 and A10 as shown in Supplementary Material, Figure S7. The observed NOEs between non-adjacent residues (a subset of which are listed in Supplementary Material, Table S3) were critical for the identi®cation of base triple and base triad alignments and their stacking on adjacent G-tetrads (see Discussion) in the folded structure of the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex. Input restraints and structure calculations The structure calculations were undertaken with distance and intensity restraints on the 8-bromoG1-substituted d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex. Distance restraints on the exchangeable pro-

G-quadruplex with Unusual Loop Connectivities

tons were qualitatively deduced from NOESY experiments in H2O solution at three mixing times, and distance restraints on nonexchangeable protons were quanti®ed from NOE buildup curves in 2H2O at ®ve mixing times. The 20-mer strand was aligned by hydrogen bonding restraints that de®ne the experimentally identi®ed G1(syn) Á G18(syn) ÁG8(anti) ÁG12(anti) and G2(anti) Á G11(syn) ÁG7(syn)ÁG19(anti) tetrads (hydrogen bond directionalities are shown schematically in Figure 1(c)). Solution structures of the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex were calculated using a distance geometry and molecular dynamics approach including intensity re®nement (protocols are outlined in Materials and Methods). The type and number of NMR restraints are listed in Table 2. Ten structures were selected out of 100 starting structures after metrix matrix distance geometry and simulated annealing (DGSA) regularization on the basis of their low covalent energy and their low input-restraint violations. These ten structures were initially re®ned against distance restraints and subsequently re®ned against intensity restraints deduced from NOESY data sets as a function of mixing times. Solution structure A stereo view of ten superpositioned intensity re®ned structures of the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex are plotted in Figure 5(a) and exhibit pair-wise heavy atom root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) values for all residues of 1.07(Æ0.07) (Table 2). The rmsd values at individual base and backbone residues within the quadruplex are plotted in Supplementary Material, Figure S8a and S8b, respectively. One representative intensity re®ned structure of the quadruplex is plotted in stereo in Figure 5(b). The intramolecularly folded

Discussion
The current study on the unimolecular d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex with its two diagonal and one double chain reversal loops (Figure 1(b)), contrasts with the earlier study of the unimolecular d(G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2) thrombin binding DNA aptamer19 where all three loops are of the edge-wise type (Figure 1(a)).16 ± 18 Both quadru-

plexes involve two stacked G-tetrads, but differ in all three loop connectivities, the guanine syn/anti distributions around the G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrads and the relative directionalities of adjacent strands around the G-quadruplex. We discuss below the pairing alignments and guanine syn/anti distributions of the two G-tetrads, the G Á(T-T) triad and the T Á T ÁT triple, as well as the overlap patterns and the loop topologies within the unimolecular d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex. G(syn) ÁG(syn)ÁG(anti)Á G(anti) tetrads The core of the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex is made up of stacked G1(syn)ÁG18(syn) ÁG8(anti)ÁG12(anti) and G2(anti)ÁG11 Á(syn) ÁG7(syn) ÁG19(anti) tetrads. Such a pattern of

stacked G(syn) ÁG(syn)Á G(anti) ÁG(anti) tetrads is consistent with a G-quadruplex architecture where each strand has both a parallel and an antiparallel neighbor (Figure 1(b) and Supplementary Material, Figure S1b). Such a pattern of syn/anti distribution and relative strand orientation has been reported for G-quadruplexes formed by the dimeric d(G4T4G4)15 and unimolecular d(G4T4G4T4 G4T4G4)22,31 Oxytricha telomeric sequences, the unimolecular d(AG3[T2AG3]3) human telomeric sequence19 and the tetrameric d(TAG3) Bombyx mori telomeric sequence.23 An analysis of NOE patterns that de®ne the relative stacking of the adjacent G(syn) ÁG(syn)Á G(anti) ÁG(anti) tetrads is discussed in the text of the Supplementary Material.

G-quadruplex with Unusual Loop Connectivities

191 d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex (Figure 1(c)). The ®rst example of a diagonal loop connecting the edges of a G-quadruplex emerged from studies of the dimeric d(G4T4G4) Oxytricha telomeric quadruplex.15 Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of one diagonal and two edge-wise loops in the unimolecular d(AG3[T2AG3]3) human telomeric19 and unimolecular d(G4T4G4T4G4T4G4) Oxytricha telomeric22,31 G-quadruplexes. The identi®cation of two diagonal loops in the present study on the unimolecular d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex was unanticipated and stresses the diversity of loop connectivities in G-quadruplexes. C9-A10 double chain reversal loop The most striking feature of the structure of the unimolecular d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex is the presence of a double chain reversal loop at the C9-A10 step (Figure 5 and Supplementary Material, Figure S10), that connects the G7-G8 and G11-G12 edges of the G-quadruplex (Figure 1(c)). Thus, two residues are suf®cient to span two stacked G-tetrads and connect adjacent parallelaligned strands. A double chain reversal loop has been identi®ed previously within the solution structure of unimolecular d(T2G4)4 Tetrahymena telomeric G-quadruplex14 and, more recently, a single adenine which participates in A Á(G ÁG ÁG ÁG) ÁA hexad formation, was found to connect two adjacent parallel-aligned strands involving two stacked G-tetrads.27 Thus, double chain reversal loops, which spans one of the four grooves of the G-quadruplex, appear to be a robust turn motif. The orientation of the C9 and A10 residues is primarily de®ned by sequential NOEs (Supplementary Material, Table S3) within the G8-C9-A10-G11 segment (see the text in Supplementary Material). The C9 and A10 base planes are parallel to each other and to the quadruplex helical axis (Figure 5 and Supplementary Material, Figure S10), and are available for recognition. Biological implications One of the goals of our research has been the identi®cation of new folding topologies and the establishment of the robustness of existing topologies in multi-stranded DNA architectures. In this regard, the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex contains many novel features that emphasize the polymorphic nature of DNA folding topologies. Thus, this is the ®rst example of a unimolecular quadruplex containing two diagonal loops. Strikingly, segments of both diagonal loops involve novel topologies, consistent with three base-pairing alignments stabilized through stacking on planar G-tetrads. In one case involving a GT4 diagonal loop, a G Á(T-T) triad is readily accommodated over a G-tetrad, expanding on three other examples of isolated triads stabilized through stacking over Gtetrad template planes.23,26,28 In the second case

G13 Á(T16-T17) triad A segment of the ®ve base G13-T14-T15-T16-T17 loop forms a G13 Á(T16-T17) triad, containing a T-T platform (Figure 6(a)). The triad could be stabilized by a potential hydrogen bond between the amino group of G13 and O2 carbonyl of T16, as shown in Figure 6(a). The concept of a base triad was initially proposed by Kuryavyi & Jovin24,25 and isolated triads have subsequently been observed within both DNA and RNA folding topologies. Speci®c examples of DNA base triads include A Á(T-A),23 T Á(A-A),26 GÁ (A-G)27 and G Á(C-A)28 triads. The G13 Á(T16-T17) triad and the G1 ÁG18 ÁG8 Á G12 tetrad are stacked on each other with the overlap pattern shown in Figure 6(e). We note that G12 and G13 stack on each other, as do G1 and T16, while T17 stacks over the center of the G8 ÁG18 mismatch pair (Figure 6(e)). The G13 Á(T16-T17) triad pairing alignment emerged from the structure calculations and was primarily de®ned by a set of NOEs (Supplementary Material, Table S3) between the G13 Á(T16-T17) triad and the G1 ÁG18 ÁG8Á G12 tetrad (see the text in Supplementary Material). T3 Á T5 ÁT20 triple A segment of the four base T3-T4-T5-T6 loop participates in T3 ÁT5 ÁT20 base triple formation (Figure 6(f)). The triple could be stabilized by potential hydrogen bonds between the imino proton of T5 and the O2 carbonyl of T3 and between the imino proton of T3 and the O2 carbonyl of T20, as shown in Figure 6(f). In this regard it should be noted that we do detect narrow imino protons for T5 (8.92 ppm) and T3 (9.28 ppm) which are postulated to participate in hydrogen bond formation, but not for T20 which is postulated not to participate in hydrogen bond formation (Figure 6(f)). The proposed T3 ÁT5 ÁT20 triple is unusual in that all three bases are pyrimidines, in contrast to previously reported purine-containing (pyrimidine Á purine) Ápyrimidine and (pyrimidine Ápurine) Á purine triples (reviews29,30). The T3 Á T5Á T20 triple and the G2ÁG11 ÁG7 ÁG19 tetrad are stacked on each other with the overlap pattern shown in Figure 6(f). We note that T5 and G11 stack on each other, as do T3 and G2, and T20 and G19 (Figure 6(f)). The T3 ÁT5 ÁT20 triple pairing alignment emerged from the structure calculations and was primarily de®ned by a set of NOEs (Supplementary Material, Table S3) between the T3 Á T5 ÁT20 triple and the G2 ÁG11 ÁG7 ÁG19 tetrad (see the text in Supplementary Material). Diagonal loops Diagonal loops are formed by the G13-T14-T15T16-T17 segment which connects the G11-G12 and G18-G19 edges and the T3-T4-T5-T6 segment which connects the G1-G2 and G7-G8 edges of the

192 involving a T4 diagonal loop, a T ÁT ÁT base triple is positioned over a G-tetrad, thus unexpectedly for the ®rst time stabilizing three pyrimidines in a plane. Even more striking is the presence of a tworesidue double chain reversal loop, with its sugarphosphate backbone nestled within the groove and its outwardly pointing bases available for recognition. Thus, the structure of G-quadruplexes and the established diversity of their multi-stranded architectures, could constitute key elements during molecular recognition events. G-quadruplexes can be recognized by ligands ranging from small molecules to proteins (Arimondo et al; Han et al.; and references therein).32,33 Much recent effort has addressed the issue of designing small ligands that bind G-quadruplexes due to their potential as antitumor agents with activity against the enzyme telomerase. Preliminary efforts have focused on both groove-binding34 and intercalative35 ± 39 ligands targeted to parallelstranded G-quadruplexes. These molecular recognition efforts could be expanded to non-parallelstranded G-quadruplexes,40 and would be most effectively implemented provided these architectures were inherently simple, associated with minimal size. It is our position that the unimolecular thrombin-binding DNA aptamer d(G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2) quadruplex reported previously,16 ± 18 where adjacent strands are antiparallel to each other, and the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex reported here, where adjacent strands are both parallel and antiparallel to each other, meet these criteria and these simple two GÁ GÁG ÁG tetrad containing systems will serve as additional targets for G-quadruplex-recognizing ligands.

G-quadruplex with Unusual Loop Connectivities tuted analogs (Table 1), as well as site-speci®c and uniformly 13C,15N-labeled material were recorded on Varian Unity Inova 600 MHz NMR spectrometers in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM sodium-phosphate (pH 6.8). NOESY and 1H-15N-HSQC spectra were recorded in H2O buffer and NOESY, DQF-COSY, COSY45 and TOCSY spectra were recorded in 2H2O buffer at 5  C. Two-dimensional NMR data collection and processing parameters have been reported.27 Distance and torsion restraints NOE cross-peaks involving exchangeable protons in NOESY spectra (50 and 200 ms mixing times) in H2O buffer were classi®ed as strong (strong intensity at 50 ms), medium (weak intensity at 50 ms), and weak (peak observed only at 200 ms), and the corresponding Ê proton pairs were restrained to distances of 2.5(Æ1.5) A, Ê Ê 3.5(Æ1.5) A and 4.5(Æ1.5) A, respectively. NOE buildups for non-exchangeable protons were derived from NOESY spectra in 2H2O buffer recorded as a function of mixing time (50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 ms). The thymine Ê (H-6)-(CH3-5) distance of 2.99 A was used as a reference distance (with (rÀ3)À1/3 averaging for methyl protons) for calibrating initial slopes to inter-proton-distance restraints. The upper and lower bounds were uniformly assigned to Æ20 % of the estimated distances. Atoms participating in experimentally identi®ed (based on NOE patterns) hydrogen bond alignments within the G ÁGÁ GÁ G tetrad planes were restrained with distances corresponding to ideal hydrogen bond geometry. We restrained individual hydrogen bonds with two distance (heavy atom-heavy atom and heavy atomproton) restraints.43 Two dihedral angle restraints were used to restrict each glycosidic torsion angle (w) to either 240(Æ70) for experimentally assigned anti residues or 60(Æ30) for experimentally assigned syn residues. The g torsion angle was restrained to cis 60(Æ30) for G2, G8, G12 and G19 residues. The e angle was restrained to 225(Æ75) for all residues consistent with stereochemically allowed range for this angle. The restraining force constant for all torsion angles was 50 kcal molÀ1 radÀ2. Distance geometry and simulated annealing regularization Metric matrix distance geometry calculations were performed with the program X-PLOR44 to embed and optimize 100 initial structures. For optimization with simulated annealing (DGSA protocol), all distance restraints were speci®ed with the R-6 averaging option in X-PLOR because of the unique atom speci®cation in input distance restraints. Fourteen structures were identi®ed based on the criterion of acceptable covalent geometry, low distance restraint violations, and favorable nonbonded energy. The variation in energies within this subset of structures was 46 kcal molÀ1 and was separated from the remaining structures by a gap of 200 kcal molÀ1. The ten best structures from this subset of 14 were further optimized with restrained molecular dynamics simulations. Distance-restrained molecular dynamics Distance-restrained molecular dynamics (X-PLOR program)44 was carried out with a distance-dependent dielectric constant. The distance-restrained dynamics
