Chemical modifications of Class I aldolases from Trypanosoma brucei, rabbit muscle and Staphylococcus aureus with carboxypeptidase A, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and cysteine-specific reagents revealed the following differences between the three homologous enzymes. Aldolase from S. aureus was not affected by any of these reagents. Carboxypeptidase-Atreatment of rabbit-muscle and T. brucei aldolase inhibited the activity of both enzymes towards fructose- 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru(1,6)P2), while the activity towards fructose-l-phosphate (Fru-l-P) was affected only in the case of the trypanosomal enzyme. Moreover carboxypeptidase-A treatment reduced the turnover numbers of these two aldolases for both Fru(1,6)P2 and Fru- 1-P to a similar level. Glyceraldehyde 3phosphate, in the absence of dihydroxyacetone phosphate, also inactivated aldolases from rabbit muscle and T. brucei with second order rate constants of 1054 and 254 rain ~M ~,respectively. Using 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoicacid) with rabbit-muscle aldolase, a total of 4 thiol groups could be titrated per subunit, resulting in a total inactivation. The presence of substrate completely protected the enzyme from inactivation. Methyl methanethiosulfonate also reacted with four cysteine residues, but this led to very little inactivation. This indicates that the inactivation by modification with DTNB is due to conformational changes in the enzyme. In T. brucei aldolase only one thiol group could be titrated with methyl methanesulfonate and there was no loss of activity. With 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) five cysteines were titrated with an immediate and complete loss of activity. In the presence of substrate, the inactivation was not prevented but the reactivity of the thiol groups was reduced and one thiol group was protected from reaction.

Reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid).
The reaction of aldolase with DTNB (Sigma) was carried out at 25°C in 0.1 M triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.6/1 mM EDTA (non-denaturating conditions), or in 1% SDS/0.1 M triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.6/1 mM EDTA (denaturating conditions) with excess of reagent (1 mM DTNB). The number of thiol groups was calculated by the formation of 5nitro-2-thiobenzoate using an e of 13.6 10 3 M -~ cm I at 412 nm [2]. For assay of enzymatic activity, aliquots (5 ~tl) of this modification mixtures were transferred to the assay mixtures. For thiol-titration experiments, crystalline suspensions of aldolase were centrifuged and dissolved in 0.1. M triethanolamine buffer/1 mM EDTA/1 mM dithiothreitol (Serva), pH 7.6 for at least 1 h. Dithiothreitol was removed by elution of the enzyme from a Sephadex G-25 column with titration buffer prior to titration.

Reaction with methyl methanethiosulfonate.

The reaction of aldolase with methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) (Sigma) was carried out at 25°C in 0.1 M triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.6/1 mM EDTA, with a maximal molar ratio (MMTS/aldolase) of 10. Aliquots (5 ~tl) were taken at different time intervals and assayed for enzymatic activity. After reaction with MMTS, excess of MMTS was removed by dialysis and the enzyme was titrated with 1 mM DTNB to calculate the number of unblocked cysteine residues.
Results

ferences between the three enzymes (Fig. 1). The removal of the carboxy-terminal tyrosine residue from rabbit-muscle aldolase by carboxypeptidase A resulted in a dramatic decrease of the rate of cleavage of Fru(1,6)P2. However, the rate of cleavage of Fru-1-P was barely modified. In the case of aldolase from S. aureus, the rate of cleavage of neither Fru(1,6)P2 nor Fru-1-P was affected. By contrast, the activity of aldolase from T. brucei towards both substrates was considerably decreased after carboxypeptide-A treatment. However, the inactivation rate for cleavage of Fru(1,6)P2 was faster than for the cleavage of Fru-l-P. Using a 10-fold higher concentration of carboxy-peptidase A, the half-life of inactivation with Fru(1,6)P_2 as substrate of both rabbit-muscle and T. brucei aldolase was about one min. The activity of the rabbit-muscle enzyme with Fru- 1-P was reduced to 70% of the original activity within 5 min, whereas that of the T. brucei enzyme was reduced to 20% within 10 min.

Fig. 2. Effect of DL-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate on the activity with Fru(1,6)P2 of aldolase from T. brucei (e), rabbit muscle (o) and S. aureus (A). The reaction mixture contained 10 ~tM aldolase and 24 ~tM glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (-) or 786 ~M glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (---) in 0.1 M triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.6.

uct. This process is facilitated by binding of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to the C6-phosphate binding site [4]. Fig. 2 shows that aldolase from S. aureus was not inactivated by glyceraldehyde 3phosphate, while the rabbit-muscle enzyme was more sensitive than the trypanosomal enzyme to the triosephosphate. In the presence of a small excess of dihydroxy-acetone phosphate, the inhibition by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was totally prevented for both aldolases (data not shown). Plots of the logarithm of remaining activity versus time yielded pseudo first order kinetics. The rate constants of inactivation plotted versus the glyceraldehyde-phosphate concentration revealed saturation kinetics, indicating that a reversible enzymeglyceraldehyde-phosphate complex is formed prior to irreversible inactivation (data not shown). Both the maximal rate of inactivation of aldolase (0.028 min -~ for rabbit muscle and 0.019 min -1 for T. brucei) and the affinity of aldolase towards DLglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (27 ~tM for rabbit muscle and 74 ~tM for T. brucei) were significantly higher for the mammalian enzyme. Modification of cysteine residues with thiol specific reagents. In this study the reactivity of aldolase towards SH-groups was investigated in order to identify differences in the respective aldolase struc-

tures. The results obtained with T. brucei aldolase are summarized in Table I. Titration of sulfhydryl groups in native aldolase from T. brucei with DTNB revealed the presence of 5 exposed SH-groups per subunit. Two thiol groups reacted instantaneously and the modification rate of the 3 other groups was rather slow. Modification of one thiol group was prevented by both Fru(1,6)P2 and Fru-l-P and the reactivity of the other thiol groups was further reduced. In the presence of Fru( 1,6)P2 still one SH-group reacted immediately and the modification rate of the other thiols showed biphasic kinetics. Only in the presence of Fru-1-P was the time course of modification slow enough to follow the modification of all groups. The semilogarithmic plot of the modified groups per subunit versus time yielded a triphasic process. The decrease in reaction rate was not an effect of the high Fru-1-P concentration on the reactivity of DTNB, since the reaction rate of DTNB with dithiothreitol in both the absence or presence of 100 mM Fru-1 -P was exactly the same. Under denaturing conditions (1% SDS) 9 cysteine residues were titrated (not shown) which is in agreement with the nine cysteines found in the amino acid sequence [5,6]. Aldolase from T. brucei was totally inactivated immediately after the addition of DTNB. Neither Fru(1,6)P2 nor Fru-1-P could protect the enzyme from inactivation. However, the inactivation was significantly slowed down in the presence of 100 mM Fru- 1-P. Titration of rabbit-muscle aldolase with DTNB under non-denaturing conditions revealed the presence of four accessible thiol groups per subunit while under denaturing conditions eight thiol groups per subunit reacted. 1.6 thiol group reacted immediately, and the rate constant of modification, 0.16 min -], was clearly higher than for T. brucei aldolase, 0.04 min -j. Modification of the thiol groups, under non-denaturating conditions, led to a total loss of activity but with a half life of 5 min. In the case of aldolase from S. aureus titration with DTNB did not result in modification of any thiol groups, even in the presence of 1% SDS, and the enzymatic activity of this enzyme was not affected. More differences between aldolase from T. brucei and rabbit muscle were obtained after modification with MMTS. MMTS is highly selective, re-

Fig. 3. Reaction of aldolase from T. brucei with MMTS and titration of unblocked thiol groups with DTNB (o). Aldolase ( 10 ~M) was incubated with 50 ~tM MMTS for 1 h at 25°C. After the incubation period the residual activity (---) was measured and the samples were freed from MMTS and titrated with 1 mM DTNB (-). The control experiment was not treated with MMTS (e).

by DTNB with that of aldolase previously treated with MMTS revealed that MMTS had blocked the fast-reacting thiol group. Moreover the blocking of one group induced conformational changes which makes the other thiol groups more accessible. Immediately after addition of DTNB to MMTS-treated aldolase the activity was 90% inhibited. Hence inactivation of aldolase by DTNB and its reactivity towards the thiol groups were not at all correlated. After reaction of rabbit-muscle aldolase with MMTS, the enzyme still possessed 77% of its original activity while the four normally exposed thiol groups were blocked. Although DTNB did not react with any thiol groups of the MMTS-treated enzyme, the activity of the enzyme was further reduced to 50% by DTNB. Discussion Role of the C-terminus. Treatment with carboxypeptidase A results in removal of the carboxy-terminal tyrosine from aldolase [8-11 ]. In agreement with the literature [8,12,13] the activity of rabbitmuscle aldolase with Fru- 1-P remained essentially unchanged (Fig. 1) or could be partially inhibited (30% inhibition) depending on the carboxypeptidase concentration used. In contrast the activity of the T. brucei enzyme with Fru- 1-P as substrate was markedly inhibited by carboxypeptidase A, even at low concentrations.

acts rapidly and introduces only a relatively small non-hydrogen bonding methanethio (CH3S-) group into the enzyme [7]. Reaction of T. brucei aldolase with MMTS resulted in only a partial inactivation (20%). After completion of the reaction still 4 thiol groups could be modified with DTNB, indicating that only one SH-group per subunit had reacted with MMTS (Fig. 3 and Table I). A comparison of the time course of modification of native aldolase

15 When the turnover numbers for the cleavage of Fru(1,6)P2 and Fru-l-P after carboxypeptidase treatment of T. brucei aldolase (k(Fru(1,6)P2) = 24.7 min-1 and k(Fru-1-P) = 20.4 min -l) and of rabbit-muscle enzyme were calculated (k(Fru(1,6)P2) = 16.4 min -1 and k(Fru-l-P) = 11.5 min-1), and compared with those of the native enzymes [ 1], we noticed that the overall reaction rates after treatment were remarkably similar in spite of the considerable differences in activity measured between the native enzymes [1]. Similar turnover numbers could be calculated for the human aldolase isoenzymes A and B in which the tyrosine was replaced by serine [14]. Such similar reaction rates may indicate that after carboxypeptidase treatment or changing the tyrosine into a serine, both the cleavage reaction with Fru( 1,6)P2 and with Fru-1-P are limited by the same step in the overall reaction [ 15]. The conversion Fru(1,6)P2 o r Fru-1-P into triose phosphates can be written as follows[ 16]: E + Fru(1,6)P2 (Fru-l-P) E-D- + H+ ., " E-D- + glyceraldehyde 3phosphate (glyceraldehyde) (1) dihydroxyacetone phosphate + E (2) acid sequence. Rabbit-muscle and human aldolase A behave exactly the same towards carboxypeptidase-A treatment and they have exactly the same carboxy terminal sequence, H A Y [14,19]. In case of human aldolase B, with Y T Y as carboxy terminus, the tyrosine takes no role in catalysis but is involved in the stability of the enzyme [ 14]. The carboxy-terminal amino sequence ofT. brucei aldolase is N T Y [5] and the tyrosine is involved in both the cleavage of Fru(1,6)P2 and Fru-l-P. As reported by G6tz et al. [20], aldolase from S. aureus is insensitive to inactivation by carboxy-peptidase A, but the enzyme contains a carboxy-terminal lysine instead of tyrosine [21]. The higher activity of the native T. brucei aldolase for Fru- 1-P also suggests that binding of Fru- 1P induces a partial conformational change allowing the enzyme a higher overall rate and making it less dependent on an interaction of the C0-1ocus with a phosphate residue. Such an hypothesis would be consistent with the observed inhibition of the trypanosome enzyme by ATP. ATP of which the gamma phosphate group binds at the C6-active site region [22] acts as a competitive inhibitor. As described in the accompanying article [ 1], the affinity of rabbit-muscle aldolase towards ATP is 2.5 times higher than that for T. brucei aldolase and 3.6 times higher than for the bacterial enzyme. Moreover differences in inactivation of the three enzymes by incubation with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as a result of an interaction with the C6-phosphate binding site of the enzyme [4], also supports this hypothesis. The second order rate constant of inactivation of aldolase from T. brucei is 4 times less than the value for rabbit-muscle aldolase (254 vs. 1054 min-~ M-a), while the S. aureus enzyme is not inactivated (Fig. 2).
Sulfhydryl reactivity. It has been assumed by several investigators that cysteines were involved in the catalytic process of aldolase [23]. However, several observations argue strongly against such a direct involvement of a cysteine. (1) The alignment of amino-acid sequences of 13 different class I aldolases (ref. 19; P. Michels and R. Wierenga, unpublished results) in which there are no conserved cysteine residues. (2) The three-dimensional structure of rabbit-muscle aldolase which does not reveal the presence of any cysteine residue in the ac-

with the common intermediate of the two half-reactions being the eneamine of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (E-D-). According to Rose et al. [ 15-17] removal of the carboxy-terminal tyrosine does not affect the first step of the reaction (1) but it reduces the rate of protonation in the following step (2). We assume, as suggested by Morse and Horecker [ 18], that in the case of rabbit-muscle and human aldolase A (a) the binding of Fru(1,6)P2 to native aldolase induces a conformational change that leads to an increase in the rate of step (2); (b) Fru-1-P-binding is not able to induce such a conformational change; and (c) carboxypeptidase-A-treated enzyme can no longer undergo such a change. Thus, the carboxy-terminal tyrosine residue is necessary to maintain the active site in a conformation allowing an enhanced overall reaction rate. However, the differences in catalytic efficiency for the cleavage of Fru(1,6)P2 and Fru- 1-P depend not only on the carboxy-terminal tyrosine but are correlated with differences in the carboxy-terminal amino-

16 tive site [24]. (3) The substitution of Cys-72 and Cys-338 in human aldolase A into alanines by sitedirected mutagenesis which yielded mutant aldolase with the same activity as the wild type [ 14]. For rabbit-muscle aldolase it is known that there exist different classes of thiol groups [25-28] and our results confirm their existence. H o w e v e r modification with M M T S also demonstrated that none of them can be involved in the catalytic process itself, since blocking of all 4 exposed thiols with M M T S only caused a partial (20%) inhibition of activity. Therefore, the inactivation of rabbit-muscle aldolase by D T N B must have been the result of either conformational changes or of steric hindrance induced by the reagent. Indeed, we have shown that the interaction of D T N B with aldolase, even without reaction with thiol groups, causes partial inactivation. Modification of T. brucei aldolase with D T N B also revealed different types of cysteines. O f the 9 cysteines per subunit, 4 are buried and the other 5 react differently with D T N B compared to rabbitmuscle aldolase. These differences are not surprising since only 2 cysteines are conserved in both amino-acid sequences: Cys-221, which is buried, and Cys-300, which is a fast-reacting one [5,6]. Moreover trypanosomal aldolase is much more sensitive to inactivation by D T N B and a formation of an enzyme-substrate complex does not protect the e n z y m e from inactivation.
Conclusion. When we compare the T. brucei aldolase with its homologues from S. aureus and rabbit muscle it becomes obvious that there exist significant differences between the three enzymes. The bacterial aldolase, with its m o n o m e r i c structure [20] was hardly affected by the different forms of chemical modifications we applied. Differences between the m a m m a l i a n and the trypanosomal enz y m e were: (i) structural variations at the C6-phosphate binding region; (ii) the arrangement of cysteines in the protein structure and (iii) a distinct sensitivity towards the inactivation by DTNB.
