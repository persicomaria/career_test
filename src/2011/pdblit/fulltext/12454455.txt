The impact of Glu3Ala and Glu3Asp mutations on the crystallization properties of RhoGDI: the Ê structure of RhoGDI at 1.3 A resolution
It is hypothesized that surface residues with high conformational entropy, speci®cally lysines and glutamates, impede protein crystallization. In a previous study using a model system of Rho-speci®c guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI), it was shown that mutating Lys residues to Ala results in enhanced crystallizability, particularly when clusters of lysines are targeted. It was also shown that one of Ê these mutants formed crystals that yielded diffraction to 2.0 A, a signi®cant improvement on the wild-type protein crystals. In the current paper, an analysis of the impact of surface mutations replacing Glu residues with Ala or Asp on the stability and crystallization properties of RhoGDI is presented. The Glu3Ala (Asp) mutants are generally more likely to produce crystals of the protein than the wild-type and in one case the resulting crystals yielded a diffraction pattern Ê to 1.2 A resolution. This occurs in spite of the fact that mutating surface Glu residues almost invariably affects the protein's stability, as illustrated by the reduced ÁG between folded and unfolded forms measured by isothermal equilibrium denaturation. The present study strongly supports the notion that rational surface mutagenesis can be an effective tool in overcoming problems stemming from the protein's recalcitrance to crystallization and may also yield dramatic improvements in crystal quality.

1. Introduction
Crystallization often remains a limiting step in X-ray diffraction analysis of proteins and may be a serious impediment to high-throughput characterization of the proteome. The typical approach to protein crystallization is to screen a broad spectrum of conditions and often to additionally optimize conditions once microcrystals are identi®ed. Precipitant, pH, protein concentration, ionic strength etc. all serve as variables in the process, but in most cases the protein sample is constant. Another strategy is to assay a selection of homologous proteins from a number of species, an approach pioneered by J. C. Kendrew (Kendrew et al., 1954), when he selected sperm whale myoglobin as the subject of his study. Modi®cation of the protein, typically truncation by limited proteolysis or recombinant methods, is also a common practice, particularly when isolated domains of large multidomain proteins are a target. Chemical modi®cations are rarely used with success, but at least two impressive examples are known: myosin subfragment 1, crystallized following reductive methylation of lysines (Rayment et al., 1993) and G-actin in complex with ADP, covalently modi®ed with the ¯uorescent probe tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMR) on Cys374 (Otterbein et al., 2001). Finally, it is possible to modify the surface properties of any protein by site-directed mutagenesis. The

dramatic impact of even single-site mutants on the crystallizability of a protein was initially demonstrated with thymidylate synthase (McElroy et al., 1992). However, surface mutagenesis has never become a routine method, largely because rational application of this strategy is not straightforward. We hypothesized that mutagenesis to alanine of those surface residues that have high conformational entropy may promote crystallization by generating epitopes which could be incorporated in crystal contacts without entropic penalty. Two types of amino acids constitute suitable targets: Lys and Glu. Both amino acids have high conformational entropy and both are almost exclusively located on the surface of proteins. Thus, even without the knowledge of the tertiary fold of a given protein, it is possible to target its surface by selecting Lys and/or Glu-rich peptides. Admittedly, Lys3Ala and Glu3Ala mutations not only reduce the excess surface entropy; they also remove charges and alter the protein's isoelectric point and solubility properties, all of which may contribute to the change in the protein's behavior in crystallization assays. We chose the globular domain of human Rho-speci®c guanine dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) as the model system. This is a cytosolic protein with high Lys and Glu content ($20% of the total amino acids) which is dif®cult to crystalÊ lize. Its structure was originally solved at 2.5 A resolution with crystals exhibiting high symmetry with three molecules in the asymmetric unit (Keep et al., 1997). Using the Lys3Ala strategy and single as well as multiple mutants, we were able to generate several novel crystal forms, one of which diffracted to Ê 2.0 A resolution (Longenecker, Garrard et al., 2001). Furthermore, we showed that crystal contacts often incorporate the epitopes which carry the mutated sites, thus lending credibility to the notion of a causal link between the types of mutations and successful crystallization. More recently, we crystallized a novel protein, the RGSL domain of PDZRhoGEF, using a mutant containing three changes: K463A, E465A and E466A (Longenecker, Lewis et al., 2001; Garrard et al., 2001). As was the case with the Lys3Ala mutants of RhoGDI, the mutated epitope was found to be directly involved in some of the key crystal contacts. In the present study, we return to the RhoGDI model system and analyze the impact of Glu3Ala and Glu3Asp mutations, single and multiple, on the protein's stability and ability to form crystals (Fig. 1). We show that the use of surface mutations of this type also enhances the chances of obtaining X-ray quality crystals and report the structure of a double mutant E(154,155)A of RhoGDI for which high-resolution Ê data (1.25 A) were obtained. We conclude that rational surface mutagenesis can lead not only to crystals of proteins otherwise recalcitrant to crystallization, but also to marked improvement in the quality of the crystals.

2. Methods
2.1. Production and crystallization of RhoGDI mutants

A view of the RhoGDIÁ66 fragment with glutamates shown in full and colored gold. The two sites which were mutated in the highly diffracting crystal form are shown in pink. The sites are numbered according to the amino-acid sequence of the full-length protein. The ®gure was prepared using RIBBONS (Carson, 1991).

Figure 1

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene). The N-terminally truncated form of the RhoGDI, RhoGDIÁ66N, was used as a template. Single mutagenic primers were designed to introduce single, double and triple mutations of the Glu3Ala and Glu3Asp type. Only those double mutants where mutated residues are distant in the sequence were prepared by twostage mutagenesis of single-mutation-carrying plasmids. All primers were purchased from Life Technologies and used after dissolving in distilled water. DNA manipulations and protein expression were performed in Escherichia coli strain XL2Blue (Stratagene). Mutants of RhoGDIÁ66N were expressed as fusion proteins with 26 kDa glutathione S-transferase (GST) and puri®ed from lysed cells under non-denaturing conditions by GST af®nity chromatography. The expression vector was a Pharmacia pGEX4T1 derivative with an rTEV cleavage site (Shef®eld et al., 1999). Expression of fusion proteins was carried out in 2±4 l of cultures in LB medium containing 2% ethanol and incubated at 310 K until the cells reached log phase (OD600 of 0.4±0.6), when expression was induced by the addition of IPTG (®nal concentration 500 mM). Cultures were grown for a further 16 h at 296 K and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rev minÀ1. Cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 8.5 with 300 mM NaCl and lysed by sonication. Cell debris and insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation at 16 000 rev minÀ1 for 60 min and clear supernatant was applied to 10 ml glutathione-Sepharose columns (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with 100 ml of GST buffer. Proteins were allowed to bind to the column for 1 h at 277 K. Columns

were washed with 2 l of GST buffer. Fusion proteins were recovered from the matrix under mild elution conditions (GST buffer containing 10 mM glutathione). The presence of the GST fusion protein was analyzed by SDS±PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels in a Laemmli buffer system. The GST tag was removed by incubation with rTEV protease (100 units per 50 mg of protein; Life Technologies) at 283 K. The contaminating GST tag was removed by passing the rTEV-treated protein mixture through another glutathione-Sepharose column. The rTEV protease and residual GST were removed by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 column). Proteins were crystallized by the vapor-diffusion method using Crystal Screen I and Crystal Screen II kits from Hampton Research. The sitting drop consisted of 1 ml of protein solution at a concentration of 15±20 mg mlÀ1 and 1 ml of screen solution. The vapor-diffusion trials were carried out using CompactClover 96 well plates (Emerald Biostructures), which were sealed by clear plastic tape. CompactClover plates were chosen to minimize the required volume of the screen solution. Screens were stored in a temperature-controlled environment at 294 K. Optimization was carried out by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 294 K using VDX 24well plates. Each well was ®lled with 500±750 ml of the crystallization solution. In this case, crystals usually appeared within one week.

2.3. Crystallographic analysis of the E154A, E155A mutant 2.3.1. D66 E(154,155)A crystal structure determination. Crystals were harvested in a stabilizing cryosolution (26% PEG 4000, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 200 mM LiSO4 and 20% glycerol) and quickly frozen by plunging them into liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single frozen crystal at the Brookhaven National Laboratory NSLS beamline X9B using an ADSC Quad CCD detector. Highresolution data were collected and merged with data collected on a second pass at shorter exposure times. Re¯ections were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and intensities were converted to structure-factor magnitudes using TRUNCATE (French & Wilson, 1978). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and a previously determined structure of RhoGDIÁ66 (PDB code 1fso) as a search model. Two orientations yielded values (correlation coef®cients of 22.3 Ê and 21.6 for data in the resolution range 15±3.5 A) signi®cantly higher than other solutions for the rotation function. The relative positions of the two molecules were readily found in the translation search; rigid-body ®tting to data in the Ê resolution range 15±3.3 A yielded a correlation coef®cient of

is related to CSII No. 14 in that it contains 2.0 M ammonium sulfate. Crystals from these two conditions are isomorphous and belong to space group R32 with very close axial lengths (Table 2). However, the kinetics of crystal growth varied signi®cantly between the mutants, with the double mutant E(154,155)A yielding the largest single crystals. It is noteworthy that the morphology of some crystals grown from CSII No. 14 is markedly different, suggesting a different symmetry, although their small size precluded experimental space-group assignment. The crystals grown from CSII No. 26 are all likely to be of the same monoclinic C2 form and rather poorly diffracting, although only one mutant (E109A) was evaluated by diffraction. Five mutants gave hits from CSI No. 15 (30% PEG 8000, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate), which is a set of conditions close to those of CSII No. 26. The morphology of these crystals, all of which were of poor quality and small size, is reminiscent of those from CSII No. 26, suggesting that they too are of the C2 type. Thus, all of the mutants (except for E163D) gave crystals of either the C2 or the R32 form or both. The triple mutant E(154,155,157)A gave hits in ten different conditions, including seven unique to this mutant. However, they were relatively small and were not used in diffraction studies. In addition, the double mutant E(154,155)A and the single mutant E87A gave crystals from CSI No. 17 (30% PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris±HCl pH 8.5, 0.2 M lithium sulfate). The E87A crystals were invariably twinned, but the observed diffraction Ê extended to 2.0 A or better. We were unable to obtain any single crystals from this mutant and as a result the space group was not determined. The E(154,155)A mutant gave higher quality crystals after some optimization of crystallization conditions and a single crystal was found which exhibited a novel symmetry with a triclinic unit cell and a diffraction Ê pattern extending to very high resolution (beyond 1.2 A).

3.1. Crystallization screens and diversity of crystal forms

In total, 16 single and multiple mutants were prepared and screened for crystallization (Table 1). Wild-type protein was used as a control and in one isolated case a single crystal grew from solution No. 14 of Crystal Screen II (2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 0.2 M potassium/sodium tartrate). All mutants but one (E163D) gave hits in both crystallization screens, Crystal Screen I (CSI) and Crystal Screen II (CSII). The most common conditions were those from which wild-type protein grew and No. 26 from CSII, i.e. 30% PEG MME 5000, 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate. Two double mutants crystallized from CSI No. 4, which

To evaluate the stabilities of selected Glu3Ala and Glu3Asp mutants we monitored chemical denaturation by ¯uorescence changes. This method leads to a direct determination of the ÁG at room temperature, at which temperature crystallization screens were carried out. Our attempts to use the method of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which yields accurate values of the denaturation temperature Tden, was made dif®cult by the fact that thermal denaturation led to some protein aggregation. Denaturation curves of the GDI wild type and its nine mutants obtained by monitoring the increase in ¯uorescence are shown in Fig. 2. The solid lines represent the non-linear least-squares best ®ts of the data to (1). It can be noticed from Fig. 2 and Table 3 that wild-type Á66 RhoGDI as well as all mutants show relatively low stability compared with other proteins of similar size (Makhatadze & Privalov, 1995). The H2 O ÁGden value is $15.4 kJ molÀ1 [this is consistent with an estimate of Tden based on DSC (data not shown) of 321 K]. The destabilization of most of the mutant proteins is manifested by the decrease in [GnHCl]0.5 values and changes in

denaturation cooperativity, documented by m values (Table 3). The strongest decrease in stability, by 7.24 kJ molÀ1, is observed for the E163A mutant. Interestingly, introduction of another Glu3Ala mutation at an immediately adjacent site provides 10.4 kJ molÀ1 stabilization energy, resulting in the only mutant which is more stable than the wild type. All other mutants were found to be less stable than the wild type, although in some cases only by a small margin.

The E(154,155)A double mutant crystallized in vapordiffusion experiments with an optimal reservoir solution of 24% PEG 4000, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 200 mM LiSO4 and 2.5% MPD. Many crystals grown under these conditions diffracted X-rays to high resolution, but were twinned in a visually undetectable manner. However, one comparatively large but imperfectly shaped crystal (0.5 Â 0.2 Â 0.2 mm) exhibited Ê single-lattice diffraction extending to beyond 1.2 A. HighÊ quality data were collected and processed to 1.3 A resolution (Table 4). The crystal belongs to the triclinic P1 space group and the unit-cell volume suggested a content of two protein Ê molecules with 49% solvent (VM = 2.5 A3 DaÀ1). Molecularreplacement calculations readily revealed the positions for two RhoGDI molecules and the model was re®ned (Table 4). The arrangement of the two molecules in the unit cell is shown in Fig. 3, showing the molecular packing in a layer of the crystalline lattice and highlighting the variation of the atomic B-factor values indicative of thermal motion. Superposition of the two molecules (designated A and B) involves a 180 rotation and a translation and although no restraints were applied for non-crystallographic symmetry during re®nement, the root-mean-square difference in the positions for the C Ê atoms in the two molecules after alignment is only 0.23 A, Ê with a maximum difference of 0.67 A. The interface between the two molecules is well ordered with low B-factor values. Overall, the structure is very similar to previously described crystal structures of the immunoglobulin-like domain of RhoGDI (Longenecker, Garrard et al., 2001; Keep et al., 1997) with structural alignments of C atoms, yielding r.m.s. deviaÊ tions of 0.57 A compared with the crystal structure of Ê RhoGDI at 2.5 A resolution (PDB code 1rho, molecule A) Ê Ê and 0.54 A compared with the mutant 2.0 A structure (PDB code 1fso). Graphing the distances between the C atoms for these aligned structures as a function of residue highlights local differences (Fig. 4), the largest of which are notably located at residues involved in intermolecular contacts or in regions subjected to point mutagenesis. For example, a spike Ê above 1 A deviation is observed for residue 135, a lysine residue that was mutated to alanine in the 1fso structure. Also in comparison with 1fso, a similar deviation is noted for residue 186, which in the triclinic crystal form of the glutamate double mutant participates in a small interface with other molecules related by translational symmetry. Of particular interest is the packing arrangement of the protein molecules in the triclinic crystal form reported here, revealing the importance of the point mutations for the crystal lattice. The Glu3Ala mutations of residues 154 and 155 allow

the side chain of Arg117 to adopt a novel conformation favorable for intermolecular packing (Fig. 5a). The guanidinium group of Arg117 interacts closely with the side chains of Ser124 and Ser148 of a neighboring molecule, forming the central portion of the interface between molecules A and B. Adjacent to this interaction, the N-terminus of molecule A lays against molecule B, forming a hydrogen bond between the Ê main-chain atoms ValA67 NH and CO of GluB157 (3.1 A), with the side chain of Val67 ®tting into a hydrophobic pocket of molecule B (Fig. 5b). Ordered solvent molecules provide additional bridging interactions across this interface. The packing within the lattice is such that the interactions of molecule A with molecule B are repeated for molecule B interacting with a crystallographically related copy of molecule A translated by one unit-cell length. In our previous report describing the effects of Lys3Ala mutations on the crystallization of RhoGDI (Longenecker, Garrard et al., 2001), we noted the propensity of RhoGDI molecules to form dimers within various crystal lattices. Typically, Leu170 from one molecule ®lls the entrance to the hydrophobic pocket of a neighboring molecule in a symmetrical arrangement to form a dimer. Minor variations on this general feature result in different angles between the molecules in the various crystal forms. In striking contrast to this arrangement, the molecules of the E(154,155)A mutant pack together, leaving the hydrophobic pocket open to solvent. In fact, the 170-loop does participate in intermolecular contacts, but in this case residues 169±170 form a small interface with residues 99, 100 and 195 of an adjacent molecule. The hydrophobic pocket, which accommodates the geranylgeranyl moiety of Rho family GTPases in functional interactions in the cell, is ®lled with ordered solvent molecules and presents a novel snapshot of the cavity without ligand. We note that this will perhaps be useful in structural studies designed to probe the speci®city and binding characteristics of various compounds in the hydrophobic cavity.

3.4. Crystallographic analysis of other RhoGDID66 mutants

X-ray diffraction data were also collected to medium Ê resolution ($3 A) on crystals of a single mutant E109A, a double mutant E(154,155)A and a triple mutant E(154,155,157)A (Table 2). The E109A mutant crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2, with a unit-cell volume indicating multiple copies in the asymmetric unit. Molecularreplacement calculations revealed a solution for the positions of four molecules in the asymmetric unit consistent with rotational symmetry exhibited in Patterson self-rotation calculations and translational non-crystallographic symmetry revealed by a peak in a native Patterson map. The four molecules are arranged as two dimers packed side-by-side and the dimers consist of monomers that associate in the typical fashion noted above, whereby Leu170 occupies the entrance to the hydrophobic cavity of the neighboring molecule. Interestingly, for each monomer, residue 109 is located at the interface between the two dimers and so is likely to promote the growth of this crystal form. Analysis of the double and triple mutants revealed that both of these crystals belong to space group R32 and are isomorphous with crystal structures of two single lysine mutants analyzed previously (Longenecker, Garrard et al., 2001) and with the wild-type crystal. Residues 154, 155, and 157 are not located at intermolecular contacts in this R32 crystal form and cannot directly impact on the formation of crystal contacts. However, changes in the dipole moment and solubility of the protein may indirectly promote crystal growth in preference to the wild type.

4. Discussion
4.1. Enhanced crystallizability of Glu3Xaa mutants of RhoGDI
Figure 3

In the present study, glutamate residues were chosen as targets for mutagenesis with the objective of testing the hypothesis that their replacement by residues with lower conformational entropy will yield protein with enhanced crystallization potential. Mutations of two types, Glu3Ala and Glu3Asp, were systematically introduced into the RhoGDIÁ66 variant, identical to the protein used to evaluate the impact of Lys3Ala mutations in our previous study (Longenecker, Garrard et al., 2001). Substituting Glu with Ala results in a reduction of total surface conformational entropy, although at the expense of charge removal and possible destabilization. Mutants of the second type, Glu3Asp, were prepared to test the impact of limited entropy reduction without removing a charge. The selection of single mutants which were designed and prepared was not in¯uenced by the structural context, except for Glu163, a relatively rare example of a partly buried glutamate with important structural function: it reaches across the entrance to the hydrophobic pocket between the two -sheets to form a hydrogen bond with Tyr144. We used Glu163 as an additional negative control, as our assumption is that mutation of partly buried residues should not impact on crystallization.

The two molecules within the asymmetric unit are colored according to the temperature factors. The grey sphere indicates the entrance to the hydrophobic pocket. The ®gure was prepared using BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997).

In earlier studies of Lys3Ala mutants, it was found that multiple mutations are more effective than single ones and lead to the formation of epitopes which are involved in the crystal contacts (Longenecker, Garrard et al., 2001). To test this observation, multiple mutants were prepared in two different ways: one type with mutated residues in close proximity in the primary sequence and a second one with mutated residues distant in the sequence, e.g. mutant E(87,155)A, but within a single epitope. At ®rst glance, the results are most encouraging, because with the exception of the E163D, all mutants gave hits in the two Crystal Screens. A closer examination reveals a more complex picture. Most of the mutants crystallize in one of two forms: a C2 cell with four molecules in the asymmetric unit and an R32 cell with two molecules. The latter unit cell was also observed for the wild-type Á66 construct and has been

reported by us previously for the K113A and K141A mutants. It has now become clear that RhoGDIÁ66 has a strong propensity to form the R32 cell and single mutants only change the growth kinetics, not affecting the type of crystal lattice. Crystals grown from CSI No. 4 show the same symmetry and a total of six mutants yield this type of crystals. The C2 form, observed using PEGs as precipitants, is closely related to the R32 cell and a slight change in crystallization conditions results in a change from one to the other. We noted that the E87D mutant crystallized readily from CSII No. 26, typical conditions for C2, but the crystals were of inadequate quality for diffraction experiments. OptimiFigure 4 Comparison of the distances between the C atoms in selected structures of the RhoGDI, superposed by zation experiments using small least-squares (all C atoms), as a function of the amino-acid sequence (consecutive numbering). The amounts of additives (e.g. 2.5% solid line and diamonds indicate the difference between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the MPD) produced a dramatic transiP1 high-resolution form; the long dashes and squares show the difference between molecule A and the Ê tion to the R32 form, without any 2.0 A resolution structure of the quadruple mutant reported previously (Longenecker, Garrard et al., 2001); short dashes and triangles shows the difference between molecule A and molecule A from the trace of C2 crystals. Of the Ê original 2.5 A resolution structure of Keep et al. (1997). 16 mutants investigated, 11 yielded C2 crystals from the CSI No. 26 conditions or a related solution (CSI No. 15). All tested mutants, with the exception of E163D, which yielded no crystals, produced either C2 or R32 crystals, albeit with different growth kinetics and different crystal quality and size. The most dramatic results were observed for the triple mutant E(154,155,157)A, which crystallized from ten different solutions, although in most cases the morphology was reminiscent of either of the two forms described above. Finally, E87 and E(154,155)A gave crystals from a mixture of PEG 4000 and Li2SO4 (CSI No. 17); those from the double mutant were shown to exhibit the symmetry of space group P1 and were Ê subsequently used to collect the 1.3 A data, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the E87D mutant crystallizes in the same form. The data presented in this study combined with earlier experiences of using Lys3Ala mutants for RhoGDI seem to indicate that while single and even double mutants tend to have a signi®cant impact on the crystallization behavior, they do not necessarily induce crystal forms completely inaccessible to the wild-type protein. However, double and triple mutants are much more likely to produce new crystal forms with completely novel packing arrangements and superior diffracting qualities. We note that double and triple mutants have the potential to form epitopes, which directly mediate crystal contacts, in contrast to single mutants, which affect the crystallization kinetics but do not impact on the nature of the Figure 5 contacts.

of Lys and/or Glu residues in close proximity. If our recent successful crystallization of an RGSL domain by this approach (Longenecker, Lewis et al., 2001; Garrard et al., 2001) were to serve as a representative example, as few as ®ve cluster mutations may have to be screened to produce good-quality crystals in a medium-size protein.
4.2. Enhancement of resolution

Our original aim was to test the hypothesis that surface mutagenesis targeting Lys and Glu residues increases the likelihood of obtaining X-ray quality crystals. However, our results indicate that rational surface mutagenesis may yield an additional advantage: even if the wild-type protein does produce medium-quality crystals, new crystal forms generated in this fashion may have superior qualities and diffract to much higher resolution. The original study of the immunoÊ globulin domain of RhoGDI was conducted at 2.5 A resolution. The wild-type crystal of this domain reported here Ê yielded similar quality data to 2.4 A. However, our recent study identi®ed a triple mutant K(135,138,141)A which crysÊ tallized in space group P32212 and diffracted to 2.0 A in spite of a very high solvent content. In this study, we describe a double mutant E(154,155)A (space group P1) which diffracts Ê Ê to beyond 1.2 A and for which very high quality 1.3 A data were processed. In both cases, the mutations resulted in a protein with marked decrease in stability. This demonstrates that the crystal lattice de®ned by intermolecular contacts is the primary determinant of the quality of protein crystals. While thermophilic proteins are easier to work with for diverse reasons, they probably should not be chosen for crystallographic studies exclusively because of their perceived potential to crystallize better than less stable orthologues.

opposing -sheet (Glu163 O42Á Á ÁTyr144 O). We originally chose the E163A mutant as an additional control because a mutation at this position was not expected to result in any signi®cant change in the crystallization properties. Clearly, breaking the hydrogen bond linking the two -sheets is deleterious to the stability of the fold. Interestingly, introduction of yet another Glu3Ala mutation at an immediately adjacent site (164) provides 10.8 kJ molÀ1 stabilization energy to the double mutant E163A,E164A, resulting in the only mutant that is more stable than the wild type (Table 3). The increase in stability observed for the E163A,E164A double mutant may be related to the elimination of the electrostatic repulsion between neighboring side chains of Glu164 and Glu109, located on the outer surface of the -sheet.
4.4. The high-resolution structure of RhoGDID66 (E154,155A) double mutant

Our study also included the ®rst rigorous assessment of the stability of the RhoGDI molecule and of its mutants. One of the potential side effects of surface mutagenesis is destabilization of the protein fold or the reduction of the free-energy difference ÁG between the folded and unfolded states. Given the apparent consensus that more thermostable proteins are better suited for crystallographic analysis, we were concerned that destabilization caused by surface mutations may adversely affect the quality of crystals and success rate of crystallization. Our study revealed that the immunoglobulin domain of RhoGDI is signi®cantly less stable at room H2 O temperature than other proteins of similar size, with a ÁGden À1 value of $15.4 kJ mol . The unfolded N-terminal fragment has little impact on the stability, as the Tden of the Á23 variant, as estimated by DSC (data not shown) is nearly identical to that of the Á66 variant. While nearly all mutations studied destabilize the RhoGDI molecule, the most adverse effect is observed for the E163A mutation. This is very interesting because Glu163 is the only partly buried glutamate in the structure, extending across the entrance to the far end of the prenyl-binding pocket and forming a strong hydrogen bond with Tyr144 from the

RhoGDI, the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor of Rho GTPases, is a physiologically important down-regulator of RhoA, Rac, Cdc42 and related proteins. It has been a subject of numerous studies, both in its apo-type form as well as in complexes with GTPases. RhoGDI is made up of three distinct regions: a 23-residue long N-terminal sequence with no apparent biological or structural properties; an $40residue-long polypeptide unstructured in solution and folded into two helices in complexes with target GTPases; and an immunoglobulin-like domain which binds to Rho via a surface epitope and which sequesters the prenyl moiety in a cavity formed between the two -sheets. The apo-structure of the immunoglobulin domain was characterized by NMR and X-ray diffraction, although the relatively poor quality of the Ê crystals limited the resolution to 2.5 A, thus precluding the possibility of a detailed assessment of some of the features, such as solvation within the cavity, exact stereochemistry of hydrogen bonding etc. Our present study resulted in the preparation of high-quality crystals of RhoGDIÁ66 and Ê allowed us to re®ne the structure at 1.3 A resolution using anisotropic displacement parameters. The re®ned model yields more accurate insight into some aspects of the structure±function relationships. It was noted previously that upon prenyl binding RhoGDI undergoes expansion as the two -sheets separate to accommodate the bound lipid (Grizot et al., 2001; Hoffman et al., 2000). This was based on a comparison of complexed species with the only available uncomplexed structure (Keep et al., 1997), which might have been potentially in¯uenced by crystal contacts or crystallization conditions. Our present study, as well as previous results with Lys3Ala mutants (Longenecker, Garrard et al., 2001), indicate that RhoGDI has a structurally robust fold which is not affected in any signi®cant way by crystal contacts and that the separation of the -sheets in the apo-protein is constant. The high-resolution crystal structure of the E(154,155)A double mutant allows for the ®rst time a reliable analysis of the solvent structure at the entrance to and within the hydrophobic cavity of RhoGDI. This is possible because the

5. Conclusions
The results presented in this paper provide further support for the proposal that rational surface mutagenesis should be regarded as a useful tool in the preparation of suitable X-ray quality protein crystals. The Glu3Ala mutations appear to have enhanced the probability of RhoGDI forming crystals, although the effects were not as dramatic as those reported by us previously for the Lys3Ala mutants. The Glu3Asp mutations seem to have much less of an impact, although the smaller number of mutants investigated precludes more general conclusions. Several observations are worth special emphasis. Single mutants often dramatically change the kinetics of crystal nucleation and/or growth, even though the crystal form may be the same as for the wild type. Therefore, these mutations may be useful when wild-type crystals are poorly reproducible or small. Multiple mutations occurring in clusters are very likely to generate novel crystal forms and may be routinely used for proteins recalcitrant to crystallization or in cases where the quality of wild-type crystals is inadequate. It is highly probable that the cluster mutations may mediate novel crystal contacts. We note that this conclusion is supported not only by our studies of the RhoGDI mutants, but also by the application of the strategy to the RGSL domain of PDZRhoGEF (Longenecker, Lewis et al., 2001; Garrard et al., 2001). Finally, the high-resolution structure of RhoGDI reported in this paper illustrates that crystal contacts appear to be the principal determinant of the quality of the crystals as measured by the resolution. This is a particularly important observation, because it has often been thought that the nature of the protein, particularly its stability, has a critical impact on the quality of the crystals and therefore the resolution of the diffraction data. This is one of the reasons why proteins from thermophiles are often preferred targets for crystallographers. Our work demonstrates that even destabilizing mutations can generate crystal-forming epitopes, which lead to crystals of superior quality compared with wild-type proteins. This phenomenon has also been recognized recently with respect to membrane proteins (Camara-Artigas et al., 2001). We note that of the nearly 13 500 crystallographic entries in the Protein Data Bank, over 2500 (18.5%) are based on data Ê collected to a resolution of 2.5 A or worse. Many of these entries refer to proteins or complexes of unique biological signi®cance. Given the comparative ease (by use of modern
