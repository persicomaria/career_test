Structure of the p53 Tumor Suppressor Bound to the Ankyrin and SH3 Domains of 53BP2
Svetlana Gorina and Nikola P. Pavletich
Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a P hairpin and two a helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

null mice (9) do not exhibit the tumorprone phenotype of p53-null mice (10), suggesting the existence of additional mediators of p53's tumor suppressing effects. In addition to DNA binding, several protein binding activities have been described for p53 (1). Among these, the binding of the 53BP2 protein, which was identified by its ability to hind the core domain of p53 in a yeast two-hybrid screen (1 1), is disrupted by alanine substitutions at several of the frequently mutated amino acids of p53 (11). To help investigate the significance of the 53BP2-p53 interaction, we have determined the 2.2 A crystal structure of the complex containing the p53 core domain and a 229-residue COOH-terminal domain of 53BP2 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This complex forms with a dissociation constant of -30 nM as determined by surface plasmon resonance measurements (12).
The 53BP2 COOH-terminal domain (residues 291 to 519) contains four ankyrin repeats (13), each about 30 residues long, and a Src-homology-3 (SH3) domain (14)-two distinct structural motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions in diverse regulatory molecules. In the crystal structure of the 53BP2-p53 complex, the ankyrin repeats and the SH3 domain form a single structural domain as they pack extensively against each other (Fig. 2, A and B). The p53 core domain structure in the complex is essentially identical to the crystal structures of free and DNA-bound p53 (15), consisting of a 1 sandwich that serves as a scaffold for two large loops (the L2 and L3 loops) and a loop-sheet-helix motif (H2

The cell cycle arrest is mediated, at least in part, by p53's sequence-specific DNA binding (6) and transactivation functions (7), which can induce the expression of the p21(Cip1WAFI) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, arresting the cell cycle (8).

mW to the film. For smaller or larger spots, the power was decreased or increased approximately in proportion to the diameter of the laser spot focused on the tissue. The absorption coefficient of the EVA film, measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as well as by direct transmission, was 200 cm-' at the laser wavelength (10.6 pm). Because >90% of the laser radiation was absorbed within the thermoplastic film, little direct heating of the tissue specimen by the laser occurred. The glass slide provided a large heat sink that confined the full-thickness transient focal melting of the thermoplastic material to the targeted region. The focally molten plastic wet the targeted tissue. After cooling and recrystallization, the film formed a local surface bond to the targeted tissue that was stronger than the adhesion forces of the tissue to the slide. The film and targeted cells were removed from the tissue specimen, resulting in focal microtransfer of the targeted tissue to the film surface. 15. For PCR, the transfer film and adherent cells were immediately resuspended in 40 p1I of 10 mM tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1% Tween-20, and proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) and incubated overnight at 37°C. The mixture was boiled for 10 min to inactivate the proteinase K. The tubes were briefly spun (1000 rpm, 1 min) to remove the film, and 0.5 [l of the supernatant was used for PCR. For the most efficient tissue recovery, the transfer film was initially applied to the tissue section as a circular disk (diameter 0.5 cm). After LCM transfer, the disk was placed into a well in a 96-well microtiter plate containing 40 R1I of extraction buffer. The oligonucleotide primers for the polymorphic DNA markers were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Loci were D8S136 and D8S339 located on chromosome 8p, Dl 7S855 on chromosome 17q21, D11S449 on chromosome 11q13, D9S171 on chromosome 9p, specific primers for exon 2 of the VHL gene, and specific primers for M. tuberculosis. All PCR reactions used incorporation of [32P]deoxycytidine triphosphate for visualization of product except amplification of M. tuberculosis, which was visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Volumes were proportionally adjusted downward, and a 1 0-fold increase in glycogen carrier (10 ng/ml) was used in all precipitation steps. After initial recovery and resuspension of the RNA pellet, a deoxyribonuclease (DNase) step was performed for 3 hours at 37°C using DNase (10 U/ml; GenHunter, Nashville, TN) in the presence of 4 U of RNase Inhibitor (PerkinElmer), followed by reextraction of the RNA. The resuspended RNA was reverse-transcribed using 5 p.M random hexamer primers (Perkin-Elmer), 250 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 100 U of reverse transcriptase (MMLV, GenHunter). PCR was performed with specific actin or PSA primers, and the products were subjected to denaturing electrophoresis gel analysis. 18. S. Meyers, R. F. Bonner, M. M. Rodrigues, E. J.

This surface holds the key to understanding p53's finction and its inactivation in tumors because it consists of evolutionarily conserved regions of p5 3 [conserved boxes III, IV, and V (15)] to which most of the tLtmori('enic muititation-s imiap (15). 53 BP2 tIses its fouirth ankyrin repeat and its SH3 domain to hind two adjacent, buLt discontinUoUS, portions of thiS Surface (Fig. 2, A and 13). A ( hairpin from the foturth ankyrin repeait contacts the L2 loop of p53 (conserved box III), whereas the peptide bindiing gryroove of the SH3 domain, which makes significantlv more contacts, interacts with the L3 loop of p53 (con-serxved box IV). The site of 53BP2 binding overlaps thle site of DNA binding (Fig. 2, C and D) (15). Thc binding of the 53BP2 SH3 domaiun to the L3 loop of p53 differs from thait observed in canonical SH3 -polyprolmne peptide (PXXP ligand, where P stands for proline) complexes in several ways (16, 17). In the 53BP2-p53 coimiplex two segmnents of the p5 3 L3 loop bhind the groove of the SH3 domain, whereas in SH 3-PXXP comnplexes only a single extenLded peptide binds (Fig. 3A) (16, 17). Fuirthermore, in the 53BP2p53 comiiplex, the positions and orientaitions of the interacting groLIps are determined by the global structure of the p53 core domain, whereas in SH3-PXXP comiplexes the steric and hydrogen bonding completnentarity is provided by the peptide adopting a lefthanded polyproline-Il helix contorm stion (16, 17). The L3 loop of p53 forms a rigid hairpin struictuire that is stabilized by mtiltiple intraM(O)leculcar hydrogen bonds and b 7inc coordinMation (15). The NH,-terminal seyment of the L3 hacirpin (residues 241 to 243) occUpies a position on the SH3 peptidebinding groove similar to the P0 - Pr P residues of a PXXP ligand (Fig. 3A), and it Makes contacts analogouLs to those in canonical SH3-PXXP comiplexes. The Met'4 side chain of pS53 binds the hydrophobic pocket of the SH3 domain (analogous to the PO hydrophobic residuLe of a PXXP ligand), and the backbone carbonyl of Ser241 hyydrogeni bonds to the Trp4(8 side chain of 53BP2 (Fig. 38). The COCH-terminal segeiiicnt of the L3 hairpin (residuies 247 and 248) is juxtaposed to tlhe NH,-terminal segment and also hinds in the SH3 grooxe, bUt it is positioned in a miiainner not seen in other SH3 comilplexes (Fig. 3A).

compared to the SH3 consensus, is also in close proximity to p53 and is likely to play a role in binding, although its partial disorder in the crystal structure makes this difficult to evaluate. Six of the eight amino acids in this loop are carboxylic acids, and they are positioned near Arg2733of p53 (Fig. 2, A and B). The 53BP2 SH3 sequence aligns with the overall SH3 consensus well, except that al peptide-binding groove Tyr residue, conserved in almost all the SH3 domains [Tyr'86 in c-Crk (17)], is replaced by Leu514 in 53BP2 (Fig. 3A). The functional significance of this substitution is that in canonical SH3-PXXP complexes the Tyr side chain makes van der Waals contacts to the hydrrophobic PO residue of the PXXP peptide (16, 17), but in the 53BP2-p53 complex, the Met243 of p53 that binds in this region is buLlkier than the PO residues of canonical PXXP ligands (Pro, Val, Leu), and it would not fit well in the binding site if 53BP2 had a Tyr residue at position 514 (Fig. 3A). The crystal structure revealed that an individUal ankyrin repeat has a novel L-

The f3 ute to inter-repeat stabilization through hairpin is connected to the first helix via a hydrogen bond networks (residues 365 and one-residue linker, with the plane of the 1 398, Fig. 4, A and B), and hydrophobic sheet being perpendicular to the helix axes. residues contribute to intra- and interNeighboring repeats pack via their hairpins repeat packing (Fig. 4B).

failure to bind to DNA (15), which is expected because the 53BP2 and DNA binding surfaces and residues of p53 overlap considerably. This raises the possibility that the disruption of 53BP2 binding by tumorigenic mutations may be secondary to their disruption of DNA binding, and loss of 53BP2 binding may thus have little or no functional consequence for tumorigenesis. We note, however, that among the p53 surface residues with no apparent structurestabilizing roles, those that contact 53BP2 but not DNA (15) are also found mutated, although at lower frequencies [0.3, 0.7, 0.2, and 0.2 percent of the 3393 missense mutations in the database (22) for His'78, Arg181, Met243, and Asn247, respectively]; and, conversely, those residues that contact only the DNA but not 53BP2 also show similarly low mutational frequencies (0.0, 1.1, 0.6, 1.4, and 0.5 percent for Lys120, Ser241 Cys277, Arg280, and Arg283, respectively). In fact, the highest mutational frequencies occur at residues involved in both DNA and 53BP2 binding (8.6 and 8.8 percent for Arg248 and Arg273, respectively). The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo. (i) The 53BP2 SH3 domain contains a rare amino acid substitution (Leu514) at an otherwise strictly conserved residue of the SH3 consensus, and this substitution appears to be critical for p53 binding. (ii) The fourth ankyrin repeat contains an insertion (Tyr424) compared to the ankyrin consensus, and the insertion is critical for the surface complementarity at the ankyrin-p53 interface. (iii) The p53 surface that interacts with 53BP2 is highly conserved across species and is frequently mutated in cancer.

The GST-53BP2 fusion protein [53BP2 residues 291 to 529; numbering according to (13)] was overexpressed in Escherichia coli (11). 53BP2 was cleaved from the fusion protein by factor Xa, and it was purified by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The complex was formed by mixing the 53BP2 preparation with the p53 core domain [residues 94 to 292, (15)], and it was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 20 mg/ml in a buffer of 50 mM bis-tris propane-HCI (BTP), 200 mM NaCI, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 6.8.

teins, including the pl6 (INK4) cyclin-dependent kinase4 inhibitor (18), the GABP transcription factor (19), and the notch receptor (20), and such versatility in binding is consistent with the non-globular tertiary structure of the ankyrin motif revealed in our study. The concave and convex surfaces of the L-shaped structure, coupled to the protruding tips of the i hairpin and of the ot helices may well offer many possibilities for interactions with diverse macromolecular surfaces. To investigate further the correlation between tumorigenic mutations and loss of 53BP2 binding, we tested the six most frequently observed p53 mutants and found that they are all defective in 53BP2 binding in vitro (Fig. 5). Four of these mutations (R175H, G245S, R249S, and R282W) involve residues that play important roles for the structural integrity of the conserved surface of p53 (15), and failure by these mutants to bind to 53BP2 is likely due to structural defects; the remaining two mutations (R248W and R273H) involve surface residues that play a role in 53BP2 binding, and failure by these mutants to bind to 53BP2 is likely due to the loss of intermolecular contacts. We also tested the relatively infrequent V143A mutation, which occurs in the hydrophobic core of the a sandwich of p53 (15) and results in a temperature-sensitive phenotype for tumor suppression (21), and found that this mutation eliminated 53BP2 binding at the nonpermissive temperature but not at the permissive temperature (Fig. 5). Failure by these tumor-derived mutants to bind to 53BP2 closely parallels their

Ul -Mediated Exon Definition Interactions Between AT-AC and GT-AG Introns
Qiang Wu and Adrian R. Krainer*
A minor class of metazoan introns has well-conserved splice sites with 5'-AU-AC-3' boundaries, compared to the 5'-GU-AG-3' boundaries and degenerate splice sites of conventional introns. Splicing of the AT-AC intron 2 of a sodium channel (SCN4A) precursor messenger RNA in vitro did not require inhibition of conventional splicing and required adenosine triphosphate, magnesium, and U12 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). When exon 3 was followed by the 5' splice site from the downstream conventional intron, splicing of intron 2 was greatly stimulated. This effect was Ul snRNA-dependent, unlike the basal AT-AC splicing reaction. Therefore, Ul -mediated exon definition interactions can coordinate the activities of major and minor spliceosomes.

Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing requires the stepwise assembly of the Ul, U2, U4/U6 U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles, and numerous proteins on the substrate to form a spliceosome, which catalyzes two sequential trans-esterification reactions (1). Most introns have 5' and 3' splice sites that match degenerate consensus sequences, of which the 5'-GT and AG-3' intron ends are nearly invariant features. Many point mutations that result in a variety of human genetic diseases affect these dinucleotides and seriously impair gene expression (2). Mutation of G to A at the 5' end or of G to C at the 3' end is especially deleterious, but the double mutation restores splicing (3). Recently, a minor

class of natural pre-mRNA introns with 5'-AT and AC-3' boundaries emerged as an exception to the GU-AG rule (4, 5) (Table 1). The mouse cyclin-dependent kinase CDK5 and the human voltage-gated skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle sodium channel a subunits (SCN4A and SCN5A) also contain AT-AC introns (Table 1) (6). Most AT-AC introns share highly conserved sequences at the 5' splice site, at the presumptive branch site, and a shorter sequence at the 3' splice site (Table 1). They lack the extensive polypyrimidine tract characteristic of most conventional 3' splice sites, and the distance between the presumptive branch site and the 3' splice site junction is unusually short. Intron 21 of human SCN4A and intron 25 of human SCN5A, which interrupt homologous positions of the coding sequence, also begin with AT and end with AC; however, the rest of their 5' splice site and putative

200HB generator. The native-2 data set was collected with a CCD detector at the Al beamline of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS). The structure was determined by a combination of multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and molecular replacement (MR) methods. The position of the p53 core domain was determined by molecular replacement (MR) with the program X-PLOR (26), and the structure of the core domain from the p53-DNA complex (15). The correlation coefficient was 0.45 for 10 A to 4 A data. Heavy atom soaks were performed in well buffer lacking DTT, containing either 0.5 mM HgCI2 or 0.5 mM lead acetate, for 4 and 24 hours, respectively. The MIR analysis with the CCP4 program suite (27) included anomalous scattering from the HgCI2 derivative and had a mean figure of merit of 0.50 for 20.0 A to 3.2 A data. Initial maps were calculated by combining the MIR and the MR p53 phases with the program SIGMAA (27) and showed interpretable density for 53BP2. Successive rounds of model building, simulated annealing refinement with the program X-PLOR and phase combination allowed the complete interpretation of the 53BP2 structure. The model was then further refined by least squares refinement with the program TNT (28). In the crystals, the 53BP2 molecule has an overall temperature factor of 64.0 A2, which is significantly higher than that of the p53 core domain (35.0 A2). Consequently, the overall 53BP2 electron density is of lower quality than that of p53. The final model consists of residues 97 to 287 of

p53, residues 327 to 519 of 53BP2 and 275 water molecules. 53BP2 residues 291 to 326 from the NH2terminus, residues 491 to 495 of the n-src loop of the SH3 domain, and residues 436 to 441 in the linker between the a helices of the fourth ankyrin repeat have poor electron density and are likely to be disordered in the crystals.

sequences does not match the which may indicate that these two introns belong to a distinct subclass of AT-AC introns. There are no obvious structural relations or common expression patterns among the genes or gene families that contain AT-AC introns, and neither the length nor the position of AT-AC introns is conserved among unrelated genes. However, AT-AC introns and their positions within specific genes are conserved phylogenetically. Two members of the gene family of voltage-gated sodium channels, SCN4A and SCN5A, contain AT-AC inis trons at homologous positions, and it likely that these introns will prove to be conserved in other sodium and perhaps calcium channel family members (7). A pre-mRNA consisting of the SCN4A AT-AC intron 2, the two flanking exons, and nine nucleotides (nt) of the conventional intron 3 (Fig. 1) was transcribed in vitro (8). Optimal conditions for splicing of this substrate in HeLa cell nuclear extracts were established (9). The maximal splicing efficiency was 11% (Fig. IA). SCN4A spliced less efficiently and with much slower kinetics than 3-globin. The extent of splicing did not increase beyond 6 hours (10). The fidelity of splicing was verified by sequencing of the gel-purified mRNA after reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification (10, I 1). In addition to the major AT-AC spliced product, a minor product accumulated that corresponds to conventional GT-AG splicing by means of cryptic 5' and 3' splice sites located in exons 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. IB), as verified by sequencing (10, 11). RNA molecules corresponding to free exon 2 and lariat-exon 3 intermediates, and to released intron lariat, also appeared with appropriate kinetics (Fig. IA). As expected, the lariat molecules had anomalously slow mobility on higher percentage gels (10, 12). Recently, accurate in vitro splicing of the human P120 AT-AC intron was reported and could only be detected upon debilitation of Ul or U2 snRNPs with comple2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides mentary (13). Because efficient accessibility of snRNPs requires incubation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (14), this approach precluded a study of the ATP requirement for AT-AC splicing. Because SCN4A ATAC splicing can be detected in untreated extracts (Fig. IA), we examined the requirement for ATP and magnesium and found that both are essential for AT-AC splicing (10). To examine the role of major and minor snRNPs in SCN4A AT-AC splicing in vitro, we used oligonucleotide-directed ribonuclease H (RNase H) cleavage of the snRNAs (14), and the resulting extracts
