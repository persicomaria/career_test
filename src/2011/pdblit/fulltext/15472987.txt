Preparation and Purification of holo- and apo-Fbp: HoloFbp was prepared essentially by the methods previously described.[ 1 , 2 ] Apo-Fbp was obtained by dialysis of holoFbp against 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5 and followed by chromatography on a Mono STM HR5/5 column (Pharmacia

Biotech) eluted with a gradient of 0 ­ 1 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL/min

(AKTAbasic Labcrew, Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions of 1 mL with a gradient of 0.3 to 0.4 M NaCl were collected and exchanged into 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 by centrifugation 4× using a VIVASPIN 20 (MW cut-off 10 kDa, VIVAScience). The concentration of holo-Fbp was determined by UV-vis using 481 = 2 430 M-1cm-1 and 280 = 48 900 M-1cm-1, and the concentration of apo-Fbp was determined according to 280 = 44 200 M-1cm-1.[1]

pH Measurements: Values of pH were determined using a Corning 240 pH meter equipped with a micro combination electrode (Aldrich), calibrated with buffer solutions

(Aldrich) at pH 4, 7, and 10. 2

X-ray crystallography:

The positions of the Zr atoms in

Zr3-Fbp were revealed by the difference Fourier syntheses calculated with the phases from the model refined without clusters. Strong peaks in the Fobs-Fcalc difference map

clearly indicated the triatomic nature of the clusters in all 9 molecules in the asymmetric part of the unit cell. Zr ion positions were confirmed by the peaks in

difference anomalous map which covered the ions and were as high as 3.5 - 8.4 , though the anomalous contribution from Zr at this wavelength is as small as 1.0 . The anomalous signal of about 0.2  for the phosphorus atoms was too weak to allow resolution of the nature of the capping group. The presence of phosphate in the metal cluster was evident from the analytical data and fitted well into the electron density of most of the 9 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The model of the tri-zirconium phosphate inorganic oxo-cluster Zr clusters was built the by analogy with small

Database and refined with CNS. The crystals were twinned and the twinning fraction refined to 0.49. The electron density of all 9 Zr oxo-clusters was clear in the core region and variable ambiguous peripheral parts were

modelled by water molecules.

collected in transmission mode at room temperature for the complexes K2[Zr(NTA)2]·2H2O, [Zr(EDTA)(H2O)2]·2H2O, and K2[Zr2(DHPTA)2]5H2O (where NTA = nitrilotriacetate, EDTA = ethylenediaminetetraacetate, H5DHPTA = 1,3-diamino-2-

propanol-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid).[3-5] Data were processed using EXCALIB and SPLINE (modified for use with EXCURV).[ 6 ] The EXAFS data were converted into k space. The photoelectron wave vector k is related to the incident photon energy E and to the threshold energy Eo by:

where m is the mass of an electron. The EXAFS data were analyzed using the fast curved wave (or Rehr-Albers)

theory[ 7 ] including up to third order multiple scattering contributions in EXCURV98.[ 8 ] This version of the program includes interligand scattering terms in the

calculations.[ 9 ] Phase shifts were calculated using HedinLundquist exchange and correlation potentials[ 10 , 11 ] and tested against the EXAFS and out data for K2[Zr(NTA)2]·2H2O, All data

distances), and for the presence or absence of Zr-Zr backscattering. Both Zr-Fbp data sets were then analysed as follows. ii. Examination approximate clusters protein of the crystallographic symmetry from axis the data showed the bound an

Using

the

multiple

scattering cluster method,[12] the symmetry of the core of the cluster (3 Zr atoms plus the central O) was examined. The PO4/CO3 group was treated as a rigid body 5

and the remaining Zr ligands (including tyrosine) were treated as single atoms. iii. Simulation of the EXAFS using the crystallographic coordinates of Zr-Fbp, retaining the 3-dimensional

coordinates with full (i.e. including inter-ligand in addition to intra-ligand) multiple scattering. Only the two protein residues directly coordinated to the cluster (Tyr195 and Tyr196) were included, truncated to the side-chain atoms only. The tyrosine side-chains and phosphate/carbonate groups were treated as rigid bodies (constrained refinement), using `ideal' bond lengths and geometries.[ internal geometry of

This maintains both the residue and the over-

the

determinancy of the refinement. The cluster was not constrained. Zr-O bond lengths for the backscattering Zr atoms were set to the average value for the central atom. Similar ligand distances ( < 0.1 Å) were

grouped, based on the first shell analysis, giving 3 ligand distances. Debye-Waller factors were grouped together increasing for similar distances from and the atom type, atom.

Because of their overall minor contribution to the data and the averaging due to varying cluster size and only considering 1 (out of 3) Zr atoms as the central atom, restrained refinement of the tyrosine ligands was not justified. Uncertainties were estimated by calculation of the

covariance matrix.

The resolution is too low for definite assignments to be made to peaks, but it seems likely that peak I is due to Fbp with a bound Zr cluster and peak II is largely due to apo-Fbp. At higher Zr:apo-Fbp ratios higher Zr loading is evident. The eluant was monitored by A280 (lefthand scale), and for selected fractions by ICP-AES analysis for Zr and P

(righthand scale).
