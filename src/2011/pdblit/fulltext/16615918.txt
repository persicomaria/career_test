CD43/leukosialin/sialophorin is the major adhesion molecule in most hematopoietic cells and belongs to the sialomucin superfamily. In leukocyte emigration and activation, the exclusion of CD43 from the immunological synapse is an essential step. While the exclusion requires binding of the cytoplasmic region to ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins, the detailed specific nature of the interaction between CD43 and ERM proteins is obscure. We have characterized the conformational properties of the CD43 cytoplasmic region, consisting of 124 amino acid residues, by hydrodynamic and spectroscopic measurements. Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity studies of ultracentrifugation revealed that the CD43 cytoplasmic peptide exists in a monomeric and extended form in solution. The crystal structure of the complex between the radixin FERM (4.1 and ERM) domain and the CD43 juxtamembrane region peptide reveals that the nonpolar region of the peptide binds subdomain C of the FERM domain. CD43 lacks the Motif-1 sequence for FERM binding found in the FERM­intercellular adhesion molecule-2 complex but possesses two conserved leucine residues that dock into the hydrophobic pocket of subdomain C without forming a 310-helix. The FERM-binding site on CD43 is overlapped with the functional nuclear localization signal sequence. Our structure suggests that regulation of ERM binding may be coupled with regulated intramembrane proteolysis of CD43 followed by the nuclear transfer of the cytoplasmic peptide.

type superfamily of adhesion molecules and consists of a heavily glycosylated extracellular region, a transmembrane helix, and a small cytoplasmic region. CD43 is one of the largest cell-surface molecules on the surface of T cells and is predicted to extend out the highly charged extracellular glycocalyx from the cell membrane by 45 nm.4,5 Shorter cell-surface molecules such as T-cell receptor, which extends by ca 7­ 8 nm, are buried by CD43. Thus, in order to establish an immunological synapse, CD43 should be excluded from the site of T-cell receptor engagement in conjugates. In fact, CD43 is localized and condensed at the distal pole on the activated T-cell surfaces.6­8 Interestingly, the exclusion of CD43 from the cell­cell contact area requires binding of the CD43 cytoplasmic region to ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins.9­11 Moreover, in leukocyte emigration or activation, the cytoplasmic region of CD43 interacts with the cytoskeleton through ERM proteins.12­15 ERM proteins consist of three functional domains, an N-terminal FERM (4.1 and ERM) domain, an extended coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal actin-

636 of 28 residues that exhibits strong binding to the FERM domain. Mutation and x-ray studies revealed that the juxtamembrane region of ICAM-2 contains the Motif-1 sequence motif, RxxTYxVxxA (where x represents any amino acid), for binding to the FERM domain.26 Recognition of Motif-1 is mediated by subdomain C of the FERM domain. The determinant residues make direct contacts with subdomain C and should be strictly conserved for the interactions. In fact, the determinant residues are well conserved among adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Nevertheless, the sequence motif is less conserved in CD43: Ala and Leu replace Thr and Tyr of Motif-1, respectively, which are unable to form hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the VxxA segment that forms a 310-helix is replaced with a glycine-rich sequence that is unfavorable because Gly is a strong helix breaker. Thus, CD43 may have a FERM-binding mode distinct from that of ICAM-2. Interestingly, CD43 possesses a 124-residue cytoplasmic region, which is significantly longer than the relatively short (28 residues) cytoplasmic tail of ICAM-2 and may be folded into a globular domain that affects the FERM-binding mode. Moreover, the CD43 cytoplasmic region exhibits no homology to Motif-2, MDWxxxxx(L/I)Fxx(L/F), which was identified in the FERM-binding region of NHERFs.27 Thus, detailed knowledge concerning how ERM proteins recognize the CD43 cytoplasmic region remains unknown. Here, we report on structural studies of the CD43 cytoplasmic region. We show that the CD43 cytoplasmic region exists as a random coil in solution and reveal details of the interactions between the juxtamembrane region and subdomain C. Recent studies have shown that CD43 possesses a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence within the cytoplasmic tail and the cleaved cytoplasmic tail is transferred into the nucleus.28,29 We show that the FERM-binding region is overlapped with the NLS sequence and discuss potential interference between regulation of the ERM proteins and nuclear transport of the CD43 cytoplasmic tail.

Results
Physicochemical properties of the CD43 cytoplasmic region Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) employing both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium methods was applied to investigate the assembly state of the sample in solution and the approximate shape of the molecule/assembly. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was conducted at three different protein concentrations and analyzed at 30,000 and 39,000 rpm. All these analyses resulted in an excellent fit of the observed absorbance data to the calculated curve based on an ideal single-species model (Fig. 1a). The apparent molecular mass of 12.2 kDa was obtained for the CD43 cytoplasmic peptide, which is close to the theoretical value (13.089 kDa), and suggests a monomer.

Sedimentation velocity measurements were also performed at a CD43 cytoplasmic peptide concentration of 1.4 mg/ml (180 M). The experiments showed the presence of a single boundary, and data analysis yielded a single peak, which suggests monodispersity of the sample containing the molecular species with a sedimentation coefficient of 0.99 S (Fig. 1b). The estimated molecular mass was 16.9 kDa, which is similar to the theoretical value and that of the sedimentation equilibrium experiments (Fig. 1c). Thus, it was demonstrated that the CD43 cytoplasmic peptide exists in a monomeric form and adopts an extremely elongated shape as estimated from the obtained translational frictional ratio (f/f0) of 2.03, which suggests a major/minor axial ratio (a/b) of 20.0. These results are consistent with the results of conventional gel filtration that suggested a molecular mass size of 32 kDa, which is ca 2.5-fold larger than the theoretical molecular mass (13 kDa) (data not shown). Conventional gel filtration properties of proteins are affected by the molecular shape and surface properties of the sample molecule. Further insight into the secondary structure was gleaned by NMR measurements. The 1H­15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the 15N-labeled CD43 cytoplasmic peptide displayed characteristics of a random coil conformation with most of the amide signals within the limited region around 8 ppm (Fig. 1d). Titration of unlabeled FERM domain induced significant changes in the chemical shifts of some peaks, although most of the peaks remained unchanged. Twenty percent of the peaks were shifted or disappeared during titration. The chemical shift changes are associated with binding to the FERM domain, and the overall structure of the CD43 peptide remains as a random coil. This result was confirmed by measuring the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the CD43 cytoplasmic region. The spectrum obtained clearly suggested the absence of typical secondary structures such as the -helix and -sheet at a sample concentration of 9.7 M (Supplementary Fig. 1a in Supplementary Data). In conclusion, the CD43 cytoplasmic peptide exists in a monomeric form and adopts an elongated shape with no apparent secondary structure. When bound to the radixin FERM domain, the overall structure remains as a random coil. Thus, the CD43 cytoplasmic region exists as a tail rather than what would conventionally be described as a domain. Crystallographic experiments Our NMR data clearly support the notion that the FERM-binding region of CD43 could be narrowed down to a limited number of residues. A quantitative binding assay using surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that the radixin FERM domain binds the CD43 peptide consisting of a 31-residue juxtamembrane region.26 This result is consistent with the previously reported pull-down assays and in vivo experiments showing that this truncated cytoplasmic tail is enough for co-concentration with ERM proteins at microvilli in mouse L fibroblasts.14 Consequently,

The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement using radixin FERM domain bound to ICAM-2.26 The model of the FERM­CD43 complex was refined to a free R value of 25.4% for intensity data at 2.9 Å resolution (Table 1). The peptide model contains 15 residues (4­18) out of 20. This FERM-bound peptide region found in our complex crystal is basically

we used short synthetic peptides encompassing the proposed binding region. Following attempts using CD43 peptides of different lengths, we obtained complex crystals between the radixin FERM domain (residues 1­310) and the 20-residue CD43 peptide RQRQKRRTGALTLSGGGKRN (residues 272­291). Crystallization trials using the full-length CD43 cytoplasmic tail were all unsuccessful, probably due to the flexible nature of the protein in solution as discussed above.

Like ICAM-2, the CD43 juxtamembrane region displays three characteristic regions, the N-terminal basic region, the middle nonpolar region, and the C-terminal basic region. The proposed functional NLS for CD43 is shown on the top of the alignment. Part of the nonpolar region of CD43 forms a short -strand (residues 8­11) in our FERM­CD43 complex. Of the 20 residues of the CD43 peptide, 15 residues (4­18) were defined in the current electron density map. The solid lines indicate residues of the peptides defined in the map, and the dotted lines indicate residues that were not defined in the map. The secondary structure of the mouse ICAM-2 cytoplasmic tail is shown at the bottom of the alignment. Key residues for Motif-1 binding in the FERM­ICAM-2 complex are highlighted in yellow. Most of these residues are not conserved in CD43. The residue numbering in CD43 follows that of ICAM-2. (b) Overall structure of the radixin FERM domain bound to the CD43 peptide.

CD43 Recognition by ERM Proteins

Peptide structure and recognition The juxtamembrane region of the CD43 cytoplasmic tail contains three characteristic regions, the Nterminal basic, nonpolar, and C-terminal basic regions (Fig. 2a). This characteristic feature of the tail is similar to that of ICAM-2.26 The peptide lengths of the nonpolar and the C-terminal regions are shorter in CD43, which possesses a six-residue nonpolar region comprising T7­L12 and a five-residue C-terminal basic region (residues 14­18). The CD43 peptide binds subdomain C by fitting into the hydrophobic groove formed by helix 1C and strand 5C in subdomain C (Figs. 2b and 3a). Eight residues of the CD43 peptide encompassing the nonpolar region directly contact subdomain C. The CD43 side chains of Arg6 and Thr7 participate in forming hydrogen bonds with subdomain C (Fig. 3b). In our binding assay using streptavidin-conjugated resin coupled with biotinylated CD43 peptides, an alanine mutation of Arg6 resulted in a significant reduction of the binding affinity (Fig. 3c). This hydrogen bond between Arg6 and Asp252 is accompanied with strong electrostatic interactions by forming a salt bridge and, thus, greatly contributes to stabilization of the peptide binding. The observation is coincident with the previously reported mutation results.15 Contrary to this remarkable effect of Arg6 mutation, an alanine mutation of Thr7 had little effect on the binding affinity. Probably, this solvent-exposed small residue is not essential to the binding specificity. The binding site of CD43 in the radixin FERM domain overlaps with that of ICAM-2 (Fig. 3d), though some key residues for binding are not conserved in CD43 (Fig. 2a). Like ICAM-2, the CD43 peptide forms an additional -strand next to strand 5C from subdomain C. The antiparallel ­ association is mediated by six main chain­main chain hydrogen bonds, four hydrogen bonds between two -strands and two additional hydrogen bonds between the loop and strand 5C. Compared with the FERM­ ICAM-2 complex, CD43 lacks two main chain­main chain hydrogen bonds, one at the N-terminal and the other at the C-terminal flanking regions of the strand (Supplementary Fig. 1c in Supplementary Data). These deviations are due to relatively small conformational changes in the loop regions. Two leucines, the representative CD43 nonpolar residues Leu10 and Leu12, dock into a large hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile245, Ile248, Leu281, His288, and Met285 (Fig. 3a). Mutation of these two leucines displayed significant reduction of the binding affinity, suggesting that these leucines are specificity-determinant residues of CD43 peptide binding (Fig. 3c). In the FERM­ICAM-2 complex, this pocket was occupied with Tyr10 and Val12, and these two residues overlap with the two leucines of CD43 (Fig. 3d). Interestingly, the side chains of two CD43 leucines are tightly packed together with closest van der Waals contacts, whereas the contact between ICAM-2 Tyr10 and Val12 are rather loose because of the smaller side chain of valine. The Leu­Leu interaction could contribute to stabilization of the peptide

consistent with the fraction of shifted or disappeared peptide amide peaks in our HSQC spectra. Side chains of two N-terminal and C-terminal residues were not defined in the current map (Supplementary Fig. 1b in Supplementary Data). Overall structure Similar to the previously reported structures in the free, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate-bound, ICAM-2bound and NHERF-bound forms,26,27,30 the radixin FERM domain in the CD43-bound form consists of three subdomains: A, B, and C (Fig. 2b). The CD43 peptide forms a short -strand and binds subdomain C, which is folded into a seven-stranded -sandwich similar to the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain.30 The overall structure of the radixin FERM domain in our complex resembles that of the ICAM2-bound form rather than other forms: the CD43- and ICAM-2-bound forms gave a small overall rootmean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.64 Å. At present, we believe that these differences may be due to crystal packing. Structural similarity among the subdomains was slightly higher. In particular, the structure of subdomain C bound to CD43 was very similar to that of the ICAM-2-bound form (with an r. m.s.d. of 0.38 Å), which suggests that small inducedfit structural changes in subdomain C occur with CD43 binding as previously observed with ICAM-2 binding.26

(b) Side chain­side chain interactions between the CD43 peptide and residues forming the hydrophobic groove of subdomain C. (c) Interactions between FERM domains and CD43 peptides. Pull-down assay of the radixin FERM domain with biotinylated 31-residue peptides of the wild-type (WT) and mutated mouse CD43 was performed. The mutated peptides contain each alanine mutation of Arg6 (R6A), Thr7 (T7A), Leu10 (L10A), and Leu12 (L12A). The sequence of the wild-type peptide is shown in Fig. 2a.

conformation that fits to the groove of subdomain C. CD43 lacks a hydrogen bond corresponding to that between Tyr10 and His288 in the FERM­ICAM-2 complex.26 Consequently, Leu10 failed to directly contact His288 in the FERM­CD43 complex (Fig. 3b). ICAM-2 forms a 310-helix (residues 12­15, VLAA), and Ala15 is a key residue for docking of this short helix into the hydrophobic pocket.26 Contrary to this, CD43 possesses a glycine-rich stretch corresponding to the helix-forming region of ICAM-2 and forms a loop towards the solvent region given the absence of a 310-helix. The loop coils but lacks interchain hydrogen bonds that are formed in a regular 310- or -helix.

Thus, the loop seems to be flexible. Compared with the ICAM-2 310-helix, the CD43 loop is shifted towards strand 5C probably by forming hydrogen bonds between Ser13 and the main chains of the proceeding loop (Trp242, Ser243, and Ile245) of strand 5C (Fig. 3d). Thus, the hydrophobic pocket in the FERM­CD43 complex leaves an unoccupied space (Fig. 3a), which was filled with the ICAM-2 310helix in the FERM­ICAM-2 complex. The differences are correlated with the difference in binding affinity: the CD43 peptide exhibits a weaker binding to the FERM domain compared with that of ICAM-2 (104 and 16.4 nM, respectively).26

CD43 Recognition by ERM Proteins

Discussion
Biological significance of ERM­CD43 binding in intracellular signaling by regulated intramembrane proteolysis ERM proteins are engaged in the signaling pathway of small GTPase Rho and comprise a positive feedback loop through interactions between the FERM domain and Rho-GDI.31 In vivo experiments showed that Rho-GDI is excluded from the immunological synapse interface and is localized with CD43 at the opposite site of the immunological synapse,9,32 suggesting that ERM proteins, Rho-GDI, and CD43 send intracellular signals by complex formation through the FERM domain. On the other hand, a distinct mechanism that involves signal transduction driven by the release of adhesion molecules from the plasma membrane has also been presented. The processing pathway has been described, which entails proteolytic cleavage in the membrane as well as release and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain, ultimately resulting in changes in gene transcription. CD43 is thought to be subjected to this novel signaling pathway that is called regulated intramembrane proteolysis.33­36 Using a functional NLS sequence at the juxtamembrane region, the cleaved CD43 cytoplasmic tail was shown to be transferred into the nucleus and to subsequently interact with -catenin.28,29 This NLS follows the rules for a bipartite signal and consists of two clusters of positively charged amino acids separated by 10 amino acids (KRR-10X-KR). Importantly, the NLS sequence of CD43 overlaps the ERMbinding motif (Fig. 2a). For efficient nuclear transfer, the cleaved cytoplasmic tail should be released from ERM proteins by inactivation of ERM proteins. Alternatively, by structurally blocking access of processing protease(s) to the CD43 cleavage site, ERM proteins bound to the juxtamembrane region may repress the segmentation of the cytoplasmic tail. The cleavage site by secretases is usually located at an intramembranous region that is close to the intracellular membrane surface.37 In either case, it is an interesting viewpoint of CD43 regulation that activation of CD43 processing proteases may be coupled with regulation of ERM proteins. Recently, ERM proteins have been shown to bear a functional NLS sequence at the central coiled-coil region and are able to localize the nucleus in a cell-density-dependent manner.38 It is tempting to speculate that nuclear cotransport of the cleaved CD43 cytoplasmic tail and ERM proteins may occur in some subconfluent growing cells. Biological significance of the monomeric state of the CD43 cytoplasmic tail Our hydrodynamic studies showed that the tail exists as a monomer with extended random coil conformation in solution. It is remarkable that the obtained major/minor axial ratio (a/b) of 20.0

implies the cytoplasmic peptide extending out from the inner cell membrane towards the cytoplasmic region by  30 nm, which may contribute to efficient recruitment of interacting proteins from cytosol. It is an interesting question whether CD43 may possess an intrinsic ability to form oligomers, which contribute to the localization and condensation at the distal pole on T-cell activation. Our AUC data suggest that condensation of CD43 to the distal pole complex should be mediated by interactions with ERM and other proteins but not by self-association of the cytoplasmic tails. Oligomerization is also important for activation of adhesion molecules and receptors. CD44 binding to hyaluronan is suggested to be activated by dimerization.39­42 PSGL-1, another ERM-binding partner, also forms a dimer that may be related to activation/inactivation.43 Contrary to CD44 and PSGL-1, there is no evidence for CD43 dimerization or oligomerization, which seems to be in favor of our hydrodynamic data showing the monomeric cytoplasmic tail. The FERM-binding motif of adhesion molecules and other membrane proteins The number of target proteins of ERM proteins is growing. In addition to adhesion molecules, recent studies have shown that ERM proteins also bind the membrane-integrated protease NEP (neprilysin).23,44 These ERM protein targets possess a positively charged amino acid cluster located at the juxtamembrane region that is shown to be important for binding in vivo.14 In our structures of the radixin FERM domain bound to ICAM-2 or CD43, the terminal single arginine of the basic cluster participates in the interactions with the conserved Asp252 of subdomain C. The basic clusters are followed by nonpolar regions that represent the predominant part of the binding region, though the CD43 nonpolar region is shorter than that of ICAM-2. Obviously, two hydrophobic residues on alternate positions form part of the determinant for binding to the FERM domain. These residues are tightly packed Leu residues that stabilize the peptide conformation bound to the groove of subdomain C. This side-chain packing could not be formed by a Leu­Val pair because of the smaller side chain of Val. Thus, the double replacement of Tyr and Val of ICAM-2 with two Leu residues in CD43 is important for FERM binding. Unlike ICAM-2 hydrophobic residues following the -strand, CD43 contains a glycine-rich stretch and no hydrophobic residues that could stabilize helical structure and contact with the FERM domain. The pronounced difference in binding affinity between ICAM-2 and CD43 is attributable to the presence or absence of this short helix on binding, in addition to lack of the Tyr­His hydrogen bond found in the FERM­ICAM-2 complex. PSGL-1 binding to the radixin FERM domain is also reduced by disruption of the 310-helix by replacing the key alanine residue with tyrosine.45 Key residues of the radixin FERM domain involved in direct interactions with CD43 are con-

tion equilibrium runs were conducted at three protein concentrations performed at rotor speeds of 30,000 and 39,000 rpm using absorbance optics. The molecular mass was analyzed on the basis of a single species using Beckman software provided as an add-on to Origin Version 4.1 (Microcal Inc.), for which the partial specific volume for CD43 was calculated to be 0.711 ml/g from its amino acid content as determined from its sequence.51 A best fit at 1.4 mg/ml protein is shown in Fig. 1a, which yielded a molecular mass of 12.2 kDa. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at a CD43 cytoplasmic peptide concentration of 1.4 mg/ml and 40,000 rpm for 33 h in a 12-mm Epon double-sector cell at 10 °C. Velocity scans were analyzed with the program Sedfit (version 8.7)52 using 300 scans collected approximately 2 min apart. Size distributions were determined for a confidence level of p = 0.68, a resolution of n = 100, and sedimentation coefficients between 0.1 and 20 s. NMR measurements Uniform labeling of proteins with 15N was achieved using M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole source of nitrogen. Purified samples were dissolved in 20 mM 4morpholineethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA in either 95% H2O/5% 2H2O or 99.8% 2H2O. The final concentration of the protein was 250 M. NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe and a Bruker DRX800 NMR spectrometer. 1H­15N HSQC spectra of the labeled CD43 cytoplasmic peptide were monitored following addition of the unlabeled radixin FERM domain with molar ratio of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0. Measurement of CD For CD spectroscopy, protein samples were prepared with 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). Reducing buffer conditions were obtained by supplementing samples with 1 mM 2mercaptoethanol and 50 mM KCl. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a J-720W spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.) equipped with a quartz cell with 0.1 cm path length. The spectra shown represent the averages of four measurements. Data were evaluated using Jasco (Jasco Inc.) software. Crystallization and data collection Crystallization of the complex between the radixin FERM domain and the CD43 peptide was performed as previously described.53 Purified radixin FERM domain (1 mM) was mixed with the 20-residue CD43 peptide, 272-RQRQKRRTGALTLSGGGKRN-291 (5 mM), at a 1:1 volume ratio (mol ratio, protein:peptide = 1:5). The final protein concentration was 24.6 mg/ml. Crystals of the complex were obtained from a solution containing 100 mM citrate­Na (pH 5.6), 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, and 10% (v/v) isopropanol at 4 °C. All diffraction data were collected from crystals flash-frozen to 100 K following cryoprotection in a solution containing 11% PEG 4000, 18% (v/v) isopropanol, 15% PEG 200, and 100 mM citrate­Na buffer. Crystals of the FERM­CD43 complex belonged to space group P4322 as determined by the following structure analysis. Intensity data sets of the FERM­CD43 complex were collected using a DIP2040b image-plate detector at beamline BL44XU of the SPring-8 synchrotron facility, Harima, Japan. The wavelength was set to 0.9 Å with a crystal-to-detector distance of

served in all ERM protein members, indicating that CD43 binding to other ERM members would essentially be the same as that reflected in the radixin FERM domain. The closely related linker protein merlin, the gene product of neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor, possesses the FERM domain whose structure is essentially the same as those of ERM proteins.46 Merlin preserves most of the key residues, except for Asn251, which is replaced with serine. Since Asn251 can be replaced with a serine residue for hydrogen bonding, CD43 binding to merlin is expected to resemble that to radixin. Residues in the tail FERM domain or the canonical PTB domain,47 however, are poorly conserved. Our results support the notion that the peptide recognition mechanism of ERM subdomain C differs from that of the canonical PTB domain48 and the talin FERM subdomain C,49 which recognize the NPxY (where Y is usually phosphorylated) motif.

Materials and Methods
Protein preparation The FERM domain (residues 1­310) of mouse radixin was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in Escherichia coli and purified by previously described methods.50 Purification of the rat CD43 cytoplasmic region (124 residues, 255­378) was performed as previously described.14 Expression of the GST-fused CD43 cytoplasmic region was induced by incubating bacteria with 1 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside for 2­5 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the resultant cell pellet was solubilized in buffer A [20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM KCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1.5% Sarkosyl, 1 mM PMSF, and 20 mg/ml leupeptin] at 4 °C. Following sonication, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (35,000 rpm, 30 min, at 4 °C). The supernatant was applied to a GST affinity column comprising glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, USA) that had been washed with buffer B [20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT] and then eluted with buffer B containing 50 mM glutathione. The eluted protein was purified by passage through HiTrap Q (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences), and the GST tag was cleaved following digestion with 5 U/ml human thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 h at 10 °C. The cleaved proteins were collected and further purified by passage through HiTrap SP and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The purified protein was concentrated to 13 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra-15 (Amicon, Beverly, MA, USA). Purified protein was confirmed using MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy; PerSeptive Inc.) and amino-terminal analysis (M492; Applied Biosystems). Analytical ultracentrifugation AUC was performed on an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) equipped with an An-60ti rotor. The recombinant protein of the CD43 cytoplasmic region was analyzed with protein concentrations adjusted to 0.5­1.5 mg/ml in buffer D [20 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, and 100 mM KCl]. Sedimenta-

600 mm. Data were collected with angular ranges of 180° with step sizes of 3° and an exposure time of 30 s. The crystallographic data and intensity data processing statistics are summarized in Table 1. All intensity data were processed using the HKL2000 program suite.54 Structure determination and refinement The crystal structure of the FERM­CD43 complex was determined by molecular replacement using the program Molrep in the CCP4 program suite.55 The radixin FERM domain from the FERM­ICAM-2 complex [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 1J19], by excluding the ICAM-2 peptide, is used as a search model. Structural refinement was performed with CNS56,57 using a rigid-body, simulated annealing and individual B-factor refinement. The resultant initial map showed clear electron densities for most of the FERM domain and the peptide. An initial model of the peptide was built into the electron density map using the graphics program O56 in addition to rebuilding part of the FERM domain. In the CD43 peptide model, the side chains of Lys4, Arg5, Lys17, and Arg18 were poorly defined and, in the current structure, were replaced with alanines. No model was built for four Nterminal residues and one C-terminal residue, which were poorly defined in the current map. The side chain of Ser13 was poorly defined in the map, probably disordered. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. As defined in PROCHECK,58 there were no residues in disallowed main-chain torsion angle regions. Figures were generated using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org). A schematic diagram of the interactions was prepared with the program LIGPLOT. Binding experiment Pull-down assays to detect peptide­protein interactions were performed using streptavidin-conjugated bead coupled with biotinylated CD43 peptides. The sample solution (50 l) containing the radixin FERM domain (100 M) in a buffer solution [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 70 mM KCl, and 1 mM DTT] was added to bead suspension. The beads were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and washed two times with the same buffer solution by centrifugation. The amount of biotinylated CD43 peptide bound to beads was monitored by SDSPAGE. An appropriate amount of bead slurry was again subjected to SDS-PAGE to contain the same amount of biotinylated CD43 peptide. Proteins were stained by Coomassie Blue. PDB accession numbers The atomic coordinates and structure factor were deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics PDB with accession code 2EMS.
