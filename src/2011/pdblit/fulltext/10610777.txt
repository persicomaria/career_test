Enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase catalyses the last reductive step of fatty acid biosynthesis, reducing an enoyl acyl carrier protein to an acylacyl carrier protein with NAD(P)H as the cofactor. The crystal structure of enoyl reductase (ENR) from Escherichia coli has been determined to Ê 2.1 A resolution using a combination of molecular replacement and isoÊ Ê morphous replacement and re®ned using data from 10 A to 2.1 A to an R-factor of 0.16. The ®nal model consists of the four subunits of the tetramer, wherein each subunit is composed of 247 of the expected 262 residues, and a NAD cofactor for each subunit of the tetramer contained in the asymmetric unit plus a total of 327 solvent molecules. There are ten disordered residues per subunit which form a loop near the nucleotide binding site which may become ordered upon substrate binding. Each monomer is composed of a seven-stranded parallel b-sheet ¯anked on each side by three a-helices with a further helix lying at the C terminus of the b-sheet. This fold is highly reminiscent of the Rossmann fold, found in many NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes. Analysis of the sequence and structure of ENR and comparisons with the family of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases, identify a conserved tyrosine and lysine residue as important for catalytic activity. Modelling studies suggest that a region of the protein surface that contains a number of strongly conserved hydrophobic residues and lies adjacent to the nicotinamide ring, forms the binding site for the fatty acid substrate.

Introduction
The widespread use of antibiotics has provided a powerful selective pressure driving the development of multi-drug resistance in many species of bacteria with consequent problems in the treatment of bacterial infections. With the increasing availability of structural information on proteins, recent attention has focussed on the use of such data in

strategies for the design of new pharmaceuticals. One of the most important features of any drug is its ability to discriminate between the target enzyme and its counterpart in the host. To this end signi®cant differences in enzymes which carry out the same reaction afford particularly attractive opportunities for drug development and one area of metabolism where this has proved to be the case is in fatty acid biosynthesis. Lipids are synthesised by the multi-functional enzyme complex fatty acid synthetase (FAS) through the extension of the acetyl group attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) by two carbon units derived from malonylCoA in a stepwise reaction (McCarthy & Hardie, 1984). There are two types of FAS complex, type I, found in eukaryotes and yeast, in which all the catalytic domains reside on one or two polypeptides, and type II, found in plants and most prokaryotes, in which the enzymes that catalyse the individual steps are found on separate polypeptides

1530 (McCarthy & Hardie, 1984).The components of the pathway have been well characterised. In bacteria and plants they are malonyl CoA:ACP transacylase, b-ketoacyl ACP synthetases I, II and III, b-ketoacyl ACP reductase, b-OH acyl ACP dehydratase and enoyl ACP reductase. Enoyl reductase (ENR) catalyses the ®nal reaction of FAS, the reversible reduction of a carboncarbon double bond in the enoyl moiety of its substrate which is S-linked to the phosphopantetheine group of an acyl carrier protein: RÀCHCHÀCOÀACP  NADH  H 2 3RÀCH2ÀCH2ÀCOÀACP  NAD X Whilst previously thought to be an NAD-linked enzyme, recent studies have suggested that ENR from Escherichia coli accepts both NADH and NADPH as cofactors (Bergler et al., 1996). Biochemical studies have shown that the reduction catalysed by E. coli ENR occurs by a syn addition of hydrogen via a 2-Re, 3-Si attack on the double bond (Saito et al., 1981). ENR is the target for a number of anti-bacterial agents against E. coli (Bergler et al., 1994) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Banerjee et al., 1994). M. tuberculosis ENR is the target for a metabolite of isoniazid, which is used in the front-line treatment of tuberculosis. However, strains of M. tuberculosis are emerging that are resistant to one or more of the main antituberculosis drugs including isoniazid with consequent severe problems in treatment. E. coli ENR is inhibited by a range of diazaborines, a family of antibacterial agents whose action is thought to lead to the inhibition of cell growth by preventing lipopolysaccharide synthesis (Hogenauer & Woisetschlager, 1981). Biochemical studies on the E. coli enzyme have shown that NAD is required for diazaborine binding and this has led to the suggestion that diazaborine binds to ENR in association with NAD (Bergler et al., 1994; Kater et al., 1994). Crystallographic analysis of this enzyme with NAD and members of the diazaborine family have shown that the mechanism of inhibition by these drugs is through the formation of a covalent bond between a boron atom in the diazaborine and the 2H OH of the nicotinamide ribose moiety (Baldock et el., 1996a). Here, we report the structure determination and analysis of E. coli ENR complexed with NAD Ê to 2.1 A resolution, a description of the overall fold, the nucleotide binding site and a comparison with the family of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases.

crystals are monoclinic, belonging to spacegroup P21 with a tetramer in the asymmetric unit. N-terminal sequencing on the puri®ed protein established that the extent of cleavage of the N-terminal methionine residue from the protein is variable depending on growth conditions. Hence the residues are numbered including this methionine as residue 1. Structure solution The structure was solved by a combination of isomorphous replacement and molecular replacement using the Brassica napus ENR structure (Rafferty et al., 1995) as a search model (Table 1). The initial map was improved by fourfold averaging and solvent ¯attening and a model was constructed using the graphics program FRODO (Jones, 1978). Initially one monomer was focussed upon and the tetramer generated using non-crystallographic symmetry. In later stages of re®nement all four monomers were built independently. This structure was submitted to least-squares Ê re®nement at 2.1 A using the program TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987) and iterative cycles of model building and re®nement were performed. In the ®nal map of the ENR-NAD complex, the electron density is of high quality for most of the protein atoms. However, there is a break in the density for a stretch of ten amino acid residues from Leu195 to Met206 in each of the four subunits of the tetramer, which links strand b6 and helix a6, and borders the nucleotide binding site. In addition, there is no interpretable density for the ®rst residue and last four residues, and thus, the ®nal model comprises co-ordinates for the nucleotide and for 247 of the expected 262 residues per subunit of the protein. A total of 327 solvent molecules have been included in the current model. All side-chains were ®tted but the average side-chain temperature factors for the side-chains of residues Lys17, Asn41, Asp42, Lys43, Arg47, Glu50, Gln54, Glu67, Asp101 and His209 which lie on the enzyme surface, the sidechains of residues Thr194 and Leu195, at the start of the disordered loop, and Glu258, at the C termiÊ nus, are above 75 A2 in subunit A. The electron density for the NAD is unambiguous for the adenine ring, its associated ribose and the pyrophosphate moiety, while the density for the nicotinamide moiety and its associated ribose ring is noticeably weaker. The crystallographic R-factor is 0.16 for all data (52,346 re¯ections) in the 10± Ê 2.1 A resolution range. The model has tight stereochemistry with values for the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) from standard values of the bond Ê lengths and angles of 0.01 A and 1.50 , respectively (Table 2). A Ramachandran plot of the model shows no non-glycine residues within disallowed regions (Figure 1) and examination of Chi1-Chi2 plots for all residue types showed no side-chains in disallowed conformations. The average B-value for Ê Ê protein atoms is 33 A2 (27 A2 for main-chain Ê 2 for side-chain atoms). atoms, 38 A

X-ray Structure of E. coli Enoyl Reductase

Overall fold The ENR subunit comprises a single domain of Ê Ê Ê dimensions 45 A Â 45 A Â 50 A and is formed from seven b-strands (b1± b7), creating a parallel b-sheet, and seven ¯anking a-helices (a1 ±a7) plus a number of loops (Figure 2). The tertiary structures of the monomers are essentially identical, and 241 out of 247 Ca atoms (excluding three residues either side of the disordered loop) from subunit A can be superimposed onto subunits B, C Ê and D with root-mean-square deviations of 0.17 A, Ê and 0.16 A, respectively. The parallel bÊ 0.22 A sheet is ¯anked on one side by helices a1, a2 and a7 and on the other by helices a3, a4 and a5, with a6 sitting along the ``top edge'' of the b-sheet above the COOH-terminal ends of strands b6 and b7 (Figure 2). This fold is highly reminiscent of the Rossmann fold commonly found in dinucleotide binding enzymes (Rossmann et al., 1974). The cofactor is bound in a similar and extended conformation to that observed in other dehydrogenases at the COOH-terminal end of the b-sheet, with the nicotinamide ring lying deep in a pocket on the enzyme surface. The structure comprises 113 residues in helical conformation (46%) and 81 residues in b-conformation (33%; see Table 3). In total, 86% of all possible main-chain hydrogen bonds are made. The long helix a4 contains a ``kink'' at residue Ser120. This helical distortion is stabilised by the formation

1533 between the turn linking helices a6A and a7A and the COOH-terminal end of helix a5C, including a water-mediated hydrogen bond between the mainchain and side-chain of Asn175A and the sidechain of Arg217C. The interactions around the Q-axis are centred on a bundle of four helices formed by helices a4A and a5A and their respective symmetry equivalents a4B and a5B (Figure 4(b)). Helix a4A forms an extensive hydrophobic interface with its symmetry equivalent a4B (Val105, Val108, Phe113, His116, Tyr122, Val125) which is supplemented by hydrogen-bonding contacts between helix a4A and helix a4B (a direct hydrogen bond between the sidechain of Asp118A and the side-chain NH1 of Arg110B, a water-mediated hydrogen bond linking Lys114 to its symmetry-related partner and another linking Lys114A to Arg110B). Helix a4A also has hydrogen-bonding interactions with helix a5B (a hydrogen bond between the NE2 position of His117A and the side-chain of Ser165B) and with the loop following strand b3B (the NH1, NH2 and the NE positions of Arg110A hydrogen bond to the peptide carbonyl group of Val65B and the sidechain of Asp68B). There are also a number of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds between helix a4A and the loop preceding helix a4B (between the side-chain of Arg132A and the sidechain of Asp103B and the side-chain of Asn106B, the side-chain of Lys129A to the peptide carbonyl group of Asn106B) and between helix a5A and the loop preceding helix a5B (from the side-chain of Asn169A to the side-chain of Tyr104B, the sidechain of Arg171A to the peptide carbonyl groups of Ala149B and Glu150B, the peptide carbonyl group of Tyr172B to the main-chain of Tyr104A). A smaller hydrophobic-packing interface is observed between helices a5A and a5B (Leu161, Ala164, Ala168) with a hydrogen-bonding contact between the side-chain of Asn157A and the peptide carbonyl group of Tyr172B through a network of solvent molecules. Contacts around the R-axis are very few with only two direct hydrogen bonds formed by the main-chains of residues Ile253A and Ala255A in the COOH-terminal loop following strand b7A, to the peptide nitrogen atom and carbonyl group of residue Ala152D, which lies in the loop between strand b5D and helix a5D. There is a small packing interaction involving residues Arg151A to Pro154A and residues Ile253D to Met256D at the C termini. Analysis of the nucleotide binding site Analysis of the ENR/NAD binary complex has shown that the cofactor is bound to the enzyme in an extended conformation at the C-terminal end of the b-sheet. The electron density for the adenine ring and its associated ribose and for the pyrophosphate moiety is of high quality, permitting an unambiguous identi®cation of these portions of the cofactor (Figure 5(a)). For the nicotinamide ring and for its associated ribose ring the electron

DC, respectively. On formation of the tetramer, Ê approximately 3500 A2 of the solvent-accessible surface is buried per monomer. The most extensive interfaces are those around the P and Q axis with a Ê Ê total of approximately 1350 A2 and 1700 A2 of solvent-accessible surface buried per monomer in each interface, respectively. The R-axis has a much smaller interface with a total of approximately Ê 650 A2 of solvent-accessible surface buried per monomer. A diagram of the interactions around the P-axis is provided as Figure 4(a). To the exterior of the tetramer about this axis there is a hydrophobic packing interaction between helices a7A and a7C (Phe231, Leu236), and further to the interior of the tetramer between strands b7A and b7C (Ile240, Val245, Val247) which lie on the edge of the parallel b-sheets, and which run anti-parallel to each other. Direct hydrogen bonds are formed between the side-chain of Glu243A and the main-chain nitrogen atom and the ND1 position of His246C, between the main-chain carbonyl group of Gly239A and the peptide nitrogen atoms of Asp248C and Gly249C. A series of water-mediated hydrogen bond contacts are also made from the peptide nitrogen atom and carbonyl group of Ser241A and the side-chain of Glu243A to the main-chain carbonyl group of His246C, the sidechain of Asp248C, the side-chain of Ser252C and to the main-chain of Gly250C. A water-mediated hydrogen bond links Glu243 to its symmetryrelated partner. Two networks of water-mediated hydrogen bonds link Asp235A to Asp224C and Asn227C, and Leu236A and Gly239A to Asp224C and Ser228C. Additionally, interactions are formed

density is weaker than for the rest of the NAD preventing an independent assignment of the conformation about the glycosidic bond to this ring. Nevertheless, the density is consistent with a syn conformation for the glycosidic bond in agreement with the known stereochemistry of hydride transfer of the E. coli enzyme (Saito et al., 1980) and previous structural studies on B. napus ENR (Rafferty et al., 1995).

The adenine ring binds in a pocket on the enzyme surface formed by the side-chains of Gln40, Asp64, Val65, Ile92, Phe94 and Ile119 and by the main-chain between Ile92 and Gly93. Direct hydrogen bonds are formed between the adenine nitrogen atoms at position N1 with the peptide nitrogen atom of Val65 and at position N6 with the side-chain of Asp64 (Figure 5(b) and Table 4).

Analysis of the electron density for the adenine ribose moiety clearly shows it to be in a C2H -endo conformation. In general within the dehydrogenase family, important interactions between the adenine ribose of the NAD and the enzyme are associated with a local bab unit which includes a glycine-rich loop, with the consensus sequence GXGXXG/A between the ®rst strand and the helix (Wierenga

et al., 1985). Inspection of the ENR structure shows it to contain an equivalent structure comprising strands b1 and b2 and their intervening helix, a1. However, analysis of the bab unit in E. coli ENR reveals that the consensus sequence for the glycine-rich motif cannot be identi®ed.

(GAPDH; PDB entry 1GD1 (Skarzynski et al., 1987)) shows that 22 Ca atoms can be superimÊ posed with an rmsd of 0.87 A (Figure 6(a)) with a good overlap of helix a1 in ENR with the structurally conserved nucleotide-binding helix found in GAPDH and in many dehydrogenases (Hol et al., 1978). Close inspection of these two structures shows that the glycine residue at the ®rst position of the glycine-rich motif in GAPDH (Gly7) overlaps with residue Gly13 in E. coli ENR, a residue that is conserved across all known sequences of this enzyme from other species. The sixth position in the motif is commonly either a glycine or an alanine, and this residue in GAPDH (Gly12) overlaps with Ala21 in E. coli ENR which again is either a glycine or alanine residue in all the available ENR sequences. Thus, compared to many other dehydrogenases, E. coli ENR appears to preserve essential elements corresponding to the beginning and end of the glycine-rich motif but accommodates an additional three residues in the intervening loop. A common mechanism for the recognition of the adenine ribose hydroxyl groups in NAD-linked enzymes involves hydrogen bonding between an acidic residue and both ribose hydroxyl groups (Wierenga et al., 1985). Inspection of the structural overlap between E. coli ENR and GAPDH shows that no such residue is present in the ENR structure. Analysis of the ENR-NAD complex reveals that the enzyme still recognises the 2H OH by hydrogen bonding but by a mechanism which involves an ordered solvent molecule occupying an equivalent position to the carboxyl group of the acidic residue in GAPDH and held by a hydrogen bond to the peptide nitrogen atom of Gln40. The 2H OH also makes a hydrogen bond with the side-chain of Gln40. This mode of hydrogen bonding in E. coli ENR is distinct from that seen in many NADlinked dehydrogenases but is similar to that seen in B. napus ENR where both the adenine ribose hydroxyl groups hydrogen bond to an equivalent ordered solvent molecule which in turn interacts with the peptide nitrogen atom of Trp52, the structurally equivalent residue to Gln40 in E. coli ENR.

The pyrophosphate moiety of the NADH lies close to the COOH-terminal end of the b-sheet where it interacts with the glycine-rich region that forms the loop between strand b1 and helix a1, the nucleotide binding helix. Hydrogen-bonding contacts are made by the pyrophosphate oxygen atoms (O5P/O5Q) with the peptide nitrogen atom of Ile20 and, mediated by a solvent molecule, with the side-chain of Ser91 and the main-chain of Gly13 and Ala21. There are no positively charged side-chains close to the pyrophosphate moiety and thus its stabilisation on the enzyme is via the series of hydrogen bonds and the helix dipole of a1 alone. The nicotinamide ribose appears to be in a C2H endo conformation and interactions made by the ribose hydroxyl groups involve hydrogen bonds to the side-chain amino group of Lys163 from the 2H and 3H hydroxyl groups and from the 2H hydroxyl group to an ordered solvent molecule, which in turn forms hydrogen bonds to main-chain atoms of His90 and Ile92. The nicotinamide ring sits in a pocket bounded by the side-chains of Ile20, Leu144, Tyr146, Ala189, Ile192, Leu195 and the main-chain polypeptide from Ala189 to Ile192. The structure of B. napus ENR with NADH shows that the nucleotide is completely ordered on the enzyme's surface with the A-face of the nicotinamide ring packing against the edge of the phenolic ring of residue Tyr32. However, in the B. napus ENR/NAD complex the nicotinamide ring is completely disordered. Whether this is due to unfavourable interactions of the positively charged nicotinamide ring is currently unclear but in the NAD complex of B. napus ENR, the phenolic ring of Tyr32 occupies part of the nicotinamide ring binding pocket. In contrast, in the E. coli ENR/ NAD complex, whilst the electron density for the nicotinamide ring is weak, there is clear evidence for the ring being at least partially ordered by the enzyme. This is a clear difference between the two structures and may be due to the sequence substitution of Tyr32 in B. napus ENR by isoleucine (Ile20) in the E. coli enzyme, with the latter not

appearing to be in a position to sterically interfere with the binding of the nicotinamide ring. Recent studies have proposed that ENR from E. coli can utilise either NADH or NADPH as cofactors in the enzyme's catalytic cycle (Bergler et al., 1996) whilst B. napus and M. tuberculosis ENR

can only utilise NADH (Slabas et al., 1986; Quemard et al., 1995). To investigate this, crystals of E. coli ENR were grown in the presence of 10 mM NADP at pH 5.0 using 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol PEG 400 as a precipitant and were then soaked for three hours in 50 mM NADPH.

The loop between b6 and a6 is disordered in the E. coli ENR-NAD complex and hence a direct comparison of this part of the structure with the equivalent loop in the B. napus enzyme is precluded. However, residues Leu236 to Phe246 in the latter enzyme have high temperature factors and have been implicated in substrate binding (Rafferty et al., 1995). Therefore, the mobility of this loop in the E. coli enzyme may be related to some aspect of substrate binding. The structure of the E. coli enzyme is also closely related to that of its mycobacterial counterpart (PDB entry 1ENY (Dessen et al., 1995)), and 199 Ca atoms from these two enzymes can be superimÊ posed with an rmsd of 1.06 A (Figure 6d). The structural similarity is most apparent in the region of the active site, where 43 residues whose a carÊ bons lie within 12 A of the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring can be superimposed with an rmsd of Ê 0.55 A. Major differences between the structures include a shift in the position of helix a2 and helix a6, and the insertion of an extra helix between strand b6 and helix a6 in the mycobacterial enzyme.

These crystals are in spacegroup P21 and are very similar to those grown in the presence of NAD, enabling the structure to be re®ned directly with the model of the ENR-NAD complex from which the NAD had been removed. This structure was re®ned using TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987) to an Ê R-factor of 0.20 with data from 10 to 2.1 A resolution. Inspection of the re®ned electron density map calculated using coef®cients 3Fo À 2Fc (ac) showed no interpretable density for the NADPH cofactor. This may be due to a much lower af®nity of the E. coli enzyme for NADPH compared with NADH as the speci®c activity with the latter is some 17-fold higher (Bergler et al., 1996). Alternatively, since the Km of this enzyme for NADPH has not been determined, we cannot exclude the possibility that the crystallisation conditions have discriminated against the crystallisation of a nucleotide complex. However, we note that where we have previously set up trials of either the B. napus or E. coli enzymes with NAD(H) in all cases where crystals have formed the nucleotide has been bound. In the absence of direct structural data for the mode of NADP binding to the E. coli enzyme, we have compared the structures of E. coli ENR and B. napus ENR, in order to try to explain the apparent difference in cofactor speci®city. Bergler et al. (1996) suggested that the positioning of a lysine residue (Lys43) near the adenine ribose group of the cofactor may explain why E. coli ENR accepts NADPH as a cofactor. On analysis of the E. coli ENR structure, it is apparent that this lysine residue is making interactions with another subunit of Ê the tetramer and is remote (9 A from the proposed site of the 2H phosphate group, modelled on the basis of the coordinates of the NAD/enzyme complex). However, changes in the torsion angles might allow the amino group of this lysine residue Ê to be placed approximately 3.5 A away from the expected position of the phosphorus atom. Therefore, the positive charge of the lysine residue may provide a stabilising effect for the NADPH. The equivalent residue in B. napus ENR is an alanine whilst in M. tuberculosis ENR the residue at this position is an arginine. Another possible factor which might contribute to the difference in cofactor speci®city of the E. coli enzyme could be the substitution of a glutamine residue (Gln40) near the 2H OH of the adenine ribose in E. coli ENR by the aromatic tryptophan or phenylalanine residues in B. napus and M. tuberculosis ENRs, respectively (Figure 6b). However, in the absence of direct structural information, we cannot be certain of the nature of the nucleotide binding site for an NADPH/enzyme complex. Comparison of the structures of E. coli, B. napus and M. tuberculosis ENRs Overall, the structures of E. coli ENR and B. napus ENR (PDB entry 1ENO) are very similar, and 208 Ca atoms from each enzyme can be super-

Sequence conservation and enzyme mechanism A structure-based, multiple-sequence alignment of enoyl reductases from E. coli, M. tuberculosis and B. napus (whose three-dimensional structures have been determined) and Anabaena spheroides and Haemophilus in¯uenzae shows that across all ®ve sequences 34 residues are completely conserved while 52 residues are strongly conserved (conserved in E. coli and three other ENRs; Figure 7). Most of these residues lie around the cofactor binding site and subunit interfaces in the structures of the E. coli, M. tuberculosis and B. napus enzymes. A plausible mechanism for the catalytic activity of ENR has been described (Rafferty et al., 1995). This involves the hydride transfer from the C4 position of the NADH to the C-3 position at the double bond in the enoyl substrate (Figure 8). This leads to the formation of an enolate anion intermediate which can then be protonated on the oxygen atom to form an enol. Subsequent tautomerization of the enol would then lead to the production of the reduced acyl product. Residues implicated in this mechanism include Lys163, whose role is thought to be to stabilise the negative charge of the transition state, and Tyr156, thought to be the proton donor to the enolate anion. Both of these residues are conserved in the sequences of E. coli, M. tuberculosis, B. napus, A. spheroides and H. in¯uenzae ENRs.

The secondary structure from E. coli and B. napus is shown above and below the sequences, respectively.

The Figure was produced using the programme CINEMA (Attwood et al., 1997).

Previous comparison of the sequence and structure of ENR has shown it to be related to the family of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases (Rafferty et al., 1995). Across the family of shortchain alcohol dehydrogenases (Labesse et al., 1994) a YX3K motif is conserved at the active site with the tyrosine and lysine residues being the proposed

catalytic residues which act as a proton donor and to stabilise the negative charge of the transition state, respectively. As discussed above, their roles in the chemistry of ENR are thought to be similar. However, because of the difference in chemistry between the reduction of a carbon-oxygen double bond in alcohol dehydrogenases and a carbon-car-

1541 E. coli ENR which are replaced by three residues in the B. napus enzyme. In the E. coli ENR structure, residues Asn155 and Asn157, either side of the putative catalytic tyrosine residue, both lie in unfavourable regions of the Ramachandran plot. In both E. coli and B. napus ENRs the residues before the catalytic tyrosine form a type II beta turn which requires a glycine residue at position i  2 if severe steric hindrance between the side-chain of residue i  2 and the peptide carbonyl group of residue i  1 is to be avoided (Schultz & Schirmer, 1979). This is indeed the case in the B. napus enzyme with this residue being Gly197. However, in E. coli ENR the i  2 residue is Asn155 and this residue may be stabilised in this unfavourable conformation by a hydrogen bond from the side-chain oxygen atom of the amide group to the peptide nitrogen atom of Gly102. In M. tuberculosis ENR the turn appears to be closely related to the equivalent turns in E. coli and B. napus ENRs, although subtle shifts force it to be classi®ed as type IV. The residue at position i  2, equivalent to Asn155 in the E. coli enzyme, is Ala157 in M. tuberculosis which lies in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Asn157 in E. coli ENR is also conserved in M. tuberculosis, A. spheroides and H. in¯uenzae ENRs, and is in an unfavourable but not disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot in both the E. coli and M. tuberculosis ENR structures. In the E. coli ENR structure this residue is involved in multiple hydrogen bonding interactions, its mainchain carbonyl group is hydrogen bonded to the peptide nitrogen atom of Gly160 and the sidechain amide group of the asparagine residue forms two direct hydrogen bonds to the main-chain of carbonyl groups of Gln99 and Gly102 and two water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl group of Ile153 and the peptide nitrogen atom of Asn155. The extensive nature of these interactions may well overcome the strain that is incurred by the unfavourable Ramachandran angles. In the M. tuberculosis enzyme the environment of the asparagine residue side-chain is different and there are no equivalent ordered solvent molecules reported in the structure and the equivalent loop containing residues 99 to 102 does not form the same interactions. Nevertheless, the YX6K motifs in the E. coli and M. tuberculosis enzymes are structurally closely related and the Tyr a carbon atoms are in the same position. Detailed examination of the three structures shows that the side-chain torsion angles of the putative catalytic tyrosine residue are identical between E. coli and B. napus ENRs but very different in the M. tuberculosis enzyme. The reason for this is unclear. Location of the fatty acid binding site Examination of the structures of the E. coli, B. napus and M. tuberculosis ENRs shows that there is a patch of predominantly hydrophobic residues

bon double bond conjugated to a keto group in ENR the relative position of these two catalytic residues and the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring is modi®ed (Rafferty et al., 1995). Thus, the tyrosine residue is shifted to allow for the difference in spacing between the site of hydride attack on the substrate and the position of protonation being across one bond in, for example, 3a,20b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD; Ghosh et al., 1994) and three bonds in ENR (Figure 8). In B. napus ENR there are seven residues between the catalytic tyrosine (Y198) and lysine (K206) residues (YX7K) whereas in E. coli ENR there are six residues (YX6K; Y156, K163). Across the family of ENRs the spacing of seven residues occurs only in B. napus ENR whilst that of six residues occurs in E. coli, M. tuberculosis, A. spheroides and H. in¯uenzae enzymes. Despite this difference in the number of intervening residues between the catalytic tyrosine and lysine residues in the motif, the positions in the active site of these two putative catalytic residues in the B. napus and E. coli enzymes are almost identical (Figure 9a). The similarity in ®nal position of these residues appears to be possible because of changes in the local conformation between residues Asn157 and Val158 in

adjacent to the position of the nicotinamide ring and presumed to be important in binding the hydrophobic component of the growing fatty acid chain. However, of the residues in this cluster (Tyr146, Pro191, Met206 and Met256), only Pro191 is completely conserved (Figure 9b). In order to initiate modelling studies, coordinates for a butyryl-CoA moiety were taken from the X-ray crystallographic structure of acyl CoA dehydrogenase (Djordjevic et al., 1995; PDB entry 1BUC) and modelled into the active site of the E. coli ENR-NAD complex. The position of the butyryl CoA was selected such that the growing fatty acid chain is pointed over the C-terminal end of strands b6 and b7 and out of the substrate binding pocket. This places the fatty acid chain near the conserved residues Pro154, Pro191 and the strongly conserved residues (conserved in E. coli ENR and at least two other ENR sequences) Tyr146, Ile153, Asn155, Met206 and Met256 from a different subunit of the tetramer. Residues from

the disordered loop between strand b6 and helix a6 are known to become ordered on the binding of diazaborine, and two hydrophobic residues from this loop, Ile200 and Phe203, make hydrophobic packing interactions with the inhibitor (Baldock et al., 1996a), potentially highlighting their importance in substrate binding. Residues from the equivalent region of the structure of B. napus ENR (Phe246 and Ile247) are also thought to form part of the substrate binding pocket (Rafferty et al., 1995). With the butyryl CoA in this position, the distance between the C3 position of the substrate and the C4 position of the nicotinamide ring, between which hydride transfer occurs, is approxiÊ mately 3.7 A and that between the oxygen atom of the enolate anion and the phenolic oxygen atom of the putative catalytic tyrosine residue approxiÊ mately 3 A. This is consistent with the tyrosine residue being the proton donor to the enolate anion. The putative catalytic lysine residue also lies in this region and small changes in the confor-

1543 further our understanding of the precise molecular basis of the interaction. An important consideration which goes beyond the enoyl-reductase ACP interaction is the possible existence of a much higher level of association of the components of the type II FAS complex into a metabolon which would have implications for metabolic channelling. Interestingly, ACP has been immunolocalised at the subcellular level in both E. coli and plants (Slabas & Smith, 1988). In oilseed rape, ACP is localised to the thylakoid membranes and it was suggested early on that the FAS enzymes are in close spacial proximity (Slabas & Smith, 1988). This view has been con®rmed by recent experimentation on metabolic channelling in plastids (Roughan & Ohlrogge, 1996). In contrast, in E. coli the ACP is distributed throughout the cell. Clearly the association of individual components of the FAS machinery is the subject for future research, but with the availability of overproduced proteins, and the possibilities of co-crystallisation studies, the molecular detail of FAS is liable to be uncovered.

mation of the lysine residue side-chain may allow the positive charge to play a role in stabilising the negatively charged enolate anion and/or the phenolic oxygen atom of the tyrosine residue during the catalytic cycle. With the substrate modelled in this position, the angle between the C4 position of the nicotinamide ring and the C3 position of the substrate is 106 , which is consistent with the molecular dynamics studies of Burgi & Dunitz (1983) who showed that the angle of approach by a nucleotide to a carbonyl group was not perpendicular to the CO bond but at an angle of approximately 105 . The NADH enoyl-ACP reductase from E. coli will use a variety of chain lengths of acyl-ACPs as substrate, ranging from C4 to C16 (Weeks & Wakil, 1968). In the structure of the ENR/NAD complex, the extent of the substrate-binding pocket is such that the major contacts between the enzyme and the substrate would appear to be restricted to the ®rst six to eight atoms of the chain after the carbonyl group at position 1. This is consistent with data on the speci®city of the NADH-speci®c enoyl-ACP reductase of E. coli for various enoylACP substrates (Weeks & Wakil, 1968) which showed that the enzyme has a maximum speci®c activity with enoyl-ACP substrates with a chain length of six to eight carbon atoms. During the biosynthesis of vaccenic acid a cis unsaturated double bond is introduced at a chain length of C10 by the action of a dehydratase/isomerase. The enoyl reductase is not active on this substrate but its elongation product trans 2, cis 5 C12 is utilised. This implies that there is suf®cient ¯exibility in this part of the ENR to accommodate a cis double bond at position 5. The mechanism of chain-length speci®city in both plants and bacteria is quite complex and will involve not only the chain-length speci®city of de novo fatty acid acyl-ACP biosynthetic enzymes but also the speci®cities of acceptor species for complex lipid formation and termination mechanisms. The docking of the fatty acid substrate is not exclusively dependent on the attachment of the acyl group to ACP as acyl-CoAs also serve as substrate for the E. coli NADH-linked enoyl reductase (Weeks & Wakil, 1968). In contrast, the NADPHdependent enoyl reductase activity in E. coli is totally inactive with CoA substrates. A similar situation has been reported for plant enoyl reductase, where spinach-leaf NADH enoyl-ACP reductase will use both acyl-CoA and acyl-ACP substrates with a preference for chain lengths ranging from C4 to C20 (Shimakata & Stumpf, 1982). The NADH-linked enoyl reductases from all sources have a preference for acyl-ACP substrates with the Km for acyl-CoA being approximately two orders of magnitude greater than for acyl-ACP. This implies that there is a preferential binding of acyl ACP to the enzyme as opposed to acyl-CoA. Direct binding of enoyl reductase to ACP has been demonstrated in plants (Slabas et al., 1990) and structural studies on the complex will be needed to

Materials and Methods
Data collection and processing Crystals of E. coli ENR complexed with NAD were grown by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method from buffered PEG 400 solutions as described (Baldock et al., 1996b). Crystals of the ENR-NAD complex belong to spacegroup P21 and have unit cell dimensions Ê Ê Ê of a  74.0 A, b  81.2 A, c  79.0 A, b  92.9 with a tetramer in the asymmetric unit and an assumed solvent Ê content of 41.7% based on a Vm of 2.11 A3DaÀ1 (Matthews, 1968). Medium-resolution native data were collected at room temperature on a twin San Diego multiwire systems (SDMS) area detector (Hamlin, 1985) using a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode source. The Xuong-Hamlin method of data collection was used (Xuong et al., 1985) and the images were processed using SDMS software (Howard et al., 1985). The native NAD complex data set, obtained from one crystal, was 78% Ê complete to 2.5 A. This medium-resolution native data set was merged with a high-resolution data set collected at room temperature on a MAR image plate detector on station 9.5 at the CCLRC Daresbury synchrotron. The high-resolution data were processed using the MOSFLM suite of programs (Leslie, 1992) and the resulting data were merged and scaled using the programs ROTAVATA and AGROVATA (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, 1994). The data were obtained from one Ê crystal and were 92% complete to 2.6 A and 70% comÊ plete to 2.1 A. The medium-resolution mercury-derivative data were collected at room temperature on a MAR image plate detector on station 9.5 at the CCLRC Daresbury synchrotron from a single crystal to a resolution of Ê 3 A. These data were processed using the MOSFLM suite of programs (Leslie, 1992) and the resulting data (73% complete) were merged and scaled using the programs ROTAVATA and AGROVATA. Structure determination The structure was initially solved by molecular replacement using a model of B. napus ENR from which large

1544
insertions corresponding to loop regions in the B. napus structure had been removed after close inspection of a sequence comparison. The cross-rotation function gave a clear solution which produced a peak in the translation function with a height of 17s. The model was re®ned using TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987), but the subsequent map calculated using the re®ned phases was not of suf®cient quality to con®dently assign residues in regions of structural differences between the B. napus and E. coli enzymes. However, the phases provided by the molecular replacement solution were suf®cient to reveal the positions of the heavy atoms in a six-site mercury derivative by difference Fourier methods. Re®nement of the heavy atom parameters was performed using MLPHARE (Otwinowski, 1991), and the derivative had a phasing power of 1.4 and 1.0 for the acentric and centric re¯ections, respectively. The overall mean ®gure of merit for the subsequent isomorphous map was 0.34 for all Ê re¯ections to 3 A resolution. Construction of the model and refinement The isomorphous map was of suf®cient quality to unambiguously position a model for a tetramer of B. napus ENR, and molecular masks for the molecule were generated using the program MAMA (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994). A total of 50 cycles of solvent ¯attening and fourfold molecular averaging using the program DM (Cowtan, 1994) reduced the free R-factor to 0.245. In the resultant electron-density map, calculated using the averaged phases, clear density could be found for all but the ®rst residue, the last four residues and ten residues from the loop joining b6 and a6. A model, comprising 247 of the 262 amino acid residues of the E. coli ENR, could be built with con®dence using the graphics programme FRODO (Jones, 1978) running on an Evans and Sutherland ESV system. Coordinates for the second, third and fourth subunits were generated by non-crystallographic symmetry. Solvent molecules were added using the program WATPEAK (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, 1994) and were accepted or rejected depending on whether they made hydrogen bonds to the protein or other ordered solvent molecules. Solvent molecules were subsequently rejected from the model if their B-factors Ê were above 70 A2 after re®nement. Iterative cycles of rebuilding and re®nement using TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987), which eventually involved the independent ®tting and re®nement of all four subunits, gave a ®nal R-factor for the model of 0.162 (52,346 re¯ections in the range 10Ê 2.1 A, 7839 atoms including 327 water molecules) with Ê an rmsd on bonds of 0.01 A, an rmsd on angles of Ê 1.50deg;, an rmsd on planar groups of 0.02 A, and an Ê rmsd on trigonal atom non-planarity of 0.01 A. The averÊ Ê age B-factor for the tetramer is 33 A2 (27 A2 for mainchain atoms). The solvent-accessible surface area of an isolated monomer and a tetramer of ENR have been calculated using the programme AREAIMOL (Lee & Ê Richards, 1971) using a probe radius of 1.4 A, and are Ê Ê approximately 11,500 A2 and 31,500 A2, respectively. ENR-NADPH data Crystals of E. coli ENR complexed with NADP were grown by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method from buffered PEG 400 solutions. These crystals were then soaked for three hours in 50 mM NADPH. Crystals of the ENR-NADPH complex belong to spacegroup P21 Ê Ê and have unit cell dimensions of a  74.6 A, b  80.8 A,

These data were processed, merged and scaled using the DENZO/ SCALEPACK suite of programs (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The data were obtained from one crystal and were Ê 76% complete to 2.1 A. The ENR-NAD and ENRÊ NADPH data were scaled together from 10 to 2.1 A resolution using the program SCALEIT (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, 1994) with the mean fractional isomorphous difference between them being 30.4%. The ENR-NADPH data was re®ned using the structure of the ENR-NAD complex as a starting model resulting in an R-factor for the model of 0.20.
