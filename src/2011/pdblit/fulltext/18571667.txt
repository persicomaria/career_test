Abstract The gene cyt2Ba of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis was cloned for expression, together with p20, in an acrystalliferous strain. The large hexagonal crystals formed were composed of Cyt2Ba, which facilitated its purification. Crystal solubilization in the presence of endogenous proteases (with spores and cell debris) enabled quick and simple procedure to obtain rather pure and active toxin species by cleavage between amino acid residues 34 and 35, most likely by a camelysin-like protease that was discovered in association with activated Cyt2Ba. The product of this cleavage displayed haemolytic activity comparable to that of exogenously activated Cyt2Ba. The sequence of this putative protease shares high homology with the cell envelope-bound metalloprotease (camelysin) of the closely related species Bacillus cereus. ” 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Bacillus thuringiensis is a gram-positive soil bacterium considered as the most promising biological control agent against insect larvae [1]. During sporulation, this entomopathogenic bacterium produces parasporal crystalline proteins (d-endotoxins), which possess larvicidal and cytolytic activities, as well as endo-proteases [2]. The crystal in subsp. israelensis is composed of four main proteins, Cry4Aa, Cry4Ba, Cry11Aa, and Cyt1Aa. The genes for these and other Cry and Cyt proteins are located on the large plasmid (128 kb) pBtoxis of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis [3]. Analysis of the plasmid sequence revealed, in addition to cyt1Aa, genes for two other Cyt proteins, cyt2Ba [4] and cyt1Ca [3].

Cyt1Aa was the first cytolytic toxin to be isolated and comprehensively characterized [5]. Other cytolytic proteins have been detected later in different strains of B. thuringiensis, some related to Cyt1Aa whereas others have been classified into other groups based on immunological properties and sequence homologies [6]. Purified Cyt1Aa is cytolytic to cells of Dipteran origin, and at several fold higher concentrations, it is also toxic to a broad range of cells from both vertebrate and invertebrate origins [7]. Maximal Cyt1Aa toxicity occurs upon alkali solubilization and proteolysis from both N- and C-termini, converting the pro-toxin of 27 kDa to an activated form (22≠25 kDa) [8]. Cyt2 toxins from various mosquito larvicidal B. thuringiensis subspecies have been identified and partially characterized: Cyt2Aa from darmstadtiensis and kyushensis [9,10], Cyt2Ba, Cyt2Bb, and Cyt2Bc from israelensis [4], jegathesan [11], and medellin [12], respectively.

M. Nisnevitch et al. / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 344 (2006) 99≠105 Cloning cyt2Ba into pHT315 and sequencing. The amplicons cyt1Aa promoter (552 bp), cyt2Ba with downstream sequence (858 bp), and p20 (1024 bp) were purified from agarose gel and digested by the appropriate restriction enzymes. The first two were NdeI-ligated into SphI≠XbaI-digested pHT315, and the latter was subsequently ligated into the XbaI≠SacI sites. DNA was introduced into E. coli XL1-Blue MRF' by electroporation (using a Bio-Rad mini apparatus set). The plasmid was isolated, sequenced, and electroporated into the acrystalliferous strain IPS78/11 of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. Screening for transformants was performedon LB plates containing 20 lg ml¿1 erythromycin at 30 ∞C. Crystals were seen under a phasecontrast microscope. DNA sequences were verified by ABI PRISM“ 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Crystal protein preparation. Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis strain IPS78/11 harboring cyt2Ba, with or without p20, was grown in PGSM medium [18] at 30 ∞C for 4 days with erythromycin (10 lg ml¿1). Cultures were centrifuged (15,000g for 10 min), the Sediment (E) containing crystals, spores, and cell debris was washed twice with cold water (Fig. 1). The crystals were separated from the other components by biphasic separation (1% sodium sulfate, water, dichloroethane 1:1.2:1) for 20 min. The water phase containing the crystals (Sediment N) was centrifuged (45 min at 15,000g) and washed in cold water. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using BSA as a standard. Electron microscopy. Cultures were grown for 48 h in CCY sporulation medium [19], and samples were fixed, dehydrated, embedded, cut, and stained as described before [20]. The sections were dried and viewed by JEOL JEM1230 EM transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Solubilization and activation of crystal protein. Crystals were solubilized, in both, presence (Sediment E) or absence (Sediment N) of cell debris and spores, by incubation at 37 ∞C (1 h in 50 mM Na2CO3, 10 mM DTT) at the pH range of 8≠12, followed by centrifugation. The supernatants containing solubilized Cyt2Ba were adjusted to pH 8 with 1 M Tris≠HCl, pH 6.5. Solubilized Cyt2Ba from Sediment N was activated with 10% w/w of trypsin, chymotrypsin or proteinase K.

shows 39% identity and 70% similarity in amino acid sequence with Cyt1Aa [4], and 67% similarity with Cyt2Ba. The presence of cyt2 genes in various subspecies of B. thuringiensis was correlated with their anti-dipteran activities [6]. A mixture of B. sphaericus with either Cyt2Ba or Cyt1Ab was synergistic towards larvae of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus [13]. Cyt2Bc was about half as active against susceptible mosquitoes as Cyt2Ba, and less toxic than Cyt1Aa by a factor of 4≠12 [6]. Cyt2Bb and Cyt1Aa were comparably haemolytic. Haemolysis by Cyt2Aa displayed a sigmoidal dose≠response curve, suggesting cooperativity between its monomers [10]. The proteolytic enzymes of B. thuringiensis (belonging to the cysteine, metallo, and serine families) can process or degrade protoxins [2]. One of its zinc-requiring metalloproteases, for example, InhA can specifically degrade both the inducible antibacterial peptides and the collagen-containing substrate in various lepidopteran and dipteran larvae [14]. It may thus be implicated in the mechanism by which B. thuringiensis invade the haemocoel and interfere with the immune system of the host. InhA2 metalloprotease is not the primary virulence factor but provides synergism of B. thuringiensis spores to the toxicity of Cry1C against Galleria mellonella following infection via the oral route [15]. Here, cyt2Ba was cloned, with or without the p20 ``helper'' gene, in acrystalliferous strain of B. thuringiensis. Purified Cyt2Ba crystals were solubilized and activated by endogenous and exogenous proteases to explore haemolytic and larvicidal activities of the obtained toxin. A new putative endogenous protease camelysin seems to activate Cyt2Ba protoxin. Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and plasmids. Strain 4Q2-72 of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis, which bears pBtoxis as its only plasmid [3], was kindly supplied by D.R. Zeigler (Bacillus Genetics Stock Center, Colombus, Ohio). The acrystalliferous plasmid-less derivative strain IPS78/11 was kindly obtained from D. Ellar (Cambridge, UK). Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF' (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a host for sub-cloning in the E. coli≠B. thuringiensis 6.5 kb shuttle vector pHT-315 [16]. DNA isolation and PCR amplification. pBtoxis was obtained from exponentially growing cells of strain 4Q2-72 as described before [17]. The following oligonucleotide primers were used for PCR amplifications: For the cyt1Aa promoter: 5 0 -GGGATTTAGAgCATGcTTAAGT AGAATAGACG-3 0 (Pr-cyt1Aa-SphI-D) and 5 0 -CAATGATTTAAATT TTCCATAtgTAAACAACTCC-3 0 (Pr-cyt1Aa-NdeI-R). For cyt2Ba: 5 0 -G GGGGATTATTAAcATATGCACC-3 0 (cyt2Ba-NdeI-D) and 5 0 -ATCT CTCTAgAGTACTATGGCTATTTC-3 0 (cyt2Ba-XbaI-R). For p20: 5 0 -C CGTTtCTAgAGTAGAAGTCATGTTAGC-3 0 (p20-XbaI-D) and 5 0 -CA AATTCATCTGAGcTcTTATATCGATTCAC-3 0 (p20-SacI-R). The small letters in the primers sequence represent bases modified from the original sequence to encode an appropriate enzyme restriction site. Amplification was carried out with the high fidelity Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a DNA MiniCycler (Biometra), under the following conditions: 4 min at 95 ∞C initial denaturation, followed by 30 cycles of 40 s at 95 ∞C, 45 s at 54 ∞C, 1≠2 min at 72 ∞C, and additional step at 72 ∞C for 10 min. Samples from each PCR were electrophoresed on 0.7% agarose gels and DNA visualized by ethidium bromide.

Results and discussion Separation, solubilization, and activation of Cyt2Ba from parasporal crystals The concentration of Cyt2Ba in parasporal crystals of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis is very low and can only be revealed by immunoblot analysis or PCR screening [4]. Therefore, cyt2Ba was cloned, with or without p20 encoding the ``helper'' P20 [25], in the acrystalliferous strain IPS78/11 named IPS (cyt2Ba/p20). Cyt2Ba was assembled to a hexagonal crystal (Fig. 2A), which facilitated its purification (Fig. 1). The size of the hexagonal-shaped crystals produced ranged between 0.4 and 0.6 lm (Fig. 2A); in the absence of p20 (in clone IPS (cyt2Ba)), the crystals were about half the size (data not shown). Likewise, expression of cyt1Aa alone in acrystalliferous strains of B. thuringiensis is poor and no obvious inclusions are observed, whereas relatively large ovoidal, lemon-shaped inclusions of Cyt1Aa are produced in the presence of p20 as well [26]. Furthermore, expression of p20 raises the rate of production of nascent Cry1Ac [27] and heterologous truncated Cry1Ca [28] in acrystalliferous B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, apparently due to protection from endogenous proteases. Indeed, highest endoprotease activity in vivo occurs concurrent with expression of toxins.

Mixtures of Cyt2Ba crystals and spores were added to 10 third instar A. aegypti larvae in 100 ml sterile tap water. Larval viability was counted after 24 h at 28 ∞C as described previously [21]. Values of LC50 and LC95 (concentrations of cells that kill 50% and 95% of the exposed populations, respectively) were determined by probit analysis with eight doses [22]. Azocasein assay. Samples of solubilized Cyt2Ba were added to 1 ml of 0.3% azocasein (Sigma) in 50 mM Tris≠HCl buffer, pH 8, and incubated at 37 ∞C for 1 h as described previously [23].

Sediment E, obtained from strain IPS (cyt2Ba/p20) (crystal protein preparation), including crystals, spores, and debris, was divided into two portions for further purification. The first (Fig. 1, left-hand side) was solubilized and centrifuged, and the supernatant was adjusted to pH 8. The supernatant consisted of a predominant protein band with a molecular mass of 22 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane E), which was designated Cyt2Ba-E for endogenous bacterial proteases that seem to digest the intact Cyt2Ba (see below). The second portion of Sediment E (Fig. 1, right-hand side) was partially purified by biphasic separation. The crystals from the water phase were centrifuged and washed in cold water. This Sediment (designated N for Native Cyt2Ba) was solubilized, centrifuged, and the supernatant pH adjusted to 8. The protein fraction contained a main band on SDS≠PAGE, with molecular mass of about 24 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane N). The crystal purification method described here is based on a biphasic separation using dichloroethane as an organic phase (Fig. 1). The crystals thus obtained were purified only partially and contained relatively high percent of spores and cell debris, but the endogenous proteases contaminating this fraction were removed or inactivated by the organic phase. Thereby, the obtained soluble protein fraction contained only unprocessed, native Cyt2Ba form (Cyt2Ba-N). The haemolytic activity of Cyt2Ba-N was negligible, confirming again the non-processed character of Cyt2Ba (see below). Soluble Cyt2Ba-N was incubated with each of the following proteases, chymotrypsin, proteinase K and trypsin, and the proteolytic products were marked Cyt2Ba-C, Cyt2Ba-P, and Cyt2Ba-T, respectively. All three products yielded a major band of 22 kDa (Fig. 2B, lanes: C, P, T), with the same size as Cyt2Ba-E. An additional treatment of Cyt2Ba-E with the above-mentioned proteases did not affect its molecular weight (data not shown). Crystals of several Cyt2, previously purified by ultracentrifugation on discontinuous sucrose or NaBr gradients, are contaminated by low amounts of spores and debris [11,12,20]. In those cases, however, the associated proteases are still active, and Cyt2 thus obtained is partially degraded. Solubilizing the crystals on ice rather than at 37 ∞C only partially prevents the activity of endogenous proteases [20]. The endogenous protease activity is not entirely abolished even upon adding EDTA to Cyt2Bb inclusions before purification on NaBr gradient [11]. The effect of pH on the efficiency of Sediment N solubilization (Fig. 1) was examined by estimating Cyt2Ba-N concentration and SDS≠PAGE analyses. Sediment N was solubilized upon varying pH of the buffer from 8 to 12. In the lower basic buffers, the quantity of solubilized Cyt2Ba-N was negligible, but strong basic conditions led to rather high concentrations, from 0.8 mg ml¿1 at pH 10.5 to 1.5 mg ml¿1 at pH 12 (data not shown). A significant Cyt2Ba-N band at 24 kDa was only found at the strong basic conditions. However, after processing of these

species by exogenous proteases, the toxin obtained at pH 10.5 was most haemolytic. The low activity of Cyt2Ba solubilized at pH 12 can be explained by changes of the toxin configuration. Endogenous protease activity in Sediment E To examine the possibility that endogenous proteases are responsible for the proteolytic activation of Cyt2Ba-E, Sediment E, containing crystals, spores, and cell debris, was incubated with BSA at 37 ∞C for 1 h. Sediment E cleaved native BSA (66 kDa) to smaller polypeptides (50 and 46 kDa), which could not have been derived from Sediment E itself. Sediment E contained a single protein band with a molecular mass of about 24 kDa (data not shown). It can therefore be concluded that Sediment E contains endogenous protease(s) that degrade native Cyt2Ba (24 kDa) to Cyt2Ba-E (22 kDa), while in the biphasic separation method these proteases are removed or inactivated by the organic phase. Most proteolytic activities in subsp. tenebrionis and kurstaki stem of endogenous metalloproteases, while in subsp. israelensis, 50% activity is contributed by serine proteases [29]. Amino acid fragments of Cyt2Ba-N, Cyt2Ba-E, and the endogenous protease Samples of Cyt2Ba-N and Cyt2Ba-E, excised from PVDF membrane, were subjected to Edman degradation. The N-terminal sequence of Cyt2Ba-N, MHLNN, is identical to that of Cyt2Ba [5], indicated that it was not degraded during purification and solubilization. The N-terminal sequence of Cyt2Ba-E was however indefinite. To clarify the reason for this ambiguity, Cyt2Ba-E (cut from gel) was subjected to total tryptic digestion, and the fragments were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Two peptides that belong to the Cyt2Ba sequence were identified: TVPSSDITNFNEI FYVEPQYIAQAIR and LTNTFQGAIDPLTLNFNF EK. The former was identical to the original amino acid residues 35≠60 of Cyt2Ba [5], but not overlapping the tryptic digest product (cleaved between L (Leu) 34 and T (Thr) 35), as the N-terminus of Cyt2Ba-E, having Threonine-35 as the first residue; it resembles the N-terminus of the previously observed Cyt2Aa [20]. The latter peptide (amino acid residues 61≠80) indeed matched the tryptic cleavage site after arginine (between R (Arg) 60 and L (Leu) 61). The tryptic digest of Cyt2Ba-E surprisingly included 16 additional peptides, nine of which are included in the major seven (Table 1A). Blast analysis discovered that all 7 (totaling 120 amino acids) are identical to parts of the 199 amino acid-long protease camelysin from Bacillus cereus [30], a species closely related genetically to B. thuringiensis [31]. Linking the seven peptides by sequence alignment yielded four larger fragments (and three gaps) found between amino acids 30 and 173 of the latter (Table 1B). The putative

camelysin found here displays 96.6% identity to a metalloprotease of B. thuringiensis subsp. konkukian (Accession No. YP_035508) and 52.9% identity (and 73.9% similarity) to the cell envelope of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (ZP_00738775) (Table 1C). It also resembles putative spore coat-associated proteins, one (with 95.8% identity) of Bacillus anthracis (NP_843760; [32]), another (with 55.4% identity and 75.6% similarity) of pBtoxis from B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (CAD30177; [3]). The proteolytic activity of camelysin is preferentially directed towards the peptide bonds when aliphatic hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid residues are at C side of the peptide bond [33]. The fact that threonine is located at the N-terminus of Cyt2Ba-E suits the concept that camelysin from debris or spore envelope present in Sediment E is responsible for endogenous degradation of Cyt2Ba. The hypothesis that the metalloprotease camelysin is responsible for the activation of Cyt2Ba in Sediment E was tested by solubilizing the crystals in the presence of protease inhibitors. With a metalloprotease inhibitor (OP

or EDTA), the solubilized protein remained at 24 kDa (as Cyt2Ba-N in Fig. 2B) and demonstrated a low haemolytic and typical camelysin activity of 5% and 8%, respectively. However, the main product obtained by solubilization in the presence of the serine proteases inhibitor PMSF had a MW of 22 kDa, as in the absence of any protease inhibitor. These fractions possessed haemolytic activity (65% at 3 h), typical for Cyt2Ba-E, and a rather high proteolytic activity of camelysin towards azocasein (0.006 U). Cyt2Ba-E, purified on DEAE≠cellulose column as a single peak at 0.2≠0.3 M NaCl (Fig. 3), did not possess a typical camelysin proteolytic activity on azocasein; activity of 0.03 U ml¿1 was detected before purification. Bacillus thuringiensis crystal polypeptides are activated in vivo by proteolysis in the insect gut [34,35] and by several endogenous proteases during sporulation [2,36]. Under denaturing/reducing conditions, for instance, such endogenous metalloprotease of subsp. kurstaki mediates proteolytic processing of 132 kDa protoxin to an active 66 kDa toxin [37], highly active against the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis, a species insensitive to native kurstaki crystals or toxins generated by exogenous proteases [38]. Biological activities Haemolysis Haemolytic activities against 0.2% RBC were determined for solubilized and activated Cyt2Ba (20 lg ml¿1). Cyt2Ba-N was only slightly haemolytic (less than 1%).

Trypsin-activated Cyt2Ba-N (Cyt2Ba-T) was 20% and 50% haemolytic within 3 h after solubilization at pH 12 and 10.5, respectively. Processing by chymotrypsin (Cyt2BaC) or proteinase K (Cyt2Ba-K) caused 27% and 34% haemolysis, respectively, after solubilization at pH 10.5. On the other hand, the haemolytic activity of Cyt2Ba-E (56% haemolysis) was not affected by the exogenous proteases. Incubation of varying Cyt2Ba-E concentrations with 0.2% RBC for 3 h yielded an HC50 value for haemolysis of 17.6 lg ml¿1. Inverted correlation was found between RBC concentration and haemolysis in assays performed during 3 h (data not shown): less than 20% at 1% RBC, reaching 70% at 0.1% RBC. When the assay was performed during 20 h, haemolysis was more than 80% at all RBC concentrations. This inverse correlation can be explained by demand for a certain number of toxin molecules needed for haemolysis of each red blood cell on its membrane [39,40]. At 3 h incubation, 100% haemolysis was not achieved even at low RBC concentration, perhaps due to slow aggregation of Cyt2Ba molecules needed for the cell membrane damage. Mosquito larvicidity The activity against A. aegypti larvae of Cyt2Ba crystals in Sediment E was determined in the concentration range of 16≠800 lg ml¿1 by larval mortality after 24 h: values of LC95 and LC50 reached 150 and 33 lg ml¿1, respectively. The previously found 4-fold higher activity of Cyt2Ba against A. aegypti [13] can be explained by different proportion of crystals and spores in the Sediment used. Some B. thuringiensis proteases, synthesized during sporulation, are metalloproteases with possible physiological functions. They can either degrade or activate d-endotoxins and affect toxicity against the target insect, for example. In neutral protease A-deficient strains, Cry3Bb and Cry1Bb were not degraded as they were in the wildtype strain [29,41,42]. Results of such studies may enable to raise efficacy of entomopathogenic bacteria for Integrated Pest Management.
