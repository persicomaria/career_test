The abundance of structural data available for retroviral proteases affords a unique opportunity to investigate structure activity relationships. Our approach attempts to genetically engineer an HIV (human immunode®ciency virus)-1 protease that is functionally equivalent to the HIV-2 and the SIV (simian immunode®ciency virus) enzymes and conversely to engineer an HIV-2 protease that is functionally equivalent to the HIV-1 enzyme. For this purpose, the HIV-2 and SIV proteases were cloned and characterized in an Escherichia coli (E. coli) assay system along with 33 engineered HIV-1 and HIV-2 enzymes. The results of these experiments show that a relatively large S1 or S1H subsite volume, which is likely determined by the conformation of the 80's loop (residues 78 to 85), is necessary to fully accommodate the HIV-1 protease speci®city site AETF*YCDG (the asterisk indicates the location scissile bond) during productive binding.

viral polyprotein precursors, PrGAG and PrGAG-POL (Figure 1) into functional structural proteins and enzymes. This proteolytic activity has been shown to be essential to the viral life cycle (Kohl et al., 1988). Although retroviral proteases belong to the ubiquitous aspartyl protease family, these enzymes possess unique structural and functional properties that distinguish them from their cellular and microbial counterparts (for a review see Fitzgerald & Springer, 1991). For example, a competitive inhibitor speci®c for the HIV-1 protease was shown not to affect human monocyte function in vitro, for which cellular aspartyl proteases are thought to play an essential role (Bugelski et al., 1992). Thus, HIV proteases are attractive therapeutic targets for the identi®cation of anti-viral agents. Figure 1 shows that the primary structure of the HIV-2 protease is more closely related to the simian immuno de®ciency virus (SIV) enzyme than to the HIV-1 enzyme (the amino acid sequences of the HIV-2 ROD and SIV Mn251 proteases are 89% identical whereas HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases are only 45% identical). Consistent with this homology, the activity and inhibitor sensitivity of the HIV-2 and SIV proteases are approximately identical (Fan et al., 1995; Grant et al., 1991; Tomasselli et al., 1992). In contrast to their primary structure,

The proteins matrix, capsid, nucleocapsid, 6 kDa protein, pre-protease leader, protease, reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease H and integrase are abbreviated MA, CA, NC, P6, PPL, PR, RT, H and IN, respectively. 1,2,3,4,4*,5,6,7 and 8 indicate the location and numericl designation of the SQNY*PIVQ, ARVL*AEAM, ATIM*MQRG, PGNF*LQSR, RQAN*FLGK, SFNF*PQIT, TLNF*PISP, AETF*YVDG and RKIL*FLDG HIV-1 IIIb proteolytic sites, respectively (the asterisks indicate the location of the scissile bonds). The expanded region represents the primary amino acid structure alignment of the proteases from HIV-1 IIIb (Shaw et al., 1984), HIV-2 ROD (Clavel et al., 1986) and SIV Mn251 (Kornfeld et al., 1987). The amino acid residues in bold are identical in the three enzymes. The approximate location of amino acid residues within the three-dimensional structures of retroviral proteases is indicated below the primary sequence. The scale is shown in bp and amino acids (aa).

X-ray crystallographic analysis has revealed that most secondary and tertiary structures are conserved in retroviral proteases (Fitzgerald &

Springer, 1991). In their three-dimensional structure, these enzymes are homodimers, the protomers (Mr $ 11,000) of which are related to each

Enzymatic hydrolysis of nine HIV-1 IIIb PrGAG and PrGAG-POL speci®city sites (Figure 1) by wild-type and substituted retroviral proteases was carried out within intact AR120 (N99:galÀ, lambda PL-LacZ fusion UvrB, Tn10::NAD, tetR, lambda Cl) cells. As described by Stebbins et al. (1996) the P4-P4H residues of nine HIV-1 protease speci®city sites have been genetically engineered into bacterial galactokinase in order to create heterologous substrates. Each heterologous substrate was assayed by co-inducing two independently replicating vectors, which encoded a substrate and a protease precursor, respectively. Following induction cell lystates are analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a galactokinase-speci®c monoclonal antibody. The species corresponding to the intact substrate or the amino-terminal product of proteolysis were determined by electrophoretic co-migration with the control substrate protein, which is not proteolyzed, or an amino-terminal fragment of galactokinase, respectively. The symbols  or * indicate that the product of enzymatic hydrolysis is or is not detected, respectively. a The numerical rows correspond to the numerical designations of the HIV-1 IIIb proteolytic sites (Figure 1), which were genetically engineered into galactokinase. b Using the E. coli vector pOTSKF33 (Chiang et al., 1989) or the functionally equivalent pOTSf1 (Towler et al., 1996) the HIV-1 IIIb, tethered HIV-1 IIIb, SIV Mn251 and HIV-2 ROD proteases were all expressed as precursors, which auto process into mature and active enzymes within intact bacterial cells. The cloning and expression of the HIV-1 protease as well as the construction and expression of the tethered HIV-1 protease has been previously described (Stebbins & Debouck, 1994). For the SIV protease, a portion of the pol gene encoding the protease domain ¯anked by upstream and downstream sequences was isolated from the SIV Mn251 strain by restriction endoncuclease digestion. Speci®cally, a 972 bp StuI to ScaI DNA fragment was isolated from a subclone of SIV Mn251 also referred to as BK28 or HTLV-4 (Kornfeld et al., 1987). This fragment comprised the 99 codons of the mature protease plus 59 codons and 110 codons immediately 5H and 3H , respectively, of the protease domain. The 972 bp fragment was then inserted in frame into in the pOTSKF33 expression vector. The translation product of this construct is a fusion protein consisting of 56 amino acid residues from the vector followed by 268 residues from SIV Mn251 PrPOL. For the HIV-2 protease, a portion of the pol gene encoding the protease domain ¯anked by upstream and downstream sequences was isolated from the HIV-2 ROD strain (Clavel et al., 1986) by PCR. Speci®cally, a 620 bp PCR product was generated from DNA encoding the HIV-2 ROD genome. This product comprised the 99 codons of the mature protease plus 78 codons and 22 codons immediately 5H and 3H , respectively, of the protease domain. Following con®rmation of the DNA sequence by the dideoxy sequencing method, the 620 bp fragment was then inserted in frame into either the pOTSKF33 or the pOTSf1 expression vector. The translation product of this construct is a fusion protein consisting of 56 amino acid residues from the vector followed by 199 residues from the HIV-2 ROD PrPOL. c Introduction of amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 IIIb or HIV-2 ROD protease was accomplished by oligonucleotide site-speci®c mutagenesis, as previously described by Stebbins et al. (1996) or by Towler et al. (1996). Introduction of amino acid substitutions in the tethered HIV-1 protease was accomplished by oligonucleotide site-speci®c mutagenesis (Zoller & Smith, 1982), with the modi®cations previously described (Ladjimi et al., 1988). For mutations in the 5H region of the structural gene a BamHI to SacI 643 bp fragment was used and for mutations in the 3H region of the structural gene a SacI to XbaI 400 bp fragment was used. Following mutagenesis, these DNA fragments were then combined with the appropriate DNA fragment from the PROT vector (Stebbins & Debouck, 1994). Final vector construction was con®rmed by restriction endonuclease analysis, dideoxy DNA sequencing and protease expression.

470 other by a C-2 intramolecular axis of symmetry. With the exception of two a-helices, the molecule is predominantly composed of b-sheet structures that include a tightly bound interchain interface near the amino and carboxy termini (Grant et al., 1992). A single shared active site is located in a central cavity that contains the two catalytic aspartly groups (one from each protomer). The sidechains of the octapeptide substrates (P4-P4H ) form intermolecular interactions at eight subsites of an extended binding site (S4-S4H ). The polypeptide chain of the substrate also forms b-sheet interactions with two ¯exible regions of the enzyme (one from each protomer) called the ¯aps. Upon substrate binding the ¯aps move into the active site trapping a single structural water molecule that interacts with both enzyme and substrate. In addition to the native structure, the HIV-1 protease can also be genetically engineered to function as a single polypeptide chain (for a review see Stebbins & Debouck, 1994). This tethered HIV-1 protease consists of two intact protomers covalently linked from the carboxy terminus of the ®rst chain to the amino terminus of the second chain by the residues Gly-Gly-Ser-Ser-Gly, which creates a single chain 203 residue long enzyme (Mr $ 22,000). With the exception of a covalently linked dimeric interface, the three-dimensional structure (Bhat et al., 1994) as well as the activity (Stebbins & Debouck, 1994) of this enzyme is identical to the native HIV-1 protease. Functional analysis of the HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV enzymes has revealed signi®cant differential activity toward the HIV-1 speci®city site that separates the reverse transcriptase and Rnase H domains of the PrGAG-POL (site 7 in Figures 1 to 3 and Table 1). The P4-P4H amino acid residues corresponding to the sequence of this site are AETF*YVDG (the asterisk indicates the location scissile bond). Speci®cally, when using synthetic peptide substrates that are based on the AETF*YVDG sequence, the HIV-2 and SIV proteases show a 6.4fold (Fan et al., 1995) and a ®vefold (Grant et al., 1991) decrease, respectively, in kcat/Km as compared to the value obtained for the HIV-1 protease. More dramatically, the HIV-2 and SIV proteases are unable to hydrolyze the AETF*YVDG speci®city site when it is inserted into a heterologous protein (Table 1, Stebbins & Debouck, 1994). However, HIV-2 and SIV enzymes are able to hydrolyze all the other eight HIV-1 speci®city sites described in Figure 1. Non-conserved active site residues We initially reasoned that non-conserved residues in the active site could be responsible for functional dissimilarity between retroviral proteases. In retroviral proteases, non-conserved active site residues occur at positions 32, 47, 76 and 82 (Gustchina & Weber, 1991). Speci®cally, Val, Ile, Leu and Val occur at positions 32, 47, 76 and 82, respectively, in the HIV-1 protease whereas Ile,

Val, Met and Ile, respectively, occur at these positions in the HIV-2 protease (Figure 1). Further, the side-chains of the residues at positions 32, 47 and 76 lie in the S2(S2H ) subsite and the side-chain of the residue at position 82 lies in the S1(S1H ) subsite. Thus, these non-conserved residues are implicated as being important for interactions with the substrate and were targeted for substitutional analysis in the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. The data in Table 1 demonstrate that substitutions in the active site do not alter activity towards the AETF*YVDG speci®city site. Similar to the activity of the wild-type HIV-1 enzyme, the quadruple substituted HIV-1(V32I,I47V,L76M,V82I) protease can process all engineered heterologous substrates. Similar to the activity of the wild-type HIV-2 enzyme, the quadruple substituted HIV-2(I32V,V47I,M76L,I82V) protease can process all engineered heterologous substrates with the exception of the substrate containing the AETF*YVDG sequence. Analogous results were also obtained with single, double and triple substituted versions of both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases with changes at positions 32, 47, 76 and 82. Taken together, these results indicate that the functional dissimilarity between the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases are conferred by non-conserved residues outside of the active site. Modeling of the HIV-1(V32I,I47V,L76M,V82I) protease revealed that this enzyme is able to bind the AETFYDG octapeptide in a similar fasion to that of the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). In the HIV-1 (V32I,I47V,L76M,V82I) model docked with the AETFYVDG octapeptide, the substitutions at positions 32, 76 and 47 seem to have minimal effect due to their proximity to the surface and surrounding ¯exible ligands. This is seen, for example, in the displacement of Glu58 away from Met76 and the displacement of Thr80 away from Ile32 both towards the surface of the enzyme. The substitution of Ile at position 82 introduces an extra methyl group into the S1(S1H ) subsite and seems to effect the S1 subsite more than the S1H subsite. Speci®cally, Phe at the P1 position rotates away from the subsite by approximately 30 degrees, whereas the Try at the P1H position rotates by less than 10 degrees. Nonetheless, the overall size of the S1(S1H ) subsite de®ned by these residues is not changed dramatically, which likely explains the ability of the HIV-1(V32I,I47V,L76M,V82I) enzyme to bind the AETF*YVDG speci®city site in a productive fashion. In contrast to the HIV-1(V32I,I47V,L76M,V82I) model, the HIV-2(I32V,V47I,M76L,I82V) model docked with the AETFVDG octapeptide (Figure 2A) predicts a conformational shift of the polypeptide chain from residue 25 to 29 in a single protomer. This displacement disrupts the hydrogen-bonding pattern between the Asp25 and the scissile carbonyl of the octapeptide by forcing Asp25 away from its wild-type conformation. This would seem to be a substantial change that could account for the lack of processing of the AETF*YVDG speci®city site by

Differences are also noted in the S2(S2H ) subsite, where Val32 and Leu76 increase the size of the subsites and the Val at the P2H of the octapeptide is seen to lie deeper into the S2H subsite. Non-conserved proline and dimer interface residues In an attempt to de®ne the residues, which impart differential activity towards the AETF*YVDG speci®city site, non-conserved residues outside of the active site were investigated in combination with non-conserved active site residues. First, nonconserved Pro residues at positions 39, 40 and 79 (Figure 1) were targeted for substitutional analysis in the HIV-1 protease. Second, non-conserved dimer interface residues at positions 3, 67, 95 and 99 (Figure 1) were targeted for substitutional analysis in the HIV-2 protease. These residues have previously been implicated as being important for the native conformation of retroviral proteases (Grant et al., 1992; Strickler et al., 1989; Zhao et al., 1993). The data in Table 1 demonstrate that neither non-conserved Pro residues nor non-conserved dimer interface residues alone are responsible for the functional dissimilarity between the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. Similar to the activity of the wild-type HIV-1 enzyme, the quadruple (HIV1(V32I,P39G,G40P,I47V,V82I)) and penta-substituted (HIV-1(V32I,I47V,P79D,V82I)) proteases can process all engineered heterologous substrates (Table 1). Similar to the activity of the wildtype HIV-2 enzyme, the octa-substituted HIV2(F3I,I32V,V47I,L67C,M76L,I82V,M95C,L99F) protease can process all engineered heterologous substrates with the exception of the substrate

containing the AETF*YVDG sequence. It is noteworthy that the quadruple substituted HIV2(F3I,L67C,M95C,L99F) protease with changes only in the dimer interface is inactive and the precursor of the enzyme does not auto process (data not shown). In contrast, when additional substitutions were made in the active site in order to generate the HIV-2(F3I,I32V,V47I,L67C,M76L,I82V,M95C,L99F) enzyme, substrate hydrolysis activity (Table 1) and auto processing activity were restored (data not shown), demonstrating a close relationship between the conformation of dimer interface and activity (Grant et al., 1992; Strickler et al., 1989). HIV-1 protease asymmetry Molecular asymmetry in the active site of the HIV-1 protease has been described in the threedimensional structure of the enzyme complexed with the CGP 53820 inhibitor (Priestle et al., 1995). In contrast, the three-dimensional structure of the HIV-2 enzyme complexed with the CGP 53820 inhibitor is not asymmetric in this same region (Priestle et al., 1995). This conformational difference is demonstrated by the position of the CGP 53820 cyclohexyl ring, which is displaced by as much as Ê 1.9 A between the two structures. This displacement of cyclohexyl ring is apparently due to an asymmetric peptide chain conformation in the HIV-1 protease at residues 78 to 85 (80's loop), which is pulled away from the active site approxiÊ mately 1.3 A. The asymmetric conformation of the 80's loop is also present in the wild-type HIV-1 model docked with the AETFYVDG octapeptide (data not shown). These results suggest that the S1H subsite is effectively larger in the HIV-1 protease as compared to the S1H subsite of the HIV-2 protease.

Polypeptide chains in green and red correspond to the wild-type and substituted model, respectively. The side-chains of the catalytic aspartyl residues from each protomer (A and B) are shown in both models. The polypeptide chain from residue 25 to 29, which is signi®cantly displaced between the two models, is shown in purple and blue in the wild-type and substituted model, respectively.

Structural analysis of the wild-type and substituted proteases was performed using CHARMM (Brooks et al., 1983) and QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc.), on an Indigo workstation (Silicon Graphics, Inc.). The initial models used were the HIV-1 protease bru isolate structure (Priestle et al., 1995), the HIV-2 ROD isolate structure (Priestle et al., 1995) and the HIV-1 tethered dimer structure (Bhat et al., 1994). The HIV-1 and the HIV-2 structures are both complexed with the CGP 53820 inhibitor and hence were deemed suitable initial models for comparing the two proteases. The protein package in QUANTA was used to generate substituted models. In some cases, the AETFYVDG ocatpeptide was docked into the active site of these models using the X-ray crystallographic determined conformation of the CGP 53820 inhibitor as a template. Water molecules from the original crystal structures were used to solvate the models. Minimization, using decreasing harmonic constraints to restrain the models, was performed as follows: hydrogen atoms were placed using the HBUILD facility in CHARMM. Ê A non-bonded cut-off of 12 A and a constant dielectric was used in all calculations. The non-bonded list was set to update when necessary using the default heuristic method in CHARMM. The minimization was performed in three steps: First, when necessary the substrate was minimized in the ®eld of the static enzyme to relieve any steric clashes. Second, the peptide chain atoms were ®xed and harmonic constraints of 100 kcal/mol placed on the side-chain atoms. 100 steps of steepest descents and 100 steps of adopted-basis Newton Raphson minimization (ABNR) were performed. The harmonic restraints were lowered by 10 kcal/mol and the minimization repeated. This was repeated until the restraints were 0 kcal/mol. The entire procedure was then performed on the peptide chain atoms with the side-chains being free of restraints. Finally, the complex was minimized with 1000 steps of steepest descents and 1000

473 site of the HIV-2 or SIV proteases and thus the P1 or P1H residues of the AETF*YVDG speci®city site are likely not optimally bound by these enzymes. The above results demonstrate that the S1(S1H ) subsite of the HIV-2 and SIV proteases is more sterically constrained as compared to the S1(S1H ) subsite of the HIV-1 protease and this steric constraint plays a signi®cant role in the functional dissimilarity between the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. Following the above analysis, we sought to further elucidate the role of the S1(S1H ) subsite in the functional dissimilarity between the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. In the HIV-1 protease, non-conserved residues at positions 79 and 85 (Figure 1), which border the S1(S1H ) subsite (Gustchina & Weber, 1991), were targeted for substitutional analysis in combination with the Ile substitution at position 82. The data in Table 1 demonstrate that non-conserved residues at positions 79 and 82 alone are not responsible for the functional dissimilarity between retroviral proteases. Similar to the activity of the wild-type HIV-1 protease, the HIV1(P79D) and HIV-1(P79D,V82I) enzymes can process all engineered heterologous subsrates. In contrast to the Asp substitutions at position 79, all substituted versions of the HIV-1 protease with a Phe at position 85 were inactive (Table 1) and the precursors of these enzymes do not auto process (data not shown). The substitution of Phe at position 85 in the HIV-1 protease, which presumably results in improper folding of the enzyme, was further analyzed using the energy minimized structures of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases (data not shown). In comparing these structures, Ile and Ile occur at positions 13 and 66, respectively, in the HIV-1 protease, whereas Ala and Val occur at these positions in the HIV-2 protease, respectively. In the case of the HIV-2 protease these residues serve to deepen a hydrophobic pocket, in which the side-chain of Phe85 lies. Coupled with a movement of Ile64, this appears to accommodate the phenyl group. Modeling of this change in the HIV1 enzyme implies that introducing a Phe at position 85 in the analogous hydrophobic pocket of the HIV-2 protease would results in steric crowding and an overall decrease in structural stability. It can also be gathered from the HIV-1 protease/ CGP 53820 structure that the asymmetric conformation of the 80's loop may be stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network between Lys20, Glu34 and Gln83. As Val and Ala occur at positions 20 and 34, respectively, in HIV-2, a similar hydrogen bonding network is not possible. Thus, the nonconserved residues at positions 20 and 34 (Figure 1) were targeted for substitutional analysis in the HIV-1 protease. The data in Table 1 demonstrate that non-conserved residues at positions 20 and 34 alone are not responsible for the functional dissimilarity between the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. Similar to the activity of the wild-type HIV-1 enzyme, the HIV-1(K20V) and the HIV-1(E34A) enzymes can process all engineered heterologous substrates. These results also suggest that this

The numerical lanes correspond to the numerical designations of the HIV-1 IIIb proteolytic sites (Figure 1), which were genetically engineered into galactokinase. Substrate and Product indicate the migration of the control proteins for the substrate and the amino-terminal product of proteolysis, respectively. For the HIV-1(V82W)t and HIV1(V186W)t enzymes processing of the substrate containing the AETF*YVDG sequence (site 7) was not observed even after extended induction periods (>16 hours). The migration and size (Mr Â 1000) of the molecular weight markers are shown.

In order to further investigate this molecular asymmetry, the S1 and S1H subsites of the HIV-1 protease were independently modi®ed by the introduction of a steric constraint. For this purpose, a bulky Trp residue was substituted for either the Val82 residue or the Val186 residue in the tethered version of the HIV-1 protease. In addition, the HIV-1(V82A)t, HIV-1(V186A)t and HIV-1(V82A) enzymes were used as controls for the removal of the natve side-chain. As seen in Table 1 and Figure 3, the HIV-1(V82W)t and HIV-1(V186W)t enzymes are able to process all engineered heterologous substrates with the exception of the substrate containing the AETF*YVDG sequence. The processing activity of the HIV-1(V82W)t and HIV1(V186W)t enzymes is qualitatively identical to the activity of the wild-type HIV-2 and SIV proteases, whereas the processing activity of the HIV1(V82A)t, HIV-1(V186A)t and HIV-1(V82A) enzymes is similar to the activity of the wild-type HIV-1 protease (Table 1). Modeling of the HIV-1(V82W)t and HIV1(V186W)t enzymes (Figure 2B) revealed that the increased bulk of the Trp residues may act to occlude the S1(S1H ) subsite and in turn prevent optimal binding of either the Phe at the P1 position or the Tyr at the P1H position of the AETF*YVDG speci®city site. During energy minimization, no other major structural effects of the Trp substitution was detected. The HIV-1(V82W)t and HIV1(V186W)t active sites presumably mimic the active

474 hydrogen bonding network may not be important for the stabilization of the 80's loop's asymmetric conformation in the HIV-1 enzyme. Conclusion The above substitutional analysis of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases implicates non-conserved residues outside of the active site as being important for the functional dissimilarity between these enzymes. It is likely that these non-conserved residues affect activity by altering the conformation of the active site. Priestle et al. (1995) have identi®ed a signi®cant conformational difference between the active sites of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. Speci®cally, the conformation of the 80's loop in the HIV-1 protease/CGP 53820 structure effectively increases the volume of the S1H subsite as compared to the S1H subsite volume of the HIV-2 protease/CGP 53820 structure. Our asymmetric substitutional analysis and modeling studies reveal that this increased volume of the S1 or S1H subsite is necessary to fully accommodate either the phenyl ring at the P1 position or the phenolic ring a the P1H position of the HIV-1 AETF*YVDG speci®city site during productive binding.
