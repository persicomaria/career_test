Abstract

Crystals of analcime were synthesized; the size was about 200 un~. The diffraction data were collected with both cubic system and trigonal system from the same crystal. The crystal parameters were completely cubic and the space group was Za3d, but the R-factor only dropped to about 10%. The R-factor was lowered to 0.048 with the trigonal system. This result shows that every pseudo-cubic or average cubic analcime is really trigonal (Rj). The unit cell !size is a half of the cubic cell size, i.e. Nas[AlsSi,60,,J. 8Hz0, a = 11.909(5) A, a=109.51(3)". 0 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
structure of analcime, crystal The NaAlSi,O,. HZO, was determined by Taylor [l] and refined by Calleri and Ferraris [2], Knowles et al. [3] and Ferraris et al. [4]. However, they always refer to the cubic space group Zu3d although analcime has been known to deviate from cubic symmetry [5]. On the other hand, Mazzi and Galli [6] showed tetragonal and orthorhombic analcime structures. However, even their work could give no answer concerning the pseudo-cubic analcime structure problem. In all cubic cases,the R-factors are about 10% or so [3] without exclusion of many reflections [4]. These results have suggestedthat the pseudo-cubic structure of analtime is not completely determined yet. Takaishi and coworkers [7-91 have developed a new theory to determine the ordered distribution of Al atoms

in a zeolitic framework by combining X-ray structural and 29SiNMR data. Recently, Takaishi [lo] showed from his Al ordering theory that analcime should have stable structures with the symmetry of trigonal (R3 and Rj). In the course of checking the validity experimentally, we synthesized large single analcime crystals and determined the structure with the symmetry of R% Here we summarize the results and show that the ideal topological symmetry of analcime is not cubic but trigonal

(Rj).

Synthesis

Tetraethylorthosilicate was weighed into a Teflon beaker. To this, tetramethylammonium bromide (TMABr) was added, followed by the addition of distilled water. The reactants were mllxed

and a solution of NaCl and NaOH and water was added. The mixture was stirred for 1 h. Gels were formed by mixing of aluminum isopropoxide with distilled water and stirring for 1 h. Then the gels were added to the mixture. The mixture was aged at 80°C for about 3 h with stirring and then sealed in a 200 ml Teflon-lined autoclave. The mixture was heated without agitation under autogeneous pressure at 200°C for 141 h. The formal molar composition of the mixture was 13Si0,: Al,O,: 4Na,0:138NaC1:3TMA20:3480H,0. The samples were cooled, washed, and dried at 100°C for 1 day.
2.2. Analysis

The transparent crystals have an icosatetrahedron shape. The size is determined to be about 200 urn diameter by scanning electron microscopy (see Fig. 1). The water content was 8.3% by thermal gravimetric analysis. This shows the crystal has 8H,O in the trigonal unit cell. The WA1 ratio is 2.1 by the MAS NMR method.

data are corrected for Lorentz-polarization effects but not for absorption and extinction effects. Averaging for trigonal symmetry yielded 2039 unique reflections. The structure was determined by direct methods (MULTAN82 [ll]), refined by the full-matrix least squares method (MolEN) using 1649 observations with ]&`,I>3o(F,). was minimized; w = crp'. Atomic ~w-0 - 1~,112 scattering factors are from International Tables for X-Ray Crystallography [ 121. All parameters were unconstrained, especially those for Na and the oxygen of water. In ideal analcime, the eight Na ions should lie in two sixfold sites. In the present refinement, the populations of 3.8 and 3.6 for the Nal and Na2 sites are less than the each population of 4, and random occupancy is assumed. The final difference map shows +0.9(2) e- AV3 and -0.0(2) e- A-". The former means the hydrogen of water. The final refinement with anisotropic temperature factors is as follows: unit cell Na,[Al,Si,@,,] .8H,O; space group R3 (#148);a=11.909(5)A, cr=109.51(3)",Z=l, R= 4.8%. R,=5.8% (no hydrogen atom contained), S= 1.92, (d/a),,, =O.OO.
2.2.2. X-ray analysis., cubic system

Cell constants were obtained at 293 K from a least-squares analysis of the angular settings of 25 reflections (9 <8< 13") on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer with MO Kcl (i, =0.71073 A) radiation and carbon monochromator. The 3292 reflections were collected in the ~20 scan mode from a quarter of the sphere of reflection (h 0 to 16. k 0 to 16, I - 16 to 16) at room temperature;

Generally, the trigonal crystal system should be transformed to a cubic system when the crystal parameters are both a = b = c and a = fi = y = 109.5". After transformation, we also collected the cliffraction data from the same crystal with the cubic crystal system. Refinement of 25 reflections gave cubic cell dimensions within experimental error: 13.711(3), 13.708(2), 13.712(3)& 90.02(l), 90.01(l), 89.99(l)". A total of 15860 diffraction intensities was collected from a full sphere of reflection (h -15 to 15, k -15 to 15, I - 15 to 15) with the 0-20 technique. The systematic absencesof the reflections demonstrated an Ilattice and the presenceof the hhl diffraction with 2/z+ E= 4n and showed the Ia3d space group. Maximum intensity variation of three standard reflections (-1 7 -4, 72 3, -4 -6 6) measured every 100 reflections was less than 0.8% during data collection Averaging for cubic symmetry yielded 312 unique diffraction intensities and gave 246 reflections above background at the 317level. Intensity data were corrected for Lorentz-polarization

effects, but not for absorption and extinction effects. After a few cycles of the full-matrix least squares method (MolEN) using the starting coordination [4], the R factor dropped to 0.102. Without any corrections of diffraction data, this R factor was not lowered any more. However, the calculations show that this crystal symmetry is pseudo-cubic and the real space group is trigonal R5 (#148). 3. Results and discussion The reflection data of both cubic and trigonal crystal system were collected from the samecrystal.

It was concluded that this analcime is trigonal (R3) from the least-squares calculation. Furthermore, it was also concluded that every average cubic analcime or pseudo-cubic analcime, as it has been called by Taylor [ 1] since 1930, is really trigonal. The structure of trigonal analcirne is topologically identical to that of the cubic phase described by Taylor [ 11,Knowles et al. [ 31 and that of the non-cubic phase by Mazzi and Galli [6]. However, the space group is not cubic (Iu3d) but trigonal R$, so that the unit cell size is a half of the pseudo-cubic cell (Na,,[Al&QO,,] . 16H,O). The structure is shown in Fig. 2. Final atomic coordinates and equivalent thermal parameters are shown in Table 1. Bond lengths are shown in

Table 2 and bond angles are listed in Table 3. None of the framework atoms and sodium ions and water molecules shows significant anisotropic therma1 vibration. The mean bond distances (T-O) are between 1.647 and 1.650 A. We must conclude that the Al distribution is random in this crystal

with the space group. However, there are still very complicated problems concerning the Al distribution [lo]. Nal is surrounded by a distorted octahedron, consisting of four oxygen atoms (Ole, 02e, 06, 07b) and two water molecules (Owl, OW2). Na2

is also surrounded by four oxygen atoms (03b, 04b, 05, 08d) and two water molecules (OW2, OW2f ). Each sodium ion occupies four positions of general position (6f) and the total number of sodium ions should be eight in the unit cell. However, in this work, the occupancy factors of Nal and Na2 are 0.64 and 0.61 respectively and the total number of sodium ions is only 7.5. The Na atoms display anisotropy with the maximum displacement in the direction of the water molecules.

OWI occupies threefold position (2~). OW2 occupies the general position (6f ). The total number of water molecules in the unit cell is eight. Owl is supported by three nearest sodium ions (Nal, Nalj, Nalk) and OW2 is also supported by three sodium ions (Nal, Na2, Na21). The thermal vibrations of the water molecules display anisotropy, with the maximum axis perpendicular to the plane of the three nearest Na atoms. The dihedral angle of the two planes is 71". Analcime has four kinds of one-dimensional

The other three channels are also paralleled to the pseudo-threefold rotation axes. OW2 is located on the center of these channels. These four channels are not permitted to intersect, but they do contact each other. Every sodium cation is located on the contact point. In particular, Nal cations are located on the contact points of the channel which is paralleled to the threefold rotation axis.
