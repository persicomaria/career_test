Abstract--A study on substitutions at the four open positions on the phenyl ring of the 1,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazoles as potent CHK-1 inhibitors is described. Bis-substitution at both the 6- and 7-positions led to inhibitors with IC50 values below 0.3 nM. The compound with the best overall activities (36) was able to potentiate the anti-proliferative effect of doxorubicin in HeLa cells by at least 47-fold. Physicochemical, metabolic, and pharmacokinetic properties of selected inhibitors are also disclosed. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concept of sensitizing cancer to the effects of DNAdamaging agents through inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK-1) has been well established.1 CHK-1 is activated via phosphorylation by its upstream kinases ATR and/or ATM upon DNA damage, leading to phosphorylation and degradation of CDC25A. The downstream event is the inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 or cyclin B/Cdc2 kinases, which ultimately causes cell cycle arrest at S or G2/M phase.2 The effectiveness of the DNA-damaging agents faces deterioration since the p53-deficient cancer cells have a mechanism of repairing themselves at the S or G2/M phases. Therefore, inhibition of CHK-1 to abrogate S and/or G2/M checkpoints can drive cancer cells into premature mitosis and apoptosis. On the other hand, the DNA-damaging agents have little impact on normal cells since they have the ability to arrest through p53-mediated G1 checkpoint.3 Recently, we disclosed a new class of 1,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazole compounds as potent and selective

CHK-1 inhibitors (Chart 1).4 Our early study was focused on investigating the structural biology of this class of molecules. We learned that key extra hydrogen bondings between the phenolic alcohol (or corresponding carboxylic acid) of the inhibitors to the polar region of the kinase in the active site were needed for high potency, in addition to the bidentate hydrogen bonding between the pyrazole part of the molecules and the hinge region of the kinase. However, the substitution on the phenyl ring of the tricyclic pyrazole core was limited at the 6-position with narrow variations. In this paper, we explore the expanded substitution types and positions around the fused phenyl ring while keeping the bi-aryl phenol at the 3-position. In addition, we disclose the metabolic, physicochemical, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of selected potent inhibitors and our initial attempt to optimize the PK properties.

Scheme 1 outlines how compounds 10­13, carrying an acetylamino linker at the 6-position, were synthesized. The pyrazole portion of the known compound 15 was protected by SEM and the acetyl amino group was introduced at the 6-position following a Buchwald protocol6 to give 2. Both the acetyl and the SEM groups were removed with HCl. The aniline nitrogen was subsequently converted to the chloroacetamide. The resulting compound 3 was iodonated at the 3-position using NIS followed by nucleophilic substitution with various amines to complete the side-chains at the 6-position. The bi-aryl phenol was then installed via a Suzuki coupling providing 10­13. The synthesis of bis-substituted compounds 33­42 is shown in Scheme 2. 6-Methoxy-1-indanone 28 was treated with NaH and ethyl formate followed by pyrazole ring closure in the presence of hydrazine and acetic acid. Compound 29 was lithiated and treated with DMF to afford the aldehyde 30. Iodonation using NIS gave 31. The formyl group at the 6-position was oxidized to the carboxylic acid, which was in turn converted into an amide using either HOBT/EDC or PyBOP coupling conditions. The bi-aryl phenol unit was introduced in the final step to complete the synthesis of 33­37. Meanwhile, reductive amination on the formyl group of 31 followed by Suzuki coupling afforded compounds 38­42. The synthesis of 48 (Scheme 3) with a gem-dimethyl group at the 4-position of the tricyclic core started with 43 prepared via a known protocol.7 The phenolic alcohol of 43 was protected with a SEM group followed by pyrazole formation to provide 44. Protection of the pyrazole nitrogen and selective removal of the SEM on the phenol gave 45. The resulting hydroxyl group was converted into an amide via a triflate intermediate

with good yield. The remaining transformations were completed using well-developed chemistry resulting in 48. The yield for the final Suzuki coupling step was much higher if the pyrazole nitrogen was protected. The synthesis of compounds 49­52 (Scheme 4) was similar to the procedures reported earlier.4 Our earlier work on 1,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazoles4 had limited substitution patterns on the phenyl ring of the tricyclic core since all of the inhibitors carried extended side-chains with either an aminomethyl or an aminocarbonyl linker at the 6-position, exemplified by 6 or 7 (Table 1). As indicated in the same table, a smaller substitution such as a hydroxyl or a hydroxymethyl showed similar potency. Both 8 and 9 possessed IC50 values below 10 nM. However, the unsubstituted compound (5) suffered a dramatic potency loss (IC50 = 1373 nM). Compounds having side-chains linked by an acetylamino group (10­13) uniformly performed well in the enzymatic assay. With an IC50 value at 0.74 nM, inhibitor 13 was the most potent compound containing a 6-position substitution. We also investigated substitutions on the remaining three open positions (5, 7, and 8) of the phenyl ring with results displayed in Table 2. Within the CHK-1 binding pocket,10 the substitution at the 5-position is sandwiched by protein walls with a narrow opening. The small groups were well tolerated at the 5-position as

14 and 15 possessed IC50 values between 5 and 8 nM. However, the potency deteriorated upon increasing the size of the substitution. As such, compound 16 suffered a greater than 20-fold drop in its activity, while 17 and 18 with long and bulky side-chains completely lost potency. Substitutions at the 7-position are outside of the binding cavity and extended into the solvent similar to those at the 6-position. Consequently, groups with variable size and length all resulted in potent inhibitors (19­26) with IC50 values ranging from 2 to 34 nM. The 8-position is very close to the protein backbone in the active site and was not considered to be an ideal site for the SAR study. Compound 27 with a hydroxy group in that position was a much weaker inhibitor with an IC50 value of 671 nM as anticipated.

Interestingly, substitutions at both the 6- and 7-positions appeared to have some additive effect. As shown in Table 3, a methoxy group at the 7-position coupled with a solubilizing group at the 6-position led to compounds with IC50 values mostly less than 1 nM (33­ 42). For the most potent compounds, 33, 36, and 40, the IC50 values were in the range of 0.2­0.3 nM, which represents at least a 10-fold improvement over most of the mono-substituted inhibitors. While both 6- and 7positions are solvent exposed, the 7-position is closer to the protein. The 7-OMe group can bind to the enzyme by making van der Waals contact within a small hydrophobic pocket formed by the side-chain of Tyr86 and the methylene of Gly90. We speculate that the presence of the 6-substitution may limit the 7-OMe group to be conformationally organized into the requisite binding orientation and resulted in inhibitors with superior potency. Potent inhibitors in the enzymatic assay were further evaluated in a functional and a mechanism-based cellular assay.11 The functional assay was a cell proliferation assay (MTS assay) in HeLa cells. In this assay, the antiproliferation effect was measured in the form of EC50 values for a CHK-1 inhibitor as a single agent and also

for an inhibitor in the presence of doxorubicin (150 nM), a DNA-damaging agent. For the combination study, the base line of the regression for EC50 calculation was adjusted to the inhibition level determined for 150 nM doxrubicin alone, a concentration known to cause G2/M arrest in HeLa cells. The ratio of the two corresponding EC50s (combo/single) represents a relative potentiation scale of a CHK-1 inhibitor to sensitize doxorubicin. The mechanism for the anti-proliferative function of the inhibitors was examined by a cell cycle analysis (FACS assay) in H1299 cells. The EC50 values were measured for an inhibitor alone and also for an inhibitor in combination with doxorubicin. The latter value indicates how effectively an inhibitor can reduce the doxorubicin-induced G2/M cell population. The cellular activity profiles for a group of potent CHK-1 inhibitors are summarized in Table 4 where compounds such as 7 and 36 represent the desirable profiles. These examples had no single agent activity (i.e., not cytotoxic) in either assay (EC50 > 22 lM in MTS, EC50 > 10 lM in

FACS). In combination with doxorubicin, however, they were able to potentiate the anti-proliferative effect of doxorubicin in the MTS assay by a large margin (92-fold for 7 and at least 47-fold for 36). Meantime, the results from the FACS assay confirmed that the observed potentiation effect was through abrogating G2/M cell arrest with combo-EC50 values at 1.3 and 0.61 lM for 7 and 36, respectively. Some compounds (9, 15, and 19) showed very weak anti-proliferative potentials, while others (6, 12, 23, 33, 40, and 41) displayed desirable doxorubicin sensitization but appeared to exhibit single agent cyto-toxicity (EC50 value between 0.62 and 2.8 lM in the MTS assay), an indication of certain off-target activities. The clinical implications of single agent activity remain unknown at this stage. It is noteworthy to mention that a lack of good correlation between the intrinsic enzymatic potency and the functional cellular potency was observed. In the literature,12 some CHK-1 inhibitors have shown diminished cellular activities due to their poor kinase selectivity profile. This

class of CHK-1 inhibitors, however, is generally selective against other Ser/Thr kinases as reported earlier.4 Low cellular activities of compounds with high inhibitory potency may reflect their improper physicochemical properties. Based on the above assay profiles, compounds 6, 7, and 36 were selected for PK evaluation in mice. As shown in Table 5, both mono-substituted compounds, 6 and 7, had high plasma clearance (CL), moderate-to-large volumes of distribution (Vd), and short half-lives. Both compounds exhibited moderate plasma exposure when dosed intraperitoneally with AUC values being 2.7 lg h/mL for 6 and 4.4 lg h/mL for 7. However, the oral bioavailability was poor for both. The bis-substituted compound 36 showed even higher clearance and volume of distribution while its oral bioavailability was reduced to an undetectable level. Noticeably, all three compounds are highly lipophilic with c log P (ACD) values ranging from 4.8 to 6.0. In an attempt to further evaluate other factors potentially associated with PK of these molecules, we investiTable 5.

gated the solubility, permeability, and metabolism properties of selected compounds. The solubilizing side-chains of 6 and 7 had only marginal impact on aqueous solubility at neutral pH. Both compounds possessed solubility less than 0.03 lg/mL. Although the inadequate water solubility may not be the only reason for the poor oral bioavailability, we made an effort to improve solubility via disrupting the planarity of the tricyclic pyrazole core by preparing the C4 gem-dimethylated compound 48 (Scheme 3). It was observed that this change of geometry did bring a 10-fold boost in aqueous solubility after a direct comparison between the two compounds having similar side-chains as 36/48 (data not shown). Unfortunately, the addition of the gem-dimethyl moiety resulted in less enzymatic activity of the inhibitor (IC50 = 0.24 nM for 36, 18 nM for 48), but more importantly, also diminished the cellular anti-proliferative activity of the compound (comboEC50 in MTS assay more than 5.9 lM as compared to 0.89 lM for 36, Table 4). The in vitro whole-cell permeability of 7 was assessed via a Caco-2 assay. The apparent permeability (apical to basal) is 13.3 · 10À6 cm/s (Table 6), suggesting that the molecule should have moderate absorption.13 In the presence of rat liver microsomes, compound 7 showed a half-life of 25 min (Table 6). Major routes of hepatic metabolism included oxidation of the tricyclic/ biphenyl rings (data not shown). As reported earlier,14 the metabolic stability of compounds containing phenol can be enhanced by installing electron-withdrawing groups next to the phenolic hydroxyl group to reduce glucuronidation (phase II metabolism). In addition, this strategy also has the potential to reduce the oxidative metabolism (phase I metabolism) on the aromatic rings due to reduced electron density. To this end, compounds

with fluoro and cyano groups ortho to the phenolic hydroxyl group were prepared (49­52, Scheme 4). The data in Table 5 revealed that, compared to the parent molecules (7 and 6), compounds with the fluoro substitution (49 and 51) maintained the enzymatic inhibition level but the overall PK parameters were generally the same, if not worse. The cyano group, however, was not tolerated in the binding pocket since the resulting compounds (50 and 52) lost their inhibitory activity. It is speculated that the combination of poor aqueous solubility and high lipophilicity of the molecules has led to the poor PK profiles. The high lipophilicity may have additionally contributed to the high clearance rate. In summary, we have systematically studied the substitution patterns on the phenyl ring of the tricyclic core. The substitutions at the 6- or 7-position were more tolerated than positions 5 and 8. The 5-position could only accommodate smaller groups, while even minor substitution at the 8-position led to significant potency loss. Bis-substitution at both the 6- and 7-positions generally led to compounds with higher enzymatic potency (IC50 value mostly below 1 nM), while the most potent compounds (33, 36, and 40) exhibited IC50 values between 0.2 and 0.3 nM. The best compound, 36, was able to potentiate the anti-proliferative effect of doxorubicin in the MTS assay by at least 47-fold. Its mechanism of action was through the abrogation of the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase based on the FACS analysis. PK studies in mice revealed that this class of CHK-1 inhibitors had high clearance, moderate bioavailability when dosed intraperitoneally, but poor oral bioavailability. Attempts have been made to analyze the causes for the inadequate PK profiles and specific compounds were synthesized accordingly. While the strategy to improve solubility via disruption of planarity was successful, weaker cellular potency prevented advancement of these analogs. Substituting electron-withdrawing groups such as fluoro next to the phenolic hydroxyl group to potentially alleviate metabolism did not help to improve the PK. It is likely that the combination of low aqueous solubility and high lipophilicity was the primary culprit for the deficient oral bioavailability. In order to address these issues, our future work will call for more dramatic changes to the structure of the molecules including identifying new moieties to replace the lipophilic bi-aryl phenol, while maintaining hydrogen bond interactions with the polar region of the kinase active site necessary for the high potency.

The reaction mixture contained 25 mM of HEPES at pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.08 mM Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 lM ATP, 4 nM 33 P ATP, 5 lM Cdc25C peptide substrate, and 5 nM of the recombinant CHK-1 protein. For potent compound with Ki below 1 nM, 0.5 nM of the recombinant CHK-1 protein and 8 nM of 33P were used. The concentration of the vehicle, DMSO, in the final reaction is 2%. After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of equal volume of 4 M NaCl and 0.1 M EDTA (pH 8.0). A 40 lL aliquot of the reaction mixture was added to a well in a Flash Plate (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) containing 160 lL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium chloride and magnesium chloride and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The plate was then washed three times in PBS with 0.05% of Tween 20 and counted in a Packard TopCount counter (Packard BioScience Company, Meriden, CT).
