Two substituted ureas of b-D-glucose, N-acetyl-N¢-b-D-glucopyranosyl urea (Acurea) and N-benzoyl-N¢-b-D-glucopyranosyl urea (Bzurea), have been identified as inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase, a potential target for therapeutic intervention in type 2 diabetes. To elucidate the structural basis of inhibition, we determined the structure of muscle glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb) complexed with the two ° ° compounds at 2.0 A and 1.8 A resolution, respectively. The structure of the GPb­Acurea complex reveals that the inhibitor can be accommodated in the catalytic site of T-state GPb with very little change in the tertiary structure. The glucopyranose moiety makes the standard hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts as observed in the GPb­glucose complex, while the acetyl urea moiety is in a favourable Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) has been exploited as a potential target for inhibitors that might prevent glycogenolysis under high glucose conditions in type 2 diabetes. Several binding sites have been identified as specific targets for inhibitor binding, and in some cases detailed X-ray crystallographic studies have elucidated key interactions responsible for inhibitor potency and have revealed the structural mechanisms of enzyme inhibition [1­9]. More specifically, the catalytic site has been probed with glucose and glucose analogue inhibitors, designed on the basis of information derived from the crystal structure of T-state glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb) [1­6]. The common kinetic and structural features of these compounds is that

electrostatic environment and makes additional polar contacts with the protein. The structure of the GPb­Bzurea complex shows that Bzurea binds tightly at the catalytic site and induces substantial conformational changes in the vicinity of the catalytic site. In particular, the loop of the polypeptide chain containing residues 282­287 shifts ° 1.3­3.7 A (Ca atoms) to accommodate Bzurea. Bzurea can ° also occupy the new allosteric site, some 33 A from the catalytic site, which is currently the target for the design of antidiabetic drugs.

they are highly selective for GPb, they are competitive inhibitors with respect to the substrate Glc1-P, and they bind at the catalytic site by stabilizing the 280s loop (residues 282­287). In the T-state enzyme (less active), this loop partly blocks access from the surface to the buried catalytic site [10]. On transition from T state to R state (active), the 280s loop becomes disrupted and displaced, thus opening up a channel that allows substrate (glycogen) access to the catalytic site [11­16]. In the nonregulatory maltodextrin phosphorylase (MalP), the 280s loop is held permanently in an open conformation [17,18], allowing access to the catalytic site and creation of a constitutively active enzyme. One of the early successes in the design of glucose-like compounds was the design and synthesis of N-acetylb-D-glucopyranosylamine (1-GlcNAc), which exhibited a Ki value of 32 lM,  60 times better than glucose (Ki ¼ 1.7 mM) and also achieved the desired effects in modulating GP activity in hepatic cells [19,20]. The amide made a strong hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl O of His377, a group for which the hydrogen-bonding capacity was otherwise unsatisfied, and the methyl group displaced two water molecules [4,5]. After crystallographic analysis of the 1-GlcNAc, a series of b-D-glucopyranosylamines were synthesized and studied in kinetic and crystallographic experiments [5], but none of them resulted in improved Ki values compared with 1-GlcNAc. The lead to

the best glucose analogue inhibitor of GPb came from (+)-hydantocidin, a ribofuranosylidene-spiro-hydantoin; the corresponding glucopyranose derivative exhibited a Ki value of 3.1 lM, more than 500 times lower than the corresponding Ki for glucose. The compound utilized the same hydrogen bond to the CO of His377 as in 1-GlcNAc and made additional hydrogen bonds from its own CO group [3,6]. The analogous glucopyranosylidene-spirothiohydantoin, which can be produced in gram amounts, was recently shown to have a similar potency on GPb in the direction of glycogen breakdown (Ki ¼ 5.1 lM) and an analogous mode of binding to GPb [21­23]. Because of its potential application to the control of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, the study of GP inhibition is a continuing challenge for physiology, synthetic, and medicinal chemistry, and also protein crystallography [8,9,24­26]. We report here on the kinetic

and crystallographic studies of two new glucose derivatives, N-acetyl-N¢-b-D-glucopyranosyl urea (Acurea) and N-benzoyl-N¢-b-D-glucopyranosyl urea (Bzurea). Both of these compounds bind at the catalytic site. In addition, Bzurea can also occupy the so-called new allosteric inhibitor site. This compound is the first glucose analogue to show affinity for this site.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Rabbit GPb was isolated, purified, recrystallised four times, and assayed as described [7,8]. Glucose-1-P (dipotassium salt), AMP (oyster) glycogen, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company. Glycogen was freed of AMP by the method of Helmreich & Cori [27]. Phosphoglucomutase and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH. Native T-state tetragonal (P43212) GPb crystals were grown as previously described [28] without IMP. Before data collection, crystals were mounted in thin-walled glass capillaries and soaked with (a) 100 mM Acurea (3 h), (b) 100 mM Bzurea (1.5 h), and (c) 10 mM Bzurea (3.5 h) in a buffered solution (10 mM Bes, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 6.7). Data for GPb­Acurea complex were collected on the beamline X-31 at Hamburg ° ° (k ¼ 1.05 A), at a maximum resolution of 1.97 A. Data for the 100 mM Bzurea soak were collected on Station 9.6 at ° Daresbury Laboratory at a resolution of 1.80 A ° (k ¼ 0.87 A). Data for the 10 mM Bzurea soak were ° collected at a resolution of 2.26 A on an Image Plate RAXIS IV mounted on a Rigaku Ru-H3RHB generator ° with a belt drive rotating anode (k ¼ 1.5418 A). Crystal orientation and integration of reflections were performed using DENZO [29]. Inter-frame scaling, partial reflection summation, data reduction and postrefinement were all completed using SCALEPACK [29]. Crystallographic refinement, with either XPLOR 3.8 or CNS 1.0 using positional and individual B-factor refinement with bulk-solvent correction [30,31], structural analysis and comparisons were performed as previously described [7,8]. Models of Acurea and Bzurea, generated using the program SYBYL (Tripos Associates Inc., St Louis, MO, USA) were fitted to the electron-density maps after torsion angles of the computed models had been adjusted. For the bound Acurea, two possible conformations that differed by 180° in the torsion angle about N2­C8 were explored in the refinement. Both gave similar crystallographic R values and similar temperature factors

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The new compounds studied in this work (Scheme 1) and their kinetic parameters (Ki) are summarized in Table 1. Crystallographic data collection, processing and refinement statistics for the structure determinations are shown in Table 2. The overall architecture of the native T-state GPb with the location of the catalytic allosteric effector and the new allosteric inhibitor site is presented in Fig. 1. Electrondensity maps clearly defined the position of the inhibitors at the catalytic site (Fig. 2A,B), consistent with the kinetic results. Additional density at the new allosteric inhibitor site

Fig. 1. A schematic diagram of the GPb dimeric molecule viewed down the twofold. The positions are shown for the catalytic, allosteric, and the new allosteric inhibitor site. The catalytic site, marked by Bzurea (shown in red), is buried at the centre of the subunit accessible to the ° bulk solvent through a 15-A-long channel. By binding at this site, Bzurea promotes the less active T state through rearrangement and stabilization of the closed position of the 280s loop (shown in white and green). The allosteric site, which binds the allosteric activator AMP (shown in magenta), is situated at the subunit­subunit interface, where the C-termini of the helices a2 (residues 47­78) and a8 (residues 289­314) come together, and it is closed by the cap¢ region (residues 36¢ ° to 47¢) from the symmetry-related subunit; it is some 30 A from the catalytic site. The new allosteric inhibitor site, located inside the central cavity formed on association of the two subunits, is closed at one end by residues from the cap and a2 helices and at the other end by the tower helices (residues 262­276) and the symmetry-related residues; it ° binds another Bzurea molecule (shown in orange) and is some 15 A ° ° from the allosteric effector site, 33 A from the catalytic site, and 37 A from the inhibitor site.

Asn284 ND2. There is also a possible intramolecular hydrogen bond from N2 to O8 as suggested by the program HBPLUS [34]. One water molecule (Wat10 in the native structure) was displaced by the methyl group (C9), in addition to those displaced by the glucopyranose (Wat284, Wat297). Acurea, on binding to GPb, makes a total of 16 hydrogen bonds and 83 van der Waals interactions (five nonpolar/nonpolar, 19 polar/polar, and 59 polar/nonpolar) (Tables 3 and 4). The hydrogen bonds formed between the ligand and the protein are illustrated in Fig. 3A. The structural results show that Acurea can be accommodated at the catalytic site with essentially no disturbance of the structure (Fig. 4A). The rmsd between the structures of native GPb and the GPb­Acurea complex for welldefined regions (18­249, 262­312, 326­829) are 0.124, 0.134 ° and 0.287 A for Ca, main-chain and side-chain atoms, respectively. By making a hydrogen bond to Asn284 and Asp283 via a water molecule and several van der Waals contacts to Asp283 OD1, Asn284 CG, OD1, and ND2 (through its O8, N2, O7, C7, and C8 atoms) Acurea stabilizes the geometry of the 280s loop. There are no changes at the allosteric effector site, the new allosteric site, the inhibitor site, or the tower/tower subunit interface. The Acurea was found to have a Ki value of 370 lM (Table 1), indicating that it is 10 times weaker as an inhibitor than N-acetyl-b-D-glucopyranosylamine (Ki ¼ 32 lM). The bound Acurea adopts a rather unfavourable conformation, formed by the intermolecular contact between its ° N1 and O8 (2.5 A). Straightforward energy minimization of Acurea using the program SYBYL (with the Powell minimizer and default parameters) resulted in an extended conformation, different from the bound structure. In the bound Acurea structure, the torsion angle O7-C7-N2-C8 is 178.5°, so that the conformation about the C7­N2 bond is significantly different from that in the computed structure (0.2°) of Acurea. Although there may be some favourable energy from the release of one water molecule, the increase in conformational energy of the ligand appears to be the reason for its low binding energy. Binding of Bzurea Catalytic site. Bzurea binds at the catalytic site with the urea and benzoyl moieties filling the empty space of the socalled b-pocket, a side channel from the catalytic site that leads toward residue His341, but with no access to the bulk solvent [1,35]. There are in total 21 hydrogen bonds and 96 van der Waals interactions (seven nonpolar/nonpolar, 16 polar/polar, and 73 polar/nonpolar) in the GPb­Bzurea complex. There is no hydrogen bond between the amide N1 and His377 O in the Bzurea complex as in the case of the Acurea complex. N1 and N2 are hydrogen-bonded to Asp339 OD1 through two water molecules, Wat200, and Wat251 which is also hydrogen-bonded to His341 NE2 of the b-pocket (Fig. 3B). The carbonyl O7 contacts Leu136N and Gly135N and Arg569N through Wat47, and there are also water-mediated (Wat242) contacts to Gly134N and carboxyl OD1 and OD2 of Asp283, which undergoes conformational change. There are negligible changes in the overall conformation on binding Bzurea to GPb, but there is a dramatic shift in the 280s loop with concomitant changes in the adjacent imidazole of His571, and some differences in the water

indicated binding of Bzurea (Fig. 2C) but not Acurea. We describe briefly the GPb­Acurea interactions at the catalytic site and in more detail the GPb­Bzurea interactions at both sites. Binding of Acurea As expected, the mode of binding of Acurea to GPb is similar to those of 1-GlcNAc, N-benzoyloxycarbonyl-b-Dglucopyranosylamine, and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-b-D-glucopyranosylamine derivatives (Table 1), but not identical. There is a hydrogen bond between the amide N atom and His377 O in the latter three analogues. In the GPb­Acurea complex, this hydrogen bond is not maintained; in the complex with Acurea, N1 is just too far away from the main° chain O of His377 (3.9 A). However, both the carbonyl O7 and N2 contact Asp283 OD1 through a water molecule (Wat52). In addition O7 forms a hydrogen bond with the Leu136 N, and carbonyl O8 is hydrogen-bonded to the

structure at the catalytic site. The superimposition of the structures of the native T state GPb and the GPb­Bzurea complex over well-defined residues (18­249, 262­312, 326­ ° 829) gave rmsd of 0.253, 0.259 and 0.656 A for Ca, mainchain and side-chain atoms, respectively, indicating that the two structures have very similar conformations. The major shifts between GPb­Bzurea and native GPb for main-chain atoms are for the residues of the 280s loop, Asn282 (1.0­ ° ° ° 1.3 A), Asp283 (1.3­1.6 A), Asn284 (1.3­3.7 A), Phe285 ° ° ° (2.5­2.9 A), Phe286 (1.3­1.8 A), and Glu287 (1.4­4.1 A) in

order to optimize contacts with the ligand (Figs 3B and 4B). These conformational changes lead to increased contacts between the inhibitor and the protein. Carbonyl O8 forms a hydrogen bond to Asp283 OD1 and contacts Gly134N, Leu136N, Gly137N, and Glu88 OE2 through Wat138, while the benzoyl moiety exploits 24 van der Waals contacts in the b-pocket; these contacts are dominated by polar­ polar and polar­nonpolar contacts with Asn282 and Asp283. The phenyl and His341 rings are inclined  60° and there are also two nonpolar­nonpolar contacts between

them (Tables 5 and 6). The strong affinity (Ki ¼ 4.6 lM) of Bzurea for GPb can be interpreted in terms of its extensive interactions with the protein. In the native GPb structure, His571 is hydrogen-bonded to Asp283. In the GPb­Bzurea complex, His571 is rotated (v1)  20° so that ND1 and NE2 atoms are shifted 0.9 and ° 1.2 A, respectively, in order to make a hydrogen bond to the

new position of OD2 of Asp283. In the T state GPb, Phe285 is partially shielded by a van der Waals interaction with Tyr613, and the packing of these two aromatic groups gives rise to the nucleoside inhibitor site, a site that binds caffeine and a number of other fused ring compounds [8]. In the GPb­Bzurea complex, Asn284 is now sandwiched between the side chains of Tyr613 and Phe285 (Fig. 5B), resulting in destruction of the inhibitor site, by mimicking the T to R allosteric transition. In fact, the key transition between inactive T-state and active R-state GP involves movement and disruption of the 280s loop, which allows a crucial arginine, Arg569, to enter the catalytic site in place of Asp283, and which also opens up access for glycogen to the catalytic site. The shift and disruption of the 280s loop is associated with subsequent destruction of the inhibitor site and changes at the intersubunit contacts of the dimer which give rise to allosteric effects [15]. In the R-state GP, the 280s loop is not well ordered and its position has not been established definitively. In contrast, in the MalP the 280s loop is held in an open conformation through interactions with the tower residues [17,18]. This allows access to the catalytic site and creates a constitutively active enzyme. Arg569 is also in the correct position to bind the substrate phosphate. A further significant conformational change in MalP structure on binding oligosaccharide (e.g. maltopentaose) involves movement of the 380 s loop (residues 377­384), resulting in closure of the catalytic site and creation of the recognition site for oligosaccharide [36].

Fig. 3. Interactions between Acurea and GPb (A) and between Bzurea and GPb (B) in the vicinity of the catalytic site.

A structural comparison between GPb­Bzurea and GPb­ glucose complexes and GPb­Bzurea and MalP­G5 complexes in the vicinity of the catalytic site is shown in Fig. 5B. It is apparent that the shifts in the 280s loop in the Bzurea complex are not in the direction of the T to R allosteric transition. Bzurea binds at the catalytic site by causing substantial conformational changes to the 280s loop, but the inhibitor still favours the interior position of the 280s loop because it interacts with the 280s loop. Arg569 is still in place, while there are no changes at the subunit­subunit contacts on binding Bzurea to the catalytic site. The tower helices (residues 262­276) and the cap¢ (residues 36¢ to 47¢) a2 helix (residues 47­78) contacts in the N-terminal region of the molecule (Fig. 1) have the same positions as in the native T-state GPb. These observations indicate that Bzurea should be classified as a T-state inhibitor. On binding Bzurea to GPb, Wat244 and Wat252 were displaced because of the shift of the 280s loop, and Wat10 ° and Wat201 were shifted by 1.8 A. New water molecules, unique to the GPb­Bzurea complex structure were Wat44, Wat200, Wat242, Wat243, Wat250, Wat262 (in the position previously occupied by Asn284 OD1), and Wat268; these water molecules form important links between the ligand and the protein.

In Fig. 6, we compare the binding of 1-GlcNAc, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-b-D-glucopyranosylamine, N-benzoyl-bD-glucopyranosylamine, Acurea, and Bzurea within the catalytic site of GPb. The positions of the glucosyl components of each of the structures are similar, indicating that the glucosyl-recognition site does not change substantially. The largest difference in positions is in their N1 ° positions, a difference that reflects the presence (2.9 A in ° 1-GlcNAc, 3.0 A in N-benzyloxycarbonyl-b-D-glucopyran° osylamine, 3.2 A in N-benzoyl-b-D-glucopyranosylamine) ° ° or absence (3.9 A in Acurea and 4.2 A in Bzurea) of a hydrogen bond between N1 and the main-chain O of His377 in these derivatives. New allosteric inhibitor site. Bzurea, on binding to GPb, also occupies the new allosteric inhibitor site, the site that is almost buried in the central cavity of the enzyme. The new allosteric site, identified recently as a target for drug interactions [7,9], has been shown to bind a number of indole-2-carboxamide inhibitors. The conformation of the bound Bzurea is not identical with that described above for the catalytic site. In the bound Bzurea structure, the torsion angle O7-C7-N2-C8 is )179.3°, so that the conformation about the C7­N2 bond is in trans geometry, significantly

different from that in the catalytic site (0.2°) of Bzurea. In addition, the phenyl ring is coplanar to the urea moiety, whereas, at the catalytic site, the plane of the phenyl ring is inclined  30° to the plane of the urea moiety. Bzurea on binding at the new allosteric inhibitor site of GPb makes a total of nine hydrogen bonds and exploits 80 van der Waals interactions, 28 of which are interactions between nonpolar groups; in total, there are 21 contacts with the symmetry related subunit (Fig. 7, Tables 7 and 8). The benzoyl moiety exploits 43 van der Waals contacts (25 nonpolar­nonpolar), which are dominated by the substantial contacts (20) made to almost all atoms of Arg60. There is also a hydrogen bond from the carbonyl oxygen O8 to Arg60 NH1. The urea moiety is located between the side chains of Arg60 and Lys191 and exploits 14 van der Waals contacts with residues Arg60, Glu190, Lys191, and Thr38¢ (where the prime refers to residues from the symmetryrelated subunit). There is a hydrogen bond from N2 to the main-chain O of Glu190, and water-mediated hydrogen bonds from carbonyl O7 to residues Asn187, Glu190, and Ala192 (Table 5). The glucopyranose moiety makes 23 van der Waals contacts, 19 of which are with residues from the symmetry-related subunit. The glucopyranose and His57¢

rings are inclined  80°, and there are extensive contacts between them. There are hydrogen bonds from His57¢NE2 to both hydroxy groups O3 and O4 and a rather weak ° hydrogen bond (3.4 A) between hydroxyl O6 and Lys191NZ. In addition, hydroxyl groups O2 and O3 hydrogen-bond O3 and O2, respectively, of the glucopyranose from the symmetry-related bound Bzurea molecule. There is, however, only moderate complementarity of van der Waals contacts between nonpolar ligand and protein groups for this part of the molecule and there are no aromatic­aromatic, amino­aromatic and CH­p interactions that are characteristic of the tight binding of the 4-fluorobenzyl moiety of CP320626 [7]. The binding of Bzurea at the new allosteric inhibitor site of GPb does not promote extensive conformational changes except for small shifts in the atoms surrounding the inhibitor, similar to those observed on binding of CP320626 to GPb [7], i.e. of residues 60, 64, and 191, which undergo conformational changes to accommodate the ligand. The inhibitor, on forming the complex with GPb, becomes almost entirely buried at the new allosteric site. The solvent accessibilities of the free and bound Bzurea are

° ° ° 525 A2 and 77 A2, indicating that a surface area of 447 A2 becomes inaccessible to water and that Bzurea becomes 85% buried in the enzyme complex. Binding of the inhibitor is associated with both subunits; surface areas from the two ° subunits that are buried in the inhibitor are 280 A2 (1st ° 2 (2nd subunit). Both polar and nonposubunit) and 167 A lar groups are buried, but the greatest contribution comes ° from the nonpolar groups which contribute 306 A2 (84%) of the surface that becomes inaccessible. On the protein ° surface, a total of 162 A2 solvent-accessible surface area ° becomes inaccessible on binding Bzurea, of which 81 A2 (50%) is contributed by nonpolar groups. In the CP320626 (IC50 ¼ 334 nM) complex [7], in contrast, the corresponding ° ° areas buried by ligand and protein are 536 A2 and 283 A2. A structural comparison between the GPb­CP320626 complex and the GPb­Bzurea complex shows that the two proteins have very similar overall structures and do not differ significantly at the interfaces between monomers. The two structures superimpose quite well; the positions of the Ca, main-chain and side-chain atoms for residues 17­208, 212­249, 261­313, 326­549, and 558­830 deviate from their ° ° ° mean positions by 0.242 A, 0.248 A and 0.428 A, respectively, indicating no significant changes between the complex structures. Figure 8 shows details of the contacts made at the new allosteric inhibitor site for the T-state GPb­Bzurea complex and GPb-glucose­CP320626 complex. The two structures superimpose well and they closely resemble each other in the vicinity of the new allosteric site. In a crystallographic experiment with 10 mM Bzurea (3.5 h soak) (Table 2), electron-density maps suggested strong binding of Bzurea at the catalytic site, but partial occupancy of the new allosteric inhibitor site by the ligand. Despite the low occupancy of Bzurea, the density was sufficiently well resolved to indicate the conformation of the

(A) In the GPb­glucose complex, Phe285 from the 280s loop is stacked close to Tyr613, and, together with these two hydrophobic aromatic residues, form the inhibitor site, where caffeine (not shown) binds. (B) In the GPb­Bzurea complex, because of the substantial shift of the 280s loop, Asn284 occupies the space between Phe285 and Tyr613, thus destroying the inhibitor site. MalP and GPb have an overall 46% sequence similarity, and in the region of the catalytic site there is a 98% sequence identity [37]. In MalP the 280s loop is held in an open conformation and this allows access of G5 to the catalytic site. In contrast, in the GPb­Bzurea, the 280s loop is still in an inactive T-state conformation which blocks access to the catalytic site.

ligand. It seems therefore that the new allosteric site is not the primary binding site for Bzurea. In conclusion, this study provides high-resolution structures of GPb complexed with two substituted ureas of b-Dglucose, Acurea and Bzurea. There is a significant rearrangement of the 280s loop within the catalytic site on binding Bzurea, which is not seen in the interaction with Acurea. An additional significant feature of binding of the two ureas is the absence of a hydrogen bond to the mainchain O of His377, which is present in all substituted b-D-glucopyranosylamines studied so far. The present results indicate that Bzurea can also occupy the new allosteric inhibitor site, which is highly specific for indole-2carboxamide inhibitors [7,9], that is currently a target for the development of hypoglycaemic drugs [26]. These observations will be of value in the design of further potent and specific inhibitors of the enzyme.
