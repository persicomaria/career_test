Optimization of a tri-substituted N-pyridyl amide led to the discovery of a new class of potent N-pyrimidyl amide based p38a MAP kinase inhibitors. Initial SAR studies led to the identification of 5-dihydrofuran as an optimal hydrophobic group. Additional side chain modifications resulted in the introduction of hydrogen bond interactions. Through extensive SAR studies, analogs bearing free amino groups and alternatives to the parent (S)-a-methyl benzyl moiety were identified. These compounds exhibited improved cellular activities and maintained balance between p38a and CYP3A4 inhibition. Ó 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a serine­threonine protein kinase and one of the best characterized enzymes involved in the inflammatory process.1,2 Of the four isoforms (a, b, c, and d), p38a is the most studied and perhaps the most physiologically relevant kinase involved in inflammatory responses. p38a MAP kinase is activated in response to cellular stress, growth factors and cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). Once activated, p38a stimulates cytokine production through activation of additional kinases leading to phosphorylation of heat shock proteins and transcription factors. Since modulation of cytokines has shown clinical efficacy in treating inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis,3­5 inflammatory bowel disease,6 congestive heart failure7 and psoriasis,8 the ability of p38a to modulate cytokine production has led to its implication in inflammation-based pathologies.2,9­13 Driven by the central role of p38a in settings of inflammation, this enzyme has been an active target for drug discovery efforts over the past decade.14­18 Contributing to these efforts, we previously described initial studies focusing on a novel class of N-pyridyl amides (Fig. 1).19 Subsequent SAR studies involving incorporation of a (S)-amethyl benzyl moiety at the 2-position of the pyridine accompanied by additional structural modifications led to the discovery of compound 2.19 Later conversion of the pyridine to a pyrimidine resulted in identification of compound 3 ( Fig. 2) possessing

significant improvements in potency against p38a in both enzymatic and cell-based assays. Herein we describe our subsequent SAR activities focused on the pyrimidine scaffold. As illustrated in Figure 3, the proposed binding mode of the cisconformer of 3 in the ATP binding site of p38a MAP kinase involves a hydrogen bond between a pyrimidine nitrogen and the amide NH of Met-109. An additional hydrogen bond is noted between the

bridging NH and the Met-109 carbonyl. The naphthyl group occupies the Thr-106 hydrophobic pocket known to be responsible for p38a kinase specificity.23­25 The a-methyl benzyl moiety occupies an additional hydrophobic pocket. The model also identifies a distal hydrogen bonding formed between the amide carbonyl of 3 and the Lys-53 side chain. Based on this binding mode, we hypothesize that potency enhancements may be achieved through incorporation of additional hydrogen bonds with neighboring amino acids, such as Asp-112, Ser-154, Asp-168 and Tyr-35. The compounds of the present study were prepared as illustrated in Scheme 1. As shown, reaction of 2,4-dichlo-pyrimidine with ethylamine gave 2-chloro-4-ethylaminopyrimidine, 5. Deprotonation with NaH followed by quenching with various acid chlorides allowed development of the R1 SAR. Final treatment with (S)-amethyl benzyl amine via palladium catalysis gave the desired final products, compounds 7.26 The p38 activities for this series are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, compared to the 2-naphthyl analog, 3, compounds bearing bicyclic groups such as 5-dihydrobenzofuryl, 7a, and 5-indanyl, 7e, showed improved enzyme activity. In contrast, analogs incorporating groups such as 3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenyl, 7b, 7-dihydrobenzofuryl, 7d, 3-benzo-thienyl, 7g, N-methyl-3-indolyl, 7h, and 2-benzofuryl, 7i, were several fold less active. Regarding compound 7f, the fourfold loss in potency compared to 7e may be caused by steric effects due to a six-membered ring versus a fivemembered ring. Due to this hypothesis, a series of analogs bearing monocyclic groups at R1 was prepared. This hypothesis was validated through the observation that substituted phenyl groups were compatible with potent p38a inhibition. Of particular interest were meta-substituted compounds 7l, 7o, 7r, and 7t--all showing activity in the enzyme assay at approximately 80 nM or better. The two most

potent compounds (7u and 7v) were identified as the more metabolically stable analogs of 7o. In reconciling the enzyme inhibitory activity with the proposed binding mode in Figure 3, it appears that the hydrophobic pocket formed by Thr-106, Val-105, and Leu-104 can tolerate both polar and non-polar substituents. However, when polar groups reside in this pocket, activity is dependent upon the orientation of the group.

Also shown in Table 1, enzyme inhibitory activity did not necessarily track with cell-based data. While our most potent analogs bearing bicyclic groups at R1 inhibited at approximately 400­900 nM, our best monocyclic derivative, compound 7o, 7u, and 7v inhibited at 140 nM, 178 nM, and 58 nM, respectively. While these results showed promise, we felt that the benzofuran group of 7a was able to optimally fill its respective hydrophobic pocket. Consequently, this compound was chosen as a new baseline for additional SAR studies targeting the amide side chain. The compounds shown in Table 2 were prepared as illustrated in Scheme 1 by substituting ethylamine with alternative amines. In cases where final products contained free amino groups, these amines were incorporated into Scheme 1 as Boc derivatives. Boc cleavage was incorporated into the final step using standard TFA conditions.26 As shown in Table 2, modifications at R2 generally resulted in weaker inhibition compared to compound 7a. This observation was independent of the presence of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors. However, when R2 was modified to incorporate a chain of four carbons, both enzymatic and cell-based potency improved. In this series, the best analogs (compounds 8e and 8l) showed low nM activity in both assays. As illustrated in Figure 4, the improved enzymatic activity is explained through the introduction of hydrogen bonds with Ser-154 and the side chain of Asp-112. While the SAR thus far resulted in improvements in both enzymatic and cellular inhibition, the broader set of compounds studied, of which only a subset is presented herein, were consistently identified as potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. This CYP activity was traced to the (S)-a-methylbenzyl group. Thus, in order to proactively design structures with minimal potential for drug­drug interactions, structures bearing alternatives to this group were preTable 2 p38a enzyme and cellular activity for compounds 7a, 8a­n

with different amines.26 The parent structures for this SAR were compounds 8e and 8l. As shown in Table 3, replacing the (S)-a-methyl benzyl group impacted not only CYP3A4 activity, but also enzymatic and cellular activity. Of the modifications shown, only a 2-propyl alternative maintained p38a activity while reducing CYP3A4 activity by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the enzymatic activity. In the case of parent compound 8l, (S)-2-(1-methoxy)propyl was also well tolerated. In summary, high throughput screening identified N-pyridyl amides as novel inhibitors of p38a. Through subsequent SAR studies, both enzymatic and cellular activities were optimized (compounds 8e and 8l). Improved enzymatic activity is believed due to optimal occupation of hydrophobic pockets and introduction of additional hydrogen bonding interactions. Additional SAR produced structures with improved CYP profiles. These compounds (analogs 9a, 10a, and 10c) were targeted as candidates for further development. References and notes

CYP3A4 assay procedure: compounds were diluted from DMSO stocks to 40 lM in cofactors/serial dilution buffer (0.05 M potassium phosphate, 2 mg/mL NADP+, 2 mg/mL glucose-6-phosphate, 1.3 mg/mL magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.8 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), for example, 2 lL 10 mM stock into 500 lL = 40 lM in 0.4% DMSO. With a multichannel pipette 0.1 mL of cofactors/serial dilution buffer + 0.4% DMSO were dispensed into the wells in columns 2­12. The diluted test compounds (150 lL) or positive control were added to the desired well in column 1. With a multichannel pipette, 0.05 mL from the wells in column 1 was serially diluted to the wells in columns 2 through 8. The solution was mixed by pipetting 3­5 times in each well. The remaining 0.05 mL in the wells in column 8 was removed and discarded. A lid was placed on the plate and it was put at 37 °C in an incubator for at least 10 min. With a multichannel pipette, 0.1 mL enzyme/substrate mix (100 pmol CYP3A4+OR+b5 SupersomesTM, 50 mM 7benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin, 0.5 M potassium phosphate) was dispensed to columns 1 through 11. The liquid was dispensed in a stream to facilitate mixing. The lid was replaced and incubation continued at 37 °C for 30 min. With a miltichannel pipette, 0.075 mL of STOP solution (80% acetonitrile/20% 0.5 M tris base) was dispensed to all wells. Dispense the liquid in a stream to facilitate mixing. The enzyme/substrate mix (0.1 mL) was dispensed to the wells in column 12 and the plate was scanned with a fluorescent plate scanner (Perkin Elmer LS50B--excitation filter 409 nM, emission filter 530 nM).
