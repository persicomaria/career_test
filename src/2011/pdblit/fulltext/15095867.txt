Abstract Cyclic voltammetry studies of putidaredoxin reductase (PdR) were carried out on graphite working electrodes, with comparative scans of the co-factor FAD. STM observations were performed to investigate the adsorption of PdR at the surface of HOPG and gold(111) surfaces under aqueous (buffered) conditions. Images of single molecules of PdR were observed under both conditions. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The direct electrochemistry of redox proteins and enzymes is now well-established [1]. Though there are instances in which this can take place at unmodified surfaces, normally the surface of the electrode must be made `compatible' with that of the protein or enzyme. This was first [2] made possible by the use of what were then called `promoters' but are now `facilitators'. These compounds bind at the electrode surface but also contain residues that are capable of interacting with groups on the protein or enzyme. The first facilitators introduced, such as 4,4-bipyridyl, bound to the gold electrode and, simultaneously, to the positively-charged protein, such as cytochrome c. There soon followed [3] a feast of facilitators that bound to the electrode surface, e.g. gold, via sulphur-containing residues or to edgeplane graphite via positively-charged amines. A major step towards understanding the role of the promoters/ facilitators and the electron transfer reactions of cytochrome c was reported [4] in 1981 by Albery et al. They examined, using rotating ring disc electrodes, the dependence of the rate of reaction on the proportion

of the different redox forms and from this concluded that the true rate of electron transfer was fast, 50/100 s (1, quite different from the impression gained by examination of the heterogeneous rate constant: it is strange that this paper is relatively unreported. The monooxygenase, cytochrome P450cam, that catalyses [5] the oxidation of camphor by dioxygen to 5-exohydroxycamphor requires two reducing equivalents. These are originally derived from NADH, being transferred to P450cam via two redox-linked proteins, putidaredoxin reductase (PdR) and putidaredoxin (Pdx). The former is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)dependent reductase and the latter is an iron /sulphur protein. The electrochemistry [6] of P450cam and other P450s has been reported as has that of Pdx [7]. It has been shown [8] that electron transfer to P450cam is influenced by the formation of a complex between P450cam and Pdx though there has been some difficulty arranging for turnover conditions, i.e. the catalytic conversion of camphor to its 5-exo-hydroxycamphor. With the goal of supplying the reducing equivalents electrochemically, in a form of electroenzymology, we have investigated the electrochemistry of PdR though many workers consider [9] that it will be sufficient to reduce a complex of P450cam and Pdx. In attempts to determine the structure of electrode surfaces modified with P450cam and the complex formed between it and Pdx, we have reported [10,11] a scanning tunnelling

microscopy (STM) study of both proteins on gold(111) surfaces. Since its invention, now nearly two decades ago [12], STM has become [13] an essential tool for scientists working at the interface between various scientific disciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, physics, material science and environmental studies. The multidisciplinary application of STM lies in its ability to image samples under virtually all experimental conditions with high, even atomic, resolution. It is now possible [14] to observe the STM of proteins and enzymes in aqueous media in such a manner that they are still enzymatically active and can express their usual electrochemical properties, albeit those modified by adsorption on the electrode surface. Herein we report the electrochemical behaviour of PdR at a carbon/ graphite electrode and the STM of this protein at HOPG and gold(111) surfaces.

2. Experimental All buffer components, solvents and other reagents were of AnalaR grade or the highest purity available. All buffer solutions used in enzyme preparation were filtered through sterile 0.22 mm filters prior to use. PdR was expressed in Escherichia coli , and purified [15] according to literature methods. The purified protein was stored at (/20 8C in 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The storage solution contained 50% glycerol. Glycerol was removed immediately prior to experiments by gel filtration on a Pharmacia PD-10 column equilibrated with 15 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.2 (Aldrich 31-925-2). DC cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed at room temperature in a two-compartment glass cell with a working volume of 0.5 ml. The working compartment accommodated the platinum gauze counter electrode in addition to the edge plane pyrolytic graphite working electrode (prepared `in-house'). A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference in a sidearm that connected to the working compartment via a Luggin capillary. All potentials are referred to the SCE. An Autolab PGSTAT20 potentiostat (Eco Chemie B.V.) was used to record and control the potential of the working electrode. All electrochemistry measurements were made in 15 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.2 (Aldrich 31-925-2), and the protein concentrations were kept constant at 14.7 mM. Before each experiment, or set of experiments, the electrodes were washed with water, polished by hand using a water and aluminium oxide (0.015 mm, BDH) slurry on a polishing cloth, then sonicated briefly to remove the adhering alumina and finally rinsed with water. Solutions of FAD (Sigma F-6625) and neomycin

sulphate (Sigma, N-1876) were prepared in the potassium phosphate buffer. Electrochemical experiments on gold surfaces were carried out using `in-house' prepared polycrystalline gold electrodes. The 5 mm diameter surfaces were thoroughly cleaned prior to all experiments using the following protocol: the electrode was polished with a 0.3 mm alumina slurry (BDJ), sonicated in 18.2 MV grade deionised water (Millipore), then electrochemically cleaned by cycling in 2.0 M H2SO4 (99.9% grade, Aldrich). STM experiments were performed on a Molecular Imaging Pico STM instrument (Model MS300) with a `D' scanner (Molecular Imaging). Vibration isolation was provided by a bungee system enclosed in an environmental chamber. Gold substrates were prepared by evaporating gold (Goodfellow Ltd.) on freshly cleaved muscovite mica (Agar Scientific) at 250 8C under a pressure of 0.1 N m (2 and deposited at the rate 0.2 nm s (1. Substrates were annealed in a blue butane flame, quenched in air for a few seconds and then immersed in pure water. Tips were prepared by electrochemical etching of a tungsten wire (0.25 mm, Agar Scientific) in 3 M NaOH and coated in apiezon wax (Aldrich 27-072-3) and immersed in 15 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (Aldrich 31-925-2) within the Molecular Imaging fluid cell. The fluid cell was soaked overnight in a mixture of 30% H2O2 and 70% H2SO4 (caution!), then immersed in boiling Millipore water for at least 1 h prior to use. For ambient imaging, a freshly annealed gold electrode was immersed in a 0.3 mM enzyme solution in deionised water for 10/30 min, gently rinsed, blown dry with a jet of pure argon gas and immediately imaged under conditions of high tunnelling resistance. Solution phase imaging was carried out in the same way, with the exception that the gold substrate was removed from the enzyme solution, then immediately immersed in buffer (15 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (Aldrich 31-925-2)) within the fluid cell. Fluid STM work on HOPG was done in situ, where a freshly cleaved HOPG surface was exposed to the enzyme solution with simultaneous scanning. All STM experiments were done in a temperaturecontrolled room at T 0/209/1 8C. All images were subject to a low pass filtering, and were processed using Scanning Probe Image Processor SPIP (Image Metrology ApS).

view of single molecules of the protein on HOPG in (a(ii), a(iii)), as well STM images on gold(111) in air (b) and fluid (c(i), c(ii), c(iii)). STM images were reproducible in this case and constitute the first STM images of individual PdR molecules on gold and HOPG.

4. Discussion In our attempts to define the nature of the surface of electrodes used in the study of the electrochemistry of proteins and enzymes, we have chosen Scanning Probe Microscopy, of which STM is of particular value, as a method of defining the state of the proteins. We have previously [10] used the STM of genetic hybrids of proteins to ensure that they bound essentially irreversibly to the surface. For example, the use of a variant of cytochrome P450cam that had a single cysteine on the surface, allowed the images of that protein to be readily obtained. At the moment, no such variant of PdR is available, therefore, we explored its adsorption on gold and graphite surfaces and similarly its corresponding electrochemistry. Whereas both methods of investigation were productive at graphitic surfaces, high resolution STM images could be more easily obtained on gold than on HOPG it is crucial to point out that the affinity of proteins for gold is much higher that that of nonoxidised HOPG: the surface of the latter is highly hydrophobic in its `native' state and thus not generally open to (non-destructive) surface interactions with biomolecules. The surface chemistry of the carbon can be altered by a number of chemical and physical processes. These treatments fix a certain amount of oxygen surface complexes such as carboxyls, lactones, phenols, ketones, quinones, alcohols and ethers that yield a more hydrophilic carbon surface. In this study we utilised electrochemical treatment, where a potential of 1.4 V (vs. silver reference) was held over HOPG for 3 min in phosphate buffer. STM topography of oxidised graphite shows a wavy structure, different from pure graphite at atomic level, rationalised by the presence of the oxygen functionalities on the surface [16]. However, the STM of the protein adsorbed on HOPG and the electrochemistry were consistent with that expected for a protein of its size. Whereas the electrochemistry was readily obtained using EPG as electrode, because of its exceedingly irregular surface, it is, unfortunately, not appropriate for STM investigations at the high resolution necessary to reveal molecular details. At gold, the situation is quite different: in this case, although images of good quality are obtained at gold(111), the electrochemical investigations were disappointing in that no reproducible data could be obtained. It is likely that the adsorption of the protein on the gold was such as to render electron transfer between the redox site and the electrode too slow to

expected from an adsorbed species as shown by the linearity of the current on the scan rate, Fig. 1. Although the potential of free FAD itself is not very different */ the midpoint of the FAD couple is (/472.5 mV compared with (/527 mV for PdR */the former shows the expected linear dependence on the square root of the scan rate whereas PdR exhibits linear dependence on the scan rate. The cyclic voltammetry at EPG is much better defined in the presence of neomycin, a commonly used facilitator [15], and PdR is still adsorbed onto the electrode surface. In contrast with the electrochemistry at these graphitic electrodes, that at gold is essentially non-existent. Occasionally, some slight response was observed with PdR but even the usual facilitators were not effective in producing well-behaved electrochemistry. 3.2. Scanning tunnelling microscopy The contrast with the results obtained from the electrochemical measurements was marked: although good images were obtained from the STM of PdR on an HOPG surface, those obtained at a gold(111) surface were very good, as good as those obtained from cytochrome P450 or Pdx [11], the partner proteins of PdR in this electron transfer process. Fig. 2 shows fluid STM data of PdR on a HOPG surface (Fig. 2a(i)), a

allow observation. For example, if the adsorption mainly occurred in such a manner that the redox site was disposed towards the solution and correspondingly far from the electrode surface, that could result in very slow electron transfer and correspondingly no cyclic voltammetric results would be forthcoming. A facilitator for electron transfer may eventually be obtained. It is important to notice, by looking at the images in Fig. 2, that there is more than one orientation with

which PdR molecules adsorb on to the electrode surface, with the most frequently observed orientation (ca. 30%) appearing to have a `tear-drop' shape (Fig. 2b). Without further detailed study, and resolved crystal structure of PdR, it is difficult to explain the reason(s) behind this observation. With reference to the amino acid sequence, there are six cysteine residues in PdR. The known strong interaction between a cysteine residue and a gold electrode surface is a possible explanation as to this

protein's mechanism of binding to the gold electrode surface. Interestingly, tunnelling images obtained under ambient conditions gave molecular dimensions of, on average, 6 /6.5 )/8 /9 nm, whilst fluid phase imaging produced dimensions closer to 4/5 )/5 /6 nm in both cases for gold and HOPG. There are no NMR or crystallographic data available for PdR with which to compare our STM results with respect to the overall shape or size of PdR molecules. Since these observations were fairly reproducible, it is unlikely that different degrees of tip convolution are responsible. It has been reported that under typical ambient STM conditions much, if not all, of the tunnel current is carried by a thin film of water present on the surface of the biomolecule [17 /19]. In this study, we have gained images of single molecules of PdR on gold(111) and HOPG that are consistent with that expected for a protein of its size. Eventually, it may be possible to fashion an electrode surface that permits electron transfer to PdR, Pdx and cytochrome P450 which may aid the development of electrochemical sensors based on the versatility of the latter enzyme.
