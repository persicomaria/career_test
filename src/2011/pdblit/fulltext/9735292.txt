The Type I isozyme of mammalian hexokinase has evolved by a gene duplication­fusion mechanism, with resulting internal duplication of sequence and ligand binding sites. However, 1:1 binding stoichiometry indicates that only one of these is available for binding the product inhibitor, Glc-6-P; the location of that site, in the N- or C-terminal half, remains under debate. Recent structural studies (Aleshin et al., Structure 6, 39 ­50, 1998; Mulichak et al., Nature Struct. Biol. 5, 555­560, 1998) implicated Asp 84 or its analog in the C-terminal half, Asp 532, in binding of Glc-6-P. Zeng et al. (Biochemistry 35, 13157­13164, 1996) demonstrated that mutation of Asp 532 to Lys or Glu did not affect inhibition by the Glc-6-P analog, 1,5-anhydroglucitol6-P. These same mutations, as well as mutation to Ala, at the Asp 84 position are now shown to result in increased K i for 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-P. The ability of P i to antagonize inhibition by the Glc-6-P analog is severely diminished or abolished by these mutations, suggesting that antagonism is dependent on precise positioning of the inhibitory hexose 6-phosphate. The structure of the enzyme complexed with Glc and P i has been determined, and shows that P i occupies the same site as the 6-phosphate group in the complex with Glc-6-P. Thus, antagonism between these ligands results from competition for a common anion binding site in the N-terminal half. © 1999 Academic Press Key Words: hexokinase, Type I isozyme, inhibition by Glc-6-P; hexokinase, Type I isozyme, binding of P i; hexokinase, Type I isozyme, structure of.

The Type I, Type II, and Type III isozymes of mammalian hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) have molecular weights of approximately 100,000 and are susceptible to inhibition by physiologically relevant levels of the product, Glc-6-P. These isozymes apparently evolved by duplication and fusion of a gene encoding an ancestral Glc-6-P-sensitive hexokinase with molecular mass of 50 kDa (1). Thus, the 100-kDa isozymes consist of N- and C-terminal halves that show extensive sequence similarity, to each other and to 50-kDa hexokinases found in other organisms. The ancestral 100-kDa enzyme resulting from such an evolutionary scenario would therefore consist of N- and C-terminal halves, each with catalytic activity inhibitable by Glc-6-P. The Type II isozyme has retained this functional organization (2, 3). In contrast, further functional differentiation has occurred with the Type I and Type III isozymes, with catalytic activity retained in the C-terminal halves, while the N-terminal halves have evolved to take on regulatory function (1, 4 ­11). The Type I isozyme binds, with high affinity, only one Glc-6-P and one Glc molecule per 100,000 mol. wt. hexokinase molecule (12­14). Furthermore, a high-affinity site for Glc-6-P was found in the N-terminal half (15), while catalytic function was associated with the C-terminal half (4). It was logical, then, to conclude that the binding sites for Glc-6-P and Glc resided in the N- and C-terminal halves, respectively, with conformational changes induced by binding of Glc-6-P to the N-terminal site, leading to inhibition of catalytic function in the C-terminal half. However, the situation became complicated by the demonstration that each half, when isolated by limited proteolysis (4, 15) or expressed from the truncated cDNAs (7, 8, 10), could bind both Glc and Glc-6-P; thus, two potential sites for

FIG. 1. "Extended" conformation of the monomer of Type I hexokinase. The dimeric form of Type I hexokinase, characterized in X-ray crystallographic studies (16, 18), consists of two such monomers, oriented in antiparallel fashion. The structures of the N- and C-terminal halves are virtually identical and, within a single monomer, interactions between the two halves are extremely limited. Figures 1 and 2 were prepared with SETOR (20).

each ligand exist in a 100,000 mol. wt. molecule. Moreover, the isolated catalytic C-terminal half retained sensitivity to inhibition by Glc-6-P that was indistinguishable from that of the intact enzyme, thus indicating the presence of a functional Glc-6-P site in both domains (4, 15). In an attempt to reconcile these observations, White and Wilson (4, 5) suggested that, in the intact enzyme, the Glc binding site in the N-terminal half and the Glc-6-P binding site in the C-terminal half are latent, presumably due to structural constraints present in the intact molecule. It was suggested that removal of these constraints by isolation of the discrete halves permits binding sites in both halves to be revealed. However, others (7, 8, 10, 16, 17) have favored the view that inhibition results from binding of Glc-6-P to a site in the C-terminal, while the Glc-6-P binding site in the N-terminal half (15) is presumed to be either nonfunctional or to have another still-undefined function. Whichever view is accepted, the observed 1:1 binding stoichiometry (12­14) demands that the two sites differ markedly in affinity, inhibition being associated with the site binding Glc-6-P with high affinity. The recent determination of structures for the human (16) and rat (18) Type I isozymes has provided a critical step toward resolution of this question. These structures reveal a dimeric form of the enzyme, favored at high protein concentrations (normally encountered during crystallization) and by the presence of Glc-6-P (19). The primary functional form of the Type I isozyme is, however, a monomer and the regulatory properties of this enzyme are dependent on intimate conformational interactions between the N- and C-terminal halves (1, 3­9, 11). In contrast, in the dimer (16, 18), contacts between the N- and C-terminal domains of a

single monomer are extremely limited (Fig. 1). It is therefore evident that understanding the structural relationship between the N- and C-terminal halves in the functional monomer, and thus the molecular basis for the interdomain interactions that result in inhibition of the enzyme or latency of binding sites, must await determination of the structure of the monomeric form. However, the dimeric structure does reveal the location of the Glc-6-P binding sites, found at equivalent positions in both N- and C-terminal halves, and establishes the stoichiometry of Glc-6-P and Glc binding to the dimeric form as two ligands bound per 100,000 mol. wt. monomer (16, 18). Hence, the "extended" form of the monomer, as it exists in the dimer, has abolished the latency of sites seen in the functional monomer. We now report site-directed mutation results supporting the view that the N-terminal Glc-6-P site is the functional regulatory site in rat Type I hexokinase. Furthermore, we show crystallographically that the binding site for P i, a ligand that can reverse inhibition by Glc-6-P, overlaps with that of Glc-6-P. This is consistent with the proposal (5, 6, 9) that the antagonism by P i results from competition with the 6-phosphate group of Glc-6-P for a common anion binding site in the N-terminal half of the enzyme. Aleshin et al. (21) have recently localized a phosphate binding site at the equivalent position in the N-terminal half of the human Type I isozyme.

FIG. 2. Stereo view of the Glc-6-P binding site in the N-terminal half of Type I hexokinase. The position of Glc-6-P is indicated, as are the positions of residues interacting with this ligand. Asp 84, of primary interest in the present study, is in position to interact via hydrogen bonding (dotted lines) with hydroxyls at positions 2 and 3 of the hexose ring, with oxygen­ oxygen distances of 3.0 and 2.7 Å, respectively. Glc-6-P is also found at an analogous site in the C-terminal half of the molecule (16, 18), with Asp 532 corresponding to Asp 84 of the N-terminal site. The difference electron density map calculated for the hexokinase/Glc/P i complex is superimposed. The highest peak, shown at the 3.5 contour level, is coincident with the 6-phosphate moiety of Glc-6-P, clearly indicating that P i occupies this same site.

solely to that encoded by the plasmid used in the transfection (11), simplifying kinetic studies. Cells were grown and transfected (4 g plasmid DNA per 100-mm culture dish) as described previously (11), except that LipofectAMINE Plus was used in place of LipofectAMINE as transfection reagent. Extracts were prepared 48 ­72 h after transfection, using the procedure described earlier (11) with slight modification--after the freeze­thaw cycles, disruption of the cells was ensured by four or five passes of the lysate through a 23-gauge needle prior to centrifugation to yield the supernatant, which was used for further analysis. Plasmid constructs were obtained by standard methodologies used in earlier studies from this laboratory (3, 9, 11, 23). Wild-type and mutant cDNAs were cloned in the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), in which expression is driven by the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Site-directed mutations were made using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); all mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of the mutant DNAs. For reasons discussed below, mutations were made at position 84, changing the wild-type Asp residue to Ala, Lys, or Glu. Oligonucleotide pairs used to make these mutations were: for the D84A mutation, CGTGGCCGGTTCTCTCTA and AACCGGCCACGCCAACCG; for the D84E mutation, ATTGCCCTGGAACTCGGCGGG and CCCGCCGAGTTCCAGGGCAAT; and for the D84K mutation, ATTGCCCTGAAGCTCGGCGGG and CCCGCCGAGCTTCAGGGCAAT. The underlined nucleotides indicate the change leading to the desired mutation. Kinetic studies. Hexokinase activity was determined by spectrophotometric assay (24) in which Glc-6-P production is coupled to NADPH formation, monitored at 340 nm, in the presence of excess Glc-6-P dehydrogenase. Apparent K m values for ATP or Glc were determined with this same assay system by appropriate variation in concentration of ATP or Glc while maintaining the other substrate at the saturating level used in the standard assay (24). Inhibition by the Glc-6-P analog, 1-5-anhydroglucitol 6-phosphate (1,5-AnG-6-P), 3 which is competitive vs ATP (17, 25), was determined in this same system with appropriate variation in [ATP] and addition of 1,5-AnG3 Abbreviation used: 1,5-AnG-6-P, 1,5-anhydroglucitol 6-phosphate.

6-P (50 or 100 M). Inhibition by P i, which is also competitive vs ATP (14), was determined in a similar manner with variation in [ATP] and addition of 30 or 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.5. Kinetic data were analyzed using the EZ-Fit program of Perrella (26). Statistical analysis was done with the GraphPAD Instat program, V 1.13 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA). SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Extracts were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7.5% acrylamide­SDS gels, and immunoblotting was done as described previously (23) with monoclonal antibody 21 (9) as primary antibody. Quantitative analysis (23) of immunoblots was done using the GDS-2000 gel documentation system from UVP, Inc. (San Gabriel, CA). Selection of Asp 84 as the target residue. Because of the internal sequence similarity in Type I hexokinase, Asp 532 in the C-terminal half is analogous to Asp 84 in the N-terminal half of the molecule. Asp 532 has previously been shown to be critical for catalytic function (23, 27), possibly by stabilization of the transition state (27). Thus, mutation of Asp 532 to Asn (23) or to Glu or Lys (27) has a highly detrimental effect on catalytic activity. Recent structural determinations (16, 18) have led to recognition of an additional role for Asp 84 and its analog, Asp 532. The side chains of these residues are involved in binding of Glc-6-P, interacting with the hydroxyls at positions 2 and 3 of the hexose ring (Fig. 2). The classic study by Crane and Sols (28) had indicated the importance of the 2-hydroxyl group for binding of the hexose moiety at the inhibitor site, while the 2-hydroxyl position was not important for binding at the substrate hexose site, an observation that led these investigators to first propose the existence of discrete regulatory and substrate binding sites on the enzyme. Because of its catalytic importance, Zeng et al. (27) had examined the effects of mutation at Asp 532 on catalytic properties, but had also noted that the mutations, D532K and D532E, had no effect on inhibition by 1,5-AnG-6-P. Subsequent studies (16, 18) led to recognition of the role of Asp 532 in binding of Glc-6-P to the dimer. Aleshin et al. (16) noted that the lack of effect of the D532K and D532E mutations on inhibition was inconsistent with the C-terminal site being responsible for inhibition of the functional monomer, but nonetheless persisted in favoring the view that the C-terminal site was indeed the relevant site. The complement of the study by Zeng et al. (27) was obviously of critical importance. Thus, the present study

Type I hexokinase was purified from rat brain as previously described (24) and stored at 80°C in 20 mM Hepes, 10 mM Glc, 10 mM thioglycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. For crystallization of the ternary complex with Glc and inorganic phosphate, the protein solution was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Using vapor diffusion methods, crystals were grown at room temperature in 6% polyethylene glycol 20,000, 50 mM ammonium phosphate, 10 mM Glc, 100 mM imidazole, pH 7.0. The crystals are monoclinic (P2 1; a 124.4 Å, b 75.1 Å, c 126.8 Å, 107°) with two monomers per asymmetric unit and a calculated protein volume fraction of 43%. Crystals were transferred to a storing solution identical to the mother liquor but with 30% glycerol prior to flash-freezing by immersion in liquid propane. All X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at 120°C on a Rigaku R-Axis II image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 generator equipped with MSC focusing mirrors and were processed and scaled using R-Axis software. This structure is isomorphous with the previously determined (18) Type 1 crystal structure of the hexokinase/Glc/Glc-6-P complex and essentially isomorphous with the higher resolution Type 2 crystal form (Protein Data Bank Entry 1bg3). Thus, the structure determination of the hexokinase/Glc/P i complex was straightforward. The initial phasing model had an R-factor of 0.347. The structure was refined using X-PLOR (29), including data at 20 ­3.2 Å and applying noncrystallographic symmetry restraints between the two molecules of the asymmetric unit. Structure refinement is ongoing and the current structure has an R factor of 0.245 (R free 0.335) assuming an overall B factor of 25 Å 2. A complete description of the structure will be presented elsewhere (A. Mulichak et al., manuscript in preparation).

RESULTS

Expression of wild-type and mutant hexokinases in M R 42 cells. All mutants were expressed at levels comparable to, although somewhat more variable than, the wild-type enzyme (Table I). The specific activity of the D84A mutant enzyme was virtually identical to that of the wild-type enzyme, while the specific activities of the D84E and D84K mutants were somewhat

lower, although only the latter difference attained statistical significance (P 0.05). It is thus evident that the mutations at this N-terminal residue have, at most, modest effects on expression of the enzyme in M R 42 cells or on the catalytic activity (k cat) of the expressed proteins. The latter is, of course, expected since catalytic function is associated with the C-terminal half. Similar results have been reported previously (23) for expression of the D84N mutant in COS1 cells. Effect of mutations on kinetic parameters. Mutation of Asp 84 to Ala, Glu, or Lys had no effect on the apparent K m for ATP or Glc (Table II). In contrast, each of these mutations resulted in a highly significant increase in K i for inhibition by 1,5-AnG-6-P. Mutation to the homolog, Glu, resulted in a modest increase in K i, while the effects of the D84A or D84K mutations were somewhat greater. It has previously been reported (23) that mutation of Asp 84 to the isosteric Asn had no detectable effect on inhibition by 1,5-AnG-6-P. At low (mM) concentrations, P i antagonizes the inhibition by Glc-6-P or its analog, 1,5-AnG-6-P, while, at higher concentrations, P i itself becomes an inhibitor of the enzyme (4, 9, 13, 14). The antagonistic effect of P i has been associated with the N-terminal half of the molecule (5, 6, 9, 16, 21) and attributed to competition of P i and Glc-6-P or its analog for a common anion binding site in this region (5, 6, 9), now shown directly by X-ray crystallographic structure determination (see below). The ability of P i to antagonize inhibition of the expressed wild-type enzyme was confirmed in the present study (Fig. 3). Low millimole levels of P i partially reversed the inhibition seen with subsaturating levels of 1,5-AnG-6-P, while further increases in [P i] led to the expected inhibition. This antagonistic effect of P i was drastically reduced with the D84A and D84E

(17) have recently reported a similar effect of the D84A mutation in human Type I hexokinase, with a marked decrease in the ability of P i to reverse inhibition of the mutant enzyme by 1,5-AnG6-P. In contrast, all mutants were similar to wild-type hexokinase in their inhibition by higher levels of P i

Activity was determined with 0.41 mM ATP (approximately K m for both wild-type and mutant proteins) and sufficient 1,5-AnG-6-P to reduce the rate to 50 ­70% of that seen in the absence of this inhibitor (approx equal to twice the K i for the respective wild-type or mutant enzyme). Sodium phosphate (either 250 mM or 1 M, both adjusted to the pH of the assay medium, pH 8.5) was added to give the indicated concentrations of P i.

(Fig. 3 and Table II). Although the D84K mutation did result in a slight but statistically significant decrease in the K i for P i, the D84A and D84E mutations had no effect on this parameter (Table II). The structure of Type I hexokinase complexed with Glc and P i. The complex of Type I hexokinase with Glc and P i exists as a dimer in the crystal structure, as previously found for the complex with Glc and Glc-6-P (16, 18). The individual monomers have Glc bound to "closed" conformations (18) in both N- and C-terminal halves. Phosphate anions, clearly distinguishable as high peaks in difference electron density maps, are found at high occupancy in both N- and C-terminal binding clefts, occupying the same position as the phosphate moiety of Glc-6-P (Fig. 2). Only very limited conformational differences are evident between the structures of the complex with P i and the isomorphous complex with Glc-6-P (18). These are restricted to the immediate vicinity of the Glc-6-P binding site and do not extend into the adjacant putative ATP-binding region (16, 27). In both the P i and Glc-6-P complexes, the same contacts are seen at the interface between N- and C-terminal domains within the monomer, thus showing no difference between these ligands, one inhibitory and one an antagonist of that inhibition, in terms of altered interactions between the N- and C-terminal halves (A. Mulichak et al., manuscript in preparation). These observations are consistent with the view (18) that interactions between the N- and C-terminal halves, upon which regulatory properties depend (5, 6, 9), are much more intimate in the functional monomeric form of the enzyme and that the "extended" conformation of the monomer observed in the crystallized dimer is not the allosterically functional conformation of the enzyme.

DISCUSSION

SEBASTIAN ET AL.

Mutation of Asp 532, involved in binding of Glc-6-P at the C-terminal site (16, 18), does not affect inhibition of the functional monomer of Type I hexokinase (27)--the mean SD K i values were 26 4.8, 29 3.1, and 25 8.8 M for the wild type, D532E, and D532K mutants, respectively. In a more recent paper (17) from this same research group, it was reported that the D84A mutation had "no major effect" on the K i value for inhibition by 1,5-AnG-6-P. Yet, the mean SD K i values given were 37.4 1.7 and 61.3 1.9 M for the wild type and D84A mutant, respectively. No indication of statistical significance was provided, but considering the relatively small SD values, it surely seems likely that the difference in these K i values is significant. Moreover, the approximately twofold difference reported by Fang et al. (17) is similar in magnitude to the indisputably significant (P 0.001) difference seen in the present work (Table II) for the wild type and D84A mutant of the rat Type I hexokinase. Thus, mutation of Asp 84, involved in binding of Glc-6-P at the N-terminal site, does have a detrimental effect on inhibition, as reflected by the increase in K i (Table II). Moreover, the effects are selective, with mutations of Asp 84 causing no change in apparent K m for ATP or Glc (Table II) and, at most, modest effects on k cat (Table I) or K i for inhibition by P i (Table II); the latter were seen only with the D84K mutant, which represents the most drastic change in side chain character. These results thus support the proposal (15), based on a totally different nonkinetic approach, that the functional site for binding of the inhibitory Glc-6-P lies in the N-terminal half of the molecule. The alternative (16, 17) demands that one accept the reverse logic that mutations in a putatively nonfunctional N-terminal site do have an effect on K i, while corresponding mutations in the putatively functional C-terminal site do not. The effects of these mutations on the K i for 1,5-AnG6-P were consistent with what would be expected from interactions detected in structural studies (16, 18). Thus, the loss of hydrogen bonding potential (D84A) or mutation to a much longer side chain (D84K) with resulting steric conflicts, albeit with preservation of hydrogen bonding capability, had a greater effect than extension by a single methylene group with preservation of side chain character (D84E), while maintenance of both side chain size and hydrogen bonding character (D84N) had no effect (23). A recent abstract by Liu et al. (30) described the effect of mutation of Thr 863, thought to be involved in binding of the 6-phosphoryl group of Glc-6-P to the C-terminal site of the dimer (16 ­18). Changing Thr 863 to Ala resulted in a 25-fold increase in the K i for Glc-6-P, but also a 4-fold increase in the K m for Glc, a

140-fold increase in the K m for ATP, and a 5000-fold decrease in k cat. It is thus evident that mutation of Thr 863 does not selectively affect inhibition by Glc-6-P. Since inhibition resulting from binding of Glc-6-P to the N-terminal site must be dependent on propagation of conformational changes to the catalytic site in the C-terminal half, it is not unexpected that mutations in the vicinity of the active site might, among other effects, alter K i. Liu et al. (30) also reported that corresponding mutations at the analogous (to Thr 863) residue in the N-terminal half, Ser 415, had no effect on kinetic parameters. However, there are multiple interactions with the 6-phosphoryl group and hexose moiety (16, 18) and thus loss of interactions with Ser 415 may have little net effect on binding of Glc-6-P at the N-terminal site. Indeed, it is likely that the existence of multiple interactions, with both the phosphoryl group as well as the hexose ring (16, 18), lead to the rather modest effects on K i resulting from mutations at Asp 84 (Table II). While greater effects might be anticipated from more severe perturbation of the Glc-6-P binding site, e.g., by mutation to Trp, the concerns associated with such drastic alterations seem obvious. Therefore, we restricted this study to relatively modest changes in size or side chain character, a logic that has presumably guided the work of others examining the effect of site directed mutations on hexokinase function (10, 17, 27, 30, 31). There is general acceptance (5, 6, 9, 10, 16, 17, 21) of the view that the ability of P i to antagonize inhibition by Glc-6-P or its analogs is mediated by binding of P i to a site in the N-terminal half. This is readily explained by competition between these ligands for a common anion binding site in the N-terminus (Fig. 2). Structural studies (16, 18, 21, and Fig. 2) do not indicate interaction of Asp 84 with the 6-phosphate group of Glc-6-P or with P i. Thus, the detrimental effect of the D84A, D84E, and D84K mutations on the ability of P i to antagonize inhibition by 1,5-AnG-6-P was quite unexpected. These results thus suggest that phosphate reversal depends on rather precise positioning of Glc6-P, or its analog, 1,5-AnG-6-P, in the N-terminal binding site. Perturbation of this positioning by mutation to smaller or larger side chains abolishes the ability of P i to displace the inhibitor and relieve inhibition. In contrast, if the functional site for binding the inhibitory Glc-6-P were indeed in the C-terminal half, it is not apparent why mutations that affect binding of the hexose moiety to a putatively nonfunctional site in the N-terminal half should affect K i or the ability of P i to reverse inhibition by Glc-6-P or its analogs. These observations also suggest an explanation for the reports of many years ago (32, 33) that the ability of P i to reverse inhibition by Glc-6-P was lost during prolonged storage of the Type I isozyme. Since antag-

onism by P i is critically dependent on structural features near the N-terminal Glc-6-P binding site, it is conceivable that artifactual modification during prolonged storage, possibly involving cysteine residues (34), results in structural perturbations in this region with resultant effects on the ability of P i to antagonize inhibition. Mutations at the D84 position have, at most, a modest effect on K i for inhibition by P i, which is competitive vs ATP (14). This is in agreement with the view that the latter inhibitory effect results from direct competition between P i and the -phosphate of ATP for an anionic binding site in the catalytic C-terminal half (5); hence, there is no a priori reason to expect a substantial effect from mutation in the N-terminal half, and none is observed. It is clear that structural studies (16, 18) have provided extremely valuable information regarding the nature of residues involved in interactions with various ligands for Type I hexokinase. Site-directed mutagenesis studies (7, 8, 10, 17, 23, 27, 31, and present study) have yielded results largely consistent with effects predicted from structure. On the other hand, there is good reason to question whether the X-ray structural studies faithfully reflect the relative disposition of the N- and C-terminal halves and their conformational status as they exist in the functional monomeric form of the enzyme. As noted above, the monomeric units in the dimer (16, 18) are in an extended conformation (Fig. 1) that is most unlikely to allow the intimate interactions between the N- and C-terminal halves that are thought to be involved in various regulatory properties, and the extended monomers bind two Glc and two Glc-6-P molecules per 100,000 mol. wt. enzyme rather than the 1:1 stoichiometry observed with the functional monomeric form of the enzyme (12­14). In the present work, we have crystallized the rat Type I isozyme as a complex containing two P i anions, located at analogous sites in both N- and C-terminal halves, and two Glc molecules bound at equivalent positions in "closed" conformations (18) of the N- and C-terminal halves. In contrast, Aleshin et al. (21) crystallized a complex of human Type I hexokinase with Glc and P i , in which both ligands were bound to a closed conformation of the N-terminal half, while the C-terminal half contained neither ligand (at high occupancy) and was in the open conformation. Aleshin et al. (21) suggested that the Glc-binding site in the N-terminal half might, in fact, be the single site observed in binding studies (12­14). However, this is inconsistent with the observed 1:1 stoichiometry and the demonstration that the C-terminal site is, selectively, affinity labeled by a reactive Glc analog (35). These and other inconsistencies between observations with various crystal forms and proper-

ties of the functional monomer in solution suggest that intermolecular forces involved in formation of currently available crystal forms can evoke significant conformational differences. Thus, increased understanding of the intramolecular interactions that determine the catalytic and regulatory properties of Type I hexokinase must await the availability of a structure that better preserves the characteristics of the functional monomeric form.
