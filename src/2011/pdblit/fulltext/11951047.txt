expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, respectively. PGC-1 mRNA is induced in both BAT and skeletal muscles upon exposure of the animals to low temperature (16). The induction of PGC-1 by cold exposure is mediated through adrenergic receptors in BAT, but the mechanisms controlling PGC-1 expression in skeletal muscles are not known. We observed an increase of PGC-1 expression in skeletal muscles of CaMKIV* transgenic mice (Fig. 1C). A 3-kb proximal promoter region from the human PGC-1 gene was activated by a factor of 4 by CaMKIV* in C2C12 myocytes; this result suggests that CaMK signaling can induce PGC-1 gene expression at a transcriptional level (Fig. 1E). CaMKIV activates several transcription factors, such as CREB (cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element-binding protein) and MEF2 (myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2) (13, 19, 20); identification of the specific transcription factors responsible for the effect of CaMK on transcription of the PGC-1 gene will require further investigation. The expression of mitochondrial genes among specialized myofiber subtypes is proportionate to mitochondrial DNA copy number (1). Mitochondrial DNA copy number per nuclear genome was increased in skeletal muscles of MCK-CaMKIV* transgenic mice (Fig. 2A). Transmission electron microscopy performed on sections prepared from plantaris muscles of wild-type and MCK-CaMKIV* transgenic mice revealed that the mitochondria of oxidative myocytes of control plantaris occupied 24 4% of the total cross-sectional area of the myocyte, whereas in MCK-CaMKIV* plantaris this value was 38 6% (P 0.05). The average thickness of subsarcolemmal mitochondrial collections was significantly higher in the MCK-CaMKIV* plantaris than in control plantaris (1.5 0.4 m versus 1.0 0.1 m; P 0.05), as assessed from analysis of at least 200 separate muscle fibers from each group (Fig. 2B). In wild-type mice (F3 hybrid C57BL/6 SJL), the average percentage of type I fibers in plantaris muscle was about 2%, whereas in MCK-CaMKIV* transgenic mice, type I fibers accounted for about 10% of the total fibers (Fig. 3, A and B). The changes in gene expression and muscle ultrastructure that occurred as consequence of CaMK activity were accompanied by improved contractile performance (fatigue resistance) during repetitive contractions of isolated muscle (EDL) preparations (21) (Fig. 3C). The ability of the CaMKIV* transgene to increase the abundance of type I fibers resembles the response to activated calcineurin (10). However, the induction of PGC-1, increased expression of mitochondrial genes, and increased expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins was much greater in CaMKIV*-transgenic mice than in calcineurintransgenic animals (Fig. 3, D and E). Endogenous CaMKIV is not highly expressed in skeletal muscles (12), but CaMKI is abundant in this tissue (22, 23), and constitutively active forms of CaMKI and CaMKIV are equally potent in activating target genes in a skeletal myocyte background (Fig. 3F). Overall, our data suggest that CaMK mediates contractile activity-dependent gene regulation in muscle tissues and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. Further studies will be required to identify the specific CaMK isoform and the specific substrates of CaMK responsible for these effects. Habitual patterns of physical activity have profound effects on human performance in athletes, in healthy individuals during normal aging, and in patients with chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure or respiratory insufficiency. Greater understanding of the molecular signaling pathways by which skeletal muscles sense and respond to changing activity patterns by altering programs of gene expression ultimately may promote the development of novel measures to enhance human performance.

Structure of a Cofactor-Deficient Nitrogenase MoFe Protein

One of the most complex biosynthetic processes in metallobiochemistry is the assembly of nitrogenase, the key enzyme in biological nitrogen fixation. We describe here the crystal structure of an iron-molybdenum cofactor­ deficient form of the nitrogenase MoFe protein, into which the cofactor is inserted in the final step of MoFe protein assembly. The MoFe protein folds as a heterotetramer containing two copies each of the homologous and subunits. In this structure, one of the three subunit domains exhibits a substantially changed conformation, whereas the rest of the protein remains essentially unchanged. A predominantly positively charged funnel is revealed; this funnel is of sufficient size to accommodate insertion of the negatively charged cofactor. The two-component enzyme nitrogenase provides the biochemical machinery for the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia (1­7 ). Biosynthesis of both components, the Fe protein and the MoFe protein, is a complex process, requiring at least 15 different gene products. The MoFe protein (8), an 2 2 tetramer, contains in each half two complex metal clusters that are unique in biology and that have yet to be chemically synthesized. One, designated the P cluster, is an [8Fe-7S] cluster that is coordinated by six Cys ligands and bridges the and subunits. The other, designated FeMo cofactor (FeMoco), is a [Mo-7Fe-9S] cluster that also contains an endogenous organic component (homocitrate) and is connected to the protein by only two ligands, a Cys and a His, located within the subunit. The FeMoco represents the site of substrate binding and reduction. In the cell,

the FeMoco is synthesized as a separate, but protein-associated, entity that is subsequently inserted into a P cluster­containing, FeMocodeficient form of the MoFe protein. In vitro, it has long been possible to obtain FeMoco by extracting it from the MoFe holoprotein into the organic solvent N-methyl formamide (9). Recently, it also became possible to purify large quantities of a His-tag version (10) of the inactive FeMoco-deficient, but P cluster­containing, MoFe protein from a nifB strain (11). The nifB gene encodes for a protein involved in the biosynthesis of an iron and sulfur­containing precursor of FeMoco (1). The in vitro addition of isolated FeMoco to the cofactor-deficient MoFe protein from a nifB strain results in an active holoprotein without the requirement of any other factors. Because the FeMoco site is fully buried 10 Å below the surface of the MoFe protein (8), this final cofactor insertion reaction must involve substantial conformational rearrangements in the protein. In this study, the structure of the FeMoco-deficient MoFe protein from an Azotobacter vinelandii nifB strain ( nifB-Av1) has been solved to 2.3 Å resolution, revealing the pathway through which the FeMoco is inserted in the final step of MoFe protein assembly. The determination of the nifB-Av1 structure is summarized in Table 1. As is the case for the MoFe holoprotein (Av1), the nifB-Av1 2 2 tetramer consists of a pair of dimers that are related by a molecular twofold rotation axis (Fig. 1A). In contrast to all crystal forms of MoFe proteins observed so far, in the nifB-Av1 crystal form, this molecular twofold axis is also crystallographic. The homologous and subunits of both nifB-Av1 (Fig. 1B) and Av1 (Fig. 1C) consist of three domains each, designated I, II, and III, and I, II, and III, respectively. All domains are organized around a common core composed of a four-stranded, parallel sheet flanked with helices and additional strands (5). Previous structures have shown that the P cluster, located between domains I and I, can exhibit different conformations that likely correspond to different oxidation states (12, 13). The conformation of the P cluster observed in the nifB-Av1 structure, as isolated and crystallized in the presence of dithionite, is assigned to the PN

state. In Av1 (Fig. 1C), the FeMoco occupies a cavity formed between domains I, II, and III, which is empty in nifB-Av1 (Fig. 1B). A comparison between the structures of Av1 and nifB-Av1 shows only minor differences in the subunit and domains I and II, whereas domain III undergoes major structural rearrangements (Fig. 2A) (14). The III domain in Av1 is organized around a six-stranded sheet composed of a parallel arrangement of the five strands shown in Fig. 2, in the order 5, 4, 1, 2, 3, and a sixth antiparallel strand (designated 1 ), consisting of residues 31 to 35, which is located adjacent to strand 3 (8). The C positions and secondary structure elements of nifB-Av1 relative to those of Av1 in the

region of the III domain that includes 345 to the COOH-terminus are shown in Fig. 2A. A superposition of the polypeptide folds of the two structures in this same region is shown in Fig. 2B. The two strands 1 (not shown) and 3, at one end of the six-stranded sheet in Av1, are disordered in nifB-Av1, whereas the remaining strands are shorter toward their COOH-terminus relative to those in Av1, with the largest positional changes observed for strands 1 and 2, which are spatially closest to the disordered region. Accompanying these changes, helices A, C, and D in the III domain of nifB-Av1 are shorter toward their NH2-terminus, relative to Av1. The region including the disordered residues 381 to 407 corre-

sponds to the site of an 50-residue insertion in the MoFe protein from Clostridium pasteurianum (15), which folds as a large external loop without changing the III domain arrangement. These conformational changes in the III domain have important consequences for the region of the MoFe protein involved in FeMoco binding. Selected residues in the FeMoco site are illustrated in Fig. 3 for comparison of the nifB-Av1 and Av1 structures. In Av1, the FeMoco is coordinated by only two ligands, His 442 to the Mo atom and Cys 275 to the Fe atom that is located on the opposite side of the cluster from the Mo atom. As Cys 275 is part of domain II that is unaltered in nifB-Av1, it occupies the same position in both structures. In contrast, the C of His 442 shifts by 5 Å during the III domain rearrangement. In nifB-Av1, it joins two other residues, His 274 and His 451, to form a striking His triad. His 442 is strictly conserved, and histidines are found at positions 274 and 451 in 80% of known MoFe protein sequences (16). Coupled to this rearrangement, residues His 442 and Trp 444 switch their relative positions between nifB-Av1 and Av1. Trp 444 is present in 80% of known sequences (16) and is replaced by a Tyr residue in all other sequences. Substantial changes take place in nonliganding residues as well, particularly the stretch from 355 to 359 with Gly 356, Gly 357, and Arg 359 that hydrogen-bond to sulfurs of the cofactor in the holoprotein. At the homocitrate end of the FeMoco, the position of Lys 426 shifts between Av1 and nifB-Av1 (Fig. 3). A comparison of the molecular surfaces of nifB-Av1 (Fig. 4A) and Av1 (Fig. 4B) demonstrates that the residue rearrangements occurring in domain III create a funnel that allows entry of the FeMoco into the MoFe protein. Despite the prevailing negative surface charge of nifB-Av1, which will be further accentuated by the approximately ­7 net charge of the disordered loop, there is an evident accumulation of positive surface charge lining the funnel the entire way from the entrance down to the FeMoco binding site

(Fig. 4A). This electrostatic feature presumably serves to steer the negatively charged FeMoco (17 ) into the correct position for the holoprotein. The loop from residues 353 to 364 (Figs. 2 and 3), which contains the positively charged residues Arg 359 and Arg 361, as well as His 362, is located at the entrance of the funnel. Additional Lys ( 315 and 426), Arg ( 96, 97, and 277), and His ( 274, 442, and 451) residues in the funnel area create a positively charged environment and provide a path for the FeMoco insertion. The dominant contribution of the homocitrate to the negative charge of FeMoco suggests that the homocitrate/Mo end of the FeMoco will first enter the funnel, encountering His 442 at the bottom of the funnel as the initial Mo atom docking point. This initial binding of FeMoco could trigger a rearrangement in the positions of His 442/ Trp 444 that leads to the formation of strand 5, concomitant with the COOH-terminal extension of the other strands, and subsequent closing up of the domain. Although the biosynthesis of nitrogenase is a particularly involved process because of the complexity of the metalloclusters, even for "simpler" metalloproteins, incorporation of transition metals into active sites involves the participation of multiple proteins to ensure proper uptake and distribution. This has been most clearly demonstrated for coppercontaining proteins, where copper is delivered to the active site of target proteins through direct protein-protein interactions between the target and specialized proteins known as "metallochaperones" (18 ­21). The best characterized copper metallochaperones are found to be homologous to their target proteins. Formation of the target apoproteinmetallochaperone complex is mediated by subunit-subunit interactions that mimic those found in the holoprotein. As a result of this hetero-oligomeric association, the active site is opened for access by the metal coordinated to the metallochaperone, with subsequent transfer of metal between the two proteins, dissociation of the protein-protein complex, and reformation of the holoprotein oligomer. It has been suggested that this subunit exchange mechanism observed for copper-containing proteins may be a general feature of the interaction between target proteins and metallochaperones, including the assembly of proteins such as the MoFe protein (21). The process of FeMoco incorporation into the cofactor-deficient MoFe protein exhibits intriguing similarities, as well as distinctive features, relative to these observations on coppercontaining proteins. Both systems appear to share a common requirement for protein-protein interactions for incorporation of the metallocenter. Given the instability of the isolated FeMoco, it is likely that the biosynthetic pathway involves protein-bound species and not free cofactor; a number of proteins have been implicated as carrying precursors to FeMoco (1, 4, 22), including the NifEN protein that is homologous to the MoFe protein (23), although the penultimate carrier preceding incorporation into the MoFe protein has not been conclusively identified. It appears unlikely from the structure of nifB-Av1 that cofactor insertion involves subunit-subunit exchange of the type documented for copper-containing proteins; the

subunit interfaces are extensive, include the P cluster in both nifB-Av1 and Av1, and should remain intact. However, the rearrangement of the III domain, in addition to generating the opening for FeMoco insertion, may also create a potential interaction domain that enables residues found in the disordered region of the nifB-Av1 structure to dock with the FeMoco donor.

An outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred in the Dominican Republic (13 confirmed cases) and Haiti (8 confirmed cases, including 2 fatal cases) during 2000 ­2001. All but one of the patients were either unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children, and cases occurred in communities with very low (7 to 40%) rates of coverage with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The outbreak was associated with the circulation of a derivative of the type 1 OPV strain, probably originating from a single OPV dose given in 1998 ­1999. The vaccinederived poliovirus associated with the outbreak had biological properties indistinguishable from those of wild poliovirus. The last case of poliomyelitis in the Americas associated with circulating indigenous wild poliovirus was reported in Peru in 1991 (1). The last poliomyelitis cases in the Caribbean occurred on the island of Hispaniola, which is divided between the Dominican Republic

(where the last reported case was in 1985) and Haiti (where the last reported case was in 1989). Since 1992, investigation of nearly 20,000 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) throughout the Americas (2) has found only sporadic cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) (3). The only known wild poliovirus infections in the Americas after 1991 were associated with importations into Canada (4, 5). Neither of these importations was associated with paralytic disease, and there was no evidence of the spread of the virus to the wider community. In the summer of 2000, cases of AFP were reported from Bonao, Dominican Republic (date of onset: 12 July), and Port-de-Paix, Haiti (date of onset: 28 August), communities that are separated by 300 km (Fig. 1) (6). Stool specimens collected from the patients were positive for poliovirus type 1. An initial characterization of the isolates by nucleic acid probe hybridization (7) indicated that they were vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). In countries using oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), VDPV is occasionally isolated from the stools of patients with nonpolio AFP (2, 3). However, several observations raised concerns that the AFP cases in Hispaniola might be caused by
