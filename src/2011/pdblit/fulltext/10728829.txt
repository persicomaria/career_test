The basic phospholipase 4 (PLA,) from venom of the African elapid Nuja nigricollis was previously shown to have anti-coagulant and lethal properties, both of which were abolished by treatment with p-bromophenacyl bromide (pBP). In the present paper we first report that pBP-treated PLA, is capable of inhibiting the anti-coagulant activity but not the lethal activity of native PLA,, thus suggesting that both properties might be independent. We then confirm this evidence using PL&-specific monoclonal immunoglobulins. One of these, called HSF, neutralized the lethal activity but not the anti-coagulant activity, whereas another antibody, called HSPZ, inhibited the anti-coagulant activity but not the lethal activity of the PL4. The data presented in this paper are taken as evidence that the anti-coagulant activity is not implicated in the lethal effects of basic PL4 from Nuja nigricollis.

1. INTRODUCTION Snake venom phospholipases A2 (PLA2) belong to a family of structurally homologous [l-3] proteins that exhibit esterase activity (EC 3.1.1.4). They display a variety of pharmacological effects which sometimes render them highly toxic. Snake venom PLA2 can be classified into three groups, depending on their toxicity. The first group comprises acidic and neutral PLA2 with little or no toxicity. The second group comprises highly toxic PLAz which block acetylcholine release from nerve endings [4,5] and/or provoke muscle damage [6]. The third group comprises relatively toxic and basic (~1~9) PLA2 with strong in vitro anticoagulant activity associated with a marked ability to penetrate densely packed phospholipid monolayers [7]. Anti-coagulant PLA2 have been isolated from Crotalidae [8], Viperidue [9] and Elapidue [lo] venoms. The most active of them is the basic PLA2 from the African spitting cobra Nuja nigricollis [7].

The strong anti-coagulant activity was attributed to the hydrophobic character of basic PLAz [ 11,121 and to the amino acid sequence between residues 54 and 77 [ 131. In the present study we used (i) a chemical derivative modified with p-bromophenacyl bromide and (ii) specific monoclonal antibodies to demonstrate that the anti-coagulant and lethal activities of basic PLAz from Naja nigricollis are independent properties. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Lyophilized Naja nigricollis venom was supplied by the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France). Porcine pancreatic PLAz was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Penzberg, FRG). All chemicals were of the purest grade commercially available. Purification of basic PLA2 from Naja nigricollis venom was performed as previously described [14]. The last step involved a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a butyl large-pore column (4.6 x 250 mm) using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1 Vo trifluoroacetic acid: 28% to 32% CHaCN for 120 min at a flow rate of 750pVmin. The basic PLAz was previously designated as nigexine [14] and its primary sequence was recently elucidated (submitted for publication). Modification with p-bromophenacyl bromide (pBP) was carried out as previously described [15] and pBP-treated PLAz was purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a butyl large-pore column (4.6 x 250 mm) using a 120 min linear

acetonitrile gradient (29% to 34%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, at a flow rate of 750 pl/min [16]. Amino acid analysis of pBPtreated PLAz indicated the unique loss of, one histidine residue per molecule and the molar extinction coefficient at 276.5 nm was determined as 45 500. Immunization in BALB/c mice consisted of six subcutaneous injections, one every two weeks. Each animal was successively injected with: (1) 2OOyg PLA2 mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (1: 1; v/v); (2) 200 peg PLAz mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant; (3) 400rg PLA2 mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant; (4) 100 pg PLAz in physiological saline; (5 and 6) 2OOpg PLAz in physiological saline. The fusion procedure was carried out according to KGhler and Milstein [17]. Hybrid-containing wells were tested by liquid-phase radioimmunoassay using `2Sl-labelled PLA2. Positive wells were cloned by limiting dilution. Monoclonal antibodies were produced in ascitic fluids in syngenic BALB/c mice. Antibodies (HSF, IgGlx; HSPl, IgGlx; HSP2, IgGZax) were purified in batches according to Reik et al. [18] using caprylic acid, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The last purification step consisted of ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography on a column of polyvinylimidazole silica-bonded phase, a weak anion-exchange resin (SFCC, Neuilly-Plaisance, France). The purity of monoclonal antibody preparations was assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (Phast System, Pharmacia). Calcium clotting time assays [19] were carried out on platelet suspensions using standard platelet concentrates purchased from CNTS (les Ulis, France). Platelets (3.5 +0.2 x 10' cells per pl) were suspended in saline buffer containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM NazHPOd, 10 mM glucose and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid/NaOH buffer, pH 7.4 (Hepes-buffered saline). 200 pl of a mixture of 100 ~1 of the sample to be tested in Hepes-buffered saline and 100 ~1 of a solution containing 20 mM CaC12and 0.14 M NaCl, were added to 200 pl of the platelet suspension in a 5-ml glass test-tube, all solutions being maintained at 37°C. Median lethal dose (LDso) determinations were carried out using the sequential up-and-down method of Dixon and Mood [20]. Female BALB/c mice (20 f 1 g) were injected in the tail vein with various amounts of: (i) basic PLA2; (ii) pBP-treated PLA2; (iii) pBP-treated PLA2 mixed with native PLAz; or (iv) antibody-PLAz complex. Antibodies and pBP-treated PLA2 were incubated with the basic PLA2 for 4 h at 37°C. Eight mice were injected per dose and survivors were counted 48 h after injection.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. pBP-treated PLAa: an inhibitor of anticoagulant activity The basic PLAz from Naja nigricoflis venom is a potent in vitro anti-coagulant factor [7,10,21]. As illustrated in fig. lA, the control clotting time of platelets was equal to 150 s and a concentration of 2 x 10e8 M PLA2 was sufficient to double this time. Treatment with pBP, a reagent which modifies a critical histidine residue at the PLAz ac2

in a derivative with l/750 of the anti-coagulant activity of native PLAz (fig. 1A). Two lines of evidence indicated that this residual activity was not due to traces of contaminating native PLA2. Firstly, pBP-treated PLA2 was highly pure as judged from several analytical criterions reported elsewhere [ 141. Secondly, its enzymatic activity, if any, was less than 0.01% of that of native PLAz [16]. The residual anti-coagulant activity of pBP-treated PLA2 is likely, therefore, to be an intrinsic property of the molecule. Decreases in anti-coagulant after treatment of PLA2 with pBP has also been observed by other authors [7].

Strikingly, we observed that pBP-treated ?LAz inhibited the clotting effect of native PLA2. In the of a non-anti-coagulant dose of presence 8 x 10v7 M pBP-treated PLA2, a concentration of 8 x lo-* M of native PLA2 was required to double the coagulation time (fig. lA), or, in other words, the activity of basic PLA2 preincubated with pBPtreated PLAz decreased by 75%. This large change indicated that the inhibitory activity was not due to contaminating PLA2 but was a genuine property of the derivative. We also observed that the anticoagulant activity of native PLA2 was unaffected by addition of 8 x 10e7 M porcine pancreatic PLA2, a non-toxic PLA2 with weak anti-coagulant activity (fig. lA), indicating that inhibition of the anti-coagulant effect by pBP-treated PLA2 was specific. Interestingly, it was previously shown that pBP-treated PLA2 is still able to bind phospholipids [21]. Conceivably, the inhibitory property of pBP-treated PLAz was due to its ability to prevent native PLAz from binding to coagulation specifying phospholipids [22], perhaps by a competitive process. Although the anti-coagulant properties of snake venom PLA2 have been extensively studied, it is not yet clear whether this activity is related to the lethal activity of the molecule. We reasoned that if both properties are closely linked, pBP-treated PLA2 might inhibit the lethal action of the native molecule, as it inhibited anti-coagulant activity. We therefore injected mice intravenously with various amounts of native PLA2 mixed with a lOO-fold molar excess of non-toxic pBP-treated PLA2 (table 1) and found that the original toxicity of native PLA2 remained unchanged (table 1). We considered this result as a preliminary indication that the lethal and anti-coagulant activities of basic PLA2 might be unrelated properties. This possibility was subsequently confirmed. 3.2. Monoclonal antibodies can discriminate between anti-coagulant and lethal activities of basic PLA2 Monoclonal antibodies bind to discrete areas which can incorporate as many as 16 amino acid residues [23], and constitute ideal tools for targetted probing of differend regions of protein surfaces. Using the procedure of Kohler and Milstein [17], we isolated three hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies designated HSF, HSPl, and HSP2

which all bind specifically to 1251-labelled basic PLAz (not shown). We first investigated the effect of each antibody on lethality (table 1). In the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of HSF, 5 LDso of PLAz could be injected intravenously in mice without inducing any mortality. Clearly, a single monoclonal antibody was sufficient to neutralize lethality. This observation was all the more interesting as the other two antibodies did not exhibit this property since addition of a 50- to 500-fold molar excess of either HSPl or HSP2 did not change the lethal potency of PLAz (table 1). The mechanisms associated with the neutralizing property of HSF are unknown. We then investigated the effect of the antibodies on anti-coagulant activity. As shown in fig. lB, this property remained unchanged when PLA2 was incubated in the presence of a 500-fold molar excess of HSF or HSPl . The epitopes recognized by these two antibodies were clearly unrelated to the area associated with the anti-coagulant property of PLAz. In sharp contrast, in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of HSP2, anti-coagulant activity decreased dramatically: a concentration of 4 x 10m7M of PLAz was required to double the coagulation time. In other words the residual coagulant activity of the PLAz-HSP2 complex was approx. 5% of that of the PLAt alone. The mechanisms associated with the capacity of HSF to neutralize anti-coagulant activity are as yet unknown. However, it will be of interest, in the future, to examine whether the epitope recognized by this antibody is located within the region comprising residues 54-77, which has been suggested to be associated with the anti-coagulant activity of basic PLA2 [13]. The data reported above clearly show that three PLAz-specific monoclonal antibodies have different properties. Firstly, HSF neutralized lethality but not anti-coagulant activity of PLA2. This result constituted in itself a strong indication that lethal and anti-coagulant activities were independent properties. Secondly, HSP2 was observed to be a potent inhibitor of anti-coagulant activity but ,did not neutralize the lethal potency of PLA2. This result agreed with the previous conclusion that the two properties were independent, although it should be emphasized that the inability of HSP2 to neutralize in vivo lethal activity could not be interpreted completely satisfactorily, since the original 3

The monoclonal antibodies were preincubated with basic PLAz for 4 h at 37°C. The HSF antibody was used at a 50-fold molar excess over PLAz, and the HSPl and HSP2 antibodies were used at a 500-fold molar excess. When mixed with native PLAz, the amount of pBP-treated PLA2 used was 3700 nmol per kg bodyweight.

4. CONCLUSION The two following conclusions could be drawn from the present study. Firstly, pBP-treated PLA2 inhibited the anti-coagulant activity but not the lethal property of native PLA2. Secondly, monoclonal antibodies could selectively inhibit one of the two properties but not both concomitantly. These data indicate that the anti-coagulant activity is not implicated in the lethal activity of basic PLA2 from Naja nigricollis. Further work is now required to investigate (i) the inhibitory activity of pBP-treated PLAz towards other anti-coagulant agents; (ii) the effect of the different antibodies on the other properties of PLA2, including esterase activity, cytotoxicity [ 14,161 and hemolytic activity and (iii) the localization of the different epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies.
