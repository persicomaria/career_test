The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. The search for new PPAR ligands with reduced adverse effects with respect to the marketed antidiabetic agents thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and the dual-agonists glitazars is highly desired. We report the crystal structure and activity of the two enantiomeric forms of a clofibric acid analogue, respectively complexed with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPAR, and provide an explanation on a molecular basis for their different potency and efficacy against PPAR. The more potent S-enantiomer is a dual PPARR/PPAR agonist which presents a partial agonism profile against PPAR. Docking of the S-enantiomer in the PPARR-LBD has been performed to explain its different subtype pharmacological profile. The hypothesis that partial agonists show differential stabilization of helix 3, when compared to full agonists, is also discussed. Moreover, the structure of the complex with the S-enantiomer reveals a new region of the PPAR-LBD never sampled before by other ligands.
Introduction PPARsa belong to the nuclear receptors superfamily,1,2 and they are transcription factors activated by specific ligands, which are usually lipophilic small molecules.3 Binding of these ligands results in conformational changes of the receptors that facilitate their interaction with coactivator proteins in the nucleus.2,4,5 The resulting protein complexes activate the transcription of specific target genes, resulting in the induction of intracellular signalling cascades that mediate the physiological effects of the ligands.6,7 So far, three PPAR subtypes have been described in mammals: PPARR, PPAR, and PPAR /. All of these are targets for treatment of the metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes including obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and elevated fasting blood glucose.2 The fibrate class of lipidlowering drugs (e.g., fenofibrate and gemfibrozil) are PPARR ligands.8-10 The marketed TZD class of antidiabetic agents (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) activates PPAR.11,12 They enhance insulin sensitivity in target tissues and lower glucose and fatty acid levels in type 2 diabetic patients. However, despite their proven benefits, these drugs have been plagued by certain adverse effects such as weight gain, higher rate of bone fractures, fluid accumulation, and pulmonary edema, leading to increased frequency of congestive heart failure.13-15 A new class of dual agonists, glitazars, have elicited high hopes and deep disappointment as potential new drugs.

PPAR dual agonists, glitazars are designed to treat both insulin resistance and key aspects of dyslipidemia that contribute to the high risk of cardiovascular diseases in diabetics. The two lead compounds in this class are muraglitazar and tesaglitazar, but both drugs were discontinued because of important side effects.14,15 One of the key challenges for the development of a dual agonist is identifying the optimal receptor subtype selectivity ratio. The intrinsic potencies at each receptor subtype will ultimately determine the overall efficacy with respect to metabolic effects and minimized side effects. All failed PPAR agonists to date are apparently pure PPAR or PPARpreferential dual agonists. Consequently, most safety issues that led to development discontinuations are rather associated with overactivation of PPAR than with action on the R subtype. New drugs, which act as partial agonists of PPAR, have been developed with the goal of retaining the beneficial effects while diminishing the adverse effects. Metaglidasen (see Figure 1), a PPAR partial agonist, is the most advanced insulin sensitizer that is currently in phase III clinical trials. The results of phase II clinical trials showed that metaglidasen, a prodrug ester that is rapidly and completely modified in vivo to its mature circulating free acid form, significantly improved metabolic parameters without the side effects of fluid retention/edema or weight gain.14 Recently, we reported the synthesis and activity of some chiral clofibric acid analogues16 whose structures are

related to that of the active metabolite of metaglidasen. These compounds show dual activity toward PPARR and PPAR with the stereochemistry playing a crucial role in the receptor activation. In the search for a well balanced dual agonist, we focused our attention on full agonist (S)-1 (Figure 1) displaying a selectivity ratio equal to 1. A more in-depth investigation of PPARR/PPAR agonist activity of this ligand and its enantiomer revealed that the former has a lower efficacy on PPAR compared to that previously reported16 and is about 10 times more potent than the latter. On the other hand, the R-enantiomer is completely devoid of activity on PPARR. Here, we report the X-ray structures of the PPAR-LBD in the complex with (S)-1 and (R)-1, respectively, and compare their structures, providing a molecular explanation for their different potency against PPAR. Moreover, we compare the structure of the more potent S-enantiomer with that of the same ligand docked in the hydrophobic pocket of PPARR and provide an explanation at the molecular level for its different behavior as full and partial agonist of PPARR and PPAR, respectively. Noteworthy, we also characterize a new region of the PPAR internal hydrophobic pocket never sampled before by other PPAR agonists that could be exploited in the design of new PPAR ligands. Results and Discussion Chemistry. The two enantiomers (S)-1 and (R)-1 were obtained as previously reported16 by a two-step procedure including the condensation of 4-phenylphenol with the optically active methyl phenyllactates under Mitsunobu conditions followed from alkaline hydrolysis (in Scheme 1 the synthesis of (S)-1 is depicted). However, the employment of triphenylphosphine supported on cross-linked styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer resin (PPh3-PS) allowed us to simplify the workup of the first reaction and to improve the overall yield from 39% to 77-81%, leaving unchanged the enantiomeric excess of g98%. Transcriptional Activation of PPARr and  Subtypes by (S)-1 and (R)-1. In previous studies we had shown that new enantiomeric compounds were active toward both the PPARR and  subtypes.16 To gain more insight on the activity of one of these ligands displaying a selectivity ratio equal to 1, we first determined the effect of its enantiomeric forms, (S)-1 and (R)-1, on the transcriptional activity of a panel of nuclear receptors. As shown in Figure 2A, (S)-1 activates both PPARR and PPAR but does not affect the transcriptional activity of the other tested nuclear receptors. Conversely, (R)-1 activates only PPAR. We next compared the potency and efficacy of the two enantiomers to those of the known PPARR and  agonist, Wy 14,643 and rosiglitazone, respectively. The concentration-response curves obtained from cell-based assays indicate that (S)-1 is a more potent PPARR agonist than Wy 14,643, here used as the reference (Figure 2B). The EC50 of (S)-1 is about 1 order of magnitude lower than that of Wy 14,643 (Table 2), whereas the efficacy is comparable, suggesting that this compound is a full PPARR agonist. We also tested these compounds with the murine PPARR, and in this case Wy 14,643 is more potent than (S)-1 (Table 2). The potency of (S)-1 on the murine PPARR is comparable to that of the human, while the EC50 of Wy 14,643 with the murine receptor is much lower

(Table 2). The R-enantiomer is not active on both human PPARR (Figure 2B and Table 2) and mouse PPARR (Table 2). Both the R and S-enantiomers activate PPAR (Figure 2C), although their potency is significantly lower than that of the reference PPAR agonist rosiglitazone (Table 2). Interestingly, transfected cells treated with (S)-1 and (R)-1 do not achieve full activation of PPAR-dependent transcription (Figure 2C and Table 2), suggesting that these two compounds may be partial agonists of PPAR. Binding of (S)-1 to PPAR-LBD. Figure 3A shows the unambiguous positioning of the S-enantiomer fitted into the electron density map calculated in the hydrophobic pocket of PPAR. Figure 4 summarizes the binding interactions between the polar head of the S-enantiomer and the surrounding residues. One of the carboxylate oxygens can form a bifurcated H-bond with the Y473 OH and the H449 N2 groups; the latter group engages the ligand ether oxygen in a further H-bond. The other carboxylate oxygen is at H-bonding distances from H323 N2, Y473 OH, and S289 OH. The residues H323, Y473, H449, and S289 are generally involved in the canonical intermolecular H-bonding network in the presence of carboxylate containing ligands. Figure 5A shows the cavity where the diphenyl group of the S-enantiomer is deeply inserted, there forming several favorable hydrophobic interactions. The bottom of the cavity is delimited by the loop 11/12 and is contoured sidewise by H3 and H11.The diphenyl group there acts as a stabilization pivot between these helices and the loop 11/12. Inside the cavity, the diphenyl group interacts on one side with L453 and more weakly with I456 of H11 and interacts on the other side with the Q286 of H3. Favorable van der Waals contacts are also realized by the benzyl group and the asymmetric carbon atom of the S-enantiomer with the S289 OH group. At the bottom of the cavity, the terminal end of the diphenyl group faces the M463 side chain of the loop 11/12. The short contact between the distal aromatic ring and M463 is well evidenced by continuous electron density between the two interacting groups (see Supporting Information Figure1). Conformational Change Induced by (S)-1 in the Hydrophobic Pocket of PPAR. A comparison between the crystal complex PPAR/(S)-1 and PPAR complexes (PDB codes 1FM9, 1K74, 1ZEO, 2GOG, 2GOH)17-20 including ligands occupying the "benzophenone pocket", a contiguous region of the hydrophobic pocket formed by H3, H7, and H11, reveals a conformational change induced by (S)-1 in the PPARLBD. Figure 6 reports the superposition between the crystal complex of the S-enantiomer with that of farglitazar (PDB code 1FM9). There, it can be seen that the rigid and straight diphenyl group of the S-enantiomer induces a switching of the F282 side chain, from the extended conformation ( 1 ) 172°), adopted in the PDB files cited above, to the folded g* conformation ( 1 ) -58°). As a consequence, the F282 side chain turns to the benzophenone pocket, leaving free its previous position that is replaced by the distal ring of the S-enantiomer. In this way, the F282 side chain could function as a gate-keeper, rendering accessible a new region for accommodation of long and straight substituents of the ligand. The size and shape of this region have been evaluated by the program VOIDOO21 (see Figure 7). The region is "L" shaped and the diphenyl group occupies the first branch, corresponding to about 50% of its entire volume (1016 Å3). We propose to name this branch "diphenyl pocket" in analogy with the "benzophenone pocket". The diphenyl pocket is delimited at the bottom by the central part of the loop 11/12. In this way the distal aromatic ring of the ligand plays the key role, normally played by F282, in stabilizing the region

including this loop. It is well known that differences in the hydrophobic packing of this loop may contribute to different H12 dynamics.22,23 This is the first structure of PPAR in which such conformational change of the F282 side chain has been observed. A similar conformational change induced by the ligand is also present in the crystal complex between the PPARR-LBD and the azetidinone derivative PPARR/ dual agonist BSM631707 (PDB code 2REW).24 This ligand forces

the side chain of F273, equivalent to F282 in PPAR, to a folded conformation that allows the accommodation of its terminal end. In this regard, we solved the crystal structure of the complex of PPAR-LBD with the previously reported16 PPARR/ dual agonist (S)-2, structurally related to (S)-1, only differing in the ethyl group replacing the distal aromatic ring of (S)-1 (see Figure 8).

Also, in this case the conformational change of the F282 side chain induced by the ligand (see Supporting Information Figure 2a,b) has been observed. It could be argued that even the presence of small substituents in the para position of the phenoxy group of (S)-1 could provoke the rearrangement of F282 side chain. Since (S)-1 occupies only the first branch of the new L-shaped region, we decided to start the preparation of some analogues characterized from the presence on the diphenyl system of groups that could allow the complete occupation of the entire cavity with the aim of evaluating the effects due to a further stabilization of H11, H12, and the loop 11/12 in terms of potency, efficacy, and subtype selectivity. At the present, only the (S)-3 and (S)-4 analogues reported in Figure 8 have been synthesized and evaluated for their PPARR/ activity. These compounds were prepared similarly to (S)-1 (all synthetic details will be reported elsewhere) and are characterized from an increased flexibility due to the presence of one or two methylenic groups between the phenyl rings of (S)-1 which in our mind could allow the accommodation of the distal aromatic ring inside the second branch of the L-shaped region. However, the results do not show any significant modification of the activity on PPAR (EC50 ) 0.57 ( 0.01 µM, efficacy ) 40% ( 4% for (S)-3; EC50 ) 0.40 ( 0.20 µM, efficacy ) 33% ( 5% for (S)4) and only an increased potency of PPARR activation for (S)-3 (EC50 ) 0.011 ( 0.002 µM, efficacy ) 107% ( 5% for (S)-3; EC50 ) 0.15 ( 0.04 µM, efficacy ) 83% ( 10% for (S)-4). The interpretation of these results by X-ray structure analysis of the complexes of these new ligands with PPAR-LBD is in progress.

Binding of (R)-1 to PPAR-LBD. Figure 3B represents the R-enantiomer fitted into the 2Fo - Fc electron density map. Figure 5B shows a CR superposition of the complexes PPAR/ (S)-1 and PPAR/(R)-1. Inside the cavity, (R)-1 occupies a different region with respect to (S)-1, between H3 and the -sheet. In this way the polar head of (R)-1 cannot form the usual network of H-bonds with H323, H449, and Y473, and it does not interact at all with H11 and H12. The carboxylate group of (R)-1 forms one H-bond with S342 NH of the -sheet and engages the charged R288 residue of H3 in an electrostatic interaction. Obviously, the positioning of (R)-1 in a different region of the cavity leaves the F282 side chain in its usual conformation. The position of (R)-1 is similar to that of the partial agonists nTZDpa and BVT.13 in the complexes with PPAR (PDB codes 2Q5S and 2Q6S);25,26 also in that case these compounds formed a H-bond with the NH of S342. Molecular Mechanism of Partial Agonism. (S)-1 is a PPARR/ dual agonist that shows full agonism on PPARR (Figure 2A and Table 2) and partial agonism on PPAR (see Figure 2C and Table 2). To explain this different subtype behavior, we have docked (S)-1 into the PPARR-LBD and we have superimposed the putative complex with the crystal complex PPAR/(S)-1, as shown in Figure 9A. The polar head of the ligand in the complex with PPARR is shifted of about 1.5 Å toward H3 with respect to the position adopted in the crystal complex of PPAR. This shift is caused by the longer protrusion of the Y314 side chain of PPARR, equivalent to H323 of PPAR. As a consequence, the diphenyl group adopts a slope different from that observed in the crystal complex of PPAR, approaching H11 more closely and partially losing interactions with H3. The favorable van der Waals contacts between the diphenyl group and residues belonging to H11 of PPARR are the following: 3.6 and 2.9 Å, respectively, with CR and CO of V444, 3.4 Å with the side chain of I447, and 3.4 Å with CR of K448 (see Figure 9B). These contacts, together with that realized with the loop 11/12, better stabilize the contiguous H12, with a consequent improvement of the efficacy of the ligand toward PPARR. On the other hand, the partial agonism of the S-enantiomer toward PPAR can be attributed to a lower stabilization of H11 and increased stabilization of H3, as before discussed. In order to check the interaction pattern of (S)-1 with H3 and H11 of both PPARR and PPAR, we carried out MD simulations in water solution at 300 K. In this regard, we considered as an interacting couple, two noncovalently bonded atoms experiencing a contact shorter than 3.9 Å with a probability not lower than 0.37, corresponding to a negative free energy of formation at 300 K. The result, schematically

reported in Figure 10, confirms that (S)-1 interacts with both H3 and H11 of PPARR and only with H3 of PPAR. In order to also evaluate the mechanical stabilization caused by the above interactions, we focused our attention on the change of the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of these helices, upon complexation with PPARR and PPAR. As a result, we observed very low RMSF of both helices in the apo form of PPARR, the result being practically unaffected upon complexation. For PPAR we registered a limited but clear reduction of the RMSF, from 1.0 ( 0.2 Å (apo form) to 0.7 ( 0.2 Å (complexed form) for H3. A rather low RMSF (0.3 (

0.2 Å) characterizes H11 of both apo and complexed forms (see Supporting Information Figure 3a,b). Moreover, the analysis of the average distances between the carboxylate oxygens of the ligand and the N2 of H449, the N2 of of H323, the OH of Y473, and the OH of S289 (N2 of H440, OH of Y314, Y464, and S280, respectively, in PPARR) shows that in the MD simulation of the PPAR complex only the H-bond with Y473 is maintained, whereas in the PPARR complex all the H-bonds are maintained during the simulation (see Supporting Information Figures 4-11). Thus, the partial agonism of (S)-1 could also be ascribed to the weakening of significant H-bonds involving the carboxylate of the ligand with some conserved residues of the protein, particularly that with H449 of H11. Recently, H/D exchange kinetics and X-ray experiments have been performed for six complexes of PPAR with full and partial agonists.25 On the basis of the structures of their complexes, ligands were broadly grouped into those that occupy the portion of LBD spanning from H11 and H12 beyond H3 to those that occupy the region between H3 and the -sheet. Among the compounds of the first class, stronger transcriptional efficacy was achieved with an increased stabilization of H12 and a corresponding decrease of stabilization of H3. The compounds of this class with weaker transactivation profiles (like the S-enantiomer here described) preferentially stabilize H3 through closer hydrophobic contacts or H-bonds made with residues of this helix. This relationship is in agreement with our previous findings regarding two enantiomeric ureidofibrate derivatives complexed with PPAR, showing partial and full agonism, respectively, toward this nuclear receptor.27 Even in that case, while the full agonism of one enantiomer could be related to stronger interactions with H11, H12, and the loop 11/12, the partial agonism of the other enantiomer could be ascribed to closer contacts with a residue (Q286) of H3. Compound (R)-1 belongs to the second class of PPAR ligands; compounds belonging to this class differentially stabilize other

regions of LBD rather than H12, for example, the -sheet and H3, with modest transactivation profiles (efficacy of <50%). It has also been proposed that this differential stabilization could suggest a distinct coactivator-binding surface, consistent with the findings that regions outside the LxxLL motifs contribute to receptor binding.28 Finally, the potency of (R)-1 is lower than that of (S)-1 on the same receptor. This behavior can be easily interpreted at the molecular level by the bindings found in the relative complexes here reported. While (S)-1 forms direct H-bonding interactions with H12, (R)-1 does not interact at all with the active helix. Conclusions New drug design strategies should be considered when docking ligands on PPARs in light of the data here reported. In fact, the F282 side chain conformation in PPAR can be changed, rendering accessible a new region never explored before. Moreover, since (S)-1 occupies only the first branch of this new region, it is evident that additional space is available for bulkier substituents protruding toward H11 and H12. The complete occupation of the entire cavity would confer a further stabilization of H11, H12, and the loop 11/12 and could affect potency, efficacy, and PPARR/PPAR selectivity. This is an important point, as the design of new molecules occupying this pocket may provide the opportunity to modulate the receptor activity via the selective recruitment of coactivators that confer beneficial effects but avoid at the same time the typical side effects observed with known PPAR ligands. The preliminary

results obtained with two (S)-1 analogues endowed with increased flexibility do not show remarkable change of PPAR activity; however, more structural modifications are needed for an appropriate evaluation of this matter. For this purpose, the preparation of new derivatives characterized by the presence on the diphenyl system of groups with different stereoelectronic properties is under way. A molecular mechanism not only considering the stabilization of H12 but including even the increased stabilization of H3 and the -sheet has been elucidated for the coactivator recruitment to the receptor in response to ligands showing graded transcriptional responses. MD simulations in water solution also showed that the possible weakening of significant H-bonds realized by the ligand could be responsible for its different subtype behavior. Experimental Section

GC/MS, m/z: 332 (M+, 100). 1H NMR (CDCl3):  3.26-3.29 (m, 2H, CH2), 3.74 (s, 3H, CH3), 4.83-4.88 (dd, 1H, CH), 6.89-7.53 (m, 14H, aromatics). The R-enantiomer was prepared following the same procedure, starting from (S)-methyl phenyllactate, in 95% yield. (-)-(S)-2-(4-Phenylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropanoic Acid. A solution of the methyl ester (0.301 g, 0.907 mmol) in THF (5 mL) and 1 N NaOH (5 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The organic layer was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was acidified with 6 N HCl and extracted with Et2O. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness, affording the final acid as a white solid that was recrystallized from hexane in 84% yield (0.242 g, 0.761 mmol). 1H NMR (CDCl3):  3.22-3.38 (m, 2H, CH2), 4.84-4.94 (m, 1H, CH), 5.70 (bs, 1H, COOH, D2O exchanged), 6.88-7.60 (m, 14H, aromatics). Mp 149-50 °C; [R]D -1 (c 1.0, MeOH); 99% ee (methyl ester on Chiralcel OD column, hexane/i-PrOH 98:2 as the mobile phase, flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, detection at 230 nm). (+)-(R)-2-(4-Phenylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropanoic Acid. Yield, 81%; mp 148-9 °C; [R]D +1 (c 1.0, MeOH); 98% ee (methyl ester on Chiralcel OD column, hexane/i-PrOH 98:2 as the mobile phase, flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, detection at 230 nm). Cell-Based Transcription Assay. The expression vectors for PPARR, PPAR, and PPAR / LBD fused in frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (pGal4-PPARRLBD, pGal4-PPARLBD, pGal4-PPAR /LBD, respectively) and the reporter vector containing five copies of the Gal4 upstream activating sequences (pGal4UAS-luciferase) driving the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene were kind gifts from Krister Bamberg (AstraZeneca, Molndal, Sweden). pCMV , containing the E. coli -galactosidase ¨ gene driven by the cytomegalovirus early promoter/enhancer (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used as an internal standard to normalize for transfection efficiency across wells. All other vectors expressing Gal4 fusion proteins with the ligand binding domains of tested nuclear receptors have been described previously.27 Cell-based transcription assays were performed by transfecting HepG2 cells with 100 ng of pGal4UAS-luciferase along with 50 ng of receptor vector and 300 ng of pCMV with the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique for 4 h as described.16 After removal of the DNA coprecipitates, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/F-12 nutrient 1:1, Invitrogen, Milano, Italy) containing 100 U of penicillin G/mL and 100 µg of streptomycin sulfate/mL and the indicated concentrations of tested ligands or vehicle (0.1% ethanol). After 20 h, cells were harvested and luciferase and -galactosidase activities were measured as described.16 All transfection experiments were repeated at least three times. EC50 values for all tested ligands were calculated by using

GraphPad Prism, version 5.0a, for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, www.graphpad.com). Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization. The LBD of PPAR was expressed as N-terminal His-tagged protein using a pET28 vector and purified as previously described.27 Crystals of apo-PPAR were obtained by vapor diffusion at 20 °C using the sitting drop made by mixing 2 µL of protein solution (15 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris, DTT 5 mM, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 2 µL of reservoir solution (0.8 M Na citrate, 0.15 mM Tris, pH 8.0). The crystals were soaked for 3 days in a storage solution (1.2 M Na citrate, 0.15 M Tris, pH 8.0) containing the ligands (0.5 mM). The ligands dissolved in ethanol were diluted in the storage solution so that the final ethanol concentration was 1%. The storage solution with glycerol 20% (v/v) was used as cryoprotectant. Crystals of PPAR/(S)-1, PPAR/(R)-1, and PPAR/(S)-2 all belong to the space group C2 with cell parameters shown in Table 1. The asymmetric unit is formed by one homodimer (53.5% solvent for all complexes). Structure Determination. X-ray data were collected at 100 K under a nitrogen stream using synchrotron radiation (beamline XRD1 at Elettra, Trieste, Italy, for the complex PPAR/(S)-1; beamline ID14-1 at ESRF, Grenoble, France, for the other complexes). The diffracted intensities were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK29 for the complex PPAR/ (S)-1 and using MOSFLM and SCALA30 for the other complexes. Refinements were performed with CNS31 using the coordinates of apo-PPAR32 (PDB code 1PRG) as a starting model. All data between 8 and 2.6 Å were included for PPAR/(S)-1 (between 8 and 2.4 Å for PPAR/(R)-1; between 8 and 2.4 Å for PPAR/(S)2). The statistics of crystallographic data and refinement are summarized in Table 1. The coordinates of PPAR/(S)-1, PPAR/ (R)-1, and PPAR/(S)-2 complexes have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the codes 3B3K, 3D6D, and 3CDS, respectively. Computational Chemistry. Molecular modeling and graphics manipulations were performed using the molecular operating environment (MOE)33 running on a 2 CPU (PIV 2.0-3.0 GHz) Linux workstation. Energy minimizations were realized by employing the AMBER 9 program,34 selecting the parm99 force field.35 Model building and geometry optimizations of (S)-1 enantiomer were accomplished with the MMFF94X force field, available within MOE. The carboxylate group was taken as dissociated. The coordinates of PPARR in the complex with the R/ dual agonist BSM631707 (PDB code 2REW)24 were used in the docking experiments. Bound ligand and water molecules were removed. A correct atom assignment for N, Q, and H residues was done, and hydrogen atoms were added using standard MOE geometries. Partial atomic charges were computed by MOE using the AMBER99 force field. All heavy atoms were then fixed, and hydrogen atoms were minimized using the AMBER99 force field and a constant dielectric of 1, terminating at a gradient of 0.001 kcal mol-1 Å-1. Enantiomer (S)-1 was docked into the active site of PPARR using the GOLD 3.2 program,36 computing interaction energies within a sphere of a 18 Å radius centered on the OH atom of Y464 in the PPARR structure. The poses obtained with the original Goldscore function are rescored and reranked with the GOLD implementation of the CHEMscore function. To perform a thorough and unbiased search of the conformation space, each docking run was allowed to produce 30 poses without the option of early termination, using standard default settings. In this docking run, the 30 poses produced by GOLD resulted in only one cluster on the basis of their conformations. The top solution (CHEMscore fitness ) 41.2 kJ/ mol) obtained after reranking of the poses with CHEMscore was selected to generate the PPARR/(S)-1 complex. To eliminate any residual geometric strain, the obtained complex was energy-minimized for 5000 steps using combined steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods until a convergence value of 0.001 kcal/(mol Å). Upon minimization, the protein backbone atoms were held fixed. The geometry optimization was performed using the SANDER module in the AMBER suite of programs, employing the Cornell et al. force field to assign parameters for

the standard amino acids. General AMBER force field (GAFF) parameters were assigned to ligands, while the partial charges were calculated using the AM1-BCC method as implemented in the ANTECHAMBER suite of AMBER. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of PPAR/(S)-1 and PPARR/(S)-1 were carried out in aqueous solution according to the following protocol. The complexes were put at the center of a box of 7.2 × 7.6 × 7.6 nm3 volume. As starting structures, we considered the complex formed by docking (S)-1 into the PPARR-LBD, and the crystal complex of PPAR/(S)-1. The box was then filled with 11 476 Single Point Charges37 water molecules to reproduce the typical liquid density. The electrical neutrality of the systems was ensured by adding the proper number of positive (Na+) counterions, i.e., seven for PPAR/(S)-1 and two for PPARR/(S)-1. The same conditions were applied for simulating apo-PPAR and apoPPARR. All the simulations were initiated with a steepest descent optimization and solvent relaxation. Subsequently, a slow heating from 10 to 300 K was performed using short simulations of 50.0 ps. The simulations were then propagated for 13 ns in a NVT ensemble using an integration step of 2.0 fs with the rototranslational constraint applied to the solute.38 The temperature was kept constant by the isokinetic temperature coupling,39 and all bond lengths were constrained by adopting the LINCS algorithm.40 Long range electrostatics was computed by the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method,41 with 34 wave vectors in each dimension and a fourth-order cubic interpolation. The Gromos force field42 was used for the protein, at neutral pH, and for (S)-1. The point charges of the latter were calculated with a standard fitting scheme43 carried out on density functional theory calculations using the Becke3LYP functional44 with 6-311+g(d) basis set using the Gaussian 03 package.45 The Gromacs software46 was employed for all the MD runs. Statistical evaluations on selected observables were calculated by dividing the trajectory in two subparts and reporting the semidispersion around the average value.
