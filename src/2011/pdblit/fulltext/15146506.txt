Introduction. The mycoplasmas form a large group of prokaryotic microorganisms with over 190 species distinguished from ordinary bacteria by their small size, minute genome, and total lack of a cell wall. These diverse organisms are parasites for a wide range of hosts including humans, animals, insects, plants, and cells grown in tissue culture. Moreover, mycoplasmas are believed to have yielded to selective pressure to reduce genome size and only contain a limited gene set. The species with the smallest genome size in this class is Mycoplasma genitalium which contains only 479 predicted protein coding sequences (genes) and represents a minimal gene set for a living organism. As an ongoing project, the Berkeley Structural Genomics Center pursues an integrated structural genomics program designed to obtain a near-complete structural complement of two minimal genomes, M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae (http://www.strgen.org). Hundreds of targets have been selected based on no or low sequence similarity with proteins of known three-dimensional structure, and among them, about half of these targets are functionally uncharacterized proteins, namely hypothetical proteins. MG027 (gi number 3844637) is one of the targets from M. genitalium which was annotated as conserved hypothetical protein. (http://www.strgen.org/status/ mptargets.html). We have determined the crystal structure of this protein and found it is structurally homologous to the N-utilizing substance B (NusB) proteins despite a low sequence identity between them. NusB plays a role in antitermination processes. The bacteriophage RNA sequences called nut, consisting of boxA and boxB motifs, nucleate the assembly of the N protein, the host-encoded Nus proteins, NusA, NusB, NusG, and NusE/S10, and the RNAP into terminationresistant complexes.1,2 NusB and NusE form a heterodimer that specifically binds to boxA and enhances antitermination.3,4 NusB also competes with a cellular inhibitor that binds to boxA and prevents antitermination.5 The structures are known for NusB proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mt-NusB) and E. coli.6,7 Unlike other RNA binding proteins, NusB shows a unique structure of all -helical fold. More interestingly, the solution structure of nusB from E. coli is a monomer, but

mt-NusB is a dimer both in crystal and in solution. Here we report the monomeric crystal structure of MG027, a structural homolog of nusB protein from M. genitalium to 2.0 Å resolution. Materials and Methods. Protein production: The MG027 gene from M. genitalium was amplified by PCR using Mycoplasma genitalium genomic DNA template and inserted into pLR1 expression vector, having a Maltose Binding Protein (MBP)-Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) sites as an N-terminal fusion and 6-His as a C-terminal fusion. Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pSJS1244 Star8 upon induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside. Selenomethionyl (SeMet) protein was prepared according to the method of Doublie.9 For protein purification, 60 g of cell paste were resuspended in 250 ml 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5 and lysed by sonication. In a first purification step, NaCl concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 300 mM before loading of the His-MBP-tagged target protein onto a cobalt affinity column (Talon resin, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The target protein was eluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole. To remove fused MBP, the eluted protein solution was mixed with 0.66 mg mTEV and dialysed into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT at 4°C (Buffer A) overnight. For further purification to remove MBP, the protein solution was then loaded onto a 5 ml HiTrapQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in buffer A from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in 20 column volumes. The target protein was in the flowthrough fraction and was concentrated to 30 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. The concentrated protein was then applied on a

Superdex 75 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The peak fractions were then concentrated to 20 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl for crystallization. The homogeneity of the protein was assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using DynaPro99 DLS machine (Protein Solutions, NJ). Crystallization: Screening was done by the sparse matrix screening method.10 Optimum conditions were obtained by mixing 1 l protein solution (22 mg/ml) with 1 l reservoir solution containing 0.2 M sodium iodide, 20% PEG 3350 and equilibrated over 1 ml of reservoir solution. Large rod shape crystals were obtained within 2­3 days at 4°C. Derivative soaking: For the mercury derivative, crystals were transferred to reservoir solution saturated with methyl mercury chloride at 4°C and soaked for 1 week. The soaked crystals were then transferred back to reservoir solution and de-soaked for 2 hours to remove the nonspecifically bound methyl mercury chloride before freezing. Data collection: For data collection, crystals were transferred to the reservoir solution plus 5% ethylene glycol for approximately 5 minutes, and the concentration of ethylene glycol was then increased to 20% step by step (5% increase and 5 minute soaking time per step) before crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) Beamline 5.0.2 (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley) at 100°K with a Quantum 4 charge-coupled device (CCD) detector and processed with HKL 2000.11 Data statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure solution and Refinement: The positions of 1 Hg site and 1 selenium site were identified using SOLVE12 from a combined set of the multiple-wavelength anoma-

lous dispersion (MAD) data and the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) data. Initial phases were greatly improved by density modification (CCP4 suite13 program). For each monomer, 132 of the 151 amino acids were built into the resultant maps using the program O14 by using the selenium and Hg sites as guides. No density was visible for the first 11 N-terminal amino acids and part of the loop region that connects -helix 4 (H4) and -helix 5 (H5) (residue 89 ­96, Fig. 1). Refinement of the initial model was performed with the program CNS15 using the peak data with phase-restraints. Three runs of manual rebuilding were performed using sigmaA-weighted 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc maps and Ramachandran analysis as guides. The final refinement was done with the TLS program in CCP413 suite followed by 2 runs of manual model rebuilding and addition of water molecules. A total of 61 water molecules were added to the final model. Seven iodide ions (100 mM NaI is present in crystallization condition) were built into the model according to the anomalous difference Fourier map

and sigmaA-weighted Fo­Fc electron density map. PROCHECK13 analysis shows that the model has good overall geometry, with 88% residues in the most favored regions and no residues falling in disallowed region of Ramachandran space (Table I). Results and Discussion. Structure: We determined the crystal structure of MG027 protein from M. genitalium to 2.0 Å resolution using the MAD­SIRAS combined technique (Table I). In the crystal, there is one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the monomer consists of 6 -helices (H1 to H6), a long loop that connects H4 and H5, and a C-terminal loop region with overall dimension of 30 Å 27 Å 46 Å (Fig. 1). In the overall structure, -helix H1 is sandwiched by a pair of antiparallel helices (H2 and H3), a connecting -helix (H4) and a 2-helix bundle (H5 and H6), forming a hydrophobic core. Structural similarity: A structural similarity search, performed by the DALI16 server, with the coordinates of this protein indicates that the protein is structurally similar to NusB protein [Z score 13.3, Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 1eyv] with RMSD values of 2.5 Å for the superposition of 116 C atoms. The structural comparison between MG027 and nusB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mt-nusB) showed that the overall topology of MG027 is very similar to the mt-nusB structure (Fig. 2). The core structure formed by H1, H3, H4, H5, H6 is well conserved. In the MG027 structure, the -helix H2 is shorter and the upper helix that connects with -helix H1 is moved further apart from H1. This difference may be due to the sequence heterogeneity between different organisms (See Figure 3). In MG027, the loop region (between residue 78 to 99) that connects H4 and H5 is much longer than the corresponding loop in mt-nusB (between residue 76 to 86) and other nusB proteins (Fig. 3). This loop is mostly exposed in the solvent region and is disordered in MG027 structure. The biggest difference between these two structures comes from the C-terminal region. In mt-nusB structure the C-terminal region is an -helix while in MG027 structure it is a loop region. This difference could be accounted to the sequence diversity. Functional implication and discussion: MG027 is a possible member of NusB family: The target protein MG027 was annotated as conserved hypothetical protein. Neither PSI-BLAST formatted search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) nor Pfam (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/ Pfam/search.shtml) search with the sequence of MG027 identified it as a member of the nusB family. PSI-BLAST conserved domain search showed that MG027 contains a conserved domain of NusB protein, but some regions of MG027 sequence are not correctly aligned to NusB family protein sequences due to the lack of structural information. The crystal structure of MG027 clearly shows it has the same kind of structural fold as nusB proteins. A structure-based multiple sequence alignment between them suggests that MG027 can be well aligned to members of the NusB family in both sequence and secondary structural level (Fig. 3). The sequence identity and similarity between MG027 and mt-NusB are 14% and 35% over equivalent positions, respectively. The sequence align-

ment results also indicate that some highly conserved and functionally important residues are also well conserved in MG027, such as residues R14, R18, F26 (Fig. 3). R14 and R18 are located in the basic N-terminal region of NusB proteins and well conserved in NusB family. The NMR data from the structure determination of E. coli NusB suggest that this basic N-terminal region contacts the rRNA BoxA.17 This basic region is also proposed to contain the so-called arginine rich RNA binding motif (ARM).17 In the crystal structure of mt-NusB, R14 and R18 are found to form hydrogen bonds to a phosphate ion.6 In the MG027 structure, these two residues are well defined and located in a similar position as in mt-NusB structure. Another highly conserved and probably functionally important residue is F26. In E. coli, mutation of this residue (Y in E. coli) to aspartate abolishes antitermination of the native complex.18,19 In the structure of MG027, this residue is well defined and is pointing towards the solvent region (data not shown), indicating that F26 may be involved in protein­protein or protein­RNA interactions. Based on the data of structural and sequence conservation between MG027 and NusB protein, we propose that MG027 is a member of the NusB family. MG027 is a monomer. In E. coli, nusB forms a homodimer with NusE (identical to S10 protein) and mediates transcriptional antitermination process. The detailed molecular mechanism of how this complex is assembled is not understood. Recently two NusB structures have been published. One is the crystal structure of nusB from M. tuberculosis where the nusB protein is a dimer in both crystal packing and in solution.6 Another is the solution structure of nusB from E. coli in which the nusB protein is a monomer in solution.7 For MG027 protein, both gel filtration and DLS results suggest it is a monomer (data not shown). MG027 also exists as a monomer in the crystal. Both M. genitalium and M. tuberculosis belong to Gram positive eubacteria, but M. genitalium belongs to the subdivision with low G C content, whereas M. tuberculosis belongs to the subdivision with high G C content and slow growing species. It is possible that the dimerization of mt-NusB is organism-specific. Antitermination mechanism in M. genitalium. Since Mycoplasma genitalium is considered to be the simplest living organism in nature and carries only minimal numbers of genes indispensable for growth, the antitermination mechanism study in this organism may provide a prototype model for all prokaryotic organisms. Currently, the detailed molecular antitermination mechanism in M. genitalium is not clear. According to the current transcription antitermination model, the essential components for forming a highly effective antitermination complex include RNAP, boxA, boxB sequence, Nus proteins including NusA, NusB, NusE/S10, NusG.20 So far, several homologs of these components have been detected in the M. genitalium genome. They include the homolog of RNAP protein (MG177, core subunit; MT022, subunit; MG249, sigma70 factor; MG340, subunit), homolog of NusA protein (MG141), homolog of NusE protein (identical to S10, MG150), homolog of NusG protein (MG054) (http://

So far, there is no report about boxB sequence in M. genitalium genome. Future work in finding the boxB-like sequence in Mycoplasma genitalium genome will certainly help better understanding of the antitermination mechanism in this minimal organism. Acknowledgments.
