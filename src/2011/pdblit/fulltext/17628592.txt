Intracellular binding proteins can be applied as research tools for target validation and study of protein function in cells and potentially as therapeutics. The success of intracellular binding reagents depends on their affinity and specificity for target molecules, although their stability and functionality in the intracellular environment actually determine their usefulness for such application. Alternative binding proteins derived from scaffolds devoid of disulfide bonds are well suited for intracellular use, as their folding and stability are usually not impaired under reducing conditions. Here, we describe the generation of intracellular binding reagents called Affilin, based on the human B-crystallin scaffold. The target was human papillomavirus E7 protein implicated in the development of cervical cancer. E7 binders were selected from the combinatorial Bcrystallin library by conventional phage display technique. Affilin variants specifically bound the E7 protein with affinities in the nanomolar range. Intracellular expression of Affilin molecules in E7-positive cells led to inhibition of cellular proliferation. The effect was specific, as the growth of E7-negative cells or cells expressing the wild-type B-crystallin scaffold remained unaffected. These results demonstrate that the B-crystallin scaffold allows the de novo generation of alternative binding proteins, which are suitable for intracellular applications as they retain their functionality in the reducing environment of mammalian cells.

Introduction
Monoclonal antibodies are the best-characterized binding molecules that are extensively used for various biotechnological and medical applications. However, due to certain limitations of antibodies associated with their large size and complex structure, reliable alternatives based on smaller antibody formats, as well as protein scaffolds beyond the immunoglobulin family, have been developed to address some of these issues.1,2 In recent years, numerous protein scaffolds derived from different structural families have been employed for the generation of alternative binding proteins.3,4 Such novel affinity reagents are usually obtained in vitro from combinatorial protein libraries using various selection technologies, mainly phage display and ribosome display.5≠7 Designed binding proteins

selected to recognize predefined targets such as low-molecular-weight compounds, peptides, and proteins have been already shown to achieve specificities and affinities comparable to those of conventional antibodies.8 In addition to the specificities for different kinds of targets, these proteins provide several benefits such as robustness, ease of modification, and cost-efficient production. This makes alternative binding proteins interesting not only as research and diagnostic tools but also as potential therapeutics.9,10 For intracellular applications, alternative binding proteins offer another advantage over the conventional antibody-based approach. The high thermodynamic stability of these proteins, which does not rely on the presence of disulfide bonds, enables their efficient folding and functionality under reducing conditions within cells. From approximately 50 proteins proposed as scaffolds to this day,11 very few have been developed for intracellular use. They include designed ankyrin repeat proteins,12≠14 binders based on the thioredoxin scaffold,15 as well as mutants of the PDZ domain derived from the serine protease Omi.16 Binding molecules based on these scaffolds have been shown to fully retain their functionality, being able to modulate protein function in an intracellular context. Affilin molecules represent a novel class of alternative binding proteins that exploit side chains of the rigid -sheet structure of the human B-crystallin for molecular recognition.17 B-Crystallin is a member of the -crystallin superfamily of structural proteins of the vertebrate eye lens.18 As an exclusively structural protein, B-crystallin does not possess any known binding or enzymatic activity of its own.18 A universal binding site has been generated by the randomization of eight surface-exposed amino acids located in the first, second, and fourth -strands of the human B-crystallin (Fig. 1).17 The resulting Bcrystallin library has been used for the phage display selection of first-generation Affilin molecules against varied targets such as proteins [Fc fragment of human immunoglobulin G (IgG-Fc) and proform of human nerve growth factor (proNGF)], as well as small molecules such as the steroid hormones estradiol and testosterone.17 Isolated Affilin variants have been shown to preserve the high thermodynamic stability of the parental B-crystallin scaffold with no major structural changes introduced by amino acid substitutions.17 As the intrinsic stability of B-crystallin does not rely on the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds, 19 we were interested to learn whether binding proteins designed on the basis of this scaffold could be used for intracellular applications. For the purpose of our study, we have chosen the E7 protein encoded by human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 as a target molecule. Specific high-risk-type HPVs (mainly HPV-16 and HPV-18) are etiologically linked to cervical cancer.20 The two viral proteins E6 and E7 cooperate, each with a separate role, to induce and maintain the

Human Bcrystallin consists of two highly symmetrical domains with an overall -sheet structure connected by a short linker peptide (amino acid residues 82≠87). The eight amino acid positions (i.e., Lys2, Thr4, Tyr6, Ser15, Glu17, Thr19, Arg36, and Glu38) located within the first, second, and fourth -strands of the N-terminal domain of the human B-crystallin subjected to random mutagenesis are highlighted in green with their original side chains.

transformed phenotype of HPV-infected cells.21 These viral proteins bind, inactivate, and alter the activity of several proteins involved in the control of cell growth, apoptosis, and chromosomal stability.22,23 The transforming activity of the E7 protein is associated with its ability to bind to the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor protein (pRb) and, consequently, to destabilize pRb-E2F repressor complexes, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.24,25 E7 also interacts with and inactivates other pRb family members such as p107 and p130.26,27 Inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p2128 and p27,29 as well as direct activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 230 by E7, also facilitates S-phase entry and progression. Furthermore, E7 protein influences the activity of other cell cycle regulators (reviewed by Longworth and Laimins31 and Munger et al.32), and these interactions contribute to the growthstimulating and growth-transforming properties of E7 protein as well.33 Numerous studies have demonstrated that E7 inhibition induces growth arrest34,35 or apoptosis36,37 in cervical cancer cells. In this study, we aimed to isolate artificial inhibitors of the E7 protein transforming activity. For this purpose, we performed a phage display selection of anti-E7 Affilin molecules from a B-crystallin protein library. Two selected Affilin molecules bound the E7 protein with affinities in the nanomolar range. Following expression in E7-positive mammalian cells, selected Affilin molecules were able to inhibit cellular growth. The effect was specific, as confirmed in control experiments with E7-negative cells or cells expressing the wild-type B-crystallin scaffold.

conditions using immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) in a microtiter plate format. From 96 individual Affilin variants, 32 clones showed specific binding to the E7 target protein, as compared to binding to bovine serum albumin (BSA) (specific/unspecific binding ratio N5; data not shown). On the basis of ELISA screening, 20 clones showing the highest signal were selected for sequencing. Sequence analysis of Affilin molecules Sequence analysis resulted in seven different sequences of Affilin molecules being confirmed by concentration-dependent ELISA experiments to bind the target protein (see the text below). The identification of amino acid exchanges at randomized positions (Table 1) revealed a preference for certain amino acid substitutions, although a consensus sequence was not apparent. Positions 2 and 4 were frequently occupied by hydrophobic amino acids, which could mediate binding to the target protein via hydrophobic interactions. As compared to the input B-crystallin library, two Affilin molecules, termed D1≠14 and D4≠14, showed enrichment of basic amino acids at randomized positions. Examination of the overall electrostatic potentials of D1≠14 and D4≠14 revealed the presence of basic patches, which are particularly noticeable on the surface of the D1≠14 variant, as compared to the surface charge distribution of the B-crystallin scaffold (Fig. 2). Considering the acidic nature of HPV-16 E7 [isoelectric point (pI) deduced from the amino acid sequence of His6-tagged E7 = 4.7], this might indicate that electrostatic interactions contributed to the E7 binding as well. The amber stop codon encoding a Gln residue in the supE E. coli strain was found in some of the sequences. The parental wild-type B-crystallin sequence was not found among the sequenced clones. The seven clones were analyzed further regarding their binding affinity for E7. Expression and purification of Affilin molecules Since Affilin molecules were additionally intended to be used for Tat-mediated delivery (data not

Our results demonstrate that Affilin molecules retain their functionality in the reducing environment of mammalian cells, making these alternative binding proteins a promising tool for intracellular applications such as target discovery or, eventually, intracellular therapy.

Results
Selection of anti-E7 Affilin molecules from a B-crystallin phage display library The library used for the selection of Affilin molecules that are able to bind to the HPV-16 E7 protein contained  4.5 ◊ 108 independent B-crystallin variants and was prepared as described.17 To identify anti-E7 Affilin molecules, we performed three standard phage display selection rounds on recombinant E7 protein immobilized on microtiter plates (for details, see Materials and Methods). Following the third selection round, the DNA encoding a selected pool of binders was subcloned into the cytoplasmic expression vector pET-20b(+), and 96 randomly picked clones were prescreened regarding their binding to the E7 protein and specificity by ELISA. For this purpose, the His6tagged Affilin variants were expressed in Escherichia coli NovaBlue(DE3) cells and purified under native

shown), proteins were produced as C-terminal fusions to the His6-tag, followed by a 13-aminoacid Tat peptide (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ).38 It has been confirmed that the C-terminal fusion does not influence the in vitro binding affinity of Affilin molecules for the E7 target protein (data not shown). Expression was performed using E. coli BL21(DE3)CodonPlus-RIL cells or E. coli NovaBlue (DE3) cells (variants containing amber stop codon) under shaker flask conditions (1.5 l). The proteins were purified from the soluble fraction by IMAC, followed by ion-exchange chromatography on the HiTrap SP HP column. The wild-type B-crystallin was prepared accordingly. The yield of protein preparation for individual clones varied between 2 and 18 mg from 1 l of culture. As estimated by SDSPAGE, the protein preparation was more than 95% pure (for the Affilin variant D1≠14 exemplified in Fig. 3). In vitro characteristics of Affilin molecules To evaluate the binding affinity of anti-E7 Affilin molecules, we performed a concentration-dependent ELISA experiment using recombinant HPV-16 E7 protein as target. Apparent dissociation constant (Kd) values were calculated as described in Materials and Methods. The selected Affilin variants bound E7 with Kd in the micromolar to nanomolar range (Table 2). The variants D1≠14 and D4≠14 revealed the highest affinity for the E7 protein, with Kd  70 nM and Kd  270 nM, respectively (Fig. 4). These Affilin clones were selected for further characterization. Specificity was evaluated in an ELISA experiment in which the binding of D1≠14 and D4≠14 to E7 was compared to the binding to several unrelated proteins such as amyloglucosidase, trypsin inhibitor, BSA, human serum albumin (HSA), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF), IgG-Fc, melanoma-inhibitory activity (MIA) protein, NGF, ubiquitin, and lysozyme. These proteins were chosen to span a range of pI from 3.6 (amyloglucosidase) to 11

(lysozyme). Both Affilin molecules bound specifically to the E7 protein, as no significant binding could be detected for other proteins tested (Fig. 5). The lack of appreciable association with proteins of acidic pI (i.e., amyloglucosidase and trypsin inhibitor exhibiting pI values of 3.6 and 4.6, respectively) suggests that the contribution of electrostatic interactions is a specific determinant of the binding of Affilin molecules to E7. As expected, the wildtype B-crystallin evaluated under identical experimental conditions failed to bind any of the tested proteins (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5. Specificity analysis of selected Affilin molecules. The purified Affilin molecules D1≠14 and D4≠14, and wild-type B-crystallin were analyzed for their binding to different proteins: E7, amyloglucosidase (AM), trypsin inhibitor (TI), BSA, HSA, TNF, IgG-Fc (IgG), MIA protein, NGF, ubiquitin (Ubi), and lysozyme (Lys). The pI values of control proteins span a range from 3.6 (amyloglucosidase) to 11 (lysozyme). The proteins were immobilized on wells of a microtiter plate. Bound Affilin molecules were detected by an anti-B-crystallin antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Absorption values (A450) as the means of samples tested in triplicate are shown.

Affilin molecules D1≠14 and D4≠14 were further characterized by analytical size-exclusion chromatography on a TSK-Gel G2000SWXL column and compared to the wild-type B-crystallin. As shown in Fig. 6, both Affilin molecules, as well as wild-type B-crystallin, eluted as single peaks at the size expected for the monomer. Intracellular activity of Affilin molecules D1≠14 and D4≠14 in E7-positive mammalian cells Both E6 and E7 proteins have the capacity to immortalize primary human keratinocytes39,40 and are necessary for the malignant transformation of HPV-positive human cervical cancer cells. 41,42 These viral genes possess also proliferation-stimulating and proliferation-transforming activities in a number of cell lines such as rodent NIH/3T3 fibroblasts.43,44 To examine the potential of Affilin molecules D1≠14 and D4≠14 to repress the transforming activity of the E7 protein in the cell, we used two target cell lines: a recombinant NIH/3T3 cell line, which constitutively expresses HPV-16 E7 protein45 (referred to as NIH/3T3-E7), and a human cervical carcinoma Ca Ski cell line, which expresses E6 and E7 proteins from an integrated papillomavirus 16 genome.46,47 To evaluate the intracellular activity of Affilin molecules, we examined cell proliferation and apoptosis in both target cell lines. As E7 is a nuclear protein, 48 Affilin molecules were transiently expressed from the pCMV/myc/nuc vector carrying the C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) from the SV40 large T antigen (DPKKKRKV)3 and a c-myc epitope tag. The basic character of this fusion tag is

similar to that of Affilin molecules expressed in E. coli (see the text above). As Affilin variants containing a C-terminal His6-tag≠Tat fusion retained their in vitro binding properties, it has been assumed that NLS≠cmyc tag should not interfere with the E7-binding activity of Affilin variants in the cell as well. To determine whether the expression of Bcrystallin-related proteins in cells may, in itself, have an effect on cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, we expressed the wild-type B-crystallin protein from the same pCMV/myc/nuc vector and used it in all experiments as control. The expression and intracellular localization of Affilin variants and the wild-type B-crystallin protein were monitored by immunostaining using an anti-human B-crystallin antibody. This confirmed the predominantly nuclear distribution of proteins within cells (Fig. 7). Due to the relative low transfection efficiency of Ca Ski cells ( 5%), the proliferation rate of both target cell lines was determined at the single-cell level by an immunofluorescence analysis of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into DNA during the S-phase. This assay allowed elimination of the influence of transfection rate factor, as the numbers of Affilin-expressing and BrdU-positive cells per total number of transfected cells were determined for each sample. The cells were analyzed at 48 h posttransfection. As shown in Fig. 7, the number of proliferating NIH/3T3-E7 cells expressing D1≠14 and D4≠14 was reduced as compared to the number of cells expressing the wild-type B-crystallin. The reduction in the proliferation rate was  50% and  35% for D1≠14 and D4≠14, respectively (Fig. 8). The same effect was observed following expression of the D1≠14 protein in Ca Ski cells, while inhibition of proliferation was less evident for the D4≠14 variant in this cell line (Figs. 7 and 8). To further validate the specificity of Affilininduced inhibition of proliferation, we examined the effect of the expression of Affilin molecules on

The cells were transiently transfected with vectors for the expression of indicated Affilin molecules or B-crystallin.

the proliferation of control cell lines: wild-type NIH/ 3T3, human cervical carcinoma C-33 A cell line negative for HPV,46 and human HEK293 cell line. The cells were analyzed under the same experimental conditions as E7-positive cells. The expression pattern of Affilin molecules and B-crystallin in NIH/3T3, C-33 A, and HEK293 cells was identical to that obtained for E7-positive cells (Fig. 7). However, the proliferation rate of control cells was essentially unaffected by intracellular expression of Affilin molecules, indicating that the cell cycle arrest induced by Affilin molecules was restricted exclusively to E7-positive cells (Figs. 7 and 8). To further characterize an effect of Affilin expression on the phenotype of E7-positive cells, we also measured apoptotic cell death at the single-cell level. We observed only a slight increase in the number of apoptotic cells in case of NIH/3T3-E7 cells expressing D1≠14 and D4≠14 variants as compared to cells expressing wild-type B-crystallin. The occurrence of apoptosis in Ca Ski cells following transfection with Affilin D1≠14 and D4≠14 constructs remained unchanged (Fig. 9). Taken together, these results indicate that intracellular expression of Affilin molecules in E7positive cells leads to specific inhibition of cellular proliferation.

a suitable model for evaluation of the intracellular activity of Affilin molecules. Artificial binders of E7 based on the B-crystallin scaffold were successfully selected from the corresponding protein library by the phage display technique. Similarly to the first-generation Affilin molecules reported previously,17 E7 binders exhibited affinities in the micromolar to nanomolar range (Table 2). Considering the relatively small size of the B-crystallin library (4.5 ◊ 108 members)17 and the fact that Affilin molecules were selected from a primary screen without further maturation, these affinities were quite high. In case of intracellular binding reagents, their in vitro binding affinity is certainly an important feature. However, the stability and intrinsic folding capacity of the protein in the complex milieu in the cell actually determine the ability of such an affinity reagent to bind and inhibit its target in the intracellular context. Affilin molecules selected so far have been shown to preserve favorable biophysical properties inherent to the B-crystallin scaffold.17 This allows Affilin molecules to be expressed in the E. coli cytosol and to be efficiently purified from the soluble fraction. For anti-E7 Affilin molecules, yields of up to 18 mg of pure protein from 1 l of shaker flask culture were achieved. Selected anti-E7 Affilin molecules analyzed by gel filtration were monomeric, as only single peaks at the elution volume expected for the monomer were observed (Fig. 6). These Affilin molecules specifically bound the E7 target and did not cross-react with other proteins tested in ELISA, even with those exhibiting an acidic pI similar to that of E7 (Fig. 5). The interaction of Affilin molecules with E7 from other HPV types was not tested. As E7 proteins from different HPV types share a sequence homology,50 it would be challenging to attempt selection of Affilin variants recognizing certain conserved E7 epitopes. Such E7

Discussion
Papillomaviruses are a major cause of cervical cancer.49 Two viral proteins, E6 and E7, subvert pathways that control cell growth and apoptosis, leading to induction and maintenance of the transformed phenotype of HPV-infected cells.21 The transforming activity of E6 and E7 proteins is associated with inhibition and activation of several cell-cycle-regulatory proteins.22 As E7 is a protein distinct from those expressed in the cell, it provides

717 RNA.52≠54 In an approach similar to ours, intracellularly expressed single-chain variable antibody fragments (intrabodies) selected against HPV-16 E7 protein were shown to induce an antiproliferative effect in HPV-positive cells.35 In contrast to Affilin molecules, the representative antibody fragments revealed reduced stability, as their expression in bacterial periplasm and in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells was impaired.35 In summary, our results show that the B-crystallin library is applicable for the selection of Affilin variants with high affinity and specificity for a broad range of targets of different characteristics using conventional phage display approach. We assume that Affilin molecules retain their overall stability and functionality in the reducing environment of mammalian cells and thus are suitable for intracellular applications. Such alternative binding proteins could be used for neutralization of cellular protein functions associated with progression of several human diseases such as cancer, viral infections, or neurological disorders. However, the therapeutic application of intracellular binding reagents requires more efficient, specific, and safe methods for their delivery. As transfer of genetic material into mammalian cells in the laboratory can be easily achieved via standard transfection methods, alternative binding molecules can be already used for intracellular target validation, as well as for studies on protein function and protein≠protein interactions in cells.

binders could be possibly used for inhibiting the growth of other cells driven by HPV to proliferate. To suppress E7 protein function, we transiently expressed Affilin molecules in target mammalian cells and directed them to the nucleus. In our initial experiments, we used a model NIH/3T3-E7 cell line,45 which expresses only the E7 target protein. The expression of Affilin molecules D1≠14 and D4≠ 14 correlated with a reduction of the proliferation rate in transfected cells, as compared to cells expressing the wild-type B-crystallin scaffold. To further evaluate the growth-inhibitory effect of Affilin molecules in a cervical cancer cell model, we used the Ca Ski cell line, which expresses both E6 and E7 proteins from an integrated HPV genome.46,47 In these cells, intracellular expression of Affilin molecules led to growth inhibition as well. The Affilin variant D1≠14 reduced proliferation in the range of 50% in the population of both NIH/ 3T3-E7 and Ca Ski cells, whereas Affilin D4≠14 caused less pronounced antiproliferative effects in both investigated cell lines. Although the reason for this difference has not been established, it may reflect better folding capacity and overall stability of the D1≠14 variant in the intracellular environment of mammalian cells. The higher binding affinity of the Affilin D1≠14, although increased only by about fourfold as compared to D4≠14, could also contribute to a more pronounced antiproliferative effect observed for this variant. It is also possible that each Affilin variant recognizes a different binding epitope on the surface of the E7 protein, leading to different degrees of target neutralization. The fact that E7 is a multifunctional protein32 supports this hypothesis. For knowledge on intermolecular contacts occurring between these two Affilin molecules and the E7 target protein, further mutational and structural studies would be required. We confirmed the specificity of Affilin-mediated inhibition of cellular proliferation using control cell lines that are negative for HPV: wild-type NIH/ 3T3, cervical carcinoma C-33 A,46 and nonrelated HEK293. We also expressed the wild-type Bcrystallin scaffold in all investigated cell lines. In our control experiments, we did not observe any significant changes in the proliferation rate. Thus, we ascribe the antiproliferative effect observed for Affilin molecules D1≠14 and D4≠14 to be specific for E7-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 7, Affilin molecules expressed in E7-positive cells appeared in the nucleus, which is where E7 protein localization has been reported.48,51 This suggests a direct interaction of Affilin molecules with this target protein, leading to the inhibition of E7 transforming activity, although the mechanism by which Affilin molecules achieve the antiproliferative effect has not been elucidated. The idea that the specific inhibition of E7 protein leads to growth inhibition is supported by the findings of several other studies on the malignant transformation of HPV-infected cells. Such a phenotype has been observed following the targeting of HPV transcripts by ribozymes, antisense RNA, and small interfering

Materials and Methods
Affilin selection by phage display The generation of the phage display library based on the B-crystallin protein scaffold has been described previously.17 The recombinant HPV-16 E7 protein containing a C-terminal His6-tag was expressed and purified from E. coli, as described previously.55 The E7 target protein was directly immobilized on the microtiter plate (cat. no. 260836; Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) by incubation of 2 g/ml protein solution (100 l/well) overnight at 4 ∞C. The selection of anti-E7 Affilin molecules was achieved by performing three conventional phage display selection rounds, as described previously.17 Screening of single clones and nucleotide sequence analysis The DNA pool encoding anti-E7 Affilin molecules derived from the third selection round was subcloned into the pET-20b(+) vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), yielding a construct with a C-terminal His6-tag. The E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) strain (Novagen) was used for the soluble expression of 96 individual clones in a microtiter plate format. Expression of each clone was carried out in 4 ml of 2◊ YT medium by induction with 1 mM IPTG when the optical density of cultures at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6. Following overnight incubation at 30 ∞C, the cells were lysed using BugBuster 10◊ Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen) and purified from the crude lysate using the QIAexpress Ni-NTA Protein Purification System (Qiagen,

718
Hilden, Germany) in accordance with the supplier's manual. The purified Affilin molecules were screened for E7 binding by ELISA in a 96-well format. For this purpose, the proteins were transferred to a microtiter plate previously coated with recombinant HPV-16 E7 protein or BSA (2 g/ml, 100 l/well) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20, and Affilin molecules were detected using an antihuman B-crystallin antibody (Biogenes, Berlin, Germany) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a 1:1000 dilution at 37 ∞C for 1 h. After the plate had been washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, followed by an additional washing step with PBS, ELISA was developed using TMB Plus solution (Kem-En-Tec Diagnostic, Copenhagen, Denmark). The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.2 M H2SO4, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm (A450), with 620 nm as reference, using a Tecan Sunrise Absorbance Microplate Reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). The DNA sequence of positive clones was verified by dideoxy chain termination method using the CycleReader Auto DNA Sequencing Kit (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and a Li-Cor 4200 DNA sequencer (Li-Cor Bioscience, Bad Homburg, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant protein production For large-scale preparation of Affilin variants, the proteins were expressed from the pET-20b(+) vector modified to encode a 13-amino-acid Tat peptide (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ)38 preceded by a C-terminal His6tag. For Affilin variants containing amber stop codon, E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) cells (Novagen) were used, whereas remaining clones were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The human B-crystallin wild type was prepared likewise using BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL E. coli strain. The cells were grown in 1.5 l of 2◊ YT medium at 37 ∞C until the OD600 had reached 0.5 for D4≠14 and wild-type Bcrystallin, and 1.3 for D1≠14. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and carried out for 4 h at 30 ∞C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in NPI20 buffer [50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole (pH 8.0)]. After lysozyme treatment, the cells were disrupted by ultrasonication, and the suspension was centrifuged at 40,000g for 30 min. The supernatant containing the soluble protein fraction was loaded onto a HiTrap Chelating HP 5-ml column (Amersham Biosciences Europe, Freiburg, Germany), and the protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient from 20 to 500 mM in 20 column volumes. The fractions containing eluted protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 ∞C against SP-1 buffer [10 mM Hepes and 50 mM NaCl (pH 7.4)] and subsequently purified on a HiTrap SP HP 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences Europe). Bound protein was eluted with NaCl gradient from 50 to 1000 mM in 15 column volumes and subsequently dialyzed overnight at 4 ∞C against 10 mM Hepes buffer containing 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.4). Purified proteins were stored at 4 ∞C for short-term usage or frozen at -80 ∞C for prolonged storage. All purification steps were performed using the ƒKTA Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences Europe) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and carried out at room temperature. Protein fractions from expression and all purification steps were separated by SDS-PAGE in a gel containing 15% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide under reducing conditions

Affilin Molecules Inhibit Target Cell Proliferation in accordance with Laemmli,56 followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography For size-exclusion analysis, protein samples were injected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a TSK-Gel G2000SWXL column (Tosoh Bioscience, Stuttgart, Germany) controlled by a Dionex Summit HPLC system. Chromatography was run in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 300 mM NaCl (pH 6.0) and at a temperature of 25 ∞C. The column was calibrated using Low Molecular Weight Kit (Amersham Biosciences Europe). Protein elution was monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. ELISA The affinities and binding specificities of Affilin variants were determined using ELISA, as described for the screening of Affilin molecules. Various control proteins were purchased as follows: amyloglucosidase and trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Munich, Germany); BSA and HSA (Carl Roth GmbH and Co., Karlsruhe, Germany); TNF (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene, Rehovot, Israel); IgGFc (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany); MIA protein, NGF, and ubiquitin (Scil Proteins, Halle, Germany); and lysozyme (Merck Bioscience, Schwalbach/ Ts, Germany). The proteins were immobilized on a microtiter plate at a concentration of 2 g/ml (100 l/ well) overnight at 4 ∞C and subsequently blocked with BSA. For determination of affinities, sequentially diluted Affilin variants were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. For specificity analysis, Affilin variants and the wildtype human B-crystallin were added to the wells at a concentration of 300 nM and incubated for 1 h. For determination of apparent dissociation constant (Kd), the A450 values after reference subtraction were plotted against the Affilin concentration using the SigmaPlot 2000 software. The data were fitted by nonlinear regression to a hyperbolic function with the equation A = (Amaxc)/(Kd + c), where A = measured signal, Amax = signal for saturated binding, and c = protein concentration. Cell cultures and transfection Ca Ski (ATCC CRL-1550) and C-33 A (ATCC HTB-31) cervical carcinoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, whereas NIH/3T3 (ATCC CRL-1658), NIH/3T3E7 (a kind gift from W. Zwerschke, Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute at the Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria), and HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium. The culture medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. All cell culture reagents were purchased from PAA Laboratories (Cˆlbe, Germany). The Affilin variants and the wild-type B-crystallin were expressed from the pCMV/myc/nuc vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing three copies of the SV40 large T antigen NLS and a c-myc tag. Ca Ski cells were transiently transfected with the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. NIH/3T3 cells were transiently transfected using Nucleofector technology (Amaxa, Kˆln, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The C-33 A, NIH/ 3T3-E7, and HEK293 cell lines were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation.57,58

BrdU incorporation assay For analysis of cellular proliferation, the transfected cells seeded on cover slips in a 24-well plate were incubated for 4 h (NIH/3T3-E7, NIH/3T3, and HEK293) and for 10 h (Ca Ski and C-33 A) with 10 M BrdU (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and labeled with an anti-human B-crystallin mouse monoclonal antibody (Biogenes) and an antimouse Cy3-conjugated antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) both at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h. Postfixation was performed using 4% formaldehyde for 20 min. After DNA denaturation with 4 M HCl for 10 min and several washing steps with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100, BrdU was detected by a monoclonal rat antiBrdU antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at a 1:100 dilution for 8 h, followed by staining with an anti-rat Alexa488 antibody (Invitrogen) at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h. Counterstaining was performed by incubation of cells with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole at a concentration of 1 g/ml. At least 500 transfected cells showing double staining for B-crystallin and BrdU were counted for each independent experiment conducted in triplicate. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t test. Probability (P) values are given in the corresponding figure. Analysis of apoptosis Apoptosis was detected at 72 h posttransfection with the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit Fluorescein (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis Images were taken with a Nikon Eclipse F600 microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera and Lucia GF software.
