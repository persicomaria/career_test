The virulent properties of the common human and livestock pathogen Clostridium perfringens are attributable to a formidable battery of toxins. Among these are a number of large and highly modular carbohydrate-active enzymes, including the -toxin and sialidases, whose catalytic properties are consistent with degradation of the mucosal layer of the human gut, glycosaminoglycans, and other cellular glycans found throughout the body. The conservation of noncatalytic ancillary modules among these enzymes suggests they make significant contributions to the overall functionality of the toxins. Here, we describe the structural basis of an ultra-tight interaction (Ka 1.44 1011 M 1) between the X82 and dockerin modules, which are found throughout numerous C. perfringens carbohydrateactive enzymes. Extensive hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals contacts between the X82 and dockerin modules give rise to the observed high affinity. The -toxin dockerin module in this complex is positioned 180° relative to the orientation of the dockerin modules on the cohesin module surface within cellulolytic complexes. These observations represent a unique property of these clostridial toxins whereby they can associate into large, noncovalent multitoxin complexes that allow potentiation of the activities of the individual toxins by combining complementary toxin specificities.

ized in cellulolytic bacteria, where they mediate the enzyme assembly and cell-surface attachment of the cellulose-degrading complex termed the cellulosome through interactions with its cognate binding partner, a cohesin module (12­17). Recent structural characterization of the X82 module from CpGH84C (NagJ), a C. perfringens homolog of the -toxin, indicated that this module displays structural homology to the cellulolytic cohesin modules (18), leading to speculation that carbohydrateactive toxins can form complexes through X82­Doc interactions. To assess the potential number of such complexes, we identified putative X82 and Doc modules from five and four C. perfringens glycoside hydrolases, respectively, and characterized their binding properties, including determining the 1.6 Åresolution complex crystal structure of the CpGH84C X82 module and the found-in-various architectures (FIVAR)-Doc modular pair from the -toxin, and the 1.7 Å-resolution crystal structure of the isolated X82 module from the NanJ sialidase toxin. The ultra-high-affinity X82­Doc interaction results from extensive intermodular contacts between both Doc helices and the 9a-8-3-6-5 face of the X82 module. The relationship to the cellulolytic cohesin-Doc interactions and the implications of X82­Doc-mediated toxin complexes in C. perfringens pathogenesis are discussed. Results
Identification and Interaction of C. perfringens X82 and Dockerin Modules. In addition to the CpGH84C X82 module

lostridium perfringens is a ubiquitous, Gram-positive, sporeforming bacterium that is a major cause of gastroenteritis and gas gangrene in humans (1). This organism is a prolific producer of toxins, which are responsible for its virulence, and is classified into five biotypes (A­E) on the basis of strain-specific production of major toxins (2). Biotype A encompasses the myonecrotic or ``flesh-eating'' strains of C. perfringens and mainly produces the major -toxin, which has phospholipase C activity (1, 3). These strains are also notable for their genomic content of numerous open-reading frames that encode large and highly modular carbohydrate-active enzymes (4, 5), which are primarily glycoside hydrolases (6). Their apparent role in infection involves the degradation of complex glycans, including the mucosal layer of the human gut, which comprises a group of highly hydrated glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, found throughout the body, and other cellular glycans. The -toxin (hyaluronidase) (7) and ``large'' sialidases (NanI and NanJ) (8) are known toxins that fall into this class of enzyme and are thought to contribute to virulence through varying mechanisms, such as the uncapping of receptors for other toxins and/or destruction of tissue (1). The carbohydrate-active toxins are among the largest and most modular enzymes produced by C. perfringens (Fig. 1). The extensive modularity and the reoccurring appearance of various ancillary modules within these carbohydrate-active toxins suggest that these nonatalytic modules play a role in their function. In this context, carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) have been found in many of these enzymes and shown to mediate their attachment to host glycan targets (9, 10). The -toxin contains a dockerin (Doc)-like sequence at its C terminus, which comprises two conserved calcium-binding EF-hand loop sequences (11, 12). Doc modules have been extensively character12194 ­12199 PNAS August 26, 2008 vol. 105 no. 34

(CpGH84CX82) (18), through bioinformatic analyses we have identified putative X82 modules in four other C. perfringens glycoside hydrolases, including and the ``large-sialidase''-toxin NanJ (8), [Fig. 1 and supporting information (SI) Fig. S1 A]. Modules possessing two EF-hand calcium-binding loops that are similar in sequence to Doc modules, the biological ligands of cohesin modules in cellulolytic bacteria (12), occur in four C. perfringens carbohydrate-active enzymes (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1B), including the -toxin (7, 11). These observations led us to hypothesize that C. perfringens X82 and Doc modules, and by extension their associated enzymes, interact to form noncovalent complexes, in a manner similar to that seen in cellulolytic anaerobic bacteria (12, 14, 17). Such C. perfringens-associated complexes would allow the individual enzymes to function in concert to efficiently and rapidly degrade their target

substrates, which include the mucosal layer of the human gut, carbohydrates associated with the extracellular matrix, and cell surface components within the infected tissue. The binding ability and specificity of the five C. perfringens X82 modules and four C. perfringens Doc modules were qualitatively assessed in an ELISA-based assay (Fig. 2A) (19). Interactions involving three ( -toxin, CpGH2, CpGH95) of the four Doc modules and three (NanJ, CpGH31, CpGH84C, CpGH20) of the five X82 modules were identified. No binding was observed for the X82 modules from the family 3 and family 31 glycoside hydrolases (CpGH3 and CpGH31, respectively) and the Doc module from a family 31 glycoside hydrolase (CpGH31). For a more quantitative analysis of representative interacting C. perfringens Doc-X82 pairs, we selected the isolated CpGH84C (CpGH84CX82) and NanJ (NanJX82) X82 modules, and a tandem derivative comprising the third FIVAR module and the Doc module (FIVAR-Doc) from the -toxin for isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies (Fig. 2 B­D and Fig. S2). Although the interactions were too strong to accurately determine association constants (Ka) by ITC ( 109 M 1), both indicated 1:1 binding stoichiometries. The changes in enthalpy ( H) for the CpGH84CX82­FIVAR-Doc interaction could be accurately established at several different temperatures allowing the determination of the change in heat capacity ( Cp) to be assessed at 143.5 11.1 cal mol 1 K 1. The Ka value for this interaction was determined by DSC to be 2.05 109 M 1 at 88.9°C or 1.44 1011 M 1 at 37°C, when the experimentally determined Cp was used with the integrated form of the van't Hoff equation to extrapolate to physiological temperature.
Structural Insights into C. perfringens X82­Dockerin-Mediated Enzyme Complexes. To explore the molecular basis of the ultra-

high-affinity X82­FIVAR-Doc interaction, we examined the high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of the 1:1 CpGH84CX82­ FIVAR-Doc complex (Fig. 3), which was determined at 1.6 Å with Rwork and Rfree values of 20.5 and 26.4, respectively. CpGH84CX82 (Fig. 3, green) in complex with FIVAR-Doc has the expected -sandwich structure formed by nine strands in a jellyroll topology, with the two faces of the sandwich comprising strands 9a, 8, 3, 6, 5 (9a-8-3-6-5 face) and 9b, 1, 2, 7, 4 (9b-1­2-7­4 face) (18). Comparison of the CpGH84CX82 structure in the complex with isolated CpGH84CX82 (18) [backbone root mean square distance (rmsd) of 1.3 Å] illustrates that, similar to the cellulolytic cohesin modules (13, 16), the C. perfringens X82 modules undergo only a very slight conformational rearrangement on binding a Doc module.

C. perfringens X82­Dockerin Complex Interface. The X82­Doc interface involves both helices of the Doc module and the 9a-83-6-5 face of the X82 module, and comprises 3,974 Å2 of total occluded surface area. The ultrahigh affinity of this noncovalent interaction is derived from an extensive hydrogen-bonding network and nonpolar interactions between residues of the X82 and Doc modules (Fig. 4 and Table S1). To assess the conservation of molecular determinants associated with Doc recognition among the C. perfringens X82 modules, we also determined the x-ray crystal structure of the isolated NanJX82 module at 1.7 Å with Rwork and Rfree values of 21.6 and 25.7, respectively (residues 939­1081; Fig. 5A, salmon). Despite sharing only 33% amino acid sequence identity, comparison of the NanJX82 and CpGH84CX82 structures reveals very similar overall folds (backbone rmsd of 1.2 Å) with a well conserved Doc-binding surface (Fig. 5B), which explains the observed high affinity of NanJX82 for FIVAR-Doc (Fig. S2). Indeed, the binding-interface residues are well conserved among the three C. perfringens X82 modules that were demonstrated to be functional (Fig. S1). In contrast, these residues are poorly conserved in the CpGH3 and CpGH31 X82 modules, explaining their lack of affinity for the tested Doc modules. Likewise, the interface residues are highly conserved among the functional Doc modules, but not in the CpGH31 Doc module (Fig. S1). A functional role for these latter X82 and Doc modules remains to be determined.

BIOCHEMISTRY

The third FIVAR module (residues 1498­1577; Fig. 3, orange) of the -toxin FIVAR-Doc protein fragment comprises three helices (I: Lys-1499-Glu-1515; II: Gly-1528-Phe-1544; III: Glu1551-Leu-1571) arranged in a left-handed three-helix bundle. The C-terminal module (residues 1578­1628; Fig. 3, light blue) has a typical Doc fold with two antiparallel F-hand motifs separated by a 9-residue linker. The two F-hand motifs each possess a canonical EF-hand calcium-binding loop (I: Asp-1579-Asp-1590; II: Asp1607-Glu-1618) that binds calcium in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration, and an exiting helix (IV: Asp-1587-Asn-1597; V: Asp-1615-Asn-1628). The two helices form an exposed and flush face that constitutes the X82 recognition surface. An interface exists between the FIVAR and Doc modules of the -toxin. Residues Phe-1520, His-1526, Lys-1527, Arg-1567, Ser-1570, Leu-1571, and Ile-1573 of the FIVAR module contact Leu-1608, Asn-1609, Lys-1610, Tyr-1617, Phe-1621, Ile-1622, and His-1624 of the Doc module, which gives the modular pair an extended prolate conformation.

associated carbohydrate-active enzymes suggests that they contribute important functionalities to the overall effectiveness of these enzymes. Our identification of several Doc- and X82containing C. perfringens enzymes, including the -toxin and NanJ sialidase toxin, indicate that these modules fall into such a class of protein modules. Further, the biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization of the C. perfringens X82­Doc interaction presented here suggests a conserved role of these protein modules in mediating enzyme complex formation via their ultra-high affinity interaction. Doc modules are best known for their role in the cellulosome, a multienzyme complex produced by anaerobic bacteria to efficiently and synergistically degrade cellulose-based biomass (12, 14, 17). These calcium-binding modules interact with their cognate cohesin modules, allowing the integration of their covalently attached catalytic domains onto the cellulosome scaffold (type-I interaction) and cell-surface attachment (type-II interaction). Although they possess similar sequences, the cellulolytic Doc modules involved in these two processes (type-I vs. type-II) display a high degree of binding specificity, which arises from the number of nonpolar contacts and the extent of interaction between helix I of the Doc modules and their respective cohesin modules (13, 16). The C. perfringens X82­Doc interac12196 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0803154105

tion is reminiscent of the C. thermocellum type-II interaction, with substantial nonpolar character, and both Doc helices making direct contacts the X82 9a-8-3-6-5 face (13). However, the orientation of the -toxin Doc module on the surface of the X82 module is rotated 180° from the Doc position in the C. thermocellum native type-I (16) and type-II complexes (13) (Fig. 6). This orientation is similar to that of a C. thermocellum typeI Doc mutant, which was generated to illustrate how the internal sequential symmetry of the type-I Doc would allow for plasticity in cohesin binding (15). The -toxin Doc does not display this type of symmetry; thus we do not expect it, or the other C. perfringens Doc modules, to display a similar dual mode of X82 recognition. The structural similarity to the cellulolytic cohesin modules displayed by the C. perfringens X82 modules (18), in conjunction with their ability to interact with Doc modules with ultrahigh affinity, lends itself to their reclassification as cohesin modules. The predicted catalytic targets (eukaryotic glycans and/or glycosaminoglycans) of the X82- and Doc-containing C. perfringens glycoside hydrolases, which include the -toxin and NanJ sialidase, and their secretion to the extracellular milieu suggest that these enzymes are important components in the host­ pathogen interaction.

monosaccharide moieties that are densely packed within the extracellular matrix and on host cell surfaces, the expedient tissue destruction displayed by C. perfringens must require not only substantial production and secretion of these carbohydrateactive enzymes, but also their coordinated effort to degrade the complex carbohydrates. The extensive modularity of these enzymes beyond the catalytic domains and the reoccurring appearance of various protein modules suggest important functional roles. Because several of these large, multimodular enzymes contain additional uncharacterized modules, and because no binding partners for the putative CpGH31 Doc and cohesin modules have been identified, there exists the possibility of higher order enzyme complexes being formed. What our present findings clearly suggest is the formation of bimolecular glycoside hydrolase complexes, where these enzymes can act simultaneously and in concert, via the ultra-high-affinity X82 (cohesin)-Doc interaction, to impart their pathogenic effects. Such a synergistic action between glycoside hydrolases demands that these enzymes attack the same carbohydrate. Complexation facilitates the optimization of the enzymes such that they can attack a common complex carbohydrate and affords the opportunity of binding multiple substrates by incorporating multiple CBMs with varying specificities into a single complex, a scenario that could also enhance substrate binding through an avidity effect. Our biochemical structural characterization of C. perfringens X82-Doc interactions represents an example of noncellulosomal Doc-mediated enzyme complexes, and provides a rationale for the expeditious rate of tissue damage associated with C. perfringens infections.

Materials and Methods
Cloning. The cloning of the C-terminal FIVAR-Doc modular pair fragment from the -toxin and the X82 module of CpGH84C (CpGH84CX82) were performed as previously described (11, 22). FIVAR-Doc and CpGH84CX82 methionine mutant constructs were generated, in which Leu-1533 and Val-1535 of the former and Leu-784 and Leu-856 of the latter were each mutated to methionine residues for the generation of a seleno-L-methionine (SeMet)-containing complex. The methionine mutations were engineered by using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and a modified PCR protocol as previously reported (23). Subcloning of the FIVAR-Doc mutant construct made use of a single set of forward and reverse primers, whereas the generation of the CpGH84CX82 methionine-encoding mutant required a unique set of primers for each mutation (see Table S2). The respective methionine mutant-encoding plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue, isolated by using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen), and sequenced to assess mutagenesis. The gene fragment encoding NanJX82 was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of C. perfringens ATCC 13124 using a set of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (see Table S2). The amplified product was digested with NdeI and XhoI restriction endonucleases and ligated to NdeI and XhoI digested pET28a (Novagen). The resulting plasmid, encoding for NanJX82 fused to an N-terminal His6-tag via a thrombin protease cleavage site, was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for recombinant production.

CpGH95 (20) indicates that these modules target their respective catalytic domains to their eukaryotic carbohydrate targets, further supporting a role of these carbohydrate-active enzymes in the host­pathogen relationship. It therefore appears that this complex arsenal of C. perfringens glycoside hydrolases contributes to the bacterium's virulence through tissue/glycan destruction to promote spread, potentiating the activity of the major toxins and providing a source of nutrition for the bacterium. The generally accepted dogma associated to C. perfringens toxins and related glycoside hydrolases involves the secretion of soluble enzymes, which attach to the bacterial cell wall through a sortase-mediated process (21) or are free to diffuse and degrade host glycans as individual entities. Given that eukaryotic carbohydrates comprise a heterogeneous compilation of

Protein Production and Purification. Native FIVAR-Doc and CpGH84CX82 recombinant protein derivatives were expressed and purified as described previously (11, 22). Expression and purification of SeMet-labeled FIVAR-Doc and CpGH84CX82 was also performed in a manner similar to that previously described for the uniform 13C/15N-labeling of FIVAR-Doc and CpGH84CX82 (11, 22), with the exception that in the current study the expression plasmids encoding the FIVARDoc and CpGH84CX82 methionine mutants were transformed into the auxotrophic E. coli strain DL41(DE3) and the medium was supplemented with 50 mg SeMet rather than 1 g of 15N-NH4Cl and 2 g of 13C-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Recombinant expression, refolding, and purification of the SeMetFIVAR-Doc and SeMet-CpGH84CX82 mutant derivatives were performed as described for the native protein fragments. Formation of the FIVAR-Doc­CpGH84CX82 complex involved the combination of purified CpGH84CX82 and FIVAR-Doc at a molar ratio of 1.3:1 in 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5; 50 mM NaCl; and 5 mM CaCl2. The 1:1 FIVAR-Doc­CpGH84CX82 complex was purified from excess CpGH84CX82 by application on a Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 75 size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) equilibrated with 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5; 50 mM NaCl; and 5 mM CaCl2 and eluted in 2-ml fractions using the same buffer. Fractions containing the complex were identified by SDS/PAGE, pooled, and concentrated by using a Millipore Amicon 10-kDa centrifugal device to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml and stored at 4°C. Expression and purification of recombinant NanJX82 was performed similar to the method described previously for CpGH84CX82 (22). Purified NanJX82 was concentrated and buffer exchanged into 25 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5; 50 mM NaCl; and 5 mM CaCl2, using an Amicon stirred ultra-filtration unit (Amicon) with a 5-kDa

molecular weight cutoff membrane (MWCO; Filtron). Purity was assessed by SDS/PAGE, and the concentration determined by UV absorbance (280 nm) with a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 4,470 M 1/cm 1. ELISA Assays. The regions encoding the X82 modules from the genes Cpe1234 (NagJ), Cpe1364, Cpe0553 (NanJ), and Cpe0266 and the regions encoding the putative Doc modules from Cpe0191 ( -toxin), Cpe1266, Cpe1875, and Cpe1046 were amplified from the C. perfringens strain 13 genomic DNA with engineered XhoI and BamHI, and BamHI and KpnI restriction sites, respectively. The X82encoding fragments were cloned into a CBM3a-fusion construct, and the Docencoding fragments were cloned into a His-tagged heat stable xylanase (Xyn)fusion derivative as previously described (19). The resultant fusion proteins were recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified on amorphous cellulose (CBMcontaining protein derivatives) or by metal affinity chromatography (His-tagged protein derivatives), and the ELISA-based experiments were carried out similar to the method previously described (19), with incubation steps of 1 h at 37°C for each step. The ELISA plate was coated with 100 ng of CBM-X82 and assayed with 100 l of each of the Xyn-Doc derivatives (0 ­50 ng/ml). The final colorimetric assay was developed for 1 min. All assays were done in duplicate. Calorimetry. The FIVAR-Doc, CpGH84CX82, and NanJX82 protein samples for calorimetry, prepared in 25 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl2, were filtered and degassed at 21°C. The heat capacity measurements of 171 M CpGH84CX82, 198 M FIVARDoc, and 18.2 M FIVAR-Doc­CpGH84CX82 complex were performed from 20°C to 110°C with a scan rate of 45°C per hour by using a VP-DSC calorimeter

from MicroCal. The thermodynamic parameters of the single-unfolding transitions (Tm, Cp, and H) were calculated with Origin 5.0 software (MicroCal). The binding association constant (Ka) for the interaction was calculated as previously described (i.e., the melting temperature of the complex is higher than the melting temperatures of the individual components, taking into account the temperature shift of both transitions) (24). Titration of FIVAR-Doc (75­150 M) into CpGH84CX82 (10 M) or NanJX82 (5 M) was performed by using a VP-ITC titration calorimeter from Microcal. Twenty-five to 50 injections of 5­10 l were made, with 240 s of equilibration between injections. Titrations were done in triplicate at the following temperatures: 30°C, 35°C, and 37°C. The changes in enthalpy ( H) at these temperatures were determined manually from the total integrated heat generated in the experiment (corrected for heats of dilution), normalized to the amount of complex formed. Fitting a bimolecular binding model to the data gave H values that were in excellent agreement with the determined values (not shown). A change in heat capacity ( Cp) was determined to be 143.5 11.10 cal mol 1 K 1 as calculated from the temperature dependence of H. Using Cp and assuming its temperature independence, we extrapolated H to 88.9°C, the temperature at which the association constant was determined. Using the Cp, H (at 88.9°C), and Ka (at 88.9°C) as references, we determined the association constant at 37°C with the integrated form of the van't Hoff equation (25). Crystallization. Using the vapor diffusion hanging drop method at 21°C, we obtained crystals of the native FIVAR-Doc­CpGH84CX82 complex at 25 mg/ml in 20% (wt/vol) PEG 2000; 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5; and 0.2 M ammonium sulfate. Crystals of the SeMet-containing complex were obtained at 25 mg/ml in 19% (wt/vol) PEG 1500 and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5). NanJX82 was treated overnight at room temperature with thrombin and separated from the cleaved hexa-histidine tag by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S200 column (GE Biosciences). Pure fractions were concentrated in a 10-ml stirred ultra-filtration Amicon device using a 5-kDa MWCO membrane to 15 mg/ml for crystallization. Crystals of native NanJX82 were obtained in 20% (wt/vol) PEG 4000; 0.2 M ammonium acetate; and 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6 by using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18°C. Data Collection and Refinement. Data for the native (wild-type, unlabeled) and SeMet-containing (mutant) FIVAR-Doc­CpGH84CX82 complex crystals were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). The crystals were flash-cooled in a cryostream of N2 gas at 100 K by using well solutions supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) glycerol (native) and 20% (vol/vol) PEG 400 (SeMet) as cryoprotectant. Processing of the FIVAR-Doc­CpGH84CX82 diffrac-

tion data was performed with HKL2000 (26). Diffraction data for the selenium substituted FIVAR-Doc­CpGH84CX82 mutant were collected on beamline X6A at a wavelength optimized for f at the selenium edge. This structure was solved by SAD using SOLVE (27) to determine selenium substructure (five atoms were found in the asymmetric unit) and RESOLVE (27) for density modification and initial structure tracing. This initial model was used as input into ARP/wARP (28) with the native FIVAR-Doc­CpGH84CX82 diffraction data collected on beamline X8C. ARP/wARP was able to build a virtually complete model that was completed by manual building. Diffraction data for native NanJX82 were collected on a home source Rigaku R-AXIS 4 area detector coupled to a MM-002 x-ray generator with Osmic ``blue'' optics and an Oxford Cryostream 700. These crystals were flash-cooled in the cryo-stream at 113 K after protection with 20% (vol/vol) ethylene glycol. The NanJX82 diffraction data were processed with Crystal Clear/d*TREK (29). This structure was solved by molecular replacement by using the CpGH84CX82 coordinates as a search model and MOLREP (30) to find the single molecule in the asymmetric unit. After minor truncation and manual correction of the initial model, ARP/wARP was able to build a virtually complete model that required minimal alteration. All computing was done with CCP4 (31) unless otherwise stated. Manual graphical model building was performed with COOT (32), and refinements were done with REFMAC (33). Water molecules were added to all models by using the REFMAC implementation of ARP/wARP and were inspected visually before deposition. In all data sets, 5% of the observations were flagged as ``free'' (34) and used to monitor refinement procedures. The structure comprises residues 774 ­ 906 of CpGH84C, residues 1498 ­1628 of the -toxin, 315 water molecules, two Ca2 ions, and a chloride ion. All final model statistics are given in Table S3. All structural representations were generated in PyMOL (35). ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
