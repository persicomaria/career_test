Summary YopH is a protein tyrosine phosphatase and an essential virulence determinant of the pathogenic bacterium Yersinia. Yersinia delivers YopH into infected host cells using a type III secretion mechanism. YopH dephosphorylates several focal adhesion proteins including p130Cas in human epithelial cells, resulting in disruption of focal adhesions and cell detachment from the extracellular matrix. How the C-terminal protein tyrosine phosphatase domain of YopH targets specific substrates such as p130Cas in the complex milieu of the host cell has not been fully elucidated. An N-terminal non-catalytic domain of YopH binds p130Cas in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner and functions as a novel substrate-targeting site. The structure of the YopH protein tyrosine phosphatase domain bound to a model phosphopeptide substrate was solved and the resulting structure revealed a second substrate-targeting site (`site 2') within the catalytic domain. Site 2 binds to p130Cas in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner, and co-operates with the N-terminal domain (`site 1') to promote efficient recognition of p130Cas by YopH in epithelial cells. The identification of two substrate-targeting sites in YopH that co-operate to promote epithelial cell detachment and bacterial virulence reinforces the importance of protein­protein interactions for determining protein

tyrosine phosphatase specificity in vivo, and highlights the sophisticated nature of microbial pathogenicity factors. Introduction Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica are Gram-negative bacterial pathogens of humans and a variety of animal species. Y. pestis is the agent of plague (Perry and Fetherston, 1997). Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica cause enteritis and mesenteric lymphadenitis (Carniel et al., 2002). The human-pathogenic Yersinia species share a number of common virulence factors (Revell and Miller, 2001; Carniel, 2002). One such virulence determinant is a type III secretion system (TTSS) encoded on a 70 kb plasmid (Cornelis, 2002; Ramamurthi and Schneewind, 2002). The Yersinia TTSS is homologous to TTSSs found in a variety of other bacterial pathogens (Hueck, 1998). The Yersinia TTSS exports a set of proteins (Yops and LcrV) upon contact with host cells (Cornelis, 2002; Ramamurthi and Schneewind, 2002). These proteins are released into extracellular milieu, inserted into the host cell membrane or delivered into the cytoplasm of the host cell (Cornelis, 2002; Ramamurthi and Schneewind, 2002). The Yops and LcrV act in concert to thwart innate cellular immune responses to Yersinia (Cornelis, 2002; Ramamurthi and Schneewind, 2002). YopH is a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that is delivered into the cytoplasm of host cells infected by Yersinia (Guan and Dixon, 1990; Bliska et al., 1991). YopH has been shown to uncouple multiple signal transduction pathways in host cells (Fällman et al., 1997; Bliska, 2000). In human epithelial cells YopH dephosphorylates several focal adhesion proteins, including p130Cas (Cas) (Black and Bliska, 1997; Persson et al., 1997). Dephosphorylation of Cas and other focal adhesion proteins by YopH results in cellular retraction from the extracellular matrix and inhibition of integrin-mediated bacterial invasion (Black and Bliska, 1997; Persson et al., 1997). The 468-amino-acid YopH protein is composed of two modular domains linked by a proline-rich sequence. The PTP domain is comprised of residues ª163­468 (Zhang et al., 1992). The three-dimensional structure of the PTP

Mechanism of substrate targeting by Yersinia YopH 1347 domain has been determined (Stuckey et al., 1994). Residues 403­410 form a phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) within the active site. Substitution of the essential catalytic Cys residue at position 403 to Ser results in a catalytically inactive enzyme that retains the ability to bind substrates at the active site (substrate trapping) (Guan and Dixon, 1990; Bliska et al., 1991; Montagna et al., 2001). Substitution of the essential catalytic Arg residue at position 409 with Ala ablates substrate binding and catalysis by YopH (Guan and Dixon, 1990; Zhang et al., 1994a; Montagna et al., 2001). Residues 1­129 of YopH comprise an Nterminal domain, which contains signals required for TTSS-mediated delivery of YopH into host cells (Cornelis, 2002). The N-terminal region also binds to tyrosinephosphorylated proteins and functions within the host cell as a substrate-targeting domain (Black et al., 1998; Deleuil et al., 2003). Several residues within the Nterminal domain that are required for substrate targeting (e.g. Val31) were identified using a genetic approach (Montagna et al., 2001). Three-dimensional structures have been determined for the N-terminal domain using X-ray crystallography (Smith et al., 2001) or NMR (Khandelwal et al., 2002). The fold of the N-terminal domain is unlike that of SH2 or PTB domains. This region of YopH appears to represent a novel type of phosphotyrosine-binding domain (Smith et al., 2001). Previous studies revealed that YopH binds to the prototypical substrate Cas in vivo via either the N-terminal domain (hereafter referred to as `site 1') or the active site (hereafter referred to as `A site') containing the substratetrapping C403S mutation (Black et al., 1998; Montagna et al., 2001). However, inactivation of substrate-binding activity in site 1 using the V31G mutation and in the A site using the R409A mutation did not eliminate interaction with Cas (Montagna et al., 2001) (see Fig. 3), suggesting that another substrate binding site may be present in YopH. This possibility was investigated. Results Persson et al. (1999) have implicated an exposed loop in the catalytic domain of YopH (residues 223­226) as being important for efficient focal contact targeting. To determine whether residues 223­226 of YopH could be important for interaction with Cas, these residues were deleted (`D' mutation) in the context of the A site mutant protein (YopHR409A). HeLa cells were infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis strains producing YopHR409A or the double mutant YopHDRA, and immunofluorescence microscopy was used to detect localization of YopH to focal adhesions. As shown in Fig. 1, YopHR409A and YopHDRA showed equivalent focal adhesion localization activity (compare Fig. 1B and D). To confirm these results, the infected cells were lysed and an interaction of Cas with YopH was assayed by

immunoprecipitation and anti-pTyr immunoblotting. A similar amount of pTyr-containing protein p130 (corresponding to Cas) was co-precipitated with YopHR409A and YopHDRA (Fig. 1E and F, lanes 3 and 5), indicating that residues 223­226 of YopH are dispensable for interaction with Cas. We have determined the crystal structure, refined to 3.0 Å resolution, of an inactive YopH catalytic domain (residues 163­468) with Ser substituted for the active site Cys403 (YopHC403S) bound to the phosphopeptide substrate DADEpYL, which is based on an autophosphorylation site of the EGFR (Zhang et al., 1994b). We have also determined the 2.5 Å resolution structure of the wild-type YopH complexed with the same peptide but containing difluorophosphonomethyl-phenylalanine, a non-hydrolysable analogue of phosphotyrosine (DADEdfpYL). The two crystals are isomorphous and each contains two enzyme complexes in a P1 unit cell. Details of the crystals and structure solution are shown in Table 1. While this manuscript was in preparation, Phan et al. (2003) reported the structure of the catalytic domain of YopH in complex with a non-hydrolysable hexapeptide substrate. Both crystal structures reported here show well-ordered electron density consistent with a bound peptide at a second substrate binding site (hereafter referred to as `site 2'), approximately 38 Å from the active site P-loop and about 35 Å from the putative focal complex targeting loop comprised of residues 223­226 (Fig. 2A). The structure reported by Phan et al. (2003) also contains a peptide bound to site 2. These authors suggested that site 2 could be involved in substrate recognition in vivo, although no functional data in support of this idea were obtained (Phan et al., 2003). The electron density at site 2 clearly defines at least five of the six peptide side-chain positions (Fig. 2B). In contrast, peptide electron density at the active site of the difluorophosphonate structure clearly shows only three to four of the side-chains, and only the phosphotyrosine is resolved at the active site in the YopHC403S structure (data not shown). The better density at site 2 may be indicative of a tighter affinity than the active site or it may result from an arginine from another molecule in the unit cell (data not shown) that makes hydrogen bonds to the phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 2A, the DADEdfpYL phosphopeptide at site 2 binds in a groove formed by residues at the end of helix a4, the beginning of b-strand b6 and the loop between a2 and b3 (secondary structure designations are from Stuckey et al., 1994). The conformation of the peptide main-chain is similar to two consecutive b-turns. Most of the specific interactions are to the phosphotyrosine residue, which lies parallel to the protein surface, rather than buried in a deep pocket as it is in the active site. Two charged residues ligate the phosphonate (Fig. 2C): Arg278, from the a2­b3 loop, forms a bidentate salt-

Fig. 1. Site 2 in YopH is important for substrate binding in host cells. HeLa cells were infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis for 2 h. The strains used carried an empty vector (vector), and therefore expressed no YopH, or carried vectors expressing YopHK342AM45 (K342A), YopHR409AM45 (R409A), YopHK342AR409AM45 (KARA) or YopHDR409AM45 (DRA).

Binding of Cas (p130) to mutant YopH proteins was examined by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting.

bridge with the phosphate similar to what is observed with the catalytic Arg in the active site. Lys342 forms a saltbridge to the phosphonate oxygens as well as one fluorine atom and Glu4 (P-1 position) of the peptide. Two Ser residues also make hydrogen bonds to the phosphonate oxygens. Lys386 forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu4 carbonyl and non-polar contacts with the phosphonate ring. Other peptide main-chain atoms also make hydrogen bonds with the protein (Fig. 2C). The specific interactions with the phosphonate suggest that pTyr is probably the primary determinant of specificity for peptides binding to

this site. As there are few other specific interactions with the other side-chains (except for Glu4), this binding site may accommodate a variety of pTyr-containing sequences such as those observed in the multiple phosphorylation motifs present in the Cas natural substrate. To determine whether site 2 is important for interaction of YopH with Cas in vivo, we introduced a Lys342 to Ala (K342A) mutation into the YopHR409A protein to inactivate site 2. The resulting YopH protein mutated in site 2 and the P-loop (YopHKARA) showed reduced localization to focal adhesions, and increased protein localization to the

cytosol of the infected cells (compare Fig. 1B and C). In addition, co-precipitation of Cas with YopHKARA in infected cells was reduced as compared with the controls (Fig. 1E and F, lane 4). These results suggest that site 2 is involved in targeting YopH to Cas in vivo. The K342A mutation is not expected to diminish the intrinsic catalytic activity of YopH, as it is distant from the A site. To confirm that the K342A mutation does not inhibit intrinsic catalytic activity, HeLa cells were infected with a Y. pseudotuberculosis strain producing YopHK342A, which is only mutated in site 2. Dephosphorylation of total cellular proteins after a 2 h infection was examined by anti-pTyr immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1G, bands of 130 kDa (p130) and 68 kDa (p68) were dephosphorylated in the presence of YopHK342A. These bands have previously been shown to correspond to Cas and paxillin respectively (Black and Bliska, 1997; Black et al., 1998). Further evidence that YopHK342A did not have diminished catalytic activity was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation. YopHK342A did not localize to focal adhesions (Fig. 1A), and did not co-precipitate with Cas (Fig. 1E and F, lane 2). To determine whether sites 1 and 2 can function independently to bind substrate, mutations designed to inactivate site 1, or site 1 and site 2, were introduced into the A site mutant YopHR409A. After HeLa cells were infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis strains producing these proteins, substrate-binding activity was measured using immunofluorecence microscopy and immunoprecipitation.

As shown above, inactivation of site 2 and the A site (YopHKARA) reduced, but did not eliminate, focal adhesion localization (Fig. 3B) or Cas binding (Fig. 3D­F, lane 5). Inactivation of site 1 and the A site (YopHVGRA) eliminated focal adhesion localization activity (Fig. 3A) and diminished, but did not eliminate, interaction of YopH with Cas (Fig. 3D­F, lane 3). Inactivation of site 1, site 2 and the A site (YopHVGKARA) further reduced the ability of YopH to bind Cas (Fig. 3D­F, lane 4). Densitometry was used to measure the signal intensities of the Cas bands detected in Fig. 3E, and these signals were normalized to the amounts of Cas present in lysates before immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3G). The calculations show that inactivation of site 2 decreased Cas binding by approximately twofold in the context of an intact site 1 (YopHRA versus YopHKARA) and by ª24-fold in the context of a mutated site 1 (YopHVGRA versus YopHVGKARA). These results show that sites 1 and 2 can function independently to bind Cas in host cells (Fig. 3H). Of the two, site 1 appears to bind more avidly to Cas, which may explain why site 1 is sufficient for focal adhesion localization. To confirm that site 2 binds Cas directly, we carried out an in vitro binding reaction with purified proteins. Purified Cas protein was phosphorylated using the Src kinase. As shown in Fig. 4A, phosphorylation of Cas (p-Cas) was evident by a decreased mobility during SDS-PAGE, and increased reactivity with anti-pTyr antibody. The catalytic domains (CDs; residues 172­468) of YopH proteins with mutations in A site or site 2, or both, were purified as GST

fusion constructs (GST­YopHCD). GST fusion proteins were bound to beads, incubated with p-Cas, and after washing, the amount of p-Cas bound to the GST fusion proteins was measured by anti-Cas immunoblotting. The highest level of binding to full-length Cas and several Cas truncation products was observed with the positive control YopHCDC403S construct (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Mutation of the catalytic Cys residue at position 403 to Ser results in trapping of substrates at the active site (Guan and Dixon, 1990; Bliska et al., 1991; Montagna et al., 2001). Reduced Cas-binding activity was observed when 10-fold less YopHCDC403S was bound to the beads (lane 1). In addition, when YopHCDR409A and YopHCDKARA were used in binding reactions, less Cas bound to the latter construct, indicating that site 2 binds directly to tyrosinephosphorylated Cas (compare lanes 3 and 4). To evaluate the importance of sites 1 and 2 for the biological activity of YopH, HeLa cells were infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis strains producing catalytically active YopH proteins with mutations in site 1, site 2 or both. Rounding and detachment of the HeLa cells in response to disruption of focal adhesions by YopH activity was measured by phase contrast microscopy, and by a quantitative viable cell assay (MTT assay). As shown in Fig. 5, wildtype YopH caused ª80% of the HeLa cells to detach (Fig. 5B and G), while the catalytically inactive YopHR409A protein did not cause any detachment (Fig. 5C and G). Approximately 60% of the cells detached when site 1 (YopHV31G) or site 2 (YopHK342A) were inactivated, while fewer cells detached (ª40%) when both sites were inactivated (YopHVGKA) (Fig. 5D­G). Therefore, sites 1 and 2 cooperate to promote cell detachment by YopH in an in vitro infection assay. A mouse infection assay (Bliska et al., 1991) was used to evaluate the importance of site 1 and site 2 for the virulence function of YopH. Y. pseudotuberculosis is highly lethal for mice via the intravenous route of infection; this infection model approximates the systemic phase of plague (Une and Brubaker, 1984). Mice were infected with an equal mixture of a test strain and a chloramphenicolresistant yopH::cam null mutant as a reference strain. The ability of mutant test strains to out-compete the reference strain for colonization of the spleen was determined by a competitive index (CI) assay. Test strains contained mutant yopH alleles introduced into the native location on the virulence plasmid. A test strain used as a wild-type control was constructed by introducing a silent mutation resulting in an Nde restriction site at the yopH initiation codon (yopHNde). As shown in Fig. 6, the wild-type test strain (yopHNde) out-competed the reference strain by a factor of ª100 (geometric mean of control CI = 0.015). In contrast, the test strain expressing catalytically inactive YopH (yopHR409A) did not out-compete the reference strain (geometric mean CI = 2.54). Test strains mutated in the

focal contact targeting loop (yopHD223-226), in site 2 (yopHK342A) or in site 1 (yopHV31G), had geometric mean CI values of 0.011, 0.014 and 0.023, respectively, and the CI data for these competitions were not significantly different (unpaired Student's t-test) from the control competition. The competition data for the test strain mutated in sites 1 and 2 (yopHVGKA) (geometric mean CI = 0.033) was significantly different (P = 0.044) from the control competition (Fig. 6). Therefore, sites 1 and site 2 in YopH co-operate to promote substrate targeting in vivo, and this activity is important for Yersinia virulence. Discussion It is well established that targeting domains play a key role in substrate recognition by PTPs (Mauro and Dixon, 1994; Tonks and Neel, 2001). As shown here, substrate recog© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 55, 1346­1356

nition by YopH involves two substrate-targeting sites that function in a cooperative manner. Other PTPs, such as SHP-2, contain duplicate substrate-targeting domains in the form of tandem SH2 domains (Tonks and Neel, 2001). In the case of SHP-2, the phosphotyrosine residues recognized by the SH2 domains serve as docking sites for the enzyme, but are not dephosphorylated by the catalytic domain. In contrast, the phosphotyrosine residues that are recognized by sites 1 and 2 in YopH may serve as docking sites initially, but are ultimately dephosphorylated by the catalytic domain. The substrate region of Cas contains multiple phosphorylation sites that are on average 21 residues apart (Bouton et al., 2001). It is likely that sites 1 and 2 allow YopH to act in a highly processive manner to dephosphorylate the substrate region of Cas. However, the finding that site 2 is on the opposite side of the catalytic domain from the A site makes it unlikely that

Cas contains 15 phosphorylation sites with a consensus motif (D/E)(V/I)pY(D/Q)VPP, which contains the preferred consensus motif (pY)XXP for the SH2 domain of the Crk protein (Bouton et al., 2001). In this light, it is interesting to compare the mode of phosphopeptide binding to site 2 with phosphopeptide binding to Crk SH2 domain (PDB id 1JUF). In both structures, the phosphotyrosine moiety binds with its ring approximately parallel to the protein surface, located on loops between b-strands and near the N-terminus of an a-helix. In both cases an Arg and one or more serines are involved in ligating the phosphate moiety. The EGFR-derived peptide used in this study does not contain the residues following the phosphotyrosine residues that are present in the p130Cas phosphorylation sites. Nevertheless, we speculate that a Cas-derived peptide would bind similarly. As the P+1 (Leu) side-chain in the present structure points towards Arg337, we propose that the Cas P+1 Asp would form an ionic interaction with that residue. The subsequent three hydrophobic residues V­P­P might bind in a relatively hydrophobic cleft between the a4-helix and three b-strands of the nearby bsheet. Additional YopH­phosphopeptide complex structures will need to be solved to confirm this hypothesis. Experimental procedures Protein crystallography
The catalytic domain of YopH and YopHC403S (residues 163­ 468) from Y. enterocolitica were purified as described (Zhang et al., 1992). Both of these constructs contain the C235R mutation shown not to affect catalytic activity. The phosphotyrosine peptide acetyl-DADE(pY)L-NH2 was synthesized at the University of Michigan Protein Core facility and the difluorophosphonomethyl-phenylalanine-containing peptide of the same sequence was kindly provided by Dr Robert Zamboni and Dr Michael Gresser, Merck Frosst, Montreal. YopHC403S (163­468) at a concentration of 10­12 mg ml-1 was pre-incubated with 1 mM of the pY-containing peptide and then mixed with an equal volume of precipitant containing 18­24% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 50­100 mM NaCl, 0.1% b-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM TrisCl, pH 8.5. Seeding of the rod-shaped crystals gave crystals as large as 0.8 ¥ 0.4 ¥ 0.4 mm3. Diffraction intensities were measured on an SDMS multiwire detector at room temperature and processed with MADNES (Messerschmidt and Pflugrath, 1987). Molecular replacement with the 1YTS structure was performed in X-PLOR, and the two protein complexes in the unit cell were refined with data to 3.0 Å resolution with crystallography and NMR system (CNS) (Brunger et al., 1998) with non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. To crystallize the complex with the difluorophosphonomethyl-phenylalaninecontaining peptide, YopH (163­468) at 10 mg ml-1 in 1 mM imidazole, pH 7.5 was incubated with 0.5 mM peptide (final concentration) for 1 h at room temperature.

The GST fusion proteins contained the catalytic domains of YopHC403SM45 (CS), YopHR409AM45 (RA) or YopHK342AR409AM45 (KARA). C. Recovery of GST fusion proteins on the beads was measured by anti-YopH immunoblotting. The positions of bands corresponding to the GST­YopH catalytic domain (CD) proteins are indicated.

The model shown at the top of Fig. 3H illustrates a conformation in which sites 1 and 2 are engaged on a single Cas molecule, leaving the A site exposed to dephosphorylate an adjacent Cas molecule. It will be necessary to determine the structure of full-length YopH in complex with a

Fig. 5. Sites 1 and 2 co-operate to promote YopH cell detachment activity. HeLa cells were infected with yopH mutant Y. pseudotuberculosis strains for 1 h, bacteria were then killed by addition of gentamicin, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 18 h. Unbound cells were removed by washing. A­F. Representative phase contrast images were captured by digital photomicroscopy. G. Viable cells were quantified using an MTT assay. Results were normalized to uninfected cells. Results shown are the means and standard deviations of values obtained from three different wells for each condition performed in a single experiment and are representative of three independent experiments. The yopHVGKA mutant promoted significantly less cell detachment than either the yopHVG or the yopHKA mutant (P < 0.001).

mixed with precipitant containing 22% PEG 4000, 8 mM MnCl2, 0.1% b-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and equilibrated by microvapour diffusion against the same precipitant. See Table 1 for data and refinement statistics. Co-ordinates are available from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) as 1XXP and 1XXV.

Bacterial strains
The Y. pseudotuberculosis strains used for HeLa cell infection assays were derived from YP17 (yopH::cam yopE::kan) (Montagna et al., 2001). Plasmids derived from pMMB76HE which encode wild-type or mutant forms of YopH with appended M45 epitope tags (pPYopHM45, pPYopHR409AM45, pPYopHV31GM45 and pPYopHV31GR409AM45) have been previously described (Montagna et al., 2001). Plasmids encoding additional mutant forms of YopHM45 (pPYopHK342AM45,

pPYopHV31GK342AR409AM45 and pPYopHK342AR409AM45, DR409A M45) were constructed in the same vector using pPYopH appropriate oligonucleotides and polymerase chain reactions. Plasmids were introduced into YP17 by conjugation (Montagna et al., 2001). Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains used in mouse infection studies were IP9 (yopH::cam), and additional yopH mutants derived from IP9 (Bliska et al., 1991). Mutant yopH alleles (yopHNde, yopHV31G, yopHD223-226, yopHK342A, yopHR409A and yopHVGKA) were introduced onto the virulence plasmid carried by IP9 using the plasmid pSB890 and a standard allelic recombination strategy (Palmer et al., 1998). Following allelic recombination isolated colonies of Y. pseudotuberculosis were tested for loss of tetracycline resistance (to confirm excision of pSB890) and loss of chloramphenicol resistance (to confirm replacement of the yopH::cam allele). The presence of the virulence plasmid was verified by patching colonies on Congo red-magnesium oxalate agar plates (Riley and

washed three times with binding buffer. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas (2.5 ng per reaction) was diluted into 500 ml of binding buffer containing 1 mM NaVO4 and 10 mM NaF, and incubated with the beads pre-loaded with GST fusion protein. After incubation for 60 min at room temperature, the beads were washed twice with binding buffer containing 1 mM NaVO4 and 10 mM NaF and twice with PBS containing 1 mM NaVO4 and 10 mM NaF. The amount of Cas and GST fusion protein bound to the beads was measured by immunoblotting as described (Montagna et al., 2001).

Competitive Index

HeLa cell infection
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cultures were grow in LB containing 2.5 mM CaCl2 and used to infect HeLa cells for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting or immunofluorescence microscopy assays as described (Montagna et al., 2001). Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting or immunofluorescence microscopy assays were performed as described (Montagna et al., 2001). Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cultures used for MTT assays were grown in LB containing 20 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM sodium oxalate for 1 h at 26C and 2 h at 37C. The cultures were washed with PBS and used to infect HeLa cells (1 ¥ 105 per well in a 24-well tissue culture plate) at multiplicity of infection of 100. After 1 h of infection, the HeLa cells were washed once with PBS, and incubated in fresh medium containing 100 mg ml-1 gentamicin. At 19 h post infection detached cells were removed by washing with PBS and fresh media containing 500 mg ml-1 MTT (Sigma M-5655) was added to each well. After 4 h of incubation at 37C/5% CO2 the media was removed by aspiration and 100 ml of DMSO was added to each well. After 3 min incubation at room temperature, 900 ml of 0.04 N HCl-acidified isopropanol was added to each well and the plate was shaken thoroughly for 5 min. The absorbance of each sample at 570 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer (model ELx800, BIO-TEK Instruments). Values obtained from three different wells for each condition were averaged. Statistical significance was evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test (Instat Version 2.01). A P-value of <0.05 was considered significant in individual comparisons.

Fig. 6. Sites 1 and 2 co-operate to promote the virulence function of YopH in mice. Mice were infected intravenously with ª500 cfu of a Y. pseudotuberculosis test strain (yopHNde, yopHD223-226, yopHK342A, yopHV31G, yopHVGKA or yopHR409A) mixed with ª500 cfu of the reference yopH::cam mutant. Four days post infection the mice were euthanized, the spleens were removed and homogenized, and dilutions of the homogenates were plated to enumerate output cfu of the reference strain (camR) and the test strain (camS). Competitive index (CI) values (filled circles) were transformed logarithmically to determine geometric means (horizontal bars) and P-values. The difference between the CI data for the yopHVGKA competition and the yopHNde competition was statistically significant (P = 0.044).

Toma, 1989). Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the yopH sequences from prospective recombinants and the presence of the appropriate mutation was confirmed by sequencing. For infection assays, bacterial cultures were grown overnight at 28C with shaking in Luria broth (LB), diluted in fresh media to an OD600 of 0.1 and grown with shaking at 37C as described below.

In vitro binding reaction
Cas and v-Src were tagged at the N-terminus with polyhistidine and purified as described previously (Goldberg et al., 2003). In vitro kinase reactions with Cas and v-Src were performed as described previously (Goldberg et al., 2003). Plasmids that encode mutant forms of YopH catalytic domains fused to GST were constructed using pGEX-KG as described (Black et al., 2000). DNA fragments encoding residues 172­468 of the different mutant yopH alleles (yopHC403S, yopHR409A and yopHKARA) with appended M45 tags were inserted between the SmaI and EcoRI sites of pGEXKG. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli TUNER cells (Novagen) and purified on GSTrap FF columns (Amersham Biosciences) using conditions suggested by the manufacturer. To start the binding reactions, 0.1 or 1 mg of purified GST fusion protein were diluted into 500 ml of binding buffer [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/1% BSA] and mixed with 20 ml of glutathione sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). After 60 min incubation at room temperature, the beads were

Mouse infection
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cultures for mouse infections were grown in LB for 3 h at 37C. The cultures were washed in PBS and diluted to 104 colony-forming units (cfu) per millilitre. Each of the test strains was mixed with an equal volume of the reference strain (IP9, yopH::cam) and 100 ml of the mixture was injected into the tail vein of a 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mouse (Taconic). Input cfu (ª500 cfu of each strain, total of ª1000 cfu) in each mixture was determined by plating on LB agar or LB agar containing chloramphenicol (30 mg ml-1). Mice were euthanized 4 days post infection. Spleens were removed and homogenized in 4.5 ml of PBS. The total number of output cfu per spleen was determined by plating serial dilutions of the homogenates on LB agar. The number of output cfu corresponding to IP9 per spleen was determined by replica plating onto LB agar containing

chloramphenicol (30 mg ml-1). CI values were calculated using the following formula: (IP9 output cfu/test strain output cfu)/(IP9 input cfu/test strain input cfu) Competitive index values were transformed logarithmically, and a two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test (InStat, version 2.01) was used to determine P-values, comparing the CI values from the IP9/yopHNde competition with CI values from other competitions.
