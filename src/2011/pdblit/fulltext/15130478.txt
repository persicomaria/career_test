Abstract A soluble N-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli adenylyl transferase (ATase) is responsible for deadenylylation activity of the intact enzyme. Previous studies of the deadenylylation activity have involved a fragment, AT-N423 (residues 1 to 423), which was extended by 17 amino acids to give AT-N440. This new domain is truncated at the end of a predicted helix and prior to a Qlinker. The domain was found to be very soluble and stable so that it could be purified to homogeneity and crystallized. This construct has deadenylylation activity that is independent of the low nitrogen status indicator PII-UMP. The crystals belong to   space group P31 21 or its enantiomorph P32 21 with a ¼ b ¼ 116:6 A and c ¼ 67:6 A. Ó 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase (ATase, EC 2.7.7.42) catalyses the adenylylation and deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase (GS). The two activities of ATase are functionally the reverse of one another and must be carefully controlled by the organism to prevent futile cycling [1,2]. Growth will occur in a low ammonia environment if GS is active, with the deadenylylation activity of ATase switched on and the adenylylation activity switched off. Conversely, in a high ammonia environment, the adenylylation activity of ATase is switched on and deadenylylation activity must be switched off. The two antagonistic activities of ATase are influenced by the signal transduction protein PII, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), and glutamine. PII is the nitrogen status indicator of the cell:

PII-UMP implies low nitrogen while unmodified PII implies nitrogen excess. The modification of PII is carried out by uridylyl transferase (UTase) [3,4]. In a low nitrogen environment, the uridylylation activity of UTase is stimulated and PII is converted to PII-UMP. PII-UMP binds to ATase as a complex with ATP and 2OG and inhibits the adenylylation activity, at the same time stimulating the deadenylylation activity of ATase [5­7]. In a high nitrogen environment, the supply of 2OG is depleted and glutamine concentration increases. In this case, the uridylyl removing activity of UTase causes PII-UMP to be converted to PII. The unmodified PII and glutamine bind to ATase with a consequent reduction in deadenylylation activity and an activation of the adenylylation activity. It has been shown that the two activities of ATase reside on separate domains [8]. To date, studies of the N-terminal domain of ATase have utilized a fragment that consists of residues 1­423, AT-N423 [8]. Although active, this fragment has very poor solubility properties that make purification and physical characterization extremely difficult. We set out to identify other

sampled (10 ll) whole cell (wc) extracts. The sampled supernatant (sn; 10 ll for each construct) was obtained after centrifugation of the remaining cell extract at 100,000g for 20 min. Equal volume (10 ll) of cell free extract and supernatant for each construct was separated by SDS­PAGE (10% w/v), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with mouse polyclonal antibodies raised against ATase.

Expression and purification The plasmid pDW1 was used for high level, heat inducible expression of AT-N440 in E. coli strain JM109 in Luria­Bertani broth (LB) containing ampicillin 100 lg/ml at 30 °C with shaking until OD595 reached $0.5. Cultures were induced by raising the temperature quickly to 42 °C. Growth was continued for a further 3 h. The resulting cells were pelleted by centrifugation in an Avanti centrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 8000g for 10 min. These pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer (20 mM phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol) and lysed with a French pressure cell (Aminco). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 40,000g for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate precipitation of proteins in the supernatant was performed on ice using ground ultrapure ammonium sulfate (ICN, USA). (NH4 )2 SO4 was added to the supernatant to 25% (w/v) saturation. The protein solution was centrifuged at 40,000g for 20 min to remove precipitated material. Following centrifugation, (NH4 )2 SO4 was added to 40% (w/v) saturation. The precipitated protein was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 M MgCl2 , and 1 mM bmercaptoethanol) containing 20% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The protein solution was then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham) column (2.6 Â 30 cm, 50 ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A containing 20% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 200 ml buffer A containing 20% ammonium sulfate followed by a 500 ml reverse liner gradient (from 20 to 0%) of ammonium sulfate in buffer A. AT-N440 was eluted at 0% ammonium sulfate. The peak fractions from the hydrophobic interaction chromatography step were pooled and directly loaded onto a SOURCE 15Q anion exchange column (Amersham), which had been previously equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was eluted from the SOURCE 15Q column at 350­450 mM NaCl with a 0­1 M NaCl gradient in buffer A. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1.5 ml. The concentrated AT-N440 sample was loaded onto a 124 ml Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham) preequilibrated with buffer B (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 , and 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol). Fractions containing AT-N440 were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml for crystallization trials.

N-terminal fragments that had properties more amenable to physical studies. We speculated that the poor properties of AT-N423 were due to the fact that it did not form the entire deadenylylation domain. This speculation was supported by the observation that the Cterminus of AT-N423 lay in the middle of a predicted helix (Fig. 1). Here, we report the purification, enzymatic characterization, and crystallization of AT-N440.

Materials and methods Construction of AT-N440 The minigene encoding AT-N440 was amplified by PCR using pRJ009 plasmid [8] as the template. The PCR forward primer 50 -AATCGCATATGAAGCCGCTC-30 which introduced an NdeI restriction site (underlined), and the reverse primer 50 -TATATTGGTACCTTATTC ATCGTCGCCAATCAA-30 which introduced a flanking KpnI site (underlined), were used to PCR amplify the AT-N440 minigene. The PCR amplified minigene was purified and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into pND707 [9] to construct pDW1 bearing AT-N440. The correctness of the clone was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Protein solubility analysis The solubility of proteins was analysed essentially as described by Grisshammer and Nagai [10]. Briefly, cells from a 50 ml culture were harvested by centrifugation (8000g) and the resulting pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl, and 1 ml of buffer per 1 g of wet cells). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ ml and after incubating the solution on ice for 10 min, the cells were lysed by 3 freeze­thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and water at 37 °C, respectively, to provide the

GS-AMP deadenylylation assay To assess the enzymatic activity of AT-N440, the deadenylylation of GS-AMP was monitored as the rate of formation of c-glutamylhydroxamate (c-GH) utilizing the c-glutamyl transferase activity of GS as described by Stadtman et al. [11]. The c-glutamyl transferase activity was measured in microtitre plates at 30 °C as described previously [8,12]. The assay was started by adding solutions of 100 ll AT-N440 diluted in BSA (1 mg/ml) containing PEG 6000 (10%) to 100 ll of AT-N440 reaction mixture (2Â) containing: Hepes­HCl (100 mM, pH 7.6), BSA (2 mg/ ml), potassium phosphate (50 mM), MgCl2 (10 mM), ATP (2 mM, pH 7.6), as well as 2OG (40 mM) and GS-AMP (100 nM; n ¼ 11). PII-UMP (0.05 lM) was added to the reaction mixture as indicated. At indicated time intervals, an aliquot of 10 ll was withdrawn from the AT-N440 reaction mixture and added to 100 ll of the c-glutamyl transferase assay mixture (GSB, pH 7.2) containing: imidazole­HCl (0.16 M), glutamine (0.16 M), NH2 OH (42 mM), ADP (0.42 mM), Na2 HAsO4 (21 mM), MgCl2 (62.5 mM), and MnCl2 (0.42 mM). The c-glutamyl transferase assay was terminated after 30 min by adding 200 ll of the stop mixture containing: FeCl3 (206 mM), trichloroacetic acid (123 mM), and hydrochloric acid (249 mM). The amount of c-GH produced was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. Crystallization Crystallizations were carried out with the hanging drop vapour-diffusion method at both 21 and 4 °C. Commercial sparse matrix screen kits from Hampton Research were used for initial crystallization screening trials. For screening, a drop was usually 2 ll (1 ll ATN440 plus the same volume of well solution). Optimized drops varied at the ratio of AT-N440 to well solution from 5:1 to 9:1. The best crystals came from a drop containing 7 ll AT-N440 and 1 ll well solution. Crystals were flash-frozen for data collection by just raising the polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000 (PEG 2000 MME) concentration. Data collection A crystal was transferred into a cryobuffer solution in which the PEG 2000 MME concentration had been raised to 32%. The crystal was flash-cooled to 100 K in a stream of dry nitrogen gas. X-ray data were collected with a RAXIS-II detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 generator with Osmic confocal optics. The generator produced CuKa radiation at a power of 5 kW (59 kV, 84 mA). The data were processed using the program HKL version 1.96 [13].

Results and discussion Expression and purification of soluble amino terminal domain Results from our previous studies showed that the two opposing activities of GS-AMP deadenylylation and GS adenylylation by ATase reside on two separate but homologous N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. Moreover, based on activity measurements alone there was evidence to suggest that the two domains communicated with each other to regulate the two opposing activities; the deadenylylation activity of ATN423 depended on PII-UMP and was inhibited by PII whilst the adenylylation activity of C-terminal terminal truncation AT-C521 was PII independent [8]. However, only a small portion of the recombinant AT-N423 polypeptide was soluble, which indicated that the domain boundary was not correctly identified. The strategy employed to produce the AT-N423 fragment utilized a convenient restriction site within the glnE gene. However, this approach resulted in the AT-N423 being 17 amino acid residues short of the domain boundary based on the start position of the Q-linker QL1 (Fig. 1). In order to produce a soluble deadenylylation domain, the ATase polypeptide was truncated at the beginning of QL1 at position 440 using a PCR amplified minigene to give the extended N-terminal polypeptide AT-N440. The truncation at position 440 terminated the construct

to intact ATase (Fig. 4A) and AT-N423, the deadenylylation activity of AT-N440 is completely independent of both PII-UMP and 2-oxoglutarate (Fig. 4B). This result provides further support for the assignment of the boundary for the deadenylylation domain. No adenylylation activity was detected for AT-N440 truncation, even at two times the concentration used in the deadenylylation assay (data not shown). This clearly shows that only the deadenylylation activity is associated with the N-terminal domain.

Crystallization and X-ray analysis Reagent 13 (30% PEG2000 MME, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6) of Hampton Crystal Screen 2 gave small intergrown crystals. Following this condition, optimization by varying PEG and salt concentrations did not result in single large crystals. The home-made Clear strategy screen [14] was also used for AT-N440 initial screening. Small crystals were observed from the condition number 6 (25% PEG2000 MME and 0.8 M sodium formate) at acetate buffer, pH 4.5. Finally, the best crystals of AT-N440 were obtained at 21°C by mixing 7 ll protein solution (10 mg/ml) with 1 ll reservoir solution containing 22% PEG 2000 MME, 0.6 M sodium formate, and 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (Fig. 5).  The AT-N440 crystals diffract to 2.6 A and diffraction could be processed in the point group p321 with unit-cell   parameters a ¼ b ¼ 116:7 A, c ¼ 67:7 A, a ¼ b ¼ 90°, c ¼ 120°. The systematic absences in the intensities of axial reflections indicated that the correct space group was P31 21 or P32 21. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The data collection statistics are outlined in Table 1. Concluding remarks The retention of deadenylylation activity by ATN440 indicates that the domain boundary has been

in a predicted loop region, resulting in dramatic increase in solubility of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2). The purification of AT-N440 was dramatically improved by including the hydrophobic interaction chromatography step (HIC) (Fig. 3). When this step was followed up with anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography (see Methods), the purity of AT-N440 was at least 97% pure as judged on an SDS­PA gel stained with Coomassie blue. The yield of purified AT-N440 protein was approximately 20 mg starting from a 5 l cell culture. Deadenylylation activity The truncated fragment AT-N440 was examined for its deadenylylation activity in the assay based on the formation of c-glutamyl hydroxymate (c-GH) by unadenylylated GS. This reaction is dependent on the low nitrogen signal protein PII-UMP plus the allosteric effector 2-oxoglutarate. As previously shown, the deadenylylation of GS-AMP catalysed by the N-terminal construct AT-N423, like the intact ATase, requires the presence of PII-UMP and 2-oxoglutarate [8]. In contrast

correctly identified. Intact ATase and the partially soluble domain AT-N423 need PII-UMP and 2OG to stimulate the deadenylylation activity. Intriguingly, the purified and fully soluble domain AT-N440 is independent of the nitrogen status monitor just like the C-terminal truncation (AT-C521) that carries out adenylylation activity independent of PII. It is not clear why the activity of AT-N423 is dependent upon PII and 2OG and that of AT-N440 is independent of effectors. We suggest that AT-N423 may be stabilized and its solubility increased by the presence of effectors and that this may have resulted in an apparent dependence of activity upon effectors.
