Abstract A flexible loop of amino acids (loop II) closes over the active site of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) as the enzyme approaches the transition state [Biochemistry 37 (1998) 17120]. Formerly, the deletion of much of loop II from the HPRT of Trypanosoma cruzi resulted in a 2 ­ 3 order of magnitude reduction in kcat values with relatively modest changes in the Michaelis constants for substrates [Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1537 (2001) 63 ­ 70]. However, the contributions of individual loop II residues to catalysis remained poorly understood or have been disputed. Herein, saturation mutagenesis was used to generate relatively random sets of mutations in the 12 residues of active site loop II in the HPRT from T. cruzi and steady-state kinetics was used to investigate reactions catalyzed by the mutants. The results of analyses of 18 different mutations in an evolutionarily invariant Ser ­ Tyr dipeptide are consistent with interactions, between main chain nitrogen atoms of these residues and the O1A atom of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) or pyrophosphate (PPi), being essential for efficient enzyme chemistry. The results of analyses of 55 mutations in the nine other amino acids in loop II are inconsistent with these residues participating directly in enzyme chemistry, but are consistent with several of their side chains influencing loop flexibility and folding, as well as the efficiency for nucleotide formation relative to pyrophosphorolysis.

in salvage pathways that recycle preformed purine bases. Protozoan parasites like Trypanosoma cruzi lack the enzymes required for the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides, and thus must rely on the enzymes in salvage pathways for the synthesis of purine nucleotides. A well-characterized enzyme in these pathways is the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; EC 2.4.2.8; inosine monophosphate:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase), sometimes referred to as a hypoxanthine-guanine or hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase [1]. In the forward reaction, the enzyme catalyzes the removal of pyrophosphate (PPi) from phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) and the attachment of a purine base (hypoxanthine, guanine, or xanthine) to form a purine nucleotide, inosine monophosphate (IMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP), or xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), respectively (Scheme 1). For those HPRTs which have been studied kinetically, the reaction has been shown to proceed via an ordered Bi ­ Bi mechanism in which PRPP binds first to the enzyme followed by a purine base in the forward reaction [1]. Previous reports show that the release of products also is ordered with PPi leaving first,

followed by a nucleoside monophosphate. For the human HPRT, product release is the rate-limiting step in the reaction [2]. The reverse reaction is referred to as pyrophosphorolysis. The HPRTs of mammals have been extensively investigated because defects in the human enzyme can result in gouty arthritis [3,4] or Lesch­ Nyhan syndrome [5,6]. The enzymes from protozoa have been investigated because they are potential targets for drugs in the treatment of diseases like malaria, Chagas' disease, and giardiasis. Prior to 1998, prevalent dogma suggested that the HPRT catalyzed reaction occurs via SN1 type chemistry with the formation of an unstable ribooxycarbenium intermediate that is covalently linked to neither pyrophosphate nor a purine base [1]. However, nontraditional diagrams for the transition state of an SN1 HPRT reaction have been published [7,8] leading to potential confusion about the distinction between SN1 and SN2 chemistry in that the diagrams are inconsistent with the breakage and formation of bonds with pyrophosphate and purine substrates being temporally distinct events. In contrast, recent crystal structures of HPRTs in closed conformations provided evidence for the reaction occurring via SN2 type chemistry [9,10], as proposed in Scheme 1. This possibility was further supported by the absence of observable stabilizing interactions between HPRTs and the positive charge on the ribose moiety of a ``transition-state'' nucleotide analog [8] in the crystal structures of the human and malarial enzymes [11,12]. The X-ray crystal structures of the HPRTs from a number of organisms have been reported [7,9 ­ 18]. These structures show that the active sites of HPRTs are defined partly by four loops. Active site loop IV participates in the binding of purines or the purine moieties of nucleotides. This loop contains an invariant aspartate (D193 in the human enzyme) which forms a direct protein metal bond with a magnesium

atom in structures with more than one substrate ligand bound [9 ­ 12]. This metal (M2 in Fig. 1) is also coordinated with two oxygen atoms of the PPi and one of its coordinated water molecules contributes to the purine binding domain by forming a hydrogen bond with the N3 atom of bound purine substrates. Active site loop III forms the binding pocket for the ribose and 5V -phosphate moieties of PRPP and purine nucleotides. The amino acids in this loop comprise the most wellconserved domain in phosphoribosyltransferases, referred to as the PRPP binding motif. Active site loop I is composed of three amino acids and possesses a non-proline cis-peptide between the first two residues in the loop. Analysis of the crystal structures of closed conformations of HPRTs reveals that main chain atoms of active site loop I participate in binding a metal coordinated water molecule and oxygen atoms of the PPi moiety of substrates [9­ 12]. Active site loop II is a long flexible loop that closes over the active site in structures of enzymes approaching the transition state [9­ 12]. In addition to isolating the reaction from bulk solvent, this loop contributes to positioning substrates for efficient chemistry and participates in the binding and liberation of PPi [9,19]. Loop II contains 11­ 12 residues, which often yield poor or incomplete electron density in X-ray crystal structures where the active sites are not closed [7,16,18]. This loop contains two invariant residues (homologous with the human Ser103 and Tyr104) and one conserved residue (Ser109). The deletion of much of active site loop II from the HPRT of T. cruzi (analogous with Tyr104 through Ser109 of the human HPRT) resulted in a 2­ 3 order of magnitude reduction in kcat values with relatively modest changes in the Michaelis constants for substrates [19]. Loop deletion provided an assessment of the global contributions of loop II to catalysis but did not yield

information about the contributions of individual residues to catalysis. In an effort to further illuminate the functional roles for amino acids in active site loop II, these residues were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, and steady-state kinetics was used to analyze the forward and reverse reactions catalyzed by the mutant enzymes. Two earlier papers have investigated the functional roles of the invariant Ser ­Tyr dipeptide in loop II of the analogous enzymes of other protozoan parasites [20,21]. However, the results of the site-directed mutagenesis and steadystate kinetic studies differed dramatically between the two papers, particularly with respect to the reported turnover rates or kcat values for the mutant enzymes. For the present study, steady-state kinetic parameters were determined for reactions catalyzed by 73 mutant forms of the HPRT from T. cruzi, including 18 amino acid substitutions within the Ser­ Tyr dipeptide. Thus, the results of the present studies help to clarify earlier discrepancies about structure/function relationships for the invariant Ser ­Tyr dipeptide and further contribute to our understanding of the functional roles of the loop II residues in the catalytic mechanism of HPRTs.

Saturation mutagenesis The procedures for conducting saturation mutagenesis of loop II residues in the trypanosomal HPRT have been described previously [25]. For the present study, mutagenic fragments of DNA encoding part of the HPRT from T. cruzi were synthesized in PCRs using the universal forward M13 primer (M13UF; GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GT) and one of 12 different mutagenic coding (sense) sequence primers. The 12 mutagenic primers were S102SAT (5V -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC NNS TCA TAT GGT GAA GG-3V ), S103SAT (5V -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA NNS TAT GGT GAA GGT CTC-3V Y104SAT (5V ), -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA TCA NNS GGT GAA GGT CTC AC-3V G105SAT (5V ), -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA ), TCA TAT NNS GAA GGT CTC ACG AG-3V E106SAT (5V ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA TCA TAT GGT NNS GGT CTC ACG AGC-3V G106bSAT (5V ), -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA TCA TAT GGT GAA NNS CTC ACG AGC TCC-3V L107SAT (5V ), -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA TCA TAT GGT GAA GGT NNS ACG AGC TCC GGT C-3V T108SAT (5V ), -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA TCA TAT GGT GAA GGT CTC NNS AGC TCC GGT CAG-3V S109SAT (5V ), -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA TCA TAT GGT GAA GGT CTC ACG NNS TCC GGT CAG GTG-3V S110SAT (5V ), -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA TCA TAT GGT GAA GGT CTC ACG AGC NNS GGT CAG GTG CGC-3V G111SAT (5V ), -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA TCA TAT GGT GAA GGT CTC ACG AGC TCC NNS CAG GTG CGC ATG-3V and Q112SAT ), (5V -ATA GAA TTC ATT TGC GTC TCA TCA TAT GGT GAA GGT CTC ACG AGC TCC GGT NNS GTG CGC ATG TTG C-3V These primers contain a mixture of bases (N ).

2. Methods and materials 2.1. Materials Restriction endonucleases, calf intestinal alkaline phosphate (CIP), and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DTaqR DNA polymerase and nucleotides for PCR were purchased from United States Biochemicals (Cleveland, OH). Custom oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Gibco-BRL. Xanthine oxidase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN). GMP-agarose, PRPP, PPi, GMP, IMP, Hx, and G were from Sigma Chemical. Escherichia coli strain SØ609 (ara, Dprogpt-lac, thi, hpt, deoD, pur H, J, strA) [22] was provided by

or S, where N = A, T, G, or C, and S = G or C) for the mutagenic codon, and each was designed to yield thermal stability in the range of 40 ­44j C for duplex formation downstream of the mutagenic site. The PCRs yield fragments of the trypanosomal HPRT cDNA sequence possessing restriction endonuclease recognition sequences for EcoRI and PstI. These sites enabled the fragments to be digested and ligated into purified expression plasmids[19] for which the corresponding EcoRI and PstI DNA fragment had been removed. The libraries of plasmids were amplified in the DH5a strain of E. coli prior to screening for plasmids expressing active recombinant enzyme. 2.3. Recombinant complement selection Mutants with z 5% of the activity of wild-type HPRT can be identified by their ability to complement genetic deficiencies in bacterial auxotrophs [25]. For mutations at positions homologous with the human residues 103, 104, and 109, very few colonies could be recovered from selective media. For the nine nonconserved positions in loop II, most mutants would grow on the semi-defined selective media, suggesting that they possess at least 5% of the wild-type activity [25]. Thus, in order obtain a relatively random assortment of mutants, for this study all of the isolates were randomly picked for DNA sequencing [26] from colonies growing on nonselective nutrient media (NZCYM) supplemented with adenine (15 Ag/ml), guanosine (30 Ag/ml), ampicillin (100 Ag/ml), and streptomycin (25 Ag/ml) as described [25]. 2.4. Expression and purification of recombinant HPRTs High-level recombinant protein expression was achieved as described [24] with modifications that included the addition of 15 Ag/ml of adenine and 30 Ag/ml of guanosine to the media [27]. Recombinant enzymes were purified by affinity chromatography using GMP-agarose [24]. Once the recombinant enzyme was bound to 5 ml of GMP-agarose and the column washed with 100 ml of buffer, the enzyme that was recovered after elution with GMP was consistently >98% pure. Enzyme concentrations were determined by absorbance at A280 and by the Bradford method using immunoglobulin G (IgG) as the standard protein (Protein Assay Kit, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 2.5. Steady-state kinetics Steady-state kinetic parameters for forward reactions were determined by spectrophotometric methods as described [25,28]. All measurements were carried out in 100 mM Tris ­ HCl, pH 7.5 and 12 mM MgCl2 at 37 jC. Initial velocities were determined at various substrate concentrations in the presence of an excess (5 Â Km) of the second substrate at a fixed concentration. The kinetic parameters for PRPP were determined with hypoxanthine as the fixed substrate. Due to problems with solubility and baseline

absorbance, hypoxanthine and guanine were not tested at concentrations above 300 AM. Thus, the Michaelis constants (Km values) above f 55 AM for hypoxanthine or guanine, reported for specific mutants (S102P, S103GorR, Y104F, G105L, L107M, S109KorW G111A,E,S, Q112E), were calculated without data points approaching Vmax, and kinetic parameters for PRPP were determined with the concentration of hypoxanthine fixed below 5 Â Km. This may have contributed to discrepancies in kcat values determined for the same reactions, with variable hypoxanthine or PRPP. Michaelis (Km), standard errors, and catalytic (kcat) constants were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using the program ``EnzymeKinetics'' (copyright 1990, 1991 by Jacek Stanislawski, from Trinity Software, Campton, NH). Specific activities and kinetic parameters for reverse reactions (IMP pyrophosphorolysis) also were determined using a spectrophotometric assay [25,28,29]. The formation of hypoxanthine from IMP was determined indirectly by measuring the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine to uric acid in the presence of xanthine oxidase. The assay mixture contained 100 mM Tris ­ HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 units/ml xanthine oxidase. IMP concentrations were varied in the presence of an excess PPi (500 mM for wild-type enzyme and 1000 mM for the mutants). Initial velocities were monitored at 293 nm at 37 jC. A molar extinction coefficient of 12,000 MÀ 1 cmÀ 1 was assumed for uric acid at 293 nm [30]. Km and kcat values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the program ``EnzymeKinetics'' (copyright 1990, 1991 by Jacek Stanislawski, from Trinity Software, Campton, NH).

3. Results and discussion In a single experiment, site-directed mutagenesis can be used to generate multiple random amino acid substitutions at a selected site in a protein [25]. For the present study, 12 separate PCRs were employed to generate relatively random sets of mutations in each of 12 different codons for amino acids in active site loop II of the HPRT from T. cruzi. Sitedirected amino acid substitutions of one amino acid for another might have provided additional useful data. However, from a practical standpoint, the generation of mutations one at a time would not have easily enabled the analysis of 73 different amino acid substitutions. The diversity of amino acids that occur naturally in active site loop II residues of HPRTs from various organisms is summarized in Table 1 along with a list of the site-directed mutants analyzed in this study. Analysis of crystal structures of HPRTs approaching the transition state [9 ­12] reveals that the side chains of residues that are structurally analogous with the human S103 and S109 share interactions with a water molecule (``C'' in Fig. 1) that is hydrogen-bonded to the 5V phosphate of underlying substrates. Although there are five residues between S103 and S109 in the human enzyme, there are six amino acids in the analogous location

3.1. Analyses of amino acid substitutions at conserved sites in active site loop II Saturation site-directed mutagenesis [25] was employed to generate a relatively random set of amino acid substitutions for each of the three most conserved residues in active site loop II of the HPRT from T. cruzi. The reactions catalyzed by a total of 24 mutants (11 for S103, 7 for Y104, and 6 for S109) were analyzed kinetically for both IMP formation and IMP pyrophosphorolysis (Tables 2 and 3). The results show why mutations at positions 103 and 104 have never been observed to occur naturally in the HPRTs of distantly related organisms, from bacteria to protists to mammals. Also, the results are consistent with only polar amino acids (Gln, Ser, Thr and Tyr) having been observed to occur at position 109 among all HPRT sequences reported to Genbank, Table 1). Almost every mutation at any one of the three sites resulted in recombinant enzyme with less than 5% of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the wild-type enzyme. In most cases the low catalytic efficiencies were due to the low turnover rate (kcat value) for the mutant enzyme. An unexpected result from this study was that every substitution at any one of the three conserved positions in active site loop II resulted in a Michaelis constant (Km) for PRPP that was equal to or below that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 2), but the reductions in Km values were inadequate to account for the observed changes in kcat's, even if PRPP release were the rate-limiting step for pyrophosphorolysis reactions. This means that all of the mutants achieved half the maximal velocity for their reaction at a concentration of PRPP that was equal or below that required for the wild-type enzyme, and suggests that the wild-type residues at all three positions achieve optimal turnover rates at a cost of requiring slightly higher concentrations of PRPP for efficient chemistry. 3.2. Analysis of mutations at position 103 The well-defined crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme from T. cruzi [9] shows that the side chain hydroxyl moiety of serine at position 103 forms a hydrogen bond with both a water molecule (``C'' in Fig. 1) and the main chain carbonyl of glutamine at position 112. This water molecule is also within hydrogen bonding distance of two other atoms. One of these is an oxygen atom of the 5Vphosphate moiety of PRPP and the other is the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine at position 109. In addition, the main chain nitrogen of S103 forms a hydrogen bond with the O1A atom of PRPP (Fig. 1). Thus, mutations at position 103 could alter both main chain interactions with the O1A of PRPP and side chain interactions with the water molecule and the carbonyl moiety of Q112. Every substitution at position 103 had a devastating effect on catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and only glycine or valine at this site resulted in less than a 95% reduction in kcat values (Tables 1 and 2). Whether this is due to a change in the rate of product release or to changes in other steps in

a Data were harvested from the amino acid sequences of HPRTs reported to Genbank from more than 40 species, excluding those of Neisseria meningitides, Methanosarcina acetivorans, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum for which the hpt genes may have a novel ancestral origin [31]. Amino acids shown in bold type occur somewhat more often (z4 times among the sequenced genes) than do others at that position, and those that occur far more frequently are underlined. b Dashes at position 106-b indicate that there is no residue at this position in the HPRTs of mammals and a few other organisms.

in the HPRTs of several bacterial species as well as the HPRT from T. cruzi. Analysis of reported crystal structures indicates that the extra residue in the trypanosomal enzyme occurs at a position just downstream of the residue analogous with the human N106. Since the human numbering system is used herein to identify loop II residues, the extra amino acid in the trypanosomal enzyme is identified in the text and all tables as 106b (Tables 1 ­4). Formerly, a variety of methods, including pre-steadystate kinetics, were employed to establish that product release is the rate-limiting step for the human HPRT [2]. Although comparable studies have not been conducted for the HPRT of T. cruzi, it is likely that a similar mechanism exists for this enzyme as well. For the present study, steadystate kinetics studies were used to determine kinetic parameters for the 73 mutant forms of the HPRT from T. cruzi. A limitation of this approach was that the results did not reveal the rate-limiting step for reactions catalyzed by mutant forms of the enzyme, and changes in the binding affinities of substrates or products could also alter the existing ratelimiting step or lead to a new rate-limiting step in the reaction. With this in mind, the results of steady-state kinetics studies still can provide considerable insight into the functional roles for individual residues in the enzymecatalyzed reaction.

Amino acids are numbered according to structurally analogous residues in the human HPRT.

the catalytic mechanism cannot be determined from the present results. Also, the Km's for PRPP were surprisingly low for both the S103C and S103G mutants. The fact that the flexible residue glycine at this position yields the lowest Km for PRPP suggests that the interaction involving the main chain nitrogen, rather than that involving the side chain, is responsible for the reaction achieving Vmax/2 at a relatively low concentration of PRPP. Cysteine is a structural analog of serine, but the low kcat values with this mutant suggest that the sulfhydryl group probably does not interact with the crystallographic water molecule (``C'' in Fig. 1) observed to interact also with the 5V -phosphate group of PRPP in the crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme [9]. One possibility is that the cysteine side chain could be involved in another interaction that alters the position of the main chain nitrogen of this residue. Structures of HPRTs with IMP or GMP bound show no interactions between active site loop II residues and the bound nucleotide substrates [7,14,18]. Thus, it is difficult to explain why the Km's for IMP in enzymes, with substitutions of D, E, F or R at position 103, are so low relative to the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). Possibly, the aspartate and glutamate side chains at position 103 form interactions that alter the normal role of loop II in binding nucleotides. S103D, S103E, and S103F all yield very high Km's for PPi, which suggests that these side chain substitutions could interfere with normal loop II functions and affect the main chain interactions with the O1A atom of PPi. However, since turnover rates are extraordinarily low for all of these mutants, and the rate-limiting step is not known, interpretations of changes in Km values must be tentative. 3.3. Analysis of mutations at position 104

while the main chain nitrogen of this residue forms a hydrogen bond with the O1A of PRPP [9]. These interactions position the aromatic ring of Y104 nearly perpendicular to the ribose ring of PRPP and directly above the location of the glycosidic bond that would be formed or broken during catalysis. Thus, the aromatic ring of tyrosine helps to isolate the reaction center from bulk solvent and could provide partial electrostatic stabilization for a positively charged intermediate in an SN1-type reaction [1]. Excepting the reactions catalyzed by Y104W in which PPi was the variable substrate, tryptophan was the only mutant at position 104 that yielded relatively modest decreases (three- to sevenfold) in kcat values for substrates of forward and reverse reactions catalyzed by the enzyme (Tables 2 and 3). Since the hydroxyl of the wild-type Y104 forms a hydrogen bond with the 5Vphosphate of either PRPP or a nucleotide, this interaction likely helps to position the side chain during loop closure. Possibly, the large aromatic side chain of tryptophan has a better chance for being appropriately positioned because of van der Waals interactions with other residues as loop II closes. In contrast, phenylalanine at this position yielded 10­ 23- and 29­ 40fold reductions in kcat values for substrates of the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. One interpretation of these results is that the side chain interaction of Y104 with the 5Vphosphate may not be essential for chemistry, but this interaction may be important for positioning both the side chain and main chain atoms of this residue. Failure of Y104 to form the hydrogen bond interaction between the main chain nitrogen and the O1A atom of either PRPP or PPi appears to result in major reductions in the turnover rate in both directions of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. 3.4. Analysis of mutations at position 109

The crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme [9] shows that the side chain hydroxyl of Y104 forms a hydrogen bond with an oxygen atom of the 5Vphosphate moiety of PRPP,

As mentioned above, the side chain hydroxyl moieties of S109 and S103 form hydrogen bonds with the water

molecule (``C'' in Fig. 1) that is also hydrogen-bonded to the 5Vphosphate of PRPP. These interactions likely facilitate closure and positioning of active-site loop II as the enzyme approaches the transition state. A surprising result was that alanine at position 109 had a less deleterious effect on catalytic activity than glycine at this position (Tables 2 and 3). The side chain of the wildtype S109 projects toward residues near the amino terminus of loop II and possibly the alanine side chain is able to form van der Waals interactions that contribute favorably to loop closure. The activity of the S109A mutant shows that the side chain of the wild-type residue at position 109 likely has an important role in loop closure, but not in enzyme chemistry. If nucleotide release were the ratelimiting step for the HPRT of T. cruzi, the elevated Km for IMP by the S109A mutant would be expected to favorably influence kcat values, if at all. Thus, the relative turnover rates for S109A provide a basis for estimating the minimal contribution (two- to fourfold increases in kcat values) of the serine hydroxyl to the turnover rate of the reaction. 3.5. Interpretations of structure/function relationships for conserved residues in loop II The results and interpretations reported here are in stark disagreement with those from a mutation study of the invariant Ser­ Tyr dipeptide in active site loop II of analogous enzymes from the protozoan parasites, Tritrichomonas foetus and Giardia lamblia [21]. This earlier study reported no significant changes in kcat values for S103A and Y104F substitutions in the enzymes from both parasites, and for Y104E and Y104W substitutions in the enzyme from T. foetus. This result is difficult to reconcile with the fact that evolution has strongly selected for serine and tyrosine at positions 103 and 104 in all phosphoribosyltransferases that salvage 6-oxopurines [1]. The differences between the

results reported here and those of this earlier study cannot be easily explained. In contrast, the data reported herein are consistent with that from the kinetic analysis of site directed mutations at positions 103 (four mutants) and 104 (two mutants) in the analogous enzyme from Leishmania donovani [20], including that all of the mutations in the Leishmanial enzyme yielded Km's for PRPP that were equal or below those for the wild-type enzyme. However, the interpretations of the functional roles for S103 and Y104 in the enzyme from L. donovani differ significantly with those reported here. In part this may be due to the fact that the earlier study did not have the benefit or knowledge about any of the closed conformation crystals structures subsequently reported for HPRTs [9 ­12]. All four of these crystal structures show details of atomic interactions involving residues analogous with positions 103, 104, and 109 and this structural data contributed enormously to the interpretations (above) of structure/function relationships. Thus, the analyses herein of the site-directed mutations at positions 103, 104, and 109 provide significant new details to enhance our understanding of the functional roles in catalysis for each of the conserved amino acids in active site loop II of HPRTs. In summary, the kinetic data for mutations at position 104, taken together with the mutational analyses of S103, are consistent with an interpretation that interactions between the main chain nitrogen atoms of residues, at both positions 103 and 104, and the O1A atom of PRPP or PPi are essential to achieve a reasonable turnover rate and efficient enzyme chemistry, both for IMP formation and IMP pyrophosphorolysis. These interactions likely contribute indirectly to the proper positioning of substrates for efficient chemistry, but they also conceivably could contribute to stabilization of a partial negative charge on the O1 atom of PRPP during the transition state of an SN2 reaction. However, these interactions would not be expected to contribute to the nucleophilic behavior of

pyrophosphate in nucleotide pyrophosphorolysis via an SN1 type reaction. The data for site-directed mutations at residue 109 are consistent with the side chain at this position not participating directly in enzyme chemistry but having an important functional role in the closure and positioning of active-site loop II as the enzyme approaches the transition state. 3.6. Analyses of amino acid substitutions at nonconserved positions in active site loop II 3.6.1. Mutations at position S102 Five different amino acid replacements were analyzed for position 102. Although the Km's for PRPP, IMP, and PPi with the S102P HPRT are significantly below those of the wildtype enzyme (Tables 2 and 3), dramatic reductions in catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) for this mutant indicate that main chain flexibility is essential at position 102 of the trypanosomal enzyme. Furthermore, the deleterious effects of substitutions of glycine, histidine, leucine, and valine at position 102 are consistent with side chain interactions at position 102 contributing modestly to efficient enzyme chemistry. 3.6.2. Mutations at position G105 As summarized in Table 4, all of the amino acid replacements at position 105 were relatively deleterious ( < 60% of the catalytic efficiency for wild type) for IMP formation,

indicating that glycine may be the preferred residue at this position. An interesting result was that methionine at this position did not severely affect pyrophosphorolysis and may improve turnover rates (kcat's) for both IMP formation and pyrophosphorolysis (Tables 2 and 3). Also, elevated Km's for PRPP and IMP are consistent with reduced affinities for these ligands as products and could potentially contribute to the enhanced turnover rates for the G105M mutant. A crystal structure of the trypanosomal HPRT [9] shows that the main chain carbonyl of G105 forms a hydrogen bond with one of the water molecules in the coordination sphere of a magnesium ion (M2 in Fig. 1) that in turn could influence the positions of a bound purine base, PRPP or PPi. Possibly, side chain interactions of methionine at position 105 affect the geometry of the coordination sphere of this metal, slightly altering the positions of substrates in a way that favors the turnover rate of the enzyme. 3.6.3. Mutations at position E106 Although IMP formation was deleteriously affected by the substitutions of phenylalanine, glycine, lysine, glutamine, and cysteine at position 106, glycine, lysine, and glutamine replacements appeared to enhance the efficiency for pyrophosphorolysis (Tables 2 ­4) as well as the majority of the kcat values for both IMP formation and pyrophosphorolysis (Tables 2 and 3). The implication is that side chain interactions at position 106 can affect folding and closure of loop II and indirectly influence the positions of bound substrates in the active site. 3.6.4. Mutations at position G106b The main chain carbonyl of G106b forms a hydrogen bond with an active site water molecule that also is hydrogen-bonded to one of the waters in the coordination sphere of the magnesium ion (M2 in Fig. 1) that can influence the positions of purines, PRPP, and PPi as mentioned above in the section about mutations at position G105. With the exception of isoleucine and valine, substitutions at this position, (alanine, glutamate, leucine, tryptophan, and to a lesser extent aspartate) resulted in improved turnover rates for both IMP formation and pyrophosphorolysis while alanine and tryptophan replacements led to improved efficiencies for pyrophosphorolysis (Tables 2 and 3). There is no correlation between the polarity of side chains and whether they have a positive or negative impact on the efficiency of catalysis. These results are consistent with the side chain at position 106b not being directly involved in enzyme chemistry, but being able to influence (through van der Waals interactions) the folding of loop II, and the positions of underlying substrates, as the enzyme approaches the transition state. 3.6.5. Mutations at position L107 Main chain and side chain atoms of L107 form van der Waals contacts with F186, which in turn forms van der Waals contacts with the six-membered ring of purine substrates [9].

However, there appears to be considerable flexibility for the identity of the amino acid at position 107 in active site loop II and some substitutions (notably A, I, M, S, or T) may significantly improve the relative catalytic efficiency of pyrophosphorolysis reactions (Tables 2 ­ 4). 3.6.6. Mutations at position T108 The carbonyl oxygen of T108 forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule that is also hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl of Y104 (Fig. 1). Also, main chain atoms of T108 form van der Waals contacts with the side chain of Y104, but none of these interactions involve the side chain of the residue at position 108 [9]. With the possible exception of glycine, various substitutions at this site had modest effects on catalytic efficiencies (Tables 2 ­4). The low activity for some reactions with glycine at position 108 suggests that too much flexibility at this position could be deleterious for enzyme activity. 3.6.7. Mutations at position S110 The side chain of S110 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Q112 (Fig. 1). Tryptophan replacement at this position was mildly deleterious for purine Km's, as well as the efficiency of nucleotide formation, but was not deleterious for pyrophosphorolysis reactions (Tables 2 and 3). Although only two mutants were analyzed, the results suggest that the hydrogen bond involving the side chain of residue 110 may contribute directly to the efficient closure of loop II, and indirectly to the stable binding of purine substrates. 3.6.8. Mutations at position G111 Four mutants at position 111 were analyzed kinetically. Each of the mutants was relatively deleterious for one or more reactions catalyzed by the enzyme and glutamate at this position would probably be a lethal substitution. Although the results of steady-state kinetics studies do not permit identification of the rate-limiting step for catalysis, the relatively low Km for IMP suggests that glutamate at this site might interfere with the binding or release of nucleotide substrates and indirectly affect the kcat's for both IMP formation and pyrophosphorolysis. The data for mutations at position 111 are consistent with wild-type glycine being a preferred residue at this position. 3.6.9. Mutations at position Q112 The main chain carbonyl of Q112 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of the invariant serine at position 103 (Fig. 1). This interaction likely contributes to appropriate folding and positioning loop II as the enzyme approaches the transition state. The substitution of glutamate at position 112 may impair pyrophosphorolysis reactions. Other site-directed mutants at this position seemed either to enhance (Q112S) or reduce (Q112V or Q112Y) the efficiencies for nucleotide formation in relation to pyrophosphorolysis.

3.7. Overview of the roles of nonconserved loop II residues The results detailed in Tables 2 ­ 4 show that the side chains of many loop II residues tolerate a variety of substitutions without dramatically altering the HPRT catalyzed reaction. However, there appears to be a selective advantage for glycine occurring at positions 105 and 111 in loop II of the HPRT from T. cruzi, but there may be a selective disadvantage for glycine being at position 108. This suggests that flexibility at specific positions in loop II is important for achieving proper folding of the loop as the enzyme approaches the transition state. A surprising result of this study was that specific substitutions at positions E106, G106-b, L107, T108, and Q112 can influence kcat values and the relative efficiencies for nucleotide formation and pyrophosphorolysis. By extrapolation, this leads to a conclusion that differences in the identity of amino acids at each of these positions in the enzymes from various organisms (Table 1) could account for some of the variations in the relative efficiencies for nucleotide formation and pyrophosphorolysis reported for the HPRTs from different organisms. Overall, these results are consistent with the side chains of loop II residues indirectly affecting the positions of underlying substrates when the loop closes over the active site as the enzyme approaches the transition state of either the forward or reverse reaction. Also, the results are consistent with an HPRT catalyzed reaction in which, as formerly suggested by ´ Heroux et al. [10], substrate propinquity and optimal reactive geometry strongly influence the efficiency for catalysis.
