The ring-opening polymerization of -caprolactone catalyzed by a novel thermophilic esterase from the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus was successfully conducted in organic solvents. The effects of enzyme concentration, temperature, reaction time, reaction medium, and water activity on monomer conversion and product molecular weight were investigated. Poly( -caprolactone) was obtained in almost 100% of the monomer conversion, with a number-average molecular weight of 1400 in toluene at 80  C for 72 h. Furthermore, the Michaelis­Menten kinetic analysis showed that the enzyme had the highest affinity for -caprolactone, with a Km value of 0.093 mol/l compared with other reported lipases. The possible structural and energetic effects of the enzyme on the Km value were investigated, using molecular docking studies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Poly( -caprolactone) (PCL) is an attractive aliphatic polyester due to its favorable biodegradability, biocompatibility, and permeability characteristics [1]. While these advantages make it a good candidate for many biomedical applications, it is especially well suited for tissue-engineering scaffolds [2]. Metallic catalysts are often used in ring-opening polymerization for PCL synthesis [3]. However, concern has been raised about the harmful effects of using PCL for medical applications because of its metallic residues. Enzymatic polymerization has been used as a substitute for the toxic, metal-based catalytic systems [4­7]. Moreover, it has the advantages of mild reaction conditions, recyclability of enzymes, and high enantio- and regioselectivity [7]. Various commercially available lipases have been employed in ring-opening polymerization of -caprolactone, such as porcine pancreatic lipase, Candida rugosa lipase (lipase CR), Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (lipase PC), Candida antarctica lipase B (lipase CA) and Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase (lipase PF) [8­12]. Among them, lipase CA showed high catalytic activity towards the polymerization of -caprolactone, and the number-average molecular weight (Mn ) of PCL obtained was more than 4 × 104 [12]. Up to now, no research on esterase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of lactones has been reported except for that conducted on the cutinase from Humicola insolens, a fungal esterase with promising lactone

ring-opening polymerization activity [13]. However, because of their lack of stability, these mesophilic enzymes are not well suited for the harsh reaction conditions (such as high temperature and exposure to organic solvents) required in industrial preparation of PCL. Recently, enzymes from extremophiles, especially thermophiles, have been recognized as having the potential for organic synthesis due to their high stability against organic solvents, high temperature, and chemical denaturants. Therefore, these enzymes permit the exploration of reactions over much wider ranges of pH, temperature, and solvents without significant loss in enzymatic activity [14]. The commercial thermophilic lipases ESL-001 were once employed in the polymerization of racemic -butyrolactone and the production of optically active poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [14]. To date, many cloned thermophilic esterases have been considered as potential catalysts in industrial processes [15]. Thermophilic esterase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AFEST) has been cloned, well expressed in Escherichia coli, and characterized with respect to substrate specificity, crystal structure, and catalytic mechanism [16­19]. The enzyme was classified as a member of a hormone-sensitive lipase group of the esterase/lipase superfamily [18]. Its optimum temperature was 80  C, and the t1/2 value was 7.5 h at 70  C [17]. It could catalyze the hydrolysis of a broad range of esters, including p-nitrophenyl esters, vinyl esters, and triacylglycerols of short chain, and its best substrate was p-nitrophenyl hexanoate among the p-nitrophenyl esters tested [17,19]. Its wide substrate specificity and unique stability make it a promising candidate for potential industrial applications. In the present study, we first reported the ring-opening polymerization of -caprolactone catalyzed by thermophilic esterase

AFEST. Reaction conditions were optimized to obtain high yield and high product molecular weight. Using Michaelis­Menten kinetic analysis, we gained deeper insight into the mechanism of enzymatic catalysis. In addition, we performed molecular docking studies to elucidate the possible structural and energetic basis of the high affinity of the enzyme for the monomer. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials -Caprolactone was purchased from Fluka and used without further purification. The organic solvents used in enzymatic poly° merization were of analytical grade and dried over a 4 A molecular sieve before use. Isopropyl -d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and p-nitrophenyl caprylate were purchased from Sigma. All the other chemicals were of the highest reagent grade commercially available. 2.2. Purification of the recombinant enzyme AFEST The recombinant E. coli BL21 harboring AF1716 from the archaeon A. fulgidus was a generous gift of Dr. Giuseppe Manco (Istituto di Biochimica delle Proteine, Italy). It was cultured in 2YT medium (1% yeast extract, 1.6% tryptone, and 0.5% NaCl) containing ampicillin (100 g/ml) at 37  C. After incubation with shaking at 37  C until the OD600 (optical density of liquid medium at 600 nm) reached 1.8, the induction was carried out by adding IPTG at a final concentration of 1 mM and shaking for an additional 3 h at 37  C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 4  C, 30 min), washed with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and stored at -20  C. The frozen cells were melted and mixed with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). After ultrasonic cell disintegration, the suspension was thermoprecipitated by incubation at 80  C for 30 min. The crude extract was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min, and the pellet was discarded. The enzyme solution was ultrafiltrated under a 20 kDa microporous filter membrane. The solution was then lyophilized, and the enzyme powder was used as the catalyst. SDS-PAGE and analysis of the gel with an ARTHUR 1442 multiwavelength fluoroimager indicated that the enzyme was about 92% pure, with a molecular mass of 35.5 kDa (data not shown). 2.3. Enzyme assay The time course of the esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of pnitrophenyl caprylate was followed by monitoring the production of p-nitrophenyl at 405 nm in 1 cm path length cells with a double-beam Varian Cary 50 ultraviolet­visible spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller. The substrate p-nitrophenyl caprylate was dissolved in acetonitrile at a concentration of 10 mM. In the standard assay, 20 l of 10 mM p-nitrophenyl caprylate solution was added to the reaction system to a final concentration of 0.2 mM in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) incubated at 80  C; the reaction was initiated by adding 20 l of enzyme solution. The background hydrolysis of the substrate was deducted using a reference sample of identical composition to the incubation mixture, except that the esterase was omitted. One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of protein releasing 1 mol p-nitrophenyl from p-nitrophenyl caprylate per min. 2.4. Enzymatic polymerization of -caprolactone

then placed into a thermostatic reactor with stirring (180 rpm). Reaction was terminated by adding dichloromethane and filtrating to remove the enzyme. The enzyme was washed several times with dichloromethane, and the filtrates were collected and diluted to10 ml with dichloromethane. We used 1 ml of the organic phase to measure the monomer conversion by gas chromatography (GC). The other solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to remove dichloromethane, and the remaining viscous sample was precipitated in methanol at -20  C. The cloudy solution was centrifuged (8000 rpm, 15 min, 4  C), and the white precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven (0.1 mmHg, 25  C, 24 h). The product obtained was then characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), 1 H and 13 C NMR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). 2.5. Determination of monomer conversion The monomer conversion was determined with a Shimadzu 2014 gas chromatograph equipped with an Rtx-1 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 m) and hydrogen flame ionization detector. The temperatures of the injection pool and detector were set at 200 and 240  C, respectively. The column oven temperature was held at 70  C for 2 min and then programmed to rise at 10  C/min to a final temperature of 140  C, which was maintained for 2 min. The injection volume was 1.0 l. Butyl acetate was used as the internal standard to determine the monomer conversion values, which were measured in duplicate. 2.6. Determination of molecular weight and polydispersity index The Mn and polydispersity index (PDI) of the products were measured by GPC using a conventional calibration technique. The calibration curve was generated from polystyrene standards with molecular weights of 5.00 × 102 , 2.10 × 103 , 4.92 × 103 , 9.92 × 103 , 6.63 × 104 , 9.60 × 104 , and 9.56 × 105 . Analyses were carried out using a Waters HPLC system equipped with a refractive index detec° tor (model 410) and 103 , 104 , and 105 A Ultrastyragel columns in series. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The sample was filtrated under 0.22 m micropore film. The sample concentration and injection volume were 0.3% (w/v) and 20 l, respectively. The values were the average of duplicate measurements. 2.7. Structural and thermal analysis of PCL The structure of the polymer was characterized by FT-IR, and and 13 C NMR. FT-IR spectrum was recorded in the range of 4000­400 cm-1 on a Nicolet 5700 Instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA) using the standard KBr disk method. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded in chloroform-d (CDCl ) on an 3 AVANCE DMX 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz. The chemical shifts for 1 H NMR spectrum were referenced relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS, 0.00 ppm). The 13 C NMR spectrum was recorded using the distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer including the detection of quaternary nuclei (DEPTQ) program at 25  C. Preliminary thermal analysis of PCL was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer differential scanning calorimeter. DSC scans were performed in the temperature range 0­100  C, with a heating and cooling rate of 10  C/min. The crystallization temperature Tc and melting temperature Tm were taken at the peak of the DSC exoand endotherms, respectively.

2.8. Control of water activity The thermophilic esterase AFEST was dried in a desiccator overnight and transferred into a dried vessel containing 200 l caprolactone and 600 l organic solvent. The vessel was sealed and Enzyme preparations and reaction media were equilibrated with saturated salt solutions in 25 ml of separate containers,

according to Wehtje's method [20]. The water activities of the salts used were: LiCl (water activity, w = 0.11); MgCl2 (w = 0.33); Mg(NO3 )2 (w = 0.54); NaCl (w = 0.75); and Na2 SO4 (w = 0.95). Equilibration was performed at 25  C for at least 16 h. 2.9. Michaelis­Menten kinetics We followed the general procedure for the Michaelis­Menten kinetics described by Palmans and co-workers [21]. The Hanes­Woolf plot [S]/V = (Km /Vmax )+([S]/Vmax ) was selected to calculate the maximal rate of reaction Vmax and the Michaelis­Menten constant Km , where [S] represents the concentration of caprolactone. The initial rate of reaction V was calculated from the initial rate constants for each lactone concentration, which were derived from the slope of the ln(1 - conversion) versus time plot. In all cases, the amount of AFEST was kept constant at 100 mg, while the concentrations of -caprolactone were varied from 0.125 to 2.000 M in toluene. Ethylbenzene (100 l) was added as an internal standard, and the total volume was 3 ml. Samples (50 l) were taken at appropriate time intervals and analyzed by GC to determine the monomer conversion. 2.10. Molecular docking studies The structural information from the theoretically modeled complex was performed with the InsightII package, version 2000 ° (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA). The 2.2 A crystallographic struc° ture of AFEST and the 2.1 A crystallographic structure of lipase CA were used for the starting coordinates for calculations (Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, code 1JJI and 1TCA [PDB]). The 3D structure of -caprolactone was built with the Builder program and optimized using AM1 method. Docking experiments were performed with both Affinity and Autodock 4.0 programs [22,23] to increase the number of possible candidates of the binding complex. Affinity, which uses a combination of Monte Carlo-type and simulated annealing procedures to dock, is suitable for automatically docking a monomer to an enzyme [22]. The potential of complex was assigned by using the CVFF force field. To account for the solvent effect, the centered, enzyme­monomer complexes were solvated in a sphere of TIP3P ° water molecules with a radius of 10 A. This provided 10 structures from SA docking, and the conformations generated were clustered according to RMS deviation. The global structure with the lowest energy was chosen for calculating the interaction energies of the monomer with enzymes. During the Autodock 4.0 process, a conformational search was performed using the Solis and Wets local search method and the Lamarkian genetic algorithm (LGA) was applied to identify the enzyme­monomer interactions [23]. Autodock calculated enzyme­monomer interaction energies over a grid, in which size was set to be 126 × 126 × 126 and the grid space ° was the default value of 0.375 A. The Autodock method generated 10 enzyme­monomer configurations. Because the geometrical structures of these models were found to be similar, the global structure with the lowest energy was chosen to calculate the free energy of binding ( G). In the current version, the protein was treated as rigid, while the monomer was allowed torsional flexibility. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structural and thermal characterization of the product PCL The recombinant thermophilic esterase AFEST, with a specific activity of approximately 168 U/mg for p-nitrophenyl caprylate, was used as a catalyst in the ring-opening polymerization of caprolactone. The product was dried under reduced pressure and characterized by FT-IR, DSC, 1 H NMR, and DEPTQ 13 C NMR.

The structure of PCL was confirmed by FT-IR, 1 H NMR, and DEPTQ 13 C NMR. The FT-IR spectrum of PCL was shown in Fig. 1. The bands near 1724 and 1192 cm-1 resulted from C O and C O stretching vibrations, respectively. The band at 3438 cm-1 indicated the presence of a hydroxyl group, which confirmed the formation of a linear polymer chain. PCL exhibited the bands at 2945 and 2865 cm-1 , assigned to C H moiety. The 1 H NMR spectrum as shown in Fig. 2 confirmed the structure of PCL as follows: 1.38 (Hc , m, J = 8.54, 7.02 Hz); 1.65 (Hb and Hd , m, J = 7.32, 7.63, 4.88 Hz); 2.31 (Ha , t, J = 7.32 Hz); 3.65 (Hf , t, J = 6.71 Hz); and 4.06 (He , t, J = 6.71 Hz). The triplets at 4.16 ppm (trace amount) were the corresponding methylene protons in the dimmer [24]. Triplets at 2.31 and 2.37 ppm suggested the existence of a diverse mixture of linear and cyclic oligomers. By calculating the areas of peak e and f, the molecular weight of PCL obtained was 1270. The structure of PCL was characterized by DEPTQ 13 C NMR spectrum (Fig. 3) as follows: 173.8 (C O, C-1), 34.5 (CH2 , C-2), 25.9 (CH2 , C-3), 24.9 (CH2 , C-4), 28.7 (CH2 , C-5), 64.5 (CH2 O, C-6), 62.8 (CH2 OH, end group). In the spectrum, the non-protonated carbons C O (173.8 ppm) and CDCl3 (76.9 ppm) were detected as negative resonances. The preliminary thermal properties of PCL were characterized by DSC (Fig. 4). The curves indicated that a melting endotherm of PCL was at 58  C, which was consistent with the reported values

3.2. Optimization of reaction conditions 3.2.1. Effect of enzyme concentration In the enzymatic ring-opening polymerization of caprolactone, the enzyme concentration had a profound effect on both the monomer conversion rate and product molecular weight [27]. Experiments were conducted with different concentrations of AFEST and the same amount of -caprolactone (200 l) and toluene (600 l). The reactions were performed at 80  C for 72 h. Monomer conversion and Mn as a function of enzyme concentration were shown in Fig. 5. An increase in monomer conversion was observed with the increased concentration of the enzyme. When the enzyme concentration exceeded 25 mg/ml, the monomer conversion was more than 99%. However, the Mn value remained constant (ca. 1400) and independent of the enzyme concentration. Therefore, in subsequent research, 25 mg/ml of AFEST was employed in the ring-opening polymerization.

of PCL synthesized by lipase CA catalysis (54.4­60  C) [1,21,25,26]. However, the crystallization temperature Tc = 25  C was lower than that of PCL with Mn value of 9700 and PDI of 1.7 (35  C) [25], probably due to the lower PDI of the product obtained in toluene (PDI = 1.2) (Table 1).

3.2.2. Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on monomer conversion and product molecular weight was investigated at different temperatures in toluene for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 6, during the polymerization, the monomer conversion and product molecular weight were higher at 80  C than at 45  C and 60  C. After 72 h, the monomer conversion increased from 84% at 45  C to 100% at 80  C. In addition, the molecular weight of product was also higher at 80  C

The reaction systems were pre-equilibrated with saturated salt solutions of different water activity at 25  C for at least 16 h.

(Mn = 1400, PDI = 1.21) than at 45  C (Mn = 720, PDI = 1.24) and 60  C (Mn = 1050, PDI = 1.30). The increased monomer conversions and molecular weights at higher temperatures were partly caused by the decreased diffusion constraints in the reaction mixture, resulting from high viscosity of the product. More importantly, in the ring-opening polymerization, water molecules may be increasingly accessible in the chain initiation reaction, which would accelerate the rate of conversion at higher temperatures [28]. As AFEST was thermal stable, a higher temperature was beneficial to the polymerization reaction because of the higher monomer conversion and molecular weight of the polymer. 3.2.3. Effect of reaction time The polymerization reaction of -caprolactone for different time lengths was performed at 80  C to investigate the effect of reaction time on monomer conversion and product molecular weight. Polymerizations were carried out using 25 mg/ml of AFEST, 200 l -caprolactone and 600 l toluene from 1 to 120 h. Monomer conversion and Mn as a function of reaction time were shown in Fig. 7. During the polymerization, the monomer conversion and Mn increased with the reaction time. The monomer conversion reached 95% rapidly within 14 h, in which almost all the monomer engaged in the initiation process of the polymerization. However, in the process of chain propagation, Mn increased slowly from 860 at the reaction time of 14 h to 1530 when the reaction was carried out for 120 h. A comparison of the rate of initiation with that of propagation suggested that the AFEST-catalyzed polymerization was characterized by rapid initiation and slow propagation. Compared with lipase CA-catalyzed synthesis of PCL at 70  C for 4 h (yield 86%, Mn = 44,800, PDI = 1.7) [12], the products (yield 95%, Mn = 860, PDI = 1.2) catalyzed by AFEST at 80  C for 14 h were of lower molecular weight during the reaction. Therefore, the thermophilic esterase AFEST was more suitable for preparing PCL of lower molecular weight, which was expected to be widely used as the drug carrier or soft segment of polyurethanes. 3.2.4. Effect of reaction medium For enzymatic reaction in non-aqueous medium, the solvent played a crucial role in determining enzyme stability and regulating the partitioning of substrates and products between the solvent and the enzyme [28]. The effects of various organic solvents on monomer conversion and Mn at 80  C for 72 h were summarized in Table 1. Relatively lower monomer conversion was observed in hydrophilic solvents such as dioxane and acetone. In solvents having log P values from 0.93 to 3.50, efficient production of the

polymer was achieved, with nearly 100% monomer conversion. It was obvious that a higher molecular weight PCL was produced efficiently in hydrocarbon solvents (toluene, n-hexane, and cyclohexane). In toluene, PCL was obtained in almost 100% monomer conversion, with an Mn value of 1400. These results may be due to the deactivation of the enzyme by the hydrophilic solvent in a way that disrupted the functional structure or stripped off the essential water from the enzyme [28]. In addition, because dipole moment and solvent geometry might affect the enzymatic polymerization, log P values did not correlate completely with the monomer conversion and Mn . Although higher monomer conversion and Mn were obtained in solvents with high log P values (n-hexane and cyclohexane), monomer and polymer were of lower solubility in these solvents. Therefore, toluene was the best solvent for producing PCL efficiently and the most appropriate for further kinetic studies. 3.2.5. Effect of water activity A water molecule acting as a nucleophilic reagent played a key role in the chain initiation step [7,29]. Meanwhile, the limited water content was significant in controlling enzyme performance in organic medium [30]. Determining the optimum level of water in the enzymatic polymerization was desirable. In this study, we pre-equilibrated the reaction systems with saturated salt solutions

The Michaelis­Menten constant Km and the maximal rate of reaction Vmax were calculated from the interaction with y-axis and the slope of the linear fit (R2 = 0.91). The reactions were carried out at 80  C with constant enzyme concentration and different lactone concentrations in toluene.

to keep the reaction medium with different values of water activity. The reactions were carried out for 24 h, and the effect of water activity on the monomer conversion at indicated time points was investigated. As shown in Fig. 8, the highest monomer conversions were observed at the water activity of 0.75, before the monomers were completely consumed (<24 h). When the reactions proceeded for 24 h, the monomer conversions were almost 100% at water activity of 0.54­0.75. These results showed that the thermophilic esterase AFEST exhibited the bell-shaped profile of water activity (similar to lipase CR), as opposed to many other enzymes that showed high activity in systems with higher water activity [20]. 3.3. Michaelis­Menten kinetic evaluation To get insight into the kinetics of AFEST-catalyzed ringopening polymerization of -caprolactone, Km and Vmax values were determined. We used a Hanes­Woolf plot, shown in Fig. 9, to calculate Vmax and Km , which were 0.20 mol/(l h) and 0.093 mol/l, respectively. To calculate the turnover number kcat , we determined an active protein content of 92% (w/w) of the enzyme preparation and a molecular weight of 35,500 g/mol of AFEST. The kcat calculated from Vmax was 0.064 s-1 . Compared with lipase CA-catalyzed polymerization of -caprolactone at 45  C in toluene (Km = 0.72 mol/l; Vmax = 1.97 mol/(l h); and kcat = 72.9 s-1 ) [21] and lipase PF-catalyzed polymerization at 60  C in isopropyl ether (Km = 0.61 mol/l) [31], AFEST showed much higher affinity for -caprolactone. However, its catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km = 0.69 l/(mol s)) was much lower than that observed for lipase CA-catalyzed polymerization of -caprolactone (kcat /Km = 101.25 l/(mol s)). It was generally accepted that, in enzymatic ring-opening polymerization, the lactone was activated via the formation of an acyl­enzyme intermediate by the nucleophilic attack of serine residue on the lactone carbonyl. The chain initiation and propagation occurred by the deacylation of the nucleophiles, such as water molecules and terminal hydroxyl group of the growing polymer chain [32]. According to this mechanism, our data suggested that, compared with lipase CA, AFEST could incorporate the monomer into its active site more rapidly, but the formation of acyl­enzyme intermediate, and the chain initiation and propagation were much slower. 3.4. Molecular docking studies Studies of molecular docking of -caprolactone to AFEST and lipase CA were undertaken to investigate the structural and

energetic basis of the high affinity of AFEST to the monomer caprolactone. The model of the enzyme­monomer complex was developed using the Affinity module. Generally, hydrogen bonds play an important role for the stability of enzyme­substrate complex and were chosen to investigate the binding ability. As shown in Fig. 10A, hydrogen bonding interactions formed between the carbonyl group of the monomer and the active residues of AFEST. Three strong hydrogen bonds were formed between carbonyl O of -caprolactone and OH of active residue Ser160, and NH of residues of oxyanion hole (Gly88 and Gly89), respectively. In addition, NH of Ala161 of oxyanion hole formed a weak hydrogen bond with the carbonyl O of -caprolactone. Compared with AFEST, only three hydrogen bonds were formed between carbonyl O of -caprolactone and residues of oxyanion hole of lipase CA (Thr40 and Gln106) (Fig. 10B). Furthermore, the interaction energies, including the total, van der Waals and electrostatic, and the free energies of binding ( G) were calculated from Affinity and Autodock 4.0 programs, respectively (Table 2). The total energy Etotal of AFEST to the monomer (-33.81 kcal mol-1 ) was lower than that of lipase CA (-30.17 kcal mol-1 ), and the free energy of binding of AFEST, calculated from Autodock 4.0, was -5.15 kcal mol-1 , which was also lower than that of lipase CA (-3.27 kcal mol-1 ). These results suggested that AFEST had a stronger interaction with -caprolactone than lipase CA, which might lead to a higher affinity for the monomer, and they were consistent with the experimental results obtained by Michaelis­Menten kinetic analysis. 4. Conclusions In this paper, PCL was successfully synthesized using a novel thermophilic esterase AFEST from the archaeon A. fulgidus as the catalyst. The synthesized PCL was of low molecular weight, and expected to be widely used as the soft segment of polyurethanes. Compared with the reported lipases, the enzyme AFEST had the

highest affinity for -caprolactone, and this finding was validated by the theoretical modeled complex. This work could provide a new route for polyester synthesis and help to broaden the application of thermophilic esterases.
