Archaeosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (ArcTGT) catalyzes the exchange of guanine at position 15 in the D-loop of archaeal tRNAs with a free 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine (preQ0) base, as the first step in the biosynthesis of an archaea-specific modified base, archaeosine (7-formamidino-7deazaguanosine). We determined the crystal structures of ArcTGT from ° Pyrococcus horikoshii at 2.2 A resolution and its complexes with guanine ° resolutions, respectively. The N-terminal cataand preQ0, at 2.3 and 2.5 A lytic domain folds into an (a/b)8 barrel with a characteristic zinc-binding site, showing structural similarity with that of the bacterial queuosine TGT (QueTGT), which is involved in queuosine (7-{[(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2cyclopenten-1-yl)-amino]methyl}-7-deazaguanosine) biosynthesis and targets the tRNA anticodon. ArcTGT forms a dimer, involving the zincbinding site and the ArcTGT-specific C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domains have novel folds, including an OB fold-like "PUA domain", whose sequence is widely conserved in eukaryotic and archaeal RNA modification enzymes. Therefore, the C-terminal domains may be involved in tRNA recognition. In the free-form structure of ArcTGT, an a-helix located at the rim of the (a/b)8 barrel structure is completely disordered, while it is ordered in the guanine-bound and preQ0-bound forms. Structural comparison of the ArcTGT·preQ0, ArcTGT·guanine, and QueTGT·preQ1 complexes provides novel insights into the substrate recognition mechanisms of ArcTGT.

Introduction
A number of modified nucleosides have been identified in tRNAs and rRNAs.1,2 However, their biosynthesis and functions are not fully understood3 ­ 5. Queuosine (Q; 7-{[(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-yl)-amino]methyl}-7-deazaguanosine) (Figure 1(a)), is chemically distinctive, due to its 7-deazaguanine structure and its hypermodification.6 Q and related nucleotides (ManQ and GalQ) are located exclusively at the first position of the anticodons of tRNATyr, tRNAHis, tRNAAsp, and tRNAAsn from bacteria and eukaryotes, except for some organisms such as yeast.6 Therefore, the Q modifications may be relevant to the codon recognition properties of the tRNAs.7,8 On the other hand, the crystal structure of Q

suggested that the 7-substituent group protrudes from the anticodon in the direction opposite that of the codon recognition.9 Q may therefore be involved in some biological processes other than protein biosynthesis, such as development, differentiation, aging, and cancer.3,10 ­ 12 The biosynthesis of Q is carried out on tRNA molecules by a base-exchange reaction, which is catalyzed by queuosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (QueTGT). In bacteria, the QueTGT catalyzes the replacement of the guanine base at the first position of the anticodon (position 34) of tRNA with a free precursor, 7-aminomethyl-7deazaguanine (preQ1).13,14 The preQ1-tRNA is

further modified to Q by several steps15 ­ 17 (Figure 1(a)). In contrast, the eukaryotic QueTGT incorporates a fully-modified Q base into position 34 of the tRNA by a single base-exchange reaction.18 QueTGT cleaves the N-glycosidic bond of the ribose to the guanine base and regenerates that to the modified base, without consuming any energy source such as ATP. Archaeosine (7-formamidino-7-deazaguanosine; Figure 1(a)) is the only other hypermodified nucleoside with a 7-deazaguanine framework. Most archaeal tRNAs have archaeosine at position 15 in the D loop,19 a position that is not modified in the tRNAs from the other two primary phylogenetic domains.20 Archaeosine was discovered first in the tRNAs from Thermoplasma acidophilum, and has now been found in many archaeal species.21 The chemical structure of archaeosine was determined to be 7-formamidino-7-deazaguanosine by Gregson et al.19 (Figure 1(a)), who proposed that archaeosine functions in the stabilization of the tRNA structure. The biosynthetic pathway of archaeosine is closely related to that of queuosine. The archaeosine TGT (ArcTGT) replaces the guanine base at position 15 of the archaeal tRNAs with the free precursor, 7-cyano-7deazaguanine (preQ0), and then the incorporated preQ0 is further modified into archaeosine on the tRNA22 (Figure 1(a)). The crystal structure of a bacterial QueTGT from Zymomonas mobilis has been solved.23 It suggested that the base-exchange reaction proceeds via two consecutive nucleophilic substitutions involving an aspartate residue and that, in the process, a QueTGT·tRNA covalent intermediate is formed.23,24 The N-terminal region of ArcTGT shows sequence homology to the full-length QueTGT, and the putative catalytic aspartate residue is strictly conserved. Therefore, both TGTs are considered to catalyze the base-exchange reaction by quite similar mechanisms (Figure 1(b)). On the other hand, the substrate specificity of ArcTGT is different from that of QueTGT. As substrates, the ArcTGT utilizes only the preQ0 and guanine bases,22 whereas the bacterial QueTGT utilizes the preQ1, preQ0, and guanine bases.13,14 Compared to QueTGT, ArcTGT has an extra C-terminal region composed of about 300 amino acid residues, which shows no sequence similarity with any other protein with known structure. This structural difference is likely to be related to the difference in tRNA recognition between ArcTGT and QueTGT: ArcTGT modifies position 15 in the D-loop of tRNA, while QueTGT recognizes the tRNA anticodon stem-loop and modifies position 34 of the tRNA anticodon loop.25,26 The C-terminal region of ArcTGT has partial sequence homology to a putative RNA-binding domain, the "PUA domain".27 By a sequence profile analysis, the PUA domain was identified in a variety of RNAmodifying enzymes, such as the CBF5-like pseudouridine synthases, and therefore was proposed to bind RNA.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination The crystal structure of P. horikoshii ArcTGT (Mr of 66,000) was determined by the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method, using a crystal of the selenomethionine derivative (Table 1). The final model has an R-factor of 22.7% (free R-factor of 26.1%) against the diffraction data ° of the native crystal up to 2.2 A resolution (Table 2). The crystal structure of ArcTGT contains two

molecules per asymmetric unit, and each molecule is bound with one zinc ion and a putative magnesium ion (Figure 2). The ArcTGT structure consists of the N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 6­ 360) and the C-terminal region with unidentified functions (residues 361­ 582) (Figure 3). The C-terminal region is divided into three domains, C1, C2, and C3 (Figure 3). Six residues at the N terminus and ten residues (97 ­ 106) near the catalytic site are disordered (see Figure 6(a)).

Dimer structure In the homodimeric structure, the two subunits interact closely through the zinc-binding site, with a CXCX2CX22H motif, and a part of the C-terminal domains (Figure 2). The intersubunit contact area

formation. Therefore, the a2 dimer is likely to be the functional form of ArcTGT. On the other hand, the Z. mobilis QueTGT does not form a dimer,28 while the Escherichia coli QueTGT seems to oligomerize in solution.29 The putative dimerization manner of the E. coli QueTGT was proposed from the symmetry-related interaction of the Z. mobilis QueTGT in the crystal.23 The dimerization manner of ArcTGT, because it involves the ArcTGT specific C-terminal domains (Figure 2), is fundamentally different from that of the E. coli QueTGT.

Catalytic domain The major part of the N-terminal domain of ArcTGT is an (a/b)8 barrel with the top end open and with the bottom end closed by the N-terminal three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (Figure 3(a)). The conserved Asp95, a putative catalytic residue, is located on the inner side of the open end of the barrel (Figure 5(a)). The zinc-binding site is inserted near the C terminus of the barrel (Figures 2 and 3). These structural features are quite similar to those of the full-length Z. mobilis QueTGT,23 as expected from the considerable sequence homology of the P. horikoshii ArcTGT domain to the Z. mobilis QueTGT (26% sequence identity over 356 residues) (Figure 4). The electrostatic surface potential and the solvent-accessible surface of the entire dimeric ArcTGT were calculated, as shown in Figure 5(b). The charge distribution of the catalytic domain of ArcTGT is considerably different from that of QueTGT (Figure 5(b) and (c)). In particular, the positively charged patch near the zinc-binding site of ArcTGT is narrower than that of QueTGT. The basic patch of Z. mobilis QueTGT contains Arg286 and Arg289, which are conserved only among QueTGTs and not conserved in ArcTGTs.30 It has been proposed that the basic patch and these arginine residues of QueTGT recognize the anticodon stem of the tRNA.23,30 Therefore, these electrostatic surface properties may reflect the difference in the base-exchange site in the tRNA between ArcTGT and QueTGT (positions 15 and 34, respectively). Moreover, there are several structural differences between the catalytic domains of ArcTGT and the full-length QueTGT. First, QueTGT has an antiparallel b-sheet, which is inserted between the helices that correspond to helices a5 and a6 in ArcTGT (Figures 4(a) and 7). Second, ArcTGT has helix a9, which is not present in QueTGT, near the catalytic pocket (Figures 4(a) and 7). Third, ArcTGT has additional helices, a16 and a17, at the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain (Figures 3 and 4(b)). These additional helices may enable the catalytic domain to connect properly with the ArcTGT-specific C-terminal domains.

° is about 2200 A2. Correspondingly, the molecular mass of ArcTGT in solution was estimated by dynamic light-scattering experiments to be about 124 kDa (Rh ¼ 4.67 nm) at 20 8C and 131 kDa (Rh ¼ 4.77 nm) at 60 8C, which supports the dimer

(b) Topology diagram of the ArcTGT structure. a-Helices are represented with circles or tubes, and b-strands are shown with rectangles or arrows.

C-terminal domains The C-terminal domains, C1, C2, and C3, of ArcTGT have no sequence similarity to any other protein with known structure. Domain C1 (residues 361­ 431) is composed of loops and four b-strands (Figure 3). Some ArcTGTs have long insertions at the end of this domain (Figure 4). Domain C1 is involved in the dimerization, as described above (Figure 2(b)). Domain C2 (residues 432 ­503) is formed by a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet lined with two a-helices (Figure 3). Domain C3 encompasses residues 504 ­582 and is highly conserved among all ArcTGTs. This domain has sequence homology to the "PUA domain", which was detected by a sequence profile analysis and was predicted to be rich in b-strands.27 The PUA domain sequence is present in the eukaryotic CBF5 C synthases and some putative RNA-modifying enzymes from eukaryotes and archaea.27 In the present crystal structure, domain C3 consists of two a-helices and six b-strands, and folds into a b-sandwich structure (Figure 3). The spatial arrangement of these secondary structure elements within domain C3 is similar to the oligonucleotide-binding (OB)-fold,31 whereas their arrangement in the sequence is completely different. Furthermore, domain C3 is bound

with a putative magnesium ion, which is coordinated octahedrally by main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms (Ala528, Val531, Met566, Ile567, and Phe569) and one water molecule (Figures 2(a) and 4(b)). In ArcTGT, domains C2 and C3 have conserved basic residues (Arg470, Arg483, Arg522, Lys576, Arg578, and Lys579) on the surfaces of their b-sheets (Figure 4(b)). Intriguingly, the catalytic domain has conserved basic residues (Lys13, Arg15, and Lys20) on the outer surface of the N-terminal three-stranded b-sheet, which closes the barrel (Figure 3(b)). These basic residues of the three domains form a continuous, positively charged patch (Figure 5(b)), to which tRNA may bind. Three of the basic residues are conserved in the PUA domains of eukaryotic CBF5 C synthases (Figure 4(b)), which are considered to modify rRNA and snRNAs.32 Within the protein globule of one subunit, the positively charged patch is located on the side opposite to the catalytic site at the open end of the barrel (Figure 3(a)). On the other hand, in the homodimeric structure, the putative tRNA-binding surface of one subunit is on the same side as the catalytic site of the other subunit (Figure 5(a) and (b)). Therefore, it is possible that the C-terminal domains of one subunit recognize the tRNA, and the catalytic site of

the other subunit catalyzes the base-exchange reaction. Base-bound structures In the free form of ArcTGT, residues 97 ­106 near the catalytic site are completely disordered (Figure 6(a)), and the catalytic site is exposed to the solvent. Before and after the base-exchange reaction, the conformational flexibility of the disordered region may facilitate the diffusion of the nucleotide at position 15 of tRNA into/out of the catalytic pocket. Therefore, we soaked the native

crystals in mother liquor containing guanine or preQ0, and determined the complex structures at ° ° 2.3 A and 2.5 A resolution, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). In the guanine-bound form, the disordered residues are partially ordered and fold into an a-helix (helix a5), and the electron density corresponding to the guanine base is evident (Figure 6(b)). The side-chain of Ser98 and the backbones of Ser98 and Phe99 anchor the guanine base tightly. The electron density of the Phe99 side-chain is partially observed, as the Cd1 and C11 atoms of Phe99 are ° close to the C8 atom of the guanine base (, 3.8 A).

Color codes for atomic ° B-factors: blue, below 20 A2, and ° yellow, above 100 A2. Other color codes correspond to values between ° 20 and 100 A2. The disordered residues are transparent. The 2Fo 2 Fc omit electron density maps contoured at 1.1s is displayed in dark green for the residues 94 ­ 110 and the substrates.

The Ser98 residue is ordered and makes hydrogen bonds with Ser96. Nevertheless, the other sidechains of helix a5 are disordered completely (Figure 6(b)). The guanine-bound form may be relevant to the first nucleophilic substitution step of the base-exchange reaction: G15 is bound to the catalytic pocket, the C10 atom of G15 is attacked by Asp95, and a covalent bond is formed between the tRNA and the enzyme (Figure 1(b)). The ordered part of helix a5 may block the solvent from entering the catalytic pocket and facilitate the nucleophilic substitution.

In the preQ0-bound form, the electron density of preQ0 is observed at the same position as the guanine base, in the guanine-bound form; the adjacent structure, however, is more ordered and residues 97 ­106, including helix a5, are observed clearly (Figures 6(c) and 7(a)). The side-chain of ° Met102 is ordered because of the contact at 3.8 A between the d sulfur atom of Met102 and the cyano-group nitrogen atom of preQ0 (Figure 6(c)). The preQ0-bound form may be relevant to the second nucleophilic substitution step of the baseexchange reaction: the free preQ0 base is caught

Base recognition mechanism In the complexes with guanine and preQ0, as shown in Figure 8(a) and (b), the Od1 and Od2 atoms of Asp130, at the edge of strand b7, make hydrogen bonds with the N1 and N2 atoms of the base, and the N12 atom of Gln169, at the edge of strand b8, makes a hydrogen bond with the O6 atom. The a-NH group of Gly196 makes a hydrogen bond with the O6 atom of the base, which is involved in the long hydrogen bond network composed of the O6 atom of the base, the a-NH group of Gly196, the a-CO group of Gly195, and the Nh1 and Nh2 atoms of Arg177. The Asp130, Gln169, and Arg177 residues are strictly conserved in the primary structure (Figure 4(a)), and in the tertiary structures of ArcTGT and QueTGT (Figure 8). Furthermore, the substrate base stacks with the aromatic ring of Phe229 (Figure 8(a)), and the fivemembered ring of the base makes van der Waals interactions with Phe99 (Figure 6(b) and (c)). Therefore, in both TGTs, the conserved hydrogen bonds described above are buried in this hydrophobic environment, which facilitate the specific recognition of the common structure of the guanine base and the 7-deazaguanine derivative to distinguish them from other bases. In the guanine-bound form of ArcTGT, the N7 atom of guanine makes hydrogen bonds with a well-ordered water molecule, which in turn hydrogen bonds with the a-NH group of Val198 (Figure 8(a)). On the other hand, in the preQ0-bound form, the exocyclic cyano moiety of preQ0 replaces the well-ordered water molecule observed in the guanine-bound form, and hydrogen bonds with the a-NH group of Val198 (Figure 8(b)). Moreover, the p-electron-bearing cyano moiety makes van der Waals interactions with the side-chains of Phe99 and Met102, as described above (Figure 6). In the preQ1-bound form of QueTGT,23 the sidechain of Ala232, which corresponds to Val198 in ArcTGT (Figure 4(a)), faces away from the catalytic pocket. Moreover, the a-CO group of the adjoining Leu231 residue faces the 7-substituent group side, and hydrogen bonds with the exocyclic aminomethyl moiety of preQ1 (Figure 8(c) and (d)). In striking contrast, in the preQ0-bound form of ArcTGT, the side-chain of Val198 faces the catalytic pocket, and the a-NH group faces the 7-substituent group side (Figure 8(a), (b), and (d)). These structural differences can be ascribed to the inserted helix a9, which does not exist in QueTGT (Figures 4(a) and 7). Therefore, the substrate pocket of ArcTGT cannot bind a bulky and positively charged 7-substituent group, such as the aminomethyl moiety of preQ1 and the formamidino moiety of the archaeosine base (Figure 1(a)). These observations coincide with the fact that ArcTGT utilizes the preQ0 and guanine bases as substrates, but not the preQ1 and archaeosine bases.22 In QueTGT, the Ser residue corresponding to Ser96 was proposed to play an important role in the substrate orientation.33 In contrast, in ArcTGT,

Figure 7. The catalytic domain of the preQ0-bound form of (a) ArcTGT and (b) the base-free form of QueTGT. The viewpoints of (a) and (b) are adjusted to that of Figure 6. The color of helix a5 corresponds to the atomic B-factors, as indicated below. The arrows indicate the major structural differences between the ArcTGT and QueTGT, which are discussed in the text.

within the catalytic pocket, N9 of preQ0 attacks the ribose C10 at position 15 of the tRNA, and the N-glycosidic bond between the base and ribose moieties of the tRNA is regenerated (Figure 1(b)). The induced-fit of helix a5 may also facilitate the nucleophilic substitution, as in the guanine-bound form. Even in the base-free structure of QueTGT,23 the a-helix corresponding to helix a5 was observed with high B-factors (Figure 7). In the crystals of QueTGT,23 the a helix interacts with the other symmetric molecule through the QueTGT-specific antiparallel b-sheet (Figures 4(a) and 7).

The base substrates are indicated as ball-and-stick models. Hydrogen bonds are shown by colored broken lines. (d) Superposition of the active sites of the ArcTGT and QueTGT (stereo view). Residues of ArcTGT and QueTGT involved in the base recognition are shown by stick models, in ivory and cyan, respectively. The arrows indicate the major structural differences between the ArcTGT and QueTGT active site, which are discussed in the text.

° Ser96 is located 4.0 A away from the N2 atom of preQ0 (Figure 6(b) and (c)). Therefore, Ser96 cannot make a direct hydrogen bond with the N2 atom of preQ0. To investigate the role of the Ser96 residue

in ArcTGT, we mutated Ser96 to Ala (S96A), and measured the enzymatic activity. The Vmax/Km value of the S96A mutant is reduced by about 20-fold as compared with the wild-type enzyme,

° tions of the native dataset from 50.0 to 2.2 A. The coordinates of the disordered residues 97 ­ 106 are taken from the preQ0-bound form structure (described below), and are included in the final refinement procedure. The Ramachandran plot analysis with the program PROCHECK44 showed that 90.8% of the residues in the final structure are in the most favored and additionally allowed regions. Determination of the complex structures Native ArcTGT crystals were soaked for three days in a preQ0 or guanine-containing cryo-protectant buffer composed of 140 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing 670 mM NaH2PO4, 670 mM KH2PO4, 1180 mM CH3COONa, and 15% (v/v) glycerol. A dataset was collected under cryogenic conditions at station BL45PX at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) using an RAXIS-V imaging plate detector (RIGAKU). Using the native crystal structure as a search model, molecular replacement was performed by AMoRe.45 The solution was further refined with the program CNS, by energy minimization and simulated annealing procedures. Dynamic light-scattering Dynamic light-scattering was performed on a DynaPro MS dynamic light-scattering instrument (Protein Solutions) using the program DYNAMICS from Protein Solutions. Samples were prepared using the same protocol as for the crystallized samples, and were dissolved in 10 mM Tris ­ HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Zn(CH3COO)2, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 410 mM NaCl, to a concentration of 2.0 mg/ml. Prior to the measurement, the samples were filtered through a 0.1 mm Anodisc13 glass filter (Whatman). Mutational analyses Each of the mutations (D95A and S96A) was introduced into the Phtgt/pET3a vector,46 using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The resultant expression vectors were transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3)-tRNARI strain, which carries the tRNA genes for Arg and Ile minor codons (AGR and AUA, respectively). These transformants were cultivated at 37 8C in LB medium (1% (w/v) Tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, and 0.5% (v/v) yeast extract) containing 25 mg/ml of ampicillin and 33 mg/ml of chloramphenicol. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-b-D -galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.1 mM) at A600 , 0.5 for three hours, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Approximately 7 g of cells were obtained from 2.5 liters of culture. A cell-free extract was prepared by sonication of the cell pellet in 50 volumes of sonication buffer (50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 50 mg/ml of DNase I). The crude extract was heated at 85 8C for 30 minutes and was examined by SDS-PAGE. The in vitro transcript of tRNAVal from P. horikoshii was prepared as described.46 The enzymatic activities of the mutant and wild-type enzymes were assayed as described.46 Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates of free, guanine-bound, and preQ0bound form of ArcTGT have been deposited in the

whereas in the corresponding mutant of the E. coli QueTGT, the activity is reduced by about 11,000fold.34 This result supports the idea that the Ser96 residue of ArcTGT is not involved in the base recognition directly. On the other hand, Ser96 hydrogen bonds with the Og atom of Ser98 on helix a5, which is structurally ordered upon binding to the base substrate, as described above, and provides Phe99 and Met102 for the base recognition (Figure 6). Therefore, these observations may correlate with the 20-fold decrease in the activity of the S96A mutant. Finally, the Od1 atom of Asp95 makes a direct hydrogen bond with the N2 atom of the base substrate (Figure 8(a) and (b)). The Od2 atom of Asp95 ° is located within 3 A of the supposed position of the anomeric C10 atom of G15 (data not shown), which is in good agreement with the hypothesis that the nucleophilic aspartate residue attacks C10 of the ribose moiety from the a-face.24 To verify the role of Asp95 in ArcTGT, we constructed the Asp95 to Ala mutant (D95A). In the case of the Z. mobilis QueTGT, the corresponding D102A mutation eliminated the enzymatic activity.24 Similarly, the D95A mutation in ArcTGT abolished the enzymatic activity. A detailed analysis of the role of Asp95 must await the determination of the ArcTGT·tRNA complex structure.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and data collection Recombinant P. horikoshii ArcTGT was over-expressed in E. coli, purified, and crystallized. The selenomethionine-labeled ArcTGT was prepared and crystallized. The experimental details are described elsewhere.35 The datasets of the native crystal and the selenomethionine derivative were collected at stations BL44XU and BL41XU at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan), respectively. The native crystal belongs to the tetragonal space group ° P43212, with unit-cell parameters a ¼ b ¼ 99.28 A, ° c ¼ 363.74 A, and the selenomethionine-labeled crystal belongs to the same space group, with unit-cell para° ° meters a ¼ b ¼ 100.15 A, c ¼ 363.64 A. The data were processed and scaled with the program HKL2000.36 Structure determination and refinement The scaled dataset at the peak wavelength of the MAD ° experiment up to 3.2 A was used to calculate the normalized structure factor with the program DREAR,37 and the resulting data were input into the program SnB37 to locate the selenium atoms. After several trials of SnB, 22 consistent peaks were picked out of the 32 atoms expected in the asymmetric unit, and were input into the program SHARP38 to calculate the initial phases and the heavy-atom refinement. The resulting initial phases were refined with density modification using the program SOLOMON.39 The non-crystallographic averaging ° with phase extension up to 2.8 A was performed with DM.40 The model was built using the program O,41 and was refined by energy minimization and simulated annealing procedures with the program CNS42,43 using the reflec-
