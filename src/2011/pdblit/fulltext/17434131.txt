The Transcriptional Regulator RfaH Stimulates RNA Chain Synthesis after Recruitment to Elongation Complexes by the Exposed Nontemplate DNA Strand
Irina Artsimovitch2 and Robert Landick1 Department of Bacteriology University of Wisconsin--Madison 1550 Linden Drive Madison, Wisconsin 53706 cessory molecules that lack intrinsic activity but help other regulators bind TECs (e.g., NusB and NusE; Mason et al., 1992), to enhancers or inhibitors of pausing and termination (e.g., NusA and NusG; Burns et al., 1998), to strong antiterminators (e.g., phage N and Q; Rees et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 1998). Recruitment and action of antitermination proteins are best understood in bacteriophage . Here, two proteins, N and Q, control phage early and late gene expression, respectively. N or Q can change the state of transcribing RNAP to one that resists both pausing and termination, in part by increasing the rate of transcription and additionally by stabilizing the TEC against dissociation (Rees et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 1998). This modification persists through tens of kb and requires recruitment of N or Q to the TEC, which is accomplished differently for the two proteins. N is recruited through interaction with a nascent RNA structure and combines with other cellular factors (NusA, B, E, and G) to form a multicomponent complex. In contrast, Q binds to a DNA site just upstream of the promoter, loads onto the TEC at a promoter-proximal pause site, and requires only NusA for antitermination. Interaction of the 70 initiation factor with a 10 promoter-element-like sequence on the nontemplate DNA strand causes the pause and is required for Q function (Ring et al., 1996). However, the mechanisms of putative cellular antiterminators like RfaH and ribosomal protein S4 (with which other proteins suppress -dependent termination in ribosomal operons in a mechanism similar to RfaH's; Torres et al., 2001) have not been elucidated. RfaH is required for expression of certain extracytoplasmic macromolecules, notably pathogenicity factors like hemolysin (Bailey et al., 1997; Leeds and Welch, 1996, 1997). RfaH was discovered genetically in S. typhimurium and E. coli, where it is required for lipopolysaccharide synthesis (Wilkinson et al., 1972) and for expression of the F plasmid tra operon (Beutin and Achtman, 1979), respectively. Subsequent work established that RfaH (1) is also required for expression of hly (Koronakis et al., 1988), kps (Stevens et al., 1997), rfb (Wang et al., 1998), and chu (Nagy et al., 2001) genes; (2) requires for its effect a short consensus sequence called ops (operon polarity suppressor), typically located within the transcribed but nontranslated regions of operons (Bailey et al., 1997); and (3) is required for increased readthrough of both intrinsic and -dependent termination signals in vivo (Koronakis et al., 1988; Stevens et al., 1997) and for synthesis of longer transcripts in cell extracts (Bailey et al., 2000). These results have led to the hypothesis that RfaH is an antiterminator or elongation enhancer, perhaps similar to N or Q, that is recruited to the transcription elongation complex (TEC) at the ops site and able to affect transcription up to 20 kb downstream (Figure 1; Leeds and Welch, 1997; Bailey et al., 1997, 2000). However, it is as yet unknown how RfaH is targeted to ops-containing operons and whether it is a primary regulatory protein like N and Q or an accessory factor like NusB or NusE that is required for activity of an

Summary The transcriptional regulatory protein RfaH controls expression of several operons that encode extracytoplasmic components in bacteria. Regulation by RfaH occurs during transcript elongation and depends on a 5 -proximal, transcribed nucleic acid sequence called ops that induces transcriptional pausing in vitro and in vivo. We report that RfaH recognizes RNA polymerase transcribing RfaH-regulated operons by interacting with the ops sequence in the exposed nontemplate DNA strand of ops-paused transcription complexes. Although RfaH delays escape from the ops pause, once escape occurs, RfaH enhances elongation by suppressing pausing and -dependent termination without apparent involvement of other accessory proteins. This activity predicts a cumulative antitermination model for RfaH's regulation of ops-containing operons in vivo. Introduction Antitermination, sometimes called elongation enhancement, upregulates gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes by causing RNA polymerase (RNAP) to transcribe efficiently through sites of termination (dissociation of transcribing RNAP from DNA and RNA) and pausing (temporary cessation of the 10­100 nt/s rate of nt addition by RNAP) (Conaway and Conaway, 1999; Greenblatt et al., 1993; Weisberg and Gottesman, 1999). In eukaryotes, termination is poorly understood, but there is a near universal requirement for association of regulatory proteins with RNAPII to allow completion of mRNA synthesis (Bentley, 1995). In prokaryotes, termination can be caused by extrinsic termination factors like or by intrinsic signals in the DNA and RNA (e.g., DNA encoding a GC-rich RNA hairpin followed by 3­8 Us; Richardson and Greenblatt, 1996). Pausing, which is an initial step in both types of termination, can facilitate recruitment of regulators to the transcription elongation complex (TEC) and limits the overall rate of transcription. Pausing is caused by sequence-induced conformational changes in the TEC that disrupt the reactive alignment of nucleotides in RNAP's active site (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000; Palangat and Landick, 2001; Toulokhonov et al., 2001). Many bacterial regulatory proteins (and RNAs) modulate termination and pausing in different combinations and to varying extents, ranging from acCorrespondence: landick@bact.wisc.edu Present address: Department of Microbiology, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.

Figure 1. Model of RfaH Action Pausing of RNAP (blue) at the ops site (green) allows recruitment of RfaH (orange) to the TEC. Once bound, RfaH modifies the TEC to a termination-resistant state. Modified RNAP bypasses termination signals and completes transcription of the distal genes. In the absence of RfaH, the transcript is released at terminator downstream of the ops site.

unknown principal antiterminator. RfaH could bind the TEC like N via interactions with the nascent RNA; however, neither DNA nor RNA binding by RfaH has been detected in vitro (Bailey et al., 1996). Like Q, recruitment of RfaH could be aided by transcriptional pausing; pausing of RNAP at ops has been detected both in vivo (Leeds and Welch, 1997) and in vitro (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000). To dissect RfaH's mechanisms of TEC binding and stimulation of transcript elongation, we studied the activity of purified RfaH using in vitro transcription and interaction assays. Results RfaH Accelerates Transcript Elongation and Inhibits Termination after Direct Recruitment to the TEC by ops To investigate the mechanism of RfaH action, we asked if purified RfaH could affect transcription by purified RNAP of a linear DNA template containing the rfaQ ops site 33 bp after a T7 A1 promoter transcription start site and 100 bp before the well characterized his leader pause site (Phis). We compared transcription of a template that contained the wild-type rfaQ ops site to one containing a scrambled ops sequence that no longer should recruit RfaH, but still caused RNAP to pause (Figures 2A and 2B). After halting transcription complexes at G37 by withholding UTP, we examined transcription of the remainder of the templates by separating on denaturing gels RNA samples that were collected at time intervals after addition of UTP (to restart the halted complexes) and at limiting GTP (to facilitate measurement of pausing). We compared the reaction profiles of different RNA species to the predictions of kinetic models that describe the behavior of RNAP (Frieden, 1994; Landick et al., 1996). For two pause positions within ops, U43 and C45, as well as two downstream pause sites, P1 and Phis, we obtained empirical rate constants for RNAP bypass of the site without pausing (kn; n denotes the pause position), for isomerization into the paused state (kin), and for escape from the pause (ken; unique values for kn and kin cannot always be estimated, so we instead report a ratio, E, equivalent to the fraction of RNAPs that pause) (Figure 2E). Separately, we estimated an average rate constant for addition of each nt between C45 and the template end (kave for 179 positions, including pause sites like P1 and Phis). These empirical kinetic parameters accurately predict transcript elongation by RNAP (Figures 2C and 2D).

Without RfaH, RNAP paused within ops most strongly at U43 (Figures 2A and 2E). Addition of RfaH (to 40 nM; equimolar to TECs) decreased pausing at U43, but significantly delayed escape of the RNAP molecules that paused at C45 ( 1/2 of all RNAPs; ke decreased by a factor of 20). However, once RNAP escaped from the ops site, RfaH increased the average elongation rate almost 3-fold (kave; Figure 2E). Kinetic simulations revealed that all RNAP molecules were accelerated, not just the fraction that were delayed at the C45 site (data not shown); thus, enhanced pausing of some RNAPs at C45 must be a consequence of, rather than a requirement for, RfaH action. Despite increased pausing at C45, RfaH-enhancement of transcription is also evident in earlier arrival of RNAP at the end of the template (compare the times at which 10% of the RNAPs form run-off RNA in Figures 2C and 2D; 62 s without RfaH and 28 s with RfaH). The effect of RfaH is clearly evident at pause sites like P1 and Phis, where RfaH increased RNAP's rate of escape by greater than 3-fold, but had a lesser effect on the efficiency of pausing (only Phis results are shown; the effect of RfaH at P1 was similar). RfaH caused similar effects on other ops-containing templates (data not shown), suggesting that the function of ops is largely independent of flanking sequences. Importantly, 40 nM RfaH had no effect on transcription of the scrambled ops template (Figures 2B and 2E); however, consistent with the report of Bailey et al. (1996), RfaH at 2 M accelerated transcription independently of the presence of an ops site (data not shown). Because pausing is thought to be a prerequisite for both -dependent and intrinsic termination (Gusarov and Nudler, 1999; Jin et al., 1992; McDowell et al., 1994), inhibition of pausing by RfaH alone could cause antitermination. To determine whether RfaH could counteract -dependent termination in vitro, we constructed a template that carries the rfaQ ops site followed by the tR1 region, which includes three major -dependent release sites (sites I­III, Figure 3; Lau et al., 1983). In the absence of , the majority of RNAPs (76%) reached the end of the template (RO) and addition of RfaH had little effect except to increase synthesis of a longer RNA product (arrow) that arises from template switching (Denisova et al., 1982). This suggests that RfaH either stabilizes the TEC at the template end or accelerates the rate at which it transcribes onto a new DNA template. In the presence of , transcription terminated at sites I and II; only 23% of TECs transcribed past site II; and only 0.5% run-off transcript was formed. RfaH increased the fraction of RNAP molecules that transcribed past site II to

45% and allowed 4% of the TECs to reach the end of the template (Figure 3, left). Since this RfaH antitermination activity was weaker than reported for N or Q (e.g., see Figure 4 of Mason et al., 1992) and was unaffected by addition of NusA and NusG (data not shown), we tested whether additional

cellular proteins are required for efficient RfaH antitermination. We performed assays in the presence of an S30 cell extract prepared from a rfaH strain (Figure 3, right). The extract contained (so added had little effect), as well as extract proteins (likely NusA and NusG) that focus termination to site II. However, RfaH still increased

Cell 196

RfaH does not strongly antiterminate transcription even in the presence of cell extract. Although our rfaH cell extract conceivably lacked factors (e.g., proteins that require RfaH for expression or small regulatory molecules) that could enhance antitermination in vivo (Bailey et al., 2000), will act less aggressively in vivo than in our experiment because in vivo mRNAs are protected by ribosomes; thus the effects seen in Figure 3 may well be sufficient to produce large effects in vivo. Taken together, our results argue that RfaH enhances long transcript synthesis in vivo by cumulative modest antitermination at successive sites (see Discussion). RfaH Binds to the TEC through ops in the Nontemplate DNA RfaH's ability to enhance pausing specifically at the ops site (Figure 2A) raises an interesting question: how can RfaH recognize ops given that, in the paused TEC, the ops sequence both in the RNA and template DNA strand is protected within RNAP's nucleic acid binding channels (Korzheva et al., 2000; Figure 4A)? We considered the possibility that RfaH recognizes ops in the nontemplate DNA, which is partially accessible to nuclease in a TEC (Wang and Landick, 1997) and is able to interact with in initiating transcription complexes at the promoter-proximal, Q-recruitment pause site (Ring et al., 1996). To determine which nucleic acid strand(s) RfaH recognizes in the ops-paused transcription complex, we reconstituted active TECs from short RNA and DNA oligonucleotides that carried either the ops element or an unrelated, mutant sequence and then assayed RfaH binding by gel mobility shift assay (Figure 4B). Because addition of RfaH to the TEC did not detectably change its electrophoretic mobility, we 32P-labeled RfaH on a heart muscle kinase tag fused to its N terminus and assayed [32P]RfaH binding to unlabeled TECs. We first determined the mobility of the heteroduplex DNA and of TECs in the absence of RfaH using 32P-labeled DNA (Figure 4B, lanes 1 and 2). We then compared these mobilities to that of unlabeled TECs to which equimolar, labeled RfaH was added. RfaH alone (lane 3) did not form a distinct band in a gel. Labeled RfaH colocalized only with TECs that contained ops on the nontemplate DNA strand (lanes 4 and 5). RfaH did not bind to TECs that contained a mutant nontemplate DNA strand (lane 7) or to the DNA heteroduplex alone (lane 8). RfaH bound only weakly to binary (DNA:RNAP) complexes (lane 6); however, if RNAP binds DNA duplex without strand preference, only half of those complexes contained ops on the nontemplate strand. We conclude that RfaH binds specifically to TECs at the ops site by recognizing the nontemplate DNA strand within the melted transcription bubble. RfaH appears to bind TEC with 1:1 stoichiometry: equimolar RfaH and TECs gave near 100% modification of TECs (Figure 2). To ask if this sequence specificity reflects direct binding of RfaH to the nontemplate strand or an ops-mediated conformational change in TECs that contacts RfaH elsewhere, we UV irradiated TECs that contained 32P in one of the nucleic acid strands in the presence and in the absence of RfaH (Figure 4C). RfaH crosslinked to the nontemplate strand when it contained an ops site,

The linear DNA template contained the PR promoter followed by the ops signal and the tR1 -dependent termination region, which consists of three major release positions (I­III). The transcription start site, positions of the pause sites, and the run-off transcript (RO) are indicated by arrows. Preformed [ -32P]GMP-labeled A26 complexes were incubated with 20 M NTPs for 15 min at 37 C. In the left panel, only purified proteins were used; in the right panel, S30 E. coli extract from a strain lacking RfaH was added to A26 TEC one minute prior to the NTP addition. Purified and RfaH were added where indicated; extract also contains endogenous . Positions of run-off (RO) transcript and termination sites are indicated. Marker positions are indicated on the right. Numbers listed below each lane are the percentages of transcribing RNAPs that readthrough (RT) sites I­III individually, the cumulative percentages (*, in italics) that readthrough site II or the tR1 terminator, and the percentage of RNAPs that reach the end of the template (%RO*).

readthrough past site II about 2-fold (from 27% to 52%), and increased the full-length RNA from 0.7% to 3%. This effect is similar to the 2-fold enhancement by opsRfaH of transcription in vivo through a kps terminator (Stevens et al., 1997). In contrast to N (Rees et al., 1997), but similarly to S4 antiterminator protein (Torres et al., 2001), RfaH had little effect at several -independent terminators tested. However, RfaH increased readthrough 2-fold at the intrinsic terminator from the hlyAB intergenic region (data not shown), a terminator at which an RfaH effect has been reported in vivo (Koronakis et al., 1988). We conclude that RfaH is directly recruited to the TEC by ops after which it strongly and processively stimulates transcript elongation by RNAP at least 150 bp downstream from the ops site and in the absence of other regulatory proteins, establishing that it is a primary transcription regulator with intrinsic activity. However,

but not when ops was absent, and did not crosslink to either the template strand or the RNA transcript. Interestingly, RfaH significantly enhanced an otherwise weak crosslink of the nontemplate DNA to either the or subunit of RNAP. and , which comigrated in this

experiment, are the two large subunits of RNAP that form the active-site channel and make RNA and DNA contacts in the TEC (Figure 4D). To distinguish enhanced crosslinking to versus , we used a variant of RNAP (ProA RNAP, lanes 10 and 11) with a 234 amino acid

RNAP was passed through the RfaH-containing matrix (lane 4), but not by the MPB-containing matrix (lane 7) or by chitin matrix lacking immobilized protein (lane 10). Washing the column with 0.5 M NaCl released RNAP. Further, binding was not detected when equimolar CPB-RfaH and RNAP were preincubated in solution and passed through a chitin column together (data not shown). We conclude that RfaH binds RNAP directly, but that its affinity is relatively weak and detectable only when excess RfaH is immobilized to limit diffusion and present multiple binding targets for retention. In the TEC, RfaH-RNAP interaction could be stabilized by an altered RNAP conformation or, at least transiently, by additional contacts to the nontemplate DNA. Discussion

Coimmobilization of RNAP with RfaH E. coli cell extract containing additional RNAP (lane 1) was loaded onto chitin columns on which RfaH or maltose binding protein (MBP) fusions to the chitin binding protein (CBP) were immobilized, or onto a control column. Fractions that flowed through (lanes 2, 5, and 8), were washed away (lanes 3, 6, and 9), or were retained on columns (lanes 4, 7, and 10) were analyzed on denaturing gels and stained with GelCode Blue (Pierce).

insertion in the subunit (Opalka et al., 2000). The insertion retarded 's gel mobility, allowing us to identify the subunit as the target for RfaH-enhanced crosslinking; crosslinking to the subunit (lower band in lanes 10 and 11) was not altered in the presence of RfaH. We conclude that RfaH directly recognizes the ops sequence in the nontemplate strand and also induces a conformational change in the TEC that enhances subunit-nontemplate DNA crosslinking. RfaH enhancement of nontemplate strand­ subunit interaction is especially interesting because a recently published model of the TEC (Korzheva et al., 2000) predicts that the ops sequence is located in a groove of the subunit that would channel the nontemplate strand to the outside of the ops-paused TEC (Figure 4D, ops shown in oversized green phosphates). Thus, ops appears to be perfectly positioned to mediate a DNAsequence-specific interaction of RfaH with both the nontemplate DNA and RNAP in the ops-paused TEC. RfaH Binds to RNAP Directly A direct interaction between RfaH and RNAP could explain why RfaH action becomes ops-independent at high concentration (Bailey et al., 1996, and data not shown). Interaction of RfaH and RNAP has been suggested because suppressors of rfaH mutations map near rpoBC (Farewell et al., 1991), although these suppressors could act via known effects of RNAP substitutions on transcript elongation and termination (McDowell et al., 1994). We performed affinity chromatography using RfaH immobilized on chitin-coated beads through a chitin binding domain (CBP) fused to its N terminus to test for a direct interaction between RfaH and RNAP (Figure 5). As a control, we also tested columns containing maltose binding protein (MBP) fused to CBP. Core RNAP was retained when cell extract supplemented with excess

Our results lead to three principal conclusions. First, RfaH is recruited to RNAP at the ops site and delays escape of a fraction of RNAPs from ops. Second, even in the absence of other regulatory proteins, RfaH by itself significantly increases the rate of transcript elongation downstream of ops, where it suppresses pausing and inhibits -dependent and intrinsic termination at a subset of sites. Thus, RfaH is a primary regulator of transcript elongation with an in vitro activity that suggests RfaH regulates gene expression in vivo by cumulative modest antitermination. Third, RfaH interacts with at least two components of the TEC during recruitment: (1) the ops sequence in the nontemplate DNA strand, and (2) the core RNAP. Mechanism of RfaH Recruitment to the TEC RfaH appears to be the prototype of a new class of transcriptional regulator that uses the exposed nontemplate DNA strand to recognize TECs transcribing particular genes or operons. This mode of interaction is similar to the way bacterial factors recognize the " 10" element of promoter DNA in initiation complexes (Roberts and Roberts, 1996), but differs in critically important ways. must be preloaded on RNAP prior to RNAP's interaction with promoter DNA. Although can shift with an initiating RNAP to interact with other 10-like sequences in the early transcribed region, it is unable to bind from solution to transcribing RNAP located at a 10 sequence (Ring et al., 1996; see below). RfaH, in contrast, can bind to fully mature TECs located at ops sequences arbitrarily positioned within a transcription unit (Figure 4B). The fact that RfaH inhibits escape of RNAP paused at the ops site, but then suppresses pausing downstream from the site suggests that RfaH may shift its contacts to the TEC from an initial set that includes specific interactions with the exposed nontemplate bases to a set of strictly protein-protein interactions or sequence-independent nucleic acid interactions that mediate its elongation-enhancing effect. While the base-specific contacts are maintained, closure of the upstream edge of the transcription bubble, which thermodynamically compensates for opening of the bubble's leading edge upon translocation, likely is inhibited. Thus, RfaH-enhanced pausing could serve as a checkpoint to ensure that RfaH establishes functional interactions with RNAP prior to its escape from the ops-induced

pause. Additional examples of this type of regulatory protein may emerge as the full spectrum of elongation control mechanisms in both bacteria and eukaryotes is elucidated. Mechanism of Transcriptional Regulation by RfaH RfaH increases expression of downstream portions of ops-containing operons in vivo and in cell extracts without affecting transcription initiation (Bailey et al., 1997, 2000; Leeds and Welch, 1996), but whether it was a full-fledged antiterminator like N or Q, an elongation enhancer, or an accessory protein had been unclear. We find that RfaH itself significantly enhances transcript elongation, suppresses pausing, and modestly suppresses termination (up to 2-fold), alone or in the presence of cell extract (Figures 2 and 3). RfaH's effects on transcript elongation and pausing are comparable to the effects reported for N or Q ( 3-fold enhancement of overall elongation rate; Rees et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 1998), but its effects on termination are significantly less. RfaH's modest effect on termination may be solely a consequence of decreased pausing, which is an early step in termination (Gusarov and Nudler, 1999; Jin et al., 1992; McDowell et al., 1994). In contrast, the kinetic effects of both N and Q on chain elongation alone cannot account for their strong suppression of termination; both factors additionally stabilize the TEC against dissociation at terminators (Rees et al., 1997; Yarnell and Roberts, 1999). However, the modest antitermination that results from elongation enhancement by RfaH may be sufficient to account for its in vivo effect. The effect of RfaH progressively increases in more promoter-distal segments of long ops-containing operons; for instance, it enhances expression of segments of the hlyABCD operon (encoding hemolysin) negligibly just after ops, and then 2-, 6-, 7-, and 11-fold at increasing distances downstream (Leeds and Welch, 1996). Precisely this type of effect is predicted by the activity of RfaH we observed in vitro. For instance, an increase in readthrough of eight sequential terminators from 50% to 67%, which is similar to

RfaH's effect on site II of tR1 (Figure 3), increases downstream expression 15-fold. This cumulative, modest antitermination produces a low overall efficiency of transcription (overall readthrough increases from 0.3% to 4% in the example given). Reported levels of mRNA in the hly and kps operons appear to be higher than this (Koronakis et al., 1988; Stevens et al., 1997), but could be explained if RfaH-regulated operons contain specialized terminators like the hlyAB intergenic terminator (see Results), that perhaps are especially sensitive to changes in elongation rate and thus more strongly affected by RfaH than terminators at which pausing is less important. A comparison of the RfaH and Q antitermination systems is instructive (Figure 6). We picture three types of modules involved in antitermination/elongation enhancement: NT, a nontemplate strand binding/recruitment module; EH, an elongation enhancement module; and AT, an antitermination module that stabilizes the TEC against dissociation. Both systems are recruited to the TEC through interactions of NT with the exposed nontemplate strand in a paused transcription complex. In the Q system, NT is 70; the interaction must occur just after initiation while 70 is still actively associated with RNAP; and Q must transfer from its DNA binding site adjacent to the promoter to the promoter-proximal paused TEC (Grayhack et al., 1985; Ring et al., 1996). In contrast, NT is part of RfaH and the interaction can occur wherever an ops-paused TEC forms (e.g., RfaH is recruited by an ops site 162 nt after the start site in the hly operon [Leeds and Welch, 1997]). In both cases, a rearrangement of contacts occurs at or upon escape from the pause/recruitment site that involves breaking the NT module­nontemplate DNA strand interaction and likely the establishment of new protein-protein contacts with RNAP. In the Q case, 70 may be released, and Q must establish tight interaction with RNAP; in the RfaH case, the NT module must remain associated with EH, and EH must establish contacts with RNAP that increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Both Q and RfaH appear to remain processively bound to the TEC after these contacts are established (Bailey et al., 2000; Gray-

Most RfaH homologs were identified by sequence similarity alone; however, two were previously identified as regulators of gene expression (but not as RfaH homologs): TaA is required for production of a polyketide antibiotic in Myxococcus xanthus (Paitan et al., 1999) and AnfA1 is required for pathogenicity in Serratia entomophila (Nunez-Valdez and Mahanty, 1996).

hack et al., 1985). However, Q contains both EH and AT modules that enhance elongation and strongly suppress termination, respectively, whereas RfaH contains only the EH module and thus suppresses termination only to the extent possible by suppressing pausing and accelerating nucleotide addition. It remains to be determined if EH and AT represent one set of Q contacts to the TEC, or two distinct sets of contacts as the fact that RfaH exhibits one activity and not the other suggests. Biological Role and Evolution of RfaH Homologs RfaH appears to be targeted to a limited set of genes in bacteria that are involved in extracytoplasmic function, notably pathogenesis and cell-cell interactions. For instance, mutations in rfaH produce structural alterations in the lipopolysaccharide coat that in turn cause loss of swarming motility, sensitivity to antibiotics (Stocker et al., 1980), inability to colonize hosts (Nesper et al., 2001), and defects in biofilm formation (Danese et al., 2000) or fruiting body development (Guo et al., 1996) in various bacteria. Further, all ops-containing transcriptional units with products of known or readily inferred function encode extracytoplasmic macromolecules. For example, hly encodes hemolysin; kps encodes exopolysaccharide capsule components; rfa and rfb encode outer membrane components; and tra gene products mediate conjugative transfer of F plasmids. Other examples identi-

fied in E. coli K12 by Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000 are given in Figure 7A; additional ops sites occur in E. coli O157:H7 (Perna et al., 2001), some in cryptic prophages that may be involved in pathogenesis. A possible explanation for this extracytoplasmic focus of the RfaH regulon is suggested by the findings that RfaH copurifies with membrane proteins (Bailey et al., 2000) and that another bacterial antiterminator that regulates genes involved in -glucoside metabolism, BglG, localizes TECs to the cytoplasmic membrane (Gorke and Rak, 2001). Perhaps RfaH not only enhances expression of genes in ops-containing operons, but also targets the affected TECs to sites of secretion, thus creating synthesis/secretion "factories" that are specialized for production of molecules such as hemolysin, which must be acetylated and transported by TolC in an hlyCD-dependent process (Stanley et al., 1998). Based on the occurrence of identifiable RfaH homologs, the RfaH-type regulatory mechanism arose by duplication and functional specialization of the gene for a general bacterial elongation factor, nusG, in the lineage Proteobacteria. RfaH is similar in sequence to NusG (Bailey et al., 1996; Figure 7B), which also increases the rate of chain elongation and suppresses pausing, but is not targeted to particular operons (Sullivan and Gottesman, 1992). A sequence comparison of currently available RfaH and NusG homologs revealed no large

regions of sequence divergence that might correspond to an NT or secretory-specific domain in RfaH (Figure 7B). A phylogenetic tree of the NusG superfamily (Figure 7C) confirmed that NusG appeared early in evolution, prior to the separation of eubacterial and archaeal lineages, and showed that recognizable RfaH homologs are restricted to proteobacteria, where they must have arisen to create an additional regulatory level specific for extracytoplasmic synthetic functions. It remains altogether possible that independent evolutionary events may have generated other relatives of NusG that are targeted to specific TECs by nontemplate strand interactions (potential NusG homologs are found even in yeast and humans; Hartzog et al., 1998) and that other examples of this novel mode of transcriptional regulation remain to be uncovered.
Experimental Procedures Sources of Proteins, Oligonucleotides, and Reagents All general reagents were obtained from Sigma; DNA restriction and modification enzymes, from NEB; Taq DNA polymerase, from Gibco BRL; dNTPs, from USB; and NTPs, from Pharmacia. RNAP was purified from E. coli strain MRE600 (Midwest Grain Processing Co.) as described previously (Hager et al., 1990). Chromosomal rfaH was amplified by PCR and cloned between NdeI and HindIII sites of pET28a and pET33b (Novagen); the resulting plasmids, pIA238 and pIA270, encode 20 (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH) or 25 (MGSSH HHHHHSSGLVPRGSRR ASVH) additional amino acids, respectively, at the nonconserved N terminus; the italicized sequence corresponds to the heart muscle kinase recognition site. When expressed in strain BL21 from either plasmid, RfaH was insoluble and constituted 20% of total cell protein. Cells were lysed by sonication in NTA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 5% glycerol), supplemented with 7 M urea (NTAU). After filtration through a 45 M filter (Nalgene), the cleared lysate was loaded on a Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) column. After four consecutive washes with 10 volumes of NTAU buffer containing 0, 1, 10, and 30 mM imidazole (pH 7.9), RfaH was eluted with 150 mM imidazole, dialyzed stepwise against NTA buffer containing 3 M, 1.5 M, 0.75 M urea, and finally into storage buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 0.1 M NaCl, 50% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM DTT). The protein was a generous gift from J. Richardson. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies and Oligos, etc. Templates for In Vitro Transcription Reactions All templates for transcription reactions were generated by PCR amplification. Plasmid pIA349 contains a 37 nt U-less transcribed region, followed by the ops site from rfaQ gene. Our definition of the ops consensus differs from that of Bailey et al. (1996) in that we included the downstream, conserved 2 nt motif (TG) that favors pausing by RNAP, thus extending ops to 12 nt. Plasmid pIA392 is identical to pIA349 except at the five positions in the ops region shown in Figure 2. To construct pIA267, the tR1 region was amplified from the phage DNA, and cloned downstream from the ops site. The relevant features of the transcription templates are indicated in figure legends. Pause Assays Halted TECs were formed at 40 nM in transcription buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM NaCl, 14 mM MgCl2, 14 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM Na2EDTA) with ATP and GTP at 2.5 M, CTP at 1 M, ApU at 150 M, and 20 Ci of [ -32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN) on a linear template for 15 min at 37 C. Elongation was allowed to resume by addition of 10 M GTP, 150 M each ATP, CTP, UTP (Pharmacia), and 50 g rifampicin/ml. Samples were taken at the desired time points and mixed with equal volume of 2 stop solution (Landick et al., 1996). After completion of the time course, samples were incubated for an additional 5 min with 250 M each NTP (chase).

RNA Electrophoresis and Analysis Samples were denatured for 2 min at 90 C and electrophoresed through 9% denaturing gels (19:1 [w/w] acrylamide to bis-acrylamide, 7 M urea) in 1 TBE (44 mM Tris-borate [pH 8.3] and 7.5 mM EDTA). Relative concentrations of RNA species were determined using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software from Molecular Dynamics. Kinetic Modeling Best-fit, empirical rate constants that describe the behavior of RNAP at sequential pause sites (kn, kin, and ken for bypass, isomerization, and escape; Figure 2E; Landick et al., 1996) were obtained using the programs KINSIM and FITSIM (Frieden, 1994), the arrival of RNAPs at each pause predicted by constants determined for upstream sites, and the concentrations of RNA at and beyond the pause. Average rate constants (kave) for positions 46­225 were obtained from a single fit to a sequential mechanism with no distinct pause sites after C45. These empirical rate constants do not necessarily correspond to elementary rate constants in a detailed mechanism of chain elongation, but suffice to accurately predict RNAP's behavior (Figure 2D). -Dependent Termination Assays Halted A26 TECs were formed at 20 nM in transcription buffer II (40mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, and 3% glycerol) with ATP and UTP at 2.5 M, GTP at 1 M, ApU at 150 M, and 20 Ci of [ -32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN) on a linear template from pIA267 for 15 min at 37 C. Elongation was allowed to resume by addition of 20 M each ATP, CTP, UTP, and 50 g rifampicin/ml. For extract assays, S30 E. coli extract prepared as described in (Choy, 1996) from the rfaH strain WAM1925 (Leeds and Welch, 1997) was added to A26 TECs to supply equimolar amounts of RNAP (and corresponding regulatory factors); RNasin (Promega) was added to 2 U per 50 l reaction. When indicated, was added to 10 nM, and RfaH, to 20 nM. Gel Mobility Shift Assays TECs were assembled using either partially or fully complementary DNA oligonucleotides, RNA primer, and core RNAP (Sidorenkov et al., 1998). The wild-type ops (underlined) TEC was assembled from the non-template DNA (NT ops; CACCACCACGCGGGCGGTAGC GTGCTTTTTTCGATCTTCCAGTG), the template DNA (T ops; CACT GGAAGATCG AAAAAAGCACGCTACCGCCCGCGTGGTGGTG), and the 14-mer RNA primer (R ops; GCGGGCGGUAGCGU). To assemble the non-ops complexes, oligonucleotides lacking the ops consensus (lower case) in one of the nucleic acid strands were used (NTM ops, CACCACCACGCGccgccaaggctgCTTTTTTCGATCTTCCAGTG; TM ops, CACTGGAAGATCGAAAAAAGcagatggctgtaCGCGTGGTG GTG, and R14, uuuuuaCAGCCAUC). The template strand and RNA primer at 5 M each were annealed in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 20 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, mixed with core RNAP (at 100 nM) and incubated in the transcription buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 20 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, and 50 g/ml BSA) for 10 min at 22 C. The nontemplate DNA strand oligo was added at 2.5-fold molar excess for 10 min at 37 C. To reconstitute radiolabeled TECs, the nontemplate strand was labeled with [ -32P]ATP (NEN; 6000 Ci/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB). Purified RfaH (500 pmoles) that carried the recognition motif RRASV was labeled at the Ser residue with heart muscle kinase (Sigma) in a 25 l reaction (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]; 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 Ci [ 32P]-ATP [NEN; 6000 Ci/mmol; 20 U of protein kinase]) for 45 min at 22 C. The unincorporated label was removed by gel-filtration through a G50 spin column (Pharmacia), and RfaH was stored at 20 C. Phosphorylation did not affect RfaH activity, as judged by in vitro transcription assay. Reconstituted TECs were mixed with radiolabeled RfaH (at 50 nM each) or storage buffer, incubated for 5 min at 37 C, and loaded onto 3% NuSieve agarose gels in 0.5 TBE. After electrophoresis at room temperature (5V/cm for 4 hr) the gels were exposed to phosphorimager screens. Coimmobilization Assays Total cell extracts expressing RfaH or maltose binding protein fused to the chitin binding protein (NEB) were loaded onto 0.3 ml chitin

beads (NEB) on a disposable column in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, washed with 20 volumes of the same buffer, and then with 20 volumes of binding buffer (BB; 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 8% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM -mercaptoethanol). Purified core RNAP was mixed with E. coli cell extract (as a competitor) and incubated with the protein immobilized on a column for 10 min at room temperature. The column was washed with 20 volumes of BB, and beads were resuspended in the loading SDS buffer. Protein samples were separated on 4%­12% Bis-Tris gels (Novex).
