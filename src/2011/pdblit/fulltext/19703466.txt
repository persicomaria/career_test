G facilitates the receptor coupling of G,GDP, stabilizes its GDP bound state, and prevents spontaneous nucleotide exchange, thus serving as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) (Higashijima et al., 1987). Ligand-activated GPCRs serve as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), catalyzing exchange of GDP for GTP on G. GTP binding alters the conformation of three flexible "switch" regions within G, leading to G dissociation. Both G,GTP and G subsequently regulate several downstream effectors, including adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases, kinases, and ion channels (Cabrera-Vera et al., 2003; McCudden et al., 2005). Based on sequence similarity and functional differences in effector regulation, G proteins are grouped into four distinct families: Gi/o, Gs, Gq/11, and G12/13 (Cabrera-Vera et al., 2003; McCudden et al., 2005). Signal termination is achieved by the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of G and is accelerated by "regulators of G protein signaling" proteins (RGS proteins; Neubig and Siderovski, 2002). Formation of G,GDP causes heterotrimer reassociation, thereby preventing further effector interactions by either G or G. Accordingly, the duration of G protein signaling is determined by the lifetime of G in the GTP bound state (Sprang, 1997). Thus, G proteins serve as temporal regulators of signaling pathways, and understanding the molecular determinants of their guanine nucleotide cycle is of particular interest. Structures of G subunits, including Gi1, in both inactive and activated states have revealed critical conformational changes that occur during GTP binding and hydrolysis (Sprang, 1997). G consists of a Ras-like domain, a structural fold present in many GTPases, and a unique all-helical domain. Bound nucleotide resides in a cleft between these two domains. Although flexibility between these domains is thought to govern the rate of spontaneous nucleotide exchange (Remmers et al., 1999), the mechanism whereby G GEFs induce nucleotide exchange is not yet clear. Two distinct types of G GEFs are now known: membrane bound GPCRs and the soluble cytoplasmic RIC-8 proteins. The structure of the prototypical GPCR rhodopsin provided the first structural glimpse of the most prominent class of G GEFs (Palczewski et al., 2000); however, the receptor was in an inactive form and was not bound to heterotrimer. Thus, little direct information was gained about the mechanism for G protein activation. The nonreceptor G GEF RIC-8 is widely conserved across metazoa as a critical determinant (along with Gi subunits) in mitotic spindle force generation during mitosis (reviewed in McCudden et al., 2005). Unlike the GEFs for Ras superfamily GTPases, such as the RhoGEF family (Rossman et al., 2005), that have no preference for nucleotide state (GDP or GTP bound), RIC-8 exhibits selective interaction with the GDP bound state of G subunits and does not bind nor act as a GEF toward G,GTP (Afshar et al., 2004; Tall et al., 2003). As RIC-8

Summary Heterotrimeric G proteins are molecular switches that regulate numerous signaling pathways involved in cellular physiology. This characteristic is achieved by the adoption of two principal states: an inactive, GDP bound state and an active, GTP bound state. Under basal conditions, G proteins exist in the inactive, GDP bound state; thus, nucleotide exchange is crucial to the onset of signaling. Despite our understanding of G protein signaling pathways, the mechanism of nucleotide exchange remains elusive. We employed phage display technology to identify nucleotide statedependent G binding peptides. Herein, we report a GDP-selective G binding peptide, KB-752, that enhances spontaneous nucleotide exchange of G i subunits. Structural determination of the G i1/peptide complex reveals unique changes in the G switch regions predicted to enhance nucleotide exchange by creating a GDP dissociation route. Our results cast light onto a potential mechanism by which G subunits adopt a conformation suitable for nucleotide exchange. Introduction Heterotrimeric G proteins are crucial intracellular mediators of a diverse array of extracellular signals, including hormones, photons, odorants, and small molecules (Cabrera-Vera et al., 2003; McCudden et al., 2005).

proteins have only been recently discovered, structural studies of these proteins have yet to be reported. Thus, the structural determinants of G activation by GEFs remain largely unknown. Phage display is a powerful technique in identifying small peptides capable of binding desired targets in an unbiased manner. Identified peptides can then serve as tools for studying target protein binding surfaces, protein-protein interaction sites, and protein function and regulation (reviewed in Rodi et al., 2002). This technology has identified peptide modulators of a variety of enzyme classes and signaling molecules (e.g., Ashraf et al., 2003; Hyde-DeRuyscher et al., 2000). In particular, phage display and similar approaches have been used to investigate G protein binding interfaces on GPCRs (Gilchrist et al., 1998; Martin et al., 1996) and effector binding regions on G subunits (Scott et al., 2001), as well as to identify peptides with G protein regulatory properties, including both GEF and GDI activities (Hessling et al., 2003; Ja and Roberts, 2004). In the present study, we have identified guanine nucleotide-dependent G binding peptides from a phage display peptide library. In particular, we describe the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of a GDP-selective peptide, termed KB-752. To understand the mechanism of KB752 GEF activity, we determined the crystal structure of the peptide bound to Gi1. To our knowledge, these studies are the first to describe the structure of a G subunit in complex with a GEF and provide direct structural evidence in support of a previously proposed mechanism for the GPCR-catalyzed nucleotide exchange reaction. Results Identification of Nucleotide-Dependent G Binding Peptides We used phage display to obtain peptides that recognize the distinct conformations of G when bound to GDP versus GTPS (Cabrera-Vera et al., 2003; Sprang, 1997). Biotinylated Gi1,GDP and Gi1,GTPS were independently immobilized onto streptavidin-coated microtiter plates for selection of phage-displayed peptides. Phage selectivity was monitored by comparing phage ELISA signals between wells containing Gi1 and wells blocked with albumin. After four iterative rounds of selection, clonal bacteriophage isolates were purified, amplified, and screened for selective binding to Gi1 in GDP or GTPS bound states (e.g., Figure 1A). In total, we isolated 51 GDP-dependent, 12 GTPSdependent, and 5 nucleotide state-independent phagedisplayed peptides. Extensive database searches suggest that none of these peptides has sequence similarity to known G interacting proteins (data not shown). A representative group of GDP-dependent phages (Figure 1B) showed strong sequence similarity around the motif TWXE/DFL. Of these GDP-selective peptides, we focused initially on KB-752. Nucleotide-dependent G binding was quantitated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements on a streptavidin biosensor chip coated with biotinylated KB-752 (e.g., Figure 1C for Gi1). Dissociation constants (Kd values) were ob-

tained by simultaneous kinetic analysis of on (ka) and off (kd) rates obtained by injecting increasing concentrations of G in GDP, GDP,AlF4-, and GTPS bound states (e.g., Figure 1D for Gi1,GDP). In agreement with the phage selection, KB-752 displayed highest-affinity binding to Gi1 in its GDP bound form (Kd of 3.9 ± 0.6 M). No appreciable binding was observed to the transition state-mimetic form of Gi1,GDP,AlF4-, although measurable (albeit low-affinity) binding was observed for Gi1,GTPS (Kd of 28.0 ± 3.2 M); given the slow rate of spontaneous nucleotide exchange of Gi1 (Fields and Casey, 1997), this observed binding may be due to residual GDP bound protein. KB-752 demonstrated lower affinity for the closely related Go, with a Kd of 18.2 ± 3.0 M for Go,GDP, but no measurable interaction with GDP,AlF4- nor GTPS bound forms of Go (data not shown). KB-752 Binding Affects Guanine Nucleotide Exchange To examine the effects of KB-752 on nucleotide exchange by G binding partners, [35S]GTPS binding to purified G was quantified in the absence or presence of peptide. KB-752 enhanced the nucleotide exchange rate of Gi1 (Figure 2A); the effective concentration for 50% maximal response (EC50) for KB-752 GEF activity on Gi1 was 5.6 ± 1.1 M (Figure 2B), comparable to its observed Kd. Equipotent GEF activity was found for both Gi2 and Gi3 (Figure 2B). KB-752 did not affect the nucleotide exchange rate of Gi212 (Figure 2C), suggesting that KB-752 cannot disrupt a native heterotrimer and interacts solely with free G. Despite binding to Go,GDP, KB-752 did not affect nucleotide exchange even at saturating concentrations (Figure 2D). We hypothesized that the higher intrinsic rate of spontaneous nucleotide exchange of Go versus Gi contributes to the lack of KB-752 activity on Go. To test this, we purified Gi1 containing an arginine 144 to alanine (R144A) mutation that disrupts an interaction between the all-helical and Ras-like domains and thus renders the spontaneous exchange rate equivalent to that of Go (Remmers et al., 1999) (confirmed in Figure 3A). KB-752 did not enhance the exchange rate of Gi1(R144A) (Figure 3B), highlighting the mechanism of KB-752 as enhancing GDP release from the intrinsically slow-exchanger Gi. To validate these results, we employed steady-state GTPase assays. Given that GDP release is the rate-limiting step of the G guanine nucleotide cycle, any alteration of GDP release, either positively (i.e., GEF activity) or negatively (i.e., GDI activity), will be reflected in the overall steady-state rate of GTP hydrolysis (Ross, 2002). KB-752 enhanced steady-state GTP hydrolysis by Gi1 (Figure 3C), further indicating that it has GEF activity for Gi subunits. No effect of KB-752 was seen on Go. These results support the conclusion that KB-752 possesses Gi-selective GEF activity. Structure of KB-752 Bound to G i1 To ascertain the molecular mechanism of KB-752 GEF activity, we determined the structure of KB-752 bound Gi1,GDP (PDB ID 1Y3A; Figure 4 and Table 1). KB-752 assumes a partial -helical structure and binds Gi1 be-

(D) GDP bound Gi1 was injected at each indicated concentration over immobilized KB752 to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for this interaction pair. SPR-derived dissociation constants for the interaction of KB-752 with Gi1 and Go, in their ground state (GDP bound), transition state-mimetic (GDP,AlF4- bound), and activated state (GTPS bound) forms, were obtained from analyses (n = 4­6 for each state) similar to that shown in (D). Dissociation constants of >1000 M were obtained for both G subunits in their GDP,AlF4- bound form, and for Go bound to GTPS.

tween switch II and the 3 helix of the Ras-like domain (Figures 4 and 5A). The repositioning of switch II affords the binding groove for KB-752, as the 3 helix is not significantly altered in conformation compared to other structures of Gi1. Indeed, the ability to reposition switch II likely defines the nucleotide specificity of KB-752 binding, given predicted steric hindrance between the N terminus of KB-752 and switch II within Gi1,GTPS and Gi1,GDP,AlF4- (Figure 5B). In particular, the positioning of tryptophan 211 of switch II would not accommodate tryptophan 5 of KB-752 (Figure 5B); however, tryptophan 211 is repositioned in the Gi1,GDP/KB-752 structure and creates part of a criti-

cal hydrophobic pocket used by KB-752 for binding (see below). The switch II/3 helix binding pocket for KB-752 is similar to that of the N-terminal  helix of the RGS14 GoLoco motif, a short polypeptide that displays GDI activity toward Gi1 (PDB ID 1KJY) (Kimple et al., 2002); however, the GoLoco motif binding site extends into the all-helical domain (Figure 5C), whereas KB-752 makes no contacts with this region of Gi1 (Figure 5A). The lack of functional contacts made between KB-752 and the all-helical domain was validated by using a chimera ("Gioi") with the Ras-like domain of Gi1 but the all-helical domain of Go (Remmers et al., 1999); KB-

752 displays GEF activity on this chimera equal to that on wild-type Gi1 (Figure 5D), suggesting that interactions with the Ras-like domain are sufficient for GEF activity. The use of a switch II/3 helix binding pocket for both KB-752 and GoLoco motif peptides was also validated biochemically. The GEF activity of KB-752 on Gi1 was found to be competitively antagonized by the GoLoco motif of the RGS14 paralog, RGS12 (Figure 5E). Unlike the GoLoco motif, which lies over the GDP binding pocket and uses an arginine finger to stabilize GDP (Kimple et al., 2002), KB-752 does not occlude nor make contact with GDP (Figure 5A versus Figure 5C), suggesting that its GEF activity relies on conformational changes induced within Gi1. In support of these distinct modes of interaction about the GDP binding pocket, KB-752 binding has almost no effect on the rate by which Gi1 is activated by aluminum tetrafluoride (Figure 5F), unlike the inhibitory effect of GoLoco motif peptides (Willard et al., 2004). Structural Basis for the Conserved TWXE/DFL Binding Motif Figure 6 shows specific contacts between KB-752 and Gi1. Glutamate 11 (E11) of KB-752 forms a salt bridge with R208 of Gi1. Tryptophan 5 (W5) is found within a hydrophobic pocket formed by F215, L249, and I253 of Gi1. Phenylalanine 8 (F8) is also placed within a hydrophobic environment established by W211, I212, and F215 of Gi1. The burial of large hydrophobic residues within the hydrophobic groove between switch II and the 3 helix is common among several known G binding partners: p115RhoGEF-RGS inserts a methionine (M165) into the Gi/13 chimera (Chen et al., 2005), the C2 domain of adenylyl cyclase inserts a phenylalanine (F991) into Gs (Tesmer et al., 1997b), and the  subunit of cGMP-phosphodiesterase inserts a tryptophan (W70) into Gt (Slep et al., 2001). Burial of the peptide residues W5 and F8 within Gi1 validates the results of the phage selection, as these two hydrophobic residues figure prominently within the TWXE/DFL binding motif (Figure 1B). An intramolecular hydrogen bond network between threonine 4 (T4) and both the side chain carboxylate and peptide bond nitrogen of aspartate 7 (D7) (Figure 6B) underscores the conservation of threonine and acidic residues within the TWXE/DFL motif. Specifically, the side chain hydroxyl of T4 forms a hydrogen bond with both the side chain carboxylate and main chain amide nitrogen of D7, and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of T4 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain amide nitrogen of D7. Additionally, this hydrogen bonding network within the -helical portion of KB-752 serve to orient both W5 and F8 side chains toward the G binding face of the peptide. Based on contacts between KB-752 and Gi1, we generated three KB-752 variants to validate biochemically the structural model. E11 was replaced with leucine to eliminate the ionic interaction with R208. W5

KB-752 GEF Activity Increases Steady-State GTP Hydrolysis by Gi1, but Does Not Act on a Gi1 Point Mutant with Accelerated Spontaneous Nucleotide Release (A) 200 nM wild-type (wt) Gi1, R144A Gi1, or wt Go was added to cuvettes containing 1 M BODIPY-FL-GTPS. Real-time nucleotide binding (Kimple et al., 2004) was measured at 25°C as an increase in fluorescence response (ex = 485 nm; em = 530 nm; slit widths of 3.0 nm) upon binding BODIPY-FL-GTPS. Mutation of arginine 144 to alanine (R144A) resulted in Gi1 nucleotide binding kinetics indistinguishable from that of Go, as previously reported by Remmers and colleagues (Remmers et al., 1999). (B) KB-752 does not alter the rate of GTPS binding by the mutant Gi1 subunit (R144A) with accelerated spontaneous nucleotide exchange comparable to that of wild-type Go (experiment performed as in Figure 2A, except conducted at 20°C). Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate samples from a representative experiment of three independent experiments conducted. (C) Confirming the GEF activity of KB-752 on wild-type Gi1, addition of KB-752 (100 M) to G (200 nM) enhances the steady-state hydrolysis of [-32P]GTP by Gi1, but has no effect on Go. Note

that the rate-limiting step in steady-state hydrolysis of GTP by G subunits is release of product (i.e., GDP) and not the hydrolysis of GTP per se (Ross, 2002). Data shown are the mean ± SEM for five independent experiments conducted in triplicate.

and F8 of the TWXE/DFL motif were each independently replaced with alanine to reduce the potential for burial within hydrophobic environments created by switch II and the 3 helix. We first confirmed by SPR that each mutation abrogated Gi1 binding. Gi1,GDP was capable of interacting with the E11L peptide, but binding was significantly attenuated compared to wild-type (Figure 6C). Both W5A and F8A peptides displayed a near complete loss of binding to Gi1,GDP. We then tested the ability of each peptide to enhance nucleotide exchange by Gi1,GDP. Wild-type KB-752 resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in the rate of [35S]GTPS binding. The E11L peptide had diminished GEF activity compared to wild-type (Figure 6D), while W5A and F8A peptides lacked significant GEF activity. These results corroborate the critical contacts made between Gi1 and these residues of KB-752 in the structural model. Structural Basis for KB-752 GEF Activity Exchange of GDP for GTP results in movement of the three switch regions to stabilize bound GTP and adopt the conformation responsible for effector binding (Sprang, 1997). Gi1,GDP/KB-752 possesses significant alterations in each switch region compared to G,GDP/G12 (Figure 7A). Most apparent is switch II, which is displaced down and outward compared to the Gi1,GDP/G12 structure (Wall et al., 1995). This movement results in the lip of switch II, normally ordered and helical in the GTPS bound state (Coleman et al., 1994; Sunahara et al., 1997), being displaced away from the nucleotide binding pocket and GDP. This conformation

in Gi1,GDP/KB-752 contrasts with the movement of switch II toward the nucleotide pocket when GTPS is bound. Switch III is also slightly displaced from GDP within KB-752 bound Gi1 compared to the heterotrimer (Figure 7A). However, of the four Gi1/KB-752 dimers in the asymmetric unit (Table 1), only one Gi1 molecule (chain B of PDB ID 1Y3A) had sufficient electron density to accurately model the switch III loop, suggesting that this region of Gi1 is inherently flexible even when bound to KB-752. Similar alterations to both switch regions II and III are seen in GoLoco bound Gi1 (Gi1,GDP/R14GL) (Kimple et al., 2002); however, switch II is more dramatically displaced in Gi1,GDP/ KB-752 (Figure 7B). Interestingly, despite movement in switch II, the 3/2 loop at the entry to switch II is not significantly displaced in the Gi1,GDP/R14GL structure compared to the Gi1,GDP/G12 structure (Figure 7A versus Figure 7B). In contrast, this 3/2 loop is removed from the guanine nucleotide pocket along with switch II in the Gi1,GDP/KB-752 structure (Figure 7B). Displacement of the 3/2 loop is stabilized through several interactions with KB-752, including hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of glycine 202 of the 3/2 loop and the indole nitrogen of tryptophan 5 in KB-752 (Figure 7C), indicating an additional role for this key peptide residue. The displacement of switch II positions the catalytic glutamine 204 residue far from the nucleotide binding pocket compared to structures of Gi1,GTPS and Gi1,GDP,AlF4- (Figure 8), and this residue makes an intramolecular bond with valine 201 (Figure 7C). Switch I within Gi1,GDP/KB-752 adopts a confor-

ure 8C) (Coleman et al., 1994) in which R178 is oriented to participate in GTP hydrolysis by stabilization of the leaving  phosphate group as mimicked by the aluminum tetrafluoride anion. These findings suggest that the R178/E43 interaction is broken during nucleotide exchange and that an "unbuckled seatbeat" conformation may be essential for GDP release in addition to GTP hydrolysis. Thus, KB-752 appears to alter switch I and II to create a feasible exit route for GDP (see Discussion below). Magnesium was not observed in the nucleotide binding pocket of Gi1,GDP/KB-752 (although its coordinating residue T181 is unaltered; Figures 8C and 8D), consistent with studies showing that Mg2+ has no effect on GDP binding to G (e.g., Higashijima et al., 1987). Discussion Despite many biochemical and structural studies of the guanine nucleotide cycle, the mechanism of heterotrimeric G protein activation remains elusive. Mutagenesis studies have highlighted several determinants governing the G protein coupling and nucleotide exchange properties of GPCRs (Bourne, 1997; Hamm, 2001), but precisely how a G subunit is induced to exchange GDP for GTP has remained unanswered, given the inherent difficulty in obtaining structural information on the GPCR/G protein complex. Structural determinants of recently described GEF activity of RIC-8 (Afshar et al., 2004; Tall et al., 2003) are also not known. An alternative approach has been the use of small peptides that possess nucleotide-dependent binding and biochemical properties akin to known G protein regulators. Mastoparan, a 14 aa peptide found in wasp venom, is a GEF for Gi and Go (Higashijima et al., 1990). The solution structure of mastoparan bound to Gi indicates a helical conformation for this peptide; however, biochemical studies suggest that its binding interface resides at the extended N terminus of G (Sukumar and Higashijima, 1992). Moreover, mastoparan (INLKALAALAKKIL) shows no similarity to the TWXE/ DFL motif found in KB-752 and other G,GDP binding peptides from our screen. Synthetic peptides from the third intracellular loop of several GPCRs, a region involved in G protein coupling and activation by receptor, have also been used to study G protein activation. A solution structure of a peptide from the third intracellular loop of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor suggests the necessity for a helical conformation (Ulfers et al., 2002). Finally, phage display has identified short heptapeptides with biochemical activity at specific G protein subunits (Hessling et al., 2003), although no structural information has been reported. Our results further highlight the power of phage display as a useful technique to identify conformation-dependent binding peptides that can be useful tools in investigating protein function. The structure of the Gi1,GDP/KB-752 complex clearly demonstrates the basis of nucleotide specificity of this peptide. Furthermore, our structural determination of KB-752 bound to Gi1 represents the first glimpse of a G subunit bound to a GEF. As with other G regulators, KB752 modulates the conformation of the switch regions

mation more similar to the activated states of Gi1, GTPS and Gi1,GDP,AlF4- (Figure 8), moving in closer proximity to GDP (compared to G and GoLoco bound states) and affecting the position of arginine 178 (R178) (Figure 8A). In the Gi1,GDP/G12 heterotrimer (PDB 1GP2) (Wall et al., 1995), R178 of switch I forms a salt bridge interaction with glutamate 43 (E43) across the bound GDP (Figure 8A). This "seatbelt" conformation, resulting from reoriented coordinating residues N149 and D150 due to G12 binding (Wall et al., 1998), is proposed to stabilize bound GDP (Lambright et al., 1996; Wall et al., 1995). This same interaction occurs in Gi1,GDP/R14GL (Kimple et al., 2002) (Figure 8A), but not in the structures of free Gi1,GDP (Wall et al., 1998), suggesting that the formation of this R178/E43 salt bridge represents a common mechanism used by GDIs for Gi1. Interestingly, in the KB-752 bound structure, the seatbelt interaction is not present (Figures 8A and 8B); the conformation of R178 is nearly identical to that of the Gi1,GDP,AlF4- transition state (PDB 1GFI) (Fig-

KB-752 peptide (red, translucent) binds Gi1 between switch II and the 3 helix; the conformations of these two helices are shown for Gi1,GDP/ KB-752 (green), Gi1,GTPS (yellow), and Gi1,GDP,AlF4- (magenta). Whereas the 3 helix is not significantly altered, switch II is displaced to accommodate KB-752 binding. Switch II in both Gi1,GTPS and Gi1, GDP,AlF4- assumes an extended -helical conformation that is stabilized relative to Gi1,GDP (Mixon et al., 1995; Sprang, 1997). This conformation of switch II is not permissive to KB-752 binding, as it creates extensive steric hindrance. In particular, W211 of switch II (shown in space filling) is in a restrictive position relative to W5 of KB-752. (C) The GoLoco motif of RGS14 (orange) is also seen to bind, in an -helical conformation, between switch II and the 3 helix of Gi1 (PDB ID 1KJY); the critical arginine finger which contacts GDP is highlighted within the C carbon ribbon trace of the GoLoco peptide. Other features are colored as in (A). (D) KB-752 GEF activity does not rely on the all-helical domain. 100 nM Gi1 or a chimeric G containing the Ras-like domain of Gi1 and the all-helical domain of Go ("Gioi" [Remmers et al., 1999]) was incubated in the absence or presence of 50 M KB-752, and [35S]GTPS binding after 10 min at 30°C was measured as described in the Experimental Procedures. Data are expressed as a percentage of GTPS bound relative to G protein in the absence of KB-752 ("Control") and are the average ± SEM of four independent experiments. Data shown are the mean ± SEM for five independent experiments conducted in triplicate. (E) The KB-752 binding site on Gi1 overlaps that of GoLoco motif peptides. Gi1 (50 nM) was incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of a peptide representing the GoLoco motif of RGS12 (R12GL) (Kimple et al., 2002). GTPS binding was then measured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of KB-752. Data are expressed as fmol of GTPS bound above that measured in the absence of KB-752 and are from a representative experiment of three independent experiments. (F) The binding of KB-752 has no effect on the kinetics of Gi1 activation by AlF4-, unlike the slowed activation rate seen upon GoLoco peptide binding. Gi1-CFP (200 nM) and YFP-RGS4 (280 nM) fusion proteins, previously shown to generate increased fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) upon Gi1 activation by AlF4- and subsequent RGS-box binding (Willard et al., 2004), were mixed together and preincubated with either 10 M KB-752 peptide or 5 M GoLoco consensus peptide (AGS3Con [Kimple et al., 2002]), prior to the addition of NaF and AlCl3 to final concentrations of 20 mM and 30 M, respectively, at the 150 s mark.

critical to the guanine nucleotide cycle (Sprang, 1997). Previous structures of uncomplexed Gi1,GDP have revealed structural disorder in these switch regions, particularly switch II and III (Coleman and Sprang, 1998). However, in structures in which Gi1 is bound to regulators (G, RGS4, GoLoco motif) or is in the activated state (GTPS or GDP,AlF4- bound), the switch regions become ordered in specific, defined conformations (Coleman et al., 1994; Kimple et al., 2002; Tesmer et al., 1997a; Wall et al., 1995). Similarly, our structure of Gi1,GDP/KB-752 reveals order in the switch regions, suggesting that the peptide stabilizes this conformation resulting in its GEF activity--specifically by creating a stabilized route for GDP egress. Since the G nucleotide binding pocket is buried far from the proposed G/receptor interacting surface, it is thought that GPCRs use G as a lever to "pull open" G, creating a GDP exit route. By modeling onto G the structural changes in EF-Tu induced by EF-Ts during

nucleotide exchange, Bourne and colleagues have pointed to the 3/2 loop as a potential "lip" that occludes GDP release (Iiri et al., 1998). G makes several contacts with this region and has been proposed to use additional contacts within the 2 helix (switch II), namely, D228 of G1 contacting K210 in Gi1 (K206 in Gs), to lever open the lip to induce GDP release (Rondard et al., 2001). GPCRs are thought to use the G N terminus to tilt G (making extensive contacts with the G N terminus) away from G, thereby opening the 3/ 2 lip (Iiri et al., 1998). Our structure of the GEF peptide KB-752 bound to Gi1 supports the Bourne model. By binding between the switch II and 3 helices, KB-752 pushes the 2 helix away from nucleotide, similar to the proposed levering action of G. Displacement of switch II results in the 3/2 loop (part of the proposed occlusive lip [Iiri et al., 1998]) also being pulled away from nucleotide in a way that might allow more efficient GDP egress. Whereas switch II is displaced by the

Figure 6. Biochemical Confirmation of Specific Interactions between KB-752 and Gi1 (A) Positions of KB-752 residues W5, F8, and E11 relative to residues in the switch II and 3 helices of Gi1. W5 and F8 are placed within hydrophobic pockets formed by Gi1 residues F215, L249, and I253, and W211, I212, and F215, respectively. E11 forms a salt bridge with R208 of Gi1. (B) Peptide residues T4 and D7 of the conserved TWXE/DFL binding motif form an intrapeptide hydrogen bond network that helps to orient W5 and F8. (C and D) Effects of W5A, F8A, and E11L mutations on KB-752 activity. (C) Indicated KB752 mutant or wild-type (wt) peptides were each immobilized to a density of w1000 RUs on separate streptavidin-coated flow cells, and 50 M GDP bound Gi1 ("analyte") was injected simultaneously over all four surfaces. (D) Compared to the increase in GTPS binding observed by addition of 50 M wild-type KB-752 to 100 nM Gi1,GDP, substantial reduction of GEF activity is seen upon mutation to the W5, F8, or E11 residue of KB-752. Data shown in (D) are the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate samples from a representative experiment of three independent experiments conducted.

binding of the RGS14 GoLoco peptide, the 3/2 loop remains essentially unaltered in conformation compared to the G bound, heterotrimeric structure. These results further highlight the potential role of the 3/2 loop as an occlusive lip preventing GDP release, as both G and GoLoco (each with GDI activity) position

the 3/2 loop to block the proposed GDP egress route, whereas KB-752 (with GEF activity) removes the loop from this position. Importantly, not only does KB752 displace the 3/2 loop from its occlusive orientation, but it also makes several contacts with this loop, which presumably serve to stabilize its reorientation.

Conformational Changes in G Switch Regions Induced by KB-752 Binding (A and B) Relative orientations of the three switch regions (SI­III) in heterotrimer (PDB code 1GP2; blue in [A]), Gi1,GDP/R14GL (PDB code 1KJY; orange in [B]), and Gi1,GDP/KB-752 (green). Movement of switch II (2 helix) and the connected 3/2 loop away from the nucleotide binding pocket in Gi1,GDP/KB-752 is thought to contribute to GEF activity by creating a route for GDP release. The RGS14 GoLoco motif peptide (R14GL) displaces switch II but does not significantly alter the position of the 3/ 2 loop. (C) Binding of KB-752 displaces switch II, resulting in a reorientation of the 3/2 loop away from the guanine nucleotide pocket. KB-752 (red) stabilizes the 3/2 loop (green) via several hydrogen bonds (indicated as yellow dashes), including the carbonyl oxygen of G202 (G) with the indole nitrogen of W5 (KB-752), and the side chain hydroxyl and main chain amide nitrogen of S206 (G) with the main chain amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen of V3 (KB-752), respectively. A water molecule (magenta ball) is coordinated by both G and KB-752 contacts.

Figure 8. Comparison of Switch Regions and Core Catalytic Residues of KB-752 Bound Gi1 with Other States of Gi1 (A) Movement of switch I in the Gi1,GDP/ KB-752 complex (green), versus its position in the Gi112 heterotrimer (blue) and the Gi1,GDP/R14GL complex (orange), results in disruption of a salt bridge (black dotted line) between R178 and E43 that normally stabilizes bound GDP (magenta) within Gi1 when complexed to a GDI (G or GoLoco peptide). (B) Electron density of the R178 side chain in the Gi1,GDP/KB-752 complex (from a 2Fo - Fc simulated annealing composite omit map contoured to a level of 1) is denoted by white mesh. In the background is the  phosphate of the bound GDP (P). (C and D) Switch region comparisons with activated Gi1 states. Switch regions of Gi1,GDP/KB-752 (green), Gi1,GDP,AlF4- (PDB code 1GFI; magenta; [C]), and Gi1, GTPS (PDB code 1GIA; yellow; [D]) are shown along with the residues critical for GTP hydrolysis (R178 and T181 within switch I and Q204 within switch II). GDP from the Gi1,GDP/KB-752 structure is shown for reference in each case. Overall conformation of the switch regions of Gi1,GDP,AlF4- and Gi1,GTPS are very similar, save for key changes in the position of catalytic residue side chains (Wall et al., 1998). Whereas switch I of Gi1,GDP/KB-752 is very similar to that of the activated forms, both switch II and III are dramatically removed from the guanine nucleotide to allow for GDP release. The catalytic Q204 residue within switch II is far removed from the bound nucleotide and active site for GTP hydrolysis in the Gi1,GDP/KB-752 structure. However, R178 and T181 of switch I are in a strikingly similar position to that of the Gi1,GDP,AlF4- structure.

Although the precise structural determinants of GPCRmediated GEF activity will clearly be distinct from that of our artificial phage-displayed peptide GEF, the structural changes in Gi1 induced by KB-752 provide support for the G-levering model of receptor GEF function by suggesting that repositioning of switch II and the 3/2 loop is critical for GDP release. In this model, the proposed egress route for GDP is toward the G binding face of G, which is more accessible following the displacement of the occlusive 3/2 loop. An alternative opinion on receptor-mediated heterotrimer activation (Cherfils and Chabre, 2003) suggests that GPCRs use the G N terminus to maneuver G in an opposite fashion to that proposed in the Bourne model. In this "gear-shift" model, G is shifted toward G, resulting in a closely packing G-G interface stabilized by a proposed binding of the G N terminus to the G helical domain (Cherfils and Chabre, 2003). This G shift is proposed to alter the conformation of the 5 helix, previously implicated in the receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange reaction (Marin et al., 2002). Our structure of Gi1,GDP/KB-752, while not invalidating the receptor GEF model of Cherfils and Chabre given lack of sequence similarity between KB-752 and known G regulators, certainly does not support their model of GPCR GEF activity for three reasons: (i) KB752 causes switch II to be displaced away from the GDP pocket rather than being packed more tightly, (ii) the proposed GDP exit route induced by KB-752 binding is on the G binding face, and (iii) KB-752 does not cause significant alterations in 5 helix conformation. In addition to affecting switch II (2 helix) and maneuvering the 3/2 loop in a manner consistent with the

G-lever model (Iiri et al., 1998), KB-752 binding also alters switch I. In contrast to displacement of switch II away from the nucleotide binding pocket, switch I is displaced slightly toward this pocket into a similar conformation to that of GTPS and GDP,AlF4- bound G. In the Gi1,GDP/G12 heterotrimer and Gi1,GDP/ R14GL complex, R178 of switch I forms a salt bridge with E43 (an interaction not observed in free Gi1,GDP), forming a "seatbelt" over bound GDP thought to aid in the stabilization of G,GDP by G or GoLoco binding (Kimple et al., 2002; Lambright et al., 1996; Wall et al., 1995). Switch I in the Gi1,GDP/KB-752 structure reveals an R178 conformation out of bonding distance to E43, similar to that seen in the structure of free Gi1,GDP, in which R178 is thought to be quite flexible (Mixon et al., 1995). The loss of the R178/E43 interaction in both the Gi1,GDP/KB-752 (GEF) structure as well as in free Gi1,GDP (which has higher spontaneous nucleotide exchange compared to G bound) supports the loss of this interaction as coinciding with nucleotide exchange. Thus, breaking the R178/E43 "GDP seatbelt" is a potentially crucial step in GDP release and subsequent GTP binding. Surprisingly, the R178 side chain is in a nearly identical conformation in the Gi1,GDP/KB-752 structure compared to the Gi1, GDP,AlF4- structure (Figure 7B), indicating that this residue potentially adopts a conformation that is suitable for both GDP/GTP exchange and GTP hydrolysis. Having the R178/E43 interaction disrupted, along with creating a feasible exit route by modulating the switch II helix, may contribute to enhanced GDP release and, thus, an enhanced nucleotide exchange rate observed upon KB-752 binding.

Structure 1078

Despite the GEF activity of KB-752 toward Gi1, the structure of the complex contains bound GDP. This seemingly paradoxical observation is explained by several considerations. The nucleotide-free state of isolated G is very unstable, likely reflecting an instantaneous conformation as nucleotide binding is extremely rapid (Ferguson et al., 1986; Sprang, 1997); stable trapping of the nucleotide-free state has only recently been successfully described following binding to the nonreceptor GEF RIC-8 (Tall and Gilman, 2004). The G/ RIC-8 interface is likely more extensive than with the small KB-752 peptide, which would add substantial stability to the nucleotide-free conformation. Similarly, establishing the nucleotide-free state of small GTPases also necessitates a large stabilizing interface with respective GEFs (e.g., Worthylake et al., 2000) that cannot be provided by the small KB-752 peptide. Along with the fact that the Gi1/KB-752 complex was crystallized in the presence of 5 M GDP, these factors likely impeded the chances of capturing Gi1 in a nucleotidefree state. In conclusion, our identification and structural analysis of a G,GDP binding peptide with GEF activity toward Gi1­3 subunits provides support of the "G lever" hypothesis of GPCR GEF activity. The activity of KB-752 as a GEF for Gi suggests a future utility of this peptide as a new molecular tool to study heterotrimeric G protein signaling in vitro and in vivo.
Experimental Procedures Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were from Sigma. Peptides were synthesized by Anaspec (San Jose, CA). Biotinylated peptides were synthesized by Dr. Michael Berne and colleagues of the Tufts University Core Facility: biotinylation was performed on resin bound, Fmoc group-protected synthetic peptides that were selectively deprotected only at their N termini, assuring that biotin conjugation occurred solely at the free amine. Phage Selection Biotinylated Gi1 was purified from E. coli as described in Kimple et al., (2004): the presence of an N-terminal AviTag sequence (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) allowed for selective in vivo biotinylation on the lysine residue during expression in E. coli strain AVB 100 that also expresses biotin ligase (BirA) and fermentation in free biotincontaining medium as per manufacturer's instructions (Avidity LCC, Denver, CO). A total of 19 different random peptide bacteriophage libraries were obtained from New England Biolabs (PhD7, PhD12) or prepared by Karo*Bio USA by using published methods (Sparks et al., 1996). Immulon 4 plates (96-well; Dynatech) were coated with streptavidin in 0.1 M NaHCO3, blocked with 1.0% BSA in 0.1 M NaHCO3, then incubated for 1 hr at 25°C with 10 pmol/well of biotin-Gi1 in buffer A (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 16 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Tween-20) with either 5 M GDP or GTPS. Iterative selection of binding phage was performed by using published methods (Sparks et al., 1996). Briefly, after incubating phage libraries with immobilized biotin-Gi1 for 3 hr at 25°C, nonspecifically bound phages were removed by washing with TBST buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween20) with 0.5 mM biotin. Bound phages were eluted sequentially with a low-pH glycine buffer and a high-pH ethanolamine buffer; after neutralizing the pH, phages were amplified and subjected to repeat rounds of selection (Sparks et al., 1996). After four iterations, clonal phage isolates were purified, amplified, and sequenced as described (Sparks et al., 1996). To detect bound phage by ELISA, biotin-Gi1 was incubated overnight in buffer A with either 100 M GDP or GTPS, and then 1 pmol Gi1/ well (or buffer A alone) was immobilized onto plates as previously described. A total of 5 l phage was added to each well in buffer

A with either 100 M GDP or GTPS and was incubated for 30 min at 25°C. Unbound phage was removed by TBST washes, and bound phage was detected with an anti-M13 antibody/horseradish peroxidase conjuguate. Assays were developed for 10 min at room temperature by adding 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6 sulfonic acid and H2O2. Signal development was stopped by adding SDS to a final concentration of 1%. Protein Purification His6-tagged human Gi1 (full-length, R144A mutant, and N-end 25 aa truncated) and human GoA (full-length) were purified from BL21(DE3) E. coli as previously described (Kimple et al., 2004). Gi1 and Go were induced at OD600 = 0.8 with 1 mM IPTG for 4 hr at 37°C. Gi212 was purified from Sf9 insect cells coinfected with baculoviruses encoding Gi2, G1, and His6-G2 as previously described (Hooks et al., 2003). Proteins were purified by Ni2+-NTA, anion exchange, and size exclusion chromatographies as described (Hooks et al., 2003; Kimple et al., 2004). All proteins were concentrated by using YM-10 centrifugal filters (Millipore). Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor Measurements SPR binding assays were performed at 25°C on a BIAcore 3000. To analyze nucleotide-dependent G binding, N-terminally biotinylated KB-752 (diluted to 0.1 g/ml in BIA running buffer [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.005% NP40]) was coupled to separate flow cells of streptavidin biosensors (Biacore) by using MANUAL INJECT to a surface density of w250, w500, or w1000 resonance units. Prior to injection, G subunits were diluted in BIA running buffer with 100 M GDP, 100 M GDP plus 30 M AlCl3 and 10 mM NaF, or 100 M GTPS and were incubated at 25°C for 2­3 hr. 30 l G subunit was then simultaneously injected (by using KINJECT) over flow cells at 10 l/min, followed by 300 s dissociation. Binding to a non-G interacting, biotinylated peptide (mNOTCH1; Snow et al., 2002) was subtracted from all binding curves to correct for nonspecific binding and buffer shifts. Surfaces were regenerated with two 10 l pulses of 500 mM NaCl/25 mM NaOH at 20 l/min. Binding curves and kinetic analyses were conducted by using BIAevaluation ver. 3.0 and were plotted by using GraphPad Prism ver. 4.0b. Binding affinities were calculated by using the simultaneous association (ka) and dissociation (kd) analysis parameter with generated sensorgram curves. G Nucleotide Cycle Assays GTPS exchange assays were conducted by using a nitrocellulose filter binding method (Afshar et al., 2004), with GTPS binding reactions performed at either 20°C (Go and Gi1-R144A) or 30°C (Gi1, i2, i3 and Gi212). Steady-state GTPase assays were carried out by using a charcoal precipitation-based method (Afshar et al., 2004), with reactions incubated at 20°C (Go) or 30°C (Gi) for 30 min. Crystallization and Structure Determination Crystals of KB-752 bound to Gi1 were obtained by vapor diffusion from hanging drops (3 l) containing a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of protein solution (6 mg/ml Gi1 N25 and 1.3-fold molar excess KB-752 in 20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 M GDP, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol) to well solution (50 mM sodium citrate [pH 5.0], 10% (w/w) PEG-8000, 10% (w/w) sucrose). Crystals formed in 3­5 days at 4°C in the space group P21 (a = 72.9 Å, b = 112.8 Å, c = 109.5 Å,  = 90°,  = 93.7°,  = 90°), with four Gi1,GDP/KB-752 heterodimers in the asymmetric unit. To collect data at 100 K, crystals were cryoprotected in 30% glycerol for 1 min, then submerged in liquid N2. A native data set was collected at the SER-CAT 22-ID beamline at APS, Argonne National Laboratory. Data were scaled and indexed by using the program HKL2000. The structure of Gi1,GDP,Mg2+ (PDB accession code 1BOF), excluding the 25 aa N terminus, aa 177­184 (switch I), aa 200­218 (switch II), aa 233­ 239 (switch III), and waters and sulphates, was used for molecular replacement with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). Model building was done in O (Jones et al., 1991), with successive rounds of simulated annealing, minimization, B group, and torsion angle refinements being completed by using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). All refinement was completed with noncrystallographic symmetry restraints, and each

Gi Binding Peptide with GEF Activity 1079

of the four Gi1,GDP/KB-752 dimers are essentially identical. Electron density maps for model building as well as the simulated annealing composite omit map were generated with CNS. Gi1 residues 26­33 (extreme N terminus), 113­116 (B-C loop, dubbed "switch IV," within the all-helical domain; Mixon et al., 1995), and 345­354 (extreme C terminus) were not included in the final model given incomplete electron density; prior to removal, each region had refined B factors of >150, indicative of low statistical certainty and relative disorder. Additionally, in three of the four Gi1 subunits (molecules "A," "C," and "D") in the asymmetric unit, residues 234­ 239 of switch III were removed from the final model. All structural images were made with PyMol (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA).
