2-Substituted-5-nitro-benzenesulfonamides incorporating a large variety of secondary/tertiary amines were explored as inhibitors of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1), with the aim of designing bioreductive inhibitors targeting the hypoxia overexpressed, tumor-associated isozymes. The compounds were ineffective inhibitors of the cytosolic isoform I, showed a better inhibition of the physiologically relevant CA II (KIs of 8.8-4975 nM), and strongly inhibited the tumor-associated CA IX and XII (KIs of 5.4-653 nM). Some of these compounds showed excellent selectivity ratios for the inhibition of the tumor-associated isozymes over the cytosolic ones (in the range of 10-1395). The X-ray crystal structure of the adduct of hCA II with the lead molecule 2-chloro-5-nitro-benzenesulfonamide as well as molecular modeling studies for interaction with hCA IX afforded a better understanding of factors governing the discrimination of the two isoforms for this type of bioreductive compound targeting specifically hypoxic tumors.
Introduction Carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1), the catalyst for the interconversion between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, is an essential enzyme all over the phylogenetic tree, being present in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes.1,2 In humans, the CAcatalyzed reaction is involved in respiration and transport of CO2/bicarbonate between metabolizing tissues and lungs, pH and CO2 homeostasis (as a proton is also generated during the catalytic turnover), electrolyte secretion in a variety of tissues/ organs, biosynthetic reactions (such as gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis and ureagenesis), bone resorption, tumorigenicity, and many other physiological and pathological processes.1,2 Many of the CA isozymes involved in these processes, among the 15 known in humans, are important therapeutic targets with the potential to be inhibited or activated to treat a wide range of disorders.1,2 The main class of CA inhibitors (CAIs) is constituted by substituted benzene sulfonamides and their bioisosteres (sulfamates, sulfamides, etc.), which bind to the Zn2+ ion of the enzyme, by substituting the nonprotein zinc ligand to generate a tetrahedral adduct and participating in various other favorable interactions with amino acid residues situated in the active site.1,2 Several such agents are clinically used drugs, such as acetazolamide AZA, methazolamide MZA, ethoxzolamide EZA, sulthiame SLT, dichlorophenamide DCP, dorzolamide DZA, brinzolamide BRZ, and indisulam IND.1,2 A critical problem in the design of CAIs is related to the high number of isoforms, their rather diffuse localization in many

tissues/organs, and the lack of isozyme selectivity of the presently available inhibitors.1,2 Hypoxia, a condition associated with many types of cancers, triggers a strong overexpression of at least two CA isozymes, i.e., CA IX and XII.3,4 CA IX belongs to the very active human CAs, its catalytic properties for the CO2 hydration reaction being comparable with those of the highly evolved catalyst CA II, whereas CA XII is slightly less effective.1­4 Like all mammalian CAs, CA IX and XII are susceptible to inhibition by sulfonamides/sulfamates/sulfamides and the inorganic atheir anions.5­7 The almost exclusive localization of CA IX (and to a less degree of CA XII) in tumors make these protein isoforms attractive targets for the design of conceptually novel antitumor therapies.1­4 In a preceding work we reported hypoxia-activatable sulfonamides incorporating disulfide functionalities.7 Here we extend the earlier work to sulfonamides incorporating nitro moieties, and we report the inhibitory activity of a series of such aromatic derivatives against the physiologically relevant isoforms I, II, and the tumor-associated ones CA IX and XII. X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling was also employed for rationalizing some of our results. Results and Discussion Chemistry and CA Inhibition Studies. Nitroaromatics and the structurally related N-oxides constitute an important class of therapeutic agents against a variety of protozoan and bacterial infections of humans and animals,8 as well as prodrugs (bioreductive agents), useful for the treatment or imaging of hypoxic tumors.8­13 Metronidazole MND is a well-known and widely clinically used representative of the first type of such compounds,8 whereas pimonidazole PIMO, misonidazole MISO (and its 18F-labeled derivative), and tirapazamine TRPA are molecular bioimaging markers or bioreductive agents (TRPA) useful for the diagnosis and treatment of hypoxic tumors.9­13 In all of them, the presence of the bioreducible NO2/ NO moieties is critical for the diagnostic/therapeutic properties of these agents.

are also highly overexpressed in hypoxic tumors,1­4 as mentioned above, we explore here the possibility of designing bioreductive CA IX/XII inhibitors incorporating such nitroaromatic moieties. For this purpose, we first considered a very simple model compound, namely 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzenesulfonamide 1, which may be reduced (chemically or enzymatically) to the corresponding amino-sulfonamide 2 (Scheme 1). We observed that both 1 and especially 2 act as potent and rather selective inhibitors of CA IX (see discussion later in the text and Table 1). Thus, we envisaged the possible use of such derivatives as bioreductive, hypoxic tumor-selective agents, similarly to the sulfonamide disulfides 3 (which are reduced to the thiols 4), investigated earlier by our group (Scheme 1).7 Thus, considering 1 as lead molecule, a library of previously reported14 2-substituted-5-nitro-benzenesulfonamides (intermediates used for obtaining thromboxane receptor antagonists)14 of types A1-A20 and B1-B3 was investigated for the inhibition of four physiologically relevant CA isozymes, i.e., the cytosolic, house-keeping CA I and II, as well as the

transmembrane, tumor-associated CA IX and XII (Table 1). The main feature of these derivatives is that the 2-substituted-5nitrobenzenesulfonamide scaffold present in the lead 1 was maintained, with the main distinction being that A1-A20 have secondary amines in ortho to the sulfamoyl moiety, whereas derivatives B1-B3 possess tertiary amines in this position. These ortho substituents incorporate aliphatic, linear chain, or cyclic moieties (A1-A6) as well as aromatic (A7-A20) or heterocylic (B1-B3) amines. The nature of these groups was chosen in such a way as to provide a wide insight in SAR for this class of compounds. The analysis of inhibition data presented in Table 1 reveals that against the slow cytosolic isozyme hCA I, the compounds 1, 2, A1-A20, and B1-B3 investigated here behaved as medium potency inhibitors, with inhibition constants in the range of 0.10-12.7 µM. It may be observed that the best CA I inhibitors (submicromolar activity, i.e., KIs of 0.10-027 µM) were 1, A7, and A10. Thus, the lead molecule 1 shows affinity for this isozyme in the same range as the clinically used drug acetazolamide, AZA, or the thiol-sulfonamide 4 investigated earlier.7 The introduction of the phenylamino- (A7) or ptolylamino (A10) moieties in ortho to the sulfamoyl group leads to a slightly better inhibition profile of these two derivatives over the lead 1 (KIs of 0.10 µM for A7 and A10 versus 0.21 µM of 1, respectively), whereas all other substitution patterns present in the remaining derivatives led to a diminished

inhibitory power of the corresponding sulfonamides as compared to the lead 1 (Table 1). Most of these derivatives (including 2, A1, A3, A5, A6, A8, A9, A11-A15, A20, and B1-B3) showed a rather flat SAR, with KIs varying not very much, in the range of 1.8-8.8 µM. These findings demonstrated that both aliphatic amines or aromatic monosubstituted (in ortho and meta) or disubstituted amines are equally ineffective for obtaining strong CA I inhibitors belonging to this class of sulfonamides. The compounds with the lowest affinity for CA I were A2, A4, and A16-A19, which showed KIs in the range of 9.8-12.7 µM. Again, two of these derivatives incorporate aliphatic (acyclic or cyclic) amine moieties in ortho to the sulfamoyl group (A2 and A4), whereas the remaining ones are aromatic or aralkylamines (A16-A19). It should be also noted that the simple amino-derivative 2 is a 29.5 times weaker CA I inhibitor as compared to the corresponding nitroderivative 1. This is probably due to the uncompensated acidifying effect of the nitro group on the sulfonamide moiety because most CAIs bind in deprotonated form, as RSO2NH- anions, to the Zn2+ ion within the enzyme active site.1­7 Against the dominant, physiologically highly relevant isoform hCA II,1 the sulfonamides investigated here showed a very different behavior as compared to what discussed above for hCA

I. Thus, most of these compounds showed good inhibitory power, with KIs in the range of 8.8-506 nM. The best inhibitors were A14, A19, and B2, which with KIs of 8.8-9.3 nM showed the same potency as the clinically used derivatives AZA, MZA, EZA, DRZ, or IND (Table 1). Other derivatives, such as 2, A1, A3-A5, A8-A10, A12, A13, A15, A17, A18, A20, and B1, showed a weaker CA II inhibitory capacity, with KIs in the range of 35.3-98 nM, with most of these compounds showing the same type of activity against CA II as the clinically used drug dichlorophenamide DCP (Table 1).1,19 They incorporate both secondary and tertiary amines functionalized with both aliphatic and aromatic groups, similarly to what was mentioned above for the inhibition of CA I. A last group of sulfonamides, i.e., 1, A2, A6, A7, A11, A16, and B3, showed a weaker CA II inhibitory capacity as compared to the compounds discussed above, with KIs in the range of 100-506 nM (Table 1). From the analysis of these data, it may be observed that even very small alterations in the structure of these compounds lead to a drastic change in the CA II inhibitory capacity. For example the replacement of an oxygen atom in B2 by a corresponding CH2 group in B1 leads to a 5.5 times worse CA II inhibitor. Furthermore, an additional CH2 moiety, as in B3, is even more detrimental to the biological activity, the compound being an inhibitor 12.8 times less effective as compared to B2 and a 2.3

times as compared to B1. Another example is offered by A14 and A16, the most effective and the least effective CA II inhibitor in this series, whose only difference consists in the positions of the two methyl groups substituting the aniline functionality in ortho to the sulfamoyl group. These data are in agreement with previously reported studies on other sulfonamides/sulfamates/sulfamides possessing CA inhibitory properties and have been explained at the molecular level by reporting the X-ray crystal structures of such adducts with CA II.16­18 These structures evidencing clashes between certain moieties of the inhibitor and amino acid residues within the enzyme active site (in addition to favorable interactions that allow the complexation of the inhibitor within the cavity) can explain why even a minor structural difference between two compounds, e.g., an additional CH2 moiety, may lead to very different inhibitory effects against various CA isozymes.16­18 Finally, it is also worth noting the finding that amine 2 is in this case a much more effective inhibitor as compared to the corresponding nitro-derivative 1, proving that the pKa alone is not a sufficiently important factor to influence the inhibitory capacity (as stressed above, just the reverse situation was true for the inhibition of isoform CA I, against which 1 was a much stronger inhibitor than 2). Against the tumor-associated isoform CA IX, the sulfonamides investigated here showed a very interesting inhibitory activity. Thus, three compounds, A6, A16, and B3, were moderate inhibitors, with KIs in the range of 93-289 nM, whereas the other five derivatives were slightly better inhibitors (i.e., 1, 2, A5, A12, and A15 showing KIs in the range of 33.4-85 nM, Table 1). However, compounds A1-A4, A7-A11, A13, A14, A17-A20, and B1, B2 behaved as very potent CA IX inhibitors, with KIs in the range of 7.4-14 nM, being generally more effective than the clinically used derivatives AZA-IND. Again, SAR is rather flat for this series of compounds, as discussed above for CA I and II. In fact, the best inhibitors incorporate both aliphatic as well as aromatic, secondary, or tertiary amine moieties in ortho to the sulfamoyl group. As for CA II, the amino derivative 2 was almost a two times more effective CA IX inhibitor as compared to the corresponding nitroderivative 1, which for a potentially bioreducible compound is an important observation (Table 1). CA XII was well inhibited by most derivatives investigated here, similarly to CA IX. In fact, we have shown earlier23 that CA XII is a sulfonamide-avid isoform, being strongly inhibited by many types of sulfonamides, including the clinically used derivatives AZA-IND23 (see also Table 1). Thus, only A6 and A16 were weaker CA XII inhibitors (KIs of 175-246 nM), all other compounds showing a very potent inhibitory activity, with KIs in the range of 5.8-79 nM. The findings reported here show that many of the sulfonamides investigated here act as CA IX/XII selective inhibitors, possessing a higher affinity for the tumor-associated over the cytosolic isozymes CA I and II (Table 2). Generally, the selectivity ratio toward CA I is not a problem because this isozyme is known to have a lower affinity for sulfonamide CAIs, as compared to CA II, due to the presence of several bulky amino acid residues (such as His200 and His67 among others) within the active site.1,2,18 Indeed, the selectivity ratios for the inhibition of both hCA IX and hCA XII over hCA I are very good, in the ranges of 162.3-1391 (hCA I/hCA IX), and 11.7-1395 (hCA I/hCA XII), respectively (Table 2). However, the inhibition profiles of CA II and IX (or CA II and XII) are generally much more similar. It is difficult to obtain compounds with a better affinity for the tumor-associated isozymes over

CA II (for example, all the clinically used inhibitors have selectivity ratios for the inhibition of CA II over CA IX < 1, see Table 2).1­3 Data of Table 2 show that the nitro-sulfonamides investigated here are better CA IX inhibitors than CA II inhibitors, with selectivity ratios in the range of 1.54-12.4. The selectivity ratios for the inhibition of CA XII over CA II are even higher, being in the range of 4.27-16.9. These data clearly demonstrate that the class of sulfonamides investigated here shows some significant levels of selectivity for the inhibition of the tumor-associated isozymes CA IX and XII over the cytosolic, house-keeping isozymes CA I and II. This is indeed a very important result, which can be used to find a rationale in the drug design of selective CA inhibitors. In the literature, a series of amino acids located in the active site was reported to be involved in inhibitor recognition and to have a role in the selectivity of various inhibitors toward different isozymes.6,17,20­22 In particular, the amino acid in position 131, which is Phe for hCA II, Leu for hCA I, Val for hCA IX, and Ala for hCA XII (see Figure 1),1­3 is known to be very important for the binding of sulfonamide inhibitors to CAs.6 As an example, in the case of hCA II, the bulky side chain of this Phe residue limits the space available for the inhibitors, or it may participate in stacking interactions with aromatic groups. The presence of a less bulky such residue in hCA IX (i.e., a valine) has as a consequence the fact that the hCA IX active site is larger than that of hCA II and can accommodate bulkier inhibitors. (for recent examples, see refs 20, 21). The presence of a less bulky such residue in hCA IX (i.e., a valine), which is also unavailable for participation to stacking interactions, has as a consequence the fact that the hCA IX active site is larger than that of hCA II. A second residue that drew our attention is 132, which is Gly in hCA II, Ala in hCA I, Asp in hCA IX, and Ser in hCA XII (Figure 1). This residue is situated on the rim of the active site cavity of hCA II (and presumably also of hCA IX, for which the X-ray crystal structure has not yet been reported)1­3 and it is critical for the interaction with inhibitors possessing elongated molecules, as recently shown by our group.22 Strong hydrogen bonds involving the CONH moiety of Gly132 were shown to stabilize the complex of this isozyme with a p-aminoethylbenzenesulfonamide derived inhibitor.22 In the case of hCA IX, the presence of aspartic acid in this position at the entrance of the active site may signify that: (i) stronger interactions with polar moieties of the inhibitor should be possible, (ii) this residue may have flexible conformations, fine-tuning in this way the interaction with inhibitors. Finally, the residue in position 65, which is Ala for hCA II and Ser for hCA I, hCA IX ,and hCA

XII, has also been reported to have an important role in discriminating inhibitor binding affinity toward different isozymes.17 Because a careful comparison between the amino acid sequences of the isozymes I, II, IX, and XII reveals several other important amino acid substitutions within their active sites (see Figure 1), we have undertaken a crystallographic and molecular modeling study to identify which residues could be responsible for the selectivity properties toward the different CA isozymes of the class of molecules here investigated. X-Ray Crystallography. The structure of the isozyme hCA II with the lead compound 1 has been solved. In particular, this compound was chosen because it presents a 2-substituted-5nitrobenzenesulfonamide scaffold that is common to all the other molecules investigated here; thus structural determinants responsible of its binding properties can be easily extended to all other members of this inhibitor family. The hCA II-1 complex was prepared and crystallized using experimental conditions previously reported for other sulfonamide CA inhibitors and the structure was solved using the difference Fourier method, with the structure of the native hCA II as starting model.24 The crystallographic R-factor and R-free, calculated in the 20.00-1.45 Å resolution range, were 0.192 and 0.207, respectively; the statistics for data collection and refinement are shown in Table 3. Analysis of the electron density maps of the hCA II-1 complex clearly showed the presence of one inhibitor molecule in the enzyme catalytic site, with an entirely defined electron density (Figure 2). The topology of the inhibitor binding within the active site is shown in Figure 3. In particular, the sulfonamide group of 1 was coordinated to the Zn(II) ion within the hCA II cavity, with other residues participating to the stabilization of the E-I complex, similarly to what observed for the same moiety in other inhibitors for which the structure has been solved in complex with the enzyme (Figure 3).5­7,16­22 Moreover, the phenyl ring of 1 established strong Van der Waals contacts with residues Gln92, His94, Val121, Phe131, Leu198,

and Thr200. Its chlorine atom also interacted with the aliphatic side chain of various hydrophobic residues (Val121, Leu141, Val 143, Leu198, and Val207). The NO2 group of the inhibitor, whose plane was oriented perpendicularly to that of the phenyl ring, was directed toward the hydrophilic side of the active site cleft, establishing hydrogen bonds with residues His64 and Thr200 and with two water molecules (Figure 3). Around this NO2 group, a weak electron density was observed that seemed to suggest the presence of a second conformation for this moiety,

whose plane was planar with respect to that of the phenyl ring (data not shown). A careful analysis of the hCA II-1 complex structure revealed that the phenyl ring of the inhibitor was oriented in the enzyme active site differently from that observed in other hCA II-benzenesulfonamides complexes (Figure 4).19 Thus, the plane of the phenyl ring appeared rotated by almost 45° and tilted by approximately 10° with respect to the canonical orientation5­7 as a result of the interaction of the NO2 group with Thr200 and His64 (Figure 4). Recently, this conformation was also observed for benzene-1,3-disulfonamides containing derivatives, such as DCP,19 being ascribed, also in this case, to the presence of a rather bulky meta-substitutent relative to the sulfamoyl zinc-binding function within the inhibitor molecule, able to establish polar interactions with hCA II residues delimiting the hydrophilic part of the active site (Figure 4). Modeling Studies and Molecular Dynamics Simulations. To identify the molecular features responsible for the differences observed in the affinity of 1 toward hCA II and hCA IX (Table 1), a model of the hCA IX-1 complex was built up by homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. The main protein-inhibitor interactions evidenced using this procedure are schematically depicted in Figure 5. A comparison of this model with the crystallographic structure of the hCA II-1 complex revealed important differences in the

binding mode of this inhibitor to the two isoforms. In particular, whereas the tetrahedral geometry of the Zn2+ binding site and the key hydrogen bonds between the sulfonamide moiety of the inhibitor and enzyme active site were all retained in both complexes, the pattern of hydrogen bonds involving the hCA IX enzyme and the oxygens of inhibitor NO2 group, even if conserved with respect to hCA II-1 complex, was enriched by an additional interaction. Thus, Asn67 present in the hCA II active site is replaced in hCA IX by Gln67, which, as a consequence of its longer side chain, is able to form a stable hydrogen bond with the inhibitor NO2 oxygen atoms. In addition, the interaction of His64 with the inhibitor is further optimized by the formation of another hydrogen bond between its ND2 atom and the hydroxyl group of Ser65, which in hCA IX replaces Ala65 present in hCA II. In conclusion, a rather

3236 Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2008, Vol. 51, No. 11

Ambrosio et al.

different pattern of polar interactions within the enzyme active site, caused by specific amino acid substitutions, might explain the 2.77-fold higher inhibition efficiency of compound 1 toward hCA IX with respect to hCA II. Conclusions A large series of 2-substituted-5-nitro-benzenesulfonamides, incorporating a large variety of secondary/tertiary amines in ortho to the sulfamoyl moiety, were explored as inhibitors of several physiologically/pathologically relevant CA isozymes with the aim of designing bioreducible inhibitors targeting the hypoxia overexpressed, tumor-associated isozymes CA IX/XII. The investigated compounds were ineffective inhibitors of the cytosolic isoform CA I (in the micromolar range), showed a better inhibition of the physiologically relevant, house-keeping isoform CA II (KIs of 8.8-4975 nM), but strongly inhibited the tumor-associated CA IX and XII (KIs of 7.4-653 nM against CA IX, and 5.8-175 nM against CA XII, respectively). Some of these compounds showed excellent selectivity ratios (in the range of 10-1395) for the inhibition of the tumor associated over the cytosolic isozymes. The X-ray crystal structure of the adduct of hCA II with the lead molecule 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzenesulfonamide as well as molecular modeling studies for its interaction with hCA IX afforded a better understanding of the factors governing the discrimination of the two isoforms for this type of bioreductive compounds targeting specifically hypoxic tumors. Experimental Section
The hCA II-1 complex was obtained by adding a 3-molar excess of inhibitors to a 10 mg/mL protein solution in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Crystals of the complex were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. In particular, 2 µL of complex solution were mixed with 2 µL of precipitant solution (2.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.3 M NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), and 5 mM 4-(hydroxymercurybenzoic) acid) and suspended over a reservoir containing 1 mL of precipitant solution at 22 °C. Crystals grew within a few days and were isomorphous to those of the native enzyme.24 X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K, at the Synchrotron source Elettra in Trieste, using a Mar CCD detector. Prior to cryogenic freezing, the crystals were transferred to the precipitant solution with the addition of 15% (v/v) glycerol. Diffracted data were processed using the HKL crystallographic data reduction package.25 Diffraction data were indexed in the P21 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Unit cell parameters and data reduction statistics are summarized in Table 3. The enzyme-inhibitor complex structure was analyzed by difference Fourier techniques, using the atomic coordinates of the native hCA II (PDB entry 1CA2)24 as starting model. The refinement was carried out with the program CNS,26 whereas the model building and map inspections were performed using the O program.27 Fourier maps calculated with |3Fo - 2Fc| and |Fo Fc| coefficients showed prominent electron density features in the active site region. After initial refinement limited to the enzyme, the inhibitor molecule was gradually built into the model for further refinement. Restraints on inhibitor bond angles and distances were taken from similar structures in the Cambridge Structural Database, and standard restraints were used on protein bond angles and distances throughout refinement. The ordered water molecules were added automatically and checked individually. Each peak contoured at 3 in the |Fo - Fc| maps was identified as a water molecule, provided that hydrogen bonds would be allowed between this site and the model. The correctness of stereochemistry was finally checked using PROCHECK.28 Final refinement statistics are reported in Table 3. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2QP6). Modeling Studies and Molecular Dynamics Simulations. A model of the hCA IX catalytic domain (G12-F260) was built as

previously reported by Alterio et al.5 Briefly, the sequence of hCA IX was retrieved from publicly available sequence database SwissProt/TrEMBL (primary accession number Q16790)29 and was modeled using both hCA II (34% sequence identity) and hCA XIV (34% sequence identity) (PDB entry 1RJ6)30 X-ray structures as templates. Fifty homology models were built with MODELER version 6.2,31 and their quality was assessed by using PROCHECK28 and 3D-profile module32 of INSIGHT II (Accelrys Software Inc.). The best model in term of PROCHECK G-factor and 3D-profile score was then complexed to the inhibitor by superimposing the heavy atoms from the three Zn2+ coordination histidines of hCA II-1 structure to corresponding atoms of hCA IX model. The hCA IX-1 complex was completed by addition of all hydrogen atoms and underwent energy minimization with the SANDER module of AMBER9 package33 using the PARM99 force field.34 Atomic charges of 1 were obtained with the RESP methodology.35 The conformation of 1 derived from the hCA II-1 crystal structure was fully optimized using the GAMESS program36 at the Hartree-Fock level with STO-3G basis set. Single-point calculations on optimized molecule were performed at the RHF/ 6-31G* level. The resulting electrostatic potential was thus used for a one-stage single-conformation RESP charge fitting. Partial charges for the three histidines and the zinc ion were those published by Suarez and Merz.37 To preserve the integral charge of the whole system, partial charges of CR and HR atoms of the zinc-ligand residues and of the N and H atoms belonging to the inhibitor sulfonamide group were modified accordingly. A bonded approach between Zn2+ ion and its ligands ensured the experimentally observed tetrahedral Zn2+ coordination in all complexes during the MD simulations. Equilibrium bond distances and angles were taken from the hCA II crystal structure.24 Force constant values of 120, 20,and30kcalmol-1 Å-1 wereusedforN(His)-Zn,N(His)-Zn-N(His) and N(His)-Zn-N(sulfonamide) bond stretching and angle bending parameters, respectively. All the torsional parameters associated with Zn-ligand interactions were set to zero according to Hoops et al.38 To perform the MD simulation in the presence of solvent, the minimized complexes were confined in truncated octahedron boxes (x, y, z ) 80 Å) filled with TIP3P water molecules and counterions (Na+) to neutralize the system. The solvated molecules were then energy minimized through 1000 steps with solute atoms restrained to their starting positions by using a force constant of 10 kcal mol-1 Å-1 prior to the MD simulations. After this, the molecules were submitted to 90 ps restrained MD (5 kcal mol-1 Å-1) at constant volume, gradually heating to 300 K, followed by 60 ps restrained MD (5 kcal mol-1 Å-1) at constant pressure to adjust the system density. Production MD simulations were carried out at 300 K and a constant pressure for 1 ns with a time-step of 1.5 fs. Bonds involving hydrogens were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm.39 Snapshots from production run were saved every 1000 steps and analyzed with MOLMOL program.40
