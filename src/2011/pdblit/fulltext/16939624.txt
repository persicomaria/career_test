The vertex of the adenoviral capsid is formed by the penton, a complex of two proteins, the pentameric penton base and the trimeric fiber protein. The penton contains all necessary components for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. After initial attachment via the head domain of the fiber protein, the penton base interacts with cellular integrins through an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif located in a hypervariable surface loop, triggering virus internalization. In order to investigate the structural and functional role of this region, we replaced the hypervariable loop of serotype 2 with the corresponding, but much shorter, loop of serotype 12 and com° pared it to the wild type. Here, we report the 3.6 A crystal structure of a human adenovirus 2 / 12 penton base chimera crystallized as a dodecamer. The structure is generally similar to human adenovirus 2 penton base, with the main differences localized to the fiber protein-binding site. Fluorescence anisotropy assays using a trimeric fiber protein mimetic called the minifiber and wild-type human adenovirus 2 and chimeric penton base demonstrate that fiber protein binding is independent of the hypervariable loop, with a Kd for fiber binding estimated in the 1­2 lm range. Interestingly, competition assays using labeled and unlabeled minifiber demonstrated virtually irreversible binding to the penton base, which we ascribe to a conformational change, on the basis of comparisons of all available penton base structures.

Adenoviruses are nonenveloped double-stranded DNA viruses found in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. Human adenoviruses are divided into six subgroups (A­F) based on genetic organization, hemagluttination patterns, immuno-crossreactivity, and nucleotide content. Over 50 serotypes have been identified in humans; these cause generally mild respiratory, enteric and ocular disease. However, in immunocompromised, very young, or elderly individuals, adenoviral infections can lead to serious illness or death [1,2]. Apart from their role as a common human pathogen, adenoviruses are one of the most studied vectors for

gene delivery due to extensive knowledge of their biology and the ability to manipulate the adenoviral genome [3­5]. The adenoviral T ¼ 25 icosahedral capsid consists of three major polypeptides: the trimeric hexon, which forms the facets of the particle, the pentameric penton base (pb), which forms the vertices, and the trimeric fiber protein, which extends from the penton base at the vertex positions. Additionally, cementing proteins such as IIIa, VI, VIII and IX help stabilize the capsid, reinforcing the penton­hexon and hexon­hexon interactions. The capsid contains 720 copies of the hexon

and 60 copies of the penton base monomers. In addition to its role as a critical component of the viral capsid, the penton base also contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif that acts as a trigger for endocytosis of the adenovirus into the host cell. Furthermore, the architecture of the entire virus, including the positions of the cementing proteins, has been revealed in detail by recent high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions [6­11]. Initial cell attachment occurs via interactions of the fiber protein C-terminal head domain. For the majority of serotypes, including adenoviruses 2 and 12, the Coxsackie- and adenovirus receptor (CAR), an integral membrane protein, shown to be a component of the tight junction in epithelial cells [12], is the primary cellular receptor. Upon virus attachment, the RGD motif of the penton base binds to aVb3, aVb5, or aVb1 integrin, which acts as a secondary receptor [13­15]. This interaction of the RGD motif with the host cell causes clustering of integrins and activates a signaling cascade, allowing viral entry into clathrin-coated pits and endosomes [14,16]. It is thought that upon integrin binding and before endocytosis, the fiber protein is shed from the virus [13,17­19]. One hypothesis for the mechanism of fiber removal from the virus involves a conformational change triggered by the penton base binding to integrin. The process by which integrin binding may be coupled to structural changes in the penton base, allowing fiber release, is not clear, but could involve changes in the hypervariable loop upon integrin binding being communicated to the fiber-binding region of the penton base. Although the adenovirus penton base exhibits a high degree of sequence homology (typically over 70% homology between different subgroups of human adenoviruses), the RGD motif is located in a hypervariable loop region of the penton base protein. This region can vary in length from approximately eight residues in human adenovirus serotype 12 (hAd12) to over 70 residues in human adenovirus 2 (hAd2). Previous crystallographic studies of the hAd2 penton base revealed this region to be very flexible, with the hypervariable loop almost completely disordered. At a unique crystal contact, a helix turn from the hypervariable loop was identified; however, the amino acid sequence could not be definitively assigned [20]. Cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of adenovirus 2 [21] with an RGD-recognizing antibody and with a soluble aVb5 integrin [16] show only diffuse density for the hypervariable loop region; however, the resolution ° was limited to $ 21 A. In contrast, cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of complexes with soluble integrin and hAd12 gave more defined density in the

region of the RGD motif due to the better order of the shorter hypervariable loop in this serotype [16]. Higher-resolution cryoelectron microscopy reconstruc° tions (12 A) of dodecahedral penton and penton base particles formed by the hAd3 serotype revealed additional density in the region of the hypervariable loop, implying some favored conformations of the region [22]. The electron microscopy data for serotypes hAd3 and hAd12 and the crystallographic data for hAd2 raise the possibility that the hypervariable loop could possess secondary structural elements potentially important for integrin recognition or binding. We constructed an hAd2pb / 12pb chimera by replacing the long hypervariable loop ($ 73 residues) of hAd2pb with the short hypervariable loop ($ 8 residues) of hAd12pb. Note that the sequence identity between hAd2 and hAd12 penton bases outside the hypervariable region is approximately 78%. We hypothesized that the shorter hypervariable loop of hAd12 would be more structured relative to the longer hAd2 hypervariable loop and allow for crystallographic characterization of this region of the penton base. Additionally, the chimeric construct would enable us to assess its possible role in the binding of the fiber protein in serotypes such as hAd2, which contain a long hypervariable region. The long hypervariable loop could directly interact with the fiber protein, but the shorter hAd12 hypervariable loop would be unable to reach the fiber protein-binding site. Thus, by dramatically shortening the hypervariable loop to the hAd12 sequence, we eliminated any possible direct interactions between the hypervariable loop of the penton base and the fiber protein. We present here the ° 3.6 A crystal structure of an hAd2pb / 12pb chimera and fluorescence anisotropy binding data of the wild type and the chimeric construct with a fiber protein mimetic.

Results and Discussion
The 73-residue hypervariable loop of hAd2pb was replaced with the eight-residue hypervariable loop from hAd12 (Fig. 1). Owing to the proteolytic sensitivity of the construct, a more stable N-terminally truncated (49-TGGR ...) version was designed. All structural studies presented here used the ) 49 N-terminally truncated hAd2pb / 12pb chimera. Analogous to the hAd2 penton base, the hAd2 / 12 chimeric construct formed well-behaved pentamers in solution, as confirmed by gel filtration and negativestain electron microscopy (data not shown). As with hAd2pb, the solvent environment has marked effects on the equilibrium between pentamer and dodecamer

(regular arrangements of 12 pentamers), and the chimera formed dodecahedral particles under crystallization conditions. These crystallization conditions were, however, different from those for hAd2. For hAd2pb, high concentrations of ammonium sulfate (1.6 m) and dioxane (10%) were necessary for dodecahedra formation [20], whereas hAd2 / 12pb crystallized in the dodecahedral form in high (50% v / v) 2-methyl-2,4pentane diol (MPD) solvent conditions. The ionic strength of the solvent environment and / or presence of small organic compounds (dioxane and MPD) seems to favor formation of dodecahedra over isolated pentamers. Previous structural analysis of the residues at the penton­penton interface of the hAd2pb dodecahedron showed that there is no obvious pattern characterizing the penton bases of those serotypes which do or do not form dodecahedra during adenoviral infection [20]. Indeed, we suspect that all penton bases are capable of forming dodecahedra, depending on two factors: first, the solvent conditions affecting the dodecamer­pentamer equilibrium, and second, proteolysis or truncation of the penton base N-terminus. It has recently been shown that formation of hAd3 dodecahedra is favored by truncation of the N-terminal region [16], and crystals of the hAd2 and hAd2 / 12 chimera dodecahedra were obtained with protein N-terminally truncated by 49 residues [19]. The structure shows that the truncated N-terminus of
4338

the protein faces the interior of the particle, and small solvent channels between pentamers are not extensive enough to provide egress for the N-termini from the particle while retaining the dodecahedral structure. Calculations of the interior volume of the dodeca° hedral particle based on a cavity radius of 40 A in hAd2 / 12pb and hAd2pb give a volume of ° $ 300 000 A3, too small to accommodate an extra 2940 residues corresponding to the N-terminal extension from the 60 copies of the full-length protein. The formation of small subviral particles by truncated viral capsid proteins is not limited to adenovirus. For example, this phenomenon of spontaneous assembly into regular particles has been noted for recombinant human papilloma virus L1 protein, a pentameric capsid protein. Only upon a 10-residue N-terminal truncation does the L1 protein form small virus-like particles of icosahedral symmetry [23]. The physiologic role, if any, of penton base dodecamer formation in infected cells has not been defined for adenovirus. However, the N-terminal extremity of the penton base contains two PPxY motifs, shown to interact with the WW domains of cellular ubiquitin ligases [24,25]. As these motifs are presumably important for adenovirus infection, it would be undesirable to incorporate truncated penton bases into virions, and dodecahedron formation could be a mechanism to avoid this.

ric unit, but exhibited a similar packing arrangement to the chimeric protein [20]. The structure was phased by molecular replacement using the hAd2pb pentamer as a model and searching for three copies in the asymmetric unit. Initial maps were improved by rigid body refinement followed by 15-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging (NCS) of the electron density. Owing to the high degree of NCS, the electron density maps were of high quality and readily interpretable. The hAd2 / 12pb forms a stable pentamer under physiologic conditions. Pentamer formation involves contacts throughout the polypeptide chain and hides a large amount of the hydrophobic surface area. Surface area calculations for the pentamer give a total surface ° ° area of $ 81 000 A2 with 30% ($ 24 000 A2) as contact area. Thus, a large amount of the available surface area of the molecule is buried upon pentamerization, increasing the stability of the protein. The hAd2 / 12 penton base monomer can be divided into a basal jellyroll domain formed by two b-sheets and a distal domain formed by insertions between the strands of the jellyroll domain (Fig. 3). Antiparallel b-sheets made up of strands CHEF and BIDG pack against each other, forming the jellyroll topology, a typical viral capsid protein fold [26]. The distal domain is formed by an insertion of $ 230 residues (residues 133­367) between strands D and E and a smaller insertion of $ 50 residues (residues 404­458) between strands F and G.

containing the RGD motif, is located at the top of the distal domain within the first insertion, and faces the solvent-exposed exterior of the particle. As in the hAd2pb structures, even the shorter Ad12 hypervariable loop is highly flexible, as demonstrated by relatively poor electron density and high temperature factors. In all monomers, residues 297­317 were disordered and not modeled. The second insertion into the jellyroll domain contains part of the putative fiber protein-binding site. This portion of the protein undergoes a conformational change upon fiber protein binding, with helix 7 kinking almost 45° to form a binding cleft for the N-terminus of the fiber protein [20].

fiber peptide bound and unbound structures reveal a high degree of overall conservation (Figs 3B and 4). Surprisingly, the hAd2 / 12pb structure most closely resembles the fiber peptide-bound form of hAd2pb; however, no fiber peptide was present during crystallization, and the fiber-binding site is empty. A possible explanation for the observed conformation of helix 7 is the effect of the solvent environment, specifically high concentrations (50%) of MPD, favoring a conformation mimicking the fiber protein-bound state. HAd2pb and the hAd2pb / fiber peptide complex were both crystallized from ammonium sulfate / dioxane solutions, not MPD solutions [20]. The use of high concentrations of a small organic alcohol will affect the solvent structure of the protein. Studies quantifying the effects of MPD on protein structure have demonstrated that the alcohol tends to bind in hydrophobic sites, particularly at leucine side chains [27]. The fiber

protein-binding site consists primarily of hydrophobic residues, including Leu193. It is possible that these hydrophobic interactions lead to a conformational ° change of helix 7. Although the modest 3.6 A resolution of the hAd2 / 12pb crystal structure precludes the location of any ordered MPD molecules within the fiber protein-binding site, this is a likely possibility. A second hypothesis for the observed conformation of helix 7 entails conformational coupling of the hypervariable loop to the fiber protein-binding region. It has been shown that the fiber protein is shed from the virus upon integrin binding by the penton base hypervariable loop and most likely before endocytosis [13,17­19]. Upon addition of soluble RGD peptides that interfere with penton base binding to integrin, the virion exhibited impaired endocytosis. Interestingly, in this experiment, the fibers were not shed from the virus [19]. These data raise the possibility of coupling of fiber release to binding of the RGD motif of the hypervariable loop to cellular integrins. Alterations in hypervariable loop topology, in this case engendered by shortening the loop to the Ad12pb sequence, could have allosteric effects on the fiber-binding site. In order to investigate this possibility, we performed fluorescence-based binding assays of the wild-type hAd2pb and the hAd2 / 12 chimera with a fiber protein mimetic to determine whether fiber binding or fiber release was coupled to changes in the hypervariable loop. Binding assays Owing to difficulties in expressing and purifying the full-length fiber protein, a 75 amino acid `minifiber' construct was used as a fiber protein mimetic. Previous structural studies of hAd2pb with a 22 amino acid peptide from the N-terminus of the fiber protein have mapped the fiber protein interaction region to a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids at the N-terminus of the fiber protein [20]. In order to emulate the oligomerization state of the fiber, a trimerization domain was fused to an N-terminal fiber protein construct (gift of G Nemerow). This construct consists of the first 44 residues of the hAd2 fiber coupled to a trimerizing foldon domain from T-4 bacteriophage fibritin [28] (Fig. 5A). The foldon domain has been shown to induce trimerization in adenovirus fiber protein constructs [29] and was used in the minifiber to mimic the proper oligomerization state of the full-length protein. Proper trimerization of the minifiber construct was confirmed by gel filtration and native gel (data not shown). The minifiber was labeled with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) at C-terminal cysteine residues and purified by size exclusion chromatography.

Derivatization with 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (TMR) was performed on the C-terminal cysteine residue of the minifiber. (B) Left: fluorescence anisotropy measurement for wildtype (wt) (red circles) and hAd2 / 12 (blue squares) with labeled minifiber at 33 nM for all measurements. Varying amounts of penton base were titrated in and plotted against anisotropy. Right: competition assay for labeled versus unlabeled minifiber. The labeled minifiber at 15 nM was preincubated with 3 lM penton base. Unlabeled minfiber was titrated into the solution, and the anisotropy values were recorded. No dissociation of labeled minifiber was noted with the concentrations of minifiber used.

Changes in fluorescence anisotropy were used to directly measure the binding of the TMR-labeled minifiber to the penton base. The initial reaction between the minifiber and the penton base was assumed to be reversible with F þ PB $ PÃ where F is the minifiber, PB the penton base, and P* the initial fiber­penton base complex. Owing to the conformational change of the penton base after fiber binding, the full binding expression can be represented as F þ PB $ PÃ ! P with the formation of P being virtually irreversible. The apparent Kd measured here is the Kd for the initial binding of minifiber. The fluorescence emission of the TMR was assumed to be independent of the binding of the minifiber to the penton base, because it is attached at the C-terminal extremity of the foldon domain and is remote from the penton base-binding region. The system was particularly amenable to this technique, due to the relatively small size of the minifiber ($ 24 kDa for the trimer) in conjunction with the large size of the penton base ($ 300 kDa for the pentamer). Kd values for minifiber binding to wild-type hAd2pb

and chimeric hAd2 / 12pb were 1.0 ± 0.3 lm and 1.85 ± 0.7 lm, respectively (Fig. 5B). During viral assembly, concentrations of the fiber protein within the nucleus of an infected cell are likely to be at least in the low micromolar range, based upon the concentration of virions [30] and excess fiber protein [31] produced during adenoviral infection; thus, the Kd values measured are physiologically reasonable. In order to investigate the role of the proposed conformational change that occurs upon fiber binding, we attempted to dissociate the bound minifiber from the penton base. Previous studies have shown that in vitro removal of the fiber protein from adenovirus requires the use of chaotropic salts and increased temperatures [32,33], and no release of fiber protein has been noted even after long-term storage of dilute solutions of virus [34]. To address these observations, we performed competition experiments using unlabeled minifiber. Unlabeled minifiber was titrated into samples of TMR-labeled minifiber bound to wild-type and chimeric penton base. No decrease in fluorescence anisotropy was observed even upon addition of 50-fold excess of unlabeled minifiber over the calculated Kd (Fig. 5B). These data support the hypothesis that after fiber binding, the conformational change occurring in the penton base locks the fiber protein into place. Thus, as noted previously, a full representation of the binding equilibrium of the interaction is F þ PB $ PÃ ! P where F is the fiber or minifiber protein, PB is the penton base, P* is the initial penton, and P is the penton after conformational change. The stability of the complex results from the effect of the crystallographically observed cooperative conformational change in the fiber protein-binding site. Based on the structure of hAd2pb with an N-terminal fiber peptide, conformational changes will occur in the penton base upon interaction of the fiber protein, essentially locking in the fiber [20]. Studies with adenovirus 2 have shown that fiber loss occurs at the cell surface and prior to endocytosis [19]. Although the mechanism of fiber dissociation from the penton is not clear, the extreme stability of the penton once formed and the relatively weak micromolar affinity for initial complex formation has important implications for adenovirus infectivity. For successful infection, adenovirus needs the fiber protein as a primary points of attachment to the host cell. Studies with fiberless adenoviral particles demonstrated a several thousand-fold decrease in infectivity [35]. Thus, premature loss of the fiber would result in marked decreases in infection. Once the virus is attached to
4342

the cell surface, however, the fiber protein is not necessary for the later steps in the viral cycle. After fiber loss, the low micromolar affinity of the penton base for fiber protein minimizes reattachment of the fiber to the viral particle. The altered conformation of the fiber-binding site in the hAd2 / 12 chimeric structure led us to investigate the possibility of coupling between the conformation of the hypervariable loop, which contains the integrin-binding site, and the fiberbinding site of the penton base. Based on the fluorescence anisotropy data presented here for the wild-type and chimeric protein showing similar binding profiles with relatively weak (1­2 lm) initial affinity of the penton base for the fiber and virtually no release of fiber once bound, adenovirus modulates fiber attachment by a two-step fiber-binding process that is independent of the conformation of the hypervariable loop. The mechanism for fiber release is not coupled to the hypervariable loop size or conformation but may be influenced by the solvent environment of the virion. In this structural study, the fiber-binding site was in a `bound' conformation, although no fiber was present. The most likely explanation for this observation is that the switch from the fiber `bound' to `unbound' states of the penton base (or vice versa) is not only dependent on the presence or absence of the fiber itself but can also be triggered by solvent environment effects. Owing to the cooperativity of this switch [19], all penton bases will be in the same conformation. Triggering the switch to the unbound state would clearly favor fiber release. Our results suggest that this is not dependent on the hypervariable loop directly, but could be due to other interactions with the bound integrin or the particular solvent environment of the virion at the cell surface or in the initial stages of endocytosis.

After 3 days of expression, cells were pelleted at 195 g for 5 min at 4 °C using a Jouan CR3 centrifuge with a T-40 rotor, and stored at ) 80 °C. For protein purification, cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5) / 100 mm NaCl, plus protease inhibitors (Roche) and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was pelleted at 43 000 g for 45 min at 4 °C using an Avanti J-25 centrifuge with a JA25.50 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA), and the supernatant collected. The protein was precipitated with 30% ammonium sulfate and the precipitant collected. After resuspension in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5) / 100 mm NaCl, the protein was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The protein solution was concentrated to $ 5 mgÆmL)1 and applied to a MONO Q column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) with a linear gradient of 100 mm to 1 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The protein eluted at approximately 220 mm NaCl. Fractions of interest were buffer exchanged, concentrated to 5­10 mgÆmL)1 and stored at ) 80 °C. The minifiber construct was cloned into a pEtM11 expression vector between the Kpn1 and Nco1 sites using a forward oligomer 5¢-CTTTATTTTCAGGGCGCCATGAAGCGCG CAAGACCGTCTGAA-3¢ and a reverse oligomer 5¢-AGCT CGAATTCG GATCCGGTACCTCAGAAGGTAGACAG CAGAACC-3¢. For derivitization with TMR, a Gly-Gly-Cys sequence was introduced at the C-terminus using oligomers 5¢-CTGCTGTCTACCTTTGGAGGTTGCTGATCCGAA TTCGAG-3¢ (forward) and 5¢-GCTCGAATTCGGATCAG CAACCTCCAAAGGTAGACAGCA-3¢ (reverse). BL21 cells were transformed with the pETM11 construct and grown until a D of 0.8 (600 nm) in Terrific Broth supplemented with phosphate buffer and kanamycin at 37 °C.

The temperature was reduced to 27 °C and the culture induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Approximately 6 h postinduction, the cells were harvested at 5800 g for 15 min using an Avanti J-25 centrifuge with a JA-10 rotor. Cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5) / 100 mm NaCl / 10 mm b-mercaptoethanol / 1 ·protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed by sonication and cell debris pelleted at 47 000 g using an Avanti J-25 centrifuge with a JA25.50 rotor. The supernatant was collected and applied to a 2 mL Ni-NTA column. The column was washed with lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole and the protein eluted with lysis buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The His tag was cleaved overnight at 4 °C using Tev protease, and the His-tag and Tev were depleted by running the solution over the same Ni-NTA column. The protein was concentrated and applied to an S200 size exclusion column using 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5) / 100 mm NaCl / 10 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. Protein fractions of interest were then concentrated and stored at ) 80 °C.

TMR labeling and binding assays
A five-fold excess of malemide-derivatized TMR was added to a solution of purified minifiber and allowed to react for $ 2 h. Excess TMR was removed by dialysis against 25 mm Tris / 100 mm NaCl, and the protein was concentrated. The labeled protein was then applied to an S75 column for further purification. A standard protocol for fluorescence anisotropy measurements is as follows. Upon excitation at 546 nm, the fluorescence anisotropy of a 33 nm solution of labeled minifiber was measured at an emission wavelength of 575 nm perpendicular to the excitation vector. Either wild-type hAd2pb or hAd2 / 12pb was titrated into the solution in $ 200­300 lm increments. Anisotropy values were recorded for 60 points over 60 s, and an average value was taken as a data point. Titrations were continued until a stable anisotropy value was obtained. Fluorescence anisotropy, A, is defined as A ¼ ðIV À IH Þ=ðIV þ 2IH Þ where IV and IH refer to the parallel and perpendicular components of the polarized fluorescence emission. The changes in anisotropy are a linear function with A ¼ AF þ ðAB À AF Þð½LigB =½Ligtot Þ where A is the measured anisotropy value, AF is the anisotropy of the free minifiber, AB is the anisotropy of the minifiber bound to the penton base, [LigB] is the concentration of the bound ligand (minifiber), and [Ligtot] is the total concentration of the ligand. At any total concentration of ligand, the anisotropy depends on the total concentration of

penton base and the dissociation equilibrium constant for the complex, Kd, as shown by A ¼ AF þ DAðfa À ða2 À ð4½PBtot ½Ligtot ÞÞ1=2 g=2½Ligtot Þ where a ¼ ([PB]tot + [Lig]tot + Kd), DA ¼ (AB ) AF), and [PB] is the concentration of the penton base. Fitting the anisotropy data to the previous equation gives a value for the Kd. Binding curves were generated in kaleidagraph and fitted to the above equation. All measurements were done in triplicate with at least eight data points per experiment.

Crystallization
Crystals were grown in hanging drops against 50% MPD / 0.2 m ammonium phosphate / 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5) at 4 °C. A 1 lL drop of the protein solution at a concentration of 5­10 mgÆmL)1 was added to 1 lL of well solution. Small crystals grew within 2­3 months, reaching dimensions of 50 · 50 · 50 lm. Microseeding of equilibrated drops yielded bigger crystals of dimensions 100 · 100 · 100 lm after a few weeks. Because the high MPD concentration acted as a cryoprotectant, crystals were taken directly from the drop and flash frozen prior to data collection.

ment, tight NCS constraints were only applied to the backbone, and the side chains were refined using medium restraints. Unaveraged maps were examined to locate deviations between monomers. According to procheck [41] (Table 1), only three (Thr66, Glu172, and His237) residues were in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. These generally lie in poorly ordered loop regions. Residues 507­508 (C-terminus) and residues 297­317 of the hypervariable loop were disordered and not modeled. All figures were generated using pymol [42]. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under accession code 2C6S.

Data collection and structure determination
Crystallographic data for hAd2 / 12pb were collected on the microfocus ESRF beamline ID13 with the EMBL microdiffractometer (Maatel, Voreppe, France) [36]. Owing to the large unit cell, an oscillation range of 0.5° was used during data collection. Radiation damage was readily apparent after a few exposures, which limited the amount of usable data per exposed position to 2° (four 0.5° frames). Owing to the small beam size used (10 lm), the crystal was repositioned after each 2°, permitting data collection from an undamaged volume of crystal. Two large crystals (100 · 100 · 100 lm3) provided 104 frames (52°) and 128 frames (64°) of usable data to a maximum resolution of ° $ 3.5 A. A direct beam was taken in order to have a highly precise value for the beam center. The beam center was found and refined in mosflm [37]. All data were integrated and scaled with xds. molrep [38] was used to find a molecular replacement solution with the hAd2 pentamer as a search model (pdb code 1X9P). Based on the unit cell dimensions and Matthews coefficient, three pentamers were expected per asymmetric unit, with the full dodecahedral particle formed from the space group symmetry operators. A clear solution with three pentamers was found and used to generate initial maps. Subsequent 15-fold NCS averaging and gradual ° ° phase extension from 15 A to 3.6 A with rave [39] allowed the generation of high-quality electron density maps. Model building was performed in o [40] and refinements carried out with refmac. Initially, strict NCS restraints were applied to the model; however, in the later stages of refine-
