Structural Insights into the Functional Interaction of KChIP1 with Shal-Type K Channels
Wei Zhou,1,2 Yan Qian,3 Kumud Kunjilwar,3 Paul J. Pfaffinger,3,* and Senyon Choe1,2,* 1 Structural Biology Laboratory The Salk Institute La Jolla, California 92037 2 Division of Biological Science University of California, San Diego La Jolla, California 92093 3 Division of Neuroscience Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas 77030 the extended depolarization due to their fast inactivation property (Baldwin et al., 1991; Kuo et al., 2001; Malin and Nerbonne, 2001; Zhu et al., 1999). This sharp temporal opening of Kv4 channels is essential in controlling action potential firing rate, preventing the back propagation of action potentials into neuronal dendrites and regulating repolarization phase of action potentials of cardiomyocytes (Hoffman et al., 1997). A particularly interesting family of Kv4-specific auxiliary proteins are the Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs) (An et al., 2000). KChIPs belong to the calcium binding neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of EF-hand proteins (Berridge et al., 2000; Braunewell and Gundelfinger, 1999; Burgoyne and Weiss, 2001). Four KChIPs (KChIP1 through KChIP4) have been identified with different tissue distributions and alternative splicing variants. KChIP1 and KChIP4 are mainly found in brain, KChIP2 in heart, brain, and lung, and KChIP3 in brain and at a lower level in testis. Other members of the NCS protein family include recoverin, frequenin (also called NCS-1), visinin-like proteins (VILIPs: VILIP-1, VILIP-2, VILIP-3, neurocalcin, hippocalcin), and guanylyl cyclase activating protein (GCAP). NCS homologs are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human and are involved in regulating many cellular processes such as visual signal transduction, neurotransmitter release, gene transcription, and ion channel modulation. NCS proteins can be distinguished from the common Ca2 binding signaling molecule, calmodulin, based on the primary sequence similarity and tertiary structural homology. In higher organisms, KChIPs and frequenin have been implicated in the direct modulation of Kv4 channel's cell surface expression, gating, and regulation by protein kinases, through interactions with the first 40 amino acids of Kv4 channels (An et al., 2000; Bahring et al., 2001; Guo et al., 2002; Holmqvist et al., 2002; Li and Adelman, 2000; Morohashi et al., 2002; Nakamura et al., 2001; Schrader et al., 2002). Even though the association of KChIPs with Kv4 channels may be Ca2 independent, the modulatory functions of KChIPs are dependent on Ca2 (An et al., 2000). It is not well understood how the complex Ca2 signal is coupled with KChIP's activity in neuron and in heart. Among four KChIPs, the multifunctional KChIP3, also known as the transcription factor DREAM and calsenilin, regulates the transcription of prodynorphin and interacts with presenilin, respectively, in a Ca2 -dependent manner (Buxbaum et al., 1998; Carrion et al., 1999). A common structural feature of NCS proteins is that they all have a 4 EF-hand scaffold that undergoes conformational changes in a Ca2 -dependent manner. The four EF-hands work in pairs such that EF-1 and EF-2 form the N lobe and EF-3 and EF-4 form the C lobe. In addition to the eight helices involved in forming the four EF-hands, all NCS proteins have a N-terminal helix (H1) and a C-terminal helix (H10) that flank the EFhands domain. Preceding H1 is an N-terminal variable region that varies among different splicing variants of KChIPs (Figure 1A; Patel et al., 2002; Takimoto et al., 2002). This N-terminal variable segment has been implicated in myristoylation that is important for the mem-

Summary Four Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIP1 through KChIP4) interact directly with the N-terminal domain of three Shal-type voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3) to modulate cell surface expression and function of Kv4 channels. Here we report ° a 2.0 A crystal structure of the core domain of KChIP1 (KChIP1*) in complex with the N-terminal fragment of Kv4.2 (Kv4.2N30). The complex reveals a clam-shaped dimeric assembly. Four EF-hands from each KChIP1 form each shell of the clam. The N-terminal end of Kv4.2 forming an helix ( 1) and the C-terminal helix (H10) of KChIP1 are enclosed nearly coaxially by these shells. As a result, the H10 of KChIP1 and 1 of Kv4.2 mediate interactions between these two molecules, structurally reminiscent of the interactions between calmodulin and its target peptides. Site-specific mutagenesis combined with functional characterization shows that those interactions mediated by 1 and H10 are essential to the modulation of Kv4.2 by KChIPs. Introduction Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels play important roles in regulating the excitability of myocytes and neurons. Functional Kv channels are composed of multiple subunits, including a tetrameric core of pore-forming subunits with a variable number of additional auxiliary subunits. The structural framework of the tetrameric pore assembly of the subunit is universally conserved (Jiang et al., 2003), but the interactions of auxiliary subunits with subunits can change many of the functional properties of the Kv channels at the membrane surface as well as their intracellular trafficking and turnover rates. Kv channel subunits are divided into four major subfamilies (Kv1 through Kv4) based on sequence conservation and distinct functional interactions. In this study, we have focused on the modulation of the Kv4 (Shal) subfamily of Kv channels. The Kv4 channels generate A-type potassium current (also called Ito) that rises very rapidly, then quickly shuts down during

brane localization of NCS proteins (Ames et al., 1997; Takimoto et al., 2002). However, the N-terminal variable segment itself from KChIPs is not required to modulate channel activity (An et al., 2000). For simplicity in nomenclature, we will refer to the core domain of KChIP1, lacking the N-terminal variable domain, as KChIP1*. We report here the crystal structure of a fusion complex of KChIP1* with the first N-terminal 30 amino acids ° of Kv4.2 (Kv4.2N30) at 2 A resolution. It reveals that the first 20 residues of Kv4.2 form an helix ( 1) that is colinear with the C-terminal helix (H10) of KChIP1 in a head-to-tail fashion. A pair of these two helices are deeply buried inside a hydrophobic groove formed between two shells of a KChIP1* dimer. These two helices mediate the major interface between the two proteins and contribute to the stability of the dimer. As the first NCS-ligand complex structure, this interaction reveals novel specificity-encoding determinants used to differentiate NCS-ligand interactions. By site-specific mutagenesis at this interface, we demonstrate that the hydrophobic interactions are essential for the modulation of Kv4 channels by KChIPs. Furthermore, the mode of interaction between KChIPs and Kv4 channels shows a

striking similarity to that observed in the interactions of calmodulin, a non-NCS calcium binding protein, with its target proteins. The similarity suggests that the structural basis for the calcium-mediated conformational triggering mechanism occurring in KChIP might be analogous to that of calmodulin. Results Creation of KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 Complex We initially explored ways to establish a stoichiometric complex of KChIP1 and Kv4.2 fragment that would allow us to determine the atomic details of this interaction. Coexpression of KChIP1 with Kv4.2 T1 domain (residues 40­146) in E. coli (BL21) failed to produce any complex. Instead, a binary complex was formed by co-expression of KChIP1 with either the whole N-terminal domain (residues 1­146) or just N-terminal fragment (residues 1­40), but with varying degrees of stability and structural homogeneity. These results emphasize the essential role of the N-terminal end of Kv4.2 to interact with KChIP1. Finally, we found that a fusion construct made by linking the core of rat (Rattus norvegicus) KChIP1 (KChIP1*,

residues 34­216) to the N-terminal 30 residues of rat Kv4.2 (Kv4.2N30, residues 1­30) (Figure 1), such that the first residue Met1 of Kv4.2N30 was linked directly to the last residue Met216 of KChIP1*, creates a highly soluble and crystallizable protein complex (Table 1) in solution (KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30). To establish the functional relevance of this covalent fusion complex, we first tested if the presence of the Kv4.2N30 in the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 complex occluded modulation of Kv4.2 by its KChIP1* part. Like KChIP1, co-expression of Kv4.2 with KChIP1* produces a large increase ( 50-fold) in cell surface expression and alters channel gating properties in the same manner (Figures 2A­2C and 2F, Table 2). However, KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 completely lacks the ability to modulate either the expression or gating properties of Kv4.2 (Figure 2D). Second, co-immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 protein expresses well (Figure 2G). However, unlike KChIP1 and KChIP1*, KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 cannot be pulled down by K4.2 antibody and vice versa, which indicates it has simply lost its ability to bind to the Kv4.2 channel. Can its inability to bind to Kv4.2 channel be due to structural changes in KChIP1* as a result of its covalent linkage to the N terminus of Kv4.2N30? To further test if the fusion interferes with its normal functional interaction, we fused KChIP1* to a full-length Kv4.2 in the identical manner (KChIP1*Kv4.2) and characterized the functional expression of this chimera. The chimera KChIP1*-Kv4.2 expressed robustly in CHO cells, with functional expression properties comparable to the co-expression of KChIP1* and Kv4.2 (Figures 2E and 2F, Table 3). This functional modu-

lation is KChIP specific, since GFP fusion to the N terminus of Kv4 does not significantly increase surface expression of the channels (Figure 2F; Anderson et al., 2000; Hatano et al., 2002). Table 2 summarizes that there are at least four major modulatory effects on Kv4.2 by either KChIP1 or KChIP1*. They are (1) the fractional loss of the fast-phase inactivation and increase of the slow-phase inactivation, (2) left shift of activation, (3) right shift of inactivation, and (4) the approximately 3-fold faster recovery from inactivation (Table 2). These functional changes are the same with the KChIP1*-Kv4.2 chimera. Therefore, these results indicate that the covalent fusion itself does not disrupt the normal functional relationship between KChIP1 and Kv4.2. Taken together, we conclude that the presence of Kv4.2N30 in the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 simply recapitulates the functional interaction between KChIP1 and Kv4.2. Structure of the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 Complex The excellent solution properties and the supporting functional results for KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 permitted us to use the complex for crystallization and to examine molecular interaction between Kv4.2N30 and KChIP1* at atomic resolution (PDB code 1S6C) (Figure 3, Table ° 1). The 2.0 A crystal structure shows that, like other NCS proteins, KChIP1* consists of two pairs of EF-hands (EF-1, EF-2 and EF-3, EF-4). Each EF-hand consists of a helix-strand-helix motif. The eight helices (H2 through H9) within the four EF-hands will be referred as E1, F1 for EF-1; E2, F2 for EF-2; and so on (Figure 3A). The strands (S1, S2) of EF-1 and EF-2 form one antiparallel sheet, as do strands (S3, S4) of EF-3 and EF-4

(Figure 3B). EF-1 and EF-2 linked through hydrogen bonds of the first sheet form the N lobe, as EF-3 and EF-4 form the C lobe. Two more helices (H1, H10) are located on N and C termini, respectively, both of which have important structural roles. The first 20 residues of Kv4.2 form an helix ( 1) that is kinked around Pro10, a conserved residue among Kv4 channels. The four EF-

hands together form a shell-shaped conformation and create a hydrophobic groove inside the shell where H10 and 1 are connected nearly colinearly running from the EF-4 end of the shell to the EF-1 end (Figure 3B). Thus, the H10 primarily interacts with the C lobe of KChIP and Kv4.2 1 with the N lobe. The whole complex is a dimer both in solution and in the crystal. The second pair of

H10 and 1 run antiparallel next to the first one and are surrounded by the clam-shaped KChIP1* dimer. In the final model, there are two regions that lack sufficient electron density: residues 160­170 of KChIP1 and 21­30 of Kv4.2, likely due to the high conformational flexibility of these regions. Within each molecule, EF-1 and EF-2 make major contacts with 1, but there is no evident electron density for bound Ca2 in these two EF-hands. In contrast, EF-3 and EF-4 are loaded with Ca2 and interact directly with H10. A long-range conformational coupling between the N and C lobes can explain how the Ca2 bound C lobe can affect the binding of 1 in the N lobe. Ca2 Bound and Ca2 -Free EF-Hands of KChIP1 EF-3 and EF-4 of KChIP1*, bound by H10, are canonical EF-hands, whereas EF-1 and EF-2 are slightly degenerated (Figure 3C). Seven oxygens coordinate Ca2 with a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. Two oxygens come from a water molecule and a main chain carboxy group, and the others come from side chains of D (1), N/D (3), D/N (5), and E (12), where the numbers in parenthesis are the positions within the canonical EF-hand (Figures 1 and 3C; Yang et al., 2002). EF-1 and EF-2 of KChIP1 lack these canonical side chain residues (Figure 3C), explaining the absence of Ca2 in these EF-hands. An important characteristic of the EF-hand is the interhelical angle between E and F, which varies based on the occupancy of Ca2 (Yap et al., 2002). Table 3 comTable 3. Interhelical Angles of EF-Hands Recoverin KChIP1 1JSA E1/F1 E2/F2 E3/F3 E4/F4 94 103 97Ca 108Ca 119 123Ca 94Ca 88 1IKU(apo) 169 131 120 96 Calmodulin* 1CDL 89Ca** 85Ca 98Ca 99Ca 1G4Y 1CFD(apo) 95Ca 86Ca 97 91 137 130 133 138

pares the interhelical angles of KChIP1 with Ca2 -free and Ca2 bound recoverin and calmodulin. Conformational changes upon Ca2 binding in recoverin and calmodulin are clearly reflected in these angles (Ames et al., 1997; Finn et al., 1995; Gagne et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1995). The definition of the interhelical angle (angle to rotate one helix to be parallel with the other helix in the same direction) dictates that the bigger the interhelical angle is, the smaller the space is between two helices. Table 3 shows that the conformational changes triggered by Ca2 binding open up the EF-hands and expose the hydrophobic pockets of both true Ca2 binding and pseudo-EF-hands. In other words, Ca2 binding triggers conformational change for all EF-hands including pseudo-EF-hands. The four interhelical angles of KChIP1 are similar to the angles from Ca2 -bound recoverin and calmodulin, which suggests that the Ca2 -free EF-1 and EF-2 hands and Ca2 bound EF-3 and EF-4 hands of KChIPs undergo similar conformational change upon Ca2 binding as recoverin and calmodulin. Trp8 and Phe11 of Kv4.2 Are Key Interface Residues between KChIPs and Kv4.2 The structure reveals that Trp8 and Phe11 of Kv4.2 provides two major side chains at the interface that bind into the deep hydrophobic pocket formed by side chains from EF-1 and EF-2 (Figure 4). The key residues of the pocket are Val69, Phe74, Ile77, Tyr78, and Phe98 for Trp8 of Kv4.2; Val55, Leu56, and Phe60 for Phe11 of Kv4.2; and Phe111 and Leu115 contribute to both binding sites. The conserved Pro10 between Trp8 and Phe11 bends the 1 helix to allow Trp8 and Phe11 to fit into the pocket. In contrast to the extensive hydrophobic interaction of 1 with the N lobe, H10 has a shallow hydrophobic interaction with the C lobe, primarily through residues Ile205, Met206, and Leu209 that lie close to the molecular surface. To test the functional significance of Trp8 and Phe11, both residues in the intact Kv4.2 channel were mutated simultaneously to alanines, and this potential KChIP binding (KCB)-defective channel, Kv4.2 KCB, was expressed with and without KChIP1. Expression of Kv4.2 KCB alone in CHO cells produced currents similar to those of wild-type Kv4.2 channels alone (Figure 5A). However,

Cell lysates were co-immunoprecipitated with control goat IgG (lane 2 in each panel), and goat anti-Kv4.2 (lane 3). Western blots were probed with anti-Kv4.2, anti-HA for KChIP1, 2a, or anti-KChIP3. (C) Comparison of peak currents at 50 mV from different co-expressions of KChIPs with Kv4.2 or Kv4.2 KCB. (D) Confocal images of Kv4.2 distributions in the absence or presence of KChIPs detected by staining with rabbit anti-Kv4.2 and Alexa488 conjugated secondary antibody, showing modulation of expression of Kv4.2 and Kv4.2 KCB by different KChIPs. When expressed by itself, Kv4.2 is mainly localized in the intracellular ER/Golgi compartment. Coexpression of different KChIPs with Kv4.2 greatly increases the cell surface distribution and decreased its intracellular accumulation (arrow in left panel). Like Kv4.2, Kv4.2 KCB mutant is also localized in the intracellular compartment when transfected alone. However, the Kv4.2 KCB distribution does not change in the presence of KChIPs and it remains trapped in the intracellular compartment (arrow in right panel).

unlike wild-type Kv4.2, co-expression of Kv4.2 KCB with KChIP1 produces neither enhancement of cell surface expression nor changes in functional properties. Therefore, these two mutations clearly disrupt the KCB interface required for KChIP1 binding. Co-immunoprecipitation confirms that the loss of modulation is due to a failure of KChIP1 to bind to Kv4.2 KCB (Figure 5B). We sought to test if this binding interface between KChIP1 and Kv4.2 channels is shared with other members of the KChIP gene family. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirms that this mutation eliminates binding of KChIP2a and KChIP3 to Kv4.2 KCB as well (Figure 5B). As predicted, KChIP2a and 3 do not modulate the expression level or gating properties of Kv4.2 KCB (Figure 5C). Kv4.2 KCB channels, when co-expressed with KChIP1, 2a, or 3, fail to move to the cell surface in contrast to wild-type Kv4.2 channel (Figure 5D). Taken together, these results show conclusively that KChIP

proteins share this conserved KCB motif required to bind and modulate Kv4 channels. Common Binding Mode of NCS-Ligand Interaction The Trp8/Phe11 (W8/F11) binding pocket of KChIPs (red boxes in Figure 1A) are particularly conserved among other NCS proteins, indicating that the W8/F11 pocket of KChIP is likely to be used as a protein-interaction interface by other NCS proteins. Frequenin, recoverin, and neurocalcin are three other NCS proteins whose Ca2 bound crystal structures are known (Bourne et al., 2001; Flaherty et al., 1993; Vijay-Kumar and Kumar, 1999). Figure 4B highlights the conserved hydrophobic surface (shown in red) of the structurally equivalent residues forming the W8/F11 pocket of all four NCS structures. Among these four structures, KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 is the only one with target peptide (shown in green) bound. Functional expression studies indicate that only KChIPs

and frequenin, but not neurocalcin, hippocalcin, visininlike protein (VILIP)-1, nor recoverin, can recognize Kv4 channels (Guo et al., 2002; Nakamura et al., 2001). Given this common structural framework for interaction, the conserved LFxxVM (211­216) motif of H10, which plays an important role in trans interactions in the dimer interface, is conserved only in KChIPs and frequenin, and thus is likely the major specificity-encoding determinant for interaction with Kv4 channels (Figure 4).

Dimer Interface between KChIP1* and Kv4.2N30 The crystal structure of the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 complex dimer shows that the clam-shaped dimer encloses two antiparallel H10- 1 helices (Figure 3B). The 2-fold axis relating the two subunits of the dimer lies between the shells and perpendicular to the H10- 1 helices, such that the N lobe from one subunit will face the C lobe from the other subunit. This particular conformation of the dimeric complex allows Ca2 -dependent conformational changes to propagate across the dimer interface. At the center of the dimer, the pair of antiparallel H101 helices cross over each other. At the crossing point are Ala2, Ala3, and Ala6 of 1, all notably small side chains that allow the dimer to maintain a close contact (Figure 4A). In addition to the intramolecular (cis-) interactions between the Trp8 and Phe11 of Kv4.2 and the N lobe of KChIP1, intermolecular (trans-) interactions between the two monomers are also very important for stable complex formation. Four phenylalanine residues, Phe81 and Phe82 from each KChIP1 subunit, cluster on one side of the hydrophobic pocket. These extensive hydrophobic interactions create a wall that appears to prevent the 1 helices from sliding away from the binding pocket (Figure 4A). Leu9 of 1 and four H10 residues of the LFxxVM (211­216) motif form the major intermolecular interface. Leu9 is also surrounded by Ile154, Met157, and Met158 from the helix F3 (H7). Conserved Leu211 additionally makes contact with Trp8 and Phe11 of 1 of the other monomer. Surrounding this hydrophobic interface are hydrophilic interactions, most of which are conserved in the NCS family, formed by Asp202, Asn204, and Arg207 of F4 (H9; C lobe) interacting with Thr49, Arg51, Glu52, and Gln54 of E1 (H2; N lobe) from the opposite monomer.

functionally (Figures 6A and 6B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiment shows that although the KChIP1 H10 protein is made in cells, it is unable to bind and coassemble with Kv4.2 proteins (Figure 6C). To exclude the possibility that the inability of KChIP1* H10 to bind is due to its defective folding, we used circular dichroism spectroscopy to check the secondary structure composition of KChIP1* H10. CD spectrum of KChIP1* H10 shows the typical ellipticity minima expected for an helix-rich protein, and the comparison with those of KChIP1* and KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 demonstrates that all share the same structural scaffold (Figure 6D). N and C Lobes of Calcium Binding EF-Hand Proteins Cooperatively Interact with Their Targets Under the tight control of Ca2 -dependent conformational changes, essential to the stability of the dimer are the N and C lobes from the opposite KChIP1 subunits that together form the hydrophobic groove through which the H10 and 1 helices run (Figure 4A). This interaction mode is strikingly similar to the way calmodulin binds its target peptides. Figure 7 shows a comparison of the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 complex with two representative calmodulin/target structures: CaM/smMLCK (smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase; Figure 7A) and CaM/ SK (small-conductance Ca2 -activated K channel; Figure 7C) (Meador et al., 1992; Schumacher et al., 2001). All complexes share similar topology such that one N and one C lobe face each other to create the central peptide binding pocket. CaM/smMLCK is a monomer complex, whereas the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 and CaM/SK are both dimeric. However, in both calmodulin complexes, the N and C lobes come from a single molecule (Figures 7A and 7C), whereas in KChIP1*, the N and C lobes are provided by the two monomers separately (Figure 7B). Despite these differences, the salient feature is that the central pocket can vary its volume to accommodate one, two, or even three peptide helices using a variable linker between the N and C lobes (Figure 1A; Clapperton et al., 2002; Meador et al., 1993). Given the similar scaffold for peptide binding, the diversity of their target specificity can be partly encoded by varying the space provided between N and C lobes, as demonstrated by calmodulin's known ability to interact with more than 20 different targets. Discussion

H10 Is Essential for the KChIP1 Function Our structural comparison between 1 bound KChIP1* and free form of frequenin, therefore, suggests a possible role for H10 in their binding of Kv4 channels. Interestingly, in the crystal structure of human frequenin, which is a monomer, the central groove is not bound by H10, but is occupied by several poly-ethylene glycol molecules (PDB code 1G8I). We propose that H10 can be dynamic such that it is stably locked in the C lobe groove only when the N lobe groove of the pocket is filled with 1, at which point the Ca2 bound dimer can be stably formed. Consistent with this idea, we find that a truncated KChIP1 that lacks H10 (KChIP1 H10) no longer modulates Kv4.2 expression level or gating properties

In this study, we have characterized the molecular interaction between rat KChIP1 and rat Kv4.2 N terminus both structurally and functionally. Functional studies with other KChIP proteins show that they also interact with Kv4.2 using the same conserved interface. Several key features identified in the structure of KChIP1*Kv4.2N30 are fundamental to the interaction between KChIPs and Kv4 channels. The sequence WLPF (residues 8­11) of the N terminus of Kv4.2 provides critical hydrophobic residues for the KChIP1 binding interface. Both Trp8 and Phe11 bind into hydrophobic pocket within the N lobe of KChIP1, whereas Leu9 interacts in trans with H10 and the C lobe of the opposite KChIP1 subunit. Pro10 must provide an important backbone

conformation and rigidity in the peptide chain that allows an optimal fit into the hydrophobic binding pocket. N lobes of KChIP1 and other NCS proteins, recoverin, frequenin, and neurocalcin share a similar conformation to provide the hydrophobic pocket. It will be interesting to find out whether some peptides bind into the other

N lobe pockets in the similar way. Recently, genetics and NMR studies on the interactions between yeast frequenin (or human NCS-1) and yeast phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (Pik1) showed that the frequenin binding segment of Pik1 appears -helical (Huttner et al., 2003; Strahl et al., 2003), just like the secondary structure of

Kv4.2 1. NMR structures of recoverin showed that the N lobe pocket is occupied by myristoylated N-terminal segment in its Ca2 -free conformation and the pocket is exposed following Ca2 binding (Ames et al., 1997). The truncation of the N-terminal variable region of KChIP1 does not have a significant effect on KChIP1 interaction with Kv4 channels (An et al., 2000). But it appears that the myristoylation near the N terminus of KChIP is essential for the membrane targeting in a Ca2 -independent manner (O'Callaghan and Burgoyne, 2003), which is different from the mechanism of Ca2 -triggered exposure of N lobe pocket of recoverin. Regardless, our results clearly place the 1 segment in the hydrophobic groove of KChIP dimer both structurally and functionally as an essential element of the Ca2 -induced conformation. The binding of H10 itself into the hydrophobic pocket of the C lobe provides crucial residues to stabilize the hydrophobic interaction of the KChIP dimer. Among members of the NCS family, only frequenin and KChIPs have the four conserved residues of H10 that play important roles in dimeric complex formation (LYDGLV and LF(Q/D/E)NV(M/I) for frequenin and KChIPs, respectively). The strong conservation of these H10 residues emphasizes the important role of KChIP dimerization in functional interaction with Kv4 channels. There is a report that a new KChIP2 isoform (KChIP2d), corresponding to the last 70 residues of other KChIPs (residues 147­216 in KChIP1), retains the regulatory ability of KChIP in a Ca2 -dependent manner (Patel et al., 2002). Based on our structure, KChIP2d starts from near the C-terminal end of F3 to the end of H10, constituting most of the C lobe and H10, thereby retaining its potential to interact with Kv4.2 Leu9. We recognize that the covalent linkage between H10 and 1 doesn't exist in nature. Therefore, the N-terminal end of 1 should not be constrained by covalent linkage. To verify the conformation of the complex without the covalent linkage between Met216 of KChIP1 and Met1 of Kv4.2N30, we made the inversed fusion complex with N-terminal his-tagged Kv4.2N30 followed by KChIP1* (Kv4.2N30-KChIP1*). Based on the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 structure, the fusion linker is flexible and long enough to allow 1 to bind into the pocket freely. Now the difference from original KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 is that the N-terminal end of Kv4.2N30 is not covalently linked to KChIP1, like the free N-terminal end of Kv4.2 channel, except that there are extra residues from the 8-histidine linker upstream of Met1 of Kv4.2N30. Interestingly, in order to stabilize the complex formation, the his-tag has to be cleaved off by thrombin after affinity purification (data not shown). Normally, the cleavage site (LeuValProArgGlySer) should be well exposed in solution in order for thrombin to bind and cleave. In this study, it is necessary to insert a 6-glycine linker between thrombin cleavage site and Met1 of Kv4.2 to extend the distance between them. Without the 6-glycine linker, the his-tag cannot be completely removed and the protein sample is mainly dimeric but inhomogeneous (data not shown). This observation is consistent with the presented structure where the N terminus of Kv4.2 is located deeply inside the groove so that the N terminus of Kv4.2 is protected from enzyme access. Just like the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 dimer complex (Figure 7D, red), we find that Kv4.2N30KChIP1* is dimeric and homogeneous (Figure 7D, green)

and can be disrupted by chelating Ca2 using EDTA (Figure 7D, blue). The elution of the Ca2 -free ApoKv4.2N30-KChIP1* is retarded on size exclusion column, suggesting either monomeric size or the increased hydrophobicity, possibly due to exposed hydrophobic pockets or hydrophobic 1. Given the covalent fusion we introduced in order to generate a stable complex between KChIP1* and Kv4.2N30, it is important to ask whether the molecular interface we derived from the covalently bound KChIP1*Kv4.2N30 complex accurately reflects the interaction present between KChIP1 and Kv4.2 channel in the membrane. Despite this inherent technical limitation, we conclude that there are four major observations that validate the accuracy of the molecular interface. First, the surface expression and gating properties of channels formed with KChIP1* fused to the N-terminal end of Kv4.2 are indistinguishable to those of Kv4.2 coexpressed with KChIP1* (Figure 2) by all experimental measures. Second, a sitespecific mutant of Kv4.2 carrying changes at the KChIPfacing interface specifically disrupts its ability to interact with KChIP (Figure 5). Third, the H10-deletion mutant of KChIP1* disrupts its ability to interact with Kv4.2, consistent with its proposed role in forming the dimeric complex (Figure 6). The amino acids of H10 responsible for the dimer interface are shared between frequenin and KChIP, further validating the common dimeric scaffold formed between Kv4 channels and these proteins. Fourth, the reversed covalent chimera Kv4.2N30-KChIP1* shows indistinguishable solution characteristics as compared to that of KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30, supporting the notion that the underlying nature of molecular interaction between the two was unaltered by covalent modification. Additionally, the structural similarity between calmodulin-peptide and KChIP-peptide interactions highlights a possible mechanistic commonality of channels by calcium (Figure 7). Our results are consistent with the putative channel binding groove proposed by chimeric studies on KChIP2 (Ren et al., 2003). Our results, however, have not excluded other weak interactions between KChIP1 and any other part of Kv4.2 channel (for instance, T1 domain). KChIPs Modulate Kv4 Channel Expression and Gating Properties Important questions remain as to how the local interactions between the N termini of Kv4 channels and KChIPs are translated into enhanced A-type current amplitude and altered gating properties. Biophysical studies have shown that KChIP1 binding does not increase single channel current (Beck et al., 2002), but rather the macroscopic current by increasing the density of functional channel surface expression. This can be achieved by altering channel transcription, translation, turnover rates, or subcellular distribution. With KChIP co-expression, we typically find higher expression level of Kv4.2 channel proteins as well as a clear redistribution of the expressed channels to the cell surface. N-terminal domains of membrane proteins often contain ER retention signals or retrieval signals, and cytoplasmic auxiliary proteins may bind and cover such signals to promote channel trafficking to cell membranes. In support of this hypothesis, N-terminal deletion of the

KChIP/Kv Channel Interactions 583

first 40 residues of Kv4.2 causes an increase in channel expression, similar to KChIP1 binding (Bahring et al., 2001). The exact nature of the putative Kv4.2 retention signal remains unclear. Possibly the arginine-based ER retention/retrieval mechanism discovered for several membrane proteins (Ma and Jan, 2002) may utilize one or both of the two conserved arginines, Arg13 and Arg37, as a signal. Deletion of the first 40 residues of Kv4.2 also mimics some of the gating aspects of KChIP modulation of Kv4.2. In particular, this deletion slows down the rate of fast inactivation, which is similar to KChIP modulation. Such effects would be predicted if the N terminus of Kv4.2 acts as an inactivation "ball" peptide; however, the precise mechanisms responsible for inactivation of Kv4.2 channels remain to be better understood (Gebauer et al., 2004). The Role of a Dimeric Interaction in Modulating a Tetrameric Channel The Kv4.2 1 is linked to the tetrameric assembly domain of Kv4.2 T1 (residues 40­146) structure (Nanao et al., 2003). We find that the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 dimer doesn't form a stable complex with Kv4.2T1 tetramer in solution, although we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility of a weak interaction between them. Therefore, the spatial relationship in nature between KChIP1 and Kv4.2 cannot be determined precisely. However, based on our observation of the near 4:4 complex of KChIP1* with the whole N-terminal domain (1­146) of Kv4.2, we stipulate that the fundamental interaction unit of KChIPs with Kv4 channels might be a pair of KChIP dimers binding to the tetrameric channel. The 4:4 stoichiometry was also derived from a Kv4.2-KChIP2 complex isolated from the native cell membrane (Kim et al., 2003). So it remains open how the 2-fold symmetric Ca2 -stablilized KChIP1*Kv4.2N30 dimer is connected to the 4-fold rotationally symmetric Kv4.2T1 tetramer, creating a potential symmetry mismatch between KChIP and Kv4.2. Interestingly, other protein structures have identified similar dimeric modulatory interactions with channels (Roosild et al., 2004). The KTN domain, found in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic potassium channels and transporters, is a tetramer in solution postulated to form a tetramer as a dimer of two hinged dimers (Roosild et al., 2002). The hinged dimer is also a common building block of the RCK octomeric gate ring (Jiang et al., 2001, 2002). RCK dimer's hinge motion regulated by Ca2 is structurally equivalent to KTN dimer's hinge regulated by NAD(H). Most recently, the bacterial inwardly rectifying K channel (Kuo et al., 2003) shows a slight asymmetry for the cytoplasmic regulatory domain in the dimerof-dimer arrangement. The dimerization of calmodulin with the C-terminal calmodulin binding domain in SK channels shows the most similar mode of interaction (Schumacher et al., 2001), in which Ca2 acts as a switch from monomer to dimeric complex. The tetrameric assembly of the C-terminal (linker and cyclic nucleotide binding) domain of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels is another example for which a ligand-dependent conversion of its oligomeric state has been observed (Zagotta et al., 2003; Ulens and Siegelbaum, 2003). These results further impli-

cate the dimer-of-dimer model as a mechanism for ligand-mediated regulation of HCN channels (Liu et al., 1998). Ca2 Switch for Kv4 Channel Regulation We showed Ca2 is required to maintain the KChIP1*Kv4.2N30 complex as a stable dimer (Figure 7D). Chelating Ca2 facilitates dissociation of the complex. The requirement of Ca2 for stable interaction is consistent with extensive studies about calmodulin. Comparison of the apo-calmodulin structure with the Ca2 -loaded crystal structure reveals that the most prominent effect produced by Ca2 binding is to expose the hydrophobic pockets of EF-hands (Ames et al., 1999; Finn et al., 1995; Gagne et al., 1995; Kuboniwa et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1995). In the structure of KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30, EF-1 and EF-2 forming the N lobe lack bound Ca2 . So, it raises an obvious question as to how Ca2 binding to the C lobe could affect interactions between 1 and the N lobe. Based on the comparison of the interhelical angles discussed above, like recoverin and calmodulin, the four EF-hands all undergo Ca2 -dependent conformational change cooperatively. In contrast to Ca2 binding to the C lobe of KChIP1, calmodulin bound to SK channel (PDB code 1G4Y) has Ca2 binding to the N lobe, and calmodulin bound to smMLCK has Ca2 binding to both lobes, yet resulting in the similar concerted conformational change. This concerted change similarly occurs in all EF-hands among different complexes and is a common feature regardless of the identity of the Ca2 binding lobes. By analogy with calmodulin and recoverin, we propose that in KChIP1, conformational change triggered by Ca2 binding into EF3 and EF4 hands will expose the hydrophobic pockets for both H10 and 1, so that H10 and 1 can fit well into the hydrophobic pockets. The relative rotation between the N and C lobe around the conserved Gly121 (Gly96 in recoverin, Figure 1A) can be essential to align the N lobe pocket and the C lobe pocket into a continuous pocket (Ames et al., 1997), a structural prerequisite to form a stable dimeric interface of KChIPs. As evident in the KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30 structure, the presence of H10 provides the intermolecular interface for the other KChIP1 subunit and 1. Only when both 1 and H10 bind into their respective grooves, the two monomers associate to form a dimer, in which the N and C lobes face each other and lock the peptides inside the pocket just like other complexes of calmodulin with their target peptides (Figure 7). If KChIP1 interaction with Kv4.2 channels undergoes an oligomeric change by employing the mode of Ca2 -initiated conformational switch common to KChIPs and calmodulin, the conversion in the oligomeric state can play a role in regulating Kv4 inactivation kinetics allosterically in a manner similar to how calmodulin regulates SK channel conductance.

tains N-terminal his-tag (8-histidine) that is cleavable by thrombin. BL21 (DE3) cells were used to express the protein. Cells were grown in TB media at 37 C and induced with 0.4 mM IPTG (final concentration) when the OD reached 1.0. The temperature was reduced to 30 C after IPTG was added. Cell paste was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme) and lysed for 30 min in cold room. Then the cell lysate was sonicated and the supernatant from high-speed centrifugation was collected and loaded onto Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen). The affinity tag was removed by thrombin, dialyzed against 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and purified by Superdex 75 size exclusion chromatography (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 300 mM NaCl). Finally, the protein was stored at 4 C at a final concentration of 25 mg/ml (5 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 50 mM NaCl). Static Light Scattering machine (Wyatt) was used to determine the molecular size by light scattering independent of molecule hydrodynamic shape, in line with a HPLC (Waters) size exclusion column, TSK-gel G3000PWXL (Tosoh Biosep). Crystals grew at 23 C in hanging drop vapor diffusion plates (Hampton Research). Fresh DTT was added into reservoir solution to 5 mM. 1.5 l protein solution was mixed 1:1 with the reservoir solution containing 100 mM Na cacodylate (pH 6.0), 100 mM MgNO3, and 20% PEG1000. Crystals grew to maximum size within 4 days and were transferred into cryo-protectant containing 24% ethylene glycol in reservoir solution before freezing in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Structure Determination Data were collected at ALS synchrotron facility, beamline 8.2.1, at Berkeley and processed by HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Phases were determined by molecular replacement using EPMR 3.1 (Agouron/Pfizer Inc.) with polyserine model of human frequenin monomer (PDB code 1G8I) as a search model. The best solution was refined by Refmac (CCP4-4.2) and built in O 8.0. Electron density of 1 was modeled automatically by ARP/wARP 6.0 initially and then rebuilt manually. Following iterative cycles of model building and refinement were carried out in O 8.0 and CNS 1.0. The final model contains coordinates for Leu39 to Met216 of KChIP1 except residues 160­170, two Ca2 ions in EF-3 and EF-4 and Met1 to Met20 of Kv4.2. Figures were created by Molscript or Dino, and rendered by PovRay. Circular Dichroism The CD spectra were measured on MOS-450/AF-CD-Kinetic Spectropolarimeter from BioLogic Science Instruments, Inc., with path length of 0.02 mm and peptide bond concentration of 1 mM. The protein samples were dialyzed overnight in 10 mM Tris (pH 8), 50 mM NaCl. The dialysis buffer was used as the blank. Each sample was measured five times over the wavelength range from 190 nm to 250 nm scanned at 2 s/nm. Electrophysiology pCMV-Kv4.2, pCMV-Kv4.2 KCB, pCMV-HA-KChIP1, pCMV-HAKChIP1* (34­216), pCMV-KChIP1*-Kv4.2N30, pCMV-KChIP2a-HA, and pCMV-HA-KChIP3 were constructed by PCR engineering from clones kindly provided by Dr. Lily Jan (rat Kv4.2) and Dr. Susumu Ohya (rat KChIP1, rat KChIP2a) or obtained as ESTs (human KChIP3, image 2402415). The sequences for all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Channel functional properties were characterized in CHO cells following transient transfection using either FuGENE 6 or Lipofectamine transfection reagents essentially as described previously (Strang et al., 2003). Cells were clamped using an Axopatch 200A and voltage clamp protocols and analyses were performed using pClamp7.0 software (Axon Instruments). Figures were composed in Origin 6.0 (Origin Lab Corp.) Co-immunoprecipitation Assay COS7 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 150K/well and transfected the next day with DNA (1 g DNA per well for each construct) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche). 40­44 hr after transfection, co-immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 C. Cells were lysed for 1 hr with lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1% Triton) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche). The supernatant from centrifugation was then incubated with goat IgG

(ICN), goat Kv4.2-Ab (Santa Cruz, C20), or goat HA-Ab (Santa Cruz, Y-11-G) at a 10 g/ml final concentration overnight. The mixtures were then incubated with UltraLink immobilized A/G beads (Pierce) for 2 hr to pull down the antibody-antigen complex. The beads were washed 3 times with the lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors followed by centrifugation (2500 g). The bound complexes eluted by 10% SDS with 100 M DTT were separated by SDS-PAGE and were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore, Immobilon-P) at 150 mA for 16 hr in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris [pH 8.3], 192 mM glycine) with (for KChIP blots) or without (for Kv4.2 blots) 10% methanol. After pretreatment with 5% milk in TBS (50 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl) at room temperature for 2 hr, the blotted membranes were incubated overnight with rabbit Kv4.2-Ab (Chemicon, AB5360), mouse HA-Ab (Babco), rat HA-Ab (Roche), or rabbit KChIP3-Ab (Santa Cruz, FL214). After 3 washes with TBS, the blots were incubated with 1:10,000 HRP-conjugated goat Ab raised against rabbit, mouse, or rat IgG (Pierce) for visualization by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry COS7 cells were plated in 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) at 25K/well and transfected the next day with DNA (0.2 g DNA per well for each construct) using the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche). 40­44 hr after adding the DNA, cells were washed with PBS (58 mM Na2HPO4, 17 mM NaH2PO4, 68 mM NaCl) 3 times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then permeablized and preblocked with 10% NGS and 0.2% Triton in PBS. The cells were then incubated with 5 g/ml rabbit Kv4.2-Ab (Chemicon) and 1 g/ml mouse HA-Ab (Covance, 16B12) for 1 hr at room temperature. After being washed with PBS 3 times, the cells were incubated with Alexa488-conjugated goat Ab against rabbit IgG or Alexa594conjugated goat Ab against mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1 hr at room temperature.
