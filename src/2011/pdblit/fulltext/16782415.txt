that the maintenance of constant basal Ca 2+ levels in unstimulated cells was an incontrovertible fact of biology. The expression of AEQ in plants established for the first time that the average basal level of intracellular Ca 2+ is not constant over long time intervals, but that the setpoint for calcium levels is under the control of a circadian oscillator. 147 Figure 2 shows data of transgenic tobacco seedlings in which the apoaequorin has been targeted to different compartments (cytosol, chloroplast stroma, nucleus).184 These time-course data show that Ca 2+ regulation is not the same in different compartments, again illustrating the utility of targetable reporters. Finally, a method using a protein splicing-based complementation of a split reporter, either GFP or firefly luciferase, has been developed for reporting proteinprotein interactions.185,186 This is a matter of central importance and great interest in biology, and the method overcomes limitations inherent in the commonly used yeast two-hybrid assay, as well as other methods.

[4] Fluorescent Amino Acid Analogs
By SUSAN M. TWINEand ARTHUR G. SZABO
The use of fluorescence probes as reporters of structure, dynamics, interactions, and local microenvironments is now commonplace in studying biological systems. In this article, we review the use of analogs of tryptophan (Trp) as intrinsic probes of protein structure in protein bimolecular complexes. We first summarize how various Trp analogs can be used in studies of protein complexes. The fluorescence properties of the fluorinated Trp analogs are reviewed and shown to be useful tools in fluorescence studies of proteins. Methods of analog incorporation into proteins and methods of determining the degree of analog incorporation into an expressed protein are then discussed. Finally, we review some of the more recent data conceming the effects of analog incorporation on protein structure and function, some new analogs, and their applications.

Background Among biopolymers, proteins are unique in displaying intrinsic fluorescence chromophores that provide valuable information about their structure, dynamics, and segmental molecular details. Trp, as the dominant fluorophore, has a number of well-documented properties including its sensitivity to environmental factors and its usefulness in reporting protein conformational changes, subunit associations, denaturation, and ligand binding. To study a particular Trp-containing protein in a complex with another Trpcontaining protein presents difficulties in resolving and assigning the fluorescence properties to the several Trp components. This problem can be circumvented in two ways. Trp residues may be removed by site-directed mutagenesis, so that one protein can be rendered fluorescently "silent," with respect to Trp fluorescence. This process can perturb protein secondary structure and influence the function of the protein. Alternatively, analogs of Trp can be biosynthetically incorporated into one of the protein partners in place of Trp. Analogs, such as 7-azatryptophan (7AW) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HW), have red extended absorbance spectra in relation to Trp. These analogs have structures similar to the indole moiety in Trp, so that there should be a negligible effect on protein structure and function. They present the advantage of fluorescence excitation at wavelengths longer than the absorbance of Trp and thus their fluorescence can be selectively excited. Historically, amino acid analogs were used in the 1950s to investigate metabolite pathways and mechanisms of protein synthesis.l'2 Pardee et aL 1 described the growth of an E s c h e r i c h i a coli auxotroph on medium containing 2-azatryptophan (2AW), 7AW, and 5-methyltryptophan (5MEW). Figure 1 shows the structures of some fluorescent Trp analogs. Bacterial growth was sustained on all but the 5MeW-containing medium. Presumably, the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase cannot form 5MeW adenylate and acylate the tRNA Try with this analog. Later reports investigated the role of the essential enzyme in the process of analog incorporation, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS).I-5 TrpRS aminoacylates the cognate tRNA with Trp, or its analog, which is then incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. The mechanisms of TrpRS in the presence of Trp and various analogs are under active investigation. This laboratory has developed an assay for prokaryotic TrpRS activity based on the formation of 7AW-adenylate, exploiting the acute environmental sensitivity of its fluorescence.4,5

FIG. 1. Structures of tryptophan analogs. The earliest example of a purified analog-containing protein was alkaline phosphatase. 6 The enzyme was expressed in the presence of either 7AW or 2AW. No change in enzyme activity was reported, but large changes in the absorbance and fluorescence spectra of the protein were observed. By the 1970s fluorinated analogs were used for 19F N M R (nuclear magnetic resonance) studies of proteins. Several articles summarize the use of fluorinated Trp and fluorinated phenylalanine (Phe) analogs in N]VIR,7,8 the discussion of which are beyond the scope of this article. Early attempts to incorporate Trp analogs into proteins were hampered by the lack of protein expression technology. In certain instances, when the protein expression was under the control of a natural inducible promoter, a high degree of analog incorporation was achieved. 6 In the absence of an inducible promoter the degree of analog incorporation was observed to be highly unpredictable, as 6 S. Schlesinger,J. Biol. Chem. 243, 3877 (1968). 7 B. D. Sykes, H. I. Weinarte, and M. J. Schlesinger,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 71, 469 (1974). 8 F. A. Pratt and C. Ho, Biochemistry 14, 3035 (1975).

both Trp and the analog were required to sustain cell growth. The development of expression vectors with tightly regulated protein expression has reduced the unpredictability of analog incorporation. Interest in the use of Trp analogs as spectroscopic probes has been renewed. Petrich et al. conducted a number of studies of the photophysics of 7AW, and its parent chromophoric moiety, 7-azaindole (7AI). 9-19 Similar studies have proved to be essential if the fluorescence signal of the analogs is to be correctly interpreted when incorporated into protein systems. In 1992, groups led by Szabo and by Ross independently demonstrated the potential of 5HW as a probe of protein-protein 2° and protein-nucleic acid interactions. 21 In both cases the red extended shoulder of the analog absorbance was retained, allowing a window for selective red-edge excitation of the 5HW chromophore in the presence of proteins and nucleic acids. The use of this, and other Trp analogs, as biosynthetically incorporated protein structural probes has grown significantly since this time.

observed at 370 nm, whereas in aqueous buffer a broad maximum is centered at 412 nm. 6'22 Early denaturation experiments also recognized the dramatic quenching effect of water. 6 Exploitation of the acute environmental sensitivity of 7AW permits its use as a probe of protein structural changes and ligand binding. The fluorescence decay behavior of 7AW is complex after excitation, exhibiting multiexponential decay kinetics 5' 10,12,23 similar to Trp in proteins. Contrary to expressed views, this complexity increases the information content, when the 7AW photophysics are well understood. It has been shown that 7AW can be highly valuable as a biological probe, providing spectral information regarding changes in solvation, frequently associated with protein structural perturbations and ligand-binding reactions. 5HW is a naturally occurring amino acid that is not found in any naturally occurring protein, and it is a precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin. 5HW has a higher quantum yield in water (0.21) in comparison with Trp (0.14), with an emission maximum of 339 nm. 22 The fluorescence maximum of this analog is relatively insensitive to changes in the solvation state of its environment. However, a decrease in 5HW quantum yield in acetonitrile, to 0.18, was observed. 22 The highly structured red-extended absorbance shoulder of 5HW has been shown to be almost entirely 1Lb in nature. The 1Lb transition of 5HW has little or no solvent sensitivity, occurs at a lower energy level than the 1La transition, and can be selectively excited at wavelengths longer than 315 nm. The most distinct advantage of 5HW as a fluorescence probe originates from this nonoverlapping nature of the 1La and I L b transitions above 310 nm. Selective excitation of the singlet Lb state in 5HW allows its use as an effective anisotropy probe because its fluorescence is not depolarized via internal conversion processes. Therefore, proteins containing 5HW have significantly higher anisotropy values compared with the same protein containing Trp. This was first demonstrated with studies of the 5HW "model" compound, t-Boc(ot-amino)5HW, 21 and Y57(5HW)oncomodulin. 2° 4-Fluorotryptophan (4FW) has been reported to be nonfluorescent in aqueous solution, at room temperature, 24 and if biosynthetically incorporated into a protein can be used to eliminate Trp fluorescence, obviating the need to remove the Trp residue from the protein by site-directed mutagenesis. 5-Fluorotryptophan and 6-Fluorotryptophan These analogs have been used primarily in 19F NMR spectroscopy, as pioneered by the groups of Sykes and Ho, 7,8 and have not been used extensively as spectroscopic probes of protein structure and interactions until more recently.

This approach is advantageous, requiting only minor modifications to existing protein expression protocols, and is capable of producing milligram quantities of mutant protein. Other strategies, such as in vitro transcrption/translafion using nonsense tRNA molecules, chemically misacylated with a Trp analog, have been developed

and are discussed in the following sections. 23'25-29 Total chemical synthesis of peptides containing analogs has been accomplished and further developed to produce synthetic proteins.
Methods o f Analog Incorporation

Previously two methods for the biosynthetic incorporation of analogs have been described. 23 To facilitate the incorporation of the analog of interest the expression system for the protein of interest must be transferred to an organism that is a Trp auxotroph. Escherichia coli is the most commonly used organism selected as the host strain for protein expression and a number ofE. coli Trp auxotrophs are available for use. To maximize the synthesis of analog mutant protein the expression system must be under the control of a stringent, nonleaky promoter. A leaky promoter will lead to high levels of basal expression, causing the accumulation of protein containing natural Trp. Factors influencing the level of analog incorporation are numerous and in our experience depend on the expression system, the protein being expressed, as well as other environmental factors. To maximize incorporation low levels of basal protein expression are desirable. Hence conditions were developed in which intracellular pools of Trp were depleted before protein expression was induced. One concern is the production of proteins essential to expression of the mutant protein, such as T7 RNA polymerase in the T7 promoter system, 3° which is produced postinduction. Such proteins contain Trp in their native sequence and thus postinduction will result in analog incorporation into these proteins as well as into the protein of interest. This may affect their functionality and subsequent levels of protein expression of the protein of interest. To obtain high yields of the desired protein mutant, two variants of the protein expression protocol are used. Two-Step Method. Normally, the analogs are toxic to cell growth and attempts to incorporate them into expressed proteins in E. coli BL21 cells, for example, by adding analog to the growth medium, have met with only limited success. Furthermore, the extent of analog incorporation is difficult to control under these conditions. 25C. Wong and M. R. Eftink, Biochemistry 37, 8938 (1998). 26j. D. Bain, D. A. Wacker, C. G. Glabe, T.

The E. coli auxotroph containing the expression system for the protein of interest is grown in a rich medium such as LB or TB supplemented with glycerol,31 to a high cell density (OD600 > 1.0). Typically, at 37 ° and 2 liters of culture this will take 6-10 hr. The cells are harvested by centrifugation and washed in minimal medium to remove traces of the original medium. The cells are transferred to 1 liter of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) casamino acids, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaC12, and 100 mg of thiamin. This medium is devoid of Trp. Antibiotics are added to the medium after cooling, to the final concentration normally used for bacterial growth. The growth step in rich medium is used to attain a high cell density in a short period of time. After washing and resuspension into minimal medium a further growth period of 1 hr is advised to deplete any residual Trp that may be present in the medium or within the cells. The medium is then supplemented with 20-50 mg of L-analog or 40-100 mg of DL-analog and recombinant protein expression induced by the addition of isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG). One-Step Method. Trp auxotroph cells containing the expression plasmid are grown in M9 minimal medium as described for the two-step method but supplemented with 2% (w/v) casamino acids, glycerol (20 ml/liter) as a carbon source, and L-Trp (4 mg/liter). The cells are then grown to a constant OD600, usually for 15-18 hr, until the Trp is depleted. The growth medium is not changed and the analog supplement is added directly to the medium immediately before induction of protein expression. This method has some advantages in comparison with the two-step method. One is the avoidance of the intermediate harvesting step. The second is that in the T7 promoter system T7 lysozyme is produced by the pLysS plasmid. Processes such as harvesting cells may damage cells, liberating T7 lysozyme that is produced by this expression system, 32 and this causes further cell lysis. E s t i m a t i n g Levels o f I n c o r p o r a t i o n o f T r y p t o p h a n A n a l o g s into Proteins The main concern when preparing analog-incorporated protein is the level of incorporation: the relative amounts of analog and L-Trp within the protein. Incorporation of Trp analogs by an in vivo method has an inherent degree of unpredictability, which can relate to the growth conditions, protein expression system, and in some cases the position of the Trp residue within the protein. In addition, it is important to remember that the cells will selectively utilize residual Trp in preference to an analog. For these reasons, it is essential that the relative levels of

analog incorporation must be estimated. A number of methods have been described to achieve this objective. These include spectral analysis, using "basis set spectra" in the linear combination of spectra (LINCS), and amino acid or peptide analysis following protein hydrolysis and subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry. In this section, we describe the use of these methods together with their respective advantages and disadvantages. Before a detailed analysis of the amino acid content of an analog-incorporated protein is undertaken, spectral characteristics of the purified protein may provide a qualitative estimate of the degree of incorporation. 1. Absorption spectra: Analogs such as 5HW and 7AW have a red-extended absorbance shoulder in comparison with Trp. When levels of analog incorporation are high, an absorbance shoulder between 300 and 320 nm is clearly visible. 4-Fluorotryptophan (4FW) does not have a red-extended absorbance shoulder, but the absorbance peak is blue shifted relative to that of Trp, owing to a ~,max of 260 nm for 4FW. If incorporation is high, then a shift in the absorbance maximum may be observed. 2. Fluorescence emission spectra will show changes characteristic of the incorporated analog, relative to the native protein. For example, proteins containing 5HW can be excited at 310 nm and a fluorescence maximum at 335 nm is evident. Alternatively, a protein into which 4FW has been incorporated, when excited at 295-300 nm, will show negligible fluorescence at 340 nm. 3. Phosphorescence spectra of the analogs are characteristic for the incorporated analog and may be observed. 25,32 However, this generally requires lowtemperature samples. 4. Near-UV circular dichroic (CD) spectra can also be useful, as 5HW and 7AW show signals that extend to 320 nm. The estimation of the aromatic amino acid content of proteins from their absorbance spectra in comparison with the absorbance spectra of the aromatic amino acids was proposed by Edelhoch 33 and Wetlaufer. 34 This involved measuring the fluorescence and absorbance spectra of the protein under denaturing conditions (6 M guanidine hydrochloride). In a similar way the Trp and analog content of the protein can be estimated by comparison of the protein spectrum with the spectra of various model compounds under the same conditions. The spectra of model compounds such as N-acetyltryptophanamide (NATA) and N-acetyltyrosinamide (NAYA), and t-BOC(~-amino)7AW, constitute the basis set spectra. The absorbance spectrum of the analog-containing protein in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride is measured and the analog content of the protein is estimated

by deconvolving a linear combination of the basis set spectra. 33-36 This method relies heavily on knowing the extinction coefficients of model compounds accurately and determining whether they are good representations of the same aromatic groups when incorporated into proteins and in the denatured proteins. The general method for determining the amino acid content of proteins and peptides uses acid hydrolysis of the protein, followed by chromatographic separation and detection of a colored or fluorescent adduct. Experience has shown that such traditional methods of amino acid analysis of proteins are not appropriate for tryptophan because it is inherently acid labile. Alternative methods use base hydrolysis 37'38 or nonoxidative acid conditions that do not degrade Trp, such as with methanesulfonic acid. 39 The resulting hydrolysate is lyophilized and resuspended in an appropriate buffer for HPLC analysis using a reversed-phase column. The aromatic amino acids can be identified by their retention time and by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. This precludes the necessity of a secondary reaction to label the amino acid with a dye. Zhang et al. 39 quantified the incorporation of 4FW into arginyl-tRNA synthetase by performing base hydrolysis and monitoring the elution of aromatic amino acids by absorbance at 280 nm. Concentrations of Trp and 4FW were calculated from the areas under the retention curves, after calibration with a known amount of each sample. A linear relationship was found between the peak area and mass of Trp or 4FW in the 100- to 1000-ng range. 4FW was found to have replaced 95% of the Trp in the arginyl-tRNA synthetase. Another report, using a similar method of alkaline hydrolysis, determined the 5FW content of glutathione transferase to be greater than 95%. 40 Another method uses electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) to quantify the relative amounts of analog versus L-Trp in a recombinant protein. Analysis of rat parvalbumin mutant F102W(5HW) by ESMS gave two peaks, one 16 mass units (m.u.) above that for the F102W protein, corresponding to the addition of a hydroxyl group in the analog-containing protein. 41 Fluorinated Trp-containing rat parvalbumin mutants showed an additional peak at m / e +18 as a result of the addition of a fluorine atom. The unit mass difference between Trp and 7AW is not sufficient to differentiate the two amino acids in the proteins by this method. The fraction of the analog-containing peak in relation to the L-Trp protein peak provides an estimate of the percentage analog incorporation. Using this method, the percentage incorporation of fluorinated analogs into rat parvalbumin F102W was found to be 71-77%. 41 The 5HW-containing protein showed 34.6% incorporation. 41

Analog Incorporation and Protein Stability
A traditional way of introducing a fluorescent reporter probe, other than Trp, into proteins is by covalent attachment of a chromophore to cysteine or lysine residues. Numerous chromophores have been developed for this purpose, and are coupled with amine, sulfhydryl, or histidine side chains in proteins. Such probes have been of great value, but the effect of their size and properties on the protein structure and function is a continual concern. The incorporation of Trp analogs has proved an attractive alternative because it is usually assumed that they minimally perturb the protein structure. In this section, we review some of the more recent studies investigating the effects of various Trp analogs on protein structure and function. A series of studies conducted with staphylococcal nuclease have characterized the effects of analog incorporation on the thermal stability of the protein and its fragments. 25'32'42-45They reported that the effect of analog was dependent on the mutant studied and the position of the Trp residue within the protein. The melting points of the proteins examined are summarized in Table II. Wild-type staphylococcal nuclease has a single Trp residue at position 140, and the V66W mutant has two Trp residues at positions 140 and 66. V66W' is a

C-terminal truncated fragment of the wild-type nuclease containing a single Trp residue at position 66. Previous studies have shown the V66W' fragment to be a marginally stable structure, such that the degree of secondary and tertiary structure retained by the protein is highly dependent on amino acid substitutions. 45,46 Trp140 is located within the C-terminal ot helix of the protein, whereas Trp-66 is situated within the/3 barrel hydrophobic core region in the N-terminal region. 32 5HW was not found to perturb the thermal stability of the wild-type protein, whereas it significantly destabilized both V66W and the V66W' fragment. Substitution of 5HW at positions 66 and 140 in V66W did not appear to alter the overall thermal stability of the protein, but did result in an increased degree of cooperativity in the unfolding process. 7AW was found to perturb the stability of the wild-type protein and of the V66W and V66W' mutant proteins. All three proteins were reported to be partially unfolded, retaining only the/3 barrel structure of the L-Trp-containing proteins. The alteration in protein structure was explained by the potential of the polar imino group at position-7 of the aromatic ring of 7AW to form hydrogen bonds with other amino acids. The natural environment of the indole side chain of the Trp residue would not be expected to accommodate a hydrogen bond acceptor at position-7. The fluorinated Trp analogs appear to have a small effect on the thermal stability of the proteins. This effect appears to be dependent on the protein studied. The rat parvalbumin mutant, FI02W, has a single Trp situated within the hydrophobic core of the protein. The thermal unfolding curves of F102W, F 102(7AW), and F102(5FW) are shown in Fig. 4, and melting points for the analog incorporated proteins are shown in Table II. Substitution with 7AW or 5HW resulted in a dramatic decrease in the melting temperature of the protein, indicative of a change in structural stability. This is evident from the shift in the midpoint of the thermal

denaturation curve shown in Fig. 4. All fluorinated derivatives were observed to have a stabilizing effect on rat parvalbumin (RP) F102W. Fluorine has a covalent radius only slightly larger than that of hydrogen (1.35 and 1.2/~, respectively) and therefore should not have any large volume effect. Wong and Eftink studied the partition coefficients of the Trp analogs and the results indicated that the fluorinated derivatives are slightly more hydrophobic than Trp itself. 32 This may be the origin of the stabilizing effect observed in the fluorinated RP mutant proteins, where the Trp residue is located within the hydrophobic core of the protein.

New A p p l i c a t i o n s Broos et al. presented the use of 7AW as an intrinsic chromophore for membrane proteins in vesicles and in live E. coil cells. 47 Purification of membrane proteins is inherently difficult, involving solubilization, purification, and reconstitution into proteoliposomes. Such purifications can alter the functional and oligomeric states of the protein and interactions with other membrane proteins. In addition, the reconstituted proteins are not unidirectional, complicating the analysis of ligand interactions in the protein. Using Trp auxotrophic cells, 7AW was incorporated into the E. coli membrane protein mannitol permease. The alloprotein was estimated to represent 10% of the total bacterial membrane protein. Production of inside-out (ISO) vesicles gave a functional alloprotein that had no reported differences in mannitol phosphorylation activity. The addition of mannitol to L-Trp protein resuited in an 8% increase in fluorescence intensity. Under the same conditions the 7AW protein gave a 28% reduction. In living cells addition of mannitol resulted in a 5% decrease in 7AW fluorescence, indicating that the procedure may be useful for the study of membrane proteins in vivo. Another application of analog-incorporated proteins was presented by Soumillion et al., 48 in which they investigated the subunit association and dissociation of the T4 bacteriophage gene 45 protein. This protein functions as a sliding clamp in the DNA polymerase holoenzyme, markedly increasing its processivity. The gene 45 protein is a homotrimer and it is unclear whether subunit exchange occurs and what role this may play in the loading and unloading of the enzyme from DNA. The so-called "loading" of gene 45 protein (g45p) on the DNA is an ATP-driven reaction catalyzed by the gene 44/62 protein complex. The authors presented a new example of using Trp analogs in proteins to study protein-protein interactions. They utilized the covalent label N-(acetylaminoethyl)-8-napthylamine-l-sulfonic acid (AEDANS), attached to a cysteine residue inserted at position-162, at the g45p subunit interface, in close proximity to Trp-91 within

the associated subunit. Subunit association and dissociation were monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from Trp-91 in one subunit to the AEDANS in the adjacent subunit. Addition of gene 45 protein with 4FW replacing Trp-91 led to a decrease in the fluorescence of AEDANS, suggesting that subunit exchange in solution was occurring, forming trimers containing 4FW-45 and V162C-45. The nonradiative properties of 4FW abolished the resonance energy transfer to AEDANS. The use of both covalently labeled protein and analog-incorporated protein provided evidence of subunit exchange in the trimer. They were able to show that although subunit exchange in gene 45 protein does not participate in the mechanism of DNA loading, it may facilitate gene 45 protein disassembly from DNA. The photophysical properties of both TAW and 5HW have been extensively characterized. The group led by Sengupta 49-51 has proposed the use of 5-hydroxyindole (5HI), the chromophoric moiety of 5HW, as an extrinsic probe of membrane and protein structure. The fluorescence maxima of 5HI and 5HW are insensitive to the surrounding environment. This solvent insensitivity has been explained by a significant energy separation between the two low-lying 7r-zr* singlet electronic states, La and Lb, that occur in indoles. The Lb state, a solvent-insensitive transition, lies below La in the hydroxyindole, so that fluorescence results exclusively from the L b state. This separation also results in 5HI having a high intrinsic anisotropy when it is immobilized. The potential of 5HI as an extrinsic anisotropy probe for membranes and proteins has been examined. 5HI was incorporated in unilamellar liposomal membranes, where an r value of 0.16 was reported at 25 ° in comparison with a solution value of close to zero. 51 The temperature dependence of 5HI anisotropy within the liposomal membrane exhibited a sigmoidal shape characteristic of the thermodynamic transition of the phospholipid from the gel-to-liquid crystalline states. The transition temperature obtained from this data was consistent with previously reported values. 5HI has also been proposed as a probe of protein structure, using the highly characterized protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein. It is well known that BSA and its human homolog HSA have at least one indole-binding site. The presence of two Trp residues in BSA has hampered spectroscopic characterization of this site. The anisotropy of 5HI was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of BSA, producing a characteristic hyperbolic curve with the plateau region of constant anisotropy corresponding to a 1 : 1 stoichiometry of BSA : 5HI. Use of the analog 5HI has proved a useful alternative. The binding constant was found to be 106 M -1.51

The technique of in vitro translation relies on the suppression of amber codons by tRNAs aminoacylated with nonnatural amino acids. 52-6° Rothschild and Gite 6° reviewed the technique of site-directed nonnative amino acid replacement (SNAAR). Essentially, the concept involves the use of chemically aminoacylated tRNAs that correspond to stop codons inserted at specific sites within the target DNA sequence. The tRNA used has the anticodon corresponding to a specific stop codon and will thus insert the nonnatural amino acid at that point in the mRNA. This "read through" of the stop codon is the process known as suppression and can be accomplished through the use of the corresponding suppressor tRNA. 54'6°~3 In E. coli the suppressor codons used are TAG (amber), TAA (ochre), and TGA (opal). The overall approach is illustrated in Fig. 5. In brief, the suppressor tRNA is aminoacylated with the nonnatural amino acid. The method that has been used to place a fluorescent nonnatural amino acid on the suppressor tRNA involves the chemical acylation of the 5'-terminal dinucleotide of the tRNA, CA, with the fluorescent analog. This is followed by an enzymatic ligation of the labeled oligonucleotide to a truncated suppressor tRNA. This has been demonstrated with 7AW, 58 5HW, and an e-dansyllysine. 58,64 The misacylated suppressor tRNA is then added to the in vitro protein translation system, or in vivo if the misacylated tRNA can be readily introduced into cells. 65 The suppressor tRNA is then directed during protein synthesis to the inserted stop codon on the mRNA and the nonnatural amino acid is incorporated into the nascent polypeptide chain.

All three amino acid analogs were chemically ligated to a suppressor tRNA molecule (tRNA~A). The limited spectral analysis carried out indicates that the dansyl fluorescence in dnsLys-fl-galactoside corresponded well with the emission spectra reported for dansyl fluorescence of proteins that have been nonspecifically posttranslationally modified. Table III shows the yields of protein obtained from the cell-free synthesis of fl-galactosidase using suppressor tRNA aminacylated with phenylalanine, 5HW, 7AW, or e-dansyllysine.

Although this technique has huge potential for site-directed incorporation of nonnatural amino acids, including fluorescently labeled amino acid analogs, the major drawback at the present time is the low yield of protein. Chemical Synthetic Methods An alternative to the molecular biological approach is the total chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins. Theoretically, this would allow complete flexibility as to the type and site of residue incorporation. In addition, chemical synthesis of peptides can yield large quantities of protein. 69 In this way small peptides containing 5HW 65,7o and 7AW 12'23 have been produced. Peptide synthesis using commercially available Trp analogs requires their conversion to the t-Boc(a-amino) derivative. Coupling may then be accomplished by standard solid-phase or solution synthesis. 65,69 5HW is commercially available as the L-form, and therefore synthetic peptides contain pure L-5HW. 7AW is commercially available as a Du-racemic mix, requiring the separation of the diastereomeric peptides. A number of methods have been explored to resolve the enantiomers of 7AW or effect total chemical or enzymatic synthesis of the pure

Complete chemical synthesis of a Ras-binding peptide (RBP) containing N l-methyl-7-azatryptophan has been reported. 73 Drawing on innovations in peptide chemistry74,75 multimilligram amounts of proteins up to 20 kDa in size have been produced of sufficient quality for structural studies. 76,77 The RBP was synthesized as a series of N-terminal peptide fragments, from which the full-length protein was constructed by native chemical ligation. 73 Structurally, the synthetic protein was not distinguishable from the recombinant protein, using far-UV CD. The chemically synthesized RBP was found to interact with Ras in the same manner as the recombinant protein.

This method can be used for the incorporation of a diverse array of fluorescent labels, with the prerequisite that they have a reactive group, and are stable to the conditions under which the peptides are synthesized. O t h e r F l u o r e s c e n t A m i n o Acid A n a l o g s Although 5HW and 7AW are by far the most commonly used amino acid analogs and have certain advantages in their spectral properties, it would still be worthwhile to have fluorescent amino acids with additional unique fluorescent properties. The use of constrained analogs of the aromatic amino acids is reviewed in McLaughlin and Barkley.78 These have not proved amenable to biosynthetic incorporation into proteins. Other fluorescent probes that are currently available have desirable spectral characteristics, such as long-wavelength fluorescence maximum, high quantum yield, and simple photokinetics, but cannot be incorporated directly into the amino acid chain of proteins because of the lack of an amino acid moiety. The synthesis of a new, nonproteogenic amino acid has been described, based on 2-arylbenzoxazoles, a group of fluorescent compounds with long-wavelength absorbance and higher quantum yield than Trp. The result, [2-(1H-indol-3-yl)benzoxazol-5-yl]-L-alanine (Fig. 6) has an absorbance maximum in polar and nonpolar solvent in the range 310-320 nm, with a molar extinction coefficient of 20,000 M -1 cm -1.79 The emission maximum of the fluorophore

in methylcyclohexane was 340 nm, and 360 nm in methanol. The quantum yield is solvent sensitive, 0.77 in methanol and 0.57 in methylcyclohexane. The high quantum yield and its increase with solvent polarity is consistent with the findings for this fluorophore without the amino acid moiety.8° It is also reported that these probes are photostable. It is predicted that this probe will be incorporated into proteins by virtue of the amino acid moiety. If this is to be performed in vivo, studies of the recognition by the cellular protein synthesis machinery are clearly essential. If the chromophore is not recognized by the alaninyl-tRNA synthetase and the cognate tRNA cannot be charged then an alternative method of protein incorporation will be required. In addition, there is no information regarding the cellular toxicity of such compounds to E. coli cells, or their uptake by such cells. A large number of Trp analogs have been synthesized, as shown in Fig. 1. Although a number of these have useful photophysical properties and can be biosynthetically incorporated into proteins as probes of structure and function, a number of analogs remain untested. The Trp analog 6-azatryptophan (6AW) has been shown to have a significant absorbance at 325 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 9800 M -l cm -1 81; however, its fluorescence properties had not been previously investigated. The clear spectral maximum of the absorbance of 6AW would provide a window for selective excitation at its absorbance maximum. We have investigated the photophysical properties of 6AW and the parent chromophoric moiety 6-azaindole (6AI). 8° In a preliminary investigation we have shown that 6AW is readily incorporated into proteins, using a single Trp mutant of the calcium-binding protein, calmodulin, as a model protein.8° The absorbance spectrum of 6AW, shown in Fig. 7, with a high extinction coefficient maximum at 325 nm, initially interested us in the analog as a spectral probe. In protein systems, when one of the protein partners in a proteinprotein complex has a large number of Trp residues the selective excitation of the other partner can be problematic. The sum of the Trp absorbance on the red edge of the spectrum can become significant and make the selective excitation of an analog in the protein partner difficult. The advantage of analog incorporation is then lost. The absorbance spectrum of 6AW initially suggested that it could be used to circumvent this problem. The fluorescence properties of 6AW were also promising, having a large quantum yield in water and an emission maximum considerably shifted from that of Trp, at about 400 nm. The fluorescence and absorbance properties of 6AW and 6AI are shown in Fig. 7. Initial photophysical studies showed the absorbance and fluorescence properties of both 6AW and 6AI to be acutely pH dependent. Figure 8 shows the absorbance and fluorescence spectra of 6AI in solutions of selected pH. Both exhibited isobestic points in their absorbance spectra, indicative of a ground state 80S. M. Twine,L.

We have proposed the equilibrium to be between the N6 protonated and unprotonated forms, as shown in Fig. 9. More detailed studies have shown the photophysics of 6AI to be complex, with possible excited state proton transfer reactions. 6AI has some potential as a sensitive probe of localized protein structure, reporting on the presence of proton-accepting or -donating groups.

In S u m m a r y
In vivo methods of incorporating nonnatural amino acids into proteins have several advantages: (1) the technique may be readily applied to an existing E. coli expression system by simple transformation of the expression plasmid into a Trp auxotrophic strain of E. coli; (2) protein yields are usually high, although generally slightly lower in comparison with expression of the L-Trp protein; (3) little or no modification of the protein purification techniques is required; and (4) specialized

equipment is not required in a laboratory that routinely uses recombinant protein expression. The biosynthetic approach does, however, have certain disadvantages: (1) 100% incorporation of the Trp analog at a particular site is not ensured; (2) the method is generally restricted to proteins containing only a few Trp residues because all Trps are replaced; and (3) the method is restricted to the few analogs that can successfully replace Trp in the cellular biosynthetic machinery.

Concluding Remarks Advances in genomic sequencing, including the sequencing of the human genome, has led to expanded activity in the area known as proteomics. New protein-protein interactions are being uncovered and their role in cellular processes are of extensive interest. The use of biosynthetically incorporated Trp analogs in the study of interaction of new protein partners would be a distinct advantage. The laboratories of Szabo and Ross first demonstrated the incorporation of a 5HW into recombinant proteins in vivo, using E. coli Trp auxotroph cells. 2°,21 Since that time a number of advances have been made in the incorporation of Trp analogs into proteins and their use in the study of protein structure, function, and dynamics on protein-protein interactions. The number of researchers using this concept to study the systems of interest is increasing. A summary of studies of using analog-incorporated proteins is shown in Table IV. The search for new fluorescent Trp analogs and the characterization of their photophysical properties is a research area of merit.
