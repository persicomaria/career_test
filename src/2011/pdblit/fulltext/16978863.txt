Abstract--Through a comparison of X-ray co-crystallographic data for 1 and 2 in the Chek1 active site, it was hypothesized that the affinity of the indolylquinolinone series (2) for Chek1 kinase would be improved via C6 substitution into the hydrophobic region I (HI) pocket. An efficient route to 6-bromo-3-indolyl-quinolinone (9) was developed, and this series was rapidly optimized for potency by modification at C6. A general trend was observed among these low nanomolar Chek1 inhibitors that compounds with multiple basic amines, or elevated polar surface area (PSA) exhibited poor cell potency. Minimization of these parameters (basic amines, PSA) resulted in Chek1 inhibitors with improved cell potency, and preliminary pharmacokinetic data are presented for several of these compounds.

Despite their inherent toxicity, DNA damaging agents continue to remain central in clinical cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, strategies directed at improving their therapeutic index are warranted. Following DNA damage, normal cells arrest and attempt repair at the cell cycle checkpoint G1, via the tumor suppressor protein p53, and at G2 and S via the checkpoint kinase Chek1.1­3 Tumor cells, however often are deficient in the G1 checkpoint due to loss of p53 function (estimated 50­70% of all cancers) and thus, must rely on the checkpoint kinase Chek1 to induce arrest at the S and G2 phases for survival. These p53-deficient cancers should be more vulnerable to Chek1 inhibition which results in abrogation of DNA-damage-induced arrest and

premature progression into mitosis resulting in mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. To summarize, abrogation of the S and G2 checkpoints should sensitize cancer cells to DNA damaging agents in p53-deficient backgrounds without enhancing toxicity toward non-malignant cells. As such, Chek1 inhibitors4 have the potential to widen the therapeutic window for clinically utilized DNA damaging agents in p53-deficient tumors. Through comparison of the inhibitor-bound crystal structures (Figs. 1 and 25) of ATP-competitive HTS leads

afford (E)-methyl 2-amino-5-bromocinnamate 4 in 95% yield. Quinolinone formation was effected by intramolecular cyclization of 4 in ethylene glycol at 200 °C to yield 6-bromo-quinolinone 5.12 Treatment of 5 with POCl3 gave chloroquinoline 6. Regioselective deprotonation13 was accomplished by LDA and the resulting anion reacted with 1-chloro-2-iodoethane to provide the 3-iodo-quinoline 7. Hydrolysis of 7 gave 6-bromo3-iodo-quinolinone 8. Suzuki coupling of 8 with Boc-protected-indolyl boronic acid afforded indolylquinolinone 9.14 Removal of the TBS group, followed by oxidation with Dess-Martin Periodinane yielded aldehyde 10. Reductive amination with various amines in the presence of NaBH(OAc)3 afforded 11. Deprotection of the Boc group, followed by Suzuki coupling with various boronic acids gave indolylquinolinones 13. Unsubstituted indolylquinolinone 2 has moderate Chek1 inhibitory activity15 (IC50 = 144 nM). Through positional scanning on the quinolinone with a CN group, compound 17 (Table 1) confirmed that C6 was the optimal locus for potency enhancement (>30-fold potency increase over 2). Furthermore, conversion of the nitrile 17 to the amide 18 resulted in an additional 6-fold enhancement of potency. Despite the intrinsic potency of 17 and 18, these Chek1 inhibitors exhibited only weak activity in our cellular checkpoint escape assay16 (CEA) which measures a compound's ability to release H1299 tumor cells from Camptothecin-induced cell cycle arrest. It was suspected that the presence of two basic amines at the C5 0 position of the indole compromised cell permeability.17 Evaluation of the piperidine derivative 19 revealed not only that cell potency could be dramatically improved18 by removal of one of these basic amines, but that the primary amine in 17 was not contributing to intrinsic potency. With the discovery of the cell potency-enhancing C5 0 piperidine, a more detailed exploration of the quinolinone C6 SAR was conducted. A set of 6-substituted-5 0 -piperidinyl-indolyquinolinones was prepared (Table 2). With a bromide handle, Suzuki

16 and 2 with Chek1, it was hypothesized that placement of substituents at C6 of the indolylquinolinone (2) would best mimic the potency-enhancing C6-CN in 1. This substitution was envisioned to fill a hydrophobic pocket (HI),7 which is adjacent to the Chek1 ATP-binding site that has been utilized by others.8,9 In this paper, we report the synthesis, preliminary structure­activity relationship and pharmacokinetic properties of 6-substituted indolylquinolinones. Another report has appeared that shows an alternative path for optimization of this series for Chek1 via C4 substitution.10 Indolylquinolinone analogs were prepared using the general reaction sequence shown in Scheme 1.11 4-Bromo-2-iodoaniline reacted regioselectively with methyl acrylate in a microwave promoted Heck-coupling to

coupling and copper-mediated Ullmann coupling reactions19 were used to survey potential groups. Amides and 5-membered ring heterocycles such as 21­28 provided Chek1 inhibitors with excellent potency against the enzyme, although some compounds (21, 27) again appeared to have compromised cell potency. Of particular interest was the pyrazole-containing inhibitor 22 which best balanced intrinsic and cell-based potency. A few phenols were also incorporated8,9 (30 and 31), yet these resulted in compounds with diminished potency. The general observation was made that potent ° inhibitors with high PSA (>100 A2)20 yielded poor cell potency, as in 21 and 27, possibly due to impaired cell permeability. PSA has been previously correlated to cell permeability21 and other drug transport properties.22 Experimental log P values for this series do not correlate well with the loss in cell potency and were within a `drug-like' range (i.e., log P for 22 = 2.81). An analysis of the binding mode of 22 allowed us to hypothesize as to the unexpected potency of polar substituents oriented toward the hydrophobic region I. Given that X-ray crystallographic structures cannot resolve hydrogen atoms, we postulate that the pyrazole in 22 hydrogen bonds to water in hydrophobic region I and helps to stabilize these moieties in the binding pocket. As can be seen in Figure 3,5 the pyrazole group of 22 can hydrogen bond to either of the front two water molecules, one of the acidic oxygens of Asp148, and the basic nitrogen of Lys38 (not shown) in addition to the backbone interactions made by this class of inhibitors (see Figure 2). Furthermore, an analysis of the limited SAR presented in Table 2 suggests the importance of correctly coordinating these water molecules with

H-bond acceptors (e.g., 21, 22, 25, 26, and 28). Removing the outer H-bond acceptor, as in 23, 24 or 29, leads to a decrease in potency. Following the selection of pyrazole as a suitable C6 substituent, efforts returned to the C5 0 indole position in order to further optimize potency and to begin exploring pharmacokinetics. Earlier efforts in this series23 indicated that this group was a primary site of oxidative metabolism and that improved PK profiles could be obtained through reducing its oxidative potential. Cell potency/ permeability was easily influenced by the character of this substitution, and again the trend was noted that high molecular PSA resulted in poor cell potency (i.e., 34, 35). The strategy that emerged was to combine potency enhancing groups at C6 and C5 0 that minimized PSA. Finally, the pharmacokinetic profile of these compounds was studied in dog (Table 3). Plasma clearance for compounds 22, 32­35 was moderate with half-lives ranging from 1.5 to 4.4 h. Clearance was improved with 36 by capping the pyrazole with a methyl group albeit with reduced potency. Considering cellular potency as well as PK profile, compounds 22 and 32 emerged out as lead compounds in this indolylquinolinone series. In summary, a series of potent Chek1 inhibitors were discovered based on comparison of the X-ray structure of ATP-competitive HTS leads 1 and 2 bound to Chek1. An efficient synthetic route has been developed to facilitate the SAR studies. A general trend was observed that compounds with multiple basic amines,

Chek1 inhibitory activity was measured using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay which measures phosphorylation of a biotinylated GSK-3 peptide as described in Barnett et al., Biochem J. 2005, 385, 399. For the construct, a naturally occurring exon 10 splice variant of human Chek1 described in patent application US20050266469(A1), containing primarily the kinase domain, was expressed in baculovirus with a C-terminal 6-histidine tag. This protein was purified on a Ni affinity column and used as it is for kinetic assays, or purified further on Heparin and SEC columns for crystallography. The Chek1 concentration was 0.5 nM and ATP was used at 0.1 mM. IC50 values are reported as the averages of at least two independent determinations; standard deviations are within ±25­50% of IC50 values. 16. NCI-H1299 lung carcinoma cells were arrested with 16-h treatment of camptothecin, and then treated with Chek1 inhibitors for additional 8 h. Checkpoint escaped mitotic index due to Chek1 inhibition was assessed by measuring the mitotic-specific phosphorylation of nucleolin in Chek1 inhibitor-treated cells using an antibody-coated, beadbased assay. In this assay, total nucleolin is captured on a streptavidin-coated paramagnetic bead coupled with biotinylated nucleolin monoclonal antibody 4E2 (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). Phosphorylated nucleolin is detected by an antibody complex consisting of a phospho-specific nucleolin monoclonal antibody TG3 (Applied NeuroSolutions, Inc.) and a ruthenylated goat anti-mouse IgM antibody labeled with ruthenylation kit (BioVeris Corp).

The electrochemiluminescent complex is quantified with BioVeris M-8 Analyzer. The EC50 of checkpoint escape mediated by Chek1 inhibition was determined with 10point series diluted Chek1 inhibitor-treated tetraplicate cell samples. 17. Chek1 inhibitors in another report also showed diminished cell potency and the authors also suspect cell permeability: Li, G.; Hasvold, L. A.; Tao, Z.-F.; Wang, G. T.; Gwaltney, S.

Note that Chek1 inhibitory activity is measured at Km for ATP (0.1 mM). In the cell assay, the ATP concentration is 2.0 mM resulting in an inherent 10-fold potency shift between these assays.
