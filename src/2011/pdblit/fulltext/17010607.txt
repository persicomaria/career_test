Therapeutic agents targeting the incretin axis are poised for clinical utility in the treatment of metabolic diseases. The incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide1 (GLP-1), plays a significant role in glycemic control. The focus here is on the maintenance of endogenous levels of GLP-1 by inhibition of its key degradative enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). DPPIV inhibition has been demonstrated clinically of value in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Speculation on its potential for the treatment of metabolic disease syndrome is also made.

Introduction
Diabetes is a major health problem and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in industrialized countries where one in ten adults will develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime. Over 150 million people worldwide have type 2 diabetes, an increase of 11% in the past 5 years, and this number is projected to rise to 300 million by 2025. The rising pandemic of type 2 diabetes is driven primarily by an increase in obesity among the young and the aging of the population. New therapies with novel mechanisms of action and improved tolerability are urgently needed to treat the growing diabetic population more effectively. Inhibition of DPPIV cleavage of GLP-1 is a highly validated target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Recently, several DPPIV inhibitors have entered

clinical development. These compounds are well-tolerated and published Phase Ib and Phase II data have established proof-of-concept in humans lending support to the idea that DPPIV inhibitors will be the next new class of oral antidiabetic drug. Metabolic syndrome is defined as a set of disorders characterized by insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia and high blood pressure and is associated with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Approximately 47 million U.S. adults have the syndrome. It has yet to be demonstrated whether or not a DPPIV inhibitor will have a beneficial effect on the treatment of metabolic syndrome.

Targeting DPPIV as a strategy to improve `incretin effect'
The enhanced secretion of insulin following oral versus intravenous glucose administration is known as the `incretin effect'. A major incretin hormone is glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1. GLP-1 is processed from proglucagon and released from enteroendocrine L-cells in the distal small intestine and colon in response to oral ingestion of nutrients. Binding of GLP-1 to its G-protein-coupled receptor on pancreatic b-cells increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [1,2]. In addition, GLP-1 stimulates insulin gene expression [3], induces pancreatic b-cell proliferation and islet neogenesis [4] and inhibits glucagon secretion [5,6]. GLP-1 slows gastric

Figure 1. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitors target the glucagons-like peptide (GLP)-1 pathway resulting in multiple antidiabetic actions. GLP-1 is a 30 amino acid peptide, which is secreted from entero-endocrine L-cells throughout the length of the small and large intestine. It is released into the bloodstream in response to the ingestion of food and has several antidiabetic actions. DPPIV inhibitors potentiate endogenous GLP-1 activity by preventing the cleavage of the N-terminal dipeptide leading to the inactivation of GLP-1.

emptying thereby reducing the rate of nutrient absorption [7,8]. GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in hypothalamic nuclei responsible for modulating feeding behavior. Peripheral administration of GLP-1 promotes satiety and inhibits food intake in humans [9,10]. Consequently, GLP-1 has multiple biological effects that contribute to glucose homeostasis and promote normalization of postmeal glucose levels (Fig. 1). Importantly, GLP-1 augments insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Unlike sulfonylurea drugs or insulin, enhancing endogenous GLP-1 levels does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Infusion of GLP-1 reduces postmeal and fasting glycemia in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [11­ 13]. Thus, GLP-1-based therapy has potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, active GLP-1 is rapidly converted to an inactive form by the cleavage of the aminoterminal dipeptide by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) [14,15]. The short half-life of GLP-1 in the circulation (<2 min) makes it impractical as a therapeutic agent and has led to the development of alternative strategies to enhance the antidiabetogenic activity of GLP-1. Lilly (http://www.lilly.com) and Amylin (http://www.amylin. com) are developing a lizard protein called exendin-4 (Exenatide) that has GLP-1 receptor agonist activity and is resistant to DPPIV cleavage [16]. Exenatide is effective in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in type 2 diabetics but is twice-a-day injectable with nausea as a prominent side effect. Another strategy to increase the circulating half-life of endogenous GLP-1 is to inhibit DPPIV activity [14]. DPPIV is capable of degrading another incretin hormone known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) [15]. GIP is a 42-amino acid peptide secreted by endocrine K-cells of the duodenum in response to ingestion of nutrients [17]. Like GLP-1, the physiological actions of GIP include glucose-dependent potentiation of insulin secretion and regulation of insulin gene transcription [17]. In contrast to GLP-1, glucose tolerance is not improved in type 2 diabetics

treated with exogenous GIP [18]. However, it has been reported that the response to GIP improves in diabetic patients treated with glyburide to reduce fasting glucose levels [17]. In this regard, hyperglycemic diabetic rats or normal rats made hyperglycemic by glucose clamp have decreased expression of pancreatic GIP receptor, which in turn causes a loss of insulinotropic response to GIP [19]. These data taken together support the notion that the initial effect of DPPIV inhibition in human diabetes is primarily by GLP-1 but raises the possibility that in the longer term, when glucose levels fall, treatment with DPPIV inhibitors could also improve the insulinotropic action of GIP.

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV
DPPIV is a postproline cleaving serine protease with significant homology to other alpha-beta hydroxylases. DPPIV is expressed as a glycoprotein on the surface of cells of most tissues and also exists in a soluble circulating form. In addition to cleaving GLP-1, DPPIV can play a role in the cleavage of other substrates with accessible amino-terminal Xaa-Proor Xaa-Ala-dipeptide sequences, resulting in their inactivation or alteration in their biological activities. Potential DPPIV substrates include growth hormone-releasing hormone, GIP, substance P, bradykinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, certain chemokines, stromal cell-derived factor, eotaxin and macrophage-derived chemokines [20]. Because of the several possible DPPIV substrates including chemokines, vasoactive peptides, neuropeptides and gastrointestinal peptides, concerns about the longterm safety of DPPIV inhibitors has been raised. However, although these peptides can be cleaved by DPPIV in vitro, very few appear to be physiologically relevant substrates in vivo. To date only GLP-1 and GIP have been validated as in vivo substrates of DPPIV in DPPIV knockout mice and DPPIVdeficient Fischer rats [21,22]. The importance of GLP-1 and GIP in the gluco-regulatory action of DPPIV inhibitors has recently been shown in double incretin receptor (i.e. GLP-1R

and GIPR) knockout mice where the glucose-lowering effect of DPPIV inhibitors is abolished [23]. DPPIV-deficient mice are healthy, have normal blood glucose levels in the fasted state but reduced glucose excursion after a glucose challenge [21]. GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulin levels are both increased in DPPIV KO mice compared to wild-type littermates. Similarly, DPPIV-deficient Fischer rats have a phenotype of improved glucose tolerance and enhanced glucosedependent insulin secretion [22]. Although DPPIV clearly regulates GLP-1 (and probably GIP) action in vivo, the DPPIV enzyme can have a broader role in metabolic control. In this regard, DPPIV KO mice show resistance to diet induced obesity with a concomitant reduction in adiposity compared to wild-type mice [24]. Consequently, long-term inhibition of DPPIV might have the potential to decrease body weight although this has yet to be demonstrated in human clinical trials.

DPP9 inhibitor caused alopecia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, enlarged spleen, multiple histological pathologies and death. In an acute dog study, the DPP8/9 inhibitor produced bloody diarrhea, emesis and tenesmus. The same toxicity was observed in both models with a DPPIV inhibitor (different chemotype) nonselective against DPP8/9 but was not observed with a selective DPPIV inhibitor [32]. Merck's DPPIV inhibitor MK-0431 has been reported to have greater than 2500-fold selectivity against DPP9 and DPP8 [33]. The DPP8/9 selectivity of other DPPIV inhibitors in the clinic has not been reported.

Recent clinical data for oral DPPIV inhibitors
At least five major pharmaceutical manufacturers are currently in human clinical trials with DPPIV inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Novartis (http://www.novartis.com) (LAF-237) and Merck (MK-0431) are in Phase III development. BMS (http://www.bms.com) (BMS-477118) and OSI Pharma (http://www.osip.com) (P93/01) are currently in Phase II and Glaxo SmithKline (http://www.gsk.com) (GSK23A) has entered Phase I (Fig. 2). Additionally, more than 15 companies have DPPIV inhibitors in preclinical development. Recently, human clinical data have been released on three compounds from two companies, Novartis and Merck (Table 1).

DPPIV inhibitors have the potential to be disease modifying
GLP-1 has trophic effects on b-cells [25]. Not only does it stimulate b-cell proliferation, it also inhibits apoptosis of b-cells [26]. GLP-1 is capable of enhancing the differentiation of new b-cells from pancreatic ductal epithelium [4,27]. DPPIV-mediated preservation of endogenous GLP-1 can also enhance the effects of GLP-1 on b-cell rescue/prevention of apoptosis. Indeed, chronic treatment with DPPIV inhibitors has been shown to preserve islet function in diabetic mice and to improve b-cell survival and islet cell neogenesis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [28,29]. It has been reported that humans with type 2 diabetes have a b-cell deficit probably because of increased b-cell apoptosis [30]. Consequently, by increasing GLP-1 levels, DPPIV inhibitors might be capable of providing new b-cells in patients with type 2 diabetes and thus, prevent the worsening of the disease. Furthermore, the treatment of impaired glucose-tolerant prediabetics with DPPIV inhibitors might delay or prevent the onset of diabetes. This would be a major medical breakthrough in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and possibly for impaired glucose tolerance. Although diagnostics are not currently available to directly measure b-cell sparing activity in the clinical setting, an apparent decrease in the rate of progression of type 2 diabetes has been observed with a DPPIV inhibitor in combination with metformin [31].

Efficacy established with DPPIV inhibition
NVP DPP728 was an early DPPIV inhibitor advanced into clinical trials. This modestly potent and shorter acting inhibitor was pivotal in establishing the utility of a DPPIV inhibitor in improving metabolic control [34,35]. The outcomes reported in the cited 4-week-study were both encouraging and provocative in demonstrating the feasibility of DPPIV inhibition for the treatment of early-stage type 2 diabetes. Patients with mild type 2 diabetes were administered NVP DPP728 two or three times daily for 4 weeks. A reduction in glucose levels measured at the end of the study determined that the glycemic control was improved and HbA1c levels were significantly reduced 0.6%. Interestingly, insulin levels

Selectivity of DPPIV inhibitors is important for safety
DPPIV is a member of a family of closely related enzymes that share DPPIV-like catalytic activity. Consequently, there is potential for adverse events or toxicity associated with nonselective DPPIV inhibitors. Profound toxicities in rodent and adverse side effects in dog have been reported with a DPP8/9 inhibitor. Merck (http://www.merck.com) scientists reported in 2-week rat toxicology studies that a selective dual DPP8/

were not significantly changed. To rationalize this apparent disparity between glycemic control and insulin levels, the study authors speculate that GIP and GLP-1 could have enhanced b-cell sensitivity to insulin, slowed gastric emptying or inhibited glucagon secretion. A minor reduction in lipid levels was observed, and adverse events were short-lived with continued therapy. This study showed the potential of DPPIV inhibition as monotherapy for the treatment of early type 2 diabetes. Novartis has recently turned to the development of a more potent longer acting DPPIV inhibitor, LAF237 (VildagliptinTM) [36,37]. The first study was similar in design to the one described above. Patients were dosed with LAF237 once daily for 4 weeks. DPPIV enzymatic activity was used as a biomarker and nearly complete abolition (98%) of enzymatic activity was observed 45 min after drug administration. DPPIV enzymatic activity remained low for nearly 12 h and then rebounded to approximately 60% of baseline activity after 24 h. GLP-1 levels were increased after 4 weeks of treatment both at baseline and postprandially. As observed with NVP DPP728, LAF237 also showed enhanced glycemic control resulting in an HbA1c reduction of 0.38%. Again as observed with NVP DPP728, there was no effect on insulin level. However, glucagon reduction with response to meals was reduced. Neither lipid profiles nor body weight changed significantly. No hypoglycemic events occurred, and other adverse events were sufficiently mild that no treatment was discontinued. Once again, the study demon146

strated the efficacy of a DPPIV inhibitor as monotherapy in the treatment of early type 2 diabetes with reduced levels of glucose and glucagon and stable levels of insulin, lipids and body weight.

Durability of treatment with DPPIV inhibition
Continued evaluation of LAF237 in combination therapy with metformin for up to 1 year has solidified DPPIV inhibition as a potential treatment for early-stage type 2 diabetics [31]. In brief, patients on stable metformin therapy received LAF237 for 12 weeks in addition to their continued metformin. Then approximately 90% of the patients agreed to participate in an extension study of 40 additional weeks. At the end of the 12-week-study, both fasting plasma glucose and prandial glucose levels were reduced in the DPPIV inhibitor and metformin group relative to metformin alone. HbA1c levels decreased by 0.7% whereas insulin levels, lipid profiles and body weight did not change significantly. At the end of the extension period, glycemic control was maintained in the LAF237 treatment group but had deteriorated in the metformin-treated control group. Prandial insulin for the LAF237 treatment group somewhat increased. Lipid profiles remained unchanged with the exception of a slight rise in total cholesterol, and body weight decreased very slightly. Control of body weight can be an important contribution of incretin modulation therapy. Certainly this study of patients receiving LAF237 and metformin gave a body weight neutral result. Similar cotherapy studies with the GLP-1 receptor

agonist, Exenatide (Byetta), and either metformin or sulfonylureas showed a dose-dependent sustained weight loss over the 30-week study period [38,39]. The adverse events reported with LAF237 and metformin 52-week cotherapy include some mild hypoglycemic episodes and one case of peripheral edema. Other reported adverse events were not believed to be drug related. With no deterioration in efficacy over time, the study authors suggest that the LAF237 and metformin cotherapy might be modifying the course of disease progression, but further studies are required to verify this.

Proof-of-concept in DPPIV inhibition with a novel chemotype
Merck has also advanced an orally active DPPIV inhibitor, MK-0431, with a novel chemotype into human clinical trials. Unlike the cyanpyrrolidines advanced by Novartis, the heterocylic portion of MK-0431 cannot interact covalently with DPPIV. Results of a proof-of-concept study have been released [40,33]. Type 2 diabetic patients participated in a three-period crossover study. After fasting, each patient received a single oral dose of either placebo or 25 mg or 200 mg of MK-0431 followed by an oral glucose tolerance test, 2 h later. Incremental glucose AUCs decreased, plasma insulin AUCs increased and glucagon decreased. Plasma C-peptide AUCs also increased and levels of active GLP-1 doubled. The lack of observed dose responsiveness was attributed to the study being conducted at or near the Cmax. Certainly, this study confirmed the potential of MK-0431 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

III studies in the fall of 2003 with exendin-4 (Exenatide), a peptide isolated from the Gila monster, a lizard native to Mexico and the southwestern United States, having DPPIVresistant GLP-1-like activity. Exentatide was given as twicedaily injections initially at doses of 5 mg for 1 month and then 5 mg or 10 mg per injection for 5 months. This regimen reduced the tendency to cause initial nausea. The average drop in HbA1c was 1%. At the 10 mg dose, 40­46% of patients achieved the target HbA1c level of <7%. Weight loss was observed over the 26-week-period. Antibodies against Exenatide were reported in 20% of patients, but this was unrelated to clinical efficacy [38,39]. The FDA approved Exenatide (Byetta) for combination therapy with metformin and sulfonylureas in April 2005.

Distinction between DPPIV inhibitors and GLP-1 analogs
Although DPPIV-resistant GLP-1 analogs represent a similar therapeutic approach as DPPIV small molecule inhibitors, there are significant differences between the strategies (Table 2). First, GLP-1 analogs are injectable whereas DPPIV inhibitors are orally available. Consequently, it is not probable that GLP-1 analogs will become first-line therapy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is probable that GLP-1 analogs will be used as add-on therapy to patients not achieving adequate control with combination oral medication but before the addition of insulin. By contrast, DPPIV inhibitors have the potential to be first-line therapy either as monotherapy or in combination with other oral hypoglycemic agents. Another distinction is that DPPIV inhibitors do not have a primary effect on GLP-1R agonism. Their effects are dependent on changes in the endogenous levels of incretin hormones and thus the pharmacodynamic response of DPPIV inhibitors is an amplification of the regulated release pattern of endogenous incretin hormones. Consequently, the level of GLP-1 achievable by DPPIV inhibitors is dependent upon Lcell secretory capacity. By contrast, GLP-1 analogs produce plasma concentrations of GLP-1R agonist related to basic principles of pharmacokinetics. Therefore, GLP-1 analogs can be dosed to achieve efficacious levels. This distinction

DPPIV-resistant GLP-1 analogs as an alternative strategy to enhance `incretin effect'
DPPIV resistant GLP-1 analogs represent biologics within a similar therapeutic approach. Both approaches, either discovery of a stable peptidic GLP-1R agonist or chemical modification of GLP-1 to enhance DPPIV resistance, increase GLP-1 receptor agonism and enhance insulin secretion in a glucosedependent manner and preserve b-cell mass and function in preclinical animal models [41].

can account for the ability of GLP-1 analogs to produce decreases in body weight, which have not been observed with DPPIV inhibitors. A third distinction relates to mechanism of action. Multiple mediators (e.g. GLP-1 and GIP) might contribute to the efficacy of DPPIV inhibitors. Consequently, DPPIV inhibition can result in a different clinical profile than that achieved with injection of a single hormone analog (e.g. GLP-1). Given these differences, it is reasonable to regard DPPIV inhibitors and GLP-1 analogs as related but distinct therapeutic approaches.

Conclusions
Metabolic syndrome is a multifaceted disease state characterized by combinations of high blood pressure, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Obesity is frequently associated with increased insulin resistance that can eventually move onward to diabetes. DPPIV inhibitors most probably represent the next pharmaceutical class emerging for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Either as monotherapy or as cotherapy, orally administered DPPIV inhibitors has shown durable glycemic control with limited side effects (Table 1). The question now becomes how and when to best use this new therapeutic class. Clinical trials have focused on early-stage type 2 diabetics. From some limited preliminary data, DPPIV inhibitors can actually exhibit type 2 diabetes disease-modifying characteristics. If DPPIV inhibition proves to be b-cell sparing, the disease modification potential would be impossible to ignore. Certainly, glycemic control is an absolute requirement that can be achieved with either monotherapy or cotherapy with a DPPIV inhibitor. It is encouraging that the glycemic control is achieved without hyperinsulinemia that can lead to vascular damage. Other aspects worthy of further investigation with DPPIV inhibitors include influence on satiety, lipids and body weight. With DPPIV inhibition, lipid profiles and body weight seem little changed in human clinical trials and at least can be considered neutral. Satiety has not been demonstrated perhaps because DPPIV inhibitors do not elevate endogenous incretin levels sufficiently to achieve this effect. Because of the lack of efficacy of current DPPIV inhibitors on insulin sensitivity, body weight and lipid levels, it appears that they do not have a profile that will have much impact in the treatment of metabolic syndrome. However, the knockout mice studies remain provocative with observed resistance to hyperinsulinemia and obesity. The resistance to obesity is accounted for by a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure [24]. Because DPPIV inhibitors are well-tolerated, orally Link

active, new class of agents with the potential for disease modification, clinical investigation into their utility for the treatment of at least some of the disorders that produce metabolic syndrome must occur.
