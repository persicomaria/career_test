Thiolane 1-oxides are analogs of the carbonyl substrates that bind to the alcohol dehydrogenaseNADH complex and are potent uncompetitive inhibitors against alcohol [Chadha, V. K., et al. (1985) J. Med. Chem. 28, 36-40]. The four stereoisomers of 3-butylthiolane 1-oxide (BTO) were separated by chiral phase chromatography. CD and 1H-NMR spectra identified the enantiomeric pairs. 1H-NMR chemical shifts were assigned on the basis of COSY spectra of both diastereoisomers and confirmed by HMQC spectra. Coupling constants were determined through one-dimensional decoupling experiments. NMR with chiral shift reagents, Eu(hfc)3 [europium tris[3-[(heptafluoropropyl)hydroxymethylene]-(+)camphorate]] or (R)-(-)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-R-methylbenzylamine, determined that the most inhibitory isomer is either 1S,3R or 1R,3S. The chemical shifts of protons in the thiolane 1-oxide ring were influenced by the whole structure and were not correlated with the computed Mulliken charges. X-ray crystallography at 2.1 and 1.66 Å resolution of the ternary enzyme complexes with NADH demonstrated that the absolute configuration of the most inhibitory (Kii ) 0.31 µM) stereoisomer is 1S,3R and the next best inhibitor (Kii ) 0.73 µM) is 1S,3S. The thiolane 1-oxide rings bind in the same position, in the substrate binding site, but the geometry of the complexes suggests that the sulfoxides are not transition state analogs. Significantly, the butyl groups of the two isomers are accommodated differently by flexible amino acid side chains adopting alternative rotameric conformations.

ABSTRACT:

Liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH,1 EC 1.1.1.1) is a major rate-limiting enzyme for metabolism of ethanol; however, the enzyme has broad substrate specificity, and its physiological roles are uncertain (Plapp, 1975; Plapp et al., 1984). Inhibitors can be used to map the topology of the active site and could be used to prevent the oxidation of methanol and ethylene glycol to their toxic acids (Theorell et al., 1972; Chen et al., 1981; Plapp, 1994). 4-Methylpyrazole is a potent inhibitor of ADH and may be useful as a therapeutic agent (Blomstrand et al., 1980). However, it is competitive against alcohol so that high concentrations of alcohol reverse the inhibition, which is in contrast to uncompetitive inhibitors that remain effective (Chadha et al., 1983). 3-Substituted derivatives of thiolane 1-oxide are unusually potent uncompetitive inhibitors, which bind to the enzymeNADH complex and could be transition state analogs (Chadha et al., 1985). They have two chiral centers, at S1 and C3, on the five-membered ring and consequently four

stereoisomers. Since the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket of the enzyme is chiral, one of these four stereoisomers would bind most tightly to the enzyme and should be most efficacious. The isomers of the most potent uncompetitive inhibitor in ViVo, 3-butylthiolane 1-oxide (BTO, Chart 1), were separated, and their configurations were determined by NMR and X-ray crystallography. The X-ray results show how a flexible enzyme binds similar ligands in different ways. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials.

The concentrated fractions were rechromatographed to confirm enantiomeric purity. The concentration of BTO was determined using UV spectrophotometry ( 210 in hexane ) 2100 M-1 cm-1, 222 in water ) 820 M-1 cm-1). Kinetic Studies. For kinetic studies, crystalline ADH was sedimented, solubilized in buffer, and dialyzed to remove ethanol. Inhibition of the forward reaction by mixed or separated stereoisomers was studied with varied concentrations of inhibitors against varied concentrations of ethanol (0.4-2 mM) with 1 mM NAD+ in 46 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7 and 25 °C. For inhibition studies of the reverse reaction, freshly distilled acetaldehyde (1-5 mM) and 0.1 mM NADH were used. The change of absorbance at 340 nm on a Cary 118C spectrophotometer was used to determine the initial velocities. Data were fitted to the equations for noncompetitive [V ) VA/[Km(1 + I/Kis) + A(1 + I/Kii)]] and uncompetitive [V ) VA/[Km + A(1 + I/Kii)]] inhibition (Cleland, 1979). The best fit was evaluated by comparison of the standard errors and variance. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. One-dimensional proton NMR, proton-decoupled, two-dimensional COSY, NOESY, and HMQC spectra were obtained using a Varian UNITY 500 pulsed Fourier transform spectrometer at 25 °C, except the spectra with 1 equiv of (R)-(-)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)R-methylbenzylamine were measured using a Bruker WM360 MHz spectrometer. Samples were dissolved in CDCl3 at a final concentration of several millimolar. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal reference. For the NMR with the europium chiral shift reagent, the Eu(hfc)3 concentration was increased stepwise in 0.01 equiv. NMR data were processed using a Varian NMR program. Computational Modeling. Four stereoisomers of BTO were built and energy minimized (Powell method) using the computer program SYBYL (Tripos Associates). Cartesian coordinates of various possible conformations were obtained by dynamic simulation at 700 K for 1000 fs with annealing to 200 K for 1000 fs. Snapshots at every 50 fs of one 10cycle simulation resulted in 500 coordinate sets. The Mulliken charge of each atom connected to the ring was calculated both by the semiempirical molecular orbital method (MOPAC program in SYBYL) and by the quantummechanical ab initio molecular orbital method (Gaussian program GAMESS; Schmidt et al., 1993). For ab initio charge calculation, the 6-31G basis set was used with PM3optimized Z-matrix coordinates. Several differently ringpuckered conformations of each stereoisomer were docked into the active site of ADH, and torsion angles for the butyl group were adjusted using the program O (Jones et al., 1991) in order to obtain the starting model that best fit the electron density maps. X-ray Crystallography. Crystals of the ternary complexes of ADH with NADH and stereoisomers of BTO were prepared by dialyzing about 1 mL of 10 mg/mL recrystallized horse liver enzyme against 10 mL of 50 mM ammonium N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonate buffer at pH 7 and 4 °C, with 0.66 mM NADH, 0.23 mM P1 or 0.76 mM P3, and gradually increasing concentrations of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Crystals formed after addition of about 12% diol, and a final concentration of 25% was reached in 8 weeks. The crystals were flash-frozen at 100

Data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993) and converted to F's using the program TRUNCATE in the CCP4 package (CCP4 Suite, 1994). The qualities of the final models were checked using the programs WHATIF and PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). The crystals for the complex with P1 BTO (1S,3R isomer) belonged to the monoclinic space group P21 with the following dimensions: a ) 49.93 Å, b ) 180.2 Å, c ) 86.79 Å, and ) 106.0°. Since the cell dimensions were significantly different from those of any previous crystal form of the horse liver enzyme, and there were two dimers in the asymmetric unit, the structure needed to be solved again. Molecular replacement using the program AMORE (Navaza, 1994) and the monomer of the refined horse liver structure (Ramaswamy et al., 1994) was used to obtain the starting model. Refinement was begun using the program XPLOR (Brunger et al., 1987), using rigid body refinement of the ¨ structure as a whole and then as dimers, as monomers, and as domains, which led to the NCS matrices. Data from 8.0 to 2.1 Å resolution were used for a cycle of positional, simulated annealing and temperature factor refinement, and the resulting coordinates were used to do a cycle of density modification and 4-fold averaging with DM (Cowtan, 1994). The maps were inspected using the program O (Jones et al., 1991) and clearly revealed the position of the NADH, a large number of waters, and the inhibitor. NADH and waters were added at this stage. After another round of refinement, several more waters and the inhibitor in the 1S,3S configuration were added, and the protein was refitted graphically. Another round of refinement with strict NCS led to an Rvalue of 22.6%, with an Rfree of 24.8%. The modeled BTO remained in the 1S,3S configuration. At this stage, we used the program REFMAC (Murshadov et al., 1996), which uses the philosophy of maximum likelihood of phases for refinement. The following steps were done in cycles: run PROTIN to prepare restraints for the refinement, use REFMAC with strict NCS restraints on all atoms to refine, calculate maps and average them with RAVE (Kleywegt & Jones, 1996), use ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993) to add or delete waters corresponding to one subunit, and generate all

Inhibition studies were performed with varied concentrations of inhibitors against varied concentrations of ethanol (0.4-2 mM) at 1 mM NAD+ in 46 mM sodium phosphate and 0.25 mM EDTA at pH 7 and 25 °C. The intercept inhibition constants, Kii, were calculated from the fit for uncompetitive inhibition (Cleland, 1979). The standard errors were 4-8% of the values.

Assays were in duplicate. Data were fitted with the program UNCOMP (Cleland, 1979).

four subunits. This was followed by several cycles of refinement with the same protocol, but applying tight NCS restraints only to the protein atoms and without averaging the maps, which led to an Rvalue of 19% and an Rfree of 23%. The maps showed that only a few side chains of residues on the surface have uncertain or multiple positions. The Ramachandran plot indicated that only the four Cys-174 residues are not in "allowed regions". This residue is ligated to the catalytic zinc and is known to have a strained conformation (Ramaswamy et al., 1994). Table 1 summarizes the data and refinement. A surprising outcome was that the refinement program (REFMAC) automatically changed the chirality of the modeled inhibitor from 1S,3S to 1S,3R in all four subunits.

The result was verified by starting again with either the S,R or S,S isomers, and in both cases, the refinement returned the S,R configuration. In contrast, a retrospective XPLOR refinement returned the input configuration. Data were likewise collected from flash-frozen crystals of the complex with P3 BTO (1S,3S isomer), but a crystal was found that belonged to the monoclinic space group P21 with the following dimensions: a ) 49.4 Å, b ) 180.4 Å, c ) 43.7 Å, and ) 107.8°, which are very close to the cell dimensions of the monoclinic form found at 4 °C. The structure was refined by the same procedure described for P1. A 1.66 Å resolution data set was also collected at the BW7B beamline at the EMBL DESY, Hamburg, mounted with an MAR image plate. The crystals had the same cell dimensions as the complex with P1. Refinement started with the refined model for the complex with P1 and proceeded by the same steps. In this case, the refinement retained the 1S,3S configuration. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Separation of Stereoisomers. The chromatographic separation of the isomers of BTO is illustrated in Figure 1. BTO was separated into only two peaks on Cyclobond III (Rcyclodextrin) chiral phase. The four enantiomers were separated with moderate resolution on a Chiralcel OB-H (cellulose tribenzoate) column using 0.5% 2-propanol in

hexane or 0.5% ethanol in hexane. [The resolution on Chiralcel OD-H [cellulose tris(3,5-dimethylphenyl carbamate)] was not as good.] The order of separated peaks on the Chiralcel OB-H column under different conditions was the same even though the patterns were different. The area under each peak was as expected for the racemic mixture. Interestingly, the first peak from Cyclobond III corresponds to the third and fourth peak on Chiralcel OB-H. The four enantiomers were obtained in pure form by sequential separation on two columns, developed under different conditions. Chiralcel OB-H is widely used for the separation of chiral sulfoxides. For phenylmethyl sulfoxide and alkyl p-tolyl sulfoxides, the (S)-(-) enantiomer elutes more rapidly than the (R)-(+) isomer using a solvent system of 2-propanol/ hexane or ethanol/hexane (Colonna et al., 1992). As will be demonstrated later, P1 is the 1S,3R isomer, P2 1R,3S, P3 1S,3S, and P4 1R,3R. According to the crystallographic results, P1 is the 1S,3R enantiomer, and P3 has the 1S,3S configuration. Thus, both 1S enantiomers of BTO are eluted earlier than their 1R enantiomers on the Chiralcel OB-H column. Inhibition Studies. The inhibition of ethanol oxidation by racemic BTO was best described as uncompetitive, with an intercept inhibition constant, Kii, of 0.56 µM. Inhibition of the reduction of acetaldehyde was noncompetitive (Kis ) 0.65 ( 0.07 µM and Kii ) 1.75 ( 0.15 µM). These results suggest that BTO binds preferentially to the enzyme-NADH complex and weakly to other forms of the enzyme, such as the enzyme-NAD+ complex. Each isomer of BTO also was uncompetitive against ethanol (Figure 2), but with very different inhibition constants (Table 2). 3-Substituted thiolane 1-oxides had higher affinities than tetramethylene sulfoxide itself (Kii ) 19 µM) because of the increased hydrophobic interaction in the extended substrate binding pocket and the side chain of the thiolane 1-oxides (Chadha et al., 1985). For the 1R isomers of BTO, however, the 3-butyl group did not increase the binding affinities as compared to that of unsubstituted

tetramethylene sulfoxide. The 1S,3R and 1S,3S isomers had 100- and 10-fold lower Kii inhibition constants (0.31 and 0.72 µM, respectively) than the 1R,3S and 1R,3R isomers (Table 2). These data indicate that the chirality and position of the butyl side chain have significant effects on binding affinities. CD Spectroscopy and the Cotton Effect. The CD spectra (Figure 3) of P1 and P2 of BTO showed mirror symmetry, as did those of P3 and P4. Thus, P1 and P2 is one enantiomeric pair, and P3 and P4 is the other. The Cotton effect around max of a functional group reflects the absolute configuration (Sandstrom, 1995). Cotton effects ¨ of ketone or exiton-coupled compounds have been intensively studied and can be applied to determine the configuration of chiral molecules (Lightner, 1994). However, it is difficult to predict the Cotton effects of sulfoxides. Mislow et al. (1965) observed positive Cotton effects for the alkyl Ssulfoxides. In hexane, max of BTO is about 210 nm, but in water, max is shifted to 222 nm. Positive Cotton effects were observed near the max of P2 and P4, which have the R configuration at sulfur. P1 and P3 had negative Cotton effects. Thus, the Cotton effects of the stereoisomers of BTO are opposite to those of the linear sulfoxides and reflect the overall structures. NMR Studies. 1H-NMR spectra (Figure 4) also showed that P1 and P2 is one enantiomeric pair and P3 and P4 the

other. Assignment of the proton chemical shifts was an especially interesting problem. One might expect that the deshielding effect of the sulfoxide oxygen would be larger than that of the lone pair of electrons. However, the chemical shifts of protons in the R position of a sulfoxide are very sensitive to the solvent and the whole structure of the molecule (Lett & Marquet, 1971). We arbitrarily named protons bound to the same carbon as Ha and Hb, where Ha designates the proton located more downfield than Hb. The assignment to carbon number was established through the connectivity of the COSY spectra (Figure 5). Resonance frequency assignments of protons attached to the ring carbons deduced from the COSY spectrum of P4 were consistent

with those obtained from the HMQC spectrum and with decoupling experiments (data not shown). Decoupling of 1H-NMR for P1 showed that 2H and 5H are coupled to a b each other. For P4, 2Hb and 5Ha are coupled to each other. These results are consistent with these closely coupled hydrogens being either syn to the SdO or anti; as it turned out, these hydrogens are anti. In principle, the conformations and diastereomeric configurations could be established from the coupling constants. The coupling constants of NMR resonances for P4 (Table 3) showed that  (dihedral angle) between 2Hb and 3H is closer to 0 or 180° than  is between 2Ha and 3H (based on Karplus relationship), since the 2Hb signal has a larger vicinal coupling constant (3J2Hb-3H ) 11 Hz) than the 2Ha signal (3J2Ha-3H ) 6 Hz). For a five-membered ring, however, the relationship between coupling constants and the dihedral angle would deviate from the standard Karplus relationship, and we could not confidently deduce  values between ring hydrogens from the coupling constants. We also tried to compute the average interproton distances from a series of NOE experiments with four different mixing times: 0.035, 0.095, 0.257, and 0.700 s. The NOE values (volume at zero mixing time) were obtained by extrapolation of the peak volume versus mixing time. The average interproton distance is computed from the relation that the ratio of NOE values is proportional to the ratio of the inverse of the sixth power of the distance. However, cross-peaks of NOESY spectra of P4 showed uncommon shapes, a complex mixture of positive and negative peaks, in short mixing times (e.g., 0.035, 0.095, and 0.275 s). Thus, the calculation of the volume of cross-peaks was very difficult, and the average interproton distances computed from the cross-peak volume were not reliable. Chiral shift reagents can be used to establish configuration if the reagent forms a defined complex with the compound. The oxygen atom of the sulfoxide moiety can make a hydrogen bond with (R)-(-)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-R-methylbenzylamine (Pirkle et al., 1982) and a coordinate bond

with the europium of the lanthanide shift reagent (Cockerill et al., 1973). Europium, like other rare earth ions, is known to make 8-fold or more coordination because of a large ionic radius and the availability of vacant orbitals to accommodate electron pairs donated by Lewis bases (Brecher et al., 1965). Therefore, the protons near the sulfoxide oxygen should be affected more than distant protons (Shapiro et al., 1971). Addition of Eu(hfc)3 resulted in band broadening and induced shifts (Figure 6). More shifted protons showed more severe band broadening. One-dimensional-NMR of P1 and P2 showed that adding either (R)-(-)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)R-methylbenzylamine or Eu(hfc)3 affected the 2Hb, 4Hb, and 5Ha signals more than the 2Ha, 3H, 4Ha, and 5Hb signals (Figure 7). For P3 and P4, 2Ha, 3H, 4Ha, and 5Hb signals shifted more than the 2Hb, 4Hb, and 5Ha signals. These chiral shift reagent data indicate that the chemical shift patterns of the two diastereoisomers are opposite with respect to each other, which are consistent with the data from the decoupling experiments. 2Hb, 4Hb, and 5Ha of P1 and P2 are the protons syn to SdO, whereas 2Ha, 4Ha, and 5Hb of P3 and P4 are syn to SdO (Table 3). These results show again that the chemical shifts of protons in sulfoxide compounds are very sensitive to the structure of the molecule and not obviously predictable. In determination of the absolute configuration of sulfoxide compounds using NMR, the most critical issue is whether the deshielding effect of the sulfoxide oxygen is larger than that of the unshared pair of electrons. Biotin sulfoxide and penicillin S-oxide are the most extensively studied sulfoxides. Harrison and Hodge (1976) and Kemp et al. (1979) determined the chemical shift values () of various derivatives of penicillin and cephalosporin. In their studies, 5H of the R-sulfoxide (syn to sulfoxide oxygen) has a smaller  than 5H of the sulfoxide (anti to sulfoxide oxygen). However, the -lactam has nitrogen and a carbonyl group in the fused ring and a carboxyl substituent at C3. Biotin also has a fused ring with two nitrogens and a carbonyl functional group, but not adjacent to the sulfoxide. Thus, it is more similar to thiolane 1-oxide. On the basis of the Jgem relation of biotin sulfoxide, Liu and Leonard (1979) concluded that the 4H (syn to oxygen) signal of the R-sulfoxide is more downfield than the 4H signal of the -sulfoxide. Thus, the decoupling studies and the NMR with the chiral shift reagent demonstrate that the pattern of actual chemical shifts of the protons adjacent to SdO in BTO is complex and could not be predicted from previous studies. Molecular Modeling and Quantum-Chemical Calculation. Table 4 shows that all the protons syn to the sulfoxide oxygen

of the stereoisomers of 3-substituted thiolane 1-oxide have more positive charge (less electron density) than the corresponding anti protons, regardless of calculation methods. Because the variation in electron density around a proton is the most important factor influencing its chemical shift, these calculations support the proposal that syn protons might be more deshielded than anti protons. The charge on 3H of the S,S isomer is significantly higher than that of the S,R isomer. The chemical shift of 3H is 2.08 ppm in P1 and 2.85 ppm in P4. Therefore, P1 would correspond to either the R,S or S,R configuration on the basis of calculated charges of 3H, even though the deshielding effect of the sulfoxide oxygen or unpaired electrons on 3H might be much smaller than that for 2H or 5H, through both bonds and space. However, the calculated electron density could not predict the relative chemical shifts of 2H and 5H consistently. The chemical shifts of protons attached to the ring are determined by the overall conformation and sum of shielding or deshielding effects of the induced magnetic field due to the 3-butyl and sulfoxide groups. Structures of Ternary Complexes. The electron density maps of the ternary complexes of enzyme and NADH with the BTO isomers in P1 or P3 clearly showed that sulfurs have the S configuration (Figure 8). Both the 1S,3R and 1S,3S isomers appeared to fit quite well to the 2.1 Å electron density map of the enzyme-NADH-P1 complex. However, refinement showed that P1 was the 1S,3R isomer. The distance between sulfoxide oxygen and the zinc atom in active site is about 2.2 Å. Tables 5 and 6 and Figure 8C show that the binding modes for 1S,3R and 1S,3S isomers are different. The butyl group of the 1S,3R isomer points toward Leu-309 and Met-306 of the other subunit (labeled L709 and M706), whereas the butyl group of the 1S,3S isomer points to Leu-116. Furthermore, the side chains of Leu-116, Ile-318, and Met-306 (M706) and Leu-309 (L709) of the adjoining subunit have different rotamer conformations in the complexes with the different isomers. The structures of the protein moieties in the two different complexes studied at 100 K are very similar to the structure of the enzyme complexed with NAD+ and pentafluorobenzyl alcohol studied at 278 K (Ramaswamy et al., 1994). All have the "closed" conformation. The CR atoms of the subunits of the enzymes complexed with the sulfoxides can be superimposed on the subunits of the enzyme complexed with NAD+ with pentafluorobenzyl alcohol with average rms differences of 0.27 Å. The small differences appear in loops containing residues 33, 57, 134, and 246. The four subunits in the asymmetric units of the complexes with the 1S,3R

and 1S,3S isomers are also very similar, as the rms differences in the CR positions are 0.08 or 0.09 Å, respectively. The structures of the subunits of the complexes with the 1S,3S isomers in the two different unit cells are also similar (rmsd of 0.16 Å). The different packing of subunits in the complexes with NADH and the sulfoxides does not appear to significantly affect the tertiary structures. The most tightly bound stereoisomer might resemble the transition state for hydrogen transfer (Wolfenden, 1972; Tapia et al., 1988). However, the sulfoxides appear to be rotated about 90° from a position where a hydride ion could be transferred directly from NADH. Interestingly, the sulfur interacts with the benzene ring of Phe-93, in what may be considered to be a "cation-" interaction (Dougherty, 1994). The charge on the sulfur, as calculated with SYBYL and GAMESS, is about +0.9, and the charge on the oxygen is about -0.7. The distance from the positively charged sulfur

to the center of the electron-rich  ring is about 3.4 Å, which is close enough to stabilize the binding. This cation- interaction appears to be important in the determination of the binding mode of the sulfoxide inhibitors. The structure of the complex with dimethyl sulfoxide has an almost identical geometry (Al-Karadaghi et al., 1994). These structures provide a basis for modeling the binding of other inhibitors and reaction intermediates. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. William R.

a The torsion angles in all four subunits are about same (within (5°). The electron densities for the side chains are usually very well-defined, and the temperature factors are comparable to those for other atoms in the molecules. For the complex with the S,R isomer, the average temperature factor for the whole molecule was 16.9 ( 6.3. In the complex with the S,S isomer, the average temperature factor was 14.1 ( 5.5, and all residues had factors within this range, except Leu-116, which averaged 21. b Leu-57 of subunit C has a different value for 2 of 174, and the electron density suggests alternate conformations in all four subunits. c These residues belong to the other subunit of the dimer.
