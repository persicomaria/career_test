CopA, a P-type ATPase from Bacillus subtilis, plays a major role in the resistance of the cell to copper by effecting the export of the metal across the cytoplasmic membrane. The N-terminus of the protein features two soluble domains (a and b), that each contain a Cu(I)-binding motif, MTCAAC. We have generated a stable form of the wild-type two-domain protein, CopAab, and determined its solution structure. This was found to be similar to that reported previously for a higher stability S46V variant, with minor differences mostly confined to the Ser46 -containing 3-strand of domain a. Chemical-shift analysis demonstrated that the two Cu(I)-binding motifs, located at different ends of the protein molecule, are both able to participate in Cu(I) binding

and that Cu(I) is in rapid exchange between protein molecules. Surprisingly, UV­visible and fluorescence spectroscopy indicate very different modes of Cu(I) binding below and above a level of 1 Cu(I) per protein, consistent with a major structural change occurring above 1 Cu(I) per CopAab. Analytical equilibrium centrifugation and gel filtration results show that this is a result of Cu(I)-mediated dimerization of the protein. The resulting species is highly luminescent, indicating the presence of a solventshielded Cu(I) cluster. Key words: Bacillus subtilis, copper-mediated dimerization, copper trafficking, cysteine thiol, luminescence, NMR spectroscopy.

INTRODUCTION

Copper is an essential metal ion involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including oxygen transport, electron transfer, respiration, reactive oxygen species detoxification and pigment formation. Much of its usefulness in biological processes is based on its ability to cycle between oxidation states + 1 and + 2. This means, however, that it is also potentially highly toxic through the catalysis of reactive radical species formation. To counter this, organisms have evolved complex systems for trafficking copper from the point of cellular entry to its incorporation into the controlled environments of copper-containing proteins [1]. In general, these involve copper chaperone proteins, which appear to be highly conserved across eukaryotic and prokaryotic kingdoms [2,3]. We are interested in copper trafficking in Bacillus subtilis, the best-characterized Gram-positive bacterium, which contains an Atx1-like copper chaperone, CopZ [4­7], and a coppertransporting P-type ATPase, CopA [8­11], which co-operate as part of a copper-trafficking (export) pathway [12,13] that is regulated in response to Cu(I) by CsoR [14]. CopA is a 803-amino-acid-residue protein with eight predicted transmembrane segments and two N-terminal soluble domains (approx. residues 1­72 and 73­147) that each contain a conserved MXCXXC metal-binding motif typically found in homologous P-type ATPases and copper chaperone proteins [2,15]. These bear close resemblance in primary sequence to CopZ, and are involved in accepting Cu(I) from CopZ [12,13]. The solution structure of the second N-terminal domain of CopA (CopAb) was previously determined as a separate domain and as part of a twodomain protein [8]. These revealed almost identical ferredoxinlike  structures typical of this class of copper chaperones.

CopAa, either separately or as part of CopAab, was previously found to be unstable [8], but could be stabilized through the introduction of a single substitution, S46V, leading to structures of domain a, separately [10], and as part of CopAab, which also revealed a typical Atx1-like structure [9]. Here, we have generated a wild-type form of B. subtilis CopAab that is sufficiently stable for structural analysis, and we report the solution structure of the apo form of the protein, and a detailed spectroscopic and bioanalytical investigation of the Cu(I)-binding properties of the protein. Although the binding motifs of both domains are able to participate in Cu(I) binding, above a level of 1 Cu(I) per protein the protein undergoes dimerization, generating a highly luminescent species indicative of the presence of a solventexcluded multinuclear Cu(I) cluster.

EXPERIMENTAL Strains, growth media and genetic methods

Escherichia coli strains JM109 and BL21(DE3)pLysS (Promega) were used for cloning and expression respectively and grown at 37 C in LB (Luria­Bertani) broth [16], on LA plates [LB broth with 1.25 % (w/v) agar], or in M9 minimal medium (for composition, see the supplementary online data at http://www. BiochemJ.org/bj/411/bj4110571add.htm). Ampicillin, where appropriate, was used at a concentration of 100 mg/l. Molecular genetics techniques were used as described previously [16]. Plasmid DNA was isolated using commercial miniprep or midiprep kits (Qiagen). Chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis strain 1A1 (Bacillus Genetic Stock Center, Columbus, OH, U.S.A.) was isolated as described previously [17].

Cloning of B. subtilis copAab

A 473 bp fragment containing the 5 -part of copA (originally designated yvgX), encoding the two predicted soluble domains of CopA (a and b), was amplified by PCR, with the primers 5 -AAGGAGTGCATATGTTGAGTGAACAAAAGG and 5 -TTCTTTCTAGAAGCAGCCTAACTGTCCTG (where introduced restriction sites are underlined). The product was ligated into SmaI-cut pUC18, generating pTBNC1. The NdeI/XbaI fragment was ligated into pAlter-Ex1 (Promega) (containing a functional ampicillin resistance marker) and pET21a (Novagen) cut with the same enzymes, generating pTBNC7 and pCSNC1 respectively. The copAab gene fragment was confirmed in each case by sequencing (MWG Biotech).
Purification of CopAab

of Cu(I) binding by chemical-shift mapping, Cu(I) was added to 15 N-labelled apo-CopAab as above or as [(CH3 CN)4 Cu]PF6 [4] in a Coy chamber under a nitrogen atmosphere at 298 K; equivalent results were observed for each. Prior to all Cu(I) addition experiments, CopAab was treated with excess DTT under anaerobic conditions and subsequently buffer-exchanged to remove DTT.
NMR experiments and structure calculations

Typically, 2.5 litres (10 × 250 ml) of LB medium was inoculated with 10 × 1.5 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli JM109/ pTBNC7 and incubated at 37 C and 200 rev./min until the attenuance (D600 ) was  0.2, at which point IPTG (isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside; 0.4 mM) was added and the cultures were incubated with shaking for a further 4.5 h. Cells were harvested at 5000 g for 20 min at 4 C and resuspended in 0.1 culture volumes of 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.0). Lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) was added and the cells were incubated at 30 C for 15 min. DNase 1 (6 µg/ml) and RNase A (80 µg/ml) were added prior to sonication on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 39 000 g for 20 min at 4 C and the supernatant was heated slowly to 75C, stirred continuously for 15 min and placed on ice for a further 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 39 000 g for 20 min at 4C. DTT (dithiothreitol; 15 mM) was added to the supernatant and the solution was loaded on to a DEAE anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) and 15 mM DTT. A gradient of 0­1 M NaCl in the same buffer was applied and CopAab was eluted at  170 mM NaCl. The filtered protein solution was applied to a Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column, equilibrated with 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl and 15 mM DTT. CopAab-containing fractions were exchanged into 100 mM Hepes (pH 7) and dialysed against the same buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, to remove any traces of bound metal ions, and finally against the same buffer without EDTA. ICP-AE (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission) spectroscopy using a Varian Vista instrument showed that the protein contained less than 0.01 mol of copper, and no other metal ions. The purity of preparations was assessed by SDS/PAGE analysis and by ESI-MS (electrospray ionization MS; VG Platform). The molecular mass of CopAab was 15 911.6 + 3 Da, which compared well with the - expected mass of 15 913.0 Da. 13 15 15 C N- and N-labelled CopAab was purified by following the above protocol except that 10 × 250 ml of M9 minimal medium containing 13 C6 H12 O6 (4 g/l) and/or 15 NH4 Cl (1 g/l) was inoculated with 10 × 5 ml of a washed, overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pCSNC1 and incubated at 37 C and 200 rev./min until the D600 was  0.6. IPTG (1 mM) was added and the cultures were incubated for a further 7 h 30 min before harvesting.
Addition of Cu(I) to CopAab

NMR spectra were acquired on Avance 900, 800 and 500 Bruker spectrometers operating at proton nominal frequencies of 900.13, 800.13 and 500.13 MHz respectively. All the triple resonance (TXI or TCI cryo 5-mm) probes used were equipped with Pulsed Field Gradients along the z-axis. The NMR experiments used for the backbone and the aliphatic sidechain resonance assignment of apo-CopAab and for obtaining structural restraints are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 (at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/411/bj4110571add.htm). Resonance assignments of apo-CopAab have been deposited in the BMRB (BioMagResBank) database and are also presented in Supplementary Table S2 (at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/411/ bj4110571add.htm). All three- and two-dimensional spectra were collected at 298 K, processed using standard Bruker software (XWINNMR) and analysed with CARA software [18]. Structure calculations were performed using the program DYANA [19]. Stereospecific assignments were obtained with the program GLOMSA [20]. The elements of the secondary structure were determined on the basis of the chemical-shift index [21] and backbone NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) patterns. A total of 300 random conformers were annealed in 10 000 steps using the standard DYANA annealing protocol by using NOE and dihedral angle constraints. Restrained energy water minimization was then applied to the best 25 conformers from DYANA calculations, using the AMBER 8 package [22]. The NOE and torsion angle constraints were applied with force constants of 50 kcal · mol-1 · Å-2 (1 kcal  4.184 kJ; 1 Å = 0.1 nm) and 32 kcal · mol-1 · rad-2 respectively (rad is radiation dose; 100 rads = 1 Gy). The quality of the structure was evaluated using the programs PROCHECK-NMR, AQUA [23] and WHAT-IF [24]. Figures were prepared with the program MOLMOL [25]. The statistical and quality analysis of the REM (Restrained Energy Minimization) family of the apo-CopAab structure is reported in Supplementary Table S3 (at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/411/bj4110571add.htm). Atomic co-ordinates, structural restraints and resonance assignments for CopAab have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under ID code 2RML and the BMRB database under accession number 11011.
Spectroscopic and analytical methods

For spectroscopic and analytical studies, additions to CopAab were made using a microsyringe (Hamilton) in an anaerobic glovebox at 298 K. Cu(I) solutions were freshly prepared from analytical-grade CuCl (Sigma), in 1 M NaCl and 100 mM HCl [7]. As a control, we verified that addition of the acid solution alone to the protein did not itself cause any spectral changes. For studies

UV­visible absorbance spectra were recorded on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer or a Hewlett­Packard diode array spectrophotometer. CD spectra were recorded using an Applied Biosystems   180 spectrophotometer, with a slit width of 2 nm. Spectra presented are averages of 10 acquisitions and were corrected for intensity due to the buffer. CD intensity is expressed as molar ellipticity ([ ]) in units of deg · cm2 · dmol-1 . Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrophotometer at 25 C with ex = 276 nm and excitation and emission slit widths of 8 nm. For the measurement of emission in the region 500­700 nm, slit widths were set to 10 nm (with ex = 295 nm) and a 390 nm cut-off band pass filter was employed. Sedimentation-equilibrium experiments were performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge in an AN50Ti rotor

at 25C, in 12 mm charcoal-filled Epon double-sector cells with quartz windows. Protein samples were prepared and loaded into cells in an anaerobic glovebox. Data were acquired at 280 nm using the absorption optics. The sample volume was 110 µl and the reference sector of the cell contained identical buffer (100 mM Mops and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Samples of CopAab at two different concentrations containing 0, 1 or 2 Cu(I) ions per protein were spun at 17 000 and 20 000 rev./min until equilibrium was reached, as judged by cessation of changes in scans collected 4 h apart. Data were analysed using Ultrascan, version 6.1 [26]. The density of the buffer was taken as 1.005 g/ml and the partial specific volume of CopAab was calculated to be 0.7381 ml/g using the program SEDNTERP [27]. Analytical gel filtration of samples of CopAab containing 0, 1 or 2 Cu(I) ions per protein was performed using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated in thoroughly deoxygenated buffers and operated at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min.

Figure 1 1 H,15 N amide chemical-shift differences between wild-type apoCopAab and apo-S46V CopAab
Data are reported as weighted-average chemical-shift differences ( avg (HN)={[( H)2 + ( N/5)2 ]/2}1/2 , where H and N are chemical-shift differences for 1 H and 15 N respectively). Chemical-shift differences are not reported for residues 2, 17, 18, 19 and 86, as these residues are not observed in one of the pairs of the comparison.

Previous studies of the two N-terminal soluble domains of CopA (CopAab), which exhibit 40 % identity, revealed that the conformational stability of domain a is low and it was found to unfold within days following purification [8]. Stability was significantly increased by the introduction of a valine residue in place of Ser46 , facilitating structural studies [9,10]. In aiming to better understand the structural and Cu(I)-binding properties of wild-type CopAab, we noted that the previously studied CopAab protein was expressed in a His-tagged form from which the tag was removed, leaving a four-residue C-terminal extension, which could have affected its stability. The His-tagged form also required a quite different purification procedure to that employed for untagged proteins (see below), and these procedures may affect the stability of the resulting purified proteins to different extents. Therefore the 5 -end of the copA gene was recloned, expressed in E. coli and the corresponding non-tagged, wild-type protein, CopAab, purified to homogeneity. The 1 H­15 N and 1 H­ 13 C HSQC (heteronuclear single-quantum correlation) spectra of apo-CopAab showed well-dispersed resonances indicative of an essentially folded protein. Of the expected 143 15 N backbone amide resonances, 138 were assigned. The amide resonances were missing for residues Leu2 , Cys17 , Ala18 , Ala19 and Ala86 . Double conformations were observed for approx. 10 % of NHs mainly located in domain b, which were not observed for the S46V variant. After 1 month, the 1 H­15 N HSQC spectrum showed a significantly reduced number of peaks compared with the spectrum of a fresh sample. In particular, almost all peaks associated with domain a were missing, while those due to domain b were largely unaffected, with relatively few double conformations. Concomitant with the loss of domain a peaks was the appearance of new peaks with 1 H,15 N chemical shifts typical of unfolded residues. The latter behaviour was not observed in the S46V variant, whose 1 H­15 N HSQC spectrum remained unchanged for months. These results confirm that the wild-type protein is less stable than the S46V variant, as previously reported [8]; however, the stability of the CopAab protein generated here was sufficient to enable the structural characterization of the wildtype protein. A comparison between the NH chemical shifts of the variant S46V CopAab and the wild-type protein showed few differences. These are essentially grouped in the first domain, in particular in the region surrounding Ser46 , and in the first 30 residues (Figure 1). Chemical-shift index analysis on HA, CO, CA and CB resonances

and the NOE patterns indicated the presence of eight strands and four -helices, ordered in two consecutive  motifs, in agreement with the previously determined structure of the S46V variant. The solution structure of wild-type apo-CopAab was solved using 2623 meaningful upper distance limits, 169 angle constraints experimentally determined, and 24 proton pairs stereospecifically assigned. After water-energy minimization on each of the best 25 conformers of the DYANA family, the rmsd (root mean square deviation) of the mean structure (for residues 6­141) of the conformers of the family was 0.81 + 0.18 Å for the - backbone and 1.44 + 0.16 Å for all heavy atoms (Figure 2A). - The structure of the wild-type protein is very similar to that of the variant (the backbone rmsd between the two mean structures is 1.5 Å; Figure 2B), indicating that the substitution does not alter the overall fold of the protein. Thus the wild-type protein is organized in two closely packed domains with the same ferredoxin-like fold, spatially oriented such that the two Cu(I)-binding sites are far apart (Figure 2A). The two domains are linked through only two residues, Val72 and Thr73 , which connect the last strand of the first domain and the first -strand of the second domain. The orientation of the two domains in the wild-type protein is the same as that found in the variant (Figure 2B) and it is experimentally well determined by approx. 20 inter-domain NOEs between residues: 72 and 119; 119 and 121; 61 and 104; 119, 120 and 73; 61 and 73; 61 and 117; 11 and 121; and 58 and 103.
UV­visible absorbance characterization of Cu(I) binding to CopAab

Cu(I) binding to apo-CopAab under anaerobic conditions was investigated using UV­visible absorbance spectroscopy. This gave rise to high-energy absorbance bands, which are assigned to predominantly cysteine-to-copper [LM (ligand-to-metal)] CT (charge transfer) transitions [28]. Increases in intensity were observed in the near-UV region, becoming more intense as further Cu(I) was added (Figure 3A). Subtraction of the apoprotein spectrum from subsequent spectra revealed clear shoulders in the developing intensity at  255 nm and  292 nm (inset, Figure 3A). Plots of A255 and A292 as a function of Cu(I) added (Figure 3B) clearly showed the formation of distinct Cu(I)­CopAab species below and above a level of  1 Cu(I) per CopAab respectively. From 0 to 1 Cu(I) per CopAab, there was a linear phase (with 255 and  292 values of 3385 + 100 - and 235 + 25 M-1 · cm-1 respectively), while at a level of  1 -

Cu(I) per CopAab, the intensity in both the plots increased more sharply [  255 and  292 values of 13 100 + 500 and 5850 + - - 100 M-1 · cm-1 respectively at a level of 2 Cu(I) per CopAab]. The trend of the increases observed above a level of 1 Cu(I) was sigmoidal, indicating non-stoichiometric binding behaviour.
Fluorescence characterization of Cu(I) binding to CopAab

CopAab contains four tyrosine residues (and no tryptophan residues) that give rise to a fluorescence signal. The sensitivity of the fluorescence to Cu(I) binding was monitored by recording the emission spectra after each addition (Figure 3C). A plot of fractional fluorescence emission intensity at 306 nm (typical for tyrosine residue) as a function of Cu(I) added is shown in Figure 3(D). The fluorescence intensity was essentially unaffected in the range 0­1 Cu(I), but above this level, a significant quenching of intensity was observed. As observed for the UV­visible titration above, the fluorescence response above a level of 1 Cu(I) per protein was not linear.

Data from UV­visible spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that distinct binding events take place below and above 1 Cu(I) per CopAab. Given that a single molecule contains two domains, each with a Cu(I)-binding motif, the spectroscopic data could be interpreted in several ways. For example, Cu(I) could bind at one of the domains with a significantly higher affinity than at the other; the observation of a distinct break at a stoichiometry of 1 Cu(I) per protein would be consistent with such behaviour. Alternatively, a Cu(I) ion could bind at an inter-domain, intra-protein site, with thiolate ligands derived from the motifs of both domains. The structure of the apoprotein (Figure 2A) showed that the two motifs are far apart and cannot participate in such inter-domain binding without undergoing very significant structural reorganization. Thus NMR was used to further characterize the Cu(I) binding and to monitor the effects on protein conformation. 1 H­15 N-HSQC spectra of apo-CopAab and CopAab containing 1 Cu(I) per molecule are shown in Figures 4(A) and 4(B) respectively. The data demonstrated that major structural changes did not occur upon Cu(I) binding, but a number of resonances were observed to become broadened beyond detection or to shift significantly. Importantly, all of the assigned resonances due to residues Met15 -Ala22 and Glu82 ­Asn90 were lost or significantly shifted; these correspond to the Cu(I)-binding motifs of the two domains. The data indicated that both domains are involved in Cu(I) binding at a level of 1 copper(I) per protein. An identical loss of intensity associated with the Cu(I)-binding motif residues of both domains was observed upon addition of only 0.5 Cu(I) per CopAab (results not shown). This suggests the presence of exchange processes on a time scale comparable with, or slower than, the NMR chemical-shift range. Similar behaviour has been observed for other metallochaperone/P-type ATPase systems [29­ 31]. Because of the high affinities exhibited by these proteins for Cu(I), this must result from facile transfer of Cu(I) from one domain to another, and because of the relative position of the two domains in CopAab, we conclude that the copper exchange must occur between domains of different proteins. Following the addition of 1.5 and 2.0 Cu(I) ions per CopAab, the well-dispersed character of the 1 H­15 N-HSQC NMR spectrum was lost and only resonances in the 7.9­8.5/119­123 p.p.m. (1 H/15 N) region were observed (results not shown). This behaviour was consistent with either unfolding of the protein at higher levels

Dependence of CopAab association state on Cu(I)

To determine the effect of Cu(I) binding on the association state of CopAab, equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out. Data for apo-CopAab and CopAab containing 1 and 2 Cu(I) per protein respectively are shown in Figure 5(A) (upper panel). Fits to a single-component model, shown as solid lines through the data (with residuals plotted in the lower panel), gave molecular masses of 16.0 + 1 and 21.3 + 1 kDa for apo- - CopAab and 1 Cu(I)­CopAab respectively and 30.3 + 1 kDa for - 2 Cu(I)­CopAab. The mass of a single CopAab molecule is 15.9 kDa and so we conclude that apo-CopAab is a monomer, consistent with the structural data above. The 1 Cu(I)­CopAab exhibited a mass somewhat higher than that of the monomer, indicating that a small proportion of dimeric CopAab was present. The observed average molecular mass is actually an overestimation of the true average mass because the dimer species has a significantly greater 280 value than the monomer and therefore disproportionately contributes at A280 . Thus the exact proportion of dimeric Cu2 CopAab is difficult to determine accurately, but it must be relatively minor: a significant dimeric

component would require a double exponential function to fit the data. We estimate that the dimer represents <5 % of the sample, consistent with the analytical gel filtration results below. At 2 Cu(I) per CopAab, the protein was predominantly a dimer. The results clearly demonstrate that the changes in the spectroscopic properties above 1 Cu(I) per CopAab are associated with the dimerization of the protein. CopAab association states were studied further using analytical gel filtration chromatography. Figure 5(B) shows chromatograms of CopAab loaded with 0, 1 and 2 Cu(I) ions per protein. Monomeric apo-CopAab was eluted at 12.0 ml, while 1 Cu(I)­ CopAab was eluted at 12.1 ml, indicating that it remained monomeric at this copper loading, consistent with the analytical

ultracentrifugation results above. The shoulder observed at 11.25 ml in the elution profile may have arisen from partial oxidation of the protein in solution. At 2 Cu(I) per CopAab, a very different elution profile was observed, with the major elution peak shifted to 9.8 ml, consistent with the dimerization of the protein at this level of Cu(I) loading. We note that the 1 Cu(I)­CopAab sample exhibited a minor peak at 9.8 ml, indicating that a small proportion (<5 %) of dimeric CopAab was present, consistent with the analytical ultracentrifugation results above.

changes were observed in the range 2­4 Cu(I) per protein. This is shown more clearly in a plot of CD intensity at 221, 205 and 199 nm as a function of Cu(I) added (Figure 6B). Although spectra of CopAab containing more than 1 mol of Cu(I) per protein indicated a degree of unfolding, the protein still contained a significant component of secondary structure, as evidenced by a comparison with the spectrum recorded for apo-CopAab in 6.6 M guanidinium chloride solution (Figure 6A). We conclude that dimerization is accompanied by a significant conformational change.
Luminescence properties of CopAab on Cu(I) binding

To assess secondary structural changes on Cu(I) binding to the protein, a far-UV CD titration of CopAab was carried out. The spectrum of apo-CopAab (Figure 6A) was characteristic of a folded protein. The negatively signed band at 221 nm was consistent with the presence of a significant amount of helical structure, while the intensity ratio of the 221 nm band to the shoulder at 208 nm indicated the presence of a significant proportion of -sheet structure, consistent with the  structure presented above. The intense positive band with a maximum at 199 nm is also consistent with the presence of strand/helix secondary-structure elements. The initial addition of Cu(I) caused the intensity of all bands to decrease somewhat, but did not cause significant changes in the form of the spectrum. The intensity and form of the spectrum changed extensively, however, in the range 1­2 Cu(I) per protein: the 221 nm and 199 nm bands were significantly reduced in intensity and the intensity ratio of the 221 nm band to the shoulder at 208 nm (now shifted at 205 nm) was drastically changed. These spectral variations indicate a decrease of both -helical and strand content. In particular, the band shift from 208 to 205 nm is indicative of a shortening of the -helices. Only minor further

Up to a level of 1 Cu(I) per CopAab, excitation at 295 nm resulted only in emission intensity due to tyrosine fluorescence, as described above (Figure 3C). However, above 1 Cu(I) per protein, an increasingly intense emission band exhibiting a large Stokes shift was also observed in the  600 nm region of the spectrum, see Figure 6(C). Although mononuclear Cu(I) are known to luminescence, to our knowledge there are no examples in which mononuclear Cu(I) complexed within a protein environment gives rise to this behaviour. However, similar bands in this region exhibiting a large Stokes shift (which are generally described as luminescence bands) have been observed at room temperature for many proteins, including metallothioneins [28,32­34], Ace1 [35], Amt1 [36], Cox17 [37,38], CopY [39] and a synthetic fourhelix bundle protein [40]. Importantly, all of these proteins bind Cu(I) in the form of a multinuclear cluster. Furthermore, this behaviour is characteristic of a cluster that is in a solvent-shielded environment [37,38,41,42] where metal­metal interactions play an important role in stabilizing the emissive photoexcited state [43]. Importantly, the luminescent species was not observed until the Cu(I) loading was >1 per protein, see Figure 6(D). This also

corresponds to the dimerization of the protein, and we conclude that CopAab association leads to the formation of a solventshielded multinuclear Cu(I) cluster.

DISCUSSION

We generated a protein containing non-tagged, wild-type versions of both CopA N-terminal domains. Although domain a exhibited lower stability than domain b, as previously reported [8], it proved to be sufficiently stable to enable structural characterization and the analysis of its Cu(I)-binding properties. The increased stability of the protein generated here relative to that previously studied is presumably associated with the fact that the latter was generated as a His6 -tagged protein. Cleavage of the tag resulted in the wildtype protein with a four-residue (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) extension at the C-terminus. It is not clear whether the decrease in stability of domain a was due to the C-terminal extension itself, the difference in purification conditions, or both. The conformational stability of proteins is marginal and small differences are in some cases sufficient to promote unfolding. The high-resolution solution structure of CopAab, determined by NMR, showed that each domain of the protein adopts a  fold (Figure 2A) typical of Atx1-like copper chaperones and the N-terminal domains of their cognate Ptype ATPase transporters [1,44­46]. Only minor local differences were observed between the wild-type structure and that of the previously characterized S46V CopAab variant (Figure 2B), and these were found principally around Ser46 but also in the first 30 residues (Figure 1). Importantly, the two domains, which are connected by a linker of only two residues (Val72 and Thr73 ), are oriented such that their Cu(I)-binding motifs are at opposite ends of the molecule. Therefore the two motifs cannot participate in intra-protein, inter-domain Cu(I) binding, unless Cu(I) binding is accompanied by a significant conformational change. To investigate the Cu(I)-binding properties of CopAab, we employed a range of spectroscopic and bioanalytical methods. NMR chemical-shift mapping and far-UV CD studies revealed that the protein did not undergo major conformational changes on initial binding of Cu(I), and NMR data also showed that the binding motifs of both domains participated in Cu(I) binding at low Cu(I)/protein stoichiometries (Figure 4). Loss of signal intensity due to Cu(I)-binding motifs at a level of 1 Cu(I) (and below) per protein indicated that Cu(I) was in exchange between binding domains. The structural data showing that the binding motifs of the two domains cannot approach one another sufficiently closely to facilitate metal exchange demonstrated that this process must occur between proteins when less than 1 mol of Cu(I) is present. Simple Cu(I) binding to each of the domains of CopAab would be expected to result in a single linear phase in the range 0­2 Cu(I) per protein. This was not observed: UV­visible and fluorescence data (Figure 3) showed clearly distinct phases below and above a level of 1 Cu(I) per CopAab. Such behaviour could be consistent with Cu(I) binding at one domain occurring with a significantly higher affinity than the second domain, but this would require that binding to the two domains is fundamentally different in terms of spectroscopic characteristics. We discount this possibility because NMR data demonstrated that binding to both domains occurs at low Cu(I)/protein stoichiometries and therefore cannot occur with significantly different affinities. Furthermore, the residues predicted to be involved in Cu(I) binding in the two domains are identical and it would be highly unlikely that the mode of binding and, therefore, the spectroscopic signature associated with it would be very different.

To investigate whether the observed behaviour is related to the association state of CopAab, equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and analytical gel filtration experiments were carried out. These revealed that CopAab is monomeric in its apo form and remains monomeric in its 1 Cu(I)-bound form. Addition of further Cu(I) to 1 Cu(I)­CopAab induced dimerization, such that at a level of 2 Cu(I) per CopAab the protein is present exclusively as a dimer (Figure 5). Dimerization caused the loss of well-dispersed resonances in the HSQC NMR spectrum. This behaviour was also observed for the S46V CopAab variant under conditions of high Cu(I) loading, and was attributed to the association of protein monomers [9]. Interestingly, Ag(I) did not cause similar behaviour, leading to the suggestion that protein­ protein interactions in CopAab are driven by the co-ordination chemistry of Cu(I), consistent with the spectroscopic data reported here. Cu(I)-mediated dimerization has also been observed for similar systems, with homo- and hetero-dimers (B. subtilis CopZ [6,7], human Hah1 [47] and yeast Atx1/Ccc2a [45]). This phenomenon is observed for CopAab only when more than 1 mol of Cu(I) is added, indicating that occupancy of the binding sites of both domains is necessary to promote dimer formation. The interaction of the N-terminal soluble domains of CopA with CopZ involves the interaction of electrostatically complementary surfaces [12]. Homodimerization implies that non-complementary surfaces must approach one another, which appears to be unlikely on energetic grounds, but the formation of the multinuclear Cu(I) cluster can be the thermodynamic driving force for dimer formation. Indeed, it was recently shown that the driving force for protein­protein interactions between yeast Atx1/Ccc2a partners was Cu(I) binding; despite their electrostatic complementarity, apo-Atx1 and apo-Ccc2a do not form a complex [45]. Furthermore, the structure of dimeric Hah1 revealed that an extended H-bonding network between the two monomers, together with the shared Cu(I) ion, was sufficient to stabilize the dimer structure [47]. It is likely that a similar arrangement exists in other highly related homodimers, such as CopZ [6,7] and here in the case of CopAab. The structure of dimeric CopAab is currently unknown, but the intense luminescence signal at  600 nm associated with its bound copper strongly indicates the presence of a Cu(I) cluster in a water-excluded environment (Figure 6). Dimerization of CopAab could result in two Cu(I) dinuclear centres, with each located at an inter-protein domain interface. To achieve this would require structural rearrangements with respect to the apo form in order to position the cysteine residues close enough to allow formation of the two dinuclear centres. Significant structural rearrangement was observed by far-UV CD upon binding of >1 Cu(I) per protein (Figure 6), and little further change was observed above 2 Cu(I) per protein. Another possibility is that CopAab dimerization results in a single tetranuclear Cu(I) cluster, and there are numerous examples of protein-buried, highly luminescent Cu4 clusters [28,40,48]. However, the positioning of cysteine residues to accommodate such a cluster would require very extensive rearrangement of the domains of CopAab, and so the dinuclear Cu(I) centre model is currently favoured. Database searches reveal that there are many P-type ATPases with more than one N-terminal domain [15]. Among bacterial species, two domains is by far the most common arrangement, raising the question of what, if any, is the functional significance of this arrangement. Here, we have demonstrated that Cu(I) binding at levels greater than 1 per protein results in dimerization, raising the question of whether this too could have functional consequences. Thus it is an intriguing possibility that interactions between the N-terminal domains of different CopA molecules are
