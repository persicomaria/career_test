S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase as a target for intracellular adenosine action
Doris Kloor and Hartmut Osswald
Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tubingen, Wilhelmstrasse 56, D-72074 Tubingen, ¨ ¨ Germany

S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcyase) controls intracellular levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). AdoHcy is a potent product inhibitor of some S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases. Pharmacological modulation of AdoHcyase to indirectly inhibit methyltransferases can be guided by the fact that adenosine binds with high affinity to AdoHcyase and inhibits enzyme activity. cAMP can compete with adenosine and can counteract the adenosine-induced inhibition of AdoHcyase. Thus, the ratio between adenosine and cAMP, which can vary under different physiological conditions, might result in changes in, for example, DNA promoter methylation and therefore transcription. S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcyase; EC 3.3.1.1) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) to adenosine and homocysteine [1].

equilibrium of the reaction in vitro favors the synthesis of AdoHcy [2]. However, hydrolysis of AdoHcy to adenosine and homocysteine prevails under physiological in vivo conditions because both reaction products are removed rapidly. Adenosine can be deaminated by adenosine deaminase or enters the purine nucleotide pool by the action of adenosine kinase. Homocysteine can enter the trans-sulfuration pathway and be metabolized to cystathionine or can be re-methylated to methionine (Figure 1). The existence of multiple routes of metabolism of the precursors of AdoHcy [S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)] and products of AdoHcy metabolism (adenosine and homocysteine) is consistent with the necessity for efficient product removal to avoid AdoHcy accumulation because AdoHcy interferes with AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases by product inhibition. The inhibition of transmethylation reactions affects the efficiency of gene expression at several levels, including methylation of the promoters, cap formation, the stability and export of mRNA, and the initiation of translation. Thus, AdoHcyase

Figure 1. Pathway of intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), adenosine and homocysteine metabolism. The cytoplasmic enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of AdoHcy to adenosine and homocysteine. Under physiological in vivo conditions, hydrolysis of AdoHcy to adenosine and homocysteine prevails because both reaction products are removed rapidly by the actions of several enzymes. Adenosine can be deaminated to inosine by adenosine deaminase or enters the purine nucleotide pool by the action of adenosine kinase. Homocysteine can enter the trans-sulfuration pathway and can be metabolized to cystathionine by cystathionine b-synthase or can be re-methylated to methionine by betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) or by 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (METH). AdoMet, the precursor of AdoHcy, is derived from an ATP-dependent transfer of adenosine to methionine, catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is thus an essential enzyme that has an important role in the regulation of processes such as transmethylation, trans-sulfuration and purine metabolism.

is an essential enzyme that has an important role in the regulation of processes such as transmethylation [3], trans-sulfuration [4] and purine metabolism [5]. Because adenosine inhibits AdoHcy hydrolysis in vitro and in vivo, the metabolism of adenosine, AdoHcy and AdoMet are functionally interrelated. AdoMet, the methyl donor for most methylation reactions, is derived from an ATP-dependent transfer of adenosine to methionine. After transfer of the methyl group to cellular methyl acceptors, AdoMet is converted to AdoHcy, the common product of all AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase reactions. AdoHcy is a potent inhibitor of some methyltransferases that are susceptible to the inhibitory effect of AdoHcy [6]. Thus, the activity of methyltransferase reactions is dependent on the efficient product removal of AdoHcy, which is accomplished by AdoHcyase. It has been shown previously that in transcriptionally activated cells, during embryogenesis of Xenopus laevis, AdoHcyase can also be located in the nucleus. The nuclear localization of AdoHcyase, which coincides with high rats of mRNA synthesis, might reflect the necessity to remove AdoHcy to maintain the efficiency of transmethylation [7]. The crystal structure of AdoHcyase has been described recently by several groups [8 ­ 10]. Interestingly, the polypeptide folding pattern at the catalytic domain of AdoHcyase is almost identical to that reported for glycine N-methyltransferase [8]. Inhibition of AdoHcyase results in the intracellular accumulation of AdoHcy and thus potent inhibition of

some AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases [6,11,12]. The ratio of AdoMet:AdoHcy levels is used frequently as an indicator of cellular methylation capacity, whereby a decrease in this ratio predicts reduced cellular methylation potential [3,13]. Because AdoHcy inhibits most AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases by binding to the active site with a higher affinity than does AdoMet [14], the increased intracellular concentrations of AdoHcy might be more effective in reducing cellular methylation capacity than are decreased levels of AdoMet. Adenosine formation in the organism is enhanced when ATP hydrolysis prevails over ATP synthesis. The major site of adenosine production is assumed to be located in the cytosol, at least under hypoxic conditions [5]. However, adenosine can also be formed extracellularly via the breakdown of ATP that is released into the interstitium. Once released into the extracellular space, adenosine elicits a variety of cellular responses mediated through its interaction with G-protein-coupled adenosine receptors located at the surface of target cells [15]. The extracellular actions of adenosine are reviewed elsewhere [16,17]; however, limited information is available about the intracellular action of adenosine. Therefore, in this article, we focus on AdoHcyase and its regulation and modulation by adenosine. Interaction of adenosine with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase Mammalian AdoHcyase is a homotetrameric enzyme that contains tightly bound NADþ as a cofactor, with a ratio of

four mol NADþ per mol enzyme. The mechanism of action of AdoHcyase, in which a cycle of reciprocal oxidation ­ reduction of substrate and NADþ is involved, has been described by Palmer and Abeles [1]. Binding of adenosine to AdoHcyase induces the formation of a 30 -keto-adenosine, accompanied by the transfer of the hydride ion to NADþ to form NADH. At this stage of the catalytic cycle the enzyme is turned into a `closed' form [9,10]. The interaction of adenosine with AdoHcyase requires high in vitro concentrations of adenosine above 5 mM for subsequent NADH formation, which suggests that adenosine interacts with the catalytic site of the enzyme [18]. The fully oxidized enzyme in its NADþ form displays a single, low-affinity binding site for adenosine and only one peptide binding site was identified after labelling this form of AdoHcyase with azido-3H-adenosine (Figure 2) [18]. After the reduction of NADþ to NADH AdoHcyase is enzymatically inactive. The reconstitution of apo-AdoHcyase with NADH also leads to an enzymatically inactive enzyme that retains the ability to bind adenosine with high affinity [19]. Thus, adenosine binding to its high-affinity binding site does not require the conversion of the enzyme to its reduced form. When this reduced form of the enzyme was labelled with azido-3H-adenosine another peptide incorporated the azido-probe (Figure 2). Freshly purified AdoHcyase from bovine kidney that contains ,92% NADþ and 8% NADH [20] exhibits two adenosine binding sites with high and low affinity with a maximal capacity of 2 mol adenosine per mol enzyme [18]. From this purified AdoHcyase, two different photolabelled peptides were isolated that correspond to the two adenosine binding

sites. According to the crystallographic data [8] the lowaffinity binding site (NADþ form) appears to belong to the catalytic domain of AdoHcyase, whereas the high-affinity binding site (NADH form) is located in the NAD domain of the enzyme [18]. Thus, adenosine might be involved in the process of NADH-induced inhibition of AdoHcyase enzyme activity. Under pathophysiological conditions, such as hypoxia or tissue injury, or after administration of nucleoside analogue inhibitors of AdoHcyase or after administration of both adenosine and homocysteine, tissue levels of AdoHcy have been shown to increase significantly, leading to a substantial decrease of the methylation potential within the cell [21,22]. A reduced methylation potential as a result of prolonged exposure to homocysteine is associated with global DNA hypomethylation [23,24]. Changes in methylation potential affects expression of genes such as those encoding erythropoietin or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) [22]. In addition, it has been suggested that adenosine might act intracellularly to induce apoptosis. At present it is not clear to what extent adenosine mediates this action through adenosine A3 receptors [25] or through the reduction of methylation potential induced by AdoHcyase inhibition [26,27]. Interaction of cAMP with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase The second messenger cAMP mediates a wide variety of cellular responses to hormonal signals, including changes in intermediary metabolism, cellular proliferation and cellular motility. cAMP has traditionally been thought to act exclusively through cAMP-dependent protein kinase; however, a growing number of cAMP effects mediated by specific intracellular cAMP binding proteins are not attributable to general activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase [28,29]. As recently reported, AdoHcyase is also a cAMP binding protein that has a high-affinity binding site for cAMP. The fact that adenosine and adenosine analogues displace cAMP from bovine kidney AdoHcyase with equal potencies strongly favours the conclusion that the binding site for nanomolar concentrations of cAMP and adenosine in AdoHcyase appears to be identical [20]. Because the 30 -OH group of the ribose moiety of cAMP is blocked by the 30 ,50 -phosphate ester, the formation of the 30 -keto ribose in the catalytic centre of AdoHcyase cannot take place. Therefore, cAMP is unable to transform the tightly bound NADþ into NADH and, thus, prevents the induction of the closed form of the enzyme [20]. In contrast to adenosine, cAMP (5 mM) by itself stimulates the activity of AdoHcyase by 30% in the direction of hydrolysis [30]. Because cAMP and adenosine compete for the same binding sites in AdoHcyase, it is conceivable that stimulation of enzyme activity by cAMP is based on competition with adenosine at its inhibitory binding site. In fact, the adenosine-induced inhibition of AdoHcy hydrolysis by the purified enzyme can be antagonized by simultaneous addition of cAMP because cAMP decreased the adenosine concentration-dependent formation of NADH in a competitive manner [30]. Thus, the competition of adenosine and cAMP at the same binding site of the enzyme has functional implications.

The different peptides were identified using azido-3H-adenosine as the photoaffinity probe. AdoHcyase in its NADþ and NADH forms were incubated overnight at 4 8C with azido-3H-adenosine (30 mCi mmol21). After irradiation at 254 nm, the reaction mixture was dialyzed and digested with trypsin. The digests were separated by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the peptide peaks were collected. Fractions containing the highest radioactivity were sequenced by Edman degradation and the mass spectroscopic analysis was done by matrix-assisted laser desorption­ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS).

Concluding remarks Adenosine leads to the reduction of the tightly bound NADþ to NADH and to inhibition of the catalytic activity of AdoHcyase. Although adenosine and cAMP compete for the same binding site at the enzyme, they differ in their ability to reduce the enzyme from the NADþ form to its NADH form. Correspondingly, cAMP does not inhibit but rather stimulates AdoHcyase. These binding sites suggest that AdoHcyase might be modified by novel chemical entities.

I must congratulate Edzard Ernst for his extremely interesting article published recently in TiPS [1]. He has provided ample and comprehensive evidence that some Asian herbal medicines, in particular Indian and Chinese preparations, contain toxic heavy metals or undeclared prescription drugs, and these might constitute a serious health problem. In this article, I would like to draw

attention to herbal medicines in Malaysia. Nature has blessed Malaysia with an abundance of varied medicinal plants and, currently, Malaysia is among the world's 12 mega biodiversity-rich countries, in terms of number of plant species [2]. One of the most popular herbs in Malaysia is Eurycoma longifolia Jack, commonly known as Tongkat Ali [3]. This plant is a symbol of man's ego and strength because it has been claimed by the Malaysians to improve strength and
