Contrary to most scrinc protcinlrsc inhibitors. cgliu c rind Cl-2 luck disulfidc bridges for binding loop stabiliwtion, lnstcad, two ncighbouring nrgininc side chains (Arg-51.

the inhibitor is cleaved. but ut very low rates and with hydrolysis oscuring only at II sin& pptidc bond (tcrmcd the `scissilc bond'). The good inhibitory propertics (k, = 10'lo-lCt"l* M") result from tight binding with very slow r&ass of cichcr clcavcd or unclcuved inhibig tar. As already pointed out by McPhalcn ct al. [ 151. the comparison of frsc and complcxcd inhibitor mrry help to elucidate the rcasrns why thcsc molecules arc inhibitors rather than good substrates. It W~IS proposed [ 1S] that binding loop stabilization keeps the c;rrboxy=and amino=tcrmini of the clcnvcd bond in close vicinity, fascilitnting she resynthesis of unshved inhibitor by the cnzymc. A further important aspect is. that due to cntropical reasons higher binding loop rigidity is ascompanicd by a higher gain of tocal free energy upon binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme [l§], This results in a more tight complex, and hcncc higher inhibitory potency of the inhibitor. In casts whcrc disulfidc bridges flank the scissilc bond is is obvious chat binding loop stabilization muss always bc prcssnt, cvcn for the free inhibitor. ft is an interesting question whether this is also true for the non-covalent stabilizing sysccm provided by the core arsinincs in cglin c. 2.

AtIer a least-squares fit using the C, positions of the nmino acids 8-70 of both structures, the RMS deviation between till C, OCOIIIS was mlculatcd to bc 0.769 A. While the deviations for the core amino acids arc relativtly low. indicating chat the core is compact and cannot be easily distorted. the displacemcntfi in the binding loop region, espcoially for the Pl-, Pl'- and P2'-position, arc considerably higher (Fig. 2). Omitting thcsc three residues brings the RMS deviation for the remaining 60 Ca atoms down to 0.589 A.The chrec next largcat displaccmcnts (residues 18. 27, 59) were found in external loops, Intcrcstingly. the high displacement for the residue Gly-59 is accompanied by considcrabty better atomic ccmpcracurc factors and a flip of the pptide bscwccn this residue and the proceeding Pro-58 by 180* relative to the bound structure. The $. wangles for this pcptidc in free tghn c arc similar to those observed in the strusturc of cglin clsubtiliain Carlsberg reported by McPhalcn et al. [S] and cglin o/thcrmitasc rcporccd by Gros cc al. [8]. Table I presents the main chain #, ptorsional angles of the binding loop region of free cglin c and of cglin c in complex with several protcinascs, Data for free and bound CI-2 arc also shown. While the torsional angles, especially for the residues D3-Pl', arc quite similar for all the inhibitor/protsinasc complcxcs shown, the ryangle of the Pl-residue is significantly different in the structure of free eglin c with a change of =21 standard deviations from the mean calculated for 5 diffcrcnt structures of wild type and mutant cglin c in complex with subtilisin. While in complex with a protcinasc, the conformation of the cglin binding Loop is fixed by the surracc topology ofrhc active sire ofthc cnzymc. in ihc crystal structure of free cglin c this is done by crystal contacts.

c, In contest to what McPhalcn cc al. [ 15) reported for the free Cl-2. the reactive site binding loop of free cglin c is considerably better defined. Bxecpt for the first five amino acids, ull rrvcrngcd atomic tcmpcracurc factors (B-factors) for main chain atoms arc below 25 AZ. As cxpsstcd, chc highsst B-factor deviations rclativc to the bound structure have been obscrvcd for residues bclonging to the reactive site binding loop, especially for the Pl- and P3-residue, which arc very well defined in the bound structure. Bxscpt for McPhalcn cc al. [§I, who oould locate the residue &u-7, in all cglinlprotcinasc structures reported so far. the cglin structure was only detcrrninsd for the residues 8 to 70. The first 6 amino acids could not bs losatcd in any of the structures rcparred. In contrast, for free tglin all residues of the amino-terminal pcptidc segment from Thr=l to Leu-7 eun bc located, although with some degree of uncertainty as illustrutcd by high tcwpcroturc factors. The nmino terminus occupies the only large solvent region in the crystal between ncighbouring molecules, extending to the reactive site binding loop of un adjacent molcculc (Fig. cl), Except for a salt bridge formed between the side chains of Glu-2 and Arg-53*. no interactions can bc observed in the final model for chc first four amino acids which only have poorly dcfincd clsccron den&y. The N terminus of rccombinunt cglin c is asctylotcd; the ucctyl group also shows only weak clcstron density. As dsscribcd previously [25], no obvious anchoring points can bc located for the amino-terminal hcptapcptide of cglin. and according to methods of secondary structure prediction [24.27] this peptidc does not show a strong propensity for any spceific structural clement. Both considerations imply a high flexibility of the amino-terminus. which is consistent with structural fcacures observed for free cglin c. The averaged atomic temperature factors for the first five residues arc cxtrcmcty high (s 60 A$ As in bound cglin. the first amino-terminal amino acids which arc fixed to the cglin core belong to the segment Lysd-Phc-10, having intcrmain-chain hydrogen bonds to the carboxy-terminal segments Pro-67-Val-69. Exscpt for the ncptidc oxyacn atom of Scr-5, which forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Lys-8, all amino-terminal amino acids have no contacts to the eglin core and hence in solution may bc able to adapt any conformation compatible with steric restraints. leading to a high flexibility of the aminoterminus which makes it potentially nccsssiblc to protcinascs. According to the investigations of Bode et al, [25! with subtilisin and Pugliesc ct al. [28] with chymotrypsin. the amino-terminal pcptidc is cleaved bctwccn Glu-6 and bcu=7 or Lcu-7 and Lys-8, The clcavugc oxzurs at very low rates by free enzyme during formation ot' the crystaTs. Hcncc the iack ofihc nmino-fcrminul pcptidc cannot bc observed, neither in a fr&ly formed complex bctwccn eglin c and subtilisin 1251nor at any stage during the purifisation process used in our

In contrast, the binding loop of free cglin c shows siynificimt structurirl diffcrcnccs (Tirblc I and Fig. 3). In comparison to the complex structures. the core-binding loop intcructions are different in free eglin c.

The few obscrvcd rignific;rnt structurrll diffcrcnccs affect only side chains of &dues distributed on the surfxc of the cglin molcculc and urc caused by crystal contacts. In contrast. the trxmsi;ion from the free to the bound cglin struccurc is xcompunicd by iI concerted confornxrtionul change in ths binding loop. implying an induced ftt. lczding to the adaption of it struccm complcmcntury to the irsccsviblc cnrymc surfxc. This is in ngrcmcnc with the high flexibility of the reuctivc site binding loop observed by NMR investigations fl 11.Under complex or cyrrtcrl formution or both, only one of all possible binding loopconformutions is `fro;zcn out'. Mcncc what is obscrvcd in the crysttrl structures, is that conformation which hersadapted best co the lorxl cnvironmcnt dcf'incd by the enzyme surface topology or the position of crystal ncighbours. A further cxtrmplc for this induced fit mcchrrnism is the bending rrt `hinges' whcrc the loop cntcrs the core [ 101,which is obscrvcd when camporing different cglin/protcinnsc structures. Similar to tht frtc chymotrypsin inhibitor Cl-2 [ 151, binding loop stubilizaticrn provided by chc nryinincs is not fully prcscrvcd in the srystul structure of free cglin c. The clcctrostntic and hydrogen bonding interactions of the two protruding side chains of Arg-5 I and Arg-53 io the side chains of the Pl= and P2-rcuiduc arc lost. Only the hydrogen bonds to the main chtlin pcptidc oxygen atoms of these rcsiducs remain unchanged. This implies that the binding loop stabiliwtion provided by

the t'rpinincs can bc distorted cnsily (e.g. by crystal cantrrcts) and thut it may not ulways bc prcscnt in full strength, unless the binding loop ;rdrrpts to the surface topology of the cneymc upon formution of the complex, fnvcscigutions ilrc in progress in which the formation of specific core-binding loop intcructions is prevented by specifically designed mutrmts. Eurly results imply (hut binding loop stability affects the inhibitory propcrtics. but not the velocity of binding to the cnaymc, Morcover`, the chtulgcd binding loop stabilization obscrvcd in free c&in c may bc xcompunicd by higher loop Acxibilicy which allows the inhibitor to interact with ;I wider r;rngc of enzymes [31] and thus might bc an evolution= ary adwntup, albeit the higher flexibility leads to less tight binding to the cnzymc. The total free energy of chc system is reduced upon binding due to entropic reasons since chc flexible binding loop is fixed by the cnzymc in ti rigid position lcslding to 21 reduction of intcrnul dcgccs of conformutionrrl freedom. Howcvcr, the inhibition of cglin c towards subtilisin Curlsbcrg (,$ = 1.5 IO"' M")). bovine p;mcrciltic cr.chymotrypsin (/q = 27910"' M,`)l tend humun Icucocycc clastusc (k, = 1.510"`)' is quirc strong, nnd in cvolutionury terms, the flexibility to in= tcrxt with a wider range of enzymes of comptirirblc spscificity [311 might overcome this cncrgcticcll disadvancugc [IS). In the crystal structure of free cglin. the irmino-tcrminal hcptu-pcptidc is found in an cxrcndcd conformation. As prcdictcd [Xl. this pcptidc does no! sscm to htivc ti prcfcrcncc for 11 specific sccondnry struscurc and under ntrturnl conditions is most likely to be slblc to trdtrpt nny structural conformtrtion comptltiblc with s:cric rcstruints, While the long, floppy ctrrboxy tsrminus of unothcr low molcculur weight scrinc protcinusr: inhibitor from the leech Himrtu nvrticirdis (hirudinj is of specific functionrrl importtlncc in thrombin inhibition [32,333.it is unknown whcthcr the long floppy amino terminus of cglin c hus uny biological significtlnsc.
