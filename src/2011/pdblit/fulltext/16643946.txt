Folding rates of small single-domain proteins that fold through simple twostate kinetics can be estimated from details of the three-dimensional protein structure. Previously, predictions of secondary structure had been exploited to predict folding rates from sequence. Here, we estimate twostate folding rates from predictions of internal residue­residue contacts in proteins of unknown structure. Our estimate is based on the correlation between the folding rate and the number of predicted long-range contacts normalized by the square of the protein length. It is well known that longrange order derived from known structures correlates with folding rates. The surprise was that estimates based on very noisy contact predictions were almost as accurate as the estimates based on known contacts. On average, our estimates were similar to those previously published from secondary structure predictions. The combination of these methods that exploit different sources of information improved performance. It appeared that the combined method reliably distinguished fast from slow two-state folders.

Multi-state folding rate inversely proportional to protein length Advances in the experimental and theoretical study of the dynamics of protein folding have improved our understanding of the phenomenon over the last few years.1 Various theories and simulations suggest a surprisingly simple relation between the number of residues in a protein, its length L, and the rate at which it folds.2­6 Basically,

this relation is of the form: logðkf Þf C1 LC2 (1)

where kf is the experimental folding rate, L is the length of the protein, and C1 and C2 are simple constants. For proteins that fold through "transition states",7,8 all values of C2 between 0 and 1 give a good estimate for the multi-state transition through intermediates, i.e. the longer the protein the slower the transition.9 In contrast to multi-state transitions, equation (1) does not hold for single-domain twostate folders, i.e. proteins that fold without intermediates directly into their native three-dimensional (3D) structure. In other words, protein length does not describe the transition rates of direct folding. Two-state folding rates correlate with secondary structure In solution, native secondary structure such as helices can form even in the unfolded state.10 This

Protein Folding Rates from Contact Predictions

Figure 1. Sketch of underlying method. (a) PROFcon predicts the probability of a spatial contact between each pair of residues ij in the protein. The output of PROFcon is a number between 0 and 1, with scores closer to 1 indicating a higher probability for the pair to be in contact. Iterating over all possible residue pairs in the protein produces a list (b) of scores. By fixing a cut-off on the output score (we used 0.45), all pairs ranking below the cut-off were discarded. Next, pairs with sequence separations %14 were eliminated. The remaining number of pairs divided by L2 (L is the protein length) was our estimate for the number of long-range contacts (LROpred; equation (4)).

implies that regular secondary structure might be a key player in determining the rate of folding. Indeed, two recent methods estimate folding rates directly from secondary structure content. George Rose and collaborators11 observed that folding rates correlate very well with the overall secondary structure composition in three states (helix, strand, other) assigned from 3D co-ordinates through the programs DSSP12 and PROSS.11 Ivankov & Finkelstein13 have introduced the concept of an "effective length of a folding chain" that is defined as the length of the protein L minus the number of residues in helical conformation, plus the number of helices; more precisely:13 Leff Z L K LH C C3 NH ; and LP Z ðLeff ÞP eff (2)

prediction of two-state protein folding rates from sequence alone. Our method relies on predictions of residue­residue contacts to tap into another correlation, first reported by Gromiha & Selvaraj,15 namely that between folding rates and the longrange order (LRO).15 LRO is defined as: X N LRO ¼ 12 ; N12 ¼ d3D ij L jiKjjO12 ( (3) 1; if dij % 0:8 nm 3D dij ¼ 0; else where L is the protein length, and N12 is the number of residues that are in spatial contact (dij is the spatial distance of Ca atoms) and are more than 12 sequence positions apart. Gromiha & Selvaraj15 observed that choosing the sequence separation threshold to be exactly 12 residues resulted in the highest correlation between two-state folding rates and LRO for a set of 23 two-state folders. Not surprisingly, LRO anti-correlates with the helical composition because in helices many residues saturate their "contactability" through short-range contacts. PROFcon accurately predicts the LRO from sequence PROFcon is a neural network trained to predict intra-chain residue­residue contacts.16 For each pair of internal residues ij, PROFcon predicts the probability that i and j are in spatial contact (closer than 0.8 nm for Cb atoms). One remarkable and

where LH is the number of residues in helical conformation, NH is the number of helices and C 3R0 is a simple constant parameter to be optimized. The effective length, taken to the power by any value between PZ0.1 and 0.7, correlates with two-state and multi-state protein folding rates. Remarkably, the folding rates correlate almost as well with the predicted (PSIPRED14) as with the observed (DSSP12) helical content. Folding rates can therefore be estimated directly from sequence, i.e. without explicit knowledge of experimental 3D structures. Two-state folding rates correlate with longrange order (LRO) Here, we introduce a new approach to the

unexpected feature of PROFcon is that it can predict the overall number of contacts in a protein more accurately than any simple function (our unpublished results). In order to achieve this, we consider all the N(T) contacts predicted above a threshold of T, i.e. the N(T) most probable predictions (Figure 1; PROFcon is available online through PredictProtein 17). Using this protein-specific threshold in predicting contact maps also improves the contact predictions directly.16 In the context of two-state folding rates, the relevant finding is that our predictions allow the distinction between two proteins that both have L residues but differ in their numbers of contacts. The difference between predicting the number of contacts in a protein through its length18­21 and our method is crucial in this context because protein length correlates very poorly with two-state folding rates.9 The next step was to combine our prediction for the number of contacts with the correlation between the observed number of long-range contacts in two-state folders (LRO) and their folding rates. We defined the following quantity:
T LROpred Z NS =L2 T NS

Scores: L, sequence length (number of residues in protein) interval chosen to group data; Nprot, number of proteins in a sequence-unique subset of proteins from the PDB within the given length interval; R(LROpred, LRO), correlation between predicted long-range contacts and long-range order (SZ12 and TZ0.5; equation (4)). Data set: taken from the EVA version of the largest sequence-unique subset as of December 2003.39,40 All proteins in the set have X-ray structures at resolutions !0.25 nm. No pair in the set has levels of sequence similarity with HSSP valuesO022,23 to any other protein (this corresponds to !20% sequence identity for long alignments).

where is the number of pairs predicted by PROFcon with a score ST and separated by at least S sequence positions; L is the protein length. The normalization factor L2, in contrast to L in equation (3), was chosen because the number of contacts predicted by the raw PROFcon networks is proportional to L2. There are two free parameters to be chosen in our number of predicted long-range contacts (LROpred; equation (4)), the sequence separation S and the threshold T in the probability of our PROFcon for considering long-range contacts. In this case, we simply chose SZ12 in analogy to the optimal value found for the LRO15 (equation (3)), and TZ0.5, i.e. considered all residue pairs for which the PROFcon prediction for contact was higher than the prediction for non-contact. The number of long-range contacts predicted in this way (LROpred) correlated with the long-range order (LRO; Table 1). This correlation was significantly higher for shorter proteins. Different choices of S and T gave qualitatively similar results, i.e. the correlation was robust with our ad hoc choice. PROFcon performs better for shorter than for longer proteins; this may be the reason why the correlation between LROpred and LRO was higher for shorter proteins. Since most proteins experimentally known to fold directly (two-state transition) are short, this problem is not severely limiting our ability to estimate two-state folding rates. Data set and parameter optimization We used the set of 37 two-state folders introduced by Ivankov & Finkelstein.13 These proteins are not

sequence-unique, in fact, at HSSP values!0,22­24 this set is reduced to 31 proteins. The results for the correlation are similar for the entire and the sequence-unique subset. Furthermore, homologous proteins may differ in their folding rates. For example, the SH3 domain in human Fyn (PDB25,26 identifier, 1shf:A27) and the SH3 domain of the p85 alpha subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (1pnj28) have similar sequence (HSSP valueZ0.27); however, their folding rates differ substantially: for 1shf_A log(kf)Z2.0, and for 1pnj log(kf) ZK0.5 (kf is the experimentally derived folding rate). In order to simplify the comparison to the previous results,13 we therefore reported our performance on the full data set. It is also important to note that one protein (acylphosphatase, 2acy29) was used to train PROFcon; 13 others were sequence-similar to proteins used for training. Removing all these proteins from our set of two-state folders did not alter any of the results discussed below (data not shown). Note, furthermore, that our re-capitulation of the method introduced by Ivankov & Finkelstein (LP ; Table 2) was based on our secondary structure eff predictions from PROFphd30­32 rather than on those from PSIPRED14 and ALB33 used by Ivankov & Finkelstein. Again, this technical detail appeared not to have altered any results, since the PROFphd predictions yielded results similar to those obtained by the methods used previously13 (data not shown). The reported optimal estimates from LROpred were obtained for the following choices of the parameters: SZ14 and TZ0.45. For LP (equation (2)), eff we used PZ0.1 and C3Z1. Predicted long-range order correlates with folding rates The "effective length" (LP ; equation (2)) preeff dicted the folding rates remarkably well with a correlation of 0.70 in the jack-knife test, which was almost as high from sequence alone as the correlation between LRO and folding rates from 3D structures (Table 2). Note for comparison that the back-check, i.e. the value obtained after fitting LP eff

to all experimental rates, was K0.74 as reported.13 The correlation between our predicted long-range contacts LROpred and the folding rate was markedly lower (0.61 for jack-knife and K0.68 for back-check; Table 2). However, when considering the sum over the differences between estimate and predictions as a measure for the performance instead of the correlation then both the predicted effective length, LP , and the predicted long-range contacts, LROpred, eff reached rather similar levels (Table 2). For the 37 proteins the correlation between LROpred and LP eff reached 0.47; we observed a similar number (0.45) when testing the correlation between the two on a much larger data set of 199 proteins shorter than 150 residues that had been used to test our contact prediction method PROFcon16 (same set as used for Table 1). Results statistically significant In order to establish that the correlation achieved by our method was not due to the small data set, we carried out two different tests. Firstly, we calculated the probability that a correlation of K0.68 (Figure 2) could be achieved by chance. Toward this end, we randomly assigned the 37 values of the LROpred to the 37 experimental folding rates (taken as logar-

ithms) and calculated the correlation between these two sets (i.e. the random pairs of prediction/ observation). We repeated this operation 106 times; the correlation was Oj0.68j only five times (absolute values). By this model, the probability for a correlation to exceed 0.68 in our data set therefore is 5!10K6. Secondly, we estimated the standard error in our estimate for the correlation between our prediction and the observed folding rates by bootstrapping34 the 37 pairs of predicted/observed rates. The average was K0.67 with a standard deviation of 0.12. Even the lower limit (the average minus standard plus the deviation, i.e. K0.67C 0.12ZK0.55) had a chance of being random of !4.6!10K4. Clearly then, the correlation between predicted and experimental folding rates was statistically significant. Predictions more accurate for short proteins The Lyme disease antigen Vlse of Borrelia burgdorferi (1l8w35) was an extreme outlier in the distribution of our predictions (Figure 2). This 341 residue protein is by far the longest protein in our dataset; the next longest was cyclophilin A (1lop36) with 164 residues, and the average over the entire set was 84 residues. Obviously, our method failed

for proteins much longer than the average domain length (around 100 residues37,38). Excluding this outlier left us with 36 proteins for which the LROpred (predicted long-range contacts) predicted folding rates more accurately than the LP (effective eff length) measured both by correlation and mean deviation (Table 2, in bold). In fact, for these proteins our estimates from sequence alone were almost as accurate as the estimates from the full details of 3D structures (LRO). Although the helical content and LRO are related, we observed some degree of non-redundancy between the predictions based on contacts (LROpred) and those based on secondary structure (LP ). By simply compiling the eff arithmetic average over both, we improved the estimate of folding rates to a jack-knife correlation of 0.73 (for all 37 proteins) and to a deviation sum of 0.89. In other words, the performance was better than that of any of the two individual methods that predicted two-state folding rates from sequence alone. Implications for understanding folding? Two-state folding rates are closely related to the content in local, regular secondary structure,11 in particular to that in a-helices.13 Our results seem to suggest that although the a-helical content is crucial for determining two-state folding rates, some other mechanisms might play an important role. The extreme argument in point is highlighted by the observation that, when considering two-state folders that have a significant content of beta strands (i.e. all-beta; alpha/beta and alphaCbeta; 27 proteins in our dataset) the correlation between the effective length (equation (2)) and the folding rate becomes insignificant (0.13 in a jack-knife experiment), while the correlation between the long-range order and the folding rates remains considerable (O0.5 in a jack-knife experiment) for both the lookup from 3D structures (equation (3)) and for the prediction from sequence (equation (4)). Do our results then favor any model of folding over any other? We believe that our evidence was not clear and conclusive enough to answer that question in the affirmative. Conclusions We did not find new evidence concerning the question of what are the determinants of two-state folding rates. However, we have shown that estimates from local secondary structure and longrange contacts both somehow contribute independent information in a predictive sense. Our estimates are based on contact predictions that in turn rely mostly on local sequence features. Therefore, our results do not clearly falsify the assumption that folding rates are determined largely by local factors. Most importantly, even methods that predict internal residue­residue contacts at seemingly low levels of accuracy contain enough relevant information to predict two-state folding
