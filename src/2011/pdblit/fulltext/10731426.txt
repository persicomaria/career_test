The response regulator Spo0A is the master control element in the initiation of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Like many other multi-domain response regulators, the latent activity of the effector, C-terminal domain is stimulated by phosphorylation on a conserved aspartic acid residue in the regulatory, N-terminal domain. If a threshold concentration of phosphorylated Spo0A is achieved, the transcription of genes required for sporulation is activated, whereas the genes encoding stationary phase sentinels are repressed, and sporulation proceeds. Despite detailed genetic, biochemical and structural characterisation, it is not understood how the phosphorylation signal in the receiver domain is transduced into DNA binding and transcription activation in the distal effector domain. An obstacle to our understanding of Spo0A function is the uncertainty concerning changes in quaternary structure that accompany phosphorylation. Here we have revisited this question and shown unequivocally that Spo0A forms dimers upon phosphorylation and that the subunit interactions in the dimer are mediated principally by the receiver domain. Puri®ed dimers of two mutants of Spo0A, in which the phosphorylatable aspartic acid residue has been substituted, activate transcription from the spoIIG promoter in vitro, whereas monomers do not. This suggests that dimers represent the activated form of Spo0A.

that lead to the construction of the highly resistant dormant endospore, which is released upon lysis of the mother cell. An expanded two-component system, termed a phosphorelay, is responsible for transducing the indicators of an adverse cellular environment into the activation of the scores of genes necessary for spore formation.1 ± 3 The signals originate at several sensor kinases that autophosphorylate and subsequently transfer the phosphoryl group via Spo0F and Spo0B, to the response regulator Spo0A.1,2,4 Phosphorylated Spo0A binds to seven base-pair DNA consensus sequences, known as 0A-boxes, and activates genes required for sporulation and represses the expression of other genes associated with the stationary phase.5,6 Transcriptional pro®ling using DNA arrays has shown that the expression levels of some 10 % of the open reading frames in the Bacillus subtilis genome are signi®cantly affected in spo0A mutants.7

236 Spo0A consists of two domains of similar size, a C-terminal effector domain (C-Spo0A), which is regulated by an N-terminal phosphoacceptor domain (N-Spo0A). The crystal structures of N-Spo0A from Bacillus stearothermophilus in both phosphorylated (N-Spo0A $ P) and unphosphorylated forms have been determined.8,9 The former provided the ®rst visualisation of phosphorylated aspartic acid, revealing that the phosphoryl group and the associated divalent metal ion are surrounded by a quintet of the most highly conserved residues in the response-regulator family. It also pointed to a structural basis for aspartic acid phosphate signalling, in which a concerted rearrangement of the side-chains of Thr84 and Phe105 accompany Spo0A activation. Similar conformational changes have been observed in the structures of two other ``activated'' response regulators, N-FixJ $ P and in the BeF3 complex of CheY.10 ± 12 These observations and sequence comparisons suggest that the activation mechanism, which is variously described as an ``aromatic switch'' or a ``threonine ¯ip, tyrosine tuck'', is conserved across the response-regulator family. In many response regulators, phosphorylation promotes the formation of dimers (FixJ, OmpR) or even oligomers (NtrC, UhpA); however, in other cases (Spo0F, CheY, CheB) the active form is clearly a monomer.13 ± 15 Whether quaternary structural changes in Spo0A accompany phosphorylation is not resolved. One study concluded that B. subtilis Spo0A is a monomer that dimerizes on phosphorylation,16 while another suggests that there is no change in quaternary structure of Spo0A on phosphorylation.17 The two crystal structures of the receiver domain of Spo0A from B. stearothermophilus failed to resolve the issue because these revealed the phosphorylated protein as a monomer8 and the unphosphorylated protein as a 3D domain-swapped dimer9 (Figure 1). These contradictory observations have prompted us to re-examine the quaternary structure of Spo0A and its domains more closely using gel-®ltration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Spo0A from both B. subtilis and B. stearothermophilus were examined so that observations could be correlated with genetic and structural knowledge, respectively.

Gel-filtration studies of Spo0A phosphorylation We examined the behaviour of native Spo0A, NSpo0A (residues 1-130) and C-Spo0A (residues 139260) from B. stearothermophilus by chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 gel-®ltration column. In each case, the puri®ed native proteins eluted as

The existence of such a Spo0A $ P monomer-dimer equilibrium might partially explain the opposing conclusions of earlier gel-®ltration studies of B. subtilis Spo0A.16,17 Analytical ultracentrifugation studies of Spo0A phosphorylation Since the mobility of proteins in gel-®ltration columns depends on molecular shape as well as size, we investigated the oligomerization phenomenon further by analytical ultracentrifugation. Using sedimentation-equilibrium analysis, the molecular masses of N-Spo0A, C-Spo0A and Spo0A from B. stearothermophilus were determined to be 14,100 (Æ1000) Da, 13,400 (Æ200) Da and 31,100 (Æ1000) Da, respectively. Plots of point average molecular mass versus absorbance are shown for the 22,000 rpm (35,300 g) runs in Figure 3(a), and the results are summarised in Table 2. The measured molecular masses are in close agreement with those calculated for monomeric species of the three samples, 14,597 Da, 13,468 Da and 28,838 Da, respectively. We next determined the sedimentation characteristics of these proteins after (1) incubation in the presence of phosphoramidate and (2) removal of the phosphorylating agent by gel-®ltration chroma-

single peaks with apparent molecular masses 1.2 to 1.3-fold greater than the respective polypeptide molecular masses (Table 1). These data indicate that all three species are monomers. To generate the phosphorylated forms, the proteins were treated with phosphoramidate that reacts speci®cally with the phosphorylatable aspartic acid residue in response regulators.18 ± 21 Phosphoramidate treatment of N-Spo0A increases the protein's mobility on gel-®ltration. The elution volume and pro®le suggest a single species with a molecular mass of 44 kDa, consistent with N-Spo0A forming oligomers upon phosphorylation. Phosphoramidate treatment of C-Spo0A had, as expected, no effect on its elution pro®le. Figure 2 shows the gel-®ltration chromatograms for full-length Spo0A from B. subtilis before and after treatment with phosphoramidate. Spo0A from B. stearothermophilus exhibited very similar pro®les (data not shown). The principal peak in the phosphorylated sample occurs at a lower elution volume than that for the untreated protein and corresponds to a species with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa. This suggests the presence of Spo0A $ P dimers. There is a noticeable shoulder on the higher elution volume side indicating the presence of lower molecular mass species, presumably monomers. One explanation for the trailing of protein elution is that the phosphorylation of Spo0A by phosphoramidate was incom-

Blue, untreated Spo0A; Green, Spo0A after incubation for 30 minutes in the presence of 50 mM phosphoramidate; and Red, Spo0A after phosphoramidate treatment as above, followed by incubation with the Spo0A-speci®c phosphatase Spo0E94 (25 mg.mlÀ1; $3 mM) for 30 minutes. In each experiment the samples contained 0.1 ml of Spo0A at a concentration of approximately 2 mg.mlÀ1 (70 mM). The column was run in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2 and 250 mM NaCl. Phosphoramidate treatment increases the mobility of Spo0A. This is reversed by subsequent treatment with the phosphatase. The absorbance at 280 nm was recorded in a ¯ow cell with a path length of 2 mm. The dotted line is the chromatogram for a mixture of molecular mass standards, these being, from left to right, bovine serum albumin (67,000 Da), ovalbumin (43,000 Da), chymotrypsinogen (25,000 Da) and RNase A (13,700 Da).

The molecular mass versus absorbance plots were generated using the software supplied with the centrifuge. Point average molecular masses were determined using sliding strips with 20-point smoothing. (a) Unphosphorylated Spo0A, N-Spo0A and C-Spo0A. Each of these species has a determined molecular mass close to that expected for their respective monomer molecular masses. (b) Phosphoramidate-treated Spo0A, N-Spo0A and C-Spo0A. As can be seen the molecular masses for Spo0A and N-Spo0A have increased upon phosphorylation: in the case of N-Spo0A the species is dimeric. The data shown are for three different loading concentrations at 22,000 rpm (35,300 g): Spo0A, 1.2, 2.4 and 4.8 mM; N-Spo0A, 4.8, 9.6 and 19.2 mM; C-Spo0A, 1.8, 3.6 and 7.2 mM. Data for Spo0A $ P were ®tted to a monomer-dimer equilibrium which yielded a value of 13 (Æ3) mM for Kd.

(28,838 Da), but less than that expected for a dimer (57,676 Da), suggesting that both monomers and dimers were present. The data showed that the molecular mass increased with increasing concentration, with data from the three loading concentrations overlapping (Figure 3(b)). This is characteristic of a system in equilibrium; if this were not the case, diluting the sample would not affect the average molecular mass of the species present and each plot would simply be translated to a smaller concentration value.22 A ®t of the data to a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium yielded a Kd of 13.0 (Æ3) mM. This value of Kd would be an overestimate if, as we suspect, unphosphorylated Spo0A was present because either (1) phosphoramidate did not completely phosphorylate Spo0A or (2) dephosphorylation of Spo0A $ P occurred during the ultracentrifugation experiment ($48 hours). The sedimentation analysis revealed that the apparent molecular mass of N-Spo0A $ P, 28,300 (Æ400) Da, was double that of native N-Spo0A, as may be seen by comparing Figure 3(a) and (b). This again suggested the presence of dimers. In this case, dilution of the sample had little effect on the observed molecular mass. We conclude that only the dimeric species was present. If dissociation to monomers was occurring, it was at a level that was not detectable in these experiments, implying that the Kd value would have to be <50 nM. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that Spo0A and N-Spo0A formed dimers upon phosphorylation. Furthermore, the results suggested that dimerization in intact Spo0A was mediated by the N-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain exerts some inhibitory effect on dimerization, since the intact Spo0A protein is not wholly dimeric, but some dissociation to monomers is observed.

Resolution of solution and X-ray crystallographic observations Crystal structures of N-Spo0A from B. stearothermophilus in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms have been determined (Figure 1). In crystals grown in the presence of 200 mM CaCl2 at pH 6.0, four phosphorylated N-Spo0A protomers are present in the asymmetric unit and analysis of the intermolecular contacts does not provide any convincing evidence for dimer formation.8 In contrast, in crystals grown from solutions of the protein buffered at pH 4, unphosphorylated N-Spo0A is a 3D domainswapped dimer whose protomers are related by a crystallographic dyad axis of symmetry9 (Figure 1(b)). These observations contradict the hydrodynamic data presented here, which showed that N-Spo0A was a monomer, forming dimers only when Asp55 was phosphorylated. In an attempt to reconcile these observations we have carried out analytical ultracentrifugation analysis

tography. Phosphoramidate treatment had no signi®cant effect on the apparent molecular mass of C-Spo0A (12,600 (Æ500) Da), consistent with expectations and with the gel-®ltration data (Figure 3(b); Table 2). Following exposure of intact Spo0A to phosphoramidate the apparent molecular mass increased to a value of 45,500 (Æ5000) Da, which is greater than that expected for a monomer

Buffer conditions were 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.25 M NaCl with a solution density of 1.0096. Molecular masses evaluated according to single-species ®ts were determined by non-linear least-squares ®tting of the combined data at three loading concentrations (Spo0A, 1.2, 2.4 and 4.8 mM; N-Spo0A, 4.8, 9.6 and 19.2 mM; C-Spo0A, 1.8, 3.6 and 7.2 mM) and at three separate run speeds: 15,000, 22,000 and 28,000 rpm (16,400, 35,300 and 57,100 g). The numbers in brackets represent the 95 % con®dence limits. Fitting to a monomer-dimer model was on the basis of theoretical molecular masses and calculated n values, and the equilibrium constant was ®tted. The resulting best-®t association constants in optical units (Kop) were converted to dissociation constants using the equation: Kd  2/(Kop ÁlÁe280). where l was the optical path-length of the centrifuge cell (1.2 cm).

A solution density of 1.00957 was used, except for the case where 200 mM CaCl2 was added, in which case a value of 1.01687 was used. Solution densities were calculated using standard tables, according to Laue et al.41

in buffers similar to those used for crystal growth.9,23 Sedimentation-velocity analysis suggested that N-Spo0A $ P formed a less stable dimer in the presence of 200 mM CaCl2 at pH 6.0, with the data pointing to a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a Kd value of around 30 mM (Figure 4). Even so, these results suggested that at the concentrations of protein used in crystallisation experiments ($500 mM) only a minority of the protein would be present as monomers. It appears that as these monomers assembled into crystals, further dissociation of the dimers occurred and crystal growth continued. To investigate the oligomerization of unphosphorylated N-Spo0A under the crystallisation con-

ditions we performed sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments on the protein at pH 4.0. Lowering the pH value led to an increase in the sedimentation coef®cient of N-Spo0A, suggesting that the molecular mass was greater than that expected for a monomer. Fitting of the sedimentation equilibrium data to a monomer/dimer equilibrium yielded a dissociation constant of 8 mM. Therefore we conclude that lowering the pH leads to the formation of dimers that would be the predominant species at the elevated protein concentrations used for crystallisation. We assume that these dimers are the a5 helix-swapped dimers seen in the crystals.9 Sedimentation-equilibrium experiments were also performed on N-Spo0A samples that had been incubated at pH 4 for between 12 and 24 hours before the pH was returned to 7.0. The traces for these ``pH-jumped'' samples suggested the presence of both monomers and dimers, in contrast to the exclusively monomeric constitution of the protein prior to the pH jump. Moreover, the average molecular mass of the species present did not change upon dilution, suggesting that these monomers and dimers were no longer in equilibrium.22 This indicated that (1) lowering the pH value from 7.0 to 4.0 transformed N-Spo0A monomers into an equilibrium mixture of monomers and domainswapped dimers and (2) restoring the pH to 7.0 effectively trapped this population of molecules, resulting in a mixture of monomers and dimers, which were no longer equilibrating. Reversibility of dimerization by the action of a phosphatase The protein phosphatase Spo0E speci®cally removes the phosphoryl group from Spo0A $ P thus draining phosphate from the phosphorelay and inhibiting sporulation.24 We were interested in

240 establishing whether Spo0E could reverse phosphorylation-induced dimerization of Spo0A in vitro. Puri®ed B. subtilis Spo0A was phosphorylated using phosphoramidate, and subsequently treated with a hyperactive mutant (Spo0E94) form of Spo0E at a Spo0A:Spo0E molar ratio of 20:1. The molecular masses of the components in the Spo0A $ P/Spo0E94 mixture were then analysed by gel-®ltration chromatography. After incubation with Spo0E94, the gel-®ltration chromatogram resembled closely that obtained for monomeric Spo0A (Mrapp  39,000) before phosphorylation, with no indication of the presence of either Spo0A dimers or of a Spo0A:Spo0E complex (Figure 2, red trace). The elution of the Spo0E94 component of this mixture is not detectable in this experiment due to a combination of its low concentration and its low extinction coef®cient at 280 nm. We also analysed the effects of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on N-Spo0A from B. stearothermophilus using a non-radioactive phosphorylation assay, described for Spo0F.20 Untreated and phosphoramidate-treated N-Spo0A were resolved by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both species migrate as single bands in these gels; however, N-Spo0A $ P has a signi®cantly lower mobility than N-Spo0A, each having Rf values (relative to bromophenol blue) of 0.62 and 0.76, respectively (Figure 5). This slower-moving band was likely to be N-Spo0A $ P dimers. It would appear that all of the N-Spo0A is dimeric under these conditions. Incubation of N-Spo0A $ P with Spo0E94 for 30 minutes at an approximate molar ratio of 6:1 returned the fragment to the faster-migrating form, presumably because dephosphorylation resulted in dissociation of the dimers. The presence of 50 mM phosphoramidate did not prevent the reappearance of the faster-migrating

Dimerization of Spo0A

species brought about by addition of Spo0E94. This indicated that Spo0E94 was more ef®cient as a phosphatase than phosphoramidate was as a phosphodonor, an observation which was not surprising, since phosphoramidate is known to phosphorylate the related response regulator Spo0F rather sluggishly ($20-fold slower compared with the cognate sensor kinase, KinA $ P).20 The gel-®ltration and gel-electrophoresis data taken together suggest that the phosphatase function of Spo0E serves to promote dissociation of Spo0A dimers.

Domain-swapped dimers activate transcription without phosphorylation With the initial aim of providing controls for some of the biophysical experiments described above, we puri®ed two single-site mutants of Spo0A from B. subtilis, in which the active-site Asp56 has been substituted with either an asparagine or glutamine residue. These mutants lack the phosphorylatable carboxylate group in the active site, so that spo0A(D56N) and spo0A(D56Q) strains of B. subtilis do not sporulate, and the puri®ed Spo0A(D56N) and Spo0A(D56Q) proteins are not phosphorylated by the other phosphorelay components.1 In the course of purifying the mutant Spo0A proteins, we observed that each could be resolved into two discrete fractions upon gel-®ltration, corresponding to monomers and dimers, an interpretation that was con®rmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. These monomer and dimer components did not interconvert over a period of several days. The dimers are likely to have formed when the protein was maintained in an acidic buffer (Mes) at pH 5.6, presumably by helix a5 domain swapping. To examine transcription activation, we used an in vitro assay which detects transcripts produced by puri®ed B. subtilis sA RNA polymerase from the Spo0A-dependent spoIIG promoter.25,26 It has been shown that phosphorylation of Spo0A induces a dramatic increase in its ability to stimulate transcription from this promoter.25,27,28 Wildtype Spo0A that had been phosphorylated by the phosphorelay components (KinA, Spo0F and Spo0B) and ATP, and the monomer and dimer forms of the D56N and D56Q mutant proteins were added to single-round in vitro transcription assays. As shown in Figure 6, the monomeric fractions of both Spo0A(D56N) and Spo0A(D56Q) supported only a basal level of transcription from the spoIIG promoter similar to unphosphorylated wildtype Spo0A. In contrast, the dimer forms of both mutants were able to activate transcription from this promoter. The Spo0A(D56N) dimers appeared to be less active than the Spo0A(D56Q) dimers, whose activity approached that of the phosphorylated wild-type protein.

Dimerization of Spo0A

241 zation induced by domain-swapping appears to result in functionally equivalent, though not necessarily structurally equivalent, rearrangements of the domains as dimerization induced by phosphorylation. This implies that the effects of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on transcription activation by Spo0A are mediated through reversible dimer formation. In wild-type Spo0A, the receiver and effector domains are tethered together by a ¯exible linker, 20 or so residues in length. In the unphosphorylated form the two domains interact in such a way that the active surfaces in the C-domain, perhaps the sA activating region (SAAR), are occluded by interaction with the receiver domain (Figure 7, middle). Just as the properties of the effector domain are inhibited by its interactions with the receiver domain, we propose that a key function of the receiver domain, namely dimerization, is inhibited by its reciprocal interactions with the effector domain. Phosphorylation at Asp55 destabilises the

Figure 6. Dimer forms of the Spo0A mutants stimulate transcription by sA-RNA polymerase from the spoIIG promoter in vitro. The production of transcripts from the spoIIG promoter by B. subtilis sA-RNA polymerase was tested in the presence of Spo0A, Spo0A $ P, Spo0A(D56N) monomers, Spo0A(D56N) dimers, Spo0A(D56Q) monomers or Spo0A(D56Q) dimers, as described in Materials and Methods. Transcripts were detected by the Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimaging system. Four concentrations of each protein form (60, 120, 240 and 480 nM) were tested in the in vitro singleround transcription assay.

Discussion
The data presented here lead to the following conclusions: (1) Spo0A is a monomer which dimerizes upon phosphorylation; (2) dimer formation is mediated principally by the N-terminal receiver domain, with the C-terminal effector domain exerting an inhibitory in¯uence; (3) following dephosphorylation of Spo0A $ P by its cognate phosphatase Spo0E, the dimer form is less stable and dissociation to monomers takes place; and (4) dimers formed by domain-swapping no longer required phosphorylation to activate transcription. Overall, the effects of phosphorylation may be viewed as altering an equilibrium between inactive and active forms of Spo0A in favour of the latter. The results presented here suggest that this is achieved through changing the Kd for the monomer-dimer equilibrium by greater than two orders of magnitude in the direction of the dimers, which are the active species. The crystallographic observations of domainswapped unphosphorylated N-Spo0A dimers and phosphorylated N-Spo0A $ P monomers can be attributed to the in¯uences of the low pH and the high Ca2 concentrations of the respective crystallisation buffers. The domain-swapped N-Spo0A dimers induced by low pH (Figure 1(b)) are almost certainly different from the N-Spo0A dimers induced by phosphorylation, and we have no evidence to suggest that the former are relevant to signalling in this response regulator. The low-pHinduced helix swapping does however provide a route to Spo0A dimers that is independent of phosphorylation. Dimers of two unphosphorylatable mutants, Spo0A(D56N) and Spo0A(D56Q), were able to support transcriptional activation. Dimeri-

Figure 7. Dimer formation is the key to transcription activation in Spo0A. The regulatory (N) and effector (C) domains of Spo0A are joined by a ¯exible linker. Spo0A forms dimers when it is phosphorylated, either by the phosphorelay component Spo0B or by small molecule phosphodonors such as phosphoramidate. This dimerization is reversed by Spo0A-speci®c phosphatases such as Spo0E. Spo0A forms dimers reversibly in vitro in the absence of phosphorylation when the solution pH is lowered. Neutralisation of these solutions traps any domain-swapped dimers. Phosphorylated Spo0A dimers and unphosphorylated domain-swapped Spo0A dimers are both able to activate transcription.

242 intramolecular interactions between the domains, (1) allowing pairs of receiver domains to mediate dimer formation and (2) exposing the surfaces in the effector domain required for transcription activation (Figure 7, top). A drop in the pH value leads to dimerization of the isolated receiver domains by an a5 helix-swapping mechanism, and we speculate that the same thing can happen in intact Spo0A. The capacity of dimers of Spo0A(D56Q) and Spo0A(D56N) to activate transcription suggests that in these dimers, as in dimers of wild-type Spo0A $ P, the active surfaces in the effector domain are exposed (Figure 7, bottom). With regard to the role of dimerization and the mechanism of Spo0A activation, it is likely to be signi®cant that 0A-boxes are found in two or more copies at Spo0A-regulated promoters.29 Phosphorylation-induced dimerization of Spo0A would be expected to increase dramatically the af®nity of Spo0A for tandemly repeated 0A-boxes within the promoter regions of target genes. Furthermore, phosphorylation-promoted dimer formation would account for the observation that a threshold concentration of Spo0A $ P must be attained before sporulation can commence.30 Another view of the role of dimers in Spo0A activation is that dimer formation in Spo0A is simply a means of sequestering the receiver domains so that they can no longer inhibit the activity of the effector domain. It is known, for example, that the sad mutants of Spo0A, which have deletions of signi®cant proportions of the receiver domain, are constitutively active.31 Moreover, in vitro experiments have shown that CSpo0A is as active as Spo0A $ P in stimulating transcription from the spoIIG promoter, even though its DNA binding is weaker.32 The differences in DNA af®nity do not lead to differences in the extent of transcription stimulation because Spo0A does not function by recruiting RNA polymerase to the promoter but rather by facilitating the isomerization of the enzyme-DNA complex to the open form.32 Viewed in the light of these data, any modi®cation of Spo0A which liberates the effector domain from the inhibition of the receiver domain, should activate Spo0A function. Deletion or removal of the receiver domains and dimers formed by phosphorylation or domain swapping are different ways this could be brought about. If the dimer formed upon phosphorylation of Spo0A is not formed by domain swapping, how is it formed? For Spo0A this question cannot yet be answered with certainty but the available evidence points to the surface surrounding Phe105 on what is termed the 455 (b4-a5-b5) face of the molecule. Comparison of the structure of N-Spo0A $ P with the structures of other response regulators in their unphosphorylated forms suggests that the most signi®cant structural change accompanying phosphorylation is the reorientation of this Phe sidechain following the movement of the side-chain of Thr84 towards the phosphorylated aspartate

residue.8 In FixJ, which is also activated by a phosphorylation-mediated dimer-formation mechanism, the corresponding Phe101 undergoes a similar conformational change, and in crystals of N-FixJ $ P this residue is a central element in the dimer interface formed between pairs of 455 surfaces.11 Aromatic switching and the 455 interface are implicated in signalling in CheB and CheY, even though dimer formation is not involved. In unphosphorylated CheB, the active site of the methylesterase domain is occluded by interactions with the 455 surface of the receiver domain, and it seems highly plausible that phosphorylation disrupts this interaction by changing the conformation of Phe104.33 Tyr106, which is key to the activation of CheY10,34 forms part of the intermolecular interface between CheY and CheA, which again features the 455 surface of the response regulator.35 Residues from this same surface of CheY $ P mediate the binding of a second target protein FliM,12,36 a component of the ¯agellar motor. Further experiments, including structural studies, are now needed to de®ne clearly (1) the intersubunit interactions in N-Spo0A $ P and Spo0A $ P dimers, (2) the inter-domain interactions responsible for inhibition in unphosphorylated Spo0A, and (3) whether, as we suspect, a common surface in the receiver domain is involved in both interactions.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification The protein puri®cation procedures for both Spo0A and C-Spo0A included the use of heparin Sepharose as an af®nity matrix, as previously published.23 N-Spo0A was puri®ed according to an improved protocol9 to that previously described.23 His-tagged Spo0E94 was overexpressed as described for Spo0E24 and puri®ed to homogeneity by Ni-NTA and gel-®ltration chromatography. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM aminoethyl benzenesulphonyl ¯uoride (AEBSF)) before lysis by sonication and clari®cation by centrifugation. The lysate was applied to a Ni-NTA Sepharose column and eluted, after stringent washing, with 500 mM imidazole. The fractions containing Spo0E94 were concentrated and further puri®ed by gel-®ltration chromatography in buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl) before storage at À20  C in buffer B supplemented with 10 % (v/v) glycerol. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions The potassium salt of phosphoramidate was prepared by the method of Sheridan et al.37 Phosphorylation of Spo0A proteins, at protein concentrations between 50 and 500 mM in a reaction buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10 % glycerol, was initiated by the addition of phosphoramidate to a ®nal concentration of 50 mM. These reactions were incubated for 30 minutes at 37  C. MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometric analysis of N-Spo0A so treated revealed the presence of two peaks separated by 80 mass

Dimerization of Spo0A units, consistent with the covalent attachment of a phosphoryl group. For dephosphorylation of Spo0A $ P, 50-550 mM Spo0A $ P was mixed with Spo0E94 (2-100 mM), in a reaction volume of 0.1-0.2 ml of buffer B supplemented with 25 mM MgCl2. Like other hyperactive forms of Spo0E, Spo0E94 is truncated at the C terminus,38 in this instance by 26 amino acid residues. After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature, the reactants were analysed by gel-®ltration chromatography. In control experiments, a similar Spo0A $ P sample was left for 30 minutes at room temperature before loading on to the same gel-®ltration column. Data analysis of sedimentation-velocity data

Gel filtration A 100 ml volume of each of the Spo0A proteins, at concentrations between 50 and 500 mM, was applied to a Pharmacia Superdex 75 HR 10/30 gel-®ltration column, equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 250 mM NaCl. According to the manufacturer, this column effectively separates globular proteins in the molecular mass range 3000 to 70,000 Da. The molecular mass standards used for comparison were: bovine serum albumin (67,000 Da), ovalbumin (43,000 Da), chymotrypsinogen (25,000 Da) and RNase A (13,700 Da). Blue dextran ($2,000,000 Da) was used in order to determine the void volume of the column.

All sedimentation-velocity data were analysed using the program SEDFIT.39 Typically, about 60 traces were used in the data analysis of the run total of 99; those not used generally corresponded to essentially complete sedimentation of the protein. Sedimentation-coef®cient distributions and boundary analyses were performed in this program using the method of van Holde and Weischet.40 To determine a dissociation constant for the data, two sets of sedimentation-velocity data were globally ®tted to a rapidly reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium model in which the value for the sedimentation coef®cient of the monomer (SM) was ¯oated and the sedimentation coef®cient of the dimer was taken to be 1.5 SM. This procedure is an approximation which is valid provided that the species can be treated as spheres. Detailed consideration of shape effects was not warranted by the accuracy of the data. The root-mean-square deviation as a function of Kd was determined using the ``K-contour'' option in the program. The rmsÁ was plotted as a function of Kd to evaluate the best-®t value of the dissociation constant and to demonstrate that this value was a global minimum. Data analysis of sedimentation-equilibrium data Data were excised from the traces using the program NONLIN. The data were then analysed either by a single-species ®t: ! o2 " ctotal  cmonomerYrf exp 1 M1 À nrr2 À r2  f 2RT or according to a self-associating dimerization model: ! o2 " ctotal  cmonomerYrf exp M1 À nrr2 À r2  f 2RT 2 ! o2 2 2 "  cdimerYrf exp M1 À nrr À rf  RT where c  concentration; r  radial position; rf  radial reference position; M  molecular mass of the smallest detectable species; n  partial speci®c volume; r  solvent density; o  angular velocity; R  the universal gas constant; and T  thermodynamic temperature. Best-®t parameters were obtained by non-linear least-squares regression using the Beckman software. Solvent densities were calculated using the program SEDNTERP.41 The same programme was used to evaluate the partial speci®c volumes of the various species, on the basis of their amino acid residue compositions, and the values of the extinction coef®cients at 280 nm from the known tryptophan and tryosine residue contents. The extinction coef®cients at 230 nm were calculated from the ratio of absorbance at 280 and 230 nm from a ®xed radial wavelength scan at 3000 rpm (650 g), using the analytical ultracentrifuge. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Duplicate 28 mM samples of N-Spo0A from B. stearothermophilus were phosphorylated with 50 mM phosphoramidate for 30 minutes at 37  C in a reaction buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT in a volume of 20 ml. For dephosphorylation, Spo0E94 was added directly to one of these samples, to a ®nal concentration of 5 mM, and both reactions were further

Analytical ultracentrifugation All analytical-ultracentrifugation experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter, CA, USA) using an AN-Ti 60 rotor. Sedimentation-velocity experiments were carried out using Epon two-channel centrepieces with protein-loading concentrations in the range 5-20 mM. The cells were scanned initially at 3000 rpm (650 g) to check for leaks, then returned to 0 rpm to equilibrate to temperature, a process that took 30-40 minutes. Once the desired temperature had been reached, the rotor speed was increased rapidly to 40,000 rpm (116,500 g) for the duration of the experiment. Radial scans of each of the cells were taken at intervals of ®ve minutes. Sedimentation-equilibrium experiments were carried out at 15,000, 22,000 and 28,000 rpm (16,400, 35,300 and 57,100 g) in Epon six-channel centrepieces with proteinloading concentrations in the range 1-20 mM. Radial absorbance scans at 230 nm were taken after 12 hours, and then after every six hours at each speed. Successive pairs of scans were subtracted from one another, and equilibrium was judged to have been established if there were no systematic deviations across each of the cell channels at each speed. After equilibrium had been attained, the rotor speed was increased to 36,000 rpm (94,440 g) for 12 hours to clear the meniscus, so as to obtain a true optical baseline. Under the conditions used in both the sedimentationequilibrium and velocity experiments, the effects of thermodynamic non-ideality would not be expected to be signi®cant: protein concentrations were usually <1 mg cmÀ3, and salt concentrations were less than 0.25 M, making allowance for preferential solvent interactions also unnecessary.

incubated for 30 minutes. Separately, 28 mM N-Spo0A was incubated for 60 minutes at 37  C in reaction buffer without phosphoramidate. The three samples were immediately analysed by non-denaturing polacrylamide gel electrophoresis through a 3 % (w/v) stacking and 12.5 % resolving gel at 150 V and 4  C, in a manner similar to that described by Zapf et al.20 Separation took approximately two hours. The gels were stained with Coomassie blue. Transcription assays Single-round in vitro transcription assays were performed as described by Cervin et al.42 In brief, assays were completed in a transcription buffer of 10 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgOAc, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 80 mM KOAc) in a ®nal volume of 10 ml. Phosphorylated Spo0A was prepared using the in vitro phosphorelay reaction exactly as described previously.1 Each concentration and form of Spo0A was incubated with 2 nM DNA template consisting of the isolated PvuII fragment from the plasmid pUCIIGtrpA that contains the spoIIG operon promoter, 130 bp downstream of the 1 transcription start site and the trpA terminator, along with sA RNA polymerase (25 nM) and the initiation nucleotides ATP (0.4 mM) and [a-32P]GTP (0.005 mM, 20 Ci/mM; NEN), at 37  C for two minutes. Elongation of RNA chains was brought about by the addition of a mixture of UTP, CTP (to make the ®nal concentration 0.4 mM each) and heparin (to a ®nal concentration of 10 mg/ml) and incubation for ®ve minutes at 37  C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 ml of stop buffer (7 M urea, 2 Â TBE, 1 % (w/v) each of tracking dyes bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). The transcription products were separated by electrophoresis through an 8 % polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, and visualised with a Molecular Dynamics SI Phosphorimager.
