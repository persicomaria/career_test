Bromopyruvate is a competitive inhibitor of maize leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate (Ki: 2.3 mM at pH 8). Relatively low concentrations of this compound completely and irreversibly inactivated the enzyme. The inactivation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The haloacid combines first with the carboxylase to give a reversible enzyme-bromopyruvate complex and then alkylates the enzyme. The maximum inactivation rate constant was 0.27 min-' at pH 7.2 and 30°C and the concentration of bromopyruvate giving half-maximum rate of inactivation was 1.8 MM. The inactivation was prevented by the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, in the absence or presence of MgClz, and by the competitive inhibitor P-glycolate. Malate afforded protection at pH 7 but not at pH 8. MgClz enhanced the inactivation when it was carried out at pH 7; its effect was mainly due to a decrease in the dissociation constant of the complex between bromopyruvate and the enzyme from 2 to 1.4 mM. This behavior was not observed at pH 8. Analysis of the inactivation at different pH suggests that a group of pKa near 7.5 is important for the binding of the reagent to the carboxylase. Determination of the number of sulfhydryl groups of the native and modified enzyme with [3H]-N-ethylmaleimide suggests that the inactivation correlates with the modification of thiol groups in the enzyme. The substrate prevented the modification of these groups. The results suggest that the alkylating reagent modifies cysteinyl residues at the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site of the carboxylase. o 1986 Academic press, I~~.

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (orthophosphate:oxaloacetate carboxylyase (phosphorylating), EC 4.1.1.31) catalyzes the following reaction in the presence of a divalent metal ion: phosphoenolpyruvate + HC03 oxaloacetate + Pi.

The reaction is highly exergonic (1) and the reverse reaction is not demonstrated. 1This work was supported by grants from Consejo National de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) via the Fundacibn Miguel Lillo and the Universidad National de Rosario.

This enzyme is widespread in all higher plants and many kinds of bacteria although its properties are different depending on the source (2). Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from bacteria and C3 plants plays a role in replenishing oxaloacetate to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (3), although other functions have been proposed for the enzyme of C3 plants [for a review see (4)]. In C, and Crassulucean plants it catalyzes the initial carboxylation reaction in the photosynthetic fixation of atmospheric COB (5, 6). The enzyme is typically allosteric and its activity is regulated by multiple effecters. In Cq plants, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is allosterically activated by glucose 6-phosphate (7) and is inhibited by carboxylic acids such as oxaloacetate and malate (8-ll), which are the primary products

of carboxylation in viva. A molecular weight of 400,000 has been reported for the purified phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from maize and other C4plants (9,12), and is composed of four subunits with equal molecular weights (12). The carbon atom of HCO; is ordinarily quite unreactive toward nucleophilic attack, and the way by which the carboncarbon bond formation is achieved is not totally understood. Although Maruyama et al. (13), working with the peanut enzyme, proposed a concerted mechanism for the carboxylation reaction, recent reports are consistent with a stepwise mechanism for the enzyme from maize (14), wheat (15), and Escherichia coli (16). Knowledge of the structure of the catalytic site(s) will help develop a better understanding of the mechanism by which phosphoenolpyruvate is carboxylated. Chemical modification studies on the maize enzyme have shown that cysteinyl (l'?-19), histidyl(20), and arginyl(21) residues are essential for the catalytic function. However, little is known about the environment and the functions of these residues in the active site of the enzyme. Substrate analogs are important tools for the study of the topography of the catalytic site. Among them, some phosphate esters such as phospholactate (22), l-hydroxycyclopropane carboxylic acid phosphate (23) and phosphoenol-a-ketobutyrate (24) have been used as reversible inhibitors of the carboxylase from various sources. Besides, phosphoenol-3-bromopyruvate behaves as a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor of the maize enzyme (25), although the site of alkylation has not been determined. Bromopyruvate, an analog of pyruvate, alkylates aminoacid residues at the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site(s) of pyruvate-phosphate dikinase from Bacteroidm symbiosus (26) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from E. coli (27). Recently, O'Leary (28) suggested that bromopyruvate reacts at the "malate site" of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from maize. We would like to present evidence indicating that this analog modifies active-site residues on the carboxylase purified from maize leaves.

Enzyme pur@cation and assay. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was extracted and purified from Zea mays as previously described (20). The purified enzyme had a sp act of 22-25 pmol * min-' . mg-`, and migrated as a single proteinic band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that the enzyme was more than 95% pure by this criterion. Enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically monitoring NADH oxidation at 340 nm and 30°C in an UNICAM SP 18OOB spectrophotometer by coupling the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase reaction to malic dehydrogenase. The standard assay medium contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mM MgClz, 0.15 mM NADH, 10 mM NaHCOs, 2 IU malic dehydrogenase, 4 mM phosphoenolpyruvate and phosphocarboxylase (4 pg of protein) in a total enolpyruvate volume of 1 ml. Protein measurement. Protein concentration was determined by the calorimetric method of Lowry et al. (29), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Enzyme inactivation. The reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and bromopyruvate was carried out at 30°C in a reaction medium containing 50 mM Mops'-NaOH (at the corresponding pH), enzyme (0.4 mg of protein/ml) and different concentrations of bromopyruvate, as indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was stopped at the desired extent of inactivation by 100 times dilution in the assay medium. The addition of the modifier (100 times diluted) to the assay medium had no effect on the enzyme activity.

A molecular weight of 400,000 (12) was used to determine the molar concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Materials. 3-bromopyruvate was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Solutions were prepared in water before each experiment and the pH was adjusted to 7 with NaOH. Phosphoenolpyruvate (monopotassium salt), P-glycolate, NADH, malic acid, glucose-6-phosphate and porcine heart malic dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. The N-(ethyl-2-Q) maleimide (specific radioactivity 300 Ci/mol) was purchased from New England Nuclear. 2,5-diphenyloxazole and naphthalene were obtained from Beckman and 1,4-dioxane from J. T. Baker Chemical Co. All other reagents were of analytical grade. RESULTS

Inhibition of Maize Leaf Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxglase by Bromopyruvate. Bromopyruvate can act as a reversible competitive inhibitor of maize leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate as shown in Fig. 1. The Ki calculated from a Dixon plot (31) was 2.3 mM at pH 8. As the coupled assay was used to study the reversible inhibition by bromopyruvate, controls were made to establish that malic dehydrogenase activity was not rate limiting under each assay condition. Bromopyruvate was added just

before the assay was started with phosphoenolpyruvate and the initial activity was measured in less than a minute; under these conditions a significant inactivation of the enzyme was not observed. When the enzyme was incubated with the halo carboxylic acid, it was irreversibly inactivated in a time-dependent reaction that followed pseudo-first-order kinetics (not shown). Prolonged incubation with the reagent completely inactivated the enzyme. The inactivation was not reversed by dilution in the assay medium or by gel filtration. The addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to the incubation mixture prevented further loss of enzyme activity but did not reverse the inactivation that has already taken place (not shown). When the observed pseudo-first-order rate constants were plotted against bromopyruvate concentrations, a hyperbolic curve was obtained (Fig. 2, inset). This behavior is typical of a two-step reaction mechanism in which reversible formation of a noncovalent enzyme * inhibitor complex precedes the alkylation step: enzyme + Br-pyruvate

Eflect of Several Compound,s on the Brom~ruvate Inactivation The effect of several effecters of the carboxylase on the half-time of inactivation by bromopyruvate at pH 7.2 is shown in Table I. These results show that the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate strongly protected the enzyme against inactivation. The competitive inhibitors P-glycolate (5) and pyruvate (unpublished results), and L-malate, that interacts with the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site at this pH (11,19,21) also afforded protection. Glucose 6-phosphate, an allosteric activator, was without effect. When the effect of the mentioned metabolites was analyzed at pH 8, similar results were observed except in the case of L-malate. This hydroxyacid, which is a "noncompetitive" inhibitor at this pH (5, ll), afforded no protection at a concentration of 10 mM which is near the reported Ki value (5,11). At pH 7 the presence of 1 mM L-malate increased the half-time of inactivation caused by 2 mM bromopyruvate from 8.6 to 23.6 min; this concentration is close to the reported Ki at this pH (11). At pH 7,5 mM L-malate afforded total protec-

apparent second-order rate constant) with pH is shown in Fig. 3. A slight increase is observed in the limiting first-order rate constant when pH changes from `7to 8 (Fig. 3A). This means that the enzyme group that reacts with bromopyruvate may change its protonation state over these pH. A sulfhydryl group with pK, between 8 and 8.5 could be responsible for these changes. However, the main effect observed in this range seems to be due to a change in the binding strength between the haloketoacid and the carboxylase (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that one or more groups with pK, near 7.5 must be unprotonated for the correct binding of bromopyruvate. If pK is plotted against pH a similar curve is obtained, and of the difference between the slopes of the two linear portions a value of 2.1 is obtained (not shown); this suggests that two enzyme groups are involved in this process. The inhibition constants calculated from Dixon plots for the reversible inhibitory effect are 10 InM at pH 7 and 2.3 mM at pH 8, thus showing the same correlation.

pH 7. At pH 8, MgClz had no effect on the inactivation rate. When the carboxylase was incubated with the inactivating agent in the presence of 10 mM phosphoenolpyruvate plus 10 mM MgClz for 30 min, the catalytic activity and the sensitivity of the enzyme to malate and glucose g-phosphate were the same of those of the unmodified enzyme (not shown). Brormpyruvate Modification and Cysteinyl Residues of the Carboxylase As previously reported (19, 32), maize leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase that has not been incubated with thiol reducing agents contains eight sulfhydryl groups accessible to N-ethylmaleimide, four of them being protected when the reaction is carried out in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate. In order to determine if some of these cysteinyl residues are involved in the bromopyruvate inactivation, the number of such groups in the enzyme modified to various extents by the bromo ketoacid was established. The results are exposed on Fig. 4 and show the correlation between the percentage of inactivation achieved at different times by 1 mM bromopyruvate at pH `7 and the total incorporation of rH]-Nethylmaleimide to the modified enzyme. It can be seen that as a consequence of the inactivation the number of sulfhydryl groups that are accessible to N-ethylmaleimide modification is progressively decreased. Experiments carried out with 5,5'dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as thiol modifier also indicate that the enzyme inactivated by bromopyruvate has less reactive sulfhydryl groups than the native carboxylase (not shown). Extrapolation to 100% inactivation yields a reduction of 4 mol of N-ethylmaleimide incorporated per mole of tetramer, indicating that probably one pyruvyl residue is incorporated per enzyme subunit. When the modification by bromopyruvate was carried out in the presence of 10 mM phosphoenolpyruvate plus 10 mM MgCIz, that afforded total protection, the number of thiol groups accessible to Nethylmaleimide remained essentially unchanged at eight per enzyme molecule,

tion. It has been proposed that at pH 7 this compound interacts with the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site of the carboxylase from maize leaves (11). Significantly, MgClz increased the observed rate of inactivation by bromopyruvate and enhanced the protective effect of phosphoenolpyruvate (Table I). The latter effect is presumably due to the higher affinity of the substrate in the presence of MgClz than in its absence. The enhancement of the inactivation, observed with MnClz, too, may be a consequence of the increase of the reactivity of the enzyme toward the alkylating reagent as well as a result of a higher affinity of the enzyme . bromopyruvate complex when the divalent cation is present. The effect of MgClz at pH `7was further studied by the calculation of the parameters for the inactivation in the absence and presence of the divalent cation at a concentration of 10 mM. The presence of the cation decreased the value of K from 2 to 1.4 mM, while !&was essentially unchanged. The results indicate that the main effect of the cation is to increase the apparent affinity of the enzyme for bromopyruvate at

suggesting that no bromopyruvate incorporation takes place under these conditions at or near these cysteinyl residues.
DISCUSSION

Bromopyruvate has been extensively used as substrate analog in several enzymes which use pyruvate or phosphoenolpyruvate. In this way, the halo acid modifies active-site cysteinyl residues of 2keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconic aldolase (33), E. coli glutamate decarboxylase (34), pig-heart aspartate amine transferase (35), pyruvate-phosphate dikinase from B. sgmbiosus (26), pigeon liver malic enzyme (36), E. coli pyruvate dehydrogenase (37), and the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (39, among others. Kameshita et al. (27) demonstrated that bromopyruvate reacts with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from E. coli as an active-site-directed reagent. In a recent review, O'Leary (23) informed that the enzyme from maize was modified at the "ma-

late site" by the pyruvate analog. The bacterial and the &-plant carboxylase are different in a number of kinetic and regulatory properties (2). The present study reports that inactivation of maize leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is a consequence of the modification of activesite residues. The rapid and complete inactivation of the enzyme caused by the reagent suggests the modification of essential amino acid residues. Moreover, the competitive reversible inhibition with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate and the total protection afforded by this substrate indicate that the reacting groups are at or near the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site(s) of the enzyme. The protection data obtained with competitive inhibitors are also in agreement with this observation. The saturation kinetics observed for the inactivation by bromopyruvate are consistent with a twostep binding process. The first is a rapid noncovalent formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex between bromopyruvate and probably a positively charged group of the enzyme, followed by a slow alkylation step. The enzymatic cationic group may be the same as that which interacts with the carboxylate group of phosphoenolpyruvate and its analogs. The higher affinity of the halo acid at pH 8 (Ki: 2.3 InM; K 0.32 mM) than at pH `7 (K;: 10 mM; K 2 mM) is in agreement with the changes reported for the Michaelis constant for the binding of phosphoenolpyruvate to the carboxylase (13,14,20). The reason for the discrepancy between the values of K and Ki at both pH is not known. Similar differences between reversible and irreversible interactions of bromopyruvate with other enzymes have been already reported (26,34,36). It should be noted that they are different types of constants since K is a Michaelis constant while Ki is not. The study of the inactivation by bromopyruvate at different pH suggests that two groups of pK, near 7.5 would be involved in the binding of the reagent to the carboxylase. Previous reports in which the changes in V,, and K, for phosphoenolpyruvate with pH were studied have shown that one or more groups with this pK, value must be unprotonated for the enzyme to

bind phophoenolpyruvate (14,20). This pK, would probably correspond to imidazole groups which have been shown to be present in the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site of maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (20). This similarity between the changes in the affinity for bromopyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate with pH suggests that the halo acid is interacting with the active site of the enzyme. The effect of Me on the bromopyruvate modification of the enzyme is of interest. While at pH `7 it increases the reactivity and affinity of the inhibitor, at pH 8 the divalent cation does not enhance the inactivation. The difference between the K values obtained in the presence and absence of MgClz at pH 7, though small, is significant, and was observed in several experiments. These results differ from those of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from E. coli, in which Mtif enhanced the inactivation progressively as the pH increased (27). However, they are in agreement with the changes caused by MgClz in the dissociation constants for the maize leaf enzyme-phosphoenolpyruvate complex previously reported (21). The effect of the cation on the inactivation produced by bromopyruvate may reflect its action on the carboxyl group of these compounds, although a conformational change of the enzyme in the presence of Me cannot be ruled out. Then, while at pH 7 Me seems to interact with both the carboxyl and phosphate groups of phosphoenolpyruvate, at pH 8 the interaction with the second group would be more important. Miller et al. (39) and Miziorko et al. (22), working with the carboxylase from C8plants, found that the phosphate group is more directly involved in the formation of the complex between the enzyme, metal, and phosphoenolpyruvate or phospholactate, respectively. Our results are consistent with these reports. MgClz also increases the protection afforded by phosphoenolpyruvate against enzyme modification. This effect has been previously observed in studies with phenylglyoxal, that modifies active-site arginyl residues (21). Otherwise, MnClz does not seem to have a similar effect. An explanation of this is difficult to achieve, since

the role of this cation on the carboxylase reaction has not been studied in detail. Some differences between the effect of Mgz and Mn2+ on the enzyme activity have been reported (5, 14). Recently, it has been reported that L-malate interacts with maize leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase at both a competitive and noncompetitive site (11). The interaction with the first site is stronger at pH 7 than at pH 8 (11). Then, the effect of L-malate also indicates that active-site residues are modified by bromopyruvate, since the protection by the hydroxyacid is observed only when the reaction is carried out at pH near 7. Similar results have been obtained in chemical modification studies with other active-site reacting agents (18,19,21). The interaction of bromopyruvate with the noncompetitive malate site reported by O'Leary (28) cannot be ruled out, although this fact was not observed under our experimental conditions. It has been shown that, in model reactions at pH 7, bromopyruvate reacts mainly with the thiol group of cysteine or N-acetylcysteine, while the reaction with free histidine, methionine, and N-acetyllysine is rather slow (37). The radiochemical titration of the accessible sulfhydryl groups of the native and bromopyruvate modified enzyme at pH 7 indicates that the reagent alkylates four cysteinyl residues per enzyme molecule. These groups are not modified when the reaction with bromopyruvate is carried out in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate plus MgCl, suggesting that the previously reported essential sulfhydryl group located at the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site of the enzyme (19) may be alkylated by bromopyruvate. The presence of a curvature in Fig. 4 can be due either to unspecific modification or to changes provoked in the carboxylase as a consequence of the modification by bromopyruvate. Since in the totally protected enzyme no incorporation was observed, the second explanation seems more convenient. Another possible explanation is that more than one sulfhydryl group per subunit is essential for activity (40); however, previous studies with the maize enzyme suggest that this is not the case (19). The results reported here indicate that bromopyruvate reacts with amino acid
