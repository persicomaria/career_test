Structural and mechanistic insights into microtubule end-binding proteins
Kevin C Slep
Recent experiments reconstituting microtubule plus end tracking activity coupled with structural determination of microtubule plus end domains and plus end complexes are revealing the hierarchy, regulatory features, and potential mechanisms of plus end tracking proteins. Primary plus end tracking proteins include EB1 and XMAP215, while a host of secondary, EB1-dependent plus end proteins have been identified and characterized, including CLIP-170 and SKIPmotif proteins. Single molecule in vitro reconstitution assays show that XMAP215 is a processive polymerases that drives tubulin polymerization. Analysis of the EB1­microtubule interaction indicates EB1 actively promotes A-form microtubule lattice growth and rapidly exchanges with subsecond dwell times.

nature of these proteins and the hierarchy of plus end localization. This review serves to synergize recent structural advances with current mechanistic models of microtubule plus end tracking, outlining central questions, currently outstanding. Microtubule plus end tracking proteins can be placed into four categories based on domain composition (Figure 1a). First, EB1 family members contain an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, a C-terminal dimerization domain and an ultimate EEY motif akin to a-tubulin's conserved C-terminus [2,3]; second, cytoskeletal associated proteinglycine rich (CAP-Gly) domain-containing proteins include the p150 subunit of the dynactin complex and CLIP-170 [4]; third, SKIP-motif proteins, an EB1-binding motif found in a diverse multitude of proteins that track plus ends with EB1-dependency [5,6] and fourth, TOG domain-containing proteins including the XMAP215 and CLASP protein families [7,8]. A plus end interaction network is being elucidated, revealing the hierarchy and regulatory elements at play (Figure 1b).

EB1 structure and microtubule-binding mechanism
EB1 family members contain a conserved N-terminal domain that mediates microtubule association and a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) that confers dimerization and factor recruitment. Structure determination of the N-terminal domain revealed a CH domain fold [2]. CH domains are commonly found as tandemly arrayed Factin-binding domains. EB1 represented the first CH domain member with microtubule localization [9]. Subsequent studies of the protein CLAMP and the Ndc80 kinetochore complex have identified CH domains in these proteins that mediate microtubule association [10­12]. Structure determination of EB3 and the S. cerevisiae EB1 member, Bim1p, show the EB1 CH fold is highly conserved (Figure 2a) [13,14]. The C-terminal EB1 domain facilitates dimerization through a coiled-coil (CC)/four-helix bundle structure [3,5]. Conserved hydrophobic residues, including a signature FYF motif, are surface exposed and reside at the intersection of the CC and the four-helix bundle. Bridging the N-terminal and C-terminal domains is a linker high in serine, threonine, and proline content that lacks conserved determinants, but is essential for plus end tracking activity and, in S. cerevisiae, contains sites for Aurora B phospho-regulation [15]. While the C-terminal dimerization domain does not confer plus end tracking activity, studies indicate dimerization greatly enhances plus end localization [14,15].

Introduction
Dynamic instability is a critical feature of the microtubule cytoskeleton as it harnesses the power of dynamic form to confer dynamic function [1]. Microtubule plus end tracking proteins track the microtubule plus end, modulating microtubule dynamics and linking cellular components to the microtubule tip. This review examines developments in the structure and mechanism of microtubule plus end tracking proteins over the past two years. Recent advances in microtubule plus end protein structure determination using X-ray crystallography, NMR, and electron microscopy (EM) have produced insight into the architecture of individual domains and higher order quaternary complexes including the localization and effect one member, EB1, has on the microtubule lattice Table 1. Structural studies paralleled by in vitro microtubule plus end tracking reconstitution assays have begun to characterize the processive

Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy enabled the first observation of in vitro, reconstituted, EB1 plus end tracking activity [16]. This assay verified EB1 as a direct microtubule plus end tracking protein and opened the experimental door for systematic plus end tracking structure/function assays. How EB1 recognizes the dynamic microtubule plus end is a challenging question to address experimentally. To date, analysis has focused on the use of EM and the S. pombe EB1 protein, Mal3 [17,18]. Mal3 exhibits a higher microtubule affinity than mammalian EB1 proteins. Microtubule association is conferred by the CH domain and the central linker region and is enhanced by three acidic residues in the distal region of the central linker [18]. Attempts to decorate taxol-stabilized microtubules produced intriguing results. Addition of Mal3 to taxolstabilized microtubules produced density along the seam of B lattice microtubules, a unique lattice feature where a-tubulin and b-tubulin form lateral interactions (Figure 2b) [17]. A subsequent study examined taxolstabilized microtubules that were polymerized in the presence of Mal3 [18]. Resulting microtubules had an increased incidence of polymerizing in an A lattice configuration. In the A lattice, a-tubulin universally makes

lateral contacts with b-tubulin, reminiscent of the B lattice seam. Mal3 density was observed decorating the A lattice, localized to a-tubulin and angled over the atubulin­b-tubulin lateral interface. Additional EM and light microscopy assays indicate mouse EB1 recognizes a microtubule plus end sheet and promotes lateral subunit incorporation and sheet closure [19]. Single molecule assays show EB1 plus end localization requires a GTPhydrolysis-competent cap and that the interaction occurs with subsecond dwell times [20,21]. These findings elicit a model in which EB1 promotes tubulin incorporation (polymerization), while its ability to enhance sheet closure promotes catastrophe. All studies point to EB1 recognizing unique plus end features and promoting lateral tubulin contacts. The localization of Mal3 density in the span between protofilaments may explain why no binding has been observed between EB1 and the abtubulin heterodimer [14,22]. The Ndc80 kinetochore complex binds microtubules via CH domains in the Ndc80 and Nuf2 components [11,12]. EM of Ndc80decorated microtubules revealed density spanning longitudinal and lateral inter-ab-tubulin contacts [23]. The structure of a truncated Ndc80 complex was modeling into this density (Figure 2c). The face of the Ndc80 CH domain presented to the microtubule correlates with a

Domain structure and hierarchy of plus end tracking proteins. (a) Domain architecture of EB1, CLIP-170, XMAP215, and CLASP microtubule plus end tracking families. The EB1 family (Bim1p in S. cerevisiae) are delineated by an N-terminal calponin homology domain (CH), an EB1 domain that confers dimerization and a C-terminal EEY motif that binds CAP-Gly domains. The CLIP-170 family contains two N-terminal CAP-Gly domains, a central coiled-coil (CC) dimerization domain, tandem C-terminal Zn2+ knuckle domains that can inhibit the ability of CAP-Gly domains to bind tubulin, and a C-terminal ETF motif akin to the EEY motif found in EB1. Members of the XMAP215 family are delineated by five N-terminal TOG domains followed by a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) and are monomeric. Yeast XMAP215 members (Stu2p in S. cerevisiae) are delineated by two N-terminal TOG domains followed by a C-terminal CC dimerization domain. CLASP family members contain an N-terminal TOG domain and a Cterminal CLIP-170 binding domain (CLIP-170 BD). Spanning the intervening central region are two predicted TOG-Like domains (TOGL). (b) Hierarchical web of microtubule plus end interactions. Direct, plus end tracking activity has been reconstituted with XMAP215 and EB1 family members (green arrows). SKIP-motif proteins and the CAP-Gly-containing proteins, p150 and CLIP-170 show an EB1-dependent microtubule plus end tracking activity (blue arrows). Whether CLASP can plus end track autonomously or is EB1-dependent remains to be elucidated. Regulatory elements are depicted in red.

EB1: the plus end lynchpin
While EB1 is a primary plus end-binding protein, it is also the nexus for plus end factor recruitment. EB1 factor binding is mediated by the dimerization domain and the ultimate a-tubulin-like EEY motif [3,6,14,24,25]. Factors that EB1 recruits are classified into two groups: CAPGly domain-containing proteins and SKIP-motif proteins (Figure 3c,d). Plus end tracking CAP-Gly domain proteins include CLIP-170 and the dynactin p150 subunit. Recent work has shown that CLIP-170 and p150 plus end track in an EB1-dependent manner [20,26,27]. Structural analysis of CAP-Gly domains complexed with EB1 revealed two sites of interaction (Figure 3) [24,25]. One interaction occurs at the coiled-coil/four-helix bundle junction of EB1's dimerization domain (Figure 3a,b). A second interaction occurs between the EB1 C-terminal EEY motif and the CAP-Gly domain's hydrophobic cleft framed by the conserved GKNDG motif and the central b-sheet. Autoregulatory determinants in the EB1 C-terminus are thought to be relieved by CAP-Gly binding

[28]. CLIP-170 can bind tubulin in vitro and promote polymerization, indicative of an inherent affinity for tubulin [14,29,30]. This is not surprising given the occurrence of GAP-Gly domains in tubulin folding chaperones [31]. Recent studies, however, indicate that CAP-Gly plus end tracking is EB1-dependent [20,26,27]. CLIP170 plus end tracking activity has also been shown to be sensitive to tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) activity [32,33]. Tubulin carboxypeptidase and TTL cycle the removal and addition of a-tubulin's ultimate tyrosine residue. Given EB1 and a-tubulin each contain an EEY motif and CLIP-170 requires EB1 to plus end track, it remains to be determined if TTL regulates plus end tracking activity by modifying a-tubulin or EB1. A homologous EEY motif found in CLIP-170 (ETF), enables the foldback, autoinhibition of its CAP-Gly domain or a trans inhibition of the p150 CAP-Gly domain [34­36]. Three recent structures: CLIP-170 bound to a C-terminal atubulin peptide, p150 bound to an EB1 C-terminal peptide, and p150 bound to the C-terminal CLIP-170 inhibitory region show a common mode of CAP-Gly-EEY motif binding (Figure 3e) [25,29,35,36]. The second group of EB1-recruited factors are defined by a SKIP motif that binds the EB1 dimerization domain.

The site, first identified in the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, was refined as additional EB1-dependent plus end tracking factors were found, including MACF2, melanophilin, STIM1, and CDK5RAP2 [5,37­40]. The structure of a MACF2 SKIP peptide bound to EB1 revealed an extended peptide with the SKIP-motif flanking, in parallel, the helices of the EB1 four-helix bundle (Figure 3a) [6]. Similar to CAP-Gly domains, two SKIP peptides can symmetrically bind the EB1 dimerization domain. Comparison of SKIP motif and CAP-Gly binding determinants reveals overlap indicative that single site occupancy is mutually exclusive. CAP-Gly domains may toggle off the EB1 dimerization domain upon SKIP-motif binding but remain tethered through EEY motif interactions. The symmetric structure of the EB1 dimerization domain affords two binding sites, indicative that diverse factors can be recruited simultaneously. The EB1 determinants for CAP-Gly and SKIP-motif binding are composed of residues from each chain of the homodimer. The recently identified EB1­EB3 heterodimer creates nonidentical binding sites that may afford unique, asymmetric factor recruitment [13].

Structure and mechanism of TOG domain proteins
Two plus end tracking families defined by XMAP215 and CLASP contain arrays of TOG domains. The XMAP215 family is the second group shown to have primary plus end tracking activity in vitro [41]. The XMAP215 family can be divided into two groups based on domain architecture: lower eukaryotic yeast members have tandem Nterminal TOG domains followed by a basic microtubulebinding region and a coiled-coil homodimerization domain (Figure 1a) [42,43]. Higher eukaryotic members are monomeric with five arrayed N-terminal TOG domains and a conserved CTD [7]. TOG domains have tubulin-binding activity and are composed of six HEAT repeats [7,14,44,45]. Highly conserved intra-HEAT

The structures of human EB1 (orange), EB3 (dark gray), and S. cerevisiae Bim1p (light gray) superimposed (right), revealing a high degree of structural identity across the EB1 family. The conserved, C-terminal EB1 dimerization domain is formed through a coiled-coil that folds back at its C-terminal region to form a four-helix bundle. The interface between the coiled-coil and the four-helix bundle contains a signature FYF motif involved in SKIP-motif binding.

loops span one face of the molecule and delineate the tubulin-binding site (Figure 4a­c). Recent work has shown that XMAP215 members undergo a dramatic conformation change upon binding tubulin [41,44]. The stoichiometry of interaction has been determined at 2:1 for S. cerevisiae (Stu2p:tubulin) and 1:1 for Xenopus (XMAP215:tubulin) (Figure 4d). An XMAP215 tubulin polymerase model has been developed in which multiple TOG domains with tubulin-binding activity envelop a single tubulin heterodimer. Using microtubule-binding activity conferred by the C-terminal tail, the loaded XMAP215 molecule delivers a single tubulin heterodimer to the microtubule plus end, cycling through an undefined tubulin bind-and-release mechanism coordinated with processive translocation along the microtubule (Figure 4e). This contrasts with earlier models in which XMAP215 templates the en block addition of multiple tubulin heterodimers to the microtubule plus end [14,46,47]. The CLASP plus end tracking family was originally isolated as a CLIP-170 associated protein [8]. Initial composition analysis indicated an N-terminal TOG domain, a central SKIP motif, and a C-terminal CLIP170 binding domain. Secondary structure prediction of the central region revealed two conserved regions, each composed of 12 helices, reminiscent of the dodecahelical content of TOG domains. While the helices show no homology with TOG domains, alternating loop segments contain the conserved elements that delineate TOG domain-tubulin-binding determinants [14]. Thus, it is predicted that CLASP has two additional, divergent, TOG-like domains that have retained tubulin-binding activity. Arrayed TOG domains may underlie a common plus end tracking mechanism for XMAP215 and CLASP.

Conclusions
While the plus end tracking field continues to move forward rapidly, structural and mechanistic insight is still in a nascent state. Of central interest is deciphering the microtubule plus end features EB1 and TOG proteins recognize: a GTP cap, an open sheet, a unique lattice or a combination therein. Future EM experiments will have to examine TOG proteins at the microtubule plus end, as well as higher eukaryotic EB1 members to ensure Mal3 observations translate universally. Structure determination of TOG­tubulin complexes will illuminate the GTP-bound, prepolymerization conformational of tubulin and provide mechanistic insight into the TOG­tubulin processive interaction. In vitro reconstitution assays must be used to deconvolute plus end tracking hierarchy and the concerted effect these components have on microtubule dynamics.

This study analyzes the effect of EB1 on microtubule polymerization and dynamics in vitro. Using electron cryomicroscopy, the authors find that EB1 promotes the polymerization of tubulin sheets by favoring the lateral association of free tubulin. Results also indicate that EB1 promotes tube closure and concomitantly, catastrophe. 20.

This study reconstitutes Bim1p plus end tracking in vitro and delineates Aurora B kinase regulatory elements in the central linker region that modulate plus end tracking activity. The central linker region is required for plus end tracking activity though little structure/function information is known of its mechanism or regulation. The authors show that cell-cycledependent Aurora B activity causes phosphorylation of the central linker, thus abrogating Bim1p plus end localization. 16.

This study is the first to show in vitro reconstituted microtubule plus end tracking activity. Using time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, the authors reconstitute Mal3 plus end tracking activity and show the dependence of Tip1 (CLIP-170) plus end tracking activity on Mal3. 17.

Nat Struct Mol Biol 2008, 15:1102-1108. This cryo-EM reconstruction analysis of microtubules polymerized in the presence of Mal3 indicates that Mal3 promotes polymerization of the Aform microtubule lattice. Mal3 binding is localized to the protofilament groove, associated predominantly with alpha-tubulin. 19.

scopy, the authors find XMAP215 at the plus end of both growing and shrinking microtubules. Assays indicate a 1:1 XMAP215:tubulin-binding stoichiometry and negative stain EM reveals a large conformational change in XMAP215 upon binding a single tubulin heterodimer. 42.
