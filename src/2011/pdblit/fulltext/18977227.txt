Abstract

Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering have been used to investigate structural changes upon binding of individual substrates or a transition state analogue complex (TSAC), consisting of Mg-ADP, creatine and KNO3 to creatine kinase isoenzymes (dimeric M-CK and octameric Mi-CK) and monomeric arginine kinase (AK). Considerable changes in the shape and the size of the molecules occurred upon binding of Mg-ATP and TSAC, whereas creatine alone had only a small effect. In Mi-CK, the radius of gyration was reduced from 55.6 A (free enzyme) to 48.9 A (enzyme + Mg-ATP) and to 48.2 A (enzyme + TSAC). The experiments performed with M-CK showed similar changes from 28.0 i (free enzyme) to 25.6 A (enzyme + Mg-ATP) and to 25.5 A (enzyme + TSAC). Creatine alone did not lead to significant changes in the radii of gyration, nor did free ATP or ADP. AK showed the same behaviour: a change of the radius of gyration from 21.5A (free enzyme) to 19.7 i (enzyme + MG-ATP), whereas with arginine alone only a minor change could be observed. The primary change in structure as seen with monomeric AK seems to be a magnesium-nucleotide induced domain movement relative to each other, whereas the effect of substrate may be of local order only. In creatine kinase, however, further movements must be involved in the large conformational change.

1. Introduction

Creatine kinase (CK, EC 2.7.2.3) is a key enzyme of cellular energy metabolism, catalysing the reversible phosphoryl transfer from phosphocreatine to A D P (for a review see Ref. [1]). Substrates are bound specifically in a rapid equilibrium, random

mechanism with product release being the rate limiting step under physiological conditions. In addition to the productive reaction, C K also forms a dead-end inhibition or transition state analogue complex with Mg-ADP, nitrate, and creatine (TSAC). C K is present in vertebrate cells of high and fluctuating energy demand, e.g. muscle fibres, neurons, photoreceptors, spermatozoa, or electrocytes, where it regenerates ATP from phosphocreatine during cellular work. Several isoforms of the enzyme have been reported, cytosolic (M, muscle type; B, brain type) and mitochondrial isoenzymes.

Three cytosolic isoenzymes exist in homo- or heterodimeric form (BB-, MB- and M M - C K ) and two mitochondrial CKs occur mainly as octamers (Mia- and Mib-CK) [2]. C K is a member of the family of guanidino kinases (ATP-guanidinophosphotransferases), enzymes with closely related primary sequences and large structural similarities [3]. Lobster arginine kinase (AK, EC 2.7.3.3) is another member of this family being a monomeric protein of 40 kDa, while the cytosolic forms of C K can be regarded either as dimeric members of this protein family, having relative molecular masses of 86 kDa, or as octamers of 340 kDa, that can be dissociated into dimers in vitro, as found for Mi-CK. Mi-CKs have been found in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria, being attached to the inner membrane [4]. The enzyme is thereby enabled to utilize intramitochondrially synthesized ATP for the synthesis of phosphocreatine which is shuttled out of the mitochondria for the regeneration of ATP by the cytosolic C K isoenzymes. This interplay of mitochondrial and cytosolic CKs has been referred to as the "phosphocreatine circuit" [1]. Mi-CK has been crystallized in our laboratory [5] and its X-ray structure has been solved [6]. The C K monomer displays a two-domain organization, with a small N-terminal (residues 1-100) and a large C-terminal domain (residues 120-380). The latter is dominated by a large cluster of antiparallel /3-strands, surrounded by several a-helices, whereas the N-terminal domain exhibits helical structure elements only. Furthermore, a single /3-strand formed by amino acids 121-130 separates the large /3-sheet of the C-terminal domain into two halves which, together with their surrounding structures, can be regarded as subdomains of the C-domain [C1 = (166-236), C2 = (287-316)]. Extensive m o n o m e r - m o n o m e r contacts allow for the formation of stable dimers from two Mi-CK monomers, whereas the dimers interact with each other only weakly, forming octameric assemblies. A K has been shown to undergo a decrease of the radius of gyration upon binding of Mg-ADP or Mg-ATP which is consistent with a hinge rotation of two domains [7]. To test the existence of such conformational changes in creatine kinase upon ligand binding we have performed small-angle

X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) experiments. This approach offered a possibility to interpret data obtained by solution scattering based on the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Protein sources and sample preparation

Chicken sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (Mib-CK) was isolated from the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS transformed with the expression vector pRF23 and expressing the heterologous protein as described previously [8]. Rabbit muscle creatine kinase (M-CK) and lobster tail arginine kinase (AK) were obtained from commercial sources (Boehringer Mannheim and Sigma, respectively). In some experiments, recombinant chicken muscle creatine kinase (M-CK) was used that had been isolated from E. coli transformed with an expression vector bearing the cDNA coding for this isoenzyme [19]. All protein preparations were homogeneous as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. [9] using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Before use, proteins were dialysed against 100 m M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 5 mM t3-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mM EDTA. For SAS measurements, final protein concentrations of 15, 7.5, 5 and 3 mg m1-1 were used. The transition state analogue complex (TSAC) consisted of 4 m M ADP, 5 mM MgCI2, 20 mM creatine and 50 mM KNO3 (final concentrations). ATP was used at a final concentration of 20 mM with 20 mM MgC12 present.
2.2. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments

All SAXS experiments were performed using a Kratky camera [10] with a theromostatted sample holder at 10°C or 20°C using a quartz capillary with a volume of 60 #1 and an internal diameter of 1.0 mm. The primary X-ray beam of 1.542 ,& wavelength was produced by a water cooled rotating anode generator. The camera was equipped

of free Mi-CK and differs significantly from that of Mi-CK + Mg-ATP. Creatine alone did not lead to significant changes in the radii of gyration, nor did free ATP or ADP, although X-ray crystallography revealed that ATP or a non-hydrolysable analogue ( A M P - P N P ) binds to the enzyme even in the absence of Mg 2+. SANS experiments performed with Mi-CK basically yielded the same results in the range of experimental error. A K showed the same behaviour, a change of the radius of gyration from 21.5 ,~ (free enzyme) to 19.7 A (enzyme + Mg-ATP), whereas with arginine alone only a minor change could be observed (data not show, see also Ref. [7]). All SAXS measurements were performed at two different temperatures, either at 10°C or at 20°C. No significant differences in the scattering behaviour of respective samples were observed at the two temperatures. To control our samples for the existence of protein aggregates, we determined the relative molecular masses (Mr) of the proteins from the scattering profiles. M r is related to the normalized intensity extrapolated to zero-angle [in(0)] [14]. This relation shows no dependence on protein concentration in our experiments. The values obtained for the molecular masses from the values of in(0) for M - C K and Mi-CK did not differ significantly from the data obtained by biochemical methods. We therefore conclude that no protein aggregation occurred either as a function of protein concentration or upon ligand binding (data not shown).

4. Discussion

Our small-angle scattering measurements indicate that creatine kinase isoenzymes undergo major conformational changes upon ligand binding which are large enough to affect both radii of gyration and maximal diameter of the proteins. Interestingly, binding of ATP or ADP in the absence of Mg 2+ did not lead to a significant change in the size or shape of either of the enzymes examined. We know, however, from X-ray crystallography that free ATP or non-hydrolysable analogues thereof (e.g. A M P - P N P ) can bind to

Mi-CK. Therefore, we calculated the scattering profile of Mi-CK in the presence of bound ATP from the coordinates obtained by X-ray crystallography and compared it to the experimentally derived scattering curves. From this experiment one can conclude that the three-dimensional structure of Mi-CK in the presence of ATP resembles the structure of free Mi-CK in solution, which is significantly different from that of Mi-CK in the presence of either Mg-ATP or TSAC. Further, it is obvious that ATP or ADP alone cannot induce a significant conformational change in Mi-CK but that Mg 2+ is needed for this transition to occur. This is of great importance for the interpretation of the three-dimensional structure of Mi-CK, especially in terms of the elucidation of the catalytic pathway. We propose to call the conformations of free M-CK and Mi-CK " o p e n " conformations, whereas those in the presence of Mg-ATP or TSAC should be considered as "closed" conformations. Arginine kinase also showed a decrease in Rg of 1.2 ,~ upon binding of Mg-ATP which is consistent with the results of Dumas and Janin [7] for this enzyme. Similar experiments have been performed with other enzymes from different protein families, e.g. both yeast hexokinase [15] and yeast phosphoglycerate kinase [16] exhibit a decrease of their radii of gyration of similar magnitude. From crystallographic studies of hexokinase, crystallized in the presence or absence of glucose, the nature of this conformational change is known [17,18]. A domain movement of one of the two domains in hexokinase by a rotation of 10 ° relative to the other, resulting in a movement of up to 9 .~, in combination with a closure of the cleft where glucose is bound, is responsible for the conformational change. Calculations of the solution scattering profiles of the different protein conformations and comparison with the experimental data showed that the changes in Rg are the same, confirming the existence of the domain movements in solution [15]. Dumas and Janin [7] concluded from their data that a similar movement might cause the conformational change in arginine kinase, although magnesium-nucleotide rather than arginine binding induced the domain movement. Although, so far, we have not been able to obtain

crystallographic data of M i - C K in the presence of M g - A T P or TSAC, we tried to calculate scattering profiles for a closed conformation of M i - C K by rotating the domains relative to each other in the same order of magnitude as seen with hexokinase and as suggested for AK. Although a decrease in the calculated Rg values was obtained, it was not as large as seen experimentally. Even if further movements of the C 1 and C2 subdomains are considered, this does not lead to the pronounced changes observed. We therefore conclude that another type of movement must be involved in the large conformational changes observed for Mi-CK. This might be a movement of the dimeric building blocks of the octamer relative to each other, thereby also inducing the change in globularity observed upon ligand binding. We hope that with the emergence of a high resolution three-dimensional structure of M i - C K in the presence of substrates, we might be able to fully interpret the experimentally obtained small-angle scattering curves.
