Abstract--The discovery of novel 5,7-disubstituted[1,6]naphthyridines as potent inhibitors of Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK) is discussed. The SAR reveals the necessity for a 7-aryl group with preference towards para substitution and that this in combination with 5-aminoalkylamino substituents further improved the potency of the compounds. The initial SAR as well as a survey of the other positions is discussed in detail. # 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction Asthma and allergic disorders remain areas with unmet medical needs. Mast cells play an important part in the pathophysiology of these disorders by releasing proinflammatory mediators and cytokines. Activation of mast cells by antigen-mediated aggregation of FceRI (the high-affinity receptor for IgE) results in a series of signaling events leading to the release of mediators, including histamine, proteases, leukotrienes and cytokines. These mediators play key roles in the etiology and symptoms of asthma and allergic disorders. A crucial downstream event in the signaling pathway following the activation of mast cells is activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK).1À3 SYK acts as a central initiator of the FceRI-mediated signaling pathways and has been shown to be necessary for antigen-induced mediator release.3,4 It has been shown that clustering of SYK chimera, introduced into a transmembrane protein in a mast cell line, was sufficient to stimulate the events leading to mediator release normally induced by clustering of FceRI and that these events were dependent on

the kinase activity of SYK.4 A mast cell line lacking SYK was unable to signal without transfection of active SYK.5 Additionally, inhibition of the antigen-stimulated phosphorylation of SYK by piceatannol (a nonselective SYK inhibitor) inhibited functional responses in mast cells, including mediator release.6 These findings support the hypothesis that inhibiting SYK activity would attenuate FceRI-mediated release of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines from mast cells. As part of our continuing efforts to identify new therapeutics directed at asthma and allergic disorders we sought to find novel inhibitors of SYK. Compound 1 and its analogue 2 were identified as a potentially interesting series for further SAR work which is the subject of this report (Fig. 1).

Results and Discussion General chemistry The compounds were synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. A 2-methylnicotinic acid derivative (I) is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) in THF at about À78 to 0  C to form the dianion.7 Subsequent addition of a nitrile (II) at À78  C, and continuing the reaction at

8-positions (data not shown), resulted in compounds with generally reduced potency. While the 3-position tolerated small substituents like bromo (13) and methyl (data not shown), larger substituents like phenyl were considerably less potent. Based on the initial SAR we focused on determining the SAR of the 5-amino and 7-aryl substituents more thoroughly. We undertook an analysis of the substituent tolerance at the ortho, meta and para positions of the 7-phenyl group (Table 2). It was quickly discerned that ortho substitution was not tolerated (16­18). Small meta substituents generally had little effect on potency (19­22) while larger aryl substituents (23­24) led to less potent compounds. The para position proved to be the most fruitful avenue of exploration with a larger variety of substituents being tolerated. The para-position appears to have both a steric requirement and an electronic component. Small electron withdrawing substituents

ambient temperature until completion provides the [1,6]naphthyridin-5-ol (III), which may also exist as the tautomeric 6H-[1,6]naphthyridin-5-one (IIIa).8 The [1,6]naphthyridin-5-ol is then treated with POCl3, with or without base (i.e., N,N-diethylaniline) at 100­135  C, to give the 5-chloro-[1,6]naphthyridine (IV). This is then reacted with an excess of the desired amine (R0 R00 NH) at 100­140  C, in a sealed reaction vessel, to provide the 5-amino substituted compounds (V) shown in the tables.9 Alternatively, the 5-substituted ethers were available by reacting IV with the desired alcohol (R0 OH), in the presence of sodium hydride in DMF at room temperature to give ethers VI. Structure­activity relationships A rapid survey of the molecule was undertaken to determine the best path for further SAR studies (Table 1).10 Compounds 1­5 show that the [1,6]naphthyridine core system is essential for maintaining potency. The 5-amino substituent appeared to directly correlate with activity (compounds 1, 2, 6, 7) and appeared to be a good site for further exploration. Most notably, the requirement for a substituted amine and the dependence of activity on chain length was observed. The 7-aryl moiety also appeared essential. Replacement by t-butyl (8) and other alkyl substituents resulted in loss of activity. While variation of the 7-aryl group could be beneficial (9), substitution at the 2-position, as well as the 4-, and

like fluoro and chloro (25­26) were detrimental to activity however small electron donating groups like methyl (35) and methoxy (7) were beneficial. The p-dimethylamino (29) is preferred to the isosteric p-isopropyl (37) group indicating that the nitrogen, as well as the oxygen and sulfur atom of 7 and 36, might be acting additionally as hydrogen bond acceptors. Further exploration of the p-amino substituent showed that larger substitution can be beneficial in conjunction with an additional polar functionality. For example, the p-morpholino compound 31 shows an IC50 less than 10 nM. There also appears to be a size restriction as shown by 32 and 33. We next explored SAR at the 5-position. Since we had already determined that an unsubstituted amine (6) was weakly active, the next step was to determine the effects of substitution (Table 3). Compound 39 showed that disubstitution on nitrogen was permitted albeit with slight loss in activity. 5-Aminoalkylamines of 3 to 4 carbons in length were optimal. A clear preference for propylenediamine and butylenediamine is shown by comparing 10, 29, 40, and 41. Examining substitution of the diamino group showed that both amines could be replaced individually or together by oxygen (42­44) with approximately a log loss in potency. Monomethylation of the propylenediamine at either nitrogen was tolerated (45­46). However, either di- or trimethylation resulted in a $ 10­100-fold loss in activity (47­ 49). Substitution of the central carbon of the propylenediamine was also tolerated (50­51). Other groups such as cyclohexylmethylamino (52) proved detrimental.

The key to activity proved to be the proper positioning of the second basic amine group. Compare compounds 53 and 55 to 57 (which can be considered ring constrained versions of 41). The loss of activity in 57 is likely a result of both positioning as well as the basicity of the distal amine.

Conclusions It has been shown that suitable 5,7-disubstituted[1,6]naphthyridines are potent inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase SYK. The SAR has shown that a 7-aryl and preferably para-substituted aryl group as well as 5-alkyldiamines have synergistic effects on activity. The potencies ranged from high micromolar to low nanomolar. These compounds are of further interest and additional SAR and biological evaluations will be the subject of future reports.

The kinase activity was measured using DELFIA (Dissociation Enhanced Lanthanide Fluoroimmunoassay). The kinase assay was performed in buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 50 mM KCl, 100 mM Na3VO4, 0.2% BSA, 0.01% CHAPS). Test samples initially dissolved in DMSO at 5 mg/mL, were pre-diluted for dose response with the assay buffer in 96-well microtiter plates and a 25 mL aliquots of these diluted samples were added to a neutravidin coated 96-well white plate (PIERCE). A 25 mL volume of diluted enzyme (0.6 ng/mL final conc.) and a 50 mL volume of a mixture of substrates containing 200 nM ATP and 3.6 ng/mL PGTYR-biotin (CIS Biointernational) in the assay buffer was sequentially added and the assay plates were incubated for 30 min at RT. Following incubation, the plates were washed three times with 300 mL wash buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2% BSA). A 100 mL aliquot of Eu-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine (Eu3+-PT66, Wallac CR04-100) diluted in DELFIA Assay Buffer (1 nM final conc.) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at rt. The plates were washed four times with 300 mL of wash buffer and 100 mL of DELFIA Enhancement Solution (Wallac) was added to each well. After 10 min or longer, timeresolved fluorescence was measured on the LJL's Analyst (excitation at 360 nm, emission at 620 nm, EU 400 Dichroic Mirror) after a delay time of 250 ms.
