Abstract A series of tetrapeptide p-nitroanilide substrates of the general formula: suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Aaa-p-nitroanilide was used to map the S1 binding pocket of human cathepsin G. Based on the kcat /Km parameter, the following order of preference was found: Lys = Phe s Arg = Leu s Met s Nle = Nva s Ala s Asp. Thus, the enzyme exhibits clear dual and equal trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like specificities. Particularly deleterious were L-branched side chains of Ile and Val. The P1 substrate preferences found for cathepsin G are distinctly different from many other serine proteinases, including fiddler crab collagenase and chymotrypsin. The kcat /Km values obtained for P1 Lys, Phe, Arg and Leu substrates correlate well with those determined for analogous P1 mutants of basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) obtained through recombinant techniques. To characterise the subsite specificity of the enzyme, a series of Cucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor I (CMTI I) mutants were used comprising P2 ^P3 P and P12 P positions. All the mutants obtained were inhibitors of cathepsin G with association constants in the range: 105 ^109 M31 . Some of the mutations destabilised complex formation. In particular, Met8 CArg substitution at P3 P, which increased association constant for chymotrypsin 46-fold, led to a 7-fold decrease of binding with cathepsin G. In addition, mutation of Ile6 at position P1 P either to Val or Asp was deleterious for cathepsin G. In two cases (Ala18 CGly (P12 P) and Pro4 CThr (P2 )), about a 10-fold increase in association constants was observed. ß 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Human cathepsin G (catg) (EC 3.4.21.20) is a serine proteinase belonging to the chymotrypsin family, which is accumulated in the azurophyl granules of polymorphonuclear leucocytes [1,2]. Together with similarly localised human neutrophil elastase (hne) and proteinase 3, catg represents a major class of enzymes utilised in the phagocythic pathways to degrade foreign organisms and dead tissues during in£ammatory reactions [3]. Controlled physiologically by a serpin, K1 -antichy-

motrypsin, cathepsin G was considered to exhibit chymotrypsin-like speci¢city [4,5]. More recent studies on substrates [6] and inhibitors [7] indicated that not only the bulky hydrophobic side chains of Phe, Leu, Met can be accepted in the S1 pocket, but also the basic side chains of Lys and Arg (numbering S1 , P1 etc. according to [8]). A very recently published Xray structure of the complex between human cathepsin G and peptidyl phosphonate inhibitor Suc-ValPro-PheP -(OPh)2 showed that the speci¢city is determined by the presence of Glu226 which is situated at the bottom of the S1 pocket and is capable of interacting either with the basic side chain of Lys or with an edge of the aromatic ring of Phe [9]. It should be noted, however, that protein engineering studies on conversion of trypsin to a chymotrypsin-like enzyme showed that ¢fteen substitutions, mainly in the regions which are not involved in direct contacts with the substrate, are necessary to obtain a chymotrypsin-like enzyme [10]. In this systematic study, we applied a series of tetrapeptide substrates and protein inhibitors to quantitatively investigate the speci¢city of human cathepsin G. Oligopeptide p-nitroanilide substrates are frequently used to obtain information about the free energy level of the enzyme-substrate transition state. Protein inhibitors bind to the active sites of serine proteinases and respective association constants provide information about the association energy [11].

P1 mutants of basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) were used to probe the energy of interactions between the P1 side chain of the inhibitor and the S1 pocket of catg. Wild type BPTI inhibits catg only moderately (association constant Ka = 3.1U105 M31 at pH 8.3) [12]. To gain further insight to the di¡erences between catg and chymotrypsin speci¢cities we probed the S2 , S1 P, S2 P and S3 P sites using variants of pumpkin seeds Cucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor I (CMTI I, P1 Arg). Wild type CMTI I inhibits human cathepsin G (association constant slightly above 108 M31 at pH 8.3) [7] and is, therefore, suitable for mutagenic studies. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

zymes (T4 polymerase, T4 ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase) were from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany), DNA sequencing kit from Amersham (UK) and DNA puri¢cation kit from QIAGEN (USA). Oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized by Ransom Hill Biosciences (USA). IPTG and enzyme substrates were from Bachem Feinchemikalien (Switzerland). Cathepsin G was puri¢ed by a¤nity chromatography on immobilised CMTI I and BPTI inhibitors [13]. Bovine chymotrypsin was from Worthington Biochemical (USA). All other reagents were of the analytical or HPLC grade purity. 2.2. Substrates Series of suc-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Aaa-4-nitroanilides (where Aaa denotes either: Phe, Arg, Lys, Leu, Met, Ile, Ala, Val, Asp, Glu, Nva, Nle) from Bachem (Switzerland). 4-Nitrophenyl 4P-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB) was from Merck (Germany). 2.3. Expression and puri¢cation of BPTI and CMTI I mutants All BPTI and CMTI I mutants used in this study were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS, using the T7 system [14], as described previously [15,16]. Oxidation of BPTI and CMTI I variants (1034 M protein concentration) was performed in 20 mM Tris, GSH/GSSG 6U1034 / 3U1034 M, respectively, pH 8.7 in the presence of 1 mM EDTA, 4 M urea for 1 h at 45³C. Folded protein was puri¢ed on semi-preparative Vydac C18 column using an HPLC system. Solvents A (0.1% TFA in H2 O) and B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) were mixed with a linear gradient of 10^60% solvent B (1.5 ml/min £ow). 2.4. Mass spectrometry Electrospray mass spectrometry of all genetic variants used in this study was performed with a Finnigan MAT TSQ-700 equipped with ESI source (USA). Species were assigned according to their molecular masses. Samples were dissolved in methanol/ water mixture (1:1) containing 1% of acetic acid. Molecular masses of all variants were within 1.0 atomic mass unit from the expected values.

2.5. Standardisation of enzyme, inhibitor and substrate stock solutions Bovine L-trypsin and K-chymotrypsin were dissolved in 1 mM HCl, 20 mM CaCl2 to obtain the stock of about 1U1034 M. A 6U1035 M solution of cathepsin G was prepared in 0.05 M acetate bu¡er, 1 M NaCl, pH 5.5. The exact concentrations of enzyme stock solutions were determined by NPGB titration [17]. Inhibitors were prepared in 1 mM HCl. Concentrations of all BPTI variants were determined spectrophotometrically, assuming a molar absorbance coe¤cient of 5720 M31 cm31 at 275 nm for BPTI [18]. The exact concentrations of CMTI I variants were estimated either spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 276 nm of a protein solution in 1 mM HCl (O276 = 1450 M31 cm31 ) or, in case of strong inhibitors, by titrating the inhibitor with NPGB-titrated trypsin. All substrates were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). 4-Nitrophenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride (NPGB) was dissolved in 20% acetonitrile in DMSO. Substrate concentrations were determined by complete hydrolysis with trypsin, chymotrypsin, subtilisin BPNP or elastase (depending on the substrate) using the molar absorbance coe¤cient of released p-nitroaniline O412 = 8480 M31 cm31 [19]. 2.6. Kinetic parameters Steady-state parameters kcat and Km for the hydrolysis of 12 cathepsin G substrates were determined in 100 mM Tris, 20 mM CaCl2 , 0.5 M (or 3 M) NaCl, pH 8.3. The linear release of 4-nitroaniline was followed for about 400 s (in case of insensitive substrates up to 10 000 s) at 412 nm with diode array spectrophotometer HP 8452A. The slope of substrate autolysis was subtracted from all data points. The calculated initial rates (v) of the reaction were ¢tted employing non-linear least squares analysis to the Briggs^Haldane equation using GraFit (Sigma, USA). The ¢nal volume of the reaction mixture (1000 Wl) included 1U1038 ^1U1036 M catg (depending on the substrate). The substrate concentrations varied from 0.1 to about 3 Km .

2.7. Equilibrium association constants The equilibrium association constants were determined in 0.1 M Tris, 20 mM CaCl2 , 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.3 at 22³C using a described procedure [11,20]. Increasing amounts of inhibitor were added to the constant amount of cathepsin G and after suitable incubation time the residual enzyme activity was measured using turn-over substrate suc-Ala-AlaPro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. The experimental data were ¢tted to the equation: E  0X5UfE o 3F UI o 3K 31  a q E o   F UI o   K 31 2 34UE o UF UI o g a 1

where [Eo ] and [Io ] are the total enzyme and inhibitor concentrations, respectively, [E] is the residual enzyme concentration, and F is the enzyme-inhibitor equimolarity factor. 3. Results 3.1. The P1 substrate speci¢city of cathepsin G A series of 12 substrates of the general formula suc-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Aaa-p-nitroanilide (where Aaa denotes either Asp, Glu, Arg, Lys, Ala, Val, Nva, Ile, Leu, Nle, Met or Phe) were used in a systematic study (Table 1). For 9 of them, kinetic parameters could be determined. Unfortunately, catg activity towards the P1 Ile, Val and Glu substrates was so low, that, despite prolonged incubation, only kcat and Km limits could be estimated (below 5U1034 s31 and above 8U1032 M, respectively). Regarding the kcat /Km parameter, substrates which exhibit measurable reactivity can be grouped into three categories. For P1 Lys and Phe, the kcat /Km index is higher than 1000 M31 s31 . Clearly, these two strikingly different amino acid residues are best recognized by catg. Five substrates (P1 = Arg, Leu, Met, Nle, Nva) exhibit kcat /Km values between 100 and 400 M31 s31 . The two poorest substrates are P1 = Ala and Asp (kcat /Km values 1.59 and 0.77 M31 s31 , respectively). Thus, the measurable range of kcat /Km values spans over three orders of magnitude. The e¡ects on the kcat /Km values are due to changes in

kcat (4 orders of magnitude), rather than in Km (one order of magnitude). A single amino acid substrate (suc-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide) was completely ine¡ective with the kcat /Km value below 6U1033 M31 s31 (data not shown). This means that the tetrapeptide substrate suc-LAla-L-Ala-Pro-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide was over 5 orders of magnitude more reactive, which suggests that catg, like most other endopeptidases, uses extended binding sites energy to accelerate substrate hydrolysis. As catg preparation used in this study is of natural, and not of recombinant origin, the question can be risen, whether in some cases (particularly when kcat /Km for a particular substrate was very low) the observed substrate speci¢city was a genuine feature of catg and not a result of other proteinase(s) contamination. Two other major components of azurophyl granules of polymorphonuclear leucocytes are neutrophil elastase (hne) and proteinase 3. Since we observed neither the hydrolysis of P1 Val and Ile substrates, which are the best ones for neutrophil elastase [21], nor Ala and (again) Val which are believed to be optimal for proteinase 3 [22], we assume that this ensures the validity of the speci¢city pro¢le presented in this paper. To stabilise the enzyme and prevent its adhesion to spectrophotometric cuvettes, particularly during lengthy measurements, all catg measurements reported in this paper were performed in the presence

of 0.5 M NaCl. Tanaka et al. reported an activating e¡ect of molar concentrations of NaCl on cathepsin G activity [4]. We observed that upon addition of 3 M NaCl catalytic parameters for chymotrypsin change from: kcat = 13.3 s31 , Km = 5.8U1035 M, kcat /Km = 2.3U105 M31 s31 without NaCl to kcat = 16 s31 ; Km = 1.1U1035 M, kcat /Km = 1.5U106 M31 s31 for suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide substrate. Therefore, the salt in£uence on catg activity was checked by repeating kcat /Km measurements for all suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Aaa-p-nitroanilides in the presence of 3 M NaCl. This amount of NaCl leads to slightly lower Km and kcat values (Table 1). These two e¡ects cancel out in kcat /Km parameters. 3.2. Interaction of P1 variants of BPTI with cathepsin G To further characterise the P1 speci¢city of catg, P1 mutants of BPTI were tested for the antiproteinase activity. It seemed reasonable that at least a few other P1 -substituted variants could be used to determine the P1 speci¢city of the enzyme. Altogether, ¢ve such BPTI variants were expressed in E. coli, puri¢ed, and analysed for their homogeneity. The Ka values for their and the wild type interaction with human cathepsin G are summarised in Table 2. Four of them exhibited measurable binding to cathepsin G, for the other two, only the limits can be estimated. Wild type BPTI exhibits the strongest Ka value: 1.43U106 M31 . A similar association constant was found for the P1 -Phe mutant (Fig. 1). About an order of magnitude lower association constants were determined for P1 -Leu and P1 -Arg mutants. A very

weak inhibition were also detected for valyl and isoleucyl mutants. In these two cases we can only conclude that association constants are below 5U103 M31 . Fig. 2 presents a direct comparison of the transition state energies, expressed in log (kcat /Km ) with log Ka values obtained. Data for the four P1 residues correlate well between inhibitors and substrates which indicates that both of them can be used as probes of the S1 speci¢city. 3.3. Squash inhibitor mutants Apart from investigating the S1 speci¢city, the subsite preference of catg was as well tested and compared to that of chymotrypsin. To achieve this, several variants of squash inhibitor CMTI I were prepared. CMTI I was chosen because its wild type inhibits catg with Ka = 9.05U107 M31 (Table 3), hence it o¡ers a broad dynamic range of measured association constants. Since the wild type CMTI I inhibits chtp weakly (Ka = 4.04U104 M31 ) (Table 3), we introduced the Arg5 CLeu mutation ¢rst to facilitate the comparison of both proteinases. This mutation leads to a 55-fold increase of association constant with chtp and has virtually no e¡ect on catg binding (Table 3). We introduced several mutations in the P2 ^P3 P region which are known in other protein inhibitors to contribute positively to the association energy with chymotrypsin [23,24]. Additionally, we mutated Ala18 (P12 P) which is well out-

The values were determined in 0.1 M Tris, 20 mM CaCl2 , 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.3 at 22³C. Position Met52 was mutated to Leu in all mutants except Lys15 BPTI. Errors in Ka values are þ 30%.

The values were determined in 0.1 M Tris, 20 mM CaCl2 , 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.3 at 22³C. In all CMTI I mutants position P3 P (Met) was mutated to Leu as described in [16].

side the contact region and remains in the strained conformation both in the complex with trypsin (torsion angles P = 55³ and B = 3127³) [25] and in the free state (P = 45³ and B = 3150³) [26]. Since, in several cases, we introduced multiple mutations, we assumed that free energy e¡ects are additive, i.e. that the e¡ect observed in a multiple mutant is a simple sum of single mutations [27,28]. For example, all mutants contain substitution Met8 CLeu, which was introduced to eliminate CNBr-cleavage during puri¢cation of the expressed protein. As we have shown before, this mutation has a very weak e¡ect (1.4-fold decrease for catg and 1.25-fold increase for chtp) on the association constant with the enzyme [16]. This factor was included in the calculations presented below (Table 3). All association constants determined for CMTI I mutants interacting with catg are presented in Table 3, together with calculated e¡ects of single amino acid substitutions based on the additivity assumption. In agreement with the results obtained for substrates and P1 mutants of BPTI, mutation

Arg5 CLeu at P1 increases the association constant 1.7-fold. There are two other substitutions which lead to an increase in the association constant. The Pro4 CThr mutation (P2 site) produces an inhibitor with about 8-fold higher Ka value; the Ala18 CGly mutation (15-fold higher). Mutations at P1 P (Ile6 CVal and Ile6 CAsp) and at P3 P (Met8 CArg) lead to a decrease in the association constants. It should be noticed that, in the case of P1 P, the e¡ect is much weaker when L-branching of the side-chain is preserved. Some of the mutations described above in£uence association constants with chtp di¡erently than these with catg (Table 3). In three cases, the di¡erence was signi¢cant. Particularly, the P3 P Met8 CArg substitution leads to very diverse changes in the speci¢cities of both enzymes. It results in a 46-fold increase in Ka for chtp and a 7-fold decrease for catg; therefore, the ¢nal di¡erential e¡ect between chtp and catg is 46U7 = 322-fold. The P1 Arg5 CLeu mutation similarly stabilises the complex formation with chtp much more strongly (32-fold) than with catg. The

third mutation P1 P Ile6 CAsp destabilises both complexes; however, the catg complex to a much larger extent. The di¡erential e¡ect is in this case 14-fold. Three of the introduced mutations lead to similar e¡ects on the association with both enzymes. The P1 P Ile6 CVal decreases association constants with catg and chtp about 4-fold. The P2 Pro4 CThr mutation increases association constants about 9-fold. Finally, the mutation Ala18 CGly (P12 P) stabilises both complexes about 10-fold. 4. Discussion 4.1. The origin of the S1 speci¢city of cathepsin G This paper provides quantitative and comparative data on binding of the di¡erent amino acid side chains to the S1 pocket of catg. The measurements were performed using both oligopeptide substrates and protein inhibitor mutants. Both substrates and P1 mutants of BPTI provide coherent data. A correlation plot of log (kcat /Km ) versus log Ka is linear with the correlation coe¤cient r = 0.97 and the slope s = 0.53 (Fig. 2). The value of the slope shows that interactions at the transition state energy level, regardless of hydrophobic or charged character of the substrate side chain, are somewhat more sensitive than interactions at the stable enzyme-inhibitor complex level. Similarly, simple correlations, although with di¡erent slope values, between the speci¢city indexes and the association constant values for various P1 side chains have been found for chymotrypsin [21], K-lytic protease [29], subtilisin [30] and trypsin (O. Buczek and J. Otlewski, unpublished data). A unique feature of cathepsin G is the ability to recognise both large hydrophobic and basic side chains, with a slight preference for Lys over Phe (1.3-fold) and Arg over Leu (1.1-fold) (Table 1). This makes it a very unusual proteinase since even the well-known very unspeci¢c crab collagenase (colg) discriminates 15-fold between its best P1 substrate (Arg) and the next one (Leu) [31]. Therefore, one can conclude that catg exhibits dual and (roughly) equal trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like activities. Both activities are, however, at a relatively low level, as kcat /Km ratio for the best P1 Lys substrate does not exceed 1500 M31 s31 (Table 1). Since

the enzyme, together with hne and metalloproteinases, takes part in phagocyte proteolysis, its dual speci¢city can be advantageous. The main reason for the unique speci¢city of catg seems to be the presence of Glu226 in the pocket coupled with Ala189 , Ala190 and Gly216 (Fig. 3). The acidic residue, unusual at this position in serine proteinases, is responsible for the rather negative potential of the catg pocket. According to the X-ray structure of the complex between peptidyl phosphonate inhibitor Suc-Val-Pro-PheP -(OPh)2 and cathepsin G, the side chain of Glu226 divides the S1 pocket into two compartments [9]. The speci¢city of catg toward P1 Phe results from the electrostatic interaction between the negative charge of Glu226 and aromatic ring (edge-to-edge contact of phenyl and carbonyl groups) [9]. The side chain of P1 Phe stays, however, in the outer compartment of the S1 pocket due to the partial ¢ll of its bottom by Glu226 . This may be one of the reasons for its non-optimal interactions with enzyme residues (lower catalytic rates), when compared to those of chymotrypsin. One of the carbonyl oxygens of the Glu226 side chain is ¢xed through two hydrogen bonds to Ala190 amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen, which clearly suggests that Glu226 is protonated at pH 7.0, and, therefore, possesses a very high pK value, at least when the pocket is ¢lled with the aromatic ring of Phe. Binding of the hydrophobic side chains should be, therefore, thermodynamically unfavourable, which may be the possible source of the low activity against such substrates. Accessibility of only one of the Glu226 oxygens to the substrate may cause the lower catalytic rates toward Lys and Arg basic residues. Apart from the non-optimal interactions between basic and aromatic side chains and the S1 pocket, the lack of Cys191 ^Cys220 disulphide bond can be another factor contributing to much lower values of kcat /Km indexes for catg, as compared with trypsin or chymotrypsin. We suppose that the lack of this disulphide in catg can increase the £exibility of the pocket, which can lead to weaker ground state interactions, as observed in the Cys191 CAla, Cys220 CAla trypsin mutant [32]. In agreement, Km values for oligopeptide substrates of catg are higher than 1 mM (Table 1), while those for trypsin and chymotrypsin are typically in the 1034 ^1035 M range. There are two well-described proteinases of rather

similar organisation of the S1 pocket in terms of the location of an acidic residue at position 226. The ¢rst one, human neutrophil elastase (hne), has Asp226 , Gly189 , Val190 and Val216 (Fig. 3). However, the Asp226 residue present in hne does not contribute to the speci¢city toward basic side chains as it is shielded from the exterior of the pocket by the side chains of Val190 and Val216 [33]. Another clear di¡erence between catg and hne pockets is that catg prefers linear over L-branched side chains. Nle/Ile and Nva/Val ratios of respective kcat /Km indexes are extremely high, over 20 000-fold (Table 1). The respective ratios for hne are 0.047 and 0.71 [21]. The huge negative discrimination of L-branched side chains can result from a relatively narrow entrance to the S1 pocket. Particularly substitution of Val213 , present in catg, with Ala213 in hne might allow easier access of L-branched amino acids. Our modelling studies show that indeed Ala present at position 213 broadens the entrance to the pocket, but Val213 also does not seem to prevent the binding of L-branched side chains. The values of Gibbs energy of transfer of a substrate hydrophobic area from water to the S1 pockets of catg and hne are also di¡erent. This is best calculated from the di¡erence in log (kcat /Km ) for short linear hydrophobic substrates which di¡er by a methylene group(s). Respective values for Nva/Ala (two methylene groups di¡erence) and Nle/Nva (single methylene group di¡erence) for cathepsin G are: 1.9 and 0 kcal/mol and for hne: 1.36 and 31.36 kcal/mol [21]. The values show that transfer of moderately long linear hydrophobic side chains to the pocket of catg is more favourable, which probably results from the deeper S1 pocket compared with hne. Crab collagenase (colg) is the second enzyme which contains an acidic residue at position 226 (Asp226 ), in addition to Gly216 , Gly189 and Thr190 (Fig. 3). The enzyme displays a broad speci¢city with about an order of magnitude preference for Arg over Phe and Leu, and a 22-fold preference for Arg over Lys [31]. Interestingly, similarly as in catg, one of the carboxylate oxygens of Asp226 accepts two hydrogen bonds from the main chain amide of Thr190 and a well ordered water molecule located at the pocket base [34]. The conformations of carboxylate 226 side chains are similar in catg and colg and also in a trypsin mutant with charge relocated to

position 226 [35]. Genuine di¡erences in speci¢cities toward basic side chains of Lys and Arg of both enzymes can result from the Glu226 CAsp substitution which limits the space available for larger Arg. Accordingly, the ratio of (kcat /Km )Lys to (kcat /Km )Arg is low for collagenase (0.045) [31] and much higher for catg (3.80). The two amino acid insertion following Gly216 which makes the colg S1 pocket larger in is an additional factor contributing to Arg preference. The reasons for the colg activity towards P1 hydrophobic substrates are less clear. The broad speci¢city might result from a substantial £exibility of the S1 pocket which is able to adjust to di¡erent shapes of P1 side chains. The conformation of the residue 216 backbone has been recently found to be linked to the S1 pocket speci¢city [10]. This position forms two main chainmain chain hydrogen bonds to the substrate P3 residue. It was, therefore, interesting to compare the values of catg dihedral angle at Gly216 with those of trypsin and chymotrypsin as for the two latter enzymes they di¡er signi¢cantly. The B and i angles adopt in catg unique values: 3153.7³ and 3168.1³, respectively. The values are rather similar to those of panspeci¢c colg (3173.7³ and 3168.1³, respectively), but clearly di¡erent from those of trypsin (163.5³ and 169.9³), chymotrypsin (174.5³ and 3133.5³) and hne (3118.2³ and 3113.5³). It might be suggested, therefore, that catg and colg (proteinases of dual trypsinand chymotrypsin-like speci¢cities) adopt a unique set of dihedral angles at Gly216 . 4.2. The subsite speci¢cities of cathepsin G Despite pronounced activity toward P1 Lys and Arg substrates, cathepsin G is generally considered to be a chymotrypsin-like enzyme [4,36]. However, catg appears to be quite di¡erent also in its subsite speci¢cities. A particularly large di¡erential e¡ect was observed at P3 P position where the Met8 CArg mutation gives a more than 300-fold di¡erential effect (Table 3). Arginine residue at P3 P is known to be favourable for the complex formation with chtp [23,24]. Molecular modelling of this mutation shows that water-mediated favourable interaction between P3 P Arg side chain and Asp64 of chtp will be broken in catg due to the steric clashes between the P3 P Arg side chain and Ile35 of catg.

Another di¡erence between catg and chtp is due to P1 P Ile6 CVal and Ile6 CAsp substitutions which destabilise complexes with both proteinases. Although the e¡ect of the ¢rst mutation is similar for both proteinases, the second mutation is 14-fold more deleterious in the catg case. The isoleucine residue at position 6 is fully preserved in all 39 unique sequences of squash inhibitors [37] and we suppose that major dynamical changes occur in the binding loop upon substitutions either with Val or Asp that lead to a lowered binding energy with an enzyme. In agreement, Nielsen et al. observed a large increase in mobility of the binding loop and a huge decrease in the association constant for trypsin after installation of the IleCLeu mutation at P1 P in squash inhibitor [38]. The Ile6 CAsp substitution should, however, be considered jointly with the Pro4 CThr substitution, since in many di¡erent inhibitors side chains of Thr4 and Asp6 (or Glu6 ) form a hydrogen bond [39^41]. This bond is quite long in the free inhibitor, but becomes signi¢cantly shortened upon complex formation, thus stabilising the complex. Our modelling studies showed that in free CMTI I, forî mation of the 2.76 A hydrogen bond after introducing the mutations mentioned above is possible. We suppose that the respective 8.2- and 9.6-fold increase in association constant observed for catg and chtp is a consequence of P2 ^P1 P hydrogen bond shortening upon complex formation both with catg and chtp. An increase in the association constant was observed after introduction of the Ala18 CGly mutation at P12P position for both proteinases (Table 3). We believe that this mutation releases the strain at dihedral angles of Ala18 and perhaps leads to a slight improvement of the binding loop conformation, which is re£ected in the increase of the association constant for both proteinases.
