Abstract The expression of chemosensory proteins (CSPs) and odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) in individuals of different castes and ages have been monitored in three species of social hymenopterans, Polistes dominulus (Hymenoptera, Vespidae), Vespa crabro (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) and Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera, Apidae), using PCR with specific primers and polyclonal antibodies. In the paper wasp P. dominulus, OBP is equally expressed in antennae, wings and legs of all castes and ages, while CSP is often specifically present in antennae and in some cases also in legs. In the vespine species V. crabro CSP is antennal specific, while OBP is also expressed in legs and wings. The three CSPs and the five OBPs of A. mellifera show a complex pattern of expression, where both classes of proteins include members specifically expressed in antennae and others present in other parts of the body. These data indicate that at least in some hymenopteran species CSPs are specifically expressed in antennae and could perform roles in chemosensory perception so far assigned only to OBPs. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are two classes of small soluble proteins, that mediate, with mechanisms not completely clarified, chemical communication at the peripheral level (Vogt and Riddiford, 1981; Pelosi, 1998; Angeli et al., 1999; Sandler et al., 2000; Lartigue et al., 2002; Tegoni et al., 2004). These proteins are extremely concentrated in the lymph filling chemosensilla of antennae, tarsi and other

chemoreception structures (Steinbrecht, 1998; Shanbhag et al., 2001). CSPs are also expressed in other parts of the body, such as specialised glands or secretory cells, probably involved in some cases in the delivery of semiochemicals (Jacquin-Joly et al., 2001). Other functions for these proteins cannot be excluded and at least one member of the CSP family has been reported to be associated with regenerating limbs in the cockroach (Kitabayashi et al., 1998). A great number of OBPs and CSPs have been identified and characterised at the protein level in species belonging to several orders of insects (McKenna et al., 1994; Pikielny et al., 1994; Tuccini et al., 1996; Maleszka and Stange, 1997; Wojtasek et al., 1998, 1999; Picimbon and Leal, 1999; Vogt et al., 1999; Nagnan-Le Meillour et al., 2000; Marchese et al., 2000; Picimbon

et al., 2000, 2001; Jacquin-Joly et al., 2001; Ishida et al., 2002a; Riviere et al., 2003; Ban et al., 2003a, b). In addition, hundreds of sequences have been obtained from cDNA or directly from genomes (Hekmat-Scafe et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004a; Wanner et al., 2004). Therefore, the presence in the genome of sequences encoding members of the OBP and CSP classes (Hekmat-Scafe et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004a) is not enough to conclude that their expression products could be involved in chemical communication. The three-dimensional folding of four OBPs and one CSP have been resolved (Sandler et al., 2000; Horst et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Lartigue et al., 2002; Campanacci et al., 2003; Mosbah et al., 2003; Kruse et al., 2003; Lartigue et al., 2004). In social insects chemical communication is rather complex and can also mediate recognition between different castes or individuals of different nests. Such complexity is documented by a rich pheromonal language, making use of diverse chemical compounds, including long-chain hydrocarbons (Vander Meer et al., 1998). It is still unkown whether a similar complexity also exists at the level of proteins (soluble polypeptides, such as OBPs and CSPs and membrane-bound receptors) involved in chemoreception. The genomes of Apis mellifera and Bombyx mori have recently been completed, thus allowing interesting comparisons between social and non-social species. However, a study at the protein level is still necessary to complement the genomic information. So far, only few proteins of both classes have been reported in social insects. The most extensive study has been performed in the honeybee A. mellifera. Five genes encoding members of the OBP family (ASP1: Danty et al., 1999; ASP2: Briand et al., 2001; ASP4: AAL60417; ASP5: AAL60422; ASP6: AAL60421) and six encoding CSPs have been reported (ASP3c: Briand et al., 2002; W-AP1: Kamikouchi et al., 2004; BB17: BI510373; AmelCG4, AmelCG5, AmelCG6: Wanner et al., 2004). In the paper wasp Polistes dominulus we have identified one OBP and one CSP, but failed to detect sequences orthologous to those of the honeybee (Calvello et al., 2003). Several OBPs have also been reported in some ant species of the genus Solenopsis (Krieger and Ross, 2002) and a CSP in the argentine ant Linepithema humile (Ishida et al., 2002b). Interestingly, this last protein, as the CSP of P. dominulus, was found to be specific of antennae, whereas all previous studies in other insect species had shown that OBPs were antennal specific, while CSPs had been detected in different organs. Despite such wide information at the structural level, functional data are still scarce and not conclusive. Ligand-binding experiments so far have failed in

detecting clear-cut specificity of OBPs or CSPs towards semiochemicals of the species being examined, although better affinities have been reported in some cases with chemicals that are or could be active in chemical communication (Briand et al., 2002; Riviere et al., 2003; Calvello et al., 2003). Altered behaviour in insects lacking a specific OBP have been observed in two cases. In the first report, Drosophila mutants in which the gene expressing LUSH, a member of the OBP family, was deleted exhibited an altered behaviour towards ethanol (Kim et al., 1998). However, an alternative interpretation of such results has been proposed (Zhou et al., 2004b). The second case regards colonies of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta), where the lack of an OBP is apparently related with anomalous production of several queens in the colony (Krieger and Ross, 2002). For this OBP, that is synthesised in the thorax, a function in the correct release rather than in the perception of chemical signals seems more likely. The distribution of OBPs and CSPs in different chemosensory structures and other parts of the body, as well as their expression during the insect's life cycle and, as far as social insects are concerned, in different castes and ranks, could provide useful information to the understanding of the physiological role of these soluble proteins in chemical communication. Here we report the identification and cloning of a CSP in the wasp Vespa crabro and monitor the expression of both proteins in different organs and different castes of this species and of the paper wasp P. dominulus, using Western blot experiments. We also performed a similar investigation in the honeybee A. mellifera, using the five OBPs and the three CSPs described in the literature. In Polistes wasps female castes are usually divided according to the appearance of the individuals in the various parts of the colony cycle. Workers are typically the first females which emerge from the newly founded nests and work on the colony without reproducing; foundresses are those females which emerge in an advanced colony phase, mate and hibernate and found a new nest the following year. No sharp differences exist in morphology between the two castes so that it is still unsure if a true pre-imaginal caste differentiation occurs in these insects. This is certain, on the other hand, in V. crabro and A. mellifera where the caste of an individual is determined at the larval level.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Insects Individuals of P. dominulus, V. crabro and A. mellifera were selected according to caste and age. We collected and analysed ``hibernating'' females and active foundresses, later differentiated into active dominant and

subordinate foundresses, as well as workers and males of P. dominulus; queens, males and workers of V. crabro; newly emerged workers, foragers, virgin queens, mated queens and drones of A. mellifera. All the specimens of P. dominulus and V. crabro came from different wild colonies. For A. mellifera, drones, workers and virgin queens were collected from the same colonies, while mated queens came from different hives. 2.2. Preparation of extracts Crude extracts of antennae and other parts of the body (deantennated head, legs, wings, thorax and abdomen) were prepared by homogenisation in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4 (Tris buffer), containing 1 mM PMSF and directly analysed by electrophoresis or used in Western blot experiments. For each sample, parts of body were pooled from 5 to 10 individuals and aliquots were analysed by electrophoresis, as reported in the figures legends. 2.3. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis Total RNA was extracted with the TrizolTM reagent kit (GIBCO BRL), along with the manufacturer's protocol and employed to prepare cDNA using the Invitrogen ThermoScriptTM RT-PCR System, 4­6 individuals were used for each extract. 2.4. Polymerase chain reaction Aliquots of 1 ml of crude cDNA were amplified in a Bio-Rad Gene CyclerTM thermocycler, using 2.5 units of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Sigma), 1 mM of each dNTP (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), 1 mM of each PCR primer, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mg/ml BSA in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After a denaturating step at 95 1C for 5 min, 35 cycles were performed (1 min at 951, 1 min at 501, 1 min at 72 1C), followed by 7 min at 72 1C. All PCR experiments were done in the same conditions. To amplify putative sequences encoding CSPs in V. crabro, we used a 1:1 mixture of the following primers designed on the N-terminal and Cterminal amino acid sequence of ASP3c of A. mellifera: forward: 50 -AAATTTGACAATATIAATGTGGA-3 0 0 +5 -AAGTTCGATAACAAIAACGTIGA-30 ; reverse: 50 -GTACTTTTTGTCTGGGTCGTATTT-30 +50 -ATA TTTCTTATCIGGATCATACTT-30 . 2.5. Cloning and sequencing The crude PCR product (about 250 bp) was ligated into a pGEM vector without further purification, using a 1:5 (plasmid: insert) molar ratio and by incubating the mixture overnight at 4 1C. After transformation of

Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue competent cells with the ligation product, positive colonies were selected by PCR, using the plasmid's primers SP6 and T7 and grown in LB/ampicillin medium. DNA was extracted and custom sequenced at MWG, Germany. Complete cDNA sequences of the clones of interest were then obtained using at the 30 end an oligo-dT20VNN and adopting a RACE approach at the 50 end, employing the Invitrogen Kit and the specific forward primers in a nested PCR: 50 -GGCAAGAAGTTTCTCCCAGAT-30 (first primer) and 50 -ATCCTTCTTATTATGAGACAA-30 (second primer). 2.6. Preparation of antisera Antisera were obtained by injecting an adult rabbit subcutaneously with 300 mg of recombinant OBP or CSP of P. dominulus (Calvello et al., 2003), followed by two additional injections of 200 mg after 15 and 30 days. The protein was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant for the first injection and incomplete adjuvant for further injections. Animals were bled 15 days after the last injection and the serum was used without further purification. Rabbits were individually housed in large cages, at constant temperature, and all operations were performed according to ethical guidelines in order to minimise pain and discomfort to animals. 2.7. Western-blot analysis After electrophoretic separation under denaturing conditions (14% SDS-PAGE), duplicate gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie blue G250 in 10% acetic acid, 25% ethanol or electroblotted on Trans-Blot nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Lab) by the procedure of Kyhse-Andersen (1984). After treatment with 2% powdered skimmed milk/0.05% Tween 20 in PBS overnight, the membrane was incubated with the crude antiserum against the protein at a dilution of 1:200 (1 h) and then with goat anti-(rabbit IgG) horseradish peroxidase conjugate (dilution 1:1000; 1 h). Immunoreacting bands were detected by treatment with 4-chloro1-naphthol.

3. Results 3.1. Expression of OBP and CSP in P. dominulus Previous investigation, using MALDI-TOF to analyse low molecular weight proteins in males and workers of the paper wasp, had indicated the specific expression of CSP in the antennae and the wider presence of OBP in antennae, wings and legs (Calvello et al., 2003). To further investigate this aspect, we have used antisera

against recombinant P. dominulus OBP and CSP in Western blot experiments to monitor the expression of the two proteins in different parts of the body of individuals of different ranks and ages. Mated females of P. dominulus overwinter to become potential foundresses of new colonies. For each nest, in the spring, one of these becomes queen, while the others remain as subordinates. Individuals representative of both these ranks were subjected to analysis together with males and workers. The results are reported in Fig. 1. It is clear that OBP is expressed at comparable levels in antennae, wings and legs in individuals of all ranks, while CSP shows a more selective pattern. In males and workers CSP is mainly present only in antennae, while in females of other ranks it is also produced in legs. We can also observe that the intensity of the immunostained CSP in legs, barely visible in the workers sample, becomes medium to strong in the other ranks. In other parts of the body (deantennated head, thorax and abdomen of workers) OBP is only expressed in the head (probably in other chemosensory structures), while CSP is not present in any of the three samples (Fig. 2). Therefore, CSP is rather antennal-specific, while OBP, although being expressed in other organs is not ubiquitous and its presence is not associated to the cuticle, as it is the case of CSP-I in Schistocerca gregaria.

3.2. Expression of OBP and CSP in V. crabro The ``reversed'' expression of OBP and CSP in P. dominulus prompted us to perform a similar study in the highly social species V. crabro. Electrophoretic analysis of crude antennal, wings and legs extracts in denaturing conditions revealed the presence of low molecular weight bands in all three organs. The same

sample, however, when analysed in native conditions revealed fast migrating bands only in the antennal sample, that were stained in Western blot experiments by the antiserum against the CSP of P. dominulus (Fig. 3). Despite the protein similarity indicated by such good cross-reactivity, we were unable to amplify any gene encoding CSP in V. crabro, using degenerate primers, designed on the sequence of P. dominulus CSP. Instead, primers designed at both ends of the A. mellifera CSP (ASP3c) afforded a PCR band of the expected size, that proved to encode a protein of the CSP family. Using an oligo-dT at the 30 end and a RACE approach at 50 end we obtained the full-length gene, whose expression product is aligned in Fig. 4 with ASP3c. This protein surprisingly showed the highest percent of identical amino acids (60%) with the CSP of V. crabro, despite the greater phylogenetical distance between the two species, as compared to that between V. crabro and P. dominulus. The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding V. crabro CSP is available in the GenBank under the acc. no. AY803290.

Given the good cross reactivity of putative OBP and CSP with the antisera against the corresponding proteins of P. dominulus, we have monitored their expression in antennae, wings and legs of V. crabro individuals belonging to different castes. In this species the social organisation is more complex than in P. dominulus and more similar to the honeybee, with three castes, workers, males and queens. The results of Western blot experiments, performed on crude extracts after separation on SDS-PAGE, are shown in Fig. 5. In all three castes OBP is equally expressed in antennae, wings and legs, while CSP is always antennal specific. 3.3. Expression of OBPS and CSPS in A. mellifera The results so far reported show that in two species of wasps, P. dominulus and V. crabro, CSP is generally antennal specific, while OBP is more widely espressed, unlike what it is generally reported in other orders of insects, where OBPs are the antennal specific proteins. This ``reversed'' expression pattern, that was reported for the first time in the Argentine ant L. humile, suggested that it could be a feature of all Hymenoptera. Therefore, we decided to include in our study the honeybee and monitor the expression of some OBPs and CSPs in antennae, wings and legs of two different ages of workers and queens, as well as drones. This study was

performed through the use of PCR with specific primers matching the first and last 20 bases of the coding regions. Five OBPs and six CSPs have been described in the literature for the honeybee A. mellifera. In our study we have included all the OBPs and three CSPs. The results, showing the actual electrophoretic gels of crude PCR products are reported in Figs. 6

and 7. Generally, the use of specific primers at both ends of the encoding sequence provided bands of the expected size or no amplification product. However, in some case bands of larger size were produced, sometimes together with the expected ones. In Fig. 7, reporting the experiments related to CSPs, such bands are present in some of the samples when amplified with primers for W-AP1 and, to a larger extent, with primers

for BB17. The size of these additional bands (400 and 600 bp, respectively) are in good agreement with the expected sizes of the relative genomic sequences (402 and 590 bp). Concerning the results relative to OBPs (Fig. 6), main additional bands of about 600, 800, and 650 bp were obtained for ASP1, ASP4 and ASP5, respectively. ASP6 shows a more complex pattern of bands up to 800 bp. Some of these values are in agreement with the expected length of the genes, when including all the introns (790, 843, 620 and 881 bp for ASP1, ASP4, ASP5 and ASP6, respectively). Other bands could be generated from partially processed mRNA. For a better comparison of the PCR data with the expected length of the sequences, the structures of the genes encoding CSPs and OBPs are reported in Fig. 8. Concerning the expression of CSPs and OBPs in different parts of the body and in the castes of the honeybee, a complex pattern is evident, that does not indicate any of the two classes of proteins being antennal specific. One CSP (ASP3c) and one OBP (ASP4) appear to be equally expressed in all the three parts of the body and all the three castes and two ages examined. On the other hand, other OBPs seem to be

Arrows indicate positions of forward and reverse primers used for the PCR amplifications reported in Figs. 6 and 7. The expected sizes of amplification products (bp) including and excluding introns are as follows: ASP1: 790, 357; ASP2: 813, 369; ASP4: 843, 369; ASP5: 620, 354; ASP6: 881, 354; ASP3c: 780, 327; W-AP1: 402, 291; BB17: 590, 252.

antennal specific, as in the case of ASP2 and to some extent ASP1. It is also interesting to observe that other proteins, both OBPs and CSPs show complex patterns

of expression, according to caste, but also to age. For instance, the CSP BB17 is well expressed in all three organs of the newly emerged workers, queens and males, but its synthesis decreases or disappears with age. A more detailed study, also based on immunodetection of the relative proteins, is necessary before further discussing such complex expression pattern. However, the antennal specificity of CSPs observed in the Argentine ant and the two wasp species cannot be generalised for all Hymenoptera. Moreover, the complex expression patterns of CSPs and OBPs observed in the honeybee, as well as the ``anomalous'' distribution of these proteins in other Hymenoptera, support the hypothesis that OBPs and CSPs are two classes of soluble proteins performing similar functions in chemical communication in insects.

4. Discussion The demonstration that olfactory receptors can respond to odorants and pheromones when expressed in foreign species (Wetzel et al., 2001; Dobritsa et al., 2003; Hallem et al., 2004) seems to leave no space for a role of soluble binding proteins (OBPs and CSPs) in insect chemoreception. However, olfactory receptors, when expressed in heterologous systems, exhibit kinetics both in the response and in the recovery phases, different from those measured in their natural environment. Therefore, soluble proteins, such as OBPs, CSPs and odorant degrading enzymes (ODEs) seem to play their function in olfactory perception. On the other hand, the importance of OBPs and CSPs is also suggested by their exceptional concentration in the sensillum lymph (in the order of 10 mM, according to Vogt et al., 1989), that requires very high energetic costs by the insect and by their wide variety expressed in most insect species. In fact, the problem of the physiological function of OBPs in insects as well as in vertebrates remains the main open question in the field of olfaction. This paper addresses such problem focusing on the expression of OBPs and CSPs in different parts of the body, in relation to age, caste and rank. We have observed that both classes of soluble proteins show complex patterns of expression, further supporting the idea that their presence in specific organs is important for some yet undefined function, probably linked to caste and age and under physiological control. Using Western blot immunostaining (Fig. 1) we have confirmed our previous observation (based on MALDIMS) that CSP is antennal specific in workers and males of P. dominulus, while OBP is equally expressed in antennae, wings and legs (Calvello et al., 2003). In fact, no cross reactivity with the antiserum was detected in wings of both sexes and only a faint band can be seen in the sample of workers' legs. In mated females of different

age and rank, instead, the expression of CSP in legs becomes clear, suggesting that the synthesis of this protein in legs is under some control. On the other hand, OBP, that had been regarded as the ``important'' protein in other species, because of its specific expression in antennae, is equally present in antennae, wings and legs of the paper wasp, but not in other parts of the body (Fig. 2). The fact that CSP is only weakly expressed in the legs of workers, but heavily present in those of subordinated foundresses (which are mated females but behave like workers), could be due to different ages of the two groups of individuals, but could be also related to differences occurred at the pre-imaginal level. However such a question, obviously connected with the castal differentiation of these primitively social wasps where all the females are similar in size and morphology (Hunt, 1991; O'Donnell, 1998), remains open, as the data here provided cannot clearly support either of the two hypotheses (pre- or post imaginal differentiation). Such ``reversed'' distribution of OBPs and CSPs had been previously reported in the argentine ant L. humile (Ishida et al., 2002b) and is also very clearly found in another wasp, V. crabro, a species where three well defined morphological castes exist, males, workers and queens (Fig. 3). In this species, however, such data are limited to the OBPs and CSPs cross reacting with the antisera produced against the protein of P. dominulus. We cannot exclude the presence of other members of both classes of proteins, that may show different patterns of expression. In this respect, we can reasonably speculate that the CSP we have cloned in V. crabro is probably different from the protein recognised by the antiserum against P. dominulus CSP. In fact, it is very similar (60% of identical amino acids) with ASP3c of A. mellifera, but rather distant from the CSP of P. dominulus (35% of identical amino acids). This cautious consideration is suggested by the complex expression pattern observed in the honeybee. In this case, we have monitored three CSPs and five OBPs and found specificity as well as generalised expression in both groups of proteins. In fact, while the CSP ASP3c and the OBP ASP4 are equally expresses in the three organs of castes and age groups, ASP2, another OBP, is only and always detectable in antennae, and other proteins show patterns of expression in different parts of the body variable with caste and age. These results are in some agreement with observations previously reported in the literature. In fact, ASP2, that, according to our PCR data, appears to be the only strictly antennal specific OBP in all castes and ages, was also reported to be exclusively expressed in the antennae of workers and drones (Danty et al., 1997). In the same paper ASP6 was detected in antennae and legs of both workers and drones, a result confirmed by our experiments. ASP1, instead, that was also reported as antennal specific in workers and drones (Danty et al., 1998) showed up in our PCR experiments

also in the legs of drones. We also detected W-AP1, a member of the CSP family, in antennae and legs of workers and drones, while in a previous report (Danty et al., 1998) the protein was identified in antennae and legs of workers, but only in the antennae of drones. A more recent paper (Kamikouchi et al., 2004) reports the presence of high levels of mRNA encoding this protein in the antennae of workers, but also traces in the legs. As the conditions used for our PCR experiments do not allow a quantitative evaluation of the mRNA present (although we included the positive control of actin), our specific amplification bands may have arisen from genes expressed at very low levels, below the identification threshold for the protein. The high similarity between the CSP of V. crabro and that (ASP3c) of A. mellifera is unexpected, given the phylogenetic distance between the two species. However it may be interesting to observe that epicuticular lipids, which in social insects are considered semiochemicals of crucial importance for several aspects of social organisation, are qualitatively similar in honeybees (Francis et al., 1985) and hornets (Butts et al., 1991). In these two species cuticular lipids are characterised by the predominance of linear alkenes and alkanes with chain lengths ranging from 19 to 35 carbon atoms in the honeybees (Francis et al., 1985) and from 21 to 32 in the hornets (Ruther et al., 1998; Dani et al., 2003). Moreover both these species present primary fatty alcohols as minor constituents of the epicuticular lipids (Dani et al., 2003; Dani et al., 2005). On the contrary P. dominulus epicuticular lipids are characterised by a net predominance of mono- and di-methyl branched alkanes (Bonavita-Cougourdan et al., 1991). The correlation between the similarity in the epicuticle lipid composition of A. mellifera and V. crabro and their CSPs suggests that these proteins may indeed be involved in reception of such semiochemicals. The results obtained further support an active role of CSPs in chemical communication and clearly indicate these polypeptides as a second class of OBPs. In fact, both OBPs and CSPs are secreted in the lymph of chemosensilla, bind small ligands, sometimes with associated conformational changes, and are differentially expressed in different parts of the body, according to species, sex, caste and age.
