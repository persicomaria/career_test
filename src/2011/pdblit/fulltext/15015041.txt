Structural study of copper(I)-bleomycin

Received: 4 November 2003 / Accepted: 12 February 2004 / Published online: 10 March 2004 Ó SBIC 2004

Abstract Previous NMR studies on Cu(I)-bleomycin have suggested that this adduct has a geometry distinct from Fe(II)BLM. The coordination chemistry of this bleomycin derivative has been investigated through the extension of the NMR data reported previously, and the use of molecular dynamics calculations. The data collected from the NMR experiments support the coordination to the metal center of the primary and secondary amines in b-aminoalanine and the pyrimidine ring. The detection in the NMR spectra of the signal derived from the amide hydrogen in b-hydroxyhistidine indicates that this amide is protonated in Cu(I)-bleomycin, precluding participation of the pyrimidinyl carboxamide nitrogen in the coordination of Cu(I), as previously reported. Threedimensional solution structures compatible with the NMR data have been assayed for Cu(I)-bleomycin for the first time by way of molecular dynamics calculations, and two models showing four and five coordination have been found to be those that better fit the experimental data. In both models the primary amine in baminoalanine is coordinated such that it is located on the same side, with respect to the coordination cage, as the peptide linker fragment. This result seems important for the favored models to be compatible with either their possible oxidation to become one of the reported structures for Cu(II)BLM, or their transformation into Fe(II) adducts able to cause DNA damage.

Introduction
Bleomycins (BLMs) (Fig. 1) are antitumor agents which are isolated from Streptomyces verticillus [1]. Clinically, BLMs are employed for the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas [2], non-Hodgkin's lymphomas [3], testicular carcinomas [4], and ovarian cancer [5]. The drug acts as an antitumor agent by virtue of the ability of a metal complex of the antibiotic to cleave DNA [6]. Although elaborated by S. verticillus as a copper chelate [1], it is an iron chelate of BLM that has been reported to coordinate and reduce oxygen, thus producing the ``active complex'' of BLM [7]. Some studies indicated that Cu inhibits the action of BLM [8]. However, later evidence demonstrated that Cu(I)BLM could be aerobically oxidized to generate oxygen radicals, indicating that Cu(II)+BLM in the presence of dithiothreitol was capable of cleaving DNA [9, 10, 11].

As a result of their studies on CuBLM, some workers in the field support the hypothesis that this adduct is a prodrug, delivering BLM to the cell nucleus where it becomes a spectator, and Fe(II) is responsible for oxidative DNA damage [12, 13]. However, conditions have been delineated that demonstrate the activity of Cu(I)BLM when reductively activated. Additionally, Ehrenfeld et al. [14] have also shown that the presence of both Cu and Fe could increase DNA cleavage beyond that exhibited by either metal ion alone. This fact suggests that even if Cu is not involved directly in producing DNA damage in vivo, this metal could participate in generating an active FeBLM under cellular conditions. The aforementioned circumstances evince that the role of Cu- versus FeBLMs as mediators of in vivo DNA damage remains unanswered. Among other experimental evidence, the higher affinity of Cu for BLM has prompted Hecht, Oppenheimer and their co-workers to suggest the possibility that Cu rather than Fe may be the biologically relevant metal [9, 11]. In their studies of Cu(I)BLM, these workers have found that DNA degradation by Cu(I)BLM was independent of contaminating Fe(II) [11]. Additionally, the NMR data derived for Cu(I)BLM in this study indicated that this BLM adduct has a geometry distinct from Fe(II)BLM and deglycoFe(II)BLM, both of which have also been shown to effect DNA strand scission [7, 15]. If, as pointed out by these workers, Cu(I)BLM is oxidation­reduction active, its geometry is of importance in defining the structural requirements for BLM activity. In the present report, NMR studies are presented on Cu(I)BLM that support and extend those already published [9, 11]. The NOESY data derived for Cu(I)BLM allowed molecular dynamics (MD) calculations to be

performed for this BLM adduct. Three-dimensional structures for Cu(I)BLM, compatible with the generated NMR data, are proposed and discussed considering either their possible oxidation to become one of the reported structures for Cu(II)BLM, or their transformation into an Fe(II) adduct able to cause DNA damage.

Materials and methods
Sample preparation Blenoxane (BNX), the commercial mixture of BLM congeners, was a generous gift of Dr. Lourdes Santos, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Caracas, Venezuela). The various BLMs differ only with respect to the structure of the C-terminal amine (Fig. 1). The commercial drug consists predominantly of a 3:1 mixture of BLM-A2 and BLM-B2, with trace quantities of other congeners. Most of the proton resonances are identical for BLM-A2 and BLM-B2, and evidence from chemical shift studies suggests similar solution conformational characteristics for these two congeners [16]. For these reasons, the commercial mixture was used in the experiments without further purification, and is referred to as BLM. Additionally, we were particularly interested in the properties of the clinically employed mixture. BLM (2.5 lmol), lyophilized three times from D2O, was dissolved in 0.5 mL of D2O (99.9% D; Aldrich). A solution of Cu(II)SO4.5H2O in D2O was added to afford a BLM:Cu(II) ratio of 1:1. The pH (meter reading uncorrected for the deuterium isotope effect) was adjusted to 8.1 with a 1 M NaOD solution. The Cu(II)BLM sample prepared was transferred to a purged NMR tube. Cu(I) was generated in situ from Cu(II) by addition of 20 lL of 4 M sodium dithionite in D2O under anaerobic conditions. Visually, the blue Cu(II)BLM solution turned pale yellow upon addition of dithionite. The NMR tube containing the Cu(I)BLM sample was immediately sealed. In the absence of oxygen, the pale yellow solution was stable. A 1:1 Cu(I)BLM sample in H2O was prepared by an analogous procedure. 5 mM apo-BLM samples at pH 8.1 were also prepared in D2O and H2O.

325 NMR spectra NMR experiments were performed at 500 MHz on a Bruker DRX500 NMR spectrometer and referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) at 0.00 ppm. Processing and analysis of the NMR data were performed on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation, using NMRPipe [17] and NMRView [18] software. For the two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) [19, 20] and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) [21] experiments, solvent suppression was achieved using the WATERGATE sequence [22] incorporated into these two-dimensional experiments. Spectra were recorded at 278 K, using time-proportional phase incrementation (TPPI) [23] for quadrature detection in x1. The mixing times in NOESY and TOCSY experiments were typically 200 ms and 40 ms, respectively. Spectral widths were typically 12 ppm in both dimensions, and 512 t1 points were acquired with 2048 complex points for each free induction decay (FID). The number of scans for a t1 point was usually 32. Spectra were Fourier transformed using Lorentzian-toGaussian weighting and phase-shifted sine-bell window functions. 1 H-detected heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) [24] (JC-H set at 145 Hz) and 1H-detected heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) [25] (s=65 ms) experiments on Cu(I)BLM in D2O were recorded at 27 °C. For the HMQC and HMBC experiments, data sets with 2048·256 complex points were acquired with 6000 Hz sweep width in the proton dimension and 100,000 Hz in the carbon dimension. A total of 128 scans were collected per t1 point. HMQC and HMBC spectra were processed with exponential weighting functions. Spin-echo correlated spectroscopy (SECSY) [26, 27] experiments were performed at 298 K in D2O. Prior to the standard SECSY pulse sequence, during the relaxation delay period (2.5 s) the HDO resonance was selectively irradiated (64 dB). Quadrature detection was used in both directions. For each value of t1, 32 FIDs (2000 data points, acquisition time 0.3146 s) were acquired. The value of t1 was varied between 3 ls and 40.96 ms in steps of 77 ls. Prior to Fourier transformation, the FIDs were multiplied with a sine-bell window function in both directions. Spectra were calculated in absolute value mode. Correlated spectroscopy (COSY) [28] spectra were recorded in D2O at 298 K with a data matrix of 2048·512 (t1) complex pairs. Prior to the standard COSY pulse sequence, during the relaxation delay period (2.5 s) the HDO resonance was selectively irradiated (64 dB). The spectral width was 6000 Hz in both dimensions. FIDs were multiplied with a sine-bell window function in both directions. Spectra were calculated in absolute value mode. of the following steps. (1) Heat and equilibrate the system from 5 to 1000 K over 10 ps in 10 K increments, with velocities assigned every 0.001 ps. No distance constraints were used in this first step in order to randomize the structure before the application of the constraints. (2) MD run for 4 ps with distance constraints ap° plied with a force constant of 0.06 kcal mol)1 A)2. (3) Scaling of ° the force constants to 120 kcal mol)1 A)2 through 7.6 ps, in a series of 0.4 ps MD runs. (4) High-temperature equilibration for 6 ps. (5) Slow cooling down to 300 K over a period of 7 ps. At 300 K the force constants of the distance constraints were re° duced to the final value of 60 kcal mol)1 A)2. (6) Final MD run for 15 ps. The final structure for each iteration was generated by mass-weighted r.m.s. fitting and averaging the coordinates from the last 5 ps of the trajectory (10 structures), followed by energy minimization with the distance restraints. The overall final structure for each model was obtained from the minimized average of the five average structures. All energy minimizations used the extensible systematic force field (ESFF). Distance constraints were applied using a flat-bottomed potential. The ESFF is a new rule-based force field suitable for organometallic and inorganic systems. ESFF can be used to model proteins containing transition metals. With ESFF, force field parameters for bonds, angles, and torsion are calculated by Discover_3 and saved to a file [31]. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data were collected and used in the simulations. Sizes of the NOEs were classified as strong, medium, or weak, based on visual inspection of the NOESY spectra collected at 200 ms mixing time in D2O and H2O. NOEderived distance constraints were set at 1.8­3.0, 1.8­4.0, and 1.8­ ° 5.0 A for strong, medium, and weak NOEs, respectively. An ° additional 1.0 A was allowed for NOEs involving methyl groups and ambiguous methylene protons. A total of 40 non-trivial constraints were applied using a flat-bottomed potential. Three models (structures I­III, Fig. 4) were used as starting structures for the MD simulated annealing calculations. These structures were constructed based on the coordinates from some of the Co(II)BLM and Fe(II)BLM models used by us in previous work [32, 33].

Results and discussion
NMR results The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of Cu(I)BLM is shown in Fig. 2. Most of the observed features have been assigned through two-dimensional experiments (SECSY, COSY, TOCSY, and HMQC) to establish scalar connectivities. The strategy used for proton assignment in Cu(I)BLM is similar to that previously reported by Haasnoot et al. [34] and Akkerman et al. [35, 36] for free BLM, ZnBLM, and CO-Fe(II)BLM, respectively. The pH value used in the present study is higher than that reported by Hecht and co-workers [11]. Although the NH groups could exhibit faster exchange rates at pH 8.1, making the assignments of these protons more difficult, it is interesting to notice that, in general, there are not drastic changes in the NMR spectra taken at pH 7.1 [11] and the 8.1 value used by us. This result can be interpreted to say that the solution structure of the Cu(I)BLM complex at pH 7.1 is stable enough, and remains the same at pH 8.1. The a-NH proton of the bhydroxyhistidine moiety is still observed at this pH value (Fig. 2), indicating that the a-NH nitrogen remains uncoordinated.

Molecular modeling of Cu(I)BLM All calculations were carried out with InsightII/Discover_3 (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif., USA) on a Silicon Graphics Octane ° workstation. Aqueous simulations were carried out using a 10 A solvent shell. The non-bonded van der Waals interaction was cut ° off at 25 A for the solvent system. The distance-dependent dielectric constant algorithm was used. MD calculations used the Verlet velocity algorithm with a 0.01 ps time step, and scaling every 10 steps. The calculation protocol used to model Cu(I)BLM is similar to that employed with HOO-Co(III)BLM [29] and Ga(III)BLM ° [30]. A 10 A solvent shell was created around the BLM complex. The water molecules were minimized with the group-based cutoff, while holding the BLM complex fixed. Then the water molecules were fixed, and the BLM complex was minimized with no constraints using the cell multipole method. The BLM structures were first energy minimized without constraints by the steepest descent method, followed by conjugate gradient minimization to an r.m.s. gradient of <0.1. The distance constraints were then applied at ° 60 kcal mol)1 A)1, and the minimization steps were repeated. These structures were used in the MD simulated annealing. For each one of the models assayed, five calculations were run with different starting velocities. Each calculation consisted

326

protons (P=pyrimidinylpropionamide), based on the connectivities of one of them (P-CONH) with the PCaH2 group. Another pair of coupled signals is detected at 7.91/7.18 ppm. Although the signal at 7.91 ppm almost overlaps with that coming from the His-C2H nucleus (7.85 ppm), their NOE connectivities can be differentiated through the comparison of the spectra taken in H2O and D2O. This comparison indicates that the peak at 7.91 ppm exhibits a weak NOE with the CaH proton of the b-aminoalanine (A) moiety. Therefore, the 7.91/7.18 ppm pair is attributed to the A-CONH2 group. The last pair of coupled protons gives rise to a pair of signals located at 6.81 and 6.38 ppm. Having assigned all the other pairs of exchangeable protons, this last couple of signals are identified as that generated by the A-NH2 protons. Unfortunately, confirmation of this assignment cannot be achieved through their possible NOE connectivities to other protons in the A segment. However, the assignment of the signal at 6.77 ppm to the P-NH2 protons, through its NOE connection to the P-CH3 group, leaves the assignment of the 6.81/6.38 ppm pair to the ANH2 protons as the only option. The detection of the signal derived from the P-NH2 protons as a singlet connected via an NOE cross peak to the resonance of the ring methyl group of the pyrimidinyl unit is also reported for apo-BLM by Haasnoot et al. [34]. V and T protons

We have used the assignments made by Hecht's group [11] for Cu(I)BLM as a starting point. Some of the signals identified in the present investigation confirm those previously accounted for, with differences in chemical shifts probably caused by pH and temperature differences between the respective samples. Therefore, only the 1H NMR signals not reported by Hecht's group will be discussed in detail. The 1H chemical shifts of Cu(I)BLM are presented in Table S1, provided as Supplementary material, together with those of free BLM at pH 8.1 and 5 °C. Exchangeable NH2 protons The 6.0­9.5 ppm region of the 200 ms NOESY spectrum of Cu(I)BLM at 278 K is shown in Fig. 3. In this spectrum, four pairs of exchangeable protons coupled to each other are observed. The set of exchangeable protons at 6.39/6.09 ppm (also observed in TOCSY) are assigned to the M-OCONH2 group (M=mannose), based on the identification of these protons performed by Hecht and co-workers [11] detected as a broad signal at $6.3 ppm. The connected signals located at 7.79/7.00 ppm can be easily identified as those generated by the P-CONH2

The assignments of the CaH, CbH, and CcH protons in the methylvalerate (V) segment, and the CaH proton in threonine (T) previously reported [11], allowed the identification of the NH signals of these BLM segments as those located at 8.23 and 8.06 ppm, respectively. These assignments were achieved through the NOE connectivities of the previously identified peaks of these moieties with their NH protons. Additionally, the 1H signals of the CbH and CbCH3 groups in the T moiety were located at 4.00 and 1.03 ppm, respectively, based on their NOE and TOCSY correlations with the aforementioned NH protons. B and S protons Hecht and co-workers did not report assignments for the bithiazole (B) protons and those located in the tail of BLM, but their signals were identified in the present investigation. As observed by Chen et al. [16] for free BNX, the difference between the 1H NMR spectra of BLM-A2 and BLM-B2 are limited to resonances originating from the chemically distinct basic groups at the C-terminus of the peptide chain, and from the adjacent bithiazole-containing residue. Our spectra indicate that for BLM-A2 the B-C5H and B-C5H¢ protons are located at 8.11 and 7.88 ppm, respectively, whereas for BLM-B2 these protons exhibit signals at 8.05 and 7.88 ppm, respectively. These two sets of resonances were identified

in the spectra taken in D2O, and can be differentiated from each other based on the intensity ratio of BLMA2:BLM-B2 peaks of about 3:1, as expected from the portions of these congeners in Blenoxane. Our assignments for the -NH(CH2)3S+(CH3)2 and NH(CH2)4NHC(NH)(NH2) methylene and NH protons in Cu(I)BLM-A2 and -B2, respectively, are consistent with those reported by Chen et al. [16] for apo-BNX. In Cu(I)BLM-A2 a two-proton resonance centered at 2.15 ppm in coupled to two other methylene groups, one centered at 3.42 ppm and the other at 3.59 ppm. The latter methylene peak couples to an NH signal at d$9.08 ppm, and must therefore originate from the CaH2 protons in the positively charged tail of BLM-A2. The 2.15 and 3.42 ppm features are assigned to the CbH2 and CcH2 protons of this residue, respectively. In BLM-B2, a four-proton signal is observed at 1.59 ppm, which is assigned to the overlapping resonances of the CbH2 and CcH2 groups of the B2 tail. This resonance is coupled to two signals at d$3.13 and 3.36 ppm, with the latter coupled to an NH feature at 8.79 ppm. The signals at 3.13 and 3.36 ppm are therefore assigned to the CdH2 and CaH2 protons in the B2 tail, respectively. The TOCSY spectrum of Cu(I)BLM taken in H2O shows correlations between the signals assigned to the (CbH2+CcH2) and CdH2 protons and a peak at d$6.98 ppm. These correlations indicate that the feature at 6.98 ppm originates from the unique guanidine NHC(=NH2+)-NH2 hydrogen of the B2 terminal segment. The remaining protons in the NH-C(=NH2+)-NH2 segment could not be identified in the present work, possibly due to their overlap with the M-NH2 protons. The -NH-CaH2-CbH2- protons of the B moiety remain to be assigned. A set of NOE and TOCSY

connected signals located at 8.35, 3.17, and 3.54 ppm is assigned to the NH, CbH2, and CaH2 protons of this segment, respectively, based on their identification in apo-BLM [34]. H protons In their NMR studies of Cu(I)BLM, Hecht and coworkers [11] found a broad peak at $9.30 ppm which was attributed to the a-NH proton of b-hydroxyhistidine (H). In the present investigation, a broad feature at 9.41 ppm, which is NOE and TOCSY correlated to the resonances assigned to CaH (4.95 ppm) and CbH (5.22 ppm) of this moiety, was detected, and therefore assigned to the amide nitrogen of the H segment. This fact indicates that the b-hydroxyhistidine amide is protonated in Cu(I)BLM. In previously studied metallo-BLMs [29, 30, 36, 37, 38], no resonance was detected for this proton, and this result was used to support the coordination of the H amide nitrogen to their metal centers. The presence of the H-aNH proton in Cu(I)BLM precludes participation of the pyrimidinyl carboxamide nitrogen in the coordination of Cu(I) to BLM, and it is the main finding used by Hecht's group [11] to conclude that Cu(I)BLM has a geometry distinct from other metal BLMs. Sugar protons Based on the assignments of the sugar protons performed for other metallo-BLMs [29, 30, 36, 37, 38], and having identified the features at 4.95 and 5.22 ppm as those arising from H-CaH and H-CbH, there are only two

328

candidates left for the resonances at 4.96 and 5.20 ppm, namely the anomeric C1H protons of the mannose and gulose moieties. 1H­13C correlations of the aforementioned 1H signals with their 13C partners located in the 80­ 100 ppm region of the 13C spectrum, and well separated from the rest of the sugar carbon resonances, were found in the HMQC spectra acquired for Cu(I)BLM (data not shown). The resonances at 4.96 and 5.20 ppm were assigned to M-C1H and G-C1H (G=gulose), respectively, based on the identification of these protons in the 1H NMR spectra of Cu(I)BLM previously reported [11]. Further evidence for such an assignment is provided by the cross peaks connecting H-CbH and G-C1H, and HCbH and G-C1H, observed in the HMBC spectra of Cu(I)BLM. The assignment of the anomeric protons of the sugar moieties allows the identification of the M-C2H and GC2H features at 3.87 and 3.96 ppm, respectively, through their NOE connectivities with those anomeric protons. NOE and TOCSY correlations between GC3H and G-C1H allow the identification of the former proton at 4.05 ppm, which is confirmed through its correlation with G-C4H (3.76 ppm), that is in turn NOE connected to G-C6H/H¢ (3.49/3.39 ppm). The latter pair was identified thanks to their very clear NOE/TOCSY connectivities to each other. The correlations of this pair of signals to a feature at 3.99 ppm allowed the assignment of the latter to G-C5H. A strategy similar to that used by Haasnoot et al. [34] for the identification of M-C3H was followed in the present investigation and granted the assignment of this proton at 4.51 ppm. The SECSY connectivity of this proton to M-C4H allowed locating the 1H NMR signal of the latter at 3.68 ppm. Having previously identified the G-C6H/H¢ pair, the geminal methylene protons of mannose can be easily located at 3.86 and 3.70 ppm through the large NOE/ TOCSY correlations to each other. The close proximity in the 1H NMR spectra of the MC6H¢, M-C4H, and M-C5H signals, also observed in apo-BLM [34], makes it difficult to identify the latter. However, HMQC spectra permitted to assign this proton through its connectivity to the M-C5H carbon at $76 ppm. In summary, the NMR results described above confirm the assignments previously reported by Hecht and co-workers [11]. Additionally, the M, G, B, S, and T spin systems were fully identified in the present work, together with the resonances derived from the A-aNH2, A-CONH2, and P-CONH2 protons. Inter- and intraresidue NOEs connecting various BLM protons are also reported in this work, which allowed the structure calculations for Cu(I)BLM for the first time. Coordination sites for the Cu(I) ion Although all the signals in apo-BLM have already been assigned [34], we have repeated this work in the present

investigation with samples whose pH values were adjusted to 8.1. The spectra of these samples were run under the same conditions as those for Cu(I)BLM, with the goal of making a comparison as close a possible between the free and Cu(I)-bound states of the drug. The purpose of this comparison is to determine which features are shifted in the NMR spectra upon Cu(I) coordination. The strategy followed for the aforementioned assignments is the same as that used for Cu(I)BLM. The results are shown in Table S1 (Supplementary material). As can be seen from Table S1, the CaH, CbH, and aNH2 protons in A and the P-NH2 group are very sensitive to Cu(I) binding, since they are shifted $0.4 ppm upon metal complexation. The P-NH2 signal is deshielded upon binding of BLM to Cu(I), which strongly supports the coordination of the P-N3 to the metal center. Additionally, the comparison of the NOESY spectra of apo- and Cu(I)BLM shown in Fig. 1 indicates that the NOE connectivities observed between the A-aNH2 features in the binary complex are missing from the apo-BLM spectrum. This result supports the coordination of the A-aNH2 nitrogen to the Cu(I) center in Cu(I)BLM. Axial ligation of primary amine has been suggested by Xia et al. [39] in their 1H{15N} HSQC NMR investigation of hydroperoxide-Co(III) complexes of BLM and deglyco-bleomycin (dgBLM). The comparison depicted in Fig. 1 also shows that the NOE connectivities observed between the A-CONH2 signals in Cu(I)BLM are more intense that those detected for apo-BLM, all these results indicating a greater rotational freedom of this group in apo-BLM. The results discussed above are consistent with the participation of the A primary and secondary amines and the pyrimidine ring in binding of Cu(I). Regarding the possible participation of the imidazole ring in the first coordination sphere of the Cu(I) ion in Cu(I)BLM, the results displayed in Table S1 show that, among the protons in this moiety, the C2H and C4H are the ones most affected in the binary complex. This result is suggestive of Cu(I) coordination to the imidazole ring, although the chemical shift changes of C2H and C4H are not as significant as those displayed by some of the protons in the A and P segments. However, this fact does not preclude the participation of the imidazole as a ligand in the binary complex, as shown by Oppenheimer et al. [40]. Additionally, the general affinity of Cu(I) for imidazole coordination has been widely established through the study of many copper-binding proteins [41]. In previous NMR studies performed on various metallo-BLMs, the absence of the feature derived from the H-aNH proton has been used as an indication of the participation of the carboxamide nitrogen in coordination of divalent metals [29, 30, 36, 37, 38]. The presence of this signal in the NMR spectra of this complex detected in the present work (Fig. 3), which confirms the same fact reported earlier by Hecht and co-workers [11], indicates that this nitrogen is not a ligand to the metal center in this binary complex. The derived conclusion is

329

then that the ``equatorial plane'' of the metal in Cu(I)BLM is different from that established by consensus for all the other metallo-BLMs whose structures have been proposed so far. Chemical shift changes, with respect to the free form of the drug, of the M-C3H proton have been reported by various workers in the field to either consider or discard the participation of the carbamoyl group of this moiety in coordination of metals by BLM [29, 30, 36, 37, 38]. Additionally, the exchange rate of the protons of the MNH2 group in CoPEP (PEP=pepleomycin) and CodgPEP (dgPEP=deglyco-pepleomycin) has been used by Caceres-Cortes et al. [42] to suggest the coordination of this nitrogen by the former. In this sense, the results obtained by us indicate that for Cu(I)BLM neither the chemical shift of the M-C3H proton (Table S1) nor the exchange rate of M-NH2 (detected through the intensity of the NOE connectivities to each other, Fig. 1) evince that the carbamoyl group is part of the first coordination sphere of the metal in this complex. In summary, based on the NMR evidence gathered in this investigation, the A-NH, A-NH2, P-N3, and H-N1 are nitrogens acting as ligands to the Cu(I) ion in Cu(I)BLM. The participation of H-N1 in the first coordination sphere of the metal in the binary complex is favored by us, based on the Dd displayed by the HC2H and H-C4H protons, and in the affinity of Cu(I) for imidazole coordination [41]. Three-dimensional solution conformation of Cu(I)BLM With the elucidation of the 1H NMR spectra of Cu(I)BLM, the basis is provided for the three-dimensional structure determination of the binary complex. This will be attempted by making use of available NOE information. From these spectra, 40 non-trivial NOEs for use as distance constraints were found which are listed in Table S2, provided as Supplementary material. Before discussing the possible structural features of Cu(I)BLM, a comparison among the Cu(I), HOOCo(III) [29], and Ga(III) [30] adducts of BLM through their NOESY spectra is worth making, since the NOESY data supply much of the information used in structure calculations. The number and type of NOEs observed for these forms of the drug, besides those reported for apo-BLM, are summarized in Table S2. The comparison of the inter-residue NOE connectivities detected for Cu(I)BLM with those reported for HOO-Co(III)BLM [29] and Ga(III)BLM [30], shown in Table S2, let us see that Cu(I)BLM exhibits a structure that is more extended that those of the HOO-Co(III) and Ga(III) adducts, based on the number of this type of NOEs identified for the latter two. Between 65% {Cu(I)BLM and HOO-Co(III)BLM [29]} and 46% {Ga(III)BLM [30]} of the observed interresidue NOEs involving BLM fragments of the possible coordination cage in the metallo-BLMs compared in Table S2 include the b-hydroxyhistidine segment. As

can be seen in this table, approximately one half of these NOEs detected by us for Cu(I)BLM are not reported either for HOO-Co(III)BLM [29] or Ga(III)BLM [30]. The rest of the NOE correlations detected for Cu(I)BLM involving other residues in the coordination domain, and the majority of the remaining NOEs listed in Table S2, are also observed for HOO-Co(II)BLM and Ga(II)BLM. The NMR data on Cu(I)BLM indicate that the HaNH nitrogen is not coordinated to the Cu(I) ion in this BLM adduct. However, this nitrogen has been established as a ligand by consensus in all the other metalloBLMs and their analogs whose structures have been determined or proposed so far [7], including HOOCo(III)BLM [29] and Ga(III)BLM [30]. The differences regarding the b-hydroxyhistidine NOEs, referred to above, could in turn be caused by the differences in the structure of the metal coordination domains of the compared metallo-BLMs, owing to the non-coordination of the H-aNH nitrogen in Cu(I)BLM. NMR studies of HOO-Co(III)BLM indicated that the DNA-binding domain is folded back underneath the equatorial plane of the metal-binding domain [29, 38]. This result is supported through the detection of longrange NOEs between B-C5H and P-CH3, and B-C5H¢ and the V moiety [29]. NOEs correlating the B-C5H and P-CH3 protons are only observed in the NOESY spectra of Cu(I)BLM with a two-fold increment of the spectral scale with respect to that used to observe all the other NOEs reported in Table S2, which makes the spectra very noisy and, therefore, unreliable. The lack of reliable NOEs connecting the tail fragment with any other BLM residues in Cu(I)BLM (Table S2) suggests that the DNA binding domain has an extended conformation in this BLM adduct. Additionally, the proximity of the pyrimidine to the thiazolium rings is presumably responsible for the inequivalence of the chemical shifts of the two P-NH2 protons [29]. These two protons are degenerate in Cu(I)BLM (Fig. 3). The folding of the DNA binding domain underneath the equatorial plane in HOO-Co(III)BLM [29] brings the linker fragment close to b-hydroxyhistidine. The presence of the imidazole ring current over the V fragment causes downfield shifts for the CaH and aCH3 protons of this residue [29, 38]. The results depicted in Table S1 show that the V resonances are not perturbed upon Cu(I) coordination, implying that the linker fragment also has an extended conformation regarding the equatorial pane of the metal-binding domain. The facts aforementioned indicate that folded forms of the Cu(I)BLM molecule with a tail conformation, as reported for HOO-Co(III)BLM, are either unlikely or existing as minor species in the Cu(I)BLM samples. In summary, three facts can be extracted form this analysis. First, Cu(I)BLM exhibits a structure that is more extended that those of the HOO-Co(III) and Ga(III) adducts. Second, the non-coordination of the HaNH nitrogen to the metal center produces differences regarding the structure of the metal-binding domain

Fig. 4 Schematic drawings of the models assayed for Cu(I)BLM in the present investigation. The basal plane of coordination is formed by three nitrogens from A-NH and the pyrimidine (P-Ring) and imidazole (H-Im) rings. The primary amine nitrogen (A-NH2) (models I and II) and the carbamoyl oxygen (model III) occupy the axial positions

between Cu(I)BLM and other metallo-BLMs where this nitrogen is a ligand. Third, the solution structure of Cu(I)BLM is more extended than those proposed for HOO-Co(III)BLM [29] and Ga(III)BLM [30], and possibly exhibits an extended tail conformation. Once general aspects of the solution behavior of Cu(I)BLM have been discussed, based solely on the visual inspection of the NOESY spectra acquired for this BLM adduct, three-dimensional models can be built and assayed, regarding their compatibility with the NMR data, to propose a possible three-dimensional solution structure for this BLM complex. In this sense, three models for Cu(I)BLM (structures I­III, Fig. 4) were used as starting structures for the MD simulated annealing calculations. For all of these models, a few requirements must be satisfied. First of all, the A-NH, A-NH2, P-N5, and HN1 nitrogens must be coordinate to the metal center (vide supra). Second, connectivities correlating the bulky sugar fragments with the peptide linker, bithiazole, or tail segments of BLM have not been detected for Cu(I)BLM in the present investigation. Additionally, models where the sugar fragment shares the same side of the equatorial plane with the bithiazole tail have been

considered by us in previous studies of Fe(II)- and Co(II)BLM [32, 33]. Our experience in these cases indicates that such models are not favored by the MD results. Based on this fact, the 2-O-(3-O-carbamoyl-a-Dmannopyranosyl)-L-gulopyranose unit has been located opposite to the region occupied by the bithiazole tail segment in all the models considered. The assayed models are designed such that they are as similar as possible to pre-existing Cu(II)BLM structures [43, 44] and structures proposed for the Fe(II)BLM adduct [33]. The idea behind this rationale is to compare the best models with those structures through the two hypotheses put forth by Hecht's group [11] and Umezawa's group [45] (vide infra). Models I and II in Fig. 4 are four-coordinate, with the metal center bound to the A-NH, A-NH2, P-N5, and H-N1 nitrogens. Model I was built such that it is as similar as possible to the crystal structure of Cu(II)BLM determined by Sugiyama et al. [43], except that the HaNH nitrogen is not a ligand in the Cu(I) adduct, as suggested by NMR results from Hecht and co-workers [11] and our own data. Additionally, and also as found in the crystal structure of Cu(II)BLM, the sugar fragment is located close to the A-NH2 group, and opposite to the peptide linker segment. In model II the sugar fragment keeps the same position as in model I, but the A-NH2 ligand is coordinated to the Cu(I) ion such that part of the residue is located on the same side, with respect to the coordination cage, as the peptide linker. The relative locations of the BLM residues in this model make it similar to the Cu(II)BLM structure proposed by Takita et al. [44] and that of Fe(II)BLM proposed by us [33], both based on spectroscopic studies. Additionally, the coordination cage in this model has the same screw sense as that exhibited by the crystal structure of Cu(II).P-3A [46]. Model III is five-coordinate. Although this coordination number is slightly unfavorable for Cu(I) centers in some proteins such as azurin [47, 48, 49, 50], and our NMR data do not provide enough evidence to support the coordination of the carbamoyl oxygen to the metal center, we have considered this possibility since some five-coordinate Cu(II)BLM structures with O-carbamoyl metal binding have been proposed in various spectroscopic studies of this BLM adduct [44, 51, 52]. The B and S moieties of the BLM molecules were not included in models I­III, owing to the differences regarding these segments in the NMR spectra of these two congeners, both present in our NMR samples. The results of the molecular modeling are shown in Table 1. Regarding the two four-coordinate alternatives considered in this study, an inspection of the energy terms displayed in Table 1 indicates that model I results in a structure with higher values than those exhibited by model II. Among these energy terms, the values obtained for the non-bond and angle ones for model I reflect that it suffers more structural deformations than model II in order to satisfy the restraints. This fact is also reflected by the restraint energy term indicating that

model I demands more energy to satisfy the restraint requirements than model II. Both of the four-coordinate structures studied exhibit 10 restraint violations. However, model I violates three out of the five NOEs connecting residues located far away from each other in the BLM molecule, such as: HC2H/T-CH3, M-C6H/H-CbH, and M-C5H/H-CbH, which are satisfied by model II. NOEs other than those observed between neighboring moieties in a biopolymer are important to determine if it displays a non-extended solution conformation. On the basis of the results discussed above, model II seems to be the one that best fits the experimental data between the two four-coordinate options considered in the present study. As pointed out earlier, only one five-coordinate alternative (model III) for Cu(I)BLM was considered in this study. As shown in Fig. 4, model III presents the same ligands as models I and II, but the carbamoyl group in the mannose moiety is axially bound to the metal center. This coordination option was included, since some Cu(II)BLM structures displaying O-carbamoyl metal binding have been previously proposed [44, 51, 52]. The MD results obtained for model III are also shown in Table 1. Although comparisons between four- and five-coordinate models are not fully representative, since they embody different chemical systems, the MD results obtained for model III favor it over model I. At this point, the analysis of the MD results (Table 1) has allowed us to select model II,1 between the two fourcoordinate options, as the one that best fits the experimental data, with model III as a possible five-coordinate alternative for the solution structure of Cu(I)BLM. The calculated structures derived for models II and III are shown in Fig. 5. The plausibility for one of these two coordination geometries to be the one held in solution by the Cu(I) adduct of the drug can be discussed by considering the two different hypotheses put forth by Umezawa and colleagues [45] and Hecht and colleagues [11]. Hecht's hypothesis involves the oxidation of Cu(I)BLM to generate activated CuBLM, which in turn

can cause oxidative DNA damage. If one of our best models for Cu(I)BLM should be oxidized to become a Cu(II) adduct, the most relevant structures of Cu(II)BLM proposed so far need to be considered, to account for the structural changes possibly involved in the oxidation process. Based on the crystal structure of Cu(II)BLM determined by Sugiyama et al. [43], none of the models favored in our study seems to be adequate if Cu(I)BLM was to be oxidized to the Cu(II) form shown to be complexed to bleomycin-binding protein (BLMA) by these researchers. The coordination geometry displayed by Cu(II)BLM in the crystal structure suggests that model I, and not model II, would be the one related to the Cu(II) adduct by the simplest ligand rearrange-

332

ment, involving only the coordination of the H-NH nitrogen to the metal center upon oxidation. At this point, it is useful to consider some details of the crystal structure of free BLM complexed to BLMA, also determined by Sugiyama and co-workers [43]. As established by Sugiyama et al., the overall structure of BLM complexed with BLMA is almost the same between the metal-free BLM and the Cu(II)-bound BLM. As a way to extend the comparison of the crystal structures of free- and Cu(II)-bound BLMs, and to correlate these structures with our NMR results, we have determined which of our NOEs are satisfied by them. The results of this exercise indicate that the crystal structures for Cu(II)BLM and free-BLM satisfy the same NOEs as our model I. This fact supports the finding of Sugiyama et al. regarding the similarities existing between both crystal structures. However, as shown in Table S2, many of the NOEs detected for Cu(I)BLM are missing in the NOESY spectra of free BLM acquired in the present study. As can be seen from Table S2, the most important differences between Cu(I)BLM and free BLM in solution is observed among the residues comprising the possible coordination cage of the metal ion, showing 17 NOEs in the binary complex versus 7 detected for apo-BLM. The fact that the crystal structure of free BLM is as compact as that of Cu(II)BLM suggests that the relative location of the BLM residues in them could be somehow imposed by the BLMA protein to which both forms of BLM are bound in the crystal structures reported by Sugiyama et al. [43]. Another interesting feature of the crystal structure of Cu(II)BLM bound to BLMA is that although the metal center in it exhibits the same ligands as those bound to Cu(II) in Cu(II).P-3A [46], both structures have opposite screw senses. This structural difference could be another indication that the structure of BLMA-bound Cu(II)BLM could be strongly influenced by the binding protein. If oxidation of the Cu(I) adduct to a Cu(II) form needs to be accounted for in order to produce DNA damage as that reported by Hecht et al. [11], model II would only require H-NH coordination to become a Cu(II)BLM derivative which will have the same ligands and screw sense as that exhibited by Cu(II).P-3A in its crystal structure. Coordination of the carbamoyl group, either through the nitrogen or the oxygen atoms, in various metalloBLMs has been the subject of controversy for some time [15]. A structure for Cu(II)BLM with O-carbamoyl axial ligation has been proposed by Takita et al. [44] from spectroscopic studies, and based on the crystal structure of Cu(II).P-3A. When considering the possible oxidation of Cu(I)BLM to its Cu(II) form, either model II or model III could be regarded as precursors to a Cu(II)BLM adduct exhibiting the ligand arrangement and screw sense displayed by this proposed structure. If Cu(I)BLM is four-coordinate and has the ligand disposition displayed by model II, oxidation to Cu(II)BLM

would involve the coordination to the metal center of the H-NH nitrogen and the carbamoyl oxygen. The oxidation of the Cu(I) center in model III would only require the binding of the H-NH nitrogen to generate the Cu(II)BLM adduct suggested by Takita and co-workers [44]. If the process that involves the simplest ligand rearrangement upon oxidation is an important factor to consider in assessing our models, model III would be favored over model II as the precursor to Cu(II)BLM. The preceding discussion of the models assayed in this study in light of Hecht's hypothesis [11] points to either model II or model III, the ones selected by us as the best Cu(I)BLM structures based on our NMR and MD results, as the most likely precursors to Cu(II)BLM. Umezawa's hypothesis considers Cu(I)BLM an inactive BLM adduct that can deliver BLM to the cell nucleus where it binds Fe(II), this BLM derivative being the one responsible for DNA degradation [45]. The fitting of our models in Umezawa's hypothesis involves considerations as to which of the Cu(I)BLM structures assayed in this study could most efficiently deliver BLM to the nucleus for it to become Fe(II)BLM. In previous studies we have proposed structures for this BLM adduct which are six-coordinate with the primary amine and the carbamoyl group or a water molecule occupying the axial sites [33]. The structural role of Cu(I) as the metal center prior to the binding of Fe(II) could be thought as that of organizing the BLM molecule such that it has the right ligand arrangement to receive the Fe(II) ion. In this sense, either of the Cu(I)BLM models favored by the NMR and MD results in this study could fulfill the structural requirements to become, with only a slight ligand rearrangement, one of the two suggested structures for Fe(II)BLM. Ehrenfeld et al.'s [14] finding, indicating that the presence of both Cu and Fe could increase DNA cleavage beyond that exhibited by either metal alone, could be explained by considering Cu(I)BLM as a catalyst structurally favoring the formation of Fe(II)BLM. As established earlier in this report, the NMR data derived for Cu(I)BLM cannot be used to assert the coordination of the carbamoyl oxygen to the metal center. In this sense, model III should be considered as an option that needs further experimental support. However, in both of our favored models the A-NH2 nitrogen is bound to Cu(I) such that the b-aminoalanine residue is close in space to the peptide linker segment. This result seems to be important for models II and III to be compatible with either Umezawa's or Hecht's hypotheses. Although the results of our studies are not conclusive enough to unilaterally favor either Hecht's or Umezawa's models, the finding of a possibly extended tail conformation for Cu(I)BLM, suggested by our NMR data (vide supra), points towards a Cu(I)BLM possibly unable to cleave DNA. This fact would then support Umezawa's hypothesis if, upon Fe(II) binding, the new BLM derivative could adopt the folded tail conformation shown to be required for DNA cleavage by Wu

333

et al. [29]. Additionally, the indication of a rather extended overall structure for Cu(I)BLM, based on the small number of NOEs connecting far away BLM residues found when compared with those reported for HOO-Co(II)- and Ga(III)BLM, further supports this point.

References Conclusions
In their NMR studies on Cu(I)BLM, Hecht and coworkers [11] have suggested that this BLM adduct has a geometry distinct from Fe(II)BLM. The results of the structural investigation of this metallo-BLM described in the present report confirm this proposal regarding the geometry of Cu(I)BLM. Additionally, NMR data suggesting an extended tail conformation for Cu(I)BLM have been gathered herein. The NMR data previously reported for Cu(I)BLM [11] have been extended, allowing structural studies through molecular dynamics. Two models showing four- and five-coordination numbers (models II and III) have been proposed for the first time for this BLM adduct, as those that best fit the experimental data. These models were examined in light of the two existing hypotheses put forth by Hecht's group [11] and Umezawa's group [45] to account for the apparent inconsistency between the in vivo and in vitro data regarding the cytotoxicity of CuBLM. The coordination of the A-NH2 nitrogen, such that it is close in space to the peptide linker fragment of BLM, seems to be an important factor for our models to be compatible with these two hypotheses. The results of this analysis indicate that the selected models can be introduced either as precursors to Cu(II)BLM forms, showing the ligand arrangement and screw sense of Cu(II).P-3A [46], or the structure for Cu(II)BLM proposed by Takita et al. [44] (Hecht's model [11]), or to Fe(II)BLM, if the Fe(II) adduct displays any of the two possible coordination geometries proposed by us earlier [33] (Umezawa's model [45]). Between the two hypotheses, we are prompted to favor that supported by Umezawa and colleagues, since our NMR data suggest an extended tail conformation for Cu(I)BLM, which could render it unable to perform DNA degradation. However, more structural details about the possible intermediates taking part in the oxidative damage of DNA proposed to be caused by Cu(I)BLM oxidation are required to support this point further.
