In order to understand the structural basis for the high thermostability of phytase from Aspergillus fumigatus, its crystal structure was determined ° at 1.5 A resolution. The overall fold resembles the structure of other phytase enzymes. Aspergillus niger phytase shares 66% sequence identity, however, it is much less heat-resistant. A superimposition of these two structures reveals some significant differences. In particular, substitutions with polar residues appear to remove repulsive ion pair interactions and instead form hydrogen bond interactions, which stabilize the enzyme; the formation of a C-terminal helical capping, induced by arginine residue substitutions also appears to be critical for the enzyme's ability to refold to its active form after denaturation at high temperature. The heat-resilient property of A. fumigatus phytase could be due to the improved stability of regions that are critical for the refolding of the protein; and a heatresistant A. niger phytase may be achieved by mutating certain critical residues with the equivalent residues in A. fumigatus phytase. Six predicted N-glycosylation sites were observed to be glycosylated from the experimental electron density. Furthermore, the enzyme's catalytic residue His59 was found to be partly phosphorylated and thus showed a reaction intermediate, providing structural insight, which may help understand the catalytic mechanism of the acid phosphatase family. The trap of this catalytic intermediate confirms the two-step catalytic mechanism of the acid histidine phosphatase family.

Introduction
Phytase (EC 3.1.3.8) is a member of the histidine acid phosphatase family, which includes the mammalian lysosomal and prostatic acid phosphatase as well as phytase and acid phosphatase from bacteria, mold and yeast. Members of this family hydrolyze phosphomonoesters in two separate steps: the formation of a phosphohistidine intermediate, through a nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphomonoester; followed by the hydrolysis of the covalent intermediate by recruit T.X. and Q.L. contributed equally to this work.

ing a water molecule and releasing the histidine for the subsequent enzymatic reaction.1 ­ 3 As a component in nucleic acids, phopholipids and ATP, phosphorus is an essential nutrient for all life forms. Phytate (myo-inositio hexakisphosphate) is the main form of phosphorus storage in most foods of plant origin.4 For monogastric animals, such as chicken and pigs that lack an acid phosphatase in their body, phytase can be used as an enzymatic feed additive to improve the absorption of phosphorus, to help body growth and to reduce phosphorus excretion and environmental pollution.5 The present industrial phytase from Aspergillus niger has a deficiency as a feed additive in that 70% to 80% of its enzymatic activity is lost when it is exposed to temperatures between 55 8C and 90 8C, which may be reached

438 during the feed pelleting process.6 A highly heatresistant phytase of both economic and environmental significance to the animal industry has been characterized in the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. This phytase can withstand 100 8C for 20 minutes with only 10% activity loss.7 Further studies have shown that such hyper-thermostability reflects the capability of the enzyme to refold back to the active form after the heat is removed.6 It is interesting that A. fumigatus phytase has high sequence homology with A. niger phytase (66% sequence identity); however, they possess quite different heat-resistant properties. Considering that A. niger phytase has higher enzymatic activity and A. fumigatus phytase has higher thermostability, the crystal structure of A. fumigatus phytase may provide an accurate structural model for the protein engineering needed for A. niger phytase to acquire both high enzymatic activity and high thermostability.8 Here, we report the crystal structure of A. fumigatus phytase, carrying a phosphorylated histidine residue at the active site. Structural comparison of A. fumigatus phytase with A. niger phytase9 reveals the structural basis for their divergent thermostability and thus provides a guide for how to engineer A. niger phytase to acquire higher thermostability. The crystal structure clearly shows a partially occupied phosphohistidine residue, the transient reaction intermediate of the enzyme, at the active site. The structure of this covalent reaction intermediate presents direct structural evidence supporting the proposed two-step catalytic mechanism described earlier. Such a covalent catalytic intermediate provides further insights into understanding the catalytic pathway of A. fumigatus phytase and other members of the acid histidine phosphatase family.

glucosamine molecules were observed to bind on six out of seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn82, Asn184, Asn207, Asn316, Asn329, Asn353), which is the highest number of glycosylation sites that have been observed in the acid histidine phosphatase family (Figures 1 and 4).10 ­ 12 The active site phosphohistidine and its stabilization by hydrogen bond interactions The conserved catalytic residues, including a catalytic motif of 58RHGARXP64 and a substrate binding motif of 338HD339, are all located in the deep cleft at the interface of the large a/b domain and the small a domain. The catalytic residue His59 is at the center of this cleft (Figure 1) and is closely surrounded by four positively charged residues (Arg58, Arg62, Arg142, and His338) and one negatively charged residue (Asp339) (Figure 2). Further inspection of the difference map revealed very strong density, which can be modeled well as a phosphate (PO3) covalently linked to the N12 atom of residue His59. After maximum likelihood refinement without any constraints for the covalent phosphate, the bond distance between the phosphor and the N12 atom of His59 converged to ° 1.67 A, indicating a covalent bond between the phosphate and residue His59 (Figure 3). Based on occupancy refinement, the estimated occupancy for this phosphohistidine is about 0.3; three water molecules and an unphosphorylated His59 make

Results and Discussion
Overall structure of A. fumigatus phytase The refined structure of A. fumigatus phytase consists of 435 amino acid residues where residue His59 is phosphorylated, six N-acetylglucosamine molecules and 614 bound water molecules. The statistics for the refined structure are listed in Table 1. Resembling the fold of A. niger phytase, the A. fumigatus phytase consists of one small a domain and one large a/b domain as shown in Figure 1. A twisted six-stranded b-sandwich, in the large a/b domain, forms the core structure with two long a-helices at one side and several short a-helices flanking the opposite side. The small a domain consists of a central a-helix surrounded by seven other a-helices. Five disulfide bonds are present in the structure of A. fumigatus phytase at positions 8­ 17, 48 ­ 391, 192 ­442, 241 ­259 and 413 ­421. Two of them (Cys8 ­Cys17 and Cys192 ­ Cys442) maintain the ordered N-terminal and C-terminal structures. Six N-acetyl-

W231 and W545). Each phosphate oxygen atom is restrained by at least three hydrogen bonds (Figure 2), maintaining a stable transient intermediate structure to allow the release of alcohol and the recruitment of one water molecule. In the intermediate state, the carboxylic group of Asp339

should be protonated in order to maintain the geometry of the phosphate. Since the protein was not exposed to any phosphor compound throughout the purification and crystallization processes, the formation of this intermediate structure must have occurred either inside the cell or in the growing medium after protein secretion by the yeast. This leaves us with one explanation: some organic phosphorus compounds in the cell or the medium were dephosphorylated and trapped in the active site to form the reaction intermediate. However, even with the active-site histidine occupied and rested in the intermediate state, we still detected significant activity of the protein throughout the purification steps.13 In fact, His59 was only partially phosphorylated with occupancy 0.3 from the electron density fitting (Figure 3), which is similar to the phosphohistidine intermediate caught in the crystal structure of Therefore, the phosphoglycerate mutase.14 enzymatic activity of A. fumigatus phytase may be due to the existence of some molecules with unphosphorylated histidine residues. However, there is also the possibility that the phosphohistidine residue is unstable and susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of substrates and under acidic conditions. In conclusion, we hypothesize that the active site of the enzyme is occupied by this phosphate in a resting, closed conformation. The binding of substrates may help the hydrolysis of the reaction intermediate and the release of the hydrolysis product (phosphate). Structural basis of heat resilience In order to study A. fumigatus phytase's heatresistant property, the structure of A. niger phytase9 was chosen as a comparison model in order to

elucidate the structural basis of the heat resilience of A. fumigatus phytase. These two phytase enzymes share the highest sequence identity (66%) (Figure 4). The overall structures of the two enzymes are similar, with main chain root-mean° square (R.M.S.) deviation of only 0.78 A, yet several regions were identified that have signifi° cant R.M.S. deviations higher than 2.0 A (Figure 5). After careful inspection, three regions with greatest deviation were considered as possible factors attributing to the heat resistance of A. fumigatus phytase. These regions are Glu35 ­ Ser42, Gly163 ­ Arg168, and Arg248­ Ser254. The Glu35 ­Ser42 region involves the substitution of hydrophobic residues with acid residues, thus increasing the number of hydrogen bonding interactions; and the Gly163 ­Arg168 loop and the Arg248­ Ser254 loop regions involve ion pair interactions induced by arginine residues. Hydrogen bond network formation triggered by acidic residue substitution In the Glu35­ Ser42 region of A. fumigatus phytase, the substitution of Ala35 by Glu35 is critical for the formation of a hydrogen bond network consisting of 12 hydrogen bonds as shown in Figure 6A (left). There are five hydrogen bonds involving both Glu35 O1 atoms. The interactions between Glu35 and Ser42 make this loop stable through hydrogen bonds. The bonding distances of Glu35O11 ­Ser42Og and Glu35O12 ­ ° ° Ser42N are 2.54 A and 2.95 A, respectively. In contrast, only three hydrogen bonds exist in the equivalent region in A. niger phytase (Figure 6A (right)). Therefore, this hydrogen bond network may be a key factor in explaining the structural differences in this region between these two

phytases. It should be mentioned that the replacement of Pro42 by Ser in A. fumigatus phytase is also important. Ser42 in A. fumigatus phytase not only provides a hydrogen atom riding on the Og atom which allows additional hydrogen bond formation, but it is also more flexible than Pro42 in A. niger phytase, thus it facilitates the extension of the side-chain of residue Glu35 to form extensive hydrogen bond interactions. Optimized ion pair interaction and formation of the C-capping box structure Two salt-bridges are observed in the Gly163 ­ Arg168 and Arg248­Ser254 loops in the A. fumigatus phytase. These salt-bridges are formed by arginine residues not present in A. niger phytase and result in the removal of repulsive ion pairs in these regions. Both arginine residues interact with aspartate residues at the C termini of helices and form a so-called C-terminal capping box

structure.15 Such capping structures have been shown to significantly stabilize the helical conformation of oligopeptides.16 Removal of repulsive ion pairs can also contribute to the increased stability of proteins. Glu168 in A. niger phytase is substituted by Arg168 in A. fumigatus phytase, which is important in the formation of a C-terminal capping structure for a-helix 140 ­161 (Figure 6B (left)). The hydrogen bond distance between positive Arg168 NH2 ° atom and negative Asp161 O atom is 2.68 A, allowing a hydrogen bond at the C terminus of the a-helix. However, in A. niger phytase, an insertion of a proline residue occurs at position 166, guiding the main chain protruding into the solvent region because of the conformational constraint of this residue (Figure 6B (right)). The other C-terminal capping structure was observed at the loop region of Val246 ­Gln254, through the hydrogen bonding interaction between the side-chain NH1 atom in Arg248 and

the side-chain Od2 atom in Asp244. The hydrogen ° bonding distance is 2.90 A favoring the stabilization of a-helix 230 ­ 247, the packing center in the small a domain (Figure 6C). Supporting this observation, electron density for residues 250TVDT253 in A. niger phytase was undetectable,9 indicating some structural instability in this region in A. niger phytase due to the lack of such an ion pair interaction. A schematic C-capping box structure is shown in Figure 6D. Increased hydrogen bonding interactions and salt-bridge interactions are observed in the ° A. fumigatus phytase structure. If using 3.9 A as a cutoff distance for the hydrogen bonding interactions, there are 471 hydrogen bonds in A. fumigatus phytase and 402 hydrogen bonds in A. niger phytase. These increased hydrogen bonding interactions in A. fumigatus phytase (69 additional hydrogen bonds per molecule) may be related to the substitution of certain hydrophobic residues. These trends are consistently found in thermophilic proteins compared to their mesophilic homologs17 and mutation of a single residue that affects hydrogen bonding or ion pair interactions can significantly change the thermostability of certain proteins.18 In A. fumigatus phytase, all the highlighted regions (Figure 6) are located on the surface-exposed turns/loops. Such regions have been shown to significantly modulate protein stability.19 In A. fumigatus phytase, the Glu35­ Ser42 loop appears to stabilize the tertiary conformation of the N-terminal "lid" (b1, b2 and b3) through hydrogen bonding interactions between residues Glu35 and Ser42 (Figure 6A) and a mutation in the N-terminal lid has been shown to affect the enzymatic activity of the A. fumigatus phytase.8 Besides, the Arg248­ Ser254 loop stabilizes the helix as the packing center of the small a domain, thus stabilizing its fold. Finally, we note that the small a domain is linked to the large a/b domain in two regions (a3 and a5) and the hydrogen bond interactions in the Gly163 ­Arg168 region significantly tighten these two domains (Figure 6B). The three regions mentioned above are implicated in stabilizing the enzyme's structure. Considering that the active site of the enzyme is located deep at the interface of the large a/b domain and the small a domain, the correct assembly of these two domains may be of importance for the proteins' enzymatic activity. Because these three regions take part in the formation and stabilization of the secondary structural elements, it may be possible that there is a correlation with the refolding capability of the A. fumigatus phytase, after it has been denatured under higher temperature. The structural findings reported here are highly consistent with theoretical and experimental studies of the well-characterized folding transition state of the src SH3 domain.20 Results described here suggest that the mutation of selected residues (A35E, Q168R and T248R) in A. niger phytase may help improve its heat resistance.

Such a conclusion could be confirmed by sitedirected mutagenesis.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification and crystallization The A. fumigatus phytase gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris.13 A 300 ml culture supernatant was concentrated to 8 ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon) and dialyzed at 10 kDa cutoff against 10 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 7.4) buffer overnight (Spectrum). The dialyzed sample was then applied onto a 2.6 cm £ 10 cm DEAE-cellulose column (Sigma) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.4) buffer and developed with 300 ml 0 ­ 0.3 M NaCl gradients. A. fumigatus phytase protein was then eluted at 0.1 M NaCl; main fractions with phytase activity were pooled and equilibrated with 10 mM citrate (pH 5.5) by dialysis and deglycosylated with Endo Hf (New England Biolabs). The protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultracentrifugation (Pall Filtron) and an aliquot of 0.5 ml was loaded onto a 1.6 cm £ 60 cm Sephadex75 sizing column (Sigma) equilibrated with 10 mM citrate (pH 5.5) buffer; main fractions with phytase activity were pooled and concentrated to 5.5 mg/ml. Crystallization of this protein was carried out by using the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method at 22 8C: 2 ml of precipitant solution was mixed with 2 ml of protein solution in the drop, and 1 ml of precipitant solution was in the well. High-quality crystals with the dimensions of 0.3­ 0.6 mm were obtained by mixing 4 mg/ml of phytase protein with the solution containing 0.2 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.5) and 30% (w/v) PEG 4000 in the drop. Data collection, structure determination and refinement Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal, cooled to cryogenic nitrogen temperature. Data collection was performed at the Structural Biology Center ID beamline of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). A total of 200 frames were recorded with an oscillation angle of 1.08. Data processing was performed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK.21 The crystallographic statistics of data collection and processing are summarized in Table 1. Initial phases of the model were determined by the molecular replacement program AMoRe22 in CCP4.23 The model of A. niger (PDB entry code 1IHP) was used for rotation and translation searches and rigid body refinement, resulting in a clear solution with a correlation coefficient of 58% and R-factor of 0.40. The correct space group of P43212 was differentiated by the translation search from the space group of P41212, because the former gives a higher correlation coefficient and lower R-factor. Subsequent model building was automatically done by the use of the program Arp_warp24 and diffraction data at the full ° resolution of 1.5 A. Based on the Fo 2 Fc difference map output from Arp-warp, a covalently linked phosphate and six N-acetylglucosamine molecules were manually fitted into the model with the program O.25 After the addition of 614 water molecules by Arp_warp and maximum likelihood refinements for anisotropic temperature factors by REFMAC,26 the model finally converged to a crystallographic R-factor of 16.12% and Rfree -factor of 18.56%.
