Summary Iron is an essential element for almost all organisms, although an overload of this element results in toxicity because of the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Consequently, most living entities have developed sophisticated mechanisms to control their intracellular iron concentration. In many bacteria, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, this task is performed by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur). Fur controls a wide variety of basic physiological processes including iron uptake systems and the expression of exotoxin A. Here, we present the first crystal structure of Fur from P. aeruginosa in complex + with Zn2+ determined at a resolution of 1.8 Å. Furthermore, X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements and microPIXE analysis were performed in order to characterize the distinct zinc and iron binding sites in solution. The combination of these complementary techniques enables us to present a model for the activation and DNA binding of the Fur protein. Introduction The dynamic control of intracellular iron concentrations is of paramount importance for virtually all biological systems. One significant aspect is the fact that biologically useful iron is either extremely limited (Fe(II)) or highly insoluble (Fe(III)). Accordingly, biological entities have evolved efficient mechanisms to acquire this nutrient from

the insoluble form, which is generally available in plentiful quantities (Litwin and Calderwood, 1993; Ratledge and Dover, 2000). On the other hand, further acquisition of iron above biologically useful concentrations can have dire consequences for a cell. Excess free iron will catalyse the generation of highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates that will damage biological macromolecules (Braun and Killmann, 1999). This conflict is dealt with in a diverse array of prokaryotic microbes and, in archaea as well, by two major non-homologous classes of repressor proteins, which play a key role in controlling iron homeostasis at the level of transcription (Hantke, 2001). In contrast, this process in eukaryotic organisms occurs mainly at the level of translation through the binding of a regulatory protein to specific mRNA transcripts (Schneider and Leibold, 2000). The working functional model of these bacterial regulators is that the iron-bound holorepressor interacts with a specific target sequence (i.e. operator) near or within the promoter of an iron-regulated gene or operon, thus forming a DNA­repressor complex that blocks the access of RNA polymerase or an activator to the promoter. However, the iron-free aporepressor has a reduced affinity for the target operator sequence (`iron box') in an iron starvationinducible operon. This scenario allows the RNA polymerase or an activating factor, or both, free access to the promoters of these genes that are directly or indirectly involved in iron acquisition. Both families of these transcriptional regulators also control the iron-regulated expression of bacterial virulence determinants. One class, represented by the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR), controls the iron-regulated expression of diphtheria toxin in Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Boyd et al., 1990; Schmitt et al., 1992), whereas the second class, the ferric uptake regulator (Fur), controls the iron-regulated expression of Shiga toxin in Shigella dysenteriae, haemolysin in Escherichia coli (Ratledge and Dover, 2000) and pseudomonas exotoxin A (Prince et al., 1991). Other than their function in pathogenic processes, orthologues of both Fur and DtxR control basic physiological processes including the production and subsequent uptake of a group of ironchelating compounds collectively known as siderophores (Neilands, 1995). Fur and DtxR also control the expres-

Because DtxR and Fur are vital to the biology of host parasite interactions, and the fact that no homologues of these proteins have been found in eukaryotic organisms, they are potential targets for the rational design of antimicrobial agents. Moreover, in a number of cases, including P. aeruginosa, the gonococcus (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) and Haemophilus influenzae, these repressors are essential proteins (Prince et al., 1991; Berish et al., 1993; Akerley et al., 2002). A more recently appreciated feature of Fur proteins is that this class of repressor may be composed of several subclasses of metalloproteins with functions distinct from those gene products that were called Fur early on. The major subclass of Fur, based on considerable experimental data from genetic and biochemical analyses from a variety of microorganisms, is mainly involved in the control of iron homeostasis, but it can also function in acid tolerance and protection against oxidative stress (Hall and Foster, 1996). A second class controls the expression of genes involved in the response of bacteria to oxidative stress, but this class does not appear to be involved in the cellular response to iron (Bsat et al., 1998; Xiong et al., 2000; Zahrt et al., 2001). A third class of Fur homologues, designated Zur (zinc uptake regulator), controls the uptake of zinc in E. coli (Patzer and Hantke, 1998; 2000) and B. subtilis (Gaballa and Helmann, 1998). As more microbial genomes have been sequenced, it is apparent that many species may express more than one subclass of Fur. Furthermore, some organisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus, carry a gene encoding a DtxR homologue and a gene encoding a subclass of the Fur proteins that regulates responses to oxidative stress (Xiong et al., 2000). This protein has evidently evolved to play various functional roles. Supporting this viewpoint is the fact that Fur homologues are found in diverse organisms ranging from E. coli to Magnetococcus species and the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum, which live in vastly different environments. In contrast to the extensive homology between the different functional subclasses of Fur, DtxR and Fur do not have any obvious primary amino acid similarity. In addition, Fur has only around 135 residues, whereas DtxR is significantly larger by nearly 100 residues that form an additional C-terminal SH3-like third domain (Boyd et al., 1990; Prince et al., 1991; Qiu et al., 1996; Feese et al., 2001). Both Fur and DtxR are functional iron concentration regulators, and recent data suggest that there may be structural similarities between their DNA-binding domains (Gonzalez de Peredo et al., 2001). Both regulators are also dimeric metalloproteins that change conformation in response to divalent transition metal cations and, although the consensus DNA-binding sequence for Fur and DtxR are different, both binding sites are represented by two 9 bp palindromes flanking a single basepair (Tao and Murphy, 1992; Ochsner and Vasil, 1996). A large number of crystal structures of apo- and holo-DtxR alone (Qiu et al., 1995; Schiering et al., 1995; Ding et al., 1996; Pohl et al., 1998; 2001), in complex with DNA (White et al., 1998; Pohl et al., 1999a) as well as one of its orthologues, iron-dependent regulator (IdeR) from M. tuberculosis (Pohl et al., 1999b), have been determined but, until this report, no three-dimensional structure of a Fur protein has yet been elucidated. In this communication, we report the first crystal structure of a member of the Fur/Zur family: the holoregulator from P. aeruginosa in complex with zinc. In addition, we provide spectroscopic data indicating that the functional holorepressor dimer of PA-Fur contains one distinct Zn and one Fe binding site per monomer.

Results Overall structure The crystal structure of PA-Fur was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) and refined to a minimum Bragg spacing of 1.8 Å (Table 1). In the crystal structure, the molecule is located on a crystallographic twofold axis that generates the functional dimer. The basic fold consists of two domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (residues 1­83 shown in blue in Fig. 1A) and a Cterminal dimerization domain (residues 84­135 depicted in green). The DNA-binding domain is composed of four helices followed by a two-stranded antiparallel b-sheet. This domain exhibits the typical winged helix (WH) motif in which the three-helix bundle H2, H3 and H4 contains the putative DNA-binding helix H4 (Gly-50­Ala-64) (Huffman and Brennan, 2002). The dimerization domain of each PA-Fur monomer consists of an a/b-domain in which three antiparallel b-strands (S3, S4, S5) are covering one long a-helix (H5). Both structural elements are involved in forming the functional protein dimer. The bstrands are part of a six-stranded sheet structure that connects the two monomers (see view along the twofold axis in Fig. 1B). Furthermore, there are numerous hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions of the a-helix H5 with the symmetry-related a-helix H5¢. Residues Asp-103 and Arg-109 form salt bridges to Arg-109¢ and Asp-103¢ respectively. These residues are moderately conserved in the Fur family, and the Asp-103Gly PA-Fur mutant has been reported to show reduced DNA-binding affinity

(Barton, 1997). Other residues of the loop after helix H5, such as Phe-119, interact with the last b-strand of the second monomer. This arrangement forms an extensive largely hydrophobic dimerization interface with a buried surface of ª 1300 Å2. The DNA-binding domains of PA-Fur and DtxR share the same basic fold with one important difference. PA-Fur contains an additional N-terminal helix (residues 2­9) that may be involved in DNA recognition, as will be discussed below. Although there is no significant sequence similarity detectable, the single DNA-binding domains from both regulators superimpose well with an r.m.s.d. of 1.8 Å for the 60 structurally equivalent Ca-atoms of helices H2 to H4 and strands S1 and S2 (Fig. 2A). The dimer formation, however, is different and leads to a completely dissimilar orientation of the two DNA-binding domains with respect to each other. This is illustrated in Fig. 2B, where the same superposition is applied to the full dimer. When the central DNA-binding motifs are superimposed, the second monomers of PA-Fur and DtxR are located on opposite sides. Furthermore, the relative orientation of the two DNA recognition helices with respect to each other is completely different. Whereas in DtxR, the DNA-binding helices are nearly parallel, these helices are oriented almost perpendicular to each other in PA-Fur. This orientation of the DNA-binding motif has important consequences for the way in which DNA is recognized and is discussed in detail below. The overall architecture of PA-Fur is reminiscent of DtxR with similar DNA-binding elements, but the dimerization domain is unique, shows no resemblance to DtxR or any other dimeric repressor, and leads to an entirely different dimer arrangement.

ZnSO4, it is important to note that it has been shown previously by DNA sequence-specific footprint analysis that Zn(II) alone is able to activate PA-Fur in vitro (Ochsner et al., 1995). In the crystal structure, two functionally important Zn binding sites were identified per monomer (two more Zn sites are located between two symmetry-related dimers and are most probably important for crystal packing only). Site 1 is located in the dimerization domain of PA-Fur and is co-ordinated by the side-chains of residues His-86, Asp-88, Glu-107 and His-124. The co-ordination sphere of this site can be described as distorted octahedral with the side-chain of Asp-88 ligating as a symmetrical bidentate. A wellordered water molecule with a refined B-factor of 31 Å2 is then completing the co-ordination sphere (Fig. 3A). The second Zn binding site is co-ordinated by the side-chain atoms of residues His-32, Glu-80, His-89 and Glu-100 (Fig. 3B), where the metal possesses a regular tetrahedral environment. All metal to ligand distances are in the expected range for Zn atoms (see Table 2). The average distances for Zn-O in carboxylates and for Zn-N of histidines found in the protein database are 2.00 Å and

2.04 Å respectively (Harding, 2001). It is noteworthy that metal binding site 1 is entirely ligated by residues of the dimerization domain, whereas site 2 forms a bridge to the DNA-binding domain. This observation clearly points to different functions for these two distinct metal sites. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and MicroPIXE analysis In order to investigate the metal binding in solution, the PA-Fur sample was dialysed against a Fe(II) solution and then characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis (George et al., 1998). The experimental spectrum at the Fe absorption edge (Fig. 4A) with an edge energy of 7121.7 eV confirms the expected oxidation state

of Fe(II). Furthermore, the relative small pre-edge region (7.8 ¥ 10-2 eV) is characteristic of weak 1s-3d transitions that indicate a five- or sixfold co-ordinated metal centre. The EXAFS Fourier transform shown in Fig. 4B is dominated by a single peak with contributions from the surrounding N- and O-atoms. Any participation of sulphur can clearly be ruled out. Subsequent refinement of the metal environment reveals two N-atoms and three O-atoms with an average distance of 2.07 Å and a fourth O-atom 2.54 Å away in the first co-ordination sphere. All these features are consistent with the metal binding site 1 found in the crystal structure (see metal to ligand distances in Table 2). Thus, this site may represent the putative regulatory Fe binding site. Recent data from three separate laboratories strongly suggest that the apo-form of E. coli Fur (EC-Fur), in addi© 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 47, 903­915

tion to containing an iron binding site, possesses at least one Zn(II) ion in each monomer that is co-ordinated by the cysteine residues at positions 92 and 95 (Fig. 5) (Jacquamet et al., 1998; Gonzalez de Peredo et al., 1999). However, PA-Fur contains only a single cysteine at position 92, and Fur from Xanthomonas campestris has neither of the Cys residues. In order to elucidate the Zn binding of PA-Fur, we performed XAS scans on the Znabsorption edge using the same Fe-Fur sample. The detected fluorescence around the Zn-edge (9665.5 eV) unequivocally confirmed the presence of this metal in the protein (Fig. 4C), although no zinc was used during the purification and the protein sample was dialysed only against Fe(II)-containing buffer. Evidently, PA-Fur also

contains a high-affinity Zn binding site that cannot be exchanged by Fe(II) and, therefore, is most likely structurally important. The XANES region of the spectrum indicates that the Zn(II) is in a tetragonal environment, and the EXAFS pattern (Fig. 4D) is again dominated by a single contribution corresponding to N- and O-atoms. Any contribution from ligating sulphur atoms can be unambiguously excluded. Subsequent refinement indicates two Nand two O-atoms at distances of 2.0 Å, which are typical of histidine, glutamate and aspartate residues (Harding, 2001). The co-ordination sphere of this site is consistent with metal binding site 2 in the crystal structure (see also Table 2). Thus, we suggest that position 2, which connects the DNA-binding and the dimerization domains, repre-

sents the structural Zn binding site. In order to determine the ratio of metals per monomer in solution, a microPIXE analysis was performed using the same protein sample (Garman, 1999). This analysis confirmed the presence of almost equimolar amounts of Zn and Fe. As all metalbinding residues found in the crystal structure of PA-Fur are conserved in EC-Fur (see Fig. 5), it is likely that these regulators share the same Zn and Fe binding sites. In addition, EC-Fur may possess another structurally important Zn binding site possibly involving the C-

terminal Cys-132­X4­Cys-137 motif, which is not present in PA-Fur. This putative Zn site could explain the spectroscopic evidence of a sulphur-containing Zn environment in EC-Fur (Althaus et al., 1999; Gonzalez de Peredo et al., 1999). Moreover, we have noted that some monoclonal antibodies raised against PA-Fur react only weakly or not at all with EC-Fur (Barton, 1997). Taken together, these data suggest that there are some notable structural differences and possibly some functional differences between PA-Fur and EC-Fur.

Discussion Metal-binding and activation mechanism The two metal binding sites identified in the crystal structure of PA-Fur obviously possess different functions. It seems plausible that the Zn site at position 2 plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the protein structure and, hence, loss of this metal might lead to partial unfolding and/or aggregation as this metal was maintained in the protein during sample preparation. In contrast, metal binding site 1 can be exchanged by iron. Therefore, this position may correspond to the regulatory site. Here, the metal is ligated by two residues following the loop that links the DNA-binding to the dimerization domains, and metal binding could lead to a small local conformational change, which in turn could alter the orientation of the DNA-binding domains in the Fur dimer

significantly with respect to each other. Thus, metal binding may activate the regulator by inducing a hinge motion of the DNA-binding domain with respect to the dimerization domain. DNA binding of PA-Fur A critical issue in terms of the structure­function relationships of PA-Fur is how the regulator interacts with its operator site to block the access to the promoter region of an iron-responsive gene. The crystal structure of the PA-Fur dimer clearly suggests that the putative DNA-binding helices H4 and H4¢ contact the major groove of DNA. Thus, the dimer was docked manually to canonical B-DNA bearing the pvdS recognition site (Fig. 6A). The model shows that these helices fit into the major groove well and that only relatively small conformational changes are required to avoid overlap. In addition, the model demon-

The metal binding sites that are annotated are based on the crystal structure and the spectroscopic data presented here. Mutations on PA-Fur noted are those that were found to affect the function in P. aeruginosa and in vitro experiments (Prince et al., 1991; Barton, 1997). The N-terminal G and S noted by * are not present in the native but in the recombinant PA-Fur.

strates that the loop between the N-terminal helices H1 and H2 may be involved in DNA recognition. This notion is supported further by the observation that the Ala-10Gly PA-Fur mutant fails to protect the pvdS promoter region (Barton et al., 1996). Residue Ala-10 is located at the Nterminal end of helix H1, and the Ala to Gly mutation may cause partial unfolding of this region, thus abolishing DNA-binding activity. In the context of the model shown in Fig. 6A, the binding of a single PA-Fur dimer would not be expected to protect more than ª 20 bp in a DNase I protection assay. However, it is important to note that Fur has never been shown to protect <27­30 bp (Ochsner and Vasil, 1996; Escolar et al., 2000). Therefore, two PAFur dimers were docked to DNA where the two dimers follow the pseudo twofold symmetry of the DNA sequence. The best model obtained with a spacing of 5 bp shows that the two dimers are located on opposite sides of the DNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 6B). There is significant overlap of the DNA-binding domains, and this would suggest a conformational change in the DNA upon binding of Fur. In this regard, a modest amount of DNA bending associated with Fur binding has been detected using a circular permutation assay with the pvdS operator sequence (Barton, 1997) The ternary model presented

here is consistent with the suggestion that Fur recognizes arrays of three or more hexameric sites (Escolar et al., 1998). The central hexamer region would be in contact with both dimers, whereas the flanking regions are recognized by only one dimer. Furthermore, the ternary model allows additional Fur dimers to bind when adjacent Fur binding sites are present. For example, EC-Fur protects as many as 100 bp of the aerobactin promoter region of E. coli (Escolar et al., 2000), and PA-Fur protects 63 bp of the pvdS promoter of P. aeruginosa (Ochsner et al., 1999). However, these larger protected sites are considerably less common than the 30 (±3) bp operator sites found in a majority of known Fur-regulated genes. Moreover, regulation of the pvdS promoter is considerably more complex than that of most other genes that are directly Fur regulated. There are two separate transcriptional initiation sites for the PvdS gene: the promoter region of this gene has two, non-overlapping, Fur boxes, and expression of the PvdS gene is differentially regulated by oxygen tension (Vasil and Ochsner, 1999). In conclusion, the crystal structure of the PA-Fur dimer in complex with Zn2+ presented here reveals the overall two-domain architecture of this central bacterial regulator. The a-helical DNA-binding domain is similar to that of

DtxR and other functionally related proteins; however, the position of both domains with respect to each other in the functional dimer is completely different. The structure shows a novel a/b dimerization domain that is also involved in metal binding. Combining the crystallographic with the spectroscopic data in solution enabled us to differentiate between the putative structural Zn binding site and the regulatory Fe binding site. This distinction is of particular importance for future structure-based inhibitor/

activator design studies, in which the regulator site is to be targeted. In addition, based on our results, we concluded that, like the DtxR regulator, two dimers of PA-Fur may bind to a single operator that is no less than 27 bp in length. This model clearly has implications concerning the concentration of Fur in cells and the identification of potential compounds that might have antimicrobial activity by virtue of altering the function of Fur. It has been estimated that there are between 5000 and 10 000 molecules

Pohl et al. of Fur per cell, but only a three- to fourfold reduction in the level of PA-Fur causes derepression of iron starvationinducible genes and an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress (Ochsner et al., 1999; Zheng et al., 1999). The functionality of Fur in a cell could be compromised if its effective concentration decreases by a relatively modest amount, because our model suggests that at least two dimers and sometimes more are needed to cause full repression of iron starvation-inducible genes. Accordingly, it may be sufficient to alter the function of PA-Fur only partially in order to disrupt the ability of a pathogenic microbe to survive the host oxidative defences. Clearly, further structural studies are needed to determine the architecture of the Fur­DNA complex. Crystallization, structure determination and refinement
Crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour diffusion method by mixing the protein solution in a ratio of 1:1 with a reservoir solution containing 40% ethylene glycol, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.0, and 10 mM ZnSO4. The crystals are tetragonal with a = b = 63.2 Å, c = 180.1 Å, space group P4222. All diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the EMBL wiggler beam lines BW7A equipped with a Mar CCD detector and BW7B with an imaging plate scanner and processed with HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Three Zn sites per monomer were located with the Patterson superposition minimum function implemented in SHELXS (Sheldrick, 1998) and refined using SHARP (de la Fortelle and Bricogne, 1997). Solvent flattening with DM (Cowtan and Main, 1998), which is part of the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994), produced a map of high quality, and 80% of the residues were automatically traced using WARP/ARP (Perrakis et al., 1999). Further data collection and phasing statistics are summarized in Table 1. The refinement against the 1.8 Å native data was completed by iterative cycles of interactive model building using O (Jones et al., 1991) and crystallographic refinement using a maximum likelihood target function with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The final crystallographic model includes residues 1­28, 30­135, four Zn2+ ions and 126 solvent molecules. The metal sites were refined without any target values for the distances, and the van der Waals' and electrostatic terms were switched off. The sidechains of residues 13, 87 and 132­134 are invisible in the electron density map and were thus refined as alanines. The protein shows excellent stereochemistry with no outliers in the Ramachandran plot, and 94% of all residues in the most favoured region as indicated by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Further refinement statistics are summarized in Table 3.

Experimental procedures Protein preparation
Previous efforts in our laboratory to purify native PA-Fur from a T-7 expression system in P. aeruginosa yielded active PAFur (Ochsner et al., 1995). However, all attempts to crystallize this protein failed. During our earlier efforts, we noticed that our preparations of the native Fur contained two closely migrating bands on native PAGE, both of which reacted against monoclonal antibodies against PA-Fur. However, on SDS-PAGE, this PA-Fur preparation only migrated as a single band. As we used metal-chelating sepharose in our purification protocols, we considered that we might be stripping a metal (e.g. Fe2+ or Zn2+) critical to the native structure of PAFur when it was eluted from the metal-sepharose column by imidazole or EDTA. Consequently, the PA-Fur gene was cloned into pGEX-2T, which fused the 3¢ end of the gene encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST), in frame with the ATG initiation codon of the PA-Fur gene. The GST­PA-Fur fusion gene was expressed from the plasmid tac promoter in E. coli DH5a. The cells were lysed, and the soluble GST­PAFur in the cytoplasmic fraction was bound to glutathionesepharose. The GST-sepharose was extensively washed, and PA-Fur was thrombin cleaved from the GST­PA-Fur bound to the glutathione-sepharose. Recombinant PA-Fur purified in this manner contains additional Gly and Ser residues attached to the N-terminal Met of the native protein. The recombinant PA-Fur produced mobility shifts identical to those produced by native PA-Fur, over three protein concentrations, using the promoter region of pvdS (data not shown). For crystallization experiments, the protein was concentrated to 14 mg ml-1 in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 10% glycerol. For the XAS analysis, the purified protein sample was dialysed overnight against a solution of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM of Fe(II), 10% glycerol and then twice against a metal-free solution. PA-Fur was then concentrated to ª 10 mg ml-1. The Fe-Fur sample for microPIXE analysis was prepared by dialysing the sample used for EXAFS analysis against a solution of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaBr, 10% glycerol, 1 mM ascorbic acid. Chloride- and sulphurcontaining compounds had to be avoided in order to reduce the background in the microPIXE measurements.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy
The XAS spectra are obtained at 25 K from a shock-frozen sample in a plastic cuvette with polyimide windows. All data were collected at the EMBL beam line D2 of the DORIS III storage ring at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. Beam line D2 is equipped with a Si(111) monochromator and a focusing mirror. The energy ranges used for the refinement and Fourier transform shown in Fig. 4 were: Fe: Dk = 3­12.5 Å-1; Zn: Dk = 3­12 Å-1. Data reduction was performed with the program EXPROG (Nolting and Hermes, 1992), and the restrained refinement was done using EXCURV98 (Binsted et al., 1992). The Fermi energy was refined to -3.08 eV for Fe (E0 = 7120 eV) and -8.4 eV for Zn (E0 = 9660 eV). The fit index increased significantly for a co-ordination number of 4 for the Fe site (fit index = 5.0) and for a higher co-ordination number than 4 for zinc (fit index = 4.6). Further details of the refinement are summarized in Table 4.

MicroPIXE analysis
Proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) is an analytical tool for the identification of atoms in a sample, for instance a protein solution. For the microPIXE analysis, a 3 MeV proton beam of 1 mm diameter was used to induce characteristic X-ray emission from protein drops of 0.2 ml dried on 2-mm-thick mylar film. These X-rays were then detected in a high-energy resolution lithium-drifted silicon detector. The proton beam was scanned across the drop, and the resulting X-rays were sorted into elemental maps. Both zinc and iron were clearly detectable and were measured to be at approximately equimolar concentrations (data not shown).
