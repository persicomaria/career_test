Proliferating lymphocytes contain an intracellular factor, ADR (activator of DNA replication), which can initiate DNA synthesis in isolated quiescent nuclei. Resting lymphocytes lack ADR activity and contain an intracellular inhibitory factor that suppresses DNA synthesis in normal but not transformed nuclei. In this study we describe a MOLT-4 subline that produces both the activator and inhibitory activities which can be separated by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The inhibitor is heat stable and inhibits ADR-mediated DNA replication in a dose-dependent manner. It does not inhibit DNA polymerase 01activity. The inhibitor must be present at the initiation of DNA replication to be effective, as it loses most of its effectiveness if it is added after replication has begun. The presence of inhibitory activity in proliferating MOLT-4 cells, taken with the previous observation that inhibitor derived from normal resting cells does not affect DNA synthesis by MOLT-4 nuclei. suggests that failure of a down-regulating signal may play an important role in proliferative disorder.

INTRODUCTION As part of the complex response to proliferative stimuli, lymphocytes produce an intracellular factor, ADR (activator of DNA replication), which can initiate DNA replication in isolated quiescent nuclei (1, 2). This factor appears in the cytosolic fraction lo- 12 hr after PHA stimulation, coincident with the initial round of cellular DNA synthesis. ADR activity has been found in both mitogen-activated normal lymphocytes and spontaneously proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines, but is absent in quiescent lymphocytes (1). Similar activities have been reported in extracts prepared from tumor cell lines (3) Xenopus embryos (4), and EGF-stimulated fibroblasts (5). Blocking IL-2 production with dexamethasone in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes blocks both the appearance of ADR activity and cellular DNA synthesis, and both are restored by the addition of exogenous IL-2 (2). This demonstrates that in lymphocytes the generation of ADR activity occurs after the interaction between IL-2 and its receptor. Further, when lymphocytes from aged donors which show a diminished mitogenic response to PHA are used as a source of nuclei, there is a correlation between the ability of isolated lymphocyte nuclei to replicate their DNA in response to exogenous ADR and the ability of the intact lymphocytes to proliferate in response to mitogen (6). The parallel occurrence and regulation of ADR activity and cellular DNA synthesis,

and the parallel decrease of nuclear ADR response and proliferation, indicate that this activity plays an important role in regulating the initiation of DNA synthesis in vivo. Extracts from quiescent lymphocytes not only lack ADR activity, but they contain a factor which actively inhibits both ADR-induced DNA replication in quiescent nuclei and ongoing DNA synthesis in nuclei from activated, proliferating lymphocytes (7, 8). The ADR inhibitory activity resides on a heat-stable protein with a native molecular weight of greater than 50,000 Da. In contrast to the near-complete inhibition of DNA synthesis in normal nuclei, nuclei from three transformed cell lines were unresponsive to the PBL-derived ADR inhibitor in the cell-free assay(7). The inability of this factor to inhibit DNA replication in transformed nuclei may be an important factor in the continuous proliferation of transformed cells. In the present study, cytosolic extracts prepared from the MOLT-4 human T cell leukemia cell line are used asthe source of ADR. These unfractionated extracts induce the incorporation of up to 1 pmol of [3H]dTTP into isolated nuclei. Incorporation of more than 1 pmol is not seen at higher concentrations of extract. This upper limit is increased fivefold when partially purified ADR is used instead of unfractionated cytoplasmic extracts. The initial upper limit is shown to be due to the presence of an inhibitory activity in the unfractionated cytosolic extract, which is separatedfrom the ADR activity by the initial fractionation step. The inhibitor shares several properties with the inhibitor found in the cytoplasm of quiescent PBL (7). The presence of both ADR and the ADR inhibitor in a MOLT-4 subline is consistent with the hypothesis that the continuous proliferation of this cell line is due to the lack of nuclear response to the ADR inhibitor, rather than impaired inhibitor production or the production of a dysfunctional inhibitor. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture. The human T cell leukemia cell line MOLT-4 (ATCC) was grown in RPM1 1640 supplemented with 10%heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, NY), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 pg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% C02/95% humidified air environment. The subline used to isolate the inhibitor activity had been grown in continuous culture in this laboratory for over 1 year. Preparation of cytoplasmic extracts. Extracts were prepared as described earlier (1). Briefly, the cells were centrifuged, counted, and resuspended at a density of 5 X 10' cells/ml in an ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 20 mM Hepes pH 7.8, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mJ4 MgQ, and 0.5 mM DTT (solution E). After they were incubated 8 min on ice, the cells were homogenized by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (large pestel), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min. The supematant was adjusted to 0.1 M sucrose/10 mM KC1 and centrifuged at 140,OOOg 60 min. The supematants for were collected and kept on ice until used in assays,or stored in 3-ml aliquots at -70°C. Supernatants could be stored at -70°C for 1-3 months with no loss of ADR activity. Preparation of isolated nuclei. Adult frogs (Xenopus laevis) were purchased from Nasco (Ft. Atkinson, WI). Isolated nuclei were prepared by detergent lysis of single spleen cell suspensions, as described previously (1). Assayfor initiation of DNA synthesis (ADR activity) in isolated nuclei. Assayswere performed in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates as described (1). Each well receives

40 ~1 of solution 4 (25 mIt4 Hepes, pH 7.8, 2% (w/v) dextran, 0.25 M sucrose), 50 ~1 of the cytoplasmic extract (or other ADR-containing solution), and 10 ~1 of nuclei (2 X 10' nuclei/ml). The reaction is initiated by the addition of 50 ~1 of an incorporation mixture (38 mA4 Hepes, pH 7.8, 12.5 miI4 phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 mA4 ATP, 10 U/ ml pyruvate kinase, 100 mM KCl, 125 mM MgClz, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 125 mA4 sucrose, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 rnI4 dGTP, and 0.5 mM dCTP) and 3 ~1 [methyl-3H]dTTP (1 mCi/ml, 40-70 Ci/mmol; I Ci = 37 GBq, New England Nuclear). In the standard assay the plates were incubated for 90 min at 37°C; for kinetic experiments the incubation time was varied. Control triplicate wells measured the incorporation of nuclei alone and extract alone. Duplicate time-zero plates measured nonspecific incorporation, and these values were subtracted from the postincubation counts. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was stopped with NaOH, and the nuclei harvested as described ( 1). Preparation of 30-50% ammonium sulfate fractions. A measured volume of cytoplasmic extract (usually between 20-40 ml) was added to a 50-ml disposable test tube along with sufficient solid ammonium sulfate (AS) to bring the solution to 30% AS saturation. The AS was dissolved by gentle rocking at 4°C. Following a 1-hr incubation at 4°C the contents were transferred to Corex tubes and centrifuged at 17,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was brought to 50% AS saturation, incubated at 4°C and centrifuged. The precipitate was resuspended in solution E (one-half of the original volume) and dialyzed against solution E overnight at 4°C. This fraction contained over 90% of the total ADR activity. Assay for ADR inhibitor activity. The solution being assayed for inhibitor activity (or a dilution of it) was mixed with an equal volume of the 30-50% AS fraction in a 1.5-ml microfuge tube and allowed to incubate on ice for 10 min. This mixture was then used in place of the cytoplasmic extract (50 &well) in the ADR assay as described above. For timecourse experiments, 25 &well of 30-50% AS fraction was added at the initiation of the reaction, and 25 &well of 50-70% AS fraction was added at intervals. The reaction was stopped after 90 min and the plates were harvested as above. Assayfor DNA polymerase activity. Each well received 50 ~1 of solution 4, 25 ~1 of the cytoplasmic extract (or the solution to be assayed for polymerase activity), and 25 ~1 of 0.83 mg/ml activated calf thymus DNA (Sigma) in solution 4. Activated calf thymus DNA is double-stranded DNA which has been briefly incubated with DNase I to create polymerase initiation sites (9). The reaction is initiated by the addition of 50 ~1 of incorporation mixture and 3 ~1 [methyl-3H]dTTP. The plates were incubated for 120 min at 37°C and harvested as above. RESULTS

Eflect of Partial Purification on Limiting Levels of ADR-Mediated [3H]dTTP Incorporation
As shown previously, ADR activity in cytosolic extracts precipitates when the level of ammonium sulfate (AS) saturation is between 30 and 50% (1). Comparisons of the [3H]dTTP incorporation induced by cytoplasmic extracts with those induced by 3050% AS fractions of those extracts revealed that the AS fractions could induce five times more [3H]dTTP incorporation than their parent extracts. Dose-response experiments showed that this was not simply due to an increase in specific activity, as

FIG. 1. Dose-response behavior of ADR activity in unfractionated cytosolic extracts and in 30-50% AS fractions. Dilutions of extracts and 30-50% AS fractions were assayed for the ability to stimulate [3H]dTTP incorporation into isolated nuclei as described under Materials and Methods. Peak incorporation was 255,000 cpm and background incorporation did not exceed 2700 cpm.

different saturating conditions could be achieved for both. As shown in Fig. 1, the unfractionated extract stimulated a maximum incorporation of approximately 1 pmol of [3H]dTTP; further addition produced no increase in incorporation. In contrast, the 30-50% AS fraction stimulated incorporation of up to 6 pmol, thus, the plateau reached by the crude extract was not due to limitations of the nuclei nor the incorporation assay. A comparison of the incorporation timecourses mediated by crude extracts and 3050% AS fractions demonstrates that the plateau reached by the crude extract is a welldefined limit for all concentrations tested (Fig. 2). Even after 3 hr of incubation, no additional increase in incorporation is seen. Thus, using the crude extract, there is a limit to the nuclear incorporation which is concentration-independent over the range tested.When the 30-50% AS fraction is used,incorporation is greaterand concentration dependent. Thus, partial purification removes a limit to incorporation. MOLT-4 Cytoplasmic Extracts Contain an Activity That Inhibits ADR Activity The previous results showed that the ADR activity in unfractionated extracts was inhibited, and that the inhibition was lost following ammonium sulfate fractionation

of the crude extract. This suggested that there is an inhibitory factor in the crude extract which either precipitated prior to 30% saturation or remained in solution at 50% saturation. Accordingly, we performed mixing experiments in which various ammonium sulfate precipitation fractions of a MOLT-4 extract was added to a 3050% AS fraction (Table 1). In comparison to the buffer control, the bulk of the inhibitory activity was found in fractions of greater than 50% saturation. The results are plotted as percentage inhibition in Fig. 3.

Properties of the MOLT-4 ADR Inhibitor
A large volume (220 ml) of 50% AS supernatants was pooled and AS was added to 70% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 ml of solution E, and dialyzed against solution E overnight. This 50-70% AS fraction had high levels of ADR inhibitor activity and this partially purified fraction was used as the source of the inhibitor in all subsequent experiments. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, the 50-70% AS fraction inhibited ADR activity in a dose-dependent manner, and at the highest concentration tested inhibited over 90%

of the initial ADR activity. The inhibitory activity was unaffected by a 30-min incubation at 56°C a condition which completely inactivates ADR activity (Fig. 5). This inhibition of [3H]dTTP incorporation was not due to inhibition of DNA polymerase a! activity. The ADR inhibitor has no effect on DNA polymerase activity as measured by the incorporation of [3H]dTTP into activated calf thymus DNA. The control [3H]dTTP incorporation was 7.6 + 0.2 pmol and 7.1 + 0.4 pmol in the presence of a 1:1 dilution of the 50-70% AS fraction. This dilution of the 50-70% AS fraction inhibited over 90% of the ADR activity. Timecourse of inhibitor action. As shown in Fig. 4, when the highest concentration of the ADR inhibitor is preincubated with the 30-50% AS fraction prior to the addition of nuclei, the ADR activity is over 90% inhibited. Fig. 6A illustrates the effect of this concentration of inhibitor on ADR-mediated [3H]dTTP incorporation when it is added at various timepoints after the addition of ADR to nuclei (in contrast to the previous experiments which involved preincubation of ADR and ADR inhibitor). When the inhibitor is added at the beginning of the assay, there is almost 100% inhibition. A delay of 15 min in adding the inhibitor reduces inhibition by 50%. A delay of 30 min reduces the inhibitory activity by 75%. The parallel timecourse in which [3H]dTTP

FIG. 6. Addition of ADR inhibitor (A) or NaOH (B) during a YO-min ADR assay. ADR assays were initiated by the addition of 25 ~1 of partially purified ADR to wells containing nuclei, incorporation mixture, and [3H]dTTP. At 15min intervals six wells received 25-4 aliquots of 50-70s AS fraction (inhibitor) and the incubation continued until 90 min after the addition of ADR, at which point all wells which had received the 50-70s AS fraction were harvested. In duplicate plates at 15min intervals, six wells received 1.35 M NaOH rather than inhibitor and were harvested immediately.

incorporation was stopped with NaOH (Fig. 6b) at the various timepoints, thus showing the actual incorporation at these times, revealed that almost no [3H]dTTP had actually been incorporated at 15 min and that only 20% of the eventual total had been incorporated by 30 min, in spite of the fact that these are the times at which the inhibitor is maximally effective. Experiments in which 30-50% ammonium sulfate fractions were preincubated at 37" for up to 2 hr prior to the addition of nuclei showed no loss of activity; thus, the kinetic profiles are not affected by the decay of replicative activity during the assay (data not shown). DISCUSSION Our previous investigations have demonstrated the presence of ADR activity in extracts prepared from activated lymphocytes and continuously proliferating cell lines, and the presence of an ADR inhibitor in quiescent lymphocytes (1, 2, 7). The ADR inhibitor could successfully prevent DNA replication in nuclei from normal cells, but was ineffective in preventing DNA replication in nuclei from several transformed cell lines, including MOLT-4 (8). This raised the possibility that in some transformed cells,

growth regulatory mechanisms could induce the production of the ADR inhibitor in a futile attempt to halt cell proliferation. In the present experiments, comparison of the dose-response curves of unfractionated MOLT-4 cytoplasmic extracts with the 30-50% AS fraction of that extract suggestedthat the crude extract did, in fact, contain an inhibitory activity that was not present in the 30-50% AS fraction. This is most clearly seen in the kinetic studies (Fig. 2) in which the crude extract reaches a concentration-independent limit, while the 30-50% AS fraction has higher, concentrationdependent limits of incorporation. An increase in the maximum incorporation and the appearance of concentration dependence cannot be due to a simple increase in ADR concentration in the 30-50% AS fraction. When MOLT-4 extracts were fractionated by AS precipitation, an inhibitory activity was found to precipitate between 50 and 70% AS saturation. Several results indicate that most of the incorporation seenin the assayis the result of DNA replication and not repair. Characteristics of DNA replication have been observed by several laboratories using identical or parallel assayswith isolated nuclei, including the presence of fork and eye structures in the post-assay DNA and the appearanceof label initially in small DNA fragments which appearedin large fragments following incubation with a large excessof unlabeled deoxynucleotide (3, 4). In our assaysincorporation can be blocked by aphidicolin and n-ethylmaleimide (Coffman and Oglesby, unpublished), suggesting the involvement of DNA polymerase (Yor 6. Over 60% of the incorporation is inhibited by a monospecific autoantibody against PCNA, a processivity factor for DNA polymerase 6 (lo), and over 70% is inhibited by SJK 287-38 (1 l), a neutralizing monoclonal antibody specific for DNA polymerase LX (Coffman and Oglesby, unpublished). These data demonstrate the involvement of both polymerases in this in vitro system, most likely as part of a replication complex. A growing body of evidence indicates that such a complex, termed a replicon, replicates eukaryotic DNA in the same manner that a replicon containing DNA polymerases I and III replicates prokaryotic DNA ( 12, 13). Finally, the DNA content of these nuclei before and after incubation with the 30-50% AS fraction was quantitated by image analysis (14). Modal peak DNA values for the nuclei analyzed increased from 6.3 to 7.4 pg (Cohen, unpublished), demonstrating that DNA replication had initiated in those nuclei. This value is consistent with the expected incorporation under conditions of limiting dTTP (enough to replicate approximately 10% of the total DNA). Two lines of evidence indicate that the inhibitor works by inhibiting the initiation of DNA synthesis and not other replicative processes.First, the partially purified inhibitor has no effect on DNA polymerase LY activity. Second,the timecourse experiment shows that the inhibitor must be added to the activator prior to or simultaneously with the addition of nuclei for maximum effect, and very early in the incubation period to have much of an effect at all. Significant dTTP incorporation does not begin until 30 min after ADR addition. If the inhibitor is added at this point most of the incorporation is not inhibited. This result strongly supports two of the major premises of this study. First, ADR is a true initiator of DNA replication, and not simply a limiting part of the replicative machinery. Second, the inhibitor inhibits the initiation ofDNA synthesis and not elongation. The inhibitor is ineffective once replication has begun, and must inhibit ADR before ADR initiates replication at the various nuclear sites. The properties of the MOLT-4 inhibitor and the inhibitor found in quiescent lymphocytes parallels those of an inhibitor in the cytoplasm of senescentdiploid fibroblasts which inhibited S phaseentry but did not affect ongoing DNA synthesis(15-l 8).

The concentration-dependent incorporation maxima seen with the 30-50% AS fraction (Fig. 2) suggests that a stoichiometric relationship exists between the number of ADR moieties and the amount of initiation. If ADR functioned as a catalyst and could initiate DNA synthesis at multiple sites, then the timecourse data would show different incorporation rates leading to a single maxima, rather than different maxima, for different concentrations of ADR. If ADR functions by binding to a single initiation site (the simplest model), it could also function to prevent a second initiation at that site, thus acting to ensure the single duplication of the genome. Regardless of the underlying mechanism of ADR activity and its inhibition, the present study demonstrates that activating and inhibitory factors can coexist in a spontaneously proliferating transformed cell line. Since the regulation of cell proliferation is generally held to be dependent upon both positive and negative intracellular signals, these results suggest that failure to respond to the negative signal, rather than its absence may play an important role in certain proliferative disorders. This is consistent with our previous finding of nuclear unresponsiveness to exogenous lymphocytederived ADR inhibitor in several transformed cell lines. REFERENCES
