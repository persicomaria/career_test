Crystal Structure of 3,4-Dihydroxy-2-Butanone 4-Phosphate Synthase of Riboflavin Biosynthesis
Der-Ing Liao,*§ Joseph C. Calabrese,* Zdzislaw Wawrzak, Paul V. Viitanen,* and Douglas B. Jordan§ * DuPont Central Research and Development Experimental Station Wilmington, Delaware 19880  Northwestern University DND-CAT Synchrotron Research Center 9700 South Cass Avenue Argonne, Illinios 60439  DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company Experimental Station Route 141 and Henry Clay Road Wilmington, Delaware 19880 microorganisms, consists of seven distinct enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with GTP and ribulose 5-phosphate serving as the ultimate, non-committed precursors (Figure 1) [1]. Depending on the species origin, the enzymes catalyzing the two commitment steps are linked into a single polypeptide or constitute two separate proteins. L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DS) catalyzes the transformation of ribulose 5-phosphate to L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate (DHBP) and formate [2­9]. In the other branch of the pathway, four distinct enzyme-catalyzed steps lead to the generation of 4-ribitylamino-5-amino-2,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (RAADP) from GTP. Lumazine synthase (LS), the penultimate enzyme of riboflavin biosynthesis, catalyzes the condensation of DHBP with RAADP to yield orthophosphate and 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1 -D-ribityl)-lumazine (DMRL), the immediate precursor of riboflavin [10­13]. The terminal step of riboflavin biosynthesis is mediated by riboflavin synthase, which catalyzes the dismutation of two molecules of DMRL to yield riboflavin and RAADP [14­16]. Two equivalents of DHBP are incorporated into riboflavin for every one of RAADP. DS and the other enzymes of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway are attractive targets for antibiotic discovery efforts because humans are auxotrophic for riboflavin (vitamin B2) and obtain the substance through nutrition, whereas many human pathogens, particularly Gram negative bacteria and certain fungi, lack the capacity to obtain sufficient riboflavin from their host environment and must biosynthesize it. X-ray structures of LS have been determined for three sources (bacterial, plant, and fungal) [17­20] and they have been useful in the design of inhibitors [21, 22]. Until now, the threedimensional structure of DS has not been determined. In the seminal work of Volk and Bacher that revealed the DS-catalyzed reaction, the authors proposed a reaction path for DS that adheres to the results of their experiments using labeled substrates (Figure 2) [2­4]. The proposed course of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction involves enolization, ketonization, dehydration, skeleton rearrangement, and elimination steps, generating the view that the enzyme employs general acid and general base groups with a required metal cofactor to promote the formation of products. The skeletal rearrangement step is analogous to those in the reactions catalyzed by ketol-acid reductoisomerase [23­26] and 1-deoxyD-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase [27, 28]. The structure of the E. coli DS, reported here, will contribute to a better understanding of the chemical mechanisms directed by the catalyst and to a basis for designing poisons that inhibit its catalytic function in pathogens. Results and Discussion The three-dimensional crystal structure of DS was deter° mined at 2.4 A resolution by the multiwavelength anomaKey words: dihydroxybutanone phosphate synthase; riboflavin biosynthesis; skeletal rearrangement; antimicrobial target; structurebased design

Summary Background: 3,4-Dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase catalyzes a commitment step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin. On the enzyme, ribulose 5-phosphate is converted to 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate and formate in steps involving enolization, ketonization, dehydration, skeleton rearrangement, and formate elimination. The enzyme is absent in humans and an attractive target for the discovery of antimicrobials for pathogens incapable of acquiring sufficient riboflavin from their hosts. The homodimer of 23 kDa subunits requires Mg2 for activity. Results: The first three-dimensional structure of the en° zyme was determined at 1.4 A resolution using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method on Escherichia coli protein crystals containing gold. The protein consists of an fold having a complex linkage of strands. Intersubunit contacts are mediated by numerous hydrophobic interactions and three hydrogen bond networks. Conclusions: A proposed active site was identified on the basis of amino acid residues that are conserved among the enzyme from 19 species. There are two wellseparated active sites per dimer, each of which comprise residues from both subunits. In addition to three arginines and two threonines, which may be used for recognizing the phosphate group of the substrate, the active site consists of three glutamates, two aspartates, two histidines, and a cysteine which may provide the means for general acid and base catalysis and for coordinating the Mg2 cofactor within the active site.

lous diffraction (MAD) method using crystals soaked in Au(CN)2 (Table 1). There are two gold atoms per asymmetric unit (see Materials and Methods).The model was ° refined to 1.55 A resolution (Table 2). A data set for the ° native enzyme was refined to 1.4 A resolution with a crystallographic R factor of 18.0% and a Rfree [29] of 22.1%. There was no electron density for formate (a product of the DS-catalyzed reaction) in either structure, even though the formate concentration was 3 or 6 M in the crystallization media. As there is no additional information of structural significance found in the model derived from the gold derivative, the higher resolution structure of the native enzyme will be discussed below. The asymmetric unit contains two monomers related by a noncrystallographic, 2-fold symmetry. The homodimer observed in the crystal structure is the form of the enzyme found in solution [8]. The DS gene encodes 217 amino acids. The model includes residues 5­213, except for 34­37 in one monomer (molecule A) and residues 4­217, except for 34­38 in the other monomer (molecule B). The Overall Structure The homodimeric DS is a protein with the N and C termini of each monomer on the far ends of the dimer, away from the dimer interface (Figure 3a). Each monomer consists of 10 helices on either side of the central eight-stranded mixed sheet which twists nearly 180 from end to end (Figures 3b, 3c). The leftmost strand

( 4) is very short and distorted. Connectivity of the mixed sheet is complex and rather unusual (Figure 3c). It contains three crossovers connecting the C-terminal end of 2 to the N-terminal end of 3, the C-terminal end of 3 to the N-terminal end of 4, and the C-terminal end of 7 to the N-terminal end of 8. Each of the crossovers has a single helix of two or three turns and two tight turns of two to four residues, the latter of which connects the helix to the strands. The three helices of the crossovers are packed on the same side of the sheet. The C-terminal end of 4 and the N-terminal end of 5 are connected by a small shaped loop ( 1) of 11 residues (83­93) that has no secondary structure. The 1 loops of the two monomers have relatively high ° ° temperature factors (34.9 A2 and 48.7 A2 for the loops of molecules A and B, respectively) in comparison to the ° ° average B factors (17.1 A2 and 20.5 A2 for the molecules A and B, respectively). As well, the 1 loops do not conform to the noncrystallographic, 2-fold symmetry of the rest of the structure. The C-terminal end of 5 and the N-terminal end of 6 are linked by an -shaped loop of 35 residues (101­135) that contains a four-turn helix (residues 111­122) in the middle of the loop followed by a 310 helix (129­131). The loop that connects the C-terminal end of 6 to the N-terminal end of 7 is also shaped ( 2) with 28 residues (143­170). 2 contains a 310 helix (147­150) followed by a three-turn helix (residues 154­164). The red circle of Figure 3c shows the topological position of a conserved cluster of acidic residues (Glu-40, Asp-42, Glu-174) which is likely a binding site for Mg2 , the divalent cation required for catalysis (see Sequence Comparisons and Location of the Active Site). The loop (residues 34­39), connecting the adjacent 1 and 2 strands next to the proposed cation binding site, is disordered and cannot be seen in the electron density map. This loop contains two of the conserved residues (Arg-37 and Glu-38) that may have catalytic roles (see Sequence Comparisons and Location of the Active Site). Sequence Comparisons and Location of the Active Site A comparison of DS amino acid sequences from 19 species indicates that 22 residues are strictly conserved

and that the residues are dispersed throughout the primary structure of the E. coli enzyme (Table 3). In three dimensions, however, the conserved residues are localized on one side of the monomer being near or within the dimer interface (Figure 4). The conserved residues may be grouped into those with structural roles and those with potential roles in the catalytic cycle. A summary of the locations of the strictly conserved residues in the three dimensional structure as well as their inferred roles are listed in Table 3. Among the conserved residues with clear structural roles are five glycines which are needed for torsion angles and/or size requirements. The cis proline (Pro-134) is required for making the cross of the loop. Ser-110 is needed for helix stabilization. The side chain Ala-111 can be no larger or smaller for stabilizing the dimer interface with hydrophobic interactions. The remaining 14 conserved residues are candidates for participation in catalysis. By analogy to the active site of ketol-acid reductoisomerase [25, 26], it is expected to find some acidic residues for chelation of the divalent metal cofactor. The active site of ketol-acid reductoisomerase has five acidic residues, four of which interact directly or indirectly (through a water molecule) with its two divalent metal ions. Among the conserved DS residues there are seven acidic residues, which may suggest that more than one Mg2 cofactor is required for catalysis. Three of these (Glu-40, Asp-42, and Glu174) form a cluster of side chains and are likely a chela-

tion site for Mg2 cofactor(s). The three other acidic residues appear to be either too far away for direct participation in catalysis (Asp-33), involved in stabilizing the side chain of Arg-150 (Glu-155), or belong to the disordered loop (Glu-38). Catalysis of enolization and dehydration steps is likely mediated by amino acid side chains that function as a general acid/base. There are two conserved histidine residues: His-153 has van der Waals contacts with the cluster of acidic residues of the same monomer and His-136 comes from the adjacent monomer of the dimer and forms a water-mediated H bond with the side chain of Glu-174 of the acidic cluster. The proximity of the two histidine residues to the cluster of acidic residues suggests that one or both of them is involved in catalysis, likely serving as general acid/base. The thiol of Cys-67 is another candidate for participation in catalysis as a ° general acid/base. The side chain resides 6 A away from the cluster of acidic residues. Cys-67 is likely the residue that is modified, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity, by the numerous, thiol-reactive compounds found in high throughput screening of the enzyme (D. Jordan, unpublished data). The solvent-accessible surface area ° of the thiol group is much greater for Cys-67 (9.7 A2 and ° 8.5 A2 for molecules A and B, respectively) than that of the other Cys residues of DS (for both molecules A and ° ° ° B: Cys-69, 0 A2; Cys-173, 0 A2; and Cys-188, 0.4 A2). Monophosphate groups of substrates are frequently recognized by enzymes with the side chains of Arg and

The connectivity of the strands, helices (cyan circles) and 310 helices (yellow circles) are shown. The starting and ending residues for each strand are as follows: 1, 27­32; 2, 40­46; 3, 65­69; 4, 80­82; 5,94­100; 6, 134­142; 7, 171­174; 8, 197­201. The dotted line indicates the disordered residues. The red circle is the position of the cluster of acidic residues.

Ser or Thr residues. DS has three conserved Arg residues, two Thr, and one Ser. Two Arg residues surround the proposed Mg2 binding site: one (Arg-150) from the same monomer and the other (Arg-114) from the adja° cent monomer. Both are about 8 A from the proposed binding site of the divalent cation. The orientation of the guanidinium group, in both cases, is fixed by hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. It is possible that one of them has a role in stabilizing the phosphate group of the substrate. The third conserved Arg (Arg-37) is in the disordered loop. Phosphate recognition could be mediated by the side chains of Thr-107 and/or Thr-154, which are in the vicinity of the cluster of acidic residues, but likely not by Ser-110 whose side chain is occupied in H bond formation in stabilizing an helix. Although we have no structural information for the conserved Arg37 and Glu-38 residues that reside within the disordered loop, their proximity in the amino acid sequence to Glu40 and Asp-42 of the cluster of acidic residues suggests that they have roles in catalysis or substrate recognition.

A view of the proposed active site of DS is shown in Figure 5. The surface electrostatic potential in the region around the proposed active site is particularly negative in charge (Figure 6). The Dimer Interface The majority of the interactions between the two monomers in the dimer interface are hydrophobic. Although the residues involved in the hydrophobic interactions (E. coli residues Ile-65, Met-83, Val-84, Phe-95, Val-97, and Phe-138) are not strictly conserved, they are always hydrophobic among the DS enzymes from different species. Three residues that form electrostatic interactions between the monomers are strictly conserved (Table 3). They are Thr-107, which forms a water-mediated H bond to the Glu-40 of the adjacent monomer; Arg-114, which has hydrogen bonding interactions with the main chain carbonyl of Ser-63 and Gly-64 of the adjacent monomer; and His-136, which forms a water-mediated H bond to Glu-174 of the adjacent monomer.

Conserved residues were determined from the identical residues in the sequence alignments of DS proteins from 19 species: Aquifex aeolicus, Bacillus subtilis, Campylobacter jejuni, Chlamydia muridarum, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Deinococcus radiodurans, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobactor pylori, Magnapothe grisea, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitidis, Photobacterium leiognathi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Synechocystis sp., Thermotoga maritima, and Vibrio harveyi.

residues are in the vicinity of the proposed Mg2 binding site and two of them, Thr-107 and His-136, have side chain-interactions with the cluster of acidic residues. As described above, it is likely that the dimer interface contains a part of the active site (residues Thr-107, Arg117, His-136, and Glu-174). Biological Implications The enzyme cofactors derived from riboflavin have long been of considerable interest to chemists and biochemists in understanding their diverse catalytic roles. The

enzymes that mediate the biosynthesis of riboflavin are interesting in themselves because of the chemically diverse and, in some cases, chemically difficult reactions catalyzed. The reactions promoted by DS serve as an example of chemically diverse and difficult reactions within a single biosynthetic step. It is no wonder that DS activity is rate limiting for the production of riboflavin under certain conditions [9]. DS has a relatively low value for kcat ( 0.1 s 1) among enzymes, thus underscoring the difficulty of the chemical reactions mediated by the catalyst.

Figure 4. Stereo View of the Residues Conserved among DS Enzymes from 19 Species The orientation of the DS monomer is the same as that of molecule A in Figure 3a. The figure was generated using RIBBONS [38].

Even though the active site of DS is not fully defined by this work, the structure will likely lead the way to determinations of structures of the enzyme complexed with active-site ligands including its divalent metal cofactor. NMR analysis of the protein is underway [8]. Ultimately, there will be sufficient structural and biochemical information to formulate a detailed mechanism for catalysis of this mechanistically interesting enzyme. Applied efforts may use the structural information for the design of new catalysts having altered substrate specificities and inhibitors of DS function in pests such as weeds and pathogens of humans, animals, and crops.
Experimental Procedures Crystallization PCR amplification of the E. coli DS gene, ligation into pET24d ( ), production of the protein in E. coli, and purification of highly catalytically-active DS are described [30]. DS was crystallized at room temperature from hanging drops using the vapor diffusion method. Crystals appear in 4 to 5 days from a protein solution containing 24 mg/ml DS in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and a precipitating well solution containing 3 M CsCl, 3 M Cs(formate), 20 mM Bis-Tris-propaneNaOH (pH 6.9) (condition 1) or 6 M sodium formate, 25 mM HEPESNaOH (pH 7.0) (condition 2). The optimum protein to well ratio in the drop was 2.2 l protein to 0.7 l well solution. The crystal used for collecting MAD data was obtained from condition 2. It was soaked overnight with 1.5 mM Au(CN)2 in the crystallization solution. The crystal used for collecting the native data set was obtained from

condition 1. Prior to data collection the crystals were briefly washed in a solution containing 6.8 M sodium formate and 5% glycerol in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0). Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement Data on the gold derivative were collected at the DND CAT of the Advanced Photon Source using a 135 mm MAR CCD camera at a distance of 80 mm with 1 oscillations and an exposure time of 8 s. Crystals were mounted on nylon loops with the diameter of 0.2­0.3 mm and directly frozen in the ­180 C cold stream. A five-wavelength MAD data set was collected using an inverted beam geometry at wavelengths selected on the basis of an Au fluorescence scan. Continuous frames (105) were collected in a single pass for each Bijvoet pair at each wavelength. The high resolution, native data set was collected at a single wavelength in the same manner, but with the longer exposure time of 15 s. The gold-derivative and native data sets were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK [31]. The structure was solved by using the MAD method [32]. The positions of the two gold atoms were obtained by Bijvoet difference direct methods (SHELX97) [33]. The phasing was solved using SHARP [34]. To save computation time, the resolution of the data ° was limited to 2.4 A for the phase determination. The resulting phases were used to generate an initial map which was sharpened by using a solvent flattening program [35]. The initial models were constructed on a Silicon Graphics system using the program O [36]. ° The gold-derivative and native structures were refined at 1.55 A and ° 1.4 A resolution, respectively, using the program TNT [37]. The final model of the high resolution, native structure contains 205 residues in one monomer (molecule A), 209 residues in the other (molecule B), four Cs atoms and 437 water molecules. None of the Cs atoms
