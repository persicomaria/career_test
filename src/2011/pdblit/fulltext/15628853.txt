ABSTRACT: Tuberculosis (TB) is the primary cause of mortality among infectious diseases. Mycobacterium tuberculosis thymidylate kinase (TMPKMtub) catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of deoxythymidine 5-monophosphate (dTMP). Essential to DNA replication, this enzyme represents a promising target for developing new drugs against TB, because the configuration of its active site is unique within the TMPK family. Indeed, it has been proposed that, as opposed to other TMPKs, catalysis by TMPKMtub necessitates the transient binding of a magnesium ion coordinating the phosphate acceptor. Moreover, 3-azidodeoxythymidine monophosphate (AZTMP) is a competitive inhibitor of TMPKMtub, whereas it is a substrate for human and other TMPKs. Here, the crystal structures of TMPKMtub in complex with deoxythymidine (dT) and AZTMP were determined to 2.1 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively, and suggest a mechanism for inhibition. The azido group of AZTMP perturbs the induced-fit mechanism normally adopted by the enzyme. Magnesium is prevented from binding, and the resulting electrostatic environment precludes phosphoryl transfer from occurring. Our data provide a model for drug development against tuberculosis.

Tuberculosis is a major disease of mankind, claiming more than 2 million lives annually (1). One of the most significant risk factors for developing TB is infection by the human immunodeficiency acquired virus (HIV).1 Moreover, TB is the most likely cause of death for HIV-positive people. Because of the appearance of multiresistant strains (2) and the lack of an effective vaccine, the quest for new drugs against TB has become a priority. Thymidylate kinase (TMPK, EC 2.7.4.9, ATP:TMP phosphotransferase) belongs to the nucleoside monophosphate kinase (NMPK) family and catalyzes the reversible phos This work was supported by grants from the Institut Pasteur, the Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, and the Centre ´ ´ National de la Recherche Scientifique.

phorylation of dTMP to deoxythymidine 5-diphosphate (dTDP) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Situated at the junction of the de noVo and salvage pathways for the synthesis of deoxythymidine 5-triphosphate (dTTP), TMPK is the last specific enzyme in these pathways, therefore being essential for cell growth and survival. TMPKs are homodimers, each monomer being composed of eight to nine R-helices surrounding a five-stranded -sheet core. Two essential structural features of all TMPKs are a phosphate binding loop (P-loop) at the N-terminus that includes a strictly conserved aspartate (or glutamate) residue and the LID region, a highly flexible stretch of residues covering the phosphate donor binding site at the C-terminus (3, 4). The enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a particularly valuable target for the development of new therapies against TB because it uses a catalytic mechanism unique within the TMPK family. Indeed, a combined analysis of several X-ray structures of the enzyme indicates that, as opposed to other known TMPKs, phosphate transfer in TMPKMtub requires the transient binding of a magnesium ion coordinating the phosphate acceptor (5-8). For example, it was shown that the presence of a metal ion in the dTMP binding site correlates with the observation of a catalytic activity of the crystalline enzyme (6, 7). Magnesium compensates for a missing positively charged residue (Arg45 in the human enzyme is replaced with Tyr39 in TMPKMtub) and plays a key role in neutralizing the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic substrates.

Structure of M. tuberculosis TMPK in Complex with AZTMP group of dTMP, adopting a C2-endo conformation in the active site, participates in metal stabilization through interactions involving a central water molecule (Wat141) and Asp9, the conserved acidic residue of the P-loop. Hence, this group has been highlighted as a target of election for the design of inhibitors against the enzyme (6, 8). Solution studies have revealed that some dTMP analogues substituted at position 3 or 2 of the ribose moiety and/or at position 5 of the thymine ring inhibit the enzyme with Ki values in the range of 5-50 µM (9-11). In particular, AZTMP inhibits TMPKMtub in a competitive manner at the phosphate acceptor site with a Ki of 10 µM (9). Interestingly, some nonphosphorylated thymidine analogues, two of which are dT and 3azido-3-deoxythymidine (AZT), also inhibit the enzyme (12-14). The case of AZTMP is particularly relevant since this molecule is a substrate for almost all TMPK enzymes studied so far (15-18). The rate of phosphorylation by the Escherichia coli enzyme is only 2-fold lower for AZTMP than it is for dTMP. The human enzyme participates in the activation pathway of the anti-HIV pro-drug AZT, but phosphorylates AZTMP only at a low rate, creating a bottleneck in this pathway (19) that contributes to the toxicity and limited efficacy of AZT therapy. The difference in the efficiency of AZTMP phosphorylation between eukaryotic and prokaryotic TMPKs has been correlated to subtle variations in the interaction of the azido moiety with the conserved aspartate or glutamate in the P-loop (16). The striking difference in the behavior of TMPKMtub toward AZTMP compared to that of other TMPKs should now be addressed in view of the peculiar mechanism adopted by the M. tuberculosis enzyme. In this work, we determined the crystal structures of TMPKMtub in complex with AZTMP and dT to 2.0 and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively. The results provide structural evidence that AZTMP inhibits TMPKMtub through a simple mechanism: the presence of the azido moiety prevents the binding of the Mg2+ ion essential to catalysis. This finding may serve as a basis for the rational design of drugs against TB. Furthermore, the structure of the TMPKMtub-AZTMP complex reveals that AZTMP may also bind in the ATP active site, consistent with the substrate inhibition mechanism contributing to AZT toxicity suggested for the human enzyme (19). MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization Conditions. TMPKMtub was overexpressed, purified (9), and cocrystallized with dT and magnesium acetate, using sodium malonate as a precipitant (6). Cocrystallization trials with dT using ammonium sulfate as a precipitant, which normally yields crystals with higher diffraction power, failed, which we attribute to the fact that ammonium sulfate forces crystallization in an intermediatelike state of the enzyme that can only form in the presence of dTMP (6, 8). Crystals of the TMPKMtub-AZTMP complex were obtained by soaking TMPKMtub-dT crystals at room temperature for 45 min in a solution containing 14 mM AZTMP, 1.4 M sodium malonate, 2% PEG 2000, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0), 2 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 25 mM magnesium acetate. All crystals were flash-cooled to 100 K for data collection, after being soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (6).

X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination. Diffraction data were collected on beamline ID-14 at ESRF (Grenoble, France) and processed with Mosflm (20). Data collection statistics, refinement statistics, and geometry analysis are given in Table 1. Crystals belong to space group P3121 with the following mean cell dimensions: 64.2, 64.2, and 195.4 Å. The asymmetric unit accommodates the functional dimer, with a solvent content of 45%. The slightly lower quality of the data set from the TMPKMtub-AZTMP complex was attributed to a significant anisotropy of the diffraction power throughout the reciprocal space, resulting in a less than optimal completeness and in higher crystallographic R-factors. Models of TMPKMtub were refined with CNS (21) using bulk solvent correction and a maximum likelihood target function. Rigid body refinement was followed by standard cycles of conjugate gradient minimization and manual model building using O (22). The occupancy of AZTMP in the phosphate donor site (monomer A) was estimated to be 65%. An acetate ion was found in the ATP site with occupancies of 35% (monomer A of the TMPKMtub-AZTMP structure) and 100% (monomer B of the TMPKMtub-AZTMP structure and both monomers of the TMPKMtub-dT structure). RESULTS Crystalline TMPKMtub has previously been shown to be catalytically competent if sodium malonate is used as a precipitating agent (6). The X-ray structure of the enzyme crystallized with this agent and in complex with its natural substrate dTMP [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1N5K] is shown in Figure 1. For clarity, we recall hereafter the essential features of this structure (6). In the crystal, the two monomers (termed A and B) undergo a different degree of conformational flexibility, particularly in the LID region. In

the presence of dTMP, monomer A is in a "semi-open" state with a large part of the LID being disordered. The structure of this monomer provides a picture of the first step along the reaction pathway, the binding of dTMP (Figures 1A and 2A). The substrate is "sensed" by interactions linking its 3-

OH group with Asp163, via the essential water molecule Wat141. A Mg2+ ion is not observed in monomer A, since at this early stage of the reaction the semi-open state of the enzyme prevents metal stabilization. In contrast, the active site of monomer B is found in a "semi-closed" state, due to

more prominent lattice contacts. The corresponding structure has been proposed to be representative of the second step along the reaction pathway, the binding of magnesium (Figures 1B and 2B) (6). In this monomer, the LID is mostly organized as an R-helix, favoring the stabilization of the conserved P-loop residue Asp9 and leading to metal binding. The structures of TMPKMtub in complex with either dT or AZTMP reveal no major conformational rearrangement as compared to the structure of the TMPKMtub-dTMP complex (overall root-mean-square deviations from the latter structure, excluding water molecules, of 0.6 and 0.4 Å, respectively). However, subtle structural changes occur in the enzyme active site. TMPKMtub-dT Complex at 2.1 Å Resolution. In this structure, in both monomers A and B, Wat141 is maintained through tight hydrogen bonds to Asp163 and to the 3-OH group of dT, despite the absence of an R-phosphate group (Figure 3). In monomer B, the Mg2+ ion and two of its coordinating water molecules (Wat143 and Wat153), normally bound when dTMP is present, are no longer observed

due to the loss of two contacts normally mediated by the R-phosphate group of dTMP (Figure 3C,D). In this monomer, Asp9 remains ordered and, as in the case of the TMPKMtubdTMP complex, interacts with the 3-OH group of the substrate, Tyr103, and, weakly, with Arg95 and Wat141. TMPKMtub-AZTMP Complex at 2.0 Å Resolution. Crystals of the TMPKMtub-AZTMP complex could only be obtained in soaking experiments, by displacing dT rather than dTMP from the active site. We assign this finding to the fact that the modest difference in the affinity for the enzyme of dT (Ki ) 27 µM) and dTMP (Km ) 4.5 µM) found in solution (12) is probably greatly enhanced in the crystalline state. A key advantage of this experimental protocol was that the observation in electron density maps of a phosphate group in the acceptor site proved unambiguously the occurrence of AZTMP binding even when the azido group could not be easily distinguished from the 3-OH group of the natural substrate. In monomer A, the azido group of AZTMP is well ordered and takes the place of Wat141, which is prevented from

binding and cannot stabilize Asp163 (Figure 4A,B). The "anchoring" of Asp163 on dTMP, proposed to be the first step on the reaction pathway, promoting LID closure and Mg2+ binding, is therefore not possible in the presence of AZTMP. Disordering of Tyr165, normally covering the ribose moiety of the substrate, follows the destabilization of Asp163. In addition, the azido group establishes direct interactions with Asp9 (Figure 4A,B). This residue, whose side chain normally remains disordered until LID closure,

is therefore prematurely and inadequately positioned so that it also interacts directly with the R-phosphate group. Interestingly, in monomer A, a second AZTMP molecule is observed in the phosphoryl donor binding site (Figure 5), probably favored by the large accessibility of this site when the LID is open. Although the azido group is mostly disordered and could not be modeled, the base and ribose moieties are clearly identified in the electron density and interact with the protein through van der Waals contacts and

Structure of M. tuberculosis TMPK in Complex with AZTMP one hydrogen bond between the side chain of Thr15 and the O4 atom of the base. The R-phosphate group is found at a position putatively occupied by the -phosphate of ATP (5), interacting with the P-loop main chain, the side chain of Lys13, and a water molecule. Nevertheless, the overall geometry of the ATP binding site is not significantly altered, and no change in the positioning of the P-loop can be noticed at the resolution of our data. In monomer B, neither Wat141 nor a magnesium ion is observed in the presence of AZTMP (Figure 4C,D). Asp163, Tyr165, and Glu166 are observed at the same positions as in the TMPKMtub-dTMP complex but display higher Bfactors. These residues are brought into position, but only loosely, by partial LID closure imposed by lattice contacts. Only the N3 atom of the azido group could be modeled in this monomer, suggesting several conformations of this group that might be induced by the nearby, conflicting presence of Asp163 and Tyr165. A swing of Asp9 to a second, partially occupied conformation corroborates this finding (Figure 4C,D). This second conformation is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to Ser150 and to a water molecule. DISCUSSION Chemotherapy of virus infection is often based on derivatives of natural nucleosides (23), which, once triphosphorylated by intracellular kinases, target viral polymerases and abolish DNA synthesis. In contrast, common antibacterial drugs are rarely related to such compounds. Our work provides structural evidence that 3-azido-substituted dTMP may serve as a potential lead for new anti-mycobacterial drugs targeting thymidylate kinase. A specific inhibition mechanism by AZTMP is revealed, which radically differs from the (pro-drug) activation mechanisms observed in the human (24, 25), yeast (26), or E. coli (16) enzymes. AZTMP inhibits TMPKMtub by excluding a Mg2+ ion, normally binding to the dTMP active site. We propose the following inhibition mechanism, sketched in Figure 6. Transient binding of magnesium to TMPKMtub has been suggested to be promoted by partial LID closure initially prompted by a crucial water-mediated interaction between the 3-OH group of dTMP and Asp163 (6). In the presence of AZTMP, the mediating Wat141 is prevented from binding. The interaction with Asp163 may therefore not take place, and the LID may not properly close. Without an appropriate steric and nucleophilic environment, normally provided by LID closure (in particular Glu166) and by the R-phosphate group of the substrate, a Mg2+ ion cannot be stabilized. Under these conditions, Arg95, the only positively charged residue interacting with the acceptor phosphate, is insufficient to neutralize electrostatic repulsion between the two anionic substrates. In addition, in the presence of AZTMP, the conserved P-loop residue Asp9 interacts with the azido group and is locked in a catalytically incompetent position. This further strengthens the inhibitory effect of AZTMP. The mechanism of inhibition by AZTMP probably results from the inversion of the hydrogen bond capability of the 3-azido substituent in this molecule versus the 3-OH group in dTMP. A hydrogen bond donor at the 3-position promotes stabilization of Wat141, which itself donates H-bonds to Asp163 and to one of the phosphate oxygens, favoring LID closure, stabilization of Asp9, and Mg2+ coordination.

FIGURE 6: (A) Sketch of the proposed inhibition mechanism of TMPKMtub by AZTMP. The normal induced-fit mechanism triggered by dTMP binding and leading to Mg2+ coordination and phosphoryl transfer (left) is compared with the stalling of this mechanism when AZTMP is present (right).

contrast, a hydrogen bond acceptor destabilizes this water molecule and prevents LID closure. The structure of the TMPKMtub-AZTMP complex in monomer A in fact closely resembles the structure of the apoenzyme (6), in which a major fraction of the LID as well as some extra residues at the C-terminus of the region, including Asp163 and Tyr165, are largely disordered. This suggests that the enzyme is unable to properly "sense" AZTMP, and that the induced-

136 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 1, 2005 fit mechanism necessary for binding Mg2+ and leading to catalysis may not occur in its presence. Assessment of the nature of the interactions established by the azido group within the active site is complicated by the presence of several resonant forms of this entity, involving significant charge displacement. Nevertheless, the interaction with Asp9 probably results from long H-bonding between the carboxyl group of this residue and the N3 or N5 atom of AZTMP in a manner similar to what has been postulated in the case of binding to DNA (27). Such interaction, however, requires Asp9 to be protonated at the used pH. This is likely to be the case since the local electronegative environment, normally favoring Mg2+ binding, is expected to promote the recruitment of protons in the absence of the metal, increasing the local pKa of Asp9. An additional interaction of an electrostatic nature between a deprotonated Asp9 and atom N4 or even N5 (28) carrying formal positive charges is also possible. We propose that the "open" configuration of the phosphate acceptor site of the TMPKMtub-AZTMP complex, as observed in monomer A (Figure 4A,B), represents the structure of the inhibited enzyme (Figure 6C). In this open state, the 3-azido group has only one partner, Asp9, with which to interact, and is stabilized in such a way that electron density for this group is clearly visible. In the case of monomer B, when the active site is forced to partially close due to crystal contacts (rather than due to the normal induced-fit mechanism which is arrested), the azido group interacts in a conflicting manner with several partners (Asp9, Asp163, and Tyr165), probably explaining the multiple conformations that are observed. The inhibition of TMPKMtub by thymidine, which has a 3-OH group but no R-phosphate, also results from the impossibility of magnesium binding. However, in this case, the mechanism of magnesium exclusion has an origin different from the one described above for AZTMP. Our data suggest that TMPKMtub senses thymidine correctly, as Wat141, together with Asp9, Asp163, and Tyr165, is observed in the density maps as clearly as when the natural substrate is bound. Therefore, LID closure can take place. However, a Mg2+ ion does not bind to the complex because in addition to LID closure, the presence of a negatively charged phosphate group is also required for metal binding. Therefore, it is not surprising that dT has also been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of TMPKMtub (12). Finally, the AZTMP molecule found in the ATP binding site of the open enzyme (Figure 5) suggests a competitive inhibition of TMPKMtub by AZTMP binding to the ATP site. Such inhibition was not observed in solution studies at submillimolar concentrations of AZTMP (not shown) and is difficult to measure at the much larger concentration (14 mM) used in the crystallographic experiment because of saturation at the phosphate acceptor site. However, it has been shown to occur in yeast with a Ki of 30 µM (19). This finding is also fully consistent with the inhibition mechanism proposed for the human enzyme, where AZTMP accumulating to a millimolar level in human cells during AZT treatment would bind to the ATP site, thus contributing to the toxicity of the pro-drug (19). In conclusion, our data pinpoint the need for binding a Mg2+ ion during catalysis as the "Achilles' heel" of M. tuberculosis thymidylate kinase. 3-OH dTMP substituents

Fioravanti et al. which are not H-bond donors, such as AZTMP, can prevent the formation of a net of interactions linking a central water molecule (Wat141), the phosphate acceptor, the LID region, the P-loop, and in turn the metal ion, causing the inducedfit mechanism employed by the enzyme to stall. Although a protective effect of AZT therapy against TB has been suggested in an epidemiological study (29), no bactericidal activity of AZT against M. tuberculosis cells has been detected in Vitro (30). Whether AZT may penetrate the lipid-rich mycobacterial cell wall despite the presence of porin channels (31, 32) remains to be assessed. Even if AZT could enter mycobacteria, AZTMP would not form due to the lack of a deoxythymidine kinase (33). However, since the affinities of several dT analogues for TMPKMtub are similar to those of their phosphorylated congeners (12, 13), AZT derivatives, possibly modified at the 5-position, may be rationally designed on the basis of our results to inhibit the enzyme and act as potent anti-tuberculosis agents.
