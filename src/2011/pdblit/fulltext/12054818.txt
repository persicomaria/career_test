Significance
For the vancomycin group of antibiotics, there is likely to be an intrinsic upper limit for their binding affinities to cell-wall analogues [8,11]. In the case of strongly binding II-alnnine (D-Ala) terminating ligands this limit is like11

to be approached in solution, so there through the addition of extra interactions

however, there is a greater potential to gain binding affinity through cooperative enhancements such as templating. Thus, there is an enhancement of over 250-fold for Dot-Hexa-Lac (2.5 x 10S %I-` over the weak binding ) that binding of Ac-Tri-Lac (920 M-l), d emonstrating can increase significantly for peptides longer than three residues. Care must be taken to distinguish between the enhancement fi-om templating and from other effects. For example, the increase in affinity- from Ac-Tri-Lac to Ac-Tetra-Lac is a result of the addition of the glutamate residue. It is unlikely that further residues will affect the binding in free solution to the same degree because the) do not interact significantly with the antibiotic [231.

derivatives of CE have been developed Recently, bearing hydrophobic groups on the 4-epi-vancosamine on the residue-4 disaccharide [25], and these hydrophobic groups have been shown to act as membrane anchors [8,26]. These derivatised antibiotics show significant activit\- against vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteria [26,27] through strengthened binding on the bacterial surface [8,26], although any increase in activity against vancomycin-sensitive bacteria is less marked [27]. In combination with our previous work [8,9], the illustration here of the greater cooperative

A sample of TfOH in water was used as an external reference (in a glass insert in the NMR tube) for both chemical shift and relative peak integrals. The TfOH concentration used (- 1 x 1 0m4 Mm' was such that its ) corresponding other peak in the lgF spectrum to be observed. was of similar intensity integral to the lgF resonances The relative of the TfOH

peak was calibrated from a spectrum of TFAc-Tri-Ala of known concentration containing this TfOH insert. In order to adjust for the loss of any 19F signal from TFAc-Trl-Ala due to non-specific bmdlng of TFAc-Tn-Ala to the vesicle/ligand complex, an experiment was performed In which TFAc-Trl-Ala solution was titrated Into a solution of ligand and vesicles (ie., In the absence of antibiotic). Any such loss of lgF signal was below the limits of observation, however (~4%). This control was performed for each different llgand examined. Experiments demonstrating the nonassociation of CE for vesicles has previously been published [al.
