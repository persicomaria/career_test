Caspases are cysteine proteases that are essential during the initiation and execution of apoptosis and inflammation. The formation of large oligomeric protein complexes is critical to the activation of caspases in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways. These oligomeric protein complexes function as a platform to recruit caspases, which leads to caspase activation via a proximity-induced mechanism. One well-known oligomeric caspase-activating complex is the PIDDosome for caspase-2 activation, which is composed of 3 protein components, PIDD, RAIDD and Caspase-2. Despite the significant role that caspase-2 activated by PIDDosome plays during genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis, the oligomerization mechanism and the method by which the caspase-activating process is mediated by the formation of PIDDosome is currently not well understood. Here, we show that the assembly mechanism of the core of PIDDosome is time-dependent and salt concentration-dependent. In addition, we demonstrate that point mutations on RAIDD (R147E) and on PIDD (Y814A) exert a dominant negative effect on the formation of the PIDDosome, and that this effect cannot be applied after the PIDDosome has been formed.

1. Introduction Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms that is critical for tissue homeostasis, embryonic development, and immune cell regulation [1­4]. However, a malfunction of apoptosis can cause serious human diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity [5­8]. This important process is mediated by the sequential activation of caspases, which are cysteine proteases that cleave proteins specifically after aspartic acid residues [9,10]. Caspases can be classified into two groups according to their sequence of activation, initiator caspases such as caspases-2, 8, 9 and 10, and effector caspases such as caspases-3 and 7 [11,12]. Initiator caspases, which have N-terminal pro-domains for the formation of caspase-activating complexes, are activated by a proximity-induced mechanism. Conversely, effector caspases are activated by initiator caspases. Oligomeric initiator caspase-activating complexes function as a platform to recruit caspases, providing proximity for self-activation [9,11,13­15]. Well-known initiator caspase-activating complexes include 1) DISC (Death Inducing Signaling Complex), which activates Caspases-8 and 10 [16,17], 2) Apoptosome, which activates Caspase-9 [18,19], 3) Inflammasome,

which activates Caspase-1 [20­22], and 4) PIDDosome, which activates Caspase-2 [23­26]. PIDD [27,28], RAIDD [29,30] and caspase-2 [26] are three protein components that form the most recently identified caspase-activating complex, PIDDosome. PIDD contains 910 residues with seven leucine rich repeats (LRRs), two ZU-5 domains and a C-terminal Death Domain (DD). PIDD is essential for cell death, which it facilitates by activating caspase-2. In addition, PIDD is also critical for cell survival due to its interaction with RIP1, a kinase that has been implicated in the activation of NF-B [31,32]. The results of several studies indicate that PIDD may be a molecular switch that controls the balance between life and death upon genotoxic stress [32]. RAIDD is an adapter protein containing Caspase Recruiting Domain (CARD) at the N-terminus and a DD domain at the C-terminus. Caspase-2 is the second caspase to be identified and is the most evolutionarily conserved caspase cross the species of animal [33­35]. Despite this, due to the lack of a distinct phenotype in knock-out mice there has been little interest in this caspase. However, identification of the PIDDosome as a caspase-2 activating complex, as well as additional studies that have shown that caspase-2 acts upstream of the mitochondrial pathway in response to genotoxic stress to induce caspase-2 mediated apoptosis, has renewed interest in this field [34]. Caspase-2 possesses the CARD domain at its N-terminus. The assembly of PIDDosome is totally dependent on the protein­ protein interacting module known as the death-domain superfamily, which is comprised of 4 subfamilies, Death Domain (DD), Death

Effector Domain (DED), Caspase-Recruitment Domain (CARD), and Pyrin Domain (PYD) [4,36]. PIDDosome is assembled via a DD:DD interaction between RAIDD and PIDD and a CARD:CARD interaction between RAIDD and caspase-2 [26]. The PIDD DD:RAIDD DD complex forms the core oligomeric platform in the PIDDosome, while the RAIDD CARD:caspase-2 CARD interaction is responsible for caspase-2 recruitment. The molecular structure of the core portion of the PIDDosome formed by RAIDD DD and PIDD DD was recently elucidated [37]. Although the description of the structure of PIDDosome provided vast information enabling a better understanding of its oligomerization mechanism, there is still little biochemical information regarding its assembly mechanism. In this biochemical study, we showed that the formation of the core of PIDDosome is dependent on time and salt concentration. We also found that two mutations generated during structural-based mutagenesis studies, R147E on RAIDD DD and Y814A on PIDD DD, are dominant negative mutations that inhibit complex formation in the presence of wild-types. Interestingly, those dominant negative effects are abolished after the PIDDosome core portions are pre-formed. The discovery of dominant negative mutants R147E on RAIDD and Y814A on PIDD in this study that might inhibit genotoxic stressinduced apoptosis could open a new potential application for the therapeutic approach to reduce the side-effects of cancer treatment and to treat human diseases that are caused by excessive apoptosis such as degenerative diseases. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Protein expression and purification PCR was conducted to amplify the death domain of PIDD and RAIDD from the cDNA of full-length human PIDD (isoform3) and RAIDD, respectively. The plasmid vector, pET 26b (Novagen), was used to add a hexahistidine tag to the carboxy-terminus of PIDD DD, RAIDD DD and full-length RAIDD for affinity purification. The PCR products of PIDD DD were then digested with the NdeI and NotI (NEB) restriction enzymes, while the RAIDD DD and RAIDD PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI. The digested PCR products were then ligated into pET26b. Each protein was individually expressed in BL21 (DE3) RILP E. coli competent cells. Expression was induced by treating the bacteria with 0.5 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 20 °C. Cells expressing PIDD DD, RAIDD DD and RAIDD were then collected, resuspended and lysed by sonication in 50 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Tris buffer at pH7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole). Both lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were then applied to a gravity-flow column (Bio-Rad) packed with Ni­NTA affinity resin (Qiagen). The unbound bacterial proteins were then removed from the column using 500 ml of washing buffer (20 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 60 mM imidazole and 10% glycerol). The C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged PIDD DD, RAIDD DD and RAIDD were then eluted from the column using an elution buffer (20 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole). 2.2. Complex association assay Purified RAIDD DD was pre-incubated with PIDD DD for 5 to 60 min at room temperature and then the complex was subjected to the gel-filtration column. % of the complex was evaluated based on the appearance and height of the complex peak monitored with 280 nm wavelength. Amount of the complex formed after 60 min was considered as 100% complex. Same complex association assay was performed for RAIDD and PIDD DD complex.

2.3. Complex dissociation assay RAIDD DD:PIDD DD complex was prepared in Tris buffer (1 M Tris pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl). This complex was then pre-incubated with salt concentrations as high as 3 M, after which the mixture was subjected to gel-filtration column. % of the complex was evaluated based on the appearance and height of the complex peak monitored with 280 nm wavelength. Amount of the complex formed at standard buffer (control) containing 50 mM NaCl was considered as 100% complex. 2.4. Mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocols. Mutagenesis was then confirmed by sequencing (Cornell sequencing facility). Mutant proteins were prepared using the same method described above. 2.5. Native PAGE shift assay Formation of the complex between RAIDD DD and PIDD DD (including mutants) was assayed by native (non-denaturing) PAGE conducted on a PhastSystem (GE Healthcare) with pre-made 8­25% acrylamide gradient gels (GE Healthcare). Coomassie Brilliant Blue was used for staining and detection of shifted bands. To produce a stable complex, we mixed the proteins and then incubated the mixture for 1 h before further analysis. 2.6. Gel-filtration chromatography Separately purified and quantified RAIDD DD, PIDD DD and mutant R147E were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then subjected to a dominant negative assay. Mutant Y814A was assayed in the same way. Following pre-incubation, the mixture was concentrated to 15­20 mg ml- 1 using a concentration kit (Millipore). The concentrated protein mixture was then applied to a Superdex 200 gel-filtration column 10/30 (GE healthcare), which was pre-equilibrated with a solution of 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl. The formation of the complex was then detected by evaluating the positions of the eluted peak followed by SDS-PAGE. 3. Results 3.1. PIDDosome core part assembly is time-dependent Previous studies have shown that time is required for the PIDDosome dependent apoptosis [26,37]. Therefore, to determine if the formation of the core of PIDDosome is time-dependent, we biochemically assayed the formation of the complex after various lengths of time. Previous studies have shown that the core of PIDDosome, which is composed of 7 RAIDD DD and 5 PIDD DD, was fully assembled after 1 h of incubation at room temperature [37]. In current study, the increasing amount of the PIDDosome core part containing 7RAIDD DD and 5 PIDD DD as time passed was monitored at 280 nm wavelength during gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A). In addition, Native PAGE demonstrated that the new complex band became thicker and the RAIDD DD band became thinner as time passed (Fig. 1B). Excess PIDD DD was found to form a clear band at the bottom of the gel (Fig. 1B). All native gels from this study were stained with coomassie blue and a complex formation was then evaluated by the appearance of shifted bands. The results of this study clearly demonstrated that incubation for 5 min is not enough time for the formation of the complex to occur. These results are consistent with the need for pre-incubation to form a complete PIDDosome.

Fig. 1. Time and salt concentration-dependent PIDDosome formation. (A) Time-dependent complex formation. Purified RAIDD DD was pre-incubated with PIDD DD for 5 to 60 min at room temperature and then the complex was subjected to the gel-filtration column. % of the complex was evaluated based on the appearance and height of the complex peak monitored with 280 nm wavelength. Amount of the complex formed after 60 min was considered as 100% complex. (B) Purified RAIDD DD was pre-incubated with PIDD DD for 5 to 60 min at room temperature, after which the mixture was subjected to Native PAGE. The relationship between incubation time and complex formation was then evaluated based on the appearance and amount of a new complex band. Native PAGE showed that the new complex band was thicker and the RAIDD DD band was thinner as time passed. In addition, excess PIDD DD formed a clear band at the bottom of the gel. (C) RAIDD DD:PIDD DD complex was prepared in Tris buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl). This complex was then pre-incubated with salt concentrations as high as 3 M, after which the mixture was subjected to gel-filtration column. % of the complex was evaluated based on the appearance and height of the complex peak monitored with 280 nm wavelength. Amount of the complex formed at standard buffer (control) containing 50 mM NaCl was considered as 100% complex. (D) This complex in various salt concentrations was also subjected to Native PAGE. The effect of salt on complex formation was then evaluated based on the disappearance of the complex band and appearance of the new RAIDD DD band.

3.2. PIDDosome core part is sensitive to salt concentration Because the results of previous structural studies indicated that an appropriate salt concentration was critical for the formation of well diffracted crystals of the PIDDosome core, we evaluated the effect of salt on the complex. To accomplish this, we used Native PAGE. First, we generated stable RAIDD DD and PIDD DD complexes by mixing and incubating separately purified protein and then subjecting the mixtures to gel-filtration chromatography. An appropriate amount of NaCl was then added to the complex pre-formed. The complexes in various concentration of NaCl were subjected to both gel-filtration column and Native PAGE. % of the complex absolutely decreased as NaCl concentration increased (Fig. 1C). The results of Native PAGE also revealed that the addition of more NaCl resulted in dissociation of the complex (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the PIDDosome core part that contains the death domains is sensitive to the concentration of salt. 3.3. Point mutations R147E on RAIDD DD and Y814A on PIDD DD are dominant negative mutants We recently elucidated the crystal structure of the RAIDD DD:PIDD DD complex, which is in the core of the PIDDosome. Structure-based mutagenesis studies have shown that the presence of a point

mutation on RAIDD DD (R147 to E147:R147E) and on PIDD DD (Y814 to A814:Y814A) resulted in their failing to form a stable complex with their binding partner [37]. R147E on RAIDD DD plays critical role for the formation of binding interfaces of Type III R:P and Type III R:R interaction by forming hydrogen bond with many residues on the binding partner (Fig. 2 A,B). Y814A on PIDD DD is also important for the formation of binding interface of Type I P:P interaction (Fig. 2C). Among the many point mutants generated during previous structural studies that failed to form a PIDDosome complex, mutations of R147E and Y814A, which are conserved among RAIDD DDs and PIDD DDs across the species (Fig. 3A), showed the most obvious effect. To confirm these results, we performed Native PAGE and gel-filtration chromatography. The observation of a shifted band following Native PAGE and the absence of a complex peak on the gel-filtration profile clearly demonstrated that both point mutants failed to form a complex (Fig. 3B,C). Next, we evaluated the mutations to determine if they exerted a negative effect on the formation of the PIDDosome. To accomplish this, approximately equal amounts of R147E or Y814A were mixed with wild-type RAIDD DD and PIDD DD simultaneously and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h prior to being applied to the gel-filtration column. When we applied a mixture of wild-type RAIDD DD and PIDD DD without any mutants to the gel-filtration column (S-200, GE healthcare), the mixture formed a complex and

was eluted around 12 mL, which corresponds to its 152 kD size (Fig. 4). In contrast, a mixture of 3 proteins including either the R147E or Y814A mutant was eluted in the late fraction around 17 mL, which corresponds to its 14 kD size (Fig. 4). These findings indicated that both mutants, R147E on RAIDD DD and Y814A PIDD DD, are dominant negative mutants that interfere with the formation of a complex between wild-type RAIDD DD and PIDD DD. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3, R147E completely blocked the complex formation, indicating a strong dominant negative effect. Interestingly, incubation of the R147E mutant with wild-type RAIDD DD and PIDD DD resulted in the formation of a new peak around 14.5 mL that corresponded to 40 kD. In the case of the Y814A mutant, an aggregation of particles was formed when it was incubated with wild-type RAIDD DD and PIDD DD. Although these particles were removed by filtration and centrifugation prior to being applied to the column, some aggregation portions were detected on the gel-filtration profile (Fig. 4).

the dominant negative effects of the R147E and Y814A mutants are not applied when PIDDosome has already been formed.

4. Discussion In this study, we biochemically characterized the assembly mechanism by which PIDDosome is formed. The formation of the core portion of PIDDosome, which is composed of 7 RAIDD DD and 5 PIDD DD, was found to be dependent on time and the salt concentration. Consistent with the results of previous studies that suggested that approximately 1 h of incubation at 37 °C or room temperature is necessary for the assembly of active PIDDosome, the results of the present study showed that the PIDDosome core increased as time passed [26,37]. Previous structural studies have revealed that 3 different types and 8 completely different interfaces are required for oligomerization of the PIDDosome core and disruption of even one of the interfaces causes failure of complex formation [26,37]. This indicates that all 8 interfaces, formed by 7 RAIDD and 5 PIDD, should be located in the correct position. Based on this clue, we speculate that time-dependent assembly is to find the correct position to form 8 different interfaces. A time-consuming process absolutely is needed for such a complicated protein complex. These complicated interactions involved in the formation of the complex may explain why time is required for a stable complex to be formed. In the cell, apoptosis process has to be tightly regulated. This particularly important process decides cell's life or death. A recent study showed that PIDD might be a molecular switch that can control life and death [32,38]. This switch mediated PIDDosome formation should be well regulated to decide death or life. In this aspect, timedependent assembly of PIDDosome caused by the complexity of a core part may be necessary for fine regulation of PIDDosome formed by genotoxic stress.

3.4. The dominant negative effects of R147E and Y814A are not observed when PIDDosome is pre-formed Since both mutants, R147E and Y814A, can block the formation of a complex between RAIDD DD and PIDD DD, we evaluated these mutation effects to determine if they still applied after the RAIDD DD: PIDD DD complexes were formed. Therefore, we evaluated the ability of each mutant to dissociate RAIDD DD:PIDD DD complexes that had already been formed. Specifically, we examined the protein band pattern formed by the complex in the presence of each mutant on the Native PAGE. To accomplish this, the complex was purified and mixed with different concentrations of each mutant and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The mixtures were then loaded onto a Native PAGE. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, treatment with R147E and Y814A could not dissociate the complex. These findings indicate that

Fig. 3. Mutants R147E and Y814A failed to form a PIDDosome core. (A) Sequence alignment of RAIDD and PIDD from different species. The conserved residues, R147 on RAIDD and Y814 on PIDD, are shown as blue and red, respectively. (B) Point mutations on RAIDD DD (R147E) and PIDD DD (Y814A) were prepared and the location of the mutant bands were then compared to the locations of the wild-type bands following Native PAGE. To evaluate the formation of PIDDosome with mutants, R147E and Y814A were incubated with wildtype PIDD DD and RAIDD DD, respectively, after which the mixtures were subjected to Native PAGE. The locations of each component on the Native gel are indicated by an arrow. (C) The wild-type RAIDD DD:PIDD DD, wild-type PIDD DD:R147E, and wild-type RAIDD DD:Y814A mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then applied to an S-200 gel-filtration column (GE healthcare). The profile showed that the wild-type RAIDD DD:Y814A mixtures, indicated by blue, and the wild-type PIDD DD:R147E, indicated by black, failed to form a stable complex. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

During the structural studies, we realized that the complex formed several different types of crystals depending on the salt concentration [25]. In addition, the reproducibility of crystals was found to be highly sensitive to the salt concentration. Therefore, we evaluated the effect

of salt on the complex formation. The results of our study revealed that almost all of the death domains were involved in the complex formation when the reaction was conducted in solution containing 50 mM NaCl. Conversely, only a small amount of complex was formed

Fig. 5. Dominant negative effects of R147E and Y814A are not applied after PIDDosome is formed. Different concentrations of R147E(A) and Y814A(B) were added after the RAIDD DD:PIDD DD complex had been formed and then subjected to Native PAGE. The identities of the bands that appeared as determined by coomasie staining of Native gels are presented on the left panel.

when the reaction was conducted using higher salt concentrations (up to 3 M), which indicates that a high salt concentration inhibits the formation of a stable complex. Unlike RAIDD DD, successfully purified RAIDD full-length failed to form a stable complex with PIDD DD interestingly (data not shown). This data indicate that RAIDD itself possesses an inhibitory ability for PIDDosome formation with an unknown mechanism. Now we think that an unknown factor can allow RAIDD to bind PIDD and we are trying to find this unknown factor. In conclusion, because apoptosis is a life decision process that has to be regulated carefully, there are many regulation points to lead apoptosis. The complexity mediated time-spending process of the formation of the caspase-activating complex and the self-inhibitory ability of adaptor molecules such as RAIDD, FADD, ASC, might be important regulation mechanisms of apoptosis. Structure-based mutagenesis studies revealed that the point mutations on RAIDD DD (R147 to E147:R147E) and on PIDD DD (Y814 to A814:Y814A) could not form a stable complex with their binding partner. To evaluate the effects of mutations on PIDDosome formation, we tested the formation of PIDDosome in the presence of mutants. The results of the present study demonstrated that R147E and Y814A mutants interfered with the formation of PIDDosome, which suggests that both mutants exert a dominant negative effect on the formation of PIDDosome. However, those dominant negative effects were abolished after the core portions of the PIDDosome had been formed. Those mutants, R147E and Y814A, which show the dominant negative effect on the PIDDosome formation, might be a perfect candidate for the protein agent that can inhibit genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis by interfering assembly of PIDDosome. p53 tumor suppressor is a key mediator of stress response that protects normal cells from altering potentially dangerous cancer cells by inducing apoptosis in especially genotoxically damaged cells [39­41]. PIDD, one of the PIDDosome components, is also initially identified as

p53 Induced Death Domain containing protein (PIDD). Although p53 performed a critical role in the cells, under certain conditions, p53 activity can result in massive apoptosis, leading to severe pathological consequences [41]. A representative of such case is anti-cancer therapy that is openly associated with genotoxic stress, leading to excessive apoptosis [41]. This is a common side effect of cancer therapy. The discovery of dominant negative mutants R147E on RAIDD and Y814A on PIDD in this study that might inhibit genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis could open a new potential application for a therapeutic approach to reduce the side-effects of cancer treatment and to treat human diseases that are caused by excessive apoptosis such as degenerative diseases.
