The tRNAGly/Glycyl-tRNA synthetase system belongs to the so called `class II' in which tRNA identity elements consist of relative few and simple motifs, as compared to `class I' where the tRNA determinants are more complicated and spread over different parts of the tRNA, mostly including the anticodon. The determinants from `class II' although, are located in the aminoacyl stem and sometimes include the discriminator base. There exist predominant structure differences for the Glycyl-tRNA-synthetases and for the tRNAGly identity elements comparing eucaryotic/archaebacterial and eubacterial systems. We focus on comparative X-ray structure analysis of tRNAGly acceptor stem microhelices from different organisms. Here, we report the X-ray structure of the human tRNAGly microhelix isoacceptor G9990 at 1.18 Å resolution. Superposition experiments to another human tRNAGly microhelix and a detailed comparison of the RNA hydration patterns show a great number of water molecules with identical positions in both RNAs. This is the first structure comparison of hydration layers from two isoacceptor tRNA microhelices with a naturally occurring base pair exchange. Ó 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction Despite the fact that glycine is the most simple amino acid, the system to ensure the correct aminoacylation of the corresponding tRNA is highly divergent. The glycyl-tRNA-synthetase (GlyRS) and their cognate tRNAs belong to the class II synthetase system which is classified by a few simple tRNA identity elements [1]. These can be found as sequence motifs in the acceptor stem and include the discriminator base at position 73. The discriminator base is a major difference thereby that it must be an adenosine in eucaryotes and archaebacteria [2,3] whereas only uridine can be found at position 73 in eubacteria [4]. The eucaryotic/archaebacterial system can be distinguished from the eubacterial one with the interesting exception of Thermus thermophilus, an organism showing characteristics of both GlyRS systems. While the eucaryotic/archaebacterial GlyRS exists as a dimer of two identical subunits [2,3,5,6] the eubacterial enzyme is a tetrameric complex of two a- and two b-subunits [7,8]. It was shown that in Escherichia coli both types of subunits are necessary for enzymatic activity [7]: the b-subunits are responsible for tRNA

recognition and binding [9] while the a-subunits carry the ATP and glycine binding motifs [10,11]. The thermophilic eubacterium T. thermophilus is very interesting in this context because crystal structure analysis at 2.75 Å revealed that its GlyRS resembles the a2-architecture expected from eucaryotes or archaebacteria [12]. On the other hand the tRNAGly of this organism displays the eubacterial tRNA identity elements of a conserved base pair C2-G71 and the discriminator base U73 [4]. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of a tRNA acceptor stem microhelix derived from the human tRNAGly isoacceptor G9990 [13] at a resolution of 1.18 Å. We further performed superposition experiments to compare the new structure with the recently published human tRNAGly acceptor stem microhelix G9992 [14]. The identification of single water molecules allows a detailed analysis of the hydration pattern of these highly related molecules. The hydration of RNA is of high importance because the structural water molecules surrounding the RNA should be the first contact sites for RNA­protein interactions. Experimental procedures Crystallization of the human tRNAGly isoacceptor G9990 microhelix. The human tRNAGly microhelix with the sequence 50 -G1C2A3U4 U5G6G7-30 and 50 -C66C67A68A69U70G71C72-30 was derived from the

gene sequence with the following tRNA data base ID: DG9990 [13]. Using the vapour diffusion technique, crystals grew within 12 days at following conditions: 0.5 mM RNA, 10% (v/v) MPD (2-methyl2,4-pentanediol), 40 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 12 mM spermine tetrachloride, 80 mM potassium chloride and equilibration against 1 ml 35% MPD at 294 K [15]. The crystals had approximate dimensions of 0.1 Â 0.1 Â 0.3 mm and were flash-frozen directly in the crystallization solution prior to data collection. Acquisition of X-ray diffraction data. A high resolution data set was measured at the Diamond beam line I04 (UK) at a temperature of 100 K and a wavelength of 0.9696 Å. The crystallographic data were processed within the range of 50­1.18 Å using the HKL2000 package [16]. For analyzing the possibility of merohedral twinning the data were checked by the Padilla and Yeates algorithm [17], as implemented in the web server: http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/pystats, which gave the curve corresponding to a theoretically untwinned crystal. Structure determination, refinement and superposition experiments. For molecular replacement an initial model was build using the human tRNAGly (G9992) microhelix, pdb ID: 2V7R [14,18]. The sequence of this model was converted to the sequence of the human tRNAGly (G9990) by changing the base pairs at position 3­ 70 from G3-C70 to A3-U70 using the program COOT [19]. The generated tRNAGly microhelix was used for molecular replacement techniques and the structure was solved using the program PHASER [20]. Refinement of the structure was done with REFMAC5 [21] and the electron density maps were calculated with FFT [22]. All programs were used as implemented in the CCP4i suite [23]. Visualization and building of the structure was done with the programs COOT [19] and PYMOL [24]. For the calculation of average and local helical RNA parameters X3DNA [25] was used. Due to the almost identical crystal packing parameters of the two human tRNAGly microhelices G9990 and G9992 [14], superposition of RNA helices could be performed by overlaying the first structure with a symmetry equivalent RNA molecule of the second structure without further calculations. The coordinates of the tRNAGly microhelix G9990 structure have been deposited at the RSCB protein data bank with the pdb ID: 2VUQ. Results and discussion Crystallographic data and geometric parameters of the human tRNAGly microhelix The human tRNAGly acceptor stem microhelix, derived from the gene sequence DG9990 [13] (Fig. 1), crystallizes in the space group C2 with the following cell constants: a = 37.32 Å, b = 37.61 Å, c = 30.47 Å, b = 112.60° and one molecule per asymmetric unit (Table 1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using an RNA model which was generated from the human tRNAGly G9992 [14] from which the sequence was corrected to that of tRNAGly G9990. Crystallographic data were refined within the region of 50­1.18 Å resolution up to R-values of R/Rfree = 20.4/22.8% (Table 1). The structure of the human tRNAGly G9990 consists of 292 RNA atoms and 47 water molecules. A part of the electron density map covering the base pair C2-G71 is shown in Fig. 2. A selection of local geometric parameters of the human tRNAGly G9990 microhelix is shown in Table 2. The RNA adopts the standard conformation as known for A-RNA. The sugar puckering is in the 20 -exo-conformation for all nucleotides. All phosphate backbone a/c torsion angles adopt the (À) gauche/(+) gauche conformation and the b torsion angles show the anti conformation around ±180° (data not shown). The crystal packing parameters and the RNA conformation of the tRNAGly microhelix G9990 and the previously published tRNAGly microhelix G9992 [14,18] are very similar. This enabled

They differ in the third base pair, which is an A3-U70 in the here investigated tRNA and a G3-C70 in tRNAGly microhelix 9992 [14]. Both structures possess very similar helical parameters (Fig. 3). A superposition of the microhelices was possible by simply overlaying the first helix structure with a symmetry equivalent molecule

of the second RNA structure. Both microhelices show nearly identical RNA conformations (Fig. 3). We could identify a large number of water molecules which occupy directly the same position in the two tRNAGly microhelices G9990 and 9992. The G9990 isoacceptor microhelix contains 47 water molecules (Table 1) and the G9992 helix has 86 water oxygen atom loci [14]. Comparison of both structures leads to a total of 62 water molecules with identical location in both RNAs (blue/red dots in Fig. 3), whereas 71 waters have different positions (gray dots in Fig. 3). The superposition shows the first direct structure comparison of hydration layers between two RNA microhelix isoacceptors with a naturally occurring base pair exchange. A detailed picture of the hydration of selected base pairs in tRNAGly microhelix 9990 and 9992 is presented in Fig. 4. Base pair C2-G71, which is identical in both RNAs and is an important identity element in the E. coli tRNAGly [4], has three identical water positions in the two structures. The waters are located in the major groove and coordinate to the N4 of C2, the N7 and the oxygen phosphate of G71. In base pair G6-C67, identical water positions surround N6, N7 of G6, bridging over an additional water to the neighbouring oxygen phosphate and another water coordinating to O6 of C76. Additionally, there are two identical water positions in the minor groove within the region of the 20 -hydroxyl group of the G6 ribose. In summary, we observe identical hydration patterns for wide regions of both tRNAGly isoacceptor microhelices. The base pair at position 3­70 is different in both tRNAs: The A3-U70 in tRNAGly G9990 is G3-C70 in tRNAGly 9992. By comparing the hydration pattern in the major groove in this region, we can detect two water molecules with identical position in both RNAs, occupying the same position but coordinating to a different purine base in the two tRNAs: In tRNAGly 9990, the water binds to the N6 of A3, compared to a water coordinating to the O6 of G3 in tRNAGly 9992. This water is H-bonded to another water molecule, which again has identical positions in both tRNAGly major grooves (Fig. 3c). Regarding the tetragonal arrangement of the water directly bound to G3 vs. A3, the orientation has to be different concerning the hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, whereas the position of the water oxygen stays the same. The hydration of the tRNAGly microhelices is consistent with the general rules of RNA hydration [26]. The RNA sequence determines the hydrogen bonding to the water molecules that are in direct contact or even in second layer to the hydrogen bond acceptors

or bond donors of the nucleotides. On the other hand, the specific location of a water molecule in direct contact to RNA depends on the local geometric parameters of the nucleotide. The here described superposition experiment of the two human tRNAGly helices shows 31 identical water positions in both RNAs, which can be explained by the nearly identical local geometric parameters of the helices. The hydration layer of nucleic acids has to be considered as biologically important, because it may be the first contact site for interaction with proteins. Further comparative structure analyses are underway to examine the specific positions of water molecules in tRNA isoacceptors from different organisms.
