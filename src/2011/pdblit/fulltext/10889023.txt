ABSTRACT: Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) displays a preference for peptides containing acidic as well as aromatic/aliphatic residues immediately NH2-terminal to phosphotyrosine. The structure of PTP1B bound with DADEpYL-NH2 (EGFR988-993) offers a structural explanation for PTP1B's preference for acidic residues [Jia, Z., Barford, D., Flint, A. J., and Tonks, N. K. (1995) Science 268, 1754-1758]. We report here the crystal structures of PTP1B in complex with Ac-ELEFpYMDYE-NH2 (PTP1B,Con) and Ac-DAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG (PTP1B,Bpa) determined to 1.8 and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively. A structural analysis of PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa shows how aromatic/aliphatic residues at the -1 and -3 positions of peptide substrates are accommodated by PTP1B. A comparison of the structures of PTP1B, Con and PTP1B,Bpa with that of PTP1B,EGFR988-993 reveals the structural basis for the plasticity of PTP1B substrate recognition. PTP1B is able to bind phosphopeptides by utilizing common interactions involving the aromatic ring and phosphate moiety of phosphotyrosine itself, two conserved hydrogen bonds between the Asp48 carboxylate side chain and the main chain nitrogens of the pTyr and residue 1, and a third between the main chain nitrogen of Arg47 and the main chain carbonyl of residue -2. The ability of PTP1B to accommodate both acidic and hydrophobic residues immediately NH2-terminal to pTyr appears to be conferred upon PTP1B by a single residue, Arg47. Depending on the nature of the NH2-terminal amino acids, the side chain of Arg47 can adopt one of two different conformations, generating two sets of distinct peptide binding surfaces. When an acidic residue is positioned at position -1, a preference for a second acidic residue is also observed at position -2. However, when a large hydrophobic group occupies position -1, Arg47 adopts a new conformation so that it can participate in hydrophobic interactions with both positions -1 and -3.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases),1 together with protein tyrosine kinases, control the tyrosine phosphorylation state in the cell, which is important for cellular activities such as growth, differentiation, motility, cell-cell interactions, metabolism, gene transcription, and the immune response (1, 2). PTPases constitute a growing family of

transmembrane (receptor-like) and intracellular enzymes that rival the protein tyrosine kinases in terms of structural diversity and complexity. Extensive biochemical and structural studies on PTPases during the past 10 years have led to a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which PTPases catalyze phosphate monoester hydrolysis (3, 4). The exact functional roles of PTPases in cellular processes are currently under intensive investigation in numerous laboratories (5-9). PTP1B is the first PTPase to be purified and characterized (10-12) and is the prototypical intracellular PTPase found in a wide variety of human tissues (13). PTP1B is capable of dephosphorylating a number of receptor tyrosine kinases, including the insulin receptor, the EGF receptor, and the PDGF receptor (14-19). Transient overexpression of PTP1B and a panel of receptor tyrosine kinases showed that PTP1B preferentially dephosphorylates the receptor precursors localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (15), which is in accord with the known cellular localization of PTP1B to the endoplasmic reticulum (20, 21). Thus, the function of PTP1B is proposed to control the kinase function of nascent receptors during biosynthesis and transport to the cell surface (15). Such a mechanism may be critical in preventing the premature activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases in the

8172 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 28, 2000 cell. For this mechanism to work, PTP1B must exhibit broad substrate specificity so that it can cleave the phosphoryl moiety from multiple and diverse autophosphorylation sites in receptor tyrosine kinases with high efficiency. A further understanding of the specific functional roles that PTPases play in cellular signaling requires the identification of the physiological substrates for each member of the PTPase family and a detailed description of the structural features that control PTPase substrate specificity. Despite the remarkable progress in the identification and characterization of new PTPases and in the understanding of PTPase catalysis, the molecular basis by which PTPases distinguish and recognize the diverse substrates that they encounter in the cell remains elusive. This is partly because the physiological substrates for most PTPases remain unknown. Furthermore, since the physiological substrates for PTPases are phosphoproteins, even if the identity of the true physiological substrate is known, it remains a major obstacle to obtain quantities of specifically and stoichiometrically tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins required for detailed enzymological studies. Thus, the current approach for probing PTPase substrate specificity relies on the use of synthetic phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptides that correspond to the phosphorylated species found in vivo (22-31). PTP1B displays a wide range of kcat/Km values for relatively short peptide substrates. The kcat/Km values for some of the peptide substrates approach the diffusion limit and are 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than that of pY alone, suggesting that residues flanking the pY moiety make significant contributions to high-affinity binding and catalysis. The kinetic analysis of many naturally occurring phosphopeptides identified the undecapeptide, EGFR988-998 (epidermal growth factor receptor autophosphorylation site Tyr992, residues 988-998, DADEpYLIPQQG), as an excellent substrate for PTP1B (25, 26). Alanine-scanning analysis of the EGFR988-998 peptide revealed that PTP1B has a moderate preference for acidic residues at positions NH2terminal to pY, particularly at position -1 (26). However, other biochemical data indicate a preference for aromatic/ aliphatic residues at position -1. For example, when the Glu(-1) residue in EGFR988-998 is replaced with p-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa), the resulting Bpa peptide AcDAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG exhibits a kcat/Km similar to that of the parent peptide (Table 1; 32). In addition, peptide substrates in which the -1 position is occupied by an aromatic (Neu546-556, DNLYpYWDQNSS) or an aliphatic amino acid (p130Cas258-269, Ac-PATDLpYQVPPGP-NH2, and p130Cas380-391, Ac-PLLDVpYDVPPSV-NH2) also display kinetic parameters similar to that of the EGFR988-998 peptide (Table 1). These data suggest that PTP1B can accommodate large aromatic/aliphatic residues as well as acidic side chains at position -1. Indeed, a preference for acidic (Asp and Glu), aromatic (Phe and Tyr), and aliphatic (Leu, Ile, Val, and Thr) residues at position -1 has also been observed using an "inverse alanine scanning" peptide library approach (33). The consensus peptide Ac-ELEFpYMDYENH2 identified from this library contains a Phe at position -1 and is a potent substrate for PTP1B (Table 1). Given the biochemical data, it may be tempting to speculate that PTP1B's ability to recognize such diverse peptide sequences results primarily from interactions between PTP1B and the peptide backbone and that interactions with

a All measurements were performed at pH 6.6 and 30 °C except the consensus peptide, which was performed at pH 7.0 and 30 °C. kcat and Km values have been measured for EGFR988-998, EGFR988-993, Neu546-556, the Bpa peptide, and the consensus peptide (25, 27, 32, 33). Results from these studies and many others show that the kcat values of peptide substrates are similar for PTP1B. This is because the rate-limiting step corresponds to the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate. In the current work, only kcat/Km values have been measured for p130Cas258-269 and p130Cas380-391, assuming that they will display similar kcat values as well. b From ref 27. c From ref 25. d This study. e From ref 32. f From ref 33.

the peptide side chains make little contribution to binding and catalysis. This is not the case, however, as the kcat/Km for AAAApYAAAA is 10-fold lower than those of the best peptides and specific substitutions in peptide substrates lead to significant decreases in kcat/Km (26, 33). Furthermore, the crystal structure of the catalytically inactive mutant PTP1B (C215S) complexed with EGFR988-993 (34) indicates specific ionic interactions between the acidic side chains at positions -1 and -2 of the substrate and the basic PTP1B residues Arg47 and Lys41. This complex provides a structural basis for PTP1B's preference for acidic peptides; however, it does not explain how PTP1B can equally accommodate aromatic/aliphatic peptides. The ionic interactions observed between the basic residues of the enzyme and acidic residues of the EGFR peptide would seem to preclude an equal preference for aromatic/aliphatic amino acids at the same position, suggesting that additional determinants for peptide substrate recognition by PTP1B must exist. Since the available PTP1B,EGFR988-993 structure does not provide a satisfactory structural explanation for the recognition of Ac-DAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG and Ac-ELEFpYMDYENH2 by PTP1B, we have determined the X-ray structures of PTP1B bound with these two peptides. The crystal structures of the catalytically inactive C215S mutant of PTP1B bound with the consensus peptide, Ac-ELEFpYMDYE-NH2 (PTP1B, Con), and Ac-DAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG (PTP1B,Bpa), show how these two peptides are accommodated within the peptide-binding surface of PTP1B. A comparison of the structures of PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa with that of PTP1B,EGFR988-993 reveals the structural basis for the ability of PTP1B to bind peptides of diverse sequences. The characterization and detailed understanding of PTP1B substrate recognition may assist in the development of potent PTP1B specific inhibitors and may contribute to the effort in the identification of in vivo substrates of PTP1B.

Structural Basis of PTP1B Substrate Specificity PATDLpYQVPPGP-NH2, and p130Cas380-391 Ac-PLLDVpYDVPPSV-NH2 were synthesized, purified, and characterized as described previously (25, 32, 33). The C215S mutant form of PTP1B was purified as described previously (35). Determination of Kinetic Constants. All assays were performed at 30 °C in 50 mM 3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M ionic strength buffer (pH 7). A continuous spectrophotometric assay previously described (31) was employed to determine kcat/Km for the pY-containing peptides. The dephosphorylation reaction was monitored by an increase in absorbance at 282 nm (25), measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 14 spectrophotometer equipped with a waterjacketed cell holder, permitting maintenance of the reaction mixture at the desired temperature (30 °C). Cocrystallization of PTP1B/C215S with Peptide Substrates. Crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C using slight modifications of methods previously described (34, 35). Stock solutions of PTP1B/ C215S (10 mg/mL) in 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 25 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 3.0 mM DTT were prepared with either 5 mM Ac-DAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG peptide or 150 µM AcELEFpYMDYE-NH2 peptide. In each well, a 5 µL drop of each stock solution was mixed with an equal volume of the precipitating solution [0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.0-7.5), 0.2 M magnesium acetate, and 12-20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (Fluka)] and the mixture equilibrated against 1 mL of the precipitating solution. Data Collection and Processing. For the complex between PTP1B/C215S and Ac-ELEFpYMDYE-NH2, a single crystal was transferred at 4 °C directly into a cryoprotectant solution that contained crystallization buffer, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 150 µM peptide. The crystal was transferred to a loop and cooled in nitrogen gas. A wavelength of 0.9795 Å was used to collect 363 frames of 0.5° each using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector at beamline X9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). A single crystal of the complex between PTP1B/C215S and Ac-DAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG was transferred at 4 °C in increments of 5% glycerol concentration (2 min interval at each concentration) to a final cryoprotectant solution that contained crystallization buffer, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mM peptide. The crystal was transferred to a loop and flashcooled in a stream of nitrogen gas at 140 K. A wavelength of 1.20 Å was used to collect 150 frames of 1° each on Fuji image plates utilizing the custom-built apparatus described previously (35) at beamline X9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory). All data were reduced with the HKL package of programs (36) using an I/I cutoff of 0. Data reduction statistics are shown in Table 2. Analysis of the data with DATAMAN (37) indicated significant anisotropy in the data set of the complex with Ac-DAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG, where the intensity fell off significantly more slowly along the l axis. Structure Solution. Both structures were determined by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (38). The starting model used in both cases was the structure of PTP1B/ C215S in the presence of 53 mM pTyr (35), but with solvent molecules, ligands, and loop residues 179-189 deleted. A single outstanding peak with a correlation coefficient greater than twice the height of the next highest peak was observed

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 28, 2000 8173 in the cross-rotation search of both structures, and both translation functions exhibited a major peak with a correlation coefficient 1.6-1.7 times higher than that of the second highest peak (Table 2). The refinement of both structures using the programs X-PLOR (39) and CNS 0.9 (40) proceeded essentially identically. Rigid-body refinement using 8.0-3.0 Å data was followed by 4000 K simulated annealing against 25.0-2.5 Å data with the incorporation of an isotropic bulk solvent model (41). Density for the loop (residues 179-189) and peptide was evident immediately after the first round of refinement. Subsequent rounds of refinement consisted of simulated annealing, positional refinement, and temperature factor refinement using 25.0-1.9 Å data for the AcDAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG complex and 25.0-1.8 Å data for the Ac-ELEFpYMDYE-NH2 complex. Global anisotropic temperature factors B11, B22, and B33 were refined at the beginning of each round of refinement for both data sets. Model building was performed using the program O (42). Simulated annealing OMIT maps (43), Rfree values (44), PROCHECK (45), and WHAT IF (46) were employed to ensure correct model building and stereochemistry. The Ac-ELEFpYMDYE-NH2 complex included residues 2-298 of the enzyme, peptide residues corresponding to LEFpYMDYE, 226 water molecules, and one magnesium ion. The final model of the complex with Ac-DAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG consisted of residues 1-299 of PTP1B/C215S, peptide residues corresponding to AD(Bpa)pYLIP, 300 water molecules, one magnesium ion, and two acetate ions. Final refinement statistics are shown in Table 2. RESULTS The crystal structure of PTP1B/C215S in complex with the hexapeptide DADEpYL-NH2 (PTP1B,EGFR988-993) shows that Arg47 plays an important role in interacting with acidic amino acids at position -1 (34). Results from NMR and molecular dynamics studies of DADE(F2Pmp)L (F2Pmp, phosphonodifluoromethylphenylalanine) bound to PTP1B (47) are in agreement with the crystal structure. These observations offer a structural explanation for the preference of PTP1B for acidic residues NH2-terminal to pY (25, 28). However, there are considerable data in the literature suggesting that PTP1B is somewhat promiscuous in its substrate preference as it dephosphorylates a wide variety of proteins and peptide substrates (25, 28, 33, 48). For example, PTP1B hydrolyzes several unrelated pY-containing peptides with almost equal efficiency as the EGFR peptides (Table 1). It appears that, in addition to acidic residues, both aromatic (F, Y, or Bpa) and aliphatic (V or L) amino acids can also occupy position -1 in efficient peptide substrates (33). Furthermore, a selection for aromatic and aliphatic residues, in addition to the general preference for acidic residues at position -1, has also been observed in affinity selections from targeted peptide libraries containing nonhydrolyzable pY mimics (F2Pmp or malonyltyrosine) using the EGF receptor peptide DADEpYL as a template (49, 50). These results suggest that the -1 binding site possesses a remarkable degree of flexibility so that residues with drastically different structures can be accommodated. The crystal structures of PTP1B in complex with the consensus peptide derived from the inverse alanine scanning approach,

Ac-ELEFpYMDYE-NH2 (PTP1B,Con), and the EGFR988-998 peptide in which the Glu(-1) is substituted with Bpa, AcDAD(Bpa)pYLIPQQG (PTP1B,Bpa), provide a structural mechanism for this plasticity. Structures of PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa. The final model for the PTP1B,Con structure included protein residues 2-298 and all residues in the consensus peptide except for the extreme NH2-terminal Glu. The structure was refined to an R factor of 0.183 (Rfree ) 0.212) for data to 1.8 Å resolution. The PTP1B,Bpa model was refined to an R factor of 0.188 (Rfree ) 0.217) for data to 1.9 Å resolution, which

included protein residues 1-299 and the Bpa peptide residues from -3 to 3. The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Residues of the phosphopeptides bound to PTP1B were fitted unambiguously to well-defined electron density (Figure 1), although that for the residue at position -4 of the consensus peptide and those for positions -4, 4, 5, and 6 of the Bpa peptide were not visible. The overall structures of PTP1B in the two crystal forms described here are quite similar to each other and to the EGFR988-993 complex, as demonstrated by CR rmsd values of 0.3-0.5 Å (Table 2). A comparison between the two

PTP1B,peptide complexes and the ligand free form of PTP1B (54) showed that the overall protein structures are similar, with significant conformational differences confined to the active site upon ligand binding. In both cases, substrate binding induces the closure of the WPD loop (encompassing residues 179-189), which brings the general acid Asp181 in proximity to the ester oxygen in the substrate for efficient catalysis (4). Similar closed WPD loop conformations have also been observed in the oxyanion-bound Yersinina PTPase (55) and the pTyr- and DADEpYL-bound PTP1B structures (34, 35). Mode of Peptide Binding in PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa. The bound peptides in the two structures have the same NH2to COOH-terminal orientations, similar to that observed for DADEpYL-NH2 in the PTP1B,EGFR988-993 structure (Figure 2). The backbones of all three peptides are approximately in an extended -strand conformation, with some deviations toward the terminal residues (Figure 2 and Table 3). The position and environment of the pTyr residues of all three peptides are similar, with the phosphate moiety and the phenyl ring of the pTyr residue participating in hydrophobic

and electrostatic interactions nearly identical to those observed in other PTP1B,substrate complexes (34, 35). The terminal nonbridge phosphate oxygens form an extensive array of hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogens of the phosphate-binding loop (residues 215-221) and the guanidinium side chain of Arg221 (Figure 3). The phenyl ring of the pTyr residue is effectively buried within an active site cavity, formed by the nonpolar side chains of Ala217 and Ile219 of the phosphate-binding loop, Phe182 of the WPD loop, and Tyr46, Val49, and Gln262 (Figure 3). Specific polar interactions between the enzyme and the peptide backbone stabilize the binding interface in both the PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa structures in a manner identical to that observed in the PTP1B,EGFR988-993 complex (34). Most notably, Asp48 forms two hydrogen bonds to the main chain nitrogens of the pTyr and position 1 residues in both PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa structures (Figures 3 and 4). In addition, the main chain nitrogen of Arg47 forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of Glu(-2) in the consensus peptide and with the main chain carbonyl of Asp(-2) in the Bpa peptide (Figures 3 and 4).

In both peptide-bound structures, specific interactions between peptide side chains and PTP1B are also observed. The bulky aromatic residues at position -1, Phe and Bpa in the PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa structures, respectively, occupy a largely hydrophobic patch formed by the aliphatic portions (i.e., methylene carbons) of the side chains of Arg47 and Asp48 (Figures 3 and 4), so that the proximal aromatic ring of Bpa and the ring of Phe are essentially superimposable (Figures 2 and 5). Leu(-3) of the consensus peptide makes a distinct van der Waals contact with the distal portion of the Arg47 side chain (Figures 3 and 4). At position 1, the Met of the consensus peptide and the Leu of the Bpa peptide reside in a largely hydrophobic pocket formed by the aliphatic side chains of Asp48, Val49, Ile219, and Gln262 (Figure 3). Additionally, the phenolic oxygen of the Tyr(3) residue in the PTP1B,Con structure participates in a hydrogen bonding interaction with the carboxylic side chain of Asp48. Since the extended conformation of the peptide ligand directs side chains of adjacent residues in opposite directions, the carboxylic side chains of Glu(-2), Asp(2), and Glu(4)

in the consensus peptide are pointed away from the enzyme. Asp(-2) and Ile(2) of the Bpa peptide also do not form any obvious interactions with the enzyme. Because the remaining peptide residues [Glu(-4) in the consensus peptide, and Asp(-4), Gln(4), Gln(5), and Gly(6) of the Bpa peptide] cannot be observed in the structures, additional interactions with these residues, if present, are likely to be weak.

Structural Basis of PTP1B Substrate Specificity DISCUSSION A comparison of the PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa structures with the existing PTP1B,EGFR988-993 structure reveals peptide sequence specific conformational changes in PTP1B and certain conserved structural characteristics which remain constant regardless of the sequence of the bound peptide. Localized conformational changes in PTP1B as well as differences in the secondary structure of the bound peptides (especially at the extreme NH2-terminal positions) are also seen between the PTP1B,EGFR988-993 structure and the PTP1B,Con and the PTP1B,Bpa structures. The conserved mode of interactions between the peptides and PTP1B and the unique peptide sequence specific conformational changes in PTP1B provide a structural basis for the observed plasticity in PTP1B substrate recognition. Common Mode of Interaction. In all three structures, the bound peptide is similarly oriented (Figure 2), maintaining the same NH2- to COOH-terminal direction relative to the protein surface. In addition, the backbones of certain positionally equivalent residues are in similar conformations in all three bound peptides. All three structures maintain two conserved hydrogen bonds between the Asp48 carboxylate side chain and the main chain nitrogens of the pTyr and residue 1, and a third between the main chain nitrogen of Arg47 and the main chain carbonyl of residue -2 (Figures 3 and 4). Consequently, the peptide backbones of residues from positions -1 to 1 in all three structures adopt a twisted -strand conformation (Figure 2). This ensures that the pTyr is bound to PTP1B in an identical manner, regardless of the specific sequence adjacent to it. Since Asp48 (or Asn) is conserved among all PTPases (57),2 and its interactions with pTyr and residue 1 are conserved in all known crystal structures, Asp48 may be the primary and common determinant of the overall peptide orientation, and of the conformation of residues -1 to 1 (34, 57). Indeed, the D48A mutation of PTP1B does not show any adverse effects on the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, which lacks the corresponding main chain nitrogens. In contrast, when the EGFR988-998 peptide is used as a substrate, the D48A mutant exhibits a 22-fold decrease in kcat/Km (57), consistent with the loss of two hydrogen bonds to the main chain nitrogens at the pTyr and position 1 residues. Interestingly, the D48A mutation has little effect on the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (EP), since the tyrosyl peptide with which the side chain of Asp48 interacts with is no longer present in the active site during E-P hydrolysis (57). These kinetic results are consistent with the structural data and suggest that Asp48 plays an important role in positioning the peptide substrates in an optimal conformation for peptide binding and/or the initial nucleophilic attack by the active site Cys residue. Arg47 Is the Major Determinant for the Plasticity of Recognition for Amino Acids NH2-Terminal to pTyr. The guanidinium group of Arg47 in the PTP1B,EGFR988-993 structure is engaged in favorable electrostatic interactions with the side chains of Glu(-1) and Asp(-2) (Figure 4a).
2 It should be noted that there are a few PTPases in which residues other than Asp or Asn have been found at this position, most notably, the cytoplasmic EC-PTP and LC-PTP, and the receptor-like PTPases, PTP, IA-2, and IA-2 (57). However, it is not clear whether these proteins are active tyrosine phosphatases.

Green dashed lines represent hydrogen bonds conserved in all three complexes. Red dashed lines represent peptide specific hydrogen bonds.

Atom colors are as follows: carbon, gray; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red; and sulfur and phosphorus, yellow. This figure was generated using SETOR (51).

In this structure, the side chain of Arg47 also forms a long hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of Asp(-4) (34). In the PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa structures, the bulky aromatic moieties at the -1 position, Phe and Bpa, respectively, induce a repositioning of the Arg47 side chain, highlighted by a change in the 1 angle of 120° (Table 3) and a 7 Å shift of the guanidinium carbon from the position observed in the PTP1B,EGFR988-993 structure (Figure 5). This shift prevents the potential interactions between Arg47 and the residue at the -4 position in the PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa structures, as Arg47 now adopts a different side chain conformation. Since the position -4 residue is not visible in the PTP1B,Con and the PTP1B,Bpa structures, it is most likely not participating in any interactions with PTP1B. The shift in the position of the Arg47 side chain enables PTP1B to accommodate aromatic residues at position -1.

a The k 988-998 cat values for PTP1B and the R47E mutant with EGFR are similar, and the decrease in kcat/Km is attributed to an increase in Km (57). Only kcat/Km values have been measured for the consensus and the all-Ala peptides, assuming that PTP1B and the R47E mutant hydrolyze them with similar kcat values and the changes in kcat/Km reflect variations in Km.

FIGURE 5: Superposition of the refined coordinates of Arg47 and the -1 residues of the EGFR988-993 peptide (gray), the consensus peptide (yellow), and the Bpa peptide (green). This figure was generated using SETOR (51).

In the PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa structures, the aromatic side chain of Phe and the proximal ring of Bpa at position -1 contact the aliphatic portions of the side chains of Arg47 and Asp48 (Figures 3 and 4b,c). The placement of Arg47 in the PTP1B,Con structure also creates a unique hydrophobic contact with the Leu(-3) of the consensus peptide (Figure 4b) not present in the PTP1B,EGFR988-993 or the PTP1B, Bpa complex. In short, the movement of Arg47 generates an altered binding mode for the NH2-terminal residues, which is electrostatically and topologically distinct from that seen in the PTP1B,EGFR988-993 structure. Consistent with previous biochemical data, model building based on the PTP1B, Con structure shows that Ile, Leu, Thr, and Val can all be effectively accommodated at position -1 without steric interference, as can Leu and Gln at position -3. We propose that the conformation of Arg47 serves as the major determinant that allows for the accommodation of two types of peptide structures. When an acidic residue is positioned at position -1, as in the PTP1B,EGFR988-993 structure, a preference for a second acidic residue is observed at position -2. However, when a large hydrophobic group occupies position -1, Arg47 adopts a new conformation so that it can participate in hydrophobic interactions with both positions -1 and -3. To further substantiate the direct involvement of Arg47 in two distinct peptide binding modes, we measured the kcat/ Km, the substrate specificity constant, for wild-type PTP1B and the R47E mutant using DADEpYLIPQQG (EGFR988-998), Ac-ELEFpYMDYE-NH2 (the consensus peptide), and the all-Ala peptide, Ac-AAAApYAAAA-NH2. The observation that the kcat/Km values for the all-Ala peptide are similar for the wild type and the R47E mutant PTP1B further supports the notion that the side chain of Arg47 is primarily involved in side chain-side chain interactions with the substrates (Table 4). The finding that the all-Ala peptide is only 10fold less efficient than the EGFR988-998 and the consensus peptides is in accord with the observation that the major interactions between PTP1B and peptide substrates involve the pTyr itself and the peptide backbone (ref 34 and this

study). The Glu47 side chain retains most of the Arg47 atoms involved in the hydrophobic interaction with residue -1 of the consensus peptide, but lacks the guanidinium group which participates in ionic interactions with the NH2-terminal acidic side chains of the EGFR988-998 peptide. Thus, the R47E mutant would be expected to accommodate aromatic amino acids more easily than acidic residues at position -1, which is borne out by the finding that the R47E mutant exhibits a 7.9-fold decrease in kcat/Km for the EGFR988-998 peptide but only a 2.7-fold decrease for the consensus peptide in comparison to wild-type PTP1B (Table 4). The slight decrease in kcat/Km for the R47E-catalyzed hydrolysis of the consensus peptide may be due to the lack of interaction between Glu47 and the side chain of Leu at position -3 (Figure 3a). Collectively, these results are consistent with the ability of Arg47 to interact with both acidic and hydrophobic residues. Conclusions and Implications. Biochemical data summarized in this paper show that PTP1B possesses a rather relaxed specificity, capable of hydrolyzing peptide substrates with diverse sequence variations. The current structural analysis of PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa shows how PTP1B is able to accommodate hydrophobic residues at position -1 of peptide substrates. A comparison of the structures of PTP1B,Con and PTP1B,Bpa with that of PTP1B,EGFR988-993 reveals the structural basis for the plasticity of PTP1B substrate recognition. The dominant interactions involve pTyr itself and the hydrogen bonds between peptide main chain atoms and the protein. The ability to accommodate both acidic and hydrophobic residues immediately NH2-terminal to pTyr appears to be conferred upon PTP1B by a single residue, Arg47. Depending on the nature of the NH2-terminal amino acids, the side chain of Arg47 can adopt two different conformations, generating two sets of distinct peptide binding surfaces. The ability of PTP1B to recognize common substrate features and to generate altered binding surfaces is central to its function as a broad specificity PTPase. Importantly, the unique topology and electrostatic potential associated with PTP1B plasticity should assist in the design of PTP1B specific inhibitors. Since mice lacking functional PTP1B exhibit increased sensitivity toward insulin and are resistant to obesity (19), specific inhibition of PTP1B may be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, and obesity.
