The yeast Vts1 SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain is a member of a new class of SAM domains that specifically bind RNA. To elucidate the structural basis for RNA binding, the solution structure of the Vts1 SAM domain, in the presence of a specific target RNA, has been solved by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The Vts1 SAM domain retains the "core" five-helix-bundle architecture of traditional SAM domains, but has additional short helices at N and C termini, comprising a small substructure that caps the core helices. The RNAbinding surface of Vts1, determined by chemical shift perturbation, maps near the ends of three of the core helices, in agreement with mutational data and the electrostatic properties of the molecule. These results provide a structural basis for the versatility of the SAM domain in protein and RNA-recognition.

The SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain is a common protein­protein interaction module, identified in a wide variety of eukaryotic proteins, including the signal transducing EphB2 and EphA4 receptors, the transcriptional repressors TEL and polyhomeotic (Ph), and the splice variants (p73 and p63) of the tumor suppressor p53.1­6 Recently, we and others showed that the SAM domain of Smaug (Smg), a protein required

for proper abdominal segmentation in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos, encodes a novel protein­RNA, rather than a traditional protein­ protein, interaction module.7,8 Smg acts during early Drosophila development to repress the translation of maternal nanos (nos) mRNA by binding to a 23 nt RNA hairpin, consisting of a nine base-pair stem and a CUGGC loop, within the so-called TCE (translation control element) of the 3 0 untranslated region of nos mRNA.9,10 The mechanism by which Smg represses translation is not yet defined, although it may involve interference with both pre- and post-initiation events.11,12 In addition, Smg has been shown to play a role in the degradation of maternal Hsp83 mRNA.13 Although structures are known for several SAM domains that mediate protein­protein interactions (as homo- and hetero-typic oligomers),6 the only structure known for a SAM domain that mediates protein­RNA interactions is the Smg

All Figures were generated using MOLMOL.17 (a) Stereo pair of the 20 lowest energy structures from the final round of calculations. Backbone is in blue, aromatic side-chains are in red, and other side-chains are in green. (b) Stereo pair ribbons representation of a representative structure. Methods: The C terminus of Vts1 (residues 407­523) was expressed as a glutathione-Stransferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified using glutathione beads. The 86 residue SAM domain, encompassing the natural C-terminal tyrosine (residues 438­523), was released by papain proteolysis and further purified using MonoS beads. The Vts1 SAM domain can be concentrated up to 2 mM in 20 mM Na3PO4, 100 mM NaCl (pH 6.25) buffer. For 15N and 13C isotopic enrichment, E. coli cells were grown in M9 minimal media with [15N]ammonium chloride or [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) as appropriate. Resonance assignments and NOE constraints were obtained using a 0.5 mM 1:1 complex of U-15N,13C-labeled Vts1 SAM domain and natural abundance 13 nt TCE at 30 8C (calibrated using a 100% methanol standard). All NMR experiments were recorded on Bruker DRX600, DRX700 or DRX800 spectrometers, equipped with triple resonance cryoprobes and z-axis pulsed field gradients (Columbia University and the New York Structural Biology Center). Resonance assignments were determined using standard HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, (H)C(CCO)NH-TOCSY and H(C)CH-COSY double and triple-resonance experiments.18 Internuclear 1H­1H distance restraints were derived from 15N-edited and aromatic and aliphatic 13C-edited 1H­1H NOESY experiments.18 Backbone f and j dihedral restraints were determined from 15N, 13C 0 , 13Ca and 13Cb chemical shifts using the program TALOS.19 Ambiguous distance restraint assignment, distance calibration and spin-diffusion correction were achieved using ARIA 2.0.20 Structure calculations were performed using standard simulated annealing protocols implemented in CNS,21 using torsion angle dynamics. Eight iterations of structure calculations were performed. After each round of structure calculation, the seven structures

1067 for a 1.5-fold molar excess of RNA. Thus, the Vts1 SAM domain forms a 1:1 complex with the 15 nt TCE RNA that is in slow exchange on the NMR chemical shift timescale. These data are consistent with a KdZ14 nM measured by steadystate fluoresescence polarization anisotropy for the wild-type 15 nt TCE.8 Next, HSQC spectra were recorded for 1:1 mixtures of Vts1 SAM domain with 13 nt, 11 nt and 9 nt TCE constructs (containing four, three, and two base-pairs in the stem, respectively). The spectrum for the 13 nt hairpin (5 0 -GGCUCUGGCAGCC-3 0 ):Vts1 SAM domain mixture was indistinguishable from that of the 15 nt complex, suggesting that both hairpins form similar high-affinity, slow-exchange complexes with Vts1 SAM domain. Fewer new resonances were observed in the spectrum of the 11 nt hairpin (5 0 -GCUCUGGCAGC-3 0 ):Vts1 SAM domain mixture, suggesting that, although a specific slow-exchange complex is formed, the protein­RNA interactions are somewhat different than for complexes with longer TCE elements. The spectrum of the 9 nt hairpin (5 0 -CUCUGGCAG-3 0 ):Vts1 SAM domain mixture was nearly unchanged, compared to the spectrum of the apo Vts1 SAM domain, suggesting that the 9 nt TCE does not form a stable complex with Vts1 SAM domain. The observed differences may reflect reduced stability of the shorter hairpin structures (a hypothesis supported by calculations using MFOLD15). Based on these results, 13 nt TCE (with four base-pair stem) was chosen as optimal for subsequent studies of the complex with the Vts1 SAM domain. The solution structure of the Vts1 SAM domain in complex with the 13 nt TCE was determined by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy as described in the legend to Figure 1; statistics summarizing the structure determination are given in Table 1. The Vts1 SAM domain is a helical bundle (Figure 1), composed of one long helix (a5) and several short helices (aA, aB, a1­a4, aC). The "core" of this helical bundle (a1­a5) is similar in structure to the apo Smg SAM domain (Figure 2), but the N and C termini are both longer and folded differently. Whereas helix a1 in the Smg SAM domain is preceded by a few residues that lack secondary structure (the "N-terminal arm"), two additional short helices (aA and aB) are present in the Vts1 SAM domain, and the N terminus is located on the opposite side of the core than in the Smg SAM domain. The C terminus also follows a different path than in the Smg SAM domain: it encompasses a single turn of helix (aC) and packs against the N-terminal helices (aA and aB). The N and C

RNA-binding domain (RBD), consisting of a SAM domain affixed to a novel pseudo-HEAT analogous topology (PHAT) domain.7 Surprisingly, the structure, together with genetic analysis, revealed that the SAM domain (and not the PHAT domain) interacts specifically with RNA.7 This finding was bolstered by biochemical and mutational analysis of a Smaug homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Vts1, which has a standalone SAM domain (without a PHAT domain) and therefore is a more typical member of the new class of RNA-binding SAM domains.8 The Smg binding site on nanos mRNA, the TCE, was originally defined through experiments that determined the RNA sequence required for regulation of translation.14 The Vts1 SAM domain binds the TCE hairpin with high affinity (KDZ 14 nM) and has the same sequence specificity as the Smg RBD.8 The stem structure is required for binding, although the nucleotide sequence of the stem is not critical. The first, third, and fourth nucleotides of the CUGGC loop are essential for binding. The second and fifth nucleotides in the CUGGC loop are not specifically recognized. The fifth nucleotide can be excised from the loop without loss of affinity.8 The consensus sequence for Vts1-loop recognition is therefore CNGGN (or CNGG), where N is any base. The wild-type TCE sequence contains a G:U wobble base-pair in the stem; in our experiments, the U is mutated to C in order to stabilize the stem. We report the solution structure of the standalone Vts1 SAM domain, determined in the presence of a cognate TCE RNA hairpin by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. We also report chemical shift changes in Vts1, observed upon binding RNA, that are highly localized and correlate well with earlier mutational analysis.7,8 Together, these studies point to a common RNAbinding surface in these novel stand-alone RNAbinding SAM domains. The length of the TCE stem required for high-affinity binding was determined first. An 15 N-labeled sample of Vts1 SAM domain was titrated with 15 nt (five base-pair stem) TCE RNA hairpin with the sequence 5 0 -AGGCUCUGGCAGCCU-3 0 . The titration was monitored by recording 1 H­15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra (data not shown). In the presence of sub-saturating quantities of RNA, new resonance peaks were observed in the spectra, in addition to the resonances of the apo protein. The intensities of the new peaks increased, and intensities of the resonances of the apo protein decreased, until 1:1 stoichiometry was obtained. No further changes were observed

(out of 20) with the lowest energies were used for ambiguous restraint assignment in the next iteration. Residual dipole couplings (RDCs) for backbone N­H moieties were obtained from apparent splittings in 1H­15N IPAP22 spectra recorded without decoupling during the indirect evolution period for isotropic and weakly aligned (18 mg/ml Pf1 phage (ASLA Biotech, Ltd.)) samples.

1070 termini in the Vts1 SAM domain thus delineate a small helical substructure (aA, aB and aC) that caps the core helices (a1­a5), and partially substitutes for the PHAT domain in the Smg RBD.7 Chemical shifts for residues in the helical substructure are nearly identical for apo and complexed Vts1 SAM domain, suggesting that the substructure is present in both species. The close apposition of the N and C termini is evident from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) contacts between Pro450 in aB and Asp519 and Ala522 in ° aC, resulting in a distance of only 4.7 A between the Ca atoms of Pro450 and Ala522. Importantly, the C terminus of the Vts1 SAM domain construct (defined by proteolysis) extends to the natural C-terminal tyrosine; resistance to proteolysis can be explained by tight packing of the C terminus against the N terminus. NOE contacts between Leu447 in aA and Trp459 and Leu463 in a1 indicate that the N-terminal helices are closely packed against the SAM domain of Vts1. The extreme N terminus in this construct, residues 438­440, however, is devoid of NOE contacts, is not constrained in the structural ensemble, and is likely to be disordered in solution. The N terminus may be a flexible linker to N-terminal domains of as yet undefined function and structure in full-length Vts1. The Smg SAM domain structure7 was determined in the absence of RNA, whereas the Vts1 SAM domain structure reported herein was complexed with RNA. Nonetheless, leaving the structurally diverse N and C termini aside, the core Vts1 and Smg SAM domains superimpose ° with an RMSD of w1.49 A (over 49 Ca atoms). Thus, from this superposition, SAM domains do not experience major structural rearrangements upon RNA binding. Interestingly, the Vts1 SAM domain is perhaps slightly closer in structure to the SAM domains of EphB2 (Figure 2) and EphA4 tyrosine kinase ° receptors (RMSD versus EphBZ1.45 A over 62 Ca atoms, for example) even though these SAM domains participate in traditional protein­protein interactions, rather than RNA binding.1,2 Furthermore, the N terminus of Vts1 SAM domain (residues preceding a1) traces a path

akin to the N terminus of EphB2 and EphA4 SAM domains, rather than the Smg SAM domain (described above). In EphB2 and Eph4A SAM domains, the N-terminal arm is implicated in the oligomerization of the receptor,1,2 and the corresponding residues are not conserved in Vts1. Vts1 forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex when titrated with the TCE hairpin, and no evidence for dimerization is observed in NMR spectra. Aviv et al. also have shown by static light-scattering that Vts1 forms a 1:1 stiochiometric complex with RNA.8 Residues on the surface of the Vts1 SAM domain responsible for binding RNA were identified by comparing 1H­15N HSQC spectra for apo-Vts1 and Vts1 in complex with the 13 nt TCE RNA (Figure 3(a)). Chemical shift perturbations upon binding of RNA (Figure 3(a) and (c)) are concentrated in two regions of the primary structure: residues Lys461-Asp470, which are located over the C terminus of helix a1, the ensuing loop, and most of helix a2, and residues Leu496-Leu502, which are located in the N terminus of helix a5 (Figure 3(d)). Together, these residues comprise a single surface patch, which is conserved in Smg, and matches the region where mutations in either Smg or Vts1 eliminate or reduce RNA binding (Figure 3(e)). This surface is rich in positively charged residues (Arg464, His466, Lys467, Arg499, Arg500 and Lys501) that create both the necessary electrostatic environment for binding to a negatively charged RNA molecule, and provide hydrogen bonding opportunities for specific base recognition (Figure 3(f)). This site is distinct from the putative receptor oligomerization surface of the EphA4 and EphB2 SAM domains,1,2 consistent with the idea that different surfaces of the core SAM domain scaffold can be used for a variety of macromolecular interactions.6 The effect of complex formation on the TCE RNA hairpin was monitored by recording one-dimensional jump-return (JR) 1H and twodimensional 1H­1H JR-NOESY spectra for the 13 nt TCE RNA hairpin in the presence and absence of Vts1 SAM domain (Figure 3(b)). The spectrum of the isolated RNA shows three G and U imino resonances

(black) alone and (red) in 1:1 complex with Vts1. In the free RNA, resonances for G11 and U4 overlap at 13.57 ppm and the resonance for G2 is at 13.44 ppm. Resonances for U4 and G11 shift downfield to 13.70 ppm in the complex, but remain overlapped. New imino resonances appear at 12.5, 11.25, and 11.14 ppm in the complex. The imino resonance of the 5 0 -G in the stem is likely to be broadened due to rapid solvent exchange and may be the broad feature near 12.8 ppm. (c) Chemical shift changes in 1H­15N HSQC spectra upon RNA binding. The combined 1H and 15N chemical shift change, Dd, is determined as Dd2 Z Dd2 C ðgH =gN Þ2 Dd2 , where DdX Z dX;complex KdX;apo and dX and gX are the chemical N H shift (in ppm) and magnetogyric ratio for nucleus X. (d) Chemical shift changes are color-coded onto the surface of Vts1. Green corresponds to DdR3 ppm, white corresponds to DdZ0, and intermediate values are linearly interpolated. (e) Mutations in either Vts1 or Smg that reduce RNA binding are shown in green (Lys461, Arg465, His466, Lys467, Leu498, Ala497), while for comparison, a subset (Thr487, Glu489 and Ala505) of mutations that do not perturb RNA binding are shown in magenta to aid in delineating the RNA binding surface. (f) Electrostatic potential at the surface of the Vts1 SAM domain determined using MOLMOL.17 The orientation of the Vts1 SAM domain is the same in the top panels of (d)­(f); all structures are rotated 1808 in the lower panel.

between 13 ppm and 14 ppm, consistent with formation of the stem. In agreement with this result, MFOLD predicts formation of a stable structure for the stem of the 13 nt TCE. The absence of other imino resonances suggests that the loop is not stably ordered, leading to rapid solvent exchange for the imino protons of the G and U bases in the loop. In the complex, chemical shift perturbations are observed for imino resonances of U4 and G11 in the stem, while new resonances appear between 11 ppm and 12.5 ppm. These results suggest that the Vts1 SAM domain interacts primarily with the nucleotides in the loop, leading to formation of a stable structure. Shift perturbations for residues in the stem may reflect interactions with Vts1 SAM domain or indirect effects of stabilization of the loop. The Vts1 RNA-binding surface determined ° from the chemical shift analysis is w500 A2. Based on the structure of the translational repressor Pumilio-RNA complex,16 this surface area is large enough to interact with three to four nucleotides of the TCE RNA. This estimate is consistent with biochemical evidence and chemical shift perturbations indicating that the Vts1 SAM domain interacts primarily with the loop nucleotides. However, additional interactions with nucleotides in the stem proximal to the loop cannot be excluded based on chemical shift perturbations; consequently, the TCE stem may serve to orient or stabilize the loop for specific recognition. A more detailed picture of Vts1-RNA recognition will emerge from the structure Vts1 SAM domain­RNA complex, with the structure presented here providing an initial framework for RNA recognition by a stand-alone SAM domain. Taken together, the structural and chemical shift mapping results illustrate the versatility of SAM domains in both protein and RNA-recognition. Protein Data Bank accession code Coordinates of Vts1 SAM domain found to the 13nt TCE RNA have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession identifier 2FE9.
