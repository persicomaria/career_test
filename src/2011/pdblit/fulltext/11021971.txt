Background: The process of guanosine 5-diphosphate L-fucose (GDP-L-fucose) biosynthesis is conserved throughout evolution from prokaryotes to man. In animals, GDP-L-fucose is the substrate of fucosyltransferases that participate in the biosynthesis and remodeling of glycoconjugates, including ABH blood group and Lewis-system antigens. The `de novo' pathway of GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis from GDP-D-mannose involves a GDP-D-mannose 4,6 dehydratase (GMD) and a GDP-4-keto-6deoxy-D-mannose epimerase/reductase (GMER). Neither of the catalytic mechanisms nor the three-dimensional structures of the two enzymes has been elucidated yet. The severe leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) type II genetic syndrome is known to result from deficiencies in this de novo pathway. Results: The crystal structures of apo- and holo-GMER have been determined at 2.1 Å and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. Each subunit of the homodimeric (2 × 34 kDa) enzyme is composed of two domains. The N-terminal domain, a six-stranded Rossmann fold, binds NADP+; the C-terminal domain (about 100 residues) displays an / topology. NADP+ interacts with residues Arg12 and Arg36 at the adenylic ribose phosphate; moreover, a protein loop based on the Gly­X­X­Gly­X­X­Gly motif (where X is any amino acid) stabilizes binding of the coenzyme diphosphate bridge. The nicotinamide and the connected ribose ring are located close to residues Ser107, Tyr136 and Lys140, the putative GMER active-site center. Conclusions: The GMER fold is reminiscent of that observed for UDPgalactose epimerase (UGE) from Escherichia coli. Consideration of the enzyme fold and of its main structural features allows assignment of GMER to the reductase­epimerase­dehydrogenase (RED) enzyme homology superfamily, to which short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs) also belong. The location of the NADP+ nicotinamide ring at an interdomain cleft is compatible with substrate binding in the C-terminal domain.

Introduction
a 6-deoxyhexose, is a fundamental component of glycoconjugates in prokaryotes as well as in man. In bacterial cells it is found in polysaccharides of the cell wall and in lipopolysaccharides of some Gram-negative microorganisms, where it is believed to play a central role in pathogenic mechanisms [1]. In animal cells L-fucose is a normal constituent of ABH blood group antigens and of some oligosaccharide structures belonging to the Lewis system, such as LewisX (LeX) and Sialyl LewisX (SLeX). These fucosylated structures are the natural ligands for the cell-surface adhesion molecules, selectins [2]. Fucoserelated biorecognition of leukocyte (S)LeX by endothelial
L-fucose,

E-selectins causes leukocyte rolling and extravasation into tissues, an event that initiates the inflammatory response. A genetically inherited defect in L-fucose metabolism is held to be responsible for the leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LAD II) syndrome, which is characterized by severe immunodeficiency [3]. Qualitative and quantitative alterations of the fucose content in glycoconjugates, both those secreted in biological fluids and those present as cell-surface structures, have been observed to occur in cancer patients. Specifically, an increased fucosylation of cell membrane glycoconjugates has been related to an enhanced metastatic potential via a selectin-mediated mechanism [4]. Thus, metabolism of L-fucose and subsequent

fucosylation processes play a key role in intracellular communication mechanisms and in alterations thereof that lead to many diseases.

Increasing recognition of its biological significance explains the growing attention paid to the elucidation of L-fucose metabolism and to the consequent design of

drugs aimed at interfering with this metabolism. The substrate of fucosyltransferases, which insert L-fucose into glycoconjugates, is GDP-L-fucose (guanosine 5diphosphate L-fucose). This nucleotide diphosphate sugar is formed in the cytoplasm of animal cells; subsequently it reaches the fucosyltransferases located in the lumenal space of the Golgi apparatus by means of a specific antiport system that involves exchange with guanosine 5-monophosphate (GMP) [5]. GDP-L-fucose can be synthesized either via a `salvage' pathway, starting from either externally supplied or recycled L-fucose, which accounts for 10% of the GDP-L-fucose cellular pool [6], or via a prevalent de novo pathway that begins with GDP-D-mannose [7]. The latter pathway involves a GDPD-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and the bifunctional enzyme GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose epimerase/reductase (GMER), which catalyzes both an epimerization, at C3 and C5, and an NADPH-dependent reduction, on C4, which leads to GDP-L-fucose production [7,8] (Figure 1a). Both enzymes have been cloned from bacterial and human cells and their primary structures and kinetic properties have been partly characterized [9,10] (Figure 1b). Moreover, the GMD-catalyzed reaction was identified as the metabolic step affected in the LAD II genetic syndrome [11]. Human GMER proved to be identical to the FX protein, an NADP(H)-binding protein previously purified and partially characterized from human erythrocytes [12]. The enzymatic nature of the human FX protein was suggested by its significant homology with other proteins known to be involved in the metabolism of nucleotide sugars (Figure 1b) and, more specifically, by its homology with the product of the wcaG gene, which is present in the E. coli gene cluster wca that also contains gmd and other genes related to the metabolism of GDP-D-mannose [13]. Recently, the wcaG gene product was obtained as a recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and shown to catalyze the same epimerase/NADPH-dependent reductase reactions as human FX [14]. In order to shed more light on the apparently ubiquitous [15] de novo pathway of GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis, and hence deepen understanding of cell-to-cell communication mechanisms, the recombinant bacterial GMER was crystallized in a trigonal-crystal form following its proteolytic release from the fusion protein [14]. In this communication, we report the X-ray structure of GMER as an apoenzyme and in complex with NADP+ at 2.1 Å and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. We show that the main structural features of GMER are compatible with those recognized in proteins belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/ reductase enzyme homology family [16] and, in more general terms, to enzymes of the reductase­epimerase­ dehydrogenase (RED) superfamily [17,18].

Results
Overall quality of the model

The three-dimensional structure of the apo-enzyme was solved by means of multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) methods, in conjunction with density modification techniques (see Materials and methods section and Tables 1­3). The final model contains 314 residues and 169 solvent molecules; the corresponding R-factor value is 19.2% (Rfree = 26.1%) at 2.1 Å resolution. No interpretable electron density is available for the terminal regions comprising residues 1 and 2 and 317­321. The GMER­NADP+ complex structure has been refined at 2.2 Å resolution, to an R-factor value of 20.2% and Rfree of 28.7%. The refined model contains 314 residues, 109 solvent molecules and one NADP+ molecule. As observed for the apo-enzyme, no electron density is present for the first two and the last five residues in the protein chain. The stereochemistry of both GMER refined models has been assessed with the program PROCHECK [19]: 95% of the residues are in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot and no outliers are present. Moreover, the structure quality check G-function value is 0.0, which is above average for well-refined structures in the same resolution range [19]. Residue 118 has been recognized as cis-proline, as observed for the structurally homologous residue Pro135 in E. coli UDPgalactose epimerase (UGE) [20,21].
Subunit-fold topology

The protein chain contained in the asymmetric unit (one GMER subunit, 321 amino acid residues; ~32 × 37 × 62 Å) builds a compact dimeric species with a crystallographic equivalent molecule through an extended contact interface (described below). Each GMER subunit is arranged in two domains that mostly contain N- and C-terminal residues, respectively. The N-terminal domain exhibits the topology of a doubly wound / open sheet, a modified Rossmann fold, consisting of six parallel  strands and six  helices (Figure 2). In labeling the N-terminal domain / motifs (A­G), the C label has been omitted in order to facilitate structural comparisons with the shortchain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) topology. Thus, the N-terminal Rossmann-fold switch point, where NADP+ is bound, is located between strands A and D, which are effectively the first and third strands in the parallel  sheet, respectively (Figure 2c). The C-terminal domain, which hosts about 100 residues, is composed of three helices (A, C and D) and two (antiparallel) pairs of parallel  strands (A, C and B, D, respectively; secondary structure elements in this domain are primed). The domain is built by three distinct amino acid segments (164­212, 248­283 and 300­316), which originate from  strands F and G and from the 293­300 protein loop terminating the N-terminal-domain

Rossmann fold. Because of such intervening interdomain connections, the F helix falls on the same side of the main  sheet as the A helix, despite being sequentially located after the topological switch point, next to the G strand (Figure 2). Thus, the insertion of one C-terminaldomain loop alleviates the steric restrictions that would be imposed on the F location by the right-handed chirality of  motifs. Finally, the protein C-terminal helix (D, residues 300­316) is snugly accommodated in a semicylindrical elongated cleft defined by both GMER domains. The overall topology displayed by GMER is strongly reminiscent of that observed in UGE [20­23]. The latter enzyme, however, contains a seven-stranded Rossmann fold  sheet because of the insertion of an additional /

unit following  strand B of GMER (Figure 2c). The root mean square deviation (rmsd) calculated over 286 C pairs of GMR and UGE is 2.3 Å (Figure 3a). A sevenstranded parallel  sheet is also found in the Rossmann fold of SDRs, which are essentially devoid of a C-terminal domain [24]. Remarkably, however, in 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [25] and in mouse lung carbonyl reductase [26], amino acid stretches between strands F and G of the Rossmann fold define a small C-terminal lobe that displays -helical structure and, most notably (as in other SDR tertiary structures [16,24­28]), allows the juxtaposition of F onto the proper face of the central  sheet, as described above for GMER. The rmsd calculated over 174 equivalent C pairs of GMER and carbonyl reductase is 3.1 Å (Figure 3b). Concerning topological similarities, it should be noted that the GMER N-terminal domain is structurally related to both the proximal and distal domains of the lac repressor, which are involved in allo-lactose and effector binding (rmsd 2.7 Å over 50 C pairs of the distal domain [29]). Moreover, the GMER N-terminal domain displays evident structural homology to both domains of periplasmic sugarbinding proteins such as the glucose/galactose receptor from Salmonella typhimurium [30]. In this particular case, the structural similarity between the GMER Rossmann fold secondary structure elements and those of the carrier protein N-terminal domain is reflected by an rmsd of 2.8 Å calculated over 93 C pairs (Figure 3c). Moreover, after structure superposition, the periplasmic proteinbound galactose falls about 3 Å away from the site where

the NADP+ nicotinamide ring is observed in holoGMER (i.e. next to the Rossmann fold topological switch point). Such an observation, which can similarly be extended to include the lac-repressor structure and the bound isopropyl--D-thiogalactoside inducer, suggests the existence of a remote common molecular ancestor that evolved into proteins endowed with quite diverse functional properties, all, however, based on hexose recognition. In the absence of three-dimensional structural information it would be impossible to foresee such striking evolutionary relationships.
Quaternary structure and dimer interface

by two salt bridges, which are based on residues Glu134 and Lys145, from the facing subunits. As a result of the twofold axis relationship the C-terminal domain of each subunit is positioned at opposite ends of the dimer, thereby defining a rather wide and open molecular surface around each active site in the assembled dimer (Figure 1a). Remarkably, the same quaternary assembly, based on the D and E helices of the Rossmann fold, can be recognized in the dimeric or tetrameric SDRs 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [25], carbonyl reductase [26], dihydropteridine reductase [27], 7-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [31], 3,20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [32] and biphenyl-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase.
NADP+ conformation and binding site

The symmetrical GMER dimer, built by application of the crystallographic twofold axis, displays the largest contact surface (~1500 Å2) among the intermolecular contacts observed in the crystal packing. On this basis, and considering the strict structural homology with the dimeric UGE (which in its orthorhombic P212121 crystal form displays a full dimer in the asymmetric unit [20]), the GMER crystallographic dimer is taken to represent the stable dimeric species of the enzyme that was observed in solution [14]. Juxtaposition of the two enzyme subunits around the crystallographic twofold axis forms a four-helix -helical bundle that is composed of the most extended  helices in each subunit (D and E, both 22 residues long). The tilted orientation of the bundle helices (~45°) appears to be dictated by ridges-into-grooves packing. In particular, hydrophobic contacts at the helix interface form a remarkable cluster of four methionine residues (Met84, Met85 and their symmetry mates) around the crystallographic twofold axis, in the central part of the bundle. Apart from other intersubunit contacts mediated by apolar residues, the -helical bundle is further stabilized at opposite ends
Figure 4 Stereoview of the GMER NADP+-binding region in the presence of the coenzyme. NADP+ is red, the active-site-triad residues are cyan and the remaining protein atoms are conventionally color-coded. Bound water molecules (W) are shown as green spheres.

The NADP+ coenzyme molecule is bound in an extended conformation at the Rossmann fold topological switch point region, displaying only 164 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface (Figure 4). The dinucleotide adopts an extended conformation at both the adenine (A) and nicotinic (N) ends: the distances AC6­NC2 and P­NN1 are 15.0 Å and 7.5 Å, respectively, in good agreement with the reported values for enzyme-bound NAD(P)+, in which the dinucleotide has an open conformation [33]. The adenine moiety is bound at a location next to the surface of the protein but is shielded on its solvent side by the stacking interaction (4 Å) of the guanidino group of residue Arg36. Remarkably, Arg36 is the residue that is affected most by coenzyme binding, moving from a fully disordered state in the GMER apo-enzyme structure to a defined conformation, parallel to the adenine plane, in the holo-enzyme. In the presence of NADP+, the adenine N1 and N6 atoms are hydrogen-bonded to the Leu41 peptidic N and to the Asn40 ND2 atoms (3.2 Å and

3.0 Å, respectively), whereas the apolar residues Leu41, Leu42 and Ile86 build up the protein side of the adenine pocket. One solvent molecule (W129) provides a hydrogen bond to the adenine N3 atom (2.7 Å). The NADP+ adenosine ribose 2 phosphate is located next to residues Gly10­Gly16 that are provided by the loop connecting A to A and comprise the sequence motif Gly10­X­X­Gly13­X­X­Gly16. It is hydrogen-bonded to the Arg36 NH1 atom (2.5 Å) and to the solvent molecule W107 (3.0 Å; Figures 2 and 4). The Gly­X­X­Gly­X­X­Gly motif is strongly conserved in UGE and related epimerases [23] in the SDR family [16,24,33] and in the RED homology superfamily [17,18] (Figure 1b). Electrostatic compensation of the 2 phosphate group is provided by residues Arg12, from the Gly10­Gly16 motif, and Arg36, from the B­B connection loop. In agreement with structural rules recognized for coenzyme selectivity, both sites host basic residues in SDR enzymes that use NADP+ as a cofactor. The puckered ribose ring is hydrogen-bonded at the 3 OH and 4 O atoms to the peptidic N atoms of residues Gly13 (2.9 Å) and Ala64 (3.4 Å), respectively. Although the dinucleotide diphosphate bridge is located next to the Gly10­Gly16 motif, no direct hydrogen bonds occur between the diphosphate oxygen atoms and residues Arg12 or Arg36. A partial positive charge in this region is, however, provided by the A-helix dipole, which is favourably oriented for compensating the diphosphate negative charges. Additionally, the diphosphate O atoms accept hydrogen bonds from the peptidic N atoms of residues Met14 (2.6 Å) and Val15 (2.7 Å), and they are also hydrogen-bonded to solvent molecules W36 and W123. The nicotinic ribose ring is strongly hydrogen-bonded to protein residues, indicating that this part of the dinucleotide is located at the center of the active-site region. Residues Leu105 and Gly106 may hydrogen bond through their carbonyl O atoms to the nicotinic ribose 2 OH group (3.0 Å and 2.5 Å, respectively); Leu105, together with Val15, builds part of the nicotinic-ribose pocket. On the other hand, both 2 OH and 3 OH ribose groups are hydrogen-bonded to the Lys140 NZ atom (2.8 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively), whereas the 3 OH group forms a strong hydrogen bond with the Tyr146 OH atom (2.8 Å; Figure 4). A very similar NAD(P)+ structural environment, including a lysine­ribose bifurcated hydrogen bond, has been observed in UGE and SDR enzymes for which three-dimensional structures are known. Moreover, a Tyr­X­X­X­Lys motif can be recognized in more than 150 amino acid sequences of SDR and RED enzymes [16­18,23,24,34]. Tyr146 OH, however, is not directly hydrogen-bonded to the Lys140 NZ atom (the 140NZ­146OH distance is 4.0 Å) and is 5.0 Å away from the OG atom of Ser107, the third residue (mostly) conserved in the active-site triad recognized in this enzyme family.

The electron density for the nicotinamide ring is partly undefined, allowing us to assign only the orientation of the aromatic ring (using torsion around the glycosidic bond) but leaving an ambiguity for the assignment of its syn versus anti conformation relative to the ribose (Figure 4). Nevertheless, inspection of the surrounding protein region shows that adoption of the anti conformation would bring about unacceptable steric clashes of the carboxamide atoms with residues Pro163, Leu166 and Met217. Other apolar residues that together form a sort of nicotinamide protein pocket are Met14, Val15, Leu105, and Val214. On the basis of the above considerations Figure 4 shows the nicotinamide ring in the syn conformation, which is compatible with a hydrogen-bonding interaction between the carboxamide group and residue His179. Overall, 57 van der Waals contacts (<3.6 Å) are observed between the bound coenzyme and GMER.
The C-terminal domain

The refined models of both apo- and holo-GMER show that the C-terminal domain displays a wide surface cleft that is defined by all the secondary structure elements present in this part of the molecule. In particular, the three helices A, C and D form a sort of threecomponent helical bundle that supports the  structure and the elongated protein loops surrounding the cleft (Figures 2ab and 5). The structural overlay of holo-GMER and UGE (in its complex with uridine 5-diphosphate-glucose [UDPglucose] -- PDB code 1xel; Figures 3a and 5) shows that in the two enzymes the protein regions encompassing the C-terminal domain display large deviations in their -structure elements, despite maintaining a thorough coincidence of the intervening  helices. The deviations along the C-terminal  strands can be as high as 10 Å. Apart from reflecting amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions in the C-terminal part of the the two sequences (Figure 1b), the cleft structure may reflect different substrate specificities in the two enzymes as well as conformational adaptation of UGE induced by the UDP conjugates present in all crystal structures so far reported [20­23,35,36]. Indeed, a uridine-nucleotide-induced conformational change, enhancing the chemical reactivity of NAD+, has been recognized in UGE complexes [37,38]. Moreover, calculation of an evolutionary tree [39] based explicitly on amino acid sequences of only the C-terminal half of epimerase and epimerase/reductase enzymes structurally related to GMER shows that the two enzyme subfamilies are clearly clustered in distinct evolutionary branches (data not shown).

active site of GMER was analysed. A molecular model of GDP-L-fucose was built from molecular fragments recovered from the PDB (codes 1abf and 1tag), and was superposed on the active-site-bound UDP-glucose observed in the related UGE crystal structure [23]. Subsequently, the UGE­GDP-L-fucose complex was overlayed on the holo-GMER structure on the basis of 286 C pairs. Such model overlays, and the linked atomic coordinates transformations, thus allow the GDP-L-fucose model to be transferred into the GMER active site, in keeping with the stereochemical evidence provided by the homologous UGE­UDP-glucose complex. Figure 6 shows an overall view of the active-site region in the resulting enzyme­product model.

Although the holo-GMER­GDP-L-fucose adduct model must be validated by future experiments, some general observations can be drawn. The overall substrate- or product-binding site has the shape of an elongated funnel. The GDP-L-fucose extended conformation fits the activesite region without serious steric collisions. The guanosine part of the nucleotide sugar is located in the upper part of the C-terminal domain cleft, in a region that is rather exposed to solvent. Potential guanine-recognition residues are Asn177, Ser178 and Arg187. The guanosine ribose finds potential recognition residues at Arg209 and Lys283; the latter may compensate for the negative charge(s) in the nucleotide diphosphate bridge as well. The helix A dipole may also play such an electrostatic role, whereas

residue Asn165 may provide diphosphate hydrogen-bonding interactions. In the GDP-L-fucose-binding region the L-fucose ring is positioned next to Ser107, Ser108, Cys109, Asn133, Tyr136 and His179 (Figures 6 and 7). Remarkably, the model-building procedure adopted, which was based simply on the overall structural homology between GMER and UGE molecules, brings the C4 atom of L-fucose (reduced during the GMER catalytic cycle) close to the nicotinamide ring, which, according to the present crystal structure and enzyme­product model, may approach fucose with its B face. Although no independent information is available on the stereospecifcity of the NADPH/substrate hydride transfer reaction in GMER, hydride transfer to the nicotinamide B face during the catalytic cycle has been proposed for UGE [21,22].
Implications for the GMER catalytic mechanism

Moreover, in UGE, Ser124 may act as a proton conductor between the substrate and tyrosinate149, the latter representing the driving residue in the process [40]. The conservation of very similar active-site triads in GMER and UGE supports the idea that similar, although non-identical, functions are served by Ser107, Tyr136 and Lys140 in GMER. In fact, reduction of 4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose, by transfer of a hydride ion from NADPH to the substrate C4 atom in GMER, requires the concerted transfer of a proton to the hexose reduced center. Remarkably, the Ser107 sidechain is spatially close to residues Ser108 and Cys109, both of which face the proposed hexose-binding pocket (Figure 7). A cysteinyl residue at position 109 is shared by the human erythrocyte FX protein (Figure 1b). We also note that a sort of `protein channel' opens to the solvent next to residues Thr132 and Asn133 (the latter also faces the hexose pocket). Replacement of Ser132 with Asn has been reported for the tum­ mutants of the homologous mouse tumor rejection antigen protein P35B [41]. Finally, the conservation of the NAD(P)+ conformation in GMER and UGE, as well as of local hydrogen bonds such as those involving Tyr136, Lys140 and the nicotinamide ribose in GMER (Tyr149 and Lys153 in UGE), highlights a possible secondary role for the active-site-triad residues in defining the coenzyme conformation as well as in fixing the productive location of NADP(H) relative to substrate. The modeling analysis of product recognition presented here for GMER is in agreement with such an observation. The present data allow only limited insight into the epimerase catalytic function of GMER. In fact, modeling and structural inference on the basis of the information available for UGE cannot be applied to GMER because of the quite different epimerization processes catalyzed by the two enzymes. In the case of UGE, the epimerization at the galactosyl C4 atom is based on a substrate-toNAD+ hydride transfer (leading to the 4-ketopyranose

The structural analysis reported here shows that the Ser,Tyr,Lys active-site triad first identified in SDR enzymes [16,34] is present and properly structured in GMER. Pairwise comparisons show that the GMER active-site-triad residues overlay with an rmsd of 0.33 Å when compared to those of UGE [23]. The amino acid sequence alignments shown in Figure 1b allow one to extend similar considerations to the homologous proteins FX (human) and GMD, the E. coli dehydratase preceding GMER in the GDP-L-fucose biosynthetic pathway. The functional and site-directed mutagenesis studies conducted on UGE have shown, in agreement with parallel analyses of SDR enzymes, that the catalytic lysine residue plays an essential electrostatic role in stabilizing the tyrosinate form of the active-site tyrosine, the pKa of which drops by about 4 units (pKa ~6.1) in comparison to a free tyrosine [40]. Thus, both serine and tyrosine residues have been proposed to be involved in enzyme­ substrate proton exchange, acting as catalysts in the coenzyme­substrate hydride double exchange required for the galactose  glucose epimerization reaction [37,38,40].

intermediate), followed by rotation of the hexose ring in the active site and by the NADH-based reduction of the C4 center to yield the C4 epimer (i.e. UDP-glucose) [35,36]. In GMER, two carbon atoms (C3 and C5) of the 4-ketopyranose substrate undergo the epimerization reaction, whereas substrate reduction occurs at C4 (Figure 1a). In the absence of detailed kinetic analysis of the GMERcatalysed reaction, and on the basis of simple structural considerations, a non-enzymatic mechanism for the epimerization reactions at C3 and C5 cannot be excluded.

(oxidoreductases, isomerases and lyases). Remarkably, a three-dimensional protein scaffold reminiscent of the GMER N-terminal domain is observed in non-enzymatic proteins broadly involved in sugar metabolism, such as the lactose repressor and the bacterial periplasmic galactose-binding protein. With regard to the GMER catalytic mechanism, the conserved active-site structure, including residues Ser107, Tyr136, Lys140, and the observed coenzyme-binding mode are in keeping with an acid/base catalytic assistance being provided by Ser107/Tyr136 during the NADPH-dependent hexose C4 reduction process.

Biological implications
The correct establishment of cell-surface oligosaccharide structures or antigens, such as those of the ABH blood groups and leukocyte Sialyl LewisX is dependent on the availability of GDP-activated L-fucose. GDP-4keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose epimerase/reductase (GMER) is the last enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway yielding GDP-L-fucose, the substrate of fucosyl transferases. Dysfunctions within this biosynthetic pathway are responsible for leukocyte adhesion defect syndrome (type II), a genetic disease associated with severe immunodeficiency in man. No three-dimensional structural information has been reported so far for any of the enzymes in this biosynthetic pathway. Most remarkably, from a structural viewpoint, the last two enzymes in this pathway, GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GMER, share 25% amino acid identity and are colocated within the same E. coli gene cluster. GMER is a dimeric enzyme (2 × 321 amino acids) displaying a subunit structure comprised of two domains. The N-terminal domain has the topology of a sixstranded Rossmann fold, and it binds the NADP+ coenzyme. The C-terminal domain (~100 residues) displays an / topology and defines a wide surface cleft, the size and shape of which are strikingly compatible with those of the enzyme substrate. GMER has an active-site Ser,Tyr,Lys triad that has also been observed in UDPgalactose epimerase (UGE) and in the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) homology family. The three residues are believed to be responsible for the catalytic activity in the SDR family, although their evolutionary conservation is not absolute. The above structural considerations allow GMER (together with UGE) to be assigned to the reductase­epimerase­dehydrogenase (RED) protein homology superfamily, which, apart from the short-chain dehydrogenases, includes mediumsized enzymes such as GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, the human erythrocyte protein FX, Nolk (a nodulation factor in Azorhizobium caulinodans), the murine tumor rejection antigen protein P35B, the protochlorophyllide reductases and dihydroflavonol reductases. Thus, the GMER homologs include proteins belonging to at least three different enzymatic families

Materials and methods
Crystallization
GMER used for crystallization was overexpressed and purified to homogeneity as previously described [14]. Crystals of GMER from E. coli were grown by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique from 1.5 M lithium sulfate, 0.1 M MES buffer, pH 6.5, at 20°C with a protein concentration of 16 mg/ml, as reported elsewhere [14]. GMER crystals belong to the trigonal space group P3221 with unit-cell dimensions a = b = 105.0 Å, c = 75.6 Å,  = 120.0°, and they contain one enzyme subunit (34 kDa) per asymmetric unit, with a volume solvent content of 64%. Crystals of the GMER­NADP+ complex were obtained by co-crystallization using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique. Droplets containing 0.75 M lithium sulfate, 0.005 M NADP+, 0.05 M MES buffer, pH 6.5, with a protein concentration of 16 mg/ml, were equilibrated against the same solution employed for crystallization of the free enzyme described above. The resulting crystals were isomorphous to the apo-enzyme crystals.

Data collection and structure determination
All X-ray diffraction datasets were collected on a Rigaku Raxis II imageplate system, using Cu K radiation. Diffraction data used for MIR phasing were collected at room temperature, whereas those employed for refinement of the apo-enzyme and of the complex with NADP+ were collected on flash-cooled crystals. In the latter cases, crystals were transferred for a few seconds in a solution containing 1.5 M lithium sulfate, 0.1 M MES buffer, pH 6.5, and 15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant, mounted on a thread loop and flash-frozen at 120K under a nitrogen stream. Diffracted intensities were evaluated and integrated using the program MOSFLM [42], whereas the CCP4 suite was used for data reduction [43]. Table 1 gives a summary of the data-collection statistics. The soaking time for the two derivatives was 48 hours in the case of PCMBS (p-chloromercuri-benzen sulfonate; saturated solution) and 12 hours in the case of KAu(CN)2 (0.005 M). The PCMBS isomorphous difference Patterson map was solved using the program SHELX-90 [44]. The SIRAS (single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering) phases thus obtained were used to locate the Au-binding sites by difference Fourier techniques. The heavy-atom parameters were refined using the program MLPHARE [45]. The anomalous signal of the mercury derivative was used to solve the space group enantiomorph ambiguity (P3121 versus P3221). Phasing statistics are reported in Table 2. The MIRAS (multiple isormorphous replacement with anomalous scattering) phases were improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching using the program DM [46]. The resulting electron density showed several secondary-structure elements, but did not allow a complete chain tracing. A phased molecular replacement search was performed with the program ESSENS [47], using the polyalanine truncated N-terminal domain of UGE [23] as a search model. A clear solution was promptly obtained. In contrast, several trials employing the full UGE model (either as an intact molecule or as a polyalanine truncated form) failed to provide a clear solution. The O package [48], with the BATON option, was used for the model-building stage, allowing a polyalanine chain comprising about 85% of the protein backbone to be traced.

Crystallographic refinement of the apo-enzyme
The crystallographic refinement was carried out at 2.1 Å resolution using the program TNT [49] and the Engh­Huber stereochemical parameters [50]. A random sample containing 1045 reflections was excluded from the refinement and used for the calculation of the free R factor [51]. The initial model was subjected to 20 cycles of rigidbody refinement in the 10.0­3.0 Å resolution range, lowering the R factor and Rfree to 41.0% and 47.3%, respectively. Subsequently, a series of atomic coordinates restrained refinement cycles was carried out, alternated with rebuilding sessions, until the crystallographic R factor fell to 32%, and the free R factor to 43.0%. The corresponding electron density allowed sequence identification, and all sidechains were inserted in the model. Additional refinement cycles, including individual isotropic restrained B factors, were performed until convergence was reached. Water molecules were added at positions with density >3 in the 2Fo­2Fc map, taking into consideration only peaks engaged in at least one H bond with a protein or a solvent atom. The last series of positional restrained and isotropic restrained B factor refinement cycles yielded a final R factor of 19.2% and a free R factor of 26.1%. The current model contains 2479 amino acid residues and 169 water molecules. The first two and the last five residues in the protein chain are not defined in the electron density. The average B factors for the 2479 protein atoms and for the 169 ordered water molecules are 28.8 Å2 (26.2 Å2 for the mainchain and 31.5 Å2 for the sidechains) and 32.3 Å2, respectively (see Table 3).

Crystallographic refinement of the NADP+ complex
The crystallographic refinement was performed in the 15.0­2.2 Å resolution range, excluding 1100 randomly chosen reflections for the the free R factor calculation. The initial R factor, calculated with the refined coordinates of the apo-enzyme, was 34.4% at 2.2 Å resolution. Initial rigid-body refinement (using TNT) in the 15.0­3.0 Å resolution range resulted in a drop of the R factor and Rfree to 30.3% and 39.5%, respectively. The entire model was then subjected to a series of restrained positional refinement cycles until convergence was reached at an R factor of 25.5% and an Rfree of 31.5% in the 15.0­2.2 Å resolution range. Solvent molecules were then added following the same selection criteria described above. Inspection of the electron-density maps at this stage showed the presence of an NADP+ molecule, bound at the N-terminal domain, which was modeled based on 3Fo­2Fc and 2Fo­2Fc electron-density maps. Five cycles of individual isotropic restrained B-factor refinement and ten cycles of positionally restrained refinement brought to convergence at R-factor and Rfree values of 20.2% and 28.7%, respectively, in the 15.0­2.2 Å resolution range. The final model consists of 2479 protein atoms (314 residues), 109 water molecules and one NADP + molecule. The average B factors for the protein atoms are 27.5 Å2 (24.0 Å2 for the mainchain and 31.0 Å2 for the sidechains) and 28.1 Å2 for the solvent atoms. Only a part of the nicotinamide ring of the NADP+ molecule is defined in the electron-density map; the C3, C4, C5 atoms and the entire carboxamide moiety are disordered. All the remaining atoms of the NADP+ molecule have refined B factors within the 10.0­33.0 Å2 range. Details of the refinement are reported in Table 3.
