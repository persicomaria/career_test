Abstract In mammals, sulfonation as mediated by specific cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) plays an important role in the homeostasis of dopamine and other catecholamines. To gain insight into the structural basis for dopamine recognition/binding, we determined the crystal structure of a mouse dopamine-sulfating SULT, mouse SULT1D1 (mSULT1D1). Data obtained indicated that mSULT1D1 comprises of a single a/b domain with a five-stranded parallel b-sheet. In contrast to the structure of the human SULT1A3 (hSULT1A3)-dopamine complex previously reported, molecular modeling and mutational analysis revealed that a water molecule plays a critical role in the recognition of the amine group of dopamine by mSULT1D1. These results imply differences in substrate binding between dopamine-sulfating SULTs from different species. Ó 2008 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) in mammals play important roles in the homeostasis of catecholamine neurotransmitters and steroid/thyroid hormones as well as in the detoxification of xenobiotics [1,2]. SULTs utilize 3 0 -phosphoadenosine 5 0 -phosphosulfate (PAPS) as the sulfonate donor to catalyze the sulfonation of substrate compounds, yielding 3 0 -phosphoadenosine 5 0 -phosphate (PAP) and sulfonate conjugates. We have previously cloned a cDNA encoding the mouse SULT1D1 (mSULT1D1) and succeeded in the bacterial expression of the recombinant enzyme [3]. Subsequently, mSULT1D1 was identified as a catecholamine-metabolizing enzyme involved in the sulfonation of catecholamines in mouse [4]. An orthologous SULT1D1 has also been identified in dog (designated cSULT1D1) [5], where it appeared to work in a fashion similar to that in mouse. Between mSULT1D1 and

cSULT1D1, there is a 81% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1). A site-directed mutation study of cSULT1D1 showed that Asp247 is strongly involved in dopamine recognition [6]; however, interestingly, although a SULT1D pseudogene has been detected in human genome [7], a corresponding SULT1D1 has not been identified in human. Instead of SULT1D1, it appears that catecholamines such as dopamine are sulfonated by hSULT1A3, which is present in human but not in mouse or dog. The functionally similar mSULT1D1 displays 58% amino acid sequence identity with hSULT1A3 (Fig. 1). The crystal structure of hSULT1A3 in complex with dopamine has been determined and the structure shows that Glu146 and Asp86 interact with the amine group of dopamine [8]. These two acidic amino acid residues, however, are not conserved in mSULT1D1 which carries Ile86 and Ala146 at corresponding positions (Fig. 1). In addition to their possible differential physiological involvements, such interspecies differences in SULTs may have important implications in pharmaceutics. In drug discovery, animal experiments using mice are routinely conducted to investigate preclinical pharmacokinetics of candidate drugs. It is therefore an important issue to learn about drug-metabolizing enzymes, including SULTs, that are commonly found in both human and mouse as well as those that are uniquely present in mouse such as mSULT1D1. To understand the structural basis for dopamine recognition/binding by mSULT1D1, we determined the crystal structure of mSULT1D1, carried out docking analysis with dopamine, and generated and characterized mSULT1D1 mutants with changes at a critical amino acid residue. In this communication, we demonstrate how dopamine may bind to the substrate-binding site of mSULT1D1 and reveal the structural basis of mSULT1D1-catalyzed sulfonation reaction.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Purification and crystallization mSULT1D1, expressed using the pGEX-2TK glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system, was purified from transformed Escherichia coli BL21 cells based on the procedure established previously [3]. Crystallization was carried out at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Purified mSULT1D1 was adjusted to 8 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 5 mM PAP. After mixing mSULT1D1 and reservoir solutions (16% PEG 10, 000, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 100 mM Bis­Tris, pH 5.5) in a 1:1 ratio, crystals were grown for three days.

Residues implicated in the catalytic mechanism are shown in blue. Underlined residues represent a significant structurally different region between mSULT1D1 and hSULT1A3 (colored area). Substrate recognition residues are highlighted in red. 2.2. Data collection A single crystal was transferred from the mother liquor to a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 150 mM NaCl, 16% PEG 10,000, 5 mM PAP, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM Bis­Tris, pH 5.5, and 25% glycerol. The crystal was mounted on a cryo-loop, and flash-cooled with a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K using a cryosystem (Rigaku). X-ray diffraction data were collected using Jupiter 210 (Rigaku/MSC Corpora° tion) and the synchrotron radiation (0.750 A wavelength) at the beamline BL38B1 of Spring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). Diffraction data were processed using the program package HKL2000 [9]. The crystal was found to belong to the space group C2. The unit cell parameters were ° ° ° a = 155.8 A, b = 67.6 A, c = 42.7 A, b = 105.6°. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. 2.3. Structure determination and refinement The crystal structure of mSULT1D1 was determined by molecular replacement using Molrep [10]. The structure of mSULT1E1 (mouse estrogen sulfotransferase; Protein Data Bank accession entry 1AQY [11]) was used as the searching model. The mSULT1D1 structure was built automatically using ARP/wARP [12], and manually modified using the Coot program [13]. Several iterative rounds of model building were performed in Coot and refined using Refmac5 [14]. Finally, 458 water molecules were located and included in the refinement. Rfactor and Rfree values for the structure were 14.8% and 16.0%, respectively. The quality of the structures was evaluated using PROCHECK [15]. All statistics for refinement are given in Table 1. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2ZPT. 2.4. Modeling of mSULT1D1­dopamine complex structures A molecular model of mSULT1D1­PAP­dopamine complex was constructed using Coot and MOE (2006.08; Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada). Dopamine was placed into the substrate-binding pocket of mSULT1D1 based on superposition with reported hSULT1A3-dopamine complex structure. After all water molecules in the structure were deleted, energy minimization was performed using MOE. All protein atoms and PAP were fixed during the minimization. Upon completion of the procedure, we compared the minimized position of dopamine and the positions of nine bound water molecules in the substrate-binding site of the crystal structure of mSULT1D1. The three water molecules (Wat1, Wat2, and Wat3 as shown in Fig. 3A) did not overlap with dopamine and could interact with it. The second energy minimization step was performed for the modeling of mSULT1D1­PAP­dopamine and the three water molecules using MOE with fixed positions of the three water molecules, mSULT1D1, PAP. Alternatively, the same procedure was carried out without fixing the positions of the residues which constituted substrate-binding site. 2.5. Generation, expression and purification of mutant mSULT1D1 Mutagenic primers encoding a single amino acid change (from Glu247 to Leu247, Ala247 or Asp247) were synthesized and used in the PCR-amplification of mutated mSULT1D1 cDNAs. Each reaction mixture contained 10 ng of pGEX-2TK harboring wild-type mSULT1D1 cDNA, 0.2 lM primers, 200 lM of each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 1 · Phusion HF buffer, and 2 units of Phusion DNA polymerase. For PCR amplification, thirty cycles were carried out with denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 60 °C for 10 s, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The resulting PCR product was treated with Dpn I for 1 h at 37 °C followed by transformation into JM109 E. coli cells. pGEX-2TK harboring mutated mSULT1D1 cDNA was isolated from transformed JM109 cells and subjected to nucleotide sequencing using a BECKMAN COULTER CEQ2000XL DNA sequencer. For the expression of mutated SULT1D1, pGEX-2TK harboring mutated mSULT1D1 cDNA was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells and recombinant protein was purified based on the procedure established previously [3]. 2.6. Enzymatic assay The sulfonating activity of wild-type as well as mutated mSULT1D1 was assayed using PAP[35S] as the sulfonate donor. The standard assay mixture, with a final volume of 25 ll, contained 50 mM HEPESNaOH buffer (pH 7.0), 0.5 lM PAP[35S] (45 Ci/mmol), and 50 lM dopamine. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme, allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C, and terminated by heating at 100 °C for 2 min. The precipitates formed were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to the analysis of [35S] sulfonated product using a previously developed thin-layer chromatography separation procedure [16], with n-butanol/isopropanol/formic acid/water (3:1:1:1; by volume) as the solvent system. Afterwards, the plates were air-dried and analyzed using a fluoro image analyzer (FLA-3000G).

ported for SULT structures (Table 1). A clear electron density map of PAP, water molecules, and residues of mSULT1D1 was observed (Fig. 3A). The overall structure of mSULT1D1 comprises a single a/b domain with a five-stranded parallel b sheet that constitutes the PAPS-binding site and catalytic center (Fig. 2). A strand­loop­helix motif containing the PSBloop (45-TYPKSGTT-52) forms specific hydrogen bonds with the 5 0 -phosphate of the PAP molecule. The 3 0 -phosphate of the co-crystallized PAP molecule interacts with two conserved regions of mSULT1D1, residues Arg130 and Ser138 in PB motif and residues 257-RKG-259 [11]. It is likely that mSULT1D1 catalyzes an in-line sulfuryl transfer reaction in a manner similar to other SULT enzymes [17]. The amino acids His108 and Lys48 of mSULT1D1 are in positions to assist in deprotonation of the acceptor hydroxyl group and dissociation of the sulfonate group from PAPS, as has been proposed for other SULT enzymes [17]. Thus, these structural features and reaction mechanisms appear to be well conserved in all SULTs. 3.2. Structural comparison The crystal structure of mSULT1D1 is highly similar to that of hSULT1A3 in complex with dopamine [8]. mSULT1D1 shares 58% amino acid sequence identity with hSULT1A3 (Fig. 1). Superposition of mSULT1D1 with hSULT1A3 ° resulted in a root-mean-square deviation of 0.839 A (encompassing all 287 structurally characterized Ca atoms of

mSULT1D1: 10­293). Some differences, however, were observed in the main chains around residues 20­38 and 83­91, as shown in blue and yellow, respectively (Fig. 2). These two regions form part of the substrate-binding site. Fig. 3B shows the superposition of the dopamine-binding sites of hSULT1A3 (yellow for carbon) and mSULT1D1 (blue for carbon). Catalytic residues Lys48, Lys106, and His108 are completely conserved not only in the primary sequence but also in the 3-D structure. Lys106 is completely conserved for all members of the SULT1 subfamily and may have an important role, especially for phenol sulfonation. Residues Phe142 and Phe81 sandwich the aromatic ring of the phenol substrate. Phe142 is also completely conserved for all SULTs. On the other hand, Phe81 is conserved in SULT1A, SULT1C, and SULT1D subfamilies, and the corresponding residue is Tyr in members of the SULT1E subfamily and Met in members of the SULT1B subfamily. In members of all SULT1 subfamilies, these two residues could sandwich the aromatic ring and may have a major role in phenol recognition. In Fig. 3B, the catalytic residues (Lys48, His108, and Lys106) and two phenylalanine residues (Phe81 and Phe142) are structurally conserved, whereas the right side is structurally variable (residues 21, 24, 84, 86, 146, 148, and 247). The right side is an important region that determines differences in substrate specificity among these enzymes, because this area is structurally different from those of other SULT1 structures (SULT1E1 [11] and SULT1A1 [18]). 3.3. Molecular modeling of mSULT1D1 in complex with dopamine and mutational analysis Our repeated trials by co-crystallization or soaking with dopamine failed to yield the crystals of mSULT1D1-dopamine complex. We therefore decided to model the position of the dopamine based on the location of dopamine in the hSULT1A3 structure. The hSULT1A3­PAP­dopamine complex structure showed that the amine group of dopamine forms

electrostatic interactions with residues Glu146 and Asp86 (orange dashed line in Fig. 3B) [8]. The distance between the amine nitrogen atom of dopamine and the oxygen atom of ° ° Glu146 and Asp86 residues was 3.0 A and 3.4 A, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that residues Glu146 and Asp86 in hSULT1A3 are important in determining substrate specificity for dopamine [19­24]. The corresponding residues are Ala146 and Ile86 in mSULT1D1, and these residues are not suitable for electrostatic interactions with the amine group of dopamine. We first attempted to generate a docking model of the mSULT1D1­PAP structure with dopamine based on superposition of the dopamine molecule from the crystal structure of the hSULT1A3­PAP­dopamine complex. We performed the energy minimization with and without fixing the residues which constitute substrate-binding site to allow for possible conformational changes of the residues upon dopamine binding. Interestingly, identical structures were obtained with and without fixing the residues. In the docking model of mSULT1D1 with dopamine, the amine group of dopamine flips and inserts between a water molecule (designed Wat2:b-

° factor 11.9 A2) and Glu247. In this arrangement, the amine ° group is 2.7 and 2.6 A from Wat2 and Glu247, respectively (Fig. 3B). Such an arrangement is similar to the sandwich-like electrostatic interactions found with Glu146 and Asp86 in the hSULT1A3­dopamine complex structure. In mSULT1D1, the Wat2 molecule forms interaction with the main chain amido nitrogen atom of Ile148 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Glu247. By superimposing the modeled dopamine into ° substrate-binding site of the 1.15 A mSULT1D1 structure we determined, the electron density of water molecules (designed Wat4 and Wat5) overlap with the position of the amine group and the hydroxyl group of modeled dopamine, respectively (Fig. 3A). These data provide support for the proposed positions of amine group and hydroxyl group of modeled dopamine. The aromatic ring and aminoethyl group of modeled dopamine are surrounded by many hydrophobic residues (Phe21, Ile24, Phe81, Leu84, Phe142, and Ile148) as well as Ala146 and Ile86 (which correspond to Glu146 and Asp86 in hSULT1A3). These hydrophobic residues form a substratebinding pocket with specificity for dopamine. It is noted that the position of Ile148 causes steric clash with the initial posi-

tion of the amine group of dopamine. This effect could be important to place the amine group of dopamine in a suitable position. Overall, the docking model structure indicated Glu247 and Wat2 molecule might contribute to the recognition of amine group of dopamine. To verify the contribution of Glu247 and Wat2 to the recognition of the amine group of dopamine, we measured enzymatic activities of wild-type mSULT1D1 and three mutants (E247L, E247A and E247D) with dopamine as substrate. Results showed that mutant E247L, E247A, and E247D displayed, respectively, 36%, 94%, and 120% relative activity compared with the wild-type mSULT1D1 (Fig. 4). That mutant E247A showed only a small decrease in enzymatic activity may suggest that Glu247 makes little contribution in interaction with the amine group of dopamine. Therefore, the Wat2 molecule appears to be a dominant contributor to the recognition of the amine group of dopamine. When Glu247 in mSULT1D1 was mutated to a more bulky hydrophobic residue Leu, the mutated enzyme still retained 36% activity of that exhibited by wild-type mSULT1D1. The decrease in activity for E247L mutant is likey due to steric clash. These activity data of E247L and E247D mutants are also consistent with those derived from site-directed mutagenesis experiments using cSULT1D1 [6]. Collectively, the above-mentioned results suggest that the Wat2 molecule, but not Glu247, plays an important role in the recognition of the amine group of dopamine. In conclusion, the results from the molecular modeling and mutational analysis indicate that the amine group of dopamine is recognized by the substrate-binding site of mSULT1D1 via the interaction with the Wat2 water molecule. This finding is in contrast to the case with SULT1A3 where Glu146 and Asp86 have been demonstrated to be involved in the recognition of the amine group of dopamine. It therefore appears that dopamine-sulfating SULTs from different mammalian species may employ different mechanisms for substrate binding/recognition.
