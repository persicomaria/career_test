ABSTRACT Phosphatidylglycerophosphatase (PGPase), an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, catalyzes formation of phosphatidylglycerol from phosphatidylglycerophosphate. Phosphatidylglycerol is a multifunctional phospholipid, found in the biological membranes of many organisms. Here, we report the crystal structure of Listeria monocytogenes PGPase at 1.8 Å resolution. PGPase, an allhelical molecule, forms a homotetramer. Each protomer contains an independent active site with two metal ions, Ca2 and Mg2 , forming a heterobinuclear center located in a hydrophilic cavity near the surface of the molecule. The binuclear center, conserved ligands, metal-bound water molecules, and an Asp­His dyad form the active site. The catalytic mechanism of this enzyme is likely to proceed via binuclear metal activated nucleophilic water. The binuclear metal-binding active-site environment of this structure should provide insights into substrate binding and metal-dependent catalysis. A long channel with inter-linked linear water chains, termed "proton wires," is observed at the tetramer interface. Comparison of similar water chain structures in photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs), Cytochrome f, gramicidin, and bacteriorhodopsin, suggests that PGPase may conduct protons via proton wires.

Key words: binuclear metal site; lipid metabolism; phosphatase; proton wires; PGPase INTRODUCTION Formation of phosphatidylglycerol from phosphatidylglycerophosphate is catalyzed by phosphatidylglycerophosphatase (EC 3.1.3.27; PGPase), a membrane-associated enzyme. It is involved in lipid metabolism, is specific for phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and does not catalyze hydrolysis of other simple phosphomonoesters. PGPase requires Mg2 for activity and is inhibited by sulfhydryl agents and freezing/thawing.1,2 Phospholipids, essential for cell and organelle barrier function, also serve as matrix for membrane-associated enzymes and complexes. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is a ubiquitous phospholipid, found in the biological membranes of many organisms. As the

principal anionic membrane phospholipid, PG makes up roughly 20% of total phospholipid in actively growing cells and turns over rapidly in vivo. In plants, phosphatidylglycerol is primarily present in thylakoid membranes and has been suggested to play specific roles in photosynthesis.3 In addition to serving as a membrane matrix, phospholipids contribute to synthesis of various surface molecules. Specifically, PG serves as a precursor for various cellular metabolites (i.e., cardiolipin),4 outer membrane lipoproteins, such as the major murein lipoprotein,5 and membrane-derived oligosaccharides.6 It is also required for SecA-dependent translocation of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane.7,8 Escherichia coli predominantly contains glycerophospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin, but lacks phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, or sphingomyelin. The inner membrane is a glycerophospholipid bilayer, within which the cytoplasmic surface serves as the site of biosynthesis of all membrane lipids and proteins.9 Glycerophospholipids also make up the inner surface of the cellular outer membrane, but the outer surface of the outer membrane consists of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide, a glucosamine-based phospholipid unique to Gram-negative bacteria. PG is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol in two steps. Phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) is first synthesized by transfer of the phosphatidyl backbone from CDPdiacylglycerol to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate.10 PGP is then rapidly dephosphorylated by PGPase giving PG. Under normal circumstances, PGP does not accumulate, which suggests that regulation of acidic phospholipid biosynthesis occurs before the phosphatase catalyzed step.11 pgpA and pgpB encode phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) phosphatase activity in E. coli.12 But neither pgpA nor pgpB of E. coli is essential for PGPase activity, and there is

evidence for the third one.13 PGPase is located in both the outer and cytoplasmic membranes.14 To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of PGPase activity, we determined the crystal structure of a putative PGPase from Listeria monocytogenes at 1.8 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography (Table I). A 20 kDa protein (Gene bank id AAC98898, SwissProt id Q928N5) encoded by ltrc and annotated as low temperature requirement C protein was selected by the New York Structural GenomiX Research Consortium (NYSGXRC; http://www.nysgrc.org). A PSI/PHI BLAST search identified 10 homologs (E value 0.002) with conserved phosphatidylglycerophosphatase A (PgpA) domains. A multiple sequence alignment is shown in Figure 1. Our structure determination shares 67% and 60% sequence identity with phosphatidylglycerophosphatase A (EC 3.1.3.27) from Bacillus clausii and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, respectively, indicating that the protein is almost certainly a phosphatidylglycerophosphatase A (PGPase). This group of proteins, which includes low-temperature requirement C protein, various PGPases, and conserved hypothetical proteins could not be modeled based on sequence homology to any of the threePROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

dimensional structures known at the time the target was selected by the NYSGXRC. Here, we report the crystal structure of the putative PGPase from L. monocytogenes. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of this protein reveals a likely biochemical function and provides clues as to its catalytic mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning The target gene was amplified via PCR from L. monocytogenes genomic DNA with the appropriate forward (GTAGAAAAACAAAGTGCCTTAGAATC) and reverse (CATTAACGATGTCGTCGTGATAAC) primers and Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) using standard methods. Following gel purification, the PCR product was inserted into a modified pET26b vector for topoisomerase directed cloning (Invitrogen) and designed to express the protein of interest followed by a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. Transformation into BL21 (DE3) cells, followed by incubation (37°C for 60 min) yielded a culture which was plated onto LB/ kanamycin and held at 37°C overnight. Twelve colonies were selected into microtiter wells containing 50 L of

LB/kanamycin. The solutions appeared turbid after 4 hr and diagnostic PCR using a T7 sequencing primer and gene-specific reverse primer was conducted to confirm clones with the correct orientation. Preparations exhibiting the correct orientation were then used for DNA miniprepping. Expression and Solubility Testing Samples from three transformed colonies were picked into 1.2 mL LB/kanamycin in a 96-well deep-well dish ("Plate 1"). After 6 hr of shaking at 37°C, 50 L of each culture were transferred to a microtiter plate. To each well was added 50 L of LB/kanamycin with 30% glycerol for the purpose of frozen archiving. Two microliters (2 L) of each culture from "Plate 1" were transferred to 200 L of ZYP-5052/kanamycin medium in a 96-well deep-well dish. This plate was shaken overnight at 37°C. To the remainder of the "Plate 1" was added 1.2 L of 1M IPTG; this was shaken overnight at 22°C. After the overnight growth, the two test plates were spun at 3000 r.p.m. for 10 min; the media was then drained from the plates. Lysis buffer (100 L) (500 mM NaCl; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; and 0.1% Tween 20) was added to the pellets and pipetted up and down to resuspend the cells. Each solution was sonicated with a microtip three times for 2 sec with intervals of cooling. Ten microliters (10 L) of the supernatants were removed and placed into a clean PCR plate (total cell fraction). Ten microliters (10 L) of 2x SDS boiling buffer were added to each well. The remaining culture material remaining in the growth plates was spun for 10 min at 5,000 r.p.m. and the remaining supernatants were transferred to a clean, flatbottom microtiter plate; 10 L of magnetic nickel beads were added to each well. After shaking for 10 min, the plate was placed on a magnetic platform for 1 min. The supernatant was removed and discarded. The plate was removed from the magnetic platform and the beads resuspended with 100 L buffer. After gentle mixing for 1 min, the beads were washed twice. After the final washing, the supernatant was removed and the protein eluted by addition of 30 L buffer including 250 mM imidazole. After 1 min, the plate was placed back on the magnetic platform and the supernatant was carefully removed and transferred to a clean PCR plate (soluble fraction). Thirty microliters (30 L) of 2 SDS boiling buffer were added to each well. All samples (total cell and soluble fractions) were heated at 95°C for 5 min in a PCR machine and run on SDS-PAGE gels. Bands appearing at the appropriate molecular weight for the protein of interest indicated both expression and solubility when cells were grown in LB/kanamycin. Expression and Purification A medium scale cell culture was grown by adding 500 mL LB medium, 25 mL of 10% glucose solution, 500 L of 30 mg/mL kanamycin solution, and a small amount of transformed cell glycerol stock scraping to a 2 L baffled flask and shaking overnight at 250 r.p.m. and 30°C.
PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

The expression medium was prepared by adding 500 mL LB medium, 25 mL of 10% glucose solution, 500 L of 30 mg/mL kanamycin solution to each of six flasks (3 L total). Ten milliliters (10 mL) of the overnight culture were added to each flask and the cultures were held at 250 r.p.m. and 37°C until the O.D. (595 nm) reached 0.8. The cultures were then induced with 200 L 1M IPTG. After shaking overnight at 250 r.p.m. and 21°C, the contents of the flasks were poured into 1 L spin bottles and centrifuged at 6500 r.p.m. for 10 min. After removal of the supernatant, the pellets were collected into 50 mL conical tubes (total mass 28.0 g) and frozen at 80°C. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (35 mL/10 g) containing 50 L of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, http://www.sigma-aldrich.com) and 5 L benzonase (Novagen, http://www.emdbiosciences.com) and subjected to repeated sonication with intervals of cooling. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at 38,900 g for 30 min. The protein was then immobilized on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), placed on a drip column, washed with 25 mL buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 500 mM NaCl; 10 mM imidazole; 10 mM methionine; and 10% glycerol), and eluted into Amicon concentrator (Millipore) with 15 mL buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole. The solution was concentrated to 6 mL, loaded onto an S200 gel filtration column, and was eluted with buffer containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM methionine, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM DTT. The protein yield was 29 mg which was concentrated to 29 mg/mL. Seleno-methionine labeled protein was produced using M9 media with amino acids including SeMet instead of Met and purified in a similar manner. Crystallization and Data Collection High throughput screen from Hampton research was used for initial screening with protein concentration of 10 mg/mL and 1:1 ratio of protein and precipitant. Thin needle-like crystals were obtained with precipitant containing 30% pentaerythritol ethoxylate, 50 mM ammonium sulfate, 50 mM Bis-Tris at pH 6.5 (Index Screen # 57). Long-rod-like diffracting quality crystals (dimensions 0.3 mm 0.2 mm 0.5 mm) of the Se­Met form of the putative PGPase from L. monocytogenes grew in 1 week at room temperature by changing the ammonium sulfate concentration in the reservoir to 200 mM. Cryoprotection was achieved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen after transfer to mother liquor containing 10% glycerol. Crystals diffract to at least 1.8 Å resolution and belong to the monoclinic space group P21. Assuming four molecules of 19,600 Da per asymmetric unit, the Matthews coefficient is 2.3 Å3/Da corresponding to an estimated solvent content of 43%. Two wavelength anomalous dispersion data were obtained from a single flash-frozen crystal near the Se absorption edge using MARCCD 165 detector on SGX-CAT (31-ID) beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. Data were indexed, integrated and scaled using HKL2000. Crystal parameters and data collection statistics are provided in Table I.

Structure Determination and Refinement The structure was determined by the two-wavelength anomalous dispersion (peak and high-energy remote) method with Selenium-labeled protein. Three out of the possible four selenium positions in the asymmetric unit were identified using SOLVE 2.0.1,15 and used for phase refinement with SHARP 2.06.16,17 The resulting experimental electron density map was of excellent quality and revealed virtually all of the secondary structural elements comprising the tetramer. Automated model building with ARP/wARP yielded 90% of each protomeric polypeptide chain.18 Following manual building of the remainder of the protein, metal ions, water molecules, and a glycerol, using "O",19,20 the final atomic model was refined with CNS by the slowcool annealing method.21 Phasing and refinement statistics are provided in Table I. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB Code: 1Y9I) RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure Determination and Refined Atomic Model Quality The crystal structure of a selenomethioine (Se­Met) form of PGPase was determined via dual-wavelength anomalous dispersion (one Se­Met per 167 residues). A difference Fourier synthesis calculated after initial refinement of the protein atomic model with CNS21 revealed eight strong peaks (two per molecule; average peak heights of 10 20 e /Å3), none of which corresponded to either protein atoms or crystallization buffer components. All eight of these electron density features were identified as bound metal ions, because they are coordinated by carboxylate groups and water molecules. X-ray fluorescence of our putative PGPase crystals effectively ruled out the presence of commonly observed transition metals, such as Zn2 , Cu2 , Co2 , Ni2 , Fe2 , and Mn2 . Given the metal co-ordination geometry and the difference electron density peak heights, we have modeled the top four peaks as Ca2 and the second four as Mg2 , with one Ca2 and one Mg2 for each of molecules comprising the asymmetric unit. Some PGPases are known to require Mg2 for their enzymatic activity.1 The final refinement model has excellent stereochemistry, and consists of 4944 protein atoms (residues Lys6 Asp164 for each component of the tetramer), 4 Ca2 , 4 Mg2 ions, 469 water molecules, and one glycerol in the asymmetric unit. The final crystallographic R factor is 21.1% (R free 24.5%) at 1.8 Å resolution. Description of the Structure and Fold Identification The structure of the putative L. monocytogenes PGPase is illustrated in Figure 2(a). The polypeptide chain is largely -helical, with nine helices ( 1­ 9). Helices 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9 form a mixed polarity five helix bundle. 3 and 5 run approximately orthogonal to cylindrical axes of the helical bundle (protomer dimensions 46 Å 31 Å 21 Å), while 2 is inclined at 45° [Fig. 2(a)]. The remarkable level of sequence identity and the pattern of

amino acid differences among the sequences depicted in Figure 1 allow us to conclude that all known PGPase family members (both annotated and putative) share the same three-dimensional structure.22 A Dali database search with PGPase identified two hypothetical proteins (PDB Codes 1RFZ and 1TLQ) with high structural similarity. These two structures were not available at the time of target selection. 1RFZ and 1TLQ show 67% and 55% sequence identity with PGPase (1Y9I), respectively. Rootmean-square deviations (RMSD) for C atom pairs are 1.32 Å and 1.49 Å for 115 and 153 equivalent residues, respectively. Binuclear Metal Center and Putative Active Site At one end of each quasi-cylindrical protomer, two metal ions, Ca2 and Mg2 , form a hetero binuclear center (mean metal ion separation: 4.0 Å) with the carboxylate side chain of Asp98 serving as a bridge between the two metal ions (Fig. 2). These sites are located within a hydrophilic cavity near a portion of the surface of the molecule with negative calculated electrostatic potential (Fig. 3). The calcium ion is octa-coordinated with dodecahedral coordination geometry by the carboxylate groups of Asp98 and Glu99 (bidentate ligand), the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr95, and three well-localized water molecules. The magnesium ion is hexa-coordinated with octahedral geometry by the carboxylate oxygens of Asp98, Asp144, and Asp145, the carbonyl oxygen of Thr141, and two water molecules [Fig. 2(b,c)]. Asp98 is bridging the Ca2 and Mg2 ions in a tridendate configuration (bidendate to Ca2 and monodendate to Mg2 ). All observed coordination distances are within the allowed range (Table II).23,24 Coordinating residues are primarily derived from helices 6, 8, and 9, and loops L1 and L2 [Fig. 2(a)]. It is remarkable that all metal-coordinating residues are conserved within the PGPase sequence family, suggesting that all of these proteins possess two metal ions in the active site (Fig. 1). Given the location of the metal ions and strict conservation of the coordinating residues, we conclude that the metals identify the active site of the enzyme and are almost certainly involved in catalytic activity. The active site pocket is lined by conserved residues from two tetramer components, while metal coordinating ligands originate from only one protomer. In addition to the metal coordinating ligands described earlier, conserved and partially conserved residues from five different sequence motifs comprise the surface of the cavity, including M1 (Gln36-Tyr39), M2 (Asp91-Gly93), M3 (Gly110Lys124), M4 (Asn132-His134), and M5 (Leu158-His160) (Fig. 1; highlighted in gray). Interestingly, motif M1, residues Gly110-Asn116 from motif M3, and motif M5 are derived from one protomer, whereas motif M2, residues Tyr117-Lys124 from motifs M3, and M4 come from an adjacent protomer [Fig. 3(b)]. Gln36, Asp91, Gly110, Ser111, Ile112, Thr115, Gly118, Asp121, Lys124, Ala159, and His160 are conserved among members of this protein sequence family, and may constitute a PGPase signature

sequence. Asp91 is hydrogen-bonded to metal coordinated water molecules (wat25, wat44, and wat342) and His134 [Fig. 2(c)], suggesting that Asp91 and His134 are two important residues forming a dyad at the active site. His134 is substituted with Lys or Glu or Asn or Cys in some members of this family (Fig. 1). Accordingly, the negative charge on Asp91 may play a larger role in the catalysis than the hydrogen bond with His134. The binuclear metal­Asp­water arrangement seen in this structure has been observed in a pyrophosphatase structure also.25 The putative active sites of 1RFZ and 1TLQ are identical to our PGPase. While a Ca2 ion has been identified in 1TLQ, no metal ion is identified in 1RFZ. We would have expected binuclear metal sites in both compared to our structure but the reason for the absence is not clear.

Comparison with Other Phosphatases Containing Binuclear Metal Centers The presence of bound metals surrounded by a conserved feature on the surface of the enzyme suggests that there is a mechanistic relationship between the helical PGPases and certain , metal dependent binuclear phosphatases of known structure, including purple acid phosphatases (PAP), serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP), and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatases though the polypeptide chain folds of these phosphatases are different.26 ­32 All PAPs contain binuclear Fe3 -Me2 active site centers (where Me can be Fe2 or Zn2 or Mn2 ). Me is Fe2 for mammalian PAP, Zn2 in red kidney bean PAP, and Mn2 in sweet potato PAP. Serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP)

It is generally believed that the mechanisms of action for these three / enzymes (PAP, PP, and 1-ptase) all involve a nucleophilic attack of a metal-bound hydroxide on the

phosphorus atom of the substrate, leading to hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphate-ester bond, and release of the leaving group.33,34 We suggest that PGPase mediated catalysis also involves metal activated nucleophilic attack on the substrate phosphorous atom.

the three / phosphatases in some respects. In PAP, PP, and 1-ptase, the putative nucleophilic water directly bridges the two metal atoms (Me2 OH2O 2.0 ­2.4 Å). In the PGPases, a bridging water (wat44) is 3.2 Å from the magnesium ion and could be the putative nucleophilic water. Moreover, the metals of the three / phosphatases are coordinated by acidic groups (Asp and Glu) and His and Asn. In the PGPases, the metal ions are coordinated by Asp and Glu side chains and a main-chain carbonyl oxygen. This difference may be due to the nature of metal ions present in the proteins. A conserved signature motif, DX[GH]-(X)n-GDXX[YX](X)n-GNH[ED] (where n 20), has been identified in a large group of phosphoesterases, including PAPs, PPs, exonucleases, and 5 -nucleotidases.35,36 Interestingly, all of these functionally related enzymes share active-site binuclear metal centers. Although no such signature motif is found in PGPases, a binuclear metal active site is observed in our structure. PGPases and 5 -nucleotidases, both of which share a binuclear metal center and a catalytic Asp­His dyad, differ with respect to both polypeptide chain fold and the structure of the binuclear metal center. The 5 -nucleotidases are two domain-molecules with / fold and two active site zinc ions.37,38 The metal binding properties of the helical PGPases appear unique. Further studies like substrate complex structure and site-directed mutagenesis may help in characterizing the substrate-binding mode to provide more detailed insight into the two-metal ion catalytic mechanism. Oligomerization and Channel Formation PGPase forms a tetramer (a dimer-of-dimers) of quasiequivalent protomers (pairwise RMSDs 1.0 Å) via noncrystallographic 222 symmetry (tetrameric dimensions 47 59 63 Å3; Fig. 4). There are two intratetramer interfaces, one between the monomers comprising the dimer and the other between the two dimers. 6 and 7 from each protomer form the core of the dimer interface with interactions from both hydrophobic and hydrophilic

and 6 from each protomer form the tetramer interface [Fig. 4(a)]. Residues distributed throughout the lengths of these helices are involved in numerous interactions within the tetramer interface, including hydrogen bonds between protein atoms, water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. 6 participates in both the dimer and tetramer interfaces. Within the tetramer we observed a long, narrow tunnel running throughout its length (approximately 32 Å 3 Å; Figs. 4, 5), bounded by the tilted 6 helices from each protomer (Fig. 5). Within the tunnel we detected two long inter-linked (25-Å) linear water chains, which are sandwiched between the dimers [Fig. 4(b)]. In all, there are 28 water molecules exhibiting the same 222 (NCS) symmetry relating the four protomers comprising the tetramer (Figs. 4, 5). The refined isotropic thermal factors of these water molecules are comparable to those of neighboring protein atoms (Table I). Each chain contains 12 water molecules linked by a network of hydrogen bonds in a linear fashion

with four waters linking the two chains [Fig. 4(b)]. Each water chain forms hydrogen bonds with protein atoms from all four protomers (Fig. 5). A schematic diagram of the hydrogen bond network is shown in Figure 6. Sidechain atoms of residues Glu60 and Asn107, and mainchain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Ile100 and Ser104 from each protomer participate in a network of hydrogen bonds with noncrystallographic 222 symmetry [Fig. 5(b)]. Glu60 is invariant within the PGPase family (Fig. 1). With the exception of the BH1441 protein and Q5ULJ2 Orf122, Asn107 is also invariant (Gln in Q5ULJ2 Orf122). Leu103 and Phe114 forming the mid core of the channel in PGPase are also conserved (Fig. 1). The observed conservation pattern for residues lining the tunnel, suggests that all of the other PGPase family members, except the BH1441 protein, have a similar linear arrangement of water molecules buried within the tetramer interface. It appears unlikely that the observed water molecules indicate the presence of a water-conductDOI 10.1002/prot

ing channel within the PGPases, because it lacks Asn­Pro­ Ala (NPA) motif that serves as a water selective filter region and the aromatic/Arg (ar/R) constriction region found in aquaporins.39,40 Instead, the hydrogen-bonded water chains found in the PGPase tetramer tunnel suggest that it may serve to conduct protons along its length (i.e., a "proton wire"41). So-called proton wires were observed in X-ray structures of the photosynthetic reaction center from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, bacteriorhodopsin, in the lumen-side domain of cytochrome f and in cytochrome c oxidase.42­52 But there is only one water chain in these proteins, while in PGPase we identified two interlinked water chains [Fig. 5]. Photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) catalyzing lightdriven electron transport across photosynthetic membranes utilize a 23-Å-long water chain extending from the QB chromophore to the cytoplasmic side of the RC.43 Site-directed mutagenesis and flash-induced absorbance spectroscopy results suggest that the role of this water chain is to transfer protons from solution to the secondary quinone QB.42 In PGPase, the length of each water chain is 25 Å, containing 12 water molecules. In the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR), photoisomerization of the retinal initiates a cyclic reaction in which a proton is translocated across the membrane from the buried Schiff base to the extracellular surface through a network of hydrogen bonds.46 Structural features common to bacteriorhodopsin and the photosynthetic reaction centers are intramembrane carboxylate residues with unusually high pK values (pKa 9) and water molecules within or near to the path along which protons are translocated. The crystal structure of cytochrome f, a subunit of the proton pumping integral cytochrome b6f complex of oxygenic photosynthetic membranes, revealed an 11-Å-long chain of five water molecules.48 It is suggested that this chain may function as the lumen-side exit port for proton translocation by the cytochrome b6f.47 Interestingly in PGPase, the active site of each protomer is connected to this water

chain through a network of hydrogen bonds [Figs. 2(c), 5] formed by Glu60, a water molecule and backbone nitrogen of Tyr95. The backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr95 is coordinated to the Ca2 ion. This scenario is very similar to that observed for cytochrome f in which the heme iron is connected to the water chain via the coordinating histidine. This similarity suggests strongly that PGPase may also be involved in proton transport. The arrangement of hydrogen bonds in the water chains is reminiscent of the arrangement in gramicidin, wherein each water makes three hydrogen bonds with one hydrogen bond donated to protein atoms forming the channel.41,53 The linear chain is constructed by donating one hydrogen bond to the subsequent water and accepting one from the previous water molecule in the chain. Notably, the orientation of one water molecule (e.g., wat8) changes and accepts hydrogen from both the adjacent waters and donates two to channelforming residues introducing a hydrogen-bonding defect. Thus, Figure 6 represents the unprotonated state. In the protonated state, the orientation of these waters must change to achieve proton translocation by Grotthuss mechanism. Conclusions/Biological Implications The 1.8-Å resolution X-ray structure of the putative PGPase from L. monocytogenes reveals the binuclear metal binding active site. The active site environment of PGPase appears related to that seen in the binuclear phosphatases. A plausible mechanistic role is proposed for the metal bound water and Asp-His dyad. The tetrameric enzyme contains two 25-Å-long interconnected hydrogenbonded water chains. Hydophophic residues Ile100 and Phe114 from each protomer form the mid core of the chains. Side-chain atoms and the carbonyl oxygen of Asn107 and the carbonyl oxygen of Ser104 from all the four protomers form hydrogen-bond networks. On comparing bacteriorhodopsin, cytochrome f, and photosynthetic reaction center, we conclude that the PGPase probably

conducts protons. Bridging of the metal-containing active site and the water channel by conserved Glu60 in PGPase resembles a similar bridging interaction supported by a histidine in cytochrome b6f complex, an electron/proton transfer photosynthetic protein. The probable function of water chain in cytochrome f is that it acts as p-side exit port for protons translocated across the membrane by the cytochrome b6f complex, where cytochrome b6 is an integral membrane protein and cytochrome f is a periplasmic protein. By comparison, there is a possibility that the water-soluble PGPase might act as an exit port for protons translocated across the membrane by an unidentified integral membrane protein.
