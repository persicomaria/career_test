ABSTRACT

Plant seed storage proteins were among the first proteins (20); however, have With only recently, as a result of using

techniques, determined.

the amino acid sequences

of many of these proteins been data for many

the accumulation of amino acid sequence

vicilin-type storage proteins much has been learned concerning the location of conserved amino acid regions and other regions which can tolerate amino acid sequence variation. Combining this knowledge with recent advances in

plant gene transfer technologies will allow molecular biologists to correct (by using amino acid replacement mutations) the sulfur amino acid deficiency inherent to bean seed storage proteins. The development of more nutritious

soybean and common bean seeds will be of benefit to programs involving human and animal nutrition.

amino acid composition encoded by the insert is quite different from that found in the remaining Gma-e'-polypeptide as it is rich in glutamate

residues

(Fig.2); however, despite being quite different in both nucleotide

and amino acid sequences from the surrounding proto-Gma-a'-gene this insert has been able to achieve both functional and evolutionary stability.

The evolutionary relationships among the amino acid sequences of these seed storage proteins was further refined by adding the amino acid sequences of the vicilin-type seed storage proteins from pea

(P.

sacivum)

Information concerning the location of conserved amino acid

sequence regions is important because such regions would be poor choices for the placement of amino acid modifications. Amino acid replacement mutations

designed to increase the number of sulfur-containing amino acids should be placed sequence. in regions which show little or no conservation of amino acid

generally true,

the transfer of many plant genes among the different plant

CONCLUDING REMARKS

This is indeed an interesting time to be involved in plant molecular biology research as just in the last three years the addition of new techniques for plant gene transfers has greatly enhanced our ability to learn how plant Much has recently been learned about the structure of many
