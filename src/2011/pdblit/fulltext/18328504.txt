Abstract Epidemiological investigations of isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar 4, 12:b:- were carried out to establish particular molecular markers to assign isolates to a common origin. Plasmid pro®ling demonstrated that over 50% of 291 isolates, obtained between 1991 and 1996, were plasmid-free. The remaining isolates exhibited a common trend in plasmid content of 105 and 2 kb. Although no speci®c correlation to any particular source within the poultry industry was discernible using plasmid analysis, there were indications of clonality with local divergence. Ribotyping with EcoRI demonstrated limited discriminative potential as 96% of the isolates expressed a common pro®le. Ribotyping with HindIII failed to further differentiate the isolates. IS200 (PstI) typing and PFGE (NotI and XbaI) afforded some degree of further discrimination with selected isolates. Each technique produced four pro®les, but dominant pro®les were also apparent. Eighteen variables were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis in order to identify risk areas associated with broiler ¯ocks within the industry. An increased risk for S. 4, 12:b:infection was only associated with the feedmills used. Random effects at the house and/or farm level were also found to be statistically signi®cant. Of the 16 feedmills associated with the isolation of 4, 12:b:-, six were deemed to be signi®cant risk factors. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Salmonella enterica serovars associated with species of poultry are many and widespread (Nagaraja et al., 1991), with new serovars appearing constantly. Different serovars often demonstrate ¯uctuations in prevalence because of differences in many epidemiological factors. In Denmark, at the end of the 1970s, an increasing number of Salmonella isolations were made from poultry. Epidemiological investigations indicated that contaminated feed was the main problem (Bisgaard, 1978). As a result of the increased awareness of the problems associated with Salmonella in certain importing countries, Denmark, in its role as a meat/poultry exporting country, initiated intensive investigation within the broiler industry. Between 1984 and 1986, approximately 25% of 4288 broiler ¯ocks examined were Salmonella positive at slaughter, from which at least 26 different serovars were identi®ed. S. Typhimurium (5.8% of ¯ocks), S. Indiana (3.9%), S. Berta (3.0%), S. Infantis (1.9%), S. Binza (1.9%), S. Hadar (1.7%) and S. 4, 12:b:- (1.5%) made up approximately 70% of the cases. Sixty four of the ¯ocks demonstrated two or more serovars. Bacterial investigations and statistical analysis revealed signi®cant correlation between certain serovars and particular hatcheries, slaughterhouses and feedmills (Harlou et al., 1988). In order to reduce the level of S. enterica infections in broilers, a national eradication program was implemented (Bisgaard, 1992). The program has been continuously upgraded according to speci®c epidemiological investigations (Baggesen et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1992, 1994; Olsen et al., 1992; Christensen et al., 1994, 1997), and statistical analysis of risk factors (Angen et al., 1996). As a result a decreasing prevalence of S. enterica has been observed and certain serovars have been successfully eliminated (Anon., 1996). During the last 6 years, the prevalence of S. enterica serovar 4, 12:b:- in broiler ¯ocks in Denmark has ¯uctuated (Fig. 1). In 1995, serotype distribution of 4, 12:b:- from broilers was on a par with the two other main serotypes associated with the broilers, S. Typhimurium and S. Infantis. However, unlike S. Typhimurium, S. 4, 12:b:- has not been associated with salmonellosis in humans to any great degree. In addition, serovar S. 4, 12:b:- has not been associated with clinical disease or mortality in infected broiler ¯ocks (Danish Poultry Council, 2001, unpublished data), nor has it been identi®ed as a problem in other countries. Data from the Danish Plant Directorate in 1995 concerning detection of Salmonella in compound feeds indicated no evidence of Salmonella in the poultry feed (Anon., 1996). However, during process control, Salmonella was established. Similar data with regard to the detection of Salmonella in various feed products demonstrated the presence of S. 4, 12:b:- in rapeseed-associated feed, though at a low level (Anon., 1996). In this study, we report an epidemiological investigation of S. 4, 12:b:- isolates primarily within Denmark from 1992 to 1996, in an attempt to identify sources of origin, with a view to elimination of this serovar. Plasmid pro®le analysis, ribotyping, IS200 and pulse-®eld gel electrophoresis were employed to establish molecular markers to contribute to the epidemiological picture of S. 4, 12:b:- infection in broilers. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of 18 variables and random effects at the house and/or farm level were also employed for further assessment of potential risk factors associated with S. 4, 12:b:infection within the broiler industry.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Bacteriological examination in the broiler flocks The Salmonella status of the broiler ¯ocks were based upon examination of 60 fresh faecal samples (pooled as 12 Â 5 faecal samples) taken by the farmers at the age of approximately 3 weeks. This number of samples should detect an infected ¯ock with a prevalence level of >5% with a probability of >95%, given that the sensitivity of the test is 100% (Martin et al., 1987). Initial bacteriological examinations were carried out at the Danish Veterinary Laboratory, Aarhus. Isolation of S. enterica was performed according to a modi®ed method of the procedures outlined by the Nordic Committee on Food Analysis (Anon., 1991). Brie¯y, one 10 g sample of faecal material from each pooled sample was added to 90 ml of buffered peptone water and incubated aerobically at 378C for 18±20 h. Thereafter, 0.1 ml was incubated in 9.9 ml of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (Oxoid) at 41.58C for 16±18 h followed by sub-cultivation on BLSF agar (Oxoid) with 0.2% Lutensit AB-A at 378C for 18±20 h. Serotype identi®cation was carried out (Kauffmann, 1972), using a maximum of ®ve

suspected Salmonella colonies from each plate for biochemical and serological characterisation. One or more colonies identi®ed as 4, 12:b:- constituted a positive Salmonella status within the ¯ock. 2.2. Bacterial strains All strains were taken from stock culture collections and stored as Luria±Bertani (LB) broth (LB broth base, Gibco) cultures with sterile glycerol (15% v/v) at À808C. Two hundred and ninety one strains of S. 4, 12:b:- were used in this investigation. The collection consisted of strains predominantly from Denmark, derived from poultry-associated sources. Initially, 168 isolates of S. 4, 12:b:- were selected from a total of 496 isolates available. The isolates chosen represented all the farms (including different houses on each farm), years (1991±1995), hatcheries, feedmills and slaughterhouses associated with their isolation. Details concerning the origin of these isolates are outlined in Table 1 (subset 1). In total, 16 separate feedmills were involved in supplying feed to the ¯ocks from which 168 isolates of S. 4, 12:b:- were selected for epidemiological investigation. The remaining Danish isolates were obtained from chicken neck skin after slaughter (37), where samples were negative for S. 4, 12:b:-, prior to slaughter from feed-stuff (of unspeci®ed origin) (9) and from miscellaneous sources including: pig (9), bovine (5), chicken (5), chicken feed (18), bonemeal (1) rapeseed products (2) and unspeci®ed origins (4) (see Table 1, subset 2). In addition, 10 isolates of S. 4, 12:b:- were obtained from Sweden and a further 23 isolates from the United Kingdom. The isolates obtained from these two countries were associated with poultry and poultry products but also from other animal species (Table 1, subset 2). Reference strains of Salmonella serotype 0:4 (B) from Â the Unite des Enterobacteries, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, were also included in the study to determine the degree of relatedness to the serotype S. 4, 12:b:-. These included: S. Java (ST180) 4, 5, 12: b:-1, 2; S. Fulicia (Ref. 539 K) 4, 5, 12: a:-; II (Ref. 277/67) 4, 12: g, z62:-; S. Hato (Ref. 551 K) 4, 5, 12: g, m, s:-; S. Schleissheim (Ref. 31 K) 4, 12, 27: b:-; S. Abony (ST150) 1, 4, 5, 12, 27: bH e, n, x; II (Ref. 1405/74) 4, 12: l, z28:-; S. Essen (Ref. 22 K) 4, 12: g, m:-, and S. California (Ref. 104 k) 4, 12: g, m, t:-. 2.3. Plasmid profile analysis Isolates of S. 4, 12:b:- were screened for the presence of plasmid DNA (Kado and Lui, 1981). Gels were stained in ethidium bromide (Sigma) 2 mg/ml, illuminated with a 254 nm UV transilluminator (UVP; model TS-40) and photographed with a Polaroid Land Camera (Polaroid; MP-4). Plasmid mobility was calculated relative to the reference plasmids in Escherichia coli strains V517 (Macrina et al., 1978) and 39R861 (Threlfall et al., 1986) and sizes estimated (Rochelle et al., 1985). Coiled covalently closed (ccc) and open circular (oc) DNA molecules were differentiated (Hintermann et al., 1981). 2.4. Ribotyping Isolation of DNA and digestion with EcoRI and HindIII (Boehringer-Mannheim) and subsequent electrophoretic separation of the DNA fragments (AGE) were performed as

previously described (Christensen et al., 1993). The DNA was transferred to nylon membranes for hybridisation (Hybond-N, Amersham) by vacuum blotting as recommended by the supplier (Pharmacia, LKB). DNA was subsequently ®xed to the membrane by baking at 808C for 1±3 h. Ribosomal RNA (16S and 23S) from E. coli (Sigma) was purchased and labeled with digoxigenin by the use of reverse transcriptase (BoehringerMannheim) as previously reported (Christensen et al., 1993). Brie¯y, the probes were hybridized to the membrane-®xed DNA; all the isolates were initially ribotyped using EcoRI. A proportion of the isolates (56) were additionally ribotyped using the enzyme HindIII (Table 2). These isolates are designated as subset 3 and were selected on the basis of plasmid pro®les and ribotypes obtained with EcoRI; where similar plasmid pro®les and ribotypes were demonstrated with the isolates. Furthermore, the isolates were selected so that a range of origins with respect to hatcheries, feedmills, slaughterhouses and ¯ocks were covered to allow for any differences that may have arisen with further typing to be correlated to a particular origin. The same 56 isolates were also subjected to IS200 typing and PFGE (see below). 2.5. IS200 typing Total DNA was isolated as described by Christensen et al. (1993). Approximately 1 mg was digested with PstI. For use as a hybridization probe, IS200 was generated by

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotides complementary to 26 and 25 bases of the promoter sequences T7 and SP6, as primers. PCR assay conditions have been described (Rossen et al., 1991). Generated PCR product was subjected to AGE in agarose (Litex LSL, 1.2% w/v in 1X TAE buffer) (Maniatis et al., 1982) and puri®ed with a DNA isolation kit (Prep-a-Gene, Bio-Rad). IS200 probe was labeled with digoxigenin by random priming (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983). 2.6. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis Genomic DNA was prepared in chromosomal-grade agarose (Bio-Rad) as previously described (Cameron et al., 1994). Digestion with restriction enzymes was performed by cutting a slice plug that contained DNA and incubation for 1 h with the appropriate enzyme buffer followed by 4 h with 20 U of restriction enzyme. For PFGE, XbaI and NotI (Amersham) restriction enzymes were used. DNA fragments were subjected to electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose (Litex LSL) gels in 0.5X Tris±borate±EDTA buffer (Maniatis et al., 1982) by using a Pulsaphor Plus system (Pharmacia LKB). The running conditions were 180 V/cm at 148C for 22 h. The pulse times were increased by ramping as follows: 5 s for 3 h, 9 s for 5 h, 12 s for 5 h, 20 s for 4 h and 25 s for 2 h. Multimeric phage lambda (48.5 kb) DNA (Pharmacia LKB) was used as the molecular size marker. After electrophoresis, gels were stained in ethidium bromide (Sigma) (2 mg/ml) for 15 min, destained in distilled water for 15 min and photographed under 254 nm UV transillumination. 2.7. Epidemiological study using statistical methods The ante-mortem (AM) database consists of data collected by the AM-veterinarians, the slaughterhouses and from Salmonella examination of all broiler ¯ocks at the Danish Veterinary Laboratory. The AM-veterinarian visited the respective farms 3±4 days prior to slaughter of the ¯ock and data was collected by questionnaire. This was carried out in collaboration with the farmer. Reports were subsequently sent to the Danish Poultry Council from which the AM-database is compiled. The dataset, which was provided by the Danish Poultry Council, initially contained information on 4221 ¯ocks all of which had been visited by the AM-veterinarians during 1995. The uni- and bivariate analyses were based on 3839 ¯ock observations for which the Salmonella status of the individual ¯ocks was known. The multivariate analysis was based on 2776 ¯ock observations excluding ¯ocks with missing values. Feedmills with less than 100 ¯ock observations were pooled (applied to 10 of the feedmills). A retrospective longitudinal study design was conducted to identify risk factors associated with S. 4, 12:b:- infection in the Danish broiler industry (Kleinbaum et al., 1982). The individual ¯ock was the unit of study. Based on bivariate analyses, variables were selected for multivariate analysis, selection was based on previous studies (Angen et al., 1996). In total, 18 variables were initially selected for use in multivariate analysis but only signi®cant (chi-square test with P < 0:20) and independent variables were included: (1) feedmill; (2) hatchery; (3) S. 4, 12:b:- status of the preceding ¯ock; (4) season; (5) number of houses on the farm; (6) animal density (number of chickens placed per square meter); (7) ¯ock size (number of chickens placed in the house); (8) area of the house (m2);

(9) age of the house; (10) slaughter house of the preceding ¯ock; (11) AM-district; (12) breed (parent ¯ock); (13) use of medication (yes/no); (14) growth promoters used; (15) beetles observed (yes/no); (16) appearance of bedding (hard/wet/dry); (17) days between cleaning and disinfection; (18) days between disinfection and replacement. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using the CATMOD procedure in SAS1 (SAS Stat1 User's Guide, 1990) as described in detail by Angen et al. (1996). The best ®t was obtained by a combined forward and backward selection process of adding or subtracting a variable (P < 0:05) or an interaction (P < 0:01) from the model (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989). Estimation of the parameters for the variable in the ®nal model was carried out with and without a term related to the random effect on the house and on the farm level using MLn software (Rashbash and Woodhouse, 1995) for analysing multilevel statistical models (Goldstein, 1995). Due to lack of independency between ¯ocks produced within the same house, a random effect of the variance between houses was evaluated. Similar evaluation was performed for houses located on the same farm, where dependency between houses was expected. The random effects (uj.) of the houses and farms were assumed to be normally distributed (with zero mean and variance s2). 3. Results 3.1. Plasmid profile analysis A total of 169 (58%) out of 291 isolates of S. 4, 12:b:- were plasmid-free. All of the remaining isolates carried plasmid DNA and 21 different molecular weights were identi®ed. The molecular weights of the plasmids ranged from 130 to 2 kb (Table 1). A plasmid of 105 kb appeared most frequently. Seventy percent of the isolates that demonstrated plasmids, harbored the 105 kb plasmid, either alone (50%) or in combination with smaller plasmids. A small plasmid of 2 kb was evident in 19% of the plasmid harboring strains and appeared alone in 16% of these isolates. Twenty seven different plasmid pro®les were observed among the isolates of S. 4, 12:b:which originated predominately from Denmark (258) but also included isolates from the UK (23) and Sweden (10). Thirty eight of the 41 isolates from chicken neck skin were plasmid-free and the remaining three isolates possessed the 2 kb plasmid (Table 1). Thirty one of the 40 isolates from feedstuff and related raw material did not harbor plasmids either. The remaining nine isolates contained either a 130 kb plasmid alone (2), 105 kb plasmid (5), 30 kb plasmid (1) or a 2 kb plasmid (1). Among the broiler isolates selected for characterisation, plasmid free isolates also dominated (74/168). Plasmid pro®ling of the Danish isolates from miscellaneous sources, also demonstrated an absence of plasmids. However, a larger plasmid of 130 kb was identi®ed in isolates from pigs and feed (unspeci®ed source) (Table 1). Plasmid pro®les of isolates obtained from the UK and Sweden are detailed in Table 1 (subset 2). Plasmid-free pro®les were predominant among these isolates too. The isolates from Sweden demonstrated a 130 kb plasmid and the 105 kb plasmid was evident among the isolates from imported feed (UK) and rapeseed (Sweden).

3.2. Ribotyping When EcoRI-digested DNA was probed with 16S and 23S cDNA, 11 different ribotypes were observed (Fig. 2). However, one predominant ribotype pattern was demonstrated with 270 (93%) of the 291 S. 4, 12:b:- isolates. Roman numerals were assigned arbitrarily to each pattern demonstrated, the predominant type pattern being I. Three isolates demonstrated type III. All three carried a single 2 kb plasmid, however, many of the type I isolates demonstrated the same plasmid. The remaining ribotypes corresponded to the following plasmid pro®les: II (105; 3.4; 3.1; 2 kb); IV (105; 5.6); V (105); VI (plasmid-free); VII (plasmid-free); VIII (12.7; 6.4); IX (plasmid-free); X (105) and XI (105). Only single isolates produced these pro®les (Fig. 2). The 56 selected isolates ribotyped with HindIII also produced a common pro®le with only one exception (Table 2, subset 3). No common band was demonstrated with the reference strains and S. 4, 12:b:- isolates. However, the pro®le of the S. Java strain exhibited a close similarity to the ribotype I pattern (EcoRI) demonstrated with the S. 4, 12:b:- isolates. 3.3. IS200 typing The same 56 isolates selected for ribotyping with HindIII were subjected to IS200 typing (Table 2). Four different pro®les were obtained A to D (Table 2 and Fig. 3). A predominant

pro®le (A) was demonstrated and only one isolate exhibited the respective pro®les B, C and D, all of which were broiler ¯ock isolates from Denmark. 3.4. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis The isolates of S. 4, 12:b:- were also used in PFGE analysis in an attempt to provide a more sensitive means of discrimination, particularly among plasmid-free isolates and those that harbored a 105 kb plasmid and were ribotype pattern I. Four different PFGE types were produced using NotI and three with XbaI (Table 2). When using the NotI enzyme, 86% of the isolates demonstrated a type 1 PFGE pattern. Similarly, XbaI produced a common pattern in 77% of the isolates. The two enzymes produced a difference in PFGE pro®les in only 7% of the strains screened. The only clear discrimination provided was with two isolates demonstrating a single 130 kb plasmid where XbaI and NotI PFGE pro®les 2 and 4 were observed, respectively. 3.5. Statistical analysis (univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis) The uni- and bivariate analyses were based on dataset A consisting of 3839 Danish broiler ¯ock observations. The descriptive statistics of the continuous variables are

described in Section 2.7. Only variables that produced numerical data could be analyzed. The remaining variables were not appropriate due to the nature of the information provided, for example, appearance of the bedding (16) is categorized as either hard, wet, dry or dry and hard. In the multivariate logistic regression (2776 ¯ock observations) only the feedmills were shown to be signi®cantly associated with S. 4, 12:b:- infections in Danish broiler ¯ocks. An increased risk for S. 4, 12:b:- infection in the broiler ¯ocks was associated with six of the 10 feedmills analyzed. The ®nal model (only including the feedmills) was further analyzed by including a random effect at the house and/or farm level. Added separately (data not shown) and simultaneously both the random effects at the house (0.8) and farm level (2.1) were statistically signi®cant (P < 0:05). There was only minor variation seen between houses but more between farms. Including the variable `hatchery' did not change the variation between farms (data not shown). By including the variable `S. 4, 12:b:- status of the preceding ¯ock' in the model (including the random effects), all the variation between houses was negligible (data not shown). 4. Discussion Identi®cation of epidemiological markers, such as plasmid pro®les and ribotyping, associated with serotypes of S. enterica have previously proved to be an effective means of establishing the source of infections (Baggesen et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1992; Lahellec et al., 1986; Olsen et al., 1992). However, in the present study, the use of a range of established molecular typing methods presented dif®culties in establishing differentiation between strains, although plasmid data analysis was, to a limited extent, more bene®cial. Only through multivariate logistic regression from variables established in the AMdatabase, were potential origins of S. 4, 12:b:- within the poultry industry signi®cantly demonstrated. Plasmid pro®ling demonstrated that S. 4, 12:b:- isolates harbor plasmids poorly, with over 50% of the isolates being plasmid-free. The numerical distribution within the subsets 1 and 2 (Table 1) of plasmid-free strains indicated a dominant pro®le. However, other common pro®les were identi®ed with the two subsets, demonstrating a 105 and 2 kb plasmid alone. A plasmid of 94 kb was also apparent in a number of isolates. There was indication of instability of the 105 kb plasmid. In Table 1, plasmid pro®les XI and XIV demonstrate the presence of the 105 kb plasmid and smaller plasmids (4.4, 4 and 2 kb). Plasmid pro®les XXIV and XXVII show the same small plasmids minus the 105 kb plasmid. Furthermore, these strains are linked to the same feedmill. Given the potential for instability of the 105 kb plasmid and that small plasmids are at best mobilisable, two possible scenarios present themselves. One possibility is that the S. 4, 12:b:- strains originated in Europe and carried the 105 kb plasmid at the outset, with a minority of the strains acquiring additional small plasmids through transfer or mobilization. The 105 kb plasmid may be, to a certain degree, unstable and consequently lost resulting in a trend towards increasing numbers of strains lacking the 105 kb plasmid. Alternatively, the original strains could have been plasmid-free, acquiring the 105 kb plasmid in Europe

244

together with progressive accumulation of smaller plasmids by strains containing the 105 kb plasmid and plasmid-free strains. There may even be destabilization of the 105 kb plasmid in parallel. In analysing numerical trends, it was apparent that the 105 kb plasmid was often present in strains isolated early on in 1992±1993 and that the frequency of strains containing the 105 kb plasmid was decreasing in later isolates. A trend towards either plasmid-free or presence of small plasmids was more common. Data in Table 1 also suggest that S. 4, 12:b:originated from Denmark, ®rstly on the grounds of the signi®cantly higher number of strains isolated and secondly by the sources of the isolates. Ribotyping of the isolates failed to provide identi®cation of molecular markers, or distinguishing band patterns, with 96% of the isolates expressing a common pro®le type (I) using EcoRI. Further attempts to enhance discrimination between isolates with HindIII also failed. This typing method proved particularly limited for use in establishing an epidemiological picture for S. 4, 12:b:- within the broiler ¯ocks or for isolates originating from extraneous sources. Both IS200 typing and PFGE analysis afforded some degree of differentiation compared to ribotyping. However, using combined techniques a predominant pro®le was evident and any differences observed were not substantial enough to warrant any signi®cant conclusions. Demonstration of identical pro®les of the isolates that are plasmid-free or harbor a 105 kb suggests relatedness indicating clonality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of variables established in the AM-database showed that the potential origins of S. 4, 12:b:- were signi®cantly associated with the feed, explaining the clonality or relatedness demonstrated by the typing methods used. It was evident that the level of infection in the ¯ocks was not related to the size of the feedmill. Both the largest feedmills did not result in the highest percentage of S. 4, 12:b:- infection in ¯ocks examined. In total, six feedmills were demonstrated to be signi®cantly associated with S. 4, 12:b:- infection in broiler ¯ocks. By using the MLl software it was shown that in relation to S. 4, 12:b:- infections, ¯ocks in the same house are not independent and that they are incorporated together with the other houses at the farm, and farm itself. In this study, no one particular feedmill could be attributed as a sole source of possible Salmonella contamination. Resident bacteria within a farm may be an important factor in addition to external contamination (Lahellec et al., 1986; Baggesen et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1992). The random effect related to the house may be explained by persistent infection in the house, since all variation between the houses are shown to disappear when adding the variable `S. 4, 12:b:- status of the preceding ¯ock'. The random effect related to the farm was shown to be signi®cantly associated with S. 4, 12:b:- in broiler ¯ocks. This ®nding could re¯ect that houses at the farm are epidemiologically connected (i.e. by the environment surrounding the houses at the farm, the feed systems including silo wastes at the farm and/or the slaughterhouse collecting the chickens at the farm). Since adding the variable `hatchery' did not change the variance between farms, this factor does not present itself as a risk factor associated with S. 4, 12:b:infections in broiler ¯ocks. The determination of effectiveness of the cleaning and disinfection procedures in the houses was not possible from the dataset, therefore, conditions must be evaluated indirectly. Other factors, such as the standard/age of the

houses and construction of feed systems could hinder satisfactory cleaning. However, previous investigations have shown that the size and age of the houses do not represent risk factors (Angen et al., 1996). Additionally, some data possibly had too low a precision to allow a reliable evaluation of their epidemiological importance, in particular, the presence of beetles and appearance of the bedding. Both these criteria are subjective and imprecise and therefore dif®cult to assess. Epidemiological investigations carried out in Denmark have previously indicated that Salmonella infection through contaminated feed presents a direct risk factor (Bisgaard, 1978; Brown et al., 1992). Subsequent strict guidelines for the production of feed were established, with particular reference to the construction of buildings and machinery, raw materials and ventilation. Hygiene programs were promoted, improved biosecurity, cleaning and disinfection programs and feedmills producing feed for other animals were excluded from the lines producing feed to breeding- and parent stock which were the main components involved in eradication of all serovars of S. enterica from the breeding stock. Salmonella 4, 12:b:- appeared in broilers in Denmark shortly after rapeseed products were used as feed ingredients and the main areas of contamination which have been reported to occur within the feed industry, were in feed processing. A possible explanation for persistent contamination of feed with this serovar may involve rapeseed-associated feed. Isolates of S. 4, 12:b:- have already been linked with rapeseed products (Anon., 1995, 1996). Preliminary inquiries into the processing of the raw material within Denmark, has revealed that feed for broilers is prepared on sites that also produce pig feed with the inclusion of rapeseed products. Reports of recurrent isolation of S. 4, 12;b:- associated with production of rapeseed products and the use of these in pig feed produced in the same feedmills may, however, result in cross-contamination of the broiler feed. A further control measure would presumably be to eliminate raw materials that may present a risk in addition to more stringent cleaning procedures within the processing plants. Considering the clonal structure of S. 4, 12:b:-, a common source of contamination may be likely. The incidence of S. 4, 12:b:- is relatively low in poultry and of little consequence in humans at present, but since human salmonellosis often re¯ects the density at source (creating an overspill infection to humans), if the source density increases there would be an increased risk of human infections once a critical threshold is passed. Alternatively, S. 4, 12:b:- may not be pathogenic for humans. Either way, measures to curtail further contamination and spread of this S. enterica serovar are important to avoid further repercussions within the poultry industry.
