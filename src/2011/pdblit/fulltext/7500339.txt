Higher ordered structures formed by different DNA sequences have been widely investigated in recent years because of their implications in a variety of biological functions. Among these, G-quadruplexes have exhibited a great variety depending on the exact sequence, the lengths of the G-stretches, interception by other nucleotides, and environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, salt type, and its concentration. We report here interesting conformational switches observed by NMR in the sequence d-TGGCGGC containing two GGC triplet repeats related to the disease Fragile X-Syndrome. At neutral pH, the solution structure is a parallel-stranded quadruplex in presence of K ions. Lowering the pH does not cause a major change in the structure; however, the chemical shift patterns of the C4 and G3 base protons suggest protonation of the C-tetrad in the center of the quadruplex. In contrast, the sequence forms an antiparallel duplex in Na containing solutions. As the pH of the Na sample is lowered, an equilibrium mixture of a duplex and a quadruplex appears, and at pH 2.2, the molecule exists entirely as a quadruplex. These results would be of significance from the point of view of recognition and regulation by different helicase enzymes, which have been found to discriminate between different types of quadruplex structures. © 2000 Academic Press Key Words: NMR structure; DNA quadruplex; DNA polymorphism; Fragile X Syndrome; GGC repeat.

plexes and on formation, stability and diversity of multistranded structures in aqueous solutions. Although on the average, the DNA must be a duplex with complementary base pairing, multiple folding and protein interactions can be conceived to cause separation of the strands, either transiently during processes of replication, transcription or translation, or permanently in specific regions and then these strands may associate in a variety of ways to form different types of structures. Among these, the quadruplex structures formed by G-rich sequences located at a number of positions such as telomeres (5­ 8), immunoglobulin switch regions (9) and gene promotor regions (10) have been the most widely investigated. The G-bases associate in a plane to form so called G-tetrads and that is the basis of quadruplex formation by continuous G-stretches (11­15). The relative orientations and topologies of the four strands vary significantly depending upon the experimental conditions especially the salt type and concentrations (15­17). The cations occupy central positions in between G-tetrads and provide stability by electrostatic interactions. The size of the cation seems to play an important role in this regard which results in cation specificity of the structures. Ample evidence has accumulated in the literature to indicate that many different enzymes recognise G-quadruplexes with a high degree of specificity (18 ­ 19). It is suggested that quadruplexes cause slippage of the DNA polymerase and consequent expansion of some repeat sequences during replication (20 ­21). This in turn affects transcriptional and replicational processes. A class of enzymes, namely, helicases which play crucial roles in replication, repair and recombination, recognise these structures with high specificity and cause unwinding of the quadruplex structures. For example, two helicases BLM (22) and SV40-antigen (23) unwind G-tetraplexes formed at the immunoglobulin switch regions, but the Werner Syndrome DNA helicase (WRN) (24) does not unwind these quadruplexes. Similarly, while BLM helicase unwinds the

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS were carried out by adding D 2O to a lyophilized sample, which was in H 2O earlier and monitoring the intensities of the various exchangeable proton signals as a function of time. All the 2D data contained 2048 t 2 points for each fid and the number of t 1 increments varied from 400 ­ 600. The time domain data were apodized by shifted sine square functions before 2D Fourier transformation. Quadruplex structure calculations. The quadruplex structure was calculated using experimental NOE restraints following an identical procedure as in the case of a related sequence d-TGGGCGGT studied by us earlier (36).

quadruplex formed by the Oxytricha telomeric sequence d(T 4G 4) n, the SV40-antigen helicase does not do so. It may be anticipated that the variabilities in the quadruplex structures play important roles in such specific recognition phenomena. Sequence analysis of many genomes has revealed that a large portion of the DNA, which is the so called noncoding region, contains many repeat sequences, the repeat units being of varying lengths and sequences (25­26). The number and sequences of these units seem to play important roles in controlling many diseases. The triplet repeat sequence GGC has been known to be important for the disease Fragile X-Syndrome (27). In recent studies with sequences containing a few of these repeats, bimolecular antiparallel quadruplex structures were observed under neutral pH conditions. In solutions containing Na ions novel G.C.G.C tetrads were observed stacking over the adjacent G-tetrads (28 ­29), but, in solutions containing K ions, the above tetrads were not seen (30). In both the cases, however, the triplets were separated by stretches of Ts and thus the antiparallel orientation of the strands in the quadruplexes was rather imposed. This also brought the G and C units in suitable positions for the formation of the G. C. G. C tetrads. In this context we report here the results of our NMR structural investigations on the sequence TGGCGGC, which contains two consecutive GGC repeats, under different conditions of Na , K , and H ions in aqueous solutions. We observed that in K containing solutions and at neutral pH, the molecule forms a parallel stranded quadruplex. Lowering the pH does not have much effect on the structure of the molecule. In sharp contrast, the molecule forms an antiparallel duplex with Watson-Crick GC pairs in solutions containing Na ions. When the pH of the Na sample is reduced, an equilibrium mixture of duplex and a quadruplex appears and the quadruplex gets progressively more populated at lower and lower pH values. At pH 2.2, the molecule is entirely in the quadruplex structure. MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA samples. The oligonucleotide was synthesized and purified by standard procedures (31­32). The NMR samples were prepared at a monomer strand concentration range of 1­2 mM in 0.6 ml (90% H 2O/10% D 2O) with either 10 mM potassium phosphate, 0.2 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl or 10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.0. For the studies at low pH, the same sample was adjusted to the desired value by adding HCl. For D 2O experiments, the samples were repeatedly lyophilized and redissolved in D 2O. NMR data acquisition. NMR data were obtained on a VARIAN UNITY-plus 600 MHz spectrometer. Temperature dependent one dimensional (1D) spectra (0 ­50°C) and two dimensional (2D) NOESY spectra in H 2O were recorded using jump-and-return pulse sequence (33) for H 2O suppression. Phase sensitive NOESY (34) spectra in D 2O were recorded with mixing times of 60, 120, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 ms whereas TOCSY (35) were recorded with mixing times of 20, 80, and 120 ms at 20°C. Deuterium exchange studies

RESULTS In K Solutions at Neutral pH Figure 1a shows the exchangeable imino and amino resonances of the quadruplex TGGCGGC in 100 mM KCl at pH 7.0, 5°C. The peaks in the imino region suggest that there is one major conformation and the tiny peaks correspond to some minor conformations. Sequence specific resonance assignments for the major conformation of the DNA were obtained using NOESY and TOCSY spectra following standard procedures (37­38). We could trace the self as well as sequential NOE connectivities from H8/H6 to (H1 , H2 , H2 , H3 ) protons for all the nucleotides. As an illustration, Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c show the NOEs emanating from H8/H6 to H1 and H2 /H2 protons respectively. For exchangeable proton assignments, we used NOESY spectra in H 2O which displayed several sequential connectivities involving imino, amino, (H8/H6), and sugar protons (data not shown). The NMR spectral features namely, imino peaks resonating around 11.0 ­12.0 ppm, amino peaks resonating around 9.5­10.5 ppm and presence of G-amino to GH8 cross peaks in the NOESY spectra indicate formation of a G-quadruplex structure (28 ­29, 39 ­ 46). From the peak count, it was realized that the structure was highly symmetric and the four strands were equivalent. Further, from the H8/H6-H1 NOE intensities at low mixing time, it was concluded that all the nucleotides had the base glycosidic conformations in the anti domain. Similarly, from the pattern of GH8-sugar NOE connectivities, it was realized that the molecule had a right-handed helical structure. In each of the G-tetrads, the G iNH 2-G jH8 NOEs, where i and j are the nucleotide labels, were of the type, i j. These observations fix the four strands in the quadruplex structure to be in parallel orientations (28 ­29, 39 ­ 40, 43­ 44). The melting profiles of the imino as well as of the base protons in 1D NMR spectra suggest good stability of the quadruplex structure with melting temperature around 45°C (data not shown). The 2D NOESY spectra show a number of inter residue connectivities involving C4 nucleotides (Fig. 1). The H5 and H6 protons of C4 nucleotide are upfield shifted compared to those of C7. These observations suggest that the base protons of C4 are experiencing strong shielding ring current shifts

lar dynamics protocol as in the case of a related sequence d-TGGGCGGT studied by us recently (36). The structure of the GGCGG segment was found to be nearly similar in the two cases. The interesting feature of the structure is the C-tetrad in the middle of the quadruplex. In K Solutions at Low pH Lowering the pH of the K sample to 4.5 did not have much effect on the structure of the quadruplex as evidenced by the conserved NOE connectivity patterns. However, the chemical shifts of the base protons G3H8, C4H6, and C7H6 moved downfield by 0.25, 0.25, and 0.15 ppm respectively while the rest of the base protons were largely unaffected (Fig. 2a). This indicated that the central C-tetrad is probably getting protonated and due to the stacking of the C-tetrad over the adjacent G3-tetrad, the G3 base proton is also experiencing a deshielding effect. We may mention here that the C base has a much higher affinity for protons than any

implying thereby that the C4 base is well stacked over the adjacent G-tetrads in the quadruplex structure.

other cation and the pK of N3 nitrogen of C is around 5. However, the NMR spectra did not show the C characteristic peak at 15­16 ppm. This suggests that the proton is perhaps not sitting permanently at the N3 nitrogen site on the C base but is probably delocalised in the cavity of the C-tetrad. The cavity in the C-tetrad is lined by four oxygens and four nitrogens and this may facilitate the proton delocalisation. Such a delocalised proton may be represented by a charge at the center of the cavity as shown schematically in Fig. 2b. At pH 4.5 the H concentration is 0.1 mM which is less than the DNA concentration (0.25 mM) on four strand basis. This means, on the average there will be a mixture of protonated and non-protonated quadruplex structures in solution and the proton would be exchanging in and out of the quadruplex. Thus the observed chemical shifts would be weighted averages of the two structures. In Na Solutions at Neutral pH The 1D proton spectrum of the DNA in H 2O solution containing 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.1, 5°C (Fig. 4, top spectrum) does not show any spectral features characteristic of G-quadruplex structures as in the case of K containing solutions. On the contrary it shows G-imino resonances around 13.1 ppm which are very characteristic of Watson-Crick G:C pairing as seen most commonly in DNA duplexes. Assignment of the individual exchangeable and non exchangeable proton resonances could be readily obtained from sequential NOEs in 2D NOESY spectra and Fig. 3 shows the NOE connectivities from nonexchangeable base (H8/H6) protons to sugar (H2 , H2 ) protons as illustrations. The inset shows an NOE from C7NH 2 to T1CH 3, which is indicative of antiparallel orientation of the two interacting strands. The NOEs further indicate that all the nucleotides have glycosidic angles in the anti domain. Now, in the search for an acceptable structure for the DNA as per the above observations, one may be tempted to consider a quadruplex structure formed exclusively by GCGC tetrads having Watson-Crick GC pairs and antiparallel strand orientation, as has been reported earlier (28). However, the observation of uniform anti glycosidic angles for all the nucleotides is not compatible with such a proposition since that would require a combination of syn and anti glycosidic torsion angles (28) along the sequence of the molecule. Moreover, that would also introduce a two-fold asymmetry in the structure, and one would see two sets of correlations in the NOESY spectrum. But, as these are absent, it is evident that the molecule forms an antiparallel duplex with Watson-Crick GC pairs under the above experimental conditions. The formation of the duplex was also borne out by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (data not shown).

Continuous connectivities have been drawn in through the H2 and H8/H6 protons. The box indicates the position of the sequential cross peak at G6-G5 step which was seen at a higher mixing time (350 ms). The inset shows a peak from the H 2O spectrum which displays the C7NH 2-T1CH 3 correlation.

Two schemes are conceivable for the formation of an antiparallel duplex by TGGCGGC: 5 -TGGCGGC-3 3 -CGGCGGT-5 I 5 -TGGCGGC-3 3 -CGGCGGT-5 II

Scheme I contains four GC and two mismatch GG pairs where as scheme II contains two GC, two mismatch GG, and two mismatch GT pairs. In the NMR spectra at neutral pH there is no evidence for the formation of H-bonded GT pairs; T-imino protons would have different chemical shifts compared to G-iminos and one would observe NOEs between them in the event of a GT pair. Considering that scheme I has four GC pairs as opposed to two in scheme II, the former is expected to be the dominant contributor. In Na Solution at Low pH As the pH of the Na sample was progressively reduced, we noticed the appearance of a new species (Fig. 4) at the cost of the duplex. The G-imino peaks belonging to the duplex also shift slightly downfield. Eventually at pH 2.2 (H concentration 10 mM), the duplex completely vanishes. We also notice that the

FIG. 4. pH dependence of the TGGCGGC spectrum in Na solutions. The intensities of the various peaks in different spectra are not comparable as the DNA concentrations are not the same in all the cases. The downfield peak at 13 ppm represents the duplex and those at 9.5­12 ppm are attributed to the quadruplex.

resonances become progressively sharper with lowering of pH, indicating progressive population of a stable structure. The chemical shifts of the resonances belonging to the new species suggest that these belong to the imino protons ( 11­12 ppm) and amino protons ( 9.5­10.5 ppm) of the Gs in a quadruplex structure (see Fig. 1). Thus it appears that in the sequence TGGCGGC, H causes a transition from an antiparallel duplex to a quadruplex structure. However, the number of resonances in the imino region (Fig. 4) is more than what must be expected for a single parallel stranded quadruplex structure. This might mean coexistence of more than one symmetric quadruplex structures or an asymmetric quadruplex structure or both. The NOESY spectra (data not shown) while conforming to the quadruplex characteristics were, however, not well resolved to be able to delineate the details of the quadruplex structures. DISCUSSION We observed that the sequence d-TGGCGGC containing two triplet (GGC) repeats of Fragile X-Syndrome, formed a stable parallel stranded G-quadruplex in K solutions at neutral pH. We also observed that when the pH of this solution was lowered, the quadruplex was not disturbed (data not shown). In contrast, in solutions containing exclusively Na ions, the molecule formed a stable antiparallel duplex and no quadruplex at all. But when the pH of this solution was progressively lowered, we noticed a progressive transition from the duplex to a quadruplex structure. This process was found to be completely reversible. These observations are schematically summarized in Fig. 5. Now, under any experimental conditions, the population distribution of the different structures will be

determined by their individual relative thermodynamic stabilities. From extensive studies by various authors on different sequences, it is well known that K ions stabilize G-quadruplex structures more than the Na ions and in most cases the former can replace the latter but not vice versa. Thus in the present situation as well, a stable G-quadruplex structure is found in the presence of K ions. On the other hand, in Na solutions, the duplex is perhaps more stable than the quadruplex and thus the equilibrium at neutral pH is almost entirely in favour of the duplex. But when the pH of the solution is reduced, the H ions start playing a role. Protonation of the C base can occur which would destabilize the Watson-Crick GC pairs and hence the duplex. The downfield shift of the G-iminos belonging to the duplex at lower pH values is consistent with such a C protonation. Consequently, the quadruplex structure would get more populated by default. Further within the quadruplex, protonation of the C may stabilize the C-tetrad and this may further enhance the stability and hence the population of the quadruplex structure. As a consequence, progressive increase in the H ion concentration in the solution would progressively shift the equilibrium toward the quadruplex structure. While the above explanation of the pH effects is logical, the NMR data, however, as in the case of K solutions, did not show any signature of a protonated cytidine (peak around 15­16 ppm) even at pH 2.2. Thus, here again, it appears that the proton is most likely not sitting permanently at the nitrogen sites lining the C-tetrad but is rather delocalised. The reversibility of the duplex to quadruplex transition indicates that the proton can exchange in and out of the tetrad structure. The present results extend the previous work on DNA sequences containing GGC repeats and are very significant from the point of view of specific recognition. Conformational switching depending upon the environmental conditions can turn on and off enzymes, especially unwinding helicase enzymes. In the earlier studies, the sequences formed bimolecular anti parallel quadruplex structures with T-loops, and the G and C were involved in Watson Crick base pairing. In one

case a GCGC tetrad was formed in the presence of Na ions (28 ­29), but the same was not observed in solutions containing K ions (30). The glycosodic conformations of the Gs had a combination of syn and anti in the individual strands. In the present study the GGCGGC stretch forms a parallel stranded quadruplex in K solutions and the topology of the structure is very different. All the nucleotides have anti glycosidic conformations. The G and C nucleotides produce different functional groups on the surfaces of the quadruplex. The pH dependent reversible switches from quadruplex to duplex in Na solutions represent dramatic structural changes and would be very significant from the recognition and regulation points of view. We may also mention in this context that the closely related sequence d-TGGGCGGT investigated by us earlier (36), formed a stable parallel stranded quadruplex structure in Na solutions at neutral pH and did not exhibit the kind of pH dependent transitions seen presently in d-TGGCGGC. These observations point to the significance of the basic repeat sequence vis-a-vis the ` environmental conditions, especially the cations, in the polymorphism of the DNA structures. ACKNOWLEDGMENT
