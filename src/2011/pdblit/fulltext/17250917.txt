Abstract Hydroxynitrile lyase from Hevea brasiliensis (HbHNL) was purified to apparent homogeneity. Purified HbHNL consists of non-covalently linked monomers of 30 kDa. HbHNL exhibits a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K,,, of 115 mM and the enzyme activity is strongly inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and diethyl pyrocarbonate indicating a serine and histidine in the active site. HbHNL is serologically related to the HNL from Manihot esculentu but not to other HNLs.

1. Introduction

Hydroxynitrile lyases catalyze the decomposition of cr-hydroxynitriles into HCN and carbonyl compounds [ 11. These enzymes are described for several species of cyanogenic plants [2,3], where they are involved in the catabolism of cyanogenic
hbbreviurions:DEP, diethyl pyrocarbonate; DFP, diiso-

propyl fluorophosphate; HbHNL, hydroxynitrile Iyase from
Hevea brasiliensis (EC 4.2.1.-); LuHNL, hydroxynitrile lyase from Linum usitatissimum (EC 4.2.1.-); MeHNL, hydroxynitrile lyase from Manibotesculenta(EC 4.1.2.37); PaHNL, hydroxynitrile lyase from Prunus amygdalum (EC 4.1.2.11); SbHNL,

hydroxynitrile lyase from Sorghum bicolor (EC 4.1.2. I I). * Corresponding author, Tel.: 49 71 I 685 7446; Fax: 49 711

glycosides during cyanogenesis [Z] and/or in the metabolism of these compounds during seedling development [4,5]. All HNLs described so far have in common an isoelectric point of about 4.5 and a pH optimum between 4.5 and 5.5 [2,3]. However, with respect to biochemical properties like molecular mass, subunit composition, glycosylation, FAD content, substrate specificity and stereoselectivity, they form a highly heterogenous group of enzymes [6]. Recently, the HNLs from Prunus serotina [7], Manihot esculenta [8] and Sorghum bicolor [6] were cloned. There are no obvious sequence homologies among these three enzymes. Whereas the proteins from Prunes serotina and Manihot esculenta, respectively, possess limited or no homologies to other known proteins [7,8],

SbHNL show extended homologies to serine carboxypeptidases [6]. In particular, SbHNL shares the catalytical triad Asp, His and Ser with these enzymes. This catalytical triad evolved in three groups of proteases (carboxypeptidase, chymotrypsin and subtilisin group) by convergent evolution [9,10]. Taking into account the overall biochemical heterogeneity and the lack of sequence homologies between the three cloned HNLs, convergent evolution in this group of enzymes also appears conceivable. In the last number of years HNLs have become more and more attractive to organic chemistry due to their potential use in the stereoselective synthesis of chiral cyanohydrins. Especially PaHNL and SbHNL have been extensively characterized with respect to their potential use as biocatalysts [ll-131. Here we describe the purification and characterization of HbHNL. This HNL is very similar to the recently described HNL from Ma&hot escufenta with respect to biochemical and serological properties, but is clearly different from all other HNLs. 2.

homogenized by mortar and pestle. The powder was suspended in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.4 (15 ml/g dried weight) and squeezed through several layers of cheese cloth. The remaining debris was again extracted twice with sodium acetate buffer. The resulting filtrates were combined and centrifuged at 40 000 x g for 30 min in a Ti 45 rotor. In order to concentrate proteins, solid (NH&S04 was added over 30 min to the filtrate bringing it to a salt concentration yielding 40% saturation. The precipitate which formed after 1 h at RT was collected by centrifugation (20 000 x g, 20 min, 4°C) and discarded. Subsequently, additional (NH&SO4 was dissolved to obtain a solution of 80% saturation. The precipitate which formed after 30 min at RT was collected by centrifugation (20 000 x g, 20 min, 4°C) and dissolved in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.4. After dialyzing against three changes of 25 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.4 and centrifugation (20 000 x g, 20 min, 4"C), the extract was concentrated 50-100 times using an Amicon cell (PM 10 filter). Finally HbHNL was purified by FPLC techniques as follows. 2.3.1. Gel filtration chromatography on Supera'ex

Anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q at pH 7.8 Fractions from anion exchange chromatography on Q-sepharose FF with high specific activity were pooled, diluted 1:10 with 40 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.8 and loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/mm on a Mono Q HR 5/5 (Pharmacia), which has been equilibrated with 40 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.8. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from O-O.5 M NaCl in 40 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.8 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/mm. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed for enzyme activity. 2.4. SDS-PAGE SDS-PAGE was performed in the `Mighty small gel system' (Hoefer Scientific Co.) with a l-mm thick 13.5% polyacrylamide gel as described by Laemmli [ 151. Samples were prepared in the presence of 100 mM dithiothreitol and 1% SDS by boiling for 5 mm. The gels were silver-stained according to Blum [ 161. 2.5. Inhibition studies The effect of diisopropyl fluorophosphate and diethyl pyrocarbonate on the purified enzyme was examined as follows: 15 ~1 of enzyme (25 ng/pl) was incubated with 15 ~1 of inhibitor at various concentrations in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.4 at 23°C for 40 min. The enzyme assay was started by addition of 1.5 ~1 of a 50-fold dilution of re-distilled acetone cyanohydrin (Aldrich).

2.6. Immunoblotting Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) by the method of Towbin et al. [17]. The immunoblots were further processed as described elsewhere [6]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Purification of hydroxynitrile lyase from Hevea
brasiliensis

We have purified hydroxynitrile

lyase from

Hevea brasiliensis (HbHNL) to homogeneity. The

results of a typical preparation are shown in Table 1 in which a 106-fold purification with 29% yield is obtained. The final HbHNL preparation has a specific activity of 87 U/mg at room temperature. The specific activity of HbHNL is comparable to the specific activity of HNL from Manihot esculenta (91.6 U/mg) [ 181and 3-fold higher than the specific activity of HNL from Linum usitatissimum (34.1 U/mg) [19]. Like HbHNL these HNLs also utilize acetone cyanohydrin and 2-butanone cyanohydrin as natural substrates. Compared to flavoprotein hydroxynitrile lyases from the Rosaceae family, the specific activity of HbHNL is rather low, but it is in the range of other HNLs containing no FAD. 3.2. Physical characterization of HbHNL HbHNL was found to migrate in SDS-PAGE with a mobility corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 30 000. A single band was found both under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. l), suggesting that HbHNL possesses no in-

termolecular disultide bonds. These data together with data from gel filtration, suggesting a native molecular weight between 100 000-105 000 (Fig. l), indicate that HbHNL is a homotri- or homotetramer. Like most other HNLs, HbHNL contains no FAD (data not shown). Nevertheless, with respect to molecular weight, subunit composition and glycosylation, HbHNL is different from most other non-flavoprotein HNLs, which are heterotetrameric (SbHNL) [20], homodimeric (LuHNL) [19] or monomeric [3] holoenzymes. However, there is considerably more biochemical similarity between HbHNL and MeHNL. Both enzymes are homomers [8,18] of non-glycosylated [8] (data not shown) 30 kDa subunits which can stereoselectively convert (S)-cyanohydrins [21]. The pH optimum of HbHNL using the natural substrate acetone cyanohydrin was between 5.3 and 5.7 (data not shown). A more accurate determination of the pH optimum was difficult due to the increasingly rapid base-catalyzed spontaneous decomposition of acetone cyanohydrin at pH

values above 5.5. Therefore, HbHNL can effectively accelerate the dissociation of acetone cyanohydrin in damaged tissue of Hevea brasiliensis where the pH is slightly acidic [5]. The physiological importance of rapid cyanogenesis is shown by the fact that only hevea plants possessing high HNL concentrations are able to release HCN eEficiently. Therefore, repellent action of cyanogenic hevea plants depends on both the final level of HCN as well as the rate of acetone cyanohydrin cleavage [5]. 3.3. Kinetic characterization of HbHNL The substrate saturation curve of HbHNL has been determined using acetone cyanohydrin and purified enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2, HbHNL exhibits a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K,,, of 115 mM. This K,,, is almost the same as determined for HNL from Manihot esculenta [8], but differs significantly from all other known HNLs. As discussed elsewhere for MeHNL [8], the

In Western blotting experiments HbHNL reacts only with the anti-MeHNL antisera (Fig. 3), emphasizing the high overall similarity between these two HNLs. Therefore, we suggest that these enzymes, which are both isolated from members of the Euphorbiaceae family, arose from a common ancestor, whereas the other HNLs evolved independently from several other ancestors as discussed elsewhere [6]. 3.5.

To investigate the immunological relationship of HbHNL to other HNLs 200 ng of enzyme were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and treated with antisera against MeHNL, SbHNL, PaHNL or LuHNL. A sample of 100 ng of the appropriate purified enzyme served as internal positive control. The final dilution of antisera was 1:lOOO.Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse (IgG+lgM) antibody (1:ZOOO) and carbaxole as substrate.

We have therefore examined the effect of two known protease inhibitors, DFP (active site serine reagent) and DEP (active site histidine reagent), on the activity of HbHNL. As shown in Table 2, we found pronounced inhibition of enzyme activity by both-agents, indicating the involvement of these residues in the active site of HbHNL. It seems that all HNLs employ a common catalytic mechanism despite their obvious differences in primary structure and biochemical properties. Determination of the three dimensional structure and site-directed mutagenesis of the recently cloned HNLs from cassava, sorghum and black cherry should help to clarify the functional importance of serine and histidine residues for HNLcatalyzed cleavage of cyanohydrins.
