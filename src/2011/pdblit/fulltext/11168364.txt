Several complementary NMR approaches were used to study the interaction of mastoparan, a 14-residue peptide toxin from wasp venom, with lipid membranes. First, the 3D structure of mastoparan was determined using 1H-NMR spectroscopy in perdeuterated (SDS-d25) micelles. NOESY experiments and distance geometry calculations yielded a straight amphiphilic a-helix with high-order parameters, and the chemical shifts of the amide protons showed a characteristic periodicity of 3±4 residues. Secondly, solidstate 2H-NMR spectoscopy was used to describe the binding of mastoparan to lipid bilayers, composed of headgroup-deuterated dimyristoylglycerophosphocholine (DMPC-d4) and dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG). By correlating the deuterium quadrupole splittings of the a-segments and b-segments, it was possible to differentiate the electrostatically induced structural response of the choline headgroup from dynamic effects induced by the peptide. A partial phase separation was observed, leading to

a DMPG-rich phase and a DMPG-depleted phase, each containing some mastoparan. Finally, the insertion and orientation of a specifically 15N-labeled mastoparan (at position Ala10) in the bilayer environment was investigated by solid-state 15N-NMR spectroscopy, using macroscopically oriented samples. Two distinct orientational states were observed for the mastoparan helix, namely an in-plane and a trans-membrane alignment. The two populations of 90% in-plane and 10% trans-membrane helices are characterized by a mosaic spread of ^ 308 and ^ 108, respectively. The biological activity of mastoparan is discussed in terms of a pore-forming model, as the peptide is known to be able to induce nonlamellar phases and facilitate a flip-flop between the monolayers. Keywords: amphiphilic peptide; isotope labeling; lipid bilayer; mastoparan; NMR spectroscopy.

Membrane-active peptides exhibit many interesting biological and pharmacological activities. The amphiphilic structure of such peptides is known to be an important requirement for their adsorption to, insertion into, and translocation across lipid bilayers [1]. Many functional peptides form a helical structure in a lipid environment, which can be aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the membrane surface [2±5]. The presence of a peptide may also influence the orientation and mobility of the lipid

molecules. For example, the 31P chemical-shift anisotropy (CSA) of phospholipids, which is a useful indicator of the membrane environment, is known to be reduced on adding various peptides [6,7]. Alterations in the CSA may be attributed to changes in the order of the lipid molecules, the amplitude of headgroup motion, or the headgroup orientation [7±10]. Recently, we used solid-state 31P-NMR spectroscopy to study the perturbing effect of the wasp venom peptide mastoparan (14 amino acids) on lipid bilayers composed of 1,2-dimyristoylglycerophosphocholine (DMPC) and 1,2dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) [11]. Changes in the 31P CSA of multilamellar vesicles indicated that mastoparan interacts strongly and preferentially with the charged DMPG headgroup. In addition, macroscopically oriented mastoparan±lipid samples showed the coexistence of orientation-dependent lamellar signals together with an orientation-independent isotropic peak, suggesting that mastoparan is able to induce nonlamellar phases in DMPC/DMPG mixtures. With regard to its biological activity, mastoparan is known to stimulate the release of histamine from mast cells. It has also been shown to directly activate pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in vitro, in a manner similar to G-protein-coupled receptors [12, 13]. Therefore, mastoparan

seems to be capable of passing rapidly through the cell membrane to interact with cytoplasmic proteins. It may be speculated that the negative-inside membrane potential of a living cell may be a major driving force for the translocation of positively charged peptides [14,15]. Nevertheless, in model vesicles and planar lipid bilayers similar effects of mastoparan have also been observed, such as membrane permeabilization and formation of ion channels [16±18]. For example, a transbilayer movement of ions and lipids was induced by a mastoparan analog (mastoparan-X) in vesicles consisting of negatively charged and zwitterionic lipids. Likewise, coupling of peptide translocation with pore formation has been proposed to explain the efflux of a self-quenching dye from large unilamellar vesicles [14]. Mastoparan undergoes a conformational change on moving from an aqueous environment into the lipid phase. The CD spectrum suggests a largely disordered structure in water, whereas in the presence of phospholipids it is characteristic of an amphiphilic a-helix [19]. The location of mastoparan in lipid bilayers has been investigated using solution-state NMR in bilayer mimic `bicelles' [20]. However, there is no detailed information about the conformational flexibility and helical orientation of mastoparan in mixed lipid bilayers, nor about the dynamic aspects of membrane penetration. In this work we use solid-state 15N-NMR and 2H-NMR spectroscopy, supported by 1H-NMR in solution, to study the orientational and conformational behavior of mastoparan in lipid bilayers and detergent micelles, respectively. First, it was confirmed that mastoparan assumes an amphiphilic a-helical structure in all bilayer-mimetic environments accessible to 1H-NMR. 2H-NMR of headgroup-deuterated DMPC-d4 was then used to describe the interaction of the positively charged peptide with pure DMPC and with mixed DMPC/DMPG bilayers. Finally, a peptide with a single 15N-label at the 10th residue was synthesized and incorporated into macroscopically oriented DMPC/DMPG bilayers. Solid-state 15N-NMR spectroscopy of oriented samples is one of the most powerful techniques for investigating peptide±lipid interactions, because the orientation of a helical peptide in the bilayer environment can be determined from the 15N CSA. The alignment of various membrane-active peptides has been described this way, e.g. for gramicidin A [21], alamethicin [22], and melittin [23]. In the present study, we analyze the orientation of specifically 15N-labeled mastoparan in lipid bilayers, using the approach that we originally developed to determine the structure of macroscopically oriented fibrous proteins [24, 25].

mastoparan. [15N]Ala-mastoparan (Ile-Asn-Leu-Lys-AlaLeu-Ala-Ala-Leu-Ala-Lys-Lys-Ile-Leu-NH2) was synthesized by stepwise elongation of Fmoc-amino acids on to Fmoc-NH-SAL resin [4-(2 H ,4 H -dimethoxyphenylfluorenylaminomethyl)phenoxy] as previously described [11]. NMR sample preparation For 1H-NMR measurements in solution, 5 mm mastoparan was dissolved in 50 mm perdeuterated SDS (SDS-d25) with 10% D2O. For solid-state 15N-NMR, [15N]Ala10-labeled mastoparan was cosolubilized with DMPC and DMPG in the molar proportions 10 : 70 : 30 in methanol/chloroform (1 : 1, v/v). The solution was spread on 0.1-mm-thick glass plates (5 Â 9 mm) and dried under vacuum overnight. The plates were then stacked in a sample tube (6.5 mm external diameter Â 20 mm length), and distilled H2O was added to achieve 60% hydration by weight. The tube with the oriented plates was sealed with a Teflon cap and epoxide resin before being incubated at 45 8C for 1±2 weeks [7]. For solid-state 2H-NMR, 2 mg DMPC-d4 (diluted with additional unlabeled DMPC) was cosolubilized either with DMPG (at DMPC/DMPG molar ratios of 70 : 30 and 90 : 10), with mastoparan (at a mastoparan/DMPC molar ratio of 10 : 90), or with mastoparan plus DMPG (mastoparan/DMPC/DMPG, 10 : 70 : 30), and treated as above. Determination of NMR structure in solution NOESY spectra of mastoparan in detergent micelles were recorded at 30 8C on a JEOL a-500 spectrometer, using 5000 Hz spectral width, 1024 Â 256 points, a mixing time tm  100 ms, and 32 scans per increment. TOCSY spectra of the same sample were acquired on a JEOL a-600 NMR spectrometer, using an MLEV-17 pulse scheme with a mixing time of 10 ms, 8000 Hz spectral width, 1024 Â 256 points, 1.8 s recycle delay, and 256 scans. The water signal was eliminated by presaturation. The time domain data were multiplied in both t1 and t2 dimensions by a shifted sine-squared window function and expanded by zero-filling to give 1024 Â 1024 frequency domain data points. The chemical shift was referenced to HDO at 4.77 p.p.m. For the structure calculation, NOE restraints were obtained by classifying NOESY cross-peak intensities into three categories based on counting the contour levels. These classes were then assigned to appropriate distances by comparing the cross-peak intensities with those arising from known fixed distances within residues and with maximum geometrically achievable distances (assuming that the longest distance for which an NOE could be observed is Ê 4.5 A). The resulting classes of NOEs and restraints were: Ê Ê Ê strong (, 2.5 A), medium (, 3.0 A), and weak (, 4.5 A). The NMR data were processed with Felix950 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Molecular modeling was performed with Insight II 95.0 (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The solution structure of the peptide was calculated by MSI NMRchitect DGII, which utilizes a hybrid-simulated annealing/distance geometry protocol [26]. The convergence of the calculated structures was evaluated in terms of the structural parameters, i.e. rms deviations, from experimental distance. The degree of angular variation among the converged structures was

Solid-state NMR measurements H-NMR spectra were recorded at 35 8C on a JEOL-400EX spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 61.25 MHz, or alternatively on a 500-MHz widebore Varian Unity Inova spectrometer with a static 5-mm solenoid coil. The quadrupole echo pulse sequence (908x ±t2908y± t±echo) was used, with an interval of t  34 ms, 908 pulse length of 3.4 ms, and a recycle delay of 0.5 s. Solid-state 15N-NMR spectra were recorded at 40.4 MHz on the JEOL-400-EX spectrometer, equipped with a 7-mm inner-diameter coil. Cross-polarization was used, and highpower 1H decoupling during the signal-acquisition period. Typical NMR parameters were 6.4 ms, 908 pulse length, 1-ms cross-polarization time, 3 s recycle delay, and 24 000 scans for the oriented sample. The 15N chemical shifts were referenced to 15NH4NO3 by setting the signal of solid 15 NH4Cl to 18.0 p.p.m. Spectral simulations for the 15N CSA analysis were carried out on a UNIX workstation (Silicon Graphics Indy R4400) using a fortran 77 program, as previously described [25].

Conformation of mastoparan in detergent micelles Even though mastoparan does not possess any secondary structure in aqueous solution, CD measurements suggest an a-helical conformation in the presence of detergent micelles (data not shown). Hence we determined the structure of mastoparan by 1H-NMR in a solution of SDS-d25. The NOESY and TOCSY spectra show that mastoparan adopts an a-helical conformation, exhibiting the typical pattern of NN (i, i 1 1), NN (i, i 1 2), aN (i, i 1 3), and aN (i, i 1 4) cross-peaks, and no aN (i, i 1 2) cross-peaks. All cross-peaks detected in the NOESY experiments and the assignments based on the TOCSY and NOESY analysis are summarized in Fig. 1. The sign of all NOESY cross-peaks is negative, suggesting that the small peptides bind to larger detergent micelles [28]. The chemical-shift index [29] of the a-protons is also indicative of an a-helical conformation between the 4th and 12th residue (Fig. 1). The NOE restrained conformation of mastoparan was obtained from the present data by computer calculation, using 91 distance constraints, 56 of which were from neighboring residues. The 10 lowest-energy structures selected from 100 refined solutions, with the lowest Ê Ê rmsd  0.27 A for the backbone and 0.81 A for heavy atoms were obtained. As expected from the NOE and chemical-shift index patterns shown in Fig. 1, the peptide backbone is well converged and possesses an a-helical conformation. In particular, the dihedral order parameters S(c, f) from c of the 3rd residue up to f of the 12th are

quite high (. 0.98), indicating a low degree of flexibility. In contrast, the S values for the N-terminal and C-terminal residues range from 0.82 to 0.2 because of an increased angular freedom. The amino-acid sequence of mastoparan provides the regular a-helix with an amphiphilic character, as the three lysine residues in positions 4, 11 and 12 are located on almost the same face, while the hydrophobic Ile, Leu, and Ala are located on the opposite side. A distinct oscillation of the sequential NH chemical-shift differences (relative to random-coil shifts) is apparent from the NMR data (Fig. 2, solid line). Similar NH chemical shifts (included in Fig. 2, dashed line) have also been reported for mastoparan in an isotropic solution of DMPC/ dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine bicelles, used as a bilayer mimetic [20]. The close agreement between these two independent sets of data suggests that mastoparan will also assume a similar a-helical conformation with a low degree of flexibility when embedded in genuine phospholipid bilayers. Perturbation of DMPC/DMPG bilayers by mastoparan The binding of mastoparan to lipid bilayers was monitored by 2H-NMR spectoscopy of headgroup-deuterated DMPC-d4 in the presence and absence of DMPG and

mastoparan. The resolution of the a and b quadrupole splittings was enhanced by measuring macroscopically oriented samples. In the case of pure DMPC-d4 (Fig. 3A), the a and b methylene segments have equivalent splittings of 11.7 kHz, while the mixture of DMPC-d4/DMPG (molar ratio 70 : 30, Fig. 3B) exhibits different splittings of 17.6 and 6.7 kHz, respectively. When 10% mastoparan is added (mastoparan/DMPC/DMPG, 10 : 70 : 30; Fig. 3C), the two splittings are reduced to 11.2 and 6.4 kHz, respectively. For a quantitative analysis, two different kinds of effect have to be taken into account. On the one hand, the a and b splittings are known to change counter-directionally when charged molecules interact with DMPC-d4, because the zwitterionic headgroup responds like an electrostatic sensor by changing its tilt angle [30±32]. On the other hand, the presence of membrane-active peptides often leads to an overall reduction in the width of the 31P CSA because of increased motional averaging [6, 7]. This dynamic effect would decrease the 2H-NMR quadrupole splittings of both the a and b segments of DMPC-d4. To discriminate between electrostatic and dynamic effects, we first analyzed the changes in the 31P CSA of DMPC and DMPC/DMPG bilayers on binding of mastoparan, using our previously published data [11]. Figure 4A shows that the CSA values decrease almost linearly with the addition of mastoparan up to a molar ratio of 10%. The 2 H-NMR quadrupole splittings of pure DMPC-d4 decrease with a very similar slope, and the a and b splittings remain indistinguishable. Hence, the presence of mastoparan leads to an increased motional averaging of the lipid headgroups, in both pure DMPC and DMPC/DMPG (70 : 30). Even the acyl chains of the lipid bilayer become more `fluid' in the

The 2H-NMR quadrupole splittings (right scale, dashed line) of headgroup deuterated DMPC-d4 are reduced to the same extent (a and b remain equivalent), hence the choline and phosphate groups respond by a similar increase in motional averaging.

presence of mastoparan, as the quadrupole splittings of DMPC-d4 are observed to decrease as well (data not shown). We conclude that the response of DMPC to the binding of mastoparan is dominated by dynamic effects, although the negatively charged lipids may show further electrostatic interactions. To verify the concept of the choline headgroup as an electrostatic charge sensor [30±32], we investigated the response of DMPC-d4 to the stepwise addition of negatively charged DMPG. Figure 4B shows

DMPC-d4 towards the combined addition of mastoparan plus DMPG therefore suggests that a partial phase separation has occurred in this mixed lipid±peptide system. The 2H-NMR data suggest that roughly one-third of mastoparan and DMPG are clustered together in DMPG-rich domains, such that our reporter molecule DMPC-d4 can `sense' only the remaining part of the bilayer which is partially depleted of the charged lipids and peptides. The results of 2H-NMR experiments in this study are in agreement with previously published results showing that mastoparan interacts preferentially with DMPG and triggers formation of phosphatidylglycerol-enriched clusters or domains [14,16]. Orientational behavior of mastoparan in DMPC/DMPG bilayers To study the orientation of mastoparan in DMPC/DMPG bilayers, solid-state 15N-NMR spectra were recorded of [15N]Ala10-mastoparan embedded in macroscopically oriented membranes between glass plates (Fig. 6). When the sample normal is oriented parallel to B0 (u  08), the resonance frequency can be analyzed in terms of the local orientation of the 15N CSA tensor. Our 15N-NMR spectrum shows two broad peaks at 162 and 68 p.p.m. (Fig. 6, spectrum c), suggesting that the peptide is present in two orientations in DMPC/DMPG, namely in a trans-membrane and an in-plane alignment. When interpreting the broad lineshape of the oriented sample as a two-component spectrum, it is crucial to exclude the possibility that it could represent a distorted powder pattern. First of all, the oriented sample shows a clear angular dependence, i.e. when recorded at u  908 (Fig. 6, spectrum b). The latter lineshape also confirms that the central dip of Fig. 6 spectrum c is not an artefact arising from inefficient crosspolarization as mentioned in other 15N-NMR studies of peptides [33]. Secondly, the oriented lineshape (Fig. 6, spectrum c) differs significantly from the genuine powder spectrum (Fig. 6, spectrum a). Furthermore, our recent 31 P-NMR spectrum of the oriented sample showed hardly any powder contribution, but instead demonstrated that mastoparan can induce a nonlamellar phase in DMPC/ DMPG (7 : 3) bilayers [11]. Finally, the 2H-NMR data above (Figs 3 and 4) suggest partial phase separation between the lipids and peptide within the bilayer. Hence we assume that our 15N-NMR analysis does indeed represent two populations of mastoparan with different alignments in the bilayer, which may correlate with a nonuniform distribution of the peptide between different lipid domains. As mastoparan (except for its N-terminal and C-terminal residues) adopts a stable a-helical conformation under all bilayer-mimetic conditions tested, we attribute the broad 15 N-NMR linewidth to a large mosaic spread of the helix rods in the bilayer rather than to a conformational change within the helix. To estimate the mosaic spread of the two peptide populations, spectral lineshapes were simulated with the CSA tensor elements (s11  30 p.p.m., s22  59 p.p.m. and s33  207 p.p.m.) observed from the powder pattern (Fig. 6, spectrum a). Euler angles aF and bF are used to describe the transformation of the CSA tensor orientation from the principal axis system to the bilayer axis system for each orientational fraction, and these are fitted to a Gaussian distribution of axis orientations as shown in Fig. 6, spectrum d), according to our

Fig. 5. Correlation analysis of the a and b quadrupole splittings of headgroup-deuterated DMPC-d4, in the presence of mastoparan (K), in the presence of DMPG (L), and in the presence of both mastoparan and DMPG (V). The intersection of the dotted lines and the dotted arrow illustrates the expected change if all molecules were perfectly miscible in the ternary system. The experimental data fall short of this change, indicating that a partial phase separation has occurred, in which about one-third of mastoparan and DMPG have been sequestered from the DMPC-rich phase.

that the a and b splittings change linearly and counterdirectionally up to a molar ratio of 30% DMPG. Hence, the tilt angle of the zwitterionic DMPC headgroup is structurally affected by the presence of DMPG, whereas there is no significant change in headgroup dynamics. Using the data in Fig. 4, the interaction of mastoparan with mixed DMPC/DMPG bilayers can now be analyzed in a quantitative manner, by correlating the observed a and b quadrupole splittings of DMPC-d4 with one another. The two arrows in Fig. 5 illustrate the respective changes due to an electrostatic response and due to a change in mobility. Starting with pure DMPC-d4, the addition of DMPG leads to a counter-directional change in the a and b splittings, as marked by the solid arrow. The slope of m  20.87 is in good agreement with literature values on similar lipid mixtures [31]. In contrast, the interaction of pure DMPC-d4 with 10% mastoparan leads to a codirectional change in the a and b splittings, as marked by the dashed arrow pointing towards the origin. The change in dynamics is thus represented by a vector that lies practically at a right angle with regard to the vector representing the electrostatic response. The combined effects of 10% mastoparan plus 70% DMPG can now be predicted, provided that the molecules are ideally miscible and that the mode of mastoparan insertion is unaffected by the type of lipid. If the dynamic and electrostatic effects are simply additive, the resulting a and b splittings would be expected to appear at the point of intersection of the two dotted lines, as indicated by the dotted arrow. Instead, however, our experimental data for mastoparan/DMPC-d4 /DMPG (10 : 70 : 30) fall short of the expected change and reach only about two-thirds of the full length of the dotted arrow.

previous report [25]. The optimized fractions for the two peaks at low and high field are 10% and 90%, with orientational distributions of ^ 108 and ^ 308, respectively. These fractions indicate that most of the mastoparan peptides are oriented with their helix axis parallel to the membrane surface with a relatively large mosaicity, while only about 10% are in a trans-membrane alignment with relatively high order.

DISCUSSION
The NOE-restrained 1H-NMR structure of mastoparan in the presence of detergent micelles represents a straight a-helix, for which the dihedral order parameters S are quite high. In contrast, the solution structure of mastoparan-X bound to G protein without lipid detergents has been shown to possess slightly lower-order parameters [34], suggesting

that the hydrophobic environment in a detergent micelle is more effective in stabilizing the amphiphilic conformation of mastoparan. A similar well-defined solution structure of the M2 peptide, which corresponds to the transmembrane fragment of acetylcholine receptor, within dodecylphosphocholine micelles [35] supports this notion. The amide proton chemical shifts show the same characteristic periodicity in detergent micelles as in phospholipid bicelles (Fig. 2). Hence we assume that mastoparan also possesses a well-defined conformation and high stability in phospholipid bilayers, the most representative biological model of which we consider to be a 70 : 30 mixture of DMPC/ DMPC. To analyze the interaction of positively charged mastoparan with DMPC/DMPG bilayers by 2H-NMR spectroscopy, dynamic effects had to be deconvoluted from the electrostatic response of the zwitterionic DMPC-d4 headgroup used here as a reporter. First, we noted that the binding of mastoparan to lipid bilayers increases the motional averaging of the lipid molecules, narrowing both the 31P CSA and the 2H-NMR spectra of the deuterated headgroup and chains. By correlating the choline a and b quadrupole splittings with one another, it could be demonstrated that mastoparan induces partial phase separation in mixed DMPC/DMPG (70 : 30) bilayers (Figs 3 and 4). Hence, some peptide accumulates in DMPG-enriched domains, while the rest remains in a DMPG-depleted phase. Given this nonuniform distribution, the peptide may exhibit different orientational behavior depending on its immediate lipid environment. The alignment of the peptide in the mixed lipid bilayer was evaluated from solid-state 15N-NMR of Ala10-labelled mastoparan (Fig. 6). Our data suggest that mastoparan coexists in two kinds of orientational states, aligned with its helix axis parallel and perpendicular to the bilayer normal. The trans-membrane and in-plane populations correspond to 10% and 90% under our experimental conditions, and they are characterized by orientational distributions of ^ 108 and ^ 308, respectively. Notably, the trans-membrane population of mastoparan is defined by a narrower linewidth and smaller mosaic spread, suggesting a more ordered alignment of the trans-membrane peptides in the hydrophobic bilayer interior. Previous solid-state 15N-NMR studies have successfully yielded the precise structures of gramicidin A [21], the four-helix bundle formed by the M2 protein channel of influenza A [36], and alamethicin [22], all of which are aligned trans-membrane. The reported linewidth of the oriented M2 bundle in DMPC of 17±25 p.p.m. at halfheight was quite large compared with analogous data from gramicidin A [21], but this could be explained in terms of some conformational or orientational heterogeneity. When compared with trans-membrane helices, however, peripherally bound peptides appear to have even larger mosaic spreads. For example, [15N]-Ile-labeled magainin was found to be oriented parallel to the bilayer surface with a mosaic spread of ^ 358 [37], which is similar to the orientational distribution determined here for the in-plane population of mastoparan (^ 308). Similarly, when the signal sequence of the M13 coat protein was studied in lipid bilayers by 15N-NMR, the peptide was found to lie predominantly in-plane but with a very broad orientational distribution [33].

The mastoparan±lipid interaction has been interpreted in terms of a pore-forming model, based on the dose±response curve of peptide-induced ion permeation [14]. MastoparanX induces a transbilayer movement of both negatively charged and zwitterionic lipid probes at peptide/lipid ratios above 0.01. The flip-flop of a negatively charged fluorescent probe [N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)dipalmitoyl]phosphatidylethanolamine on a time scale of minutes was slightly faster than that of a zwitterionic probe 1palmitoyl-2-(6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl)phosphatidylcholine. In the proposed `poremediated flip-flop', the lipids participate in the pore structure by lining it with their headgroups, which brings the outer and inner monolayers into a continuum [1]. As the lipid molecules are able to diffuse freely in a pore-mediated continuum, the 31P-NMR spectra are expected to show an isotropic component. In fact, we have recently observed that mastoparan can induce a nonlamellar phase in DMPC/ DMPG bilayers under certain conditions [11]. Therefore, together with our previous report, our current 2H-NMR and 15 N-NMR data suggest that two orientational states of mastoparan can coexist in DMPC/DMPG, although these two populations may have a wide distribution of lifetimes on the NMR time scale and may be further complicated by a partial phase separation of the mixed lipids. To describe the biological activity of a membrane-active peptide, it is essential to have some information on its orientation relative to the bilayer. It is known that the alignment of amphiphilic channel-forming peptides such as alamethicin and melittin is quite sensitive to the physical state of the bilayer. In dry or partially hydrated (30%, w/w water) multilayers, the alamethicin helices have been shown to partition into the bilayer, orienting themselves parallel to the bilayer normal [38]. In fully hydrated lipids, on the other hand, the melittin helices can also orient parallel to the plane of the bilayer, at an interfacial location [39]. Furthermore, even when the bilayer is sufficiently hydrated, a lowering of the temperature below the lipidphase transition forces the melittin helix out of the bilayer. Therefore, the free-energy difference between the two orientations is not very large, and it may be further influenced by a change in the transbilayer potential or by the lipid/peptide ratio [2]. The mastoparan-induced nonbilayer lipid phases observed in a previous 31P-NMR study [11], the partial phase separation observed by 2H-NMR of the current samples, and the multiple orientations of mastoparan in the mixed lipids observed here by 15N-NMR all support the idea that mastoparan is able to switch from an in-plane to a trans-membrane orientation. This structural change may correlate with its ability to induce a nonbilayer phase in DMPC/DMPG, similar to the proposed mechanism for melittin [40]. The concerted response of both the peptide and the lipid molecules may thus be biologically relevant in terms of pore formation and translocation of mastoparan across the membrane.
