Abstract An acidic phospholipase A2 (EC-I-PLA2) has been puri®ed from the Indian saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus ) venom through a combination of column chromatography and electrophoresis. EC-I-PLA2 has a molecular weight of 16000 by SDS-PAGE. It was focussed between pH 4.2 and 4.8 by isoelectro focussing. EC-I-PLA2 was non-lethal to mice and devoid of neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, anticoagulant activity and cytotoxicity. It induced mild oedema in the foot pads of mice. The puri®ed PLA2 inhibited ADP, collagen and epinephrine induced human platelet aggregation and the inhibition was both dose and time dependent. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

products are fatty acids and lysophosphoglycerides (Dennis, 1983). The multimolecular forms of PLA2 are widely distributed in nature. The richest sources of PLA2 are the exocrine secretions of mammalian pancreas and the venom of snakes and bees. It is not surprising therefore that the best characterized PLA2 have been isolated from these sources. PLA2 enzymes from pancreas and snake venoms undoubtedly serve a digestive function. However, in addition, the latter have evolved into lethal toxins with target speci®c actions. Hence, these induce a spectrum of pharmacological eects such as pre or postsynaptic neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, initiation or inhibition of platelet aggregation, haemolytic, convulsant, hypotensive, anticoagulant and oedema inducing activities (Kini and Evans, 1989, and references therein). The saw-scaled vipers (genus Echis ) have an extensive geographical distribution (for references see Gillissen et al., 1994). Their venom is a complex mixture of predominantly high molecular weight proteins, peptide toxins and glycoproteins (Desmond et al., 1991). There are reports on the variation in the composition of their venom due to geographical distribution. (Iddon et al., 1988; Gillissen et al., 1994). Their bites primarily cause severe bleeding and haemorrhage. Several biologically active components have been isolated and studied from their venoms (for references see Gillissen et al., 1994). However, information regarding the PLA2 enzymes of Echis venoms is limited. In the present study we report the puri®cation and characterization of a platelet aggregation inhibitor PLA2 from Indian saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus ) venom. 2. Materials and methods Lyophilized Echis carinatus venom was purchased from Irula Snake Catcher's, Madras, India. CM-Sephadex C-25 (4.5 meq/g) and low molecular weight markers were from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden. Bio-Gel P-30 was from Bio-Rad Labs., Richmond, USA. Linoleic acid, a-nitroso-b-naphthol, broad range ampholytes (pH, 3±10) gel ®ltration molecular weight marker proteins, ADP, collagen and epinephrine were purchased from Sigma, St. Louis, USA. Phosphatidyl choline (PC) from hen's egg yolk was prepared according to the method of Singleton et al. (1965). Male Swiss Wistar mice (20±22 g) were from Central Animal House, University of Mysore, India. All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and the solvents were redistilled before use. 2.1. CM-Sephadex C-25 column chromatography Echis carinatus venom was fractionated on a CM-Sephadex C-25 column as described previously (Kemparaju et al., 1994). Brie¯y, whole venom (660 mg) in 4 ml 0.02 M phosphate buer pH 7.0 was applied to a column (1.2 Â 110 cm) previously equilibrated with the same buer. The column was eluted stepwise using phosphate buer of various molarities (0.02±0.3 M) and pH 7.0±8.0.

Fractionation was carried out at 208C at a ¯ow rate of 40 ml/h and 5 ml fractions were collected. The protein elution was monitored at 280 nm. The non-retained acidic fraction is now designated as EC-IC-PLA2.

2.2. Electrophoresis EC-IC-PLA2 was subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (0.3 Â 13 Â 15 cm) as described by Davis (1964). A total of 330 mg (each time 30 mg in 1.5 ml saline) was subjected to PAGE using Tris±glycine buer pH 8.3 with a current of 50 mA at 208C for 6 h. After electrophoresis, a portion of the gel (about 2 cm) was sliced longitudinally and stained for proteins with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. The non-stained gel portion was sliced corresponding to the protein bands of the stained gel piece. Proteins from the gel slices were separately electroeluted providing similar conditions for 12 h. Proteins were collected in 3000 cut o dialysis bags. The most acidic protein fraction which moved along with the dye band was called EC-IE-PLA2.

2.3. Bio-Gel P-30 column chromatography EC-IE-PLA2 (12 mg) in 4 ml 0.1 M NaCl containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was thoroughly mixed and kept at 378C for 1 h. It was then loaded onto Bio-Gel P-30 column (1.5 Â 70 cm) which was pre-equilibrated with 0.1 M NaCl. The column was eluted using 0.1 M NaCl with a ¯ow rate of 20 ml/h and 3 ml fractions were collected at 208C. Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer. Individual protein peaks were pooled and dialyzed in saline before use.

2.4. Phospholipase A2 activity The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 1 mmol egg PC, 0.3 ml diethyl ether, 50 mM Tris±HCl buer pH 7.5, 40 mmol Ca2+ and 25 mg enzyme. The free fatty acid released by the action of enzyme on PC was estimated as described by Bhat and Gowda (1989). The speci®c activity was expressed as nmol free fatty acid released/ min/mg protein. For Km determination, 0±2.2 mmol PC was used in the assay mixture. The positional speci®city was determined using autoclaved E. coli cells with the phospholipids labeled at sn-2 position with (14C) oleate as described by Franson et al. (1974).

2.5. Molecular weight determination The molecular weight of puri®ed PLA2 was determined by gel ®ltration on a Sephadex G-50 column (90 Â 1 cm) according to the method of Andrews (1964). Insulin (6000), lysozyme (14,000), soyabean trypsin inhibitor (20,100) and carbonic anhydrase (29,000) were used as standard markers. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 15%) was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (1970). Low molecular weight marker proteins (14±90 kDa) were used. The gel was stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. 2.6. Isoelectric focussing Isoelectric focussing was carried out using Pharmacia 2117 multiphor II electrophoresis system on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel using ampholine with a pH range of 3±10 (Vesterberg, 1972). A portion of the gel was stained for the protein and the remaining portion was cut into 0.5 cm transverse slabs and soaked in 4 ml distilled water for pH determination. 2.7. Fluorescence and protein determination Fluorescence emission of 28 nmol protein in 2 ml saline was recorded after exciting at 280 nm in a Shimadzu RF 5000 spectro¯uorimeter. Protein concentration was determined as described by Lowry et al. (1951). 2.8. Preparation of platelet rich and platelet poor plasma The method of Ardlie and Han (1974) was employed. Human blood was collected from the vein of healthy donors who were non-smokers and had not taken any medication for the previous 15 days. Nine volumes of the blood were collected into 1 volume of acid citrate dextrose (93 mM sodium citrate, 7 mM citric acid and 140 mM glucose pH 6.5). The citrated blood was immediately centrifuged for 10 min at 90 Â g at room temperature. The supernatant was called platelet rich plasma (PRP). The remaining blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 500 Â g and the supernatant obtained was the platelet poor plasma (PPP). The platelet concentration of PRP was adjusted with PPP to 225,000225,000 platelets/ ml. The PRP was kept at 378C and was used within 2 h. All the above preparations were carried out using plasticwares or siliconized glasswares. 2.9. Platelet aggregation The turbidimetric method of Born (1962) was followed using a chronolog dual channel aggregometer connected to a omniscribe dual pen recorder to record the

1663

light transmission as a function of time. Aliquots of PRP (0.45 ml) were preincubated with PLA2 toxin (0±20 mg/0.45 ml PRP) for 2 min in a siliconized cylindrical glass cuvette under constant stirring. The aggregation was initiated by the addition of agonists such as ADP (76 mM), collagen (approximately 2 mg/ml) and epinephrine (22 mM) separately. The aggregation was followed for a period of 4 min. The aggregation trace is the plot of light transmission between PRP and PPP baseline, which represent 0% and 100% aggregation, respectively. Percent inhibition of aggregation was calculated using the value of control (without PLA2 toxin) to be 100%.

2.10. Oedema inducing activity The procedure of Yamakawa et al. (1976), modi®ed by Vishwanath et al. (1987) was followed. Groups of six mice were injected in the right foot pads with dierent doses of PLA2 in 20 ml saline. The left foot pads received 20 ml saline which served as controls. The increase in weight due to oedema was calculated as the oedema ratio by the following equation: Oedema ratio  weight of the oedematous leg Â 100 X weight of normal leg

Minimum oedema dose is the amount of protein required to cause an oedema ratio of 120%.

2.11. Determination of LD50, myotoxicity, cytotoxicity and anticoagulant activity The method of Meier and Theakston (1986) was followed for LD50 determination. Myotoxicity was determined by the method of Gutierrez et al. (1989). EC-I-PLA2 as i.p. dose of 14 mg/kg body weight was injected into a group of six mice. After 2 h blood samples were drawn by retroorbital puncture and lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined in the serum samples using Span diagnostic kit. Cytotoxicity was determined based on trypan blue exclusion using Ehrlich ascites tumor cells grown in the peritoneal cavity of Swiss albino mice according to the method of Chwetzo et al. (1989). Anticoagulant activity was measured by prothrombin times according to the method of Quick (1966).

2.12. Haemolytic activity Direct and indirect haemolytic activity was assayed by the method of Boman and Kaletta (1957). Freshly collected human red blood cells from healthy donors were used for the assays. Activity was expressed as percentage of haemolysis.

3. Results and discussion An acidic PLA2, EC-I-PLA2, has been puri®ed from Indian saw-scaled viper venom. The puri®cation was achieved using CM-Sephadex C-25 column chromatography, PAGE followed by gel ®ltration on a Bio-Gel P-30 column (Fig. 1). PAGE pattern of EC-IC-PLA2 recovered from CM-Sephadex C-25 column is shown in Fig. 2A. After electroelution, about 90% of the protein and 125% of the phospholipase activity were recovered from the gel slices (data not shown). The fast moving protein band, EC-IE-PLA2, contributed for about 4% of the protein and 31% of the phospholipase activity loaded onto PAGE. EC-IE-PLA2, although it gives a single band in PAGE (Fig. 2B), showed 2 bands in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). EC-IE-PLA2, when subjected to gel ®ltration on a Bio-Gel P-30 column, and in the presence of 8 M urea or 7 M guanidinium hydrochloride eluted as a single peak (not shown). However, in the presence of 2% SDS upon gel ®ltration, EC-IE-PLA2 was resolved into three peaks (Fig.1). This suggested that EC-IE-PLA2 is an association of three proteins with dierent molecular weight. The ®rst and last peak did not show phospholipase activity, but contributed for about 4% and <1% of the protein loaded on to the column, respectively. The middle major peak designated as EC-I-PLA2 showed phospholipase activity. About 89% of the protein and 132% of the activity loaded on to the column were recovered in this peak. A summary of the puri®cation of EC-I-PLA2 is given in Table 1. The proteins corresponding to the ®rst and second peak resolved in gel ®ltration are also seen in the SDS-PAGE pattern of EC-IE-

PLA2, but the protein of the third peak was not noticed in the SDS-PAGE pattern of EC-IE-PLA2. This could possibly be due to its occurrence in trace amount (<1%). EC-I-PLA2 was homogeneous as it showed a single band in PAGE (Fig.2C), SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3C) and isoelectro focussing (not shown). The estimated molecular weight was 16,000 determined by SDS-PAGE and 15,800 by gel ®ltration on a Sephadex G-50 column. The molecular weight agrees with the range generally reported for monomeric snake venom PLA2 (Desmond et al., 1991; Kemparaju et al., 1994). The isoelectric point (pI ) was estimated to be between 4.2 and 4.8. This agrees with the pI values reported for two acidic PLA2 (pI 4.6) of Kenyan E. carinatus leakeyi venom (Desmond et al., 1991). EC-I-PLA2 exhibited a ¯uorescence emission maximum at 348 nm when excited at 280 nm, suggesting the exposed tryptophan residues in the molecule. EC-I-PLA2 released radiolabeled fatty acid from E. coli cells containing phospholipids speci®cally labeled at the sn-2 position with (14C) oleate. EC-IPLA2 showing a speci®c activity of 544 nmol/min/mg. Km determination by double reciprocal plot (Lineweaver and Burk, 1934) was found to be 1.66 mM. The speci®c activity and Km values of EC-I-PLA2 are greater than the values reported for EC-IV-PLA2 (400 nmol/min/mg and 0.25 mM respectively) which is a basic PLA2 isolated from the same venom (Kemparaju et al., 1994). This

suggested that EC-I-PLA2 appears to have less anity towards the substrate PC when compared with EC-IV-PLA2. The pH and temperature optima (pH 7.5 and 378C, respectively) are comparable with the values reported for most of the venom PLA2. EC-I-PLA2 exhibited indirect haemolytic activity as it converts lecithin into lysolecithin which in turn lyses the erythrocyte membrane. About 38% haemolysis was observed when 25 mg enzyme was incubated for 10 min in the reaction mixture. EC-I-PLA2 did not show direct haemolytic activity, possibly due to the inability of the enzyme to hydrolyze inner membrane phospholipids of erythrocytes (Rosenberg, 1986). EC-I-PLA2 was not lethal to experimental mice up to an i.p. dose of 14 mg/kg body weight. In contrast, the basic PLA2 isolated from the same venom (Kemparaju et al., 1994) was toxic with an i.p. LD50 value of 5 mg/kg body weight. Although this result supports the view that acidic PLA2 is less toxic and enzymatically more active than basic PLA2 (Rosenberg, 1986), lethal potencies of venom PLA2 can neither be correlated to its catalytic property nor to its isoelectric point (Dhillon et al., 1987). For instance, an acidic PLA2 from N. naja sputatrix venom (Tan and Arunmozhiarasi, 1989) possess an i.v. LD50 value of 0.86 mg/kg/body weight in mice, and enzyme activity of 2130 mmol/ min/mg. EC-I-PLA2 induced non-haemorrhagic oedema in the foot pads of mice

The minimum oedema dose (2.25 mg) agrees with the values reported for the acidic PLA2 TFV PL-Ia (2.2 mg) and TFV PL-Ib (3 mg) of T. ¯avoviridis venom (Vishwanath et al., 1987) and NN-I2c-PLA2 (2.5 mg) and NN-I2e-PLA2 (2.7 mg) of N. naja naja venom (Rudrammaji and Gowda, 1998). EC-I-PLA2 inhibited human platelet aggregation when induced separately by ADP, collagen and epinephrine. The inhibition was both concentration (Fig. 4) and time (Fig. 5) dependent in all the cases studied. The inhibition was pronounced with epinephrine and collagen when compared with ADP. At a concentration of 20 mg EC-I-PLA2, the percent inhibition was 8225, 7227 and 33 2 2 (values are mean 2 S.D.; n=3), respectively, for epinephrine, collagen and ADP induced aggregation. The calculated IC50 values ware 12.8 and 13.8 mg for collagen and epinephrine induced aggregation, respectively. For ADP induced aggregation the IC50 value could not be calculated as there was only 33% inhibition observed when 20 mg EC-I-PLA2 was used in the reaction mixture. The platelet aggregation inhibition was not tested beyond 20 mg EC-I-PLA2 in all the cases. Fig. 6 shows the typical aggregation pattern when stimulated by collagen. Our results agree well with the aggregation properties of two acidic PLA2 isolated from T. gramineus (Ouyang and Huang, 1983) and A. halys (Ouyang et al., 1983) venoms, which inhibited thrombin, ADP, collagen, and sodium arachidonate induced rabbit platelet aggregation. Three acidic PLA2 of N. naja naja venom also inhibited ADP, collagen and epinephrine induced human platelet aggregation (Rudrammaji, personal communication). However, EC-I-PLA2 diers from the aggregation properties of an acidic PLA2 of A. acutus venom (Chen and Chen,

1989) which showed biphasic eects on human platelet aggregation. Several PLA2 interfering in platelet function have been isolated and studied from snake venoms (Kini and Evans, 1990, and references therein). PLA2 which aect platelet aggregation includes two classes (Kini and Evans, 1989). Class A enzymes exhibit biphasic eects, where, under certain conditions, they both inhibit and initiate aggregation, whereas class B PLA2 only inhibit platelet aggregation. Thus EC-IPLA2 belongs to the latter class. EC-I-PLA2 is devoid of myotoxicity, anticoagulant activity and cytotoxicity (on EAT cells). Thus, in conclusion, EC-I-PLA2, being a non-lethal PLA2, appears to play a role in the digestion of the prey. However, synergism with other components of the venom cannot be ruled out in inducing toxic eects. References
