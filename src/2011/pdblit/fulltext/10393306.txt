Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanothermus fervidus
The homotetrameric holo-d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanothermus fervidus has been crystallized in the presence of NADP+ using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Crystals grew from a solution containing 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and magnesium acetate. A Ê native data set has been collected to 2.1 A using synchrotron radiation and cryocooling. Diffraction data have been processed in the orthorhombic system (space group P21212) with unit-cell Ê dimensions a = 136.7, b = 153.3, c = 74.9 A and one tetramer per asymmetric unit.

1. Introduction
The phosphorylating d-glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the reversible oxidation of d-glyceraldehyde-3phosphate to 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD(P)+ as an obligatory cofactor (Harris & Waters, 1976). GAPDH enzymes (E.C. 1.2.1.12) extracted from eubacterial and eukaryotic sources are usually NAD+-dependent, while archaeal GAPDHs exhibit dual cofactor speci®city with a marked preference for NADP+ (Fabry & Hensel, 1987; Jones et al., 1995; Zwickl et al., 1990). With the exception of the chloroplastic enzymes, all phosphorylating GAPDHs known so far contain four identical subunits with a monomeric Mr of $36 kDa. Primary structure alignments (Fabry et al., 1989; Zwickl et al., 1990; Arcari et al., 1993; Talfournier et al., 1998) reveal signi®cant levels of identity between archaeal GAPDHs, but more speculative amino-acid sequence comparisons including eukaryotic and eubacterial GAPDHs (Fabry & Hensel, 1988; Fabry et al., 1989) do not provide evidence for a unique three-dimensional fold common to all GAPDHs. Crystal structures have been solved for GAPDH enzymes isolated from a number of eukaryotic and eubacterial species including american lobster (Moras et al., 1975), chinese lobster (Song et al., 1998), man (Watson et al., 1972), parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei (Vellieux et al., 1993) and Leishmania mexicana (Kim et al., 1995), eubacteria such as Â mesophilic Escherichia coli (Duee et al., 1996) and Bacillus coagulans (Grif®th et al., 1983), moderately thermophilic B. stearothermophilus (Skarzynski et al., 1987), thermophilic Thermus aquaticus (Tanner et al., 1996) and hyperthermophilic Thermotoga

È maritima (Korndorfer et al., 1995). Crystallization and preliminary X-ray results have recently been described for GAPDH from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (Fleming et al., 1998). The archaeon Methanothermus fervidus lives in extreme conditions and grows optimally at 358 K. Thus, the determination of the threedimensional structure of GAPDH isolated from this hyperthermophilic microorganism will constitute a signi®cant contribution to the knowledge of the structural determinants responsible for molecular and cellular thermostability.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Puri®cation

The wild-type recombinant GAPDH from M. fervidus was genetically overexpressed in E. coli HB101 cells and puri®ed to homogeneity by the procedure described by Talfournier et al. (1998). Protein solutions (10 mg mlÀ1) were prepared in 10 mM Tris±HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 2 mM EDTA.

2.2. Crystallization

# 1999 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Denmark ± all rights reserved

Screening for optimal crystallization conditions was performed using the hanging-drop method of vapour diffusion and the sparsematrix factorial search of Jancarik & Kim (1991). Screening was carried out at three different temperatures, namely 277, 285 and 293 K. For each experiment, 4 ml of the GAPDH solution was mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution.

2.3. Diffraction measurements

X-ray diffraction intensity data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at Grenoble (France). Prior to data collection, a suitable native crystal was soaked in a cryobuffer identical to the mother liquor but with the 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol concentration

increased to 20%. The crystal was then ¯ashcooled in a nitrogen-gas stream at 100 K before mounting. The wavelength of the Ê incident radiation was 0.987 A and the crystal-to-detector distance was 245 mm. The diffraction spots were recorded on a Princeton CCD camera (1242 Â 1152 pixels) with a 0.5 oscillation for each CCD image; a total range of 135 was covered. Data were processed using the MARXDS package (Klein, 1993; Kabsch, 1993). A second set of X-ray data was collected in our laboratory at 100 K on a DIP2030 Enraf±Nonius area detector using a rotating-anode generator. The wavelength Ê of the incident radiation was 1.542 A and the crystal-to-detector distance was 200 mm. A total range of 110 was covered, with 1.0 oscillation per image. Data were processed using DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996).

magnesium acetate, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 60 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5) at 285 K. A total of 415 252 re¯ections in the resoÊ lution range 35±2.1 A were collected at the synchrotron beamline. They were reduced to 82 965 unique re¯ections. Overall, the data 5.6% on intensities set had  Rsym of  an (Rsym = jI À hIija I) and was 91.7% complete (Table 1). We observed a low completeness at low resolution [67.9% in the Ê resolution range 15.0±8.0 A; I/'(I) = 15.5, Rsym = 4.0%] which was because of overloading. Autoindexing routines gave solutions consistent with an orthorhombic space group, which enabled unit-cell dimensions to Ê be re®ned to a = 136.7, b = 153.3, c = 74.9 A. Systematic extinctions [I/'(I) < 3] of h00 (with h = 2n + 1) and 0k0 (with k = 2n + 1) re¯ections were observed, corresponding to the P21212 space group. Both crystallization conditions and space group are different from those previously described by Fabry et al. (1988), who obtained crystals belonging to the tetragonal space group P4122. As biochemical data have reliably demonstrated that the M. fervidus GAPDH is composed of four identical subunits of 337 residues (Fabry & Hensel, 1987; Talfournier et al., 1998), comparison of the unit-cell volume with that of holoenzyme crystals from B. stearothermophilus (Skarzynski et al., 1987) suggested the presence of one tetramer of M. fervidus GAPDH per asymmetric unit. In good agreement with values known for other proteins (Matthews, 1968), the predicted packing density value Vm Ê would then be 2.6 A3 DaÀ1 and the probable solvent content would be 47.3%. On the basis of the molecular 222 symmetry systematically observed in all presently known three-dimensional structures of tetrameric GAPDHs, a self-rotation function was calculated using the GLRF program (Tong & Rossmann, 1990) in order to obtain the orientations of the three putative twofold non-crystallographic axes of the M. fervidus tetramer in the asymmetric unit. A stereographic projection (Fig. 2) revealed two peaks at È = 34, É = 90 and È = 56, É = 90 which corresponded to two non-crystallographic twofold axes. Assuming a 222 symmetry, the third molecular twofold axis then would lie parallel to crystallographic c axis. Indeed, a native Patterson map (w = 0 section) indicated a high-intensity peak characteristic of a non-crystallographic twofold axis and a crystallographic twofold axis parallel to each other (Fig. 3). The location of this peak revealed the fractional

coordinates of the molecular axis relative to the crystal axis c: x = 0.225 and y = 0.250. The recently solved three-dimensional structure of S. solfataricus GAPDH (Fleming et al., 1998; J. A. Littlechild, personal communication), which shows 49% identity with the M. fervidus GAPDH, was tested as a model which was probably well adapted for molecular-replacement calculations; previous attempts using the native structures of eubacterial GAPDHs as models failed to converge toward a plausible three-dimensional structure for M. fervidus GAPDH. The tetramer of S. solfataricus GAPDH was used as a model for molecular-replacement studies in the resolution range 10.0± Ê 4.0 A using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1987, 1994). To provide a suf®cient amount of data at low resolution, the ESRF data were merged with the `in-house' data with an Rmerge of 8.9% in the resolution range 10± Ê 4 A using the program BLANC (Vagin et al., 1998). The rotation function calculated with Ê a 23 A integration radius had four peaks with height of 16 r.m.s. When the model was

rotated using any of these solutions, one of its molecular dyads `In-house' data appeared to be parallel 2.5 to the crystallographic 4.6 twofold axis c, in agree93.6 18.0 ment with the self-rota3.1 tion function and the Ê 13.9 (2.50±2.59 A) native Patterson map 74.6 4.9 results. Subsequently, the orientation corresponding to the ®rst peak was used in the calculation of the translation function and gave two major peaks. One of them gave a correlation C =   jFo j À hjFo ji jFc jÀ hjFc ji /  jFo j À  ji hjFo ji2 jFc jÀ hjFc 2 1a2 of 51.1% and an    R factor R = jFo À jFc ja jFo j of 50.1%, while the next solution exhibited a correlation of 49.8% and an R factor of 50.8%. The third peak had a correlation of only 36.4%. However, neither of the two ®rst solutions could be re®ned further, possibly owing to the relative movement of subunits within the tetramer. Thereafter, each subunit was tentatively taken as an independent rigid body and a re®nement using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) in Ê the resolution range 10±4 A was then performed in order to optimize the rotational and translational parameters corresponding to the ®rst solution. The R factor fell to 47.0%. Re®nement then took place using the Ê ESRF data in the resolution range 10±2.1 A without NCS restraints using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). 2% of the data were selected for Rfree calculations. The model, which has now been re®ned to a ®nal R factor of 19.4% and Rfree of 25.7%, clearly appears to be of the holo type (one NADP+ molecule per monomer) and will be described in detail elsewhere. Structural analysis is now in progress with the aim of comparing the now available S. solfataricus (J. A. Littlechild, personal communication) and M. fervidus archaeal GAPDH crystal structures and of providing new insights into the rational description of the molecular phenomena responsible for extreme thermostability. Comments and proposals from both reviewers were deeply appreciated.
