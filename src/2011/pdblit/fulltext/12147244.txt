Abstract Extracellular cellulolytic enzymes were produced under solid state cultivation by the thermophilic fungus Thermoascus aurantiacus and characterized. Elevated levels of endoglucanase and b-glucosidase activities were produced simultaneously by optimization of growth factors. Under optimal growth conditions, 1572 U endoglucanase and 101.6 U b-glucosidase per g of carbon source were obtained. Chromogenic (fluorogenic) 4-methylumbelliferyl-b-glycosides of glucose (MUG) and cellobiose (MUG2) were used to characterize the cellulolytic multienzyme components after separation by isoelectric focusing. The zymogram indicated one endoglucanase and one b-glucosidase with pI values 3.5 and 3.9, respectively. Both enzymes exhibited significant thermostability, with half-lives of 42 and 18 min, respectively, at 80 8C. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Cellulose, present in the renewable lignocellulosics, is considered the most important reservoir of carbon for the production of glucose, a fuel and chemical feedstock. Enzymic hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose offers several advantages over acid hydrolysis [1,2]. The majority of commercial cellulases are extracellular enzymes produced by mesophilic microorganisms. Since the use of cellulose degrading enzymes is related to industrial processes operating at high temperatures, application of thermostable enzymes produced by thermophilic microorganisms appears to be advantageous [3].

Thermophilic fungi produce hydrolases characterized by valuable properties such as superior thermostability, optimum activity at elevated temperatures and high rates of substrate hydrolysis [4,5]. Among thermophilic fungi, Thermoascus aurantiacus has been reported to produce cellulolytic [3,6] and xylanolytic enzyme activities [7 /9] in both submerged and solid state cultivation (SSC). The latter method of growth is a promising alternative for inexpensive cellulase production [10,11]. Various agricultural substrates-byproducts and microbial cultures have been used successfully in solid state fermentation for cellulase production [12 /14]. Considering these facts, experiments were carried out in SSC to optimize growth of T. aurantiacus on low-cost and easily available carbon sources for the production of high levels of cellulolytic activities and characterization of their multienzyme complex.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Microorganism T. aurantiacus Miehe, IMI 216529, (kindly provided by Dr M.K. Bhat, IFR, Reading Lab., UK), was used in the present work. The stock culture was maintained on potato-dextrose agar at 4 8C. 2.2. Media and growth conditions SSC was carried out in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 2.5 g of dry carbon source mixed with 10 ml of the mineral solution (gram per litre distilled water: (NH4)2SO4 3.5, KH2PO4 3, Mg2SO4 7H2O 0.5, CaCl2 0.5). The carbon sources (wheat straw, rice straw, corn cobs, wheat bran, oat bran, Arundo donax and Populus tremuloides ) were kindly supplied by the Agricultural University of Athens. They were prepared as described elsewhere [8] and supplemented the mineral solution prior to heat sterilization (121 8C, 20 min). The growth medium was inoculated as described [8] and incubation was carried out at 49 8C under static conditions. Experiments were carried out in duplicate. A step by step optimization procedure regarding the effect of type of carbon and nitrogen source, concentration of the latter source, growth temperature, and initial growth pH was employed. The optimum conditions found for the examined parameter were used in the subsequent studies. Ammonium sulphate, potassium nitrate, ammonium hydrogen phosphate, yeast extract, urea, peptone (Merck, Germany) and corn steep liquor (Sigma, USA) were the nitrogen sources tested in this study. The elemental concentration was calculated so as to provide 0.04 g nitrogen per g of carbon source. When the effect of the pH on enzyme production was studied, the distilled water of the medium was replaced by 0.1 M citrate /phosphate buffer, at the appropriate pH. 2.3. Enzyme extraction Enzymes were extracted from the SSC broth on a daily basis (until the eighth day of incubation) with 10fold (v/w) distilled water by shaking (150 rev/min) at 50 8C for 60 min. The solids materials and fungal biomass were separated by centrifugation (10 000)/g, 15 min) and the clarified supernatant used for enzyme assays. 2.4. Enzyme assay One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to liberate 1 mmol of product per minute. The assay was carried out in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5, at 50 8C for 10 min.

Product concentration was determined using a standard curve. Endoglucanase was assayed using 4% (w/v) carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC) (low viscosity, Sigma). The release of reducing sugars was determined using the 3,5dinitrosalicylic acid method [15]. b-Glucosidase activity was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 420 nm, following 10 min incubation of enzyme with 1 mM p -nitrophenyl-b-D-glucopyranoside. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30% (w/v) sodium carbonate solution [16]. During isoelectric focusing (IEF) on Ampholite 3.0 / 9.5 polyacrylamide gel (Pharmacia, Sweden), enzyme activities were assayed by flooding the gels with appropriate solutions of 4-methylumbelliferyl-glycoside and UV-transillumination as described elsewhere [17].

2.5. Crude enzyme production Crude cellulolytic enzymes from T. aurantiacus were produced under SSC using untreated wheat straw at 50 8C. The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 4 using 0.1 M citrate /phosphate buffer. The (NH4)2SO4 concentration in the mineral solution was 1% (w/v) and the final moisture content was 80% (w/v). On day 7 of growth, the crude enzyme was extracted as previously described.

2.6. Isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis IEF-PAGE was carried out using a PhastSystem electrophoresis unit (Pharmacia) and a 10/15% polyacrylamide gel containing ampholytes covering the pH range 3.0 /9.5.

2.7. Determination of enzyme pH and temperature optima, pH-stability and thermostability The optimum temperature was determined by assaying the enzyme activity at various temperatures (50 / 90 8C) for 10 min in 0.1 M citrate /phosphate buffer, pH 5.0. The optimum pH was determined by measuring the activity at 50 8C over the pH range of 3.0 /11.0 using the following buffers: 0.1 M citrate-phosphate (pH 3.0 /7.0), 0.1 M Tris /HCl (pH 7.0 /9.0) and 0.1 M glycine /NaOH (pH 9.0 /11.0). The pH-stability of the enzymes was determined by incubation in the buffers described above for 24 h and measuring the residual activity, at 50 8C. Thermostability was determined by measuring residual activity, after incubation of the enzyme at 80 8C and pH 5.0 in the absence of substrate, for different periods of time.

2.8. Effect of D-glucose and cellobiose The effect of D-glucose and cellobiose on the hydrolysis of CMC was measured by the capacity of the enzyme to decrease the viscosity of CMC [18] in the presence of different concentrations of these sugars. 2.9. Enzymic saccharification of cellulose A 50-ml reaction mixture, containing 44 ml of 0.1 M citrate /phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, 1 ml 1% (w/v) NaN3, 7.5 g cellulose and 5 ml enzyme (equivalent to 450 Units of endoglucanase activity) was incubated at 60 8C for 48 h in a reciprocal shaker operating at 200 rpm. Samples (0.5 /1.0 ml) were withdrawn hourly for the first 10 h, as well as after 26 and 50 h of incubation. Samples were centrifuged at 10 000)/g for 15 min and the supernatants were assayed for total reducing sugars (TRS) [15] and glucose (Gluco-test, Biosis, Athens).

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of carbon source Untreated wheat straw was the most effective carbon source for endoglucanase and b-glucosidase production (1235 and 105 U/g carbon source, respectively) among the lignocellulosic materials tested as sources (Table 1). Arundo cane, wheat bran, oat bran and rice straw resulted in lower endoglucanase (150 /600 U/g), and bglucosidase activities (10 /50 U/g). The other carbon sources resulted in significantly lower activities (endoglucanase B/100 U/g, b-glucosidase B/1 U/g). The use of wheat straw in SSC for cellulase production, especially in combination with wheat bran, has been well documented [12,14,19]. However, since the cellulolytic activities observed during T. aurantiacus growth on wheat straw were much higher than those observed on the other substrates, wheat straw was used as the only carbon source in subsequent experiments. 3.2. Effect of nitrogen source When different nitrogen sources were tested, the results (Table 1) showed that enzyme activities were higher with inorganic nitrogen. These data are in contrast to those reported in the literature, where high hydrolytic activities were observed when T. aurantiacus was grown on organic nitrogen sources [6,20,21]. Ammonium sulphate, the least expensive nitrogen source, gave the best activities. The optimum ammonium sulphate concentration was 1% w/v and it was used in subsequent experiments.

Wheat straw was used as carbon source.

3.3. Effect of growth temperature In order to examine the effect of temperature on cellulase production, growth temperatures in the range of 45 /53 8C were tested. Maximum endoglucanase and b-glucosidase activities were obtained when the fungus was grown at 50 8C (Fig. 1). Similar results have been reported for T. aurantiacus growth under SSC [22].

3.5. Comparison of enzyme activity Cellulase production by mesophilic and thermophilic fungi, under SSC has been reported by various workers (Table 2). Comparison between cellulase activities is not always possible because no standard enzyme assay conditions (including substrate) have yet been adopted. Under the optimum conditions found during this study, simultaneous production of high levels of endoglucanase and b-glucosidase activities was obtained. The activities produced by the thermophilic fungus T. aurantiacus , compared favourably with those reported in the literature for other microorganisms. 3.6. Enzyme characteristics
Fig. 2. Effect of initial culture pH on endoglucanase and b-glucosidase production by T. aurantiacus (carbon source:wheat straw, nitrogen source:(NH4)2SO4 1%, growth temperature: 50 8C).

3.4. Effect of initial growth pH The optimum pH for cellulase production was found to be 4 (Fig. 2), resulting in high endoglucanase (1572 U/ g wheat straw) and b-glucosidase (101.6 U/g wheat straw) activities. Above pH 5, the fungus did not grow well, and as a consequence low enzyme yields were observed. These results are in agreement with those reported in the literature, confirming that filamentous fungi prefer acidic environments with optima at pH 3.8 / 5 [23]. It should be noted that the optimum pHs cited in the literature for SSC were, in most cases, initial pHs, since growth pH could fluctuate considerably, depending on the nitrogen source and cultivation time [10].

b-Glucosidase was optimally active at pH 4.5 while endoglucanase exhibited its maximum activity at pH 3.5 and 4. The optimal temperature of b-glucosidase and endoglucanase activity was 80 and 75 8C, respectively. Incubation of T. aurantiacus cellulase for 24 h in buffer solutions with pH values between 3 and 11 showed that the entire enzyme activity was retained at pH values 5/ 8. Thermostability of enzymes was determined by measuring residual activity, after incubation at 80 8C and pH5. Endoglucanase and b-glucosidase exhibited halflives of 42 and 18 min, respectively. At 70 8C the halflives of the same enzymes were 2.5 days and 1 day, respectively. As described previously [17], component activities of cellulolytic systems, separated by IEF, can be differentiated using 4-methylumbelliferyl-b-glycosides. b-Glucosidase and endoglucanase were detected in the present work using 4-methylumbelliferyl-b-glycosides derived

4. Conclusions The thermophilic fungus T. aurantiacus , grown on a simple medium consisting of agricultural by-products and a low cost mineral source in SSC, proved to be a promising microorganism for simultaneous endoglucanase and b-glucosidase production. The high thermostability of the enzymes could be advantageous in certain industrial applications. The enzymes secreted by the fungus were able to hydrolyze cellulose extensively producing significant amounts of glucose. These findings make T. aurantiacus growth in SSC worthy of further investigation in larger scale operations.

from glucose (MUG) and cellobiose (MUG2), respectively (Fig. 3). The endoglucanase active fractions of T. aurantiacus were characterized here as acidic proteins (pH3.5) whereas the crude enzyme preparation showed, also, a single b-glucosidase active fraction focusing at pH3.9. The relative reduction of viscosity during CMC hydrolysis in the presence of D-glucose was retained above 70%, even at 1.5 M concentration, whereas 100 mM cellobiose inhibited hydrolysis by 50% (Fig. 4). The non-inhibitory effect of glucose is very important because it comprised more than 70% of the soluble sugars released from cellulose by the crude enzyme (Fig. 5). The enzyme hydrolyzed cellulose by 29% in 48 h and resulted in 3.0% (w/v) glucose and 4.3% (w/v) TRS concentration.
