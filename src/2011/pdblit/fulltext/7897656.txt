I. Introduction

The [2Fe-2S]-containing protein, ferredoxin, functions as the central molecule for distributing electrons originating from the oxidation of water during oxygenic photosynthesis to a number of ferredoxin-dependent enzymes in the chloroplasts of higher plants and algae and also in cyanobacteria. This review will begin with a brief summary of the current state of our knowledge of the essential properties of higher plant, algal and cyanobacterial ferredoxins. As a full understanding of the role of ferredoxin in oxygenic photosynthesis not only requires an outline of how reduced ferredoxin is utilized, but also requires a description of how reduced ferredoxin is made available, the second section of the review will summarize what is known of the mechanism by which the Photosystem I reaction center reduces ferredoxin. With this information in hand, a description of four of the best-characterized chloroplast ferredoxin-dependent enzymes (ferredoxin : NADP + oxidoreductase; ferredoxin : nitrite oxidoreductase; glutamate synthase and ferredoxin: thioredoxin reductase) will be presented. Emphasis will be placed on the electrostatic interaction of these enzymes with ferredoxin.
11. Ferredoxin

Fig, 1. The [2Fe-2S] cluster of S. platensis ferredoxin. The two irons of the cluster are designated Fel and Fe2. Two sulfurs are inorganic sulfide and the other sulfurs coordinated to iron arise from cysteines 40, 45, 48 and 77. From Ref. 20a.

Ferredoxins are widely distributed in biological systems, being found in microorganisms, plants and animals [1]. Although the name ferredoxin was first applied to a bacterial iron-sulfur protein [2], by 1962 it had become clear that proteins isolated from higher plants and known by a variety of names [3-8] were related to the bacterial protein through the presence of similar ironsulfur prosthetic groups. Thereafter, the name ferredoxin began to be applied to both bacterial and plant proteins. The functional relationship of the plant and bacterial ferredoxins became clear when it was demonstrated that a bacterial ferredoxin could replace the plant protein as an electron carrier in NADP ÷ photoreduction catalyzed by chloroplast membranes [8], even though it was established later that the bacterial ferredoxin contained a [4Fe-4S] prosthetic group rather than the [2Fe-2S] cluster found in chloroplast ferredoxins [1,9]. The discussion in this section will be limited to a treatment of the chemistry of 'plant-type' ferredoxins, but readers interested in the chemistry of 'bactetial-type' ferredoxins should consult Refs. 10-13. Ferredoxins found in the chloroplasts of higher plants and algae and in cyanobacteria are monomeric proteins with molecular masses of approx. 12 kDa [14-18]. The proteins contain, per molecule of protein, two non-heme irons and two inorganic (acid labile) sulfides arranged in a single cluster. Each of the irons is tetracoordinate, with the two inorganic sulfides bridging the irons and four cysteinyl sulfurs, two per iron, also serving as

ligands [1,9]. Although there are no X-ray crystal structures available for any higher plant or algal ferredoxins, the three-dimensional structure of the homologous ferredoxin from the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis is known [19,20]. The structure of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of S. platensis ferredoxin, shown in Fig. 1, is likely to be very similar to those of plant and algal ferredoxins, as all these ferredoxins have very similar optical, circular dichroic and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra [1,9]. Ferredoxins serve as low-potential, one-electron cartiers with E m values ranging from -310 to -455 mV [9,21,22]. Oxidized forms of [2Fe-2S]-containing ferredoxins exhibit no EPR spectrum because the presence of two anti-ferromagneticaUy coupled, high-spin (S = 5/2) ferric irons gives the cluster a net spin state of S = 0 [14,22]. The reduced proteins exhibit characteristic EPR spectra (values of 2.03, 1.94 and 1.86 are typical for gz, gy and gx) due to the net S = 1/2 spin state of the cluster that arises from the addition of one electron to the S = 0 oxidized cluster [22]. EPR spectra of reduced parsley ferredoxin in which the naturally occurring isotopes of iron and inorganic sulfide were replaced by isotopes that have a nuclear magnetic moment indicate that the single electron taken up on reduction is substantially delocalized over the entire cluster [23]. Amino acid sequences are available for more than 40 [2Fe-2S]-containing, higher plant ferredoxins [24]. These proteins contain from 93 to 99 amino acids in a single

95 polypeptide chain, with alanine being present at the amino terminus in almost all cases. Sequences are also available for more than 20 [2Fe-2S]-containing, cyanobacterial ferredoxins [25] and for several [2Fe-2S]-containing ferredoxins from red algae [26]. There is a conservation of the spacing between the four cysteines that serve as ligands to the duster irons. (The four cysteines that serve as cluster ligands are located at residues 39,44,47 and 77 in the spinach ferredoxin sequence - Ref. 24.) The region in the vicinity of the [2Fe-2S] cluster is the most highly conserved portion of ferredoxin, with regions of the protein remote from the cluster showing considerably more variability (Table I, Refs. 24, 27, 28). Ferredoxins isolated from plants, algae and cyanobacteria are, in general, highly acidic proteins. As can be seen from Table I, several of the acidic amino acids found in ferredoxins occur at highly conserved positions. The possible rote of these conserved acidic residues in the interaction of ferredoxin with ferredoxin-dependent enzymes will be discussed below. The tertiary structure of ferredoxin from the cyanobacterium S. platensis is known to 0.25 nm resolution [19,20]. Because of the amino acid sequence homology of this cyanobacterial ferredoxin with plant and algal ferredoxins [24], it is likely that the tertiary structures of other ferredoxins will show considerable similarities to that of S. platensis. Fig. 2 illustrates the overall tertiary structure of the cyanobacterial ferredoxin. A detailed view of the network of hydrogen bonds to amino acids that serve as ligands to the iron-sulfur cluster is presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows the location of the acidic amino acid groups of spinach ferredoxin on a model in which the spinach ferredoxin amino acid sequence has been juxtaposed on the S. platensis ferredoxin structure [291. In higher plants and algae the gene coding for ferredoxin is a nuclear gene [30] and ferredoxin is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes in the form of a precursor protein with an amino-terminal sequence that is required for targeting the precursor for import across

The insertion of the [2Fe-2S] cluster into the apoprotein in vivo probably occurs via an enzyme-catalyzed reaction that takes place in the chloroplast stroma [32]. However, in vitro studies indicate t h a t the cluster can spontaneously assemble if the apoprotein, ferrous iron and inorganic sulfide are present under reducing conditions [9].

IlL Ferredoxin reduction by Photosystem I
III-A. Photosystern I function and primary reactions
The reduction of ferredoxin in chloroplasts is accomplished by the Photosystem I reaction center, which catalyzes the transfer of one electron from the cuprous form of the copper-containing protein plastocyanin to ferredoxin [33]. Although one does not usually think of the Photosystem I reaction center as a ferredoxin-dependent enzyme, this multi-subunit, integral m e m b r a n e complex does function to catalyze electron flow to ferredoxin, albeit in a fashion that requires photons as an additional substrate. (The quantum yield for the Photosystem I-mediated reduction of ferredoxin is one electron transferred per absorbed photon. Ref. 34.) In Euglena, some cyanobacteria, and some algae under conditions of copper depletion, a soluble c-type cytochrome substitutes for plastocyanin as the electron donor for ferredoxin photoreduction [35,36]. The initial charge separation reaction of the Photosystem I reaction center involves the photooxidation of P700 (probably a dimer of chlorophyll a) and the reduction of the primary acceptor, A 0 (probably a chlorophyll a monomer), with a characteristic time of approx. 10 ps [37-43]. The electron is subsequently transfered from reduced A 0 to the secondary electron acceptor, A 1, in a time ranging from 40 to 200 ps depending on the preparation used [37,38,40,41]. The chemical identity of A1 is still a matter of some controversy [37,44]. Considerable evidence, including resuits obtained from resolution and reconstitution experiments, has been gathered supporting the identification of A 1 as one of the two phylloquinone (vitamin K - l ) molecules found in the Photosystem I reaction centers of plants and cyanobacteria [37,43,45-57]. Reduced-rninus-oxJdized optical difference spectra of A~ are consistent with A~ being a phylloquinone [45,46], as are E P R spectra of photoreduced A 1 [43,47-49,57]. However, some experiments in which phylloquinone is destroyed by ultraviolet irradiation showed little effect on the primary photochemistry of Photosystem I, suggesting that phyUoquinone is neither A t nor an obligate electron carrier in Photosystem I [58,59]. One possible explanation for this disagreement concerning the role of phylloquinone m a y be that electron transfer through Photosystem I occurs via different pathways at physio-

97 logical temperatures and at the cryogenic temperatures often used to study the early events of Photosystem I [59a]. Clearly, additional research will be necessary if the chemical identity of A1 and the role of phylloquinone in the early electron transfer events of Photosystem I are to be established in an unambiguous manner. Analyses of EPR signals [70] support the conclusion based on non-heme iron and acid-labile sulfide content [67,68] that F x is present in the Photosystem I reaction center in amounts equimolar to P700. F x is present, along with acceptors A 0 and A 1, in Photosystem I core protein preparations that contain only two peptides [64,67], one copy each [71-75] of the products of the psaA and psaB genes [76-83]. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, both the psaA and psaB genes are located on chloroplast D N A [76-81]. The two largest, homologous subunits of the Photosystem I reaction center, the psaA and psaB proteins, thus constitute a heterodimer that contains P700 and the three earliest electron acceptors associated with Photosystem I. The demonstration that F x is a [4Fe-4S] duster requires that the heterodimer peptides provide 4 cysteine residues to act as ligands to the cluster irons [9]. An examination of amino acid sequences for these two large subunits of the Photosystern I reaction center, deduced from the gene sequences [76-83], indicates that higher plant psaB proteins contain only two cysteines and higher plant psaA proteins contain four cysteines, only two of which are highly conserved. These two highly conserved psaA cysteines are found in a completely conserved, 12 amino acid long portion of the protein that is not only identical in all eight known psaA sequences, but is also identical to the sequence found in psaB that contains the two cysteines found in this protein [68]. It thus has been

III-B. Iron-sulfur center X
The time for electron transfer from reduced A 1 to the next electron acceptor of the Photosystem I reaction center has been estimated to be in the range from 15 to 200 ns [46,60]. There is now agreement that the component that functions as the electron acceptor after A 1 in Photosystem I is a [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur duster, referred to as Center X or Fx [33,37,61-70]. F x was originally identified by the EPR spectrum of the reduced cluster (g values of 2.08, 1.88 and 1.78 are usually observed Ref. 61, 62) and more recently obtained reduced-minusoxidized optical difference spectra are also consistent with the identification of Fx as an iron-sulfur cluster [63]. The availability of Photosystem I reaction center 'core protein' preparations that contain Fx as the only iron-sulfur cluster [63] has allowed the unambiguous identification of this center as a [4Fe-4S] cluster by X-ray edge spectroscopy (EXAFS) and MSssbauer spectroscopy [64,65], confirming the conclusion of earlier MSssbauer studies conducted with less purified Photosystem I preparations [66]. The conclusion that F x is a [4Fe-4S] cluster is consistent with the observation that resolved Photosystem I core protein preparations that contain this center as the only iron-sulfur prosthetic group contain approx. 4 inorganic sulfides and 4 nonheme irons per P700 [67,68]. Oxidation-reduction titrations of F x indicate that it is among the strongest known reductants present in biological systems. (Presumably the earlier acceptors in the Photosystem I reaction center, A 0 and Aa, have more negative E m values than that of Fx, but these E m values have not yet been measured.) Oxidation-reduction titrations of Fx, using the EPR signal of the reduced cluster to monitor the redox state of the cluster, indicate an E m value of - 7 0 5 mV for F~ [69]. A less negative E m value of - 6 7 0 mV was calculated for Fx from the E h dependence of the magnitude of absorbance changes associated with the back reaction between P700 ÷ and F x [63]. The reason for the discrepancy between these two values for the E m of Fx is not known. It is possible that local coulombic effects can affect the oxidation-reduction properties of Fx, as its E m value is apparently shifted to - 6 1 0 mV when other reduced iron-sulfur clusters (the clusters referred to as Centers A and B, see below) normally present during determinations of the E m value of Fx are removed from the Photosystem I reaction center [63].

98 proposed [63,71,72,72a] that the [4Fe-4S] cluster of Fx bridges the two subunits of the heterodimeric Photosystern I reaction center core, with the psaA and psaB proteins each providing two cysteine ligands to the cluster. This likely bridging arrangement of F~ between the two large subunits of the Photosystem I reaction center is shown in Fig. 4 [83a]. The molecular masses of the two largest subunits given in Fig. 4, 82 kDa and 83 kDa, are those calculated from the amino acid sequences, rather than the lower apparent molecular masses calculated from migration distances during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions [63,67,68,71-74,84]. product contains the two [4Fe-4S] clusters, known either as Centers A and B, or FA and F B, that serve as the final electron acceptors within the Photosystem I reaction center [68,77,78,85-87,94,95]. Amino acid sequences for the psaC gene product indicate the presence of eight conserved cysteine residues with the appropriate spacing for two sets of four cysteines that function as ligands to [4Fe-4S] clusters in iron-sulfur proteins for which X-ray crystal structures are available (Fig. 5). The EPR spectrum, non-heine iron and acid-labile sulfide content of the isolated psaC protein also are consistent with the presence of two [4Fe-4S] clusters being present in the protein [68,77,78,85-87,94,95]. Earlier EPR and MiSssbauer spectroscopic investigations of FA and F B had also suggested that both were [4Fe-4S] rather than [2Fe-2S] clusters [96,97]. It has recently been demonstrated that the purified spinach psaC protein can restore FA and FB function to a cyanobacterial Photosystem I core protein from which the psaC protein had been removed by treatment with chaotropic agents [94,95], conclusively establishing the subunit location of these two iron-sulfur clusters. The original identification of FA and F~ as electron acceptors associated with the Photosystem I reaction center was based on EPR spectra of Photosystem I

Fig. 4 also shows the probable arrangement of three smaller subunits of the Photosystem I reaction center with molecular masses of 9, 19 and 22 kDa, respectively. The three subunits are coded for by the psaC [68,77,78,85-87], psaF [88,89] and psaD [90-93] genes, respectively. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, the psaC gene is located on the chloroplast DNA, while the psaD and psaF genes are located on nuclear DNA [85-92]. There is now good agreement that the 9 kDa psaC gene

Oxidation-reduction titrations revealed the presence of two different clusters: FA with an E m value of approx. - 5 4 0 mV [101,103] and g values 2.05, 1.94 and 1.86 [98,101,103-105] and F B with an E m value of approx. - 5 9 0 mV [101,103] and g values of 2.07, 1.93 and 1.88 [101,103-105]. Magnetic interactions between the two clusters, presumably made possible by their close proximity, result in shifts in the g values observed for one reduced cluster when the other cluster becomes reduced [101,103-106]. Although the initial observations made with spinach Photosystem I indicated that only FA accumulated in the reduced form during illumination at cryogenic temperatures [98-100], subsequent experiments, some conducted with Photosystem I preparations isolated from other organisms, revealed that reduced F B could also accumulate during low-temperature illumination [102,104,105,107]. These observations, and others [108,109], have resulted in some uncertainty as to whether the electron transfer pathway from Fx to soluble ferrodoxin proceeds linearly through FA and F B or whether there is a branch in the pathway at this point [37]. For the sake of simplicity, a linear scheme for the light-dependent transfer of electrons from plastocyanin to ferredoxin, carried out by Photosystem I is given in Fig. 6, with the order of the components assigned on the basis of both kinetic studies and E m values. It should be kept in mind that this linear scheme may overly simplify the actual pathway of electron flow. The detailed kinetics of the electron transfer steps from F x to FA a n d / o r F~ are not known. Optical absorbance changes presumed to be associated with the reduction of these centers (originally attributed to a component referred to as P430 [110-112] have been used to argue that electrons leaving P700 arrive at one of the psaC protein prosthetic groups in less than 100 ns. However, it is possible that the spectral changes originally attributed to the reduction of FA a n d / o r F B may actually arise from the photoreduction of F x [113].

III-D. Docking proteins
The reduction of ferredoxin by the Photosystem I reaction center probably requires that this soluble, stromally-located, iron-sulfur protein dock, even if transiently, with at least one reaction center subunit. Recent cross-linking experiments have implicated the 22 kDa, psaD gene product in binding ferredoxin to the Photosystem I reaction center [114,115]. Cross-linking of spinach ferredoxin to spinach thylakoid membranes or to Photosystem I reaction center preparations with the water soluble carbodiimide N-ethyt-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) resulted in the appearance of new peptide, detectable after electrophoresis, with an apparent molecular mass of approx. 40 kDa that was recognized by an antibody raised against ferredoxin [114,115] and by an antibody raised against the psaD gene product [115]. Similar results were obtained with Photosystem I in the cyanobacterium Synechoco¢cus sp. PCC 6302, where the psaD gene product ( M r = 17.5 kDa in cyanobacteria compared to 22 kDa in spinach) could be specifically cross-linked to spinach ferredoxin [116]. The cross-linked adduct between ferredoxin and the spinach Photosystem I reaction center was able to catalyze the photoreduction of equine cytochrome c (a reaction known to be ferredoxin-dependent) in the absence of exogenous ferredoxin [114,115], suggesting that ferredoxin had been cross-linked to its physiological binding site and could be photoreduced. The observation that the cross-linked adduct cannot catalyze N A D P + photoreduction [114,115] is consistent with the hypothesis that the photoreduced, cross-linked ferredoxin is immobilized and unable to diffuse to its binding site on ferredoxin : N A D P + oxidoreductase (FNR). However, experiments to be discussed below suggest the possibility that ferredoxin may be able to form a ternary complex between the Photosystem I reaction center and FNR. If this were to be the case, an alternative explanation for the inability of the cross-linked ferredoxin/ reaction center adduct to photoreduce N A D P + must be provided. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of four psaD proteins [116] shows striking conservation of positively charged amino acids, particularly of lysine residues (Fig. 7). As ferredoxin is a highly acidic protein (see above), it is likely that several of these conserved psaD lysines are involved in the electrostaticaUy-stabilized binding of ferredoxin to the Photosystem I reaction center under physiological conditions and serve as amino group donors in the EDC-dependent cross-linking reaction with ferredoxin.

tein precursor does not contain any regions characteristic of proteins that are imported across the thylakoid membrane [90]. The protein is rather polar and contains no obvious regions that could form a membrane-spanning helix [90]. These observations, and the results of labeling studies with a membrane-impermeant probe [117], are consistent with the proposed location of the

protein on the stromal-facing side of the Photosystem I reaction center (Fig. 4). Experiments similar to those described above for the psaD gene product have been used to clarify the role of the psaF gene product in binding plastocyanin to the Photosystem I reaction center [118-120]. Cross-linking of spinach plastocyanin to the Photosystem I reaction

101 center of spinach [118,119] or of maize mesophyll [120] chloroplasts using EDC produces only a single crosslinked adduct, identified with immunoblots, in which plastocyanin is bound to the 19 kDa product of the psaF gene. It should be mentioned that some uncertainty exists concerning the true function of this subunit, as there is one report that it may function as part of the fight-harvesting antenna system associated with Photosystem I [120a]. It is possible that some of the ambiguity in assigning a function to this peptide may arise from the fact that there are at least two peptides with similar molecular masses present in the Photosystem I reaction center. As described above, in some organisms a soluble c-type cytochrome replaces plastocyanin as the direct electron donor to P700 +. It has been demonstrated that in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301, this soluble electron donor, cytochrome c-553, is specifically cross-linked to a 17 kDa subunit of the Photosystem I reaction center [116]. Although the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301 17 kDa protein does not show any significant homology to that of the plastocyanin-binding, spinach psaF gene product, the observation that an antibody raised against the spinach protein recognizes the cyanobacterial protein [116] indicates that the two proteins are structurally related. The complete amino acid sequence of the cyanobacterial psaF gene product would be of interest from a comparative point of view. The cross-linking of plastocyanin to the Photosystem I reaction center in spinach appears to conserve the orientation of plastocyanin found under physiological conditions, as the cross-linked plastocyanin can reduce photooxidized P700 ÷ with a halftime identical to that seen in situ [119]. The observation that plastocyanin, pretreated to block side-chain carboxyl residues, cannot be cross-linked to the spinach psaF protein [118] suggests that negatively charged groups on plastocyanin are involved in the interaction of this soluble electron donor with the psaF protein. Studies of the effect of ionic strength on the rate of P700 + reduction by plastocyanin suggest that plastocyartin and its Photosystem I docking target are oppositely charged [121]. As plastocyanin will be negatively charged at all pH values likely to be found in the thylakoid lumen [121,122], its docking protein should provide a region of net positive charge. Predictions made from the amino acid sequence of the spinach psaF protein indiciate that it contains a net excess of seven positively charged amino acid residues [88,119]. The N-terminal leader sequence of the psaF protein precursor is consistent with transport of the protein across the thylakoid membrane [89], suggesting a location for this Photosystem I reaction center component facing towards the thylakoid lumenal space (Fig. 4) where plastocyanin is known to be oxidized [121]. In summary, we now have a reasonably complete picture of the number and identity of the electron-carrying prosthetic groups of the Photosystem I reaction center, of the peptides to which they are bound, and of the sequence of electron transfer steps involved in the photoreduction of soluble ferredoxin. A picture of the topography of the Photosystem I reaction center is beginning to emerge and recent advances in the crystallization of this reaction center [123,124] promise more detailed structural information in the near future. Readers interested in more details than are presented above should consult Refs. 84, 124a,b for excellent reviews. With this knowledge of how ferredoxin is reduced, we will turn to a discussion of how reduced ferredoxin is utilized in the chloroplast stroma for the reduction of NADP +, of nitrite, of thioredoxin and for the reductive conversion of glutamine plus 2-oxoglutarate to glutamate.
IV. N A D P + :ferredoxin oxidoreductase

IV-A. Structure
Ferredoxin : NADP + oxidoreductase (EC 1.18.1.2, hereafter abbreviated FNR) has been isolated and extensively characterized from a number of plant, algal and cyanobacterial sources [125]. The primary function of FNR in vivo is to catalyze electron flow from ferredoxin, reduced by the light-driven reactions of Photosystem I that were described above, to NADP ÷ [125]. The proteins are monomeric, with molecular masses near 35 kDa, and contain a single, non-covalently bound FAD prosthetic group. Procedures are available for removing the FAD group and then reconstituting the enzyme by readdition of FAD [126,127]. There have been reports that the purified enzyme exists in multiple forms [128,129]. These forms are probably not true isozymes, as some are interconvertable and appear to differ only in the oxidation state of sulfur-containing amino acids [129]. Heterogeneity may also arise from proteolysis of FNR at the amino terminus during the isolation and purification of the enzyme [130,130a]. Amino acid sequences are available for FNR from spinach [130,131], pea [132], ice plant (Mesembryantheum crystallinum - Ref. 133) and the cyanobacterium Spirulina sp. [134]. In the case of Spirulina sp. FNR, the sequence was obtained from amino acid sequencing of the protein itself. In the case of spinach FNR, identical sequences were obtained from the protein and from an amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene. The gene coding for the mature form of spinach FNR has recently been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli [134a]. For pea and ice plant, the amino acid sequences were deduced from the gene sequences. Table II summarizes the currently available sequences. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, FNR is coded for by a nuclear

gene and synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes as a precursor protein containing an N-terminal leader sequence that targets it for transport across the chloroplast envelope [31,131-133]. The leader sequence is cleaved by a specific proteinase [31] and the mature protein becomes attached to the stromal-facing side of the thylakoid membrane [125-135].

F N R appears to be attached to the thylakoid membrane by a specific, intrinsic binding protein that is accessible from the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane [125,136-140a]. It has been suggested that the 17.5 kDa FNR-binding protein may be identical to a 16.5 kDa protein, previously characterized as a component of the chloroplast oxygen-evolving system [141].

103 However, recent immunological and amino acid sequence data indicate that the two proteins are not identical [141a]. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this 17.5 kDa, putative FNR-binding protein also indicates that it is not identical to either the psaE or psaF gene product components of the Photosystem I reaction center [141a]. An additional 10 kDa protein, named 'connectein', also may be involved in the binding of F N R to the thylakoid membrane [141b,c]. F N R behaves as an allotopic protein [137], with the isolated, purified enzyme differing from membrane-bound F N R in several properties [142-145]. Furthermore, the affinity of the enzyme for its substrates appears to be regulated through energization of the thylakoids [142,143]. These extremely interesting aspects of F N R fall outside the scope of this article, but the interested reader can consult Ref. 125 for an excellent review of this topic. The X-ray crystal structure of spinach F N R has been solved at a resolution of 0.37 nm [146]. Although no atomic details were available at this resolution, certain important features of the protein could be discerned. The molecule contains two different structural domains and a model of the NADP+-binding region, located near the carboxy terminus of the enzyme, could be constructed [146,146a]. The proposed NADP+-binding site is exposed to the solvent, as predicted from other observations [147], and is shaped into a 'Rossmann fold', a structure often seen at the nucleotide-binding sites of dehydrogenases and kinases [146]. The dinucleotide pocket provided by this 'fold' consists of five parallel pleated strands connected by a-helical regions [146a]. These earlier interpretations, based on the relatively low resolution structure then available, have been confirmed in a refined 0.22 nm resolution structure that has recently become available (Karplus, P.A., personal communication, and Karplus, P.A., Daniels, M. and Herriott, J.R., unpublished data). Neither the exact orientation of NADP + within the pocket nor any details of the FAD-binding geometry could be discerned from the 0.37 nm resolution structure. However, information concerning these aspects of F N R will be available from the forthcoming 0.22 nm resolution structure. ferredoxin causing a decrease in binding affinity for N A D P + [149,149a]. Studies of NADP + binding using spectral perturbations [148-155] have demonstrated, among other things, that there is one binding site for NADP + on the enzyme, that N A D P H is bound more tightly ( K d-- 1 /~M) than is NADP + ( K d = 14 /~M [155]) and that the 2'-adenosyl phosphate and one or both of the phosphate moieties of the pyrophosphate bridge of NADP + contribute significantly to the strength and specificity of pyridine nucleotide binding [155]. The measured difference in the binding affinities of N A D P + and N A D P H for the enzyme leads to the prediction that the E m value of the pyridine nucleotide should shift to a more positive value on binding to the enzyme. Oxidation-reduction titrations of the N A D P + / F N R complex are somewhat difficult to interpret because of ambiguities in the assignment of electron distribution between the pyridine nucleotide and the FAD group of the enzyme [155]. However, these titrations appear to show that the E m value of the enzyme-bound pyridine nucleotide is approx. 40 mV more positive than that of the free N A D P + / N A D P H couple [155]. Thus binding of the substrate makes electron transfer from the FADHz group of the enzyme to N A D P + (i.e., in the physiologically significant direction) thermodynamically more favorable. At pH 8.0, there is a AE m of approx. 80 mV for the two electron transfer from the F A D H 2 of the enzyme (E m = - 3 8 0 mV [155-157]) to the bound N A D P +. Binding to NADP + to F N R had no detectable effect on the E m value of the enzyme's FAD group, indicating that the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme do not differ significantly in binding affinity for the pyridine nucleotide substrate [155]. One region of F N R that is likely to be involved in binding NADP + has been identified [158] by covalent labeling of the enzyme with a pyridine nucleotide analog, 2',3'-dialdehyde N A D P + (periodate-oxidized NADP+). The analog selectively labels a single lysine residue at position 244 in the spinach enzyme [158]. This lysine, which is present in all four known F N R sequences, is located in a highly conserved section of the enzyme (see Table II). Treatment of F N R with dansyl chloride, a reagent known to modify the ~-amino group of lysine, results in an inhibition of pyridine nucleotide-binding by both the spinach enzyme [159] and F N R isolated from the alga BumilleriopsisfiliJbrmis [160]. The lysine that is dansylated in the spinach enzyme has been identified as lysine 116 [161]. Modification of a single lysine residue in spinach F N R by the triplet probe eosin isothiocyanate completely inhibited pyridine nucleotide binding to the enzyme [162]. Eosin itself binds to the enzyme competitively with N A D P + / N A D P H ( K i -~ 5 /zM [162]). The lysine modified by eosin isothiocyanate has been shown to be one of the seven lysines in the segment containing amino acids 179-228 [162]. Structural calculations predicted that

IV-B. NADP + binding
Convincing evidence that F N R contains separate binding sites for NADP + and ferredoxin was obtained by first using spectral perturbations to demonstrate complex formation between the enzyme and each of its substrates separately and then demonstrating the formation of a ternary complex between FNR, NADP + and ferredoxin [148-150]. Negative cooperativity between the two binding sites has been reported, with the binding of NADP + causing a decrease in the affinity of F N R for oxidized ferredoxin and the binding of oxidized

104 this portion of FNR contains two helicies that were likely to comprise part of the a / f l pyridine nucleotidebinding fold [162]. Thus three lysine residues, all located in different regions of the primary sequence of FNR (lysine 116, lysine 244, and one lysine located between residue 178 and 228), have been implicated in NADP ÷ binding. The recent 0.22 nm resolution structure of the enzyme locates lysine 244 and the lysines between residues 178 and 228 within the putative NADP+-binding domain (Karplus, P.A., personal communication). Lysine 244 probably interacts with NADP ÷, but the lysines between residues 178 and 228 do not appear to be close enough to the NADP÷-binding site to interact directly with the pyridine nucleotide (Karplus, P.A., personal communication). Lysine 116, although located in the FAD-binding domain of the enzyme, does interact with NADP ÷ (Karplus, P.A., personal communication). Evidence obtained from treatment of FNR with reagents known to modify arginine residues has also suggested the involvement of a single arginine residue at the NADP+-binding sites of FNR's from spinach [163], Bumilleriopsin filiformis [153,160] and the cyanoabacterium Anabaena variabilis [164]. A partial amino acid sequence of the A. variabilis FNR suggests that it will prove to be quite homologous to the Spirulina sp. enzyme (Ref. 165 and see Table II). The recent 0.22 nm resolution FNR structure confirms the presence of an arginine residue at the NADP+-binding site of the spinach enzyme (Karplus, P.A., personal communication). Spinach FNR has also been shown to be inactivated by treatment with the histidine-modifying reagent, diethyl pyrocarbonate [166]. The observations that carbethoxylation of FNR inhibited NADP + binding by the enzyme and that NADP + protected the enzyme against inactivation by diethyl pyrocarbonate were interpreted in terms of a single histidine residue at the NADP+-binding site [166]. This histidine is the only histidine in the enzyme that is rapidly modified by diethyl pyrocarbonate, suggesting that it is relatively exposed to the solvent and that the other four histidines are considerably less accessible [166]. 1H-NMR measurements with spinach FNR indicate that only one of the five histidine residues in the enzyme can be readily titrated. The pK of this histidine decreases when NADP + binds to the enzyme, identifying the histidine at the NADP+-binding site as the single solvent-exposed histidine [125]. In addition to the presence of positively charged lysine and arginine residues and of a potentially cationic histidine at the NADP+-binding site of the enzyme, it is possible that the pyridine nucleotide-binding site also contains an essential carboxylate group [167,168]. Woodward's reagent K (N-ethyl-5phenylisoxazolium 3'-sulfonate) inactivates the enzyme and eliminates the ability of FNR to bind NADP + [167]. Both NADP + and NADPH completely protect spinach FNR against inactivation, with the pyridine nucleotide and the modifying reagent competing for the same site on the enzyme [167,168]. Inhibition could be attributed to the modification of one carboxyl group per molecule of enzyme [167].

IV-C. Ferredoxin binding
FNR is able to form a 1:1, electrostatically stabilized complex with ferredoxin [125]. Complex formation has been documented using a wide variety of techniques, including: the measurement of perturbations in absorbance [148,151-153,169,170], circular dichroism [171-173] and fluorescence spectra [172,174]; co-migration during gel filtration chromatography [172,175,176]; analytical ultracentrifugation [152]; isoelectric focusing [159]; membrane ultrafiltration [176] and cross-linking [29,150,177,179]. The complex dissociates at high ionic strengths, as expected for an electrostatically stabilized association. K d values at physiological ionic strengths have been estimated to range from 1 to 10/~M for the complexes from a number of different species [125,152, 153,180]. The stability of the complex is also pH-dependent [180], with the K d increasing as the pH increases from 6 to 8. Above pH 9, K d is pH-independent. The pH-dependence of the binding affinity has been interpreted in terms of the uptake of a single proton during complex formation. The group that is protonated on complex formation has its pK a shifted from 6 in the free protein to 8 in the complex [180]. Although all the early experiments demonstrating complex formation were performed with both proteins in their oxidized states, complex formation also occurs between the reduced proteins [157,180,181]. The strength of the protein:protein binding in the FNR/ferredoxin complex is affected by the oxidation-reduction state of the proteins, with the oxidized form of ferredoxin binding more strongly to FNR than the reduced form and the reduced form of FNR binding ferredoxin more tightly than does oxidized FNR [180,181]. These effects of oxidation state on binding affinities, like those described above for the N A D P + / F N R complex, are reflected in effects of complex formation on the E m values of both ferredoxin and FNR [157,180]. The changes in E m values that result from complex formation make electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to the FAD group of FNR thermodynamically more favorable than would be the case for the uncomplexed proteins (see below). Evidence from 13C-NMR experiments [182], chemical modification studies [29,183] and cross-linking experiments [29,177,179] have established that ferredoxin contributes the negatively charged groups involved in complex formation with FNR. The NMR experiments, conducted with 13C-enriched ferredoxin isolated from the cyanobacterium A. variabilis, indicated that there are

105 likely to be three ferredoxin glutamate residues at or near the contact region with FNR in the complex formed between the cyanobacterial ferredoxin and spinach FNR [182]. Chemical modification of spinach ferredoxin, in which 3 to 4 carboxyl groups were altered to remove their negative charges by treatment witfi glycine ethyl ester and a water-soluble carbodiimide, resulted in a substantial decrease in the ability of ferredoxin to bind to spinach FNR [29,183]. Peptide mapping of the modified ferredoxin located three regions of the protein in which carboxyl groups had been modified [29]. These regions (Fig. 3), which were thus identified as putative domains on ferredoxin that might be involved in binding FNR, were: the region containing amino acid residues 26-30; the region containing residues 65-70 and the region from residue 92 to residue 94 [29]. The sequence of three consecutive glutamate residues at positions 92-94 were proposed to be the most likely spot for binding to FNR because of its relative proximity to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ferredoxin (Fig. 8). Analysis of the sites of cross-linking in a complex in which ferredoxin and FNR were covalently linked by a water-soluble carbodiimide after the electrostaticallystabilized complex was allowed to form, identified some of the specific carboxyl groups on ferredoxin [29,177] and the specific lysine c-amino groups on FNR involved in linking the two proteins [177]. The major site of cross-linking on ferredoxin was somewhere in the region containing amino acid residues 76 to 97, with the most likely site being one of the three consecutive glutamic acid residues, 92-94 (Fig. 8). As both cross-finking and chemical modification approaches have implicated this acidic region near the carboxy terminus and because of the relative proximity of these amino acids to the [2Fe2S] cluster, it seems likely that one or more of glutamates 92-94 are in fact involved in the electrostatic binding of ferredoxin to FNR. A second, minor site of cross-linking to FNR was identified as the region from amino acid residue 5 to residue 37 of ferredoxin, with the aspartate residues at positions 20, 21 or 26 being the most likely carboxyl donors in this linkage [177]. Chemical modification studies (see above) also suggest that the region on ferredoxin containing aspartate 26 may be involved in binding to FNR [29]. The cross-linking experiments also allowed the identification of the FNR amino acids that contributed amino groups to the carbodiimide-induced covalent linkages [177]. The FNR residue(s) acting as the amino group donor(s) to the major cross-linking site is lysine 85 a n d / o r lysine 88. Both of these lysines are conserved in all three known sequences for higher plant FNR's [130,132-134]. Lysine 88 is also conserved in the Spirulina sp. FNR, whereas lysine 85 of the higher plant FNR's is replaced by an asparagine in the Spirulina sp. sequence (Ref. 131 and see Table II). The recent 0.22 nm resolution X-ray structure of spinach FNR indicates that these lysines are in relatively close proximity to the FAD prosthetic group of the enzyme, as would be expected if ferredoxin were to be positioned at a docking site on FNR suitable for efficient electron transfer between the two proteins in the complex (Karplus, P.A., personal communication). The minor cross link involved the a-amino group of the isoleucine that was reported to be at the anaino terminus of FNR by Zanetti et al. [177]. However, Karplus et al. have reported that isoleucine is the second rather than the first amino acid in FNR, with the true amino terminus being a pyroglutamyl residue [130]. As mentioned above, there have been reports from several laboratories that multiple forms of FNR may arise from proteolysis and this may have occurred with the FNR preparation utilized by Zanetti and co-workers for the cross-linking experiments. In fact, Zanetti et al. reported that their FNR preparation also contained some enzyme with a pyroglutamyl residue at the N-terminus [177] and it is thus likely that the major form in their preparation, with isoleucine at the N-terminus, arose from proteolysis of the true N-terminal pyroglutamyl residue (Zanetti, G., personal communication). Thus, the minor cross-link to the a-amino group of isoleucine may not represent a

106 point of physiologically significant interaction between ferredoxin and FNR. Although cross-linking experiments have not implicated other regions near the N-terminus of FNR in binding ferredoxin, recent measurements on FNR which had been subjected to limited proteolysis with either trypsin or chymotrypsin [178] and on a genetically engineered, truncated form of spinach FNR expressed in E. coli [134a], suggest that the FNR region from Lys-22 to Phe-32 is likely to be involved in ferredoxin binding. It was proposed that within this putative ferredoxin-binding region of FNR, the amino acids from Val-29 to Phe-32 play a more important role in binding ferredoxin than do the amino acids from Lys-22 to Thr-28 [178]. The region of spinach FNR from Ile-27 to Asn-49 is highly conserved in all four FNR's for which sequences are available, with 11 completely conserved residues and 2 conservative substitutions in a stretch of 19 amino acids (see Table 1I). This high degree of conservation and the presence of three positively charged lysine residues in this region, are consistent with its functioning as part of the binding domain for the negatively charged ferredoxin. In addition to the presence of lysine residues at the FNR binding site for ferredoxin, it appears possible that at least one FNR arginine residue is also involved in electrostatic complex formation with ferredoxin. Treatment of the spinach FNR with the arginine-modifying reagent 2,3-butanedione resulted in 70% inactivation of the enzyme when two arginine residues were modified [163]. The enzyme could be partially protected against this inactivation by NADP ÷ (see above) and could also be protected against butanedione inactivation by ferredoxin [163]. These results were interpreted in terms of the presence of one arginine residue at the NADP+-binding site (see above) and a second arginine residue at the ferredoxin-binding site of FNR. The precise location of the arginine at the ferredoxin-binding site is not yet clear. However, there is an arginine at position 93 in the spinach enzyme that is conserved in all four known FNR sequences (Table II). This arginine is part of a well-conserved, positively charged region of FNR that also contains the two lysine residues implicated in ferredoxin binding by cross-linking experiments (see above). NMR experiments using the Cr(CN)63- anion as a probe have implicated a highly positive region, such as that from residues 85 to 93, in binding ferredoxin [184]. It has also been concluded, based on the protective effect of ferredoxin against inactivation by phenylglyoxal, that an arginine residue is present at the ferredoxin-binding site of the FNR isolated from the cyanobacterium A. variabilis [164]. However, chemical modification, studies of Bumilleriopsis filiformis FNR showed no effect of arginine modification by butanedione on the ferredoxin-binding capability of the enzyme [153]. It may thus be possible that the ferredoxin-binding site of some, but not all, FNR's contain arginine. In addition to the likely presence of positively charged lysine and arginine residues at the ferredoxin-binding site of FNR, some evidence suggests that aromatic amino acids [174,185] and cysteine [186] may also be present at interaction interface between these two proteins. Complex formation between the two proteins results in the quenching of FNR tryptophan fluorescence by approx. 50% and titration of this quenching as a function of ferredoxin concentration gives a K d for ferredoxin in good agreement with that calculated from other data [174]. Six tryptophan residues are strictly conserved in the three known higher plant FNR sequences [130,132-134], with five of these also conserved in the Spirulina sp. FNR sequence [131]. This degree of conservation suggests that tryptophan residues may play some essential role in the function of the enzyme and the quenching results suggest that two of these tryptophans may be at or near the ferredoxin-binding site [174]. Solvent perturbation measurements indicate that complex formation between FNR and ferredoxin results in a decreased exposure of tryptophan to the solvent [185], consistent with tl~'ptophan being present at the interaction domain between the two proteins. The solvent perturbation data also suggest that the interaction domains on one or both of the proteins may include tyrosine residues [185]. Spinach FNR has been reported to contain three thiols and a disulfide bridging the cysteines at positions 132 and 137 [130]. The two cysteines that contribute to this disulfide bridge are conserved in all four of the currently known FNR sequences [130-134]. However, there is some evidence that the disulfide bride may result from cysteine oxidation during the denaturation of the enzyme for sequencing [187]. The recent 0.22 resolution structure indicates that the native enzyme does not contain a disulfide (Karplus, P.A., personal communication). Treatment of membrane-bound spinach FNR with iodosobenzoate, a reagent known to oxidize vicinal dithiols, inhibited the ferredoxin-dependent NADP + reduction catalyzed by the enzyme, but had little or no effect on the ability of the enzyme to catalyze ferredoxin-independent electron flow from NADPH to ferricyanide [186]. The loss of two FNR sulfhydryl groups that resulted from treatment with iodobenzoate also interfered with the ability of the enzyme to form a complex with ferredoxin [186]. Furthermore, the loss of enzymatic activity could be partially prevented by pre-addition of ferredoxin [186]. These results suggest that a pair of cysteine residues may be present at or near the ferredoxin-binding site of FNR. Whether one of these cysteines is the same cysteine that appears to be involved in the binding of the FAD prosthetic group to the enzyme [156,188,189] has not yet been determined. Deprotonation of a cysteine

107 residue with a pK near 8.0 results in the conversion of FNR from a less active to a more active form [190], but whether this cysteine is also involved in ferredoxin binding is not yet clear. The solvent perturbation studies cited above indicate that certain amino acid side chains which are exposed to the solvent in the isolated proteins become less accessible to solvent upon complex formation between the two proteins. Evidence also exists that complex formation between ferredoxin and FNR affects the exposure of the prosthetic groups of both proteins to the solvent [149,191]. The o-phenanthroline complex of the rapidly relaxing paramagnetic rare earth ion Dy 3+ broadens the EPR signal of reduced spinach ferredoxin through dipolar interactions [191]. The extent of broadening was substantially decreased if FNR were present under conditions known to favor complex formation between the two proteins, indicating that the [2Fe-2S] cluster of reduced ferredoxin is less exposed to the positively charged, hydrophilic probe (and thus less exposed to the solvent) in the complex than in ferredoxin alone. The negatively charged EDTA complex of Dy 3+ was shown to produce a substantial broadening [149] of the neutral semiquinone EPR signal that results [192] when NADPH is added to FNR under aerobic conditions. This broadening was partially reversed by the addition of oxidized ferredoxin in amounts equimolar to FNR [149]. As this free radical EPR signal is thought to arise from FADH semiquinone [192], these results suggest that the FAD group of FNR, like the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ferredoxin, becomes less solvent exposed as a result of complex formation between the two proteins [149]. The relative ineffectiveness of the ophenanthroline complex of Dy 3+ in broadening the FNR semiquinone EPR signal and the relative ineffectiveness of the EDTA complex of Dy 3+ in broadening the EPR signal of ferredoxin were interpreted in terms of a negatively charged region surrounding the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ferredoxin and a positively charged region surrounding the FAD group of FNR [149]. A laser flash photolysis kinetic study of the reduction of ferredoxin, FNR and of the ferredoxin/FNR complex by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone also demonstrated that complex formation between the two proteins renders the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ferredoxin less accessible but showed no effect of complex formation on the reactivity of the FAD group of FNR with the 5deazariboflavin semiquinone [191]. IV-D. Oxidation-reduction properties and mechanism A detailed discussion of the kinetics of the reactions catalyzed by FNR falls outside the scope of a review article that concentrates on the structure, substratebinding and oxidation-reduction properties of the enzyme. However, questions about the role of the FAD semiquinone oxidation state of FNR in the reduction of NADP ÷ catalyzed by the enzyme and about possible effects of ferredoxin-FNR interactions on the redox properties of the proteins are in fact related to some of the redox properties of FNR discussed above. Furthermore, the question of whether the FNR/ferredoxin complex, characterized in measurements involving the isolated purified proteins, actually functions during NADP ÷ reduction in chloroplasts is also germane to the main subject of this review. Readers interested in a more detailed discussion of the likely mechanism(s) of FNR-catalyzed reactions should consult Refs. 125 and 193 for reviews.

(A) The oxidation state of the FAD group of FNR was monitored by following changes in the absorbance spectrum of FNR at different ambient potentials.

108 oxidation states of ferredoxin and F N R affect the E m values of both proteins [157,180]. Fig. 9A, taken from work performed in our laboratory, shows the results of an oxidation-reduction titration of the FAD group of F N R in the presence and absence of ferredoxin. The E m value for the F A D / F A D H 2 couple becomes 23 mV more positive under conditions where ferredoxin is complexed to the enzyme [157]. At high ionic strength, where dissociation of the f e r r e d o x i n / F N R complex is favored, the presence of ferredoxin has no effect of the E m value of FNR. Fig. 9B shows that the E m value for the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ferredoxin becomes 22 mV more negative on complex formation with F N R [157]. Results that agree qualitatively with those obtained in our laboratory were reported by Batie and Kamin [180]. However, these workers reported a considerably larger shift in the E m value for ferredoxin, from - 4 2 0 mV for ferredoxin itself to - 5 0 0 mV for ferredoxin bound to F N R [180]. The reasons for the differences in the magnitude of A E m observed by the two groups are not completely clear. However, this discrepancy may have arisen from differences in the ionic strength and p H at which the oxidation-reduction titrations were carried out, as the protein : protein binding affinities are known to be affected by both these parameters (see above). In any event, the results obtained in both laboratories indicate that complex formation increases the thermodynamic driving force for electron transfer in the physiological important direction, i.e., from ferredoxin to FNR. A similar improvement in the thermodynamic feasibility of electron transfer in the physiological direction resulting from complex formation between the enzyme and its pyridine nucleotide substrate was described above. There is good agreement between E m values measured in several laboratories for the F A D / F A D H 2 couple of spinach FNR. The earliest measurements, by Keirns and Wang [156], gave values of - 360 mV at p H 7.0 and - 3 9 0 mV at pH 8.0, Batie and Kamin [155] reported a value of - 3 7 6 mV at p H 8.0 and work in our laboratory [157] gave a value of - 3 7 2 mV at p H 7.3. In contrast, there is disagreement over the E m values for the two one-electron couples involving the semiquinone state. Keirns and Wang reported E m values (at pH 7.0) of - 3 2 0 mV and - 4 0 0 mV for the F A D / F A D " and F A D ' / F A D H 2 couples, respectively, based on titrations of the enzyme with N A D P H [156]. However, Batie and Kamin have pointed out that if the E m value for the oxidized F A D / F A D semiquinone couple were in fact 80 mV more positive than that of the s e m i q u i n o n e / F A D H 2 couple, one would expect to observe some semiquinone during equilibrium oxidation-reduction titrations using reductants other than N A D P H [155]. The lack of significant amounts of observable FAD semiquinone during such titrations [155157] allows one to calculate that the E m value for the oxidized F A D / F A D semiquinone couple is likely to be at least 90 mV more negative than that of the semiq u i n o n e / F A D H 2 couple [155]. One possible source of uncertainty in these measurements is that absorbance features that probably arise from a charge-transfer complex between N A D P H and F N R may have been mistakenly attributed to a FAD semiquinone [155]. Despite the uncertainty about the E m values of F N R redox couples involving the F A D semiquinone state, this state almost certainly plays a role in the enzymecatalyzed reduction of N A D P +. The FAD semiquinone state of F N R has been detected by EPR spectroscopy [149,192,194] and by optical absorbance measurements [191,195,196]. Both the optical and EPR spectra indicate that the semiquinone is the neutral rather than the anionic form [149,191,192,194,195], so that one proton is taken up during the one-electron reduction of the F A D group of FNR. As ferredoxin is a one-electron carrier and there is only a single ferredoxin-binding site for ferredoxin on FNR, it is difficult to imagine mechanisms for electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to the FAD group of the enzyme that do not involve at least the transient formation of the FAD semiquinone state. It has been known since some of the earliest studies on FNR-catalyzed electron transfer from ferredoxin to N A D P + that reduced ferredoxin can completely reduce the FAD group of F N R [196]. However, this net two-electron reduction, measured on a slow time-scale, could have resulted from two sequential one-electron transfers from two reduced ferredoxins. Flash photolysis experiments in which ferredoxin was rapidly reduced by the 5-deazariboflavin radical, allowed the measurement of the kinetic parameters for electron flow from reduced ferredoxin to F N R that produced the neutral FADH" semiquinone state of the enzyme [191]. At p H 7.0 and an ionic strength of 310 mM, the reaction was second-order (k = 1.5.108 M -1 . s - l ) . At high concentrations of FNR, the rate of electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to F N R became independent of F N R concentration, with a limiting first-order rate constant of 4000 s -a [191]. It was not possible to measure the kinetics of electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to F N R at low ionic strengths, where the binding of the two proteins is tight. Under these conditions, the shielding of the [2Fe-2S] group of ferredoxin from access to the 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone in solution that occurs in the F N R / f e r r e d o x i n complex (see above) results in initial reduction of F N R rather than of ferredoxin. Evidence from flash photolysis experiments using intact cells of the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa suggests that the FAD semiquinone state of F N R is also formed during the reduction of the enzyme by reduced ferredoxin in vivo [198-

the FAD semiquinone state of FNR. The E m value for the one-electron reduction of NAD + to NAD" in aqueous solution has been estimated, using pulse radiolysis techniques, to be between -920 [201] and -940 mV [202], suggesting that a one-electron reduction of NADP + by either the FADH" semiquinone or FADH 2 states of FNR would be thermodynamically impossible. However, the environment of NADP + at its binding site on FNR may differ considerably from that in aqueous solution. If this were to be the case, the E m value for the NADP+/NADP" couple at the pyridine nucleotide binding site of the enzyme could differ substantially from that in aqueous solution. Furthermore, favorable enzyme/substrate binding energy may stabilize the one-electron reduced NADP" at the pyridine nucleotide binding site of FNR. While it thus may be possible that pyridine nucleotide reduction proceeds through two sequential one electron steps, thermodynamic considerations make it seem more likely that the FAD group of the enzyme is first fully reduced and that the FADH 2 then reduces NADP + in a concerted twoelectron step (Fig. 10). In addition to questions concerning the role of the FAD semiquinone state in the mechanism of the enzyme, the role in the electron transfer reaction of the binary and ternary complexes described above must be addressed. The evidence given above for the existence of these complexes involves measurements that have been made under static conditions (i.e., conditions that do not involve turnover or electron transfer) and it is important to document the role of these complexes under turnover conditions. The effects of ionic strength [170,191] and chemical modification of either ferredoxin or FNR [125,29,183] on the kinetics of electron transfer

reactions catalyzed by FNR suggest that an electrostatically stabifized complex between the two proteins does in fact play a role in the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, kinetic studies suggest that the ternary complex between the enzyme, ferredoxin and NADP + also participates in electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to NADP + catalyzed by both the S. platensis and spinach enzymes [197,203]. Rapid kinetic studies conducted with spinach FNR indicate that NADP + binding, leading to ternary complex formation, increased the rate of electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to FNR by facilitating the dissociation of inhibitory, oxidized ferredoxin from F N R [197]. As the rate of electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to FNR can also be increased by the binding of a non-reducible NADP + analog [197], this effect is more likely to arise from the negative cooperativity between the ferredoxin and pyridine nucleotide binding sites in the ternary complex than from the electron accepting capacity of NADP +. Thus the negative cooperativity between the ferredoxin and pyridine nucleotide binding sites on FNR, detected in equilibrium binding measurements (see subsection IV-B), appears to play an important role in the enzyme mechanism. The effect of pyridine nucleotide binding on the triplet lifetime of an eosin probe attached to the putative ferredoxin-binding site of FNR provides additional evidence for cooperative interactions between the two separate substrate-binding sites on the enzyme [147,204]. The rapid kinetic measurements with spinach FNR, and steady-state kinetic investigations of the S. platensis enzyme [203], support a mechanism involving a ternary complex with an ordered addition of substrates to FNR (Fig. 10, Ref. 197). Evidence is also available in support of a role for the FNR/ferredoxin complex during NADP + photoreduction in vivo. The effects of pH and ionic strength on the K m for ferredoxin during NADP + photoreduction by thylakoid membranes are quite similar to those determined for the K d for ferredoxin in the electrostatically-stabilized complex formed between the two purified proteins [205]. There also appear to be some additional effects of the chloroplast membrane surface potential on the interaction of membrane-bound FNR with its substrates [185,205], but the interactions between the two proteins in situ do not appear to differ greatly from those observed with the purified proteins. Binding of FNR that had been covalently modified to incorporate a triplet probe by treatment with eosin isothiocyanate to thylakoid membranes has also been used to investigate interactions between FNR and ferredoxin in situ [204]. In the absence of ferredoxin, the rotational motion of FNR in the thylakoid membrane is quite rapid (the rotational diffusion correlation time is < 10 t~s at 10°C) but addition of ferredoxin greatly decreases the rotational motion, increasing the correlation time to 40 #s [204].

110 The results of studies with eosin-modified FNR that has been reconstituted into thylakoid membranes have resulted in a proposal that ferredoxin may mediate formation of a ternary complex with FNR and the Photosystem I reaction center [204]. Formation of such a ternary complex would be possible only if the binding site on ferredoxin for the Photosystem I reaction center differed from the site on ferredoxin involved in interaction with FNR. It is not clear how this possibility can easily be reconciled with the inability of the cross-linked ferredoxin/reaction center adduct to photoreduce NADP ÷ (see above) and with other data from crosslinking experiments that suggest ferredoxin cross-linked to the Photosystem I reaction center cannot be reduced via FNR by NADPH [206]. Obviously, additional experiments will be required to clarify the question of whether the same domain on ferredoxin is involved in both its oxidation and its reduction. In this regard, detailed information on the identity of specific amino acids on ferredoxin involved in the docking of ferredoxin to the Photosystem I psaD subunit will be particularly useful so that a comparison can be made with the amino acids known to be involved in binding to FNR.
V. Nitrite reductase and glutamate synthase

gen assimilation is completed by the reductive conversion of glutamine plus 2-oxoglutarate to two molecules of glutamate. This pathway (Fig. 11, Ref. 207) involves two ferredoxin-dependent steps: the 6-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia catalyzed by ferredoxin: nitrite oxidoreductase (EC 1.7.7.1, hereafter referred to as nitrite reductase) and the 2-electron reductive conversion of 2-oxoglutarate plus glutamine to glutamate catalyzed by glutamate synthase (EC 1.4.7.1). The conversion of glutamate plus ammonia to glutamine, catalyzed by glutamine synthetase, does not involve any change in the oxidation state of nitrogen. The two-electron reduction of nitrate to nitrite in plants and algae, catalyzed by nitrate reductase, utilizes reduced pyridine nucleotide, rather than reduced ferredoxin, as the electron donor [207]. Although much less is known about the structures and mechanisms of nitrite reductase and glutamate synthase than about that of FNR, evidence is emerging that these two soluble enzymes, located in the chloroplast stroma, both contain ferredoxin-binding sites that may be quite similar to that of FNR.

V-B. Nitrite reductase
It is clear that the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia catalyzed by nitrite reductase utilizes reduced ferredoxin as the electron donor for this process in vivo [207]. In both spinach and green algae, immunocytochemical techniques have confirmed earlier conclusions that the ferredoxin-dependent enzyme is localized in chloroplasts [207a,b], where ferredoxin is also localized. Since the early observation that reduced viologen dyes are excellent non-physiological electron donors for the reaction catalyzed by nitrite reductase [208], most puff-

111 fication protocols for the enzyme have utilized reduced methyl viologen rather than reduced ferredoxin as the electron donor for enzyme assays [209-217]. This has resulted in some controversy as to whether or not there are significant differences between 'viologen-linked' nitrite reductases and 'native' or 'ferredoxin-linked' nitrite reductases [209-217]. Many of the details of this controversy lie outside the scope of this review, but the subject will be covered briefly insofar as it relates to the likely mode of interaction between the enzyme and ferredoxin. The assumption will be made that there is only a single form of nitrite reductase present in chloroplasts and that the different properties of the enzyme reported by different groups, particularly with respect to subunit composition and prosthetic group content, result from alterations of the enzyme during purification. However, the possibility that more than one form of nitrite reductase is present in vivo, while speculative, cannot be eliminated on the basis of currently available data.
V-B.I. Prosthetic group content

Assimilatory nitrite reductases have been isolated from a number of higher plants [209-215,217-225], algae [216,226-227a] and cyanobacteria [228-230]. These enzymes contain siroheme (Fig. 12) as a prosthetic group. There is some uncertainty as to the siroheme content of the enzyme, arising in part from the fact that chemical analysis for siroheme does not produce 100% recovery of the chromophore and also from the possibility that this non-covalently bound heme may be partially lost during purification of the enzyme [218,231]. The best estimate available for monomeric forms of the enzyme appears to be that there is one siroheme present per enzyme molecule [214]. There is, however, one report that a heterodimeric preparation of the enzyme may contain two sirohemes [232]. Oxidation-reduction titrations of the enzyme, using either EPR [225,233,234] or optical [217] features to monitor the oxidation state of the siroheme, yield different estimates for the E m value in different preparations of the enzyme. Titrations, using EPR detection, of monomeric forms of the squash [234] and barley [225] enzymes and of a preparation of the spinach enzyme for

which the molecular weight was not determined [233], yielded E m values of - 120, + 80 and - 50 mV, respectively. A titration, using optical absorbance changes to monitor the oxidation state of the siroheme, yielded E m values of - 3 0 and - 3 0 5 mV for monomeric and heterodimeric preparations, respectively, of the spinach enzyme [217]. The latter value is similar to the E m = - 3 4 0 mV value reported [235] for the siroheme prosthetic group of E. coli N A D P H : sulfite oxidoreductase (EC 1.8.1.2, hereafter referred to as E. coil sulfite reductase). In addition to siroheme, nitrite reductase contains an iron-sulfur cluster that is detectable by EPR spectroscopy [225,231-234,236]. Non-heme iron and inorganic sulfide content measurements indicate the presence of 4 non-heme irons and 4 inorganic sulfides per siroheme in spinach nitrite reductase [210,214,231]. EPR spectra of the reduced enzyme in 80% dimethylsulfoxide suggest that the enzyme contains a single [4Fe-4S] cluster, rather than two [2Fe-2S] dusters [231]. Oxidationreduction titrations on the [4Fe-4S] cluster have not been performed with unambiguously heterodimeric preparations of the enzyme, but a pH-dependent E m value has been determined for the monomeric squash enzyme (Em values of - 5 7 0 , - 6 1 5 and - 6 6 0 mV were measured at p H values of 8.1, 8.7 and 9.8, respectively [234]) and an E m value of - 5 1 7 mV has been estimated for the barley enzyme at p H 7.5 [225]. The E m value of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of a preparation of the spinach enzyme for which the molecular weight was not determined was estimated to be - 5 5 0 mV at p H 9.0 [233]. Spinach, squash and barley nitrite reductases resemble spinach ferredoxin:sulfite oxidoreductase (EC 1.8.7.1, hereafter referred to as spinach sulfite reductase) and the hemoprotein subunit of E. coil sulfite reductase in prosthetic group content [237,238]. The two spinach enzymes resemble each other further in that both catalyze the ferredoxin- or methyl viologen-dependent reduction of nitrite to ammonia, sulfite to sulfide and hydroxylamine to ammonia [238]. MSssbauer [239] and EPR [240] studies of the E. coli sulfite reductase and EPR studies of spinach sulfite reductase [241] provided evidence for strong magnetic coupling, probably through a common bridging ligand, between the siroheme and the [4Fe-4S] duster in both enzymes. MSssbauer [239], EPR and optical spectroscopic evidence [242] for a similar magnetic interaction between the [4Fe-4S] cluster and siroheme prosthetic groups of spinach nitrite reductase has also been obtained. X-ray data on the hemoprotein subunit of the E. coli sulfite reductase indicate that the iron of the siroheme and one of the non-heme irons of the [4Fe-4S] cluster are separated by only 0.44 nm and that the two irons appear to be bridged by a single amino acid, possibly a sulfur from one of the cluster cysteines [243]. There is a second site of interaction between the two prosthetic groups,

112 with one of the inorganic sulfides of the cluster making Van der Waals contact with an edge of the siroheme macrocycle [243]. In view of the many other similarities between nitrite and sulfite reductases, a similar arrangement of the prosthetic groups of chloroplast nitrite reductases should be considered likely. pression [246,247]. As would be expected in the case of a protein encoded by a nuclear gene, synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and subsequently transported across the chloroplast envelope into the stromal space, nitrite reductase is synthesized as a larger, precursor form and subsequently the N-terminal leader sequence is cleaved [224,244-247]. The mature spinach enzyme, which contains 562 amino acids and a deduced molecular mass of 62883 Da, is derived by cleavage of a 32-amino-acid-long N-terminal extension [244]. The spinach and maize enzymes are 66% homologous at the amino acid level and 86% similar when conservative amino acid substitutions are taken into account [245]. Although these nitrite reductase sequences have not allowed any assignments to be made of amino acids likely to be involved in siroheme-binding, four conserved cysteines (located at positions 473, 479, 514 and 518 in the spinach sequence) that are likely to serve as ligands to the [4Fe-4S] cluster have been identified [244,245]. N-terminal amino acid analysis of the purified spinach enzyme (Refs. 214, 244, and also Hilliard, N., Hirasawa, M., Knaff, D.B. and Shaw, R.W., unpublished observations) revealed some heterogeneity that probably arises from proteolysis of the enzyme during isolation.

V-B.2. Subunit composition As indicated above, there has been controversy over the subunit composition of chloroplast nitrite reductases. Most groups working with the enzyme have reported that it is a monomeric protein, with a molecular mass between 61 and 63 kDa, depending on the species from which the enzyme was isolated [214,215,218-220,223-225]. However, two groups have reported that the spinach enzyme contains two subunits, of 61 and 24 kDa, respectively [209-213,217,232], and nitrite reductase isolated from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was reported to contain a 63 kDa and a 25 kDa subunit [216]. The nitrite reductase isolated from etiolated bean shoots was also reported to be a heterodimer, with the two subunits having molecular masses of 66 and 35 kDa [222]. In the case of the spinach heterodimer, it was reported that both the siroheme and [4Fe-4S] prosthetic groups are located on the larger, 61 or 63 kDa, subunit [211,213,232]. Treatment of the spinach or C. reinhardtii enzymes to remove the smaller subunit had little or no effect on the ability of the larger subunit to catalyze nitrite reduction with reduced methyl viologen serving as the electron donor but did result in a large decrease in activity when reduced ferredoxin was supplied as the electron donor [211,213,216,217]. These results were interpreted in terms of a role for the smaller subunit in ferredoxin binding [211,213,216,217] and, indeed, the 24 kDa subunit of the spinach enzyme was shown to contain a relatively high-affinity ferredoxin-binding site [213]. The small subunit of the spinach enzyme was, by itself, devoid of catalytic activity, consistent with its lack of electron-carrying prosthetic groups [211,213,217]. The possible role of the small subunit and the question of whether the enzyme actually contains a second subunit will be discussed in more detail below. The genes for two plant, ferredoxin-dependent nitrite reductases have been cloned and sequenced and the amino acid sequences for the spinach and maize enzymes have been deduced from these gene sequences [244,245]. It should be pointed out that these sequences are for the 63 kDa subunit and, in fact, no genetic evidence has yet been obtained for the existence of the small subunit as an intrinsic constituent of any ferredoxin-dependent nitrite reductase. Transcription of both the spinach [244] and maize [245] genes, and also of the genes coding for nitrite reductase in wheat [224], pea [246,247] and barley [248] depends on the presence of nitrate. Light appears to further stimulate gene ex-

V-B.3. Nitrite binding A large body of evidence has been obtained identifying the siroheme group of the enzyme as the site of nitrite binding. Addition of nitrite [209,211,215,218, 232,234,236] or of other ligands that act as inhibitors of the enzyme and are known to bind to hemes (e.g., cyanide [210,218,232,236] or CO [218]) results in perturbation of the siroheme optical absorbance spectrum. Addition of nitrite [218,225,232,236,249,250] or cyanide [210,218,232,236] to the oxidized enzyme eliminates or substantially diminishes the EPR signals characteristic of high-spin ferric heme. Features characteristic of lowspin, six-coordinate heme have been observed in the EPR spectrum of the cyanide complex of nitrite reductase [232]. Resonance Raman spectra of the enzyme and of its cyanide complex are also consistent with the conclusion that binding of this ligand produces a transition from high-spin to low-spin heme [251]. EPR investigations of the enzyme/nitrite complex have failed to detect any low-spin signals that can be unambiguously attributed to this complex (see Refs. 249 and 250 for a detailed discussion of this phenomenon). Features indicating the presence of a small amount of low-spin siroheme have been observed in the EPR spectrum of the resting spinach and barley enzymes [225,232,249]. There is a recent report that addition of nitrite to the barley enzyme resulted in a broadening of this low-spin, minor species [225] but this phenomenon was not observed with the spinach enzyme [249]. Nitrite reductase can also bind NO and the NO/fer-

113 rous siroheme adduct has been detected by observation of its characteristic EPR signal [210,211,225,231,234, 236,252]. Analysis of differences in the hyperfine structure observed in the EPR spectra of the laNO and 15NO ferrous siroheme/adducts for the enzyme confirms that siroheme is the binding site for this ligand [225,252]. Quantitation of the EPR signal arising from the NO complex indicates that 1 mole of NO can be bound per mole of siroheme [231]. Nitrite reductase also binds hydroxylamine, which can be reduced by the enzyme and has been proposed as a possible intermediate formed during the reduction of nitrite to ammonia [210,218]. Perturbation of the optical absorbance spectrum of the enzyme indicates that the siroheme provides the binding site for this ligand [210,218]. Perturbations in the optical and EPR spectra of the enzyme by sulfite, which like nitrite can undergo a six-electron reduction catalyzed by the enzyme, support the conclusion that this ligand also binds to the siroheme group of nitrite reductase [210,218,249]. The high-spin EPR signal observed with the oxidized, resting enzyme has been quantitated and accounts for most of the siroheme present in the enzyme [232,249]. Although the resonance Raman spectrum of the resting enzyme has been interpreted in terms of six-coordinate, high-spin siroheme [251], the EPR spectrum of resting nitrite reductase is equally consistent with the siroheme iron either being five-coordinate or being coordinated to a weakly bound sixth ligand. Interpretation of the resonance Rarnan spectra of nitrite reductase is somewhat difficult because of the lack of Raman data for model siroheme compounds of unambiguously known spin states [251]. In the case of the siroheme in the structurally similar E. coli sulfite reductase, the siroheme iron has been shown by ENDOR spectroscopy to be five-coordinate [253]. If the siroheme iron in chloroplast nitrite reductases is five-coordinate or contains a weakly bound sixth axial ligand, binding of nitrite to this site should be facile. Binding of nitrite would be further facilitated if, as appears to be the case in the E. coli sulfite reductase [243], the siroheme is located close to the surface of the protein and the vacant sixth coordination position on iron is freely accessible to the solvent. Equilibrium dialysis measurements [231,232] and titrations of the spectral perturbations caused by the addition of nitrite [215] indicate a 1 : 1 ratio between the number of binding sites for nitrite on spinach nitrite reductase and the siroheme content of the enzyme. The spectral perturbations that result from nitrite binding to oxidized nitrite reductase have been used to quantitatively measure the binding affinity of the spinach enzyme for this substrate [215,232,254]. The binding data reported by Mikami and Ida could be fitted to an equation describing a single binding isotherm with K a = 10/~M [215], identical within the experimental uncertainties to the 11/~M value reported earlier by Hirasawa et al. [254]. The 10/~M value reported by Mikami and Ida for K d was identical to the 10 #M value observed as the g m value for nitrite in kinetic assays with reduced ferredoxin serving as the electron donor [215]. Of interest is the oservation that the apparent K m for nitrite depends on the electron donor used during the assay, with the value being considerably higher, 110/~M, when reduced ferredoxin was replaced by reduced methyl viologen [214,215]. This effect of electron donor on the K m for the reducible substrate suggests the possibility that the separate binding sites for nitrite and ferredoxin may exhibit cooperativity, as is the case for the two substrate-binding sites in FNR (see above). Measurements of the effect of nitrite on the affinity of nitrite reductase for ferredoxin [213] also support the idea of cooperativity between the two substrate-binding sites on the enzyme (see below). A series of measurements in our laboratory, made on the heterodimeric preparation of the enzyme, indicated that binding of both nitrite and cyanide showed cooperativity, with Hill coefficients of 1.6-1.8 and 2.3-2.8, respectively, observed for the binding of the two ligands [232]. Plots of enzyme activity versus nitrite concentration were sigmoidal, with a Hill coefficient of 2.4 [232]. These data were interpreted in terms of cooperativity in nitrite binding between two siroheme groups [232]. However, more recent N-terminal amino acid analyses of the heterodimeric preparation indicate that heterogeneity in the enzyme preparation may provide an alterative explanation for non-hyperbolic kinetic and binding profiles (Hilliard, N., Hirasawa, M., Knaff, D.B. and Shaw, R.W., unpublished observations). Nitrite binding to the enzyme may cause conformational changes in the enzyme, as suggested by changes produced in the CD spectrum that accompany nitrite binding to the enzyme. These changes occur both in the visible region [255], where they presumably reflect changes in the environment of the siroheme, and in the ultraviolet region (Hirasawa, M. and Knaff, D.B., unpublished observations). In the latter case, the changes in the CD that occur on nitrite binding presumably reflect changes in the secondary structure of the enzyme. The presence of relatively low concentrations of nitrite specifically protects the enzyme from denaturation at low ionic strength [256], an observation that is also consistent with the occurrence of nitrite-induced conformational changes in the enzyme. Nitrite binding also causes changes in absorbance in the region from 250 to 300 nm [232,254], indicating the substrate binding to nitrite reductase may perturb the environement of one or more aromatic amino acids. V-B. 4. Ferredoxin binding The first evidence supporting electrostatically stabilized complex formation between ferredoxin and nitrite

114 reductase came from observations that the spinach enzyme could bind to a ferredoxin-Sepahrose affinity column at low ionic strength and could be eluted from the affinity column at high ionic strength [209,211,213,214, 257-259]. Investigations in our laboratory and in that of Kamin initially suggested that the monomeric, 63 kDa form of the enzyme could not bind to a ferredoxin-Sepharose affinity column [213,260], while the heterodimeric preparation of the enzyme [213] and the 24 kDa subunit itself [213] did bind to the affinity column. These results, and the observation that loss of the small subunit from either spinach or C. reinhardtii nitrite reductase specifically inhibited the ferredoxin-dependent activity of the enzymes with little effect on the methyl viologen-dependent activity [211,213,216,217], lead to the proposal that the small subunit of nitrite reductase contained the major binding site for ferredoxin bound on the enzyme. Although reconstitution experiments designed to increase the rate of ferredoxindependent reduction of nitrite by adding the small subunit to the prosthetic group-containing large subunit proved unsuccessful (Hirasawa, M. and Knaff, D.B., unpublished observations), additional support for the hypothesis that the 24 kDa subunit contained a ferredoxin-binding site came from spectral perturbation measurements showing that the small subunit could bind ferredoxin at low ionic strength with Ka = 4.4/~M [2131. In recent years it has become clear that 61 to 63 kDa, monomeric forms of nitrite reductase, prepared from a number of different higher plants, exhibit high activity with ferredoxin serving as the electron donor and bind to ferredoxin-Sepharose affinity columns [214,215,224, 225,238,256,261]. Furthermore, spectral perturbation measurements in our laboratory showed that, although removing the small subunit resulted in a decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for ferredoxin (K d increased from 0.63 to 11 /~M), the large subunit is capable of binding ferredoxin [217]. It was thus proposed that, while optimum ferredoxin binding requires the presence of the small subunit, at least a portion of the ferredoxin-binding site resides on the large subunit [217]. Additional evidence for the presence of a ferredoxinbinding site on the large subunit came from observations that ferredoxin protects a monomeric form of the enzyme against denaturation at low ionic strengths with an apparent K d of 1 /LM and that ferredoxin can be cross-linked to monomeric nitrite reductase in the presence of EDC [256]. It must be mentioned that three recent preparations of nitrite reductase in our laboratory, using protocols that had previously resulted in unambiguously dimeric preparations of the enzyme, produced a monomeric, 63 kDa form of the enzyme with high ferredoxin-dependent activity. No evidence for the presence of the 24 kDa subunit was found in the final purification stages of these preparations (Hilliard, N., Hirasawa, M., Knaff, D.B. and Shaw, R.W., unpublished observations). The arguments for the existence of a second nitrite reductase subunit, involved in ferredoxin binding, are thus currently under critical reexamination in our laboratory. Additional evidence for electrostatic complex formation between ferredoxin and nitrite reductase has been obtained from the observation that the two proteins co-migrate during gel-filtration chromatography at low ionic strength but not at high ionic strength [262]. Alterations in the CD spectra also have been observed on mixing of the two proteins at low but not high ionic strength (Ref. 255, Hirasawa, M. and Knaff, D.B., unpublished observations). Perturbations of absorbance spectra in the visible region have been observed on addition of ferredoxin to both heterodimeric [213] and monomeric [215] preparations of the spinach enzyme, providing further evidence for complex formation between the two proteins. Although the difference spectra reported for ferredoxin binding to spinach nitrite reductase were different for the two different preparations of the enzyme, similar K d values, 0.63/~M [213] and 1.0 /~M [215], for ferredoxin were obtained in these studies. The fact that these spectral perturbations were observed only at low ionic strength [213,215], provides additional support for electrostatic stabilization of the complex. Spectral perturbation measurements have also been utilized to demonstrate formation of a ternary complex between the enzyme, nitrite and ferredoxin, establishing unequivocally that the enzyme contains distinct binding sites for its two substrates [213]. As in the case of FNR, there appears to be negative cooperativity between the two sites, with the K a for ferredoxin binding increasing from 0.63/~M for nitrite reductase alone to 11/~m for the enzyme/nitrite complex [213]. As mentioneM above, chemical modification of three or four carboxyl groups on ferredoxin to remove the negative charges leads to a decreased affinity of ferredoxin for FNR. A similar effect of modification of ferredoxin carboxyl groups has been observed for the interaction of ferredoxin with nitrite reductase [262]. The K d determined for binding the modified ferredoxin to spinach nitrite reductase was considerably larger, 100 #M, than that determined for unmodified, native ferredoxin [262]. Modification of ferredoxin carboxyl groups by EDC, after ferredoxin lysine groups were first methylated by treatment with dimethylamine borane to prevent EDC-induced dimerization of ferredoxin, also resulted in a decreased affinity of ferredoxin for spinach nitrite reductase [256]. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that ferredoxin may have a common binding site, defined by a group of negatively charged amino acids, for a number of ferredoxin-dependent enzymes [262]. Additional evidence in support of this hypothesis, in so far as FNR and nitrite reductase are concerned, has been obtained from both cross-linking

115 [2561 and immunological [263] experiments. Cross-linking studies in which EDC was added to mixtures of ferredoxin, nitrite reductase and FNR produced no ternary cross-linked complexes, but instead resulted only in formation of binary complexes with ferredoxin cross-linked to either FNR or to nitrite reductase [256]. The apparent competition observed in the cross linking experiments (i.e., the amount of FNR cross-linked to ferredoxin decreased as the amount of nitrite reductase present was increased and vice versa) are consistent with a common binding site, or overlapping binding sites, for the two enzymes on ferredoxin [256]. In the immunological studies, it was shown that antibodies raised in either rabbit or mouse against spinach FNR recognized spinach nitrite reductase, demonstrating that these two chloroplast, ferredoxin-dependent enzymes have at least one antigenic determinant in common [263]. The observation that the antibodies against FNR inhibited the enzymatic activity of nitrite reductase to a much greater extent when reduced ferredoxin served as the electron donor than when reduced methyl viologen supplied electrons suggests that the common antigenic determinants are at the ferredoxin-binding sites of the two enzymes [263]. Evidence will be presented below that the ferredoxin-binding site of a third chloroplast, ferredoxin-dependent enzyme, glutamate synthase, contains a ferredoxin-binding site that is structurally related to those of FNR and nitrite reductase.
V-C. Glutamate synthase

tent [279,280]. This developmental pattern, which has also been observed in barley [281], suggests that a regulatory relationship exists between expression of the gene coding for ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase and the presence of the photochemical apparatus needed to generate the photoreduced ferredoxin required for the enzyme to function. Recent immunocytochemical studies on tomato [282] have confirmed earlier data from cell fractionation studies [268,279,279a,b] which indicated that ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase is localized in the chloroplast, as might be expected in view of the localization of ferredoxin in this organelle. Spinach and C. reinhardtii glutamate synthases, both of which have been purified to homogeneity, are the best characterized of these ferredoxin-dependent enzymes in terms of what is known about their ability to interact with ferredoxin. The remaining portion of this section will thus concentrate on these two glutamate synthases.
V-CA. Peptide composition and prosthetic group content Both the spinach and C. reinhardtii enzymes are monomeric proteins. The molecular mass of the C. reinhardtii enzyme was estimated as 144 kDa from a combination of Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient data, estimated as 144.5 kDa from electrophoresis data under non-denaturing conditions and as 151 kDa from electrophoresis data obtained under denaturing conditions [278]. The molecular mass of the spinach enzyme was estimated to b 140 kDa from gel-filtration data and to be between 150 and 170 kDa from electrophoresis data obtained under denaturing conditions [273,286]. Molecular masses between 145 and 180 kDa have been estimated for the bean [270] and corn [271] enzymes. Recent Western blot experiments in our laboratory, using a monospecific antibody raised against spinach glutamate synthase, indicate that the pea enzyme is antigenically related to the spinach enzyme and has a very similar molecular mass (Hirasawa, M., Nalbantoglu, B., Nguyen, H. and Knaff, D.B., unpublished observations). In contrast, rice glutamate synthase was reported to have a molecular mass of 224 kDa and to be composed of two possibly identical subunits with 115 kDa [274]. Antibodies raised against the C. reinhardtii enzyme were effective in inhibiting both the ferredoxin-dependent and methyl viologen-dependent activities of extracts from a number of green algae but had little effect on extracts prepared from spinach and other higher plants or from cyanobacteria [283]. This observation indicates that, although C. reinhardtii and spinach glutamate synthases may resemble each other in some ways (see below), enough differences are present between the two enzymes to render them antigenically distinct. Spectra of spinach and C. reinhardtii glutamate synthases established that they are both flavin-containing

Ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (EC 1.4.7.1), which catalyzes the following reaction:
glutamine + 2-oxoglutarate + 2ferredoxin Red

---,2glutamate+ 2ferredoxinOx is located in the chloroplasts of higher plants and algae and differs from the NADH-dependent enzyme (EC 1.4.1.14), which is known to be present in some nongreen plant tissues [264,265]. There are also early reports of glutamate synthases in pea roots [266] and developing soybean cotyledons [267] that could utilize either NADH or reduced ferredoxin as electron donors. Ferredoxin-dependent forms of the enzyme have been identified in a number of higher plants including pea [268,269], field bean [270], corn [271], spinach [272,273], rice [274,275] and tomato [276,277]. The enzyme has also been isolated from the green alga C. reinhardtii [278]. Both the NADH-dependent and the ferredoxindependent enzyme were found to be present in etiolated pea shoots [269]. During greening of the pea shoots, the amount of NADH-dependent enzyme remained constant, while the amount of ferredoxin-dependent enzyme increased along with increasing chlorophyll con-

116 enzymes [273,278]. Chemical analyses indicate that both enzymes contain one FAD and one FMN [273,284]. Both enzymes also contain non-heme iron and inorganic sulfide, suggesting the presence of one or more ironsulfur clusters. Analysis of the C. reinhardtii enzyme yielded values of 3 mol of iron and 4 mol of sulfide per mol of enzyme [284], while values of 4 mol of iron and 4 mol of sulfide per mol of enzyme were reported for spinach glutamate synthase [273]. No EPR signals were observed at 6 K with samples of the C. reinhardtii enzyme that had been preincubated under strongly reducing conditions [284], conditions under which both [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters should be reduced and would be expected to exhibit EPR signals. From this observation and the iron content of the enzyme, it was concluded that C. reinhardtii glutamate synthase probably contains a [3Fe-xS] cluster [284]. However, although the oxidized forms of [3Fe-xS] clusters are known to exhibit characteristic, relatively sharp EPR signals [285], no such signals were observed with samples of the C. reinhardtii enzyme [284]. As there are a number of reasons why EPR signals from [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters present in the enzyme might not have been observed, it would seem prudent to reserve judgement as to the nature of the iron-sulfur cluster(s) in C. reinhardtii glutamate synthase until additional spectroscopic evidence is obtained. EPR measurements have not yet been performed on spinach glutamate synthase, but circular dichroism measurements were consistent with the presence of two [2Fe-2S] clusters in the spinach enzyme [263]. However, as circular dichroism spectra do not allow unambiguous identification of iron-sulfur clusters, additional spectroscopic measurements must be conducted before any firm conclusions can be drawn as to the nature of the iron-sulfur cluster(s) in the spinach enzyme. No information is yet available about E m values for any of the prosthetic groups in either the spinach or C. reinhardtii enzyme. It should be pointed out that the rice leaf enzyme contains neither flavin nor non-heine iron, nor inorganic sulfide [274]. Thus the rice enzyme differs from other leaf glutamate synthases in terms of prosthetic group content as well as subunit composition.
V-C.2. Ferredoxin binding Complex formation between spinach glutamate synthase and ferredoxin at low ionic strength has been demonstrated by spectral perturbation measurements [262], co-chromatography during gel filtration [262], changes in circular dichroism spectra [263] and crosslinking [263,286]. No evidence for interaction between the two proteins could be observed at high ionic strengths. The ionic strength dependence of the interaction between spinach glutamate synthase and ferredoxin suggests that the glutamate synthase/ferredoxin complex, like those between ferredoxin and FNR or nitrite

reductase, is stabilized by electrostatic forces. Titrations of the absorbance changes [2621 and CD changes [2631 caused by adding ferredoxin to glutamate synthase produced data that fit single binding isotherms with K a values of 9 /~M and 14.5 /~M, respectively. These two values for K d agree to within the experimental uncertainties present in the measurements. Membrane ultrafiltration binding assays [263] and cross-linking data [286] suggest that the ferredoxin to glutamate synthase stoichiometry in the complex is 2 : 1. Modification of 3 to 4 carboxyl groups on spinach ferredoxin, a treatment that decreased the ability of ferredoxin to bind both FNR and nitrite reductase (see above), also decreased the ability of ferrodoxin to bind glutamate synthase [262]. Titrations of optical spectral perturbations indicated that this modification of ferredoxin increased the K d for binding by glutamate synthase from 14.5/LM to 100 /~M [262]. Modification of ferredoxin carboxyl groups also increased the K m for ferredoxin from 2 ~M to 84 ~M [262]. These observations suggest that ferredoxin supplies the negatively charged groups involved in complex formation with spinach glutamate synthase. Furthermore, the similar effects of ferredoxin modification on its ability to bind to FNR, nitrite reductase and glutamate synthase are consistent with the hypothesis that ferredoxin has a common, negatively-charged binding site for all three of these chloroplast enzymes. Additional evidence for similar modes of interaction between ferredoxin and these three ferredoxin-dependent, chloroplast enzymes comes from the observation that rabbit and mouse antibodies against spinach FNR can also recognize spinach nitrite reductase (see above) and glutamate synthase [263]. As is the case for nitrite reductase, the antibody raised against FNR inhibits glutamate synthase to a considerable greater extent if reduced ferredoxin serves as the electron donor than if reduced methyl viologen serves as the source of electrons [263]. These observations have been interpreted in terms of antigenicalty related determinants at the ferredoxin-binding sites of all three enzymes [263]. In the case of spinach glutamate synthase, evidence in support of this hypothesis comes from recent observations on the enzymatically active, EDC cross-linked complex between ferredoxin and glutamate synthase. Although antibodies raised against FNR recognize glutamate synthase itself, they were unable to recognize the crosslinked complex, implying that when ferredoxin binds to glutamate synthase the site on glutamate synthase recognized by the antibody against FNR is no longer accessible to the antibody [286]. Ferredoxin-binding studies have not yet been carried out with C. reinhardtii glutamate synthase. However, the observation that this enzyme binds to a ferredoxinSepharose affinity column at low ionic strength and is eluted at high ionic strength [278] provides evidence for electrostatic interaction between the two proteins. Im-

117 munological experiments indicate that glutamate synthase and nitrite reductase isolated from this green alga have at least one antigenically similar determinant in common [283,287]. Antibody raised against C reinhardtii glutamate synthase was much more effective in inhibiting the reaction catalyzed by C. reinhardtii nitrite reductase when reduced ferredoxin served as the electron donor than when reduced methyl viologen served as the electron donor [287]. Furthermore, ferredoxin was able to protect C. reinhardtii nitrite reductase against immunoprecipitation by antibodies raised against glutamate synthase [287]. These observations, taken together, are most readily interpreted in terms of the antigenically similar determinants on the two C. reinhardtii, ferredoxin-dependent enzymes being located at the ferredoxin-binding sites [287].
VI. Ferredoxin: thioredoxin reductase

In recent years it has become clear that a number of reactions in metabolic pathways that are localized in chloroplasts are regulated through changes in the oxidation state of regulatory dithiol/disulfide groups on chloroplast enzymes [288-290]. These reactions are mediated by thioredoxin, which is reduced in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase (hereafter abbreviated FTR), utilizing reduced ferredoxin as the electron donor. Thioredoxin subsequently reduces a disulfide to two cysteine thiols on the regulated enzymes (Fig. 13). Thioredoxins are lowmolecular-weight proteins that exist in two oxidation states that differ only by the presence of a disulfide (cystine) in oxidized thioredoxin instead of a dithiol (two cysteines) in reduced thioredoxin [291-293]. Thioredoxins play a number of roles in non-photosynthetic organisms, for example serving as a reductant in the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleofides and as a subunit of a phage DNA polymerase [291-293]. A description of these functions of thioredoxins lies outside the scope of this article, but interested readers should consult Refs. 291-293 for excellent reviews. In photosynthetic organisms, thioredoxins carry out many of the same functions as in non-photosynthetic organisms and also serve as a key component in the
/SH /S ~ / S H

regulation of carbon metabolism and of the chloroplast CF1 ATP synthase. The discussion of plant thioredoxins presented below will be confined to these regulatory functions. The discussion of thioredoxin reduction will be confined to the reactions that lead from reduced ferredoxin to thioredoxin via FTR and will not deal with the cytosolic system in which thioredoxin h is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by a 68 kDa flavoprotein reductase [294]. As might be expected, the thioredoxins involved in the activation of chloroplast enzymes, thioredoxins f and m, appear to be localized in the chloroplast [295]. In the case of spinach thioredoxin f, it has been established that the protein is coded for by a nuclear gene and is synthesized as a precursor larger than the mature protein [296]. It has been established that the N-terminal leader sequence of this thioredoxin is subsequently cleaved after passage across the chloroplast envelope, but there is some uncertainty as to the exact location of the cleavage site [296]. Before describing what is known about FTR and its interaction with ferredoxin, brief descriptions of the properties of thioredoxins and the regulatory sites on their target enzymes will be presented.

Two different types of thioredoxin are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants and algae and are classified as either m- or f-type thioredoxins on the basis of their preferential ability to activate either NADP+-de pendent malate dehydrogenase or fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase, respectively [288]. Thioredoxin f is capable of an extremely rapid activation of fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase and is also capable of activating NADP+-de pendent malate dehydrogenase. Thioredoxin m effectively activates malate dehydrogenase but cannot activate fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase [295]. Amino acid sequences have been determined for both thioredoxin f [296] and thioredoxin mb [297] from spinach and for a thioredoxin m from C. reinhardtii [298]. The m-type thioredoxins from these two photosynthetic eukaryotes exhibit considerable sequence homology with thioredoxins from cyanobacteria [297,298]. The amino acid sequence of spinach thioredoxin f is, surprisingly, more closely related to mammalian and avian thioredoxins than to those of m-type thioredoxins from photosynthetic organisms [296]. Spinach and C. reinhardtii m-type thioredoxins exhibit 47% and 41% sequence homology, respectively, with E. coli thioredoxin [297,298]. Spinach thioredoxin f shows considerably less sequence homology, 24%, with the E. coli protein, but does contain the well-conserved active site sequence (... Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys...) found in E. coli thioredoxin and in the m-type thioredoxins [296]. Both spinach thioredoxins m and f can effectively replace E. coli thioredoxin in producing an active phage T7 DNA

118 polymerase [299]. E. coli thioredoxin can replace spinach thioredoxin m in activating NADP+-dependent malate dehydrogenase but cannot replace spinach ferredoxin thioredoxin f as an activator for fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase [300,301]. The results of these activity studies indicate that there are likely to be both significant similarities and differences in the structures of the two spinach thioredoxins and that of E. coli thioredoxin. A 0.28 nm resolution X-ray structure of oxidized E. coli thioredoxin has been available for some time [302] and recently the structure has been refined to 0.17 nm resolution [303]. The region around the active site disulfide forms a protrusion on the surface of the protein. There are several hydrophobic residues in the vicinity of the disulfide bond of E. coli thioredoxin that have been implicated in the interaction of thioredoxin with other proteins [304]. This conserved hydrophobic 'patch' is also present in spinach thioredoxin f [296]. However, it may not be involved in the interaction between thioredoxin f and its target enzyme, fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase, as E. coli thioredoxin cannot substitute for thioredoxin f in activating this enzyme (see above). N o structural information on reduced E. coli thioredoxin is available from X-ray diffraction studies, but N M R studies indicate that the overall structures of the oxidized and reduced proteins are quite similar [305307]. There are, however, significant local conformational changes in the region near the active site [305307]. The availability of an increasing number of thioredoxin sequences, of structural data from N M R studies on thioredoxins other than the E. coil protein [308] and of information from reactivity studies with hybrid thioredoxins [309] and with thioredoxin mutants [310] constructed by site-directed mutagenesis should lead to rapid progress in our understanding of how thioredoxins interact with other proteins.
VI-B. Reduction o f target enzymes

thioredoxin appears to involve complex formation between the proteins [321-323]. Amino acid sequences are now available for the regulatory sites of three soluble, chloroplast enzymes: fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase [312, 323a], NADP+-dependent malate dehydrogenase [311] and phosphoribulokinase [324]. In the case of the first two enzymes, the regulatory site is separated from the active site [318,323], while in the case of phosphoribulokinase, one of the regulatory cysteines is also part of the active site [318,324,325]. The regulatory cysteines on the chloroplast CF 1 ATP synthase [326] have also been identified [327,328].
VI-C. F T R subunit and prosthetic group content

In vitro studies with purified components have established that the activation of chloroplast enzymes by reduced thioredoxin involves the reduction of one regulatory disulfide bond per subunit on each enzyme, with the concomitant oxidation of reduced thioredoxin [311-317]. Recent experiments using a membrane-permeable, thiol-labeling reagent have established that a similar series of events occur in intact chloroplasts [318]. There have been relatively few determinations of the E m values of these sulfhydryl groups, but those for the active site dithiol/disulfide in corn thioredoxin m and corn NADP+-dependent malate dehydrogenase have been estimated to be - 300 and - 330 mV, respectively [319]. An early estimate of the E m value for yeast thioredoxin yielded a more positive value, - 2 4 0 mV, than that reported for corn thioredoxin [320]. The reduction of at least some of the target enzymes by

F T R has been purified to homogeneity from spinach, corn and the cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum [329]. In all three cases, the enzyme has a molecular mass of approx. 30 kDa and is composed of two different kinds of subunit [329]. In terms of molecular mass and antigenic properties, one of the subunits, of 13 kDa, appears to be similar in all three enzymes, while the second subunit (16, 15 and 7 kDa in spinach, corn and N. muscorum, respectively) is more variable [329]. The amino acid compositions and N-terminal amino acid sequences of spinach F T R have recently been determined [329a]. The catalytically active disulfide, which becomes reduced to two cysteine thiols when the enzyme reacts with reduced ferredoxin, is located on the similar, 13 kDa subunit [318,329,330]. These two cysteines on the 13 kDa subunit become reoxidized to a disulfide when F T R reduces thioredoxin [318,330]. F T R contains 4 non-heme iron and 4 inorganic sulfides and the absorbance spectra of the spinach, corn, and N. muscorum proteins are all consistent with the presence of at least one iron-sulfur cluster [329]. It is likely that F T R is identical to the protein earlier called 'ferralterin' [329]. If this is the case, studies with ferralterin had previously established that the iron-sulfur cluster of the protein is EPR-silent under reducing conditions and exhibits a rhombic EPR signal at low temperatures (g values of 2.10, 2.05 and 2.00 and 2.09, 2.04 and 1.98 were observed for the spinach and N. muscorum proteins, respectively) when the protein is oxidized [331]. A value of + 410 mV was estimated for the E m of the N. muscorum enzyme [331]. These results are consistent with the cluster being either a 'HiPIPtype' [4Fe-4S] or a [3Fe-xS] duster [285]. Circular dichroism spectra of spinach F T R are most consistent with the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster of the [4Fe-4S] type [332], but additional spectroscopic measurements will be required before the nature of the iron-sulfur cluster can be decided unambiguously. Although it has been demonstrated that the iron-sulfur cluster in F T R can be photoreduced by illuminated chloroplast membranes [331], the role of this cluster in the reaction catalyzed by FI~R is unclear.

VI-D. Ferredoxin binding
Although few details are known about the interaction of F TR and thioredoxin, a picture is beginning to emerge of how FTR interacts with its other substrate, ferredoxin. Early studies suggested that FTR could form a tight complex with ferredoxin (see Ref. 329 for a discussion of these observations) and it was known that the enzyme would bind to a ferredoxin-Sepharose affinity column at low ionic strength and could be eluted from the affinity column at high ionic strength [333]. Recently, complex formation between spinach FTR and ferredoxin at low ionic strength has been demonstrated directly by monitoring the perturbations in both absorbance and circular dichroism spectra that occur when the two proteins are mixed and by co-chromatography of the two proteins during gel-filtration chromatography [332]. No evidence for any interactions between FFR and ferredoxin could be observed at high ionic strength [332]. Thus, as in the cases of ferredoxin complexes with FNR, nitrite reductase and glutamate synthase, the FTR/ferredoxin complex appears to be stabilized by electrostatic forces. The apparent molecular mass of the complex, as estimated by gel-filtration chromatography, and titrations of the spectral perturbations caused by adding ferredoxin to FTR, suggest that the stoichiometry of ferredoxin to FTR in the complex is 1 : 1 [332]. The binding between the two proteins at low ionic strength was so tight that an accurate value for K d could not be determined, but an upper limit of 100 nM was estimated [332]. Chemical modification of three or four carboxyl residues on ferredoxin had no measurable effect on either the binding of ferredoxin to FTR or on the K m of the enzyme for ferredoxin [332]. A 30% decrease in the maximum velocity of the reaction was observed when modified ferredoxin replaced native ferredoxin in an assay system coupling FTR to spinach thioredoxin m and corn NADP+-dependent malate dehydrogenase [332]. This is in striking contrast to the effects of this modification of ferredoxin on its ability to interact with FNR, nitrite reductase and glutamate synthase (see above). The absence of any detectable effect of this ferredoxin modification on the FTR/ferredoxin complex may result from the presence of an interaction site on ferredoxin for FTR that differs from the putative, common interaction site for FNR, nitrite reductase and glutamate synthase. Alternatively, the binding between FTR and ferredoxin may be so tight that the effect of decreases in binding affinity resulting from the modification of ferredoxin are too small to detect.

been made in recent years in elucidating the mechanism by which ferredoxin becomes photoreduced during oxygenic photosynthesis and how the reduced ferredoxin is productively reoxidized by a number of ferredoxin-dependent enzymes. Fig. 14 summarizes the central role of ferredoxin in distributing electrons derived from the photosynthetic oxidation of water to several of these enzymes. The limitations of space were such that this artide could not discuss all of the ferredoxin-dependent enzymes that have been investigated. It should be mentioned that for sulfite reductase, one of the chloroplast enzymes shown in Fig. 14 but not discussed in this review, evidence has been obtained for electrostatic complex formation between ferredoxin and this ferredoxin-dependent enzyme [334]. The cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum contains a novel, ferredoxin-dependent nitrate reductase [335] and there is some evidence from affinity chromatography that suggests that cyanobacterial nitrate reductases may form complexes with ferredoxin [336]. Newly discovered, ferredoxin-dependent enzymes, such as a spinach choline monooxygenase [337], have yet to be investigated in terms of their capacity to interact with ferredoxin. The opportunity to characterize ferredoxin binding by these enzymes and the availability of tools to characterize in detail the ferredoxin-binding sites of the enzymes discussed in this review would appear to make the immediate future in this area of research truly exciting.
