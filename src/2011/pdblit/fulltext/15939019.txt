Max-Planck-Institut fur ¨ molekulare Physiologie Abteilung physikalische Biochemie, Rheinlanddamm 201, D-44139 Dortmund Germany The interaction of the nucleotide-free molecular chaperone DnaK (Hsp70) from Escherichia coli with nucleotides was studied under equilibrium and transient kinetic conditions. These studies used the intrinsic fluorescence signal of the single tryptophan residue (Trp102) of DnaK, or of novel fluorescent nucleotide analogs of ADP and ATP, N8-(4-N'-methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine 5'-di- or triphosphate (MABAADP and MABA-ATP) as spectroscopic probes. Titration of MABA-ADP with DnaK resulted in a 2.3-fold increase of the fluorescence signal, from which a binding stoichiometry of 1:1, and a dissociation constant (Kd ) of 0.09 mM were derived. The intrinsic rate constant of hydrolysis of ATP or MABA-ATP in single turnover experiments was found to be 1.5 × 10-3 s-1 and 1.6 × 10-3 s-1, identical with the catalytic rate constant of 1.5(20.17) × 10-3 s-1 obtained under steady-state conditions. The dissociation rate constant of ADP was measured to be 35(27) × 10-3 s-1 in the absence or 15(2 5) × 10-3 s-1 in the presence of 2 mM inorganic phosphate (Pi ) and is therefore 10 to 20 times faster than the rate of hydrolysis. These results demonstrated that processes governing ATP hydrolysis are rate-limiting in the DnaK ATPase reaction cycle. The three observed different fluorescent states of the single tryptophan residue were investigated. The binding of ATP gave a decrease of 15% in fluorescence intensity compared with the nucleotide-free state. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis, or the simultaneous addition of ADP and Pi , increased the fluorescence 7% above the fluorescence intensity of the nucleotide-free protein. Changes in the tryptophan fluorescence could not be detected when ADP, Pi or the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analogs AMPPNP (Kd = 1.62(20.1) mM) or ATPgS (Kd = 0.044(20.003) mM) were added. These data suggested that DnaK exists in at least three different conformational states, depending on nucleotide site occupancy. The fluorescence increase of DnaK upon ATP binding was resolved into two steps; a rapid first step (Kd 1 = 7.3 mM) is followed by a second slow step (k + 2 = 1.5 s-1 and k-2 E 1.5 × 10-3 s-1) that causes the decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence signal. The addition of ATP also resulted in the release of DnaK-bound peptide substrate with koff = 3.8 s-1, comparable with the rate of the second step of nucleotide binding. AMPPNP or ATPgS were not able to change the fluorescence signal nor to release the peptide. We therefore conclude that the second step of ATP binding, and not the 1000-fold slower ATP hydrolysis is coupled to peptide release.

ATP Binding to DnaK Induces Peptide Release

Introduction
The molecular chaperone DnaK from Escherichia coli belongs to one of the major classes of heat-shock proteins and their constitutive cognates (hsp and hsc) named hsp70s and hsc70s according to their molecular mass of 70 kDa. This class of proteins has the interesting property of preventing denatured or partially folded proteins from aggregation and thus irreversible denaturation (Gething & Sambrook, 1992; Hendrick & Hartl, 1993). These partially folded proteins are specifically recognized and bound by DnaK. Release is induced by ATP to allow for further cycles of refolding (Palleros et al., 1993, 1994; Schroder et al., 1993). ¨ DnaK hydrolyses ATP to give the products ADP and Pi, an activity that is an essential property of the two most prominent classes of molecular chaperones, hsc60 and hsc70 (GroEL and DnaK in E. coli; McKay et al., 1994). The ATPase activity of hsp70 proteins is thought to be crucial for their biological function (Gething & Sambrook, 1992; Hartl et al., 1992; Ang et al., 1991; Craig et al., 1993). Mutations of DnaK that prevent the ATP-induced substrate release are also unable to assist protein folding (Buchberger et al., 1994). In contrast to initial studies that favored the ATPase reaction of hsp70 proteins to be coupled to peptide release (Sadis & Hightower, 1992), there is growing evidence that the mere binding of ATP is responsible for the release of peptide (Palleros et al., 1993; Schmid et al., 1994; McCarty et al., 1995). The ATPase activity of DnaK is regulated by the so-called cohort proteins GrpE and DnaJ. GrpE acts as a nucleotide exchange factor and DnaJ stimulates the ATPase reaction (Liberek et al., 1991; Szabo et al., 1994; McCarty et al., 1995). The hsp70 proteins are composed of a highly conserved N-terminal part that comprises the ATPase activity (ATPase domain) and a less conserved C-terminal peptide-binding domain (Chappell et al., 1987; Montgomery et al., 1993; Gragerov et al., 1994). The three-dimensional structure of the ATPase domain (residues 1 to 386) of hsc70, the bovine member of the hsp70 family was solved by X-ray crystallography (Flaherty et al., 1990) and the structural basis of its ATP-hydrolyzing activity was presented recently (Wilbanks et al., 1994; Flaherty et al., 1994). We are interested in understanding how the chemical energy that is available upon hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to structural changes of the peptide-binding region that results in the proper folding of a substrate protein. To understand this mechanism it is essential to dissect the individual steps of the ATPase cycle of DnaK. Of particular interest is the step of the overall ATPase reaction that switches the enzyme from a high-affinity to a low-affinity state for peptide binding, since this step is where coupling can be observed between the nucleotide and peptide-binding domains. Two prerequisites for performing such measurements are the availability of nucleotide-free protein to

make nucleotide-binding measurements possible and a spectroscopic probe to allow time-resolved measurements of nucleotide binding and release. We have developed a gentle and efficient enzymatic method to obtain nucleotide free DnaK, and we have synthesized a novel fluorescent nucleotide analog that allows monitoring of nucleotide binding in cases where the intrinsic fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue of DnaK fails to report binding events. The nucleotidefree protein was used for a detailed kinetic analysis of the individual steps of the unstimulated ATPase cycle of DnaK. The results are compared with the corresponding data for hsc70 (Gao et al., 1993, 1994; Ha & McKay, 1994, 1995). Although many steps of the ATPase cycle of these homologous proteins seem to be comparable, there are some important differences in the properties of the different nucleotide-bound states. In addition we addressed the question of which step of the ATPase cycle is responsible for the ATP-induced peptide release. We find that initial binding of ATP is followed by a slow structural change of the DnaK·ATP complex and that this change is correlated to peptide release. Subsequent hydrolysis is 1000-fold slower than this conformational change and thus not responsible for peptide release.

Results and Discussion
Purification of nucleotide free protein A major prerequisite for the study of nucleotide binding to DnaK is the availability of active, nucleotide-free protein. In our hands, dialysis in EDTA-containing buffer for several days failed to produce nucleotide-free protein as observed earlier for hsc70 (Gao et al., 1994). We found the treatment with alkaline phosphatase to give the best results, since it is fast and gentle. According to HPLC analysis (see Materials and Methods) the protein contained at most 1% nucleotide after this treatment. Also proteins that are deficient in ATP hydrolysis and are purified with very tightly bound ATP can be depleted of the nucleotide with this method (H.-P.S. and J.R., unpublished results). Fluorescent nucleotide analog MABA-ADP In order to directly monitor nucleotide binding to DnaK we designed fluorescent ATP/ADP analogs that change fluorescence upon binding to DnaK. We made use of the observation that DnaK can bind to ATP-agarose, where the ATP moiety is coupled chemically at the C8 position via a nonyl-carbon linker to agarose and therefore coupled a fluorescent group to the C8 position of the base via a carbon linker (see Materials and Methods). To test the influence of the spacer length on the binding affinity, spacers with four or nine methylene groups were attached to the fluorescent succinimidyl N-methylanthranylate (SMANT)

group. The synthesis and structural formula of these novel fluorescent nucleotide analogs N8-(4-N'methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine 5'-diphosphate (MABA-ADP) and N8-(4-N'methylanthraniloylaminononyl)-8-aminoadenosine 5'-diphosphate (MANA-ADP) are described in Materials and Methods. Upon addition of nucleotide-free DnaK to MABA-ADP, a significant increase of fluorescence by some 140%, with a concomitant blue shift from 433 nm to 426 nm for the maximum of the emission spectrum occurred. This blue shift is interpreted to represent a change to a more hydrophobic environment of the fluorescent MANT group when attached to the ribose (Hiratsuka, 1983). The maximum of excitation was at 347 nm and is thus not sensitive to inner filter effects caused by the absorption of unmodified nucleotides. Binding stoichiometry of MABA-ADP to DnaK In order to determine the binding stoichiometry of MABA-ADP to DnaK, the experimental conditions for an active-site titration were chosen such that the initial concentration of MABA-ADP of 4.2 mM was some 40 times above the measured dissociation constant of 0.1 mM (data not shown). Under those conditions, the addition of DnaK results in virtually complete binding and the intercepts of the initial phase of binding and the final amplitude indicate that 4.2 mM DnaK was necessary to saturate 4.2 mM MABA-ADP. We therefore conclude the binding stoichiometry to be 1:1. It should be noted that the protein concentration as determined by the Bradford (1976) assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard agreed well with the protein concentration determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (Schonfeld et al., ¨ 1995). A binding stoichiometry of 1:1 was also found for hsc70 and ATP or ADP (Gao et al., 1993, 1994). The affinity of MABA-ADP to DnaK was determined in an equilibrium titration experiment where the initial concentration of MABA-ADP was close to the expected dissociation constant (Figure 1A). The fluorescence of the nucleotide analog MABA-ADP increases by some 130% when saturated with DnaK. The titration data can be described by the quadratic equation (Reinstein et al., 1990), which represents a simple 1:1 binding mechanism and a Kd of 0.09(20.01) mM at 25°C for the interaction of MABA-ADP with DnaK. Displacement of MABA-ADP by ADP is complete at high concentrations of ADP (Figure 1B) and is therefore competitive. The data can be described by a cubic equation, which is the general solution for the competitive displacement of a ligand and has to be used for the conditions that are present in this study (Thrall et al., 1996). The dissociation constant of ADP was calculated to be 0.13 (20.02) mM. Both the fact that the displacement of MABA-ADP is complete and the virtually identical affinities of MABA-ADP and ADP

Figure 1. Binding of MABA-ADP to DnaK (A) and it's displacement by ADP (B). A, The fluorescence of the nucleotide analog MABA-ADP increases by some 130% when saturated with DnaK. The titration data can be described by the quadratic equation, which represents a simple 1:1 binding stoichiometry and a Kd of 0.09(20.01) mM for the interaction of MABA-ADP with DnaK. The line drawn through the data points represents a simulation using the parameters mentioned above. Experimental conditions were: 0.64 mM MABA-ADP in standard buffer at 25°C. The emission wavelength was 440 nm and the excitation wavelength was 360 nm. B, This experiment shows the displacement of MABA-ADP by ADP to be complete and therefore to be purely competitive. The data can be described by a cubic equation, which is the general solution for the competitive displacement of a ligand and has to be used for the conditions that are present in this experiment (see Materials and Methods). The dissociation constant of ADP can thus be calculated to be 0.13(20.02) mM. Experimental conditions were as described above.

indicate that the binding of the fluorophore is highly specific and that the presence of the fluorescent group does not affect the binding mode of the nucleotide. The fluorescent nucleotide analog with a longer nonyl linker (MANA-ADP) has a Kd of 0.15(20.02) mM and variations of the lengths of the linker between four and nine carbon atoms seem not to affect the affinity of the analog, again indicating that the fluorophore might not form specific interactions with the protein. The competitive displacement method described above allowed the measurement of the dissociation constants of various nucleotides that do not cause a change in the intrinsic tryptophan signal of DnaK (see Table 1). The affinity of AMP (Kd = 17.6 mM) is some 135-fold lower than that of ADP (Kd = 0.13 mM), indicating that the b-phosphate group contributes significantly to the affinity of ADP. The purine nucleotide GDP binds with Kd = 90 mM, ca 700-fold weaker than ADP, showing DnaK to be highly specific for adenosine nucleotides. Surprisingly, the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide 5'-adenylyl-b, g-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) binds with Kd = 1.6 mM, 12-fold weaker than ADP, although the additional g-phosphate group could potentially form additional inter-

actions, and at least 300-fold weaker than ATP. A similar discrepancy of the affinity was found in the case of hsc70 with Kd ATP = 0.012 mM and Kd AMPPNP = 2.8 mM (Gao et al., 1994). Since the binding of MABA-ADP to DnaK results in an appreciable change in fluorescence signal of the MANT group, it is possible to use stopped-flow measurements to obtain the rate constants for association and dissociation of MABA-ADP and ADP, respectively. The time-course for the displacement of MABA-ADP by ADP followed a single exponential equation (k = 22(24) × 10-3 s-1, see Table 2). Similar measurements allowed us to establish the dissociation rate constant of ADP when displaced by MABA-ADP (k = 35(29) × 10-3 s-1 ). The rate constant for the dissociation of MABA-ATP is more difficult to determine, since there is concurrent dissociation of MABA-ATP and hydrolysis with subsequent rapid release of MABA-ADP. The observed rate constant in this type of experiment was kobs = 2.5 × 10-3 s-1. The rate constant for dissociation of MABA-ATP can be calculated as: koff (MABA-ATP) = kobs - khyd = (2.5 - 1.6) × 10-3 s-1 = 0.9 × 10-3 s-1 the determination of the rate constant of hydrolysis khyd is described below.

Figure 2. Hydrolysis of ATP is the rate- limiting step of the DnaK-ATPase cycle. The nucleotides ATP (T) and MABA-ATP (w) were hydrolyzed by DnaK with rate constants of 1.5(20.1) × 10-3 s-1 and 1.6(20.1) × 10-3 s-1 under single turnover conditions, respectively. The turnover rate of ATP under steady-state conditions is 1.5(20.1) × 10-3 s-1 and thus hydrolysis can be identified unambiguously to be the rate-determining step. The nucleotide AMPPNP hydrolyzed with khyd = 0.03(20.003) × 10-3 s-1 in buffer but no hydrolysis is detectable on the enzyme (W), which sets an upper limit for the hydrolysis of AMPPNP when bound to DnaK of 0.003 × 10-3 s-1. The enzyme-nucleotide complexes were quenched with perchloric acid and analyzed with HPLC as described in Materials and Methods. Experimental conditions: 80 mM DnaK, 40 mM MABA-ATP (w), ATP (T) or AMPPNP (W), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithioerythritol, 25°C.

It is important to note that, in our hands, the rate constant for the dissociation of ADP is hardly affected (ca twofold) by the presence of 2 mM Pi , in contrast to Burkholder et al. (1994), who report a decrease in the rate constant for dissociation of ADP of up to tenfold. However, the weak effect of 2 mM Pi on the dissociation constant of ADP would be consistent with the model described by Ha & McKay (1994), who proposed an ordered binding mechanism of ADP and Pi for bovine hsc70 with ADP binding first and a Kd of Pi to the hsc70·ADP complex of ca 1 mM. It was not shown, however, whether at saturating concentrations of Pi the dissociation of ADP is completely prevented as would be expected from an ordered mechanism. Rate-limiting step of overall cycle In order to determine the rate-limiting step of the overall ATPase rate, we measured the hydrolysis of ATP by DnaK under single turnover conditions. ATP was saturated with nucleotide-free DnaK and the reaction was acid-quenched and analyzed by HPLC after different time intervals. This method does not rely on product release, avoids possible product inhibition and thus directly measures the rate constant of hydrolysis. The nucleotides ATP and MABA-ATP were hydrolyzed (Figure 2) with rate constants of 1.5 (20.1) × 10-3 s-1 and

Fluorescent nucleotides were displaced by native nucleotides and vice versa under conditions where the displacement was virtually complete. The resulting time traces were analyzed by single exponential functions (see the text). a Fluorescence signal of the single tryptophan residue instead of MABA-ADP was used. The preincubation times with ATP were less than 10 s before displacing nucleotides were added to avoid significant hydrolysis.

1.6(20.07) × 10-3 s-1, respectively. The turnover rates of ATP and MABA-ATP under steadystate conditions are 1.5(20.17) × 10-3 s-1 and 1.6(20.17) × 10-3 s-1, respectively. This identifies hydrolysis unambiguously as the rate-determining step, as already suggested from indirect experiments (McCarty et al., 1995). The nucleotide AMPPNP hydrolyzed with khyd = 0.03(20.003) × 10-3 s-1 in buffer but no hydrolysis is detectable on the enzyme, which sets an upper limit for the hydrolysis of AMPPNP when bound to DnaK of 0.003 × 10-3 s-1. AMPPNP seems to be protected from hydrolysis when bound to DnaK. The fluorescent nucleotide MABA-ATP again proves to be an ideal analog, since in addition to having binding parameters comparable with ATP, it hydrolyzes with a rate constant that is virtually identical with that of ATP. The rate constant of dissociation of ADP (k = 35(29) × 10-3 s-1 ) is thus 20 times faster than hydrolysis and is therefore consistent with hydrolysis being the rate-limiting step of the overall ATPase activity of DnaK. It is noteworthy that the observed rate constant for hydrolysis in single turnover experiments is virtually identical in the presence and absence of excess of competing ADP. This indicates that after binding of ATP to DnaK it is not possible to efficiently displace the triphosphate by excess ADP, so that the rate constant for dissociation of ATP must be slower than the rate of hydrolysis with khyd = 1.5 × 10-3 s-1. This is consistent with the displacement experiments for MABA-ATP as described above. Tryptophan fluorescence The dependence of the fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue of DnaK (Trp102) as a function of the presence of different nucleotides is shown in Figure 3. The addition of ATP to nucleotide-free DnaK (Figure 3A) results in a decrease of the fluorescence signal of the single tryptophan residue of DnaK of 15% (Figure 3B). The emission wavelength is concurrently shifted from 345 nm to 342 nm. The addition of ADP and Pi to nucleotidefree protein causes the signal to increase by 7% (Figure 3E) and the same amplitude is reached if the bound ATP is allowed to hydrolyze to completion (Figure 3C). However, the addition of ADP (D), Pi , AMP or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP (data not shown) do not cause any change of the signal. This lack of any observable change of the fluorescence of Trp102 was not caused because those nucleotides were not able to bind. In fact, experimental conditions were chosen such that the protein was virtually saturated by the added nucleotides according to their affinities as measured with competition experiments with the extrinsic MABA-ADP probe (Table 1). It was reported previously (Banecki et al., 1992) that like ATP, the addition of AMPPNP causes a decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence. Neverthe-

Figure 3. Fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue of DnaK in the absence and presence of different nucleotides. The addition of ATP (B) to nucleotide-free DnaK (A) results in a decrease of the fluorescence signal of the single tryptophan residue of DnaK of 15%. The addition of ADP and Pi to nucleotide-free protein causes the signal to increase by 7% (E) and the same amplitude is reached if the bound ATP is allowed to hydrolyze to completion. The addition of ADP (D), Pi , AMP or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP (data not shown) does not change the signal. Experimental conditions were: 4.8 mM nucleotide-free DnaK and standard buffer at 25°C (see Materials and Methods) and A: no addition of nucleotide; B: 50 mM ATP; C: 4.9 mM ATP after two hours, which allows hydrolysis (khyd = 1.5 × 10-3 s-1 ) to reach 98% completion; D: 5 mM ADP; E: 5 mM ADP and 100 mM Pi . The excitation wavelength was 295 nm and the wavelength for the maximal emission changed from 345 to 342 nm upon addition of ATP and reverted to 345 nm upon hydrolysis. Samples were incubated for two hours prior to measurements. The saturation with nucleotides was virtually complete as judged by the measured dissociation constants (see Table 1).

less, these measurements are consistent with our observations if one considers that the previous work was performed with DnaK that was not nucleotide and Pi-free. If the starting condition was the DnaK·ADP·Pi complex, then the addition of AMPPNP should displace ADP and Pi and cause a decrease of some 7% in the fluorescence signal, as was indeed observed (Banecki et al., 1992). It is important to emphasize that AMPPNP is not able to change the tryptophan fluorescence signal of DnaK, since this correlates with its inability to cause peptide release (see below). It was shown recently that the ATP-induced change of fluorescence requires the presence of the C-terminal peptidebinding region and therefore was interpreted to result from altered domain interactions and not merely from conformational changes of the ATPase domain (Buchberger et al., 1995). AMPPNP and ATPgS are not able to induce a conformational change, as judged by the lack of a change in the tryptophan signal of DnaK upon binding of ATP. It is possible that the different geometry of the Pb-N-Pg phosphate bond or the Mg2+ coordination is responsible for altered binding

662

by the enzyme (Yount, 1975). A missing or weakened interaction with the b-g phosphatebridging nitrogen atom versus oxygen atom is also a likely reason. A possible explanation for the inability of ATPgS to induce the ATP conformation is that interactions of all three oxygen atoms of the g-phosphate group with the protein and the magnesium ion at the active site are important. ATP binds to DnaK with a two-step binding mechanism The observation that the binding of ATP to DnaK decreases the tryptophan fluorescence by 15% was used to monitor the time-resolved binding of ATP with a stopped-flow device. Different concentrations of excess ATP were mixed with nucleotidefree DnaK and the time trace for each individual ATP concentration was fitted to a simple exponential equation to yield an apparent rate constant for the binding process (Figure 4, curve A). This apparent rate constant follows a hyperbolic curve (Figure 4, curve B), which is indicative of a two-step binding process as shown in Scheme 1. The change of the enzyme from E to E* indicates a conformational change that is observed as a change in the tryptophan fluorescence.

The first step is a rapid equilibrium and can be described by an equilibrium constant of Kd 1 = 7.3(21.4) mM. The rate constants of the second step are described by the intercept of the curve with the y-axis of k-2 = 0.045 s-1 and the amplitude with k+2 = 1.5(20.06) s-1. The overall affinity of ATP can thus be calculated as: Kd ATP = Kd 1 · k-2 0.045 s-1 = 7.3 mM = 0.22 mM k+2 1.5 s-1

Curve A, equal volumes of DnaK and ATP were mixed in a stopped-flow apparatus to give 1 mM DnaK and the following ATP concentrations: 2 mM (w), 3 mM (W), 4 mM (q), 5 mM (Q) and 12.5 mM (r). The change of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and a cut-off filter for the emission wavelength at 320 nm. The time traces could be described by a single exponential equation indicated by the continuous lines with apparent rate constants of 0.23, 0.33, 0.46, 0.73 and 0.97 s-1, respectively. Higher concentrations of ATP (up to 1000 mM) were used, but are not shown here. All solutions contained standard buffer. Curve B, the observed rate constant for the binding of ATP to nucleotide-free DnaK follows a hyperbolic curve, which is indicative of a two-step binding process where the first

The intercept with the y-axis of 0. 045 s-1 represents an upper limit, however, and thus also the Kd of 0.22 mM for ATP has to be considered as being an upper limit. The partitioning experiments described above rather indicate that the rate

step is fast and can be described by an equilibrium constant of Kd 1 = 7.321.4 mM. The rate constants of the second step are described by the intercept of the curve with the y-axis of k-2 = 0.045 s-1 and the amplitude with k+2 = 1.520.06 s-1 (see the text). Curve C, the binding of ATP to a complex of nucleotide-free DnaK and 200 mM peptide CIII (see the text) also follows a two-step binding process as described above. The equilibrium constant Kd 1 is 118227 mM and the rate constants of the second step is k+2 = 1621 s-1, approximately ten times faster than in the absence of peptide.

A similar two-step binding mechanism of ATP was described for bovine hsc70 (Ha & McKay, 1995). However, we were not able to resolve the kinetics of the first step as described for hsc70 with k+1 = 7 × 105 M-1 s-1 and k-1 = 1.1 s-1 (Ha & McKay, 1995). The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK as a monitor for hydrolysis The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK increases slowly after the initial rapid quenching upon addition of ATP (Figure 5). It is important to note that the increase of the tryptophan signal shows a lag phase, indicating that the first step of a kinetic reaction sequence is spectroscopically silent. The time-course of this single turnover experiment can be described by Scheme 2. E*·ATP K E*·ADP·Pi K E**·ADP·Pi Scheme 2 As described above, E* indicates the low fluorescent state of the single tryptophan residue of DnaK that is induced upon the binding of ATP and E** indicates the high fluorescent state that is reached after hydrolysis of ATP or upon the simultaneous addition of ADP and Pi . The kinetic equation that describes the formation of E** according to the irreversible consecutive reaction in Scheme 2 is: [E**·ADP·Pi ](t) = [E*·ATP·Pi ](t = 0) 1 +

Figure 5. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK as a monitor for hydrolysis. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK increases slowly after it was quenched by 12% upon addition of ATP. The time-course of this single turnover experiment can be described by the sum of two exponential components that describe two irreversible consecutive reactions (see the text). The increase of the fluorescence signal corresponds to the conversion of the ATP quenched form E*·ATP to E**·ADP·Pi and occurs in the second reaction. The conditions of the experiment were 4.8 mM enzyme, 4.0 mM ATP and standard buffer at 25°C. The emission wavelength was 345 nm and the excitation wavelength was 295 nm.

It has to be noted that Scheme 2 is a simplification such that the two steps are treated as irreversible reactions, although we have no indication that k-3 and k-4 are completely negligible. However, the product of k-3 and k-4 must be much smaller than the product of k+3 and k+4 , since we were not able to synthesize ATP on the enzyme by adding up to 2 mM of inorganic phosphate (Pi ) in the presence of Mg2+ to a stochiometric DnaK·ADP complex. The detection limit of the HPLC analysis (see Materials and Methods) sets an upper limit of 1% ATP being synthesized during the incubation of two hours. The fit resulted in k3 = 1.8(20.3) × 10-3 s-1 and k4 = 0.7(20.07) × 10-3 s-1 and an amplitude of 714214. The rate constant k3 is virtually identical with the rate of hydrolysis with khyd = 1.5 × 10-3 s-1 and k4 is twofold slower. Therefore we assume that k3 corresponds to the rate of hydrolysis. The

subsequent increase in fluorescence (generation of E**·ADP·Pi ) is caused by a structural change that follows hydrolysis. Consistent with this interpretation is the fact that the same increase of fluorescence can be achieved by simultaneous addition of ADP and Pi with k5 = 0.9(20.1) × 10-3 s-1 (data not shown). The second conformational change from E* to E** was not seen with bovine Hsc70 and appears to be one of the major differences between DnaK and hsc70. It is unclear whether this reflects the different positioning of the tryptophan residues or different structural responses of these two enzymes to the formation of the E·ADP·Pi complex. It is interesting to note that infrared spectra of DnaK changed upon hydrolysis of ATP, although the enzyme used was not nucleotide-free and the change observed upon the addition of ATP may be caused by displacement of ADP and Pi as mentioned above (Banecki et al., 1992).

Affinity of Pi to DnaK·ADP We made use of the observation that in the case of DnaK and in contrast to hsc70 (Ha & McKay, 1994), addition of Pi to a DnaK·ADP complex results in an increase of the tryptophan fluorescence signal by 7% (Figure 3). Accordingly, a titration of Pi to DnaK·ADP allowed us to determine the binding stoichiometry to be 1:1 with a Kd of 0.45 (20.23) mM. This result suggests that the high-affinity binding of Pi to the DnaK·ADP

Figure 6. Binding of ATP to a DnaK·peptide complex causes peptide release. A, The equilibrium signal of the fluorescently labeled model peptide s32-24 (C-NBD, see the text) increases by 165% upon binding to DnaK. The binding can be described by a simple 1:1 binding process with Kd = 1.120.3 mM. The initial concentration of peptide was 1.4 mM in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithioerythritol and 100 mM KCl at 25°C. The excitation wavelength was 493 nm and emission was detected at 545 nm. B, Displacement of s32-24 (C-NBD) by excess unlabeled s32-24. The measured time-course follows a single exponential equation with koff = 0.0034 s-1. Experimental conditions: 0.3 mM s32-24 (C-NBD), 0.4 mM DnaK and additionally 38 mM s32-24 in standard buffer. C, The fluorescent peptide s32-24 (C-NBD, see the text) is released completely when the complex of DnaK and peptide is chased with ATP. The data follow a single exponential curve with a rate constant for the release of peptide of k = 3.820.2 s-1. Further addition of unlabelled peptide s32-24 (V) or higher amounts of ATP did not change the fluoresence signal, which shows displacement of peptide to be complete. In relation to the two-step binding process of ATP (Figure 4B) the release of the peptide seems to be coupled to the second step that corresponds to a conformational change resulting in the release of peptide. Experimental conditions: 1 mM peptide s32-24 (C-NBD), 1 mM nucleotide free DnaK and 400 mM ATP in standard buffer. D, Stimulation of ATPase activity of DnaK by s32-24 (C-NBD). The ATPase activity of DnaK was measured dependent on the concentration of the fluorescently labelled peptide s32-24 (C-NBD) in single turnover experiments as described for Figure 2. The intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaK is stimulated fivefold with an apparent dissociation constant of Kd = 725 mM for the binding of s32-24 (C-NBD) to the DnaK·ATP complex. The initial conditions were 10 mM DnaK and 8 mM ATP in standard buffer at 25°C.

complex is specific, since it results in the same fluorescence signal that is produced after hydrolysis of ATP and thus is on the kinetic pathway of the ATPase activity of DnaK. The high affinity of Pi to the DnaK·ADP complex in combination with the only twofold decrease in the rate constant for dissociation of ADP at a concentration of Pi that exceeds the Kd (0.45 mM) by a factor of 4000 suggests a random binding mechanism of ADP and Pi in the case of DnaK. The dissociation constant of MABA-ADP is decreased by a factor of 4 in the presence of 2 mM Pi compared with the absence of Pi . The binding of ADP and Pi to DnaK thus appears to be synergistic.

The binding of Pi to the DnaK·ADP-complex seems to be fundamentally different from the binding of Pi to the hsc70·ADP complex. The dissociation rate constant of Pi from hsc70·ADP·Pi was determined to be 3.8 × 10-3 s-1, comparable with the rate of hydrolysis (khyd = 3 × 10-3 s-1 ) and the corresponding dissociation constant was estimated to be 1 mM (Ha & McKay, 1994). In contrast, the dissociation rate constant of Pi for the DnaK·ADP·Pi-complex must be at least ten-times faster than the rate of hydrolysis (khyd = 1.5 × 10-3 s-1 ), since otherwise the rate of hydrolysis determined under steady-state conditions would not match the rate determined under single

665 DnaK (J. McCarty and B.B., unpublished results). Second, the association kinetics of s32-24 (C-NBD) to DnaK in the presence of excess ATP gave a rate constant for dissociation of s32-24 (C-NBD) of 1.3(20.13) s-1 (data not shown), indicating that it is the peptide release that is rate limiting and not the conformational change upon ATP binding which increases the peptide exchange rates. Interestingly, the dissociation constant of AMPPNP of 1.6 mM is comparable with the dissociation constant of ATP of the first preassociation step with Kd = 7.3 mM. This is consistent with the interpretation that AMPPNP is not able to induce the second slow step of binding that decreases the Kd of ATP ca 1000-fold and triggers peptide release. Consistent with this interpretation is the inability of AMPPNP to produce a change in the tryptophan signal or to cause peptide release. In either case the rates of the ATP-induced conformational change of DnaK and of the ATPinduced peptide release are much faster than the rate of hydrolysis (unstimulated and stimulated). This shows directly that binding of ATP, and not hydrolysis, causes peptide release. It has to be noted, however, that despite the dramatic increase of the exchange rate of the peptide in the presence of ATP, the dissociation constant is increased only moderately (five to tenfold), since the association and the dissociation rate constant are increased to a similar extent. In fact, the peptide is able to increase ATPase activity at high concentrations, since it binds with moderate affinity (Kd 1 7 mM, Figure 6D) to the DnaK·ATP complex. Peptide release caused by ATP binding may thus be observed only if the actual peptide and DnaK concentrations are well below some 10 mM, as is the case in the experiment described in Figure 6C. The main role of ATP binding is thus to facilitate peptide exchange.

turnover conditions. Additionally, the dissociation constant of Pi for the DnaK·ADP complex was measured to be 0.45 mM, 2000 times lower than that determined for hsc70 (Ha & McKay, 1994). Peptide release is coupled to the second step of ATP binding Recent evidence indicated that ATP binding, and not hydrolysis, is sufficient to cause peptide release (Palleros et al., 1993; Schmid et al., 1994; McCarty et al., 1995). It was shown that this effect was caused by an increase in the rate constant of dissociation and, to a lesser extent, by an increase of the rate constant of association of the peptide. We used a fluorescent model peptide, s32-24 (C-NBD), that contains 24 amino acid residues (KVATTKAQRKLFFNLRKTKQRLGK) of the heat shock transcription factor s32 . The peptide comprises a high-affinity binding site that was identified to be responsible for binding of s32 to DnaK (Nagai et al., 1994; McCarty et al., 1996) and an N-((2-(acetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitro-benz-2-oxa-1,3diazole (NBD) fluorescence label that is attached to the single cysteine introduced in this peptide instead of valine (V2C) and can be used to monitor the binding (Figure 6A) and release (Figure 6B) of peptide. The peptide binds with Kd = 1.1 mM to nucleotide-free DnaK and dissociates with a rate constant of k = 0.0034 s-1. This peptide is released much faster, however, when the complex of DnaK and peptide is mixed with ATP. The data (Figure 6C) follow a single exponential curve with a rate constant for the release of peptide of k = 3.8(20.2) s-1. The stimulation of the peptide exchange rate by ATP is thus 1000-fold. Further addition of unlabelled peptide s32-24 (V) or of higher amounts of ATP did not change the fluorescence signal, indicating that the displacement of peptide is complete. In relation to the two-step binding process of ATP (Figure 4), the release of the peptide seems to be coupled to the second step, since the rate constant of hydrolysis measured with single turnover experiments is accelerated only five times with saturating amounts of the s-peptide and is thus much slower than the ATP-induced peptide release (Figure 6D). The rate constants for the second step of ATP binding as observed by the tryptophan fluorescence signal (k+2 = 1.5 s-1) and the rate of ATP-induced peptide release with koff = 3.8 s-1 are very similar. The twofold difference could be caused by two different effects: firstly, k+2 might be slightly altered in the presence of peptide or secondly, k+2 might be accelerated in the presence of peptide to a significant extent, but the intrinsic off rate of the peptide from the DnaK*·ATP·peptide complex is limited to 3.8 s-1. We have evidence that the second case is actually true. First, the two-step binding mechanism of ATP is affected by peptide. The rate constant k+2 is increased to 16 s-1 in the presence of a peptide stretch of the CIII protein (Figure 4, curve C) of bacteriophage l, which is a natural substrate of

Conclusions
The application of the novel fluorescent nucleotide analogs MABA-ADP and MABA-ATP in combination with nucleotide-free DnaK and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK led us to the following description of the catalytic cycle of DnaK (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3.

666 ATP binds to DnaK in a two-step binding mechanism with an initial weak complex (Kd 1 = 7.3 mM) that is formed rapidly, followed by a second slow step (k+2 = 1.5 s-1 and k-2 E 1.5 × 10-3 s-1 ) that is equal to or smaller than the observed rate constant of hydrolysis with k+3 = 1.5 × 10-3 s-1. This second step appears to be central for the activity of the chaperone, since it correlates with peptide release caused by the binding of ATP (koff s32-peptide = 3.8 s-1 ) and switches DnaK from the high-affinity state to the low-affinity state of peptide binding. Presumably it is a conformational change that also increases the affinity of ATP by 103 and causes a change in the intrinsic tryptophan signal by ca 15% to give the E* state (another line of evidence is that AMPPNP binds like ATP in the first step, but does not change the tryptophan fluorescence signal and does not cause peptide release). The complex formed after hydrolysis (E*·ADP·Pi ) then undergoes another conformational change with an apparent rate constant k+4 = 0.7 × 10-3 s-1, as indicated by a second change of the tryptophan fluorescence signal to give E**·ADP·Pi . The same structural change can be obtained by the simultaneous addition of ADP and Pi with k-5 obs = 0.9 × 10-3 s-1. It therefore appears that the stable conformation that is formed in the presence of ADP and Pi does not have to be formed from ATP, but is kinetically accessible from the product direction. The dissociation rate constant of the product ADP (k+6 ) is = 35 × 10-3 s-1 and thus ca 20 times faster than the rate of hydrolysis with (k+3 = 1.5 × 10-3 s-1 ). The rate constant for dissociation of Pi or ADP from E*·ADP·Pi (k+7 ) was not measured directly, but must be at least ten times faster than the rate of hydrolysis. Otherwise, a significant difference would be observed between the ATPase activity as determined by steady-state measurements as compared with single turnover experiments. The amount of ATP bound to DnaK under steady-state conditions (at 5 mM DnaK and 100 mM ATP) was determined to be 80 to 90% (McCarty et al., 1995) which indicates that k+7 is five to ten times faster than the rate constant of hydrolysis (k+3 = 1.5 × 10-3 s-1 ). This would be consistent with a rate constant for dissociation of ADP from E*·ADP·Pi of 7.5 × 10-3 s-1 to 15 × 10-3 s-1, similar to k+6 in the presence of 2 mM Pi . The conclusion drawn from this set of rate constants is that under steady-state conditions with excess ATP, most of the enzyme bypasses the slow formation of E**. The population of the different conformational states of DnaK thus appears to depend mainly on the two slowest steps of the overall cycle. The ATPase activity is rate limiting, with k+3 = 1.5 × 10-3 s-1 followed by product release with k+7 = 7.5 × 10-3 s-1 to 15 × 10-3 s-1. The state that would be predominantly occupied in this peptidefree unstimulated ATPase cycle is E*·ATP, the form of DnaK that we showed to have a moderately

decreased affinity for peptides but much higher exchange rates as compared with the enzyme form that is stable in the absence of nucleotide (E) or in the presence of ADP, Pi or AMPPNP. The other state of DnaK would be that of E*·ADP·Pi , of which we do not yet know the peptide-binding properties, but assume that it constitutes a high peptide affinity state like E. The asterisk would then only be a notation for the fluorescent state of the enzyme, but not necessarily reflect the peptide-binding properties. Because of the similarity of the rate constants by which E*·ATP and E*·ADP·Pi decompose, these two important enzyme states are well suited to be regulated by the ATPase-stimulating factor (DnaJ) that increases k+3 and thus decreases the population of E*·ATP versus E*·ADP·Pi , and the nucleotide exchange factor (GrpE) that increases k+7 and would therefore have the opposite effect. It is interesting to note that the stimulation of these two steps seems to be comparable in magnitude: DnaJ stimulates hydrolysis (k+3 ) at least 100-fold, whereas GrpE stimulates nucleotide exchange at least 100-fold as measured with single turnover experiments and stopped-flow experiments with MABA-ADP (H.T. and J.R., unpublished results). The binding of DnaJ to the DnaK·ATP complex would thus accelerate the switch of DnaK from the low-affinity, high exchange rate form (E*·ATP in Scheme 3) to a high-affinity, low exchange rate (E*·ADP·Pi ). This mechanism could be the molecular basis for targeting (Alfano & McMacken, 1989; Langer et al., 1992; McCarty et al., 1995) and transport processes (Schatz & Dobberstein, 1996). In the case of DnaJ any peptide or protein that would be bound to DnaJ initially would be vectorially transferred to DnaK by this trapping mechanism, where the presence of DnaJ converts DnaK to the high-affinity form. Recently, evidence was presented that the interaction of s32 with DnaJ is indeed very fast and that the stimulation of ATPase activity of DnaK by DnaJ mediates efficient binding of s32 to DnaK (Gamer et al., 1996). In the case of transport processes, the localization of a functional equivalent of DnaJ at a membrane channel that is permeable for unfolded proteins would result in a specific delivery of hsc70 (or analogous) proteins at this point of a compartment and thus mediate vectorial transport. This trapping mechanism would favour the biased diffusion model. The functional role of GrpE could be to facilitate the recycling of DnaK to the low-affinity ATP-form by accelerating nucleotide exchange. It has to be noted that GrpE could be involved in targeting, since an hsc70-coated unfolded protein would be released efficiently (and thus be allowed to fold) only in the presence of GrpE, which mediates nucleotide exchange to the low-affinity ATP form of DnaK. The ATPase cycle of DnaK thus brings about a delicate balance of at least two enzyme forms that apparently alternate in their affinity and exchange

colorometric assay (Adam, 1962), peak fractions containing the protein with a turnover number of at most 1 × 10-3 s-1 were pooled and dialysed twice at 4°C against the storage buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM dithioerythritol). After concentration (Minicon) the DnaK solution was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. The same colorometric assay as described above was used to ensure that no residual phosphate was present in the DnaK preparation. The degradation of phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) in the absence of ATP is an indication of the presence of alkaline phosphate. The final yield of nucleotide-free DnaK was some 100 mg protein from 100 g of overproducing E. coli cells. Synthesis of MABA-AMP The fluorophores N8-(4-N '-methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine 5'-tri- and diphosphate (MABAATP and MABA-ADP) were synthesized in a four-step reaction. The starting material was AMP that was converted to N8-(4-aminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine 5'phosphate (ABA-AMP; Barker et al., 1974). ABA-AMP (50 mmol) was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.5 M sodium carbonate (pH 9 to 10), and 600 ml of 200 mM of succinimidyl-N-methylanthranylate (SMANT, Molecular Probes) in dimethyl formamide (DMF) were added. The mixture was agitated vigorously and left at 50°C for about four hours. To quench unreacted SMANT, 1.3 ml of concentrated ammonia (final concentration 8 M) was added and after 30 minutes the reaction mixture was diluted with 60 ml of water at 4°C. To remove by-products, the solution was applied to the quaternary anion-exchange resin QAE Sephadex A 25 (2.2 cm × 13 cm, Pharmacia). After a wash with water, the column was eluted with a linear gradient to 0.3 M triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), pH 7.5. The effluent was monitored by measuring UV absorbance at 260 nm; the product elutes between 0.2 M and 0.25 M TEAB in a single peak. The fractions estimated to contain pure MABA-AMP were pooled and lyophilized three times from water. Purity of the product was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC with a C18-column (ODS-Hypersil, 5 mM 250 mm × 4.6 mm) and detection at 280 nm. The sample was eluted with 20% (v/v) acetonitrile in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), over 20 minutes at 2 ml/minute. A single major peak was observed after 12 minutes. The final concentration was determined by UV absorbance with e280 = 18,000 at pH 7.5. The molar extinction coefficient was obtained from MABA-ATP by enzymatic ATP-determination with hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Lamprecht & Trautschold, 1970). The yield of MABA-AMP from ABA-AMP was ca 50%. Synthesis of MABA-ATP MABA-AMP (31 mmol) was dissolved in 0.6 ml of water and 0.23 ml (1 mol) of tributylamine was added. The solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and the viscous residue was dried by repeated addition and evaporation of anhydrous pyridine (5 × 0.5 ml) followed by anhydrous DMF (3 × 0.3 ml). The anhydrous tributyl ammonium salt of MABA-AMP was dissolved in 0.5 ml of DMF and 24 mg (0.15 mmol) of N, N '-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) was added. The mixture was

Materials and Methods
Materials ATP and ADP (disodium salt) were purchased from Pharma Waldhof Mannheim. Tris (ultrapure), NADH (grade I), phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma, MgCl2·6H2 O from Aldrich, and EDTA and KCl were purchased from Fluka. Perchloric acid was purchased from Fisher. Standard buffer: all measurements were performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithioerythritol and 100 mM KCl at 25°C if not noted otherwise. Rapid purification of nucleotide free DnaK DnaK was purified from the overproducing E. coli strain BB 4156 (pUHE21-2fd dnaK+ ) as described (Palleros et al., 1992, 1993; Bukau & Walker, 1990; Buchberger et al., 1994) with significant modifications as follows. The cells (100 g) were lysed as described (Leberman et al., 1980) and after centrifugation for 40 minutes at 4°C (GSA rotor, 13,000 rpm) 0.34 g of ammonium sulphate per ml of supernatant were added at 4°C. After 30 minutes, the precipitate of the crude extract was centrifuged for one hour at 4°C (GSA rotor, 13,000 rpm). The protein pellet was resuspended in approximately 150 ml of buffer A (2 mM sodium azide, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM dithioerythritol) and then dialyzed twice against 2 l of buffer A for at least 4 hours. After dilution with 300 ml of buffer A, the crude extract was applied at 4°C to a Fractogel EMD-DEAE (Merck, 26 mm × 600 mm) column. The column was washed with buffer A and 0.15 M KCl followed by a linear gradient from 175 mM to 425 mM KCl. DnaK eluted between 280 and 330 mM KCl. After analysis by SDS-PAGE, the fractions containing proteins of 70 kDa were pooled, and again precipitated by ammonium sulphate as described above. The pellet was dissolved in 10 ml of buffer C (buffer A without MgCl2 ) and directly applied to a gel-filtration column (Superdex 200, Pharmacia, 320 ml) to remove excess magnesium from solution. The column was washed with 2 ml/minute of buffer C at room temperature. The protein eluted after 64 to 72 minutes, which corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of 140 to 70 kDa. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford (1976) protein assay (Biorad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. To remove nucleotides bound to DnaK, two units of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) per mg DnaK were added and allowed to react at room temperature for at least one hour. To control the extent of hydrolysis, an aliquot was subjected to nucleotide analysis by HPLC every 15 minutes as described below. To remove alkaline phosphatase, the solution was concentrated to 10 ml in a minicon B15 macrosolute concentrator (Amicon) and again applied to a Superdex 200 gel-filtration column (see above).

CH23 ), plus counterion (triethylammonium) peaks. The structural formula of MABA-ATP is shown in Figure 7. Steady-state analysis To measure the kinetic parameters for steady-state hydrolysis a colorimetric assay was used that couples the production of ADP to the oxidation of NADH (Adam, 1962). This assay has the important property that the product ADP that is formed upon hydrolysis is reverted to the substrate ATP by pyruvate kinase and phosphoenol pyruvate, and thus keeps the substrate concentration constant. The assay was performed at 25°C in standard buffer. The concentrations of the compounds of the colorimetric assay were 400 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 200 mM NADH, 33 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 83 mg/ml pyruvate kinase. The background ATPase activity of this coupled assay was found to be negligible compared with the ATPase activity of DnaK. Fluorescence measurements Fluorescence measurements were performed with a SLM ``Smart'' 8000 photon-counting spectrofluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 360 nm and the emmission wavelength was 440 nm. Unless stated otherwise, the buffer was 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and the temperature of the cuvette was held at 25°C using a water-bath. To determine the affinity of the fluorophore (MABA-ADP) to DnaK, a solution of about 0.3 mM MABA-ADP in 1 ml of standard buffer was titrated with enzyme. The dissociation constants were determined with a quadratic equation as described (Reinstein et al., 1990). Data analysis of fluorescence competition experiments The dissociation constants of unlabeled nucleotides were determined in competition experiments with labeled nucleotides as described (Thrall et al., 1996). Nucleotide analysis Nucleotides were analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography with a C18 column of 2 ml total volume (Bischoff) and detected at 254 nm. The isocratic elution system contained 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The retention times for the nucleotides were usually 2.3 minutes (ATP), 2.7 minutes (ADP) and 3.5 minutes (AMP) at a flow-rate of 2 ml/minutes at room temperature. Mix-quench experiments The formation of ADP in single turnover experiments was measured at 25°C by incubating DnaK and ATP or ATP analogs for various times and subsequent nucleotide analysis with HPLC as described above. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml of 1 M HClO4 to 20 ml of protein solution, kept on ice for one minute and 28 ml of 2 M potassium acetate was added to neutralize the sample prior to HPLC analysis. The sample was centrifugated at 5000 rpm (2100 g) for one minute to remove precipitated protein and 10 ml of the supernatant was analyzed for nucleotide contents by HPLC as described above.

agitated vigorously for 20 minutes and left overnight at room temperature in a desiccator. In order to hydrolyze excess CDI, 7.5 ml of methanol was added and after 30 minutes the mixture was concentrated to dryness at 40°C under reduced pressure. The imidazolide was dissolved in 0.3 ml of DMF and stored under anhydrous conditions. Pyrophosphoric acid (26.7 mg, 0.3 mmol) and 142 ml (0.6 mmol) of tributylamine were dissolved in methanol, evaporated, and then evaporated three times with 0.5 ml of pyridine and 10 ml of tributylamine (0.04 mmol). The precipitate was dissolved in 0.3 ml of dry dimethyl formamide (DMF), added to the imidazolide solution and, after shaking the mixture vigorously for 30 minutes, the reaction mixture was left in a desiccator at room temperature for one to two days. The precipitate of imidazolium phosphate that formed during the reaction was removed by centrifugation and extracted three times with 0.5 ml MF. The combined extracts were added to an equal volume of methanol, and the resulting solution was concentrated at 40°C. The residue was dissolved in 50% (v/v) aqueous ethanol (20 ml) and applied to a QAE Sephadex A25 column (see above). After washing with 100 ml of 50% (v/v) aqueous ethanol, the sample was eluted with a linear gradient to 1 M TEAB, pH 7.5. The eluent was monitored by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Three major peaks were observed: the first at about 0.25 M TEAB was unreacted MABAAMP, the second at 0.4 M TEAB was MABA-ADP (presumably from phosphoric acid in the pyrophosphoric acid) and the last peak at 0.6 M TEAB contained MABA-ATP. These fractions were pooled and lyophilized three times from water. Purity was determined by reverse-phase HPLC as described for MABA-AMP. A single major peak was observed at five minutes. The final concentration was determined by enzymatic ATP-determination (Lamprecht & Trautschold, 1970). The UV absorption properties are the same as for MABA-AMP. The yield of MABA-ATP was ca 27%. MABA-ADP can be prepared with tributyl-ammonium phosphate instead of the tributyl-ammonium pyrophosphate in the reaction sequence described above. 1 H-NMR (360 MHz) spectrum of MABA-ATP in 2H2 O (pH 7.0 at 24°C): The chemical shifts are relative to an external tetra methylsilane standard: 7.98 (s, 1H; H2), 7.27 (t, 1H, CH3" 3J (7.63 Hz), 7.15 (d, 1H, CH5") 3J (7.83 Hz), 6.68 (d, 1H, CH2") 3J (8.41 Hz), 6.50 (t, 1H, CH4") 3J (7.46 Hz), 5.96 (d, 1H, H1') 3J1'2' (7.8 Hz), 4.65 (t, 1H, H2') 3 J2'3' (6.74 Hz), 4.44 (m, 1H, H3'), 4.35 (s, 1H, H4'), 4.18 (m, 2H, H5'5"), 3.55 (m, 2H, CH24 ), 3.38 (m, 2H, CH21 ), 2.72 (s, 3H, Ph-N-CH3), 1.79 (m, 2H, CH22 ), 1.72 (m, 2H,
