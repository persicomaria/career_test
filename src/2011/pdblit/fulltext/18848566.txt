Abstract HtrA heat shock protease is highly conserved in evolution, and in Escherichia coli, it protects the cell by degradation of proteins denatured by heat and oxidative stress, and also degrades misfolded proteins with reduced disulfide bonds. The mature, 48-kDa HtrA undergoes partial autocleavage with formation of two approximately 43 kDa truncated polypeptides. We showed that under reducing conditions, the HtrA level in cells was increased and efficient autocleavage occurred, while heat shock and oxidative shock caused the increase of HtrA level, but not the autocleavage. Purified HtrA cleaved itself during proteolysis of substrates but only under reducing conditions. These results indicate that the autocleavage is triggered specifically by proteolysis under reducing conditions, and is a physiological process occurring in cells. Conformations of reduced and oxidized forms of HtrA differed as judged by SDS-PAGE, indicating presence of a disulfide bridge in native protein. HtrA mutant protein lacking Cys57 and Cys69 was autocleaved even without the reducing agents, which indicates that the cysteines present in the N-terminal region are necessary for stabilization of HtrA peptide. Autocleavage caused the native, hexameric HtrA molecules dissociate into monomers that were still proteolytically active. This shows that the N-terminal part of HtrA is essential for maintaining quaternary structure of HtrA. D 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction In response to stress such as heat shock, cells react by elevated expression of chaperone proteins and proteases. These proteins protect cellular proteins against denaturation, facilitate proper folding and degrade irreversibly denatured proteins, whose accumulation in cell might be toxic [1,2]. HtrA (DegP) protein of Escherichia coli is a heatshock-induced serine protease, localized on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane and indispensable for bacterial survival at temperatures above 42 jC (reviewed by Pallen

and Wren [3] and by Clausen et al. [4]). HtrA degrades abnormally folded proteins formed in periplasmic space at elevated temperatures [5,6] and at lower temperatures, it has a chaperone function [7]. It has been shown that HtrA participates in cellular defense against oxidative stress, by degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins localized in the cell envelope, especially those associated with the membranes [8]. HtrA is also involved in the removal of proteins lacking proper disulfide bonds [5,6,9]. Bacterial HtrA, apart from protection against thermal and oxidative stress, has been implicated in virulence of pathogenic bacteria (reviewed by Pallen and Wren [3] and Clausen et al. [4]). HtrA is part of a large family of related serine proteases, members of which are found in most organisms, including humans. To date, at least four human HtrA homologs have

been identified [4] and there is a strong evidence that they are involved in a cellular stress response, including heat shock or inflammation processes [10 ­12]. Recently, evidence emerged suggesting that hHtrA1 may function as a tumor suppressor protein [13] and there is an increasing set of reports indicating that hHtrA2 plays a regulatory role in apoptosis (reviewed by Clausen et al. [4]). The HtrA gene is highly conserved among mammalian species: the amino acid sequences encoded by HtrA cDNA clones from cow, rabbit, and guinea pig are 98% identical to human HtrA [10]. Since there is a high homology between the E. coli and human HtrA proteases (more than 40% identity with the major domain of humHtrA1) [10] and both function in stress response, research concerning the E. coli version of HtrA may help to understand structure, function and physiological role of the human protein(s). E. coli HtrA is synthesized as a 50-kDa preprotein from which a signal peptide of 26 amino acids is removed, most probably by signal peptidase [14,15]. The mature HtrA is a 48-kDa protein consisting of 448 residues of which His105, Asp135 and Ser210 form the catalytic triad residues [3,16]. It has been shown previously in our laboratory [16] and others [5] that the mature HtrA undergoes partial degradation. Preparations of purified HtrA contained, in addition to the mature 48-kDa protein, two major degradation products of approximately 43 kDa, arising in consequence of cutting occurring after Cys69 or after Gln82 of the mature protein. Since the preparations of mutant, proteolytically inactive HtrA proteins, did not contain the degradation products, we assumed that the degradation was an autocatalytic process. Moreover, the autocleavage was not observed in purified preparations of the wild-type HtrA, even upon prolonged incubation, which suggested that some other cellular factor(s) may participate in this process [16]. A similar phenomenon of self-degradation has been reported in the case of the cloned human HtrA1 homolog. hHtrA1 expressed in the in vitro transcription/translation system and in heterologous systems exhibited autocatalytic cleavage [10]. Gray et al. [11] demonstrated that the cloned wild-type human HtrA2 expressed in baculovirus system had molecular weight of 41 kDa, while HtrA2 with the putative active site serine mutation gave rise to a 58kDa product. It has been shown recently that cleavage of the first 133 amino acids of hHtrA2 occurred during import of this protein to mitochondria, resulting in a release of pro-apoptotic hHtrA2 into mitochondrial intermembrane space [4]. Recently, the crystal structure of HtrA has been resolved [4,17]. According to the published model, HtrA is a hexameric molecule formed by staggered association of two trimeric rings. This association results in formation of a molecular cage with proteolytic sites located on the inner wall of the central cavity. The two trimers are mainly connected by the long LA loops, located in the N-terminal parts of the HtrA polypeptides. The LA loops of opposing trimeric rings are wound around each other, forming three

corner pillars of the central cavity of protein. Additionally, the hexamer structure is stabilized by interaction of PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains, localized in C-terminal parts of polypeptides, with their symmetry mates. Thus, the HtrA hexamer might be considered as a relatively loose bound dimer of two trimers. Considering this model, the HtrA autocleavage cuts occur close to the C-terminal end of the LA loop. Theoretically, such cleavage should destabilize the quaternary structure of HtrA. However, the 3D structure of the entire C-terminal region of the LA loop has not been determined by structural analysis. The aim of this work was to study the mechanism of HtrA autocleavage resulting in removal of the N-terminal fragment and its impact on HtrA structure. We show here that the autocleavage occurs during proteolysis under reducing conditions and two cysteines (C57 and C69) are involved in this process, most probably by reduction of a disulfide bridge, and that the autocleavage leads to dissociation of the HtrA oligomer.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Bacteria and plasmids The strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1. 2.2. Chemicals Anti-HtrA polyclonal rabbit antibodies were purified on the affinity column (HtrA bound to Sepharose 4B, Pharmacia). Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Promega. Nitrocellulose type BA 83 0.2 Am for immunoblotting was obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. The Ni-NTA agarose was from Qiagen. Carboxymethyl dextran (CMD) dual-well cuvettes and the suitable coupling kit, consisting of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), were from Affinity Sensors. The other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fluka and were of the highest quality. 2.3. Protein purification The HtrA full-length protein and the HtrAS210A were purified basically as described previously [21]. The only modification was the lack of DTT in the buffer for opening the cells, which prevented the autodegradation of HtrA. The truncated HtrA (S-HtrA) was obtained as follows. Approximately 5 mg of purified HtrA was dialyzed overnight against 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH = 8.0) buffer. Then, HtrA was incubated with 50 mg of lysozyme in the presence of 2 mM DTT for 60 min at 37 jC. The mixture was dialyzed overnight against buffer B (50 mM imida-

The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer B and then S-HtrA was eluted with a linear gradient of 0­ 1 M KCl in buffer B (400 ml). Fractions containing truncated HtrA were concentrated using Centricon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 2.4. Electrophoresis of proteins and Western blotting Proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described by Laemmli [22]. Gels containing 10%, 12.5% or 15% (w/v) acrylamide were used. In some cases (as indicated in the text), nonreducing conditions were applied and h-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the system. Native electrophoresis was performed in 10% polyacrylamide gel, pH = 4.0 as described by Goldenberg [23]. Western blotting was performed as described in Ref. [24]. 2.5. Protein assay Protein concentration was estimated by staining with Amido Black and spectrophotometric measurement as described before [21]. 2.6. HtrA autocleavage in vitro Reaction mixtures (250 Al) containing 10 Ag of HtrA and 100 Ag of lysozyme, h-casein or BSA in 25 mM HEPES (pH = 8.0) buffer with or without 1.5 mM DTT were incubated at 37 jC. In some cases, DTT (as stated in the text) was

substituted with h-mercaptoethanol at concentration 50 or 100 mM, or by 30 mM glutathione (reduced form). At indicated times, 25 Al samples were taken and placed in 2 Â concentrated SDS-PAGE lysis buffer. The samples were then resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. 2.7. Autocleavage of HtrA in vivo E. coli B178 cells and E. coli BL20 htrAÀ transformed with high or low copy number plasmids carrying mutant htrA C57S C69S (D-Cys htrA) or wild type htrA (wt) genes were grown at 37 jC in Luria Bertani (LB) medium [25] to an OD595 of 0.2­ 0.3 and were submitted to a heat shock (45 jC) or treated with oxidizing or reducing agents. Plasmid pJS20 carrying htrA S210A C57S C69S was used as a negative control of proteolysis (it lacks active site serine 210). To the cultures containing pQE60 derivatives, 1 mM IPTG was added to induce HtrA synthesis. DTT was added to a final concentration 10 mM, ferrous sulfate 200 AM, hmercaptoethanol 50 mM. At the indicated times, samples containing aliquots of cells were taken, centrifuged and cells were resuspended in SDS-PAGE lysis buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, the presence of full-length and truncated HtrA was detected using Western analysis. 2.8. Redox properties of HtrA The in vivo redox state of HtrA was assayed by trapping the free thiols by iodoacetamide (IAA) essentially as described by Jakob et al. [26]. The in vitro redox state of purified HtrA was determined according to the method described by Hermanson [27]: 2

mg of purified HtrA was incubated in a reducing buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH = 8.0, 5 mM DTT) for 60 min at 37 jC. The reduced HtrA was washed from the excess of DTT and concentrated on Centricon 100 microconcentrator (Millipore) to concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml. The nonreduced HtrA was concentrated in the same way. The free sulfhydryl groups were trapped by 5-iodoacetoamidofluorescein (IAF). The reduced and nonreduced HtrA was incubated in 25 mM HEPES, pH = 8.0, in the presence of 10 mM IAF for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were subsequently electrophoresed in nonreducing conditions, stained with Coomassie B, and electrophoretic mobilities of the reduced and nonreduced HtrA were compared. 2.9. Size exclusion chromatography The reacting components (100 Al) were incubated at 37 jC for 30 or 60 min in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (pH = 8.0), 50 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM DTT before loading onto a Superdex 200 HR10/30 sizing column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with the same buffer. The chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min (room temperature) using Gold HPLC system (Beckman) equipped with a diode array detector. Elution of the proteins was monitored using absorption at 280 nm. Fractions were collected and proteins were visualized following SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The Superdex column was calibrated with the following BioRad molecular weight standards: bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine g-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobulin (17.5 kDa); and Sigma molecular weight standards: bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa), apoferritin from horse spleen (443 kDa), hamylase from sweet potato (200 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa) and BSA (66 kDa). 2.10. Binding studies with the resonant mirror biosensor Studies on interaction of FL-HtrA or S-HtrA with phospholipids (PLs) were carried out by using the resonant mirror biosensor IAsys plus (Affinity Sensors). The cuvettes used were of the CMD type with two wells. One well was used to immobilize FL-HtrA or S-HtrA, while the other well was used as a control. The immobilization procedure was essentially that described by Ref. [28]. The carboxyl groups of CMD were activated with EDC and NHS for 7 min. Then, the proper amount of desired protein, dissolved in 10 mM acetate pH 5.0, was incubated with the activated CMD for 7 min. After blocking the activated unreacted carboxyl groups with 1 M ethanolamine pH 8.5, and after several washings with 25 mM HEPES buffer, the amount of FL-HtrA covalently linked to the CMD matrix was 6 ng/mm2, whereas the amount of SHtrA immobilized was 8.5 ng/mm2. All experiments were carried out at 25 jC; 25 mM HEPES, 125 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and 40% ethanol were used as running and regeneration buffer, respectively. Binding studies were carried out

by adding into the cuvette 0.5 ­100 AM phosphatidylglycerol (PG) or cardiolipin (CL) in form of small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), made as described in Ref. [29]. Kinetics of the liposome ­ protein interaction at the surface of the optical biosensors was analyzed using FASTfit software supplied with the Iasys-plus instrument according to Edwards et al. [30,31] and as described in Ref. [32].

3. Results 3.1. The autocleavage of HtrA occurs in vivo under reducing stress conditions The most substantial cleavage of the wild-type HtrA with formation of the 43-kDa truncated polypeptide(s) (SHtrA) was observed at the early steps of purification procedure of the protein [16]. To exclude the possibility that the autocleavage of HtrA was only a nonphysiological process occurring in vitro, we monitored formation of the truncated HtrA in bacterial cells submitted to various stress conditions (heat shock, oxidative shock induced by ferrous ions, presence of the reducing agents). The results presented in Fig. 1 clearly showed that treatment of a culture with the reducing agents (DTT or h-mercaptoethanol) induced the synthesis of HtrA protein and promoted the autocleavage process. Both the induction and cleavage were more efficient in the presence of a stronger reducer DTT than h-mercaptoethanol. Heat shock and oxidative stress did cause an increase in the HtrA level but not the autocleavage (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 5). A trace amount of HtrA degradation product appeared in the case of oxidative stress, but molecular weight of this product was lower than that observed routinely under reducing conditions or during purification. We conclude that the autodegradation of HtrA is a natural process occurring when a living bacterial cell is exposed to reducing stress conditions.

E. coli B178 was grown in LB medium at 30 jC to an OD595 of 0.2 ­ 0.3 and then submitted to a heat shock or treated with various reducing or oxidizing agents. Extracts from equal numbers of cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and subjected to Western analysis using anti-HtrA serum. The lanes show HtrA protein levels of control cells grown at 30 jC (lanes 1 and 3), cells heat-shocked for 45 min at 45 jC (lane 2) and cells treated for 30 min with 50 mM h-mercaptoethanol (lane 4), 0.3 mM ferrous sulfate (lane 5) and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (lane 6). The arrows indicate positions of the full-length mature HtrA protein (FL-HtrA) and the truncated HtrA (SHtrA).

3.2. The autocleavage of HtrA occurs in vitro only under certain conditions, including reducing stress To test the conditions of the autocleavage of the purified HtrA protein, we incubated it at 37 jC in the presence of various reducing agents (DTT, h-mercaptoethanol and glutathione, reduced form) with or without a substrate. We observed a significant level of autocleavage only during the proteolysis of a substrate (lysozyme, h-casein) under reducing conditions (Fig. 2A ­ C). It is worth noticing that though h-casein, contrary to lysozyme, could be digested without reducing agents, the process of proteolysis was not accompanied by the HtrA autocleavage (Fig. 2C, lane 2). The cleavage, to occur efficiently, needed both the proteolytic action of HtrA and reducing conditions (Fig. 2C, lane

3). After 30 min at 37 jC under such conditions, approximately 25% HtrA was cleaved (Fig. 2A and not shown densitometrical results). Incubation of HtrA alone at 37 jC, even in the presence of 1.5 mM DTT for 60 min (Fig. 2C, lane 5), or incubation of HtrA with lysozyme or h-casein without a reducing agent did not result in autocleavage (Fig. 2A, lane 2 and C, lane 2). We observed that the speed of autocleavage was strictly correlated with the rate of degradation of a substrate. Increase in the rate of proteolysis (by increasing the temperature) or slowing down the process (by partial aggregation of a substrate or by lowering the pH of the reaction mixture) resulted in proportional changes of the yield of truncated HtrA: the faster the proteolysis, the more efficient the autocleavage (data not shown).

Fig. 2. Autocleavage of HtrA during proteolysis under reducing conditions in vitro. HtrA was incubated with lysozyme (A and B) or with h-casein (C) in the presence or absence of DTT (1.5 mM), h-mercaptoethanol (50 or 100 mM) and glutathione (reduced form, 30 mM) (GSH) at 37 jC. Control reactions without substrate were included (C, lanes 4 and 5). Samples were withdrawn at times indicated in the figure (A) and after 90 min (B) or 60 min (C), proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The arrows indicate positions of the full-length mature HtrA protein (FL-HtrA), the truncated HtrA (S-HtrA) and h-casein or lysozyme. In panel B, the bottom fragment of the gel, containing lysozyme, was deleted. Panel D shows autocleavage of HtrA at elevated temperature. HtrA was incubated at 45 jC for 90 min in the presence or absence of DTT (1.5 mM) and BSA, as indicated in the figure. Reaction mixtures (250 Al) contained 10 Ag of HtrA (lanes 1, 2 and 5, 6) or HtrA and 100 Ag of BSA (lanes 3, 4 and 7, 8) in 25 mM HEPES (pH = 8.0). Control samples ( = samples withdrawn at time 0) and samples after 90 min incubation at 45 jC were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10 % gel) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The arrows indicate positions of BSA, full-length HtrA (FL-HtrA) and the truncated HtrA (S-HtrA).

We noticed HtrA autodegradation when it was incubated in the absence of any other protein at 45 jC for 90 min, with or without DTT (Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 6). However, when bovine serum albumin (BSA) was present in the mixture without the reducing agent, the autodegradation was inhibited (Fig. 2D, lane 7). Our interpretation is that, most probably, HtrA in a diluted solution at higher temperature is not stable, undergoes denaturation and becomes a substrate for itself. BSA, which without DTT is not a substrate for HtrA (Fig. 2D, lane 7), may exert a stabilizing effect on HtrA and prevent its denaturation and self-cleavage. Under reducing conditions at 45 jC, BSA became a substrate for HtrA, and HtrA autocleavage occurred. This is visible in Fig. 2D, lane 8, as a decrease in the amount of the full-length HtrA. The formation of the truncated S-HtrA in this case was confirmed by Western blotting (results not shown). It may be interesting to point out that the rates of the HtrA autocleavage in the in vivo and in vitro experiments were comparable (see Fig. 1, lane 6 and Fig. 2A, lane 5). 3.3. In vivo and in vitro redox state of HtrA As shown above, HtrA undergoes autocleavage only in the presence of reducing agents. This fact raises the possibility that the redox active amino acids might be implicated in this process. Mature HtrA contains only two cysteines, located in the N-terminal region, at the positions 57 and 69 of the protein, which presumably could form a disulfide bridge. To test this possibility, we examined the redox status of HtrA in vivo and in vitro. We incubated cells or purified protein in the presence or absence of DTT and then blocked free sulfhydryl groups to prevent their uncontrolled reoxidation, using IAA in vivo (IAA can penetrate cell membranes) and 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (IAF) in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3A, the wild-type HtrA, expressed in cells and then reduced, had a decreased electrophoretic mobility when compared to nonreduced HtrA, similar to the mobility of the mutant, D-Cys HtrA. The difference was small but significant and reproducible. We did not expect a dramatic change in mobility, since the disruption of the putative disulfide bridge binding two Cys residues spaced by only 11 amino acids should not introduce a big change in the polypeptide conformation. Reduction of the purified HtrA resulted in a more pronounced mobility shift, when compared to the nonreduced protein (Fig. 3B), which is understandable, since binding of two IAF molecules should increase molecular weight by approximately 1 kDa (Mw of IAF = 515 Da). Additionally, an in vitro test with the Ellman reagent [33] gave a negative result confirming the lack of accessible SH groups in HtrA molecule (data not shown). These results indicate that the Cys57 and Cys69 form a disulfide bridge both in vivo and in vitro. Disruption of the S­ S bond could be a reason why HtrA autocleavage occurs under reducing conditions and vice versa. The presence of the disulfide bridge could stabilize HtrA polypeptide.

Fig. 3. In vivo and in vitro redox state of HtrA. (A) In vivo: E. coli bacteria BL20(pJS7), expressing wt HtrA and BL20(pJS21), expressing D-Cys HtrA were grown in LB medium at 37 jC to OD595 = 0.4. One culture of BL20(pJS7) was treated with 10 mM DTT for 15 min. Portions of 1.4 ml of each culture were withdrawn and mixed with 0.4 ml of 0.45 M IAA in 100 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, pH = 9.5. The samples were incubated at 37 jC for 2 min and the reaction was stopped with TCA (10% final concentration). The cells were centrifuged, washed twice with ethanol and resuspended in a nonreducing Laemmli lysis buffer. The samples were lyzed, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HtrA polyclonal antibodies. (B) In vitro: Purified wt HtrA protein (200 Al, 10 mg/ml) was reduced (treated for 1 h with 5 mM DTT) and then subjected to IAF treatment (as described in Materials and methods), along with a nonreduced protein sample. The resulting samples were resolved by nonreducing 10% SDS-PAGE. HtrA protein not treated with DTT/IAF was used as a control (flanking lanes).

3.4. HtrA lacking Cys residues in the N-terminal region is less stable in vivo and in vitro To test the possibility that the presence of the disulfide bridge Cys57 ­ Cys69 is important for the stability of HtrA molecule, we monitored appearance of the truncated SHtrA form in strains expressing the mutated HtrA C57S C69S, lacking both cysteines (D-Cys HtrA). We found that in cells expressing D-Cys HtrA, the truncated S-HtrA was produced in all tested conditions, including physiological, whereas in strains expressing wild type HtrA, S-HtrA appeared in bacteria grown in reducing conditions only (Fig. 4A ­C). The instability of D-Cys HtrA was observed both in the case of a physiological level of HtrA (HtrA expressed from a low-copy number plasmid) and an increased level of HtrA (HtrA expressed from a high-copy number plasmid), and was due to autocleavage, since the D-Cys HtrA lacking catalytic Ser210 was not cleaved (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that the lack of the S ­ S bridge stimulates autodegradation of HtrA molecule. This conclusion was further supported by an in vitro degradation assay, in which we used h-casein as a substrate for the wild-type and D-Cys HtrA, in the presence or absence of DTT. We found that h-casein was cleaved by both HtrA forms at a similar rate, but there were significant differences in the autocleavage behaviour. The wt HtrA autodegraded in the presence of DTT only, whereas D-Cys HtrA autodegraded also in the absence of DTT (Fig. 4D). It is also worth mentioning that all strains grew well in the presence of 10 mM DTT at 37 jC showing only approximately 20% decrease in growth rate as compared to the nontreated cultures (data not shown).

(C) The E. coli BL20 cells transformed with low copy number plasmids pJS7 (wt HtrA) and pJS21 (D-Cys HtrA) were grown at 30 jC and then submitted to various stress conditions, as described in Materials and methods. The aliquots of cultures were withdrawn and treated as above. The lanes show HtrA protein levels of control cells grown at 30 jC (lanes 1 and 6), cells treated for 60 min with 0.2 mM ferrous sulfate (lanes 2 and 7), 50 mM hmercaptoethanol (lanes 3 and 8), 10 mM DTT (lanes 4 and 9) and cells shocked for 45 min at 45 jC (lanes 5 and 10). (D) Purified D-Cys HtrA and wt HtrA were incubated with h-casein in the presence or absence of DTT (1.5 mM). At the indicated times, samples were withdrawn and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%).

3.5. During autocleavage, HtrA changes its oligomerization status Our finding that during proteolytic action under reducing conditions, the N-terminal fragment of HtrA is cleaved, prompted us to investigate whether the N-terminal region is involved in maintaining HtrA in oligomeric form. We monitored the state of HtrA oligomerization before and after proteolysis of a substrate under reducing conditions, using size exclusion chromatography. The reaction mixture containing FL-HtrA, substrate (lysozyme) and DTT was incubated for various periods of time and then applied onto a filtration column. The control FLHtrA was eluted at the position corresponding to molecular mass larger than 200 kDa, but smaller than 450 kDa (Fig. 5 and data not shown), confirming previously published data [4,38] showing that HtrA exists mainly in a hexameric form. Analysis of the eluted fractions showed that HtrA, initially present only in a hexameric form, disassembled partially during reaction as indicated by the second elution peak at a position of approximately 44 kDa, corresponding to HtrA monomer (Fig. 5). After

30 min of reaction, approximately half of the HtrA molecules were in a monomeric state (Fig. 5B) and after 60 min, about 60% of HtrA was monomeric (not shown). Incubation of HtrA with DTT alone (without a substrate) did not result in any change in oligomerization status (not shown). To check if the formed monomers and remaining hexamers were stable, we collected fractions containing separated monomers and hexamers, concentrated them and applied on the same filtration column. We found that the monomers were eluted in the position of monomers and the hexamers were eluted in a peak corresponding to hexameric form of HtrA. No additional peaks were detected (not shown). Our results indicate that during proteolysis of a substrate under reducing conditions, HtrA hexamers undergo irreversible dissociation to a monomeric form. The hexameric fraction contained FL-HtrA and S-HtrA almost in equal amounts, while the monomeric fraction consisted mainly of the truncated S-HtrA (Fig. 5C). Dissociation of HtrA oligomers during proteolysis was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. As shown in Fig. 5D, dissociation of HtrA occurred during proteolysis of lyso-

Fig. 5. Autocleavage causes dissociation of HtrA oligomers. The full-length HtrA protein (100 Ag) was incubated with lysozyme (500 Ag), in the presence of 1.5 mM DTT at 37 jC for 30 min and then size exclusion chromatography was performed (B). Panel A shows elution profile of full-length HtrA. The hexamer and monomer fractions indicated in B were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (C). The arrows indicate positions of full-length HtrA (FL-HtrA) and the truncated HtrA (S-HtrA). (D) HtrA wild type and HtrAS210A mutant proteins were incubated with lysozyme at 37 jC for 60 min, with or without 1.5 mM DTT, as described in Materials and methods. Control reactions without HtrA (lane 1) or without lysozyme (lanes 2 and 3) were included. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. The arrow indicates position of dissociated HtrA (probably monomers).

zyme under reducing conditions. HtrAS210A, proteolytically inactive mutant protein, did not dissociate in the presence of lysozyme and DTT (Fig. 5D, lane 5). This confirms that the dissociation process requires proteolysis and not only formation of a complex of HtrA with a substrate (such complexes are seen as the high molecular weight bands in Fig. 5D, lane 5). To test if proteolysis of a substrate without HtrA autocleavage may lead to dissociation of oligomers, we have analyzed HtrA after proteolysis of h-casein with and without DTT, using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HtrA dissociation was observed only in the presence of DTT, when the autocleavage occurred, but not without DTT, when the proteolysis but not autocleavage occurred (not shown). The coincidence of the cleavage of the N-terminus and dissociation of HtrA hexamers indicates that the Nterminal part of protein participates in formation of oligomers.

3.6. S-HtrA possesses a lower affinity for CL and PG than FL-HtrA It has been shown previously that HtrA is a peripheral protein of the inner membrane and that it interacts with phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL) in vitro [34]. Having found that proteolytial activity of HtrA under reducing conditions leads to autocleavage followed by dissociation of hexamers and formation of monomeric SHtrA, we set out to check if this process would change the interaction of HtrA with phospholipids. The interaction of PG or CL liposomes with FL-HtrA and S-HtrA was followed in real time by the IAsys resonant mirror biosensor. We obtained a series of association curves (Fig. 6) and the association profiles were used to calculate the association (Kass) constants, the dissociation constants (Kdiss) and KD (KD = Kdiss/Kass). The results of calculations are summarized in Table 2.

In the case of FL-HtrA, small differences were found in the values of KD, Kass and Kdiss related to the interaction of the protein with PG or CL. KD resulted slightly higher in the presence of PG, while both Kass and Kdiss resulted slightly lower in the presence of PG than in the presence of CL. These results indicate that FL-HtrA possesses a similar affinity for CL and PG. In the case of S-HtrA, the KD value obtained in the presence of PG was 6.5 times higher that that obtained in the presence of CL, indicating that S-HtrA has a lower affinity for PG than for CL.

Moreover, when comparing the data with those related to FL-HtrA, it appears that S-HtrA shows a significantly lower affinity for both phospholipids than FL-HtrA. Our findings suggest that the autocleavage at the N-terminal region of HtrA may lead to a weaker interaction of the truncated form of HtrA with the inner membrane. Indeed, we found a significant amount of S-HtrA in the fraction of soluble cellular proteins, whereas FL-HtrA copurified almost exclusively with the membrane fraction (data not shown).

4. Discussion The achievement of the proper conformation by a protein is crucial for its activity and may have a great impact on the molecule stability. Misfolded proteins are usually very unstable and are rapidly degraded. The correct folding of many exocytoplasmic proteins often requires the formation of disulfide bridges between two cysteine residues. In Gram-negative bacteria, disulfide bond formation normally occurs following export into periplasmic space, where environment is more oxidizing than in cytoplasm [35]. The crosslink introduced by formation of the S ­ S bond provides for increased protein stability [36].

HtrA protease plays an important role in the removal of misfolded proteins formed in bacterial envelope (composed of the inner and outer membranes and periplasm) as the effect of various stress conditions, including reducing environment [4]. It has been shown that HtrA is responsible for degradation of alkaline phosphatase lacking proper S ­ S bridges in vivo [9] and its expression is strongly stimulated by mutations disturbing native S ­ S bonds formation [9,37]. The results presented in this paper confirm that HtrA is able to cleave reduced substrates, like lysozyme and BSA, and show that reducing environment induces its level in the cell. Previously, increase of the HtrA level has been demonstrated during heat shock and oxidative stress [8]. It has been shown previously that the mature, 48-kDa HtrA protein undergoes partial degradation by autocatalytic cleavage occurring after Cys69 or after Gln82, resulting in the truncated, approximately 43-kDa proteins (SHtrA) [16]. Here we found that this autodegradation took place in cells exposed to reducing environment (DTT or h-mercaptoethanol) but was not observed in physiological conditions or during other stresses (heat shock, oxidative stress). This led to conclusion that the autocleavage of HtrA is a natural process occurring when a living bacterial cell is exposed to reducing stress conditions. Experiments performed with purified HtrA protein showed a significant level of autocleavage only during proteolysis of a substrate (lysozyme, h-casein) under reducing conditions, but not during proteolysis without reducing agents or in the presence of such agents without simultaneous proteolytic process. The in vivo and in vitro results taken together indicate that in a cell exposed to reducing conditions, HtrA degrades misfolded proteins (most probably those with reduced disulfide bonds) and in this process cleaves itself. The fact that autocleavage of HtrA occurred in the presence of reducing agents only suggested the involvement of the redox active amino acids. Mature HtrA contains only two cysteines, located in the N-terminal region, at the positions 57 and 69 of the protein, close to the cleavage sites. The redox state of these residues has not been estimated previously; furthermore, any structural data describing the region of the two cysteines is absent [17]. We found that addition of DTT caused reduction of both cellular and purified HtrA, as judged by the differences in the electrophoretic mobility of the protein. Furthermore, there were no accessible SH groups in purified HtrA protein when tested with Ellman's reagent. These results indicate that the Cys57 and Cys69 form a disulfide bridge both in vivo and in vitro. Since the differences in the electrophoretic mobility of the reduced and oxidized HtrA were not big, the cleavage of the S ­ S bond probably does not cause significant changes in the tertiary structure of protein. The reduction of the disulfide bridge in HtrA molecule did not require high concentra-

tions of reducing agents or treatment with strong denaturants, therefore we assume that the S ­ S bridge is well exposed to the solvent. Disruption of this S ­ S bond could be a reason why HtrA autocleavage occurs under reducing conditions and vice versa, presence of the disulfide bridge could stabilize HtrA polypeptide. To test this hypothesis, we checked stability of the mutant HtrA, lacking both cysteines (D-Cys HtrA), and showed that the autocleavage occurred in cells under all tested conditions (not only in reducing environment), independently of the level of DCys HtrA. Analogically--in the in vitro assays--S-HtrA was produced at the same rate in the presence or absence of DTT. These results further confirm stabilizing role of the Cys57 and Cys69 residues. Our finding is in agreement with the hypothesis of Clausen et al. [4] that proteolytic activation of HtrA requires conformational changes, in particular disruption of the structure formed by three loops, the LA* loop (aa 44­ 79) and the L1 ­ L2 loops participating in formation of the active site (the LA* loop originates from a different subunit than the L1 ­L2 loops). Theoretically, reduction of the disulfide bond in the LA loop might cause such activating conformational change, resulting in autocleavage. Very intriguing was the observation that the autocleavage process led to destabilization of HtrA hexamer, resulting in formation of protein monomers. The mechanism of this phenomenon could be explained on the basis of the recently published crystal structure of HtrA molecule [4,17]. The cleavage sites (after Cys69 and Gln82) are located at the Cterminal end of a linker loop (LA loop) connecting h-strand 1 (of the N-terminal region) and h-strand 2 (of proteolytic domain). This loop, together with the PDZ domains of Cterminus, plays an important role in connecting the trimeric rings within the hexameric molecule of HtrA (see Introduction). The cleavage disconnecting the N-terminal part of HtrA from the rest of the polypeptide should deprive the hexamer of one of its binding pillars. Our results are in agreement with the crystallography data, further confirming the involvement of the N-terminal region in maintaining the oligomeric structure. Since the cleaved form of HtrA, S-HtrA, seems to have a different quaternary structure, we wondered if this fact might influence the localization of S-HtrA. In physiological conditions, HtrA is attached to the inner membrane on its periplasmic side [34]. However, we found that following the DTT treatment, more HtrA was present in the soluble protein fraction and approximately 50% of S-HtrA did not copurify with the membranes (data not shown). The biosensor affinity studies showed that SHtrA possessed significantly lower affinity towards the acidic phospholipids, PG and CL, when compared to the full-length HtrA (FL-HtrA), which led to a conclusion that truncated HtrA may be more loosely bound to the membranes. To summarize the presented results, we would like to propose a model of HtrA autocleavage. In physiological

conditions, HtrA contains a disulfide bridge in the Nterminal region, which makes the molecule slightly more compact. In the presence of reducing agents, the S ­ S bridge is disrupted. Subsequently, degradation of a substrate leads to autocatalytical cleavage after Cys69 and Gln82. Similar effect is achieved during degradation of a substrate by the D-Cys HtrA mutant lacking S ­ S bond. This cleavage causes destabilization of the whole hexamer, possibly due to disconnection of the LA loop from the remaining catalytic domain. After prolonged autocleavage, truncated forms of HtrA are released from hexamer and because they show a lower affinity to the membrane, remain in the soluble fraction of the periplasm. The physiological meaning of the autocleavage still remains unclear. One possibility is that in this way, the excess of HtrA is removed from the cell. However, our studies on HtrA stability following chloramphenicol treatment showed that the levels of FL-HtrA and S-HtrA remained rather stable at least for 30 min (data not shown). There is also a possibility that the autocleavage may influence the proteolytic activity of HtrA. Our preliminary results showed that S-HtrA remained fully active; moreover, partially cleaved HtrA was more active towards h-casein than FL-HtrA. Our present work is focused on understanding the physiological role of HtrA autocleavage.
