Tryptophan-Accelerated Electron Flow Through Proteins
Crystal Shih,1 Anna Katrine Museth,1 Malin Abrahamsson,1 Ana Maria Blanco-Rodriguez,2 Angel J. Di Bilio,1 Jawahar Sudhamsu,4 Brian R. Crane,4* Kate L. Ronayne,3 Mike Towrie,3 Antonín Vlcek Jr.,2* John H. Richards,1* Jay R. Winkler,1* Harry B. Gray1*  Energy flow in biological structures often requires submillisecond charge transport over long molecular distances. Kinetics modeling suggests that charge-transfer rates can be greatly enhanced by multistep electron tunneling in which redox-active amino acid side chains act as intermediate donors or acceptors. We report transient optical and infrared spectroscopic experiments that quantify the extent to which an intervening tryptophan residue can facilitate electron transfer between distant metal redox centers in a mutant Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin. CuI oxidation by a photoexcited ReI-diimine at position 124 on a histidine(124)-glycine(123)-tryptophan(122)methionine(121) b strand occurs in a few nanoseconds, fully two orders of magnitude faster than documented for single-step electron tunneling at a 19 angstrom donor-acceptor distance. xtensive experimental and theoretical investigations of iron and copper proteins have explored the factors controlling longrange electron transfer (ET) through folded polypeptide structures (1­10). In work on Rumodified derivatives of Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin, a relatively small blue copper protein (128 residues; b-barrel fold), we found that couplinglimited (activationless) CuI to RuIII ET rates decrease exponentially with distance over a wide range (16 to 26 Å), which demonstrates that these reactions occur by single-step electron tunneling (decay constant, 1.1 Å-1) (2, 11­13). Electron transport over greater distances (>25 Å) likely involves multistep tunneling, often called hopping (10, 14­20), in which redox-active amino acid side chains act as intermediate donors or acceptors rather than tunneling bridges (2, 3, 21). Calculations of hole hopping based on decay constants between 1.0 and 1.2 Å-1, and reorganization energies in the 0.7 to 0.8 eV range, indicate that electrons could be transported 30 Å or more in hundreds of nanoseconds if an intervening redox center (Int) with a reduction potential [E(Int+/0)] well above that of the donor [E(D+/0)] but not more than 200 mV above that of the acceptor [E(A0/-)] is placed between D and A (2, 3). We have expressed three mutant P. aeruginosa azurins to test the proposition that an intervening tryptophan or tyrosine can facilitate electron transfer between distant metal redox centers (22). In these azurins, a histidine (H) ligand is at position 124 on the b strand extending from methionine-

E

121 and either tryptophan (W), tyrosine (Y), or phenylalanine (F) is at position 122 (23, 24). The construction was completed by attaching ReI(CO)3(4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) [ReI(CO)3(dmp)] to H124. ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124) is a powerful oxidant in its triplet metal-toligand charge-transfer (3MLCT) excited state: E°[*ReII(CO)3(dmp· -)(H124)/ReI(CO)3(dmp· -) (H124)] = 1.4 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (25). The x-ray crystal structure of the Re-labeled W122 variant [ReI(CO)3(dmp) (H124)|(W122)|AzCuII] (Fig. 1) shows that dmp and the W122 indole group are near van der Waals contact (~ 4 Å), and the Cu-Re distance is 19.4 Å. Luminescence from electronically excited ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)|(W122)|AzCuI is substantially quenched relative to the F122 analog. Timeresolved luminescence data for the W122 protein reveal a biphasic excited-state decay pattern [t1 = 350(50) ps, t2 = 25(5) ns] (Fig. 2); this pattern contrasts with the single-exponential decay (t = 1.3 ms) of the ReI(CO)3(dmp)|(F122)|AzCuI 3 MLCT state. Transient absorption measurements reveal rapid (<50 ns) formation of CuII after pulsed laser excitation (lobs = 632.8 nm; lex = 355 nm, 8 ns pulsewidth) of ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)| (W122)|AzCuI (Fig. 2); data at 500 nm are con-

sistent with concomitant formation of ReI(CO)3 (dmp· - )(H124); charge recombination to regenerate ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)|(W122)|AzCuI proceeds with a time constant of ~3 ms. No evidence (lobs = 632.8, 500 nm) for AzCuII formation was found after excitation of ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)| (F122)|AzCuI or ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)|(Y122)| AzCuI. Owing to the sensitivity of CO stretching frequencies to the electron density distribution in a metallocarbonyl unit, time-resolved infrared absorption (TRIR) provides structural and kinetics information on both the electronic ground and MLCT-excited states of ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124), as well as on ReI(CO)3(dmp·­ )(H124) (Fig. 2). TRIR spectra measured in the region of CO stretching frequencies show bleaches at 1920 and 2030 cm-1, corresponding to the depleted groundstate population; absorptions at ~1960, 2012, and ~2040 cm-1, characteristic of the 3MLCT excited state (26); and most important, distinct peaks at 1888 and 2004 cm-1, which are spectroscopic signatures of ReI(CO)3(dmp·­)(H124) (27). Both the MLCT and bleach features are fully developed within the instrument response time (<1 ps); the MLCT bands evolve with three time constants [35(15) ps, 350(50) ps, 25(5) ns, measured at frequencies in the range 1950 to 1960 cm-1], and the bleach recovers with ~25 ns and ~3 ms kinetics. A small population (~20%) of ReI(CO)3(dmp·- ) (H124) is present promptly (~1 ps) after excitation; this population continues to grow in three apparent kinetics phases with time constants of 35(15) ps, 350(50) ps, and 25(5) ns, followed by 3 ms decay. TRIR spectra indicate that W122 is required for rapid formation of ReI(CO)3(dmp·­ )(H124): The reduced complex also appears after excitation of ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)|(W122)|AzCuII and ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)|(W122)|AzZnII, but not after excitation of ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)|(Y122)| AzZnII. Nanosecond visible transient absorption experiments confirm that no CuII is formed upon excitation of ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)|(F122)| AzCuI or ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124)|(Y122)|AzCuI at 355 nm. The transient absorption, luminescence, and infrared spectra can be interpreted in terms of the

kinetics model outlined in Fig. 3. Optical excitation of ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124) creates a 1MLCTexcited state, which undergoes ~150 fs intersystem crossing (28) to a vibrationally excited 3 MLCT (*3MLCT) state. Subpicosecond generation of ReI(CO)3(dmp· - )(H124) is attributable to ET from W122 to singlet-excited (1MLCT) ReI(CO)3(dmp)(H124). In previous work, we found that equilibration of the *3MLCT state in ReI(CO)3(phen)(HX)|AzCuII (X = 83, 109), involving both vibrational and surroundingmedium relaxation, proceeds on the 10- to 100-ps time scale (26). Hence, the ~35-ps formation of ReI(CO)3(dmp· - )(H124) in ReI(CO)3(dmp) (H124)|(W122)|AzCuI likely involves parallel relaxation and reduction of the *3MLCT state. The source of reducing equivalents in these fast ET reactions is the indole side chain of W122; no evidence for ReI(CO)3(dmp· - )(H124) formation was observed with proteins containing F122 or Y122 residues. The 350(50)-ps kinetics phase is attributed to equilibration between the 3MLCT state and ReI(CO)3(dmp·-)(H124)|(W122)·+|AzCuI, and the 25(5)-ns process to reduction of (W122)·+ by AzCuI to generate ReI(CO)3(dmp·-)(H124)|(W122)|AzCuII. Ground-state repopulation proceeds in 3 ms by long-range ET from ReI(CO)3(dmp·-)(H124) to AzCuII. To extract rate constants corresponding to elementary reaction steps, we developed a numerical procedure to fit all of the time-resolved data to the rate laws defined by Fig. 3 (22). The transient spectra calculated using this model and the resulting elementary rate constants (Fig. 3) are in excellent agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 2). The key finding is that CuI oxidation in I Re (CO)3(dmp)(H124)|(W122)|AzCuI is more than two orders of magnitude faster than expected for electron tunneling over 19 Å. Our analysis of the reaction kinetics reveals that the reduction potential of *ReII(CO)3(dmp·-)(H124) is just 28 mV greater than that of (W122)·+/0, but this is sufficient for very rapid (~ns) ET between adjacent dmp and W122 aromatic rings (Fig. 1). Replacement of W122 by Y or F inhibits this initial ET event, presumably because the (Y122)·+/0 and (F122)·+/0 reduction potentials are more than 200 mV above E°[*ReII(CO)3(dmp·-) (H124)/Re I(CO) 3(dmp·-)(H124)] (29). Concerted oxidation and deprotonation of Y122 by *ReII(CO)3(dmp·-)(H124) could be thermodynamically favorable, but likely would be accompanied by a significant activation barrier. Tryptophan radical cation is a relatively weak acid [ pKa = 4.5(2)] (30, 31); its deprotonation, which is energetically favorable at pH 7, likely would proceed on a microsecond time scale (17). Hence, (W122)·+ can rapidly oxidize CuI in the azurin active site because it remains protonated in the hopping intermediate. We have employed semiclassical ET theory (22) to generate a hopping map of drivingforce effects on two-step (CuIInt*ML) and single-step (CuI*ML) tunneling rates for a molecular framework analogous to ReI(CO)3 (dmp)(H124)|(W122)|AzCuI (Fig. 4). The specific rate of each elementary ET reaction depends on three parameters: driving force, reorga-

Although endergonic initial steps can still produce an advantage over single-step tunneling, transport time constants increase by roughly one order of magnitude for each 100 meV increase in -DG° (Int*ML). Hence, tunneling through less stable intermediates, although possible, offers neither a kinetic nor an energetic advantage over a reaction involving exergonic tunneling steps. 30. A. Harriman, J.

On the basis of a large body of experimental data, we assume a reorganization energy of 0.8 eV for all ET steps (2, 3). Earlier work has established that the rates of individual tunneling reactions in azurin depend exponentially on the donor-acceptor separation distance, with a decay constant of 1.1 Å-1 (12); rates also depend on driving force [estimated from electrochemical measurements and from the observed *ReII(CO)3(dmp·-)(H124)|(W122)|AzCuI: ReI(CO)3(dmp·-)(H124)|(W122)·+|AzCuI equilibrium constant]. 33.

nization energy, and electronic coupling (the overall advantage of two-step over single-step tunneling depends on seven independent parameters). The horizontal contours in the central part of the hopping map indicate that the overall charge-separation rate is more sensitive to the free-energy change for the first of the two tunneling steps. Indeed, the rate advantage of the multistep process is lost if the first tunneling step is too endergonic [DG°(Int*ML) > 200 meV] (2, 3). Our modeling predicts a 54-ns time constant for CuI oxidation, in good agreement with the experimental value of 31 ns (32). We calculate that twostep hopping is more than 300 times as fast as single-step CuI to *ReII(CO)3(dmp· - )(H124) tunneling. Biological redox machines often require multistep electron-tunneling architectures that can move charges rapidly over long distances with only a small loss of free energy. A hole originating on the Y122 radical in Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase is transferred some 35 Å to the active site, retaining sufficient oxidizing power to generate the C439 radical that initiates conversion of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides (14­16, 20), and the photochemically generated hole in the P680 pigment [E°(P680+·/0) ~ 1.3 V] of the photosynthetic oxygen evolving center is transferred by YZ to the Mn-cluster active site where H2O is oxidized to O2 (E° = 1.23 V) (18, 33). Our modeling demonstrates that the ReI(CO)3(dmp) (H124)|(W122)|AzCuI architecture could provide a suitable framework for an artificial solar energy storage device. The weak dependence of rates on -DG°(CuI*ML) (Fig. 4) confirms

that more than 2 eV can be stored in a photochemical charge-separation process without a substantial sacrifice in rate. We anticipate no change in charge-separation rate constant if, through site-directed mutagenesis, the reduction potential of the blue copper active site in ReII(CO)3(dmp·-)(H124)|(W122)|AzCuI were raised by 0.6 V. If the potential of the copper site were high enough to oxidize water, charge separation would proceed with a 1.4-ms time constant, an improvement by a factor of more than 600 over a direct CuIReII singlestep process.
