Abstract In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (PaBADH) may play the dual role of assimilating carbon and nitrogen from choline or choline precursors--abundant at infection sites--and producing glycine betaine, which protects the bacterium against the high-osmolality stress prevalent in the infected tissues. This tetrameric enzyme contains four cysteine residues per subunit and is a potential drug target. In our search for specific inhibitors, we mutated the catalytic Cys286 to alanine and chemically modified the recombinant wild-type and the four Cys fi Ala single mutants with thiol reagents. The small methyl-methanethiosulfonate inactivated the enzymes without affecting their stability while the bulkier dithionitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) and bis[diethylthiocarbamyl] disulfide (disulfiram) induced enzyme dissociation--at 23 °C--and irreversible aggregation--at 37 °C. Of the four Cys fi Ala mutants only C286A retained its tetrameric structure after DTNB or disulfiram treatments, suggesting that steric constraints arising upon the covalent attachment of a bulky group to C286 resulted in distortion of the backbone configuration in the active site region followed by a severe decrease in enzyme stability. Since neither NAD(P)H nor betaine aldehyde prevented disulfiram-induced PaBADH inactivation or aggregation, and reduced glutathione was unable to restore the activity of the modified enzyme, we propose that disulfiram could be a useful drug to combat infection by P. aeruginosa.

ity to infection in the increasingly immuno-depressed population. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can grow in an extensive variety of compounds and habitats, seeming to be practically ubiquitous. Significantly, it can grow in choline, or choline precursors--abundant in infected tissues [1­3]--as its only carbon, nitrogen, and energy source [4]. An obligatory step in the catabolism of these compounds by P. aeruginosa is the irreversible, NAD(P)+-dependent oxidation of betaine aldehyde catalyzed by betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (betaine aldehyde: NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.8; BADH) [4,5]. In P. aeruginosa, the gene encoding this

enzyme is induced by choline, even in the presence of other carbon sources such as glucose [5], a finding which suggests that PaBADH activity is indeed present in bacteria infecting human tissues. Glycine betaine--the acid product of the BADH catalyzed reaction--is an effective osmoprotectant [6], and most likely acts as such in bacterial cells growing in the hyperosmotic environment of infected tissues [7] for it has been found that P. aeruginosa is able to thrive under osmotic stress if glycine betaine or compounds that produce glycine betaine--choline or choline precursors--are present [8]. Indeed, the virulence of this bacterium has been correlated with its ability to adapt to osmotic stress and to express phospholipase C [9,10]--the first enzyme in the pathway from phosphatidylcholine to glycine betaine. BADH from P. aeruginosa (PaBADH) therefore might be a key enzyme in the establishment and growth of the pathogen and thus a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents. Validation of this enzyme as a suitable target for antimicrobial agents comes from the finding that bacteria with a disrupted badh gene cannot grow in glucose under osmotic stress conditions if choline is present in the growth medium [11]. The authors of this work suggested that growth inhibition is due to the accumulation of the BADH substrate, betaine aldehyde, which is highly toxic [12]. Every aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) known to date has an essential cysteine residue that forms a covalent bond with the aldehyde substrate during catalysis. Alignment of

the PaBADH sequence with other ALDH sequences indicates that C286 is the strictly conserved cysteine residue and therefore the catalytic one. As at neutral pH thiols are the most reactive groups in proteins, and the catalytic cysteine residue of PaBADH is particularly highly reactive [13], specific thiol reagents aimed at its chemical modification could be effective inhibitors of this enzyme. We have previously shown that PaBADH is inactivated in a timeand dose-dependent fashion by thiol reagents [13,14], most likely as a consequence of the chemical modification of the catalytic cysteine. But each subunit of this tetrameric [15] enzyme contains three cysteine residues--C353, 377, and 439--in addition of the essential, catalytic C286. These three residues were individually mutated to alanine and found not to be essential for enzyme activity. C439, however, plays an important role in the maintenance of the native tetrameric structure [16]. In this work, with the aim of exploring (1) the feasibility of using the catalytic, or another cysteine, residue of PaBADH as a target for irreversible chemical modification, and (2) the potentiality of using thiol reagents to counteract infection by this pathogen, we examined the effects on the native enzyme structure of reagents that react rapidly and specifically with protein thiols introducing groups of differing size and charge into the protein--methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS), dithionitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), and bis[diethylthiocarbamyl] disulfide (disulfiram) (Scheme 1). We were particularly interested in investigating the effects of disulfiram--an

´ R. Velasco-Garcia et al. / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 341 (2006) 408­415 The kinetics of inactivation of PaBADH (300 lg/ml, 5 lM as subunit) by 50 lM DSF at 37 °C in the absence and presence of ligands were determined in buffer B. At specified times, samples were removed from incubations and the residual enzyme activity determined by the standard assay. Pseudo-first order analysis of the inactivation kinetics was performed by non-linear regression. Reactivation of the PaBADH enzymes, which were totally inactivated by DTNB- or DSF-treatments in buffer B for 12 h at 23 °C or 2 h at 37 °C, was performed with 2.5 mM DTT or 5 mM GSH. The recovery of enzyme activity was followed over time. Size-exclusion chromatography. The association state of the chemically modified enzymes was estimated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), connected to a high-pressure chromatography system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The column was equilibrated and eluted at room temperature with buffer A or B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution was monitored by following absorbance at 280 nm. Before chromatography all samples were filtered (membrane-pore diameter 0.22 lm) or centrifuged to eliminate large aggregates. Protein aggregation studies. To estimate the amount of aggregated protein formed, enzyme samples treated with the modifying reagent at 37 °C for 2 h were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 rpm in an Allegra 64 R (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA, USA) bench-top centrifuge at 4 °C. The soluble PaBADH protein remaining was measured by absorbance at 280 nm of the supernatant. Turbidimetry was used to obtain information on the kinetics of the aggregation of the disulfiram- and DTNB-treated enzymes. Measurements of absorbance as a function of time were performed in a DU 7000 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA, USA) at 450 nm and 37 °C. The samples were rigorously mixed using a vortex for 30 s before each measurement. To determine the hydrophobic surface exposed by the enzyme during and after disulfiram modification, PaBADH samples were incubated in buffer B for 2 h at 37 °C with 50 lM disulfiram in the presence of a 20-fold excess of ANS. A RF 5000U spectrofluorimeter (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and a 1-cm quartz cuvette were used. The intensity for the ANS fluorescence emission was registered at 486.4 nm with excitation at 370 nm. The excitation and emission slits were set at 5 nm.

approved drug that has been long used to treat alcoholism [17,18] and, more recently, has been suggested to be of potential use in both treating cocaine dependency [19,20] and in clinical oncology [21­25]. To be able to unequivocally ascribe the effects of disulfiram to the modification of one or several of the PaBADH cysteinyl residues, we constructed the C286A mutant and subjected the four Cys fi Ala PaBADH mutants to chemical modification. We report here that, by reacting with the thiolate group of C286, bulky thiol reagents destabilized the quaternary structure and promoted irreversible enzyme aggregation, not prevented by NADP(H) or betaine aldehyde. These results suggest that disulfiram could be a clinically useful drug to combat infection by P. aeruginosa. Materials and methods
Materials. Betaine aldehyde chloride, dithiothreitol (DTT), reduced glutathione (GSH), 2-mercaptoethanol, EDTA, NADP+ (sodium salt), disulfiram, and 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) were obtained ´ ´ from Sigma­Aldrich Quimica, S.A. de C.V. (Toluca, Mexico). All other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. Site-directed mutagenesis. To construct the PaBADH C286A mutant, FW (5 0 CTC CGG CCA GGT CGC GAC CAA CGG CACC 3 0 ) and RV (5 0 GGT GCC GTT GGT CGC GAC CTG GCC GGAG 3 0 ) oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were used. Mutagenesis was performed with the Quikchange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions and using the pCALbetB plasmid [5] as DNA template. The Escherichia coli strains XL1-blue and BL21(DE3) pLysS were transformed with the mutated plasmid [5]. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing the mutated gene in an automatic sequencer (ABI Prism 310 Molecular Analyzer, Applied Biosystems). Expression and purification of recombinant wild-type and mutant PaBADHs. The wild-type and the four Cys fi Ala mutant PaBADHs-- C286A, C353A, C377A, and C439A--were expressed in E. coli cells as reported [5,16] and purified to homogeneity following the two-step procedure described [16]. The structural integrity of the C286A mutant was assessed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism. Spectra were recorded as described [16]. The molar concentrations of wildtype and mutant PaBADHS were determined by the technique of Bradford [26], or spectrophotometrically, using a molar absorptivity at 280 nm of 52,060 MÀ1 cmÀ1, deduced from the amino acid sequence by the method of Gill and von Hippel [27]. Enzyme assay and chemical modification. PaBADH activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 30 °C, by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm in a mixture (0.5 ml) consisting of 1.0 mM betaine aldehyde, 0.3 mM NADP+, and 1 mM EDTA in 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0 (standard assay). Chemical modification of wild-type and mutant PaBADH samples was carried out at 23 or 37 °C with the following thiol reagents: 0.4 mM DTNB, 5 lM MMTS, and 50 lM disulfiram. Previous to chemical modification, the enzyme preparations (300 lg/ml, 5 lM as subunit) were freed of 2-mercaptoethanol--used during storage of the enzyme--by quick gel filtration in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA (buffer A), or in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, containing 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM KCl, and 10% (v:v) glycerol (buffer B). Each sample was subjected to three runs of gel filtration and then the chemical modification was carried out in the same buffer by adding the appropriate amounts of the thiol reagent tested. All solutions used were degassed and saturated with nitrogen just before use to prevent air oxidation of the PaBADH cysteine residues. The enzyme was completely stable at 0 °C for 72 h after removal of 2-mercaptoethanol under anaerobic conditions. The stock solutions of MMTS (50 lM), DTNB (100 mM), and disulfiram (5 mM) were prepared in absolute ethanol.

Results and discussion Site-directed mutagenesis of C286 Alignment of the BADH sequences currently available in the data banks (not shown) indicated that C286 (P. aeruginosa numbering) is the only cysteine residue strictly conserved. This suggests that this residue is the active site nucleophile that attacks the aldehyde substrate during catalysis, forming the thiohemiacetal intermediate. To confirm this, and to explore the feasibility of using this thiol group as a target for specific chemical modification, we constructed the C286A mutant. This mutant PaBADH showed complete cross-reactivity with polyclonal antiserum raised against the wild-type enzyme [28] (results not shown). The mutant was expressed at a level comparable with that of the wild-type, as assessed by SDS­PAGE and immunoblot analysis of cell-free extracts (results not shown). It was successfully purified to homogeneity using the previously reported two-step procedure employed with the native BADH [16]; the yield was 23 mg of pure enzyme per liter of culture. The purified mutant C286A PaBADH was completely devoid of activity, thus confirming the essentiality of this residue.

mutant (not shown) had an identical peak at 335 nm. Similarly, the CD spectra of both enzymes were super-imposable within experimental error (not shown). Both results indicate that the mutation has no major effects on secondary or tertiary structure. Effect of thiol reagents on the association state of PaBADH We have previously shown that thiol reagents inactivate PaBADH in a time- and dose-dependent fashion [13,14], most likely as a consequence of the chemical modification of the highly reactive thiol group of the catalytic cysteine residue, C286. To find out whether thiol modification has an additional effect on PaBADH stability, we examined the oligomeric structure of the wild-type enzyme by SEC after treatment with compounds that react rapidly and specifically with protein thiols but introduce groups of differing size and charge into the protein--MMTS, disulfiram, and DTNB (Scheme 1). At pH 8.0 and 23 °C, the total inactivation of wildtype PaBADH (2 mg/ml) by chemical modification with the bulky thiol reagent DTNB for 2 h in buffer A caused an important proportion of the native tetramers to dissociate into monomers. Dimers were not observed (Fig. 1A). Given the high reactivity of the PaBADH catalytic thiol group, even at neutral pH [13], it is reasonable to expect that it is more susceptible to chemical modification than the other three cysteinyl residues. The homology model of PaBADH shows that C353 and C377 are located at the protein surface but their sulfur atoms are buried and therefore not accessible to the solvent [16]. C439 is at the subunit interface between the monomers forming a dimeric pair so its mutation results in destabilization of the quaternary structure [16]. The modification of C439 by DTNB could lead, therefore, to enzyme dissociation. To unequivocally establish which of the cysteinyl residues destabilizes the tetrameric native structure when chemically modified, we subjected the four Cys fi Ala PaBADH mutants to chemical modification by DTNB under identical conditions--pH 8.0, 23 °C--to those used with the wild-type enzyme. Of the four mutants, only C286A maintained its tetrameric structure after this treatment (Fig. 1B), whereas C353A and C377A dissociated in a proportion similar to that of the wild-type (not shown) and C439A completely dissociated into monomers (Fig. 1C), consistent with its low stability [16]. These results indicate that active site rearrangements provoked by the DTNB-modification of C286--the catalytic cysteine--propagate to the interface between subunits resulting in overall tetramer instability. As the MMTS-inactivated wild-type enzyme conserved its tetrameric structure even 48 h after inactivation was complete (not shown), the DTNB-induced enzyme dissociation was not caused by chemical modification of the catalytic thiolate, but by steric constraints derived from the attachment of a bulky and/or charged S­R group to the essential thiolate.

Fig. 1. Effect of DTNB treatment at 23 °C on the oligomeric state of wildtype and mutant PaBADHs. The enzymes (2 mg/ml) were incubated for 2 h without (solid lines) or with 0.4 mM DTNB (dotted lines) in buffer A. The SEC elution profiles of the wild-type (A), C286A (B), and C439A (C) mutants are shown.

The results with DTNB prompted us to investigate whether chemical modification by another bulky, hydrophobic, uncharged thiol reagent--the clinically used drug disulfiram, which is known to inactivate PaBADH [14]-- would also affect the native tetrameric structure of the enzyme. Enzyme modification by disulfiram was carried out at both 23 and 37 °C in buffer B--at pH 6.9 which is near physiological. Similar to the previous results obtained with DTNB, the wild-type PaBADH inactivated by 2 h incubation at 23 °C with 50 lM disulfiram was a mixture of tetramers and monomers (Fig. 2A). To simulate conditions of infection, we next investigated the stability of the enzyme when modified at 37 °C under otherwise identical conditions to the ones at 23 °C. Visible aggregates of very high molecular weight formed, indicating that the chemically modified tetramers and/or monomers are very unstable. Only about 5% of the initial wild-type protein remained as tetramers, as indicated by the absorption at 280 nm of the centrifuged samples and by the reduction in the area under the SEC elution profile peaks (Fig. 2A).

Previous to SEC the enzyme aggregates formed at 37 °C were removed by centrifugation.

(C) Disulfiram-induced changes in ANS fluorescence of wild-type (closed squares) and C286A mutant (open squares) PaBADHs. Incubation conditions were as in (B) except that 100 lM ANS was present throughout the incubation. Lines through the data points in (B,C) do not represent a curve fit but are presented to guide the eye. In all experiments, enzyme concentration was 0.3 mg/ml (5 lM as subunit).

Monomers were not observed, most likely because they readily form the high-molecular weight aggregates. The control, non-treated PaBADH remained as tetramers after incubation at 37 °C in buffer B for the same amount of time (Fig. 2A). The ability of the thiol reagents to induce PaBADH aggregation at 37 °C was assessed by measuring the turbidometry of treated protein samples. An increase in absorbance at 450 nm was observed in the wild-type PaBADH sample treated with DTNB, and an even greater increase in that treated with disulfiram. Neither the MMTS-treated nor the untreated enzymes showed any increase in absorbance when incubated under the same conditions and for the same period of time (Fig. 2B). Disulfiram-induced aggregation of PaBADH at 37 °C was studied also by monitoring changes in the emission of the fluorescent probe ANS during the time-course of modification. ANS is virtually non-fluorescent in a polar solvent and exhibits a significant increase in quantum yield when binding to hydrophobic regions on proteins [29]. Differences in ANS fluorescence intensities can therefore be correlated with changes in the enzyme quaternary structure. The emission profile of the disulfiram-treated wildtype PaBADH in the presence of ANS (Fig. 2C) is similar to the absorbance profile obtained in the turbidometry experiments in the absence of the fluorophore. Both profiles are characterized by features that are typically assigned to a nucleation-dependent aggregation mechanism, including a lag phase that is followed by a sigmoidal-like increase to a fluorescence plateau. Given the hydrophobic nature of the dye, the more favorable interaction of ANS with the disulfiram-induced PaBADH aggregates indicates an increased overall surface hydrophobicity. The almost constant fluorescence observed with the C286A mutant (Fig. 2C) again indicates that disulfiram did not cause any structural alteration in the enzyme if the catalytic thiolate is not modified. SDS (4% w:v) completely dissolved the enzyme aggregates formed by treatment with disulfiram, as assessed by the re-appearance of the soluble protein--determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm of the supernatants of centrifuged samples--after 12 h of the addition of the detergent (not shown). Since DTT was not present, this result indicates that aggregation is not due to formation of disulfide bridges between the disulfiram-treated PaBADH molecules but rather to non-covalent--most likely hydrophobic--interactions. Comparison of the kinetics of the disulfiram-induced PaBADH inactivation and aggregation at 37 °C. Effect of ligands on these kinetics In order to obtain information on the kinetics of the disulfiram-induced aggregation of PaBADH at 37 °C, and to investigate whether they correlate with the kinetics of inactivation, we measured the activity and turbidometry of treated protein samples as a function of time.

previously found in experiments carried out at 23 °C [14], disulfiram caused a total loss of enzyme activity in a first order process. The observed pseudo-first order rate constant of 0.281 ± 0.038 minÀ1 is 14 times higher than that observed at 23 °C, and its value was not significantly changed by the presence of NADP+ (0.247 ± 0.028 minÀ1) or betaine aldehyde (0.291 ± 0.031 minÀ1) in the inactivation medium (Fig. 3A). Inactivation was complete after %45 min of incubation--a time at which aggregation has not yet taken place to any significant extent (Fig. 3B). Thus, enzyme aggregation is a much slower process than enzyme inactivation and follows the chemical modification

of the enzyme. As in inactivation, neither the rate nor the extent of aggregation was affected by the presence of the PaBADH substrates. The lack of protection by both substrate and NADP+ is of particular interest, as PaBADH follows a random kinetic mechanism [30] and it is most likely that a significant fraction of PaBADH molecules in vivo--if not all--has the nucleotide or the aldehyde bound. Mechanism of the irreversible inactivation of PaBADH by disulfiram The mechanism of enzyme inhibition by disulfiram involves the formation of a thiocarbamate­thiol derivative with a cysteine residue [31], as shown in Scheme 1. The lack of changes in the quaternary structure of the C286A mutant treated with bulky thiol reagents, together with the dissociation observed in the other treated Cys mutants, indicated that the observed structural changes are due to the chemical modification of the catalytic cysteine. The homology model of PaBADH [16] shows that there is no other cysteine residue close enough to the catalytic one to form an intra-molecular disulfide bridge via a disulfide-interchange reaction, concluding that only the mixed disulfide is formed. On the contrary, inactivation of liver mitochondrial ALDH2 by disulfiram--which causes accumulation of acetaldehyde and results in the effects called the ``disulfiram-ethanol reaction''--involves formation of an intra-subunit disulfide bridge between the catalytic and a vicinal cysteine residue [32,33]. Formation of an intra-molecular disulfide has also been reported to occur after DSF treatment of the ALDH1 enzyme [34]. The different modification elicited by disulfiram in these enzymes may be the reason why ALDH2 does not lose its tetrameric structure when modified by disulfiram [35,36] while PaBADH does. The mixed disulfide may be reversed by a disulfide exchange reaction with physiological or non-physiological thiols, but this depends on chemical and steric factors such as: (i) the stability of the mixed disulfide bond, i.e., its susceptibility to cleavage by free thiols; (ii) the acidity of the protein thiol group involved in the mixed disulfide, which is essential for making it a good leaving group in thioldisulfide exchange reactions with free thiols [37]; and (iii) the accessibility of the mixed disulfide to thiols in the solvent. When the inactivation was performed at 37 °C, after the very high molecular weight aggregates had formed, both 5 mM GSH or 2.5 mM DTT was unable to restore the activity of the disulfiram-treated enzyme to any extent (not shown). But even at 23 °C, when enzyme aggregates did not form, 5 mM GSH--a physiological concentration in P. aeruginosa cells [38]--cannot restore the activity of the disulfiram-inactivated PaBADH to any extent, under conditions in which 2.5 mM DTT does (not shown). This result confirms previous findings obtained with ALDH1 [34] and BADHs [14]. The reactivation with DTT together with the ability of GSH to fully restore the activity of the

MMTS-inactivated PaBADH (not shown) indicates that the mixed disulfide bond formed upon disulfiram modification of the enzyme is fully accessible to the solvent. It is also possible that the pKa of the thiol group of C286 is higher than that of the leaving thiol group of disulfiram, so that GSH displaces the latter and forms a C286-GSH mixed disulfide, which results in an equally inactive enzyme. This is highly improbable, however, as the thiol group of C286 has a pKa of only 4 [13], much lower than that of GSH, which is 9.0 [39]. The most likely explanation for the failure of GSH to revert the disulfiram modification of PaBADH and other ALDHs is that the reduction potential of GSH is not low enough to act as an electron donor and reduce the mixed disulfide formed. This is consistent with the high nucleophilicity of the active site cysteine, which might stabilize the disulfide bond and protect it from the nucleophilic attack of GSH. Although the reactivation by GSH of the MMTS-inactivated enzyme argues against this possibility, it cannot be ruled out as the reduction potential of a mixed disulfide is also influenced by non-covalent interactions between the molecules forming the disulfide [37]. The irreversible structural changes also took place in the DSF-inactivated PaBADH when the modification was carried out at 23 °C, although at a much slower rate than at 37 °C. This is indicated by the finding that the degree of maximum reactivation by DTT decreased as the time elapsed between inactivation and treatment with the reductant increases (Fig. 4). As found in the experiments at 37 °C, NADP+ did not prevent the irreversible structural

changes but slowed down the rate at which they took place (Fig. 4). The estimated half-times, t1/2, for these changes were 24.2 ± 1.6 and 45.7 ± 1.9 h in the absence and presence of the dinucleotide, respectively. Concluding remarks Assuming that PaBADH could be a suitable target for killing or attenuating the growth of P. aeruginosa in a medium in which both high-salt concentrations and choline or choline precursors are present, our results suggest that chemically modifying the essential cysteinyl residue with disulfiram might be an effective strategy against this bacterium. The use of thiol reagents as drugs can, however, lead to severe adverse consequences by irreversibly modifying dozens of thiol proteins in the host, and therefore it is necessary to achieve a very high level of specificity for the desired target protein. Disulfiram appears to have the desired specificity as it has been widely used for years in the aversion treatment of alcoholism without severe effects, other than those called ``the disulfiram-ethanol reaction''-- headache, flushing, dizziness, vomiting, blurred vision, and hypotension [18]--which can be prevented by avoiding ingestion of ethanol. That PaBADH could be effectively and irreversibly inactivated in vivo by disulfiram is supported by its high in vitro sensitivity to this drug, the irreversibility of the disulfiram-induced PaBADH structural changes at physiological temperature, and the inability of NAD(P)+ to prevent, or even decrease, the chemical modification and the accompanying structural changes. In addition, our results--showing the potential impact of targeting the active site of PaBADH with bulky thiol reagents--pave the way for future development of other compounds that may be clinically useful in combating the bacterium.

Fig. 4. Ability of DTT to reactivate the disulfiram-treated enzymes in the absence (closed squares) or presence of 300 lM NADP+ (open squares) at progressively longer periods of times after inactivation with 50 lM disulfiram was completed. At the indicated time periods after inactivation, the enzymes were treated with 10 mM DTT for 90 min and their recovery of activity was measured. The lines represent the best fit of the data to the equation for single exponential decay obtained by non-linear regression. Enzyme concentration was 0.3 mg/ml (5 lM as subunit).
