ABSTRACT The stability of the dodecameric Listeria monocytogenes Dps has been compared with that of the Listeria innocua protein. The two proteins differ only in two amino acid residues that form an intersubunit salt-bridge in L. innocua Dps. This salt-bridge is replaced by a hydrogen bonding network in L. monocytogenes Dps as revealed by the X-ray crystal structure. The resistance to low pH and high temperature was assayed for both Dps proteins under equilibrium conditions and kinetically. Despite the identical equilibrium behavior, significant differences in the kinetic stability and activation energy of the unfolding process are apparent at pH 1.5. The higher stability of L. monocytogenes Dps has been accounted for in terms of the persistence of the hydrogen bonding network at this low pH value. In contrast, the salt-bridge between Lys 114 and Asp 126 characteristic of L. innocua Dps is most likely abolished due to protonation of Asp 126. C Proteins 2007;66:975­983. V 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: L. monocytogenes Dps; L. innocua Dps; pH stability; X-ray crystallography; multimeric proteins INTRODUCTION The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of monomeric proteins has been studied in great detail and the relevant structural determinants were identified. In contrast, little information is available on the stability of multimeric proteins where the thermal unfolding transition is accompanied by an irreversible step. Despite the inherent difficulties encountered in the treatment and analysis of the equilibrium behavior of such systems, studies on multimeric proteins can provide important insight into the relative contribution of the various forces that stabilize the oligomeric structures. Measurement of the unfolding kinetics may allow one to establish whether a given system may gain relevant stabilization by raising the kinetic barriers between the native state and the partially denatured state(s).1,2 This type of information is of particular importance for multimeric

proteins designed to operate under stress conditions and characterized by an intrinsically high stability. Further, in those systems that are prone to aggregation the kinetic aspects of the unfolding process are of special relevance since protein aggregation can lead to serious disorders in the crowded cellular environment.3,4 The members of the DNA-binding protein from starved cells (Dps) family5,6 are bacterial stress-induced proteins characterized by a conserved, symmetrical structure endowed with a high temperature stability, a property exploited currently during their purification.7 Dps proteins are dodecamers constituted by identical four-helix bundle subunits that assemble with tetrahedral 23 symmetry into a hollow sphere.8,9 The assembled molecule can be envisaged as four trimers placed at the vertices of a tetrahedron such that three twofold axes pass through the centers of the tetrahedron edge and the center of the molecule and four threefold axes pass through the vertices of the tetrahedron and the centers of the opposite face. Therefore, two types of interaction are established by the three-fold symmetry related subunits: the interactions at the vertices of the tetrahedron define the so-called ``ferritin-like'' interface since they resemble those established along the threefold symmetry axes in the 24-mer of ferritins.9,10 The other type of interaction is specific to the Dps family and defines the so-called ``Dps-like'' interface. Within the Dps family, the proteins from Listeria innocua and from the facultative pathogen Listeria monocytogenes11 (LiDps and LmDps, respectively) differ only in

two amino acid residues such that LmDps can be considered a natural mutant of the former protein. In LiDps these two residues, Lys 114 and Asp 126, form a salt bridge on the molecular surface at the ``ferritin-like'' interface as shown by the high resolution X-ray crystal structure.9 In LmDps this salt bridge can not be formed since Lys 114 and Asp 126 are substituted with uncharged polar residues, Gln 114 and Asn 126, respectively. The study of LiDps and LmDps therefore can provide information on the role of surface charges in conferring stability to multimeric proteins and in addition offers the unique possibility to assess the contribution of a single salt bridge. The LiDps dodecameric assembly is endowed not only with high thermal stability, but also with an unusual resistance at low pH.12 Thus, the dodecameric structure is preserved at pH 2.0, a property attributed to the presence of an extended network of intersubunit hydrophobic interactions.12 To our knowledge, there is only one report on LmDps stability based on gel filtration experiments that is indicative of a hexameric assembly at physiological pH values,13 in marked contrast with the unusual stability of LiDps and of the other members of the family.12,14 In the present work, the X-ray crystal structure of ° LmDps was obtained at 2.3 A resolution, as a prerequisite to the stability study. Apart from localized modifications in the immediate vicinity of the two mutated residues, the LiDps and LmDps structures are completely superimposable. The study of the stability towards low pH values shows that the double mutation Lys 114 ? Gln, Asp 126 ? Asn does not alter the protein association state(s) at equilibrium, but increases significantly the kinetic stability. To arrive at the identification of the factors involved, the unfolding rates at low pH values of LiDps and LmDps were compared with those of the single mutants K114Q and D126N. The data indicate that stability is conferred through optimization of surface electrostatics and of hydrogen bonding and protein-solvent interactions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Construction The L. monocytogenes frm gene was obtained by sitedirected mutagenesis using as template the pET-11a vector containing the L. innocua fri gene.15 The Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce consecutively the Lys 114 ? Gln and Asp 126 ? Asn mutations that convert the amino acid sequence of LiDps into the LmDps one. The single

mutants K114Q and D126N were obtained with the same strategy. The oligonucleotides used are shown in Table I. Protein Purification and Characterization LiDps, the single mutants K114Q and D126N, and the double mutant K114Q-D126N, hereafter called LmDps, were over-expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). All the proteins were purified using the protocol described by Ilari et al.16 Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorptivity of 2.59 3 105 MÀ1 at 280 nm based on a dodecamer molecular mass of 216 kDa.7 The iron content, determined by the ferrozine assay (Fluka), was $2.0 Fe/dodecamer for all the proteins studied. Protein Crystallization Crystallization of LmDps was achieved at 293 K by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. A 2.0 lL volume of the protein sample (32.0 lM), equilibrated against 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 200 mM NaCl, was mixed with an equal amount of the reservoir solution containing 0.1 M HEPES buffer at pH values between 7.0 and 8.5 and PEG 400 in the range of 15­30% (w/v). The crystals grew in one week. Data Collection and Processing Data were collected as 0.5 oscillation frames using the MAR CCD detector on the X-ray beamline at ELETTRA, ° Basovizza (Trieste, Italy) at a wavelength of 1.2 A. Data were collected at 100 K. The data analysis, performed with DENZO17 indicates that the crystal belongs to the ° monoclinic space group (space group P21; a ¼ 89.2 A, ° ° b ¼ 172.7 A, c ¼ 135.3 A, b ¼ 92.18). The data were scaled using SCALEPACK17; the data scaling statistics are presented in Table II. Structure Solution and Refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement using as search probe native LiDps (RCSB entry 1qgh). The rotational and translational searches, performed with the program Molrep18 in the resolution range of ° 10­3.0 A, produced clear solutions. Refinement of the atomic coordinates and of the displacement parameters was carried out by the maximum likelihood method with the program REFMAC.19 The refinement statistics are presented in Table II.

Spectroscopic Techniques Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter at 208C. Far-UV (200­250 nm) CD spectra were recorded either at a protein concentration of 80.0 lg/mL in a 0.1 cm cuvette or of 25.0 lg/mL in a 1.0 cm cuvette; near-UV (250­320 nm) CD spectra were recorded at a protein concentration of 0.8 mg/mL in a 1.0 cm cuvette. The results are expressed as molar ellipticity assuming a mean residue weight per amino acid of 110. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a LS50B PerkinElmer spectrofluorimeter between 300 and 450 nm on protein samples at 40.0 lg/mL with the excitation wavelength set at 295 nm. pH Jump Experiments All protein samples were dialyzed against 5.0 mM NaH2PO4­Na2HPO4, pH 7.0. Protein solutions were diluted 100-fold into 31.6 mM HCl (pH 1.5) at 208C and changes in the CD and emission fluorescence spectra were recorded as a function of time. Near-UV (0.8 mg/ mL) and far-UV (25.0 lg/mL) CD spectra were recorded at 208C in a 1.0-cm cuvette under continuous stirring with scan rates and response of 100 nm/min and 125 ms, and 200 nm/min and 64 ms, respectively. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 370 nm on protein samples at 40.0 lg/mL with the excitation wavelength set at 295 nm. The mixing dead-time was calculated by diluting N-acetyl-tryptophanamide under the same conditions; it was always between 2 and 3 s. Data Analysis Far- and near-UV CD spectra recorded as a function of time were analyzed by a singular value decomposition algorithm (SVD) using the software MATLAB (MathWorks, South Natick, MA) to remove the high frequency noise and the low frequency random errors and determine the number of independent components in any given set of spectra. CD spectra in the 200­250 nm region or in the 250­320 nm region were placed in a rectangular matrix A of n columns, one column for each spectrum collected at each time. The A matrix is decomposed by SVD into the product of three matrices: A ¼ USVT, where U and V are orthogonal matrices and S is a diagonal matrix. The U matrix columns contain the basis spectra and the V matrix columns contain the Hþ concentration- and time-dependence of each basis spectrum. Both U and V columns are arranged in terms of decreasing order of the relative weight of information, as indicated by the magnitude of the singular values in S. The diagonal S matrix contains the singular values that quantify the relative importance of each vector in U and V. The signal-to-noise ratio is very high in the earliest columns of U and V while the random noise is

molecules were added manually using the Fo­Fc map ° contoured at 3r when the B factor was less than 50 A2 and/or the maximum distance from any given residue ° was less than 5 A. The water molecules were added when Rfree was <30%. The quality of the model was assessed by the program PROCHECK.21 The PDB accession code of the structure is 2IY4. Determination of the Association State as a Function of pH The protein samples were incubated (0.8 mg/mL) for 24 h at pH 7.0 (20.0 mM NaH2PO4­Na2HPO4), pH 2.0 (10.0 mM HCl), pH 1.5 (31.6 mM HCl), and pH 1.0 (100.0 mM HCl) at 208C. The pH of the solutions was measured with an InLab422 electrode (Mettler-Toledo AG) connected to a Corning P507 ion meter before and after addition of the protein. Analysis of the association state was carried out by means of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments at 208C on a Superose12 column (Pharmacia) eluted with 20 mM NaH2PO4­ Na2HPO4, pH 7.0 containing 0.15 M NaCl at a flow rate ¨ of 0.5 mL/min controlled by an AKTA gradient pump. After 24 h incubation at the desired pH, the samples (0.8 mg/ mL) were diluted 20-fold into the column injection loop. The Superose12 column was calibrated with horse spleen apoferritin (440 kDa, elution volume Ve ¼ 9.3 mL), rabbit muscle aldolase (161 kDa, elution volume Ve ¼ 11.2 mL), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, elution

mainly accumulated in the latest U and V columns. The wavelength averaged spectral changes induced by the pH jump as a function of time are represented by the columns of matrix V, hence the plot of the columns of V versus time provides information about such changes. Thermal Denaturation Experiments The protein samples (25.0 lg/mL) after a 24 h incubation in 20.0 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0, 20.0 mM glycineHCl, pH 3.0, or 10.0 mM HCl, pH 2.0 were heated from 208C to 958C with a heating rate of 1 degree minÀ1 controlled by a Jasco programmable Peltier element. The dichroic activity at 222 nm was monitored continuously every 0.58C. All the thermal scans were corrected for the solvent contribution at the different temperatures. Melting temperature (Tm) values were calculated by taking the first derivative of the ellipticity at 222 nm with respect to temperature. All denaturation experiments were performed in triplicate. LiDps was always used as a control. RESULTS Structural Characterization of L. monocytogenes Dps in the Crystal and in Solution The X-ray crystal structure of LmDps, obtained as the ° LiDps double mutant K114Q-D126N, was solved at 2.3 A resolution. The LmDps monomer consists of a four-helix (A­D) bundle, with a small helix (BC) in the loop connecting helices B and C, stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1). The superposition of the LmDps monomer on the LiDps one yields very small root mean ° square deviations (0.24 A) indicating that the two structures are very similar. A small difference concerns the Gln 115 and Glu 118 side chains, which in LmDps are rotated by about 908 and 308, respectively, relative to LiDps. In the LmDps dodecamer, the ``Dps-like'' interface has ° a similar buried surface area as in LiDps (about 800 A2/ monomer) and likewise contains two hydrogen bonds ° involving His 37 and Asn 38 (distance 3.0 A) and Gly 36 ° and Ala 148 (distance 3.0 A). The ``ferritin-like'' interface comprises the CD loop, the beginning of the D helix and the last part of the B helix (Fig. 1); it has a somewhat ° larger buried surface area than in LiDps (889 vs. 870 A2/ monomer) and is stabilized by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions as in the other members of the Dps family. With the exception of the salt-bridge between Lys 114 and Asp 126, all the hydrophilic interactions stabilizing the LiDps interface are conserved, that is, the salt bridge between Lys 141 and Glu 62 (NZ ° - OE1 distance 2.8 A) and that between Arg 63 and Asp ° 140 (NH2­OD1 distance 3.0 A). In LmDps the Lys 114­ ° Asp 126 salt bridge of LiDps (NZ­OD2 distance 2.5 A) is substituted by a hydrogen bonding network which involves Gln 114, Glu 118, Lys 136, Asp 140 of one subunit, Arg 63, Asp 125, and Asn 126 of the threefold symmetry related subunit and two water molecules, wA and wB (Fig. 1). Water molecule wA acts as a pivot since it bridges Gln 114 and Asn 126 through two H-bonds (disPROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

° tance wA À Gln 114 OE2 ¼ 2.44 A and wA À Asn 126 ° ND2 ¼ 2.95 A) and forms an additional H-bond with ° water molecule wB (distance wA À wB ¼ 2.26 A). In turn, wB forms three H-bonds with Arg 63, Asp 125, ° and Lys 136, respectively (distance wB À Arg 63 ¼ 3.58 A, ° ° wB À Asp 125 ¼ 2.82 A, and wB À Lys 136 ¼ 3.27 A). An additional H-bond connects the Glu 118 carboxylate and the amino group of Gln 114 (distance OE2­NE ¼ ° 3.09 A). In the crystal, this hydrogen bonding network is observed in about 80% of the subunits. In solution, however, it is likely to pertain to all monomers given the random dehydration process that takes place during crystal growth. The spectroscopic properties of LmDps in solution are essentially the same as those of LiDps, as indicated by the far- and near-UV CD and fluorescence emission spectra measured at 208C in MOPS-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0. (Fig. 2, solid lines). Effect of pH on the Dodecameric Structure of L. monocytogenes Dps The stability of LmDps as a function of pH was studied in comparison with that of LiDps, which is known to dissociate below pH 2.0.12 Both proteins were incubated at pH 7.0, 2.0, 1.5, and 1.0 at 208C for 24 h, a time sufficient to reach an equilibrium condition. All samples were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism, and emission fluorescence spectroscopy. LmDps incubated at low pH values shows size exclusion chromatography elution profiles similar to those reported for LiDps.12 In particular, LmDps incubated at pH 2.0 elutes as a single, sharp peak at 10.5 mL that corresponds to the elution volume of the protein at pH 7.0. Thus, LmDps maintains its quaternary structure at pH 2.0 just as LiDps.12 Incubation at pH 1.5 gives rise to a slow moving component with an elution volume of 12.8 mL attributable to dimers; the dodecamer/dimer ratio resembles that observed for LiDps.12 After incubation at pH 1.0 monomers are formed as indicated by the appearance of a broad peak eluting between 12.0 and 14.0 mL (Fig. 3). The decrease in the area of the peak is indicative of the occurrence of precipitation. Near-UV CD spectra recorded on the very same samples analyzed by SEC indicate that at pH 2.0 the tertiary structure is preserved in both LmDps and LiDps. At

Fig. 3. Size-exclusion chromatography of L. monocytogenes Dps at acidic pH values. The protein (0.8 mg/mL) was incubated at 208C for 24 h at pH 2.0, 1.5, and 1.0. After incubation each mixture was diluted 20-fold by injection in the loop of a Superose 12 column and eluted at 0.5 mL minÀ1 with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 containing 0.15 M NaCl. The elution volume (Ve) was 10.5 mL for the native dodecameric protein (N), 12.8 mL for the dimeric protein (D) and 12.0­ 14.0 mL for the monomeric species (M).

The intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of LmDps and LiDps at different pH values are reported in Figure 2(E,F). The maximum emission wavelength is centered at 340 nm at pH 7.0 and pH 2.0 and is red-shifted to 346 nm for both proteins at pH 1.5. At pH 1.0 the redshift is to 343 nm for LmDps and to 347 nm for LiDps. Time-Dependence of the Unfolding Process at pH 1.5 The unfolding process of LmDps and LiDps was studied by monitoring the changes in the near- and far-UV circular dichroism spectra as a function of time at pH 1.5, a condition where the denaturation process is complete within 1 h thus allowing a large number of spectra to be recorded and a proper rate to be measured. To discriminate the relative contribution of Asp 126 and Lys 114 to protein stability the unfolding kinetics of the single mutants D126N and K114Q were assessed in parallel. Proteins were diluted 100-fold into a solution of 31.6 mM HCl (pH 1.5) at 208C and the ellipticity changes at 270 nm [Fig. 4(A)] or at 222 nm [Fig. 4(B)] were followed as a function of time and analyzed after removal of high-frequency noise and low frequency errors by means of a singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm. The global changes in the near-UV (250­310 nm) and far-UV (198­250 nm) spectral regions were analyzed separately. The analysis shows that only two spectral components contribute to both the near-UV and far-UV circular dichroism spectra. On this basis, the half-times of the unfolding process were calculated by

Fig. 2. Effect of pH on the spectral properties of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua Dps. All the spectra were recorded at 208C after 24 h incubation of LmDps (A, C, E) and LiDps (B, D, F) at pH 7.0 (20 mM sodium phosphate, ----), pH 2.0 (10 mM HCl, ÁÁÁÁ), pH 1.5 (31.6 mM HCl, ­ ­ ­) and pH 1.0 (100 mM HCl, ­Á­Á­).

pH 1.5 and at pH 1.0, the near UV CD spectra of the two proteins are comparable and characterized by the absence of dichroic activity over the entire spectral range, pointing to the disappearance of all the aromatic residues contributions [Fig. 2(A,B)]. The far-UV CD spectra of the two proteins monitored under the same conditions likewise display similar changes [Fig. 2(C,D)]. At pH 2.0, the far UV CD spectra of LmDps and LiDps are comparable to those at pH 7.0. They are characterized by the same molar ellipticity ratio [Y222]/[Y208] of 1.2 and the same zero intercept at 203 nm. The far-UV CD spectra of both proteins at pH 1.5 and pH 1.0 show similar changes: the molar ellipticity ratio [Y222]/[Y208] corresponds to 0.9 and the zero intercept to 201 nm.

LiDps (l), D126N mutant (!), K114Q mutant (~) and LmDps (n). The ellipticity changes at 270 nm (A) and 222 nm (B) were recorded at 208C after a pH jump from 7.0 to 1.5. The insets show the time dependence of the near-UV CD (A) and farUV CD (B) spectral changes of LmDps after removal of the high-frequency noise and the low frequency random errors by SVD. Protein concentration was 0.8 mg/mL and 25.0 lg/mL for the near- and far-UV CD measurements, respectively.

changes in ellipticity at 222 nm were monitored at increments of 48C and were analyzed using the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy, Ea, for LmDps is 31.03 Æ 1.89 kcal/mol, a significantly higher value than that calculated for LiDps (22.36 Æ 1.65 kcal/mol). The kinetics of the unfolding process at pH 1.5 was investigated also by following the changes in the intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity at 370 nm, which monitors exposure to solvent of the two tryptophan residues, Trp 32 and Trp 144, that are located at the dimeric and trimeric ``ferritin-like'' interface, respectively. The shape of the kinetic curves recorded after the jump to pH 1.5 differs significantly in LiDps, LmDps and in the single mutants. All the proteins exhibit a fast phase characterized by an increase in emission fluorescence intensity, but LiDps and D126N also display a second, slower phase where intensity decreases (Fig. 5, Table III).

Thermal Denaturation The thermal stability of LmDps was investigated at different pH values by monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm continuously between 20 and 958C in comparison with that of LiDps (Table IV). The observed transitions are irreversible and the spectra measured at the end of the cooling phase differ from those of the protein at 208C. At pH 7.0, the transition is not complete at 958C for both LiDps and LmDps, as shown by the persistence of more than 50% of the total native ellipticity, such that a Tm value could not be determined (data not shown). On this basis, thermal denaturations were performed at acidic pH values where the destabilizing effect of hydrogen ions is expected to decrease the transition temperature. The parameter chosen to compare the transition curves of LiDps and LmDps is the melting temperature (Tm) defined as the mid point of the denaturation process and calculated by plotting the first derivative of the molar ellipticity values as a function of temperature. The melting temperature of LmDps varies between 928C at pH 4.0 and 638C at pH 2.0 and is consistently higher than that pertaining to LiDps over the whole pH range analysed (Table IV).

fitting the 270-nm and 222-nm experimental curves to a first order kinetics. The denaturation process proceeds at different rates in the different proteins analyzed (Fig. 4 and Table III). In LiDps, the tertiary structure is lost with a half-time of 210 Æ 3 s. Interestingly, the single mutations Lys 114 ? Gln and Asp 126 ? Asn have opposite effects on the half-time which decreases to 74 Æ 2 s in the D126N mutant and increases to 396 Æ 8 s in the K114Q mutant. In LmDps the half-time is increased even further to 1123 Æ 9 s. The decrease in a-helical content displays the same trend as the loss of tertiary structure and is characterized by half-times of 199 Æ 4 s in LiDps, 70 Æ 3 s in the D126N mutant, 286 Æ 6 s in the K114Q mutant, and 783 Æ 9 s in LmDps. In another set of experiments, the unfolding kinetics at pH 1.5 was measured as a function of temperature between 88C and 328C for LiDps and LmDps. The

DISCUSSION L. innocua Dps and its natural mutant L. monocytogenes Dps differ in only two amino acid residues located on the molecular surface at a subunit interface and hence provide an ideal model system to assess the effect of changes in the electrostatic surface charge on the stability of multimeric proteins. The X-ray crystal structures of LiDps and LmDps are completely superimposable (root mean square deviations ° ¼ 0.24 A), except for the contact region in the vicinity of the 114 and 126 residues that differentiate the two proteins. Thus, the salt bridge formed at the ``ferritin-like'' interface of LiDps by Lys 114 and Asp 126 is replaced by a hydrogen bonding network in LmDps, which contains the uncharged polar residues Gln 114 and Asn 126.

the other interactions that contribute to the high stability of the LiDps oligomeric assembly at low pH are maintained in LmDps, that is those at the dimeric interface, the hydrophobic interactions between dimers, the two salt bridges (Lys141­Glu 62 and Asp 140­Arg 63) at the ``ferritin-like'' interface, and the interactions at the ``Dps-like interface.'' It follows that the effect of substituting a single salt-bridge can be evaluated. Size exclusion chromatography and spectroscopic analyses performed at low pH under equilibrium conditions indicate that disruption of the Lys 114­Asp 126 salt bridge does not affect the quaternary association state(s) and the spectroscopic properties, which are very similar in the two proteins (Figs. 2 and 3 and Ref. 12). However, thermal denaturation experiments and the unfolding kinetics at low pH clearly demonstrate that the stability of LmDps is increased significantly with respect to LiDps. In LmDps the Tm value is about 108C higher than in LiDps over the pH range 2.0­4.0. The increased thermal stability may be attributed to the optimization of the surface electrostatics, as reported for many proteins,23­25 although the complexity of the system and the irreversibility of the denaturation process do not allow determination of thermodynamic parameters relative to the thermal unfolding transitions. The rate of unfolding upon a pH jump from 7.0 to 1.5 is significantly slower in LmDps than in LiDps. Interestingly, the rates at which secondary and tertiary structure elements are lost are very similar in both proteins, whereas those monitoring changes in quaternary assembly, as reflected in the rates of tryptophan exposure to solvent, differ in detail (Table III). Even though the structural complexity of the system does not warrant the identification of putative intermediates, these differences can be taken to advantage to assess the specific contribution of Lys 114 and Asp 126 in conferring stability to the oligomeric assembly. In this respect the behavior of the single mutants K114Q and D126N is of value (Fig. 4). The kinetic stability decreases in the order LmDps > K114Q > LiDps ) D126N suggesting that the Lys 114 residue, and more specifically the charge it carries, plays a major role in determining this property. In LiDps and in the D126N mutant the positive charge of the Lys 114 amino group is unbalanced at pH 1.5 due to the likely protonation of the Asp 126 carboxylate moiety in LiDps or to the presence of the uncharged Asn 126 residue in the mutant. Substitution of Lys 114 with Gln in both LmDps and the K114Q mutant removes the unbalanced positive charge from the contact region. Thus, the presence of a positive surface charge at the ``ferritin-like'' interface contributes negatively to the kinetic stability of the D126N mutant and LiDps and may destabilize their native state upon a pH jump from 7.0 to pH 1.5. In LiDps, when considering the contribution of Lys 114, the possible formation of an intrasubunit salt bridge with Glu 118 (distance of about 4 ° A) should be taken into account since this salt bridge may coexist and compete with the Lys 114­Asp 126 one at neutral pH values. In the D126N mutant, the Glu

118­Lys 114 salt bridge shields Lys 114 from intersubunit contacts and thus could contribute to destabilize the native state as manifest when pH is brought to 1.5. On the other hand, in LmDps Gln 114 is available both for the intersubunits contact mediated by wA and the intrasubunit H-bond interaction with the Glu 118 side-chain, and thereby plays a role in the kinetic stabilization of the native state (Fig. 1). The local rearrangement of the interactions in the 114 and 126 residues contact region however entails replacement of the salt bridge connecting Lys 114 to Asp 126 in LiDps with the hydrogen bonding network characteristic of LmDps (Fig. 1). In the latter protein, the activation energy of the unfolding process is about 10 kcal/mol higher than in LiDps suggesting that a higher number of weak interactions contributes to its stabilization. The effect of hydrogen bonding networks in conferring stability is reported for several protein systems.26,27 It may be invoked also to account for the observed differences in kinetic stability between LiDps and LmDps upon the pH jump to 1.5. Thus, the hydrogen bonding network in LmDps is expected to persist at low pH since it involves aminoacid residues which cannot be protonated under the experimental conditions employed. In contrast, the salt-bridge interaction between Lys 114 and Asp 126 in LiDps is most likely abolished at pH 1.5 due to protonation of the Asp 126 carboxylate moiety. In addition, in LmDps the two water molecules involved in the formation of the hydrogen bonding network may favor the interactions of the protein shell with solvent. In conclusion, the present study brings out that a single salt bridge located at a subunit interface can furnish a significant contribution to the stabilization of multimeric protein assemblages. It also shows that the high intrinsic stability of LiDps is enhanced further in LmDps through the optimization of the surface electrostatics and of hydrogen bonding and protein-solvent interactions. These contributions may be effective in raising the kinetic barriers between the native state and the partially denatured state(s) of the protein. REFERENCES
