Mast cells have been implicated in several fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPFa).1 These are grievous diseases with high mortality rates. Patients with IPF, for example, have a mean life span of 3-8 years from onset of disease. Mast cells are predominantly expressed beneath epithelia surfaces, in the mucosal and connective tissues of the skin, the airways, and the intestines. Considered as effector cells in allergy, inflammation, autoimmunity, and fibrosis, these cells are a major source of preformed TNF, pro-inflammatory, and profibrotic mediators.2 In fibrosis, activated mast cells release mediators to promote fibroblast proliferation.1 Reciprocally, fibroblasts secrete stem cell factor (SCF), also known as mast cell growth factor or Steel ligand, to induce further mast cell expansion and activation.3 Excessive elevation of mast cell burden has been linked to various fibrotic diseases.4 Furthermore, attenuation of fibrosis has been reported in mast cell deficient mice.5 Therefore, regulation of mast cell proliferation and function may have therapeutic potential in fibrotic diseases.

Essential for mast cell survival, proliferation, activation, and chemotaxis is the activation of c-Kit receptors expressed on the surface of mast cells.6 c-Kit is a member of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family along with colony-stimulating factor-1 (cFMS) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). c-Kit is activated upon binding of its cognate ligand, stem cell factor. Excessive levels of SCF or autoactivation of c-Kit, due to gain-of-function mutations, have been linked to mastocytosis.6 The association between c-Kit, mast cells, and fibrosis is supported by several preclinical studies conducted with imatinib mesylate, a multikinase inhibitor that inhibited c-Kit.7 In the clinic, imatinib treatment reduced bone marrow fibrosis in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.8 Clinical evaluation of imatinib in IPF patients is currently underway. We were interested in developing a potent and selective c-Kit inhibitor for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. To enhance the safety margin, we decided that a more selective c-Kit inhibitor that does not interfere with kinases associated with angiogenesis and immune cell signaling pathways, such as KDR, p38, Lck, and Src, was highly desired. Our investigation began with novel pyridone 1, which was identified by a screen of our proprietary kinase preferred library. Pyridone 1 was a nonselective inhibitor of c-Kit (IC50 ) 6.1 nM, Table 1). This report describes the structure-activity relationship investigations that led to the discovery of potent c-Kit inhibitors that exhibited greater than 200-fold kinase selectivity against KDR, p38, Lck, and Src. Inhibition of c-Kit phosphorylation was measured by a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescent kinase assay and a SCF stimulated UT7 cell proliferation/survival assay. In vivo efficacy was assessed in a rodent pharmacodynamic model of mast cell activation to demonstrate proof-of-concept. The general synthetic strategy for these pyridone analogues is illustrated in Scheme 1. In a two-step, one-pot protocol developed by Hynes and Campbell, 5-bromo-2-fluorobenzaldehyde 3 was reacted with guanidine carbonate at 160 °C to form 2-amino-6-bromoquinazoline 4.9 Miyaura conditions converted the aryl bromide to boronic ester 5.10 Preparation of PMB protected pyridine 7 was accomplished by reacting 3-bromo2-chloro-4-methylpyridine 6 with (4-methoxyphenyl)methanol. Suzuki coupling of aminoquinazoline boronic ester 5 with bromo pyridine 7 afforded aminoquinazoline pyridine 8. Deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid produced pyridone 9. Selective Nalkylation was achieved with sodium hydride to form alkyl pyridone 10. Buchwald's copper-catalyzed aryl amidation provided aryl pyridones 11-19 in good yield.11

a Reaction conditions: (a) guanidine carbonate, DIPEA, NMP, 160°C, (48%); (b) bis(pinacolato)diboron, KOAc, PdCl2(dppf) · CH2Cl2, 85°C, (50%); (c) NaH, PMBOH, (96%); (d) Pd(OAc)2, S-phos, K3PO4 (90%); (e) TFA; (f) NaH, 2-cyclopentylethyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate, 70°C (20%); (g) CuI, K3PO4, DMEDA, ArI, NMP, 85°C (60-80% two steps).

Figure 1. Overlap of co-crystal structures of pyridone 1 and bisamide 2 in V916T KDR mutant protein.

Our first approach to improve the kinase selectivity was to compare pyridone 1 to bisamide 2, a more selective c-Kit inhibitor we recently reported (Table 1).12 The aliphatic group on 2 was necessary for kinase selectivity, but the reason for the
Table 2. SAR of Phenyl Ring Substitutions

selectivity was not evident based on the co-crystal structure. Nevertheless, overlay of co-crystal structures of 1 and 2 in the V916T mutant KDR protein (a close analog of c-Kit) showed that the aliphatic section of 2 was also the region where the molecules most differed (Figure 1). We hypothesized that attaching a similar alkyl group to the pyridone scaffold could improve its kinase selectivity. Indeed, alkyl pyridones such as cyclopentylethyl 10 did obtain greater than 500-fold kinase selectivity. However, these pyridones also exhibited high in vivo clearance in rats. Attempts to enhance metabolic stability by adding heteroatoms to the alkyl groups decreased c-Kit activity. Based on the overlapped structures, we then speculated that an investigation of substitutions on the 3- and 4- positions of the aryl pyridones could improve kinase selectivity. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic profiles of these pyridones might be more desirable. Thus, a systematic examination of the aryl pyridones was undertaken (Table 2). Devoid of any substitution on the lower aromatic ring, 11 exhibited decreased c-Kit activity (IC50 ) 0.21 µM). Mimicking the gem-dimethyl group on 1 with a tert-butyl group at the 4-position, 12 regained c-Kit potency (IC50 ) 2.1 nM) but exhibited poor selectivity. Further decreasing the steric bulk from trifluoromethyl group (13) to methoxy group (14) or chlorine (15) notably reduced inhibitory activity against KDR and p38 to the micromolar range. Regioisomer 16 exhibited comparable c-Kit potency and kinase selectivity. However, a nearly 4-fold decrease in c-Kit activity was observed with 17. Whereas 3-fluoro-4-chloro substitution (18) reduced c-Kit potency, 3-fluoro-4-methyl substitution (19) afforded a potent c-Kit inhibitor with at least 125-fold selectivity and greater than 5 µM activity against KDR, p38, Lck, and Src.13 Switching the positions of the methyl and fluoro groups (20) decreased kinase selectivity against Lck and Src. Unfortunately, pyridone 19 also exhibited high clearance in rats (CL ) 1.95 L/h/kg). With its 4-substituted methyl group a likely metabolic liability by oxidation, we examined alternative substituents at the 4-position to improve clearance. A representative subset of the analogs examined is shown in Table 3. Acetyl (21) and ethyl ester (22) replacements decreased selectivity against Lck and Src. While morpholine (23) restored Lck and Src activity to the micromolar range, N-linked pyrazole (24) reduced selectivity against Lck and Src. Fortunately, oxazole 25 resulted in both excellent c-Kit potency (enzyme IC50 ) 22 nM, cell IC50 ) 16 nM) and greater than 200-fold

selectivity against KDR, p38, Lck, and Src. Furthermore, clearance in rats also improved (CL ) 0.46 L/h/kg, Table 4). Although obtaining co-crystals of these pyridones in the c-Kit protein has been challenging, we succeeded in crystallizing 16 in mutant KDR (V916T). By changing the gatekeeper residue from valine to threonine, this mutant shares the majority of residues with c-Kit in the ATP binding pocket. On the basis of the co-crystal structure, we were able to infer the key interactions the compound would make in c-Kit (Figure 2). Occupying the ATP binding site, the inhibitor binds in the "DFG-out" conformation. Two nitrogens from the aminoquinazoline portion of the molecule form hydrogen bonding interactions with linker region of the enzyme at Cys673. The pyridone scaffold is further anchored by the hydrogen bond contacts between its carbonyl group and Asp810. To evaluate the efficacy of these c-Kit inhibitors in vivo, pyridone 16 was tested in a clinically relevant rodent pharmacodynamic model of mast cell activation. Functional activation of

mast cells in vivo following systemic administration of recombinant human stem cell factor has been reported in the clinic. Moreover, SCF administration to nonhuman primate results in mast cell hyperplasia.14 Thus, we used recombinant rodent SCF to promote mast cell activation in mice and assessed the extent of activation by measuring histamine release in the blood stream. The study began with a single oral administration of pyridone 16 to female C57BL/6 mice at 100, 20, and 5 mg/kg. One hour postdosing, 80 µg/kg of SCF was administered by intravenous injection. Fifteen minutes after SCF treatment, the mice were euthanized and blood was collected by cardiac puncture for histamine measurement and PK analysis. As shown in Figure 3, a dose-dependent decrease in SCF-induced histamine release was observed with ED50 of 4.7 mg/ kg. With mouse protein binding of 87.85% by ultracentrifugation, free fraction EC50 was 12.6 nM, comparable to cell IC50 of 28 nM for 16.15 Compared to imatinib, pyridones 16 and 25 exhibited comparable or better potency against c-Kit with approximately two-thirds of the molecular weight of imatinib (Table 5). Besides higher binding efficiency,16 these two compounds also achieved improved selectivity against off-target kinases such as p38 and Lck. Both pyridones also exhibited better selectivity against Abl, while 16 showed comparable selectivity against PDGFR compared to imatinib. Better selectivity against Abl may be desirable given a reported link between cardiotoxicity and inhibition of Abl.17 Because the residues comprising the ATP binding pocket of c-Kit and PDGFR are over 98% homologous, selectivity against PDGFR will likely be difficult to achieve.18 To date, a c-Kit inhibitor with significant PDGFR selectivity has not been reported. Meanwhile, several studies have suggested that inhibition of PDGFR may be beneficial for treatment of certain fibrotic conditions.19 Thus, a c-Kit

Further internal kinase screens showed that 16 and 25 were also selective against 36 and 41 other kinases, respectively.20 In conclusion, starting with a novel pyridone 1, our SAR efforts resulted in the identification of potent, selective, and orally efficacious c-Kit inhibitors. Improvements in kinase selectivity were achieved with alkyl pyridone 10 and aryl pyridones 16, 19, and 25. Pyridone 25 exhibited potent inhibition of c-Kit, greater than 200-fold selectivity against KDR, p38, Lck, and Src, and desirable pharmacokinetic properties. Oral efficacy in vivo was demonstrated in a clinically relevant rodent pharmacodynamic model of mast cell activation. Efficacy of c-Kit inhibition in a wound fibrogenesis model of mast cell activation and expansion will be reported in a separate publication.21 These findings suggest that the pyridones are promising therapeutic compounds for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.
