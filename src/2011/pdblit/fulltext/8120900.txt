Abstract

Annexin II is a Ca2÷-regulated membrane- and cytoskeleton-binding protein implicated in membrane transport events along the Ca2+-regulated secretory and the early endocytic pathway. Biochemical properties of this annexin and its intracellular distribution are regulated by complex formation with p l 1 (S 100AI0), a member of the S 100 protein family. The annexin II-pl 1 interaction is mediated through the unique N-terminal domain of annexin II and is inhibited by protein kinase C phosphorylation of a serine residue in annexin II. To map this regulatory serine phosphorylation site we developed a baculovirus-mediated expression system for wild-type annexin II and for a series of annexin II mutants which contained substitutions in one or more serine residues present in the N-terminal domain. The different mutant derivatives were purified and shown to display the same biochemical properties as recombinant wild-type annexin II and the authentic protein purified fi'om porcine intestine. However, significant differences in phosphate incorporation were observed when the individual serine mutants were subjected to phosphorylation by protein kinase C. A comparison of the phosphorylation patterns obtained identified Ser-11 as the protein kinase C site responsible for regulating the annexin II-pl 1 interaction. Ser-11 lies within the sequence mediating pl 1 binding, i.e. amino-acid residues 1 to 14 of annexin II, and phosphorylation at this site most likely leads to a direct spatial interference with pl 1 binding.

1. Introduction

Annexins are a family of soluble proteins which interact with cellular membranes in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner (for review see [1-3]). They are widely expressed in animals and plants and are often found on or in close proximity to cellular membranes. Based on this intracellular localization and due to their typical biochemical properties annexins have been implicated in a number of membrane related events. These range from the establishment a n d / o r regulation of membrane-membrane and membrane-cytoskeleton contacts to the organization of membrane domains and the regulation of ion currents across membranes (for review see [1-5]). Ca2+/phospholipid binding, the biochemical hallmark of the annexin family, is mediated through a protein core domain defined by its resistance towards limited proteolysis. This protein core is the principle structure of an

annexin and is built of four or eight repetitive segments of 70 to 80 amino acids, the annexin repeats. So-called type II and type III Ca 2+ binding sites, which are different in architecture from the type I EF-hand motif, are present in the annexin cores and Ca 2+ bound to the type II site is thought to provide bridging between the protein and phospholipids in membrane-bound annexins [6-8]. Biochemical and functional specificity for a given annexin is thought to be conferred through an unique N-terminal domain, which is sensitive to mild proteolytic attack and precedes the C-terminal protein core. The N-terminal domains of the annexins also appear to be of regulatory importance as they often contain phosphorylation sites for signal transducing kinases (for review see [2]). Annexin II is a substrate for serine/threonine- as well as tyrosine-specific kinases. All phosphorylation sites mapped so far are found in the N-terminal domain which as defined by limited chymotryptic cleavage contains the first 29 residues (for review see [9]). Tyr-23 is phosphorylated by the src tyrosine kinase [10] and by the insulin receptor kinase [11]. Ser-25, on the other hand, is a site for

phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) [12,13]. The N-terminal domain of annexin II also harbours the binding site for a cellular protein ligand, pl 1, which is a member of the S100 family of dimeric EF-hand type Ca 2+ binding proteins (for review see [14]). Within the annexin II molecule the pl 1 binding site is contained in the N-terminal 14 residues and binding leads to the formation of a heterotetrameric annexin II2-pl 12 complex [15,16]. Both, p l l binding and phosphorylation are of regulatory importance with respect to the biochemical properties displayed by annexin II and are also thought to regulate the intracellular function of this annexin. Tyrosine-phosphorylated annexin II has a reduced affinity towards Ca2+/phospholipid and phosphorylation at Ser-25 markedly increases the Ca 2+ concentration required for phospholipid vesicle aggregation by the annexin II-pl 1 complex [17,18]. Moreover, Ser-25 phosphorylation by PKC appears to be a prerequisite for the stimulation of Ca2+-dependent secretion by the annexin II-pl 1 complex observed in permeabilized chromaffin cells [19]. The Ca 2+ requirement for the annexin II-phospholipid interaction is altered by p l l binding, since phospholipid binding and vesicle aggregation occur at significantly lower Ca z+ concentrations in the case of the annexin II-pl 1 heterotetramer [17,20]. pl 1-induced formation of the annexin II-pl 1 complex also regulates the intracellular localization of annexin II. While monomeric annexin II is at least in part a cytosolic protein the annexin II-p 11 complex appears to be restricted to the membrane-associated cytoskeleton [21,22]. Here, the complex is thought to fulfill a structural role in linking peripheral membranes - e.g., secretory granules in chromaffin cells and early endosomes in differentiated epithelial cells - to one another a n d / o r to the plasma membrane or the cortical cytoskeleton [23,24]. The complex formation between annexin II and p l l itself is also regulated through phosphorylation, since PKC-phosphorylated annexin II fails to bind pl 1 [13]. This regulatory important phosphorylation of annexin II by PKC occurs at a second serine residue in the N-terminal domain, which is different from Ser-25 and most likely also the target for calmodulin and cAMP-dependent kinases ['13]. Here we employed a mutagenesis approach combined with the in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant annexin II mutants expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells to map this second PKC phosphorylation site. This approach unambiguously identifies Ser-ll located within the p l l binding region and thus provides a structural explanation for the regulation of the annexin II-pl 1 interaction through PKC phosphorylation.
2. Material and methods

into the annexin II and pl 1 subunits in the presence of 9 M urea [15]. The subunits were separated by gel filtration and then individually renatured by dialysis against 25 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaC1, 3 mM MgCI 2, and 1 mM NaN 3.

2.2. Site-specific mutagenesis
Specific mutations were introduced into the human annexin II cDNA [25] cloned into M13 mpl8 by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis [26]. Multiple mutations were introduced by annealing several oligonucleotides simultaneously. All mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing [27]. Cloning was carried out following standard procedures [28].

2.3. Construction of recombinant baculovirus clones
Wild-type and mutant annexin II cDNA's were cloned into the BamHI/XbaI-linearized baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 [29]. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced by homologous recombination following cotransfection of 2 × 10 6 SF9 insect cells with 0.5 /xg baculo-gold DNA (Pharmingen) and 2 /zg of the respective pVL-Anx II plasmid DNA using 30 /zl lipofectin (Gibco BRL). The SF9 cells were cultivated for 5-7 days before the culture supernatant containing the recombinant baculoviruses was harvested. A standard plaque assay was used to determine the virus titer (Pharmingen, laboratory manual) prior to infection of SF9 cells on a quantitative scale.

2.4. Culture and infection of SF9 cells
SF9 cells were grown at 27°C in TC-100 insect medium (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamin (Gibco BRL), 100 U / m l penicillin (Seromed), 100 U / m l streptomycin (Seromed). For the production of recombinant annexin II derivatives, SF9 cells were propagated in 800 ml flasks (Falcon) as adherent cells with 40 ml of TC-100 medium. When the density of the cells reached 60% confluence, the cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at multiplicities of 1-2 viruses per cell. 40 hours post infection, the cells were harvested and used for the isolation of recombinant annexin II.

2.5. Purification of recombinant annexin H from SF9 cells
Infected SF9 cells expressing recombinant annexin II were scraped into 10 ml phosphate-buffered saline using a rubber policeman and harvested by low-speed centrifugation (1200 rpm, 15 min, 4°C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml buffer A (50 mM imidazole-HC1, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaC1, 2 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10 /zg/ml aprotinin, 1 /xg/ml pepstatin, 10 /xM L-3-transcarboxyoxiran-2-carbonyl-L-leucyl-agmantin (E-64, Biomol)) and cells were lysed by sonication for 2 × 20 sec

2.1. Purification of porcine annexin H and p l l

using a Branson sonifier at 30% power. The homogenate was adjusted to 5 mM CaC12 and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C in a SS34 rotor (Sorvall). The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml buffer A containing 10 mM EGTA. This step led to a complete solubilization of annexin II which was associated with the pelleted membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The EGTA extract was centrifuged at 55 000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C in a TLAI00.3 rotor (Beckman) and the resulting supernatant was dialyzed against buffer B (25 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCI, 3 mM MgC12, 1 mM Dq'T, 1 mM NAN3). To achieve additional purification of the recombinant protein it was dialyzed against buffer C (25 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM NaN 3) and then applied on a Mono S cation--exchange column. The column was developed with a linear salt gradient (0-0.5 M NaC1 in buffer C) and annexin II eluted at approx. 250 mM NaC1. All annexin II derivatives were purified following the same procedure and could be stored at 4°C for several weeks.
2.6. p l l binding to immobilized annexin H (ligand blotting)

SDS sample buffer and analyzed together with the supernatant by SDS-PAGE and ligand blotting.
2.8. Mixed micelle and phosphatidylserine vesicle preparation

For micelle preparation, 200 /xl dioleoylglycerophosphoserine (10 m g / m l in chloroform/methanol (90:10), kindly provided by Dr. H. Eibl, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gtittingen, Germany) were mixed with 4/~1 PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 1 m g / m l in ethanol; Sigma), dried under nitrogen and then dissolved in 800 /xl of a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), and 1.5% Triton X-100 by vortexing for 2 min. Liposomes were prepared by mixing 200 /~1 dioleoylglycerophosphoserine (see above) with 10 /xl cholesterol (10 m g / m l in chloroform). The material was dried under nitrogen, resuspended in a buffer containing 25 mM TrisHC1, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaC1 and then sonicated 3-times for 20 sec at 30% power (Branson sonifier). Mixed micelles and liposomes were prepared freshly before use.
2.9. Phosphorylation of annexin H

1 /zg purified annexin II (wild-type or serine mutant derivatives) was subjected to SDS-PAGE [30] and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane [31]. The membrane was blocked using 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS-T (20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaC1, 0.2% Tween 20) and then incubated in a solution containing porcine pl 1 (2 /zg/ml in 3% BSA/TBS-T) for 60 min at 37°C. After extensive washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated for 60 min at 37°C with the monoclonal anti-pl 1 antibody H21 [32] used at 0 . 3 / x g / m l in 3% BSA/TBS-T. Bound antibody was vismdized using peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (diluted 1:6000, Dako) and the ECL chemoluminescence system (Amersham).
2.7. Immunoprecipitation of the annexin H-pl l complex

Phosphorylation of 4 / z g recombinant annexin II (wildtype or serine mutants expressed in SF9 cells) was carried out for 30 min at 30°C in 50 ~1 buffer containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 /xl mixed micelles, 5 mM MgCI z, 0.75 mM CaCI 2, 1.2 mM fl-mercaptoethanol, and 50 ng fl-PKC (kindly provided by Dr. Ph. Bastians, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, G6ttingen, Germany). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 nmol [ 3/- 32P]ATP with a specific activity of 2 /xCi/nmol. Phosphorylation was stopped by chloroform/methanol precipitation of the proteins [33], which were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE [30]. The SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and dried onto Whatman 3MM paper. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography using Kodak Xomat AR films (Kodak).

Immunoprecipitation of reconstituted annexin II-pll complexes was carried out using the monoclonal anti-pl 1 antibody H21 [32] coupled to sheep-anti-mouse IgG-conjugated dynabeads (Dynal). For complex formation 3 /zg annexin II was mixed with 1.3 p,g pl 1 and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 50 /zl dynabeads containing 1.5/xg bound H21 IgGs were added and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Using a magnetic device the beads were then separated from the unbound protein fraction and washed two times with TBS-T-B (TBS-T plus 0.02% BSA) followed by TBS-T-B containing 0.5 M NaC1. Unbound proteins were recovered from the first supernatant, precipitated with chloroform/methanol [33] and resuspended in 15 /~1 SDS sample buffer [30]. The beads, representing the fraction of pl 1-bound annexin II, were resuspended directly in 15 /xl

3. Results
3.1. Expression of mutant annexin H derivatives in baculovirus-infected insect cells

Limited proteolysis of PKC phosphorylated annexin II had revealed that the serine residue whose phosphorylation interferes with pl 1 binding is located within the N-terminal 29 amino acids of annexin II [13]. This sequence harbours five serines at positions 1, 11, 17, 21, and 25 which theoretically could serve as phosphate acceptors (Fig. 1). One of these, Ser-25, represents the previously mapped PKC site whose phosphorylation does not affect the annexin II-pll complex formation [12,13]. A second one, the N-terminally acetylated Ser-1, is highly unlikely

to serve as a substrate for PKC since phosphorylation of such N-terminal serines has not been reported previously (for review see [34]). This leaves the serines at positions 11, 17, and 21 as candidate residues representing the second PKC site functionally distinct from Ser-25. To distinguish between the different serines and to map the second PKC site we chose a mutagenesis approach. One, two, or three serine residues in the N-terminal domain were replaced by alanine resulting in cDNAs encoding a SI1A, a $21/25A and a SI 1 / 2 1 / 2 5 A derivative of annexin II (Fig. 1). These mutations were selected to unambiguously identify the acceptor site after PKC phosphorylation of the expressed mutant proteins. If Ser-21 were the second PKC site (in addition to Ser-25) phosphorylation of the $21/25A mutant should be completely abolished. Phosphorylation of this mutant but not the S 1 1 / 2 1 / 2 5 A derivative would be expected to occur in the case of Set-11 being the second site. Finally, Ser-17 would have been identified as second PKC-site if both, $21/25A and S l l / 2 1 / 2 5 A , would continue to serve as PKC substrates. The S l l A mutant was included as a positive control since it contained an unaltered Ser-25 known to represent a site for PKC phosphorylation [12,13]. Correct N-terminal processing of annexin II - i.e., acetylation of the N-terminal serine residue - is a prerequisite for pl 1 binding and is likely to effect the folding of the N-terminal domain (for review see [35]). Since N-terminal acetylation could also affect phosphorylation, we chose an eucaryotic expression system known to yield a faithfully processed N-terminal end for generating the serine mutant derivatives of annexin II. The cDNAs encoding wild-type annexin II or the SllA, $21/25A, and S l l / 2 1 / 2 5 A mutants, respectively, were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 and the resulting constructs were used to transfect SF9 insect cells. Analysis of the total protein fraction of the infected insect cells by SDS-PAGE reveals that the recombinant proteins are efficiently expressed (an example is shown for wild-type annexin II in Fig. 2). All annexin II derivatives were purified from the appropriately infected SF9 cells by a combination of a Ca 2+-dependent protein fractionation and ion-exchange chromatography. This protocol yielded 200 /zg of essentially pure protein ( > 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE) from 5 × 10 7 SF9 ceils grown in a 800 ml

Fig. 1. Sequence of the N-terminal 29 amino-acid residues of annexin II. The sequence of wild-type human annexin II [25] is compared to that of the serine mutants generated here. In these mutant derivatives putative PKC phosphorylation sites (marked by asterisks) were inactivated by alanine-to-serine substitutions. Dashes indicate that the mutant sequences were otherwise identical to that of the wild-type protein.

The annexin II derivatives purified from infected SF9 cells (WT, SIlA, $21/25A, and S l l / 2 1 / 2 5 A , respectively) were first subjected to phospholipid liposome pelleting. In this assay annexins are typically pelleted together with the liposomes in a Ca2+-dependent manner (for review see [2]). This property is shared by all annexin II derivatives expressed in SF9 cells and the results are indistinguishable from those obtained for authentic annexin II purified from porcine intestine (not shown). To analyze the folding of the N-terminal domain relative to the protein core we then subjected the recombinant annexin II derivatives to immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody H28 [32]. This antibody recognizes a discontinuous epitope which involves Lys-27 of the Nterminal domain and Arg-62 and Arg-67 of the first annexin repeat [36]. All annexin II derivatives expressed in SF9 cells showed the same reactivity towards the H28 antibody as authentic porcine annexin II indicating that the close proximity of the N-terminal domain and the first annexin repeat of the protein core is not affected in the region of the epitope (not shown). Complex formation of the recombinant proteins with

p l l was analyzed by employing a ligand blotting assay. Here, we exploited the ability of immobilized annexin II to bind pl 1 [37]. The annexin H derivatives expressed in SF9 cells as well as authentic annexin II isolated from porcine intestine (as positive contrel) and a bacterially expressed annexin II containing an altered N-terminal end [38] (as negative control) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then incubated with a solution containing p l l purified from porcine intestine. Subsequently, p l l binding to the immobilized proteins was monitored by staining with a monoclonal antibody directed against pl 1. Fig. 3A shows that all annexin II derivatives expressed in SF9 cells bind p l l with similar efficiency thus demonstrating that all possess a correctly processed N-terminal end. In contrast, the bacterially expressed protein, which contains an additional six amino acids fused to the N-terminal domain and which is not acetylated at its N-terminal end [38], fails to interact with pl 1.

Fig. 4. Phosphorylation of the recombinant annexin II derivatives by PKC. Human annexin II and the mutant derivatives carrying amino-acid substitutions in putative serine phosphorylation sites of the N-terminal domain (see Fig. 1 for details) were expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells and purified as described (see Fig. 2 for details). Identical amounts of the purified proteins were subjected to a PKC phosphorylation reaction in the presence (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or absence (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) of phospholipid micelles and then analyzed by SDS-PAGEand autoradiography. Note that the annexin II derivatives S11A (lane 3) and $21/25A (lane 5) are phosphorylated to a level of approx. 50% as compared to that of wild-type annexin II. This indicates the loss of one of the two phosphorylation sites located in the N-terminal domain. S11/21/25A fails to serve as a substrate for PKC indicating that Ser-17 is not phosphorylated(lane 7).

Fig. 3. Interaction of the recombinant annexin II derivatives with pl ] as revealed by ligand blotting (A) and immunoprecipitation (B). Panel A shows a ligand blotting assay. 1 /~g annexin II purified from E. coil cells expressing human annexin II [38] (lane 1), purified from porcine intestine (lane 2), and purified from SE9 cells expressing wild-type (lane 3), S1 I A (lane 4), and $21/25A annexin II (lane 5), respectively, was subjected to
SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated in a solution containing porcine pl 1 and annexin II-bound pl 1 was subsequently visualized by immunoblotting. Note that pl 1 only binds to annexin II derivatives containi~ag a correctly processed - - i.e. acetylated, N-terminal end. In contrast the bacterially expressed protein fails to interact with p 11 and only shows background labelling, lmmunoprecipitation of a complex reconstituted from pl 1 and recombinant annexin II is shown in B. Wild-type annexin I]( expressed in SF9 cells was incubated with pl 1 and the reconstituted annexin II-pl 1 complex was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal anti-pl I antibody H21 bound to magnetic beads. The non-precipitated fraction (lanes 1 and 2) and the immunoprecipitated material (lanes 3, 4) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the monoclonal anti-annexin II antibody H28 [32]. This antibody recognizes a discontinuo,as epitope which involves Lys-27 of the N-terminal domain and Arg-62 and Arg-67 of the first annexin repeat [36] and thus recognizes not only intact annexin II (36 kDa) but also a N-terminally truncated derivative., of 33 kDa generated by proteolysis which occurred upon longer storage. Note that this proteolysed protein remains in the superuatant due to a loss of the pl 1 binding site comprising residues 1-14. Intact recombinant annexin II, on the other hand, is co-immunoprecipitated with pl 1 (lane 3). Lanes 2 and 4 show controls in which the precipitation was carried out without adding p l l . Arrows indicate heavy and light chains of the H21 antibodies which were used for immunoprecipitation and are recognized by the secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgGs.

The interaction between p l 1 and annexin II expressed in SF9 cells was also analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. Therefore, the purified annexin II derivatives were incubated with an equimolar amount of porcine p l l and the mixture was then subjected to immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal anti-pl 1 antibody attached to magnetic beads. All SF9-expressed derivatives are precipitated with the beads in a strictly pll-dependent manner indicating that p 11 binding and reconstitution of the annexin II-p 11 complex had occurred (a representative example, in this case for wild-type annexin II, is shown in Fig. 3B). Thus, by all criteria analyzed recombinant annexin II expressed in SF9 insect cells displays the same biochemical properties as the authentic protein purified from mammalian cells. Moreover, the serine mutants generated here (S11A, $ 2 1 / 2 5 A , and S 1 1 / 2 1 / 2 5 A annexin II) are biochemically indistinguishable from wild-type annexin II.

3.3. Ser-11 is the second PKC phosphorylation site in the N-terminal domain of annexin H
The annexin II proteins purified from SF9 insect cells (WT, S l l A , $ 2 1 / 2 5 A , and S l l / 2 1 / 2 5 A annexin II) were subjected to a standard PKC phosphorylation reaction using conditions employed previously to describe the existence of two functionally distinct PKC sites [13]. Fig. 4 shows the combined results of these phosphorylation reactions. When compared to W T annexin II only approx. 50%

of the label is incorporated in the S l l A and $21/25A mutant proteins indicative of an inactivation of one of the two phosphorylation sites in each of the two mutants. This must be the known Ser-25 in the $21/25A derivative and is likely to be Ser-ll in the SI1A mutant. Finally, the S 1 1 / 2 1 / 2 5 A mutant protein, which only contains a serine residue at position 17, fails to serve as a substrate for PKC (Fig. 4). Since $21/25A annexin II - i.e., a mutant containing the only serine residues of the N-terminal domain at positions l l and 17 - continues to become phosphorylated and since Ser-17 can be excluded as a target for PKC (the $ 1 1 / 2 1 / 2 5 A derivative is not phosphorylated), our combined results unambiguously identify Ser-ll as the second serine phosphorylation site. As expected for PKC catalyzed reactions all phosphorylations required the presence of phospholipid micelles as a cofactor for the enzyme (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7 to lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively).

4. Discussion

Annexin II, a member of the annexin family which is subject to a number of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation by PKC, has been implicated in membrane-related events along the endocytic and the regulated secretory pathway (for review see [1,4]). In particular, later steps in the Ca2+-regulated secretion of catecholamines in chromaffin cells and the peripheral positioning of early endosomes in polarized epithelial cells appear to be affected by annexin II [19,24,39]. It has been discussed that annexin II plays a structural role in these processes by organizing membranes, by providing a physical link between membrane surfaces (e.g., the chromaffin granule and the plasma membrane) a n d / o r by linking membranes to the associated cytoskeleton. Such a bridging activity would depend on the formation of the annexin II-pll heterotetramer which contains two annexin II cores and thus two binding domains for phospholipids a n d / o r cytoskeletal elements. In this scenario PKC catalyzed phosphorylation at Ser-11 of the annexin II chain would be of critical regulatory importance. It would interfere with the annexin II-pl 1 interaction leading to an accumulation of annexin II monomers no longer capable of providing membranemembrane a n d / o r membrane-cytoskeleton linkages. Ser-ll of annexin II is part of the p l l binding region which comprises residues 1 to 14 [16]. However, it is most likely not directly involved in establishing protein-protein interactions, since the hydrophobic side chains at position 3, 6, 7, and 10 represent the major contact sites for pl 1 [40]. These lie on the hydrophobic side of an amphiphatic c~-helix formed by the N-terminal 14 residues of annexin II. In a helical wheel projection of this sequence Ser-11 is located at the border between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic side of the helix [16]. This spatial relationship would explain that the alanine for serine replacement in

our S l l A mutant has no effect on p l l binding (Fig. 3), whereas the introduction of the negatively charged phosphate group in phosphorylated annexin II inhibits p l 1 binding. The latter is also illustrated in an analysis of the p 11 interaction with synthetic peptides comprising residues 1 to 14 of annexin II (with an acetylated N-terminal serine; A c l - 1 4 ) or mutations of this sequence. While wild-type A c l - 1 4 is capable of binding p l l with high affinity and specificity, a mutant peptide containing a single aspartic acid for serine replacement at position 11 shows a markedly reduced affinity [40]. Thus, the introduction of a side chain with a negative charge at position 11 (through phosphorylation or amino-acid replacement) probably plays an important role in reducing within the N-terminal domain of annexin II the affinity for p 11. While phosphorylation at Ser-11 could directly regulate the annexin II-p 11 interaction, the second PKC phosphorylation site present in the N-terminal domain of annexin II (Ser-25) is also accessible in the annexin II-pll complex and phosphate incorporation at this site does not interfere with p l l binding [13]. However, Ser-25 phosphorylation by PKC also regulates biochemical and most likely functional properties of annexin II. In a lipid vesicle aggregation assay, PKC phosphorylated annexin II2pl 12 shows a markedly increased Ca 2+ requirement for the aggregation activity when compared to the non-phosphorylated counterpart [18]. Since Ser-ll is shielded by the bound p l l in the preformed annexin II-pl 1 complex [13] PKC phosphorylation occurred exclusively on Ser-25 in these experiments. Thus, phosphate incorporation at Ser-25 can affect a property requiring the lipid binding activity of the annexin II core probably due to a close spatial proximity of Ser-25 and the first repeat of the annexin core [36]. An effect of Ser-25 phosphorylation is also observed when the possible participation of annexin II in CaE+-induced secretion is analyzed in permeabilized chromaffin cells. Here, the annexin II-pl 1 complex is able to partially restore the secretory activity when added to digitonin permeabilized cells, however, only as long as the cells contain cytosolic PKC activity. Moreover, annexin IIepl 12 pre-phosphorylated by PKC can stimulate secretion in PKC-depleted cells indicating that Ser-25 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for a function of the annexin II-pl I complex in CaE+-evoked exocytosis [19]. It is not clear how this relates to the inhibition of vesicle aggregation observed after PKC phosphorylation at Ser-25 (see above), in particular, since annexin II-pl 1 is thought to function in chromaffin granule exocytosis by providing intergranular a n d / o r granule-plasma membrane links ([23]; for review see [ 1]). The combined results indicate that activation of protein kinase C in cells expressing annexin II and p l l would have two consequences with respect to the intracellular regulation of annexin II activities. First, annexin II-pll complexes already formed would be phosphorylated at Ser-25 of the annexin II chains thereby activating a possi-
