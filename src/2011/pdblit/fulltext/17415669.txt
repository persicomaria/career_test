Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include kuru, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans. Rabbits are the only mammalian species reported to be resistant to TSE agents isolated from different species. Rabbits do not develop signs of TSE disease after inoculation with the CJD, kuru, or scrapie agent (Vorberg and Martin, 2003). Thus, to understand the inhibition mechanism at molecular level, we performed a NMR study on rabbit prion, and here we report the NMR resonance assignments of rabbit prion

protein (91­228), which includes 138 residues. Nearly all of the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances were assigned (~99%). Assignments of the side chain atoms are about 90% complete. The assignments have deposited with BMRB accession number 7142.
