Received 30 Janaury 1985 The destructive oxidation of aerobically isolated 7Fe Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I [(7Fe)FdI] by Fe(CN)",- is examined using low-temperature magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and EPR. The results demonstrate that oxidation of the [3Fe-3S] cluster occurs only after essentially complete destruction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. It is therefore feasible by controlled Fe(CN);- oxidation to obtain a partially metallated form of FdI, (3Fe)FdI, containing only a [3Fe-3s) cluster. The MCD and EPR data demonstrate that the [3Fe-3S] cluster in (3Fe)FdI is essentially identical in structure to that in the native protein.

1. INTRODUCTION X-ray crystallography [ 1,2] and Mossbauer spectroscopy [3] have recently shown that Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I [(7Fe)FdI], isolated aerobically, possesses two iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, containing respectively 3 and 4 Fe. (We use the designation (7Fe)FdI, since we have recently shown that ferredoxin I can be reconstituted as an 8Fe, (2[4Fe-4S]`+"+ ) protein: (8Fe)FdI [4].) The [3Fe-3S] cluster [1,2] in (7Fe)FdI as isolated is paramagnetic [3], and thus responsible for the near-isotropic g - 2.01 EPR [5], and is reduced by dithionite [3]. The [4Fe-4SJ cluster is diamagnetic in (7Fe)FdI as isolated [3], reacts with Fe(CN& generating EPR at g - 2.0 [5] and was reported to be not reducible [S] . This behavior led originally to identification of the [4Fe-4S] cluster as a HIPIPtype, [4Fe-4S]2+`3+ cluster [5]. However, we have recently shown [6,7] that (i) the product of the

reaction with Fe(CN$ is not a HIPIP-type cluster and (ii) that at pH z 8 a reduced, [4Fe-4S]`+ cluster EPR can be generated by dithionite; the [4Fe-4S] cluster is thus a low-potential, [4Fe-4S]1+`2+ cluster of the type observed in bacterial ferredoxins. Our studies of the Fe(CN)z- oxidation of isolated (7Fe)FdI, (7Fe)FdI,,, showed that the reaction is progressive and destructive of the Fe-S clusters [6]. At a [Fe(CN)i-] : [(irFe)FdI,,] ratio k 25, UV-visible absorption and circular dichroism (CD) and EPR attributable to Fe-S clusters are eliminated. Initial reaction leads to production of additional g z 2.0 EPR intensity, which is maximised by [Fe(CN)z-] : [(7Fe)FdI,,] - 3. The EPRactive species created possesses unusual EPR and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) characteristics; notably, its liquid helium temperature visiblenear-UV paramagnetic MCD is so weak as to be not observable (in the presence of the paramagnetic [3Fe-3S] cluster). We therefore proposed that the initial Fe(CN)a- reaction involves oxidation of S-containing moieties of the [4Fe-4S12+ cluster in which a radical (specifically, a cysteinyldisulfide radical) is formed.

We now report further studies of the Fe(CN& oxidation of (7Fe)FdI,, by MCD and EPR which show that at [Fe(CN)a-1: [(7Fe)FdI,,,] > 3 the oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster continues to occur preferentially, and that oxidation of the [3Fe-3S] cluster is only initiated following nearly complete [4Fe-4S] cluster destruction. While selective, reversible oxidation of different Fe-S clusters in proteins is well known, selective destructive oxidation is not. The latter is unlikely to be of physiological significance, of course. However, as a route to preparation of partially metallated proteins it is of considerable interest. In the case of (7Fe)FdI, this work shows that it is feasible to prepare a 3Fe form of FdI from which the [4Fe-4S] cluster has been removed and containing only the [3Fe-3S] cluster. This in turn will allow the physical and chemical properties of the [3Fe-3S] cluster to be explored in the absence of background from the [4Fe-4S] cluster, a prospect of particular value in view of current controversy over the uniformity of 3Fe cluster structures [8].

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The visible-near-UV MCD of Fe(CN&-oxidised (7Fe)FdI,, at [Fe(CN&] : [(7Fe)FdI,,] ratios from 0 to -20 was measured at -2 K and -3 tesla. Below 4 K the MCD of (7Fe)FdI,, is attributable entirely to the S = l/2 ground electronic state of the oxidised, [3Fe-3S13+ cluster (the assignment of a 3 + charge to the oxidised [3Fe-3S] cluster follows from the Fe3+ oxidation level of all 3Fe [lo], together with the Fe& core stoichiometry) [5,11]. After oxidation by Fe(CN)i-, the -2 K MCD exhibits the following features: (i) within experimental error, no change in shape occurs; (ii) only at [Fe(CN$-I: [(7Fe)FdI,,J z 10 does the MCD intensity diminish. These results are illustrated in figs 1 and 2. Fig.1 shows the MCD at [Fe(CN&]:[(7Fe)FdI,,,] = 0, 8.5, 13.3 and 20.1, normalized to constant amplitude of difference from 344 nm to 383 nm. This makes clear the constancy in shape of MCD over the entire range of [Fe(CN)a-] : [(7Fe)FdIo,] ratios. Fig.2 plots the variation in absolute MCD intensity, normalized with respect to concentration (c), pathlength (r) and temperature variation using the expression [ll]: AA = (Ac)oc~ tanh(2.0lflH/2k7) (where H is the magnetic field and T is the absolute temperature). This complex expression is required since at -2 K, magnetic fields of -3 tesla cause appreciable saturation of the MCD. From the invariance of MCD shape to Fe(CN& oxidation it follows that (i) at all [Fe(CN)?]: [(`IFe)FdI,,] ratios studied, no unreduced Fe(CN$ remains, since Fe(CN& possesses extremely large paramagnetic MCD; and (ii) no oxidation products, whether bound to the protein or not, exhibit significant paramagnetic MCD in the spectral range studied. As a consequence it follows that (i) the concentration of intact [3Fe-3SJ3+ cluster is directly proportional to the magnitude of the MCD signal and (ii) there is no evidence of change in the structure of the [3Fe-3S13+ cluster during oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, since the shape of its spectrum does not measurably alter. The EPR of Fe(CN)z--oxidised (7Fe)FdI,, at [Fe(CN)a-1: [(7Fe)FdI,,] ratios from 0 to 30 has been measured at 11 and 50 K. At 11 K (7Fe)FdI,, exhibits a sharp, nearly isotropic EPR spectrum with g - 2.01; at 50 K this signal is broadened to undetectability 161. On oxidation with Fe(CN)?, 207

2. MATERIALS

AND METHODS

All materials and methods were as in earlier work [4,6]. Samples of Fe(CN)d--oxidised (7Fe)FdI,, for MCD were prepared by incubation of (7Fe)FdI,, with Fe(CN& until the absorption and CD became constant (the time for equilibration increases with [Fe(CN$] : [(7Fe)FdI,J, being -2 h at a ratio of -20 at the concentration and temperatures employed). Glycerol was added to -50: 50 (v/v). The protein concentration change on addition of glycerol was obtained by absorption and CD, which also confirmed the absence of any perturbation of the protein structure by glycerol. The MCD cell path length was measured prior to freezing using a micrometer. Samples of Fe(CN)i--oxidised (7Fe)FdI,, for EPR were incubated uniformly for 2 h prior to freezing. EPR tubes were calibrated using the room-temperature EPR of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6_tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl free radical. EPR intensities were integrated [9] using 1 mM CuEDTA as a standard. All experiments, subsequent to purification of (7Fe)FdIo,, were anaerobic. 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was used throughout.

the 11 K EPR first broadens, then diminishes in amplitude, as shown in fig.3. At 50 K, an anisotropic signal appears, whose amplitude first increases and then decreases, the shape remaining constant throughout [6]. (The 50 K EPR spectra shown in [6] were obtained after -1 h incubation of (7Fe)FdI,, and Fe(CN)a-. At [Fe(CN)?]:

[(7Fe)FdI,,] B 10, equilibration is incomplete in 1 h and the spectra in [6] exhibit greater EPR intensity than in the fully equilibrated samples used

here.) The maximum integrated intensities of the EPR at 11 and 50 K, which occur at [Fe(CN$] : [(7Fe)FdI,,] close to 3, are 1.7 and 0.8 spin/molecule, respectively. The intensity of the 50 K signal is plotted in fig.2.

As discussed previously [6], the initial oxidation of (7Fe)FdIo, involves 3-electron oxidation of the [4Fe-4S]*+ cluster to a species (labelled [4Fe-4S] `) responsible for the 50 K EPR signal:

The MCD and EPR intensities predicted by sequences 1 and 2 differ, as shown in fig.2. We assume [6], following Petering et al. [12], that the terminal oxidation states of the Fe-S cluster constituents are Fe3+, So and cys-S'. The [3Fe-3S13+ and [4Fe-4S]*+ clusters then require removal of 11 and 14 electrons, respectively, for complete destruction on the basis of stoichiometries of [Fe&(S-cys)s] and [Fe&(S-cys)4], respectively. As fig.2 shows, the experimental data are close to the expectations of sequence 2 and far from those of sequence 1. The differences from the theoretical behavior for sequence 2 can be attributed either to overlapping of subsequent reaction stages (destruction of the [3Fe-3S13+ cluster

beginning prior to complete destruction of [4Fe-4SJ" cluster) or to uncertainties in experimental MCD and EPR intensities (or both). It follows that in the terminal phase of Fe(CN$ oxidation of (7Fe)FdI,,, only two species are present: (3Fe)FdI,, and apo-FdI. Oxidation to this level followed by separation of metalloprotein from apoprotein should then yield homogeneous (3Fe)FdI,,. Further, the MCD and EPR data show that the [3Fe-3S]3f cluster of (3Fe)FdI,, is very little altered by destruction of the [4Fe-4S12+ cluster. The MCD shows no significant change; the 11 K EPR is slightly broader than (7Fe)FdI,,, The physical and chemical properties of the [3Fe-3SJ3+ cluster of (3Fe)FdI*~ should then be directly relevant to those of the [3Fe-3S13+ cluster in (7Fe)FdIox. It should be added, however, that at this time we have no information regarding the disposition of the products of oxidation of the Stand cysteine initially involved in the [4Fe-4SJ2+ cluster. It is possible that cysteine di- and/or trisulfide linkages are formed, either intra- or intermolecularly or both. (3Fe)FdI could therefore be of higher M! than (7Fe)FdI. We are currently pursuing the purification and characterisation of (3Fe)FdI. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.
