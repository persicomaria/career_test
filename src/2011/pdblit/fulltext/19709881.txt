A new series of benzothiazine-substituted quinolinediones were evaluated as inhibitors of HCV polymerase NS5B. SAR studies on this series revealed a methyl sulfonamide group as a high affinity feature. Analogues with this group showed submicromolar potencies in the HCV cell based replicon assay. Pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies were also performed on a selected compound (34) to evaluate in vivo properties of this new class of inhibitors of HCV NS5B polymerase. Ó 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviridae family which was first characterized in 1989 as the major cause of non-A and non-B hepatitis infections.1 About 170 million people, 3% of the global human population, are infected with HCV and an estimated 3 million individuals become newly infected each year.2 HCV has been found to be a major cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as liver failure, and is the most common cause of the need for liver transplantation. HCV is most commonly transmitted by blood transfusions, hemodialysis, and intravenous drug use, and is quite insidious in that clinical manifestations can be mild or non-existent for years after initial infection. Currently there are no vaccines available to prevent hepatitis C. The current gold standard therapies are based upon the use of pegylated interferon-a-2a in combination with ribavirin. These therapies provide a sustained virological response in approximately 50% of patients infected with genotype 1, and have the disadvantage of frequent and severe side effects.3 The cloning of HCV in 1989 eventually led to identification of several targets for small

molecule intervention in the virus life cycle. In the literature, most reports relate to inhibitors of NS3/NS4A protease/helicase and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. With no known mammalian equivalent, HCV polymerase NS5B represents an attractive target for the development of novel anti-HCV agents.4 A series of benzothiadiazine-substituted quinolinedione compounds (i.e., 1) were first reported in 2002 by GSK as HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitors (Fig. 1).5,6 Our own analysis of 1 showed excellent activity against the NS5B polymerase, but in contrast to a recent report,6b we observed low in vivo exposure. We attributed the low in vivo exposure to poor solubility resulting from the extensive internal hydrogen bond network between the quinolinedione and benzothiadiazine rings. We recently reported on a new series of thiazinebased analogs,7a where one of the benzothiadiazine ring internal hydrogen bonds was disrupted by exchanging of one of the N atoms with a CH group. This new benzothiazine series (i.e., 2) showed promising low micromolar potency and had a decreased melting point, slightly improved solubility, and significantly enhanced pharmacokinetic properties (Fig. 1). Herein, we report on our expanded lead optimization studies of the benzothiazine-substituted quinolinedione series as inhibitors of the HCV NS5B polymerase.7b

Our general synthesis of variously substituted benzothiazinesubstituted quinolinediones is presented in Scheme 1. The quinolinedione fragment was derived from isotoic anhydrides such as 3. These were prepared by either direct alkylation of commercially available isotoic anhydrides (4) or by copper catalyzed amination of ortho bromo benzoic acids (5) followed by treatment with triphosgene. The synthesis of the benzothiazine core started by an alkylation of 2-aminobenzenethiols (6) with ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate followed by an intramolecular condensation providing benzothiazine 7. The benzothiazine nitrogen was protected with a BOC group and the sulfide oxidized to a sulfone group using mchloroperbenzoic acid. Removal of the BOC protecting group under acidic conditions gave benzothiazine 8. Deprotonation of benzothiazine ester 8 with potassium tert-butoxide followed by treatment with an isotoic anhydride 3 led to the desired benzothiazinesubstituted quinolinediones (9) in one pot.8 A number of structurally diverse compounds synthesized in an analogous manner were evaluated in a biochemical assay against HCV polymerase NS5B.9 In addition, the activities of these compounds in cell culture against HCV subgenomic replicon (GT-1b) were also determined.10,11 These data are summarized in Table 1 below. Our initial benzothiazine 2 showed improved in vivo properties but low microsomal stability and poor inhibitory activity (Fig. 1). During our initial explorations,7a we found that replacement of the cyclopropylethyl side chain by a p-fluorobenzyl group led to a slight improvement in inhibitory activity (compound 10 vs. com-

pound 2, Table 1). Thus, we commenced our structure activity relationship studies on benzothiazine-substituted quinolonediones with a p-fluorobenzyl group. Our initial work was focused on improving the inhibitory activity by addition of a substituent to the C-7 position of the benzothiazine ring. Incorporation of small groups such as fluorine or hydroxyl led to an improvement in enzyme potency with no improvement in our replicon assay (compounds 11 and 13). In contrast, incorporation of a methyl sulfonamide group led to a significant improvement in both enzyme and replicon potency (compound 18). Other polar groups such as N-acetyl (17) or methyl sulfone (22) did not provide required levels of potency. Extension of the methyl sulfonamide group or other polar groups did not improve inhibitory activity (15, 16 and 21).

A crystal structure of compound 18 complexed with the enzyme was obtained (Figs. 2 and 3)12 and confirmed our earlier hypothesis that the thiazine inhibitors do indeed bind in the palm site of the NS5B polymerase, near the catalytic site. The quinolinedione and benzothiazine rings adopted a nearly co-planar geometry, while the benzothiazine ring displays a shallow U-shaped bend nearly identical with that predicted by our previous modeling study.7a The phenyl group of the quinolinedione is positioned in a hydrophobic site organized by Met414 and Gly410. The quinolinedione also serves as an anchor point for the fluorobenzyl lipophilic tail that fills a hydrophobic pocket shaped by Tyr448, Cys366 and Tyr415. Quinolinedione 18 binds to the palm I site as an anion due to its ionization at physiological pH (experimental pKa = 3.8). The anionic charge is conveniently delocalized on this cyclic 1,3-dicarbonyl functionality which interacts with two conserved water molecules and the backbone N­H of Tyr448. The benzothiazine ring system makes an edge to face interaction with Phe193. One of the sulfone oxygens interacts with a structural water molecule bridging to Ser556 and the methyl sulfonamide group. The sulfonamide group also interacts with the NS5B residue Asn291. The acidic N­H of the sulfonamide group makes a strong hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Asp318. This unique three point interaction of the sulfonamide group helps explain the 50-fold boost in potency observed upon incorporation this polar group. Once the methyl sulfonamide was discovered as a high affinity polar group, we focused our efforts on optimizing lipophilic interactions on the quinolinedione core (Table 2). We evaluated the in vitro potency in our NS5B enzyme assay and HCV subgenomic replicon cell based assay in the presence of 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). The effect of protein binding on the efficiency of the inhibitors was quantified by a plasma shifted replicon assay, which uses 40% Human Serum Albumin (HSA). Addition of small substituents, such as fluorine or chlorine, were tolerated at any position of the quinoline ring. Since addition of a fluorine atom at the C-6 position of the quinoline ring provided a boost in potency (compound 18) and blocks this site from further metabolism via para-hydroxylation, we choose this substitution pattern for further optimization. We next turned our attention to the optimization of the lipophilic benzyl substituent (Table 3). The benzyl group is often

metabolized at the para position or on the benzylic carbon. In order to block any metabolism, halogens were incorporated on the meta and para positions. With this aim, pyridyl groups were also evaluated. Among this set of diverse aromatic groups the p-fluorobenzyl group provided adequate levels of potency in our enzyme and cell based assays. Incorporation of a methyl group at the meta position in the p-fluorobenzyl series provided an added boost in potency in our PS replicon assay (34). Several alkyl groups were also evaluated. Surprisingly, small alkyl groups (41) were as potent as the benzyl groups, but were not metabolically stable. Thus, compound 34 became our key lead structure. In addition to having excellent in vitro potency, 34 also demonstrated adequate physical chemical properties for this series and was therefore selected for in vivo pharmacokinetics studies. The requirement of multigram quantities led us to optimize the original synthesis (Scheme 2). The large scale synthesis of benzothiazine commenced from 6-nitrobenzothiazole (46). The thiazole ring of 46 was opened under basic conditions and then doubly alkylated in situ upon treatment with ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate, providing benzothiazine core 47 as a 1:1 mixture of exocyclic olefin isomers. The benzothiazine sulfur was oxidized selectively by treatment with potassium permanganate at low temperature to prevent over oxidation. Ester 48 was deprotonated and then treated with isotoic anhydride 45, which was readily obtained by reductive alkylation of anthranilic acid 43 followed by anhydride formation. Selective reduction of the nitro group with Raney-nickel, followed by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in pyridine, led to a mixture of mono and disulfonylated benzothianes. This mixture was converted to the desired monosulfonylated benzothiazine 34 following treatment with aqueous sodium hydroxide. In vivo pharmacokinetic data was obtained for compound 34 following administration of single intravenous and oral doses to rats or dogs (Table 4). The limited intravenous plasma concentration of 34 in rat was attributed to high first pass clearance (186 mL/kg/min). The rat plasma clearance was ca. threefold higher than rat liver blood flow, but was inconsistent with the observed high rat hepatocyte stability in vitro (1.6 lL/min/106cells). In contrast to the rat data, 34 displayed moderate clearance and good

exposure in dogs at lower dose. In addition to better microsomal stability in dog versus rat, 34 is highly protein bound (99.8% HSA) and it is possible that interspecies protein binding variations may partly explain the reduced clearance in dog. Although the lowdose oral exposure of 34 in both species was quite low, rat liver levels at 2 and 6 h confirmed that higher exposure in the target organ was possible. In order to better assess the effects of increasing po doses of 34, a seven day rat toxicology study was performed using both female and male rats (Table 5). There were no toxicological findings observed in this study: NOAEL > 500 mkd (AUC ca. 1700 ng h/mL). However, the ability of higher doses of 34 to overwhelm clearance mechanisms was less than expected and exposures were generally low. Regardless, compound 34 showed good dose proportionality and a liver-to-plasma ratio of ca. 10 after 24 h. The liver accumulation on day eight was also in line with a ca. 2.6-fold plasma accumulation. The poor levels of exposure of compound 34 were attributed to low solubility (6.7 lg/mL) and high rat clearance. To address the effects of solubility versus permeability and evaluate exposure levels in a different species, 34 was dosed in dog using three different dosage formulations (Fig. 4). Oral administration of 2 mg/kg to female dogs using either normal or nanosized particles, or via cannulated delivery of a fully solubilized intraduodenal dose all showed low levels of exposure with Cmax below 15 ng/mL.

in both standard and plasma shifted cell based assays. We have developed a short and convergent synthesis of these compounds that allowed for rapid evaluation and scale up. In vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation of compound 34 demonstrated good dose proportionality and a favorable toxicological profile. Pharmacokinetic studies also revealed poor exposure due to low absorption. Template modifications focused on improving the physicochemical properties of this scaffold will be reported in subsequent publications. Acknowledgments The authors thank Drs.
