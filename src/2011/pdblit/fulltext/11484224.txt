ABSTRACT The structure of the bark lectin RPbAI (isoform A4) from Robinia pseudoacacia has been determined by protein crystallography both in the free form and complexed with N-acetylgalactosamine. The free form is refined at 1.80 Å resolution to an R-factor of 18.9% whereas the complexed structure has an R-factor of 19.7% at 2.05 Å resolution. Both structures are compared to each other and to other available legume lectin structures. The polypeptide chains of the two structures exhibit the characteristic legume lectin tertiary fold. The quaternary structure resembles that of the Phaseolus vulgaris lectin, the soybean agglutinin, and the Dolichos biflorus lectin, but displays some unique features leading to the extreme stability of this lectin.

Key words: legume lectin; Robinia pseudoacacia; sugar­protein interactions; tetramer; protein crystallography INTRODUCTION Lectins are a heterogeneous group of proteins that bind carbohydrates in a reversible way but lack any enzymatic activity toward these carbohydrates. Lectins are ubiquitous in nature and are found in animals, plants, bacteria, and viruses. They are mainly involved in biological recognition and play important roles in cancer, inflammation, and immune response. Plant lectins, in particular, have proven to be valuable tools in different areas of biological and medical research, e.g., immunology, glycobiology, and the purification and characterization of complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates.1 However, despite their extensive use in these fields, little is known about their biological role in the plants. Currently it is assumed that they might play a role in the plant's defense against predators. The legume lectins form a large family of carbohydratebinding proteins occurring in seeds and various vegetative tissues of plants belonging to the Leguminosae family.1,2 Despite the strong similarity in their amino acid sequences and tertiary structures, legume lectins exhibit marked differences in carbohydrate-binding specificity and quaternary structure.3,4 Structural analysis could pinpoint these differences to the binding sites and the interfaces between the monomers. Though numerous legume lectins have already been studied by X-ray crystallography,5 many other members of this lectin family with

interesting carbohydrate-binding properties and/or biological activities still wait to be resolved at the atomic level. An interesting group of poorly studied legume lectins are the carbohydrate-binding proteins from the bark of Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust). Biochemical and molecular studies demonstrated that black locust bark expresses three genes encoding three different lectin polypeptides. One of these genes encodes lectin polypeptide C (26 kDa) that associates exclusively into homotetramers (called Robinia pseudoacacia bark agglutinin II or RPbAII). Two other genes encode lectin polypeptides A and B (31.5 and 29 kDa, respectively), which associate in all possible combinations into five different tetrameric isolectins (A4, A3B, A2B2, AB3, and B4).6 The mixture of these five isoforms is called Robinia pseudoacacia bark agglutinin I (RPbAI).6 The carbohydrate-binding specificity of RPbAI was studied based on its ability to agglutinate a 2% suspension of rabbit erythrocytes. This hemagglutination can only be inhibited by a series of galactose-related sugars with a decreasing strength of inhibition in the following order: N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, lactose, methyl -D-galactopyranoside, D-fucose (6-deoxy-D-galactose), D-galactose. Inhibition did not occur using D-mannose, D-glucose, N-acetylD-glucosamine, methyl -D-mannopyranoside, L-fucose, 7 D-xylose, sucrose, D-mannitol, or D-sorbitol. Furthermore, RPbAI exhibits other interesting biological activities. When orally administered to rats in low or moderate doses, the lectin acts as a growth factor in the small intestine where it induces hyperplastic growth by stimulating crypt cell proliferation.8 Though the potent mitogenic activity of RPbAI toward the crypt cells is not fully understood, the

observed effects are reminiscent of the reactions brought about by "classical" mitogens like phytohemagglutinin (PHA-L) in lymphocytes. Ingestion of high doses of purified RPbAI causes acute nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The eventual discomfort is so severe that the experimental animals refuse to continue eating the lectin-containing diet. In this respect, RPbAI behaves like PHA-L, which has been studied in great detail for what concerns its toxicity toward mammals. Though not commonly known, PHA-L is a highly toxic protein. For example, a dose equivalent to the content of 4 ­5 raw beans is sufficient to kill an adult human. This explains why insufficiently cooked beans cause accidental poisoning. At present, it is generally accepted that PHA-L plays a role in plant defense against seed predating animals and that a similar role can be attributed to other toxic lectins.1,9 Since RPbAI is even more toxic than PHA-L8, and, in addition, accounts for approximately 50% of the total protein in the bark of black locust trees,9 it has been suggested that RPbAI contributes to the protection of the bark against herbivorous animals.9 In spite of its toxicity, RPbAI offers interesting perspectives for medical and therapeutical applications when administered at the right dose. Recently, a patent was published that mentions the use of RPbAI to treat diseases of the gastrointestinal tract including mucositis (patent no. PCT/GB98/02612). These applications too apparently rely on the mitogenic activity of the lectin on human and animal cells. To corroborate both the mitogenic activity and presumed defensive role of the black locust bark lectin, it would be helpful to determine the fine specificity and 3-D structure of the binding sites. Therefore, crystallographic studies were started to resolve the structure of RPbAI and its sugar complexes and some stability studies were performed. Since the complex mixture of isoforms was not suited for the envisaged structural studies, we focused on the homotetramer consisting of four 31.5-kDa subunits (A4) in its native form. In order to study the sugar-binding site of this legume lectin,

the complex between RPbAI A4 and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) was also structurally investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS RPbAI was purified from the bark of Robinia pseudoacacia by affinity chromatography on immobilized fetuin and isoform A4 was isolated from a total RPbAI preparation by ion-exchange chromatography using a Mono-S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).6 This sample was used for crystallization experiments and for stability studies. Crystals suitable for diffraction analysis were grown from 0.2 M ammonium sulfate containing 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 as described elsewhere.10 Crystals of the complex between RPbAI and GalNAc were prepared by soaking an uncomplexed RPbAI crystal with a 50 mM GalNAc solution for approximately 48 h. Both the uncomplexed and the complexed crystals could be cryoprotected with 20% sucrose using the original crystallization conditions. Data collection with cryo-cooling at 100 K was carried out using synchrotron radiation. Uncomplexed crystals were measured at the X11 beam line of the DESY synchrotron in Hamburg (1.8 Å) whereas data of the RBbAI-GalNAc crystals were collected to 2.05 Å at the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste. All data processing was done using DENZO and SCALEPACK.11 The space group was determined to be I222 with a 64.08 Å, b 75.85 Å, c 118.09 Å for the uncomplexed crystal form10 and a 64.62 Å, b 76.23 Å, c 118.24 Å for the complexed crystals. The calculated Matthews coefficient of 2.27 Å3 Da 1 suggests that in both cases the asymmetric unit consists of a single monomer.12 Statistics for both data sets are given in Table I. The phase problem for both structures was solved using the molecular replacement technique in X-PLOR.13 The coordinates of the A monomer of phytohemagglutinin-L (PDB code 1FAT)14 were used as a search model for the uncomplexed RPbAI structure and the final model of the

uncomplexed structure (after removal of all water molecules) was used for the molecular replacement on the complex structure. The correct solution in the rotation search stood out as a 2.72 peak above the next peak for the uncomplexed structure and as a 3.20 peak above the next peak for the complexed structure. The R-factors after initial rigid body refinement to 3 Å were 45.80 and 30.74%, respectively. Refinement of both structures was performed in the CNS package15 using torsional angle dynamics and individual B-factor refinement. A randomly selected 10% of the data sets were set aside for cross-validation using the R-free value. Bulk solvent correction was used. Solvent molecules were progressively added when they met the following requirements: (1) a minimum 3 peak had to be present in the Fobs Fcalc difference map, (2) a peak had to be visible in the 2 Fobs Fcalc map, (3) during refinement, the B-value for the water molecule should not exceed 60 Å2, and (4) the water molecule had to be stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Visual inspection and model building were done in O.16 Electron and difference density maps were employed to confirm the presence of the GalNAc molecule in the structure of the RPbAI-Gal-NAc structure. Subsequently, parameter and topology files for refinement of the structure including the GalNAc molecule were created with XPLO2D17 based on the coordinates of GalNAc from the structure of Dolichos biflorus (PDB code 1LU2).18 In order to fit the electron density accurately, several amino acids had to be mutated with respect to the primary sequence that is deposited in the SWISS-PROT database (accession no. Q41159). These changes include Phe20Asn, Gly44Ser, Ser74Thr, Thr83Ala, Val103Leu, His133Asn, Phe134Trp, Met141Leu, Val149Glu, Val192Ile, and His193Asp. The decision to mutate these residues was in each case reinforced based either on the shape of the electron density (in 2 Fobs Fcalc maps and in Fobs Fcalc difference maps), on the formation of hydrogen bonds with neighboring residues and waters or on the presence of that particular residue in other RPbAI isoforms with known sequence (e.g., the sequence presented by Yoshida et al.19). The observed differences are probably due to the known heterogeneity of the bark lectins in Robinia pseudoacacia. Furthermore, two side chains (Arg22 and Ile132) were completely disordered and had to be replaced by a Gly. The presence of all the mutations, the water molecules, and the ions were checked in simulated annealing omit maps. Assessment of the quality of the coordinates was done with the programs PROCHECK20 and Moleman.21 GRASP22 was used to calculate the molecular surfaces and the buried surfaces23 of the RPbAI monomer involved in the dimeric and tetrameric interfaces. The electrostatic potentials were calculated and displayed with GRASP using the parse3 parameters.22 The solvent probe radius used for the molecular surfaces was 1.4 Å and a standard 2.0 Å-Stern layer was used to exclude ions from the molecular surface.24 The inner and outer dielectric constants applied to the protein and the solvent were fixed at 4.0 and 80.0, respectively, and the calculations were performed keeping the ionic strength equivalent to 0.150

M NaCl. No even distribution of the net negative charge of the carboxylic group of negatively charged residues was performed between their two oxygens prior to the calculations. The docking of galactose (Gal) into the carbohydratebinding site of RPbAI was performed on a Silicon Graphics O2 R10000 workstation using the programs InsightII, Homology, and Discover (Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA). The lowest apparent binding energy (Ebind expressed in kcal.mol 1) compatible with the hydrogen bonds (considering van der Waals interactions and strong and weak hydrogen bonds) found in the RPbAI-GalNAc was calculated with the cvff force field and used to anchor the pyranose ring of Gal into the binding site of RPbAI. Hydrogen bonds are considered strong when 2.5 Å distance(D­A) 3.1 Å and 120° angle(D­H­A) and weak when 2.5 Å distance(D­A) 3.5 Å and 105° angle (D­H­A) 120° (with D: donor, A: acceptor, and H: hydrogen). Cartoons were rendered using Molscript25 and Raster3D.26 The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank27 with the codes 1FNY and 1FNZ. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION RPbAI Is an Unusually Stable Legume Lectin Legume lectins are stable proteins both in structural and functional terms. Most but not all legume lectins remain active in a pH range between 3 and 10, and can be reversibly dissociated by denaturants. Though they withstand heating up to 50 ­55°C most legume lectins are irreversibly inactivated at temperatures above 60 ­ 65°C. To corroborate the possible defensive role of RPbAI against herbivorous animals, stability studies have been done previously to check whether the lectin can survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract.8 In vitro studies indicated that RPbAI remains fully active in a pH range between 2 and 12, which is unusual even for a legume lectin, and that the lectin resists gut proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin. All legume lectins consist of two or four noncovalently bound protomers. Both the dimeric and tetrameric native lectins are stable at neutral pH and in the absence of denaturing agents. However, upon lowering or increasing

the pH or the addition of denaturants like urea or guanidinium chloride, most legume lectins lose their original structure. Dimeric lectins dissociate into monomers and tetrameric lectins first dissociate into dimers and eventually into monomers. For example, tetrameric concanavalin A dissociates below pH 5.6 into dimers, and is completely

dissociated into monomers in 8 M urea. In a previous study of the biological activities of RPbAI, we attempted to dissociate native RPbAI to purify individual A and B chains for specificity and activity studies of the two distinct subunits of RPbAI.6 These dissociation studies indicated that RPbAI displays a very high structural

stability. Using gel filtration under different conditions, we observed that RPbAI retains its tetrameric structure between pH 2 and 12. Surprisingly, RPbAI occurs also as a tetramer in a solution of 8 M urea or 6 M guanidinium chloride, which indicates that the lectin is highly resistant against these denaturants. No other legume lectin exhibits such a high structural stability. For example, in the same set of experiments, PHA-L fully dissociated in 8 M urea and 6 M guanidinium chloride. Only upon addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate, RPbAI dissociates into its composing subunits. Uncomplexed RPbAI Structure The final model converged to an R-factor of 18.90% and an R-free value of 21.15 % (Table II). It comprises 234 out of the total 254 amino acid residues, 176 water molecules, and one calcium ion. The C-terminal residues (238 ­254) are disordered in a solvent-filled channel that is formed by the tetrameric assembly of the structure. The quaternary structure of RPbAI consists, indeed, of a tetramer (dimensions approximately 40 Å 60 Å 80 Å) that is similar to that of Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin PHA-L,14 soybean agglutinin SBA,28 Vicia villosa isolectin B4,29 Ulex europaeus agglutinin-II UEA-II,30 and Dolichos biflorus lectin DBL.18 As stated above, the asymmetric unit of RPbAI consists of only one monomer, but the complete tetramer, consisting of two canonical legume lectin dimers that pack against each other in a parallel fashion, is generated by the I222 crystallographic symmetry. The canonical dimers originate from the formation of a continuous, curved, antiparallel 12-stranded -sheet spanning two monomers, whereas the interface between the two canonical dimers on its turn is situated at the outer ends of the tetramer and consists of two -strands that pack together by the zipperlike intercalation of their side chains (Fig. 1). The model has good geometry and has r.m.s. deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles of 0.005 Å and 1.422°,

respectively. Subsequently, 89.4% of the residues could be found in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot; 10.1 % were in the allowed regions and 0.5 % were in the generously allowed regions. None of the residues was found in the disallowed regions [Fig. 2(a)]. The average temperature factor for the main-chain and side-chain atoms are 13.46 Å2 and 15.96 Å2, respectively. One loop region has significantly higher B-factors (loop 111­120),

and due to this disorder the residues 112 to 114 could not be built unambiguously in the electron density. Further refinement statistics are given in Table I. In Figure 3, one RPbAI monomer is shown. It adopts the typical jelly-roll motif of legume lectins in which a nearly flat six-stranded back -sheet (B-sheet) and a curved seven-stranded front -sheet (F-sheet) are held together by a small top -sheet (S-sheet). As in other legume lectin monomers,3 the highly conserved Asp87 exhibits a cispeptide bond. Four conserved sugar-binding residues (Asp87, Gly105, Phe129, and Asn131) occupy positions similar to those in other legume lectins and the monosaccharide-binding site is occupied by 4 well-defined water molecules. In addition, the Ca2 binding site coordinated by four amino acids (Asp127 O 1 and O 2, Phe129 O, Asp131 O 1, and Asn135 O 1) is conserved. The heptacoordinance of Ca2 is satisfied by two additional bonds with two water molecules that themselves are hydrogen bonded to Trp134 N 2 and Asp87 O 1. Although the amino acids residues (Glu125, Asp127, Asp135, and His140) responsible for the binding of the Mn2 ion are conserved, the RPbAI does apparently not contain a transition metal ion at this position. Trying to build this Mn2 ion in the positive electron density at the conserved location resulted in very high B-factors for this ion, demonstrating that this

ion was not present. Only an extra water molecule could fit this position adequately. The absence of the Mn2 ion in the crystal structure is a logical consequence of the low Mn2 content in the protein sample (20 ppb) as observed from inductive coupled plasma atomic- mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) measurements. Since no extra Mn2 was added to the crystallization condition, the measured quantity is not nearly sufficient for stoichiometric RPbAI-Mn2 binding in the crystals. From the primary structure of RPbAI, two regions with the sequence Asn­X­Thr/Ser could be identified as potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (Asn116 and Asn157). However, the electron density yields evidence that glycosylation occurs only at Asn157 and not at Asn116. Large residual density could be observed near Asn157, but the exact location of the sugar moieties (GlcNAc­Fuc­GlcNAc) could not be determined unambiguously. Hence, attempts to build the bound carbohydrate molecule into the map and refine it, failed. However, the glycan chains, which presumably protrude from the N-glycosylation site, are oriented toward the solvent in such a way that they cannot prevent the dimer or tetramer formation. The structural differences between the RPbAI monomer and some other legume lectins that adopt the same tetrameric assembly (PHA-L, SBA, DBL) are mainly confined to the loop regions and the N-terminal region (Fig. 4). The C r.m.s. differences between RPbAI and PHA-L, SBA, and DBL are 7.220 Å, 6.392 Å, and 5.248 Å, respectively. When only the residues in the conserved secondary structure elements are considered, the C r.m.s. differences are a lot smaller: 0.453 Å, 0.432 Å, and 0.482 Å, respectively (for 98 superimposed residues). The largest rearrangements can be found in loop 111­119. However, in all the compared structures this loop is very flexible with very high B-values, indicating that the observed structural differences are probably not significant. Other changes can be found in loop 10 ­16: this loop region in RPbAI adopts a similar conformation as that of SBA, while the same loop is found in another conformation in DBL and PHA-L. This effect can be explained by the fact that in DBL and PHA-L, the loop is two residues shorter than in RPbAI and SBA. A similar situation occurs in loop 79 ­ 85: for this loop, RPbAI has an identical conformation as SBA, whereas in PHA-L and DBL this loop adopts another conformation. However, in this case the number of residues in the loop is identical for all four structures. Here, the observed structural differences are possibly due to crystal contacts with molecules from another tetramer (residues 146 ­147 in RPbAI). Despite all the aforementioned differences in loop regions, it can be concluded that the overall structure of RPbAI is very similar to all other legume lectin monomers. However, with respect to the tetrameric assembly, RPbAI displays some unique features compared to its structural homologues (DBL, PHA-L, SBA). The interfaces between two dimers correspond to strands 3, 4, and 5 of the back faces of two monomers. Besides two direct hydrogen bonds connecting Asn165 N 2 [strand 3F] to Glu171 O 2 [strand 3F] (2.83 Å) and Glu187 O 2 [strand 5F] to Ile195 [strand 5F] (2.85 Å) of two facing dimers,

most of the hydrogen bonds are mediated by water molecules that form an extended network between both dimers (Table III). Most of the hydrophilic residues occurring in strands 3F (Asn165, Ser169, Glu171), 4F (Ser176, Ser180), and 5F (Glu187, Ser189, Asp193) of both dimers become interconnected through this network of water molecules. The resulting strong hydrophilic interaction occurring between the two dimers presumably accounts for the extreme stability observed for the RPbAI tetramer. Additional van der Waals interactions between exposed residues of the back faces of the dimers reinforce this stability. In addition, the buried interface responsible for the association of the two dimers is by far more extended than those observed in the closely related tetrameric assemblies of PHA-L, DBL, and UEA-II (Table IV). Accordingly, the hydrophilic water channel observed in the center of the RPbAI tetramer is narrower than that occurring in the PHA-L or DBL tetramers (Fig. 5) and this despite the fact that all these tetrameric structures exhibit very similar negatively charged surfaces. Taking into account that the buried interface allowing two RPbAI monomers to form a typical dimer is also rather extended, the extreme stability of the RPbAI tetramer can be explained. In this respect, the RPbAI tetramer differs strikingly from other structurally related tetrameric forms found in PHA-L, DBL, and UEA-II. RPbAI-GalNAc Structure The model containing 234 amino acids, 150 water molecules, 1 Ca2 ion, and 1 GalNAc molecule has a final R-factor of 19.74% (R-free 22.19%) (Table II). Also in this structure, the C-terminal region and the loop region from

residue 112 to 114 could not be observed in the electron density. The r.m.s. deviation from ideal bond lengths and angles is 0.006 Å and 1.392°, and the average B-factors for the main-chain and side-chain atoms are 23.59 Å2 and 25.68 Å2, respectively (Table I). A Ramachandran plot for this RPbAI can be seen in Figure 2(b). Comparison of the backbone atoms of the uncomplexed and the complexed structures shows that they are quite similar. The r.m.s. deviation between them is 0.111 Å, based on the superposition of the C atoms. This is in agreement with the observations of Delbaere et al.31: unlike in glucose/mannose-specific lectins where structural rearrangements can be observed upon sugar binding,32­34 galactose-specific lectins usually do not change upon binding. Clear density is seen for the bound GalNAc molecule in the carbohydrate-binding site, which is composed of four loops and is located at the concave top front of the monomer (Fig. 3). Three of these loops are conserved (Asp97­Ile109, Thr128 ­Gly138, and Ile77­Asp87 in RPbAI) and provide the structural framework for carbohydrate binding whereas the fourth loop (Gly215­Thr223) with a variable sequence and length determines the sugar specificity. All four loops interact via hydrogen bonds (Table V) and van der Waals interactions with the GalNAc molecule (Fig. 6). The aromatic side chain of Phe129 stacks against the pyranose ring and eight structure-defining hydrogen bonds are formed. Asp87, which is involved in a cis-peptide bond with the preceding Ala, hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl groups at position 3 and 4 of the GalNAc residue. Asn131 forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group at position 3 of GalNAc via its N 2 atom and the backbone amide group of Gly105 is involved in a bifurcated hydrogen bond with O3 and the oxygen (O7) of the N-acetyl group. The N-acetyl group is further anchored by a hydrogen bond between O7 and a water molecule located at the edge of the carbohydrate-binding site. Interestingly, this water molecule does not occur in the unbound RPbAI structure. Additional hydrogen bonds are formed between Ile216 N and O4, and between Asp217 O 1 and O6 and O5, where both residues belong to the so-called specificity loop. In addition to hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions play an important role. The side chains of Trp134 and Met106 form a hydrophobic pocket in the vicinity of the GalNAc methyl group, and Tyr220, which is situated in the specificity loop, makes a favorable hydrophobic interaction with

Fig. 6. Stereo drawing of the network of 8 hydrogen bonds (dotted lines) connecting GalNAc (thick lines) to amino acid residues (thin lines) of the carbohydrate-binding site of RPbAI. O7 of GalNAc also creates a hydrogen bond with a water molecule (H2O) present on the edge of the binding site. A stacking interaction occurs between the pyranose ring of GalNAc and the aromatic ring of Phe129 (heavy lines).

Fig. 7. Electrostatic potential mapped onto the molecular surface of RPbAI (A), DBL (B), and EcorL (C). The structures are all in the same orientation and coloured as red (negative potential 6kT/q) and blue (positive potential 6kT/q). The carbohydrate-binding sites occupied by GalNAc are similarly negatively charged.

C6. The GalNAc molecule is not involved in any interactions with symmetry-related lectin molecules. O1 and O2 are oriented towards the solvent and do not participate in the binding of GalNAc to the carbohydrate-binding site. The above-described mode of binding is very similar to that found in the Dolichos biflorus seed lectin (DBL).18 When superimposing the sugar-binding sites of these lectins using the C atoms of the four conserved sugar-binding residues (Asp87, Gly105, Phe129, Asn131 for RPbAI and Asp 85, Gly103, Leu127, Asn129 for DBL), these four residues occupy almost identical positions (r.m.s.d. of 0.093 Å). The replacement of Phe129 by Leu127 in DBL is responsible for the loss of the aromatic stacking in the DBL-GalNAc complex and further differences in sugar binding between the two lectin structures are mainly confined to the specificity loop. The sequence of this specificity loop of RPbAI is highly homologous to that of DBL, except that in DBL, Ser215 is replaced by Asp216. As a result of this, the O5 atom of GalNAc is closer to the side chain of this residue (4.45 Å in DBL as opposed to 3.23 Å in RPbAI). Despite these differences, the GalNAc binding sites of RPbAI and DBL appear as very

similarly sized acidic cavities on the molecular surfaces of both lectins (Fig. 7). The above-described bonding scheme readily differs from that observed in the Erythrina corallodendron lectin (EcorL)35 where no hydrogen bonds occur between the protein and O7 of GalNAc, and also O5 has no contacts with the carbohydrate-binding site. According to these discrepancies and even though its carbohydrate-binding site closely resembles that of RPbAI and DBL, EcorL exhibits no marked preference for GalNAc and accommodates Gal and GalNAc equally well. Docking experiments performed with Gal gave a similar network of seven hydrogen bonds connecting O3, O4, and O5 to Asp87, Gly105, Asn131, Ile216, and Asp217. However, the hydrogen bond connecting O4 to Ile216 is rather weak (3.29 Å). In addition, the absence of an N-acetyl group decreases the strength of the interaction due to the suppression of the hydrogen bond connecting O7 of GalNAc to the NH group of Gly105 and the van der Waals contacts of the N-acetyl group with residues Trp134 and Ile216. As a result, RPbAI exhibits a higher preference for GalNAc

than for Gal as measured in hapten inhibition experiments.6 CONCLUSIONS The structures of RPbAI and of the RPbAI-GalNAc complex have been determined at 1.8 Å and 2.05 Å resolution, respectively. Both structures adopt the typical jelly-roll motif of the legume lectins and their tetrameric assembly is closely related to that of PHA-L, SBA, DBL, and UEA-I. However, some interesting features in its tetrameric structure (i.e., an extended buried interface and an extended water-mediated network between two dimers) can explain the extreme stability of this legume lectin compared to other legume lectins. This fact is important to corroborate the suggested defensive role of RPbAI against herbivorous animals. No major structural rearrangements can be observed in RPbAI upon carbohydrate binding.
