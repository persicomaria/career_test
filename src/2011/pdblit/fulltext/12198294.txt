Analysis of quinazoline and pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine N9ÐC10 reversed-bridge antifolates in complex with NADP+ and Pneumocystis carinii dihydrofolate reductase
Structural studies of two ternary complexes of Pneumocystis carinii dihydrofolate reductase (pcDHFR) with the cofactor NADP+ and potent antifolates, the N9ÐC10 reversed-bridge inhibitor 2,4-diamino-6-[N-(2H ,5H -dimethoxybenzyl)-N-methylamino]quinazoline (1) and its 3H ,5H -dimethoxypyrido[2,3d]pyrimidine analog (2), were carried out. Data for the Ê monoclinic crystals were re®ned to 1.90 A resolution for the Ê complex with (1) (R = 0.178) and to 2.1 A resolution for the complex with (2) (R = 0.193). The effect of the N9ÐC10 reversed-bridge geometry is to distort the bridge from coplanarity with the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine or quinazoline ring system and to twist the C10 methylene conformation toward a gauche conformation. This change also in¯uences the conformation of the methoxybenzyl ring, moving it away from a trans position. This change places the 5H -methoxy group deeper within the hydrophobic pocket made by Ile65, Pro66 and Phe69 of the pcDHFR active site. These results also revealed the ®rst observation of an unusual conformation for the reversed-bridge geometry (C5ÐC6ÐN9ÐC10 torsion angle) in antifolate (2). The electron density is consistent with the presence of two models (conformers 2-1 and 2-2) that result from inversion of the geometry at N9. The four examples of N9ÐC10 reversed-bridge antifolates cluster in two conformations, with the structure of quinazoline (1) similar to that previously reported for its 2H ,5H -dimethoxypyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine analog (3). The two conformers of (2) differ from these and each other by a twisted-bridge geometry that results in the dimethoxybenzyl ring occupying the same conformational space. Conformer 2-2 also has the N9ÐC10 reversed bridge perpendicular to the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine plane, in contrast to the gauche±trans conformation normally observed. As a result of these changes, the N9 methyl probes conformational space in the active site not normally occupied by antifolate structures. The N9 methyl of conformer 2-2 makes close contacts to the conserved Leu25 as well as the hydroxyl O atoms of the nicotinamide ribose and Ser64, whereas the other three reversed-bridge conformers make weak hydrophobic contacts with Ile123, Thr61 and Ile65. These antifolates are ten times more selective for pcDHFR than the C9ÐN10 bridge parent trimetrexate. However, pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines (2) and (3) are three times more selective for pcDHFR than quinazoline (1) is for rat liver DHFR. These data suggest that the loss of hydrogen-bonding interactions with N8 is more important to potency than the interactions of the methoxybenzyl substituents.

AIDS (Mills & Masur, 1990). Antifolates have been shown to be effective against dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from the pc and tg pathogens and are therefore of interest as targets for drug-design studies. Recently, trimetrexate (TMQ; Fig. 1) has been approved for treatment of pc infections (Masur et al., 1993). Biological data for a series of quinazolines revealed that the removal of the 5-methyl substituent enhanced their inhibitory potency against human DHFR (Gangjee et al., 1998). Further modi®cation of this series to include a N9ÐC10 reversed bridge and a variable benzyl methoxy-substitution pattern showed that these analogs had even greater potency against pcDHFR and tgDHFR (Gangjee et al., 1998). These results are in contrast to data for a similar series of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines with N9 methylation that showed decreased inhibitory potency against tgDHFR (Gangjee et al., 1996). Furthermore, those quinazoline analogs with a 2H ,5H - or 3H ,5H -dimethoxy-substituted benzyl ring were more potent for fungal DHFR than those with 3H ,4H ,5H -trimethyoxy substitutions (Fig. 1; Gangjee et al., 1996). As illustrated (Fig. 1), the 2H ,5H -dimethoxyquinazoline (1) is three times less selective for pcDHFR than either the 3H ,5H - or 2H ,5H -dimethoxypyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines (2) and (3). This selectivity pattern differs for tgDHFR in that (3) is ten times more selective for tgDHFR than the corresponding quinazoline (1). One rationale for the synthesis of 5-desmethyl analogs was to decrease their inhibitory potency for mammalian DHFR and to increase their selectivity for the pathogenic enzymes. Sequence alignment of the DHFR from human (hDHFR), pc and tg indicate that there are several highly conserved residues among them and that the active-site regions are homologous (Roos, 1993). The most signi®cant difference among these three enzymes is that the acidic active-site residue 32 (pc numbering) is Glu in hDHFR and pcDHFR, but is Asp in tgDHFR (Table 1). Although the hydrophobic character at positions 33 and 65 is conserved, there are residue changes. One of the more dramatic changes involves position 37 (Gln, Lys, Ser). Structural data reveal that there is sub-

domain movement of the loop involving residue 37 toward the conserved Arg75 when the inhibitor does not contain a p-aminobenzylglutamate moiety. The strength of the hydrogen-bonding interactions between residue 37 and the conserved Arg75 would be affected by the residue changes among these DHFR enzymes that could affect the selectivity of enzyme inhibition. To understand this pattern of potency and selectivity for pcDHFR and tgDHFR, crystallographic results are reported for two inhibitor±NADP+ cofactor ternary complexes with pcDHFR and the 2H ,5H -dimethoxy N9-methyl quinazoline

2. Experimental
2.1. Crystallization and X-ray data collection

Recombinant pcDHFR was isolated and puri®ed as previously described (Broughton & Queener, 1991). The protein was washed in a Centricon-10 three times with 50 mM MES buffer at pH 6.0 in 100 mM KCl buffer and concentrated to 8.6 mg mlÀ1 for (1) and 12.8 mg mlÀ1 for (2). A novel thermal gradient technique (Luft et al., 1999a,b) was used to carry out crystallization screens with pcDHFR. Crystallization of the pcDHFR±(1) complex was carried out by adding 2.5 ml of protein, 1.5 ml of MES±KCl buffer and 7 ml of 50%(w/v) PEG 2000 in 50 mM MES pH 6.0, 100 mM KCl for (1) and adding 10 ml of protein, 5 ml of MES±KCl buffer and 5 ml of 50%(w/v) PEG 2000 in 50 mM MES pH 6.0, 100 mM KCl for (2). These solutions were placed in microcentrifuge tubes for equilibration on a thermal gradient apparatus. Samples of pcDHFR were also incubated with NADP+ along with (1) or (2) and incubated overnight at 277 K. Data collection was carried out at room temperature on the best crystals available using a Rigaku R-AXIS IV imaging-plate system with a rotating-anode source and processed using DENZO (Otwinoski & Minor, 1997). Crystal lattice properties and data-collection statistics are listed in Table 2.
2.2. Structure determination and refinement

The structures of the pcDHFR± NADP+±(1) and pcDHFR±NADP+±(2) complexes were solved by molecularreplacement methods with the restrained least-squares program PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980; Finzel, 1987) in combination with the modelFigure 2 building program CHAIN (Sack, 1988).

and (2) were generated from the crystal structure of (3) (Gangjee et al., 1998) and optimized with SYBYL (Tripos Inc., 1997). The aromatic rings of the inhibitors and NADP+ were constrained to be planar. Between least-squares minimizations, the structure was manually adjusted to ®t difference electron density and veri®ed by a series of OMIT maps calculated from the current model with deleted fragments. The ®nal re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 2. The Ramachandran conformational parameters from the last cycle of re®nement generated by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) show that between 88 and 83% of the residues have the most favored conformation and none are in disallowed regions for complexes (1) and (2), respectively.

3. Results
3.1. Overall structure

The overall characteristics of these pcDHFR complexes are similar to those reported previously (Cody et al., 1993, 1997, 1999; Champness et al., 1994), in particular the folate± NADP+±pcDHFR ternary complex (Fig. 3). These data have similar conformations near the ¯exible loops 23 and 47 as the folate complex (Cody et al., 1999). There is a slight shift in the position of the C helix (residues 60±65) compared with that observed for the other pcDHFR complexes (maximum of Ê 0.8 A) between the  carbon of Ile65 of complexes for pcDHFR±NADP+±(1) and pcDHFR±NADP+±(2). These data also provide the ®rst structural observation of an N9ÐC10 reversed-bridge antifolate bound to pcDHFR. Structural details for a hybrid molecule, containing key features of the lipophilic antifolates TMQ, were previously

reported for the 2H ,5H -dimethoxy analog (3) and NADPH with hDHFR (Gangjee et al., 1998). The binding orientation of the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine or quinazoline ring in these pcDHFR complexes is similar to those observed in other pcDHFR complexes (Cody et al., 1993, 1997, 1999; Champness et al., 1994). The overall pattern of intermolecular contacts is shown in Table 3.

The carboxylate O atoms of Glu32 in both inhibitor complexes interact with the diamino ring system and forms contacts with the N1 N atom by OE2 and OE1 to the 2-amino group (Table 3). In addition, the carboxylate OE1 of Glu32 forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of the conserved Thr144, which in turn interacts with a conserved water molecule reported in most DHFR structures (Cody et al., 1993, 1997, 1999; Champness et al., 1994). In the case of the complex with (2), this water was not observed in the electron-density map. Similarly, there is an interaction of the Glu32 OE2 with a conserved water that in turn forms contacts with the conserved Trp27 and to the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine N8 of (2). Another difference between the interactions of the pcDHFR complexes of (1) and (2) is that no water was observed in the channel that interacts with the conserved Arg75, as was observed in pcDHFR±(1) and pcDHFR±MTX (Cody et al., 1999) complexes. There is also a change in the conformation of Lys73 and Thr40 in these complexes, which form hydrogen bonds to Arg75 that are not present in the pcDHFR±MTX complex (Table 3). Comparison of the pcDHFR complexes with inhibitors (1) and (2) reveals the ®rst observation of an unusual conformation of the N9ÐC10 reversed bridge (Table 4). The conformation of inhibitor (1) differs from that previously reported for the hDHFR complex with inhibitor (3) (Gangjee et al.,

1998) and from TMQ, which has a normal C9--N10 bridge (Cody et al., 1993). The data for the structure of the pcDHFR complex with (2) indicate that two alternate conformers are present in equal populations, as the electron density for the inhibitor is consistent with the presence of two models that result from inversion of the geometry at N9 (Fig. 4). Both conformers of (2) (2-1 and 2-2) differ from either the pcDHFR­(1) or hDHFR­(3) complexes (Table 4). The most significant change among these four reverse-bridged examples is observed for the C5--C6--N9--C10 torsion angle in the second conformer 2-2 of the 30 ,50 -dimethoxy TMQ analog (2) which places the N9--C10 bridge perpendicular to the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine plane. The sum of these permutations in the bridge conformation of (2) results in the dimethoxybenzyl ring occupying the same conformational space within the active site (Fig. 5). These data show that the 50 -methoxy group of all four reversed-bridge analogs makes close contacts to Phe69 and Leu72 in the pcDHFR structures, and to Leu67 and Gln35 in the human structure (Fig. 6). The contacts are shorter in the hDHFR complex. On the other hand, the 20 -methoxy group makes weaker contacts to Leu25 and Ser65 in pcDHFR and only to Leu22 in hDHFR. In the complex with (2), the 30 -methoxy makes intermolecular contacts with Leu25, Ile33 and Pro66. The N9 methyl of these reversed-bridge antifolates probes different regions of the active site as a consequence of changes in the bridge geometry. For example (Fig. 6), in inhibitors (1) and (3) the N9 methyl makes contact with residues Thr61, Ile65 and the nicotinamide ring, whereas that in the alternate conformer 2-1 makes close contacts to Thr61, while maintaining similar contacts to Ile65, Ile123 and the nicotinamide ring. On the other hand, that in conformer 2-2 makes close contacts with Leu25, as well as the hydroxyl groups of the nicotinamide ribose and Ser64.

bonds with conserved residues Ala12 and Ile19 in pcDHFR (Table 5). These contacts for (1) and (2) are stronger than those observed in the MTX­pcDHFR ternary complex (Cody et al., 1999). The conserved cis-peptide linkage between the invariant Gly124 and Gly125 permits interaction with the pyrophosphate O atoms that are positioned at the end of the

Although the cofactor NADP+ is bound in an extended conformation similar to other pcDHFR­cofactor complexes (Cody et al., 1997, 1999; Champness et al., 1994) (Table 5), there is variation in the conformation of the nicotinamide-ribose and pyrophosphate moieties (i.e. n and n; Table 6). The conformation of the nicotinamide-ribose group in these complexes more closely resembles that observed in the MTX ternary pcDHFR complex than the folate pcDHFR complex. However, the pyrophosphate-bridge conformation shows greater variation in these complexes than either the MTX or FA complexes (Cody et al., 1999).

central helix C. The largest changes in the NADP+ conformation also occur at this position (Table 6). The nicotinamide-ribose hydroxyl O1 interacts with a water molecule in (1) that is not observed in the structures of (2) or MTX (Cody et al., 1999) (Table 6). O1 also makes a close contact in (2) with the hydroxyl of Ser64 that is not observed in (1) or MTX, indicating a change in the conformation of Ser64 in this structure. The pyrophosphate O atoms make a series of close contacts with the backbone N atoms of Gln127, Thr61 and Gly125 that are conserved in all structures (Table 6). The most notable differences in the NADP+ contacts in these complexes are those involving the 3H -phosphate. Also, as indicated (Table 5), the overall conformation of NADP+ is more extended in complex with (2) than observed for the MTX±pcDHFR ternary complex (Cody et al., 1999).

4. Discussion

This is the ®rst observation of an unusual N9ÐC10 reversedbridge conformation for the 3H ,5H -dimethoxy TMQ analog (2) in the pcDHFR ternary complex. This novel conformation is a result of inversion at the N9 position. The ¯exibility in the bridge conformation places the 5H -methoxy group deep within the hydrophobic pocket made by Ile65, Pro66 and Phe69 of the pcDHFR active site. In the human enzyme, these residues are Ile60, Pro61 and Asn64, thereby changing the nature of the intermolecular contacts. The 3H -methoxy group makes less favorable contacts than the 5H -methoxy with the active-site surface and interacts with Leu25, Ile33 and Pro66. In the human structure, these residues are Leu22, Gly31 and Pro61. The mutation of Phe31 to Gly in the F31G-hDHFR±NADPH± (3) ternary complex provides a greater conformational space for the 2H ,5H -dimethoxybenzyl ring compared with the pcDHFR complexes. The overall effect of the N9ÐC10 reversed-bridge geometry is to distort the bridge from coplanarity with the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine or quinazoline ring system and to twist the C10 methylene conformation towards a gauche conformation. This change also in¯uences the conformation of the methoxybenzyl ring, moving it away from a trans position. When the two alternate conformers of inhibitor (2) are compared (Fig. 4), it is seen that the changes in bridge conformation take place in a concerted manner that places the 3H ,5H -methoxy groups in the same conforFigure 5 mational space. The 5H -methyl of inhibitors Stereoview showing the overlap of the four examples of N9ÐC10 reversed-bridge antifolates (1) and (2) makes a van der Waals contact (1) (magenta), (2) (green and yellow) and (3) (cyan).

In hDHFR, there are two sequence changes at these interaction sites, Asn64 and Phe31. Since the hDHFR complex is with a Gly31 mutant, there are no contacts made to the 2H -methoxy group of (3). These data support the hypothesis that the N9ÐC10 reversed-bridge analogs of TMQ have decreased potency and increased selectivity for pcDHFR, with the greatest pc selectivity shown for the 3H ,5H dimethoxy TMQ analog (2) (Fig. 1), which is a result of optimal placement of the methoxy groups in the hydrophobic pocket of the active site. In the case of pcDHFR, these contacts are more favorable because of the Phe69 substitution compared with Figure 6 Stereoview of the four examples of N9ÐC10 reversed-bridge antifolates (1) (magenta), (2) the Asn64 in the hDHFR sequence.
