INTRODUCTION The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) comprise a family of DNA direct repeats present in many prokaryotic genomes.1­4 The repeats are composed of 24­47 bp exhibiting weak dyad symmetry, and are separated by 26­72 bp nonrepetitive sequences. The CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins are encoded in the vicinity of the CRISPRs.2,3,5,6 The CRISPR systems (CRISPRs and Cas proteins) are classified into several subtypes, and each subtype contains several different subtype specific cas genes.6 Of the 45 Cas protein families, the amino acid sequences of several families are similar to those of nucleases, helicases, RNAand DNA-binding proteins, or transcription factors.2,6­9 Based on the properties of Cas proteins, the CRISPR systems have been hypothesized to be DNA repair ones8 or prokaryotic host defense ones against invading foreign replicons.9­12 Interestingly, it has experimentally been shown that CRISPR systems are involved in resistance against phages.13­15 Recently, it was shown that one of the Cas proteins, Cas2, comprises a novel family of endoribonucleases, and cleaves single-stranded RNAs preferentially within U-rich regions.16 However, the biochemical and structural properties of most other Cas proteins remain to be elucidated. An extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8,17 has `Ecoli subtype'- and `Mtube subtype'like CRISPR systems6 on megaplasmid pTT27, and expression of the cas genes is positively regulated by cyclic AMP

receptor protein, one of the global transcriptional regulators distributed in many bacteria.18 It has been shown that the three-dimensional structure of T. thermophilus Cse3 (TTHB192), which is one of the nine components of the `Ecoli subtype'-like CRISPR system, has an RNA recognition motif-like domain.19 In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the T. thermophilus Cse2 (TTHB189) protein, another one of the components of the `Ecoli subtype'-like CRISPR systems, with a novel fold.

METHODS
Cloning, expression, and purification

The open reading frame of T. thermophilus Cse2 was cloned into the pET-11a expression vector (NdeI-BamHI sites) (Novagen). A selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced in the E. coli methionine auxotroph Rosetta834(DE3) strain, which we obtained by introducing the pRARE plasmid (Novagen) into the B834(DE3) strain (Novagen). The cell lysate was heated at 708C for 13 min. Then the soluble fraction was applied to a Resource PHE column (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1.5M

(NH4)2SO4, which was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.2­0M (NH4)2SO4. The fractions containing the Cse2 protein were collected and applied to a Resource S column (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) equilibrated with 20 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.15M NaCl, which was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15­0.4M NaCl. The fractions containing the Cse2 protein were collected and applied to a hydroxyapatite CHT10-I column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), which was eluted with a linear gradient of 10­500 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The fractions containing the Cse2 protein were collected and applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5M NaCl. The purified protein was concentrated to 7.9 mg/ mL using a Vivaspin 20 concentrator (5000 molcularweight cutoff, Sartorius), and dithiothreitol was added to the sample to a final concentration of 1 mM. The molecular mass of the purified protein estimated on gel filtration column chromatography was 13.7 kDa, suggesting that it exists as a monomer in solution, although this value is smaller compared with that (19.4 kDa) calculated from the amino acid sequence. The molecular masses of many T. thermophilus-derived proteins estimated on gel filtration column chromatography are smaller than the calculated ones (data not shown).

Crystallization of the Cse2 protein was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 lL of a protein solution with an equal volume of a reservoir solution comprising 0.1M sodium cacodylate (pH 5.9), 30% (v/v) PEG 600, 5% (v/v) PEG 1000, and 10% (v/v) glycerol at 208C.

Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data were collected at the RIKEN Structural Genomics Beamline I (BL26B1) at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) utilizing the anomalous scat° tering from Se atoms. The data set was collected at 1.8 A resolution using a Jupiter 210 CCD detector (Rigaku MSC). The collected data were processed with the HKL2000 program suite.20 The positions of two Se atoms out of four possible sites in the asymmetric unit of the crystal were determined with program SOLVE,21 and then density modification was performed with program RESOLVE.22 The automatic tracing procedure in program ARP/wARP23 was utilized to build the initial model. The model refinement, initial picking, and manual verifying of water molecules were carried out using programs CNS and XtalView/Xfit.24,25 The electron densities corresponding to ions and multiple conformers were not identified.

The three-dimensional crystal structure of T. thermo° philus Cse2 was determined at a resolution of 1.8 A, with crystallographic Rwork and Rfree factors of 20.9% and 23.6%, respectively (Table I). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contained two monomers of Cse2 (designated as chains A and B), which are similar, as shown by the ° r.m.s.d. value of 0.45 A for corresponding main chain atoms. There are disordered regions, i.e., residues 157­ 169 in chain A and residues 160­169 in chain B, which are not included in the model. The overall structure of Cse2 (chain B) is shown in Figure 1(B). The structure consists of nine a-helices: a1, residues 3­15; a2, residues 20­30; a3, residues 39­49; a4, residues 56­71; a5, residues 82­90; a6, residues 95­105; a7, residues 111­121; a8, residues 128­136; and a9, residues 144­154. Three main hydrophobic cores are present in the structure. One is composed of A83, L86, and A90 in a5; V96, F100, L103, and L104 in a6; W138 between a8 and a9; and V145, W149, and Y153 in a9. Another one is composed of A61, L64, V65, and L68 in a4; L82 in a5; L115 and V119 in a7; I126 in the loop between a7 and a8; and F128, L131, and L135 in a8. The third one is composed of F7, W10, L11 in a1; W20, A23, and F27 in a2; V45, F48, and L49 in a3; and H62, Y63, A66, and A70 in a4. The T. thermophilus Cse2 structure was compared with previously determined structures in the PDB database, using the Secondary structure matching (SSM) server.31 As a result, only a few proteins exhibiting matches with lower similarity were found, i.e, the closest structure was that of TetR-family regulator (SCO0857) from Streptomy° ces coelicolor, the r.m.s.d. value being 3.19 A, and the Q-, P-, and Z-scores being 0.12, 0.0, and 1.6, which means that the matches are insignificant. This indicates that T. thermophilus Cse2 adopts a novel fold [Fig. 1(B,E)]. A conserved concavity is present on the surface [Fig. 1(C,D)]. T. thermophilus Cse2 has a high theoretical isoelectric point of 9.6, and it has large continuous basic patches on one side of its surface, which are highly conserved in the seven closest homologs to the Cse2 [Fig. 1(C,D)]. This structural feature is also observed in T. thermophilus Cse3, which is another of the nine components of the `Ecoli subtype'-like CRISPR system, although its overall structure differs from that of the Cse2.19 The cas gene products including T. thermophilus Cse3 have been suggested to be involved in DNA/RNA metabolism.2,6­9,15,19 The Cse2 might interact with nucleic acids at its basic patches.
