Department of Biology, University (~['Rochester, Rochester, N Y 14627, USA Received 22 May 1995 formed to determine the role of this Cys showed that its substitution by other amino acids resulted in a complete loss of function by the MTases, M.EcoRII, M.HhaI, M.HaelII, M . D c m [ 10-13]. Furthermore, introduction of 5-fluorocytosine in the D N A target resulted in the formation of trapped intermediates [13-15]. The covalent bond between Cys and C6 of Cyt was clearly visible in the M . H h a I - D N A structure, where 5fluorocytosine-containing D N A was used to make the co-crystal [16]. F r o m the 3D structure of M.Hhal, it has been suggested that the motif IV Pro makes a hydrophobic contact with substrate A d o M e t [16,17]. These data prompted us to use the technique of site-directed mutagenesis to study the role of the Pro-185 residue in the EcoRII MTase motif IV.

Abstract ProCys in the conserved sequence motif IV of [cytosine-C5]-DNA methyltransferases is known to be part of the catalytic site. The Cys residue is directly involved in forming a covalent bond with the C6 of the target cytosine. We have found that substitution of Pro-185 with either Ala or Ser resulted in a reduced rate of methyl group transfer by the E c o R I I DNA methyltransferase. In addition, we observed an increase in the Km for substrate S-adenosyI-L-methionine (AdoMet), but a decrease in the Kn, for substrate DNA. This is reflected in minor changes in kc,,tIK m for DNA, but in 10- to 100-fold reductions in k c a t l K m for AdoMet. This suggests that Pro-185 is important to properly orient the activated cytosine and AdoMet for methyl group transfer by direct interaction with AdoMet and indirectly via the Cys interaction with cytosine.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and resins [methyl-3H]AdoMet (73 Ci/mmol and 15 Ci/mmol) was from New England Nuclear. Unlabeled AdoMet (90% pure; from Sigma) was purified by HPLC on a C18-reversed-phase column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, fitted with a 4.5 cm x 4.6 mm guard C 18-column) using isocratic elution in 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, with 5% methanol. The AdoMet was dried in vacuo, dissolved in 5 mM HC1, 5% ethanol and stored at -20°C (or at 4°C if it was used within one week). The final preparation was 99.6% pure. The concentration of AdoMet was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient at 256 nm of 14,700 (in acid) [18]. Phosphocellulose and DE81 ion-exchange filter paper were purchased from Whatman. Hydroxyapatite and heparin agarose were from BioRad. 2.2. Cloning. mutagenesis and sequencing The EcoRII MTase gene was amplified using linearized plasmid pVK33 [19] as a template with primers containing BgllI site according to the PCR protocol of Perkin Elmer-Cetus. The PCR-generated EcoRII MTase gene containing fragment was cloned into BgllI site of vector pGC2 [20]. The new plasmid, designated pGC2RIIM, was then mutagenized to obtain mutants at Pro-185. Mutagenesis was performed by a slight modification of the method of Kunkel et al. [21]; viz. Sequenase 2.0 (US Biochemical) replaced Escherichia coli Pollk and only one primer was used. The EcoRIl MTase gene was excised on a NdelBamHI fragment and cloned into the vector, pJW2 [22]. DNA sequence analysis was by the method of Sanger et al. [23]. 2.3. Bacterial growth E. coli B834 [24] cells containing an appropriate plasmid were grown in ampicillin-containing LB broth [25] at 30°C to an OD600 = 0.8 1.0. The temperature was raised to 42°C and incubation continued an additional 3 h. The cells were collected by low-speed centrifugation and stored frozen at -20°C. 2.4. Purification of wt and mutant EcoRII-MTases Frozen cells were thawed and suspended in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (-= PEM buffer), containing 0.4 M NaCI, 0.1% NP40, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. Cells were disrupted by sonication and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h. The supernatant was diluted two-fold in PEM buffer and applied to a phosphocellulose column. Fractions containing MTase activity were pooled and purified on an hydroxyapatite column. Active

1. Introduction
D N A methyltransferases (MTases) recognize specific nucleic acid sequences and transfer the methyl group from A d o M e t to adenine or cytosine residues within these sequences. MTases that are components of bacterial restriction-modification systems protect the cellular D N A against degradation by methylation of the sequence recognized by the cognate restriction enzyme. There are three major classes of MTases, which differ in the resulting modification product: viz. N6-methyladenine (m6A), N4-methylcytosine (mac) or C~-methylcytosine (mSC). The deduced amino acid (aa) sequences have been determined for more than 90 cloned MTase genes [1]. Comparison of the sequences has revealed a remarkable similarity among the m5C MTases [2-4], which are readily distinguishable from the other two classes of MTases. The latter groups, however, also share similarities with each other, but these are not as pronounced as those found among the mSC MTases [5-8]. The maC and N6A MTases methylate an exocyclic amino nitrogen, whereas mSC MTases methylate a ring carbon. Thus, the two groups use distinct reaction mechanisms, which most probably contribute to their structural differences. O f the ten conserved motifs observed in mSC MTases, m o t i f IV [PxxxGxPCQxxSxxG], containing ProCys, is thought to be part of the catalytic site [9]. The Cys contains a nucleophilic thiol that interacts with Cyt in the recognition sequence. Mutagenesis studies per*Corresponding author. Fax: (1) (716) 275-2070.

76 fractions were dialysed against PEM buffer with 0.1 M NaCI and purified further by chromatography on heparin agarose. 2.5. Steady state kinetic determinations Apparent Km(DNA), Km(AdoMet) and kcat values were determined by monitoring [3H]CH3 transfer from labeled AdoMet to unmethylated substrate DNA (phage 2,- dcm- dam-). Reaction mixtures (50/A) contained 100 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 200/tg/ml of bovine serum albumin and variable concentrations of enzyme, DNA or AdoMet (see Table 2). Under the conditions employed, methyl transfer was linear for at least 30 rain. After incubation at 37°C for 10 min, 40 gl was removed and spotted onto DE81 filters. These were then washed three times with 50 mM KH2PO4, twice with 80% ethanol, once with 95% ethanol, dried and the radioactivity counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The number of methyl groups transferred to the DNA was calculated from the radioactivity bound to the filter [minus that in the zero time aliquot] divided by the specific activity. Kinetic parameters were obtained using the Enzyme Kinetics program from Trinity Software. 2.6. Other analytical procedures SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according Laemmli [26]. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford [27] with bovine serum albumin as the standard. 3. Results 3.1. Production o f aa replacements at Pro-185 in motif I V We used oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of the EcoRII MTase gene to change Pro-185 located in the ProCys of motif IV [3]. Following D N A sequence analysis, an NdeIEcoRI fragment containing the mutation was subcloned into the corresponding sites of plasmid pJW2 [22]. The standard MTase assay (see section 2) was then used to determine enzyme activity in crude extracts containing either the wt or mutant enzymic form. The results summarized in Table 1 show that each of the eight Pro-185 substitutions resulted in a sharp reduction of MTase activity. It should be noted that these assays were performed in 1.0 BM AdoMet, which corresponds to a concentration 3-fold higher than the Km for wt MTase. As observed later, hoverever, two m u t a n t forms taken for further analysis exhibited increased/<ms for AdoMet. Hence, the activities shown in Table 1 are lower limits for those two mutants, and possibly others as well. Two of the replacements, P185A and P185S, were studied further. The wt and m u t a n t EeoRIIMTases were overproduced and purified, as described in section 2. The protein was about 55 kDa (data not shown), consistent with the size predicted from the EcoRII MTase open reading frame [28]. 3.2. Steady state kinetic analysis Table 2 summarizes the results of steady state kinetic analyses. The kcat and the apparent KmS for AdoMet and D N A were derived from initial velocity experiments by varying AdoMet and D N A concentrations. We observed that the /<ca, was 2- to

Cell extracts were prepared as described in section 2. Standard asssay reaction mixtures (50/11) contained 100 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 200 /~g/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 /lg/ml 2.dam-dem- DNA, 1.0 /IM AdoMet and different dilutions of cell extracts.

8-fold reduced, the Km for AdoMet was 5- to 13-fold increased, whereas the Km for D N A was 2- to 4-fold reduced in the mutants compared to the wt. This is reflected in minor changes in koat/Km for D N A , whereas 10- to 100-fold reductions in kcat/Km for AdoMet were observed. 4. Discussion In our study with the EcoRII-MTase, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to produce amino acid substitutions of Pro-185 in the motif IV ProCys. Two m u t a n t proteins, P185A and P185S, were overexpressed and purified. They were different from the wt enzyme with respect to kCa, and Km for substrates D N A and AdoMet (Table 2). Interestingly, these substitutions resulted in 2- to 4-fold decrease in Km for DNA, and 5- to 13-fold increases in Km for AdoMet. The ProCys dipeptide plays a crucial role in catalysis by stabilizing a transient ternary complex through interaction with AdoMet and the D N A Cyt to be methylated. The formation of the ternary complex precedes the activation of Cyt, when methyl group transfer occurs. All these steps depend on the establishment of stereo-specific coupling between AdoMet, Cyt and the ProCys dipeptide. Our results indicate that Pro-185 mutations affect the interactions of EcoRII MTase with both substrates. Substitutions at Pro185 could stabilize or destabilize the transition steps of the DNA:enzyme:AdoMet intermediate, which results in a decreased rate of catalysis. However, some capacity to coordinate the two substrate sites in the methyl transfer reaction is still retained. Because of its unique properties, Pro is regarded as a key residue in protein folding. It has less conformational freedom than any other aa residue, especially in unfolded structures (such as the one in which motif IV is located), since the Pro side chain is fixed by a covalent bond to the backbone. Therefore, we propose that the main role of the Pro-185 is to
