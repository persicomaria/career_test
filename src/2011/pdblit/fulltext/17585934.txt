In the bacterium Bacillus sp. GL1, gellan is depolymerized to give a tetrasaccharide by extracellular gellan lyase and then the tetrasaccharide is converted to constituent monosaccharides by intracellular glycosidases. Two genes encoding one of the glycosidases, -D-glucosidase (Bgl), were cloned in a genomic DNA library of the bacterium constructed in Escherichia coli and nucleotide sequences of the genes were determined. One of the genes, termed bglA, contained an open reading frame (ORF) consisting of 1344 base pairs coding a polypeptide (BglA) with a molecular mass of 51 kDa and the other, termed bglB, 2268 base pairs coding a protein (BglB) with a molecular mass of 82 kDa. By homology analyses of the ORFs against protein sequence databases, -Dglucosidase A (BglA) and -D-glucosidase B (BglB) were found to be classified into subfamilies BGA and BGB of cellulase family BG, respectively. BglA and BglB purified from E. coli were monomeric enzymes with molecular masses of 50 and 82 kDa and most active at pH 6.0 and 8.0, respectively. BglA showed broader substrate specificity than BglB. Only BglA acted on the tetrasaccharide produced from gellan by gellan lyase and released glucose from the molecule. © 1998 Academic Press

Gellan is an exopolysaccharide produced by Sphingomonas paucimobilis (1) originally designated Auromonas (Pseudomonas) elodea. The polysaccharide consists of a linear repeating tetrasaccharide [3 3)- 3 D-Glc p-(1 3 4)- -D-GlcAp-(1 3 4)- -D-Glcp-(1 3 4)- L-Rhap-(1 3] (2), and polysaccharides having the repeating unit with various branching sugars form the gellan family. The composition and location of branching chains determine the rheological properties of the polysaccharides. Deacetylated gellan (gellan gum) has been commercialized for potential food applications (3). However, the high viscosity of gellan has largely limited the utility of the polymer in the food industry and methods are now sought to prepare low-viscosity gellan for food and other biopolymer-based industries. Two methods for polysaccharide depolymerization have been attempted. These are chemical and enzymatic methods. Although the former method has been developed to prepare low-viscosity welan (4), the latter method has not been exploited because of the lack in suitable enzymes. Previously, we have isolated a bacterium, Bacillus sp. GL1, depolymerizing gellan and characterized the enzymatic route for gellan depolymerization in the bacterium (5, 6). Bacillus sp. GL1 first converted gellan to a tetrasaccharide (4,5-ene-glucuronyl-glucosyl-rhamnosyl-glucose] by the extracellular gellan lyase and then degraded the tetrasaccharide into constituent monosaccharides by intracellular exoglycosidases such as -D-glucosidase (Bgl) and -L-rhamnosidase (Fig. 1). We have already cloned gellan

lyase gene and showed the unusual maturation process of the enzyme in the bacterium (7). Subsequent to this study on the degradation of gellan in Bacillus sp. GL1, we have attempted to clone one of exoglycosidase genes, the -D-glucosidase gene, involved in gellan degradation to analyze the primary structure of the gene and to characterize the enzyme.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. Gellan (molecular mass 5 105, deacetylated), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl- -D-glucopyranoside (X-Glc), salicine, and the Glucose CII test for the assay of glucose were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals Co. (Osaka, Japan). Silica gel 60/Kieselguhr F254 thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates were obtained from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). p-Nitrophenyl (pNP)-glycosides and gentiobiose were purchased from Nacalai Tesque Co. (Kyoto, Japan). Butyl-Toyopearl 650M and DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B were from Tosoh Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and Pharmacia Biotechnology Co. (Uppsala, Sweden), respectively. Cello-oligosaccharides, laminaribiose, and sophorose were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Restriction endonucleases, DNA-modifying enzymes, and Escherichia coli DH5 -competent cells were from Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto, Japan) and Toyobo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). A cloning vector of Charomid 9-36 and an In Vitro Packaging Kit Lambda Inn were from Nippon Gene Co. (Tokyo, Japan). A plasmid of pBluescript II SK was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

Microorganisms and culture conditions. For screening of the -Dglucosidase producer, E. coli DH5 cells with the genomic DNA library of Bacillus sp. GL1 constructed as described (7) were grown at 37°C on LB (8) plates supplemented with 100 g/ml ampicillin and 0.1 mg/ml X-Glc. DNA sequence and DNA manipulations. DNA sequences of -Dglucosidase genes were determined by the dideoxy-chain termination method using an automated DNA sequencer (Model 377; Applied Biosystems Division of Perkin­Elmer, Foster City, CA) (9). Subcloning, transformation, and gel electrophoresis were performed as described previously (10). Preparation of gellan-depolymerization product. The gellan-depolymerization product, trisaccharide [ -D-Glcp-(1 3 4)- -L-Rhap(1 3 3)- -D-Glcp], as a substrate for -D-glucosidase was prepared as described previously (6). Thin-layer chromatography. Degradation of the gellan-depolymerization product was analyzed by TLC with a solvent system of 1-butanol:acetic acid:water (3:2:2, v/v). The product was visualized by heating the plate at 110°C for 5 min after spraying with 10% (v/v) sulfuric acid in ethanol. -D-GlucosiAssay for enzyme activity and protein concentration. dase was assayed using p-nitrophenyl- -D-glucopyranoside as a substrate (5). Activity of -D-glucosidase toward natural sugars such as cellobiose and sophorose was determined by the assay of released glucose using glucose oxidase (Glucose CII test, Wako). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (11), with bovine serum albumin as a standard.

Electrophoresis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE) and native gradient PAGE were performed as described previously (12, 13). Purification of -D-glucosidases. Unless otherwise specified, all operations were done at 0 to 4°C. Two kinds of E. coli cells transformed with -D-glucosidase A (bglA) and -D-glucosidase B (bglB) genes were cultured for 24 h at 28°C in 15 liters of LB medium with 50 g/ml ampicillin and were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000g at 4°C for 10 min. Collected cells (each wet weight, 84 g) were washed in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (KPB), pH 7.0, resuspended in the same buffer, and then ultrasonically disrupted (Insonator, Model 201M; Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) at 0°C, 9 kHz for 1 h. Clear solutions obtained after centrifugation at 15,000g at 4°C for 20 min were dialyzed against 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0, overnight, and the dialysates were used as cell extracts. Each cell extract was fractionated with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate (BglA, 50 ­70% saturation; BglB, 30 ­50% saturation) was collected by centrifugation at 15,000g at 4°C for 20 min. Each precipitate was dissolved in about 200 ml of 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0, and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (4.2 38 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0. Each enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0 ­1 M) in 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0 (2 liters), and 16-ml fractions were collected every 10 min. Active fractions of BglA and BglB, which were eluted with 0.43 M NaCl (BglA) and 0.38 M NaCl (BglB), were 30 and 25% saturated with ammonium sulfate, respectively. BglA solution (57 ml) was applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (2.7 9 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0, saturated with ammonium sulfate (30%). BglA was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (30 ­ 0%) in 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0 (500 ml). Four-milliliter fractions were collected every 4 min. The active fractions (BglA), which were eluted with 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0, saturated with ammonium sulfate (20%), were combined and used as the purified enzyme (BglA). BglB solution (64 ml) saturated with ammonium sulfate (25%) was applied to a ButylToyopearl 650M column (2.7 9 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0, saturated with ammonium sulfate (25%). BglB was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (25­ 0%) in 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0 (400 ml). Three-milliliter fractions were collected every 2 min. The active fractions (BglB), which were eluted with 20 mM KPB, pH 7.0, saturated with ammonium sulfate (10%), were combined and used as the purified enzyme (BglB). N-terminal amino acid sequences of enzymes. N-terminal amino acid sequences of enzymes were determined by Edman degradation using a Procise 492 protein-sequencing system (Applied Biosystems Division of Perkin­Elmer).

subcloning of the genomic DNAs, two genes contained in 2.8-kb BamHI and 4.5-kb HindIII fragments were found to be essential for -D-glucosidase activity. The BamHI and HindIII fragments were ligated into the plasmid of pBluescript II SK and the resultant plasmids were designated pGlc1 and pGlc16, respectively. E. coli DH5 cells were transformed with pGlc1 and pGlc16, and transformants were termed Glc1 and Glc16, respectively. Sequence Analyses of -D-Glucosidase Genes The nucleotide sequence of the BamHI fragment (2869 bp) in pGlc1 and that of the HindIII fragment (4451 bp) in pGlc16 were determined (Fig. 2). The gene in pGlc1, termed bglA, contained an ORF capable of coding for a polypeptide (BglA) with a molecular mass of 51,157 (Fig. 2A). Because the fragment in pGlc16 was found to contain the HindIII­Sau3AI region of Charomid 9-36 with a molecular size of 271 bp, the inserted genomic DNA of Bacillus sp. GL1 in pGlc16 had a molecular weight of 4180 bp. The gene, termed bglB, contained an ORF capable of coding for a protein (BglB) with a molecular mass of 82,476 (Fig. 2B). Since both of the deduced amino acid sequences of BglA and BglB were found to have high identities with bacterial and/or fungal -D-glucosidases, the amino acid sequences were confirmed to represent the primary structures of -D-glucosidases. BglA, consisting of 1344 bp, began with an ATG start codon 1212 nucleotides from the BamHI site of the inserted genomic DNA and ended with a TGA stop codon 2,556 nucleotides downstream from the same BamHI site. BglB, consisting of 2268 bp, began with an ATG start codon 826 nucleotides from the Sau3AI site of the inserted genomic DNA and ended with a TAG stop codon 3094 nucleotides downstream from the same Sau3AI site. Because homologous sequences with E. coli consensus promoter (14) existed in 5 -regions upstream of both initiation codons of bglA and bglB, the transcription of bglA and bglB is suggested to be directed by the endogeneous Bacillus sp. GL1 promoter (Fig. 2). The predicted ribosome-binding sites (SD sequence, GGAGG) (15) existed just before the start codons of bglA and bglB (Fig. 2). A hairpin structure containing a stem composed of 14 nucleotides was observed downstream of the stop codon of bglA (Fig. 2A). The structure had a free energy of 14.4 kcal and may function as a transcriptional terminator in a Rho factor-independent manner. However, the apparent terminator was not found downstream of the anchor of bglB. An ORF (ORF1) was found downstream of bglB and was composed of 756 bp which began with an ATG start codon 3115 nucleotides from the Sau3AI site of the inserted genomic DNA and ended with a TAA stop codon 3871 nucleotides down-

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Molecular Cloning of -D-Glucosidase Genes The gene responsible for - D -glucosidase was screened in a genomic DNA library of Bacillus sp. GL1, which was constructed in E. coli DH5 having no -Dglucosidase activity. When E. coli cells with the genomic DNA library were grown on LB plates supplemented with X-Glc, several blue colonies appeared, indicating positive clones for -D-glucosidase. Clones were purified, confirmed to have genomic DNAs of Bacillus sp. GL1 in the cloning vector of Charomid 9-36, and, by restriction enzyme maps of the genomic DNAs, they were found to be categorized to two groups. By

containing histidinyl and glutamate residues (22, 23). The domain has been suggested to be involved in the cleavage of -glucosidic bonds. BglA was also found to have histidynyl and glutamate residues in the catalytic domain (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, BglB is thought to belong to the BGB subfamily. A highly conserved region in the BGB subfamily -D-glucosidases is known, and an aspartate residue in the region has been suggested to be a catalytic site (24). Such a conserved region with aspartate residue is also confirmed in BglB (Fig. 3B). Expression of Recombinant -D-Glucosidases in E. coli Cell extracts of Glc1 and Glc16 exhibited -D-glucosidase activity, although a transformant of E. coli DH5 with pBluescriptII SK (control) had no enzymatic activity. Cell extracts of Glc1 and Glc16 were subjected to SDS­PAGE. Increased expression of about 50- and 80kDa proteins was observed in the cell extracts of Glc1 and Glc16, respectively, in comparison with that of the control (Fig. 4A). Because molecular weights of these proteins coincided with those of BglA and BglB, respectively, both BglA and BglB were considered to be expressed intracellularly without any modifications.

Arrows indicate the conserved catalytic residues.

Homology Analyses of -D-Glucosidase Genes By using the FASTA program (16), both BglA and BglB show significant homologies with other -D-glucosidases. BglA exhibits the highest identity score with Bacillus circulans -glucosidase (60% identity in a 443-aa overlap) (17), followed by Bacillus polymyxa -glucosidase A (57%) (18). In the case of BglB, the highest scores were obtained with Erwinia chrysanthemi -D-glucosidase/xylosidase (35% in a 724-a.a. overlap) (19), followed by glucan 1,4- -glucosidase of Pseudomonas fluorescens (26%) (20). Based upon the sequence similarity, BglA and BglB were categorized to two distinct families of glucosyl hydrolases. -DGlucosidases have been reported to belong to cellulase family BG and form two subfamilies BGA and BGB (21). The BGA subfamily contains mainly bacterial -D-glucosidases with a molecular mass of about 50 kDa. On the other hand, the BGB subfamily is composed of bacterial and fungal enzymes with a molecular size of approximately 80 kDa. By sequence homology, BglA of Bacillus sp. GL1 is considered to be classified into the BGA subfamily. -D-Glucosidases belonging to the BGA subfamily form a putative catalytic domain

Purification and Properties of -D-Glucosidases BglA and BglB were purified 42.7-fold with a recovery of 17.3% and 31.3-fold with a recovery of 24.8% from cell extracts of Glc1 and Glc16, respectively (Table I). Purified enzymes were homogeneous on SDS­ PAGE (Fig. 4B). (i) Molecular mass. BglA and BglB were monomeric enzymes with molecular masses of 50 and 82 kDa as determined by SDS­PAGE (Fig. 4B) and by native gradient PAGE (data not shown). (ii) pH and temperature. BglA and BglB were most active at pH 6.0 in sodium acetate buffer and pH 8.0 in Tris­HCl buffer, respectively, and at 45 and 40°C, respectively. Both BglA and BglB were stable below at 37°C, and about 50% of both activities was lost after incubation at 40°C for 10 min. (iii) Metal ions and others. The effects of various compounds on BglA and BglB activities were investigated (Table II). Although almost all divalent metal ions, thiol, and chelate reagents had little effect on both enzyme activities, Hg2 ion seriously inhibited both activities. Furthermore, both activities were not affected by sugars, including D-Glc of the reaction product. (iv) Substrate specificity. To examine the substrate specificity of BglA and BglB, enzymes were incubated at 30°C in 50 mM KPB, pH 7.0, containing 0.4 mM p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-glycosides or 17 mM disaccharides (Table III). BglA was highly active on pNP- -D-Glc and pNP- -D-Fuc and slightly on pNP- -D-Gal. BglA also hydrolyzed laminaribiose, sophorose, and cellobiose more efficiently than pNP- -D-Glc. On the other hand, BglB was highly specific for pNP- -D-Glc and

was almost inert on various pNP-glycosides except for pNP- -D-Xyl. After prolonged reaction, both BglA and BglB degraded cellooligosaccharides (di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharides) to Glc (data not shown).

(v) N-terminal amino acid sequence. N-terminal amino acid sequences of BglA and BglB from E. coli were determined to be ASIQFPKDFV (2Ala-11Val) and MENAARQASV (1Met-10Val), respectively (Fig. 2). BglA in E. coli was suggested to be processed by methionine aminopeptidase, while BglB was expressed in E. coli without any modifications. Degradation of Gellan-Depolymerization Product by -D-Glucosidase The clarification of the involvement of BglA and/or BglB in gellan degradation was attempted. The trisaccharide [ -D-Glcp-(1 3 4)- -L-Rhap-(1 3 3)- -D-Glcp] of gellan-depolymerization product was incubated with BglA or BglB. While the mobility of the trisaccharide in the presence of BglB did not change, glucose was released from the trisaccharide by BglA (Fig. 5). Glucose and rhamnosyl glucose seemed to have the same mobility on the TLC, because the hydrolysate of the reaction products with BglA was composed of glucose and rhamnose. This result indicates that only BglA is involved in gellan depolymerization. Several bacteria have two -D-glucosidases possibly belonging to BGA and BGB subfamilies (25­28). Because substrate specificities of those enzymes including BglA and BglB have been reported to differ, BglA and BglB are thought to exist in Bacillus sp. GL1 in order to be used properly. In the case of assimilation of gellan

The trisaccharide [ -D-Glcp-(1 3 4)- -L-Rhap-(1 3 3)-D-Glcp] of the gellan-depolymerization product was incubated with BglA and BglB (each 60 mU) in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 30°C for 24 h. The reaction products were analyzed by TLC. Lane 1, no enzyme; lane 2, BglA; lane 3, BglB. Authentic samples: lane 4, D-glucose; lane 5, L-rhamnose.

in Bacillus sp. GL1, it was shown that BglA has played a major role in the degradation of gellan-depolymerization product.
