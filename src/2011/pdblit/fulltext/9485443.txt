ABSTRACT: X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a heritable immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene coding for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). Btk belongs to the Tec family of tyrosine kinases. Each member of the family contains five regions and mutations causing XLA have been isolated in all five regions. We have determined the solution structure of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Btk using two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on natural abundance and 15N-labeled protein material. The structure determination is complemented by investigation of backbone dynamics based on 15N NMR relaxation. The Btk SH3 forms a well-defined structure and shows the typical SH3 topology of two short antiparallel -sheets packed almost perpendicular to each other in a sandwich-like fold. The N- and C-termini are more flexible as are peptide fragments in the RT and n-Src loops. The studied Btk SH3 fragment adopts two slowly interconverting conformations with a relative concentration ratio of 7:1. The overall fold of the minor form is similar to that of the major form, as judged on the basis of observed NOE connectivities and small chemical shift differences. A tryptophan (W251) ring flip is the favored mechanism for interconversion, although other possibilities cannot be excluded. The side chain of Y223, which becomes autophosphorylated upon activation of Btk, is exposed within the potential SH3 ligand binding site. Finally, we compare the present Btk SH3 structure with other SH3 structures.

The immunodeficiency X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is caused by a lymphocyte differentiation block resulting in no or very low concentrations of B cells and plasma cells (1). The defective gene codes for Bruton's tyrosine kinase, Btk, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and a member of the Tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (2, 3). It appears to play an important role in the regulation of B cell proliferation and differentiation. Btk is expressed in most hematopoietic cells, but is selectively downregulated in plasma cells and T-lymphocytes (4-6). The domain organization of Btk and of other Tec family tyrosine kinases

resembles that of the Src family tyrosine kinases in that they all have a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, an SH2 domain and a C-terminal catalytic (kinase) domain. Tec family kinases lack the consensus N-terminal myristoylation site of Src family kinases but have an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (7) that might play a role in membrane translocation of the kinase (8). The PH domain is followed by a Tec homology (TH) domain/region (6, 9). XLA-causing mutations have been found in exons encoding all five subdomains (10). Among these is a point mutation in a 5 splice site, resulting in a deletion of 21 C-terminal residues in the SH3 domain, including parts of the potential ligandbinding site (11). Circular dichroism studies on a peptide corresponding to the SH3 domain part of this deletion mutant suggest that it does not alone form a folded structure (12). SH3 domains are known to interact with proline rich motifs with the consensus sequence PXXP (13, 14). All known SH3-ligands contain at least one PXXP motif. The TH domain of Btk contains two such regions, which interact with the SH3 domains of Lyn, Fyn, and Hck (15) whereas the related Tec family kinases Bmx, Itk, and Tec contain one such sequence (9, 16). It has been shown that the corresponding sequence in Itk can form an intramolecular complex with the SH3 domain and that this complex inhibits binding of the SH3 domain and the proline-rich motif to their ligands (17).

Solution Structure of the Btk SH3 Domain Recently the crystal structures of inactivated forms of c-Src and Hck tyrosine kinases were solved (18, 19). These structures reveal intramolecular interactions between the catalytic domain and both the SH2 and the SH3 domains. The linker region between the SH2 domain and the catalytic domain forms a left-handed PPII helix, which acts as a ligand for the SH3 domain. Activation of Src family kinases involves a displacement of the SH3 domain (20). A regulatory C-terminal tyrosine of Src family kinases is not present in Btk or Tec family kinases. Thus, the regulation of Btk must be partially different from that of the Src family kinases. Btk is activated by a phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine (Y551) within the catalytic domain (21). The activated Btk, which is predominantly membrane associated, is then autophosphorylated at Y223 within the SH3 domain (22). Our objective is to characterize the structure and function of Btk at a molecular level to understand the mechanism of regulation and how a defective enzyme can result in XLA. As a part of these studies we have determined the solution structure of the human Btk SH3 domain using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. The backbone conformation of Btk SH3 is compared to that of other SH3 domains, and the position of Y223 in the structure is discussed in relation to its role in Btk function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and Purification of Btk SH3. The DNA fragment encoding residues 212-275 of human Btk was amplified by PCR, and the fragment was cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Pharmacia, Sweden) for expression in Escherichia coli. The construct was transformed in the XL1-Blue strain of E. coli (23), and Btk SH3 was expressed by fermenting the cells in 2×TY medium containing 2% glucose as a catabolic repressor at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 1.8-2.0. The protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. After 3-4 h of induction the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication at 4 °C in a PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM aprotinin, 1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 18000g for 40 min. The GST-fusion product was bound to glutathioneSepharose, and digested with thrombin (50 units; Sigma Chemical Co.), and Btk SH3 was eluted with PBS buffer. The digested and eluted Btk SH3 contained three extra residues in the N-terminal, denoted G1, S2, and M3. The purification was continued using Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia, Sweden) equilibrated with phosphate buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM NaCl at pH 6.5). The protein was then eluted with a linear 0.05-0.5 M salt gradient. Fractions containing Btk SH3 were pooled and concentrated for gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia, Sweden) equilibrated with phosphate buffer. The gelfiltrated Btk SH3 was finally concentrated to 5 mg/mL, sodium azide was added to a final concentration of 0.02%, and the protein solution was stored at 4 °C. The 15N-labeled protein was expressed in M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl (0.5 g/L; Isotec Inc., OH) and ISOGRO 15N Powder-Growth Medium (1 g/L; Isotec Inc., OH) and purified as the unlabeled protein, but with an extra gel filtration.

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 9, 1998 2913 Analytical Methods. The Btk SH3 domain was identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectroscopy and N-terminal sequencing. The purity of the protein was analyzed by gel filtration high-performance liquid chromatography (GF-HPLC) using a Tosohaas TSK-GEL G3000 SWXL column (7.8 × 300 mm) equilibrated with phosphate buffer. The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method (24) with bovine gammaglobulins (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as standard. NMR Sample Preparation. The samples containing Btk SH3 were further concentrated using Amicon Ultrafiltration cells with Amicon Diaflo membranes (YM3) and Amicon Centricon 3 concentrators. Three samples were used for NMR resonance assignments and structure determination: 15 N-labeled protein in H2O/D2O (9:1), unlabeled protein in H2O/D2O (9:1) and unlabeled protein in 100% D2O. All NMR samples were prepared in 20 mM phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA at pH 6.5. Final protein concentrations were approximately 2 and 8-10 mM for 15Nlabeled and unlabeled samples, respectively. The purity of NMR samples was checked with SDS-PAGE. NMR Spectroscopy. NMR was measured using a Varian Unity 500 NMR spectrometer (at a magnetic field of 11.7 T) equipped with three rf channels, pulsed field gradients, and a 5 mm triple-resonance (1H/15N/13C) probe. Proton and 15N chemical shifts at 30 °C were referenced to H O at 4.74 2 ppm and to external [15N]benzamide at 105.4 ppm (25), respectively. Two-dimensional homonuclear experiments, DQF-COSY (26), NOESY (27), and clean-TOCSY (28), were recorded at 30 °C with the H2O/D2O (9:1) and 100% D2O samples and at 40°C with the H2O/D2O (9:1) sample. The data sets contained 512 t1 increments and 32 transients/increment for the NOESY and DQF-COSY experiments, and 512 t1 increments and 16 transients/increment for the TOCSY experiments, with 1024 acquired complex data points/ transient in all experiments. The cross-relaxation mixing times used in various NOESY experiments ranged between 60 and 200 ms. In addition, NOESY spectra with 200, 500, and 750 ms mixing times were recorded at 50 °C on a protein sample in H2O/D2O. The isotropic mixing times used in the TOCSY experiments were 50 and 70 ms. Water suppression was achieved by presaturation during relaxation and cross-relaxation delays. In one 150 ms NOESY experiment, water suppression was achieved using the flip-back WATERGATE method according to Lippens et al. (29). The data were recorded in phase-sensitive mode with the hypercomplex States-TPPI method (30). Two-dimensional and three-dimensional heteronuclear (1H and 15N) experiments, 2D HSQC (31, 32), 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 15N-edited HSQC-TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC (32) were recorded at 30 °C. The 1H and 15N transmitter frequencies were set to the resonance frequency of water and 119.6 ppm, respectively. Spectral widths were 5988 Hz in the F1 (1H) dimension, 2000 Hz in the F2 (15N) dimension (F1 for 2D HSQC), and 5999.7 Hz in the F3 (1H) dimension (F2 for 2D HSQC). The 3D spectra were acquired with 128 t1 increments, 32 t2 increments, 8 transients/increment (4 in the 3D TOCSYHSQC experiments) and 512 complex data points/transient (64 × 32 × 16 × 512 for HSQC-TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC) using sensitivity-enhanced detection (31). The cross-

2914 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 9, 1998 relaxation mixing times for NOESY-HSQC were 75 and 150 ms, and the isotropic mixing times for TOCSY-HSQC were 27.2, 52.3, and 77.2 ms. The cross relaxation and isotropic mixing times in the HSQC-TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC were 150 and 28.7 ms, respectively. Three-dimensional heteronuclear 3D HNHA with water flip-back (33) and 3D HNHB (34) with spin lock pulses and presaturation for suppression of the water signal were recorded at 30 °C. Transmitter frequencies, spectral widths, data set sizes, etc. were identical with those described above. Quadrature detection in indirectly detected dimensions was accomplished using the States-TPPI method. Longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates (R1 and R2) of backbone 15N nuclei and the {1H}15N steady-state NOE were measured using HSQC-based pulse sequences that suppress cross-correlation between 15N-1H dipolar interactions and 15N chemical shift anisotropy and which avoid unnecessary water saturation (Figure 10a-c in Farrow et al. (35)). The measurements were performed at 30 °C. The spectral widths were 8000 Hz in the 1H dimension and 2000 Hz in the 15N dimension. The 1H and 15N transmitter frequencies were set to 4.74 and 119.6 ppm, respectively. The spectra were acquired with 128 t1 increments of 512 complex points using sensitivity-enhanced detection in the 15N dimension. In the case of the R and R measurements, 1 2 the pulse delay (between transients) was set to 1.6 s, 4 scans were added for each FID, and the data accumulation was preceded by 32 steady-state transients. The CPMG spinecho delay in the transverse relaxation rate measurement was 450 ms. In the case of the steady-state NOE measurement the pulse delay was set to 5 s, with or without 3 s of 1H saturation, with 8 scans added for each FID and 8 steadystate transients before the first t1 increment. Delays used for the R1 measurements were 11.0, 121.3, 231.5, 341.7, 452.0, 562.5, 672.5, and 1334 ms. The delays used for R2 measurements were 33.2, 66.4, 99.6, 132.9, 166.1, 199.3, and 265.7 ms. The relaxation experiments were carried out with these relaxation delays in random order. The NMR data, except for the NMR relaxation data (see below), were processed using Varian software (VNMR 4.3 and 5.2) running on SUN Sparc workstations. Processed 2D and 3D spectra normally contained 2048 × 2048 and 512 × 64 × 1024 real data points, respectively. Spectral analysis was performed with the interactive graphics computer program ANSIG v. 3.2 (36, 37). EValuation of Relaxation Data. NMR spectra were processed and evaluated using Felix version 2.3 on a Silicon Graphics Indy workstation. The spectra were processed using cosine and cosine-squared window functions, and the baseline was corrected in the 1H dimension. Felix macros and FORTRAN programs from the package ModelFree 3.1 (Drs. M. Akke and A. Palmer, III, Columbia University; 38) were used for data extraction and evaluation. Resonance intensities were obtained as peak heights. Noise levels were obtained from repeated experiments, and random errors in measured relaxation rates were estimated using Monte Carlo simulations (38). The error in the steady-state NOE measurements was estimated by repeating the measurement once. The average steady-state NOE of the two measurements is presented. The relaxation data were quantified using well-known relations between relaxation rates and spectral densities (39).

Hansson et al. The spectral density function derived by Lipari and Szabo (40, 41) was applied to interpret experimental data in terms of physically meaningful parameters. First, the overall rotational correlation time was estimated to be c ) 5.5 ns from the average R1/R2 ratio for the structured peptide fragments V219-L244 and W251-E271. This procedure to obtain c is motivated because the R1/R2 ratio is sensitive to c, but insensitive to the generalized order parameter, S2, and internal correlation time, e, if internal motions are restricted, i.e., when S2 > 0.7. Residue-specific S2 and e values were then calculated from measured R1 rates and {1H}15N NOEs and the calculated c by minimizing a sumof-squares target function for each residue i: i2 ) (R1,exp,i - R1,calc,i)2/R1,i2 + (NOE1,exp,i - NOE1,calc,i)2/NOE,i2 where indices "exp" and "calc" represent experimentally and backcalculated values, respectively, and  is the experimental standard deviation. Errors in S2 and e were estimated in each case on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations in which normal distributions with R1,exp and NOE1,exp as mean values and R12 and NOE2 as variances were assumed. NOE Distance Restraints. Distance restraints were quantified from NOEs assigned in a 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum recorded with a 75 ms cross-relaxation mixing time and in 2D NOESY spectra with 60 ms mixing time. Most NOEs involving aromatic side chains were assigned in a 60 ms NOESY spectrum recorded in D2O. Ambiguities in the NOE assignments could be resolved either in spectra obtained at 40 °C or by inspection of preliminary structures. The conversion of NOE cross-peak volumes into distances was based on calibration of observed NOEs typical for -sheets against known distances within regular -sheets (42). The NOE data were classified into three groups: strong, medium and weak, corresponding to distance limits of 1.8-2.8, 1.83.5, and 1.8-5.0 Å, respectively. NOE assignments and volume integrations were made within the ANSIG program (36, 37). Pseudoatom and multiplicity corrections of NOEs involving methyls or equivalent groups, i.e., methylene or diastereotopic groups, were carried out according to Fletcher et al. (43). Dihedral Angle Restraints and Stereospecific Assignments. Restraints for  dihedral angles were derived from 3JHNHR coupling constants measured in the 3D HNHA spectrum (33); for 3JHNHR > 8 Hz, the  dihedral angle was restrained to -120((60)°, and for 3JHNHR > 9 Hz the  dihedral angle was restrained to -120((40)° (44). No corrections for differential relaxation effects were made. Heteronuclear couplings, 3JNH , measured in 3D HNHB (34), and 3JR , estimated from short mixing time 15N-edited TOCSY spectra, in combination with observed short mixing time NOE intensities, were used to define 1 rotamers and assign -methylene hydrogens stereospecifically (45). Stereospecific assignments of the CH3 groups and identification of the 1 rotamer in a valine residue were made by analyzing the 3JHRH coupling constant in a DQF-COSY spectrum and the intensities of NOEs between H and HN protons in a 2D NOESY spectrum. Structure Calculations. Structure calculations and analyses were carried out on a Digital DEC Alpha computer with parallel processors and Silicon Graphics Indy and Indigo workstations using X-PLOR 3.1 (46), InsightII v. 2.3.0 (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA), and Procheck-NMR (47). Structures were calculated and refined with X-PLOR

using the ab initio simulated annealing (SA) protocol, "sa.inp", and SA refinement protocol, "refine.inp" (pages 311-314 and 316-319, respectively, in ref 46). Extended peptide conformations were used as starting structure for the ab initio SA. All force constants, parametrization of potentials, molecular parameters, etc. were set to their default values, as in the original sa.inp and refine.inp protocols, throughout the calculations, with the exception of the van der Waals radii scale factor ("repel"), which was decreased to 0.8 (instead of to 0.75) during the final cooling stages in the refinement. A center averaging pseudoatom correction was used for all distance restraints. The temperature in sa.inp was initially set to 1500 K, and it was decreased in steps of 50 K (1.07 ps/step) during cooling to 100 K. The structures generated by the SA procedure were refined using SA refinement in two steps. In the first step the annealing temperature was set to 1000 K followed by cooling to 100 K in steps of 50 K (1.11 ps/step). In the second step, additional distance restraints from hydrogen bonds were added (see below) and the temperature of the system was raised to 400 K followed by cooling to 100 K (steps of 25 K, 1.67 ps/step). The SA refinement was followed by 2500 steps of Powell energy minimization. From an ensemble of 50 calculated structures, 42 converged structures were selected on basis of the total energy (Figure 1A). This selected ensemble is denoted SA . An average structure, SAave, was calculated by averaging superimposed coordinates. This average structure was energy minimized (and denoted SAave-min) using the same procedure and potentials as in the last energy minimization of the ensemble structures. The structures in SA were analyzed with respect to precision of atomic positions and dihedral angles, restraint violations, deviations from idealized bond geometries, and nonbonded interaction potentials and was further characterized with respect to backbone confor-

mation and hydrogen bonds. The ensemble structures were searched for intramolecular backbone hydrogen bonds using the following two criteria: a distance between the donor hydrogen and the acceptor oxygen of less than 2.5 Å and a donor nitrogen-hydrogen-acceptor oxygen bond angle larger than 90°. Hydrogen bonds that fulfilled these criteria in a majority of the ensemble structures were then included as distance restraints in the final refinement step. Two distance restraints were added for each hydrogen bond: one for the distance between the donor hydrogen and acceptor oxygen (1.8-2.4 Å) and one for the distance between donor nitrogen and acceptor oxygen (2.6-3.2 Å). The hydrogen bonds used in the final refinement are reported in Table 1 together with a few additional hydrogen bonds that could be resolved in the final ensemble.

Dihedral angle order parameters, Sangle, were calculated according to Hyberts et al. (48). A value of Sangle approaching unity indicates a very well-defined dihedral angle whereas Sangle ) 42-1/2 ) 0.154 (for 42 structures) corresponds to an isotropic distribution. Sequence Alignments and Structural Comparisons. The sequence of Btk SH3 was aligned with sequences of SH3 domains from Itk, c-Src, Fyn, Grb2, Lck, and Abl. Atomic coordinates for c-Src, Fyn, and Grb2 were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank except for the Itk SH3 coordinates, which were kindly provided by Amy Andreotti at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, MA. The PDB entries for the compared structures are 1srl for the c-Src SH3 (49), 1nyf for Fyn (50), and 1gfc for Grb2 (51). Root mean square deviation (rmsd) values for CR atom positions were measured using InsightII v. 2.3.0. Backbone structure comparisons were made on the basis of CR-based torsion angles (52). CR torsion angles, R(i), where i is the residue number, were defined as the dihedrals CR(i - 1)-CR(i)-CR(i + 1)-CR(i + 2) as described by Flocco and Mowbray (52). Differences in CR torsion angles, R, between various proteins were calculated on the basis of aligned SH3 sequences by matching the position of residue i in the two proteins. Sequence numbers in Figure 10 refer to the CR(i) residues in the Btk SH3. RESULTS Analysis of NMR Spectra. Spin system identification and and 15N resonance assignments were made in DQFCOSY, TOCSY, and TOCSY-HSQC spectra. Sequential resonance assignments were carried out in 150 ms 3D
1H

NOESY-HSQC and 150 and 200 ms 2D NOESY spectra using standard methods (42, 53) and, also, using a 15N-edited HSQC-TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC spectrum. Most NOEs were assigned in a 75 ms 15N-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC spectrum and in a 60 ms 2D NOESY spectrum. Some NOEs, in particular those involving aromatic side chains, were assigned in a 60 ms 2D NOESY spectrum recorded on the D2O sample. No backbone amide resonances in the N-terminal fragment G1-S2-M3-S212 could be detected, and no long-range NOEs involving the eight N-terminal and two C-terminal residues of the protein were observed. Figure 2 shows an assigned 15N HSQC. Unusual 1H-shifts were observed for two side chains, P265 and S266. The 1H chemical shifts for S266 are 2.71 ppm (HR) and 1.83 and 1.62 ppm (H ), and those for P265 are 3.77 (HR), 1.16 and 1.01 (H ), 0.46 and 0.34 (H), and 2.63 and 2.49 (H). All 1H and 15N chemical shift assignments are available as Supporting Information. Stereospecific assignments of H resonances and identification of predominant 1 dihedral angle rotamers were possible for 22 residues. For one of three valines, V220, the CH3 resonances were stereospecifically assigned and the side chain 1 angle was determined to be in a g+ conformation. Backbone  dihedral angles were determined for 29 residues. The total number of dihedral angle restraints in the structure calculations was 52, and the number of NOEderived distance restraints was 756. Most distance restraints involve residues in the structured fragment K217-A272. Eleven hydrogen bonds that fulfilled the criteria described in the Materials and Methods section were found in the analysis of preliminary structures, and these were added as

22 hydrogen bond distance restraints. Five additional hydrogen bonds were found in the analysis of the final SA ensemble. These are all reported in Table 1. Structural restraints are summarized in Table 2. Presence of Two Equilibrium Conformations. Several residues in Btk SH3 display two sets of resolved NMR resonances with unequal (major and minor form) intensities. These residues are distributed throughout the protein sequence, although the two forms are not spectroscopically distinguishable within the N- and C-terminal regions or for residues R236-G238 and S247-L249. In the structure, the largest chemical shift differences for backbone amides are within four regions, which are further discussed below. On the basis of relative intensities, we estimate that the concentration ratio of major and minor forms is 7:1. To verify that the observation is due to two conformations of Btk SH3 in equilibrium we recorded long mixing time NOESY spectra at 50 °C. Figure 3 shows the diagonal resonances of the major and minor forms of W252 sidechain 1HN 1 in a 750 ms NOESY spectrum at 50 °C. Under these conditions we detect exchange cross-peaks between

the two diagonal peaks. They indicate the presence of an exchange process between two protein conformations in equilibrium on a time scale of seconds. We have determined the structure of the predominant (major) form of Btk SH3. The low relative concentration of the minor form with accompanying weak NOE intensities prohibits a detailed structural characterization of this form. Still, all NOEs corresponding to the minor form that could be securely assigned are also present in the major form with similar relative intensities. The chemical shift differences between major and minor form resonances are also relatively small with a maximum amide proton shift difference of 0.15 ppm for the amide 1H resonance of M226. These observations suggest that the two forms are structurally similar, as further discussed below. Structure Calculations. An ensemble of 50 SA structures was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. The distribution of X-PLOR energies of these is shown in Figure 1A, together with the corresponding distance restraint energies (Figure 1B). It is obvious that about 42-44 of the 50 structures have converged to an energetically similar state and that the 6-8 remaining structures are less well refined regarding total and distance restraint violation energies. On the basis of this observation, we have chosen the 42 structures with the lowest total energy as a representative set of the experimentally determined Btk SH3 structure. The structural statistics of this SA ensemble is summarized in Table 3. A backbone superposition of structures in SA is shown in Figure 4A. The average atomic rmsd of the SA structures of Btk SH3 from their mean coordinates is 0.55 Å ((0.16 Å) for the backbone heavy atoms (N, C, CR) and 1.15 Å ((0.15 Å) for all heavy atoms, when analyzed for residues

In the potential binding site, defined as residues Y223-D232, W251, S266, and Y268 on the basis of sequence similarities, the rmsd is 0.28 Å ((0.15 Å) for the backbone atoms and 0.79 Å ((0.15 Å) for all heavy atoms. The large difference between the rmsd for backbone and all heavy atoms in the ligand-binding site can be understood because many side chains in this region are exposed on the protein surface and are therefore not well defined by long-range NOE restraints. For residues forming the hydrophobic core in Btk SH3 (identified by inspection), the rmsd for the backbone atoms and for all heavy atoms are 0.20 Å ((0.09 Å) and 0.45 Å ((0.11 Å), respectively. The structures in SA satisfy the experimental restraints well, as judged by the low number of small distance and dihedral angle restraint violations. The local stereo-

chemistry is also very reasonable, as judged on the basis of average deviations from idealized covalent geometry (Table 3). Some results from Ramachandran plot analyses of SA and of SAave-min using Procheck-NMR (47) are presented in Table 3. A Ramachandran plot of K217-E273 of SAave-min is shown in Figure 5. There are no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram either for SA or for SAave-min. The majority (95.9% for SA and 93.2% for SAave-min) of the residues are within most favored or additional allowed regions. Four residues in SAave-min (M3, A230, E246, and T270) have backbone conformations that fall within generously allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram. Except for T270, these residues are located in more flexible regions of the protein (see above). For T270, the unfavorable backbone conformation can be explained by a hydrogen bond between its amide proton and

The low values of S and S do not correspond to low S2, though the intensity of the {1H}15N steady-state NOE for residue N258 (data not shown) is somewhat lower than in the structured domain (spectral overlap prohibits relaxation measurements on K257). The number of NOEs defining these two regions is low. Thus, these parts of the structure are less well determined, based on the structure calculations, but not inherently flexible on the pico- to nanosecond time scales. Description of the Structure. The structured part of Btk SH3 consists of five -strands that are packed in two -sheets forming a -sandwich, typical for SH3 domains (Figures 4B and 4C). The first -strand, 1, starts with the K217 and ends with A221. L222-G238 forms the RT loop, with the highly conserved Y223 at the edge of the potential binding site and the nonconserved M228-N229-A230 forming a flexible, turnlike part of this loop at the other end of the binding site. The fragments D224-P227 and D232-L235 run antiparallel to each other and form a well-defined segment of the RT loop. The backbone amide proton of L235 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl of Y225 and L233. Residues R236-K237-G238 form a turn that resembles a Type II -turn, but the conformation could not be securely defined due to spectral overlap involving crucial NOEs. This sequence is partially conserved among different SH3 domains (Figure 7), and in c-Src SH3 it forms a Type II -turn (49). The second -strand, 2, consists of five residues: D239, E240, Y241, F242, and I243. D239F242 is antiparallel to 1, and Y241-I243 is antiparallel to A254-D256 within the third -strand, 3, which consists of residues R253 to D256. The backbone amide protons of Y241 and F242 form hydrogen bonds with backbone carbonyls of V219 and R255, respectively. The partially flexible loop between 2 and 3 corresponds to the n-Src loop. The fourth -strand, 4, is formed by residues Q260, E261, G262, and Y263. 3 and 4 run antiparallel to each other with hydrogen bonds between A254 and G263 and between D256 and Q260 and, also, between P250 and S266 and between W252 and I264. Residues K257, N258, and G259 form a turnlike loop between 3 and 4. S266, N267, and Y268 are all highly conserved among SH3 domains and form a right-handed helix-like loop between 4 and the fifth -strand, 5 consisting of residues V269, T270, and E271. 5 is antiparallel to 1 with a hydrogen bond between V220 and T270. A surface analysis of Btk SH3 reveals that 56% of the total surface area, 5292 Å2, is polar. The hydrophobic core consists of residues V219, L233, L235, Y241, I243, A254, I264, and V269, which are well conserved among SH3 domains. The surface of the potential binding site involves the conserved residues Y223, D224, Y225, D232, W251, P265, and Y268 (see Lim et al. (54) for a discussion about binding sites in SH3 domains). They form a continuous surface as illustrated in Figure 8. The autophosphorylated Y223 is located at one end of this surface, and the other side is flanked by residues in the partially flexible RT loop. Several other hydrophobic side chains are exposed or partially exposed on the surface, including V220, L222, M226, P227, M228, F242, L244, L249, and P250.

Backbone Dynamics. The generalized order parameters for backbone dynamics (S2), determined on the basis of R1, R2, and {1H}15N steady-state NOE measurements, are plotted on a per-residue basis in Figure 6A. S2 can be interpreted as the degree of restriction of the NH bond vector on a time scale characterized by the internal correlation time, which is shorter than the correlation time for rotational diffusion of the entire protein. S2 ranges from 0 for completely unrestricted internal motion to 1 in the absence of internal motions. Considering these data, the structured domain of Btk SH3 seems to be from residue K217 to A272. With some exceptions these residues all have high values of S2, whereas the eight N-terminal and three C-terminal residues are more flexible. Conformational flexibility in the N- and C-terminal regions explains the high atomic rmsd (Figure 6B) and low angular order parameters obtained for  and  dihedral angles (S and S; Figures 6C and 6D) for these residues. As already mentioned, no long-range NOEs were observed for the eight N-terminal and two C-terminal residues (Figure 6E). There are two additional regions within the otherwise structured domain that seem to be flexible, where lower S2 values correspond to lower S and S values and higher rmsd. These are residues M228-N229 and S247-N248 (relaxation measurements were not possible for A230 and E246, due to spectral overlap). Both regions are surface-exposed and are located within the RT and n-Src loops, respectively. Two additional regions, residues R236-K237 and K257-N258G259, show some disorder among the calculated structures as judged from backbone rmsd, S, and S. In the structure R236-K237-G238 form a turn (resembling a Type II

DISCUSSION In the present study we have determined the solution structure of the Btk SH3 and have also investigated dynamic properties. The precision of the calculated structures is good as judged from rmsd from mean coordinates and the local stereochemistry is also very reasonable. The lower precision obtained for certain regions, e.g. the RT and n-Src loops, can in most cases be attributed to rapid internal motions or surface exposure. Below we discuss the origin of the observed slow conformational exchange, the functional role of the autophosphorylated Y223 residue and compare the

Btk SH3 structure with the structures of some other SH3 domains. Mechanism for Conformational Exchange. The existence of two conformations of Btk SH3 in solution is apparent, though the biological relevance of this, if any, is unclear. The backbone conformations of major (predominant) and minor forms appear to be quite similar. This is because the chemical shift differences are small and because observed backbone amide NOEs for the minor form are similar to those of the major form. The largest backbone shift differences are found within four distinct regions of the

structure, as illustrated in Figure 9. These regions are residues M226, D232, and L233 within the RT loop (I), G262-I264 in 4 and A254 in 3 (II), N267 and Y268 within the helix-like loop and L222 (III), and residues L244 and E245 within the n-Src loop (IV). The exchange between the two conformations occurs on a time scale of seconds. Intramolecular conformational exchange on this time scale has been attributed to proline cis-trans isomerizations (see e.g. ref (55) and slow reorientations of tryptophan aromatic rings (56). These mechanisms appear most plausible, although other possibilities cannot be excluded. Btk SH3 contains three proline (P227, P250, and P265) and two tryptophan residues (W251 and W252). If we first consider proline cis-trans isomerization, this mechanism cannot involve P250, because backbone resonances around this proline exhibit only very small shift differences between the two forms. P227 is located quite far from most of the residues with large backbone shift differences. For P265 we observe minor form NOEs between the HR of I264 and H1 and H2 of P265 (data not shown), indicating that the minor form conformation of P265 is trans as in the major form. Thus, proline cis-trans isomerization is not likely to be the cause of the conformational exchange. A tryptophan side chain reorientation or "flip" results in multiple protein conformations e.g. in the human R3-chain type VI collagen C-terminal Kunitz domain (56). The exchange rate was also in this case found to be rather slow

FIGURE 9: Backbone trace of Btk SH3. Regions with the largest chemical shift differences between the major and minor forms are colored in black. Indicated and displayed are also the side chains of Y225, W251, W252, and Y268. Residues with large chemical shift differences are K218 (15N, 0.38 ppm; NH, 0.01 ppm), L222 (0.19 ppm, 0.04 ppm), Y225 (0.03 ppm, 0.05 ppm), M226 (0.40 ppm, 0.15 ppm) D232 (0.09 ppm, 0.06 ppm), L233 (0.19 ppm, 0.07 ppm), L244 (0.23 ppm, 0.20 ppm), E245 (0.08 ppm, 0.15 ppm), A254 (0.92 ppm, 0.08 ppm), D256 (0.31 ppm, 0.04 ppm), G262 (0.68 ppm, 0.02 ppm), Y263 (0.16 ppm, 0.06 ppm), I264 (0.36 ppm, 0.11 ppm), and Y268 (0.32 ppm, 0.10 ppm).

(1.0 s-1). In Btk SH3, the side chains of W251 and W252 both display rather large major/minor form chemical shift differences. A reorientation of the W251 aromatic ring can easily affect parts of the RT loop via the closely located Y225 side chain. Also the side chain of Y268 is close to W251 and could mediate conformational changes to the backbone around Y268 and L222. Residues G262-I264 in 4 are located near the aromatic ring of W251. Finally, the fourth region within the n-Src loop is located close to W252. A reorientation of W251 aromatic ring would most likely also affect the aromatic ring of W252, which then can affect part of the nearby n-Src loop. Thus, on the basis of the location of observed shift differences in relation to the W251 side chain, we favor a reorientation of this aromatic ring as the most likely cause of the conformational exchange in Btk SH3. Comparison of the Btk SH3 Structure with Other SH3 Domains. Figure 7 shows a sequence alignment of the Btk SH3 domain with Itk, c-Src, Abl, Grb-2-N, Fyn, and Lck SH3 domains.

residues are identical with Btk SH3. In comparison, c-Src SH3 has 24 residues in common with Btk SH3 and 43 with Fyn SH3. Figure 10 shows a comparison of backbone conformations of Btk SH3 with the other domains. The comparison is based on backbone CR dihedral angles (52). In this comparison, the Fyn and c-Src SH3 domains, both belonging to the Src family of tyrosine kinases, form the most "look-alike" pair (Figure 10E). The Btk SH3 backbone conformation is actually more similar to both Fyn and c-Src than to the Itk SH3, although the latter is the only SH3 structure from another Tec family kinase. These differences/ similarities are also apparent from superpositions of backbone

atoms: the rmsd between 432 superimposed backbone atoms (backbone atoms of 54 common residues) are 1.82 and 1.39 Å for Btk-c-Src and Btk-Fyn, respectively, but 2.54 Å in a Btk-Itk comparison. The corresponding number for a c-Src-Fyn superposition is 1.44 Å. Continuing the comparison between the Btk and the c-Src and Fyn SH3 domains, we find only minor differences in backbone conformations except for in the RT loop, the n-Src loop (of c-Src), and the turn between -strands 3 and 4. Notably, the n-Src loop conformation is very similar in Btk and Fyn but is different in Btk and c-Src (and in Fyn and c-Src). The conformation of the RT loop in Btk is altered

Solution Structure of the Btk SH3 Domain compared to Fyn and c-Src, where the loop takes very similar conformations. The residues of Fyn and c-Src that correspond to S266-Y268 in Btk form a short right-handed 310 helix in these proteins, and a similar conformation is found in Btk. We also find that the backbone conformation of a previously published model of Btk SH3 (11) compares well with the presently determined structure, except for a few residues in the n-Src loop. Thus, differences in the backbone conformation between the Btk SH3 model and the NMR structure are smaller than the differences between the experimentally determined Fyn and Btk SH3 structures (not shown). The observed structural differences between the Itk and Btk SH3 domains are somewhat unexpected. The two proteins obviously have similar overall folds, but significant differences in backbone conformations can be found in the N-terminal, the RT loop, the 2-strand, and in the n-Src loop. The differences may be attributed to the fact that the Itk fragment, for which the structure was determined, is extended in the N-terminal compared to the other SH3 domains. The N-terminal extension, which contains an SH3 polyproline binding motif, interacts with the binding site (17). The difference between the two Tec family SH3 domains and the similarity between Btk and SH3 domains in kinases and other signaling molecules suggest that ligand binding may alter the SH3 conformation in Tec family kinases, but additional studies are required to draw this conclusion. Structure and Function of Btk SH3. Bruton's tyrosine kinase has been shown to be activated through a transphosphorylation of Y551 within the kinase domain, followed by autophosphorylation of Y223 within the SH3 domain (22). In our structure, Y223 is exposed on the surface at the edge of the binding site (Figure 8). A phosphorylation provides a negative charge (as well as a steric exclusion) to this region which can be severely unfavorable for the interaction with a ligand. In the c-Src family tyrosine kinase Hck, a displacement of the SH3 domain occurs upon activation (20) confirming the key role of SH3 domains in regulation of tyrosine kinases. Recently, the crystal structures of inactivated Hck and c-Src kinases were solved (18, 19). In these structures the linker connecting the SH2 domain with the kinase domain acts as an intramolecular ligand for the SH3 domain. This is also a plausible mechanism for Btk regulation. Most of the binding surfaces of SH3 domains consist of conserved residues, mainly three tyrosines (Y223, Y225, and Y268 in Btk), one aspartate (D232 in Btk) and one tryptophan (W251 in Btk). Isolated peptide ligands also show a high degree of sequence homology. The residues involved in forming the (intramolecular) SH3 ligand, a left-handed PPII helix, are in c-Src residues K249-Q253 (KPQTQ), followed by G254 and L255, and in Hck as residues K249-W254 (KPQKPW). Corresponding residues in Btk are A384-L390 (APSTAGL), which can be derived from an alignment of the Btk kinase domain with those of Hck and c-Src. In the interaction between SH3 domains and peptide ligands there are five positions on the ligand surface where close contacts with residues on the SH3 domain are formed: P+3, P+2, P0, P-1, and P-3 (for the notation, see Lim et al. (54)). The P+3 position is normally occupied by a hydrophobic residue in SH3-binding peptides, most often a

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 9, 1998 2923 proline or an alanine. In both c-Src and Hck this position is occupied by a lysine (K249), though the corresponding residue in Btk is an alanine (A384). The P+2 position is held by P250 in the c-Src and Hck crystal structures. This critical residue is conserved also in other tyrosine kinases, as well as in Btk (P385), and is a proline also in SH3 binding peptides. The P0 position, which is a valine or leucine in many SH3-binding peptides, is a lysine (K252) in Hck and a threonine (T252) in c-Src. In Btk it is a threonine, T387. The P-1 position is held by P253 in Hck and Q253 in c-Src. The corresponding Btk residue is an alanine (A388). The P-3 position in SH3-binding peptides is normally held by a basic residue, which contacts the conserved aspartate in the binding pocket. This interaction is absent in both c-Src and Hck. Residues G254 and L255 of c-Src are present also in Btk: G389 and L390. Thus, the region of Btk which corresponds to the SH2-kinase linkers that bind to SH3 in the c-Src and Hck complexes is similar at many of the critical positions. At one place, where there is no similarity, the corresponding Btk residue is instead conserved compared to other known SH3-binding peptides. Thus, the Btk sequence supports the notion that intramolecular interactions of the SH3 domain, similar to those observed in c-Src and Hck, may be involved in the regulation of Btk function.
