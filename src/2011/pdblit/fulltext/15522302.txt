The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH7 and UbcH5B both show specific binding to the RING (really interesting new gene) domain of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase c-Cbl, but UbcH7 hardly supports ubiquitination of c-Cbl and substrate in a reconstituted system. Here, we found that neither structural changes nor subtle differences in the E2­E3 interaction surface are possible explanations for the functional specificity of UbcH5B and UbcH7 in their interaction with c-Cbl. The quick transfer of ubiquitin from the UbcH5BUb thioester to c-Cbl or other ubiquitin acceptors suggests that UbcH5B might functionally be a relatively pliable E2 enzyme. In contrast, the UbcH7Ub thioester is too stable to transfer ubiquitin under our assay conditions, indicating that UbcH7 might be a more specific E2 enzyme. Our results imply that the interaction specificity between c-Cbl and E2 is required but not sufficient for transfer of ubiquitin to potential targets.

Introduction
Posttranslational modification by ubiquitin is a major mechanism for regulating protein function in eukaryotes. The general enzymatic cascade of this pathway comprises three enzymes known as E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitinconjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin-protein ligase enzyme). The first step in this cascade is the ATP-dependent formation of a thioester bond bet*Corresponding author. E-mail address: r.boelens@uu.nl. Present addresses: R.

ween ubiquitin and E1, after which ubiquitin is transferred to the catalytic cysteine of an E2 enzyme forming an E2Ub thioester. Next, the E3 catalyzes the transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate, with which it forms an isopeptide bond. While HECT (homologous to the E6AP C-terminus) domain E3 ligases mediate this step by formation of a HECT-ubiquitin thioester intermediate, RING (really interesting new gene) domain E3 ligases facilitate a direct transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the substrate via noncovalent interactions with the E2Ub and the substate.1 In yeast, the substrate can be tagged by a single ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains, which can vary in length and linkage specificity. The functions of chains linked through K48 and K63 of ubiquitin have been established. The K48-linked chains are shown to target proteins for degradation via the 26S proteasome, while K63-linked chains recruit binding partners during inflammation or DNA repair.2 The E2 enzymes are the key enzymes in the ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like pathways. More than 30 structures of E2s from various organisms are available, and all these E2 proteins share a topologically conserved /-fold core domain of  150 residues. Four -helices (1­4) compose one face of the

508 protein, and a four-stranded antiparallel -sheet (1­4) sits on the back of the enzyme between helices 1 and 2 (Fig. 4). Every E2 core domain can bind three other proteins: the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, a cognate E3 ligase enzyme, and activated ubiquitin via a labile thioester linkage. E2 enzymes can gain additional functionality via association with additional domains or subunits.3,4 The complex of c-Cbl and UbcH7 was the first RING E3­E2 structure to be solved,5 but further structural insight into E2­E3 interactions comes from the HECT E3 E6AP complexed to UbcH7,6 the NMR-based model of the RING E3 CNOT4 bound to UbcH5B,7 and the U-box domain E3 CHIP/Ubc13­Uev1a complex.1,8 All these complex structures show equivalent elements in the E2­E3 interface and similarities in overall structure. The core interface is formed by a hydrophobic groove on the E3 and two main regions on E2: loop L1, located between strands 3 and 4, and loop L2, connecting strand 4 and helix 2. In sharp contrast to the wealth of knowledge on E2 structures, the best structural insight of the E2Ub thioester intermediate is limited to models based on NMR chemical shift perturbation data due to the inherent instability of the thioester complex.4,9 The human genome encodes a few E1s,1,10 around 30 E2s, several hundreds of E3s, and thousands of substrates for ubiquitin, which makes the ubiquitination pathway very versatile and highly complex. An E3 may have more than one substrate and some substrates can be recognized by multiple E3s.11 The large abundance of E3s relative to E2s implies that E2s can function with multiple E3 ligases, but the inverse situation also exists. For example, the RING E3 complex SCF shows in vitro polyubiquitination activity with both CDC34 and Ubc4,12,13 and the activity of the E3 APC is observed with both UbcH10 and UbcH5A, C.14,15 It is generally assumed that the binding ability of E2­E3 is the determinant of functional E2­E3 pairs, because decreasing the interaction between E2 and E3 also diminishes their poly- or monoubiquitination activity in vitro. Interestingly, Brzovic et al. found that the BRCA1/BARD1 E3 heterodimer can interact with UbcH5C and UbcH7 with similar affinity and a similar interface, but only UbcH5C was active in Ub-ligase activity assays.16 Other examples of E3s that can physically interact with some E2s but fail to support ubiquitin transfer to targets include the RING E3 heterodimer Ring1b/ Bmr117 and the U-box E3 CHIP.8 These results suggest that binding between E2­E3 pairs does not suffice for function. To address this paradox, we have analyzed and compared the c-Cbl/UbcH5B and c-Cbl/UbcH7 complexes both at a structural and functional level. The E3 ubiquitin ligases of the Cbl family are key regulators of signaling by many surface receptors. From the N- to the C-terminus, c-Cbl contains a tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, a linker region, and a RING domain, followed by an extensive proline-rich region and a ubiquitin-associated

(UBA) domain. The UBA domain of Cbl-b, a homolog of c-Cbl, has recently been shown to bind ubiquitin noncovalently and to promote Cbl-b UBA dimerization and is required for RTK ubiquitination in vivo.18 The RING domain can recruit the E2 and function as an E3 ligase.19 The c-Cbl RING E3 ligase can regulate receptor kinases via their ubiquitin conjugation and catalyze the ubiquitination of c-Cbl itself as well. This autoubiquitination of E3 enzymes is suggested to represent a regulatory mechanism to control the abundance of Ub protein ligases in cells, since E3 autoubiquitination mediates their proteasome-dependent degradation.20,21 Here, we studied the binding and functional specificity of UbcH5B and UbcH7 to c-Cbl RING using NMR structural analysis, chimeric UbcH5B/UbcH7 proteins, and in vitro activity assays, mostly by studying autoubiquitination of the c-Cbl RING domain. We found that although both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to the c-Cbl RING domain, only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination of c-Cbl and substrate, which suggests that the binding specificity between E2­E3 pairs does not necessarily suffice for their functional specificity.

Results
Ub-charged UbcH7 cannot mediate the autoubiquitination of c-Cbl Early studies indicated that c-Cbl can ubiquitinate epidermal growth factor receptor and Src in cooperation with UbcH7,22,23 while more recent work showed that c-Cbl promoted epidermal growth factor receptor and Src ubiquitination in a UbcH5Bdependent fashion.24,25 We tested if c-Cbl can form functional complexes with UbcH7 and/or UbcH5B using an in vitro autoubiquitination assay, which is a characteristic commonly used to identify functional E2­E3 pairs.26 To enable accurate quantitation of ubiquitinated c-Cbl, 32P-Ub-K63, in which all lysine residues except for K63 were mutated to arginines, was used in our assays to allow only monoubiquitination of c-Cbl. Figure 1a shows the efficient autoubiquitination of the c-Cbl linker and RING domain (amino acids 358­437) in the presence of UbcH5B (lanes 4­8). In contrast, UbcH7 was not active in this system even at very high protein concentration (lanes 9­13). These observations confirm the more recent results24,25 and suggest that the UbcH7/c-Cbl pair might be a nonproductive E2­E3 complex. Similar results were obtained using native ubiquitin allowing polyubiquitination (data not shown). To exclude a possible deficiency in our E2 isolates, we tested the integrity of our E2 enzyme preparations in an E2 activation assay (Fig. 1b). Both UbcH5B and UbcH7 showed efficient formation of ubiquitin­thioester linkages. We also tested the E2 specificity of c-Cbl ubiquitination using a larger c-Cbl construct (47­447) that was previously co-

crystallized with UbcH75 and observed that UbcH7 failed to support its ubiquitination as well (Fig. 1c). Finally, we examined whether UbcH7 and UbcH5B can support the c-Cbl-induced ubiquitination of Src, a nonreceptor-type protein tyrosine kinase. Our data show that Src was only ubiquitinated by UbcH5B (Supplementary Fig. 1). These data demonstrate that the c-Cbl­UbcH7 complex is a nonproductive E2­E3 complex in vitro, while under the same conditions, the c-Cbl­UbcH5B complex is productive. This indicates that the physical binding between an E2 and an E3 does not suffice for function. Therefore, we decided to test a number of factors that might explain the different functionality of UbcH5B and UbcH7 complexed to the c-Cbl RING domain. c-Cbl RING interacts with similar residues to UbcH5B and UbcH7 First, we tested the possibility that the two E2s might interact with subtly different c-Cbl protein interfaces. We addressed this question by NMR, because the changes in a [1H, 15N]-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) protein spectrum are a very sensitive marker to map residues that interact with other factors. We studied the interaction between E2 enzymes and c-Cbl using 15Nlabeled c-Cbl (358­437), which contains both the RING domain and the N-terminal H1 linker region previously implicated in E2 binding.5 In the follow-

ing discussion, c-Cbl refers to c-Cbl (358­437) unless specified otherwise. To identify differences between UbcH7 and UbcH5B binding to c-Cbl, we recorded a series of [1H, 15N]-HSQC spectra of c-Cbl to which increasing amounts of unlabeled UbcH7 and UbcH5B had been added. The c-Cbl backbone amide peaks sensitive to UbcH7 (Fig. 2a) binding belong essentially to the same residues that are also in the crystal structure in close proximity to UbcH7. The most perturbed residues in the NMR spectra of the complexes occurred in two c-Cbl regions: residues 383­387 in loop L1 and residues 404­420 in the helix H2 and loop L2 of the RING domain. In contrast to the crystal structure, we have no indications of UbcH7 interaction with residues in the c-Cbl linker H1 region. A comparison between the c-Cbl residues implicated in binding to UbcH5B and to UbcH7 shows that both E2s use a very similar protein interface (Fig. 2a and b; Supplementary Fig. 2). These data indicate that c-Cbl interacts with UbcH5B and UbcH7 in a structurally highly similar fashion. The titrations of c-Cbl with UbcH5B show fast exchange behavior for all NMR signals, whereas the titrations with UbcH7 show fast exchange behavior for most signals and intermediate exchange for signals with large changes in NMR chemical shifts. This allowed an estimation of the binding affinities of c-Cbl for UbcH5B and UbcH7 by fitting the curves

of the chemical shift changes upon titration with the two E2s (Fig. 2c). Fitting the binding curves (assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry) for three representative residues of c-Cbl gave dissociation constants (Kd) of 170 ± 96 M and 13 ± 3.8 M for UbcH5B and UbcH7, respectively. The larger error in the case of UbcH5B is due to the low solubility of 0.4 mM UbcH5B that prevents full saturation of c-Cbl. The overall resonance shifts in c-Cbl that can be reached upon full saturation with UbcH7 and UbcH5B are very similar (Fig. 2). The observed NMR exchange in the titrations indicates that the higher affinity for UbcH7 is largely due to a lower dissociation rate of the c-Cbl­E2 complex. The observation that c-Cbl bound stronger to UbcH7 might be explained by induced conformational changes in the c-Cbl structure that could affect E2 specificity. However, binding of the two E2s to c-Cbl did not cause chemical shift perturbations for residues distant from the E2 binding site, suggesting that no global c-Cbl conformational changes occurred upon binding. To address this question in more detail, we solved the free solution structure of c-Cbl and compared it with the c-Cbl­UbcH7 complex determined by X-ray crystallography. The c-Cbl RING domain does not show conformational changes upon E2 binding We obtained a high-resolution c-Cbl solution structure based on 1128 nuclear-Overhauser-effectderived distance restrains and 58 dihedral angles (Table 1). The RING motif is composed of two large Zn2+-binding loops, a short three-stranded antiparallel -sheet, and a central -helix (Fig. 3a). The overall structure of the central c-Cbl Ring motif as determined by NMR is very similar to other RING domain structures. A superposition of the solution structure of the free c-Cbl RING domain to the c-Cbl RING domain in the UbcH7-bounded complex shows that the structures are highly similar (Fig. 3b). One minor difference between both structures is the conformation of Pro395, which resides between the 1 and 2 strands. The NMR data demonstrate that it adopts a cis conformation in solution instead of the trans conformation in the crystal structure. The linker H1 region also forms an -helix in solution, but its orientation is not well defined with respect to the RING domain. This may be explained by the absence of the N-terminal TKB domain, which might stabilize this helix by direct interactions with the linker helix H1 Tyr368 and Tyr371 important in c-Cbl phosphorylation.27 Taken together, these data indicate that there is no evidence

for a conformational change upon c-Cbl RING binding to UbcH7. UbcH5B and UbcH7 bind c-Cbl with similar interfaces Next, we tested if the functional specificity of the E2­E3 complexes could be caused by structural differences in the E2 enzymes upon binding to c-Cbl. We studied the consequences of c-Cbl binding using NMR titration experiments reciprocal to those presented in Fig. 2. Unlabeled c-Cbl RING was added stepwise to 15N-labeled UbcH5B and UbcH7 from a 1:5 to a final 2:1 molar ratio. The largest chemical shift perturbations in UbcH5B and UbcH7 were located in the first helix H1, loop L1 between strands 3 and 4, and loop L2, connecting strand 4 and helix H2 (Fig. 4). UbcH7 displayed larger chemical shift changes than UbcH5B, in agreement with our observations on the c-Cbl side (Fig. 2). Already at a 1:5 molar ratio of c-Cbl:UbcH7, the majority of the UbcH7 L2 signals disappeared completely. The peaks belonging to L1 residues F63 and K64 disappeared at lower molar ratios but reappeared and shifted with increasing amounts of c-Cbl. We did not observe significant changes in the proximity of the catalytic cysteine upon c-Cbl binding to UbcH7.

(b) The solution structure of free c-Cbl RING finger domain (lime) superimposed on the crystal structure of the c-Cbl RING finger domain (gray) complexed to UbcH7 (PDB ID: 1FBV).

The chemical shift perturbations in UbcH5B observed upon c-Cbl addition were generally less pronounced. Most of the L1 and L2 resonances disappeared when the molar ratio approached 1:1. Some residues with low peak intensities disappeared upon complex formation, most likely caused by the increased size and lower tumbling rate of the complex. No significant chemical shift changes were observed in the proximity of the catalytic cysteine. In summary, these data suggest that UbcH5B and UbcH7 bind to c-Cbl with a similar interaction surface, and importantly, there was no evidence that c-Cbl binding induced changes in the catalytic center. The E2­E3 binding interface does not determine the functional specificity of the E2­E3 interaction Structural and mutagenesis studies of a number of E2s have identified three regions important for binding to the E3s: the first helix H1, loop L1, and

loop L2. Also, UbcH5B and UbcH7 interact with the c-Cbl RING domain using these same three regions (Fig. 4). The mechanism of the E2­E3 interaction is structurally conserved, but specific E2­E3 pairs use subtle variations of a fundamentally similar contact interface,5,6,8 which could explain the different consequences of UbcH7 and UbcH5B binding. It is currently disputed whether the specificity of E2s is dependent upon the composition of their L1 and L2 loops. To further characterize the importance of the E3 interaction regions H1, L1, and L2 and to test if any of these three regions causes the functional specificity of the E2 for the c-Cbl RING finger, we created three chimeric UbcH5B/UbcH7 proteins that have a UbcH5B framework with a small part of UbcH7 at the E3 interface (Table 2). In chimera 7H1, we replaced helix H1 of UbcH5B with helix H1 of UbcH7. Likewise, in the 7L1 and 7L2 mutants, we swapped UbcH5B loops L1 and L2 with the corresponding loops of UbcH7. First, we confirmed proper folding of the three chimeric proteins with [1H, 15N]-HSQC spectra (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The HSQC spectra are highly similar for residues not directly neighboring the substituted motif, which shows that the mutants adopt highly similar conformations. Second, we determined the averaged dissociation constants (Kd) of 7L1 and 7L2 by titration experiments as described in Fig. 2. Chimera 7L1 and 7L2 displayed a Kd of approximately 26 ± 9.6 M and 110 ± 41 M, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Next, we evaluated the chimeras by a number of functional assays. In an E2 activation assay, chimeras 7H1 and 7L1 formed thioester linkages to ubiquitin with UbcH5B wildtype-like efficiency (Fig. 5a and c). Chimera 7L2 possessed slightly less E2Ub active protein than wild-type UbcH5B. The changes in L2 might induce subtle conformational changes to the catalytic region because of its closer proximity. All three chimeras could ubiquitinate c-Cbl with an efficiency comparable to that of wild-type UbcH5B (Fig. 5b and d), while even the lower amount of 7L2Ub did not compromise efficient transfer of ubiquitin from 7L2 to c-Cbl. Although the c-Cbl binding affinity of 7L1 and 7L2 is higher than that of UbcH5B, this stronger interaction did not inhibit the ubiquitination of c-Cbl. For these E2­E3 complexes, there appears no direct correlation between the binding affinity and ubiquitination ability. Together, these observations indicate that the inability of UbcH7Ub to transfer ubiquitin to c-Cbl is not related to differences in mode and strength of E2­E3 interaction. The UbcH5BUb thioester shows greater reactivity than UbcH7Ub Since we ruled out both structural changes and subtle differences in the interaction region as possible explanations for the functional specificity of UbcH5B and UbcH7 in their interaction with c-Cbl, we focused on the intrinsic catalytic properties of the two E2 enzymes. Therefore, we studied the E2 reactivity of transferring the E2Ub thioester to

different ubiquitin acceptors including water, buffer, and thiol, which is called release rate here. After charging the E2 with ubiquitin, we assayed the time course of ubiquitin dissociation from E2Ub. By adding apyrase, we depleted the ATP needed for E1 activity and monitor E2Ub dissociation in the absence of E2 recharging. Under recharging conditions, the levels of UbcH5BUb and UbcH7Ub were stable for more than 3 h, since E2Ub formation and dissociation are in steady state (Fig. 6a). The addition of c-Cbl en-

hanced the ubiquitin release rate of UbcH5BUb, but not of UbcH7Ub (Fig. 6b). When recharging was blocked by the addition of apyrase, UbcH5BUb released ubiquitin from its thioester 10 times faster than UbcH7 (Fig. 6c and e). The addition of cCbl slightly slowed down ubiquitin release from UbcH5B (Fig. 6c and d), In contrast, CNOT4 and Apc2/11 can enhance the rate of ubiquitin release from UbcH5BUb.28 The release rate of ubiquitin from UbcH7Ub in the absence of recharging was not affected by the presence of c-Cbl (Fig. 6e).

The quick transfer of ubiquitin from UbcH5BUb to c-Cbl and to other acceptors suggests that UbcH5B might be a more active and relatively pliable E2, which could explain why many RING E3s can be ubiquitinated by UbcH5B. We also examined the ubiquitin release rate of the three UbcH5B/UbcH7 chimeras and found that they behaved like the wildtype UbcH5B (data not shown). In contrast, UbcH7 Ub is too stable to release ubiquitin to ubiquitin acceptors under our assay conditions, which indicates that UbcH7 could have a more restricted specificity. This intrinsic stability of the E2Ub thioester intermediate is unique for each E2, which suggests that understanding the factors that influence E2Ub thioester stability will help to understand E2 specificity.

could explain the functional differences. More likely, the different reactivity of the thioesters UbcH5BUb and UbcH7Ub might explain why c-Cbl/UbcH7 is almost "nonproductive" in vitro. The E2Ub thioester intermediate is a key intermediate in the ubiquitination pathway, which is the actual substrate for ubiquitin ligases and substrates. Unfortunately, the transient nature of this thioester makes studying its interactions with E3 very difficult. The NMR study of the formation of S22R­UbcH5CUb thioester showed that chemical shift perturbations on UbcH5C were not solely a consequence of direct contact with Ub but also induced by allosteric effects,4 which might explain the different properties of E2Ub and E2 in their interaction with E3 or substrate.

Discussion
In our experiments, we found that UbcH5B can support the in vitro autoubiquitination of c-Cbl and the c-Cbl-facilitated substrate ubiquitination but UbcH7 cannot. NMR titrations of c-Cbl to UbcH5B and UbcH7 did not show structural distinctions that A comparison of the electrostatic potential surface of UbcH7 and UbcH5B reveals striking differences (Fig. 7). Protein Interaction Property Similarity Analysis is a measure of electrostatic potential similarity and ranges from - 1 on full anticorrelation to 1 on perfect correlation between two potentials.29 Auto-

Fig. 7. Comparison of surface properties of UbcH5B and UbcH7. (a) Top: electrostatic surface potential of UbcH5B was calculated using the APBS plugin to PyMOL and indicated as a charge scale from negative (red) to positive (blue). Bottom: surface representation of interaction sites on UbcH5B. The catalytic site (yellow), E2Ub binding interface (cyan), E3 binding interface (orange), and the noncovalent Ub-binding interface on UbcH5B (green) are indicated. (b) UbcH7 electrostatic surface potential (top) and interaction sites (bottom), colored as indicated under (a).

ubiquitination of BRCA1 could be facilitated by Ube2w, UbcH6, and UbcH5, but not by UbcH7.30 UbcH5B has much less electrostatic potential similarity to UbcH7 (0.394) than it has to UbcH6 (0.678) and Ube2w (0.613). The biggest difference in electrostatic potential between UbcH5B and UbcH7 is observed at the -sheet implicated in noncovalent ubiquitin binding (Fig. 7), which corresponds to the fact that only UbcH5B can noncovalently bind to ubiquitin.4 Interestingly, the E2Ub thioester interfaces of UbcH5B and UbcH7 also display differences: although both are negatively charged, UbcH7 is more negatively charged both close to the catalytic cysteine and at the residues expected to bind Ub upon thioester formation.9 The increased stability of the UbcH7Ub thioester might be explained by this superior complementarity to the positively charged Ub thioester interface.

Functional specificity of UbcH5B and UbcH7 The intrinsic high stability of the UbcH7Ub thioester intermediate not only could explain why UbcH7 fails to transfer ubiquitin to c-Cbl but also suggests that other accessory factors might be needed to help the release of ubiquitin from the UbcH7Ub thioester to its substrates or E3. For example, the auxiliary protein Smad7 can recruit UbcH7 to the HECT E3 Smurf2 and regulates the catalytic activity of Smurf2 at the level of E2 recognition.20 Also, ubiquitination of Trk by UbcH7 and the TRAF6/E3 was carried out in the presence of p75 and p62.31 Although the E3 interacts with E2 on the common interface composed of helix H1, loop L1, and loop L2, E3s have their own preference for the binding position on E2s. For example, K63 of UbcH5B, F63 of UbcH7, and M64 of Ubc13 in loop L1 were important

CHISGST-Cbl (358­437) expression vector in minimal medium mainly as described before.35 Further details are provided as Supplementary material. Purification was carried out by binding the lysate supernatant to glutathione­agarose (Sigma) in buffer B (50 mM KH2PO4/ K2HPO4, pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 100 M ZnCl2, 0.2 mM PMSF, and 5 mM DTT), washing with buffer B plus 900 mM NaCl, and changing to buffer C (50 mM KH2PO4/ K2HPO4, pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 100 M ZnCl2, and 1 mM DTT) for glutathione S-transferase (GST) cleavage. The GST tag was cleaved on the glutathione­agarose beads by the addition of 2 U of thrombin (Sigma) per milligram protein at room temperature for 1 h and kept at 4 °C overnight. Protein was eluted by buffer B plus 500 mM NaCl. Thrombin was inactivated by the addition of 0.5 mM PMSF (final concentration). The c-Cbl sample was exchanged to buffer B and concentrated to a final concentration of 1.0­1.2 mM using a 5-kDa cutoff spin concentrator (Amicon Ultra-15). The unlabeled and 15N-labeled His-tagged UbcH5B and the 7H1, 7L1, and 7L2 chimera were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified on a nickel-charged Poros MC column (PerSeptive Biosystems).35 The overexpression of unlabeled and 15N-labeled GST-UbcH7 in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was performed as described previously32 and buffer exchanged to buffer B. NMR spectroscopy and structure calculation NMR experiments were carried out on Bruker AVANCE 600 and 700 spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance z-gradient probes. Standard spectra for resonance assignment and structure determination36 on c-Cbl (amino acids 358­437) were recorded at 298 K in a buffer containing 50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 100 M ZnCl2, 0.2 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT, 95%/5% H2O/D2O, and a small amount of complex protease inhibitor (Roche). All NMR spectra were processed using XwinNMR3.5 (Bruker) and analyzed using the program SPARKY.37 Structure calculations were performed using the program CYANA.38 The final structures were validated with WHATIF39 and PROCHECK.40 Molecular images were generated with PyMOL.41 NMR titrations Unlabeled UbcH5B and UbcH7 were prepared in buffer B. For the binding titrations, the [15N, 1H]-HSQC spectra of 100 M c-Cbl (358­437) in buffer B were recorded at 298 K and in complex with different stoichiometric ratios of UbcH5B and UbcH7 (1:0.25 to 1:1.5 for UbcH5B and 1:0.5 to 1:5 for UbcH7). Combined chemical shift perturbations were calculated using the equation ppm = ((HN)2+(N/5)2)1/2.28 The chemical shift changes were plotted against the molar ratio of Ubc:c-Cbl and fitted to standard 1:1 binding curves using the program Origin 8.0. For the reciprocal binding titrations, 15Nlabeled UbcH5B and UbcH7 were prepared in buffer B at a concentration of 100 M, and c-Cbl was added to them until a final ratio of c-Cbl:Ubc of 2:1. The 1H and 15N backbone assignments of UbcH5B and UbcH7 were from Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank entries 6277 and 15498,42,43 respectively.

in the interactions with CNOT4, c-Cbl, and CHIP, respectively,5,8,32 while the loop L2 residues of UbcH5C showed bigger perturbations upon binding to BRCA1/BARD1.30 The mechanism underlying the E2­E3 interactions and functions is not well understood, but it seems that dynamic, transient, and modest affinity interactions are more productive. Similarly as observed for the BRCA1/BARD1, the stronger binding of c-Cbl to UbcH7 did not facilitate ubiquitin transfer. Also, in the case of E6AP/ UbcH7, there was no correlation between the increased formation of ubiquitin­E6AP and enhanced binding affinity of UbcH7 and mutant E6AP.33 These results imply that the ubiquitination pathway might not be optimized for one particular pairwise interaction but is rather designed to function in its entirety. Together with our comparison of UbcH5B and UbcH7 in c-Cbl ubiquitination, this indicates that binding specificity only compromises a part of the functional specificity of E2 enzymes. Does the binding specificity of E2­E3s form the basis for their functional specificity? We believe the answer is yes, although the physical interaction between a functional E2­E3 pair is required, yet not necessarily sufficient to transfer ubiquitin to substrates.

Materials and Methods
Construction of plasmids The construct of wild-type human UbcH5B was amplified from a human cDNA library and cloned into the plasmid pLICHIS, a pET15B-derived expression vector, by enzyme-free cloning.34 The chimera 7H1, 7L1, and 7L2 (Table 2) plasmids were amplified from the plasmid pLICHIS-UbcH5B, and further details are provided as Supplementary material. The fragment encoding the c-Cbl linker and RING domain (358­437) was cloned from a human cDNA library into pLISHISGST vector.34 Correct constructions of these plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid of UbcH7 has been described before.32 The pGEX4T1 expression plasmid containing c-Cbl (47­447) was a kind gift from Dr. N. P. Pavletich (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). To allow 32P labeling of ubiquitin, we introduced a protein kinase A recognition site in the normal enzymefree cloning short forward 5 and LIC forward 5 primers to generate 32P-labeled Ub-K63, in which all lysine residues were mutated except for K63. PCR A was amplified from pET14b-Ub-K63 vector (kindly provided by Dr. R. Baer, Columbia University) with short forward 5 TGCGTCGTGCATCTGTTatgcagatcttcgtgaagac and LIC reverse 5 CAAGAAGAACCCCTCAcccacctctgagacggagtac. PCR B was performed with LIC forward 5 GCCGCGCGGCAGCCTGCGTCGTGCATCTGTTatgcagatcttcgtgaagac and short reverse 5 TCAcccacctctgagacggagtac. The hybridized PCR product of PCR A and B was cloned into the pLICHIS vector. Recombinant protein expression and purification

Purified ubiquitin was labeled in a 100-l reaction containing 4 l [32P]ATP, 4 l protein kinase A (5 U/l, Sigma P2645), 40­80 g protein in buffer 20 mM Hepes/ KOH, pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. After 30 min incubation at 30 °C, 32P-ubiquitin was purified using magnetic Ni beads (Promega) to separate radiolabeled protein from free label. Enzymatic assays (in vitro ubiquitination assay and thioester release assay) The standard reactions (15 l) of a E2Ub thioester formation assay contained 0.028 M E1, 0.5­10 M E2, and 0.2 M (1 × 104 cpm) 32P-Ub in a buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, and 5 mM ATP) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. For the c-Cbl autoubiquitination assay, 4 M c-Cbl (358­437) or c-Cbl (47­447) was added to the reactions and incubated for 90 min. In the competition assay, the indicated amounts of UbcH5B, UbcH7, and c-Cbl were included in the E2 activity reaction. For the release assays, 0.2 U/l apyrase was added to deplete ATP after the E2Ub thioester formation. Samples were taken at the indicated times, stopped by adding reducing or nonreducing SDS sample buffer, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. Accession codes Structural coordinates of the 20 lowest-energy structures were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession code 2K4D. NMR chemical shift assignments were deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank database under entry 15796.
