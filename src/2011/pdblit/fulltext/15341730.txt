(Structure 12, 1655­1667; September 8, 2004) We have recently discovered an error in our earlier work on the crystal structure of a LTB/CTB hybrid (LCTBK) in complex with an A type 2 pentasaccharide. The ligand used in the studies is GalNAca3(Fuca2)Galb4(Fuca3)Glcb and not GalNAca3(Fuca2)Galb4(Fuca3)GlcNAcb as originally reported (Glc instead of GlcNAc). No electron density was found attached to the glucose at position 2, which we wrongly interpreted as an indication that the N-acetyl group was flexible. Figure 1 was corrected for this error as well as for two other small mistakes, namely that the hydroxyl groups at position 4 of galactose and fucose are axial and not equatorial (correction concerns GalNAca3 and Fuca2). The new PDB code is 2NZG. We apologize for the mistakes, which, however, have no bearing for any of the conclusions drawn in this article.
