The Smad proteins mediate transforming growth factor­ (TGF ) signaling from the transmembrane serine-threonine receptor kinases to the nucleus. The Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) recruits Smad2 to the TGF receptors for phosphorylation. The crystal structure of a Smad2 MH2 domain in complex with the Smad-binding domain (SBD) of SARA has been determined at 2.2 angstrom resolution. SARA SBD, in an extended conformation comprising a rigid coil, an helix, and a strand, interacts with the sheet and the three-helix bundle of Smad2. Recognition between the SARA rigid coil and the Smad2 sheet is essential for specificity, whereas interactions between the SARA strand and the Smad2 three-helix bundle contribute significantly to binding affinity. Comparison of the structures between Smad2 and a comediator Smad suggests a model for how receptor-regulated Smads are recognized by the type I receptors. TGF signaling plays a central role in regulating cellular responses such as growth, differentiation, and cell fate specification (1). TGF signaling from the membrane to the nucleus is mediated by the Smad family of proteins, which contains at least eight members in vertebrates (2, 3). Two Smad proteins, Smad2 and Smad4, are tumor suppressors in humans (2, 3). The Smad proteins are divided into three functional classes: (i) the co-mediator Smads (co-Smads), Smad4 and Smad10, participate in signaling by diverse TGF family members; (ii) the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), including Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8, are each involved in a specific signaling pathway; and (iii) the antagonistic Smads, including Smad6 and Smad7, negatively regulate these pathways (2). To initiate a particular TGF response, a specific TGF ligand binds to a specific pair of transmembrane Ser-Thr receptor kinases, the type I and type II receptors, and this activates the Ser-Thr kinase in the cytoplasmic domain of the type I receptor (2, 4). The signal is then propagated by type I receptor-mediated phosphorylation of specific R-Smads. The R-Smads, Smad2 and 3, are recruited to the TGF recep1 Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Lewis Thomas Laboratory, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA. 2Cell Biology Program, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. 3Program in Molecular Biology and Cancer, Department of Medical Genetics and Microbiology, University of Toronto, Room 1075, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada M5G 1X5.

tors by SARA. This process appears to involve direct interactions between SARA and Smad2, SARA and TGF receptors, and Smad2 and TGF receptors (5). SARA does not interact with either Smad1 or Smad5 (5), which share 80% sequence identity with Smad2. These interactions are important in regulating specific Smad phosphorylation. The phosphorylated RSmad hetero-oligomerizes with the co-Smad, Smad4, translocates into the nucleus and associates with sequence-specific DNA binding proteins, resulting in the positive or negative regulation of agonist-responsive genes (2). The Smad proteins are conserved across species, with homology mainly in the NH2terminal MH1 domain and the COOH-terminal MH2 domain. Most tumor-derived mutations map to the MH2 domain that is involved in receptor recognition, interaction with transcription factors, and homo- and hetero-oligomerization among Smads (2). The MH2 domain of Smad2 or Smad3 interacts with an 85-residue Smad-binding domain (SBD) in SARA (5). The MH1 domain exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding activity and negatively regulates the functions of the MH2 domain. To examine the molecular basis of signaling specificity in receptor activation, we have determined the crystal structure of a Smad2 MH2 domain bound to a SARA SBD. In the crystals, SARA SBD exhibits an extended conformation, folding on top of Smad2 and shielding the hydrophobic residues on the surface of Smad2. Analyses of the SARASmad2 interface and the surface features of Smad2 give insight into Smad2 interactions with SARA and how R-Smads are recognized by the type I receptors. Characterization of Smad2-SARA inter-

action. To facilitate structural studies of a Smad2-SARA complex, we took a biochemical and cell biological approach to identify the minimal domains required for complex formation. Co-transfection of Smad2 and SARA followed by co-immunoprecipitation and protein immunoblot analysis (6) indicated that the Smad2 MH2 domain (residues 270 ­ 467), derived from a structure-based comparison (7), exhibited a weak interaction with SARA (Fig. 1A). Including nine additional NH2-terminal residues (residues 261­ 467) restored efficient interaction (Fig. 1A). To define the molecular determinants of binding, we examined Smad2 mutants for their ability to interact with SARA. The interaction does not require either the L3 loop or the H1 or H2 helices (Fig. 1B) (7), which interact with receptors at the membrane and transcription factors in the nucleus (8, 9). A single missense mutation in the strand B9, Asn381 3 Ser381 (N381S) (10), nearly abolished Smad2 recognition by SARA (Fig. 1A). This residue is subtype-specific among Smads, being an Asn in Smad2 and Smad3 but replaced by a Ser in Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Other subtype-specific mutations, such as Q294S and R337H, had little or no effect on Smad2-SARA recognition (Fig. 1A). Limited proteolysis on a Smad2-SARA complex was used to identify a 57-residue (665­721) trypsin-resistant fragment in SARA as sufficient for interaction with Smad2 (11). Proteolytic treatment of this isolated fragment destroyed the polypeptide and failed to generate any detectable structural cores (11). Thus, SARA SBD might adopt a flexible conformation that is stabilized by binding to Smad2. We generated a series of point mutations on SARA SBD and evaluated their ability to interact with Smad2 in an in vitro binding assay (12). Mutation of any of the four residues in SARA, Tyr 680, Cys681, Pro686, and Val703 significantly diminished complex formation between SARA and Smad2 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, point mutations such as Q688A and Q691A had no detectable effect on binding (Fig. 1C). Overall structure of the complex. To gain additional insight into the specificity in SARA-Smad2 interactions, we determined the 2.2 Å crystal structure of a Smad2 MH2 domain (residues 253­ 462) in complex with a SARA SBD (residues 665­721) (Table 1) (13). In the complex, SARA SBD adopts an extended conformation that consists sequentially of a rigid coil, an amphipathic helix, a proline-rich turn, and a strand (Fig. 2A). SARA SBD does not have a hydrophobic core, and its secondary structural elements do not interact with each other. Instead, the extended structure of SARA SBD covers a large surface area on Smad2 and interacts with multiple surface structural motifs on Smad2 that are as far apart as 40 Å. For example, the COOH-terminal strand of SARA SBD in-

teracts with the NH2-terminal strand B1 in Smad2, forming an antiparallel sheet. This sheet packs against a hydrophobic surface formed by helices H3 and H5 on Smad2 (Fig. 2A). Binding between SARA and Smad2 results in close packing of hydrophobic residues and buries 2573 Å2 of surface area. The interfaces involving the rigid coil and the strand in SARA contribute approximately 900 Å2 (35%) and 1150 Å2 (45%) buried surface areas, respectively. The four residues shown biochemically to affect binding (Fig. 1C) contribute to large buried surface areas upon complex formation (Fig. 2B). The Smad2 MH2 domain contains a central sandwich, with a three-helix bundle (H3, H4, and H5) and a single strand (B1 ) on one end, and a loop-helix region (L1, L2, L3, and H1) on the other end (Fig. 2A). The overall structural architecture is similar to that of Smad4 MH2, with a root-mean-square-deviation (rmsd) of 1.27 Å for 174 aligned C atoms (Fig. 2C). The similarity between these two structures is higher in the central sandwich, with an rmsd of 0.55 Å for 129 aligned C atoms. Two differences between the MH2 domains of Smad2 and Smad4 are likely to play important functional roles in signaling. The strand B1 is proteaseresistant and present in Smad2 MH2, but in Smad4 MH2 this region is protease-sensitive and likely unstructured (7). This strand comprises the NH2-terminal nine residues that are critical for interaction with SARA (Fig. 1A). The orientation of the three-helix bundle relative to the central sandwich is also different between Smad2 and Smad4. In Smad4, the large flexible linker between helices H3 and H4 is disordered; in Smad2, this portion is replaced with a well-ordered four-residue short linker. Consequently, the three-helix bundle in Smad2 appears to be more compact and is at a wider angle relative to the planes of the sandwich. Smad2-SARA interactions. The Smad2SARA interactions involve three contact surfaces from Smad2 and three corresponding secondary structural elements in SARA: the rigid coil, the amphipathic helix, and the strand (Fig. 3A). The hydrophobic surfaces on the Smad2 MH2 domain form two shallow grooves and one deep groove; the hydrophobic side chains of SARA SBD pack closely against these three grooves (Fig. 3A). The rigid coil (residues 671­ 682) binds to one of the shallow surface grooves that is created by residue side chains on strands B8/B9, and the short loop connecting helix H2 and strand B8 (Fig. 3B). In this region of SARA, the interacting residues that include Pro672, Pro674, Pro677, Tyr 680, and Cys681 form an extensive network of van der Waals contacts with the surface residues in Smad2. On Smad2, the interacting residues are Tyr 366, Trp368, Thr 372, Cys374, Ile376, Pro377, and Leu382. In addition to the van der Waals contacts, this part of the interface contains five intermolecular H bonds (Fig. 3B) that include two backbone-to-backbone contacts between Ser 682 on SARA and Lys383 on Smad2 and three backbone-to-side-chain contacts. In particular, the carbonyl O atom of Pro672 accepts a H bond from the side chain of subtype-specific Trp368 on Smad2, whereas Tyr 680 in SARA makes a H bond to the backbone amide of Lys375 on Smad2 (Fig. 3B).

The rigid coil has low-temperature factors in the crystals and an unusually compact conformation that is facilitated by three proline residues at positions 672, 674, and 677 (Fig. 3B). This rigid structure is strengthened by a network of nine intramolecular H bonds (Fig. 3B, right panel). In this network, Asn673 and Asn676 each mediate four H bond contacts. In the second part of the Smad2-SARA interface, an amphipathic helix from SARA binds parallel to the hydrophobic strands B5 and B6 on Smad2 (Fig. 3C). A sharp turn between the rigid coil and the helix is stabilized by intermolecular H bonds from the side chain of Asn381 on Smad2 to the backbone carbonyl group of Ile684 and to the side chain of Gln689 on SARA. In addition, the side chains of Ser 682 and Gln689 on SARA make two intramolecular H bonds to the backbone amide and carbonyl groups of Ile684, respectively (Fig. 3C). The importance of these interactions is highlighted by the observation that the single point mutation N381S in Smad2 leads to disruption of the Smad2-SARA interaction (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the extensive van der Waals interactions at the interface involving the rigid coil, only two residues from SARA, Pro686 and Ala690, contact the hydrophobic side chains of Tyr 339, Ile341, and Phe346 on Smad2 (Fig. 3C). In the third part of the Smad2-SARA interface, the COOH-terminal strand from SARA SBD forms an antiparallel sheet with the NH2-terminal strand B1 on Smad2, through five backbone-to-backbone H bonds (Fig. 3D). This chimeric sheet covers an exposed hydrophobic surface on helices H3 and H5 of Smad2. The side chains of Pro701, Val703, and Val705 from SARA are involved in multiple van der Waals contacts with the residues Ala391, Leu394, and Val398 on helix H3; Trp448, Gln455, and Met 456 on helix H5; and Tyr 268 and Val266 on strand B1 . Specificity of Smad2-SARA interaction. Despite 80% sequence identity between the MH2 domains of Smad1 and Smad2, SARA only binds the TGF /activin-regulated R-Smads, Smad2 or Smad3, but not the BMP-2/BMP-4 ­activated Smad1 or Smad5 (5). Our structural analysis of the Smad2SARA complex provides a molecular basis for this specificity (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4A). Five Smad2 residues that interact with SARA are subtype-conserved in Smad3, but are replaced by other residues in Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8 (Fig. 4A). Two of these residues, Asn381 and Trp368, participate in H bonds (Fig. 3B) and likely constitute the critical determinants of specificity in recognition of Smad2. The remaining three residues, Tyr 366, Ile341, and Phe346, stabilize the complex through hydrophobic interactions. Together, these residues define the subtype-specific recognition of Smad2 or Smad3 by SARA. Their role in signaling is illustrated by the detection in colon cancer of the relatively conservative mutation, F346V in Smad2, that likely leads to reduced van der Waals interactions between Smad2 and SARA (14). None of the five specificity-determining residues on Smad2 interacts with the strand in SARA, although the strand contributes 45% to the buried surface area. Thus, the recognition specificity is determined primarily from the rigid coil and helix of SARA interacting with the strands B8, B9, B5, and B6 of Smad2, whereas significant binding affinity is provided from the interface between the strand of SARA and the threehelix bundle of Smad2. To demonstrate the specificity in TGF signaling, we compared cellular localization patterns of SARA and either wild-type or the N381S mutant Smad2 using confocal microscopy (15). In cells expressing wild-type or mutant (N381S) Smad2 alone, the protein exhibited a diffuse staining pattern throughout the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 4B, top panels). In contrast, SARA alone displayed a characteristic punctate staining pattern (Fig. 4B, top panels). The localization of the wildtype Smad2 in the presence of SARA exhibited a dramatic change to a punctate staining pattern (Fig. 4B, middle panels). However, the localization of the mutant Smad2

(N381S) was not influenced by the presence of SARA, demonstrating that the mutant Smad2 has lost its ability to co-localize with the wild-type SARA (Fig. 4B, lower panels), consistent with the loss of binding in coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the impact of this mutation on TGF signaling, we performed a luciferase reporter assay with a TGF -responsive Mix.2 promoter (Fig. 4C) (16, 17). The mutant Smad2 failed to synergize with SARA to potentiate the TGF response whereas the wild-type Smad2 did synergize (Fig. 4C). Model of recognition between Smads and TGF receptors. Despite having generally similar structures, the MH2 domains of Smad2 and Smad4 have different surface features. A direct comparison of the electrostatic potential reveals the presence of a highly positively charged groove next to the L3 loop on Smad2, but not on Smad4 (Fig. 5A). This basic surface contains residues that are conserved in R-Smads but not in co-Smads, suggesting that this region might be important for receptor binding. Analysis of the type I TGF receptor (T RI) cytoplasmic domain reveals a complementary pattern on its surface. Specifically, the L45 loop, which specifies interactions with Smad2 (8, 18), is located immediately adjacent to the flexible GS region (19), which is phosphorylated upon ligand binding (20, 21, 22) and becomes very acidic. Thus, the phosphorylated GS region on the type I receptors might interact with a highly basic surface groove on R-Smads to provide binding affinity, whereas the L45 loop on the type I receptors recognizes the L3 loop of specific R-Smads to provide specificity (Fig. 5B). This model is consistent with biological and biochemical evidence. All pathway-restricted Smads share five basic residues in the basic groove, four of which are invariant. The variable basic residue, located on the L3 loop, is Arg in Smad2 and Smad3 (Arg427 in Smad2) and His in Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (His 425). This Arg and another subtype-specific residue on the L3 loop, Thr in Smad2 and Smad3 (Thr 430 in Smad2) and Asp in Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (Asp 428), are the specificity-determinants in the Smad-receptor interactions (8, 9). The position of these two residues next to the basic surface in R-Smads is consistent with the topological arrangement between the L45 loop and the GS region in the type I receptors. If interactions in the GS region contribute to binding affinity, they should be relatively nonspecific and tolerant of mutations. Consistent with this prediction, single or double point mutations of the Thr-Ser residues in the GS region had little or no effect on the signaling activities of the type I TGF or activin receptors, respectively (20, 21). Several mutations, such as T204D or T204E in T RI (20) and T206D in a type I activin receptor (21), result in constitutively active kinases. These mutations affect a Thr residue at the COOH-terminal end of the GS-region. On the basis of our model, the mutation from Thr to a negatively charged Asp or Glu could favor the initial apposition between T RI and Smad2, which should facilitate subsequent binding and phosphorylation. This model also places the COOH-terminal portion of SARA close to T RI, consistent with reported interactions (5). After phosphorylation, the COOH-terminal SSXS motif becomes highly acidic and could compete with T RI for binding to the highly basic surface patch next to the L3 loop, which would destabilize the Smad2-receptor complex (5). The details of recognition between the receptors and Smads will only be revealed by a

structure of the complex. For example, the T RI kinase domain in the crystal structure was in an inactive form (19). Phosphorylation of the GS region might induce additional conformational changes in the receptor that further facilitate interactions with Smad2. Other perspectives. The binding of SARA-SBD to Smad2 resembles p27 binding to the Cyclin A-CDK2 complex (23). For example, p27 also displays an extended structure and contains sequentially a rigid coil, an helix, and a strand (23). Both peptides interact mostly through van der Waals interactions; both contain a rigid coil contacting a shallow hydrophobic surface groove; both use an helix to connect to another major interaction interface; and both use a strand to pair up with an existing strand from the bound partner. The analogy can be extended to some details. For example, there is a conserved Trp residue at the surface groove of Cyclin 2 for interaction with the rigid coil from p27 (23); this feature is also present in the SARA-Smad2 complex (Fig. 3B). It is likely that the structure of Smad2 MH2 by itself includes two antiparallel strands at the NH2-terminus, one of which is displaced by SARA binding. This hypothesis is supported by several biochemical observations. First, a Smad2 MH2 domain beginning at residue 253 is not soluble by itself but

becomes highly soluble when co-expressed with SARA SBD, suggesting that the strand from SARA shields and rescues the exposed hydrophobic surface on helices H3 and H5. Second, a Smad2 MH2 domain beginning at residue 241 is soluble by itself, suggesting that residues 241­253 might play the same role as the strand in SARA. Third, a Smad2 MH2 domain beginning at residue 269 is not soluble either by itself or when co-expressed with SARA SBD, presumably because of the loss of strand B1 (residues 263­268), which eliminates the possibility of forming a sheet with SARA SBD. Our biochemical and structural analyses reveal a molecular basis for the specific recognition of Smad2 by SARA, provide a plausible model for receptor-Smad interaction, and serve as a framework for further elucidation of Smad functions in TGF signaling.

visualized on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels using tricine buffer. All stable fragments larger than 2 kD were identified through NH2-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometric analyses. 12. Mutant constructs were generated using standard polymerase chain reaction­ based cloning strategy, and the identities of individual clones were verified through double-strand plasmid sequencing. The Smad-binding fragment from SARA (residues 665­ 721) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)­fusion protein using a pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia) and was purified by a glutathione sepharose 4B affinity column. The MH2 domain from Smad2 (residues 241­ 467) was overexpressed in a pET3d vector (Novagen). The soluble fraction of Smad2 MH2 in the E. coli lysate was purified by cation-exchange chromatography (SP-sepharose; Pharmacia) and gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex-75 column; Pharmacia). Equimolar amounts of GST-SARA SBD and Smad2 MH2 domain were mixed and incubated in 25 mM NaMES (pH 6.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DT T). The complex was then passed through an cation-exchange column (SP-sepharose; Pharmacia), to which Smad2 MH2 domain binds avidly. GSTSARA SBD in isolation does not bind this column. Smad2 binding to the column has no effect on interaction with SARA. The bound complex was eluted from this column with 1 M NaCl and visualized on 15% SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 13. Proteins of the Smad2 MH2 domain and SARA SBD were individually purified and mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. The final complex was concentrated and purified through gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex-75 column; Pharmacia). The concentration of the complex is 20 mg/ml. Heavily twinned crystal clusters were grown at 4°C by the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method by mixing the SARA-Smad2 protein complex with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.5), 10% Dioxane (v/v), 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, and 10 mM DT T. Streak-seeding followed by three rounds of macroseeding eventually generated crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction. The crystals, with a typical size of 0.1 mm by 0.1 mm by 0.4 mm, are in the trigonal space group P3121, with unit cell dimensions a b 138.5 Å, c 55.9 Å, 90°, 120°, and contain two complexes in the asymmetric unit. Initial diffraction data were collected using an R-AXISIIC imaging plate detector mounted on a Rigaku 200HB generator. High-resolution data sets were collected at beamline X25 at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. All data sets were collected under freezing conditions; crystals were equilibrated in a cryoprotectant buffer containing 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.5), 10% Dioxane (v/v), 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, and 20% glycerol, and were flash frozen under a ­170°C nitrogen stream. The structure was primarily determined by molecular replacement using the software AMoRe [ J. Navaza, J. Acta Crystallogr. A 50, 157 (1994)]. The atomic coordinates of Smad4 MH2 were used for a rotational search against a 15­3.5 Å data set. The top 50 solutions from the rotational search were individually used for a subsequent translational search, which yielded one solution with a correlation factor of 20.8 and an R-factor of 52.4%. This solution was used to locate the second complex in the crystals. Together, these two solutions gave a combined correlation factor of 33.5 and an R-factor of 44%. This model was examined with the program O [T. A. Jones et al., Acta Crystallogr. A 47, 110 (1991)], and the Smad4 side chains were replaced with those of Smad2. Refinement by simulated annealing with the program X-PLOR (A. T. Brunger, Yale University), ¨ against a 3.0 Å native data set decreased the R factor and R free to 35% and 42%, respectively. Refinement against 2.2 Å resolution data allowed progressive identification of the SARA fragment. The final refined model contains two complexes of Smad2 (residues 263­ 456) and SARA (residues 669 ­709), and 243 water molecules. The NH2- and COOH-terminal residues in Smad2 have no electron density, and we presume that these regions are disordered in the crystals. The two complexes in one asymmetric unit are similar with a rmsd of 0.79 Å for all aligned C atoms. We only report here one representative complex. M. Miyaki et al., Oncogene 18, 3098 (1999).

Generating Solitons by Phase Engineering of a Bose-Einstein Condensate

Quantum phase engineering is demonstrated with two techniques that allow the spatial phase distribution of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to be written and read out. A quantum state was designed and produced by optically imprinting a phase pattern onto a BEC of sodium atoms, and matter-wave interferometry with spatially resolved imaging was used to analyze the resultant phase distribution. An appropriate phase imprint created solitons, the first experimental realization of this nonlinear phenomenon in a BEC. The subsequent evolution of these excitations was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Ultimate control over a physical system can be achieved by precisely manipulating its quantum mechanical wave function, which fully characterizes its state. A BEC of a dilute gas (1) is particularly well suited for such manipulations because of its directly observable wave function: It has many identical atoms in the same quantum state, and it is large enough to be optically imaged. We demonstrate two optical techniques to prepare and measure the phase of a BEC wave function. A chosen pattern of laser light

imaged onto a condensate shapes its phase almost arbitrarily in two dimensions (2­ 4). Matter-wave interferometry (5) using optically induced Bragg diffraction (6, 7) is then used to analyze the spatial phase distribution by direct imaging (8). These methods are applied in experimental studies of a phenomenon in nonlinear atom optics (9), the propagation of solitons [solitary waves (10)] in a BEC. Three-dimensional (3D) numerical calculations agree well with and substantiate the experimental observations of soliton generation and propagation. Both reveal the rich dynamics of this nonlinear system, such as the formation of multiple solitons. Theoretical background. Solitons are stable, localized waves that propagate in a nonlinear medium without spreading. They appear in diverse contexts of science and engineering, such as the dynamics of waves in shallow water (11), transport along DNA and other macromolecules (12), and fiber
