Separate Binding Sites on Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2) for GDP-Ran and the Phenylalanine-rich Repeat Regions of Nucleoporins p62 and Nsp1p
W. David Clarkson, Helen M. Kent and Murray Stewart*
MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) facilitates nuclear protein import through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Bacterially expressed rat NTF2 exists in solution as dimers and, when bound to Sepharose beads, is able to interact specifically with both the Ras-like GTPase Ran, and the xFxFG repeat containing domains of nucleoporins p62 (vertebrate) and Nsp1p (yeast). These interactions are sufficiently strong and specific to enable native Ran and p62 to be isolated from crude rat liver homogenates. Comparison of the sequences of the xFxFG repeat regions of p62 and Nsp1p indicated that NTF2 was probably interacting with the phenylalanine-containing core of these repeats and not the intervening hydrophilic linkers. Ran and p62 do not compete with one another for binding to NTF2, indicating that they bind to different sites on NTF2. These interactions could help target Ran and NTF2 to a series of putative docking sites for the importin-substrate complex located along the central transport channel of the NPC and so facilitate the passage of import material being transported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.

The import of proteins into the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is mediated by at least four soluble factors (reviewed by Gorlich & ¨ Mattaj, 1996; Simos & Hurt, 1995; Stewart & Clarkson, 1996; Sweet & Gerace, 1995). Proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) are recognised in the cytoplasm by importin-a (also called karyopherin-a). Importin-a forms a complex with importin-b (karyopherin-b, p97), which targets the NLS-containing substrate to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC where it appears to interact initially with components of the fibres that radiate from the NPC into the cytoplasm. Material is then translocated in an energy-requiring manner across the NPC into the nucleoplasm. The translocation step requires the Ras-like GTPase Ran (Melchior et al., 1993; Moore & Blobel, 1993) and NTF2 a 15 kDa protein also called NTF2, p10 or pp15 (Moore & Blobel, 1994; Paschal & Gerace, 1995) that interacts with GDP-Ran (Moore & Blobel, 1994) and also appears to bind vertebrate nucleoporin p62 (Paschal & Gerace, 1995) and yeast Nup36

(Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996). NTF2 exists in solution as a dimer (Kent et al., 1996; Moore & Blobel, 1994) ° and its structure has been solved to 1.6 A using X-ray crystallography (Bullock et al., 1996). The NTF2 polypeptide chain has a a-b barrel fold based on a remarkably curved b-sheet and, moreover, has a distinctive hydrophobic cavity that may indicate a putative enzymatic activity for the molecule and also function as a potential binding site for the interaction between NTF2 and other proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Two nucleoporins that have been associated with transport are vertebrate p62 and yeast Nsp1p. p62 forms a complex with p58, p54 and p45 (Buss & Stewart, 1995; Finally et al., 1991; Guan et al., 1995) and is constructed from a C-terminal a-helical coiled-coil rod domain and an N-terminal domain that contains 15 degenerate copies of the xFxFG sequence repeat (Buss et al., 1994; Cordes et al., 1991; Starr et al., 1990) found in a number of nucleoporin sequences (Rout & Wente, 1994). The protein is located near the pore axis on both nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic faces of NPCs (Guan et al., 1995). Yeast Nsp1p also contains a C-terminal coiled-coil and xFxFG domains, and

NTF2 Binding Sites

Figure 1. A, NTF2 binds bacterially expressed Ran and p62. Approximately 100 mg of p62 (lane 1) or Ran (lane 2) was mixed with 50 ml of NTF2-Sepharose beads, and incubated for one hour at 4°C. The beads were then washed with 3-4 times with 1 ml of buffer until no further protein was removed and examined by SDS-PAGE (lane 3 and 4). Both p62 and Ran clearly bind to NTF2-Sepharose, but neither p62 (lane 5) nor Ran (lane 6) bound significantly to 50 ml of BSA-Sepharose beads treated in an identical manner. Note that because NTF2 is a dimer usually only one polypeptide chain bound covalently to the Sepharose and so a prominent NTF2 band was always seen at 14 kDa. This was in marked contrast to BSA-Sepharose, which only gave a very feint BSA band because, as is a monomer, all BSA chains were linked to the resin. As identical quantities of proteins were always added to both sets of beads, the amount of protein eluted from the NTF2-Sepharose compared with the BSA-Sepharose was a good measure of the relative binding to each and thus of the likely level of non-specific attachment. B, NTF2-Sepharose binds p62 and Ran from rat liver homogenate. Lane 1: homogenised rat liver gave a complex series of different proteins and bands corresponding to Ran and p62 cannot be distinguished. Beads were incubated in the homogenate and washed exhaustively. Lanes 2 and 3 show SDS-PAGE of the material remaining bound to the NTF2- and BSA-Sepharose beads, respectively. Western blots using anti-Ran (lanes 6 and 7) and anti-p62 (lanes 8 and 9) confirmed the binding of these proteins to NTF2-beads (lanes 6 and 8), whereas no binding was detected in BSA-beads (lanes 7 and 9). Lanes 4 and 5 show anti-Ran Western blots of the rat liver homogenate before (lane 4) and after (lane 5) incubation with NTF2-Sepharose beads. Although the Ran signal was relatively weak in the homogenate, the level of Ran was clearly reduced by incubation with NTF2-Sepharose. The concentration of p62 in the rat liver homogenate was below the detection level of our Western blots. Sepharose bead binding assays: CNBr-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was swollen and washed in 1 mM HCl. The beads (1 g) were than transferred to coupling buffer (100 mM NaHCO3 , 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.3), and added to 5 to 10 mg of NTF2 or BSA in coupling buffer. Protein and resin were coupled whilst rocking for two hours at room temperature, and then any residual active groups blocked with 1 M Tris (pH 8.0), for two hours at 4°C. Non-covalently bound protein was removed by washing exhaustively in alternate changes of coupling buffer and acid wash buffer (0.1 M acetate, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 4.0). Absorption measurements indicated that greater than 90% of protein was successfully coupled to the beads. Protein coupled beads were stored in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2.5 mM KNa phosphate, pH 7.3), 0.1% (w/v) azide at 4°C. We assayed the active concentration of NTF2 on the beads by incubating 100 ml aliquots of NTF2-Sepharose slurry with 50 ml, 100 ml, 200 ml and 400 ml of a 1.4 mg/ml Ran solution for one hour and then determining the quantity of Ran remaining in the supernatant by its absorbance at 280 nm. These results indicated that 100 ml of NTF2-bead slurry was saturated by 70 mg of Ran and so 100 ml of beads contained approximately 100 mg of NTF2 that was able to bind Ran. This result was in good agreement with the estimate of 90 to 100 mg of NTF2 bound per 100 ml of beads we obtained from the residual absorbance remaining in solution when the NTF2-beads were prepared. To assess the binding of Ran and p62 to NTF2 beads 0.1 ml of 1 mg/ml purified, clarified protein was mixed with 50 ml of NTF2-Sepharose bead slurry and the volume made up to 1 ml with 50 mM imidazole (pH 7.0). These conditions resulted in an approximately threefold molar excess of Ran or p62 being present to ensure that the NTF2-Sepharose was saturated. The beads and applied sample were mixed on a turntable for one hour at 4°C. The beads were then spun down and washed with 50 mM imidazole (pH 7.0) until the wash was free of protein as assessed by PAGE of the supernatant. This repeated washing ensured that all non-specifically bound protein was removed. The beads were then boiled in sample buffer and the material examined by SDS-PAGE. Control experiments were conducted using BSA-Sepharose coupled beads. Competition experiments were conducted as described above, however, after completing the initial protein binding and washing stages, the sample was divided into aliquots and competitor proteins added in excess. The beads were incubated for a further half-hour on a turntable at 4°C, washed to remove unbound material, and then re-incubated with competitor again for a further half-hour. The beads were then washed thoroughly and examined by SDS-PAGE. Expression and purification of proteins: rat nucleoporin p62 and a series of truncation mutants (Figure 3A) corresponding to functional domains of the molecule were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (Buss et al., 1994; Buss & Stewart, 1995). Rat NTF2 was also expressed and purified as described (Kent et al., 1996). Canine Ran cDNA in expression vector pQE-32 (Gorlich et al., 1994), generously ¨ provided by Dr Dirk Gorlich (University of Heidelberg), was expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag as follows: ¨ continued opposite

Because BSA is monomeric, only a very feint BSA band was seen when BSA-Sepharose was analysed by SDS-PAGE.

Here we provide direct evidence that NTF2 binds to the xFxFG repeat-containing regions of p62 and yeast Nsp1p and show that the binding sites on NTF2 for GDP-Ran and these xFxFG repeats are distinct. We used a liquid phase assay based on NTF2 coupled to Sepharose beads to investigate its interaction with other proteins. Because NTF2 is a dimer, usually only one polypeptide chain bound covalently to the Sepharose and so a prominent

10 ml overnight 2 × TY Amp­Kan cultures of pQE-Ran in the expression strain BRL21(Rep4) were pelleted, washed and used to inoculate one litre volumes of 2 × TY Amp­Kan. These were incubated shaking at 37°C until the A600 reached 0.6 to 1.0, when expression was induced by adding IPTG to 0.4 mM. After three hours further incubation, cells were pelleted and stored at -20°C until required. Cell pellets were thawed in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 25% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, ruptured in a French press and incubated with 5 mg/ml DNase (Sigma D-4527) for 15 minutes to reduce viscosity. After clarification at 40,000 g for 20 minutes, the supernatant containing soluble protein was treated with 1 mM GDP in the presence of 5 mM EDTA to ensure complete exchange of Ran-bound nucleotides for GDP, then dialysed overnight at 4°C against 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF. After clarification, the dialysate was applied to a 25 mm × 100 mm column of Whatman DE52 ion-exchange resin and eluted with a 0 to 100 mM NaCl gradient. Fractions containing Ran were concentrated using Centriprep 10 K concentrators (Amicon) and applied to a 25 mm × 1000 mm Sephacryl S100 column in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM GDP, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF. Ran eluted with an apparent Mr of 25 × 103. Fractions were concentrated to 01 mg/ml and either kept at 4°C or quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C. The Ran produced from this construct had a (His)6 N-terminal tag but, during storage at 4°C, this tag was gradually removed by endogenous proteases. N-terminal sequence analysis of the resultant material (performed by Kate Sparks of MIP, MRC Centre Cambridge using an Applied Biosystems 477A pulsed-liquid sequencer) gave GEPQV indicating that the first four residues of the canine Ran sequence had also been removed. However, this material remained fully functional and was indistinguishable from His-tagged Ran in its binding to NTF2; NSP1 cDNA (Nehrbass et al., 1990) was a generous gift from Dr E. Hurt, EMBL, Heidelberg. A fragment corresponding to bases 784 to 1809 inclusive, which corresponds to the central xFxFG-repeat containing domain (Figure 3C), was amplified using PCR to introduce appropriate BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites, digested with these enzymes and cloned into the T7-based expression vector pMW172 (Way et al., 1990), which introduced four additional residues (MGSM) at the N terminus. This construct (termed Nsp1p-18R) was expressed in BL21(DE3) and fresh transformants were picked directly into one litre volumes of 2 × TY medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 34°C. The basal level of T7 polymerase was sufficient to initiate transcription and expression of Nsp1p-18R. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 25% sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM PMSF and stored at -20°C until required. Cells were lysed with lysozyme and the viscosity reduced by incubation with DNase I. After clarification at 40,000 g, the supernatant containing the soluble Nsp1p repeat-containing construct was dialysed overnight against 20 mM imidazole (pH 6.5), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol at 4°C. The dialysate was applied to a CM52 cellulose column and the Nsp1p-18R eluted using a 0 to 150 mM NaCl gradient. The material so obtained was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. A second construct, Nsp1p-19R, was obtained by cloning a HincII fragment corresponding to bases 684 to 1826 of Nsp1p into pUC18, and then subcloning into pMW172 using the BamHI and EcoRI sites from the pUC18 polylinker. This added short vector-coded sequences to the N and C termini (see Figure 3B). Expression and purification was identical to that for Nsp1p-18R. Mass spectroscopy of Nsp1p-18R gave a molecular mass of 36,200 (212) Da compared with a predicted mass of 36,320 Da. This difference indicated that the 130 Da N-terminal Met had been removed, which occurs frequently in bacterially expressed proteins (Lewin, 1994). Peptide sequencing of Nsp1p-19R was entirely consistent with its predicted amino acid sequence. As is also frequently found with proteins containing repeating sequence motifs, both Nsp1p constructs migrated more slowly than expected in SDS-PAGE. Rat liver homogenate: a fresh rat liver (020 g) was chopped and placed in two volumes of ice-cold transport buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 110 mM potassium acetate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 3 mg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin). The chopped liver was homogenised thoroughly in a Polytron omnimixer (Camlab, Cambridge, UK) followed by six strokes in a Dounce homogeniser. The homogenate was then clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti70 rotor at 200,000 g for one hour at 4°C. Cleared supernatant was removed from under the lipid surface layer. Samples were flash frozen and stored at -70°C for until required. SDS-PAGE and Western blots: SDS-PAGE of proteins was carried out using 7.5% to 17.5% acrylamide gradient SDS-gels as described (Matsudiara & Burgess, 1978). The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes with the help of a semi-dry blotter (Khyse-Anderson, 1984). For Western blots, blotted proteins were visualised with 0.2% (v/v) Ponceau-S in 10% (v/v) acetic acid. After blocking with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, the blots were incubated with polyclonal rabbit antisera (diluted 1:1000) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). Immunodetection was carried out using BCIP/NBT as substrate as described by Harlow & Lane (1988) with the modification of dissolving the BCIP in 50% aqueous DMF instead of 100%. Alternatively the blotted proteins were detected using the Western-LightTM Chemiluminescent Detection System (Tropix, MA, USA) as described in the manufacturers' protocols. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p62 were raised as described (Buss & Stewart, 1995). Polyclonal antisera raised against Ran was a generous gift from Dirk Gorlich ¨ (Welcome Institute, Cambridge University, UK).

NTF2 Binding Sites

Figure 2. A, NTF2 binds to the N-terminal repeat containing region of p62. A bead binding assay as described in Figure 1 using expressed constructs corresponding to different p62 domains (see Figure 3A). Lanes 1 to 3 show p62-DC3, N terminus and RodD1 before loading into NTF2-Sepharose beads. As found previously (Buss & Stewart, 1995), the p62-DC3 construct invariably had a minor band at 36 kDa that derived from proteolysis during purification. To assess binding, 50 ml aliquots of NTF2-Sepharose slurry were incubated with 100 mg of each construct and the material remaining after washing was assayed by SDS-PAGE. The washed NTF2-Sepharose bound fractions are: p62-DC3 (lane 4), N terminus (lane 5) and RodD1 (lane 6). The results of the parallel BSA-Sepharose binding experiment are shown in the next three lanes: p62-DC3 (lane 7), N terminus (lane 8) and RodD1 (lane 9). RodD1 is bound in small non-specific quantities by both BSA and NTF2, whereas the N-terminal-containing constructs bind specifically to NTF2-Sepharose beads. B, NTF2 binds to the repeat containing region of Nsp1p. In a similar experiment constructs containing the xFxFG repeat region of Nsp1p (see Figure 3C) were tested for their ability to bind to NTF2- or BSA-Sepharose beads. Nsp1p-19R (lanes 1, 3 and 5) or Nsp1p-18R (lane 2, 4 and 6), were incubated with NTF2 (lanes 3­4) or BSA-Sepharose (lanes 5­6). The beads were washed exhaustively and the bound fractions examined by SDS-PAGE. Both Nsp1p constructs bound to NTF2-Sepharose and not to the control BSA-Sepharose.

attachment. As a positive control we verified that NTF2-Sepharose bound GDP-Ran (Figure 1A, lane 4) while BSA-Sepharose beads did not (Figure 1A, lane 6). In addition, NTF2-Sepharose was able to specifically remove native Ran from crude rat liver homogenate that contained an extremely complex mixture of proteins of which Ran represented only a small fraction that could not be identified by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1B, lane 1), although it could be detected in Western blots (Figure 1B, lane 4). After incubating beads with this homogenate and washing thoroughly, a distinct 25 kDa protein band together with several other minor bands was clearly visible specifically bound to NTF2-beads but not BSA-beads (Figure 1B, lanes 2 and 3), which Western blotting (Figure 1B, lanes 6 and 7) confirmed was Ran. No detectable Ran was bound to control BSA-Sepharose beads. Moreover, Western blots (Figure 1B, lanes 4 and 5) showed a corresponding decrease in the concentration of Ran in the rat liver homogenate after incubation with NTF2 beads. We also demonstrated that the NTF2-Ran binding was reversible. The construct we used expressed Ran with an N-terminal His-tag but, over time, the tag and first four residues of Ran were cleaved by endogenous proteases. Ran was able to bind to NTF2-Sepharose whether the His-tag was present or had cleaved, but in general all experiments used the untagged Ran variant. However we exploited the two different Ran constructs to show that its binding to NTF2 was reversible. As shown in Figure 4, untagged Ran bound to NTF2-Sepharose beads could be displaced

by tagged Ran. Since the larger Ran variant can displace the smaller protein, the result cannot have arisen as a result of proteolysis during the course of the experiment. These displacement studies therefore indicate that the Ran-NTF2 binding is reversible, and so unlikely to be due to non-specific protein interactions. Overall therefore, these experiments indicated that the NTF2-Sepharose was able to bind to GDP-Ran specifically and reversibly. Previous studies had indicated that p62 may bind to NTF2. Thus, using digitonin-permeabilised cell in in vitro transport assays, Paschal & Gerace (1995) showed that cytoplasm depleted by passage over p62-Sepharose beads was unable to support translocation, but that addition of NTF2 restored this function. However, although these data strongly suggest a NTF2-p62 interaction, the authors did not demonstrate binding directly and from these studies it was not certain whether NTF2 and p62 were interacting directly or whether, for example, NTF2 was binding to NTF2 via some additional protein. We used NTF2-Sepharose beads and bacterially expressed p62 to characterise these interactions in greater detail. Figure 1A shows that purified p62 (lane 1) bound to NTF2-Sepharose (lane 3) and not significantly to BSA-Sepharose (lane 5). We used the rat liver homogenate to demonstrate that native p62 could also be specifically isolated by NTF2 beads from a complex mixture of proteins. Although, in contrast to Ran, p62 bound to NTF2-Sepharose beads could not be detected by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1B, lane 2), it could be seen by Western blotting (lane 8),

NTF2 Binding Sites

521 repeats of p62 are separated by linkers of variable length from which charged residues are almost totally absent. By contrast, the Nsp1p linkers are all of identical length, and rich in charged residues (Figure 3). We expressed two constructs containing the central repeat region of Nsp1p, namely Nsp1p-19R and Nsp1p-18R (Figure 3C), and tested the ability of these constructs to interact with rat NTF2. As shown in Figure 2B, both Nsp1p constructs bound to NTF2-Sepharose and did not bind to control BSA-Sepharose. Therefore both Nsp1p and p62 N-terminal xFxFG repeat domains bind to NTF2, despite the dissimilarity of their linker regions. This indicates that NTF2 binds to the xFxFG core in the nucleoporin repeats rather than to the linker regions. We next investigated the extent to which the interaction sites for the nucleoporin repeats and Ran on NTF2 overlapped. Proteins that bind to the same or overlapping sites on NTF2 should compete for binding whereas proteins that bind to separate, non-overlapping sites should bind independently of one another. We therefore tested whether Ran, Nsp1p-18R and p62 could displace one another from NTF2-beads. When we incubated NTF2Sepharose beads with Ran and Nsp1p-18R together, both proteins bound (Figure 4, lane 1). However, this dual binding could have resulted either from these proteins binding to different sites or from each partially occupying the same site. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the extent to which one protein influenced the exchange of the other when bound to NTF2. Thus, when beads to which both untagged Ran and Nsp1p-18R were bound were subsequently incubated with His-tagged Ran, only the untagged Ran was displaced (Figure 4, lane 3), which indicated that although Ran was able to compete with itself under these assay conditions, it was not able to compete with Nsp1p-18R for NTF2-binding. By contrast, when NTF2 beads, to which both Ran and Nsp1p-18R were bound, were incubated with the p62 N terminus as competitor, Nsp1p-18R was displaced completely, whereas Ran remained bound (Figure 4, lane 2). Overall these results indicated that the xFxFG domain of p62 bound to the same site on NTF2 as the xFxFG repeats of Nsp1p and that Ran bound to a different site on NTF2, which did not overlap significantly the xFxFG nucleoporin-binding site. A range of experiments have implicated p62 (and its associated p58, p54 and p45 nucleoporins) in nuclear protein import (Finlay et al., 1991). It has been proposed that, since p62 is located close to the NPC axis on both its nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic faces (Guan et al., 1995), it could function to target NTF2 to the vicinity of the central transporter channel (Paschal & Gerace, 1995). By interacting with Ran, NTF2 could also target this molecule to the central region of the NPC and so ensure the presence of two important components of the translocation machinery at the cytoplasmic aperture of the transport channel. In this context, it

whereas control BSA-Sepharose beads were negative (lane 9). The lower quantity of native p62 bound to NTF2-Sepharose beads probably reflected the lower abundance of p62 relative to Ran in the crude homogenate (p62 is primarily a constituent of the nuclear envelope and so should have been largely removed by high-speed centrifugation of the homogenate) and indeed we were unable to detect p62 in the homogenate by Western blotting. Overall these results indicated that p62 binds specifically to NTF2 and that the interaction was direct and does not require additional factors. In addition, although native p62 is glycosylated (Lubas et al., 1995; Starr et al., 1990), the ability of recombinant proteins to interact (this study and Paschal & Gerace, 1995) indicated that sugar moieties do not form a crucial part of the NTF2-p62 binding site. We tested a range of p62 truncation constructs (see Figure 2A) in the Sepharose bead assay to determine which region of p62 interacted with NTF2. The p62 molecule is constructed from an a-helical coiled-coil rod domain and an N-terminal domain based on a series of degenerate xFxFG repeats (see Figure 3). We initially experienced some technical difficulties that derived from the unfavourable solubility properties of some of the p62 domain constructs. There was considerable non-specific binding to BSA when the p62 constructs were poorly soluble or tended to polymerise and/or precipitate in solution (Buss et al., 1994). However, we found that the non-specific binding could be suppressed by working at 4°C in 50 mM imidazole (pH 7.0), and by pre-incubating p62 constructs with BSA beads to remove aggregated or unfolded protein before incubation with either NTF2- or control BSA-Sepharose beads. Using this protocol the residual background binding of p62 constructs to BSASepharose beads was acceptably low (Figure 2A). By contrast, significant amounts of p62-DC3 and N-terminal domain bound specifically to NTF2 beads (Figure 2A, lanes 4 and 5), whereas the low level of binding of RodD1 to NTF2-Sepharose under these conditions was comparable to that to BSA-Sepharose and was probably non-specific (Figure 2A, lanes 6 and 9). NTF2 therefore binds primarily to the N-terminal xFxFG repeat containing region of p62, which would be consistent with the work of Paschal & Gerace (1995), who showed that, although NTF2 can be depleted from cytosol with whole p62, it is not removed by the C-terminal coiled-coil region of p62. To test if other xFxFG repeats might also bind to NTF2, we used constructs from the yeast nucleoporin Nsp1p, which has been suggested to be the homologue of p62 (Carmo-Fonseca et al., 1991). Nsp1p contains a region of 22 unusually regular xFxFG repeats, followed by a putative a-helical coiled-coil (Figure 3C, D), and therefore has a structural organisation similar to p62 (Figure 3A). However the detailed nature of the xFxFG repeat region varies considerably from p62. The 15 xFxFG

Figure 3. Schematic representation of the different p62 (A, B) and Nsp1p (C, D) constructs. The p62 N-terminal xFxFG-repeat containing domain is joined to the a-helical coiled-coil C-terminal rod domain by a threonine-rich linker (A). The p62-DC3 and the N-terminal constructs (residues 1 to 428, and residues 1 to 194, respectively) contain the nucleoporin repeating domain, but only p62-DC3 also reaches into the coiled-coil domain. The RodD1 construct (residues 331 to 525) corresponds to the coiled-coil region. Both RodD1 and p62-DC3 have a small deletion from the C terminus introduced to reduce aggregation in solution (see Buss et al., 1994). The 15 p62 repeats (residues 1 to 319) are of variable length (Starr et al., 1990), and have only one charged residue (B). The underlined proline (residue 194) is the C-terminal residue of the p62 N terminus construct. In Nsp1p (C) the xFxFG-repeat region is followed by a putative coiled-coil at the C terminus (Nehrbass et al., 1990). The Nsp1p-19R and Nsp1p-18R constructs we employed contained 19 and 18 repeats, respectively. The 22 Nsp1p repeats (residues 178 to 609) are highly conserved; indeed repeats 7 to 10 are identical to 12 to 15 (D). There is a large proportion of charged residues. The fully underlined amino acids indicate the N and C termini of Nsp1p-19R, the N terminus of which has an additional vector-coded sequence MGSSR, and the C terminus is extended with CRHASLGL. The double underlined amino acids indicate the N and C termini of Nsp1p-18R, although the N terminus has an initiating methionine residue.

is important that Ran and the p62 N terminus bind to different sites on NTF2. This would enable NTF2 to bind p62 and Ran simultaneously and so enable NTF2 to bridge between them and so ensure that Ran was positioned appropriately. The interaction of NTF2 with both the N terminus of p62 and the xFxFG region of Nsp1p indicates that the phenylalanine-rich core regions of these sequence motifs are important for the interaction. As illustrated in Figure 3, the intervening hydrophilic linker regions of the p62 and Nsp1p sequences are quite different. Those from p62 are highly degenerate and vary in both sequence and length. Moreover, the p62 linkers are remarkable for the absence of changed residues within them. By contrast both the length and sequence of Nsp1p repeats are strongly conserved and they contain a substantial proportion of charged residues. In this

context it is interesting to note that the three-dimensional structure of NTF2 determined by X-ray crystallography (Bullock et al., 1996) indicates that the molecule has a prominent hydrophobic cavity which might form a docking site for the two phenylalanine residues of the xFxFG core. The interaction of NTF2 with the repeat regions of p62 and Nsp1p raises the possibility that NTF2 might also interact with other nucleoporins containing this sequence motif and indeed Nehrbass & Blobel (1996) have indicated that yeast NTF2 interacts with yeast Nup36, which contains five xFxFG repeats, and with a range of other yeast nucleoporins. A considerable number of nucleoporins have been shown to have the xFxFG motif (see Rout & Wente, 1994) and, significantly, many of these proteins have also been implicated in interactions involving the importin subunits that have been proposed to

NTF2 Binding Sites

523 precise role of the Ran GTPase has not been defined in all of these interactions, one attractive hypothesis is that it is able to modulate the attachment and/or detachment of the importin-substrate complex to the xFxFG-containing nucleoporins. In this context, the potential of NTF2s also interacting with these nucleoporins and either targeting Ran to them or modulating the nucleotide state of Ran is certainly attractive. The interaction between Ran and NTF2 is modulated by the nucleotide state of Ran (Paschal et al., 1996; Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996) and this could be one way in which nucleotide hydrolysis is linked, albeit indirectly, to nuclear protein import. In summary, we have provided direct evidence for the interaction between NTF2 and both Ran and nucleosporins p62 and Nsp1p in vitro. We have demonstrated that Ran and p62 bind to different sites on NTF2 and that NTF2 appears to interact primarily with the phenylalanine-rich cores of nucleoporin repeating sequence motifs. This interaction may function to help target the Ran GTPase to the repeat-containing nucleoporins that have been proposed to line the channel of NPCs and to provide a sequence of docking sites for importinsubstrate complexes as they are translocated into the nucleus.

Figure 4. Competition experiments show GDP-Ran and xFxFG repeats bind to different sites on NTF2. Ran lacking the His-Tag and Nsp1p-18R were incubated with NTF2-Sepharose beads as described in the legend to Figure 1, and after one hour of incubation the beads were washed thoroughly and divided into aliquots containing 50 ml of bead slurry. One aliquot was incubated with no competitor (lane 1), a second was incubated with 200 mg (an approximately fivefold molar excess) of p62 N terminus (lane 2) and the third was incubated with 200 mg (an approximately fivefold molar excess) of His-tagged Ran (lane 3). Each was incubated for 30 minutes, washed to remove unbound material and then re-incubated with a further 200 mg of competitor protein for a further 30 minutes to maximise the chance of detecting displacement of the protein bound initially. The beads were then thoroughly washed and examined by SDS-PAGE. The p62 N terminus construct can clearly displace the Nsp1p xFxFG repeats but not Ran (lane 2), and Ran displace itself but not Nsp1p (lane 3). The failure of Ran to displace Nsp1p and of the p62 N terminus to displace Ran indicated that the binding sites for Ran and the p62 N terminus were distinct.

be intimately associated with the passage of material through the NPC. Importin-b, Ran and NTF2 have all been suggested to interact with nucleoporins (e.g. see Gorlich et al., 1995; Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Wu ¨ et al., 1995; Yokoyama et al., 1995; Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996). This encourages the view that translocation through the nuclear pore involves a series of association and dissociations between the transport factors and nucleoporins (Moroianu et al., 1995; Radu et al., 1995; Rexach & Blobel, 1995). Such a proposal is certainly consistent with the observation of nucleoplasmin-coated gold particles being attached to multiple sites during transport (Feldherr et al., 1984; Newmeyer & Forbes, 1988; Richardson et al., 1988) and also to a number of different morphological components of NPCs in disrupted preparations (Stewart et al., 1990).
