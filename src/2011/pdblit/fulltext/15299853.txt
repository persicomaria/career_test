TAHIROV, MISAKI, MEYER, CUSANOVICH, HIGUCHI AND YASUOKA structure determination (Tahirov et al., 1997) appears to differ from RCCP-SL used here in one residue only. The Asp90 in RCCP-SL is substituted for Glu90 in RCCPM110. In the current report, we present the crystallization, three-dimensional structure determination and the refined crystal structure of RCCP-SL, in which the molecular interaction differs markedly from that of RCCP-M 110.

2. Experimental
2.1. Crystallization and data collection
Macromolecular crystallization reagent kits, 'Crystal Screen' and 'Crystal Screen II', purchased from Hampton Research, were used for screening crystallization conditions. The procedure was the same as that suggested by Jancarik & Kim (1991). RCCP-SL crystals were grown in 3 d as extremely thin parallelepiped plates, with dimensions 0.6 x 0.25 x 0.004 mm, by the sittingdrop vapor-diffusion method. Drops were composed of a mixture of 5 lal of 10 mg ml-~ protein solution and 5 pl of a reservoir solution; they were equilibrated against 500 lal of reservoir solution at room temperature. The reservoir solution was prepared by mixing equal amounts of 18% PEG 8000 as precipitant, 0.2 M zinc acetate as salt and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5. These conditions were derived considering the fact that RCCPSL does not crystallize under the same conditions as RCCP-M110 (Higuchi et al., 1996; Tahirov et al., 1997). Furthermore, RCCP-M110 does not crystallize under the conditions reported here for crystallization of RCCP-SL. The RCCP-SL crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P2~, with unit-cell dimensions a-- 39.68, b = 46.85, c = 40.75 A, 13 = 110.94 c. The solvent content calculated using the Matthews (1968) equation suggests that there are two 14 kDa molecules in the unit cell with an approximate water content of 51%. Diffraction patterns were recorded on Fuji imaging plates with a Weissenberg camera for protein crystallography installed on BL-6A at the Photon Factory of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics in Tsukuba (Sakabe, 1991). The wavelength of the synchrotron radiation source was 1.0 A. Crystals diffracted to at least 2.1 A resolution and only one crystal was used to collect the complete data set. The recorded data were read by a BA-100 system and processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1986). A total of 27 125 reflections in the resolution range 30-2.1 were merged to give 6988 independent intensities with an Rmerge value of 0.08, data completeness of 85.2% and (I/a(1)) = 16.0. The last three values were 0.19, 66.4% and 3.9, respectively, in the last resolution shell from 2.18 to 2.1/k. 2.2. Structure solution and refinement The atomic coordinates of crystal form A of RCCPM l l 0 (accession number 1CPQ in the Brookhaven

Protein Data Bank) were used as a search model (Tahirov et al., 1997). The molecular replacement method based on Patterson correlation (PC) refinement (Briinger, 1990a) gave a clear solution in the resolution range 15-4 A, with a PC coefficient of 0.39 for the first peak of the cross-rotation function; the PC coefficient for the highest background peak was 0.15. The best solution corresponds to a set of rotation angles 0~ = 177.4, 02 -- 98 and 03 = 263.8 °. The translation search for the same resolution data also gave a clear solution with the fractional coordinates at x = 0.275, y = 0, z = 0.561, and a correlation coefficient of 0.62 (0.48 for the next peak and a value of cr = 0.04). Structure refinements by rigid-body, conjugate-gradient minimization, simulated-annealing and B-factor refinement protocols of the X-PLOR program package (Briinger, 1990b), with the parameters set at parhcsdx.pro (Engh & Huber, 1991), reduced the crystallographic R factor from 39.8 to 23.2% in the resolution range 6.0-2.1 A. ( 2 F o - F~) and ( F o - Fc) Fourier maps and omit maps clearly indicated the substitution of Glu90 (in RCCP-M110) for Asp90, as

expected from the primary structure of RCCP-SL (Ambler, personal communication). At this stage, 47 water molecules were located. An additional six peaks had unacceptable protein-water distances of approximately 2.05 A and high density values on the electrondensity maps. Two of them, especially, had values comparable to that of Fe. These six peaks, in addition to a peak for heme Fe, appeared in the anomalous difference Fourier map calculated from 4911 Friedel pairs at 2.2 A resolution, with phases obtained from the coordinates of the refined molecule, indicating the presence of heavy atoms at these positions rather than water. Considering the crystallization reagents, two types of heavy atom are possible: Zn or As. The binding geometry suggests the presence of Zn ions. The positions and the occupancies of the Zn ions were also refined. Finally, the overall and individual displacement parameters were refined again. The final crystallographic R value for 962 protein atoms, six Zn atoms and 47 water O atoms was 18.4% for 6440 reflections with F > 2o'(F) in the resolution shell from 6 to 2.1 A, which corresponds to 81.5% of all possible reflections. The resulting rootmean-square (r.m.s.) deviations from standard values for bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles and improper angles are 0.009 ,&, 1.34, 20.02 and 1.51°, respectively. The r.m.s. B values for protein atoms, Zn ions and water O atoms are 21.1, 23.6 and 36.0A 2, respectively. A Ramachandran plot and a plot of displacement parameter versus residue number are shown in Fig. 1. The atomic coordinates of the refined structure have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977; Abola, Bernstein, Bryant, Koetzle & Weng, 1987).t

RCCP-M110 was crystallized in two different crystal forms, A and B. In both forms, the molecules appear to be dimers and their dimer structures are very similar to each other (Tahirov et al., 1997). However, RCCP appears to exist as an equilibrium mixture of monomers and dimers in solution (Cusanovich, 1971). Although a comparison of RCCP-Mll0 and RCCP-SL shows only a single amino acid substitution and that their molecular folds (Fig. 2a) are identical, the association of molecules in the current crystal form of RCCP-SL is totally different from that in RCCP-M110. RCCP-SL crystallized as a linear association of monomers, extended along the c axis (Fig. 2b), rather than as dimers. There are some intermolecular salt bridges, water-mediated hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts in the crystal that are different from those in the RCCP-Mll0 structure (Table 1). However, we

believe that the change in architecture is caused by the presence of Zn ions, as described below. The overall structures of RCCP-M110 and RCCP-SL molecules are similar; they can be superimposed at the Cot positions of 129 residues and at the heme Fe-atom positions with an r.m.s, deviation of 0.39A. The deviation of Cot positions versus residue number is plotted in Fig. 3. The difference between RCCP-M110 and RCCP-SL is larger at the N- and C-terminal ends. This is not unexpected, since the B-value distributions in RCCP-SL (Fig. l b), as well as in two crystal forms of RCCP-M110 (Tahirov et al., 1997) and in n-butylisocyanide-bound RCCP-Mll0 (Tahirov et al., 1997), indicate that their terminal regions are highly flexible or disordered. The only difference in primary structure between RCCP-M110 and RCCP-SL is at position 90. In R C C P M ll0, Glu90 is far from the dimer interface and, consequently, it is inappropriate to expect that the substitution of Glu90 for Asp90 in RCCP-SL changes the dimer architecture or drives dimer dissociation. However, such a substitution seems to influence dramatically the crystallization process. Crystals of RCCP-SL do not grow under the conditions used for crystallization of the two polymorphs of RCCP-M110. Comparison of the RCCP-M110 and RCCP-SL structures (Fig. 4) shows that the Glu90 to Asp90 substitution affects only the position of the adjacent side chain, Lys86. In RCCP-M110, the position of the Lys86 side chain is stabilized by a salt bridge between Lys86 NZ and Glu90 OE1. In addition, a weaker salt bridge is formed between Lys86 NZ and G l u 5 0 E 2 of the neighboring molecule (Fig. 4). The RCCP-SL structure shows that both salt bridges are disrupted by the Glu90 to Asp90 substitution, and both seem essential for stabilizing the crystal structure of RCCP-M110. In addition to the fact that crystals of RCCP-SL do not grow under the conditions used for crystallization of two polymorphs of RCCP-M110 (as mentioned above), crystals of R C C P M I10 do not grow under the conditions used for crystallization of RCCP-SL. However, inspection of the crystal structure of RCCP-SL shows that the space

TAHIROV, MISAKI, MEYER, CUSANOVICH, HIGUCHI AND YASUOKA around the Asp90 and Lys86 side chains is large enough to accommodate the Asp90 to Glu90 substitution and the associated conformational changes of the Lys86 side chain without detectable influence on the surrounding molecules. One possibility why the crystals of RCCPM l l 0 do not grow under the conditions used for crystallization of RCCP-SL is that the Glu90 side chain might bind Zn ions. The results also suggest that the dimer observed in RCCP-M110 is stabilized by crystal packing and may not be the same as the dimer that is present in solution. Thus, the forthcoming results of an NMR study of the structure in solution should be informative (Caffrey, Simon'e, Brutscher, Cusanovich & Marion, 1995). The six peaks on electron-density maps were assigned to Zn ions. The overall locations relative to the RCCP-SL

molecule are shown in Fig. 2. The configuration about Znl is tetrahedral (Fig. 5). This position is fully occupied and the Zn is located between two molecules related by a translation along the c axis. Znl binds to both molecules, to OD2 of Asp32 and OEI of Glu34 from one molecule, and to OD2 of Asp124 from another molecule. The average Zn--O distance is 2.05/k. The distance to the fourth coordination position, occupied by heavy atom 2, is 3.17 ~. We assigned this heavy atom to Zn with an occupancy of 0.35. However, a disordered cacodylate ion at the Zn2 position cannot be ruled out. Zn4 has an occupancy 0.45 and binds to O2A of the heme propionate and OE2 of Glull with a Zn--O distance of 2.06/k. The binding of Zn4 results in breakage of a salt bridge between NZ of Lys 15 and O 1A of the heme propionate and in reorientation of the Glul 1 side chain as

In RCCP-M110, the His89 side chain is disordered and occupies two positions. However, no disorder was observed for His89 in RCCPSL. Only a few interactions across the dimer interface were observed in the RCCP-M110 structure. These include a hydrophobic interaction between Va138 and Ile46, two salt bridges between the side chains of Glu39 and Lys42, and between Glu34 and Thr49, and their symmetryrelated pairs, plus some water-mediated hydrogen bonds. In RCCP-SL, the side chain of Glu34 binds a Zn ion (Znl) and changes conformation relative to that in RCCP-M110, thus leading to breakage of the hydrogen bond across what would have been the dimer interface.

From these observations, we can conclude that the molecules in the dimer are not strongly associated in RCCP-SL and that dissociation in the crystal is most probably caused by Znl binding. The comparison of RCCP-M110 and RCCP-SL molecules (Fig. 7) indicates that the side chains of residues other than Glu34, the side chains of which are involved in molecule association in the dimer structure of RCCP-MI10, also undergo conformational changes upon dimer dissociation or Znmediated interaction. In particular, changes in conformation of the side chains of Va138, Lys42 and Lys45 are apparent. In conclusion, we have made two important observations: that transition metal ions can have profound effects on protein structure through alteration of molecule interactions, and that in RCCP, the dimer interaction is not very strong. Most cytochromes c' exist as dimers in solution and are difficult to dissociate because of the strong interaction between molecules. In some cases, ligand binding to the heme can lead to dimer dissociation, although not in RCCP. On the other hand, we have now shown that Zn binding at six different locations in RCCP can lead to dimer dissociation.
