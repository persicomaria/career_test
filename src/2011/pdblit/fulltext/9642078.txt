Abstract Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mediates the proliferation, differentiation and activation of cells in the granulocytic lineage. However, knowledge about the specific signaling pathways utilized by the G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R) upon ligand binding remains limited. In this report, we show rapid phosphorylation of Shc upon stimulation of NFS-60 cells with G-CSF, and inducible association of Shc and Grb2 with the G-CSF-R in these cells. Using a tyrosine-phosphorylated GST^G-CSF-R fusion we demonstrate that Shc, Grb2 and SHP-2 directly bind the receptor via their respective SH2 domains, suggesting multiple routes of MAPK activation from the G-CSF-R are possible. In addition, we have identified an unknown p40 molecule which is associated with the G-CSF-R transiently following G-CSF stimulation, and a constitutivelyassociated p37 molecule. ﬂ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulates the proliferation, di°erentiation and functional activation of cells of the granulocyte lineage [1]. G-CSF also causes the mobilization of early precursor cells from the marrow [2], which has lead to its widespread clinical application in the reconstitution of hematopoietic cells in patients following bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy [3]. The G-CSF receptor, G-CSF-R, is a homo-oligomer of a single-chain molecule, which resembles the common L subunit of the IL-3, GM-CSF and IL-5 receptors

[4], all of which are members of the cytokine receptor family [5]. Like other family members, the G-CSF-R lacks an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins following ligand binding has been reported, including p80c¿Rel [6], p55Lyn and p72Syk [7], and JAKs 1 and 2 [8]. Receptor phosphorylation is believed to be carried out by one or more kinases, such as the JAK kinases, JAK1, JAK2 or Tyk2 [8^12], or the Src kinase, p55Lyn [7]. Downstream pathways include p21ras , Raf-1, and MAPK [10,13^15], and the transcription factors p80c¿Rel [6], and STATs 1, 3 and 5A [9,12,14], with some of these pathways requiring particular regions of the receptor [14,16]. However, the understanding of G-CSF signal transduction lags signi¢cantly behind that of other receptor systems. The Shc proteins have been shown to interact with

various growth factor receptors, including the EGF receptor, and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as v-Src [17,18]. Receptor activation has been shown to lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, and interaction with a Grb2/Sos complex to activate p21ras and ultimately MAPK [19,20]. In addition, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 can associate with Grb2 to simulate the Ras/MAPK pathway [21^23]. Since we and others have observed G-CSF-mediated activation of p21ras , Raf-1 and MAPK [10,13^15], we set out to analyze the involvement of Shc, Grb2 and SHP-2 in signaling from the murine G-CSF-R. Our studies showed association of Shc, Grb2 and SHP-2 to the tyrosine-phosphorylated G-CSF-R cytoplasmic domain, via direct binding through their respective SH2 domains, suggesting multiple routes of MAPK activation are possible. In addition, we sought to examine whether other cellular proteins might interact with the G-CSF-R. This revealed inducible binding of a p40 molecule, and constitutive association of a p37 molecule with the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF-R. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Cells and culture conditions NFS-60 cells are a myeloid-derived, G-CSF/IL3-dependent cell line [24] obtained from Dr. J. Ihle (St. Jude's Hospital, Memphis, TN). Unless otherwise speci¢ed, these were grown in DMEM containing 2 mM glutamine, 10% (v/v) FBS and 10 ng/ml recombinant human G-CSF (Amgen, Melbourne, Australia) at 37≥C in 5% CO2 , as described [25]. Cells were subsequently washed in DMEM and then incubated in DMEM +10% FBS without growth factor for 14 h before use to render them quiescent. For 35 S labelling experiments, cells were rendered quiescent as described above for 12 h, then incubated for a further 2 h in methionine- and serum-free media supplemented with 1 mCi Tran35 -label (ICN-Flow, Sydney, Australia) per 107 cells, before stimulation. 2.2. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis Quiescent and growth-factor-treated cells were lysed in lysis bu°er (10 mM Tris^HCl pH 7.2, con-

taining 1% (v/v) NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 70 IU/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mM Pefabloc, 10Wg/ml leupeptin, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA and 200 WM orthovanadate) and clari¢ed by centrifugation at 12 000Ug for 15 min. Lysates (50 Wg) were incubated with 2 Wg of glutathione Sepharose-immobilized fusion protein, or 1 Wg of rabbit polyclonal anti-Grb2, anti-Shc (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-GCSF-R (this study), overnight at 4≥C. For immunoprecipitations, the immune complexes were collected by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) for a further 30 min. The precipitates were washed three times in lysis bu°er, electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to Hybond-C membranes. Membranes were blocked in 3% (w/v) BSA, 1% (w/v) ovalbumin in PBS (BOP bu°er), and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Shc, anti-G-CSF-R, or monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate) in BOP bu°er for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed extensively in TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, and bound antibodies visualized with HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit, or rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako, La Jolla, CA), using the ECL system (Amersham) and following the manufacturer's instructions. 2.3. Plasmids, fusion proteins, and antibodies A DNA fragment corresponding to the region coding for the cytoplasmic domain of the murine G-CSF receptor (aa 632^812) was cloned into pGEX2TK (Pharmacia), to generate a plasmid designated p2TK-GR. For antibody production, this plasmid was transformed into XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Exponentially growing cultures were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG (isopropyl L-Dthiogalactopyranoside) for 4 h at 37≥C. The cells were then washed in TBS and lysed by sonication in TEND (TBS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40). The lysate was centrifuged at 12 000Ug for 20 min and incubated with glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (AMRAD, Melbourne, Australia) for 30 min. The beads were washed extensively with TEND, before elution of the puri¢ed fusion protein (GST^GCSF-R) with 25 mM Glutathione in TE. This was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits according to standard protocols. The resultant antisera was shown to be speci¢c due to its ability to recog-

nize the three forms of the murine G-CSF-R expressed in NFS-60 cells [26] or FDCP-1 cells transfected with the murine G-CSF-R, with no signal observed in parental FDCP-1 cells (A.C. Ward and X.F. Csar, unpublished). For the production of tyrosine-phosphorylated G-CSF-R cytoplasmic domain, plasmid p2TK-GR was introduced into the Escherichia coli strain TKX1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contains an inducible tyrosine kinase. Fusion protein was produced as described above, except a second induction was carried out in TK induction media for 2 h at 30≥C, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The puri¢ed protein was 32 P-labelled with heart muscle kinase and cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST tag, as described previously [27,28]. In addition, the C-terminus of SHP-2 (aa 526^593) was cloned into pET-15b (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) and introduced into the E. coli strain TKB1 (Stratagene). Expression of tyrosine phosphorylated SHP-2 C-terminus was achieved as described above, with the protein puri¢ed on NiNTA-Agarose resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and labeled as above. 2.4. Far Western blot analysis GST fusions of the following SH2 domain containing molecules were puri¢ed as described above: Grb2 (SH3^SH2^SH3, aa 1^217), Grb2(m) (SH3^ SH2mutant^SH3, aa 1^217), Shc (SH2, aa 366^ 473), CrkL (SH2, aa 10^104), Grb14 (SH2, aa 426^ 540), Src (SH2, aa 145^248), and SHP-2(n+c) (SH2SH2, aa 1^215). These were then electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels [29], and electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham, Sydney, Australia). The ¢lters were then processed through a denaturation^renaturation cycle [30] and probed with 32 P-labelled, tyrosine-phosphorylated GCSF-R cytoplasmic domain or SHP-2 C-terminus, as described [28]. 3. Results and discussion Shc is an SH2-containing signaling protein with no apparent catalytic function, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated following activation of a diverse range of

receptors. Phosphorylated Shc can then bind Grb2/ Sos complexes to activate p21ras , Raf-1 and the MAPK pathway [20]. In addition, Grb2 can lead to activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway via association with SHP-2 [21^23]. We and others have observed G-CSF-mediated activation of p21ras , Raf-1 and the ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms of MAPK [10,13^15]. Therefore, we sought to investigate a possible role for Shc and Grb2 in G-CSF signaling. We ¢rst immunoprecipitated Shc from NFS-60 lysates following G-CSF stimulation (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G-10 antibodies indicated tyrosine-phosphorylation of the p52 isoform of Shc in response to G-CSF. Importantly, analysis with anti-G-CSF-R antiserum showed, in addition, the inducible association of Shc with the G-CSF-R. The two bands represent di°erent glycosylated isoforms of the G-CSF-R previously reported in these cells [26]. Re-probing with anti-Shc antiserum con¢rmed equal loading of Shc in these experiments. Immunoprecipitation with Grb2, and Western blot analysis with anti-G-CSF-R antiserum, showed similar inducible association of Grb2 with the GCSF-R (Fig. 2). Re-probing with anti-Grb2 con¢rmed equal loading (data not shown). Since the kinetics of Shc and Grb2 association were similar to those for G-CSF-R tyrosine phos-

phorylation in these cells (A.C. Ward and X.F. Csar, unpublished), we analyzed whether their association with the receptor was direct and dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. To achieve this we produced a GST-fusion with the cytoplasmic domain of the murine G-CSF-R in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form. Multiple species were observed which were reactive with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G-10 antibodies, indicating the protein was phosphorylated at multiple sites (data not shown). The tyrosine phosphorylated GST^G-CSF-R was 32 P-labelled using heart muscle kinase, cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST, and used in an in vitro binding assay on various GST^SH2 domain fusions, which had been immobilized on nitrocellulose. The receptor was found to bind speci¢cally to GST^Shc(SH2) and GST^ Grb2(SH3^SH2^SH3), but not to a GST^Grb2 which contains a mutant SH2 domain, or to fusions of GST with the SH2 domains of CrkL, v-Src, or Grb14 (Fig. 3). This binding was not competed out by a forty-fold excess of unlabelled non-tyrosine phosphorylated receptor (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that both Shc and Grb2 can bind directly to the activated G-CSF-R via their respective

SH2 domains, implicating these molecules in G-CSF signal transduction. Interestingly, these molecules may compete for the same phosphorylated tyrosine residue of the receptor, Y763 (Table 1), since its sequence context matches the consensus binding site for the SH2 domains of both Shc (pY-I/E/Y-X-I/L/ M) and Grb2 (pY-bulky amino acid-N) [31]. Since Grb2/SHP-2 complexes have been reported in response to G-CSF stimulation [16], we also examined whether SHP-2 might also interact directly with the G-CSF-R. Far Western analysis showed speci¢c interaction between SHP-2 SH2 domains and tyrosine-phosphorylated G-CSF-R cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 4). This possibly occurs at multiple sites, since each of the cytoplasmic tyrosines of the murine G-CSF-R (Table 1) shows some homology to the consensus SHP-2 SH2 binding site (Y^I/V^X^V/ I/L/P) [32]. Other studies have shown that Grb2/ SHP-2 complexes are the result of interaction of the Grb2 SH2 domain with phosphorylated tyrosines in the SHP-2 C-terminus [33]. We used Far Western analysis to con¢rm that, from a range of signaling molecules, only Grb2 interacted with tyrosine-phos-

This result was con¢rmed in several independent experiments.

GST-fusions of various SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules were separated on duplicate SDS-PAGE gels and either stained with Coomassie or transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with 32 P-labeled, tyrosine-phosphorylated G-CSF-R cytoplasmic domain (G-CSF-R pY) or SHP-2 C-terminus (SHP-2 pY), as indicated.

phorylated SHP-2 C-terminus (Fig. 4), which contains two sites, pY542 -T-N and pY580 -E-N, that also match the Grb2 SH2 consensus. Thus, it appears that SHP-2 can dock to the G-CSF-R via its SH2 domains, and thereby generate additional Grb2 docking site(s) in the G-CSF-R complex. The direct binding and tyrosine-phosphorylation of Shc proteins we have shown in NFS-60 cells suggests a classical Shc/Grb2/Sos/Ras route of MAPK activation occurs in response to G-CSF. This is supported by our previous studies showing activation of Ras, Raf-1 and ERK in these cells, with kinetics consistent with that of Shc activation shown here [15], as well as data from Ba/F3 cells showing GCSF activation of Shc/Grb2 complexes [16], presumably by binding of the Grb2 SH2 domain to tyrosine 317 of Shc [20]. In addition, Grb2 can utilize SHP-2 as an adapter protein to provide an alternate mechanism of MAPK stimulation, or bind directly to the receptor itself. The clear dissection of the role played by Grb2 in these alternate complexes in mediating G-CSF responses remains an important area for study. To further investigate G-CSF-R-mediated signal transduction in NFS-60 cells, we also sought to examine whether other cellular proteins might interact with the G-CSF-R. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated the G-CSF-R from 35 P-labelled lysates from NFS-60 cells, before or after stimulation with G-

CSF. Analysis of the bound cellular proteins by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed a p37 molecule constitutively-associated with the receptor, and a p40 molecule associated transiently with the receptor with a consistent peak at 5 min (Fig. 5A). To explore these interactions further, we also used the GST^G-CSF-R fusion protein as an a§nity tag on similarly-labeled lysates to examine those molecules which are capable of directly binding to the receptor (Fig. 5B). The p37 was not observed, indicating that it either binds indirectly, or interacts with the extracellular domain of the receptor. However, this analysis again revealed a p40 molecule which bound transiently and directly with the G-CSF-R. In this case, the peak binding was consistently observed 2 min after stimulation, suggesting this molecule may dock ¢rst to the receptor directly, then to another component present in the G-CSF-R complex. This p40 molecule, therefore, represents an interesting candidate for puri¢cation and microsequence analysis, as a ¢rst step in determining its role in signaling via the G-CSF-R in these cells.
