Structure-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors are described. In an effort to enhance interactions with protease backbone atoms, we have incorporated stereochemically defined methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and methyl oxazolidinone as the P1-ligands. These ligands are designed to interact with Gly-27 carbonyl and Arg-8 side chain in the S1-subsite of the HIV protease. We have investigated the potential of these ligands in combination with our previously developed bistetrahydrofuran (bis-THF) and cyclopentanyltetrahydrofuran (Cp-THF) as the P2-ligands. Inhibitor 19b with a (R)-aminomethyl-2-pyrrolidinone and a Cp-THF was shown to be the most potent compound. This inhibitor maintained near full potency against multi-PI-resistant clinical HIV-1 variants. A high resolution protein-ligand X-ray crystal structure of 19b-bound HIV-1 protease revealed that the P1-pyrrolidinone heterocycle and the P2-Cp-ligand are involved in several critical interactions with the backbone atoms in the S1 and S2 subsites of HIV-1 protease.
Introduction Advances in the treatment of HIVa/AIDS with HIV-1 protease inhibitors in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been widely documented.1 The combination therapy, also known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), blocks critical viral replication at two different stages of the replication cycle.2 The HAART regimens have resulted in dramatic reduction of blood plasma viral load levels, increased CD4+ lymphocyte counts, and improved life expectancy and significantly reduced HIV/AIDS-related mortality in the developed world.3 Despite these important advances, effective long-term suppression of HIV infection with HAART regimens is a complex issue in medicine for a number of reasons. These include drug side effects, poor penetration into protected HIV reservoir sites, poor oral bioavailability, and interactions between drugs.4 Perhaps one of the most daunting problems in future management of HIV is the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants and the transmission of these viral strains.5,6 Thus, development of antiretroviral therapy with broad-spectrum activity and minimal drug side effects is critical for an effective management of current and future HIV/AIDS treatment. We recently reported the design and development of a number of exceedingly potent nonpeptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) 1-3 (Figure 1).7-9 One of those PIs is darunavir (1, TMC The PDB accession code for 19b-bound HIV-1 protease X-ray structure is 3H5B. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

protease, we have shown that these PIs were engaged in extensive hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone atoms throughout the active site cavity from the S2 to S2 regions.9,15 To further enhance "backbone binding" interactions, we became interested in designing an appropriately functionalized P1-ligand that could interact with the backbone atoms, particularly with the Gly-27 and Arg-8 in the S1-subsite. This enhancement of "backbone binding" interaction may lead to inhibitors with improved drug-resistance profiles. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors that incorporated structurebased designed stereochemically defined lactam and oxazolidinone derivatives as the P1-ligands in combination with the bis-THF or Cp-THF as the P2-ligands. Inhibitor 19b incorporating a (R)-5-aminomethyl-2-pyrrolidinone as the P1-ligand and Cp-THF as the P2-ligand is the most potent PI in the series. Interestingly, this PI has retained full potency against a range of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants. The protein-ligand X-ray structure of 19b-bound HIV-1 protease revealed important molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions. Chemistry The optically active synthesis of the requisite 5-aminomethyl2-pyrrolidinone for P1-ligands and their conversion to respective sulfonamide isostere are shown in Scheme 1. Commercially available 5-(S)-hydroxymethyl-2-pyrrolidinone 4 was reacted with tosyl chloride and triethylamine to provide tosylate 5. Displacement of the tosylate with sodium azide in DMF at 55 °C for 9 h provided the azide derivative in 92% yield over two

steps. Catalytic hydrogenation of the azide over 10% Pd-C in ethyl acetate afforded optically active amine 6 in quantitative yield. 5-(R)-Hydroxymethyl-2-pyrrolidinone (ent-5) was similarly converted to optically active amine ent-6 in comparable yield. Amine 6 was reacted with commercially available epoxide 7 in the presence of i-Pr2NEt (DIPEA) in 2-propanol at 70 °C for 36 h to provide epoxide-opened product 8 in 85% yield.16 Amine 8 was converted to p-methoxybenezenesulfonamide derivative 9 by reaction with p-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of aqueous NaHCO3 in quantitative yield. Treatment of amine 8 with p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride afforded the corresponding nitrosulfonamide. Catalytic hydrogenation over 10% Pd-C gave the corresponding aniline derivative, which was reacted with benzyl chloroformate in the presence of pyridine to furnish Cbz-derivative 10 in 63% yield for three steps. Enantiomeric amine (ent-6) was converted to the respective methoxy and Cbz-derived 11 and 12 by analogous procedures. The synthesis of various PIs incorporating methylpyrrolidinones as the P1-ligand is shown in Scheme 2. Exposure of Bocderivatives 9 and 10 to 30% CF3CO2H in CH2Cl2 at 23 °C for 40 min resulted in the respective amines 13 and 14. Alkoxycarbonylation of amine 13 with activated mixed carbonates 1516 and 169 in the presence of Et3N in CH2Cl2 furnished inhibitors 17a and 17b in 98% and 87% yields, respectively.17 Alkoxycarbonylation of amine 14 with activated carbonates 15 and 16 afforded the corresponding Cbz-protected urethanes. Removal of the Cbz-group by catalytic hydrogenation over 10% Pd-C in ethyl acetate provided inhibitor 18a and 18b in 58% and 62% yields, respectively. Sulfonamide derivatives 11 and 12 containing enantiomeric P1-ligands were converted to inhibitors 19a,b and 20a,b by following analogous procedures. The synthesis of sulfonamide isosteres incorporating methyloxazolidinone as the P1-ligand is shown in Scheme 3. Optically

over four steps. Enantiomeric azide ent-21 was converted to oxazolidinone derivatives 27 and 28 by following analogous procedures. The synthesis of inhibitors containing oxazolidinone as P1ligand and bis-THF as the P2-ligand is shown in Scheme 4. Treatment of oxazolidinones 25-28 with 30% CF3CO2H in CH2Cl2 at 23 °C afforded the corresponding amines. Reaction of the resulting amines with activated mixed carbonate 15 in the presence of Et3N in CH2Cl2 afforded the target inhibitors 29-32 in excellent yields (80-90%). The structures of these inhibitors are shown in Table 1. Results and Discussion Our examination of the X-ray structure of 1-bound HIV-1 protease and its respective modeling initially suggested that a methyl-2-pyrrolidinone may interact well with residues in the S1-site.15 As shown in Table 1, our first set of inhibitors contain a (R)-hydroxyethylamine sulfonamide isostere with either the bis-THF or Cp-THF as the P2-ligand and p-methoxysulfonamide or p-aminosulfonamide as the P2-ligand. The enzyme inhibitory potency of these PIs was evaluated according to the procedure reported by Toth and Marshall.19 Inhibitor 17a with (S)-methyl2-pyrrolidinone displayed an enzyme Ki of 1 nM. Inhibitor 17b with a Cp-THF showed a 3-fold improvement of potency. Antiviral activity of these inhibitors was determined in MT-2 human T-lymphoid cells exposed to HIV-1LAI. Interestingly, both inhibitors have shown dramatic reduction in antiviral activity. Inhibitors 17a and 17b have shown IC50 values of 0.48 and 0.23 µM, respectively. However, these inhibitors are significantly less potent compared to inhibitors with an isobutyl group as the P1-ligand.7c,9 Incorporation of p-aminosulfonamide (PIs 18a and 18b) as the P2-ligand led to a drop in enzyme inhibitory as well as antiviral potency. Inhibitor 19a containing (R)-methyl2-pyrrolidinone as the P1-ligand has shown 10-fold enhancement of enzyme Ki over the (S)-isomer 17a. It showed a slight improvement in antiviral activity compared to inhibitor 17a. Inhibitor 19b with (R)-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone as the P1-ligand and Cp-THF as the P2-ligand resulted in the most potent inhibitor in the series. It has shown an enzymatic Ki of 99 pM and a 10-fold improvement (IC50 ) 0.026 µM) in antiviral activity relative to epimeric (S)-pyrrolidinone derivative 17b, suggesting an important role for the P1-ring stereochemistry. Indeed, an X-ray structure of 19b-bound HIV-1 protease revealed that the pyrrolidinone carbonyl and the NH functionalities were positioned to hydrogen-bond with residues in the S1-site. Interestingly, the combination of P1-methylpyrrolidi-

active dimethyloxazolidines 21 and ent-21 were prepared by following the procedure described by Dondini and co-workers.18 Reduction of these azides by catalytic hydrogenation in methanol afforded the respective amine. Reaction of 21-derived amine with epoxide 7 in the presence of i-Pr2NEt in 2-propanol afforded amine 22 in 41% yield. Reaction of amine 22 with p-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride or p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride as described previously afforded sulfonamide derivatives 23 and 24 in 80% and 92% yields, respectively. The isopropylidene functionality in 23 and 24 was converted to the corresponding oxazolidinone derivative in a three-step sequence involving (1) treatment of 23 by a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) in methanol, resulting in the removal of the isopropylidene group, (2) reaction of the resulting Boc-amino alcohol with mesyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine to provide the corresponding mesylate, and (3) treatment of the resulting mesylate with i-Pr2NEt in chloroform at reflux. This has provided oxazolidinone 25 in 45% yield over three steps. The nitrosulfonamide derivative 24 was similarly converted to the corresponding oxazolidinone. Catalytic hydrogenation of the resulting nitro derivative with 10% Pd-C in methanol provided aniline derivative 26 in 37% overall yield

a Values are the mean of at least two experiments. b Human T-lymphoid (MT-2) cells (2 × 103) were exposed to 100 TCID50 values of HIV-1LAI and cultured in the presence of each PI, and IC50 values were determined using the MTT assay. The IC50 values of amprenavir (APV), saquinavir (SQV), and indinavir (IDV) were 0.03, 0.015, and 0.03 µM, respectively.

none and polar P2-p-aminosulfonamide led to PIs with subnanomolar enzyme activity. However, antiviral activity was reduced drastically. In PIs 29-32, we have incorporated both (S)- and (R)-oxazolidinone derivatives as substitutes for the respective pyrrolidinone isomers. As can be seen, oxazolidinone derivatives 29-32 have shown subnanomolar enzyme inhibitory potency. Inhibitors with p-methoxysulfonamide as the P2-ligand displayed comparable antiviral activity relative to pyrrolidinone derivatives. Consistent with stereochemical preference, the (R)oxazolidinone with p-methoxysulfonamide has shown better enzyme Ki values. However, the antiviral activity of these compounds is very similar. In general, both pyrrolidinone and oxazolidinone functionalities appear to be nicely accommodated in the S1-site. While inhibitor 31 is very potent in enzyme inhibitory assay, the significant reduction of antiviral potency is possibly due to poor cellular permeability of this polar functionality. Inhibitor 19b appeared to be most potent among the series of inhibitors examined. It exhibited comparable antiviral activity with the FDA approved PIs amprenavir, saquinavir, and indinavir in the same assay. Inhibitor 19b was subsequently examined for its activity against a clinical wild-type X4-HIV-1 isolate (HIV-1ERS104pre)

along with various multidrug-resistant clinical X4- and R5HIV-1 isolates using PBMCs as target cells.8b As can be seen in Table 2, the potency of 19b against HIV-1ER104pre (IC50 ) 28 nM) was comparable to FDA approved PIs indinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir with IC50 values of 28, 25, and 30 nM, respectively. Darunavir, on the other hand, is nearly 10-fold more potent (IC50 ) 3.6 nM) than 19b and the above-mentioned PIs. Interestingly, of all the PIs tested, indinavir was least able to suppress the replication of the multidrug-resistant clinical isolate examined (HIV-1MDR/MM, HIV-1MDR/TM, HIV-1MDR/C, and HIV-1MDR/G) with IC50 values greater than 1 µM. Both amprenavir and lopinavir displayed 10-fold or greater reduction in potency except against HIV-1MDR/G, where lopinavir showed a 5-fold reduction in potency. A more detailed virologic study using inhibitor 19b will be published elsewhere.20 Darunavir has maintained impressive activity against all the multidrug-resistant variants. Inhibitor 19b, while less potent than darunavir, maintained near full potency against multidrugresistant clinical isolates examined. This impressive drugresistance property of 19b is possibly due to its extensive interactions, particularly its ability to make extensive hydrogen bonding throughout the active site of the protease's backbone. Furthermore, inhibitor 19b blocked the infection and replication

of each of the HIV-1NL4-3 variants exposed to and selected by up to 5 µM saquinavir, amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, or ritonavir and a 1 µM lopinavir or atazanavir with EC50 values ranging from 0.036 to 0.14 µM.20 X-ray Crystallography. The binding mode of inhibitor 19b was determined from the X-ray crystal structure of its complex with wild-type HIV-1 protease. The crystal structure was solved and refined at 1.29 Å resolution with an R factor of 14.1%. In this high resolution structure, the inhibitor was bound to the HIV-1 protease active site in two orientations with the relative occupancy of 0.8/0.2. The protease dimer comprises residues 1-99 and 1-99 of the two subunits, and the inhibitor binding site is formed by both subunits. The P1-pyrrolidine ring also showed two alternative conformations with equal occupancy and related by about 18° rotation around the C12-C13 bond. A stereoview of the major conformation is shown in Figure 2 (only one conformation is shown for P1). As shown, extensive interactions from P2 to P2 were observed between the inhibitor and the protease active site, most notably favorable polar interactions including hydrogen bonds, weaker C-H · · · O and C-H · · ·  interactions. The isostere hydroxyl group forms asymmetric hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the catalytic Asp25 and Asp25 with distances of 2.4-3.3 Å. Also, four direct hydrogen bonds are formed between the oxygens or nitrogens of the inhibitor atoms and the protease backbone atoms. These include cyclic ether oxygen of the P2Cp-THF and the Asp-29 NH, the urethane NH with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-27, P2-methoxy oxygen and Asp-30 NH. One conformation of the P1-pyrrolidinone formed a hydrogen bond between the NH and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-27 and a water-mediated hydrogen bond between the P1-pyrrolidinone

carbonyl and the side chain of Arg-8. The other conformation of the P1 group formed hydrophobic and C-H · · · O interactions with Pro-81 and Val-82, as shown in Figure 3. Also, there exists a tetracoordinated water-mediated interaction where the amides of Ile50 and Ile50 donate hydrogen bonds, and the inhibitor's urethane carbonyl and one of the sulfonamide oxygen

accept hydrogen bonds from the water molecule. These interactions are conserved in a majority of other HIV-1 protease complexes with inhibitors21 or substrate analogues.22 The weaker polar interactions such as C-H · · · O and water- interactions can be analyzed accurately in this high resolution structure.23,24 These interactions are important for inhibitorprotease binding and must be considered in the design of inhibitors. The C-H · · · O interactions of the inhibitor with the carbonyl oxygens of Gly-48, Gly-48, and Gly-27 mimic the conserved hydrogen bonds observed with peptide analogue structures.21,22 A conserved water- interaction is observed between the P2 aromatic ring of the inhibitor and the amide of Asp29, which is similar to the interaction with darunavir and other structure-based designed PIs from our laboratories.25,26 The bigger polar P1 group of the 2-pyrrolidinone ring in inhibitor 19b instead of the isobutyl group in PI's 1 and 2 introduces a new direct hydrogen bond with the backbone of HIV-1 protease and one new water-mediated hydrogen bond between the inhibitor and the side chain residue of the protease. The two alternative conformations of the P1 group with occupancy of 0.5/0.5 provide more flexible binding within the S1 subsite, which is likely to enhance the inhibition of resistant proteases. As mentioned earlier, inhibitor 19b maintained near full potency against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates examined. On the other hand, 19b is less potent than darunavir possibly due to the bigger and less optimum size of the P1-ligand. The design strategy of incorporating new polar interactions with conserved backbone regions of the protease warrants further investigation in light of the current molecular insight into these ligand-binding site interactions. Conclusion We have designed a number of HIV-1 protease inhibitors with methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and methyloxazolidinone as the P1-ligand to enhance hydrogen bonding with the protein backbone atoms in the S1-subsite. The ligands were synthesized in enantiomerically pure forms, and a series of inhibitors were prepared and evaluated in combination with P2-bis-THF and P2-Cp-THF ligands. In general, these inhibitors exhibited enzyme inhibitory activity lower than the corresponding inhibitors with a P1-isobutyl group. Our SAR studies indicated the importance of ligand stereochemistry and also preference for the P2-Cp-THF ligand. Interestingly, the polar P1-ligand influenced their cellular properties. The inhibitors exhibited reduction in antiviral activity possibly due to changes in the molecule's overall lipophilicity. Our investigation resulted in the identification of inhibitor 19b which has displayed similar antiviral potency as the other FDA approved inhibitors such as indinavir, lopinavir, and amprenavir. Inhibitor 19b, however, is nearly 10-fold less potent than darunavir. Of particular importance, 19b has maintained full potency against the examined panel of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants. A high resolution X-ray structure of 19b-bound HIV-1 protease revealed a new hydrogen bonding of the P1-pyrrolidinone NH with the backbone carbonyl of Gly27. Also, there is a water mediated hydrogen bond with the pyrrolidinone carboxyl and Arg8 side chain. Furthermore, the P1-pyrrolidinone showed two alternative conformations that filled the S1 subsite. These new interactions and the conformational flexibility most likely contributed to its impressive properties against multidrug-

resistant clinical variants. Further investigations including optimization of ligand-binding properties are in progress. Experimental Section

The resulting mixture was allowed to warm to 23 °C and stirred for 12 h. The reaction was then quenched with 7 mL of water, and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic extracts were washed with 1 N HCl and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4.

Determination of X-ray Structure of 19b-Bound HIV Protease (WT). The stabilized HIV-1 protease with the substitutions of Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A that reduce autoproteolysis and aggregation27 was expressed and purified as described.28 These mutations do not alter the inhibitor binding site, and the stabilized protease has kinetic parameters and stability indistinguishable from those of the unsubstituted enzyme.27,28 Inhibitor 19b was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 1:5 molar ratio of protease (at 3.9 mg/mL) to inhibitor. The reservoir contained 0.1 M citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, 0.35 M NaCl, and 4% DMSO. Crystals were mounted on a nylon loop and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen with a cryoprotectant of 30% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected on the SER-CAT beamline of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 to 1.29 Å resolution.28 Data were reduced in space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a ) 58.11 Å, b ) 86.42 Å, c ) 45.97 Å with one dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the CCP4i,29,30 using WT/GRL0255 complex (PDB 3DJK) as a starting model.26 The structure was refined using SHELX9731,32 and refitted manually using the molecular graphics program COOT.33 Alternative conformations were modeled for the protease residues where observed in the electron density maps. Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters (B-factors) were refined for all atoms including solvent molecules. Hydrogen atoms were automatically added by SHELXL in the last round of the refinement. The identity of ions and other solvent molecules from the crystallization conditions was deduced from the shape and peak height of the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density, the hydrogen bond interactions, and interatomic distances. The solvent molecules were one sodium ion, two chloride ions, one glycerol molecule, and 207 water (including partial occupancy sites). The final R was 14.1% for the working set, and Rfree was 18.2% for all data between 10 and 1.29 Å resolution. The rmsd values from ideal bonds and angle distances were 0.013 and 0.031 Å, respectively. The average B-factor was 15.9 and 22.7 Å2 for protease main chain and side chain atoms, respectively, 14.1 Å2 for inhibitor atoms, and 32.1 Å2 for water atoms. The crystallographic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Databank (PDB) with access code 3H5B.34,35
