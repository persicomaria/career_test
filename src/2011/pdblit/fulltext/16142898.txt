ABSTRACT: The PRL (phosphatase of regenerating liver) phosphatases constitute a novel class of small, prenylated phosphatases that are implicated in promoting cell growth, differentiation, and tumor invasion, and represent attractive targets for anticancer therapy. Here we describe the crystal structures of native PRL-1 as well as the catalytically inactive mutant PRL-1/C104S in complex with sulfate. PRL-1 exists as a trimer in the crystalline state, burying 1140 Å2 of accessible surface area at each dimer interface. Trimerization creates a large, bipartite membrane-binding surface in which the exposed C-terminal basic residues could cooperate with the adjacent prenylation group to anchor PRL-1 on the acidic inner membrane. Structural and kinetic analyses place PRL-1 in the family of dual specificity phopsphatases with closest structural similarity to the Cdc14 phosphatase and provide a molecular basis for catalytic activation of the PRL phosphatases. Finally, native PRL-1 is crystallized in an oxidized form in which a disulfide is formed between the active site Cys104 and a neighboring residue Cys49, which blocks both substrate binding and catalysis. Biochemical studies in solution and in the cell support a potential regulatory role of this intramolecular disulfide bond formation in response to reactive oxygen species such as H2O2.

Reversible protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a vital regulatory mechanism that lies at the center of almost all eukaryotic cellular processes (1). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation is modulated by the combined action of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs),1 which constitute a large and structurally diverse family of signaling enzymes (2). Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that PTPs are essential for many physiological processes and are involved in a number of human diseases (3). The hallmark that defines the PTP superfamily is the active site sequence C(X)5R(S/T), also known as the PTP

signature motif, in the catalytic domain. Based on this unique structural feature, it is estimated that more than 100 PTPs are encoded in the human genome. The PTP superfamily can be broadly divided into two groups: the classical phosphotyrosine specific PTPs, and dual specificity phosphatases that catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphoserine/ phosphothreonine as well as phosphotyrosine. The PRL (phosphatase of regenerating liver) phosphatases represent a unique subfamily of PTPs with an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa (4, 5). This subfamily includes only three members (PRL-1, PRL-2, and PRL-3), which share a high degree (>75%) of amino acid sequence identity. The PRL phosphatases contain a consensus C-terminal prenylation motif CaaX, where C is cysteine, the a's are aliphatic residues, and X can be any amino acids. Indeed, all three enzymes are prenylated at their C terminus, which is important for their localization to the plasma membrane and early endosomal compartments (5-7). Interestingly, PRL-1 can also relocalize to the nucleus in mitotic HeLa cells in a prenylation-independent manner, raising the possibility that the cellular location of PRL-1 may be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent fashion (8). PRL-1 was originally identified as an immediate early gene, which is induced during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (4). PRL-1 expression is elevated in several tumor cell lines, and overexpression of PRL-1 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts leads to anchorage-independent growth (4, 8). In addition to cell proliferation and transformation, PRL-1 may also be involved in the regulation of epithelial cell differentiation in the digestive system (9, 10) and in skeletal development (11). The closely related PRL-2 and PRL-3 may also play a role in the regulation of cell growth and

For example, PRL-2 level is elevated in prostate cancer (15), while overexpression of PRL-2 causes transformation in mouse fibroblasts and hamster pancreatic epithelial cells and promotes tumor growth in nude mice (4, 5). Increased level of PRL-3 in HEK293 cells also leads to higher growth rates (12). Recently, the PRL phosphatases have attracted much attention because of the observation that PRL-3 transcript is highly overexpressed in liver metastases of colorectal cancer, but not in nonmetastatic primary tumors and in normal colorectal epithelium (16). In fact, PRL-3 mRNA level was found to be elevated in nearly all metastatic lesions derived from colorectal cancers, regardless of the sites of metastasis (7, 17). In addition, PRL-3 may also promote the invasion and metastasis of human gastric carcinomas (18) and mouse melanoma (19). Finally, CHO cells stably expressing PRL-3 or PRL-1 exhibit enhanced motility and invasive activity, and induce metastatic tumor formation in mice (13). It has been shown that the phosphatase activity of the PRL phosphatases is required for the observed tumor metastasis activity (13, 20). Given the roles of PRL phosphatases in cellular growth, transformation, and metastatic processes, the PRL phosphatases represent attractive targets for anticancer therapeutic development. To understand the mechanism of action of the PRL phosphatases, we began a structural and biochemical investigation of PRL-1. While this work was in progress, the basic protein fold was published for PRL-3 on the basis of NMR data (21). Unfortunately, the active site was disordered in the NMR structure. Subsequently, a crystal structure was reported for an inactive PRL-1 mutant with a Ser substituted for the active site Cys104 (PRL-1/C104S) (22). Here, we describe the crystal structures of native PRL-1 and the catalytically inactive PRL-1/C104S in complex with sulfate anion. Our data revealed a large electrostatic surface in the trimeric PRL-1 structures, which is likely important for membrane binding. In addition, the active site Cys104 was found to form a disulfide bond with a nearby residue Cys49 in the native PRL-1 structures, suggesting a potential mechanism for redox regulation. Finally, we report an indepth structure-function analysis of PRL-1, which furnishes a molecular basis for catalytic activation of the PRL phosphatases. Taken together, our studies provide novel insights into the mechanism of catalysis, regulation, and cellular localization of this important class of PRL phosphatases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Fluke Co. 3-O-Methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) was obtained from Sigma. 6,8-Difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) was purchased from Molecular Probes. 2-Chloro-4-nitrophenyl phosphate was synthesized as described (23). Sequencing grade trypsin were provided by Sigma (St. Louis, MO). ZipTipC18 was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. A 30% solution of H2O2 was purchased from Fisher. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available commercially. Expression and Purification of PRL-1 and Mutant Proteins. The expression plasmid for the His6-tagged rat PRL-1

Sun et al. was provided by Dr. Rebecca Taub (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). For crystallization, the His6tagged C-terminal truncated PRL-1 and GST-PRL-1 (residues 1-160) were subcloned into pET15b and pGEX vectors, respectively. All mutants were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The sequences of the wild-type and mutant PRL-1s were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression, wild-type and mutant PRL-1s were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and induced by 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio- -D-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 20 h. The His6-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-NTA resin based upon the procedure provided by Qiagen. Proteins were judged to be at least 90% pure by SDS-PAGE. For selenomethioninelabeled PRL-1, the pGEX-PRL-1 was transformed into B834(DE3) cells, and the protein was purified by Glutathione Sepharose 4B followed by thrombin cleavage. The protein was further purified by Mono-S ion exchange chromatography before crystallization. Crystallization and Data Collection. The full-length His6tagged PRL-1 proved difficult to crystallize, so several constructs with N-terminal or C-terminal truncations were prepared. The construct with an N-terminal His6 tag attached to PRL-1 residues 1-160 crystallized at 4 °C in 100 mM sodium acetate trihydrate pH 4.8 and 2.0 M ammonium sulfate after 2 weeks. Adding 3% ethanol into the crystallization solutions increased the size of the crystals, and this form of the crystals diffracted to 8 Å using a home light source. The diffraction quality was significantly increased when crystals were soaked in 2.4 M ammonium sulfate with 25% glycerol overnight. The final data for this form of crystals were collected up to 3.2 Å for the native protein and 2.9 Å for the PRL-1/C104S mutant at beam line X9A of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory) and at MacCHESS F2 station, respectively. The crystals of both wild-type and mutant PRL-1 exhibited diffraction consistent with space group I213 with unit-cell parameters of a ) b ) c ) 146.8 Å. Crystals of selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted His6tagged PRL-1 were quite small and not suitable for data collection. SeMet-substituted GST-PRL-1 was generated and the GST removed by thrombin after purification of the fusion protein. The SeMet PRL-1 protein was crystallized under similar conditions to the His6-tagged PRL-1 albeit with a broader pH range (4.8-5.4). The SeMet PRL-1 protein crystallized in a rectangular shape, which is different from the cubic crystals obtained from the His6-tagged PRL-1. Diffraction from these crystals is consistent with space group C2221 with unit-cell parameters of a ) 71.3 Å, b ) 105.6 Å, c ) 181.4 Å and extends to 1.9 Å at beam line 19BM of the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Structure Solution. The structure of the SeMet substituted PRL-1 was solved using data from a SeMet multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment. Data collected at three wavelengths, peak (1), edge (2), and remote (3), were processed and scaled with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (24). The asymmetric unit contained three monomers of the PRL-1 protein. The initial MAD phases calculated to 2.8 Å using SOLVE yielded a clear electron density map in which more than 70% of the polypeptide chain could be assigned (25-27). The model was built with the program O (28), and the structure was further refined

During the initial refinement, an NCS restraint for all regions except the PTP loop (104-110), WPD loop (69-73), and two additional loops (residues 20-26, 5055) was performed. Subsequent refinement consisted of simulated annealing, energy minimization, and individual temperature factor refinement using all data between 30 and 1.9 Å. Composite simulated annealing OMIT maps were used to correct model bias. At the final stage of refinement, the NCS restraints were released and water was added. The final model has an R-factor of 24.5% and an Rfree of 25.7%. The structures of the His6-tagged PRL-1 and C104S mutant in complex with sulfate were solved by molecular replacement using the initial 2.8 Å MAD model. The final three structures include all residues from 9 to 160 except residues 71-72 of one SeMet PRL-1 molecule among three molecules in one asymmetric unit. Kinetic Constants for PRL-1 Catalyzed Reaction. Initial rate measurements for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP were conducted as described previously (30). All assays were carried out at 25 °C in a pH 7.0 buffer of 50 mM 3,3-dimethylglutarate, containing 2 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA, with an ionic strength of 0.15 M, adjusted by addition of NaCl. For pNPP reaction, assay mixtures of 200 µL in total volume were set up in a 96-well polystyrene plate from Fisher Scientific. A substrate concentration range from 0.2 to 5 Km was used to determine the kcat and Km. Reactions were started by the addition of an appropriate amount of PRL-1. The reaction mixtures were quenched with 50 µL of 5 M sodium hydroxide, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read using a plate reader. With 4-chlorophenyl phosphate, 6,8-DiFMUP, and OMFP as substrates, PRL-1 activity was determined using a continuous assay by monitoring the absorbance at 405, 360, and 477 nm, respectively, as described (30). The steady-state kinetic parameters were determined from a direct fit of the data to the MichaelisMenten equation using the nonlinear regression program KINETASYST (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA). In Vitro InactiVation of PRL-1 by H2O2. To study the effect of H2O2 on PRL-1 activity, DTT was removed from PRL-1 preparations by Superdex-75 gel filtration. PRL-1 inactivation by H2O2 was studied at 25 °C in a pH 7.0 buffer of 50 mM 3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mM EDTA, with an ionic strength of 0.15 M, adjusted by addition of NaCl. The rate of PRL-1 inactivation by H2O2 was determined by following the decrease of PRL-1 phosphatase activity in the presence of 6,8-DiFMUP. The PRL-1-catalyzed hydrolysis of 6,8DiFMUP was monitored by fluorescence at 470 nm (excitation 390 nm) from the reaction product using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B fluorometer. The apparent first-order rate constant k for PRL-1 inactivation was determined by fitting the data to F ) F0 + V0(1 - e-kt)/k, where F is the fluorescence at time t, F0 is initial fluorescence at time zero, and V0 is the initial velocity. The second-order rate constant kinact was determined by fitting the apparent first-order rate constants determined at several H2O2 concentrations to k ) A + kinactC, where C is the concentration of H2O2. ReactiVation Kinetics of H2O2-InactiVated PRL-1 by DTT. PRL-1 (1 mg/mL) was incubated with H2O2 (250 µM) for 30 min. Excess H2O2 was removed by addition of 1 µg of catalase to the reaction mixture (200 µL). After the enzyme was fully inactivated, 10 mM DTT was added to the reaction mixture to reactivate the enzyme. The activity of PRL-1 was

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 36, 2005 12011 monitored using DiFMUP as a substrate by a continuous assay as described above. Mass Spectrometry. Purified wild-type and mutant PRL-1 proteins were subjected to Superdex 75 chromatography to remove DTT. The resulting protein at 1 mg/mL concentration was treated with 100 µM H2O2 for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 µg of catalase. The PRL-1 protein was digested with trypsin (50:1 PRL-1:trypsin ratio) overnight at 37 °C. The digested peptides were desalted using ZipTipC18 and analyzed by a Voyager DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in positive and linear mode. Cell Culture and Transfection. HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant PRL-1s tagged at their NH2 termini with hemagglutinin (HA) were subcloned into the pCDNA-3 plasmid, and the resulting vectors were introduced into HEK293 cells by transfection with the use of Lipofectamine (Qiagen). Identification of Reduced and Oxidized Forms of PRL-1 by Immunoblot Analysis. Before stimulation, HEK293 cells were changed into a serum-free medium. After treatment with indicated concentrations of H2O2 for 5 min, the cells (2 × 106 cells in 2 mL of DMEM) were scraped into 0.4 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer including 25 mM NaAc, 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.5, 10 mM iodoacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor cocktail. The cell suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 10000g for 15 min. Equal amounts of protein from the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and the separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antiHA antibody. Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences or Pierce). Subcellular Fractionation. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged PRL-1 constructs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were washed and scraped down in 1 mL of ice-cold Hepes buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail, 250 mM Sucrose). Then the cells were passed through a 27-gauge needle 20 times. The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min to pellet the nuclei and intact cells, and the supernatant was again centrifuged at 100000g for 60 min to obtain the S100 soluble fraction and the P100 membrane fraction. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz). Chemical Cross-Linking. To assess the oligomeric state of PRL-1 and its mutants, the proteins were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (Sigma, 25% glutaraldehyde solution, grade I). For His6-tagged recombinant PRL-1 proteins, the reactions were performed in 100 µL solutions containing 5 µg of proteins in pH 7.5 PBS buffer. Cross-linking was initiated by adding 0.005% glutaraldehyde. For HA-PRL-1 expressed in HEK293 cells, the P100 membrane fraction in Hepes buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) was incubated with 0.01% glutaraldehyde. After standing for 30 min at 25

The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDSPAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody or anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz), respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystallization and Structure Determination. The fulllength PRL-1 is a protein of 173 amino acids with a C-terminal prenylation motif (CCIQ). Numerous attempts to crystallize the N-terminal His6-tagged full-length PRL-1 were unsuccessful. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained with a C-terminal truncated PRL-1 construct (residues 1-160) containing an N-terminal His6 tag. The C-terminal truncated PRL-1, hereby referred to as wild-type or native PRL-1, exhibited phosphatase activity similar to that of the full-length enzyme. Good quality crystals were also obtained for an inactive PRL-1 with Ser substituted for the active site Cys104 (PRL-1/C104S). The wild-type PRL-1 and PRL-1/C104S crystals formed in space group I213 and diffracted to 3.2 and 2.9 Å, respectively. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted PRL-1 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, purified and cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST-tag. The SeMet PRL-1 crystallized in a rectangular shape, which is different from the cubic crystals obtained from the His6-tagged PRL-1 proteins. Diffraction from the SeMet-substituted PRL-1 crystals was consistent with space group C2221 and extended to 1.9 Å resolution. The structure of PRL-1 was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method using data derived from the SeMet-substituted PRL-1. Data collected at three wavelengths, peak (1), edge (2), and remote (3), were processed and scaled with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (24). There were three PRL-1 molecules in each asymmetric unit. The initial MAD phases were calculated to 2.8 Å using SOLVE (25-27). The model was built

with program O (28) and further refined by CNS (29). The final structure of the native PRL-1 was refined to 1.9 Å resolution with an R-factor of 24.5% and an Rfree of 25.7%. The crystal structures of the His6-tagged PRL-1 and the C104S mutant in complex with sulfate, refined to 3.2 and 2.9 Å resolution, respectively, were solved by molecular replacement using the initial 2.8 Å MAD model. The details of the crystals and structure solution are summarized in Table 1. OVerall Structure of PRL-1. PRL-1 has a compact R + structure comprising a central five-stranded sheet surrounded by four R helixes on one side and two R helixes on the other (Figure 1A). Like other members of the PTP superfamily, the PTP signature motif of PRL-1 (H103CVAGLGR110) forms a loop (P-loop) at the base of the active site pocket. The topology of PRL-1 resembles those of the catalytic domains of dual specificity phosphatases. A comparison using DALI (31) reveals that the PRL-1 structure is most similar to the catalytic domain of Cdc14 (32), KAP (33), and PTEN (34) with Z-scores of 17.8, 16.5, and 15.3, respectively. The structure of PRL-1 was superimposed to Cdc14 (residues 216-370, Figure 1B), KAP (residues 30190), and PTEN (residues 25-185) with root-mean-square deviation values of 1.8, 2.1, and 1.9 Å for Ca pairs, respectively. A structure-based amino acid sequence alignment of the PRL phosphatases with Cdc14, KAP, and PTEN, as well as the prototypical dual specificity phosphatase VHR (35), is shown in Figure 1C. In general, there are good alignments in the core regions between the PRLs and the dual specificity phosphatases. However, substantial differences are observed in various surface loop regions. The two N-terminal loops, loop 1 ( 2-R1) and loop 2 ( 3-R2), are the most variable regions among the dual specific phosphatases. These loops define the entrance of the active site and are important for substrate binding as revealed in the structure of KAP in complex with its physiological substrate

Cdk2 (33). Compared with Cdc14, KAP, and PTEN, loops 1 and 2 in PRL-1 are significantly shorter (Figure 1B,C), which may contribute to PRL-1's specificity for its binding partners or substrates. These shorter loops also render PRL-1 with a more open and shallow active site. PRL-1 Exists as a Trimer in the Crystal. The structures reported here revealed an identical trimeric arrangement of the PRL-1 molecules (Figure 2A) in two different crystallographic space groups (I213 for the His6-tagged native PRL-1 and PRL-1/C104S, and C2221 for the SeMetsubstituted PRL-1) despite considerable differences in macromolecular packing. Moreover, while this manuscript was in preparation, Jeong et al. reported a structure of PRL-1/ C104S (residues 4-163), which also crystallized as a trimer under totally different conditions in the P21 space group (22). These observations indicate that the trimeric state is structurally relevant. PRL-1 trimerization occurs around a 3-fold rotational axis that fixes the C-terminal sequence of each monomer on the same surface of the trimer (Figure 2B). Since the C-terminal sequence contains the prenylation motif (Figure 1C), it is likely that the C-terminal surface directly faces the plasma membrane. The PRL-1 active site points to the outside of the trimer interface and is positioned opposite to the C-terminal membrane association region (Figure 2B). The vertical distance between the active site and C-terminal surface is 21 Å.

The PRL-1 trimer is stabilized by a combination of hydrophobic and polar interactions. The total buried accessible surface area between the monomers at each dimer interface is 1130-1150 Å2, which amounts to about 29% of the total surface area of each monomer. Upon trimer formation, helix R5 of one monomer (residues 124-134) interacts with the R1 helix, the 1- 2 hairpin, and the R35 loop of another monomer (Figure 2C). Notably, Arg138 of R5 protrudes into the hydrophobic pocket created by Lys39 and Tyr40 in the R1 helix, forming a salt bridge with Glu36. At the other side, Pro96 from loop R3- 5 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket created by Leu146 in R6, Val130 and Tyr126 in R5. In addition to these interactions, the side chains of Asp128, Gln131, Arg134, and Gln135 make 5 hydrogen bonds with the main chain amides or carbonyls of the 12 hairpin and the R3- 5 loop, and one hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg18. It is important to point out that the observed dimer interface interactions involve residues (e.g. Arg18, Glu36, Pro96, Met124, Tyr126, Asp128, Val130, Arg138, and Leu146) that are conserved among all PRL family members and across all species. Consequently, trimer formation may be a general property of all PRL enzymes. The observation that PRL-1 exists in a trimeric state in the crystal is novel among the PTPs. However, it is not clear whether PRL-1 is also capable of trimer formation in solution and/or in the cell. To address this question, we performed

gel filtration, ultracentrifugation, and dynamic light scattering experiments at PRL-1 concentrations of 0.1-3 mg/mL. Under these conditions PRL-1 appeared mostly as monomers (data not shown). Similarly, PRL-3 was observed as a monomer in NMR experiments even at mM concentrations (21, 36). To further evaluate the potential for PRL-1 trimerization, we conducted cross-linking experiments with both purified recombinant PRL-1 protein and membrane fractions derived from HEK293 cells expressing the fulllength HA-tagged PRL-1. The cross-linked proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Figure 3A,B, crosslinking of purified PRL-1 protein as well as full-length PRL-1 in cell membranes with glutaraldehyde resulted in new bands with molecular weights corresponding to PRL-1 dimer, trimer, and higher oligomers. This indicates that although in solution the equilibrium may favor the monomer, PRL-1 has the intrinsic ability to form dimer, trimer, or higher oligomers. We next determined if structural perturbations to the dimer interface would affect trimer formation. We introduced mutations into PRL-1 that were expected to either ablate the salt bridge between Glu36 and Arg138 (E36A/R138A) or disrupt the polar interactions between Arg18 and Gln131 (R18A/Q131A) (Figure 2C). To introduce more dramatic changes into the dimer interface, we also replaced Gly97 with an Arg. We expressed and purified each of the mutant proteins and determined that these mutations had little effect on the catalytic activity of PRL-1 (Table 2). As shown in Figure 3A, R18A/Q131A and E36A/R138A exhibited similar oligomerization potential as the wild-type PRL-1, indicating that interruption of neither the salt bridge between Glu36 and Arg138 nor the polar interactions between Gln131 and Arg18 was sufficient to abolish PRL-1 trimer formation.

contrast, introduction of a more bulky Arg residue to position 97 substantially reduced PRL-1 trimerization both in solution and in cell membrane fractions (Figure 3A,B). Collectively, the results show that even though PRL-1 may exist primarily

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 36, 2005 12015 contrast, when all six positively charged residues in the polybasic stretch were replaced with alanines, the resulting mutant PRL-1/6A was found completely in the soluble fraction (Figure 4B). The observation that PRL-1/6A failed to localize to the membrane suggests that PRL-1 prenylation alone is insufficient for plasma membrane localization and that the C-terminal polybasic region is required for proper membrane targeting of PRL-1. Collectively, our results indicate that localization of PRL-1 to the plasma membrane requires both insertion of the prenylation group into the lipid bilayer and ionic interactions between the polybasic region and the acidic membrane surface. Interestingly, the dual requirement of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions for correct membrane targeting has also been noted for a number of important signaling proteins including small G protein K-ras and the Src kinase (37-39). The PRL-1 ActiVe Site. The activity of PRL-1 toward the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was orders of magnitude lower than those of tyrosine specific phosphatases (e.g. PTP1B (40) and the Yersinia PTP (41)) and dual specificity phosphatases (e.g. VHR (42) and Cdc14 (30)) (Table 2). Similar low activity toward synthetic substrates was also noted for PRL-3 (21). To begin to probe the active site properties of PRL-1, we determined the kinetic parameters for the PRL-1 catalyzed hydrolysis of a panel of aromatic phosphates, including 1-ringed, 2-ringed, and multiringed substrates. As shown in Table 3, the kcat values are similar for all aryl phosphate substrates even though their leaving group pKa values are markedly different. This suggests that the rate-determining step for the PRL-1 reaction is most likely hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (43), although we cannot exclude the possibility that intermediate formation is rate-limiting when the general acid is in full operation. The kcat/Km value, which is a measure of substrate specificity, differs in a dramatic manner. An examination of kcat/Km values reveals that the active site specificity of PRL-1 is distinct from those of other dual specificity phosphatases, such as Cdc25 phosphatases, MAP kinase phosphatases, and VHR, which display a striking preference (2-3 orders of magnitude) for the bulky 3-ringed substrate 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) (44-49). Thus, in line with the structural similarity to Cdc14, the active site specificity of PRL-1 is also similar to that of Cdc14 (30), with a strong preference for two-ringed aryl phosphates (6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, DiFMUP) over smaller one-ringed (pNPP and 2-chloro-4nitrophenyl phosphate) or larger, 3-ringed substrate (OMFP), a finding that may have important implications for inhibitor design. To determine the molecular basis for the extremely low activity toward small molecule substrates, we analyzed the structure of PRL-1/C104S in complex with a sulfate ion bound at the active site (Figure 5A). Like the substrate phosphate group, the sulfate ion sits in the middle of the P-loop, which is composed of the PTP signature motif C(X)5R. In the PTP mechanism, the Cys residue in the P-loop is situated at the base of the active site pocket and functions as a nucleophile while the Arg coordinates the substrate phosphoryl group (43). In addition to strong polar interactions with the P-loop amides, the sulfate ion also makes two hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium group of Arg110 in the P-loop, which in turn is engaged in hydro-

as monomers under our experimental solution conditions, it clearly has intrinsic propensity to form trimers. In the cell, the PRL phosphatases are prenylated at their C termini (5-7), which should anchor them to the plasma membrane. The increase in local PRL-1 concentration in the membrane upon PRL-1 prenylation would be expected to significantly promote trimerization. We speculate that the PRL-1 trimers observed in the crystal forms would most likely mimic the trimerization of intact PRL-1 localized in the membrane given that the C-terminal prenylation motif resides on the lipid-facing surface. It is possible that PRL-1 trimerization in the cell may represent a novel mechanism for regulation, although its biological significance will require further investigation. The Polybasic Region in the C-Terminal of PRL-1 Is Required for Plasma Membrane Association. The PRL phosphatases have a conserved C-terminal polybasic region composed of multiple lysines and arginines (Lys151, Arg153, Lys155, Arg157, Arg159 and Lys161), which immediately precedes the CaaX sequence (Figure 1C). These basic residues are solvent exposed, and together with Lys90, Arg93, and Lys125 they are clustered on the C-terminal side of the trimer forming a strikingly basic patch that should interact favorably with the acidic membrane surface (Figure 4A). This structural feature was not apparent in the previously reported PRL-1/C104S structure, which contains residues 8-156 (22). To investigate whether this polybasic region is required for membrane association, we transfected the HAtagged full-length wild-type as well as mutant PRL-1 constructs into HEK293 cells and determined their subcellular localization. To ensure that mutations would not cause gross structural perturbations, all mutant recombinant PRL-1 proteins were purified, characterized, and found to have phosphatase activity similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). Consistent with previous findings (5, 6), full-length PRL1, which should be prenylated inside the cells, was found predominantly in the membrane fraction, whereas a mutant lacking the C-terminal prenylation motif (PRL-1/1-169) localized entirely to the soluble cytoplasmic fraction (Figure 4B). This confirms the importance of the C-terminal prenylation for PRL-1 plasma membrane localization. To determine whether PRL-1 trimerization affects its membrane localization, we also examined the subcellular fractionation of PRL-1/G97R, which is defective in trimer formation. As shown in Figure 4B, disruption of trimer formation had no effect on PRL-1 association with the membrane. In stark

phobic interactions with the phenyl ring of Phe70 and a polar interaction with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Phe70 (Figure 5B). As a result of these interactions, the WPD loop is in a closed conformation, placing the carboxylate of Asp72 close (3.66 Å) to the sulfate oxygen, which is structurally homologous to the scissile oxygen of a substrate. This observation suggests that the Asp72 most likely acts as a general acid in PRL-1 catalysis. Although many of the interactions with the oxyanion involving the P-loop and the WPD loop in PRL-1 are similar to those found in other PTPs, there are also significant differences between the active sites of PRL-1 and other members of the PTP superfamily (e.g., Yersinia PTP and Cdc14), which display a higher intrinsic activity toward pNPP. These differences may account for PRL-1's low basal activity toward artificial substrates. For example, in most PTPs a conserved Ser or Thr is placed immediately after the invariant Arg residue in the PTP signature motif. In PRLs, this position is occupied by Ala111. In the Cdc14 structure (Figure 5B) (32), the hydroxyl group of the conserved Thr321 is approximately 2.8 Å to the S of the active site Cys314, making a good S-HO hydrogen bond. Mutagenesis and kinetic studies have shown that the conserved hydroxyl group in the P-loop plays an important role in the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (43). In agreement with this finding, when Ala111 was replaced with a Ser, the kcat of PRL-1/A111S toward pNPP increased 15-fold, while the kcat/ Km value, which monitors the kinetic steps leading to and

including the formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate, was only 2-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). In addition to the lack of a conserved hydroxyl group in the PTP signature motif, PRL-1 is also missing a key H-bonding network that stabilizes the P-loop. In Cdc14, the conserved Arg348 (equivalent to Arg440 in the Yersinia PTP and Arg257 in PTP1B) makes two well-defined H-bonds with the main chain carbonyl oxygens in the middle of the P-loop. Arg347 is in turn anchored by polar interactions with the side chains of Asn217 and Asp215 (Figure 5B). Substitution of this Arg with an Ala in the Yersinia PTP, PTP1B, and Cdc14 results in greater than 3 orders of magnitude decrease in kcat (50, 51; Wang, W.-Q., unpublished observations). In MKP3, this important Arg is replaced with a Lys, which was proposed partially responsible for MKP3's low basal activity toward pNPP (52). While the corresponding Arg137 is present in PRL-1, its interactions with the P-loop are rather weak (Figure 5B). Furthermore, PRL-1 does not have the tertiary residues (Asn217 and Asp215 in Cdc14) that serve to stabilize the conformation of Arg137. Consequently, the contribution of Arg137 to PRL-1 catalysis is not expected to be as important as those from the corresponding Arg in the Yersinia PTP, PTP1B, and Cdc14. Indeed, when the side chain of Arg137 is removed, the kcat for PRL-1/R137A is only 10-fold lower than that of the wildtype enzyme (Table 2). Finally, PRL-1 also lacks a H-bond that is potentially important for the stabilization of the C-terminal part of the P-loop. In Cdc14 (as well as other PTPs), the C-terminal portion of the P-loop is anchored by two H-bonds between the amides of Leu352 and Thr323 and the carbonyls of Leu318 and Gly319 in the P-loop, plus an additional H-bond between the side chain of Thr323 and the carbonyl of Gly319 (Figure 5B). The latter H-bond is absent in PRL-1 because the corresponding Thr323 is substituted by a Val in PRL-1 (Val113) (Figure 5B). In support of the importance of this H-bond, introduction of a Thr residue at position 113 increased the kcat and kcat/Km for the PRL-1/V113T-catalyzed pNPP reaction by 4.4- and 7.0-fold, respectively (Table 2).

Structure and Biochemical Analysis of PRL-1

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 36, 2005 12017 substrate turnover. Binding of a small molecule substrate or a nonspecific substrate may not be sufficient to induce a conformational change in PRL-1 so that the P-loop is properly positioned for catalysis. Redox Regulation of PRL-1 ActiVity. The PRL-1 proteins were crystallized in the presence of 1 mM DTT. Unexpectedly, the crystal structures for the native PRL-1 reported here showed well-ordered electron density in the active site consistent with a disulfide bond linking the catalytic Cys104 with a neighboring Cys49 (Figure 6A). Like the active site Cys104, Cys49 is invariant among all PRLs. The presence of a disulfide bridge between Cys104 and Cys49 suggests that the active site Cys104 is highly susceptible to oxidation. Although oxidation of the PTP active site Cys generally leads to the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate (53-55), intramolecular disulfide formation between the active site nucleophilic Cys and a nearby Cys residue has also been observed in KAP (33), PTEN (56), Cdc25 (57, 58), and the low molecular weight PTPs (59). The distance between the CR atoms of the two cysteine residues is 4.68 Å in PRL-1, which is in the range (4.4-5.9 Å long) of the normal CRCR distance of disulfide bonds (60). This indicates that the redox-mediated disulfide formation between Cys104 and Cys49 in PRL-1 should be a facile process and can occur without any major conformational change. Given the importance of the catalytic Cys in PTP catalysis, blocking of the nucleophilic thiolate in Cys104 with a disulfide is expected to render PRL-1 inactive. In addition to demolition of the nucleophilic capability of the active site Cys104, disulfide formation in PRL-1 is accompanied by localized conformational changes (P-loop and WPD-loop) in the active site (Figure 6B). As a result of the disulfide bond between Cys104 and Cys49, the CR of Cys49 is shifted 1.25 Å toward the active site, while no other significant structure movements are observed in 3 where Cys49 resides. Moreover, disulfide bond formation also imposes conformational constraints on the P-loop and increases the  angle of Cys104 from 20° to 56°. Consequently, the P-loop adopts a hairpin conformation in the native PRL-1 structures as opposed to the helical conformation in the PRL-1/C104S structure in complex with a sulfate anion (Figure 6B). In the latter structure, the sulfate is at the center of the P-loop and within 3 Å from every amide nitrogen of the P-loop. This orientation of the P-loop amides is essential for oxyanion binding. However, in the oxidized PRL-1 structures, the carbonyls of Gly107 and Leu108, instead of the amides, are pointing toward the inside of the P-loop, which reduces the positively charge character of the P-loop. As a result, although PRL-1 was crystallized in 2 M sulfate, bound sulfate was not observed in the oxidized PRL-1 crystal. Thus, disulfide formation in the PRL-1 active site also disrupts its ability to bind substrates. The direct observation of a disulfide bond between Cys104 and Cys49 in the PRL-1 crystal structure suggests a redox mechanism for PRL-1 regulation. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of H2O2 on PRL-1 activity. H2O2 is implicated as an intracellular messenger that is generated in response to growth factor stimulation (61), and H2O2 can modulate intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation by reversible inactivation of PTPs (62). As expected, we found that H2O2 can inactivate PRL-1 in a time- and concentrationdependent first-order process (data not shown). Analysis of

(B) Comparison of active site interactions between PRL-1 and Cdc14.

Collectively, the structural and biochemical data suggest that the active site of PRL-1 is not optimally primed for hydrolysis of nonspecific substrates. Although the physiological substrates of the PRL phosphatases remain to be identified, one would predict that the association of PRL-1 with its physiological substrates and/or activators would elicit catalytic activation of PRL-1 by facilitating the repositioning of the P-loop and other active site residues for optimal

(C) Disulfide bond formation between Cys104 and Cys49 of PRL-1 in HEK293 cells exposed to H2O2. Transfected cells expressing HA-tagged PRL or mutants were incubated with H2O2, after which cellular protein extracts were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE and analyzed with anti-HA antibodies.

the pseudo-first-order rate constant as a function of H2O2 concentration yielded a second-order rate constant of 15.4 M-1 s-1, a value similar to those measured for other PTPs (53). PRL-1/C49S displayed a slightly lower activity than that of the wild-type PRL-1 (Table 2). Like the native enzyme, PRL-1/C49S could also be inactivated upon H2O2

treatment. Similar to other PTPs, the activity of the H2O2inactivated PRL-1 can be fully recovered with DTT. To determine whether the H2O2-mediated PRL-1 inactivation resulted in the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys104 and Cys49, we analyzed the PRL-1 protein treated with or without H2O2 by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing

Structure and Biochemical Analysis of PRL-1 conditions. Since disulfide formation generally results in a more compact protein structure, we would predict that the disulfide form of PRL-1 should migrate faster on SDSPAGE under nonreducing conditions. Indeed, H2O2 treatment of PRL-1 led to the appearance of a faster migrating band on nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Figure 7A). Upon reduction with DTT, the gel mobility of the H2O2-treated PRL-1 was restored to the same level exhibited by the native PRL-1 protein. However, when either Cys49 or Cys104 was changed to a Ser, the mobility of the PRL-1/C49S and PRL-1/C104S mutants was not affected by H2O2. These results thus are consistent with Cys104 in the active site of PRL-1 forming a disulfide bond with Cys49 upon oxidation with H2O2. To provide more direct evidence for the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys104 and Cys49, we subjected the H2O2-treated PRL-1 to trypsin digestion followed by MALDITOF mass spectrometric analysis. As shown in Figure 7B, peak I was found to contain a peptide of molecular mass MH+ of 2016.13 Da, which corresponds to the active site tryptic peptide F92REEPGCCIAVHCVAGLGR110 (calculated MH+ 2016.95 Da). Peak II corresponds to the same peptide from PRL-1/C104S in which Cys104 is replaced with a Ser (MH+ 2000.97 Da calculated, MH+ 2000.19 observed). Peak III with an observed MH+ of 3485.53 is in close agreement with the MH+ of 3485.65 calculated for a 32-residue fragment of PRL-1 in which a Cys104-containing peptide (F92REEPGCCIAVHCVAGLGR110, calculated MH+ 2016.95) and a Cys49-containig peptide (V48CEATYDTTLVEK60, calculated MH+ 1471.70) are bridged by a disulfide bond. In contrast, H2O2 treatment of PRL-1/C104S and PRL-1/ C49S did not yield the disulfide-bridged peak III (Figure 7B). These results provide further support that Cys104 and Cys49 of PRL-1 form a disulfide bond upon exposure to H2O2. Interestingly, a new peak (peak IV, MH+ 2048.63 Da) emerged from the trypsin digest of the H2O2-treated PRL1/C49S sample, whose MH+ is 32 mass units higher than that of the active site peptide F92REEPGCCIAVHCVAGLGR110 (peak I). One possibility may be that one of the Cys residues in the F92REEPGCCIAVHCVAGLGR110 sequence of PRL-1/C49S was oxidized by H2O2 to produce an irreversible sulfinic acid derivative. Since peak IV was absent in the PRL-1/C104S sample, the sulfinic acid in peak IV is most likely derived from the oxidation of Cys104 in PRL-1/C49S. The data thus indicate that, in the absence of Cys49, the active site Cys104 is more vulnerable to oxidation by H2O2. We could speculate that one intriguing function of Cys49 to form an intramolecular S-S bond with Cys104 would be to protect the catalytic Cys104 from further and irreversible oxidation. Finally, we examined whether PRL-1 can be oxidized in cells exposed to H2O2. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the HA-tagged PRL-1 were incubated for 5 min with various H2O2 concentrations. Subsequently, cell lysates were fractionated using SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and the separated proteins were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Figure 7C, exposure of cells to H2O2 at concentrations as low as 100 µM led to the appearance of the higher mobility (the disulfide modified) form of PRL-1, and the intensity of the higher mobility band increased as the H2O2 concentration was raised. When the H2O2-treated cell lysates were incubated with 10 mM DTT before SDS-PAGE analysis, only

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 36, 2005 12019 the lower mobility (reduced) form of PRL-1 was detected, in accord with the notion that the higher mobility form of PRL-1 contains a disulfide bond. Consistent with our finding that the disulfide between Cys104 and Cys49 is responsible for the mobility shift of PRL-1, mutation of either Cys104 or Cys49 prevented the formation of the higher mobility band upon exposure of the cells to H2O2 (Figure 7C). Together, the data show that oxidation of PRL-1 in cells exposed to H2O2 also results in the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys104 and Cys49. In conclusion, we have determined the crystal structures of native PRL-1 at 1.9 and 3.2 Å resolution, respectively. We have also reported the crystal structure of PRL-1/C104S in complex with sulfate solved to 2.9 Å. Structural and kinetic analyses place PRL-1 in the family of dual specificity phopsphatases with closest structural similarity to the Cdc14 phosphatase, and provide a molecular basis for the extremely low activity of the PRL phosphatases toward nonspecific substrates. It is likely that significant structural rearrangements will occur upon association of the PRL phosphatases with their physiological substrates and/or activators in order to enable efficient substrate turnover. PRL-1 is found to exist as a trimer in the crystal structures, burying 1140 A2 of accessible surface area at each dimer interface. Mutation of Gly97 in the dimer interface to an Arg significantly reduces the oligomerization potential of PRL-1. Trimerization creates a large, bipartite membrane-binding surface in which the exposed C-terminal basic residues could cooperate with the adjacent prenylation group to anchor PRL-1 on the acidic inner membrane. Indeed, replacement of Lys151, Arg153, Lys155, Arg157, Arg159, and Lys161 by Ala residues completely abolished the ability of PRL-1 to bind plasma membrane. Our results indicate that localization of PRL-1 to the plasma membrane requires both insertion of the prenylation group into the lipid bilayer and ionic interactions between the C-terminal basic residues and the acidic membrane surface. Finally, the active site Cys104 is found in a disulfide linkage with a neighboring Cys49 in the native PRL-1 structures. Formation of this disulfide bond would be expected to block both substrate binding and catalysis. Biochemical studies indicate that H2O2 can promote intramolecular disulfide bond formation between Cys104 and Cys49 in solution and in the cell, which supports a potential regulatory role of Cys49 in modulating PRL-1 activity in response to reactive oxygen species.
