b-Glucosyltransferase (BGT) is a DNA-modifying enzyme encoded by bacteriophage T4 that transfers glucose from uridine diphosphoglucose to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases of phage T4 DNA. We report six X-ray structures of the substrate-free and the UDP-bound enzyme. Four also contain metal ions which activate the enzyme, including Mg2 in forms 1 and 2 and Mn2 or Ca2. The substrate-free BGT structure differs by a domain movement from one previously determined in another space group. Further domain movements are seen in the complex with UDP and the four UDP-metal complexes. Mg2, Mn2 and Ca2 bind near the b-phosphate of the nucleotide, but they occupy slightly different positions and have different ligands depending on the metal and the crystal form. Whilst the metal site observed in these complexes with the product UDP is not compatible with a role in activating glucose transfer, it approximates the position of the positive charge in the oxocarbonium ion thought to form on the glucose moiety of the substrate during catalysis.

Introduction
Glycosidic bonds are formed in huge quantities in living organisms by a large number of glycosyltranferases, each with its own sugar donor, acceptor and linkage speci®city. The diversity of enzymes re¯ects the diversity of glycan structures observed in nature.1 Glycosyltransferases have been classi®ed into 49 different families based on both sequence similarity and substrate/product stereochemistry.2 ± 4 To date, only eight crystal structures are available and one of them is the unclassi®ed b-glucosyltransferase (BGT) of the Escherichia coli T4 bacteriophage.5 ± 9 BGT transfers the glucose moiety of uridine diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) to the modi®ed cytosine bases of phage T4 double-stranded DNA, making b-glucoAbbreviations used: BGT, beta-glucosyltransferase; PEG, polyethyleneglycol; PDB, Protein Data Bank; rmsd, root-mean-square deviation; UDP, Uridine diphosphate; HMC, 5-hydroxy-methyl cytosine.

syl-5-hydroxymethyl cytosine.10 ± 12 The role of glucosylation in protecting the infecting viral DNA from host restriction enzymes has been reviewed.13 In addition, glucosylation may be implicated in the control of phage speci®c gene expression by in¯uencing transcription.14-16 BGT is a monomer of 351 amino acid residues. Its fold belongs to the a/b class and comprises two domains with a similar Rossman-like fold, separated by a deep central cleft where UDP-glucose binds. The BGT fold is similar to that of the core domain of glycogen phosphorylase.17,18 Recently, E. coli MurG and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase have been shown to have a very similar structure in spite of unrelated sequences.6,19 Thus, BGT, glycogen phosphorylase and these two enzymes represent a superfamily of glycosyltransferases.5,6,19 Bond formation by inverting glycosyltransferases is widely believed to proceed through an oxocarbonium-ion-like transition state as for glycosidases.20 ± 22 The reaction needs a general base to activate the nucleophile, which is 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (HMC) for BGT. In many cases,

570 it has also been shown to require divalent metal ions, usually Mg2 or Mn2.23 ± 25 This is the case in BGT, which requires Mg2 for full activity.12 Here, we present a crystal structure of substratefree BGT, where two previously unde®ned loops of polypeptide chain are now ordered, and comÊ pare it to a 1.9 A resolution structure of a complex with the UDP product of the reaction, and with four structures containing UDP and either Mg2, Ê Mn2 or Ca2, the last two at 1.65 A resolution. The comparison emphasises the role of domain movements closing the binding cleft on the bound nucleotide previously observed.8 All metals bind at the expected position of the oxocarbonium ion intermediate. This location, incompatible with a role in activating catalysis, suggests instead a secondary role of the metal ions in product release. The metal ions have approximate octahedral coordination, but their ligation depends on the crystal form as well as on the nature of the metal, the ligands being water molecules and either the b-phosphate of UDP or a glutamate side-chain.

Results
Domain movements in free and ligated BGT The structure of substrate-free BGT in tetragonal Ê crystals at 2.5 A resolution is shown in Figure 1. The N-terminal domain (residues 1-168) and the Cterminal domain (residues 184-315) are connected by a short linker (residues 169-183) and the long helix a12 (residues 317-335). A longer linker enables C-terminal residues 338-351 to fold back on the Nterminal domain. Two loops (residues 68-74 and 108-122) are highlighted and coloured in orange in the N-terminal domain. These loops were disordered in the previous substrate-free BGT structure, but they can be located in this new crystal form. Regions 188-195 and 215-227 of the C-terminal domain are coloured in red. They are known to undergo large conformational changes upon ligand binding.8 A structural comparison of the unligated BGT molecule in tetragonal crystals with the previously described orthorhombic form, shows an unexpectedly large conformational change that makes the new structure more open than the earlier one (Figure 2).8 The change results from a hinge movement of the two domains. The N-terminal domain is unchanged, the root-mean-square deviation Ê (rmsd) being 0.38 A for all Ca positions excluding the two disordered loops. The C-terminal domain Ê is also similar, with a Ca rmsd value of 0.65 A, but  it has rotated by 5.4 compared to the original structure. Local differences are observed in the 188-195 and 215-227 loops of the C-terminal domain, the two regions involved in substrate binding. The largest change is at residue Asn260, Ê the Ca of which moves by 4 A from one crystal form to the other, and for the side-chain of Arg191, which reorients and is implicated in crystal packing interactions.
Figure 1. Ribbon representation of substrate-free BGT. The bottom part is the N-terminal domain (residues 1168 and the C-terminal helix); two loops 68-74 and 108122, which were disordered in the previous structure, are coloured orange.8 The top part is the C-terminal domain (residues 184-315); when the nucleotide substrate binds to it, the segment in red undergoes large conformational changes. The two domains are linked by the extended segment 169-183 and by helix a12 (residues 317-335), coloured pink. This Figure and others were drawn with MOLSCRIPT and Raster3D.36,37

In contrast to the unligated protein, the BGTÊ UDP complex, described here at 1.9 A resolution, is essentially identical with a previous structure Ê solved from orthorhombic crystals at 2.3 A resolution even though the monoclinic crystal packing Ê is different.9 The rmsd is 0.28 A for all Ca positions, and the nucleotide binds at the same position in the cleft between the two domains. The ligated structures are more compact than the two unligated forms (Figure 2). In the presence of UDP, the protein adopts a closed conformation, mostly through a rigid body domain movement. The movement of the whole C-terminal domain is a 14  rotation relative to the free protein in tetragonal crystals, and 5  relative to the orthorhombic form. The hinge around which the rotation takes place approximately corresponds to residues Gln173 in the extended linker and Arg333 at the end of helix a12. Metal ligation has no effects on the overall protein structure. For two of the four metal complexes, the Mn2 complex and form 1 of the Mg2 comÊ plex, the rmsd is 0.4 A for all Ca atoms relative to

571 with the genomic phage T4* DNA as a substrate, is illustrated in Figure 3(a). Addition of 25 mM Mg2 stimulates glucose transfer at least tenfold; Ca2, Ba2, Co2 and Mn2 have comparable effects, whereas Zn2 and Cu2 do not activate BGT. The concentration for optimal activation, which is similar for Mg2 and Ca2, is in the range 20-50 mM (Figure 3(b)). In the four crystal structures of BGT-UDP-metal complexes, Mn2, Mg2 and Ca2 bind approximately in the same positions, in the cleft between the two domains and near the b-phosphate of UDP. However, signi®cant differences are seen between the four structures, even in those where the metal is the same. Mn2 Ê The 1.65 A electron density map (Figure 4(a)) shows that Mn2 interacts directly with the b-phosphate of UDP, but not with the a-phosphate or protein groups. The electron density is high and Ê the temperature factor (B-factor) of 23 A2 is consistent with full occupancy of the metal site. The coordination is octahedral, the b-phosphate oxygen O7 and ®ve water molecules being at distances of Ê 2.1-2.4 A, as usual for Mn-oxygen bonds. A sixth Ê water molecule is at 2.7 A (Table 1). Metal-bound water molecules interact with the Glu163 carboxylate, Thr99 carbonyl, Tyr261 hydroxyl, and possibly also the Asp100 carboxylate groups. As the ®rst two ligands belong to the N-terminal domain and the third to the C-terminal, the hydrated metal bridges the two halves of the protein. Mg2 form 1 Ê The 2.5 A electron density map allows the location of one Mg2 in form 1. The low B-factor of Ê the metal (10 A2) implies full occupancy. The metal position and ligands are essentially the same as for Mn2: O7 of the b-phosphate of UDP and four water molecules interacting with the Glu163 carboxylate, Thr99 carbonyl and Tyr261 hydroxyl groups (Figure 4(b) and Table 1). The apparent lack of a sixth ligand may be an artefact due to the relatively poor resolution of the diffraction data. Mg2 form 2 Form 2 is obtained under the same crystallisation conditions as form 1, but the crystal packing is Ê different and the 2.07 A electron density map indicates two bound Mg ions per protein monomer. The ®rst site is located near the UDP b-phosphate, Ê but at 1.5 A of the metal position observed in form 1 and comprises a different set of ligands: Glu163 now directly interacts with Mg2, whereas the bphosphate makes a water-mediated interaction. Five water molecules complete the octahedral coordination (Figure 4(c) and Table 1). The second coordination shell includes O7 of the b-phosphate, the Glu22 carboxylate and Thr99 hydroxyl groups.

Free BGT in tetragonal crystals is in dark blue, in orthorhombic crystals, orange. The form 2 BGT-UDP-Mg2 complex is in light blue with the metal ion drawn as a blue sphere, the monoclinic metal-free UDP-BGT complex, in red, with their UDP moieties drawn in ball-and-stick. The position of the C-terminal domain in other complexes is similar to that of metal-free UDP-BGT.

the monoclinic BGT-UDP complex. With Ca2, the Ê rmsd is larger (0.65 A) due to a local change affecting an external loop (residues 72-75). Omitting Ê these residues, the rmsd is 0.37 A, indicating that the rest of the structure is unaffected by the presence of Ca2. However, a signi®cant change is observed in form 2 of the Mg2 complex, where Ê the rmsd is near 0.6 A due to a movement of the whole C-terminal domain. It adopts an orientation intermediate between those of the binary complex and the orthorhombic forms of the unligated enzyme (Figure 2). UDP and metal binding has no effect on the N-terminal domain. In contrast, signi®cant changes take place in the C-terminal domain, where the Ca Ê rmsd is 1.15 A between the free and ligated forms of the domain. In the 188-195 and 215-240 loops, Ê the main chain moves by up to 7 A to form the nucleotide binding site, bringing critical residues in contact with the nucleotide. Thus, Ser189, Arg191 and Arg195 move to interact with the pyrophosphate moiety and Ile238 with the uridine base. These movements, which have been described, are also observed in the metal complexes.8 The same protein groups, all from the C-terminal domain, are involved in interactions with the nucleotide in all these complexes. Those interacting with the pyrophosphate moiety of UDP, mostly the main-chain NH of Ser189 and the guanidinium groups of the three arginine residues in position 191, 195 and 269, are listed in Table 1.

Ê In addition, the high B-factor of the metal (50 A2 with a full occupancy) suggests that this site is not fully occupied. A second Mg2 binds to the carboxylate of Glu305 and to four water molecules. Glu305 belongs to helix a11 and is far removed from the active site. In form 1, a crystal contact forbids metal binding to Glu305. Ca2 Ê The electron density map, also at 1.65 A, suggests that the metal site near the b-phosphate of UDP is incompletely occupied at 20 mM Ca2, the concentration used for co-crystallisation. This is the minimum value of the optimum value of 2050 mM for activity, but the solubility is limited under the crystallisation conditions. The B-factor of Ê the metal ion re®ned to 39 A2 when 50 % occupancy was assumed. The metal interacts with O7 of the b-phosphate and two water molecules bound to Glu22, Glu163 and Asp100 (Table 1). The presence of other ligands, presumably also water molecules, is not obvious in the electron density map despite the high resolution, possibly due to the low metal occupancy. In line with the assumed 50 % metal occupancy, we observe that the sidechain of Glu163 takes two alternative positions

with similar occupancies, one making the watermediated interaction with the metal, the other pointing away from it.

UDP The presence and nature of the metal has no apparent effect on the conformation of the bound UDP nucleotide, which is the same in the metalfree and the four metal complexes. An exception is form 1 of the Mg2 complex, where the b-phosphate rotates by 10  and accepts a H-bond from Ê the Tyr261 hydroxyl (Table 1). A small shift (1 A) of the Tyr261 side-chain is observed compared to the other ®ve complexes. The presence of the metal affects few other side-chains. The two positions of the Glu163 side-chain seen in the Ca2 complex correspond to both the conformation seen in the presence of Mn2 or Mg2, and in the metal-free BGT-UDP complexes. The rotation of this sidechain is coupled with that of Gln137, which is in contact with Glu163. The Glu22 side-chain occupies a different position in the metal-free versus the metal-ligated complexes, where it makes water-mediated metal interactions.

Discussion
The substrate-induced domain movement that closes the active site cleft of BGT onto the bound nucleotide has been illustrated by a comparison of free and UDP-bound structures.8 The set of structures described here demonstrates that movements of the same nature and large amplitude can take place both in the free protein and in complexes with the nucleotide and metal ions. Thus, domain

movements in BGT involve small changes in conformational (free) energies, comparable to the crystal packing energies. The most revealing example is that of the two crystal forms of the BGT-UDPMg2 complex, which shows the domains in slightly different positions under the same experimental conditions. It is likely that the hinge connection between the N and C-terminal domains is highly ¯exible in unligated BGT and retains ¯exi-

bility after the nucleotide binds. Further changes are likely to take place in the presence of DNA. In contrast to nucleotide binding, divalent metal ions have no effect on the overall protein conformation. However, the type of metal ligation described here is unusual. In most nucleoside dior triphosphate-containing enzymes, including several glycosyltransferases, Mg2 or Mn2 ligates the a and b-phosphate groups and has additional ligands from the protein.26 ± 28 The metal cofactor is believed to neutralise their negative charges. In glycosyltransferases, it facilitates cleavage of the UDP-sugar linkage and stabilises the leaving group.24,25 The former role may be not required at

the BGT active site, where three arginine residues interact with the pyrophosphate moiety of UDP and the net charge is zero. Upon UDP leaving, an additional negative charge develops on the b-phosphate. In the Mn2 and form 1 Mg2 complexes, the metal ion ligates oxygen O7 of the b-phosphate and could contribute to catalysis by neutralising its developing charge. However, the metal position observed here in complexes with the UDP product is unlikely to be used when the substrate UDP-glucose binds, for the sugar moiety attached to oxygen O7 of the bphosphate should ®ll the space occupied by the metal. Thus, the divalent metal position in the

They belong to space group P41 with the cell parameters given in Table 2. Crystallisation of ligated BGT was performed from solutions containing 1 mM UDP and PEG 4000.9 Monoclinic crystals grew in hanging drops containing 10-11 % PEG 4000, 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and 1 mM UDP over wells containing 20-22 % PEG 4000 in the same buffer. They belong to space group P21 with the cell parameters given in Table 2. Under the same conditions, a ®nal concentration of 40 mM MgCl2 in the drop solutions yielded two different orthorhombic crystal forms growing together, both in space group P212121 (form 1 and form 2). Form 1 was also obtained with a ®nal concentration of 20 mM MnCl2, whereas the same concentration of CaCl2 yielded crystals in space group P21 with cell parameters similar to those of the metal-free UDP complex. All data collection experiments were carried out Ê at l  0.934 A on station ID14-H1 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble). Data were taken at 100 K on MarResearch CCD detectors, using a single crystal for each set. Cryo-protectant conditions were achieved by transfering crystals in a loop to a solution containing the mother liquor and 20-25 % (v/v) glycerol. Diffracted intensities were evaluated with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK and further processed using the CCP4 program suite.30,31 Overall statistics are given in Table 2. Crystal structure determination and refinement None of the crystal forms is isomorphous to those preÂ viously reported by Vrielink et al. and Morera et al.8,9

BGT-product complexes appears to be incompatible with substrate binding. On the other hand, it is very similar to that described in the SpsA glycosyltransferase in complex with UDP-Mn2 or UDPMg2.26 The authors suggest that this is the position occupied by the positive charge of the oxocarbonium ion forming in the transition state, and this interpretation would also apply to BGT. Molecular modeling based on the structure of the metal-free complex with UDP suggested two possible posÂra itions for glucose. One of them (mode B, More et al.9) assumed a movement of the b-phosphate. It is compatible with the position of the Glu163 sidechain in the metal-free complexes, but con¯icts with the one seen in the presence of metal ions. The other mode, which had the lowest conformational energy, is compatible with both. The ®nding that the conformation of UDP is very similar in six structures, two without and four with metal ions, argues in favour of this second mode.

Thus, the structures were solved by molecular replacement as implemented in program AMoRe.32 Rotation/ translation searches were carried out using the BGT Â model described by Morera et al. as a search model.9 A unique solution was obtained for each form and initial phases were calculated with this solution. Subsequent electron density maps were examined using TurboFRODO.33 With BGT-UDP complexes, the ®rst 2Fo À Fc electron density showed clear density for both the protein and the nucleotide in each case, and only minor modi®cations of the protein structure were required. In contrast, the substrate-free protein in tetragonal crystals needed extensive manual rebuilding. Water molecules were gradually added during further conjugate gradient re®nement with CNS.34 Statistics for the six re®ned models are given in Table 2. They have R-factors in the range 18-21 % (Rfree 21-27 %) at resolutions in the range Ê 1.65-2.5 A and excellent stereochemistry. Enzymatic activity The metal dependence of the enzymatic activity was measured with phage T4 DNA as a substrate. The glucosylation of 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (HMC) was monitored via the transfer of [14C]glucose incorporated into unglucosylated T4* DNA. In contrast to T4 wild-type DNA, T4* DNA remains unglucosylated during phage replication in UDPG* host cells.35 The incubation mixture (®nal volume of 100 ml) contained 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 9 mg of T4* DNA, 0.5 mg of BGT, 200 mM UDPG (Sigma), 5 ml of [14C]UDPG (NEN, 330mCi/mmol or 1.85 MBq) and 25 mM different divalent metal ions. BGT activity was also measured in Mg2 and Ca2 concentrations in the range 10À6-0.2 M. After 15 minutes of incubation at 30  C, the reaction assays were transferred onto DEAE ®lter disks (Whatman DE81). To remove free UDPG, ®lters were washed three times with 5 ml of 0.5 M NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.0), dried and counted in a Beckman scintillation counter, model LS 6000 TA. Data Bank accession codes The coordinates of the apo BGT, UDP-BGT, UDP-BGT Mn2, UDP-BHT-Ca2, form 1 UDP-BGT-Mg2 and form 2 UDP-BGT-Mg2 complexes have been deposited in the RCSB under accession codes 1JEJ, 1JG6, 1JG7, 1JIX, 1JIU and 1JIV, respectively. 13. 14. 15.
