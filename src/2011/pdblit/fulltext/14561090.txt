Inhibition of the biosynthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 via p38 has been an approach toward the development of a disease modifying agent for the treatment of chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases. The development of a new core structure of p38 inhibitors, 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-b] pyridine, is described. X-ray crystallographic data of the lead bound to the active site of p38 was used to guide the optimization of the series. Specific focus was placed on modulating the physical properties of the core while maintaining potent inhibition of p38. These efforts identified 42c as a potent inhibitor of p38, which also possessed the required physical properties worthy of advanced studies.
Introduction It is now known that the regulation of cytokine biosynthesis, including the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor-R (TNFR),1 in various cell types is regulated through activation of p38 MAP kinase. Both TNFR and IL-1 are implicated in the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in the progression of bone and joint destruction associated with RA.2 Recent human clinical trials using IL-1ra (kineret), the natural receptor antagonist of IL-1 , and the biologic TNFR inhibitors (infliximab and etanercept) have clinically validated that modulation of these cytokines leads to dramatic improvement in inflammatory diseases such as RA and Crohn's disease.3 Development of an orally active small molecule inhibitor of p38 is of extreme interest and is the focus of many pharmaceutical research programs.4 SmithKline Beecham's pioneering series of p38 inhibitors, pyridinylimidazoles, has been well documented in the literature and shown to be effective in inhibiting bone resorption, inflammation, delayed type hypersensitivity, as well as other immune and inflammatory based pathologies.6,7 In this report, we describe one of the initial approaches toward developing novel proprietary leads in our p38 program based on structure guided design. An X-ray crystal structure of native unphosphorylated p38 MAP kinase was solved in-house as well as complexes with early diarylimidazole p38 inhibitors from SKB (SK&F86002) (Figure 1). The mode of binding of this class has now been well documented in the literature.7 These inhibitors make

optimal interactions through their 4-pyridyl moiety (hydrogen bond with the main chain NH of Met 109), the 4-fluorophenyl group that optimally fills a hydrophobic pocket (partly created by specificity residue Thr 106 in p38) and the nitrogen of the central imidazole ring with the terminal nitrogen of Lys 53.8,9 Published structures within the diaryl imidazole class of inhibitors in which the hydrogen bond to Lys 53 has been observed10 suggest this interaction is required for the regioselective positioning of the pyridyl and the 4-fluorophenyl groups. As this Lys is a highly conserved ATPbinding residue,11 targeting this interaction is unlikely to contribute to inhibitor selectivity; however, interactions with this Lys offer an opportunity to enhance the intrinsic potency of kinase inhibitors. We reasoned that an azaindole ring could incorporate a basic nitrogen within direct hydrogen binding distance to Lys 53 and serve as a suitable scaffold. 4-Azaindole 9 was synthesized, and the X-ray crystal structure of this compound bound to unphosphorylated p38 confirmed the direct hydrogen bonding distance of 2.8 Å (heteroatom to heteroatom) between the 4-indole nitrogen and the Lys 53 (Figure 3A). In this structure, Lys 53 maintains its hydrogen bond interaction with Glu 71. Compounds in the 4-azaindole class are extremely potent with IC50's in the low nanomolar range. Our lead compound 9 has an IC50 ) 6 nM (compared with IC50 ) 400 nM of SK&F86002). However, compound 9 was highly crystalline and poorly soluble. To optimize the physical properties of the series, as well as the bioavailability of our lead, a number of

azaindole template derivatives were synthesized for evaluation as listed in Figure 2. Chemistry. Two synthetic routes to the 4-azaindole scaffold were developed. In the first (Scheme 1), the anion of ketone 2 was treated with 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine to afford the desired adduct 3 in reasonable yield. Reduction of the nitro group under various conditions including hydrogenation, tin chloride, titanium trichloride, and sodium dithionite resulted in cyclization of the intermediate N-hydroxylamine to the N-hydroxy 4-aza-

Conversion of the ketone 3 to the enol triflate 4 prior to nitro reduction still resulted in N-hydroxyazaindole 5 upon reduction of the nitro group. Compound 9 was readily obtained by the second route shown in Scheme 2. Ketone 2 was converted to a mixture of imine-enamine 7-8 via condensation with

3-amino-2-chloropyridine with azeotropic removal of water. The desired indole was then formed via an intramolecular Heck reaction in extremely high yield.12 Direct alkylation of indoles 5 and 9 with the corresponding alkyl halides or diazomethane gave the desired derivatives 6 and 10. The general approach for 5-azaindole 15 and indole 19 is outlined in Schemes 3 and 4. 4-(Pivaloylamino) pyridine 11 was ortho lithiated using reported conditions14 and was subsequently trapped with commercially available 4-fluoro-N-methoxy-N-methyl benzamide to give adduct 13. Treatment with isonicotinoyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of pyridine afforded the oxoamide 14, which was then subjected to reductive coupling with TiCl3/Mg under the "instant method conditions" described by Fustner et al.15 to yield 5-azaindole 15. Indoles 19a-c were prepared in similar fashion. Both 4,7-diazaindole and 4,6-diazaindole derivatives were prepared by Fisher indole reactions.15 The 4,7diazaindoles 22 (Scheme 5) will be described in greater detail in a separate paper.16 The preparation of 4,6-diazaindole 24 is outlined in Scheme 6. Ketone 2 was converted to its hydrazone 23 using standard conditions. The hydrazone 23 was then coupled with 5-bromopyrimidine via palladium catalysis using conditions initially described by Hartwig.17 The construction of 7-amino-4,6-diazaindole 29 involved the bromination of 4-acetyl pyridine 25 with

bromine and HBr18 followed by nucleophilic substitution with malononitrile. This reaction proved to be difficult and after experimenting with various conditions, and sodium hydroxide as base in ethanol gave the best results. Condensation of 27 with 4-fluoroaniline under acidic conditions afforded 28. Subsequent treatment of 28 with formamide using literature conditions19 gave the desired product 29 (Scheme 7). The 4-azabenzofuran template was synthesized starting from esterification of commercial 5-hydroxypicolinic

acid followed by protection of the phenol as the tertbutyldimethylsilyl ether.20 Treatment of the ester with 4-fluoromagnesium bromide afforded ketone 31 in good yield. Removal of the silyl protecting group, 20 subsequent reaction with ethyl bromoacetate, and cyclization to the benzofuran 33 were accomplished using literature conditions.21 Decarboxylation22 followed by formation of the tributylstannane using known procedures23 gave adduct 34. The installation of the 4-pyridyl ring was completed using Stille conditions24 and gave the desired 4-azabenzofuran 35 (Scheme 8). Although the preparation of this compound could be envisaged using reductive coupling with TiCl3/Zn, we thought the stannane coupling reaction used in the last step would allow for ready variation of the pyridyl group. Our initial route to 4-azaindole (Scheme 2) did not allow for derivation of the 2-pyridyl ring; therefore, the synthesis was modified to incorporate a masked chloropyridine via N-oxide 36. Ketone 2 was oxidized with methyltrioxorhenium25 to afford N-oxide 36 in good yield. However, subsequent condensation with 3-amino2-chloropyridine under a variety of conditions gave adduct 39 in poor yields due to thermal decomposition of the product. Dramatic increases in yield was accomplished by prior conversion of the ketone to the dimethyl acetal 3826 which could then undergo condensation with 3-amino-2-chloropyridine at lower temperature to give 39. Intramolecular Heck reaction using DABCO as base in DMF gave 40 in moderate yield. Further improvement in yield was achieved using DIPEA in propionitrile. The requisite chloride in compound 41 was formed via treatment of N-oxide 40 with phosphorus oxychloride. Nucleophilic displacement of the chloride with the desired alkylamine afforded the amino substituted 4-azaindoles 42 (Scheme 9). Results and Discussion The 4-azaindole class of inhibitors bind to both p38 R and p38 isoforms as well as to both the activated and unactivated form of p38 R as reported with similar diaryl heterocyclic classes of p38 inhibitors.6 These compounds do not inhibit either p38  or p38  isoforms. 28 The  and  isoforms have a larger Met residue at position 106, whereas the R and isoforms have a smaller Thr at this position. It is thought that Met side-chain blocks access to the hydrophobic pocket

occupied by the 4-fluorophenyl group of the azaindole inhibitors, and hence the inhibitors are not effective against the  and  isoforms. To optimize our lead, we investigated a number of heterocyclic derivatives of the 4-azaindole template (Table 1). Compounds 15 and 19a, both lacking the 4-indole nitrogen, illustrate the importance of the direct hydrogen bond interaction between the nitrogen of the 4-azaindole ring and Lys 53. In the crystal structure of 5-azaindole 15 bound to unphosphorylated p38 enzyme, the distance between the nitrogen of Lys 53 and the nitrogen of the 5-azaindole ring is 4.3 Å, as compared with 2.8 Å in the 4-azaindole 9 structure (Figure 3B). Presumably, the loss of this hydrogen bond interaction explains the dramatic loss in potency (400-fold). Similarly, absence of nitrogen altogether decreases inhibition as is shown with indole 19a. Compounds 22 and 35 maintain the same regioselective positioning of the pyridyl, 4-fluorophenyl rings and the 4-nitrogen of the indole ring. The loss in potency, however, may be explained by the reduced electron density of the 4-nitrogen in these heterocyclic systems relative to compound 9. Finally, compounds 24 and 29 show a dramatic loss in potency perhaps due to a combination of reduced electron density on the 4-nitrogen as well as potential repulsive interactions between the enzyme and the 6-azaindole nitrogen. On the basis of these results, we primarily focused on the optimization of 4-azaindole series. The initial 4-azaindole lead 9, while being a potent inhibitor of p38 kinase with an IC50 of 6 nM, is a crystalline solid with a high melting point (>285 °C as the free base) and poor aqueous solubility (only 80 µg/mL as the HCl salt). We reasoned that substitution of the indole nitrogen would reduce the crystallinity of the template, and thus a number of derivatives were synthesized to optimize the physical properties of the series while attempting to maintain intrinsic potency. (Table 2). The X-ray structure revealed that substitution at the indole nitrogen would be well tolerated as this position is solvent accessible and does not interact directly with the protein. However, a clear preference for small alkyl substituents is evident from the data (Table 2). Small neutral alkyl groups such as ethyl 10b and methoxyethyl 10a are best tolerated relative to the unsubstituted indole 9. Attempts to further increase solubility with attachment of basic amines via an alkyl linker resulted in even greater loss of potency 10e-g. Subsequent X-ray structures revealed that substituted alkyl derivatives such as morpholino ethyl 10e preferred to displace the methionine 109 side chain and increase hydrophobic contacts with the hinge portion of p38 (perhaps explaining the preference for strictly hydrophobic moieties at this position). While the crystal structure reveals hydrophobic interactions between the morpholine ring of 10e and the enzyme, significant desolvation penalty likely explains the lower intrinsic potency of this and similar analogues. Additionally, installation of acidic functionality at different distances from the indole templates was not at all tolerated, i.e., 10h. While some intrinsic potency was lost with Nalkylation, the dramatic reduction in crystallinity more than compensated for this loss and in vivo efficacy was

established in this series (Table 3) in a rat model of LPSstimulated TNFR synthesis. While in vivo efficacy was initially established with this template, the compounds in this series were prone to rather high metabolic clearance rates. In vitro studies with hepatic microsomal protein identified three sites of oxidative metabolism of azaindole 9. The 4-pyridyl nitrogen 43 and the 4-azaindole nitrogen 44 were the major sites of metabolic transformation (confirmed by

independent synthesis) and hydroxylation of the 6-position of the azaindole ring 45 was observed as a minor in vitro metabolite (Scheme 10). Metabolites 43 and 44 were significantly less active (IC50 ) 2.5 and 6.7 µM respectively), consistent with the binding mode idente, and synthetic focus was concentrated on substitution of the pyridyl ring at the ortho position to the nitrogen. We postulated that steric hindrance may reduce the rate of N-oxide formation. The X-ray crystal structures suggested that monosubstituted amines could be toler-

of variants of the 4-azaindole were synthesized; however, none were identified to be as potent as this core scaffold. Attempts to improve the potency and physical properties of the lead 9 via alkylation of the indole nitrogen successfully identified derivatives with both in vitro and in vivo efficacy. Unfortunately, these analogues suffered from high rates of oxidative metabolic clearance directed principally at the pyridine ring. The X-ray crystal structure provided insight into the design of well-tolerated substituted pyridine derivatives which provided steric bulk around the pyridine nitrogen. Compound 42b was identified as a potent, selective orally bioavailable inhibitor of p38 which possessed desirable physical properties. Experimental Section
Reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. Flash chromatography was performed with Merck silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh), and reaction progress was determined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using Analtec 250-µm silica gel plates. Visualization was done with UV light (254 nm) or iodine. Yields are of purified compounds and were not optimized. 1H NMR measurements were recorded at 75.40 MHz using a Bruker AMX 300 instrument in DMSO with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Melting points recorded were uncorrected. Elemental analyses were within (0.4% except for compound 19a for which carbon and nitrogen analysis exhibits (0.46 and (0.45% errors and 24 for which hydrogen analysis exhibits (0.47% error. Purity of compounds 43 and 44 was determined using a Micromass Platform LC, single quadruple mass spectrometer with a electrospray (ES) probe using a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water with 0.1% TFA.

Sodium metal (5.06 g, 210 mmol) was dissolved in absolute ethanol (150 mL), and then a solution of methyl isonicotinate (20.55 g, 150 mmol) and 4-fluorophenylacetonitrile (20.25 g, 150 mmol) in absolute ethanol (50 mL) was added in one portion. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 3 h and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was poured into ice water (300 mL), and the pH was adjusted to 3 with 10% hydrochloric acid. The yellow precipitate was filtered and dried in vacuo to give 24 g of cyano ketone. This material was suspended in 48% hydrobromic acid (90 mL) and heated to reflux. After 8 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and carefully poured into ice water (300 mL). The pH was adjusted to 7-8 with ammonium hydroxide. The product was extracted into ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4 and concentration in vacuo to give 1-(pyridin-4-yl)-2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethanone (11.8 g) as a tan solid.1H NMR (DMSO-d6) d: 4.26 (s, 2 H) 7.04 (t, J ) 8.67 Hz, 2 H), 7.21 (dd, J ) 8.72 Hz, J ) 5.31 Hz, 2 H), 7.17 (dd, J ) 4.42 Hz, J ) 1.68 Hz, 2 H), 8.81 (dd, J ) 4.43 Hz, J ) 1.67 Hz, 2 H).

The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for an hour. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (100 mL) and the product extracted into ethyl acetate (2 × 100 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo to give a dark brown oil. Purification by flash column chromatography (10 to 50% ethyl acetate/ hexanes) gave 1-(pyridin-4-yl)-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(3-nitro-2-pyridyl) ethanone as a brown oil (4.08 g).

ated next to the pyridyl nitrogen atom and perhaps form a bidentate hydrogen bonding motif with Met 109.8,9 Mono hydroxyalkylamine derivatives were potent inhibitors of p38 both in vitro and in vivo. Optimal potency was achieved when the hydroxyl group was located two carbons from the exocyclic amine. The chirality of the hydroxyl group did not alter the intrinsic potency of the inhibitor (42b vs 42c, Table 4). Differences in plasma exposure in rodents, however, between the enantiomers were observed. Compound 42b had greater plasma exposure (higher Cmax and AUC) than compound 42c (Table 5). Compound 42b was evaluated for kinase selectivity against a panel of related enzymes including ERK and JNK-1 and was quite selective for p38 MAP kinase (Table 7). On the basis of these results, and the desirable drug-like physical properties (Table 6) of 42b, this inhibitor was selected for advanced preclinical evaluation. In conclusion, a novel scaffold for inhibition of p38 MAP kinase was identified by exploiting the hydrogen bond to Lys 53 using structure guided design. A number

Column elution was accomplished with a 30 columnvolume gradient from 0 to 400 mM NaCl in the same buffer. p38 eluted in two peaks with only the first peak showing monodisperse behavior by light scattering. The first peak was concentrated in an Amicon Stirrer cell and YM30 membrane to 2 mg/mL. The protein was then diluted 50-fold with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM DTT and concentrated again to final concentration of 50 mg/mL. The concentrated protein was frozen in 50 µL aliquots using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Reproducible protein crystallization was achieved at 17 °C with crystal micro seeding; hanging drops consisted of a 1 to 1 mixture of 32 mg/mL protein and mother liquor, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 50 mM CaCl2, and 17% PEG 3350. Single crystals were transferred into mother liquor baths containing 10-100 µM inhibitor for 8-24 h. The soaked crystals were briefly exposed to cryosolvent (24% glycerol, 17% Peg 3350) and mounted into a liquid nitrogen stream for data collection at -180 °C. p38 crystallized in space group P212121 as reported previously.10 Structure solution via molecular replacement was straightforward. For the complex between p38 and 5, refinement against 2.1 Å data was performed using XPLOR and REFMAC5.28 The final working R-factor was 20.1%, and the free R-factor was 25.1%. Details of the data collection methods and statistics are reported along with the deposited structure coordinates as entry 1OZ1 in the Protein Data Bank.29 Biological methods. p38 MAP kinase Inhibition. In Vitro Assay. Inhibition of human recombinant active p38R [5 nM] was tested by measuring the incorporation of 33P from -[33P]ATP [50 µM, 1 µCi] into myelin basic protein (MBP) [35 µM]. The assay was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate. In 40 µL reaction volume, 26 µL diluted p38R [5 nM] in assay dilution buffer (ADB) (20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, 40 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM -glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) were preincubated at room temperature for 10 min with 4 µL of test compounds [0-10 µM], dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) [10%]. The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 µL of assay mix, containing ADB and -[33P]ATP [50 µM, 1 µCi] and MBP [35 µM]. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by the removal of 25 µL of reaction sample onto 200 µL of 0.75% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) containing, acid prewetted Multiscreen 96-well phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore). The plate membranes were washed three times with 200 µL of 0.75% H3PO4 for the removal of the free radionucleotide. Fifty microliters of Microscint-20 scintillant (Packard) was added to each well, the plate sealed with plastic film, and counted in a Packard Topcount microplate scintillation counter. 50% inhibitory value was calculated by fitting the data to the equation:

Trejo et al. were prepared as stock solutions in DMSO (6 mM). Six subsequent 3-fold serial dilutions are performed in DMSO to create a compound concentration curve. Dilute samples 1/20 in RPMI to reduce DMSO concentration. Twenty-five microliter aliquots of each concentration were dispensed in triplicate to a 96-well plate. A total of 200 µL of human whole blood was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Twenty-five microliters of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli 0127; B8, Cat. No. L3129, Sigma Chem Co) dissolved in tissue culture media to yield a final concentration of 0.5 µg/mL was added to all wells except media control wells. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The plates were centrifuged and plasma was collected and stored in polypropylene plates. IL-1 specific ELISA (Antibody Solutions, Palo Alto, CA) was performed according to manufacturer's specifications immediately or samples were stored at 4 °C until analyzed. Rat LPS Assay. Female Wistar/Han (CRL:WI) Rats (Charles River, Hollister, CA) were acclimated for at least one week. At -30 min, groups containing 8 rats each were dosed orally either with the test compounds in an aqueous vehicle containing 0.9% sodium chloride, 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, 0.4% polysorbate 80, 0.9% benzyl alcohol (CMC vehicle) or with vehicle only (control group). At 0 h, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with 50 µg/kg of LPS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After 1.5 h, the rats were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, and blood was drawn by cardiocentesis and subsequently separated by centrifugation at 15600g for 5 min. Serum TNFR was quantified using a ELISA kit (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA.) Rat Phamacokinetic Study. Female Wistar/Han (CRL: WI) Rats (Charles River, Hollister, CA) weighing between 180 and 220 g were used. Animals were allowed free access to a standard laboratory chow and tap water, and were housed in a constant temperature-humidity environment. Three rats per dose regime were administered either single 10 mg/kg IV bolus doses (50% cyclodextran/water) or single 10 mg/kg oral suspension doses prepared in aqueous vehicle containing 0.9% NaCl, 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.4% polysorbate 80 and 0.9% benzyl alcohol. Blood was collected from each rat anesthetized with CO2:O2 (60:40) via the orbital sinus or cardiac puncture at 1, 3, 6, 8, and 24 h after dosing. Plasma levels of test compounds were assayed by a LC/MS method. In this method, an aliquot of plasma was treated by mixing with actonitrile to precipitate protein, centrifuged to clarify the supernatant, then further diluted with formate buffer (50 mM), and injected onto an HPLC. Test compounds were separated from endogenous interfering substances and subsequently eluted from the HPLC column for mass spectrometric quantification. Microsomal Incubations. Nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent transformation was studied with concentrations of 100 µM of test compound. Incubations were conducted at 37 °C, and contained 2 mg/mL of liver microsomal protein in pH 7.4, 40 mM phosphate buffer containing 3 mM magnesium chloride and 1.0 mM NADPH. Aliquots of the incubations were taken at specific time points over a 30 min incubation period. To stop the reaction the timed aliquots were added to an equal volume of acetonitrile containing an internal standard (IS). The IS-acetonitrile solution denatured and precipitated the microsomal protein. The protein was separated by centrifugation and an aliquot of the resultant supernatants were assayed by a HPLC/UV method. Incubations prepared without the addition of NADPH acted as controls.

Induction of TNF Biosynthesis. THP-1 cells were suspended in culture medium [RPMI (Gibco-BRL, Gailthersburg, MD) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.02 mM 2-mercaptoethanol], at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/mL and then plated in 96-well plates (0.2 mL aliquots in each well). Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted with the culture medium such that the final DMSO concentration was 5%. Twenty-five microliter aliquots of test solution or only medium with DMSO (control) were added to each well. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. LPS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the wells at a final concentration of 0.5 µg/mL, and cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. At the end of the incubation period, culture supernatants were collected and the amount of TNFR present was determined by a specific trapping ELISA assay using two anti-TNFR antibodies (2TNF-H22 and 2TNF-H34) as described.30 Human blood from volunteer donors who are medicationfree for at least 14 days was collected into siliconized vacutainers containing heparin (19 units/mL).
