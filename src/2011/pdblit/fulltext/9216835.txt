A series of HIV protease inhibitors containing a novel (hydroxyethyl)amidosuccinoyl core has been synthesized. These peptidomimetic structures inhibit viral protease activity at low nanomolar concentrations (IC50 < 10 nM for HIV-1 protease). The inhibition constant (Ki) for inhibitor 19 was determined to be 7.5 pM against HIV-1 and 1.2 nM against HIV-2 proteases, respectively. Several compounds (19-24) inhibited HIV-1 replication in cell culture assays with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) ) 3.7-35 nM. This series of inhibitors was found to exhibit poor bioavailability (<10%) in the rat, following oral administration. The synthesis and biological properties of these compounds are discussed. In addition, an X-ray structure of one of these inhibitors (23) in complex with HIV-2 protease provides insight into the binding mode of this novel class of HIV protease inhibitors.
Introduction The past decade has seen full realization of the World Health Organization's predictions concerning the catastrophic dimensions of the epidemic associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. It has been estimated that in addition to the 4.5 million adults which have already died from HIV-associated conditions, 21 million adults worldwide are currently suffering from HIV/AIDS infection.1 The magnitude of this tragedy has triggered an unprecedented effort in the search for a possible cure to the deadly disease. Studies on the life cycle of the virus have identified several areas for therapeutic intervention.2 Most widely studied, nucleoside as well as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors offered the first hope for increasing life expectancy in patients afflicted by the infection.3 Unfortunately, emergence of viral resistance coupled with serious side effects associated with the use of some nucleoside RT inhibitors has resulted in only marginal success in combating disease progression.4a More recently, combinations of nucleoside RT inhibitors as well as combinations of RT inhibitors and nevirapine (the first approved non-nucleoside RT inhibitor) have proven superior to monotherapies in delaying advancement of the disease.4b,c Another essential protein in the virus life cycle is the HIV protease. It is responsible for the processing of encoded gag and gag-pol gene products. Cleavage by the protease of these polyproteins at specific sites generates the proteins and enzymes required for viral maturation.5 The discovery that inhibition of the protease resulted in the production of noninfectious, immature virions6 triggered extensive efforts in the search for agents capable of interfering with this enzyme, thereby inhibiting viral replication.7 As a member of the aspartyl protease class of enzymes,8 HIV protease is susceptible to inhibition by peptide-like structures

incorporating various isosteres that mimic the hydrolysis transition state of an amide bond.2,7 Among them, hydroxyethylamine (HEA)-based structures (Figure 1) have led to extremely potent inhibitors of the enzyme.9 Originally, the highly peptidic nature of these HIV protease inhibitors resulted in poor oral bioavailability and short half-lives in vivo, thus jeopardizing their use as therapeutic agents.2 However, manipulation of physicochemical properties (hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, charge), reduction in size, elimination of peptide bonds, and formulation have led to compounds with enhanced oral absorption, allowing their advancement into clinical trials. Recently, HIV protease inhibitors have been shown to effectively reduce viral load in infected patients and are providing clinicians with new tools for AIDS chemotherapy.10 Our laboratory has been actively involved in the synthesis and evaluation of HIV protease inhibitors.9g,h Palinavir (Figure 2) is a highly potent and specific inhibitor of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. It is also effective against viral replication in cell culture assays (Table 1).9h,11 The chemical structure of palinavir is characterized by a hydroxyethylamine transition state mimic with the (R)-configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group12 and a novel 4-substituted pipecolic amide entity.13 While studies on this novel class of inhibitors were being pursued toward the selection of a candidate for development, we also desired a backup series whose structural features would be significantly different from those of our lead compound. We describe herein the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel class of highly potent HIV protease inhibitors incorporating a (hydroxyethyl)amidosuccinoyl motif.14 Results and Discussion SAR Studies. In our search for a backup to the pipecolic amide series of inhibitors (as represented by palinavir, Figure 2), we hoped that modifications which substantially altered overall physicochemical properties, while retaining both enzymatic and antiviral inhibitory

potencies, would translate into beneficial pharmacokinetic effects (oral absorption, sustained duration of action, longer half-lives). In recent years, the (R)-hydroxyethylamine dipeptide insert was incorporated as a key component in highly potent peptidomimetic inhibitors of HIV protease. Saquinavir9b and palinavir9h are examples of compounds which contain a basic nitrogen atom. The (R)-HEA unit has also appeared in neutral derivatives such as ureas15 and sulfonamides.16 To our knowledge, however, there are only two isolated reports of inhibitors based on elaboration of this unit via an amide linkage, forming a hydroxyethylamide transition state mimic (Figure 1).17 In designing a backup series of inhibitors, we not only desired structural novelty, but also reduced synthetic complexity. Pipecolic amide derivative 1 (Table 2),9h a trimmed-down version of our lead series (palinavir, Figure 2), was selected as a starting point for the development of a novel class of inhibitors. Removal of the substituent in the 4-position of the pipecolic ring of palinavir results in a substantial decrease in potency, and the carbobenzyloxy N-terminus is not optimal for binding in the S3 subsite of the enzyme.9b Still, compound 1 retained sufficient potency in our enzymatic assay (IC50 ) 62 nM)18 to be used as a reference point. We anticipated that replacement of the pipecolic amide portion of 1 by a 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid would not alter drastically the overall interactions between the enzyme and inhibitor. Indeed, this succinic acid derivative 2, prepared as a 1:1 mixture of cis-isomers inhibited activity of HIV-1 protease to a similar extent (IC50 ) 140 nM). Novel succinic diamide derivative 2 satisfied our initial criteria of structural novelty, ease of synthesis, and altered physicochemical properties (the basic pipecolic ring nitrogen in 1 now exists as a neutral amide nitrogen). Efforts were then directed at improving potency by optimizing interactions between the inhibitor and the enzyme. Our past experience in the field of peptidomimetics19 suggested that the role of the cyclohexane ring in 2 might be one of orienting the backbone of the inhibitor

toward a bioactive conformation. Such an effect can be achieved through conformational rigidification (such as for compound 2) or by attachment of bulky alkyl groups at strategic locations along the inhibitor backbone. Replacement of the 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic moiety by a tert-butylsuccinic fragment gave compounds 3-6 (Table 2). As can be seen from the data in Table 2, the ability of the compounds to inhibit HIV protease varies drastically depending on the position and orientation of the tert-butyl group. Isomer 3 with the tert-butyl substituent on the carbon to the tert-butylamide group ((R)-configuration) showed the highest potency (IC50 ) 3.0 nM). All other isomers (4-6) were 8-1600 times less potent. Several other alkyl substituents were examined in place of the tert-butyl group, using 3 as a reference point (e.g. isopropyl, phenyl, cyclohexyl, neopentyl; data not shown). None proved as effective as our original choice. The optimal effect observed in the case of the bulkier tert-butyl group with a (R)-configuration at the point of attachment can be a consequence

of its greater ability to direct the inhibitor backbone toward a bioactive conformation or to a favorable lipophilic interaction of the tert-butyl group itself with the enzyme active site (or a combination of both). Removal of this tert-butyl group (entry 7) resulted in a dramatic 2750-fold drop in potency. Some insight on the mode of binding of these inhibitors was gained with the help of an X-ray crystal structure of a complex with HIV-2 protease and will be discussed in a separate section. Inhibitors have been known to bind to the protease with either of two possible configurations of the critical hydroxyl group in the transition state mimic.20 In view of the structural uniqueness of our succinic series, we verified that the (R)-configuration at that center was optimal. The (S)-epimer (compound 8) was prepared and showed a 17-fold loss in potency relative to 3 (examination of the crystal structure clearly suggests that this configuration will not position the hydroxyl group for optimal H-bonding to the catalytic Asp residues, and hence, there should be a drop in potency). Our initial SAR studies had quickly identified a novel (R)-hydroxyethylamidosuccinoyl peptidomimetic, represented by compound 3, which inhibited the enzymatic activity of HIV-1 protease with an IC50 of 3.0 nM, comparable to that of palinavir itself (Table 1). Having reached the sensitivity limit of our assay,18 in order to further optimize our inhibitors, we chose to operate in a less potent series, which would allow a more accurate comparison of inhibitory potencies. This could be achieved by removal of the P2 amino acid residue (Val) from compound 3 to give truncated analog 9 with an IC50 of 19 nM (Table 3). Compound 9 was used as a reference point for probing structural requirements at the C-terminus. As can be seen upon examination of the data presented in Table 3 (compounds 9-15), a variety of structural modifications were applied to the C-terminus amide group. This portion of the molecule proved sensitive to both size and degree of substitution. tertButylamide 9, isopropylamide 10, 1-ethylpropylamide 11, and anilide 15 gave best results (19, 19, 15, and 14 nM, respectively). However, because of side reactions occurring during the synthesis of anilide 15, aliphatic C-termini were selected for further studies. Having examined structural requirements at the C-terminus of these shorter inhibitors, the 1-ethylpropyl group was incorporated in place of the tert-butyl ending in the longer series. Resulting inhibitor 16 (Table 4) exhibited potency comparable (IC50 ) 2.9 nM) to that of 3. Next, the ability of 3 and 16 to inhibit viral replication in cell culture assays was assessed. The antiviral activity was determined with HIV-1 strain IIIB in acutely infected C8166 T cells. Both compounds were potent inhibitors of viral replication in vitro (EC50 ) 15 and 9.3 nM, respectively, Table 4). No apparent cytotoxicity was noticed in this cell line at concentrations up to 1 µM (up to 10 µM for less active compounds). On those grounds, slightly more potent 16 was chosen as the next reference point for further optimization. Examination of X-ray structures of inhibitors bound to HIV-18 or HIV-221 protease suggested that the S2 subsite of the enzymes is comprised of uncharged residues which provide a mostly lipophilic environment to potential ligands. Optimization of our lead inhibitor

16 indicated that a variety of amino acid residues were tolerated at the P2 position. In particular, valine (entry 16) gave a highly potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease and viral replication in vitro. Interestingly, asparagine, which is found at the P2 position of some natural gag and pol cleavage sites (e.g., p17/p24, p1/p6, TF/PR, and PR/RT),5a and found superior with regard to antiviral activity in other series,9b resulted in an inhibitor with almost 15-fold reduced potency in cell culture (17, EC50 ) 127 nM, Table 4). Threonine-containing analog 18 also showed antiviral properties in this cell assay, comparable to those of 17. These findings parallel those made in the pipecolic series of inhibitors where potency in cell culture also decreased when Val was substituted for Asn.9h The viral replication assay results presented

in Table 4 indicate that several of our novel peptidomimetic structures are capable of inhibiting the protease and disrupting viral replication in vitro. Incorporation of a 2-quinolinecarboxyl group at the P3 position of HIV protease inhibitors generally results in improved antiviral properties.9b,h Similar observations were made in the present series of inhibitors as shown in Table 5 (entries 19, 21, and 23). The effect was most pronounced in the case of 21 and 23, incorporating an Asn or Thr residue in the P2 position, when a significant 10- and 20-fold improvement was observed in their respective antiviral potencies. We also examined the use of the 2-quinoxaline group (entries 20, 22, and 24) in an attempt to alter physicochemical properties and improve aqueous solubility of our inhibitors. The latter turned out to be slightly less potent than their quinoline counterparts, but nevertheless, all compounds in Table 5 are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 protease, leading to antiviral activity in vitro comparable to that of palinavir (with the exception of 22). Compounds 19-24 were also tested in an HIV-2 protease assay (see the Experimental Section) and exhibited somewhat reduced potency against this enzyme (Table 5). The observed specificity in favor of HIV-1 is probably a consequence of less favorable interactions between the inhibitors and HIV-2 in both the S2 and S1-S2 regions of the active site. Unfortunately, since an X-ray structure of 23 in complex with HIV-1 protease is not available for comparison, further rationalization as well as the significance of these observations relative to the resistance potential of this class of inhibitors is not possible at this time. Ki Determinations and Specificity. The inhibition constant (Ki) was measured for compound 19 (HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases) using the method for tight binding inhibitors of Morrison and Walsh11,22 (see the Experimental Section for details). As expected, compound 19 is an extremely potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease with an observed Ki of 7.5 pM.23 Examination of Tables 4 and 5 reveals that, in many instances, measured IC50's and EC50's are of the same order of magnitude, our compounds effectively inhibiting viral replication at low nanomolar concentrations. In the case of compound 19, there is a 500-fold difference between the affinity of the compound for the protease (Ki) and the EC50 measured in cell culture. This could result from a number of factors including protein binding of the inhibitor and metabolic stability in cell, as well as the ability of the

inhibitor itself to enter cells. Similar observations were made in the case of palinavir.11 As mentioned previously, some of our compounds display some specificity toward HIV-1 versus HIV-2 proteases. In the case of compound 19 (Ki for HIV-2 ) 1.2 nM), there is a 160-fold difference between the measured Ki's. Most of our inhibitors were also tested for inhibition of human plasma renin, another aspartyl protease enzyme, and were found inactive at concentrations up to 5 µM. Bioavailability.24 Inhibitors 19, 20, 21, and 23 were evaluated for oral bioavailability in rats (n ) 3) at a po dose of 20 mg/kg (formulated in methyl cellulose:Tween80, 0.5:0.01% in water) and iv dose of 1 mg/kg (formulated in DMA/NaH2PO4 0.04 M in 10% dextrose/water: 30/50/20). Compounds 20 and 21 gave very low plasma levels after oral administration (Cmax's <150 and <25 nM were measured in plasma for 20 and 21, respectively). Inhibitors 19 and 23 gave slightly better responses after po administration with average Cmax's of 170 and 530 nM, respectively. In the case of 23, comparison of the area under the curves (AUC) between the oral and intravenous routes translated into an absolute oral bioavailability of 8.6%. X-ray Studies. The crystal structure of HIV-2 protease in complex with 23 was determined at 2.5 Å resolution. The final R factor was 17.9%, and the model had small deviations from ideal geometric parameters (see Supporting Information). As observed with other peptidomimetic inhibitors, 23 binds in an extended conformation which, in this particular case, spans the S3-S2 pockets of the enzyme (Figure 3). The amide groups of the inhibitor are hydrogen-bonded to the protease dimer either directly or through water molecules. The critical hydroxyl group of the transition state mimic ((R)-configuration at the carbinol atom) is located in close proximity to the catalytic Asp25 and Asp25 residues. The P3 to P1 groups of the inhibitor are similar to those for the pipecolic series, and their binding modes and interactions with the protease are

similar.21 The binding mode of the right-hand side of the inhibitor differs in many respect to that of the pipecolic series (Figure 4). The carbonyl oxygen atom of the P1 residue in 23 is about 1 Å away from the corresponding atom in the other series21 due to reversal of the peptide direction. As a result, the position of the conserved water molecule W301 has moved by about 0.5 Å to maintain hydrogen-bond contact with the P1 carbonyl. However, the conformation of the flap residues on the enzyme is not affected. The carbonyl oxygen atom of the P2 residue is hydrogen-bonded to the amido nitrogen of residue 29, replacing the water molecule W302 that was observed in earlier structures.21 The amide group of the P2 residue is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl group of residue 48. The tert-butyl group is inserted into the S1 pocket, and the 3-pentyl group is located between the S2 and S4 pockets. One branch of the pentyl group is in a similar position in the S2 pocket as the tert-butyl group was in the pipecolic inhibitors.21 The other half is extended toward the S4 pocket and is partly exposed to solvent. It is difficult to rationalize the potency differences that are observed between all four possible isomers of the tert-butylsuccinic fragment (compounds 3-6) based on this crystal structure alone, since some conformational changes in the inhibitors are very likely to occur to compensate for the modifications. Additionally, this region of the protease is known to be somewhat flexible.21 The dramatically larger potency loss for compound 5 could be due to a steric hindrance between the tert-butyl group and the main chain of residue 48 in the flap of the protease (based on an examination of the structure of the complex with 23). However, again there are likely to be conformational readjustments in compound 5 upon binding to the protease. Also apparent from this crystal structure is the fact that the S3 pocket of the enzyme remains largely unoccupied. The differences in potency toward HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases from some of the inhibitors listed in Table 5 is difficult to rationalize based on this X-ray structure alone. Several possibilities could be invoked such as the presence of a Thr residue in the P2 position, exposure of the hydrophobic pentyl group to solvent, and the displacement of W302 from the structure. However, similar observations could be made for a complex of 23 with HIV-1 protease, and detailed structural analysis will have to await future studies.

Inhibitor Synthesis. As mentioned earlier, an important element in the design of our backup series of inhibitors was to minimize synthetic complexity. This was achieved by means of a highly convergent approach in which simple building blocks were prepared and assembled in the late stages of the synthesis. This strategy allowed rapid preparation of a large number of inhibitors for SAR studies. The right-hand side of our inhibitors was readily constructed by condensation of succinic anhydrides with amines. cis-Succinamic derivative 2625 was prepared in racemic form from 25, as shown in eq 1, and used as such. Homochiral tert-

butylsuccinic amides 28-34 were prepared from the corresponding anhydrides (R)- and (S)-27 as depicted in Scheme 1 for the (R)-enantiomers. Starting (R)- and (S)-tert-butylsuccinic anhydrides 27 were prepared through resolution of racemic tert-butylsuccinic acid with chiral R-methylbenzylamines, following a literature procedure.26 Opening of anhydride 27 with amines was found to be quite regioselective (ca. 9:1) when conducted at low temperature, and resulting amides 28-34 could be purified to high homogeneity by simple recrystallization. Succinamic derivative 38 was prepared via monobenzyl ester 35 obtained by reaction of 27 with benzyl alcohol in pyridine (regioisomer 36 was also obtained in appreciable amounts, but could be removed by flash chromatography). Coupling to tert-butylamine using benzotriazol-1-yl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU)27 in the presence of N-methylmorpholine gave 37, which was hydrogenolyzed to 38 under standard conditions. tert-Butylamide intermediate 40 was prepared from 39 as shown in eq 2.28

The decapeptide substrate VSFNFPQITL-NH2 was synthesized using standard solid phase methodology. The fluorogenic substrate, 2-aminobenzoyl-Thr-Ile-Nle-Phe(p-NO2)Gln-Arg-NH2, was purchased from Bachem. Protease-free BSA, MES, and EDTA were purchased from Sigma. Common N-protected amino acids, reagents, and solvents were from commercial sources and used as received without purification. Benzotriazol-1-yl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU)27 was purchased from Richelieu Biotechnologies Inc. (Montreal, Canada). ´ IC50 Determinations Using an HIV Protease HPLCBased Assay.30 Recombinant HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were expressed from Escherichia coli and purified as previously described. Enzymatic assays were performed in 100 mM MES, 300 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mg/mL BSA, pH 5.5. DMSO (final concentration was brought to 4.5%) was used to aid solubilization. To 20 µL of a 400 µM solution of VSFNFPQITL-NH2 substrate was added 10 µL of various concentrations of the inhibitor tested. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of 12 nM of enzyme in 10 µL for a final concentration of 3 nM. The assay mixture was then incubated for 45 (HIV-2 protease assay) or 60 (HIV-1 protease assay) min at 37 °C and the reaction terminated by addition of 200 µL of 1%TFA/H2O. Cleavage products and substrate were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a Perkin-Elmer 3 × 3CR C8 column as previously described.30a A nonlinear curve fit using the Hill model was applied to the percent inhibition-concentration data, and 50% effective concentrations (IC50) were calculated through the use of SAS (Statistical Software System, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Extracellular p24 Assay. Inhibition of Viral Replication. The extracellular core protein level, determined by ELISA with the HIV-1 p24 antigen (Ag) Coulter kits, was used to monitor the replication of the HIV-1 IIIB strain. C8166 cells were infected at a MOI of 0.001 in complete medium and were incubated in the presence of serially diluted inhibitors for 3 days. The percentage of inhibition was obtained by determination of the core protein level from pools of supernatants (eight replicas). A nonlinear curve fit using the Hill model was applied to the percent inhibition-concentration data, and EC50's were obtained through the use of the SAS software. No apparent cytotoxicity was noticed in this cell line at concentrations up to 1 µM (up to 10 µM for less active compounds). Ki Determinations.11,22 For classical competitive inhibitors, the velocity of the inhibited reaction was measured at several fixed concentrations, while varying substrate concentrations. Enzyme activity was monitored by the fluorescence change associated with the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate 2-aminobenzoyl-Thr-Ile-Nle-Phe(p-NO2)-Gln-Arg-NH2 (10 µM) in presence of HIV-1 protease (1 nM) or HIV-2 protease (20 nM) as previously described.11 The assay was performed in a final volume of 2 mL of 100 mM sodium acetate, 4 mM EDTA, 1.5 M sodium chloride, 0.025% sodium azide, 1 mg/mL BSA, pH 5.5. The final concentration of DMSO was brought to 1%. The high-salt concentration improved substrate binding affinity, therefore reducing the contribution of dimer dissociation to the data. The reaction was run at 23 °C and initiated by the addition of the enzyme. The fluorescence change associated with the substrate cleavage was monitored using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a high-speed 4-place magnetic stirrer. The excitation wavelength was 320 nm and the emission wavelength 417 nm. Data were collected for a maximum of 400 s, corresponding to a substrate conversion to product of no greater than 25%. All data was analyzed using SAS software. The quadratic equation describing tight-binding inhibition31 was used for the

through aminolysis29 of (2S,3S)-N-Boc-epoxide 41 (Scheme 2). Aminoalkyl epoxide 41 is a key intermediate in the synthesis of palinavir and other HEA-based HIV protease inhibitors. We recently described a practical synthesis of this versatile building block that is amenable to the preparation of large quantities of material.12 Coupling of 41 to succinamic acids using TBTU/N-methylmorpholine gave key intermediate 43. Deprotection (4 N HCl in dioxane) followed by capping with benzyl chloroformate gave inhibitors 9-15. Deprotection of 43 as above, followed by coupling to N-Cbzprotected amino acids, gave compounds 2-7 and 1618. Hydrogenolysis of the benzyloxycarbonyl group of 16-18, followed by coupling (TBTU/N-methylmorpholine) to quinoline-2-carboxylic acid, gave inhibitors 19, 21, and 23. Coupling to quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid gave 20, 22, and 24. Compound 8 with the (S)configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydoxyl group was prepared in the same way as 3, except that the (2R,3S)-isomer of 41 was used.29 Conclusion. We have discovered a highly potent (Ki for HIV-1 protease in the low picomolar range for 19) series of HIV protease inhibitors which contain a novel (R)-(hydroxyethyl)amide isostere. The compounds inhibit viral replication at low nanomolar concentrations. The synthesis of these inhibitors is accomplished in a convergent manner from readily available building blocks. Unfortunately, oral absorption of these compounds was found to be poor, and further development of this series was discontinued. Experimental Section
General. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AC200 or AMX400 spectrometers in deuterated solvents and were referenced to TMS ( scale). Mass spectral data was obtained in FAB mode on a MF 50 TATC instrument operating at 6 kV and 1 mA using thioglycerol or nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) as a matrix support. HPLC homogeneities were determined under reversedphase conditions. System A: Waters (Milford MA) Symmetry

Previous determination of the Km under similar assay conditions,11 in presence of 0.25-10 µM substrate, allowed calculation of the Ki assuming a competitive mode of inhibition. Crystal Structure Determination. Crystals of HIV-2 protease in complex with inhibitor 23 were prepared by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 0.3-0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M NaOAc (pH 5.4), and 0.02% NaN3.21 The crystals belong to space group P43212 with cell dimensions of a ) b ) 62.6 Å and c ) 115.4 Å, isomorphous with those reported earlier.21 Diffraction data to 2.5 Å resolution were collected at 4 °C with an R-Axis imaging plate system. The data processing statistics are summarized in the Supporting Information. The structure of HIV-2 protease reported earlier21 was used as the initial model for the structure refinement with the X-Plor program,32 using reflection data between 6 and 2.5 Å resolution. The inhibitor molecule was clearly visible in the 2Fo - Fc electron density map after one cycle of simulated annealing refinement with the protease atoms. Water molecules were located from difference electron density maps in the later stages of the refinement.

This compound was prepared by a modified literature procedure:34 A 12 L threenecked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and a 1 L addition funnel, was purged with argon

and charged with magnesium turnings (126.0 g, 5.2 mol) and reagent grade THF (5 L). 2-Chloro-2-methylpropane (480.4 g, 5.2 mol) was added slowly over 5 h and the gray slurry stirred for an additional 48 h at room temperature. The suspension was cooled to -75 °C (dry ice/acetone bath), and diethyl maleate (447.0 g, 2.60 mol) in THF (1 L) was added dropwise over 4 h, maintaining an internal reaction temperature close to -75 °C. After completion, stirring was continued for an additional 2 h at -75 °C and the reaction quenched at that temperature by dropwise addition (20 min) of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (500 mL). The reaction mixture was acidified to pH 7 by slow addition of 6 N HCl (ca. 500 mL), and precipitated white solids were removed by filtration using THF for washings. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 2.5 L and extracted with hexanes (5 × 200 mL). The extracts were combined, washed successively with water (3 × 100 mL) and brine (2 × 100 mL), and dried over MgSO4/Norit decolorizing charcoal. Removal of solvents under reduced pressure and distillation of the residue under high vacuum gave racemic 2-tert-butylsuccinic acid diethyl ester as a yellow oil (323.2 g, 54 % yield): bp 105107 °C (1-0.2 Torr). The diester (321.6 g, 1.40 mol) and concentrated HCl (1.5 L) were refluxed overnight, and the partially hydrolyzed reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum to a yellow oil. The material was again refluxed with fresh concentrated HCl (1.5 L) for 24 h. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the desired racemic 2-tert-butylsuccinic acid separated as white crystals. After being cooled to 0 °C, the product was collected by filtration and rinsed with hexanes (3 × 200 mL). The white solid was dissolved in ether (1.4 L), and the solution was washed with brine (3 × 50 mL) and dried over MgSO4. After concentration under reduced pressure to a volume of 250 mL and addition of hexanes (500 mL), the product separated as white crystals that were collected and dried in vacuo (210.8 g, 87% yield): mp 127-130 °C (lit.34 mp 133 °C).

(2R,3S)- or (2S,3S)-N3-Boc-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanes 42 were coupled to equimolar amounts of succinic acid monoamides using TBTU (1.2 equiv) as coupling agent, N-methylmorpholine (5-6 equiv) as base, and dry DMF as solvent. Coupling reactions were allowed to proceed until complete as judged by TLC or reversed-phase HPLC (C-18 column, 0.06% TFA/0.06% TFA in acetonitrile gradients) analysis. After removal of DMF under vacuum, the residue was diluted with EtOAc and the solution washed successively with 2 N NaOH, 1 N HCl, water, and brine. After the mixture was dried over MgSO4 and the solvent removed under reduced pressure, intermediate N-Boc derivatives 43 were obtained in good yield as white solids. When necessary, purification was carried out by flash chromatography on silica gel. The compounds had 1H NMR and MS data compatible with their assigned structures. The above N-Boc intermediates were deprotected by stirring with 4 N hydrogen chloride in dioxane, until complete as shown by TLC or reversed-phase HLC analysis. Removal of volatiles under vacuum followed by trituration with ether gave the desired hydrochloride salts as white solids which were used without further purification. Inhibitors 1-8, 16-18. Crude hydrochloride salts from above were coupled with N-Cbz-protected amino acids (1.1 equiv) using TBTU (1.1 equiv) as coupling agent, N-methylmorpholine (6 equiv) as base, and dry DMF as solvent. Couplings were allowed to proceed until completion as judged by TLC or reversed-phase HPLC analysis. After usual workup, inhibitors were purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using EtOAc/hexanes or EtOAc/MeOH mixtures as eluant. Inhibitors 9-15. Crude hydrochloride salts derived from 43 were dissolved in a mixture of THF and triethylamine (4-5 equiv). Benzyl chloroformate (1.1-1.2 equiv) was added and the mixture stirred at room temperature until completion as shown by TLC or reversed-phase HPLC analysis. Following the usual workup, the inhibitors were purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using EtOAc/hexanes mixtures as eluant. Inhibitors 19-24. N-Cbz-protected derivatives (16-18) were hydrogenolyzed (1 atm of H2 gas) over 20% palladium hydroxide on charcoal (5-10% w/w catalyst/substrate) in MeOH as solvent. Deprotection was usually complete in a few hours as shown by TLC or reversed-phase HPLC analysis. After removal of the catalyst by filtration and concentration in vacuo, free amines were obtained as white solids. The latter were coupled to 2-quinolinecarboxylic acid or 2-quinoxalinecarboxylic acid using TBTU and N-methylmorpholine in DMF in the usual way. Inhibitors were purified to >90% homogeneity (as determined by reversed-phase HPLC in two solvent systems) by flash chromatography on silica gel using EtOAc/ MeOH mixtures as eluant.

(23) For a competitive inhibitor, the relationship between IC50 and Ki values is described by the following equation: IC50 ) 1/2Et + Ki(1 + S/Km) in which Et represents the enzyme concentration. For compound 19, the term Ki(1 + S/Km) is negligible compared to 1/2Et, such that the IC50 value reflects the enzyme concentration rather than the Ki, allowing for the 300-fold discrepency observed between these values.
