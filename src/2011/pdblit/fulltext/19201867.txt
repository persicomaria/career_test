We report the three-dimensional structure of the complex between the major respiratory grass pollen allergen Phl p 2 and its specific human IgE-derived Fab. The Phl p 2-specific human IgE Fab has been isolated from a combinatorial library constructed from lymphocytes of a pollen allergic patient. When the variable domains of the IgE Fab were grafted onto human IgG1, the resulting Ab (huMab2) inhibited strongly the binding of allergic patients' IgE to Phl p 2 as well as allergen-induced basophil degranulation. Analysis of the binding of the allergen to the Ab by surface plasmon resonance yielded a very low dissociation constant (KD 1.1 10 10 M), which is similar to that between IgE and Fc RI. The structure of the Phl p 2/IgE Fab complex was determined by x-ray crystallography to 1.9 Å resolution revealing a conformational epitope (876 Å2) comprised of the planar surface of the four-stranded anti-parallel -sheet of Phl p 2. The IgE-defined dominant epitope is discontinuous and formed by 21 residues located mostly within the strands. Of the 21 residues, 9 interact directly with 5 of the 6 CDRs (L1, L3, H1, H2, H3) of the IgE Fab predominantly by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. Our results indicate that IgE Abs recognize conformational epitopes with high affinity and provide a structural basis for the highly efficient effector cell activation by allergen/ IgE immune complexes.

IgE Abs represent the least abundant class of immunoglobulins occurring at approximately 1000-fold lower concentrations in serum and other body fluids compared with IgG and other Ig classes (2, 3). Nevertheless, minute amounts of immune complexes consisting of IgE Abs and allergens can trigger a

series of inflammatory processes through the binding to and crosslinking of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc RI) on mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and professional APCs such as dendritic cells (4 ­7). In contrast, IgE-allergen immune complexes can regulate IgE production and T cell activation via the low-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc RII, i.e., CD23) (8 ­11). Allergen recognition also directly stimulates the IgE production in IgE B cells leading to increased levels of serum IgE in patients after allergen contact (12, 13). Interestingly, mucosal contact with tiny allergen amounts strongly boosts allergen-specific IgE Ab production but only weakly induces rises of allergen-specific IgG or IgA production (13). Moreover, extremely low concentrations (ng/ml) of allergens are sufficient to induce rapid and strong inflammatory responses through degranulation of mast cells and basophils as well as through the activation of allergen-specific T cells (6, 14, 15). One prerequisite for this efficient activation of immune cells is a highaffinity binding of allergen-IgE immune complexes to Fc RI on effector cells. In fact, IgE binds primarily with its C 2 domain with 10 9 M) to the -chain of Fc RI extremely high affinity (KD (16). Blood and body fluids of allergic patients contain relatively high levels of allergen-specific IgG Abs (17). However, only after a more than 100-fold increase of allergen-specific IgG during allergen-specific immune therapy are these IgG Abs able to compete with allergen-specific IgE Abs and to prevent mast cell degranulation and T cell activation (18). One possibility for the efficient recognition of allergen by IgE Abs is that IgE recognizes different epitopes on allergens than IgG Abs. Evidence for different epitope recognition comes from epitope mapping studies performed with allergen fragments and the analysis of the binding specificities of defined allergen-specific human IgG Abs

(19, 20). Studies performed with allergen-specific serum IgE vs serum IgG report controversial results regarding possible differences between the binding strength of allergen-specific IgE and IgG Abs (21, 22). Many three-dimensional structures of important allergens have been solved but only few allergen-Ab complexes have been characterized so far (23­26). We have previously isolated human IgE Fabs specific for major respiratory grass pollen allergens from a combinatorial library constructed from lymphocytes of a pollen allergic patient (27­29). This is the first report of the three-dimensional structure of the complex between an IgE-derived Fab with a major respiratory allergen, the grass pollen allergen Phl p 2, which is recognized by more than 200 million allergic patients (30). The Fab consisted of an authentic IgE H chain fragment and a randomly combined L chain obtained from the same allergic patient and therefore possibly is not identical with the structure of a complete human IgE. However, the Ab strongly inhibited the binding of allergic patients IgE to Phl p 2 as well as allergen-induced basophil degranulation. The three-dimensional structure of the complex reveals that the epitope defined by the allergen-specific Fab, involves several segments of discontinuous amino acids that are part of a solvent exposed anti-parallel -sheet of the allergen. In the context of experimental evidence gained through the molecular analysis of major allergens, including Phl p 2 (31, 32) our results suggest that IgE Abs from allergic patients recognize conformational epitopes on allergens. This finding has implications for the understanding of allergen-specific IgE responses and the design of specific immunotherapy strategies for IgE-mediated allergies.

Materials and Methods
Allergen, synthetic peptides, sera, huMab2, rabbit immune sera
Purified recombinant Phl p 2 and Phl p 1 were purchased from BIOMAY. The Phl p 2­ derived peptides (peptide 1, aa 1­33; peptide 2, aa 34 ­ 65; peptide 3, aa 66 ­96) comprising the complete allergen were synthesized on the Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer model 433A. Sera from grass pollen-allergic patients, who had been characterized by clinical history, skin prick testing, and grass pollen extract-specific IgE detection, were provided by Christof Ebner. HuMab2 and Phl p 1-specific IgG1 Abs were constructed, expressed, and purified as described (28, 29). Rabbit anti-sera were obtained by immunization of a rabbit with purified recombinant allergens using CFA and IFA, respectively (Charles River Laboratories).

a OD values corresponding to bound Phl p 2-specific IgE are displayed for 29 allergic patients' sera and the serum from a non-allergic individual. Phl p 2 was preincubated with huMab2, an isotype-matched Phl p 5-specific antibody (Phl p 5 ab), Phl p 2-specific rabbit antibodies (r Phl p 2), or Phl p 5-specific rabbit antibodies (r Phl p 5). The percentages of inhibition of IgE binding to rPhl p 2 are displayed for the Phl p 2-specific antibody and the Phl p 2-specific rabbit antibodies. Mean percentages of inhibition are shown in the bottom line. n.d., not done.

5) was injected at 5 l/min into flow cell 2. The surface of the sensor chip was then deactivated by the injection of 1 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5) at a flow rate of 5 l/min for 7 min. Using the same protocol, a purified monoclonal Phl p 1-specific Ab (c 10 g/ml) was immobilized in flow cell 1, which served as reference cell. The final immobilization levels were 3044.4 resonance units (RU)5 (Phl p 2-specific Ab, flow cell 2), and 3086.5 RU (Phl p 1-specific Ab, flow cell 1), respectively. Calculated Rmax for Phl p 2 was 426 RU. rPhl p 2 was diluted in HBS-EP (0.01M HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4) in 2-fold increasing concentrations (starting concentration, 0.3 nM; top concentration, 20 nM) and tested for the binding to the immobilized Abs at a flow rate of 30 l/min for 8 min. Dissociation of rPhl p 2 was investigated by the injection of HBS-EP at 30 l/min for 30 min. Regeneration of the sensor chip surface was performed by injection of 10 mM glycine-HCl, pH 1.5 (30 l/min, 30 s). The complete procedure was done at 25°C. Kinetic and affinity constants were calculated with BIAEvaluation 3.2 (BIACore AB) using a 1:1 interaction model.

Degranulation experiments with humanized rat basophil leukemia cells
The RBL-30/25 cell clone expressing the human -chain of the Fc RI was established by cotransfection of RBL-2H3 cells with three plasmids encoding the human -, -, and -chains of Fc RI (33). The RBL-30/25 cells were maintained in MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FCS (Invitrogen), and 1% L-glutamine (Biochrom). RBL-2H3 cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates (1.5 106/ml; Nunc) and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 2 h. Passive sensitization of the cells was performed by incubating the cells with serum IgE from grass pollen allergic patients (diluted 1/16 in MEM) overnight. The cell layer was then washed three times with 1 Tyrode buffer (137 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl, 0.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1.8 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.4 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 5.6 mmol/L D-glucose, and 0.1% w/v BSA, pH 7.2; Sigma-Aldrich) to remove unbound IgE Abs. The cross-linking of the Fc RI-bound IgE and subsequent degranulation of RBL cells was induced by adding rPhl p 2 (10-fold dilutions between 1 ng/ml and 1 g/ml) in 1 Tyrode buffer plus 50% deuterium oxide to the cells and incubation for 1 h at 37°C. Before rPhl p 2 was incubated with the passively sensitized cells, it was either preincubated

overnight at 4°C with 1) the huMab2 diluted 1/20 in 1 Tyrode buffer (c 30 g/ml); 2) the rPhl p 1-specific Abs diluted 1/20 in 1 Tyrode buffer (c 30 g/ml); 3) rPhl p 2-specific rabbit Abs diluted 1/5 in 1 Tyrode buffer ( 20% rabbit s serum); or 4) rPhl p 5-specific rabbit Abs diluted 1/5 in 1 Tyrode buffer ( 20% rabbit s serum). The release of -hexosaminidase was analyzed by incubating culture supernatants with 1.3 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl- -D-glucosaminide (Sigma-Aldrich) in citrate buffer (0.1 mol/L, pH 4.5) for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine buffer (0.2 mol/L glycine, pH 10.7), and the optical densities were measured at an extinction wavelength of 405 nm to the emission wavelength of 620 nm by using a Spectra Max 340Pc (Molecular Devices). The specific release was quantified by measuring -hexosaminidase activity and expressed as a percentage of the total -hexosaminidase content that was obtained by lysing the cells by the addition of 1% Triton X-100 (Merck). For measurements of spontaneous release and possible unspecific effects, RBL cells were incubated with cell culture medium, allergen alone, or Abs alone. Nonspecific release was never higher than 5% of the total -hexosaminidase release. The specific release was corrected for any spontaneous release, and the resulting release curves were fitted by Sigma Plot.

ELISA competition experiments
The ability of the human rPhl p 2-specific Ab to inhibit the binding of grass pollen allergic patients` IgE Abs to rPhl p 2 was studied by ELISA competition experiments. In brief, ELISA plates (Nunc-Maxisorp) were coated with rPhl p 2 (100 l; c 1 g/ml) in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.6) for 2 h at 37°C. The plates were washed twice with PBST and blocked with PBST containing 1% w/v BSA at 37°C for 3 h. After blocking, the following preincubations were performed in duplicates overnight at 4°C: 1) incubation with purified huMab2 diluted 1/100 in PBST/0.5% w/v BSA (c 6 g/ml); 2) incubation with purified rPhl p 1-specific Abs diluted 1/100 in PBST/0.5% w/v BSA (c 6 g/ml); 3) incubation with rPhl p 2-specific rabbit Abs diluted 1/1000 in PBST/0.5% w/v BSA ( 0.1% rabbit s serum); 4) incubation with rPhl p 5-specific rabbit Abs diluted 1/1000 in PBST/0.5% w/v BSA ( 0.1% rabbit s serum). After washing five times with PBST, the plates were incubated in duplicates with sera from the pollen allergic patients diluted 1/5 in PBST/0.5% w/v BSA and, for control purposes, with serum from a nonallergic individual overnight at 4°C. Bound IgE Abs were detected with mouse monoclonal anti-human IgE Abs (BD Pharmingen) and with a HRP-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare). OD (OD at 405 nm; reference filter, 490 nm) was determined with an ELISA reader (Spectramax PLUS; Molecular Devices). The results represent means of duplicate determinations with variations of less than 10%.

Production of huMab2 Fab by papain digestion and Phl p 2/ Fab complex formation
Purified Phl p 2-specific IgG1 Ab was dialyzed against 30 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 mM EDTA. Papain was added (1:33 w/w ratio) in the presence of 10 mM freshly prepared cysteine, and digestion was conducted at 37°C for 4 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of the specific papain inhibitor E-64 (N-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxirane-2-carbonyl)-leucyl]-agmatine; Roche) in large excess. The digestion mixture was dialyzed against 30 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.8) loaded on a Mono S cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a salt gradient 0 ­500 mM NaCl. The Fab was eluted at 350 mM NaCl and its purity confirmed by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. The purified Fabs were mixed with Phl p 2 in 1:1.2 molar ratio and incubated at 23°C for 60 min. The Phl p 2/Fab complex was separated from excess Phl p 2 by using a Superdex S-75 16/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentration of the Phl p 2/Fab complex was calculated from the absorbance measured at 280 nm, assuming an extinction coefficient of 0.7 mg/ml 1 cm 1.

P42212 using program MOSFLM (34). There is one Phl p 2/Fab complex per asymmetric unit, resulting in a solvent content of 50% (Vm 2.48 Å3/Da) (35).

Structure determination and analysis
The structure of the Phl p 2/Fab complex was determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (36). In the first step, the positions and orientation of the variable, V, and constant, C, Fab domains were determined using the structure of the Fab domain with Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1U6A (37). To avoid difficulties related to the variability in the relative orientations of the V and C domains, the search procedure for the two domains was performed separately. After placing the V and C domains, the position of the Phl p 2 was found by using the structure of the major grass pollen allergen Phl p 2 (PDB code: 1WHO) as a search model. Rigid body refinement with five bodies (Phl p 2, VL, CL, VH, and CH) with REFMAC (36) gave an initial R/Rfree of 43.3/43.8%. Manual adjustment of the model and replacement of the model amino acid sequences with that of Fab were performed with program O (38). This was followed by restrained maximum-likelihood refinement with REFMAC and the addition of water molecules by the program ARP, resulting in the convergence of R/Rfree value to 17.7/22.6% at 1.9 Å resolution (36). The stereochemistry of the refined structure was validated with program PROCHECK (39), which showed that only 0.2% residues are in disallowed regions of a Ramachandran plot. The final model comprises residues V4 ­P94 of Phl p 2, E1­ G213 of the L chain and V1­P213 of the H chain of the Fab, as well as 524 water molecules. For Phl p 2, the electron density is missing for three

Crystallization and data collection
For the crystallization experiments, the purified Phl p 2/Fab complex in 30 mM HEPES (pH 6.8) containing 150 mM NaCl was concentrated to 14.5 mg ml 1. The large crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method within 2­3 days under the following conditions: equal volumes (1.0 l) of the Phl p 2/Fab complex and precipitant 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 0.2 M NaF (condition 1, PEG/ion screen kit) were mixed and equilibrated over the latter solution at 20°C. Before data collection, crystals were soaked briefly in the cryoprotective solution (precipitant solution plus 15% PEG 400 and 150 mM NaCl) and the diffraction data were collected to a 1.9 Å resolution at SLS (Swiss Light Source), using PILATUS detector ( 0.800 Å). All measurements were performed at 100 K. The images were indexed and integrated in space group

The buried surface area was calculated with the program PISA (protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies) European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html) (40) using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. The Ag residues are defined as interfacial if the buried surface area of a residue upon complex formation is larger than 1 Å2. Interactions across the Phl p 2-Fab interface were identified using the program CONTACT (36).

gorithm is based on using the accessibility of amino acids in an explicit manner (41). DiscoTope predicts only one conformational epitope and it assigns the probability of being a part of an epitope to each protein residue.

Results
Specificity and high-affinity binding of huMab2 to Phl p 2 The interaction of huMab2 with its corresponding allergen was assessed by surface plasmon resonance-based assays (Fig. 1). The binding of 2-fold increasing concentrations of rPhl p 2 (0.3­20 nM) was recorded for the flow cell containing immobilized huMab2 and the reference flow cell. The Ab shows a fast onset of binding and almost no dissociation. Association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants were determined to be kon 2.96 105 M 1 s 1 and koff 3.38 10 5 s 1 resulting in a very low dissociation constant of KD 1.14 10 10 M. huMab2 cross-reacted with homologous group 2 allergens from several grasses but did not bind to rPhl p 1 (28). Also huMab2 did

Epitope prediction
The knowledge of B cell epitopes of a given allergen is of great importance for the development of improved diagnostics and specific allergy vaccines. Presently, two methods are available for the prediction of B cell epitopes and are based on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of an Ag alone, conformational epitope prediction (CEP) (41) and DiscoTope (42). Both methods predict the Ag's surface area that is in contact with Ab (epitope). The CEP predicts the antigenic determinants, the conformational (CE) and sequential (SE) B cell epitopes which do not overlap; CEP al-

not bind to synthetic Phl p 2-derived peptides (peptide 1, aa 1­33; peptide 2, 34 ­ 65; peptide 3, 66 ­96) or to a recombinant Phl p 2 mosaic protein with altered fold consisting of reassembled Phl p 2 peptides 1-3-2 (32). huMab2 inhibits allergic patients` IgE binding to the allergen ELISA plate-bound rPhl p 2 was preincubated with huMab2 to study its effect on IgE binding using the sera from 29 grass pollen allergic patients and, for control purposes, serum from a nonallergic individual. huMab2 strongly inhibited IgE binding to rPhl p 2 (mean inhibition: 64.8%) (Table I). Preincubation of rPhl p 2 with an Ab specific for an immunologically unrelated allergen (Phl p 5) had no influence on patients` IgE binding to Phl p 2 (Table I). Next, we compared the inhibition obtained with huMab2 with the inhibition obtained with polyclonal Phl p 2-specific rabbit Abs. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Phl p 2 Abs yielded only a slightly better inhibition of IgE reactivity (mean inhibition 75.5%) than huMab2. Phl p 5-specific rabbit Abs did not show any inhibition (Table I). huMab2 inhibits allergen-induced degranulation of basophils The effect of huMab2 on basophil degranulation induced by rPhl p 2 was investigated using the humanized rat basophilic cell line RBL 30/25. Cells were passively sensitized with sera from grass pollen allergic patients and challenged with Phl p 2 (Fig. 2). huMab2 completely suppressed degranulation of RBL 30/25 cells for the whole range of allergen concentrations tested (1 ng­1 g/ ml), as shown in four representative patients. Similar results were obtained for 11 additional patients (data not shown). The addition of a Phl p 1-specific Ab did not inhibit Phl p 2-induced degranulation at all. When rPhl p 2 was preincubated with polyclonal Phl p 2-specific rabbit Abs the release of mediators was also suppressed but to a lower extent than that achieved with huMab2. Rabbit Abs specific for the unrelated allergen Phl p 5 did not inhibit the mediator release. Crystal structure of the Phl p 2/huMab2 Fab complex The crystal structure of the (1:1) complex of Phl p 2 with a huMab2 Fab was determined to 1.9 Å resolution by molecular replacement (Table II). It was possible to place one Phl p 2/Fab complex per crystallographic asymmetric unit. The final model, refined to 1.9 Å resolution, is characterized by an R factor of 17.7% (Rfree, 22.6%) and the structure is well ordered with corresponding excellent electron density and good stereochemistry (Table II). The overall structure of the Phl p 2/huMab2-Fab complex is shown in Fig. 3A. The Phl p 2 is a compressed anti-parallel barrel built by two four-stranded -sheets sandwiched against each other, a folding typical for immunoglobulins. In the complex, the allergen is directed toward the center of the VH/VL dimer, as usually observed in Ag/Ab complexes. The Fab elbow angles between the variable and constant domains of L and H chains are 139° and 140°, respectively; values which are frequently found for Fab that have a L chain (26, 43). The superposition of free (44) and complexed Phl p 2 results in a root mean square deviation of 0.56 Å for 94 C atoms, indicating that the overall conformation of Phl p 2 has not changed significantly upon complex formation. The Phl p 2/huMab2-Fab interface The interface between Phl p 2 and huMab2 Fab is extensive and involves 21 allergen residues and 25 Fab residues, together with 8 water molecules. The Ab recognizes a discontinuous epitope which is the four-stranded -sheet composed of strands 3, 4, 6, and 7 (Fig. 3B). Most of the epitope residues (67%) are located within four non-contiguous segments belonging to strands 3 (E30, E32, D34, H36), 4 (A43), 6 (N65, R67, F68, L69) and

7 (M74, K75, N76, V77, F78). Additional epitope residues D39, E40, W41, G73, D79, D80 are located in the loops joining the strands and the C-terminal residue P94 (Fig. 3B). The Ag-combining site of the Fab is moderately concave with protuberances and depressions formed by the side chains, which are complementary to those of the Ag thus enabling a tight fit between the two molecules (Figs. 3A and 4C). The shape correlation parameter Sc for the complex, in the absence of water molecules, is 0.71, which is slightly higher than the observed mean Sc value of 0.64 ­ 0.68 for Ag-Ab complexes (45), indicating good shape complementarity. The solvent accessible surface area of Phl p 2 which becomes buried upon complex formation is 855 Å2 which accounts for 15.4% of the total accessible molecular surface (5561 Å2). The corresponding buried area in the Fab is 891 Å2 whereby the buried area of the H chain (544 Å2) is larger than that of the L chain (347 Å2), as is usually observed in immune-complexes. Mode of the Phl p 2/huMab2 Fab interactions The allergen-Ab interactions involves 14 hydrogen bonds, 89 van der Waals interactions, 13 apolar contacts, and no salt bridges were found below 3.8 Å. Of the 21 epitope residues, 9 form hydrogen bonds with residues from five CDRs (L1, L3, H1, H2, H3), (Table III, Fig. 4A), and 12 are in apolar contacts with residues of H1, H2, H3 (Table III). No interactions were observed with residues from CDR L2, which is the farthest from the bound epitope (Fig. 3A), as frequently observed in Ag/Ab complexes (46). In addition, there are 8 water molecules in the complex interface (Table IV) that form 19 hydrogen bonds that bridge Phl p 2 residues with residues from all six CDRs and one residue from the framework region FWR-L2 (Y49) thus improving the fit between the two surfaces (Fig. 4B).

The Phl p 2 epitope is formed by 8 polar (E32, R34, D39, E40, R67, K75, N76, D79) and 3 hydrophobic (W41, V77, F78) residues (Table III). The residues in the center of the epitope are fully buried; the highest contribution to the buried surface of Phl p 2 (53%) is provided by residues K75, R67, V77, D79, and W41 (all fully buried except for K75 which is 90% buried). W41, V77, and F78 form a continuous hydrophobic patch in the center of the contact region and are surrounded mainly by the hydrophilic residues of the epitope and CDR domains (Fig. 4A). The indole ring of W41 is packed against the alkyl portions of the side chains of R34 and R67 (Table III, Fig. 4C). The side chain of the buried R67

and the nearby K75, located in the epitope center, extend into the VH/VL groove where they interact with polar residues from L3 and H3 (Table III). Likewise, the side chain of Y102 (H3) protrudes deeply into a small epitope cavity formed by the apolar side chains of R67, L69, and K75 and the main chain of F68; the hydroxyl group of Y102 forms two water-mediated hydrogen bonds with E30 and E32 (Table IV, Fig. 4C). Thus, the two hydrophobic residues W41 (Phl p 2) and Y102 (H3) appear sandwiched by alkyl parts of the side chains of epitope residues R34, R67, and K75. The Ag-combining site of the Fab is formed by the side chains of the predominantly polar residues from the L and H chain CDRs

X-RAY CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF AN ALLERGEN/IgE COMPLEX the CDR H3 loop is longer in the BLG/D1 Fab complex. The L chains in both Abs are very similar with respect to the sequence and conformation whereas the H chains are very different and are probably responsible for the specificity of binding. The latter assumption is supported by the observation that the L chains of certain allergen-specific IgE Abs can be exchanged without losing specificity for the allergens (49). Furthermore certain animals such as camels and lamas contain Abs that are formed by H chains only (50).

Comparison of allergen/IgG Fab and allergen/IgE Fab complexes The structures of only four allergens in complex with specific Fab Ab fragments have so far been determined by x-ray crystallography: the two complexes of the major allergens from birch pollen (Bet v 1) (24) and bee venom (Api m 2) (25) with specific murine IgG1 Fabs, and the two complexes of the major allergens from grass pollen (Phl p 2), this study, and bovine milk (BLG) (26) with their respective human IgE Fabs (Fig. 5). In both IgG Fab-allergen complexes the allergen epitopes have distinct protruding shapes: a hairpin of Bet v 1 and a helix-loop-helix motif of Api m 2. Another similarity is that both epitopes have a pronounced linear character; the Api m 2 epitope consists of 12 consecutive residues whereas in Bet v 1, 11 of 17 epitope residues are part of a continuous segment (42­52) that contains all the residues that form hydrogen bonds with the Ab and covers 80% of the surface area buried upon complex formation (24). In marked contrast, the IgE binding epitopes of BLG and Phl p 2 are distinctly discontinuous. The epitope of BLG is remarkably flat although it is moderately convex in the Phl p 2 allergen. Because of the high surface complementarity of the Ag-Ab interface, the shapes of the Ag-combining sites in BLG and Phl p 2 complexes are flat and moderately concave, respectively. Generally, there is a correlation between the overall shape of the Ag-combining site and the nature of Ags; deep pockets are observed with haptens, grooves with peptides and flat combining sites with proteins (51). It has been proposed that the shape of the Ag-combining site is determined mainly by the lengths of the CDRs (51, 52). In particular, the short CDR-H3 is more commonly seen in antipeptide and anti-hapten Abs whereas the longer CDR-H3 loops tend to favor large Ags, such as proteins, and implies a flat (or protruding) Ag-combining site. In the Phl p 2/Fab complex CDR-H3 is composed of eight residues and the Ag-combining site

The cutoff distance is 3.25 Å.

(12 and 13 residues, respectively). According to the standard Kabat definitions (47), the CDRs of huMab2 comprise the following residues: CDR-L1 (R24-N34), CDR-L2 (A50-S56), CDR-L3 (Q89-T97), CDR-H1 (S31-S36), CDR-H2 (Y51-S66) and CDR-H3 (L99-I106). Of the 17 Ab residues interacting with Phl p 2, nine are tyrosines (Tables III and IV) which is in agreement with the observation that aromatic residues, particularly tyrosines, form most of the contacts with Ags (46, 48). Generally, the H chain contributes more to the binding of an Ag than the L chain (46). Within the complex, each of the H and L chains form 7 hydrogen bonds with Ag whereas the 13 apolar contacts with Ag involve only residues from three H chain CDRs (Table III). Comparison of Phl p 2/huMab2 Fab and -lactoglobulin/D1 Fab structure The structures of the two complexes of human Abs huMab2 and D1 (26) with their respective Ags showed that the IgE-defined epitope of Phl p 2 consists of a four-stranded anti-parallel -sheet formed by 21 residues whereas in -lactoglobulin (BLG) a larger part of the epitope is a four-stranded -sheet composed of 16 residues whereas a smaller part includes an additional 11 residues located in the loops and -helix. The two IgE-defined epitopes share a number of similar features: a percentage of residues located within the four-stranded strands (67 vs 74% in BLG complex), a size of the buried surface area (855 vs 890 Å2) and a number of hydrogen bonds (14 vs 13). A comparison of the Ab combining sites of the two complexes showed differences in the number of engaged CDRs (5 vs 6 in BLG complex), number of aromatic residues involved (9 vs 2) and

is moderately protruding while in the BLG/Fab complex a distinctly flat Ag-combining site is seen, which correlates well with the longer CDR-H3 loops composed of 17 residues. Structural basis for cross-reactivity Patients allergic to grass pollen frequently display sensitivity to various grasses, indicating that sensitization to one pollen may lead to multiple grass-pollen allergies. There is an extensive cross-reactivity of allergic patients' IgE Abs and of huMab2 with group 2 and 3 grass pollen allergens which share a significant sequence identity (61%) (28, 53, 54). However, no relevant IgE cross-reactivity was found between group 2/3 and group 1 allergens (54, 55) despite a considerable sequence homology between the C-terminal part of group 1 allergens and the entire sequence of group 2/3 allergens (40% identity) (53, 55). To study whether the structurally identified IgE epitope of Phl p 2 is conserved among allergens of group 2 and 3, we examined the conservation of nine epitope residues which are hydrogen bonded to the IgE Fab (Table III) in group 2/3 allergens from six grass species. As shown in Fig. 6A, seven epitope residues are fully conserved (E32, E40, W41, R67, N76, V77, D79) whereas R34 and D39 contain conservative substitutions, suggesting that the identified -sheet epitope is highly conserved among group 2/3 grass pollen allergens. The alignment of the Phl p 2 sequence with nine homologous sequences of the C-terminal domains of group 1 grass pollen allergens revealed full conservation of only three epitope residues D39, W41, and R67 and conservative substitutions for residues E32 and R34, thus explaining the lack of relevant cross-reactivity between group 2/3 and group 1 allergens (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
Here we present the three-dimensional structure of a complex between a major respiratory allergen, the timothy grass pollen allergen Phl p 2 and a Phl p 2-specific Fab derived from an IgE Ab, which was isolated from a combinatorial library constructed from a grass pollen allergic patients' lymphocytes (27). The IgE Fab consists of an authentic IgE H chain fragment that had recombined randomly with a L chain from the same patient and therefore resembles but is not identical with a genuine human IgE Fab. Nevertheless, the isolated IgE Fab reacts with a major IgE epitope of

the allergen. This can be inferred from the fact that the complete Ab huMab2, a hybrid engineered from the variable domain of the IgE Fab and the constant domain of human IgG1, inhibited the polyclonal grass pollen allergic patients' IgE reactivity to the Phl p 2 allergen up to 91% and efficiently blocked allergen-induced basophil degranulation. This strong inhibition indicates that many of the patients IgEs are directed to or close to the same, dominant, epitope of Phl p 2, which is recognized by huMab2, and thus huMab2 has been considered as an IgE-blocking Ab with therapeutic potential (28). One reason for the strong blocking of IgE binding to the allergen by huMab2 may be that the IgE repertoire of grass pollen allergic patients may be less diverse than previously anticipated (56). Indeed, epitope mapping studies performed with several respiratory allergens indicate that an allergen harbors only a few distinct IgE epitopes (31). As a result of such an oligoclonal IgE response to allergens, it is possible that single mAbs can strongly block IgE recognition of allergens. A similar observation has also been made for a human monoclonal IgG Ab, BAB1, which strongly blocks IgE binding to the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 (57). In contrast, it has been demonstrated that allergic patients contain quite high levels of allergen-specific IgG Abs that cannot block IgE binding and IgE-mediated effector cell activation, despite the fact that allergen-specific IgE Ab levels are normally 100 to 1000 times lower than allergen-specific IgG levels (17). In fact, very high affinity of IgE binding to Phl p 2 revealed by our study may provide answers to the question why allergen-specific IgE Abs, despite their extremely low concentrations, are so efficient in activating effector cells and thus inflammatory responses and cannot be competed easily even by an abundant amount of allergen-specific IgG. The structural analysis of the allergen/IgE-immune complex showed that the IgE Fab recognizes a conformational Phl p 2 epitope composed of residues grouped in four sequentially distant segments which are located on the four-stranded -sheet. When we submitted the coordinates of Phl p 2 (PDB: 1who) to CEP (41) and DiscoTope (42), servers that are currently used for epitope prediction, CEP predicted a total of six antigenic determinants, five conformational epitopes, and one sequential epitope. One predicted epitope (CE4) was found to have a maximum overlap with the

X-RAY CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF AN ALLERGEN/IgE COMPLEX immunization with partially denatured or degraded allergens, which may occur upon linking of Ags to adjuvants. In contrast, major respiratory allergens to which patients become sensitized are presented as soluble proteins to the mucosal tissues in native conformation. Pollen allergens, for example, are eluted within minutes from pollen as intact and soluble proteins (63). Allergens are often also very resistant against denaturation by heat or other conditions such as digestion in the gut in the case of food allergens (64). The structurally identified conformational epitope of Phl p 2 and its tight binding to huMab2, closely mimicking the binding of patients IgE, seems to be a paradigmatic example of the high-affinity recognition of conformational epitopes of allergens by IgE and explains why the IgE system is so potent in triggering strong inflammatory reactions despite low abundance of IgE. In conclusion, our data suggest that the tight and efficient binding of allergens by IgE and by IgE/Fc RI complexes on mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and APCs results in formation of exceptionally stable immune complexes that efficiently provoke cascades of inflammatory cell activation. Ultimately, a detailed knowledge of the allergen IgE interaction may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies for type I hypersensitivity reactions based on the interference with IgE recognition of allergens.

experimentally characterized binding site; that is, 18 of 21 epitope residues were correctly predicted (86%). In contrast, DiscoTope predicted correctly only 6 of 21 residues (29%). The reason for this low prediction success is probably due to the fact that the epitope residues are a part of a flat region -sheet, not protruding from the surface, which will negatively influence epitope prediction by DiscoTope emphasizing the need for experimental epitope data. A similar -sheet epitope as found for Phl p 2 has been recently observed in the structure of BLG, a major food allergen, in complex with a specific human IgE Fab designated D1 (26). Also this Fab has been obtained by combinatorial cloning and therefore is not identical with a genuine human IgE Fab. But, this Fab and the Fab described by us recognize epitopes that may be different from those epitopes observed in allergen/IgG complexes. The latter have been shown to have a protruding topology and are often continuous (24, 25). Many epitope properties revealed by the structures of Phl p 2/huMab2 Fab and BLG/D1 Fab complexes have also been observed in Ag/IgG complexes (46). However, the observation that four-stranded anti-parallel -sheet epitopes of Phl p 2 and BLG comprise residues mainly located in the secondary structure elements (67 and 74%, respectively) is a feature not observed among the recently compared 82 structures of protein-Ab complexes (26) despite the frequent occurrence of -structures in the Protein Data Bank. The interaction between the two already solved IgE-allergen immune complexes, Phl p 2/huMab2 Fab and BLG/D1 Fab, revealed a remarkably high binding affinity which differentiates them from the generally lower affinities of many IgG-allergen immune complexes. In fact, the affinity constants of Phl p 2/huMab2 complex (KA 0.9 1010 M 1) and BLG/D2 complex (KA 0.7 109 M 1) are of a magnitude similar to that of the constant region of IgE and the corresponding high-affinity receptor, Fc RI ( 109­ 1010 M 1) (16). The identification of major interactions involved in the protein-protein association process is still an area of intensive research. In principle, protein epitopes are large enough to provide a high affinity through various sets of interactions. For example, the binding free energy can be generated through only a few strong interactions or through the sum of many contacts over the entire surface. In the Phl p 2/huMab2 Fab complex a number of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions could contribute significantly to the binding energy by generating favorable enthalpic effects. The high structural and chemical complementarity of the epitope/paratope surfaces in Phl p 2/huMab2 Fab complex also contributes to the stability of the complex and has been described as an important determinant of specificity of interactions and binding affinity (46). The complementarity is additionally enhanced by the presence of water molecules in the Ag/Ab interface, which mediate hydrogen bonds between the Ag and Ab. Water molecules are frequently found in Ag/Ab and protein/protein interfaces (58 ­ 60) where they contribute to a complex stability by neutralizing the destabilizing effects of unpaired hydrogen bonding groups (61) and by improving the contact between the interacting proteins. Crystallographic studies of lysozyme complexes with specific Abs HyHel-5 (60) and F10.6.6 (62) and D44.1 revealed seven and four water molecules buried in the binding interface where they mediate hydrogen bonding interactions between Ag and Ab. The hydrophobic effect also contributes to the stability of the Phl p 2/huMab2 Fab complex particularly in the center of the epitope, which is hydrophobic and deprived of water molecules, whereas this effect must be weak at the epitope periphery due to the solvation by eight water molecules. The continuous character of previously reported IgG-binding epitopes of Bet v 1 and Api m 2 may have resulted from the mouse
