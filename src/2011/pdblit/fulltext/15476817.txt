Abstract S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is a prospective target for developing new anti-malarial drugs. Inhibition of the hydrolase results in an anti-cellular effect due to the suppression of adenosylmethionine-dependent transmethylations. Based on the crystal structure of Plasmodium falciparum S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase which we have determined recently, we performed mutational analyses on P. falciparum and human enzymes. Cys59 and Ala84 of the parasite enzyme, and the equivalent residues on the human enzyme, Thr60 and Gln85, were examined. Mutations of Cys59 and Thr60 caused dramatic impact on inhibition by 2-fluoronoraristeromycin without significant effect both on its kinetic parameters and on inhibition constant against noraristeromycin. In addition, the impact was independent from the electronegativity of the side chain of the substituting residue. These results showed that steric hindrance between a functional group at the 2-position of an adenine nucleoside inhibitor and Thr60 of the human enzyme, not an electrostatic effect, contributed to inhibitor selectivity. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) is the enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to homocysteine and adenosine [1]. SAH is a strong inhibitor of numerous methyltransferases, enzymes that transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and other small molecules [2]. Since these methylations are required for the proliferation of viruses and tumor cells, the accumulation of SAH leads to anti-virus/anti-tumor effects [3,4]. A number of nucleoside inhibitors of SAHH have therefore been synthesized to

develop anti-viral and -tumor agents [5,6]. Some of these inhibitors are expected to be drugs that act against malaria [7,8], a major parasitic disease that is a major cause of human morbidity and mortality, especially in tropical areas. The rapid emergence of drug-resistant parasites against currently available drugs generates an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. To develop new anti-malaria drugs, it is essential to determine the structure of the enzymes or other molecules that must be inhibited. We recently reported the crystal structure of SAHH from Plasmodium falciparum [9], a causative agent of human malaria. Application of SAHH inhibitors to malaria therapy requires selective inhibition of the parasite enzyme (PfSAHH), since humans also possess an SAHH (HsSAHH). It is therefore necessary to obtain detailed knowledge about ligand binding to both enzymes. Less is known, however, about ligand binding and catalytic mechanisms of PfSAHH than about mammalian SAHHs [10­12]. In a previous study,

we found that the introduction of fluorine to the 2-position of noraristeromycin (NAM), a potent nucleoside inhibitor of SAHH, selectively inhibits the parasite enzyme [13]. The enzyme structure of PfSAHH predicted that Cys59 is the key residue for selective inhibition by 2-fluoronoraristeromycin, in that the Cys59 residue of the parasite enzyme forms a depression around the 2-position of adenosine, enabling it to accommodate fluorine without steric hindrance [9]. In contrast, the side chain of the equivalent amino acid residue in the human enzyme, Thr60, plugs this depression. It is, however, not clear whether selective inhibition by 2FNAM is due only to steric hindrance or also to electrostatic effects, such as electronegativity and hydrogen bonding of the fluorine atom. In this paper, we generate and analyse seven mutant enzymes biochemically in order to reveal the detailed mechanism of the selective inhibition of PfSAHH by 2FNAM.

2.4. Expression and purification of mutant enzymes Wild-type and mutant enzymes were expressed and purified as described [9]. Briefly, E. coli harboring the expression plasmid was grown at 25  C in LB medium. The incubation was continued for 6 h after the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl1-thio- -d-galactopyranoside. The cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mM KHPO4 (pH 7.6), 0.3 M NaCl and 5% glycerol, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4  C. The supernatant (cell extract) was purified by TALON® metal affinity and Sephacryl S300 gel filtration chromatography, with each column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. 2.5. Enzyme assay Enzyme activity was measured in the synthetic direction, i.e. adenosine + dl-homocysteine  S-adenosylhomocystine. Each enzyme (0.05 M) was incubated with adenosine (0.5­100 M), inhibitor (0­500 M) and 5 mM dl-homocysteine in 0.1 mL of 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) at 30  C. Inhibitors were dissolved in 50% dimethylsulphoxide and added to the reaction so as not to exceed 10% by volume. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 L of 0.67 M HCl. An aliquot of the supernatant of each reaction mixture was analyzed for S-adenosylhomocysteine by HPLC [14]. Analysis of the inhibition data was done by nonlinear least squares fitting to the equation IC50 = Ki (1 + [S]/Km ) [15]. 2.6. Structure analysis Least squares comparisons of the molecular models and visualization of the models were carried out using the program CueMol (Ishitani, R., CueMol: Molecular Visualization Framework, http://cuemol.sourceforge.jp/). Molecular surface was calculated using the program MSMS [16].

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmids Escherichia coli JM109 strain was used for all DNA cloning procedures and protein expression. pQEPfSAHH, a plasmid based on the vector pQE30 and which produces hexahistidine-tagged PfSAHH, and pKKHuS, a plasmid based on pKK223-3 and which produces non-fusion HsSAHH, have been described previously [9,14]. 2.2. Construction of pQEHsSAHH pKKHuS was digested with EcoRI, blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and digested with HindIII. The 1.3 kb fragment containing the HsSAHH-coding sequence was ligated into pQE32 that had been digested with BamHI, blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase and digested with HindIII. The plasmid thus generated was named pQEHsSAHH. 2.3. Site-directed mutagenesis pQEPfSAHH and pQEHsSAHH were subjected to sitedirected mutagenesis using the QuikChange method in conjunction with the primer sets listed in Table 1.

3. Results 3.1. Construction of mutant SAHH genes The structures of PfSAHH and HsSAHH used here are described in Fig. 1. The Cys59 residue of PfSAHH is thought to be responsible for inhibition by 2FNAM. The residue was substituted by Thr, the equivalent residue in HsSAHH, and Ser, a homologous residue with Cys. Conversely, Thr60 of HsSAHH was substituted by Cys, Ser and Ala. The Ala84 of ° PfSAHH is located at a distance of ca. 9 A from 6-NH2 group of adenosine. The equivalent of the Ala84 is Gln in HsSAHH and almost all known SAHHs. The residue was exchanged each other between PfSAHH and HsSAHH. Mutant genes containing a codon substitution were successfully prepared by the QuikChange method.

The positions of single amino acid substitutions were indicated similarly (Cys59 and Ala84 of PfSAHH; Thr60 and Gln85 of HsSAHH). (B) Subunit structures of PfSAHH (left, PDB 1V8B) and HsSAHH (right, PDB 1LI4). Bound NAD (orange) and substrate (pale green) molecules were shown as stick models.

3.2. Expression and purification of engineered SAHHs All mutant enzymes were expressed in E. coli cells at 25  C. When the cells were grown at 37  C, most of the wild-type PfSAHH recovered was in insoluble form, and decreasing the temperature improved the yield of the soluble form, as previously reported [14]. Mutant enzymes, including those with single amino acid substitutions, were present in the cell extracts and purified using the same procedures as those used for wild-type PfSAHH. The mutant enzymes exhibited the same mobilities as the parent enzymes on SDSPAGE analysis (Fig. 2). 3.3. Kinetic analyses SAHH catalyzes a reversible reaction; i.e. SAH hydrolysis and SAH synthesis. The synthetic activity predominates in vitro, although the hydrolysis reaction predominates in vivo due to the immediate removal of adenosine. Therefore, the synthetic activity was measured in this study. Steadystate kinetic parameters of the parent enzymes, mutants and chimeras are shown in Table 2. Amino acid substitutions at Cys59 and Ala84 of PfSAHH and Thr60 of HsSAHH had virtually no effect on kinetic parameters. In contrast, the catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km ) of HsQ85A was comparatively low

(ca. 13-fold). Both Km and kcat were altered, in that Km was increased ca. 4-fold and kcat was decreased ca. 3-fold. Gln85 in HsSAHH is the equivalent of Ala84 in PfSAHH. 3.4. Interactions of the mutants with NAM and 2FNAM To estimate the contributions of the point mutations and insertions to ligand binding, we assayed the ability of NAM

4. Discussion S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is an attractive target for anti-malarial drugs, as well as for anti-viral and -tumor drugs. The crystal structure of PfSAHH shows detailed structural differences with the host enzyme, HsSAHH. The Cys59 of PfSAHH is buried in a hydrophobic environment and forms a depression around the 2-position of the adenosine substrate/inhibitor, whereas the hydroxy group of Thr60 of HsSAHH fills this depression. Thus, the depression may serve as a target for the development of inhibitors specific for the parasite enzyme. It was not clear, however, whether the Cys59 of PfSAHH merely forms a depression or whether the sulphur atom of the side chain acts through its electronegativity. To address these questions, we prepared and tested seven-point mutants. As previously reported [9], substitution of Cys59 by Thr resulted in a drastic attenuation of 2FNAM, but not NAM, inhibition. We reasoned that, if this attenuation was due to the presence and/or nucleophilic properties of the hydroxy group, the same attenuation should be observed in PfC59S. We found, however, that 2FNAM inhibition of PfC59S was similar to that of wild type enzyme, indicating that the hydroxy group is not required for inhibitor selectivity. Mutational experiments on HsSAHH also support this conclusion. By replacing Thr60 with Cys, Ser or Ala, all non-branched, small residues, HsSAHH became a 2FNAM-susceptible enzyme. The side chain of Ala is electrically neutral and therefore does not participate in hydrogen bonding, indicating that 2FNAM sensitivity was independent from the electrostatic properties of the residues. Since the kinetic parameters, inhibition by NAM and CD spectra of the enzyme (data not shown) were not perturbed by these mutations, it is unlikely that a conformational change induced by the mutations affected 2FNAM inhibition. Our results thus indicate that the selective inhibition of PfSAHH by 2FNAM was due to the depression formed at Cys59, whereas, in HsSAHH, there is steric hindrance between the 2-fluorine of 2FNAM and the hydroxy group of Thr60 (Fig. 3). Indeed, calculated enzyme surface model indicated an intereference with the 2-fluorine atom in HsSAHH, but not in PfSAHH. Similar interaction/repulsion of inhibitors has been reported for the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase­ thymidylate synthase bifunctional enzyme (PfDHFR­TS), which catalyzes sequential reactions in the thymidylate cycle and is an important target of anti-malarial drugs [17]. Naturally occurring mutation(s) in the enzyme causes resistance to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, potent inhibitors of the wildtype enzyme. For example, a Ser to Asn mutation at residue 108 has been shown to result in 8.7- and 5.8-fold increases of the Ki values to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, respectively

and 2FNAM to inhibit the activity of each. NAM is a potent inhibitor of SAHH, and we previously showed that introduction of a fluorine to the 2-position of NAM significantly decreased its affinity to HsSAHH but not to PfSAHH [13]. Based on the crystallographic structure of PfSAHH which we have resolved recently, it is most likely that this selectivity was due to the space around the 2-position of the adenosine analog, which is formed by Cys59. In support of this, we reported that the C59T substitution, in which the PfSAHH residue was replaced by the corresponding HsSAHH residue in the non-fusion type enzyme, altered inhibitor selectivity [9]. This selectivity, however, may have been due to steric hindrance and/or to the electronegativity of fluorine. Although both NAM and 2FNAM resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of both the mutant and wild-type enzymes, there were remarkable differences between them (Table 3). As described previously, replacement of the Cys59 residue of PfSAHH by Thr, which possesses a hydroxyl group but a branched side chain, significantly decreased enzyme affinity to 2FNAM but not to NAM [9]. When the Cys59 was replaced by Ser, which possesses the same size, shape and hydrophobicity, the Ki values were similar to those of the parent enzyme. In contrast, replacement of Thr60 of HsSAHH by non-branched, small residues (Cys, Ser and Ala) led to an increase in 2FNAM inhibition, to the same level as that of wild-type PfSAHH. Because the side chain of Ala cannot form any hydrogen bonds to the inhibitor, the increased affinity of 2FNAM to PfSAHH was not due to hydrogen bonding

network in the active site with Ser83 and Leu347 via a water molecule, while such network is absent in PfSAHH. Therefore, it is likely that such network is lost in Q85A mutant. The loss of the hydrogen bond network might destabilize the active site structure of Q85A and cause decrease in catalytic efficiency. Although the exact cause of the partial inactivation is unknown, it is obvious that the residues are unrelated to the inhibitor specificity of 2FNAM. In conclusion, we have revealed here the detailed mechanism of the selective inhibition of PfSAHH by 2FNAM. The selectivity arises from the steric allowance, not an electrostatic effect, at the position of 2-fluorine of 2FNAM. These findings may provide a better understanding of the interactions between PfSAHH and its specific inhibitors, and thus may be valuable in designing anti-malarial reagents.

[18]. These decreases in affinity are due to steric hindrance between the side chain of Asn108 and the chlorophenyl ring of the drugs [19]. Additional mutations to this enzyme have been found to drastically decrease their affinity to substrate. These facts indicate that small steric factors may provide a key to drug development. An Ala to Gln mutation at residue 84 of PfSAHH had little effect on inhibitor selectivity or enzyme kinetics. Since Ala84 of PfSAHH is located far from its substrate adenosine [9], the result is convincing. On the other hand, mutation of Gln85, the equivalent of Ala84 in PfSAHH, to Ala resulted in the decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km ), although little effect was observed in inhibitor selectivity and CD spectrum (data not shown). The Gln85 of HsSAHH forms a hydrogen bond
