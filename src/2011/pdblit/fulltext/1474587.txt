The three-dimensional structure of human carbonic anhydrase II complexed with azide and with bromide was investigated crystallographically. Both of these non-protonated inhibitors replace the zinc and the `deep' water, two catalytically important water molecules in the active site of the molecule. Both the azide and the bromide ions bind in a distorted tetrahedral manner 0.4 and 1.1 A from the zinc water position, respectively, but are in close contact (2.0 and 2.6 A, respectively) with the zinc ion.

1. INTRODUCTION The zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1) catalyzes the reversible reaction CO, + H,O w HCO; + H'

in a wide variety of organisms and tissues [l]. The structure of the enzyme is composed of a ten stranded p-sheet surrounded on both sides by stretches of a mostly non-helical structure [2]. The active site is located in a 15-A deep and 15-A wide cavity between the p-sheet and the non-helical structure. Three histidine residues, 94, 96 and 119, all of which belong to the p-sheet, coordinate to the essential active site zinc ion. The fourth ligand is a water molecule at low pH (< 7) and a hydroxide ion at high pH (> 7) [3]. We have made extensive attempts to reach a structural understanding of inhibition, substrate binding and catalysis using isoenzyme II from human erythrocytes (HCAII). Crystallographic investigations of the complex with bisulfite have shown that one oxygen, presumably protonated, replaces the zinc water with tetrahedral coordination geometry [4,5]. The formate complex with HCAII on the other hand shows a penta-coordinated zinc ion [4], with both the inhibitor and the zinc water coordinated to the metal. The reason for this difference is that T199 Oyl can only function as a hydrogen bond acceptor in relation to the tetrahedral position on the zinc ion [6]. The binding of bicarbonate to the T200H mutant of HCAII [7] is consistent with the

above observations. In all three cases, the non-protonated oxygens of the ligands were found in analogous positions. Spectroscopic investigations of some inhibitor complexes with cobalt(I1) substituted carbonic anhydrase have been interpreted in terms of either tetra-or penta-coordination of the metal [8]. Other ions like bromide and azide, both unprotonated, seem to fall into another category with coordination between four and five. What this means in structural terms is the subject of the present crystallographic investigation.

2. MATERIALS

AND METHODS

2.1. Data collection Crystals of HCAII were grown in complex with 1 mM Hg'+ in 2.4 M (NH&SO, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 [9]. The crystals were soaked in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, with 5 mM /I-mercaptoethanol in order to remove the Hg2+ ions and subsequently in the inhibitor solutions shown in Table I. The crystals belong to space group P2, with cell parameters a = 42.7 A, b = 41.7 A, c = 73.0 A and B = 104.6". Diffraction data were collected with a Siemens (Xentronics) multiwire area detector mounted on a Rigaku RUZOOHEB rotating anode X-ray generator (CuKa radiation, 0.3 mm focal spot, graphite monochromator, 0.5 mm collimator). The reflection data were integrated, reduced, merged and scaled using the program suite XENGEN [lo]. The data collection statistics is summarized in Table I. 2.2. Refinement The calculations were performed on a VAX station 3100. Restrained least square refinement was done with PROLSQ [11,12] using all diffraction data below 10 A resolution. The 2 IFol~lFcl and IFolIFcl electron density maps were calculated using the program suite CCP4 [13] and inspected on an Evans and Sutherland PS390 graphics workstation using the program FRODO [14,15]. The geometry of the azide ion was optimized by the real space refinement of FRODO. The starting model for the refinement of the complexes was the refined structure of HCAII [4], where a few active site water molecules were removed. The inhibitor and solvent molecules were successively

3. RESULTS 3.1. The complex with azide The binding of the azide ligand in the active site of the enzyme is shown in Fig. 1. The N3 atom replaces the zinc water and the Nl atom replaces the `deep' water in the native structure. The differences in location between N3 and the zinc water, and between Nl and the deep water are both 0.4 A. The distances between N3 and the zinc ion is 2.0 A, and between N3 and T199 Oy 1 3.2 A. The Nl atom is 3.4 A from T199 N and 3.7 A from T199 0~1. The only water which is within hydrogen bond distance to the azide is water 318. It is 2.6 8, away from N3 and 3.4 A away from N2. Water 389 is not observed. The native position of this water is 3.1 A away from the azide N2 atom, which has no lone pair available for hydrogen bonding. 3.2. The complex with bromide at pH 6.0 The structure of this complex is shown in Fig. 2. The bromide ion replaces both the zinc water and the deep water in the active site of the enzyme, 2.5 A away from

electron density maps were consequently difficult to interpret. The bromide ion replaces both the zinc water and the deep water, as was found at pH 6. Its distance to the zinc ion is 2.6 A. The distances to T199 Oyl and to T199 N are 3.5 A and 3.8 A, respectively. Thus there are no significant differences between the two structures, however, at higher pH, hydroxide ions compete for coordination to the zinc ion. The enzyme was therefore not saturated with respect to bromide in the pH 7.8 experiment, but it is reasonable to assume that, once bound, the structure of the bromide complex is independent of pH [2]. The electron density of water 389 is rather weak, and at a distance of 3.4 A from the bromide ion. The site is probably occupied only when there is no bromide bound. 3.4. General The conformation of the peptide chain was, in all three cases, unaffected by inhibitor binding. The root mean square deviations for Cal atoms from the native positions were 0.07, 0.17 and 0.08 A, respectively. 4. DISCUSSION Both azide and bromide replace the zinc water as well as the deep water, and the coordination number of the zinc ion is four in both cases. The coordination is significantly distorted from normal tetrahedral geometry (Tables III and IV). The inhibitors cannot bind close to T199 Oyl due to their lack of protons and to the lone pair the former keeps oriented towards the tetrahedral zinc water position. Bromide thus behaves essentially as

iodide (Kannan, K.K., personal communication) with respect to its coordination to the metal. The fact that these two ligands can replace the zinc water without donating a proton to T199 Oyl might be due to their softness (polarizability), compared to oxygen. Soft anions have a higher affinity for relatively soft cations like zinc and, conversely, hard anions have a higher affinity for hard cations like alkali and alkaline earth metal ions [16]. The higher polarizability of the bromide and azide ions might alleviate the confrontation between its electron orbitals and the lone pair of T199 0~1. That the hydrogen bond network in these complexes really is intact is supported by the increased distances between inhibitor and Thr199 0~1, as compared to previously analyzed tetrahedral complexes. Furthermore, no previously investigated anion complex (listed in [4]) has suggested reversal of or drastic changes in the G1u'06-Thr'99 hydrogen bond network in native HCAII. Thus we conclude that hard anions with oxygen ligands binding to the tetrahedral position require that they are proton donors, but that soft anions might bind tetrahedrally, with distortions in coordination geometry if they lack protons.
