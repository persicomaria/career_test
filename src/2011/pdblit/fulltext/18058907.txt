ABSTRACT The catalytic trimer of Methanococcus jannaschii aspartate transcarbamoylase is extremely heat stable, maintaining 75% of its activity after heat treatment for 60 min at 758C. We undertook its structural analysis in order to understand the molecular basis of its thermostability and gain insight on how its catalytic function adapts to high temperature. Several structural elements potentially contributing to thermostability were identified. These include: (i) changes in the amino acid composition such as a decrease in the thermolabile residues Gln and Asn, an increase in the charged residues Lys and Glu, an increase in Tyr and a decrease in Ala residues; (ii) a larger number of salt bridges, in particular, the improvement of ion-pair networks; (iii) shortening of the N-terminus and shortening of three loops. An interesting feature of the crystal structure is the association of two crystallographically independent catalytic subunits into a staggered complex with an ° intertrimer distance of 33.8 A. The active site appears similar to Escherichia coli. Upon substrate binding, smaller changes in the global orientation of domains and larger conformational changes of the active site residues are expected as compared to E. coli.

INTRODUCTION Aspartate transcarbamoylase (EC 2.1.3.2) catalyzes the second step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, the reaction between CP and aspartate to form N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate,1 and is an important site of regulation of this pathway in many organisms. ATCase exists in various quaternary structures in different organisms. For example, in Bacillus subtilis the enzyme is an unregulated trimer of catalytic chains.2 In mammals, the first three steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis are catalyzed by a large multifunctional enzyme called CAD3 which is a multimer of identical subunits with all three activities--ATCase, CPSase, and DHOase. The structure and properties of Escherichia coli ATCase have been extensively studied.4­8 It has a dodecameric structure (C6R6) composed of two types of subunits. The two larger or catalytic subunits (C3) are each composed of three identical polypeptide chains (Mr 33,000) while the three smaller or regulatory subunits (R2) are each composed of two other identical polypeptide chains (Mr 17,000). The catalytic chains have two domains, the CP and the ASP binding domains. The regulatory chains also have two domains, the nucleotide and the Zn binding domains. E. coli ATCase is an allosteric enzyme exhibiting cooperativity for aspartate, and heterotropic effects, being activated by ATP and inhibited by CTP. Upon binding the substrate aspartate (in the presence of saturating CP), E. coli ATCase undergoes a conformational change from a low activity T state to a higher activity R state. The large conformational differences in the X-ray structures of the unliganded ATCase9 and the PALA liganded enzyme10,11 were proposed to define the structural differences between T and R states. Methanococcus jannaschii is a unicellular, anaerobic, and autotrophic archaeon, living on CO2, N2, and H2, and growing at temperatures 48­988C,

and at pressures greater than 200 atm.12 The M. jannaschii genome has been sequenced13 and contains genes coding for both the catalytic and regulatory chains of ATCase; however, the two genes are approximately 200,000 bases apart. It has been shown14 that the catalytic chains associate to form a trimer and the regulatory chains associate to form a dimer. Furthermore, catalytic trimers and regulatory dimers associate in vivo to form a dodecamer, similar to that of E. coli. Kinetic analysis of the M. jannaschii ATCase from the cell-free extract showed that the enzyme has limited homotropic cooperativity and little if any regulatory properties with ATP and CTP under the conditions tested. The C trimer has hyperbolic kinetics with an activation energy similar to the E. coli trimer suggesting that the rate limiting steps for the two enzymes are the same. Its activity increases with temperature. It is stable at 858C. The structures of two hyperthermophilic ATCases have been previously described. These are the C trimer of the Pyrococcus abyssi enzyme complexed with PALA15 and the intact ATCase holoenzyme from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.16 These structures demonstrated both similarities as well as significant differences in their strategies for thermostabilization. We undertook the structural analysis of the C trimer of the M. jannaschii ATCase for two reasons. First, we were interested in understanding the mechanism of its extreme heat stability at the molecular level. Second, we were interested in gaining insight into how its catalytic function adapts to high temperature. In this paper, we report the determination of its crystal structure and compare it with those of the mesophilic E. coli9,11,17,18 and the hyperthermophilic P. abyssi15 and S. acidocaldarius16 ATCases. This is the first structural report of an unliganded hyperthermophilic C trimer. METHODS
Protein preparation

ammonium sulfate and 5% 2-propanol. The drops consisted of equal volumes of reservoir and protein solution. The crystal used for this study was a triangular prism, space group C2, cell constants a 5 139.90, b 5 91.89, c ° 5 154.20 A, and b 5 98.308, two trimers per asymmetric ° unit, VM 5 2.43 A3/Da.20 A different rhombohedral crystalline form grows under similar conditions and was reported earlier.21
X-ray data collection

Diffraction data were measured at the Macromolecular Crystallography Laboratory of the Division of Experimental Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center using an R-AXIS IV image plate installed on a Rigaku RU300H rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 100 mA with Molecular Structure Corporation mirrors. Oscillations were measured for 26 min each in 1.08 intervals of u from u 5 08 to u 5 658. The crystal to detector distance was 210 mm. The data were processed with the HKL2000 software package.22 Data statistics are summarized in Table I.
Structure determination and refinement

The M. jannaschii C trimer was prepared following the procedure of Hack et al.14 from E. coli strain EK1911 which has a deletion in the pyrBI region on the chromosome and contains plasmids pEK406 coding for the M. jannaschii catalytic chain and pSJS124019 coding for rare archaeal tRNA's. The purification involved a 30% ammonium sulfate precipitation step, a heat step at 363 K for 15 min, and chromatography using a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anionexchange column and a phenyl Sepharose column.
Crystallization

The purified protein was concentrated to 15 mg/mL in 40 mM KH2PO4, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol pH 7.0. Crystals were grown at 295 K by the sitting drop method from reservoirs containing 2.0 M

The structure was solved using molecular replacement by evolutionary search with EPMR23 and data in the re° solution range 15.0­4.0 A. A search model was generated from the atomic coordinates of the unliganded C trimer of E. coli17 that shares 47% sequence identity with M. jannaschii. In this model, all residues were replaced with Ala unless they were common in the two proteins. Additionally, all surface loops which were expected to differ were deleted. Rigid body refinement of the molecular replacement model with CNS24 in the resolution range ° 100.0­4.0 A gave an R value of 0.39. The refinement of the structure was carried out with CNS24 using simulated annealing with torsion angle dynamics. During the refinement NCS restraints were imposed for both main and side chains for the four regions 2­131, 132­146, 147­280, and 281­303 among the six monomers with the exception of residues 163­ 164, 214­218, 239­240, and a few side chains. The refinement alternated with manual model building and rebuilding using the program O.25 The missing parts of the model were fit and the structure was refit from electron density maps computed with phases improved by solvent flipping, density truncation, and NCS averaging over all six monomers. For each amino acid, two group temperature factors were refined, one for the main chain and one for the side chain. Two sulfates were incorporated in the model in the central tunnel of each trimer on the noncrystallographic threefold and were harmonically restrained to their initial positions as well as with respect to each other together with residues 55­67 of the monomers in each trimer. At the end of the analysis,

Structure superpositions were performed with LSQMAN.33 Figures were prepared with PYMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge.net). Planar angles between CP and ASP domains were computed by a modification of the method of Williams et al.34 using the angle between the geometric centers of the two domains and a hinge point. Geometric centers for the CP and ASP domains for the M. jannaschii C monomer were computed from the Ca coordinates of residues 1­131 and 147­280, respectively. The Ca of residue 137 was used as the hinge. The corresponding residues were used for the computation of the angles in the other ATCases.

The quality of the structure was analyzed with PROCHECK.26 Hydrogen bonds distances were calculated with HBPLUS,27 and correspond to donor­acceptor dis° tances less than 3.5 A, hydrogen­acceptor distances less ° , and associated angles greater than 908. Salt than 2.5 A bridges between two charged groups correspond to dis° tances less than 4.0 A. A hydrophobic contact was assumed to exist between two apolar residues if the car° bon­carbon distance was less than 4.0 A. Aromatic contacts involve atoms of side chains of aromatic residues at ° distances less than 4.0 A. Secondary structure assignments 28 The same program was used for were made with DSSP. computing accessible surface areas. Probe accessible cavity ° volumes were computed with VOIDOO29 using a 1.2 A

The final model consists of two crystallographically independent trimers, two sulfates, and 127 waters. Final refinement statistics are presented in Table I. All the stereochemical parameters are better than expected for a model at this resolution. In the Ramachandran plot, computed using PROCHECK,26 87.2% of the residues are lying in the most favorable regions. The final map, contoured at 0.9r, shows continuous density for most main chain and side chain atoms with a few exceptions. There is either fragmented or absent electron density for residues 32­33, 73­83, 126­129, 216­218, and beyond 303 in all monomers as well as residues 212­214 in some monomers. Residues 126­129 and residues beyond 303 were not included in the model in any of the monomers. In addition, there is fragmented or absent electron density for the side chains of residues 48, 49, 50, 51, and 164 in some monomers. Finally, a few residues on the surface of the monomers do not have side chain electron density. These are mostly Lys's and a few Glu's, Arg's, Asp's, and Asn's.
Monomer structure

The fundamental structural unit of the trimer is one catalytic chain. As in other ATCases,9,11,15­18 the cata-

comprise a hinge between domains. The two domains border a large, substrate binding cleft. The six chains in the asymmetric unit are closely similar to each other. The RMSD between corresponding Ca's in the six chains ° does not exceed 0.33 A. The M. jannaschii catalytic monomer shares 47% sequence identity with E. coli and the two proteins have a similar core structure with the mutual positions of the helices and b strands closely similar [Figs. 1(b) and 2]. Superposition of the six M. jannaschii C chains with the three chains of the isolated unliganded E. coli C trimer17 ° gave RMSD for Ca's in the ranges 0.83­0.92 A for the ° CP domains, 0.81­0.98 A for the ASP domains, and ° 0.98­1.13 A for the whole chains. The largest differences between the two structures are found in the first helix and in the 240's loop. In M. jannaschii, there is a four residue insertion in helix a1 which extends this helix by one turn [Figs. 1(b) and 2]. The C-end of this helix protrudes at the outside of the molecule and the loop connecting a1 to b2 is oriented differently from E. coli. In the 240's loop, there is an insertion of a proline (Pro233) compared to E. coli. This loop is well defined in all six chains of M. jannaschii, in contrast to the E. coli isolated trimer where this loop is well defined in only one of the chains and is disordered in the other two. The conformation of the 240's loop in M. jannaschii is distinct from all E. coli structures. In addition, three loops are shortened as compared to E. coli. The first corresponds to the deletion of a Gly after position 80, the second corresponds to the deletion of a Gly after position 117, and the third corresponds to the deletion of a dipeptide Ala­Asn after position 256. The M. jannaschii C trimer has a shorter N-terminus compared to E. coli.

lytic chain [Fig. 1(a)] contains two domains--the N-terminal, CP binding domain (residues 1­131) and the Cterminal, ASP binding domain (residues 147­280). Each domain is organized around a b-pleated sheet of five parallel strands surrounded by helices. Trimerization is mediated primarily by the N-terminal, CP binding domains. The C-terminal, ASP binding domain is connected to the N-terminal domain by two a helices (a5, residues 132­146; and a10, residues 281­301) which

The two crystallographically independent trimers in the asymmetric unit associate tightly to form a complex of two trimers with 32-point group symmetry as seen in Figure 3. In this complex, the two molecular threefold axes of each trimer coincide and form a common threefold axis joining their geometric centers. The three twofold axes pass through the center of the complex, are perpendicular to the threefold and are directed half-way between the centers of the monomers of adjacent trimers as indicated in Figure 3. The convex faces of the trimers point to the exterior of the particle. Looking down the ° threefold axis the diameter of the particle is $93 A. Looking perpendicular to the threefold axis, the length of ° the particle is $78 A. Each trimer has a sulfate on the threefold in its central channel (see Fig. 4). These sulfates most likely came from the crystallization medium. One of the SÀ ÀO bonds is along the threefold and points toward the center of the complex. The other three are related by the threefold. The two sulfates are related by the same twofold axes as the trimers.

Analysis of hinge angles of monomer domains

The isolated unliganded E. coli C trimer shows large variation in the hinge angles among its three chains, 6.18 (Table II), indicating high flexibility in solution and high reactivity. In contrast, both trimers in the M. jannaschii C complex exhibit near threefold symmetry with the hinge angles among the six chains differing by less than 1.58 (Table II). The constancy in the hinge angles among

the six crystallographically independent monomers indicates a very stable conformation that cannot be easily distorted in different crystalline environments, is expected to be maintained in solution, and may be correlated with the lower activity of the enzyme at room temperature.14 The interconnection between flexibility and activity was discussed by Beernink et al.17 who suggested that the assembly of the active subunits into an allosteric enzyme involves modulating the potential for conformational changes essential for catalysis.

Side view is down the non crystallographic twofold. Colors of monomers are as in (a).

Hinge angles are sensitive indicators of domain movements35 and it is unlikely that they are affected by resolution. It may be noted in Table II that the hinge angles of the M. jannaschii C trimer and S. acidocaldarius ATCase are smaller than the corresponding E. coli unliganded C trimer and T-state holoenzyme, respectively. In contrast, the angle of the P. abyssi C trimer complex with PALA is larger than of the corresponding E. coli C trimer complex and R state E. coli holoenzyme. Even though

there are not data for the same system in both complexed and uncomplexed forms, it appears that, upon substrate binding, the planar angle closes less in hyperthermophilic proteins compared to E. coli.

in this protein. Upon substrate binding, the planar angle between domains in the M. jannaschii catalytic chain is expected to decrease less compared to E. coli. In addition, larger conformational changes involving the active site residues are expected in order to bring them closer to the active site.

The C1­C2 interface between two catalytic chains of one trimer contains the catalytic site and involves both the ASP and CP domains of one monomer and the 80s loop of the adjacent monomer.

The ASA buried in this interface in the M. jannaschii C trimers is comparable to the E. coli T state enzyme. It has been shown that ASA's do not depend on resolution.37 Several polar interactions are conserved among the M. jannaschii, E. coli, and P. abyssi C trimers. The S. acidocaldarius system shows the largest deviations. There are more charged residues in this interface in M. jannaschii compared to E. coli, resulting in more salt bridges across this interface (Table III). In particular, the C1­C2 interface in the

The sulfates lie at the center of the three CP domains of each trimer on the noncrystallographic threefold (see ° Fig. 4). The distance between the two S atoms is 47.2 A. Each sulfate is involved in an extended ion-pair network in the central channel through its three oxygens that are related by the noncrystallographic threefold and charged residues of the a2 helix that point in the central channel. The network for each of these three sulfate oxygens is as follows À ÀO(S). . .Lys63. . .Glu59. . .Arg55 (see Fig. 4). A situation similar to the M. jannaschii C trimer was observed in the OTCase from Pyrococcus furiosus in which a sulfate ion binds in the central channel on the

Comparative studies between mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic proteins have identified factors that are important for increasing thermostability in proteins but there is not a unique mechanism that is responsible. Each protein has a unique set of strategies that it employs to increase its thermal stability.39 We analyze below the factors that may contribute in stabilizing the M. jannaschii C trimer structure.
Amino acid composition

In agreement with the observed trends in the relative amino acid composition of mesophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins,39 more charged residues are found in the M. jannaschii C chain compared to E. coli (see Fig. 2),

especially Glu and Lys, fewer deamidation-susceptible Gln and Asn residues, more Tyr and fewer Ala residues. Similar trends are observed for the P. abyssi15 and S. acidocaldarius16 subunits except that Asn occurs as frequently in S. acidocaldarius16 as in E. coli. The differences in the amino acid content are reflected in the accessible surface areas of the monomers in Table III. The total ASA of the catalytic monomer is larger in M. jannaschii than in E. coli with a large increase in the ASA due to charged residues. The trend is similar in the P. abyssi and S. acidocaldarius monomers. These observations are unlikely to be affected by the different resolutions of the compared structures as ASA's do not depend on resolution.37
Secondary structure elements

Val266, Asp267, and Glu268. This cavity is also present in the isolated uncomplexed E. coli C trimer with similar ° volume 10.0 A3. It is absent from the C subunit of P. abyssi. Instead, this structure contains a hydrophobic ° cavity of volume 16.0 A3 at another location. The S. acidocaldarius monomer contains no cavities. These observations are unlikely to be affected by the different resolutions of the compared structures as cavity volumes do not depend on resolution.40
Hydrogen bonds, ion pairs, and aromatic interactions in the monomers

There are only small local differences in secondary structure between the E. coli and M. jannaschii catalytic chains (see Fig. 2). Some of them could be due to the different resolutions of the two analyses. Similar observations were reported for the P. abyssi15 and S. acidocaldarius16 systems. Several hyperthermophilic proteins show shorter loops and termini than their mesophilic counterparts as part of their thermostabilization strategy.39 As in the P. abyssi15 and in the S. acidocaldarius16 enzymes, two loops are shorter by one residue in the M. jannaschii C chain, in each case a Gly. This should increase the rigidity of these loops and increase thermostability. In spite of the deletion, the 80s loop is still disordered. There is an additional deletion of two residues following position 256 in M. jannaschii (see Fig. 2). In the P. abyssi15 and S. acidocaldarius16 chains, these positions have highly charged residues, Asp­Glu and Lys­Asp, respectively, replacing the sequence Ala­Asn of E. coli. It is interesting that thermostabilization is achieved by shortening the loop in M. jannaschii and by replacing the dipeptide with highly charged Glu, Lys, and Asp residues in the S. acidocaldarius and P. abyssi chains. In M. jannaschii, the N-terminal region is six residues shorter than in E. coli (see Fig. 2) which should decrease its thermal flexibility. In P. abyssi15 and S. acidocaldarius16, both the N and C terminal regions are shorter than E. coli.
Packing density and cavities

Table III shows that there are fewer hydrogen bonds in the M. jannaschii C chain as compared to E. coli and more salt bridges, in agreement with the differences in amino acid content. More important, however, is the presence of ion pair networks which increases dramatically to 45­56% as compared to only 33% in E. coli. Even though these numbers may change at higher resolution, it is likely that these tendencies will be preserved. Ion pair networks represent a strong stabilizing mechanism for hyperthermophilic proteins.39 Similar strategies are adopted by the P. abyssi C trimer15 and S. acidocaldarius ATCase16 (Table III). There are more interacting aromatic residues in the M. jannaschii C chain compared to E. coli.
C1­C2 interface

The C1­C2 interface is critical for the structural stabilization of the E. coli ATCase.36 Additional stabilization in M. jannaschii may be provided in part by more salt bridges in this interface (Table III, Fig. 6). All the hyperthermophilic trimers have a more extensive ion pair network in this interface as compared to E. coli and this is likely to increase their thermostability. CONCLUSIONS The M. jannaschii C trimer shows considerable thermostability of its activity. At 758C, it maintains 75% of its activity after 60 min. At the same temperature, the E. coli C trimer loses half of its initial catalytic activity in <1 min.14 The high stability of the M. jannaschii C trimer is reflected in the high similarity among the six monomers and in the constancy of the hinge angles among all chains in different crystalline environments. In contrast, the E. coli C trimer shows large variation in the hinge angles and disorder implying a very flexible structure in solution and high reactivity. We have analyzed a number of factors considered to be important in the thermostabilization of enzymes. Every enzyme has a unique combination of strategies. A superposition of the structure of the M. jannaschii monomer with E. coli shows strong conservation of the protein core in terms of secondary structure suggesting that this

The packing densities of the six M. jannaschii C monomers were found to be similar to each other and to the other monomers of hyperthermophilic P. abyssi and S. acidocaldarius, and mesophilic E. coli (Table III). There is no reduction of cavities in the hydrophobic core of the M. jannaschii C chain. The search for probe accessible cavities led to the identification of one cavity with aver° age volume 10.1 A3 in the 240s loop in all six monomers of the M. jannaschii C chain. This cavity is primarily hydrophobic and is lined by residues Val157, Gly158, Val224, Ile227, Tyr238, Val241, Lys242, Tyr245, Lys246,

core is already optimized for stability in the mesophilic protein. A significant difference is found in the increase of the number of salt bridges in the hyperthermophilic protein, in particular, the improvement of ion-pair networks, suggesting that this constitutes a major thermostabilization strategy. Other thermostabilizing features include shortening of the N-terminus, shortening of two loops by the absence of a Gly in each and shortening of a third loop by the absence of a thermolabile segment Ala­Asn. The M. jannaschii C chain has fewer thermolabile Gln and Asn residues, more charged Glu and Lys residues, more Tyr's and fewer Ala's in agreement with the observed trends in the relative amino acid composition of mesophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins.39 The structure is further stabilized by a sulfate bound in the central channel of each trimer through an extended ion pair network involving all three monomers. It has been shown that ammonium sulfate14 increases the thermostability of the M. jannaschii C trimer. The active site appears similar to E. coli. Upon substrate binding, smaller changes in the global orientations of domains and larger conformational changes of the active site residues are expected compared to E. coli in order to bring the active site residues closer to the active site.
