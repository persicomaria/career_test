The gold color of Staphylococcus aureus is derived from the carotenoid staphyloxanthin, a virulence factor for the organism. Here, we report the synthesis and activity of a broad variety of staphyloxanthin biosynthesis inhibitors that inhibit the first committed step in its biosynthesis, condensation of two farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) molecules to dehydrosqualene, catalyzed by the enzyme dehydrosqualene synthase (CrtM). The most active compounds are phosphonoacetamides that have low nanomolar Ki values for CrtM inhibition and are active in whole bacterial cells and in mice, where they inhibit S. aureus disease progression. We also report the X-ray crystallographic structure of the most active compound, N-3-(3-phenoxyphenyl)propylphosphonoacetamide (IC50 ) 8 nM, in cells), bound to CrtM. The structure exhibits a complex network of hydrogen bonds between the polar headgroup and the protein, while the 3-phenoxyphenyl side chain is located in a hydrophobic pocket previously reported to bind farnesyl thiodiphosphate (FsPP), as well as biphenyl phosphonosulfonate inhibitors. Given the good enzymatic, whole cell, and in vivo pharmacologic activities, these results should help guide the further development of novel antivirulence factor-based therapies for S. aureus infections.
Introduction Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus are a growing cause of concern1,2 because of the widespread development of antibiotic resistance and the shortfall in the introduction of new types of anti-infective agents. An alternative strategy that is now gaining interest is targeting of bacterial virulence factors,3-5 molecules that are essential for bacterial growth and/or invasiveness in vivo. Since these factors are by definition not essential for survival in vitro, screening for virulence factor inhibitors can be challenging. However, at least in the case of S. aureus,6,7 one important virulence factor is a brightly colored carotenoid pigment, staphyloxanthin (STXa), whose biosynthesis can be readily monitored spectrophotometrically. The carotenoid is produced by the condensation of the C15 isoprenoid farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form presqualene diphosphate and then dehydrosqualene, followed by a series of oxidations and glycosylations, in a series of reactions catalyzed by the enzymes CrtM, N, O, P,...,8 and inhibition of these enzymes (e.g., CrtN by diphenylamine) has been known for many years to result in

colorless bacteria.9,10 In later work,6 it was shown that loss of the STX pigment made S. aureus susceptible to killing by reactive oxygen species (ROS, such as H2O2, ClO-, OH) produced by neutrophils, blocking infectivity. Consequently, inhibition of staphyloxanthin biosynthesis is a potential novel target of anti-infective therapy against pigmented S. aureus strains.11-13 The first committed step in staphyloxanthin biosynthesis (Figure 1) involves the condensation of two FPP molecules to form dehydrosqualene. This reaction is thought to occur via a presqualene diphosphate intermediate and is very similar (or identical) to that catalyzed by squalene synthase (SQS) in plants, animals, and some protozoa, where the squalene so produced is then converted into sterols such as cholesterol, ergosterol, and the plant sterols. It was thus of interest to see if any of the many known SQS inhibitors previously developed as cholesterol lowering drug leads might also have activity in blocking staphyloxanthin biosynthesis and hence S. aureus virulence. We recently reported that one class of inhibitor, phosphonosulfonates, did exhibit such activity.14 The phosphonosulfonates (and related bisphosphonates) were developed earlier by Magnin et al.15,16 using FPP as a "template". The bisphosphonate analogues of FPP tended to bind to bone and also caused elevation of liver enzyme function, and the farnesyl side chain was metabolically reactive. However, the phosphonosulfonates did not have these drawbacks, and replacement of the farnesyl side chain by a diphenyl ether removed the metabolic instability. Using 1, we found good CrtM inhibition restored ROS (H2O2, neutrophil) sensitivity and, importantly, observed a major decrease in bacterial burden following S. aureus challenge in mice.14 There are, however, many other conceivable backbones (as well as side chains) that might also have good or even better

activity. To explore some of these possibilities, we were particularly interested to see if it might be possible to reduce backbone charge/acidity/polarity while still retaining CrtM activity, since this might improve inhibitor uptake into bacterial and host cells, as well as further reducing bone affinity. The possibility that less polar analogues might still have good activity is supported by the observation that, unlike bisphosphonate inhibitors of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), our published CrtM results indicated that Mg2+ binding (which usually involves binding to two anionic groups) is not essential for potent phosphonosulfonate inhibition of CrtM.14 For example, while 1 binds to CrtM with two Mg2+ (PDB file 2ZCQ), 2 binds with only one Mg2+ (PDB file 2ZCR), and 3 has no Mg2+ at all in its X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB file 2ZCS). So, unlike the situation found with FPPS, it seemed likely that a broad range of backbone structures having fewer anionic groups might be developed, since the number of metal ions involved in binding to CrtM is quite variable.

In this work, we describe the synthesis of, and inhibition by, 18 compounds encompassing the 11 basic structural motifs (a-k) shown in Figure 2 in which Ar is an aromatic fragment. Since some compounds were prepared as salts while others were free acids, these motifs are shown for simplicity in their protonated or free acid forms, a point we discuss later in the text. These motifs were designed on the basis of the following ideas: In a, we reduced the (potentially) -3 formal side chain charge found in the phosphonosulfonates (-PO3H2/-PO32-, -SO3H/-SO3-) to -2 but added a H-bond donor/acceptor amide site, a feature suggested at least in part because of synthetic accessibility. In all cases, the number of methylene groups n in the "spacer" (Figure 2) was in the range n ) 2-4, typically n ) 3, and the Ar groups were diphenyl ethers or biphenyls. In b and c we reduced the side chain formal charge to -1, but of course the sulfonic and carboxylic acids are expected to have very different pKa values. In d and e we investigated whether methyl substitutions might affect activity, while in f we investigated the effect of modifying H-bond donor ability. In g-i we further investigated the role of H-bonding, while in j, we attempted to design a novel motif that might facilitate metal binding. Finally, compound k (a phosphinomethylphosphonate) was included as a nonhydrolyzable diphosphate analogue (replacing two -O- linkages with two -CH2-). We also report the X-ray crystallographic structure of one of the most potent CrtM/STX biosynthesis inhibitors (containing motif a) bound to CrtM, which gives interesting new insights into how this compound binds to its CrtM target. Results and Discussion We synthesized a total of 18 compounds (4-21) based on the 11 motifs shown in Figure 2, and the structures of these compounds are shown in Table 1, rank-ordered in terms of decreasing activity in CrtM inhibition. The Ki values were determined by using a coupled diphosphate/phosphate release

assay,17 as described in the Experimental Section, and are also reported in Table 1. As can be seen in Table 1, the most potent inhibitors (4-6) were all diphenyl ether phosphonoacetamides (motif a, Figure 2) containing a (CH2)3 spacer between the aromatic and amide moiety and had Ki values in the range 30-70 nM, slightly greater than the 20 nM found for the lead phosphonsulfonate 1 in the same assay. The activities of these three compounds in the inhibition of STX biosynthesis in S. aureus are also shown in Table 1, from which we see that 5 is the most active compound in this bacterial cell-based assay, with an IC50 of 8 nM, much less than the IC50 of 100 nM reported for 1, due presumably to improved cellular uptake. Substitution of one and two Cl atoms on the diphenyl ether side chain had relatively little effect on CrtM inhibition but decreased bacterial STX production by 3-5× (with respect to 5) (Table 1). Shortening the (CH2)n spacer by one CH2 group (14) decreased activity in both assays (CrtM 40×; STX 400×), while lengthening the spacer by one CH2 group (16) had an even larger effect (CrtM IC50 130×, STX 400×, again versus 5). We also found that replacing the diphenyl ether side chain by a biphenyl group (10) reduced both CrtM inhibition (by 20×) and STX biosynthesis (600×) (Table 1). So the diphenyl ethers containing a (CH2)3 spacer had the most activity, both in the enzyme and in the whole bacterial cell assays. We next investigated the effects of changing the PO3H2 group to a SO3H group (Figure 2, motif b) or a -CO2H group (Figure 2, motif c). The sulfonoacetamide (11) had weak activity in both assays: a Ki ) 0.81 µM in CrtM inhibition (20× higher than 5) and an IC50 ) 15 µM in STX biosynthesis inhibition (600× higher than 5) (Table 1). The results obtained with the carboxylic acid analogue (21) in which the -PO3H group was replaced with a -CO2H group were even worse, with Ki > 7 µM and an IC50 (STX) of 200 µM, 200× and 25000× worse than with the phosphonoacetamide 5 (Table 1). So the ordering of activity is -PO3H2/-PO32- > -SO3H/-SO3- . -CO2H/-CO2- in both CrtM and STX biosynthesis inhibition, suggesting the likely importance of multiple electrostatic interactions (and/or H-bonding) between CrtM and the inhibitor's anionic group. Also of interest is the observation that, at least for the compounds where Ki values are accurately known (i.e., they are not limit values, Table 1), the cell-based activity values cover a larger range than do the CrtM enzyme inhibition results, suggesting the importance of variations in bacterial cell uptake between the different inhibitors. On the basis of these observations, we next investigated the effects of methyl substitutions on activity. In the case of the d motif, dimethyl substitution on the acetamide CH2 (13) would increase hydrophobicity, but this compound had worse CrtM activity (J20×) and much worse (J62500× versus 5) activity in STX biosynthesis, where it was essentially inactive (IC50  0.5 mM, Table 1). In the case of the N-Me substituent (Figure 2, motif e), the single methyl group on nitrogen (12) reduced activity by a factor of 20× versus 5 (to Ki ) 0.91 µM), essentially the same as that seen with the dimethyl analogue 13, but in contrast to 13, there was still measurable STX inhibition activity (IC50 ) 8.6 µM, 1000× worse than with 5). That is, the N-Me (12) and C(Me)2 (13) analogues have essentially the same activity in CrtM inhibition (0.91 and 0.96 µM, respectively), while STX biosynthesis inhibition is very different (8.6 and >500 µM for 12 and 13, respectively), supporting again the idea that the -COCH2PO3H2 group is important for cell-based activity. These results also suggested to us that the amide NH group might be important in hydrogen

Figure 1. Schematic flowchart for staphyloxanthin and cholesterol biosynthesis from farnesyl diphosphate. The first committed step in both pathways involves the head-to-head condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate to form presqualene diphosphate, catalyzed by the CrtM enzyme in S. aureus, or squalene synthase in humans. In S. aureus, dehydrosqualene is then formed via ring-opening and elimination of diphosphate; in humans, ring-opening is accompanied by an NADPH reduction step, resulting in squalene.

bonding to the protein, since the NH to NMe substitution reduced CrtM activity by 20× (Table 1).

Given the apparent importance of this region for activity, it was of interest to see if activity might be improved by conversion of the NHCO amide moiety to a hydroxamate (NOH · CO, Figure 2, motif f), which would provide alternative possibilities for H-bond formation. We made three hydroxamates, 8, 9, and 20, the first two species containing diphenyl ether side chains, the third, a biphenyl. Interestingly, both the dichloro and unsubstituted diphenyl ether phosphonohydroxamates had good activity in both CrtM and STX biosynthesis inhibition (Table 1), although they were both less active than the three most potent phosphonoacetamides. On average, the hydroxamates were 6× less active against CrtM and 2× less active in the STX biosynthesis assay (Table 1). Not unexpectedly, the biphenyl hydroxamate (20) was even less active, consistent with the weaker activity of the biphenyl phosphonoacetamide, 10. So for activity, these results indicate the importance of a phosphonoacetyl group, located in either an acetamide or a hydroxamate group, suggesting the importance of both electrostatic (H-bond) interactions between the phosphonate and the protein and, most likely, hydrogen bonding between the amide (or hydroxamate) and the protein. To test these ideas further, we next investigated motifs g-i, Figure 2, using compounds 19, 17, and 18. Surprisingly, the sulfonamide 19 had no activity in either the CrtM or STX biosynthesis assay (Table 1), suggesting a critical role for the amide/hydroxamate CO group as an H-bond acceptor. Consistent with this, neither

the ester (17) nor the ketone (18) had significant activity in either assay (Table 1). We then investigated two additional motifs, j and k in Figure 2. The hydroxamate (j, 15) had modest activity in both assays (Ki, IC50 4 µM) but was 100× (CrtM) to 500× (STX) less active than was 5. The phosphinomethylphosphonate 7 (motif k) was a potent CrtM inhibitor (Ki ) 220 nM), but again we believe, due to its increased polarity, it was 50× less effective in STX biosynthesis inhibition in whole cells than was the most potent phosphonoacetamide (5). Finally, we investigated the effects of all 18 compounds on human SQS inhibition, together with their activity in growth inhibition of three human tumor cell lines (MCF-7, NCI-460, and SF-268) (Table 1). Although inhibition of human SQS may not be a particularly important toxicologic consideration, given a choice, it would seem to be preferable to have a STX biosynthesis inhibitor with poor activity against SQS, as opposed to one with potent SQS activity, and as can be seen in Table 1, several potent CrtM inhibitors do have relatively little activity in the SQS assay. More important, in essentially all cases we find no inhibition of human cell growth (in three human cell lines, IC50 > 300 µM), supporting the idea that these compounds will have low toxicity. In fact, only the ester 17 had significant activity (IC50  70-90 µM) on human cell growth, but since this compound is inactive in STX biosynthesis inhibition, it is not likely to be of interest. Structure and Structure-Function Aspects. The results described above are of interest, since they represent the development of several new, chemically diverse virulence inhibitors for S. aureus. However, the relationships between structure and activity need to be explored in more detail in order to obtain a better understanding of how, in particular, the most active compounds act on their CrtM target. What is interesting about the most active compounds, the phosphonoacetamides, is that while they contain the same 3-(3phenoxyphenyl)propyl (PhOC6H4(CH2)3-) side chain as found in the most active phosphonosulfonates,18 the "backbone" is clearly about two bond lengths greater in the new compounds. So we next examined the effects of this common feature on binding. In the CrtM enzyme, there are two binding sites for FPP,14 and in previous work we found that phosphonosulfonates could bind to either one of these sites.14 The diphenyl ether phosphonosulfonate 1 bound to site 1 and had interactions with 2 Mg2+, while two biphenyl phosphonosulfonates (2, 3) bound to site 2 with 1 and 0 Mg2+, respectively. This observation complicates any QSAR analysis, since there could be 0, 1, or 2 Mg2+ present, and two different sites might be occupied. Plus, with the phosphonoacetamides, the presence of a longer backbone complicates the situation further, since, for example, if the diphenyl ether is located in the same region as found with 1, the headgroup will not fit. We therefore next obtained the structure of a CrtM-5 complex using X-ray crystallography to determine how 5 does in fact bind to CrtM, in order to provide a better, albeit qualitative, structure-based interpretation of the activity of one of the most potent inhibitors. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 2, and full details are given in the Experimental Section. CrtM crystallizes in the P3221 space group, and there is one molecule per asymmetric unit. The phosphonoacetamide 5 yielded well-resolved 2Fobs - Fcalc densities (Figure 3A), and the refined structure of 5 (red) is shown superimposed on FsPP (bound to CrtM) in Figure 3B and on 1-3 in Figure

3C. Interestingly, 5 binds to CrtM in a completely different manner to that observed with FsPP or any of the three phosphonosulfonates reported previously.14 Its polar phosphonate headgroup is located in the FsPP site 1, where it makes a salt bridge with Arg45 and H-bond contacts with Gln165 and Asn168, together with a complex H-bond network with five H2O molecules (Figure 4). However, unlike the situation found with 1, the diphenyl ether side chain occupies the FPP site 2. In addition, the amide CO forms H-bonds with Arg45 and two H2O molecules, and the amide NH acts as an H-bond donor to Gln165 (Figure 4B). Essentially, the increased length of 5 (over that present in the phosphonosulfonates) is accommodated in the protein by 5 "bridging" both the FPP-1 and FPP-2 binding sites (Figure 3B,C). Given this new structure (PDB 2ZY1), it is now possible to rationalize several of the SAR observations noted above. Specifically, conversion of the -PO32- group in 5 to -SO3- or -CO2- can be expected to result in the loss of many of the H-bond/electrostatic interactions with Arg45, Gln165, and Asn168 and the five H2O molecules. Second, conversion of the amide NH to NMe will prevent H-bond formation with Gln165, as will formation of an ester (17) or a ketone (18) in this region. Likewise, conversion of the amide to the hydroxamate (9) results in disruption of this H-bond interaction which may, however, be partially compensated for by other conformational changes, since 9 still retains quite good (Ki ) 320 nM) CrtM activity. But how can we correlate our enzyme inhibition results with cell based inhibition of STX biosynthesis, something that is clearly desirable because we are interested in good inhibition of virulence factor formation in cells and not just good CrtM inhibitors (which might not actually get into cells)? In Vitro and in Vivo Results. When considering all compounds investigated, we find that there is quite a good correlation between the CrtM enzyme pKi () -log10 Ki, M)

previously to the correlation, the n ) 50 compound data set exhibits a much worse correlation (Figure 5B) with an R2 ) 0.42. This is similar to the results we reported previously where we found for 10 different enzyme/cell assays that on average the R2 value for the pKi/pIC50 correlation was only 0.32 (ref 19), making any predictions of cell-based activity, based on enzyme activity, in some cases, impossible. The large discrepancies found were, we proposed, likely to be due to the neglect of factors that affect inhibitor uptake into cells, and we described a general method in which this aspect might be taken into consideration, by using a "combinatorial descriptor approach".19 That is, we described cell activity by using the following equation: pIC50(cell) ) apKi(enzyme) + bB + cC + d where a-d are linear regression coefficients and where B and C are mathematical descriptors (such as SlogP) chosen in a combinatorial manner from a large series of potential descriptors (such as the 230 descriptors in the program MOE20). Applying this same method to the combined data set (50 compounds), we now obtain (Figure 5C) R2 ) 0.68, a significant improvement. To investigate in vivo activity, we selected the most potent in vitro STX biosynthesis inhibitor (5) and carried out an intraperitoneal challenge experiment with S. aureus in exactly the same manner as reported previously for 1.14 We treated one group of mice (n ) 9) with 0.5 mg of 5 twice per day (days -1, 0, 1, and 2) and a second group (n ) 9) with equivalent volume injections of PBS control. Upon sacrificing the mice at 72 h, S. aureus bacterial counts in the kidneys of the mice treated with 5 were significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.001). The median number of colony forming units (cfu) in the untreated animals was 22 500 cfu/mL compared with 850 cfu/mL for the treated animals (Figure 6), about a 96% reduction in surviving bacteria in the treatment group. Synthetic Aspects. We outline here the synthetic schemes used to prepare 4-21; full protocols for each compound are given in the Experimental Section. A general synthetic route to the most active phosphonoacetamide and N-hydroxyacetamide (hydroxamate) compounds is shown in Scheme 1. The reaction of aldehyde 24 and sodium diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate in THF gave, after hydrogenation, compound 25 in almost quantitative yield, which after reduction with 2 equiv of LiAlH4 and AlCl3 afforded amine 26. Amine 26 was then reacted with dibenzylphosphonoacetic acid 22 in

the presence of the coupling reagent N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) to give, after hydrogenation to remove the benzyl groups, a phosphonoacetamide (e.g., 5). N-Hydroxyphosphonoacetamide compounds, such as 9, were prepared from substituted hydroxylamine 29 and diethylphosphonoacetyl chloride 23, after hydrolysis with TMSBr (to remove ethyl phosphono-esters) and hydrogenation (to remove O-benzyl protecting group), also shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 13, 11, 17, 21, 14, and 16 were made similarly, with a carbodiimide mediated amide/ester formation reaction as the main step, as shown in Scheme 2. Other compounds were made as outlined in Scheme 3. Compound 15 is an analogue of 5 but has a hydroxamate group in its side chain. Alkylation of ethyl dibenzylphosphonoacetate with iodide 28 gave compound 30, as shown in Scheme 3. The carboxylate ethyl ester was then selectively hydrolyzed (1 M KOH) and the corresponding acid coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine under standard carbodiimide conditions, followed by hydrogenation to remove three benzyl protecting groups, to give 15. Compound 18 is a -ketophosphonate analogue of 5, and its synthesis began with a Suzuki coupling reaction of an ethyl 4-pentenoate derived boron compound and 4-bromodiphenyl ether (Scheme 3), affording carboxylate ester 31. Compound 31 was then reacted with 2 equiv of lithium diethyl methylphosphonate at -78 °C to give, after TMSBr mediated hydrolysis, 18. The reaction of precursor amine 26 with methanesulfonyl chloride produced methylsulfamide 32 (Scheme 3). This was then treated with 2 equiv of butyllithium to give a dianion, which was reacted with diethyl chlorophosphate and hydrolyzed with TMSBr, resulting in the phosphonosulfamide 19. Compound 7 was made by an alkylation reaction of the dianion of triethyl methylphosphinomethylphosphonate with iodide 28, followed by hydrolysis. Conclusions The results we have described here are of interest for a number of reasons. First, we have synthesized a broad variety of inhibitors of the dehydrosqualene synthase enzyme, CrtM, exhibiting novel structural motifs. Second, we have determined their activity in CrtM inhibition and in staphyloxanthin biosynthesis in S. aureus. Third, we show that STX biosynthesis activity for a broad range of inhibitors can be predicted from enzyme inhibition results with quite good R2 values by using a combinatorial descriptor approach. Fourth, we have demonstrated that the most potent STX biosynthesis inhibitor in vitro also has activity in vivo in preventing infection. Fifth, we show that these compounds have no activity against three human cell lines. Sixth, we have obtained the X-ray crystallographic structure of the most potent STX biosynthesis inhibitor investigated here (5) bound to CrtM. The structure is unusual in that the inhibitor actually bridges the FPP-1 and FPP-2 sites observed previously,14 whereas the phosphonosulfonates reported previously bind to one or other of these sites but not to both. Many of the major changes in CrtM activity between the different motifs investigated can be interpreted in terms of the crystallographic results, opening up the way to the further development of this class of compound as novel anti-infective agents targeting inhibition of the biosynthesis of the staphyloxanthin virulence factor in S. aureus.

E. coli expressing a human SQS construct were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with kanamycin (30 µg/mL) and chloramphenicol (34 µg/mL) at 37 °C, until the cells reached an OD of 0.4 at 600 nm, and were then induced at 37 °C for 4 h by incubation with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio- -D-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 4000 rpm) and resuspended in 10 mL of lysis/elution buffer (20 mM NaH2PO3, pH 7.4, 10 mM CHAPS, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and a protease inhibitor cocktail), disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 16 000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant (40 mL) was then applied to a HiTrap nickel-chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Enzyme purification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using a Pharmacia FPLC system. Unbound protein was washed off with 50 mM imidazole, and then the His6-HsSQS was eluted with 1 M imidazole. Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A (25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10% methanol), concentrated, then stored at -80 °C. SQS activity was based on measuring the conversion of [3H]FPP to [3H]squalene. Final assay concentrations were 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 20 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CHAPS, 1% Tween-80, 10 mM DTT, 0.025 mg/mL BSA, 0.25 mM NADPH, and 7.5 ng of purified recombinant human SQS. The reaction was started with the addition of substrate (3HFPP, 0.1 nmol, 2.22 × 106 dpm), and the final volume of the reaction was 200 µL. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, an amount of 40 µL of 10 M NaOH was added to stop the reaction, followed by 10 µL of a (100:1) mixture of 98% EtOH and squalene. The resulting mixtures were mixed vigorously by vortexing. Then 10 µL aliquots were applied to 2.5 cm × 10 cm channels of a silica gel thin layer chromatogram, and newly formed squalene was separated from unreacted substrate by chromatography in toluene-EtOAc (9:1). The region of the squalene band was scraped and immersed in Hydrofluor liquid scintillation fluid and assayed for radioactivity. IC50 values were calculated from the hyperbolic plot of percent of inhibition versus inhibitor concentration, using GraphPad PRISM. Human Cell Growth Inhibition Assay. Three human cell lines MCF-7, NCI-H460, and SF-268 were obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with 100% humidity. A broth microdilution method was used to calculate IC50 values for growth inhibition by each compound. Cells were inoculated at a density of 5000 cells/well into 96-well flat-bottom culture plates containing 10 µL of the test compound, previously half-log serial diluted (from 0.316 mM to 0.1 pM) for a final volume of 100 µL. Plates were then incubated for 4 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 100% humidity, after which an MTT ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell proliferation assay (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was used to quantify cell viability. The IC50 values were obtained by fitting the OD data to a normal dose-response curve, using GraphPad PRISM. Murine Model of Kidney Infection. The 10-12 week old CD1 male mice (Charles River Laboratory) were randomized into two groups at the start of the experiment and administered either 0.5 mg of BPH-652 or PBS control, ip, twice a day, starting on day 1 to day 2 (a total of eight doses). All mice were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with 108 early stationary phase S. aureus on day 0. After 3 days, animals were euthanized, kidneys homogenized in PBS, and plated on THA for quantitative bacterial culture. Statistics. The significance of experimental differences in the mouse in ViVo challenge studies were evaluated by use of the twotailed Student's t test. X-ray Crystallography. Native CrtM was eluted from Ni-NTA beads by incubation with factor Xa (Novagen) to cleave it from

the polyhistidine-containing N-terminal thioredoxin fusion tag. The cleaved product was equilibrated with buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and then concentrated to 15 mg/mL. Native CrtM crystals (space group P3221) were grown using the hanging-drop method by mixing equal amounts of reservoir with 0.12-0.58 M potassium sodium tartrate at room temperature. BPH-830 was incorporated by soaking crystals with a solution of 5 (10 mM in DMSO) for 3 h at room temperature. X-ray diffraction data were collected at SPXF beamline BL13B1 at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan. All diffraction images were recorded using an ADSD Q210 CCD detector, and the data were indexed, integrated, and scaled by using the HKL2000 package.21 The structure of the CrtM-5 complex was determined by molecular replacement using CNS22 using the refined native CrtM (PDB 2ZCO) as a search model. Iterative cycles of model building with Xtalview23 and computational refinement with CNS were performed, in which 5% reflections were set aside for Rfree calculation.24 The stereochemical quality was assessed with the program PROCHECK.25 Figures were obtained by using Pymol.26
