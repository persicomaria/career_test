Adenosine kinase (AK) is a key purine metabolic enzyme from the opportunistic parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii and belongs to the family of carbohydrate kinases that includes ribokinase. To understand the catalytic mechanism of AK, we determined the structures of the T. gondii apo AK, AK:adenosine complex and the AK:adenosine:AMPÊ Ê Ê PCP complex to 2.55 A, 2.50 A and 1.71 A resolution, respectively. These structures reveal a novel catalytic mechanism that involves an adenosineinduced domain rotation of 30  and a newly described anion hole (DTXGAGD), requiring a helix-to-coil conformational change that is induced by ATP binding. Nucleotide binding also evokes a coil-to-helix transition that completes the formation of the ATP binding pocket. A conserved dipeptide, Gly68-Gly69, which is located at the bottom of the adenosine-binding site, functions as the switch for domain rotation. The synergistic structural changes that occur upon substrate binding sequester the adenosine and the ATP gi phosphate from solvent and optimally posÊ ition the substrates for catalysis. Finally, the 1.84 A resolution structure of an AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP complex reveals the basis for the higher af®nity binding of this prodrug over adenosine and thus provides a scaffold for the design of new inhibitors and subversive substrates that target the T. gondii AK.

Introduction
Toxoplasma gondii is an ubiquitous parasitic protozoan that infects up to one-third of the US population and up to 90 % of certain European populations. Risk factors for infection include exposure to infected cats, consumption of rare meats and contact with contaminated soil. T. gondii infections are usually asymptomatic in healthy individuals. However, infection in neonates and immunocompromised persons can have devastating consequences. Indeed, T. gondii is the leading cause of congenital neurological birth defects

(Daffos et al., 1994; McAuley et al., 1994) and a prominent opportunistic infection associated with immunocompromising conditions such as AIDS (Fernandez-Martin et al., 1991; Mariuz et al., 1994). Unfortunately, the current standard therapy for T. gondii infection, a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, can result in severe side effects, such as bone marrow suppression (Leport et al., 1987; Brooks et al., 1987; Dannemann et al., 1992; Luft & Remington, 1992). The need for new chemotherapeutics active against T. gondii is therefore acute. Selective drug therapy necessitates the exploitation of fundamental biochemical differences between the pathogen and the host. Like all parasitic protozoans, T. gondii cannot synthesize purine bases de novo (Krug et al., 1989). Enzymes of the T. gondii purine salvage pathway are, therefore, absolutely required for parasite survival, and thus

550 represent attractive targets for structure-based drug design. The two most important enzymes in T. gondii that salvage preformed purine bases are adenosine kinase (AK) and hypoxanthine-guaninexanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGXPRTase) (Krug et al., 1989). The ability to isolate mutant T. gondii de®cient in either AK or HGXPRTase demonstrates that neither AK nor HGXPRTase is essential by itself (Pfefferkorn & Pfefferkorn, 1978; Pfefferkorn & Borotz, 1994; Donald et al., 1996; Sullivan et al., 1999). However, the failure to obtain mutants de®cient in both enzymes implies that AK and HGXPRTase are the entire complement of purine salvage enzymes in this parasite (Darling, personal communication). Thus, structure based drug design targetting these two enzymes should prove highly ef®cacious. Drugs that inhibit purine salvage offer one rational paradigm, while an alternative strategy is to utilize subversive purine substrates or prodrugs that are speci®cally metabolized into cytotoxic nucleotide analogs. The T. gondii AK is a 363-residue (39.3 kDa) monomeric protein (Sullivan et al., 1999) that catalyzes the transfer of the g, phosphate group from ATP to adenosine to form ADP and AMP. The Km for adenosine is 1.9 mM and for ATP, 54.4 mM (Darling et al., 1999). AK displays a catalytic activity tenfold higher than any other T. gondii purine enzyme (Krug et al., 1989), including HGXPRTase, which arguably makes AK the most important purine salvage enzyme of this parasite. To date, AK sequences from only a few organisms have been reported to date (Sullivan et al., 1999). Comparison of the T. gondii sequence with the other sequences reveals that the T. gondii AK is more divergent and shares less than 30 % sequence identity with the AK of its nearest neighbor, Dictyostelium discoideum. A signi®cant difference between the T. gondii AK and the other AK sequences is the presence of an insertion between residues 250 to 270 in the T. gondii AK, which is not found in the primary structures of other AKs. AK belongs to the family of carbohydrate kinases, called the ribokinase family, whose members can be identi®ed by strong sequence homology located within two short stretches of sequence called ``boxes'' (Wu et al., 1991; Bork et al., 1993). The ®rst sequence box is located near the N terminus of these proteins and contains a highly conserved di-glycine repeat, while the second box is near the C terminus and contains a conserved DTXGAGD motif. In addition to AK, this family includes ribokinase (RK), ketohexokinase, fructokinase, 2-dehydro-3-deoxygluconokinase, 1-phosphofructokinase and the minor 6-phosphofructokinase. The structures of two members of the ribokinase family have been determined recently: the Escherichia coli RK-ribose-ADP complex (Sigrell et al., 1998), apo RK and RK-ribose complex (Sigrell et al., 1999) and the human AK in complex with adenosine (Mathews et al., 1998). Despite limited sequence identity outside the two boxes, the core structures of the dimeric E. coli RK and monomeric

human AK are remarkably similar, with each protomer consisting of two domains: a large a/b domain and a small domain. The small domain of AK has an a/b structure whilst in RK it is a b sheet, which serves not only as a lid over the active site as in AK, but also as the primary dimerization interface. The substrates and products of each enzyme are bound at the domain interfaces. An overlay of the apo and ribose-bound RK structures reveals a 17  rotation of its small and large domains that serves to create the ATP binding site. However, beyond this ribose-induced closure of its small and large domains, only small tertiary structural changes are found among the apo, ribose and ribose:ADP-bound enzyme forms, and many aspects of its catalytic mechanism are still unclear (Sigrell et al., 1999). Similarly, the structure of the human AK:adenosine complex, although providing some insight into substrate binding, left many questions about its catalytic mechanism unanswered; the pertinent biochemical data regarding the enzymatic mechanism are equivocal and controversial, and thus, this structure could not resolve all issues (Henderson et al., 1972; Palella et al., 1980; Rotllan et al., 1985; Hawkins et al., 1987; Bhaumik et al., 1988). In order to understand better the structural and mechanistic basis for phosphate transfer by this class of carbohydrate kinases, we determined the Ê structures of the T. gondii apo AK to 2.55 A resolÊ ution, the AK:adenosine complex to 2.50 A resolution, and the AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP (a nonhydrolysable ATP analog) ternary complex to Ê 1.71 A resolution. These structures reveal the enzymatic mechanism of phosphotransfer by AK, which involves a 30  hinge bending of the domains and helix formation and unfolding. These structural changes are essential for the precise positioning of both the adenosine and ATP substrates and key catalytic residues. The residues involved in adenosine or ribose substrate binding and catalysis are highly conserved among the otherwise non-homologous ribokinase family, and therefore suggest a common catalytic mechanism in this Ê class of carbohydrate kinases. Finally, the 1.84 A resolution structure of AK bound to AMP-PCP and the subversive substrate, 7-iodotubercidin, reveals the atomic basis for high-af®nity prodrug binding and provides a scaffold for structure-based drug design of speci®c T. gondii AK inhibitors and subversive substrates.

adenosine kinases of other species, are disordered in all four of the AK structures. It should be noted that this disordered insertion is far from the active site (Figure 1(a)). Like the human homologue, the T. gondii AK structure contains a mixed fold and consists of a small and large domain (Figure 1(b)). The small domain includes the non-contiguous elements, b2-a1-b3-a2-b4 and b7-b8. The large domain contains a more typical a/b structure and includes b1, a3-b5-a4-b6, a5-b9-a6-b10-a7-a8-b11a9-a10-b12-b13-b14-a11-a12 (Figure 1(b)). A search of the PDB using the DALI server (Holm & Sander, 1993) failed to identify any signi®cant structural similarity (Z 5 2.0) to any other kinase, including the functionally related nucleotide kinases, thymidylate kinase and adenylate kinase, with the expected exception of the human AK (Z  47) and E. coli RK (Z  32) structures. Attempts to soak substrates into crystals of the apo form of the enzyme were unsuccessful. Therefore, to gain insight into substrate and prodrug recognition by this enzyme and more importantly into its catalytic mechanism, we co-crystallized and determined the structures of the T. gondii AK:adenosine, AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP (Figure 1(c)) and AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP complexes. These complexes crystallize isomorphously and their overall structures are essentially identical with Ê root-mean-squared deviations (rmsd) of 0.48 A and Ê 0.36 A for pairwise comparison of residues 12

to 250 and 275 to 356 of the AK:adenosine and AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP complexes to the AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP complex, respectively (Figure 1(d)). Selected crystallographic data and an analysis of the stereochemical parameters for each complex are given in Table 1. As in the apo enzyme, electron density for residues 11 to 254 and 271 to 358 is readily found in each complex. Electron density for both the adenosine and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PCP, are clearly resolved in the AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP structure (Figure 2(a)). As observed in the human AK:adenosine structure (1BX4), there are two bound adenosines in the AK:adenosine complex with the second adenosine molecule bound where the adenosine moiety of the AMP-PCP binds, i.e. the ATP binding site. This ®nding is consistent with kinetic studies, which show that at high concentrations, adenosine functions as a competitive inhibitor of ATP (Fisher et al., 1984). In the structure of the AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP complex, electron density for the iodine atom of this subversive substrate was readily evident and located within a hydrophobic patch of the adenosine-binding pocket (Figure 2(b)). Comparison of the AK:substrate structures to that of the apo AK reveals dramatic conformational changes that accompany ligand binding. Most striking is a 30  hinge bending motion that the small and large domains undergo, which in the

adenosine-bound state results in domain closure. This is a rigid body rotation, and the structures of the two domains, with two important exceptions, remain essentially unchanged. The rmsd values are Ê Ê 1.0 A and 1.4 A when comparing the small (residues 20-65; 127-140) and large domains (residues 12-19; 145-358) of the substrate-bound protein and the apo enzyme, respectively. A similar, but signi®cantly smaller domain rotation (17  ) is induced by substrate binding to RK (Sigrell et al., 1999). The smaller magnitude of the RK motion could be as a result of its dimeric state, which could stiffen the protein, or could re¯ect an RK catalytic mechanism that is similar, but not identical, to that of AK. Domain rotation and the local conformational changes, which are induced in the T. gondii AK by adenosine and AMP-PCP binding, are synergistic and set the stage for catalysis (see below). Adenosine binding and domain closure In the apo structure, residues Leu46, Leu142, Tyr169 and Phe201 line the open pocket of the nascent adenosine-binding pocket and likely provide a hydrophobic surface to trap the substrate. In the adenosine-bound conformation, these residues are brought into apposition to form the hydrophobic core of the adenosine-binding site with the nucleoside wedged tightly between the two domains and sequestered from bulk solvent. However, the binding environments of the ribose ring and adenine base are different (Figure 3(a)). There are no signi®cant differences in adenosine binding (described below) between the AK:adenosine and AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP structures and discussion of adenosine binding is limited to that observed in the latter

structure. The substrate contacts for all three AK:substrate complexes are listed in Tables 2, 3 and 4. The adenosyl ribose points into the core of the protein and serves to anchor the substrate in the binding pocket by engaging in multiple hydrogen bonds with the enzyme. The side-chains of three residues, one from the small domain, Asp24, and two from the large domain, Asn73 and Asp318, make direct contacts to the ribose (Figure 3(a); Tables 2 and 3). The side-chain of Asp24 hydrogen bonds to both the O2H and O3H ribose hydroxyl groups, whereas the Nd2 of Asn73 contacts the O3H hydroxyl group. In addition, the backbone amide nitrogen of Gly69 hydrogen bonds to the O2H hydroxyl group. Steric complementarity and the hydrogen-bonding network around the ribosyl O2H and O3H hydroxyl groups clari®es the dramatic reduction in binding upon substitution of these groups. Replacement of the O2H hydroxyl group by a methoxy group abolishes binding while substitution with a hydrogen results in a 600-fold reduction (Iltzsch et al., 1995). The corresponding replacements at the 3H -position result in a 150-fold reduction in binding and a complete abolition of binding, respectively. The tighter protein-substrate ®t around the 2H -binding site explains the larger effect observed with the methoxy group replacement. In accord with the structure, the opposite is true for the 3H -binding pocket where a methoxy group could ®t into the surrounding pocket without steric clash, while a hydrogen atom would create an energetically less favorable cavity (Figure 3(a)). The ribosyl O5H oxygen atom makes a hydrogen bond to the side-chain of Asp318 that stabilizes this exocyclic hydroxyl atom in an

In (b) and (c) the large domains of the two structures have been oriented identically to draw attention to the large substrate-induced conformational changes, including domain closure and helical folding transitions. These changes are highlighted in yellow. The a helices are labelled a1 to a12 and the b strands are labelled b1 to b14 (following Mathews et al., 1998). a helices and their residues are a1 (31-36); a2 (53-61); a3 (70-81); a4 ( 98-110); a5 (155-158); a6 (176-187); a7 (201-205); a8 (207-215); a9 (224-235); a10 (242-253); a11 (312-330 in apo AK and 316-330 the AK complexes); and a12 (334-354). The b strands and their residues are b1 (14-21); b2 (22-29); b3 (43-47); b4 (64-66); b5 (88-95); b6 (113-119); b7 (126-132); b8 (135-141); b9 (163-167); b10 (192-196); b11 (219-222); b12 (274-279); b13 (284-290); and b14 (294-297). Note that the disordered insertion is located between a10 and b12. There are three 310 helices (unlabelled) in the apo form of the T. gondii AK and four 310 helices in the AK-substrate complexes. The three common 310 helices include 310 helix 1, which contains residues 49-52 and immediately precedes a2; 310 helix 2, composed of residues 142-147, and located between b8 and a5 and 310 helix 3 from residues 169-173 and located between b9 and a6.

extended conformation, which in turn appears to stabilize the ribose sugar pucker in the O4H -endo conformation rather than in the more common and energetically favorable C2H or C3H -endo conformation. The hydrogen bond between the carboxylate group of Asp318 and the O5H hydroxyl group, which is the phosphate acceptor, strongly implicates this residue as the general base that functions in proton abstraction during catalysis. Unlike the ribose group, the adenosyl adenine is bound in a more solvent-accessible area of the binding site surrounded by several solvent mol-

ecules which aid in recognition and binding of the purine ring (Figure 3(a); Tables 2 and 3). Speci®cally, two water molecules, Wat1 and Wat2, help anchor the adenine ring in the pocket, and a chloride ion makes van der Waals contacts to the C2 atom of the base (Tables 2, 3 and 4). The assignment of the chloride ion was justi®ed primarily by the low B-factor resulting from its re®nement as a water molecule and by a chloride ion that is observed in the same location in the human AK:adenosine complex (Mathews et al., 1998). The chloride ion is anchored by the positive dipole of

the N terminus of a3 and numerous protein-ion contacts, including those from the amide nitrogens of Asn20 and Ala71 and the Og1 of Thr167 (O-ClÀ, Ê 3.2 A). The physiological importance of this anion, if any, is unknown. The exocyclic amino group, N6, is engaged in water-mediated protein hydrogen bonds through Wat1 and Wat2. Wat2 links N6 Ê to the Og of Thr172 (Og-O, 3.0 A) and the carbonyl Ê oxygen atom of Tyr169 (CO-O, 2.8 A), while Wat1 links this exocyclic amine to the carbonyl oxygen Ê atom of Thr45 (CO-O, 3.1 A). Wat1 also hydrogen bonds to N7. Three direct protein-adenine hydrogen bonds are formed between the amide nitrogen atom of Ser70 and the purine ring nitrogen N3, the Og of Thr140 and adenine N7, and the Nd2 of Asn20 and the N1 nitrogen atom. Additional binding energy is provided by stacking and van der Waals interactions between the adenine ring and Ile22 from the small domain and Tyr169 from the large domain. The hydrogen-bonding network surrounding the adenine ring reveals the chemical basis of discrimination by AK against inosine, xanthosine and guanosine as substrates (Iltzsch et al., 1995). Such discrimination is achieved by the solvent molecule, Wat1, the two hydrogen bond donors of which are taken, one by the carbonyl oxygen atom of Thr45 and the other by the purine ring N7 (Figure 3(a)). Thus, only the hydrogen bond acceptors of Wat1 are left to interact with the exocyclic 6 position of the purine, thereby effectively precluding 6-oxopurine bases.

The 7-iodotubercidin binding replaces Wat1 In addition to adenosine, a number of nucleoside analogues can be used as substrates by T. gondii AK (Iltzsch et al., 1995). Very effective substrate analogues are characterized by large, hydrophobic groups or atoms bound directly either to C6 of the purine ring, e.g. 6-iodopurine riboside, or the exocyclic 6 amino group, e.g. N6-(p-methoxybenzoyl) adenosine. A second group of good substrate analogs involves modi®cation of the 7 position of the purine ring, e.g. 7-iodo-7-deazaadenosine (7-iodotubercidin). 7-iodotubercidin is a powerful subversive substrate of the T. gondii AK, displaying higher af®nity for the T. gondii AK than any other nucleoside substrate tested, including the substrate adenosine (Iltzsch et al., 1995). At face value, these kinetic data appear to be paradoxical in the light of the ®nding that the N6 and N7 positions are critical for speci®c ligand binding and discrimination against inosine and other 6-oxopurine bases. However, the N6 and N7 atoms of the purine ring face the solvent-bound region of the binding site, which interestingly is also strongly hydrophobic. A potential explanation for these binding data is that the bound water molecules of the substrate binding site, in particular Wat1, can be ``replaced'' with other substituents, a strong possibility considering that these water molecules are not found in the

apo structure and thus appear to be acquired upon adenosine binding. To establish the high-af®nity binding mechanism of 7-iodotubercidin, the structure of the AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP ternary complex was solved. Indeed, the high-af®nity binding of this prodrug lies in great part with the displacement of Wat1 by the 7-iodo atom. However, because of the large atomic radius of the iodine atom, the surrounding hydrophobic cavity of the substrate-binding pocket is ®lled optimally, and numerous favorable interactions are made between the iodine atom and enzyme (Figures 1(d) and 2(b); Table 4). The hydrophobic cavity is created by the side-chains of residues Ala44 and Leu46 from the small domain and Cys127, Leu138, Thr140, Tyr169 and Phe201 from the large domain. Interestingly, the conformations of these side-chains are identical, regardless of which substrate, either adenosine or 7-iodotubercidin, is bound. Such side-chain rigidity would thermodynamically favor the steric complementarity and resulting van der Waals contacts of the prodrug over the natural nucleoside substrate, which although engaged in productive hydrogen bonds, must freeze at least two water molecules to bind. That the larger atomic radius of the iodine atom provides an optimal ®t in the pocket is consistent with kinetic studies which show that 7chlorotubercidin binds T. gondii AK with a sixfold lower af®nity than 7-iodotubercidin and that tuber-

cidin binds with a 21-fold lower af®nity (Iltzsch et al., 1995). Thus, the structure of this complex reveals how 7-iodotubercidin binds the T. gondii AK with such high af®nity and provides insight into the development of new subversive substrates and high af®nity inhibitors.

AMP-PCP and Mg2 binding and helical transitions The ATP binding site was identi®ed unambiguously by the location of the bound non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PCP (Figure 1(c)). The binding pocket is located entirely within the large domain of the enzyme and is characterized by a number of water molecules that mediate interactions between this substrate and protein (Figure 3(b)). However, only one direct contact is made between the protein and the adenine ring and involves the side-chain amide Ne2 group of Gln346 and adenine N3 (Figure 3(b); Table 3). Interestingly, unlike the exocyclic 6-amino group of the adenosine substrate, the corresponding group of the AMP-PCP makes no speci®city-determining interactions with the enzyme, suggesting that GTP should function equally well as ATP as the phosphate donor in the reaction. Kinetic studies on the T. gondii enzyme have con®rmed this posit (J.A. Darling & M.A.S., unpublished data).

In contrast to the adenine ring, a large number of direct and water-mediated contacts are made between the protein and AMP-PCP ribose and phosphate groups (Figure 3(b) and Table 3). Similar to the mechanism of adenosine substrate binding, the AMP-PCP ribose ring is anchored tightly to the protein. Two contacts are provided by the side-chain amide Nd atom of Asn342, which interacts with both the O2H and O3H ribosyl hydroxyl groups. The O3H hydroxyl group is further anchored by a water molecule (Wat3) that also contacts the amide nitrogen atom of Arg279 and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly280 and Pro283. This hydrogen bond network is critical in stabilizing the loop formed by residues 278 to 283 that encircles one side of the AMP-PCP molecule. The ribosyl ring oxygen atom O4H is not involved in any hydrogen bonds but directly abuts the sidechain of Ala345, thereby explaining the high conservation of a small residue at this position within the ribokinase family (Bork et al., 1993; Wu et al., 1991). Finally, the exocyclic O5H oxygen atom does not make any direct protein contacts but is part of the water coordination sphere of a bound solvent

that was designated as a magnesium ion on the basis of its well behaved thermal parameter re®nement (Figure 3(b)). This ion does not display the commonly observed octahedral coordination normally seen for magnesium. However, inspection of difference electron density maps revealed no other clear peaks that could be attributed to magnesium hexacoordination. The location of the magnesium ion between the ah and ba phosphates is unusual and differs from several other kinases in which the cation is located between the b and g phosphates (Matte et al., 1998). Beyond charge neutralization, the functional relevance of this cation binding position, if any, is unclear. Additional interactions between the enzyme and the a phosphate oxygen atoms include hydrogen bonds between O2A and the Og hydroxyl groups of Thr278 and between O1A to the amide nitrogen atom of Gly280. The O3A anionic oxygen atom contacts the amide nitrogen atom of Gly317. The magnesium ion is close to the adenine ring N7 nitrogen atom (Figure 3(b)) and a water molecule that is engaged in a hydrogen bond to the adenine exocyclic N6 atom, thereby

effectively bridging the phosphate and adenyl moieties of the ATP analog. Upon ATP binding, the protein undergoes striking local structural changes, foremost of which are the formation of a short 310 helix from residues 307 to 310 and the concomitant unfolding of residues 312 to 316 of the N terminus of helix a11 (Figure 1). Both transitions are induced directly by the binding of the b and g phosphates of the ATP. The helix-to-coil transition leads to the formation of the anion hole of this kinase. As a result, the b and g phosphate groups are now surrounded by the new N terminus of a11 and residues of the newly created anion hole, and are involved in several direct and water-mediated protein-substrate contacts (Table 3 and 4, and Figure 3(b)). A key substratestabilizing contact is provided by small domain residue Arg136, which interacts with both the O2G and O3G atoms of the g phosphate. This basic residue is highly conserved amongst the ribokinase Ê family and is translocated 13.7 A into the active site upon the adenosine-induced domain closure (Figure 1(c)). In the human AK:adenosine structure, the corresponding arginine, Arg132, is pointing out of the active site pocket due to the absence of an ATP analog g phosphate. By contrast, a sul-

fate ion in the T. gondii AK:adenosine structure, which is a component of the crystallization solution, functionally mimics the g phosphate in attracting and orienting the Arg136 side-chain (Figure 1(d)). The positive helix dipole of a11 also plays a favorable role in binding the AMP-PCP phosphate groups. Additional contacts between ATP and AK are inferred by the proximity of the C3B atom of the AMP-PCP analog, which replaces the O3A oxygen atom of ATP, to the amide nitrogen atoms of Ala316 and Gly317 (Table 3 and 4). Comparison of T. gondii and human AK structures The structures of the human and T. gondii AK:adenosine complexes allow us the opportunity to exploit their differences in the development of drugs targetted speci®cally against the parasite enzyme. Although the sequences of the human and T. gondii AK are less than 28 % identical, not unexpectedly their overall global structures are similar. Superposition of the human AK:adenosine structure onto the T. gondii AK:adenosine:AMPÊ PCP structure results in an rmsd of 1.3 A for 319 corresponding Ca atoms, which include T. gondii

560 AK residues 11-59; 60-80; 81-150; 154-189; 191-251; 271-289; 295-351 and human AK residues 5-53; 5575; 77-146; 155-190; 191-251; 258-276; 277-339. However, a number of structural differences are found between the two enzymes, which contribute to the slightly in¯ated calculated rmsd. Perhaps most signi®cant is the lack of the formation of the anion hole in the human AK structure, which therefore resembles the T. gondii apo AK in having an extra turn of helix at a11. This is consistent with the lack of the b or g phosphate group (or a sulphate ion as seen in the T. gondii AK:adenosine complex) which are needed to induce the formation of this structure. Examination of the substrate binding pockets of the human and T. gondii enzymes reveals that the adenosine binding sites are structurally conserved (Figure 4(a)). Strikingly, the water networks surrounding the adenine moieties are identical, suggesting that the architecture of the adenosinebinding site of the two enzymes is fashioned for the binding of an adenosine-water complex. Neither enzyme makes direct contacts to the N6 and N7 atoms of the adenine base, thereby permitting the high-af®nity binding of a number of pharmacologically important nucleoside analogs that have large substituents at these base positions, e.g. 7-iodotubercidin. However, the presence of a water molecule in the adenosine binding site of both proteins discriminates against the naturally occurring 6-oxopurine nucleosides, inosine, guanosine and xanthosine. In sharp contrast, a comparison of the ATP binding site of the human and T. gondii enzymes reveals that they are quite different (Figure 4(b)). This structural dissimilarity is most notable in the site around the adenine moiety. In fact, there are no conserved protein-adenine contacts between the two enzymes, and the water networks surrounding the ATP binding sites are totally different. Such dramatic differences render the ATP binding site an attractive region to exploit in the development of T. gondii-speci®c subversive substrates and inhibitors. Novel kinase mechanism: the GG switch, substrate sequestration and creation of the anion hole Previous biochemical studies on the catalytic mechanism of AK from multiple species are equivocal (Palella et al., 1980; Rotllan et al., 1985; Hawkins et al., 1987; Bhaumik et al., 1988). However, most agree on two key points concerning the mechanism. Firstly, no evidence supports the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate during AK catalysis and secondly, the reaction is ordered, with adenosine binding ®rst, followed by ATP binding. Consistent with these ®ndings, the structure of the T. gondii AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP reveals no evidence for the formation of a covalent substrate-enzyme intermediate. The suggestion of an ordered mechanism is also consistent with our structures, which reveal that adenosine binding

This superposition reveals the non-conserved nature of the ATP contacts of these enzymes, particularly to the adenine moiety.

induces a domain rotation of 30  that not only encases the adenosine substrate but also translocates the key ATP-binding residue, Arg136, into the active site. This suggests strongly that adenosine binding is a prerequisite for ATP binding.

561 CO-ribose steric clash, is found. A possible explanation for the apparent lack of a GG switching mechanism in RK is that during crystallization, the apo enzyme is trapped in the ``closed'' conformation (Sigrell et al., 1998) by packing forces, thereby obscuring the full switching mechanism. The resulting GG switch mechanism triggers the entire domain rotation by displacing helix a1, which is located at the periphery of the small domain. The remainder of the small domain rotates to maintain the ``knobs-in-hole'' arrangement between a1 and a2, as well as the b sheet arrangement (Figure 6(a) and (b)). The resultant ``closed'' conformation is stabilized by the multiple interactions between residues of the small and large domains and the adenosine molecule. Most hinge bending proteins appear to display a dynamic equilibrium between their open and closed states, the latter of which is stabilized by ligand binding. The triggered mechanism in AK, utilizing the GG switch, suggests that the domain closure of this enzyme may be adenosine-binding dependent. The ®nal striking feature of the adenosine-induced GG conformational switch and resulting domain closure is the total occlusion of the adenosine and gm mphosphate of the ATP, thereby protecting the developing transition state from nucleophilic attack by the bulk solvent (Figure 6(c)). The GG conformational switch provides the gross structural changes to place the enzyme in its precatalytic conformation. However, these are insuf®cient for catalysis. Additional local structural changes, induced by the binding of ATP, are needed. Key are the coil-to-helix transition of residues 307-310 and the concomitant helix-to-coil transition of the N-terminal residues, 312-316, of a11. Speci®cally, it is the interaction of the enzyme with the b and g phosphates and the adenine moiety of the ATP substrate that bring about these secondary structure switches (Figures 1(c) and 5(b)). As a result of these transitions, an extensive anion hole is created (Figure 5(b)). The best-characterized kinase anion hole is the mononucleotide binding motif or P-loop, which contains the consensus sequence GXX(G/X)XGK(S/T) (Saraste et al., 1990). This motif is observed in a number of enzymes È including adenylate kinase (Muller & Schulz, 1992; Kinoshita, et al., 1999; Matte et al., 1988), RecA (Story & Steitz, 1992), elongation factor Tu (Berchtold et al., 1993) and p21ras (Muegge et al., 1996). The protein kinases have a related P-loop de®ned by the sequence, XGXGX(F/Y)GXV (Smith et al., 1999). The AK sequence, DTNGAGD, is completely different, and thus de®nes a new kinase anion hole motif, the structure of which is modulated by ATP binding (Figure 5(b)). Notably, this region encompasses the second ribokinase ®ngerprint region of the ribokinase family and is the most highly conserved region among these proteins. Thus, it is predicted that this region will form the anion hole in all ribokinase family members.

The structures of the T. gondii apo AK and AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP ternary complex, which closely precedes the transition state, have provided detailed insight into the three-dimensional mechanism of the phosphotransfer reaction catalyzed by all adenosine kinases, as well as corroborate, contrast and expand on the recent studies on ribokinase. These structures document the dramatic structural changes, both global and local, that occur during catalysis, and provide one of the few complete structural characterizations of the catalytic mechanism of a kinase. The ®rst requirement of catalysis is the hingebending motion (Korn & Rose, 1994; Wriggers & Schulten, 1999). Such a large conformational change is not unique to AK and has been observed in other kinases (Cox et al., 1994), including RK (Sigrell et al., 1999) and proteins that are involved in other catalytic events, metabolite transport, intramolecular signalling, macromolecular assembly, transcription regulation and cellular locomotion. Typically, these motions are characterized by a large change in the main-chain torsion angles of a small number of residues that comprise the hinge. Understanding the underlying cause of the hinge bending in AK would elucidate a key component of the AK catalytic mechanism. Clearly, one or more torsion angles of residues 21-23, 67-69, 121-125 and 143-145, which separate the small and large domains of the enzyme, must change signi®cantly to evoke the hinge bending. Comparison of their apo and adenosine:AMP-PCP-bound f,c dihedral angles reveals only residues Gly68 and Gly69 undergo the large torsional changes necessary for hinge bending (Figure 5(a)). These residues correspond to the conserved GG motif, which is found within the ®rst ®ngerprint box of the ribokinase family (Bork et al., 1993; Wu et al., 1991), and the critical role that only a small, conformationally ¯exible residue can play in this part of the mechanism of substrate binding explains their absolute conservation. The reason for the change in the torsion angles of these glycine residues is clear when the large domains of the apo enzyme and ternary complex are superimposed. In the ternary complex structure, the Gly-Gly dipeptide forms the base of the binding site for one face of the adenosine ribose (Figure 5(a)). If this dipeptide were to maintain its apo enzyme conformation, the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly69 would clash with the ribose ring Ê Ê Ê (CO-C4H , 2.6 A; CO-O3H , 2.8 A; CO-C1H , 2.9 A; COH Ê ). Thus the ribose ring ¯ips the Gly68O4 , 3.0 A Gly69 conformational switch to avoid this steric clash. Because all members of the ribokinase family bind sugar-containing substrates, a similar ``sugarinduced'' ¯ip of their GG conformational switches would be expected. Indeed, residues Gly41 and Gly42, the putative GG switch of ribokinase, undergo signi®cant dihedral changes upon ribose binding (Sigrell et al., 1999), although it was not possible to ascertain if the conformational switch ¯ipping mechanism, i.e. relief of a possible Gly42

(b) Stereo view of the DTnGAGD ®ngerprint motif (residues 312-318) de®nes a novel anion hole. The overlaid DTnGAGD motifs of the apo enzyme (magenta) and adenosine:AMP-PCP complex (light blue) reveal the helical unfolding that occurs upon ATP binding, leading to the creation of the g phosphate-binding anion hole.

The result of these synergistic substrate-induced structural changes in AK is the optimal juxtaposition of the substrates for catalysis and the creation of the proper environment for the reaction between the adenosine 5H -hydroxyl oxygen atom and the ATP g phosphate. The active site geometry in the ternary structure reveals all the necessary components for phosphoryl transfer, which is most consistent with an associative SN2 type mechanism (Figure 6(b)). In support of such a mechanism is the short distance between the adenosine 5H -

hydroxyl oxygen atom and the g phosphate group Ê of AMP-PCP (3.0 A). Furthermore, the side-chain of the family-wide conserved acidic residue, Asp318, is well positioned for proton abstraction of the adenosine 5H -hydroxyl group. The corresponding residue is Asp300 in human AK and Asp255 in RK. In turn the adenosine 5H -hydroxyl group is positioned optimally for an in-line nucleophilic attack on the ATP g phosphorous atom. A water molecule that contacts the O1B b phosphate oxygen atom is the likely proton donor to the ADP

564 ation of the negatively charged phosphoryl group during transfer from ATP to adenosine include those between the guanidinium moiety of residue Arg136 (Arg132 in human AK) and g phosphate, the positive helix dipole of a11 and the g phosphate and multiple hydrogen bonds with anion hole amide backbone atoms and the g phosphate group (Table 3). These electrostatically positive elements would also help catalysis by increasing the electrophilicity of the g phosphate group. Mg2 coordination of the a phosphate group would also help neutralise the catalytic pocket. Interestingly, the RK residue that corresponds to the T. gondii AK Arg136 is an asparagine residue. However, RK residue Lys43 appears to be the functional equivalent of this arginine residue and again underscores the subtle differences between the catalytic mechanisms of RK and AK. One major difference between AK and RK is the fact that RK is a dimer and utilizes residues from the anion hole of one monomer to aid in the formation of the lid of the other monomer. In contrast, a single subunit in AK is suf®cient to form the lid. Such interactions in RK might also explain the ®nding that the anion hole of RK, which is structurally equivalent to the anion hole in T. gondii, is preformed in all RK structures, even in the absence of a g phosphate group. Thus, the oligomeric state of the members of the ribokinase family might be important in the catalytic mechanism inasmuch as it may determine the extent of the anion hole induction.

tic mechanisms. The nearly complete mechanistic description revealed by these structures is most consistent with an associative phosphoryl transfer mechanism and presents AK as an excellent system for studying enzyme-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer. Finally, the high activity of AK along with the distinctive features of adenosine metabolism in T. gondii make this enzyme a very attractive target for new chemotherapeutics. The high resolution structures of the T. gondii AK:substrate and adenosine:7-iodotubercidin complexes have provided the structural scaffolds that are essential for such endeavors.

Methods and Materials
Crystallization The T. gondii AK was puri®ed as described (Darling et al., 1999) and crystallized in the apo form using hanging drop-vapour diffusion methods. Protein at 35.0 mg/ ml was mixed with an equal volume of the crystallization reagent (1.75 M NH4(SO4), 0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5) and equilibrated against 1 ml of the crystallization reagent at room temperature. Crystals appear within one day to one month and grow as small plates with typical dimensions of 0.4 mm Â 0.1 mm Â 0.02 mm. The crystals are monocliÊ nic and take space group P21 with a  47.1 A, Ê Ê b  68.0 A, c  56.8 A and b  100.8  . There is one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Although the crystals Ê grow as small plates, they diffract to 2.5 A resolution using in-house X-ray sources. Attempts to soak substrates into the crystals were unsuccessful. Therefore, crystals of the AK:adenosine complex were obtained via the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method by mixing AK (10 mg/ml), with 5 mM adenosine, with the reservoir (1.1 M LiSO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5)) and equilibrating against 1 ml of reservoir at room temperature. The crystals grew within two to four weeks and are orthorhombic, space group P21,21,2, with Ê Ê Ê a  167.8 A, b  47.1 A, c  44.4 A. There is a monomer per asymmetric unit. Crystals of the AK:adenosine:AMPPCP and AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP ternary complexes, which are isomorphous to the AK:adenosine crystals, were obtained using solutions of AK at 10 mg/ ml and 5 mM AMP-PCP with either 5 mM adenosine or 7-iodotubercidin and the same crystallization reagents and conditions as those used in the crystallization of the AK:adenosine complex. Data collection X-ray intensity data for apo AK were collected at À180  C. The crystal was cryoprotected by a quick dip of a crystal-containing cryoloop in a solution composed of the reservoir supplemented with 50 % (w/v) glycerol. The apo AK data were collected using an R-AXIS IV imaging plate system and a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode X-ray generator equipped with double focussing mirrors and operating at 50 kV and 100 mA (Table 1). The data were processed using BIOTEX (Molecular Structure Corporation, Inc., Woodlands, Texas, USA). The AK:adenosine data were collected at room temperature with an Area Detector Systems Corporation (ADSC) multiwire area detector using a RIGAKU RU200 rotating anode X-ray generator, equipped with a graphite mono-

Conclusion
The high-resolution structures of the T. gondii apo adenosine kinase and its various complexes have revealed the stereochemical basis for the speci®c binding of adenosine and the more promiscuous phosphate donor substrate, ATP. Moreover, the structure of the AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP ternary complex, coupled with the structure of the apo enzyme, provides atomic-level insight into the novel phosphoryl transfer mechanism of this kinase, which requires an adenosine-induced hinge bending rotation of 30  , resulting in domain closure and ATP-induced helix folding and unfolding transitions. These changes are synergistic, since domain closure sequesters the adenosine and the ATP g phosphate from solvent and simultaneously delivers residue Arg136 from the small domain into the active site where its guanidinium group plays a key role in the activation and stabilization of the g phosphate during catalysis. ATP binding results in the unfolding of the N terminus of helix a11, which is required for the formation of the anion hole. The sequence conservation of the GG switch and novel anion hole heptad, DTXGAGD, the presence of Arg136 or equivalent basic residue, and the ubiquitous use of a sugar ring as a substrate indicates that all members of the ribokinase family will utilize similar, but not identical, cataly-

Data collected on the ACSD system were processed with the software provided by ACSD. The AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP and AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMPPCP data were obtained at room temperature on beam line 7-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation LaboraÊ tory using a MAR imaging plate and l  1.08 A. Data were processed with MOSFLM (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994). Structure determination and refinement of apo AK The structure of the T. gondii apo AK was solved by the method of molecular replacement (MR), using MERLOT (Fitzgerald, 1988) and human AK as the search model (Mathews et al., 1998). Initial attempts to solve the structure using the entire AK structure were unsuccessful. Therefore, the small and large domains were used in separate MR attempts. Although the small domain failed to give a solution, the large domain produced a reasonable solution to the rotation function, which was then used to determine the translation function. The resulting solution was veri®ed by EPMR, a genetic algorithmbased molecular replacement software package (Kissinger, et al., 1999). Using the large domain as a Ê Ê search model and data between 15.0 A and 4.0 A resolution, the EPMR solution resulted in a correlation coef®cient of 0.33. Examination of the crystal packing revealed an empty pocket for the missing small domain. Rigid body re®nement of the large domain resulted in an R-factor of 48.8 % (Tronrud et al., 1985). Replacement of the search model side-chains with the T. gondii sequence followed by positional (xyz) re®nement, using Ê Ê data from 10 A to 3.0 A, dropped the R-factor to 33.5 %. At this point, electron density was visible for pieces of the b strands that connect the large and small domains. These residues were built in as polyalanines, and xyz re®nement was carried out. The resulting electron density maps revealed clear features for the small domain. Consequently, the small domain of the human AK was rotated into the density as a rigid body and re®ned as a rigid body. After further xyz re®nement, the R-factor Ê Ê dropped to 28.4 % using data from 10 A to 3.0 A resolution. Model rebuilding was then initiated and was particularly needed at the many sites of insertions and deletions between the human and T. gondii enzymes. Two sites of deletions are the one-residue deletions between a2-b4 and a3-b5. A third deletion is found between b8-a5, which in the human enzyme includes an extra 310 helix. Moreover, the corresponding a5 in T. gondii is a turn shorter and in a different orientation. In the T. gondii AK there are two one-residue insertions between a5-b9 and a6-b10 and an 18-residue insertion between a10 and b12, which is disordered in all T. gondii AK crystal forms. Multiple cycles of positional and B-factor re®nement (xyzb) and model rebuilding resulted in a ®nal structure that contains residues 11 to 254 and 271 to 358 of the protein and 152 solvent molecules. The Rfactor and Rfree are 19.8 % and 28.7 %, respectively. Although weak electron density is observed for the very N and C-terminal residues, they were not included. Structure determination and refinement of the AK:adenosine complex The structure of the T. gondii AK:adenosine complex was solved by MR using the T. gondii apo AK structure as the search model. Several MR strategies, which used

565
the entire apo AK structure, were attempted but failed. Consequently, the structure was divided into its large and small domains, and a solution was obtained using Ê EPMR, the large domain and data between 15.0 A and Ê 4.0 A resolution. The correlation coef®cient was 0.37. After rigid body re®nement, the R-factor was 48.0 % and xyz re®nement dropped the R-factor to 33.1 %. At this point, clear density was observed for elements of the small domain, which were built in and re®ned via rigid body re®nement. Subsequent xyz re®nement dropped Ê Ê the R-factor to 25.7 % using data from 10.0 A to 3.0 A resolution. Cyclical rounds of extensive model rebuilding and xyzb re®nement dropped the R-factor to 13.0 % Ê Ê using data from 10.0 A and 2.55 A. The current model contains residues 11 to 254 and 271 to 358 of the protein, 162 solvent molecules, one chloride ion and one sulfate ion. The R-factor and Rfree are 13.0 % and 20.9 %, respectively.

Refinement of the AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP and the AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP complexes The structure of the AK:adenosine complex with the adenosine and solvent removed was used as the starting model for the AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP and AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP complex structures. Rigid body re®nement using the AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP data reduced the R-factor to 20.7 %. After several rounds of xyzb re®nement, the electron density was clear for the adenosine and AMP-PCP molecules. These molecules and eventually 217 solvent molecules were positioned in the electron density maps. Continued xyzb re®nement Ê dropped the R-factor to 18.1 % using data from 10.0 A to Ê 1.71 A resolution. A similar re®nement strategy was employed for the AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP complex. The electron density for the 7-iodotubercidin and AMP-PCP was remarkably clear (Figure 2). The current model of the AK:adenosine:AMP-PCP complex contains residues 11 to 254 and 271 to 358 of the protein, 212 solvent molecules, one chloride ion, one magnesium ion, one adenosine molecule and one molecule of AMP-PCP. The R-factor and Rfree are 17.8 % and 22.9 %, respectively. The current model of the AK:7-iodotubercidin:AMP-PCP complex contains residues 11 to 254 and 271 to 358 of the protein, 190 solvent molecules, one chloride ion, one magnesium ion, 7-iodotubercidin and one molecule of AMP-PCP. The R-factor and Rfree are 18.1 % and 23.9 %, respectively. The current models of the apo, adenosine-bound, adenosine:AMP-PCP-bound and 7-iodotubercidin:AMPPCP-bound structures display excellent stereochemistry, as determined by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), with at least 90 % of the residues of all structures falling in favorable region of the Ramachadran plot. There are two Ramachadran outliers in the apo structure (Arg83 and Asn190). In the AK-substrate complexes, the outliers are Arg83, Glu133 and Ser198, all of which exist in turns. Density for these residues is clear. Model building of all structures was carried out using FRODO (Jones, 1985) or O (Jones et al., 1991). Figures 1(b), (c) and 5 were generated with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991). Figures 1(d), and 6(b) and (c) were generated with GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). Figures 2 and 4 were generated with O (Jones et al., 1991). Figures 1(a), 3(a), (b) and 6(a) were generated with Sybyl6.2.
