Mutation of thymidylate synthase N229(177) to alanine results in an essentially inactive enzyme, yet it leads to formation of a stable ternary complex. The kinetics of N229(177)A show that kcat for Escherichia coli is reduced by 200-fold while the Km for dUMP is increased 200-fold and the Km for folate increased by tenfold versus the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structures of N229(177)A in complex with dUMP and CB3717, and in Ê Ê complex with dUMP alone are determined at 2.4 A, and 2.5 A resolution. These structures identify the covalently bound ternary complex and show how N229(177)A traps an intermediate, and so becomes inactive in a later step of the reaction. Since the smaller alanine side-chain at N229(177)A does not directly sterically impair binding of ligands, the structures implicate, and place quantitative limits on the involvement of the structured water network in the active site of thymidylate synthase in both catalysis and in determining the binding af®nity for dUMP (in contrast, the N229(177)V mutation in Lactobacillus casei has minimal effect on activity).

activity in Lactobacillus casei TS, showing that the amide side-chain is not directly involved in catalysis, yet when replaced with alanine reduces activity to essentially zero. However, the mutation N229(177)A leads to formation of a stable ternary complex with [6-3H]FdUMP and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate(CH2H4folate: Liu & Santi, 1993a), showing that it is prevented from completing a later stage in the reaction; raising the question of which perturbed locus in the binding site contributes to catalysis, and in which of the later steps in the reaction. One such locus could be a network of water molecules that is increasingly the focus of the chemistry of catalysis in TS. We therefore determined the kinetic properties of N229(177)A, and the crystal structure of an analog of the covalent reaction intermediate using the Escherichia coli enzyme. To separate effects due to the contribution to initial binding of dUMP, we determined the structure for the N229(177)AdUMP binary complex. The N229(177)A mutant of L. casei TS has been studied by crystallography, but in this case we were unable to cocrystallize the covalent reaction intermediate analog. A consistent

700 picture is achieved by comparison of the structures of the same mutant in the two species. Thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45) plays an essential role in the sole de novo biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), catalyzing the reductive methylation of the substrate dUMP using the cofactor CH2H4folate (Carreras & Santi, 1995; Stroud & Finer-Moore, 1993). N229(177), by providing the only two side-chain hydrogen bonds to the dUMP pyrimidine ring in the binding site (Finer-Moore et al., 1990; Montfort et al., 1990), contributes to, but is not requisite for the binding and catalytic turnover of dUMP (Liu & Santi, 1992, 1993a,b). N229(177) is a hydrogen bond donor from the NH2 to O-4 of dUMP, while the carboxamide oxygen atom serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the N-3 hydrogen atom of dUMP. It has been shown that the residue encodes speci®city for dUMP binding over other nucleotides. Speci®cally, a mutation of this residue to aspartic acid shifts substrate speci®city from dUMP to dCMP (Hardy & Nalivaika, 1992; Liu & Santi, 1992). A second mutation at H199(147)A, designed by structurebased protein engineering made a 1011-fold switch in selectivity toward dCMP (Agarwalla et al., 1997). Kinetics and crystallography of L. casei TS N229(177) mutants (Finer-Moore et al., 1998) show that hydrophobic side-chain substitutions interact unfavorably with the polar uracil heterocycle, decreasing binding af®nities by up to 100-fold. Mutations to smaller, hydrophilic sidechains alter the structure of the active-site cavity and the orientation of the ligands. These mutants show decreases in catalytic activity but show little change in the binding af®nities of substrate and cofactor. The N229(177)A mutation stands out as the most dramatic outlier in this series, in that it readily binds substrates to form a very stable ternary complex, yet shows no activity (Liu & Santi, 1993a). Therefore, the N229(177)A mutation serves to pinpoint the most important aspects in the evolutionary picture of what is important for catalysis. To further understand the contribution of N229(177) to the electrostatic environment of the TS active site and its role in ligand binding, we created, characterized kinetically, cocrystallized and determined the ternary{ complex of the TS mutant N229(177)A from E. coli with dUMP and CB3717, and binary complex of the N229(177)A mutant with dUMP alone. These structures and activities are compared to the corresponding wild-type equivalents. The results are found to be consistent between different species. Our results therefore support the concept that N229(177) plays a key role in coordinating a hydrogen bond network

Structure of a Mutant Thymidylate Synthase

between the ligands, active-site residues and ordered water molecules that indirectly, through water molecules, promotes catalysis by stabilization and proper orientation of reaction intermediates. The structure of E. coli N229(177)A cocrystallized with dUMP reveals that this activesite mutation leads to a rearrangement of the active site that sterically disallows the well-ordered binding of dUMP. In addition, the structure of N229(177)A in ternary complex with dUMP and CB3717 reveals a variation in the hydrogen-bond network between reactants, active-site residues and well-ordered water molecules. This network partially compensates for the loss of the asparagine side-chain with the positional rearrangement of hydrogen-bonding side-chains and the addition of ordered water molecules in the active site. The importance of the ground-state structure is emphasized, since N229(177)A has similarly impaired binding of the non-physiologic competitive inhibitor, pyridoxal 5H -phosphate (PLP). Analysis of high-resolution crystal structures of TS mutants from E. coli and L. casei combined with kinetics of TS mutants, together can de®ne the catalytic role of active-site amino acid residues. These studies help to de®ne the physical and chemical nature of the active site, allowing further design and improvement of anti-folates and substrate analogs that inhibit the TS reaction (Fauman et al., 1994; Finer-Moore et al., 1994; Hardy et al., 1987; Hyatt et al., 1997; Matthews et al., 1990a; Montfort et al., 1990; Perry et al., 1990; Sage et al., 1996; Schiffer et al., 1995).

Results
Kinetics for the TS reaction were determined. N229(177)A TS was cocrystallized as a binary complex with the substrate dUMP, and as a ternary complex with dUMP and CB3717, a quinazolinebased antifolate. These structures were determined Ê to resolutions of 2.5 A (dUMP, R-factor 14.7%, Rfree Ê 24.8%) and 2.4 A (dUMP and CB3717, R-factor 17.0%, Rfree 23.8%). Details of the structure determination and the re®nement are given in Table 1. These structures were compared with their wildtype counterparts to elucidate the outstanding loss of activity of the N229(177)A mutation. Effects of N229(177)A on kinetics Steady-state kinetic parameters of both wildtype and N229(177)A TS were determined (Table 2). The mutant TS has 200-fold reduced catalytic rate (kcat 0.04 sÀ1) compared to wild-type (kcat 8.8 sÀ1). The Km values for the wild-type and mutant TS are 20-fold increased from 4.1 mM (wild-type) to 88.6 mM (N229(177)A) for dUMP, and approximately tenfold increased from 13.6 mM (wild-type) to 102.7 mM (N229(177)A) for the cofactor. Attempts to determine an approximate Kd for dUMP by measuring inhibition of PLP binding (Santi et al., 1993) were unsuccessful because no

The N-1 of the quinazoline ring, which makes a hydrogen bond with Ê water 2, has moved 0.51 A away from A315(262). Density surrounding the CB3717 glutamate moiety is not contiguous with the rest of the ligand, implying multiple conformations for the glutamate residue, presumably due to the change in con®guration around the quinazoline ring (Figure 1). Comparison of N229(177)A ternary complex with wild-type ternary complex The two crystal structures superimpose with a Ê rmsd for Ca atoms in monomer 1 of 0.39 A Ê Ê (0.39 A monomer 2) and for all atoms of 0.48 A Ê monomer 2).

The average B-factor for monomer 1 of the wildÊ type structure is 17.9 A2 (23.7 A2 monomer 2), and Ê Ê for N229(177)A is 14.9 A2 (19.8 A2 monomer 2).

This map was calculated after C198(146), dUMP and CB3717 were omitted from the protein model, and the coordinates subjected to ten cycles of positional re®nement.

teins, whose differences would include components due to positioning in the lattice rather than thermal vibration of the molecules themselves, the active-site B-factors were normalized to the B-factors of the J-helix (residues 225(173) to 245(193)), a well-ordered component of the TS inner core, to develop an expression for the relative disorder of these residues; relative disorder  Bave(selected)/Bave(J-helix). The relative disorder is a normalized comparison of the thermal motion of the atoms in the active site (Perry et al., 1990). The normalized average B-factor for atoms Ê in the monomer 1 active site (Bave  13.0 A2 for Ê residues <12 A from O-4 of dUMP; relative disorder 1.08) reveals a 14% increase in the relative disorder of the mutant compared to the wild-type (relative disorder 0.93) active site. The active-site Ê ligand and cofactor of N229(177)A TS (29.9 A2 dUMP, relative disorder 2.49; 38.2 A2 CB3717, relative disorder 3.17) exhibit more apparent disorder compared to the ligand and cofactor of the wildÊ type enzyme (15.2 A2 dUMP, relative disorder Ê 1.11; 23.1 A2 CB3717, relative disorder 1.68). Movements of conserved residues and water molecules in the active site Calculation of an unbiased difference electron density map illuminates the differences between

two homologous structures (Chambers & Stroud, 1977). Diffraction data from the N229(177)A ternary complex were scaled to diffraction data from the wild-type ternary complex and an Fo(mutant) À Fo(wild-type) difference electron density map was determined with phases calculated from the wild-type TS model using the program XPLOR (Brunger, 1992). Analysis of the map reveals two important observations. First, negative difference electron density contoured at À3s (Figure 3) surrounds the wild-type N229(177) side-chain position, highlighting the deletion of the N229(177) amide side-chain group in the new structure. Second, the difference map shows negative difference density around the H199(147) wild-type position. Positive difference electron density contoured at a level of 3s indicates a shift in the position of the H199(147) side-chain toward the N229(177) wild-type position. The absence of the N229(177) amide side-chain causes a rearrangement within the active site. The most profound movement is made by the H199(147) side-chain, which shifts towards the space previously occupied by the wild-type N229(177) side-chain. The H199(147) imidazole group rotates 183 about the w2 bond and Ne2 Ê translates 2.15 A to move within hydrogen-bonding distance of the O-4 of dUMP. The carboxyl oxygen atoms of conserved E60(58) move out of

Major differences occur in the position of water molecules whose locations are strongly conserved in several other TS structures (Figure 4(a)). Water 1 Ê has shifted 0.99 A away from the dUMP and towards the wild-type position of H199(147). Water 7(water C7) and water 4(water 177a) are translated into the active site (towards the O-4 of Ê Ê dUMP), by 1.06 A and 1.32 A, respectively. Water 6(water 180) has shifted away from E60(58) by Ê 0.42 A and water 5(water 177) is not observed in the N229(177)A ternary structure.

Figure 4(a) illustrates the implicit wild-type hydrogen-bond network that positions dUMP for catalysis. In the wild-type hydrogenbond network, previously elucidated by this laboratory, N229(177) provides the only side-chain that directly hydrogen bonds to the pyrimidine ring of the substrate, forming a contact with NH-3 and O-4 of the dUMP (Finer-Moore et al., 1990; Montfort et al., 1990).

However, with the deletion of the N229(177) amide side-chain in the mutant structure, the electrophilic Ne2 of H199(147) is now Ê 2.72 A from O-4 of the dUMP, suggesting that the H199(147) Ne2 has replaced the Nd2 of N229(177) in a direct hydrogen bond to dUMP. Conserved water 1 is postulated to be important in stabilizing the enolate anion during the TS reaction (Figure 4(a)) and forms hydrogen bonds with O-4 of dUMP, Ne2 of H199(147), and with the carboxyl group of E60(58) in the wild-type structure. In the mutant N229(177)A structure (Figures 4(b) and 5), Ê water 1 is shifted 0.99 A away from O-4 of dUMP, but maintains a hydrogen bond with Oe1 of Ê E60(58) (3.15 A) and with Ne2 of H199(147) Ê (2.92 A) (Table 3).

This water molÊ ecule is located 2.89 A from the OH group of Ê Y233(181) and 3.05 A from water 1. A second new water molecule, water B, forms a new bridging hydrogen-bonding contact between Ne2 of Q217(165) and O-2 of dUMP. A third new water molecule, water C, coordinates a hydrogen-bond bridge with Y146(94) and O-4 of dUMP. In the wild-type structure, E60(58) coordinates three highly ordered water molecules in the hydrogen-bond network, 1, 5 and 6. Water 5 forms a hydrogen-bond bridge between E60(58) and N229(177). In the mutant structure, A229(177) is not able to support the hydrogen bond between water 5 and E60(58); water 5 has either been displaced or is too disordered to resolve by crystallography. E60(58) continues to coordinate water 6 with S232(180) at a distance of 2.90 A. Water 1 is also within hydrogen-bonding distance of water 4 Ê (2.81 A). N229(177)A ±dUMP binary complex isolates effects on dUMP, showing even less restrained binding N229A comparison to the wild-type binary E. coli TS structure The binary N229(177)A ± dUMP structure is consistent with weaker dUMP binding by the

mutant, as evidenced by the absence of ordered electron density of dUMP in the active site in spite of using a 50-fold molar excess of dUMP in the cocrystallization experiment, as well as being 100 Â Km. The lack of interpretable density parallels the 20-fold increase in Km for dUMP in the reaction kinetics of N229(177)a (Table 2). The conformation of the N229(177)A TS structure is consistent with the ``open'' conformation characteristic of the binary dUMP, or the unliganded form of TS. Direct comparison to the wild-type binary E. coli structure (Stout et al., 1998) shows a Ê rmsd for Ca atoms of 0.22 A and for all mainÊ chain atoms of 0.23 A.

Steric exclusion of dUMP by movement of conserved residues The movement of amino acid side-chains and the addition of new water molecules to the active site of the binary N229(177)A structure are similar to those seen in the N229(177)A ternary complex structure. The H199(147) side-chain again shifts towards the N229(177) position, bringing it within close proximity of O-4 of dUMP in the wild-type

structure. A new water molecule, water A, occupies the wild-type position of the histidine side-chain. However, in the N229(177)A binary structure, the H199(147) side-chain is shifted to Ê within 2.16 A of the binary wild-type position of Ê O-4 of dUMP. This is 0.39 A farther than H199(147) in the ternary structure and forces an overlap of the van der Waals radii of the sidechain with that of the wild-type dUMP position, which results in the dUMP being sterically

excluded from the active site (Figure 6). In the ternary complex, the energetic contributions of CB3717 binding presumably help to press dUMP farther into the active site. Side-chain positions of E60(58), W82(80), Y146(94) and Q217(165) approximate movements out of the active site similar to those seen in the N229(177)A ternary structure. Three active-site water molecules seen in the binary wildtype structure have shifted into the active site cavÊ ity by approximately 1 A in the ternary structure.

707 and the cofactor analog CB3717 (ternary). To complement our structural study, we have biochemically characterized the TS mutant N229(177)A. Both mutant crystal structures are isomorphous with wild-type enzyme structures, and high-quality data sets were collected (Table 1: and see Montfort et al., 1990; Perry et al., 1990). N229(177)A TS is a poorly functioning enzyme Residue 229(177) has been the subject of several mutagenesis studies, because it is the critical residue in assigning dUMP speci®city to TS (Hardy & Nalivaika, 1992; Liu & Santi, 1992, 1993a,b). Liu & Santi (1993a) completed a thorough study of mutations at position N229 of L. casei TS, and found that the main role of N229(177) was in determining the speci®city of the enzyme for dUMP. Recently, we exploited this role to effect a double mutant change in TS by structure-based engineering (Agarwalla et al., 1997) to effect a 1011-fold switch in speci®city, resulting in a novel dCMP methylase from TS with effectively the same activity for dCMP as TS has for dUMP. Hardy et al. (1994) engineered a TS with altered speci®city by making the N229(177)D mutant. Analysis of the enzymatic properties of N229(177)A as compared to wild-type E. coli TS are similar to results with another species, L. casei TS, showing that they are representative of the common active components of TS. The kcat for the E. coli mutant was dramatically reduced compared to the wild-type; although higher compared to the L. casei N229A mutant. This higher kcat correlates with poorer binding of dUMP and is consistent with the kcat/Km of L. casei N229A compared to the kcat/Km for other N229 mutants (Finer-Moore et al., 1998). However, the activity of E. coli N229(177)A TS relative to wild-type TS is tenfold greater compared to the corresponding L. casei mutant. This allowed us to measure Km for dUMP and mTHF, which were increased by 20-fold and tenfold relative to wild-type, respectively (Table 2). Although Km for dUMP could not be measured for L. casei TS N229(177)A, Kd for this mutant was only fourfold higher than for wild-type TS. Thus, af®nity for dUMP is signi®cantly impaired only for the E. coli mutant. The determination of the crystal structures of N229(177)A as both binary and ternary complexes provides a molecular explanation for these biochemical observations. Mutation of N229(177)A causes only local changes in the protein structures As expected, both the binary and ternary complexes of N229(177)A show perturbations of structure only in the regions close to the mutated residue. Overall, both structures are nearly superimposable with the corresponding wild-type strucÊ ture. The average rmsd for all atoms is 0.47 A Ê on Ca atoms) for the ternary complex, and (0.39 A Ê Ê 0.68 A (0.22 A on Ca atoms) for the binary complex

Figure 6. The van der Waals surfaces of H199(147) and dUMP. In the N229(177)A binary structure (above), dUMP is sterically excluded by the overlap of the van der Wals radii. This Figure was produced using the program INSIGHT II (Biosym Technologies).

A second, newly ordered molecule, water D, is Ê positioned 1 A into the active-site cavity from the wild-type position of O-2 of dUMP, and a free phosphate group occupies the position of the phosphate group of dUMP in the wild-type structure. Therefore, the absence of the only dUMP-binding side-chain, N229(177) in N229(177)A, results in steric exclusion of dUMP from the active site by movement of conserved active-site residues that accommodate the change in hydrogen bonding and reorganization of water. Since N229(177)A is so different from other alterations at N229(177), the effects cannot simply be attributed to the loss of hydrogen bonds to dUMP. They point to the importance of other effects that compensate for the mutation. These effects are quite local, and do not represent any large global switch in structure. Therefore, our results demonstrate that within a constrained active-site cavity, large as it is in TS, the requirements for compatible binding of the substrate and enzyme side-chain are completely dependent on the speci®cs of water organization.

Discussion
To investigate the role of N229(177) in determining TS dUMP binding speci®city, as well as its role in the TS reaction, we generated and analyzed X-ray crystalographic structures of puri®ed N229(177)A protein in putative complex with dUMP alone (binary) and in complex with dUMP

708 (Table 4). The average temperature factors compared to the wild-type structures are also similar (Table 5). However, close examination of the changes near the mutated residue provides a clear molecular explanation for why the N229(177)A mutant does not function as well as the wild-type protein, and provides a unique view of how water mediates plasticity in the binding of ligands to TS. The binary complex of N229(177)A reduces constraint on the uridine ring In the wild-type binary structure, dUMP is able to bind in the absence of cofactor in an orientation similar to that of the ternary complex, where it forms hydrogen bonds to the side-chain of N229(177)A (Stout et al., 1998). The hydrogen bonds between N229(177)A and dUMP O-4 and N-3 are important for dUMP orientation, but do not contribute signi®cantly to dUMP binding af®nity (Finer-Moore et al., 1998; Liu & Santi, 1993b). However, in our attempt to cocrystallize N229(177)A TS with a 50-fold molar excess of dUMP in a binary complex, we saw no ordered density for dUMP, con®rming the measured Km of the mutated protein for dUMP. Superimposition of the wild-type binary structure position of dUMP into the mutant active site reveals, in addition to the loss of two hydrogen bonds to the N229(177) side-chain, an unfavorable van der Waals interaction between H199(147) and dUMP that prevents the binding of the ligand (Figure 6). Mutation of N229(177)A to small, non-hydrogen-bonding sidechains in L. casei TS has shown that the hydrogen bonds contribute little to dUMP binding af®nity (Liu & Santi, 1993b). This steric hindrance emphasizes the contribution of the hydrophobic face of the cofactor to the stabilization of the proper orientation of dUMP. In the ternary complex, the cofactor sandwiches dUMP towards the wild-type position of H199(147) and therefore allows for the formation of a stable ternary complex. Without the cofactor, the dUMP is not able to force the sidechain of H199(147) back towards its wild-type position and therefore binds 20-fold less tightly. It is interesting to note that the binding of PLP (a nonphysiological ligand used to extract Kd values) also is inhibited in N229(177)A, validating the observed structural and hydrogen-bond rearrangements. The ternary complex of N229(177)A illustrates a perturbed but partially functional active site The optimal function of TS requires the maintenance of a concerted water-mediated hydrogenbond network in which N229(177) is a crucial component. In L. casei TS, mutation of any of the three residues participating in this network, N229(177), H199(147) or E60(58), is detrimental to catalysis, although none of the three residues is essential for activity (Huang & Santi, 1997). Mutation of N229(177) to A229(177) eliminates the side-chain of N229(177), and causes reorientation of H199(147)

and rearrangement of the water molecules in the network. It is therefore not surprising that the mutation negatively affects TS activity. What is surprising, however, is how the mutant TS recovers activity. Loss of the amide side-chain of N229(177) causes two dramatic changes in the TS active site. First, the imidazole ring of H199(147) swings over 183 to partially occupy the space left by removal of the amine group and recreates a connection with O-4 of dUMP. Second, a new molecule (water B) occupies the cavity and makes a connection with N-3 of dUMP. These recreated connections are not optimal, however, and the new water molecule may actually compete for part of the dUMP-binding site, partially explaining the large increase in Km for dUMP. This illustrates the need for exactness in compatibility of catalytic sites to their ligands. The hydrogen bonds between Q60(58), water 1 and O-4 of dUMP in wild-type TS are not conserved in the N229(177)A ternary complex. Instead, O-4 of dUMP compensates with a connection to water C, which is further coordinated with Y146(94) (Figures 4 and 5). Water 1 has been proposed to serve as a general acid in various steps in the enzymatic reaction, either alone or in concert with Q60(58) (Carreras & Santi, 1995; Matthews et al., 1990b; Sage et al., 1996). The structure of the N229(177)A ternary complex shows that, as with the conserved residues in the hydrogen-bond network, water 1 may contribute to, but is not required for catalysis. The L. casei TS variant N229A readily forms a covalent ternary complex with the dUMP analog 5-¯uoro-dUMP and the cofactor CH2H4folate, yet is completely inactive, suggesting that the mutation affects catalytic steps after formation of the covalent ternary complex intermediate (Liu & Santi, 1993a). The rearrangements in the water and active-site residues seen in the E. coli N229(177)A complex with dUMP and CB3717, an analog of the covalent complex intermediate, are similar to the rearrangements seen in L. casei N229A (FinerMoore et al., 1998). These congruous structural effects of the N229A substitution may account for the decreases in kcat observed for both species. Both Q60(58) and Y146(94) have been implicated in catalytic steps leading to breakdown of the ternary complex intermediate; namely, abstraction of dUMP C5-H from the ternary complex and subsequent elimination of tetrahydrofolate (Hardy et al., 1995; Huang & Santi, 1994; Hyatt et al., 1997). The altered hydrogen bonds to Q60(58) and Y146(94) resulting from rearranged water (Figures 4 and 5), especially elimination of the watermediated connection between Q60(58) and O-4 of dUMP, may interfere with the contributions of these residues to catalysis. Since we have not measured rates of formation of E. coli N229(177)A ternary complexes, we cannot rule out the possibility that the E. coli TS mutation lowers kcat primarily through slowing the binding and alignment of ligands. This seems less likely

709 the active site that might function as a safeguard for protecting critical enzyme function through evolution. Taking advantage of this by further manipulation of other active-site residues can create a novel TS architecture. Obvious secondshell residues to change include Y146(94) and Q217(165). A double mutation has already yielded a methylase of quite different function by design (Agarwalla et al., 1997). Generation of a novel TS whose catalytic engine was created by design would lend credence to the idea of engineering enzymes to perform speci®c catalytic functions. Enzyme design adds the dimensions of orientation and electrostatic substitution to the ®eld of protein design.

though, since L. casei TS variants of N229 associated with higher Kdump and more disordered m binary complexes, such as E. coli N229(177)A reported here, generally had higher kcat values, while the least active mutants had well-ordered but misoriented substrates (Finer-Moore et al., 1998). Mutations in a conserved active site do not imply conserved changes in Kd or structure The structure of L. casei N299(177)A-dUMPCB3717 has been determined by diffusing CB3717 into TS-dUMP crystals (we have not been able to make L. casei TS ternary complex cocrystals). When CB3717 is added directly to the crystals, the enzyme does not undergo the dramatic conformational change that usually accompanies folate binding, in which the active-site cavity closes around the ligands. Ligands in these complexes are bound similarly to ligands in ternary complex crystals, but are less well oriented and no covalent bond forms between dUMP C-6 and Cys198(146). These complexes are poorer analogs of the covalent reaction intermediate than the E. coli ternary complexes we are able to cocrystallize. Nevertheless, comparison of the L. casei and E. coli TS N299(177)A ternary complexes reveals common structural rearrangements responsible for the dramatic decrease in kcat in these mutants. Both show a shift of His199(147) into the space made by mutation of Asn229(177). In both species, His199(147) hydrogen bonds directly to dUMP, and the water-mediated hydrogen bond to Glu60(58) is disrupted. However, accommodations to mutation of N229(177) are different in E. coli and L. casei TS, and these can be associated with 100-fold changes in the Kd of dUMP, since they involve small shifts in non-conserved regions outside the active site, and water rearrangements that are different for each species. Water B, which appears to interfere with dUMP binding in E. coli N229(177)A, is absent in L. casei N229(177)A, and the H199(147) imidazole does not shift as far to accommodate the missing N229(177) side-chain in L. casei TS as in E. coli TS. In L. casei N229(177)A, the dUMP pyrimidine ring is shifted into the space occupied by water B and is well ordered in both binary and ternary complex structures. Therefore, in this mutant of TS second shell differences, that is, differences in residues that do not directly contact the ligands, evoke quite profound differences in the Kd values for ligands. This has a direct corollary in the evolution of antibody-binding mediated by second-shell mutations (Ulrich, 1997). Proposal: recreate wild-type TS activity from a new set of active-site residues The observation that the mutation to N229(177)A causes a rearrangement of the active site and that the conserved hydrogen-bond network is partially recreated, suggests plasticity in

Conclusion
The structures of ten binary and ternary complexes of six N229(177) mutants have now been determined in the two species E. coli and L. casei. N229(177)A is among the least active of the L. casei N229(177) mutants, showing no measurable activity, yet L. casei N229(177)A forms a stable ternary complex with FdUMP and CH2H4folate, suggesting that the mutant can readily undergo the ®rst steps in the TS reaction. Structures of ternary complexes of E. coli and L. casei N229(177)A implicate the water 1-mediated hydrogen bond between O-4 of dUMP and Glu60(58) in catalytic steps following formation of the covalent reaction intermediate. The structure and kinetics of the E. coli TS N229(177)A ternary complex we report here show that water can substitute for substratebinding side-chains, and that side-chains can substitute for binding and catalytic water.

Materials and Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis An asparagine to alanine point mutation at position 229(177) of E. coli TS was created by the method of Kunkel et al. (1987) using the synthetic DNA oligonucleotide 5H -GTGGCAATCGCGAACGGC-3H in the ThyA gene (Belfort et al., 1983) that had been cloned into Bluescript (Stratagene). Con®rmation of the sequence made by mutagenesis was con®rmed by DNA sequence analysis of both strands. Purification of thymidylate synthase N229(177)A TS was prepared as described (Sage et al., 1996) using the Maley & Maley (1988) method. Enzymatic activity assays of TS The enzymatic activity of N229(177)A TS was assayed by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm for the formation of H2-folate (Wahba & Friedkin, 1961). Assays were performed at 25 C in 0.1 M TES buffer (N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.4), 0.5 mM MgCl2. Km for dUMP was determined by measuring the initial reaction, holding mTHF at a constant concentration of 250 mM while varying

710
dUMP from 50 mM (2.0 mM wild-type) to 500 mM (20 mM wild-type). Km for mTHF was determined by holding dUMP at a ®xed concentration of 500 mM and varying mTHF from 50 mM to 500 mM. Km and kcat were determined graphically from an Eadie-Hofstee plot of v versus v/[s] (Eadie, 1942; Hofstee, 1959).

Structure of a Mutant Thymidylate Synthase re®nement using the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) gave an initial R-factor of 37.3%. Ligands and water molecules were located from Fo À Fc difference maps (Chambers & Stroud, 1977) during successive rounds of simulated annealing, positional and B-factor re®nement in X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) followed by manual inspection of electron density maps using the program CHAIN (Sack, 1988). The criteria for water addition were difference density greater than 3s in Fo À Fc maps and within Ê 3.5 A of a hydrogen-bond mate. The ®nal R-factor is Ê 17.0% to 2.4 A and Rfree is 23.8%. The wild-type E. coli TS binary complex (Stout et al., 1998) with water molecules and ligand removed was used as the molecular replacement search model for the N229(177)A binary structure. Rigid-body re®nement gave an initial R-factor of 23.8%. Water molecules in the structure were determined with the same criteria for addition as above. An Fo À Fc omit map of the active site contoured at 3.0 s revealed the absence of the ligand dUMP but the presence of a free phosphate group. The addition of water molecules and the phosphate group was followed by a re®nement procedure similar to that used for the ternary Ê structure. The ®nal R-factor is 14.7% to 2.5 A and Rfree is 24.8%. Structure comparisons Differences between the N229(1277)A TS and wildtype ternary structures (PDB entry 1KCE) were determined using the program GEM (Fauman et al., 1994). Average B-factors and distances were generated from N229(177)A and wild-type TS monomers. Root-mean squared deviations were calculated by superimposing monomer 1 from N229(177)A TS onto wild-type monomer 1 then computing the root-mean-squared average of the vector differences over the selected atoms. Accession codes The coordinates and structure factors for the N229(177)A ternary and binary structures have been submitted to the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank with the following entry codes: ternary N229(177)A, 1BQ1 (1BQ1SF for structure factors); binary N229(177)A, 1BQ2 (1BQ2SF for structure factors).

Crystallization For crystallization, puri®ed N229(177)A TS was dialyzed against 20 mM KPO4 (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. Hanging drop cocrystallization with dUMP and CB3717 grew ternary complex crystals of N177(229)A TS. A 6.0 ml drop of protein solution (20 mM K2PO4 (pH 80), 30 mg/ml TS N229(177)A, 15 mM dUMP, 10 mM CB3717, 100 mM MgCl2, 100 mm DTT, 2.2 ±2.26 m (NH4)2SO4) was equilibrated at room temperature against an excess of precipitant solution (2.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 20 mM KPO4, pH 7.4). Two data sets were collected from separate hexagonal rod crystals (150 mm Â 150 mm Â 450 mm) that grew over a two-week period. Binary complex crystals of N177(229)A TS cocrystallized with dUMP were grown in hanging drops as described (Stout et al., 1998) with a protein solution at pH 7.2 resulting in a cubic crystal form (200 mm Â 200 mm Â 200 mm) from which single crystal data were collected.

Data collection X-ray diffraction data were collected on an R-Axis IIc imaging plate with a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator operating at 15 kW (50 mA and 300 kV) Ê ®tted with a Cu anode (l 1.5418 A). The crystal-todetector distance was 100 mm. Exposures of 20 minutes per 1 oscillation range were used throughout the data collection, and 68 of data were recorded. The difÊ fraction data for the ternary complex to 2.4 A resolution were indexed, integrated, scaled and merged in the hexagonal space group P63 with unit cell Ê Ê dimensions a  b  127.05 A, c  68.00 A, a  b  90 and g  120 using the HKL software package (Otwinowski, 1990). For the N229(177)A ternary crystals, 160,471 observations were integrated, scaled and merged, yielding 24,557 unique re¯ections between 50 Ê and 2.4 A (Rmerge(I)  8.8% with average redundancy of 6.5). Ê Diffraction data to 2.5 A resolution for the binary complex were indexed, integrated, scaled and merged in the cubic space group I213 with unit cell dimensions Ê a  b  c  132.90 A and a  b  g  90 . In all, 82,403 observations were integrated, scaled and merged, yieldÊ ing 10,903 unique re¯ections between 50 and 2.5 A (Rmerge(I)  8.5% with average redundancy of 7.6).
