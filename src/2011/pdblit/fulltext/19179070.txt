Erythroid differentiation of human erythroleukemia cell line K562 induced by erythropoietin is a complex process that involves modifications at nuclear level, including nuclear translocation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In this work we show that erythropoietin stimulation of K562 cells can induce nuclear translocation of active Akt, a downstream molecule of the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. Akt shows a peak of activity in whole cell homogenates at earlier stage when compared to the nucleus, which shows a peak delayed of 10 min. Akt increases its intranuclear amount and activity rapidly and transiently in response to EPO. Almost all Akt kinase that translocates to the nucleus shows a marked phosphorylation on serine 473. Nuclear enzyme translocation is blocked by the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase inhibitor Ly294002 or Wortmannin. The specific Akt pharmacological inhibitor VI, VII and VIII that act as blocking enzyme activation inhibited translocation as well, whereas Akt inhibitor IX, that inhibits Akt activity, did not block Akt nuclear translocation. When cells were treated by means of siRNA sequences or with the Akt inhibitors the differentiation process was arrested, thus showing the requirement of the nuclear translocation of the active enzyme to differentiate. These findings strongly suggest that the intranuclear translocation of active Akt kinase represents an important step in the signaling pathway that mediates erythropoietin-induced erythroid differentiation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling network is crucial to widely divergent physiological processes that include cell cycle progression, differentiation, transcription, translation and apoptosis (Brazil et al., 2004). Membrane localization of PI3K by growth factors stimulates the generation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 ), activating a number of important downstream substrates (Hanada et al., 2004). The serine/threonine kinase Akt is a well-characterized downstream target of PI3K. In unstimulated cells, Akt resides within the cytoplasm in an inactive state, but binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain recruits inactive Akt to the plasma mem-

brane. To complete Akt activation, a first phosphorylation within its catalytic loop at threonine 308 by phosphoinositide-dependent protein-kinase 1 (PDK1) and a second phosphorylation, commonly believed to represent full activation of Akt, on serine 473 in its C-terminally hydrophobic motif by a kinase not yet conclusively identified are needed (Williams et al., 2000; Sarbassov et al., 2005). Activated Akt phosphorylates and modulates the activity of many proteins in cell growth, survival and apoptosis, including BAD and Caspase 9, apoptosis signal regulated kinase 1 (Ask1), FoxO family transcription factors, glycogen synthetase kinase 3 , and inhibitor kinase B (IkB) kinase (IKK) function (Chang et al., 2003; Steelman et al., 2004; Hennessy et al., 2005). Akt is involved in differentiation by activating nuclear transcription factors such as the forkhead transcription factor FKHR essential for differentiation and survival of hematopoietic and neuronal cells (Gotz et al., 2005). Binding of Erythropoietin (EPO) to its receptor (EPO-R), essential for erythroid cell proliferation and differentiation (Bunn, 2007), triggers the phosphorylation and activation of EPO-R bound JAK2 tyrosine kinase, resulting in activation of several downstream signaling pathways that include PI3K/Akt pathway, MAP kinase, STAT5

and protein kinase C (Jelkmann, 2007). Several studies suggest that the PI3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway may have an important role in supporting erythropoiesis (Klingmuller et al., 1997; Huddleston et al., 2003; Hammerman et al., 2005) and AKT is rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to EPO (Kashii et al., 2000; Bouscary et al., 2003). EPO scarcely stimulates K562 human erythroleukemia cell proliferation, but induces erythroid differentiation (Kitanaka et al., 1994). Suppression of PI3K activity by the fungal metabolite Wortmannin reduces the expression of erythroid differentiation in K562 cells (Kubota et al., 1996) and antisense src RNA expression interferes with hemoglobin synthesis, lying src immediately upstream of PI3K in the signal transduction of erythroid differentiation induced by EPO (Kubota et al., 2001). We have previously demonstrated that, in addition to its wellestablished role at the plasma membrane, PI3K translocates to the nucleus in response to EPO exposure of K562 cells, with increased PI3K activity and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production that occurs early after treatment at the nuclear level (Neri et al., 2002a,b). Indeed evidence collected from other leukemic cell types points to a key role played by PI3K (Marchisio et al., 1998; Neri et al., 1999a) and by Akt (Matkovic et al., 2006) in the transduction of differentiating signals from cell periphery to the nucleus. Since we observed that PI3K plays a role in erythroid differentiation at the nuclear level, we felt that K562 could constitute a useful model to investigate the relevance of the PI3K downstream molecule Akt in erythroid differentiation induced by EPO. Here we show that PI3K activation is a prerequisite for the nuclear translocation of Akt, that Akt activation by phosphorylation is also critical for its nuclear translocation and that increased Akt activity rapidly occurs in the nucleus in response to the cytokine. These events appear to be essential for EPO-induced erythroid differentiation that is blocked by Akt down modulation or Akt inhibitors, indicating that nuclear Akt may play a crucial role triggering the signal transduction cascade necessary for EPO's erythroid differentiating signal from cell periphery to the nucleus. 2. Materials and methods

H2B was from Boehringer Mannheim and recH2B was from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). 2.2. Cell culture and hemoglobin detection K562 human erythroleukemia cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FCS. EPO stimulation was performed at 3 U/ml. LY294002 was used at 25 M and Wortmannin was used at 100 nM, the PI3K inhibitors were administered 1 h prior EPO stimulation, Akt inhibitor VI and VII were used at 50 M final concentration, VIII at 25 M and IX at 20 M; the Akt inhibitors were administered 12 h prior to EPO stimulation. The hemoglobin determination kit was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). For hemoglobin determination, the benzidine staining solution was freshly prepared as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The expression of the specific erythroid antigen CD71 on K562 cell surface was determined by direct immunofluorescent staining with FITC conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies against human CD71. Analysis was performed with FACScan from Becton Dickinson. FITC conjugated mouse IgG1 was used as negative control. 2.3. Preparation of cell and nuclear fractions This was accomplished as reported by Bertagnolo et al. (1997). 2.4. Western blotting analysis Proteins separated on 0.1% SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, stained by Ponceau S and saturated in TBS with 5% not-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween-20 (T) 1 h at room temperature (RT), then incubated 2 h in blocking buffer containing primary antibody 1:1000 dilutions. After 4 washes in TBS with 0.1% T, samples were incubated 45 min at RT with secondary antibody and washed as previously described. Bands were visualized by chemoluminescence method. Anti-actin antibody was used to ensure equal protein loading and anti -tubulin antibody to assess purity of the nuclear fraction. 2.5. Immunoprecipitation (IP)

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences targeting the human Akt1 gene (Gene accession number NM 001014431) were purchased from QIAGEN (QIAGEN S.p.A., Milan, Italy). Antibody to Akt was from Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ) and anti p308Thr Akt, anti p473Ser Akt, anti-phosphorylated Akt substrate (PAS) antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA). Immunoprecipitation matrix was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); the kit for protein concentration detection was from Pierce (Rockford, IL).

IP was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction using the IP matrix. 2.6. Akt kinase activity assay Total Akt IP were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM MnCl2 . The reaction was started by mixing 10 l IP, 100 M ATP, 100 Ci/ml [ -32 P] ATP or P-ATP, 4 g H2B and incubated 40 min at RT. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 M Tris pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% -mercapto-ethanol and samples were loaded in SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gel was dried and H2B phosphorylation was revealed by auto-radiography or Western blot. 2.7.

octane to retard fading; slides were observed using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope coupled with a Photometric Cool Snap CCD camera for image acquisition. 2.8. RNA interference assays Small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences targeting the human Akt1 gene (Gene accession number NM 001014431) were synthesized by QIAGEN (QIAGEN S.p.A., Milan, Italy). Four specific sequence were as follows: Hs Akt1 6 sense r(CCA GGA CCA UGA GAA GCU U)dTdT, antisense r(AAG CUU CUC AUG GUC CUG G)dTdT; Hs Akt1 5 sense r(UCA CAC CAC CUG ACC AAG A)dTdT, antisense r(UCU UGG UCA GGU GGU GUG A)dTdT; Ha Akt1 10 sense r(CGC UUG GUC CCG AGG CCA A)dTdT, antisense r(UUG GCC UCG GGA CCA AGC G)dTdG; Hs Akt1 11 sense r(CCA UGA GCG ACG UGG CUA U)dTdT, antisense r(AUA GCC ACG UCG CUC AUG G)dTdG. The lyophilized siRNA was dissolved in sterile Suspension Buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM Hepes-KOH, 2 mM magnesium acetate, pH 7.4) to obtain a 20 M solution. Then, oligonucleotides were heated to 90  C for 1 min followed by 1 h at 37  C. As a control, non-silencing fluorescein-labeled duplex siRNA, also purchased from QIAGEN, was used. Exponentially growing K562 cells were transfected in contemporary with 6 g of each siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocols. In brief, 1 day before transfection, cells were seeded without antibiotics at 106 cells/well in six-well tissue culture plate. The cells were transfected with siRNA and were incubated with siRNA plus Lipofectamine2000 in Opti-MEM I or in Opti-MEM I with Lipofectamine2000 (control cells). After 5 h, cells transfected with fluorescein-labeled siRNA were subjected to cytofluorimetric analysis to determine transfection efficiency that resulted higher than 60%. After 48 h from transfection cells were treated with EPO for 10 min and then cells were harvested for analysis. 3. Results 3.1. EPO determines subcellular redistribution of phosphorylated p473Ser Akt in K562 cells Since previous investigations have highlighted that p-Akt may migrate to the nucleus (reviewed in Neri et al., 2002b), we sought to analyze the subcellular distribution of Akt after its serine 473 residue phosphorylation in K562 erythroleukemia cells, that were induced to differentiate by 96 h of EPO treatment. As shown in Fig. 1, either with Benzidine staining or with flow cytometric analysis with anti CD71, after 4 days of treatment more than 50% of cells were differentiated.

Fig. 2. Akt expression and phosphorylation levels in K562 cells. Western blot on unstimulated K562 cells, cells exposed to EPO or cells exposed to EPO plus Ly294002 or Wortmannin. In each lane 20 g proteins were loaded, as confirmed by anti-actin antibody.

No changes of total Akt amount were found in all the examined times of EPO treatment. However, using the anti p473Ser Akt antibody, we found that Akt activation was evident already at 5 min, with a peak of Akt phosphorylation 10 min after EPO stimulation and decreased until 30 min, maintaining a phosphorylation level higher than the untreated control (Fig. 2). Pre-treatment of cells with 25 M Ly294002 or 100 nM Wortmannin alone did not modify Akt levels. Cells pre-treated with 25 M Ly294002 or 100 nM Wortmannin before EPO stimulation showed Akt expression and phosphorylation levels comparable, at each time point, to those of untreated cells. Western blotting performed on nuclei isolated from K562 EPOtreated cells showed increased amount of total nuclear Akt in a range from 10 to 20 min, with a peak at 15 min (Fig. 3A). The nuclear immunolabelling of p473Ser Akt started 10 min after treatment, increased to a maximum intensity 15 min after stimulation in parallel with total Akt nuclear translocation and after 30 min was slightly higher than the control sample. Cell number was not affected by pre-treatment with Ly294002 before EPO stimulation and no modifications of Akt distribution and phosphorylation state were observable. In Ly294002 or Wortmannin and EPO treated samples, Akt expression and phosphorylation levels were comparable to those of untreated cells. The human leukemia T-cell derived Jurkat cell line was used as positive control (Fukuda et al., 2005; Seminario et al., 2003). Immunocytochemical analysis showed total Akt mainly in the cytoplasm of untreated K562 cells. Nevertheless, nuclei, identified by means of phase-contrast microscopy (data not shown), showed also in control cells the presence of only a small amount of fluorescence (Fig. 3B). Immunostaining intensity increased in the nucleus after 15 min of EPO stimulation and greatly decreased, at the level of untreated cells, after 30 min of treatment. Cells pre-treatment with 25 M Ly294002 prevented the intranuclear Akt translocation. Immunostaining using anti p473Ser Akt antibody in control K562 cells showed fluorescence predominantly located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). After 15 min of EPO stimulation, immunofluorescence increased and concentrated inside the nuclear compartment to strongly decrease after 30 min. Pre-treatment with Ly294002 prevented the p473Ser Akt translocation into the nucleus after 15 min of EPO treatment (Fig. 3B). 3.2. Exposure of K562 cells to EPO increases Akt kinase activity in whole cell homogenates and in nuclei K562 cells treated with EPO exhibited an increase of total immunoprecipitable Akt activity levels in kinase assay performed

in vitro toward the exogenous substrate histone H2B. A rise of Akt activity was detected early after 5 min and peaked 10 min after EPO treatment in whole cell homogenates, to reduce, after 30 min, to levels still higher than the control. The dependence on the PI3K/Akt pathway was further assessed, when cells, pre-treated with 25 M Ly294002 or with 100 nM Wortmannin, even if stimulated with EPO did not show any increase in Akt activity (Fig. 4A). Akt immunoprecipitated from nuclei showed after 10 min an increased enzymatic activity, that reached a peak 15 min after EPO stimulation, was still high after 20 min and lasted even if at a lower intensity until 30 min. Cells pre-treated with 25 M Ly294002 or 100 nM Wortmannin exhibited Akt activity levels comparable to those of untreated cells (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained using anti-phosphorylated Akt substrate (PAS) antibody to reveal phosphorylation of recombinant histone H2B after in vitro Akt kinase assay. In whole cell homogenates the highest labeling was detectable after 10 min of EPO treatment (Fig. 4C) and in isolated nuclei an increase in phosphorylation of H2B PAS sites (i.e. serine/threonine phosphorylation) was observed maximal after 15 min of EPO administration (Fig. 4D). 3.3. The majority of nuclear Akt is phosphorylated on serine 473 residue after EPO stimulation To exclude that nuclear Akt activity could be simply a consequence of its translocation to the nucleus, the amount of phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated Akt in nuclei of K562 cells treated with 3 U/ml EPO was compared by performing double round immunoprecipitation from nuclear fractions. A first immunoprecipitation round was performed using anti p473Ser Akt antibody and revealed by Western blot using anti Akt. Increased p473Ser Akt in nuclei was observed after 15 min of EPO treatment (Fig. 5). A little amount of p473Ser Akt, appreciably more intense than control nuclei, was immunoprecipitable after 30 min of EPO administration. The second round of immunoprecipitation using anti Akt antibody was carried out on the supernatants derived from first

immunoprecipitation round. The remaining unphosphorylated Akt was revealed by anti Akt antibody. This analysis showed that unphosphorylated Akt was very faint or extremely low compared to p473Ser Akt level in both samples, thus showing that almost all nuclear Akt is phosphorylated on serine 473 residue (Fig. 5). 3.4. Different Akt inhibitors induce different levels of Akt phosphorylation on serine 473 residue In order to test whether the activation of nuclear Akt in EPO treated cells is required for differentiation to proceed or whether the increase is only a consequence of differentiation and to explore the relevance of this activation, we used a panel of Akt inhibitors interfering with the activation process (inhibitors VI, VII and VIII) or acting on its kinase activity after the activation (inhibitors IX). Inhibitor VI and VII interact with the PH domain, inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to Akt and consequently membrane translocation and activation of Akt (Hiromura et al., 2004). Inhibitor VIII was found to be cell active and to block phosphorylation of Akt at threonine 308 and serine 473 thus reducing the levels of active Akt in cells (Barnett et al., 2005). At variance, inhibitor IX selectively inhibits Akt kinase activity without blocking phosphorylation of Akt itself at either threonine 308 or serine 473 (Jin et al., 2004). Akt total amount was unchanged, independently from EPO or inhibitor treatments. When cells treated with EPO were pre-treated with inhibitors blocking Akt activation, no detectable raise in phosphorylation on serine 473 was observed. On the contrary, the inhibitor acting on the kinase activity of Akt did not modify the increase of phosphorylation level on the 473 serine residue (Fig. 6A). We used Akt inhibitor VIII or IX as representative inhibitors of the two different mechanisms of Akt inhibition to detect total and p473Ser Akt localization by immunofluorescence during EPO stimulation and inhibitors treatment. In control cells both total or p473Ser phosphorylated Akt are distributed throughout the cytoplasm and their distribution is not affected by inhibitors (Fig. 6B and C, images A and D control, B and E). Treatment with Akt inhibitor VII did not modify the distribution of Akt in both native and phosphorylated form after EPO exposure (Fig. 6B and C, image C). On the contrary, in Akt inhibitor IX-treated samples, 15 min of EPO administration triggered nuclear translocation of total or p473Ser phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 6B and C, image F). 3.5. The phosphorylation state of Akt determines its translocation to the nuclear compartment We performed subcellular fractionation experiments in order to determine whether or not Akt phosphorylation and activation could be related to its nuclear translocation. We first evaluated the activity of Akt kinase in the nuclear fractions of cells pretreated for 12 h with the different inhibitors followed by exposure to EPO. The increase of enzymatic activity induced by EPO after

(A) In the first row is shown Akt kinase activity into nuclei of K562 cells after pre-treatment with different Akt inhibitors and EPO stimulation. In the following rows total Akt, p308Thr Akt and p473Ser Akt into nuclei were also analyzed by Western blotting. Viability of the cells was always more than 90%; data are representative of three different experiments. (B) Upper panel: first round of IP carried out on nuclei of K562 cells with p473Ser Akt.

lated forms translocates to the nuclear interior (Fig. 7A). On the contrary, when cells were treated with inhibitor IX, EPO treatment triggered the nuclear translocation of Akt phosphorylated on threonine 308 residue and on serine 473 residue (Fig. 7A). It is worthy to note that cell viability in all cases was at least 90% (Fig. 7A). As described above (Fig. 4), we investigated the amount of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Akt in nuclei of K562, by a first immunoprecipitation round performed using anti p473Ser Akt antibody and a second round using anti Akt antibody was carried out on supernatant of first round of immunoprecipitated samples. In both rounds the product of immunoprecipitation was revealed by Western blot using anti Akt antibody. This analysis showed that the strong rise in p473Ser Akt labeling in nuclei from cells treated with EPO for 15 min, or with EPO and inhibitor IX, became extremely low after the second round of immunoprecipitation thus showing that, even if its enzymatic activity is inhibited, almost all nuclear Akt, capable to translocate to the nucleus, is in its phosphorylated and active form on serine 473 residue (Fig. 7B). On the contrary, the faint band observable in samples pre-treated with inhibitor VI, VII and VIII, remained substantially unchanged after the second immunoprecipitation (Fig. 7B). The use of Akt inhibitors suggests therefore an essential role of Akt activation for its nuclear translocation. 3.6. Effects of down modulation or Akt inhibition on erythroid differentiation To give new insights into functional consequences for a developmental role of active Akt translocation into the nucleus, we have down-modulated the expression of Akt during EPO treatment of K562 cells. By means of siRNA sequences, a reduced amount of Akt protein was obtained in control cells as well as in differentiating cells, in which Akt expression was forcedly silenced in the aim of counteracting the EPO induced nuclear translocation of Akt protein (Fig. 8A). As reported in Fig. 8B, the reduced expression of Akt results in a large decrease of the erythoid differentiation level. Similarly when

Fig. 8. Down-modulation of Akt expression or biochemical inhibition impairs erythroid differentiation. K562 erythroleukemia cells, subjected to RNA interference assay in control (-) or differentiating conditions for 4 days (+), were subjected to immunochemical analysis to evaluate Akt expression (A) and to cytofluorimetric determination to estimate their differentiation level (B). In K562 cells EPO induces hemoglobin synthesis, which was hampered by siRNA sequences or treatment with different Akt inhibitors. Values are percentage of CD71-positive cells. Viability was always more than 80% and S.D. less than 10%. The data are representative of three separate experiments performed in duplicate.

cells were pre-treated with specific Akt inhibitors the increase of EPO-induced hemoglobin synthesis in the cells was significantly suppressed and differentiation did not occur, thus indicating that nuclear Akt enzymatic activity plays a relevant role in K562 cells erythroid maturation. This set of data demonstrates that a reduced expression of Akt considerably impairs the differentiative potential of EPO and supports the contention that Akt is indispensable for the progression of tumoral erythroleukemia cells along the erythoid lineage. 4. Discussion In this paper we observed the role of Akt during the initial steps of the human erythroid differentiation and we have shown, for the first time to our knowledge, that EPO treatment activates Akt in K562 erythroleukemia cells and induces the translocation of Akt active form in the nuclear compartment in a rapid and transient manner, suggesting that Akt plays a crucial role in EPO mediated erythroid differentiation. This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence. In vivo Akt phosphorylation and in vitro Akt kinase activity were up-regulated by EPO administration to K562 cells. Both phosphorylation and activity of Akt were down-regulated by the pharmacological PI3K inhibitors, Ly294002 or Wortmannin, thus showing that Akt activation is in the PI3K/Akt signal transduction axis. We have previously demonstrated in K562 cells the nuclear translocation of PI3K and the increase in intranuclear in vivo synthesis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in response to EPO (Neri et al., 2002b). In the present study immunoprecipitable nuclear Akt activity showed an increase starting from 10 min that reached a maximum after 15­20 min. This enhancement was similar but delayed of 5­10 min when compared to Akt activation in whole cells and may be explained by the time required by Akt for translocating into this cell fraction, where almost all Akt results phosphorylated in the sites of activation. The nuclear peak of enzymatic activity delayed when compared with whole cells and the fact that at 5 min of stimulation nuclei did not show an increase in activity, demonstrate unlikely that the increase we measured in nuclear Akt activity was due to a cytoplasmic contamination. These events, which occur after 15 min of EPO stimulation, are accompanied by a rise of the enzymatic activity of this kinase into nuclei of K562 cells. The localization of p473Ser Akt mainly into the nucleus indicated that some putative Akt targets reside within this organelle. Known substrates are, for example the forkhead transcription factors, that link the PI3K/Akt cascade to gene expression that regulates cell growth, survival, and metabolism (Kops et al., 1999). Akt phosphorylates the nuclear receptors RAR alpha (retinoic acid receptor alpha) and inhibits its transactivation (Srinivas et al., 2006). It has recently been reported that acinus, a nuclear factor required for apoptotic chromatin condensation, is a direct target of Akt (Hu et al., 2005b) and zyxin, a focal adhesion molecule, is phosphorylated in the nucleus on serine 142 by Akt, leading to its association with acinus (Chan et al., 2007). Therefore, by regulating zyxin/acinus complex formation in the nucleus, Akt influences apoptosis. Although it is now clear that Akt migrates to the nucleus as the result of treatment with growth factors, the mechanism by which Akt translocates into the nucleus remains unclear. There are several reports indicating that Akt nuclear translocation may be attributable to an activation of PI3K. In human mature T-cell leukemia the mechanism of Akt nuclear translocation involves PI3K that has been suggested as a physiological regulator of Akt within the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (Pekarsky et al., 2000). In osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells exposed to proliferative growth factor, Akt nuclear translocation appears to be mediated by PI3K

(Borgatti et al., 2000). It has been shown before that nuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 facilitates translocation of proteins with PH domain. For example both nuclear PI3K and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are necessary for the nuclear translocation of PKC- (Neri et al., 1999b) or for PIKEL binding and residency into the nucleus that is compromised by mutations of its PH domain leading to a decreased activation of Akt (Hu et al., 2005a). More recently a report by Xuan Nguyen et al. (2006) showed that Akt phosphorylation is coupled to its nuclear translocation, which requires PI3K activity for the maintenance of Akt activation within the nucleus under conditions of NGF stimulation. Consistently with this report, we have found that there is a relevant p473 serine residue phosphorylation of Akt recovered in the nucleus, with only a very limited amount of protein not phosphorylated on serine residues and treatment of cells with Ly294002 fully inhibited EPO-stimulated Akt translocation to the nucleus. Thus Akt nuclear translocation may be attributable to an activation of PI3K. We demonstrated with a different biochemical method that Akt nuclear residence is regulated by its phosphorylation status, whereas its kinase activity appears to be not required. It is worthy to note that, when nuclear Akt kinase activity is inhibited in the nucleus either by activation plus translocation block and either by kinase activity inhibition, erythroid maturation is not taking place. Our siRNA down modulation data address the issue of whether the increase of the amount of nuclear Akt we have observed in erythoid differentiation is merely designed to the function of Akt in mature cells or, more intriguingly, it is functionally relevant to the maturation mechanism. Although the enhanced Akt activity is usually associated with the proliferative and survival signals also in leukemia cells, a growing body of evidences indicates a relevant role also in erythroid differentiation. Our data gain relevance when compared with data obtained in human erythroid progenitors. EPO induced maturation of human CD34+ erythroid progenitors is dependent on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Myklebust et al., 2002; Bouscary et al., 2003). In the context of EPO signaling it has been shown that Akt phosphorylates both GATA-1 and Foxo3a, transcription factors of crucial importance in erythropoiesis (Bouscary et al., 2003; Kadri et al., 2005). Enforced expression of Myr-Akt, a constitutively active form of Akt, highly augmented EPO-induced erythropoiesis and induced cell hypersensitivity to EPO in the earliest committed cells of the erythroid lineage, the erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E), human erythroid progenitors CD34+ CD71+ CD45RA¯ GPA¯ (Sivertsen et al., 2006). These effects were completely counteracted by the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002. Interestingly, Ghaffari et al. (2006) recently demonstrated that enforced expression of activated Akt in murine fetal liver progenitor cells overrode the need for EPO to induce erythroid differentiation. They concluded that the enhanced erythroid maturation of activated-Akt-transfected cells was not limited to its anti-apoptotic or proliferative effect as no increase in total cell number was observed. Increased activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may be particularly relevant to normal hematopoiesis and to patients with polycythemia vera (PV). These results are strengthened by the identification of molecules downstream to Akt that are relevant in human erythropoiesis. Akt has been described as a mediator of EPO modulation of GATA-1 transcription factor that may coordinate EPO-R signaling and GATA1 activities during hematopoietic cell differentiation (Zhao et al., 2006). K-ras has been identified as the major regulator for cytokine dependent Akt activation in erythroid differentiation in vivo (Zhang and Lodish, 2005). Taken together, these data indicate that Akt may play a major function during erythroid differentiation, by becoming active and translocating into the nucleus where it may activate several

substrates involving transcription factors responsible for cell maturation and advancement of the erythroid differentiation. In this latter event, as also demonstrated by down regulation by means of siRNA sequences, Akt could play an active role during EPO-driven differentiation of tumoral cells, thus constituting a molecular target for therapeutic intervention. Important step in this field will be the identification of the molecular events produced by Akt activation during erythroleukemia cells differentiation, among the multiple effects exerted by this multifunctional kinase into the nucleus. These findings may help identifying novel target into the nucleus essential for differentiation and thus useful for anticancer therapy of hematological malignancies.
