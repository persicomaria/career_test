Abstract The OxyR protein is a transcriptional activator for a subset of peroxide stress-inducible genes, most of which are involved in defense systems against oxidative stress. Recently, it was demonstrated that purified OxyR has one intramolecular disulfide bond, which led to the proposal that the reversible disulfide bond formation regulates the activity of OxyR as a transcription factor in response to peroxide stress. In this study, I demonstrated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions that an intramolecular disulfide bond is formed in OxyR upon exposure of the cells to hydrogen peroxide in vivo. Experiments using strains expressing mutant OxyR proteins with Cys to Ser single amino acid substitutions confirmed that the disulfide bond is formed between the Cys-199 and -208. Kinetic analyses indicated that the formation of the disulfide bond is rapid and transient, oxidized within 30 s and re-reduced within 5 min after the addition of hydrogen peroxide in the wild-type strain. These results provide evidence for the regulatory role of the reversible oxidation of dithiol to disulfide in sensing peroxide stress in vivo and signal transduction to the transcription apparatus by OxyR. z 1999 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Exposure of exponentially growing Escherichia coli cells to low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide activates the expression of at least 40 proteins, and makes the cells resistant to subsequent challenges with much higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide [1,2]. The oxyR gene is required for the induction of a subset of hydrogen peroxide-inducible genes [3], including katG (encoding catalase hydroperoxidase I), ahpC (alkylhydroperoxide reductase), gor (glutathione reductase) and grxA (glutaredoxin 1), which are directly involved in defense against oxidative stress [1^3]. In addition, some oxyRactivated genes function as regulators for gene expression, thereby controlling additional genes under oxidative stress conditions [4,5]. OxyR is a member of the LysR family of activators, and acts both as a sensor of peroxide stress and as a transcriptional activator for genes induced by the stress [6,7]. The inactive form of the OxyR protein present in unstressed cells is oxidized upon exposure to peroxide stress and converted to its active conformation as a transcriptional activator [8]. The activated form binds just upstream of the promoter 335 sequence of target genes, and stimulates transcription initiation by directly making contact with RNA polymerase [9,10]. The

molecular nature of the oxidative modi¢cation leading to OxyR activation had been considered to be oxidation of a Cys thiol to sulfenate or sul¢nate, because only Cys-199 among the six Cys residues was reported to be essential for sensing peroxide stress [8]. However, there has been no biochemical evidence directly demonstrating the presence of such oxidatively modi¢ed Cys residues in the active form of OxyR. Recently, Zheng et al. [11] demonstrated by mass spectrometric analysis that there is one intramolecular disul¢de bond in puri¢ed OxyR4C-A protein, an OxyR mutant in which four of the six Cys residues other than those at positions 199 and 208 were substituted with Ala. They also reported that the remaining two Cys residues are essential for transcriptional activation of the target genes upon exposure to peroxide stress. Furthermore, these two Cys residues are conserved among the OxyR homologues identi¢ed in other bacterial species. Based on these observations, they proposed that formation and reduction of the disul¢de bond between Cys-199 and -208 regulates the activity of OxyR as a transcriptional activator [11]. In this study, I examined the formation of the intramolecular disul¢de bond in the wild-type OxyR protein in vivo by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under non-reducing conditions, and found that the disul¢de bond identi¢ed in vitro is transiently formed in peroxide-stressed E. coli cells. The results indicate that the disul¢de bond formation in OxyR is relevant to the regulation of the OxyR activity as a transcriptional activator. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids and media E. coli K12 strain MC4100 was used as the wild-type strain. TA4112 is an oxyR deletion strain described previously [3]. pRS100 carries the promoterless oxyR gene from pKT823 [7] in the EcoRIHindIII site of pKK223-3 (Pharmacia LKB). pRS100 derivatives (pRS101^pRS106), each carrying a Cys to Ser mutation in OxyR, were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis [12]. Cells were aerobically grown in Luria-Bertani medium [13] at 37³C. 2.2. Determination of OxyR oxidation states by non-reducing SDS-PAGE To avoid arti¢cial reduction of oxidized proteins during sample preparation by cellular factors, proteins were rapidly denatured with trichloroacetic acid at various time intervals after the addition of hydrogen peroxide, and trapped in the oxidized form [14]. Brie£y, exponentially growing cultures of E. coli, with or without hydrogen peroxide treatment, were directly mixed with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid solution, and incubated for 1 h on ice. The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was precipitated by centrifugation, washed twice with cold acetone, and air-dried. The precipitates were solubilized in the sample bu¡er (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and 2% iodoacetamide), and incubated for 15 min at 25³C. Then samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (10% T, 3.3% C) as described previously [15], except that the separation gels contained 8 M urea. After electrophoresis, the

Fig. 1. Identi¢cation of disul¢de-bonded forms of OxyR by SDSPAGE under non-reducing conditions. Exponentially growing cells (MC4100) were exposed to (lanes 2 and 4) 100 WM of hydrogen peroxide for 1 min (lanes 1 and 3, not exposed). Proteins were rapidly denatured and precipitated by ice-cold tricholoroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and dissolved in SDS bu¡er containing iodoacetamide. They were then electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea, after (lanes 1 and 2) or without (lanes 3 and 4) dithiothreitol treatment (35 mM). OxyR was visualized by Western blot analysis. The reduced and oxidized forms of OxyR are indicated by arrowheads. proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene di£uoride membrane [16], and OxyR was visualized with anti-OxyR antiserum [17] and a chemiluminescence detection system.

A strain expressing the wild-type OxyR (TA4112 carrying pRS100) was grown to midlog phase, and then exposed to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for 1 min. Redox states of OxyR were examined as described in Fig. 1.

3. Results and discussions Proteins having intramolecular disul¢de bond(s) often migrate faster than their reduced forms on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, because of their more compact conformations in gels [18]. Based on this principle, I initially attempted to identify the oxidized form of OxyR in cells exposed to peroxide stress. When proteins were electrophoresed on a standard gel system [15] without any reducing treatment, no reproducible di¡erence in electrophoretic mobility was observed between OxyR exposed to oxidative stress and that not exposed to oxidative stress (data not shown). Therefore, I attempted to identify the oxidized form by using urea-containing separation gel instead of a standard gel. Inclusion of urea

An oxyR deletion strain (TA4112) was transformed with pRS100 (lanes 1 and 2), pRS101 (lanes 3 and 4), pRS102 (lanes 5 and 6), pRS103 (lanes 7 and 8), pRS104 (lanes 9 and 10), pRS105 (lanes 11 and 12) and pRS106 (lanes 13 and 14), and was examined for the formation of the disul¢de-bonded form of OxyR after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (100 WM) for 1 min as in Fig. 1. Electrophoresis was carried out under reducing (A) or non-reducing conditions (B). The oxidized and reduced forms of OxyR are indicated by arrowheads on the right. For the C208S mutant, an additional high molecular weight band is seen, as indicated by the small arrowhead.

in the separation gel might enhance the structural di¡erence between the reduced and disul¢de-bonded forms of proteins during electrophoresis by the denaturing e¡ect of urea, and would allow separation of the disul¢de-bonded form of OxyR. Fig. 1 shows the results of an immunoblotting after electrophoresis on urea-containing gel. OxyR from hydrogen peroxide-treated cells migrated distinctly faster than that from untreated cells on urea-containing gel under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). After reduction with dithiothreitol, they migrated identically (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, the faster-migrating band corresponds to the oxidized form of OxyR. Next, I examined the formation of the faster-migrating species of OxyR after hydrogen peroxide treatment in strains expressing mutant OxyR proteins, carrying Cys to Ser single amino acid substitutions. A series of plasmids expressing mutant OxyR proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, and transformed into an oxyR deletion strain (TA4112). In agreement with a previous report [11], two mutants, Cys-199 to Ser (C199S) and C208S, could not complement the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of the oxyR deletion strain (data not shown). Furthermore, they were totally defective in oxyR-dependent katG induction in response to peroxide stress as measured by the expression of the L-galactosidase activity encoded in the katGP-PlacZ fusion gene (data not shown). These observations con¢rm that the Cys residues at 199 and 208 are essential for peroxide stress sensing by OxyR. Using the same strains, I examined the formation of the faster-migrating form of OxyR after hydrogen peroxide treatment. Under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2B), the fastermigrating form of OxyR was observed in hydrogen peroxide-treated cells expressing the wild-type, and the C25S, C143S, C180S and C259S mutant OxyR proteins. In contrast, the faster-migrating form was not detected for the C199S and C208S mutants. In the C208S mutant, a slowly migrating band was detected in addition to the band corresponding to the reduced form (Fig. 2B, lane 12). This high molecular weight band may correspond to an OxyR dimer crosslinked between two Cys-199 residues observed in vitro [11]. Again, the wild-type and all the mutant OxyR proteins migrated identically under conditions where the samples were reduced with dithiothreitol before being subjected to electrophoresis

(Fig. 2A). Taken together, these results indicate that the faster-migrating species identi¢ed on urea-containing gels represents the disul¢de-bonded form of OxyR, and that an intramolecular disul¢de bond between Cys-199 and -208 is formed upon exposure of the cells to low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in vivo. The OxyR response is activated by micromolar levels of hydrogen peroxide in exponentially growing cells [19,20]. If the disul¢de bond formation is relevant to the activation of OxyR as a transcriptional activator, it should be formed upon exposure to a similar range of hydrogen peroxide concentrations. In addition, transcriptional activation of the OxyR regulon is rapid and transient. Upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide, transcription of an oxyR-regulated gene is induced within 1 min, and the maximum accumulation of transcripts is observed between 2.5 and 5 min [4]. Pulse-labeling experiments have also shown that the oxyR-regulated proteins are synthesized during the ¢rst 10 min after treatment with hydrogen peroxide [3]. These results predict that OxyR is possibly oxidized immediately after the addition of hydrogen peroxide, and re-reduced after the removal of the added hydrogen peroxide by cellular factors. To examine these issues, I ¢rst examined the redox states of OxyR after exposure of the cells to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3). Without hydrogen peroxide treatment, most OxyR molecules are observed in the reduced form in aerobically growing cells (Fig. 3, lane 1, see also Fig. 1, lane 3), although the possibility of the presence of small amounts of the oxidized form cannot be excluded because of the limitations of electrophoretic separation of the reduced and oxidized forms under the experimental conditions used in this study. When sampling was carried out at 1 min after the addition of hydrogen peroxide, a signi¢cant fraction of OxyR was found to be in the disul¢de-bonded form. The amount of the oxidized form increased with exposure to increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration, and ¢nally, virtually all the OxyR was found to be in the oxidized form at 40 WM hydrogen peroxide. These results are consistent with the notion that the OxyR protein acts as a sensitive biological sensor of hydrogen peroxide in the cells. Next, I examined the redox states of OxyR at 30 s intervals after the addition of hydrogen peroxide, to directly measure the lifetime of the oxidized form of OxyR in vivo (Fig. 4). After exposure to 200 WM hydrogen peroxide, most of the OxyR was observed in its disul¢de-bonded form even at the earliest time point examined (30 s), and then rapidly converted back to the reduced form during subsequent culture. Reduction of the oxidized form was complete within 5 min in the wild-type strain. The time course and hydrogen peroxide concentrationdependency of the oxidation and reduction of OxyR in vivo were consistent with previously observed kinetics of the OxyR response1 . Together with in vitro observations [11], these results indicate that reversible intramolecular disul¢de bond formation between Cys-199 and -208 regulates the activity of OxyR as a transcriptional activator. In this study, I demonstrated that the oxidized form of OxyR can be separated from the reduced form by SDSPAGE under non-reducing conditions. This method allows

us to directly determine the redox states of OxyR during stress response in vivo. A remarkable feature of the response was the rapid oxidation-reduction switch. A similar rapid response has been observed in E. coli for another well-characterized response to oxidative stress, namely the superoxide stress response regulated by SoxR [1,2]. SoxR functions as both a sensor for increased superoxide anion radicals and as a transcriptional activator for the genes responding to the stress. The activity of SoxR as a transcriptional activator is regulated by one electron oxidation-reduction of the [2Fe-2S] cluster responding to the increase in superoxide radicals [21,22]. Similar to the OxyR response, SoxR is rapidly activated (within 2 min) by redox agents, and is rapidly deactivated after the removal of the stress [23]. OxyR and SoxR protect cells against oxidative stress mainly by inducing the expression of important frontline defense enzymes, such as catalase hydroperoxidase I and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase, respectively. Therefore, the ability to quickly respond to changes in the environment is essential for these sensor/activator proteins.
