Annexins are members of a third class of amphipathic proteins distinct from soluble and integral membrane proteins, They are readily soluble in water and interact with membranes in a calcium dependent manner. Some members also form voltage-gated calcium specific channels when associated with membranes; a property of integral membrane proteins (see [6] for a review).

The four tandem repents arc similarly folded into compact domains consisting of five n-hcliccs wound into a right-handed super-helix. Four hcliccs, A,B,D,E, liavc their axes approximately parallel, whcrcas the connecting helix C lies flat. The four domains arc nrrangcd in an almost planar, compact array such that domains II and III and K and IV, respectively, form tight molecules with arsproximate two-fold symmetry. A third local dyad (dyad A) relates modules (II, III) and (1,IV). All four domains have their molecular axes as defined by the axes of heliccs A,B,D,E similarly oriented. Dyad A marks the center of the molecule and a very prominent hydrophilic pore, which we associated with the calcium specific channel in annexin VII and V [6,9]. In our previous analysis we could not define the calchlm binding sites which seem to be partly occupied only in the hexagonal crystal form. The present study describes the analysis of the rhombohedral crystal form of human annexin V. (The nomenclature of structural elements of annexin V has been introduced by Huber et al. (I990) and is used here (see Fig. 3 in Huber et al., I990). These crystals grow t,ogether with the hexagonal form but tolerate transfer to solutions with very high calcium and lanthanum concentrations. Under these conditions five calcium sites I5

Some rhombohedral NAT1 crystals were soaked several days in 3 M ammonium sulfate, pH 8.5, containing 10 mM EDTA and thin transferred into a solutionwith 50 mM La(NO& (Table 1). Also under these conditions, cracks develop and anneal (EDLA).

Cufciurn sites The primary goal of the study described was to define the calcium binding sites, which had not been identified in the hexagonal crystal form. The calcium sites Cal,&3 were identified by high electron density peaks in Fourier maps of CAPL and characteristic ligation by oxygens. Two more sites (Ca4,§) were indicated by lanthanum binding in the LAGP and EDLA derivates. These five sites and their general locations are indicated in Fig. 2 superimposed onto a &-chain trace, They are located on the convex face of the molecule in

At the underside of the salcium binding loops solvent molecules are located bound to the carbonyl oxygens of KlOl, A103 (Cal) and K260, A262 (Ca2). A solvent is also at the Ca3 loop, although less wel defined. The structural features of the Cal-3 binding sites are dissimilar to `E-F hand' calcium sites of parvalbumins [ 1S-201, but related to the calcium site of phospholipase A2 ([21], see Fig. S) where the calcium is also sequestered by a glycine-rich loop and a spatially close but sequentially discontinuous Asp residue [211. Calcium prefers seven-coordination by oxygens located approximately at the vertices of a pentagonal bipyramid [l9]. The three calcium ions in annexin V have 6 oxygen iigands and are unsaturated by coordination and charge therefore. The seventh unoccupied coordination site may accept the phosphoryl moiety of 19

There are few data of the stoichiometry of calcium binding to annexins due to complications by the synergism with phospholipid binding and the relatively low affinity.

Protein pl I binds to the N-terminal tail of ~36 located at the concave fact [24-293. Binding of anionic phospholipids, to anncxin V is calcium dcpcndcnt [X2,35]. The phospholipid calcium interaction might bc direct or allostcric. The obscrvation that calcium binding in CAPL causes very littlc structural change at the calcium sites compared to NA'TI and the hcxagcnal form structure argues for the former. The unoccupied scvcnth coordination site in Cal-3 and its oscupntion by a sulfate at Cn3 suggests that the phosphoryl moiety is in clircct contact with the calcium. Additional interactions of the acidic head groups with the conserved basic residues mentioned might strengthen binding, Thcrc is no nearby hydrophobic binding site for the his-acyl moiety of a phospholipid. The calcium and putative phospholipid-binding sites are at protruding ioops and constitute the probable docking sites of annexin to membranes. Annexin VI (~68) monolayer interaction causes an increase in surface pressure indicating at least partial insertion [28] and/or generation of disorder and expansion of the covered membrane area. The peripheral wall of the annexin molecule is polar (see Fig. 5b in [I]). Deep penetration is improbable therefore, except when accompanied by an extensive rearrangement of the surrounding phospholipids (`inverted micelle'). Alternatively there may be mainly surface attachment through the specific calcium phospholipid headgroup interaction associated with local restructuring of the proximal and, to a lesser degree, the distal leaflet of the membrane. Local rearrangement of the phospholipid under the docking area may make the membrane permeable, specifically between Cal and Ca2 which border the cen20

It is formed by the symmct ry-rcloccd hclis HA-Ca I turn-hclis IIB and helix IV&CM turn-helix IVlu motifs, rcspcctivcly, The chamlcl is funnel-shaped with the open end at the calcium ions. 10 chorgcd, 6 acidic and 4 basic rcsiducs, of which most arc invariant in the annexin family, project into the channel and fill it together with a few bound solvent molecules. Thcsc lattcr indicate pcrmcability of the channel. Voltage-gating is a particularly interesting property of the anncxin channel. Thcrc arc different ways by which an electric field may act on the channel, Charged residues within the channel may rearrange or a global relative motion of the modules may occur. Calculations of the electrostatic potential have shown that the annexin V molcsule is strongly dipolar. The arrow superimposed on the G-plot of annexin V (Fig. 1) connects the centre points of the positive and negative electrostatic potential calculated from the atomic coordinates for pH 8.5. It documents the substantial asymmetry in the charge distribution between modules (IJV) and (11,111). An electrical field across the membrane would exert different forces on the modules and may cause a relative motion of the kind seen in Fig, 1. Rearrangement of individual residues or the modules as a whole may stabilize the open or closed states of the central channel and thus regulate calcium inflow. 3 2.
