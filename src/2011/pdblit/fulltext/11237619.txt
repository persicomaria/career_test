The determination by NMR of the solution structure of the phosphorylated enzyme IIB (P-IIBChb) of the N,NH -diacetylchitobiose-speci®c phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli is presented. Most of the backbone and side-chain resonances were assigned using a variety of mostly heteronuclear NMR experiments. The remaining resonances were assigned with the help of the structure calculations. NOE-derived distance restraints were used in distance geometry calculations followed by molecular dynamics and simulated annealing protocols. In addition, combinations of ambiguous restraints were used to resolve ambiguities in the NOE assignments. By combining sets of ambiguous and unambiguous restraints into new ambiguous restraints, an error function was constructed that was less sensitive to information loss caused by assignment uncertainties. The ®nal set of structures had a pairwise Ê Ê rmsd of 0.59 A and 1.16 A for the heavy atoms of the backbone and sidechains, respectively. Comparing the P-IIBChb solution structure with the previously determined NMR and X-ray structures of the wild-type and the Cys10Ser mutant shows that signi®cant differences between the structures are limited to the active-site region. The phosphoryl group at the active-site cysteine residue is surrounded by a loop formed by residues 10 through 16. NOE and chemical shift data suggest that the phosphoryl group makes hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide protons of residues 12 and 15. The binding mode of the phosphoryl group is very similar to that of the protein tyrosine phosphatases. The differences observed are in accordance with the presumption that IIBChb has to be more resistant to hydrolysis than the protein tyrosine phosphatases. We propose a proton relay network by which a transfer occurs between the cysteine SH proton and the solvent via the hydroxyl group of Thr16.

NMR Structure of Cysteinyl-phosphorylated IIBChb

Introduction
Enzyme IIBChb of Escherichia coli is the central energy-coupling domain of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) of E. coli for the carbohydrate N,NH -diacetylchitobiose ((GlcNac)2). The chb operon of E. coli was originally named cel operon and was thought to be a cryptic operon coding for the enzymes of the cellobiose PTS.1,2 Keyhani & Roseman3 found that the operon is normally inducible and codes for the N,NH -diacetylchitobiose PTS. Here, we use the new chb nomenclature. After transport from the periplasmic to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane by enzyme IICChb, the carbohydrate is phosphorylated by IIBChb at the expense of PEP. Enzyme IIBChb receives its phosphoryl group via a series of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions involving enzyme I, HPr and ®nally IIAChb. For general reviews on the PEP-dependent PTS we refer to Postma et al.,4 Meadow et al.,5 Lolkema et al.,6 Saier & Reizer,7 Robillard & Broos.8 In the case of the mannitol PTS, a conformational coupling was proposed between the phosphorylation-state of the IIB domain of the IICBA protein and transport of the carbohydrate through the IIC domain.9 ± 11 E. coli IIBChb is a protein of 106 amino acid residues and differs in this respect from IIB domains for most other carbohydrates, which usually are integral parts of multi-domain proteins. IIBChb has been shown to be phosphorylated at residue Cys10.12 The crystal structure of the wild-type and the solution structure of the Cys10Ser mutant were solved previously.13,14 The work presented here describes the structure of the wild-type enzyme, which carries a phosphoryl group at the active-site residue Cys10. The only other classes of enzymes where phosphorylation is known to occur on a cysteine residue are the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases)15,16 and dual speci®city (Tyr/Thr) protein phosphatases.17,18 In both cases, as well as in IIBChb, the active cysteine lies in a strand-loop-helix motif at the end of the b-strand, and the phosphoryl group is stabilized by backbone amide hydrogen bond donors.

the pH instability, caused by the release of pyruvate, were generally limited, but most pronounced for the backbone resonances of His5.

Resonance assignments Backbone and side-chain assignments Most of the assignments for the backbone resonances were readily obtained, except for the Ser15 HN resonance, which could be detected only in NOE traces of 15N and 13C edited 3D-NOESY and 2D-NOESY spectra. Signals at 10.7 ppm from Ser15 Ha,Hb1,Hb2 and Met14 Ha were found, to which Ser15 HN could be assigned. Lys3 HN appears to be degenerate. We observed two sets of resonances that could be assigned to Lys3 and are both consistent with the Lys4 assignments in all spectra. They differ signi®cantly only in the chemical shift value of the amide proton. We presume that this is caused by partial hydrolysis of the N-terminal methionine residue. Because in this study we focussed on the active-site structure speci®cally, and Lys3 is located at the opposite side of the enzyme, we did not pursue the assignment and conformation of this residue in further detail. To avoid distortion of the structure by inconsistent restraints, NOEs that were speci®cally assigned to the resonances of the Lys3 with the lower ®eld amide chemical shift were not used for generating distance restraints. The backbone experiments aimed at observation of the b-resonances, viz. the HBHA(CBCA) (CO)NH, CBCA(CO)NH, HCACBCO together with the 3D-HCCH-TOCSY, the CbHd and CbHe for the aromatic resonances, and the 15N-TOCSYHSQC, were not suf®cient to complete the sidechain resonance assignments. Most of the remaining side-chain resonances were assigned during the structure calculations from the 13C-HSQCNOESY, by searching for unexplained cross-peak intensity at the resonance frequencies of nearby nuclei in the following manner. Planes perpendicular to the o3 domain were taken corresponding to the frequencies of assigned protons expected to show intra-residue and sequential NOEs. Often inspection of a contour plot of the resulting data, sometimes combined with NOE-intensity and chemical shift information, allowed many of the remaining side-chain resonances to be assigned directly. The methyl resonances of methionine residues 14, 23 and 63 were assigned from the NOE spectra alone, based on their typical 1H and 13C chemical shift values and contacts to nearby nuclei. Currently we have assignments for all nuclei except Val32 Cg2 (possible overlap with Cg1), Ser21 Hb2 (possible overlap with Hb1), Ser81-Cb1 (possible overlap with Ca) and Met1 Hg,Cg, and exchangeable protons. The chemical shifts are deposited at the BioMagResBank (see Materials and Methods).

Results
Phosphorylation of IIBChb Under the conditions of high buffer capacity used (see Materials and Methods), the samples of phosphorylated IIBChb remained completely phosphorylated for approximately one week. This was inferred by monitoring the presence of resonances speci®c for the unphosphorylated form of the enzyme in a 15N-HSQC. The samples could be regenerated by dialysis against fresh buffer, but the spectra of the resulting samples showed a considerable number of additional resonances compared with a fresh sample. Peak shifts from

995 Structure calculations The use of wide (square well potential) distance bounds for restraining can easily obscure information present in small differences between NOEs. These can nevertheless be signi®cant, for example if they occur in the same relaxation frame. Therefore we prefer to use tight bounds with a relatively low force constant. We noticed that local convergence to a low target function is somewhat better in the searching phase if tight restraints are used. It also makes comparison of experimental and calculated data more straightforward. However, the resulting set of structures will likely be biased towards low rmsd values. In the ®nal round of structure calculations, all unambiguous restraints were used in an embedding procedure to generate 32 sets of 4D coordinates. These were subsequently further re®ned in 4D and 3D against all available restraint data using distance bounds driven dynamics (DDD). Finally, several rounds of re®nement were performed in explicit solvent using GROMACS. Because we focussed on the region around the active site, from the 32 structures calculated in the last round eight with relatively low per-residue Rx 2 values19 for the residues in the active site (residues 10-16, 59, 84) were selected for further analysis. The average rmsd values of non-hydrogen atoms Ê were 0.59 and 1.16 A for the backbone atoms and Ê side-chain atoms, respectively, and 0.38 and 0.88 A for residues 3-100, respectively. Figure 3 shows the differences between the selected structures, as well as the differences between the representative structures and the wild-type and Cys10Ser structures.

Shift differences between Cys10Ser-IIBChb and P-IIBChb The differences between the Cys10Ser mutant and phospho-IIBChb backbone chemical shifts are shown in Figure 1(a). The largest differences occur in the neighborhood of the active-site region: residues 9-16, 39-44, 59-60 and 84. For the remaining residues, the chemical shifts, and consequently the structure in solution, are very similar. The resonances of His5 also show a larger shift, but this is more likely caused by the high sensitivity of this residue to pH instabilities during the measurements. The exact changes in chemical shifts upon phosphorylation of the wild-type enzyme are not known, since the resonance assignments of the wild-type enzyme are not available. However, from the differences between the 15N-HSQC spectra shown in Figure 1(b), we can conclude that they will be of the same order of magnitude as the differences between the phosphorylated wild-type and the Cys10Ser mutant. Structure determination NOE assignments The number of NOE intensities collected and the resulting number of restraints generated for each structure calculation or re®nement protocol are listed in Table 1. We collected as many peaks as possible from the 13C and 15N edited NOESY spectra, with the exception of peaks from some very crowded spectral regions. These usually do not contain much extra information because of the high level of ambiguity and the uncertainty in the peak positions and/or resonance assignments. The number of restraints used for each residue is displayed in Figure 2.

To analyze the local correspondence with the data of the structures we used the assigned NOEintensities to calculate sixth-root R-factors for each residue separately. The results are given in Figure 5. Except for the termini, for which the low

number of restraints caused convergence problems, there are no extreme outliers. Figure 6 shows a comparison of the observed and calculated sixth-root NOE intensities for the eight selected structures. Outliers are easily noticed in such a plot. Approximately 99.9 % of the Ê restraints correspond within 1.0 A to the distances in the structures. The maximum disagreement per Ê structure ranges from 1.5-2.0 A. Relatively large discrepancies occur for the side-chain amide protons of Gln68 located at the surface of the protein, to side-chain protons of Leu64 and amide and side-chain protons of Lys74. In the models, the conformation of the Gln68 side-chain varies from the vicinity of 64 to that of 74. Calculating ensemble-averaged NOE intensities for two structures comprising both variants yielded signi®cantly better correspondence with the observed intensities for this side-chain. Therefore, it is likely that the violations are caused by mobility of the Gln68 side-chain between the vicinity of residues 64 and 74, which cannot be modelled correctly in one structure. In order to have an independent con®rmation of the observed differences in the P-loop compared with the wild-type X-ray structure, 15N-1H dipolar coupling measurements were performed21 We were able to measure dipolar couplings for the backbone amide groups of 73 residues in the oriented phase. We could measure isotropic

the data. An average isotropic value of 93.3 Hz was taken to calculate the contribution of the dipolar coupling if no measured reference value was available. The optimal molecular alignment tensor was determined for each model by minimizing the

Discussion
From the calculated structures and the chemical shift differences we conclude that the structure of the phosphorylated form of enzyme IIBChb differs from the previously determined structures of the IIBChb wild-type13 and the Cys10ser mutant14 only in the active-site region. This region consists of the P-loop (residues 10-16), and the side-chains of residues Gln59 and Tyr84. Figure 7(a) shows a superposition of the backbone of the Cys10Ser mutant, of the wild-type and of the phosphorylated protein. The major secondary structure elements, a four-stranded parallel b-sheet ¯anked by ®ve a-helices, show no signi®cant changes upon phosphorylation, and can be superimposed very precisely on the X-ray structure. It was already proposed by the authors of the IIBChb X-ray structure13 that, due to crystal contacts, the conformation of the P-loop in the X-ray structure would not be representative for the conformation in solution, but that instead it would assume a more cradle-like conformation, like in the PTPases. Indeed, as shown in Table 3, the dipolar coupling measurements show large discrepancies with the calculated values for several residues of the P-loop, when the X-ray structure was used as the model. This con®rms that the structure of the P-loop of phosphorylated IIBChb in solution is signi®cantly different from that in the X-ray structure. On the other hand, in the representative NMR structure, the individual 15N-1H vectors of the P-loop need a rotation of maximally 7  to bring them into agreement with the data.

The differences with the (Cys10Ser)IIB NMR structures are, in general, within the limits of accuracy of the latter, but the P-loop is much less well de®ned in the mutant structures. Although no relaxation or exchange data are available to give information on the mobility of the P-loop, it seems reasonable to assume that after phosphorylation the mobility of the P-loop is less than in the wildtype and Cys10Ser mutant because of the lack of suitable hydrogen bond acceptors in the latter two. Keyhani et al22 found that the sedimentation coef®cient increases upon phosphorylation. This indicates that upon phosphorylation, phospho-IIBChb becomes more compact or that changes in hydration occur, and agrees well with a model in which the mobile P-loop in the unphosphorylated protein becomes more de®ned, and/or less hydrated in the phosphorylated form. From the structures determined thus far, there is no evidence for a conformational change (other than in the active site) that could be able to provide a conformational coupling mechanism for coupling phosphorylation and transport. Nevertheless, the chemical shift differences are, on the average, quite large compared to similar data for HPr,23 where observable shift differences upon phosphorylation are limited to a very few residues close to the phosphoryl group. As IIBChb has a high number of aromatic amino acid residues in its core, small changes in dynamic behaviour in the vicinity of these residues might explain the relatively large chemical shift effects. Several groups of the P-loop act in stabilizing the phosphoryl group. The backbone amide protons of Ala12, Gly13, Met14 and Ser15 are within hydrogen bonding distance of the oxygen atoms of the phosphoryl group. The amide protons of Ala12 and Ser15 probably have the strongest hydrogen bonding interactions with the phosphoryl oxygen atoms. They show a very acidic (down®eld) chemical shift value in the phosphorylated form of the enzyme, which is often indicative of close interaction with a negatively charged ion. Other

hydrogen bond donors are the side-chain amide group of Gln59 and possibly the hydroxyl group of Ser15. The NH2-group of Gln59 appears to be acting as a bridge between the phosphoryl group oxygen atoms and the hydroxyl group of Tyr84, which has moved away from the phosphoryl group when compared to the X-ray structure of the wild-type, and the NMR structure of the Cys10Ser mutant (see Figure 7(b)). The amide proton of Gly13 is probably hydrogen bonded to Cys10 Sg, as indicated by the unusually short distance between these atoms. Also the g-hydroxyl moiety of Thr16 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the Cys10 Sg in a number of the structures. Table 4 summar-

izes the relevant distances in the eight selected structures. Figure 8 shows a drawing of the active site. The PTPases and the dual speci®city (Tyr/Thr) protein phosphatases are the only known enzymes that, like the IIB domains/protein of the PTS, use a phosphocysteine residue in the catalytic cycle. The active site of IIBChb is similar to that of the PTPases. The X-ray structure of a phosphorylated PTPase (PTP1B) has been solved, taking advantage of a Gln281Ala mutation that has a reduced dephosphorylation rate.24 Comparison shows that the structures of the active sites of phospho-IIBChb and phospho-(Gln281Ala)PTP1B are very similar (see

Figure 8. A drawing of the binding mode of the phosphoryl group in the active site with the hydrogen bond interactions indicated (broken lines).

Figure 9). The heavy backbone atoms, N, Ca and CH , of residues 10-15 and the heavy side-chain atoms of residue 10 can be superimposed with an Ê rmsd of 0.54 A. In both structures, the cysteine residue is located at the end of a b-strand in a sheet-loop-helix motif. The a-helix points with its N-terminal side to the phosphoryl group, thereby stabilizing the negative charge.25 The g-hydroxyl group of Ser222 (residue i  7 from the cysteine) of PTP1B has been proposed to polarize Sg of the phosphocysteine residue in order to facilitate hydrolysis of the phosphoryl group.24 We ®nd that in IIBChb the hydroxyl group of the Thr at position i  6, is positioned in a comparable way, but with a somewhat larger distance to Sg, on average. Probably the (tentative) hydrogen bond of the Cys10 side-chain Sg with the Thr16 g-hydroxyl group is weaker than the comparable hydrogen bond of Ser222 in PTPIB. In PTP1B, the cysteine residue is assumed to be in the ionized form before phosphorylation.24,26 There are no data available on the protonation state of the cysteine residue in IIBChb. As there are no charged groups in the neighborhood of the cysteine residue in IIBChb, unlike the PTPases and some other enzymes IIB, we assume that the cysteine residue in the free wild-type enzyme is protonated, at the pH used. In that case, the short distance between the hydroxyl group of Thr16 and Sg of Cys10 (even shorter in the wild-type X-ray structure) suggests the presence of a proton relay pathway from Cys10 Sg via Thr16 Og1 to a solvent water molecule. Although Thr16 Og is not very solvent-exposed, it is located close to the surface and only small changes are necessary to make it accessible for a solvent molecule.

Our observation that the distance between the hydroxyl group and the cysteine Sg in phosphoIIBChb is somewhat larger than in PTP1B, and the fact that Ser222 in PTP1B is not accessible to solvent, is most likely related to the hydrolysis behaviour of both enzymes. In the PTPases, the PTP1B phosphoryl group needs to be hydrolyzed after phosphorylation, while the phosphoryl group on IIB needs to be stable until it can be transferred to the carbohydrate. A larger distance in the free phospho-IIBChb could serve to increase the resistance to hydrolysis. It is feasible that the binding of IIAChb or IICChb/carbohydrate induces a small conformational change in the active site that reduces the distance between these two groups, thereby facilitating the proton transfer or possibly, in the case that the wild-type form is ionized, stabilizing an ionized cysteine. Modelling studies on the transition state IIAChbP-IIBChb, indicate that the free backbone hydrogen bond acceptors of residues 11-13 in IIBChb are accessible to an arginine side-chain of IIAChb that is located close to the active histidine residue of IIAChb (R. de Jong & B.W. Dijkstra, unpublished results). This would provide a possible mechanism for IIAChb to in¯uence the conformation of the P-loop of IIBChb. In the PTPases, hydrolysis of the phosphoryl group starts with a solvent molecule that is activated by Asp129 (not visible in Figure 9) to make an in-line nucleophilic attack on the phosphoryl group. If we can draw a parallel between the PTPases and the enzymes IIB, we would expect the presence of a charged or polar group that is able to accept a proton from the hydroxyl group of the sugar bound by the IIB-IIC complex. As no obvious candidate is available on IIBChb, that group will probably be located in enzyme IIC. The currently presented structure of phosphoIIBChb provides clues about the mechanism of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the enzyme, and can be used as a starting point for kinetic measurements and site-directed mutagenesis experiments to further unravel the mechanism.

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation Transformation of E. coli strain W3110 with plasmid pJR-BLIIB, carrying the gene for IIBChb with control elements for the temperature-sensitive lambda-repressor, culturing and puri®cation of the wild-type IIBChb was performed as described for the Cys10Ser-mutant.27 About 20 mg of both 15N and 13C/15N labeled protein was obtained. The enzyme was phosphorylated by addition of 1 % (w/w) equivalents of enzyme I, HPr and IIAChb, in TAGbuffer (10 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.0), 5 % (w/v) glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaN3) with 5 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2 and 13.3 mM mono(cyclohexyl-ammonium)-PEP. Phosphorylation of IIBChb was con®rmed by the observation of a shift in the major protein band using nondenaturing PAGE.

Figure 9. Stereoviews of the active sites of phospho-IIBChb (P-IIB) and PTP-1B Q281A (PTP1B, PDB code: A5Y.PDB). The Figure was made using the program MOLMOL.63 Three water molecules in the PTP1B active site are colored light blue.

The phosphoryl group of P-IIBChb is sensitive to hydrolysis under the experimental conditions used and, as a consequence, during the entire span of the experiment pyruvate is being produced, whilst PEP is being consumed. The release of pyruvate lowers the pH of the sample, causing shifts in resonances, which in turn can result in severe artifacts in the spectra. We chose a relatively high buffer concentration compared to the NMR work on the Cys10Ser mutant to reduce these effects as much as possible. The phosphorylation reactions were started by the addition of a PEP solution that was brought to pH 7.0 by the addition of NaHCO3. Complete phosphorylation of IIBChb, as judged from the spectra, was maintained during the recording of the NMR spectra for approximately one week at 295 K under the conditions listed below. In some cases the samples were regenerated by dialysing against fresh buffer without enzymes and PEP.

NMR spectroscopy All measurements were carried out on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a pulsed-®eld gradient probe. The spectra were recorded at 295 K. An unlabeled sample was used to acquire a 2D-NOESY spectrum. The 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 15 N-TOCSY-HSQC28 ± 30 were performed as described27 on 15N-labeled protein. Pulsed-®eld gradients were added to reduce phase-cycling. A 13C,15N-labeled sample was used to acquire the following 3D triple resonance experiments: CBCA(CO)NH, HBHA(CBCA)(CO)NH, CBCANH, CANH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, COCAH, (CO)N(CO)CAH, HCACBCO, CbHe and CbHd (for aromatic ring protons), HCCH-TOCSY, 13C-HSQC-NOESY, high-resolution constant-time 13C-HSQC. Additionally. 1 JNH-modulated HSQC spectra at 288 K and at 298 K were recorded to determine residual dipolar couplings in oriented C8E5/octanol medium31 The relevant parameters and references for the acquired spectra are listed in Table 5. Resonance assignments We performed a considerable number of the sidechain assignments during the structure calculations, on the basis of the NOE spectra, because the other spectra were insuf®cient to obtain the complete assignments of side-chain resonances. Numerous cycles of structure calculations, resonance assignments and re-evaluation of the assignments were performed. Details on various

aspects of the generation of restraints and structure calculations are outlined in the following paragraphs. NOE assignments The cross-peaks for each NOE spectrum were divided into two lists according to whether the peaks were assigned to a speci®c resonance (list a) or not (list b). For list b, all assignments that were possible on the basis of the assigned chemical shift lists were generated. Acceptance margins for the NOE assignments were based on the spread in the assigned shifts in the spectrum or spectra, and on the digital resolution of the spectral data. Subsequently the list of possible assignments was cleaned up by removing all the pairs with distances larÊ ger than 8.0 A in a reference set of structures. Assign-

ments that were already present in list a were removed from list b. In the ®rst stages of calculations, the NMR structures of the Cys10Ser mutant and the X-ray structures of the wild-type were used as reference set, in later stages the structures obtained from previous rounds of structure calculations were used. Generation of distance restraints For the generation of distance restraints, we used various protocols depending on the stage of re®nement and possibilities of the software used. For conversion of NOE-intensitiesI (peak maxima) to restraint distances R we used the relation R G IÀ1/6, where the scaling factor is chosen such that the average ratio between apparent model and observed distances

NMR Structure of Cysteinyl-phosphorylated IIBChb equals one: hRapp/Rappi  1. The calibration was done calc obs with the unambiguously assigned NOEs. From the scaled distances, upper (and lower) bounds were generated, in a manner depending on the structure calculation or re®nement program used. Spin diffusion corrections Restraint distances were corrected for multi-spin effects, ``spin diffusion'',32 by comparing the apparent distances in a reference model for a given restraint with and without spin-diffusion correction. Apparent distances, taking into account spin diffusion, were calculated as described by Kemmink & Scheek33 The rotational correlation time was estimated from plots of the observed data against the data calculated using different values of the correlation time. The standard deviation of the ratio NOEobs/NOEcalc for all NOEs was smallest at a value of 11 ns. This value of the correlation time agrees well with the rule-of-thumb that says that t % Mr (ns/kDa). The spin diffusion correction (SDC) that was applied equals the difference between the two apparent distances: SDC  Rspindif À Rcalc, where the R values are the calc inverse sixth-power summed distances for a set of spin pairs. If a cluster of structures was used to calculate the corrections (for the embedding and DDD stages), the highest correction distance found in the structures (SDCmax) was added to the upper bound and the lowest correction distance (SDCmin) to the lower bound, in order to re¯ect the widest possible bounds compatible with the reference models. If one structure was used to calculate the corrections (for the re®nement using GROMACS), the correction was straightforwardly added to the restraint distance (upper and/or lower bound). Use of ambiguous distance restraints For the use of ambiguous restraints,34 including the treatment of prochiral ambiguities, we used the approach as explained by AB et al.,14 with some modi®cations. Upper and lower bounds were generated for all unambiguously assigned NOE peaks. From the NOE intensities that were not yet assigned unambiguously, ambiguous restraints with only upper bounds were generated. Aromatic ring resonances from the 13C-HSQCNOESY were excluded from this procedure, as they showed complicated multiplet-like signals because of incomplete decoupling of the 13C nuclei during acquisition. This resulted in cases where several peaks in these multiplets were assigned to the same resonance pair. In these cases the added intensities have to be considered as lower estimates for the total intensity. Consequently, from these intensities only upper bounds were generated. Due to crowding of resonances in the spectra, or uncertainties in the frequency assignments, it occurred that some spin pairs appeared as possible assignments for more than one NOE peak. In this situation we speak of ``assignment overlap'' and the assignments we call ``shared assignments''. By using the standard approach, in which the possible assignments for each peak are simply used as pairs in an ambiguous restraint, we lose information, because only one close pair, namely that of the shared assignment, is needed to satisfy all the restraints that share that pair. To prevent information loss in these cases we applied the following procedure.

1005
(1) We added an ambiguous restraint corresponding to the sum of the intensities to the list, containing as pairs all the possible assignments of the original peaks. (2) Furthermore, we added a restraint corresponding to the lowest intensity, with all possible assignments of the original peak except the shared assignment. These extra restraints ensure that (1) the sum of intensities of two NOEs with shared assignments is also restrained, instead of just the highest intensity, and (2) at least two different pairs are necessary to satisfy the two NOE intensities. Further complications due to assignments shared by more than two peaks have also been treated. Further details will be provided elsewhere (E.A. & R.M.S., unpublished results). After generating additional combined restraints to deal with shared assignments for each NOE spectrum separately and adding the resulting restraint lists, redundant restraints were removed from the list. Treatment of prochiral ambiguities In the DDD stage with 3D coordinates, prochiralities were handled by using the ¯ipping chiralities approach as described by van Nuland et al.35 For the re®nement of structures in explicit solvent using GROMACS, prochiralities were handled by the construction of appropriate combinations of ambiguous distance restraints, as explained by AB et al.14 (and E.A. & R.M.S., unpublished results) in order to make the restraints insensitive to the interchange of prochiral groups. Stereospeci®c assignments of prochiral pairs were done if they were consistent for all calculated structures after the stages of embedding and DDD in 4D and in 3D. For use in GROMACS, non-assigned prochiralities were expanded into ambiguous restraints, and subsequently, together with the other restraints, expanded into appropriate sums and subsets. After distance restrained simulated annealing in GROMACS, the different possible assignments for each prochiral center were compared. Per-residue violations and R-factors were calculated for each possible prochiral assignment. If one assignment consistently showed lower violations or R-factors for all structures, the assignment was ®xed in the next round of calculations. The following R-factor was used: Rx  2 ÆDÀ1 À DÀ1 2 obs calc ÆDÀ1 2 obs

where Dobs and Dcalc are the apparent model and experimental distances and the data was scaled such that hDcalc/Dobsi  1. Structure calculations Structure calculations were done in three stages. (1) All unambiguous restraints were used in a distance geometry (DG) procedure to create 4D coordinates. (2) In order to take advantage of all available unambiguous and ambiguous NOE data to resolve prochiral ambiguities, we performed distance driven dynamics (DDD),14,36 ± 38 with a high-temperature search phase in 4D, where the energy required to invert chiralities is strongly reduced compared to 3D. Subsequent DDD was done to anneal the structures to 3D coordinates. (3) In order to improve the stereochemical quality, we subjected the structures to further re®nement in a physically more realistic force ®eld in explicit solvent, using the

1006
molecular dynamics software GROMACS.39 Three separate sets of restraints suitable for these structure calculation and re®nement protocols were prepared. Distance restraints for 54 hydrogen bonds were de®ned. Distance geometry and distance driven dynamics The unambiguous upper and lower bounds, corrected for spin diffusion, were collected in a matrix. Distances Ê Ê of 0.05D  0.05D2/A and 0.05D À 0.05D2/A were added to and subtracted from the upper and lower bounds, respectively. The lower bounds were adjusted to make sure that the difference between the upper and lower Ê bound was at least 1.25 A. Additional bounds were calculated using triangule inequalities. A submatrix of this smoothed matrix, consisting of all the non-hydrogen atoms and the amide and methine hydrogen atoms, was used to calculate 4D coordinates using the EMBED algorithm.38,40 The distance driven dynamics approach was used to re®ne the structures further. The error function consisted of all ambiguous and unambiguous restraints and hydrogen bonds, as well chiral restraints that impose the correct handedness for asymmetric carbon atoms and a-helices. The lower bounds were reÊ adjusted to have at least 0.5 A difference with the upper bounds. One thousand steps of dynamics in 4D were performed at 1000 K. During the last 500 steps a force was applied to minimize the fourth coordinate. Subsequently, simulated annealing was done by temperature coupling to an external thermal bath of 500, 300, 200 and 1 K, for 100 steps each.41 After projection of the 4D coordinates into 3D space,14 the 3D coordinates were subjected to further conjugategradient optimization and DDD calculations, using the same error function in a protocol similar to that described above. Robust DDD In the earlier stages of the re®nement, there was still a considerable number of errors in the spectral assignments and consequently, in the restraints. We modi®ed the DDD algorithm in order to make it less sensitive to large errors. During each time-step, the n largest violations were determined, where n is typically 10, and the force resulting from these violations was either discarded, or scaled down typically ®ve to tenfold. In this way we allowed for the restraint list to contain a number of errors, without the structures being severely distorted by them. Large violations in the resulting structures were subsequently used as guidance for manual reevaluation of the assignments. GROMACS In order to improve the quality of the structures we used GROMACS to perform simulated annealing in a physically more realistic force-®eld with explicit solvent. For these runs, we used calibrated and spin-diffusion corrected tight bounds, Dup  Dlo  Dr, with a relatively low force constant for restraining. The restraints follow the following potential function: E  (Do/Dr) Â 1/2 Â kdr (D À Dr)2 , where Do  0.3 nm and kdr  2000 kJ mol { GROMACS User Manual version 2.0 can be found at http:md.chem.rug.nl/$gnx { http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu

NMR Structure of Cysteinyl-phosphorylated IIBChb nm2. For values of D larger than DHr  Dr  q/Dr (q  0.04 nm2) a linear potential energy function was Ê used. For restraints with an upperbound of 3.0 and 5.0 A Ê a violation of 1.0 A corresponds to an energy of 10 and 3.84 kJ molÀ1, respectively, while the maximum forces in these cases are reached at energies of 17.78 and 3.84 kJ molÀ1, respectively. For both ambiguous and unambiguous restraints, forces were applied proportional to the derivative of the potential function. In order to increase the possible time-step, we used a united atom force-®eld that was modi®ed to include dummy hydrogen atoms relative to which the restraint forces were de®ned.{42 The re®nement runs consisted of a high-temperature search phase starting at 500 K and a cooling phase, linearly to 300 K in 7.2 ps with time-steps of 4 fs, followed by a cooling stage from 300 K to 0 K in 3.2 ps with timesteps of 6 fs. The runs were repeated several times and the spin diffusion corrections were recalculated before each run from the results of the previous run. Usually sixth-root R-factors19 had converged to stable values after three rounds. Selection of structures Because the conformations of the active-site residues was most relevant to this study, we selected the structures that showed the smallest per residue Rx value for 2 the active-site residues 10-16, 59, 84. To obtain a high-quality representative model, we applied the following procedure. For each residue, the coordinates of the residue, with the lowest per-residue Rx value in the superimposed 32 structure bundle was 2 taken. The resulting (WTP-R) structure was energy minimized in the GROMACS force-®eld, with NOE restraints. To judge whether the structure converged to low energies, we subsequently subjected it to 55 steps of steepest descent minimization (WTP-F) without restraints.
