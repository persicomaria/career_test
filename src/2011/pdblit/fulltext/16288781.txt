Abstract The modulation by Zn2q of recombinant murine 5-hydroxytryptamine3A Z5-HT3A . receptor responses and its modification by Ca2q or Mg 2q were studied using whole-cell voltage clamp and radioligand binding techniques. In the absence of other added divalent cations Zn2q enhanced the response to 5-HT by increasing maximum peak current Z Imax . to a maximum of 122.5%, decreasing the rate of desensitization Zmaximum t 1r2 s 210%., and decreasing the EC 50 by approximately two fold. In the presence of Ca2q or Mg 2q, the effects of Zn2q on Imax and t 1r2 were still manifest, although higher Zn2q concentrations were required; however, the effect on EC 50 was abolished. Zn2q also enhanced w3 Hxagonist but not w3 Hxantagonist binding. We propose there is more than one Zn2q binding site on the 5-HT3 receptor molecule, and that one or more of these sites may also bind Ca2q and Mg 2q. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The transition metal ion, Zn2q, which is present in the nervous system at concentrations up to 200≠300 mM ZFrederickson et al., 1983; Palm et al., 1983., is known to modulate the function of a number of neurotransmittergated ion channels. It has been shown to be inhibitory at NMDA and GABA A receptors Ze.g. Westbrook and Mayer, 1987; Christine and Choi, 1990; Smart and Constanti, 1990., but can enhance the response of some glycine, glutamate and P2X receptors ZRassendren et al., 1990; Li et al., 1993; Bloomenthal et al., 1994.. The 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 Z5-HT3 . receptor belongs to the family of neurotransmitter-gated channels that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine, glycine and GABA A receptors ZMaricq et al., 1991.. In common with other members of this family,

the 5-HT3 receptor is a pentameric assembly of subunits ZBoess et al., 1995.. Two 5-HT3 receptor subunits, 5-HT3A ZMaricq et al., 1991. and 5-HT3B ZDavies et al., 1999. have been identified so far, and heterologously expressed receptors function with distinctive biophysical properties as either homo-oligomeric 5-HT3A or hetero-oligomeric 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B receptor subunit complexes ZDavies et al., 1999.. The 5-HT3B receptor subunit is expressed in many different tissues ZDubin et al., 1999., suggesting that many native 5-HT3 receptors may exist as heteromers; however, there is evidence that in some systems at least Ze.g. mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells and DRG neurones. 5-HT3 receptors can exist as homo-oligomers of 5-HT3A receptor subunits. Interestingly, there is evidence for both enhancement and inhibition of 5-HT3 receptor responses by Zn2q: Lovinger Z1991., Emerit et al. Z1993. and Uki and Narahashi Z1996. proposed that Zn2q was inhibitory, while Gill et al. Z1995. reported a biphasic effect, enhancement followed by inhibition at higher concentrations. The recent discovery of the 5-HT3B receptor subunit ZDavies et al., 1999., which may be a constituent of native 5-HT3 receptors, may explain at least some of these discrepancies. The aim of the current study was

therefore to examine the effects of Zn2q at homomeric 5-HT3A receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney ZHEK. cells, and, as Zn2q is one of a number of divalent cations that modify 5-HT3 receptor function, to examine the modification of these effects by Ca2q and Mg 2q.

around the cell being less than 100 ms ZSepulveda et al., ¥ 1991.. An interval of at least 3 min was given between applications to allow complete washout of 5-HT and recovery from desensitization of the receptors. All currents were recorded whilst the cells were voltage-clamped at y60 mV except where otherwise stated. All experiments were performed at room temperature Z20≠248C.. 2.3. Analysis of data All data were normalised to the response to a maximal concentration of 5-HT Z30 mM.. These were applied at frequent intervals Z10≠20 min. throughout the experiment. Concentration≠response data were fitted Zby non-linear least squares regression. to the logistic equation:

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Cell culture HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium ZDMEM.rF12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. They were stably transfected with DNA coding for the 5-HT3AZb. receptor subunit cloned from NIE-115 murine neuroblastoma cells in the eukaryotic expression vector pRcrCMV ZInVitrogen, Abingdon, UK. as previously described ZHope et al., 1993; Hargreaves et al., 1996.. For electrophysiological recording, cells were plated at low density onto 35 mm culture dishes ZFalcon, Becton Dickinson, UK, Oxford, UK. and used for experiments within 18≠36 h. For radioligand binding, the cells were grown in 90 mm dishes until confluent Z3≠5 days.. They were then removed from plates after washing with phosphate buffered saline by gentle scraping into HEPES buffer Z10 mM, pH 7.5. containing the following protease inhibitors: 1 mM EDTA, 50 mgrml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 mgrml bacitracin and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. Following homogenisation, they were frozen at y208C. On the day of assay, they were thawed, washed twice and then resuspended in HEPES buffer. 2.2. Electrophysiological recording Currents were recorded from isolated single cells in the whole-cell attached configuration as previously described ZHargreaves et al., 1996.. Briefly, cells were patched with borosilicate glass micropipettes ZClark Electromedical Instruments, Reading, UK. of resistance 2≠4 M V, back-filled with intracellular solution containing 140 mM CsCl, 1.0 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA Z10 nM free Ca2q ., 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 at 248C. Currents were recorded using an EPC-9 amplifier ZHEKA Electronik, Darmstadt, Germany. connected to a PC ZMacintosh Power PC 7100r66. running ``Pulse'' software Zversion 7.85.. Cells were routinely superfused with extracellular solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 at 248C Z2 mlrmin.. Divalent cation-free solution, used for application of agonists, was the same as extracellular solution without added MgCl 2 or CaCl 2 , or with either 1 mM MgCl 2 or 1 mM CaCl 2 as described; ZnCl 2 at 1, 10 or 100 mM was applied in these solutions. Agonists were applied via a U-tube with complete solution exchange

The half-time of desensitization, t 1r2 , represents the time taken for the current to decay to half of its peak value in the continued presence of 5-HT Z30 mM.. Frequently, application of the higher concentrations of Zn2q Z10 and 100 mM. ruptured the seal between micropipette and cell membrane. Consequently, only data where the t 1r2 was measured at all concentrations of Zn2q in the same cell were used for subsequent analysis. All data are shown as arithmetic mean " S.E.M. 2.4. Radioligand binding These were performed as previously described ZLummis et al., 1990, 1993. with minor modifications. Briefly cell membranes were incubated at 08C in HEPES buffer Z10 mM, pH 7.5. in a final volume of 1 ml for 1 h for binding of w3 Hxgranisetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist or 2 h for binding of w3 Hx-meta-chlorophenylbiguanide Zw3 HxmCPBG., a 5-HT3 receptor agonist. Non-specific binding was defined using 100 nM GR67330 Z1,2,3,9-te-tra-hydrowZ5-methyl-1 H-imidazol- 4 - yl.methylx-9 - methyl - 4 H - carazol-4-one.. Incubations were terminated by rapid dilution with ice-cold buffer followed by vacuum filtration onto prewetted GFrB filters with 2 = 2 ml washes using a Brandel cell Harvester. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford Z1976. using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Experimental data were analysed using ``PRISM'' ZGraphPade, San Diego, CA, USA.. 2.5. Drugs and reagents All cell culture reagents were obtained from Gibco BRL ZPaisley, UK., except fetal calf serum which was from Sigma ZPoole, UK.. 5-HT hydrochloride was from Research Biochemicals ZSt. Albans, UK.. w3 HxGranisetron Z81

3. Results 3.1. Effects of di’alent cations The 5-HT3 receptor expressed in HEK 293 cells responded to application of 5-HT in a concentration dependent manner, with an inward current of between 200 pA and 2 nA. The effect of Zn2q on 5-HT-induced responses was differentially modulated in the presence of Ca2q or Mg 2 ; example traces are shown in Fig. 1. Application of 5-HT in the presence of Zn2q Z1≠100 mM. increased the maximal peak current Z Imax . in a concentration dependent manner ZFigs. 2 and 3A.. 1 and 10 mM Zn2q increased the apparent affinity of the 5-HT3 receptor, as measured by EC 50 ZFig. 3B., and also in-

Application of 5-HT in the presence of 1 mM Ca2q or 1 mM Mg 2q reduced Imax and t 1r2 , while the EC 50 remained unaffected; the Hill co-efficient Z n H . was also unchanged ZFig. 3..

3.2. Effects of Zn 2 q in the presence of Ca 2 q or Mg 2 q The enhancement by Zn2q was modified in the presence of Ca2q and Mg 2q ZFig. 1.. To further explore the effects of these ions, functional parameters were investigated. Both Ca2q or Mg 2q reduced Imax by approximately 20% in the absence of Zn2q, but an increase caused by Zn2q was still manifest in the presence of either ion ZFig. 3A., although a higher concentration of Zn2q was required. The same pattern was reflected in the effect of Zn2q on the desensitization rate ZFig. 3B.: both Ca2q and Mg 2q significantly reduced t 1r2 , but the effect of Zn2q to increase t 1r2 was still present, although again there was an apparent rightwards shift of the concentration≠response curve. In contrast, the decrease in EC 50 by 1 and 10 mM Zn2q was abolished in the presence of 1 mM Ca2q or 1 mM Mg 2q ZFig. 3C.. Overall, the effects of Mg 2q tended to be similar to, but less than those of Ca2q, as has been previously reported Ze.g. Peters et al., 1988. suggesting that Mg 2q acts at the same siteZs. as Ca2q, but with a lower efficacy. 3.3. Effects of Zn 2 q on radioligand binding Examination of the effect of Zn2q Z1≠100 mM. on the radioligand binding of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist or agonist revealed no effect on w3 Hxgranisetron binding, but an increase in w3 HxmCBPG binding at both 1 and 10 mM Z13 " 4% and 28 " 7%, respectively, n s 3.. Saturation plots of w3 HxmCBPG binding showed that there was no change in K d in the presence of Zn2q but an increase in the maximum number of w3 HxmCBPG binding sites was observed at both 1 and 10 mM Zn2q ZTable 1.. No change in either parameter was observed at 100 mM Zn2q. 3.4. The permeability of the 5-HT3 receptor ion channel to Zn 2 q To assess the permeability of the ion-channel of the 5-HT3 receptor to Zn2q, the response of a supramaximal concentration of 5-HT Z30 mM. was recorded in the presence of 140 mM Naq Zand no other metal ions. and subsequently in 70 mM Zn2q Zand no other metal ions.. When Zn2q was the only cation available to carry the current, the inward current was either abolished or much reduced, being less than 5% of that when Naq was present ZFig. 4.. This suggests that the 5-HT3 receptor ion channel is probably impermeable to Zn2q.

3.5. There is no ``high affinity'' binding site for Zn 2 q Although all solutions were made up using analytical grade reagents and deionised water, there nevertheless exists the possibility of contamination by low Znanomolar. concentrations of Zn2q andror other heavy metal ions, and such low concentrations of Zn2q have been shown to have effects on the NMDA receptor ZPaoletti et al., 1997.. To assess whether low concentrations of Zn2q had any effects on the 5-HT3 receptor, a maximal concentration Z30 mM. of 5-HT was applied in the presence and absence of 1 mM TPEN Z N, N, N X N X-tetrakis-Z2-pyridylmethyl.-ethylenediamine, a chelator of heavy metal ions. or 100 mM EDTA Zethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid; a chelator of divalent cations. in nominal Ca2qrMg 2q and Zn2q-free extracellular solutions. TPEN had no effect on either peak current or rate of desensitisation ZFig. 5. suggesting there is no high affinity binding site for Zn2q on the 5-HT3 receptor. By contrast, co-application of 100 mM of EDTA caused a marked increase in peak current and t 1r2 , suggesting that sufficient concentrations of divalent cations lingered in the bath to affect both peak current and the rate of desensitization. As TPEN, which binds to a wide range of metal ions Zalthough not to Ca2q and Mg 2q . with much higher affinity than EDTA ZArslan et al., 1985., had no

The peak current in Zn2q only solution is only 4.0% of that obtained in Naq only solution. The long-term change in leak current seen in the second trace is a non-specific effect due the change in wCa2q x o ; untransfected HEK 293 cells showed a similar effect Zdata not shown.. The data are from one cell but are representative of three different cells.

effect, there is a high probability that these `contaminant' divalents are Ca2q and Mg 2q. 3.6. Voltage dependence of Zn 2 q effects To assess the voltage dependence of Zn2q, its affects on Imax and t 1r2 were investigated at different membrane potentials ZFig. 6.. The reversal potential and rectification properties of the 5-HT3 receptor were also unaffected by 1 and 10 mM Zn2q ZFig. 6A., and 1 mM Zn2q had similar effects on Imax and t 1r2 at both positive and negative holding potentials ZFig. 6B and C..

4. Discussion 4.1. Effect of Zn 2 q on 5-HT3 receptor function The action of Zn2q Z1≠10 mM. on recombinant 5-HT3 receptors in the absence of other divalent cations is to potentiate 5-HT induced responses; the potentiation is caused by an increase in maximum current, a decrease in the rate of receptor desensitization and a decrease in the apparent receptor affinity ZEC 50 .. However, at a higher concentration Z100 mM. only one of these effects was manifest, that of enhancing Imax . These data support and extend results obtained in a previous study on recombinant 5-HT3A receptors ZGill et al., 1995., which showed enhancement of current amplitude Z Imax . at low Zn 2q concentrations, although these authors also report inhibition at high Zn2q concentrations. Interestingly, three studies, Lovinger Z1991., Emerit et al. Z1993. and Uki and Narahashi Z1996., which used native 5-HT3 receptors, reported only inhibition of the 5-HT3 receptor-mediated response by Zn2q. The recent identification of the novel 5-HT3B receptor subunit ZDavies et al., 1999. provides a possible explanation for these observations: hetero-oligomeric receptors have different characteristics to homo-oligomeric Z5-HT3A subunit only. receptors ZDavies et al., 1999.; and, although it has not yet been examined, it is a reasonable explanation that the ability of Zn2q to enhance 5-HT3 receptor function may be a property restricted to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors. Other neurotransmitter-gated channels which have enhanced function in the presence of low concentrations of Zn2q are glycine ZBloomenthal et al., 1994; Lynch et al., 1998., a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisovazole-4-propionic acid ZAMPA. ZRassendren et al., 1990. and P2X ZLi et al., 1993; Li et al., 1996. receptors. Although these receptors are all structurally distinct, the modulation of their responses by Zn2q is broadly similar, and resembles the modulation observed in the present study, with low Z0.1≠ 100 mM. Zn2q concentrations enhancing responses, while higher Z0.1≠10 mM. concentrations have no effect or cause inhibition. Some of these authors suggest that these

proteins possess multiple Zn2q binding sites, with either potentiatory or inhibitory properties, and for the glycine receptor at least, there is evidence to support this proposal from kinetic studies ZBloomenthal et al., 1994; Lynch et al., 1998.. The latter authors have also examined the potentiation effects of Zn2q on this receptor in more detail, and they conclude that when Zn2q binds it acts allosterically on the agonist transduction pathway at a site remote from the agonist binding site ZLynch et al., 1998.. Our radiolabeled agonist binding data, which shows an apparent increase in the number of binding sites with no change in binding affinity, would also be consistent with Zn2q causing a structural change in the protein away from the binding site. This change apparently reveals more binding sites; there are potentially five binding sites on the molecule Zonersubunit., but only two or three need be occupied to open the channel Z n H s 2.4., therefore, it is possible that some are unavailable to ligands. A structural change could expose these previously silent sites. The lack of effect observed for w3 Hxantagonist binding may be because the change caused by Zn2q is insufficient without the conformational change to the protein caused by agonist binding. Interestingly, a previous study examining the effect of Zn2q on the binding of w3 HxGR65630 Z3-Z5methyl -1 H-imidazol-4-yl. -1- Z1-methyl-1 H-indol-3-yl. -1propanone., another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, reported an increase in K d but no change in Bmax ZNishio et al., 1994.. It is difficult to reconcile these results with our data, but the differences may have arisen because their experiments were performed on solubilized native Zrat brain. 5-HT3 receptors. Specific amino acid residues that appear to form part of a Zn2q binding site have been identified in several receptors; for example, a histidine residue Z292 or the equivalent 267. that forms part of the pore lining region in the b1 and b3 subunits of GABA A receptors ZWooltorton et al., 1997; Horenstein and Akabas, 1998.. Interestingly, however, a histidine residue located in a different region, the N-terminal domain, appears to be part of the Zn2q binding site in GABA-activated r1 receptor subunit homomers ZWang et al., 1995., suggesting that Zn2q binding sites have evolved at distinct locations even on closely related proteins. It also appears that even small changes in the amino acid sequence of the protein can lead to large changes in Zn2q modulatory effects: in a recent report by Palma et al. Z1998., Zn2q inhibits acetylcholine-induced responses in a7 nACh receptors in a competitive, voltage-independent manner with an IC 50 of approximately 10 mM. However, in the same receptor with a single amino acid change in the channel domain ZL247T., low concentrations of Zn2q ZnM. now potentiate acetylcholine-induced effects, while high concentrations ZmM. inhibit in a voltage-dependent manner. In addition, Zn2q at concentrations as low as 1 pM acts as an agonist. Thus, it appears that the Zn2q binding site is at or near the agonist binding site, one or both of which are presumably structurally modified by the

195

L247T mutation; alternatively more andror perhaps different Zn2q binding sites are revealed by the changed structure. It is therefore not surprising that Zn2q may have quite different modulatory effects at recombinant Z5-HT3A receptor subunits only. and native Zprobably 5-HT3A plus 5-HT3B . receptor subunits. 4.2. Ca 2 q and Mg 2 q attenuate the effect of Zn 2 q The inhibitory effects of Ca2q and Mg 2q on the 5-HT3 receptor are well documented ZPeters et al., 1988, 1993; Yang, 1990; Gill et al., 1995; Brown et al., 1998.. We report similar effects in this study, with Ca2q and Mg 2q causing a decrease in Imax and an increase in the rate of recovery from desensitization, both effects opposite to those observed with Zn2q. The effects of Zn2q, however, were still manifested in the presence of either ion, although there was an apparent shift to the right of the Zn2q concentration≠effect curve. This suggests possible competition of Zn2q, Ca2q and Mg 2q for a common binding site. Brown et al. Z1998., who observed a depression of channel conductance in the presence of divalent ions, propose that there is a binding site for Ca2q and Mg 2q within the channel. As they suggest that divalents bind to this site with higher affinity than monovalent ions, and thereby retard their flux, it is unlikely that this is the site through which Zn2q mediates its enhancing properties; in addition the effects of Zn2q at low concentrations are voltage-independent. However, it is possible that this channel site could be an alternative Zn2q binding site, binding to which then results in inhibition in the same way as Ca2q and Mg 2 . Some support for this hypothesis comes from the studies of Lovinger Z1991. on native 5-HT3 receptors, where the inhibition by Zn2q is voltage-dependent. Ca2q and Mg 2q also attenuate the effect of Zn2q to slow the rate of recovery from desensitization, the former ions again causing an apparent rightward shift of the Zn2q concentration≠effect curve. How binding of divalent ions modulates receptor desensitization is not yet clear; the rate of recovery from desensitization of the 5-HT3 receptor is a complex phenomenon and probably involves the interconversion of many states ZVan Hooft and Vijverberg, 1996.. Several modulators of 5-HT3 receptors, including 5-hydroxyindole ZKooyman et al., 1993., ethanol ZZhou et al., 1998. and intracellular Ca2q ZJones and Yakel, 1998. act by changing the rate of recovery from desensitization but their actual mechanisms andror binding sites are poorly understood. Nevertheless, the rate of desensitization may be an important parameter in the regulation of 5-HT3mediated responses in vivo. 4.3. Permeability of the 5-HT3 receptor to Zn 2 q ions The 5-HT3 receptor is a non-selective cation channel ZJackson and Yakel, 1995. and, in vivo, the bulk of the

5-HT3 receptor-mediated current is likely to be carried by Naq ions. Nevertheless, it also has some permeability to divalent cations ZHargreaves et al., 1994. and recent reports suggest structural variants which may be highly permeable to Ca2q ZRonde and Nichols, 1998; Van Hooft ¥ et al., 1998.. In view of this, we tested the permeability of the 5-HT3 receptor to Zn2q ions by massively increasing the external concentration of Zn2q to 70 mM, and removing all other metallic cations from the solution. Despite problems caused by Zn2q ions breaking the seal between cell membrane and micropipette, our data suggest that the amplitude of current carried by Zn2q in the absence of other metal ions was less than 5% of the magnitude of the current carried by Naq ZFig. 4.. Thus, Zn2q entry into the cell via the 5-HT3 receptor is likely to be negligible.

4.4. Conclusions We conclude that Zn2q at low concentrations Z1≠100 mM. can modify the responses of 5-HT3 receptors, in both the presence and absence of physiological concentrations of Ca2q and Mg 2q. These concentrations of Zn2q are probably sufficient to modify 5-HT3 receptor responses in vivo: estimates vary between the background concentration of 0.1≠0.2 mM within the cerebro spinal fluid ZCSF. ZPalm et al., 1983. to possibly over 200 mM within the synapse ZFrederickson et al., 1983., and Zn2q has been shown to be present in nerve terminals and can be released upon stimulation ZAssaf and Chung, 1984; Howell et al., 1984.. The bimodal nature of Zn2q effects suggests that there is more than one Zn2q binding site, and the fact that Zn2q effects can be modulated by Ca2q and Mg 2q suggests one or more of the Zn2q binding sites may be common to all three cations. As there is little or no Zn2q entry through the 5-HT3 receptor channel, the Zn2q binding sites are unlikely to be intracellular. Combining our data with previous work, we propose that the site that modulates enhancement resides in the N-terminal extracellular domain, while the site that results in inhibition may be located in or close to the channel. The recent identification of Zn2q binding sites on GABA ZWang et al., 1995; Wooltorton et al., 1997; Horenstein and Akabas, 1998. and NMDA receptors ZChoi and Lipton, 1999. suggests that, in future, it should be possible to clarify the position of these sites in more detail.
