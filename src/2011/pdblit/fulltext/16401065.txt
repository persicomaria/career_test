ABSTRACT: An X-ray diffraction study to 2.0 Å resolution shows that this enzyme, ATCase, is in the T-state (the c3 to c3 distance is 45.2 Å) when ATCase is bound to carbamyl phosphate (CP) and to L-alanosine (an analogue of aspartate). This result strongly supports the kinetic results that alanosine did not inhibit the carbamylation of aspartate in the normal reaction of native ATCase plus CP and aspartate [Baillon, J., Tauc, P., and Herve, G. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 7182-7187]. The structure further reveals ´ that the phosphate of CP is 4 Å away from its known position in the R-state and is in the T-state position of Pi in a recent study of ATCase complexed with products, phosphate (Pi) and N-carbamyl-L-aspartate [Huang, J., and Lipscomb, W. N. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 6422-6426]. Moreover, the alanosine position in this T-state is somewhat displaced from that expected for its analogue, aspartate, from the R-state position. The relations of these structural aspects to the kinetics are presented.

Aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase)1 from Escherichia coli (EC 2.1.3.2) catalyzed the reaction of L-aspartate with carbamyl phosphate to form carbamylaspartate and phosphate and initiates the pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis. The holoenzyme of ATCase is composed of two catalytic trimers (2c3, 102 kDa each) and three regulatory dimers (3r2, 34 kDa each). The levels of intracellular pools of aspartate are estimated to be between 2 and 5 mM (1). The pH dependence of this catalyzed reaction varies with the concentration of L-aspartate (2-7): in the presence of low concentrations (e5 mM) of L-aspartate, ATCase is essentially all in the T form (low affinity and low activity) and its optimum pH is 6.8, whereas in the presence of high concentrations of L-aspartate, ATCase is in the R form (high affinity and high activity) and its optimum pH is 8.2. A similar T-state reaction, which was catalyzed by ATCase, was also observed from the reverse reaction (8) under conditions in which the aspartate is rapidly removed by other enzymes, as well as from the reactions of carbamyl phosphate with L-aspartate analogues including cysteinesulfinate (9) or L-alanosine (10). When L-alanosine, an anticancer drug originally isolated from

Streptomyces alanosinicus (11), was used as a substrate instead of L-aspartate, it has been reported that only a minor variation of pH dependence was observed (10): when the concentration for L-alanosine rose from 2 to 100 mM, the optimum pH remained between 6.8 and 7.0, and the saturation curve for L-alanosine did not exhibit homotropic cooperative interactions between the catalytic sites. The results have indicated that L-alanosine, for which Km was estimated as higher than 1 M, reacted with carbamyl phosphate at an extremely low rate [V ) 0.28 nmol min-1 (g of protein)-1; carbamylalanosine was identified by chromatography (10) with a migration Rf value of 0.43] and was unable to promote the allosteric transition of ATCase (10). In the present study, the structure of ATCase complexed with carbamyl phosphate and L-alanosine is presented in order to compare the T-state ATCase complexes previously described with other ligands. Special attention is given to analogues of the physiological substrates, carbamyl phosphate and aspartate. MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystal Growth. The holoenzyme of E. coli aspartate transcarbamoylase was isolated by the method of Nowlan and Kantrowitz (12) from E. coli strain EK1104 containing the plasmid pEK54 (13). Carbamyl phosphate was purchased from the Sigma Chemical Co. The L-alanosine was a generous gift from Drs. D. Cooney, R. R. Davis, and V. Narayanan, Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Programs, Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI, Bethesda, MD. The crystals used in this study were grown at room temperature in the presence of 1 mM carbamyl phosphate and 1 mM L-alanosine by the hanging

drop method, where 2 µL of enzyme (16 mg/mL) in buffer (40 mM KH2PO4/0.2 mM EDTA/2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) was mixed with 2 µL of 12% (v/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 4000 (PEG-4K)/0.1 M Hepes-Na (pH 7.5)/4% (v/v) 2-propanol/3 mM NaN3 and equilibrated against 1 mL of 14% PEG-4K/0.1 M Hepes-Na (pH 7.5)/4% (v/v) 2-propanol/3 mM NaN3. Two days later, the crystals were frozen and stored under liquid nitrogen before the data collection. The decomposition of carbamyl phosphate has been measured in the crystallization buffer by 31P NMR at room temperature. The result shows that the initial half-life of carbamyl phosphate is about 11 h, which is consistent with the previous experiment (14), and there is still about 25% of original carbamyl phosphate left after 3 days of the decomposition (Figure 1). This residual carbamyl phosphate is in equilibrium with phosphate and cyanate (15-16) under our crystallization buffer, and the result is close to the report of Halmann et al. (17). Successful cocrystallizations of carbamyl phosphate with ATCase (14) and OTCase (18) have been reported. Data Collection and Analysis. The diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline F-1 of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). Crystals of the ATCase complexed with carbamyl phosphate plus L-alanosine are in the space group R3 and have unit cell dimensions of a ) b ) 129.2 Å, c ) 198.1 Å, and  ) 120°. Diffraction data were collected to 2.0 Å, yielding an Rmerge of 0.066 for 130959 measured reflections of 74502 unique reflections. The reduced data set was 89.5% complete in the resolution range 2.0-30 Å (Table 1). A search model, which contains one catalytic chain and one regulatory chain (one-half of the asymmetric unit), was taken from PDB code 1D09 (19). Molecular replacement was carried out by AMoRe (20). A model of carbamyl phosphate (CP) was taken from PDB code 1C9Y (21), and the atomic coordinate of L-alanosine (ALS) was taken from the crystal structure of L-alanosine (22). Then, CP and ALS (Figure 2) were built into the simulated annealing omit map. The refinement was performed by using the CNS_SOLVE package (23). The model was visualized and modified against 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps using the program O (24). The stereochemical properties of the intermediate and the final structures were examined by PROCHECK (25). Final refinement yielded R ) 0.239, Rfree ) 0.273 for all diffraction data and R ) 0.207, Rfree ) 0.249 for only 4 cutoff data, and the Luzzati coordinate error of the final model is 0.25 Å. A total of 606 water molecules were found in one asymmetric unit. The protein-protein interface interactions were calculated by Protein-Protein Interaction Server (26)

Huang and Lipscomb transition from the T-state to the R-state (Table 2), these small differences support the assignment as the T form. The T-state conformation is also indicated by the existence of the interactions Ser131-Asp236, Lys164-Glu239, and Tyr165-Glu239, which are conserved between two adjacent catalytic chains of two catalytic trimers in most T forms of ATCase. These bonds become broken when the enzyme conformation changes from the T-state to the R-state (31). ActiVe Sites of Carbamyl Phosphate and L-Alanosine. In each asymmetric unit of the new structure, there are two catalytic chains (indicated by chains A and G) and two regulatory chains (B and H). Each catalytic chain is ligated to one molecule of carbamyl phosphate (CP) and one molecule of L-alanosine (ALS). The two carbamyl phosphate molecules in one asymmetric unit are similar, as are the two L-alanosine molecules. The rms distance of CR between chain A and chain G is 0.315 Å, and the rms distance of CR between chain B and chain H is 0.762 Å. In this T-state structure, the side chains of Arg54, Arg105, and His134 interact with the phosphate oxygens of carbamyl phosphate, and the side chains of Arg105 and His134 contact the carbamyl group of carbamyl phosphate. The side chain of Gln137 has a interaction with carbamyl phosphate in chain A as shown in Figure 3a, and the side chains of Thr55 and Arg229 are involved in the phosphate region of the carbamyl phosphate binding site in chain G as shown in Figure 3b. Residues Thr53 and Arg53 interact with the N-nitroso-Nhydroxyamino group of L-alanosine, and residues Ala51 and Arg105 are in contact with the carboxyl group of L-alanosine. Residues Ser52 and *Ser80 from the adjacent catalytic chain (designated by the asterisk) are involved in the L-alanosine binding site in chain A (Figure 3a), and residues Glu50 and Thr55 are in close contact with L-alanosine in chain G (Figure 3b).

a The c3,,,c3 distance of the unligated T-state ATCase (6AT1) is 45.3 Å. ATCase-CP-alanosine is a new structure of ATCase bound to CP and alanosine (2AIR). ATCase-PALA is the structure of ATCase bound to PALA (1D09). X-planar angles between domains define the hinge angle between domains (19, 28); the minus means more closed and the plus means more open.

carbamyl phosphate plus L-alanosine is in the T-state; the catalytic trimer c3,,,c3 distance is 45.2 Å, in excellent agreement with that in the unligated T-state of ATCase (45.3 Å; PDB code 6AT1) (30). The c3,,,c3 distance is 56.1 Å in the R-state ATCase with its substrate analogue complexes (19). The global conformational differences between the new structure and the unligated T-state of ATCase (PDB code 6AT1) are indicated by the small relative rotation of the chains and the relative movements of domains, as follows. The c3 to c3 relative rotation around the 3-fold axis of trimers is about 2.0°, and the relative rotation of each regulatory chain around the pseudo-2-fold axis of regulatory dimers is about 1.9°; the X-planar angles between the Asp and CP domains are more open by 1.2°; the X-planar angles are only about 0.5° more open between the ZN and AL domains, and they are more closed by 0.6° between CP and ZN domains and more closed by 3.4° between the two AL domains. Compared to the big global conformational change by the

DISCUSSION T-State Binding Mode of Carbamyl Phosphate. The structures of ATCase ligated with N-phosphonacetyl-Laspartate (PALA) (19) or carbamyl phosphate plus succinate (14) indicate the binding mode of carbamyl phosphate in the R-state. The binding of only carbamyl phosphate induces little conformation change of ATCase (32-34), which maintains the conformation of the enzyme in the T-state of the unligated enzyme. Thus ATCase undergoes a big conformational change only after the addition of the second substrate, L-aspartate. Is the binding mode of carbamyl phosphate in the T-state the same as that in the R-state? The answer is no. This new structure shows that the phosphate part of carbamyl phosphate has a similar binding mode with the phosphate (Figure 4) in ATCase complexed with carbamylaspartate plus phosphate (35). This phosphate site is about 4 Å away from that found in transition state analogues [PALA (19) or carbamyl phosphate plus succinate (14)]. The two phosphate sites 4 Å apart were previously identified in the complex of ATCase with pyrophosphate (36) or with phosphate at partial occupancy (36). The structure presented here indicates that carbamyl phosphate binds to the T-state ATCase in a different mode compared to the binding of carbamyl phosphate to the R-state. Therefore, a 4 Å movement of the phosphate of carbamyl phosphate occurs during the T to R transition as L-aspartate binds to ATCase. Further support for this binding mode of CP in the T-state of ATCase will need more T-state structures of ATCase bound to CP or its analogues along with aspartate or its analogues. Different Binding Mode between L-Alanosine and LAspartate in ATCase Complexed with Carbamyl Phosphate. L-Alanosine acts as a pseudosubstrate for a number of L-aspartate-utilizing enzymes such as ATCase (37, 38), L-aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (39), L-aspartate aminotransferase (39), and the L-aspartate transport system (39). In the interaction of L-alanosine with L-aspartate binding enzymes, it is usually suggested that L-alanosine and L-aspartate share a common binding site and thus possess common structural and chemical features. Surprisingly, this new structure shows that the binding mode of L-alanosine in the T-state (plus CP) is different from that of L-aspartate in the R-state (plus CP). Instead, L-alanosine occupies a position (Figure 4) which

will be occupied by some part of product, carbamylaspartate. This unexpected binding mode of L-alanosine in the T form ATCase implies that L-alanosine acts somewhat like the product and its release will be easy like the product. In addition, aspartate (Km ) 11.8) (40) has higher affinity to ATCase than does L-alanosine (Km > 1 M) (10). Thus, L-alanosine does not fully inhibit the binding of L-aspartate to native ATCase. This structural result is consistent with the early experimental result (10) that L-alanosine does not inhibit the carbamylation of L-aspartate in native ATCase at the same range of concentrations as in the case of the catalytic subunits. The fact (10) that L-alanosine did inhibit carbamylation of L-aspartate by the isolated catalytic subunit of E. coli ATCase can be reasonable if inhibition by L-alanosine is partly similar to product inhibition, which itself has been observed by Porter et al. (32) in kinetic studies of the ATCase catalytic subunit c3. When the concentration for L-alanosine was varied from 2 to 100 mM, the optimum pH remained between 6.8 and 7.0 (10). Moreover, the saturation curve (10) of ATCase holoenzyme for L-alanosine shows a lack of homotropic cooperative interactions between the catalytic sites for the utilization of L-alanosine. Finally, similar T-state noncooperativity occurs in the reverse reaction study using products: carbamylaspartate and phosphate (8). Therefore, the binding mode of L-alanosine not only indicates that L-alanosine has a similar binding mode to that of some part of carbamylaspartate but also suggests that L-alanosine might behave at least partly like carbamylaspartate. The result that the binding mode of L-alanosine in this new structure is somewhat different from that of L-aspartate suggests that L-alanosine might behave differently from L-aspartate as substrate for other L-aspartate-utilizing enzymes (39). Orientation of Some Interesting Residues. Four residues, Arg54, Arg105, Arg167, and Arg229, which were previously identified as interacting with the bisubstrate analogue PALA (19, 41, 42), have been mutated by site-specific mutagenesis. Each of these mutants (40, 43, 44) showed approximately 900-fold or more reductions in the maximal observed specific activity and thus indicated that these four residues were critical for catalysis by ATCase.

350 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 2, 2006 Comparison of these four residues in the new structure and in other T- or R-state ATCase structures shows the following. (a) The main chain of Arg54 moves slightly, and its backbone carbonyl oxygen is in contact with the hydroxyl group of *Tyr98 from the adjacent catalytic chain. This interaction between Arg54 (O) and *Tyr98 (OH) was also observed in the complex of the R-state, ATCase-PALA (19). The side chain of Arg54 interacts with Pro266, which is located in the 270s' loop (residues 265- 275). The interactions between some 270s'loop residues, Leu267 and Pro268, with Arg54 have been characterized in the unligated T-state ATCase (30). The interaction of Arg54 with the side chain of Gln137 is observed in the new structure. (b) The side chain of Arg229 interacts with Pro268 (270s' loop) and *Lys83 (80s' loop, residues 76-85) from the adjacent catalytic chain. The interactions between Arg229 and the 270s' loop residues, Val270, Asp271, and Glu272, were observed in the complex of R-state ATCase-PALA or T-state ATCase-CLA-Pi (35). The interaction between Arg229 and *Lys84, another residue in the 80s' loop from the adjacent catalytic chain, was observed in the complex of R-state ATCase-PALA. (c) The side chain of Arg167 interacts with Ser130 and His170. Both interactions were observed in the unligated T-state ATCase. In the new structure, the side chain of Arg167 interacts with Tyr197, which was also observed to contact with Arg167 in the T-state ATCase-AP-Asp; there is no interaction between Arg167 and either Glu50 or Arg234, both of which were observed in R-state ATCasePALA. (d) Residue Arg105 interacts with some 50s' loop (residues 47-53) residues (Cys47, Phe49, Glu50, Ala51, and Ser52) and Ala127. All of these interactions were observed in the unligated T-state ATCase or in the R-state ATCase-PALA. The two interactions (Arg105-His134 and Arg105Arg167), which were observed in both the unligated T-state ATCase or R-state ATCase-PALA, were not present in the new structure. It is clear that residues Arg54, Arg105, Arg167, and Arg229 must reorientate when substrates or their analogues bind to ATCase whether the enzyme is in the T-state or the R-state. Residues Arg105, Arg167, and Arg229 have been considered to model the substrate binding site in T-state ATCase (45). It has been indicated the Arg54 is essential for catalysis (40). When Arg54 was replaced by Ala (40), the holoenzyme and catalytic trimer subunit exhibited approximately 17000-fold and 70000-fold reductions in maximal activity, respectively. Catalytic Mechanism for the Reaction of Carbamyl Phosphate with L-Alanosine. Although the binding modes of carbamyl phosphate and L-alanosine in this new structure are quite different from those of the corresponding parts in PALA (19) or carbamyl phosphate plus succinate (14) or phosphonoacetamide plus malonate (46), residues Arg105 and His134 still interact with the carbonyl oxygen of carbamyl phosphate. The distances between the phosphate oxygen (O3P, Figure 5) of carbamyl phosphate and the amino nitrogen of L-alanosine are about 2.99 and 2.50 Å, respectively, in both active sites in one crystallographic asymmetric unit. In addition, the distances between the carbamyl carbon of carbamyl phosphate and the amino nitrogen of L-alanosine

are about 4.76 and 4.12 Å, respectively, in both active sites in one asymmetric unit. It is possible to suggest a mechanism (Figure 5), which is similar to the mechanism previous proposed for the reaction of CP and aspartate (19). The polarization of the carbonyl oxygen of carbamyl phosphate by His134 and Arg105 helps to form the tetrahedral intermediate (41, 47). Then the removal of the proton from the NH2 group of L-alanosine is accomplished by the leaving monophosphate dianion from carbamyl phosphate. Summary. (1) The geometrical structure of ATCase bound to CP and L-alanosine is the T-state, not some intermediate state between T and R. The trimer c3,,,c3 distance is 45.2 Å. (2) The phosphate of CP in the ATCase-CP-ALS complex is 4 Å away from the position expected in the physiological ATCase-CP-Asp complex. This displacement was previously seen in ATCase bound to either pyrophosphate alone or phosphate alone. (3) The L-alanosine binding mode is different from that of aspartate in the ATCase-CP-Asp complex and consistent with the kinetic result that alanosine did not inhibit the carbamylation of aspartate in the normal reaction of native ATCase plus carbamyl phosphate and aspartate. Instead, this normal reaction of native ATCase (c6r6 but not c3) was moderately activated by alanosine (10). (4) The anomaly (relative to aspartate) found in this X-ray diffraction study is the progressive binding of alanosine to the catalytic sites. This was suggested by both the mild stimulatory effect on the normal ATCase reaction (3) and the change in pH dependence of the alanosine reaction as its concentration is raised from 2 to 100 mM. This observation may be coupled with the high dissociation constant for alanosine (10) following the general coupling of reactions noted (10) by G. Weber (48, 49). Further structural studies are thus indicated at various concentrations and pH values. (5) The stimulation by PALA and the response to allosteric effectors of this T-state reaction are similar to those effects for other T-state reactions including the aspartate analogue, L-cysteinesulfinate (9), and the reverse reaction (8) of normal substrates under condition of rapid removal of one of the products: aspartate.
