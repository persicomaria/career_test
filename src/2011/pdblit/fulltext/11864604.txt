Abstract Relatives of the vertebrate estrogen receptor (ER) are found in Aplysia californica, Octopus vulgaris, Thais clavigera, and Marisa cornuarietis. Unlike vertebrate ERs, invertebrate ERs are constitutively active and do not bind estradiol. To investigate the molecular basis of the absence of estrogen binding, we constructed a 3D model of the putative steroid-binding domain on octopus ER. Our 3D model indicates that binding of estradiol to octopus ER is prevented by steric clashes between estradiol and amino acids in the steroid-binding pocket. In this respect, octopus ER resembles vertebrate estrogen-related receptors (ERR), which have a ligand-binding pocket that cannot accommodate estradiol. Like ERR, octopus ER also may have the activation function 2 domain (AF2) in a configuration that can bind to coactivators in the absence of estrogens, which would explain constitutive activity of octopus ER.

The physiological actions of estradiol are mediated by binding to the estrogen receptor, which belongs to the nuclear receptor family, a large and diverse family of transcription factors [1­5]. Other steroid receptors in this family include the androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and progesterone receptor (PR) [5­7]. Substantial progress in understanding the evolution of steroid receptors has come from deciphering their sequences in mammals, amphibians, and fish [1­4]. An important advance was the cloning of the ER, corticoid receptor (CR), and PR from lamprey, a jawless fish at the base of the vertebrate line [3]. Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate steroid receptors shows that the ER is separate from the AR, PR, GR, and MR [2,3,5­8]. Another importance advance was the sequencing of invertebrate ERs from Aplysia californica [9], Octopus

vulgaris [10], and two snails: Thais clavigera [11] and Marisa cornuarietis [12], and oyster [13]. These invertebrate ERs have less than 40% sequence identity in the segment that aligns with the estrogen-binding domain in human ERa. Interestingly, invertebrate ERs are constitutively active; they do not bind estradiol with high affinity, in contrast to vertebrate ERs, which are activated by 0.2 nM estradiol [14]. In this respect, invertebrate ERs resemble the ERR, which as its name implies has significant sequence similarity to vertebrate ERs [1,3,5,7,15] as well as to invertebrate ERs [9­11]. Like invertebrate ERs, ERRs are constitutively active and do not have high affinity for estradiol [15­17]. To investigate the basis for the poor binding of estradiol to invertebrate ERs, we constructed a 3D model of the segment on octopus ER that corresponds to the steroid-binding domain on human ERa. Comparative analysis of octopus ER with human ERa [18] reveals steric clashes between estradiol and amino acids in the steroid-binding pocket of octopus ER. This would explain the lack of estrogen binding by octopus ER. In this respect, octopus ER resembles ERR1 and ERR3, which also have steric

clashes between estradiol and amino acids in their steroidbinding pockets [16,17]. ERR1 and ERR3 cocrystalized with coactivator peptides have their AF2 domain in a configuration that binds coactivators. Octopus ER also may have the AF2 domain in a configuration that can bind to coactivators, which would explain constitutive activity of octopus ER. Methods
Construction of 3D models. To get a robust analysis of the interaction of octopus ER with estradiol, we constructed 3D models of octopus ER using human ERa [PDB ID: 1G50] and ERR3 [PDB ID: 1TFC] separately as templates. ERR1 [PDB ID: 1XB7] was not used because some sequence did not diffract sufficiently for inclusion in the crystal structure. Human ERa was used as a template for construction of the 3D model of octopus ER1; human ERR3 was used for construction of the 3D model of octopus ER2. The Alignment option in Insight II was used to construct separate pairwise alignments of octopus ER with ERa and ERR3, which were saved as PIR files. The alignment for octopus ER with each template is shown in Fig. 1. PIR files for each octopus ER were converted to PDB files by Modeller [19]. To insert estradiol into the octopus ER1 and ER2 models, we used the Superimpose option in Insight II to overlap ER1 and ER2 with human ERa, which contains estradiol. Then estradiol was extracted from human ERa and inserted into octopus ER1 and ER2. A similar procedure was used to insert estradiol into human ERR3. Discover 3 in Insight II refined the structure of each octopus ER with estradiol. For this energy minimization step, Discover 3 was run for 10,000 iterations, using a distant dependent dielectric constant of 2.

Results Fig. 1 reveals few gaps or insertions in the alignment of octopus ER with human ERa, ERR1, and ERR3. This

bodes well for construction of useful 3D models of octopus ER using human ERa and human ERR3 templates. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2, global ribbon representations of 3D models of octopus ER1 and ER2 constructed by Modeller overlap nicely with the two template structures, human ERa and ERR3. Good global alignment of 3D model of octopus ER with human ERa does not mean that all interactions between estradiol and octopus ER1 and ER2 are favorable. Thus, we studied specific interactions of estradiol with octopus ER1 and ER2 under two different conditions as described in Methods. First, we analyzed estradiol that was inserted into the un-minimized 3D models of octopus ER1 and ER2, as prepared by Modeller. This approach is conceptually similar to that used for analysis of the interaction of estradiol with ERR3, in which estradiol was inserted into the crystal structure of ERR3 and analyzed without further minimization of the estradiol/ERR3 complex. In the second approach, the estradiol/octopus ER complexes were minimized Discover 3 to investigate whether estradiol and octopus ER could relax into a conformation with favorable interactions. For clarity, we present the analysis of estradiol in octopus ER in two sections. In the first part, we describe the interaction of estradiol with Arg-328, Asp-287, Phe-339, and Tyr447 on octopus ER. The corresponding residues in human ERa are Arg-394, Glu-353, and Phe-404, which stabilize the A ring, and His-524, which stabilizes the D ring of estradiol [18,20] (Fig. 3A). We chose Arg-394, Glu-353, and Phe-404 because they are functionally and evolutionarily important as seen in their conservation in

Fig. 2. Overlap of 3D models of octopus ER with human ERa and human ERR3. The un-minimized model of octopus ER was superimposed on human ERa and human ERR3. There is excellent overlap for both. The root mean square deviation between the Ca backbone of the templates and octopus ER1 and ER2 is 1.63A and 0.41A, respectively.

the PR [21], GR [22], AR [23], and MR [24­26], which contain corresponding arginine and phenylalanine residues, and a glutamine, instead of a glutamic acid. The glutamine has a hydrogen bond with the C3-ketone on their cognate steroids. It appears that the Arg, Glu/Gln, Phe triad are a highly conserved structure for stabilizing the binding of the A ring of steroids to their receptors. In the second part, we describe some of the residues on octopus ER that have steric clashes with estradiol, which would prevent steroid binding. In human ERa, the corresponding residues stabilize binding of estradiol.

Interaction of the A ring on estradiol with ERa, ERR3, and un-minimized octopus ER Fig. 3A shows the interaction of the A and D rings of estradiol with ERa. Oe2 on Glu-353 and Ng2 on Arg394 have hydrogen bonds with the phenolic hydroxyl on estradiol. The position of the side chain on Arg-394 is stabilized further through a hydrogen bond between Ne and the carboxylate on Phe-404. Ce2 on Phe-404 also has a stabilizing van der Waals contact with C10 on estradiol.

In ERR3, Ng2 on Arg-316 and Oe2 on Glu-275 are ° ° 3.7 A and 3.5A, respectively, from the C3-phenolic group (Fig. 3A). This is too distant for a strong hydrogen bond. In ERR3, phenylalanine is replaced with ° tyrosine, in which Ce1 is 3.4A from C10 on estradiol (Fig. 3A). Examination of the un-minimized 3D model of octopus ER1 (Fig. 3B) finds a stabilizing hydrogen bond between ° Ng2 on Arg-328 and estradiol, which are 2.6A apart. There is also a weak hydrogen bond between the carboxylate on ° Phe-339 and Ne on Arg-328, which are 3.1A apart. However, ° from C10 on estradiol, which is an Ce2 on Phe-339 is 3.1A unfavorable van der Waals contact. As mentioned above, octopus ER has an Asp-287 instead of Glu-353 on ERa. Conservation of this negative charge raises the possibility of a stabilizing interaction between Asp-287 and the C3-phenolic group. However, in octopus ER1, Od2 on Asp-287 and ° the C3-hydroxyl on estradiol are 5A apart, which is too distant for a hydrogen bond. Examination of the un-minimized octopus ER2 model finds a hydrogen bond between Ng2 on Arg-328 and ° the C3-phenolic group, which are 2.5A apart. The carboxylate on Phe-339 is 3.2 from Ne on Arg-328, which ° is a weak hydrogen bond. Also, Ce2 on Phe-339 is 2.5A from C10 on estradiol, which is an unfavorable van der ° Waals contact. Asp-287 is 3.3A from the C3-phenolic group. Interaction of the D ring on estradiol with ERa, ERR3, and octopus ER In human ERa, Nd1 on His-524 has a hydrogen bond with the C17 alcohol on the D ring of estradiol. This histi° dine is conserved in ERR3 (Fig. 3A), although it is 3.5A from the C17 alcohol, which is too distant for a strong hydrogen bond. Tyrosine-447 in octopus ER corresponds to His-434 in ° ERa. In octopus ER1 and ER2, Cd2 on Tyr-447 is 2.8A ° and 5.9A, respectively, from the C17 alcohol. Estradiol has steric clashes with amino acids in octopus ER1 and ER2 In Fig. 4, we compare residues on human ERa, which stabilize the binding of estradiol, with selected corresponding residues in octopus ER1, ER2, and ERR3. As shown in Fig. 4, Leu-525, Leu-387, Met-388, and Met421 on ERa have favorable van der Waals contacts with estradiol [18,20]. ° As shown in Fig. 4A, Phe-435 on ERR3, is 0.4A from C15 on estradiol. Phe-435 was found to have a critical steric clash with estradiol [17]. Phe-435 and Leu-345, in which ° Cd2 is 2.7A from C15 on estradiol, were shown to be prevent binding of estradiol to ERR3. Fig. 4B shows several unfavorable van der Waals contacts between estradiol and octopus ER1 and ER2. Cd2 ° ° on Leu-322 in octopus ER1 and ER2 is 2.1A and 2.6A,

respectively, from C6 on estradiol. Cc2 and Cc1 on Val° ° 321 in ER1 and ER2, respectively, are 2.8A and 2.4A, respectively, from C3 on estradiol. Fig. 4B reveals an interesting difference in the interaction of Leu-448 in ER1 and ER2 with estradiol. In ER1, Leu-448, which corresponds to Leu-525 in ERa ° and Phe-435 in ERR3, is 4A from the C18. In octopus ° from C16, which is a major ER2, Leu-448 is only 1A steric clash. This difference may be because octopus ER1 was modeled on a human ERa template, in which ° Leu-425 is 3.9A from C18, while ER2 was modeled on ° a human ERR3 template, in which Phe-435 is 0.4A from C16. ° ° Ce of Met-355 in ER1 and ER2 is 3.6A and 3.8A, respectively, from C16, which are favorable van der Waals contacts. We also studied the interaction with estradiol of Ile358 on octopus ER because Ile-358 corresponds to Leu-345 on ERR3, in which Leu-345 has a steric clash with estradiol (Fig. 4). It is interesting that Ile-358 does not have a steric clash with estradiol in ER1, ER2 or ERa (Fig. 4B). Interaction of estradiol with octopus ER1 and ER2 after energy minimization We investigated whether energy minimization of octopus ER1 and ER2 complexed with estradiol would remove unfavorable interactions between estradiol and octopus ER. Figs 3C and 4C show that energy minimization alters the distances between estradiol and amino acid side chains on octopus ER1 and ER2. These figures show that there are both favorable and unfavorable changes in the distance between estradiol and octopus ER1 and ER2. Interaction of the A and D ring on estradiol with energymimimized octopus ER A favorable change upon energy minimization by Discover 3 was the movement of Asp-287 on octopus ER1 towards the C3-phenolic group. In the minimized 3D ° model of octopus ER1, Od2 on Asp-287 moves to 2.7A from the C3-phenolic group (Fig. 3C). ° Fig. 3C also shows that Ce2 on Phe-339 is 1.4A from C2 on estradiol, which is a very unfavorable van der Waals ° contact. Cd2 on Tyr-447 has moved to 4A from the C17 hydroxyl. ° In octopus ER2, Ng2 moved to 3.8A from the C3-phenolic group, which is too distant for a hydrogen ° bond. Moreover, Ne is 5A from the carboxylate of ° Phe-339. Interestingly, Cd1 on Phe-339 in 2.9A from ° distance between Ce1 and C10, in contrast to the 2.5A C10 in the un-minimized ER2. During minimization there was a rotation of the side chain in Phe-339. There is also a rotation in the side chain of Tyr-447. In the minimized ° ER2, Cd2 is 5.4A from the C17 hydroxyl.

Steric clashes between estradiol and amino acids in energyminimized octopus ER ° Fig. 4C shows that in ER1, Cd2 on Leu-448 is 2.1A from ° C18, while, in ER2, Cd1 on Leu-448 is 1.6A from C18. Thus, after minimization, in both octopus ER1 and ER2, Leu-448 has unfavorable van der Waals contacts with estradiol. In ER1, Cc2 on Val-321 and Cd2 on Leu-322 still have unfavorable van der Waals contacts with estradiol, as does Cc1 on Val-321 and Cd2 on Leu-322 in ER2. In ER1, ° Ce on Met-355 is 4.1A from C16. In ER2, Ce on Met-355 is 1.3A from C17. Also, Ile-358 does not have a steric clash with estradiol (Fig. 4C). Discussion The discovery of invertebrate ERs was an exciting and important advance for understanding the origins of estrogen signaling. A puzzling property of invertebrate ERs, which distinguishes them from vertebrate ERs, is that invertebrate ERs are transcriptionally active in the absence of estradiol. Moreover, invertebrate ERs do not bind estradiol [9­11]. These properties of invertebrate ERs are similar to that of human ERR1 and ERR3, which also are transcriptionally active in the absence of estradiol and do not bind estradiol [15­17,27].

Comparisons of the 3D structures of ERa, ERR1, and ERR3 indicate that their overall 3D structures are conserved [16,17]. This indicates that specific clashes between estradiol and side chains on ERRs are responsible for the absence of hormone binding. Indeed, analysis of the ligand-binding pockets on ERR1 and ERR3 found that several amino acids on ERR1 and ERR3 would interfere with binding of estradiol [16,17]. Our 3D models of octopus ER also show good overall conservation of structure with ERa and ERR3 (Fig. 2). As seen in Figs. 3 and 4, there are steric clashes between estradiol and octopus ER1 and ER2. Moreover, Arg-328, Phe339, Asp-287, and Tyr-447, which correspond to residues that are important in stabilizing estradiol in human ERa, are not in a similar conformation for stabilizing estradiol in octopus ER1 and ER2. Our analyses are independent of the template that we used; that is, both the ERa and ERR3 templates yielded models of octopus ER1 and ER2 that have unfavorable interactions with estradiol. Moreover, while energy minimization moved the Asp-287 to have a hydrogen bond with the C3-phenolic group on estradiol, other residues moved to have unfavorable van der Waals contacts. Thus, it appears that during minimization by Discover 3, constraints for maintaining favorable structures in other parts of octopus ER lead to unfavorable changes in the distance between estradiol and side chains in the steroid-binding pocket.

Constitutive activity of octopus ER Constitutive activity of ERR and invertebrate ERs requires that the AF2 domain have a configuration that can interact productively with coactivators [28,29]. Indeed, an important outcome of the binding of estradiol to vertebrate ERs is to induce a conformational change in the AF2 domain, which renders the ER transcriptionally active. A similar mechanism for activating the AF2 domain occurs upon binding of hormones to other steroid receptors and ligand-activated nuclear receptors [28,29]. The 3D structures of ERR1 and ERR3 co-crystallized with coactivator peptides reveal that the AF2 domain is in a position to have productive interactions with coactivators and regulate gene transcription. A similar transcriptionally active configuration would explain the constitutive properties of invertebrate ERs. Evolutionary implications ERRs are among the most ancient nuclear receptors [5]. Both invertebrates and invertebrates contain ERRs. In addition to the sequence similarity between ERRs and invertebrate ERs, both are constitutively active and do not bind estrogens. A parsimonious explanation for these similarities between ERRs and invertebrate ERs is that their common ancestor was constitutively active and did not bind estrogens. This model supports the hypothesis that ligand binding was acquired during the evolution of nuclear receptors [1,30]. References
