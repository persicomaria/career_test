Gram-negative bacteria use type II secretion systems for the transport of virulence factors and hydrolytic enzymes through the outer membrane. These sophisticated multi-protein complexes reach from the pore in the outer membrane via the pseudopilins in the periplasm and a multi-protein inner-membrane sub-complex, to an ATPase in the cytoplasm. The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae uses such a secretion machinery, called the Epssystem, for the export of its major virulence factor cholera toxin into the intestinal tract of the human host. ° Here, we describe the 2.4 A structure of the hetero-tetrameric complex of the N-terminal domain of the ATPase EpsE and the cytoplasmic domain of the inner membrane protein EpsL, which constitute the major cytoplasmic components of the Eps-system. A stable fragment of EpsE in complex with the cytoplasmic domain of EpsL was identified via limited proteolysis and facilitated the crystallization of the complex. This first structure of a complex between two different proteins of the type II secretion system reveals that the N-terminal domain of EpsE and the cytoplasmic domain of EpsL form a hetero-tetramer, in which EpsL is the central dimer and EpsE binds on the periphery. The dimer of EpsL in this complex is very similar to the dimer seen in the crystal structure of the native cytoplasmic domain of EpsL, suggesting a possible physiological ° relevance despite a relatively small 675 A2 buried solvent accessible surface. The N-terminal domain of EpsE, which forms a compact domain with an aCb-fold, places its helix a2 in a mostly hydrophobic cleft between ° domains II and III of EpsL burying 1700 A2 solvent accessible surface. This extensive interface involves several residues whose hydrophobic or charged nature is well conserved and is therefore likely to be of general importance in type II secretion systems.

Introduction

Keywords: EpsE; EpsL; type II secretion; Vibrio cholerae; cholera toxin

Gram-negative bacteria have evolved a number of molecular machineries for the selective transport of various molecules through the cell envelope, ranging from ions and small molecules to proteins. One of such machineries, the type II secretion system (T2SS), enables the export of folded proteins

from the periplasm to the extracellular space.1­3 The assembly of 12­15 so-called Gsp (general secretion pathway) proteins into the T2SS, also called the secreton, spans the entire cell envelope from the "protein conducting" pore in the outer membrane via the pseudopilins in the periplasm and several proteins in the inner membrane sub-complex to an ATPase in the cytoplasm. The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae uses such a system, which consists of 15 so-called Eps proteins,4 for the export of hydrolytic enzymes, such as chitinase, and cholera toxin, the major causative agent of the devastating disease cholera.5 Numerous studies have analyzed individual

846 proteins of the T2SS from different organisms3 in order to increase our understanding of the function and interactions of these components with the ultimate goal of deciphering the mechanism of type II-mediated secretion. 6 The cytoplasmic ATPase EpsE is thought to provide energy for the assembly or gating of the secretion machinery.7 EpsE binds to the inner membrane proteins EpsL and EpsF.8,9 The proteins EpsL, EpsF, EpsM and EpsC form the inner membrane sub-complex of the Eps-system and are able to assemble into several stable binary and ternary associations. The interactions between EpsE, EpsL and EpsM have been analyzed by mutational studies and it appeared that the interface between EpsE and EpsL is formed by the N-terminal 90 residues of EpsE and two regions of EpsL.10 Combined with the recently published X-ray structure of the cytoplasmic domain of EpsL (cyto-EpsL) these two regions could be assigned to domains II and III of cyto-EpsL.11 In recent years, a variety of X-ray structures of individual components of the T2SS have been solved: the N-terminally truncated version of the cytoplasmic ATPase EpsE, 12 the periplasmic domain of the inner membrane protein EpsM (peri-EpsM),13 the periplasmic pseudopilin PulG14 and the cytoplasmic domain of the inner membrane protein EpsL (cyto-EpsL).11 These structures have provided (i) valuable information about the conformation of individual proteins, (ii) models for the hexameric state of EpsE and the pilus formed by PulG, and (iii) revealed unexpected structural homologies between cyto-EpsL and the actin-like ATPase superfamily, and between cyto-EpsM and the ferredoxin superfamily. However, no structural information of interactions at the atomic level

between different Gsp-proteins has been published so far. Here, we report the hetero-tetrameric structure of the N-terminal domain of EpsE (N1-EpsE) in complex with the cytoplasmic domain of EpsL (cyto-EpsL). This completes the picture of all domains of EpsE and provides the first view of two interacting protein partners of the type II secretion system.

Results
Limited proteolysis and design of constructs Co-expression of two variants of EpsE (residues 2­503 and 90­503) with two variants of the cytoplasmic domain of EpsL (cyto-EpsL, residues 1­241 and 1­253) yielded soluble protein for all four combinations. However, only the two combinations with full-length EpsE could be co-purified with cyto-EpsL. This verified on a preparative scale previous observations that the N-terminal 90 residues of EpsE are crucial for EpsE:EpsL interactions.9 However, crystallization attempts of neither the two complexes with full-length EpsE nor full length EpsE alone12 were successful. Therefore, the complexes were analyzed with limited proteolysis using trypsin in order to obtain a complex of stable fragments. Cyto-EpsL appeared not very susceptible to proteolysis, whereas EpsE readily degraded leading to a stable w10 kDa fragment (Figure 1), which could be co-purified with cyto-EpsL. Peptide finger printing mass spectrometry analysis indicated that this fragment consists of the N-terminal residues 1­88 of EpsE. Hence, based on sequence conservation (Figure 2)

Figure 1. Limited proteolysis of EpsE:cyto-EpsL complexes. Limited proteolysis experiments of two EpsE:cyto-EpsL complexes with trypsin show that full-length EpsE is by far more susceptible to proteolysis than cyto-EpsL. The constructs for N1-EpsE are based on the stable EpsE fragment, which could be co-purified with cyto-EpsL. The numbers below the lanes indicate trypsin concentrations in mg/ml; T is a lane with trypsin only. The initial concentration of the complex was approximately 0.5 mg/ml.

The construct for N1-EpsE is marked with the bar below the sequences: blue indicates ordered residues, the disordered residues of the termini are colored gray.

and secondary structure prediction, two constructs for co-expression were made: EpsE(1-96): EpsL(1-241) and EpsE(1-117):EpsL(1-241). Soluble EpsE:cyto-EpsL complexes could be co-purified to homogeneity from both co-expression systems, but only the EpsE(1-96): EpsL(1-241) (hereinafter referred to as N1E:cytoL) complex could then be crystallized. Structure solution The crystals of EpsE(1-96):EpsL(1-241) (N1E: cytoL) belong to space group P21 and contain two copies of the complex per asymmetric unit. ° A complete data set could be collected to 2.4 A resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of cyto-EpsL11 (PDB-code: 1W97) as the search model, and refined with satisfactory geometrical statistics to RworkZ 19.1% and RfreeZ25.2% (Table 1; Figure 3). The model contains two copies each of cyto-EpsL and N1-EpsE, 178 water molecules and one Ca2C. The electron density did not allow us to model the terminal residues L-Val1, L-Leu240 and L-Lys241, nor the C-terminal His6-tag for cyto-EpsL. For N1-EpsE, the N-terminal 13 and C-terminal 15 residues could not be placed. The electron density for many residues in domain II of cyto-EpsL in the complex with N1-EpsE is ° much better defined than in the original 2.7 A

Figure 3. The structure of the hetero-tetramer of N1E:cytoL and the topology of N1-EpsE. (a) In the representation of the hetero-tetramer of N1E:cytoL, N1-EpsE is colored in purple both in the ribbon representation and in the surface representation. The two protomers of cyto-EpsL are colored according to the domains in blue (domain I), yellow (domain II) and red (domain III) or in yellow, respectively. Cyto-EpsL forms a homo-dimer. N1-EpsE is bound at the periphery of the complex and interacts with domains II and III of the adjacent cyto-EpsL protomer. (b) N1-EpsE forms a compact domain and consists of a central three-stranded mixed b-sheet, which is lined on one side by three helices. The sequence of secondary structure elements in N1-EpsE is a1-bA-bB-a2-bC-a3. (c) The sequence conservation as determined by Consurf16 plotted on the surface of N1-EpsE, which is shown in the same orientation as in (b). Red indicates high, blue indicates low sequence conservation. The surface of the a-helical side, involved in EpsE:EpsL interactions, is much higher conserved than the b-sheet side. The positions of six totally conserved surface residues are indicated. Almost all of them are involved in contacts with cyto-EpsL.

structure of cyto-EpsL alone.11 Therefore, the refined model of cyto-EpsL from the complex was used to improve the original structure of uncomplexed cyto-EpsL to a more complete model with better geometrical statistics and better R-factors: RworkZ21.3% and RfreeZ26.8% (Table 1) compared with RworkZ24.8% and RfreeZ29.0% in the initial structure of cyto-EpsL.11 Tertiary structure of cyto-EpsL in the N1E:cytoLcomplex The overall fold of cyto-EpsL has already been described by Abendroth et al.11 as a three-domain structure with unexpected similarities to the actinlike ATPase superfamily. While the conserved domains 1A and 2A of the actin-like ATPases are represented by domains I and III of cyto-EpsL, respectively, the non-conserved domains 1B and 2B of the actin-like ATPases are absent in cyto-EpsL. Domain II of cyto-EpsL has only been observed in a single member of the actin-like ATPase superfamily: the cell division protein FtsA.15 This presence and absence of domains makes cytoEpsL an unusual member of the actin-like ATPase superfamily. In addition, unlike the vast majority of

the actin-like proteins, cyto-EpsL does not have a nucleotide-binding site. The previously unstructured region in domain II formed by residues L-Pro70 to L-Asp95 now appears to adopt, both in the complex and in the improved cyto-EpsL structure, the conformation of an a-helix (L-Leu77 to L-Leu85) followed by a 310-helix (L-Glu86 to L-Glu88). One metal ion appears to be coordinated by the backbone carbonyl of L-Ala180 and the carboxylate group of L-Asp182 from one chain of cyto-EpsL and by the carboxylate group of L-Asp92 and L-Asp95 from a symmetry-related molecule of cyto-EpsL. Because of the high concentration of calcium acetate in the crystallization buffer (200 mM), this metal was modeled as Ca2C. However, as this strong difference (8.5s in mFoKDFc electron density maps) was neither observed in the other chain of cyto-EpsL, which is in a different crystallographic environment, nor in the native cyto-EpsL structure, this metal is most likely a crystallization artifact and not physiologically relevant. There are only minor differences between the improved structure of uncomplexed cyto-EpsL and both chains in the complex as reflected in a root° mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.7 A for Ca

849 between cyto-EpsL and N1-EpsE, which bury ° 1700 A 2. The second largest interface occurs ° between the two copies of cyto-EpsL (675 A2). The buried surfaces are to be compared with a total ° ° surface of 12,500 A2 for cyto-EpsL and 4600 A2 for N1-EpsE. The two copies of N1-EpsE do not contact one another, nor any of their crystallographic symmetry mates. All other interfaces seen in the crystal are significantly smaller than the EpsE-EpsL and EpsL-EpsL contact areas. The shape correlation Sc as calculated by the program SC21 amounts to 0.67 and 0.72 for the two N1E:cytoL interfaces, which is in the same range as observed for oligomeric interfaces.21 The cytoL:cytoL interface

° atoms and of 1.2 A for all atoms. The RMS differences between the two subunits of cyto-EpsL ° in the complex are in a comparable range: 0.5 A a ° for all atoms. The overall for C atoms and 1.0 A B-factor of domain II in the uncomplexed cyto-EpsL structure remains significantly higher than for the ° ° ° other domains (I, 97 A2; II, 143 A2; III, 103 A2, for the revised structure). In contrast, the overall domain B-factors are much more even and lower in the ° ° ° complex structure (I, 58 A2 and 62 A2; II, 65 A2 and ° ° ° 2; III, 64 A2 and 55 A2 for chain A and B, 67 A respectively). Tertiary structure of N1-EpsE in the N1E:cytoLcomplex N1-EpsE is the novel part of the complex. The N-terminal domain of EpsE adopts a compact aCb structure consisting of three a-helices and three b-strands (Figure 3(b)). The three strands each are five to six residues long and form a mixed b-sheet, in which the central strand bB is antiparallel to bA and parallel to bC. The three helices flank the b-sheet on one side close to strand bA. The central helix a1 is the shortest helix, consisting of only seven residues, whereas helices a2 and a3 are 11­12 residues long. There is no distinct distribution of charged residues on the surface of N1-EpsE (data not shown). However, by plotting the sequence conservation as determined by Consurf16 on the surface of N1-EpsE, the a-helical side appears to be by far more conserved than the b-strand side of the domain (Figure 3(c)). By searching databases for structurally homologous proteins using DALI17 and MATRAS,18 a part of the C-terminal domain of the enzyme mesodiaminopimelic acid dehydrogenase (DapDH) from Corneybacterium glutamicum19 (PDB-code: 1DAP) could be identified as the closest structural homolog ° to N1-EpsE with an RMSD of 3.0 A over 62 aligned residues and a sequence identity of 11%. In spite of the rather poor alignment statistics, the topology of both structures is very similar. Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of DapDH contains a Rossmann-fold, which can be superimposed with the ATP-binding domain C1 of the C-terminal part of EpsE12 (residues 240­392 and 442­450) with an ° RMSD of 2.7 A over 71 aligned residues and 12% sequence identity. However, the N2-domain of EpsE, which links domains N1-EpsE and C2-EpsE, has no counterpart in DapDH. N1-EpsE also shares a more distant structural homology with a part of gelsolin.20 Quaternary structure of the hetero-tetrameric N1E:cytoL-complex There are two copies of each of N1-EpsE and cyto-EpsL in the asymmetric unit of the P21 crystals, which are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis forming a hetero-tetramer (Figure 3(a)). The largest protein­protein interfaces in the crystals are

The putative dimers of cyto-EpsL in the complex reported here and in the native structure11 are very similar. By superimposing one half of the dimer one can detect a rotation of six degrees, which relates the two copies of the other half of the dimer. In both structures, the majority of the interactions are made via backbone atoms of strands b3 of both cyto-EpsL protomers, extending the five-stranded b-sheet of domain I into a ten-stranded sheet. The cytoL:cytoL ° interface buries a total of 750 A2 in the native ° 2 in the complex. The shape structure and 675 A correlation Sc21 for the cytoL:cytoL interface is 0.58 for the native structure and 0.53 for cyto-EpsL in complex with N1-EpsE, respectively, which is below the average for oligomeric interfaces. The N1E:cytoL interface Analyses of chimeric proteins,10 sequence conservation and the structure of native cyto-EpsL11 led to the conclusion that domains II and III of cytoEpsL should provide the binding site of EpsE. Gratifyingly, in the N1E:cytoL structure N1-EpsE indeed binds in these regions, wedging its helix a2 in the deep cleft between domains II and III of cytoEpsL (Figures 3(a) and 4). Most interactions found in the structure of the complex are hydrophobic and occur in three clusters along the sequence of cytoEpsL (Figure 2): (1) Residues L-Asp61 to L-Thr65, part of helix 3101 and strand bE of domain II, interact with residues from helix a2 of N1-EpsE. Residues L-Asp61, L-Leu62 and L-Leu63 are involved in hydrophobic interactions with residues of helix a2 from N1-EpsE (Figure 2). L-Thr65 forms a hydrogen bond to E-Glu49 of N1-EpsE. (2) Residues L-Asp87 to L-Gln91, part of a loop between the helices aII-1 and aII-2 of domain II, interact with residues from helices a1 and a2 of N1-EpsE. Residues L-Glu88 and L-Ala90 are involved in hydrophobic interactions with residues from helix a1 and a2 of N1-EpsE. L-Asp87, L-Ala90 and L-Glu91 form polar interactions with E-Arg24, E-Glu53 and E-Arg56 from N1-EpsE, respectively.

Figure 4. Interactions between N1-EpsE and cyto-EpsL. (a) Stereo Figure of the location of the binding interface and the interactions between N1-EpsE and cyto-EpsL. N1-EpsE is colored in magenta and green, the three domains of cytoEpsL are colored in blue, yellow and red, respectively. Residues involved in N1E:cytoL interactions are indicated with spheres on the respective Ca-positions. N1-EpsE protrudes with its helix a2 into the cleft formed by domains II (yellow) and III (red) of cyto-EpsL. The majority of interacting residues of N1-EpsE are located on helix a2, other contributions are made by residues from helix a1 and strand bC. Residues of cyto-EpsL involved in interactions are mostly part of a loop C-terminal of helix aII1 (domain II), further contributions come from residues on strands bE (domain II) and bK, and helix a3 (domain III). (b) "Butterfly" representation of the interface. The N1E:cytoL complex has been taken apart and N1-EpsE rotated by 1808. The original orientation of N1-EpsE is indicated with a translucent gray surface. Residues involved in interactions are colored on the surfaces of N1-EpsE (magenta) and cyto-EpsL (yellow) according to the nature of the contacts. Most of the N1E:cytoL interactions are hydrophobic contacts (green); only a few interactions are polar (blue), all of which involve residues from domain II of cyto-EpsL.

(3) Residues L-Met168 to L-Ser181, part of strand bK and helix a3 of domain III, interact with residues from helix a2 and from strand bC of N1-EpsE. Residues L-Met168, L-Trp174, L-Leu177 and L-Leu178 are involved in hydrophobic interactions with residues from helix a2 and strand bC of N1-EpsE.

The majority of residues of cyto-EpsL interacting with N1-EpsE are fairly conserved within the sequence family. However, none of the absolutely conserved residues of cyto-EpsL (e.g. L-Glu86 and L-His101), which were in fact suspected to be part of the EpsE:EpsL interface, appear to be involved in protein­protein interactions. Most of the few

851 last ordered residue (E-Gln81) is followed by a stretch of very hydrophilic residues (RDSSE), which might indicate a flexible loop or a flexible linker between the N-terminal domains N1 and N2. Supported by the high sequence conservation, there is a distinct possibility that the flexibility of the linker between domain N1 and the rest of EpsE, has a specific function during the energy or signal transduction from EpsE to the rest of the Epssystem. The same might be true for the overall flexibility of EpsE, although the small protective effect of ligands on limited proteolysis (J.A., M.P. & W.G.J.H., data not shown) has not supported this so far. One of the many mysteries of the T2SS is how the ATP can be spent productively. After all, futile cycling has to be avoided and the hydrolysis of ATP only makes sense if the substrate protein to be transported is presented to the T2SS. Quaternary structure of EpsL

residues of cyto-EpsL involved in polar interactions (L-Thr65, L-Asp87, L-Ala90 and L-Gln91) are part of the region that is highly flexible in the uncomplexed structure of cyto-EpsL.11 The majority of residues of N1-EpsE interacting with cyto-EpsL are clustered in helix a2 (Figures 2 and 4). Further contributions from N1-EpsE come from residues of helix a1 and strand bC. As helix a2 of N1-EpsE is wedged in the cleft between domains II and III of cyto-EpsL (Figure 4), it interacts with residues both from domain II and domain III of cyto-EpsL. Residues from helix a1 of N1-EpsE exclusively interact with domain II of cyto-EpsL, whereas residues from strand bC of N1-EpsE exclusively interact with domain III of cyto-EpsL. Most of the residues involved in the interactions are highly conserved within different species, including the absolutely conserved residues E-Pro19, E-Glu53 and E-Arg56 (Figure 2).

Discussion
Complexes of EpsE:EpsL and flexibility of EpsE The goal of these studies was to obtain an understanding at the atomic level of the interactions between the proteins EpsE and EpsL from the T2SS of V. cholerae. Expression and purification of variants of EpsE with variants of the cytoplasmic domain of EpsL (cyto-EpsL) confirmed in vitro the previous finding that the N-terminal 90 residues of EpsE are indispensable for complex formation between EpsE and EpsL.9 Crystallographic studies of EpsE, however, had shown that a deletion of these N-terminal 90 residues was necessary to obtain well-diffracting crystals of the two major domains of EpsE.12 Furthermore, limited proteolysis of both the complex of full-length proteins EpsE: EpsL:EpsM (J.A. & W.G.J.H., data not shown) and of the complex of full-length EpsE with cyto-EpsL (Figure 1) indicated that EpsE is by far more susceptible to proteolytic degradation than either EpsL or EpsM, underlining the general flexibility of EpsE. The addition of known small-molecule binding partners of EpsE, such as ATP and analogs, and divalent cations, had only little effect on its susceptibility to proteolysis. These data suggest that EpsE is a very flexible molecule and hence, it does not appear too surprising that complexes of cyto-EpsL with fulllength EpsE did not crystallize so far. Limited proteolysis of the EpsE:cyto-EpsL complex provided a stable fragment of EpsE, which could be co-purified with cyto-EpsL, and which subsequently could be crystallized. Both the N-terminal 13 residues and the C-terminal 15 residues of N1-EpsE had no representative electron density and most are likely disordered in the crystal. For the N-terminal residues this is in accordance with very little sequence conservation (Figure 2). However, the flexible C-terminal residues E-Arg82 to E-Gly95 are highly conserved. The

Full-length EpsL has been reported to form at least dimers6,22,23 whereas cyto-EpsL appears to be a monomer in solution.11 The native crystal structure of cyto-EpsL suggested a putative dimer formed by crystallographic symmetry mates. The residues involved in the dimer interface are fairly conserved. However, both the fact that a significant part of the interactions involve main-chain atoms, which suggested that the interactions are not sequence specific, and the comparatively small ° size of the interface (700 A2) raised the possibility that this dimer was a crystallization artifact possibly as result of the high protein concentration. According to gel permeation chromatography and dynamic light scattering experiments (data not shown), also the complex of N1E:cytoL appears to be a hetero-dimer in solution containing one copy of each protein. The cyto-EpsL dimers observed in the uncomplexed structure of cyto-EpsL and in the hetero-tetrameric complex of N1E:cytoL occur in a completely different crystal packing environment, yet, they closely resemble one another. This supports, although not proves, the hypothesis that this dimer indeed has physiological significance. The six degree rotation of one subunit versus the other between the dimeric arrangements might be due to crystal contacts or could reflect conformational changes occurring during the functioning of the type II secretion machinery. The small buried surface and the limited shape complementarity of this interface make it possible that the described cytoL:cytoL dimer, even when seen in two independent crystal structures, is a crystallization artifact. Further structures of larger complexes of the Eps-system will have to give conclusive evidence on the quaternary structure of EpsL. The EpsE:EpsL interface Functional analyses of EpsL chimera consisting of different domains from V. cholerae and A. hydrophila suggested that two regions of EpsL are required for

852 binding to EpsE.10 These regions could later be assigned to domains II and III of cyto-EpsL.11 The crystal structure of native cyto-EpsL revealed a deep cleft between domains II and III. Domain II has a significantly higher degree of conserved surface residues than any of the other domains, yet this domain appeared by far the most flexible domain of the structure.11 These observations led to the conclusion that mostly domain II and probably also domain III should be involved in interactions with EpsE. The new structure of the N1E:cytoL complex now confirms this hypothesis. N1-EpsE, indeed, is wedged with its helix a2 in the cleft between domains II and III of cyto-EpsL (Figure 4). Helix a2 is part of the side of N1-EpsE with the highest degree of conservation of surface residues (Figures 2 and 4). The majority of the protein­protein interactions involve domain II of cyto-EpsL. Several, but not all, of the 14 residues of N1-EpsE involved in protein­protein contacts are highly conserved (Figure 2). Intriguingly, however, the absolutely conserved residues of domain II of cytoEpsL (L-Glu86 and L-His101), are not part of the interface. Most of the interactions are hydrophobic, only N1-EpsE residues E-Arg24, E-Glu49, E-Glu53 and E-Arg56 are involved in polar contacts, of which E-Glu53 and E-Arg56 stand out as the only absolutely conserved residues of N1-EpsE involved in polar contacts. Although N1-EpsE binds to the deep cleft between domains II and III of cyto-EpsL, it only occupies part of the groove (Figure 4). Both the C and N termini of N1-EpsE are distant from the interface, which suggests that no immediately adjacent parts of full-length EpsE are likely to bind to the unoccupied part of this inter-domain groove. Although the surface residues of the unoccupied part of the cleft of cyto-EpsL are not as conserved as the residues involved in N1-EpsEbinding, they still might be involved in binding to other proteins of the Eps-systems. For instance, other parts of the large C-terminal domain of EpsE might possibly bind in this area in a liganddependent manner. However, these additional contacts would be fairly weak, as various analyses have shown that EpsE variants without the first 90 residues do not form a complex with EpsE. Clearly, the N-terminal 90 residues are indispensable for EpsE:EpsL-binding. A further possible binding partner might be the integral membrane protein EpsF, which is a component of the inner membrane subcomplex of the T2SS.8 Structural homologies The N-terminal 90 residues of EpsE form a compact domain. No small protein could be found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) of which the major part has strong structural homologies with N1EpsE. However, a part of the C-terminal domain of DapDH from C. glutamicum19 (PDB-code: 1DAP) could be identified as the closest structural homolog

sharing a very similar topology in spite of rather poor alignment statistics. As the nucleotide-binding domain C1 of EpsE also aligns with the dinucleotide-binding domain of DapDH, we tried to exploit these structural homologies to create a hexameric model of EpsE12 complexed with EpsL. However, significant conformational changes would have been required to avoid serious steric clashes of several subunits and hence this model building exercise was not pursued further. A more distant structural homolog to N1-EpsE is the repeating domain of gelsolin, which have been crystallized in complex with actin20 (PDB-code: 1H1V). The superposition of N1-EpsE with gelsolin ° domains yields an RMSD of 2.3 A over 46 aligned residues and a sequence identity of 9%. The homology is limited to the three-stranded b-sheet and helix a2 of N1-EpsE. Given the structural homology between cyto-EpsL and actin,11 it is most intriguing that the topologically conserved helix makes major protein­protein interactions both in the N1E:cytoL complex and in the gelsolin:actin complex. Remarkably, however, the binding regions on actin and cyto-EpsL are entirely unrelated: whereas a2 of EpsE binds in the cleft between domains II and III of cyto-EpsL, the corresponding helix in gelsolin binds to domains 1A and 2A of actin, which correspond to domains I and III in cyto-EpsL. Conclusions The structure of the N1E:cytoL complex for the first time provides a picture at the atomic level of interactions between different components of the Eps-system. Together with the previously determined structures of D90-EpsE12 and cyto-EpsL,11 the cytoplasmic subcomplex presently is the best structurally characterized part of the Eps-system. Obviously, many more interactions between Eps proteins need to be unraveled to obtain an understanding of the mode of operation of this fascinating machinery.

Experimental Procedures
Cloning and expression The constructs for co-expression of full-length EpsE and cyto-EpsL were created by PCR amplification from a construct encoding for full-length EpsE and EpsL (M.S. & M.B., unpublished results) and ligated into a pET21d(C) vector using NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. The construct for co-expression of EpsE1-96 and cyto-EpsL was created by PCR amplification of the individual gene fragments from the same vector as mentioned above. The interagenic sequence was in part replaced by a NotI restriction site. The two PCR products were ligated into a pET21d(C) vector using NcoI, NotI and XhoI and restriction sites. In all constructs, a His6-tag was attached to the C terminus of cyto-EpsL. For the synthesis of native protein by expression of cloned gene fragments in Escherichia coli BL21gold(DE3)

CaOAc2, 100 mM Bis­Tris­HCl (pH 5.75), 25% PEG 3350) and subsequently in the same buffer with increasing amounts of glycerol (5%, 10%, 15%, v/v) replacing water. The crystals were vitrified by plunging them directly into liquid nitrogen. Data sets were collected at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute beamline 8.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley on a tiled 3!3 ADSC Quantum 315 ° detector. Data were collected at a wavelength of 0.9999 A in 18 wedges over 1808 (see Table 1). The data were processed with MOSFLM24 and reduced with SCALA25 using the using the automated Wedger script.26

cells, 20 ml of an overnight culture in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) containing 100 mg/ml of carbenicillin were used after washing twice to inoculate a 1 l culture of LB with 100 mg/ml of ampicillin. The main culture was grown at 37 8C and expression was induced at A600 nmZ0.6 by addition of 1 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested after three hours and pelleted by centrifugation at 5000g for 20 minutes. Purification The pelleted cells were suspended in 15 ml lysis buffer per gram cell paste (50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8), 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM PMSF and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). The cells were lysed by sonication and the debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 22,000g for 20 minutes. The clear lysate was then purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. 5 ml Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) was equilibrated with 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8), 150 mM sodium chloride and loaded with the clarified lysate. The column was washed with the same buffer plus 15 mM imidazole and the target protein was eluted with 150 mM imidazole-containing buffer. The pooled fractions were concentrated to 5 ml by ultrafiltration (30 kDa cut-off; Millipore) and diluted tenfold with 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8). The diluted sample was loaded on a MonoQ HR 10/10 anion-exchange column and eluted in a linear gradient from 0 M to 1 M NaCl within 20 column volumes. The pooled peak fractions were further purified via gel-permeation chromatography using Superdex S75 or Superdex S200 resin for N1E:cytoL or EpsE:cyto-EpsL, respectively, in a 100/18 XK column with the following buffer: 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8), 150 mM sodium chloride. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5­10 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined at 595 nm with the Bradford Assay (BioRad) using bovine serum albumin as the reference. Limited proteolysis Limited proteolysis was carried out with purified complexes of full-length EpsE and the cytoplasmic domain of EpsL at approximately 0.5 mg/ml using trypsin and chymotrypsin as proteases. The reactions were done in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8), 10 mM CaCl2. For each protease, a range finding assay was done prior to a time-course assay. The samples were analyzed with native and SDS-PAGE. Crystallization Initial crystallization conditions were searched for using the Index screen (Hampton Research) by mixing equal amounts of protein and reservoir (1.5 ml each) using the sitting-drop variant of the vapor-diffusion method. The initial hit (condition no. 82 : 200 mM MgCl2, 100 mM Bis­Tris­HCl (pH 5.5), 25% (w/v) PEG 3350) was further refined and yielded in the following optimized crystallization condition: 200 mM CaOAc2, 100 mM Bis­Tris­ HCl (pH 5.75), 15­20% PEG 3350. Crystals appeared within one week and grew to a final size of 0.2 mm! 0.2 mm!0.5 mm. Similar crystals also grew in the presence of other divalent cations, such as MgCl2, MgOAc2 and MnCl2. Vitrification and data collection Crystals were transferred into a storage buffer (200 mM

Structure solution and refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement ° with MOLREP27 at 3 A resolution using the structure of cyto-EpsL11 (PDB-code: 1W97) as a search model. The quality of the initial maps was significantly improved by the prime-and-switch density modification of RESOLVE.28 The model was iteratively built using COOT29 and O30 and refined with TLS parameters using REFMAC531 (vsn. 5.2.0005). The quality of the model was continuously monitored with PROCHECK.32 Superpositions of homologous structures were done with COOT29 using SSM.33

Preparation of Figures Figure 2 was prepared with ESPript,34 Figures 3 and 4 with PyMol, similarities of surface residues in Figure 3 were calculated with CONSURF.16
