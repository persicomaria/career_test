ABSTRACT Cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is a highly conserved and widely distributed protein that links the nutritional response signaling to cytoskeleton remodeling. In yeast, CAP is a component of the adenylyl cyclase complex and helps to activate the Ras-mediated catalytic cycle of the cyclase. While the N-terminal domain of CAP (NCAP) provides a binding site for adenylyl cyclase, the C-terminal domain (C-CAP) possesses actin binding activity. Our attempts to crystallize full-length recombinant CAP from Dictyostelium discoideum resulted in growth of orthorhombic crystals containing only the N-terminal domain (residues 42­227) due to auto-proteolytic cleavage. The structure was ° solved by molecular replacement with data at 2.2 A resolution. The present crystal structure allows the characterization of a head-to-tail N-CAP dimer in the asymmetric unit and a crystallographic side-toside dimer. Comparison with previously published structures of N-CAP reveals variable modes of dimerization of this domain, but the presence of a common interface for the side-to-side dimer.

Key words: ASP-56; CAP; crystal structure; MCH1; protein crystallography; protein­protein interactions; Srv2 INTRODUCTION A large number of motile and morphogenetic processes in eukaryotic cells are dependent on the assembly and rapid turnover of highly dynamic filaments of the actin cytoskeleton. The actual state of these filaments as constituted by form, dynamics, localization, and mechanical properties is regulated by a number of actin-binding proteins which, in turn, are controlled by various signaling pathways. One family of conserved eukaryotic proteins regulating actin dynamics is the cyclase-associated proteins (CAPs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these proteins copurify with adenylyl cyclase1 and were identified as a suppressor of the activated ras allele.2,3 It is now generally accepted that CAP determines cell polarity and affects

development (for a recent review see Hubberstey and Mottillo4). In yeast, CAP (alias Srv2) localizes to the cortical actin patches, via interaction with actin filament binding protein 1 (Abp1p).5,6 Deletion of CAP in yeast,7,8 Drosophila melanogaster9 ­11 and Dictyostelium discoideum12,13 generally results in developmental defects. At the molecular level, it has been shown for Dictyostelium and yeast that CAP is needed for adenylyl cyclase activity.13 Full-length CAP constitutes an N-terminal domain, required for Ras response,7 a C-terminal domain that interacts with the cytoskeleton, and a middle domain harboring two prolinerich regions (mammalian CAPs only). Biochemically and genetically, it has been shown in S. cerevisiae that the N-terminal 36 residues of CAP bind to the C-terminal domain of adenylyl cyclase, presumably by coiled-coil interactions.14 A recent study of a Dictyostelium knockout mutant also suggested an interaction of CAP with adenylyl cyclase.13 The catalytic activity of the cyclase is activated by Ras binding, which is facilitated by CAP, probably by providing a binding site for the Ras farnesyl group.15 The adenylyl cyclase binding site in the mammalian homologues of CAP is conserved, although they do not interact with the cyclase directly due to the lack of a CAP-binding domain in the mammalian cyclases.16 Meanwhile, in all the CAP homologues studied so far, the C-terminal domain has been reported to bind actin monomers.7,16 ­21 To date, there has been no evidence for the existence of multiple CAP genes in nonmammalian species.

in mammals, at least two CAP gene products (CAP1 and CAP2) share about 64% identity.4 In a recent study, CAP1 was found to be expressed in the non-muscle cells of mice, while CAP2 is only expressed in striated muscles and certain brain regions.22 Furthermore, using CAP1 knockout cells, the authors observed that CAP1 promotes rapid actin filament depolymerization, and is required for proper subcellular localization and function of actin-deploymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin. These results agree with earlier studies6,23 and a functional CAP model has been proposed where the N-terminal domain of CAP1 acts, together with cofilin, as an accelerator of F-actin depolymerization at the pointed end of actin filaments. Likewise, the C-terminal domain of CAP1 is involved in filament elongation at the barbed end. The role of CAP1 in actin filament turnover thus appears to be the efficient recycling of cofilin and actin. Apparently, the view of CAP as a bifunctional protein, with the N-terminal domain responsible for proper signal transduction and the C-terminal domain involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, seems to be oversimplified. Now, there is evidence that the N-terminal domain of CAP interacts with the actin:cofilin complex, while the C-terminal domain interacts with F-actin.23 An important role is also inferred for the proline-rich middle region, which might act in combination with the N- or C-terminal domain.13 Early on, a functional link between CAP and profilin had been proposed for CAP from S. cerevisiae.8 A study using human CAP constructs indicated that profilin II can interact with the proline-rich domain of CAP.24 For Dictyostelium CAP, this interaction seems rather unlikely due to the degeneration of the proline-rich sequence in the middle domain. For yeast CAP, it has been reported that this middle region acts as a binding site for SH3 domains25 and access to the SH3 binding motif directs the subcellular translocation of CAP.16,21 It is thus tempting to speculate a structural model of CAP, where the protein can adopt varying conformations with different arrangements of the N- and C-terminal domains with respect to each other, thereby exposing or preventing access to the middle domain. In a mechanism yet to be clarified, these conformations include the formation of CAP homo-oligomers. Despite the wealth of information about the biological implications of CAP, little is known about its molecular mechanisms. Several crystal structures of CAP C-terminal domains have been solved by Almo and colleagues, and are available in the PDB (yeast: 1f5i, 1k4z, 1kq5; human: 1k8f). C-CAP adopts a helix structure, a fold built solely by parallel -strands arranged in a right-handed helical manner. Notably, all structures have been found to be dimeric in the crystals. Recently, the X-ray crystal structure26 and the NMR structure27 of an N-terminal CAP construct have been determined. In contrast to C-CAP, N-CAP adopts an all- helical fold where six helices are arranged in an anti-parallel fashion to yield a six-helix-bundle protein. The NMR and X-ray structures provide consistent data on the conformation of the monomeric protein. In the X-ray structure paper, the authors reported two crystal forms, which contain either a monomer or dimer of N-CAP, respectively.26 They put forward a hypothesis that a magnesium ion is responsible for

the dimerization of the N-terminal domain, although they could not present convincing evidence nor corroborate the finding in their second study. Previously, we have reported the crystallization and X-ray diffraction of a protein obtained from the expression of full-length D. discoideum CAP.28 Structural studies on full-length CAP have been hampered by the notoriously difficult behavior of the protein, which apparently possesses auto-proteolytic activity apart from having the tendency to precipitate at high concentrations in the presence of membranes. In this paper, we report the X-ray crystal structure of N-CAP obtained from the auto-proteolytic fragments of the full-length protein from D. discoideum. The structure reveals the six-helix-bundle fold in agreement with previous studies. However, in the present structure, two different N-CAP dimers are observed, a side-to-side dimer similar to the one reported by Holak and coworkers,26 and a previously unknown head-to-tail dimer. The study also provides evidence that N-CAP dimer formation is independent of magnesium and that the protein is able to engage in a variety of homo-oligomerization modes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization and Data Collection As described previously,28 crystal growth in slightly basic ammonium sulfate conditions (1.8 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M TRIS, pH 8.4) occurs after about seven to eight months and yields only a few crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction. ° The best crystal we obtained so far diffracted to 2.2 A and was used to acquire data set CC1. The X-ray data collected in-house was initially processed in space group C222, since no clear distinction could be made between C222 and C2221 based on an extinction pattern of 00l reflections. Subsequent structure solution with molecular replacement methods clearly indicated that C2221 is the final space group. The data was thus reprocessed with MOSFLM.29 Scaling, merging, and truncation were performed with programs from the CCP4 suite.30 The final data collection statistics are shown in Table I. Structure Solution, Model Building, and Refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe31 and the model of N-CAP (PDB entry 1s0p).

Initially, four N-CAP molecules could be located in space group C222. Close inspection of the packing revealed the presence of a 21 axis parallel to z. In C2221, a clear solution was found for two molecules in the asymmetric unit with correlation coefficients of 38.8 and 59.6 for the first and second molecule, respectively (R factor: 0.496 and 0.410). The initial model was rebuilt with the program O32 and subjected to several cycles of computational refinement interspersed with visual inspection and manual adjustments. Refinement was carried out using the conjugate gradient method with CNS v.1.033 and a maximum likelihood target function. Typical protocols consisted of a positional refinement followed by simulated annealing, grouped and individual B-factor refinement, and a final positional refinement. A bulk solvent model and overall anisotropic B-factor correction (B11 1.41, B22 9.29, B33 10.70, B12 0, B13 0, B23 0) were applied throughout the procedure. The structure was refined to a final R factor of 0.196 (Rfree 0.244) and proper geometry was monitored with the program PROCHECK.34 Refinement statistics are summarized in Table II. The side chains of two residues in molecule 1 (Glu107, Glu111) and five residues in molecule 2 (Glu107, Lys203, Lys206, Thr226, Pro227), which could not be located due to poor electron density, were modeled with Ala. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the PDB (accession number 1tjf).

RESULTS Crystal Packing Initially, when we tried to solve the structure with the assumption that the crystal contains full-length CAP, the lack of success quickly proved otherwise. Using the model of the N-terminal domain of CAP with Patterson search methods, we were able to localize two molecules of N-CAP in the asymmetric unit. In the space group C2221, where the crystallographic 21 axis runs parallel to the z direction, the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are grouped around the 21 axis and shifted ° by 40 A in the z direction. Application of the 21 symmetry ° operator creates another dimer shifted by 83 A in the z direction [Fig. 1(A)]. This results in an arrangement of four protein molecules around a rotation axis parallel to z, where the operation needed to transform one molecule into the next is a rotation of 90° and a subsequent translation along z by about 1/4 c [Fig. 1(B)]. Thus, the packing in the present crystal structure has a pseudo-41 axis superimposed on the 21 symmetry operator. Crystallization in a different space group, such as P4122, is hindered by the fact that the pseudo-41 axes calculated from the first and the second asymmetric dimer are tilted against each other by 1.5°. The Rmerge for processing the data in P4122 yielded 0.154, highlighting the level of imperfection of the pseudo-41 arrangement. Nevertheless, the presence of this pseudo symmetry element is also visible from the extinction pattern in the 00l reflections (Fig. 2).

Overall Structure The visible residues in the present structure extend from 43 to 227 (molecule 1) and from 42 to 227 (molecule 2), respectively. At the N-terminal side of helix 1, residues 43 to 51 adopt a coil conformation in our structure. There is no interpretable electron density from residues 1 to 42, although the packing provides enough space to accommodate these residues. Similarly, the exact determination of the last C-terminal residue was not possible because the electron density does not extend beyond residue 227. The absence of interpretable density from residues 1 to 42 might indicate that the beginning of the N-terminal CAP domain is not structured or that it is a very flexible part of the protein. Alternatively, it is possible that this peptide sequence was cleaved, making the crystallized protein N-terminally truncated. It is interesting to note that Holak and coworkers27 did observe the truncation of an N-terminal CAP construct between residues 50 and 51. The recently published NMR structure of N-CAP indicates that even with the intact N-terminal domain, the first 50 residues might fold only when they are engaged in interactions with a binding partner. Since mass spectrometry analysis of the X-rayed crystals was unsuccessful,28 the actual length of the crystallized protein in this study could not be determined. The structure of the N-terminal domain of CAP as determined in this study agrees well with the N-CAP structures reported earlier.26,27 This is evident from the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between our structure and 1s0p (Table III). N-CAP comprises six antiparallel -helices and adopts the fold of a helix-bundle of ° ° about 50 A in length and 20 A in diameter. The six helices contain about 22 amino acids each and four of them show a significant kink (helix 1 at Gln61, helix 3 at Ile113, helix 4 at Ser143 and helix 5 at Thr173). According to B-factor analysis, the protein possesses flexible regions, especially the loop between helices 5 and 6 (residues 180 ­185), the extreme C-terminal area (residues 221­227) and the first half of helix 3 (residues 106 ­120). Comparison of N-CAP Dimers The C2221 structure of N-CAP as reported here provides new insights into N-CAP dimer formation because two different dimer interactions can be characterized. First, there is the dimer in the asymmetric unit (head-to-tail dimer), whose contact interface is provided by the loops connecting helices 1/ 2 and 3/ 4 (head) in molecule 1 and by the N-terminal tail region in molecule 2 (Fig. 3). Protein­protein interactions for this dimer are direct interactions either between side chains or between back-

bone carbonyl groups and side chains (Table IV). A second dimer (side-to-side dimer) is formed in C2221 by the interactions between one molecule of the asymmetric dimer and a crystallographic symmetry mate (Fig. 4). In contrast to the other dimer, the dimer interface in this case does not show direct contacts between residues from each monomer. Calculations of buried surface areas indicate that the side-to-side dimer possesses an interface of about 10% of the monomer surface, compared to the head-to-tail dimer interface which is only about 7% (Table V). Ksiazek and colleagues26 reported the structure of recombinant N-CAP where only that domain was expressed (PDB entry 1s0p). The authors found crystals belonging to two different space groups, P1 and P21. The P1 crystals contained a side-to-side N-CAP dimer in the asymmetric unit with an anti-parallel arrangement of the two helix-

bundle proteins. The dimer interface of the P1 structure, provided by helices 3 and 4 of two adjacent molecules, has a mainly hydrophobic nature. The authors claim that a Mg2 ion coordinated in this interface by residues Asp128, Arg127, Glu144, Glu144 , Arg127 and Asp128 is responsible for the dimerization, although no supporting evidence was presented. When superimposing the side-to-side dimer from C2221 with the P1 dimer (Fig. 5), it becomes obvious that although the quaternary structures are different, several features are common in both conformations. Compared to the antiparallel arrangement of the monomers in the P1 dimer, the C2221 dimer adopts a conformation where the second molecule is shifted alongside the first molecule, also resulting in an anti-parallel arrangement (Fig. 5). Both dimer interfaces are located at the same side of N-CAP, involving the surfaces of helices 3, 4, and 5. Only one direct interaction of side chains between the two monomers could be identified in our

structure (Gln106-Asn117/Asn118), whereas the P1 dimer exclusively interacts via water molecules. Residues in the interface of both dimers are mainly hydrophobic and there is a file of water molecules running through both interfaces. In an attempt to further characterize the dimers, we analyzed the nearest residues within both interfaces using a cutoff ° distance of 4 A. A summary of this analysis is given in Table IV. Five residues were found to be a part of the dimer interface in both structures: His161, Glu164, Met165, Ser168, and Phe171. While a special feature of the P1 dimer is the coordination of a hexa-aqua-Mg2 complex within the dimer interface, our structure shows the presence of a sulfate ion. The sulfate is provided by the precipitant used for crystallization and is found in the vicinity of residues Ser105 and Gln106 within the interface of the C2221 dimer. Notably, there is also a sulfate ion close to the site where the hexa-aqua-Mg2 complex is bound in the P1 structure

(Arg127, Arg131). Coordination of the sulfate ions by protein residues is only indirect via water molecules. DISCUSSION Findings from the present study allow valuable insights into the oligomerization behavior of CAP. A previous report concluded that Mg2 is responsible for the dimerization of N-CAP thus implying that there is only one specific N-CAP dimer conformation.26 Our orthorhombic structure of N-CAP reveals two dimer conformations: a head-to-tail dimer with a slightly smaller interface and a side-to-side dimer similar to the one previously reported. Comparison of the side-to-side dimers from the orthorhombic and triclinic crystal structures26 shows that, although the conformations are different, there exists a common interface mainly provided by the surface of helix 5. The interface area of the side-to-side dimers is larger than that of the head-to-tail dimer (Table V). The fact that the side-to-side dimers have been observed in two different space groups leads us to assume that these are not crystallization artifacts. Furthermore, in a survey of buried surface areas of structures in the PDB, Janin35 came to the conclusion that complexes with an interface area of ° more than 700 A are very likely to be significant, that is, they are not just crystallization artifacts. With N-CAP, the interface area of the side-to-side dimers is about 10% ° (approximately 900 A2 per monomer) of the entire monomer surface, which makes the biological significance of this dimerization quite likely. For comparison, the head-totail dimer possesses a smaller interface area of about 7% ° (approximately 600 A2 per monomer) which, according to Janin, is less than the threshold for a biologically significant dimerization. Notably, the interactions in the head-totail dimer interface are direct interactions between the side chains and backbone carbonyl groups of the two monomers. Therefore, these interactions are stronger than the nonspecific interactions of the side-to-side dimer. Based on this crystallographic analysis, the side-to-side dimer of N-CAP might be biologically important, whereas the head-to-tail dimer is less likely to occur in solution. It has been reported that CAP can form multimeric complexes with itself, whereby the N-terminal domain is able to interact with either the N-terminal domain16 or the C-terminal domain20 of a second CAP molecule. Similarly, the C-terminal domain of one CAP molecule can also interact with the C-terminal domain of another.20 To date, albeit a single multimerization motif has not been identified, Yu and coworkers16 have reported three N-terminal mutants with decreased multimerization tendencies (L16P, R19T, L27F; residue numbers for Srv2). Their data support the earlier hypothesis that the N-terminal region of CAP contains a site responsible for multimerization.20,21 However, there is no structural data available which would allow further conclusions. There is now structural evidence based on this study showing that N-CAP can engage in at least two modes of intermolecular interactions, although the entire N-terminal domain possesses at least three different interaction sites for multimerization. Additionally, the existence of at

least two conformations of N-CAP side-to-side dimers emphasizes the high degree of variability inherent in this protein. At the molecular level, this variability is most likely due to the nonspecific, "shape-determined" interactions within the dimer interface. This complex situation is mirrored by observations of CAP in solution, which indicate the presence of hexamers.26 Therefore, we would like to hypothesize that, in the absence of its physiological binding partners, CAP oligomers might lack a required element of organization, thus allowing the molecules to engage in nonspecific associations. This hypothesis is supported by the high tendency of the full-length protein to precipitate above a certain concentration (Mohd Yusof et al., unpublished). The variable conformations of the side-to-side dimers of N-CAP, a helix-bundle protein, are also interesting from a topological point of view. This is because the crystal structures of GFP, a -barrel protein, have revealed different dimer conformations.36 The cylindrical shape of barrel and bundle proteins seems to foster the formation of variable protein­protein interactions, probably because the protein surface appears rather smooth compared to other globular folds with distinct domains or structural features. Recently, we reported for the first time that recombinant full-length CAP undergoes self-cleavage, irrespective of the presence of protease inhibitors, rendering mixtures of unprocessed full-length CAP, N-CAP, and C-CAP (starting at residue 279).28 Subsequent publications on CAP mention that an N-terminal construct of CAP (residues 1­226) is processed, even in the presence of protease inhibitors, and the degradation products lack the extreme N-terminal region (residues 1­53, 1­50, 1­ 48, 1­ 43).27 To date, the mechanisms of CAP auto-proteolysis remain unclear. However, these observations emphasize the importance of the physiological binding partners of CAP for its function, and probably for the investigation of its molecular mechanisms, since complexes comprising full-length CAP might increase the stability of this protein. CONCLUSION With the availability of the three-dimensional structures of N- and C-terminal domains of CAP, first insights into the molecular properties of this important protein have become accessible. Correlating the structural findings with biochemical/cell biological data, it is clear that CAP can employ variable modes of homo-oligomerization. Although the crystal structures have only revealed interactions of the same domains (N-CAP/N-CAP or C-CAP/CCAP), it is possible that the protein can also engage in other interactions such as N-CAP/C-CAP (see also Hubberstey and Mottillo4). Therefore, further studies will be necessary to elucidate the complex molecular mechanisms of this protein. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We gratefully acknowledge financial support for this study by the BBSRC.
