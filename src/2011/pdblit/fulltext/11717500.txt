The X-ray structure of a recombinant major urinary Ê protein at 1.75 A resolution. A comparative study of X-ray and NMR-derived structures
Major urinary proteins belong to the lipocalin family and are present in the urine of rodents as an ensemble of isoforms with pheromonal activity. The crystal structure of a recombinant mouse MUP (rMUP) was solved by the molecularreplacement technique and re®ned to an R factor and Rfree Ê of 20 and 26.5%, respectively, at 1.75 A resolution. The structure was compared with an NMR model and with a crystallographic structure of the wild-type form of the protein. The crystal structures determined in different space groups present signi®cantly smaller conformational differences amongst themselves than in comparison with NMR models. Some, but not all, of the conformational differences between the crystal and solution structures can be explained by the in¯uence of crystallographic contacts. Most of the differences between the NMR and X-ray structures were found in the N-terminus and loop regions. A number of side chains lining the hydrophobic pocket of the molecule are more tightly packed in the NMR structure than in the crystallographic model. Surprisingly, clear and continuous electron density for a ligand was observed inside the hydrophobic pocket of this recombinant protein. Conformation of the ligand modelled inside the density is coherent with the results of recent NMR experiments.

1. Introduction
It is now widely accepted that the pace of sexual maturation of female rodents is dependent on chemical signalling. Indeed, male rats and mice synthesize and excrete a large amount of highly homologous proteins namely 2-globulin (2u) in rats and major urinary protein (MUP) in mice (Dinh et al., 1965; Finlayson et al., 1986). Both belong to a large group of structurally homologous proteins named calycins (Flower et al., 1993) owing to their basket-shaped structure made up of antiparallel -sheets. The calycin protein superfamily subdivides itself into three families: the fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs), the avidins and the lipocalins (Flower et al., 1993). In spite of their poor sequence similarity, all these proteins are structurally characterized by an antiparallel -barrel with +1 topology formed by ten -strands in the case of FABPs and eight -strands in the case of the lipocalins. They are all involved in the binding and transport of small hydrophobic molecules. Lipocalins share the same N-terminal motif consisting of a 310-helix that leads into the ®rst -strand. They are speci®cally involved in the transport of retinoids, steroids and pheromones, in olfaction, in immune-system regulation and in the mediation of cell homeostasis.

MUPs are members of the lipocalin family. They form an ensemble of closely related proteins that, being expressed in the liver under androgenic control (Knopf et al., 1983; Kuhn et al., 1984), are secreted into the serum, ®ltered by the kidney and excreted in the urine. Not much attention was given to these proteins until a signi®cant sequence similarity with the pyrazine-binding proteins from calf nasal mucosa was found and their possible pheromonal function was identi®ed (Cavaggioni et al., 1987, 1990; Mucignat-Carretta et al., 1995). Several volatile pheromones, in particular 2-sec-butyl4,5-dihydrothiazole, were shown to bind to MUPs, being subsequently slowly released into the air as the urine dries out. These volatile components, traf®cked by MUPs, are able to stimulate the sexual maturation of mice (Novotny et al., 1999). However, whether MUPs are mere pheromone carriers or have some pheromonal activity of their own is still an open question. It was shown that MUPs, acting via the vomeronasal organ (VNO), can accelerate the onset of puberty in female mice, thus raising the hypothesis of the existence of MUP receptors in the VNO (Bocskei et al., 1992). This conjecture was supported by the identi®cation of genes encoding for putative pheromone receptors (Dulac & Axel, 1995; Ryba & Tirindelli, 1997). Furthermore, it was recently shown that proteins from rat urine were able to activate a speci®c type of G protein in the VNO (Krieger et al., 1999). Three distinct families of pheromone receptors were identi®ed in the VNO (Ryba & Tirindelli, 1997; Krieger et al., 1999; Martini et al., 2001), namely the V1R and V3R families speci®c for small hydrophobic molecules and the V2R family activated by pheromones of proteic nature. Since the physiological cycle of MUPs is quite complex, understanding the structure±function relationship of these proteins requires a precise knowledge of their structure and dynamics. The crystal structure of the wild-type MUP Ê (wtMUP) was solved and re®ned to 2.4 A resolution in the tetragonal crystal form (Bocskei et al., 1992). Recently, the solution structure of a recombinant MUP (rMUP) was È determined (Lucke et al., 1999). Although the overall fold of the protein in solution is similar to that reported in the crystal structure (Bocskei et al., 1992), a number of local differences È in the main-chain conformation were observed (Lucke et al., 1999). This does not seem particularly surprising, as the X-ray structure was derived from the crystal obtained from a mixture of isoforms carrying a heterogeneous ligand population, while the NMR-derived structure is obtained from a single recombinant isoform. In order to verify whether these differences are indeed representative of the crystal and solution state, the structure of rMUP crystallized in a monoclinic space group was solved and Ê re®ned to 1.75 A resolution; a comparison between the existing structures of this protein is presented.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Protein expression

The recombinant mouse major urinary protein (rMUP) was expressed in the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris and puri®ed as described previously (Ferrari et al., 1997). The sequence of this recombinant MUP is deposited in the EMBLNEW databank with accession code MMU309921.
2.2. Crystallization

The crystals used for data collection were grown by hanging-drop vapour diffusion at 291 K in sodium phosphate buffer at pH near 6.5. 60 mM CdCl2 was used as the precipitant. Drops consisted of equal volumes of protein at 10 mg mlÀ1 concentration and well solution (well volume = 1.0 ml). Crystals of dimensions 0.4 Â 0.15 Â 0.1 mm grew in four weeks. Diffraction data were collected on a MAR Research 345 mm imaging plate at the Protein Crystallographic (PCr) beamline (Polikarpov et al., 1998) at the Â Â Laboratorio Nacional de Luz Sõncrotron (LNLS), Campinas, Ê Brazil. The initial diffraction resolution limit was 1.4 A, but gradually decreased during data collection.

The programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) were used for data processing. A data set consisting of 80 oscillation photographs with an oscillation range of 1.0 was collected from a single unfrozen crystal to Ê 1.75 A resolution. The overall Rmerge was 7.9% and Rmerge for

The asymmetric unit cell contains one rMUP molecule and the solvent content is about 48%. A molecular-replacement solution was found with the program AMoRe (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994; Navaza, 1994) using the previously reported Ê crystal structure of wtMUP determined at 2.4 A resolution as a search model (PDB code 1mup; Bocskei et al., 1992). The top solution for the rotation function has a correlation coef®cient of 32.5%, whereas the next highest peak was below 17%. A translational position was found which yielded an R factor of 44% and a correlation coef®cient of 68.7%. The packing arrangement of the molecules in the unit cell for this solution yielded no unfavourable intermolecular contacts.

Positional and temperature-factor re®nement were carried out using REFMAC (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) against all measured re¯ections to a resoluÊ tion of 1.75 A. The re®nement calculation was interleaved with several rounds of model building with the program O (Jones et al., 1991). Water molecules were added using the program ARP (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The ®nal R factor was 20.6% and Rfree was 26.5%. There was no density for residue Glu1 and the density for the ®rst nine N-terminal residues was poorly de®ned. In addition, the side chain of Asn153 was disordered and atoms beyond C were not modelled. Ile32 was modelled in two conformations. Seven well de®ned Cd atoms were identi®ed. Their presence seems to be important for protein crystallization. The re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 1.

3. Results
3.1. Overall three-dimensional structure

The crystal structure of rMUP is dominated by eight -strands forming a calyx-shaped -barrel that encloses an internal ligand-binding site (Fig. 1). The Ramachandran plot of rMUP shows that essentially all residues are in the allowed regions, with the exception of Tyr97 (9 = 68.1, 2 = À47.2 ). Tyr97 is present in a -turn that is conserved in all known lipocalin structures (Brownlow et al., 1997). In addition, two residues of the -turn are part of the most highly conserved triplet of residues in the lipocalin family, the sequence motif Thr-Asp-Tyr. In rMUP this turn is maintained by a hydrogen bond between the main-chain O atom of Tyr97 and the side chain of Arg122, a well de®ned and structurally conserved residue.
3.2. Comparisons with other structures

The crystal structure of rMUP was compared with the NMR-derived solution model and with the wtMUP crystal structure. The structural differences were evaluated using the molecular-graphics package O (Jones et al., 1991) and were

The crystal structure of rMUP presented here was determined in the Ê monoclinic space group P21. It was re®ned to 1.75 A resolution. The overall fold of both structures is very similar, with an almost perfect overlap of the backbone atoms.

mainly arise from residues located at the N- and C-termini of the protein and in the regions containing residues 59±64 and 109±111. Some of the differences can be explained by crystal contacts (Table 2). The r.m.s.d. for all atoms of the two Ê structures is 0.99 A. In Fig. 2(a) the residues involved in crystal contacts are highlighted with an arrow or a diamond depending whether the contacts are observed in the rMUP or wtMUP crystal structure. The side chain of Arg156 is the one that diverges the most between the two structures. This is probably caused by the interaction of its guanidinium group with the carbonyl group of Ser152 which is only present in the wtMUP model. The residues that make similar contacts in both structures, such as Glu18 and Glu132, have very low r.m.s.d.s both for the side-chain and the main-chain atoms. ten conformers of the NMR-derived solution structure of rMUP deposited in the PDB with the accession code 1df3 È (Lucke et al., 1999). The secondary-structure elements assigned to the structures of rMUP in the crystalline state and in solution are in good agreement. The protein scaffold formed by the -barrel and by the helices is preserved. However, small differences were observed. While the two stretches 11±16 and 28±32 appear as 310-helices (helix 310a and 310b) in the crystallographic models of rMUP and wtMUP, in the rMUP NMR-derived structures both are de®ned as -helices. Furthermore, the 310-helix d and the -strand I are not present in the solution structure. The superposition between the crystal and the solution rMUP structures was performed for each of the ten NMR conformers individually. The r.m.s.d. values for the C atoms were calculated as an average of the r.m.s.d. values for each Ê conformer, resulting in a ®nal r.m.s.d. of 1.26 A. The r.m.s.d.s Ê for the main chain and all atoms are 1.35 and 2.10 A, respectively. No major differences are observed in the position of the residues forming the binding site, namely Leu40, Leu42, Â Phe90, Ala103 and Tyr120 (Zõdek et al., 1999), providing further evidence of the rigidity of this portion of the protein. Signi®cant differences are observed in the side-chain orientations of residues Leu54, Phe56, Met69, Leu105 and Leu116 located inside the hydrophobic cavity but not involved in ligand binding. Relative positions of their side chains between the crystalline and the solution rMUP structures differ by Ê 1.3 A. In fact, many of these residues are more tightly packed and closer to the centre of the hydrophobic cavity in the NMR-derived structure compared with the corresponding residues in the crystal structure. A number of signi®cant differences in side-chain and mainchain conformation between the X-ray and solution structures are observed for residues located in the loop regions and the N- and C-termini (Fig. 2b). Other side chains with large r.m.s.d. values are located at the protein surface and contain polar or charged groups, namely Arg29, Arg39, Glu43, His46, Glu66, Ser68, Lys73, Lys94, Asn99, Glu132, Arg133, Cys138, Asn147 and Asp150, with the only exception being Ile32.

Large differences in main-chain and side-chain conformations are observed for residues 59±64 between -strands C and D. The distance between the C atoms of the crystal and the Ê NMR conformers is of approximately 3 A. In the NMR structure the CD loop is in a slightly more open conformation. It is worthwhile to point out, however, that the quality of the NMR model in this region is very poor, with an r.m.s.d. over Ê 2 A between individual conformers, indicating high ¯exibility of this region. Several signi®cant differences in side-chain positions detected between the X-ray and NMR-derived structures are

induced by crystallographic contacts. Residues Glu132 and Arg145, located at the surface of the molecule, provide an example of this. In the X-ray structure these residues form hydrogen bonds between their respective side chains (Arg145 NH1 and Glu132 OE1; Arg145 NH2 and Glu132 OE2). In the NMR structure these interactions do not exist. Residue Glu132 is pointing toward bulk solvent and Arg145 assumes different positions in each conformer. In addition to the interactions mentioned, there are a number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that are present only in the X-ray structure. For example, His46, Glu43, Lys109, Glu112, Arg133 and Asp150 interact respectively with Gln44, His57, Asp110, Lys28, Glu2 and Lys131 in the crystal, whereas in the solution structure these interactions do not occur.
3.3. Conservative residues in lipocalins

An alignment of the rMUP and wtMUP amino-acid sequences with the primary structure of eight proteins from the lipocalin family is shown in Fig. 3. A number of conserved residues can be identi®ed: Gly17, Trp19, Cys64, Thr95, Asp96, Tyr97, Arg122, Phe134 and Cys157; however, none of them belong to the ligand-binding pocket. The conservation of these residues can be associated with speci®c structural features. Gly17 is responsible for changing the direction of the chain to go from 310-helix a to -strand A. Trp19, which forms the bottom of the hydrophobic cavity and is involved in the de®nition of the binding site, has been reported to be important to stabilize the ligand inside the cavity and to protect it from the solvent (Katakura et al., 1994). Cys64 makes a disul®de bridge with Cys157 that fastens the residues of the Cterminal to the rest of the molecule. Thr95, Asp96 and Tyr97 are the residues forming the conserved -turn. The side chain of Arg122 makes hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl O atom of both Asn16 and Glu18, which seems to be important for the positioning of the eighth -strand. Finally, Phe134 is surrounded by the hydrophobic residues Ile23, Met102, Met117, Leu119, Leu137 and Ile148 and is part of a hydrophobic patch located between the -helix and the -barrel. As for the binding site, the fact that the amino acids in this region are poorly conserved can explain why these homologous proteins bind a variety of ligands with different af®nity (Novotny et al., 1985; Cavaggioni et al., 1990; Bacchini et al., 1992). However, they all possess a hydrophobic character.

A sequence alignment of ten representative members of the lipocalin protein family. The few residues that are strictly conserved in all sequences are highlighted. This alignment was performed with the program ClustalW. The sequences listed are rMUP, wtMUP, -2u-globulin (A2U), bovine -lactoglobulin (LACB_BOVIN), rat prostaglandin-h2 d-isomerase precursor (PGHD_RAT), mouse neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGLA_MOUSE), chicken quiescence speci®c protein precursor (QSP_CHICKEN), rat epidymal retinoic acid binding protein (ERBP_RAT), human complement protein c8  (CO8G_HUMAN) and olfactory protein (OLFA_RANPI).

A clear and continuous electron density is visible in the binding pocket of the crystal structure of rMUP. This is surprising, as no chemical substances of a size and shape which could ®t the observed density was used in the expression and puri®cation of rMUP. Therefore, such a compound must have been trapped and kept inside the calyx throughout the crystallization step. Unknown hydrophobic ligands trapped in the ligand-binding pockets have

previously been observed for several lipocalins (Tegoni et al., 1996; Bianchet et al., 1996; Folli et al., 2001; Vincent et al., 2001), including wtMUP (Bocskei et al., 1992). In the wtMUP structure the hydrophobic ligand was modelled as 2-sec-butyl4,5-dihydrothiazole (TZL), a natural pheromone isolated from male urine that enhances inter-male aggression (Novotny et al., 1985) and induces oestrus synchronization in females (Jemiolo et al., 1986). In the rMUP molecule studied here, the shape of electron density observed in the Fobs À Fcalc map corresponds to a ringshaped molecule (Fig. 4) reminiscent of TZL. Therefore, TZL was modelled in the hydrophobic pocket in order to compare its position and orientation to other structures. The exact chemical composition of the compound could not be judged Ê from the electron density at 1.75 A resolution. However, the Fo À Fc and 2Fo À Fc electron-density maps for the ligand are well described in shape and size by a TZL molecule. C42 and C of Phe90 are the atoms closest to the electron density found in the binding pocket. The distance between Ê them and the C9 atom of the modelled TZL is 3.5 A, while residues Leu42, Leu105 and Tyr120 are at distances between

Ê 3.5 and 4.0 A. The distances between the ligand atoms and the atoms of the protein are listed in Table 3. Interestingly, the position of the modelled ligand in the structure presented here is inverted with respect to that described by Bocskei et al. (1992). In fact, this orientation is consistent with the ligand orientation reported in the NMR Â studies of the recombinant MUP-I (Zõdek et al., 1999). Two water molecules (Wat172 and Wat235) were modelled in strong electron density in the interior of the hydrophobic pocket of rMUP. Wat172 is at a hydrogen-bonding distance from Tyr120 OH and from the main-chain carbonyl O atom of Leu40. Wat235 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Phe38. The temperature factors for Wat172 and Ê Wat235 are 18 and 22 A2, respectively. These two water molecules are also present inside the hydrophobic pocket of the wild-type structure and seem to be structurally conserved. Similar to other lipocalins such as OBP, the ligand-binding hydrophobic cavity of rMUP is rather large. Its internal volume calculated with GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991) is about Ê 491 A3, while the volume occupied by the TZL is only about Ê 120 A3. Such a difference may be related to the fact that the volatile pheromones must be released into the air and therefore there is a need for the protein to be able to modulate the conformation of the cavity.

4. Conclusions

Comparison of the present high-resolution X-ray structure of rMUP with its NMR-derived structure and with the crystallographic structure of wtMUP demonstrates that the overall fold of the protein is essentially the same. The similarity often extends to the local precision; that is, less well de®ned fragments in one structure are often also disordered in the other structure. However, there are a number of distinct differences in conformations of both the main chain and side chains of some residues. Positional differences are signi®cantly smaller between the two crystallographic models, in spite of being determined in distinct crystal forms, than between the X-ray and NMR structures or within the ensemble of NMR structures themselves. Some of these conformational differences were found to originate from the different environment found in the crystal and in solution. In the single-crystal form of the protein, differences may result from the crystallographic intermolecular interactions. It is not clear, however, whether the signi®cantly higher r.m.s.d. values observed between the X-ray and NMR structures with respect to the values obtained by comparison of the X-ray models are a consequence Figure 4 of the different protein physical state or Superposition of the residues close to the binding site of the rMUP crystallographic structure whether they re¯ect the precision of the (red) and averaged NMR structure (yellow) and the electron density (2' in the Fobs À Fcalc various structure re®nement protocols used. map) observed in the binding cavity of the crystal rMUP.

of symmetry-related molecules may `freeze' the protein in one of the possible conformational states existing in solution, different crystallographic contacts should lead to many conformational substructures `randomly' chosen from an ensemble of possible conformations represented by NMR data. In this case, however, the r.m.s.d. between X-ray structures in different crystal forms should be comparable with the r.m.s.d. within the ensemble of the structures determined by NMR. In the current study this was not observed. On the contrary, the crystal structures differ less between themselves than with respect to the NMR model. This seems to be a general trend (MacArthur et al., 1994), although the limited number of crystallographic models compared in the present study does not permit us to generalize this conclusion. A clear electron density attributable to a possible ligand was observed in the hydrophobic pocket of rMUP. The electron density, corresponding to a small ring-shaped molecule, was modelled as 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole, a natural ligand of wtMUP. The position but not the orientation of the molecule is similar to that observed in previous crystallographic study (Bocskei et al., 1992). Note added in proof: while the current paper was being reviewed, the crystal structure of recombinant MUP-I complexed with synthetic pheromones was determined (Timm et al., 2001). The position and orientation of the pheromones bound to rMUP-I is in close agreement with the position and orientation of the ligand found in the present structure.
