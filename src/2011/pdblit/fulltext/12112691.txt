ABSTRACT A hypothetical protein encoded by the gene YjeE of Haemophilus influenzae was selected as part of a structural genomics project for X-ray analysis to assist with the functional assignment. The protein is considered essential to bacteria because the gene is present in virtually all bacterial genomes but not in those of archaea or eukaryotes. The amino acid sequence shows no homology to other proteins except for the presence of the Walker A motif G-X-X-X-X-G-K-T that indicates the possibility of a nucleotide-binding protein. The YjeE protein was cloned, expressed, and the crystal structure determined by the MAD method at 1.7-Å resolution. The protein has a nucleotide-binding fold with a four-stranded parallel -sheet flanked by antiparallel -strands on each side. The topology of the -sheet is unique among P-loop proteins and has features of different families of enzymes. Crystallization of YjeE in the presence of ATP and Mg2 resulted in the structure with ADP bound in the P-loop. The ATPase activity of YjeE was confirmed by kinetic measurements. The distribution of conserved residues suggests that the protein may work as a "molecular switch" triggered by ATP hydrolysis. The phylogenetic pattern of YjeE suggests its involvement in cell wall biosynthesis. Proteins 2002; 48:220 ­226. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: ATPase; cell wall synthesis; nucleotide binding fold; structural genomics INTRODUCTION The Haemophilus influenzae genome, the first to be completely sequenced at the Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR), contains about 1800 open reading frames (ORFs).1 The function can be assigned reliably for two thirds of these putative proteins, based on homology to gene products of other genomes. The function can be only broadly described for a further 10 ­20% of the proteins, and no functional assignment is available for those remaining. These latter hypothetical proteins are the targets of a structural genomics initiative2 aimed at using the 3-D structures of the ORFs to assist in establishing their molecular and cellular functions.

Here we report the crystal structure of the hypothetical protein YjeE from Haemophilus influenzae (HI0065 in the TIGR numbering). The ORF encodes for a protein of 18 kDa molecular weight with no homology to any other protein with known structure or function. The amino acid sequence contains the Walker A motif, G40-X-X-X-X-G-KT47 (where X denotes any amino acid), found in many nucleotide-binding proteins.3 This motif is a characteristic feature of an / polypeptide fold with a parallel -sheet flanked by -helices. The consensus sequence forms the P-loop that binds the phosphates of the nucleotide. It should be noted, however, that a database search using this sequence motif gives a significant number of false positives, which do not possess the P-loop and do not bind nucleotides. So, the presence of this motif is not sufficient to define a nucleotide-binding protein. The H. influenzae YjeE protein has homologs in virtually all bacteria, but not in archaea and eukaryotes.

of amino acid sequence identity ranges between 59% for closely related proteobacteria, and 30% for distant relatives. The presence of this protein in most bacteria implies its importance for cell function, making it an interesting target for X-ray analysis. The protein was cloned and expressed and its structure determined at 1.7-Å resolution. The 3-D structure combined with the genomic analysis support the contention that the protein is an ATPase regulator of cell wall synthesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning, Expression, and Purification YjeE was cloned using genomic DNA prepared from H. influenzae strain KW20 as a template. Flanking primers were designed using the genomic DNA sequence (TIGR locus name HI0065). The DNA fragment encoding YjeE was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and subcloned into the NdeI and HindIII sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen) in frame with the sequence coding for a thrombin cleavable N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The SeMet protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain B834 (DE3) using a minimal medium containing 50 mg/L seleno-L-methionine. After induction with 1 mM IPTG, cells were grown for additional 4 h, then collected and suspended in 50 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole, after which they were lysed at 9000 psi using a French press. The extract was loaded onto an Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) and eluted with 50 mM Na-phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole. Human -thrombin (Haemtech) was added at a molar ratio thrombin/protein of 1/1000 and left overnight in 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, at 4°C. The YjeE protein was then separated from thrombin on a benzamidine column (Sigma), and the cleaved protein was separated from the intact protein on an Ni-NTA column. The degree of thrombin cleavage and the overall purity of the sample were checked with SDS PAGE. ATPase Assay ATPase activity of the pure protein was assayed by measuring the initial rate of release of inorganic phosphate by a molybdate/malachite green method.4 The reaction was carried out at 37°C in a mixture containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 1.4 M YjeE, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10-100 M ATP (Sigma). Aliquots of the reaction mixture (100 L) were removed at various times after protein addition and quenched by adding 25 L of the dye solution (0.12% malachite green in 17% sulfuric acid, 2.5% ammonium molybdate, and 0.2% Tween 20; all reagents are from Sigma). The phosphate release was monitored by measurement of absorption at 620 nm. The initial rate of hydrolysis was determined for each concentration of ATP by linear regression analysis, and the fraction of the nucleotide hydrolyzed was not allowed to exceed 20%. Crystallization and Data Collection Crystals of the apo-protein were grown at room temperature in hanging drops from a 10-mg/mL protein solution in

1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) PEG 400, and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. They belonged to the space group C2 (a 76.7, b 72.1, c 94.5 Å, 109.0°) with three protein molecules in the asymmetrical part of the unit cell. The solvent content was 48%. The crystals did not exceed 0.1 mm in their largest dimension, and diffracted to 3.2-Å resolution, sufficient to solve the structure by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) technique. X-ray data were collected at three wavelengths: 0.9792 Å (peak), 0.9795 Å (inflection point), and 0.9879 Å (remote). Crystals of the ADP complex were obtained from 24% (w/v) PEG 4000, 1 M Na acetate, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM ATP, and 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.0. These were transferred for a few seconds to a cryosolution containing 18% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 M Na acetate, and 10% (w/v) PEG 400 in the same buffer, and frozen in liquid propane. The crystals were isomorphous to those of the apo-protein. The space group was C2, with a 77.4, b 71.3, c 95.7 Å, 109.5°. All X-ray data were collected at 100 K at the IMCA-CAT beamline 17-ID at the APS (Argonne, IL) using a Mar CCD detector, and were processed with the HKL package5 (Table I). Structure Determination and Refinement The crystal structure of YjeE was solved by the MAD method using the SeMet apo-protein. Eight Se sites (out of 18 expected from the amino acid composition) were located by the Shake-and-Bake method6 and were used for phasing with the CCP4 suite.7 The initial figure of merit was 0.34 for the resolution range 15.0 ­3.2 Å (0.15 in the high-resolution shell). The initial solvent-flattened electron density map showed the molecular envelope and allowed the location of the noncrystallographic axes relating the three independent protein molecules. Three-fold averaging produced an interpretable electron density map that was used for tracing the polypeptide chain using the program O.8 The structure was refined with REFMAC9 when the high-resolution data of the ADP complex became

located at the C-edge of the parallel portion of the -sheet in a loop between the central -strand ( 1) and the following -helix. This glycine-rich fragment (P-loop) with the sequence G40-X-X-X-X-G-K-T47 (Walker A motif) is a characteristic feature of many nucleotide-binding proteins. The crystal complex with ADP displays a nucleotide associated with the P-loop. Nucleotide Binding YjeE was crystallized in the presence of ATP, AMPPNP, ADP, GTP, and GDP, with and without Mg2 . Large single crystals (0.4 0.3 0.3 mm3) appeared within days in the presence of ADP and ATP Mg2 , that is, under those conditions that allowed formation of ADP. All other combinations resulted in no crystals or much smaller crystals ( 0.1 mm for the largest dimension) forming over a longer period of time. Clearly, the presence of ADP promoted crystal formation, whereas a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP (AMPPNP), or ATP without Mg2 , as well as GTP, with or without Mg2 , did not. These data suggest that (1) the NTP-bound conformation of the protein must be significantly different from that in the NDP-bound state to prevent crystal formation and (2) the protein possesses an ATPase activity. The ATPase activity of YjeE was measured at different concentrations of the nucleotide, and steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by linear regression analysis of the initial rates of ATP hydrolysis. The values obtained were: Km 38 M, kcat 0.42 min 1. No activity was detected in the absence of Mg2 . The catalytic efficiency of YjeE (kcat/Km 180 s 1M 1) is comparable to that of DNA-binding ATPases like RecA, RadA,12 or MutS,13 and much lower than that of the HslU protein14 or hepatitis C virus helicase.15 It should be noted that many ATPases demonstrate a much higher hydrolytic activity in the presence of a substrate or an effector, such as DNA, which may also be true for YjeE. YjeE binds ADP in a manner observed in other P-loop proteins (Fig. 2). The phosphates are embraced by the P-loop and held through H-bonds to the backbone amino groups and to the hydroxyls of Thr47 and Thr48 located at the N-terminus of helix 2. The ribose forms a H-bond to the carboxyl of Glu11. This residue together with Arg138 forms a pocket for the base that stacks between the two side-chains. Met14 is at the bottom of the pocket providing a hydrophobic environment for the base. An unusual feature of YjeE with respect to the majority of the P-loop proteins is that it binds adenine in a syn conformation (Fig. 3). Only one H-bond is formed between the base and the protein, from N6 of the adenine to the backbone carbonyl of Asp136. The peptide 135­136 is in a reverse turn of the chain, connecting 5 and 6. The turn is promoted by an unfavorable conformation of Asp135 with dihedral angles: 60° and 128°. Arg138 is the only residue of the base recognition site that is conserved in all YjeE proteins with one exception: A histidine occurs at this site in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. While stacking with the base, the guanidinium group of Arg138 forms H-bonds to the carbonyls of

available. Water molecules were located in the (Fo Fc) map at the 3.5- peaks provided at least one hydrogen bond to the protein could be formed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure Description The atomic model of YjeE contains all 158 residues in each of the three protein molecules, one ADP­Mg2 ligand per monomer, one acetate ion per asymmetrical unit, and 414 solvent molecules. The His tag remains (three residues at the N-terminus) are not visible. The overall R-factor is 0.199 for all measured 48,750 reflections in the resolution range 20 ­1.7 Å, and Rfree is 0.235 for 2464 reflections. Refinement statistics are given in Table I. The Ramachandran plot shows 90% of residues in most favored regions as defined in PROCHECK.10 Two residues, Leu70 and Asp135, have unfavorable combinations of main-chain torsion angles in all independent molecules. The electron density for these two residues is clear and unambiguous. The polypeptide chain of YjeE (Fig. 1) is folded into a seven-stranded mixed -sheet with the strand order: 0-6-51-4-3-2, where 2 and 6 are antiparallel to the other strands. The -sheet is highly twisted so that -strands on the opposite ends are orthogonal to each other. Connections between -strands fold into regular -helices 1, 2, and 6 on one side of the -sheet. Connections on the other side of the sheet form short helical turns 3, 4, and 5. Reverse turns in -hairpins 2/ 3 and 5/ 6 involve residues, Gly78 and Asp135, with "forbidden" / backbone torsion angle combinations. The N-terminal amino acid residues form a -strand ( 0) next to the C-terminal -strand ( 6), so that N- and C-termini are adjacent to one another. In general, the structure of YjeE is a variant of a nucleotide-binding fold.11 The nucleotide-binding site is

the P-loop, residues 43 and 44. The proposed role of Arg138 is to assure the formation of a hydrophobic cleft for the base when phosphates are bound in the P-loop. P-loop NTPases require a divalent cation, usually Mg2 , for catalysis. A cation stabilizes the negative charge on the phosphates, and thus facilitates hydrolysis. In the present structure, a Mg2 ion is observed bound at the -phosphate of ADP (Fig. 3). It is octahedrally coordinated to a -phosphate oxygen, the hydroxyl group of Thr47 of the P-loop, the carboxylate group of Glu113, and three water molecules. The distances to the ligands lie between 2.0 and 2.3 Å. A water molecule (Wat15) occupies a position opposite from Thr47. This site corresponds to one of the

-phosphate oxygen atoms when the triphosphate is bound. Superposition of triphosphate complexes of four P-loop proteins (Protein Databank codes 121P, 1EXM, 1D2N, and 1F2U) with the structure reported here confirms this observation. Coordination of Mg2 is usually supported by the carboxylate of an aspartic acid that binds the metal directly or through a water molecule. This residue is part of the Walker B motif3 that resides in -strand 3 in the P-loop proteins [Figs. 4(b)­(d)]. In some proteins, the aspartic acid is followed by a glutamic acid that may act as a general base in catalysis. Two acidic residues are conserved in the active site of YjeE, Glu113 from 4 and Asp85 from 3. Glu113 binds Mg2 directly and Asp85 binds through a water molecule. Each of these amino acid residues may in principle play a catalytic role. However, to interact with a nucleophile attacking the -phosphate, Glu113 has to leave the coordination sphere of Mg2 , which is unlikely, and rotate around the C OC bond. In contrast, Asp85 is in a position to bind the putative nucleophile. It binds a water molecule Wat265 that in fact may be just such a nucleophile (Fig. 2).

square (RMS) deviations ranging from 3.1­ 4.1 Å over a fragment of about 100 residues. Almost all are P-loop proteins. Topologically, they are divided into 14 families (Structural Classification of Proteins database17). Half of these are kinases with five-stranded parallel -sheets with a 5-4-1-3-2 sequence for the -strands (Fig. 4). Another large group is characterized by a 5-1-4-3-2 topology for the core -sheet. This group includes only ATPases, such as F1-ATPase, helicases, DNA-binding proteins RecA and MutS, ABC transporters, and AAA proteins. An additional antiparallel C-terminal -strand ( 6) is observed next to 5 in a number of proteins, while an additional -strand following 2 ( 2a) is parallel to the core structure. A third group is characterized by a six-stranded -sheet with the -strand topology of 6-5-4-1-3-2, where 2 is antiparallel to the adjacent -strand. It includes all GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), namely elongation factors, Ras-like proteins, the Cdc42 family, and ADP-ribosylation factors. In the numbering scheme shown in Fig. 4, the P-loop follows 1 in all three groups, and the Walker B aspartate resides in 3, although the position of 3 with respect to 1 is different. YjeE does not fit either of the groups described above. There is more similarity to ATPases, although strand 2 in YjeE is opposite in direction. GTPases also have 2 "inverted" as it is in YjeE, but they lack a -strand between 1 and 3, and are different in the C-terminal region of the fold. This is why there are no G-proteins among the top 40 hits of the DALI search; all are ATPases. If one assumes that Glu113 (and not Asp85) plays a role in the "Walker B" acidic residue, then the position of the corresponding -strand ( 4) next to 1 may be considered as an argument in favor of the similarity of YjeE to the G-proteins rather than to ATPases. A unique topology of YjeE among P-loop proteins and certain similarities to both ATPases and GTPases suggest that it fills a "topological niche" and is likely to represent a separate group of P-loop proteins. The uniqueness of the YjeE topology made it a difficult case for structure prediction in the CASP IV (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction) competition.18 The only success out of 85 attempts was the model from A. Murzin's team, which correctly predicted all -strands except the N-terminal 0. Molecular Function If YjeE is an ATPase, is it related functionally to any of the known ATPases? The search is naturally limited to the P-loop proteins. There are several groups of P-loop ATPases distinguished by their function and structure: kinases (primarily nucleotide kinases, but also some other phosphotransferases), motor proteins (myosin, kinesin), DNA/RNA-binding proteins (helicases, nucleases, MutS, RecA), ABC transporters (ATP-binding cassettes of permeases), and AAA proteins (ATPases associated with various cellular activities). YjeE is unlikely to be a kinase because it lacks the binding site for an acceptor substrate, as well as a lid loop, a typical feature of kinases that shields the active site from

the solvent, assuring phosphate transfer to the substrate. Motor proteins that are primarily eukaryotic proteins can also be excluded. AAA proteins are the only ATPases that bind ATP in a syn conformation, that is, as it is observed in YjeE. One example is N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein.19 For the HslU protein, both modes of binding were observed.20 ­22 Other known ATPases bind ATP in an anti conformation. AAA proteins are defined by a conserved sequence with the consensus motif h-D-X-A-h-X-R ("h" denotes a hydrophobic residue) that spans 4 and the following loo.23 Neither an overall homology to AAA proteins nor the consensus sequence can be detected in YjeE. Another family of ATPases, ABC transporters, is characterized by the conserved signature sequence L-S-G-G-Q-[Q/ K/R]-Q-R located upstream of the Walker B motif.24 It is believed that these residues couple ATP hydrolysis in one subunit of the dimeric molecule to conformational changes in the other subunit. Again, YjeE does not have such a sequence motif, nor does it show any sign of dimerization. Concerning DNA/RNA-binding ATPases, inspection of the molecular surface and electrostatic potential calculations do not reveal positively charged clusters that might interact with the phosphate backbone of nucleic acids. However, this does not rule out a possibility of other types of interactions, for example, with nucleotide bases that often occur through aromatic amino acids. Therefore, a functional relationship between YjeE and nucleic acidbinding ATPases cannot be excluded. On the other hand, YjeE displays structural features typical for the so-called "molecular switches," such as many of the P-loop proteins.25 These proteins amplify and transfer conformational changes occurring at the active site during nucleotide hydrolysis to distal parts of the molecule. The signal is transferred to other proteins or can trigger nucleic acid binding or release. Two loops around the active site play a major role as mediators of signal transduction. One at the edge of the -sheet ( 2/ 2 in YjeE) is called switch I. In the presence of NTP, it is involved in coordination of Mg2 . Upon hydrolysis, it moves several angstroms to adopt an "open" conformation. The amino acid on top of the loop is often a threonine, whose hydroxyl group replaces a Mg2 -bound water molecule inline with a -phosphate oxygen. The corresponding loop in YjeE bears Thr67 that may fulfill this task. Switch II is a loop following the -strand proximal to the nucleotide -phosphate. Typically, this loop follows the Walker B motif. The backbone amino group at the beginning of the loop binds the -phosphate and moves away as the nucleotide is hydrolyzed. The loop often undergoes a dramatic conformational rearrangement. For example, it folds into a helix in T7 helicase-primase to promote binding of DNA.26 The corresponding region in YjeE is the loop connecting strands 3 and 4. It is the most mobile part of the structure, consistent with the absence of the -phosphate. Besides the Walker A and B motifs, switch I and switch II regions are the only parts of the sequence that are conserved in the YjeE family (Fig. 5). Taken together, the

pattern of conserved amino acid residues and the structural similarity to several classes of the P-loop proteins suggest that the protein may function as a molecular switch triggered by ATP hydrolysis. Conservation of two aromatic residues, Tyr87 and Trp114, and Arg88 in the switch II region clearly indicates their importance for protein function. Being exposed to the solvent, these residues mark a probable binding site for the putative receptor. Pairs of aromatic and basic residues are often involved in binding of nucleic acids: Aromatic rings stack with nucleotide bases whereas arginines form hydrogen bonds to the bases and phosphates. Such interactions have been observed in transcription factors,27 aminoacyl tRNA synthetases,28 and ribonucleoproteins.29 Cellular Function The search for homologous proteins in 80 complete genomes available from the ERGO database30 revealed the presence of YjeE in all bacteria except Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma. The gene is absent in archaea and eukaryote genomes. The same phylogenetic pattern is shared by a number of proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis: D-Ala-D-Ala ligase, UDP-GlcNAc enolpyruvyl transferase, UDP-GlcNAc:LPS GlcNAc transferase, UDPMurNAc dehydrogenase, UDP-MurNAc-Ala ligase, UDPMurNAc-pentapeptide ligase, and penicillin-binding proteins (transpeptidases) PBP2 and PBP3. This suggests the hypothesis that the protein may play a role in cell-wall biosynthesis. Moreover, this is probably a general role, as both gram-negative and -positive bacteria possess the protein. In support of this hypothesis is the fact that most proteobacteria, namely those that belong to subdivisions and , have a gene of MurNAc-L-Ala amidase (AmiB) immediately downstream from the YjeE ORF. The amidase is involved in recycling of peptidoglycans. Analysis of chromosomal transcription in E. coli demonstrated that AmiB forms an operon with YjeE and two other genes.31 Having the properties of a molecular switch, YjeE is likely to play a regulatory role in the cell. This can be regulation of the transport of peptidoglycan precursors (a role of an ABC transporter) or control of peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the gene level. Alternatively, it might be involved in ATP-dependent degradation of cell wall components (a role similar to HslU). More definite conclusions about the cellular function of YjeE must await further experimental data.

CONCLUSION The 3-D structure of the YjeE gene product reveals that it belongs to the P-loop family of nucleotide-binding proteins, which includes nucleotide and nucleoside kinases, various ATPases, and G-proteins. A unique topology of the -sheet does not allow us to assign YjeE to any of the described families of the P-loop proteins. However, some structural features and the distribution of conserved residues suggest that YjeE may act as a molecular switch. YjeE possesses an ATPase activity, consistent with the observation of a hydrolyzed nucleotide (ADP) in the active site. Asp85 is implicated as a general base catalyst. The reaction intermediate is stabilized through interactions with Mg2 and protein groups. The YjeE protein is present in virtually all bacteria, but not in archaea or eukaryotes. The phylogenetic pattern of YjeE suggests its involvement in cell-wall biosynthesis. As a possible ATP-dependent regulator of peptidoglycan metabolism, YjeE may be a promising target for a new antibiotics search.
