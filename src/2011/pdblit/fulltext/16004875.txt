The VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs) are highly conserved integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins implicated in diverse cellular functions, including the regulation of lipid transport and homeostasis, membrane trafficking, neurotransmitter release, stabilization of presynaptic microtubules, and the unfolded protein response. Recently, a single missense mutation within the human VAP-B gene was identified in three forms of familial motor neuron disease. In this review, we integrate results from studies of yeast, fly and mammalian VAPs that provide insight into the structural features of these proteins, the network of VAP-interacting proteins, their possible physiological functions, and their involvement in motor neuron disease. Introduction VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs) are type II integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane proteins expressed in all eukaryotic organisms [1­4]. VAPs interact with a large number of intracellular proteins (Table 1) and have been implicated in the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes, including membrane trafficking [3,5], lipid transport and metabolism [6­8], the unfolded protein response (UPR) [9,10], and microtubule organization [2,11]. These diverse functions have been described in different cell types from different organisms, and might be the result of cell-type-specific repertoires of interacting proteins, cell-type-specific metabolic requirements or ER structure, and/or VAP-isoform-specific functions and expression. VAPs are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and organs [2,4,12] and, in addition to their localization in the ER [2], have been found in a wide range of intracellular membranes, including the Golgi, the ER­Golgi intermediate compartment [5], recycling endosomes, tight junctions [13], the neuromuscular junctions [11], and the plasma membrane (PM) [14]. These diverse subcellular localizations might represent different membrane contact sites (MCSs) or ER junctions [15], because the ER membranes spread throughout the cell periphery and associate with essentially all other intracellular organelles [16]. MCSs are sites of close apposition (10­20-nm) between the ER membrane and other intracellular organelles, which have been proposed to facilitate the non-vesicular trafficking of small molecules, such as Ca2+ and lipids [15,17,18].

56 with a serine (P56S), has been identified in three forms of familial motor neuron disease (MND) [19,20]. This observation has raised questions related to the cellular functions of VAPs and the underlying mechanisms of VAP-B(P56S)-induced MNDs. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge about VAP and integrate various aspects of VAP proteins, from structure to cellular function. VAP: a conserved family of eukaryotic proteins The first VAP protein was cloned as a VAMP (also known as synaptobrevin)-associated protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen of Aplysia californica [3]. VAMPs are synaptic vesicle SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins that are required for synaptic-vesicle fusion [21]. Subsequently, two mammalian genes encoding VAP-A and VAP-B were cloned [2,4,12]. An alternative spliced isoform of VAP-B, consisting of the first 70 amino acids of VAP-B and an additional 29 amino acids, was also identified and termed VAP-C [4]; however, its expression has never been demonstrated. VAP-A and VAP-B share high (63%) sequence identity and similar primary organization, consisting of three conserved domains: an N-terminal immunoglobulin-like b-sheet that shares 22% sequence identity with the nematode major sperm protein (MSP); a variable central coiledcoil domain (CCD) that resembles the CCD repertoire found in VAMPs and other SNARE proteins [4]; and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) containing a putative dimerization motif GxxxG (Figure 1). The yeast VAP homologs, which lack both the putative dimerization motif and the CCD, have not been observed as dimers. By contrast, both VAP-A and VAP-B undergo homo- and hetero-dimerization, possibly through their TMDs [4,22]. Although protein organization varies slightly between mammalian and yeast proteins, all VAPs contain a particularly conserved 16 amino acid segment ­ the VAP consensus sequence ­ within their N-terminal MSP domain [1]. The high homology between the VAP MSP domain and the well-characterized nematode MSP, a protein that mediates amoeboid motility by forming an extensive intermeshed system of cytoskeletal filaments [23], suggests that this domain facilitates VAP oligomerization. MSP is a dimeric molecule that polymerizes to form non-polar filaments constructed from two helical subfilaments that wind around one another. These subfilaments can further interact with one another to form higher-order assemblies [24,25]. In solution, MSP spontaneously dimerizes [26],

Figure 1. Primary organization of VAP homologues. (a) Domain organization in VAPs. All VAP homologues consist of a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) and an N-terminal major sperm protein (MSP) domain, which contains the VAP consensus sequence of 16 amino acids. Metazoan VAPs exhibit a predicted coiled-coil domain (CCD) that is in a position adjacent to the TMD and which resembles the CCD of numerous SNARE proteins. The N-terminal is exposed to the cytosol. Protein sequence positions are presented according to the human VAP-B protein. (b) The VAP consensus sequence. Multiple sequence alignment of the VAP consensus sequence from representative species and the nematode MSP was generated by CLUSTAL W. Residues of high conservation between VAPs and MSP are marked with an asterisk. The conserved proline residue (boxed) at position 56 in VAP-B is substituted by serine in three forms of familial motor neuron disease (MND). This proline residue is also conserved in the nematode MSP. (c) The VAP TMD. Multiple sequence alignment of the TMD. As shown, the general sequence is poorly conserved. However, a GxxxG motif that has been shown to participate in inner-membrane protein­protein interactions is apparent in most metazoan VAPs (blue).

proteins have been shown to interact with VAPs (Table 1) [3,4,8,11,13,29­42]. These proteins can be divided into three major groups: SNAREs, viral proteins, and FFAT (double phenylalanine in an acidic tract)-motif-containing proteins [34]. The finding that VAP associates with VAMP, a synaptic vesicle SNARE that interacts with the PM proteins SNAP-25 (Synaptosomal-associated protein 25) and syntaxin [21], led to the characterization of further VAP­SNARE interactions. In vitro binding assays demonstrated the interaction of VAP-A with: Rbet1 and Rsec22, SNAREs that are involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking; the PM tSNARE protein syntaxin; and NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein) and aSNAP, cytosolic proteins that are important for SNARE function [12,36]. These interactions might reflect a possible role for VAP in membrane fusion, either by providing a scaffold for SNARE interactions at specific subcellular locations or by somehow stabilizing their interactions. Alternatively, VAPs might sequester SNAREs to specific membrane domains and thereby regulate their interactions. Although several studies support these hypotheses, the involvement of VAP proteins in membrane fusion, and the physiological roles of the VAP­SNARE interactions remain to be established. The VAP proteins were also found to interact with two nonstructural (NS) proteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV), NS5B and NS5A [31,33,35], and with the NS protein p48 of Norwalk Virus [30]. Functional studies suggest that binding of VAPs to NS5A and NS5B is essential for HCV replication, possibly by providing scaffolds in appropriate
284

membrane compartments, which facilitates the conversion of nonfunctional NS proteins to a replication-competent state [31,33]. The interactions of VAP with FFAT-motif-containing proteins have been well characterized and most extensively studied. This interaction was first described between the yeast VAP homolog Scs2p and Opi1p [34], a transcriptional regulator of phospholipid biosynthesis. Subsequently, VAPs were found to interact with various lipid-binding, lipid-sensing or lipid-transport proteins, including homologs of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) [37,38,43], homologs of ceramide transport protein (CERT) [8], and homologs of the PI/PC-transfer protein, Nir2 [29]. The FFAT motif consists of the consensus amino acid sequence EFFDAxE [34]. The FFAT-binding site was assigned to the N-terminal MSP domain in a region that is highly conserved among VAPs from yeast to mammals but not in the related MSP protein. Crystal-structure analysis of the VAP­FFAT complex revealed a 2:2 complex, in which the FFAT motif binds to a highly conserved positive patch on the surface of the VAP protein [27]. The first phenylalanine residue in the FFAT peptide binds to VAP in a hydrophobic pocket created by the aliphatic amino acid side chains of several residues. It has extensive hydrophobic van der Waals contacts with VAP-A residue Met89 and with aliphatic portions of side chains from residues Lys45, Thr47, Lys87 and Lys118. Mutagenesis of residues that are crucial for FFAT binding (such as K87D and M89D [27], K45N or T47A [44]) abolished both

the interaction of VAP with FFAT-motif-containing proteins and the ability of Scs2p to rescue the phenotype of the scs2D strain. These findings suggest that the evolutionarily conserved FFAT-binding activity of VAP proteins is crucial for their biological function. Yet, many intracellular proteins containing the FFAT motif interact with VAP, raising various questions. Do they compete with each other? Do they exhibit different binding affinities for VAP? Do they interact with a subpopulation of VAP in specific membrane compartments? Do they undergo specific post-translational modifications that affect their binding capability? In light of these questions, it is worth mentioning that the VAP-A protein only partially rescues the phenotype of the scs2D strain [44], suggesting either that Scs2p has a stronger interaction with full-length Opi1p or that Scs2p­Opi1p interaction is regulated in vivo. Cellular functions of VAPs Although VAPs have been implicated in many cellular processes, perhaps their most established function is the regulation of lipid transport and metabolism. Nevertheless, initially, VAPs were proposed to regulate membrane trafficking. Skehel et al. [3] have shown that specific antiVAP-33 antibodies injected into presynaptic neurons in Aplysia inhibit neurotransmitter release. Further in vitro transport assays showed that anti-VAP-B antibodies inhibit intra-Golgi transport, leading to the accumulation of COPI-coated vesicles [5]. Consistent with their potential role in vesicular transport, VAPs were found to interact with several SNARE proteins [12,36], and overexpression of VAP-A in L6 myoblasts prevented the export of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the cell surface in response to insulin treatment. Co-overexpression of VAMP-2, however, relieved this inhibition [14]. A potential interpretation of these results is that excess VAP-A sequesters endogenous VAMP-2, thereby preventing its binding to other SNARE molecules and its participation in the subsequent vesicle-fusion events. This hypothesis implies that the VAMP-2:VAP-A ratio is crucial for accurate trafficking of GLUT4 after insulin stimulation. Overall, these observations suggest a potential role for VAP in the regulation of membrane trafficking. Yet, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is still missing. VAPs have also been found to interact with microtubules, which play crucial roles in the maintenance and organization of cellular organelles, as well as in membrane trafficking. Interaction between VAPs and microtubules was demonstrated, albeit not well established, using in vitro binding assays and colocalization studies applying light and electron microscopy [2,11]. Studies in Drosophila showed that VAP is enriched in neuromuscular junctions, that it associates with both membranes and microtubules, and that it is required for the normal organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton in presynaptic terminals [11]. The effect of VAPs on microtubules was also observed in mammalian cells co-expressing VAP-B and its interacting Nir3 protein. Their co-expression caused a gross remodeling of the ER, and bundling of thick microtubules along the altered ER membranes [29], suggesting that Nir3 bridges VAP-B to microtubules or increases the affinity of VAP-B for microtubules. By contrast, co-expression of VAP-B with

Nir2, another Nir/rdgB protein family member that exhibits a different tissue-distribution pattern [45], induced the formation of stacked ER­membrane arrays [29]. These results indicate that the interaction of VAP with two closely related proteins induces distinct biological responses, consistent with the idea that cell-type-specific interactions contribute to the diversity of VAP cellular functions. The involvement of VAPs in the regulation of lipid transport and metabolism has been extensively studied and convincingly demonstrated in both yeast and mammals [6­8,37], whereas their role in the regulation of the UPR in mammalian cells has not been well defined (Box 1).

Box 1. The unfolded protein response in eukaryotes
The accumulation of improperly folded proteins in the ER lumen leads to adaptive responses, collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). In mammalian cells, there are three major UPR pathways, the activation of which relies on the ER stress sensors PERK (PKR-like ER protein kinase), ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) and IRE1 (Figure I). The IRE1/XBP-1 (X-box binding protein 1) (IRE1/HAC1 in yeast) pathway, the most conserved UPR pathway from yeast to mammals, is mediated by activated IRE1, which, through its endonuclease activity, initiates splicing of XBP-1 mRNA, thereby generating an active XBP-1 transcription factor. Likewise, intramembrane cleavage of ATF6 in the Golgi complex releases its cytosolic domain, which also functions as a transcription factor. Both XBP-1 and ATF6 activate genes encoding molecular chaperones and proteins involved in ER-associated degradation, thereby enhancing ER function. Activated PERK phosphorylates the translation-initiation factor eIF2a, which transiently attenuates global protein synthesis, thereby reducing the load on the ER. In addition, eIF2a phosphorylation enhances translation of ATF4, which in turn upregulates the expression of key genes important for recovery from ER stress. The Binding Ig protein (BiP) is considered to be a key regulator of these pathways. It binds to the luminal domains of these ER sensors and thereby prevents IRE1 or PERK dimerization, or prevents the transport of ATF6 to the Golgi complex. When unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, they sequester BiP and consequently activate these pathways [71,72].

Functions of VAP deduced from studies in yeast Increasing evidence from genetic, biochemical and localization studies suggests that the main function of Scs2p is the regulation of lipid metabolism and homeostasis [1,6,7] through its direct interaction with FFAT-motif-containing proteins and/or its possible lipid-sensing activity. Its involvement in the regulation of the UPR [9] (Box 1) and in telomeric silencing [46,47] has also been demonstrated in several independent studies as will be discussed below. Regulation of phospholipid metabolism The SCS2 gene was originally identified as a multicopy suppressor of inositol auxotrophy of the choline-sensitive dominant mutation CSE1 [48]. CSE1 mutants show dominant inositol auxotrophy in the presence of choline in the growth medium. In yeast, inositol auxotrophy results from defects in the expression of the INO1 gene, which encodes inositol-1-phosphate synthase and catalyzes the rate-limiting step of inositol synthesis [49]. The expression of INO1,

Trends in Cell Biology Vol.18 No.6

as with that of many other genes encoding phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, is regulated by a cis-acting promoter element, UASINO (inositol-sensitive upstream activating sequence), which is activated by a pair of transcription factors, Ino2p and Ino4p [50]. INO1 expression is repressed in the presence of inositol and choline and derepressed in their absence [51,52]. Its expression is negatively regulated by Opi1p, a basic leucine zipper and FFATmotif-containing protein [34], and is upregulated in response to inositol starvation. Analysis of SCS2-deficient mutants has further demonstrated its involvement in the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis. These mutants display low levels of INO1 expression, reduced levels of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) synthesis, and elevated phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) synthesis through the cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) pathway [7] (Figure 2a). Remarkably, disruption of genes involved in the CDP-choline pathway rescued the INO1 expression defect of the scs2D strain. These results

Figure 2. Regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. (a) Phospholipid metabolic pathways in yeast. Blue arrows mark metabolic steps that are coordinately activated by Ino2p­Ino4p and repressed by Opi1p. (b) Regulation of INO1 transcription. Transcriptional activation of INO1, as with that of other phospholipid biosynthesis enzymes (e.g. as depicted in panel (a)), requires the cis-regulatory element UASINO, which serves as a binding site for the Ino2p­Ino4p activator complex. In the presence of inositol, the Opi1p repressor suppresses INO1 transcription by binding to the DNA-bound Ino2p. Dissociation of Opi1p from Ino2p relieves its inhibitory effect and promotes transcriptional activation. This occurs upon inositol deprivation or under UPR-inducing conditions, that stimulate Hac1 synthesis (see text). It seems that the signal for repression is not inositol itself but rather PA levels. PA accumulates in the absence of inositol and stabilizes the localization of Opi1p in the ER, where it interacts with Scs2p. Upon inositol addition, PA levels decrease, and Opi1p is released from the ER and rapidly translocates to the nucleus, where it inhibits transcription. Thus, the translocation of Opi1p to and from the nucleus is crucial for INO1 transcription. Sequestering of Opi1p by Scs2p would, therefore, relieve the inhibitory effect that Opi1 has on INO1 transcription.

suggest that Scs2p resides in a signal-transduction pathway that induces derepression of the INO1 gene in response to hyperactivation of PtdCho biosynthesis [7]. The finding that Opi1p interacts directly with Scs2p through its FFAT motif [34] suggests that sequestering of Opi1p by Scs2p prevents its nuclear translocation, thereby promoting transcriptional activation of INO1 (Figure 2b). A similar mechanism was proposed to explain the role of Scs2p in the UPR [9]. Regulation of the UPR In yeast, the UPR is also activated by inositol starvation, and is regulated by Ire1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), a transmembrane ER kinase/endoribonuclease that, through its endonuclease activity, initiates non-conventional splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcription activator Hac1p (homologous to ATF/CREB 1)/Ire15p (Box 1) Hac1 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that binds directly to UPR elements in the promoters of most target genes [53]. Strikingly, multiple copies of SCS2 suppresses the inositol auxotrophic phenotype of ire15/ hac1 mutants [6], and scs2D strains show sensitivity to tunicamycin-induced UPR [1], thus demonstrating the involvement of Scs2p in the regulation of the yeast UPR. It was found that both Hac1 and Scs2p are dispensable for INO1 activation in the absence of Opi1p [54], suggesting that both are required to relieve Opi1p repression. However, they might act differently: Hac1 might promote the dissociation of Opi1p from the chromatin, whereas Scs2p might prevent its reassociation to chromatin in response to the UPR [9]. Alternatively, it could be that the Scs2p­ Opi1p and UPR­Hac1 pathways are separate, consistent with recent reports demonstrating that the UPR pathway is rapidly inactivated by inositol and is separate from the response mediated by Opi1p [55]. Lipid sensing A central question emerging from the described functions of Scs2p is how is the interaction between Scs2p and Opi1p, as well as between VAP and other FFAT proteins, regulated? One possibility is that Scs2p `senses' the membrane environment, thereby transducing local environmental changes in membrane composition into specific biological responses. These environmental changes might affect the oligomerization state and/or the ability of Scs2p to interact with specific cellular proteins. Alternatively, it could be that the FFAT proteins `sense' the membrane environment through their lipid-binding and/or lipid-sensing activity [34]. Consistent with the first hypothesis, recent studies have shown that Scs2p can bind phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PI4P) and bisphosphates (PI4,5P2) in vitro. The phosphoinositide-binding domain was assigned to the N-terminal MSP domain (amino acids 72­129) and is partially overlapped by the FFATbinding domain. It was therefore proposed that the interaction of Scs2p with FFAT proteins is regulated by the availability of phosphoinositides [56]. Accordingly, an increase in phosphoinositide levels would prevent Scs2p­Opi1p complex formation and thereby suppress further inositol production, whereas a decrease in phosphoinositides would prevent the dissociation of the

complex. Further experimental data are required to demonstrate the physiological relevance of this hypothesis and to confirm the specificity of the in vitro binding data. By contrast, it was shown that Opi1p binds phosphatidic acid (PA) on the ER and is rapidly translocated to the nucleus in response to reduced levels of PA. Given that PA is a key intermediate in PtdIns and PtdCho biosynthesis (Figure 2a), consumption of PA for PtdIns production would facilitate the dissociation of Opi1p from the ER membrane, resulting in the suppression of further inositol production [57]. Similarly, hyperactivation of the CDP-choline pathway would consume PA and suppress inositol biosynthesis. This might explain why disruption of genes involved in the CDPcholine pathway rescued the INO1 expression defect of the scs2D strain. Thus, it could be that both Scs2p and Opi1p are involved in `sensing' the membrane environment, and that their interaction is controlled by different phospholipids according to inositol availability. Telomeric silencing In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes localized in proximity to telomeres are transcriptionally silenced [58]. Deletion of SCS2 results in decreased telomeric silencing. By contrast, overexpressing SCS2 suppresses the telomeric silencing loss of mec1 mutants [46]. Mec1p is a cell cycle checkpoint protein related to the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) protein kinase family. Certain mec1 mutations or overexpression of Mec1p lead to shortened telomeres and loss of telomeric silencing [46]. Although the underlying mechanism of Scs2p function in telomeric silencing is currently unknown, its involvement in this process suggests that Scs2p plays a global role in transcription regulation. The ability of Scs2p to regulate multiple transcription pathways might be related to its specific subcellular localization, which includes the inner nuclear envelope [9]; alternatively, it might be related to its ability to oligomerize and perhaps to create a two-dimensional matrix on which membrane-associated reactions could be organized. Potential role of VAP in regulation of lipid transport at MCSs The localization of VAPs to the ER, and their ability to interact with multiple lipid-transfer, lipid-binding or lipidsensing proteins containing the FFAT motif, suggests that VAPs have a role in lipid transport at the MCSs. Indeed, Scs2p interacts with three Osh (OSBP homologue) proteins, Osh1p, Osh2p and Osh3p, and it appears to enhance their targeting to ER regions adjacent to other cellular membranes; for example, it enhances the targeting of Osh2p and Osh3p to the PM, and the targeting of Osh1p to the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ) [34]. These Osh proteins belong to a large family of sterol-transfer and/or -sensing proteins of the OSBP-related protein (ORP) family. Recent studies have shown that Osh3p is involved in sterol transfer from the PM to the ER [59], and that the cortical ER, which adheres to the PM, is markedly reduced (by 50%) in cells lacking Scs2p [60]. These observations suggest potential roles for VAP in attaching the ER to other cellular membranes and in regulating lipid transfer at these sites by interacting with lipid-transfer proteins (LTPs) containing the FFAT motif.

Review
Probably the most compelling evidence for VAP function at MCSs has emerged from studies on non-vesicular ceramide transport at the ER­Golgi MCSs in mammalian cells. The isolation of ceramide-transfer protein, CERT [61], led to extensive studies on CERT-mediated ceramide transport from the ER to the Golgi complex, and the subsequent production of sphingomyelin (SM) by SM synthase, catalyzed by SM synthase in the lumen of the trans-Golgi. CERT is a cytosolic protein that associates with the Golgi membranes through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which binds to PI4P, and with the ER membranes through its FFAT motif, which interacts with VAPs. Functional studies using semi-intact and intact cells suggest that CERT efficiently transfers ceramide from the ER to the Golgi at the ER­Golgi MCSs [61­63]. Mutations within the CERT FFAT motif impair ER-to-Golgi ceramide transport [8], suggesting that the CERT-VAP interaction is crucial for ceramide transport at the ER­Golgi MCSs. Further studies showed that 25hydroxycholesterol (25OH) enhances the interaction between VAP and CERT, and that CERT-mediated ER-to-Golgi ceramide transport is dependent on the 25OH-binding protein OSBP and on VAP [64]. These observations suggest that VAPs regulate lipid transfer at the ER­Golgi MCSs by directly binding certain lipidtransfer and/or -binding proteins, thereby controlling SM production at the trans Golgi. Given that SM and cholesterol are metabolically co-regulated and are physically associated in membrane microdomains involved in cargo sorting and signaling [65], VAPs might play a regulatory role in the metabolic interface between SM and cholesterol biosynthesis. The finding that VAPs also interact with the integral ER-membrane proteins Insig1 and Insig2 [32], ER-retention factors of the SCAP/SREB-P complex which regulates de novo cholesterol biosynthesis [66], supports this hypothesis. Nevertheless, the function(s) of VAPInsig1/2 interactions is currently unknown. VAP and MNDs The identification of a single missense mutation within the human VAP-B gene in a familial form of atypical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 8 (ALS8) [19] has triggered an increased interest in understanding the mechanism underlying VAP function. ALS8 is an autosomal dominant, slowly progressing disorder characterized by fasciculation, cramps and postural tremor. The same mutation was also identified in patients from six additional kindred but with different clinical courses, such as late-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and typical severe ALS with rapid progression [20]. All of these neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by death of motor neurons. The mutation substitutes a highly conserved proline residue at position 56 with a serine (P56S) and causes motor-neuron degeneration by an as yet unknown mechanism. Several independent studies have shown that expression of the VAPB(P56S) mutant in cultured cells results in the formation of insoluble aggregates, which were localized to the cytosol [19], non-ER compartments [10] or immobile tubular ER clusters [67]. Photobleaching experiments suggest that the VAP-B(P56S) proteins are mostly immobile in these aggregates, and ultrastructural analysis revealed that the

VAP-B(P56S) aggregates consist of tubules, which can be continuous with the ER [67]. Many human neurodegenerative disorders, such as prion maladies, and Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, are tightly linked to the aggregation, accumulation and deposition of aberrantly folded proteins [68]. It was therefore proposed that the VAP-B(P56S) mutation causes an aberrant VAP-B structure, and that its self-association induces the formation of insoluble clusters. Based on the crystal structure of the MSP domain of VAP, it is known that P56 lies within the loop connecting the d1 and d2 strands [27]. The characteristic S-shape of this loop is maintained by the cis-peptide bond conformation stabilized by the proline residue. The serine substitution breaks the cis-conformation of the peptide bond to an energetically more favorable trans-conformation, which would facilitate clustering of the P56S mutant [67]. These clusters might recruit neighboring wild type VAP-B protein, possibly through interaction of their TMDs and/ or CCDs. Recruitment of the wild type VAP-B protein into the insoluble aggregates could explain the autosomal dominant nature of the disease. Indeed, several independent studies have demonstrated the ability of the P56S mutant to induce loss of function of the wild type VAP-B. However, the interpretation of these results differed: one study proposed that the recruitment of wild type VAP-B into these aggregates inhibits its UPR-associated activity, thereby inducing motor neuron degeneration [10]; other studies suggested that the VAP-B(P56S) mutant disrupts the binding of wild type VAP-B to FFAT-motif-containing proteins, leading to abnormal lipid transport and biosynthesis and, eventually, to slow motor neuron degeneration [67]. The exceptionally large size and complex morphology of motor neurons, which probably require a high rate of lipid metabolism and well-organized lipid transport mechanisms, along with the relatively high level of VAP-B expression in motor neurons might explain the preferential vulnerability of motor neurons to VAP-B mutation [67]. Consistent with this hypothesis, dyslipidemia was found to be one of the clinical symptoms of ALS patients carrying the P56S mutation [69]. Recent studies, however, have proposed that VAP-B(P56S) affects ER stress response by attenuating the activity of the ATF6 transcription factor [70]. It is clear that further investigation of the cellular functions of the wild type VAP-B and A proteins, in addition to the P56S mutant, applying both cellular and animal models, will provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying VAP-B(P56S)-induced MNDs. Concluding remarks The diversity of VAP functions emerging from studies in different cell types and organisms is likely the result of their unique structural features and subcellular localizations. Their localization to the ER and ability to interact with multiple signaling and structural proteins might establish and/or stabilize specialized ER domains. Depending on their cellular location, these domains can locally and efficiently control diverse processes. The oligomerization of VAP and the unique properties of its MSP domain might create a platform upon which multiple signaling cascades are tightly controlled (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Potential roles of VAP at MCSs. The interaction of VAP with multiple proteins of diverse functions enables it to locally and efficiently control diverse cellular processes. Examples of such processes are schematically shown at the ER (brown)-plasma membrane (PM, pink) contact sites. Others might be relevant for different MCSs, such as the ER­Golgi (not shown). At the ER­PM MCSs, VAPs might locally regulate vesicle fusion through interaction with SNAREs, lipid transport through interaction with lipid-transfer proteins (LTPs), and membrane trafficking and/or MCS stabilization through interaction with microtubules (MTs). The inserted confocal image demonstrates that VAP-B­Myc expressed in HeLa cells is entirely localized to the ER. Bar, 10 mm.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism underlying VAP's oligomerization and its requirement for VAP's function(s) has not been experimentally addressed. Likewise, the ability of VAPs to interact with a large number of cellular proteins has been demonstrated by many protein­protein interaction assays, but the physiological significance of these interactions remains largely unknown. The interaction of VAP and FFAT proteins, however, has significantly contributed to the current view of VAPs cellular functions. Further investigation is required to better understand the underlying mechanisms of VAPs action and their involvement in human MNDs.
