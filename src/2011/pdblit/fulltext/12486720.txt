ABSTRACT Heme catalases are homotetrameric enzymes with a highly conserved complex quaternary structure, and their functional role is still not well understood. Proteus mirabilis catalase (PMC), a heme enzyme belonging to the family of NADPH-binding catalases, was efficiently overexpressed in E. coli. The recombinant catalase (rec PMC) was deficient in heme with one-third heme and two-thirds protoporphyrin IX as determined by mass spectrometry and chemical methods. This ratio was influenced by the expression conditions, but the enzyme-specific activity calculated relative to the heme content remained unchanged. The crystal structure of rec PMC was solved to a resolution of 2.0 Å, the highest resolution obtained to date with PMC. The overall structure was quite similar to that of wild-type PMC, and it is surprising that the absence of iron had no effect on the structure of the active site. Met 53 close to the essential His 54 was found less oxidized in rec PMC than in the wild-type enzyme. An acetate anion was modeled in an anionic pocket, away from the heme group but important for the enzymatic reaction. An alternate conformation observed for Arg 99 could play a role in the formation of the H-bond network connecting two symmetrical subunits of the tetramer.

Hydrogen peroxide acts both as a dangerous reactive oxygen species3­5 and as a second messenger mediating signal transduction,6 in particular for cellular fates such as proliferation and apoptosis.7 Heme catalases are homotetrameric enzymes with a high molecular weight, ranging from 200 to about 350 kDa and very conserved three-dimensional structures.8 Their common features are four heme active sites (one per subunit) deeply buried inside the molecule and accessible through a long channel with dimensions and polarity, which allow a good specificity and efficiency for small

peroxides.1 Furthermore these enzymes display complex intersubunit interactions whose role is not well understood. In particular, the long N-terminal arm of each subunit gives rise to a large number of interactions with the other three subunits. An unusual feature of this N-terminal arm is to pass through a loop formed by the wrapping domain of an adjacent subunit and participating to the heme pocket of another neighboring subunit,8 raising questions about the folding pathway of catalases.1,2 The complex quaternary structure of catalases may play a crucial role in the enzyme specificity and in the protein stability. A theoretical analysis of the kinetics of the catalatic and peroxidatic reactions demonstrates that catalase hemes are equivalent and noninteracting during catalysis.9 However, recent crystallographic data obtained with an inactive variant of catalase HPII from E. coli show that the formation of the H2O2 complex breaks the molecular symmetry of the four subunits, providing experimental support to a possible unusual type of cooperativity during enzyme catalysis.10 The authors find that structural changes occur only in two of the four subunits, although hydrogen peroxide molecules are present in virtually the same location in all four crystallographically independent subunits. However, these observations require further experimental investigations to determine whether H2O2 binding on certain subunits facilitates or prevents peroxide binding on the other subunits and whether this modifies the enzyme activity.

Wild-type Proteus mirabilis catalase (wt PMC), a NADPH-dependent catalase is very similar in structure and in amino acid sequence (53 % of strict homology) to the human enzyme.11­13 It is characterized by the shortest N-terminal arm of all the structurally known catalases.8 The gene of PMC already cloned by Andreoletti et al.14 has been successfully overexpressed in E. coli. We present here the structural characterization of the recombinant PMC (rec PMC). Because the enzyme is produced with a low-heme content, the consequences of iron depletion on the enzymatic activity are also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Purification of Catalases The katA gene of P. mirabilis catalase was cloned in the pALTER-Ex1 expression vector (Promega) generating the pALTER-Cat phagemid.14 This phagemid was used to transform E. coli JM109 DE3 strain and positive clones were checked by DNA sequencing. In pALTERCat, katA was under the dependence of a T7 promotor and the overexpression of rec PMC was achieved by growing the bacteria in Luria Bertoni nutritive medium (LB containing 12.5 g/mL tetracyclin as a selected factor for the pALTER vector) at 37°C up to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm. Catalase biosynthesis was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG overnight with a shaking rate of 200 rpm unless otherwise specified. Small volumes of growth medium (1 L) were used to analyze the effect of the induction conditions on the properties of the purified rec PMC, whereas cultures of 20 L were used to prepare large amounts of enzyme. A method based on the protocol previously described for the purification of wt PMC from P. mirabilis15 was used to purify rec PMC from E. coli. To carefully separate the forms without NADPH from those with bound NADPH, a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) step on a DEAE Ceramic HyperD column (10 1.6 cm; flow rate 5 mL/min) (BioSepra, France) replaced the previously used DEAE Sepharose column.15 The elution of the two forms of enzyme was obtained by a linear gradient of KCl, 0 ­170 mM in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5 for 30 min, interrupted by a hold at 50 mM KCl during 22 min. The bound forms of rec PMC were stripped of NADPH by a 2-h treatment in 2 M KCl at room temperature, followed by a desalting step on Centricon Plus (Amicon, Millipore, France) before a second FPLC round on the same DEAE Ceramic HyperD column. Only the form without NADPH was retained for this study. The retained purified fractions of catalase had an Rz index (ASoret/A280 nm) 1.0, and the purity of the catalase was controlled by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The yield of purified rec PMC was about 400 mg of purified enzyme for 20 L of E. coli culture. The enzyme solutions at a protein concentration of 50 mg/mL were stored at 20 °C after the addition of 8% glycerol (v/v). Wild-type PMC was purified from P. mirabilis PR as previously described.15

Determination of Catalase Concentrations, Heme and Protoporphyrin IX Content, and Catalatic Activity The concentration of monomeric catalase was estimated spectrophotometrically by using the extinction coefficient 6.55 104 M 1 cm 1 16. The protein concentration 280 of purified catalase solutions was determined by the Bradford method17 using purified wt PMC as a standard. Catalytic activities were measured spectrophotometrically by the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm of H2O2 at an initial concentration of 11 mM and expressed as the number of millimoles of H2O2 consumed per minute at 25°C.18 The heme content was determined by the pyridine hemochromogen method19 by using the difference in absorbance between 556 and 580 nm measured on the redox difference spectrum where ( red/ox)556-580 29/mM/cm and expressed relative to the number of monomers. Beside the heme group, the PMC monomer can contain other prosthetic groups such as degraded heme12 or protoporphyrin IX (this work). The determination of protoporphyrin IX content was conducted by using the formation of the catalase cyanide complex. Cyanide complexes were formed by addition of 2 mM KCN to catalase solutions (about 3 M heme) in Tris-HCl buffer 0.1 M pH 7.3 at room temperature, and the UV-visible spectra were immediately recorded. After reaction with cyanide, the spectrum was modified as previously described for wt PMC20 and other catalases21­23 with disappearance of the peak at 630 nm for the native enzyme (Fig. 1). When protoporphyrin IX was present in rec PMC, a peak remained at this wavelength after the reaction with cyanide, allowing the protoporphyrin IX present in the enzyme to be estimated (see legend to Fig. 1). Spectroscopic Measurements Optical spectra were obtained at room temperature or at a regulated temperature when mentioned, in 0.1 M TrisHCl buffer pH 7.5 in a Beckman DU 640 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a cryostat. Mass spectrometry measurements were performed by using the MALDI (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization) technique. Catalase samples were dialyzed against 10 mM acetate buffer pH 7 before mass spectrometry measurements. CW EPR spectra were recorded at low temperature (about 4°K) on an X-band EMX Bruker spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR 900 helium flow cryostat according to the experimental conditions described in Ivancich et al.24 Formation of Catalase Complexes The formation of catalase compound I was obtained by addition of approximately a single molar equivalent of peracetic acid to native enzyme (about 2 M heme) in 0.1 M Tris-HCl solution pH 7.3 at 22°C. The cyanide complex was produced by reaction of about 3 M heme catalase with an excess of cyanide (2 mM) at room temperature. The UV-visible spectra were immediately (within 1 min)

KCN (2 mM) was added to catalase solutions (about 3 M heme) in Tris-HCl buffer 0.1 M pH 7.3 at room temperature. The visible spectra (550 ­750 nm) were immediately recorded. The height of the peak at 630 nm (X1 without cyanide and X2 with cyanide) after substrating the absorption at the base of the peak (X3) gives an estimation of the protoporphyrin IX content according to the expression: (X2 X3) 100/(X1 X3) (see Materials and Methods).

recorded and remained unchanged after longer incubation periods. Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement of PMC Variants Single crystals of rec PMC without bound NADPH were grown by vapor diffusion as previously described for the wild-type enzyme.25 High-resolution data were collected from a single frozen crystal on the beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. Crystals were soaked for 30 s in a solution containing 2.8 M ammonium sulfate, 0.8 M sucrose as cryoprotecting agent, and 0.1 M Tris-maleate pH 6.5, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6222, with unit cell dimensions similar to that of wt PMC crystals. Integration of data, scaling, and processing were performed with the HKL suite.26 The structure of rec PMC was determined by molecular replacement27 using the coordinates of wt PMC without bound cofactor (Protein Data Bank accession code 2CAE)12 as search model. The initial model was subjected to rigid body, simulating annealing, positional refinement, B-group, and B-individual refinements by using the program CNS.28 Cycles of refinement followed by periodically

visual model inspections with the graphics program29 produced a high-quality model. Manual adjustments were performed as necessary, and solvent molecules were identified in the Fo-Fc electron density map at 3 level by water picking of CNS.28 The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 1E93. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Spectral Properties of Recombinant PMC The optical spectrum of rec PMC at the resting state was different from that of wt PMC [Fig. 2(A)]. The Soret band was displaced by 7 nm toward the highest wavelengths (412 nm) with an Rz index (ASoret/A280 nm) of 1.1. Furthermore, new peaks appeared at 493, 512, 554, and 574 nm,

and the peak at 630 nm was narrower than for the wild-type protein. These modifications were also observed to a lesser extent in the mutated forms of rec PMC.16 They indicated that the heme or its environment were changed in the recombinant enzyme. Further analysis of the prosthetic group was performed by MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 3). Indeed, a new dominant species (peak at 563 Da) appeared in the spectrum of rec PMC, whereas the peak corresponding to the heme group (616 Da) was clearly less important than in wt PMC. The new species, also weakly present in wt PMC, could be attributed to a protoporphyrin IX group because it corresponded to a heme group without the iron atom (56 Da) and with three more protonations of the pyrrolic nitrogen atoms. Furthermore, it matched perfectly well protoporphyrin IX standard sample (not shown). Thus, in rec PMC, an important part of heme group was replaced by protoporphyrin IX, the metabolic precursor of the heme group in vivo. The catalase heme content, measured by the pyridine hemochromogen method (see Materials and Methods) was lower with rec PMC (29%) than with wt PMC (75%) (Table I). This result was mainly explained by the replacement of the heme group by protoporphyrin IX in the protein. It is interesting that the percentage of heme found by the pyridine hemochromogen method (75% and 29% for wt

PMC and rec PMC, respectively) was somewhat lower than that deduced from the difference to 100% (95% and 40% for wt PMC and rec PMC, respectively) of the protoporphyrin content measured by the cyanide method (Table I). The difference (20% for wt PMC and 11% for rec PMC) between the values obtained by the two methods could be explained by an in situ heme degradation, as previously described in PMC or other catalases.12,20,30 It was also observed that wt PMC degraded its heme group into verdoheme, identified by mass spectrometry, in the presence of a large excess of peracetic acid and that the formation of verdoheme with rec PMC was minimal (not shown). The heme degradation, catalyzed by the enzyme during its activity, could be more important for wt PMC with a higher specific activity than for rec PMC. Catalytic Properties of rec PMC The iron deficiency of rec PMC caused by the presence of protoporphyrin IX must result in a decreased enzymatic activity. Indeed as shown on Table I, the specific catalatic activity of rec PMC (21.5 0.5 mmol of H2O2/min/mg) was about twofold lower than that of wt PMC (55.3 2.0 mmol of H2O2/min/mg). However, the specific activity of rec PMC reported relative to the heme content (6.0 0.2 mmol of H2O2/min/nmol of heme) was similar to that of wt PMC

Bacteria were always grown up to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6 ­ 0.8 before the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG as inducer, at the indicated temperature, in 1 L growth medium (LB containing 12.5 L/mL tetracyclin). b The protoporphyrin IX content was estimated by the cyanide method for purified catalases (see Materials and Methods). c The catalase content was estimated by the Bradford method from the obtained fractions of purified catalase (see Materials and Methods). d Reduced oxygenation was achieved by decreasing the shaking rate of the culture from 200 rpm (the standard conditions) to 130 rpm and by reducing the ratio "volume of growth medium/volume of recipient" from 3 to 1.3.

(6.1 0.2 mmol of H2O2/min/nmol of heme). These results could be a good indication for the absence of cooperativity in PMC if, in rec PMC with a heme content of about 30%, the tetramer contained both heme and protoporphyrin IX. When rec PMC reacted with peracetic acid, a pseudosubstrate of catalases used to produce compound I changes in the UV-visible spectrum of the resting enzyme showed the formation of compound I. This was demonstrated by a decrease in the Soret band and occurrence of a peak at 660 nm [Fig. 2(B)]. However, the additional peaks observed in the spectrum of resting rec PMC remained unchanged during the reaction. This is shown by the difference spectra between resting enzyme and compound I, which were identical for wt PMC and rec PMC [Fig. 2(C)]. These results mean that the catalytic sites carrying protoporphyrin IX were inactive and not modified by the reaction with peracetic acid. Similarly, the reaction of rec PMC with cyanide only changed the peaks attributed to the heme group (Fig. 1). In addition, the EPR spectrum (which can only visualize iron-containing monomers) of rec PMC was strictly identical to that of wt PMC either in the resting state or after compound I formation (results not shown). Furthermore, the two different forms of wt PMC compound I (so-called HpH I and LpH I) detected by EPR according to the pH of the reaction24 were also observed with rec PMC compound I, indicating that peracetic acid reacted similarly with the two types of catalase. In summary, the reactivity of the heme active sites present in rec PMC was identical to that of wt PMC, and

the presence of protoporphyrin IX did not seem to interfere with the enzyme mechanism. Effect of Overexpression Conditions of rec PMC on the Enzyme Protoporphyrin Content Several attempts were made to increase the heme content of the enzyme overexpressed in E. coli by changing the induction conditions. An estimation of the protoporphyrin IX content in purified catalases was performed by the cyanide method (see Materials and Methods). The effect of four different factors on the quality and the yield of the resulting catalases was studied: growth temperature, induction time, exogenous heme addition, and culture oxygenation (Table II). A decrease in growth temperature (from 37 to 25°C) produced a marked decrease of the protoporphyrin IX content; however, the yield in enzyme was also markedly decreased. Short induction times and addition of exogenous heme (5 M) were also effective in decreasing the protoporphyrin IX proportion. It is interesting that reduced oxygenation of bacterial cultures gave the highest heme content with a correct catalase yield. On the whole, the heme incorporation in rec PMC increased when the catalase induction was slowed down by decreasing the temperature. This could indicate that the rate of heme synthesis did not follow the catalase synthesis, which was particularly high under the T7 promoter in the pALTERCAT plasmid. This could be due to an insufficient activity of either ferrochelatase, which incorporates iron into protoporphyrin IX, or the systems of iron transport into bacteria. Under induction conditions of giving the highest

266

catalase overexpression [i.e., high oxygenation and long induction time (overnight) at 37°C], it was never possible to increase the protoporphyrin IX content to 60%. These conditions were probably not sufficient to fully arrest heme synthesis in bacteria. However, it could be also possible that the process of catalase tetramerization required a minimum of one or two heme monomers to fold the enzyme correctly. Further investigations are in progress to explore this hypothesis. NADPH Binding With rec PMC NADPH could bind rec PMC because during purification, the two enzyme forms were found in the same proportions as previously obtained for wt PMC.15 The form without bound NADPH was eluted at 50 mM KCl during the anion-exchange chromatography step on Hyper D Ceramic (see Materials and Methods), and the form with bound NADPH was eluted between 70 and 150 mM KCl during the same chromatography step. Thus, the presence of monomers without iron in the rec PMC structure did not prevent cofactor binding. Crystallographic Structure of rec PMC Structure determination and quality The crystal structure of rec PMC was determined at 2.0 Å resolution with better data quality for the highresolution shell than for the wt PMC structure previously determined at 2.2 Å.12 The crystal space group, P6222 with one subunit of the catalase molecule per asymetric unit, is the same as wt PMC (Table III). The final model contained 476 amino acids per asymmetric unit, one residue more than for the wt PMC structure, because Glu 479 of the C-terminal region could be modeled in the electron density map. The model also included one heme, one acetate, one sulfate, and 619 water molecules per asymmetric unit and presented an alternate conformation for the lateral side chain of one arginine residue (Arg 99). The first three amino acid residues (MEK) and the last five (GKDAK) were not visible in the electron density maps. Moreover, the electron density corresponding to the mobile loop (358 ­363) was not well defined and did not allow a model containing all the amino acid residues to be built. The crystallographic parameters and the refinement statistics are presented in Table III. Crystallographic Rcryst and Rfree factors were 19.9% and 21.5%, respectively, for 58,298 reflections in the resolution range between 15.0 and 2.0 Å. The Ramachandran plot indicated that the geometry of the model had 99% of amino acid residues present in energetically authorized regions (not shown). Two residues were out of these regions: Ser 196 and Asp 363. The former was also found with the same geometry in wt PMC,12 and the latter belonged to the mobile loop 358 ­ 363. The average B-factors for all atoms in the refined model were of 25.8 Å2 with specific values of 24.2, 36.6, and 19.2 Å2 at protein, water, and heme atoms, respectively. General structure of rec PMC The structure of rec PMC was very similar to that of wt PMC.12 The superimposition of the two structures gave a

root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for C atoms of 0.4 Å for all the equivalent residues. Only minor differences were observed in the N- and C-terminal portions and at the level of the poorly defined loops at residues 358 ­363 and 366 ­369, also mobile in wt PMC structure. The overall organization of rec PMC and wt PMC was also the same either for the monomer or for the tetramer. However, the improved resolution allowed more water molecules (619 for rec PMC against 129 for wt PMC) to be positioned in the structure, and a supplementary amino acid residue was observed at the end of the N-terminal arm. Active Site and Its Environment The heme environment is strongly conserved in catalase structures.1 However, the incorporation of protoporphyrin IX in rec PMC might possibly have modified the structure at the level of the active site. It is surprising that the electron density map (2Fo-Fc at 1 level) was quite well defined around the prosthetic group (Fig. 4). However, the

difference map (Fo-Fc at 3 level) calculated for an occupancy rate of one iron atom per heme presented a negative density (in dark gray on Fig. 4) at the level of the metal. This result suggested an excess of electrons in the model and confirmed the partial absence of iron in the structure. Effectively when the iron occupancy rate was lowered to about 0.5, the negative density disappeared in the electron density map. It is interesting that the electron density map (2Fo-Fc at 1 level) around the proximal tyrosine (Tyr 337) presented only one position for the tyrosine lateral chain despite the lack of iron (Fig. 5). Although a coordination bond with iron was missing, two hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of Tyr 337 and the guanidinium group of Arg 333 remained possible (see Fig. 5) as observed in wt PMC. Moreover, it was previously shown that Tyr 337 had a number of contacts with the heme group.12 All these interactions were sufficient to maintain the lateral chain of Tyr 337 in a unique conformation. In the absence of iron, the tyrosine 337 was probably protonated and shared preferentially hydrogen bonds with nitrogen atoms of pyrroles (NC and ND), respectively, 2.7 and 2.8 Å (Fig. 5). Otherwise, various contacts between amino acid residues and heme contributed to protoporphyrin binding even in the absence of iron.1,8,12 Consequently, the incorporation of protoporphyrin IX in place of heme did not modify the structural organization found around the active site, and a catalase with a majority of protoporphyrin IX as prosthetic group and with a correct structure was synthesized by bacteria. It would be impossible to obtain such a catalase in vitro because the formation would involve a protein foldingunfolding cycle to release the prosthetic group and change

heme by protoporphyrin IX. Spontaneous self-assembly of tetrameric catalase is not easily achieved even when all factors and active-site ligands are supplied1 and only a very low recovery ( 5%) of native enzyme is observed on refolding of fully unfolded monomers from bovine liver catalase.31 The protoporphyrin IX containing PMC could be a precious tool to study the effect of iron on the in vitro folding of catalases. An unusual characteristic of PMC was the oxidation of Met 53 in methionine sulfone (Met-SO2-CH3) as described in the wild-type enzyme.11 This methionine was located in the distal part of the active site, adjacent to the essential His 54 and bordering on the channel leading the peroxide substrate to the heme iron. In the structure of rec PMC, the electron density map (2Fo-Fc) around Met 53 was well defined. However, the Fo-Fc (at 3 ) difference Fourier map did not match perfectly with a sulfone modification of methionine when an occupancy rate of 1.0 on the OD2 atom of the methionine sulfone was used in the model, as shown by a negative density near the OD2 atom (Fig. 6). Refining two conformations of the methyl group of the unoxidized Met 53 at an occupancy of 0.7 with a methionine sulfone at 0.3 occupancy led to the disappearance of the negative density on the OD2 atom. Similar results were obtained when a methionine sulfoxide was modeled to replace the unoxidized Met 53. However, it is more likely to have mainly a mixture of unoxidized methionine plus methionine sulfone in the rec PMC structure. Indeed, it was known that hydrogen peroxide reversibly oxidized the thioether group of methionine into sulfoxide, which could be further irreversibly oxidized into sulfone32: MetOSOCH3 ^ MetOSOOCH3 3 MetOSO2OCH3 (1) The lack of electron density around the second oxygen atom of methionine when a sulfone modification was exclusively modeled reflected a partial oxidation of methionine. The proportion of methionine sulfone found in the rec PMC structure seems to correlate with the heme content and supports the thesis that active sites containing iron in their prosthetic group play an important role to fully oxidize the methionine. Acetate and Sulfate Anions An electron density in the form of a three-branched star was clearly observed in an anionic pocket of rec PMC located below the heme about 16 Å away from the heme iron (Fig. 7). Considering the nature and the position of the surrounding amino acids, an acetate anion appeared as a good candidate for a ligand at this position even though the presence of a carbonate anion or a glycerol could not be excluded. When an acetate anion was modeled at this location, oxygen atoms (O and OZT) of the acetate formed interactions with the NH1 atom of Arg 342, the NE2 atom of His 349, and a water molecule of the same subunit and (Wat 137), and with the NE2 of His 42 belonging to the Q-related subunit. Acetate was not present in the buffers used for the enzyme purification or crystallization but could have been introduced in vivo. In the structure of wt

All the distances are given in Å.

PMC, a water molecule (Wat 41) was described at the same location as the acetate anion of rec PMC.12 In the structure of wt PMC compound I, an extra density found at that position was interpreted as the replacement of this water molecule by an unidentified anion during the formation of reactional intermediate.33 Two acetates were also found in the Micrococcus lysodeikticus catalase structure: one at the heme active site and the other, far from the heme (9.4 Å), in the main substrate channel (PDB entry 1GWH).2,13,34 A sulfate anion was also observed in the crystal structure of rec PMC. It was located at the surface near Arg 423 on a twofold crystallographic axis between two monomers of two different tetramers. It could be the result of the high ammonium sulfate concentration (2 M) used as precipitating agent to crystallize the protein. It had already been modeled in the previous structures of wt PMC (PDB entry 2CAE) but not in other catalase structures.2,13,34,35 In Micrococcus lysodeikticus catalase,36 one sulfate ion was also found but located at the NADPH binding site (PDB entry 1GWH). Alternate Conformations of an Arginine Residue During the refinement of the model for rec PMC, it was difficult to properly place the Arg 99 in the electron density maps. Then with the improvement of electron density maps, it appeared that Arg 99 presented two possible conformations. In the map, contoured at 0.7 , the continuity of the electron density between the original and the alternate position was clearly visible (Fig. 8). Conforma-

The Fo-Fc difference electron density map using a methionine sulfone in the model was contoured at 3 . Positive electron density is in blue and negative in red. The negative density close to one of methionine sulfone oxygen atoms (OD2) suggests an excess of electrons in the model.

Fig. 7. Ball-and-stick representation of the heme and the acetate anion. The acetate anion was modeled in the anion-binding site, located at about 16 Å from iron on the proximal side of the heme.33 It formed H-bonds (dashed lines) with surrounding amino acid residues (Arg 342 and His 349 of the same subunit and His 42 of the Q-related subunit) and with water molecules (W 137 and W 458) designed as black balls.

Fig. 8. Representation of the two conformations of the Arg 99 side-chain. The 2Fo-Fc electron density map contoured at 1 was shown around the two different conformations (1 and 2) of Arg 99.

tion 1 corresponded to the geometry described by Gouet et al.12 for wt PMC. In conformation 2, the guanidinium group established H-bonds with surrounding amino acids

and water molecules (Fig. 9). The NH2 group of guanidinium was bound to the oxygen of Pro 49 carbonyl group and to two water molecules (Wat 335 and Wat 460). These water molecules were located at particular positions, on one of the twofold molecular axes (R-axis). Wat 335 and Wat 460 were also engaged in H-bonds with the amino acids of the R-related subunits. In conformation 2, the lateral chain of Arg 99 could play an important role in maintaining an H-bond network joining the two subunits. The particular head-to-tail arrangement of the R-related Pro 49 (Fig. 9) and its strict conservation in the sequences of all the heme catalases seemed to indicate an important role in the structure. Pro 49 was located at the basis of the N-terminal arm and according to Bergdoll et al.,37 it could participate in an "arm exchange" process between two subunits stabilizing the quaternary structure of the protein. This type of stabilizing interaction was found in several other proteins. The mutation of Pro to Gly, such as in dimeric bleomycin, led to a complete dissociation of the protein.37 However, in rec PMC, conformation 2 of Arg 99 could place the N-terminal arm in a correct position for oligomerization, even in the absence of Pro 49. Indeed, a Pro 49 Gly variant of PMC, obtained by point mutagenesis, was correctly folded and normally active (unpublished results). The two conformations of Arg 99 had not been observed in the previously published wt PMC structure,12 probably because of a lower resolution limit (2.2 Å). Arg 99, which is not conserved among the catalase family, except in plant catalases,38 could represent a stabilizing factor specific to PMC.

Fig. 9. Stereoview of the H-bond network around two water molecules, at the interface between two monomers, in the conformation 2 of Arginine 99. Two water molecules (W 460 and W 335) were located on the molecular R-axis between two symmetrical subunits. Their H-bond interactions (dashed lines) with the neighboring amino acid residues (Arg 99, Glu 50, and Pro 49) were represented when Arg 99 was in the conformation 2.

CONCLUSION The recombinant form of PMC was characterized by an important iron deficiency. The nature of the prosthetic group was heterogeneous and on average was made up of one-third heme and two-thirds protoporphyrin IX. The content in proporphyrin IX depended on the expression conditions, and the lack of heme did not have any influence on the specific heme reactivity. The methionine close to the essential histidine was less oxidized in rec PMC than in wt PMC, indicating that the methionine oxidation in PMC could be related to the heme-catalyzed activity on peroxide. The arrangement of the different types of monomers (with or without iron) in the tetrameric structure remains unknown. However, the strong similarity between the rec and wt PMC structures, including at the level of the active site, favored the hypothesis of properly folded irondeprived tetramers of catalase. This could lead to new insights on the respective role of metal and porphyrin in the interactions with the protein core during folding of heme proteins. It could help in the de novo design of microcatalases with potentially interesting applications (e.g., in the field of biosensors).
