The main active-site loop of the copper-binding protein azurin (a cupredoxin) has been shortened from C112TFPGH117SALM121 to C112TPH115PFM118 (the native loop from the cupredoxin amicyanin) and also to C112TPH115PM117. The Cu(II) site structure is almost unaffected by shortening, as is that of the Cu(I) center at alkaline pH in the variant with the C112TPH115PM117 loop sequence. Subtle spectroscopic differences due to alterations in the spin density distribution at the Cu(II) site can be attributed mainly to changes in the hydrogen-bonding pattern. Electron transfer is almost unaffected by the introduction of the C112TPH115PFM118 loop, but removal of the Phe residue has a sizable effect on reactivity, probably because of diminished homodimer formation. At mildly acidic pH values, the His-115 ligand protonates and dissociates from the cuprous ion, an effect that has a dramatic influence on the reactivity of cupredoxins. These studies demonstrate that the amicyanin loop adopts a conformation identical to that found in the native protein when introduced into azurin, that a shorter than naturally occurring C-terminal active-site loop can support a functional T1 copper site, that CTPHPM is the minimal loop length required for binding this ubiquitous electron transfer center, and that the length and sequence of a metal-binding loop regulates a range of structural and functional features of the active site of a metalloprotein.

umerous approaches are being used to design metal-binding sites in proteins (1), with many of these studies informed by an understanding of the basic structural requirements for biological metal centers. Metal-binding sites in proteins are commonly formed from loops, because these regions are reasonably tolerant to sequence modifications outside of the coordinating residues (1). Cupredoxins are copper-containing electron transfer (ET) proteins that provide a significant challenge for protein-design experiments (2­4) because their scaffold is thought to constrain the metal site structure (5). In the type 1 (T1) copper sites of cupredoxins (see Fig. 1), three of the four canonical ligands Cys, His, and, usually, Met are present on a loop linking the C-terminal strands of a rigid -barrel (7, 8). The fourth ligand, a His, is donated from a -strand more in the core of the fold (see Fig. 1). The lengths of the metal-binding loops in known cupredoxins range from 7 to 16 residues and have a variety of primary structures. These proteins, therefore, provide a suitable system for investigating the importance of loop length and structure for the active-site integrity of a metalloprotein. Loop-directed mutagenesis has been used to swap loops between different cupredoxins, giving sites with authentic T1 properties (8­12). In this work, we present studies that have been aimed at assessing the structural consequences of shortening the active-site loop of a cupredoxin and have determined the shortest C-terminal loop sequence required for a functional T1 copper site. The cupredoxin azurin (AZ) was carefully chosen for these studies because of its stability and ease of crystallization and its

The Cys-112, His-117, and Met-121 ligands are situated on the loop (C112TFPGH117SALM121) linking -strands 7 and 8. This loop can be replaced (11) with the sequence CTPHPFM [the shortest naturally occurring loop from amicyanin (AMI)], giving a T1 copper site with authentic properties [including a S(Cys) 3 Cu(II) ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition at 600 nm and a small hyperfine coupling constant in the EPR spectrum (17)]. The structure of the Cu(II) form of the AZAMI variant is presented here that has led to studies aimed at investigating the effect of further shortening the C-terminal ligand-containing loop.

quence C112TPH115PM117), determined by Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, is 13,564.6 Da (theoretical mass 13,565.3 Da with disulfide). The AZAMI-T variant (loop sequence C112PH114PFM117) is expressed in Escherichia coli in reasonably high amounts. This variant does not bind copper and has a very broad shoulder at 292 nm in its UV visible (vis) spectrum compared with AZ and AZAMI-F (see Fig. 5, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). This distinctive feature arises from the environment of Trp-48, and its appearance in AZAMI-T indicates incorrect folding (18). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identified a mass of 13,615 Da for AZAMI-T (theoretical mass 13,614 Da) under reducing conditions [by using Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride], which was not present in the absence of reductant. AZAMI-T does not fold correctly, giving disulfide-linked multimeric species.

The Em of AZAMI-F increases with decreasing pH, and, in the range 6.5­5, a feature with a slope of 60 mV pH is present that does not occur in the WT protein (see Fig. 3). This observation is consistent with reduction in this pH range being accompanied by the uptake of a proton at the active site (protonation of the C-terminal His-115 ligand) (21, 22, 25­29). The pH-dependence of the difference in the Em values for AZAMI-F and AZ in the pH range 7­5 was fit (for the equation used and the fit obtained, see Fig. 10, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), giving a pKa of 5.9 for His-115 in the Cu(I) protein.

using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The influence of oxidized protein concentration on the T2 1 values of active-site resonances arising from the Cu(I) protein in the WEFT spectra has been analyzed (see Fig. 11, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), yielding kese values ranging from 1.2 104 M 1 s 1 to 4 M 1 s 1. The average k 104 M 1 s 1, 1.8 10 ese value is 1.4 which is confirmed by the coalescence behavior of the Val-22 C H3 resonance in a 1:1 mixture of Cu(II) and Cu(I) proteins. The kese value for AZ under comparable conditions (40°C, pH 9.0) is 2.0 106 M 1 s 1 (see Table 1) (23), with AZAMI having similar reactivity (see Table 1) (11).
Crystal Structures of Oxidized AZAMI and AZAMI-F. The overall structures of AZAMI and AZAMI-F are very similar to that of the WT protein, as demonstrated by the fact that the C atoms superimpose with rms deviations (rmsds) of 0.43 Å and 0.54 Å [when 4AZU (15) is used, with 118 and 117 equivalent C atoms considered, respectively] and 0.54 Å and 0.70 Å [with 1JZF (16), with the same overlaid residues as for the comparisons to 4AZU]. The C atoms of AZAMI and AZAMI-F superimpose with an rmsd of 0.29 Å, when 104 equivalent C atoms are used. The positions of the -strands are virtually unchanged by the loop contractions and, of particular note, is the fact that 7 and 8 show remarkable homology. The loop linking these two -strands (see Figs. 1 and 4A) runs from the Cys-112 ligand to the coordinating Met-121 in AZ, with the sequence C112TFPGH117SALM121 (the central His-117 is also coordinated to the metal). In AZ, the loop sequence from His-117 to Met-121 forms a single turn of -helix. In AZAMI and AZAMI-F, the loop sequences are

C112TPH115PFM118 (analogous to the sequence C92TPH95PFM98 found in AMI) (30) and C112TPH115PM117, respectively (see Fig. 4A), and display no helical content. The copper-binding loop of AZAMI is almost identical to that of AMI (see Fig. 4A), except that the orientation of the Thr on the loop is different because of a hydrogen-bonding interaction of the side chain of this residue with the backbone CO of Tyr-72 in AZAMI (and AZ and AZAMI-F), whereas, in AMI, the O of the corresponding Thr-93 hydrogen bonds with the His-56 N 1 atom (see Table 3, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Significant alterations in the hydrogen-bonding pattern around the active site result from the AZAMI and AZAMI-F loop contractions (see Table 3). A number of key hydrogen bonds found in AZ are still present in AZAMI and AZAMI-F, such as those between the backbone CO of His-115 117 and the backbone NH of Met-117 118 121 and between the backbone NH of Cys-112 and the backbone CO of Met-117 118 121 and also the three interactions involving Thr-113. A hydrogen bond to the thiolate sulfur of the Cys ligand is made by the backbone amide of Asn-47 in AZ, which is preserved in AZAMI and AZAMI-F and is a conserved structural feature of all cupredoxins (7). In AZ, a hydrogen bond exists between the backbone amide of Phe-114 and the thiolate sulfur of the Cys-112 ligand. This hydrogen bond is missing in AZAMI and AZAMI-F (and AMI) because of a Pro residue being found at position 114. The backbone CO of Phe-114 makes a hydrogen bond to the backbone NH of His-117 in AZ, which is absent in the loop contraction variants but is replaced by a weak hydrogen bond (3.3 Å) between the backbone CO of Cys-112 and the backbone NH of His-115 in AZAMI [that is even weaker in AZAMI-F (3.7 Å)]. The NH of His-115 may form a weak hydrogen bond with the thiolate sulfur of Cys-112 in AZAMI (3.7 Å) that is even weaker in AZAMI-F (4.1 Å) and is not present in AZ. In summary, the number of hydrogen bonds around the active-site loop is decreased by making the AZAMI mutation and is almost identical to the number found in AMI. The hydrogen-bonding pattern is similar in AZAMI-F and AZAMI. Considering the dramatic loop contractions performed and their impact on the active-site hydrogen-bonding pattern, the Cu(II) centers of AZAMI and AZAMI-F are both remarkably similar to that found in AZ (Fig. 4A; and see Table 4, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The most significant effect is an increase in the distance to the copper from the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Gly-45 in both AZAMI and AZAMI-F. In AZ, the imidazole ring of the His-117 ligand is flanked on one side by Phe-114 and on the other by Met-13. In AZAMI and AZAMI-F, the interaction of the Met-13 side chain with His-115 is retained, but the phenyl ring on the opposite side is absent, as Phe-114 is replaced by a Pro. Although the position of the metal-coordinating N 1 atom is almost identical in all of the proteins, the overall orientation of the side chain of His-115 is quite different in AZAMI and AZAMI-F compared with AZ. There are also subtle differences between AZAMI and AZAMI-F. These alterations are most likely imposed by the different structures of the loops. The copper in the AZAMI structure is more solvent-exposed than in AZ (13­16), to a similar extent as in AMI (30). The active site of AZAMI-F appears to be slightly more buried than those of AZAMI and AMI. A water molecule occupies the space created by the removal of Phe-114 in AZAMI and AZAMI-F, which hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Gly-45. A similar interaction between a water and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Pro-52 is found in AMI (30). In AZ, AZAMI, and AZAMI-F, the N 2 of the exposed His ligand is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule (that bridges with the backbone carbonyl O of Val-43). In AZ, the hydrophobic side chain of Leu-120 sits on one side of the Met-121 ligand (the phenyl ring of Phe-15 is located on the opposite side of the thioether moiety). In AZAMI, the phenyl group of Phe-117 replaces the side chain of the Leu residue (Phe-97 in AMI), and the Met ligand is positioned between two phenyl groups.

Removal of this Phe residue results in the Pro-116 side chain of AZAMI-F, partly filling the cavity left by the deleted residue (the position of this Pro is completely different from that of Pro-96 in AMI).
The Structure of Cu(I) AZAMI-F at pH 8 and 6. Reduction of AZAMI-F at pH 8 results in very little change in structure [the C atoms superimpose on those of the Cu(II) protein with an rmsd of 0.12 Å when all equivalent C atoms are used]. At the copper site, there is very little difference, with the only significant alteration being a 0.19-Å increase in the Cu­N(His-115) bond length (see Table 4). These active-site changes upon redox interconversion are only slightly larger than those observed in AZ. The loop structure is virtually identical in both the oxidized and reduced forms. The overall structure of the reduced protein at pH 6 shows no differences from that at pH 8 (the C atoms superimpose, with an rmsd of 0.08 Å when equivalent C atoms are used). However, at the active site, dramatic alterations are observed (see Fig. 4B and Table 4). The best fit of the electron density for the copper and His-115 involves modeling two conformations for each (with 50% occupancy). One of these conformations gives an active-site geometry very similar to that for the high-pH Cu(I) form. The second conformation involves movement of His-115 away from the cuprous ion and an 180° rotation of its imidazole ring. The metal to Gly-45(O) distance increases, whereas the Cu(I)­S(Met-117) distance decreases, giving a trigonal planar Cu(I) site.

Discussion The overall structures of AZAMI and AZAMI-F are remarkably similar to that of AZ. Shortening the loop linking 7 and 8 modifies the active-site environment and dramatically decreases the number of hydrogen bonds. Key hydrogen bonds remain, and a couple of new ones, reflecting those found in AMI, are introduced. The loop structure in AZAMI is almost identical to that of AMI, indicating that the cupredoxin scaffold does not influence the arrangement of the loop, probably a consequence of the short AMI loop and the presence of Pro residues on either side of the central His ligand that constrain the structure. The active-site geometries of Cu(II) AZAMI and AZAMI-F are remarkably similar to that of AZ. The only minor modification is a lengthening of the Cu-toGly-45(O) distance, which is mainly due to movement of the copper away from this residue, resulting in its being further displaced from the plane of the three equatorial ligands. The limited, and almost identical, influence of the AZAMI and AZAMI-F mutations on the spectroscopic properties of AZ (see Table 1) indicates that these changes are not directly related to loop length and are more likely caused by alterations in the hydrogen-bonding arrangement around the active site. In particular, the AZAMI and AZAMI-F mutations both result in the removal of one of the two hydrogen bonds to the thiolate sulfur of the Cys ligand (from the NH of Phe-114, see Table 3). Similar effects are observed in the Phe114Pro AZ variant and can be attributed to increased spin density on the copper and also the axial Met ligand (the C H proton resonances exhibit larger c values in both AZAMI and AZAMIF). The shorter Cu­S(Cys-112) distance and the removal of one of the hydrogen bonds to the coordinating thiolate would be expected to increase spin density on the Cys ligand (31). The smaller gz value in AZAMI-F (and AZAMI) is more similar to that of AMI and could result from the decreased interaction of Cu(II) with the backbone carbonyl of Gly-45. The relatively small influence on the active-site structure of the introduction of the shortest naturally occurring ligand-containing loop of AMI into AZ demonstrates that a large proportion of the native loop is not actually required for a stable (and functional, see below) active site. Further shortening gives rise to smaller loop sequences than those that have evolved in cupredoxins. The properties of the AZAMI-T variant demonstrate that the Thr residue in the AZAMI loop is essential for stabilizing the active-site structure

BIOCHEMISTRY

(this observation is not restricted to only AZ, because shortening the loop in the cupredoxin plastocyanin to CPHPM failed to produce a T1 copper-binding variant), whereas the properties of the AZAMI-F show that the Phe is not required, most likely a result of the strong hydrogen bonds around the active site contributed by the backbone and side chain of the Thr residue that stabilize part of the loop structure in AZ, AMI, AZAMI, and AZAMI-F (Table 3). In contrast, the main-chain atoms of Phe-117 in AZAMI (which are removed in the AZAMI-F variant) and Phe-97 in AMI are not involved in any strong hydrogen bonds (the main chain of the corresponding Leu-120 residue in AZ is involved in two hydrogen bonds in the loop region). Thus, it appears that the Thr is essential but that the Phe is dispensable. The two Pro residues in the AMI loop appear to be necessary to enable connection of the -strands while placing the His residue in the correct location (along with the Cys and Met) to bind copper (a residue between the Thr and the His ligand is also essential for the hydrogen-bonding pattern of the former). These experiments demonstrate that CTPHPM is probably the shortest loop sequence that can both link 7 and 8 of a cupredoxin domain while also accommodating and stabilizing a T1 copper site. The question then arises as to why nature has chosen to use longer loops in all cupredoxins, and, in some cases, many more residues (up to 16) are found. This feature can be appreciated if the functional characteristics of AZAMI-F and AZAMI are considered. It is quite remarkable that the Em value, one of the most important features of an ET protein, is almost unaltered by making the AZAMI-F mutation (a slightly larger effect is seen in the AZAMI variant). The subtle geometric alterations and the different solvent accessibilities of the copper sites observed upon loop contraction would be expected to exert some influence on Em. Furthermore, the dramatic hydrogen-bonding differences should give rise to sizable alterations in Em (32). A number of other factors are important for tuning the Em of a T1 copper site, including additional attributes of their constrained active sites and the electrostatic environment of the protein (5, 32, 33). Many active-site features have been altered by the drastic loop contractions performed, and work is underway to assess their relative influence on Em. Regardless of the reasons for AZAMI-F and AZ having almost identical Ems, these studies demonstrate that the long C-terminal active-site loop of AZ is not required to give a value of 300 mV, which is of paramount importance for the redox function of this protein. The intrinsic ET reactivity of AZAMI-F is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of AZ and AZAMI. The limited changes in the active-site structure of the Cu(II) and Cu(I) forms (the latter at pH 8) indicate that an increased inner-sphere reorganization energy, which is usually very low for T1 copper sites (5, 34, 35), is not the main cause of this effect (the total reorganization energy may have increased). The diminished kese is probably due to decreased homodimer formation resulting from shortening the surface-exposed C-terminal loop (the electronic-coupling matrix element for electron self-exchange (ESE) could have decreased in AZAMI-F). The C-terminal His ligand of AZ is surrounded by a large hydrophobic patch that is the recognition site for ESE (36), and this region is influenced by the loop contractions. The ET reactivity of AZAMI is similar to that of AZ (11), and, thus, the diminished loop in this variant does not influence protein association. This observation could be due to the introduction of the Phe-117 residue in place of the hydrophobic side chains of Ala-119 and Leu-120. The removal of this Phe residue in AZAMI-F seems to have a significant impact on homodimer formation. The lower intrinsic reactivity of AZAMI-F will also influence interactions with physiological partners, although these are not known for AZ (37). Reduction under mildly acidic conditions results in the His-115 ligand of AZAMI-F protonating and dissociating from the copper. The cuprous ion moves away from the backbone carbonyl oxygen

of Gly-45 toward the thioether sulfur of Met-117. The copper ion lies almost in the plane of the Cys, Met, and His-46 ligands, i.e., has a trigonal planar geometry. This effect influences the Em of AZAMI-F [the trigonal planar geometry favors Cu(I)], and, from the pH-dependence of this parameter, a pKa of 5.9 is obtained for the His-115 ligand in the Cu(I) protein. Similar behavior has been observed in plastocyanin (25, 26), pseudoazurin (27, 28), and AMI (21, 22, 29) and is thought to have physiological relevance (26, 29). Loop mutation experiments have shown that, in most cases, lengthening the ligand-containing loop lowers the His ligand pKa (9, 10, 12, 38), whereas loop contraction increases the value (8, 11, 12). In AZ, the His-117 ligand does not protonate in the accessible pH range, and a pKa of 2 has been calculated (20). In the Cu(I) AZAMI loop-contraction variant, the pKa of His-115 is 5.5 [this pKa is lower than the value of 6.4 for His-96 in Cu(I) AMI] (21, 38). Further shortening of the loop leads to an additional increase in the pKa. The structures of AZAMI and AZAMI-F demonstrate that their active-site structures, including hydrogen-bonding patterns, are very similar, and, thus, His ligand protonation must be influenced by the length of the loop [probably an entropic effect (38, 39)]. The increase in the pKa of the His ligand upon shortening this loop results in a value closer to physiological pH and is, thus, more likely to have a functional role. Conclusions When the shorter loop of AMI is introduced into AZ, this region adopts a conformation almost identical to that found in AMI. A smaller than naturally occurring ligand-containing loop can be used to link the C-terminal -strands of a cupredoxin domain with retention of a functional T1 copper site (AZAMI-F). Surprisingly, these loop contractions have very little effect on Em. The intrinsic ET reactivity is almost unaffected by introducing the AMI loop into AZ but is decreased by two orders of magnitude when a nonnative loop is used. This lower reactivity is most likely due to alterations in the protein's hydrophobic patch that disfavor homodimer formation. Loop-shortening results in an increase in the pKa of the C-terminal His ligand and, thus, provides a way to tune this physiologically relevant effect. The sequence CTPHPM seems to be the shortest loop that can maintain both the structural integrity and the functionality of an electron-transferring biological copper site. Materials and Methods
Loop-Contraction Mutagenesis. Loop-contraction mutagenesis was

carried out by using the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis kit. pTrcAZ, a pTrc99a derivative harboring the gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa AZ, including the signal peptide, was used as the template (11). The Cys-112-to-Met-121 loop of AZ was mutated from C112TFPGH117SALM121 to C112TPH115PM117 by using the following primers: catgttcttctgcaccccgcacccgatgaagggcacc (forward) and ggtgcccttcatcgggtgcggggtgcagaagaacatg (reverse), to give AZAMI-F. The Cys-112-to-Met-121 loop of AZ was also mutated to C112PH114PFM117 by using the following primers: catgttcttctgcccgcacccgttcatgaagggcacc (forward) and ggtgcccttcatgaacgggtgcgggcagaagaacatg (reverse), to give the AZAMI-T variant. Both strands of the mutated plasmids (pTrcAZAMI-F and pTrcAZAMI-T) were sequenced to verify the mutations.
Cell Growth, Protein Isolation, and Purification. E. coli JM101

(pTrcAZAMI, pTrcAZAMI-F, and pTrcAZAMI-T) were grown and the periplasmic proteins obtained as described in ref. 11. Isolation and purification of AZAMI-F were carried out as described for AZAMI (11). Pure oxidized AZAMI-F ( 10 mg liter of cell culture) with an A280 A608 ratio of 2.0 gave a single band on a 15% SDS PAGE gel.
UV vis Spectrophotometry and Extinction Coefficients. UV vis spectra were measured at 25°C on a PerkinElmer 35 spectrophotometer. To establish molar absorption coefficients ( values), the

copper concentration was determined by using an M Series Atomic Absorption spectrometer (AAS) (Thermo Electron, Cambridge, U.K.). The protein was fully oxidized and washed with 0.5 mM EDTA to remove any adventitiously bound metal. After the excess oxidant and EDTA were removed by using ultrafiltration, a UV vis spectrum was acquired and the copper concentration determined by AAS using copper standards in the range of 0.5­2 ppm Cu(II) made from a stock standard (Aldrich). The absence of Zn(II) was verified by AAS using standards (Aldrich) in the range 0.25­1 ppm.
EPR Spectroscopy. X-band EPR spectra were recorded at on a Bruker EMX spectrometer, as described in ref. 11.

mixtures of the Cu(I):Cu(II) protein, which are upfield-shifted and, therefore, clearly resolved in the NMR spectrum and have different chemical shifts in the reduced and oxidized forms.

Protein Electrochemistry. The direct measurement of the Em of AZAMI-F was carried out at ambient temperature (22 1°C) by using an electrochemical approach described in ref. 11. The gold working electrode was modified by using either a 1 M solution of 2-diethylaminoethanethiol for the pH range 7.0­8.5 or a saturated solution of 4,4-dithiodipyridine (Aldrithiol-4) for pH 7.0. Protein Samples for 1H NMR Spectroscopy. The protein was usually

either fully reduced, fully oxidized, or contained 1:1 Cu(II):Cu(I) protein (40). The excess reductant oxidant was removed and the protein exchanged into 10, 20, or 100 mM phosphate, typically at pH* 8.0 (99.9% D2O), by using ultrafiltration (pH values quoted for deuterated solutions are uncorrected for the deuterium isotope effect and, thus, are indicated by pH*).
NMR Spectroscopy. 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a JEOL

AZAMI, Cu(II) AZAMI-F, and the reduction of Cu(II) AZAMI-F crystals are described in Table 5, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site. Detailed datacollection and processing statistics are given in Table 5. In summary, the Rmerge values for each data set were Cu(II) AZAMI, 3.9%; Cu(II) AZAMI-F, 6.0%; Cu(I) AZAMI-F (pH 6), 6.0%; and Cu(I) AZAMI-F (pH 8), 6.4%. The final refinement statistics for the structures are Cu(II) AZAMI, Rfactor 23.3% (Rfree 26.9%) for all data (29 1.61 Å), with bond length and angle rmsds of 0.006 Å and 1.35°, respectively; Cu (II) AZAMI-F, Rfactor 12.7% (Rfree 15.5%) for all data (33 1.25 Å), with bond length and angle rmsds of 0.018 Å and 1.75°, respectively; Cu (I) AZAMI-F, pH 6, Rfactor 13.9% (Rfree 17.8%) for all data (43 1.4 Å), with bond length and angle rmsds of 0.018 Å and 1.71°, respectively; and Cu (I) AZAMI-F, pH 8, Rfactor 14.0% (Rfree 19.1%) for all data (38 1.55 Å), with bond length and angle rmsds of 0.018 Å and 1.61°, respectively. The program LSQMAN (41) was used to superimpose structures and determine rmsds for C atoms. The coordinates and structure factors have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with PDB ID codes 2FTA (AZAMI), 2FT6 [Cu(II) AZAMI-F], 2FT7 [Cu(I) AZAMI-F, pH 6] and 2FT8 [Cu(I) AZAMI-F, pH 8].
