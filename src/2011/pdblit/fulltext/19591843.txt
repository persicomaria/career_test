abstract
Serine repeat antigen-5 (SERA5) is a candidate antigen for inclusion into a malaria subunit vaccine. During merozoite release and reinvasion the 120 kDa SERA5 precursor protein (P120) is processed, and a complex consisting of an N-terminal 47 kDa (P47) and a C-terminal 18 kDa (P18) processing product associates with the surface of merozoites. This complex is thought to be involved in merozoite invasion of and/or egress from host erythrocytes. Here we describe the synthesis and immunogenic properties of virosomally formulated synthetic phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)­peptide conjugates, incorporating amino acid sequence stretches from the N-terminus of Plasmodium falciparum SERA5. Choosing an appropriate sequence was crucial for the development of a peptide that elicited high titers of parasite cross-reactive antibodies in mice. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against the optimized peptide FB-23 incorporating amino acids 57­94 of SERA5 bound to both P120 and to P47. Western blotting analysis proved for the first time the presence of SERA5 P47 in sporozoites. In immunofluorescence assays, the mAbs stained SERA5 in all its predicted localizations. The virosomal formulation of peptide FB-23 is suitable for use in humans and represents a candidate component for a multi-valent malaria subunit vaccine targeting both sporozoites and blood stage parasites. # 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction

In the past 200 years since Jenner, vaccine development has been largely an empirical endeavor. However, it appears that development of vaccines against chronic infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS will

only be possible if more rational approaches based on the growing body of knowledge in immunology and parasite biology are applied. Particularly for the design of subunit vaccines, new antigen production and delivery technologies are required. Although a broad spectrum of approaches is being evaluated for subunit vaccine development against

Plasmodium falciparum malaria [41], progress toward development of an effective vaccine is still limited [16]. To circumvent problems associated with the large-scale production of correctly folded recombinant proteins and highly immunogenic and stable formulations, we are developing a universal technology platform for multi-valent subunit vaccine design [22,30,32,34,37], which is based on synthetic peptides delivered on the surface of immunopotentiating reconstituted influenza virosomes (IRIVs). IRIVs are spherical, unilammelar vesicles, prepared by detergent removal from a mixture of natural and synthetic phospholipids and influenza surface glycoproteins. The influenza membrane glycoprotein hemagglutinin is a fusion-inducing component, inducing antigen uptake by immunocompetent cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. IRIVs are a universal antigen-delivery system for multi-valent subunit vaccines, since antigens can be either attached to their surface to elicit CD4 T cell and antibody responses, or encapsulated in their lumen to elicit CD8 T cell responses. They have an excellent safety profile and are already registered for human use [43]. One of the target antigens for inclusion into a malaria vaccine is the serine repeat antigen-5 (SERA5). SERA5 belongs to a gene family comprising eight members (SERA1­8) on chromosome 2 and one (SERA9) on chromosome 9 in P. falciparum [15,17]. SERA5 expression is abundant and found in the trophozoite and schizont stages of parasite blood stage development, as well as in salivary gland sporozoites [1,12,25]. Accompanied by the removal of a 22amino acid signal sequence, the SERA5 precursor protein (120 kDa) is secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) space [6]. SERA5 is the major PV protein during the schizont stage and is also found on the surface of the developing merozoites [4,8,12,23,26,35]. During merozoite release and reinvasion a fraction of SERA5 is proteolytically processed into a 47 kDa N-terminal (P47), a 56 kDa central (P56), and an 18 kDa C-terminal domain (P18) [5­7,9]. P56 is further processed into two fragments with a size of 50 kDa and 6 kDa (P50 and P6) [6]. A complex of P47 and P18 formed through disulfide bonds associates with the surface of merozoites, whereas P50 is released into the culture medium after merozoite release [26]. The central domain of recombinantly expressed SERA5 (P50) has been shown to possess proteolytic activity, which may represent a functional activity of SERA5 involved in merozoites invasion of and/or egress from host erythrocytes [18]. Antibodies against P47 have been associated with protection against severe malaria in children under 5 years [33] and a recombinantly expressed fragment of the same sequence has been shown to induce protective immune responses in Aotus monkeys [11,19,20]. In this report we describe the immunological characterization of synthetic peptides derived from the P47 sequence of SERA5. Mice were immunized with virosomal formulations of the peptides to determine their immunogenicity and in particular their capacity to elicit P. falciparum parasite crossreactive antibodies. Comparative immunological analysis led to the design of the optimized peptide FB-23, which induces high titers of parasite-binding antibodies in a virosomal vaccine formulation.

Materials and methods
Synthesis of peptides Mimetic FB-15

The peptide was synthesized on Rink Amide MBHA resin (0.66 mmol/g, Novabiochem, Switzerland) using an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer and Fmoc chemistry. Couplings were performed using 4-fold excess (1 mmol) of each standard protected amino acid with extended coupling cycles. The synthesis was started with 380 mg (0.25 mmol) of resin. Following chain assembly on the resin, PE-Succ (see below) was coupled to the free N-terminus of the peptide on the resin, using a solution of PE-Succ-OH (3 eq.), HATU (3 eq.), HOAt (3 eq.) and iPr2EtN (8 eq.) in DMF, with agitation overnight at RT. The resin was then filtered and washed with DMF (3 ml Â 5 ml), CH2Cl2 (3 ml Â 5 ml), and MeOH (3 ml Â 5 ml). The mimetic was then cleaved from the resin and deprotected by treatment with CF3COOH/i-Pr3SiH/H2O (95:2.5:2.5) for 3 h at RT. After filtration and concentration in vacuo, the peptide was precipitated with cold Et2O, and washed three times with cold Et2O. Purification of the crude product by semi-preparative reverse phase-HPLC (C4 column: ° Vydac 214TP1010; 10 mm, 300 A, 10 mm Â 250 mm; gradient from 20 to 100% EtOH + 0.1% TFA in 15 min) gave FB-15. MALDI-TOF-MS (m/z Æ0.1%): 6048 [M+H]+, 3028 [M+2H]2+ (calc. MW: 6045.5 g/mol).

2.1.2.

Mimetic FB-19

This was synthesized in the same way as for FB-15, except that two pseudoproline (CPro) building blocks were used (Novabiochem, Switzerland), Fmoc-ValSer(CMe,MePro)-OH at positions Val(19)-Ser(20) and Val(24)-Ser(25). ESI-MS (m/z Æ0.01%): 1526.8 [M+3H]3+, 1145.4 [M+4H]4+ (calc. MW: 4578.0 g/mol).

2.1.3.

Mimetic FB-23

This was synthesized in the same way as for FB-15, except that five pseudoproline (CPro) building blocks were used (Novabiochem, Switzerland); Fmoc-ValSer(CMe,MePro)-OH at positions Val(17)-Ser(18), Val(23)-Ser(24) and Val(28)-Ser(29), and Fmoc-SerSer(CMe,MePro)-OH at Ser(10)-Ser(11) and Ser(34)Ser(35). MALDI-TOF-MS (m/z Æ0.1%): 5089.4 [M+H]+ (calc. MW: 5090.7 g/mol).

2.1.4.

Mimetic DB-12

This was synthesized in the same way as for FB-15. ESI-MS (m/ z Æ0.01%): 1563.8 [M+2H]2+, 3126.7 [M+H]+ (calc. MW: 3125.4 g/ mol).

2.1.5.

Cyclic mimetics DB-11, -14, -16 and -20

These mimetics were synthesized in the following seven-step procedure: Step 1. The linear peptide sequence was assembled by solid phase peptide synthesis, using Fmoc chemistry and chlorotrityl chloride resin, with an initial loading of 0.2­0.3 mmol/g. N(a)-Fmoc(2S,4S)-4-(Alloc)aminoproline ((2S,4S)-allyloxycarbonyl-4-amino-1-Fmoc-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid) was incorporated in place of the desired proline. At the end of the chain assembly,

the N-terminal Fmoc protecting group was not removed. The Alloc protecting group was removed by stirring the resin-bound peptide with Pd(PPh3)4 and PhSiH3 in CH2Cl2 for 3 h at RT under Ar. The resin was then filtered and washed four times with DMF and three times with CH2Cl2. The peptide chain was cleaved from the resin by stirring in a solution of 0.6% CF3COOH in CH2Cl2 for 1 h at RT. The solution was washed with brine and then evaporated to dryness. For cyclization, the peptide chain from above was treated with HATU and HOAt (each 6 eq.) and iPr2EtN (12 eq.) in dry DMF (peptide concentration 1 mg/ml) for 72 h at RT. The DMF was then removed under vacuo, and the residue was redissolved in CH2Cl2 and washed twice with brine. The solution was then dried over Na2SO4 and dried under vacuo. To remove the Fmoc-group, the peptide from above was dissolved in a solution of piperidine (20%) in DMF and stirred for 1 h at RT. The solution was then dried under vacuo and the desired product was purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC. For coupling to the phospholipid, PE-Succ-OH was made be reacting 1,3-dipalmitoyl-glycero-2-phospho-ethanolamine (Bachem, Switzerland) (1 g, 1.45 mmol) in CHCl3/MeOH (9:1, 100 ml) with succinic anhydride (203 mg, 2.03 mmol, 1.4 eq.) in CH2Cl2 (100 ml) and Et3N (600 ml, 4.31 mmol, 3 eq.). The solution was stirred for 5 h at RT. Then CHCl3 (100 ml) and 0.02 M citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer (100 ml, pH 5.5) were added and the aqueous phase was extracted with CHCl3. The combined organic phases were separated, dried over Na2SO4 and solvent evaporated to give the product PE-SuccOH (1.12 g, 98% yield). ESI-MS (m/z Æ0.01%): 790.5 [M+H]+, 394.7 [M+2H]2+. The cyclic peptide was then coupled to PE-Succ-OH in DMF with HATU (3 eq.) HOAt (3 eq.) and Et3N (6 eq.). After stirring at RT for 72 h, the DMF was removed under vacuo, the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 and washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness. For deprotection, the product from above was dissolved in CF3COOH containing H2O (2.5%, v/v) and iPr3SiH (2.5%) and stirred at RT for 1 h. The solution was then evaporated to dryness under vacuo, and the product was purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC. The product was obtained in >95% purity and was characterized by mass spectrometry. DB-11, ESIMS (m/z Æ0.01%): 1562.7 [M+2H]2+, 1042.3 [M+3H]3+ (calc. MW: 3123.4 g/mol); DB-14, ESI-ES (m/z Æ0.01%): 3125.1 [M+H]+, 1563 [M+2H]2+, 1042 [M+3H]3+ (calc. MW: 3123.4 g/mol); DB-16, ESI-ES (m/z Æ0.01%): 3124.4 [M+H]+, 1563 [M+2H]2+, 1042 [M+3H]3+ (calc. MW: 3123.4 g/mol); DB-20, ESI-ES (m/z Æ0.01%): 3124.6 [M+H]+, 1562.8 [M+2H]2+, 1042.2 [M+3H]3+ (calc. MW: 3123.4 g/mol).

Preparation of peptide-loaded virosomes

For the preparation of IRIV loaded with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)­peptide conjugates, a solution of purified Influenza A/Singapore hemagglutinin (4 mg) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 Â g and the pellet was dissolved in PBS (1.33 ml) containing 100 mM octaethyleneglycolmonodecylether (PBS-OEG). Peptide­PE conjugates (4 mg), phosphatidylcholine (32 mg; Lipoid, Ludwigshafen, Germany) and PE (6 mg) were dissolved in a total volume of 2.66 ml of PBS-OEG. The phospholipid and the hemagglutinin solutions were mixed and sonicated for 1 min. This solution was then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 Â g and the supernatant was filtered (0.22 mm) under sterile conditions. Virosomes were then formed by detergent removal using BioRad SM BioBeads (BioRad, Glattbrugg, Switzerland).

Animal studies

All procedures involving living animals were performed in accordance with the Rules and Regulations for the Protection of Animal Rights (Tierschutzverordnung) of the Swiss Bundesamt fur Veterinarwesen. ¨ ¨

2.3.1.

Mouse immunogenicity studies

BALB/c mice were pre-immunized intramuscularly with 0.1 mg of the whole influenza virus vaccine Inflexal. Three weeks later (day 0) they were immunized with PE­peptide conjugate-loaded IRIVs (containing 10 mg PE­peptide). Booster immunizations were given at day 21 and 35. Blood was collected before each immunization and 2 weeks after the final injection.

2.4.

Generation of hybridomas and production of mAbs

Hybridomas were generated from spleen cells of mice 3 days after an intravenous booster immunization with FB-23 loaded IRIVs using PAI mouse myeloma cells as a fusion partner. Hybrids were selected in HAT medium and cells that secreted anti-FB-23 mAbs were identified by ELISA. For large-scale mAb production, hybridoma cell lines were cultured in 175 cm2 flasks and mAbs were purified by protein A (Protein A SepharoseTM CL4B, Piscataway, NJ). Purified mAbs were dialyzed against PBS, aliquoted and stored at À80 8C. Generation of anti-P. falciparum sporozoite mAbs has been described previously [40].

ELISA

Sequence from P. falciparum isolate UF-5 (Indonesia); accession BAA78509 [27].

ELISA analyses with peptide­PE conjugates were performed essentially as described before [32]. Briefly, PolysorpTM plates (Nunc, Fisher Scientific, Wohlen, Switzerland) were coated overnight at 4 8C with 100 ml of a 10 mg/ml solution of FB-23 in PBS (pH 7.2). After three washings with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 wells were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS for 30 min at 37 8C and washed three times again. Plates were then incubated with serial dilutions of anti-peptide mouse serum or anti-peptide mAbs in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.5% milk powder for 2 h at 37 8C. After washing, plates were

incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Fc-specific) antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at 37 8C. After washing again, phosphatase substrate solution (1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in a pH 9.8 buffer solution containing 10% [v/v] diethanolamine and 0.02% MgCl2) was added and the plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature until the colorimetric reaction had progressed sufficiently. The optical density was measured at 405 nm on a Titertek Multiscan MCC/340 reader (LAbsystems, Helsinki, Finland).

2.6.

Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

For IFAs with blood stage parasites 5 ml infected erythrocytes from an in vitro culture [28] were used to prepare thin smears. These were fixed in 50/50 acetone/methanol (v/v) for 2 min at À20 8C. Alternatively, multiwell immunofluorescence microscopy slides (Flow Laboratories, Baar, Switzerland) were treated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min and washed five times with PBS. Erythrocytes from in vitro cultures [28] of P. falciparum strain K1 with a parasitemia between 5 and 10% were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in RPMI basal salts medium (Gibco-BRL, Basel, Switzerland) and 2 volumes of a solution containing 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100. From this cell suspension, 30 ml was added to each well, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and washed five times with PBS. Blocking was done for 15 min at room temperature with 50 ml blocking solution containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Immunostaining was performed by incubating the wells with 25 ml of an appropriate mAb dilution in blocking solution in a humid chamber for 1 h at room temperature. After five washes with blocking solution 25 ml of 5 mg/ml cyanine dye (Cy3)-conjugated affinity-pure F(ab0 )2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA), diluted in blocking solution containing 0.01 mg/ml Hoechst dye no. 33,256 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, wells were washed five times with PBS, mounted with mounting solution (90% [v/v] glycerol containing 0.1 M Tris­Cl, pH 8.0 and 2 mg/ ml o-phenylenediamine) and covered with a coverslip. Antibody binding and DNA staining were assessed by fluorescence microscopy on a Leitz Dialux 20 or a Leica DM5000 fluorescence microscope and documented with a Leica DC200 digital camera system. For IFAs with sporozoites, air-dried unfixed P. falciparum (strain NF54) salivary gland sporozoites attached to microscope glass slides were blocked and incubated with mAbs as described above.

pelleted parasites were resuspended in 3 volumes of PBS and stored at À80 8C until further use. A total of 50 ml of parasite lysate was solubilized in an equal volume of 2Â loading buffer (1.7 ml of 0.5 M Tris­HCl [pH 6.8], 2 ml of glycerol, 4.5 ml of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 ml of b-mercaptoethanol, 0.8 ml of bromophenol blue [0.3%, w/v]) and heated to 95 8C for 10 min. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gel. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Protran1 Nitrocellulose, BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) by semi-dry blotting. Blots were blocked with PBS containing 5% milk powder and 0.1% Tween-20 over night at 4 8C. The filter was cut into strips and incubated with appropriate dilutions of mAbs in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Filter strips were then washed three times for 10 min in blocking buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with alkaline peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) diluted 1:30,000 in blocking buffer. After washing again, blots were developed using ECLTM Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England) to visualize bands. For Western blots with sporozoites, 100 ml of an Anopheles stephensi salivary gland lysate containing about 60,000 P. falciparum sporozoites (strain NF54) were diluted with an equal volume of 2Â loading buffer and heated to 95 8C for 10 min. Proteins were separated, transferred and incubated with mAbs as described above.

2.8.

Parasite culture

P. falciparum strain K1 was cultured essentially as described previously [28]. The culture medium was supplemented with 0.5% AlbuMAX (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland) as a substitute for human serum [10]. Serogroup A erythrocytes for passages were obtained from the Swiss Red Cross (Basel, Switzerland).

2.9.

Blood-stage parasite synchronization

Parasites were synchronized using D-sorbitol, as described before [24]. Merozoites were isolated after parasite synchronization using MACS sorting [42] and continued parasite culture until schizont rupture. After rupture parasites were again passed through a MACS column and the flow through containing merozoites was collected.

In vitro growth inhibition assays

2.7.

SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting

In vitro growth inhibition assays were performed as described before [32]. Briefly, blood stage parasites were synchronized and cultivated in triplicates in the presence of anti-FB-23 mAbs or an equal volume of PBS. Percent inhibition was calculated relative to the PBS control.

Blood stage parasite lysates were prepared essentially as described previously [28] by saponin lysis of P. falciparum K1infected erythrocytes. In brief, cultured parasites were washed once with PBS. Pelleted infected red blood cells were lysed by mixing with a large volume (adjusted to 5% hematocrit) of 0.015% (w/v) saponin in 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Finally, the

Results
Design and synthesis of peptides

Previous studies by Fox et al. [13] indicated that a parasite inhibitory epitope exists between residues 17­73 of SERA5,

peptides 28 (2007) 2051­2060

2055

possibly in the region 57­73. Based on these results, we first prepared the lipopeptide FB-15 (Fig. 1), which contains residues 17­73 linked through its N-terminus and a succinate linker to an isomer of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The shorter mimetic DB-12 contains only the residues 48­73, again linked to the phospholipid. The N-terminal region of SERA5 contains several proline residues within motifs that appear to have a significant propensity to form turn-like conformations. At present no 3D structural information is available for the protein. Nevertheless, a small library of constrained peptidomimetics was synthesized, in an attempt to stabilize turn structures and so improve the ability of the mimetics to elicit antibodies that cross-react with the native protein. These constrained mimetics (DB-11, -14, -16 and -20 (Fig. 1)) contain an amide link between the C-terminus and the 4-amino group of (2S,4S)4-aminoproline, which was introduced into the sequence in place of Pro. Due to non-satisfactory immunological properties of these peptides (see below) new sequences had to be evaluated. Other studies by Fox et al. [14] also suggested that inhibitory epitopes might be located in a larger stretch extended towards the C-terminus between residues 17­165. Based on this report and the evaluation of the immunological properties of the preceding peptides we prepared the mimetic FB-19 with an extended C-terminus. However, since this molecule was poorly water soluble, we also prepared mimetic FB-23, which showed much improved solubility.

3.2.

Immunogenicity of SERA5-derived peptides

BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 mg doses of virosomally formulated synthetic peptides comprising aa 48­73, aa 17­73 or aa 57­94 of P. falciparum SERA5 (Fig. 1). Sera taken prior to the first and 2 weeks after the third immunization were analyzed for the development of (1) peptide specific IgG in peptide ELISA, (2) SERA5-binding IgG in Western blotting with P. falciparum blood stage lysate and (3) parasite cross-reactive IgG in IFA with in vitro cultivated blood stage parasites. All peptides tested were immunogenic, but most of them elicited only in part of the animals low titers of IgG that cross-reacted with schizonts in IFA or Western blotting (Table 1). Only the C-terminally extended peptide FB-19 (aa 57­94) elicited IFA and Western blotting titers !100 in all immunized mice. Since solubility of FB-19 was low, it was modified by addition of four lysine residues to yield a better soluble derivative. This easier to produce and to formulate optimized peptide, designated FB-23, had immunological properties comparable to those of FB-19. Sera from all ten FB-23 immunized mice were parasite cross-reactive both in IFA and Western blotting analysis (Table 1). The mean IFA titer (2512 Æ 4846) was 10- to 100-fold higher than titers elicited by immunization with the peptides incorporating aa 48­73 or aa 17­73 of SERA5.

antibody response. Five cell lines producing mAbs (designated SO10.1­SO10.5) binding to FB-23 in ELISA were obtained from a FB-23 immunized BALB/c mouse. While all five mAbs were of the IgG1 isotype and bound to the two peptides (FB-19 and FB23) that comprised aa 57­94, they differed in cross-reactivity with FB-15 (aa 17­73) in ELISA (Table 2). MAb SO10.3 showed strong, mAbs SO10.1 and SO10.4 weak and mAbs SO10.2 and SO10.5 no cross-reactivity with peptide FB-15. None of the mAbs was positive in ELISA with the peptides comprising aa 48­73 of SERA5.

Detection of SERA5 in P. falciparum parasites

To test whether the mAbs recognized full-length (120 kDa) SERA5, as well as its N-terminal 47 kDa processing product, we performed Western blotting analyses with lysates of synchronized in vitro cultivated P. falciparum blood stage parasites. Samples were taken at different time-points from the synchronized cultures, thus representing ring, trophozoite or schizont stages. In addition, free merozoites isolated by MACS sorting were analyzed. Full-length SERA5 was stained by four of the five mAbs in Western blotting (Table 2). While ring stages were negative, first traces of full-length SERA5 became detectable in the lysates corresponding to the late ring/early trophozoite stages taken from the cultures at 18 and 24 h (Fig. 2). Only in the merozoite lysate both the full-length 120 kDa and the processed 47 kDa

fragment were detectable by all four Western blotting positive mAbs (Fig. 2). In Western blotting analysis with a sporozoite lysate only the processed P47 domain, but no full-length SERA5 was detected with SO10.1 and SO10.4 (Fig. 3). The other three mAbs did not detect any of the SERA5 associated bands. Recognition of SERA5 in different sub-cellular localizations during parasite blood stage development was analyzed by IFA with the same synchronized parasite cultures as used for preparation of lysates for the Western blotting experiments. All five mAbs, including the Western blotting negative mAb SO10.2, yielded comparable results: In trophozoites a ring around the parasites was stained (Fig. 4A) whereas a staining pattern characteristic for antigens associated with the cell membrane of the parasite was observed with segmented schizonts (Fig. 4B) and free merozoites (Fig. 4C). No SERA5-specific staining of sporozoites was obtained in IFA.

In vitro growth inhibition

In vitro growth inhibition assays with blood stage parasites were performed to assess a parasite inhibitory effect of the anti-FB-23 mAbs. As expected, no growth inhibition was found in this test system with any of the mAbs tested (Fig. 5). Previous reports have shown that anti-SERA5 antibodies have no direct effect upon merozoite invasion but can cooperate

Discussion

For our approach to develop a synthetic peptide-based multivalent malaria vaccine [30,32,36], we employ an iterative selection process to design peptide structures with optimal immunogenic properties. Virosomally formulated candidate antigens are used to immunize mice and a biologically relevant test system, semi-quantitative detection of parasite-binding antibodies by IFA, is used to guide step-wise selection of suitable structures [22,30,32,37]. As described here for all SERA5-derived peptides tested, virosomally formulated peptide formulations are practically always immunogenic and elicit peptide-reactive IgG responses in ELISA. However, only a minority of parasite antigen derived peptides are able to consistently induce parasite cross-reactive antibodies. In some cases conformational stabilization of peptide chains by intramolecular cross-linking is required for the design of compounds that structurally resemble surface loops of the native target protein response [30,36]. In other cases, as

demonstrated here for SERA5-derived peptides, choice of an appropriate sequence stretch may be sufficient [32]. Evidence that virosomally formulated linear peptides can elicit antibodies against conformational epitopes [32] indicates, that linear peptides may be able to acquire a native-like conformation, in particular, when they are delivered structurally undisturbed on the surface of virosomes in the context of a phospholipid bilayer. In contrast, delivery of peptide antigens adsorbed to alum or other adjuvants, may disturb the structure even of conformationally restricted peptides profoundly [30]. Generation of sets of mAbs against a peptide antigen is a valuable tool to evaluate the quality of vaccine candidate components [30,32,34]. One important quality criterion is the proportion of parasite-binding mAbs within the population of peptide-reactive antibodies elicited. In the case of the SERA5derived peptide FB-23 all five mAbs analyzed bound to blood stage parasites in IFA with developmentally varying staining patterns expected for this antigen. While both the full-length SERA5 (P120) and its processed fragment P47 were recognized by four of the five mAbs, one mAb was generally negative in Western blot analysis. Further evidence for diversity of the fine specificity of the mAbs came from the analysis of their crossreactivity with the set of peptides evaluated for immunogenicity. Three of the mAbs reacted to a variable degree with the peptide comprising aa 17­73. This indicates that the sequence stretch aa 57­73, that overlaps with the FB23 sequence (aa 57­ 94) comprises at least part of their epitope. Conformational aspects may be responsible for lack of binding to the Cterminally truncated peptide comprising only aa 48­73. Attempts to improve the anti-parasite cross-reactivity of responses against the sequence stretch aa 48­73 by introduction of an intramolecular cyclization failed and also none of the anti-FB-23 mAbs bound to the cyclized variants. For the first time we could formally prove expression of SERA5 at the protein level in salivary gland sporozoites. In these the protein was completely processed and only P47 was detectable. No signal was found in IFA with sporozoites. This could be explained by a low amount of protein which is compensated in Western blot by enrichment of parasite proteins. Alternatively, SERA5 might not be accessible for antibodies on the surface of sporozoites. The function of SERA5 in sporozoites remains to be elucidated, but it is tempting to speculate that this protein is involved in invasion and/or egress not only in the blood stage, but also in other life stages of the parasite. Absence of inhibition in an in vitro growth inhibition assay despite parasite recognition in IFA shows that antibody binding to SERA5 alone is not enough to inhibit parasite growth. It has indeed been reported previously that antiSERA5 inhibitory effects involve monocytes [21,39] in a process called antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) [3]. It would therefore be interesting to test our mAbs in an ADCI test system. Moreover, the value of in vitro growth inhibition assays as correlates of protection remains to be determined [2,29]. While the N-terminus of SERA5 is highly polymorphic, the sequence stretch represented by FB-23 (aa 57­94) is highly conserved [14]. An alignment of 62 SERA5 sequences from African, Asian and South American P. falciparum isolates [12,27,31,38] revealed only four isolates with polymorphisms
