(Received 14 January/2 April 1998)

The solution structure of Desulfuromonas acetoxidans cytochrome c7 has been refined by using 1HNMR spectra recorded at 800 MHz and by using pseudocontact shifts in the final energy minimization procedure. The protein, composed of 68 amino acids, contains three paramagnetic heme moieties, each with one unpaired electron. The largely distributed paramagnetism broadens the lines in several protein parts. The structure is now relatively well resolved all over the backbone by the use of 1315 meaningful NOEs and 90 pseudocontact shifts. The statistical analysis of the structure indicates its satisfactory quality. The protein-fold is quite similar to that of the analogous four-heme cytochromes c3 for those parts which can be considered homologous. The solvent accessibility and the electrostatic potential surfaces surrounding the three hemes have been analyzed in terms of their reduction potentials. The resulting magnetic susceptibility anisotropy data obtained from pseudocontact shifts are analyzed in terms of structural data. Keywords : NMR; multiheme cytochrome; solution structure ; magnetic susceptibility tensor.

Solution structures obtained by NMR of paramagnetic metalloproteins are becoming numerous but they still represent a continuous challenge since the large line width of some signals requires a variety of unconventional approaches to try to increase the resolution [1]. Nuclear relaxation constraints have been used in some iron-sulfur proteins [2 4] and pseudocontact-shift constraints in cerium(III)-containing calmodulin [5] and low spin iron(III) proteins [6 11]. Desulfuromonas acetoxidans is a bacterium which produces energy via a cytochrome-linked electron-transfer process to either sulfur or fumarate, which act as electron acceptors [12]. This organism produces a cytochrome, cytochrome c7 (cyt c7, hereafter) which, in the oxidized form, contains three low-spin heme groups, each with one unpaired electron [13]. The heme iron ions are bound to histidine residues from analogy with cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio organisms, which have four hemes and which show large similarity with the present system [14 21]. The function of cyt c7 has not yet been elucidated; however, it has been reported that it could function as a terminal reductase [22] and more recently that it acts as a polysulfide reductase [23]. It could represent the terminal reductase in D. acetoxidans. However, its physiological electron donor still remains to be identified. The X-ray structure of cyt c7 is not available. From 600MHz 1H-NOESY, COSY, and TOCSY experiments a structure was obtained although only two ring protons of two of the six axial histidine rings could be assigned, being as broad as 500

1000 Hz [24]. No signal of the other four histidine rings was assigned nor has been assigned now. Furthermore, isotope labeling cannot be accomplished as, despite cyt c7 being also expressed in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans [25], the growth in minimal medium of both bacteria is very poor and very large volumes (of the ordered of several hundreds liters) are needed to prepare an NMR sample. The structure of the protein backbone is such that not many long-range NOEs could be expected and short-range NOE constraints are not best suited to solve this type of structure. Despite these difficulties a family of 20 conformers was obtained with the program DIANA [26] with small viola° tions and a backbone rmsd of 0.70 0.22 A with respect to the average structure [24]. The extensive use of the REDAC strategy [26] was responsible for such low rmsd values. A loop of the structure was still quite disordered because of the lack of longrange NOEs. We have now refined the structure by (a) acquiring spectra at 800 MHz ; (b) using a new program to obtain a family of structures called DYANA [27] ; and (c) introducing pseudocontact shifts to assess the quality of the structure. The 800-MHz spectrometer and possibly the improved hardware (DMX versus AMX) have allowed us to detect and assign more than 500 longrange NOEs, which are very many for a protein of 68 amino acids and with this fold. The DYANA algorithm [27] is a torsion-angle simulated-annealing approach which is much faster than the previous DIANA [26]. Finally, 90 pseudocontact shift values of backbone protons could be obtained from an extensive assignment of the reduced form (unpublished results from our laboratory). Pseudocontact shifts have been used as structural constraints both with DYANA [27] and with REM [28, 29] calculations. In the present case the pseudocontact shifts could not be efficiently used within the DYANA program because many protons sense more than one metal-centered magnetic tensor and the minimization with a simulated-annealing protocol is difficult when the minima are not well defined by a single set of parame-

ters. Still, three tensors could be obtained which are consistent with the NOE-derived structure. Actually, an energy minimization was possible using both NOEs and pseudocontact shifts as constraints. The final structure is satisfactory and better defines external loops which were previously ill defined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS NMR sample preparation. Cyt c7 from D. acetoxidans was obtained and purified as reported [24]. The 1H-NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein in 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, to give 2 3 mM solutions. NMR spectroscopy. The 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 800 spectrometer operating at 800.13 MHz. A time-proportional phase increment (TPPI) NOESY [30, 31] spectum was recorded at 298 K in D2O solution on a spectral width of 50 ppm with a recycle time of 275 ms and a mixing time of 100 ms. This spectrum was obtained by presaturating the residual water resonance during the relaxation delay and the mixing time. To optimize the observation of connectivities in the diamagnetic region, another TPPI NOESY map in H2O solution at 298 K was recorded on a smaller spectral width (22 ppm) with a recycle time of 658 ms, a mixing time of 100 ms and water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation (WATERGATE) [32]. Both two-dimensional spectra consisted of 2 K data points in the F2 dimension. 1024 experiments were recorded in the F1 dimension, using 80 and 256 scans for the spectrum with smaller and larger spectral width, respectively. Raw data were multiplied in both dimensions by a pure cosine-squared bell window function and Fourier-transformed to obtain 1024 1024 real data points. A polynomial base-line correction was applied in both directions. Data processing was performed using the standard Bruker software package. The two-dimensional maps were analyzed on IBM RISC 6000 computers with the aid of the program XEASY [33]. Proton-proton distance constraints. The volumes of the NOESY cross-peaks between assigned resonances were obtained by manual integration, with the elliptical integration routine implemented in the program XEASY. NOESY cross-peak intensities were converted into upper limits of interatomic distances by following the methodology of the program CALIBA [34]. Structure calculations. The experimental distance constraints were used to generate protein conformers using the DYANA program [27]. A residue containing the heme moiety was added to the standard library as a protein residue. At variance with previously reported works [6, 8, 24, 35], this residue does not include any axial ligand, but only contains the iron atom and the atoms belonging to the heme. With this modification the axial ligands reach their proper orientations with respect to the heme and in the protein frame only through the effect of experimental constraints, without any structural assumption. The heme moieties were linked to the amino acid sequence: each heme was linked to the tail of the protein by a chain composed of 30 pseudoresidues (LLM). These special linker residues, contained in the standard library, are formed by atoms with null Van der Waals radius and are free to penetrate the polypeptide chain. To link the iron atoms to their own axial ligands, some distance constraints were introduced : the N2 of histidines 17 and 30 were linked to the iron atom of heme I, those of histidines 20 and 53 were linked to that of heme III and those of histidines 45 and 66 to that of heme IV, by introducing an upper distance ° ° limit of 2.20 A and a lower distance contraint of 1.90 A. Upper

° ° (2.10 A) and lower (1.80 A) distance limits from the A-carbons of thioethers of the heme moieties to the S of cysteines were used in the calculations to link the heme moiety to the bound cysteines (the A-carbons of thioethers 2 and 4 of heme I are linked to the S of cysteines 26 and 29, respectively, those of heme III are linked to cysteines 49 and 52, those of heme IV are linked to cysteines 62 and 65). The use of the above upper limits between the heme and the cysteines is justified as the three hemes are of c-type. The distance limits between the N2 of the axial histidines and the iron ion were imposed by analogy with all the structures of heme proteins available in the Protein Data Bank [15 21]. The choice of the specific `distal' ligand for each heme is based on the sequence alignment of D. acetoxidans cyt c7 and Desulfovibrio cytochrome c3 [14] and was further checked through calculations performed without the introduction of any constraints between the iron ions and their axial ligands. When the upper distance limits involving the histidines' N2 and the iron ions were set equal to infinite the protein fold was the same, beside an increase in disorder of the imidazole rings. 1704 distance constraints derived from two-dimensional NOESY connectivities were used in DYANA calculations. 27 stereospecific assignments were obtained through the program GLOMSA [34]. 1000 random structures were annealed in 10000 steps using the above constraints. The 35 structures with the lowest target function were included in the family. Structure calculations and analyses were performed on an IBM SP04 parallel computer. Pseudocontact-shift constraints. Pseudocontact shifts arise from the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy and depend on the nuclear position with respect to the principal axes of the magnetic susceptibility tensor [36, 37]. Within the metal-centered point-dipole point-dipole approximation, the following equation holds: ipc
j

1 12r3 ij

jax (3n2 ij

1)

3  jrh (l2 ij 2

m2 ) ij

(1)

where jax and jrh are the axial and rhombic anisotropies of the magnetic susceptibility tensor induced by the j-th paramagnetic ion, lij, mij and nij are the direction cosines of the position vector of atom i with respect to the j-th magnetic susceptibility tensor coordinate system and r ij is the distance between the j-th paramagnetic center and the proton i. j is equal to 1, 2, 3 in the present case, as there are three paramagnetic centers. According to Eqn (1), peudocontact shifts contain structural information and can be used as structural constraints [7, 9, 38]. They are long-range constraints, as they decrease with the reciprocal of the third power of the metal-nucleus distance. In this work they were used during the energy-minimization procedure. The pseudocontact shift values were obtained by subtracting the chemical shifts measured for the totally reduced, diamagnetic form of the protein (unpublished results from this laboratory), from the corresponding shifts of the completely oxidized, paramagnetic form. The chemical shifts of the reduced protein agree with those reported in the literature, when available [39]. Only those protons for which stereospecific assignment is known in both oxidation states and for which no contact contribution to the hyperfine shift was expected were considered. The resonances of cysteines, histidines and heme moieties were therefore not included in the calculations. The 15 independent magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensor parameters (five parameters are needed to describe each tensor:  ax, rh, and three independent direction cosines that define the principal directions of the  tensor with respect to the

chosen axis system) could be evaluated by best fitting an extended set of equations like Eqn (1), with the position vectors for each proton obtained for each structure of the starting family, to the same set of experimental pseudocontact shift values. The calculation was performed with the program FANTASIAN [7, 9] which determines the above parameters fitting the experimental pseudocontact shifts simultaneously on all the structures of a family. The backbone atoms of the latter structures were first best superimposed. Restrained energy minimization (REM) calculations were performed introducing both NOE and pseudocontact shift constraints through of a modified Sander module of the program AMBER [28, 29], called PSEUDOREM [7]. The output was compared with the results of a REM calculation performed by applying the NOE constraints only The magnetic anisotropy parameters needed for these calculations were obtained by running the program FANTASIAN [7, 9] over the family of structures calculated with DYANA. The tolerance on the pseudocontact shifts was chosen to be large enough to include possible deviations from the metal-centered approximation and possible changes in the diamagnetic shift between the oxidized and reduced form of the protein (e.g. due to minor structural changes or to different hydrogen-bonding network of amide protons). In this work, tolerance values of 0.3 ppm and 0.5 ppm were imposed to non-exchangeable and exchangeable protons, respectively (the tolerance imposed to exchangeable protons is larger as their diamagnetic shift is more dependent on experimental conditions, such as pH, temperature, etc., than the shift of non-exchangeable protons). A preliminary set of magnetic anisotropy tensor parameters was obtained by running the program FANTASIAN over the family of structures determined by DYANA. These values were used as input for the minimization procedure. A final set of magnetic susceptibility tensor parameters was calculated over the family of minimized structures and used for obtaining information about the electronic structure of the paramagnetic centers.

Angular overlap calculations. We have used angular overlap (AO) calculations to reproduce the magnetic properties determined by using pseudocontact-shift constraints and to related them to structural parameters. A modified version of the program CAMMAG [40, 41] has been used for these purposes. Ligand-field parameters similar to those already reported for other low-spin heme-iron systems have ben used. They are as follows: e 8000 cm 1, ex 0 cm 1, ey 600 cm 1 for the heme moiety, and e 7800 cm 1, ex 0 cm 1, ey 520 cm 1 for the axial histidines. The spin-orbit coupling constant  was 340 cm 1 and the orbital reduction factor k was 0.8. Structure analysis. The quality of the final family of structures has been analyzed in terms of ideal geometry parameters with the Procheck-NMR program [42]. The solvent-accessible surface area analysis was carried out with the AREAIMOL utility of the CCP4 [43] suite of programs, using the Lee and Richards algorithm [44].

RESULTS Sequence-specific assignment. An extensive sequence-specific assignment of the protein resonances in the 1H-NMR spectrum of the fully oxidized form of cyt c7 from D. acetoxidans was available [24]. We have repeated the assignment of the protein residues under the same experimental conditions (see above) but recording the two-dimensional NOESY maps with a higher frequency spectrometer (800 MHz), in order to obtain more structural constraints and thus a better structure definition. A total of 323 proton resonances has now been assigned, which corresponds to 74% of the total expected proton signals (71% of the amino acid residues, 97% of the heme resonances). The assignment is in agreement with that already published [24, 45], with the exception of very few resonances. A total of 1704 NOESY cross-peaks has been observed and assigned, we thus obtained 562 more peaks than in the previous work.

Secondary structure. Fig. 1 shows the short-range and medium-range NOEs observed for the backbone and -protons. Two prolines are present in the sequence, which break the sequential connectivities involving NH, and six glycines which break the H-HN(i,i 1) connectivities. Short-range and medium-range connectivities of the type (i,i 3), (i,i 4), as well as (i,i 2) involving backbone and protons are observed for residues 16 25, indicating the presence of an helix in that region. The larger number of NOEs found in our 800-MHz two-dimensional maps with respect to those found in the less resolved 500 600-MHz spectra of our previous work [24], are helpful for a better definition of this helical structure [so, for example, HA-HN(i,i 2) connectivities for residues 17, 18, 19, 20 and HA-HN(i,i 4) connectivities for residues 17, 18, 19, 20 were missing in the lower frequency spectra]. Some further short segments of helical structures are found in the regions 27 30, 41 47, 59 66, as suggested by the presence of short-range and medium-range sequential connectivities in those regions. As far as the 27 30 and 63 66 segments are concerned, no corresponding NOEs were detected in the spectra of our previous work, due to the insufficient sensitivity of those experiments. In particular the 59 66 region, due to the larger number of connectivities available, assumes a different local conformation. The presence of an antiparallel -sheet involving residues 2 8 and 11 18 is clearly indicated by the presence of longrange (i.e. between residues in the 2 8 range and residues in the 11 18 range) backbone NOEs and is evident from Fig. 2. The turn between the two -strands, involving residues 8 11, is evident from the (i,i 2) connectivities of Fig. 1. Solution structure calculations. 1704 NOESY experimental constraints have been obtained, and their distribution is shown in Fig. 3 A. These NOE constraints were transformed into upper distance limits with the program CALIBA, which uses a volume-to-distance correlation. The best calibration of observed intensities was found to be inversely proportional to the fifth or sixth power of the proton-proton distances, depending on the calibration class of NOE constraints. 1315 out of the total 1704 experimental constraints were found to be meaningful and therefore used in the DYANA calculations. The average number of meaningful experimental NOE constraints per residue is 18.5 (considering each heme as a further protein residue). The resulting family was constituted by 35 structures; the total target function values for the above 35

° structures are in the 0.42 0.70 A2 range, which results in a ° mean value of 0.62 0.07 A2. The family has rmsd values with ° ° respect to the mean structure of 0.82 0.12 A and 1.16 0.09 A for backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively. The values found in this work are somehow larger than those reported earlier 1. The REM minimization procedure was applied to this family of 35 structures first without the introduction of pseudocontact shifts as structural constraints. The family of 35 energy-minimized structures (Fig. 4) has an rmsd with respect to the average ° structure of 0.78 0.12 A for backbone atoms, and of ° 1.14 0.10 A for all heavy atoms. The rmsd values per residue are reported in Fig. 3 B. The average total energy is 2531 kJ ° mol 1, the largest total distance penalty is 0.44 A2. The rmsd values between the average structures of the DYANA and REM ° ° families are 0.41 A and 0.56 A for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively. Energy minimization with pseudocontact shift constraints. 90 pseudocontact shift values were evaluated for protons which are uniformly distributed all over the protein. These values are in the range 0.01 3.7 ppm for the positive ones, and ( 0.1) ( 4.5) ppm for the negative ones. These experimentally determined pseudocontact shifts were used as input for the program FANTASIAN thus obtaining the magnetic susceptibility tensor parameters. The magnetic susceptibility anisotropies have been
1 We believe that this can be explained by some over-refinement of the previously reported structure, due to the extensive use of the REDundant Angle Constraints strategy (REDAC) [26], exploited by the DIANA procedure, but which is not used for the present DYANA program. The larger number of NOEs observed now and the better definition of the secondary-structure elements support the overall refinement of the present structure with respect to the previous one.

used as structural constraints for the DYANA [38] calculations. In the present case the program was not able to energy minimize the protein structure in the presence of the 15 new parameters, related to the three magnetic centers, as efficiently as it does with the NOEs only. From numerous test calculations it appears that, when a pseudocontact shift is due to the sum of two or three magnetic centers, the simulated annealing algorithm does not efficiently minimize over the 15 magnetic susceptibility parameters. This may be partially due to the relatively few pseudocontact shift constraints. On the contrary, a refinement procedure which does not destroy an already folded structure, as

the simulated annealing does, should be applied. This is the case of REM calculations. The REM procedure was repeated for all the structures calculated by DYANA by introducing, in addition to the NOE constraints, also the pseudocontact shift constraints. The family of 35 structures resulting from PSEUDOREM calculations has rmsd with respect to the average structure of ° ° 0.80 0.12 A for backbone atoms, and of 1.16 0.10 A for all heavy atoms.

° DOREM families are 0.31 A for the backbone atoms and ° 0.39 A for all the heavy atoms. The use of pseudocontact shifts in the structure calculations without increase in the overall penalty guarantees that the metal ion positions are correctly located in the protein frame and that the iron-iron distances are well defined, since the pseudocontact shifts are long-range constraints (they depend on 1/r3 Fe) centered on each metal ion. H Furthermore, it is important to note that the deviation between

the experimental and calculated pseudocontact shifts is sizably reduced in the PSEUDOREM structures with respect to the DYANA structures. This indicates that the use of pseudocontact shifts as constraints is able to modify the structure at such an extent to sizably improve the agreement with these experimental data, even if it does not result in an improvement of the rmsd values. Therefore the PSEUDOREM family constitutes a better description of the solution structure of cyt c7.

A statistical analysis of structures for the REM and PSEUDOREM families is reported in Table 1. The values indicate a satisfactory quality of the obtained structures. Comparison with the previous structure. The present structure has been obtained with 1704 NOEs, of which 1315 were meaningful. 90 pseudocontact shifts are completely consistent with the calculated structure. The number of the NOEs is significantly larger than in the previous structure ; 562 new NOEs have been newly assigned. This is due to the use of a larger magnetic field (800 MHz versus 600 MHz) and a more advanced spectrometer hardware. The previously published structure was obtained with the distance-geometry program DIANA which contains a module REDAC (REDundant Angle Constraints) which allows users to add dihedral angle constraints to already folded structures when the dihedral angles are constant within the family. An extensive use of REDAC can lead to a somewhat overrefined structure 2. Furthermore the elements of structure and the overall shape of the protein are such that precious long range NOEs are few and only with more advanced technology can be detected. The two structures, whose parameters are deposited in the ° Protein Data Bank, differ with an rmsd of 4.2 A for the backbone and for the heavy atoms. This difference is essentially due to a translation of a loop which was previously lacking of NOE constraints. Residues in the 54 63 loop have rmsd values be° tween the two structures in the range 5 13 A. This has led to a readjustement of the Fe-Fe distances, with changes as much as ° 2 A. This difference may be relevant for understanding intramolecular electron transfer. The consistency of the 90 pseudocontact shifts, which are long-range constraints, with the calculated structure provides an assessment of the quality of the structure and gives confidence in it. Magnetic-susceptibility tensors. The final tensors, determined over the 35 structures of the PSEUDOREM family, have ax and rh values of 3.71 0.20 10 32 m3 and 1.27 0.20 10 32 m3, respectively, for heme I, 2.54 0.30 x10 32 m3 and 1.89 0.35 10 32 m3 for heme III, 3.54 0.50 10 32 m3 and 0.95 0.40 10 32 m3 for heme IV. The xx axis deviates about 2° from the pyrrole A-nitrogen in heme I, 57° in heme III and 57° in heme IV. The deviation of the zz axis from the perpendicular to the heme plane is about 6°, 21°, 5° for heme I, heme III and heme IV, respectively. The directions of the rhombic axes agree with those reported by Turner [45, 46], where the rhombic perturbation was evaluated by analyzing the 13C shifts of the heme substituents in terms of  molecular orbitals with perturbed D4h symmetry, assuming that they arise purely from Fermi-contact interactions and that the z axis of the magnetic susceptibility tensor is perpendicular to the heme plane [11]. The values of  ax here determined for the three hemes of cyt c7 compare well with those available in the literature for cytochrome b5 [11, 47, 48], in which low-spin iron(III) has the same axial ligands. The parameters describing the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy (directions and  values) are related to the orientation of the imidazole plane of the iron-coordinate histidines. Since for two out of three hemes no experimental information on the imidazole plane orientation is available, it may be important to

check whether the average, over the family, of each imidazole plane orientation is consistent with the experimental magnetic anisotropy data. To check this, Angular Overlap calculations have been performed using the CAMMAG program [40, 41]. It is found, as expected on symmetry-based considerations, that the bisector of the acute angle between the two histidine planes moves clockwise from a Fe-N pyrrole direction as much as the x direction of the  tensor rotates anticlockwise from the same direction. The average orientations of each histidine plane in the family provide a direction of the rhombic axis of the  tensor for each heme equal, within 10°, to that found from the fitting of the experimental pseudocontact shifts. Furthermore, when the angle between the planes of the two imidazoles of each heme is 90°, the rhombic anisotropy is zero, while it is maximal when this angle is zero. This had been noted already when discussing the EPR spectra of bis-histidine heme systems [49]. The rhombic anisotropies found for the three heme groups in cyt c7 is in the order III IV I, which is the reverse order, as expected, of angles between the imidazole planes for the three hemes. The results of these calculations suggest that the orientations of the His planes in our structure are completely consistent with the magnetic properties, experimentally determined from the pseudocontact shifts. The determination of the histidine plane orientations from the magnetic susceptibility data represents a further precious source of structural information as it could be translated into dihedral angle constraints to be used in the structure calculations for better defining the iron ligands' conformation. Structure analysis. The structure analysis was performed with the Procheck-NMR program [42] on the energy-minimized average structure resulting from the REM family. The quality of the structure was checked through the Ramachandran plot. Among the 58 residues which are meaningful for the Ramachandran plot (i.e. non-glycine, non-proline and non-terminal residues), 60.3 % fall in the most favored regions, 31.0% in the additional allowed regions, 3.4 % in generously allowed regions, and 5.2% in disallowed regions. The latter are residues Cys26, Asp40 and Cys62. With respect to the previous structure [24] the overall fold is confirmed. However, the loop 55 63 has a significantly different orientation with respect to the previously published structure and it is now better defined thanks to the increase in longrange NOEs, whereas in the previous structure was disordered and free to move due to the absence of NOEs, as it was reported [24]. As a consequence of its reorientation there is a small rearrangement of the rest of the protein. In particular, the distance between the iron ions of heme I and IV is somewhat decreased ° ° (about 2 A out of 20 A) thus making the present structure more similar to that of cytochromes c3, where the average distance is ° 17.7 A. In Fig. 5 the elements of secondary structure provided by the Procheck-NMR [42] program for the present solution structure of cyt c7 are shown. A comparison with those of 4-heme and 8-heme cytochromes c3 from Desulfovibrio, as they result from the analysis of the crystal structures, is also reported. High-reso° lution (1.7 2.2 A) X-ray structures are available for the tetraheme cytochromes from D. desulfuricans (ATCC 27774 [16] and Norway strain [21]), Desulfovibrio gigas [20], Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough [15] and Miyazaki [17]), and for an octaheme cytochrome from D. desulfuricans [19]. The latter protein is a dimeric protein, each subunit containing four hemes. As already reported on the basis of the primary structure [14], cyt c3 from D. desulfuricans appears to be the closest to cyt c7.

The view is related to that in Fig. 4., i.e. with heme IV in the top part of the molecule, and heme I in the bottom part. The figure was produced using the program MOLMOL [50].

of cyt c7 The results are summarized in Table 2. It appears that heme IV, which has the highest reduction potential, is the least exposed to water. Fig. 6 shows the electrostatic potential surface for cyt c7. The orientation of the molecule is the same as in Fig. 4, where heme IV is at the top of the molecule and heme I at the bottom. It can be observed that in both proteins heme IV is surrounded by a large positive surface (due to Lys residues). The electrostatic field and the low accessibility to solvent molecules are presumably the major factors which differentiate the redox potential of the various hemes within the protein. Conclusions. A satisfactory structure has been obtained for a difficult protein, the difficulty owing to the presence of three paramagnetic centers over 68 amino acids and to the presence of a few external loops, together with an unfavorable shape. A relatively large number of NOEs per residue has provided a well-resolved structure all over the backbone for which any risk of overrefinement was intentionally avoided. From the experimental pseudocontact shifts and the obtained structure, three magnetic anisotropy susceptibility tensors have been determined. Restrained energy-minimization calculations were performed by using NOEs and pseudocontact shifts as constraints, which showed that both experimental structural constraints are consistent with the present structure. As already discussed, due to the presence of a larger number of long-range NOEs, the overall conformation is now better defined than in the previously reported structure. In particular, the fold, the secondary-structure elements and the relative orientation and distance of the heme moieties are very close to those observed in all cytochromes c3. The availability of the structure and of the assignment of the NMR signals allowed us to identify which heme is reduced first in the electron-transfer process [24]. The heme with the highest reduction potential is the heme bound to histidines 66 and 45 which is named heme IV. This finding can be rationalized in terms of exposure of the hemes to the solvent and of electrostatic potential in their surrounding. Heme IV seems to be the less exposed to solvent and surrounded by a more extensive positive surface than the other hemes. These can qualitatively rationalize the different reduction potentials of the hemes. Ultimately, this can give hints for the understanding of the electron-transfer process.

A common feature of all the above cytochromes is the presence of a -sheet in the N-terminus. In cyt c7 this -sheet is composed by the 3 6 and 13 16 -strands. In cyt c3 from D. desulfuricans (ATCC 27774) it is composed by the -strands 9 12 and 17 20. A similar motif is observed in cyt c3 from D. gigas and D. vulgaris Hildenborough and Miyazaki, whereas in the other proteins the two strands are separated by more residues. A second -sheet is present in D. vulgaris Miyazaki and in one of the two molecules present in the crystal cell of D. vulgaris Hildenborough. Cyt c7 contains an A-helix spanning from residue 18 to residue 24, i.e. involving the two distal ligands of heme I and III. An analogous helix is present in all the structures of cytochromes c3. It should be noted that in all these proteins the distal ligands of hemes I and III are always three residues apart. In cytochromes c3 a further helix is observed involving three or four residues preceding the amino acid before the distal ligand of heme II. It is noteworthy that this helix has different lenghts in the two molecules of the crystal cell of cyt c3 from D. vulgaris Hildenborough. No corresponding helix is present in cyt c7, where the second heme is lacking. After a long segment of random coil all the structures of these multiheme cytochromes show an helix (a 310 helix in the present structure of cyt c7). This helix concludes with the distal ligand of heme IV (with the only exception of D. vulgaris Miyazaki). In tetra-heme and octa-heme cytochromes, one or two helices are observed for the residues around the proximal histidine of heme III. From the secondary-structure analysis of cyt c7 the residues 52 57 (the proximal ligand of heme III being His53) are classified as a bend, although the connectivities are typical of an A-helix. Maybe such connectivities are not enough to give rise to a canonical A-helix. The solvent accessibility has been analyzed with the AREAIMOL program [43] for the energy-minimized solution structure
