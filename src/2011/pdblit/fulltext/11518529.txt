Cystathionine b-lyase (CBL) is a member of the g-family of PLP-dependent enzymes, that cleaves Cb-S bonds of a broad variety of substrates. The crystal structure of CBL from E. coli has been solved using MIR phases in combination with density modification. The structure has been refined to an R-factor of 15.2% at 1.83 Å resolution using synchroton radiation diffraction data. The asymmetric unit of the crystal cell (space group C2221 ) contains two monomers related by 2-fold symmetry. A homotetramer with 222 symmetry is built up by crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. Each monomer of CBL can be described in terms of three spatially and functionally different domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 60) consists of three a-helices and one b-strand. It contributes to tetramer formation and is part of the active site of the adjacent subunit. The second domain (residues 61 to 256) harbors PLP and has an a/b-structure with a seven-stranded b-sheet as the central part. The remaining C-terminal domain (residues 257 to 395), connected by a long a-helix to the PLP-binding domain, consists of four helices packed on the solvent-accessible side of an antiparallel four-stranded b-sheet. The fold of the C-terminal and the PLP-binding domain and the location of the active site are similar to aminotransferases. Most of the residues in the active site are strongly conserved among the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway. Additionally, CBL is homologous to the malY gene product indicating an evolutionary relationship between a and g-family of PLP-dependent enzymes. The structure of the b,b,b-trifluoroalanine inactivated CBL has been refined at 2.3 Å resolution to an R-factor of 16.2%. It suggests that Lys210, the PLP-binding residue, mediates the proton transfer between Ca and Sg.

In this pyridoxal-5'-phosphate(PLP)-dependent belimination, the substrate cystathionine undergoes transaldimination with the enzyme-bound cofactor PLP, followed by a-proton abstraction to yield an a-carbanion equivalent stabilized as a pyridoxalketimine p-quinonoid. Subsequent elimination of homocysteine generates the PLP derivative of aminoacrylate. The latter picks up a proton and reverse transaldimination forms iminopropionate and regenerates the enzyme-bound PLP. Hydrolysis of iminopropionate to pyruvate and ammonia presumably occurs outside the active site of CBL. E. coli CBL is encoded by the metC gene, and the native enzyme forms a homotetramer (Belfaiza et al., 1986). Each monomer consists of 395 amino acids (Mr 43,032) and contains one molecule of PLP as cofactor covalently linked to the e-amino group of Lys210 by an aldimine bond (Martel et al., 1987). CBL has been shown to share extensive homology with cystathionine g-synthase (CGS), which catalyzes the formation of cystathionine from Osuccinylhomoserine and cysteine. A common evolutionary origin of the two enzymes has been suggested (Belfaiza et al., 1986; Parsot et al., 1987). Because of our continuing interest in enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the essential amino acids lysine (Mirwaldt et al., 1995), threonine and methionine (Kreft et al., 1994; Laber et al., 1994a,b), we investigated the three-dimensional structure of CBL. PLP-dependent enzymes are used in all living organisms to synthesize, degrade and interconvert amino acids. They catalyze a wider variety of different chemical reactions than enzymes utilizing any other cofactor. This versatility arises mainly from the ability of PLP to labilize all four bonds of the a-carbon (Dunathan, 1966; Dunathan & Voet, 1974). A comprehensive comparison of the amino acid sequences of PLP-dependent enzymes has shown that most of them can be assigned to one of three different families of homologous proteins, termed a, b and g-family (Alexander et al., 1994). While the structures of some PLP-dependent enzymes of the a-family have been determined (John, 1995), structural information of any member of the g-family is still missing. In the present paper we report the spatial structure of the first member of the g-family, namely E. coli CBL, and suggest a reaction mechanism for CBL based on structural features of the native and the F3 Ala inactivated enzyme form. The CBL-F3 Ala complex is the first high resolution structure showing this kind of suicide inactivation.

Results and Discussion
Quality of the final model The final model of CBL is made up of two monomers with 391 amino acids each. The model was kept close to standard geometry throughout refinement. The final crystallographic R-factor is ° ° 15.2% for data from 8.0 A to 1.83 A resolution. The mean positional error of the atoms as estimated ° from a Luzatti plot (Luzatti, 1952) is 0.19 A. For well-defined parts of the structure, especially the b-strands, the internal side-chains and the region around the cofactor, the error is likely to be lower. The quality of the final model is summarized in Table 1. The main-chain dihedral angles are all well defined, and the values of nearly all non-glycine residues are within energetically allowed regions (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968). The two outliers, Ser339 and Ile159, are active-site residues and have well-defined electron density. The 2Fo­Fc maps contoured at 1.2s show continuous density for all main-chain atoms with the exception of the four N-terminal residues. A number of side-chains on the surface of the molecule show only weak or no electron density at all and have high thermal ° parameters (B > 60 A2 ). During the late stage of refinement, a bicarbonate ion could be identified in

the active site. Its B-factors are 1.5 times higher than the average B-factor of the surrounding, suggesting an occupancy below one. Overall structure CBL is known to exist as an a4-tetramer in solution (Belfaiza et al., 1986) and this quaternary structure is observed in the crystal structure. Two monomers are in close contact around a crystallographic 2-fold axis coinciding with the y-axis to form a dimer. Two such dimers are related by a non-crystallographic diad axis. The dimensions of ° ° ° the tetramer are about 70 A × 75 A × 91 A and those ° ° ° of the monomer are 40 A × 35 A × 70 A , respectively. In the following, the structure is described beginning with the monomer, then the dimer, and finally the tetramer. The secondary structural elements were assigned on the basis of characteristic hydrogen-bonding patterns (program DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983)) and phi, psi backbone torsion angles. Accordingly, the enzyme consists of 40.2% helical structure,

24.8% bends, 14.7% b-sheet and 20.3% unclassified coil structure. The secondary structural elements are listed in Figure 1, together with the nomenclature used in this paper. Additionally, the classification of all reverse turns is listed in Table 2.

Figure 2. Stereo ribbon presentation of the CBL monomer, emphasizing secondary structure elements. a-helices are drawn as green spirals, b-strands as magenta arrows. PLP and PLP-binding Lys210 are shown in a ball-and-stick representation. All drawings of the structure were made with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and RASTER3D (Merrit & Murphy, 1994).

The monomer folds up into three spatially and functionally distinct regions: (1) an extended N-terminal arm (residues 1 to 60) that includes three helices and one b-strand which participates in a two-stranded antiparallel b-sheet with its symmetry mate of a crystallographically related subunit, (2) a large PLP-binding domain (residues 61 to 256) and (3) a smaller C-terminal domain (residues 257 to 395). The PLP-binding domain and the C-terminal domain are connected by a long a-helix consisting of 33 amino acids (residues 246 to 278) with a kink near residue Gly256. A stereo ribbon presentation of the CBL monomer fold is shown in Figure 2. The central part of the large domain is a mainly parallel seven-stranded b-sheet (a, g, f, e, d, b, c). The strands, which form a curved plane around helix 5, have directions (+, -, +, +, +, +, +) with all cross-overs being right-handed. The b-sheet structure is sandwiched between eight a-helices (4 to 11). Helices 4, 8, 9 and 10 are located on one side of the b-sheet and shield it from solvent, helices 5, 6, 7 and 11 lie on the opposite side, at the interdomain interface. The short helices 7, 8 and 10 exhibit a hydrogen bonding pattern typical for 310 helices. PLP is covalently attached to Lys210 (Martel et al., 1987) and binds near the N terminus of helix 5 and the C termini of strands d, e and f. A four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (A, B, D, C) is the central part of the small domain. The topology of the b-sheet in Richardson notation (Richardson, 1981) is +1, 2x, -1, with the cross-over being right-handed. The four helices of the small domain (13, 14, 15 and 16) are situated on the solvent accessible side of the sheet.

Two monomers associate tightly to form a dimer as shown in Figure 3. The interaction surface ° between these monomers is large: 2520 A2 of solvent-accessible surface area per monomer are buried upon dimer formation which corresponds to 15.7% of the total surface area. The 2-fold dimer symmetry axis passes between the N termini of the long, kinked helices 12, the centres of PLP-binding helices 5 and the C termini of helices 7. The active sites are close to each other, the PLP phosphate ° atoms are separated by 22.1 A, and each is formed from residues contributed by both monomers of the dimer. Intimate contacts between the two monomers in the dimer are established by several hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and, most remarkably, by various intermolecular active-site interactions. PLP interacts strongly with Arg58* of the N-terminal part of the adjacent subunit. The guanidinium group of Arg58* forms three strong hydrogen bonds and a short salt-bridge with the ° PLP phosphate group (2.9 A) and, additionally, a ° short hydrogen bond to Tyr111 (2.8 A). A similar monomer to monomer interaction is made by Tyr56*, which, like Arg58*, is one of the hydrogen donors in the hydrogen-bonding network around the PLP phosphate. Dimer formation is also stabilized by an extended loop in the N-terminal arm, of which Ser32, Ser33, Phe36, Val39 and Lys42 form six hydrogen bonds to residues in the small domain (Asp329, Met336, Tyr 338 and Ser339) of the second subunit. These loops also allow hydrophobic interactions. The side-chains of Phe36, Val39 and Phe55 are bound to a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the

206 neighboring subunit, lined with the side-chains of Leu328, Met336, Tyr338 and Leu348. In the center of the dimer, near the active sites, helices 5, 6, 7 and 11 are in close contact with each other and with their symmetry mates. Hydrophobic residues are mostly found in the contact region of these helices, forming a large hydrophobic patch comprising residues Leu95, Ile98, Phe117, Ile121, Leu125 and Met240 from both subunits. This patch is surrounded by several hydrogen bonds established between Cys85(SH)-Gly241*(O), Gln100(OE1)-Gln100*(NE2), Gln242(OE1)-Gln242*(NE2) and Gln100(NE2)-Lys124*(O). Interactions between the PLP-binding helix 5 (see below) and Lys124* complete the dimer interface. (a)

X-ray Structure of Cystathionine b-lyase

The C terminus of helix 5 is oriented against the e-amino group of Lys124*, which is at hydrogenbonding distance to three carbonyl oxygens of the helix 5 C terminus. Thus, the macrodipole of helix 5 compensates for two charges: the positive helix-dipole end interacts with the phosphate group of the cofactor, while the negative helixdipole end interacts with the e-amino group of Lys124*, thereby allowing a ``helix-mediated'' salt-bridge between the PLP phosphate and the amino group of Lys124*. The tetramer (Figure 4) is formed by symmetric association of two dimers, resulting in an overall 222 symmetry. The CBL tetramer interface is larger than the interfaces of other PLP-dependent enzyme

° structures: 2014 A2 of surface area per monomer are buried upon tetramer formation from dimers. Approximately 23 residues from each subunit are involved in the formation of the tetramer interface. The interface is largely formed by residues from the N-terminal half of the long a-helix 12 and by residues between helix 2 and helix 3 of the Nterminal domain. 16 residues per monomer are involved in this tetramer interface patch. As shown in Figure 5 five of these residues participate in a remarkable, well-ordered cluster of charged residues, where Arg30, Asp217, Asp247, Tyr250 and Arg254 strongly interact with their symmetry mates, leading to a cluster of eight arginines, eight aspartates and four tyrosines. Arg30, Asp247 and their symmetry mates form two disks in the center of the tetramer. Stacking interaction between these disks and the shielding effect of Tyr250 optimize their charge­charge interactions. Furthermore, two more patches exist which stabilize tetramer formation: (1) between the N-terminal helix 1 and the C-terminal helix 16 of a non-crystallographically related subunit (four hydrogen bonds and a water-mediated salt bridge formed by Lys5 and Asp382) and more important (2) between helix 2 and its associated C-terminal loop with their symmetry mates (several van der Waals' contacts, three hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge between Lys17 and Asp37). b-strand N is also part of this extended loop and forms an antiparallel two-stranded b-sheet with its symmetry mate.

Active-site structure In Figure 6 the (2Fo­Fc ) electron density map of ° the region around the cofactor is shown at 1.83 A resolution. The active-site interatomic distances are illustrated schematically in Figure 7(a) together with the atom nomenclature used in this paper. The detailed spatial structure of the CBL active site is shown in Figure 7(b). In the orientation of Figure 7(b) the active site is delimited as follows: at the bottom by the C termini and C-terminal loops of strands e and f; at the top by the loop connecting strand b and helix 6 (Tyr111); on the right by the C terminus and C-terminal loop of strand d and by residue Arg372, which is located in b-strand D of the small domain; on the left by the N-terminal loop of strand g, by the extended loop comprising residues 55* to 59* of the second subunit in the dimer and by the C-terminal part of helix 11, which is also provided by the second subunit; in front by the C-terminal loop of strand a and the N terminus of helix 5 which is the phosphate-binding helix; and in the back by the extended chain connecting helix 14 and strand C. In the following the active-site structure will be described, beginning with the groups directly contacting the cofactor, and proceeding counterclockwise around the PLP pyridine ring. This is followed by a comparison of the active-site structures of CBL and AAT which provides features, possibly relevant to the reaction mechanism. The pyridine nitrogen atom (N1) of PLP forms a ° strong hydrogen bond/salt bridge (2.74 A) with the

208 carboxylate OD2 from Asp185. The OD2 of Asp185 forms a further strong hydrogen bond with a well-ordered water molecule which is held in place by a strong interaction with Glu154. The OD1 of Asp185 forms two hydrogen bonds: a strong one with the hydroxyl group of Thr187 and a weak one with the amide nitrogen of Asn186. These hydrogen bonds fix the Asp185 carboxylate group in a geometrically optimal position for interacting with the N1 of the pyridine ring. The methyl group at C2 of the cofactor is not involved in any specific interactions with the protein.

X-ray Structure of Cystathionine b-lyase

The presumably ionized hydroxyl group at C3 receives only one weak hydrogen bond from a well-ordered water molecule in the active site of CBL. At position 4, the original PLP aldehyde function has reacted with the e-amino group of Lys210 to form the internal aldimine. The aldimine is protonated, based on the strong absorbance of the crystals near 425 nm (T.C. unpublished results). The positive charge on the nitrogen atom NZ should be largely compensated by its interaction with O3'. The phosphate ester at position 5 participates in a total of seven hydrogen bonds. Gly86 and Ala87

lie at the N terminus of helix 5 and make hydrogen bonds via their amide nitrogen atoms to OP1 and OP2, respectively. Thr209 also makes a hydrogen bond to OP1. All other interactions with the phosphate group originate from residues of the second subunit. Arg58* is the hydrogen donor for three hydrogen bonds, and Tyr56* is the hydrogen donor for a hydrogen bond to OP3. Thus Arg58* should compensate directly for the negative charge(s) of the phosphate group. Furthermore, Arg58* also interacts with the hydroxyl group of Tyr111. Presumably, the helix macrodipole (Hol, 1985) of helix 5 partially participates in charge compensation. The OP4-C5'-C5-C4 torsion angle assumes an energetically favorable angle of 75.0° placing the ester oxygen atom on the A-face (Ford et al., 1980) of the cofactor. The PLP pyridine ring is sandwiched between Tyr111 on top (B-face) and Ala207 and Thr187 at the bottom (A-face). The phenol ring of Tyr111 is located at an angle of about 5° with respect to the pyridine ring, between the cofactor and the bulk solvent. On the opposite face of the cofactor,

side-chains of Ala207 and Thr187 are in van der Waals' contact with all ring atoms of the pyridine ring, minimizing movement of the cofactor in that direction. The bicarbonate found in the active site makes two hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium group of Arg372. The main-chain nitrogen of Ser339, the NE1 of Trp340 indole ring and a water molecule are also at hydrogen-bonding distance to the oxygens OB1 and OB2 of the bicarbonate. The phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr111 forms the only hydrogen bond to OB3 of the bicarbonate. By these interactions it is tightly fixed in a position where the a-carboxylate of the substrate should be bound. The affinity of CBL to bicarbonate was not measured but must be substantial. Bicarbonate was not included during purification and crystallization. The three-dimensional structure of chicken mitochondrial AAT was the first PLP-dependent enzyme (not counting glycogen phosphorylase which utilizes PLP non-canonically), which has been determined by X-ray crystallography (Ford et al., 1980). Although there is no significant

210 sequence homology, the monomers of CBL and AAT (McPhalen et al., 1992) show strong structural similarity. The active-site structure of CBL was overlaid with corresponding residues of AAT using a least-square superposition of the PLP rings, the active-site lysines and the essential aspartate residues at the N1 position of the pyridine ring. Figure 7(c) shows the superposition of the two structures. In accordance with the fact that CBL and AAT utilize the same cofactor and catalyze different chemical reactions, their active-site structures show obvious similarities and substantial differences. The most remarkable similarity in the active-site structures is the spatial similarity between AATTrp140 and CBL-Tyr111. As in AAT, the pyridine ring of the cofactor leads to stacking interaction with the phenolic ring of Tyr111, which is nearly parallel to the plane of the pyridine ring. Ring-stacking interaction increases the electrophilic character of the conjugated PLP system, and is known to be essential to the mechanism of AAT (Hayashi et al., 1990). The function of the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr111 will be discussed later. Another important feature in the active site of AAT is also conserved in CBL: the positions of the (a)

X-ray Structure of Cystathionine b-lyase

pyridine N1 atom and the neighboring aspartate carboxylate group align nearly perfectly. Electrostatic interaction stabilizes the positive charge at N1 and increases the ``electron-sink''-character of the PLP system. The positions of the substrate a-carboxylate-binding arginines (AAT-Arg386, CBL-Arg372) are also analogous. Obviously, the guanidinium group of Arg372 is closer to O3' than the Arg386-guanidinium group of AAT in the open conformation (Malashkevich et al., 1993). The two tyrosines AAT-Tyr70* and CBL-Tyr56*, which are both contributed by the second subunit, also align well. In AAT this residue is mainly involved in the binding of the cofactor (Toney & Kirsch, 1987) as is CBL-Tyr56* and in the interaction with Lys258 during the catalytic cycle by positioning the lysine e-amino group in a proper orientation to abstract a proton from Ca (Kirsch et al., 1984). The most striking difference in the active-site structure is the environment around O3'. In AAT Tyr225 and Asn294 are in close contact to O3', stabilizing its negative charge and reducing the basicity of the aldimine nitrogen (Yano et al., 1993). Additionally, Tyr225 is thought to be involved in ketimine hydrolysis by binding an incoming water molecule (John, 1995). In CBL Trp340 is found in a

similar position but shows only weak interactions with O3' as deduced from the distance. The hydrogen-bonding distance of Trp340-NE1 to the bicarbonate OB2 is shorter than the distance to O3', counting for a direct involvement of Trp340 in substrate binding. This structure dissimilarity seems reasonable because hydrolysis of a ketimine intermediate does not occur in the reaction mechanism of CBL and substrate activation may function via Tyr111. The special location of the guanidinium group of Arg58*, which is obviously different to the corresponding group in AAT (Arg266), allows binding of the PLP phosphate and interaction with Tyr111, thereby increasing the nucleophilic character of Tyr111. Another remarkable difference is the hydrogenbonding network around Asp185 (Asp222 in AAT). No histidine residue is located near Asp185. Instead, the carboxylate group of Asp185 forms strong hydrogen bonds to OG1 of Thr187 and to a well-defined water molecule, which is also bound by Glu154. These interactions prevent any rotation of the Asp185 carboxylate group and allow charge dissipitation over the hydrogen network around Asp185. This charge delocalization is known to be

important in the mechanism of AAT (Yano et al., 1991, 1992). In AAT Ala224 is in van der Waals' contact to all pyridine atoms, minimizing movement in direction toward the A-face. In CBL two residues fulfil this function: the side-chains of Ala207 and Thr187. Sequence comparison Extensive sequence information on enzymes of transsulfuration via cystathionine is now available. Five different enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway were found to give a high similarity score. They differ in the catalyzed chemical reaction types (Cg-S lyase, Cg-S synthase and Cb-S lyase) and in their substrate preference. The sequences vary in length from 364 to 465 amino acids. The protein sequence alignments (GCG Sequence Analysis Software package 7.0, Devreyx, 1984) of CBL from Escherichia coli (Belfaiza et al., 1986) with CGL from rat (Erickson et al., 1990), CGS from Escherichia coli (Duchange et al., 1983), CBL from Arabidopsis thaliana (Ravanel et al., 1995), CBL from Bordetella avium (Gentry-Weeks et al., 1993) and CBL from Salmonella typhimurium (Park & Staufer, 1989) show

213 in most aminotransferases (Mehta et al., 1993). Therefore, MalY was classified as a member of the a-family of PLP enzymes (Alexander et al., 1994). To align CBL and MalY, we adjusted the alignment according to the secondary structure elements found in CBL as shown in Figure 9. A comparison of the active-site residues, prolines, glycines and residues forming the hydrophobic cores shows homology between CBL and MalY. Because MalY is a mosaic of conserved residues of aminotransferases and enzymes utilizing cystathionine as indicated in Figure 9, we suggest that MalY is an evolutionary link between the a and g-family. Interestingly, the active-site aspartates of CBL and aminotransferases align to different aspartates in MalY as shown in Figure 9, despite the fact that this residue is thought to be strongly conserved among the different families of PLP-dependent enzymes. Comparison with other PLP-dependent enzyme structures CBL is a tetramer, built up as a dimer of dimers (Figure 3 and 4). The fold of CBL is related to those of AAT (Ford et al., 1980; McPhalen et al., 1992), DGD (Toney et al., 1993), tyrosine phenol-lyase (Antson et al., 1993), v-amino acid aminotransferase (Watanable et al., 1989) and ornithine decarboxylase (Momany et al., 1995). The common seven-stranded b-sheet, the active-site lysine and aspartate were used for overlap maximization with the program O ° (lsq improve with a 3.5 A overlap cutoff) (Jones & Kjelgaard, 1991). An overlay of the Ca-traces of CBL and AAT is shown in Figure 10(a), an overlay with DGD which exhibits the highest structural similarity to CBL is shown in Figure 10(b). AAT is an a2-dimer with its shape and dimensions very similar to that of the CBL dimer. The resulting superposition has 191 homologous Ca ° atoms, aligned with a r.m.s. deviation of 2.05 A. All b-strands of the seven-stranded b-sheet of the PLP domain align nearly perfectly. Also, the helices have topologically equivalent partners, but they differ in length and orientation. In contrast to the large domains, the small domains do not fit each other because they are differently oriented relative to the large domains. In the orientation of Figure 10(a) the small domain of CBL is counterclockwise twisted against the large domain with respect to AAT. A similar phenomenon has been described in a superposition of DGD and AAT (Toney et al., 1995). An alignment of the small domains demonstrated that three helices (the C-terminal end of helix 12, helix 14 and helix 16) have structural equivalents in AAT. The remaining differences in the superposition of the small domains are due to enlarged loops between strands A/B and strands C/D in CBL, folded in additional helices and a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet. As also noted for AAT and, despite low sequence identity, the folds of the tetrameric DGD and TPL are very similar to that of CBL. Using a cutoff of ° 3.5 A a superposition with TPL aligned 198 Ca with

identities of 30.8%, 31.8%, 27.1%, 38.6%, 86.3% and similarities of 56.8%, 53.7%, 53.1%, 60.6%, 92.9%, respectively. Figure 8 illustrates the alignment and displays the structural elements of E. coli CBL. The alignment indicates that 43 amino acids are strictly conserved, that the homology in the N-terminal part is extremely low and that the other parts, especially the PLP-binding domain, exhibit high homology. Of the 24 residues bordering the active site and the cofactor, 11 residues are invariant, corresponding to 25% of the total conserved amino acids. These include residues involved in cofactor binding (Tyr56, Arg58, Gly86 and Thr209), residues important for catalysis (Tyr111, Glu154, Asp185, Asn186 and Lys210) and Arg372, which is the general a-carboxylate binding group. At some active-site positions mutations exist that should not affect the original function, for example, the exchange of Thr by Ser at position 187. The exchange of Ile159 to Pro is also a tolerable modification. Ile159 is one of the residues forming the hydrophobic pocket around the C2 methyl group of the PLP and, as has been stated above, is one of two outliers in the Ramachandran plot. It is involved in a short bend comprising four residues preceding helix 9, and has a f-angle appropriate for Pro. The remaining active-site replacements must be due to different chemical reaction types and to different substrates of the aligned enzymes. Remarkably, Tyr111 is conserved in all sequences, although it is supposed to fulfil different functions dependent on the catalyzed chemical reaction type. Tyr111 is believed to be an acid­base catalyst in CGL and CGS acting on the Cg of the substrate. Inactivation studies of CGL by propargylglycine (Washtien & Abeles, 1977) confirm this idea. In CBL the hydroxyl group is supposed to protonate the PLP-bound aminoacrylate generated by Cb-S cleavage. In E. coli CBL three hydrophobic cores exist which are conserved in the aligned sequences. Two of them are part of the large PLP-binding domain and are located on both sides of the seven-stranded b-sheet and the third is part of the small C-terminal domain, at the b-sheet side opposite to the large domain. Summarizing, the conservation of the active-site residues, the hydrophobic cores and the glycine and proline positions clearly document the pronounced structural homology between the enzymes involved in transsulfuration despite low overall sequence identity. Recently it has been reported that MalY of the E. coli maltose system is a PLP-containing enzyme with enzymatic activity of a Cb-S lyase (Zdych et al., 1995). MalY has been described as a monomeric protein of 43,500 Da and does not show sequence homology to CBL of E. coli, but contrary to CBL exhibits weak homology to aminotransferase sequences using conventional amino acid sequence alignment programs (Reidl & Boos, 1991). In MalY 7 of 11 amino acids are found which are invariant

214 ° a r.m.s. deviation of 2.29 A, a superposition with ° DGD 209 Ca with a deviation of 1.91 A. In contrast to AAT, the relative orientation of the large and the small domain in DGD, TPL and CBL are almost the same. While the three common helices of the small domain are nearly completely conserved, as is the four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (Figure 10(b)), structural differences are mainly caused by enlarged loops of the four-stranded b-sheet, especially by the loop between strands A/B. The comparison clearly indicates that the folds of CBL, AAT, TPL and DGD exhibit similar folding pattern and domain organization. The areas of greatest similarity are the core of the large PLP-binding domain, whereas main differences are found in the small domain, in the relative orientation of the large and the small domain and

most strikingly in the folding and location of the N-terminal region. In CBL the N-terminal segment is located at the top of the monomer (in the orientation of Figure 10), whereas the N-terminal regions of the other structures are located more in the center. In this position the CBL N-terminal segment forms part of the active site of the crystallographically related subunit at the phosphate group of the cofactor. It is also central in the quaternary assembly. The N-terminal part in CBL accounts for 24.9% of the tetramer interface. Another important segment for intersubunit interaction is the region between strands b and d which has been shown to be essential in the tetramer formation of DGD (Toney et al., 1995). With respect to the N-terminal arm, this region is located on the opposite side of the CBL dimer. As seen in

Figure 10(b) there are no structural homologous parts in CBL and thus, not surprisingly, the tetramer interfaces of DGD and CBL are built from opposite sides of the constituent dimers. The functional reason for tetramer formation is still not understood. The superpositions of CBL with AAT, TPL and DGD strengthen the suggestion that PLP enzymes of the a and g-family with various functions evolved from a common ancestral protein. Inhibition by b, b, b-trifluoroalanine Several PLP-dependent enzymes that catalyze b and g-elimination reactions, namely CBL (E. coli ), CGL (rat liver), tryptophanase (E. coli ), tryptophane synthase (E. coli ), threonine deaminase (E. coli ) and threonine dehydratase (E. coli ) undergo time-dependent inactivation by F3 Ala (Silverman & Abeles, 1976). An important feature of this ``suicide''

inactivation (Abeles & Walsh, 1973; Walsh et al., 1972), is the unmasking of a latent reactive functionality of a substrate analog. The mechanism shown in Figure 11 is proposed for inactivation (Silverman & Abeles, 1977). In a first step, a Schiff base is formed between the inactivator and the enzyme-bound pyridoxal. Subsequently HF is eliminated from F3 Ala, which results in a b-haloa, b-unsaturated imine, an activated Michael acceptor. This adduct can react with a nucleophile at the active site via Michael addition, which leads to covalent labeling and inactivation of the enzyme. The experiment reported here was carried out to substantiate that the e-amino group of the active-site Lys210, which forms a Schiff base with the cofactor, is the same residue which binds to the inactivator via Michael addition. The crystals of the CBL­F3 Ala complex were prepared by cocrystallization, with space group and cell parameters identical to the native CBL crystals. To calculate an initial (Fo­Fc ) electron

density map, the coordinates of the CBL structure were used, from which the bicarbonate and the active-site waters had been removed. Clear, continuous density between the cofactor and the Lys210 was observed in this map, indicating a covalent lysine­inactivator­PLP product, as proposed by Silverman & Abeles (1977) and Fearon et al. (1982). Part of the omit map, in which the inhibitor was omitted from the final refined structure, is shown in Figure 12(a) and revealed well-defined electron density for the bound inhibitor. This map unambiguously identifies intermediate F in Figure 11. A model of intermediate F was built into the density and refined to convergence. The final model gave a crystallo° graphic R-factor of 16.2% for all data between 8 A ° and 2.3 A resolution. The model which includes 488 water molecules showed the same stereochemistry

as the native structure (PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993)). An example of the (2Fo­Fc ) electron density map, calculated after the refinement was completed, is shown in Figure 12(a). For CGL, a closely related enzyme to CBL, it has been reported that two moles of F3 Ala become covalently bonded per tetramer (Silverman & Abeles, 1977). In the crystal structure of the inactivated CBL, however, the inhibitor was present in each subunit. Therefore, it was attempted to refine alternately occupancies and B-values of the atoms which originate from F3 Ala. After three cycles, occupancies and B-factors had converged to their final values: the B-factors of ° these atoms decreased from a mean value of 38.6 A2 ° 2 and the occupancies from a mean value to 33.7 A of 1.0 to 0.64, indicating a similar situation as in CGL.

218 Figure 12(b) is a stereo view of the active site including the inactivation adduct superimposed with the uncomplexed active enzyme. The orientation is identical with the active site presentation in Figure 7(b). The corresponding interatomic distances are listed in Table 3. The structural differences of the native and the inactivated enzyme form may be characterized as follows. The phosphate group of the cofactor remains almost fixed during inactivation, but the pyridine ring reorientates by rotation around the bonds between the phosphorus atom and the pyridine ring, mainly by rotation around C5-C5' of 20° (the OP4-C5'-C5-C4 torsion angle assumes an angle of 95°) as suggested by Ivanov & Karpeisky (1971). The cofactor ring has an increased tilt angle of 30° (relative to the pyridine ring plane in the native structure), which allows the Na and Ca of F3 Ala to lie in the plane of the pyridine ring system and to form a coplanar external aldimine bond to C4'. The phenolic ring of Tyr111 follows the movement of the cofactor and rearranges itself parallel to the pyridine ring by rotation around Cb-Cg. In the inactivation product the position of N1 of the cofactor is nearly unaltered. N1 is still forming a strong salt bridge to OD2 of Asp185. The position of the a-carboxylate group of F3 Ala is only slightly different from the bicarbonate in the native structure. Hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions exist with the guanidinium group of Arg372, optimized by coplanar arrangement. The shortened distance of Trp340-NE1 to the a-carboxylate group is in accord with its proposed role in substrate binding. The carbonyl oxygen of the inactivated PLP derivative is in hydrogen bonding distance to the hydroxyl groups of Ser339 and Tyr56*. Most interestingly, the structure of the inactivation product proves that Lys210 is in fact the active-site nucleophile reacting via Michael addition with the inactivator. It must also be the residue which transfers a proton from Ca to Sg in the reaction with substrates.

Catalytic mechanism Based on these structures, we propose a reaction mechanism for CBL. Figure 13(a) depicts residues involved in substrate binding and Figure 13(b) those involved in catalysis. We are aware of a possible over-simplification because CBL may in analogy to AAT (Jansonius & Vincent, 1987) undergo conformational changes from an open to a closed conformation during catalysis. Indeed, substrate analogs alter the crystallization properties of CBL, and crystals of the native enzyme crack after soaking with the substrate cystathionine in a few hours. This suggests that the molecular structure described here may correspond to an ``open'' form, in which the substrate enters the active site cavity from a position above Arg58* and Arg59* (Figure 7(b)) to form the Michaelis complex. We suggest that Arg372 and Arg59* anchor the a and the distal carboxylate group of the cystathionine substrate, respectively, whereas the a-amino group is held by the ionized PLP hydroxyl group. Additionally, Ser339 may donate a hydrogen bond to the sulfur atom and thus break the pseudosymmetry of the cystathionine. Evidence stems from the inactivated CBL structure, where the hydroxyl group of Ser339 is in hydrogen bonding distance to the Cb-carbonyl of the reaction end product. In concert, these interactions properly position the substrate in a productive binding mode. Arg372 is one of three residues conserved in nearly all PLP-dependent enzymes and is supposed to act as general a-carboxylate docking site. The location of the bicarbonate in the native structure (Figure 7(b)) and the position of the carboxyl group of the inactivator (Figure 12(b)) are in line with this suggestion. The bicarbonate is a competitive inhibitor of CBL. Steady state kinetics, measured under anaerobic conditions, indicate that the KM of the substrate cystathionine is reduced fivefold, whereas Vmax is unchanged (data not shown). Further investigations are under way. Arg59* of the second subunit forms an ion pair with Glu235*, as does Arg292 with Asp15 in AAT. The Arg292­Asp15 ion pair leads to catalytically favorable rigidity around Arg292 (Cronin & Kirsch, 1988) which binds the distal carboxylate group of substrates and inhibitors (Kirsch et al., 1984; Sandmeier & Christen, 1982). The same should be true for CBL. Binding of the distal carboxylate group by Arg59* releases Glu235* to bind the distal amino group of the substrate. Similarly with AAT the charge interaction with Arg59* might trigger conformational changes essential for efficient catalysis (Kirsch et al., 1984). The formation of the external aldimine is still unclear. The imine group of the internal aldimine has a pKa > 11, as determined by titration experiments (T.C., unpublished results), and thus is unfavorable for a transaldimination. In AAT Tyr225 and Asn194 withdraw electrons from O3' and decrease the pKa of the internal aldimine bond by

1.7 units (Yano et al., 1993). These residues do not have obvious counterparts in CBL. Transaldimination requires proton abstraction from the a-amino group of the substrate. We suppose that Tyr111, a residue conserved in all cystathionine utilizing enzymes, is the most probable candidate for this function. The hydroxyl group of Tyr111 is in hydrogen-bonding distance to Arg58* and also close to the protonated aldimine nitrogen. This special position should lower the pKa of Tyr-OH. The pH optimum of CBL is between 8 and 9 (Dwivedi et al., 1982). We suggest that Tyr-OH exists in this range as phenolate. Substrate binding might trigger conformational changes which increase the hydrophobicity of the active site and weaken the Tyr111(phenolate)/Arg58*(guanidino) interaction, thereby increasing the pKa of Tyr-OH. Several aromatic residues which are close to the cofactor

(Tyr338, Phe55* and Tyr238*) may be involved in active-site shielding. The second part of the reaction mechanism is better understood and illustrated in Figure 13(c). After formation of the external aldimine, the a-carboxylate and the sulfur atom of the substrate are optimally oriented for a proton transfer from Ca to the e-nitrogen atom of Lys210. The electronic arrangement of the cofactor, especially the positive charges on the aldimine nitrogen and N1, is ideal for the delocalization of the negative charge of the resulting carbanion over the whole conjugated p-system. The structure of the inactivated CBL indicates that Lys210, the PLP binding residue, is responsible for the proton transfer between Ca and Sg of the substrate. In the transaldimination step, Lys210 has been released uncharged on the A-side of the coenzyme. It can form H-bonds to Ser339-OH,

220 Tyr56*-OH, and to Sg of the substrate. Interactions with Ser339 and Tyr56* allow the e-amino group to approach either Ca, Cb or Sg. In the first part of the Cb-S bond cleavage Lys210 abstracts the Ca proton, which produces the quinonoid intermediate. This intermediate is optimally stabilized by stacking interactions with Tyr111, electrostatic interactions between the charged groups of the substrate and the apoprotein and a short-distanced H-bond between Asp185 and N1. After Ca deprotonation Lys210 has a positive charge on its e-amino group, which is attracted by the negative charged phosphate group of the coenzyme, thereby coming within hydrogen bonding distance to the Sg guided by Ser339 and Tyr56*. In this position it is optimally oriented to induce Cb-S bond cleavage by protonating Sg, producing homocysteine. Elimination of homocysteine generates the PLP derivative of aminoacrylate, which is converted to iminopropionate by addition of a proton. This proton may originate from the first transaldimination step and be transferred to aminoacrylate via Tyr111. After release of homocysteine and loss of charge compensation at Arg59*, CBL should again adopt a conformation in which the transaldimination equilibrium between external and internal aldimine will be shifted towards the latter one, as indicated in Figure 13(c). Presumably the reaction end product iminopropionate is hydrolyzed to pyruvate and ammonia outside the protein. Fast kinetic experiments are indicating that Cb-S bond cleavage or the second transaldimination step are rate limiting (data not shown). The results reported herein form the basis for future investigations on the structure function relationships of CBL and other related members of the g-family of PLP-dependent enzymes, including the analysis of inhibitor complexes, site-directed mutagenesis and fast kinetic experiments.

Solvent accessibility Solvent accessibility areas were calculated using the algorithm of Lee & Richards (1971) with a probe radius ° of 1.4 A. Enzyme purification and crystallization CBL from E. coli was purified as described previously (Laber et al., 1996). Briefly, the enzyme was purified in a three-step procedure: first by anion exchange chromatography using a DEAE column (Pharmacia) with a linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 M (NH4 )2 SO4 , followed by a hydrophobic interaction step on a Phenyl Sepharose column (Pharmacia) using a linear gradient from 1.0 to 0 M (NH4 )2 SO4 , and finally by affinity chromatography using Blue A matrix (Amicon) with a gradient from 1.0 to 0 M (NH4 )2 SO4 . The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE. Prior to crystallization the enzyme was extensively dialyzed against 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM PLP and concentrated to about 5 mg/ml. The enzyme was crystallized by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method. Crystals were grown at room temperature by mixing 3 ml of protein solution and 1.5 ml precipitant solution containing 10 to 14% PEG400, 100 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.3) and 150 mM CaCl2 . Hanging droplets were equilibrated against 1 ml of precipitating solution. Crystals appeared after a few days and grew to a maximum size of 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm × 0.3 mm. The crystals obtained were orthorhombic and belong to the ° space group C2221 , with cell constants a = 60.91 A, ° ° b = 154.75 A, c = 152.70 A, a = b = g = 90°. The crystals ° diffract to at least 1.9 A and contain one dimer in the asymmetric unit. Derivative and b, b, b-trifluoroalanine crystals It was not possible to prepare heavy atom derivatives in the conventional way by soaking crystals in appropiate buffered solutions. Platinum and mercury compounds caused cracking of crystals within seconds, even relatively unreactive compounds at very low concentrations ( < 10 mM). The remaining heavy atom compounds did not appear to bind. We therefore cocrystallized with a stochiometric amount of heavy atoms and obtained three excellent heavy atom derivatives. The quality of the mercury containing derivatives was further improved by backsoaking, i.e. equilibration of the derivative crystals for several hours in a heavy atom free stabilization solution. Heavy atom compounds and optimal stochiometric ratios and

backsoaking times that led to the heavy atom derivatives suitable for MIR phasing are given in Table 4. Soaking of CBL crystals with F3 Ala, an inactivator of CBL, also resulted in crystal cracking. To obtain crystals of the inactivated enzyme, CBL was cocrystallized with F3 Ala under same conditions described in the previous section and the stoichiometry indicated in Table 4.

Determination of the local symmetry and averaging of MIR density The native Patterson map showed pseudo-origin peaks in the xz-plane indicating the presence of local symmetry axes parallel to x and z. Consistently, a self-rotation function (Hoppe, 1957; Rossmann & Blow, 1962) ° ° calculated in the resolution range 10 A to 4 A using the program GLRF (Tong & Rossmann, 1990) showed only 2-fold axes along a, b and c. An inspection of heavy atom binding sites and their symmetry equivalents indicated the position and orientation of the local dyads. To confirm and refine the parameters of the local 2-fold axes, the program IMP of the CCP4 programming package was used. After refinement of the local x and z axes, the correlation coefficients between the MIR densities of the local noncrystallographic related monomers were 0.65 and 0.64, respectively. It was now possible to calculate an averaged density map from the original MIR density. An envelope containing exactly the CBL tetramer was used to average density within this envelope with the ``Uppsala'' program AVE. The averaged density showed major improvements compared to the original density and allowed us to recognize all secondary structure elements and the whole backbone fold, except five residues at the N terminus. Model building and structure refinement Model building was performed on an ESV-30 Graphic system workstation (Evans & Sutherland, Salt Lake City, UT) using the program O (Jones & Kjelgaard, 1991; Jones et al., 1991). In the beginning of the first building session it became obvious that the fold of CBL is similar to other PLP-dependent enzymes and thus the coordinates of TPL ° were used as a guide in model building. The 2.5 A averaged MIR map allowed us to fit a polyalanine model of the whole backbone fold, except five N-terminal residues, into the electron density. Subsequently, the polyalanine model was converted to the appropriate sequence and refined by energy restrained crystallographic refinement with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) using ¨ the parameters developed by Engh & Huber (1991). Use was made only of the conventional restrained leastsqares refinement procedure on positional parameters and B-factors. Refinement proceeded in several cycles interrupted for manual rebuilding on the basis of 2Fo­Fc difference Fourier maps. The summary of the restrained least-sqares refinement is listed in Table 1. In the early stages of refinement, an overall B-factor of ° 20 A2 was used. In later steps, individual B-factors were ° refined but restrained to a standard deviation of 2.0 A2 for

Data collection and processing ° A complete native data set to 1.83 A resolution has been obtained as reported previously (Laber et al., 1996). Diffraction data from the heavy atom derivatives were collected using an imaging plate scanner (MAR-research). Graphite monochromatized CuKa radiation from a RU200 rotating anode generator (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 5.4 kW was used. The apparent focal spot size was set to 0.4 mm × 0.4 mm. Data sets were obtained by rotating the crystal about c* parallel to the spindle axis for 90° with a rotation range of 1° per image. Reflection data were processed using the MOSFLM package (Leslie, 1990) and subsequently, the structure factors were scaled, reduced and truncated to intensities using programs from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). Each data set was collected from one crystal. Data collection statistics for the native and derivative data sets are summarized in Table 5.

Multiple isomorphous replacement Three-dimensional difference Patterson functions were calculated to determine the heavy atom positions. The interpretation of potential heavy atom derivatives was done with PROTEIN (Steigemann, 1974) using self and cross-vector verification. One platinum and two mercury positions were easily found. These sites were refined against centric reflections only. The refined heavy atom parameters and the statistics of the MIR are shown in Table 4. Final phase calculations, solvent flattening, density ° modification and phase extension to 2.5 A were done with programs of the CCP4 package. A set of skeletons was calculated from the CBL solvent flattened map (Jones & Thirup, 1986). These skeletons were used to define molecular boundaries, and to build the tetramer envelope, which was an essential tool for the following model building procedures.

the B-factors of bonded atoms. After several cycles of ° refinement the resolution was extended from 2.5 A to ° 1.83 A. When the R-value was 28% solvent molecules were introduced in stereochemically reasonable positions with high difference electron densities. As a check on the PLP geometry, all restraints were removed and the model subjected to extensive rounds of positional refinement. The changes in the mean values of bond length and angles were similar in magnitude to the ° mean positional errors of the atoms (0.19 A). Therefore, the weak constraints on the cofactor geometry were maintained over the whole rounds of refinement. During the whole refinement the R-value between Fo and Fc obtained by Fourier backtransformation decreased from 40% to 15.2% and the free R-factor, calculated by setting aside 10% of the reflection data, from 41% to 22.1%. No non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed on the dimer.
