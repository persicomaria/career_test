Abstract

The three-dimensional structure of the complex between methyl a-D-mannopyranoside and concanavalin A has been refined at 2.0 A resolution. Diffraction data were recorded from a single crystal (space group P21212~, a = 123.7, b = 128.6, c = 67.2 A) using synchrotron radiation at a wavelength of 1.488 A. The final model has good geometry and an R factor of 19.9% for 58871 reflections (82% complete), within the resolution limits of 8 to 2 A, with F > 1.0tr(F). The asymmetric unit contains four protein subunits arranged as a dimer of dimers with approximate 222 point symmetry. Each monomer binds one saccharide molecule. Each sugar is bound to the protein by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. Although the four subunits are not crystallographically equivalent, the protein-saccharide interactions are nearly identical in each of the four binding sites. The differences that do occur between the four sites are in the structure of the water network which surrounds each saccharide; these networks are involved in crystal packing. The structure of the complex is compared with a refined saccharide-free concanavalin A structure. The saccharide-free structure is composed of crystallographically identical subunits, again assembled as a

dimer of dimers, but with exact 222 symmetry. In the saccharide complex the tetramer association is different in that the monomers tend to separate resulting in fewer intersubunit interactions. The average temperature factor of the mannoside complex is considerably higher than that of the saccharide-free protein. The binding site in the saccharide-free structure is occupied by three ordered water molecules and the side chain of Asp71 from a neighbouring molecule in the crystal. These occupy positions similar to those of the four saccharide hydroxyls which are hydrogen bonded to the site. Superposition of the saccharide-binding site from each structure shows that the major changes on binding involve expulsion of these ordered solvents and the reorientation of the side chain of Tyrl00. Overall the surface accessibility of the saccharide decreases from 370 to 100 A 2 when it binds to the protein. This work builds upon the earlier studies of Derewenda et al. [Derewenda, Yariv, Helliwell, Kalb (Gilboa), Dodson, Papiz, Wan & Campbell (1989). EMBO J. 8, 2198-2193] at 2.9 A resolution, which was the first detailed study of lectin-saccharide interactions.

1. Introduction

Concanavalin A was first isolated and crystallized over 70 years ago (Summer, 1919). In solution the minimal molecular weight of concanavalin A is that of a dimer (Kalb & Lustig, 1968). Each of its identiActa Crvstallographica Section D ISSN 0907-4449 ~ 1994

CONCANAVALIN A-METHYL a-D-MANNOPYRANOSIDE calcium ion which is involved in stabilization of the cis peptide between Ala207 and Asp208. We now report the first full description of the methyl a-D-mannopyranoside-concanavalin A tetramer complex and extend the earlier study of the saccharide-binding site from 2.9 to 2.0 ,~, resolution. We also provide a comparison with the saccaridefree protein also at high resolution (Emmerich et al., 1994; Weisgerber & Helliwell, 1993).

cal subunits has one saccharide-binding site [Yariv, Kalb (Gilboa) & Levitzki, 1968] and two distinct metal-binding sites: one for a transition-metal ion and another for a calcium ion (Kalb & Levitzki, 1968). When the naturally occurring metals are removed from concanavalin A in acid, the protein no longer binds saccharides. Addition of the missing metals at the correct pH restores saccharide binding (Yariv et al., 1968). After the protein was crystallized in a form suitable for X-ray crystallography (Greer, Kaufman & Kalb, 1970), its structure was determined by two independent groups (Edelman et al., 1972; Hardman & Ainsworth, 1972). Initial expectations that a structure of the complex of concanavalin A and a saccharide would soon follow were not realized. Co-crystallization of concanavalin A and mannoside was reported by Hardman & Ainsworth (1976) but the crystals suffered from lattice disorders, which limited the resolution to 6 A. The saccharide-binding site was located, however. This was consistent with observations from NMR experiments (Brewer, Brown & Koenig, 1973; Brewer, Sternlicht, Marcus & Grollman, 1973; Alter & Magnuson, 1974; Villafranca & Viola, 1974) and conclusions from crystal studies of saccharide-soaked concanavalin A crystals which had been cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (Becker, Reeke, Cunningham & Edelman, 1976). Crystallographic studies of the saccharide complex of favin (highly homologous to concanavalin A) revealed a similar binding site but were unable to position the saccharide unambiguously (Reeke & Becker, 1986). Crystallization of well diffracting cubic crystals (space group 1213) of the complex of concanavalin A with methyl a-D-glucopyranoside was reported by Yariv, Kalb (Gilboa), Papiz, Helliwell, Andrews & Habash, 1987). This crystal structure has been solved at 2.0A resolution (Harrop et al., 1993) and will be reported in detail separately. The crystal structure of the methyl a-D-mannopyranoside concanavalin A complex was solved at 2.9/~ by Derewenda et al. (1989) and the details of the binding site were reported. That study showed that the methyl a-D-mannopyranoside molecule is bound in the C1 chair conformation, 8.7 A from the calcium-binding site and 12.8 A from the transition metal-binding site. There is a network of seven hydrogen bonds connecting O atoms 03, 04, 05 and 06 of the mannoside to residues Asnl4, Leu99, Tyrl00, Asp208 and Arg228. 02 and O1 of the mannoside extend into solvent. These results are confirmed here. We also describe the van der Waals interactions which characterize the proteinsaccharide interaction and we have been able to resolve the methyl substituent on the saccharide. Moreover, we have located a water ligand to the

2. Experimental and computational procedures
2.1. Crystall&ation, data collection and processing

Crystals were grown from stock solutions of 80150 mg protein ml-~by dialysis equilibration with a solution comprising 0.05 M Pipes, 0.1 M NaNO3, l m M MnCl2, l m M CaCI2, 2 m g m l - ~ NaN3 and 0.1 M methyl a-o-mannopyranoside (Pfanstiehl), pH 6.8. These conditions are as previously described (Derewenda et al., 1989). These crystallization conditions are as identical as possible to those for the saccharide-free (I222) crystals. The only differences are in the presence of the mannoside and, necessarily, the higher concentration of the protein. In the 1222 case 24 mg ml 1 is used typically while for the complex, which is very soluble, the much higher concentration was used. The pH and salt concentration are about equal for both crystal forms and both are grown by dialysis. A crystal of size 2.5 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm was used to collect all the X-ray crystallographic data on CEA Reflex photographic film at the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source at Station PX7.2 Daresbury, England (Helliwell et al., 1982). The storage ring was operated at 2 GeV. The circulating current was 190 mA at the start of data collection, and had fallen to 158 mA at the end of data collection, some 16 h later. The crystal capillary was aligned on the goniometer head with a parallel to the rotation axis and b initially parallel to the incident X-ray beam. The data were collected using a wavelength of 1.488/k and a collimator of 0.3 mm diameter with the crystal-to-film distance set at 58 mm. The crystal was at room temperature (=298 K) during data collection. An Arndt-Wonacott oscillation camera, modified for rapid oscillations at the synchrotron, was used. The oscillation interval was 0.9' from 0 to 60 ~and then increased to 1.Y from 60 to 90' of rotation of the crystal taking advantage of the short c axis, in order to collect a complete data set from one crystal in one run. The crystal was translated along the rotation axis several times during data collection to reduce the effects of radiation damage. An exposure time of 40 s per degree was used at the start and by the end of data collection this had increased to 55 s per degree in response to beam decay.

The orientation of the crystal was determined using one pair of stills measured at 0 and 90 °. Stills were also recorded after each translation to monitor for crystal slippage. All films were scanned at Manchester University using a SCANDIG 3 microdensitometer with a 50 ~m raster. The software for processing oscillation photographs (Arndt & Wonacott, 1977) was as follows. The pattern was generated using O S C G E N and the intensity measured using the profile-fitting option of M O S F L M and interfilm scaling was carried out using A B S C A L E . The data were scaled, merged and structure amplitudes calculated, using R O T A V A T A / A G R O V A T A (CCP4, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, 1979). A total of 237069 measurements were recorded which yielded 62198 unique reflections. Table 1 gives some statistics for the data set. The cell dimensions were determined as a = 123.74, b = 128.62, c--67.17,~. The space group was P212121. The Matthews number (Matthews, 1968) for the crystal is 2.73A3Da -~ (corresponding to 55% solvent). Initially we had hoped to merge the data from this crystal with those collected for the earlier 2.9 A study from a crystal of essentially identical cell parameters, which had been grown under identical conditions. However, data for the two crystals were not isomorphous (mean isomorphous difference on F, approximately 40%). Retrospective comparison of the two models revealed that the positions of the centres of mass differed by 0.7 A. Brief details of the data collected for the saccharide-free crystal structures are given in §3.6. 2.2. Model refinement Refinement was carried out using the X - P L O R program (Version 2.1) (Briinger, 1990) on a Silicon Graphics 4D power series workstation. The dictionary and parameter files were adjusted to accommodate the non-proline cis peptide and methyl a-D-mannopyranoside in each monomer. No restraints were placed on metal-ligand distances and no charge was given to the metal ions. Electrondensity maps were calculated within the CCP4 package (SERC Daresbury Laboratory, 1979). Manual

adjustment of the model relative to the 2Fo - Fc and F o - F c electron-density maps was carried out using F R O D O (Jones, 1981) adapted to run on an ESV30 (P. R. Evans, personal communication). Geometric analyses of the model were carried out with X - P L O R and D S S P (Kabsch & Sander, 1984). The model for the tetramer from Derewenda et al. (1989), PDB coordinate file 4CNA, was treated as a molecular-replacement solution for the present study. The starting R factor was 45%. This model contained only the protein atoms and was refined as a rigid body against the 2.0 A data. This was carried out for the tetramer as a whole and then each subunit treated independently. After rigid-body refinement the R factor was 37%. Restrained refinement of individual atomic positions was then carried out using a simulated-annealing protocol based on a temperature change of 3000-300 K using F > 1.0o-(F) data in the resolution range 8-2.4A (35644 reflections). The model was subsequently

regularized by energy minimization ( P O W E L L option in X -P LO R ) . Non-crystallographic restraints of 5 0 2 k J m o l - l A - 2 ( 1 2 0 k c a l m o l ~/k-2) were employed. The data set was then expanded to include data [with F > 1.00.(F)] in the resolution range 8-2 A (58871 reflections). The R factor was 30%. The model was again subjected to simulated annealing (4000 to 300 K) and regularized using the PO W E L L energy-minimization option. Individual temperature factors were refined and the R factor dropped to 26%. Examination of 2Fo - F,. and Fo - Fc electrondensity maps calculated using the protein model indicated that several changes in the conformation of individual amino acids were required. Clear (> 30.) F,, - F,. electron density for the sugars in the binding sites of the A, B and D subunits was observed. These three sugar molecules were, therefore, included in the refinement, although the methyl substituent for each was given zero occupancy at this stage. This was done in order to provide clear evidence for the position of the methyl substituent which had previously been thought to be disordered (Derewenda et al., 1989). The C subunit was notably less well ordered than the other three subunits and no clear density for a saccharide could be identified for this subunit at this stage. This anomalous behaviour of the C subunit continued throughout the refinement. We can offer no explanation for the anomaly. A total of 218 water molecules were identified and included in the model. Waters were included if they were in >30. F o - Fc density and made plausible hydrogen bonds; they were deleted if they did not reappear in the 2 F o - F c maps. The model was subjected to simulated annealing (700 to 300K), PO W E L L energy minimization and restrained temperature-factor refinement. Non-crystallographic restraints were loosened to a value of about 125.5 kJ m o l - I A - 2 (30 kcal m o l - I ,~-2). The R factor was 21.1%. A molecule of methyl a-Dmannopyranoside could now be modelled in the C subunit ( > 2.50. Fo - Fc electron density). The methyl substituents of the three other sugars could be seen in strong (>3.50-) F o - F ~ electron density. Two amino-acid sequence changes were also made to the model to correspond to the sequence determined by (Min, Dunn & Jones, 1992). A further 254 water molecules were added. A further cycle of simulated annealing (500 to 300 K), PO W E L L energy minimization and temperature-factor refinement was carried out, without any non-crystallographic restraints, resulting in an R factor of 20.2%. The remainder of the refinement alternated between minor manual changes in the model, such as addition/deletion of water molecules or geometry idealization followed by 20 cycles of PO W E L L energy minimization, until no further waters could be added or improvements made to the model. The final R factor was 19.9% on

3.1. Quality o f the final model

The tetramer, the four saccharides and the metal ions are shown in Fig. 1. Parameters relating to the final model are given in Table 2. The final model contains 533 solvent molecules and one chloride ion. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank.* The principal regions of poor density are the N-terminal residue and the surface loops at residues 120, 150, 160 and 202. Fig. 2 shows a Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) for each subunit. The three outlying residues are in poorly defined regions of the structure. In subunit A two residues Thrl20 (q~ = 58, ~ = 128 °) and Hisl21 (~ = 55, ~ = - 7 °) are significantly outside the allowed regions. In the B subunit only Ser204 (~, = 58, ~ = - 5 9 ~) is significantly outside the allowed region. A Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) indicates a mean coordinate error of between 0.2 and 0.4A (data not shown). All the atoms of the sugars are in well defined electron density and the presence of two water molecules ligated to each calcium ion has been established, in contrast to the earlier study at 2.9 A where only one water was found (Derewenda et al., 1989). Certain features of the structure were verified by P O W E L L minimization of a model structure lacking these features and examination of the resulting omit maps; for example the cis peptide between Ala207 and Asp208 was confirmed in this way. 3.2. Overall structural description The basic topology of the concanavalin A monomer is unchanged from the saccharide-free structures (Hardman & Ainsworth, 1972; Reeke, Becker & Edelman, 1975; Naismith et al., 1993) in the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). Almost 50% of the residues in the structure are in two large fl-sheets. The tetramer contains two dimers (Reeke et al., 1975), each distinguished by a 12-stranded antiparallel /3-sheet on one face. The dimers are formed by subunit A with subunit B and subunit C with subunit D. The A B dimer interaction comprises 17 hydrogen bonds, (six of which form the extended fl-sheet), seven singly bridging water molecules and * Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Reference: 5CNA, R5CNASF).

A similar pattern is observed for the A, B and D subunits with two differences. In the A and B subunits the region at Asp71 has a significantly higher temperature factor than in the D subunit. The carboxy terminus is, however, better ordered in the A and B subunits compared to the D subunit. This reflects differences in packing at these sites. As expected, the temperature factors are greatest for the loops connecting /3-strands. The loops around residues 120, 150, 160,

Fig. 3. Backbone temperature factor plots for each subunit of the tetramer. The peaks at residues 120, 150, a n d 160 occur at poorly modelled loops on the surface of the protein. The C subunit is anomalous in its behaviour; this is discussed in the text. The A subunit is top left, B subunit top right, C subunit bottom left and D subunit bottom right. Finally a similar plot is given for the saccharide-free structure.

JAMES H. NAISMITH et al. saccharide-binding loops (residues 12-14, 98-100, 207-208 and 227-228) for each of the subunits are 21, 22, 53 and 29A 2, respectively. The direct saccharide-protein interactions are very similar for all four subunits. These interactions fall into two categories: hydrogen bonds which are listed in Table 4 and van der Waals contacts which are listed for the B subunit in Table 5. In addition, the sugar of subunit A (and B) is linked to Thr226 OG1 of subunit B (A) by a singly bridging water molecule

853

(WF in Table 4). Fig. 5 gives the numbering scheme for the sugar and Fig. 6 shows a schematic diagram of the saccharide in the binding site. Tyrl2 stacks against one face of the sugar, this type of interaction is common in protein-saccharide complexes (Vyas, 1991). The calcium ion is attached to three of the four loops which bind the saccaride. In the absence of calcium it is likely that one or more of these loops moves out of position thus abolishing saccharide binding.

CONCANAVALIN A-METHYL a-D-MANNOPYRANOSIDE D, although similar to each other, are very different from subunits A and B. 3.4. Packing interactions of the subunits and water network The packing interactions for subunits A and B are very different from those for subunits C and D (Derewenda et al., 1989). For the A and B subunits these occur along the a cell edge and are crucially dependent on the water network around the sugars. O1 and C2 of the saccharide in the A subunit make a total of three van der Waals contacts with Gly224 and Thr226 of the symmetry-related B subunit. C l, O1, C7, C2 and 0 2 of the sugar in the B subunit make a total of six van der Waals contacts with Gly224 and Thr226 of the symmetry-related A subunit. An extensive water structure links the saccharide of one subunit to the saccharide of the symmetry-related subunit. Water molecules form several pentagons, with shared edges, along with atoms from the protein and the sugar occupying some of the vertices. Such pentagonal arrangements of water are common in biological materials and are thought to be especially stable (Saenger, 1982). In the D subunit WG bridges between 0 2 of the sugar and Asn69 O of the symmetry-related D subunit. C1, O1 and C7 of the D subunit sugar make a total of five van der Waals contacts with Asn69 of the symmetryrelated D subunit. In the C subunit, WB is bound to 0 2 of the sugar and makes a hydrogen bond to Asp71 OD2 from the symmetry-related C subunit. The saccharide-binding sites of all four subunits in this structure are involved in crystal packing.

Using the classification of Baker & Hubbard (1984) 0 2 , 03, 0 4 and 0 6 all form cooperative hydrogen bonds. 0 4 and 0 6 form a bidentate hydrogen bond with the carboxylic acid group of Asp208, and 0 5 and 0 6 form a bidentate hydrogen bond with backbone amide N atoms of Leu99 and Tyr100. The van der Waals contacts are particularly extensive for the region of the saccharide defined by 03, 04, C6 and 06. The surface accessbility of the saccharide decreases from 370 to 100 A2 when it binds to the protein. The major losses of accessibility occur at the aforementioned atoms and C7. This can be contrasted with the situation for ribose-binding protein (Mowbray & Cole, 1992) where the sugar is completely occluded from solvent binding. The differences between the four saccharide sites occur in the water network surrounding 0 2 and 0 3 and, to a lesser extent, O1 of the sugar. These networks are involved in crystal packing. Subunits A and B share the same network whilst subunits C and

3.5. Metal sites Each concanavalin A monomer contains two metal sites denoted S1 and $2. These are separated by 4.2-4.3 A in the A, B and D subunits but by 4.6 A in the C subunit. The S 1 sites are occupied by M n 2+ and the $2 sites by Ca 2+. In all four subunits the coordination about the manganese ion is basically octahedral. Table 6 shows the bond distances for each ligand. The standard deviation is given for the average length of each metal-ligand bond. This is not really an error limit but a measure of consistency between the subunits. WA is hydrogen bonded to WD (a calcium ligand) at a distance of 2.8-3.2 A, to Va132 O (2.8-3.1 A) and to G l u 8 0 E 1 (2.7-2.8 A). WB is hydrogen bonded to Ser34 OG (2.7-2.8 A) and to another water molecule. The temperature factors quoted in Table 7 for each ligand show that the temperature factor of the metal is close to the

Using an upper limit of 2.8 A for a calciumoxygen bond for a bidentate carboxylic group (Einspahr & Bugg, 1981) the calcium ion is seven coordinate in the A, B, and D subunits but six coordinate in the C subunit. The individual ligand bond distances are shown in Table 8 and the temperature factors are shown in Table 9. The temperature factors show a similar distribution to that observed for the manganese ion. In the A, B and D subunits the calcium has pseudo octahedral geometry with Asp l0 binding in a bidentate manner capping the sixth vertex of an octahedron. In the C subunit Ca 2+ coordination appears to be octahedral, however, errors in bond distances mean the calcium may be seven coordinate. WC is hydrogen bonded to Asp208 O at a distance of 2.9-3.0 A and to Asp208 OD2 (2.5-2.8/k). WD is hydrogen bonded to Arg228 O (2.8-3.0 A) and to WA (Mn 2+ ligand) (2.9-3.0/k). It is the WC interaction with Asp208 which is thought to stabilize the cis peptide (Hardman, Agarwal & Freiser, 1982). 3.6. Comparison to saccharide-free concanavalin A Full details of the refined 2.0 A structure of saccharide-free concanavalin A at 2.0 A resolution have been reported firstly for (Cd, Ca) (Naismith et al., 1993) and secondly, native (Weisgerber &

Helliwell, 1993) concanavalin A. These refinements were performed against synchrotron film data (a = 1.488 ,~), and synchrotron Laue 'toast-rack' film data (~'min = 0 . 5 A and /~max = 0.9 A), respectively. The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry codes 1CON and 2CTV, respectively). Refinement at 1.6 A resolution of the (Co, Ca) saccharide-free crystal structure, against synchrotron image-plate data (a = 1.009 A), and refinement at 2.0 A resolution of the (Ni, Ca) concanavalin A structure, against R-AXIS llc Cu Ka image-plate data, has also now been completed (Emmerich et al., 1994). These structures are essentially the same, apart from differences in the case of Cd-substituted concanavalin A due to the larger ionic radius of the cadmium ion (Naismith et al., 1993) and the improved precision of the 1.6 A structure refinement. The Protein Data Bank codes for the 2.0A (Ni, Ca) and the 1.6 A (Co, Ca) structures are 1SCR and 1SCS, respectively. The saccharide-free structure crystallizes in the space group 1222 and the asymmetric unit contains one monomer. A similar tetramer to that shown in Fig. 1 exists for the saccharide-free structure although the monomers are related by crystallographic rather than non-crystallographic twofold axes. A superposition of the tetramers indicates that the precise organization of the tetramer is subtly different in the two structures. The differences can be represented as three distinct movements which are shown schematically in Fig. 7. In the saccharide-free structure the monomers are more tightly packed together than in the complex. Hence the number of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts at subunit interfaces is approximately 35% higher than in the mannoside complex. There are fewer changes for the A B and CD dimers than for the AC and BD dimers. The fold of the concanavalin A monomer is essentially unchanged by saccharide binding and the saccharide-free monomer superimposes onto each of the monomers in the mannoside complex with an r.m.s, deviation of 0.4 A for all backbone atoms and less than 0.2 A for residues in/3-sheets. A residue-by-

JAMES H. N A I S M I T H et al. residue comparison of the mannoside complex and the saccharide-free structure shows several differences in individual amino-acid conformations remote from the saccharide-binding site. The largest of these is centred at Trp182. In the saccharide-free structure Trp182 adopts an uncommon conformation (as defined by McGregor, Islam & Sternberg, 1987) due to crystal packing effects [these effects are discussed in detail elsewhere (Naismith et al., 1993)]. In the absence of these packing constraints in the mannoside-concanavalin A complex, Trp182 is found in a more common contbrmation. The change at Trp182 affects the surrounding protein structure. The comparison at the saccharide-binding site is complicated because in both this structure and the saccharide-free structure the binding sites are involved in crystal packing. A superposition of the sites is shown in Fig. 8. The main-chain positions are very similar in both structures, however the conformation of several of the side chains has altered. Tyrl00 is directly affected in a major way by saccharide binding whereby it rotates out of the saccharidebinding site to avoid steric clashes with the sugar. Tyrl 2 does move slightly towards the saccharide site, to form van der Waals interactions with the sugar. The differences in the other side chains in the binding site, particularly Leu99 and Arg228, although bigger than for Tyrl2, could well be due to the different packing interactions. In the saccharide-free structure, water molecules and the side chain of AspT1, from a neighbouring molecule in the crystal, fill the binding site and form hydrogen bonds with the same residues as does the sugar. This is shown in Fig. 9. The three waters expelled, interacted with Asnl4 ND2, Leu99 N and Tyrl00 N and are replaced by 04, 0 5 and 0 6 of the sugar (see also Table 4 and Fig. 4). The metal-ligand distances at S1 and $2 for the mannoside-bound and saccharide-free structures are given in Tables 6 and 8. At S1 in the saccharide-free case the ligands sit at the vertices of an almost perfectly regular octahedron with an average distance of 2.20 (3)A. However, in the saccharidebound case, although the average distance is very similar, there is clearly a larger range of ligand distances [2.23 (13)A]. The largest difference is for the distance from manganese to the ligand His24 NE2 which increases by 0.26 (10)/k. There is also a larger range of ligand distances to the Ca [2.40 (16)A] in the saccharide-bound case compared with the saccharide-free case [2.38 (6) A]. The largest difference is for the distance from the calcium to the ligand Aspl0 (OD1) which increases by 0.28 (13)A. Finally, the S I to $2 distances are increased slightly in binding of saccharide to 4.2-4.3/k in the A, B and D subunits (4.6/k in C) compared with 4.17 (1)/k in

the saccharide-free structure. These differences are, however, at the limit of the present analysis, particularly of the mannoside--concanavalin A refinement. An even higher resolution study would be of interest, therefore. The temperature factors of the structures are dramatically different. The average temperature factor for the 1222 structure is 19 A 2, considerably lower than that observed for any subunit in the mannoside complex. However the average temperature factor of the saccharide-binding loops can be compared with the average for a whole subunit (Table 10). According to this analysis saccharide binding does not significantly affect the ordering of the binding loops relative to the bulk of the structure.

4. Concluding remarks
The results of the 2.9/k study of Derewenda et al. (1989) with respect to the saccharide-binding site, detailing how each sugar is bound to the protein by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, are confirmed. In addition however, due to the higher resolution of this study, we have been able to resolve the methyl substituent on the saccharide. Moreover, we have been able to locate a water ligand to the calcium ion, which is involved in stabilization of the cis peptide bond between Ala207 and Asp208, in the saccharide-complex structure. Also, the surface accessibility of the saccharide molecule decreases from 370 to 100 ,~2 when it binds to the protein. Comparison of the saccharide complex at 2.0 A with the saccharide-free structure of concanavalin A (cobalt substituted at the transition-metal site) at 1.6 A reveals considerable structural information. Overall, in the saccharide complex the tetramer association is different in that the monomers in the tetramer tend to separate by up to 0.9/k resulting in only 65% of the inter-subunit interactions seen in the saccharide-free structure. Moreover, the average temperature factor of the mannoside complex is considerably higher (32 A 2) than that of the saccharidefree protein (19 A2). Evidently there is an overall loosening of the structure on binding of the saccha-
