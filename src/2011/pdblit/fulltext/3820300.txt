STRUCTURAL STUDIES ON THE TROPOMYOSIN/TROPONIN COMPLEX OF VERTEBRATE SKELETAL MUSCLE

DAVID A.D. PARRY Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biophysics, Massey University, Palmerston N0rth, New Zealand. Received January 4,1974

Summary:- It has been shown that there is a 29~ periodicity in the C-terminal half of the sequence of rabbit tropomyosin. This period, which is found in the surface apolar residues and in some of the positively and negatively charged residues, may be related to the axial separation of actin molecules in the thin filaments of vertebrate skeletal muscle. The types of interactions between tropomyosin and actin during the contraction/relaxation process are suggested. It has also been shown that the two chains of tropomyosin are most probably staggered with respect to one another by either 7 or 14 residues. Troponin appears to bind to tropomyosin either i00 or 150~ from the N terminus of tropomyosin indicating that the homologous cysteine sequence is not implicated directly in the tropomyosin/troponin interaction. Rabbit tropomyosin has been well characterised as a result of extensive physical and structural studies (1-6). It may form crystals or tactoids and

in most cases, the molecules bond head to tail to a form a continuous polar filament. It has been shown (7-10) that troponin (consisting of three chains

known as TN-T (MW~37,000), TN-I (MW~23,000) and TN-C (MW~18,000)) binds to one tropomyosin molecule and that the head to tail assembly of this regulatory complex is located in the grooves of the actin helix (11-13). Also in vertebrate

skeletal muscle, the tropomyosin may move in the groove of the actin helix (14-16) depending on the amount of Ca 2+ bound by the TN-C component of troponin. Results have been obtained (2,18) which indicate that the antiparallel pair of molecules comprising the basic unit in the Mg-tactoid has a 28~ axial period. This infers that each molecule has an axial (or psuedo axial) period of about 28~ (i/14th the length of the molecule) or 56~ (I/7th the length of the molecule). The axial periodicity between actin monomers in the thin filaments is about 27~. These results suggest that a 28~ periodicity may be present in the rabbit tropomyosin sequence (6).

Hodges et al

(6) have postulated that Series I and Series II interactions are continuous across the region where the single stranded chains overlap. It follows that

moleculam weight of rabbit tmopomyosln is therefore either 62,100 or 63~710 (mean residue weight 115). It would be surprising if this 19½residue (29~) periodicity bore no relationship to the same axial period between actin molecules in the thin filaments of muscle. It is possible that tl~pomyosin may interact with actin

molecules along each of the two strands of the actin helix or that the tropomyosin molecules in each groove of the actin helix ame in axial register (18). In the latter case, the two sets of tl-opomyosin/actin interactions will It is also possible that the 29~ period represents

a psuedo period of a longer repeating unit but there is not sufficient data yet to test this possibility. Parry and Squire (16) have shown that there is a relative movement of about 15~ between actin and tropomyosin on activation of vertebrate skeletal muscle. The role of conserved and variable linkages in protein interactions in general and of the tropomyosin in the groove of the actin helix in particulam has been discussed (5,17,18). Equal periodicities along the actin helix and the

tmopomyosin mean that quasi-equivalent salt linkages could be formed between actin and seven (or fouJoteen) points along tropomyosin. Since these would be

formed between long and flexible side chains, they could be maintained even over a 15~ displacement. On the other hand, apolar interactions a~e non specific

and the periodicity of these residues on tropomyosin might correspond to an apolar stripe on the surface of actin. Relative movement may occur without

g~ossly changing the strength of the interactions.

(6), the total number of interactions has been calculated for relative chain staggers of 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 residues (Table III). Staggers of 7, 14 and 21

two chains of tmopomyosin were staggered by 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 residues with respect to one another have now been calculated. One dimensional Pattersons

were calculated from the model data and compared with that obtained experimentally Relative staggers between chains of 0, 7 om I~ residues were compatible with the data though staggers of 21 or 28 residues were not. Since (a) there is

no evidence that two stranded regions of tropomyosin molecules overlap in the cmystals (5, 18) and (b) it is difficult to vlsualise how head to tail interactions could be made if the chains were not displaced with respect to one another allowing single strand overlap, it seems that the possible stagEer between chains is restricted to either 7 or 14 residues. chosen by HodEes et al (6) from packin E considerations.

Secondly, it has been found (20) that tPoponln may be dissociated from tmopomyosln by the use of mercumial compounds. This may implicate the

cysteine residues in some way with the bindinE to tropomyosin to troponln. If this conclusion is confirmed, it might be expected that there would be little

microheterogeneity in the sequence in the vicinity of the cysteine residue. However, the opposite is true. In the C-terminal half of the

molecule (143 residues), there are 15 substitutions, 5 of which occur within an 8 residue span encompassing CYS-49. This does not eliminate the possibility

of troponin binding near the homologous cysteine sequence but it does seem sumprising that such a high percentage of the substitutions in the C-terminal half of the chain should occum at this point. Since troponin is known to bind

to tropomyosin at a distance of about 25-40~ (5, 18) from the 2-fold axis distant from the brush end of the Mg-tactoids it follows from the initial assumption that the brush end corresponds to the C-terminus of the molecule and that the homologous cysteine sequence is not implicated directly in the troponin binding. Thirdly, one interpretation of the meridional Patterson function places the average position of the homologous and "substituted" cysteine residues about 80~ and 165~ respectively from a 2-fold axis. Precise values for the homologous

cysteine residues place them 80, 75 and 86~ 71 and 92~ from a 2-fold axis for relative chain staggers of 0, 7 and 14 residues respectively. Since Hodges

et al (6) have shown that the cysteine residue is found 95 residues (~142~) from the C-terminus and the 2-fold axis at the brush end of the tactoid is about 70 ± 8~ from the end of the molecules (18), the distance of the homologous cysteine residue from the end of the molecule can be calculated for each stagger (0, 7 and 14 residues) and shown to be consistent with the sequence data. Consequently, both the substituted cysteine residue and the troponin must be about 25-40~ from the 2-fold axis distant from the "brush" end of the tactoid. It is not known whether the "substituted" cysteine and the troponin binding site are the same side of the 2-fold axis though the dissociation data (20) Once again, this implies that the C-terminus It should be

noted that an alternative solution to the Patterson function places the homologous cysteine sequence at or very close to a 2-fold axis. This position

is compatible with the sequence data providing that the brush end of the

Mg-tactoid corresponds to the N-terminus of the tropomyosin molecule.
Several workers have shown that troponin binds to tropomyosin at a position about one third the distance from the end'~of the molecule (5,7). Greaser et al (8) have suggested that troponin binds at the end of tropomyosin but this is clearly inconsistent with studies on the Mg tactoids complexed with troponin. Ebashi et al (7) believe that troponin is about 130~ from the C-term-

inal end of tropomyosin assuming that aderivative of dextran sulphate (a polyanion) links the N-terminal ends of the molecules. It is now known

(6) that the N-terminus is acetylated which throws some doubt on the validity of this assumption. From similar reasoning, it might be predicted that

The results presented here suggest (but do

not prove) that the troponin is about I00 or 150~ from the N-terminal end of tropomyosin. The findings may be summarised as follows: (a) the "surface" apolar residues and some of the positively and negatively

charged residues show a periodicity (or psuedo periodicity) of about 29~. This indicates the type of interactions that might occur as tropomyosin slides across actin during the contraction~relaxation process (b) the polar
