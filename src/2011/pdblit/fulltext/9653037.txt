The crystal structure of phage 434 Cro protein in complex with a 20 base-pair D1VA fragment has been determined to 2.5 A resolution. The DNA fragment contains the sequence of the OR1 operator site. The structure shows a bent conformation for the DNA, straight,er at the center and more bent at the ends. The central base-pairs adopt conformations with significant deviations from coplanarity. The two molecules interact extensively along their common interface, both through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. The for operator binding and recognition is discussed. significance of these interactions

1. Introduction
The repressor and Cro proteins of phage 434 bind to a set of six related operator sites in the phage genome (denoted Oal-Oa3, O,l-0,3). Affinities of t.he two proteins for these six sites differ in such a way as to create an efficient regulatory switch 1986). Measurements of binding to (Ptashne, natural and synthetic operator sequences in vitro have established the essential outlines of differential recognition (Wharton et al., 1984; Koudelka et al., 1987, 1988). In brief, (1) a 434 operator site is a 14 base-pair sequence with the 4 base-pair element 5'-ACAA at either end; (2) the central six base-pairs of an operator site modulate its affinity for both repressor and Cro: (3) Cro differs from repressor in binding with nearly equal athnity to sites with 5'-ACAG and 5'-ACAA. Structural st,udies of the two proteins, alone and in complex with synthetic operator DNA, have begun to establish the mechanism by which these relative affinities are established. The 434 Cro and repressor DNA-binding domains are very similar, both in amino acid sequence and in threedimensional fold (Mondragon et al., 1989aJ). Both contain the now familiar helix-turn-helix motif. Two structures have been determined for complexes of the DSA-binding domain of 434 repressor, denoted Rl-69, with synthetic operators: a moderateresolution structure with a 14 base-pair fragment

having a symmetric sequence related to 0,s ("14-mer": Anderson et al., 1987) and a highresolution structure with a 20 base-pair fragment cont'aining the Oal sequence (Aggarwal et a,l., 1988). Both structures show that, two RI-69 monomers bind nearly symmetrically to an operator. Each tnonomer interacts with a half-site, and contacts between monomers create a significant dimer interface. A bound Rl-69 dimer fixes an operator in a overwound at its center and bent conformation, underwound near its ends. A significant narrowing of the minor groove occurs near the center. Contacts in the major groove between side-chains of the helix-turn-helix and groups on base-pairs 1 through 4 determine recognition of the 5'-ACAA element. Afhnity for different operators appears t'o depend on the ease with which the central nucleotIides can adopt. the required DNA conformat.ion. since there is no direct contact to the central four base-pairs. Aggarwal et (~2. (1988) have advanced specific proposals concerning the significance for different'ial affinity- of the non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds that can be made by non-coplanar base-pairs. A structure, determined at. moderate resolution for the complex of 434 Cro with the symmetric lbmer (Wolberger et al., 1988) showed a conformat'ion for the operator significantly different from that found in the complex with Rl-69. In particular, the 14-mer appeared straighter and more uniformly overwound when bound to Cro than when bound to Rl-69, and narrowing of the minor groove near the operator center was less pronounced than in the Rl-69 complex. The most obvious effect of the conformational differences on protein/DNA contacts was observed in the region near base-pair

4, where the DNA backbone was much closer to the helix 2/helix 3 turn in Cro than to the turn in Rl-69. On the basis of these observations, Wolberger et al. (1988) suggested that the difference in imposed DNA conformations is critical to the different binding site "preferences" exhibited by the two proteins. To test this proposal, by examining the precise conformational differences between DNA operators in the two complexes, requires a higher-resolution structure than that afforded by the Cro/lkmer crystals. We report here the analysis at, 2.5 A resolution (1 A = 0.1 nm) of a complex between 434 Cro and the same (&-containing 20 base-pair fragment previously studied in complex with Rl-69. The structure shows that the conformation of the operator bound to Cro is indeed significantly different from its conformation when bound to Rl-69, but less extensively so than suggested earlier. The central 14 base-pairs in the 20 base-pair fragment closely resemble the 14-mer in complex with Cro (Wolberger et al., 1988), but the ends of the fragment curl around the Cro dimer t'o generate an overall bend very similar to that seen in the Rl-69 complex. Previous conclusions about differential bending by the two proteins (Koudelka et al., 1988; Wolberger et al., 1988) must therefore be revised. The high-resolution structure also shows how 434 (:ro establishes the observed operator conformation, and suggests that a number of differences between repressor and Cro, many of them not in helix 3, are important for differential recognition.

2. Experimental Methods
(a) C'rystals and data collection

Overproduction and purification of 434 Cro protein for crystallization have been described (Wolberger, 1987). DNA was purchased from PL-Biochemicals. The sequence is shown in Fig. 1. It is identical to that used in studies of a complex with Rl-69 (Aggarwal et al.. 1988). The central 14 base-pairs correspond precisely to 0,l. The oligonucleotide has unpaired bases at the 5' end of each strand, so that base-pairs can form when adjacent fragments stack in a crystal (Jordan et al.. 1985). Crystals were

The structure was solved by molecular replacement. The model of 434 Cro complexes with a 14 base-pair fragment (Wolberger et wl., 1988) was used as a starting search model. The fast rotation function (Crowther, 1972) showed 2 clear solutions, corresponding to the 2 possible orientat,ions of the complex around its pseudo X-fold axis. Both were used in translation R-factor searches (Bhuiya & Stanley, 1964). The solutions from both searches were virtually indistinguishable by R-factor. which was 43.8% to 3.0 A for the slightly better orientation. At this stage. the 20 base-pair model of DKA from the Rl-69 complex structure was exchanged for the 14 base-pair model. The R-factor remained almost unchanged (4459/h). To study the packing arrangement, the resulting model obtained was displayed using the program FRODO (Jones. 1978) on an Evans and Sutherland PS390 graphics station. The packing was reasonable, with the DKA molecules stacked to form a pseudo-continuous helix with overhanging ends paired. P;o unacceptable contact was found. The new model was refined with the program CORELS (Sussman et al., 1977), first treating it as a rigid body and then breaking it into smaller and smaller subunits. The resolution was increased from 5 to 2.8 x in several steps. The final R-factor to 38 A was 26!/,. The alternative orientation of the model was refined in the same way to a final R-factor of 28%. The better model was studied and rebuilt using FRODO. After rebuilding, it was refined with the TNT suite of programs of Tronroud et al. (1987). The model was rebuilt several more times and the resolu-

Finally. maps phased with only the 14 base-pairs corresponding to t'he 0,l sequence were computed. The density for the remaining 6 base-pairs was clear and consistent wqth the model. The final R-factor for data between 10 and 2.5 A is 22%, using a model with 25 solvent molecules.

3. Results
(a) Overall structure of the complex
The complex is shown in Figure 3. Each Cro monomer interacts principally with one half-site. The helix-turn-helix is positioned so that t'he amino t,erminus of helix 2 interacts with the DXA backbone on one side of the major groove and the turn and helix S/helix 4 loop interact with the backbone on t'he other side of the groove. Helices 4 and 5 cont'ribute to the dimer interface. Despite asymmetries in the central and flanking sequences, the DNA backbone is almost' symmetric with respect to the pseudo dyad that relates one half-site to the other. The best least-squares superposition of sugar-phosphate backbone atoms in one half-site ont'o corresponding atoms in the other yields an r.m.s. difference in at,omic positions of 1.21 Lt and a rotation angle about the best axis of 180". A surprising result is that when the protein monomers are superposed, the r.m.s. difference in atomic positions is 0.61 A, but the required rotation angle is 174.6". Thus, the DNA backbone has a structural 2-fold, coincident with t'he pseudo 2-fold of the operator sequence, but t'he protein monomers are not related by this dyad. The asymmetry is not pronounced, but there are necessarily small differences in the way the two monomers inttaract with their half-sites. We have adopted the following numbering scheme to describe the structure. consistent with

The final model of the 1st solution was used as a starting point, but with the DKA in the opposite orientation. The model was extensively refined to an R-factor of 24%. At this stage, maps with 2lF,,I - IF,1 and

IJ'J - IB'J coefficients were computed. The maps, although

conformation

The DNA forms a R-type helix, with a mean rise of 3.24 A per base step and a mean twist, of 36.1" per turn, corresponding to i.en bases per t,urn as in canonical B-DSA. All the sugars in our model have the C'-2'.endo conformation, because of constraints imposed during the refinement, but' there is no evidence from difference maps at this resolution for any deviation from C-2'.endo. The r.m.s. values for the backbone angles are given above. The 5'-terminal bases in b0t.h strands are paired with bases in crystallographically related molecules, and the stacked fragments thus form a pseudocontinuous helix that runs along the unit-cell diagonal. The overview of the complex in Figure 3 shows that the D2iA is bent. The space curve in Figure 4, representing the locus of center of mass of the 19 base-pairs within a fragment, shows that curvature is concentrated at the ends of the operator. The central 14 base-pairs of the present struct#ure superpose well on the co-ordinates of the 14-mer in

complex wit'h 434 Cro (r.m.s. difference for backbone, 1.1 A). reported in a previous account, from this laboratory. Tn that paper (Wolberger et al., 1988), the DNA was described as relatively straight. Adjacent 14-mers in those crystals do. however, stack in such a way that' they mimic rather accurately t,he curvature at the ends of the 20 base-pairs fragment (Fig. 5). Because the stacking varies somewhat a.t the six crystallographically distinct junctions, the extent. to which it reveals the curvature in a rontinuous fragment was not recognized in the earlier analysis (Wolberger et ab., 1988). Base-pairs in the operator are significantly noncoplanar (Table 2 and Fig. 6). In the Rl-69/0,1 complex, base-pair non-coplanarity was observed to give rise to a pat,tern of bifurcated hydrogenbonding (Aggarwal et al.. 1988). Non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds between adjacent bases on opposite strands might compensate for thr distortion of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds when base-pairs are propeller twisted or buckled. We can assign at least one bifurcated hydrogen bond at t'hr center of OR1 in the Cro complex. The differences bet.ween the DNA backbone conformations near phosphate 4' in the two complexes are such that, identical patterns of non-coplanarity are not likely. As shown in Figure 6, thymine 7'1, and adenine 6L are linked by a bifurcated hydrogen bond in the major groove.

In thin lines is shown the 14 base-pair DSA and its 2 adjacent non-c:rystallogrsphic:ttllS symmetry-related neighbors, from the structure presented by Wolberger it al. (1988). The DKA in the 2 structures is very similar and bends in the same manner. The stacked DK'A molecules in t,he 14 base-pair structure follow rlosely the path of the 20 base-pair DNjA.

Less favorable minor-groove linkages can be considered for guanine 51, and thymine 4'L in the L half-site, and guanine 6'R and thymine 7R in t'he R8 half-site. Tn all three cases, large propeller twists of the base-pairs bring the releva.nt, groups into proximity.

Helices 2 and 3 form the Comparison of the motif. helix-turn-helix complexed and free proteins shows that there is no major change in conformation upon binding t'o

DXA. The principal changes occur in torsion angles of side-chains that lose or acquire important interactions on binding; i.e. side-chains that interact wit'h symmet'ry-related molecules in the crystals of' free Cro and those that, contact DNA or help form the dimer interface. Tn helix 3. residues 27. 28, 29 and 32 change conformation and cont,act the DNA. Phenylalanine 46 changes conformation and fits into the dimer interface, and arginine 43 and glutamic acid 47 move t)o form a salt-bridge between monomers. In the structure of the free prot'ein, only the first 65 of t~he 71 residues are ordered. In the complex, one of the monomers (R) has 63 ordered residues and the other (T,) 66. The ordered residue at the carboxyl terminus of the L monomer is held in place by a crystallographic contact.

The high degree of non-coplanarit? of the bases is apparent. giving rise t,o non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds (broken lines) between adjacent base-pairs. Similar networks have been observed in other structures (Nelson et al.. 1987; Aggarwal et al., 1988). The hydrogen-bond networks in the 434 C'ro complex and in the RI-69 complex are somewhat different. although the sequence and overall bending of the 0,l DNA is the same in the 2 comldexes.

interfacr

The interface has a hydrophobic core, dominated by the bulky side-chains of phenylalanine 46 and tyrosine 61. and polar networks at its lateral margins. Residues in helices 4 and 5 and in the loop connecting helixes 3 and 4 contribute to the contact. The posit,ion of phenylalanine 46 is incompatible with a perfect, 2-fold. That is, the phenyl groups on

monomers related by the best Dr\`A dyad would collide (Fig. 7). This interference probably cont'ributes to t,he generation of asymmetry. Arginine 41 and tyrosine 61 from one subunit and glut)amate 47 from the other form a small net,work of hydrogen bonds. Side-chains of these residues have different conformations on either side of the approximat'e dyad. although the patt,erns of polar bonding are similar (Fig. 7).

All the parameters were calculated from the final, refined model. The values of the rise and twist are affected by local variations in the structure, and thus serve only as a guide. Local twist and rise were c&ulatrd using the program HELIX; propeller twist and bucklr were calculated with the pro~r&*~ l%ROl,l, (Dickerson & Drew, 1981).

of helix 2. The bending is more apparent at the ends of the D1CA fragment. Figure 4 shows a plot of the center of mass of the base-pairs for the 20 base-pair fragment and for straight B-DNA with ten base-pairs per turn. It is clear that most of the bending occurs at the ends, although there are deviations throughout the fragment. The degree of bending is comparable t)o that observed in the Rl-69 complex with the same DNA fragment (Aggarwal et al., 1988) and to the bending that can be recognized in the Rl-69 and Clro complexes with a shorter piece of DNA (Anderson et al.. 1987: Wolberger et al., 1988). In the latt)er structure. the bending was not originally noticed because of the shortness of the DNA and the variation in structure arising from the unusual packing arrangements. E'evertheless, when the two Cro complexes are compared, it is clear that they have similar bent DNA conformations (see Fig. 5). Gel retardation measurements have been used to assess DNA bending by 434 repressor and Cro in Recent experiments (G. Koudelka, solution. personal communication) show equivalent bending by the two proteins and require revision of the earlier interpretation (Koudelka et ~2.. 1988) that 434 Cro bends DSA much less than does repressor. The new experimental measurement's are consistent with t,he cryst'allographic results reported here. (ii)

narrowing of t'he minor groove at the center of the operator is probably stabilized by the two arginine 43 side-chains, which project between the phosphate backbones. The major groove is more regular. The in its width are all within 1 A of t,he mean variations value of 17.62 B; the expected value for standard B-DNA is 17.5 A (S aenger, 1984). The minor groove variations for the Cro complex are less marked than for the Rl-69 complex, which shows an even larger et al.: narrowing of the minor groove (Aggarwal 1988). This difference is due to a relative shift in the position of phosphate 4'. In the Cro complex, this phosphate lies near the helix S/helix 3 t,urn and forms hydrogen bonds with the peptide nitrogen atom of lysine 27 and the Oy of serine 30. In the Rl-69 complex. it shifts about 1 to 2 ,A into the minor groove and away from the protein. (iii)
Raw-pair non-coplanarity

Width of mc~jor and minor

grooves

The minor groove varies in width. It' is narrower at the center of the operat,or and wider at the ends. The width has a low value of 9.3 A betweeen phosphat,e groups 71, and 3% and a mean of 10.4 a for the central four base-pairs; its highest value, near the ends of the operator, is 13.7 A. The overall mean of 11.4 A is in good agreement with the expected value for B-DNA (11.5 .&: Saenger, 1984). The

The base-pairs at the center of the operator show large deviations from planarity (Fig. 6). One consequence is the presence of bifurcated three-centered hydrogen bonds in adjacent pairs. Such threecentered bonds ha,ve been observed in other structures having t'hree or more adenine residues in sequence (Nelson et al., 1987; Aggarwal et al., 1988). More recently, they have also been observed in GC tracts (Timsit et al., 1989), showing that it is possible to have significant non-coplanarity in nonAT-rich sequences. In all cases, a large propeller twist is present in the base-pairs involved. We have considered three possible bifurcated hydrogen bonds in the Cro/O,l complex. One, between thymine 7'1, and adenine 6L, joins groups in the major groove; the other two, of less favorable geometry, involve guanine 6'R/thymine 7R and guanine 5L/thymine 4'L and join groups in the minor groove. The central base-pairs in the Rl-69 complex also form bifur-

Adenine 1 forms hydrogen bonds to glutamine 28: guanine 2' forms a hydrogen bond to glutamine 29. Some of t,he hydrogen-bonding distances are rather long. but we note that t'hey are present in complexes of Rl-69 with C&l and C&3. as well as in the (`ro/O,l structure described here. Moreover. an?; base-pair substitutions would lead to substantially less favorahle cortt,acts, with full?; unsat,isfied hydrogen-bond donors. In Rl-69 complexes. t,wo hydrogen bonds are found between glut.amine 29 and guanine 2, but only one is found here. The sidecahain conformations of glutamine 28 and glutamine 29 are critical for correct hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contacts; both are different from what is observed in free 434 Cro. They are held in place by bonds to other groups in the protein: hydrogen glutamine 28 to the side-chain carborryl group of residue 17 and glutamine 29 t'o its own peptidr nitrogen at,om. The multiple hydrogen-bonding caapacity of glut,amine is therefore essential for generating the networks found in this and the Rl-69

Complex at 2.5 A Resolution effects of sequence on a specific, local conformation. There are a number of ways in which a sequence of, say, ten base-pairs can generate approximately the same net twist or bend. By contrast, the conformation at the renter of ORI is constrained by the requirement that, it has a particular t,otal twist and, more importantly, by a series of interactions that precisely determine the positions of phosphate groups 4', 5' and 6'. and that' also bear on deoxyriboses 5' and 6'. Tt is the influence of the sequence on t.he free energy of the actual conformation. rather t,han the sequence dependence of the larger ensemble of all conformations with t,he same net twist or bend, that we must understand. In analyzing the central base-pairs in the Rl-69/O,] complex. Aggarwat et al. (1988) called attention to base-pair non-coplanarity in the bifurcated hydrogen bonds that can result. Do these hydrogfbn bonds. of admittedly rather marginal geometry, make measurable contribut'ions t,o the overall free energy of the operator, or is optimization of base-pair stacking a quantitat.ively more significant effect! The present. structure does not permit a de6nit.e distinction. It does show base-pair geornetries that "take advantage" of possibilities for forming bifurcated hydrogell bonds. These are different from the three-center bonds found in t'he RI-69/O,] complex. probably reflecting a difference in the operat,or backbone conformation near phosphate 4'. The observation that Rl-69 and 434 (:ro exhibit, a similar dependence of binding on central base-pair sequence suggests that operator adjust,merits to improve stacking may be at' least as important as specific hydrogen-bonding. In conclusion. two general points emerge from analysis of t,his structure and from comparison with the 434 repressor complex. (1) Int,erac%ions with invariant, base-pairs are conserved. The two proteins dock similarly on the operator and recognize base-pairs l t'hrough 3 in the same way, by contacts from conserved residues. The small differences that, we do observe. for example in distances and inferred strengths for hydrogen bonds, do not contradict t'hr basic notion that there are essentially identical mechanisms for discriminating against substitutions at base pairs I through 3. (2) Differential recognition at the critical position 4 in the operator involves more t.han a local substitution of amino acid residues in helix 3. Contacts at this base-pair depend on differences in I>NA conformation brtwtlen the two eomplexrs. and the), therefore involve widely distributed amino acid substit'utions. The phage 434 genetic switch thus appears to involl-e straightforwardly conserved interactions for ident'ical sp&icitirs. but' unanticipatedly distributed differences for divergent speGfic+ics. Tn t,hr case of repressor and Cro from bac*tcriophage 1. there has been a long-standing debate. caoncerning thr validity of point (1): do conserved residues make conserved cont,actsY (Hochschild &. Ptashne. 1986; Ohlrndnrf pt al.. 1982). The L regulatory proteins are similar only in their helix-turn-helix regions, and the clivrrgrnc<L of' st,ruct'ure elsewherc~ in their

for G.C (G. Koudelka. creates a "preference" R. Wharton & $1. Ptashne. personal communication). In the present structure, C6 of leucine 33 lies in the crevice between the methyl group and O-6 of the thymine 4'. A glutamine extended as in the RI-69/(&l complex (Aggarwal et al., 1988) could not be inserted without some re-arrangement. Thus, even in two complexes as closely related as those of 434 repressor and Cro with O,l, the base-pair specificit,y implied by the identity of residue 33 depends criticall: on t,he precise local geometry of t.he prot,ein/I>hA interface. Leucine at position 33 in 434 Cro is not equivalent to leucine at position 33 in 434 repressor. Moreover, the contacts that set up the precise local geometry come from a significant part of the (!ro and Rl-69 molecules. These include the J)NA-backbone interactions described above, which involve residues between 10 and 44, as well as the major groove int'eractions involving helix 3. Thus: differences between the two proteins distributed over a substantial part of their structures appear to have c~onsequenc~esfor differential recognition at base-pair 4. (iii) C'wtral base-pairs There is no major groove contact to base-pairs 5, 6 or 7. The only minor groove contacts are watermediated and involve bonds from the guanidinium group of arpinine 43R to 7'L: 7'R and 6'R (Fig. 9). Both arginine 43 residues are in clear van der Waats contact with fhe sugars of these base-pairs and probably provide a stabilizing electrostatic field. Binding of 434 (`ro responds to central base-pairs changes in essentially the same way as does Rl-69 (Koudrlka e:tul.. 1987): G. C and C. G base-pairs are unfavorable at position 7, and somewhat unfavorable at position 6. The arginine 43 interaction cannot readily accaount for the observations in the case of 434 repressor, since conversion of this residue t,o alanine does not change the pattern of repressor preference (Koudelka et a,Z.:1987). We propose that, as wit'h 434 repressor. t'he central base-pairs influence t,he affinity of 434 Cro by affecting the capacity of an operator to adopt the conformation imposed by the protein, rather than by altering a direct non-covalent contact. What a.sp<Jctsof operator conformation could be involved? There has been some debate about the relativr contributions of hend and twist. Koudelka et al. (1988) argue that bending cannot contribute, on t,he basis of the mistaken observation that 434 (?o dorasnot bend USA. and suggest that resistance to twist is a c~ritic~al factor. Fujimoto & Schurr (1990) challenge this suggestion, pointing out' that measurements of' the dependence of DXA torsional rigidity on bastx composition indicate too small an effect. Although our structure does show a definite bend, we do not I)rlieve that "bendability" provides a useful alternative explanation. The locus of bend is actually distal to base-pair 6 on either side, and t.he opf*rator is relatively straight across its center (Fig. 5). LVe believe that global properties. like t,wist or bend. are not vclry useful ways to analyze the

binding domains could. in principle. lead to different modes of docking on DNA. A direct (nomparison of repressor and Cro complexes from /1 is not yet possible, due to the absence of a high-resolution /1 Cro/operator struct'ure. We suggest, however, that our observations on the homologous 434 prot,eins add a clear precedent to the evidence favoring vonservrd interactions for the common rrcognit,ion pat.terns.
