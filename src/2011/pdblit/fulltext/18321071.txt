Integrin adhesion receptors transduce bidirectional signals across the plasma membrane, with the integrin transmembrane domains acting as conduits in this process. Here, we report the first highresolution structure of an integrin transmembrane domain. To assess the influence of the membrane model system, structure determinations of the 3 integrin transmembrane segment and flanking sequences were carried out in both phospholipid bicelles and detergent micelles. In bicelles, a 30-residue linear R-helix, encompassing residues I693-H772, is adopted, of which I693-I721 appear embedded in the hydrophobic bicelle core. This relatively long transmembrane helix implies a pronounced helix tilt within a typical lipid bilayer, which facilitates the snorkeling of K716's charged side chain out of the lipid core while simultaneously immersing hydrophobic L717-I721 in the membrane. A shortening of bicelle lipid hydrocarbon tails does not lead to the transfer of L717-I721 into the aqueous phase, suggesting that the reported embedding represents the preferred 3 state. The nature of the lipid headgroup affected only the intracellular part of the transmembrane helix, indicating that an asymmetric lipid distribution is not required for studying the 3 transmembrane segment. In the micelle, residues L717-I721 are also embedded but deviate from linear R-helical conformation in contrast to I693-K716, which closely resemble the bicelle structure.

ABSTRACT:

Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric adhesion receptors that bind to extracellular matrix proteins, serum proteins, and coreceptors expressed on the cell surface (1). Many integrins exist in a default low affinity state, and their conversion to the activated form, following the transmission of an activating signal from the cytoplasmic to extracellular domains (inside-out signaling), is vital to an array of physiological processes such as cell migration, extracellular matrix assembly and pathological processes such as inflammation, thrombosis, and tumor metastasis (1). Mutational studies of integrin RIIb- 3 suggested that sequence-specific hydrophobic packing of the transmembrane (TM1) helices and adjacent electrostatic RIIb- 3 interactions on the cytosolic side stabilize the inactive state (2­6). Integrin occupancy by extracellular ligands can also lead to biochemical signaling events and the interaction of integrins with the actin cytoskeleton (outside-in signaling), processes essential to cell adhesion, migration, and anchorage dependent cell growth and survival (1).

have suggested that the disruption of the intersubunit association is also important in this form of signaling (7, 8). Thus, a large body of indirect evidence supports the hypothesis that the integrin transmembrane domains play a direct role in bidirectional integrin signaling. Each R and integrin subunit consists of a large extracellular domain, a single pass transmembrane helix, and a short, C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (1). Across family members and species, the transmembrane helices have a conserved but unusual pattern of hydrophobicity. Each helix contains a stretch of 23 mostly hydrophobic residues that terminates on the intracellular side with a Trp-Lys pair, or similar residue combination. These two residues are followed by a second stretch of several mostly apolar residues (9). While the first segment alone represents an efficient stop-transfer sequence, the snorkeling capability of the long lysine side chain in combination with an unknown membranecrossing angle make the topology of the second segment controversial. Predictive methods suggest it to be cytoplasmic; however, glycosylation mapping studies in microsomal membranes indicate that it may be membrane-embedded (10). These indirect methods have been complemented by the secondary structure characterization of the integrin 3 TM helix in micelles (11). However, the lack of direct structural and topological information concerning the TM helices has so far impeded an in-depth understanding of the signaling events within the membrane. As a starting step, the topology and atomic resolution structure of a peptide corresponding

Structure of the Integrin 3 Transmembrane Segment to the 3 transmembrane segment and flanking sequences are reported here. Structural studies of integral membrane proteins are complicated by the appropriate selection of a membrane model system. This seems particularly relevant for single TM helices since all side chains are exposed to the membrane environment in contrast to proteins composed of multiple TM helices. To assess the implication of the membrane model system, the 3 TM structure and topology have been determined in two media, detergent micelles and phospholipid bicelles. Micelles are composed of detergentlike molecules and generally form approximately spherical particles with a relatively invariant number of detergent molecules (aggregation number) and, hence, size. Following the previous integrin 3 TM study (11), dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles are used and are referred to simply as micelles. Bicelles comprise a small, symmetric lipid bilayer whose rim is stabilized by short-chain lipids (12, 13). The molar ratio of long-chain to short-chain lipids, the q-factor, determines the size of the bicelle bilayer and, hence, the overall size of the bicelle. In the following, the term bicelle is simply used for a q ) 0.3 bicelle composed of glycerophosphatitylcholine-based lipids of 16/18 carbon atom tails (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC) and 6/6 tails (1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DHPC). It is well documented that bicelles of this q-factor form magnetically isotropic particles that exhibit planar geometry (14, 15) characteristic of a small, central long-chain lipid bilayer surrounded by short-chain lipids. Using the bicelle system, we also investigated the effect of the lipid headgroup type on the 3 TM structure and evaluated the appropriateness of an only symmetric lipid distribution. Thus, a detailed analysis of the impact of membrane model systems on helical TM structure is presented, which provides general insight into lipid­protein interactions. Overall, the analysis revealed a strong preference of 3 residues I693-I721 to immerse into the hydrophobic bicelle core, implying a pronounced helix tilt relative to a typical membrane for this 29-residue segment exhibiting linear R-helical structure. The bicelle- and micelle-embedded 3 structures differ significantly because of perceived shortcomings of the micelle environment. The impact of lipid type headgroup and lipid symmetry strongly imply that the reported bicelle-embedded 3 structure corresponds to the native, monomeric 3 TM segment and, therefore, forms the basis for understanding its association with the RIIb TM segment and conformational changes that occur during integrin activation. Moreover, the definition of the 3 structure at the membrane-water interface is crucial for understanding 3 membrane-proximal interactions with cytosolic proteins, such as talin, that effect integrin RIIb- 3 activation (16, 17). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Integrin 3 Expression and Purification. Synthetic oligonucleotides coding for human integrin 3 residues P685F727 were assembled by PCR and subcloned into the pET31 expression vector (Novagen, Inc.) with ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) as N-terminal fusion protein. To avoid peptide aggregation, a C687S substitution was incorporated.

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 13, 2008 4009 Expression was induced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS,T1R cells (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) growing in M9 minimal medium at 37 °C at an OD600 of 1.0 by adding IPTG to 1.0 mM. 2 H/13C/15N isotope labeling was achieved by employing 99% 13 C-D glucose and 99% 15NH4Cl in 99% D2O cultures. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 5 h after induction and lysed by sonication in 50 mM Tris · HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 100 mM SDS, 20 mM imidazole, and 2 mM -mercaptoethanol. The clarified lysate was applied on a HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Amersham, Inc.) charged with Ni2+ for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The column was washed with 50 mM Tris · HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 25 mM SDS, followed by buffer exchange into 50 mM Tris · HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 8 M urea, and 20 mM imidazole and additional washing with an elevated imidazole concentration of 50 mM. After another buffer exchange into 50 mM Tris · HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 6 M guanidine · HCl, and 20 mM imidazole, bound protein was eluted by raising the imidazole concentration to 300 mM. Following ref 18, the 3 peptide was subsequently cleaved from the fusion protein using the intervening acidlabile Asp-Pro peptide bond in 10% formic acid for 120 min at 80 °C, leaving P685 as the N-terminal 3 residue. The 3 peptide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Hamilton PRP-3 column at 60 °C using a linear gradient from 35%/65% buffer A (H2O, 0.1% TFA)/buffer B (80% Acetonitrile, 20% 1-propanol 0.1% TFA) to 80%/20% in 45 min. Peptide purity and mass were verified by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry. NMR Sample Preparation. Freeze-dried peptide was taken up in 320 µL bicelle or micelle solution to give a 3 peptide concentration of 0.6 mM. Unless otherwise stated, bicelles comprised 350 mM DHPC and 105 mM POPC, which resulted in a q-factor of 0.3. Micelles were made up of 450 mM DPC. The solutions were buffered by 25 mM NaH2PO4/ Na2HPO4, pH 6.5, in the presence of 6% D2O and 0.02% w/v NaN3, unless otherwise stated. To illustrate the spectral quality obtained, H-N TROSY spectra of bicelle- and micelleembedded 3 are shown in Supporting Information, Figure 1. To align the 3-bicelle/micelle complexes relative to the magnetic field stretched, negatively charged polyacrylamide gels were used (19, 20). For the 3-micelle complex, a 320 µL gel was polymerized in 150 mM Tris · HCl, pH 8.0, from a 5.6% w/v solution of acrylamide (AA), 2-acrylamido-2methyl-1-propanesulfonate (AMPS) and bisacrylamide (BIS) with a monomer-to-cross-linker ratio of 49:1 (w/w) and a molar ratio of 96:4 of AA to AMPS. For easier comparisons between gels, AMPS is counted as AA in the stated weight ratios (21). For the 3-bicelle complex, two gels of 320 µL volume were prepared using a monomer-to-cross-linker ratio of 49:1 (w/w) and a molar ratio of 94:6 of AA to AMPS. The first gel was polymerized from a 4.6% w/v solution of AA, AMPS, and BIS, whereas a 4.2% solution was used for the second gel. All gels were dialyzed overnight in 50 mL of 100 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, followed by H2O for 10 h and another H2O dialysis overnight. Following the complete drying of the gels, they were soaked in 320 µL of 3-bicelle/micelle solution for 24 h and transferred into openended NMR tubes as described (22). For the 4.2% bicelle gel, the 3 buffer was varied to 25 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, and 0.02% w/v NaN3. The following 2H splittings were observed: 3.2 Hz ( 3-micelle gel at 25 °C), 2.1 Hz

(4.6% 3-bicelle gel at 40 °C), and 1.6 Hz (4.2% 3-bicelle gel at 40 °C). Preparation of Mn2+EDDA. To use paramagnetic Mn2+ without a partitioning bias near polar protein and lipid/ detergent functional groups, it was used in complex with the chelating agent EDDA2- (ethylenediamine-N,N-diacetate). A 0.5 M Na2EDDA solution was combined with a predefined amount of MnCl2 for a final Mn2+EDDA2concentration of 0.5 M and vortexed immediately until a clear solution was obtained. White Mn2+EDDA2- began to precipitate from the solution within a minute. The pelleted complex was washed twice with methanol, followed by ethanol and air-dried. Twenty-five millimolar Mn2+EDDA2stock solutions were prepared freshly in 25 mM HEPES · NaOH, pH 7.0, and 0.02% NaN3 buffer. NMR Spectroscopy. NMR experiments were carried out on a cryoprobe-equipped Bruker Avance 700 spectrometer at 25 °C, except for the gel-aligned bicelle samples, which were measured at 40 °C. Data were processed and analyzed with the nmrPipe package (23) and CARA. Throughout all experiments, the solvent was kept at +Iz whenever possible and TROSY-type H-N detection was used (24). HN, N, CR, C , and C assignments were made from HNCA, HNCACB, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments. HN-HN NOEs were measured using HSQC-NOESY-TROSY experiments with a mixing time of 150 ms. 3JCC and 3JNC couplings for aromatic and aliphatic residues were obtained from quantitative J -correlation spectroscopy (25) with dephasing times of 50 and 100 ms, respectively. 1JNH, 1JCRC, 1JCN, and 1 JNH+1DNH, 1J CRC+1DCRC, 1JCN+1DCN couplings were determined from 1JNH-scaled HNCO experiments (26) and from quantitative J-correlation HNCO experiments (27, 28) on isotropic and aligned samples, respectively. {1H}-15N NOE measurements were carried out using 5 s of presatu-

ration preceded by a recycling delay of 4 s for the NOE experiment and a 9 s recycle delay for the reference experiment. Structure Calculations. Structures of the folded regions of the 3 peptide (residues D692-D723 for bicelle- and D692-H722 for micelle-embedded 3, respectively, c.f. Figure 2B) were calculated by simulated annealing starting at 3000 K using the program XPLOR-NIH (29). The peptide termini were represented by random-coil conformations. The difference between predicted and experimental residual dipolar couplings was described by a quadratic harmonic potential. Dihedral angle restraints were implemented using a quadratic square-well potential and were merely aiding in the convergence of the residual dipolar coupling restraints (RDCs). ,  backbone dihedral angle constraints were extracted from N, CR, C and C chemical shifts using the program TALOS (30). 1 side-chain angle restraints were derived from the 3JCC and 3JNC coupling constants (Supporting Information, Table 2). Backbone-backbone HN-HN NOE distance restraints did not restrict 3 conformations beyond general helical conformational space. A backbonebackbone hydrogen-bonding potential was used (31). A torsion angle potential of mean force (32), which was modified to implement the preferred rotamers in transmembrane helices (33, 34), was employed. Moreover, the higher side chain rotamers ( 2- 4) of K716 were selected to extend toward the C-terminus, i.e., to snorkel. An ensemble of a total of 20 structures was calculated (Supporting Information, Table 1). The structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession numbers 2rmz and 2rn0 for bicelleand micelle-embedded 3, respectively) along with their energy-minimized average structures.

Structure of the Integrin 3 Transmembrane Segment RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of Bicelle- and Micelle-Embedded 3. The structure of the 3 transmembrane segment embedded in bicelles and micelles, respectively, was determined by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, making use of a 2H/13C/15N labeled peptide encompassing residues P685-F727. At the employed peptide-to-detergent ratio, the 3 peptide is monomeric (35). Likewise, as judged from examining spectral properties such as peak position, line width, and number of peaks as a function of peptide-tobicelle ratio (data not shown), monomeric peptide was obtained within the employed bicelle environment. This is in good agreement with the very weak 3 homo-oligomerization tendency in E. coli cell membranes (36). Moreover, no discernible differences in H-N chemical shifts were detected between bicelle q-factors of 0.2 to 0.3 (data not shown), suggesting that the peptide interacts exclusively with the long-chain lipids of the bicelle. Structure calculations relied on relating backbone internuclear bond vector orientations relative to a common molecular alignment frame (37), with the 3 chemical shift patterns providing additional backbone dihedral angle restraints (30). For the ensemble of 20 calculated simulated annealing structures, coordinate precisions of 0.18 and 0.21 Å were obtained for the backbone-heavy atoms of the structured regions of the bicelle- and micelle-embedded 3 peptide, respectively. The structural statistics are summarized in Supporting Information, Table 1. The structure of bicelle-embedded 3 consists of a linear R-helix extending from I693 to H722 (Figure 1A). N-terminal to D692 on the extracellular side and C-terminal to D723 on the intracellular side, the peptide becomes dynamically unstructured. The inclusion of the entire intracellular tail, terminating at T762, does not affect the transmembrane structure, as judged from the small D692-D723 chemical shift changes encountered when extending the 3 peptide (Supporting Information, Figure 2). For micelle-embedded 3, a highly similar structure was obtained for I693-K716 (Figure 1B and C). Relative to the bicelle-embedded structure, this region exhibits a backbone rmsd of 0.33 Å. However, C-terminal to K716, the first charged residues on the intracellular side, the structures differ markedly. The linear R-helical conformation of the mostly hydrophobic L717-I721 residues found in bicelle-embedded 3 is distorted in the micelle environment, and the helix terminates at I721 instead of H722 (Figure 1C-E). Nevertheless, L717-I721 backbone torsion angles are still within the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot (Supporting Information, Table 1). The distortion results in the bending of the last helix turns away from the helix axis and in a slightly reduced helical rise per residue for L717-I721. An overall shortening of the micelle- compared to the bicelle-embedded TM helix by approximately 0.5 Å along the helix axis results. As a further consequence, the 3 side-chain orientations differ significantly between the two media for residues following K716 (Figure 1D and E). For both bicelle- and micelle-embedded 3, the averaging of side chain 1 rotameric states is common (Supporting Information, Table 2). One interesting difference between the 1 distributions between the two media is found for W715. Its rotameric state is well defined within the bicelle, but not the micelle.

FIGURE 2: Comparison of backbone structural and dynamic parameters for the 3 transmembrane segment in bicelles and micelles. (A) The 3 sary 13CR chemical shifts obtained in the two media are compared. Besides their congruence for I693-K716 and divergence for L717-H722, a small shift difference of 0.5 ppm was observed for residues G690-P691. Although the G690-P691 sary 13CR chemical shifts are already close to random-coil values, i.e., zero, the difference between bicelle- and micelle-embedded 3 suggests that slightly different ensembles of G690-P691 conformers were obtained at the bicelle- and micelle-water interface, respectively. The glycine-proline combination is also interesting for the absence of an extended glycine backbone conformation. For any other amino acid, the succession by proline would have resulted in an extended backbone conformation (48), reflected by a large negative 13CR secondary shift as seen for the preceding S687-P688 pair. 13CR secondary shifts are reported relative to the random coil values of ref 38 but have not been corrected for the approximately +0.5 ppm isotope shift resulting from perdeuteration of the carbon-attached hydrogens. (B) Picoto nanosecond dynamics, correlative to backbone order (39), are compared in the form of heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE values. Regions that exhibit significant 13CR secondary shift differences between bicelle- and micelle-embedded 3 are boxed by blue rectangles.

The close equivalence of the bicelle- and micelle-embedded 3 structure for I693-K716, as well as their divergence for L717-H722, is further illustrated by a comparison of their 13 R C secondary shifts (Figure 2A). Defined as difference between the observed and tabulated random-coil 13CR shift of a residue, secondary 13CR chemical shifts correlate well with the underlying backbone conformation (38), as evidenced here. The high congruence of the 13CR secondary shifts for I693-K716 also indicates that their backbone rmsd of 0.33 Å between bicelle- and micelle-embedded 3 is representative of the accuracy of the obtained structures. To determine whether the 3 structural differences in the two model membrane systems were related to differences in backbone dynamics, {1H}-15N NOE values were compared. This parameter is sensitive to fluctuations of a residue's backbone H-N bond vector on the pico- to nanosecond time scale, which correlates with backbone order (39). Except for a slight variation for S699-V700, this parameter is in close agreement between bicelle- and micelle-

embedded 3 (Figure 2B). Thus, although the R-helical conformation observed for L717-I721 of micelle-embedded 3 is less linear than that found in the bicelle, it is not less ordered. C-terminal to H722, backbone order decreases faster in the micelle than in the bicelle environment. Since the last helix turns of micelle-embedded 3 are distorted, albeit not disordered, helix fraying is probably faster in the micelle compared to the bicelle environment, leading to the faster observed decrease in backbone order. Moreover, for micelleembedded 3, a kink at D723 was reported (11, 40), which would be compatible with the present data. This kink must be a consequence of the micelle environment because H722D723 are in R-helical conformation in the bicelle environment (Figure 1C and D). On the level of primary structure, the 3 TM domain is also similar to the integrin 2, 5, and 6 subunits (Supporting Information, Figure 3). The described 3 structure can, therefore, serve as a structural template for these integrin subunits. Assessment of 3 Bicelle/Micelle Embedding. The protection of individual 3 residues from a paramagnetic relaxation agent and solvent­water, respectively, was assessed to examine the embedding of 3 in the bicelle and micelle, respectively. Specifically, backbone HN resonance-broadening arising from the presence of the relaxation enhancer in the aqueous phase was measured, and the exchange of the backbone HN nucleus with water was quantified. Water forms a concentration gradient throughout the lipid headgroup region that reaches up to the glycerol backbone of lipids (41). A concentration gradient is also present for the employed Mn2+EDDA2- relaxation agent (42), but, whereas HN exchange can be inhibited by intrahelical hydrogen bonding, no such bias exists for the paramagnetic agent. However, the proximity of Mn2+EDDA2- to the backbone HN nuclei may be somewhat modulated by the surrounding side chains, making the comparison of 3 protection between different hydrophobic environments most useful. HN protection from Mn2+EDDA2- is expressed quantitatively as normalized ratio of H-N signal intensities in the presence and absence of the paramagnetic agent, I/I0. The broadening patterns obtained for bicelle- and micelleembedded 3 are analogous (Figure 3A), which means that the same residues are embedded in the hydrophobic bicelle/ micelle core. The steepest rise in I/I0 values is obtained between V695 and V696 on the extracellular side and between L718 and I719 on the intracellular side. The central position between these bounds is I707. This residue coincides with the center of the micelle-embedded 3 helix (I693-I721). For the slightly longer helix in the bicelle environment (I693H722), this indicates that the helix extends farther by one residue on the intra compared to extracellular side. It is also noted that, for both bicelle- and micelle-embedded 3, the rise in I/I0 values on the extracellular side is steeper than that on the intracellular side, where more residues with intermediate I/I0 values are present. This may indicate some degree of heterogeneity in the tail-to-headgroup transition of the 3 TM helix or Mn2+EDDA2- concentration gradient on the intracellular side. The amount of HN-water exchange taking place during a defined time period is quantified as the ratio of H-N signal intensities obtained with and without the selective inversion of solvent magnetization, I/I0. On the intracellular side, the different structures of bicelle- and micelle-embedded 3 give

FIGURE 3: Bicelle and micelle embedding of 3. (A) Signal broadening due to paramagnetic relaxation enhancement arising from the presence of Mn2+EDDA2-. The normalized ratio of H-N TROSY signal intensities in the presence and absence of 1 mM Mn2+EDDA2-, I/I0, is used to quantify signal broadening for each residue. (B) Exchange of the backbone amide protons (HN) with water; depicted as the ratio of H-N TROSY signal intensities obtained with and without selective solvent inversion, I/I0, at pH 8.4 and 25 °C. The solvent was inverted 100 ms prior to the start of the pulse sequence, and radiation damping was suppressed by the application of a weak gradient pulse during this period. An I/I0 value of -1 corresponds to the exchange of a residue's HN nucleus with water in all 3 molecules present, whereas a value of +1 denotes the absence of any exchange. Resonances that were absent at pH 8.4, compared to pH 6.5, were assigned I/I0 values of -1. The water selective pulse (8 ms RE-BURP) is slightly touching the hydroxyl nucleus of S699, which resonates at 4.12 ppm, and an I/I0 dip ensues in the absence of actual exchange. The same applies to T720, but its hydroxyl nucleus is unobservable and therefore must be in direct, fast exchange with water molecules that reach up to the glycerol lipid backbone (41). (C) Structure of the 3 transmembrane helix centered on I707 as a function of the membrane-crossing angle. The experimentally determined average positions of the lipid carbonyl, phosphate, and choline groups (16, 20, and 22 Å from the center of the membrane) are depicted for 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (41), which is closely related to the herein employed 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine. The bulk water phase is assumed to be fully established at 28 Å (46). N-terminal to D692 and C-terminal to D723, the 3 peptide becomes dynamically unstructured, and the depicted conformation for these residues is random.

Structure of the Integrin 3 Transmembrane Segment rise to quite different exchange behaviors (Figure 3B). Much better shielding is observed in the bicelle in agreement with more ideal hydrogen bond geometries (Figure 1C-E) and slower helix fraying (Figure 2B). In the bicelle, complete exchange is observed starting from K725, whereas in the micelle, complete exchange commences at H722. Interestingly, the I/I0 patterns also differ on the extracellular side where structural differences between bicelle- and micelleembedded 3 are negligible. In the micelle system, D692 shows almost complete exchange, whereas for the bicelle, this would be expected for P691 (which does not possess an amide proton). This shift in protection by one residue indicates that water can approach the hydrophobic micelle core more closely than the bicelle interior. Which residues are bordering the micelle and bicelle? On the extracellular side, D692 is the clear candidate. It is the last charged residue before the stretch of (proline-free) hydrophobic residues begins and the first residue to experience rapid HN-water exchange in the micelle environment. The first charged residue on the intracellular side, K716, clearly is still embedded as shown by its significant protection from Mn2+EDDA2- (Figure 3A). Glycosylation mapping studies of the similar integrin 1 subunit in microsomal membranes have suggested the five residues following 1(K752), L-L-M-I-I, to be membrane embedded (10), placing H722 of 3 at the intracellular membrane border. H722 is also the first residue to experience rapid HN-water exchange in the micelle environment, where it is present in nonhelical conformation. In conclusion, the bicelle and micelle embed the same 3 residues. Solvent exchange, glycosylation mapping studies, and a helix center at residue I707 agree in predicting that residues D692 and H722 border the TM helix on the extra and intracellular side, respectively. 3 Helix Tilt. While it is not possible to accurately define the 3 membrane-crossing angle with the data at hand, they nevertheless serve to indicate that the 3 transmembrane domain helix will possess a pronounced tilt within a typical lipid bilayer. Figure 3C depicts the orientation of the 3 TM helix centered on I707 relative to the functional groups of a bilayer composed of lipids with 18/18 carbon atom tails (41) at three tilt angles. It is evident that a pronounced helix tilt relative to the membrane is required to accommodate the mostly hydrophobic 29-residue TM helix (I693-I721) of approximately 43.5 Å length beyond the charged groups of the lipid molecules. A tilt angle in the range of 20­30° appears likely. A pronounced helix tilt facilitates the snorkeling of K716 by bringing its side chain closer to the headgroup region (Figure 3C) where it can engage a counterion such as a lipid's phosphate group. Similarly, W715's side chain is expected close to the lipids' -CO-O-CHR2-CH2- spacer between the headgroup and hydrocarbon tails. Besides tryptophan's general preference for this localization (43), the latter statement is supported by its well-defined 1 rotamer in the bicelle but not micelle, whose constituent DPC molecules lack the -CO-O-CHR2-CH2- spacer. A pronounced helix tilt, therefore, will aid in balancing the opposing immersion tendencies of W715-K716 and L717-I721. While the same residues are embedded in the micelle than in the bicelle (Figure 3A), the divergence in structures following K716 indicates that a limited plasticity of the micelle constrains the structure of the 3 TM segment on the intracellular side. Specifically, the change in micelle

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 13, 2008 4013 curvature and symmetry imposed by a fully linear R-helical 3 TM structure is apparently not sustainable, leading to L717-I721 deformations (Figure 1C and E). Within the bicelle, the helix tilt places linear R-helical structure for W715-H722 in a nonsymmetrical environment, that is, W715, K716, and I719 are closer to the lipid headgroups, and L717, L718, and I721 are closer to the hydrocarbon tails than they would be at a zero tilt angle (Figures 3C and 1D). This allows K716 to be separated from the membrane border by five residues (L717-I721). When transferring this topography to the micelle environment, a nonzero tilt angle is equivalent to an asymmetric distribution of detergent molecules around the 3 TM helix. The reduction of the overall TM helix length and bending of L717-I721 away from the helix axis toward K716's side chain (Figure 1C and E) may, therefore, have contributions from the lack of a sufficiently asymmetric detergent distribution in addition to curvature strain. It is also interesting to note that micelle curvature and symmetry strains as well as 3 TM helix deformations are not reduced by simply partitioning L717-I721 into the aqueous phase. Apparently, this option is energetically least desirable. Influence of Lipid Headgroup on 3 Structure. Bicelles possess a symmetrical lipid distribution, which is in contrast to the asymmetric nature of biological membranes. To evaluate the impact of this simplification and to examine the influence of the lipid headgroup type on the 3 TM structure, backbone chemical shifts between different bicelle lipid configurations were compared. In this respect, the backbone 15 N chemical shift of a residue is useful since it depends on the underlying backbone and side chain conformations as well as the chemical environment of the amino acid and its surroundings (44). To better judge the magnitude of the obtained 15N shift changes upon varying the bicelle lipid headgroup, we first compared the 15N shift differences detected between the bicelle and micelle environment. Large shift changes of up to 2.08 ppm were observed at both helix termini (Figure 4A). On the extracellular side, where 3 structural differences are minimal (Figure 1C), the shift changes reflect changes in the underlying chemical environment. The intracellular side, where 3 structural changes are also significant (Figure 1C), accordingly experiences more widespread 15N shift changes. Much smaller 15N shift changes were observed between bicelles of different lipid compositions (Figure 4B and C). The introduction of the negatively charged POPG lipid (1palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]), which is common to plant and prokaryotic cell membranes, was tested in addition to POPS (1-palmitoyl2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-L-serine]), representing the dominant negatively charged lipid in platelets (45). The substitution of one-third of bicellar POPC lipids with POPG lead to significant 15N shift changes only at the C-terminal end of the 3 TM helix (Figure 4B). But even there, the magnitude of the observed shift differences of up to 0.39 ppm is relatively small. The 3 backbone structures in the two bicelle configurations are indistinguishable, as evidenced by the congruence of their 13CR secondary shifts (Supporting Information, Figure 4F). Differences in chemical environments, most notably the negative charge of the POPG headgroup and ensuing presence of an external counterion for PO4- (46), are therefore expected to make the largest

contribution to the 15N shift differences. When substituting POPG for POPS, almost no shift differences were observed (Figure 4C); the maximum deviation of 0.08 ppm is close to the noise. The two bicelle configurations both lead to equivalent 3 structures and provide a highly similar chemical environment for 3. For the sake of completeness, it is noted that backbone 1HN shift changes closely follow the detected 15N shift changes (Supporting Information, Figure 4). In sum, the type of headgroup of the glycerophospholipids had a slight impact on the structure of 3 on the intracellular side, but essentially none on the extracellular face. The headgroups can, therefore, be chosen to suit the intracellular 3 side, suggesting that an asymmetric lipid distribution is not required for studying the 3 TM segment. Implications for Integrin ActiVation. Separation of integrin R- subunit TM helices has been proposed as a mechanism for transmitting signals across the bilayer (2, 4­7). On the basis of this idea, it would follow that the structure and topology of the monomeric 3 TM helix reported here represent an activated form. In addition, changes in TM helix

topology have also been proposed to accompany integrin activation (9). TM helix repartitioning is conceivable for the subunit. For integrin 3, this would mean R and/or transferring L717-I721 out of the hydrophobic bilayer core into the aqueous phase. To investigate the propensity of 3(K716-I721) to partition into the aqueous phase, the tails of the bicelle lipids were shortened from 16/18 to 14/14 carbon atoms. This led to even smaller 15N chemical shift changes than obtained when altering the lipid headgroups (Figure 5A vs Figure 4B). Consistent with these small shift changes, protection from the paramagnetic relaxation agent Mn2+EDDA2- was similar between the bicelles of different lipid tail length (Figure 5B), clearly demonstrating the absence of 3 repartitioning. Thus, monomeric 3 prefers to immerse residues I693-I721 into the hydrophobic cores of all model membrane systems studied here. The transfer of K716's charged side chain out of the hydrophobic membrane core and the simultaneous immersion of L717-I721 are accomplished by adopting a substantial 3 TM helix tilt relative to the membrane (Figure 3C). The role of the L717-I721 hydrophobic stretch following K716 may, therefore, be to ensure a high propensity for a pronounced 3 TM helix tilt relative to a typical membrane bilayer. The helix tilt angle can specify R- TM helix packing and thereby control the extent of bidirectional transmembrane signaling. Changes in membrane thickness could also affect integrin signaling by modulating TM helix tilt angles. A substantial increase in lipid tail length could also decrease the tilt angle to a point where K716 snorkeling is not sustainable and,

Structure of the Integrin 3 Transmembrane Segment hence, force L717-I721 repartitioning. On the intracellular side, the 3 TM helix continues into the headgroup region in R-helical conformation before fraying. In the presence of the full-length 3 cytosolic tail, helix propensity continues well into the cytosol (11, 40, 47) and the activating talin F3 domain stabilizes helical structure in this membrane-proximal region (17). In contrast to the intracellular side, the transition between the 3 TM and extracellular domain is rather abrupt. Preceding D692, the first residue in nonhelical conformation, residues P688-K689-G690-P691 do not show defined structural propensities (Figure 2). While the presence of the 3 extracellular domain may stabilize a particular conformation for P688-P691, the conspicuous abundance of proline and glycine residues is expected to impede the formation of welldefined secondary structure. Thus, the connection between the 3 TM helix and the extracellular domain appears quite different from its connection to the cytoplasmic domain.
