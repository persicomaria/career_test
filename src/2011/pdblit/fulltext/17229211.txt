Summary Successful pathogenic organisms have developed mechanisms to thrive under extreme levels of iron restriction. Haem-iron represents the largest iron reservoir in the human body and is a significant source of iron for some bacterial pathogens. NEAT (NEAr Transporter) domains are found exclusively in a family of cell surface proteins in Gram-positive bacteria. Many NEAT domain-containing proteins, including IsdA in Staphylococcus aureus, are implicated in haem binding. Here, we show that overexpression of IsdA in S. aureus enhances growth and an inactivation mutant of IsdA has a growth defect, compared with wild type, when grown in media containing haem as the sole iron source. Furthermore, the haem-binding property of IsdA is contained within the NEAT domain. Crystal structures of the apo-IsdA NEAT domain and in complex with haem were solved and reveal a clathrin adapter-like b-sandwich fold with a large hydrophobic haem-binding pocket. Haem is bound with the propionate groups directed at the molecular surface and the iron is co-ordinated solely by Tyr166. The phenol groups of Tyr166 and Tyr170 form an H-bond that may function in regulating haem binding and release. An analysis of IsdA structure-sequence alignments indicate that conservation of Tyr166 is a predictor of haem binding by NEAT domains. mechanisms to limit bacterial growth (Ratledge and Dover, 2000). To combat host iron restriction, bacterial pathogens have evolved multiple acquisition systems to obtain iron directly from host sources (Wandersman and Delepelaire, 2004). Haem is the most prevalent form of iron in the human body, representing nearly 75% of the total iron (Stojiljkovic and Perkins-Balding, 2002). Not surprisingly, haem uptake systems are identified as major virulence or colonization factors in bacterial infections (Stojiljkovic et al., 1995; Murphy et al., 2002; Ahn et al., 2005). A recent study eloquently demonstrated that haem is the preferred iron source in the early stages of growth by the versatile pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus (Skaar et al., 2004). In comparison with Gram-negative bacteria, the molecular basis of iron and in particular haem uptake in Grampositive bacteria remains poorly understood. Recently, the Isd (Iron-regulated surface determinant) system was identified as a primary haem acquisition pathway in S. aureus (Mazmanian et al., 2002; 2003). Four cell wall-anchored proteins, IsdA, IsdB, IsdC and IsdH (or HarA), are proposed to act as receptors for haem or haem proteins (Dryla et al., 2003; Skaar and Schneewind, 2004). IsdB, which is anchored to the peptidoglycan by the action of sortase A, is exposed on the staphylococcal cell surface (Mazmanian et al., 2003); it is highly immunogenic in mice, and anti-IsdB antibodies cross-react with IsdH/ HarA (Kuklin et al., 2006). IsdB and IsdH/HarA bind haemoglobin and the haemoglobin­haptoglobin complex respectively (Dryla et al., 2003; Mazmanian et al., 2003). IsdC, which is anchored to the peptidoglycan by the action of sortase B, is not exposed on the cell surface and therefore likely buried within the thick peptidoglycan structure (Mazmanian et al., 2003). IsdC has been demonstrated to bind free haem (Mazmanian et al., 2003; Mack et al., 2004). IsdA, a sortase A substrate, is expressed highly on the cell surface during iron-limited growth (Taylor and Heinrichs, 2002; Mazmanian et al., 2003) and has been demonstrated to bind haem (Mazmanian et al., 2003; Vermeiren et al., 2006). In comparison with wild-type S. aureus cells, less haem associates with both whole cells and protoplasts in an isdA null mutant (Mazmanian et al., 2003). In addition to haem binding, other proposed roles for IsdA are in transferrin binding (Taylor and Heinrichs, 2002) and as a broad spectrum adhesin (Clarke et al., 2004). Given that it is at least partly exposed on the bacterial cell surface (Mazmanian et al., 2003), IsdA is the target of a

Fig. 1. Peroxidase activity in S. aureus cell wall extracts. Cell wall proteins from S. aureus Newman (lanes 1 and 2), S. aureus Newman isdA mutant (lanes 3 and 4) and S. aureus Newman isdA mutant complemented with pJT35 (lanes 5 and 6) were incubated with (lanes 2, 4, 6) or without haem (lanes 1, 3, 5) prior to electrophoresis. Gels were then stained with coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (A) or 3,3,5,5-tetramethyl benzidine (TMBZ) (B). The TMBZ-stained bands indicate the presence of haem-dependent peroxidase activity.

significant titre of IgG antibodies in infected humans and a rat nasal carriage model showed that IsdA has promise as a vaccine candidate (Clarke et al., 2006). The amino acid sequences of IsdA, IsdB, IsdC and IsdH/HarA contain conserved NEAT domains. These domains are approximately 125 amino acids in length and are named because of the chromosomal location NEAr iron Transport protein-encoding genes (Andrade et al., 2002). Searches of sequence databases reveal that they occur in anywhere from one to five copies in proteins terminated with cell wall anchoring motifs from Grampositive bacteria such as S. aureus, Bacillus anthracis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium tetani, among others (for a review of cell wall anchoring motifs, see Marraffini et al., 2006). The presence of NEAT domains in several haem-binding proteins, including members of the Isd system, suggests that this domain may play a key role in haem binding and transport. However, the high diversity in the amino acid sequences of NEAT domains has precluded the definition of a sequence motif required for haem binding. In this study, we show that overexpression of IsdA does indeed enhance the growth of S. aureus and mutants lacking isdA demonstrate a growth defect in media containing haem as a sole source of iron. We further show that, when expressed in Escherichia coli, both full-length IsdA and the isolated NEAT domain are capable of binding haem. To elucidate the basis of haem binding by the IsdA NEAT domain, the domain was crystallized. Crystal structures of the IsdA NEAT domain and of a haem complex reveal a ligand binding cleft and allow the identification of conserved amino acid residues that make specific interactions with bound haem. Results Acquisition of haem-iron by S. aureus is enhanced by IsdA Previously, IsdA has been shown to bind haem

(Mazmanian et al., 2003; Vermeiren et al., 2006) and Vermeiren et al. (2006) demonstrated that one molecule of IsdA binds one haem molecule. However, to date, the role of IsdA in haem-iron acquisition by S. aureus is poorly understood. To assess the affect of isdA on the biology of S. aureus with respect to the ability of this bacterium to utilize haem as a sole source of iron, the isdA gene was insertionally inactivated with a tetracycline resistance cassette in the chromosome of S. aureus Newman to create strain H734. When cell wall protein fractions were taken from S. aureus cultures and stained for peroxidase activity to identify haem proteins, wild-type cells (strain Newman) incubated with haem show clear staining of a band corresponding to IsdA that is not present in H734 (isdA­) cells (Fig. 1). This band is restored in H734 containing plasmid pJT35 which expresses a cloned isdA gene (Fig. 1). Two different bioassays were performed to assess the significance of IsdA in the acquisition of haem as a source of iron. In a plate assay, there was no observable growth defect in H734 relative to Newman (Fig. 2A). Notably, however, H734 expressing isdA from plasmid pJT35 showed a 40% growth enhancement on haem as a sole source of iron. In an alternative liquid culture assay, we demonstrated that while there was no difference in growth rate or yield between strain Newman and strain H734 (Newman isdA::tet) in iron-replete or iron-restricted chemically defined media (TMS), there was a significant difference in the growth rate and yield between the two strains when haem was provided as a sole source of iron (Fig. 2B). This effect is due to the specific lack of isdA expression in the H734 strain because introduction of pJT35 (which contains only isdA) into H734 complemented the growth defect (Fig. 2B).

Partial haem occupancy is typical for haem transport proteins expressed intracellularly in E. coli (Mack et al., 2004; Eakanunkul et al., 2005; Schneider et al., 2006). To ensure sample homogeneity for protein crystallization, apo and holo protein were separated by anion exchange chromatography. The apo protein was then crystallized as purified and after reconstitution with haem. Reconstituted IsdA resembles the holo protein fraction as purified from E. coli, except for a greater ratio of the haem Soret (A407) to A280 absorption (data not shown), indicating greater substrate saturation. The IsdA NEAT domain structure reveals haem-iron co-ordination by a conserved tyrosine The IsdA NEAT domain apo structure was solved to 1.6 Å resolution by seleno-methionine labelling and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing (Hendrickson, 1991), whereas the IsdA NEAT holo structure was solved to 1.9 Å resolution by molecular replacement. The IsdA NEAT domain forms an Ig-like fold composed of seven b-stands forming two sheets of a b-sandwich. However, an additional eighth b-strand is present which results in the N- and C-termini being located in close proximity (Fig. 3). The recently described fold of the IsdH/HarA NEAT domain 1 (19% sequence identity to the IsdA NEAT domain) is similar except for residues forming an additional N-terminal strand on one b-sheet such that the N and C-termini are on opposite ends of the molecule (Pilpa et al., 2006). Although no significant sequence similarity is

Plate bioassays were used to measure growth on haemin as a sole source of iron for S. aureus Newman, H734 (isdA::tet) and H734 containing a multicopy plasmid-expressing isdA. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant change in growth promotion compared with Newman or H734 (P < 0.001 as determined by Student's t-test). Solid horizontal line denotes the diameter of the paper disk that contained the haemin. B. Liquid culture assays were used to compare the growth of S. aureus strains Newman (squares), H734 (circles) and H734 containing pJT35 (triangles) in TMS media containing 10 mM EDDHA with 50 mM FeCl3 (grey fill), 5 mg ml-1 haemin (black fill) or no further additions (no fill).

Therefore, we expressed only the IsdA NEAT domain in E. coli and found that, indeed, it alone was capable of binding haem as judged by UV-visible spectroscopy at 280 and 407 nm (data not shown). An absorbance ratio of 280 nm to 407 nm indicated that the NEAT domain, as expressed from E. coli, was approxi-

present, a Dali search (Holm and Sander, 1993) reveals that the IsdA NEAT domain fold is similar to that of the clathrin adapter appendage superfamily (2.9 Å r.m.s.d. for 94 aligned Ca atoms to PDB entry 1GYU). The NEAT domain fold is unique with respect to haem-binding proteins. The NEAT domain b-sandwich is splayed open at the end opposite the chain termini, forming a pocket between one of the b-sheets and a loop formed from residues Ser82 to Tyr87 (Fig. 4A). Haem binding in this pocket does not cause significant displacement of the backbone (0.53 Å r.m.s.d.) or side-chain atoms of most residues in the IsdA NEAT domain (Fig. 4C). Only His83 and Met84 appear to undergo significant conformational changes (Fig. 4D). The side-chain of His83 rotates ~135° about c1 to vacate

the pocket and form a hydrogen bond to one of the haem propionates. Met84 also shifts to accommodate the haem by moving deeper into the binding pocket (SD displacement of ~4.7 Å). The haem group is bound in the hydrophobic pocket in two equally occupied orientations related to one another by a 180° rotation about the a,g-meso axis. In both orientations the propionate groups overlap and are facing out towards the solvent. Approximately 278 Å2 (~35%) of haem surface area is exposed to solvent (as determined with AREAIMOL; Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). The propionates form hydrogen bonds with residues Lys75 (2.86 Å), Ser82 (2.62 Å) and His83 (2.87 Å) (Figs 4A and 5).

meiren et al., 2006), the crystal structure of the NEAT domain­haem complex reveals that the iron is five-coordinate, with the axial ligand (2.11 Å) provided by the phenolic oxygen of conserved Tyr166 (Fig. 4A and 5). The iron atom is displaced from the haem nitrogen plane towards the co-ordinating oxygen by 0.35 Å and the angle between the phenol ring and the ligand bond is ~130°. Tyr166, in turn, forms a hydrogen bond (2.55 Å) to Tyr170 OH (Fig. 5). His83 is positioned on the opposite side of the tetrapyrrole plane to Tyr170; however, the imidazole ring is coplanar to the haem and does not serve as a second axial ligand. Several hydrophobic residues that comprise the binding pocket, namely Met84, Tyr87, Phe112, Trp113, Val157, Ile159, Val161 and Tyr170, contact the tetrapyrrole rings of the haem. IsdA point mutants show that Tyr166 and Tyr170 are essential for haem binding Spectroscopic studies of full-length (excluding signal peptide and C-terminal sorting sequences) IsdA reveal a strong absorbance at 407 nm (A407/A280 ratio = 0.629), as well as signals in the visible region at 503 nm, 538 nm and 625 nm, indicative of haem binding (Fig. 6). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of GST­IsdA was performed to monitor the significance of IsdA residues for haem binding (Fig. 6). Mutation of the conserved haem-iron co-ordinating residue, Tyr166, to alanine resulted in almost complete abolition of absorption at 407 nm (A407/A280 ratio = 0.20) indicating that this residue is essential for haem binding. Mutation of Tyr170 to Ala (A407/A280 ratio = 0.23) also significantly affects haem binding while mutation of Tyr87 to Ala (A407/A280 ratio = 0.40) diminishes, but does not abolish, haem binding. These latter two residues are situated in the haem-binding pocket and provide hydrophobic interactions in addition to the H-bond between Tyr170 and Tyr166. That His83 is not involved in co-ordinating haemiron is aptly demonstrated by the result that a His83 to Ala mutation does not at all diminish haem binding (A407/A280

ratio = 0.68). As magnetic circular dichroism of IsdA identified a tyrosyl residue as the axial ligand (Vermeiren et al., 2006), alanine substitution of all remaining NEAT domain tyrosines (Tyr101, Tyr102 and Tyr150) was performed. None of these tyrosines are found within the haembinding pocket in the crystal structure and none of these substitutions affected the absorbance spectra of IsdA compared with wild-type protein. NEAT domain sequence-structure alignments reveal that the tyrosine ligand is a prognosticator of haem binding Recognition of haem is by a deep, largely hydrophobic pocket formed by a single IsdA NEAT domain. A multiple sequence alignment of a representative set of 43 NEAT domains is given in Fig. S1 and the seven NEAT domains found in S. aureus (one in IsdA, two in IsdB, one in IsdC and three in IsdH/HarA) are presented in Fig. 7. Three residues in IsdA that make key haem interactions, Ser82, Tyr166 and Tyr170, are generally conserved in a large

Fig. 7. Multiple sequence alignment of NEAT domains from S. aureus. The alignment was extracted from an alignment of NEAT domains from several Gram-positive organisms (Fig. S1). In the designation for each of the domains, the number before the dash identifies the NEAT domain number in order from the N-terminus of the protein, and the number after the dash indicates the total number of NEAT domains present in the protein. Positions shaded in dark grey and light grey are identical or similar, respectively, in at least 85% of the aligned S. aureus sequences. Residues identified by asterisk are those that contribute contacts to the haem group. The primary accession numbers are as follows: SauIsdA (Q7A655), SauIsdB (Q7A656), SauIsdC (Q7A654), SauHarA (Q99TD3). The figure was generated in BioEdit (Hall, 1999).

number of NEAT domains (Fig. S1) but are present in only four out of the seven S. aureus NEAT domains (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the residues that form the hydrophobic haem-binding pocket in IsdA are either conserved or replaced with similar hydrophobic amino acids in most NEAT domains. In S. aureus NEAT domains with a Tyr residues aligned at positions 166 and 170, haem pocket residues at positions 157, 159 and 161 are either valine or isoleucine and residue 87 is either tyrosine or phenylalanine (Fig. 7). Pilpa et al. (2006) identified conserved tyrosine and histidine residues (potential haem-iron ligands) in S. aureus NEAT domains known to bind haem that were absent in those NEAT domains shown not to bind haem, such as the N-terminal NEAT domain in IsdH/ HarA. Thus, Tyr52, Tyr132, His134 and Tyr136 in IsdC, which correspond to Tyr87, Tyr166, His168 and Tyr170 in IsdA, were speculated to be potential haem-iron ligands (Pilpa et al., 2006). Now, based on a distinct pattern of conservation of amino acid residues observed to interact with the haem in the IsdA structure, we predict that the single NEAT domain of IsdC, and the C-terminal NEAT domains of IsdB and IsdH/HarA bind haem and co-ordinate the haem-iron by the residue analogous to Tyr166 in IsdA. The other

S. aureus NEAT domains either do not bind haem, or bind haem in a completely different manner. Discussion Haem binding and uptake are effective means for pathogens to acquire growth limiting iron from their host and indeed overexpression of IsdA does enhance growth (Fig. 2A) and growth in liquid culture of H734 (isdA­) is reduced significantly when haem is provided as a sole iron source (Fig. 2B). In contrast, plate bioassays suggest that redundancy exists either within the cell surface Isd system or with other haem transport systems such as Hts (Skaar et al., 2004) which are able to compensate for the loss of isdA, at least in vitro. The plate bioassay showing that overexpression of IsdA in S. aureus enhances haemiron acquisition suggests that IsdA may function as a cell surface reservoir for haem. It should be noted, however, that although haemin is used commonly in in vitro bioassays to probe the involvement of haem-iron transport proteins, S. aureus would rarely, if ever, encounter free haem within the host. More likely, IsdA would encounter haem complexed to proteins such as haemopexin and, in

Haem recognition by a Staphylococcus aureus NEAT domain 145 that context, IsdA may be an essential component of the haem-iron acquisition pathway. The surface potential of the IsdA NEAT domain reveals two large electropositive regions, one located near the polypeptide chain termini, and the other on the same face of the molecule, behind the haem-binding pocket (Fig. 4B). Alignments reveal several conserved residues, Lys75, Lys100, Arg140, Lys156 and His158 (see Fig. S1), contributing to these positively charged regions (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, haemopexin, a proposed IsdA substrate (Skaar and Schneewind, 2004), has two dominant negatively charged surfaces near the tunnel entrance of each b-propeller domain (Paoli et al., 1999). The location of the complementary charge surfaces on haemopexin and IsdA, should such an interaction occur, suggests that host protein binding and haem transfer may require more than one IsdA molecule. Non-specific, electrostatic interactions may help to explain the ability of IsdA to interact with several different host proteins (Clarke et al., 2004). Alternatively, the positive surfaces on the IsdA NEAT domain may assist in the orientation of the protein with respect to the negatively charged cell wall or provide an interaction surface for other components of the Isd haem uptake system that convey the haem to the membrane transport complex. In contrast, analysis of the solution structure of the IsdH/HarA N-terminal NEAT domain reveals a large surface with a negative potential (Pilpa et al., 2006). This surface is suggested to be involved in the binding of haemoglobin by IsdH/HarA in a 2:1 stoichiometry (Pilpa et al., 2006). Haem-iron bound by a single axial tyrosine ligand is uncommon in haem proteins but is an emerging characteristic of haem transporters, including serum albumin, ShuT from Shigella dysenteriae and ChaN from Campylobacter jejuni (Zunszain et al., 2003; Eakanunkul et al., 2005; Chan et al., 2006). The binding of haem to the haemophore from Serratia marcescens, HasA, and the haem chaperone, CcmE, involved in cytochrome c maturation are also similar to IsdA; however, in these instances, an additional histidine residue is co-ordinated to the iron (Arnoux et al., 1999; Uchida et al., 2004). Similar to the IsdA NEAT domain, the multifunctional catalases co-ordinate haem by a single tyrosine. Moreover, and also like the IsdA NEAT domain, a histidine is present on the opposite side of haem in catalase, but does not co-ordinate to the iron (Putnam et al., 2000). No catalase activity could be detected for the IsdA NEAT domain and this is likely because His83 blocks the sixth co-ordination position of the haem iron (Fig. 5). That His83 is not a ligand to haem-iron in the IsdA crystal structure, as observed in HasA and CcmE, is further supported by the fact that haem binding is not diminished in the His83 to Ala mutant (Fig. 6). In fact, the observed slight increase in haem loading of the mutant relative to wildtype IsdA might be explained by a less constricted haembinding pocket in the mutant protein. Moreover, histidine is not found aligned at position 83 in any other NEAT domain from S. aureus, nor is this position conserved among NEAT domains in general (Fig. S1 and Fig. 7). In contrast, Tyr170 is generally conserved in NEAT domain sequences. Tyr170 may play a similar role to His83 in HasA, where it forms a hydrogen bond to the haem-iron co-ordinating Tyr75 (Arnoux et al., 1999). In HasA, protonation of His83 is proposed to alter the affinity of Tyr75 for haem (Arnoux et al., 1999). Similarly, the hydrogen bond observed between Tyr170 and Tyr166 in the IsdA NEAT domain crystal structure may control haem affinity by altering the pKa of the pheonolate iron ligand. Indeed, the Tyr170 to Ala IsdA mutant protein exhibited reduced haem loading as isolated from E. coli (Fig. 6). In general, bound haem is more solvent exposed in haem transport proteins than is typical of non-transport haem proteins. For haem bound to IsdA, 35% of the surface area is exposed to the solvent. The solvent exposure of haem atoms observed in the structures of HasA (Arnoux et al., 1999), ChaN (Chan et al., 2006), HemS (Schneider et al., 2006) and haemopexin (Paoli et al., 1999) ranges from 18% to 26%. In contrast, the exposure to solvent of haem cofactors of enzymes such as myoglobin and cytochrome c is typically less than 15%. Exposure to a high dielectric solvent such as water is correlated with a lowering of the reduction potential of haem (Mauk and Moore, 1997) and the reduction potential of HasA is unusually low (-550 mv) (Izadi et al., 1997). Therefore, high solvent exposure of the haem group in haem transport proteins likely aids in stabilization of the ferric (Fe3+) state of haem iron. The ferric oxidation state of haem is less reactive with oxygen and may facilitate release of the haem group. That the N-terminal NEAT domain in IsdH/HarA does not bind haem (Pilpa et al., 2006) is supported by the striking differences observed between what is the haembinding pocket in IsdA NEAT structure and the equivalent region in the IsdH/HarA N-terminal NEAT domain solution structure. Structural alignment of the IsdA and IsdH/HarA NEAT domain structures reveals that Tyr166, which co-ordinates to haem-iron in IsdA, is replaced by Glu in IsdH/HarA. Tyr170 is conserved; however, conformational differences in the main chain result in directing the phenol group into the haem pocket in the location of the pyrrole ring observed in the IsdA crystal structure. In the solution structure of the IsdH/HarA NEAT domain, the loop between b-strand 1b and b2 (residues Gln124 to Ser130) is disordered (Pilpa et al., 2006). The corresponding region of IsdA, consisting of residues Lys81 to Tyr87, is highly ordered in all six molecules in the asymmetric units of the apo and holo structures (B-factors < 20 Å2). This loop in IsdA interacts directly with the haem propionates

Residues 81­87 are not involved in crystal contact and this loop is also anchored to the hydrophic core in both the apo and holo structures by residue Met84. Thus, for haem to bind to IsdH/HarA N-terminal NEAT domain analogous to that observed for IsdA would require substantial conformational rearrangement. Significantly, no large-scale conformational change is observed between the apo and holo IsdA NEAT domain structures (Fig. 4C). IsdA NEAT domain residues Tyr166 and Tyr170 are critical for haem-iron co-ordination and these residues are conserved in IsdC and in the C-terminal NEAT domains of IsdB and IsdH/HarA. Therefore, we anticipate that each of the four cell wall-anchored S. aureus Isd proteins has at least one NEAT domain that binds haem. The sequence variation among Isd NEAT domains, including positions associated with haem binding, may serve to differentiate these proteins with respect to the recognition of unique haem proteins and non-haem proteins. Given the differences in the `haem pocket' in the N-terminal IsdH/HarA NEAT domain and the IsdA NEAT domain, coupled with observed differences in binding substrates, additional NEAT domain structures and co-crystal structures will undoubtedly shed more light upon the biological role that the individual domains play and will initiate more detailed studies on the working hypothesis that these domains are involved in transfer of haem across the envelope of Grampositive bacteria.

The remaining cell wall fraction was divided into two samples and either haemin (Sigma), dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH, to a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml-1, or the equivalent volume of 0.1 N NaOH was added to each sample. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Cell wall fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with either coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma) or 3,35,5-tetramethylbenzidine as previously described (Stugard et al., 1989).

Staphylococcus aureus Newman strains, cultured overnight in TMS broth, were diluted into TMS broth containing 200 mM 2,2 dipyridyl and grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.3­0.5. Cells were washed three times in sterile saline and added to cooled TMS agar containing EDDHA to a final concentration of 105 colony-forming units (cfu) ml-1. Equal volumes of the agar were poured into sterile Petri plates. Sterile paper discs saturated with haemin (10 mg) were placed on the agar plates and incubated for 72 h at 37°C at which point the diameter of growth around the paper discs was recorded.

Bacterial growth curves
Staphylococcus aureus cultures were pre-grown, from a single colony, overnight in TSB. The cells were washed with saline, and 107 cfu of each strain was inoculated into TMS medium containing 10 mM EDDHA with or without either 50 mM FeCl3 or 5 mg ml-1 haemin. Cultures (300 ml) were incubated at 37°C with continuous shaking and bacterial growth was monitored every 30 min over 20 h using a Bioscreen C (MTX Laboratory Systems). Growth curves were plotted using Sigma Plot 2000.

Experimental procedures Staphylococcus aureus strains and growth conditions
Staphylococcus aureus RN6390 carrying an insertionally inactivated isdA gene has been described previously (Taylor and Heinrichs, 2002). This strain was used to generate the S. aureus Newman strain H734 via transduction using phage 80a (Sebulsky et al., 2000). Similarly, the multicopy plasmidencoding isdA (Taylor and Heinrichs, 2002), pJT35, was transduced into H734. S. aureus strains were routinely cultured at 37°C in tryptic soy broth (Difco). Tris-minimal succinate medium (TMS) was used for iron-restricted growth, prepared as previously described (Sebulsky et al., 2000). Residual free iron was chelated from TMS medium using either 2,2 dipyridyl (200 mM) or ethylenediamine-di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (EDDHA) 10 mM. When appropriate, the antibiotics tetracycline (4 mg ml-1) and chloramphenicol (5 mg ml-1) were included in the growth media.

Recombinant protein expression
The IsdA NEAT domain-coding region (residues 62­184) was cloned into pET28a (Novagen). The domain was expressed in E. coli BL21 grown in 2¥ YT media (Difco) supplemented with 25 mg ml-1 kanamycin. Cultures were grown at 30°C to an OD of 0.8. Isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (0.5 mM) was added and cells were incubated for 16 h at 25°C. The His-6-tagged domain was purified using a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow Ni2+ column (GE Healthcare) and dialysed against 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. The His-6-tag was removed by thrombin digestion. Apo protein was isolated using a Source S column (GE Healthcare) and dialysed against 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Holo protein was generated as previously described, using 20 mM Tris, pH 8 as Buffer A (Chan et al., 2006). Seleno-methionine-labelled protein was expressed as described previously (Van Duyne et al., 1993) and purified as above. The portion of the isdA gene corresponding to amino acids 48­316 (omitting codons for the signal peptide and the cell wall anchoring motifs) was cloned into the GST fusion vector pGEX-2T TEV (Amersham Biosciences). GST­IsdA was expressed from E. coli ER2566 grown in Luria­Bertani broth

Peroxidase staining
Staphylococcus aureus cell wall extracts were prepared as previously described (Cheung and Fischetti, 1988). Briefly, cells were grown overnight in TMS broth containing 2,2 dipyridyl. Cells were washed with 0.9% saline and incubated

(Difco) supplemented with 100 mg ml-1 ampicillin at 37°C to an OD of 0.8. IPTG (0.4 mM) was added and cultures were grown for 20 h at room temperature. GST­IsdA was purified using a GSTPrep column (Amersham Biosciences). GST­ IsdA was eluted from the column with 10 mM reduced glutathione, 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9.0 and dialysed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

IsdA NEAT domain structure determination
Crystals were grown at 19°C by hanging drop vapour diffusion. Drops contained 1 ml of 25 mg ml-1 protein and 1 ml of reservoir solution. The apo protein reservoir contained 0.1 M CHES, pH 9.5, 30% PEG 4000. Crystals were transferred to mother liquor supplemented to 15% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The reservoir for holo protein contained 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 M ammonium sulphate, 30% PEG 6000. Crystals were transferred into mother liquor supplemented to 20% glycerol and immersed in liquid nitrogen. Haem content of holo crystals was examined by dissolving crystals in water and analysing them by electronic spectroscopy using a Varian Cary Bio50 UV spectrophotometer and an 80 ml quartz cuvettes with a 1 cm path length (Fig. S2). X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Menlo Park, CA) at 100 K on beamline 1­5. Multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected for SeMet-labelled apo protein at the selenium peak (0.97879 Å) and inflection (0.97927 Å) wavelengths. Holo IsdA NEAT domain data sets were collected at a wavelength of 0.97944 Å. Data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Apo and holo IsdA NEAT domain crystals are not isomorphous and had two and four molecules in the asymmetric unit respectively. Initial phases and a preliminary model of the apo structure were determined using Solve (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999) and Resolve (Terwilliger, 2000; 2003). Manual construction of the molecule was performed using the program O (Jones et al., 1991) and refined with Refmac5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational

Project, 1994). Molecular replacement with the apo form as a search model was used to solve the holo structure using the program MOLREP from CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) and refined as above. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. For the apo structure, chain A was used for figures and structural comparisons as chain B contained a CHES buffer molecule bound in the haem pocket altering the conformation of neighbouring residues. Chain A from the holo structure was used for figures and analysis as chains C and D form a crystal contact at their respective haem-binding pockets. Chain A and B molecular contacts are removed from the haem binding site (see Figs S3 and S4). Figures were generated in PYMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA).

Haem binding by native and mutant forms of IsdA
Site-directed mutagenesis of isdA was performed using the QuikChange® PCR Kit (Invitrogen), with Pfu Turbo® polymerase and pGST­IsdA as a template. The PCR products were immediately DpnI (Roche) treated for 45 min to degrade template DNA, and transformed into E. coli ER2566. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing at the Robarts Research Institute DNA Sequencing Facility (London, Ontario). GST­IsdA proteins were purified as described above. Wildtype and point mutant proteins were purified as expressed from E. coli and relative haem binding was assessed based on the ability of the proteins, all expressed in an equivalent fashion, to scavenge and retain association with haem derived from the cytoplasm of E. coli. Proteins were adjusted to an equivalent concentration and electronic spectra were recorded using a Cary 500 spectrophotometer (Varian) with a 1 cm path length and 1 ml quartz cuvettes. All recordings were taken at room temperature.
