Institute of Molecular Biology Academia Sinica, Taipei Taiwan, 11529, Republic of China Glutathione S-transferase cGSTM1-1, an avian class-mu enzyme with high sequence identity with rGSTM3-3, was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. The three-dimensional structure of this protein that cocrystallized with an inhibitor, S-hexylglutathione, was determined by the Ê molecular replacement method and re®ned to 1.94 A resolution. The three-dimensional structure and the folding topology of the dimeric cGSTM1-1 closely resembles those of other class-mu GSTs. The bound inhibitor, S-hexylglutathione, orients in disparate directions in the two subunits. The combined space occupied by the hexyl moiety of the inhibitors overlaps with that reported for rGSTM1-1 co-crystallized with (9 S,10 S)-9-(S-glutathionyl)-10-hydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene. Conformational differences at a ¯exible loop (residue 35 to 40) were also observed between the crystal structures of cGSTM1-1 and rGSTM1-1. cGSTM1-1 has the highest epoxidase activity among all the class-mu enzymes reported. Tyr115, has been identi®ed as a residue that participates in the epoxidase activity of class-mu glutathione S-transferase and is conserved in cGSTM1-1. The epoxidase and trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2one conjugating activity of cGSTM1-1 are decreased drastically but not abolished by replacing Tyr115 with phenylalanine. The speci®city constant of the cGSTM1-1(Y115F) mutant, with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate, is 15-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme.

Introduction
Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of phase II detoxi®cation enzymes that catalyze the nucleophilic addition of glutathione to a wide spectrum of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents (Armstrong, 1991). They are also involved in the reduction of organic hydroperoxides (Tan et al., 1986), isomerization of prostaglandins (Christ-Hazelhof & Nutgeren, 1979) and act as carrier proteins for bilirubin (Bhargava et al., 1978), heme derivatives and thyroid hormones (Ishigaki et al., 1989). It has been proposed that GSTs may have an additional protective role by binding and immobilizing certain reactive electrophilic molAbbreviations used: GSTs, glutathione S-transferases; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; EA, ethacrynic acid; EPNP, 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane; tPBO, trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one; S.E.M., standard error of the mean; PEG, polyethylene glycol.

ecules, with subsequent inactivation of these compounds (Mannervik & Danielson, 1988). GST isozymes are grouped into at least six classes of ``super-families'', namely, alpha, mu, pi (Mannervik et al., 1985), theta (Meyer et al., 1991), sigma (Meyer & Thomas, 1995) and kappa (Pemble et al., 1996). Members within a class have distinguishing substrate and inhibitor speci®cities, similar exon-intron structure and share extensive (greater than 50%) sequence homology. Sequences in the N-terminal region as well as between positions 60 and 90 appear to be particularly well conserved within each class. Besides class-kappa, crystallographic structures have been reported for representative GSTs from the other ®ve classes (Ji et al., 1992; Lim et al., 1994; Raghunathan et al., 1994; Reinemer et al., 1991; Sinning et al., 1993). In spite of the low sequence identity among these isozymes in different classes, these proteins share a two-domain structure. The N-terminal domain I has an a/b structure, consists

The active site can be further subdivided into the glutathione-binding (G-site) and the hydrophobic substrate-binding site (H-site). The structure function relationships of GSTs are probably the most studied for class-mu isozymes. The crystal structures of the rat rGSTM1-1 complexed with glutathione (Ji et al., 1992) and its epoxy-conjugate (Ji et al., 1994) have been reported. Using site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies, residues important for the enzymatic activity (Johnson et al., 1993; Liu et al., 1992; Xiao et al., 1996) and stereoselectivity (Shan & Armstrong, 1994) of this rat isozyme have been identi®ed. Raghunathan et al. (1994) have also reported the structures of hGSTM2-2 crystals that were grown from solutions containing glutathionyl dinitrobenzene. The data showed signi®cant differences in the conformation of the active site between the rat and human class-mu isozymes, even though electron density can only be seen for the glutathione portion of the ligand. Here we report the structure of a chicken classmu GST, cGSTM1-1, co-crystallized with S-hexylglutathione. This isozyme was previously designated as CL2-2 according to its electrophoretic mobility on polyacryamide gel (Liu & Tam, 1991;

Chang et al., 1990). cGSTM1-1 has the highest epoxidase activity among all the class-mu GSTs reported. Tyr115, the residue that has been identi®ed as participating in the epoxidase activity of rGSTM1-1, is conserved in cGSTM1-1. Substitution of Tyr115 with phenylalanine diminished but not abolished the epoxidase activity of cGSTM1-1. This is the ®rst report of the structure of GST from an avian source.

Results and Discussion
Primary and overall structure The primary sequence of cGSTM1-1 is listed together with that of rGSTM3-3 (Abramovitz & Listowsky, 1987), rGSTM1-1 (Lai et al., 1986) and hGSTM2-2 (Vorachek et al., 1991) in Figure 1. cGSTM1-1 has the highest sequence identity with rGSTM3-3 (67%), an isozyme that is expressed predominantly in testis (Hsieh et al., 1997) and brain tissues (Johnson et al., 1992). Including conservative substitutions, the similarity between these two isozymes is 80%. cGSTM1-1 has 61% and 64% sequence identity with rGSTM1-1 and hGSTM2-2, respectively. Careful examination of the primary sequences reveals the presence of 119 conserved residues among these four isozymes. We identi®ed

241 gen bond interactions contributed by Lys33 of subunit B with Gly53 and Asp55 of subunit A from the neighboring molecule. Consequently, the loops of both subunits exhibit the highest temperature factors within the whole molecule (data not shown). Trp209 is situated near the C terminus and is part of the H-site. In subunit A, the distance between the center of the aromatic rings of Phe40 Ê and Trp209 is about 4.7 A. The tips of these two aromatic rings point roughly towards each other, forming an angle of approximately 45 . In contrast, the benzyl group of Phe40 from subunit B swings about 90 away from the dimer interface along the Ca ±Cb bond and trains towards the solvent as a result. The accompanying Trp209 side-chain rotates also along the Ca ±Cb bond by about 60 and points toward Asp8. Consequently, these two aromatic Ê rings measure 6.7 A from the center and orient in opposite directions. Smaller differences can be observed around residues 170 to 173 and 197 to 202, which are located at the loops after a6 and a8, respectively. These differences are probably due to chain ¯exibility. Higher thermal parameters for these residues, particularly at the solvent-exposed loop regions, can be detected. It is also interesting to point out that the polypeptide torsional angles (f and c) of Gln71 from both subunits are different. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) showed not the preferred f-c angles of Gln71 in subunit A but the favored values in subunit B. Whereas in rGSTM1-1, Gln71 assumes the energetically unfavorable values in both subunits (Ji et al., 1992). The orientation of the Gln71 sidechain in both subunits is similar due to restrictions imposed by interacting with the co-crystallized inhibitor and the surrounding amino acid sidechains. However, the main-chain N of Gln71 from subunit A makes strong van der Waals interactions Ê with the main-chain O of Pro60 (3.64 A) and the Ê side-chain Og2 of the substrate (3.66 A); whereas the main-chain N of Gln71 in subunit B is at a disÊ tance (>4.4 A) beyond interaction with these groups. Further biochemical and/or structural analyses are needed to con®rm whether the stereochemical difference of Gln71 is functionally important. Interactions between domains The contact regions between the domains are mainly from a1, a3 (parallel with each other) of domain I and a4, a6 (parallel with each other but antiparallel with a1 and a3) of domain II. Together, there are 224 and 203 interactions ranging from Ê Ê 2.3 A to 4.2 A for subunits A and B, respectively. The contacts are dominated by hydrophilic and van der Waals interactions. A long gap is formed between the two domains and is part of the H-site. Six amino acid residues (Asp8, Arg10, Gly11, Glu21, Arg31 and Arg77) from domain I of subunit A interact with ten residues (Glu97, Glu100,

20 residues that are identical among rGST3-3, rGST1-1 and hGSTM2-2 but substituted with chemically different residues (Gribskov & Burgess, 1986) on cGSTM1-1 (Figure 1). The effect of these substitutions will be discussed in a later section. The protein folding topology and the threedimensional structure of cGSTM1-1 (Figure 2) is quite similar to other GSTs from the mu-family, as expected from the high degree of sequence identity. The overall shape of this dimeric enzyme is globular with dimensions of approximately Ê Ê Ê 53 A Â 62 A Â 56 A, as reported for rGSTM1-1 (Ji et al., 1992). cGSTM1-1 can be divided into two structurally different domains that connect via a short polypeptide segment (residues 83 to 89), as in other GSTs. Structural variations between the two subunits The functional form of the protein is a homodimer, a conclusion that can be substantiated with gel ®ltration chromatographic results (data not shown). The two subunit structures of cGSTM1-1 are nearly identical. The Ca positions of the two monomers can be superimposed with a r.m.s. Ê difference of 0.46 A. The most distinctive conformational difference between the two subunits occurs at residues 35 to 40 (the mu loop) and the side-chain of Trp209. In the crystal packing environment, the mu loop of subunit A and B points toward a hydrophobic (Phe169, Phe169 and Trp214 of the neighboring molecule) and a hydrophilic environment (Arg95, Arg139 and Arg144 of the neighboring molecule), respectively. Therefore, the observed structural variations between the mu loop of the two subunits might be explained by the local packing environment. However, there are only two hydro-

242 Asp161, Asp164, Lys192, Arg201, Lys204, Pro206, Ile207 and Tyr210) in domain II, forming a total of 16 salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. In subunit B, Glu24 together with the same set of six amino acid residues as in domain I of subunit A interacts with 11 residues in domain II forming an array of 17 salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Met203 and Lys217 replace Tyr210 in this set from domain II of subunit B. Noticeably, Gly11 interacts with Ile207, Arg10 interacts with Lys204 and Pro206, while Asp8 hydrogen bonds with Tyr210 (subunit A) or Lys217 (subunit B). Apparently, the C-terminal tails of the subunits are stabilized through the domain-domain interactions. The Arg10 to Pro206, and the Asp8 to Tyr210 or Lys217 interactions have not been observed in the rGSTM1-1 model (Ji et al., 1992). Interactions between subunits The total solvent-accessible surface of the Ê cGSTM1-1 dimer is 18,578 A2. The monomerÊ monomer contact area is 2782 A2, a summation of Ê 2 and 1727 A2 of hydrophilic and hydroÊ 1055 A phobic surface area, respectively. The subunits' association can be visualized primarily as contacts between domain I of one subunit with domain II of the other subunit. The monomer-monomer form Ê a co-axial contact with 248 interactions (44.2 A) including 13 hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds result from interactions of Gln71, Asn73 and Arg81 of one subunit with Glu90, Asp97, Asn101 and Asp105 of the other. Arg81 from both subunits contributes seven of the 13 hydrogen bonds. Electrostatic interactions between hydrophilic residues on a3 (Gln71, Asn73 and Arg77) and a4 (Lys93, Gln94, Asp97, Asn101, Asp105, and Gln136) from both subunits can also be observed. The quanidino groups of Arg77 from each subunit are stacked on top of one another at the dimer interface. cGSTM1-1 exhibits similar characteristics as hGSTM2-2 (Raghunathan et al., 1994) for these residues. These arginine residues do not have the p-p interaction and hydrogen bonds as noted for rGSTM1-1 by Ji et al. (1992). There are two main groups of hydrophobic interactions that contribute to the dimer stabilization. Phe56 of domain I intercalated between a4 and a5 of the other subunit, interacts mainly with His102 and Phe140, while weakly with Val98, Leu99, Gln136 and Leu137. Together, Phe56 constitutes 23 van der Waals interactions with these six residues. Hydrophobic interactions between Gln94 of a4 with b4 (Val67 and Leu69) and a3 (Tyr78) can also be observed. The S-hexylglutathione binding site The glutathione moiety is sitting on top of b1, b2 and b3, and the N terminus of a1 and a3 from the ®rst domain. The side-chain of Asp105 from the other subunit is the only residue on domain II that interacts with the glutathione. On subunit A, the

speci®c binding of glutathione involves a network of polar interactions between the glutathione tripeptide and Tyr6, Trp7, Trp45, Lys49, Asn58, Leu59, Gln71, Ser72 and Asp105. Two of these, Lys49 and Leu59, are not among the residues that interact with the glutathione on subunit B. Together, there are 15 and ten hydrogen bonds between the glutathione and residues on subunits A and B, respectively. These interactions are summarized in Figure 3 and Table 1. The g-glutamyl group of the glutathione hydrogen bonds with Gln71 and Ser72 of one subunit, and Asp105 from the other. It provides approximately half of the interactions of glutathione with the isozyme. The a-carboxylate group hydrogenbonded to the main-chain NH and the hydroxyl group of Ser72, as well as a water molecule in subunit A (Figure 3). Widersten et al. (1996) has suggested the catalytic role of this carboxylate group for the class-alpha GSTs. In addition, this Ê group is also on the axis of and within 4 A of the N terminus of the a3 helix. The helix dipole of a3 may contribute as an electrostatic anchor for the tripeptide (Ji et al., 1992). The carboxylate group of the glycine residue interacts with Trp45, Lys49, Asn58 and a water molecule in subunit A. In subunit B, the glutathione Lys49 interaction is mediated via a water molecule. Together, two water molecules are H-bonded to the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the glycine. For other class-mu GSTs (rGSTM1-1 and hGSTM2-2) an interaction between glycine and Arg42 can be detected. On cGSTM1-1, due to an arginine to proline substitution, the glycine residue 42 interaction is absent. The sulfur atom of the glutathionyl cysteine hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr6. The importance of this interaction in the catalytic mechanism of GSTs has been reported by others (Ji et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1992; Reinemer et al., 1991). The main-chain oxygen of cysteine on the tripepÊ tide is less than 3 A from the Ne1 of Trp7. On subunit A, the main-chain nitrogen atom of cysteine forms two additional hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl of Leu59 and Od1 of Asn58. Hydrogen bonding of the sulfur atom on glutathione to water molecule(s) has been reported for rGSTM1-1 complexed with glutathione (Ji et al., 1992; Xiao et al., 1996). In contrast, this sulfur to water hydrogen bonding has not been observed for class-mu GSTs complexed with a glutathioneconjugate (Ji et al., 1994; Raghunathan et al., 1994; this work). Conceivably, the hydrophobic environment and the steric hindrance imposed by the derivative groups on glutathione might prevent the solvent molecule to interact with the sulfur atom. The H-site has a highly hydrophobic surface and lined mainly with non-polar residues from both domains I and II. It consists of the loop connecting b1 and a1, the C-terminal region of a4 and a6 and the C-terminal tail of the protein. The S-hexyl portion of the inhibitor adapts different orientations in the two subunits of cGSTM1-1. In subunit A, the

S-hexyl tail protrudes into a hydrophobic region formed by the loop connecting b1 and a1 of the ®rst domain and the C-terminal tail of the protein (residues 207 to 209). This region is coated by the main-chain backbone and side-chains of Ile9, Arg10, Gly11, Tyr115, Ile207, Phe208 and Trp209. In subunit B, the S-hexyl moiety points toward Arg107 of a4 and Gln165 of a6 instead of the C terminus as in subunit A. It makes van der Waals Ê contacts (44.2 A) with Tyr6, Gly11, Leu12, Arg107, Tyr115, Gln165, Ile207 and Phe208. Close-

up pictures of the S-hexyl tail with the interacting residues are presented in Figure 4. Interestingly, the orientations of the S-hexyl tail cover the two edges of the binding site for (9 S,10 S)-9-(S-glutathionyl)-10-hydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene on rGSTM1-1 (Johnson et al., 1993). Structural variations among cGSTM1-1, rGSTM1-1 and hGSTM2-2 As mentioned earlier, there are 20 residues (26, 34, 36, 42, 46, 94, 102, 110, 136, 137, 143, 145, 170,

174, 176, 177, 178, 181, 200 and 210) that are identical among rGST3-3, rGST1-1 and hGSTM2-2, but substituted with chemically different residues (Gribskov & Burgess, 1986) on cGSTM1-1. A cluster of ®ve substitutes can be detected among residues 170 to 178. The effect of these substitutions can be illustrated by superimposing the Ca positions of cGSTM1-1 with those of rGSTM1-1 and hGSTM2-2. This plot is presented in Figure 5 Ê and has a r.m.s. difference of 1.02 A (rGSTM1Ê Ê cGSTM1), 1.01 A (rGSTM1- hGSTM2) and 1.23 A (cGSTM1- hGSTM2). The loop connecting b2 and a2 (the unique mu loop) has three substitutions and is the major structural variance among cGSTM1-1, hGSTM2-2 and rGSTM1-1. The tip (residues 36 to 39) of the loop on cGSTM1-1 takes on a cis-Pro turn (residue 38). The additional proline on cGSTM1 at residue 36 causes the loop to bend away from the interior of the molecule (Figure 5). There is an additional proline at position 42. On other class-mu isozymes, residue 42 is an arginine that hydrogen bonds with glutathione. This region obviously constitutes the major differences among the overall shapes of cGSTM1-1-1, rGSTM1-1 and hGSTM2-2. Residues 94, 102, 136 and 137 on cGSTM1-1 are different from those on rGSTM1-1, M3-3 and hGSTM2-2. They are located on the dimer interface and provide hydrophobic interactions for dimer stabilization. Substitution of these amino acid residues apparently causes minimal variation on the structure. cGSTM1-1 has Pro at positions 172 and 174. The protein assumes a b-turn (170 to 172) and a short (one-and-a-half turn) helix-like (174 to 178) motif connecting a6 and a7. Conversely, rGSTM1-1 and hGSTM2-2 form two b-turns (170 to 173 and 174 to 177) at this region. Other noteworthy differences among cGSTM1-1, hGSTM2-2 and rGSTM1-1 are residues 9, 111 and

209. cGSTM1-1 has Ile and Ala at positions 9 and 111, respectively. The corresponding residues on rGSTM1-1 and hGSTM2-2 are valine and isoleucine. The importance of these two residues in the enzymic stereoselectivity towards enones and epoxides has been explored by mutagenesis studies (Shan & Armstrong, 1994). In the crystal structure of cGSTM1-1, Trp209 forms partial ring stacking with Trp7 and provides a highly continuous hydrophobic surface accessible to bulk solvent. The corresponding residues are Ser and Thr in rGSTM1-1 and hGSTM2-2, respectively. The large difference in size and polarity between Trp, Ser and Thr would result in signi®cant changes in local conformation, hydrophobicity, substrate speci®cities and enzymic activities. Substitution of Trp209 does cause substantial changes in the enzymic activity of cGSTM1-1 (C.-D.H. & M.F.T., unpublished results). Raghunathan et al. (1994) noted that the orientation of Tyr115, the relative position of a4 and the conformation of the C-terminal tail are the major differences between rGSTM1-1 and hGSTM2-2. In contrast, the a4 helix, Tyr115 and the C-terminal tail of cGSTM1-1 exhibit similar orientation and conformation as that of rGSTM1-1.

Enzymatic activities of wild-type cGSTM1-1 The cDNA clone of cGSTM1-1 is expressed in E. coli and the substrate speci®cities of the puri®ed protein are summarized in Table 2 with other class-mu enzymes for comparison. The 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) conjugation activity (23.6(Æ0.5) mmol/min per mg) of cGSTM1-1 is rather low compared to other classmu GSTs. We could not detect the 1,2-dichloro-4nitrobenzene and bromosulfophthalein conjugating activity or the isomerase activity using Á5androstene-3,17-dione as substrate. However, using 1,2-

epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane (EPNP) as substrate, cGSTM1-1 has a speci®c activity of 4.3(Æ0.08) mmol/min per mg, making it the most active epoxidase among all the class-mu GSTs reported (Hayes & Pulford, 1995). cGSTM1-1 also exhibited low levels of ethacrynic acid (EA) and trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one (tPBO) conjugating activity (0.29(Æ0.01) and 0.36(Æ0.01) mmol/min per

mg, respectively) as well as peroxidase activity (0.42(Æ0.02) mmol/min per mg). cGSTM1-1 has isoleucine and alanine at positions 9 and 111, respectively, and identical to those of rGSTM2-2. Using tPBO as substrate, over 90% of the products formed are of the A-type isomer (data not shown; Kubo & Armstrong, 1989). The results are in close agreement with those of

Shan & Armstrong (1994), who suggested the contribution of these two residues in the stereoselectivity and catalytic ef®ciency toward enones and epoxides. Enzymatic activities of the cGSTM1(Y115F) mutant Tyr115 has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of rGSTM1-1. Mutational studies then con®rmed that Tyr115 acts as an electrophile to stabilize the transition state for the addition of GSH to epoxide (Johnson et al., 1993) and 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one (Ji et al., 1994). Since the epoxidase activity of cGSTM1-1 is tenfold higher than rGSTM1-1, we replaced Tyr115 with phenylalanine in order to assess the contribution of this residue to the catalytic activity of cGSTM1-1. The kinetic properties of the wild-type and cGSTM1-1(Y115F) mutant are listed in Table 3 for comparison. The KGSH values are 0.051(Æ0.006) m and 0.14(Æ0.03) mM for the wild-type cGSTM1-1 and cGSTM1-1(Y115F) mutant, respectively. A slight difference in af®nity with GSH can be detected for these two enzymes. cGSTM1-1 has a higher KGSH than that of rGSTM1-1 (0.020 mM, Hu m & Colman, 1995), probably due to the Pro42 to arginine substitution. The Arg42 on rGSTM1-1

provides an additional hydrogen bond with the glycine carboxylate of glutathione. These two proteins have similar af®nity towards EPNP. We obtained KEPNP values of m 0.47(Æ0.07) and 0.44(Æ0.07) mM for the wildtype and cGSTM1(Y115F) mutant, respectively. However, the wild-type enzyme has a kEPNP of cat 4.33(Æ0.46) sÀ1, while the cGSTM1-1(Y115F) mutant has a kEPNP value of 0.082(Æ0.008) sÀ1. cat A 53-fold difference in kcat is observed between these two enzymes. The epoxidase activity of rGSTM1-1 has been appraised with phenanthrene 9,10-oxide (Johnson et al., 1993). By replacing Tyr115 with phenylalanine, the mutant has a kcat value of 0.0044 sÀ1, that is 87-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Johnson et al. (1993) presented convincing evidence that the hydroxyl group of Tyr115 participates in the epoxide catalysis. Based on the drastic decrease in kEPNP, a similar conclusion can be cat reached for cGSTM1-1 isozyme. However, the cGSTM1-1(Y115F) mutant still possesses signi®cant epoxidase activity (kcat  0.082 sÀ1), implying that other residue(s) partaking in the epoxidase reaction remain to be identi®ed. A similar situation has been observed with tPBO as substrate. The wild-type and the cGSTM11(Y115F) mutant have comparable KtPBO values m

(Table 3). The ktPBO value for the wild-type enzyme cat is 0.79(Æ0.14) sÀ1, while the value for the cGSTM11(Y115F) mutant (0.04(Æ0.005) sÀ1) is 20-fold lower. Again, it should be noted that the ktPBO value of the mutant is signi®cantly higher cat than the background. The tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation diminished but not abolished the tPBO conjugating activity of cGSTM1-1. Another characteristic of the cGSTM1-1(Y115F) mutant is the high CDNB-conjugating activity. This mutant has a KCDNB value of 0.76(Æ0.11) mM m and a kCDNB value of 188.3(Æ20.5) sÀ1. The specicat ®city constant (kcat/Km) of the mutant that re¯ects the activation and binding energies between free enzyme and free substrate (Danielson et al., 1987) is 15-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. The rate-limiting step of the CDNB conjugation reaction has been suggested to be a physical event (Johnson et al., 1993; Ricci et al., 1996). This hypothesis was tested in cGSTM1-1 by measuring the kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant

enzyme in the presence of viscosogens. The results are plotted in Figure 6 and demonstrate clearly that binding of CDNB and the speci®city constants of the wild-type and Y115F mutant are diffusioncontrolled processes. The mechanism of CDNB conjugation has been investigated with rGSTM1-1 and its Y115F mutant (Johnson et al., 1993). The speci®city constant of the mutant is 1.6-fold higher than that of the wild-type rGSTM1-1. In rGSTM1-1, Tyr115 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the hydroxyl group of the Ê side-chain (2.46 to 2.78 A) as well as the mainchain amide nitrogen of Ser209 (Ji et al., 1994). Johnson et al. (1993) suggested the Tyr115 and Ser209 interactions would constrain the movement of a4/a5 and the C-terminal fragment. Consequently, there is a decrease in the off-rate of the product from the active site. This hindrance is removed from the Y115F mutant, resulting in a more active enzyme. The Y115F mutant has also been constructed for hGSTM2-2 (Penington & Rule, 1992). The hGSTM2-2 enzyme has a Thr at position 209. More importantly, the phenoxyl side-chain of Tyr115 varies in the different crystal forms and points either towards or parallel to the glutathione moiety, precluding any possibility of interacting with Thr209 (Raghunathan et al., 1994). The shortest distance between the hydroxyl group of Tyr115 and the main-chain amide nitrogen of Thr209 is Ê 10.81 A. Replacement of Tyr115 with phenylalanine in hGSTM2-2 reported only a 10% increase in speci®c activity towards CDNB (Penington & Rule, 1992). The results match those predicted from the hGSTM2-2 model. The cGSTM1-1 has a tryptophan at position 209 that has a more bulky side-chain than serine or threonine. The side-chain of tryptophan is pointing away from Tyr115. The indole nitrogen is Ê 7.22 A away and cannot interact with the hydroxyl group of Tyr115. However, Tyr115 is within HÊ bonding distance (3.09 and 2.59 A in subunit A and B, respectively) of the main-chain amide nitrogen of Trp209. The H-bonding between Tyr115 and Trp209 would be interrupted by replacing the tyrosine with phenylalanine. However, whether abolishing this H-bond could account for the 15fold increase in speci®city constant remains to be

248 investigated. A similar mutation in rGSTM1-1 results in only a 1.6-fold increase in the speci®city constant. In summary, we have elucidated the X-ray crystal structure of cGSTM1-1, an avian class-mu GST, Ê at 1.94 A resolution. This enzyme has the highest epoxidase activity among all the class-mu GSTs reported so far. Substitution of Tyr115 with phenylalanine diminished but not abolished the epoxidase activity of the enzyme.

Crystal Structure of cGSTM1-1 the crystals belong to space group P212121 with cell Ê Ê Ê dimensions a  61.26 A, b  88.03 A, c  93.49 A, Ê a  b  g  90 , and diffract to 1.94 A. The Vm value Ê (Matthews, 1968) was calculated to be 2.45 A3/dalton. The solvent content is estimated to be 50%, presuming that each dimer occupies one asymmetric unit. Data collection and processing X-ray intensity data were collected using CuKa radiation from a single crystal on a Rigaku R-AXIS II imaging plate system operated at 50 kV and 80 mA. The program DENZO (Otwinowski, 1993) was used to index images, integrate intensities, and scale data. Table 4 summarizes the data statistics and the ®nal data set used for the re®nement. Molecular replacement The program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1990) was used in the rotation and translation searches as well as for the re®nement of the resulting rotational and translational parÊ ameters of the molecules in the cell. The 2.2 A resolution X-ray structure of rGSTM1-1 complexed with GSH (Ji et al., 1992) was used as the search model. Due to the high sequence identity between these two isozymes (133 out of 219 residues are identical), the search model included all the side-chains from conserved residues, and all the non-conserved residues were replaced with Gly. In addition, the glutathione substrate was not included in the probe model. For the rotational search, the model was placed in an orthogonal P1 cell with axes Ê of length 150 A. X-ray diffraction data (>2s (F) and 15 to Ê 4 A resolution) were used for the cross-rotational function calculation. The highest peak in the rotation function occurred at y1  263.29 , y2  25.275 and y3  165.88 , with a peak height of 7.38s. After Patterson correlation re®nement, the solution corresponded to the highest peak in the map. For the translation searches, a data Ê shell for rotation with a grid size of 0.5 A was used. The translation function produced a unique solution at x  0.097, y  0.198 and z  0.323 with a peak height of 49.8s (the next two highest peaks are 46.2s and 45.9s). Crystallographic refinement Structure re®nement was carried out using the XPLOR program package (Brunger & Krukowski, 1990). The ®rst step was a rigid-body re®nement. The probe model was used as a group to optimize their orientional Ê and translational parameters by 8 to 3 A resolution. The Table 4. Summary of diffraction data and re®nement

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification The Bluescript phagemid (pGCL201), containing the coding region of the wild-type cGSTM1-1 subunit, has been described (Liu & Tam, 1991). General DNA manipulation technqiues were employed for generating the Y115F mutant and introducing the coding region into the pBAce expression vector (Craig et al., 1991). The pBAce expression vectors were then transformed into E. coli TG1 cells for protein expression as outlined by Liu et al. (1993). Proteins were puri®ed with a GSH af®nity column as outlined by Liu et al. (1997). The GST subunits were eluted off the column with either buffer A (10 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM ethylenedinitrilo-tetraacetic acid, 6 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM S-hexylglutathione) or buffer B (10 mM Caps (pH 11.0), 1 mM ethylenedinitrilo-tetraacetic acid, 6 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM GSH). Proteins which eluted off the af®nity column in the presence of S-hexylglutathione were used for crystallization, while those eluted off the column with buffer B were used exclusively for kinetic studies. Proteins after af®nity column chromatography, were immediately desalted by gel ®ltration on a preparative Superose 12 column that was equilibrated with 150 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). The molecular masses and the purity of the recombinant proteins were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (Yeh et al., 1995). The N-terminal sequences of the expressed proteins were con®rmed and quantitated by Edman degradation (Shen et al., 1993). Approximately 85% of the initiator methionine residues were retained on the wild-type cGSTM1-1 and mutants. Routinely, roughly 10 mg of recombinant proteins can be recovered from a liter of cell culture. Crystallization of cGSTM1-1 Crystals of the cGSTM1-1 were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from a 10 mg/ml protein solution in 0.01% (w/v) NaN3. A crystal kit (Hampton Research, screen I) was utilized for preliminary screening in initial experiments. Only probe number 10 (30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 0.2 M ammonium acetate) yielded crystals that were broom-like in shape at room temperature and were unusable. In the second stage, the amount of precipitant and glycerol were varied. The best crystals were obtained with 12.5% PEG3350, 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 10% (v/v) glycerol, against a reservoir of the above buffer with 25% PEG3350. Small needle-shaped crystals appeared in about one day and grew to a size of 0.7 mm Â 0.1 mm Â 0.1 mm within two weeks. The systematic absences and Laue symmetry indicate that

(a) and (b) Subunit A and B, respectively. R factor after the rigid-body re®nement was 43.8%. The second step was an atomic position re®nement by conjugate gradient minimization. The two monomers of the dimer molecule in the asymmetric unit were treated by non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. This treatment Ê reduced the R factor to 34% at 8 to 2.5 A. At this point a 2|Fo| À |Fc| electron density map was calculated to recover the side-chains replaced with Gly residues. The map showed those side-chains that had not been included in the initial model. After rebuilding these residues, the simulated annealing (SA) protocol was used. The two monomers of the asymmetric unit were then re®ned independently. Only half of the relative weight (WA) was used to reduce the possibility of over®tting the

250
model during the SA-re®nement. The R-factor was dropped to 25.3% after SA re®nement. At this point, the Annealed omit map protocol was used to generate the omit map. The cGSTM1-1 for crystallization studies was eluted from the af®nity column with S-hexylglutathione. This inhibitor binds strongly to the protein and cannot be removed by gel ®ltration chromatography (M.F.T., unpublished observation). Therefore, various difference Fourier maps were calculated to detect the presence of the glutathione analog in the active site. The electron density maps using 3s contour of |Fo| À |Fc| and 1.5s contour of 2|Fo| À |Fc| revealed the presence of continuous electron densities resembling S-hexylglutathione in the active sites of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit. The S-hexylglutathione molecules were then ®tted manually into the extra densities present in these two monomers. However, the maps did not show clear density of the two missing residues (218 and 219) located at the C terminus of the probe model. The re®nement was continued by gradually increasing Ê Ê the resolution of the data from 2.5 A to 1.94 A, with the R-factor remaining at 24%. At this point, water molecules were added to the model as oxygen atoms. To locate possible water molecules, the ``|Fo| À |Fc|`` difference Fourier map was examined for positive density with peak height above 2.5s and located within disÊ tance (2.5 to 3.5 A) of potential hydrogen bond donor or acceptor (O and N atoms) on the protein or other water molecules. During the re®nement, the occupancies of these water molecules (oxygen atoms) were ®xed at 1.0, then the locations and the temperature factors were re®ned. Water molecules exhibiting temperature factors Ê above 50 A2 after several cycles of re®nement were removed from the model. A total of 57 water molecules were identi®ed. At this stage, the full relative weight (WA) was then used in the ®nal re®nement. After the ®nal re®nement process, the R-factor was 22.3% for all 2s(F) data Ê between 6.0 and 1.94 A. Using a 10% re¯ection test set (3108 re¯ections) the Rfree value (Brunger, 1992) was 29.1%. The model has good stereochemistry with rootmean-square (r.m.s.) deviations in bond lengths and Ê bond angels of 0.01 A and 1.7 , respectively. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot showed only three residues (Asn215 of both subunits and Gln71 of subunit A) in generously allowed regions. The 2|Fo| À |Fc| omitted density maps of S-hexylglutathione from both monomers and superimposed with the ®nal re®ned model, are shown in Figure 7. Atomic coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977), accession code 1GSU. Enzymatic assay and determination of kinetic constants Enzyme activities were determined at 25 C as described (Habig et al., 1974; Lawrence & Burk, 1976). The rates of all the enzymatic reactions were obtained by subtracting the non-enzymatic rates from the observed reaction rates. The absorption coef®cient of the recombinant protein was determined according to the protocol of Gill & von Hippel (1989). Protein solutions of cGSTM1-1 and cGSTM1-1(Y115F) with 1 A280 unit correspond to concentrations of 0.56 and 0.60 mg/ml, respectively. Km and kcat were determined using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), ethacrynic acid (EA), 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-

All measurements were carried out in the presence of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). The KGSH value for cGSTM1-1 m was obtained at 1 mM CDNB and 0.02 to 0.1 mM GSH while that for cGSTM1-1(Y115F) at 1 mM CDNB and 0.035 to 0.2 mM GSH. The KCDNB and kCDNB were determ cat mined at 1 mM GSH and 0.2 to 1 mM CDNB. With EPNP and EA as substrates, the kinetic constants were calculated at 5 mM GSH in the presence of 0.15 to 0.5 mM EPNP and 0.01 to 0.05 mM EA, respectively. The KtPBO and ktPBO values for cGSTM1-1 and cGSTM1m cat 1(Y115F) were obtained at 2.5 mM and 25 mM GSH, respectively, with the tPBO concentration varied from 0.01 to 0.05 mM. The effect of viscosity on kinetic parameters and cooperativity was assayed at 25 C in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing variable glycerol concentrations. Viscosity values (Z) were calculated as described (Ricci et al., 1996) and reported relative to that of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) (Z0).
