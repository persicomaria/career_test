Abstract Eukaryotic histone proteins condense DNA into compact structures called nucleosomes. Nucleosomes were viewed as a distinguishing feature of eukaryotes prior to identification of histone orthologs in methanogens. Although evolutionarily distinct from methanogens, the methane-producing hyperthermophile Methanopyrus kandleri produces a novel, 154-residue histone (HMk). Amino acid sequence comparisons show that HMk differs from both methanogenic and eukaryotic histones, in that it contains two histone-fold motifs within a single chain. The two HMk histone-fold motifs, N and C terminal, are 28% identical in amino acid sequence to each other and 21% identical in amino acid sequence to other histone proteins. Here we present the 1.37-Å-resolution crystal structure of HMk and report that the HMk monomer structure is homologous to the eukaryotic histone heterodimers. In the crystal, HMk forms a dimer homologous to [H3­H4]2 in the eukaryotic nucleosome. Based on the spatial similarities to structural motifs found in the eukaryotic nucleosome that are important for DNA-binding, we infer that the Methanopyrus histone binds DNA in a manner similar to the eukaryotic histone tetramer [H3­H4]2.

viewed as a distinguishing feature of eukaryotes until histone orthologs were identified in methanogens (Sandman et al. 1990). Recently an unusual histone has been identified in Methanopyrus kandleri (Slesarev et al. 1998), an organism that is among the most heat-tolerant of hyperthermophilic prokaryotes, with a maximum growth temperature of 112°C. Although it produces methane, Methanopyrus is phylogenetically unrelated to other methanogens (Burggraf et al. 1991). When the Methanopyrus histone protein gene was isolated (Slesarev et al. 1998), its sequence was found to contain unique features as well as features that were intermediate between those found in methanogens (Sandman et al. 1990; Reeve et al. 1997) and in eukaryotes (Thomas and Kornberg 1975; Klug et al. 1980; Arents and Moudrianakis

1995; Luger et al. 1997). Initial amino acid sequence comparisons showed that the Methanopyrus histone (HMk) is twice the length, at 154 residues, of methanogen histones (Reeve et al. 1997). HMk differs from all other histones, both methanogenic and eukaryotic, in containing two histone-fold motifs within a single HMk chain. The two HMk histone-fold motifs, N and C terminal, are 28% identical in amino acid sequence to each other and 21% identical in amino acid sequence to other histones (Slesarev et al. 1998). Here we present the 1.37-Å-resolution crystal structure of HMk. Consisting of a tandem repeat of the histone fold, the HMk monomer structure is similar to a eukaryotic histone heterodimer. In the crystal, HMk forms a dimer homologous to [H3­H4]2 in the eukaryotic nucleosome. We infer that the Methanopyrus histone binds DNA in a manner similar to the eukaryotic histone tetramer [H3­H4]2, based on the spatial similarities to structural motifs found in the eukaryotic nucleosome that are important for DNA-binding. Results and Discussion Structure of HMk The Methanopyrus histone crystal structure was determined using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing and refined to 1.37-Å resolution using SHELXL to a final R factor of 16.3% (Table 1). HMk crystals belong to 57.4, c 97.0) and contain 1 space group P41212 (a HMk monomer per asymmetric unit. The HMk monomer structure contains two histone-fold domains (Fig. 1A), an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain, which are assembled like a eukaryotic histone heterodimer (Figs. 1A, 2A). Three helices in a short­long­short arrangement comprise each histone-fold domain. The two domains of HMk are related by a pseudo-2-fold axis along the long molecular axis. These domains are connected by a 13-residue coil at the center of the molecule, colored orange in Figure 1A. The interdomain interface is composed of apolar contacts, mostly alanine, leucine, and isoleucine side chains, which bury 1750 Å2 of surface area in each of the two domains (Fig. 3). Because the N- and C-terminal domains are oriented antiparallel to one another, helices 1N and 1C are on one molecular face, and helices 3N and 3C are on the other (Fig. 1A). Short -strands from each domain, found at both ends of the molecule, form two short parallel -sheets. The HMk dimer is formed by a crystallographic 2-fold rotation about an axis tilted 30° with respect to the long molecular axis (Figs. 1B, 2A right). The dimer interface is a four-helix bundle, formed between the N-terminal domain helices 2N, 3N, and their symmetry mates. Twentyseven residues, mostly small, apolar side chains, bury 1150 Å2 of surface area per monomer in this dimer interface (Fig. 3). Two salt bridges formed between Lys 55 and Glu 61 and

their symmetry mates span the dimer interface at the fourhelix bundle (Fig. 1B). Comparison of HMk to other histones Whereas amino acid sequence alignments reveal low, but significant, sequence identity among HMk, methanogen, and eukaryotic histones (Fig. 3), structural alignments strongly identify common secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures among HMk, methanogen, and eukaryotic histones (Fig. 4) that align, yielding low root mean square deviations (RMSDs). The N- and C-terminal domains of HMk align with an RMSD of 2.0 Å, and the HMk monomer aligns to other histone dimers with RMSDs between 1.5 and 2.7 Å (Satow et al. 1986; Starich et al. 1996; Luger et al. 1997). The histone folds are similar among HMk, methanogen, and eukaryotic histones, although eukaryotic histone H3 has an elongated helix 1. Like the methanogen histones, HMk lacks the N- or C-terminal extensions found in eukaryotic histones, where they are essential for

down-regulating nucleosome assembly and play a role in higher nucleosome assembly (Luger et al. 1997; de la Barre et al. 2000). The HMk dimer aligns well with the eukaryotic [H3­ H4]2 tetramer with an RMSD of 2.0 Å (Fig. 4D; Satow et al. 1986; Luger et al. 1997), but differs in certain aspects. The HMk dimer assembly has a -shaped appearance wherein the four-helix bundle is at the point of the  and an HMk monomer lies along each arm of the . In the HMk dimer, the two arms of the  are drawn together compared to [H3­H4]2 (Fig. 4D). Closing these arms has the consequence in the HMk dimer that there is more surface area buried per monomer relative to the eukaryotic histones (1153 Å2 in HMk vs. 628 Å2 in H3­H4). The HMk monomer is homologous to both eukaryotic heterodimers [H2A­H2B] and [H3­H4]. When H3­H4 and H2A­H2B dimers in the eukaryotic structure are replaced with their HMk homolog, four-helix-bundle interactions are observed at four locations in the model. Two of these occur between HMk 3N helices and two between HMk 3C helices. This contrasts with the HMk crystal structure, where the terminal ends of the two 3C helices are used to form a  -arm closure structure, thereby effectively preventing formation of two of the four-helix bundles that were found in the modeled eukaryotic nucleosome. This suggests that the  -arm closure structure may have a role in preventing formation of higher-order structures. 2004

Function of HMk HMk associates with and condenses DNA similarly to the eukaryotic histones, suggesting a physiological role for HMk in DNA condensation (Musgrave et al. 2000). Similarities between regions in the eukaryotic histones that are important for protein­DNA interactions in the eukaryotic nucleosome structure and the corresponding regions in HMk indicate that HMk binds DNA in a manner similar to that of the eukaryotic histones. In the eukaryotic nucleosome structure there are three regions responsible for DNAbinding: an 1 1 site, formed by the N-terminal 1 helices; and two L1L2 binding sites, formed by an L1-Arg and an L2-Thr from different histone monomers, located at both ends of the long molecular axis of the histone dimers (Fig. 3; Luger et al. 1997). The 1 1 motif in HMk formed by 1N and 1C is about equivalent in charge and charged residue positioning to the [H3­H4] 1 1 motif (+7 charge in HMk vs. +8 in [H3­H4]; Fig. 3). L1L2 motifs are found at both ends of the HMk molecule formed between R22­ T134 and R99­T57 (Fig. 3). A structural alignment between the HMk dimer and [H3­H4]2 + DNA (Luger et al. 1997) shows similarly placed histone structural elements between the HMk dimer and [H3­H4]2 relative to the DNA. This alignment indicates that HMk would bind DNA, forming a left-handed spiral assembly, and is in agreement with biochemical data that indicate that HMk binds DNA, forming a left-handed spiral assembly (Musgrave et al. 2000).

Methanopyrus kandleri histone structure

Materials and methods Protein preparation
Chemically competent Escherichia coli methionine auxotrophic strain BL21 (Novagen BL21-DE3 ) cells were prepared and transformed with a pet32 plasmid encoding for HMk. Selenomethionyl HMk was produced using the previously published growth protocol (Slesarev et al. 1998) and an established selenomethionineincorporation protocol (Hendrickson et al. 1990; Yang et al. 1990). Electrospray mass spectrometry demonstrated the protein produced was full-length, fully incorporated selenomethionyl protein (data not shown).

Crystallization and data collection
Fig. 2. Nomenclature and schematic representation of assemblies observed for several histones. The histone fold is stylized here as a pointed N terminus representing the short helix 1, a long central region representing the longer helix 2, and a rounded C terminus representing the short helix 3. A eukaryotic nucleosome is comprised of 145­147 bp of DNA and two copies each of four histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) (Thomas and Kornberg 1975; Arents and Moudrianakis 1995; Luger et al. 1997). A complete nucleosome histone octomer may be viewed as a left-handed spiral protein assembly constructed from three subassemblies. (A) (Left) An HMk monomer contains two histone-fold motifs, the N- and C-terminal domains, tethered by a 13-residue loop. (Right) An HMk dimer formed through crystallographic contacts associates through C-terminal helices of the N-terminal domain. (B) (Left) The eight histone proteins assemble as two copies each of two different heterodimers (H2A­H2B and H3­H4) (Thomas and Kornberg 1975; Luger et al. 1997). (Center) [H3­H4] assembles as [H3­H4]2. This complex initiates DNA-binding, positions the nucleosome, and forms stable nucleosomelike structures in complex with DNA (Dong and van Holde 1991; Hayes et al. 1991). (Right) The nucleosome is completed by adding [H2A­H2B] to each end of the [H3­H4]2 tetramer.

Selenomethionyl-HMk (SeHMk) was concentrated to 20 mg/mL in 1M NaCl, 50 mM Tris at pH 8.0, and 1 mM ME. Optimal HMk crystals were obtained by suspending a 1- L hanging drop of the protein solution over a well containing 50 mM Tris at pH 8.5 and 400 mM NaCl. SeHMk crystallized as tetragonal bipyramids in space group P41212 (a 57.4 Å, c 97.0 Å) with 1 molecule 2.35 Å3/D). Crystals were cryoproper asymmetric unit (Vm tected using a solution of 40% MPD, 400 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris at pH 8.5. No increase in mosaicity and little change in unit cell dimensions were noted upon freezing the crystals. Selenomethionyl-HMk data usable to 1.37 Å were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline A-2.

MAD data collection and phasing
Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data were collected at beamline X12C at National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) using a Brandeis 2X2 CCD detector. MAD data for phasing were collected using a single cryoprotected SeHMk crystal. A 3-wavelength MAD experiment was performed. These data were collected to 1.47-Å resolution. Data from the 3-wavelength MAD experiment were indexed, integrated, and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor 1997). Phases were obtained using SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen 1999).

HMk as an intermediate Nucleosomes are present in all eukaryotes. Therefore, it can be assumed that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes possessed nucleosomes; their origins would appear to be even earlier. Histones are also found in methanogens. Methanogen histones have a histone fold, and they compact DNA into regular nucleosomelike structures. They are therefore orthologous to eukaryotic histones (Starich et al. 1996; Reeve et al. 1997; Slesarev et al. 1998; Zhu et al. 1998; Musgrave et al. 2000). Methanopyrus kandleri is phylogenetically distinct from methanogens and, consistent with this, its histone, which contains a tandem repeat of the histone fold in a single chain, differs from those found in methanogens. The structural similarities between the Methanopyrus HMk dimer and its [H3­H4]2 ortholog in eukaryotes indicate that the HMk structure is intermediate between that of methanogens and eukaryotes, and provides a glimpse into a step in the evolution of the eukaryotic nucleosome.

Model building and refinement
The initial 1.50-Å electron density map was obtained from phasing the MAD experiment, low-remote wavelength ( 0.95 Å). The map quality was improved through solvent flattening and histogram matching using DM (CCP4) (Cowtan 1994), which increased the figure of merit from 0.63 to 0.72. In the initial building round, 151 residues of 154 were manually placed into the modified electron density using the baton-build and lego-side-chain algorithms in O (Jones et al. 1991). Real-space refinement in O was then used to better fit the model to electron density. The 1.5-Å model was refined through a single refinement round using phase-restrained positional, then phase-restrained, simulated annealing refinements in CNS Version 0.4 (Brunger et al. 1998). The resulting gap between R and Rfree was small (31.4% vs. 33.0%). This model was then used to phase directly the 1.37-Å resolution Se-Met dataset from SSRL, and refinement proceeded using SHELXL (Sheldrick and Schneider 1997). Riding hydrogen atoms, added using the automatic hydrogen-building routines in SHELXL, and anisotropic U values were refined in the last few refinement rounds. The final round of refinement included all data in a full-matrix, least-squares

refinement protocol that included anisotropic temperature-factor refinement. The structure was evaluated after almost every refinement round using several programs; PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. 1996), WHATCHECK (Hooft et al. 1996), ERRAT (Colovos and Yeates 1993), 3D-1D profiles (Bowie et al. 1991), and SFCHECK (Vaguine et al. 1999). The HMk model contains residues 4­154 (26 residues with multiple conformations), 182 water atoms (4 with multiple conformations), and 1 Cl- ion. Surface area buried in

the various histone assemblies was calculated using CNS Version 0.4 (Lee and Richards 1971; Brunger et al. 1998).
