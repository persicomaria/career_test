ABSTRACT Acetylornithine aminotransferase (AcOAT) is one of the key enzymes involved in arginine metabolism and catalyzes the conversion of N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde to N-acetylornithine (AcOrn) in the presence of L-glutamate. It belongs to the Type I subgroup II family of pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes. E. coli biosynthetic AcOAT (eAcOAT) also catalyzes the conversion of N-succinyl-L-2-amino-6-oxopimelate to N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelate, one of the steps in lysine biosynthesis. In view of the critical role of AcOAT in lysine and arginine biosynthesis, structural studies were initiated on the enzyme from S. typhimurium (sAcOAT). The Km and kcat/Km values determined with the purified sAcOAT suggested that the enzyme had much higher affinity for AcOrn than for ornithine (Orn) and was more efficient than eAcOAT. sAcOAT was inhibited by gabaculine (Gcn) with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 7 lM and a second-order rate constant (k2) of 0.16 mM21 s21. sAcOAT, crystallized in the unliganded form and in the presence of Gcn or L-glutamate, diffracted to a maximum resolu° tion of 1.90 A and contained a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure of unliganded sAcOAT showed significant electron density for PLP in only one of the subunits (subunit A). The asymmetry in PLP binding could be attributed to the ordering of the loop Lak-bm in only one subunit (subunit B; the loop from subunit B comes close to the phosphate group of PLP in subunit A). Structural and spectral studies of sAcOAT with Gcn suggested that the enzyme might have a low affinity for PLP-Gcn complex. Comparison of sAcOAT with T. thermophilus AcOAT and human ornithine aminotransferase suggested that the higher specificity of sAcOAT towards AcOrn may not be due to specific changes in the active site residues but could result from minor conformational changes in some of them. This is the first structural report of AcOAT from a mesophilic organism and could serve as a basis for drug design as the enzyme is important for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.

INTRODUCTION Pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (PLP) is one of the most versatile cofactors of enzymes that use amino acids as substrates. Recent genomic analysis shows that PLP-dependent enzymes constitute $1.5% of the total genes in prokaryotes.1 The common reactions catalyzed by PLP-dependent enzymes include transamination, racemization, decarboxylation, and b/g elimination/replacement. In spite of their functional diversity, PLP-dependent enzymes belong to a limited number of structural folds.2 In prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, biosynthesis of arginine takes place via a series of N-acetylated intermediates.3­9 N-acetylornithine (AcOrn) aminotransferase (AcOAT) (EC 2.6.1.11) is one of the key enzymes involved in this pathway. It catalyzes the reversible conversion of N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde (NAGSA) to AcOrn [Fig. 1(a)].10­13 AcOAT belongs to the fold Type I (a family) subgroup II of PLP-dependent enzymes. The unique feature of most of the enzymes of this subgroup of aminotransferases is that a distal amino group is involved in transamination.14 Some of the other enzymes that belong to this subgroup are ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GABA-AT), 2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase, alanine-glyoxalate aminotransferase, lysine aminotransferase, and glutamate-1Abbreviations: AcOAT, acetylornithine aminotransferase; AcOrn, acetylornithine; DAP, diaminopimelate; GABA-AT, 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase; Gcn, gabaculine; hOAT, human OAT; IA, internal aldimine; NAGSA, N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde; OAT, ornithine aminotransferase; PLP, pyridoxal 50 -phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine monophosphate; pOAT, OAT from Plasmodium yoelli; POI, N~2~-Acetyl-N~5~-({3-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]pyridin-4-yl}methyl)-L-ornithine; PPE, 4-[(1,3-Dicarboxy-propylamino)-methyl]-3-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-phosphonooxymethyl-pyridinium; sAcOAT, AcOAT from S. typhimurium; tAcOAT, AcOAT from Thermus thermophilus HB8.

semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase.15,16 The mechanism of catalysis is similar to those of other aminotransferases in which PLP and L-glutamate form pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP) and a-ketoglutarate in one half of the reaction. NAGSA is converted to AcOrn in the other half of the reaction along with the conversion of PMP to PLP.17,18 The substrate specificity of these enzymes is confined to the part involving NAGSA or AcOrn. The other part of the reaction is common to most aminotransferases. AcOAT from Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) shares a

sequence identity of 33% with human OAT (hOAT). The substrates of the two enzymes differ only by an acetyl group. OAT is highly specific to Orn. In contrast, AcOAT can accept both AcOrn and Orn as substrates.19­22 In addition to the conversion of NAGSA to AcOrn, the biosynthetic E. coli AcOAT also catalyses equally efficiently, the conversion of N-succinyl-L-2-amino-6-oxopimelate to N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelate, one of the steps in mesodiaminopimelate (DAP)/lysine biosynthetic pathway19 [Fig. 1(b)].

way, are known to function as crosslinking moieties in the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell wall. Therefore, AcOAT could serve as a target for designing antibacterials. Gabaculine (5-amino-1, 3-cyclohexadienylcarboxylic acid (Gcn)) is a naturally occurring organic compound, first isolated from Streptomyces toyocaenis. It is known to act as an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-AT and OAT.23,24 Initially, it forms an external aldimine with PLP by a trans Schiffization reaction followed by proton abstraction at the b-carbon position of Gcn leading to aromatization. As a result, a stable PLP-Gcn complex m-carboxyphenylpyridoamine phosphate [Fig. 1(c)] is formed.23 Since the substrates of OAT and AcOAT are structurally similar, Gcn could act as a potent inhibitor of AcOAT also. In this article, we describe the biochemical properties of sAcOAT and its interactions with the substrates AcOrn and Orn, studies on its inhibition by Gcn and its three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure. The structure of AcOAT has been compared with OAT25­27 and other Type I subgroup II aminotransferases28­30 with the goal of obtaining information on their structural similarity and substrate specificity. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning, overexpression, and purification

substrate concentration to the Michaelis­Menten equation, v ¼ ðVmax ½SÞ=ðKm þ ½SÞ using the nonlinear regression analysis option of the GraphPad Prism software. kcat was calculated using the monomeric molecular mass of the enzyme. Gcn inhibition of sAcOAT was estimated by incubating the enzyme with various concentrations of the inhibitor for 10 min followed by recording the absorption at 413 nm. Ki was calculated from a plot of the reciprocal of absorbance at 413 nm against concentration.32 All graphs were plotted using the Sigma Plot software. The second-order rate constant for the inhibition of sAcOAT by Gcn was calculated by monitoring spectral changes as well as by measuring enzymatic activity. The enzyme (1 mg ml21) was incubated with various concentrations of Gcn (0.03­1.0 mM) for different periods of time. Ten microliters of the incubated sample was added to the assay mixture (final volume 200 ll). It was ensured that the amount of Gcn carried over during the assay did not cause significant decrease in activity. ln (% remaining activity) was plotted against incubation time. Pseudo first-order rate constants were obtained from the slopes of the fitted straight-lines. The pseudo first-order rate constants were then plotted against the concentration of Gcn as a log­log plot and a straight line was fitted. Secondorder rate constant (k2) was determined from the Y-intercept of this straight line. Spectral changes resulting from the addition of Gcn (300­550 nm) were recorded. Using the spectral data, pseudo first- and second-order rate constants were estimated following methods used for estimating these constants by enzyme activity measurements.
Crystallization, data collection and processing

sAcOAT was cloned, overexpressed, and purified as described in Rajaram et al.31 Briefly, sAcOAT gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of S. typhimurium using specific sense and antisense primers and cloned into pRSET `C' vector using the restriction enzymes NheI and BamHI. The enzyme was overexpressed in BL21 pLys S cells and purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.
Kinetic studies on sAcOAT

All assays were performed at 258C using a JASCO UV­ visible spectrometer equipped with thermospacers and connected to a constant-temperature circulating water bath. Activity of sAcOAT was measured at 340 nm, by monitoring the rate of NADPH formation in a coupled reaction resulting from the NADP-dependent conversion of L-glutamate to a-ketoglutarate and ammonia by glutamate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate AcOrn to a concentration of 1 mM to 0.2 ml of solution containing sAcOAT, 20 mM CAPSO (pH 9.5), 0.5 mM a-ketoglutarate, 0.5 mM NADP, and 5 units of glutamate dehydrogenase (assay mixture). Kinetic parameters (Km, kcat) were estimated by measuring the activity at 10 or more concentrations of the substrate varying from 0.003­3.0 mM. Enzymatic activity using Orn (0.1­5 mM) as the substrate was measured similarly. Experiments were repeated at least three times with enzymes from independent purifications. Kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the initial velocity versus

sAcOAT crystallized in the presence of 1 mM Gcn in hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments.31 The crystallization buffer contained 20% PEG 3350, 0.5M ammonium acetate, and 0.1M HEPES pH 7.0.31 Crystals of the enzyme were also obtained in the presence of 10 mM Lglutamate or in the absence of any ligand under similar conditions. The crystals were flash frozen using 20% ethylene glycol as the cryo-protectant. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K using a Rigaku 200 rotating anode X-ray generator and a MAR345 imaging plate detector. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using Denzo and Scalepack of the HKL2000 suite.33

Spectral characteristics, activity assay, and kinetic parameters

sAcOAT was cloned, overexpressed, and purified as described in the Materials and Methods section. The UV­ vis spectrum of the purified enzyme (Fig. 2) showed a peak at 413 nm indicating the presence of PLP bound to

the enzyme as an internal aldimine. Addition of AcOrn or Orn resulted in the disappearance of this peak and appearance of a new peak around 325 nm, probably due to the formation of PMP. Addition of a-ketoglutarate resulted in partial regeneration of the peak at 413 nm. The peaks at both the wavelengths were present and a steady state was reached within 30 min beyond which there was no change in the intensity of the peaks (Fig. 2). Activity of sAcOAT was estimated by the coupled assay as described in the Materials and Methods section. Activity was estimated at different pHs ranging from 7.0 to 10.5. The enzyme was most active at pH 9.5. At pH 8.0, the activity was reduced by 50%. The enzyme retained only 25% of its optimal activity in the presence of 200 mM NaCl at pH 8.0. Therefore, for further measurements, the purified enzyme was freed from salts by dialysis against 20 mM CAPSO pH 9.5. The activity was measured using AcOrn and Orn as substrates. The Km values for AcOrn and Orn were 0.037 (Æ0.008) mM and 0.64 (Æ0.005) mM, respectively, showing that AcOAT has seventeen-fold higher affinity for AcOrn. The kcat value was higher for AcOrn (1.55 (Æ0.4) s21) than Orn (0.82 (Æ0.09) s21). Comparison of kcat/Km values for AcOrn (41891.89 M21 s21) and Orn (1281.25 M21 s21) clearly shows that AcOrn is a better substrate of sAcOAT when compared to Orn. Comparison with the kinetic parameters of the E. coli enzyme reported by Ledwidge and Blanchard19 suggested that sAcOAT is more efficient than E. coli AcOAT. The values of Km and kcat are summarized in Table I.
Studies on Gcn inhibition

The spectrum was recorded before the addition of AcOrn (l), immediately after the addition of 0.1 mM AcOrn (~), and 30 min after the addition of AcOrn ($). This was followed by the addition of aketoglutarate and spectrum taken immediately (n) and after 30 min of incubation (!).

Gcn is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-AT and OAT.23,24 As these enzymes are homologous to sAcOAT, it was of interest to examine the effect of Gcn on sAcOAT. Incubation of sAcOAT with Gcn (0.03­1 mM) resulted in a rapid loss of enzyme activity. Nearly 50% of activity was lost within 2 min of incubation with 1 mM Gcn. A plot of ln (% remaining activity) against time showed that at lower concentrations of Gcn, the decay was linear but at higher concentrations it was hyperbolic (Fig. 3). These results suggest that there may be more than one intermediate during the inhibition of sAcOAT by Gcn. A secondDOI 10.1002/prot

The intensity of the peak around 340 nm had reduced drastically. This suggests that PLP-Gcn complex

order rate constant (0.32 mM21 s21) was obtained by plotting the pseudo first-order rate constants against concentration of Gcn (Fig. 3 inset). Only those pseudo firstorder rate constants for which the decay was linear were used for the calculation of the second-order rate constant. Addition of Gcn to sAcOAT resulted in the disappearance of the characteristic absorption peak at 413 nm and a concomitant appearance of a broad peak around 340 nm [Fig. 4(a) and inset]. The decrease in the absorbance at 413 nm was measured as a function of time after the addition of the ligand (0.05­0.6 mM). Pseudo first-order rate constants were determined from the slopes of the lines shown in Figure 4(b). A re-plot of these slopes versus concentration of Gcn gave a second-order rate constant of 0.16 mM21 s21 [Fig. 4(b) inset]. The second-order rate constants obtained by monitoring spectral changes and enzyme activity in the presence of Gcn are comparable and suggest that the rate of disappearance of internal aldimine and loss of enzyme activity are directly correlated. Figure 5 depicts the absorbance spectrum of sAcOAT obtained upon incubation of the enzyme with increasing concentrations of Gcn for 10 min. Ki (7 3 1026M) for Gcn inhibition of sAcOAT was obtained from the X-intercept of the plot of the reciprocal of the absorbance at 413 nm against Gcn concentration (Fig. 5 inset). The low value of Ki suggests that Gcn is a potent inhibitor of sAcOAT. The Ki obtained is comparable to that of GABAAT from Pseudomonas fluorescens (2.8 3 1026M) but slightly higher than that of GABA-AT from murine brain

chain density was observed in the final map were truncated to alanines. Ligand and water molecules were added during the last few cycles of refinement. The final model had an R and Rfree of 19.6% and 23.6%, respectively. Validation of the resulting structure using PROCHECK showed that 99.7% of the residues were in the allowed regions of Ramachandran plot. The refined structure of sAcOAT-GCN was used as the starting model to solve the structure sAcOAT-IA and sAcOAT-GLU. Statistics of refinement and quality of the structures are shown in Table III. The structure of sAcOAT-GLU was identical to that of sAcOAT-IA and no density was observed for the ligand. Similar observation has been reported for hOAT. The absence of density for Glu is probably due to reversible binding and low affinity.18,27 Therefore, only sAcOAT-IA was considered for further structural analysis.

had dissociated from the enzyme during washing. Further, addition of 10 lM of PLP increased the intensity of the peak at 413 nm showing that the enzyme could be reconstituted with PLP, at least partially (data not shown).

Structure determination and quality

sAcOAT was crystallized in the unliganded form (sAcOAT-IA) and in the presence of 1 mM Gcn (sAcOATGCN) or 10 mM glutamate (sAcOAT-GLU). The crystals belonged to the space group P21212 and had a dimer in ° the asymmetric unit with a Matthews coefficient of 2.0 A3 21 31 Da . Unit cell dimensions and data collection statistics for these crystals are shown in Table II. Comparison of the sequence of AcOAT with other members of the Type I subgroup II family of PLP-dependent enzymes indicates significant sequence identity and conservation of most of the critical residues (Fig. 6). hOAT, which shares a sequence identity of 33%, is a reasonable starting model for the determination of the structure of sAcOAT. The molecular replacement solution obtained for sAcOAT-GCN using AMoRe34 with hOAT as the phasing model had a correlation coefficient of 27% and R-factor of 53%. Although the correlation coefficient was low, there were no clashes between the two molecules placed by AMoRe or between symmetry-related molecules. The initial 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc maps showed reasonably good density for a significant fraction of the polypeptide. However, electron density for the C-terminal domain was poor and improved only after building the rest of the model. Iterative cycles of refinement and model building improved the quality of the electron density map, which was monitored by Rfree. Residues for which no clear side

sAcOAT polypeptide is 405 residues long and 40.4% of its residues form 15 a-helices and 18.9% form 18 bstrands. Figure 7 shows the topology of sAcOAT monomer. The monomer can be divided into three domains [Fig. 8(a)]; a small N-terminal domain (residues 1­60, green), a large PLP-binding domain (residues 61­303, orange), and a C-terminal domain (residues 304­405, blue). The N-terminal domain (Fig. 7) consists of two a-helices (aa and ab) and a b-sheet made of three antiparallel strands (ba-bc). Two residues 366­367 (bp) from the Cterminal domain also form part of this b-sheet. The large PLP-binding domain consists of an eight-stranded mixed b-sheet (bm, bd, bl, bk, bj, bg, be, bf) and ten a-helices including a 310 helix (ac-al). A two-stranded sheet of two residues each (195­196 (bh) and 202­203 (bi)) is also a part of this domain. The C-terminal domain consists of a

In the B­B dimer, steric clashes are between residue 278 of one subunit and residue 19 of the other subunit. Also symmetry-related contacts were calculated for A­A and B­B dimers and compared to those of A­B dimer. The three dimers have many distinct symmetry-related contacts and no steric clashes were observed between the symmetry related molecules. These observations suggest that of the three dimers, A­B dimer is the most favorable and the inherent asymmetry observed results from the incompatibility of identical conformations for the two subunits in the asymmetric unit and not due to crystal packing.

Differences between subunits A and B of sAcOAT-IA

Crystals of sAcOAT-IA were yellow in color indicating the presence of PLP. It was observed that the electron density corresponding to PLP covalently bound to NZ of K255 as an internal aldimine was better in subunit A compared to that in subunit B. The differences in the observed densities for PLP could be attributed to the conformational differences between the subunits, and in particular to the differences in the conformation of Lak-bm. In subunit B, this loop is close to the phosphate group of PLP bound to the A subunit. The phosphate forms at least two hydrogen bonds with T284 of loop Lak-bm (B-subunit) [Fig. 9(a)]. Since this loop of subunit A, which is close to the active site pocket of subunit B, is disordered, the active site pocket in the B subunit is more open leading to lower

In the subunit A of sAcOAT-IA, electron density is observed only from residue 12 and is poor up to residue 24. Also, in this subunit, residues 277­281 are disordered. In contrast, in subunit B, the chain is well ordered from residue 18. Unlike subunit A, residues 277­281 have significant electron density in subunit B. However, the observed electron density for this region is poorer when compared to the other regions of the subunit. The B-factors of atoms of this loop are higher. The main chain and CB atoms of all the residues in subunit A could be superposed on those of subunit B with an rms deviation of ° 0.15 A (for 1655 target pairs). Examination of the superposed subunits shows that they also differ at the loop connecting helix ak and strand bm (Lak-bm). In subunit A, residues 281­286 in Lak-bm are in a different conformation compared to those in subunit B. The N-terminus of subunit A and Lak-bm of subunit B are close to each other [Fig. 8(c)]. A branching of electron density starting from residue 287 (Lak-bm) in subunit B suggests that this loop could exist in two conformations. To provide a structural explanation for the asymmetry between the subunits [Fig. 8(c)], symmetrical A­A and B­ B dimers were generated. Calculation of inter subunit contacts shows that in the A­A dimer, residues 281­284 (part

affinity for PLP. It may therefore be concluded that there is a direct correlation between PLP-binding and the ordering of the loop Lak-bm and N-terminus. The active site pocket of sAcOAT comprises residues S107, G108, T109, N112, F141, H142, G143, E192, D226, V228, Q229, and K255 from one subunit and T284 from the neighboring ° subunit (residues within 4 A of PLP). The hydrogen-bonding interactions of PLP with the surrounding residues in sAcOAT are listed in Table V. The orientation of PLP in sAcOAT-IA is similar to that of the internal aldimine of hOAT.

Structural features of sAcOAT-GCN

sAcOAT-GCN dimer superposes with the sAcOAT-IA ° dimer with an rms deviation of 0.09 A (for 3253 target pairs). Subunits A and B of sAcOAT-GCN could be super° posed with an rms deviation of 0.14 A (for 1638 target pairs). The ordered electron density starts from residue 24 and 18 in the A and B subunits, respectively, of sAcOATGCN. As in sAcOAT-IA, the N-termini are in different conformations. However, the loop Lak-bm is equally disordered in both the subunits of sAcOAT-GCN. In subunit A, a reasonable electron density is observed at the position corresponding to PLP. However, there is no clear density for the inhibitor Gcn. Also the PLP does not exist in the internal aldimine form. Orientation of PLP in sAcOATGCN is slightly tilted ($78) when compared to that in sAcOAT-IA [Fig. 9(b)]. Similar but a larger change in orientation ($238) is observed in hOAT. Electron density for both PLP and Gcn are absent in the B subunit. The electron density observed for PLP and Gcn in hOAT is probably due to the ordered structure of Lak-bm and N-terminus in hOAT. S321 and T322 of hOAT promote PLP-binding by providing hydrogen-bonding interactions. Gcn has hydrogen-bonding interaction with Y55 in hOAT. The corresponding residue Y22 in sAcOAT is disordered. These observations as well as spectral studies suggest that PLPGcn complex has a low affinity for sAcOAT.

enzymes. The conformation of the loop Lak-bm in subunit B, however, is similar to those of hOAT and tAcOAT. In pOAT, the loop Lak-bm is in a more open conformation ° with a maximum displacement of 5 A from the corresponding CA atoms of sAcOAT. Interestingly, in pOAT, PLP is not bound, again emphasizing that the conformation of the loop Lak-bm and PLP-binding are correlated. The C-terminal domain of sAcOAT shows maximum differences from the corresponding domains of hOAT, pOAT, and tAcOAT. Two helices in the C-terminus of ° sAcOAT, am and ap, are displaced by as much as 3 A when compared to the corresponding helices in the other three enzymes. The whole C-terminal domain in sAcOAT is slightly shifted in a direction away from the PLP-binding domain when compared to hOAT. However, the superposition of C-terminal domain alone with that of hOAT shows similar differences suggesting that the differences observed are not due to domain motion. sAcOAT was also compared with the other members of the same family of enzymes (GABA-AT, 2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase with PDB entries 1SFF, 1D7U, and 2GSA, respectively). Superposition of CA atoms of sAcOAT with those of 1SFF, 1D7U, and 2GSA results in rms deviations of 1.25 (357 target pairs), 1.24 (for 357 target pairs), and 1.56 (for ° 345 target pairs) A and sequence alignment shows identities of 33, 27, and 23%, respectively.
Substrate specificity

Comparison of sAcOAT with other structural homologs

A structure-based sequence comparison using the program MUSTANG46 of sAcOAT, AcOAT from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (tAcOAT) (PDB entries 1VEF, 1WKG and 1WKH; Matsumura et al., unpublished data) hOAT, and OAT from Plasmodium yoelli (pOAT) (PDB entry 1Z7D; Walker et al., unpublished data) shows that the lysine forming Schiff base with PLP (marked by $) and most of the active site residues (marked by ~) are structurally conserved (Fig. 6). sAcOAT superposes with tAcOAT, hOAT, and pOAT with rms deviations of 1.13 (for 673 target pairs), 1.59 (for 722 target pairs), 1.90 (for 666 ° target pairs) A and shares sequence identities of 40.9, 33.4, and 31.2%, respectively. Of the three domains of sAcOAT, the large PLP-binding domain superposes well with corresponding domains of hOAT, pOAT, and tAcOAT. Compared to the other three enzymes, a large displacement of ° $4 A is observed in the loop connecting ac and ad in sAcOAT. The loop Lak-bm of subunit A of sAcOAT is different in conformation with respect to the other three

In most of the Type I subgroup II family of PLP-dependent enzymes, addition of substrate results in the formation of an external aldimine in which PLP is bound to the distal (side chain) amino group of the substrate in the first half of the reaction. In the second half of the reaction, an external aldimine with PLP bound to the a-amino group of the product (L-glutamate) is formed. Previous studies on the structure of hOAT27 have suggested that the formation of the two external aldimines is facilitated by small rearrangement of the side chain of a glutamate at the active site (E235 switch). Evidence for the E235 switch has been obtained by the elucidation of the structures of tAcOAT complexed with PPE (PLP-glutamate analog) and POI (PLP-AcOrn analog) (PDB entries 1WKH and 1WKG, respectively). In 1WKG, the side chain carboxyl group of E197, the residue corresponding to E235 of hOAT, has ionic interaction with R371. In 1WKH, the side chain carboxyl of E197 moves away from R371 and forms ionic interaction with the carboxyl group of PPE and R371. In sAcOAT, the residues corresponding to E197 and R371 of tAcOAT are E198 and R377, respectively. The conformations of these two residues in sAcOAT-IA are similar to those in tAcOAT internal aldimine. Therefore, a similar switch is expected to accommodate AcOrn and L-glutamate during the first and second half of the reactions in sAcOAT.

sAcOAT accepts both AcOrn and Orn as substrates although the affinity for AcOrn is higher. OAT accepts only Orn as the substrate. As a ligand-bound sAcOAT structure is not available, the structure of tAcOAT bound to POI (an analog of PLP-AcOrn) was used to identify ° probable residues interacting with AcOrn (<4 A). Residues likely to interact with the AcOrn are Y21, I51, F141, R144, E198, and K255 from subunit A and V80, G282, S283, and T284 from subunit B. Except three of these residues, all others are conserved in tAcOAT and hOAT. I51 of sAcOAT is substituted by a tyrosine in tAcOAT and hOAT,

V80 is substituted by threonine in tAcOAT and alanine in hOAT, and S283 is substituted by threonine in tAcOAT. However, examination of the conformation and environment of these residues suggests that these residues might not have a direct role in the higher specificity of AcOAT toward AcOrn. Another difference among the residues interacting with the acetyl group is the conformation of Y55 of hOAT. In sAcOAT and tAcOAT, the corresponding residues are Y21 and Y24, respectively. In sAcOAT, Y21 is disordered. However, in tAcOAT, Y24 is within hydrogenbonding distance to the acetyl group. The residue Y55 of

hOAT, in contrast, shows steric clash with the acetyl group. Therefore, the higher affinity of AcOrn to AcOAT may probably result from such minor conformational changes. However this needs to be further experimentally investigated. CONCLUSIONS The crystal structure of AcOAT from S. typhimurium is the first structure of acetylornithine aminotransferase from a mesophilic organism. Biochemical experiments with sAcOAT suggest that besides AcOrn the enzyme can also use Orn as a substrate, although with a lower affinity compared to AcOrn. Most of the catalytically important residues are conserved among the members of Type I subgroup II family of PLP-dependent enzymes suggesting that sAcOAT might follow a similar catalytic mechanism. Gabaculine is a potent inhibitor of sAcOAT. Spectral and structural studies show that PLP-Gcn complex has a low affinity for sAcOAT and the enzyme obtained after removal of the complex can be reconstituted by the addition of PLP. In the internal aldimine form of sAcOAT, the occupancy of PLP is higher in subunit A than in subunit B. This higher occupancy could be attributed to the ordered loop Lak-bm of subunit B, which is located close to the active site of subunit A. Comparison of the structure of sAcOAT with tAcOAT and hOAT suggests that the higher specificity of AcOAT toward AcOrn may not be due to specific residue changes in the active site of AcOAT and probably result from minor conformational changes in the active site residues. As the enzyme has a pivotal role in the cell wall biosynthesis, the results presented in this article could assist in the design of drugs against bacterial infections.
