The semi-synthetic insulins thus cbtained were found to be tmrmgeneous on high-performance liquid chromatography. Insulin binding studies:Humn cultured lymphcqtes (IM 9) were maintained in the madium RPMI 1640 with 10% foetal-calf serum and were used for binding studies when they were in the stationary phase. The mathods of insulin binding studies, as well as dissociation .js$.ydies were previou&ieg~;ee , t2~t2es Iodination of insulins:Porcine I -1abelled insulin, were prepared at a specific radioactivity of loo-150 uCi/pg by the method of Freychet et al (9).
