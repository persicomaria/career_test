The development of resistance to anti-retroviral drugs targeted against HIV is an increasing clinical problem in the treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals. Many patients develop drug-resistant strains of the virus after treatment with inhibitor cocktails (HAART therapy), which include multiple protease inhibitors. Therefore, it is imperative that we understand the mechanisms by which the viral proteins, in particular HIV-1 protease, develop resistance. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of HIV-1 protease NL4-3 in complex with the potent protease inhibitor TL-3 at ° 2.0 A resolution. We have also obtained the crystal structures of three mutant forms of NL4-3 protease containing one (V82A), three (V82A, M46I, F53L) and six (V82A, M46I, F53L, V77I, L24I, L63P) point mutations in complex with TL-3. The three protease mutants arose sequentially under ex vivo selective pressure in the presence of TL-3, and exhibit fourfold, 11-fold, and 30-fold resistance to TL-3, respectively. This series of protease crystal structures offers insights into the biochemical and structural mechanisms by which the enzyme can overcome inhibition by TL-3 while recovering some of its native catalytic activity.

Introduction
Inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease have been a critical component of anti-HIV drug cocktails (known as HAART therapy) for several years.1 The ability of protease inhibitors, in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, to suppress viral replication has greatly improved the clinical outcome for HIV-infected individuals.2,3 The emergence of viral strains that are resistant to currently used protease inhibitors has increased the need to develop new, more potent inhibitors of HIV-1 protease to combat these highly resistant strains.4,5 Our ability to understand the evolution of protease

resistance at a structural level is an essential aspect of developing such an inhibitor. TL-3 was designed as a C2 symmetric, broad-based HIV protease inhibitor A potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease, TL-3, was previously developed using structure-aided drug design and combinatorial chemistry. When the binding sites of FIV protease and several drugresistant forms of HIV-1 protease enzymes were compared, a preference for small hydrophobic residues at the P3 and P3 0 subsites was noted.6 It was also discovered through combinatorial screening that large, aromatic groups at the P1 and P1 0 subsites acted cooperatively with the small hydrophobic groups at the P3 and P3 0 subsites to improve binding of inhibitors.7 TL-3 is a C2 symmetric compound with a (1S,2R,3R,4S)-1,4-diamino-1,4dibenzyl-2,3-butanediol core (P1 and P1 0 residues); valine as P2 and P2 0 residues; alanine as P3 and P3 0 residues; and a carboxy-benzyl moiety at the P4 and P4 0 positions. TL-3 is a broad-based inhibitor and has nanomolar potency against wild-type and

968 drug-resistant forms of HIV-1 protease, FIV protease and SIV protease.6­8 Ex vivo evolution of TL-3 resistance in the HIV-1 protease variant NL4-3 When TL-3 was tested against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates from patients resistant to commercially available protease inhibitors, it was found to inhibit nine out of the 13 drug-resistant strains evaluated.8 To investigate changes in protease associated with TL-3 resistance and protease function, the isolate, R8, was cultured ex vivo in MT-2 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of TL-3.8 As the concentration of the inhibitor was increased, TL-3-resistant strains of HIV-1 emerged. The TL-3-resistant strains were isolated, their protease genes were sequenced, cloned, expressed, and tested for both TL-3 binding and substrate cleavage activity. Three sequential HIV-1 protease mutants arose during the viral evolution of TL-3 resistance: a 1X mutant containing the common V82A mutation; a 3X mutant with the same V82A and two additional mutations, M46I and F53L; and a 6X mutant, containing the same three mutations observed previously, as well as L24I, L63P and V77I mutations. These mutations gave rise to an incremental increase in the IC50 for TL-3 from 6 nM against the wild-type NL4-3 protease to 183 nM against the 6X mutant HIV-1 protease (a 30-fold increase).8 Furthermore, the resulting 6X mutant was cross-resistant to the clinical protease inhibitors Nelfinavir, Saquinavir and Ritonavir with eight, nine and 14-fold increases in the IC50, respectively, as compared to earlier protease mutants. For all three mutants, the Km for peptide substrate increased, but for the 3X and 6X mutants the kcat for peptide substrate also increased. This resulted in a recovery of 47% and 60% of the wild-type catalytic efficiency for 3X and 6X, respectively.8 Thus, the selective pressure on the virus of individual protease inhibitors may be operating through general mechanisms to evolve resistance while maintaining enzyme efficacy. We have determined the three-dimensional crystal structures of wild-type NL4-3 protease, as well as three drug-resistant mutants in complex with TL-3. These protease crystal structures offer insights into the sequentially acquired structural changes and mechanisms by which the protease can overcome inhibition by TL-3 while recovering some of its normal catalytic activity.

complex with TL-3. The wild-type protease-TL3 complex crystallized in the space group P6122 with a monomer in the asymmetric unit and the C2 axis of the protease dimer and TL-3 coincident with a crystallographic 2-fold (Table 1). Consequently, the structure of the complex is an average of the two half-sites. The SigmaA-weighted9 jFojKjFcj difference density contoured at 2s in the active site was unambiguous (see Supplementary Data) and showed no indication of differing conformations for the inhibitor in the two half-sites. The inhibitor, TL-3, was bound in the active site of the wild-type protease with its C2 axis of symmetry coincident with the crystallographic 2-fold and, therefore, was modeled as one half of the C2 symmetric compound. TL-3 forms an intricate network of hydrogen bonds with residues in the catalytic loop and flap region of the NL4-3 protease (Table 2; Figure 1). Six central water molecules and one coincident on the C2 axis mediate this hydrogen bonding network. The majority of the direct protein­inhibitor interactions are hydrogen bonds formed between mainchain atoms. Only four of the 32 hydrogen bonds formed between TL-3 and the wild-type protease involve side-chain atoms of the protease: two formed between the P1 oxygen atom of TL-3 and Asp25 Od2 and another two formed between the P3 nitrogen atom of TL-3 and Asp29 Od1 (Table 2, Figure 1). Two pairs of hydrogen bonds between the P4 oxygen atom and Gly48 N, and P2 nitrogen and Gly48 O (Table 2, Figure 1), play a critical role in bridging the symmetric inhibitor to the flap regions of the protease. A water molecule located between the tips of the flaps and the bound inhibitor (W4 in Figure 1, commonly referred to as the flap water) forms four hydrogen bonds bridging the flaps to each other and the inhibitor. The P1 0 phenyl ring of TL-3 is tightly packed against the side-chains of Pro81 and Val82 of the 2-fold related monomer (Figure 2(a)). The sidechain of Val82 adopts two conformations, both of which pack against the P1 0 phenyl ring of TL-3. The side-chain of Phe53 (located in the flap region of the protease) also adopts two conformations in this structure, each of which forms van der Waals contacts. In one conformation, the side-chain of Phe53 is positioned to form a packing contact with the side-chain of Met46 (Figure 2(b)). In the other conformation, the side-chain of Phe53 forms a weak packing interaction with the phenyl ring of the P4 carboxy-benzyl group of TL-3. Mutation of Val82 to Ala weakens a critical packing interaction The 1X protease mutant contains a single Val82 to Ala mutation relative to the wild-type NL4-3 protease. The 1X protease in complex with TL-3 also crystallized in the space group P6122 with a monomer in the asymmetric unit and the C2 axis of the dimer coincident on a crystallographic 2-fold (Table 1). Moreover, when the structures of

wild-type and 1X protease are superimposed the main-chain atoms overlay very well with an r.m.s.d. ° of 0.32 A. However, when the conformations of the bound TL-3 for wild-type and 1X are compared, there are significant differences at the P1/P1 0 subsites (Figure 2(a)). In the wild-type structure, the phenyl ring at the P1 0 position of TL-3 packs tightly against the side-chains of Pro81 and Val82 in the 2-fold related monomer. Mutation of residue 82 to an alanine in the 1X protease results in the loss of the valine Cg1 and Cg2 atoms at this position and weakens the packing contact with the P1 0 phenyl ring of TL-3. The P1 0 phenyl ring shifts away from ° the side-chain of Pro81 by 0.8 A and rotates by w258 about its c1 torsion angle (Figure 2(a)). The sidechain of Pro81 isomerizes so that the ring is puckered away from the P1 0 phenyl ring. Loosening of the packing environment of the P1 0 phenyl group increases the IC50 for TL-3 by a factor of 4 (6 nM to 22 nM).

In contrast to the changes in packing at the P1/P1 0 subsites, other packing contacts involving TL-3 remain unchanged in the 1X structure. In addition, the detailed hydrogen bonding network involving the inhibitor and the catalytic loop and flap regions of the protease remains essentially identical with that observed in the wild-type structure (Table 2, Figure 1). The mutations in 3X protease increase flap mobility Two flap residues are mutated in the 3X protease; Met46 is replaced by an Ile and Phe53 is replaced by a Leu. These mutations appear to result in a greater flexibility of the flap regions. In spite of these additional mutations, 3X protease again crystallized in the space group P6122 with a monomer in the asymmetric unit and the C2 axis of the dimer coincident with the crystallographic 2-fold (Table 1).

Figure 1. Conformation of HIV-1 protease NL4-3 in complex with the inhibitor TL-3. TL-3 forms an intricate hydrogen bonding network with wild-type NL4-3 protease. The network between TL-3 and residues in the catalytic loop and flap regions is mediated by seven ordered water molecules (W1­W4, W1 0 ­W3 0 ). The majority of the protein­inhibitor hydrogen bonds are formed between main-chain atoms. See Table 2 for hydrogen bond distances. The positions of Met46 and Phe53 are indicated in parentheses.

Figure 2. Effects of the 1X and 3X mutants on interactions with TL-3. (a) Conformational changes observed at the P1/ P1 0 position of TL-3 in the 1X mutant protease. Comparisons of the TL-3 complexes with wild-type protease (grey) and 1X protease (yellow) reveals conformational changes at the P1/P1 0 position of the inhibitor. The mutation of residue 82 from valine to alanine in the 1X mutant protease weakens the packing contact formed with the P1/P1 0 position of TL-3, ° allowing the P1/P1 0 phenyl ring to shift away from the side-chain of Pro81 by 0.8 A and rotate by 258 about the c1 torsion angle. (b) Residues in the flap region of protease form stabilizing contacts. The side-chain of Phe53 adopts two conformations in wild-type and 1X proteases. In one conformation it forms a van der Waals interaction with the sidechain of Met46. In the other conformation it forms a hydrophobic contact with the P4 phenyl ring of TL-3. The side-chain of Met46 is packed between the side-chains of Phe53 and Lys55 in the wild-type and 1X structures. In the 3X mutant protease residue 46 is mutated to an Ile and residue 53 is mutated to a Leu (indicated in parentheses). Loss of the stabilizing contacts due to these mutations increases the overall mobility of the flaps (see Figure 3(a)) and alters the water structure near the tips of the flaps (see Table 2). The positions of Ile50, Gly51 and Gly52 are indicated.

In the wild-type and 1X structures, the side-chain of Met46 forms a pair of packing contacts with the side-chains of Phe53 and Lys55; and the alternate conformation of Phe53 forms a packing contact with P4 phenyl group of TL-3 (Figure 2(b)). In the case of the 3X protease, examination of the 2jFojKjFcj and jFojKjFcj electron density maps indicates that residues Gly52 and Leu53, which are located at the tip of the flap and normally involved in making intra-flap and inter-flap contacts, are disordered. Hence, the interaction between the side-chains of flap residues 46 and 53 and the hydrophobic contact formed between residue 53 and the P4 phenyl ring of TL-3, are lost in the 3X structure. Additionally, the side-chains of residues 46 and 55 are at a distance too far to form a packing contact. Comparison of the temperature factors of the 1X and 3X protease (Figure 3(a)) shows that the 3X flap regions exhibit a higher degree of thermal motion. Loss of these inter-flap, intra-flap and flap­inhibitor contacts, and the associated increase in the mobility of the flap regions, further increases the IC50 for TL-3 from 22 nM for 1X protease to 64 nM for 3X protease (a wthreefold increase relative to 1X and overall 11-fold increase compared to wild-type protease). The water structure near the bound inhibitor has also rearranged in the 3X structure. Most notably, the water molecule that bridges the flaps to the P1 and P1 0 sites of TL-3 (W4 in Figure 1, Table 2) is no longer visible. Instead, there is a water molecule between the two flaps bridging the main-chain atoms of Gly49, Ile50 and Gly51 0 (Water 5 in

Table 2). An additional water molecule near the P1 and P3 positions of TL-3 also forms hydrogen bonds with Gly27 O, P1 N and P3 O (Water 6 in Table 2). The loss of the flap-bridging water molecule has been previously observed to be associated with changes in the flap conformation.10 Aside from the differences in the flap regions, the remainder of the 3X structure superimposes well onto the 1X ° structure with an r.m.s.d. of 0.32 A. Both protein and inhibitor exhibit conformational asymmetry in the 6X-TL-3 structure The 6X protease­TL-3 complex crystallized in the space group I4122 with a dimer in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). Unlike the previous structures, TL-3 was not constrained by the 2-fold axis of symmetry in the active site of the 6X protease. jFojKjFcj difference density maps showed that the bound TL-3 is distinctly asymmetric (see Supplementary Data). In one half of the active site, TL-3 adopts a conformation very similar to that observed in the wild-type, 1X and 3X structures and the watermediated hydrogen bonding network is relatively unaffected by the mutations (denoted as 6Xa in Table 2, Figure 4). However, in the other half of the active site, the peptide bond between the P3b Ala and the P4b carboxy-benzyl of TL-3 is flipped and the P3b Ala is rotated 1458 relative to the conformation observed in the wild-type, 1X and 3X proteases (denoted as 6Xb in Table 2, Figure 4). The P3b-P4b peptide bond flip and rotation of the P3b residue shifts this segment of the inhibitor up to

B-factors in the flap region (indicated by brackets) of 3X protease (blue), which contains the M46I ° and F53L flap mutations, are 10­20 A2 higher than Bfactors in the flap region of 1X protease (purple).

in 6Xb and this half of the dimer lacks two of the hydrogen bonds that W1b would have made to TL-3 (Table 2). The adjacent water molecule is still present (W2b in Figure 4) and forms compensatory hydrogen bonds with Gly27 O and Asp29 Od1, but with significantly longer hydrogen bonding distances (Table 2). In total, the rearrangement of TL-3 into the flipped conformation results in a net loss of seven hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric conformations in the two halves of the 6X protease dimer are apparent when superimposed about the pseudo 2-fold axis of the dimer. In the protease monomer which binds TL-3 in a flipped conformation (6Xb), the flap region has ° moved 3.0 A away from the active site relative to the other half of the dimer. Comparison of the temperature factors of the two monomers of the 6X protease structure (Figure 3(b)) reveals that the region N-terminal to the flaps of the flipped monomer (6Xb) is markedly more flexible than the same region of the non-flipped monomer (6Xa). Consequently, the asymmetry observed in the TL-3 conformation is mirrored in the 6X protease conformation, consistent with the new crystal form observed for the complex. At the same time the 6Xa monomer also adopts a conformation distinct from that observed in the wild-type, 1X and 3X structures. The dimer interface is augmented by the Leu24Ile mutation in 6X protease The dimer interface of HIV-1 protease, outside the flap regions, is formed by residues in the N and C-terminal regions, and residues in the catalytic loops near Asp25. In the 6X protease mutant, the dimer interface gains two packing contacts between the side-chain of Ile24 and the side-chains of Leu90 and Leu97 0 . In the wild-type, 1X and 3X proteases, the Cd2 side-chain atom of Leu24 is packed against the side-chains of Val11, Ile66 and Leu90 within the monomer (Figure 5). Mutation of Leu24 to Ile in the 6X protease rearranges the side-chain carbon atoms so that the Cd1 side-chain atom of Leu24 is lost, replaced by the Cg2 atom of Ile24, which is now packed between Leu90 and Leu97 0 across the dimer interface (Figure 5). Hence, the side-chain of Ile24 in the 6X protease retains the three packing contacts made between residue 24 and Val11, Ile66 and Leu90 observed in the wild-type, 1X and 3X proteases, while creating an additional packing contact across the dimer interface. Reinforcement of the dimer interface by the addition of this packing contact could help compensate for the destabilization of the flap regions caused by the M46I and F53L mutations present in the 3X mutant and the L63P mutation in the 6X mutant (below). The surface packing arrangement is altered by the Leu63Pro mutation in 6X protease An important feature of the 6X mutant is that none of the three additional mutations (L24I, L63P,

° 6 A toward the flaps of the protease (Figure 4). In the "flipped" conformation, the P4b phenyl ring of TL-3 packs against the P1b phenyl ring and Gly48b in the flap. The P1b phenyl ring of TL-3 has also shifted towards the flap region and now forms a packing contact with Gly49b. The flipping of the P3b­P4b peptide bond and rotation of the Ala P3b also results in the loss of the hydrogen bond made between the P4b carbonyl oxygen (P4b O1) and Gly48b N. Hence, a critical interaction between the flap region of the protease and TL-3 in wild-type protease (Figure 1) is lost in the 6Xb site of the 6X mutant. Higher than average temperature factors observed for the P4b phenyl ° ring (65 A2), suggest that the inhibitor­protein interaction at the P4b position of the flipped monomer (6Xb) is weakened and the conformation adopted allows for a higher degree of movement in the inhibitor (Figure 4). A key water molecule of the hydrogen bonding network (W1b) is not visible

Figure 4. Comparison of the conformation of TL-3 bound to wild-type and 6X mutant protease. TL-3 adopts a distinctly asymmetric conformation when bound to 6X protease (green). In one half of the 6X dimer, TL-3 adopts a conformation similar to that observed in the wild-type (grey), 1X and 3X complexes (denoted as 6Xa). In the other half of the 6X dimer, the P3b­P4b region of TL-3 has rearranged substantially (denoted as 6Xb). In 6Xb, the peptide bond between ° P3b and P4b has flipped, and Ala P3b has rotated, shifting the P4b carboxy-benzyl moiety of TL-3 toward the flaps by 6 A (*). In the flipped conformation, the P4b phenyl ring forms packing contacts with the P1b phenyl ring and the main-chain carbon atoms of Gly48b. The conformational changes observed in 6Xb affect the hydrogen bonding network (compare to Figure 1). The central water molecule (W1b) is lost as well as the interactions between TL-3, W3band Gly48b. These changes result in the net loss of seven hydrogen bonds relative to wild-type protease (see Table 2). The locations of residues mutated in 6X protease, Ile24, Pro63 and Ile77, are indicated in red text.

and V77I) involves residues in the flaps. The Leu63Pro mutation found in the 6X protease is localized to the periphery of the enzyme, near the base of the flaps (Figure 4). The surface of the 3X protease near residue 63 is relatively flat. In the 6X protease, the surface of the protease near Pro63 has become pocketed. In the protease monomer that binds TL-3 in the non-flipped conformation (6Xa), Pro63 forms a deep pocket in cooperation with atoms from adjacent residues 14­16, 64, 65, 70 and 71. This pocket has a solvent-exposed surface ° ° area of 47 A2 and a volume of 23 A3.2,11 The ° solvent-exposed surface area of Pro63 (22 A2) is almost twice that of the corresponding residue, ° Leu63, in the 3X structure (12 A2). In contrast, the protease monomer that binds TL-3 in the flipped conformation (6Xb) has a shallow pocket near Pro63 ° with solvent-exposed surface area of only 15 A2. Consequently, the change in the protein surface in the 6Xb monomer relative to 3X is subtle. In other words, the L63P mutation alters the enzyme surface in the 6Xa monomer, but the 6Xb monomer remains

more like wild-type in this region. Thus, the alteration of exposed protein surface near Pro63 is another manifestation of asymmetry of 6Xa relative to 6Xb. The Val77Ile mutation in 6X protease alters packing arrangements near the P1b phenyl ring of TL-3 As noted above, the mutations representing the 6X versus the 3X proteases are distal from the flap regions. To understand their effect on the structure, we have employed difference distance matrices to depict how these changes translate to changes in the TL-3 binding site (see Materials and Methods). Residue 77, which is positioned at the beginning of the P1 loop containing both Pro81 and Ala82 (Figure 4), is mutated from valine to isoleucine in the 6X protease. Difference distance matrices calculated between the 3X and 6X structures reveal that the P1 loop residues 77 to 82 in the non-flipped monomer of the 6X structure (6Xa) have shifted

Figure 5. Packing changes at the dimeric interface of the 6X mutant protease due to the Leu24Ile mutation. Mutation of residue 24 from a Leu in the wild-type protease (grey) to an Ile in the 6X protease (green) creates a new packing contact across the dimer interface. In the wild-type protease, the Cd2 methyl group of Leu24 is in contact with the side-chains of Val11, Leu66 and Leu90 (indicated as grey arrows). In the 6X protease, the mutation of residue 24 to Ile rearranges the side-chain atoms so that the three packing contacts made by the sidechain of Leu24 in the wild-type protease are preserved and two additional packing contacts are made with the side-chains of Leu90 and the 2-fold related Leu97 0 (indicated as green arrows).

protease, analysis reveals that these mutations, while having more subtle structural effects, substantially affect the TL-3 binding site. The mutation of Leu63 to Pro unequally increases the exposed hydrophobic surface area at the base of the flaps, augmenting the asymmetry of their environment. The mutation of Leu24 to Ile creates a new packing contact across the dimer interface. Reinforcement of the dimer interface by the formation of this new contact may compensate for the flap-destabilizing mutations seen in 3X (M46I, F53L) and 6X (L63P) protease. The Val77 to Ile mutation restores the packing contact lost due to the 1X mutation between Pro81a, Ala 82a and the P1b site of TL-3 in one half of the 6X structure. In concert, these mutations give rise to a distinctly asymmetric interaction of the 6Xa/6Xb protease with TL-3.

Discussion
The 1X and 3X protease mutations result in the loss of inhibitor­protein contacts and an increase in flap mobility We have described crystal structures of NL4-3 protease and protease mutants of HIV-1 that arose sequentially during tissue culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of TL-3. If we consider the evolution of resistance to TL-3 in NL4-3 protease as a series of discrete structural steps along a pathway, the first step decreases the efficacy of the inhibitor by weakening or removing multiple packing contacts. The first mutation to arise in response to treatment with TL-3 was Val82 to Ala. This removes two methyl groups from the side-chain of residue 82. These two methyl groups form packing contacts between the P1 0 phenyl ring of TL-3 and residues 81 and 82 of the 2-fold related monomer in the wildtype protease (Figure 2(a)). Removal of these contacts in the 1X protease increases the IC50 for TL-3 by a factor of 4 (ICWT Z 6 nM; IC1X Z 22 nM).8 50 50 The V82A mutation is the most common mutation to arise in response to treatment of HIV with commercially available protease inhibitors, especially in patients receiving Indinavir or Ritonavir.14 Examination of the complexes of wildtype HIV protease and these inhibitors revealed that Val82 forms van der Waals interactions with six or more atoms of the inhibitor.15­18 The loss of these interactions due to the mutation of Val82 to Ala results in significant reduction in the inhibition of the mutant proteases by these inhibitors, in the same manner observed for the TL-3/V82A complex reported here.12,19­22 In most of the previously reported V82A mutant/inhibitor complexes, structural rearrangements also resulted in the loss of protein­inhibitor hydrogen bonds.19 Unlike these inhibitor/V82A mutant structures, the hydrogen bonding network of the V82A protease complexed with TL-3 was unchanged by the mutation. This difference may be due to the ability of TL-3 to adopt an extended, substrate-like conformation in the

toward the active site of the flipped monomer (6Xb) ° by distances of up to 2 A (Figure 6). This movement packs the side-chain of Pro81 in the non-flipped monomer against the P1b phenyl ring in the flipped half of TL-3. The bulkier Ile side-chain at residue 77 packing against the buried side-chain of Leu38 promotes this loop rearrangement. In the wild-type protease structure, the side-chain of Pro81 forms a tight packing contact with the P1 0 phenyl ring of TL-3 (Figure 2(a)). The mutation of Val82 to Ala in the 1X protease weakens this contact and allows the P1 0 phenyl ring of TL-3 to move ° away from the side-chain of Pro81 by w1 A. As discussed earlier, this movement, along with a rotation of the P1 0 phenyl group, creates a gap between the P1 0 site of the inhibitor and the loop containing Pro81 and Ala82 in the twofold related protease monomer of 1X protease (Figure 2(a)). However, in the 6X mutant, the loop movement facilitated by the V77I mutation closes this gap in one half of the active site, restoring the contact observed in the wild-type. The restoration of the packing contacts lost due to the common V82A mutation have been previously observed to result from movements of the P1 loop toward the bound inhibitor.12,13 The 6X versus 3X mutations affect TL-3 binding by three distinct mechanisms While the mutations that appear in the 6X protease are all distal to the flap regions of the

Figure 6. Difference distance matrix comparing 3X and 6X proteases in complex with TL-3. The residue to residue distances (rrd) of the symmetrical 3X protease dimer have been subtracted from the rrd of the asymmetrical 6X protease dimer (see Materials and Methods for a detailed explanation of how this plot was generated). The color scale on the right indicates the magnitude of the difference. Note that in the non-flipped monomer of 6X protease (6Xa), the region between ° residues 77 and 82 (boxed area) has shifted by up to 2 A towards the flipped monomer (6Xb) as indicated by the dark red bars in the bottom left-hand portion of the plot. This movement reforms the packing contact between P1b and residues 81a and 82a in the 6X­TL-3 complex (*) that was lost in the 1X­TL-3 complex. This plot also reveals complex, asymmetric and more subtle rearrangements in the 6Xa/6Xb dimer compared to the symmetric 3X dimer. The difference distance matrices were calculated with software developed by the authors written in the open source object-oriented programming language, Python (Python Software Foundation, Ipswich, MA), and PIL, the Python Imaging Library ¨ (Secret Labs AB, Linkoping, Sweden). Where the alpha-carbon atom could not be identified due to disordered electron density, no distances could be calculated. These regions are indicated by grey bars.

protease active site in comparison to the shorter, more compact conformations adopted by the commercially available protease inhibitors. It has been shown prior to this work that the hydrogen bonding network formed between substrate peptides and the protease active site remains relatively unaffected by the V82A mutation.19 In a few of the inhibitor/V82A mutant complex structures, the packing contact between the P1 site of the inhibitor and the binding pocket containing residue 82 is restored by main-chain movements in the P1 loop, which contains residues 78­83. The V82A mutant of HIV-1 protease in complex with the inhibitor A-77003, which is closely related to TL-3, crystallized in the space group P212121 with a dimer in the asymmetric unit.12 In this complex, the mutation of Val82 to Ala resulted in the loss of packing interactions between the P1 0 phenyl group of A-77003 and the binding pocket containing

residue 82 in the same manner observed in the V82A mutant (1X) complexed with TL-3. However, in the other half of the active site, movement of main-chain atoms of residues 81 0 ­84 0 toward the inhibitor and slight changes in the position of the P1 phenyl ring of A-77003 maintained this packing contact. The V82A mutant of HIV-1 protease in complex with the inhibitor UIC-94017, a derivative of Amprenavir, also crystallized in the space group P212121 with a dimer in the asymmetric unit.23 In this instance, shifts in the main chain near residues 81/81 0 and 82/82 0 acted to maintain the packing contact at both the half sites. As a result, the reduction in inhibitor binding of UIC-94017 due to the V82A mutation was relatively small when compared to that of TL-3.23 In the case of the V82A mutant protease and TL-3, compensatory structural changes are not observed, consistent with the wfourfold increase in the IC50 for TL-3.8

976 It is interesting to note that these contacts are restored by movement of the P1 loop in one half of the 6X structure (Figure 6). The second step along the pathway toward resistance involves two additional mutations, Met46 to Ile and Phe53 to Leu, both localized to the flap region of the protease. The loss of contacts between the side-chains of the three flap residues, 46, 53 and Lys55 (Figure 2(b)), and between residue 53 and the P4 phenyl ring of TL-3, increases the overall mobility of the flaps as indicated by the increased thermal motion (Figure 3(a)). As discussed, two residues in the flap region, Gly52 and Leu53, also become disordered in the 3X protease structure. These residues are located at the tips of the flaps and are normally involved in making intra-flap and inter-flap contacts. Further, the flapbridging water molecule (W4 in Figure 1) is not visible in the 3X structure, another indication of an increased conformational flexibility in the flaps. The packing of the flaps has been previously demonstrated to be crucial in substrate binding and drug resistance.10,24­26 The loss of packing contacts and increased mobility of the flaps would reduce the enthalpic component of TL-3 binding, consistent with the observed increase in the IC50 for TL-3 by an additional factor of w3 (IC1X Z 22 nM; 50 IC3X Z 64 nM).8 50 In addition to increasing the IC50 for TL-3, the flap mutations in the 3X mutant resulted in the recovery of some catalytic activity of the enzyme by increasing k cat . The 1X protease has a 1X Km Z 73:5 mM and k1X Z 1:74 sK1 for substrate cat 1X peptide.8 The overall catalytic efficiency ðk1X =Km Þ cat K1 K1 for 1X protease is 0.024 s mM , which is a 60% reduction relative to wild-type NL4-3 WT ðkWT =Km Z 0:060 sK1 mMK1 Þ. The Km for the subcat strate peptide of 3X protease has further increased 3X relative to 1X protease ðKm Z 194:2 mMÞ, but the kcat has increased with respect to both wild-type and 1X protease ðk3X Z 5:45 sK1 Þ, improving the overall cat catalytic efficiency of 3X protease by 7% relative 3X to 1X protease ðk3X =Km Z 0:028 sK1 mMK1 Þ. The cat addition of the M46I mutation to other drugresistant mutants of HIV protease has been observed to result in the compensatory recovery of the catalytic activity of the protease.21,27 The increased mobility of the flaps in the 3X mutant reduces affinity for TL-3 and concomitantly, the Km for substrate also increases to a similar extent (2.6fold versus threefold). However, this flexibility also enhances kcat, possibly by affecting the rate of product release. In other words, the 3X mutant binds TL-3 less well while regaining some wildtype enzyme activity. Evolution of resistance in 6X protease induces conformational asymmetry to restore wild-typelike activity The most striking effect of the mutations in the 6X protease is the appearance of conformational asymmetry. This asymmetry is present in both

Mechanisms of Drug Resistance in HIV-1 Protease

the inhibitor and the protease. The inhibitor, TL-3, adopts a more compact conformation in one half of the active site of the 6X protease and has shifted ° toward the flap region by 6 A (6Xb in Figure 4). In ° addition, the 6Xb flap region has shifted by 3 A away from bound TL-3 relative to the other half of the active site (Figure 4). In contrast, the conformation of bound TL-3 and the flap region in the 6Xa monomer closely resembles that observed in the previous structures. The 6Xb monomer is not involved in crystal packing contacts in the region of the flipped conformation of TL-3. Although the 3X protease crystallized under very different conditions (PEG 4000, basic pH, see Materials and Methods) than the three other proteases (ammonium sulfate, acidic pH, see Materials and Methods), it crystallized in the same space group (P6122) as the wild-type and 1X proteases. The wildtype, 1X and 3X proteases all formed crystals that contained a monomer in the asymmetric unit and with similar crystal packing contacts. In contrast, the 6X protease crystallized under similar conditions to the wild-type and 1X proteases (with the addition of sodium thiocyanate), but in a completely different space group (I4122) than the other three proteases and with a dimer in the asymmetric unit. This suggests that because the conformation of the 6X ­ TL-3 complex is substantially different it gives rise to a different crystal lattice. The Km for substrate peptide decreases slightly in 6X the 6X protease ðKm Z 187:2 mMÞ relative to 3X; and at the same time the kcat increases substantially ðk6X Z 6:68 sK1 Þ; as a result, the 6X protease recovers cat 62% of the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type 6X enzyme ðk6X =Km Z 0:037 sK1 mMK1 Þ.8 Native subcat strates of HIV-1 protease are necessarily asymmetric polypeptides. Previous work by Schiffer and co-workers demonstrated that the binding of native substrates to the HIV-1 protease homodimer results in asymmetry, and that the ability to bind asymmetric substrates was essential for the specific molecular recognition.19,28 They also noted the importance of substrate/enzyme shape complementarity in the specific recognition of substrates. By overlaying the structures of the substrate/ enzyme complexes, they defined a substratebinding envelope that was distinctly non-C 2 symmetric. Interactions between the P1 and P3 sites in one half of the active site created a toriod shape in the binding envelope while the other half had an extended shape. The conformation of TL-3 in the 6X protease structure is remarkably similar to the asymmetric substrate-binding envelope defined by Schiffer et al.19,28 In the flipped half of the 6X binding site, the interactions between the P1b phenyl ring and the P4b carboxy-benzyl group mimic the toriod shape formed by the P1/P3 interactions in the substrate complexes. In the nonflipped half of the 6X binding site, TL-3 adopts an extended conformation identical with the extended half of the peptide substrate envelope. The peptide substrate complexes also exhibited flap movements similar to those seen in 6X protease.28 The ability of

a portion of the Pol gene of the BH10 clone of HIV was used for amplification of sequence encoding protease. The 5 0 primer was constructed so as to insert an initiator methionine as part of the coding sequence for an NdeI site, eight amino acid residues before the beginning of protease. This primer also encoded a Q7K mutation to block a major site of autoproteolysis.32 The 3 0 primer was designed to insert a stop codon immediately after residue 99 of protease, and a HindIII site of the 3 0 stop codon, to facilitate directional cloning. The PCR product was then cut with NdeI and HindIII and inserted into the pET 21aC vector (Novagen) for protein expression. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into the BL21.DE3, pLys S strain of Escherichia coli.33 When the cells reached an A600 nmZ0.8­1.0, expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG. The cells were then grown for 4 h to overnight at 37 8C, depending on which construct was being expressed. Purification and refolding Inclusion bodies containing wild-type, 3X or 6X protease were purified by resuspending the cell pellet from 1 l of cell culture in 20 ml of NP-40 (USB) and stirring for 20 min at room temperature. The solution was then treated in a Waring blender for 30 min. Inclusion bodies were pelleted at 8000g for 1 h and subsequently washed with deionized water until the pelleted inclusion bodies stuck to the side of the centrifuge tube (typically after the third wash). Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 8 M urea, 10 mM DTT with gentle rocking overnight at 4 8C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, followed by filtration through a 0.45 mm membrane. Solid DE52 (Whatman; 20 g) was then added and the solution was incubated at 4 8C for 1 h and then filtered through a 0.45 mm membrane. The DE52 was discarded and the filtered solution containing protease was then applied to an RQ column (J. T. Baker) that had been equilibrated in 8 M urea, 10 mM DTT. The column flow-through containing the protease was collected and refolded by dialysis against 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 25 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol overnight at 4 8C, followed by dialysis against 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol for 3 h. The refolded protease was centrifuged for 20 min at 38,000g at 4 8C to remove any precipitated material. The sample was then concentrated using a centrifuge concentrator (Amicon Ultra 10,000 MWCO), typically to 5­10 mg/ml. The 1X mutant protease was purified as described34 with minor modifications. Inclusion bodies were prepared by resuspending the cell pellet from 1 l of cell culture medium in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 25 mM NaCl, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol). The resuspended cells were lysed by passing through a 1 inch. diameter French Press at 20,000 psi twice. The inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation at 4 8C for 20 min at 38,000g (fixed angle rotor). The inclusion bodies were washed by resuspension in the following buffers (in order) followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 38,000g at 4 8C: buffer A, buffer AC0.2% Triton X-100, buffer AC 1 M NaCl, and buffer AC1 M urea. The washed inclusion bodies were solubilized in buffer AC6 M urea for 30 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 38,000g for 20 min at 4 8C and the pellet discarded. The solubilized inclusion bodies were purified by passage over a 16/10 Q-Sepharose Hi-Load anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated in buffer AC6 M urea. The column flow-through containing

the 6X protease to adopt an asymmetric conformation and to bind TL-3 in a conformation remarkably similar to that of substrate peptides19,28 may account for the partial recovery in catalytic efficiency toward a substrate peptide.8 The third step in the evolution of resistance resulted in the 6X protease mutant. While these mutations increased catalytic efficiency, they were not confined to the binding pocket and flaps. As described in Results, the surface of the protein in the 6X protease structure is altered near the side-chain of Pro63 relative to the 3X protease structure. This rearrangement results in the formation of a surface pocket, increasing the amount of solvent-exposed surface area in the 6Xa monomer, which should have a thermodynamically destabilizing effect that further increases the IC50 for TL-3 as in the 3X mutant.29­31 Increased flexibility of the flaps also augments their ability to bind and cleave asymmetric peptide substrates, as reflected in the increases in kcat/ Km for substrate peptide.8 Increased mobility of the flaps may be counterbalanced by tighter dimer interface packing resulting from the Leu24Ile mutation. Compensation between flap and b-sheet mobility has also been noted in the structure of Je-2147-HIV protease complex.26 Finally, the Val77Ile mutant has a direct steric effect, introducing asymmetry into the 6Xa versus 6Xb monomers and the conformation of bound TL-3. Biological significance The structural findings reported here suggest a stepwise progression of evolving protease resistance to the inhibitor, TL-3, with maintenance and then relative improvement of enzyme efficacy through two overlapping viral approaches. The increases in the Km seen in 1X and 3X mutants decrease the binding affinity for TL-3 by removing contacts with the inhibitor. Increases in k cat observed in 3X and 6X mutants increase catalytic efficiency for substrate peptide through enhanced flap mobility and the increased ability to adopt asymmetric conformations. These kinetic properties are expressed structurally as a progression from symmetric conformations (WT, 1X and 3X) to asymmetric conformations (6X), and from less mobile flaps (WT, 1X) to more mobile flaps (3X, 6X). The nature of the evolved resistance to the tight-binding, competitive inhibitor, TL-3, suggests that the design of protease inhibitors should give emphasis to those that not only bind tightly, but also do so in an asymmetric fashion more closely resembling substrate peptides.

the protease was collected and diluted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in buffer AC6 M urea. The protease was refolded by dialysis against buffer AC3 M urea at 4 8C for 8 h followed by dialysis against 20 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 25 mM NaCl, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol overnight at 4 8C. The refolded protease was centrifuged for 20 min at 38,000g at 4 8C to remove any precipitated material.

Mechanisms of Drug Resistance in HIV-1 Protease

Data collection For the wild-type protease, diffraction data were collected at 100 K by the rotation method (88 frames, ° 0.58 oscillation per frame) to 1.8 A on an R-Axis IV imaging plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator equipped with Osmic mirrors ° (lZ1.5418 A). The data were processed with d*trek36 (see Table 1). For the 1X protease, diffraction data were collected at 100 K by the rotation method (run 1, 120 frames, 18 oscillation per frame; run 2, 60 frames, 18 ° ° oscillation per frame) to 2.5 A at beamline 11-1 (lZ0.98 A) at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The data were processed with MOSFLM37 (see Table 1). For the 3X protease, diffraction data were collected at 100 K by the rotation method (45 frames, 28 oscillation per ° ° frame) to 1.85 A at beamline 9-2 (lZ0.979 A) at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The data were processed with MOSFLM37 (see Table 1). For the 6X protease, diffraction data were collected at 100 K by the rotation method (125 frames, 0.58 oscillation per frame) to ° 2.0 A using the same R-Axis IV imaging plate system as for the wild-type data. The data were processed with d*trek36 (see Table 1). Intensity statistics (N(z) test) computed with each of the four data sets indicated no evidence of twinning in the crystals used for data collection (data not shown). Structure solution and refinement The structure of wild-type protease was solved by ° molecular replacement calculations at 3 A using a monomer of the 1X protease structure (see below) as a search model in Molrep.38 Residues that differed in sequence between the two proteins were modeled as alanine. Five percent of randomly selected reflections were designated as test reflections for use in the free-R cross-validation method39 and used throughout the refinement. The correlation coefficient and R-factor from the molecular replacement solutions indicated that the correct space group was P6122. Rigid body and restrained ° refinement were performed in REFMAC40 at 3 A and ° 2.0 A, respectively. Simulated annealing, Powell minimization and individual temperature factor refinements were performed using CNS.41 After refinement, the model was adjusted and correct amino acids were built into regions of the composite omit map using the visualization program O.42 The model was refined further in REFMAC40 using isotropic temperature factors and several rounds of model adjustment and refinement performed using the SigmaA-weighted9 2jFojKjFcj and jFojKjFcj electron density maps generated in REFMAC.40 TL-3 was added by superposition of the wild-type structure with the structure of the 1X­TL3 complex. The conformation of the bound TL-3 was manually adjusted to fit the SigmaA-weighted9 jFojKjFcj electron density (2s) (see Supplementary Data). A total of 59 water molecules were added and six residues were modeled as having alternate side-chain conformations. The model was refined to a final Rcryst/Rfree of 23.4/28.6% in CNS (Table 1).39,41 The structure of 1X protease was solved by molecular ° replacement calculations at 3 A using a monomer of the protease structure (PDB 1KZK)26 as a search model in Molrep.38 The model was refined as described for the wild-type protease structure. TL-3 was added by superposition of the 1X structure with the structure of the FIV­TL3 complex (PDB 1FIV).43 The conformation of the bound TL-3 was manually adjusted to fit the

Addition of TL-3 For the wild-type, 3X, and 6X mutant proteases, TL-3 was added to a final concentration of 100 mg/ml, followed by exchanging twice with 4.5 ml of 100 mg/ml of TL-3 in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Particulate material was removed by centrifugation and the protein stored at 4 8C for subsequent crystallization trials. For the 1X mutant protease, TL-3 was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Any precipitated material was removed by centrifugation at 4 8C. The protein concentration was redetermined using the Bradford method.35

Crystallization For the wild-type protease, 2.5 ml of the protein at 5­10 mg/ml with added TL-3 was mixed with 2.5 ml of a solution of 31% ammonium sulfate, 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and equilibrated by sitting-drop, vapordiffusion at room temperature. Crystals formed within one week with dimensions of w10 mm!10 mm!50 mm. Crystals were harvested into mother liquor solution containing 20% (w/v) PEG 400, soaked for 5 to 10 min and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the 1X protease, 1 ml of the protein at 1 mg/ml with added TL-3 was mixed with 1 ml of a solution of 15% ammonium sulfate, 40 mM sodium citrate, 126 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) and equilibrated by hanging-drop, vapordiffusion at 8 8C. Hexagonal rod crystals formed within one week with dimensions of w10 mm!10 mm!100 mm. Crystals were harvested into mother liquor solution containing 30% PEG 400, soaked for 5 to 10 min and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the 3X protease, 1 ml of the protein at 5­10 mg/ml with added TL-3 was mixed with 1 ml of a solution of 20% PEG 4000, 200 mM magnesium chloride, 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.5) and equilibrated by hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion at 24 8C. Hexagonal rod crystals formed within one week with dimensions of w10 mm!10 mm!100 mm. Crystals were harvested into mother liquor solution containing 20% PEG 400, soaked for 5 to 10 min and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the 6X protease, 2.5 ml of the protein at 5­10 mg/ml with added TL-3 was mixed with 2.5 ml of a solution of 29% ammonium sulfate, 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 0.5 M sodium thiocyanate and equilibrated by sitting-drop, vapor-diffusion at room temperature. Tetragonal bipyramidal crystals formed within one week with dimensions of w50 mm!50 mm!50 mm.

distance was entered into a square matrix, where each row and column corresponded to one amino acid alpha-carbon atom in either the protease or inhibitor. Where the alpha-carbon could not be identified due to disordered electron density, no distances could be calculated. Thus, each distance matrix corresponded to one crystal structure and represented all the residue­residue distances in a given structure. For the 3X structure the protease dimer was generated by the application of the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. In order to compare these structures, it was thus possible to subtract one distance matrix for one crystal structure, 3X, from the distance matrix of another 6X, giving a so-called "difference distance matrix", 3X­6X. The resulting distances at each element in the square matrix reveal the change in position of the two residues: a positive value means that the two residues were further apart in 3X than in protein 6X, and thus going from 3X to 6X, these residues moved closer together; a value of zero means the two residues did not change their separation; and a negative value means that the residues were closer together in 3X than in 6X, and thus these two residues moved further apart going from 3X to 6X. These changes in residue­residue distance are then color-coded.

The model was refined to a final Rcryst/Rfree of 24.8%/30.2% in CNS (Table 1). The structure of 3X protease was solved by molecular ° replacement calculations at 3 A using a monomer of the wild-type protease structure as a search model in Molrep.38 The model was refined as described for the wild-type protease structure.

This region was removed from the model and manually rebuilt. After rebuilding, Gly52 and Leu53 were disordered and were omitted from the model. The model was refined further in REFMAC40 using isotropic temperature factors and several rounds of model adjustment and refinement performed in REFMAC.40 TL-3 was added by superposition of the 3X structure with the structure of the wild-type-TL3 complex. The conformation of the bound TL-3 was manually adjusted to fit the SigmaA-weighted9 jFojKjFcj electron density (2s). A total of 83 water molecules were added and seven residues were modeled as having alternate side-chain conformations. The model was refined to a final Rcryst/Rfree of 22.4%/27.0% in CNS (Table 1). The structure of 6X protease was solved by molecular ° replacement calculations at 3 A using a dimer of the wildtype protease as a search model in Molrep.38 Auto indexing trials and systematic absences indicated that the correct space group was I4122. This was confirmed by correlation coefficient and R-factor from the molecular replacement solutions. Rigid body and restrained refine° ° ment were performed in REFMAC40 at 3 A and 2 A, respectively. The model was refined as described for the wild-type protease structure. TL-3 was added by superposition of each monomer of the 6X structure with the structure of the wild-type-TL3 complex. Because the asymmetric unit of this crystal form contains an entire molecule of TL-3, the two halves of the TL-3 molecule were covalently linked for refinement calculations. The conformation of the bound TL-3 was manually adjusted to fit the SigmaA-weighted9 jFojKjFcj electron density (2s). In one 6X monomer (6Xb), the conformation of TL-3 was significantly altered relative to the conformation in the wild-type structure and was rebuilt to fit the difference density (see Results and Supplementary Data). A total of 154 water molecules were added and two residues were modeled as having alternate side-chain conformations. The model was refined to a final Rcryst/ Rfree of 22.7%/27.8% in CNS (Table 1). Difference distance matrix calculations The difference distance matrices were calculated with software developed by the authors written in the open source object-oriented programming language, Python (Python Software Foundation, Ipswich, MA), and PIL, the ¨ Python Imaging Library (Secret Labs AB, Linkoping, Sweden). For the 3X and 6X protease structures, a socalled distance matrix was calculated as follows: the coordinates of the alpha-carbon atoms of each chain of the homodimeric protease and of the C2-symmetric, TL-3, were used to calculate the distance between residues in a given crystal structure. Each such residue­residue

Protein Data Bank accession numbers The wild-type, 1X, 3X and 6X protease complex crystal structures with the inhibitor TL-3 have been deposited into the RCSB Protein Data Bank and have been assigned the accession codes 2AZ8, 2AZ9, 2AZB and 2AZC, respectively.
