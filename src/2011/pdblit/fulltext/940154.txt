The structure of pig heart lactate dehydrogenase complexed with the active coenzyme substrate analog (38).5(3.carboxy%hydroxypropyl) NAD+ was solved to high resolution. The results show: (1) The substrate and active site arrangements resemble closely the earlier ternary complex of lactate dehydrogenase and differ proposed "active" significantly from those in abortive ternary complexes of dogfish M, lactate dehydrogenase. (2) Small differences with respect to ternary inhibitor complexes of dogfish M, lactate dehydrogenasr occur in the coenzyme conformation as well as in the spatial arrangement of protein side-chains at the coenzyme binding site. (3) The "loop" is in an overall closed conformation typical for ternary complexes of lactate dehydrogenase, although it differs slightly from the conformation found in dogfish M, lactate dehydrogenase ternary complexes. (4) The stronger binding of NAD to the heart isoenzyme cannot be accounted for by an additional hydrogen bond to the pyrophosphate group via glutamine 31. (5) The anion binding sites found between P axis-related subunits in dogfish M, lactate dehydrogenase are also present in pig H, lactate dehydrogenase. It is proposed that in lactate dehydrogenase catalysis the pK value of the internal acid/base catalyst His195 is modulated by "loop" residue ArglO9. leading to substrak activation.

1. Introduction
The most abundant isoenzymes of tetrameric lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) in eukaryot,es are referred to as M (muscle) or A and H (heart) or B. They are biochemical and immunological characteristics distinct in several physical, (Wieland 8: Pfleiderer, 1957 : Markert & Moller. 1959 ; Fromm, 1961; Pfleiderer & t ,\uthor to whom reprint requests should be addressed.

2. Crystallography
The pig H, LDHase/S-lac-NAD+ complex crystallizes in space group P3,21 with cell dimensions a = 133.6 A and c = 113.5 A. The molecule sits on a 2-fold axis, with 2 subunits per crystallographic asymmetric unit. Data were collected to 2.7 A resolution using oscillation photography, CuK, radiation and an Elliott rotating anode X-ray generator. The orientation of the molecule in its unit cell was determined using a self-rotation function. The identification of the 3 different molecular axes was obtained from a cross-rotation function against the known structure of a dogfish LDHase ternary complex. The position of the pig H, LDHase molecule along the 2-fold axis was established from R-factor calculations for surcessive positions of the molecule along the crystallographic 2-fold axis, given the molecular orientation. Initial phases were then computed using the known ternary struct'ure. Thrse were refined by 4 successive cycles of electron density averaging. The final overall Rfact'or bet)ween observed structure amplitudes and those calculated from the averaged map was 19.6+, for 22.588 reflections. The average phase shift was 22.6" with respect to the initial molecular replacement model. The average phase shift between the 3rd and 4th molecular replacement averaging cycles was only 3". Atomic co-ordinates and structure factors havcx been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. A detailed description of tht structure determination will be given by Grau et al. (1981).

3. The Protein Model
Skew sections of the averaged electron densit,y map were calculated perpendicular to the molecular Q axis (for a definit,ion of the P. Q and R axes in LDHase, see Rossman et aZ., 1973). The map was plotted on a scale of 2 cm to 1 i% for modt+building in a Richards optical comparator (Richards, 1968). A Watson-Kendrew model of one subunit was built, in accordance with the known sequence of pig heart LDHase (Eventoff et al., 1977; Kiltz et al., 1977). Some parts of the protein are associated with relatively low density, which might' indicate partial disorder or flexibility. In particular, most of the C-terminal helix \H (residues 315 to 331) shows weak density, although this structural element was well-defined in all dogfish M, LDHase crystal structures. A standard helix could be built into the density, although the chain had to bridge small gaps in some places. The X-terminal arm. an ext'ended piece of polypeptide in interaction with the neighboring subunit relat,ed by the molecular R axis, is found in relatively weak density. particularly around residues 1 t'o 3 and 7 to 10 on the surface of t,hr Weaker densit'y is also found in parts of the loop connecting /3D and ~1) tetramer. (residues 99 t'o 112). It's flexibility had been suggested to be of functions.1 importance during catalysis and was associated with weak density in the dogfish M, LDHase crystal structures. On the other hand, the side-chain density of loop residue arginine 101. which forms an ion pair with the bound coenzyme's pyrophosphate. as well as arginine 109, which reaches into the active center pocket,. are well-defined. Some turns at the subunit surface (/3G/3K (residues 275 to 279). NlE--/3E (residues 130 to 132) and /3J&.lG (residues 219 to 222)) also appear partially disordered. For most of t'he molecule, however, the map is of good quality and thus allowed model-building with confidence. An isolated piece of density near the molecular P axis was interpreted as a bound &rate ion, since the crystals had been grown from 1.05 M-citrate solution. This observation is consistent with the results of Adams et al. (1973b), who found a

replaceable sulfat,e ion in a similar position for crystals of dogfish 31, LDHasc~ grown from ammonium sulfat,e solution. Residues binding th<> citrate ion art' conserved between dogfish M, and pig H4 LDHastl. Co-ordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms were taken wit)11 a calibrated plumb linrl and a horizontal grid. These raw co-ordinates were checked for gross errors itr measurement with the aid of a computer routine. The co-ordinates were idealized using Diamond's procedure (Diamond, 1966). The fitting converged smoothly with a root-mean-square value of 0.27 A between initial guide atoms and final values. Crystallographic refinement has been planned. Figure 2 shows a st,ereo plot, of one subunit of pig H, LDHase/S-lac-NAD+. C'o-ordinates have been dcapositrd with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank

4. Coenzyme-Substrate Model
The coenzyme densit,y is a prominent feature in the electron den&y map. By fat the highest, peak belongs to the pyrophosphate group in S-lac-S4Dt. A modrl of the coenzyme substrate analog was built into the density w-ith an eye on preferred conformat'ional angles derived from oligonucleotide and -nucleoside structurtas (Arnott Br Hukins, 1972; Sundaralingam, 1969). At the same time. its conformation was chosen to allow for interactions with the protein. For instance. t,he carboxyamide group was not forced exactly coplanar with the nicotinamide ring but allowed t'o rotate out of t'he plane by about IO'. such that, a hydrogen bond t,o serine 163 would be linear. (In the crystal structure of frer nicotinamide. the corresponding torsional angle was found t'o be 24" (Wright & King, 1954).) A C-3' endo adenine ribose fitted the density well and allowed for hydrogen bonds t,o aspartatr 53 and the peptide nitrogen of residue 30. The ribosr pucker of bhr

nicot,inamide ribose ring was chosen as (`-2' endo, since it yielded the best overall fit to t)he electron density and allowed for hydrogen bonds to glutamine 102 and serine 139. Thus. the torsional angle & (Fig. 3) lies in the gauche+ instead of the gauch,C range as had been observed for NAD bound to dogfish M, LDHase in the ternary complex (Table I). The former is energetically more favorable, since it lacks the close contact' of the 3' hydroxyl with the 5' oxygen lone pair. Bond distances, angles and dihedral angles were refined using t,he linked-atoms least-squares method (Smit,h B Arnott, 1978). The initial fitting of measured S-lac-NAD+ co-ordinates to a standard model allowed .a11t'orsional angles to vary but kept the adenine. nicotinamide and riboses as rigid bodies. The calculation converged with a root-mean-square value of 0.26 A. but, left some of the idealized atomic positions out of electron density. Therefore, a, more sophisticated model fitting was used where the ribose puckers were elastically restrained, instead of freezing the ribose conformations. Indeed, the ribose moieties might not exhibit a standard endo conformation, since only small energy barriers separate the various puckering modes (Saenger, 1973: Saenger et al., 1977). The angles T (Fig. 3) refined to 34.7" for the adenine ribose and -28% for the nicotinamide ribose, as opposed to the standard endo values of 36.9" and -35.6". respectively. The result of this refinement was satisfying in terms of distances to t'he measured co-ordinates (root-mean-square, 0.19 8) and with respect to the electron density. The S-lac-NADf co-ordinates referred t'o t,he molecular P, Q and R axes are given in Table 2.

intermediate low energy states of the closed form, and the weaker electron density in this area of the map could be caused by protein dynamics. It was suggested by Musick & Rossmann (1979), on the basis of the partially closed loop in apo LDHaseX, that the loop is in equilibrium between the open and closed forms in the unliganded state. Binding of coenzyme and substrate may have the effect of shifting the equilibrium toward a predominantly closed conformation. Loop oscillation has also been suggested t'o occur in various complexes in solution (Trommer & GlBggler, 1979). (`onsiderable conformational differences between the polypeptide fold in dogfish M, LDHase and pig H, LDHase are observed at the molecular surface of the catalytic domain (Fig. 4(c)). In the pig H, LDHase/S-lac-NAD' structure, the turn pH-@J is wider to accommodate the insertion of three residues at position 209, compared to the dogfish M, LDHase sequence (Eventoff et al., 1977). Furthermore. the turn /3J-%lG is shifted in the direction of the molecular & axis. Helix r2G is somewhat shifted and out of register, and its last turn is missing in the pig H, LDHase structure; on the other hand, the subsequent helix ,x3G has one additional turn at its beginning. A pronounced difference is indicated at the turn /?K-/3L and wit'hin /?L itself (residues 276 to 285), although the weaker density in the pig H, LDHase map in this area prohibits a quantitative comparison. The turn /3L+M (residues 299 to 304) is shorter in the present structure, whereas the turn /~M-IH is wider. Helix rH is associated with weak density. A possible reason for partial disorder in this area might be the very loose packing of molecules in the pig H, LDHase/Slac-NAD+ crystal, as indicated by 8, = 4.0 W3/dalton, which corresponds to approximately 70% solvent content (Matthews, 1968). Moreover. helix IH is not involved in intermolecular interactions in the crystalline array.

6. Subunit Contacts in Homo and Hybrid Tetramers
Contacts between subunits in LDHase are generated by the mutually perpendicular molecular P: & and R axes (Rossmann et al., 1973). Only the complete tetramer is catalytically active, suggesting that intersubunit interactions contribute to the structural integrity of the active site arrangement. Numerous and predominantly hydrophobic interactions are formed between 0 axis-related subunits. These involve residues belonging to helices aC. aB and ?t3G. and their counterparts a3G, aB and nC, respectively. Parts of EC also interact with helix a2F. In the pig H4 LDHase/S-lac-NAD+ complex, His68 on nC in one subunit forms a hydrogen bond with the e-nitrogen of the essential Arg171 on cv2F of the symmetry-related subunit. In addition, residues Met64 and Asp65 on aC shield the

However. only a "flip" of the guanidinium group of Xrgl'il about t!he NC-($ axis would be required for interaction and, thus, a modelhnilding error in the dogfish 31, LDHase structure seems possible. In general. 6, axis-generated contacts are highly conserved between dogfish ill, and pig H, LI)Hase (Eventoff et al., 1977). Therefore, in a hybrid oligomer consisting of dogfish 31 and pig H chains, Q axis-relat'ed subunit,s will be associated with each other in virtually the same fashion as in homotet'ramers (Fig. 5(a)). The extended N-t,erminal arm stretches along t,he surface of the neighboring subunit related by the molecular 12 axis. In t'he pig H, LDHase/S-lac-XAI)+ struc+uw. int'eractions are found around a hvdrophobic patch consisting of arm residues 1~~117, \`a11 1 and Ala12 of OIW subunit and residues Met274, (:ly%77. Leu298, Val302 and the aliphatic part, of the side-chain of LysI57 of the I% axisrt4ated suljunit. There is also hackhone hydrogen bonding between residues 1 I and 13 to the peptide groups of residues 298 and 301. respectively. The carboxylatr 01' carhoxyamide of A4sx20 is located in t)he vicinity of both Arg296 and Lys92 of thr neighboring subunit, possibly forming a hydrogen bond or ion pair. Xlt,hough t,he conformatjions of t,he S-terminal arms differ significantly in t'he LDHase H, and M, struct'ures, a common pat,tern of suburrit int,cractions between K axis-related subunits is apparent. This is demonstrat'ed in a hypothetical hybrid dimcbr consist'ing of an H and M LDHase chain (Fig. T,(b)). Thus, the X-terminal arm, despite t)he rather different conformat,ions observed in the dogfish M, LDHase and pig H4 LDHase homot'etramers, is suited to fit t)he surface of a, neighboring molecule regardless of whether it is an H or M chain. Moreover. the hydrogen bonds across the molecular R axis between the two As1122 residues are retained. Sequence (Eventoff et al., 1977) and structjural variability have been observed for residues involved in 1' axis rontacts hetbveen the pig H and dogfish M LDHa~sl;~ molecules. The insert'ion of three residues atI position 209 in the former extends int,l.) an area almost) devoid of protein in t'he dogfish &I, LDHase structures. However. a number of unreasonable cont'acts were noted in stereo diagrams of a hypot,het8ical JIH hyl)rid (Fig. 5(c)), Trp190 and Trp207 of the dogfish 51 LDHase subunit overlap to some extent the space required hy the additional residues at' position 209 in the pip H LDHase sul)unit8. More striking, residues 266 t'o 268 of the musclta isozyme and 1X3 to 185 of the 1' axis-related heart isozymr molreule occupy near]) the same volume and, hence, a peptide conformational change must take pla,ce on asseml)ly of the heterot~etramcr. On the other hand. thr csonserration of a hurd anion close t'o the molecular I' axis appears to indicate its functional import,ancr.

The respective electron density maps show this sequcnec difference quite clearly; hovvver. the (:11131side-chain in pig H, Ll>Hasf,/S-lat.-N,-\D' reaches int,o solution and does not interact with the eoenzyme.

The nivotinamide ribose best fits the electron densit*y in a (`-2' endo puckering mode. Hydrogen bonds would then be allowed between Ser139 and loop residue GInlO and the 2' and 3' hydroxyls. respectively. A C-3' endo nicotinamide ribose pucker was found in the dogfish M, LDHase ternary complexes (Adams et al.. et al., 1975). Thus, the hydroxyl groups point into quite different 1973~ : Holbrook directions in those two structures (Fig. 7) and interact, with the protein somewhat differently (Table 3). L)iff+renccs between coenzyme bound in the ternary complex with dogfish M, LDHase and pig H, LDHase are also observed at the nicotinamidr rings (Fig. 7). 1t is bound deeper in the active crevice in the pig H, LDHasrjS-lac-X.41)+ complex and its carboxyamide group forms a hydrogen bond to Serl63, whereas in the dogfish x1, LDHase ternary complexes the plane of the nicotinamide ring was such that' the carboxyamide group pointed t'oward His195. This change is accompanied by a slight' movement of Asn140. The more hydrophobic character in the protein environment on t,he H side of the nicotinamidr ring and t,he more hydrophilic chara&er on it,s ,A side are maintained. However, the conformation of residues on t,hra H side of the ring (cf. Thr216) have also changed considerably.

which extends to Argl71. Hence, the R configuration at (`-2 can be recognized, showing that the hydrogen at this asymmetry center points t,o the l-position of the nicotinamide ring. The interaction of t,he carboxylate group in A-k-NM)+ with the guanidinium group of ,4rg171 is symmetric and coplanar. The hydroxyl group forms hydrogen bonds to His195 and. possibly. to loop residue ArglO9 (Fig. 6). In the dogfish M, LDHase ternary inhibitor complexes, a quite different active sit'e arrangemertt had been found. No interaction between His195 and t,he 1 carbonyl group was apparent in the electron densities and the subst,rate carboxylate group was nearly perpendicular t,o the guanidinium group of Argl7l (Fig. 8). This abortive arrangement appeared to be frozen by additional ionic interaction of the second carboxylate group in oxalat,e with loop residue ArglO9. Nevertheless. in conjunction with kinetic data, an "active" ternary complex arrangement in LDHase had been proposed involving Argl71 and His196 as key

residues (Holbrook et al., 1975), which is now substantiated by the S-lac-NAD+ results, However, the presence of the active coenzyme-substrate analog has also given rise to further changes around the active site and variations in both the roenzyme and loop conformations. It seems probable that all these effects are interrelated. The closing of the loop brings the positive charge on iSrg109 close to Hisl95. When the substrate pyruvate is present (or after lactate oxidation), His195 is supposedly in a protonated state, whereas it is deprotonated when lactate is bound at the active site (Holbrook et al., 1975). Conceivably, ArglO9 could approach His195 closer if the latter bears no positive charge. In the pig H, LDHase/S-lacNXI)+ complex (Fig. 8), these groups are indeed separated by less than 3 8, as opposed to more t'han 4 A in the dogfish M, LDHase ternary inhibitor complexes. which resemble the pyruvate-bound state. Hence, the charge distribution at the LDHase active site could serve a dual function. After lactate oxidation. the developing charge at His195 would push ArglO9 away from the substrate and. ult8imately, force the loop to open under concomitant release of the reaction products. Similarly. introduction of the positive charge into t,he active site might lead to activation of the substrate pyruvate by modulation of the pK value of His195 and, therefore, forcing protonation of the substrate carbonyl group. The proposed modificat'ion of the "oil-water-histidine:' mechanism (Parker KT Holbrook. 1977) introduces a balance of charge repulsions and, hence, reversibility (Fig. 9). It seems possible that similar forces will operate in the activation of reaction partners at, the active site of other dehydrogenases, despite differences in detail. Thus. the strikingly similar relative positions of Arg171 in LDHase and Arg231 in glycrraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with respect to the essential histidines (Rossmann et al., 1977: Garavito et aZ., 1977) lead to the proposal of a similar for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate "charge repulsion balance" mechanism drhydrogrnasc (Grau, 1981 ).
