The synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel series of R-aryloxyphenylacetic acids as PPARR/ dual agonists are reported. The initial search for surrogates of the ester group in the screen lead led first to the optimization of a subseries with a ketone moiety. Further efforts to modify the ketone subseries led to the design and synthesis of two new subseries containing fused heterocyclic ring systems. All these analogues were characterized by their "super" PPARR agonist activity and weak or partial agonist activity on PPAR in PPAR-GAL4 transactivation assays despite their similar binding affinities for both receptors. The cocrystal structures of compounds 7 and rosiglitazone with PPAR-LBD were compared, and significant differences were found in their interactions with the receptor. Select analogues in each subseries were further evaluated for in vivo efficacy. They all showed excellent anti-hyperglycemic efficacy in a db/db mouse model and hypolipidemic activity in hamster and dog models without provoking the typical PPAR-associated side effects in the rat tolerability assay.
Introduction The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors in the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily.1,2 Three distinct PPAR subtypes (PPAR, PPAR and PPAR) have been identified in most mammalian species. The physiological role of the PPARs as regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism has been extensively reviewed in recent years.3-7 PPAR is well-known at a cellular level for its role in adipogenesis and has been implicated as the primary receptor modulating the antidiabetic activity through insulin sensitization.8,9 PPAR agonists, such as TZDs, have proven to be efficacious as insulin sensitizing agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.10-12 Unfortunately, they are also known to cause undesirable side effects including weight gain (as a result of enhanced adipogenisis and increased plasma volume), edema and anemia in both animal models and humans. PPARR is known to play a pivotal role in the uptake and oxidation of fatty acids and also in lipoprotein metabolism.13 Activation of PPARR is known to be the predominant mechanism by which fibrates lower triglycerides, elevate HDL and exert insulin sensitizing effects.14-20 Since the majority of type 2 diabetes patients suffer from atherogenic lipid abnormalities in addition to insulin resistance, both of which are maladies associated with the so-called metabolic syndrome,21 the concept of identifying ligands that activate both

PPARR and PPAR represents a logical continuation in the field of PPAR research. Indeed, there have been intense efforts within the pharmaceutical industry to develop PPARR/ dual agonists for clinical use (Chart 1).22-33 The first example, compound 1 (farglitazar),23 a potent PPAR agonist with a moderate PPARR component, was developed as a clinical candidate but was dropped due to the emergence

transactivation assay (TA) assay, this compound turned out to be a "super" agonist 35 for hPPARR and a weak agonist for hPPAR receptors. The novel structural features of compound 5 coupled with its interesting in vitro biological profile prompted us to embark on further investigation. A preliminary report describing some early structure-activity studies has appeared.31 This paper describes the synthesis, the SAR development, X-ray crystallography study and various in vivo evaluations of a new series of R-aryloxyphenylacetic acids that culminated in the discovery of compound 6 and 7. Chemistry Most compounds in the racemic series were readily synthesized by SN2 coupling between R-bromophenylacetates and three different types of phenols (Scheme 1). For the synthesis of the enantiomerically pure analogues, a highly stereoselective synthetic route based on the use of a lactate-derived chiral auxiliary 9 was adopted.36 Thus, the readily available phenylglyoxalic acid 8 was esterified with chiral auxiliary 9, and the resulting keto ester 10 was converted to the R-bromo ester 11 as a diastereomeric mixture. Displacement of the bromide by various lithium phenoxides, generated from the phenols 12, 13 and 14, proceeded in a highly stereoselective fashion to give the coupling product 15. Cleavage of the chiral auxiliary by simple hydrolysis gave three different subseries of R-phenoxyphenyl acetic acids, i.e., the ketophenol series (ArOH ) 12), the benzoxazolones (ArOH ) 13) and the benzisoxazolones (ArOH ) 14), typically with an enantiomeric excess greater than 96%. Each type of phenol used for the coupling reaction was synthesized by the synthetic routes that allowed for the incorporation of various R1, R2 and R3 groups in the indicated positions. In each case, the incorporation of the R2 and R3 group is generally made possible either by use of commercially available ortho-substituted phenols or by utilizing various reactions directed by the ortho phenolic hydroxyl group. For the preparation of ketophenol 12, a regioselective acylation at the position para to the phenolic hydroxyl group of 16 was achieved using various R1-substituted acids in neat triflic acid. Alternatively, the addition of Grignard agents R1MgX to the formyl group of 17 at the para position followed

of edema in an advanced stage of development. Two dual agonists with more substantial PPARR activity, 2 (ragaglitazar or DRF2725)25 and 3 (MK-767 or KRP297),24 were also dropped from late clinical development due to carcinogenicity in rodent toxicity models. So far, compound 4 (muraglitazar)28,33 is the only dual agonist candidate that has been successfully advanced to NDA filing.34 Thus, the development of PPARR/ dual agonists with novel biological profiles and structural diversity remains an attractive field for further exploration. Our research on PPARR/ dual agonists was initiated from the screening lead 5, which possessed a unique molecular architecture (Chart 2). It was a phenylacetic acid substituted at the R-position with a phenoxy group, to which was symmetrically attached two propyl groups on each side and an ester group at the para position. This structural feature differentiates compound 5 from most existing PPARR/ dual agonists reported in the literature, which are frequently represented by an amphiphilic molecular design including an acidic "headgroup" tethered with a chain to a lipophilic "tail group", such as those shown in Chart 1. Compound 5 was discovered as a PPAR ligand with micromolar hPPAR and nanomolar hPPARR affinity (PPAR_SPA IC50: R/ ) 0.082/1.1 µM). In the cell-based PPAR-GAL4 chimera

by oxidation has been used for the attachment of the R1 group (Scheme 2). The construction of the benzoxazolones 13 started with the nitrosation of R2,R3-substituted resorcinol 18 followed by reductive cyclization of the nitroso compound 19 to give cyclic intermediate 20. Subsequent N-alkylation with various alkyl halides allowed the introduction of various R1 groups (Scheme 3). To prepare the benzisoxazolone phenol 14, we have developed a novel method based on the use of the Mitsunobu reagent for cyclization of o-hydroxybenzohydroxamic acid 22.37 Compounds 22 were readily prepared from the corresponding hydroxybenzoic acids 21 and various R1-substituted hydroxyamines (Scheme 4). Results and Discussion In Vitro SAR Studies. Compounds were evaluated for in vitro potency and subtype selectivity in PPAR scintillation proximity assays (SPA) and expressed as IC50 for displacement of a radiolabeled reference compound. Their agonist responses were measured in the cell-based transactivation assay (TA) using PPAR-GAL4 chimeric receptors and a reporter gene containing a GAL-4 response element, and expressed as EC50, defined as the concentration of test compound to produce 50% of maximal reporter activity. The maximal activity of a given compound was measured against that of a reference full agonist, being defined as 100%. Since compound 5 itself was not suitable for in vivo studies due to the presence of an easily hydrolyzable

ester group (the corresponding diacid was completely inactive on PPAR R/ receptors), our SAR studies began with the search for surrogates of the ester group in 5. To this end, a variety of functional groups have been chosen to try to mimic the ester group (Chart 3). However, our initial attempt met with only limited success. Thus, the replacement of the ester group with an amide, a sulfone or a lactone moiety (compounds 23, 26, 27) led to the complete loss of activity. The relocation of the ester group from para to meta position (compound 24) also abolished the activity. The substitution of a gem-difluoropropyl group for the methyl ester (compound 25) retained much of the binding potency but suffered a considerable loss of activity in transactivation assay, suggesting that the presence of a carbonyl group in this region is required for maintaining functional activity. Fortunately, an ethylcarbonyl group was found to be able to imitate the original ester group to give compound 28, which maintained the same binding affinities for both R and  receptors as those of compound 5. With the successful replacement of a ketone for the ester residue, the structure-activity relationships involving the R1-R4 groups on the ketone-based scaffold were investigated in more detail (Table 1). In general, it was found that most active analogues in this series have inherited the unique in vitro profile of the lead compound 5, such that they all behaved as "super agonists" for PPARR and as weak or partial agonists for PPAR in transactivation assays despite of having comparable binding affinities for both R and  receptors. With regard to the R1 group, several lipophilic alkyl groups, but not aryls (compound 31), seemed to be well tolerated, though they did not offer any advantage over the ethyl group in terms of pharmacokinetic properties or in vivo efficacy. On the other hand, quite restrictive SAR was seen for the R2 and R3 groups attached to both sides of the phenoxy ring. Thus, operations involving the removal of the two n-propyl groups or the substitution of one or both of the n-propyl groups with other alkyls or halogens resulted in complete or significant loss of binding activity (32-36), indicating that there are distinct structural requirements for the two n-propyl group to be present at both positions. Most notably, the installation of a lipophilic group at the R4 position clearly increases the affinity for PPAR receptor, but not on the PPARR (e.g. compound 28 vs 38). To have

more balanced PPARR/ activity, an isopropyl group was chosen as the optimized R4 group since it imparts the best PPAR activity without sacrificing PPARR activity The effect of the stereochemistry at the R-position of the carboxylic acid was next examined. The opposite enantiomer of the isopropyl analogue 40, one of the most active compounds in the series, was prepared according to Scheme 1 using the S-enantiomer of compound 9 as chiral auxiliary. The absolute configuration of each enantiomer was deduced based on mechanistic consid-

eration36 and was further confirmed in the X-ray cocrystal structure with PPAR-LBD (vide infra). The binding activities of the two enantiomers were compared. The results clearly showed that the binding affinity for both R and  receptor mainly resided in the S enanantiomer, while the corresponding R enantiomer, compound 41, was 160-fold and 40-fold less potent on PPARR and PPAR, respectively. It should be noted that none of the analogues described here demonstrated significant binding to the PPAR receptor (IC50 > 15 µM).

Scheme 5. Mechanism for Photoinduced Decomposition of Compound 40

Chart 4. From Ketones to Benzoxazolones and Benzisoxazolones

In the ketone series, compound 40 appeared to have the best overall in vitro profile and more consistent activity on human and murine PPAR receptors. It was also one of the most efficacious compounds in our in vivo models for glucose and lipid lowering (vide infra). However, during preclinical evaluation of 40, we noticed that in an aqueous solution it showed some noticeable decomposition after being stored under ordinary laboratory light for 2 weeks. Since the decomposition occurred only under light and the product consisted mainly of the phenol 12b and aldehyde 46, we believed that the photoinduced fragmentation at the relatively weak benzylic ether bond was caused by the presence of the keto group at the para position which could well serve as sensitizer for photo activation (Scheme 5).38 To minimize the photoinstability problem, our first approach was to replace the ether linkage with a more robust bond such as a carbon-carbon or a carbonnitrogen bond. Unfortunately and somewhat surprisingly, none of them was able to imitate the role of the C-O bond and the corresponding carbo analogue 44 (X ) CH2) and nitrogen analogue 45 (X ) NH) were found to be devoid of PPAR activity. Thus the benzylic ether linkage in the current class of compounds appeared be essential for PPAR binding activity. Our next approach to deal with the stability problem was to eliminate the photosensitizing keto group in the ketone series. Given that ketone appeared to be the only suitable surrogate for the ester residue among several promising noncyclic structural candidates, as described previously in Chart 3, our next effort was focused on the use of some cyclic structures as possible replacements for the ketone moiety. Gratifyingly, we have found that two alkyl substituted heterocyclic motifs,i.e., oxazolones and isoxazolones, when fused into the aromatic ring, could mimic efficiently the alkyl ketone moiety (Chart 4). Table 2 details the SAR study that led to the optimization of compound 6 and 7. The R1 substituent on the nitrogen of each heterocyclic scaffold was investigated while keeping the R2, R3 and R4 groups the same as those optimized in the ketone series. The data suggested that a lipophilic alkyl group at the R1 position was well tolerated in the benzoxazolone series, though there was little to be gained from the additional steric bulk (6, 4751). On the other hand, increasing the size of R1 significantly eroded the binding activity in the benzisox-

azolone case (56 and 57), and a methyl group was found to be the best on both PPARR and  (7). The structureactivity relationships regarding the R2, R3 and R4 groups on the two heterocyclic scaffolds were found to be very much the same as those found in the ketone series. Thus, the replacement of the n-propyl group at R3 with chlorine or removal of the alkyl group at R4 reduced significantly the binding activity. Like the ketone analogues, compounds in these two heterocyclic series also exhibited "super" agonist activity for PPARR and weak or partial agonist activity for PPAR. On the basis of their overall in vitro profiles, compound 6 and 7, each representing the oxazolone and isoxazolone analogues, were chosen for further in vivo evaluation. X-ray Crystallography Studies. One of the interesting features displayed by the current class of compounds is that they all showed weak or partial agonist response toward the hPPAR receptor despite their relatively high binding affinity for the receptor and, as a indication of good cell permeability, a good match of potency in binding and transactivation assays. To further understand this interesting phenomenon, compound 7 was chosen to cocrystallize with PPAR-LDB (residues Gln203 to Tyr477) as a binary complex without coactivator/corepressor peptides. In this crystal form, there were two PPAR molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, one in the activated conformation and one in an unactivated conformation. The structure was solved at a nominal resolution of 2.50 Å with an R-factor of 24.4% and R-free of 30.2%. There was clear electron density for compound 7 in the activated molecule, but the inactivated binding site was empty. For the purpose of comparison, the structure obtained was superimposed on the cocrystal structure of rosiglitazone with PPAR-LBD, as shown in Figure 1. Compound 7 binds to the activated receptor with its carboxyl group forming a hydrogen bonding network involving Ser289 (helix 3), His323 (helix 6), His449 (helix 11) and Tyr473 (helix12). The isoxazolone ring sits in a hydrophobic pocket bounded by Ile281, Phe282, Cys285, Phe363 and Met364 in PPAR. This site leads into a larger chamber in PPAR which has been seen to accommodate groups the size of benzophenone (data unpublished).

Pharmacokinetic and in Vivo Studies. Three representative compounds (40, 6, and 7) have been chosen for extensive in vivo evaluation. First, their pharmacokinectic parameters were examined in rats and dogs. As shown in Table 3, when dosed orally, all three compounds exhibited good exposure with excellent bioavailability and a good half-life. Next, the in vivo pharmacology of compounds 6 and 7 was studied in a well-established rodent model of diabetes, using male db/db mice (10-11 week-old C57BLKS/J-m +/+Leprdb mice), which is characterized by severe insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and marked hyper-triglyceridemia. As depicted in Figure 2, when dosed orally at 3 and 10 mg/kg by gavage once daily for 11 days, the two compounds demonstrated robust doserelated serum glucose-lowering efficacy (-69%, -95% for 6 at 3, 10 mpk and -58% for 7 at 10 mpk) that is either superior or comparable to the marketed PPAR agonist rosiglitazone dosed at 10 mg/kg (-70% glucose reduction). As described above, both compounds 6 and 7 had PPAR binding potency similar to that of rosiglitazone (PPAR IC50  0.20 µM) but weaker agonist responses in the transactivation assay. Although it is not clear what fraction of the observed antihyperglycemic activity of these compounds is contributed by their PPAR activity, the present results and the recent report of PPARR-mediated insulin sensitization19,20 sug-

helix 3, used by nearly all of the agonists whose complex structures have been solved.27,39-41 However, unlike rosiglitazone, no part of 7 extends past the Cys285/ Met364 boundary. Overall, these results suggested that simply forming a direct link to helix 12, although necessary, is not sufficient for full agonism. There may be some other aspect of compound 7, such as compound size, shape and position in the ligand binding pocket that is unable to affect PPAR in the same manner as rosiglitazone. Although we do not have the corresponding structure of compound 7 with the PPARR receptor at this moment, it can be certain that compound 7 will also bind to the PPARR receptor in somewhat different fashion from a typical full agonist because of its relatively compact structure. In this context, the interesting question of why its interaction with the R receptor elicited an unusually higher agonist response in the PPARR-GAL4 transactivation assay remains to be answered.

gest that a dual PPARR/ agonist can provide better glucose control than currently marketed selective PPAR agents. To determine the ability of the current class of compounds to impact lipid homeostasis, male Syrian hamster and male Beagle dogs were used to investigate the effects of compounds 40, 6 and 7 on the serum levels of triglyceride and total cholesterol. The former preclinical animal model faithfully predicts the clinical lipid modulating efficacy of fibric acid derivatives and the latter of fibric acid derivatives and statins.42 As shown in Table 4, when administered orally to hamsters (N ) 6) daily for 14 days compound 40 achieved superior cholesterol and triglyceride lowering compared to fenofibrate even at significantly lower dose. The apparent lack of dose response regarding the cholesterol reduction by 40 may suggest either a saturation of the response or a similar drug exposure at two doses. Further pharmacokinetic measurement should help to clarify this. The less robust lipid decrease by compound 6 and 7 may partly be due to their less potent hamster PPARR activity (6: EC50 ) 0.96 µM; 7: EC50 ) 0.45 µM) compared with that of compound 40 (EC50 ) 0.085 µM). In male Beagle dogs, good lipid lowering efficacy was again achieved by both compound 40 and 7 (Table 5), though 40 was somewhat more potent (EC50 ) 0.13 µM) than 7 (EC50 ) 0.60 µM) in dog PPARR transactivation assay. It is worth noting that in the same dog model, the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Simvastatin was able

to lower cholesterol by 16% when dosed at 4 mg/kg.42 These results clearly indicated that our PPARR/ dual agonists can provide comparable cholesterol lowering efficacy to that achieved by fibrate drugs at much high doses or by statin drugs at similar dose levels. To assess the typical PPAR agonist-mediated side effects, compounds 6 and 7 were tested in a two week normal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat tolerability study using the PPAR full agonist rosiglitazone as a positive control. As shown in Table 6, the typical effects that include brown adipose tissue (BAT) proliferation, heart weight increases and hematocrit decrease were not seen with the current three compounds. The only major finding was an expected PPARR driven liver weight increase and some body weight decrease. In contrast, rosiglitazone increased heart weight by 22% and BAT depot mass 260% and decreased hematocrit by 12.5%. The lack of these PPAR-related side effects with compounds 6 and 7 could well be due to the fact that these compounds possessed only partial PPAR agonist activity, thereby raising the possibility that such agents may exert their PPAR-mediated beneficial in vivo metabolic effects without provoking the undesirable side effects. Alternatively, the lack of PPAR-mediated side effects may suggest that their in vivo pharmacology may have been largely driven by their PPARR activity. Conclusion In summary, we have described the synthesis and structure-activity studies of new series of R-aryloxyphenylacetic acid derivatives as a novel class of PPARR/ dual agonists. Unlike most PPARR/ dual agonists disclosed in the literature, these compounds are characterized by their balanced binding affinity for both PPARR and  receptors along with a "super" agonist activity in PPARR-GAL4 TA assay and a weak or partial agonist activity toward PPAR. The X-ray crystallographic analysis of cocrystal structures of PPAR-LBD complexed respectively with compound 7 and rosiglitazone revealed a similarity as well as some significant differences in their interactions with the receptor. These differences were used to explain why most compounds described here elicited a partial agonist response toward PPAR despite of their relatively high affinity for the receptor. Most notably, the three compounds chosen for in vivo evaluation demonstrated excellent anti-hyperglycemic efficacy in the db/db mouse and hypolipidemic activity in hamster and dog models, without provoking the typical PPAR-mediate toxicity in rat tolerability model. These results suggest that further efforts to develop these novel PPARR/ dual agonists as improved therapies for type 2 diabetes,

In Vitro Assays. Activities of compounds were evaluated for both binding affinity and functional activity. First, binding affinities for the PPARs were measured in a scintillation proximity assay (SPA).43 Second, potencies of PPAR gene activation were evaluated in cell-based transcription assays using GAL4-PPAR chimeric receptors as previous described.44 All results were produced in triplicate, and mean values are reported. Generally, compound synthesis was driven by the SAR developed from these two assays. In Vivo db/db Mouse Studies. db/db (C57BLKS/J-m +/+Leprdb) mice were used as a type 2 diabetic animal model. Male db/db mice at 12-13 weeks of age and nondiabetic db/+ (lean) mice from Jackson Laboratories were housed seven mice per cage and fed a rodent chow (Purina no. 5001) ad libitum with free access to water. Mice (seven per group) received a once daily oral dosing of test compounds with vehicle (0.25% methylcellulose) by oral gavage for 11 days. Blood was collected from the tail immediately prior to the next dosing at days 0, 4, 7 and 11 for measurement of the plasma glucose levels. Hamster Lipid Studies. Golden Syrian hamsters weighing between 120 and 150 g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and used for the experiments. Hamsters were housed in boxes (five per box) and fed a normal rodent chow ad libitum with free access to water. Hamsters (10 for each group) were orally dosed with compounds (suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose) for 9 days. On the morning of the 10th day, hamsters were euthanized with carbon dioxide, and blood samples were obtained via heart puncture. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined from the samples. Dog Lipid Studies. Mature male Beagle dogs weighing between 12 and 18 kg were purchased from Marshall Farm, PA. They were housed individually and fed a cholesterol-free chow diet ad libitum with free access to water. Prior to starting experiments, the dogs (five for each group) were bled weekly from the jugular vein and their serum cholesterol levels were determined. Test compounds were suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose and gavaged daily to the dogs for 2 weeks. Blood samples were taken during and after the dosing periods, and serum cholesterol levels were determined. Rat Tolerability Studies. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing about 200 g from Charles River were house 3 rats per cage and provided free access to water and rodent chow. Rats (n ) 6) were orally dosed once daily by gavage with test compounds at indicated doses in 0.5% methylcellulose. Body weights were measured prior to each dosing on days 1, 4, 6 8, 11 and 14. Animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide 24 h following the last dose and the indicated tissue and organs were removed and weighed. Blood samples were drawn via heart puncture and assayed for serum chemistry. Pharmacokinetic Studies. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n ) 3), male adult Beagle dogs (n ) 4), and male adult Rhesus monkeys (n ) 3) that had been fasted overnight received an oral gavage dose of 2 mg/kg, or an intravenous dose of 0.5 mg/ kg by bolus injection. Blood samples were obtained from the femoral arterial cannula for rat, and the jugular vein for dog, at designated time points into heparin-containing tubes. The plasma was prepared immediately by centrifugation, acidified

Purified PPARgamma-LBD (residues Gln203 to Tyr477) at 10-15 mg/mL was mixed with compound 7 at a 1.6:1 ratio of compound:protein on ice and allowed to stand at 4 °C overnight. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature in 2 µL "sitting" drops that contained equal volumes of the protein complex solution and a reservoir solution consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.65-0.90 M Na3 citrate, 1 mM TCEP, against 0.5 to 1.0 mL reservoir solutions in a Cryschem MVD-24 crystallization tray. Crystals were transferred to 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.44 M Na3 citrate, and 1 mM TCEP and vitrified by plunging the nylon-loop-captured crystals into liquid nitrogen. A crystal was put into a cold, -170 °C nitrogen gas stream generated by a CryoStream model 600 (Oxford Cryosystems Inc.) for the duration of the diffraction experiment. X-ray diffraction data were collected in-house on a Rigaku FR-D X-ray generator operating at 50 kV, 100 mA, 20% bias voltage with the Cu KR

PPARR/ Dual Agonists beam focused with Osmic mirrors ("purple" optics). The diffraction data were collected as a series of 540 0.5° rotation images using an ADSC Quantum 4R 2 × 2 CCD area detector mounted on a Crystal Logics goniometer. Exposure time was set to keep low resolution reflection overloads at a minimum without significantly impacting the quality of the highresolution data. Data were measured from a single crystal exhibiting C2 symmetry to a resolution of 2.5 Å. Measured intensities were reduced and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL suite45 that yielded an average redundancy on measurements of approximately 5 and an Rsym of 0.077 (see Supporting Information). The structure was solved using the coordinates for a previously elucidated selenomethionine PPAR-LBD complex (unpulished results). Following rigid-body refinement of the starting structure, compound 7 was incorporated between rounds of model building using CHAIN46 or XTALVIEW47 and refinement using CNX (version 2002 Accelrys, Inc.)48,49 The coordinates may be found in the Protein Data Bank under ID code 1ZEO.
