Cutinase from the fungus Fusarium solani pisi is a lipolytic enzyme able to hydrolyze both aggregated and soluble substrates. It therefore provides a powerful tool for probing the mechanisms underlying lipid hydrolysis. Lipolytic enzymes have a catalytic machinery similar to those present in serine proteinases. It is characterized by the triad Ser, His, and Asp (Glu) residues, by an oxyanion binding site that stabilizes the transition state via hydrogen bonds with two main chain amide groups, and possibly by other determinants. It has been suggested on the basis of a covalently bond inhibitor that the cutinase oxyanion hole may consist not only of two main chain amide groups but also of the Ser42 O side chain. Among the esterases and the serine and the cysteine proteases, only Streptomyces scabies esterase, subtilisin, and papain, respectively, have a side chain residue which is involved in the oxyanion hole formation. The position of the cutinase Ser42 side chain is structurally conserved in Rhizomucor miehei lipase with Ser82 O, in Rhizopus delemar lipase with Thr83 O1, and in Candida antartica B lipase with Thr40 O1. To evaluate the increase in the tetrahedral intermediate stability provided by Ser42 O, we mutated Ser42 into Ala. Furthermore, since the proper orientation of Ser42 O is directed by Asn84, we mutated Asn84 into Ala, Leu, Asp, and Trp, respectively, to investigate the contribution of this indirect interaction to the stabilization of the oxyanion hole. The S42A mutation resulted in a drastic decrease in the activity (450-fold) without significantly perturbing the three-dimensional structure. The N84A and N84L mutations had milder kinetic effects and did not disrupt the structure of the active site, whereas the N84W and N84D mutations abolished the enzymatic activity due to drastic steric and electrostatic effects, respectively.

ABSTRACT:

Cutinase from the fungus Fusarium solani pisi is a lipolytic enzyme which acts on both monomeric and aggregated triglycerides but which shows no enhancement of its activity in the presence of a lipid-water interface (Kolattukudy, 1984; Lauwereys et al., 1991). This enzyme has been well studied: its X-ray structure has been refined at 1.25 Å resolution (Martinez, 1992) and is being extended up to 1.0 Å resolution (S. Longhi et al., unpublished results). Around 40 X-ray structures of cutinase mutants and inhibitor conjugates have been solved to date (S. Longhi et al. and Nicolas et al., unpublished results). Cutinase is also an excellent model for kinetically probing the lipolytic machinery due to its ability to hydrolyze soluble substrates. In recent years, the amount of knowledge available about lipase structure and enzymatic structure-function has increased tremendously (Brady et al., 1990; Winkler et al., 1990; Brzozowski et al., 1991; Schrag et al., 1991; van Tilbeurgh et al., 1992, 1993; Grochulski et al., 1993; Bourne et al., 1994; Noble et al., 1994; Derewenda et al., 1994;

Uppenberg et al., 1994; Jaeger et al., 1994; Egloff et al., 1995). These soluble enzymes have in common their structure, the R/ hydrolase fold (Ollis et al., 1992) and the surface loop, called the "lid", covering their active site. During the catalytic process, a structural rearrangement of this lid occurs, allowing the substrate to dock in the active site. In most cases, optimal oxyanion hole geometry is achieved only via this structural change. These phenomena have been thought to provide the structural explanation for the activation of lipases which occurs in the presence of a lipid-water interface. Among these lipolytic enzymes, cutinase has unique properties since its active site serine is not covered by a lid and its oxyanion hole is preformed (Martinez et al., 1994). These two facts explain why it does not display any interfacial activation in the presence of aggregated substrate (Martinez et al., 1992). Using phosphorylating agents makes it possible to block the esterases, lipases, and various serine-dependant hydrolases reaction mechanism at the acylation step via the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate (Kraut, 1977). The negatively charged oxygen of the tetrahedral intermediate, originating from the substrate oxyanion, is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with two peptide NH groups of the main chain enzyme, leading to the formation of the so-called oxyanion hole. The oxyanion hole is a common feature which is present in all the known serine proteases (Kraut, 1977; Warshel et al., 1989), esterases (Sussman et al., 1991; © 1996 American Chemical Society

Characterization of the Cutinase Oxyanion Hole Wei et al., 1995), lipases (Brady et al., 1990; Brzozowski et al., 1991; van Tilbeurg et al., 1993; Grochulski et al., 1993; Derewenda et al., 1994; Egloff et al., 1995), and serine carboxypeptidases (Liao & Remington, 1990). These hydrogen bonds seem to accelerate the reaction by distorting the ground state acyl-enzyme structure along the enzymatic pathway (Pauling, 1946). A tetrahedrically distorted carbonyl exists in complexed enzymes, and this distortion is essential for strong oxyanion hole hydrogen bonds to be formed. The strength of the hydrogen bonds in the acylenzyme between the carbonyl and the oxyanion hole has been found to positively be correlated with an increase in the rate of deacylation (Whiting & Peticolas, 1994). The three-dimensional structure of cutinase inhibited with diethyl paranitrophenyl phosphate (E600)1 was recently solved (Martinez et al., 1994). The inhibitor, which blocks the reaction at the acylation step, mimicks the first tetrahedral intermediate, thus making it possible to identify the cutinase oxyanion hole components. The fact that cutinase, like serine proteases, shows very little change in the position of its catalytic residues as the result of the complex formation suggests that, in its native state, the active site may be complementary to tetrahedral reaction intermediates. The oxyanion hole of cutinase can be described in terms of the interactions between the phosphate inhibitor, E600, and several main chain and side chain cutinase atoms: Ser42 N, Gln121 N, and Ser42 O interact directly with the oxyanion. Asn84 N2 and Gln121 N 2 maintain Ser42 O in the proper orientation for the hydrogen bonding of the oxyanion to occur. Ser42 therefore occupies a central position in the oxyanion hole pocket, not only because its main chain NH group is a hydrogen donor contributing to the oxyanion formed but also because its side chain O atom is within hydrogen bonding distance from the oxyanion. We therefore mutated this residue into an alanine which is unable to hydrogen bond to the oxyanion. Point mutants that selectively disrupt each of these interactions were designed in order to assess the potential function of the Ser42 side chain as part of the cutinase oxyanion hole. Mutating Ser42 into Ala would cancel the direct interaction between the oxyanion and residue 42 side chain O. One of the two residues belonging to the second shell were also mutated: Asn84 into Ala, Leu, Trp, and Asp. Structural modifications of these cutinase mutants were evaluated as regards their ability to hydrolyze paranitrophenyl-butyrate (pnp-butyrate) in solution, since cutinase is able to hydrolyze this soluble substrate. Any secondary effects originating from interfacial activation can therefore be dissociated from the primary effects on the integrity of the oxyanion hole. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cutinase Site-Directed Mutagenesis. A 670 base pair synthetic gene of normal F. solani pisi cutinase obtained by cassette assembly was cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites of a pUC19 derived vector (Unilever vector) prior to the subcloning steps. The gene was expressed in

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction method (PCR; Dulau et al., 1989; Ho et al., 1989). The following experimental conditions were used: approximately 10 ng of pUC19 plasmid DNA harboring the cutinase gene was used as a template for PCR in a total volume of 50 µL containing 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Pharmacia) (Kadowaki et al., 1989), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2 mM MgCl2, 200 µM dNTPs (Pharmacia), and 100 pmol of each primer and covered with 100 µL of light mineral oil. PCR was performed in 30 cycles, each of which consisted of a denaturing step at 95 °C, a primer annealing step at 58 °C for 1.5 min, and an extension step at 72 °C for 1.5 min using a Perkin Elmer cetus DNA thermal cycler. The amplified DNA fragments were then subcloned into the shuttle vector, thus replacing the native sequence. All the constructs were characterized by performing sequence analysis on the complete cutinase insert. Synthetic fluorescent oligonucleotides were synthesized (Smith et al., 1985) in order to perform fluorescent automatic sequencing (Smith et al., 1986) combined with Sanger's dideoxynucleotide termination method (Sanger et al., 1980). Purification of the Mutants. A volume of 25-125 mL of SP Sepharose fast flow gel (17-0729-01, Pharmacia) was added to each variant solution (0.01 M sodium acetate, 0.025 M NaCl, pH 4.6). The cutinase mutants were eluted from the strong cation exchange column with 0.01 M TEA/HCl and 0.025 M NaCl, pH 9, at a flow rate of 7 mL/min. The eluate was filtered through a DEAE-cellulose (DE 52, Whatman) and adjusted to pH 9 before being loaded onto a Q Sepharose fast flow (17-0510-01, Pharmacia) column. The elution was carried out at pH 9 with a linear NaCl gradient of 0.025-0.4 M and a flow rate of 7 mL/min. The last purification step consisted of an affinity chromatography using a Con-A Sepharose 4B (17-0440-01, Pharmacia) column in order to remove any glycosylated fractions. Electrospray mass spectrometry was used to confirm the identity of the variants obtained and to check whether any residual glycosylation was present. After dialysis and lyophilization, each mutant was dissolved at 1 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM NaCl, pH 9, to measure the specific activity on triolein stabilized with gum arabic (Sigma). ActiVity Measurements. The enzymic activities of the mutants were quantified in duplicate using pnp-Butyrate in butanol 100% as the substrate, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mM. Assays were performed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9, at 30 °C, containing 1 or 0.1 mg/mL of each variant. The reaction rates were determined by measuring the rate of paranitrophenol release at 405 nm ( ) 15 300 M-1 cm-1). The kinetic constants, VM and kcat, determined from nonlinear regresssion curves (Duggleby, 1981) based on the initial rate data, are summarized in Table 1. Crystallization and Structure Determination of the Mutants. The cutinase mutants were crystallized using the vapour diffusion technique (Matthews, 1968), under conditions similar to those used with the wild-type enzyme (Abergel et al., 1990). Crystals were obtained in 100 mM Hepes, pH 7, using PEG 6000 as precipitant in the range of 10-20%, except for N84L, which required lower PEG

Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1996 401 Forty cycles of conjugate gradient minimization were followed by molecular dynamics (0.001 ps at 300 K), 360 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, and 40 cycles of restrained individual B factor refinement. Reflections between 6.0 Å and the highest resolution (Table 2) were used in the refinement, and (2FoFc) and (FoFc) difference maps were calculated between 20.0 and 1.6 Å resolution. These were inspected on Silicon Graphics workstations using the TURBO graphics program (Roussel & Cambillau, 1991). (2FoFc) electron density maps corresponding to the mutated residues are given in Figure 1. Luzzati plots gave an average estimated error of 0.07 Å. Structural alignment was performed with the RIGID option of the TURBO graphics program (Roussel & Cambillau, 1991). All mutant CR atoms located at less than 0.5 Å from their native corresponding ones were included in the leastsquares adjustment procedure. The rmsd values resulting from this procedure, calculated on the basis of 194 CR, were 0.043 Å (S42A), 0.068 Å (N84A), 0.037 Å (N84L), 0.077 Å (N84W), and 0.187 Å with N84D, which is the only one belonging to a different crystal form. RESULTS Three levels of interaction between the enzyme and the phosphate inhibitor can be distinguished in the area of the cutinase oxyanion hole (Figure 2A): in the first shell, Ser42 N, Gln121 N, and Ser42 O interact directly with the oxyanion (P)-O3 oxygen. The interactions of (P)-O3 with Ser42 N (2.86 Å) and Gln121 N (2.87 Å) in the oxyanion hole are tight and equidistant. A third hydrogen bond, established with the Ser42 O side chain, is shorter (2.68 Å). The second interaction shell comprises Asn84 N2 and Gln121 N 2 atoms, which are hydrogen bond donors and as such maintain the Ser42 hydroxyl group in the appropriate orientation for the hydrogen bonding of the oxyanion atom to take place. In the third shell, tetracoordinated water molecules properly orientate Asn84 O1 and Gln121 O 1 side chain atoms. The wild-type cutinase catalytic pocket contains a water molecule located close to the active serine,

concentrations (2-5%). S42A and N84A-L-W crystals were found to be isomorphous to the wild-type enzyme and to have space group P21 and the following cell parameters: 35.12 Å, 67.36 Å, 37.05 Å, and ) 94°. N84D still crystallized in P21 but had different cell parameters: 36.95 Å, 64.23 Å, 37.11 Å, and ) 116.12°. X-ray diffraction data were measured on a 18 cm MARResearch Imaging plate detector (Mar-research, Hamburg, Germany) mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode (running at 40 kV × 80 mA). The data were reduced with the Imaging plate version of the XDS program (Kabsch, 1988) and the CCP4 program package (SERC Daresbury Laboratory, UK). Data reductions are given in Table 2. The structure of N84D mutant was solved by performing molecular replacement using the AMoRe program (Navaza, 1994). The coordinates of the native cutinase were placed in a P1 cell having the dimensions a ) b ) c ) 60 Å. The rotation function was calculated in the resolution range of 20-4 Å with a Patterson integration radius of 30 Å.

We used the 3.1 version of the X-PLOR program package (Brunger, 1992) for the crystallographic refinement and the ¨ structural analysis, which involved the Engh-Huber force field (Engh & Huber, 1991). The starting model was taken from the cutinase structure refined at 1.25 Å resolution (Martinez, 1992a). A standard simulated annealing protocol (Brunger, 1989) was first used to refine the variant structures. ¨

hydrogen bonded to its O atom (2.75 Å) (Figure 2B). This solvent molecule (W529) located at the bottom of the catalytic pocket is topologically equivalent to the oxyanion, since it is located at 0.93 Å from the (P)-O3 oxygen in the complex with E600 (Figure 2B). Although this water molecule is tricoordinated, its B factor remains high (33 Å2), reflecting some disorder or partial occupancy. Residues Leu81 and Val184 form a bridge over the active site groove (Martinez et al., 1992b). Two pockets were identified on either side of this bridge: one of them has Ser120 O and Ser42 O at the bottom, and the other is lined by the Asn84 side chain. In the structure of the E600 inhibited cutinase, the inhibitor is docked under this bridge and fills both pockets. Mutant S42A. The structure of the S42A mutant active site does not display any drastic changes as compared to that of the native enzyme (Figure 3A). The geometry of catalytic triad Ser120, His188, and Asp175 has not been altered (Tables 3 and 4), and the position of the Ala42 C atom is that of the wild-type serine C . Furthermore, the main chain NH groups of Ser42 and Gln121 are still in a favorable position to form hydrogen bonds with the oxyanion. Due to the absence of the O atom, however, the second

hydrogen bond shell established in the wild-type enzyme between Asn84 N2, Gln121 N 2, and Ser42 O is completely lost in the structure of the mutant. This mutant still has the same double position in the case of its N84 N2 atom (position B in Figure 3A) as in the native structure (not shown in the figure). The position of N84 O1 is conserved among all the mutants, due to the hydrogen bond with the water molecule W531. The water molecule (W529) observed in the active site crevice, close to the position of the oxyanion, keeps its position at the bottom of the pocket. The mutation S42A results in the loss of an O atom and leads to the extension of the active site pocket, where a second water molecule (W860) is visible at the top of the pocket (Figure 4A). W529 still maintains its hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide groups of residues 42 (2.97 Å), and 121 (2.98 Å) and with the side chain O of the active Ser (2.60 Å); it establishes a new hydrogen bond with the extra water molecule W860 (3.04 Å). In the alternate position B, the tricoordinated water molecule W860 stabilizes the orientation of Asn84 N2 atom through a hydrogen bond (2.90 Å). The activity of the S42A mutant on pnp-butyrate is drastically reduced to 0.22% relative to level recorded with

the native enzyme (Table 1). This decrease is due to the collapse of kcat, by a factor of about 450, whereas the KM remains almost constant. These data provide direct evidence that this residue plays an essential role in stabilizing the transition state oxyanion and that the S42A mutant keeps its affinity for the substrate. Mutations of Asn84. Asn84 N2 is a rather solventexposed atom (with a water accessibility of 5.29 Å2) with an above average B factor (18.46 Å2). Moreover, the high resolution maps show that Asn84 N2 has two alternate positions (A. Nicolas, unpublished results). In position A (Figure 2B), Asn84 is involved in stabilizing the orientation of the Ser42 side chain through a hydrogen bond with N84 N2 atom (3.1 Å); N2 atom itself is stabilized by means of two other hydrogen bonds, the one with a water molecule close to the active serine (2.9 Å), and the other with Leu81 carbonyl oxygen (2.80 Å). Position B is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds involving water molecules. N84 O1, on the contrary, has an accessibility of 0.29 Å2 and a B factor of 15.36 Å2, and it does not have a double position. It is stabilized via a single hydrogen bond (2.71 Å) with a tetracoordinated water molecule (W531; B factor of 10.15 Å2). The location of Asn84 close to the enzyme surface and its hydrogen bonding with Ser42 O makes it a good candidate for checking various substitutions leading to electrostatic or steric modifications in the vicinity surrounding the oxyanion hole. N84A and N84L. Mutations N84A and N84L were designed to disrupt two hydrogen bonds, Asn84 N2 with Ser42 O and Asn84 O1 with the tetracoordinated water molecule W531, without introducing any significant electrostatic or steric modifications. Mutant N84A loses these two hydrogen bonds, and an empty space is created near the active site crevice (Figure 3B). Mutant N84L also loses its two hydrogen bonds, but it is almost isosteric with Asn (Figure 3C). The structures of the N84A and N84L mutant active sites do not display any drastic changes. The catalytic triad involving Ser120, His188, and Asp175 shows no

change, and these residues have deviations of only 0.19 Å in the case of N84A and 0.13 Å in that of N84L (Table 3); the catalytic triad hydrogen bonds remain unchanged (Table 4). Furthermore, the oxyanion can still be stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the NH groups of Ser42 and Gln121 and also by the Ser42 side chain. In the second shell of hydrogen bonds, the Gln121 N 2 atom alone establishes a hydrogen bond with Ser42 O. The most significant differences between N84A and N84L result from differences in the bulkiness of the side chain between alanine and leucine. Since the Leu84 side chain is not stabilized by any hydrogen bonds, it drifts into the active site pocket. The mutation of N84A results, as with S42A, in the loss of an oxygen atom, which is replaced by a water molecule, W860. W529 loses its hydrogen bond with both backbone amides but still keeps its hydrogen bonds with the O atom of the catalytic serine (3.04 Å) and with the O of Ser42 (2.49 Å); it also establishes a hydrogen bond with the water molecule W860 (3.12 Å). Despite the fact that water molecule W860 is tricoordinated, as in the S42A mutant, its hydrogen bonding network is different, which indicates the existence of contacts with Ser120 O (2.70 Å), His188 N 2 (2.78 Å), and water 529. The catalytic pocket of the N84L mutant contains the water molecule W529, but in a position which has shifted to the opposite side of the second pocket, as compared with the native structure. Water molecule W529 still maintains its hydrogen bonds with backbone amide groups of residues 42 (2.97 Å), with the side chain O of the active Ser120 (2.60 Å) and with Ser42 O (2.60 Å). In mutant N84L, the side chain of Leu 84 is no longer stabilized by a hydrogen bond and occupies the second solvent cavity. Compared to the N84L mutant, the Ala84 side chain has lost this hydrogen bond but does not fill the cavity. The 12% decrease in the activity of N84L as compared to N84A is probably due to this steric hindrance. In the native structure, the tetracoordinated water molecule W531 stabilizes Asn84 O1 in a single position despite the double position of Asn84 N2. It was particularly interesting to note that W531 is located at the bottom of the deepest and most narrow crevice of cutinase (diameter of 3.01 Å and depth of 5.71 Å). This water molecule is present in all the mutant structures. The residual activities of mutants N84A and N84L are quite appreciable: N84A still retains 26.5% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme, whereas N84L retains only 3.0% (Table 1). This catalytic behavior of the N84L mutant is quite surprising, since it is also due to a decrease in kcat and not to an increase in the KM, which remains constant. This rules out the possibility that the mutation may have steric

effects on the substrate docking. The overall kinetic effect may therefore be due to the sum of numerous small changes on the structure and dynamics of the active site as a whole. N84D. Mutation Asn84 in Asp84 results in the introduction of a negative charge into the oxyanion hole pocket. Since Asn and Asp are isosteric, neither steric clashes nor cavity formation are liable to complicate the interpretation of the

kinetic results. Despite this isostericity, mutant N84D is the only one that crystallizes in a different space group: this is probably due to the electrostatic effects of the mutation on the crystal packing. This effect has often been noted with cutinase mutants having charge differences (S. Longhi and A. Nicolas, unpublished results). The negative charge introduced by Asp into the active site pocket induces different

stereochemical changes in its vicinity, together with a movement of the Arg208 side chain from a symmetry-related molecule toward the active site (Figure 4). The symmetryrelated Arg208 side chain is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds with Tyr119 OH and with the active site water molecule W529, which itself is hydrogen-bonded to Ser120 O. The symmetry-related C-terminal helix (Glu201 to Ser213) and a -turn (Ser57 to Ala62) are consequently located close to three loops (Thr43 to Thr45, Leu81 to Gly89, Ile183 to Leu189) surrounding the active site. The overall structural modifications observed result mainly from the new crystallographic packing. Concerning the active site residues, Ser42 O establishes hydrogen bonds with Asp84 O2 and Asp84 O1. In the native cutinase, Ser42 O plays the role of the acceptor for the hydrogen bond with Asn84 N2 and donor for the hydrogen bond with the oxyanion. In the crystallization and activity measurement buffers (pH 7 and 9, respectively), Asp84 side chain is deprotonated. Ser42 O therefore becomes the donor in a very tight hydrogen bond with Asp84 O2 (2.5 Å), indicating that Ser42 O hydrogen is not available for oxyanion stabilization (Figure 3D). The

hydrogen bond established between Ser42 O side chain and Gln121 N 2 is weaker (3.2 Å) than that between Ser42 O side chain and Asn84 O2. The shift of Ser42 O leads to the shift of the loop Thr 43 to Thr45. The catalytic Ser120 O is shifted 1.44 Å as compared with the wild-type enzyme and forms a hydrogen bond with Ser42 NH and symmetrical Arg208 N 2 via the water molecule W529. The shift of Ser120 O results from the introduction of Arg208 into the active site. Although the geometry of the oxyanion hole main chain NH groups remains intact, the catalytic triad geometry is severely disturbed, since Ser120 O is located 3.89 Å from His188 N2 (Table 4). The narrow bridge involving Leu81 with Val184 no longer exists, so that there exists a continuum between the two solvent-accessible pockets of the active site crevice, where three water molecules become visible. Leu81 displays the most striking shift as compared with the position in the native enzyme, in which Leu81 O is hydrogen-bound to Asn84 N2. In the mutant N84D, Asp84 O2 generates a repulsive effect toward Leu81 carbonyl oxygen, resulting in a 180° rotation of its main chain. Consequently, Leu81 NH also rotates through 180° and establishes a hydrogen bond with a symmetry

related Glu201 O 2 atom. Water molecule W529 is shifted from its original position, near the inhibitor (P)-O3 oxygen position, at the bottom of the catalytic crevice, to a new position close to the water molecule W860 observed in the structure of mutants N84A and S42A. It displays the same hydrogen bond network as water molecule W860, being in contact with Ser120 O (2.62 Å), His188 N 2 (2.79 Å), and W866. As may be expected in the case of such drastic structural changes, the catalytic activity is greatly reduced using pnpbutyrate, to only 0.13% relative to that observed with the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). The large decrease in kcat supports the idea that an electrostatic destabilization of the transition state may be introduced by the charge modification into the oxyanion hole pocket. N84W. In the closed conformations of RmL and Human pancreatic lipase (HPL), a Trp residue belonging to the lid blocks the accessibility of the active serine. This Trp moves when the substrate binding occurs, following the movement of the lid. Replacing Asn84 in cutinase by a Trp restores the steric features observed in the closed form of these two lipases. This mutation was investigated in an attempt to induce a structural rearrangement of the enzyme, mimicking the structural rearrangements which occur in response to the interfacial activation of lipases. No such rearrangement was obtained, however, either structurally or kinetically. As can be seen from Figure 3E, Trp84 entirely fills the second solvent-accessible pocket. Hydrophobic interactions occur with Leu81 and Leu182, which stabilize the Trp ring in its orientation, as the result of which the active serine is completely hidden and the water molecule, which is normally bond to O, is moved from the bottom to the top of the pocket; a second water molecule, W902, stabilizes Ser120 O. In the second shell of interactions, the hydrogen bond between Ser42 O and Gln121 N 2 is the only stabilizating

interaction which is conserved. The conformation of the catalytic triad and that of the oxyanion hole components are conserved, however (Tables 3 and 4). Water molecule W529 displays the same behavior as in the N84D mutant and is in contact with Ser120 O (3.07 Å), His188 N 2 (3.18 Å), and W664. This mutation leads to a residual catalytic activity of 0.11%, the lowest obtained among all the variants studied so far (Table 1). Kinetic experiments performed on C3 and C4 triglycerides (A. Nicolas, unpublished results) showed the occurrence of a dramatic decrease in activity, working from the C3 to the C4 alkyl chain length substrates. This suggests that no structural rearrangement is possible in the vicinity of the cutinase active site crevice, but that the N84W cutinase can accommodate very small C3 substrates and still be active on them. This result confirms without any doubt that acute steric hindrance is exerted toward the substrate by the Trp mutation. DISCUSSION Among the nucleophile-His-Asp (Glu) proteases, trypsin (Stroud et al., 1974), chymotrypsin (Blow, 1976), and Streptomyces griseus proteinase A (Blanchard & James, 1994), a chymotrypsin-like enzyme, the oxyanion is stabilized by two main chain nitrogen groups, while in subtilisin (Steinmetz et al., 1994) and papain (Schoder et al., 1993) ¨ one of the nitrogen groups comes from the main chain and the other from a side chain (Table 5). Proteases have their triad in the opposite handedness to that of lipases. Consequently, this change reverses the direction of the polypeptide backbone around the His and Ser residues. The amide NH oxyanion component of the nucleophile residue in proteases becomes equivalent to the amide NH of the following residue in lipases. It can be noted that, in serine carboxypeptidases alone among all the proteases, the first NH has the same

feature as that observed in lipases (Liao & Remington, 1990). In all the known esterase structures, acetylcholinesterase (Sussman et al., 1991), and Streptomyces scabies esterase (Wei et al., 1995), and in Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) (Grochulski et al., 1994), which is the lipase structurally homologous with acetylcholine, three amide groups stabilize the oxyanion hole, namely, three main chain groups and two main chain groups with a side chain group, respectively (Table 5). Up to now, among those lipases the threedimensional structure (except CRL) of which is known in their inhibited form, two schemes of oxyanion stabilization have been found to exist (Table 5). Both cases show a common hydrogen bonding network arising from two main chain nitrogen groups. In HPL (Egloff et al., 1995), horse pancreatic lipase (Bourne et al., 1994), and Pseudomonas glumae lipase (Noble et al., 1994), the oxyanion stabilization components belong to this first scheme. In the second scheme, a third hydrogen bond occurs through a serine or threonine side chain hydroxyl group. The serine O component is present in Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RmL) (Brzozowski et al., 1991), Penicillium camembertii lipase (PcL) (Derewenda et al., 1994; Yamaguchi et al., 1992), Humicola lanuginosa lipase (HlL) (Derewenda et al., 1994), and cutinase (Martinez et al., 1994); the threonine hydroxyl group is present in Rhizopus delemar lipase (RdL) (Derewenda et al., 1994; Joerger & Haas, 1994) and Candida antartica B (CaBL) (Uppenberg et al., 1994). The reason why serine and cysteine proteases require two amide groups, whereas esterases and CRL require three amide groups, some lipases require two amide groups, and other lipases require two amide groups and a hydroxyl group in the oxyanion hole is puzzling. Four hydrolases have been investigated to date by performing site-directed mutagenesis to study kinetically the importance of a side chain residue involved in the oxyanion hole stabilization. In the serine protease subtilisin BPN, the mutation of Asn155 into Leu (Bryan et al., 1986) resulted in a decrease in the kcat toward peptidyl substrate. In the cysteine protease papain, the mutations of Gln19 into Ala or Ser (Menard et al., 1991) resulted in the decrease of ´ kcat toward CBZ-Phe-Arg-MCA, a peptidyl substrate. In

cutinase, mutation Ser42 into Ala also has a marked effect on the kcat but causes only minor changes on the Michaelis constant. In RdL, mutations of Thr83 into Ala or Ser (Joerger & Haas, 1994) and, in PcL, the mutation of Ser84 into Gly (Yamaguchi et al., 1992) lead to a decrease in the specific activity toward several triglyceridyl substrates. The present study is the first attempt made so far to analyze the effects of the mutations on the three-dimensional structures of the oxyanion hole compounds from the kinetic point of view. The finding that the cutinase mutation S42A drastically reduces the enzyme activity demonstrates that Ser42 O plays an essential role in stabilizing the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate. The loss of transition state binding free energy, Gq, due to a site-directed mutation, can be calculated from the kinetic constants, kcat and KM, using the equation Gq ) -RT ln[(kcat/KM)mutant/ (kcat/KM)wild-type] (Fersht et al., 1985). Using this equation, the hydrogen bond of Ser42 O with the oxyanion contributes about 3.3 kcal mol-1 to the stabilization of the transition state. The Asn155 side chain in subtilisin, Gln19 in papain, and Gln195 in tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase are also involved in the stabilization of an oxyanion in the transition state. The loss of transition state binding free energy is in the range 2.2-4.8 kcal mol-1 in the case of the subtilisin variants N155X (Bryan et al., 1986; Wells et al., 1986; Rao et al., 1987; Carter & Wells, 1990), 2.4-3.8 kcal.mol-1 in that of the papain variants Q19X (Menard et al., 1991), and 3-6 ´ kcal mol-1 in that of the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase variants Q195X (Fersht et al., 1985). It has been suggested by Fersht (Fersht et al., 1985) that if a hydrogen bond deletion occurs between a side chain and a charged group on the substrate, the binding free energy changes will be within the 3-6 kcal mol-1 range. With the subtilisin, papain, and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase variants as well as with the cutinase S42A variant, the loss of the hydrogen bond due to the mutation involves a charged group of the substrate (C-O-), which is present in the transition state, and the values observed are within the range proposed by Fersht. Table 6 gives, for cutinase, subtilisin, and papain, the kinetic parameters observed upon mutating into an alanine

residues stabilizing the substrate oxyanion in the transition state. The residual activity and the loss of transition state binding free energy were found to be quite similar between subtilisin mutant N155A and cutinase mutant S42A. With the papain mutant Q19A, the value of the residual activity

was higher and the loss of transition state binding free energy was lower than those observed with mutants S42A and N155A. These kinetic differences cannot have been attributable to structural differences between the mutants S42A, Q19A, and N155A analyzed through (i) the nature of the

Characterization of the Cutinase Oxyanion Hole lost side chain stabilizing the oxyanion, (ii) the size of the side chain fragment removed, and (iii) the number of hydrogen bonds that continue to stabilize the oxyanion. In both subtilisin and papain, the side chain group involved in the stabilization of the oxyanion is an amide group, whereas in cutinase it is a hydroxyl group. In mutants N155A and Q19A, the size of the fragments removed, CONH2 and CH2CONH2, respectively, are quite similar, whereas, in the S42A mutant, this fragment, an OH, is clearly smaller than those of mutants N155A and Q19A. In N155A and Q19A mutants, only one hydrogen bond remains to stabilize the oxyanion, whereas, in the S42A mutant, two hydrogen bonds are left. It therefore seems likely that mutants N155A and Q19A are most similar from the structural point of view, whereas, from the point of view of kinetics, the similarity was observed between mutants N155A and S42A. Menard ´ et al. (1991) have suggested that the difference observed between the kinetic parameters of mutants N155A and Q19A may reflect the fact that the extent of transition state stabilization achieved through the oxyanion hole of papain, although highly significant, is somewhat smaller than that achieved through a comparable interaction in subtilisin. Cutinase mutations N84W, N84L, and N84A disrupt the hydrogen bond stabilization of Asn84 N2 with Ser42 O and modify the steric environment in the active site pocket. The activity on pnp-butyrate is reduced to 0.11% in the Trp mutant as compared with the wild-type enzyme and remains at 3% and 26.5% with Leu and Ala mutants, respectively. As the result of these three mutations with nonpolar residues, the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole geometry remain unchanged. Gln121 superimposes with the wild-type enzyme and maintains Ser42 O in the appropriate orientation to be properly oriented in the oxyanion stabilization. The fact that mutation N84W leads to the lowest residual activity as compared with the wild type confirms that the steric increase introduced by the Trp ring blocks the access to the active site as far as the medium sized (C4) ester substrates, but not the smallest ones, are concerned (C3). The introduction of a net negative charge into the oxyanion hole pocket resulting from the N84D mutation modifies the hydrogen bonding network in the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole. The hydrogen bond stabilization of the oxyanion with Ser42 O and Ser120 O with His188 N 2 is disrupted. The activity on pnp-butyrate is reduced to 0.13% as compared with that of the wild-type enzyme, which is similar to what occurs with the N84W mutant. Asn84 appears to play a significant role in the electrostatic stabilization of the active site pocket but seems not to be absolutely essential because mutants Asn84Leu and Asn84Ala continue to have some esterase activity. Asn84 does show a change in the kcat but only minor changes in the Michaelis constant. With a view to determining whether or not the geometry of the cutinase oxyanion hole can be taken to apply in the case of other lipases, we performed structural comparisons among several lipases. In some lipases, the second oxyanion hole nitrogen component becomes properly positioned only after a conformational change. Upon superimposing the catalytic triad and the two oxyanion hole main chain NH groups of the open form of lipases mentioned in the introduction (data not shown), an excellent structural fit was observed between them. Only a few of them have a hydroxyl group on the second residue of the oxyanion hole, however, namely, RmL and the homologous RdL, PcL and HlL, CaBL

Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1996 409 and cutinase. The three dimensional structure of cutinaseE600 complex (Martinez et al., 1994) was superimposed on that of the RmL-n-hexylphosphonate ethyl ester complex (RmL-C6) (Brzozowski et al., 1991) and on that of CaBL (Uppenberg, 1994) using the rigid body option of the TURBO software program (Roussel & Cambillau, 1991). In RmL, the second oxyanion NH component is Ser82, located within the lid hinge. In CaBL, Thr40 NH is already in a suitable conformation for catalytic activity to occur, since this lipase shares with cutinase the property of having an open active site. Superimposing the oxyanion hole components (Ser42 N, Gln121 N, and Ser42 O) of cutinase onto structurally corresponding atom positions in RmL and CaBL gives root mean square deviations of 0.23 and 0.09 Å, respectively. Residue Thr40 of CaBL has not yet been studied yet, but the oxyanion hole geometry is the most similar so far to that of cutinase and has the same three interaction shells (Figure 5A). The role of RmL Ser82 O in stabilizing the oxyanion hole can be inferred from the results obtained on mutants RdL Thr83 (Joerger & Hass, 1994) and mutants PcL Ser84 (Yamaguchi et al., 1992) since these residues are homologous to RmL Ser82 (Derewenda, 1994). The results of our kinetic experiments and structural analysis of these cutinase mutants provide new evidence supporting the idea that Ser42 O is an extra component of the cutinase oxyanion hole, acting in combination with the two main chain nitrogen atoms 42 and 121. The reason why cutinase and some lipases need three hydrogen bonds to stabilize the oxyanion, while subtilisin and other lipases need only two, still remains to be elucidated, however. REFERENCES
