Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase) is a model enzyme for understanding allosteric effects. The dodecameric complex exists in two main states (T and R) that differ substantially in their quaternary structure and their affinity for various ligands. Many hypotheses have resulted from the structure of the Escherichia coli ATCase, but so far other crystal structures to test these have been lacking. Here, we present the tertiary and quaternary structure of the T state ATCase of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (SaATCT), determined by X-ray crystallo° graphy to 2.6 A resolution. The quaternary structure differs from the E. coli ATCase, by having altered interfaces between the catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits, and the presence of a novel C1 ­R2 type interface. Conformational differences in the 240s loop region of the C chain and the C-terminal region of the R chain affect intersubunit and interdomain interfaces implicated previously in the allosteric behavior of E. coli ATCase. The allosteric-zinc binding domain interface is strengthened at the expense of a weakened R1 ­ C4 type interface. The increased hydrophobicity of the C1 ­ R1 type interface may stabilize the quaternary structure. Catalytic trimers of the S. acidocaldarius ATCase are unstable due to a drastic weakening of the C1 ­ C2 interface. The hyperthermophilic ATCase presents an interesting example of how an allosteric enzyme can adapt to higher temperatures. The structural rearrangement of this thermophilic ATCase may well promote its thermal stability at the expense of changes in the allosteric behavior.

2.1.3.2) catalyzes the formation of phosphate and N-carbamoyl-L -aspartate from carbamoyl phosphate and L -aspartate, initiating the first step in the synthesis of pyrimidines.1,2 ATCase is extensively studied as a model for structure­function relationships in cooperativity and allosteric regulation mechanisms. The structure and properties of the Escherichia coli enzyme have been studied in detail.3 ­ 8 This dodecameric enzyme is composed of two types of polypeptide chains: the 34 kDa catalytic chains (c) encoded by the pyrB gene, and the 17 kDa regulatory chains (r) encoded by the pyrI gene.9 ­ 11 The quaternary structure of this enzyme results from the association of two catalytic chain trimers (c3) held together through their interactions with three regulatory chain dimers (r2).

types consist of two domains, carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate binding domains in the case of the catalytic chains and allosteric and zinc (Zn) domains in the case of the regulatory chains. The catalytic sites are located at the interface between two catalytic chains belonging to the same trimer and involve residues belonging to both chains.12,13 The allosteric domain contains the binding site for nucleotide effectors and the zinc binding domain makes contacts with the catalytic subunits. E. coli ATCase shows positive homotropic interactions between catalytic sites for binding of the substrate L -aspartate, a phenomenon which is explained by the transition from a T state (referred to as EcATCT) having a low affinity for aspartate to an R state (EcATCR) with a high affinity for this substrate. The crystal structures of these two ° extreme conformations have been solved at 2.6 A ° resolution, respectively.14,15 Analysis of and 2.1 A these structures indicates that the holoenzyme undergoes substantial conformational changes upon T ­R transition. Changes at the quaternary ° level include an expansion by 12 A along the molecular 3-fold axis, along with rotations of the catalytic subunits about the 3-fold axis and rotations of the regulatory subunits about their respective 2-fold axes. Changes at the tertiary level include the closure of the aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate domains to form the active site, as well as the rearrangement of the 80s and 240s loop regions. The enzyme also exhibits heterotropic interactions between catalytic and regulatory sites. Its activity is synergistically feedback inhibited by the two end products CTP and UTP, and is stimulated by ATP. These effectors bind to the same regulatory sites, at a distance of ° 60 A from the catalytic sites.16 The enzymatic properties of the ATCase from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, a thermoacidophilic archaeon of the Crenarchaeota group, were investigated previously.17 This enzyme was shown to be highly thermostable and to display cooperativity between catalytic sites for the binding of its substrate aspartate. It exhibits, however, a very different regulation pattern: the holoenzyme is strongly activated by all nucleoside triphosphates, while E. coli ATCase is inhibited by pyrimidine nucleotides and activated only by ATP. It was shown furthermore that, in contrast to E. coli and other hyperthermophilic ATCases,18,19 the catalytic trimer is not intrinsically stable and the stability of the enzyme is achieved by the association of the catalytic and the regulatory subunits. ° ° Previously, 3.5 A and 1.8 A resolution structures of the catalytic trimer of Methanococcus jannaschii and Pyrococcus abyssi ATCase were described,20,21 but the structure of a complete dodecameric enzyme to test the hypotheses from the E. coli ATCase has been lacking. We now report the first hyperthermophilic ATCase structure of the intact ° (unliganded) holoenzyme ([2c3 : 3r2]) at 2.6 A resolution. We compare the tertiary and quaternary structure with the EcATCT and EcATCR structures

in terms of the overall architecture and possible implications for its high thermostability. Special attention was given to the different interfaces between the different subunits because of their important role in the allosteric behavior and the thermostability of this enzyme.

Results
Overall structure The catalytic and regulatory monomers of the S. acidocaldarius ATCase form a dodecamer with D3 point group symmetry. The enzyme crystallizes in space group P6322 with one catalytic and one regulatory subunit in the asymmetric unit. The heterododecameric complex (Figure 1(a)) is generated by the crystallographic symmetry operators of the P6322 space group, resulting in two dodecameric enzymes per unit cell. The statistics of the structure determination can be found in Table 1. The overall quaternary structure resembles that of a T state ATCase.12 We will therefore refer to this structure as SaATCT.

Catalytic monomer structure The SaATCT catalytic subunit has 299 residues and shares 43% sequence identity with the E. coli ATCase catalytic subunit. It is composed of two domains: the carbamoyl phosphate domain (or

polar domain) and the aspartate domain (or equatorial domain), linked by two a-helices. Each domain consists of a b-sheet of five parallel strands surrounded by a-helices (Figure 1(b)). Superposition leads to root-mean-square deviation ° ° (rmsd) values of 1.4 A for EcATCR and 1.6 A for a EcATCT (based on 272 C atoms of Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries 1D09 and 6AT1, respectively). The similarity with EcATCR is mainly due to several a-helical regions (helix numbers a1 ­ 7). Furthermore, the polar and equatorial domains of the SaATCT catalytic chain are in closer contact compared to the E. coli T state. This is illustrated by the total number of interdomain ion pairs and hydrogen bonds, the S. acidocaldarius ATCase totaling 14 of them, E. coli T state only ten. More specifically, the E50 ­R167 and E50 ­R234 salt bridges are characteristic and necessary interactions for the E. coli R state.22,23 In SaATCT the first ion pair is present (E47 ­ R162), indicating yet another agreement with EcATCR. The region that undergoes the largest changes upon the T to R transition in E. coli, namely the 240s loop region, is closer to the E. coli T state (Figure 2(a)). In region 227 ­ 233 an extra Val is inserted (V228), and maximal distances between Ca atoms of T state S. acidocaldarius and E. coli T ° ° and R state ATCase of 2.3 A and 11.8 A, respectively, are found. In region 236 ­238 the ° ° maximal distances are 7.7 A and 5.0 A. Other important differences between the S. acidocaldarius and E. coli Ca traces can be found mostly at the surface of the monomer. The N-terminal region 7 ­43 shows considerable differences with the corresponding region of the E. coli ° enzyme. Helix a1 is shifted about 2 A along its longitudinal axis. Loop region 33 ­37 (residues ° 36­ 41 in E. coli) has moved 1.5 A away from its position at the C1 ­ C2 interface in E. coli. The E37(C1) ­K40(C2) salt bridge interaction between the catalytic subunits in the E. coli ATCase is thereby absent. Loop region 175 ­177 (residues 180­ 182 in E. coli) has a different conformation in S. acidocaldarius. An equivalent of the R17 ­D180 interdomain salt link of E. coli ATCase is absent. The recently determined structure of the P. abyssi ATCase catalytic subunit in complex with PALA was found to be very similar to the E. coli R state ° catalytic subunit (rmsd 1.2 A, based on 301 Ca atoms), except for the 240s region and the same a1-helical region.21 Apart from this region, the S. acidocaldarius catalytic subunit shows more similarity with the P. abyssi catalytic subunit than with that from E. coli in regions 110 ­ 116, 202 ­ 212 and 269­ 272. All important active site residues of E. coli ATCase15,24 are conserved in S. acidocaldarius. Most of them show good positional agreement. Exceptions are R221 and Q223, which are located further away from the active site (Figure 3). Since they move closer to the active site on forming the high affinity, high activity R state in E. coli, one could expect a larger conformational change taking

place in S. acidocaldarius ATCase. However, the positioning of residue K126 of SaATCT is not compatible with the large displacement of R234 seen in E. coli ATCase.

Regulatory monomer structure The SaATCT regulatory subunit has 164 residues and shares 30% sequence identity with the E. coli ATCase regulatory subunit and consists mainly of b-sheets (Figure 1(c)). It is composed of an N-terminal allosteric domain (effector-binding domain) and a C-terminal Zn-binding domain. The core of each domain consists of an anti-parallel b-sheet with five and four b-strands, respectively. The Zn ion is coordinated by four Cys residues. ° Superposition leads to rmsd values of 1.7 A for ° for EcATCR (based on 142 Ca EcATCT and 2.0 A atoms of PDB entries 6AT1 and 1D09, respectively), showing that, in contrast with the catalytic chain, the regulatory subunit resembles more EcATCT. The largest differences are situated in loop regions at the surface of the molecule and in a prolonged ° C-terminal helix which is shifted 4 A towards the allosteric domain (Figure 2(b)). The effector binding sites are well preserved between the two enzymes14,17 (Figure 4). Although not directly involved in effector binding, residues 52 ­56 of E. coli (50s loop) define portions of the triphosphate and ribose subsites of the nucleotide binding site. The 50s loop changes conformation upon T to R transition and has been put forward as one of the ways in which the effector binding sites are coupled to the allosteric-Zn domain

Quaternary structure The S. acidocaldarius ATCase has the subunit composition [2c3 : 3r2] (Figure 1(a)). The catalytic subunits are arranged as two sets of trimers (c3) in complex with three sets of regulatory dimers (r2). ° The dimension along the 3-fold axis is 6 A longer ° than for EcATCT and 6 A shorter than for EcATCR. Despite the various resemblances between the SaATCT and EcATCR, the overall subunit orientation is in good agreement with EcATCT, so we can confidently consider the structure presented as a T state ATCase (Figure 5). Upon comparison of the subunit interfaces, SaATCT has six extra C1 ­R2 types of interface, never observed in either EcATCR or EcATCT.12 All other interfaces previously described in E. coli are still present, but important deviations occur. What follows is a detailed description of the various types of interfaces. For the nomenclature of the interfaces, see Figure 1(a). C1 ­ R2 type interfaces A unique feature of the S. acidocaldarius ATCase is the presence of a C1 ­R2 type interface. The surface area buried in it is small (Table 2) and polar because of a salt bridge between residues R268(C1) and E125(R2). This salt link is part of an extensive ionic network of six residues, involved in 13 salt links and located in three interfaces (C1 ­C2; C1 ­ R1; C1 ­ R2, see Figure 6). C1 ­ C2 type interfaces This type of interface, which connects two catalytic subunits from one trimer, contains the catalytic site and involves both the aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate binding domains of one monomer and the 80s loop of the adjacent catalytic monomer. In comparison with EcATCT and EcATCR, the surface area buried in this interface is about 28% smaller (Table 2). In this calculation we took the flexible region encompassing residues 74 ­80 into account. This large difference can in part be attributed to the different conformation of the loop region following helix a1. While the EcATCR C1 ­ C2 interface has fewer (14) polar interactions (salt bridges and hydrogen bonds) than EcATCT (19), SaATCT has only seven. However, five of these interactions are part of a six-residue ion pair network (Figure 6), whereas in E. coli, only a three-residue network is found here. It has been observed that the same network is

extended to four residues in the P. abyssi ATCase structure.21 C1 ­ R1 type interfaces Most of the interactions between the catalytic and regulatory chains occur at the C1 ­ R1 type interface, which is mainly composed of carbamoyl phosphate and Zn-binding domain regions. The amount of surface area buried in this interface is almost equal to that of EcATCT; the hydrophobic content of this area is 18% higher (Table 2). Four aromatic residues (Y104(C), F110(C), Y117(R) and Y144(R)) are present in the SaATCT interface, compared to only one (Y140(R)) in EcATCT. In contrast to a previous modeling study17 in which fewer polar interactions were inferred in the C1 ­ R1 interface, a total of 14 polar interactions was found compared with 12 of these in EcATCT. The unique R state interactions between Zn-binding and aspartate binding domains are absent from the SaATCT

The C1 ­C4 type interface in E. coli ATCase is a small interaction area that undergoes drastic changes upon the T to R transition and has major influence on the stability of the T and R state.26 ­ 28 Although structurally more comparable to EcATCT than to EcATCR, SaATCT shows a different organization. Large conformational differences are known to occur in the 240s loop region, which contains residues important in stabilizing EcATCT. The E. coli E239(C1) ­ K164(C4) and E239(C1) ­ Y165(C4) interactions are replaced in S. acidocaldarius by D229(C1) ­R190(C4) interactions (Figure 5). While residues E239 and D229 are located at almost equivalent positions, residues K164 (K159 in S. acidocaldarius) and R190 are not positionally related. There is, however, a structural connection between the regions that contain residues K159 and R190, namely a hydrogen bond between the main-chain atoms of L158 and L187 and a threeresidue ionic network between R169, E192 and E196, not present in EcATCT/R.

R1 ­ C4 type interfaces The R1 ­C4 interface is observed in EcATCT, but not in EcATCR. It is considered important in stabilizing the T state.29 The R1 ­ C4 type interface is also present in SaATCT but it is about 50% smaller (Table 2) and the number of apolar van der Waals contacts is reduced. An important salt bridge in EcATCT (D236(C4) ­ K143(R1)) links the 240s loop region with the C-terminal region of the regulatory chain.29,30 This salt bridge, as well as other polar interactions, is absent from this interface (Figure 5). Analysis of thermostability Amino acid composition Of the 20 amino acids, the residues Asn, Gln, Met and Cys can be classified as thermolabile due to their tendency to undergo deamidation or oxidation at high temperatures.31 A comparison of the amino acid composition of S. acidocaldarius and E. coli ATCase shows that only Gln occurs significantly less in the thermostable ATCase. As reported for the P. abyssi catalytic chain,21 more charged residues are found in S. acidocaldarius ATCase, especially residues Lys and Glu. In accordance with the general tendency,32 most of these extra charges are found at the surface of SaATCT. The catalytic chain has significantly more Tyr residues. As discussed above, several of them are found in the C1 ­R1 type interface of SaATCT. Although Pro is known to potentially hamper thermal unfolding by conferring more rigidity to surface loops,33 ­ 35 there are no important differences in proline content between the two enzymes. Secondary structure elements A small difference in a-helical content can be found for the regulatory subunits (Table 3). This higher a-helical content can be attributed to the extended C-terminal helix. In the catalytic monomers there are only small local differences in secondary structure. a-Helix distortion can be a factor in protein stability,36 e.g. the presence of proline residues or b-branched residues (Val, Ile, Leu) can distort a-helix geometry. The numbers of these residues present in a-helices are comparable in E. coli and S. acidocaldarius. Helix dipole stabilization does not seem to be responsible for the higher thermal stability of S. acidocaldarius ATCase either. Loops and N and C termini are usually the regions with the highest thermal factors in a protein crystal structure and it has been stated that they are likely to unfold first during thermal denaturation.37 In the SaATCT catalytic chain, the N and C-terminal regions (located on the surface of the molecule), are six and four residues shorter, respectively, than in E. coli. The N and C-terminal regions of the regulatory chain are three and six residues shorter in E. coli. In contrast to the P. abyssi

Nevertheless, closer examination reveals that the cavity cited above is absent from P. abyssi ATCase (its Y248 side-chain is pointing into the cavity). The second cavity mentioned is lined by the residues that form the typical interactions of the C1 ­C4 interface in EcATCT. Due to the altered C1 ­ C4 interface in SaATCT, this cavity is absent.

Hydrogen bonds, ion pairs and aromatic interactions The total number of hydrogen bonds of the S. acidocaldarius and E. coli ATCase is not significantly different. Whereas the regulatory subunits contain an equal number of ion pairs, the catalytic subunits contain twice as many ion pairs26 compared to EcATCT,14 but still significantly less than EcATCR.31 More important, however, is the presence of ion pair networks.38,39 In the SaATCT dodecamer, 68% of the salt links are part of ion pair networks, in contrast with only 19% for EcATCT and 59% for EcATCR. Five interacting aromatic pairs are detected in the SaATCT catalytic monomer. In comparison, the EcATCT and EcATCR and P. abyssi catalytic subunits contain two and four aromatic pairs, respectively (Table 3). Accessible surface area (ASA) A detailed comparison of the buried (total and apolar) surface areas of the different subunit interfaces can be found in Table 2. In order to obtain a better estimate of the degree of interaction between the domains within each subunit, an approximating calculation of the buried surface area between the domains was made. The result points out that the aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate domains have a more intimate contact compared to E. coli T state ATCase. Furthermore, the S. acidocaldarius ATCase has 19% more buried apolar surface area between its regulatory chain domains than the unliganded E. coli ATCase. This can be attributed to the extended C-terminal helix interacting with the allosteric domain instead of the R1 ­ C4 type interface. The intimate contact between the allosteric and Zn-binding domains is further emphasized by the average crystallographic B-factors, which are more comparable for the two ° ° domains in SaATCT (32.4 A2 and 28.3 A2 compared ° ° to 45.9 A2 and 26.5 A2 for EcATCT).

Discussion
In a previous study17 the kinetic behavior of S. acidocaldarius ATCase, including Michaelian saturation kinetics for carbamoyl phosphate and homotropic cooperative interactions for aspartate, was found to be similar to that of the E. coli ATCase. In E. coli ATCase, two main structural and functional states are generally accepted to be present: a low affinity, low activity T state (EcATCT) and a high affinity, high activity R state (EcATCR).40 Based upon the overall quaternary structure and the absence of ligands known to induce the R state, the crystal structure of the unliganded ATCase of S. acidocaldarius described here is thought to represent the functional T state of SaATCT. Comparison of the SaATCT and EcATCT struc-

tures shows that their quaternary organization is similar, i.e. [2c3 : 3r2]. Important structural differences occur in the N-terminal and 240s regions of the catalytic chains and the C-terminal region of the regulatory chains. The differences in the N-terminal region of the former chains are partially responsible for the weakening of the interactions between the subunits within the catalytic trimers (c3), explaining why S. acidocaldarius ATCase catalytic chains mostly remain monomeric in the absence of regulatory chains. This distinguishes the enzyme from the E. coli ATCase. A considerable transition to the trimeric state is observed in the presence of carbamoyl phosphate.17 In our crystal structure the 80s loop could not be modeled due to a lack of electron density. Possibly, carbamoyl phosphate can move the 80s loop in an active conformation at the interface between monomers, thus stabilizing the monomer ­ monomer interactions. Upon the T to R state transition in E. coli, the two domains of the catalytic chains move closer to each other, bringing the active site residues in their high affinity, high activity conformation. It has been shown for E. coli ATCase that weakening of the C1 ­ C2 type interface promotes this domain closure.41 The C1­C2 type interface is weakened in the SaATCT structure, bringing the two domains closer to each other. Therefore, even though the overall quaternary structure is consistent with a T state ATCase, the SaATCT catalytic chain conformation is intermediate between EcATCT and EcATCR. Large conformational differences between the 240s regions of S. acidocaldarius and E. coli ATCase have marked effects on the C1 ­C4 and R1 ­C4 type interfaces. It has been proposed that because of steric hindrance, domain closure in one catalytic chain in E. coli cannot occur without some change in the quaternary structure of the enzyme,6 making the elongation of the enzyme a necessary feature of the allosteric transition. This elongation requires the breaking of the T state intersubunit interactions involving D236(C) and E239(C). When the sidechain of either of these residues is replaced by uncharged substitutes, the net results are the inability of the E. coli enzyme to exist in the T state, and the formation of a new structural state that is neither T nor R.27 In SaATCT the important interactions E239(C1)­K164(C4), E239(C1) ­ Y165(C4) and D236(C4)­ K143(R1) are absent and although a shift can be seen at the C1 ­ C4 type interfaces towards the E. coli R state, the S. acidocaldarius holoenzyme still shows homotropic cooperativity between the catalytic sites, which can be explained by the existence of two distinct functional states. The unique D229(C1) ­ R190(C4) salt bridges therefore are likely to be major contributors to the stabilization of the low affinity, low activity state of S. acidocaldarius ATCase. A unique feature observed in this crystal structure is the existence of a C1 ­R2 type of interface which is a potentially stabilizing factor for the T state of S. acidocaldarius ATCase. An extensive ion pair network connects

this novel interface with three other interface types (C1 ­ C2, C1 ­ R1 and C1 ­ R2). The R1­C4 type of interface is important for homotropic cooperativity in E. coli ATCase.29,30 More specifically, it is thought that the intersubunit link involving D236(C) is important for the stabilization of the 240s loop in its tight-state position. In SaATCT, this link is not present due to structural changes in the C-terminal region of the regulatory chain. This may again explain why the 240s loop in SaATCT cannot be held in the same position as in EcATCT, and why the catalytic chain domains are located closer to each other in the unliganded enzyme. Although similar in kinetic behavior, S. acidocaldarius ATCase exhibits a different regulation pattern compared to the E. coli enzyme. All nucleoside triphosphate effectors activate the Sulfolobus holoenzyme, whereas E. coli ATCase is synergistically feedback inhibited by the end products CTP and UTP, and activated only by ATP.42 ­ 45 Studies on hybrid enzymes built from regulatory and catalytic polypeptides of ATCases with divergent functional characteristics established that the regulatory subunits determine the type of allosteric regulatory properties exhibited by the holoenzyme.46 ­ 50 For a signal to propagate from the nucleotide binding site to the active site, it must pass through different interfaces. Mutagenesis studies have assessed the importance of different regions in these interfaces in the modulation of the heterotropic effects, but no clear signal transduction pathways have been described.51 ­ 55 When comparing the structures of SaATCT and EcATCT/R, considerable differences are found in all of these regions, especially in the allosteric-zinc domain interface and the contact regions between the regulatory and catalytic chains (C1 ­ R1 and R1 ­ C4 type interfaces). It has been described that replacing D236(C) with an alanine in E. coli ATCase results in the elimination of heterotropic interactions, which suggests that the D236(C) ­K143(R) interaction at the R1 ­C4 interface may function to transmit heterotropic signals.29 Furthermore, it has been suggested that the interactions between residues 146 to 149 of the regulatory chain and the 240s loop region of the catalytic chain might be important in the modulation of the ATP effect.51,52 Since these interactions are weakened or lost in SaATCT, important differences in effector signaling pathways are to be expected. Especially, the novel C1 ­ R2 type interface could have an important role. Any direct signal from the nucleotide binding site to the active site must pass through the allostericzinc domain interface. In SaATCT and EcATCT, different residues are interacting in this mainly hydrophobic interface. A particular deletion mutant of E. coli ATCase (rD[152­153]) is not inhibited by CTP, and it has been suggested that this is due to the formation of a new intrachain interaction between the C-terminal region and the allosteric domain of the regulatory chain. CTP could thus inhibit the reorientation of the two domains of the regulatory chain that allows the formation of this

interaction. In the mutant, the effect of CTP would be pre-empted as a result of the deletion.52,56,57 In SaATCT the weakening of the R1­C4 interface in favor of the interactions between the C-terminal helical region and the allosteric domain could produce a similar effect, pre-empting or even reversing the heterotropic effect of CTP. Thermostability ATCases are generally thermostable enzymes; E. coli ATCase loses only 25% activity after incubation for six hours at 60 8C, although the catalytic trimer is less thermostable and loses 80% of its activity.58 Since S. acidocaldarius is a hyperthermophilic archaeon thriving at temperatures around 80 8C, its ATCase is highly thermostable.17 Despite the high thermostability, we find that the C1 ­ C2 type is drastically weakened. This contrasts with the recently reported findings on the catalytic subunit trimer structure of P. abyssi ATCase, where this interface is stronger than in E. coli. Therefore, the stability of the holoenzyme has to be achieved through the association of the catalytic and the regulatory subunits whose main interaction area is situated at the C1 ­R1 type interfaces. A comparison of this type of interface in the EcATCT and SaATCT shows that the apolar fraction of the buried surface area is higher in SaATCT, in agreement with a stabilized interface.59 ­ 62 In EcATCT/R, the regulatory chains are considerably less thermostable than the catalytic subunits.58 In comparison with the catalytic chains, the regulatory chains are indeed more loosely organized in terms of tertiary structure. Whereas the catalytic chain domains are connected by two polypeptide chains and several non-covalent interactions, the regulatory chain domains are connected by one polypeptide chain and contain considerably less non-covalent interdomain interactions. Consequently, thermo-adaptation of ATCases with regulatory chains should have required more substantial modifications of the regulatory chains than of the catalytic chains.18 The SaATCT and EcATCT regulatory chains are indeed more divergent than their catalytic chains. The regulatory chain C terminus of SaATCT is extended in comparison to EcATCT. This region is stabilized in SaATCT due to the presence of extra secondary and tertiary structural features at the allosteric-zinc domain interface, including an increase in buried hydrophobic surface. Due to this rearrangement of the C terminus, the R1 ­ C4 interface is substantially weakened compared to EcATCT. This does not necessarily reduce the overall thermostability, because weakening of the R1 ­ C4 interface has been shown to be possible without decreasing the overall thermostability of E. coli ATCase.29 Overall, we can therefore hypothesize that the C1 ­R1, the allosteric-zinc and the novel C1 ­ R2 type interfaces are important for thermostability, whereas C1 ­C2 and R1 ­C4 interfaces can even be weaker. We further analyzed a number of other factors

° wavelength of 1.00 A. Data collection was performed at 100 K on a single crystal. A high-resolution dataset was ° collected to 2.5 A, followed by a low-resolution dataset ° to 2.8 A. Data processing was carried out using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK.69 The diffraction ° intensities were scaled and merged to 2.6 A resolution using the program SCALEPACK. Intensities were converted into amplitudes using the program TRUNCATE from the CCP4 suite.70 The full data collection statistics are presented in Table 1. Structure determination One catalytic subunit of the E. coli ATCase (PDB 8AT1) served as a starting model for solving the structure by molecular replacement. Rotation and translation searches have been performed using the program AMoRe71 and the best solution calculated had a correlation coefficient of 54.9 and an R-factor of 49.8% in the ° resolution range 20 ­ 3.5 A. Cycles of rigid body refinement were performed using the program Refmac of the CCP4 package.70 Visual inspection of the resulting maps revealed interpretable electron density for most secondary structure elements of the catalytic subunit. Alternating rounds of simulated annealing refinement according to the slow-cooling protocol of CNS72 and model building using TURBO-FRODO73 resulted in maps with a clear density in the regions corresponding to the ATCase regulatory chain. In the final stages of refinement, Refmac was used for ARP-water cycling to refine the solvent structure, in combination with TLS refinement.74 Although the density is good for both subunits, exceptions occur in solvent-exposed loops. Specifically the electron density in residues 28 ­ 31 and 225­ 226 of the catalytic subunit and in residues 11 ­ 14 and 38 ­ 44 of the regulatory subunit is weak. Residues 74 ­ 80 of the catalytic subunit and residues 1 ­ 10, 40 ­ 41 and 161­ 164 of the regulatory subunit were not modeled due to absence of electron density. Structure analysis PDB entries 6AT1 and 1D09 were chosen as T and R state models of the E. coli ATCase for molecular comparison with S. acidocaldarius ATCase. PDB entry 1ML4 was used for molecular comparison with the P. abyssi ATCase catalytic subunit. Structure validation was performed with the program PROCHECK;75 secondary structure was assigned using DSSP.76 Hydrogen bonds between protein atoms were calculated with the program HBPLUS77 with the default parameters for distance and angles. The presence of salt-bridges was inferred when Asp or Glu side-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms were ° found to be within a 4.0 A distance from the nitrogen atoms in Arg, Lys and His side-chains. We defined an interacting aromatic pair as one for which the distance ° between phenyl ring centroids was less than 7 A and with dihedral angles within 308 of 908.78 Accessible surface areas were calculated with the programs ACCESS and ACCFMT.79 Probe-accessible cavity volumes were ° searched with the program VOIDOO80 using a 1.2 A ° probe radius and a minimum volume of 10 A3, corresponding to "real" cavities as described.81 VOIDOO was also used for van der Waals volume determination of the proteins. The real volumes were calculated by the Voronoi procedure,82 using the programs ACCESS and VOLUME.79 The packing density was calculated as the ratio of the van der Waals volume to the real volume.

considered to be important in general thermostability of enzymes. Every enzyme seems to have a unique combination of strategies,63 ­ 68 and the same is true for the SaATCT enzyme. In particular, there is a decreased occurrence of "thermolabile" Gln residues, and a higher occurrence of charged residues,37,39 leading to an increase in ion pair networks.38,39 EcATCR, but not EcATCT, has more ion pairs than SaATCT, but the ion pairs of SaATCT are more frequently involved in the formation of networks, stressing the importance of ion pair networks compared to individual pairs.38,39 The catalytic subunit structure of P. abyssi ATCase demonstrates an even more prominent role for charge­ charge interactions.21 Further adaptions seem to be an increased number of tyrosine residues resulting in an increased number of aromatic pairs, and the absence of cavities in SaATCT. Because of the complexity of the interplay between its structure and function, adaptation to extreme temperatures might not have been compatible with the maintenance or rather the emergence of the mechanisms of action present in E. coli ATCase. Significant structural differences were found in regions important for its allosteric behavior, located often at interfaces between domains or subunits. Some of these regions require a certain degree of flexibility, a property that is counterproductive in adaptation of proteins to high temperatures. It is therefore possible that the adaptation of S. acidocaldarius ATCase resulted in the observed shift of the unliganded T state enzyme towards the R state and the differences in regulatory behavior. Elucidation of the crystal structures of the R state and effector-liganded ATCases of S. acidocaldarius, together with thermostability studies on mutant enzymes, may provide further answers.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization Protein purified following a method described earlier17 was used to grow crystals with the hangingdrop, vapour-diffusion technique at 293 K. Protein solution (1 ml) (10 mg/ml in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM EDTA) was mixed with 1 ml of reservoir solution (100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4), 30% saturated ammonium sulfate). Within three to four days large crystals (0.6 mm £ 0.3 mm) with the shape of a hexagonal prism appeared, which often had smoothed edges that gave the crystals an egg-like appearance. Crystals obtained at a higher pH diffracted to lower resolution. Data collection Selected crystals were transferred to a solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol in mother liquor prior to flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. The X-ray diffraction data were collected on a MAR CCD (MAR Research) detector system on the XRD synchrotron beamline at the ELETTRA synchrotron in Trieste using radiation with a
