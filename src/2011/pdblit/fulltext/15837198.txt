Structure of the DNA Binding Region of Prospero Reveals a Novel Homeo-Prospero Domain
Jodi M. Ryter,1 Chris Q. Doe,2 and Brian W. Matthews1,3 1 Institute of Molecular Biology Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Physics 2 Institute of Neuroscience and Institute of Molecular Biology Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Biology 1229 University of Oregon Eugene, Oregon 97403 nuclear localization of Prospero in neuroblasts show misexpression of GMC-specific genes [8]. Thus, the proper subcellular localization of Prospero (cytoplasmic in neuroblasts; nuclear in GMCs) is essential for normal CNS development. The protein domains of Prospero involved in its subcellular localization and transcriptional regulation functions have been defined. The C-terminal 160 amino acids consist of a highly divergent putative homeodomain (HD; residues 1241­1303) [9, 10] and an associated "Prospero domain" (PD; residues 1304­1403) that are essential for sequence-specific DNA binding and the transcriptional activation function of Prospero [11]. In addition, a nuclear export signal has been defined within the putative homeodomain, which in turn can be masked by the Prospero domain [12]. Finally, a Drosophila-specific central domain is necessary and sufficient for asymmetric cortical localization of Prospero in neuroblasts [4], due to its ability to bind the membrane-associated adaptor protein Miranda [7, 13­17]. Prospero orthologs (i.e., members of the Prospero/ Prox1 family) have been identified in many animals, such as D. virilis, C. elegans, X. laevis, zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human (Figure 1) [18­24]. The only common feature of this family of proteins is the C-terminal homeodomain/Prospero domain motif. This conserved C-terminal region is required for nearly all the known functions of Prospero, including regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic localization, sequence-specific DNA binding, and transcriptional activation. The strong conservation of the linked homeodomain/Prospero domain region, together with its constellation of interrelated functions (nuclear import/nuclear export/DNA binding), made it an attractive target for structural analysis. Atypical homeodomain structures have been solved previously [25, 26], and threading analysis predicts that the putative Prospero homeodomain is capable of assuming a typical homeodomain structure [27], but these analyses were done with isolated homeodomains. Moreover, the putative Prospero homeodomain is even more divergent than the structurally characterized atypical homeodomains, and it was not known whether it would assume such a structure either in isolation or in combination with the Prospero domain. ° Here we report the 2.05 A X-ray structure of the predicted Prospero homeodomain together with the Prospero domain. The structure reveals that the overall region forms a single structural unit that here we name a "homeo-prospero domain." It provides a structural explanation for the role of the Prospero domain region in masking the nuclear export signal that is present within the homeodomain region, and for the role of the Prospero domain region in modulating the DNA binding specificity of the putative homeodomain.

Summary The Prospero transcription factor promotes neural differentiation in Drosophila, and its activity is tightly regulated by modulating its subcellular localization. Prospero is exported from the nucleus of neural precursors but imported into the nucleus of daughter cells, which is necessary for their proper differentiation. Prospero has a highly divergent putative homeodomain adjacent to a conserved Prospero domain; both are required for sequence-specific DNA binding. Here we show that the structure of these two regions consists of a single structural unit (a homeo-prospero domain), in which the Prospero domain region is in position to contribute to DNA binding and also to mask a defined nuclear export signal that is within the putative homeodomain region. We propose that the homeo-prospero domain coordinately regulates Prospero nuclear localization and DNA binding specificity. Introduction The Drosophila central nervous system develops from a population of neural precursor cells (neuroblasts) that divide asymmetrically into two distinct daughter cells, one of which (the ganglion mother cell; GMC) divides again and terminally differentiates into a pair of neurons. An important regulator of neural differentiation is prospero, which encodes a 1403 amino acid transcription factor that is required in GMCs to activate neuronal differentiation genes [1], repress neuroblast-specific genes [2], and repress cell cycle genes [3]. Prospero is detected in neuroblasts, but at interphase it is cytoplasmic and thus incapable of regulating gene expression. During neuroblast mitosis, Prospero protein is asymmetrically localized to the cell membrane, resulting in all Prospero protein being deposited into the newborn GMC [4­6]. Following neuroblast cytokinesis, Prospero protein is released from the GMC membrane and is translocated into the GMC nucleus, where it can regulate gene expression. Mutants that abolish or block nuclear localization of Prospero in the GMC result in defective GMC differentiation [7], whereas mutants that result in

Results and Discussion Structure Determination and Refinement The C-terminal 163 amino acids of Drosophila Prospero (residues 1241­1403) were overexpressed, purified, and crystallized (Experimental Procedures; Figure 1). The ° X-ray structure was determined at 2.05 A resolution utilizing MAD phasing techniques with SeMet. The experimental phases yielded interpretable electron density from which an initial model was built (Figure 2). Iterative refinement and model building resulted in the final model. Crystallographic refinement converged with a final Rcryst/Rfree of 21.6%/25.6% (Experimental Procedures; Table 1). Overview of the Homeo-Prospero Domain Structure The overall structure of the homeo-prospero domain (HPD) is illustrated in Figures 3A and 3B. Despite classification as highly divergent based on sequence comparisons [9, 10], residues 1241­1303 were predicted to be capable of assuming a canonical homeodomain structure [27]. In fact, our structural analysis shows that this region does assume an overall fold very similar to homeodomains but with one striking difference. In every homeo-

domain structure determined to date, the so-called DNA recognition helix is either at the extreme C terminus of the protein or leads into a flexible linker of variable length that connects to another essentially independent domain. In Prospero, the recognition helix ( 3) connects the putative homeodomain and the Prospero domain as a single structural unit. The region corresponding to the Prospero domain can be described as a four-helix bundle ( 3­ 6; Figure 3A). Residues 1314­1326 are disordered and residues 1368­1370 and 1391­1394 form short 310 helices. While interactions between the homeoand Prospero domain regions occur primarily within the hydrophobic core, the C-terminal residues of the Prospero domain region make additional contacts with the homeodomain region by extending into a cleft between helices 1 and 2. Structure of the Homeodomain Region A structural comparison of the homeodomain region (HD) alone using Dali [28] revealed that, while possessing a highly divergent class sequence, the structure assumes a fold most similar to the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain (Q50K mutant, PDB ID code 2HDD, 51 ° C atoms with rmsd 2.5 A) [29]. Based on the results of the threading analysis mentioned above, and this Dali

tent with a standard homeodomain hydrophobic core. Variations occur primarily at the loop between 1 and 2 and in the middle of 3. In these regions, residues that would be on the surface of a typical homeodomain are replaced by bulky hydrophobic groups that interact with the hydrophobic core of the Prospero domain. Within the loop, Phe1261 and Trp1262, along with the invariant Phe1260, create a very hydrophobic turn that protrudes into this core region. In the middle of 3, Phe1298, Tyr1299, Tyr1300, and Met1303 contribute to the hydrophobic core of the Prospero domain four-helix bundle. Structure of the Prospero Domain Region The Prospero domain region (PD) is composed of a fourhelix bundle ( 3­ 6). Consecutive helices are antiparallel and all helices interact via ridges in grooves (Figures 3A and 3B). The up-down-up-down topology is the simplest found among four-helix bundles and in this case is right turning [31]. The central residues of this bundle, representing the -carbons in closest proximity, are Ala1307 of 3 and Phe1361 of 5. The 50 crossing angle between the helix axes is also the most common angle found in globular proteins. The core consists of hydrophobic residues throughout that are either invariant or highly conserved throughout the Prospero/Prox1 protein family (Figure 1). As noted above, a number of residues within the homeodomain region also contribute to this hydrophobic core. The Interface between the Homeodomain and Prospero Domain Regions The homeodomain and the Prospero domain regions do not just touch each other; rather, they interact quite

comparison, a detailed residue-by-residue analysis was possible. A majority of the core residues seen in the homeodomain region are either invariant or conserved hydrophobic with respect to the Engrailed homeodomain sequence or homeodomain consensus sequence [30], indicating that this region possesses a core consis-

Identical color coding is used in all illustrations. This and other similar illustrations were generated using RIBBONS [46]. (B) Stereo view of the -carbon backbone of Prospero, residues 1245­1396.

extensively. If the two regions are considered as sepa° rate entities, then 22% (1499 A2 ) of the surface area of the homeodomain region contributes to the interface with the Prospero domain region and, vice versa, 35% of the surface of the Prospero domain region contributes to the same interface. These fractions are significantly higher than the average value of 15% that is observed for the surface area involved in the interfaces of typical protein dimers [32]. It confirms that the homeodomain and Prospero domain regions combine to form a distinct structural unit. There are extensive hydrophobic core contacts that occur between the HD and PD regions. A hydrophobic cleft on the HD is formed between Trp1262 and Tyr1274 of the strand just C-terminal to 1 and 2, respectively. SeMet1259 forms the floor of this cleft, with Val1263 and Val1270 flanking one end. Seated in the cleft are Val1389, Pro1390, and Phe1393 of the PD region. This cleft is flanked at the opposite end by a hydrogen-bonding interaction between His1252 and Asp1277. Phe1275, of the strand C-terminal to 2, positions Lys1255 of 1 in an orientation optimal for a number of hydrogen-

bonding interactions. These include direct interactions with backbone carbonyls of residues 1274 and 1393, thereby creating contacts between HD 1 and 2, as well as the PD region. Dali analysis reveals that there are interesting similarities between the HPD structure and that of the MATa1/ MAT 2 homeodomain heterodimer bound to DNA [33]. In the HPD structure, the C terminus of the PD region (residues 1388­1396) extends into a cleft between 1 (residues 1250­1259) and 2 (residues 1268­1274) of the HD region (Figure 4, top). This rather lengthy segment includes a 310 helix (residues 1391­1394) and contacts the HD region on the face opposite its DNA binding surface. This interaction between HD and PD is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, as well as a number of hydrogen bonds. In the homeodomain heterodimer complex between MATa1 and MAT 2 (Figure 4, bottom), the C terminus of MAT 2 also extends away from the body of the domain and similarly makes hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions within a groove formed between 1 and 2 of MATa1. This binding groove on the homeodomain MATa1 corresponds to that within

Comparison of the Prospero HPD and S. cerevisiae MATa1/MAT 2 Homeodomain Heterodimer Note the similar fashion in which the C-terminal tails of PD/MAT 2 pack into a hydrophobic cleft formed between 1 and 2 of HD/ MATa1 (see text). MATa1 and MAT 2 are illustrated in red and yellow, respectively. The HPD is illustrated as described in Figure 3.

the HD region of Prospero. In addition, the polypeptide chain that binds within the respective grooves in both cases adopts an -helical or 310-helical conformation (Figure 4). The MATa1/MAT 2 homeodomain complex is required for cell type-specific transcriptional repression in yeast [34]. The Prospero HPD is also required for regulating transcription [11], but may have an additional function in controlling the subcellular localization of Prospero. Demidenko et al. [12] utilized molecular dissection of the HPD with expression of chimeric proteins in mammalian and insect cultured cells to show that residues 1248­1261, encompassing 1, contain a nuclear export signal (NES). In the absence of any portion of the PD region, Prospero is exported from the nucleus via the Exportin pathway and subsequently found in the cytoplasm, while presence of this region blocks nuclear export and allows Prospero to accumulate in the nucleus. The HPD structure shown in Figure 4 strongly suggests that it is the extreme C terminus of the PD region that sterically prevents access to the nuclear export signal. Interestingly, previous analysis of Prospero during asymmetric cell division showed its phosphorylation state to correlate with subcellular localization [35]. Cytoplasmic Prospero is highly phosphorylated compared to nuclear Prospero, which raises the possibility that phosphorylated HPD may have a more open conformation in which the NES is exposed. Protein-DNA Binding Model In the Dali structural comparison mentioned above, the structure of the HD region is most similar to the Engrailed homeodomain (see above) [29]. It is therefore possible

to use the structural superposition matrix determined by Dali to model the HPD structure in complex with DNA. The result is shown in Figure 5A. Three regions of potential protein-DNA contact are suggested. First, the DNA recognition helix 3 appears to contact the major groove of the DNA; second, the N-terminal arm appears to contact the minor groove of the DNA; and third, unexpectedly, the PD region appears to contact the DNA backbone via residues within or close to the N terminus of helix 6. The Dali structural alignment of the Prospero HD region with the Engrailed homeodomain concurs completely with the threading analysis [27]. Figure 5B illustrates these alignments at the sequence level. While the convention is to describe homeodomain structures using the homeodomain consensus sequence numbering scheme [30], here we maintain the native numbering of the HD region due to its intimate association with the Prospero domain. Figure 6A illustrates the key residues of the Engrailed recognition helix known to make contacts in the DNA major groove. Engrailed homeodomain residues Asn51 (Pros HD Asn1294) and Arg53 (Pros HD Arg1296) are invariant and presumably contact the DNA in a similar fashion. In the Engrailed structure, Ile47 (Pros HD Lys1290) and Lys50 (Pros HD Ser1293) also contact the bases in the major groove to provide binding site discrimination. Pros HD Glu1297 appears poised in the major groove available for possible water-mediated contacts. Additionally, there are a number of residues that are not only invariant between the Engrailed homeodomain and the Prospero HD region, but are also positioned to make similar contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone as seen in the Engrailed homeodomain structure. In particular, Engrailed homeodomain Arg53 (Pros HD Arg1296) and Tyr25 (Pros HD Tyr1265) are predicted to interact directly with one strand of the DNA backbone in a similar fashion, while Trp48 (HD Trp1291) could interact with the opposite strand. In the Engrailed homeodomain structure, the N-terminal arm (residues 5­9) fits into the DNA minor groove, supplementing the contacts made by the recognition helix. In the Prospero HPD-DNA model, the N-terminal arm has a somewhat different alignment (Figure 6A) but could easily move so as to contact the DNA. A sequence comparison reveals predominantly conservative differences between the Engrailed and the Prospero sequences in the N-terminal arm, except at Engrailed homeodomain Arg5 (Pros HD Ser1245; Figure 5B), a position shown to be important for binding site discrimination [36]. This structural comparison also suggests that the Prospero HD region may contact DNA as well (Figure 6B). Lys1380, -1376, and -1375, found within or close to the N terminus of the 6 helix, are all poised to potentially interact with the DNA phosphate backbone. The basic nature of this region is further manifest in the negative electrostatic potential of the molecular surface (Figure 6C). Tyr1379 and Ser1373 could possibly interact with the DNA backbone either directly or via hydrogen bond interactions. All these residues are conserved to a high degree in the Prospero/Prox class homeobox proteins (Figure 1). Of course, final confirmation of the HPD-DNA interactions discussed above must await the structure determination of the HPD structure in complex with its DNA binding site [11].

Biological Implications The Prospero transcription factor promotes neural differentiation in Drosophila, and its activity is tightly regulated by modulating its subcellular localization. Prospero is exported from the nucleus of neural precursors, but imported into the nucleus of daughter cells, which is necessary for their proper differentiation. Based on sequence similarity, the structure of Prospero was thought to contain, toward its carboxyl terminus, a homeodomain plus a Prospero domain, both of which are required for sequence-specific DNA binding. Here we determine the structure of this region of the protein and show that it does include the expected homeodomain. Instead of forming an essentially independent unit, however, the Prospero domain is shown to join together with the homeodomain to form a larger structural unit that we name a "homeo-prospero domain." Model building suggests that this larger structural unit serves in part to align the Prospero domain region on the DNA target. Also, the Prospero domain region is positioned in such

a way that it is able to mask a defined nuclear export signal that is within the homeodomain region.
Experimental Procedures Protein Overexpression and Purification Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Gold cells (Stratagene) were transformed with an expression vector encoding Drosophila melanogaster Prospero (C-terminal residues 1241­1403) fused to a noncleavable C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The expression vector was constructed by amplifying the Prospero gene with PCR mixtures containing Deep Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a TECHNE thermocycler. The flanking restriction sites, NcoI and XhoI, were added with the following primers: 5 end primer, 5 -CAT GCC ATG GGC ACT CCT TTG CAC TCT TCT ACA TTG ACA CCG AT-3 ; 3 end primer, 5 -CCG CTC GAG TTC CAG CTG CTC TAA AAA ATT GGG CGA CTT GA-3 . The PCR product was ligated into the Novagen pET-28b expression vector utilizing a Zero Blunt PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) as an intermediary step to improve cloning efficiency, and the sequence was verified. Expression of the protein from pET-28b resulted in the addition of the C-terminal noncleavable hexahistidine tag LEHHHHHH. Overexpression was performed using 4 L fermentation cultures. Cells were grown in LB-kanamycin broth (50 mg/L) at 37 C, 750

rpm, and 10­15 L of air per minute to OD600 0.9. The temperature was then reduced to 25 C and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl -Dthiogalactoside (IPTG) to 0.5 mM and continuing growth for 3 hr at 25 C and 250 rpm. The SeMet derivative was expressed with the same strains as described [37]. The cells were suspended in 50 ml of T/G buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole with 40 g/ml DNase, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 Complete/EDTAfree [Boehringer-Mannheim] inhibitor tablet), and lysed by passage through a French press. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 35,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto an NiNTA agarose column (Qiagen, 10 ml) equilibrated with T/G buffer (no DNase, MgCl2, or inhibitor tablet) at 4 C. The column was washed with equilibration buffer followed by T/G buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). The protein was eluted with 100 mM imidazole in T/G buffer. The fractions corresponding to Prospero (residues 1241­1403), as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled, 5 mM EDTA was added, and dialyzed against 4 L of 15 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mM NaCl overnight at 4 C. This was followed by an additional 4 hr dialysis in fresh buffer to ensure equilibration. The dialysate was cleared of minor precipitation by centrifugation at 35,000 g for 30 min. Prospero (residues 1241­1403) was found to be 99.9% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10% and allowed to incubate on ice for 1 hr. Subsequently, the protein was concentrated using an Amicon Centriprep (10 KDa MWCO), spin filtered (#8160 Costar, Corning) to remove minor precipitation, and concentrated to the 8 mg/ml range using an Amicon Centricon (10 KDa MWCO; 6 mg/ ml for SeMet derivative). Protein concentrations were determined

by absorption at 280 nm using the theoretical extinction coefficient of Prospero (residues 1241­1403), 28,590 M 1 cm 1, calculated using EXPASY ProtParam (http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). Typical yields were 13 mg/4 L culture. The SeMet derivative was purified in an identical manner with typical yields of 6 mg/4 L for SeMet derivatives and were concentrated to 6 mg/ml. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was utilized to confirm SeMet incorporation. Crystallization and Data Collection Crystals of the SeMet derivative were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Equal volumes of protein (5.8 mg/ml, 15 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) and well solution (21% PEG 4000, 100 mM Tris [pH 8.5]) were mixed in the presence of 0.01 mM n-tetradecyl -D-maltoside at room temperature. Crystals appeared overnight with rod-like morphology, growing to a typical length of 0.18 mm within a week (space group P21; unit cell dimensions a ° ° ° 35.3 A, b 49.9 A, c 51.5 A, 97.4 ; one molecule/asymmetric unit). Cryogenic crystal preservation was achieved by the presence ° of 10% glycerol. The 2.05 A multiwavelength data set (Table 1) was collected at 100 K at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley Lab) on beamline 5.0.2. Data were merged and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK [38]. Structure Determination The structure of Prospero (residues 1241­1403) was solved by MAD phasing using SeMet [39]. Four of five potential selenium sites were identified using SOLVE [40]. Two additional half-sites were located and MAD phases were refined using SHARP [41]. These initial phases were further improved by solvent flattening with SOLOMON

[42]. The experimental electron density for residues 1245­1396 was readily traceable despite absent density for the disordered loop residues 1314­1326. The model was built using O [43]. A final model (1351 atoms plus 83 oxygens from H2O) was obtained after iterative rounds of refinement using CNS [44] and manual rebuilding.
