We have designed, synthesized, and tested in vitro a novel class of noncovalent thrombin inhibitors. The main feature of these inhibitors is a 6,5-fused bicyclic core structure that fills the S2 pocket of the active site of thrombin. The bicycle introduces conformational constraint into the ligand and locks the Xaa-Pro amide bond into the desired trans configuration. Among the known ring systems, we selected by molecular modeling the 7-thiaindolizidinones (BTD) as our basic template. The influence of several structural features was analyzed: the length of the argininal side chain, the stereochemistry at C6, and the importance of making optimal use of the S3 pocket. Finally, an X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor 15 bound to thrombin was obtained at a resolution of 2.3 Å. These designed thrombin inhibitors, which were prepared by an efficient synthesis, showed high selectivity over trypsin and other serine proteases. Further derivation based on the information obtained by X-ray crystallography should certainly allow to improve the potency.
Introduction Thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the industrial world. The currently available drugs, heparins and coumarins, are unsatisfactory in many ways. For instance, both classes of compounds require careful monitoring of the patient to avoid serious bleeding. Therefore, new orally bioavailable antithrombotics are needed to replace those that are used nowadays.1 One approach actively pursued is the development of a direct thrombin inhibitor. Thrombin is a trypsin-like serine protease with many functions.2 Predominantly, it is the key terminal protease in the coagulation cascade and plays a central role in both hemostasis and thrombosis. Thrombin effectively catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage of the soluble plasma protein fibrinogen to form insoluble fibrin leading to clot formation. Considerable efforts have been devoted to the discovery of novel classes of inhibitors, which are safe, selective, and orally bioavailable and show a long duration of action.3 Most inhibitors form a covalent bond with Ser 195 located in the active site of thrombin and are based on the initial observation that the chloromethyl ketone of D-Phe-Pro-Arg (PPACK) could mimic the sequence of fibrinogen. These inhibitors bear an electrophilic functionality like a boronic acid, an aldehyde, a ketoamide, or a fluoromethyl ketone. However, all these inhibitors possess a reactive functional group and therefore present several common problems, like lack of selectivity over other trypsin-like enzymes, rapid clearance, and low oral bioavailability. In this paper, we disclose a novel series of compounds, which belong to the noncovalent class of inhibitors. Their main feature is a 6,5-fused bicyclic ring system, which occupies the S2 binding pocket in the active site of thrombin. Design Noncovalent thrombin inhibitors are molecules that do not interact covalently with Ser 195 but rather form strong hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with the enzyme. A prominent example of this class of compounds is hirudin, a 65-aa peptide extracted from the leech Hirudo medicinalis.4 Hirudin interacts with the enzyme in two ways. The N-terminus of hirudin binds to the enzyme active site with the polypeptide chain running in a direction opposite to that expected for a substrate, whereas the highly acidic C-terminal part binds to the negatively charged exosite of thrombin. The affinity of hirudin for thrombin is very high: Ki ) 10-14 M. Among the low-molecular-weight compounds, early prototypes of the noncovalent class of inhibitors, argatroban5 and NAPAP,6 were the result of careful structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies (Figure 1). Argatroban is a highly thrombin-selective inhibitor in development. This initial success as well as structural information from X-ray crystals of both NAPAP and argatroban7 bound to human R-thrombin prompted the search for other nonelectrophilic thrombin inhibitors. The replacement of the basic guanidino moiety of argatroban has been an active field of research.8 Along a similar line, CRC 2209 and napsagatran10 are two additional compounds showing very potent in vitro activity. The latter is extremely selective over trypsin but suffers from a lengthy synthesis. More recently, other inhibitors, possessing completely novel structures, were disclosed in the literature.11 Among them, two ligands are particularly noteworthy: inogatran,12 which is a very potent inhibitor based on a tripeptide motif, and the conformationally very rigid tricyclic inhibitor published by Obst et al.13 Except for the last example, all noncovalent thrombin inhibitors developed so far are highly flexible molecules. They can adopt multiple conformations due to numerous freely rotatable single bonds. On the other hand, it is a well-established principle that the affinity of a ligand will increase if its conformational flexibility in solution is limited to the bound conformation. Clearly, this

statement proves true only if all hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the protein are maintained in the right position.14 In the case of thrombin, the S2 binding site is often occupied by proline or another monocyclic amino acid. We reasoned that the flexibility could be further reduced by replacing the monocyclic amino acid by a fused bicyclic system (Figure 2). The 6,5-bicyclic ring system, which should fill the S2 binding site of the enzyme, can be viewed as the result of a covalent link between the C5 position of proline and the adjacent amino acid. A definite advantage of such a template is that the XaaPro amide bond is locked into the trans configuration, permitting the formation of two important hydrogen bonds with Gly 216 of thrombin as found in most potent inhibitors. In freely rotatable molecules, the cis isomer, which cannot bind to thrombin, might be present in considerable amounts (2-11%) under physiological conditions, because the difference in free energy between the cis and trans isomers of Xaa-Pro is small (0.5 kcal/mol).15 In addition to having carbonyl and amine functionalities at C5 and C6, respectively, the ideal bicycle should fulfill several important criteria. Two attachment points are necessary: one at C3 possessing the S configuration which will provide the attachment for the guanidino fragment and the second at C6 for the attachment of a hydrophobic residue filling out the S3 binding site. The "upper" surface of the bicycle, located below the flap formed by Trp 60D, should be hydrophobic. Finally, a short and stereoselective synthesis of the

bicycle is desirable in order to have a practical approach to this novel class of ligands. A search of the literature provided a number of fused bicyclic systems that were of interest. The 7-thiaindolizidinone amino acid 1 (Figure 2), which has been introduced by Nagai et al.,16 was selected. It has first been used as a mimetic for a -turn dipeptide and is therefore often abbreviated BTD. The thiaza[4.3.0]alkane amino acid 1 is stable under physiological conditions and has been introduced into various peptides17 and biologically active molecules.18 The X-ray crystal structure of a derivative of BTD is available19 and was used as a starting point for our molecular modeling studies (see the Experimental Section). The calculations indicated that BTD had the adequate structural characteristics to serve as a building block for thrombin inhibitors. Unfortunately the molecular modeling studies could not establish unambiguously the optimal configuration for binding at C6. Therefore, we decided to synthesize and evaluate both bicycles in parallel. Chemistry The originally published 7-thiaindolizidinone (S-BTD) 1 possesses the S configuration at C6 and can be prepared by various synthetic routes.20 In our case, we also needed the R-BTD building block with the R configuration at C6. The synthesis is outlined in Scheme 1 and was adapted from the original procedure for S-BTD.16 Starting from D-glutamic acid 5-methyl ester,

The isomers 4a,b could be separated by preparative HPLC. ROESY 1H NMR spectra provided clear evidence that the major diastereoisomer 4a had the S and the minor 4b the R configuration at C9, respectively.21 The phthalimido protecting group was removed by using hydrazine hydrate to afford the amine 5. The free amino functionality was then coupled to various sulfonyl chlorides or protected with the tertbutoxycarbonyl group (6-8) before the ethyl ester was hydrolyzed (Scheme 2). The free acid was coupled to Boc-protected alkylguanidines having two different chain lengths. Finally, all protecting groups were removed in one step to afford the inhibitors 13-16 as their trifluoroacetic acid salts. In an analogous manner, the ligands 25-28 were obtained from Fmoc-protected S-BTD (Scheme 3). All the inhibitors were found to be very hygroscopic foams on which it was difficult to obtain suitable elemental analyses. Therefore, they were analyzed by reversephase HPLC (see the Experimental Section).

R-thrombin was determined. The resolution was 2.3 Å and the final R-factor 18.7% (for crystallographic details, see the Experimental Section). The X-ray crystal structure of thrombin-bound 15 confirmed partly the originally proposed binding mode (Figure 3, left). Compound 15 is bound to the active site of the enzyme with the argininal side chain extending into the S1 pocket and making close electrostatic contacts with Asp 189 and Gly 219 (Figure 4). The benzyl group lies in the hydrophobic S3 pocket interacting orthogonally with Trp 215. The 6,5-fused bicycle, R-BTD, fits nicely into the hydrophobic S2 pocket. The bulky hydrophobic sulfur atom lies well-buried under the Trp 60D flap, and as expected, the two hydrogen bonds with Gly 216 are conserved. Thus all important interactions commonly found in low-molecular-weight thrombin inhibitors are present at the active site. Figure 3, right shows a superimposition of thrombin-bound 15 based on the

results obtained from the X-ray crystal structure and the molecular modeling calculations. A major difference is the position occupied by R-BTD. The shift of the bicycle does not affect the argininal side chain and the benzyl group, which are similarly located in the S1 and S3 pockets, respectively. Remarkably, the carbonyl and the amino group interacting with Gly 216 are also located in very close proximity in each binding mode, emphasizing the importance of these two hydrogen bonds. A direct overlay of the two "proline" rings of the 7-thiaindolizidinone (data not shown) shows that the conformation of the six-membered ring is different from the X-ray structure of S-BTD found in the Cambridge Structural Database.19 This conformational modification explains the two different positions occupied by the bicycle in Figure 3, right. The new conformation clearly has a positive effect on binding by allowing a better fit of the 7-thiaindolizidinone bicycle into the S2 pocket without affecting the other important ligand-enzyme interactions. As with other force fields, the torsional angle of the sulfonamide is not treated correctly within CHARMM (see the Experimental Part). The situation could be improved by changing the standard atom type for the nitrogen from NT (tetrahedral nitrogen) to NP (nitrogen in an amide bond). Even so this modification is not optimal; the results were found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements. Biological Results and Discussion The in vitro data for the thrombin inhibitors are summarized in Table 1. Chromogenic assays were carried out with important serine proteases including thrombin, trypsin, factor Xa, and plasmin. Selectivity ratios of trypsin/thrombin are tabulated. All inhibitors were found to be inactive against plasmin.

Mean ( SD of triplicate measurements.

Four compounds (13, 14, 25, 26) lack a hydrophobic group to fill the S3 pocket. Therefore it is not surprising that their inhibitory activity is low, but they provide useful information concerning selectivity. Substrates 13 and 25, which have a longer argininal side chain (n ) 2), show some selectivity for trypsin, whereas 14 and 26 are thrombin-selective. Previously, molecular modeling calculations had predicted that the optimal side chain length would be n ) 1 rather than n ) 2. These arguments prompted us to focus on the guanylated propyl side chain only. In the next step, we prepared the sulfonamides bearing bulky hydrophobic groups. The naphthyl derivatives 16 and 28 were clearly too bulky to fit the S3 pocket. On the other hand, it has been very gratifying to find out that the benzylsulfonamides 15 and 27 have an almost 2 orders of magnitude higher potency than 14 and 26. This considerable gain in binding indicates the necessity of making optimal use of the hydrophobic interactions in the S3 pocket. The comparison of the S-BTD with the R-BTD series, which have the opposite stereochemistry at C6, gave interesting results. Among all the inhibitors tested, the stereochemistry at C6 had virtually no effect on the binding affinity: the S-BTD series being more potent by a factor of 3 at the most. The most potent inhibitor 27 had also a very good 70-fold selectivity over trypsin. In conclusion, careful design using molecular modeling allowed us to develop very rapidly a novel class of direct noncovalent thrombin inhibitors with affinities in the nanomolar range. Their main characteristic is a fused 6,5-bicycle, which reduces the flexibility of the ligand. X-ray crystallography showed that inhibitor 15 satisfies all important ligand-protein interactions. On the other hand, it was found that the conformation of the 7-thiaindolizidinone bicycle (R-BTD) bound to thrombin was different form the published structure of S-BTD alone. The influence of the stereochemistry at C6 on the potency of the inhibitors was found to be surprisingly low. Ligands with higher affinity should be obtained by further optimizing the fit of the ligand in the S3 pocket. Experimental Section

Molecular modeling started from the X-ray structure of the NAPAP/thrombin complex, structure 1DWD from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. The position of the Gly 216 carbonyl is unusual in this X-ray structure: the distance from the carbonyl oxygen to the NAPAP sulfonamide nitrogen is very short (2.27 Å), and the  angle is 156°. This angle is closer to 180° in other thrombin X-ray structures. The initial value of this angle was changed to -170° for this paper, and a harmonic constraint with a force constant of 10.0 was added to the carbonyl group of Gly 216. Test calculations showed that the carbonyl had a tendency to flip into a conformation with a  angle around 100° otherwise. The X-ray structure of S-BTD was used for the bicyclic system.19 The five-membered ring of the bicycle was manually docked into the S2 binding site with the help of the in-house molecular graphics program WITNOTP. Further visual inspection showed that the optimal side chain attached at C3 should have a length of three methylene units. This length would locate the guanidino group in an ideal position to form hydrogen bonds with Asp 189 in the S1 pocket. The phenethyl and benzylsulfonyl moieties were attached at C6 in the R and S configurations in order to evaluate the optimal space filling of the S3 pocket. The starting structures were then minimized using CHARMM 23.25 The atom types and charges were assigned within QUANTA 4.0.25 The "charge templates" method was used with "charge smoothing" on carbons and nonpolar hydrogens to calculate the charges. All residues within 5 Å of the inhibitor were included into the minimization process, whereas the rest of the protein was kept fixed. Like other force fields, CHARMM does not calculate the dihedral angle of sulfonamides correctly. Due to a torsion potential with a periodicity of 3, conformations are generated in which the CN vector bisects the OSO angle in disagreement with experimental results. Test calculations with sulfonamides show that changing the atom type NT (tetrahedral nitrogen) automatically assigned by QUANTA into NP (nitrogen in an amide bond) improves the situation. However, optimal results for this torsion are obtained only if one reparametrizes this

The R configuration looked somewhat better than the S; however, a clear preference could not be shown. As an example for the final minimized structures, the model of 15 complexed to thrombin is shown in Figure 3, right. Crystallography. Thrombin was prepared for crystallization according to a published procedure.26 Crystals in the presence of benzamidine were grown at room temperature by seeding using the hanging-drop technique, similar to published procedures.27 Typical reservoir conditions were 28% PEG8000, 50 mM NaPi, pH 7.3. Crystals grown in the presence of benzamidine were harvested into 0.1 mL of this buffer and soaked overnight in a 10 mM concentration of 15 (with two exchanges into fresh buffer). The binding of 15 to thrombin in the soaked crystal is complete as seen from the electron density and the crystals showing no cracking. The X-ray intensity data were collected on a FAST television area detector with an Enraf-Nonius FR571 rotating anode operating at 40 kV and 80 mA. Data were measured at room temperature in 160-s frames of width 0.2° in , a detector-swing-out angle of 20°, and a crystal-to-detector distance of 55 mm. The evaluation of the measured intensities was performed by the program MADNES.28 Structure solution, refinement, and analysis were performed with the programs O29 and X-PLOR.30 Refinement was done using the target parameters of Engh and Huber.31 Water molecules were added if found as a peak in the Fo - Fc map (contoured at 3) making reasonable hydrogen bonds. Consult Table 2 for crystallographic details. The coordinates have been deposited at the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under the PDB ID code 1bhx. Chromogenic Assay. Human R-thrombin was purified inhouse according to Stone et al.32 Bovine pancreatic trypsin was purchased from Sigma. Human factor Xa was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim and human plasmin from KABI Vitrum. All Pefachrome substrates were purchased from Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland. Inhibitors were dissolved in cremophor/ethanol (1:1) and diluted in distilled water to yield a 1 mM solution. Further dilutions were made into assay buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Kinetic assays were performed at 25 °C using a 96-microwell plate; each well contained 50 mL of substrate, 100 mL of inhibitor, and 100 mL of enzyme in assay

Selective Noncovalent Thrombin Inhibitors buffer. Final concentrations of enzyme and substrate were as follows: 160 pM R-thrombin and 100 mM Pefachrome TH (Km ) 7.5 mM), 260 pM trypsin and 500 mM Pefachrome TRY (Km ) 146 mM), and 30 pM FXa and 250 mM Pefachrome Xa (Km ) 127 mM). Assays were initiated by adding enzyme to solutions containing inhibitor and substrate. The release of p-nitroaniline by hydrolysis of the substrate was followed for 30 min by measuring the increase in optical density at 405 nm with a Thermomax microwell kinetic reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The inhibition constant Ki was determined by fitting the data by weighted linear regression to the Dixon equation.33 The dissociation constants were determined in triplicate and expressed as mean ( SD.

The data of the X-ray structure of S-BTD are found in the Cambridge Structural Databank (Code SEYZUR). For the original procedure, see ref 16. A second approach was published by Bartlett et al., see ref 17d. Very recently, the Fmocprotected S-BTD became commercially available from Neosystem. The ROESY spectrum of the major diastereoisomer 4a showed a NOE effect between H-C2b and H-C9. On the other hand, the ROESY spectrum of 4b indicated NOE effects between H-C2a and H-C9 as well as between H-C9 and H-C7a. Prepared according to Bergeron, R. J.; McMarris, J. S. Total Synthesis of (()15-Deoxyspergualin. J. Org. Chem. 1987, 52, 1700-1703. Compound 18 is unstable and cyclizes to 18a even at low temperatures:

(24) The protons H-C2, H-C3, H-C6, H-C7, H-C8, and H-C9 have been assigned using 2D-COSY and 2D-ROESY spectra in benzene. The relative stereochemistry between H-C9 and H-C3 of the major diastereoisomer has been determined to be trans by NOE measurements in DMSO. The stereochemistry has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography of the ligand 15 bound to thrombin.
