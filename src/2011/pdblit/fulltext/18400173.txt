The tertiary structure of guanylyltransferase is similar to that of ATP-dependent DNA ligase, as is the architecture of the nucleotide-binding site (Subramanya ° et al., 1996; Hakansson et al., 1997). Capping enzymes and DNA ligases comprise a superfamily of covalent nucleotidyl transferases that appear to have diverged from a common ancestral enzyme (Shuman and Schwer, 1995). RNA triphosphatases are not conserved among eukarya and fall into at least two mechanistically and structurally distinct families: (1) the divalent cation-dependent RNA triphosphatases of DNA viruses and fungi (Yu et al., 1997; Gross and Shuman, 1998; Ho et al., 1998a; Jin et al., 1998; Yamada-Okabe et al., 1998) and (2) the divalent cation-independent RNA triphosphatases of nematodes, mammals, and other metazoa (Takagi et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997; Yue et al., 1997). The metazoan triphosphatases display extensive amino acid sequence similarity to protein tyrosine phosphatases, and, by analogy to the protein tyrosine phosphatases, it is proposed that they execute a two-step phosphoryl transfer reaction involving a covalent enzyme-(cysteinylS)-phosphate intermediate (Takagi et al., 1997; Ho et al., 1998b; Wen et al., 1998). Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cet1p exemplifies the class of divalent cation-dependent RNA triphosphatase enzymes. Other family members include the RNA triphosphatases encoded by pathogenic fungi (e.g., Candida albicans) and viruses (e.g., vaccinia, smallpox, and molluscum contagiosum). This triphosphatase family is defined by three conserved collinear motifs (A, B, and C) that include clusters of acidic and basic amino acids that are essential for catalytic activity (Ho et al., 1998c; Pei et al., 1999). The 549­amino acid Cet1p protein contains three domains: a 230­amino acid N-terminal segment that makes no discernible contribution to catalysis and is dispensable for Cet1p function in vivo; a protease-sensitive segment from residues 230 to 275 that is essential for Cet1p function in vivo and that mediates both Cet1p self-association and Cet1p binding to the yeast guanylyltransferase Ceg1p; and a catalytic domain from residues 275 to 539 that includes motifs A, B, and C (see Figure 1) (Lehman et al., 1999). The amino acid sequence and domain organization of the C. albicans RNA triphosphatase CaCet1p is similar to that of the S. cerevisiae protein (Yamada-Okabe et al., 1998; Lehman et al., 1999; Schwer et al., unpublished data). RNA triphosphatase is an attractive target for antifungal drug development because the triphosphatase activity is essential for yeast cell growth; the enzyme is conserved among fungi; the structure and mechanism of the fungal RNA triphosphatases are different from the human enzyme; and metazoan species encode no obvious homologs of the fungal enzyme. Thus, an inhibitor of fungal RNA triphosphatase should, in principle, have selectivity for the pathogen and minimal effect on the human host. To facilitate mechanistic and pharmacological studies of the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases, we have

Summary RNA triphosphatase is an essential mRNA processing enzyme that catalyzes the first step in cap formation. ° The 2.05 A crystal structure of yeast RNA triphosphatase Cet1p reveals a novel active site fold whereby an eight-stranded barrel forms a topologically closed triphosphate tunnel. Interactions of a sulfate in the center of the tunnel with a divalent cation and basic amino acids projecting into the tunnel suggest a catalytic mechanism that is supported by mutational data. Discrete surface domains mediate Cet1p homodimerization and Cet1p binding to the guanylyltransferase component of the capping apparatus. The structure and mechanism of fungal RNA triphosphatases are completely different from those of mammalian mRNA capping enzymes. Hence, RNA triphosphatase presents an ideal target for structure-based antifungal drug discovery. Introduction mRNA processing plays a critical role in the expression of eukaryotic genes. Processing occurs cotranscriptionally on nascent chains synthesized by RNA polymerase II. The earliest modification event is the formation of the m7GpppN cap. Capping entails three enzymatic reactions in which the 5 triphosphate end of pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a 5 diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase, then capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase, and methylated by RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (Shuman, 1995). Each of the cap-forming activities is essential for cell growth in budding yeast (Shibagaki et al., 1992; Schwer and Shuman, 1994; Mao et al., 1996; Tsukamoto et al., 1997; Wang and Shuman, 1997; Ho et al., 1998a). RNA guanylyltransferases are structurally and mechanistically conserved among fungi, mammals, and DNA viruses. The signature features of the guanylyltransferases are a ping-pong reaction mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer through a covalent enzyme-(lysyl-N)-GMP intermediate (Shuman and Hurwitz, 1981) and a set of six conserved peptide motifs involved in GTP binding and catalysis (Shuman and Schwer, 1995; Wang et al., 1997). The crystal structure of Chlorella virus guanylyltransferase in the GTP- and GMP-bound states highlights the

Figure 1. Structural Conservation among Fungal RNA Triphosphatases The secondary structure of S. cerevisiae Cet1(241­539)p is shown above its amino acid sequence (ScCet1). The sequence of Cet1(241­539)p is aligned to the sequences of the homologous segments of C. albicans Cet1p (CaCet1) and S. cerevisiae Cth1p (ScCth1). Gaps in the alignment are indicated by dashes. Positions of side chain identity and/or similarity in all three fungal RNA triphosphatases are denoted by dots above the aligned sequences. Conserved motifs A, B, and C that define the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatase family are demarcated by the shaded boxes. Protease-sensitive sites within Cet1(241­539)p are denoted by arrowheads.

crystallized a biologically active form of yeast Cet1p and ° determined its structure at 2.05 A resolution. The structure reveals the architecture of the active site, the Cet1p­Cet1p dimer interface, and the surface peptide domain responsible for Cet1p binding to the yeast guanylyltransferase. The catalytic domain adopts a novel enzyme fold in which an antiparallel eight-stranded barrel forms a hydrophilic "triphosphate tunnel" in which motifs A and C comprise the metal-binding site. Results and Discussion Structure of Yeast RNA Triphosphatase The truncated RNA triphosphatase derivative Cet1(241­ 539)p displays full catalytic activity in vitro and suffices for yeast cell growth when the CET1(241­539) gene is expressed in single copy under the control of its natural promoter (Lehman et al., 1999). Structure probing of Cet1p in solution by limited proteolysis showed that the Tyr-241/Arg-242 dipeptide is highly sensitive to chymotryptic cleavage. Additional sites of accessibility to chymotrypsin and trypsin are clustered nearby at Lys-256/ Ala-257, Leu-258/Gln-259, and Lys-264/Asp-265, suggesting that the segment from 241 to 265 is either disordered or surface exposed (Lehman et al., 1999). The distal C-terminal portion of the protein is relatively protease insensitive and likely comprises a folded domain. A homodimeric quaternary structure for N-terminally truncated Cet1p derivatives (e.g., N 200, N 230, and N 240) was suggested based on analysis of the purified recombinant enzymes by glycerol gradient sedimentation (Lehman et al., 1999). To gain further insight into the structure of yeast RNA triphosphatase, we purified and crystallized Cet1(241­ 539)p. The crystals were monoclinic (C2) with three

Cet1(241­539)p monomers in the asymmetric unit. Electron density maps were obtained using multiple isomorphous replacement anomalous scattering methods from ° two mercury derivatives of the crystal. Phases to 2.8 A were improved by density modification procedures. The ° structure was ultimately refined to 2.05 A. Details of the structure determination and refinement are included in Table 1. The model contained 286 of the 299 amino acid residues of the Cet1(241­539)p protein. There was no interpretable electron density for 19 of the 21 amino acids comprising the N-terminal His-tag used to facilitate affinity purification of the protein. Two short surface loops from residues 384­388 and 479­487 had no observable electron density and are therefore absent from the model. Note that the 384­388 loop flanks a site of chymotrypsin sensitivity at Tyr-380/Arg-381 in the native protein (Lehman et al., 1999), suggesting that the disorder of this segment in the crystal faithfully reflects its status in solution. Consistent with solution studies, Cet1(241­539)p crystallized as a dimer with dimensions of 100 50 ° 40 A (Figure 2). The dimer displays two-fold symmetry through the z axis in Figure 2A and the y axis in Figure ° 2B. Each protomer (67 44 40 A) is composed of four helices and 11 strands. The secondary structure elements are displayed over the Cet1p protein sequence in Figure 1. The striking feature of the tertiary structure is the formation of a topologically closed tunnel composed of eight antiparallel strands (Figures 2A and 3). In the dimer, the two tunnels are parallel and oriented in the same direction (i.e., the tunnel "entrances" are on the same face of the dimer). A surface view of the monomer is shown in Figure 4A looking into the tunnel entrance. Rotation of the molecule rightward and leftward about the vertical axis into the plane of the page

provides side views that highlight a platform-like structure in front of the tunnel entrance (Figures 4B and 4D). A view into the back end of the tunnel is shown in Figure 4C. The Cet1p tunnel has an average C to C diameter ° of 18 A and is restricted at its tighest to a side chain to ° side chain diameter of 9 A. A search of the Protein Data Bank using the program DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993) indicated that yeast RNA triphosphatase has a novel fold for an enzyme. The barrel forming the tunnel in Cet1p differs substantially from other barrel structures in the PDB and SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995) databases. Whereas other barrels have hydrophobic interiors (e.g., streptavidin, thrombin subunit H), the inside of the RNA triphosphatase barrel consists of predominantly hydrophilic side chains (Figure 3), including the acidic and basic side chains involved in substrate binding and phosphohydrolase chemistry. Indeed, as we discuss below, the triphosphatase active site is situated within the tunnel. Although the PDB database contains other barrel folds with hydrophilic interiors (e.g., porins), Cet1p appears unique in that it forms a porous barrel using only eight strands, compared to at least 12 for the members of the porin family. The DNA repair enzyme endonuclease IV does contain an eight-stranded barrel (Hosfield et al., 1999), but the component strands are in a parallel orientation, the interior of the barrel is hydrophobic, and the overall 8 8 fold of endonuclease IV is quite different from the fold of Cet1p.

The two proteins most closely related to Cet1p at the primary structure level are CaCet1p and Cth1p. CaCet1p is the RNA triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus of Candida albicans (Yamada-Okabe et al., 1998). Cth1p is a nonessential S. cerevisiae protein with divalent cation-dependent RNA triphosphatase/NTPase activity that may participate in an RNA transaction unrelated to capping (Pei et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 1999). The amino acid sequences of Cet1p, CaCet1p, and Cth1p are aligned in Figure 1. Triphosphatase motifs A, B, and C are highlighted in shaded boxes, and positions of side chain identity or conservation in all three triphosphatases are denoted by dots above the Cet1p sequence. Reference to the secondary structure of Cet1p indicates that the identical and conserved residues are clustered in a subset of the strands, including 1 (which contains motif A), 8, 9 (motif B), 10, and 11 (motif C) (Figure 1). These strands comprise part of the walls of the tunnel (Figures 2 and 3). The residues conserved in all three enzymes are shown in blue on the surface views of the Cet1(241­539)p monomer in Figure 4. The surface-exposed positions of identity and similarity, which include residues essential for catalysis, are localized predominantly in the interior of the tunnel. The Dimer Interface The dimer interface is extensive, with a buried surface ° area of 1860 A2 per Cet1(241­539)p protomer. The dimerization surface (colored green in the space-filling model

in Figure 5) encompasses the underside of the platform (Figure 5B) as well as a knob-like extension that projects downward across the two-fold axis (Figure 5A). Elements that comprise the dimer interface are strands 2 and 3, helices 1 and 4, the loop immediately preceding 1, the loop between 9 and 10, and the loop between 3 and 4. These can be appreciated by reference to the backbone trace of the Cet1(241­539)p protomer in Figure 5 and in the ribbon trace in Figure 2. The molecular contacts of the dimer interface are listed in Table 2. These entail multiple hydrophobic interactions and a network of side chain and main chain hydrogen bonds. The hydrophobic core of the Cet1(241­539)p dimer interface is stabilized by interactions of residues Ile-268, Phe-272, Leu-273, and Pro-277 (located immediately proximal to 1) with hydrophobic residues on the dimer partner located in the segments from 354­368, 463­467, and 519­530 (Table 2). Indeed, the aromatic side chain of Phe-272 inserts into a small hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the dimer partner (Figure 5C). The functional contribution of the peptide segment containing Phe-272 to homodimerization of Cet1p is underscored by the finding that N-terminal deletion of Cet1p up to residue 275 results in a catalytically active, albeit monomeric enzyme (Lehman et al., 1999). The functional relevance of the receiving hydrophobic pocket on the dimer partner is suggested by the isolation of a temperaturesensitive yeast mutant (cet1­1) that contains a single mutation of Ile-530 to threonine (Lehman et al., 1999).

Additional hydrophobic interactions occur between side chains of strand 2 of one protomer (325­330) and strand 3 in the partner (330­334) (Table 2). Main chain hydrogen bonds between 2 and 3 form an antiparallel sheet at the dimer interface (see Figure 2B). The Guanylyltransferase-Binding Domain Yeast RNA triphosphatase forms a heteromeric complex with the yeast RNA guanylyltransferase Ceg1p. The binding of Cet1p to Ceg1p serves two purposes. First, Cet1p­Ceg1p interaction stimulates guanylyltransferase activity by enhancing the affinity of Ceg1p for GTP and increasing the extent of formation of the Ceg1p­ GMP reaction intermediate (Ho et al., 1998a). Second, the physical tethering of Cet1p to Ceg1p facilitates recruitment of the triphosphatase to the RNA polymerase II elongation complex, which occurs via the binding of yeast guanylyltransferase to the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Cho et al., 1997; McCracken et al., 1997). Cet1p by itself does not bind to the phosphorylated CTD (Cho et al., 1998; Ho and S. S., unpublished data). Genetic evidence indicates that the Cet1p­Ceg1p interaction is essential for yeast cell growth (Lehman et al., 1999). Overlapping segments of Cet1p from residues 205 to 265 and 230 to 275 have been implicated in Ceg1p binding using a variety of biochemical and genetic assays (Cho et al., 1998; Lehman et al., 1999). We have recently localized the guanylyltransferase binding and stimulation functions more precisely to a

The view is looking into the tunnel entrance (as in Figure 4A). An enzyme-bound sulfate coordinated within the tunnel is shown as a stick model.

peptide consisting of Cet1p residues 239 to 259 (Ho et al., 1999) (Figure 1). This Ceg1p interaction domain is located entirely on the surface of the Cet1(241­539) structure (colored in red in Figure 5). (Note that the Ceg1p-binding surface does not overlap with the dimer interface colored in green.) The Ceg1p-binding domain includes a PIWAQKW motif that is conserved in the RNA triphosphatase of Candida albicans (Figure 1). A K250AW251A mutation within the PIWAQKW motif elicits a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype that is suppressed by overexpression of the yeast guanylyltransferase (Lehman et al., 1999). The crystal structure reveals that both tryptophan side chains with this motif are exposed on the protein surface. Taken together, the structural, biochemical, and genetic data implicate these aromatic amino acids directly in Ceg1p binding. There is one Ceg1p-binding site on each side of the dimer. Sedimentation analysis indicates that the dimeric Cet1p-N derivatives bind one molecule of Ceg1p (which is itself a monomer in solution) to form a heterotrimeric complex (Lehman et al., 1999). In light of the crystal structure, we suggest that binding of Ceg1p to one surface of the Cet1p­Cet1p dimer sterically precludes binding of a second Ceg1p on the opposite face. The elucidation of the structure of the Ceg1p-binding site may facilitate the design and identification of small molecules that block the essential Cet1p­Ceg1p interaction. The Triphosphate Tunnel The tunnel consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel barrel (Figure 3). The walls of the tunnel are composed of one four-stranded sheet ( 5, 9, 10, and 11) and

one two-stranded sheet ( 7 and 8). Strands 1, 7, and 8 comprise the floor, while strands 5, 6, and 9 form the roof (Figure 2). The loop connecting 8 and 9 traverses the roof and establishes the closed topology of the tunnel. This topology further distinguishes Cet1p from other barrel­containing proteins. Multiple acidic side chains point into the tunnel cavity, including Glu305 and Glu-307 in motif A and Glu-492, Glu-494, and Glu-496 in motif C, each of which is essential for triphosphatase activity (Figure 3). The interior of the tunnel contains a single sulfate ion coordinated by the side chains of Arg-393, Lys-409, Lys-456, and Arg-458 (Figures 3 and 6). Insofar as sulfate is a structural analog of phosphate, we posit that the side chain interactions of the sulfate reflect contacts made by the enzyme with the -phosphate of the triphosphate-terminated RNA and nucleoside triphosphate substrates. Note that Arg393 (in 6), Lys-456 and Arg-458 (in 9), and Lys-409 (in 7) are conserved in CaCet1p and Cth1p (Figure 1). Mutational studies have shown that Lys-456, which contacts the sulfate, is important for Cet1p function in vivo and in vitro. Changing Lys-456 to alanine or glutamine increased the KM for ATP by an order of magnitude; ATP binding was restored when arginine was introduced at this position (Pei et al., 1999). Other conserved basic residues pointing into the tunnel are Lys-309 ( 1, motif A) and Arg-454 ( 9, motif B). Arg-454 forms a salt bridge to Glu-492 (Figure 3). Mutational effects at Glu-492 and Arg-454 suggest that their interaction is important for RNA triphosphatase activity. Mutant E492A is catalytically inactive (Ho et al., 1998). E492D is poorly active (Pei et al., 1999), presumably because the carboxylate of aspartic acid is too far

away to bond optimally with Arg-454. The finding that E492Q is more active than E492D (Pei et al., 1999) implies that hydrogen bonding to Arg-454 can suffice in lieu of an ion pair. Mutations R454A and R454Q reduce triphosphatase activity and elicit a 30-fold increase in the KM for ATP (Pei et al., 1999). Thus, Arg-454 may make additional contacts with either the - or -phosphate when substrate is bound at the active site. Divalent Cation­Binding Site Cet1p activity is strictly dependent on a divalent cation cofactor. The hydrolysis of 5 triphosphate RNA termini is optimal in the presence of magnesium, whereas NTP hydrolysis specifically requires manganese or cobalt (Ho et al., 1998c). The location of a metal-binding site on the enzyme was determined by X-ray diffraction of Cet1(241­539)p crystals that had been soaked in 0.2 M manganese chloride (Table 1). New density corresponding to a manganese ion was discerned within the tunnel cavity (Figure 6A). (Manganese density was also detected when the crystals were soaked in 10 mM manganese chloride, albeit at lower occupancy.) The manganese was coordinated with octahedral geometry to the sulfate, to the side chain carboxylates of essential residues Glu-305, Glu-307, and Glu-496, and to two waters (Figure 6B). The sulfate is apical to Glu-307. Glu-496 is apical to a water that is coordinated by Glu-307. Glu305 is apical to another water that is coordinated by Asp-471 and Glu-494.

The three glutamates that comprise the metal-binding site of yeast RNA triphosphatase are located in motifs A and C, which define the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatase family. Substitution of Glu-305, Glu-307, or Glu496 by alanine, glutamine, or aspartate inactivates Cet1p (Pei et al., 1999). These mutational effects, implying that both the negative charge and the distance of the carboxylate from the main chain are critical for catalysis, are in keeping with the direct contact of these three glutamates to the divalent cation observed in the manganese-soaked Cet1(241­539)p crystal. The motif A and C glutamates are also essential for the activities of vaccinia virus RNA triphosphatase, baculovirus RNA triphosphatase, and yeast Cth1p (Yu et al., 1997; Jin et al., 1998; Pei et al., 1999). Thus, it is likely that motifs A and C comprise the metal-binding site in all members of this enzyme family. Mechanistic Implications The structure of Cet1(241­539)p with bound sulfate and manganese is construed to reflect that of the product complex of enzyme with the hydrolyzed -phosphate. The structure suggests a catalytic mechanism whereby acidic side chains located on the floor of the tunnel coordinate an essential divalent cation that in turn coordinates the -phosphate. The metal ion would activate the -phosphate for attack by water and stabilize a pentacoordinate phosphorane transition state in which the attacking water is apical to the -phosphate leaving

group. Interactions between the sulfate and basic side chains Arg-393, Arg-458, Lys-409, and Lys-456 located on the walls and roof of the tunnel would contribute to the coordination of the -phosphate in the ground state and the stabilization of the negative charge on the -phosphate developed in the transition state. These interactions are illustrated in Figure 6B. ° Preliminary 2.7 A diffraction data collected on Cet1 (241­539)p crystals grown in the presence of AMPPCP suggest that the -phosphate occupies the same site in the tunnel as the sulfate ion in the native crystal and that the - and -phosphates are located on the entrance side of the tunnel relative to the -phosphate. Orienting the nucleotide in the tunnel entrance suggests a role for adjoining regions of the structure in RNA recognition, particularly the platform-like structure seen in Figure 4B. We speculate that the interaction of the Cet1p dimer with Ceg1p may create a binding site for nascent RNA that permits transit of the 5 terminus from the triphosphatase active site to the guanylyltransferase active site without complete release of the polynucleotide between the catalytic steps. Dimeric Cet1(241­539)p contains two equivalent active sites. We suspect that mRNA modification in vivo does not require two functional triphosphatase active sites in the same complex, insofar as overexpression in yeast of a catalytically inactive triphosphatase mutant that still homodimerizes and binds to Ceg1p did not elicit a dominant-negative phenotype (Y. Pei and S. S., unpublished data). Crystallization of the Cet1p­Ceg1p complex should illuminate a rationale for the distinctive architecture of the yeast capping apparatus.

Conclusions The crystal structure of yeast RNA triphosphatase illuminates a novel active site fold for a metal-dependent phosphohydrolase and provides instructive insights into the catalytic mechanism. The strands containing conserved motifs A (ELEMKF) and C (EVELE) comprise the metal-binding site of Cet1p and are likely to do so in other metal-dependent fungal and viral RNA triphosphatases. The structure reveals an extensive Cet1p­Cet1p dimer interface and the surface location of a separate binding site for the RNA guanylyltransferase component of the fungal capping apparatus. Mechanistic and structural divergence between the RNA triphosphatases of fungi and mammals augurs well for effective antifungal therapy targeted at cap formation.
Experimental Procedures Purification of Yeast RNA Triphosphatase His-tagged Cet1(241­539)p was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells under the control of a T7 promoter (Lehman et al., 1999). Cultures were grown at 37 C in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. When the A600 reached 0.55, the cultures were placed on ice and adjusted to 0.4 mM IPTG and 2% ethanol. The cultures were then incubated for 24 hr at 18 C with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at 80 C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 C. The cell pellets from 3.5 l of induced cultures were resuspended in 140 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1.2 M NaCl, 15 mM imidazole, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol). The suspension was lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 Cell Disrupter, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble fraction was mixed with 15 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) for 3 hr. The resin was recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer, and then poured into a column, which was washed with lysis buffer until the

Figure 6. The Triphosphate Tunnel and the Metal-Binding Site (A) Stereo image of the refined 2Fo-Fc density of a cross section of the tunnel in the manganese-soaked crystal. Blue density is contoured at 1.25 . Red density contoured at 4 highlights the sulfate ion (located in the center of the tunnel) and the manganese ion, which is coordinated by acidic side chains projecting from the tunnel floor. (B) Stereo view of a cross section of the tunnel highlighting the network of side chain interactions that coordinate the sulfate and manganese ions. The manganese (blue sphere) interacts with octahedral geometry with the sulfate, Glu-305, Glu-307, Glu-496, and two waters (red spheres). The images were prepared using SETOR (Evans, 1993).

A280 of the effluent was less than 0.08. The column was eluted stepwise with 40 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 50 mM imidazole and 30 ml of buffer A containing 100 mM imidazole, followed by elution with a 70 ml linear gradient of 100 to 500 mM imidazole in buffer A. The polypeptide composition of the column fractions was monitored by SDS­PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad dye-binding reagent with BSA as a standard. The peak fractions of Cet1(241­ 539)p recovered during the imidazole gradient elution were pooled (64 mg of protein) and then diluted 8-fold with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol. This material was batch-adsorbed to 15 ml of phosphocellulose resin, which was poured into a column, washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and then eluted with a 30 ml linear gradient of 200 to 600 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol. The peak fractions of Cet1(241­539)p (45 mg) were pooled and concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration. Aliquots were stored at 80 C and thawed immediately prior to crystallization trials. Crystallization and Data Collection Crystals were grown at 22 C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Cet1(241­539)p (28 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir buffer (0.1 M MES [pH 6.34], 38% saturated (NH4)2SO4, 5 mM DTT). Crystals grew over several weeks to a size of 0.05 0.075 0.15 mm. The crystals were stabilized in 2.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5) for heavy atom and MnCl2 soaks and for preincubation prior to cryo-preservation in stabilization solution containing 30% sucrose. X-ray data used to solve the structure were collected using cryo-preserved crystals at a laboratory copper K source (Rigaku RU200) equipped with a confocal Osmic multilayer system

and a Raxis-IV imaging plate detector system. A higher resolution native data set and a MnCl2 derivative data set were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven, NY) at beamline X4A on an ADSC Quantum-4 detector. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Cet1(241­ ° ° 539)p crystallized in space group C2 (a 121.4 A, b 116.1 A, c ° 82.3 A, 110.3 ). The diffraction limits of the crystal were beyond ° 2.0 A, but high mosaicity ( 1.0) limited the completion of the data. The MnCl2 data were nonisomorphous with previous native data ° corresponding with a change in the unit cell (a 116.4 A, b ° ° 118.7 A, c 85.1 A, 108.1). Structure Determination and Refinement The structure was solved using multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering. The two mercury data sets shared three sites with varying occupancies. Two additional sites were located in the thimerosal derivative by difference Patterson methods. These sites apparently arose from the polymerization of thimerosal from one of the common mercury sites. Initial sites, phases, and maps were calculated using SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999). Difference Pattersons were calculated using phases generated from MLPHARE. All subsequent data processing was accomplished using the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). The maps generated from MLPHARE revealed distinct solvent boundaries, although connectivity and side chain density were poor. Den° sity modification was accomplished using SOLOMON at 2.8 A (Abrahams and Leslie, 1996). Correlation coefficients between the final 2Fo-Fc maps and initial and solvent-flattened maps are reported in Table 1. No noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators were used during density modification, and the resulting maps were of

sufficient quality for independent placement of all three polypeptide chains. The initial trace of three polypeptide chains (ten segments per protomer, 495 of 897 potential residues) were placed into X-PLOR (Brunger et al., 1987) with cross-validation (Brunger, 1992) for simu¨ ¨ lated annealing refinement and positional refinement with tight NCS restraints (Rfree 47.2, R 40.6). The model was rebuilt, additional amino acids were placed into density, and the resolution of refine° ment was extended to 2.25 A. The model consisted of 15 polypeptide chains containing 822 of the 897 potential amino acid residues (Rfree 33.8, R 27.9). Refinement was then transferred to REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) and ARP (Lamzin and Wilson, 1993) to place waters and to complete the building of the Cet1p polypeptide chain. Restrained maximum likelihood refinement proceeded using all available reflections weighted by experimental sigmas. Tight NCS restraints on main chain atoms and medium restraints on the side chain atoms were used throughout refinement. The model contains 562 waters (Rfree 27.8, R 20.2) and has excellent geometry; 89.3% of residues are in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot with none occurring in disallowed regions. The structure of the manganese­Cet1(241­539)p crystal was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (Navaza, 1994). A monomer from the native structure was used as a search model in the manganese­Cet1(241­539)p data set. Three distinct peaks were located in the rotation function. Each of these was placed into translation functions, which ultimately and unambiguously placed all three monomers of Cet1(241­539)p. The initial R factor and correlation coefficient for this solution were 0.326 and 0.795, respectively. This model was placed directly into REFMAC and refined to R 0.23, Rfree 0.29 with tight NCS restraint. Received September 28, 1999; revised October 27, 1999.
