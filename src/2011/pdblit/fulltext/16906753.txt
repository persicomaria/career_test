ABSTRACT: Copper homeostasis is maintained in part by membrane-bound P1B-type ATPases that are found in all organisms and drive the transport of this essential, yet toxic, metal ion across cellular membranes. CopA from Archaeoglobus fulgidus is a hyperthermophilic member of this ATPase subfamily and is homologous to the human Wilson and Menkes disease ATPases. To gain insight into Cu+-ATPase function, the structure of the CopA actuator domain (A-domain) was determined to 1.65 Å resolution. The CopA A-domain functions to couple ATP hydrolysis in the ATP binding domain (ATPBD) with structural rearrangements of critical transmembrane segments. Its fold is quite similar to that of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) A-domain, with the exception of an external loop region. On the basis of sequence and structural comparisons, specific residues that probably interact with the CopA ATPBD have been identified. Comparisons to the Wilson and Menkes disease A-domains reveal the presence of an additional loop that may be associated with regulatory functions in eukaryotic Cu+-ATPases. Finally, several mutations in the Wilson and Menkes disease ATPases occur in the A-domain, and their likely effects on function can be inferred from the CopA A-domain structure.

Cu+-ATPases belong to the family of P1B-type ATPases, a subclass of P-type ATPases that is essential for the distribution and detoxification of transition metal ions (14). Found in all organisms, Cu+-ATPases couple ATP hydrolysis with the transport of Cu+ across membranes. Excess copper, because of its biologically useful redox potential, can generate damaging free radicals and thus must be tightly controlled. In humans, improper function of Cu+ This work was supported by NIGMS Grant GM58518 (A.C.R.) and NSF Grant MCM-0235165 (J.M.A.). M.H.S. was supported by NRSA Fellowship GM073457.

ATPases causes Wilson and Menkes diseases (5). Mutations in the ATP7B gene encoding the Wilson disease ATPase (WND)1 result in the accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. As a consequence, Wilson disease patients suffer from neurologic and hepatic disorders. Conversely, mutations in the Menkes ATPase (MNK), or the ATP7A gene, result in poor copper uptake from the intestine. Ultimately, this copper deficiency manifests itself as neurodegeneration and connective tissue abnormalities. P1B-type ATPases, while maintaining central structural elements common to all P-type ATPases, have a distinct architecture (1, 3, 6). Most significantly, they differ from

Sazinsky et al. characterization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1), a P2-type ATPase (23-26), cannot be readily extrapolated to P1B-ATPases since the two systems differ in overall architecture. The domains present in both, such as the ATPBD and the transmembrane segments involved in ion coordination, share little sequence homology and thus cannot be modeled reliably. To advance the understanding of P1B-type ATPase function, we are using A. fulgidus CopA as a model system. This hyperthermophilic Cu+-ATPase can be heterologously expressed in a fully functional form and contains all of the structural elements required for ATP-driven Cu+ efflux (12, 15, 16, 27). To obtain high-resolution structural information, we are characterizing independently folded cytoplasmic domains associated with ATP hydrolysis and energy transduction (the N-, P-, and A-domains). During the catalytic cycle, these domains undergo critical conformational changes directly coupled to the transmembrane helix rearrangements responsible for ion translocation. We previously determined the crystal structure of the A. fulgidus CopA ATPBD (27). Here we describe the 1.65 Å resolution structure of the cytoplasmic loop between TM4 and TM5, which is structurally, and likely functionally, similar to the A-domain in P2type ATPases. Based on studies of various P2-type ATPases, this domain is expected to undergo significant positional rearrangements upon metal binding and the subsequent transition from the E1P to the E2P catalytic states (28). Analysis of the CopA A-domain structure allows the identification of key catalytic elements, suggests putative regions involved in regulatory interactions, and provides new insight into the structural basis of Wilson and Menkes diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and Purification of the A-Domain. The A. fulgidus CopA A-domain (residues 213-326) was PCR amplified from CopA cDNA contained in a pCRT7/NT-TOPO His vector (Invitrogen) by using the primers 5-GCCCTTGGTCTCTAATGGGGGAGGCCATAAAGAAGCTC-3 and 5-CGGGAAGGTCTCTGCGCTGCCCATCGCGTCCTCGACCAG-3, which introduce 5 and 3 BsaI restriction sites. The purified PCR product and the plasmid pPR-IBA1 (IBA) were digested with BsaI, purified, and ligated to create the plasmid pCOPAD. The final construct contains a 10 amino acid streptactin tag (SAWSHPQFEK) fused to the C-terminus of the protein. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence and accuracy of the A-domain gene fragment in the pCOPAD vector. BL21Star(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells (Invitrogen) carrying the plasmid pSJS1240 encoding for rare tRNAs (tRNAargAGA/AGG and tRNAileAUA) (29) were transformed with pCOPAD and used for heterologous protein expression. Cell cultures were grown at 37 °C in 1 L of Luria-Bertani media supplemented with 20 mg/L chloramphenicol, 70 mg/L spectinomycin, and 100 mg/L carbanocillin. At an OD600 of 0.7, protein expression was induced with 200-500 µM IPTG. After 3-4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 5 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until further use. The cells were thawed in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 50 units of DNase,

their P2-type and P1-type counterparts in the arrangement and number of transmembrane helices. P1B-type ATPases consist of eight transmembrane (TM) helices, several cytosolic loops, and cytosolic N- and C-terminal metal binding domains (MBD) (Figure 1) (1, 6). The large cytoplasmic loop between TM6 and TM7 comprises the ATP binding domain (ATPBD), which includes the phosphorylation (P) and nucleotide binding (N) domains. The region between TM4 and TM5 bears little sequence similarity to the corresponding region in other ATPase subgroups, but because of its length and the presence of a highly conserved TGE(P/X) sequence, it is considered equivalent to the actuator or A-domain of the P2-type ATPases. There is no structural or functional information on the role of the short loop between segments TM2 and TM3. Heavy metal ATPases also have extended cytosolic Nand C-terminal regions that bind metals and differ significantly in sequence and length among the various P1B-ATPase subgroups (1, 7, 8). For Cu+-ATPases, the N-termini comprise one to six metal binding domains (MBDs) that are structurally similar to the cytosolic Atx1-like copper chaperones and contain conserved CXXC metal binding sequences (2, 6, 7, 9). The human WND and MNK proteins contain six N-terminal MBDs, the Drosophila melanogaster homologue contains four, the Saccharomyces cereVisiae and Escherichia coli homologues contain two, and the corresponding protein from the hyperthermophile Archaeoglobus fulgidus has only one MBD. The N-terminal MBDs are not required for ion transport but play a regulatory role by controlling enzyme turnover and the targeting of Cu+ATPases to various membrane compartments in eukaryotes (10-14). Cu+-ATPases, like other P-type ATPases, have transmembrane metal binding sites that coordinate ions during transport. For Cu+-ATPases, these sites consist of strictly conserved residues located in transmembrane fragments TM6, TM7, and TM8, of which all cluster near the ATPBD (1, 15, 16) (Figure 1). The arrangement of the transmembrane metal binding sites relative to the ATPBD is analogous to that found in the better characterized P2type Na,K- and Ca2+-ATPases (4, 17, 18). The Cu+-ATPases follow the Post-Albers catalytic cycle in which metal ion translocation is coupled to phosphorylation of an aspartate residue in the conserved sequence DKTGT (19-22). The conformational changes accompanying Cu+ translocation are not well understood due to the relative absence of detailed structural information on P1Btype ATPases. Moreover, recent progress in structural

Selenomethionine-labeled protein was generated by growing the cells in LeMaster's media (30) supplemented with 10 mg/L selenomethionine. The protein was expressed and purified as described above. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination. The A-domain was crystallized by using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature by combining 2 µL of protein at 10 mg/mL with 1 µL of a precipitant solution comprising 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 1.8 M (NH4)2SO4, and 7.5% glycerol and 1 µL of a microseed solution in the precipitant buffer. Thick rectangular crystals and thin needles appeared within 3-5 days. Prior to data collection, the crystals were transferred to a cryosolution containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 1.8 M (NH4)2SO4, and 25% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 100 K at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) beamlines 5ID and 23ID, which are operated by DND-CAT and SER-CAT, respectively. The crystals belong to the space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a ) 111.3 Å, b ) 29.4 Å, c ) 40.0 Å, and ) 110.5°. The data were either integrated by using HKL2000 (31) or MOSFLM (32) and scaled with SCALEPACK (31) or SCALA (33). The initial phases were determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) using the program SOLVE (34) and the Se peak data set (Table 1). A model of the A-domain was built with XtalView (35), and refinements were carried out with CNS (36) (Table 1). A Ramachandran plot calculation with PROCHECK (37) indicates that 97.9% of the residues occupy the favored regions with the remainder in generously allowed regions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Global Fold. The A-domain comprises ten -strands and two R-helices at the N- and C-termini. These cytosolic helices extend toward the membrane-spanning helices that ordinarily

would be found in the full-length protein (Figure 2). The highly conserved GE sequence (Figure 3) resides in the middle of a 10 amino acid solvent-accessible loop between 6 and 7 (the GE loop). The geometric configuration of the GE loop presumably facilitates interactions with the ATPBD P-domain (38). The other residues conserved among the different P1- and P2-type ATPases localize to the core of the A-domain and are probably important for proper folding. A superimposition of the SERCA1 and CopA A-domains reveals that their folds are highly conserved and have an rms deviation of 1.1 Å between all backbone atoms even though the sequence identity is just 26% (Figure 4). The structural similarity between the CopA and SERCA1 Adomains suggests they may play similar catalytic roles in

their respective full-length proteins. Notably, the CopA A-domain structure differs from representative P2-type pumps in the absence of a 7-10 amino acid loop between 7 and 8 (Figure 3). Crystal structures of SERCA1 indicate that this loop interacts with the ATPBD N-domain in the ATPbound E2 form of the enzyme (24-26, 39). Its absence suggests that this interaction is not crucial for Cu+-ATPase function. Interactions with the ATPBD. During the catalytic cycle, the A-domain of P-type ATPases plays a central role in a complex series of domain movements and interactions that couple ATP hydrolysis with the translocation of ions across the membrane (40-43). By analogy to the SERCA1 structures, specific regions of the CopA A-domain that may interact with the CopA ATPBD can be identified. In the E1 state, the small region between 3 and 4 of the A-domain is likely to interact with the ATPBD P-domain (Figure 5A) (24). Upon conversion to the E2 state, the GE loop is expected to insert into the ATPBD cleft such that the conserved glutamate interacts with the phosphorylated aspartate within the conserved DKTGT loop of the P-domain (23, 28, 38, 39). The relatively long helices at the N- and C-termini of the A-domain, of which only small portions are present in the current crystal structure, provide flexibility and sufficient distance from the transmembrane region to allow the GE and DKTGT loops to interact. In addition, these helices likely form contacts with helices from the P-domain (38). Consistent with these proposed interactions, the GE loop of the CopA A-domain has a relatively negative electrostatic surface potential (Figure 5B) whereas the ATPBD near the conserved DKTGT loop has a slightly

positive electrostatic surface potential that is complementary (Figure 5C) (27). As suggested by the SERCA1 structures (28, 38, 39), the predicted result of these interactions is the displacement of the A-domain and the structural rearrangement of several transmembrane helices. Because of differences in the topologies of the CopA and SERCA1 transmembrane regions, helical movements in the transmembrane region may differ for CopA. Interactions with the MBD. The presence of regulatory domains and phosphorylation sites at the N-termini of various P2-type ATPases suggests functional interactions between this region and the central catalytic loops (44-46). The N-terminal MBDs are unique to P1B-type ATPases (2, 7). Like WND (47), the CopA N-terminal MBD probably receives Cu+ ions from an Atx1-like chaperone. For A. fulgidus CopA, metal binding to this region appears to be necessary for maximum enzyme turnover (15). This kinetic effect suggests that copper binding may affect specific interactions between the MBD and the other cytosolic domains. In the SERCA1 structures, a helix-turn-helix motif at the N-terminus interacts with the surface of the A-domain that is farthest away from the catalytically essential GE loop. Because of this interaction, movements in the A-domain can induce helical changes in TM1 and the subsequent opening of the lumenal ion gates (38). By analogy, copper binding to the CopA MBD may affect interactions with the A-domain and, in turn, rate-limiting conformational transitions. It should also be noted that interactions between the N-terminus and the cytosolic domains may differ depending on the organism. For example, WND MBDs 1-4 interact with the ATPBD N-domain in the absence of copper, presumably through contacts with a 39 amino acid loop not found in prokaryotic Cu+-ATPases (48). The addition of Cu+ alters these interactions and results in WND relocalization from the trans-Golgi network to the cytoplasmic vesicles (10, 48). Sequence comparisons between the A-domains of eukaryotic and prokaryotic Cu+-ATPases indicate that the former have a small, 3-6 amino acid insert between 1 and 2 (Figure 3). This longer loop may be responsible for mediating interactions between the A-domain and the multiple MBDs in eukaryotic Cu+-ATPases.

Structural Significance of A-Domain WND and MNK Mutations. The A-domain structure provides new insight into Wilson and Menkes disease-causing mutations (Figure 3) (5). Mapping these mutations onto the CopA A-domain suggests that 9 of the 12 known missense mutations in WND are located in the interior of the protein. These mutations may therefore affect the folding and stability of the domain rather than specific interactions with other cytosolic loops. This finding is consistent with the observation that pathogenic mutations altering normal protein folding and trafficking are more frequent than those affecting protein function (49). The other three mutations probably disrupt interactions with the ATPBD. Mutations at positions I275 and P279 (I857T and A861T in WND) likely affect the configuration of the GE loop, and the mutation at position L219 (L813Y in WND) in the N-terminal R-helix may sterically prevent interaction with the ATPBD (Figure 5A). For MNK, only two missense mutations are known to localize to the A-domain (50). The first is located at K234 (S833G in MNK), which is the first residue in strand 2. The second occurs at M274 (L873R in MNK) in the GE loop. The S833G mutation may disrupt the A-domain fold and could also affect domain interactions by altering the loop between 1 and 2 that is found only in eukaryotes. Like the WND mutations, the L873R MNK mutation presumably affects the configuration of the GE loop and prevents proper interactions between the actuator and ATP binding domains. In sum, the A. fulgidus CopA A-domain structure offers the first glimpse of an actuator domain from a heavy metal transporting P1B-type ATPase. Despite the low sequence identity, the A-domain fold is highly conserved between CopA and SERCA1, suggesting Cu+-ATPases may utilize a similar sequence of cytoplasmic domain interactions for metal ion transport. Finally, the A-domain structure provides further insight into the molecular basis of Wilson disease and Menkes syndrome mutations.
