Structure of the Substrate Binding Domain of the Thermosome, an Archaeal Group II Chaperonin
Martin Klumpp,* Wolfgang Baumeister,* and Lars-Oliver Essen * Department of Molecular Structural Biology  Department of Membrane Biochemistry Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry Am Klopferspitz 18a, D-82152 Planegg-Martinsried Germany folding activity has been demonstrated in vitro both for thermosomes (Guagliardi et al., 1994) and TRiC/CCT (Frydman et al., 1992; Gao et al., 1992; Yaffe et al., 1992). Together, they constitute group II of the chaperonin family (reviewed by Willison and Horwich, 1996); whereas the tetradecameric chaperonins of bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are members of group I (Ellis, 1992). Although the structure (Braig et al., 1994, 1995) and mechanism of group I chaperonins, especially of GroEL from Escherichia coli, have been studied in great detail (reviewed by Fenton and Horwich, 1997), only low-resolution structural data are available for the group II chaperonins. In GroEL, two heptameric rings form a barrellike structure, 14.5 nm in height and 13.5 nm in diameter, that encloses a large central cavity. Partially folded substrates bind to this central cavity (Langer et al., 1992) mainly by hydrophobic interactions with surface areas of the apical domains of the chaperonin subunits (Fenton et al., 1994). In vitro, the apical domain alone appears to be sufficient to promote the folding of some proteins (Zahn et al., 1996). In the whole molecule, the apical domains are flexibly connected by the intermediate domains to the equatorial domains, which provide most of the connectivity within and between the rings and are responsible for the ATPase activity of the chaperonin. ATP binding to the equatorial domains causes movements of the apical and also the intermediate domains (Roseman et al., 1996), which apparently weaken the interaction with the substrate polypeptide and effect its release. Collective domain movements and substrate release are enhanced by binding of the cochaperonin GroES, a heptameric ring of 10 kDa subunits (Hunt et al., 1996; Mande et al., 1996), to the apical domains of group I chaperonins. This GroES "lid" seals the GroEL cavity and encloses the folding substrate in a so-called "Anfinsen cage" (Saibil et al., 1993). Although the overall domain organization of the subunits (Phipps et al., 1993; Waldmann et al., 1995b), the binding of substrate to the central cavity (Marco et al., 1994; Nitsch et al., 1997), and the ATP-dependent substrate release (Frydman et al., 1992; Gao et al., 1992; Yaffe et al., 1992) are common to group I and group II chaperonins, a GroES-like cochaperonin has been found so far neither in archaea nor in the eukaryotic cytosol. Moreover, only the N- and C-terminal parts of the sequence, which form the equatorial (ATPase) and intermediate domains in GroEL, are highly conserved between group I and group II chaperonins, whereas no significant sequence similarity can be detected between the apical, substrate binding domains of both groups (Kim et al., 1994; Waldmann et al., 1995a). Therefore, two key questions arise for the group II chaperonins: what is the structural basis for their interaction with substrate proteins and how do they sequester them from interaction with the cytosol despite lacking a GroES-like "lid"? To address these questions, we have investigated the substrate binding domain of the subunit of the T. acidophilum thermosome by solving its crystal structure ° at 2.3 A resolution.

Summary The crystal structure of the substrate binding domain of the thermosome, the archaeal group II chaperonin, ° has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. The core resembles the apical domain of GroEL but lacks the hydrophobic residues implied in binding of substrates to group I chaperonins. Rather, a large hydrophobic surface patch is found in a novel helix-turn-helix motif, which is characteristic of all group II chaperonins including the eukaryotic TRiC/CCT complex. Models of the holochaperonin, which are consistent with cryo electron microscopy data, suggest a dual role of this helical protrusion in substrate binding and controlling access to the central cavity independent of a GroESlike cochaperonin. Introduction Hsp60 proteins or chaperonins represent a distinct family of molecular chaperones, which assist in the folding of newly synthesized or the refolding of stress-denatured proteins (Ellis, 1996; Hartl, 1996). Their occurence in all three kingdoms--the archaea, eukarya, and bacteria--bears testimony of an ancient origin. All chaperonins assemble to homo- or heterooligomeric toroidal structures, thus providing large sequestering cavities in which incompletely folded proteins are protected from detrimental interactions amidst the crowded environment of the cytosol. In archaea, the chaperonin/hsp60 family is represented by the thermosomes (Phipps et al., 1991, 1993). These consist of one (e.g., Methanopyrus kandleri; Andra et al., 1996) or two (e.g., Thermoplasma acidophilum ¨ [Waldmann et al., 1995a] and Pyrodictium occultum [Phipps et al., 1991]) types of subunits, which are usually arranged in two eight-membered rings stacked together back-to-back. In the thermosome of Thermoplasma acidophilum, the two subunits ( and ) have recently been shown to alternate within the rings (Nitsch et al., 1997). The thermosome sequences are not only similar to each other (e.g., 63% sequence identity between the T. acidophilum - and subunits), but also to those of the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin TRiC/CCT (Trent et al., 1991). Like the thermosomes, TRiC/CCT (Frydman et al., 1992; Gao et al., 1992; Lewis et al., 1992; Yaffe et al., 1992) forms a hexadecameric complex, albeit of eight different subunits (Kubota et al., 1995).

Results and Discussion Structure of the Substrate Binding Domain A previously performed sequence analysis (Waldmann et al., 1995a) of group II chaperonins in the light of the GroEL crystal structure established the domain boundaries and predicted the absence of two helical regions conserved in all group I apical domains (H11 and H12, according to Braig et al., 1995; see Figure 1). This helixturn-helix motif behaves as a separate folding unit, and its absence does not destabilize a GroEL apical domain fragment comprising residues Glu191­Arg345 expressed in E. coli (Zahn et al., 1996). Based on the thus

established domain boundaries, a soluble fragment comprising the putative substrate binding region of the thermosome subunit (residues Ser214­Asn365) was cloned and subsequently expressed in E. coli. Purified protein was crystallized by vapor diffusion under high salt conditions and at elevated temperature (30 C). A remarkable feature of the crystals was the strong polymorphism with regard to the unit cell dimensions. Two datasets representing the two extremes of this distribution in unit cell size were collected from single crystals, ° one at 2.3 A with synchrotron radiation (form A crystal, ° ° ° P3121, a 82.35 A, c 77.83 A), the other at 2.8 A on a rotating anode X-ray generator (form B crystal, P3121,

helices. In GroEL, these two helices, H8 and H9 (Braig et al., 1995), contain surface-exposed hydrophobic residues involved in substrate binding (Fenton et al., 1994). In the group II chaperonins, the equivalent of H8 is elon° ° gated from 16 A in GroEL to 36 A and forms together with an additional helix, for which there is no equivalent in GroEL, the helix-turn-helix motif protruding from the globular part of the domain. On the interior face of sheet A, a helix (H10 in GroEL) connects sheet A to the four-stranded sheet B, which also contains the N- and C-termini of the domain. The few residues conserved between the apical domains of the thermosome subunit and of GroEL, 21 out of 119, are predominantly found in the hydrophobic core of the sandwich.

The insert shows a structural comparison with the substrate binding domain of the group I chaperonin GroEL (green) as viewed straight on the interhelical cleft region.

° ° a 79.91 A, c 70.25 A). The crystal structure of form A was determined by MIR (see Table 1) and subsequently used to solve the form B crystal structure by molecular replacement. The refined structure of the substrate binding domain contains one monomer per asymmetric unit, which results in a high solvent content of 70% (form A crystals). The domain is unambigously defined in 2F O-FC electron density maps with the exception of the C-terminal hexahistidine tag and a few side chains on the surface of the molecule. The structure shows a globular domain portion with approximate dimensions of 25 30 35 ° ° A3, to which a 25 A long protrusion of two antiparallel helical elements connected by a small loop is attached (Figures 2 and 3A). The overall topology of the globular part resembles the fold of the GroEL apical domain (residues Glu191­ Arg345) (Braig et al., 1995; Zahn et al., 1996). Superposition of both globular domains (Figure 2, insert) on each ° other yields an rmsd value of 1.61 A for 95 equivalent C positions. The -sandwich architecture comprises two orthogonal sheets: sheet A has a topology and is flanked on its exterior face by two antiparallel

Substrate Binding Hydrophobic Surfaces GroEL is supposed to bind its substrates mostly by hydrophobic interactions. Mutations of several exposed hydrophobic residues in the interhelical cleft between H8 and H9 cause loss of both peptide and GroES binding (Fenton et al., 1994). We therefore analyzed the surfaces of the group II apical domains for their hydrophobicity (Figure 4). Surprisingly, most of the positions that are regarded as important for substrate binding in GroEL (marked red in Figure 1) are not occupied by hydrophobic residues in the thermosome or in other group II chaperonins; in fact, the surfaces typically have a rather high density of charges in this region (Figure 4, right). For example, instead of the leucines at positions 234 and 237 of GroEL, the thermosome contains Glu278 and Lys281, which participate in a network of salt bridges that occludes the interhelical cleft. Unless group II chaperonins interact with their substrates predominantly by electrostatic forces or hydrogen bonds, for which there is no evidence, this region alone appears not to be suitable for substrate binding. There are a number of exposed hydrophobic residues on the surface of the group II apical domains, which cluster in two areas. One of these is located next to the N- and C termini, which in the whole molecule would be covalently connected to the intermediate domain. A comparison with the structure of the GroEL complex (Braig et al., 1994) suggests that this interdomain contact also includes noncovalent, hydrophobic interactions from the region around the termini, which appears surface exposed in our construct but would be inaccessible to substrate polypeptides in the whole thermosome. The other more conspicuous cluster of surfaceexposed hydrophobic residues is found in the helixturn-helix protrusion mentioned above (Figure 4, left). This novel feature is highly conserved among the various thermosome and TRiC/CCT subunits (Figure 1), arguing for an important role in group II chaperonins. Most of the hydrophobic residues in this region mediate the interaction between the two helices, but this is insufficient to bury them completely. Several side chains are located in a shallow groove that would be easily accessible even to polypeptide segments with significant secondary structure (Figure 3A). This is indicated by the extensive contacts between the helical protrusions from two symmetry-related domains in the crystal. Together, the two

Residues conserved throughout the group II chaperonins are labeled (compare Figure 1). (B) Flexibility of the helical protrusion as shown by the two crystal forms A (yellow) and B (orange). Residue Tyr301 is shown for illustrating conformational changes transmitted from the helical protrusions to the interhelical cleft region.

symmetry-related helix-turn-helix motifs form a fourhelix bundle stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. It has been postulated that hydrophobic interactions govern substrate binding by group II chaperonins as they do for group I chaperonins and other chaperones (Guagliardi et al., 1994; Dobrzynski et al., 1996). Therefore, the helical protrusion appears to be the most likely substrate binding site. Despite some variability in the sequences of the helical protrusion, its pattern of hydrophobicity is well conserved in all of the thermosome and TRiC/ CCT subunits (Figures 1 and 4). The sequence variation found in this region presumably represents a means to generate some substrate binding specificity. Conformational Flexibility The lack of secondary interactions between the helical protrusion and the globular domain portion suggests that the helical protrusion exhibits some flexibility. Analysis of form B crystals demonstrates that there is indeed at least segmental flexibility of the helical protrusion: both crystal forms differ by a 20 rotation of the helical protrusion that causes a translational shift of up to 7 ° A at the tip of the helical protrusion. In addition, the movement of the helical protrusion leads to conformational changes in the globular domain portion. Most prominently, the side chain of Tyr301 in the interhelical cleft region flips around-- 1 changes from 63 to 170 (Figure 3B)--causing compensatory changes in the conformations of surrounding residues. Nevertheless, the surface in this area retains its hydrophilic character. The conformational flexibility of the helical protrusion might well be necessary to allow the chaperonin to accomodate various substrates. The substrate binding interhelical cleft of GroEL also appears to be highly flexible. However, in GroEL the flexibility is reflected mainly by the high temperature factors in the crystal structure of the intact GroEL

complex. In the group II structure, the residues at the putative substrate binding site are among those with the lowest temperature factors, most likely because this region is fixed by the extensive crystal contact described above. The highest temperature factors of the apical domain were found in a loop region comprising residues Asp332­Asp335, and some side chains in this loop were not resolved. An exception is Leu333, whose side chain anchors the loop to the hydrophobic core and contacts the base of the helical protrusion. If this residue served as some kind of support for the hinge between the protrusion and the rest of the molecule, then the movement of the protrusion might be transmitted to the loop Ile329­ Ser339 and cause its distortion. The equivalent loop of GroEL (residues Val300­Asp316) is longer and displays similarly increased flexibility (Braig et al., 1995). By mutagenesis, a function in GroES but not in substrate binding was attributed to this loop region. The other GroEL residues involved in binding of GroES also correspond to thermosome residues near the site where the helical protrusion emanates. The presence of this feature therefore appears incompatible with binding of a GroES-like cochaperonin. In fact, no cochaperonin has yet been identified for group II chaperonins despite the complete sequencing of both an archaeal (Methanococcus jannaschii) and eukaryotic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome. A previous electron microscopic 3-D reconstruction of the thermosome from P. occultum gave first hints that a GroES-like function might be implemented in the group II chaperonins themselves (Phipps et al., 1993). Such an integration of chaperonin and cochaperonin functions into a single polypeptide chain is likely to result in a different mechanism of substrate binding and release, in which the helical protrusion of group II chaperonins might fulfill some of the roles that GroES has in group I chaperonins (discussed below).

Figure 4. Hydrophobicity of the Surface Regions on Group I and Group II Chaperonins Surface representations of the substrate binding domains of the thermosome subunit and GroEL were generated with an increased ° probe radius of 4 A using the program GRASP (Nicholls, 1992). For orientation, C -backbones (thermosome, yellow; GroEL, green) are shown beneath the surfaces. The surfaces are color coded according to the underlying average hydrophobicity found for surfaceexposed residues of group I and group II chaperonins (hydrophobicity scale as in Sharp et al., 1991; red, hydrophobic; blue, hydrophilic). The interhelical cleft is marked by white arrows.

Function of the Substrate Binding Domain in Group II Chaperonins Previous cryo electron microscopic studies on the T. acidophilum thermosome revealed its symmetry and subunit arrangement (Nitsch et al., 1997). The high sequence similarity found for the equatorial and intermediate domains of group I and group II chaperonins (Kim et al., 1994; Waldmann et al., 1995a) suggests that the equatorial domains in the octameric rings of group II chaperonins are arranged in a similar fashion as in the heptameric rings of GroEL. Taken together, this allowed us to model an -only thermosome by assuming internal 82 symmetry of the complex, a conserved fold of equatorial and intermediate domains and intersubunit contacts similar to those in GroEL. The absence of a group II equivalent for GroEL helices H11 and H12 suggested that the interactions between neighboring apical domains might differ from those in group I chaperonins. In fact, Tyr360, which is positioned in the turn connecting these two helices, contributes in GroEL two out of seven interactions to a contact with the intermediate domain of a neighboring subunit. The weakening of this contact should give the group II apical domains an even greater freedom of motion than in GroEL, where two hinges for

domain movements have been identified by cryo EM (Roseman et al., 1996). Rotation around hinge 1, which is located between the equatorial and intermediate domains, leads to an opening of the complex similar to the petals of a flower; rotation around hinge 2, which connects the intermediate and apical domain, affects the orientation rather than the localization of the apical domain. In group II chaperonins, the attachment point of the helical protrusion might constitute a third hinge, as visualized by the crystal forms A and B (Figure 3B), which further increases their conformational flexibility compared to group I. Information about the conformation of the holochaperonin can be derived from electron microscopy, ideally from frozen hydrated complexes. Side views of -only thermosomes obtained by cryo EM (Nitsch et al., 1997) were consistent with a model where a 40 rotation around hinge 1 leads to an opening of the complex (Figure 5). The orientation of the apical domains in this model causes the helical protrusions to point upward and inward in a clockwise arrangement, resembling an iris-type aperture. The surface of the helical protrusions facing the central cavity is largely hydrophobic and is well positioned to interact with a substrate protein. The flexibility of the helical protrusions would allow accomodation of a variety of different substrates. Indeed, the observed (Figure 5D) but not the calculated (Figure 5C, right) side views of the thermosome show an additional, relatively diffuse density between their apical domains, which we suggest in line with our earlier interpretation (Nitsch et al., 1997) to represent the center of mass of residual bound substrate rather than an integral part of the thermosome. In this substrate binding conformation, the cavity appears quite open (approximately 8 nm between the tips of opposite protrusions). However, it is unclear at present exactly in which state of the functional cycle the thermosomes have been frozen during sample preparation. Furthermore, the domains are likely to undergo major rearrangements as a consequence of nucleotide binding. For TRiC/CCT, some conformational changes have been observed after addition of Mg-ATP (Marco et al., 1994; Melki et al., 1997), but a detailed interpretation by a structural model is impossible, owing to the limited resolution of the 2-D projections derived from negatively stained particles. In a more closed conformation (Figure 5C, left), the conformational flexibility of the helical protrusions might allow them to occlude most of the central cavity. This suggests that, in addition to their role in substrate binding, they might control access to and exit from the central cavity much like the cochaperonin GroES does for GroEL. When GroES seals off the central cavity of GroEL, it simultaneously displaces the substrate from its binding site by binding to the hydrophobic residues in the interhelical cleft (Xu et al., 1997). One might envision an analogous mechanism for group II chaperonins, in which the hydrophobic surfaces in the helical protrusion shed their substrates owing to preferential interactions with neighboring subunits during the transition to a more closed conformation. Clearly, more detailed, three-dimensional studies of group II chaperonins in defined functional states are required to fully understand the role of the various conformations for the mechanism of group II chaperonins.

From the atomic coordinates of the models, a 3-D electron density was calculated at 2 nm resolution by the program PDB2DENS (J. Walz). After axial symmetrization, a 2-D projection was calculated using the EM program package (Hegerl, 1996). Shown are models with 0 , 20 , and 40 rotation around hinge 1, which is marked by the white arrow. (D) Thermosome side view observed by electron microscopy. Side views (450) of -only thermosomes embedded in vitreous ice were aligned translationally and rotationally as described (Nitsch et al., 1997). Subsequently, the resulting average was 2-fold symmetrized using the EM program package.

Experimental Procedures Expression and Purification Based on a previously published alignment of group II chaperonins (Waldmann et al., 1995a), an expression cassette for the apical domain of the thermosome subunit (residues Ser214­Asn365) fused to a C-terminal His6-tag was generated by PCR primers ATAA GCCATATGAGCGGTATCGTCATACAGAAGG and AAATAAGAATTC TCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGATTCTTGCATCC and cloned into the EcoRI and NdeI sites of pRSET6a. Expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) was performed as described for intact recombinant thermosomes (Waldmann et al., 1995c). The apical domain was purified at 4 C on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Fractions containing the apical domain were pooled, and the buffer was changed to 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8) with PD10 columns (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). DTT, EDTA, and sodium azide were added to 1 mM. The protein was applied to a Fractogel DMAE column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8), 1 mM sodium azide. Whereas the apical domain did not bind to the column, impurities were efficiently retained. The flow-through was pooled, sterile filtered, and used in crystallization experiments. By analytical gel filtration on Superdex75 (Pharmacia), the monomeric state of the apical domains was confirmed. Crystallization and Structure Determination Crystals of the apical domain were grown at 30 C by vapor diffusion (27 mg/ml protein, 3.0 M (NH4 )2 SO4 , 0.1 M sodium citrate [pH 3.8]).

Some precipitate initially formed was consumed during crystal growth (2­4 weeks). Data were collected at 100 K on a 30 cm MAR research imaging plate using 4 M sodium phosphate (pH 3.5) as freezing and soaking buffer. Data processing and scaling were done with the HKL package. MIR phases of form A crystals were calcu° lated at 3.6 A resolution with the program MLPHARE (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994) and subjected to refinement ° by solvent flipping and phase extension to 2.8 A with SOLOMON (Abrahams and Leslie, 1996). The model was built into the electron density map by using the graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991) and finally refined with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). The final model of ¨ the form A crystal structure included residues Ser214­Lys364 of the thermosome subunit (except side chains for residues Lys323, Lys328, Asp332, Asp334, and Asp335). The crystal structure of form B was solved with the globular domain portion of the form A structure by molecular replacement using AMORE (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994). The helical protrusion was rebuilt from SIGMAA-weighted electron density maps using an ethyl-mercury chloride derivative for additional phase information. Finally, the form B structure was subjected to refinement with X-PLOR using ° data up to 2.8 A resolution (for statistics, see Table 1). Secondary Structure Assignment and Sequence Alignment Secondary structure was assigned to the apical domains of the ° thermosome subunit (this study; 2.3 A resolution) and of GroEL ° (PDB entry 1jon, 2.5 A resolution; Zahn et al., 1996) by the program DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). In the flanking regions of GroEL, ° the assignment was based on PDB entry 1oel (2.8 A resolution) (Braig

et al., 1995). The GroEL sequence was taken from SWISSPROT entry P06139. The apical domain of the thermosome subunit was structurally superimposed to that of GroEL by the program GA-Fit (May and Johnson, 1994). In the flanking regions, the alignment was taken from Waldmann et al. (1995a) and used to attribute secondary structure. By visual inspection, minor modifications of the alignment were made in order to avoid disruption of secondary structure elements and to take topological equivalency into account. Subsequently, the alignment (Waldmann et al., 1995a) of the thermosome and murine TRiC/CCT subunits (SWISSPROT entries P11983, P80314, P80318, P80315, P80316, P80317, P80313, P42932, P48425, and P48424, shown from top to bottom in Figure 1) was adjusted according to the structural elements observed in the crystal structure of the thermosome subunit apical domain. The secondary structural elements and the improved alignment are shown in Figure 1. Surface Hydrophobicity of Chaperonin Apical Domains In order to compare the average surface hydrophobicity of group II and group I chaperonins, multiple sequence alignments were prepared for each group. An average hydrophobicity was then derived for each position in the sequence by using the number of residues occurring at a certain position as weight and by using the corrected hydrophobicity scale from Sharp et al. (1991) as scale parameter. The sequence alignment for group II chaperonins included sequences from M. kandleri (P50016), Pyrococcus sp. (Q52500), Sulfolobus shibatae (P28488 and P46219), M. jannaschii (Q58405), and Desulfurococcus (GenBank entry S79557) in addition to those shown in Figure 1. The sequence alignment of group I chaperonins included GroEL and the SWISSPROT entries P10809, P30779, P16625, P19882, P25420, P29197, P27575, P17203, P22879, P08823, P21241, P06806 and P28598. The average hydrophobicity values thus obtained were used to color surface representations of the thermosome and GroEL substrate binding domains (Figure 4). Modeling of Thermosome Complex Molecular modeling of the hexadecameric thermosome complex from the tetradecameric GroEL complex structure (PDB entry 1oel) assumed primarily preservation of intra- and inter-ring contacts made by the conserved equatorial ATPase domains. For this purpose, the GroEL complex was centered in the origin and oriented with its barrel axis colinear with the z axis. Monomer A was translated ° by 6.6 A in the xy plane to account for the greater diameter of the thermosome's octameric ring. The apical domain of GroEL monomer A (residues Glu191­Leu372) was replaced by the apical domain of the thermosome (form A crystal structure) based on the superposition of the globular cores. Application of an 8-fold symmetry operator along z and a 2-fold operator in the xy plane on this hybrid subunit generated the model of the intact thermosome. The orientation of apical domains in the thermosome model was manipulated by applying the two-hinge model of GroEL (Roseman et al., 1996) before the whole thermosome was reconstructed from the hybrid subunit. For hinge 1, the apical and intermediate domains were rotated in 5 steps around an axis chosen to be perpendicular to a plane spanned by the C atoms of Val136, Pro137, and Gly410. A 40 rotation around hinge 1 produced the best agreement between a calculated 2-D projection of the model (Figure 5C) and the experimentally observed side view of the -only thermosome (Figure 5D). Additional rotation around hinge 2 did not result in any apparent improvement of the match and therefore was not applied. Acknowledgments We thank A. Lupas and J. Walz for discussion, R.
