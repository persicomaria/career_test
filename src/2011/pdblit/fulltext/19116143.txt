The esterase/lipase family (EC 3.1.1.3/EC 3.1.1.1) represents a diverse group of hydrolases that catalyze the cleavage of ester bonds and are widely distributed in animals, plants and microorganisms. Among these enzymes, hormone-sensitive lipases, play a critical role in the regulation of rodent fat cell lipolysis and are regarded as adipose tissue-specific enzymes. Recently, we reported the structural and biological characterization of EstE5 from the metagenome library [K.H. Nam, M.Y. Kim, S.J. Kim, A. Priyadarshi, W.H. Lee, K.Y. Hwang, Structural and functional analysis of a novel EstE5 belonging to the subfamily of hormone-sensitive lipase, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 379 (2009) 553­556]. The structure of this protein revealed that it belongs to the HSL-family. Here, we report the inhibition of the activity of the HSLhomolog EstE5 protein as determined by the use of esterase/lipase inhibitors. Our results revealed that the EstE5 protein is significantly inhibited by PMSF. In addition, this is the first study to identify the crystal structures of EstE5­PMSF at 2.4 and 2.5 Å among the HSL-homolog structures. This structural configuration is similar to that adopted when serine proteases are inhibited by PMSF. The results presented here provide valuable information regarding the properties of the HSL-family. Ó 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction Esterases and lipases, which are found in all organisms, are hydrolase enzymes that hydrolyze ester bonds into acids and alcohols. Esterases are classified based on their specificity for the acid moiety of the substrate and their structure and biological function. Lipases also belong to this group of hydrolytic enzymes [1,2]. While esterases preferentially break the ester bonds of shorter chain fatty acids, lipases attack a much broader range of substrates. Esterases prefer substrates that are water soluble, whereas lipases prefer aggregated insoluble substrates [1]. Among the various esterases and lipases, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was first recognized as the enzyme responsible for lipolysis in white adipose tissue, which occurs via the hydrolysis of triacyl and diacyl glycerols. When HSL was identified, it was already known that lipolysis was subject to hormonal control. Accordingly, the lipase activity that increased in response to hormonal treatments was deemed hormone-sensitive [3]. Hormonal activation of HSL occurs via cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Because HSL is the enzyme responsible for the release of free fatty acids (FFA) from adipose tissue, it is believed to play a critical role in providing the major source of energy for most tissues [4].

this reason, the number of studies evaluating the usefulness of HSL and other esterases for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications is increasing. Of particular interest are their stereoselective catalytic properties that are useful in the synthesis of optically pure molecules [5]. Several HSL-homolog protein structures have been determined, which have provided structural and mechanistic details about the protein [6­10]. Nevertheless, many questions regarding the detailed molecular structure of HSL remain outstanding. Recently, we isolated the gene for EstE5 and expressed, characterized and studied its kinetic constants and stability; The Km and Vmax values of the EstE5 enzyme for p-nitrophenyl butyrate were 1.06 mM and 493.6 lM/min, respectively [10]. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of EstE5; revealing that it belongs to the HSL-family [10]. The catalytic mechanism of esterases is similar to that of the serine proteases. Specifically, both enzyme families use the same a/b hydrolase fold for catalysis, which includes a Ser-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad that forms a charge-relay system [4,11,12] (Fig. 1). Here, we characterize the inactivation of EstE5 using esterase/lipase inhibitors and show that PMSF is a significant inhibitor. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of EstE5­PMSF; revealing that PMSF is bound covalently to the nucleophilic Ser144 that is the catalytic residue. We anticipate that these results will provide useful insights for the understanding of molecular mechanism of HSL-homolog proteins.

Materials and methods Protein production and purification. EstE5 was cloned, purified and crystallized from the metagenome library (Accession No. DQ842023) as described previously [10]. Briefly, hexahistidinetagged EstE5 was cloned into the pET21a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The protein was then purified using a two-step purification protocol that consisted of affinity and sizeexclusion chromatography. After the Ni-affinity chromatography step, the protein was purified on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex-200 prep-grade column (GE Healthcare) using an elution buffer composed of 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT. The purified protein was then concentrated to 5 mg/ml for inhibition experiments and to 30 mg/ml for crystallization. Crystallization, X-ray data collection and structural determination. Crystals that were suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained using 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 2.2 M ammonium sulfate and 0.2 M lithium sulfate using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, at 22 °C. PMSF was soaked into the crystallized drop as a powder (2 mg) rather than as a solution, to prevent the effects of the organic solvents. X-ray diffraction data were collected using beamline 4A at PLS (Pohang, Korea). The data were processed using HKL2000 [13]. The crystal structure of EstE5­PMSF was determined by molecular replacement using a wild-type EstE5 structure that had been reported previously (Protein Data Bank code 3FAK) as a search model with the program CNS [14]. The structure was

then refined using CNS [14]. Iterative cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding in Coot were conducted until the free R-factor converged [15]. During the structural refinement, no unclear Fo À Fc electron densities were identified. The final structure was refined using TLS & Refmac from the CCP4 program suite [16]. Stereochemical checks were conducted using PROCHECK [17]. The DALI server was used to search the Protein Data Bank for structural homologs of the EstE5 catalytic domain [18]. The structure was visualized using PyMOL [19]. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Enzyme inhibition. The purified EstE5 protein was incubated in 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 7.5) at 30 °C for 30 min with 1 or 5 mM of enzymatic inhibitors including BME (b-mercaptoethanol), DTT (dithiothreitol), EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), EGTA (ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid), DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) and PMSF (phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride) [20]. The esterase activity was measured by spectrophotometric assay using 0.6 mM of pnitrophenyl butyrate as the substrate at pH 8.5 and 35 °C [10]. Accession code. The final coordinates and structural factors of EstE5­PMSF have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank under the accession codes 3H17 (data I) and 3H18 (data II). Results and discussion We examined the effect of the previously reported inhibitors of esterases and lipases, including BME, DTT, EDTA, EGTA, DEPC and

PMSF, on the activity of EstE5 [7,20] (Table 2). The relative activity of EstE5 showed that the hydrolytic activity of EstE5 was inhibited by 1 mM and 5 mM EDTA (82% and 64% inhibition at 1 mM and 5 mM concentrations, respectively) and by PMSF (1% and 2% inhibition at 1 mM and 5 mM concentrations, respectively). However, no effect on the esterase activity was observed in response to treatment with DEPC, DTT or BME, whereas the esterase activity increased by 104% and 132% in response to treatment with 1 mM and 5 mM EGTA, respectively. These findings show that the EstE5 protein was significantly inhibited by PMSF, suggesting that the nucleophile serine of the charge-relay system moiety is inhibited by PMSF. However, no direct structural evidence exists for the binding of PMSF to the active site of the HSL-homolog family. We therefore determined to establish the crystal structure of EstE5­ PMSF in this study. A detailed description of the structural and biological characteristics of EstE5 has been reported previously [10]. Here, we describe the crystal structure of EstE5 complexed with PMSF. The presence of the PMSF molecule was confirmed using the composite annealed omit maps. The EstE5­PMSF structure belongs to a typical a/b fold and has an overall structure that is similar to that of native EstE5. EstE5­PMSF also contains the CAP (or regulatory) and catalytic domains, which are involved in substrate recognition and catalytic activity, respectively [9,10]. Two EstE5­PMSF structures had an r.m.s. deviation of 0.06 Å for 178 Cas (Glu5-Ala190 and Asn200Trp295). Interestingly, the loop region (Met193­196) between a6 and a7 under the CAP domain are clearly disordered, whereas in the native structure, this region has high B-factors (Fig. 2A). This region contained a small pore that forms the exit for small fragments of the substrate, i.e., acid or alcohol. Based on these findings, we suggest that this region enables the catalytic products to exit (Fig. 2A). The geometries of most of the residues were within the acceptable regions, except for Ser144 in the catalytic triad. The dihedral phi and psi angles of Ser144 were approximately 60° and 120°, respectively. In general, this geometry is ill-refined in esterases

and lipases, but its conformation is stabilized by an intricate hydrogen bond network, including bonds formed between the Nd atom of His268 and the Oe atoms of Glu238 (or the Od atom of Asp), which enables His268 to act as the proton carrier and Glu238 to act as the charge-relay. In the crystal structure of EstE5, the nucleophilic Ser144 is stabilized by an approximately 1.6 Å long, covalent bond to the sulfate center in PMSF. Thus, the Oc atom of Ser144 forms o-benzylsulfonyl-serine (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the Nd atom of His138 was also putatively stabilized by coordination at a distance of approximately 3.0 Å. An oxygen atom of the sulfonyl group in PMSF interacted with the backbone N atoms of Gly76 and the Gly77 at distances of approximately 2.7 and 3.0 Å, whereas the other oxygen atom was not hydrogenbonded. The benzyl group of PMSF points toward the hydrophobic tunnel and is weakly stabilized by two Ce atoms of Met80 and Met202 (data not shown). The average temperature factors of the sulfonyl and benzyl group regions of PMSF in the final model structure were 44.28 (35.75; in data II) and 54.57 (42.60) Å2, respectively, whereas the average temperature factor of the main-chain atoms of the binding pocket of EstE5 was 49.63 (38.68) Å2. Therefore, the sulfonyl group of PMSF has a tightly defined position, whereas the benzyl group is held relatively weakly in the pocket. We did however, observe an unclear Fo À Fc electron density map (it counted at 3r) near the catalytic triad (Fig. 2B), close to the benzyl group in PMSF. When we added the PMSF molecule to this density map, the temperature factor value revealed an acceptance value of 48.54 Å2. However, we believe that the PMSF that we modeled in this unclear density map is a crystallographic artifact, as it has poor electron density shape and coordination, and a poor relationship with its neighboring residues. In any case, the HSL-homolog EstE5 shows a typical configuration for the covalent bonding between a nucleophile serine and PMSF that is similar to that found in other serine proteases. Therefore, the structures of the charge-relay system in native EstE5 and in the PMSF complex are similar, and the conformational change induced by PMSF is minor (Fig. 2C). We compared the structure of EstE5 to those of the carboxylesterase­PMSF from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PDB code: 1AUR), the thioesterase (domain)­PMSF from Bacillus subtilis (2CBG) and the dienelactone hydrolase­PMSF from Pseudomonas putida (1ZIY). Overall, each of these proteins had a different structure, but the catalytic triads and the G-X-S-X-G motifs were identical (Fig. 3A). These structures share a common charge-relay system that functions via the Ser-His-Asp/Glu triad in the active site, thereby allowing charge-relay to occur. In the dienelactone hydrolase­PMSF structure, the conformation changed, disrupting the charge-relay system (Fig. 3B). The catalytic residues in the thioesterase­PMSF structure had positions that were similar to the native structure,

The electron density map (in gray) is shown using the final sigma Aweighted 2Fo À Fc electron density map, contoured at 1r. (B) The flexible region between a6 and a7 was located near the active site. In the structures of the native and PMSFcomplexes, these regions have high B-factors and are highly disordered, respectively. Based on the structure, we suggest that this flexible region allows the substrate fragment to exit the flexible region of the CAP domain. The flexible regions in the catalytic- and CAP domains are shown in orange and yellow, respectively. (C) Superimposed native and PMSF complex structures. The charge-relay system in the PMSF structure was loosely maintained. The structure of the PMSF complex and the native structure are colored cyan and light blue, respectively, in all figures.

but the side chains in the catalytic residues shifted, disrupting the charge-relay system. Conversely, the residues in the structures of EstE5­PMSF complex and the carboxylesterase­PMSF complex were found in similar positions as in the native structures, and distances that make the charge-relay interactions possible. Although histidine and glutamate (or aspartate) have similar configurations in the charge-relay system, distance analysis revealed that the nucleophilic serine residue of both structures is likely to be covalently bound. Thus, PMSF inhibits the catalytic serine residues in both structures. In each of the structures, the sulfonyl center of PMSF forms a covalent bond with the nucleophile at a distance of approximately 1.6 Å. Based on the structure, the serine residue is prevented from acting as a nucleophile (Fig. 3C). The benzyl group of PMSF in the EstE5 complex had a different configuration than that in the carboxylesterase­PMSF complex. We found that the benzyl group of PMSF is close to hydrophobic residues around the fold, which suggests that the orientation of the benzyl group is dependent on the surrounding residues. In summary, we have examined the inhibition of EstE5 and found that PMSF is a significant inhibitor of its esterase activity. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of EstE5­PMSF, in which the nucleophilic Ser144 of the catalytic triad and the sulfonyl center of PMSF form a covalent bond. The structural configuration of this complex is similar to that of the serine proteases. The structure of EstE5­PMSF has significant implications for drug discovery efforts.
