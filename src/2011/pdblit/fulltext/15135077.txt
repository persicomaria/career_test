Domain Organization and Polarity of Tail Needle GP26 in the Portal Vertex Structure of Bacteriophage P22

Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 750, E. Adams Street, Syracuse, NY, 13210, USA The attachment of tailed bacteriophages to the host cell wall as well as the penetration and injection of the viral genome into the host is mediated by the virion tail complex. In phage P22, a member of the Podoviridae family that infects Salmonella enterica, the tail contains an 220 Å elongated protein needle, previously identified as tail accessory factor gp26. Together with tail factors gp4 and gp10, gp26 is critical to close the portal protein channel and retain the viral DNA inside the capsid. By virtue of its topology and position in the virion, the tail needle gp26 is thought to function as a penetrating device to perforate the Salmonella cell wall. Here, we define the domain organization of gp26, characterize the structural determinants for its stability, and define the polarity of the gp26 assembly into the phage portal vertex structure. We have found that the N-terminal 27 residues of gp26 form a functional domain that, although not required for gp26 trimerization and overall stability, is essential for the correct attachment to gp10, which is thought to plug the portal vertex structure. The region downstream of domain I, domain II, folds into helical core, which exhibits four trimerization octad repeats with consensus Ile-xx-Leu-xxx-Val/Tyr. We demonstrate that in vitro, domain II represents the main self-assembling, highly stable trimerization core of gp26, which retains a folded conformation both in an anhydrous environment and in the presence of 10% SDS. The C terminus of gp26, immediately downstream of domain II, contains a -sheet-rich region, domain III, and a short coiled coil, domain IV, which, although not required for gp26 trimerization, enhance its thermodynamic stability. We propose that domains III and IVof the tail needle form the tip utilized by the phage to penetrate the host cell wall.

Introduction
Bacteriophage P22 is a double stranded DNA virus of the Podoviridae family that infects the Gramnegative bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The mature virion consists of a  650 Å icosahedral capsid that encapsidates 43.5 kb of viral genome. A short tail apparatus occupies a unique fivefold vertex of the icosahedral capsid and projects  320 Å outside the capsid surface.1,2 The phage tail,

also referred to as the portal vertex structure, has an overall molecular mass of 2.8 MDa and is formed by five virally encoded polypeptide chains.3 This includes a dodecamer of portal protein gp1,4 six copies of tail spike gp9,1,5 12 copies of gp4,1,6 a hexamer of gp10, 1 and a trimer of gp26. 1,7 The virus tail possesses various biological functions that are essential to the phage life-cycle. The tail spike gp9 mediates adhesion to the Salmonella lipopolysaccharide network emanating from the surface of the host cell wall,8 while the portal protein, gp1, directs bi-directional movement of the viral DNA in and out of the capsid.4 In turn, tail accessory factors gp4, gp10, and gp26 (also known as portal closure or head completion proteins) are essential for stabilization of DNA inside the virus capsid.9 P22 phages deleted at

375 gested that the structure of gp26 can be divided into four sub-domains, illustrated in Figure 1(a). Domain I spans residues 1­27 and is enriched in hydrophobic residues predicted to adopt a random coil conformation. Domain II, residues 28­140, is predicted to fold in a continuous, trimeric coiled-coil -helical core, which presents four well-conserved trimerization motifs.7 Domain III, residues 141­200, immediately downstream of the helical core is enriched in amino acids with small polar side-chains, such as serine or threonine, commonly found in -hairpins.16 Finally, domain IV encompasses C-terminal residues 201­ 233 and, similar to domain II, contains a trimerization motif and has a high propensity to form an helical coiled coil. Trimerization of tail needle gp26 is mediated by the -helical domain II To determine the contribution of individual gp26 sub-domains to the overall structural stability and trimerization of the tail needle, we generated deletion fragments of gp26 lacking either the N-terminal domains I and II or the C-terminal domains III and IV (called N27, N141, and C93, C33, respectively) (Figure 1(a)). All gp26 deletion fragments were over-expressed in Escherichia coli and, similarly to the full-length protein, purified from soluble E. coli lysates. On SDS-PAGE, gp26 deletion constructs containing domain II migrated as trimers, if not boiled before electrophoretic separation (Figure 1(b)). As the Laemmli sample buffer used in the electrophoretic separation contains 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 17 trimeric migration indicated resistance to SDS-induced denaturation, and was used as a tool to assess the correct folding and trimerization of gp26.7 In contrast, a gp26 fragment N141 missing domains I and II migrated on SDS-PAGE as a monomeric  10 kDa species, irrespective of the temperature at which the assay was performed (Figure 1(b), lanes 11 and 12). Likewise, in solution, on a Superose 6 gel-filtration chromatography column, gp26 deletion constructs containing domain II (N27, C33, and C93) retained the oligomeric quaternary structure seen for wild-type gp26,7 while the smaller N-terminally deleted fragment N141 migrated as a monomer of  10 kDa (Figure 1(c)). Taken together, these data support the idea that gp26 -helical coiled-coil domain II is essential for attaining a stable trimeric structure, which is resistant to SDS at room temperature and removal of domain II results in loss of trimerization. To ensure that deletions in domains I, II and IV did not alter the quaternary structure of domain II, gp26 deletion mutants that retain a trimeric quaternary structure were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Figure 2(a)). The far-UV CD spectrum of full-length gp26 was measured between 197 nm and 260 nm, and the secondary structure content of the native tail needle was estimated from the measured ellipticity using the K2d method.18 This quantification indicated  55% -helical content and

genes 4, 10 or 26 package DNA efficiently, but lose it immediately, displaying a characteristic DNA leakage phenotype characterized by the loss of DNA within minutes, even inside the infected cell.9,10 In addition to serving as DNA stabilization factors, tail accessory factors gp4, gp10 and gp26 have an important role in cell-wall penetration. gp4, the first factor to be incorporated into the phage tail,9 was recently reported to have murein hydrolase activity.11 This activity may allow the virus to digest the host peptidoglycan that forms a thin layer between the outer and inner cell wall lipid bilayers in Gramnegative bacteria like Salmonella. The second tail accessory factor, gp10, binds gp4 to form a structural scaffold for the attachment of tail spike gp9 and tail needle gp26.1,12 The latter protein, gp26, was recently identified as the tail needle protruding from the center of the P22 tail. In the cryo-EM reconstruction of the mature P22 virion,1 as well as in the reconstruction of the isolated phage P22 tail,3 gp26 is visible as an elongated tube of density emanating from gp10. In vitro, ectopically expressed gp26 assembles into a triple-stranded -helical coiled-coil protein, which forms a 220 Å thin fiber as shown by negative stain electron microscopy.7 The location and elongated topology of gp26 suggests that in addition to its function as a molecular plug,9 gp26 may have an important role in penetrating the Salmonella cellwall. Corroborating this idea is the observation that the tail needle gp26 is one of the four P22-encoded proteins ejected into the host during infection, and hence referred to as E-proteins.13 Here, we have studied the domain organization of the tail needle gp26, and defined the polarity of gp26 assembly into the portal vertex structure. Our data indicate that the gp26 N-terminal residues 1­27 form a functional domain that contains the main binding determinant directing attachment to gp10. Domain II of gp26, immediately downstream of domain I, encompasses residues 28­140, and folds into a highly stable and self-assembling -helical core, which is the primary structural determinant for gp26 trimeric quaternary structure. This domain is followed by a less stable and more dynamic C terminus (domains III­IV), which may be involved in puncturing the Salmonella lipid bilayer during penetration of the cell wall.

Results
Domain organization of tail needle gp26 The phage P22 gene 26 encodes a 233 amino acid residue protein (24.7 kDa) that was recently reported to form a triple-stranded coiled-coil rod-like structure  220 Å in length.7 As a first approach to characterize the structural organization of tail needle gp26 and determine how its structure correlates with the postulated role in portal protein closure and cell wall penetration, we undertook a biochemical study of the gp26 domain organization. Secondary structure prediction using the program PHD14,15 sug-

376 roughly equal amount ( 20­22%) of -sheets and random coil conformations. Notably, a gp26 construct lacking domain I, N27, displayed a far-UV CD spectrum identical with that of full-length gp26 (Figure 2(a)), confirming the prediction that residues 1­27 adopt a random coil conformation. Likewise, CD spectra for gp26 C-terminal mutants lacking domains IV (C33) and III-IV (C93) were characterized by strong minima at 208 nm and 222 nm (Figure 2(a)), comparable to those seen for the fulllength protein. Furthermore, while the estimated sheet content for C33 was identical with that of full-length gp26 ( 22%), CD spectra for C93 indicated negligible presence of -sheets ( 1%). This agrees well with the prediction that domain III is highly enriched in -sheets and domain IV is largely -helical. Domain II confers a high level of structural stability to tail needle gp26 We next investigated the structural stability of the individual sub-domains of gp26 to determine how sub-domains of the protein affect the overall stability of the trimer. First, we recorded guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced and temperatureinduced equilibrium unfolding curves for the wildtype gp26. As shown in Figure 2(b) and (c), both unfolding curves displayed a small linear decrease in negative ellipticity up to  5.5 M or  78 °C, followed by a steep cooperative unfolding transition. The half denaturant concentration and melting temperature deduced from the curves were 6.4 M and 85 °C, respectively (Table 1). These data suggest that gp26 unfolding takes place via a highly cooperative two-state transition, from fully folded trimer to unfolded monomers. The denaturation assay was repeated in the concentration range 1­ 200 M, yielding identical denaturation curves (data not shown). Likewise, on SDS-PAGE, gp26 was always found to be trimeric in a range of concentration between micromolar and sub-nanomolar.7 The reversibility of denaturant and thermal-induced unfolding was probed by step-wise reduction in denaturant and slow cooling of the sample, which, in both cases, resulted in a negligible gain in ellipticity. All refolding attempts led to severe

aggregation of gp26 in cuvette, suggesting that the gp26-unfolding transition is strictly irreversible. In light of the apparent concentration-independent trimerization and the highly cooperative denaturation profile, we approximated gp26 unfolding to a two state reaction where only two species are populated at equilibrium; namely, folded trimer and unfolded gp26 monomer. Global fit analysis of the GdnHCl-induced denaturation curve yielded an apparent free energy of unfolding of G 0 (H2O) = 18.6( ± 0.9) kcal/mol with a corresponding apparent unfolding/dissociation constant Ku = 4.42 × 10- 13 M. The free energy of unfolding is significantly higher than those typically observed for monomeric proteins,19 but in agreement with highly stable trimeric proteins such as the foldon domain of phage T4 fibritin (21.3 kcal/mol). 20 Likewise, the apparent sub-picomolar unfolding/dissociation constant strengthens the idea that in solution gp26 always exists as a trimer. In a parallel set of experiments, we investigated the GdnHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding of gp26 deletion constructs lacking domains I, IV or III and IV. As expected, unfolding curves for N27 were identical with those of full-length gp26 (Figure 2(b)), confirming the prediction that this domain does not affect the overall stability of gp26. In contrast, GdnHCl-induced denaturation for gp26 fragments lacking domain IV (C33), and lacking domains III and IV (C93) differed both qualitatively and quantitatively from those of full-length gp26 and N27. C33 unfolding was characterized by a steep transition between 5 M and 5.6 M with a half denaturant concentration of  5.3 M, which is approximately 1.1 M lower than that of full-length gp26. An even greater loss of structural stability was observed for C93, which lacks both domains III and IV. For this construct, the unfolding curve displayed less pronounced steepness as compared to that of full-length gp26 and C33, and a half denaturant concentration of 4.7 M (Figure 2(b)). To rule out the possibility that the loss of stability of gp26 fragments lacking domains III and IV was caused by an increased sensitivity to high ionic strength at high concentrations of GdnHCl, we investigated the thermal unfolding of gp26 deletion constructs at physiological ionic strength in phosphate-buffered

The five trimerization octad repeats (OR) have been mapped on the structure of the tail needle. OR1­OR4 are located in domain II, OR5 is in domain IV. All N and C-terminal deletion constructs used in this study are shown below wild-type gp26. (b) SDS-PAGE analysis of purified gp26 deletion constructs. All gp26 samples were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer17 containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Before loading, samples were either boiled for 5 min at 95 °C or incubated for 5 min at room temperature (22 °C). As shown in (b), gp26 deletion fragments containing domain II separated as trimers when unboiled (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 13). The trimeric migration on SDS-PAGE indicates resistance to SDS at room temperature (22 °C). Only the fragment N141, which encompasses residues 141­233 and lacks domains I and II, migrated on SDS-PAGE as a monomeric species of  10 kDa, irrespective of the temperature (lanes 11 and 12). (c) Oligomeric state of gp26 constructs used in this study. Purified full-length gp26 and the fragments shown in (a) were analyzed on a Superose 6 gel-filtration chromatography. The column was calibrated using high molecular mass markers, whose elution volume is indicated by arrows. As previously reported,7 wild-type gp26 migration on gelfiltration chromatography is biased by the elongated shape of this molecule, and results in an apparent mass 250 kDa. All N and C-terminally deleted fragment utilized in this study except N141, migrated as larger species with an apparent mass between 250 kDa and 120 kDa.

378 Domain II retains a folded trimeric structure in an anhydrous environment and 10% SDS To further characterize domain II-mediated trimerization, we analyzed the stability of full-length gp26 and C93 in an anhydrous environment. Purified wild-type gp26 and C93 were concentrated to complete dryness using the Speed Vac system and subsequently rehydrated by adding distilled water. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, where rehydrated gp26 and C93 (indicated as + Dry in Figure 3) migrated as trimers at room temperature (Figure 3, lanes 1 and 7) and monomers after boiling (Figure 3, lanes 4 and 8). In light of the irreversible denaturation of gp26 described above, these data support the idea that gp26 retains a trimeric conformation in an anhydrous environment, and deprivation of water does not affect SDS-resistance in a polyacrylamide gel. As the hydrophobic effect is severely reduced in the absence of water,21 the observation that gp26 retains a trimeric quaternary structure in an anhydrous environment suggests that, in addition to hydrophobic interactions, molecular interactions such as electrostatic or van der Waals interactions may play a significant role in the high stability of the trimer. To further test this idea, the quaternary structure of gp26 was probed by increasing the SDS concentration in the Laemmli sample buffer from 0.1% to 10%. As shown in Figure 3, both wild-type gp26 and C93 retained a trimeric migration even in 10% SDS (Figure 3, lanes 13 and 18). A slight increase in the apparent size of full-length gp26 and C93 was observed at higher concentrations of SDS, which likely reflects the binding of more SDS equivalents to the trimeric needle, with a consequent formation of slower migration species. The inability of 10% SDS to disrupt the gp26 hydrophobic core together with the stability of the trimer in an anhydrous environment further illustrate the unprecedented stability of the domain II-mediated trimerization interface.

Domain I is the main determinant for gp26 assembly into the portal vertex structure After defining the overall domain organization of the phage P22 tail needle gp26, we were interested in determining the polarity of this protein fiber in the portal vertex structure. In the low-resolution structure of the phage P22 tail machine extracted from mature phage,3 as well as the reconstruction of the mature virion,1 gp26 appears as an elongated needle of density, characterized by two molecular tips,

(a) The far-UV CD spectra of wild-type gp26 and gp26 fragments containing domain II were measured between 197 nm and 260 nm. All spectra were recorded in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8), 170 mM NaCl at 20 °C. (b) and (c) Stability of wild-type gp26 and gp26 fragments containing domain II against GdnHCl and thermal denaturation. Unfolding curves were recorded by measuring changes in the ellipticity intensity at 222 nm, which is indicative of -helical content. The protein concentrations used in this experiment were 5.25­ 7.25 M. Identical unfolding curves were obtained by repeating both GdnHCl-and thermal denaturation assays in a concentration range between 1­200 M (data not shown), suggesting that domain II-mediated trimerization of gp26 is concentration-independent. All unfolding curves in (b) and (c) were found to be irreversible. Attempts to refold gp26 typically resulted in severe precipitation and visible aggregation of gp26 in the cuvette.

379 gp26 to bead-bound dodecameric gp1 (Figure 4(b), lane 5).12 The sequential addition of gp4, gp10, and gp26 is essential for the correct assembly of the P22 portal vertex structure, which fails if the purified components gp1, gp4, gp10, and gp26 are simply mixed together.12 To define the polarity of gp26 in the tail, we repeated the on-bead tail assembly assay using purified fragments of gp26 lacking either Cterminal domains III and IV (C93) or the Nterminal domain I (N27). Interestingly, we found that C-terminal deletion of domains III and IV did not affect incorporation of C93-gp26 into the tail (Figure 4(b), lanes 6 and 7). In contrast, removal of domain I (residues 1­27) resulted in a dramatic loss of gp26 incorporation (Figure 4(b), lanes 8 and 9). To further confirm these data, we generated an Nterminal deletion fragment of gp26 that lacks the entire domain I plus 23 residues of domain II. This construct (N50), which retained trimerization on SDS-PAGE (Figure 1(b), lane 10), failed to be incorporated into the tail in our in vitro tail assembly assay (Figure 4(b), lane 11). Taken together, these findings suggest the N-terminal region of gp26 is necessary for binding to gp10. Given the elongated rod-like structure of the tail needle, if the gp26 tip proximal to the portal protein contains the N terminus of the tail needle, the C-terminal tip is likely to be exposed to solvent and to be involved in cell wall penetration. Destabilization of gp26 octads OR4 and OR5 has a more dramatic effect on the overall stability of the tail needle We next attempted to understand how specific trimerization motifs in gp26 affect the assembly and

spaced-apart  200 Å from each other. The gp26 tip proximal to the portal protein interacts with tail accessory factor gp10 to function as a portal closure factor.9 In contrast, the gp26 tip distal from portal protein is exposed to the solvent and may be involved in penetrating the host cell wall. To determine the polarity of gp26 within the portal vertex structure, and thus assess the functional role of the previously defined sub-domains of gp26, we utilized an in vitro assembly assay on Sepharose beads (Figure 4(a)). In this assay, dodecameric P22 portal protein was covalently coupled to Sepharose beads (beads-gp1, Figure 4(b), lane 1), and the portal vertex structure was assembled in vitro by sequentially adding purified tail factors gp4, gp10, and gp26 to gp1-beads (Figure 4(b), lanes 2­5). This sequential assembly reaction results in the attachment of 12 copies of gp4, one hexamer of gp10 and a trimer of

Figure 3. Stability of gp26 in an anhydrous environment and at high concentrations of detergent. Full-length gp26 and the C-terminal fragment C93 were dehydrated overnight using a Speed Vac system. Powdered proteins were resuspended in distilled water and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. As shown in lanes 3 and 7, after dehydration (+Dry) both fulllength gp26 and C93 formed trimers on SDS-PAGE indistinguishable from those seen using gp26 without dehydration (­Dry), in lanes 1 and 5. Likewise, gp26 and C93 treated with increasing concentration of SDS (0.1­10%, w/v) migrates on SDS-PAGE as trimers. At higher concentrations of SDS (lanes 10­13 and 15­18), the electrophoretic mobility of both full-length gp26 and C93 was slightly reduced, resulting in a slower migration on the polyacrylamide gel. This effect is likely caused by the binding of additional equivalents of detergent to the gp26 trimers.

(a) A diagram of the in vitro assay used to determine gp26 polarity in the tail. Dodecameric gp1 is covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia), and purified tail accessory factors gp4, gp10, and gp26 are sequentially added to gp1 beads to build the virus tail. To define the polarity of gp26 assembly, wild-type gp26 was replaced by either N27, which lacks the N-terminal domain I, or by C93, which lacks both C-terminal domains III and IV. (b) SDS-PAGE analysis of the on-bead tail assembly assay. The input gp1-beads are in lane 1. Sequential addition of purified gp4 and gp10 yielded a heterotrimeric gp1:gp4:gp10 complex (lane 3). Purified wild-type gp26 control (lane 4) assembled onto this complex efficiently to form a portal vertex structure (lane 5). Efficient assembly was seen also using C93. The control showing purified C93 is in lane 6, while the assembled gp1: gp4: gp10: C93gp26 tail is in lane 7. Addition of N27 (lane 8) to a bead-bound gp1: gp4:gp10 complex resulted in less than 5% incorporation of this mutant into the tail (lane 9). Binding to gp10 was abolished completely using N50 (lane 10), which lacks domain I and the first 23 residues of domain II (lane 11).

stability of the tail needle. gp26 contains five trimerization repeats, four in domain II and one in domain IV (Figure 5(a)). An interesting feature of these motifs lies in the nearly perfect conservation of amino acids at position a/d, which is always Iso/ Leu in domain II and Ile/Ile in domain IV. 7 Likewise, all five trimerization motifs present a conserved hydrophobic residue at position 8 (h), which in three cases is valine. This pattern of conservation renders gp26 trimerization motifs an octad rather than a conventional heptad. 22 To determine the contribution of individual octad repeats (OR) on the stability and trimerization of the tail needle, we performed systematic alanine mutagenesis analysis of residues at position a/d. Alanine is compatible with helical folding but is expected to severely reduce hydrophobic interactions among gp26 protomers. Double mutants of gp26 bearing alanine substitutions at positions a/d were named OR1(I77A­L80A), OR2(I98A­L101A), OR3(I112A­L115A), OR4(I133A­L136A), and OR5 (I205A­I208A), respectively (Figure 5(a)). All gp26 mutants were over-expressed in E. coli and purified from soluble extracts. On SDS-PAGE, unboiled a/d

mutants displayed the characteristic SDS-resistance pattern seen for wild-type gp26 (data not shown), suggesting the a/d mutations did not disrupt the trimerization interface.7 To assess the effect of a/d mutations on the overall structural stability of gp26, we investigated the thermal stability of these mutants as compared to wild-type gp26. Notably, a/d mutations in OR1 showed a marginal effect on gp26 stability, which resulted in a qualitatively similar denaturation profile and loss of 3 °C on the apparent temperature of melting (Tm  82 °C versus 85 °C, see Table 1). Interestingly, mutations at a/d positions in the other trimerization octads had a distinct effect on the stability of gp26 (Figure 5(b)). Mutations at OR2 and OR3 resulted in steep monophasic and highly cooperative unfolding transitions with apparent Tm of 71 °C and 74 °C, respectively (Table 1). Despite the significant destabilization of these two mutants, evidenced by a loss of  10­14 °C on the Tm (Table 1), the slope of the unfolding transitions remained very similar to that of wild-type gp26 (Figure 5(b)). This suggests a/d mutations at OR2 and OR3 destabilized the quaternary structure of the tail needle, without altering

381 the local environment of Trp176 becomes solventexposed. By monitoring the variations in intrinsic fluorescence emission of Trp176 occurring during chemical unfolding, we were able to detect specific changes in the quaternary structure of gp26 bearing mutations at position a/d of the five trimerization octads. This information was compared to that provided by far-UV CD spectroscopy, which primarily monitors changes in the secondary structure.19 As a positive control for this comparison, the unfolding transitions of wild-type gp26 (Figure 7(a)) revealed similar shapes by CD and fluorescence, and nearly consistent Tm and half denaturant concentration (Table 1). Different scenarios were observed for the five a/d mutants. Mutants OR1(I77A­L80A), OR2 (I98A­L101A) and OR3(I112A­L115A) displayed steep monophasic and highly cooperative unfolding transitions (Figure 7(b)­(d)), characterized by half denaturant concentrations of the order of  5.5 M,  4.1 M,  5.1 M, respectively (Table 1). In all three cases, a/d mutations in OR1, OR2, and OR3 marginally destabilized the structure of the tail fiber without changing the nature of the unfolding transition, and altering the oligomeric state of gp26, which remained trimeric on 12.5% SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Although there was a general agreement between fluorescence and CD-monitored unfolding, mutations in OR1 appeared to decrease the overall stability of gp26 more severely when measured by fluorescence as compared to CD (5.5 M versus 4.7 M) (Figure 7(b)). In contrast, mutants OR4(I133A­ L136A), and OR5(I205A­I208A), which carry muta-

Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to replace hydrophobic residues at position a/d for all five trimerization motifs. (b) Stability of the gp26 a/d mutants toward thermal-induced denaturation was recorded by measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm.

the unfolding pathway of the trimer, which "collapses" irreversibly in a narrow range of temperature. In contrast, mutations at OR4 and OR5, which flank the -sheet-rich domain III, displayed a less steep and multiphasic unfolding transition (Figure 5 (b)), characterized by a Tm 5­10 °C lower than that of OR2(I98A­L101A). These data reveal an intriguing positional effect of mutations at position a/d; destabilization of octads OR4 and OR5, which flank domain III, had a greater effect on gp26 stability and unfolding pathway than mutations at OR1, OR2, or OR3. Tryptophan 176 as a specific probe to monitor the unfolding of domains III and IV Trp176, the only tryptophan in the gp26 primary structure (Figure 6(a)), is in the -sheet-rich domain III (residues 141­200). The fluorescence emission spectrum of full-length gp26 has a maximum near 328 nm, as expected from a tryptophan residue that is largely buried (Figure 6(b)). Titration of gp26 with increasing concentrations of GdnHCl resulted in a significant red shift in the fluorescence emission maximum wavelength towards 356 nm, suggesting

(b) GdnHClinduced unfolding of gp26 resulted in a significant redshift of Trp176 emission maximum wavelength from 328 nm to 356 nm, suggesting the indole ring becomes more exposed to solvent.

Figure 7. Comparative analysis of wild-type and gp26 a/d mutant stability toward GdnHCl-induced denaturation. Unfolding curves were recorded by measuring either the ellipticity change at 222 nm (left-hand Y axis) or the Trp176 fluorescence emission maximum at excitation wavelength of 295 nm (right-hand Y axis). The positive control, wild-type gp26, is in (a), and unfolding curves for a/d mutants are shown in (b)­(f). Mutations at OR4 and OR5 ((e) and (f)) destabilized gp26 unfolding more dramatically when monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy than circular dichroism.

tions flanking the -sheet-rich domain III (residues 141­200), revealed drastically different unfolding transitions by fluorescence spectroscopy as compared to CD. By CD, both OR4 and OR5 mutants yielded characteristic biphasic-unfolding curves (Figure 7(e) and (f)), characterized by the presence of two putative unfolding events. The first event takes place at denaturant concentration between 2 M and 4.5 M and likely reflects the unfolding of domains III and IV. The second part of the unfolding curve, at a concentration of GdnHCl higher than

4.5 M was interpreted as the highly cooperative unfolding of domain II, which qualitatively resembles the unfolding profile seen for gp26 mutants at OR1, OR2 and OR3 (Figure 7(b)­(d), Table 1). The half GdnHCl concentrations observed for OR4 and OR5 mutants also agree well with that of C93, which lacks domains III and IV (Figure 2(b), Table 1). In contrast, when the denaturation of OR4 and OR5 was monitored by following the fluorescence of the Trp176, monophasic unfolding curves were observed at a significantly lower concentration of

383 organization of gp26 and to determine the structural determinants for its stability. Our data indicate that, consistent with its function as a molecular plug9 and cell wall penetrating needle,3,1 gp26 is characterized by an extraordinarily high structural stability. The trimer is resistant to 10% SDS at room temperature, and retains a trimeric quaternary structure in an anhydrous environment. Heat-induced and GdnHCl-induced denaturation of gp26 is irreversible with an apparent Tm and half denaturant concentration of  85 °C7 and 6.6 M GdnHCl, respectively. Using mutational analysis, we showed that gp26 contains at least four structural subdomains and five trimerization octad repeats. These motifs represent an extension of the classical trimerization heptads found in class I membrane fusion proteins,23 in that a hydrophobic residue is conserved at positions h. Four octads are found in domain II with consensus Ile-xx-Leu-xxx-Val/Tyr, while one more degenerated octad is in the Cterminal domain IV (Ile-xx-Ile-xxx-Leu). Although the five-trimerization octads intuitively generate an extended hydrophobic interface, purified gp26 retains a stable trimeric quaternary structure in an anhydrous environment, where hydrophobic interactions are greatly reduced. This suggests the overall quaternary structure of the tail needle is stabilized by

GdnHCl as compared to CD. The apparent half denaturant concentration measured for OR4 (I133A­ L136A) and OR5(I205A­I208A) were 2.0 M, and overlapped well with the first transition seen in the biphasic curves measured by CD (Figure 7(e) and (f)). In summary, these data suggest that mutations in OR4 and OR5 drastically destabilize the chemical environment surrounding Trp176, which becomes exposed to the solvent even at low concentrations of GdnHCl ( 2 M), while the helical core domain II remains stably folded.

Discussion
Tail needle gp26 is a highly stable fibrous needle Tail accessory factor gp26 was recently reported to form an elongated triple-stranded coiled-coil fibrous needle of  220 Å in length.3,7 In the cryo-EM reconstruction of the P22 tail extracted from mature virus,3 as well as in the asymmetric reconstruction of the P22 mature virion,1 gp26 is visible as a thin needle of density, which protrudes from the center of the portal protein channel, where gp10 is bound (Figure 8(a)). In this study, we have used biochemical and biophysical methods to outline the basic domain

Figure 8. Proposed topology and structural organization of tail needle gp26 in the context of phage P22 tail. (a) The cryo-EM structure of phage P22 tail extracted from mature virus (accession code EMD-1119)3 was displayed using the program Chimera.32 The tail needle projects 220 Å from the center of tail, where gp10 extends the gp1:gp4 DNApumping channel.3 (b) The polarity of gp26 elucidated in this paper defines the N terminus of the needle as the main structural determinant for assembly to gp10. The N-terminal domain I is bound to (or inside) the gp10 channel, and proximal to the portal protein. Domain II protrudes away from the neck of the tail and extends into a more dynamic C terminus (domains III­IV), which is distal from the portal protein and likely solvent-exposed. Consistent with its more dynamic nature, we propose this region of the tail needle acts as a membrane-puncturing device that destabilizes the Salmonella cell-wall lipid bilayers while domain I plugs the portal protein channel.

384 more than just octad-mediated hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic and van der Waals forces among the three gp26 protomers must also play a significant role. Domain I forms a functional unit necessary for assembly to gp10 The N-terminal region of gp26 between residues 1 and 27 forms a functional domain, which is not required for gp26 self-assembly or for its structural stability. This is supported by two observations. First, the N-terminal deletion construct lacking domain I (N27) folds efficiently in E. coli, and remains trimeric on gel filtration chromatography and on SDS-PAGE. Second, the deletion construct N27 has a level of stability identical with that of wild-type gp26, indicating that domain I does not affect the overall stability of gp26. Using the on-bead tail assembly assay reported recently by Olia et al.,12 we determined that domain I of gp26 is required for efficient binding to gp10, which leads to portal protein closure. Removal of domain I (mutant N27) greatly disrupts gp26 assembly to gp10. Further removal of the first 23 amino acid residues of domain II (mutant N50) completely abolishes the interaction of gp26 with the tail apparatus. These data point out an intriguing role of domain I as a functional unit, which is not required for gp26 trimerization, and does not affect the overall structural stability of the tail needle when removed, but engages in the critical function of binding with gp10, and possibly portal protein closure.9 We speculate that the N-terminal moiety of gp26 (residues 1­27) undergoes a conformational change upon assembly into the portal vertex structure and becomes tightly bound to the rest of the tail. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that prolonged heating of the mature P22 virion at 60 °C in the presence of 2 M urea and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X100 results in detachment of intact gp26-bound tails from the capsid, but does not extract the tail needle from the rest of the tail.3 Domain II represents the main self-assembling, highly stable trimerization core of gp26 The predicted -helical coiled-coil domain spanning residues 28­140, domain II, is the main structural determinant for trimerization and stability of the tail needle. Domain II is followed by a C-terminal domain III enriched in -sheets (residues 141­200) and the -helical domain IV (residues 201­233). Our deletion data indicate that the gp26 helical core, domain II, self-assembles in E. coli in the absence of the flanking domain I, and domains III and IV. This is supported by the evidence that both N and C-terminally deleted fragments N27 and C93 lacking domain I, and domains III and IV, respectively, fold properly in E. coli, are expressed with yield identical with that of wild-type gp26, and form SDS-resistant trimers. As a corollary, we conclude that both in vivo and in vitro, domain II of gp26

Structural Organization of Tail Needle gp26

contains all structural determinants necessary for efficient self-assembly and correct trimerization. What holds the three gp26 protomers together in domain II? As previously pointed out, domain II contains four trimerization octads, namely OR1, OR2, OR3, and OR4. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues at position a/d of these octads was used to weaken the hydrophobic interactions holding gp26 protomers together. However, in none of the four a/d double mutants tested in this study, did replacing residues at positions a/d with alanine abolish trimerization and/or SDS-resistance, indicating that individual octads are not essential for gp26 trimerization, at least when disrupted individually. In addition, the gp26 helical core could be lyophilized, and retained its folded conformation when fully dehydrated. Given the irreversible denaturation profile seen in the heat-induced and GdnHCl-induced unfolding experiments, it is intuitive that lyophilization does not induce denaturation of gp26 strands followed by refolding in the presence of water. More likely, gp26 retains a trimeric quaternary structure in the absence of water. This reinforces the idea that in addition to octad-mediated hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, which are typically stronger in the absence of water,21 must also play an important role in the trimerization of domain II. How does domain II self-assemble in E. coli? It is well documented that during the oligomerization of rod-like proteins containing repetitive sequences such as heptads (or octads), it is possible to obtain mismatched structures, which lead to intra-cellular aggregation.24,25 This problem can be partially resolved by the action of downstream domains that act as "registration" motifs,26 to ensure that correct oligomerization begins at a defined nucleation point. For instance, in the case of fibritin,27 a 530 Å long triple-stranded coiled-coil protein fiber forming the whisker of phage T4, a 27 amino acid residue Cterminal domain termed foldon is essential for correct nucleation and trimerization. C-terminal deletion constructs of fibritin lacking the foldon fail to fold correctly, resulting in misfolded structures.28 The folding landscape for the gp26 helical core domain II and its structural interplay with the downstream -sheet-rich domain III are somewhat different from those of phage T4 fibritin. This is true at least at two levels: first, a deletion mutant of gp26 lacking domains III and IV (C93) self-assembles properly in E. coli, indicating that domain II represents a self-assembling helical unit. Second, while the foldon is per se a trimer in solution,28,29 a fragment of gp26 containing C-terminal domains III and IV fails to trimerize in solution and on SDSPAGE. This suggests the C-terminal domains III and IV of gp26 do not represent a foldon-like molecular cap, and trimerization of the tail needle is not likely to initiate from the C terminus of the molecule. Intriguingly, although not required for correct trimerization, gp26 C-terminal domains III and IV synergize with domain II to enhance its structural stability by 10 deg.C.

A putative role for gp26 C-terminal domains III and IV What is the function of the gp26 C-terminal domains III and IV? In the cryo-EM reconstruction of the P22 tail, gp26 forms a long needle, characterized by two tips, described as distal and proximal to portal protein (Figure 8(a)). In this study, we have demonstrated that the N terminus of gp26 (residues 1­27) forms the proximal tip of the needle that assembles to gp10. In turn, domain II (residues 28­140) folds into a -helical coiled-coil structure emanating from gp10. In light of the rod-like topology of gp26, domains III and IV are likely to form the gp26 tip distal from the portal protein, facing outwards from the P22 virion (Figure 8(a) and (b)). Our mutational analysis supports the idea that two structurally distinct and functionally specialized moieties exist within the tail needle. Whereas domain I is necessary for gp10 binding and is adjacent to domain II, which forms a stable, self-assembling rigid "stick", the Cterminal tip of the protein (domains III and IV) appears to be more dynamic and flexible. This is corroborated by two observations: first, removal of domains I and II (N141) results in loss of trimerization, as assessed by gel-filtration chromatography and SDS-PAGE. Second, point mutations in octads OR4 and OR5 severely perturb the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp176, resulting in the formation of putative folding intermediates, which are visible by fluorescence spectroscopy at low concentration of denaturant (2 M). Unfolding curves for OR4 and OR5 mutants display monophasic nature when monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy, whereas a biphasic transition is seen by CD. We postulate the ellipticity of unfolding at 222 nm reflects closely the destabilization of the -helix-rich domain II secondary structure, while Trp176 detects primarily the destabilization of C-terminal domains III and IV. This implies that mutations in OR4 and OR5 destabilize more dramatically domains III and IV, which start unfolding at low concentrations of GdnHCl even when the helical core domain II is still folded. The ability of a large portion of gp26 to unfold, while the main trimerization core of the protein remains trimeric is consistent with a potential role of the gp26 C-terminal tip in puncturing the outer lipid bilayer of the Salmonella cell wall. Similar to viral membrane fusion proteins that destabilize the lipid bilayer to promote membrane fusion,23 we hypothesize that the gp26 C-terminal domains III and IV function as a lipid-puncturing needle by engaging in extensive interactions with phospholipids, while the gp26 main helical core domain II is folded and domain I closes the portal vertex structure.23 In conclusion, our biochemical and biophysical analyses define the tail needle gp26 as a bi-functional protein fiber; while the N-terminal tip of the protein plugs the portal protein channel, the C-terminal tip may bear the lipid-puncturing activity necessary to penetrate the host cell wall (Figure 8(b)). Further studies are required to test directly the interaction of gp26 Cterminal domains III and IV with lipid bilayers.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and DNA constructs All gp26 mutants used in this study were derived from a pET15b-gp26 plasmid that encodes gp26 fused to an N-terminal His6 tag.7 N-terminal deletion constructs N27 (residues 28­233), N50 (residues 51­233), and N141 (residues 142­233) were amplified by PCR and ligated into NdeI-BamHI restriction sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen), C-terminal deletion constructs C33 (residues 1­200) and C93 (residues 1­140) were constructed by introducing an amber stop codon (TAG) at positions 201 and 141 of pET15b-gp26, using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The gp26 double mutants at position a/d of each OR were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). All constructs generated in this study were sequenced entirely to ensure the correctness of the DNA sequence. Expression and purification of recombinant proteins Recombinant wild-type gp26 7 and various gp26 mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21-DE3. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 mg/l of ampicillin and 2.5 g/l of glucose. When the cell density reached an A600 of 0.6, the culture was induced for 16 h at 22 °C with 0.5 mM isopropyl 1-thio-, Dgalactopyranoside. Cells derived from the culture were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM -mercaptoethanol, plus protease inhibitors). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min to remove cell debris. All target proteins were isolated from the supernatant by metal-chelating affinity chromatography using Qiagen Nickel-NTA beads. Typically, 1 l of E. coli yielded about 5 mg of pure protein, which was concentrated using an Amicon ultracentrifugal filter device (Millipore) with a 10,000 Da cutoff. The concentrated proteins were applied to a Superose 6 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated in gel filtration buffer (20 mm Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM -mercaptoethanol). Calibration of the gel-filtration column was carried out using globular protein standards (GE, Healthcare) ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and ribonuclease (13 kDa). Elution fractions were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE confirming a purity of N 90%. Expression and purification of P22 portal protein gp1, and tail accessory factors gp4 and gp10 was carried out as described.6 The concentration of all recombinant proteins used in this study was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using theoretical absorption coefficients calculated from the protein primary sequence. Dehydration assay To analyze the stability of gp26 in an anhydrous environment, 20 l of wild-type gp26 or C93 (1­140) at  1 mg/ml were evaporated to dryness at 42 °C for 12 h using a Speed Vac concentrator system (Savant). Dehydrated gp26 samples were dissolved in 20 l of distilled water and Laemmli buffer was added. Samples were incubated either at room temperature (22 °C) or at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by electrophoretic separation on 12.5% SDS-PAGE.

Spectroscopic techniques Circular dichroism (CD) spectra in the far-UV region were recorded using an AVIV 62A DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab CFT-33 refrigerated recirculator. Fluorescence data were collected on a Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a thermally controlled cell holder and 0.5 cm path-length cuvette. All spectroscopic measurements were done with a final protein concentration of 0.15 mg/ml (equivalent to  5.25­7.25 M, depending on the construct) in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 170 mm NaCl. CD spectra were recorded between 197 nm and 260 nm in rectangular quartz cuvettes with a pathlength of 0.1 cm. Low-noise CD spectra were obtained by averaging three scans. Secondary structure contents were calculated by the K2d method available on the DichroWeb Server.18 Temperatureinduced unfolding curves were monitored using a 0.1 cm path-length cuvette by recording variations in ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature in 1 deg. C increments. After each increment, samples were equilibrated for 60 s and CD spectra recorded with an integration time of 15 s. Denaturant equilibrium unfolding For equilibrium unfolding studies, solutions of gp26 or mutant proteins were mixed stepwise with increasing amounts of buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 170 mm NaCl) containing 8 M GdnHCl to a final protein concentration of 0.15 mg/ml (equivalent to  5.25­ 7.25 M depending on the construct). The molar concentration of the GdnHCl stock solution was verified using refractive index measurements. Solutions were allowed to equilibrate at 25 °C overnight. For CD experiments, the starting solution without GdnHCl was placed into a 0.1 cm path-length cuvette thermostatically controlled at 25 °C, and the concentration of GdnHCl was changed incrementally by removing an aliquot from the cell and replacing it with an equal volume of protein solution. Solutions were allowed to equilibrate until no change in signal was observed, and then the ellipticity at 222 nm was averaged for 60 s and recorded. GdnHCl denaturation data for wild-type gp26 fit well to a two-state transition, assuming a monomer unfolding model,30,31 where the two states correspond to folded native (N) and denatured (D) monomeric gp26, respectively. The free energy of unfolding (Gu) was obtained by fitting GdnHCl denaturation data with a non-linear curve-fitting function using the software ORIGIN 6.0. For experiments using intrinsic fluorescence, the solutions were prepared as described above and transferred to a 0.5 cm path-length cuvette thermostatically controlled at 25 °C, and allowed to equilibrate until no change in fluorescence was observed. GdnHCl-induced denaturation was followed by measuring the changes in the gp26 intrinsic fluorescence emission between 300 nm and 450 nm in the presence of 0.0­8.0 M GdnHCl, using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a bandwidth of 3 nm for both excitation and emission. The intensity of the Raman peak of water was used as an internal standard. In vitro tail assembly assay on Sepharose beads The on-bead tail assembly used to determine gp26 polarity was carried out as described.12 Briefly, beads were prepared by covalently coupling 10 mg of recombinant dodecameric portal protein gp1 to 1 ml of CNBr-activated

Structural Organization of Tail Needle gp26 Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia). Then 100 g (50 l of 2 mg/ml) of gp4 was added to 25 l of gp1-beads and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The gp4:gp1beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and then incubated with 100 g (50 l of 2 mg/ml) of gp10. After washing away unbound gp10, the beads were incubated with either wild-type gp26 or deletion mutants. After three washes with PBS, the beads were boiled in 25 l of SDS sample buffer to elute bound proteins, and samples were subsequently analyzed on SDS-PAGE (12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel) followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue.
