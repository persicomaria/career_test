Abstract The mechanism and energetics of the purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma vivax (TvNH) are examined by stopped-flow at low temperatures. TvNH is shown to follow an ordered uni­bi kinetic mechanism and high forward commitment with inosine as substrate (Cf = 1.9 ± 0.6). Measurement of partitioning of the Michaelis complex, which exists at negligible concentrations in the steady state, is achieved using a novel sequential-mixing stopped-flow method. A product burst is observed with p-nitrophenyl riboside (pNPR) in the pre-steady state, indicating that a step after chemistry rate determines kcat. Comparison of the kinetics of inosine and pNPR turnover shows that the dominant energetic contribution towards catalysis in TvNH comes from ribosyl and water activation (11 kcal/mol); however, leaving group activation still makes a considerable (8 kcal/mol) contribution. A solvent isotope effect (D2Ok = 1.7) on the chemistry transient 1 with guanosine as substrate was observed. Therefore, the leaving group is unlikely to be protonated prior to N-glycosidic bond cleavage. We propose that leaving group protonation is, by itself, unlikely to account for the large energetic contribution of leaving group activation. Instead, we postulate that active site binding interactions to the purine leaving group are required for efficient ribosyl and/or water activation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Nucleoside hydrolases (NHs) are a family of structurally related enzymes that catalyse the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of nucleosides (Scheme 1) [1]. Although found in most organisms, their physiological role is only well understood in certain parasitic protozoa, such as trypanosomes, where they are involved in purine salvage pathways. Their absence in higher eukaryotes, including mammals, has led to the proposal that NH may be a suitable target for antibiotic development against

trypanosomal diseases. NH has also been proposed for use as pro-drug activators in chemotherapy [2]. NHs are notable for their catalytic power, showing rate enhancements of the order of 1012 with respect to the uncatalysed reaction [3]. Extensive studies by the Schramm laboratory have established three catalytic strategies in the base-aspecific NH from Crithidia fasciculata (CfNH): (i) stabilisation of a ribooxocarbenium ion-like transition state, (ii) activation of substrate water, and (iii) activation of the leaving group [4]. Purine leaving groups are activated for departure by protonation at N-1 or N-7 using the general acid His 241 [5]. By contrast, general acid catalysis does not play a role in leaving group activation in the purine-specific NH from Trypanosoma vivax (TvNH [1]). This is intriguing because leaving group activation is thought to make a greater catalytic contribution in purinespecific NHs. For example, in the purine-specific NH from Trypanosoma brucei brucei (TbbNH), it was estimated that leaving group activation is responsible for  50% of the total catalytic rate enhancement, as opposed to  25% in CfNH [6].

Scheme 1. Reaction catalysed by NH.

Further insight into the mechanism of leaving group activation in TvNH was made possible by the determination of the crystal structure of TvNH with bound substrates and inhibitors [1,7]. These structures show that the leaving group is stacked between two active site tryptophan residues (Trp 83 and Trp 260). Mutagenesis and ab initio computational studies indicate that aromatic stacking can promote protonation by increasing the pKa at N-7 [8]. Protonation is further facilitated by formation of an intramolecular O5-H-C8 hydrogen bond between ribose and the leaving group base [9]. One difficulty with this model is that the observed rate of Nglycosidic bond cleavage is relatively independent of pH between pH 4.5 and 8.0 [10]. If the N-7 protonated [TvNH. substrate] complex is an intermediate on the catalytic pathway, then the rate of chemistry should decrease at pH values above the pKa of the leaving group. One possible explanation for the absence of this effect is that the pKa of the leaving group is increased from 2 to at least 8, some 6 pKa units ( 8 kcal/mol). Alternatively, the measured rate of N-glycosidic bond cleavage may actually be rate determined by a step prior to chemistry (e.g., a conformation change). This is a distinct possibility given that the active site is known to exist in at least two conformation states (termed the open and closed forms) [7]. A second, related issue that needs to be addressed is to determine the energetic contribution of leaving group activation in the TvNH reaction. Estimates of the energetic contribution of leaving group activation in CfNH and TbbNH have been made previously based on steady-state rates with the mechanistic probe substrate p-nitrophenyl riboside (pNPR) [11,6]. The hydrolysis of pNPR cannot be acid catalysed above pH 7 because protonation of both substrate and product p-nitrophenylate become thermodynamically unfavourable [12,13]. The rate enhancement observed with pNPR (enzymatic rate minus the

non-enzymatic rate) is therefore attributed to the capacity of the NH to stabilise the ribosyl moiety as it proceeds through a ribooxocarbenium transition state. However, the complex kinetic mechanism of TvNH makes comparisons of steadystate rates difficult to assess (Scheme 2). While kcat represents the intrinsic rate of chemistry for CfNH [3], kcat for TvNH corresponds to the rate of isomerisation of the [TvNH.ribose] product complex for purine nucleoside substrates [14]. kcat for TvNH with pNPR is smaller than with purine nucleoside substrates, suggesting that it represents a step upstream of the [TvNH.ribose] isomerisation step [15]. Comparisons of kcat/Km are also difficult because the forward commitments (Cf) for purine nucleosides and pNPR are unknown for TvNH (Cf  0 in CfNH). Here we develop kinetic schemes for both inosine and pNPR at 5 °C that allow the relative energetic contributions of ribosyl and leaving group activation to be calculated. We show that product release is ordered for inosine and calculate the forward commitments for both inosine and pNPR. We also examine solvent isotope effects on the transient kinetics of guanosine in order to probe the mechanism of leaving group protonation.
2. Experimental procedures 2.1. General procedures
The concentrations of enzyme, nucleoside and base stock solutions were determined using the following extinction coefficients [16]: TvNH, 280 (47.75 mM- 1 cm- 1, pH 7.0); guanosine, 253 (13.6 mM- 1 cm- 1, pH 6.0); inosine, 248.5 (12.3 mM- 1 cm- 1, pH 6.0); 7-methyl guanosine, 258 (8.5 mM- 1 cm- 1, pH 7.0), 281 (7.4 mM- 1 cm- 1, pH 7.0); hypoxanthine, 249.5 (10.7 mM- 1 cm- 1, pH 6.0). The concentration of p-nitrophenyl riboside was determined by measuring the absorbance change upon complete hydrolysis in 2.5 M NaOH at 15 °C (405 nm = 18.3 mM- 1 cm- 1). Nucleosides and purine solutions were made in deionised water and used freshly except for 7-methyl guanosine and p-nitrophenyl riboside which were stored as frozen stock solutions. p-Nitrophenyl riboside was kindly provided by Annelies Goeminne (University of Antwerp). The purification and storage of recombinant TvNH were described previously [10]. Bovine xanthine oxidase was purchased as a suspension (28 mg/ml) in 2.3 M ammonium sulphate.

2.2. Stopped-flow absorbance and fluorescence
The experimental procedures and data analysis for single mixing experiments were described previously [10]. Progress curves were corrected by subtracting control progress curves (substrate mixed with buffer only).  values for substrate hydrolysis were determined by measuring the absorbance change upon complete hydrolysis of substrate. Some selected values are: pNPR, 400 nm (15.5 mM- 1 cm- 1, pH 8.0); Ino, 258 nm (0.45 mM- 1 cm- 1, pH 8.5); Guo, 260 nm (- 4.5 mM- 1 cm- 1, pH 7.0). A pathlength of 1 cm was used for the

absorbance measurements. For sequential mixing experiments, the manufacturers' (Applied Photophysics) guidelines were followed. All progress curves were collected at 5 °C.

2.3. Xanthine oxidase-coupled assay
The release of free hypoxanthine during turnover of inosine was detected using a xanthine oxidase-coupled assay [17]. Assays were carried out in 50 mM phosphate, pH 8.5, close to the pH optimum for bovine xanthine oxidase [18]. A solution of inosine-containing xanthine oxidase (0.2­2.2 mg/ml) was rapidly mixed with TvNH and the absorbance change at 293 nm due to the enzymatic oxidation of hypoxanthine to uric acid monitored (293 = 12.4 mM- 1 cm- 1). At low concentrations of xanthine oxidase, the progress curve contains an initial lag which probably originates from build-up of xanthine. The lag is followed by a steady-state phase which has a gradient that is proportional to the xanthine oxidase concentration. Under these conditions, uric acid is produced at a slower rate than ribose. At higher concentrations of xanthine oxidase, the lag period is much shorter and a burst is apparent. Under these conditions, the steady-state rate is independent of the xanthine oxidase concentration and equals the rate of /[E] for TvNH. The hypoxanthine burst amplitude is calculated as the difference in absorbance between the absorbance at t = 0, and the y-intercept of a linear fit to the steady-state portion of the progress curve. It should be noted that this method can also be used to determine if chemistry proceeds faster than product release in NHs that display high Km values (e.g., mutants). Direct measurement of the hydrolysis burst is not possible in such cases because of the high optical density from substrate in the UV region.

When the guanosine concentration is sufficiently high, k2  k2.  In order to calculate the extent of partitioning of the [TvNH.inosine] complex from the observed change in amplitude of the hypoxanthine burst, it is necessary to estimate the concentration of [TvNH.inosine] complex present at the end of the pre-mixing step. This can be calculated if the concentrations of active site, free TvNH and product bound TvNH at the end of the pre-mixing step are known: ESðtÞ ¼ Eð0Þ À EðtÞ À EPðtÞ t E(0) E(t) ES(t) EP(t) ð2Þ

2.4. Determination of forward commitment by sequential mixing stopped-flow
Partitioning of the [TvNH.inosine] complex must be performed in the presteady state because the concentration of ES in the steady state is negligible (the rate-determining step is product ribose release). We developed a novel sequential mixing stopped-flow method to determine the forward commitment as an alternative to the rapid quench approach that uses radioactive substrates [19,4]. The [TvNH.inosine] complex is formed upon mixing TvNH and inosine in a pre-mixing step (Scheme 3). After 21­25 ms, the aged pre-mix solution is mixed rapidly with an equal volume of the contents of drive syringe C that contains xanthine oxidase and the competitive substrate guanosine. The amplitude of the free hypoxanthine product burst is then measured at 293 nm as a function of guanosine concentration. The amplitude data can be modelled using Scheme 4. In Scheme 4, the forward commitment Cf = k3/k2. The hypoxanthine burst amplitude depends on the extent to which the [TvNH.

E(0) is estimated from the observed hypoxanthine burst amplitude in the absence of guanosine (Ainit). Note that the active site concentration in the premix delay line is two-fold greater than the observed burst amplitude because of the dilution in the second mixing step (i.e., E(0) = 2 × Ainit). E(t) is estimated from Eq. (3): EðtÞ ¼ Eð0Þ Â expðÀkFlu Â tÞ ð3Þ

where kFlu = observed rate constant for the fluorescence transient 3 (i.e., net consumption of free E, Scheme 5). kFlu is obtained by measurement of the fluorescence transient 3 in a separate experiment (Fig. 1A and B). Note that the concentration of free TvNH in the steady state is negligibly small because the concentration of inosine in the pre-mix step is N10 Km. EP(t) is estimated from Eq. (4): EPðtÞ ¼ Eð0Þ Â ½1 À expðÀkAbs Â tÞ ð4Þ

where kAbs = observed rate constant for absorbance transient 1 (i.e., net rate of N-glycosidic bond cleavage, Scheme 5). The observed rate constant for chemistry (kAbs) is obtained from stopped-flow absorbance (Fig. 1A and B). Simulated progress curves for E(t), ES(t) and [EP(t)] are shown in Fig. 2. The amount of product hypoxanthine formed in the presence of saturating guanosine is given by Eq. (5):  2 Â Asat ¼ EPðtÞ þ k3 k3 þ k2  Â ES ðt Þ ð5Þ

where Asat = hypoxanthine burst amplitude in the presence of saturating guanosine. Thus, the total hypoxanthine produced is equal to the hypoxanthine formed in the pre-mixing step (=EP(t)) plus the hypoxanthine formed from forward partitioning of ES(t) in the presence of saturating guanosine. Eq. (5) can be rearranged to give Eq. (6): 2 Â Asat À EPðtÞ k3 ¼ ¼a ESðtÞ k3 þ k2 ð6Þ

J.N. Barlow, J. Steyaert / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1774 (2007) 1451­1461 We estimated that the relative errors on kAbs, kFlu, Ainit and Asat to be no greater than 10%. The estimated relative errors on the enzyme species were calculated, using the error propagation equation [20], to be 9­13% for E(t), 10­ 12% for EP(t) and 38­74% for ES(t). The large relative error on ES(t) arises because ES(t) represents the difference in two experimental values. In order to reduce error, the experiment was performed at several different concentrations of inosine. As a further check, simulated stopped-flow absorbance and fluorescence progress curves were generated using the program KintecSim [21] in order to compare simulated kflu and kabs with the observed values (shown in Table 1). The value of Cf was also checked by comparing the calculated and observed kcat/Km, using Eq. (8): kcat k1 Â Cf ¼ Km 1 þ Cf ð8Þ

where k1 = substrate association rate constant obtained from the simulations (3 M- 1 s- 1). Note that this value is larger than the estimated k1 obtained from the slope of a plot of the observed rate constant for the fluorescence transient 3 versus [inosine] (1.61 ± 0.12 M- 1 s- 1, Fig. 1B). This probably arises because single exponential approximations were used to fit the progress curves whereas they are in fact sums of several exponential functions that cannot be resolved. The calculated values of kcat/Km for inosine (1.8 M- 1 s- 1) is similar to the observed values at 35 °C (1.0 M- 1 s- 1) suggesting that the calculated Cf value is indeed relevant.

2.5. Solvent isotope effect measurements
The pD of buffers made up in deuterium oxide was adjusted with DCl and measured with a glass electrode. The meter reading was corrected using the relation: pD = (meter reading) + 0.4 [22]. D2O-containing buffers were used on the day of making and consisted of 50 mM phosphate buffers at 0.2 M ionic strength with NaCl. Progress curves were collected at pL = 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.5 in order to determine the pH at which (rate)/(pH)  0 [23]. This occurred at pH 7.0 and pD = 7.5 for the absorbance progress curves. No changes in the pH during turnover under stopped-flow conditions were detected as a result of weak buffering capacity of phosphate at pH 8.5. The  for N-glycosidic bond cleavage was determined in both protium and deuterium-containing buffers. TvNH was not exchanged into D2O-containing buffer. However, the final concentration of H2O was b2% in stopped-flow absorbance and b0.2% in stopped-flow fluorescence. No change in enzyme activity was observed in D2Ocontaining buffer after three hours of incubation on ice.

[Inosine] = 50 M, TvNH = 5 M (curve i) or 0.5 M (curve ii), pH 8.5, 5 °C. The observed rate constants of the transients were plotted as a function of inosine concentration, as shown in panel B. The observed rate constants for the fluorescence transient 3 (substrate binding, closed triangles) correspond to kFlu and fitted to a straight line with slope = 1.61 ± 0.12 s- 1 M- 1 and y-intercept = 8.5 ± 5.3 s- 1. The observed rate constants for the absorbance transient 1 (inosine hydrolysis, closed squares) correspond to kAbs. The value at 100 M inosine was determined by extrapolation using a linear fit. The rate constants for the fluorescence transient 4 and absorbance transient 4 (product nucleobase release, open triangles and squares, respectively) are also shown.

2.6. Analysis of solvent isotope effect progress curves
Following the analysis of Maniscalco et al. [24], solvent isotope effects on stopped-flow absorbance transients were estimated by comparison of reaction

The following solutions were introduced into the drive syringes of the sequential mixing stopped-flow (Scheme 3): Drive Syringe C (0.28 mg/ml xanthine oxidase containing 0­0.6 mM guanosine, pH 8.5); Drive Syringe B (50 M inosine, pH 8.5); Drive Syringe A (10 M TvNH, pH 8.5). Drive Syringe D (not shown in Scheme 3) was used to push the pre-mix and the contents of syringe C into the observation cell and contained 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.5. The drive sequence was initiated by mixing equal volumes of the contents of syringes A and B to form a pre-mix solution. Some inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity by high concentrations of guanosine was detected; however, there was no observed effect of guanosine on the burst amplitude in control experiments that used hypoxanthine instead of TvNH and inosine.

state at 5 °C. A burst of hypoxanthine release is observed with an amplitude corresponding to full sites activity (observed amplitude = 2.6 M, predicted for full sites = 2.5 M). This establishes that (i) hypoxanthine release is faster than kcat (i.e., ribose release) and (ii) all the hypoxanthine produced in the first turnover is released before ribose. Thus, product release is strictly ordered with hypoxanthine release occurring prior to ribose release, in contrast to other NHs [3,26]. Fig. 4 shows a plot of the observed burst rate constant versus xanthine oxidase concentration. The saturating rate constant for hypoxanthine release is  2.3 s- 1. This is similar to the saturating rate constant of the fluorescence transient 4 (6.7 ± 0.2 s- 1, Scheme 2) determined by stopped-flow fluorescence (Fig. 1A and B) and which was assigned to base release [10]. 3.2. Determination of the forward commitment (Cf ) for TvNH A novel sequential mixing stopped-flow method was used to determine Cf for TvNH with inosine as substrate. The forward commitment (Cf) describes the probability that substrate bound in the Michaelis complex will proceed to product rather than be re-released as free substrate in the reverse direction [28] (i.e., Cf = k3/k2 in Scheme 4). In brief, TvNH and inosine are mixed in a pre-mix step to form the [TvNH.inosine] complex (Scheme 3). The aged pre-mix solution is rapidly diluted with a solution that contains xanthine oxidase and guanosine and the production of unbound hypoxanthine monitored. Fig. 5A shows the hypoxanthine release progress curves collected at different concentrations of guanosine. The amplitude of the observed hypoxanthine burst decreases as the concentration of guanosine is increased. This is consistent with increased partitioning of the [TvNH.inosine] complex into the [TvNH.guanosine] complex (Scheme 4). Fig. 5B shows a plot of burst amplitude versus guanosine concentration. In the presence of saturating guanosine, the hypoxanthine burst amplitude was reduced by  50%. This decrease corresponds to a Cf = 1.4 (Table 1). The expected amplitude decrease for Cf = 0.1 and Cf = 10 are also shown in Fig. 5A. The Cf was determined at several concentrations of inosine with a mean value = 1.88 ± 0.60 (± standard deviation). 3.3. Transient kinetic analysis of pNPR turnover by wild-type TvNH at pH 8.0 and 5 °C Fig. 6 shows the stopped-flow absorbance progress curve for pNPR turnover in the pre-steady state with detection at 400 nm. A burst of p-nitrophenolate product is detected with a saturating rate constant kpNPR = 0.09 s- 1 at 5 °C. The saturating rate

2.7. Estimation of non-enzymatic rate of pNPR hydrolysis
The rate of pNPR hydrolysis in 1 M NaOH was measured at 15­45 °C in order to estimate the bimolecular specific base rate constant kOH. An Arrhenius plot of the data was linear, with kOH = 6.4 M- 1 min- 1 at 78.2 °C (predicted = 1.99 M- 1 min- 1, from Reference [25]) and kOH = 4.13 × 10- 3 M- 1 min- 1 at 5 °C. This gives a specific base-catalysed apparent first-order rate constant kOH/[OH-] = 6.88 × 10- 11 s- 1 at pH 8 and 5 °C. The rate of the specificacid and spontaneous hydrolytic pathways under these conditions is predicted to be roughly the same as this, based on the rate constants determined at 78.2 °C [25]. Thus, kuncat = 1.7 × 10- 10 s- 1 (5 °C) and 3.2 × 10- 9 s- 1 (30 °C; published value at pH 7 = 3.2 × 10- 8 s- 1, Table 2 [5]). We also estimated the rate of solution solvolysis of purine nucleosides at 5 °C and pH 6 to be 1.26 × 10- 13 s- 1 (Table 2) using the adenosine hydrolysis data of Table 3 in Reference [26]. The rate of adenosine hydrolysis at pH 6 is reported to be similar to that at pH 8 because of the increased contribution of specific-base catalysis [27].

3. Results 3.1. Determination of the order of product release for TvNH Previous considerations of TvNH kinetics and structure led to the proposal that TvNH follows an ordered uni­bi kinetic mechanism and not the rapid-equilibrium random uni­bi kinetics observed with CfNH [10]. We tested this hypothesis here by determining the order of product release.

rate is faster than chemistry and because the fluorescence decays rather than increases. Instead, the slow transient observed with pNPR possibly arises from an additional isomerisation step prior to chemistry. 3.4. Solvent isotope effect measurements for guanosine in the pre-steady state We examined the effects of deuterium oxide on the presteady-state kinetics of guanosine turnover by TvNH at 5 °C. Fig. 8A shows the stopped-flow absorbance progress curve for guanosine turnover in H2O. The progress curves were well fitted to a double exponential decay with linear steady state, as judged by the appearance of the residual (Fig. 8A). The fits were differentiated to obtain velocity progress curves (Fig. 8A), from which the reaction velocity at t = 0 was estimated. Fig. 8B shows a plot of initial velocity versus guanosine concentration in H2O and D2O. The saturated initial velocities (at infinite guanosine concentration) were estimated to be 52 ± 12 s- 1 (H2O) and 31 ± 6 s- 1 (D2O), giving a solvent isotope effect = 1.68 ± 0.51. As chemistry is not the first step on the reaction pathway but minimally follows the substrate binding step, it is possible that the observed solvent isotope effect on chemistry originates from a step prior to chemistry. This possibility was examined by measuring the kinetics of guanosine binding. Fig. 8C shows the stopped-flow fluorescence progress curve for guanosine turnover in H2O and D2O at pH 7.5. The two transients in the progress curve correspond to substrate binding (3) and product nucleobase release (4). As the magnitudes of the rate constants for the two transients are considerably (N 5-fold) different, we can attribute the observed solvent isotope effect at t = 0 to effects on substrate binding only. Fig. 8D shows the solvent isotope effect at t = 0 as a function of guanosine concentration. As the observed solvent isotope effect is equal to unity, the observed solvent isotope effect on chemistry cannot originate from the binding step. A solvent isotope effect (N 1.0) is

Stopped-flow absorbance data was simulated to the following model using the program DynaFit [39] to obtain rate constants k1­k4:

The simulated steady-state parameters are those calculated from the simulated rate constants using the relationships kcat/Km =k1·k3 / (k2 +k3) and kcat =k3·k4 / (k3 +k4). b Observed burst rate at 1 mM pNPR. c Observed steady-state rate (v/E) at 1 mM pNPR.

constant for the burst is ca. 10-fold faster than kcat (0.01 s- 1). kcat for pNPR must therefore represent a step subsequent to chemistry. The kinetics of pNPR binding to TvNH was examined by stopped-flow detection of TvNH tryptophan fluorescence during pNPR turnover in the pre-steady state. Fig. 7 shows the fluorescence progress curve for TvNH at different concentrations of pNPR. The fluorescence decay is biphasic with a fast and a slow phase. The faster phase likely corresponds to substrate binding. The observed rate constant for the faster transient (3pNPR) shows evidence for saturation at high pNPR concentrations (insert, Fig. 7), consistent with two-step pNPR binding. The observed rate constant for the slower transient also increases with increasing pNPR concentration albeit at a much slower rate (0.22­1.34 s- 1, insert Fig. 7). This transient is unlikely to originate from p-nitrophenolate release because the

Also indicated are the predicted saturating burst amplitudes for Cf = 0.1 and 10.

TvNH also differs from CfNH in showing considerable forward commitment with inosine as substrate (i.e., TvNH shows Briggs­Haldane kinetics). The rate of inosine release (k  50 s- 1, Scheme 6) is three orders of magnitude faster than the release of ribose, indicating considerable conformational differences between the [TvNH.inosine] and [TvNH.ribose] complexes (ES and ER in Scheme 6). The [TvNH.inosine] complex is thought to have a closed active site structure, as observed in the complex of TvNH with the transition-state analogue inhibitor immucillin-H [7]. This structure also indicates that opening of loop 2 (residues 245­257) is required for product nucleobase release to occur. It is therefore conceivable that the rate of substrate release and product nucleobase release (k = 6.7 s- 1, Scheme 6) are determined by opening of loop 2. Experiments to test this hypothesis using mutagenesis are currently underway.

also observed on the 4 transient but cannot be quantified using the procedure of Maniscalco et al. [24]. 4. Discussion 4.1. Kinetics of inosine turnover by TvNH Scheme 6 shows a kinetic model for hydrolysis of inosine by TvNH based on the data collected at pH 8.5 and 5 °C. The scheme is simpler than that shown for guanosine (Scheme 2) because only one apparent rate of chemistry is seen with inosine (1, Fig. 1A). This may be caused by the poorer signal to noise in the inosine progress curve as a result of the ca. 5-fold smaller extinction coefficient change. Otherwise, the schemes for guanosine and inosine are similar. The observation of a full-site burst of hypoxanthine release from TvNH in the pre-steady state (Fig. 3) confirms our previous conclusions that product release is strictly ordered [10]. Therefore, TvNH follows an ordered uni­bi kinetic mechanism and not the rapid-equilibrium random uni­bi kinetics observed with CfNH [3].

It also remains to be tested whether a conformation change upstream of chemistry rate determines the observed product burst with purine nucleoside substrates. Rate-determining conformation changes could provide an explanation for the relatively flat pH profile for the chemistry transient 1 and 2 observed with guanosine. In principle, this possibility can be tested by measurement of kinetic isotope effects on these transients. It should be noted that determination of intrinsic kinetic isotope effects on kcat/Km may be challenging because of the very low Km (1 M or less) and high forward commitment of TvNH with purine nucleoside substrates. We have observed (SI Figs. 1­3) that the saturating rate constant for the 1 (chemistry, Scheme 2) transient is somewhat faster with 7methyl guanosine as substrate than with guanosine (101.9 ± 9.1 s- 1 versus 63 ± 16 s- 1 at pH 7.0, 5 °C for 7-methyl guanosine and guanosine, respectively). By contrast the saturating rate constant for 2 (Scheme 2) for these substrates are equal (9.5 ±

2.4 s- 1 versus 10.5 ± 4.3 s- 1). With the assumption that the rates of upstream conformational changes are less likely to be affected by methylation at N-7 than chemistry, these data are consistent with our model (Scheme 2) in which 1 represents intrinsic chemistry and 2 a conformation change upstream of chemistry. 4.2. Kinetics of pNPR turnover by TvNH Scheme 7 shows a kinetic model for hydrolysis of pNPR by TvNH based on the data collected at pH 8.0 and 5 °C. The observation that kcat for pNPR does not represent the rate of chemistry was surprising because kcat for pNPR is significantly lower than that observed for purine nucleoside substrates (0.01 s- 1 versus 0.04 s- 1). This implies that kcat for pNPR represents a step upstream of product ribose release. The absence of a product release transient in the stopped-flow fluorescence progress curve (corresponding to the fluorescent transient 4,

Scheme 2) is consistent with p-nitrophenolate release as the ratedetermining step (RDS). Although precedent for partially ratedetermining p-nitrophenolate release is seen in CfNH [5], it is not apparent why p-nitrophenolate should be released ca. 600fold more slowly than purine nucleobases from the TvNH active site. Alternatively, it is possible that the [TvNH.ribose] complex formed during pNPR turnover has a different structure to that formed during purine nucleoside turnover. Precedent for this is seen in the nucleoside phosphorylase (NP) reaction [29]. Two different rates of breakdown in the [NP.hypoxanthine] product complex are observed in the phosphorolysis and hydrolysis reactions, implying that the structures of [NP.hypoxanthine] also differ in the two pathways. The observation that the rate constant for the pNPR binding transient shows saturation behaviour (insert, Fig. 7) indicates that the pNPR binding step is a rapid equilibrium (i.e., Cf  0). This conclusion is supported by computer simulation of the stopped-flow absorbance data using a three-step mechanism in which rapid equilibrium substrate binding is followed by irreversible chemistry (Table 3). The rate constants obtained by non-linear fitting to the simulated progress curves were similar to the observed rate constants. The steady-state parameters calculated from these simulated rate constants were also similar to the observed (Table 3). 4.3. Calculation of the energetic contribution of leaving group activation The G  for enzymatic transition-state stabilisation relative to that in solution may be estimated from the expression G = - RTln (kcat)/kuncat), where kcat and kuncat correspond to the rate constants for the catalysed and uncatalysed reactions, respectively [30]. The TvNH-catalysed rates of purine nucleoside and pNPR hydrolysis (kcat) were obtained from the stopped-flow data as described above. We estimated kuncat for purine nucleoside solvolysis by extrapolation of the published rates for adenosine [27] and that for pNPR from an Arrhenius plot made at high pH and kcat from the saturating burst rate for pNPR hydrolysis (see Experimental procedures). These rate constants are shown in Table 2. As mentioned in the Introduction, the rate enhancement (or G) for pNPR is thought to arise principally from binding interactions to the ribosyl moiety. This involves, presumably, both stabilisation of an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state and activation of the substrate water for nucleophilic attack at the anomeric carbon of ribose. The rate enhancement for purine nucleoside substrates arises from activation of both the ribosyl and leaving group moieties. The difference in G values for these two substrates therefore corresponds to the energetic contribution of leaving group activation. The G values are

shown in Table 4. It can be seen that ribosyl activation apparently makes 60% of the total catalytic contribution and leaving group activation 40% of the total binding energy with purine nucleosides. Thus, the relative energetic contributions of ribosyl and leaving group activation in TvNH are intermediate between those reported for the base-aspecific CfNH and the purine-specific TbbNH. The - 7.6 kcal/mol stabilisation energy attributed to leaving group activation (Table 4) is equivalent to a change in pKa of ca. +6 pKa units. This is similar to the minimum increase in pKa at N-7 of the bound substrate that would be consistent with the observed pH rate profile for chemistry (see Introduction). However, TvNH shows high activity even when the solution pH is similar to the pKa of the departed leaving group (hypoxanthine pKa = 8.76; guanine pKa = 9.22, [31]). Under these conditions, protonation of the leaving group becomes thermodynamically unfavourable in both nucleoside substrate and nucleobase product and catalysis by protonation becomes ineffective [12,13]. These considerations imply that other binding interactions to the leaving group must make significant contributions to the observed leaving group activation energy. It should also be noted that other cation­ and arene­arene systems generally show much smaller ( 1 kcal/mol) interaction energies [32]. For example, cation­ interactions between Trp 94 and His 18 in barnase were shown to increase the pKa of His 18 by only 0.5 pKa units (0.8­1 kcal/mol [33]). Significantly more binding energy was reported for the binding of 7-methyl guanosine to the eIF4E cap-binding protein (- 4.9 kcal/mol [34]), where cation­ interactions to the nucleobase operate in concert with hydrogen bonding. As extensive mutagenesis of the leaving group binding pocket in TvNH has failed to indicate important roles for any residues other than Trp 260 and, to a smaller extent, Trp 83 [35,7], we propose that the pNPR data might overestimate the energetic contribution of leaving group activation. This would occur if binding interactions to the leaving group acted cooperatively to assist ribosyl activation. For example, pNPR may be unable to induce the closed form of TvNH that is believed to be formed during natural nucleoside hydrolysis, resulting in poor ribosyl activation [7].

4.4. Solvent isotope effects The observed solvent isotope effect on chemistry (D2Ok = 1.7) is within the range observed for solvation catalytic proton bridges (i.e., strong hydrogen bonds) between oxygen and nitrogen [23] and is somewhat larger than those reported for the base-aspecific CfNH (D2Okcat/Km = 0.9; D2Okcat = 1.3, [4]). A similar solvent isotope effect was observed with 7-methyl guanosine as substrate at pH 7.0 (D2Ok = 1.6, data not shown). However, it would appear unlikely that hydrogen bonding between the solvent and N-7 of guanosine would provide a large energetic contribution because the pKa values of the donor (- 1.3 for H3O+, 15.7 for H2O) and acceptor (2 in the nucleoside, 9 in the product nucleobase) do not match. One possibility is that the solvent isotope effect originates from a conformation change that rate determines chemistry. By contrast, inverse solvent isotope effects of 0.42­0.5 are observed during specific acid-catalysed hydrolysis of nucleosides and 7-methyl nucleosides in the pH dependent region (i.e., pH  pKa, [36]). Therefore, the observed normal solvent isotope effect does not support a pre-protonation mechanism in which the N-7 protonated species represents an intermediate prior to N-glycosidic bond cleavage. It should be noted that the saturating rate of chemistry (1) with guanosine as substrate is slow enough to allow hydroxonium ion to be the proton donor. The bimolecular rate for proton transfer from hydroxonium is ca. 1010 M- 1 s- 1 [37]. At pH 7, k[H3O+] = 103 s- 1 which decreases to 102 s- 1 at pH 8, compared to the observed rate of 1 of 75 s- 1 (pH 7) and 120 s- 1 (pH 8). 4.5. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of performing steadystate and transient kinetics with multiple substrates and at different temperatures in order to obtain meaningful mechanistic conclusions for enzymes that follow complex, multi-step pathways. The purine-specific TvNH differs from the baseaspecific CfNH in that it displays Briggs­Haldane kinetics and ordered product release. TvNH is similar to many other enzymes in that chemistry is not rate determining [38] in the steady state. A major problem that has yet to be definitively answered in TvNH is whether a step upstream of chemistry that involves a conformation change (e.g., active site loop closure) rate determines the stopped-flow chemistry transient 1. If this is the case, then the catalytic rate enhancement of TvNH must be even greater than the 5 × 1014 rate enhancement indicated in this work (Table 2). However, the faster apparent rate of the 1 transient observed with 7-methyl guanosine compared to guanosine is consistent with rate-determining chemistry. In this case, the observed pH dependency and solvent isotope effects would favour concerted transfer of a proton from solvent rather than stepwise transfer. We propose that leaving group interactions may be required for efficient ribosyl activation, perhaps via an induced fit mechanism. This would explain the catalytic importance of Trp 260 in catalysis, the low activity shown by pNPR and the observed ordering of active site

structure in the nucleobase binding pocket upon transition-state analogue binding [7].
