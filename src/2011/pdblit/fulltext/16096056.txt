Unlike numerous other mechanisms of transcription regulation that rely on protein transcription factors that bind to the RNAP and/or extended signature DNA motifs, stringent control depends on the action of a single nucleotide, ppGpp, that is synthesized primarily by the product of the relA gene in a ribosome-dependent manner (Cashel et al., 1996). Upon binding to RNAP, ppGpp inhibits transcription of one set of genes and stimulates transcription of the other (Cashel et al., 1996; Chatterji et al., 1998; Jores and Wagner, 2003; Toulokhonov et al., 2001). Although inhibition of transcript elongation by ppGpp has been reported, ppGpp acts primarily at the stage of transcription initiation, during the formation of the open promoter complex, and/or during the first few rounds of RNA synthesis (Cashel et al., 1996; Wagner, 2002). Therefore, it is thought that the major specificity determinants for regulation by ppGpp are intrinsic to the negatively regulated promoters, which are distinguished by several characteristic features: (1) the presence of a so-called GC-rich "discriminator" sequence between the 10 promoter region and the start site of transcription ( 1); (2) a shortened 16 bp spacer between the 35 and 10 elements of the promoter; (3) noncanonical sequence of the 35 region; and (4) the formation of short-lived open complexes (Barker et al., 2001a, 2001b; Cashel et al., 1996; Travers, 1984). Although the dependence of ppGpp control on these features has been experimentally established for some promoters (Barker et al., 2001a, 2001b; Figueroa-Bossi et al., 1998; Lamond and Travers, 1985; Mizushima-Sugano and Kaziro, 1985; Park et al., 2002), this dependence is not absolute (Da Costa and Artz, 1997; Potrykus et al., 2002b; Zacharias et al., 1989, 1990), and the features themselves are not well conserved. Despite numerous attempts, the binding site for ppGpp in RNAP remains undefined (Chatterji et al., 1998; Jores and Wagner, 2003; Toulokhonov et al., 2001). Thus, the mechanism by which ppGpp selectively regulates transcription of a large number of genes remains obscure. The structure reported here shows that ppGpp binds to a single site at the RNAP holoenzyme surface close to the active center in two alternative orientations. We suggest that ppGpp binding might affect interactions of the NTP substrates with RNAP by altering the active site configuration and that ppGpp might also directly interact with the nontemplate (NT) DNA strand in the transcription bubble. These observations provide new insights into the mechanism of transcription regulation by ppGpp. Results and Discussion Structure Determination and Validation The structure of the T. thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme, which consists of six polypeptides ( dimer, , , ,

Summary Guanosine-tetraphosphate (ppGpp) is a major regulator of stringent control, an adaptive response of bacte° ria to amino acid starvation. The 2.7 A resolution structure of the Thermus thermophilus RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme in complex with ppGpp reveals that ppGpp binds to the same site near the active center in both independent RNAP molecules in the crystal but in strikingly distinct orientations. Binding is symmetrical with respect to the two diphosphates of ppGpp and is relaxed with respect to the orientation of the nucleotide base. Different modes of ppGpp binding are coupled with asymmetry of the active site configurations. The results suggest that base pairing of ppGpp with cytosines in the nontemplate DNA strand might be an essential component of transcription control by ppGpp. We present experimental evidence highlighting the importance of base-specific contacts between ppGpp and specific cytosine residues during both transcription initiation and elongation.

The water molecules were added until Rfree dropped by less than 0.5% at the last cycle.

Unambiguous electron density (ED) was observed for Fnati| difference map produced ppGpp in the |FppGpp after complete refinement (including water molecules) of the RNAP structure using RNAP/ppGpp complex data in the absence of ppGpp. FppGpp and Fnati are the structural factors of the RNAP/ppGpp complex and RNAP alone, respectively (see Supplemental Figures S1A and S1B at http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/117/3/299/DC1). This ED clearly indicated that a single ppGpp molecule binds to each of the two independent RNAP molecules (designated as RNAP1 and RNAP2) in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. However, modeling showed that ppGpp could fit into the experimental ED in two alternative orientations, designated as 5 and 3 for the proximity of the 5 and 3 diphosphates of ppGpp to the active site Asp residues 739, 741, and 743. Whereas ppGpp in the 5 orientation fit better to the ED in RNAP1, the 3 orientation was preferable for ppGpp modeling in the ED of RNAP2 (Supplemental Figure S1). Complete refinements of the RNAP/ppGpp complex structures were carried out in an identical manner for all three potential modes of ppGpp binding: both ppGpp molecules in the 5 orientation, both in the 3 orientation, and two ppGpps in different orientations (5 in the RNAP1 and 3 in the RNAP2). The results were evaluated by simulated annealing omit ED maps provided for ppGpps in both RNAP molecules after refinement, as ppGpp contribution to the other major crystallographic criteria (Rfree and stereochemical quality of the entire structure)

was negligible. Only the structure with the different ppGpp orientations provided good omit ED for the ppGpps in both RNAP molecules (Figures 1A­1C). Also, when both ppGpps were modeled in either the 5 or 3 orientation, the omit ED for the base moieties was poor in RNAP2 or RNAP1, respectively (Supplemental Figures S2A­S2D). Overall Structure There are no large conformational changes in RNAP structure induced by the ppGpp binding. Only slight interdomain movements are observed in the RNAP/ ppGpp complex as compared to the apoholoenzyme (Vassylyev et al., 2002), whereas intradomain structures were unaffected. The structures of RNAP1 and RNAP2 were also quite similar, with the largest deviations of ° 4­5 A observed for peripheral domains, far away from the active center and the ppGpp binding sites (Figure 1D). These conformational differences between RNAP1 and RNAP2, which are probably induced by crystal packing rather than by binding of ppGpp, gradually decrease toward the active center and ppGpp binding site ° to maximal deviations of 1.5­2 A in the C positions (Figure 1D). Notably, the largest differences in conformations between RNAP1 and RNAP2 involve the subunit, the subunits, and subunit domain ( 134­ 349) (Figure 1D), which interact with the promoter DNA in the open complex (Mekler et al., 2002; Vassylyev et al., 2002). In particular, the domain likely interacts with the NT DNA strand in the discriminator region, which consequently may affect its orientation/conformation. Notably, the domain forms an extensive hydrophobic

core within the central domain of RNAP, which contains active site and ppGpp binding residues. This hydrophobic interface therefore may link the nucleic acid conformation to the ppGpp binding mode. On one hand, the mode of ppGpp binding is likely to depend on the observed alternative conformations of RNAP. On the other hand, the regulatory function of ppGpp strongly correlates with the stability of open complexes at promoters with distinct characteristic features (Cashel et al., 1996). It is therefore possible that the differences between the two RNAP molecules might mimic those induced during the open complex formation at positively and negatively regulated promoters. Alternatively, in the absence of nucleic acids, the 5 and 3 ppGpp binding modes could be at equilibrium that may be shifted in the crystal by the specific RNAP conformations induced by crystal packing and may also be subject to control by yet unidentified regulatory proteins. In any case, the structure of the RNAP/ppGpp complex suggests that the signal, which originates from altered

orientations of the peripheral protein domains and is transduced toward the RNAP active center, defines the orientations (5 or 3 ) of the bound ppGpp. In the structure, there are seven functionally important Mg2 ions bound to the diphosphates of ppGpp and/or active site residues. All of these Mg2 ions meet three major criteria that distinguish metal ions from water molecules in the crystal structures. First, they are characterized by 9 level of EDs on average in the omit ED maps (Figures 1A and 1B). Second, each of them has at least three oxygen ligands maintaining nearly octahedral coordination (see Supplemental Table S1 at Cell website). Third, the Mg2 coordination bonds with oxygen ° ligands that range from 2.2 to 2.4 A, which is considered too short for the hydrogen bonds formed by water molecules. Moreover, if these atoms are modeled as water oxygens, the B factors go to zero during refinement, the ° value far below the average B factor of 66 A2 calculated for the solvent molecules (Table 1) but consistent with metal ions. Given that crystallization was carried out in

Cell 302

the presence of 13 mM Mg-formate, whereas no other metal ions (i.e., Ca2 ) were added during purification and crystallization, the data strongly argue that these sites are occupied by Mg2 ions. ppGpp Binding The ppGpp binding site is located in a substrate entry channel next to the RNAP active center (Figure 2A). With few exceptions, ppGpp molecules in both the 5 and 3 orientations are recognized by the same RNAP residues (Figures 2B and 2C). The ppGpp binding site can be divided into three subsites for (1) the proximal (with respect to the active site) diphosphate of ppGpp, (2) the distal diphosphate, and (3) the guanosine base. No direct interactions with the protein were observed for the ppGpp ribose. The proximal diphosphates are hydrogen bonded to two highly conserved basic residues, Arg 879 and Arg 1029. In addition, there are Mg2 -mediated (pMG1, Figures 2B and 2C) interactions of these phosphates with the invariant Glu 865. In the 3 but not in the 5 orientation, the canonical active site Asp 739 also coordinates the pMG1 ion (Figure 2C). The proximal diphosphates seem to be firmly positioned in both ppGpp orientations, as all six pMG1 ligands (including three and two water molecules for the 5 and 3 orientations, respectively) are clearly visible in the ED map even at the relatively modest resolution of the data (Figures 2B and 2C). We therefore presume that the proper conformation and binding of these diphosphates as well as the pMG1 ion are crucial to the regulatory function of ppGpp. Consistently, the significant structural differences between RNAP1 and RNAP2, which probably determine the mode (5 or 3 ) of ppGpp binding, occur at the proximal diphosphate binding subsite. Indeed, in RNAP1, the two principal residues, Arg 879 and Glu 865, are shifted toward ppGpp phosphates as compared with their orientation in RNAP2. This probably provides optimal binding of ppGpp in the 5 orientation but would likely result in steric hindrance with the ppGpp phosphates in the 3 orientation (data not shown). The distal diphosphates of ppGpps in both orientations are also fixed through hydrogen bonds with two basic residues, Arg 783 and Lys 908. These amino acids are not highly conserved among the RNAPs. In particular, Arg 783 is found only in a few species. The sequences flanking Lys 908 are divergent, and all are rich in basic residues that may compensate for the absence of Arg 783. One Mg2 ion (pMG2, Figures 2B and 2C) is bound to the distal phosphates of the ppGpp. In contrast to pMG1, pMG2 makes no direct interactions with amino acid residues and is probably fixed through water-mediated coordination. Although the distal subsite is crucial for discrimination of ppGpp from other nucleotides (e.g., NTPs), the binding pocket is not well conserved in sequence, and the binding mode seems to be more flexible than that of the proximal phosphates. The apparent flexibility of this subsite might be important for precise positioning of the proximal phosphates and nucleotide base in the alternative orientation. Additional basic residues located in the vicinity of both diphosphate subsites do not interact with ppGpp but could bind the triphosphate of the ppGpp precusor

pppGpp, another closely related regulator of stringent response (Cashel et al., 1996). Base-specific recognition of nucleotides (for example, ATP by ATP binding proteins) is typically achieved within a compact protein pocket into which the nucleotide base fits tightly through complementary shape and chemical properties. The cavity on the RNAP surface in which the ppGpp base is buried, however, is too big to provide highly specific recognition of the guanosine base and to restrict its orientation (Figures 2B and 2C). All residues interacting with the ppGpp guanosine are located in the regions of the enzyme that are far away from each other in space and that do not interact with other protein residues that might restrict the conformation and orientation of their side chains, making the ppGpp base subsite quite relaxed with respect to spatial location of the guanosine in either orientation. Subtle alterations of the side chain of the major guanosine discriminating residue, the highly conserved Glu 1231, allow formation of similarly strong hydrogen bonds with the N1 and N2 atoms of the ppGpp base in both orientations. Two other base-interacting residues, the invariant Asn 737 and Gln 1235, flip their side chain amide groups to allow recognition of either the N2 or the O6 of ppGpp guanosine in the 5 or 3 orientation (Figures 2B and 2C). Some bacteria synthesize adenosine tetraphosphate ppApp (Oki et al., 1975), which affects transcription of some stringently controlled genes (Travers, 1978). The flexible architecture of the ppGpp base subsite suggests that ppApp might also be accommodated in the same binding site. The structure of the T. thermophilus RNAP/ppGpp complex reported here offers new insights into the mechanism of stringent response; however, there is a dearth of biochemical data functionally linking T. thermophilus enzyme with this alarmone. In order to validate our data and the resulting structural model of RNAPppGpp complex from the functional point of view, we demonstrated the essential congruity of ppGpp effect on both T. thermophilus and Escherichia coli RNAPs in vitro (see Supplemental Data, "In Vitro ppGpp Effects on T. thermophilus RNAP," and Supplemental Figure S3). These findings are consistent with our view that unique and specific contacts between T. thermophilus RNAP and ppGpp seen in our structure reflect upon an essential and important regulatory interaction. Active Center ° The two catalytic Mg2 ions (cMG1 and cMG2) are 4.2 A apart in the active site of RNAP1 (Figures 1A and 2B). ° They are coordinated (bonds of 2.3­2.4 A) by the three canonical catalytic Asp residues 739, 741, and 743 and the invariant Asp 686. Asp 739 and Asp 741 coordinate cMG1 and cMG2 in a manner similar to that observed in the DNA polymerases/DNA complexes with bound substrate (Doublie et al., 1998). This is consistent with the universal two-metal-mediated mechanism of catalysis proposed for RNA and DNA polymerases (Steitz, 1998; Steitz and Steitz, 1993). The major, highaffinity catalytic Mg2 ion (cMG1) has been seen in all previously determined structures of multisubunit RNAPs (Cramer et al., 2001; Vassylyev et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 1999). However, the location of the second, low-affinity

catalytic Mg2 ion has not been firmly established. In the structure of yeast RNAP (Cramer et al., 2001), a weak ED is interpreted as the cMG2 bound to the counterparts of Glu 685 and Asp 686, but this atom is located too ° far ( 6 A) from cMG1 to participate in substrate NTP binding and catalysis. In the bacterial apoholoenzyme

structure (Vassylyev et al., 2002), two Mg2 ions are bound to the same triad of catalytic aspartates. However, they are not well coordinated by the protein moie° ties and are separated by only 3 A, which is too close for catalysis. It is possible that one of these atoms is a well-fixed water molecule rather than a Mg2 ion. The

data presented here unambiguously implicate Asp 686 as the fourth ligand required to maintain both catalytic Mg2 ions in the active site. Recently, the archaeal counterparts of Asp 686 and the adjacent Glu 685, which in our structure coordinates Mg2 ion (pMG1) bound to ppGpp, were shown to be essential--alanine substitutions of either of these residues greatly reduced and the double substitution completely abolished the enzyme activity (Werner and Weinzierl, 2002). In our structure, Glu 685 is located too far to interact directly with cMG2. We propose that Glu 685 may instead fix a water molecule that would allow coordination of cMG2 in the absence of substrate. The atom observed between Glu 685 and Asp 686 in the yeast RNAP structure might be this functionally important water oxygen. The residual activity of the D686A mutant could be explained by a (second) water molecule bound to the same Glu 685, substituting for the carboxyl oxygen of Asp 686. In contrast to RNAP1, only cMG1 is bound to the RNAP2 active site (Figures 1B and 2C). This difference likely results from the asymmetry in the ppGpp binding: in RNAP1, the Mg2 ion bound to the proximal 5 phos° phate (pMG1) is 1.5 A farther from the active site than in RNAP2, allowing Asp 739 to bridge cMG1 and cMG2 in RNAP1. The water molecule coordinating pMG1 interacts with Asp 739 and may additionally stabilize its conformation to increase affinity for cMG2 (Figures 1A and 3B). In contrast, in RNAP2, Asp 739 coordinates the proximal pMG1, which is well fixed by the ppGpp phosphates, rather than the low affinity cMG2 (Figures 1B and 2C). In RNAP2, the proximal ppGpp phosphates are closer to the active site, allowing Arg 879 to simultaneously make a salt bridge with Asp 686 (Figure 3C). Thus, in agreement with the proposed role for Arg 879 in catalysis (Sosunov et al., 2003), it may prevent cMG2 binding by Asp 686. In RNAP1, the interactions of Arg 879 with Asp 686 are much weaker, if they occur at

all, leaving the side chain of Asp 686 free to coordinate cMG2 (Figure 2B). Substrate Binding The presence of two catalytic Mg2 ions in RNAP1 allowed plausible modeling of the NTP substrate in the RNAP active site (Figure 3). The NTP substrate is bound to the two catalytic Mg2 ions in a manner similar to that observed in DNA polymerases (Doublie et al., 1998), forming an almost perfect base pair with the template (T) strand nucleotide occupying the pretranslocation site in the RNA/DNA hybrid (from the yeast elongation complex structure) previously docked to the T. thermophilus RNAP (Gnatt et al., 2001; Vassylyev et al., 2002). The model leads to three major conclusions: (1) no clash is apparent between ppGpp (in either orientation) and the NTP phosphates; (2) Arg 879 can simultaneously form hydrogen bonds with the ppGpp and the NTP phosphates (Figure 3); and (3) the invariant Asn 737 interacts with the ppGpp guanosine base and is in close proximity to the substrate ribose, suggesting that it may play a role in discrimination between ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides (Figure 3). To evaluate this structural model experimentally, we engineered an E. coli RNAP variant in which the Asn 458 residue (corresponding to Asn 737 in T. thermophilus) was nonconservatively replaced by a serine. This substitution would lead to the loss of interaction with both ppGpp (base) and substrate NTP (ribose). To test the activity of this variant RNAP in vitro, we took advantage of the multicistronic E. coli RNAP expression vector that allows for efficient expression and in vivo assembly of even the highly toxic core enzymes (Artsimovitch et al., 2003). In accordance with our predictions, the N458S-substituted RNAP exhibited reduced sensitivity to ppGpp at the PR promoter when assayed in vitro (Figures 4A­4C). In further support of our model, N458S RNAP also exhibited a 20-fold loss of discrimina-

tion between ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide substrate (V. Svetlov, D.G.V., and I.A., unpublished data). Sequence-Specific Contacts between ppGpp and the NT DNA Strand The proximity of ppGpp to the active site and therefore to the nucleic acids in the transcription bubble suggests that the mechanism of ppGpp control may involve base pairing with cytosine in the NT strand of DNA. Although such a possibility has never been tested directly, it is supported by several reports. First, negatively regulated promoters in E. coli have a C-rich discriminator (GCG CCNCC) sequence located between the 10 box and the 1 site of the NT DNA strand (Travers, 1984). This region is unwound in the open complex and may potentially form base pairs with ppGpp. Second, mutations

of the discriminator sequences that decrease their GC content abolished stringent control both in vivo and in vitro at a number of promoters (Cashel et al., 1996; Figueroa-Bossi et al., 1998; Lamond and Travers, 1985). To evaluate this possibility, we built a model of the open complex based on the previously published model (Mekler et al., 2002) as well as the yeast and T7 RNAP structures (Cramer et al., 2001; Tahirov et al., 2002; Yin and Steitz, 2002) (Figure 5A, see Supplemental Data, "Modeling of the Open Complex," for details). We should note that the model is not highly robust and cannot be used with high confidence at the atomic level. Nevertheless, in the absence of corresponding cocrystal structure of the open complex, it provides two important insights into potential interactions between ppGpp and DNA. First, the base specific interactions between

(B) Enlarged stereo view of the open complex in the vicinity of the active and ppGpp binding sites. ppGpp (blue) in the 3 orientation forms a putative base pair (red dashes) with the NT cytosine.

ppGpp and NT strand nucleotides are possible upon subtle alterations of the RNAP structure (Figure 5B). Second, ppGpp in the 3 orientation (Figure 5B) but not in the 5 orientation would be able to form a WatsonCrick base pair with a cytosine in the NT DNA strand. To test whether the predicted base-specific interaction contributes to the ppGpp effect on transcription, we compared the open complex longevity on PR promoter variants that differ at a single position (Figure 4A). The wild-type promoter has a single C residue at the 1 position of the NT strand (Figures 4A and 4B) and is affected by ppGpp in vitro (Potrykus et al., 2002a). We constructed mutant PR templates containing either a G or a T residue at the 1 position. To avoid complications from ppGpp effects on elongation (Krohn and Wagner, 1996), we used a simplified in vitro transcription assay that relies on the formation of a single phosphodiester bond from the ApU dinucleotide and the labeled GTP substrate (Figure 4A). We found that ppGpp reduces the open complex stability (and/or bond formation) at the

wild-type 1C but not the mutant 1G and 1T PR promoters with the E. coli RNAP (Figures 4A, 4B, 4D, and data not shown). We also observed congruent effects of substitutions in PR on the open complexes formed by the T. thermophilus RNAP (data not shown). These results are in agreement with the proposition that base pairing between ppGpp and the 1 NT strand nucleotide plays an important role in transmitting the regulatory signal from the alarmone to the transcriptional machinery. We have also constructed the rrnB P1 promoter variants that contain substitutions at the 1 and 2 positions (CC in the wild-type promoter). These substitutions both increased the stability of the E. coli RNAP open complexes and decreased their sensitivity to ppGpp (Supplemental Figure S4). In contrast, mutations further upstream in the discriminator sequence (positions 5 to 7), while also increasing the basal rrnB P1 open complex stability, did not abolish ppGpp effect on open complex stability (Barker et al., 2001a). To evaluate the possibility that the transient contacts

Effect of ppGpp on Transcript Elongation by E. coli RNAP The linear DNA templates shown on top encoded the PR promoter followed by 26 nt long C-less region that allows formation of the A26 halted complex, wild-type ops signal, and rrnB T1 terminator (pIA266, left panel) and the T7A1 promoter followed by 29 nt long U-less region that allows formation of the A29 halted complex and wild-type ops signal (pIA237, right panel). Preformed, [ -32P]AMP-labeled A26 or A29 complexes were incubated at 37 C with 50 g/ml heparin, 20 M GTP, and 150 M each ATP, CTP, and UTP in the absence or presence of 0.5 mM ppGpp. Samples were removed at times indicated in seconds above each lane and separated on a 10% denaturing gel. RNA sequencing ladder was generated by incubation of the halted complexes with 25 M NTPs and 25 M of a 3 O-methyl NTP, indicated below each lane. The sequences are shown next to the sequencing ladder. Positions of the ppGpp-enhanced pauses are indicated. The pause at C61 (indicated by a star) is ppGpp-dependent.

between ppGpp and the C residues in the transcription bubble may also be responsible for the reported ppGpp inhibition of elongation (Krohn and Wagner, 1996), we tested ppGpp effect in single-round pause assays on two different templates (Figure 6) and mapped the positions of sites at which ppGpp affected transcription. ppGpp enhanced pausing and arrest at several sites on both templates and significantly increased the efficiency of termination at the rrnB T1 signal. The most dramatic

changes in pause efficiency occurred at positions C61, U73, C76, and C82 on PR template and C40, C62, and C94 on T7A1 template (C82 and C62 residues are present in the identical sequence context). On T7A1 template, ppGpp also induced pausing at a single position (C61, indicated by a star). In contrast to the previous report (Krohn and Wagner, 1996) but consistent with the pausing propensities of RNAP (Aivazashvili et al., 1981), we did not detect ppGpp-enhanced pauses following

the addition of purine residues. Since ppGpp preferentially enhances pausing at C residues, we conclude that base pairing with cytosine at the 1 position likely leads to ppGpp-induced delay in transcript elongation. The observation that ppGpp also enhanced pausing at U73, as well as arrest and termination, suggests that other mechanisms also contribute to the inhibition of transcript elongation. For example, ppGpp may directly inhibit the nucleotide addition reaction through its effects on the active site conformation (see below). The above experiments further validate the proposed model of the open complex in the primary assumption that some alterations of the RNAP structure are required for NT-strand nucleotides to gain access to the ppGpp binding site during both the initiation and elongation phases of transcription. Transcription Regulation by ppGpp In combination with modeling, the structure of the RNAP/ppGpp complex suggests at least three possible modes of transcription regulation by ppGpp. First, the asymmetry in the active site configuration induced by the different modes of the ppGpp binding might play an essential role in determining the outcome of ppGppdependent regulation of transcription. For example, in the 5 orientation, ppGpp may increase the affinity of the active site for the two catalytic Mg2 ions, thereby not affecting or even potentially facilitating substrate binding and catalysis. In contrast, the 3 orientation of ppGpp may disfavor the binding of the second catalytic Mg2 (cMG2), thereby slowing down the reaction. Secondly, competition between ppGpp and the substrate for binding in the active site may provide another mode of regulation. In this mode, competition between ppGpp and substrate phosphates for binding to the same basic residues (e.g., Arg 879), rather than steric hindrance between the phosphates, would be likely. A direct competition between ppGpp and substrate is supported by recent studies (Jores and Wagner, 2003; Wagner, 2002). Finally, ppGpp bound in the 3 orientation might form Watson-Crick base pairs with cytosines in the NT DNA strand and inhibit transcription by slowing down the translocation and/or by disrupting protein-DNA interactions that stabilize the open complex, thereby decreasing its life time. Given the likely restrained orientation of the nucleotide base in the NT DNA strand (Figure 5), the flipping of the ppGpp base from the 3 to the 5 orientation (Figure 1C) would prevent base pairing with the NT strand cytosines. The involvement of accessory protein(s) that may amplify ppGpp effects on transcription likely explains big discrepancies between the modest effects of ppGpp detected in vitro and a dramatic ppGpp-mediated response in vivo. These proteins may provide additional levels of regulation conferred by ppGpp by enhancing recruitment of ppGpp to RNAP, favoring a particular (5 or 3 ) mode of ppGpp binding, etc. We cannot rule out the possibility that RNAP contains another low affinity ppGpp binding site(s) (Chatterji et al., 1998; Toulokhonov et al., 2001) to which ppGpp would bind only in the presence of nucleic acids or accessory proteins, thereby providing additional modes of regulation to those suggested above.

Concluding Remarks We suggest that different modes (or their combinations) of transcription regulation by ppGpp might operate at different promoters, depending on the nucleic acid composition of the promoter and, therefore, on the RNAP conformation in the open complex. This would increase the flexibility of regulation and would allow a single nucleotide to confer different effects on transcription of genes that belong to same (negatively or positively controlled) regulon. This proposal is consistent with at least two sets of experimental results: (1) some genes under positive control exhibit significantly higher rates of transcription in the presence of ppGpp (Choy, 2000; Gentry et al., 1993), whereas other genes from the same category show little increase in transcription (Barker et al., 2001b); and (2) of the two rRNA promoters rrnB and rrnD, which contain three and two cytosines, respectively, in the NT strand from 2 to 2, rrnB exhibits a somewhat higher level of inhibition by ppGpp (Jores and Wagner, 2003), in agreement with the hypothesis that C residues in the NT strand contribute to the inhibition of transcription by ppGpp. In addition to its well-characterized role in the shut down of the superfluous ribosomal RNA synthesis during starvation, ppGpp appears to possess many other regulatory functions. Recent studies suggest that ppGpp also acts as a global transcriptional regulator that allows cells to adapt to changing environmental conditions by favoring the association of the alternative factors with core RNAP (Jishage et al., 2002; Laurie et al., 2003). By altering the holoenzyme population dynamics, ppGpp could differentially modulate the expression of a particular set of genes. The in vivo regulatory effects of ppGpp are not limited to the initiation step of transcription. Accumulation of ppGpp leads to a substantial decrease in the rate of RNA chain elongation (Vogel and Jensen, 1994) and dramatically improves survival of some UV-damaged E. coli strains (McGlynn and Lloyd, 2000). The latter effect could be explained by the ppGpp-induced destabilization of the elongation complexes that would allow release of RNAP stalled at the site of UV damage. A similar mechanism could underlie the ppGpp-dependent increase of termination at rrnB T1 site (Figure 6). All of the pleiotropic cellular activities of ppGpp studied so far depend on its binding to the RNAP. The highresolution structure of the ppGpp-RNAP complex reported here not only allows for reinterpretation of the accumulated biochemical and physiological data within a new structural framework but should stimulate further research through rational design of the both polymerase and template mutants, physical reporter probes, crosslinking agents, etc.
Experimental Procedures Preparation of ppGpp Preparative-scale synthesis of ppGpp was performed using purine nucleotide pyrophosphotransferase (Oki et al., 1975) from Streptomyces morookaensis A-573. The reaction was carried out at 37 C for 1 hr in a final volume of 46 ml containing 12 units of purine nucleotide pyrophosphotransferase, 238 mg of ATP, 213 mg of GDP, 50 mM MgCl2, and 250 mM glycine (pH 10.0). The reaction mixture was subjected to DEAE-sephadex A-25 column chromatography

(3.0 10.0 cm) equilibrated with distilled water. The column was eluted with a 0.2­0.5 M linear gradient of LiCl (600 ml). The ppGppcontaining fractions (130 ml) were collected, filtrated through 0.22 m Millipore MF membrane, and concentrated to about 10 ml under reduced pressure. The ppGpp was precipitated by adding 100 ml of ethanol, washed twice with ethanol and once with acetone, and lyophilized to remove residual water. The yield of ppGpp was 214 mg per 45 ml of the reaction mixture, and the purity was more than 97% as assessed by HPLC analysis. Structure Determination and Refinement T. thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme was purified as described previously (Vassylyeva et al., 2002). Crystals of the RNAP/ppGpp complex were obtained under the same conditions as those of the apoholoenzyme (Vassylyeva et al., 2002), except that the well solution containing 2 mM ppGpp was added to the crystallization drops. Cocrystallization produced crystals that were essentially isomorphous to those of the apoholoenzyme. The crystals belong to the ° same space group, P32 with unit cell parameters a b 236.3 A, ° c 249 A, and contain two RNAP molecules in the asymmetric unit. The data were collected at the SPring-8 beam line BL45 using ° RAXIS-V as a detector and were processed at 2.7 A resolution using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) (Table 1). The initial model of the RNAP (Vassylyev et al., 2002) ° provided an Rfree of 37.4% at 2.7 A resolution. Several rounds of the rigid body refinement followed by positional and B factor refinements using the CNS program (Brunger et al., 1998) yielded an Rfree ° of 30.8% (R factor 27.0%) at 2.7 A resolution. Several rounds of the water pick and water delete procedures (Brunger et al., 1998) alternating with positional refinement (Brunger et al., 1998) and manual inspection (Jones et al., 1991) were carried out. Using the model phases at this stage, a difference Fourier map was produced using ° |FppGpp Fnati| as coefficients at the 3.0 A resolution (FppGpp and Fnati are the structure factors of the RNAP/ppGpp complex and apoholoenzyme, respectively). This map provided unambiguous ED, into which ppGpp was modeled for both RNAP molecules using the O program (Jones et al., 1991) (Supplemental Figure S1). All the procedures described above were carried out from the beginning in a presence of ppGpp coordinates to result in a final model (Figures 1A and 1B, Table 1). Figures 2A and 5A were prepared using the SWISS-PDB Viewer program (Kaplan and Littlejohn, 2001). Other structural figures were drawn using the MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1999), and Raster3D (Merrit and Bacon, 1997) programs. Sources of Proteins, Oligonucleotides, and Reagents All general reagents were obtained from Sigma, DNA restriction and modification enzymes from NEB, Taq DNA polymerase from GIBCO BRL, dNTPs from USB, and NTPs from Amersham Biosciences. T. thermophilus RNAP was purified as described previously. Wild-type and N458S E. coli RNAPs were overexpressed in pIA299 background by a combination of Ni-NTA, heparin, and monoQ chromatography as described previously. Construction and characterization N458S E. coli RNAP will be described elsewhere. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. 3 O-methyl NTPs were from TriLink Biotechnologies. In Vitro Transcription Assays Linear DNA templates for in vitro transcription were generated by PCR amplification of the plasmids listed in figure legends and purified using PCR purification kit (Qiagen). For PR assays, mutations at the 1 position were introduced into the PCR primers, which also included 35 bp of DNA downstream from the transcription start site. DNA template (40 nM) was incubated with 50 nM of RNAP holoenzyme for 10 min at 37 C (for E. coli) or 55 C (for T. thermophilus) in 50 l transcription buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA [pH 7.9]). When added, ppGpp was present at 0.5 mM. For open complex longevity assays, heparin was added to 14 g/ml to sequester any free RNAP. Reaction aliquots were withdrawn at various times (prior to heparin addition at time 0) and combined with nucleotide substrates (100 M ApU, 2 M CTP, and 10 Ci of [ 32P]-CTP [3000 Ci/mmol]). For E. coli RNAP open complex stability assays, NaCl was added to

200 mM prior to heparin. For run-off assays, all for NTPs (at 20 M), 100 M ApU, and 10 Ci of [ 32P]-CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were added. Following 11 min incubation at the appropriate temperature for each enzyme, reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of STOP buffer (10 M urea, 20 mM EDTA, 45 mM Tris-borate [pH 8.3]). For pause assays, halted elongation complexes were formed during 15 min incubation of 40 nM DNA template (pIA266 or pIA237) (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000, 2002) and 50 nM E. coli RNAP holoenzyme at 37 C in 50 l of TB, with ApU at 150 M; ATP, GTP, and CTP at 2.5 M (for 237); or ATP, GTP, and UTP at 2.5 M (for pIA266) with 32P derived from [ 32P]-GTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Samples were heated for 2 min at 90 C and separated by electrophoresis in denaturing acrylamide gels (19:1) (7 M urea, 0.5 X TBE). RNA products were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimaging System and ImageQuant Software. Acknowledgments We thank Drs. R. Gourse, V.J. Hernandez, W.T. McAllister, and V.
