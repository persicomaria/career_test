ABSTRACT: The C-terminal module of the thermostable Thermotoga maritima xylanase 10A (CBM9-2) is a family 9 carbohydrate-binding module that binds to amorphous and crystalline cellulose and a range of soluble di- and monosaccharides as well as to cello and xylo oligomers of different degrees of polymerization [Boraston, A. B., Creagh, A. L., Alam, Md. M., Kormos, J. M., Tomme, P., Haynes, C. A., Warren, R. A. J., and Kilburn, D. G. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 6240-6247]. The crystal structure of CBM9-2 has been determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method to 1.9 Å resolution. CBM9-2 assumes a -sandwich fold and contains three metal binding sites. The bound metal atoms, which are most likely calcium cations, are in an octahedral coordination. The crystal structures of CBM9-2 in complex with glucose and cellobiose were also determined in order to identify the sugar-binding site and provide insight into the structural basis for sugar binding by CBM9-2. The sugar-binding site is a solvent-exposed slot sufficient in depth, width, and length to accommodate a disaccharide. Two tryptophan residues are stacked together on the surface of the protein forming the sugar-binding site. From the complex structures with glucose and cellobiose, it was inferred that CBM9-2 binds exclusively to the reducing end of mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides with an intricate hydrogen-bonding network involving mainly charged residues, as well as stacking interactions by Trp175 and Trp71. The binding interactions are limited to disaccharides as was expected from calorimetric data. Comparison of the glucose and cellobiose complexes revealed surprising differences in binding of these two substrates by CBM9-2. Cellobiose was found to bind in a distinct orientation from glucose, while still maintaining optimal stacking and electrostatic interactions with the reducing end sugar.

Microbial degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose found in plant biomass is achieved by the activity of diverse polysaccharolytic enzyme systems (2, 3). The majority of polysaccharidases produced by cellulolytic organisms have modular structures comprising a catalytic module and one or more ancillary modules (4). The most common type of ancillary module is the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM),1 some of which were previously called cellulose-binding domains (3). In many cases the presence of the CBM enhances the hydrolytic activity of an enzyme. It is thought

to do so by increasing the concentration of the enzyme on the substrate (5), though there is some evidence for nonhydrolytic disruption of cellulose by a CBM (6). Structural studies of CBMs have allowed insights into the mechanisms of substrate binding. The binding sites of the CBMs for which structures have been determined are of two general types: flat surfaces comprising predominantly aromatic residues and extended shallow grooves. The family 1 CBMs from Trichoderma reesei (7, 8), the family 2a CBM from xylanase 10A of Cellulomonas fimi (9), the family 3 CBM from CipC of Clostridium thermocellum (10), the family 5 CBM from cellulase 5A of Erwinia crysanthemi (11), and the family 10 CBM from Pseudomonas fluorescens xylanase 10A (12) are all -sheet polypeptides. The binding faces of CBMs from these families, identified by site-directed mutagenesis (13-18), are flat faces and composed mainly of tryptophan and tyrosine residues. The ligand of these CBMs, crystalline cellulose, is a regular array of cellulose chains with a staircase organization (19). The binding faces of these examples of family 1, 2a, 3, and 5 CBMs seem well suited to bind the flat surfaces of cellulose crystals. In the case of CBM2a, thermodynamic data have suggested that dehydration of the aromatic binding face provides an entropic driving force for binding (20). Beyond

Structure of Family 9 Carbohydrate-Binding Module this, other protein-cellulose interactions are speculative at best. The tandem N-terminal family 4 CBMs (CBM4-1 and CBM4-2) from cellulase 9B of C. fimi (21) and the internal family 2b CBM (CBM2b-1) from xylanase 11b of C. fimi (22) bind soluble -1,4-glucan and -1,4-xylan chains, respectively. The binding sites of these CBMs, identified by NMR spectroscopy, are shallow grooves sufficient in width and length to accommodate individual glycan chains up to five sugar units in length (but no smaller than three). As with most carbohydrate-binding proteins, the involvement of aromatic residues in ligand binding is implicated; however, in contrast to CBM2a, thermodynamic studies of CBM4-1 and CBM2b-1 implied a predominance of polar and van der Waals interactions with the ligand (22, 23). The crystal structure of the family 22 CBM from C. thermocellum xylanase 10B also revealed a shallow cleft, lined with tryptophan and tyrosine residues, long enough to accommodate up to four sugar moieties (24). The C-terminal family 9 CBM (CBM9-2) from xylanase 10A of Thermotoga maritima is an extremely thermostable module (25) with the unique ability to bind tightly to crystalline cellulose, amorphous cellulose, and disaccharides (1). The thermostability and unprecedented capacity to bind all cellulose allomorphs, in addition to many types of small soluble sugars, make it an interesting candidate for structural studies. Here the crystal structure of CBM9-2 in native and ligand-bound forms to 1.9 Å resolution is described. For the first time we can describe the specific intermolecular contacts that mediate the binding of a CBM with its ligand. The accompanying paper characterizes the binding of this CBM. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. All chemicals and buffer reagents used were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified. Cellotetraose was from Megazyme (Dublin, Ireland, U.K.). Bacterial Strains and Plasmid. T. maritima CBM9-2 (1) was produced in Escherichia coli strains JM101 or the BL21derived B834(DE3) for selenomethionine incorporation (Novagen, Madison, WI). The plasmid used was pET28a (Novagen, Milwaukee, MI). Media and Growth Conditions. E. coli cultures were grown routinely in TB or TYP medium (26) unless otherwise stated at 37 °C or at 30 °C for production of protein. The medium contained 50 mg L-1 kanamycin of culture for strains carrying pET28 plasmids. Production and Purification of Selenomethionine Containing CBM9-2. Unlabeled CBM9-2 was produced and purified as described previously (1). The pET28a plasmid containing the CBM9-2 construct was transformed into competent E. coli B834(DE3) methionine auxotrophs by heat shock. A 15 mL culture was grown on enriched minimal medium (2× M9 salts supplemented with all regular amino acids to 40 mg/L, vitamins, riboflavin, niacinamide, pyridoxine monohydrochloride, and thiamin to 1 mg/L, 0.4% glucose, 25 mg/L FeSO4, and 2 mM MgSO4) overnight at 37 °C with 50 mg/L kanamycin. Then 5 mL of this culture was added to 1 L of medium as above, with methionine substituted by seleno-L-methionine at 100 mg L-1, and allowed to grow to an OD600 of 0.7. If the doubling time was found to be longer

Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 21, 2001 6249 than 2 h, then an additional 1 mL of a 65:35 selenomethionine:methionine culture in stationary phase was added. IPTG was added to 0.3 mM to induce protein production, and cells were harvested after 5 h by centrifugation. CBM9-2 was purified as described previously (1) and stored at 30 mg mL-1 at 4 °C. The final selenomethionine protein yield from this 1 L culture was approximately 80 mg. Crystallization of NatiVe and DeriVatiVe CBM9-2. Tetragonal crystals were grown using the vapor diffusion technique from hanging and sitting drops in 15% PEG 8000 and 0.2 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5. Long thin needle crystals generally appeared immediately upon mixing the protein and reservoir solutions if either the protein concentration or the PEG concentration was too high. Optimized precipitant and protein concentration combinations did produce three-dimensional crystals that appeared after 1 week or more at room temperatures, with dimensions reaching 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.5-1.5 mm. The crystals are of space group P41212 with cell dimensions a ) b ) 56.8 Å and c ) 123.1 Å, allowing for 1 molecule per asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 43%. The selenomethionine-substituted protein crystallized under conditions identical to those of the wildtype protein. Crystals of CBM9-2 complexed with glucose and cellobiose were produced by supplementing the reservoir solution with 50-100 mM substrate and adjusting precipitant concentrations. Data Collection and Processing. Prior to data collection crystals were bathed in artificial mother liquor with 30% glycerol added as cryoprotectant and quickly frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K in a rayon fiber loop. Data sets from a native and selenomethionine-labeled crystal were collected in-house on a Mar345 image plate using Osmic mirror focused Cu KR X-rays, generated from a rotating anode operating at 100 mA × 50 kV. A total of 90 oscillations of 1° were collected in 5 min exposures. All data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the Denzo/ Scalepack package (27). Two peaks could be visualized on a difference Patterson map calculated in the program PHASES at this point (28), which suggested that there was significant incorporation of selenium atoms in the protein crystals (not shown). Subsequently, a three-wavelength MAD data set was collected at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratories at the BioCARS 14-BMD, on a 1K CCD area detector at 105 mm crystal to detector distance. The absorption edge for selenium was detected by scanning through the theoretical X-ray absorption edge. Three wavelengths were chosen, one at the inflection point or edge of the absorption profile (f -min,  ) 0.9799 Å), one at its peak (f -max,  ) 0.9797 Å), and one reference set at a remote wavelength ( ) 0.9537 Å). Data sets were collected to 1.8 Å resolution, and the program package Denzo/ Scalepack was used to refine experimental parameters and process data (27). In addition, glucose and cellobiose complexes were crystallized and data collected in-house as described above. Experimental statistics are summarized in Table 1. Determination of Selenium Atom Positions and Phasing. Initially, the program Solve was used in an attempt to locate directly the three expected selenium atoms from the MAD data set alone (29). Both possible enantiomorphic space groups were tested, but none of the sites were found. Using the home data sets collected from native and SeMet crystals,

a combined MAD/MIR routine was attempted by treating the home data set pair as an additional isomorphous heavy atom system. This approach yielded two selenium sites with occupancies of 0.63 and 0.38; the third expected site located at the N-terminus remained elusive and was presumed disordered. The phases calculated from these two positions and intensities to 1.8 Å from the home selenomethionine data set resulted in the modest average figure of merit of 0.42. Density modification using DM in the program suite CCP4 (30, 31), implementing histogram matching and solvent flattening, was used to improve the map quality. The resulting map based on 43% solvent content was of sufficient quality to be completely traced, except for some loop regions. Interestingly, no density beyond C- was seen in this experimental map for each of the selenomethionine residues, both of which are located on the surface of the protein and were later found to assume multiple conformations. Model Building and Refinement. The initial solventflattened map was manually traced using the graphical interface in O (32). Most regions in the electron density were reasonably well defined, with distinct carbonyl oxygens and recognizable side chains in most cases, except for the two methionine residues and some disordered solvent-exposed residues. Three loop regions seemed poorly defined upon

first inspection and were omitted from the polypeptide trace. Closer inspection, however, revealed that these loops included unanticipated octahedrally coordinated metal binding sites and were, in fact, well ordered. A total of 188 residues were fitted, as well as three metal ions, which were initially treated as water molecules because their identity was unknown. This model underwent rigid body refinement in the program CNS (33), implementing bulk solvent correction and a maximum likelihood refinement target using structure factor amplitudes, against the 1.9 Å wild-type data collected in-house with a random 10% of reflections set aside for crossvalidation purposes (33, 34). Visual inspection of 2|Fo| |Fc| (1) and |Fo| - |Fc| (+3, -3) electron density with calculated model phases allowed for some manual adjustments of poorly fitted regions. The three metal ions were assumed to be Ca2+ cations from here on, based on the

octahedral geometry of the coordination and the size of the difference peaks (35). The observation that exclusively oxygen atoms were found to coordinate the metal ions at a distance of 2.3-2.7 Å strongly supports this contention. In addition, there is precedence of Ca2+ ions present in thermally stable proteins in general (35, 36) and CBMs in particular (10, 24, 37). At this stage, the model was subjected to simulated annealing starting from 3000 K in steps of 25 K, followed by positional refinement and grouped thermal parameter refinement. Several cycles of manual water building were performed at this point. Upon convergence of R-free, individual B-factors were refined. Structures of the cellobiose and glucose complexed proteins were determined by molecular replacement of the unliganded model (without water molecules) against the diffraction data of the complexed crystals. The substrate was located and built into 3 |Fo| |Fc| difference density, and these coordinates were included in the model. This model then was refined as described above, except simulated annealing was commenced at 1500 K.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of CBM9-2. The native protein model consists of 1484 non-hydrogen atoms, 3 calcium atoms, and 154 ordered water molecules. Structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. A ribbon diagram of the crystal structure (of the cellobiosebound form) and a topology representation are shown in Figure 1. The three-dimensional structure consists of two twisted antiparallel -sheets each made up of five -strands ( 2- 3- 4- 9- 8 and 7-- 6- 5- 10- 11) to form a -sandwich fold, flanked by an additional two-stranded parallel -sheet ( 1- 12) comprising the N- and C-termini. A short R-helix starts off a loop connecting 1 and 2, which is stabilized by a Ca2+ ion. Two other Ca2+ ions are also found at the periphery of the protein, one stabilizing a loop connecting strands 5 and 6 and one sandwiched between 3 and 4. This last site also forms contacts with 10 and 11, thus connecting the two -sheets. The coordination of this site and the two other Ca2+ sites, depicted in Figure 2, exhibits close to perfect octahedral geometry, and all involve oxygens originating from a combination of main-chain

carbonyls, waters and side-chain carbonyls. Several sidechain carbonyls [Glu130 in (a), Asp93 and 94 in (b), and Asp74 and Asp60 in (c)] appear to form interactions with the calcium ion through their deprotonated resonance form, with the negative charge distributed over both oxygens. None of the calcium sites is in direct contact with the binding site, suggesting that the observed calcium binding sites most likely serve a structural role, stabilizing the three-dimensional organization of the polypeptide thereby contributing to the thermostability of the protein. CBM9-2 has been shown to bind amorphous and crystalline cellulose, xylan, and a range of small soluble sugars including mono- and disaccharides and cello- and xylooligosaccharides. Cellobiose bound with the highest affinity of the substrates tested, and cellooligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization greater than 2 did not bind with higher affinity, suggesting that a disaccharide might fully occupy the binding region (1). Two tryptophan residues, Trp175 and Trp71, were found in parallel orientation at the base of the second twisted -sheet such that both residues could interact with a carbohydrate placed between these residues. The stacking of aromatic amino acid side chains against the apolar surfaces of carbohydrates is common in protein-carbohydrate interactions. For this reason, and the prevalence of planar polar amino acids at the base of the cleft formed by these tryptophans, this was predicted to constitute the binding region of CBM9-2. Structure of CBM9-2 in Complex with Saccharides. The native protein model was used in rigid body refinement against data of the cellobiose-CBM9-2 cocrystallized com-

plex to optimize the orientation of the model in the unit cell. Difference electron density from |Fo| - |Fc| and 2|Fo| |Fc| (contoured at 3 and 1, respectively) clearly revealed a single cellobiose molecule sandwiched between Trp71 and Trp175 as anticipated (Figure 3a). A cellobiose molecule was easily fitted into the density in a single orientation, with the reducing end of the sugar pointed into the protein. An extensive network of hydrogen-bonding interactions involving all hydroxyl groups and the cyclic oxygen is formed around the reducing end (proximal) sugar. Of particular interest are interactions formed with the OH1 and OH2 groups of the reducing sugar. Binding experiments have shown that substrates with modified functional groups at these positions (such as 1-O-methylglucopyranosides, GlcNAc, or mannose) (1) are unable to compete with cellulose for binding to CBM9-2, suggesting that interactions at these positions are extremely important. Indeed, the anomeric hydroxyl group (OH1) forms three hydrogen bonds with Asn172, Arg161, and Gln151; OH2 also forms two interactions, with Glu77 and an ordered water molecule, which is traced back to the cyclic nitrogen of Trp175. A schematic representation of interactions between cellobiose and CBM9-2 is shown in Figure 4a. The tryptophan residues provide planar hydrophobic stacking interactions spanning the whole disaccharide, centering on the glycosidic bond and seemingly involving both sugar rings equally. The nonreducing or distal saccharide receives fewer hydrogen bonds from the protein than the proximal sugar; its OH6 hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond with Arg98.

FIGURE 5: Stereo representation of the binding site interactions in CBM9-2 with cellobiose (yellow) and glucose (green). Only the hydrogenbonding interactions with cellobiose are shown, for clarity (see Figure 4 for glucose interactions).

Calorimetric analysis of binding indicated that glucose may undergo a different mechanism of binding compared to the disaccharides tested (1). Thus it was of interest to investigate the crystal structure of CBM9-2 in complex with glucose. The structure was acquired as described above. Again, difference electron density using the unbound structure as a starting model clearly revealed a glucose moiety bound in the binding pocket of the protein, allowing for straightforward building of the sugar into the structure (Figure 3b). Surprisingly, glucose is bound in the pocket in a markedly different orientation from cellobiose. Although the reducing end of the sugar remains oriented inward, none of the specific hydrogen-bonding interactions is maintained, but they are replaced by a set of new interactions (Figure 4b). Roughly, the glucose molecule, compared to the proximal ring of cellobiose, has rotated 180° around the axis defined by C1C4 and an additional 60° in the plane of the ring. This not only maintains proper stacking interactions with the Trp "sandwich" but allows for a crude overlap of functional groups in space, and therefore an almost equal number of hydrogen bonds are formed with the protein as seen with cellobiose (Figure 5). Interestingly, OH1 and OH2 in glucose

The binding region resembles a blind canyon which can accommodate two units from one end of a polysaccharide chain. Internal units from a polysaccharide chain are not able to bind in such a pocket.

overlap almost perfectly with OH2 and OH1 of cellobiose, respectively, supporting the importance of these two hydroxyl

groups as discussed above, but not in the conserved fashion that was anticipated.

Structure of Family 9 Carbohydrate-Binding Module On the assumption that only one of the above modes of binding corresponds to that of "natural" substrates, we investigated two larger saccharides, cellotetraose and xylopentose, in complex with CBM9-2 in the crystal. In both of these structures, only the first two sugars had visible electron density, in agreement with the thermodynamic data indicating that all the essential interactions were made by the two reducing end sugars (1). The mode of binding of the proximal sugar was exactly that seen in the glucose structure described above, with all of the interactions shown in Figure 4b maintained (except where the C6 substituent is absent in xylose), suggesting that the glucose, rather than the cellobiose, orientation was the normal binding mode. The second, distal sugar in both of the polysaccharide structures forms the same Trp stacking interaction seen in the cellobiose structure. It is not clear why cellobiose forms an anomalous interaction with the binding site at the proximal sugar position. Interestingly, the second sugar unit of xylopentaose was rotated 180° about the glycosidic bond relative to the first, rather than the expected 120° found in xylan chains (38). The G of xylobiose relative to xylose was 2.5 kJ/mol less favorable than the G of cellobiose relative to glucose (1). The reduced energetic contribution of the second sugar in xylobiose may result from the additional energetic cost of imposing conformation on the glycosidic bond of the xylooligosaccharide. CBM9-2 Binds to the Reducing Ends of Carbohydrates. The results presented here demonstrate that CBM9-2 recognizes the reducing ends of small carbohydrates. It has also been shown that altering the reducing ends of polysaccharides by NaBH4 reduction destroys the binding of CBM9-2 to these polysaccharides (1). The shape of the CBM9-2 binding site reveals the structural basis of this specificity. The carbohydratebinding site of CBM9-2 can be described as a "blind canyon", a groove in the protein surface that is blocked at one end (Figure 6). The reducing ends of small sugars point into the blocked end of this canyon and make several hydrogen bonds with the protein. Such a conformation cannot accommodate binding internally on a polysaccharide chain or to side chains where the reducing ends of the sugars are involved in the glycosidic linkages. Tandem Family 9 Carbohydrate-Binding Modules. Family 9 of carbohydrate-binding modules contains approximately 19 putative CBM sequences from 11 organisms (Figure 7) (39). These sequences frequently occur as tandems in polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, particularly in the thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms. T. maritima xylanase 10A contains such a tandem repeat of family 9 CBMs. To further elucidate the function of this doublet, we have investigated the binding properties of the first family 9 CBM in xylanase 10A from T. maritima, CBM9-1, and the tandem of both family 9 CBMs, CBM9-1.2. CBM9-1 did not bind in an affinity electrophoresis assay to any of the polysaccharides tested (barley -glucan, birchwood xylan, pectic galactan, xyloglucan, or arabinoxylan) nor did it bind to phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose, or insoluble oat spelt xylan. The affinity of CBM9-1.2 for barley -glucan, PASA, and cellooligosaccharides was unchanged relative to CBM9-2 (results not shown). This indicates that CBM9-1 does not have any obvious binding function either alone or in the context of the second binding module. The lack of binding

Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 21, 2001 6255 activity of CBM9-1 may be explained by the lack of conservation of most residues that interact with ligand in CBM9-2 (Figure 7). Particularly noticeable is the absence of the two aromatic residues involved in "sandwiching" the sugar. Generation of a structural model (40) of CBM9-1 using CBM9-2 as a template implies that there is no binding cleft (not shown). We propose that carbohydrate-binding module family 9 contains two subfamilies: 9a and 9b. Family 9a, which includes CBM9-1, comprises the N-terminal modules of tandem family 9 modules. Members of family 9a are easily identified by deletions in loop regions between -sheets 4 and 5, a loop making up part of the CBM9-2 binding site, and between -sheets 7 and 8 of CBM9-2 (Figure 7). The similarity of CBM9-1 to the other family 9a modules suggests a comparable lack of carbohydrate-binding function throughout this subfamily. Some members of CBM family 22 found in thermophilic xylanases have been shown to protect the catalytic module from thermal inactivation (41-43). This family has recently been shown to comprise xylan-binding modules but, similar to family 9, also contains modules with no apparent binding function (24, 44, 45). It is possible that CBM9-1 has a similar thermostabilizing effect. However, no thermostabilizing role has been unequivocally demonstrated as the sole function for any ancillary module. Thus, one cannot ignore alternatives such as the potential importance of the spacing between the catalytic module and CBM9-2 imposed by CBM9-1; CBM9-1 may perform the role of a linker. Family 9b, which includes CBM9-2, comprises the Cterminal modules of tandem family 9 modules and the family 9 modules that appear alone. The conservation of structural components (residues found in the secondary structure and metal binding sites) and functional components (residues involved in substrate binding) of this subfamily suggests that structure and carbohydrate-binding function is also relatively well conserved among these modules.
