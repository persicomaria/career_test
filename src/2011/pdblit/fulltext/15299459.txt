The production of IRAP crystals in support of the structure determination effort presented several challenges. In our experience, protein solutions fail to produce crystals after about six weeks even though these solutions are maintained at 277 K. Furthermore, crystals left in droplets gradually lose the ability to diffract X-rays over a period of about two months. Finally, no artificial preservation solution was found with which to mount crystals for X-ray diffraction, to harvest and preserve crystals, or to use for making heavy-atom soak solutions. Mounting solutions were prepared by harvesting spent droplets that had produced crystals, centrifuging the harvested mixtures, and using the supernatants in 5-10 txl aliquots. A microscale procedure was developed for preparation of heavy-atom derivatives for multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) applications. This procedure does not involve transferring crystals

between solutions and does not require a special preservation solution. First, a heavy-atom reagent solution, approximately four times more concentrated than the desired initial soak concentration, is prepared in precipitant solution similar in composition to the well solution, and a crystal still in its original droplet is selected as the target for a heavyatom soak equipment. The coverslip supporting the droplet with the target crystal is then removed from its well and equal-sized aliquots of the heavy-atom reagent and protein solution are quickly superposed on the coverslip to make a second droplet next to, but not touching, the droplet with the target crystal. The coverslip with the pair of droplets is then quickly replaced over the well to allow the new droplet to equilibrate against the well solution. After 24-48 h, the new droplet is joined to the droplet with the crystal by drawing the former into the latter with a needle. In the procedure described here, the volume

L. L. C L A N C Y et of the new droplet is made equal to the original volume of the droplet with the target crystal when the latter was first made, but similar procedures involving other proportioning schemes may be devised. Several data sets, including the first to specify diffraction symmetry and unit-cell dimensions, were collected at 277 K at the single-crystal diffraction facility of the Biology Department of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). Early data-collection attempts served to alert us to problems with nonisomorphism (or perhaps polymorphism) in IRAP crystals. The unit-cell c axis length was observed to vary from crystal to crystal, ranging from 106 to 120 A, though diffracted intensities sometimes varied unexpectedly even in crystals with nearly identical cell constants. Crystalline specimens grown from different protein preparations showed the largest variations, but in at least one instance, large differences also were shown to arise from the same crystal over a period of several weeks. All data eventually used in the structure solution were collected from a crop of crystals derived from a single batch of protein. Further analysis of this problem is postponed until completion of the refinement of this initial structure. All diffraction data used in structure solution were collected at room temperature. Crystals were mounted at 277 K and allowed to warm in stryofoam containers over a period of 2 h, because of apparent sensitivities to rapid warming. A Siemens imaging proportional counter mounted on the 20 arm of a P3F four-circle goniostat was used to collect X-ray diffraction data. A Siemens rotating anode X-ray source, operated at 90 mA, 50 kV and equipped with a graphite monochromator, provided Cu K a radiation. For most data-collection purposes, the detector was placed 15 cm from the crystal with the normal to the detector face at an angle of 20 ° to the incident X-ray beam, so that data from 80 to 2.3 A resolution were intercepted by the detector face. Data were collected in discrete 0.25 ° rotational scans about the o~ axis at goniostat X settings of both 0 and 90:. Reduction of raw data to integrated intensities was performed with the X E N G E N software package (Howard et al., 1987). Each data set was collected from a single crystal over a period of 2-3 d. A summary of data required for the structure solution is given in Table 1. Unit-cell dimensions for this batch of crystals are a = b = 72.35 (26) A, c = 114.7 (8) A. Diffraction symmetries and systematic absences ( 4 / m m m ; 00/: l ;~ 4n, h000: h * 2n) specify the pair of tetragonal enantiomorphic space groups P4,212 or P432,2.

models derived from either I L - l a or IL-I/3 were unsuccessful, perhaps due to the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Two heavy-atom derivatives were useful in the calculation of phases, a potassium gold cyanide derivative and trimethyl lead chloride derivative. Conditions for producing these derivatives and summaries of diffraction data collected from two crystals of each are given in Table 1. Heavy-atom binding sites were identified with the aid of the Patterson analysis program H A S S P (Terwilliger, Kim & Eisenberg, 1987). Heavy atoms from both derivatives

Anomalousdifference Patterson maps computed from the two other sets of data from these derivatives lacked these consistent features, and anomalous differences from those data sets were not used in phase calculations. Maps were calculated and contoured with the aid of programs in the XtalView software package (McCree, 1992).

appear to occupy the same single site. Only two derivative data sets (designated Au II and Pb II) gave rise to peaks in anomalous-difference Patterson maps consistent with those observed from isomorphous differences (Fig. 1). Anomalous differences from the other two data sets (Au I and Pb I) were not used for phasing, though isomorphous differences from all four derivative data sets were included. Phases were computed by the method and programs of Terwilliger & Eisenberg (1983), and then modified by application of solvent-flattening techniques (Wang, 1985). All phase calculations were carried out in parallel for the two enantiomorphic space groups. The correct choice between enantiomorphs was resolved upon visual inspection of the densitymodified maps: only the map computed under symmetry specified by space group P432~2 showed large regions of interpretable density consistent with the expected size and shape of an IL-l-like molecule. Final heavy-atom parameters are given in Table 2. While all heavy-atom position refinement was carried out to a limit of 3.2/~ resolution, maps computed with data to only 4.0 A were significantly easier to interpret. Maps were displayed on an Evans & Sutherland PS390 graphics terminal with the program F R O D O (Jones, 1985; Pflugrath, Saper & Quiocho, 1984), and a model was constructed. The polypeptide chains for both molecules in the asymmetric unit were easily traced from residue 8 to the

Fig. 2. A Ramachandran plot of backbone ~p, ~b torsion angles for each residue in the IRAP model. The squares denote angles in glycine residues; + symbols represent non-glycine residues; Only two residues (Arg26 and Prol07) lie significantly outside regions of low energy. These residues lie in external loops where the electron density is difficult to interpret unambiguously. The model in these regions is therefore suspect.

Each illustration traces the course of a polypeptide chain, with /3-strand positions and directions indicated with broad arrows. The left view is down the axis of the six-stranded fl-barrel (shaded darker and in front). In the right view the barrel axis is rotated to lie in the plane of the page. These illustrations were made with the M O L S C R I P T programs (Kraulis, 1991).

L. L. C L A N C Y et structural class. Secondary structure assignments extracted from our model agree closely with those observed by N M R for IRAP in solution (Stockman et al., 1992). 12 fl-strands characteristic of molecules that share this architecture are found as arranged in IL-lfl, with six strands distributed around one end of a six-stranded fl-barrel. Loops between strands dominate the molecular surface. IRAP and IL-lfl are most different on one hemispheric face of the molecule. Loops joining strands f14 to f15, f17 to f18, and/311 to /312 in IL-1/3 (as described in Finzel et al., 1989) adopt distinctly different conformations in IRAP, and all these loops fall onto one face of the molecule. Other loops (those joining strands /32 to /33, /33 to /34, and /35 to /36) show only small differences, while the remainder of the loops and the exposed portion of the/3-barrel are nearly identical to IL-1/3 in backbone conformation. The backbone conformation of some, but not all, of the region of I1-1/3 that bears the site proposed to bind to IL-1 receptors (Labriola-Tomkins et al., 1991) is conservatively replicated in IRAP, and this is equally true for IL-la. On the other hand, none of the amino acids in positions suggested as crucial to receptorbinding efficacy in IL-lfl are conserved among all three IL-1 ligand molecules.
