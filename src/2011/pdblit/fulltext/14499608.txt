Introduction

Methanopyrus kandleri is a hyperthermophilic archaeon growing optimally at 98° on H2 and CO2 with the formation of CH4J '2 The organism belonging to the kingdom of Euryarchaeota is the most thermophilic methanogen known so far and is phylogenetically only distantly related to all other known methanogens. 3'4 A characteristic feature of the organism is a relatively high intracellular concentration of cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and potassium ions (>1 M). The pathway of CO2 reduction to CH4 in M. kandleri has been shown to be identical to that used in all other methanogens. 5'6 It involves six tetrahydromethanopterin-specific enzymes. Tetrahydromethanopterin (HaMPT) is a tetrahydrofolate analog (Fig. I). The six H4MPT-specific enzymes catalyze the following reactions:

MFR is the abbreviation for methanofuran, formyl-MFR for N-formylMFR, formyl-H4MPT for NS-formyl-HaMPT, methenyl-HaMPT + for NS,Nl°-methenyl-HaMPT +, methylene-HaMPT for NS,Nl°-methylene HaMPT, methyl-H4MPT for NS-methyl-HnMPT, F420 for coenzyme F420, and H-S-CoM for coenzyme M. Reaction (1) is catalyzed by formylmethanofuran-tetrahydromethanopterin N-formyltransferase (Ftr) (EC 2.3.1.101), reaction (2) by NS,N 10_ methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase (Mch) (EC 3.5.4.27), reaction (3) by F420-dependent N5,Nl°-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Mtd) (EC 1.5.99.9), reaction (4) by H2-forming NS,N l°methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Hmd) (EC 1.12.99.-), reaction (5) by F420-dependent N5,Nl°-methylenetetrahydromethanopt erin reductase (Mer) (EC 1.5.99.-), and reaction (6) by NS-methyltetrahy dromethanopterin : coenzyme M methyltransferase (MtrA-H) (EC 2.1.1.86). Of these enzymes from M. kandleri, only the methyltransferase has not yet been characterized biochemically. This article describes the purification, assay, and properties of the five characterized HaMPT-specific enzymes from M. kandleri. It also provides a description of the isolation of the coenzymes required to assay these enzymes.

Oxygen Sensitivity of Enzymes and Coenzymes The tetrahydromethanopterin-specific enzymes from M. kandleri, at least when present in the cell extract and the coenzyme tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT), are inactivated under oxic conditions. Therefore, purification and assay of the enzymes must be performed under strictly anaerobic conditions. Many of the purification steps are best performed in an anaerobic chamber. The anaerobic chambers used in our laboratory are

FIG. l. Structures of tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) and of tetrahydrofolate (H4F). Functionally, the most important difference between H4MPT and H4F is that H4MPT is an electron-donating methylene group in conjugation to N 1° via the aromatic ring, whereas H4F has an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group in this position. One consequence is that the redox potential of the methenyl-H4MPT/methylene-H4MPT couple (-390 mV) is almost 100 mV more negative than that of the methenyl-I-LF/methylene-H4F couple (-300 mV) and that the redox potential of the methylene-H4MPT/methyl-H4MPT couple (-320 mV) is by 120 mV more negative than that of the methylene-H4F/methyl-H4F couple (-200 mV). The H4MPT derivative found in M. kandleri lacks the methyl group at C7. From R. K. Thauer. A. R. Klein, and G. C. Hartmann, Chem. Rev. 96, 3031 (1996); J. Vorholt and R. K.

available commercially from Coy Laboratory Products Inc. (Grass Lake, MI). The gas phase in the chamber is 95% N2 and 5% H2 (v/v). Traces of oxygen are removed continuously via a palladium catalyst (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany). The chambers are in a room kept at 18°. FPLC (fast protein liquid chromatography) columns and buffers used to separate proteins in the chambers therefore generally have a temperature of 18° except when otherwise stated. Centrifugation steps are generally performed outside the anaerobic chambers at 4 ° using centrifuging tubes, which can be tightly sealed. Photometric assays under anoxic conditions are performed in our laboratory in 1.5-ml quartz cuvettes, which can be closed with a rubber stopper and thus made anaerobic by repeated evacuating and refilling with either 100% N2 or 100% H2 via a needle. At temperatures above 65 ° the cuvettes tend to crack. This is why the activity of the enzymes from M. kandleri are routinely performed at 65 ° rather than at 98°, the growth temperature optimum of M. kandleri. A t 98 ° the specific activity of the enzymes is almost a factor of 2 higher than at 65°. H4MPT, Methenyl-H4MPT, MFR, and F420 Tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT), NS,Nl°-methenyltetrahydrometh anopterin (methenyl-H4MPT+), methanofuran (MFR), and coenzyme F420 are best isolated from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (strain Marburg), which is relatively easy to grow in 100-g (wet mass) amounts and which contains relatively high concentrations of these compounds. The isolation procedure recommended is a modification of that described by Breitung et al. 7 It differs from procedures published previously by other laboratories in that it yields the coenzymes in sufficiently pure form without involving high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).8-16 It has been

used in our laboratory for now more than 5 years and yields highly reproducible results. The procedure is based on the finding that H4MPT, methenylHaMPT, and MFR almost quantitatively and F420 partially (approximately 25%) leak out of M. thermoautotrophicum when the cells are permeabilized with 1% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) at 60° and that the three coenzymes in the CTAB extract can be separated easily from another and from contaminating material by chromatography on Serdolit PAD I and II (0.1-0.2 mm) from Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts (Heidelberg, Germany) and QAE Sephadex A-25 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany). Because HaMPT is oxidized rapidly by 02, all purification steps concerning this coenzyme have to be performed under strictly anaerobic conditions, wherever possible in a anaerobic chamber. Because HnMPT, methenylHnMPT, and F420 are sensitive to light, their solutions are kept in the dark. After separation of I-LMPT, the purification of the other coenzymes can be performed under aerobic conditions at 4° in a cold room.

Growth of M. thermoautotrophicum
The organism is grown at 65 ° in a 14-liter fermenter filled with 10 liter of medium composed as described by Sch6nheit et al. iv Generally, two fermenters are grown in parallel. The fermenter is stirred at 1000 rpm and gassed with 80% Hf120% C O 2 / 0 . 1 % H2S at a rate of 1 liter/rain until the growing culture (doubling time approximately 2.5 hr) reaches a ~A578 of 2, then at a rate of 2 liters/min. After ~z~578 of approximately 5 is reached (7-8 hr after inoculation with 10%), the culture is cooled to 10° without reducing the gas supply. The cells, approximately 90 g wet mass (20 g dried mass) per 10 liter, are then harvested at 4° by continuous centrifugation.

Coenzyme Extraction
The rotor with the cell pellet from two 10-liter cultures is transported into an anaerobic chamber, and the pellet (180 g wet mass) is transferred to a l-liter glass bottle (druckfest, No. 2181054) from Schott Glaswerke (Mainz, Germany) to which subsequently 180 ml anaerobic 50 mM MOPSNaOH, pH 6.8, containing 10 mM mercaptoethanol is added. The bottle is then closed with a rubber stopper, removed from the anaerobic chamber, and the gas phase exchanged to 100% N2 (1.5 × 105 Pa) via a needle. Now the cells are suspended by gentle shaking at 4° and the suspension is heated in a 60° water bath for 15 min. Then 45 ml of a solution at 60° of 5% CTAB containing 10 mM mercaptoethanol is added. After mixing the suspension

is incubated for exactly 6 min at 60° under gentle shaking. Thereafter the suspension is cooled to 0° in an ice bath and adjusted to pH 2.9 with 13.5 ml anaerobic 100% formic acid. The l-liter bottle is then transferred back into the anaerobic chamber, and the suspension is poured into two 500-ml centrifuging tubes made of polypropylene (Sorvall, Bad Homburg, Germany) subsequently sealed with a gas-tight screw cap. The sealed tubes are then centrifuged outside the anaerobic chamber at 4° for 60 min at 6800g and then, back inside the chamber, the 200-ml supernatant containing the coenzymes is decanted. The supernatant is designated CTAB extract. The 200-ml extract should contain 100-140/xmol H4MPT quantitated as described later. If methenyl-H4MPT rather than H4MPT is required in larger amounts the H4MPT, which leaked out of the cells after a 6-min incubation in the presence of CTAB at 60°, is converted to methenyl-H4MPT by the addition of 22.5 ml 200 mM anaerobic formaldehyde solution and by incubation for another 6 min at 60° before cooling down the suspension to 0°. Formaldehyde reacts spontaneously with H4MPT to methylene-H4MPT, which is converted to methenyl-H4MPT and H2 due to the activity of H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase also partially leaking out of the cells on CTAB treatment. Methenyl-H4MPT is much more stable than H4MPT. It does not autoxidize in the presence of 02. Purification of methenyl-H4MPT can therefore be performed under aerobic conditions just as the purification of MFR and F420.

Separation of H4MPT from Other Coenzymes
The 200-ml CTAB extract is applied in a cold room to a Serdolit PAD II column (3.2 × 15 cm) equilibrated with 1 liter anoxic H20-formic acid (69 : 1) adjusted to pH 3.0 with 10 M NaOH and containing 10 mM mercaptoethanol (buffer A) (5 ml/min). The column is washed with 3 x 100 ml buffer A, and the H4MPT is eluted with 4 x 100 ml buffer A containing 15% methanol. Under these conditions, methenyl-H4MPT, MFR, F420, and other coenzymes are retained on the column. They are subsequently eluted with 400 ml 100% methanol and separated from another as described later.

Purification of H4MPT
The four HaMPT-containing, 100-ml fractions of the Serdolit column are combined anaerobically, frozen at - 8 0 °, and lyophilized for 24 hr to approximately 40 ml to remove the methanol. The lyophilizate is diluted to 1 : 1 with H20 and the pH is adjusted to 3.0 with 100% formic acid. The solution is subsequently applied in a cold room to a Serdolit PAD I column (1.6 x 10 cm) equilibrated with 0.5 liter anaerobic buffer A (2 ml/min).

[281

The column is then washed with 100 ml 0.1% formic acid and H4MPT eluted with 6 x 10 ml 0.1% formic acid containing 30% methanol. Fractions 3-5 containing HaMPT, assayed for as described later, are pooled. Samples of 2 tzmol H4MPT are transferred to 8-ml serum bottles, frozen at - 8 0 °, and lyophilized and stored under N 2 a s gas phase at -80 °. The preparation yields approximately 60/zmol H4MPT, which is not completely pure as judged from the ultraviolet/visible spectrum but pure enough for the activity assays of the H4MPT-specific enzymes. For reasons presently not understood, some of the batches of M. thermoautotrophicum cells contain mostly methenyl-H4MPT rather than free HaMPT. In these cases the H4MPT yield is very low. The methenyl-H4MPT is recovered in the 100% methanol eluate from the first Serdolit column.

Quantification of H4MPT
The concentration of H4MPT is determined by measuring the formation of methenyl-H4MPT from H4MPT and formaldehyde as catalyzed by H2forming methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase present in cell extracts of M. thermoautotrophicum. The assays are performed at 60° in 1.5-ml anaerobic cuvettes containing 1 ml 50 mM MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.8, with N2 as the gas phase. The following additions are made successively; 5/zl cell extract of M. thermoautotrophicum; 10-50/xl H4MPT containing sample; and 30/zl 200 mM formaldehyde solution. After start of the reaction with formaldehyde the increase in absorbance at 335 nm is followed: e = 21.6 mM -1 cm -~.

Separation of Methenyl-H4MPT from MFR and F420
The 100% methanol eluate (400 ml) from the first Serdolit column is flash evaporated to 20 ml, precipitated material sedimented by centrifugation, and the supernatant diluted 1:1 with H20, adjusted to pH 3.0 with formic acid and stored at - 2 0 ° until further use. The supernatant from three preparations (from 3 × 180 g cells) are applied in a cold room to a Serdolit PAD I column (2.4 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 1 liter buffer A. [Note: If most of the methanol is removed by flash evaporation, the run through fraction already contains methenyl-H4MPT identifiable by its characteristic ultraviolet/visible spectrum: maxima at 335 nm (e = 21.6 mM cm -1) and 287 nm (e = 13.3 mM 1 cm-l).] After washing of the column with 800 ml buffer A and 500 ml buffer A containing 15% methanol, methenyl-H4MPT is eluted with 500 ml buffer A containing 25% methanol. MFR and F420 are eluted with 200 ml 100% methanol.

Purification of Methenyl-H4MPT
Methenyl-H4MPT-containing fractions from the second Serdolit column are combined, flash evaporated until most of the methanol is removed, and

324

[28]

then applied in a cold room to a Serdolit PAD I column (1.8 x 8 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing of the column with 100 ml 0.1% formic acid, methenyl-HnMPT is eluted with 25 ml 100% methanol. After flash evaporation the residue is dissolved in H20 and the concentration of methenyl-H4MPT is determined spectrophotometrically at 335 nm (e = 21.6 mM -1 cm-1). The solution is sampled in portions of 10/zmol, frozen at - 8 0 °, and lyophilized. The yield varies from preparation to preparation between 20 and 150/zmol per 3 x 180 g cells (wet mass). If the HnMPT in the CTAB extract is converted to methenyl-HaMPT as described earlier, the yield is approximately 100/zmol per 180 g cells (wet mass).

Separation of MFR and F420
The 100% methanol eluate (200 ml) from the second Serdolit column is flash evaporated to 20 ml to remove most of the methanol, the remaining solution is diluted 1 : 5 with H20, and the pH is adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH. The diluted solution is then applied in a cold room to a QAE Sephadex A-25 column (3.2 x 14 cm) equilibrated with 1 liter 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5. The column is then washed with 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, until the eluate is no longer yellow. The column is eluted with each 0.5 to 1 liter 10 mM formic acid, 20 mM formic acid, 30 mM formic acid, and 100 mM formic acid followed by each 0.3 liter 200 mM formic acid, 300 mM formic acid, and 100 mM HC1. The 20 mM formic acid eluate contains F430, the 30 mM formic acid eluate F560 the 200 mM formic acid eluate MFR, the 300 mM formic acid eluate flavins, and the 100 mM HC1 eluate F420. Elution of the compounds has to be followed spectrophotometrically. For the detection of F420 the eluate has to be neutralized before the photometric measurement.

Purification of Methanofuran
The methanofuran containing 200 mM formic acid eluate (0.3 liter) from the QAE Sephadex A-25 column is applied in a cold room to a Serdolit PAD I column (1 x 10 cm) equilibrated with 100 ml buffer A, the column is washed with 100 ml 1 mM HCI, and MFR is eluted with 20 ml 100% methanol. After reduction of the volume to approximately 1 ml by flash evaporation, the solution is diluted 1:2 with H20. The MFR concentration in an aliquot is estimated at pH 7.5 by the absorbance at 274 nm (e = 1.1 mM -1 cm-1), and the solution is sampled in portions of 10 tzmol MFR. The samples are frozen at - 8 0 ° and subsequently lyophilized. By this procedure, approximately 100 tzmol of MFR is obtained from 3 X 180 g cells (wet mass).

Synthesis and Purification of Formylmethanofuran
Formylmethanofuran is synthesized by formylation of methanofuran with p-nitrophenyl formate. The lyophilized methanofuran is dissolved by water to a concentration of 50 mM. One-third volume of tetrahydrofuran is added to the solution. Subsequently, 2 mM of p-nitrophenyl formate is added to the solution and incubated for 24 hr under continuous stirring. The pH is maintained at pH 8.0 by the addition of KOH. The product is applied on a 2.3 x 67-cm column of Sephadex G-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with water. Formylmethanofuran is eluted by water, frozen at -80 °, and lyophilized.

Purification of Coenzyme F420
The F420 containing 100 mM HC1 eluate (0.3 liter) from the QAE Sephadex column is applied in a cold room to a Serdolit PAD I column (1 x 10 cm) equilibrated with 100 ml buffer A, the column is washed with H20, and F420 is eluted with 20 ml 100% methanol. After reduction of the volume to 1 ml by flash evaporation, the solution is diluted 1 : 2 with H20. The F420 concentration is estimated in an aliquot at pH 7.0 by the absorbance at 420 nm (e -- 32 mM -1 cm-1), and the solution is sampled in portions of 2/zmol F420. The samples are frozen at -80 ° and lyophilized. Approximately 10/zmol F420 is obtained from 3 x 180 g cells (wet mass). The CTAB extract of the M. thermoautotrophicum cells contains only approximately 25% of the F420 present in M. thermoautotrophicum. To also obtain the coenzyme F420 still present in the extracted cells (from 3 x 180 g cells), these are suspended in 450 m150 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and the suspension, in 300-ml portions, is subjected at 4° to ultrasonication (200 W) for 15 min with intervals to disrupt the cells in an anaerobic chamber. Subsequently the pH is adjusted with 2 M HC104 to 2.0. After 1 hr stirring at 4°, the precipitated material is separated by centrifugation at 8000g for 30 min at 4°. The pellet is resuspended in 450 ml 10 mM HC104, stirred for 4 hr at 4°, and the suspension centrifuged at 8000g at 4° for 30 min. This is repeated four times. The supernatants are combined and applied in a cold room to a Serdolit PAD I column (2.4 x 20 cm) equilibrated with 1 liter buffer A. The column is washed with 500 ml buffer A containing 25% methanol and then F420 is eluted with 200 ml 100% methanol. The F420 in the eluate is purified further via chromatography on QAE Sephadex and Serdolit as described under "Separation of MFR and F420" and "Purification of F420." Via the HC104 extraction procedure, approximately 50 tzmol F420 is obtained from 3 x 180 g cells (wet mass) extracted previously with CTAB.

Formylmethanofuran : Tetrahydromethanopterin Formyltransferase Formyltransferase from Methanopyrus kandleri is a tetrameric enzyme, which catalyzes reaction (I), composed of only one type of subunits of apparent molecular mass 35 kDa. 73s,19 It lacks a prosthetic group. For activity and thermostability, the presence of lyotropic salts at high concentrations (>1.5 M) is required. 739,1° The encoding gene fir has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. 21 The overproduced enzyme is crystallized, and the X-ray structure is solved to 1.73 A resolution. 18'22The formyltransferase is inactivated slowly under oxic conditions. Purification is therefore performed under strictly anaerobic conditions, wherever possible, in an anaerobic chamber (see "Oxygen Sensitivity of Enzymes and Coenzymes"). The properties of the formyltransferase are summarized in Table I in which for comparison the properties of other formylmethanofuran : tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferases from other organisms are also given. The primary structures of the formyltransferases are compared in Fig. 2.

Purification of Formyltransferase from M. kandleri
Frozen cells (approximately 2 g wet mass) of M. kandleri are suspended anaerobically at room temperature in 5 ml 50 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, containing 10 mM MgC12, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 mg DNase I. The cell suspension is subsequently passed three times through a French pressure cell at 110 MPa. Cell debris are removed by anaerobic centrifugation at 27,000g for 30 min at 4°. The supernatant, which generally contains approximately 200 mg protein and 1500 U formyltransferase activity, is designated the cell extract. The 5-ml cell extract with a specific formyltransferase activity of approximately 7.5 U/mg is cooled to 0° in ice water and subsequently supplemented anaerobically with 20 ml saturated ammonium sulfate in 100 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0. After 30 min of stirring, the precipitated protein is removed by a 30-min centrifugation at 27,000g at 4°. The supernatant, which contains 99% of the formyltransferase activity, is applied to a HiLoad 26/10 phenylSepharose high-performance column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.3 M ammonium sulfate in 50 mM MOPS-KOH, pH

7.0 (4 ml/min). The column is washed with a linear decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate (0.3-0 M 180 ml) and formyltransferase is eluted at 0 M ammonium sulfate. These fractions are combined and applied directly to a Mono Q H R 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 30 ml 0.4 M NaC1 in 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0 (4 ml/min). Formyltransferase is eluted using a linear gradient of NaC1 (0.2-0.8 M 120 ml). Fractions of 4 ml are collected. Formyltransferase activity is recovered in seven fractions at 0.44-0.56 M NaC1. These fractions are combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration (PM30 membrane, Millipore, Eschborn, Germany), and diluted with 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The solution is applied to a 1.3 × 10-cm column of Macro Prep Ceramic Hydroxyapatite, Type I, 20 t~m (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mt~nchen, Germany), which is equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0 (3 ml/min). Formyltransferase is eluted using a linear gradient of potassium phosphate (0.010.5 M 260 ml). Fractions of 5 ml are collected. Formyltransferases activity is recovered in 0.07-0.12 M potassium phosphate. The combined fractions contain approximately 1 mg protein and 800 U formyltransferase activity. The solution can be stored under N2 at - 2 0 ° without loss of activity for several months. The purification procedure used is based on the findings that the enzyme is completely soluble in 80% saturated ammonium sulfate, that it binds to phenyl-Sepharose at very low ammonium sulfate concentration, that it binds to the anion-exchange resin Mono Q up to 0.4 M NaCI, and that it binds to the hydroxyapatite up to 0.07 M potassium phosphate. Exploiting these properties, the formyltransferase is enriched over 100-fold in a more than 50% yield to a specific activity of more than 800 U/mg. S D S - P A G E reveals the presence of only one band at the 35-kDa position. 7

Purification of Formyltransferase Overproduced in E. coli
Cells (approximately 5 g wet mass) of E. coli BL21 (DE3), 23 in which the fir gene was expressed, are suspended anaerobically in 14 ml 50 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol and disrupted by ultrasonication for 10 min at 100 W at 4 ° in an anaerobic chamber. Cell debris are removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 15 min at 4 °. The 10-ml supernatant, which contains approximately 330 mg protein and 25,000 U formyltransferase activity and which is designated the cell extract, is subsequently ultracentrifuged anaerobically at 140,000g for 30 min at 4 °. The supernatant is then diluted with 3 volumes of 2.0 M K2HPO4, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol and heated to 90° for 30 min. After cooling

to room temperature and 1 : 1 dilution with 50 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 8.0, precipitated material is removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 15 min followed by filtration (0.2 # M pore size). Half of the obtained protein solution is applied to a phenyl-Superose H R 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.3 M ammonium sulfate in 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol (1 ml/min). The column is washed with 90 ml of the equilibration buffer, and formyltransferase is then eluted with a step-decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate (0.1 M 30 ml; 0 M 30 ml) in 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol. Fractions of 2 ml are collected. Formyltransferase activity elutes in four fractions at 0 M ammonium sulfate concentration. The four fractions, which contain together 35 mg protein and 24,000 U formyltransferase activity, are stored at - 2 0 ° under Ne gas. The purification procedure is based on the finding that formyltransferase from M kandleri can be separated from the proteins of E. coli simply by heating for 30 min at 90 ° in 1.5 M KeHPO4 pH 8.0 (at 65°). After the removal of precipitated protein, the supernatant contains only the 35-kDa protein as revealed by SDS-PAGE. The supernatant contains nucleic acids as evidenced by a relatively high absorbance at 260 nm. Removal of these contaminants is achieved by absorption of the formyltransferase to phenylSuperose and elution with a step-decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate. Using this simple procedure, approximately 70 mg of purified enzyme is obtained from only approximately 5 g cells (wet mass). ~1

Assay of Formyltransferase Activity
The activity of formyltransferase is assayed routinely at 65 ° in 1.5-ml quartz cuvettes with Ne as the gas phase. 7 The 0.7-ml standard assay mixture contains 50 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 8.0 (at 65°), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2M K2HPO4, pH 8.0 (at 65°), 43 /xM tetrahydromethanopterin, and 70 /xM formylmethanofuran. The reaction is started by the addition of enzyme solution. The formation of NS-formyltetrahydromethanopterin is monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 282 nm (e = 5.1 mM 1 cm-1). 24 One unit activity refers to the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1/zmol formyltetrahydromethanopterin per minute under the assay conditions. Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin Cyclohydrolase The cyclohydrolase from M. kandleri, which catalyzes reaction (2), is a trimeric enzyme composed of only one type of subunit of apparent molecu~4 M. I.

lar mass 42 k D a . 25'26 It lacks a prosthetic group. For activity but not for thermostability the presence of lyotropic salts at high concentrations (> 1 M) is required. 2°,25The encoding gene mch has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in E. coli. 27 The ove~roduced enzyme was crystallized and the X-ray structure was solved to 2.0 A resolution. 26The cyclohydrolase is inactivated slowly under oxic conditions. Purification is therefore performed under anaerobic conditions, wherever possible, in an anaerobic chamber (see "Oxygen Sensitivity of Enzymes and Coenzymes"). The properties of the cyclohydrolase are summarized in Table II in which, for comparison, the properties of other methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolases from other organisms are also given. The primary structures of the formyltransferases are compared in Fig. 3.

Purification of Cyclohydrolase from M. kandleri
Frozen cells (approximately 2 g wet mass) of M. kandleri are suspended anaerobically in 5 ml 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0, containing 10 mM MgC12, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 mg DNase I. The cell suspension is subsequently passed three times through a French pressure cell at 110 MPa and 4°. Cell debris are removed by anaerobis centrifugation at 27,000g for 30 min at 4 °. The 5-ml supernatant generally contains approximately 250 mg protein and 2000 U cyclohydrolase activity. To the 5-ml cell extract cooled to 0 ° in ice water, 20 ml saturated ammonium sulfate in 100 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0 is added to give a final concentration of 80% saturation. After 30 min of stirring, the precipitated protein is removed by centrifugation at 27,000g for 30 min at 4 °. The supernatant is applied to a HiLoad 26/10 phenyl-Sepharose high-performance column equilibrated with 0.5 M ammonium sulfate in 50 mM M O P S KOH, pH 7.0. Using a linear decreasing gradient from 0.5 to 0 M ammonium sulfate (300 ml), the cyclohydrolase activity elutes between 0.21 and 0.12 M ammonium sulfate (60 ml). After combining the active fractions the enzyme is purified further by ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q H R 10/10. The column is washed with 60 ml 0.8 M KCI in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Via a linear gradient from 0.8 to 1.6 M KCI (160 ml), the cyclohydrolase activity is recovered in one fraction (4 ml) at 1.32 M KC1. This fraction contains approximately 0.3 mg protein and 1400 U cyclohydrolase activity. The solution can be stored under N2 at - 2 0 ° for several months without a significant loss in activity.

The purification procedure is based on the finding that the enzyme is completely soluble in 80% saturated ammonium sulfate, that it binds to phenyl-Sepharose at ammonium sulfate concentration above 0.25 M, and that it binds to the anion-exchange resin Mono Q up to 1.3 M KC1. Exploiting these properties, the cyclohydrolase is enriched over 600-fold in more than 60% yield to a specific activity of more than 5000 U/mg. SDSP A G E reveals the presence of only one band at the 42-kDa position. 2s

Purification of Cyclohydrolase Overproduced in E. coli
Cells (approximately 3.5 g wet mass) of E. coli BL21 (DE3), in which the mch gene was overexpressed, are suspended anaerobically in 10 ml 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.0, and a cell extract is prepared at 4° by ultrasonication followed by centrifugation at 4° for 30 min at 12,000g. The 10-ml supernatant generally contains approximately 250 mg protein and 100,000 U cyclohydrolase. Most of the E. coli proteins can be separated from the cyclohydrolase simply by precipitation in 80% ammonium sulfate. To a 10-ml extract cooled to 0 ° in ice water, 40 ml saturated ammonium sulfate in 100 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.0, is added. After 30 min stirring, the precipitated proteins are removed by a 30-min centrifugation at 27,000g. The supernatant contains more than 96% of the cyclohydrolase activity and essentially only a 55-kDa protein as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Removal from contaminating nucleic acid is achieved by adsorption of the 55-kDa protein to a HiLoad 26/10 phenylSepharose high-performance column followed by elution with decreasing concentrations of ammonium sulfate in 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.0:60 ml 0.5 M ammonium sulfate; 60 ml 0.25 M ammonium sulfate; and 60 ml 0 M ammonium sulfate. The cyclohydrolase activity elutes at 0 M ammonium sulfate in two 5-ml fractions. Using this simple procedure, 18 mg of the purified cyclohydrolase is obtained from only 3.5 g cells (wet mass). During purification the specific activity increases from approximately 400 U/mg in the cell extract to over 5000 U/mg in the phenyl-Sepharose eluate. The activity yield is approximately 90%. 27 S D S - P A G E of the purified enzyme reveals the presence of two different migrating polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 55 and 41 kDa. The relative amount of the 41-kDa form increases when the salt concentration in the sample analyzed is decreased and vice versa. When the samples are heated for 30 min rather than for the usual 3 min prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE, only the 41-kDa migrating form is observed; without heating, only the 55-kDa form is found. This finding indicates that binding of SDS to the cyclohydrolase is strongly affected by salts and temperature and probably reflects the fact that the enzyme is a highly acidic protein (p/3.8), which binds much less SDS than normal proteins, e7

Assay o f Cyclohydrolase Activity

The standard assay is carried out at 65 ° in 1.5-ml glass cuvettes with N2 as the gas phase. 2s The 0.7-ml assay mixture contains 50 m M Tricine-KOH, pH 8.0 (at 65°), 1.5 M K2HPO4, pH 8.0, and 30/xM methenyltetrahydromethanopterin. The reactions are started by the addition of enzyme solution. The disappearance of methenyltetrahydromethanopterin is monitored by following the decrease in absorbance at 335 nm (e = 21.6 mM -1 cm 1). One unit (IU) equals 1/xmol methenyltetrahydromethanopterin hydrolyzed to NS-formyltetrahydromethanopterin per minute under these conditions. F 4 2 0 - D e p e n d e n t M e t h y l e n e t e t r a h y d r o m e t h a n o p t e r i n Dehydrogenase The F420-dependent dehydrogenase from M. kandleri, which catalyzes reaction (3), is an octameric enzyme composed of only one type of subunit of apparent molecular mass 36 kDa. 2s It lacks a prosthetic group. For activity but not for thermostahility the presence of relatively high concentrations of lyotropic salts is required. The enzyme is Si-face stereospecific with respect to C5 of F420 and Re-face stereospecific with respect to the methylene group of methylene-H4MPT. 29 The encoding gene mtd has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed heterologously in E. coll. 3° The overproduced enzyme is fully active. The dehydrogenase is inactivated slowly under oxic conditions. Purification has therefore to be performed under strictly anaerobic conditions, wherever possible, in an anaerobic chamber (see "Oxygen Sensitivity of Enzymes and Coenzymes"). The properties of the dehydrogenase are summarized in Table III in which, for comparison, the properties of other F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenases from other organisms are also given. The primary structures of the dehydrogenases are compared in Fig. 4.

FI6. 4. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Mtd) from Methanopyrus kandleri (Mp. k.), Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum strain Marburg (Mb. t.), Methanococcus jannaschii (Mc. j. ), and Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Ag. f.). Identical amino acid residues occurring in all four proteins are boxed and shaded.

suspension is subsequently passed three times through a French pressure cell at 110 MPa and 4°. Cell debris are removed by centrifugation at 27,000g for 30 min at 4°. The 10-ml supernatant, designated the cell extract, typically contains 550 mg protein and approximately 12,000 U methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase activity. The activity in the cell extract is independent of the addition of coenzyme F420. F420-dependent dehydrogenase activity can only be seen after removal of the H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase by chromatography on phenylSepharose and Blue Sepharose as described later. Yields and purification factors can therefore not be given.

The 10-ml cell extract cooled to 0° in ice water is supplemented with 15 ml saturated ammonium sulfate solution in 100 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.0, to give a final concentration of 60% saturation. After 30 rain of stirring, the precipitated protein is removed by 30 min centrifugation at 27,000g. The supernatant is applied to a HiLoad 26/10 phenyl-Sepharose highperformance column equilibrated with 2.0 M ammonium sulfate in 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.8. The column is washed with 2 M ammonium sulfate, and the protein is eluted with a decreasing gradient (in 50 mM Tris-HC1), pH 7.8, of ammonium sulfate (2 to 1 M in 100 ml; 50 ml 1 M; 1 to 0.6 M in 100 ml; 30 ml 0.6 M; 0.6 to 0 M in 100 ml). Fractions of 8 ml are collected. The main methylene-HnMPT dehydrogenase activity is recovered in five fractions at an ammonium sulfate concentration between 0.6 and 0.5 M. These five fractions are combined and concentrated to 2 ml by ultrafiltration (PM30 membrane). The concentrate is diluted 1 : 10 with 50 mM M O P S KOH, pH 7.0, and then applied to a 3 x 10-cm column of Blue Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which is equilibrated with 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0. The protein is eluted with a step gradient (in 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0) of NaC1 (100 ml 0 M NaC1, 100 ml 0.4 M NaC1, 100 ml 0.8 M NaC1), and fractions of 8 ml are collected. The activity is found in six fractions at 0.4 M NaC1. These fractions are pooled and concentrated to 5 ml by ultrafiltration (PM30 membrane) and then diluted 1 : 5 with 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0, before application to a Mono Q H R 10/10 anion-exchange column equilibrated with 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0. The protein is eluted via the following gradient (in 50 mM M O P S KOH, pH 7.0): 0 to 0.45 M NaCI in 35 ml; 0.45 to 0.70 M NaC1 in 105 ml: and 0.70 to 1 M NaCI in 20 ml. The enzyme activity is recovered in one 4ml fraction corresponding to a NaCI concentration of 0.6 M. This fraction is diluted by a factor of three with 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0, and reapplied to a Mono Q H R 10/10 column equilibrated with 50 mM M O P S KOH, pH 7.0. The protein is eluted with the following gradient (in 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0): 0 to 0.55 M NaCI in 20 ml, 10 ml 0.55 M NaC1, and 0.55 to 0.65 M NaCI in 110 ml. The main activity is recovered in three 4ml fractions at a NaC1 concentration of 0.6 M. The fractions, which contain typically approximately 0.2 mg protein and 300 U F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase activity, are combined, washed, and concentrated to 1 ml by means of PM30 ultrafiltration membranes. The solution can be stored under N2 at - 2 0 ° without significant loss of activity for at least 4 weeks. The purification procedure is based on the finding that the enzyme is completely soluble in 60% saturated ammonium sulfate, that it binds to phenyl-Sepharose at an ammonium sulfate concentration above 0.6 M, and that it binds to Blue Sepharose at NaC1 concentrations below 0.4 M and

342

to Mono Q below 0.6 M. Exploiting these properties, F420-dependent dehydrogenase is purified to a specific activity of about 1300 U/mg. SDSP A G E reveals the presence of only one major band at the 36-kDa position. 28

Purification of F420-Dependent Dehydrogenase Overproduced in E. Coli
Cells (approximately 2.5 g wet mass) of E. coli BL21 (DE3), in which the mtd gene was expressed, are suspended anaerobically in 30 ml 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0, and disrupted in a French pressure cell at 110 MPa. Cell debris are removed by centrifugation at 27,000g for 30 min at 4°. This cell extract, which typically contains 160 mg protein and 46,000 U enzyme activity, is subjected to heat denaturation for 30 min at 90°. Precipitated protein is removed by ultracentrifugation at 80,000g for 30 min at 4 °. In the 80,000g supernatant (45 mg protein, 43,000 U activity) only one protein with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa is visible after S D S - P A G E and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. However, the supernatant has a pale green color and contains low molecular mass polypeptides and nucleotides. Therefore, the supernatant is applied to a HiLoad 16/10 Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0. The column is washed with 50 mM equilibration buffer and eluted with 200 ml of a linear increasing gradient of NaC1 from 0.25 to 0.7 M. Fractions of 6 ml are collected. Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase activity elutes in six fractions at 0.40.55 M NaC1. These fractions, which contain approximately 41,000 U activity and 26 mg protein, are combined, washed, and concentrated to 1 ml by means of PM30 ultrafiltration membranes and Centricon 30 microconcentrators (Millipore). The enzyme can be stored at - 2 0 ° under N2 without significant loss of activity for at least 4 weeks. 3°

Assay for F420-Dependent Dehydrogenase Activity
Routinely the rate of the F420-dependent oxidation of methyleneHaMPT to methenyl-H4MPT is determined at 65 ° in 1.5-ml quartz cuvettes with N2 as the gas phase. 28 The 0.7-ml assay mixture contains 120 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0; 35/zM HnMPT; 8 mM formaldehyde; 23/zM F420; and 1 M ammonium sulfate. The reaction is started by the addition of enzyme solution. The formation of methenyl-H4MPT is monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 335 nm (e = 21.6 mM -1 cm-1). The H2-forming methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase is measured using the same assay with the exception that F420 is omitted. One unit refers to the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 /xmol methenyl-H4MPT from methylene-HnMPT per minute under the assay conditions.

If the rate of F420 H2-dependent reduction of methenyl-H4MPT is to be determined the assays are carried out at 65 ° in 1.5-ml quartz cuvettes with N2 as the gas phase. The 0.7-ml assay contains 120 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0; 35/zM methenyl-H4MPT; and 23 tzM F420 plus 5 mM Na2S204 for the reduction of F420 to F420H2. After 10 min at 65 °, 15 mM formaldehyde is added, which quenches the excess dithionite. The reaction is started by the addition of enzyme. The conversion of methenyl-H4MPT to methylene-H4MPT is monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 335 nm. This assay cannot be employed to test the activity in crude extracts and in the 60% amonium sulfate supernatant due to the presence of a high activity of methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase and F420-reducing hydrogenase.

H2-Forming Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin Dehydrogenase The H2-forming dehydrogenase from M. kandleri, which catalyzes reactions (4), is a tetrameric enzyme composed of only one type of subunits of apparent molecular mass 44 kDa. 31 It lacks a prosthetic group. For activity the presence of lyotropic salts is required but the concentrations required (0.1 M) are much lower than in the case of the other H4MPT-specific enzymes from M. kandleri. The enzyme is inactivated rapidly at 90 °. Thermostability is somewhat increased in the presence of high concentrations of potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, but the effect is much less pronounced that in the case of the formyltransferase from M. kandlri. The enzyme is Re-face stereospecific with respect to the methylene group of methyleneHzMPT as determined for the enzyme from M. thermoautotrophicum. 32 The h m d gene encoding the enzyme has been cloned and sequenced and expressed heterologously in E. coli. 33'3a The overproduced enzyme is, however, inactive. The dehydrogenase is inactivated under oxic conditions. Purification has, therefore, to be performed under strictly anaerobic condition, wherever possible, in an anaerobic chamber. The properties of the dehydrogenase are summarized in Table IV in which, for comparison, the properties of other Hz-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenases from other organisms are also given. The primary structures of the dehydrogenases are compared in Fig. 5.

Purification of H2-forming Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin Dehydrogenase from M. kandleri
Frozen cells (approximately 6 g wet mass) of M. kandleri are suspended in 20 ml 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.8, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mg DNase I and subsequently passed three times through a French pressure cell at 110 MPa under strictly anaerobic conditions. Cell debris are removed by anaerobic centrifugation at 27,000g for 30 min at 4 °. The 20-ml supernatant, in the following designated cell extract, typically contains 400 mg protein and 2800 U dehydrogenase activity. The 20-ml cell extract is diluted with 80 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate in 100 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0. Precipitated protein is removed by centrifugation at 15,000g for 15 min. More than 90% of the methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase activity is recovered in the supernarant. After filtration (0.2 tzM pore size) the filtrate is diluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, to a final ammonium sulfate concentration of 1.8 M, and this solution is then applied to a HiLoad 26/10 phenyl-Sepharose highperformance column, which is equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 2.1 M ammonium sulfate (2 ml/min). The column is washed with 50 ml of this buffer and then with buffer containing 2.1-1.4 M ammonium sulfate (70 ml, linear gradient) and 1.4-0 M (380 ml, linear gradient). Six-milliliter fractions are collected. Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase activity elutes at ammonium sulfate concentrations of 0.45 to 0.15 M. The eight fractions with highest activities are combined, desalted, and concentrated to 14 ml by ultrafiltration (PM30 membrane) and are then applied to a Mono Q H R 10/10 column equilibrated previously with 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.8 (3 ml/min). The column is washed with 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.8 containing 0 M NaC1 (50 ml), 0.46 M NaC1 (35 ml), 0.46-0.64 M NaC1 (110 ml, linear gradient), and 2 M NaC1 (20 ml). Threemilliliter fractions are collected. Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase activity elutes at NaCI concentrations of 0.54 to 0.56 M. The three fractions with the highest activity are combined. The resulting solution typically contains approximately 2.5 mg protein and 900 U dehydrogenase activity. The enzyme loses about 20% of the activity when the solution is stored under N2 at - 2 0 ° for 2 weeks. The purification procedure is based on the finding that the enzyme is completely soluble in 80% saturated ammonium sulfate, that it binds to phenyl-Sepharose at ammonium sulfate concentrations above 0.5 M, and that it binds to the anion-exchange resin Mono Q below 0.5 M. Exploiting these properties, the H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase is purified 50-fold to a specific activity of 360 U/mg in a 32% yield.

ENZYMES OF CENTRAL METABOLISM

[28]

Assay of H2-Forming Dehydrogenase Activity
The standard assay is carried out at 65 ° in 1.5-ml quartz cuvettes with N2 as the gas phase. 31 The 0.7-ml assay mixture contains 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 5.8, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 4 mM formaldehyde, and 16 /xM I-I4MPT. The reaction is started by the addition of enzyme solution. The rate of methenyl-HaMPT formation from methylene-HaMPT is determined by following the increase in absorbance at 335 nm (e = 21.6 mM -1 cm-a). One unit refers to the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 ~mol methenyl-H4MPT from methylene-H4MPT per minute under the assay conditions. If the rate of methenyl-H4MPT reduction with H2 to methylene-H4MPT is to be determined, the assay is carried out at 65 ° in 1.5-ml quartz cuvettes with H2 as the gas phase. The 1-ml assay mixture contains 120 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, and 35/xM methenyl-HaMPT. The reaction is started by the addition of enzyme. The rate of methenylHaMPT conversion to methylene-H4MPT is determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 335 nm (e = 21.6 m M -1 c m - 1 ) . F420-Dependent Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin Reductase The reductase from M. kandleri, which catalyzes reaction (5), is a tetrameric enzyme composed of only one type of subunit of apparent molecular mass of 38 k D a Y It lacks a prosthetic group. For maximal activity, approximately 2 M concentrations of lyotropic salts are required; for thermostability, only approximately 0.1 M. The enzyme is Si-face stereospecific with respect to C5 of F420 as determined for the enzyme from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. 36 The encoding gene mer from M. kandleri has been cloned and sequenced. 37 The gene has been expressed heterologously in E. coli. The overproduced enzyme is mainly recovered in the inclusion body fraction. 38 The enzyme purified from M. kandleri has been crystallized and its structure was solved to 1.7 m. 39 The reductase is inactivated slowly under oxic conditions. Purification therefore has to be performed under strictly anaerobic conditions, wherever possible, in an anaerobic chamber (see "Oxygen Sensitivity of Enzymes and Coenzymes"). The properties of the reductase are summarized in Table V in which, for comparison, the properties of the methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase from other organisms are

anaerobic conditions at 4 °. Cell debris are removed by anaerobic centrifugation at 27,000g for 30 min at 4 °. The 12-ml supernatant, designated the cell extract, contains approximately 260 mg protein and 600 U reductase activity. The cell extract is subsequently centrifuged at 4 ° for 30 min at 160,000g. The supernatant is diluted with saturated ammonium sulfate in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to give a final concentration of 80% saturation. After 30 min stirring, the precipitated protein is removed at 4 ° by 30 min centrifugation at 27,000g. The supernatant is applied to a HiLoad 26/10 phenylSepharose high-performance column equilibrated with 1.3 M ammonium sulfate in 50 mM M O P S - K O H , pH 7.0. Using a linear decreasing gradient from 0.8 to 0 M ammonium sulfate (500 ml), the methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase activity elutes between 0.72 and 0.64 M ammonium sulfate. After combining the active fractions, the enzyme is purified further by Mono Q H R 10/10 equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (3 ml/ min). The column is washed with 15 ml of this buffer, with 35 ml 0.4 M NaCI in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and with a linear NaCI gradient (0.4-0.56 M, 110 ml). Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase activity is found in the fractions eluting at 0.5 M NaCI. These fractions are pooled, concentrated to 5 ml by ultrafiltration, and desalted in a Centricon 30 microconcentrator. The purified enzyme, approximately 3 mg protein with a specific activity of 300 U/mg, can be stored in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, under N2 at - 2 0 ° without considerable loss of activity for at least several weeks. The purification procedure is based on the finding that the reductase is completely soluble in 80% saturated ammonium sulfate, that it binds to phenyl-Sepharose at ammonium sulfate concentrations above 0.7 M, and that it binds to Mono Q at NaCI concentrations below 0.5 M. Exploiting these properties, the reductase is enriched over 120-fold in more than 80% yield to a specific activity of more than 300 U/mg. S D S - P A G E reveals the presence of only one band at the 38-kDa position. 35

Assay of Reductase Activity
The standard assay is carried out at 65° in 1.5-ml quartz cuvettes with N2 as the gas phase. 35 The 1-ml assay mixture contains 300 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 2.2 M ammonium sulfate (the pH readjusted to pH 6.8 after the addition of the ammonium sulfate), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 14/zM coenzyme F420, and 0.7 mM Na2S204 for the reduction of F420 to F420H2. After 3-4 min at 65 °, 15 mM formaldehyde is added, which quenches excess dithionite. After another minute, 16 txM H4MPT is added. MethyleneHnMPT is formed spontaneously from H4MPT and excess formaldehyde under these conditions. The methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase reaction is started with the addition of enzyme solution. The rate of oxida-

Ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 4.1.1.39) is the most abundant enzyme on our planet and plays one of the most important roles in our ecosystem. It catalyzes the covalent addition of carbon dioxide to ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate, producing two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) (Fig. 1). The function and the abundance of the enzyme provide a major link between inorganic and organic carbon in our biosphere. The fixed carbon is then converted into sugars and other cell material, which will ultimately be utilized as the carbon and energy source of virtually all heterotrophic organisms. The significance of Rubisco has attracted scientists for decades, consequently leading to an extraordinary accumulation of knowledge on the enzyme. ~ 5 Rubisco is found predominantly in higher plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic bacteria. In these organisms, Rubisco has been found to catalyze a second reaction in the presence of oxygen; ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate and oxygen are converted to one molecule of 3PGA and one
