Abstract Several complexes of the type, [M{S2CNR}3] (1) (M =Ga or In; R=CH2CH2OCH2CH2, CH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2), [MCl2{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}] (2) (M=Ga or In), [MCl{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}2] (3) (M = Ga or In), [Ga{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}{S2P(OR)2}2] (4) (R=Et, Pri) and [M{S2CNR}{(SCH2CH2)2O}] (5) (M= Ga or In; R= CH2CH2OCH2CH2, CH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2) have been prepared. All the complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, IR and NMR (1H, 13 C{1H}) spectroscopy. 71Ga NMR chemical shifts and half line widths are influenced by the coordination number of gallium and the substituents on the ligand moiety. Single crystal X-ray structures of two complexes [M{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}3] (M =Ga, In) have been determined. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

1. Introduction Compounds containing metal sulfur bonds have attracted considerable attention during the last three decades due to their synthetic and structural aspects [1], spectroscopic and theoretical features [2] and their biochemistry [3]. More recently, their relevance in catalysis [4] and materials science [5] has been demonstrated. Among the sulfur ligands, the dithiocarbamate species (RR%NCS2- ) form an important family of classical anionic ligands. These anions are 3-electron donors, capable of stabilising metal centres in a variety of oxidation states [6]. Besides their extensive technological applications [6], these ligands are still of topical interest as a potential source of novel structures. The significance of III ­ VI materials (particularly those of Ga and In), formed in different stoichiometries [7,8], in various electronic applications has provided a stimulus for the current interest in the chemistry of Group 13 elements with chalcogen ligands.

include thiolates [9], thiocarboxylates [10], xanthates [11], dithiophosphates [12,13], monothiocarbamates [14 ­16] and dithiocarbamates [17 ­20]. The gallium ­indium complexes with the latter ligands have usually been isolated as tris-chelates. The ligands in general contain simple R groups on the nitrogen atom. The tris-chelates have been employed as molecular precursors for the preparation of M2S3 by us [20] and others [17 ­19]. These developments have motivated us to study the chemistry of gallium and indium complexes with internally functionalized ligands, viz. Nmethylpiperazine and morpholine dithiocarbamates. The results of this work are reported herein.

2. Experimental Except for the preparation of tris-complexes, all other reactions were carried out under anhydrous conditions using Schlenk techniques. High purity metal trichlorides (Trans Metal), 2-mercaptoethylether (Aldrich), morpholine, N-methylpiperazine, Me2NCS2Na·3H2O and Et2NCS2Na·3H2O were obtained from commercial sources.

[21] and morpholine and N-methylpiperazine dithiocarbamates [22,23] were prepared by literature methods. The infrared spectra were recorded as Nujol mulls between CsI plates on a Bomem MB-102 FT spectrometer. 1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H} and 71Ga{1H} NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solutions in 5 mm tubes on a Bruker DPX-300 NMR spectrometer operating at 300.13, 75.44, 121.44 and 91.53 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts were referenced to the internal CHCl3 peak (l 7.26 and 77.0 ppm) for 1H and 13C, respectively, external 85% H3PO4 for 31P and external GaCl3 solution in D2O (known to form Ga(H2O)63 + [24]) for 71 Ga.

2.7. Preparation of [Ga{S2CN(CH2)4NMe}{(SCH2CH2)2O}] (5a)
[GaCl{(SCH2CH2)2O}], prepared by stirring a C6H6 solution of GaCl3 (1.89 g, 10.73 mmol) and [(NaSCH2CH2)2O}] [obtained from (HSCH2CH2)2O (1.48 g, 10.72 mmol) and Na (0.49 g, 21.3 mmol) in MeOH and then dried in vacuo] for 3 h, was treated with potassium salt of N-methylpiperazine dithiocarbamate (2.30 g, 10.73 mmol). The whole was stirred at room temperature (r.t.) for 3 h. Precipitated salts were filtered off and the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to give a dirty white solid (3.90 g, 95%). [In{S2CN(CH2)4NMe}{(SCH2CH2)2O}] (5b), [Ga{S2CN(CH2)4O}{(SCH2CH2)2O}] (5c) and [In{S2CN(CH2)4O}{(SCH2CH2)2O}] (5d) were prepared in an identical manner.

2.8. X-ray crystallography
X-ray data of the isostructural systems [M{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}3] (M=Ga, In) which crystallize with a molecule of (disordered) dichloromethane (Table 2) were collected at 173(2) K on a Siemens P3 diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo Ka radia, tion (u= 0.71073 A) employing the ­2q scan technique. The unit cell parameters were determined for 25 reflections measured by random search routine. The intensity data were corrected for Lp and absorption effects. The structures were solved using direct methods. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. A disorder model (ring inversion) was used for the N(3)­O(3) containing six-membered ring in the Ga compound (CCDC Nos. 167589 for Ga and 167588 for In).

3. Results and discussion Several gallium(III) and indium(III) complexes with morpholine and N-methylpiperazine have been prepared. The reaction of MCl3 with 3 equiv. of sodium­ potassium salt of dithiocarbamate in methanol (for Ga) or water (for In) resulted in the formation of [M(S2CNR)3] (1) (R = CH2CH2OCH2CH2 , CH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2 ) as colourless crystalline solids (Eq. (1)). Treatment of MCl3 with sodium salt of morpholine dithiocarbamate in 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratio afforded chloro complexes [MCl2{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}] (2) (M= Ga (2a), In (2b)) and [MCl{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}2] (3) (M= Ga (3a), In (3b)), respectively

2.6. Preparation of [Ga{S2CN(CH2)4O}{S2P(OEt)2}2] (4a)
To a methanolic solution (20 ml) of GaCl3 (1.17 g, 6.64 mmol), a solution of Na salt of morpholine dithiocarbamate (1.22 g, 6.59 mmol) in MeOH (25 ml) was added slowly and stirred for 3 h. The MeOH was evaporated in vacuo and the solid was suspended in dry CHCl3. To it a CHCl3 solution of ammonium diethyldithiophosphate (2.70 g, 13.30 mmol) was added and stirred which was continued for 4 h. The mixture

(Eq. (2)). However, similar reactions with [KS2CN(CH2CH2)2NMe] yielded only 1. Treatment of 2a with ammonium dialkyldithiophosphate gave mixed ligand complexes, [Ga{S2CN(CH2)4O}{S2P(OR)2}2] (4) (Eq. (3)). Yet another series of mixed ligand complexes [M{(SCH2CH2)2O}{S2CNR}] (5) could be isolated by the reaction of MCl3 with sodium salt of 2-mercaptoethylether followed by addition of dithiocarbamate in 1:1:1 stoichiometry (Eq. (4)). All the complexes 1 ­ 5 are colorless crystalline solids. They are soluble in common organic solvents, except 2 and 3, which are sparingly soluble in chloroform and benzene. MCl3 + 3[KS2CN(CH2)4NMe]  [M{S2CN(CH2)4NMe}3]+ 3KCl MCl3 + n[NaS2CN(CH2)4O]  [MCl3 - n {S2CN(CH2)4O}n ]+ nNaCl (n =1, 2, 3) [GaCl2{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}] +2[NH4S2P(OR)2]  [Ga{S2CN(CH2)4O}{S2P(OR)2}2]+ 2NH4Cl (R= Et or Pri ) MCl3 + [NaSCH2CH2)2O] +Na/KS2CNR  [M{S2CNR}{(SCH2CH2)2O}] +Na/KCl (4) (3) (2) (1)

The infrared spectra of these complexes exhibited strong bands in the regions 1155­ 1134 and 1009­ 980 cm - 1 attributable to wCNC and w C S, respectively [25]. Interpretation of the w M Cl and w M S absorptions have been made by comparison of the infrared spectra of the free ligands, chloro complexes and the tris-derivatives. An absorption at 37292 (in [GaCl3 - nLn ] (n= 1 or 2)) [12,21] and 327 cm - 1 (in [InCl3 - nLn ]) [13,26], absent in the spectra of free ligands and in tris-complexes have been assigned to w M Cl stretchings. Similarly, absorptions in the region 316­ 370 (for gallium complexes) and 319­ 375 cm - 1 (for indium complexes) absent in the spectra of free ligands may be assigned to w M S absorptions [26­ 29]. In the spectra of mixed thiolate complexes (5) two ­ three such absorptions appeared in these regions. The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra of these complexes exhibited characteristic resonances due to the ligand protons­ carbons at room temperature (Table 3). The dithiocarbamate ligand protons in the 1H NMR spectra of 1­5 were little affected with other substituents (metal or chloride) as each set of resonances appeared in a narrow region. The methylene proton signals appeared as triplets. In the 13C{1H} NMR spectra the quarternary carbon resonance had low intensity as expected and in a few cases could not be resolved. This signal showed substituent dependance. It was deshielded on substituting chloride with dithiocar-

bamate ligands as in [MCl3 - n {S2CN(CH2)4O}n ] (M= Ga or In). However, other resonances were little affected either on changing the metal ion (e.g. Ga or In) or the chloride ligand with dithiocarbamate. The 31P NMR spectra of [Ga{S2CN(CH2)4O}{S2P(OR)2}2] displayed a single resonance. These values can be compared with the corresponding tris-dithiophosphates, [Ga{S2P(OR)2}3] [12]. The 1H NMR spectra of [M{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}{(SCH2CH2)2O}] exhibited four triplets due to methylene protons as expected. There is little change in the chemical shift on substituting gallium with indium. However, in the 13C{1H} NMR spectra, the CS2 carbon resonance is deshielded on replacing gallium with indium. Although there are only a few reports on 71Ga (I=3/ 2, natural abundance 39.6%) NMR spectroscopy [30], it would be an important probe to study the behaviour of gallium with simple and chelating ligands-- a relatively underdeveloped area. The 71Ga NMR chemical shifts cover rather a broad range (ca. 1500 ppm) with half line width at times as great as 37 kHz [31]. In order to throw some light on the solution behaviour of gallium dithiocarbamate complexes, 71Ga{1H} NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 (Table 3). The 71Ga NMR resonance for all the tris-complexes is considerably shielded relative to the six-coordinate hexa-aquo ion, [Ga(H2O)6]3 + . The effect of the organic groups of dithiocarbamate ligands are reflected on the 71Ga NMR chemical shifts. The resonance is deshielded with increasing steric demand of the R group (i.e. MeB Et B Pri). The substituents effects are also seen on the half line width of the signal (Fig. 1). The D1/2 decreases with decreasing size of the R group (Me, Et, Pri). The 71 Ga signal for morpholine and N-methylpiperazine complexes appeared close to the signal for S2CNEt2 derivative, but with greater half line width. The X-ray structural analyses of [Ga{S2CN(CH2)5}3] [21] and [Ga{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}3] (see later) have revealed an octahedral geometry around gallium atom. The observed 71Ga NMR shifts can be interpreted in terms of octahedral geometry around gallium atom. The X-ray structure of [GaCl{S2CNMe2}2] [21] has shown a square pyramidal environment around gallium atom. It is likely that mono­chloro complexes with other dithiocarbamate ligands have a similar structure. The 71Ga NMR spectrum of [GaCl{S2CN(CH2)4O}2] displayed a broad resonance at l 77.2 ppm. The signal is considerably downfield shifted ( 150 ppm) from the hexa-coordinated complexes and is upfield ( 150 ppm) from the four-coordinate regime (sodium gallate l 223.3 ppm). This may be interpretated in terms of penta-coordinate structure for gallium in solution. The increased line width may be attributed to the asymmetry in the electric field gradient (efg) around the gallium nucleus due to the presence of different ligands. The 71 Ga measurements of [GaCl2{S2CN(CH2)4O}] were

dianion coordinates the indium atom using both sulfur atoms and the ether oxygen atom while at the same time one of the sulfur atoms bridges the second indium atom of the dinuclear species [29]. The dithiocarbamate complexes, [M{(SCH2CH2)2O}{S2CNR}] (5), reported here are likely to have a similar structure since the R2NCS2 ligands are isoelectronic and isostructural to the dithiophosphates. The molecular structures of [M{S2CN(CH2CH2)2O}3] (M=Ga, In) as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 (the CH2Cl2 solvate molecule is omitted) have been established unambiguously by single crystal X-ray diffraction analy-

thwarted due to poor solubility of the complex coupled with extensive line broadening of the resonance. The 27 Al NMR chemical shifts have also been reported to depend on the coordination number of aluminium and deviation from spherical geometry around aluminium nucleus resulted in broadening of the resonances [32,33]. Unlike 27Al NMR spectroscopy, deviation of chemical shifts with changes in coordination number and signal half line widths with ligand substituents are more pronounced in 71Ga NMR spectroscopy. The structures of [In{S2P(OR)2}{SCH2CH2)2O}] (R = Et or Pri) established by X-ray diffraction analyses showed a dimeric structure. The 2-mercaptoethylether

ses. Selected bond lengths and angles for the isostructural systems are given in Table 4. The six sulphur atoms from three chelating dithiocarbamate moeties in each molecule are arranged in a distorted octahedral environment around the central metal atom. The observed distortion from ideal geometry may be attributed to the small bite angle (B S M S being 73.5° for Ga and 69.6° for In) of the chelating dithio-ligand. Decreased ligand bite with increasing size of the metal atom results in opening of the S C S angle (115.9° in the Ga and 118.0° in the In derivative). The overall geometry of these complexes closely resembles those reported for related dithiocarbamates [20,34­ 36]. All six M S distances are very similar and agree well with the reported values [13,34­ 39]. The C S distances , are also similar (close to 1.72 A) within experimental error in the two molecules, indicating delocalization in the CS2 skeleton. The C N distances, which are close to , 1.33 A, are significantly shorter than the normal single bond, suggesting considerable double bond character, as expected for metal dithiocarbamates. The four-membered `MS2C' rings are planar while the six-membered heterocyclic rings adopt a puckered conformation; the angles between the SCS and CNC planes range from 4.6° to 9.4° for the non-disordered morpholine rings, confirming the efficient p electron conjugation.
