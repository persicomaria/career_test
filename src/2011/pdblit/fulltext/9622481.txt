ABSTRACT: On the basis of a comparison of high-resolution solution structures calculated for both equilibrium forms of rat ferrocytochrome b5, differences in reduction potential and thermodyanmic stability have been characterized in terms of significant structural and dynamic differences between the two forms. The dominant difference between A and B conformations has long been known to be due to a 180° rotation of the heme in the binding pocket about an axis defined by the R- and -meso carbons, however, the B form has not been structurally characterized until now. The most significant differences observed between the two forms were the presence of a hydrogen bond between the 7-propionate and the S64 amide in the A form but not the B form and surprisingly a displacement of the heme out of the binding pocket by 0.9 Å in the B form relative to the A form. The magnitude of other factors which could contribute to the known difference in reduction potentials in the bovine protein [Walker, F. A., Emrick, D., Rivera, J. E., Hanquet, B. J., and Buttlaire, D. H. (1988) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110, 6234-6240], such as differences in the orientation of the axial imidazoles and differences in hydrogen bond strength to the imidazoles, have been evaluated. The dominant effector of the reduction potential would appear to be the lack of the hydrogen bond to the S64 amide in the B form which frees up the propionate to charge stabilize the iron in the oxidized state and thus lower the reduction potential of the B form. The structure we report for the A form, based on heteronuclear NMR restraints, involving a total of 1288 restraints strongly resembles both the X-ray crystal structure of the bovine protein and a recently reported structure for the A form of the rat protein based on homonuclear data alone [Banci, L., Bertini, I., Ferroni, F., and Rosato, A. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 249, 270-279]. The rmsd for the backbone atoms of the A form is 0.54 Å (0.92 Å for all non-hydrogens). The rmsd for the backbone of the B form is 0.51 Å (0.90 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms). An analysis of backbone dynamics based on a model-free analysis of 15N relaxation data, which incorporated axially symmetric diffusion tensor modeling of the cytochrome, indicates that the protein is more rigid in the reduced state relative to the oxidized state, based on a comparison with order parameters reported for the bovine protein in the oxidized state [Kelly, G. P., Muskett, F. W., and Whitford, D. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 245, 349-354].

Cytochrome b5 is a b-type cytochrome which unlike other cytochromes plays an essential role in a number of important physiological processes (1). In the liver, cytochrome b5 exists in a membrane-bound form where it serves as an alternate donor to P450 in the metabolism of certain

xenobiotics. The membrane-bound forms are also involved in fatty acid desaturation and in cholesterol and testosterone biosynthesis. The membrane-bound form is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum via a hydrophobic helix. Cytochrome b5 also exists as a 12 kDa soluble heme-binding domain lacking the hydrophobic helix in erythrocytes where it serves as the terminal electron donor in the reduction of methemoglobin. The soluble heme-binding domain of the protein has been studied extensively crystallographically (2, 3) and by NMR1 solution methods (4-14). Cytochrome b5 has been the subject of numerous studies in recent years for four principle reasons: in complex with its numerous electron-transfer partners as a model system for long-range biological electron transfer (15-18), to understand protein factors which dictate a marked orientational heterogeneity in the binding of the heme (12, 19, 20),

8290 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 23, 1998 as a model system for the study of protein dynamics (21), and as a model system for the study of protein interactions with the heme that controls electrochemical properties (2224). The structural and dynamic properties of both equilibrium forms of cytochrome b5 elucidated in this study provide insights into each of these major areas of interest. The origin of the orientational heterogeneity in the binding of the heme has long been known to be due primarily to a 180° flip about the R,-meso carbon axis of the heme in the binding pocket (5, 25). All structural studies to date have focused on the dominant equilibrium form present in solution referred to as the A form. In this report, we describe the differences between the two equilibrium forms based on high-resolution solution structures of both forms in the rat protein where they exist in nearly equal abundance. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES NMR Samples. Doubly enriched 15N, 13C samples of cytochrome b5 were obtained using an Escherichia. coli expression system as described previously (26). Samples for NMR were prepared in 100 mM phosphate buffer, 10% D2O and 0.5 mM TSP, pH 7.0. The sample was reduced by purging with nitrogen prior to addition of sodium dithionite. A reducing atmosphere was maintained by sealing the NMR tube under reduced nitrogen pressure with a gasoxygen torch. NMR Data Acquisition. All spectra except the HNCO were acquired on a 600 MHz Bruker instrument at 40 °C. The HNCO was acquired on a 500 MHz Varian Unity Plus NMR instrument. The 2D homonuclear NOESY spectra (160 and 200 ms mixing times) were obtained with spectral widths of 8733 Hz in both dimensions. Heteronuclear 3D 15N NOESY-HMQC was acquired with a mixing time of 150 ms. Spectral widths of 3846 Hz in F3 (1H), 1900 Hz in F2 (15N), and 8002 Hz in F1 (1H) were used with 256 real t1, 64 real t2, and 1024 complex data points in F1, F2, and F3, respectively. The HNHA (27) was acquired with a spectral width of 9765 in F3 (1H), 8333 Hz F2 (1H), and 5000 in F1 (15N) with 2048 × 160 × 100 (complex) data points. The HCCH-TOCSY (28) was collected with a spectral width of 8389 Hz in the directly detected 1H dimension, 8401 Hz in the indirectly detected 1H (F2), and 6097 Hz in 13C dimension. The data consisted of 1024 × 256 × 96 complex points. The CBCA(CO)NH was collected

The HNCO was acquired with a gradientenhanced version of the sequence described by Ikura et al. (30) with a spectral width of 8003 Hz in F3 (1H), 2112 Hz in F2 (13C), and 2200 Hz in F1 (15N). The HNCO was sensitivity enhanced in the 15N dimension, and the acquired data contained 1024 × 100 × 80 complex points. The HCACO was acquired using a gradient-enhanced version of the sequence described by Ikura et al. (30) with a spectral width of 8389 Hz in F3 (1H), 5000 Hz in F2 (13CR), and 2500 Hz in F1 (13C). The HCACO was collected as a constant time experiment and sensitivity enhanced in 13CR with a digitization of 1024 × 128 × 128. The DQF-COSY was collected with 4096 × 1024 complex points with spectral widths of 8992 in both dimensions. Deuterium-exchange experiments were carried out by dissolving the protein in D2O and recording HSQC spectra (31) at regular intervals (e.g. 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, and 32 h). The spectra used for analysis of relaxation parameters consisted of gradient-enhanced, inverse detected 2D HSQC spectra (32) recorded with 2048 × 256 complex data points and spectral widths of 8992 Hz in 1H and 2500.01 Hz in the 15N dimension. The relaxation delays used for T1 inversion recovery were 10, 90, 200, 340, 480, 680, 970, and 1300 ms. The relaxation delays used for the T2 experiments were 8.1, 16.3, 32.6, 48.9, 65.2, 81.4, 105.9, and 138.4 ms. The heteronuclear NOE (32) spectra were acquired in an interleaved manner with a 3 s NOE build-up period for the NOE component of the experiment. Proton chemical shifts were determined relative to an internal TSP (trimethylsilylproprionic acid) reference. Carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 chemical shifts were referenced as described by Wishart et al. (33). NMR Data Processing. All NMR data were processed on Silicon Graphics workstations running Irix 5.3. The 2D NOESY and the 3D NOESY-HMQC were processed using Felix version 2.3 (Biosym Software) as described preivously (34). All other data were processed using nmrPipe software (35). The HNHA was processed with a cosine bell window function in all three dimensions. The HCCH-TOCSY was also processed in a similar way with a cosine bell window function in all three dimensions. The time-domain data was zero filled in all three dimensions. In addition, the indirectly detected dimensions were extended using linear prediction to give a final matrix size of 1024 × 1024 × 512 (1H,1H,13C). The CBCA(CO)NH spectrum was zero filled to give a final matrix of 2048 × 256 × 256 points. The DQFCOSY was processed with a cosine bell function in both dimensions and zero filled to give a final matrix size of 4096 × 1024 data points. The HSQC spectra used for the relaxation analysis were processed with zero filling in both dimensions and linear prediction in the sensitivity-enhanced dimension to give a final matrix size of 2048 × 512 real points. Structure Calculations. Structure calculations were performed using DIANA version 2.1 (36). FELIX 95.0 was used for database management of the NOE cross-peaks in the 2D NOESY and the 3D NOESY-HMQC. The 3D 1H, 15N, and 13C NOESY was used only to determine if a particular NOE cross-peak contained multiple contributors. The program CALIBA was used for calibration of NOE intensities. Corrections to the cross-peak intensities were

Structural and Dynamic Analyses of Cytochrome b5 applied to account for the presence of the two equilibrium conformations. The HNHA was used to generate angular constraints for the range of . This was based on the ratio of the cross-peak to diagonal peak intensity for a given HR and HN pair. This ratio was used to calculate the JHNHA which in turn was used to calculate  from the Karplus equation (27). The DQF-COSY was used in combination with intra and interresidue NOE intensities to assign prochiral protons where possible (37). Within the DIANA suite of programs, stereospecific assignments are made in an automated manner using the supporting programs HABAS and GLOMSA. The CBCA(CO)NH and HCCH-TOCSY spectra were used to obtain aliphatic 13C assignments. The CR assignemts were subjected to a Wishart-Sykes analysis for a preliminary prediction of possible secondary structure elements. Deuterium-exchange rates were used to judge the existence of possible hydrogen bonds. Finally, the NOE distance restraints, the  angle restraints, and the hydrogen bond restraints were used as input for structure calculations. A complete listing of restraints is contained in supplementary Table S-2. Complete REDAC runs were carried out for both the A and the B conformations generating 150 structures during each run. The REDAC runs were performed iteratively until the target functions converged to a minimum value (36). The final structures showed no restraint violations and their quality was assessed with the program PROCHECK-NMR (38). Analysis of Relaxation Parameters. The HSQC spectra were analyzed using nmrPipe software (35). The peak heights were analyzed using nmrPipe assuming a Gaussian line shape. The relaxation rate constants were then determined by a nonlinear least-squares fit of the experimental peak heights to two parameter single exponential functions. Experimental uncertainties in the measurement of relaxation times were determined from the measurement of replicates of several time points. Errors in the T1 and T2 values were estimated by the Monte Carlo type procedures which involve randomly adding or subtracting a number corresponding to the root-mean-square spectral noise from the measured intensities (39). The heteronuclear NOE was calculated as the ratio of the peak heights with and without proton saturation. A correction factor was applied to compensate for the incomplete recovery of magnetization during the relaxation delay as described by Grzesiek and Bax (40). Model free analysis of the R1, R2, and NOE values was performed using the software ModelFree version 3.1 (39). Isotropic and anisotropic models were considered for evaluating the relaxation data. The data were first evaluated assuming an isotropic model using the model-free formalism of Lipari and Szabo (41, 42). In this approach, the relaxation parameters are related to the spectral density function as described by Abragam (43). The spectral density function is then modeled as a sum of Lorentzian terms in which the parameters used for describing the dynamic motions of the protein are a generalized order parameter, S 2, correlation times for fast internal motion and global reorientation, e, m, and chemical exchange, Rex. Further S 2 can be considered on a slow time scale (Ss2) or on a fast one (Sf 2) (39). Five models were considered for fitting the experimental data: (1) S 2, (2) S 2, e, (3) S 2, Rex, (4) S 2, e, Rex, and (5) Sf 2, S 2, and e. The selection of a model for a particular residue was based on statistical criteria

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 23, 1998 8291 as previsouly described (39). This analysis yielded fits to 67% of the total number of residues examined. A total of 91 residues were examined. Criteria for rejection of peaks for further consideration was based on NOE values (e.g., less than 0.6), overlap of heteronuclear correlation peaks or statistically significant differences in T1 and T2 from mean values for the protein which are indicative of slow exchange processes (44). The inability to fit a significant fraction of ther remaining amide vector motions was presumed to be due to the marked physical asymmetry of cytochrome b5. The programs pdbinertia·1.0 and quadric·1.0 were used to judge the anisotropy of the system. Different diffusional models were examined using the program R2R1·1.1. The results showed that an anisotropic model would be the best descriptor for the case of the cytochrome b5 system. The model-free analysis was carried out again with an individual correlation time for each residue which is expected for a system that exhibits anisotropic diffusion model. The individual correlation times to be used for each residue were calculated by using the program R2R1·1.1, which uses the R2 by R1 ratios for each residue to determine an estimate of the global correlation time for a particular amide vector (27). The individual m values can also be obtained by optimizing the m for each residue by performing a grid search methodology in the model-free program. The results for the m values in the two cases were very similar. The final model-free analyses showed that the difference in the S 2 values for the isotropic and anisotropic models were not significantly different, although an additional 19% of the total number of residues examined was fitted using the anisotropic model. In the final analysis, 76 amide vectors were satisfactorily modeled based on statistical criteria. A statistically significant improvement in fit quality was found with an axially symmetric diffusion tensor model for the global molecular motion of cytochrome b5. RESULTS Sequence Specific and Conformation Specific Assignments. Complete unambiguous assignment of 13C, 15N, and 1H resonances were based on a set of double and triple resonance experiments. A complete listing of 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments is contained in Supporting Information Table S-1. Although the vast majority of our 15N and 1H resonance assignments (6) were confirmed, as indicated in Figure 1, there were some startling exceptions. Through bond linkage to the previously assigned R-protons of G41 is shown in Figure 2 in a 2D section of the HNHA. The R-protons had been previsously assigned based on ringcurrent calculations and the presence of a peak in the DQFCOSY, which was characteristic of a glycine R,R crosspeak at 0.37 and 3.37 ppm (6). Unambiguous assignment of the amide proton of G41 to a resonance at 1.04 ppm for the A form (1.10 ppm for the B form) was established by connectivies observed in the CBCACONH spectrum shown in Figure 3. This is the highest field amide proton resonance assigned to date. Totally unambiguous side-chain assignments confirming this assignment path and for the majority of the residues in the protein were obtained from highly resolved complete proton ladders observed in HCCH TOCSY spectra (See Figure 4). On the basis of these methods, all protein resonances of the four helix bundle binding the heme

group were assigned. Once we had this complete set of assignments, assignment of the only remaining protons unassigned on the heme cofactor became unambiguous. NOESY connectivities between the methylene protons of the propionates and adjacent protons on the heme and to surrounding residues enabled assignment of these protons. Chemical shift values for the R-methylene protons were observed at 4.12 ppm, and the chemical shift of the -methylene protons were observed at 3.10 ( ) and 2.93 ppm ( ). The chemical shift values for these sets of protons were virtually degenerate for both propionates; however, the  resonance is significantly different in A and B forms. Chemical shifts of the propionate protons are similar to those

recently reported for a monomeric diamagnetic hemoglobin (45) and are consistent with averages of values reported for heme proteins recently compiled by Banci et al. (46). Structure Calculations. Structure calculations were performed for the soluble heme-binding domain of cytochrome b5. Residues 1-94 were considered. Residues 1-3 and residues 87-94 belong to unstructured domains of the protein (3). Structure calculations were carried out using 1218 distance restraints for the A conformation and 1152 distance restraints for the B conformation. This amounts to approximately 15 restraints per assigned, structured residue, not including the dihedral angle described below. The type of restraints classified as intraresidue, medium range, and long range are outlined in Figure 5. A chemical shift analysis of the CR 13C chemical shifts was performed using the Wishart-Sykes method (47). The results are shown in Figure 6. Restraints for 70  angles were calculated from the HNHA. Deuterium-exchange rates were calculated for the amide protons of the A and B conformers. These rates were assigned arbitrarily into three categories; fast exchanging (less than 10 min), intermediate exchanging (10 min to 10 h), and slow exchanging (greater than 10 h) results are shown in Figure 7. The amide protons which were in the slowexchange category were considered for involvement in hydrogen bonds by comparison with the consistent hydrogen bonds as reported by the structure calculation program. A total of 70 such hydrogen bonds were used to generate distance constraints between the amide proton and a hydrogen bond acceptor with an upper bound of 2.4 Å and a lower

bound of 1.5 Å (48). The final structure calculations showed no restraint violations greater than 0.4 Å and yielded an RMSD for backbone atoms of 0.5 Å for both the conformations. An overlay of the top 20 structures is shown in Figure 8. An analysis of the ensemble of the top 20 structures for each conformation was performed using PROCHECK-NMR. The Ramachandran distribution is shown for the A and the B conformers in Figure 9. The distribution of the  and  angles for both the conformers is indicative of the quality of structures calculated. Both the A and the B conformer show more than 74% of the residues in the most favorable region, indicating structures equivalent to a 2 Å resolution X-ray structure. A Ramachandran plot for the average structure indicated that 80% of the residues were in the core region and 20% were in the allowed regions. None of the residues were seen to lie in the disallowed regions for either the A or the B form of the protein. Analysis of Residues in the Heme Binding Region. Unique restraints for the A and the B form were observable from the heme to the surrounding residues. As we have previously indicated, these NOESY connectivities are the primary basis of conformation specific assignment (7). The heteronuclear methods added confidence to our previous assignments by providing unambiguous through-bond linkages establishing all resonances associated with a given spin system. The number of long-range restraints from the heme group to the

protein for the A and the B conformers were 43 and 30, respectively. Unique restraints for the A and the B conformers were also identifiable for almost all residues in the heme binding region (W22-Y74). A planar heme geometry was used in the final structures reported here. Structures calculated using the nonplanar heme geometry reported by Mathews (3) for the A form of the bovine protein did not show any significant differences in structure quality or structural features from the geometry calculated using a planar heme. The ability to discern distortions from a planar heme geometry is clearly a significant advantage of X-ray crystallographic methods. A superior number of long-range restraints for the residues in the heme-binding region enabled us to characterize the geometry of residues more precisely than has earlier been reported (11). This has been possible through the use of heteronuclear NMR techniques described in greater detail below. The geometry of the axial ligands, His39 and His63, was extremely well-defined through over 75 restraints for both the A and the B conformers. Almost 40% of these restraints were long range, and this enabled determination of the relative orientation of the axial ligands with respect to the surrounding residues and the heme moiety. An overlay of the X-ray structure (3b5c) with the A and B conformers did not indicate any significant differences in the backbone geometry for either the A or the B form of the protein. A comparison of the A and B conformers revealed that the

backbone geometry was largely the same for both and that the rmsd for the backbone between the two conformers was 0.8 Å. Small differences are evident between the two conformations in the region of helix 3, as can be seen in the overlay of the average structures shown in Figure 11. The primary focus of this study was to examine differences between the two conformers, which in turn would provide insight into factors controling heme electroreactivity and the differing thermodynamic stability of the two conformers. Some of the surprising differences observed between the two conformers are outlined below. Figure 11A contains an overlay of the average structure for both A and B conformors, highlighting differences between them. A 5-10° in plane rotation in addition to the ring flip has previously been suggested (6, 19). This conclusion was based on a limited set of NOEs from the surrounding residues to the heme prosthetic group. Although within the limits of uncertainty observed, this 5-10° in-plane rotation is indeed possible, an additional unexpected feature was the observed heme ring displacement from the heme cavity toward the solvent in the B form by nearly an angstrom. The position of the heme ring in the two conformers is very well-defined and the standard deviation of the Fe center found in the rms overlay of backbone structures in both the conformations is 0.2 Å. The average inplane displacement of the heme iron between the two structures is 0.9 Å. Thus, our statistical confidence in this displacement, given two sets of 20 structures, is greater than 95% based on a Student's t-analysis of the difference between the two means (49). Figure 11B illustrates this shift

through an overlay of the hemes taken from the rms overlay of the backbone structures shown in Figure 11A. Some other differences in the B conformation were the possibility of angular displacement of His 39 from the normal to heme plane similar to the observation in the A67V mutant (34). This effect could play an important role in modulating the electrochemical properties of the heme center; however, the magnitude of the imidazole reorientation is significantly smaller between the A and B conformers than that we observed between the wild-type and the A67V mutant. Another very important observation in the B form is the absence of a hydrogen bond between the main-chain amide proton of Ser 64B and the heme propionate. This hydrogen bond was, however, seen in the A form of the protein. This hydrogen bond has not been reported in the recently published solution structure of the major form of rat cytochrome b5 (11). The assignment of this hydrogen bond which is observed in the bovine crystal structure is based on three lines of evidence. Structure calculations performed by Diana 2.1 reported the formation of a consistent hydrogen bond between the heme propionate and the amide proton of S64A based on a set of NOEs to the -CH2 protons of the heme propionate-7 (e.g., NOEs observed between the -CH2 of the 7-propionate and the 8-methyl of the heme and the -methyl of A67). The existence of the hydrogen bond is also indicated by a more than 10-fold difference in hydrogenexchange rates between S64A and S64B. Finally, the dynamic analysis indicates a significantly more restricted amide bond vector in S64A relative to S64B. This difference

corresponds to an increased range of angular movement of the S64 amide vector by 4.5° assuming a model of the motion in which the amide vector is free to move about within a conical domain (41). Although both the vinyl and propionate group dihedral angles were free to rotate, the final geometry of the heme group showed that the vinyl groups retained the geometry in the crystal structure while the propionate groups were more flexible. Dynamics of Cytochrome b5. (1) Deuterium-Exchange Rates and Mobility. An analysis of deuterium-exchange rates was performed for ferrocytochrome b5 and are represented in Figure 7. Residues which showed deuterium-exchange rates less than 10 min or could not be accurately quantitated due to spectral overlap are not shown in the figure. Most of the residues which showed deuterium-exchange rates faster than 10 min were confined to the N- and C-termini. Other residues which showed fast deuterium-exchange rates were located in R1 and R3, 3, and regions on the surface of the molecule. These regions were seen to be dynamic in the molecular dynamics simulations as well and thus these enhanced exchange rates may correlate with certain breathing modes of the protein (21).

(2) Relaxation Rates. T1, T2, and heteronuclear NOE values were calculated based on peak heights determined from Gaussian line shape fits to the heteronuclear correlation peaks. Single two parameter exponential fits were used in the determination of T1 and T2. Figure 12 contains a plot of the amplitudes of these relaxation parameters plotted as a function of residue number for the A conformer. The dimensions of cytochrome b5 determined from the X-ray and solution structure indicate an ellipsoidal shape. The program inertia·1.0, distributed with the Modelfree 3.1 suite of programs, revealed that the relative moments of inertia were 0.6472:0.8794:1.0000. The R2/R1 ratio was used to calculate the appropriate m for each residue. These values corroborated the values obtained from the Modelfree program which was used to optimize the m for each residue.

model-free version 3.1 was used to obtain S 2 and e values given individual optimized m values for each residue. The choice of the best diffusional model for cytochrome b5 was based on the improvement in fit quality using an F-test comparing critical values at the 95% confidence level (See Table 1). The S 2 values for the various residues are tabulated in Supporting Information Table S-3. The average S 2 value for the system was 0.87 indicating a relatively rigid system. The analysis was carried out for both the A and B conformations. The majority of the residues showed similar behavior in terms of S 2. Table 4 contains a listing of residues which display signficant differences. DISCUSSION The Origin of Differences in Electrochemical Properties. Several theories exist regarding protein heme interactions which modulate cytochrome reduction potentials. The effects of axial imidazole orientation (51), hydrogen bonding to the

axial imidazoles (52, 53) and the effects of charge distributions in the vicinity of the heme (54) are currently thought to be the most significant effectors. The magnitude of each of these effects has been evaluated with regard to differences observed between the two equilibrium conformations. As indicated in our previous studies of rat cytochrome b5, the strengths of hydrogen bonds between the axial imidazoles and main-chain carbonyl atoms are not significantly different in the two conformers as is indicated by the similarity in the chemical shifts of imidazole N1 proton and 15N resonances (24). Similarly, based on a comparison of the structures calculated for both the A and B conformations, it would appear that axial imidazole ring reorientation is much smaller than that we have observed in a mutational study which was designed to perturb the ring orientation (34). However, the one significant difference, other than the displacement of the heme out of the binding pocket by nearly an angstrom, is the observation of a hydrogen bond between one of the heme propionates and the S64 amide in the A form and not the B form. On the basis of the X-ray crystal structures of both oxidized and reduced states, Mathews et al. (3) proposed that the structures of the oxidized and reduced protein of cytochrome b5 are virtually identical except for a cation that binds to the propionate group in the reduced protein to neutralize the negative charge. It is believed that when cytochrome b5 is in the ferric state, the iron atom has a formal charge of +1. This charge is controlled by the conformation of the heme propionates, since it is believed that these groups play an important role in neutralizing this charge. In the bovine protein, S64 plays an important role in orienting one of the heme propionates by forming two hydrogen bonds, one with the main-chain amide and the other with the sidechain hydroxyl group. A number of mutagenic (23), chemical modification (55), and crystallographic studies (23) have revealed that this hydrogen bonding plays an important role in modulating the electrochemical properties of the heme center. A study of the S64A mutant of cytochrome b5

showed that this alanine mutant had a lower reduction potential. It was believed that this was primarily due to the inability of this mutant to form a hydrogen bond with the heme propionate. This allowed the heme propionate to stabilize the +1 charge at the iron center in the oxidized protein which, in turn, corresponded to a lower reduction potential. We have made a similar observation in comparing the structures of A and B forms of rat cytochrome b5. Although the A conformer showed the hydrogen bond with the S64HN, the B conformer did not. This was presumably due primarily due to the positional shift of the heme ring in the binding pocket. This observation correlates well with the lower reduction potential of the B conformtation (27 mV lower than that of the A) in that the propionate is more available to stabilize the positive charge of the iron in the oxidized state if it is not tied up with a hydrogen bond to the S64 amide (23). Thus, the rat system has proved to be an ideal system where one can correlate structural changes between conformational states to differences in reduction potential through the use of heteronuclear NMR methods. Differences in the Thermodynamic Stability of the A and B Conformers. A number of studies have also implicated

the heme propionates in controlling the ratio of the conformational isomers in myoglobin and cytochrome b5 (56, 57). This ratio has been correlated to the degree of hydrogen bonding possible and the kinetics of heme dissociation. The existence of a hydrogen bond stabilizes heme binding and improves thermodynamic stability of the conformation, as is indicated by a preference for one equilibrium conformation over the other. Comparisons between species variants have also implicated a cluster of hydrophobic residues in contact with the 2-vinyl group of the heme in the B form which presumably detabilizes the heme binding. It is now clear from the detailed study of the structures of the two conformers that both of these effects are correlated. Steric interactions of the 2-vinyl group of the heme in the B conformation are the principle cause of the heme displacement out of the heme-binding cavity which then prevents the formation of the hydrogen bond between the S64 amide and the heme propionate. Recently, mutagenic studies have implicated residue 74 (residue 74 is a phenylalanine in the bovine protein and a tyrosine in the rat protein) in modulating the equilibrium ratio of conformational states. We believe this role may be mediated by orienting F35 in its interaction with

the heme. Both F35 and F58 stabilize the heme binding through hydrophobic aromatic overlap with the heme ring system. The 0.9 Å displacement out of the heme pocket reduces this overlap substantially and, hence, presumably reduces the thermodynamic stability of heme binding. It is important to note that in virtually all other species variants of cytochrome b5 the residue at position 23 is a leucine or an isoleucine (3) (in the rat protein it is a valine). As can be seen from Figure 14, residues V23, L25, and L46 form a tight cleft on which the 2-vinyl group in the B form sits. If V23 is replaced with a leucine, this cleft is presumably reduced in volume and the heme would be even further

displaced out of the binding pocket further reducing the thermodynamic stability of the B form in these other species variants as is observed. Comparisons with Other Structures. An overlay of the backbone of the X-ray structure and the solution structure is shown in Figure 10. An rmsd of about 1.0 Å was observed between the bovine crystal structure and the rat solution structure for both the conformations (backbone atoms CR, carbonyl, and amide N). Recently, a large number of groups have investigated differences in the secondary structural elements of the X-ray structure with the solution structures of various species variants. A comparison of the quality of these structural analyses is contained in Table 2. Pairwise rmsd calculations were performed between the solution structures of both the A and B forms reported here and the recently reported structure of the A form reported by Banci et al. (11), the bovine X-ray crystal structure, and the solution structure of the oxidized bovine protein (10). Other recently reported solution structure analyses have heavily relied on analysis of homonuclear data (15N data was used in the analysis of the oxidized bovine solution structure). Our ability to double label cytochrome b5 has enabled us to obtain 13C assignments for most of the aliphatic carbons. Tables

for these assignments are available in Supporting Information (see Table S-1). A Wishart-Sykes analysis can be performed for the HR, CR, and the CO chemical shifts and has been used extensively as a predictor of secondary structural elements (47, 58). In the case of cytochrome b5, we were restricted to the use of 13C chemical shifts since proton chemical shifts are strongly influenced by proximity to the heme system. For example, as indicated above, glycine 41A, which has the HN proton closest to heme group, shows a chemical shift at around 1.0 ppm. The HR protons of this G41 are at 3.37 and 0.37 ppm. The random coil chemical shift for a glycine R-proton is 3.95 ppm and that of the amide proton is 8.39 ppm (59). These ring-current shifts preclude the possibility of using HR chemical shifts for chemical shift refinement. An analysis of the 13CR chemical shifts is shown in Figure 6. An analysis of the  and  angles of the top 20 structures of A and B conformations was also performed. The average  and  angles for the ensemble of structures were analyzed in order to evaluate ranges of secondary structural elements. The criteria used was based on ranges used for prediction of secondary structure by Daggett and Levitt (60). Most of the secondary structural elements were consistent with those observed in related solution structures. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on cytochrome b5 have shown that R1, R3, R4, 1, and 4 are the most stable secondary structure elements (21). A Wishart-Sykes analysis of the 13C chemical shifts could succcessfully predict the presence of R1, R3 R4, R5, and R6. However, the R2 strand indicated in the crystal structure was found to be irregular. This observation is consistent with previously reported NMR structures (10, 11, 14). As far as the -strands were concerned, 1 and 4, which were predicted to be the most

stable -strands by the molecular dynamics simulation, could be unambiguously predicted from the chemical shift analysis. Recent structural studies carried out on the oxidized and reduced forms of the protein were not able to successfully predict the presence of 1. The rest of the secondary structure analysis was largely consistent with previously reported data. The backbone rmsd of the A form of the protein versus the B form was found to be 0.5 A. The secondary structural elements were largely unperturbed in the B form of the protein. Dynamics of Cytochrome b5. A number of groups have recently studied dynamics of redox proteins in more than one oxidation state either theoretically (61, 62) or based on deuterium exchange (63). Certain proteins are believed to undergo significant structural reorganization when going from one redox state to another (63, 64). The reorganizational energy involved in this process may play an important role in the rate of electron transfer. Recent structural studies on oxidized (14) and reduced cytochrome b5 (11) reveal that only minute differences exist between the two states consistent with the X-ray crystallographic characterization of both oxidation states for the bovine protein (3). Dynamic studies have also been performed for 55 residues of the major form of the oxidized form of bovine cytochrome b5, assuming an isotropic model (4). Here, we have analyzed 76 of the 94 residues of both equilibrium forms of reduced rat cytochrome b5. The results indicate that the reduced form of cytochrome b5 is a more rigid system [e.g., our average squared order parameter is 0.87 while that reported by Kelly et al. (4) has an average of 0.8]. We have also completed a careful comparison of the dynamics of both oxidation states of rat cytochrome b5 examining the effects of the paramag-

a The table shows the ratio of the time constants for deuterium exchange (A/B) for residues of ferrocytochrome b5. The time constants for each residue were obtained by fitting peak heights in 15N-edited HSQC spectra (obtained at intervals of 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, and 32 h) to an exponential decay function using Excel. The average error in the determination of these deuterium exchange time constants was 3%. This error was determined by carrying out the experiment in duplicate.

The reduced 2 is normalized to the number of degrees of freedom in the measurement. b For 76 measured values and one parameter in the fit versus three parameters in the fit for the axial case, the critical value for the F-statistic at a 95% confidence interval is 3.14 (49).

netism on the relaxation rates at mulitple fields, and the results will be presented in a subsequent paper (65). Certain differences do exists in the deuterium-exchange rates and the backbone dynamics of the A and the B conformers. The residues showing significant differences in the deuterium-exchange rates and the S 2 values are indicated in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Perhaps surprisingly, although there are differences in the magnitudes of both the order parameters and deuterium-exchange rates, they do not correlate strongly. No obvious correlation between regions of high dynamic mobility observed in molecular dynamics simulations of cytochrome b5 (21) have been observed with the order parameters, but many of the reported fluctuations in the structure of cytochrome b5 were on relatively long time scales and may not be well sampled by the 15N relaxation analyses.

Deuterium-exchange studies are more suited to such long time scale structure fluctuations. Among the helices that form the four helix bundle, helix 3 has the fastest deuteriumexchange rate, consistent with long-time scale and perhaps low-frequency conformational changes predicted by the molecular dynamics analyses. Fluctuations in the position of helix 3 which contains two residues implicated in interprotein recognition could play an important role in cytochrome b5's ability to interact with several different electron-transfer partners.
