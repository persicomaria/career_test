The second structure of a eukaryotic RNA polymerase II so far determined, that of the enzyme from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is reported here. Comparison with the previous structure of the enzyme from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals differences in regions implicated in start site selection and transcription factor interaction. These aspects of the transcription mechanism differ between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, but are conserved between S. pombe and humans. Amino acid changes apparently responsible for the structural differences are also conserved between S. pombe and humans, suggesting that the S. pombe structure may be a good surrogate for that of the human enzyme.

-ray crystal structures of RNA polymerases from bacteria and Archaea, and of RNA polymerase II (pol II) from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have given insight into the fundamental mechanism of transcription (1­7). The structures are closely similar in the catalytic core of the enzyme, where mobile elements interact with nucleic acids during transcription. The bacterial and S. cerevisiae structures differ in the periphery, where the enzymes interact with accessory factors, most notably the general transcription factors and Mediator of eukaryotes. One of the general factors, transcription factor II B (TFIIB), exhibits a degree of conservation with bacterial sigma factor and has a counterpart in Archaea, and a subunit of another general factor, the TATA-binding protein, occurs in Archaea as well, but the remaining general factors and Mediator are unique to eukaryotes. Conserved elements of the catalytic core include ``switch regions'' at the base of a swinging clamp, which interact with the DNA­RNA hybrid and downstream DNA during transcription (2, 3) and may be involved in transcription start site determination (8, 9). A so-called ``trigger loop'' interacts with the substrate nucleoside triphosphate to achieve the high fidelity of transcription (10­14). A ``bridge helix'' interacts with the coding base in the template strand of the DNA and is believed to play a role in the translocation step of transcription. Peripheral, more divergent elements of pol II include subunits Rpb4 and Rpb7, which form a dimer protruding from the enzyme surface (15, 16) and may be involved in RNA binding. Nearby lies the C terminus of Rpb1, from which extends a flexible linker, followed by 20 repeats of a 7-aa sequence [the C-terminal domain (CTD)], which interact not only with Mediator but also with capping, splicing, and cleavage/polyadenylation factors during transcription (17). Pol II is 53% identical in amino acid sequence between S. cerevisiae and humans, assuring a high degree of structural similarity. Notable differences in transcription have nevertheless emerged, including differences in promoter structure and interactions with accessory factors. In these respects, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe more closely resembles the human system. Promoter DNA melting and other properties are more similar between S. pombe and human cells (18). The transcription start site is located 30 bp downstream of the TATA box in S. pombe and humans, whereas it varies from 40 to 120 bp

downstream in S. cerevisiae (19). TFIIB has been implicated in start site selection (20­23), and human TFIIB can substitute for endogenous TFIIB in S. pombe, whereas S. cerevisiae TFIIB cannot (24). The Rpb4/Rpb7 dimer is stoichiometric in S. pombe and human. In contrast only 20% is bound during exponential phase in S. cerevisiae (25). Structure determination of human pol II has so far been limited to the individual subunits Rpb6 and Rpb8 by NMR and to the Rpb4/Rpb7 dimer by X-ray crystallography (26­28). Inasmuch as the entire human and other mammalian enzymes have resisted attempts at crystallization, the structure of S. pombe pol II is of particular interest. It can provide a basis for understanding mammalian pol II transcription, a platform for assembly and structure determination of complexes with accessory factors. We have previously formed 2D crystals of S. pombe pol II and obtained electron density maps in projection at low resolution (29). We now report the formation of large single crystals and structure determination by X-ray analysis. Results S. pombe pol II crystallized in space group P212121 with 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by

Green spheres represent -amanitin.

for possible contact with the downstream DNA. The Rpb1 ``clamp head,'' which can be cross-linked to TFIIE in S. cerevisiae (30), adopted a different conformation in S. pombe (Fig. 2). Loop 4­ 5, only partially ordered in S. cerevisiae, could be built in S. pombe, and its position, together with a shift of 15 Å of the clamp head tip, resulted in a more open conformation. On the Rpb2 side of the cleft, a series of loops protruding from the ``lobe'' domain had different conformations in S. pombe. Loop 9­ 10, which can be cross-linked to TFIIF in S. cerevisiae (30), and loop 7­ 8 were shifted toward downstream DNA in S. pombe. Fork loop 2, only seen in its entirety in S. cerevisiae after an advanced refinement approach (31), could be completely built in S. pombe, in a location where it would block the path of the nontemplate DNA strand in a transcribing complex, and thus contribute to the formation of the downstream edge of the transcription bubble (3, 32). Another difference in surface conformation was in the Rpb1 ``dock domain,'' where TFIIB was bound in a previous cocrystal with pol II (20). A helix in S. cerevisiae adopted a loop conformation in S. pombe that was shifted in the direction of TFIIB (Fig. 3A). His-424Ser-418 (S. cerevisiae residue in superScript) in the tip of the loop, in close proximity to TFIIB, is conserved in humans, but replaced by a serine in S. cerevisiae.
Switches 1 and 2. Whereas Rpb1 switches 1 and 2 were only ordered in the presence of DNA and RNA in an S. cerevisiaeSpåhr et al.

transcribing complex (3), both switches were well ordered in the S. pombe structure (Fig. 3B). A short helix in switch 1, 47a, adopted a loop conformation in S. pombe, pointing toward the location of DNA in the transcribing complex (Fig. 3C). This conformation was made possible by movement of Tyr-842Tyr-836 of the bridge helix and was stabilized by Met-1388Thr-1382, Ile-1390Val-1384, and Ile-1395Phe-1389, which positioned Arg1392Arg-1386 and His-1393His-1387 for DNA contact (Fig. 3C). The stabilizing residues are conserved in human pol II, but differ in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 3D). In switch 2, 4 residues in the middle of -helix 10 were flipped out and shifted 4.5 Å, compared with all S. cerevisiae structures (Fig. 3B). The flipped-out region was in close proximity to the B finger in the pol II­TFIIB cocrystal structure (20) and contained the conserved residue Lys-338Lys-332 shown to shift the transcription start site downstream upon mutation in S. cerevisiae (9). Mutations in switch 1 have been shown to shift the transcription start site downstream as well (8).

for the entire Rpb1 trigger loop in the S. pombe structure (Fig. 4A). In contrast, continuous density was only observed for the trigger loop in S. cerevisiae in a transcribing complex (13) or in the presence of TFIIS (32). The conformation in S. pombe was

intermediate between those in the 2 previous S. cerevisiae structures (Fig. 4B). The S. pombe conformation was stabilized by interactions with the bridge helix and Rpb1 loop 23­ 24, helix 21, strand 32, strand 33, loop 20 ­ 21, and loop 37­ 27. Helix 36, immediately adjacent to the trigger loop, was 1 turn longer in the S. pombe structure. Tyr-1089Phe-1086 of the trigger loop made contacts with Rpb1 residues Glu-774Glu-768, Ile-775Ser-769, and Arg-732Arg-726 (Fig. 4 C and D). An additional contact was formed between Val-1092Val-1089 of the trigger loop and Rpb1 residue Gly-778Gly-772. Tyr-1089Phe-1086 is conserved in humans, but replaced by a phenylalanine in S. cerevisiae; indeed, the entire trigger loop sequence is more similar between S. pombe and humans than between either and S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4D). The bridge helix was helical along its entire length (Fig. 4E), with a kink at a position previously seen in an S. cerevisiae transcribing complex in the presence of -amanitin (33), and shifted 1 turn with respect to a transcribing complex with bound GTP (13). The kink in the presence of -amanitin was apparently stabilized by the trigger loop wedged between Rpb1 helix 37 and the bridge helix (33). In S. pombe, however, the kink was observed in the same position despite a different location of the trigger loop (Fig. 4F). Binding of -amanitin in S. pombe would be expected to disrupt interaction between the trigger loop and

Rpb4/Rpb7 Dimer. The sequence similarity of Rpb7 among S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, and humans was high, whereas the sequence similarity of Rpb4 was considerably lower (Fig. 5A). The structure of the Rpb4/Rpb7 dimer showed a greater similarity of S. pombe to human than to S. cerevisiae (Fig. 5B). Indeed, Rpb4 was highly similar in structure in S. pombe and human despite the low sequence conservation. Two central insertions present in S. cerevisiae were absent, one containing 11 residues, with a pair of short antiparallel -strands, and a second insertion that in S. cerevisiae contains a 15-residue helix and a flexible unbuilt region, replaced in S. pombe and humans by a loop between helices H1 and H2. The Rpb4/Rpb7 dimer was linked to the rest of pol II through contacts of the N-terminal domain of Rpb7 with Rpb1 and Rpb6 (Fig. 6). Contacts made by the variable Nterminal region of Rpb4 in S. cerevisiae, 14 residues shorter in S. pombe, were lacking. Rpb7 contains 2 RNA binding motifs, an OB fold and a RNP fold, conserved in eukaryotes and Archaea (16, 28, 34). Mutagenesis of the OB fold of human Rpb7 has implicated Ser-109, Arg-151, Asp-153, and Phe-158 in RNA binding (28). These

Materials and Methods
Preparation and Crystallization of Pol II. S. pombe pol II was purified as described (36) and concentrated to 11 mg/mL with change of buffer to 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 M ZnCl2, 10 mM DTT. Crystals were grown at 16 °C by the sessile drop- vapor diffusion method, by adding pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) to 1.2 L of protein at a final concentration of 14.2 mM and mixing with an equal volume of reservoir solution [50 mM Mes (pH 6.3), 300 mM ammonium acetate, 5­ 6.5% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, and 10 mM DTT]. After 9 days, crystals were crushed and microseeded into a fresh drop prepared as before except with Mes, pH 6.6, and 3.6% PEG 4000. After several rounds of microseeding, long rod-shaped crystals (0.1 0.1 0.6 mm) were obtained. The crystals were harvested by transfer in 2 steps over 1 h to mother liquor containing 15­30% glycerol and cryo-coded in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Processing. Diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Radiation Laboratory (Menlo Park, CA) on beamlines 11-1 and 9-2, and at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley, CA) on beamlines 5.0.2 and 8.2.2. Data were processed with MOSFLM (37) and SCALA (38). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (39), using 12-subunit pol II from S. cerevisiae as search model [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1WCM]. The molecular replacement solution was subjected to rigid body refinement with CNS (40) and prime and switch density modification including noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) with Resolve to remove model bias (41). An initial 2Fo Fc map was used for manual fitting and model building in Coot (42). The improved model was subjected to bulk solvent correction, rigid body, group ADP, and TLS refinement with automatic NCS using Phenix (43, 44). Strict NCS was used during all refinement steps after the model built in molecule 1 had been transferred to molecule 2, with the exception of the CTD linker that showed differences in the 2 molecules. After several rounds of manual model building and refinement in Phenix, the final free R factor was lowered to 32.1%. Figures were prepared with Pymol (http://pymol.sourceforge.net). ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

residues are all conserved in S. pombe (Ser-112Thr-111, Arg-152Ile-151, Asp-154Glu-153, and Phe-159His-158), but not in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 5A). They are located adjacent to RNA as it exits the enzyme (Fig. 6). A mutation in the same region of the S. pombe enzyme, G150DG 149 (Figs. 5A and 6), almost abolished transcriptional activity at an elevated temperature (35).
CTD Linker. The last ordered residue of S. cerevisiae Rpb1 was Leu-1450, whereas the S. pombe chain could be traced as far as residue 1497 (Fig. 6). The additional ordered region, which forms part of the linker to the CTD, included a short central helix, followed by a loop stabilized by contact with Rpb4 loop H1­H2. Helix H1, 11/2 turns shorter in S. pombe and humans than in S. cerevisiae, provided a further interaction surface for the linker and contacts with Rpb4 helix H3 were seen as well. Because of crystal packing differences, residues 1460 ­1490 of the second molecule in the asymmetric unit were too f lexible for model building, but clear density for the linker extended to residue 1506, where an additional helix was observed.

Discussion S. pombe and S. cerevisiae differ in the distance from the TATA box to the start site of pol II transcription. Structural differences between the 2 polymerases reported here may be responsible. These differences lie along the path of the DNA in the transcribing enzyme and in sites of interaction with general transcription factors involved in transcription initiation. Where DNA enters the pol II cleft, 3 loops, Rpb1 4 ­ 5, 31­ 43, and 40 ­ 29, become structured in S. pombe, resulting in a different interface for binding the general factors TFIIE and TFIIH, proposed to interact in this region (20, 30). In addition, 2 loops in the Rpb2 lobe domain, 7­ 8 and 9 ­ 10, are shifted toward downstream DNA, which may

affect pol II binding to TFIIF. Further along the cleft, the switch regions, important for binding the DNA­RNA hybrid, and start site selection (3, 8, 9), are structured in the absence of DNA in S. pombe, but not in S. cerevisiae. TFIIB, also important for start site selection, interacts with the pol II dock domain, which differs in structure between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae as well. S. pombe pol II displays additional structured regions not observed in the S. cerevisiae enzyme. The CTD linker could be seen in S. pombe pol II following a path along Rpb4 toward the OB fold of Rpb7, which may bind RNA as it exits from the enzyme. The trigger loop was also seen in its entirety in the free enzyme, whereas it was only fully structured in S. cerevisiae in a transcribing complex in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate. Amino acid residues important for these structural differences between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae are conserved between S. pombe and humans. Residues stabilizing switch 1, residues of the trigger loop, and residues in the OB fold all exhibit such conservation. Because S. pombe resembles the human system in start site location and other respects, this conservation further suggests that functional differences with the S. cerevisiae system are caused by the structural differences observed. The conservation also indicates the value of the S. pombe pol II structure as a model for the human enzyme.
