IMMUNOLOGY

Invariant CD3 subunit dimers (CD3 , CD3 , and CD3 ) are the signaling components of the T cell receptor (TCR). The recently solved structure of murine CD3 revealed a unique side-to-side interface and central -sheets conjoined between the two C2-set Ig-like ectodomains, with the pairing of the parallel G strands implying a potential concerted piston-type movement for signal transduction. Although CD3 and CD3 each dimerize with CD3 , there are differential CD3 subunit requirements for receptor assembly and signaling among T lineage subpopulations, presumably mandated by structural differences. Here we present the solution structure of the heterodimeric CD3 complex. Whereas the CD3 subunit conformation is virtually identical to that in CD3 , the CD3 ectodomain adopts a C1-set Ig fold, with a narrower GFC front face -sheet that is more parallel to the ABED back face than those -sheets in CD3 and CD3 . The dimer interface between CD3 and CD3 is highly conserved among species and of similar character to that in CD3 . Glycosylation sites in CD3 are arranged such that the glycans may point away from the membrane, consistent with a model of TCR assembly that allows the CD3 chain to be in close contact with the TCR -chain. This and many other structural and biological features provide a basis for modeling putative TCR CD3 extracellular domain associations. The fact that the two clusters of transmembrane helices, namely, the three CD3 ­CD3 ­TCR segments and the five CD3 ­ CD3 ­TCR ­CD3 ­CD3 segments, are presumably centered beneath the G strand-paired CD3 heterodimers has important implications for TCR signaling.

terminal -strand elements raised the possibility that concerted piston-type displacement of CD3 upon TCR ligation may be involved in the initiation of T cell signaling (17). Recently, the crystal structure of the human CD3 heterodimer complexed with the Fab fragment of OKT3, a therapeutic mAb, identified a similar architecture (18). Although the CD3 and the CD3 subunits each pair with CD3 , there are differences in CD3 subunit requirements for various T lineage populations and their developmental stages (2, 19­26). For example, pre-TCR and TCR functions are impaired by genetic disruption of CD3 but not CD3 , suggesting that CD3 heterodimers are dispensable for both assembly and surface expression of these receptors but are required for signaling in mature T cells. Pre-TCRs are expressed early in thymic development on the surface of precursors of T cells, T cells represent a separate lineage (27). Moreover, whereas the CD3 heterodimers are explicitly excluded during TCR assembly (19). Unlike CD3 mutant mice, in which thymic development is blocked at the early CD4 CD8 double negative T cell developmental (DN) stage, mice lacking CD3 display arrest at the CD4 CD8 double positive (DP) thymocyte stage (24, 26, 28). Such thymocytes are unable to undergo positive TCR interaction with selection, which normally results from self-pMHC molecules, to facilitate further differentiation into either mature CD4 or CD8 thymocytes, the immediate precursors of helper and cytotoxic T cells, respectively (29). Structural elucidation of the TCR components is a prerequisite to understanding the initial events in the TCR signaling process. This is a daunting task, given the complexity of the TCR components and pMHC ligands as well as the ability of subtle variation in MHC-bound peptides to be detected by the TCR. To further investigate the basis of CD3 function in the TCR, we have focused on the structural determination of the CD3 heterodimer, the final missing piece among the extracellular domains. To this end, we have designed a single-chain (sc) CD3 heterodimer ectodomain using Escherichia coli expression and optimized in vitro refolding conditions. Here, we present the solution NMR structure of this scCD3 heterodimer. Together with previously obtained structural and biochemical data, our recent results support a plausible model for the arrangement of the various TCR components and for early T

cell signaling mechanisms linked to thymic selection events and T cell activation. Methods
Cloning, Expression, Refolding, and Purification of CD3 . Covalently linked scCD3 constructs were expressed, refolded, and purified (unpublished results). Briefly, this constructed gene, which encodes a murine CD3 fragment (residue ID 22­100 of SwissProt P22646), a 33-aa flexible linker, and a sheep CD3 fragment (residue ID 23­88 of Swiss-Prot P18438), was cloned into a pET11a expression vector, and recombinant scCD3 proteins were produced as inclusion bodies in E. coli B834(DE3). To find an optimized refolding condition, refolding efficiency in the 16 different conditions of the FoldIt kit (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) was primarily monitored by surface plasmon resonance using the conformation-specific anti-murine CD3 mAb 17A2 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) (30) and confirmed by gel filtration chromatography. The optimal refolding buffer contained 55 mM Mes (pH 6.5), 264 mM NaCl, 11 mM KCl, 2.2 mM MgCl2, 2.2 mM CaCl2, 440 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM reduced glutathione, 1 mM oxidized glutathione, and 0.5 complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After in vitro refolding, soluble and monomeric CD3 proteins were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences).

. The solution structure of scCD3 was determined by NMR spectroscopy using isotopically labeled proteins expressed from E. coli. Standard multidimensional NMR experiments (31) were carried out primarily on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) Avance 500 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe using 0.3 ml of 0.5 mM isotopically samples in buffer (50 mM NaCl 17 mM labeled scCD3 NaPO4, pH 7.4) at 25°C. IBIS software (32) was used in obtaining the backbone NMR assignments. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were obtained by using TALOS software (33) based on assigned 13C chemical shifts. Distance nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) restraints were obtained from 15N- and 13C-separated 3D NOESY as well as conventional 2D NOESY data sets. Hydrogen bond restraints were derived from NOE distance restraints after the initial protein fold was determined to improve convergence of calculated structures. The final NMR structures (Fig. 1A), with statistical results shown in Table 1, were calculated by using X-PLOR software (34). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID code 1XMW). NMR Spectroscopic Studies of scCD3 Modeling TCR CD3 Extracellular Domain Organizations. We searched for plausible docking models for the TCR and CD3 extracellular domains using TREEDOCK software (35) while incorporating known experimental results. The coordinates were taken from an N15 TCR (PDB ID code 1NFD) and the most representative NMR structures of scCD3 (PDB ID code 1JBJ) and scCD3 (PDB ID

code 1XMW). Specifically, for CD3 docking, four residues from the TCR C AB loop within a pocket formed between the TCR C CD and EF loops and the TCR C FG loop were used as docking targets, and the models were further selected to best accommodate an H57 Fab fragmont bound to the TCR C FG loop. CD3 was docked to the TCR -chain by using residues from the constant domain as docking targets, and the models were further selected by avoiding clashes between modeled glycans on TCR and CD3 . The linker residues from CD3 were excluded from these models before docking. A representative model of the associated TCR CD3 extracellular domains was selected visually for preparing the figures.

deviations in the CC loop and EF loop (Fig. 2B) are due to the fact that these loops do not converge well in the CD3 structure but are better defined in the CD3 structure. The CD3 domain, on the other hand, has a different fold than murine CD3 and CD3 , which adopt C2-set Ig folds. The front face of CD3 contains G, F, and C -strands, but not the C strand present in both CD3 and CD3 . This C strand, predicted by sequence alignment (17), is translocated to join the back face, becoming a D strand. Hence, the back face of CD3 contains A, B, E, and D -strands, characteristic of an Ab constant domainlike C1-set fold. The BC loop connecting the two disulfide-linked -sheets of CD3 is extremely short, which is, in part, responsible for the comparatively small Ig domain size (66 residues) (Fig. 1 B and C).
Domain Association of the CD3 Heterodimer. The extracellular domains of CD3 and CD3 in scCD3 associate with each other via their respective G strands, which form a parallel -strand pair with extensive hydrogen bonds (Figs. 1B and 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), in a manner similar to that in scCD3 (17). However, when both heterodimer structures are aligned according to the backbone atoms of five -strands (A, B, E, F, and G strands) of the CD3 domains, the CD3 and CD3 domains appear to have very different overall shapes and orientations (Fig. 2 A). The CD3 ectodomain is more upright, because the two -sheets are more parallel to each other than those in CD3 . This appearance is due to several factors. First, the F strand in CD3 is more parallel to the G strand than to the C strand (which contains a -bulge) within the CD3 domain. Second, there are more hydrogen bonds formed between the two G strands at the CD3 interface than those in murine CD3 . Third, the BC loop is very short (see above) and cuts across the two -sheets, preventing the FG loop from bending to the ABED face as in CD3 and CD3 . Finally, additional hydrogen bonds, involving Pro-45 and Arg-46 residues just before the F strand, with Tyr-64 in the G strand and Thr-25 in the CD loop, respectively, also help to straighten the GFC -sheet (Fig. 6). Fig. 2 A shows that CD3 is closer to the pseudo 2-fold axis of the CD3 heterodimer, whereas the GFCC face of CD3 is rotated away from CD3 in CD3 . It appears that there is a more pronounced cleft between the two CD3 ectodomains in CD3 than in CD3 , which is possibly important for association with the TCR dimer. However, the core region of the sheep CD3 domain superimposes very well with mouse CD3 as shown in Fig. 2C. The average backbone rmsd when superimposing 21 residue pairs from the homologous regions of five -strands (A, B, E, G, and F strands) is only 1.18 Å between CD3 and mouse CD3 .

We designed N-terminal CD3 ectodomain fragments that were truncated at Val-79 of mouse CD3 and Met-66 of sheep CD3 sequences. These segments were covalently linked between the C terminus of CD3 and the N terminus of CD3 with a 33-aa peptide linker identical to that used in the scCD3 construct (30). The sheep CD3 chain was chosen instead of a murine orthologue to reduce surface-exposed hydrophobic residues and increase solubility. The residues at the dimer interface are highly conserved between murine and sheep of CD3 species, as discussed below (Figs. 1C and 5, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). 15N1H 2D NMR spectra indicated that only the purified chimera scCD3 (murine CD3 and sheep CD3 ) with the 33-aa peptide linker was structured and stable under physiological conditions (unpublished results), compared with the multiple murine scCD3 constructs tested. The NMR results suggest that the 33-aa linker is highly mobile and does not interact with the CD3 domains (possibly looping around the CD3 domain across the GFC face in a highly flexible manner).
Domain Characterization of CD3 . As shown in Fig. 1 A and B, both sheep CD3 and murine CD3 are Ig domains consisting of two -sheets each. The murine CD3 domains in the CD3 and CD3 solution structures are extremely similar (Fig. 2 A and B) (17), although the NMR structures were obtained at different and pH 7.4 for CD3 ). pH conditions (pH 4.5 for CD3 The average backbone root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between the two CD3 domains is 1.45 Å when superimposed for all but the six N-terminal residues, whereas the average backbone rmsd when superimposed for 31 residue pairs from six -strands (A, B, E, G, F, and C strands) is only 0.92 Å.

7, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The residue Leu-22 in the same -bulge is also tilted toward residue Met-48 on the F strand to allow more hydrophobic contacts. In addition, the region of the D strand and DE loop of CD3 , but not CD3 , is negatively charged (Fig. 8, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The DE loop of sheep CD3 is bent outward, so that the putative glycan anchored to residue Asn-33 is pointing up and away from another putative glycan anchored to residue Asn-16 in the beginning of the BC loop (Fig. 1B). This unusual orientation may be caused by an apparent hydrogen bond between the backbone atoms of a conserved Ser-18 residue in the BC loop and the Asn-33 residue in the DE loop (Fig. 7). Perhaps this is a substitution for the canonical hydrogen bond formed between the side-chain NH group of the tryptophan residue missing from the CD3 C strand and the backbone carbonyl of a residue in the C E loop, serving to strengthen the stability of the Ig domain. Mouse and human CD3 both have an additional glycosylation site at the beginning of the FG loop so that the top of each CD3 ectodomain would be covered heavily with two to three complex-sugar systems. Discussion In the present study, we have structurally characterized a CD3 heterodimer by NMR spectroscopy. The CD3 domains in both CD3 and CD3 structures are nearly identical (Fig. 2 A and B), consistent with the conservation of residues in CD3 and CD3 that interact with CD3 . Not surprisingly, mAbs with specificity for CD3 in mouse or human (i.e., hamster antimouse CD3 145-2C11, rat anti-mouse CD3 17A2, or mouse anti-human CD3 OKT3) immunoprecipitate both CD3 and CD3 heterodimers from T cells (6, 18). The overall average backbone rmsd of scCD3 is 0.62 Å (Table 1), compared with 0.95 Å for murine scCD3 (17). The high-quality NMR data of scCD3 herein offer excellent characterization of all of the loop regions except for one segment of the FG loop in CD3 . The murine and sheep CD3 sequences are highly homologous (amino acid identity of 47%), especially in the G strand at the CD3 dimer interface. However, there is virtually no consensus sequence in the segment between the C and E strands of CD3 from different species, and a highly conserved buried tryptophan residue in the respective C strands is missing in sheep, mouse, and rat. The conformation of this region, with the translocated D strand in particular, may be determined by three highly conserved features, namely an N(S T)S glycosylation site in the short BC loop, a GT tight turn in the CD loop, and an additional NKT glycosylation site conserved among sheep, mouse, and rat near the N terminus of the E strand. The upright orientation of CD3 and the unique conformations of the BC and DE loops are likely to guide the attached glycans away from the membrane (Fig. 1B), which, we reason, is structurally important for the association between CD3 and TCR dimers. Our first attempt to investigate possible interactions between the CD3 ectodomain fragment and TCR molecule, using 15N-labeled scCD3 titrated with unlabeled deglycosylated N15 TCR dimer (truncated at the interchain disulfide bond-forming cysteine residues near the C termini) failed to show any detectable binding (see supporting information). In search of a putative contact face between the CD3 and TCR -chains, we examined conserved residues in CD3 from different species. The conserved residues in CD3 are concentrated at the bottom half of the domain, in the hydrophobic core of the protein, or in the unique small BC loop (Figs. 1C and 5). Additional homologous residues are found at the dimer interface and the B and C strands. Most of these residues appear to be important for the structural integrity of the CD3 domain or the CD3 dimeric interface. Most significant conserved regions unique to CD3 (not found in CD3 and CD3 ) include the AB loop with an ED(K R) pattern, and the N-terminal half of the
Sun et al.

The Interface of the CD3 Heterodimer. The dimer interface of scCD3 (Fig. 3) is very similar to that of CD3 (17). The total buried area is 1,546 Å2, larger than the 1,306 Å2 of the murine CD3 interface, as determined for representative NMR structures by using NACCESS software (http: wolf.bms.umist.ac.uk naccess). This increase is mostly the result of additional contacts near the top of the G strands (Phe-58 , Thr-59 , and Asn-70 ) between the two CD3 domains, consistent with the more upright CD3 structure. The residues in CD3 that contribute 10 Å2 each to the buried surface area at the dimer interface include Ser-57 , Phe-58 , Thr-59 , Leu-60 , Gln-61 , Tyr-63 , Tyr-64 , Arg-65 , and Met66 from the G strand, Val-4 and Glu-6 from the A strand, Met-48 from the F strand, and Arg-41 from the EF loop. All of these residues (except for Arg-41 , Ser-57 , and Phe-58 ) are highly conserved or homologous between sheep and murine CD3 (Fig. 1C), justifying our approach of creating a chimeric mouse sheep CD3 heterodimer for solution structural studies under physiological conditions. The residues in murine CD3 and sheep CD3 domains that are important for dimer association (mostly from the G strands) are shown in Fig. 3 as stick models on the background of the molecular surface of their binding partners. The key residues from CD3 (shown in cyan) are three tyrosine residues, Tyr-59 , Tyr-72 , and Tyr-74 , that protrude into cavities on the CD3 surface. The hydrophobic residues on the opposite side of the G strand plus residues from the A strand in CD3 form the base of cavities to accommodate residues at the interface of CD3 . In addition, Tyr-64 and Lys-76 form an aromatic ring­aliphatic chain hydrophobic contact, whereas Gln-61 and Tyr-8 (data not shown) form a side chain-to-backbone hydrogen bond. Comparison of Regions Between C and E Strands of CD3 and CD3 .

The C strand in CD3 is shifted unexpectedly by two residues with respect to the amino acid sequence-based alignment with CD3 (17) (Fig. 1C), causing the BC loop, which contains only four residues, to form a tight turn that cuts across the -sheets (Fig. 1 A and B). A highly conserved tryptophan residue in the central position of the C strand of CD3 and CD3 is missing from the sheep and mouse CD3 sequence and is replaced by a hydrophobic isoleucine residue (or valine in mouse CD3 ) just before the C strand in sheep CD3 . A -bulge near the end of the C-strand in CD3 disrupts hydrogen bonds necessary for C strand formation (Fig. 1B), causes the side chain of residue Leu-21 to tilt toward the center of the CD loop region, and stabilizes it by interacting with Leu-36 from the E strand (Fig.

EF loop with a K(R G)(I V)(L) pattern near the bottom of the CD3 domain (Figs. 1C and 5). We hypothesize that the appearance of these conserved regions may participate in an interaction with the highly conserved membrane-proximal TCR -chain-connecting peptide ( -CP), the peptide linking the C terminus of the TCR constant domain with the N terminus of the TM helix. In this regard, removal of the FETDxNLN sequence within -CP blocks positive selection in the thymus, similar to the consequence of CD3 gene deletion (26, 36). Our preliminary NMR binding experiments failed to confirm such an interaction using a synthetic -CP (see Supporting Text, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). However, this result is inconclusive because the synthetic -CP may lack structure in the absence of a membrane context or other essential TCR components. , CD3 , and CD3 hetHaving structures of TCR erodimers permits us to construct a plausible model for the topology of assembled subunit ectodomains of the TCR (Fig. 4 A and B). Given that CD3 has an ectosegment only 9-aa long, its extracellular segment is omitted from the figure, as are the connecting peptides of TCR - and -chains and the RxCxxCxE stalk regions proximal to the TM segments of CD3 , CD3 , and CD3 . However, this rendering incorporates the consequences of several known TCR characteristics: TM charge pairs involving TCR subunit chain associations, CD3 ­CD3 ­TCR ­CD3 ­ CD3 as one cluster and CD3 ­CD3 ­TCR as a second cluster

(37, 38), extracellular domain associations involving other in vitro chain-association data (7, 39), TCR crosslinking results (6, 40), and proximity of one CD3 subunit to the TCR C FG loop by quantitative T cell surface immunofluorescent Ab binding analysis (9). In addition, structural insights from crystallographic data on the glycosylated N15 TCR in complex with the H57 Fab fragment and the likely position of glycans in both CD3 and CD3 uncovered herein are considered. Specifically, CD3 is presumed to be near the pocket formed between the TCR C CD and EF loops and the C FG loop (9, 41). Residues in the TCR C AB loop, which shows significant conformational change for an LC13 TCR upon pMHC binding (42), were used as target sites for CD3 docking in the initial search for possible docking models. CD3 is docked on the opposite site of the TCR domain where there is less glycan to interfere with the more heavily glycosylated CD3 subunit (Fig. 4B), consistent with known TCR and CD3 TM associations. Immediately evident is the central position of the TCR heterodimer with a vertical dimension of 80 Å projecting from the cell membrane, flanked on either side by the shorter (40 Å) CD3 heterodimers, CD3 on the ``left'' TCR side and CD3 on the ``right'' TCR side. Note that the widths of the CD3 and CD3 components, 50 Å and 55 Å, respectively, are comparable with that of the TCR heterodimer (58 Å) and together (excluding glycans) span 160 Å. These flanking CD3 components will likely impede lateral movement of the TCR heterodimer upon pMHC binding. As previously noted for CD3 (17), the intradomain disulfide bridge between cysteine residues on the B and F strands at the center of each CD3 domain reinforces the domain structure. Further rigidity for potential signal transduction comes from the paired G -strands in each CD3 heterodimer, coupled with the conserved RxCxxCxE cysteine-coordinated stalks. The length of the CD3 subunit stalks is typical for TM proteins (5­10 aa) observed, for example, for CD2, CD4 and CD58. On the other hand, the connecting peptides found in TCR (25­26 residues) and TCR (19 residues) are long. The latter are probably mandated by a requirement for a linker segment of sufficient length to span the 50 Å from the end of the interchain disulfide of the TCR constant domain to the associated CD3 and CD3 TM segments that are juxtaposed for charge pairing (i.e., the TCR lysine and aspartate residues of CD3 and CD3 TM, respectively). Similar considerations must be applied to the TCR -connecting peptide, including charge pairing of the TM TCR lysine with an aspartic and a glutamic acid residue of CD3 and CD3 TM, respectively. Note that the TCR TM also includes an arginine residue that is thought to form a charged pair with an aspartate residue in each of the CD3 TM segments (37). Given crystallographic details on TCR, CD4, and CD8 interactions with pMHC I and pMHC II ligands (43), it is clear that the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors are located at left in Fig. 4 A and B, adjacent to CD3 when binding to the same pMHC ligand as the TCR. Not surprisingly, CD3 couples the TCR with lipid raft-associated CD8 required for effective activation and positive selection of CD8 T cells (44). Although the relatively flexible CD8 stalk region poses no steric constraints for concurrent TCR ligation, CD4 is a rigid concatamer with four Ig domains comprising its extracellular segment (45, 46). Nevertheless, structural analysis (43) shows that the membraneproximal ends of CD4 and TCR are 100 Å apart, providing ample space for the CD3 heterodimer to occupy a position between the two T cell surface molecules. The multiple N-linked glycan adducts are prominent components of the TCR complex (Fig. 4 A and B). In addition to guiding pMHC ligands to the TCR recognition surface, these glycans may play a regulatory role by contributing to a galectin­glycoprotein lattice (47). In this regard, a deficiency in the 1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5) enzyme crucial in the N-glycosylation pathway lowers the T cell activation threshold by enhancing TCR

clustering. The more heavily glycosylated CD3 subunit may influence TCR subunit assembly through steric constraints. However, the distinct conformation of C relative to C and or differences in their respective connecting peptides are likely responsible for exclusion of CD3 from association with TCR heterodimers (36, 48). The distribution of glycans in the model shown in Fig. 4A is also consistent with the lack of mAbs raised against the native CD3 and CD3 subunits. We hypothesize that, based on the structures of CD3 and CD3 , highly selective TCR signaling may require dynamic interaction rather than static on-and-off switching, such that the interfaces between the extracellular domains of the TCR heterodimer and CD3 dimers may be quite small. With this current model, no detailed information on the interfaces is warranted, being one of a range of acceptable structures. None-chains being theless, we envisage the ectodomains of TCR supported by the CD3 heterodimers, whereas components of the TCR dimer, such as the C FG loop (41) and the -CP (36, 49), may serve as levers to control vertical movements of CD3 subunits for signal transduction through the critical TM segments. Given the apparently weak ectodomain association beheterodimers (this paper and ref. 41 and tween CD3 and TCR references therein), it is possible that this assembly undergoes dynamic quaternary change upon TCR ligation, thereby affecting cytoplasmic CD3 signaling regions.

According to the model in Fig. 4C, there are two separate clusters of TM segments: the five helices of the CD3 ­CD3 ­TCR ­ CD3 ­CD3 component lie closer to the TCR subunit, and the three helices of the CD3 --CD3 ­TCR component lie closer to the TCR subunit (37). The cluster shown at left in Fig. 4C has eight cytoplasmic ITAMs, one in CD3 , one in CD3 , and three in each CD3 , whereas the cluster shown at right in Fig. 4C has two ITAMs, one in CD3 and one in CD3 . Given that the copy number of ITAMs augments TCR signaling strength (50), it is easy to imagine how signaling will be dramatically attenuated when this cluster is perturbed by CD3 deletion or -CP mutation. Because positive selection involves the weakest of self­pMHC­ligand interactions, amplification of signal through multiple ITAMs in both clusters is critical for TCR-mediated signaling (51). Pre-TCR signaling must largely rely on the right cluster (Fig 4C) because pT , the -chain surrogate, lacks a V domain for signaling (27). As additional details begin to emerge about these ectodomains and membrane-proximal and TM segments, the structural basis of TCR signaling through its amazing set of components will become clear.
