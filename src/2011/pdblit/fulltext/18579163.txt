Abstract A novel member of the vasopressin/oxytocin superfamily, octopressin (OP), has been isolated from Octopus vulgaris. Since another peptide of this superfamily, cephalotocin (CT), was isolated from the same species [Neurosci. Lett. 134 (1992) 191], Octopus has two members of the superfamily as in vertebrates, an observation made for the first time in invertebrates. Octopressin caused contractions of the Octopus peripheral tissues such as oviduct, aorta, rectum, etc. Cephalotocin had no effects on tested tissues. The octopressin and cephalotocin precursors were composed of a signal peptide, a nonapeptide, and a neurophysin domain--the typical structural organizations of the superfamily precursors. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/Southern blot analysis revealed that octopressin mRNA was expressed in the supraesophageal and subesophageal brains, and the buccal and gastric ganglia. Cephalotocin mRNA was expressed mostly in the subesophageal brain. In situ hybridization in the brain showed that octopressin mRNA was localized in many lobes. Expression of cephalotocin mRNA was almost limited in the ventral median vasomotor lobe. Some of the neurons in this lobe are the source of the neurosecretory system of the vena cava, where cephalotocin was originally isolated. These results suggest that octopressin may be a multifunctional neuropeptide contributing to reproduction, cardiac circulation, and feeding. Cephalotocin may play important roles in metabolism, homeostasis, etc., as a neurohormone. D 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) are structurally and functionally related neurohypophysial peptide hormones. The main endocrine functions of VP are an antidiuretic activity and a hypertensive effect in mammals. Oxytocin causes contractions of uterus and milk ejection. Over the past decade, particularly the central actions of VP and OT have been intensively studied, revealing that VP and OT contribute the central behavioral effects such as social, sexual, maternal, and feeding behaviors; memory; learning; etc. [2,3]. The members of the VP/OT superfamily are widely distributed throughout the animal kingdom: vertebrates, arthropods [4], annelids [5,6], and mollusks [1,7 ­ 10]. All vertebrate species except for cyclostomes [11,12] contain at least one VP and one OT family member. In contrast, the co-

occurrence of VP- and OT-like peptides in a single species of invertebrate has never been demonstrated. Lys-conopressin is the only member present in a pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis [13], and it has OT-like reproductive functions as well as VP-like metabolic functions [14,15]. Moreover, the functional studies have been focused on the classical and peripheral actions. Octopuses are one of the most intelligent invertebrates. They have highly developed sensory and motor systems and a large multilobed brain, which is capable of complex analysis and learning and control of behaviors. Multiple matrices in the memory system of octopus are somewhat like the mammalian hippocampus [16]. Cephalotocin (CT), a member of VP/OT superfamily, was isolated from nerve terminals of the neurosecretory system of the vena cava in Octopus vulgaris [1]. Although CT is likely to be a peptide hormone, neither the biological activities nor the precursor of CT has been elucidated. In this study, we isolated a novel peptide of the VP/OT superfamily, octopressin (OP), from Octopus. Biological activities of OP and CT on Octopus peripheral tissues were

compared. To determine the features of the precursors and to investigate the molecular evolution or divergence of the VP/ OT superfamily, we isolated and characterized the cDNAs of OP and CT precursors. Furthermore, the expressions of OP and CT mRNAs in the Octopus brain were observed. This is the first report showing the co-occurrence of the VP/ OT superfamily in a single invertebrate species.

following columns: (1) a cation exchange column (TSK gel SP-5PW, 7.5 Â 75 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan; 0 ­ 0.6 M NaCl/60 min linear gradient in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, flow rate of 1 ml/min); and (2) a reversed-phase column (Capcell pak C18, UG80, 4.6 Â 150 mm; Shiseido; 24­ 44% acetonitrile/40 min linear gradient in 0.1% TFA, flow rate of 1 ml/min). A symmetrical single peak was eluted from the column with 26.5% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. 2.3. Structure determination and synthesis The amino acid sequence was determined with an amino acid sequencer (PSQ-1 protein sequencer; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The molecular weight of the purified peptide was determined by nanoflow electrospray ionization timeof-flight mass spectrometry (nano-ESI-TOF-MS) (Q-TOF; Micromass UK, Wythenshawe, UK). The peptide was synthesized with a solid-phase peptide synthesizer using standard Fmock chemistry (Model 433A; Applied Biosystems Japan, Tokyo, Japan). 2.4. Bioassay Ten-millimeter-long specimens of the rectum, oviduct, spermatophoric gland, and efferent branchial vessel were excised from Octopus (n = 3 ­5), respectively. The changes in tension due to contraction were recorded using a force displacement transducer (Type 45169A; NEC-Sanei, Tokyo, Japan) and a strain amplifier (AS1202; NEC-Sanei). The anterior aorta was cut into a ring slice (1 mm long), which was inserted between two hooks in a chamber of UFER Micro-Easy Magnus (Iwashiya Kishimoto Medical Instruments, Kyoto, Japan). One hook was connected to a force displacement transducer, and the other to a tension manipulator. The sample application and the tension recording

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Animals Octopuses, O. vulgaris (approximately 1 kg wet weight), were purchased from a local fish shop and kept in aerated artificial seawater (ASW) at 18 jC. 2.2. Purification of the peptide The methods for dissection, extraction, and purification were the same as those previously described [17]. Briefly, 58-g wet weight of the Octopus rectums (50 animals) were boiled in distilled water for 10 min. The mixture was acidified by adding acetic acid to make up a 3% concentration, and homogenized. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a Sep-pak Vac C18 cartridge (10 g, 35 ml; Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted from the cartridge with 60% methanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The eluate was concentrated in vacuo and fractionated by a reversedphase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Capcell pak C18, UG80, 10 Â 250 mm; Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan; 0­ 60% acetonitrile/60 min linear gradient in 0.1% TFA, flow rate of 1.5 ml/min). An aliquot of each fraction was bioassayed in the isolated Octopus rectum. The fractions that caused contractions were further purified using the

were conducted in a manner similar to that described previously [18]. 2.5. Cloning of cDNAs encoding the precursor proteins of the peptides Nucleotides were ordered from Sawady Technology (Tokyo, Japan) and Kiko-Tech (Osaka, Japan). Degenerate primers were designed based on the amino acid residues of OP and CT (op-d-F1 and ct-d-F1: Cys1 ­Pro7 of OP and CT; op-d-F2 and ct-d-F2: Trp3 ­ Gly9 of OP and CT, respectively). Primers used are listed in Table 1. PCR was performed using Ex Taq polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) and the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems Japan). Total RNA was isolated from the Octopus brains with Sepasol-RNA I (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 Ag of the total RNA using the 5V /3VRACE kit (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan). The first amplification was performed using the PCR anchor primer and op-d-F1 for OP cDNA (or ct-d-F1 for CT cDNA) and PCR conditions: 94 jC for 5 min; 35 cycles (or 30 cycles) of 94 jC for 30 s, 50 jC (or 48 jC) for 30 s, 72 jC for 2 min; and 72 jC for 7 min. The second amplification was performed using the PCR anchor primer and op-d-F2 (or ct-dF2) and PCR conditions: 94 jC for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 jC for 30 s, 50 jC (or 45 jC) for 30 s, 72 jC for 2 min; and 72 jC for 7 min. Nucleotide sequences were determined with the ABI PRISM 310 (Applied Biosystems Japan). The 5V -ends of the cDNAs were determined as follows: firststrand cDNA from 2 Ag of total RNA using op/ct-R1 and the 5V /3VRACE kit (Roche Diagnostics), the first amplification (the oligo dT anchor primer and op/ct-R2), and the second amplification (the PCR anchor primer and op-R3 or ct-R3). Both amplifications were performed under the following conditions: 94 jC for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 jC for 30 s, 55 jC for 30 s, 72 jC for 2 min; and 72 jC for 7 min. Full-length cDNAs were obtained using two primer sets: full-op-FW1 and full-op/ct-RV1 (OP cDNA), full-ctFW1 and full-op/ct-RV1 (CT cDNA), and PCR conditions: 94 jC for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 jC for 30 s, 55 jC for 30 s, 72 jC for 1 min; and 72 jC for 7 min. Products of 900 or 800 bp were thus obtained and their nucleotide sequences were determined. 2.6. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)/Southern blot analysis One microgram of total RNAs extracted from various Octopus tissues was reverse-transcribed by Superscript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using oligo dT12 ­ 18 primer. PCR using full-op-FW1 and full-op/ct-RV1 (OP cDNA), and fullct-FW1 and full-op/ct-RV1 (CT cDNA) were performed under the conditions: 94 jC for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 jC for 30 s, 55 jC for 30 s, 72 jC for 1 min; and 72 jC for 7 min. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, and then transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen

Plus; NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled oligonucleotide probes (op-F1 for OP cDNA, ct-F1 for CT cDNA) were hybridized at 50 jC. The signals were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-DIG antibody and the chemiluminescence substrate, disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioethane-3,2V -chloro) ]-(5V tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate (CSPD), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Parallel experiments starting from the templates that were not reverse-transcribed were also performed to avoid the amplification from contaminating genomic DNA in the samples. Expression of Octopus actin [17] was also tested as an internal control. 2.7. In situ hybridization histochemistry DIG-labeled sense and antisense RNA probes were synthesized by PCR fragments of OP- and CT-specific

cDNAs with T7 RNA polymerase in a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). PCR was performed with four sets of forward and reverse primers: T7-full-op-FW1 and op-R3 (OP sense), full-op-FW1 and T7-op-R3 (OP antisense), T7-full-ct-FW1 and ct-R3 (CT sense), and full-ctFW1 and T7-ct-R3 (CT antisense). The whole brain of Octopus (n = 8) was fixed in a 10% formaldehyde solution (Nacalai Tesque) overnight at 4 jC, then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned to 7 Am. Prehybridization was conducted as previously described [18]. The sections were hybridized with respective probes (50 ­ 75 ng/section) overnight at 42 jC. The signals were detected from sections of 8/8 fixed brains with NBT/BCIP (nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro3-indolyl-phosphate; Roche Diagnostics). Control experiments were performed with the corresponding sense cRNA probes on adjacent sections.

OP evoked rhythmic contractions with increased tonus in the rectum (A), oviduct (B), and efferent branchial vessel (D); rhythmic contractions in the spermatophoric gland (C); and tonic contractions in the ring slice of the anterior aorta (E). CT had no effect on these tissues. The peptide was applied at the times indicated by the arrows.

sequence of the isolated peptide was shown to be X ­ Phe ­ Trp ­ Thr ­ Ser ­ X ­ Pro ­ Ile ­ Gly by a protein sequencer (X: an unidentified residue). No phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino acid was observed in the first cycle of Edman degradation, while two peaks appeared in the sixth cycle: the DTT adduct of PTH-dehydroalanine and an unidentified peak eluted just after PTH-Arg. Nokihara et al. [19] reported that the first half-cystine did not appear on the chromatogram, while the second halfcystine was detected as two specific peaks: the DTT adduct of PTH-dehydroalanine and PTH-Cys eluted just after PTH-Arg. Therefore, the unidentified residues at positions 1 and 6 were expected to be two Cys residues joined by a disulfide bond. The observed value, 505.70 [M + 2H]2 +, in the TOF-MS analysis was identical to the mass number (505.70 [M + 2H]2 +) calculated for the above sequence including two disulfide-bridged Cys residues at positions 1 and 6, and an amide at the Cterminus. A coinjected mixture of the purified and synthetic peptides was eluted as a single symmetrical peak both in a reversed-phase (Fig. 1E) and a cation exchange HPLC (Fig. 1F). Thus, the structure of the isolated peptide was confirmed to be: H-Cys ­ Phe ­ Trp ­ Thr ­ Ser­ Cys ­Pro ­Ile ­Gly ­ NH2 (Table 2), whose Cys residues made an intramolecular disulfide bridge. Since the structural features of the isolated peptide were similar to other known VP/OT superfamily members (Table 2), the peptide was thought to be a member of this superfamily.

The peptide showed contractile activity on the anterior aorta (see Section 3.2), so we named it octopressin. 3.2. Contractile activities on the smooth muscles of Octopus tissues The effects of OP and CT on contractions of the rectum, oviduct, spermatophoric gland, efferent branchial vessel, and anterior aorta were examined. OP (10À 6 ­ 10À 7 M) evoked rhythmic contractions with increased tonus in the rectum, oviduct, and efferent branchial vessel (Fig. 2A, B, and D), and caused rhythmic contractions in the spermatophoric gland (Fig. 2C) and tonic contractions in the ring slice of the anterior aorta (Fig. 2E). The effect on the anterior aorta was observed as low as 10À 9 M (data not shown). In contrast, CT (10À 5 M) had no effect on these tissues (Fig. 2A ­ E). To test whether CT increases or reduces the effect of OP on the aorta, CT (10À 5 M) was applied to the chamber 3 min before the application of OP (10À 7 M). The response was identical to that of OP alone (data not shown), indicating that CT showed neither an agonistic nor an antagonistic effect on the aorta. These results suggest that OP and CT have different functions on peripheral tissues.

3.3. Nucleotide sequences and precursor structures of OP and CT The full-length cDNAs encoding the OP and CT precursors and the deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 3. The OP precursor cDNA consists of 914 bp, excluding the poly(A) tail, and predicts a protein of 145 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 15,553. The CT precursor cDNA consists of 789 bp encoding 152 amino acids with a molecular mass of 16,446. Nucleotide sequence data were deposited to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession numbers AB056454 (OP) and AB056464 (CT). The N-terminal sequences of the OP precursor (Met1 ­ Gln45) and the CT precursor (Met1 ­Lys52) are different from each other. Both of the remaining parts (OP: Cys46 ­ Lys145; CT: Cys53 ­ Lys152) are identical except for two nucleotide bases (Fig. 3). These data show that OP and CT exist as independent precursors, which are very much alike. The predicted N-terminal sequences of the two precursors (OP: Met1 ­ Gly23; CT: Met1 ­ Gly28) contain hydrophobic amino acids, a feature characteristic of signal peptides. Each nonapeptide is connected to a neurophysin domain by the Gly ­ Lys ­ Arg sequence, a signal for

Identical amino acid residues in all precursors are highlighted in black. Highly conserved amino acid residues are highlighted in gray. The asterisks indicate the 14 conserved Cys residues.

domains conserved the positions and numbers of Cys residues (Fig. 4). Since the structural organizations of these precursors were typical of those other known VP/OT superfamilies, it was confirmed that OP and CT are members of this superfamily.

mRNA were high in the supraesophageal brain and the gastric ganglion, and low in the subesophageal brain and the inferior buccal ganglion. CT mRNA was detected mostly within the subesophageal brain, and at a low level in the

supraesophageal brain. There was no expression of CT mRNA in the tested ganglia. Parallel experiments starting from the templates that were not reverse-transcribed gave no PCR products (data not shown).

3.5. In situ hybridization histochemistry in the brain The octopus has the most advanced brain from among invertebrates and its gross anatomy and neuronal pathways have been thoroughly investigated [28]. Based on anatomical connections, coupled with the effects of localized electrical stimulation, a functional interpretation of the octopus brain was reported [28]. The physiological functions of a certain substance can be inferred by its localization in the brain. Sagittal section of the brain by Nissl staining was illustrated in Fig. 6A. In situ hybridization histochemistry using CT- and OP-specific cRNA antisense probes on adjacent sections was performed. The expression of CT mRNA was almost limited within the ventral median vasomotor lobe of the subesophageal brain (Fig. 6B1 ­ 2). In addition to the ventral median vasomotor lobe, OP mRNA was expressed in many lobes of the brain such as the superior buccal, anterior basal, median basal, dorsal basal, vertical, subvertical, posterior brachial, and palliovisceral lobes (Fig. 7A1 ­ 14). Control hybridizations with sense cRNA probes showed no signals (Figs. 6C1 ­ 2 and 7B1 ­ 14). The significant difference between the distributions of CT and OP mRNAs in the lobes suggested that CT and OP might have different physiological functions.

4. Discussion We have been screening biologically active peptides in the rectum of O. vulgaris. A novel peptide, which is clearly a member of the VP/OT superfamily, was isolated. The peptides of VP/OT superfamily have been classified into the VP and OT families based on the amino acid residue at position 8. In the VP family, this residue is a basic amino acid such as Arg and Lys, whereas it is a neutral amino acid in the OT family [29]. Since position 8 of the isolated peptide is Ile, it might be argued that this peptide belongs to the OT family. However, the isolated peptide remarkably contracted the Octopus anterior aorta. This property is similar to that of VP on smooth muscle cells in arteries. Therefore, we named it octopressin. In addition to the already isolated peptide, cephalotocin [1], Octopus has two members of the superfamily as in vertebrates, an observation made for the first time in invertebrates. There are some unique features in the amino acid sequences of OP and CT. Amino acid residues at positions 2 ­5 are completely different, but the Ile at position 8 is identical. Recent studies suggest that classification of the VP/OT superfamily based on the residue at position 8 does not make sense in invertebrates [14,27]. Our result supports the hypothesis that not the residue at position 8 but residues 2 ­5 are important for high-affinity binding to the receptor and biological efficacy at least in invertebrates [13,14,27]. To date, only two invertebrate receptors of the VP/OT superfamily (LSCPR1 and LSCPR2) have been characterized from a pond snail L. stagnalis [14,15]. These receptors

distribute in the different reproductive organs and their properties are different; however, there is only one ligand, Lys-conopressin, in the snail [14,15]. We speculate that at least two discriminative receptors that recognize residues 2­ 5 of OP and CT exist in the respective target tissues in Octopus, and they mediate the specific physiological processes. The structural organization of OP and CT precursors is identical to those of the VP/OT superfamily precursors. The complete conservation of the number and positions of Cys residues of Octopus neurophysins suggests that their tertiary structures are highly similar to those of known neurophysins. The specific disulfide bridges formed by Cys residues are crucial for establishing the conformation of bovine neurophysin I and neurophysin II and for binding VP and OT [30 ­ 32]. The amino acid residues Glu78 and Arg39 of the bovine neurophysins are essential for binding VP and OT [27,30]. These significant residues are also conserved in the OP neurophysins (Glu81 and Arg44) and CT neurophysins (Glu88 and Lys52), suggesting that each Octopus neurophysin can bind OP and CT, respectively. OP was isolated from the rectum and evoked its rhythmic contractions with increased tonus, but the mRNA was not expressed in the rectum. Groups of nerve cells occur at the nodes of the intestinal plexus, sometimes constituting definite small ganglia [33]; however, the result of RT-PCR/ Southern blot analysis revealed that nerve cells do not express OP mRNA. Moreover, no endocrine cells express OP mRNA even if such cells would occur at the Octopus rectum. In general, nerve cells and neuroendocrine cells are the source of peptides in mollusks. The octopus rectum is innervated from the palliovisceral lobe, centrally, and from the gastric ganglion, peripherally [34]. The OP mRNA was actually expressed in this lobe and ganglion. Therefore, it is considered that some of the neurons therein transport OP as a neuropeptide via their axons to the rectum. Octopuses have highly developed sensory and motor systems, and a large multilobed brain, which is capable of complex analysis, learning, and control of behaviors. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that OP mRNA is expressed in many lobes of the brain. Among them, the superior buccal lobe is a higher motor center for the control of feeding and drawing in food by the arms [35]. This lobe centrally controls the feeding behavior, the inferior buccal ganglion peripherally does, and the gastric ganglion operates digestion [33]. The expression of OP mRNA in these lobes and ganglia suggests that OP may play important roles in feeding behavior. Interestingly, it has become clear that OT acts as a ``satiety hormone'' in mammals. Peripheral and central administrations of OT reduce feeding [2]. More than a million of neuronal cells in the vertical, subvertical, superior and inferior frontal, and superior and posterior buccal lobes of the octopus brain make a series of matrices concerned with touch and visual learning [16,36]. These matrices are somewhat like the mammalian hippocampus [16]. OP expressed in these lobes may contribute to

some roles in the memory and learning system of Octopus. Other lobes in the supraesophageal brain are concerned with walking, swimming, changing of color, respiration, escape jetting, etc. [35,37]. It is not unlikely that OP expressed in these lobes may be one of the multifunctional neuropeptides contributing to some of these behaviors. A feature of CT is its specific expression of mRNA in the ventral median vasomotor lobe. Some of the neurons in this lobe send axons and form a voluminous neutrophil inside the vena cava in direct contact with the blood, making a neurosecretory system [38]. CT was originally isolated from the vena cava [1], suggesting that CT synthesized in the ventral median vasomotor lobe was secreted to the blood. Since CT has not shown any effects on peripheral smooth muscles, it may be concerned with functions such as metabolism, homeostasis, etc., as a neurosecretory hormone. A possible target tissue might be the kidney, where water and ionic balances might be controlled. VP controlled these balances via cAMP-mediated receptor as an antidiuretic hormone in mammals. Vasotocin serves this function in nonmammalian species in vertebrates. The increase of cAMP was assayed after incubation of the Octopus kidney with CT; however, a remarkable change of cAMP concentration was not observed (data not shown). We have already cloned an orphan receptor that specifically responds to CT from the Octopus brain. Further studies on this receptor will contribute to the elucidation of the physiological functions of CT. Since most vertebrate species possess a VP-like and an OT-like peptide, two evolutionary lineages have been proposed: a vasotocin ­VP line and an isotocin ­mesotocin ­ OT line [2,39]. Because the most primitive cyclostomes (hagfish and lampreys) only have vasotocin [11,12], the VP and OT genes may have arisen by duplication of a common ancestral gene after the radiation of cyclostomes, which occurred between 500 and 450 million years ago [40,41]. In invertebrates, peptides of VP/OT superfamily have been characterized, and the precursors of Lys-conopressin [26] and annetocin [27] are organized much like the VP/OT superfamily precursors. The typical architecture of the precursors must have already been present in the Archaemetazoa, a stem group from which both vertebrates and invertebrates diverged about 600 million years ago [42]. To date, the co-occurrence of VP/OT superfamily members has never been demonstrated in invertebrates. Lys-conopressin is the only member of this superfamily in Lymnaea [13], and it has OT-like reproductive functions as well as VP-like metabolic functions; Lys-conopressin induces contractions of the vas deferens, thus stimulating the ejaculation of semen during copulation. In addition, it induces a depolarizing response in neuroendocrine cells that control carbohydrate metabolism [14,15]. In this study, the co-occurrence of two peptides of VP/OT superfamily is demonstrated in Octopus. It may be assumed that Octopus secured two peptides in the molluscan evolutionary process as vertebrates had two lineages of VP/OT superfamily. Further

studies on the receptors of OP and CT, and recognition of their physiological functions will elucidate the evolution of VP/OT superfamily and peptide ­receptor interactions. The VP/OT superfamily is involved not only in endocrine hormones but also in brain functions such as social, sexual, maternal, and feeding behaviors; memory; learning; etc. However, the studies of central actions are limited to higher mammals as yet. Our findings in this report may be a first step to elucidate the central behavioral effects of VP/OT superfamily in nonmammalians. There are some dramatic differences between the brains of vertebrates and cephalopods (octopuses and squids) [43]. The vertebrate central nervous system comprises one main nerve cord that has swollen at one end to create a brain. Most mollusks, on the other hand, have dual nerve cords running along the body axis; these are five or six pairs of ganglia. In the cephalopods alone among the mollusks, convergent evolution has also constructed a brain. It is anticipated that a comparative study of the brain systems of both octopuses and mammals will highlight the fundamental principles that are important in brain functions.
