The twin-arginine transport (Tat) system is dedicated to the translocation of folded proteins across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Proteins are targeted to the Tat system by signal peptides containing a twin-arginine motif. In Escherichia coli, many Tat substrates bind redox-active cofactors in the cytoplasm before transport. Coordination of cofactor insertion with protein export involves a ``Tat proofreading'' process in which chaperones bind twin-arginine signal peptides, thus preventing premature export. The initial Tat signal-binding proteins described belonged to the TorD family, which are required for assembly of N- and S-oxide reductases. Here, we report that E. coli NapD is a Tat signal peptide-binding chaperone involved in biosynthesis of the Tatdependent nitrate reductase NapA. NapD binds tightly and specifically to the NapA twin-arginine signal peptide and suppresses signal peptide translocation activity such that transport via the Tat pathway is retarded. High-resolution, heteronuclear, multidimensional NMR spectroscopy reveals the 3D solution structure of NapD. The chaperone adopts a ferredoxin-type fold, which is completely distinct from the TorD family. Thus, NapD represents a new family of twin-arginine signal-peptide-binding proteins.

he Tat (twin-arginine translocation) system is a proteintargeting pathway found in the cytoplasmic membranes of many prokaryotes (1). Tat-targeted proteins are synthesized as precursors with N-terminal signal peptides that contain distinctive SRRxFLK ``twin-arginine'' amino acid motifs (2). Twinarginine signal peptides have a common tripartite structure that includes a polar N-terminal (n) region, a moderately hydrophobic (h) region of 12­20 aa, and a C-terminal (c) region that often contains basic residues (2, 3). The consensus motif is always located at the junction between the n and h regions (2). Precursors bearing Tat signal peptides are transported by a membrane embedded export apparatus comprising a signal peptide recognition complex (4) and a protein-conducting channel (5). The physiological role of the Tat system is to transport fully folded proteins (1, 6, 7), and pathogenic bacteria deficient in Tat transport demonstrate reduced virulence, which has led to consideration of this system as a target for novel antiinfectives (8). The model eubacterium Escherichia coli produces 27 Tattargeted proteins (9). The majority of these are multisubunit, cofactor-containing respiratory enzymes that must bind their redox cofactors, fold, and often associate with signal-less partner subunits before membrane transport can proceed (10, 11). Coordination of these different processes has been the focus of recent research. For instance, the E. coli trimethylamine N-oxide reductase TorA is subject to a chaperone-mediated quality control process known as ``Tat proofreading,'' which prevents premature targeting of TorA until all biosynthetic processes are complete (11). The TorD chaperone recognizes the TorA signal peptide and binds directly to it, thus shielding it from the Tat

transporter (11, 12). E. coli TorD is a member of a family of peptide-binding proteins that share a common fold comprised almost entirely of -helices and completely devoid of -strand (13, 14). The E. coli napFDAGHBC operon encodes a periplasmic dissimilatory nitrate reductase [supporting information (SI) Fig. 4] (15). Periplasmic nitrate reductases are found in a broad spectrum of proteobacteria, including pathogens, and play a central role in the global nitrogen cycle (16, 17). The napA gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the nitrate reductase, a periplasmic protein that binds a [4Fe­4S] cluster and bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide as redox cofactors (18) and is targeted by a Tat signal peptide (Fig. 1B; ref. 19). The other proteins encoded by the nap operon have roles either in electron transfer to NapA (20) or in the biosynthesis of NapA (21, 22). NapD has been shown to be essential for NapA-dependent periplasmic nitrate reductase activity in E. coli (23). The similar cofactor requirements of NapA and TorA (24) suggest that NapA should also be subject to Tat proofreading during assembly. However, detailed sequence analysis suggests NapA and TorA followed different evolutionary lines (25, 26), consistent with this torD genes never colocalize with nap operons, suggesting that the respective biosynthetic mechanisms are also distinct. In this work, E. coli NapD was structurally and functionally defined as the paradigm representative of a second family of twin-arginine signal-peptide-binding proteins. The solution structure of NapD showed a - - - - - ``ferredoxin-type'' fold. Genetic and biophysical techniques demonstrate that NapD binds directly and specifically to the NapA twin-arginine signal peptide. NMR was used to probe the peptide-binding site on

(A) E. coli K-12 strains RJ611-HN (MC4100 parent strain, nap ), RJ611-HND (as RJ611-HN, napD), and FTD140 (as MC4100, napA::AprR) were cultured anaerobically in LB medium supplemented with 0.5% (vol/vol) glycerol and 0.4% (wt/vol) fumarate. Whole cells were harvested, washed, and either taken up directly in disaggregating buffer ( napD and napA lanes) or fractionated into periplasmic (P), total membranes (M), and cytoplasmic (C) proteins before being subjected to SDS/PAGE, blotted, and challenged with an anti-NapD serum (Upper) or an anti-NapA serum (Lower).

(D) ITC experiments performed by using identical concentrations of NapDhis and MalE::NapAhis but utilizing a range of buffers with differing specific heats of ionization. The experimentally observed enthalpy change ( Hobs) for each experiment was plotted against the ionization (deprotonation) enthalpy of the buffer used ( Hionization): sodium phosphate, 1.22 kcal/mol; Pipes, 2.74 kcal/mol; Mops, 4.90 kcal/mol; Aces, 7.51 kcal/mol; and Tris HCl, 11.49 kcal/mol.

coli napD gene was predicted to encode a protein of 87 aa (9,462 Da). Western blot analysis demonstrated NapD was a watersoluble cytoplasmic protein (Fig. 1 A) and thus located on the opposite side of the membrane from the mature NapA protein (Fig. 1 A). In the absence of the napD gene, E. coli lacks all periplasmic nitrate reductase activity (23). Western blot analysis demonstrated the NapA polypeptide was completely destabilized and degraded in a napD background (Fig. 1 A). Taken together, these data point to a role for NapD in the biosynthesis of NapA. The ability of NapD to recognize the NapA Tat signal peptide was tested by using a bacterial two-hybrid system based on reconstitution of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase in an E. coli cya mutant (27). NapD was fused to the C terminus of the T25 fragment, and the NapA signal was fused to the N terminus of the T18 fragment of B. pertussis adenylate cyclase. In this system, the efficacy of protein­protein interactions was reflected by -galactosidase activity in a reporter strain. Coproduction of the fusion proteins induced high -galactosidase activity (6,220 474 Miller units), indicating that NapD recognized the NapA signal peptide in vivo. The ability of NapD to bind directly to the NapA signal peptide in vitro was tested by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The NapA twin-arginine signal peptide contained a long stretch of consecutive alanine and valine side-chains (Fig. 1B), which precluded efficient in vitro synthesis. Instead, the peptide was synthesized in vivo as a C-terminal fusion to maltose-binding protein MalE and purified via a C-terminal His tag, thus ensuring only full-length chimera was included in ITC experiments. Titration of MalE::NapAhis with purified NapDhis generated negative enthalpy values and a sigmoidal binding curve that reached saturation (Fig. 1C). Analysis of the binding isotherm gave a best fit to a noncooperative model with a binding stoichiometry of 0.59 and an apparent Kd of 7 nM (Fig. 1C). Control titrations failed to detect any interactions between NapDhis and MalEhis lacking the signal peptide (SI Fig. 5A). The specific, tight binding of the NapA signal peptide by NapD was corroborated by size exclusion chromatography (SI Fig. 5C). The MalE::NapAhis chimera was premixed with NapDhis and loaded onto a molecular exclusion column. The MalE::NapAhis::NapDhis complex elutes as a higher-molecularmass species than either MalE::NapAhis or NapDhis alone (SI Fig. 5C). No binding of NapDhis to MalE::TorAhis was observed by this technique (SI Fig. 5C), confirming the specific nature of the NapD::NapA interaction. In ITC, the experimentally observed enthalpy change ( Hobs) upon peptide binding by NapD is the sum of the true enthalpy change upon binding ( Hbinding) plus the enthalpy change contributed by the number of protonation/deprotonation events occurring in the buffering system ( Hionization). To determine the true binding enthalpy of the protein­peptide interaction, identical ITC experiments in a range of buffers were carried out (Fig. 1D). The gradient of the line-of-best-fit indicated that a net release of one proton (nH 0.88) from the protein­peptide complex occurred during the binding event (Fig. 1D). As a result, the true enthalpy change ( Hbinding) of the NapDhis:: MalE::NapAhis interaction could be determined by linear regression (Fig. 1D) and was 4.92 kcal/mol (1 kcal 4.18 kJ). The true entropy change for the interaction (T Sbinding) could then be calculated as 6.28 kcal/mol. Thus, the binding thermodynamics point to a mechanism driven almost equally through favorable enthalpy and entropy changes (28).

The Solution Structure of NapD. The solution structure of recombinant NapDhis (95 residues; 10,528 Da) was determined by using high-resolution, heteronuclear, multidimensional NMR spectroscopy on the basis of 1,340 distance and 119 dihedral restraints (Table 1). No resonance assignments were obtained for residues 1, 2, 79, 80, and the C-terminal His tag residues 89­95 because of chemical exchange and flexibility of the N- and C-terminal parts of the NapD structure. The 20 conformers with the lowest energy values were chosen to represent the most probable structures from 100 randomized starting models and represented a well defined ensemble with good structural characteristics (Table 1). Residue-specific validation (29) revealed a well defined core and no regions in the protein with consistent successive low validation scores (Fig. 2C). NapD was found to have a cylindrical shape of approximate dimensions of 40 Å by 24 Å by 22 Å, and a 15N relaxation study clearly demonstrated NapD was a monomer in solution (SI Fig. 6). The polypeptide adopted a mixed / fold with four -strands and two -helices in a ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ferredoxin-like fold (Fig. 2 A). The -strands assembled together to generate a single antiparallel -sheet that formed one complete face of the protein, whereas the -helices formed the opposite face of the molecule. The final -strand in the NapD fold (residues 69­75) was followed by a flexible, unstructured, carboxyl-terminal tail. To determine the region(s) of the NapD protein responsible for recognition and binding of the NapA signal peptide, unlabeled MalE::NapAhis was titrated into a solution of 15N-labeled NapDhis. The peptide­protein interaction was monitored through perturbation of the cross-peaks in the [1H-15N]­ heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum (SI Fig. 7). Upon addition of ligand, a general broadening and only minor shifts of the resonances were observed (SI Fig. 7), consistent with the formation of a higher-molecular-weight species. This allowed the direct transfer of the unbound NapD resonance assignments to the complex. Some peaks, however, were more readily affected at substoichiometric NapA-to-NapD ratios (SI Fig. 7). The T86 HSQC cross-peak was least affected by the titration and was taken as the reference for comparing the cross-peak volumes between the bound and unbound states. By setting the bound to unbound ratio of T86 intensity to 1.0, the relative decreases in intensities of the other cross-peaks could be determined. The Y76 NH cross-peak was the most rapidly and severely affected upon peptide binding, followed by S9, L10, V11, A35, S37, L74, and V75. These residues all localize to the -sheet region and S9, V11, L74, and Y76 together form a

distinct patch on the -sheet face of NapD (Fig. 2B). The residues that were least affected upon peptide binding were, in general, localized within the -helical and turn regions (residues 53­69 and 17­31) on the opposite side of the molecule, or within the flexible C terminus, consistent with the peptide-binding site being located within the -sheet. NapD residues Y76 and S9, together with the conserved side chains E33, Q43, E49, and H77, were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis (SI Fig. 8). Separate substitutions of each of these NapD residues with Ala did not significantly impair either in vitro signal peptide-binding activity or NapD-dependent nitrate reductase biosynthesis in vivo (SI Fig. 8).
NapD Has Antitransport Activity. An in vivo assay was developed to

assess the effect of NapD on the Tat transport activity of the NapA signal peptide. The chloraphenicol acetyl transferase (Cat) protein is exported exclusively by the Tat pathway when fused to a twin-arginine signal peptide (30). A genetic fusion of the NapA signal peptide to Cat ( NapA::Cat) resulted in a host strain sensitive to high chloramphenicol concentrations (Fig. 3A) because the reporter protein was targeted to the periplasm (Fig. 3C). However, coexpression of the napD gene with the napA::cat chimera prevented both signal peptide processing and transport of the reporter protein to the periplasm (Fig. 3C) and thus conferred chloramphenicol resistance to the host strain (Fig. 3B). This effect was entirely specific to NapD because coexpression of torD in this assay did not result in increased chloramphenicol resistance (SI Fig. 9). Furthermore, the level of chloramphenicol resistance induced by excess NapD in this assay was comparable to that caused by complete inactivation of the Tat translocase itself (SI Fig. 9). Thus, it must be concluded that NapD binding to the NapA signal peptide completely blocks transport of NapA::Cat on the Tat pathway. This assay suggests NapD has a strong ``antitransport'' activity such that tight

binding to the NapA signal peptide can, in some circumstances, out compete its interaction with the Tat translocase itself. Discussion NapA is a member of the DMSO reductase family of molybdenum-containing enzymes (24), which can be further sorted into three evolutionarily distinct groups (25, 26): types I, II, and III. NapA is a type I enzyme and the well studied Tat substrate TorA belongs to the type III group. The napD gene is the most common nonstructural gene found in prokaryotic nap clusters and is never found colocalized with genes encoding other molybdoenzymes. Indeed, sequence analysis suggests the major differences between the NapA nitrate reductases and the nonexported type I nitrate reductases (NarB-like) are the presence of a Tat signal on NapA and the requirement for a NapD accessory protein in NapA biosynthesis (16). Here, we demonstrate that the genetic link between napD and a structural gene encoding a Tat-dependent nitrate reductase reflects a functional relationship. Tat transport activity of the NapA signal peptide can be repressed upon binding by NapD; however, this antitransport effect shows the interaction is difficult to reverse in nonnative systems. This is not an issue for the native NapA­ NapD system in which NapA is clearly efficiently assembled and exported. It is possible that signal-bound NapD can ``sense'' the
15644 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0703967104

folded state of the native NapA protein, which in turn triggers NapD release but not the folded state of the Cat reporter protein. A possible mechanism is not immediately obvious; however, this would require only a transient and unstable ``interaction'' between mature NapA and NapD, and, consistent with this hypothesis, no interaction between NapD and the purified, fully mature and active NapA enzyme could be detected by ITC or analytical ultracentrifugation (T. A. Clarke and F.S., unpublished results). It is conceivable, however, that signalbound NapD could adopt a different conformation from free NapD that would allow it to ``talk'' to the NapA mature enzyme or to a second accessory protein, for example, NapF. The structure of NapD introduces a new family of twinarginine signal peptide-binding proteins ( SI Fig. 10). The ferredoxin-like fold is common and found in proteins with diverse biological functions (31). The data presented here point to the -sheet face of NapD as harboring a single-peptidebinding site. Interestingly, the -sheet face of ferredoxin-like proteins is so often involved in mediating interactions with other moieties that it has been described as a ``supersite'' for ligand binding (32). Some members of the ferredoxin-like family have been at least implicated in peptide binding and protein transport systems, for example, the EpsM protein of the bacterial type II secretion system (33), and others are chaperones involved in metalloprotein assembly processes, for example, CopZ (34), UreE (35), and HypF (36). The ferredoxin-like fold of NapD is completely different from the all-helical fold exhibited by members of the previously described TorD family of twin-arginine signal-peptide-binding proteins (SI Fig. 11). Thus, consistent with the different evolutionary paths taken by NapA and TorA (25, 26), the concomitant mechanisms of signal-peptide recognition during biosynthesis are also evolutionarily distinct. In addition, FdhE and HyaE have been suggested as possible signal-peptide-binding chaperones for the Tat-dependent formate dehydrogenases and hydrogenases, respectively (1). Although detailed biochemical analyses of FdhE and HyaE have not been reported, structural genomics consortia have recently solved the 3D structures of these proteins, and they too adopt independent folds (SI Fig. 11). Thus, despite the Tat signal peptides from each of these complex enzymes having a final common purpose in interacting with the Tat translocase, the structures of the signal peptides must also be precision-tuned to fit only one type of binding protein. A future challenge will be to understand the molecular basis of how this exquisite chaperone specificity is balanced with a common transport function and, in some cases, the additional involvement of housekeeping chaperones (37, 38). This work highlights the structural diversity of chaperonemediated quality control systems operating on the Tat pathway. The solution structure of NapD presented here will enable future studies of this mode of regulation of enzyme biosynthesis and the ability of NapD to completely suppress the transport activity of a signal peptide may have future medical or biotechnological applications.

NapD Production and Purification. The pQE­NapD plasmid en-

codes NapD with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Production of isotopically labeled and unlabeled NapDhis was by well established protocols described in detail in SI Methods.
NMR Spectroscopy and Resonance Assignment. NMR samples were suspended in 20 mM deuterated Tris, pH 7.4 (Cambridge Isotope Labs)/1 mM DTT/5% (vol/vol) 2H2O. Three samples containing 100% 15N-labeled, 10% 13C-labeled/100% 15Nlabeled, or 100% 13C/100% 15N-labeled NapDhis at 0.5 mM were used for resonance assignments and NOE data collection. SpecMaillard et al.

tra were acquired at 25°C on Unity Inova 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Assignments of backbone and side-chain NMR resonances were obtained from CBCA(CO)NNH, HBH A(CBCACO)NNH, HNCACB, HN(CA)HA, and H(C)CH­ and (H)CCH­total correlation spectroscopy experiments recorded at 600 MHz by using standard assignment protocols. The assignment of aromatic side chain resonances was performed on a 13CNOESY­HSQC spectrum optimized for the aromatic region by using aromatic side-chain-specific chemical shifts and expected intraresidual distances. Stereospecific assignments of the prochiral methyl groups of valines and leucines, except valines 7, 36, 69, 72, 75, were obtained by using a 10% 13C-labeled/100% 15N sample (39). NOE assignments were performed by using AtnosCandid (40, 41) for automated NOE assignment in combination with CYANA2.0 for intermediate structure calculations. The input for AtnosCandid consisted of three 3D NOESY spectra recorded at 800 MHz: an aliphatic 13C NOESY­HSQC [spectral tolerances: 13C, 0.4 ppm; 1H (acquisition), 0.035 ppm; 1H (NOE), 0.035 ppm], 15N-NOESY­HSQC [spectral tolerances: 15N, 0.4 ppm; 1H (acquisition), 0.035 ppm; 1H (NOE), 0.035 ppm], and an aromatic 13C-NOESY­HSQC [spectral tolerances: 13C, 0.5 ppm; 1H (acquisition), 0.035 ppm; 1H (NOE), 0.035 ppm]. Before the start of the iterative procedure, all chemical shifts were matched to the NOESY spectra. Dihedral angle restraints were derived from chemical shifts by using the program Talos (42). Talos predictions with 90% or more good hits were selected as good predictions and converted to dihedral angle restraints. The target angle for each selected constraint was set to the Talos average 2 SDs. In total, 59 and 60 dihedral angle restraints were included in the iterative procedure and final refinement of the structures.

AtnosCandid, X-PLOR­NIH, and PROFIT. None of the 20 final solvent-refined structures contained violations of dihedral angle restraints larger than 10° and distance restraints larger than 0.3 Å. Structure validation was performed by using WHAT IF (44) and PROCHECK NMR (45). Assignments were absent for residues 1, 2, 79, 80, and 89­95 because these regions are flexible and adopt random coil conformations. Of residues 3­78 (backbone rmsd, 1.25 Å), the core region containing the secondary structure elements (residues 6­75) is well defined (backbone rmsd, 0.63 Å) and deemed suitable for detailed structural analysis (Table 1).
ITC. The pQM plasmid encodes a MalE protein with a flexible

C-terminal extension punctuated by a hexahistidine tag, and, by using the unique in-frame XmaI and NcoI sites in this vector, fusions could be generated in which a peptide was located C terminal to MalE and between the factor Xa site and the hexahistidine tag. The use of the pQM-NapASP and pQMTorASP vectors to purify MalE fusions to the NapA signal peptide and TorA signal peptide, respectively, is described in SI Methods. ITC was performed at 28°C in a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Routinely, 500 l of 50 M NapD was loaded into the syringe, whereas the sample cell contained 1.4285 ml of 5 M MalE fusion protein. Titrations consisted of 35 8 l injections of NapDhis. Data analysis was performed with Origin software (MicroCal; OriginLab Corp., Northhampton, MA).
Tat Transport Assay. The cat gene from pACYC184 was amplified by PCR and cloned as a XbaI­HindIII fragment into pUNI­ PROM to give pUNI­REP. DNA encoding the E. coli NapA signal peptide was amplified and cloned as BamHI­XbaI fragment into pUNI­REP to give pUNI­NapA. The napD gene in pUNI­NapD was moved as a BamHI­XbaI fragment into pSU­ PROM (KanR) (11) to give pSU­NapD. The plasmid pSU­TorD has been described previously (11). Aerobic growth rates of strain MG1655 at 37°C harboring combinations of these plasmids were monitored in a Synergy 2 plate reader/incubator (BioTek, Winooski, VT). We thank K.

NOE-based distance restraints obtained in the sixth cycle of the iterative AtnosCandid procedure were used to calculate and refine a final set of structure models. To ultimately refine the structures in explicit solvent, the distance restraints were converted to X-PLOR format and all upper distance bounds were increased with 0.2 Å to compensate for possible calibration artifacts caused by overlapping atoms in the CYANA structures. Because the refinement procedure in explicit solvent itself imposes limits on the proximity of atoms, van der Waal interactions are properly treated, and, therefore, all lower bounds were set to 0 Å. From this adapted set of distance restraints and the Talos-derived dihedral angle restraints, 100 structures were calculated by using a standard simulated annealing protocol in X-PLOR­NIH with the OPLSX force field (43). Fifty-four structures with no dihedral angle violations larger than 10° and distance restraint violations larger than 0.5 Å were selected for a final refinement in explicit solvent, of which the 20 lowest energy structures were used for the final analysis. Structure calculation statistics were obtained by using
