The tetracycline analog 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido)-6-demethyl-6deoxy-tetracycline (9glyTc) belongs to a new group of tetracyclines called glycylcyclines. They are strong antibiotics showing reduced sensitivity against the major tetracycline resistance mechanisms. We have determined the crystal structure of 9glyTc in complex with Tet repressor class Ê D, TetR(D), at 2.4 A resolution. Sterical hindrance at the entrance of the tetracycline binding tunnel of TetR by the bulky and charged glycylamido substituent interferes with conformational changes required for the mechanism of induction, and leads to decreased induction ef®ciency as observed for point mutations of amino acid residues located in the neighbourhood to the glycylamido moiety of bound 9glyTc.

Tetracyclines (Tc) prevent bacterial growth after binding to the small ribosomal subunit by inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Their extensive use in clinical application and feed stock has resulted in widespread resistance, as has been the case with other antibiotics (Neu, 1992). The most frequently occurring Tc resistance determinant in Gram-negative bacteria encodes the membrane residing antiporter protein TetA, which catalyzes active Tc ef¯ux (Speer et al., 1992). Expression of TetA is under tight transcriptional control of the Tet repressor, TetR. The homodimeric TetR binds with two a-helix-turn-a-helix

motifs to the palindromic operator-DNA sequence in the control region of the resistance determinant, preventing expression of tetR and tetA (for a review, see Hillen & Berens, 1994). Expression of both genes is induced by Tc, which binds to TetR as a (Mg Tc)-complex leading to conformational changes followed by release of operator DNA as suggested by X-ray structure analyses (Hinrichs et al., 1994; Kisker et al., 1995; Orth et al., 1998). The continuous search for Tc analogues (Figure 1) active against resistant strains led to the discovery of the so-called glycylcyclines carrying a 9-glycylamido-substituent (Testa et al., 1993; Sum et al., 1994). A particularly active derivative is 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido)-6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline (9glyTc), which binds to TetR in vivo, thereby inducing the Tc-speci®c resistance mechanism, but is not recognized by the resistance protein TetA (Someya et al., 1995). Here, we describe the crystal structure analysis of TetR of class (D), TetR(D), in complex with 9glyTc and compare it with the known structures of complexes between TetR(D) and tetracycline analogues (Hinrichs et al., 1994; Kisker et al., 1995), and a Tc-free TetR(D) variant (Orth et al., 1998).

tem. These results establish that 9glyTc leads to a reduced but still signi®cant induction of TetR(D) in vivo. Overall structure Superposition of the structure of the TetR(D)/ (Mg 9glyTc)2 complex with the thus far determined 2TRT and 2TCT, showed r.m.s. deviations Ê for main-chain atoms of only 0.43 and 0.33 A, respectively, indicating that the overall structures of the polypeptide folding are identical at the level of accuracy. Each polypeptide chain (residues 2 to 208) of the biologically active TetR homodimer is folded into ten a-helices, denoted a1 to a10 and the symmetry related a1H to a10H , respectively (see Figure 2). The N-terminal DNA-binding domains are constituted by the three helix bundles (a1 to a3) containing an a-helix-turn-a-helix motif (a2, a3), which is connected to the core domain by a4. The globular core domain, a5 to a10 and a5H to a10H , harbours two symmetry related, tunnel-like (Mg Tc) binding pockets, which are completely buried in the core and de®ned by a-helices 4 to 8, 8H and 9H , and their symmetry related counterparts, respectively. The entrance of the tunnel for the inducer was identi®ed next to a9H , which closes the entrance after inducer binding like a sliding door. The mechanism of the Tc-induced conformational changes has been outlined (Orth et al., 1998). Rearrangement of the relative orientation of a4 to

Figure 1. Chemical structure and substitution pattern of tetracycline analogues. The skeleton of the Tc molecule is a four-ring carbocyclic structure (ring labels A to D), differing from each other only by substituent variation. The molecule is clearly separated into a hydrophobic (shaded) and a hydrophilic region. Modi®cation of the hydrophilic substituents abolishes the bacteriostatic interaction with the ribosome (Hlavka & Boothe, 1985). Variations in the hydrophobic half involving the methyl groups of N4 at ring A and substituents at C5, C6 and C7 to C9 are permissible and provide a high probability of antibacterial activity (Sum et al., 1994). R1, R2 and R3 are H in 9glyTc. Both 7-chlorotetracycline (7ClTc, R1 is Cl) and tetracycline (7HTc, R1 is H) have hydrogen attached to C9, R2 is CH3 and R3 is OH.

The bulky and positively charged glycylamido substituent interferes with amino acid side-chains which were identi®ed by mutagenesis as sensitive to Tc recognition and to the mechanism of inducÈ tion (Muller et al., 1995). The crystal structures of TetR(D)/(Mg 7HTc) and TetR(D)/(Mg 7ClTc) will be denoted by their Brookhaven Protein Data Bank codes 2TRT and 2TCT, respectively. Induction of TetR(D) by 9glyTc We used a genetically truncated TetR(D) with the C-terminal amino acid residues 209 to 218 deliberately deleted. This variant allows an improved puri®cation protocol (Ettner et al., 1996) with enhanced crystallization properties compared with wild-type TetR(D). Quanti®cation of in vivo repression and induction ef®ciencies of wild-type and truncated TetR(D) showed that functionality is not impaired by the truncation (data not shown). The in vivo induction ef®ciency of 9glyTc was compared with that of 7HTc using high (Berens et al., 1992) and low TetR expression systems (Wissmann et al., 1991). Both tetracyclines lead to 100% induction in the low expression system, whereas induction by 9glyTc was about ®vefold reduced compared with 7HTc in the high expression sys-

Figure 2. Overall structure of the homodimeric TetR(D) with bound (Mg 9glyTc)2 (yellow van der Waals spheres). The entrance of the tunnel for the inducer was identi®ed next to a9H (blue with red Asp178H ; Orth et al., 1998), which wraps around the other half of the core domain and closes the entrance after Tc binding like a sliding door, moving towards Arg104 (cyan). Arg104 is part of the loop (cyan) connecting a6 and a7. The C-terminal turn of a6 is unwound after (Mg Tc)recognition to form a type II b-turn. The ¯exible loop indicated by discontinuous electron density connecting a8 and a9 is shown as black trace. Figures 2 and 3(a), (b) and (c) were prepared using MolScript (Kraulis, 1991) and Raster3D (Merritt & Murphy, 1994).

457 Tc position 6 with the aliphatic side-chain of Val113 (Kisker et al., 1995). Compared with this Tc analogue, 9glyTc binds 12 times weaker, which has to be associated with effects caused by interactions between TetR and the bulky and positively charged 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido) moiety. TetR interactions with the 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido) substituent The position and binding of the 9-(N,Ndimethylglycylamido) group is of interest as it has more demanding sterical requirements than substitutions on Tc ring D of determined crystal structures of TetR/(Mg Tc)-complexes. This substituent is covered by side-chains of Arg104, His151H and Met177H (Figure 3(b)), giving rise to differences in binding geometries compared with 2TRT and 2TCT, responsible for incomplete formation of the recognition pattern (Figure 3(b) and (c)). Met177H is in van der Waals contact with the 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido) group and prevents a9H (residues 168H to 178H ) from reaching the ®nal position for closing the entrance as described (Orth et al., 1998). The r.m.s. deviation for main-chain Ê atoms of a9H is slightly increased (0.45 A with respect to 2TCT), but main-chain atoms C terminal of a9H with the loop connection to a10H show r.m.s. Ê deviations of about 0.9 A (residues 178H to 180H ). In all crystal structures of TetR/(Mg Tc)-complexes, the side-chain of Arg104 forms a salt bridge to the carboxylate group of Asp178H at the C-terminus of a9H . In the TetR(D) complex with 9glyTc, the distance between the Ca atoms of Arg104 and Ê Asp178' is lengthened by 1.1 A, and the salt bridge is not abolished but weakened due to sterical requirements of the bulky and positively charged 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido) substituent. The CaÊ position of Arg104 is only shifted 0.21 A, but Ca of H Ê Asp178 shows the major displacement of 0.93 A with respect to 2TCT, referring to the sliding door function of a9H (Figure 2). Simulated annealing È omit maps (Brunger, 1991) resulted weak electron density for the side-chain of Arg104 indicating higher ¯exibility, whereas the short side-chain of Asp178H is well de®ned. The hydrogen bond between Arg104 Ne and O10 of the phenolic Tc ring D observed in 2TCT and Ê 2TRT has changed from about 3.3 A to a distance Ê of 5.24 A in the 9glyTc complex. As a compensation, in the 9glyTc complex the hydrogen bond Ê (3.39 A) of the phenolic O10 with the peptide oxyÊ Ê gen atom of Thr103 is 0.25 A and 0.38 A shorter than in 2TCT and 2TRT, respectively (Figure 3(b)). The hydrogen bond between peptide oxygen atom Gly102 O and the imidazole Nd of His151H (a8H ) mediates a stabilizing link to the induced b-turn of the Mg2 binding site. In the TetR(D)/ (Mg 9glyTc)2-complex, this hydrogen bond is Ê Ê lengthened to 3.42 A compared with 2TCT (3.01 A) Ê and 2TRT (3.05 A). In 2TRT and 2TCT, the imidazole plane of His151H forms a p-stack with the gua-

a6 determines the mobility of the DNA-binding domains required for operator recognition or release. Co-ordination of the imidazole group of His100 to the Tc-chelated Mg2 triggers C-terminal unwinding of a6 (residues 96 to 102) and induces formation of a type II b-turn (residues 100 to 103), thereby changing the relative orientation of a4. An extended network of hydrogen bonds tightens (Mg Tc) to the rigid part of the core (a5, a8, a10 and a5H , a8H , a10H ) and forces a4 and a4H with their N-terminal DNA-binding domains into a position, which prevents operator binding by separating the Ê recognition helices (a3, a3H ) at about 39 A. A stabilizing chain of water molecules (the ``water zipper''; Orth et al., 1998) between a4 and the loop connecting a6 and a7 was found, suggesting rigid orientation of a4. Variable Tc orientation Comparison between corresponding ring atoms of the Tc molecules bound to TetR reveals local r.m.s. deviations, increasing continuously from Ê Ê 0.15 A (7ClTc) and 0.32 A (7HTc) for ring A, to a Ê (7ClTc) and 1.14 A (7HTc) for Ê maximum of 0.43 A ring D. These data suggest a ®xed position of the Tc molecule for ring A stabilized by hydrogen bonds with amide O21, enolate O3 and dimethylammonium N4 to His64 (C-terminal to a4), Asn82 (a5) and Gln116 (a7) supported by the remarkable p-hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group O121 and the phenyl ring of Phe86 (a5). The anchoring of ring A by hydrogen bonds is also re¯ected by the averaged temperature factors of Ê 9glyTc, which increase from ring A (37 A2) to D Ê (46 A2), reaching the highest value for the ¯exible Ê 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido) moiety (58 A2). While Tc ring A is tightly ®xed to TetR, the plane de®ned by rings B, C and D experiences lateral shifts, depending on substitutions at positions 7 and 9 (see Figure 3(a)). The rings B, C and D interact mainly by van der Waals contacts with TetR, except for the Mg2 co-ordination site, which is variable to some extent due to the co-ordinating side-chains of His100 and Glu147H . Tc substitution pattern and binding constants The binding constant of 9glyTc to TetR (KA  0.64 Â 109 MÀ1) is about ®ve times lower than for 7HTc (Lederer et al., 1996), re¯ecting the in¯uence of the substituents in positions 6 and 9. In 9glyTc, the CH3 and OH groups at position 6 are replaced by hydrogen atoms, and in position 9 the 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido) group is attached. There are two kinds of interactions with opposite in¯uence. Deletions of substituents in position 6 reduce sterical requirements and increase repressor binding and inducibility as shown for 6-demethyl-6-deoxy-tetracycline, which binds even 2.4 times stronger to TetR than 7HTc (Degenkolb et al., 1991). This is explained by the deleted unfavourable contact of the hydroxyl substituent at

458 Ê nidinium of Arg104 at 3.5 A distance. In the 9glyTc complex, the stacking interaction is replaced Ê by an NH . . . p interaction at 3.5 A distance between the terminal N atom of the positively charged 9-dimethylammonium group and the imidazole of His151H (Figure 3(b)). Cation . .. p interactions with amino acid side-chains have been reported (Dougherty, 1996), but the higher B-factors of this substituent suggest that this is only a weak interaction. The additional positive charge of (Mg 9glyTc)2, with respect to (Mg Tc), causes no general problems in the recognition site, because the terminal NH(CH3)2-group is in contact with the solvent region at the entrance of the Tc binding tunnel. The plane of the peptide bond of the 9-(N,Ndimethylglycylamido) substituent is perpendicular to the attached phenolic Tc ring D. This conformation is stabilized by hydrogen bonding of the

carbonyl oxygen atom O91 to His139 Ne2 (a8) through a water molecule (see Figure 3(c)). A water molecule in a comparable position was also observed in 2TCT and 2TRT. In other known TetR classes, position 139 is represented by His or Tyr, with the ability to form this water mediated hydrogen bond. This additional Tc/TetR recognition can be interpreted as a compensation for weakened interaction to TetR, with respect to 2TCT and 2TRT. In 2TRT and 2TCT, the carboxylate of Glu147H (a8H ) is hydrogen-bonded to two water molecules of the Mg2 co-ordination sphere. In contrast, in the (Mg 9glyTc)2 complex of TetR(D), the carboxylate group of Glu147H is rotated by $90 , disrupting the hydrogen bond to one of the aqua ligands and to Gly102 NH at the ``top'' of the induced b-turn (Figure 3(c)). This orientation of the carboxylate group is reminiscent of the situation observed

Tc ring A is ®xed by hydrogen bonding (broken lines, for clarity only for the (Mg 7ClTc) complex) to His64 (a4), Asn82 (a5) and Gln116 (a7), whereas the BCD plane is mainly in van der Waals contact with TetR and can shift laterally. Note the different orientations of the carboxylate group of Glu147H . (b) Stereo view of the (Mg 9glyTc)2-recognition site with colour code referring to Figure 2. The induced b-turn (residues 100 to 103) is shown as a ball-and-stick model with the adjacent loop connection to a7. Hydrogen bonds are drawn as broken lines and thin lines indicate the octahedral Mg2 coordination. The 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido) substituent of 9glyTc is covered by side-chains of Arg104, His151H (suggesting a NH . .. p-hydrogen bond) and Met177H . Note the salt bridge Arg104 ... Asp178H , which still closes the entrance of the inducer binding tunnel. Side-chains of helix a8H form hydrogen bonds to the Mg2 binding site (Glu147H ) and stabilize the induced b-turn (His151H ). (c) View into the entrance of the (Mg Tc) binding tunnel with orientation and colouring according to Figure 2, to demonstrate differences in the hydrogen-bonding pattern between 2TCT and the TetR(D)/(Mg 9glyTc)2-complex. Arg104 and Asp178H are omitted for clarity. In 2TCT, the carboxylate group of Glu147H is hydrogen bonded to peptide Gly102 NH of the induced b-turn and to two Mg2 co-ordinating water molecules. In the 9glyTc complex, Glu147H contributes only to the stability of the Mg2 binding site, because the carboxylate group is rotated by $90 , interrupting two hydrogen bonds, which are formed in 2TCT (labelled with red crosses).

in the Tc-free, not induced TetR(D)-variant (Orth et al., 1998), indicating that the Tc chelated Mg2 with the water ligands has not reached its ®nal position, because the Tc framework is blocked at the entrance. Non-inducible TetR mutants All amino acid residues discussed with respect to the charged 9-(N,N-dimethylglycylamido) substituent interfere with Tc binding and/or induction ef®ciency as shown by mutagenic screening for È non-inducible mutants of TetR (Muller et al., 1995). Any mutation of Gly102 changes the direction of Gly102 NH in this segment of the polypeptide chain as the characteristic conformation of the induced type II b-turn has a preference for Gly in position 102. The missing hydrogen bond of Glu147H Oe1 .. . Gly102 NH at the top of the b-turn corresponds to decreased inducibility of Gly102 variants. Single point mutants with exchanged residues Arg104 or Asp178 have approximately three- to ®vefold reduced binding constants for (Mg 7HTc) compared with wild-type TetR, quantitatively in the same range as mentioned above for the binding of (Mg 9glyTc)2 to wild-type TetR. The sensitivity of TetR induction on the Arg104 . .. Asp178H salt bridge is associated with Arg104 being adjacent to

the induced b-turn. In the Arg104 variants the modi®ed side-chains in¯uence Tc recognition as they are part of the (Mg Tc) binding pocket, and correlate with formation and/or positioning of the preceding b-turn. Asp178H is located C-terminal to a9H , and variations of this residue interfere probably with the mobility of a9H for closing the entrance of the Tc binding tunnel after inducer insertion. Although residues 104 and 178 are not strictly conserved in the known TetR classes, sequence comparison showed that strong hydrogen bonding is obviously required to establish the properly closed Tc binding pocket in the induced structure (see Figure 1a of Kisker et al., 1995). Variants of His151 show decreased inducibility, because the hydrogen bond between Nd of the imidazole group and the peptide oxygen atom O102 is required to stabilize the induced b-turn of the Mg2 binding site. Since residue 177 is part of the hydrophobic recognition site for Tc ring D, variants show slightly reduced inducibility if a bulky hydrophobic sidechain is not present.

Overproduction and puri®cation of TetR(D) was performed as described for TetR(B) (Ettner et al., 1996). Solutions containing 10 mg/ml TetR(D) in 200 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) were incubated for 30 minutes at 30 C with ®vefold molar excess of (Mg 9glyTc)2. For crystallization, 10 ml of this protein solution were mixed with 5 ml reservoir solution containing 1 M ammonium sulphate, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and prepared for hanging drop vapor diffusion. Pale yellow crystals grew at 18 C within three weeks to a maximum size of 0.7 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm.

group of 9glyTc prevents formation of the induced TetR(D) conformation, like 2TCT and 2TRT. The Tc framework (Tc rings B, C, D) with the chelated Mg2 and co-ordinating water ligands cannot reach its ®nal position, causing incomplete and weakened hydrogen-bonding pattern within and around the inducer binding site. This is in agreement with quantitative induction experiments yielding reduced induction ef®ciency of TetR by 9glyTc.
