ABSTRACT: Escherichia coli DsbD transports electrons across the plasma membrane, a pathway that leads to the reduction of protein disulfide bonds. Three secreted thioredoxin-like factors, DsbC, DsbE, and DsbG, reduce protein disulfide bonds whereby an active site C-X-X-C motif is oxidized to generate a disulfide bond. DsbD catalyzes the reduction of the disulfide of DsbC, DsbE, and DsbG but not of the thioredoxin-like oxidant DsbA. The reduction of DsbC, DsbE, and DsbG occurs by transport of electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to the C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain of DsbD (DsbDC). The N-terminal domain of DsbD, DsbDN, acts as a versatile adaptor in electron transport and is capable of forming disulfides with oxidized DsbC, DsbE, or DsbG as well as with reduced DsbDC. Isolated DsbDN is functional in electron transport in vitro. Crystallized DsbDN assumes an immunoglobulin-like fold that encompasses two active site cysteines, C103 and C109, forming a disulfide bond between -strands. The disulfide of DsbDN is shielded from the environment and capped by a phenylalanine (F70). A model is discussed whereby the immunoglobulin fold of DsbDN may provide for the discriminating interaction with thioredoxinlike factors, thereby triggering movement of the phenylalanine cap followed by disulfide rearrangement.

Folding of secreted proteins within the periplasm of Escherichia coli requires the formation of disulfide bonds, a process that is dependent on the Dsb1 (disulfide bond) proteins. Disulfide bond formation occurs via oxidation of a pair of cysteine sulfhydryl groups, a reaction that is catalyzed by DsbA. Electrons generated by oxidative folding are transferred from DsbA to DsbB and channeled into the electron transport chain (1, 2) (Figure 1a). DsbA cannot provide a proofreading activity for improperly formed disulfides which are repaired by DsbC, DsbD, DsbE, and DsbG. For example, maturation of c-type cytochromes requires first oxidation and then reduction of two cysteine residues. The reduction of cystines within c-type cytochromes is catalyzed by DsbE (3, 4). Such redox rearrangement of the apocytochromes is needed to prevent random oxidation of the cysteines that are involved in the covalent attachment of heme. Reshuffling of incorrectly paired disulfide bonds of periplasmic proteins is also initiated by a reduction reaction that involves DsbC or DsbG (5, 6). In all of these reactions, DsbC, DsbG, and DsbE act as electron donors.

As no source of reducing equivalent is generated in the bacterial periplasm, Gram-negative cells have evolved a pathway whereby DsbD transfers electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH across the cytoplasmic membrane to DsbC, DsbE, and DsbG (Figure 1a) (7, 8). DsbC, DsbG, and DsbE exist in reduced [Dsb-(SH)2] and oxidized [Dsb-S2] states. Only reduced Dsb-(SH)2 can transfer electrons to target substrates. In these redox-active proteins, two sulfhydryl groups, -(SH)2, are positioned in a dithiol C-X-X-C motif. This motif was first characterized for thioredoxin, a small ubiquitous cytoplasmic protein that reduces disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm (9, 10). The crystal structures of both DsbC (11) and DsbE (12) reveal the presence of a thioredoxin-like domain bearing the redox active C-X-X-C motif. DsbG shares sequence similarity with DsbC and is therefore presumed to contain a thioredoxin fold. Furthermore, the C-terminal domain of DsbD, DsbDC (residues 450-546), resembles protein disulfide isomerase, another member of the thioredoxin superfamily. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of DsbD, DsbDN, and DsbDC, respectively, are located in the periplasm (13, 14), and each harbors a pair of cysteines, C103-C109 and C461-C464, respectively (Figure 1b). DsbDN and DsbDC are connected by eight transmembrane (TM) segments with three cysteine residues. Five out of the seven cysteines of DsbD are absolutely required for electron transport activity (C103, C109, C163, C285, and C461) (13). C163 and C285 are located in TM1 and TM4, respectively (Figure 1b). Previous work examined the mechanism whereby DsbD transfers electrons from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. Electron transfer mediated by DsbD was demonstrated by

Thiol-Disulfide Exchange in an Ig-like Fold

Biochemistry, Vol. 41, No. 22, 2002 6921 transfer electrons to C461 and C464 of DsbD, as substitution of C461 in the C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain of DsbD (C461-V-A-C) with alanine abolishes electron transfer. The C-terminal domain is assumed to transfer electrons to the N-terminal domain of DsbD, presumably by forming a disulfide between C109 and C461. Electron transfer also involves a reduction of the DsbC dithiol motif (C98-G-Y-C) and occurs between DsbC and DsbDN. Coexpression of DsbD C103A and DsbC C101A, but not of DsbC C98A or DsbD C109A, leads to the formation of a mixed disulfide species between the two Dsb proteins. Thus, the final step of DsbDmediated electron transfer likely occurs via thiol-disulfide exchange between C109 of DsbD and C98 of DsbC (16). All electron transfer steps examined for DsbD occur by a specific mechanism, i.e., the intramolecular exchange of thiol-disulfide bonds (15, 17). Thioredoxin (TrxA) transfers electrons to the transmembrane domain of DsbD. Electrons are transferred to DsbDC but not to DsbA, DsbC, DsbE, or DsbG, even though all of these proteins contain a thioredoxin-like fold. Specificity may be solely achieved by proximity of the two domains and the intramolecular nature of the reaction. Electrons are then transferred to DsbDN. DsbDN selectively transfers electrons to DsbC, DsbE, and DsbG but not to DsbA or DsbB (16). DsbDN functions as an adaptor unit that permits electron transfer between thioredoxin moieties but avoids futile electron cycling between reductants such as DsbC or DsbG and the oxidant DsbA. Nonetheless, DsbDN itself must possess redox qualities of thioredoxins as its sulfhydryls must be able to receive and donate electrons very rapidly. We have crystallized DsbDN and describe structural features that likely contribute to the remarkable redox properties of the active site cysteines. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Purification. The nucleotide sequence encoding DsbDN was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the following 5- and 3-primers: gtttttgccggtccttcgacgcgccg and aagaattcacaattgcgcggtgggctg, respectively. The fragment was cloned in vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) using the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI. The protein was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase N-terminal DsbD (GST-DsbDN) fusion protein in E. coli using DH5R cells. Ten milligrams of protein was obtained from an 8 Lculture induced at an OD600nm of 0.2 with 1 mM IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol, and broken in a French press. DsbDN was recovered with the total soluble proteins by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100000g. This soluble fraction was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Pharmacia), and washed with 10 volumes of buffer. DsbDN was cleaved from bound GST by thrombin digestion as described by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). Cleaved DsbDN was further purified over mono-Q-Sepharose using 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.4, and eluted with a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 250 mM. DsbDN eluted at 30-50 mM NaCl. Mass spectrometry analysis of DsbDN revealed a mass of 16073, which corresponds to the expected mass for the 144 amino acid protein domain (16072.78). As predicted from the cloning procedure, the DsbDN sequence initiates with the expected Gly followed by Ser instead of Leu. Crystallization and Structure Determination. Initial crystallization of purified DsbDN was carried out by concentrating

FIGURE 1: Model for disulfide bond formation and rearrangement catalyzed by Dsb proteins of E. coli. (a) Known Dsb proteins in the E. coli system. DsbA oxidizes disulfide bonds of newly translocated proteins. The transmembrane protein DsbB accepts electrons from DsbA and transfers them to quinone or menaquinones embedded in the bilayer. DsbC and DsbG are disulfide isomerase proteins that catalyze the re-formation of incorrectly formed disulfide bonds. DsbE is thought to reduce the cysteines of aopcytochrome c for heme attachment (anchoring of DsbE in the plasma membrane is not depicted on the figure). These three proteins accept electrons from the cytoplasm through the DsbD transmembrane protein. (b) Model for DsbD-mediated transfer of electrons across the cytoplasmic membrane. TrxB (NADPH) donates electrons to the active site dithiol motif of TrxA, C32-XX-C35. C32 of TrxA interacts with C163 of DsbD. This presumably resolves the disulfide between C163 and C285 of DsbD (represented as a gray broken line). In the next step, C163 and C285 presumably donate electrons to the dithiols at C461 and C464. The reduced dithiol of C461 attacks the disulfide at C103 and C109, which transfer electrons to the oxidized dithiol motif of DsbC. The square-shaped box indicates the presence of a thioredoxin-like fold. Dark arrows indicate the steps supported by experimental data whereas gray arrows indicate steps presumed to occur.

isolating reaction intermediates that are tethered by a disulfide bond between redox-active proteins (15). Such extremely short-lived intermediates can be captured using redox proteins containing only half of the redox-active site. Substitution of DsbD C285 with alanine and TrxA C35 with serine (C32-G-P-S35) led to the production of a stable complex. Characterization of this complex showed that the two proteins are trapped in a mixed disulfide species with a disulfide bond between C32 of TrxA and C163 of DsbD, suggesting that TrxA resolves a disulfide between C163 and C285 of DsbD. Upon TrxA-mediated reduction, C285 must

Goulding et al. C-X-X-C motif undergoes reversible oxidation-reduction and is present in all members of the thioredoxin superfamily. The primary sequence of DsbDN does not display sequence similarity with thioredoxin, and DsbDN is not predicted to assume a thioredoxin-like fold. Further, DsbDN does not harbor the characteristic C-X-X-C motif. Comparison of several different DsbD-like proteins revealed the presence of a Q-G-C103-X5-C109-Y sequence motif within DsbDN (Figure 2a), where C109 is implicated in the redox reaction that transfers electrons from DsbD to DsbC (15). Purified, recombinant DsbDN was able to transfer electrons and hence reduced oxidized DsbG in vitro (data not shown). When used in substoichiometric amounts over DsbG, DsbDN could still reduce oxidized DsbG provided stoichiometric amounts of the purified and reduced C-terminal domain of DsbD, DsbDC, were added to the reaction mixture (data not shown). Together, these data suggested that DsbDN is a functional domain, as it is capable of accepting electrons from DsbDC and transferring them to DsbG. OVerall Structure of DsbDN. DsbDN is a single domain that consists of four antiparallel sheets, two of which form a -sandwich (Figure 2b). The initial 3 residues (1-3) and the last 21 residues (124-144) are presumably disordered. The -sandwich consists of two larger antiparallel -sheets, each of which has three strands ( 1, 2, 8 and 4, 10, 12, respectively). On one edge of the -sandwich is an elongated segment of seven residues (residues 57-63, between 5 and 6) and two -sheets, one near the N-terminus and the other near the C-terminus of DsbDN. The residues of the elongated segment have the backbone torsion angles consistent with a -strand. Nonetheless, this elongated segment is not hydrogen bonded to the neighboring -strand ( 5); instead, the hydrophobic side chains point into the core of the protein. At the N-terminal end of DsbDN, the fivestranded antiparallel -sheet is reminiscent of a partial -barrel ( 6, 7, 3, 10, 11). At the C-terminal end is another short antiparallel -sheet which consists of three -strands ( 5, 9, 13). The only helical secondary structure is a four-residue R-helix (R1) located at the beginning of -strand 1, which lies against the five-stranded -sheet (Figure 2b). The Ramachandran plot shows that all residues except two, Q26 and D79, are in the allowed region. The model locates residues Q26 and D79 in a -turn, which fits the electron density map extremely well. Structural Features of the ActiVe Site. Noticeably, the structure of DsbDN displays two striking features. First, the two cysteines, C103 and C109, which have been shown to be essential for activity, form a disulfide bond between strand 10 and strand 11 (Figure 2b). The distance between the two S atoms of C103 and C109 is 2.05 ( 0.05 Å, which is consistent with a disulfide bond linking the two residues (normally 2.030 Å) (28). The closest side-chain atoms to the disulfide bond are the aromatic ring carbons of F70 (3.34 Å); OH of Y42 (3.55 Å) and OH of Y40 (4.37 Å); O of D68 (5.07 Å); NH2 of Q101 (5.12 Å); and Y71 (6.19 Å) (Figure 2c). With the exceptions of F70 and Y71, which appear to be interchangeable in position, all of these residues are conserved among homologues of DsbDN as shown by the sequence alignment in Figure 2a. Another region of conserved residues is found in the first R-helix (R1) near the active site, where the aromatic ring of F18 is pointing toward the active site contributing to its surrounding hydrophobic

The crystals were swiped through a solution of 20% glycerol and crystallization buffer (1:1) before mounting and collecting data under cryoconditions. Potassium iodide soaks were performed with 0.5 M potassium iodide in the cryoprotectant. The crystals were soaked for 1 min before mounting under cryoconditions. An iodo derivative of the DsbDN crystal diffracted to 2.3 Å, and a native crystal diffracted to 1.65 Å with cell dimensions of 53.21 × 55.63 × 102.05 Å with one monomer per asymmetric unit in space group C2221. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (18). SIRAS phasing proceeded by the usual methods of heavy atom location [SHELXD (http:// shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELXD/)], maximum likelihood phase refinement [ML-PHARE (19)], and density modification [DM (20)]. Phase extension to 1.65 Å permitted automated model building with ARP/wARP (21) of all of the residues of DsbDN except the initial 3 residues (1-3) and the last 21 residues (124-144). Model building was done in O (22), and the model was refined using SHELXL. Data and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Structure and Sequence Analysis. BLAST (23) and CLUSTALW (24) were used for database searches and multiple sequence alignments, respectively. Pairwise alignments were calculated using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. Similar protein structures were searched using DALI (25) and aligned with combinatorial extension (CE) (26). Figure 2b is illustrated using SETOR (27). RESULTS Members of the thioredoxin superfamily display small amounts of sequence similarity and are predicted to assume similar three-dimensional folded structures. An active site

environment. Notably, nearly all of the conserved residues are located in or around the active site. The second striking feature is the loop region between strands 6 and 7, which lies over the disulfide bond between C103 and C109 of the active site. Both 6 and 7 strands are located on the five-stranded -sheet (appearing in red in Figure 2b). These residues are also in a conserved region of the protein (Figure 2a). In particular, the aromatic ring of F70 within this loop region is situated approximately 160° across from the disulfide bond within this partial -barrel. F70 forms an aromatic-sulfur interaction with the S atom of C109 with a 62° angle and may contribute to the stability of the disulfide bond. This loop lies over the otherwise exposed active site cysteine residues. As C109 is "capped" by F70, we think it is plausible that the loop protects the active site from illegitimate redox reactions and refer to this region as the "cap" of DsbDN. Our model implies that structural displacement of the cap from the active site must occur prior

to reduction of the disulfide bond of DsbDN by DsbDC. Further, electron transfer between DsbDN and its protein substrates DsbC, DsbG, and DsbE may also involve a mechanism that requires cap displacement. Overall, the disulfide bond is stabilized by S- interactions via four aromatic rings from residues F70, Y40, Y42, and Y71, and C103 has a strong hydrophobic interaction with Y42 (29). The N- and C-termini of DsbDN are located at the opposite ends of the elongated domain. This is not unexpected as the N-terminal is the cleavage site for the signal peptide, and the C-terminal disordered strand is anchored to the hydrophobic transmembrane core of DsbD. It is noteworthy that the electrostatic molecular surface potential at the C-terminal end of DsbDN is hydrophobic, whereas the surface around the active site five-stranded partial -barrel is negatively charged with arginine side chains protruding at the surface.

performed with the DALI server, identified proteins that are involved in cell membrane-adhesion and membrane-interacting proteins. The closest structural homologue of DsbDN was found to be the ap-2 clathrin adaptor R subunit with a Z-score of 7.1 (30). Also, there are structural similarities to invasin, immunoglobulins, and major histocompatibility proteins. The fold of DsbDN is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This family of fold is normally comprised of a single -sandwich, whereas DsbDN contains two additional antiparallel -sheets. The structural homology search gave no positive results for proteins that function as a thioldisulfide oxidoreductant, as does DsbDN. DISCUSSION Proteins with similar function often share evolutionary relationships that can be revealed by similarities in their tertiary structures. Redox reactions involving reversible thiol-disulfide exchanges are often carried out by dithiols arranged in a C-X-X-C motif within a thioredoxin-like fold. Three of the Dsb proteins have been shown to have thioredoxin folds, including E. coli DsbA (31), DsbC (11), and the DsbE homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12). Sequence homology (24% identity) suggests that the structure of DsbG is similar to that of DsbC. Presumably, the C-terminal domain of DsbD also adopts a thioredoxinlike fold. Conversely, some thioredoxin-like domains do not carry any redox activity. Protein disulfide isomerase contains four thioredoxin folds, of which two are redox inactive with no C-X-X-C motif (32). In E. coli and other organisms, thioredoxin is maintained reduced by thioredoxin reductase (TrxB). TrxB is not a member of the thioredoxin superfamily. Electrons are transferred from the C135 and C138 of TrxB to thioredoxin (33). Recycling (reduction) of C135 and C138 is achieved intramolecularly by an accessory domain that uses flavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor. Much like TrxB, DsbDN does not belong to the thioredoxin superfamily. DsbDN obtains reducing equivalent intramolecularly from a thioredoxin-like domain (DsbDC) and in turn reduces three thioredoxin-like proteins. To our knowledge, the redox

activity of DsbDN is the first of its kind for an immunoglobulin-like fold. As for thioredoxin, DsbDN-mediated thiol-disulfide oxidoreduction is achieved by formation of mixed disulfide intermediates between the first cysteine of thioredoxin-like domains and C109 of DsbDN. C109, the active thiolate and its redox partner, C103, are located on two separate, short, antiparallel -strands (Figure 3a). How does the active site of thioredoxin-like proteins compare with that of DsbDN? Active site thiolates of thioredoxin-like proteins are stabilized by electrostatic interactions with local positively charged residues and presumably by an R-helix "dipole" (34-36). In the thioredoxin fold, the C-X-X-C motif is always located at the N-terminus of the R-helix dipole, and the second cysteine is the third amino acid of the R-helix (Figure 3b). The first thiol has an unusually low pKa value, and it has been suggested that the electrostatic field associated with the R-helix pointing with its N-terminus toward the cysteine residue is in part responsible for lowering the thiol pKa value by up to 5 pH units in glutaredoxin and DsbA (35, 36). In thioredoxin, the thiolate form of C32, which is essential for the nucleophilic attack, is stabilized by an interaction with the thiol hydrogen of C35. The preference for deprotonating C32 before C35 arises in part because of the greater solvent exposure of C32, due to its location before the R-helix (34). Other reports have concluded that redox properties of the thioredoxin-like protein, i.e., propensity to contain a thiolate at the active site, may be influenced by the two amino acids (X-X) surrounded by the two cysteines in the active site (CX-X-C) (37, 38). Obviously, the contribution of the helix dipole does not account for the thiolate form of C109 of DsbDN. However, a close look at the active site suggests that, in DsbDN, C109 thiolate is stabilized by a hydrogenbonding network and electrostatic interactions strikingly reminiscent of those of thioredoxins (Figures 2c and 3). Numerous residues surrounding C103 and C109 in the structure are conserved among DsbD homologues. These highly conserved amino acids are boxed in yellow in Figure 2a. Assuming that, as for thioredoxins, the structure of reduced

FIGURE 4: Reduction mediated by DsbDN: a possible mechanism. (1) The thiolate form of the solvent-accessible C109 performs a nucleophilic attack on the oxidized target protein, DsbC, leading to an intermolecular disulfide bond between C109 of DsbDN and C98 of DsbC. (2) Proton transfer between C103 and D68 is mediated by the hydroxyl group of Y42 and triggers the nucleophilic attack of C103 on the mixed disulfide bridge. (3) Release of reduced DsbC and oxidized DsbDN.

DsbDN is similar to that of oxidized DsbDN, the closest sidechain atoms to the cysteines will be the hydroxyl groups of Y42 (3.55 Å), Y40 (4.37 Å), and Y71 (5.32 Å) (Figure 2c). The oxygen and hydroxyl group of D68 lie at 5.42 Å from the sulfhydryl of C109. D68 is conserved in all but one amino acid sequence of DsbD homologues (Figure 2a). Helix R1 near the active site is also composed of conserved amino acids. The conserved sequence E69FYGK73, between strand 4 and 5, appears as a loop capping the active site cysteines C103 and C109, and the aromatic ring of F70 lies directly over C109 of the disulfide bond (2.48 Å). This capping appears to protect the disulfide bond, which would be otherwise solvent exposed and susceptible to nucleophilic attack (Figure 2b). DsbDN receives electrons from DsbDC and reduces oxidized DsbC, DsbE, and DsbG. DsbDC, DsbC, DsbE, and DsbG must all displace the "E69FYGK73" cap, allowing for preferential deprotonation of C109 over C103 which remains buried. The thiolate form of C109 performs a nucleophilic attack on oxidized DsbC, leading to an intermolecular disulfide bridge (Figure 4, step 1) (15, 17). We propose that this event is followed by proton transfer between C103 and the conserved D68 and subsequent nucleophilic attack on the mixed disulfide bridge (Figure 4, step 2). This is followed by release of reduced DsbC and oxidized DsbDN (Figure 4, step 3). This model is reinforced by studies using thioredoxin showing that a conserved aspartic residue (D26) serves as a proton transfer catalyst for thioredoxin's C35 thiol during the formation and breakdown of mixed disulfide intermediates (39). A water molecule may possibly mediate proton transfer between D26 and C35 (40). The distance between these two residues is 6 Å (41), which is very close to the 5.1 Å measured between the carboxyl group of D68 and the sulfur atom of C103 in DsbDN (Figure 3a). Further, we propose that in DsbDN proton transfer between D68 and C103 is mediated by the hydroxyl group of Y42, instead of a water molecule. The distance between the sulfur atom of C103 and the hydroxyl group of Y42 is 3.51 Å, and it is 2.69 Å between

the hydroxyl group of Y42 and the carboxyl group of D68 (Figure 3a). We note that a conserved aspartic residue, D95, can also be observed in the structure of DsbC (11), in the vicinity of the buried C101 (Figure 3b). The side chains of these two residues are separated by 6.2 Å. In the reduced form of DsbDN, C103 and Y42 must move slightly nearer, allowing proton transfer to occur between the three residues (Figure 4, step 2). Also, the hydrophobic environment of the active site disulfide bond will enhance the transfer of electrons and protons within the partial -barrel. This suggested catalytic diad between D68 and Y42 is reminiscent of the well-known catalytic triad of serine, histidine, and aspartic acid found in serine proteases. 5-3-Ketosteroid isomerase is another enzyme containing similar residues in the catalytic site (three tyrosines, two aspartates) (42). How does DsbDN select it substrates as compared to DsbC or DsbA? DsbC shares structural features with DsbA, including a helical insert in the thioredoxin fold. This helical insert is smaller in the case of DsbC, and it is not clear what its role might be (11). Both DsbA and DsbC contain a cleft to accommodate potential substrates. The architecture of these clefts is very different. The DsbA cleft is thought to bind substrate peptide (31) and is absent in DsbC. Unlike DsbA, DsbC is a homodimer with a much larger, uncharged broad cleft, lying at the interface of the homodimer (11). It has been hypothesized that this uncharged cleft permits binding of unfolded proteins. Loose binding of unfolded polypeptides may allow the proteins to experience various conformations for the correct disulfide bonds to form. It is unclear from our data whether DsbDN interacts with DsbC in a similar manner. However, it is possible that the cap region of DsbDN may contact this region of DsbC during catalysis, as would a nonfolded substrate. In DsbDN, electron transfer between thioredoxin folds is mediated by an unrelated fold closely related to the immunoglobulin fold. The cysteines in this immunoglobulin-like fold are less promiscuous than those in the thioredoxin fold,

6926 Biochemistry, Vol. 41, No. 22, 2002 as no mixed disulfides have been observed between DsbDN and random proteins containing dithiol-disulfide groups (15). Immunoglobulin-like folds are not uncommon in the periplasm of E. coli. PapD, a chaperone involved in assembly of PapK pilin subunits, contains an immunoglobulin fold (43). The crystal structure of the PapD-PapK chaperonesubunit complex revealed that the chaperone functions by donating one -strand to complete the immunoglobulin-like fold of the subunit, via a mechanism termed donor strand exchange (44). This stable interaction prevents premature oligomerization of a pilus subunit such as PapK, until export at the PapC outer membrane protein export site. However, since interactions between DsbDN and its redox partners are transient, it is unlikely that strand exchange is required to bring the two folds together. In another immunoglobulin-like fold, that of the chaperone Caf1M from Yersinia pestis, oxidation of two cysteine residues is thought to activate the chaperone activity of Caf1M (43, 45, 46). Oxidation is mediated by DsbA (46, 47) on two cysteines located on two successive -strands, as predicted from the structure of PapD. Caf1M is a periplasmic chaperone involved in the assembly of composite adhesive pili. Thus, this is an example of a protein predicted to have an immunglobulin-like fold (Caf1M) that interacts with a thioredoxin-like protein (DsbA) to become active. Unlike DsbDN, however, Caf1M is not itself redox active, as it does not oxidize any substrates subsequently. Clearly, the DsbDN immunoglobulin-like fold is a variation of a common fold that has developed a relatively new electron-transporting function, perhaps uniquely tailored to provide reducing equivalents for thiol-disulfide exchanges coupled to protein folding in bacterial cells. In a pathway of interacting thioredoxin-like partners, DsbDN is shown to adopt a completely different three-dimensional structure; nonetheless, it carries a very similar function and strikingly an almost identical catalytic site. This is likely an instance of convergent evolution where two proteins evolved independently, quite like the bacterial protease subtilisin and trypsin proteases which have a very similar geometry of residues in their active site but no structural similarities (48, 49). The structure of DsbDN and its proposed mechanism will allow for careful probing of the residues that catalyze reduction and oxidation of the active site cysteines. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank K.
