b2-Glycoprotein I (b2GPI) is a highly glycosylated phospholipid-binding plasma protein comprised of four complement control protein (CCP) domains and a distinct fifth domain. The structural organisation of human and bovine b2GPI in aqueous solution was studied by smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Low-resolution models that match the SAXS experimental data best were independently constructed by three different ab initio 3D-reconstruction algorithms. Similar elongated S-shaped models with distinct side-arms, which were correlated to the position of the carbohydrate chains, were restored from all three algorithms. Due to an additional glycosylation site located on the CCP2 domain of bovine b2GPI a small change in the characteristic SAXS parameters was observed, which coincided with results obtained from SDS ­PAGE. In comparison to the human analogue the corresponding restored lowresolution models displayed a similar S-shape with less bending in the middle part. As the experimental SAXS curves fit poorly to the simulated scattering curves calculated from the crystallographic coordinates of human b2GPI, the crystal structure was modified. First, additional carbohydrate residues missing from the crystal structure were modelled. Second, on the basis of the low-resolution models, the J-shaped crystal structure was rotated between CCP3 and CCP2 assuming the greatest interdomain flexibility between these domains. An S-shaped model with a tilt angle of , 608 between CCP3 and CCP2 yielded the best fit to the experimental SAXS data. Since there is evidence that b2GPI can adopt different conformations, which reveal distinct differences in autoantibody recognition, our data clearly point to a reorientation of the flexible domains, which may be an essential feature for binding of autoantibodies.

activity.26 To address this issue, we carried out small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments of b2GPI in aqueous solution, and we have restored three-dimensional structural models of b2GPI that were compared to the crystal structure solved recently by Bouma et al. and our group.9,10 The explicit differences of the overall shape between crystal and solution structure are attributed to carbohydrate units and to the flexibility of the CCP domains. The impact of a conceivable domain reorientation with respect to immunological activity and the structural differences between human b2GPI and its bovine analogue are discussed.

Results
Small-angle X-ray scattering parameters SAXS raw data from human b2GPI (h-b2GPI) and the final desmeared SAXS profiles of h-b2GPI and bovine b2GPI (b-b2GPI) are shown in Figure 1. The radius of gyration (RG) of b2GPI in aqueous solution decreases slightly with increasing concentration in the range RG ¼ 4.3 ­4.1 nm for h-b2GPI and RG ¼ 4.4 ­4.2 nm for b-b2GPI. This concentration-dependence of the radii of gyration is consistent with weak interparticular interactions. After extrapolation to infinite dilution, the final values of RG ¼ 4:30 nm for h-b2GPI and RG ¼ 4:46 nm for b-b2GPI from the Guinier approximation are obtained. These values are in good agreement with the RG values derived from the p(r ) function of the scattering profiles of the extrapolated curves (see Table 1). The maximal particle dimensions derived from RG and Rxs are L ¼ 13:6 nm and 14.0 nm for h-b2GPI and b-b2GPI, respectively. The scattering profiles for h-b2GPI and b-b2GPI indicate similar shapes for both proteins (r.m.s ¼ 0.04), which is seen also in the distance distribution functions p(r ) (Figure 1, inset). The molecular masses (MM), MM ¼ 53:5 kDa for h-b2GPI and MM ¼ 58:0 kDa for b-b2GPI estimated from I(0) are in good agreement with values obtained from SDS ­ PAGE, i.e. 55.1 kDa and 58.1 kDa, respectively (Figure 2). The volumes for the hydrated protein V ¼ 96 nm3 and V ¼ 110 nm3 for h-b2GPI and b-b2GPI, respectively, are close to the volumes obtained from low-resolution models (see the next paragraph) and are twice the dry volume Vd ¼ 46 nm3 calculated for the crystal structure of h-b2GPI (1C1Z.pdb) (Table 1). A large hydrated volume in comparison to the dry volume is characteristic for elongated proteins.27 In our case, the hydrated volume is even enhanced by the high glycosylation rate of b2GPI. It can thus be concluded that the solution of b2GPI is monodisperse, and the scattering profiles can be further used for ab initio shape analyses.

CCP4 and domain V) or four residues (between the other domains). The four N-terminal CCP domains exhibit a conserved elliptically b-sandwich structure. They are highly homologous to each other and to the other representatives of this superfamily. In contrast, domain V folds into a central b-spiral with two small helices and carries a distinct positive charge in the proximity of the surface-exposed loop region. b2GPI shows a high affinity for negatively charged ligands, including heparin, DNA,11 cell membranes, endothelial cells,12 macrophages13 or acidic phospholipids. Complexes formed by b2GPI and acidic phospholipids were suggested to act as antigens for autoimmune phospholipid autoantibodies (aPLAs) associated with clinical events such as antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus erythematosus, and recurrent fetal loss.14 ­ 16 The aberrant domain V is believed to bind to negatively charged phospholipids,17,18 whereas CCP1 and CCP4 are suggested to comprise aPLAs binding sites.19 ­ 21 Recent studies reveal that the N-terminal domains CCP1, CCP2, and CCP3 are involved in the formation of specific protein clusters,22,23 which can be recognized by aPLAs.24 It has been argued that, upon epitope exposure in a ligandassociated state, the protein has a conformation different from that in the water-soluble state,21,25 in which b2GPI displays a reduced immunological

Determination of low-resolution models for human and bovine b2GPI Overall shape restoration from solution scattering data for human and bovine b2GPI was achieved by two different ab initio methods, namely DAMMIN28 and DALAI_GA.29 In both procedures, only SAXS profiles up to qmax ¼ 2:6 nm21 for h-b2GPI and qmax ¼ 3:2 nm21 for b-b2GPI were used for the fits. In DAMMIN, ten independent shape determinations were performed within a spherical search volume of Dmax ¼ 14:0 nm for both proteins. The packing radius of the dummy atoms was 0.375 nm. The restored models for h-b2GPI yield RG ¼ 4:26ð^0:01Þ nm; Dmax ¼ 13:4ð^0:05Þ nm and V ¼ 105ð^2Þ nm3 and display an S-like shape with a cross-section diameter of about 2 nm, as expected for a CCP domain (Figure 3(a)). The restored models for b-b2GPI have RG ¼ 4:34ð^0:08Þ nm; Dmax ¼ 13:7ð^0:2Þ nm and V ¼ 113ð^2Þ nm3 (Figure 3(b)). The main structural features are depicted by superposition of five restored models with one template structure (Figure 3(c) and (d)). Despite differences in the structural details between the superimposed models, consistence was achieved in the location of side-arms, which are marked by arrows in the Figure. The side-arms most probably indicate the position of the N-linked carbohydrates attached to the protein. In DALAI_GA, the same scattering profiles were used after manually subtracting a constant according to Porod's law for homogeneous particles in order to be consistent with DAMMIN, where this is done automatically. Ten independent

shape determinations were performed within an initial ellipsoidal search volume of a ¼ 15 nm; b ¼ c ¼ 8 nm for both proteins. The packing radius of the dummy beads was 0.4 nm. The restored models yielded RG ¼ 4:21ð^0:03Þ nm; Dmax ¼ 13:3ð^0:1Þ nm and RG ¼ 4:25ð^0:06Þ nm; Dmax ¼ 13:9ð^0:5Þ nm; for h-b2GPI and b-b2GPI, respectively. A comparison with results from DAMMIN illustrates that the individual models from DALAI_GA are less packed, with more details and significantly reduced number of beads (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The observed differences in the compactness are caused by the fact that no connectivity restrictions during the shape determination were used. The reduced number of beads, which results in a smaller volume of the model, is caused by differences in the calculation of the scattering intensity by either the multiphase or the Debye formula.30 However, the five superimposed models displayed in surface representation in Figure 4(c)

Figure 3(b) and (c) and with dark dots in Figure 5(a) and (b). Modification of the crystal structure of human b2GPI based on the low-resolution models The theoretical SAXS profile and the p(r ) function calculated from the crystallographic coordinates of h-b2GPI (1C1Z.pdb) by the program CRYSOL32 are shown in Figure 6(a) and (b) (dotted lines). First, the discrepancy (r.m.s ¼ 0.13) between the calculated and the experimental scattering profiles shows explicit differences. In general, the shapes of the p(r ) functions are typical for elongated particles. However, the p(r ) function calculated for the crystal structure shows a higher anisotropy in comparison to the p(r ) function obtained from solution experiments. The first maximum at r ¼ 1:9 nm in the p(r ) function from the crystal structure correlates well with the crosssection value of the CCP domains. The maximum of the p(r ) functions from experimental data, however, is shifted to higher distances r , 3.8 nm, whereas the first maximum at r ¼ 1:9 nm is still preserved as a shoulder. These results indicate

and (d) reveal a remarkable similarity to the models restored by DAMMIN. As already mentioned, only the low-resolution part of the scattering profile (low angles) was used to determine the shape of b2GPI. In order to include the higher-resolution part of the X-ray scattering pattern (up to qmax ¼ 4:0 nm21 ) for structural modelling, the program GASBOR31 was used, applying the modifications that are necessary for a glycoprotein and are given in Materials and Methods. This program fits the experimental scattering profiles successfully, with r.m.s values of 0.013 ^ 0.01 and 0.029 ^ 0.02 for h-b2GPI and b-b2GPI, respectively. For better illustration, Figure 5(a) and (b) presents a model for both proteins as obtained by GASBOR shape determination. Again, the overall shapes of the single restored models are similar and resemble the models restored by DAMMIN and DALAI_GA, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. Note the similarity in the location of side-arms marked with arrows in

that in comparison to the crystal structure the solution structure of h-b2GPI is more bulky but still elongated. Hence, it is essential to model the carbohydrate residues that are missing from the crystal structure. In particular, four carbohydrate chains were attached to the residual carbohydrate chains already detected in the crystal structure. The carbohydrate chains were modelled in differ-

ent folding states, whereas the unfolded chain with the highest solvent contact was determined as the configuration with the best fit (r:m:s ¼ 0:015) (Figure 6(a), broken line). A higher value taken for the contrast of the hydration layer ðdrb ¼ 60 e nm23 Þ results in a further slight improvement of the fit in the high q-range of the scattering curve.

The crystal structure of h-b2GPI (left) is shown in comparison to the atomic model with complete carbohydrate chains and transformed according to the best fit to the experimental data (right). The secondary elements, b-strands and a-helix of the structure are shown as a continuous ribbon in blue and red, respectively. The four N-linked carbohydrates attached to the residues Asn143, Asn164, Asn174 and Asn234 drawn in allatom mode are: -GlcNAc-GlcNAcMan-(Man-GlcNAc-Gal-NeuAc) 2 (GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Man, mannose; Gal, galactose; NeuAc, N-acetylneuraminic acid ! sialic acid). The atomic model is additionally displayed in transparent surface presentation.

modified crystal structure with the added carbohydrates is displayed in Figure 6(b) (broken line). Although an improvement of the fit to the experimental data is achieved, a discrepancy for q . 0.6 nm21 is observed. In this q-range, however, the influence of the scattering from the overall structure is still dominant. In order to improve the fit, one has to take into account the bending of the molecule. The differences in bending between the low-resolution models and the crystal structure most probably arise from different tilt and twist angles between the CCP domains. Accordingly, the crystal structure was rotated between domains CCP3 and CCP2, a region where remarkably little buried interface surface area was observed. The Ile121 backbone, where the b-strand of the domain linker shows a short random coil, was chosen as the most suitable rotation bond between CCP3 and CCP2. The RG and r.m.s values calculated for 36 models, which differ in the rotation angle in the Ile121 backbone, are shown in Figure 6(c). The model with 08 rotation represents the modified crystal structure with added carbohydrate chains. The model with a rotation angle of 1308 shows the best fit to the experimental profile ðr:m:s ¼ 0:004Þ and the calculated RG value, RG ¼ 4:29 nm21 ; is almost identical with the experimental value, RG ¼ 4:30 nm21 : The excellent fit of the calculated scattering profile for the model rotated by 1308 to the experimental data as well as the almost identical p(r ) functions (Figure 6(a) and (b) continuous lines) are a clear indication for a different bending of h-b2GPI molecule in the crystal and in solution. The final model obtained by rotation (1308) displays an S-shaped structure (Figure 7) and closely resembles the low-resolution models. The tilt angle between CCP3 and CCP2 calculated for the structure with the best fit to the experimental SAXS data is , 608, whereas from the crystal structure an extremely low tilt angle of , 208 was

calculated. Additional evidence for the reliability of the solution structure determination arises from the fact that the calculated SAXS parameters (RG, Dmax, V ) for the rotated model are in much better agreement with the experimental values (Table 1). Table 1 shows the MM values calculated from the crystal structure and from the models of h-b2GPI in comparison to the experimental data. The MM calculated for the crystal structure including the carbohydrate chains is 45.7 kDa. This is considerably less than the MM of 55.1 kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE, which may be higher in the case of glycoproteins.33,34

Discussion
Differences between crystal and solution structure of human b2GPI The experimental scattering profile fit poorly to the simulated curve calculated from the crystallographic coordinates of h-b2GPI. This fact, as well as the disagreements in the corresponding p(r ) functions, indicate differences in the overall shape of h-b2GPI in crystal and solution. From the SAXS parameters in Table 1, it is obvious that the solution structure is less elongated and more bulky. Due to the highly conserved structure of b2GPI subunits (CCP domains þ domain V), changes in the overall shape can be attributed to different domain orientations only in the case of a monomeric solution. To obtain additional information, three ab initio modelling approaches were applied to fit the experimental scattering profile. The corresponding low-resolution solution structural models were restored. It should be noted that the single models presented here show variations between independent runs with similar goodness of fit and hence demonstrate that the SAXS shape

92

determination does not lead to unique solutions. However, the superimposed models display a consistent overall structure, which confirms that the information content in the scattering profiles justifies the ab initio modeling. Further, it should be stressed that the models obtained by GASBOR (Figure 5), although they display the location of Ca atoms, are of low resolution, i.e. 1.6 nm, which is defined by the range of data fitting. However, it was possible to distinguish between main structural features and side-arms. The side-arms in the models can be attributed to the carbohydrate units attached to the asparagine residues 164, 174, and 234. These three carbohydrate units are in close vicinity to each other, which results in a bulky structural feature seen by SAXS. After attaching the missing carbohydrates to the crystal structure, a significant improvement in the fit of the calculated scattering profile as well as of the p(r ) function of h-b2GPI to the experimental data was achieved (Figure 6(a) and (b)). However, we considered the fit not sufficiently good. Accordingly, the J-shaped crystal structure was modified, applying a rotation at the most suitable interdomain linker bond (Ile121) (Figure 7). The analysis of various models rotated in increments of 108 revealed that, in agreement with the low-resolution models, an S-shaped structure shows the best fit to the experimental data. This model yields a tilt angle of , 608 between CCP3 and CCP2, which is in disagreement with the , 208 calculated from the crystal structure. Low tilt angles of , 208 are extremely rare,35 whereas tilt angles of , 608 are likely to be a common structural feature in proteins with CCP domains, e.g. in human factor H (HFH 15 ­16 ¼ 50(^ 13)8),36 measle virus binding protein (CD46 1 ­2 ¼ 60(^ 15)8),37 vaccinia virus protein (VCP 3 ­ 4 ¼ 59(^ 4)8)38 and in b2GPI between CCP3 ­ CCP4 (, 608). In conclusion, it can be postulated that under nearly physiological conditions, b2GPI is more bent and forms an averaged S-shaped solution structure despite domain oscillations. However, the exact characterization of the domain orientation in a system of five domains connected with four flexible linkers is not reasonable. A potential reason for an overall shape of h-b2GPI different from the crystal structure might be the very high ionic strength used during the crystallization procedure (I ¼ 6 M). High ionic strength destabilizes the interdomain hydrogen bonds and, accordingly, the crystal packing is dominated mainly by intermolecular hydrophobic interactions involving CCP1, CCP2 and domain V, resulting in a J-shape. The results presented here for h-b2GPI suggest that crystallization conditions as well as the crystal packing forces might affect the orientation of protein subunits in the crystal. Differences between human and bovine b2GPI In view of the scattering profiles and the p(r ) functions shown in Figure 1, an overall shape simi-

larity between b-b2GPI and h-b2GPI is obvious. Further evidence for a similar tertiary structure is given by the 83% homology in the amino acid sequence and the four characteristic CCP domains with identical numbers of disulfide bonds followed by one lipid-binding domain.39 However, in the present work, the small increase of size in the experimental and model parameters for b-b2GPI compared to h-b2GPI (Table 1) indicates a more bulky shape of b-b2GPI. These results are in good agreement with data from SDS ­ PAGE (Figure 2) in which the molecular mass for b-b2GPI was about 3 kDa higher compared to h-b2GPI, probably caused by an additional Asn73 N-linked carbohydrate.39 To summarize, the restored low-resolution models of b-b2GPI displayed a similar S-shape with less bending in the central part.

Functional implication The structure of b2GPI in solution as presented here exhibits a well defined spatial orientation and, due to the flexibility of the interdomain linkers, can adopt an optimal spatial and entropic conformation through bending. However, the structure is not necessarily conserved. For example, in other cases, like in factor H, which is composed of 20 CCP domains, the solution structure exhibits a mixture of different domain orientations driven by the fact that five longer linkers (up to eight amino acid residues each) permit a positional variation of the overall structure.40 Thus, proteins consisting of CCP or similar domains can adopt different conformations, where the variations depend critically on the flexibility and length of the linkers and on certain spatial restrictions.41,42 The solution structure determined for b2GPI under nearly physiological conditions can put into perspective different hypotheses for interaction of b2GPI with membranes or aPLAs. In the literature, some studies stress that binding of b2GPI to acidic phospholipids alters the secondary structure of the protein slightly, thus exposing autoepitopes,21,25 whereas others advocate that dimerisation or clustering of b2GPI43,44 is essential for bivalent binding of aPLAs.45,46 Only recently, it was shown that dimeric chimers of b2GPI have a much higher affinity for phospholipids.24 From this point of view, the solution structure represents the free, not immobilized structure, which is described as immunologically less active.26 It is conceivable that transitions between conformational states directly correlate with the functional activity of the protein. Immobilisation or cross-reacting of b2GPI domains due to ligand binding22 may cause the exposure of cryptic epitopes19 ­ 21,47 and reorientations of CCPdomains, probably required for aPLAs interaction. If so, this "bending" and "stretching" of the b2GPI molecule could provide a mechanism for its biological control.

Despite the limited resolution, SAXS is certainly a useful tool to investigate the tertiary structure of complex proteins in solution. This is of great importance as the solution structure is sensitive to conformational changes, which are fundamental for the physiological role of a protein. In our case, the structures of the glycoprotein obtained by X-ray crystallography and solution scattering are quite different. With the help of SAXS measurements, we could model carbohydrate residues that are not resolved in the crystal structure. By analogy, this method could be applied to predict the spatial orientation of a homologous structure that has is not been solved by X-ray crystallography.

Materials and Methods
Protein isolation and purification b2GPI was isolated from citrated human or bovine plasma as described.1,48 In brief, the protein was purified by affinity column chromatography, dialysed exhaustively against Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.4) and finally dialysed against NH4HCO3 before lyophilization. The preparation was virtually 100% pure as judged by SDS ­ PAGE, yielding a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 55.0 kDa for h-b2GPI and 58.1 kDa for b-b2GPI. The protein was dissolved in 50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mM NaCl before use. The protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA assay, Pierce, The Netherlands). Small-angle X-ray scattering Measurements were carried out using a Kratky compact camera (Hecus MBraun, Graz, Austria),49 equipped with a thermostatically controlled sample holder. The measurements were performed at 20 8C using a quartz capillary with a volume of 60 ml and an inner diameter of 1.0 mm. Protein concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg/ml were used. A Ni-filtered primary X-ray beam was generated by a water-cooled rotating Cu-anode generator (Rigaku Corp., Japan). The sample to detector distance was 272 mm and the position calibration of the detector was performed using Ag-stearate as a standard. Scattering curves were monitored in a q-range from 0.14 to 4.0 nm21 ðq ¼ 4psin u=lÞ; with 2u being the scattering angle and l ¼ 0:15418 nm (Cu Ka radiation) being the wavelength of the X-ray. Exposure times were typically 3600 seconds for individual measurements. The scattering of the buffer was subtracted after absorption correction and the difference scattering curve was normalized to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The normalized curves were extrapolated to zero concentration using standard procedures.50 The final composite scattering curve was obtained by merging the low-angle data (0.14 , q , 0.8 nm21) extrapolated to zero concentration with the high-angle data (0.8 , q , 4.0 nm21) recorded at a high concentration (30 mg/ml). The resulting scattering data were subjected to indirect Fourier transformation using the program GNOM,51 which performs a desmearing of the raw data with the slit-width, and slit length, profiles of the primary beam from the slit collimation. Radii of gyration (RG) were further determined by Guinier approximation from the low q-regions

RG and Rxs were used to analyze the triaxial dimensions of b2GPI where the length of the particle is L ¼ ½12ðR2 2 G R2 Þ1=2 : For an elongated particle, L < Dmax can be xs assumed. The scattering profiles in the range up to qmax ¼ 4:0 nm21 were used to compute the volumes V of the hydrated particles.50 V ¼ 2p2 ðIð0Þ=QÞ; where Q is the invariant according to Porod.54 The program GNOM was used to compute the pair-distance distribution function p(r ), which represents the probability of finding a point within the particle at a distance r from a given point. Integrating this probability over the surface of the sphere of radius R and over the volume V yields the p(r ) function as expressed by: ð 1 1 pðrÞ ¼ rqIðqÞsinðrqÞdq ð3Þ 2p2 0 This offers an alternative calculation of RG and I(0) that is based on the full scattering curve,50 and gives the maximum dimension of the macromolecule Dmax, as the distance where the p(r ) function approaches zero. Ab initio deconvolution of the SAXS profile The low-resolution shapes of b2GPI were restored from the experimental data by two independent ab initio shape-determination programs, DAMMIN28 and 29 DALAI_GA. Scattering profiles up to qmax ¼ 2:6 nm21 for human and qmax ¼ 3:2 nm21 for bovine b2GPI were used for the fit. DAMMIN calculates the scattering intensities from a multiphase model of a particle built up from a finite number of dummy beads that are characterized by the configuration vector assigning the beads to a specific phase or to the solvent. DALAI_GA calculates the scattering intensities of a given molecular structure defined by dummy beads (assuming the homogeneous electron density) according to the Debye formula.55 More detailed information about the approaches used for the calculation of scattering intensity from beads models can be found in the literature.28,29 Each method starts searching for a model in a volume filled by uniformly hexagonally packed beads with dimensions selected according to the resolution of the scattering profile and taking into account the dimension of the initial search object. DAMMIN searches for the best model configuration, minimizing the discrepancy function: f ðXÞ ¼ x2 þ aPðXÞ ð4Þ

between the calculated and experimental curves using the simulated annealing method.56 Here, x is the discrepancy between calculated and experimental curve, and aP(X ) is a looseness penalty with positive weight a . 0. The idea of this method is to modify the coordinates of beads randomly, while always approaching the configurations that decrease the energy f(X ). DALAI_GA uses a genetic algorithm57 for iterative fitting of the

is assigned. The models are combined using genetic operators in such a way that the better fits have a higher probability of "reproducing". The repeated genetic operators to the fittest models increase the average fitness of the population. This process is repeated until the system converges or a good enough model is found. To improve the resolution and reliability of models, an additional ab initio modelling approach, GASBOR was used.31 This procedure fits the scattering profiles up to qmax ¼ 4:0 nm21 and hence shows the highest resolution for the b2GPI models ð2p=qmax ¼ 1:6 nmÞ: GASBOR uses a simulated annealing approach to find a chain-compatible spatial distribution of an exact number of dummy residues that corresponds to the distribution of Ca atoms of amino acid residues. The calculation of the scattering intensity from the model is based on the Debye formula.55 In this fitting approach, the numbers of amino acid residues of the protein have to be specified. In the case of a glycoprotein, the contribution of the scattering from carbohydrates has to be taken into account. Due to different mean electron densities ðrÞ of carbohydrates and proteins, the number of carbohydrate residues has to be adjusted the following way in order to be counted as amino acid residues Nresidues ¼ Ncarbohydrate residues ðrcarbohydrate 2 rbuffer Þ= ðrprotein 2 rbuffer Þ where Nresidues and Ncarbohydrate residues are the numbers of amino acid residues and carbohydrate residues, respectively. r of protein and buffer were set to rprotein ¼ 447 e nm23 and rbuffer ¼ 334:5 e nm23 ; respectively.58  The r of carbohydrates can be calculated from z(electron concentration in e g21) and the partial specific volume (v2), according to  r ¼ zðv2 Þ21 NA £ 10221 : ð7Þ

Application of theoretical SAXS profiles in crystal structure modification The crystallographic coordinates with PDB-code 1C1Z9 were used as an atomic model of human b2GPI. The theoretical scattering curve from the crystal structure was calculated using the program CRYSOL,32 which surrounds the macromolecule by a 0.3 nm thick hydration layer with a slightly greater electron density than the solvent.63 The final scattering intensity is calculated as the addition of scattering of the particle in vacuum and the hydration layer followed by subtraction of scattering from the excluded volume. The program either calculates the scattering profile or fits the experimental data whenever the average excluded volume per atomic group ra and the contrast of the hydration layer drb are adjustable parameters to minimize the discrepancy between experimental and calculated curves. This fitting approach was used to match the modifications done within the crystal structure to the experimental scattering profile. Structural modifications include rotation of CCP domains and attachment of sugar units. The modifications were carried out using the program WebLabViewerPro 4.0 (Accelrys Inc.). Domain orientation Domain orientations, specified by tilt angles, have been evaluated for crystal and atomic models as follows. For the CCP1 domain, the inertia tensor was calculated and diagonalised. The main unitary vectors z with origin in the center of mass were aligned along the major axes of the inertia tensor. CCP domains 2 ­4 and domain V were superimposed with CCP1. Superposition of the CCP domains was performed by the program SUPCOMB64 using Ca positions of spatially related residues. The related unitary vectors z0 for each domain were calculated from the transformation matrix obtained by superimposing procedures. The tilt angle 1 between neighbor domains is given by the angle cosð1Þ ¼ zz0 calculated for the neighbour domains. Definition of the tilt angle 1 is according to Bork et al.35

In particular, human b2GPI has four N-linked carbohydrate units attached to the Asn residues 143, 164, 174, 2349,10 (see the legend to Figure 7). Bovine b2GPI shows glycosylation sites identical with that of an additional site located on Asn73.59 According to the deglycosylated derivatives60 prepared enzymatically, a similarity between all carbohydrate units with a complex type can be assumed. Nevertheless, the possibility of a slight heterogeneity in sialylation cannot be excluded.61  The electron concentration z ¼ 0:534 e g21 and the partial specific volume v2 ¼ 0:63 cm3 g21 62 for the carbohydrate units give the mean electron density of rcarbohydrate ¼ 510:4 e nm23 : Applying equation (6), the 44 and 55 carbohydrate residues located in four h-b2GPI and five b-b2GPI carbohydrate chains consequently correspond to 69 and 86 amino acid residues, respectively. The goodness of fit for all three above-mentioned ab initio methods was measured using the root mean square
