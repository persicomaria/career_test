Abstract p97 (VCP, Cdc48), a type II AAA+ ATPase family member, is ubiquitous, essential, highly abundant, and involved in a diverse range of biological functions with roles in membrane fusion, endoplasmic-reticulum associated degradation, transcriptional activation, and cell cycle control. As such, dysfunction of this protein has serious pathological consequences and has been implicated in a variety of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. p97 has a large number of adaptor proteins through which it transmits energy from ATPase activity to conformational changes which are then exerted onto target proteins. p97 has been studied by a variety of biochemical and structural techniques at various resolutions and stages throughout its ATPase cycle. From these studies, many models have been proposed and consequently a single model for p97's action cannot be suggested. Many questions about the mechanism of p97 still remain, including whether the protomers act in a concerted manner and crucially how the induced changes in p97 are transmitted to its adaptor proteins and target substrates. The elucidation of p97's mechanism is not only important in furthering our knowledge of this intriguing protein and its many functions, but subsequently in the development of potential therapies for diseases associated with p97 dysfunction. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction AAA+ ATPases are spread widely throughout all kingdoms of life (Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001). Their function is associated with motor-like activities and many of them undergo large conformational changes in order to transform chemical energy stored in the form of ATP into mechanical movement. The characteristic AAA cassette comprises »250 residues and members of the AAA+ family usually form oligomeric rings. Classical AAA proteins additionally contain a second region of homology or SRH (Lupas and Martin, 2002). Type I AAA+ ATPases have a

single AAA domain (e.g., ClpX, HslU, and PspF), whereas type II AAA+ ATPases have two AAA domains (e.g., p97, NSF, Pex1, Drg1, ClpA, and ClpB) (Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001). The past 10 years have seen an explosion in structural studies of AAA+ ATPases by using the full range of tools available to the structural biology community: X-ray crystallography, Electron microscopy (EM), Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). In addition, several biochemical and biophysical studies have been conducted to unravel these proteins' mechanism of action. This has not bypassed p97, a prominent member of the AAA ATPase family originally termed VCP for valosin-containing protein (Koller and Brownstein, 1987) and later p97 (Peters et al., 1990). This protein is highly conserved across species with orthologues in Xy (TER94) (Pinter et al., 1998), yeast (Cdc48) (Frohlich et al., 1991; Moir et al., 1982), archaea (VAT) (Pamnani et al., 1997), plant (Feiler et al., 1995), and protozoa (TbVCP) (Roggy and Bangs, 1999) and is highly abundant within the

cell (Peters et al., 1990). p97 is implicated in a number of diVerent cellular processes including membrane fusion (Uchiyama and Kondo, 2005), ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (Bays and Hampton, 2002), transcription factor processing (Rape et al., 2001), and spindle disassembly after mitosis (Cao et al., 2003). The yeast Cdc48 is also associated with cell cycle progression (Frohlich et al., 1991) and protein refolding (Thoms, 2002). These functions are usually achieved in conjunction with adaptor proteins that are thought to transmit conformational change from p97 to substrate molecules. Many diVerent adaptor/binding proteins have been described for p97 (e.g., Indig et al., 2004; Kondo et al., 1997; Meyer et al., 2000; Nagahama et al., 2003; reviewed in Dreveny et al., 2004b) and Cdc48 (e.g., Hartmann-Petersen et al., 2004; Schuberth et al., 2004), while none have been identiWed yet for the archeal homologue VAT. Originally, it was thought that p97 could only bind to one adaptor at a time and this targeted p97 to a speciWc pathway (Meyer et al., 2000). The heterodimeric Ufd1-Npl4 adaptor, for example, is implicated in ERAD (Hitchcock et al., 2001; Rabinovich et al., 2002; Ye et al., 2001). The trimeric p47 adaptor is thought to act in membrane fusion (Kondo et al., 1997; reviewed in Uchiyama and Kondo, 2005), but p47 yeast orthologues have also been reported to be involved in proteolytic events (Hartmann-Petersen et al., 2004; Schuberth et al., 2004). Nuclear envelope formation requires both Ufd1-Npl4 and p47 (Hetzer et al., 2001). Although there is no evidence to suggest that Ufd1-Npl4 and p47/Shp1 bind to p97 simultaneously, other p97/Cdc48 cofactors have been shown to bind at least transiently alongside p47 (e.g., VCIP135 (Uchiyama et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004)) and Ufd1-Npl4 (e.g., Ufd2 (Richly et al., 2005), Ubx2 (Schuberth and Buchberger, 2005)). Each protomer of the p97 hexamer consists of three domains: the N-terminal double ­ barrel domain, which

is generally the adaptor binding domain, is followed by two AAA domains termed D1 and D2, each composed of an / and an -helical sub-domain (Fig. 1). This conWguration results in 12 nucleotide binding sites arranged around a central pore in two stacked rings of six (D1 and D2). The long linkers between the N, D1, and D2 domains could provide a route for propagation of conformational change and/or communication of nucleotide state. Furthermore, the active sites reside at the protomer:protomer interface, which could allow for communication within rings during the course of the ATPase cycle. Hydrolysis of ATP is probably achieved by the nucleophilic attack of the -phosphate by an activated water molecule. The reaction is thought to proceed via a penta-coordinated transition state to yield ADP and inorganic phosphate (Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001), although no strong data for associative versus dissociative hydrolysis mechanism exists at present. The phosphate leaving group is likely to be stabilised by Mg2+ ions. Mg2+ has never been observed in any of the p97 crystal structures, but this could be due to limited resolution and/ or crystallisation conditions (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Dreveny et al., 2004a; Huyton et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2000). Sensor residues are proposed to detect the presence of the -phosphate group of the ATP and initiate conformational change. High-resolution structures of other AAA+ proteins suggest that Walker A motif residues form interactions with the Mg2+ and the nucleotide's phosphate groups through conserved lysine and threonine residues. The lysine forms ionic interactions with the - and -phosphate oxygens and the threonine interacts with the Mg2+ ion. The Walker B motif, characterised by the DEXX sequence, is implicated in Mg2+ coordination in the case of the aspartate and the glutamate residue is believed to activate the water molecule for nucleophilic attack. Mutation of the conserved glutamate residue to glutamine therefore typically decreases ATPase activity signiWcantly and so is

generally referred to as a `hydrolysis deWcient mutant', whereas mutation of the Walker A lysine to alanine decreases the binding aYnity for nucleotide and is referred to as a `nucleotide binding deWcient mutant'. Both are extensively used to search for in vivo and in vitro functional eVects of mutant proteins. In this review we have collated the information currently available on p97's ATPase mechanism and potential cooperativity between and within rings. We also summarise the proposed models of how ATP hydrolysis is coupled to conformational changes that are then transmitted to adaptor proteins and substrate molecules. 2. Nucleotide state The interpretation of the nucleotide state of p97 in experimental structures is key to understanding the conformational changes of p97 throughout its ATPase cycle. As p97 has 12 potential active sites there are many possible ordered and random mechanisms by which it could bind and hydrolyse ATP. Four crystal structures of full-length p97 have been determined showing ADP always bound to D1 while D2 can be empty, bound to an ATP analogue (AMPPNP), a transition state analogue (ADP-AlF3) and ADP (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Huyton et al., 2003). At lower resolution, EM and SAXS structures were determined in conditions with an excess of ADP, AMPPNP, and ADP-AlF3 (Beuron et al., 2003; Davies et al., 2005; Rouiller et al., 2000, 2002; Zhang et al., 2000). 2.1. The determination of nucleotide state of p97 in structures Ideally high-resolution crystal structures would allow the assignment of nucleotides to structures using the electron density obtained. In the case of the D1 domain, ADP is unambiguously assigned. However, low-resolution together with possible partial disorder has made this assignment more problematic in D2 (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Huyton et al., 2003). Additionally, the exact quantiWcation of the occupancy of nucleotides is also hindered by the resolution limit of the p97 crystal structures obtained so far (3.5­4.7 Å). For example, the ADP-AlF3 structure was initially interpreted with 6 ADP-AlF3 moieties bound but following the inclusion of higher resolution data diVerent occupancies of ADP-AlF3 within the D2 ring were observed (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005). The lower resolution of electron microscopy 3D reconstructions (>18 Å) prevents the nucleotide state of p97 samples from being directly observed. This is circumvented by incubating samples with saturating quantities of nucleotide (typically 5 mM of nucleotide to less than 10 M p97). The assumption is then made that all available sites are saturated with nucleotide. This approach does not provide information of the nucleotide state as it cannot be assumed that all 12 p97 nucleotide binding sites have high aYnity for the `saturating' nucleotide and does not take into account whether nucleotide is already bound to p97. Using current knowledge of

probable nucleotide binding states we later suggest a likely assignment of nucleotide state (see Section 2.2). From the SAXS data (8.6 Å) alone it is impossible to directly observe the nucleotide bound, since only a molecular envelope is obtained (Davies et al., 2005). This was overcome by Davies and co-workers using HPLC analysis of nucleotides released from denatured proteins (Davies et al., 2005). Native p97, with no exogenous nucleotide added, showed that ADP was nevertheless present and could be removed by treating the protein sample with apyrase. Adding saturating quantities of ADP or AMPPNP respectively doubled the ADP peak or led to an equal mixture of AMPPNP and ADP. This approach does not prove the locations of the bound nucleotides, but is consistent with the nucleotide states observed in the crystal structures (ADP bound to D1 and exogenous nucleotide bound to D2). Interestingly, when the experiment was repeated on the ND1 p97 fragment, full exchange of the D1 ring was observed when AMPPNP was added (i.e., all ring was AMPPNP) which led to the suggestion that in full-length p97, D2 exerts an inhibitory eVect towards D1 preventing it from showing activity. In conclusion, compared to the other low-resolution studies, the samples used for SAXS were characterised better in terms of the starting nucleotide state and eVect of nucleotide addition. However, the biochemical information obtained by Davies and co-workers in conjunction with other data can inform predictions as to the actual nucleotide state of the EM samples after their various treatments. 2.2. Biochemical data for the analysis of p97 nucleotide states Mutational analysis of p97 has suggested that both AAA domains can contribute to the ATPase activity, with D2 appearing to contribute the bulk of activity (Song et al., 2003; Ye et al., 2003), however, it remains a possibility that the mutations made in D1 could allosterically aVect the activity of D2. As some measurements of ATPase activity suggest that D1 is relatively inactive compared to D2, it has been suggested that D1 bound to ADP acts as a hexamerisation domain whereas D2 is the main ATPase domain (Song et al., 2003). However, as both D1 and D2 are active to some extent, this implies that both domains can in principle bind to both ATP and ADP. It seems likely that ADP binds tightly to D1 as all crystal structures show ADP bound to D1 (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Dreveny et al., 2004a; Huyton et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2000) and HPLC analysis of urea denatured p97 used in SAXS experiments (Davies et al., 2005) showed that ADP was bound to p97 when no exogenous nucleotide was added. However, another study showed through HPLC analysis of heat denatured p97 that no nucleotide was present in p97 (Wang et al., 2003b), so it remains controversial that ADP is always bound to D1 in every preparation. The ability of D2 to bind AMPPNP, ADP-AlF3, and ADP, as observed in crystal structures (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005), is consistent with biochemical data.

HPLC analysis of urea denatured p97, previously incubated in a high concentration of AMPPNP, shows that it binds to p97 together with ADP (Davies et al., 2005), compatible with the structure of AMPPNP bound to D2 and ADP bound to D1. Furthermore, Wang and co-workers observed an increase in tryptophan Xuorescence when ADP or ATP was added to p97 originating from the nucleotides binding to the D2 domain. No changes in Xuorescence could be observed resulting from the D1 domain binding nucleotide (Wang et al., 2003b). Isothermal titration calorimetry data showed that half of the 12 sites were available for ADP binding which was interpreted as binding to D2 (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003). Assuming that the nucleotide binding properties of p97 are similar under the diVerent conditions used in the studies, we tentatively speculate that EM and SAXS structures of p97 with an excess of AMPPNP, ADP-AlF3, and ADP, may have ADP bound to the D1 domain and the added nucleotide bound to the D2 domain. 2.3. DiVerent occupancies of nucleotide in D2? DeLaBarre and Brunger (2005) interestingly observe incomplete occupancy of D2 in the presence of the transition state analogue ADP-AlF3. Unequal occupancy of the D2 ring has a far reaching impact on the mechanism of p97, suggesting that instead of a concerted approach, where all D2 domains bind, hydrolyse, and release together and identically, p97 could have a `binding change' mechanism as suggested for RuvB and F1 ATPase in which binding and hydrolysis proceed in a rotary sequence (Boyer, 1997; Hishida et al., 2004). The crystal structure is limited by low-resolution but is compatible with Wndings of Zalk and Shoshan-Barmatz (2003). Using a photoreactive ATP molecule (Bz-ATP) that can covalently crosslink to proteins upon exposure to UV light it was shown that endogenous p97 (puriWed from brain extracts) could bind to Bz-ATP in a positively cooperative manner (Hill coeYcient 1.6) with an apparent Kd of 90 nM. A stoichiometry of 2­3 Bz-ATP molecules binding per hexamer was determined. It remains possible that covalently binding nucleotides to p97 sterically inhibits further binding or alters the conformation of p97 preventing the observation of the real stoichiometry. The data are also diYcult to interpret unambiguously as the starting state of p97 had not been characterised nor the eVects of the two domains separated. Also it is diYcult to explain why then in the AMPPNP crystal structure equal occupancy of D2 has been observed (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005), so the unequal occupancy in D2 is still a matter for debate. 3. Communication: between rings vs between protomers 3.1. Communication between rings Hexameric type II AAA+ proteins can exhibit interrelationships between the two AAA rings, either one ring

is a degenerate AAA domain mostly responsible for hexamerisation while the other is an active ATPase (e.g., NSF (Matveeva et al., 1997)) or both cooperate as ATPases (e.g., Hsp104 (Hattendorf and Lindquist, 2002)). Both models have been proposed for p97 on the basis of ATPase assays performed by removing the activity of one domain at a time by mutation. Song et al. (2003) found that mutating the Walker B motif of D2 decreased the observed activity dramatically whereas the analogous mutation in D1 did not yield such a large eVect. They concluded that D2 contributed the bulk of ATPase activity and, based on protease digests and hexamer reassembly assays, the D1 domain is important for hexamerisation (Wang et al., 2003a,b). Conversely, Ye et al. (2003) found that similar mutations in both domains decreased activity comparably, concluding that the two rings act cooperatively. Without further studies using the same mutations and buVer conditions etc. it is uncertain which interpretation is correct. Interestingly, for wild-type p97, the ATPase data can be Wtted to a cooperative equation, giving a Hill coeYcient of 1.2 (although no Wtting statistics were supplied to validate this choice) (Song et al., 2003). This suggests there may indeed be some positive cooperativity although it is unclear whether this is between D1 and D2 or between protomers. Analysis of cryo-EM structures by quantised elastic deformational model supports a modelling where the D1 and D2 rings negatively cooperate with each other such that hydrolysis only occurs in one domain at a time (Beuron et al., 2003). If the two rings cooperate, it is likely that communication of nucleotide binding state could be through conformational changes in the linker connecting D1 to D2 (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003; Huyton et al., 2003). The mostly unstructured linker contains hydrophobic residues that contact the respective adenine ring and also a signature of two consecutive glycine residues (Smith et al., 2004). These glycine residues could possibly act as pivot points for transmission of conformational change (Smith et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2000). 3.2. Communication between protomers Some oligomeric AAA+ ATPases show cooperation within the AAA ring (e.g., RuvB), possibly mediated through alterations in the protomer:protomer domain interface and speciWcally through conserved arginine Wngers that contribute to the active site of the neighbouring AAA domain (so-called trans elements) (Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001). Asymmetric mechanisms have also been proposed for ClpX (Martin et al., 2005). In p97, each AAA domain has the potential to contribute two arginine side chains to the neighbouring protomer. It seems feasible that the two arginine Wngers of each D2 domain may be important to coordinate nucleotide hydrolysis within the D2 ring especially as mutation of these residues completely abolishes ATPase activity while leaving nucleotide binding intact (Wang et al., 2005).

To probe communication between protomers, Wang et al. (2005) assembled hybrid hexamers of wild-type and mutant p97 by two diVerent methods. First, they disassembled wild-type p97 with high concentrations of urea and reassembled the hexamers with increasing amounts of D2 Walker A mutant (K524T, deWcient in nucleotide binding) while maintaining a constant amount of wild-type p97. If activity remained the same, it would suggest that all D2 domains were independent; however, it led to a 50% decrease in activity, suggesting that there is some form of communication between the protomers (Wang et al., 2003a). The second method used to create hybrid hexamers of K524T and R635A or R638A was co-expression of the two mutants together. Each mutant, previously characterised as having no ATPase activity, was tagged with a diVerent tag, allowing it to be shown that mixed hexamers were indeed present, although there was no attempt to quantify what ratios were present in the hybrids. Mixed hexamers showed an ATPase activity of 10% of wild-type p97, presumably resulting from the contribution of R635 or R638 from K524T protomers to the functional binding site of R625A or R638A protomers allowing hydrolysis (Wang et al., 2005). These experiments show that the D2 domains are not independent of each other but lack the necessary controls for speciWc ratios in hybrid hexamers that would allow detailed insights into the mechanism of p97. Mutations can change the structure locally, which could also have longrange structural eVects. Despite observations in one crystal structure (p97-ADP-AlF3) (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003) of these residues pointing inwards towards the nucleotide of its own protomer, it seems likely that the D2 arginines do contribute to the neighbouring binding site. The diYculties of positioning side chains accurately at the limited resolution of the full-length p97 crystal structures solved so far also prevent detailed analysis of the active site residues. 4. Oligomerisation of p97 The activity of p97 is dependent upon hexamerisation, as monomeric p97 is inactive (Wang et al., 2003a), however, is the converse true? Wang and co-workers showed that p97 could assemble into a hexamer independently of added nucleotide but the rate of reassembly was increased by the addition of nucleotide. This eVect was dependent on the D1 domain being competent at binding nucleotides. Using non-hydrolysable nucleotide analogues and hydrolysis deWcient mutants of p97, it was shown that this eVect was a function of binding alone and not hydrolysis (Wang et al., 2003a). Thus, hexamerisation is not dependent on nucleotide binding or hydrolysis, but nucleotide binding to D1 increases the rate of hexamerisation. 5. Regulation of p97's activity through allosteric eVect The Wnding that p97's activity is dependent upon hexamerisation was also corroborated for the Arabidopsis p97

orthologue, AtCdc48, (Rancour et al., 2004), consistent with residues from adjacent protomers forming the active site assisting in the hydrolysis reaction. PUX1 (Plant UBX domain-containing protein 1) has been identiWed as an interactor of AtCdc48 that upon binding disassembles the p97 hexamer. This protein was able to act in an allosteric manner to inhibit AtCdc48 activity through inducing monomerisation (Rancour et al., 2004). It has also been reported that the presence of another UBX domain containing protein and a major p97 adaptor, p47, can decrease p97's activity signiWcantly (Meyer et al., 1998). Although the oligomerisation state of the p97­p47 complex was not assessed during the ATPase assay, it seems unlikely that this inhibition was a result of disassembly of the hexamer, as the p97­p47 complex is very stable. The other major adaptor, Ufd1-Npl4, does not show any eVect on p97's activity (Bruderer et al., 2004). 6. Snapshots along the ATP hydrolysis cycle of p97 To gain insight into the conformational changes that occur in p97 during the binding, hydrolysis and product release of nucleotide, a number of structural studies have been undertaken. By EM, SAXS, and crystallography p97 has been viewed in excess of ADP, AMPPNP, ADP-AlF3, and with no nucleotide added (Beuron et al., 2003; Davies et al., 2005; DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Huyton et al., 2003; Rouiller et al., 2000, 2002; Zhang et al., 2000). The exact nucleotide state has been determined for SAXS samples, viewed in crystal structures and assumed for EM structures. All structures in diVerent nucleotide states obtained so far are summarised in Fig. 2. 6.1. The `ATP' state As ATP would be rapidly hydrolysed by any ATPase in the time frame of most structural studies, `non-hydrolysable' nucleotide analogues are regularly used to mimic the `ATP' state to avoid rapid turn-over. The most common are AMPPNP and ATP- -S, both of which substitute N or S respectively for the O linking the - and -phosphate. It should be noted that while these analogues are possibly the nearest that we can get to a substrate­enzyme complex, the substitution alters hydrogen-bonding interaction patterns, bond angles and lengths and additionally low levels of hydrolysis may occur. Furthermore, AMPPNP is more unstable and in acidic conditions readily degrades (Dawson et al., 1986). AMPPNP however, is still chosen to replace ATP as ATP- -S is reported to hydrolyse slowly but in a time frame relevant to crystallisation studies. It has been suggested that incubation of p97 with ATP analogues is likely to result in binding to the D2 ring while D1 remains bound to ADP (see Section 2.2). Structural data available for this state of the molecule vary extensively. Starting with low-resolution techniques, there are two independent reports of cryo-EM 3D reconstructions. The Wrst cryo-EM 2D maps showed that AMPPNP binding induced

A summary of available structural data from diVerent techniques on p97 in diVerent nucleotide states (Beuron et al., 2003; Davies et al., 2005; DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Huyton et al., 2003; Rockel et al., 2002; Rouiller et al., 2000, 2002).

the largest conformational change, resulting in a rotation of large parts of the hexamer (Rouiller et al., 2000). Subsequent 3D reconstructions (Rouiller et al., 2002) showed no density for N domains and an open pore of the D1 and D2 rings, very similar to the no nucleotide state (see Section 6.4), in contrast to earlier observations (Rouiller et al., 2000). In a diVerent study (Beuron et al., 2003), it was shown that in the presence of AMPPNP the N domains appear located above the plane with a closed D1 ring pore and an open D2 ring pore. All cryo-EM experiments were carried out with protein in the presence of excess of the respective nucleotide. In the `most probable' SAXS model derived from data to a resolution of 8.6 Å (Davies et al., 2005) the N domains are located below the plane of D1, with an open D1 ring and a narrower D2 ring pore. In the latter case the nucleotide state has been assessed by HPLC and showed the presence of AMPPNP and ADP in the p97 sample that had been incubated with AMPPNP. In the crystal structure of p97 with AMPPNP bound to D2 at 3.5 Å resolution (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005), the D2 -helical sub-domain is largely disordered. N and D1 domains are arranged in the same orientation as the original ND1 structure (Zhang et al., 2000) with the ADP bound D1 domains forming inter-protomer contacts and the N domains in the same plane on the periphery. In all available crystal structures to date, there are no conformational

changes visible as dramatic as those seen in the cryo-EM reconstructions and SAXS data (Fig. 2). Discrepancies between these studies could have arisen for various reasons: insuYcient binding of AMPPNP (diVerent concentrations used), partial hydrolysis (diVerent incubation times), diVerences in buVer conditions (low pH and high salt are known to change the hydrolysis properties, this is relevant for the crystal structures), diVerences in assignment of domains in EM-reconstructions, heterogeneous samples and limitations of methods could all blur the overall picture. Another explanation could be that N domains remain Xexible in this state, at least without the restricting eVect of adaptor binding and explaining why so many diVerent conformations have been observed. However, their clear visibility in one cryo-EM reconstruction (Beuron et al., 2003) and indications from the SAXS data (Davies et al., 2005) suggest a certain degree of `rigidity'. 6.2. The transition state To probe further into an enzyme's catalytic mechanism, structures are often studied `trapped' with a reaction intermediate analogue or transition state using a transition state analogue (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Rappas et al., 2005; Rouiller et al., 2002). For ATPases, the

transition state is usually mimicked by using ADP-AlF3 as it forms a trigonal bipyramidal geometry within the active site that is reminiscent of the expected penta-coordinated transition state of the hydrolysis reaction; although ADPBeF3¡ can also be used and is thought to bind in a tetrahedral fashion more closely resembling the Michaelis complex (Xu et al., 1997). Structures for p97 in this trapped form have been determined by EM, X-ray crystallography, and SAXS (Fig. 2) and in all of these studies it is assumed/determined that ADP is present in the D1 ring and ADP-AlF3 is present in the D2 ring, albeit to varying occupancies (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005). The Wrst glimpse of p97 in the transition state came from cryo-EM at a resolution of 24 Å (Rouiller et al., 2002). This structure was unique when compared with the other EM structures of p97 from the same study in diVerent nucleotide states as additional density was clearly seen for the N domains on the periphery of and coplanar with the D1 ring. The appearance of the N domains in this state suggests that they are more ordered and/or rigid. In comparison with the AMPPNP state, in the same study, the height of p97 in the trapped conformation is slightly smaller and the side protrusions, assumed to be part of the D2 domain (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003), are rotated clockwise by 3° and the D2 ring is reported to have rotated counter-clockwise by 8°. The central pore in the ADP-AlF3 state is `open' in the D1 ring and `closed' in the D2 ring. As it was assumed that the D1 ring would be fully occupied by ADP and the D2 ring would be fully occupied by ADP-AlF3, the hexamer would be perfectly symmetrical and 6-fold averaging was performed in order to obtain this reconstruction. The Wrst crystal structure to be published of full-length p97 was solved in this trapped form to 4.7 Å resolution (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003). The crystallisation conditions were of low ionic strength and neutral pH, similar to physiological conditions. Electron density was visible for the N domains, D1 domains and D2 domains although some stretches of the D2 and C-terminal extension were not included in this model. As in the other structures (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Dreveny et al., 2004a; Huyton et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2000) the N domains are coplanar with the D1 ring. The D2 domains are stacked directly below (viewing from ND1) the D1 hexamer in a translation with only small rotations. The crystal lattice does contain the physiological hexamer but the asymmetric unit only contains three monomers that generate the hexamer via the crystallographic 2-fold. This initial crystal structure reported six ADP molecules in the D1 ring and six ADP-AlF3 molecules in the D2 ring. A zinc ion was also observed in the central pore of this structure, although the stability and functional relevance of this remains unclear. Subsequently, the same group reprocessed the same data and included higher resolution data to 4.4 Å (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005). Interestingly, the improvement of resolution showed that the occupancy of nucleotide in the D2 domains was not equal and the monomers within the D2 ring could exist in diVerent nucleotide states. Of the three

protomers in the asymmetric unit only one `(C)' had unambiguous density for ADP-AlF3, while `(B)' had full occupancy for the ADP moiety and partial occupancy for AlF3 and `(A)' had full occupancy for the ADP moiety only. The occupancy of the ADP molecules in the D1 ring and the zinc ion in the central pore remained unchanged in this new interpretation. p97 in the presence of ADP-AlF3 has been studied by SAXS at a resolution of 8.6 Å (Davies et al., 2005). The N domains are viewed coplanar with D1 at the periphery of the hexamer consistent with the EM reconstruction and crystal structures. Also consistent with the EM reconstruction the pore in the D1 ring appears to be open, whereas in the crystal structure the pore was found occluded by a zinc ion. This points to an interpretation where a zinc ion is not always present in the D1 pore, although the diVerent resolutions of the studies make a Wnal conclusion impossible. In contrast the D2 pore is viewed wider in the SAXS model and closed in the EM reconstruction. The SAXS model of the ADP-AlF3 agrees well with the crystal structure; the Rg (Radius of gyration) and Dmax (largest distance between two atoms) of the SAXS data and those calculated from the crystal structure are 55.4 Å/54.4 Å (Rg) and 176 Å/166 Å (Dmax) respectively, the 10 Å diVerence in the Dmax is probably due to the crystal structure not being complete. The N domains are coplanar with the D1 ring and the pore in the D2 ring is more Xared. The EM and SAXS studies initially showed 6-fold symmetry of D2. Thus, 6-fold averaging was applied to obtain the EM reconstruction (Rouiller et al., 2002) and was imposed in the modelling of SAXS data (Davies et al., 2005). In light of Wnding the unequal occupancy of ADPAlF3 in the crystal structure it is of concern that useful information may have been lost in the 6-fold averaging of data by EM and SAXS methods. It is, therefore, important to conWrm the unequal occupancy either biochemically or in diVerent crystal forms. In conclusion, in the transition state all three structural techniques agree that the N domains are on the periphery of and coplanar with the D1 ring. The SAXS data agree very well with the crystal structure, the EM reconstruction diVers from the SAXS and the crystal structures as the pore in D2 is more closed. 6.3. The ADP state The ADP state refers to p97 which has ADP bound in D1 as well as in the D2 ring. It represents the enzyme bound to the product of the reaction hence the end state of the hydrolysis reaction, prior to product release. This state is more amenable to experiments than the transition state or the substrate analogue bound state, since ADP when bound to the protein does not undergo a chemical reaction, and so can be expected to result in a more homogenous population of molecules. It is therefore not surprising that structures of the ADP state are relatively consistent independent of the method used. In cryo-EM reconstructions, the overall shape is quite similar extending to one open and one closed pore of

the two rings, respectively (Beuron et al., 2003; Rouiller et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2000). There is some conXict however in the assignment of domains. Beuron and co-workers (Beuron et al., 2003) have assigned protrusions that extend from one of the rings as N domains after labelling them with antibodies in negative stain (this was done in the presence of AMPPNP and compared with the ADP reconstruction). The volume attributed to these densities is smaller than expected for N domains, which was interpreted as Xexibility and the D1 pore was reported to be open and the D2 pore to be closed. Rouiller et al. (2002) assigned the side protrusions to be the C-terminal extensions with no accountable densities for N domains based on a comparison with a D1­D2 cryoEM reconstruction lacking the N domains and Wtting of the D1 ring structure into this density. Fitting of the `transition state' crystal structure into this map suggested that the protrusions could be part of the D2 domain (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003). The D1 pore in the cryo-EM reconstructions is closed and the D2 pore open (Rouiller et al., 2002). The SAXS model of the ADP state at 8.6 Å resolution observes N domains coplanar with the D1 ring and the D1 pore more open than the D2 pore. From these data, the D2 ring seems to open up upon product formation/release. In the crystal structures, there seems to be a slightly larger conformational change upon release of the product, i.e., `ADP­APO state' transition compared to other states. In conclusion, the crystal structure (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005), SAXS model (Davies et al., 2005), and one of the EM reconstructions (Beuron et al., 2003) of the ADP state are mostly consistent in their positioning of N domains and the SAXS model and one of the EM reconstructions also agree on a narrow D2 central pore (Beuron et al., 2003). 6.4. The APO state The simplest and most homogeneous nucleotide state to view p97 is probably the APO state, where no extra nucleotide has been added to the p97 sample. In this state, we assume the D1 ring to be occupied with ADP and the D2 ring to be empty. This state represents the last stage of the ATP hydrolysis cycle where the products have been released and the sites are available for further rounds of nucleotide binding. However, samples for the cryo-EM reconstruction (Rouiller et al., 2002) and those used for the SAXS experiments were treated with apyrase which completely removes nucleotide as shown by Davies et al. (2005) and may therefore not be physiological. Rouiller et al. (2000) were the Wrst to view p97 in the APO state by EM (20­25 Å) and they reported that the monomers were arranged around a »25 Å diameter hole extending outwards to a radius of »85 Å. Adjacent to the central pore, two regions of low density per protomer were observed, six of these pointing inwards, and six pointing outwards in an asymmetric fashion, suggesting a `weak' handedness of the hexamer. From a model constructed from the homologous NSF D2 structure they suggested that the D1 and D2 stacked rings were rotated against each

other but were not more than 20° out of register. Later, the same group (Rouiller et al., 2002) compared the 3D EM reconstructions of the APO state with the AMPPNP state at 22 Å resolution, the diameter of the APO state was »10 Å larger in both rings. The top ring was almost the same for both the APO and the AMPPNP state but there was a conformational change in the bottom ring which became more compact and less scalloped. Side protrusions were visible in these structures and are probably parts of the D2 domains (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003); in comparison to the AMPPNP reconstruction the side protrusions in the APO form are rotated »30 counter-clockwise and the D2 ring is rotated »8° counter-clockwise. The crystal structure at 3.6 Å resolution of p97 in the APO state has one protomer per asymmetric unit and crystallised in a hexagonal space group and so physiological hexamers were generated via the 6-fold crystallographic symmetry (Huyton et al., 2003). The ND1 domains were as reported previously (Zhang et al., 2000) and the D2 domains were situated directly below the D1 ring in a direct translation and small rotation. AMPPNP/2 -Br-AMPPNP had been added to the p97 sample prior to crystallisation but was not visualised in the D2 domains; this is consistent with the unstable behaviour of AMPPNP at acidic pHs (Dawson et al., 1986). Furthermore, the crystals were grown in high phosphate salt and acidic pH, conditions that do not represent p97's physiological environment. The D2 domains were not as well deWned as the ND1 domains possibly due to the poor crystal packing and/or the inherent Xexibility of these domains in the absence of nucleotide. The -helical subdomain was the least visible of the domains and the C-terminal extension was not interpretable at all. Due to the poor density, the D2 domain was modelled as a poly-alanine chain (Huyton et al., 2003). Interestingly, comparing the APO crystal structure with the AMPPNP crystal structure solved subsequently (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005), the crystals were grown in similar conditions and had the same crystal packing, only the latter did show AMPPNP in the D2 active sites. In both the APO and the AMPPNP states, the D2 domains were less visible than in the ADP-AlF3 and ADP states (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005). Viewed by SAXS p97 in the APO state, at 8.6 Å resolution, is (Davies et al., 2005) analogous with the crystal structure; the N domains are coplanar with the D1 ring; the D2 ring base is more Xared. The pores of the D1 and D2 rings are both open, with the D2 pore being more open (three times that of the D1 pore) reXecting a looser packing of the D2 domains, possibly explaining the mobile D2 domains in the crystal structure. Overall the APO state of p97 seems to exhibit the most Xexibility when investigated by SAXS, which is consistent with the other available data. 7. Conformational changes during the ATPase cycle The Wrst high-resolution structure of the p97 ND1 fragment, where the connectivity between the N and the D1 domains was observed in a physiological hexamer,

prompted one of the Wrst models to be proposed for conformational changes during the ATPase cycle (Zhang et al., 2000). In the same journal issue, Rouiller et al. (2000) also suggested conformational changes for p97 between the APO and `ATP' states and the `ATP' and ADP states using EM. They proposed that it was nucleotide binding and not hydrolysis that drove the major conformational change. Since then many diVerent models have been proposed. Initially it was assumed that both D1 and D2 were catalytically active, giving rise to model 1 (Fig. 3A). Analysis of ATPase activity (Ye et al., 2003) conWrmed this, leading to the proposal of model 2 (Fig. 3B). However, when Song and co-workers carried out a similar analysis of ATPase activity of p97 mutants, they came to a diVerent conclusion (see Section 3) (Song et al., 2003) and suggested that D1 is relatively inactive and important for maintaining the hexameric structure of p97 (analogous to D2 of NSF), while D2 contributes the bulk of ATPase activity. All subsequently proposed models are inXuenced by these studies, which are also supported by the crystal structures of p97 with diVerent nucleotides bound to D2 but ADP bound invariantly to

D1 (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005). The proposed models based on both biochemical and structural data are summarised in the following section and schematically shown in Fig. 3. 7.1. The ratchet model The ratchet model was the Wrst model for the mechanism of action of p97 and was proposed when the ND1 structure was published (Zhang et al., 2000) (Fig. 3A). It was based upon a comparison of p97 D1 domain bound to ADP and NSF D2 domain bound to AMPPNP (Lenzen et al., 1998). Superposition of the two structures showed a small rotation suggesting that this movement may occur upon ATP hydrolysis. Comparison with EM structures led to the proposal that the two rings may be able to exist in diVerent nucleotide states. An extension of this suggested that the two domains' activities are interconnected in a negatively cooperative manner such that ATP hydrolysis (accompanied by rotational motion) in one domain causes ADP release in the opposing domain and vice versa. While this

For simplicity the hexameric rings of D1 (orange) and D2 (cyan) are shown as single cylinders and only two of the six N domains (pink) are represented. In some models side protrusions, predicted to be part of the D2 domain (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003), are also observed these are represented as purple triangles.

was a reasonable interpretation of the data available at the time, it has since become clear that this is a comparison between two domains that do not exhibit the main ATPase activity (p97 D1 and NSF D2) and therefore may not undergo the most dramatic conformational changes during the ATPase cycle. NSF D2 does not seem to undergo hydrolysis at all (Matveeva et al., 1997). Nevertheless, the model could still be valid and cannot be ruled out at present. 7.2. The communication between the two rings model Biochemical analysis of ATPase activity and quasi-equilibrium nucleotide binding of Walker A and B mutants led to the suggestion of a mechanism (Fig. 3B) similar to the ratchet model (Ye et al., 2003). Ye and co-workers found that p97 was inactive when D1 or D2 contained a Walker A mutation (binding deWcient), suggesting that activity in each ring is dependent on nucleotide binding in the opposing ring. ATP hydrolysis in D1 required nucleotide binding/ hydrolysis in D2 whereas hydrolysis in D2 did not require hydrolysis in D1, only nucleotide binding. It must be noted that this pattern of activity in mutants is controversial as a similar assay was carried out with diVerent Wndings (Song et al., 2003). 7.3. The molecular latch model A comparison of the ADP-AlF3 crystal structure with the cryo-EM reconstruction in the ADP state led to the `molecular latch' model (Fig. 3C) of how the D2 domain of p97 could exert force upon its substrates bound to the N domain (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003; Rouiller et al., 2002). Strikingly, the EM reconstructions in diVerent nucleotide states showed no N domain density except in the presence of ADP-AlF3. This led to the proposition that the N domains are Xexible until locked in position during the transition state of the hydrolysis reaction in D2. The process of trapping the substrate via the locked N domain could exert the necessary force for protein dislocation. The D1 -helical sub-domain was identiWed as the potential latch to do this as it forms strong contacts with the N domain and could pull it back against the D1 domain. It is also connected to the D1­D2 linker which has been proposed to transmit information about changes in the nucleotide as it passes close to the D2 nucleotide binding pocket (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003). Throughout this, the D1 / domain remains stationary and as a consequence is dubbed the `fulcrum of motion.' The p97 crystal structure with no nucleotide bound to D2 (Huyton et al., 2003) agrees that the D1 / sub-domain could act to maintain the hexamer whilst the D1 -helical domain could undergo conformational change. However, superposition of the two structures shows they are remarkably similar and diVer only in the relative position of the D2 domain (r.m.s.d. still within the resolution of the structures). This is incompatible with the molecular latch theory

as the D1 -helical sub-domain should be positioned diVerently when D2 is empty. On the other hand, normal mode analysis as well as SAXS and cryo-EM reconstructions of the full-length p97 molecule suggest that the N domains can adopt diVerent conformations or are Xexible (Beuron et al., 2003; Davies et al., 2005; Rouiller et al., 2000, 2002), indicating that the position may be inXuenced by crystal packing constraints in both structures. 7.4. The pre-activated (APO and `ATP')--activated state (`ATP8' and ADP) processive model This model is based on the crystal structures in diVerent nucleotide states (Fig. 3D). The diVerences between the four crystal structures in diVerent nucleotide states are small (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Huyton et al., 2003). Unlike the predictions of the molecular latch model, a change between ADP and APO state and between AMPPNP and ADP-AlF3 (rather than between ADP-AlF3 and ADP as predicted) has been observed. These changes occur in the domains suspected earlier; N and D1 -helical subdomains exhibit small rotations and D1­D2 linkers and D2 -helical sub-domains exhibit order­disorder transitions. The ADP-AlF3 structure of p97 most closely resembles the ADP state structure, `conformation one/activated' (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005) and is more diVerent to the APO (Huyton et al., 2003) and `ATP' (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005) states, `conformation two/pre-activated'. The diVerences observed between the two conformations are small, with on average rigid body shifts of 3 Å. The ADP-AlF3 structure exhibits a novel small rotation of the D2 / sub-domain that is not observed in any of the other crystal structures. The major diVerence between the conformations appears to be the rigidity of the D2 -helical sub-domains; in conformation one, the D2 -helical sub-domains are clearly visible and therefore assumed to be ordered. In conformation two, however, the D2 -helical sub-domains are less visible in the electron density map and are therefore assumed to be Xexible or disordered. All D2 helical sub-domains appear ordered in the ADP-AlF3 structure despite the diVerent nucleotide occupancy around the ring. The close resemblance of the ADP-AlF3 and ADP states and the APO and `ATP' states can be explained from many viewpoints. First, as previously described (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2005) these states could represent the physiological events during the ATPase cycle, alternating between a `pre-activated' state and an `activated' state with the main conformational change occurring in the order­disorder transition of the D2 -helical sub-domains. While this is a good explanation and highly plausible, other aspects have to be considered. The nucleotide occupancy between the ADP-AlF3 and ADP states only fully diVers in one domain of two protomers per hexamer, in other protomers there is partial or no occupancy for the AlF3 moiety in D2 and all D1s have ADP bound. Hence, the addition of two to three AlF3 moieties per 12 nucleotide binding hexamer is the only

22

diVerence between these structures. Comparing the APO and the `ATP' forms, six AMPPNP molecules are visualised in the D2 ring as opposed to no nucleotide in the APO form. The D1 ring is ubiquitously fully occupied by ADP, however the addition of six AMPPNP molecules in the D2 ring does not appear to cause any signiWcant conformational changes. Comparing the crystallisation conditions it is evident that the ADP-AlF3 and ADP crystals were grown from the same condition (0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05 M NH4F, 4­5% PEG 3350, and 0­0.005 M DTT) and the APO and AMPPNP crystals were grown from very similar conditions (0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 1.0­1.4 M ammonium phosphate, 1­5% PEG 400, 0.002 M -ME; 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 0.75 M sodium phosphate, and 0.05 M ammonium Xuoride, 6% PEG400). It is possible that p97 in the more physiological environment of low ionic strength and neutral pH (ADP-AlF3 and ADP states) could behave diVerently than in the less physiological environment of high salt and acidic pH (APO and `ATP' states). Finally, comparing the crystal forms it is noticeable that the ADPAlF3 and ADP crystals are the same (space group I222; ADP-AlF3 unit cell: a D 162.6 Å, b D 177.9 Å, c D 320.9 Å; ADP unit cell: a D 163.9 Å, b D 178.4 Å, c D 320.0 Å). Comparing the APO and `ATP' crystals, these too are of an analogous form and exhibit identical crystal packing (APO: space group P622, unit cell: a D b D 145.3 Å, c D 165.5 Å; ATP: space group P3, unit cell: a D b D 144.9 Å, c D 164.4 Å). It is diYcult to conclude that the diVerences observed between the two diVerent crystal forms (namely the order­ disorder of the D2 -helical sub-domain) are solely due to the nucleotide state and are not aVected in part by the buVer conditions and/or the crystal packing. 7.5. The SAXS data derived model Davies et al. (2005) proposed that the nucleotide binding state of p97 predominantly inXuences the position of the N domains and the size of the hexamer pore (Fig. 3E). When ATP binds to p97 the N domains go down below the plane of D1 (this is the only report of N domains going down; all other reports view N domains either in the D1 plane, above the D1 ring or are not viewed at all), the D2 ring rotates »20° clockwise and the pore reduces its diameter by half, as nucleotide is hydrolysed the N domains return to their coplanar arrangement and the D2 pore widens to a ratio of D1:D2 pore of 1:7 and the D2 rotates another »10° clockwise. When the phosphate is released, D2 rotates back, counter-clockwise, by 15° and the D2s move inwards closing the D2 pore to the size of that in the `ATP' state. Side protrusions are also seen by SAXS midway down the molecule. The D1 pore remains relatively constant in all nucleotide states, with a small expansion in the no nucleotide state. 8. Adaptor and substrate binding The majority of structural studies on p97 have been conducted on p97 alone, but it is clear that p97 is very often in

complex with one or more adaptor proteins that direct energy from ATP binding and/or hydrolysis to p97's numerous functions. Solution studies of p97 all reveal mobile N domains which are the major adaptor binding regions of p97 (the only currently known exceptions are Ufd2 (Richly et al., 2005) and Ufd3 (Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006) which bind to N-p97). In the crystal structures the N domains all adopt a position coplanar with the D1 ring (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Dreveny et al., 2004a; Huyton et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2000) suggesting that this must represent one possible physiological conformation. As p97 interacts with various adaptor proteins in mediating its multiple functions, determining p97-adaptor interactions is crucial for understanding its mechanism of function. Studies to date have produced structures for p97 in complex with its adaptor protein p47 and these have led to proposals into how the mechanical force generated by p97 is transmitted to adaptor proteins to work on substrates. p97­p47 was Wrst viewed by EM in 2D (Rouiller et al., 2000) with six p47 molecules located on the periphery of a p97 hexamer. It was also reported that in nucleotide free and ADP states p47 bound less rigidly to p97, but when ATP bound p47 became more rigidly attached and splayed at the periphery of the p97 hexamer. It was suggested that this transition from Xexible to rigid provides the force to mediate function (Rouiller et al., 2000). This together with the crystal structure (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003) and 3D cryo-EM reconstructions (Rouiller et al., 2002) was the basis for the molecular latch model (see Section 7.3). Later, the structure of p97 ND1 domains in complex with a fragment of p47 was solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.9 Å (Dreveny et al., 2004a) and this supported the notion that six p47 molecules could bind at the p97 hexamer periphery. However, the observation of six p47 molecules binding to the p97 hexamer is in contrast to biochemical studies in which a p47 trimer was shown to bind to the p97 hexamer (Kondo et al., 1997). Although the ND1-p47 (UBX) structure does provide invaluable atomic resolution detail of how p47 and indeed other UBX domains can bind to p97, neither component in the ND1-p47 (UBX) structure is fulllength and therefore may not represent the physiological complex. Recent 3D cryo-EM reconstructions of the p97­ p47 complex (Beuron et al., in press) are consistent with biochemical studies that p47 can form a trimer in solution (Kondo et al., 1997; Yuan et al., 2004) and bind to a p97 hexamer as a trimer (Kondo et al., 1997). In the future, it will be important to determine the structures of the p97-adaptor complexes to fully understand how p97 functions as an ATPase and how conformational changes are transmitted to substrates. It is currently unclear how p97 interacts with substrates, whether binding always occurs via adaptors or directly as seen for the yeast orthologue Cdc48 (Thoms, 2002) and for p97 ERAD substrates (Ye et al., 2003) or if p97 interacts with all substrates in the same fashion? p97 has a pore in the centre, which when compared with the classic chaperones, e.g., GroEL, may be an obvious choice for

23

substrate binding/threading. The D1 pore however has been reported to be occupied by a zinc ion in two of the four crystal structures, which is intriguing and would block (possibly only transiently) a direct route from the N domain bound adaptors into the central pore via the shortest route. The D2 pore, however, is not `blocked' by any ion and is arguably the ring that seems to conformationally Xuctuate the most during the ATPase cycle. It may be possible therefore that substrates may bind in the D2 pore/cavity. For the related archeal protein VAT there is evidence for a pore threading mechanism via predominantly D1 (Gerega et al., 2005). The other alternative is that substrates interact with the outside of the p97 hexameric barrel, indeed the atomic structure of the C-terminal extension of p97 is not fully known and this could provide a possible interaction site as well as the N domains. 9. p97 Relatives 9.1. VAT The archeal VAT is a p97 homologue (44% sequence identity) and exerts foldase and unfoldase activity dependent upon the concentration of ATP and Mg2+ present, probably involving diVerent conformational states (Golbik et al., 1999). Pore residues in especially D1 but also D2 are important for substrate binding and essential for unfolding activity consistent with a threading mechanism through the pore (Gerega et al., 2005). ATPase activity of VAT seems to involve inter-domain cooperativity and both D1 and D2 are active (Gerega et al., 2005). In contrast to p97 however, no adaptor proteins are known to interact with VAT. The N domain of VAT alone was reported to promote the refolding of a test substrate (Golbik et al., 1999). Interestingly, a N VAT mutant displayed higher ATPase activity and was more eYcient in unfolding a native globular protein than the full-length protein (Gerega et al., 2005). The N domains are clearly visible in a 3D cryo-EM reconstruction in the absence of nucleotide (Rockel et al., 2002) (Fig. 2). The density shape projecting out of the plane of the main body does not Wt any of the N domain crystal structures very well. It was suggested that the N domains could adopt a diVerent conformation in respect to the D1 ring compared to p97 (Rockel et al., 2002). The pore sizes in VAT D1 and D2 are very similar, but appear larger than in p97, which could facilitate a pore threading mechanism and could reXect diVerences in mechanism between the two homologues. In rotary shadowing maps (Rockel et al., 2000) and electron tomography the N domains of VAT can also be located at the periphery of the molecule (Rockel et al., 1999). The nucleotide state was not assessed for the samples used in these experiments, but the storage buVer contained ATP. The p97 SAXS reconstruction in the APO state (Davies et al., 2005) resembles the VAT cryo-EM structure in terms of overall shape. The p97 APO 3D cryoEM reconstruction diVers, however, in terms of central

spikes and visibility of N domains (Rouiller et al., 2002). To date no data exist for conformational changes in VAT during the ATPase cycle. 9.2. Cdc48 Yeast Cdc48 and p97 share 65% sequence identity over the full-length of their sequences and Cdc48 is considered to be the yeast orthologue of p97. Despite this appreciable homology, porcine VCP cannot functionally complement Cdc48 mutants (Feiler et al., 1995; Madeo et al., 1998). Cdc48 shows classical chaperone-like functions as it is capable of interacting with denatured proteins. Interestingly, interaction with denatured substrates (preventing aggregation) seems to be independent of ATPase activity (Thoms, 2002). In Cdc48, positive cooperativity was detected from Hill plots (Frohlich et al., 1995), with a Hill coeYcient of 2.5. Product inhibition by ADP has also been observed (Frohlich et al., 1995). How the ATPase cycle correlates with conformational changes in Cdc48 has not yet been investigated but given the high sequence identity the structure and mechanism are generally assumed to be very similar to p97's mode of action. 9.3. NSF/SEC18 p97 and NSF share signiWcant sequence homology (»20% of sequence identity), but nevertheless many diVerences exist (Brunger and DeLaBarre, 2003). NSF is involved in membrane fusion but, in contrast to p97, has never been implicated in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation events (Whiteheart and Matveeva, 2004). NSF lacks a C-terminal extension and phosphorylation sites (Brunger and DeLaBarre, 2003) and main adaptor binding sites are likely to diVer between the two ATPases (Dreveny et al., 2004a). There is also a discrepancy as to which AAA cassette exerts the main ATPase activity. In contrast to p97, in NSF it is the D1 domain that harbours the main ATPase activity and the D2 domain is responsible for hexamerisation, which is dependent on the presence of nucleotide (Hanson et al., 1997). The crystal structure of the NSF hexamerisation domain (Lenzen et al., 1998) shows that the ring has a wider opening than the p97 D1 ring and there is a slight rotation. This comparison led to the hypothesis that ATP binding in the ATPase domains would result in widening of the pore and a rotational movement (Zhang et al., 2000) as the basis for the ratchet model (see Section 7.1). Quick-freeze/deep-etch electron microscopy of NSF revealed that the N domains are visible in the `ATP' state, represented by ATP- -S, whereas they were not clearly discernable in the ADP state. ATP binding in D1 induces a conformational change that makes the protein competent for -SNAP­SNARE binding (Hanson et al., 1997). In negative stain, the N domains of the hydrolysis mutant NSF E329Q are weakly visible and mostly located slightly above the D1 plane (Furst et al., 2003). The 3D cryo-EM reconstruction of the 20S complex, consisting of mutant

NSF, -SNAP and the non-directly membrane associated parts of the neuronal SNARE complex (SNAP-25, syntaxin and synaptobrevin), suggests that the arrangement of D1 and D2 could be opposite to the head-to-tail packing seen for p97 (Furst et al., 2003). As the main ATPase activity resides within the D1 domain, of unknown structure, conformational change to N domains in NSF only needs to be transmitted via the N­D1 linker. The D2 domain seems to be relatively inert, since in the crystal structure of this domain ATP was bound even after 14 days, the time it took for the crystals to grow in low salt at pH 6.1 (Yu et al., 1998). In a diVerent NSF D2 crystal structure, AMPPNP was located in the active site (Lenzen et al., 1998), which had been included in the crystallisation solution. The proposed diVerent D1­D2 arrangement (tail-to-tail) in NSF (Furst et al., 2003) makes a comparison with p97 and indeed other AAA+ proteins such as ClpA (Guo et al., 2002) and ClpB (Lee et al., 2003), whose crystal structures also reveal a head-to-tail packing, diYcult. 10. Methods critique The biophysical techniques used to study protein structure each have their speciWc advantages and limitations, we brieXy summarise these in the following section. X-ray crystallography is an ideal method to study protein structures in many ways. It is amenable to proteins of all sizes and results in high-resolution structures (typically 1.0­3.5 Å). One of the disadvantages of crystallography, apart from the diYculty of producing diVracting crystals, is the relatively static snapshot of a protein obtained. Protein molecules are by nature Xexible, Xuid systems that rely on their surroundings and other interacting proteins for their survival and functioning. To `trap' a protein in a highly concentrated, vast array, constrained by lattice contacts and unnatural hydrogen bonding, ionic and electrostatic interactions with its neighbour is far from physiological, but it is necessary in order to determine atomic resolution details of such macromolecules. When viewing a crystal structure it is always an advantage to look at the lattice environment and not just the asymmetric unit or biologically relevant unit of the molecule. The quality of a crystal structure may easily be assessed by the goodness of Wt of model with data (free R factor), quality of electron density, resolution of structure, temperature factor values, and geometry of the model. The resolution of the model obtained is determined by the diVraction limits of the crystal, this is largely dependent on the internal order of the crystal. In general, the higher the resolution the more conWdence one has in the structural details including side chain positions and non-covalent interactions. Single particle EM has immediate advantages over crystallography in that it does not require protein crystals but the sample needs to be homogeneous. The protein samples can be observed immediately and they are free in solution until the point of Wxation on the grid or freezing of the sample, which are instantaneous. Samples can be either visual-

ised dried after negative staining or observed in a native frozen-hydrated state (cryo-EM). Cryo-EM is a fantastic tool to look at the structure and conformational changes of large macromolecular assemblies upon substrate or cofactor binding as the samples can be prepared under near physiological conditions to ensure proper interactions. Instant visualisation of the sample gives a good indication of whether or not the sample is worth pursuing and whether a 3D reconstruction can be achieved. Reconstructions can be made either ab initio or using a reference model. Furthermore, it is possible to distinguish between components in large assemblies by using exogenous labelling and/or additional subtractive/additive types of experiments. EM does however have some drawbacks, the resolution of the single particle cryo-EM reconstructions are not atomic (typically 10­30 Å), but when used in conjunction with high-resolution structures of diVerent domains or sub-domains, a `higher resolution' model can be built up. Other disadvantages of EM are that smaller macromolecules (<100 kDa) may not be visualised very easily by this method. Furthermore, the quality of 3D reconstructions can be aVected if the molecule has preferred orientations thus restricting the distribution of views. Starting models can also inXuence the Wnal reconstruction introducing model bias in some cases. For these reasons some features in the 3D reconstructions might appear diVerent when studied using diVerent approaches. Symmetrisation is often applied to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio but can also lead to errors in the Wnal reconstructions if not well established beforehand. The quality and resolution of the maps obtained is usually assessed by the Fourier Shell Correlation criterion (recently discussed in van Heel and Schatz, 2005). The data are split in half and two independent three dimensional (3D) reconstructions are calculated. The consistency of the two independent 3D reconstructions is compared as a function of the spatial frequency. SAXS diVers from X-ray crystallography in that aqueous solutions rather than crystals are used, and only scattering at small angles (within 2°) are of interest. Analysis of the scattered X-rays within this range elucidates structural details around the 10­1000 Å range. This technique has been in use for many years, however, its application to the detailed study of large molecular complexes has only recently become worthwhile. This advance is owed largely to the availability of synchrotron radiation sources and the application of a simulated annealing method in which the biological molecule is modelled by a large number of tightly packed dummy atoms, these are moved around in order to Wnd a conWguration that best Wts the data and thus produce a model of the structure (Svergum, 1999; Svergum and Koch, 2003). If available, high-resolution structures determined by either crystallography or NMR may be Wtted into the dummy atom structure. Essentially, for proteins in solution, SAXS can provide information regarding the Rg (radius of gyration), Dmax (maximum dimension of envelope), shape and at best a low-resolution model-independent molecular envelope structure. There is no equivalent

of the crystallographic free R factor for the SAXS technique as the data are rotationally averaged; in the future it may be possible to `Xag' an angle of the image plate before rotationally averaging. The resolution of a SAXS structure may be restrained to actual resolution of data collected, however it can be argued that constraints used at the modelling stage can give an eVective increase in resolution. The advantage of SAXS is that the proteins are still in solution, and averages of the whole population of molecules in solution are being obtained, however, radiation damage during data collection is likely to be greater than in EM. An advantage that EM has over SAXS is that molecules are visualised directly and because of this, markers can be used to determine the orientation of the molecule in question, in SAXS the orientation of a molecule may prove to be more diYcult to ascertain. SAXS is also a quick and powerful technique when used to determine the molecular weight of a protein complex and so may prove to be crucial in characterising p97-adaptor protein complexes. In conclusion, low-resolution studies (EM and SAXS) provide insight into general shape and size, from which domain organisation and broad conformational changes can be inferred. Medium to high-resolution studies (predominantly X-ray crystallography and NMR) are vital in implicating detailed arrangement and important interactions and mechanisms, although interpretation can still be subjective. At high resolutions, the conWdence in the model is often good and there are fewer discrepancies between diVerent methods/approaches. Additionally, since most structural studies only provide a snapshot of one protein conformation, the computational methods such as normal mode analysis (NMA) can be applied to characterise potential domain movements (Beuron et al., 2003; Huyton et al., 2003). One problem with all of these techniques is that in general an average of `identical motifs' is obtained. Owing to the naturally dynamic nature of proteins this `averaging' can be another drawback in the determination of physiologically accurate structures. Additionally, in cryo-EM the averaging of thousands of particles can produce erroneous areas owing to correlation of the noise signals, which have been shown to be indistinguishable from correlation resulting from actual signal (GrigorieV, 2000). Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses, in order to build up the most detailed picture possible for these macromolecules, these methods are best used in a combined approach to achieve enhanced accuracy and coverage. 11. Summary p97 is a complicated system to study, and we have only just scratched the surface in terms of elucidating its mechanism of action. The structure of p97 in diVerent nucleotide states has been solved by a variety of techniques at diVerent resolutions and many models have been proposed for p97's function. The diYculties encountered are illustrated by the two independent cryo-EM studies of p97 that have been carried

out to similar resolutions (Beuron et al., 2003; Rouiller et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2000). The Wrst diVerence between these two studies lies in the interpretation of the structures obtained, namely the assignment of the D1 and D2 rings to the determined electron density. In one study the ring with the larger diameter is assigned to be D1, based both on antibody labelling and the best Wtting of the ND1 crystal structure into the density (Beuron et al., 2003). In the other study, however the opposite assignment is proposed (Rouiller et al., 2002), based on comparison with N-p97 samples, it was suggested that the D1 ring has the smaller diameter. This inconsistency is an indication of how diYcult it can be to interpret low-resolution structural data and needs to be resolved in order to aid further interpretations. The discrepancy between these two cryo-EM studies also occurs in the attribution of density for the N domains. Either they are visible in the transition state only (Rouiller et al., 2002), where they were found to be coplanar with D1, or they can be located in both the `ATP' and ADP state structures, where in the `ATP' state the N domains appear slightly above the plane of D1 (Beuron et al., 2003). The opposite assignment of the D1 and D2 domains makes it diYcult to draw any Wrm conclusions from these observations and currently the reasons for the apparent diVerences between these studies are unclear. Comparison of the SAXS and cryo-EM data are complicated by the disagreement between the two cryo-EM studies. Importantly though a signiWcant diVerence between these two techniques is the resolution, the cryo-EM data are limited to a resolution of 18­24 Å while the SAXS structures include data to 8.6 Å. Interestingly, when the SAXS data were truncated to 20.9 Å, the molecular envelopes look diVerent from the ones obtained using higher resolution data, and notably bear a closer resemblance to the cryo-EM derived data (Davies et al., 2005). Causes for these discrepancies between the molecular envelopes obtained including diVerent resolution data are currently unknown. There is however a remarkable agreement between the structures put forward based on the higher resolution crystal structures and the SAXS reconstructions. In both the APO state and the transition state the crystal structures place the N domains coplanar with D1, the same arrangement is observed in the SAXS structures. The fact that the SAXS data show similar conformations indicates that these could be representative of the physiological conformations under these nucleotide conditions. Although the higher resolution crystal structures provide important insights into the changes that occur within the hexamer during the ATPase cycle, the need for a certain degree of structural rigidity in the crystal means that this technique is limited in viewing larger scale changes, such as the location of the Xexible N domains. This illustrates the importance of utilising a multi-disciplinary approach and increased value is placed on models that are supported by data from diVerent techniques. Crystallographic studies of p97 have been limited by poorly diVracting crystals showing pronounced anisotropic diVraction. p97 has been

26

crystallised in basically two diVerent crystal forms, one form with ADP-AlF3 or ADP in D2 and the other form either empty or with AMPPNP present in D2, all structures have ADP in D1 (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003, 2005; Huyton et al., 2003). It is not surprising that the nucleotide states in the same particular crystal form are similar as they are under the same stresses from the crystal lattice environment. Also the stability of the protein and nucleotide have to be taken into consideration, crystals often take days/ weeks to grow so a stable complex between p97 and its nucleotide has to be formed under the crystallisation conditions. Interpretation of nucleotide states and eVects of nucleotide on the p97 structure, especially at relatively low resolution, has to be done with care. Despite these inconsistencies, it has become clear from all of these studies that in p97 the N domains seem to undergo the most dramatic conformational changes. Interestingly, when N-p97 was studied by EM (Rouiller et al., 2002) no conformational changes were observed between the nucleotide states. This implies that although the N domains play no role in the ATPase activity of the enzyme, this component is crucial for the propagation and coordination of domain movements that lead to the many functions of p97. In addition, the D2 ring seems to be able to undergo more pronounced conformational changes than the D1 ring, consistent with showing the higher ATPase activity. This higher mobility of D2 is also consistent with limited proteolysis experiments (Wang et al., 2003b). The linkers between the N and D1 domains and the D1 and D2 domains have to play a critical role in transmitting conformational energy from the binding and hydrolysis of ATP to the N domains and in consequence to adaptor proteins to do physical work on substrates. Direct binding of substrates to p97 has only been poorly characterised. p97 binds to a plethora of adaptors and directs its energy to perform various functions in the cell. Whether or not p97 moves in the same fashion with or without adaptor is unknown and it is also unknown if diVerent adaptors constrain p97 in diVerent ways in order to harness the energy diVerently. It may even be true that diVerent adaptors and binding proteins restrict the possible motions in completely diVerent ways. To gain further understanding of these molecular machines we will have to study their respective protein­protein complexes. Another interesting question, which has not yet been addressed, is whether p97 is restricted in its motions by association with membrane. p97/Cdc48 has been reported to be `membrane associated' and interacts with a number of membrane proteins, for example VIMP (Ye et al., 2004), Ubx2 (Neuber et al., 2005; Schuberth and Buchberger, 2005; Schuberth et al., 2004), gp78 (Zhong et al., 2004), and HRD1 (Schulze et al., 2005), such an environment may physically constrain p97 in some fashion. Due to the lack of suYcient structural data it is currently unknown how close the family ties are between p97, VAT, and Cdc48 in terms of conformational changes during the ATPase cycle. The close type II AAA+ ATPase family

member NSF is proposed to have a diVerent packing arrangement of the D1 and D2 domains compared with p97 (tail-to-tail vs head-to-tail) (Furst et al., 2003) and this may be the case for other AAA+ proteins. Whether the arrangement of D1 and D2 domains is always linked to the site of main ATPase activity remains to be seen. It is clear that key to understanding the necessary mode of actions to perform a function are the locations of adaptor and/or substrate binding sites (e.g., Hsp104 and other members of Hsp100/Clp family also bind substrate via a C-terminal domain (Smith et al., 1999)) in relation to the main motor domain. In light of current data it seems unlikely that all AAA+ ATPases share a common mode of action. The possible motions include pore swelling and contraction in rings, individual rigid body movements of domains and/or sub-domains involving translation and/or rotation as well as order-disorder transitions, all of which have been proposed for p97. Only a combination of diVerent techniques will help us to understand complicated molecules like p97. We have however come a long way since the Wrst structural description of the molecule in 1990 (Peters et al., 1990), but many questions still remain unanswered. Through utilising multi-disciplinary approaches combined with careful interpretations, further progress will be made to elucidate the full active life story of p97.
