Abstract Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from the bacterium Oligotropha carboxidovorans catalyzes the oxidation of CO to CO2 at a unique [CuSMoO2] cluster. In the bacteria the cluster is assembled post-translational. The integration of S, and particularly of Cu, is rate limiting in vivo, which leads to CO dehydrogenase preparations containing the mature and fully functional enzyme along with forms of the enzyme deficient in one or both of these elements. The active sites of mature and immature forms of CO dehydrogenase were converted into a [MoO3] centre by treatment with potassium cyanide. We have established a method, which rescues 50% of the CO dehydrogenase activity by in vitro reconstitution of the active site through the supply of sulphide first and subsequently of Cu(I) under reducing conditions. Immature forms of CO dehydrogenase isolated from the bacterium, which were deficient in S and/or Cu at the active site, were similarly activated. X-ray crystallography and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that the [CuSMoO2] cluster was properly reconstructed. However, reconstituted CO dehydrogenase contains mature along with immature forms. The chemical reactions of the reconstitution of CO dehydrogenase are summarized in a model, which assumes resulphuration of the Mo-ion at both equatorial positions at a 1:1 molar ratio. One equatorial Mo≠S group reacts with Cu(I) in a productive fashion yielding a mature, functional [CuSMoO2] cluster. The other Mo≠ S group reacts with Cu(I), then Cu2S is released and an oxo group is introduced from water, yielding an inactive [MoO3] centre.

Introduction
Oligotropha carboxidovorans is a carboxidotrophic bacterium, which couples the oxidation of CO to CO2 (E0¢ = ¿520 mV) to the reduction of O2 to water (E0¢= + 810 mV) in the energy-conserving reaction 2 CO + O2 fi 2 CO2 [1]. The oxidation of CO is catalyzed by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CO + H2O fi CO2 + 2 e¿ + 2 H+), which is a structurally characterized heterohexameric 277-kDa Mo- and Cu-containing ironsulphur flavoprotein [2, 3]. CO dehydrogenase is composed of a 88.7 kDa molybdoprotein (L subunit), a 30.2 kDa flavoprotein (M subunit), and a 17.8 kDa ironsulphur protein (S subunit) in a (LMS)2 subunit composition [4]. The iron≠sulphur protein carries two [2Fe≠ 2S] clusters, which can be distinguished by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy [5]. The flavoprotein contains one molecule of non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The molybdoprotein accommodates a dinuclear heterometal [CuSMoO2] cluster bound to the organic cofactor molybdopterin≠cytosine dinucleotide (MCD, pyranopterin), which represents the active site of CO dehydrogenase. The cluster in different oxidation states or with the substrate-related bound inhibitor n-butylisocyanide has been intensively studied by chemical analyses, crystallography [2], X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and EPR spectroscopy [3]. The cluster is composed of Mo and Cu,

519

which are bridged by a l2 S atom. The Mo-site of the cluster is coordinated by the S7¢ and S8¢ of the enedithiolate of MCD, and the Cu-site interacts with the Sc of Cys388, which is part of the active site loop VAYRC388SFR [2, 3]. The Mo-ion in the oxidized cluster is in the +VI oxidation state, and upon incubation with CO or sodium dithionite is reduced to Mo(IV). The Cuion permanently remains in the +1 oxidation state. The ligands around Mo form a distorted square pyramidal geometry. The dithiolate group of MCD is positioned in the equatorial plane together with one S and one O group, which were modeled as a sulphido-group and a hydroxo∞ or oxo-group. The equatorial M-O distance of 1.87 A ∞ resolution) from obtained by crystallography (1.5 A frozen crystals of CO dehydrogenase has been interpreted ∞ as Mo≠OH [2] whereas the distance of 1.74 ± 0.02 A obtained by X-ray absorption spectroscopy from frozen solutions has been interpreted as Mo=O [3]. Because of ∞ the apical Mo≠O distance of 1.75 A (crystallography, ∞ resolution) or 1.74 ± 0.02 A (EXAFS) the apical ∞ 1.5 A ligand was modeled as an oxo-group. The bridging sulphur atom of the bimetallic centre and the Cu(I)-ion are cyanolysable since they react with potassium cyanide yielding thiocyanate (SCN¿) and copper cyanide (CuCN), respectively [2]. O. carboxidovorans harbors the low-copy-number 133,058 bp-circular DNA megaplasmid pHCG3 [6]. The plasmid carries the four gene clusters cox (14.54 kb, 12 genes), cbb (13.33 kb, 13 genes), hox (23.35 kb, 19 genes plus one ORF), and tra/trb (25.74 kb, 22 genes plus 2 ORFs), which assemble the functions required for the chemolithoautotrophic utilization of CO, CO2 or H2, or the conjugal transfer of the plasmid, respectively. The clusters cox, cbb, and hox form a 51.2 kb-chemolithoautotrophy module [6]. Insertional mutations in each of the genes coxDEF revealed CO dehydrogenases, which contained immature Mo clusters and, therefore, were impaired in their CO-oxidizing activity. These genes are functional in the post-translational maturation of CO dehydrogenase [1, 3, 6]. As has been discussed before, routine preparations of purified CO dehydrogenases contain varying fractions of mature and immature enzymes [2, 3]. The completion of the [CuSMoO2] cluster with Cu seems to be a major task in biosynthesis because the Cu-deficient precursors, which carry a [MoO2S] entity, represent the predominant immature fraction [3]. A minor immature fraction can be [MoO3] CO dehydrogenase. The main objectives of this study were to obtain the strongest chemical evidence for the cyanolysable sulphur, the Cu atom and the [CuSMoO2] cluster and to access the chemical reactivity of the cluster and its constituents with respect to post-translational maturation. For these purposes we have developed a procedure for the rapid, efficient, and reproducible chemical conversion of immature [MoO3] enzyme via the non-functional [MoO2S] enzyme to the structurally and functionally competent [CuSMoO2] CO dehydrogenase. In this work we have identified and characterized

naturally occurring precursors in the biosynthesis of CO dehydrogenase and demonstrated that the [MoO3] centre and the [MoO2S] centre show same EPR spectra. In future work the method will provide an invaluable tool for the characterization and generation of biosynthetic intermediates in mutant studies directed to the pathway of post-translational cluster assembly.

Materials and methods
Cultivation of bacteria and production of cell mass O. carboxidovorans strain OM5 (DSM 1227, ATCC 49405), [formerly Pseudomonas carboxydovorans OM5 [7, 8]] was employed throughout this study. The bacteria were mass-cultivated in 50-l fermentors (Braun Biostat U, Braun, Melsungen, Germany) under aerobic chemolithoautotrophic conditions with CO as a sole source of carbon and energy as previously described [7]. Usually about 235 g of cell wet weight were obtained from a 30-l culture grown to an OD436 of 8. Enzyme purification, activity assay and protein estimation CO dehydrogenase was isolated and purified from different batches of O. carboxidovorans as described [5]. The purified enzyme was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at ¿80∞C until use. The oxidation of CO mediated by CO dehydrogenase was followed spectrophotometrically with 1-phenyl-2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-2 H-tetrazolium chloride (INT)/1-methoxyphenazine methosulphate (MPMS) as artificial electron acceptors [9] employing an extinction coefficient (496) of 17.98 mM¿1 cm¿1. Specific enzyme activities are given in units per milligram (U mg¿1). One unit is defined as 1 lmol CO oxidized per min at 30∞C. The spectroscopic functionality of the forms of CO dehydrogenase employed was determined by comparing how much the iron≠sulphur centres and the FAD cofactor are reduced upon exposure of the enzyme to CO relative to the reduction with sodium dithionite. For that purpose the uv/visible spectra were recorded and analyzed as described previously [2]. Oxidation of xanthine by CO dehydrogenase was examined in a solution containing 0.5 mM xanthine, 0.1 M pyrophosphate-NaOH buffer (pH 8.5), and 0.3 mM Na-EDTA under air-saturated conditions, following the rate of uric acid formation at 295 nm at 25∞C [10] in a Uvikon 941 spectrophotometer (Kontron, Eching, Germany). Protein estimation followed conventional methods [11, 12]. Homogeneous enzyme concentrations were determined by using an extinction coefficient (450) of 72.0 mM¿1 cm¿1 [13]. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed published procedures [14]. For SDS-PAGE, 7.5% (mass/vol) acrylamide-stacking gels and 15% (mass/vol) acrylamide-running gels were used. For non-denaturing

520

PAGE, 7.5% (mass/vol) acrylamide-running gels were used. Protein staining was performed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Determination of sulphane sulphur, copper, and iron sulphane sulphur in the active site of CO dehydrogenase was determined by treatment of the enzyme with potassium cyanide yielding thiocyanate [3]. To a solution of CO dehydrogenase (5 mg ml¿1) in 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.2, 5 mM potassium cyanide was added and kept under pure nitrogen gas (Riesner Gase, Lichtenfels, Germany; grade 5.0, 99.999% N2), at room temperature for 10 h. Protein was separated from the small molecular weight fraction by ultrafiltration (VivaSpin II concentrator 30 kDa cutoff, Vivasciences, Stonehouse, Great Britain). In the ultrafiltrate thiocyanate was analyzed colorimetrically as the ferric complex [15]. Copper and iron in CO dehydrogenase were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (model 1100 B, Perkin® Elmer, Uberlingen, Germany). Analysis data are presented as means of three independent determinations. Standard deviations were 3.6% (Cu), 4.2% (Fe), and 7.2% (sulphane sulphur). Reconstitution of the catalytic centre of CO dehydrogenase with sodium sulphide and copper The sulphur and copper substituents in the catalytic centre of CO dehydrogenase were removed by treatment of the enzyme with potassium cyanide. Two milliliter of 50 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 8.2) containing 10 mg of CO dehydrogenase and 5 mM potassium cyanide were incubated in an 8 ml-serum stoppered glass vacutainer for 10 h under pure nitrogen gas at room temperature. The small molecular weight fraction was separated from CO dehydrogenase by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (PD10) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris≠HCl. The potassium cyanide-treated CO dehydrogenase was concentrated by ultrafiltration as detailed earlier. Resulphuration of potassium cyanide-treated CO dehydrogenase was achieved according to the following protocol: An 8 ml-serum stoppered glass vacutainer containing 9 mg of potassium cyanide-treated CO dehydrogenase in 1.5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) was made anoxic by repeated evacuation and gassing with pure nitrogen. Then anoxic stock solutions of 100 mM sodium sulphide (75 ll) or 100 mM sodium dithionite (80 ll) were injected consecutively with a syringe yielding final concentrations of 5 mM. Assays were incubated in the dark at 37∞C for 10 h or as indicated. Anoxic stock solutions of sodium sulphide or sodium dithionite were prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere in septum-sealed vacutainers by dissolving Na2S or Na2S2O4. Samples, removed with a syringe, were subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (PD10) under anoxic conditions yielding the resulphurated CO

dehydrogenase. For that purpose, the top of gel filtration columns was sealed with a septum and a needle was installed at the outlet. Buffer and samples were applied to the column through the septum and fractions were collected in septum-sealed vacutainers. Equilibration and elution were accomplished with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) made anoxic by flushing with nitrogen. The following protocol was elaborated for the effective reconstitution of resulphurated CO dehydrogenase with copper. A serum stoppered vacutainer was supplied with 8 mg of the above resulphurated CO dehydrogenase in 2 ml of anoxic Tris-HCl and 20 ll of anoxic 10 mM Cu(I)-thiourea complex in aqueous ascorbate. Assays were incubated at 37∞C for 2 to 4 h in the dark. The Cu≠thiourea complex was prepared by dissolving Cu(I)-chloride, thiourea, and sodium ascorbate (in a molar ratio of 1:3:1) in nitrogen flushed deionized water following published procedures [16≠18]. After the completion of Cu-transfer, remaining reactants were removed from the assay by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (PD10) employing air-saturated 50 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2) for equilibration and elution. Crystallization and structural analysis The different forms of CO dehydrogenase were crystallized with the hanging-drop technique adopting the conditions reported previously for native CO dehydrogenase [4]. Crystals were transformed on a free-mounting system, frozen in liquid N2 [2, 19] and measured at 100 K at the beam line ID14-2, ESRF (European Synchroton Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). Diffraction data were processed using XDS [20]. A crystal structure of potassium cyanide-treated CO dehydrogenase (PDB ID: 1N60), from which the water molecules and the anisotropic B-factor card has been removed was used as a starting model for rigid body minimization. Model building was done with MAIN [21], and the structure was refined using CNS [22]. To estimate the occupancies, 15 cycles of individual B-factor refinement starting from identical sets of coordinates have been carried out. The occupancies of atoms have been adjusted such that the B-factors deviated by less than 10% from the neighboring atoms. Table 1 gives the crystallographic data of the CO dehydrogenase preparation of batch II, which was treated with potassium cyanide and then reconstituted through the supply of sodium sulphide and Cu(I). Crystals were irradiated for 450 s at a wavelength of ∞ 0.933 A to collect a complete data set. PDB code: 1ZXI. The Ramachandran statistics are given as defined by PROCHECK [23]. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX 6-1 spectrometer

Results and discussion
Description of the forms of CO dehydrogenase employed The present study examines the in situ structural and functional reconstruction of the bimetallic active site of CO dehydrogenase. We have included mature forms of the enzyme (specific activity of 23 ± 0.4 U mg¿1 ; 94% spectroscopic functionality) as well as preparations containing immature precursors in the assembly of the [CuSMoO2] cluster, designated batch I (2.1 ± 0.3 U mg¿1, 8.9% spectroscopic functionality), batch II (0.8 ± 0.09 U mg¿1, 3.7% spectroscopic functionality), and batch III (2.2 ± 0.4 U mg¿1, 8.8% spectroscopic functionality). Native and denaturing PAGE indicated that the forms of CO dehydrogenase comprising batches I≠III revealed the same mobility and were fully assembled (Fig. 1a). Video densitometry showed the appropriate 1:1:1 molar ratio of the 88.7, 30.2, and 17.8-kDa subunits (Fig. 1b). Indistinguishable uv/vis absorption spectra of fully functional CO dehydrogenase and of batches I≠III indicated same contents of the FAD cofactor and iron≠sulphur centres. The fully functional CO dehydrogenase, batches I, II, and III contained 8.0 ± 0.6, 8.2 ± 0.2, 8.3 ± 0.2, or 7.9 ± 0.3 mol Fe per mol of enzyme, respectively, which agrees with complete integrity of the [2Fe≠2S] clusters. Fully functional CO dehydrogenase revealed 1.94 ± 0.04 mol Cu and 1.98 ± 0.08 mol cyanolysable sulphur (`S') per mol of enzyme. In contrast, batch I (0.68 ± 0.02 Cu; 1.13 ± 0.05 `S'), batch II (0.27 ± 0.02 Cu; 0.88 ± 0.06

Fig. 1a, b Native PAGE (a) and SDS-PAGE (b) of the CO dehydrogenase preparations (12.3≠13.6 lg per lane) referred to as batch I (2.1 U mg¿1), batch II (0.8 U mg¿1) and batch III (2.2 U mg¿1), stained for protein. The subunits of CO dehydrogenase are indicated by CoxL, CoxM, and CoxS

`S'), and batch III (0.52 ± 0.01 Cu; 1.22 ± 0.16 `S') were low in Cu and cyanolysable sulphur, which indicates the anticipated high level of immature forms of CO dehydrogenase in these preparations. Generation of a [MoO3] centre in the active site of CO dehydrogenase Our strategy to rebuild a functional [CuSMoO2] centre was designed to start from a [MoO3] centre. Potassium cyanide has been established to react with both, the sulphane sulphur substituent at the Mo-ion as well as the Cu-ion coordinated by the Sc of the cysteine 388

522

residue [2]. The reaction required the oxidized state of the enzyme. The removal of Cu and S from the active site changes the functional [CuSMoO2] centre into a non-functional [MoO3] centre [2]. Exposure of mature CO dehydrogenase as well as of the immature forms (batches I≠III) to potassium cyanide fully abolished their CO oxidizing activity within $8≠10 h (Fig. 2a, b, curves a). Inactivation was paralleled by characteristic changes in the Mo-EPR spectra indicative of the formation of a [MoO3] centre, a mention of which follows. Resulphuration of the [MoO3] centre Treatment of [MoO3] CO dehydrogenase with sodium sulphide and sodium dithionite for about 15 h restored the sulphur group at the Mo-ion approaching 2 mol of cyanolysable `S' per mol of enzyme (Fig. 2c). Obviously, this treatment is effective in the insertion of a sulphur atom from sodium sulphide into the [MoO3] center yielding a [MoO2S] center. The latter did not catalyze the oxidation of CO (Fig. 2a, b, curves b) referring to a nonfunctional Mo-centre. This is in contrast to the mononuclear Mo-hydroxylases, e.g., milk xanthine oxidase, chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidoreductase [24], where resulphuration generates a functional Mo-centre. We have examined resulphurated CO dehydrogenase for the ability to oxidize xanthine with oxygen as an electron acceptor yielding uric acid. The [MoO2S] enzyme was inactive, either because the [MoO2S] centre of CO dehydrogenase is not reactive with xanthine or because the substrate channel leading from the surface of the enzyme to its active site is too narrow to allow access to the compound. Reconstitution of milk xanthine dehydrogenase with sodium sulphide and sodium dithionite abolished the slow Mo-EPR signal and restored the rapid signal characteristic of the functional sulpho enzyme [24]. In contrast, resulphuration of the [MoO2S] centre of CO dehydrogenase did not alter the slow EPR signal. This data indicates that the slow signal is elicited by both types of centers, which will be discussed hereinafter. Transfer of Cu from the Cu(I)≠thiourea complex to the [MoO2S] centre [MoO2S] CO dehydrogenase was prepared from the mature enzyme as well as from the immature enzyme batches I≠III by potassium cyanide treatment and subsequent resulphuration as described previously. The enzyme preparations thus obtained were treated with Cu(I)≠thiourea under anoxic conditions for $2≠3 h (Fig. 2a, b, curves c, Fig. 2d). The treatment restored the specific CO oxidizing activity to $48% of the maximum activity ($44% spectroscopic functionality) with all preparations employed. The activities coincided with the content of cyanolysable sulphur in the reactivated enzymes (e.g., 0.9 mol `S' per mol dimer in batch III). As

Curve d shows treatment of the active enzyme with the Cu(I)≠thiourea complex. b CO dehydrogenase (batch III, 2.2 U mg¿1) was successively treated with potassium cyanide (curve a), sodium sulphide plus sodium dithionite (curve b), and Cu(I)≠thiourea (curve c). The active enzyme preparation was also treated with Cu(I)≠thiourea (curve d), or sodium sulphide plus sodium dithionite (curve e), or sodium sulphide plus sodium dithionite followed by Cu(I)≠thiourea (curve f). The percentage activities have been calculated from the indicated specific activities assuming a specific activity of 23 U mg¿1 of mature CO dehydrogenase. c incorporation of cyanolysable sulphur into [MoO3] CO dehydrogenase upon treatment with sodium sulphide plus sodium dithionite. The [MoO3] CO dehydrogenase was prepared by potassium cyanideinactivation of the batch III preparation (2.2 U mg¿1). d the CO dehydrogenase preparations of batch I (2.1 U mg¿1, curve I), batch II (0.8 U mg¿1, curve II), and batch III (2.2 U mg¿1, curve III) were successively treated with potassium cyanide and sodium sulphide plus sodium dithionite. Reactivation of the preparations were monitored upon treatment with Cu(I)≠thiourea. e native CO dehydrogenase preparations of batch I (2.1 U mg¿1, curve I), batch II (0.8 U mg¿1, curve II), and batch III (2.2 U mg¿1, curve III) were treated with Cu(I)≠thiourea. f The dependence of functional reconstitution on the pH was examined with native CO dehydrogenase (batch III) treated with Cu(I)≠thiourea at pH 6 (curve l), pH 7.2 (curve m), or pH 8.2 (curve h)

will be shown later, the procedure we have established for reactivation produces an active CO dehydrogenase. However, reconstitution of the functional [CuSMoO2] cluster is intrinsically coupled to the formation of a nonfunctional [MoO3] centre, irrespective of the enzyme batch employed. Cu(I)≠thiourea did not activate the 23 U CO dehydrogenase (Fig. 2a, curve d). This agrees with the presence of a complete [CuSMoO2] cluster in the mature enzyme and also indicates that Cu(I) is not noxious to the enzyme. Cu(I) was chosen because it has the same reduction state as in the functional [CuSMoO2] cluster. Cu(II)Cl2 (100 lM) inactivated CO dehydrogenase (batch III) within 30 h of incubation under nitrogen. Thiourea was required to increase the solubility of the Cu(I)-ion and to suppress hydroxide formation. Reactivation of CO dehydrogenase was also achieved with Cu(I)Cl under anoxic conditions in the absence of thiourea. However, the reaction was slow and did not go to completion, even after treatment for 9 h. Anoxic conditions and sodium ascorbate as a mild reductant were required to prevent the oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) or the disproportionation of Cu(I) to Cu(0) and Cu(II). Reactivation of CO dehydrogenase with Cu(I)≠thiourea depended on the appropriate pH (Fig. 2f). Although the reaction proceeded rapidly at pH 6.0≠7.2, maximum activation efficiency was achieved at slightly alkaline conditions (pH 8.2). Therefore, pH 8.2 has been chosen for all routine reconstitution experiments. Separation of CO dehydrogenase from the other constituents of the reactivation assay by gel filtration did not alter the activity of the reconstituted enzyme.

Native CO dehydrogenase preparations of low activity were significantly activated by direct treatment with Cu(I)≠thiourea (Fig. 2b, curve d, and Fig. 2e). The activity of batch III CO dehydrogenase (2.2 U mg¿1) was increased to 9.6 ± 0.3 U mg¿1, which corresponds

to 41.7% of the activity (39% spectroscopic functionality) of the fully functional enzyme. When the batch III enzyme was first subjected to conditions of resulphuration (Fig. 2b, curve e) and subsequently treated with Cu(I)-thiourea a similar final activity (11.8 ± 0.5 U

524

mg¿1) was obtained (Fig. 2b, curve f). We conclude from this data that batch III CO dehydrogenase is composed of mature and immature forms of the enzyme. The removal of cyanolysable S and Cu from CO dehydrogenase decreased the absorption in the range 300≠600 nm in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). The resulting uv/vis spectra appear as being partially reduced. Integration of S and Cu reversed these changes and resulted in a fully oxidized spectrum (Fig. 3b). Similar observations have been made with the sulpho and desulpho forms of xanthine oxidase from bovine milk [25]. These authors have interpreted the spectral changes around 425 nm as being consistent with the Mo(VI) minus Mo(IV) difference spectrum of the enzyme. Fig. 3b shows that with CO dehydrogenase these spectral changes originate from both the sulphido group and the Cu ion. Crystal structure of reactivated CO dehydrogenase The CO dehydrogenase of batch III was treated with potassium cyanide, reactivated through resulphuration and reconstitution with the Cu(I)≠thiourea complex (Fig. 2b, curves a, b, and c) and then crystallized, transformed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. A data set ∞ collected at the synchrotron to 1.7 A resolution was used for structural analysis. The structure has been refined to an R-factor of 16.6% and Rfree-factor of 19.4% (Table 1). The overall structure was indistinguishable to the one reported before of the fully functional native CO dehydrogenase [2] and showed the iron sulphur centers, the flavin cofactor and the MCD-molybdenum cofactor at their right positions. The Mo position was fully occupied, which is in agreement with the metal analysis of the enzyme. Clear electron densities at the positions occupied by Cu, the equatorial S-ligand, and the two O-ligands in the mature CO dehydrogenase are consistent with a [CuSMoO2] cluster in the reconstituted enzyme (Fig. 4a, b). This agrees with the capability of the reconstituted enzyme to oxidize CO (Fig. 2b, curve c). The reconstituted CO dehydrogenase is a mixture of the mature and immature forms, as is apparent from the following considerations. Adjustment of the B-factors indicates approximate occupancies of 60% for the Cuion and 75% for the sulphido group, which refers to the presence of about 40% of immature CO dehydrogenase in the preparation of the reconstituted enzyme. Weak ∞ residual density appeared at a distance of 3.3 A from the Mo-ion in the vicinity of the carboxyl group of Glu763 (Fig. 4a, c). An anomalous difference Fourier map shows a weak scattering contribution at this position interpreted as a metal, presumably Cu with an occupancy of about 20% (referred to as X in Fig. 4). This view is bolstered by the coordination environment composed of the carboxyl oxygens of Glu763, the amide nitrogen of Ser389, and the equatorial O-ligand of Mo ∞ forming a T-shaped geometry. The distance of 2.2 A

between the bridging Cu and the extra Cu excludes their appearance in the same form of the enzyme. We, therefore, conclude that part of the [MoO3] enzyme ∞ harbors a Cu ion at 3.4 A from the Mo ion at the nonfunctional site. Reactivated CO dehydrogenase routinely revealed more Cu (5≠7 moles per mol protein) than can be explained on the basis of the Cu content of the mature enzyme (2 moles per mol protein) alone. The crystal structure of reactivated CO dehydrogenase indicates the proper reconstruction of the [CuSMoO2] cluster in the active site of the enzyme. The additional Cu could not be seen at defined positions in the crystal structure, suggesting unspecific interactions with the protein. We were interested to solve the structure of the resulphurated Mo-site, particularly with respect to the positions actually occupied by the introduced sulphur. The crystal structure of the reconstituted CO dehydrogenase shown in Fig. 4 does not show the Mo≠S group at the unproductive equatorial position because it is removed through reaction with Cu(I) ion and subsequent replacement by water (Fig. 6). Therefore, the [MoO3] CO dehydrogenase was treated with sodium sulphide plus sodium dithionite, gel filtrated, crystallized, transformed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The ∞ crystals thus obtained diffracted to a maximum of 2.3 A. Unfortunately, this resolution proved to be insufficient to distinguish between oxo and sulphide ligands in the equatorial plane of the Mo-ion. Analysis of reconstitution by EPR The mature 23 U CO dehydrogenase in the air-oxidized state and its [MoO3] derivative obtained by potassium cyanide treatment were silent in the Mo-EPR signal (Fig. 5b, traces a, b). Titration of the mature enzyme with sodium dithionite generated the complex Mo(V) signal, which is elicited from [CuSMoO2] (Fig. 5b, trace c). Treatment with potassium cyanide inactivates the enzyme (Fig. 2a, curve a). Concomitantly the complex EPR signal was abolished and replaced by a slow signal (Fig. 5b, trace d). The latter is characteristic of a nonfunctional Mo-center [2, 27]. This data indicates that the CO dehydrogenase preparation of batch III (Fig. 5a, trace f) mainly contains nonfunctional Mo-centers. Reconstitution of batch III CO dehydrogenase was monitored by EPR starting from a resting Mo(V) signal in the air-oxidized state (Fig. 5a, trace a), which is attributed to a naturally occurring [Mo(V)O2SH] centre [27, 28]. Treatment of sodium dithionite-reduced CO dehydrogenase with potassium cyanide, resulphuration of the potassium cyanide-treated enzyme, or potassium cyanide-treatment of the resulphurated enzyme did not significantly change the slow Mo-EPR signal (Fig. 5 a, traces f≠i). This data indicates that the slow signal is elicited by both types of centres, [MoO3] as well as [MoO2S] and, therefore, cannot be taken as bona fide evidence of a desulpho Mo-ion. The fact that enzyme treated with sodium sulphide plus sodium dithionite was

activated by the Cu(I)≠thiourea complex (Fig. 2b, curve c; Fig. 5a, trace k) establishes that the slow signal shown in Fig. 5a, trace h, is indeed elicited by a [MoO2S] centre. The above mentioned additional copper atom (referred to as X) or the copper interacting unspecifically with the reactivated enzyme, respectively, are observed in the airoxidized state as a Cu2+ EPR signal (Fig. 5a, trace e). Reconstitution of the resulphurated enzyme (Fig. 5a, trace h) with Cu(I)≠thiourea generated a mixture of the complex Mo(V) signal elicited by the functional [CuSMoO2] center and a slow signal of the nonfunctional [MoO3]- and/or [MoO2S]-centers (Fig. 5a, trace k), which is apparent from the difference spectra. Subtraction of the spectrum of the mature 23 U CO dehydrogenase (Fig. 5b, trace c) from the spectrum of reactivated CO dehydrogenase (Fig. 5a, trace k) yielded a spectrum characteristic of the [MoO3]- and/or [MoO2S]-enzyme (Fig. 5b, trace e). The spectrum of functional CO dehydrogenase was obtained (Fig. 5b, trace f) from the difference of the reconstituted enzyme

(Fig. 5a, trace k) and the potassium cyanide-treated enzyme (Fig. 5a, trace g). The two signals in the reconstituted CO dehydrogenase occurred at approximately equimolar ratio. That reconstitution leads to a mixture of mature [CuSMoO2] CO dehydrogenase and immature forms are also evident from EPR spectra produced upon exposure of the enzyme to its substrate CO. The reconstituted CO dehydrogenase in the air-oxidized state (Fig. 5a, trace e) in the presence of CO gave an EPR spectrum characteristic of the CO-reduced [CuSMo(V)O2] center of the mature enzyme (Fig. 5b, trace g). The immature form of the enzyme present in the preparation does not react with CO and is EPR silent. When the spectrum of CO dehydrogenase reacted with CO (Fig. 5b, trace g) was subtracted from the spectrum of the same enzyme subsequently reduced with sodium dithionite (Fig. 5b, trace h), again a slow signal referring to nonfunctional [MoO3]-/ [MoO2S]-centers was obtained.

Conclusions
The studies described here have shown that in situ chemical reconstitution of the [MoO3] forms in CO dehydrogenase preparations (Fig. 6, compound 2) proceeds efficiently and quantitatively in the presence of sodium sulphide plus sodium dithionite under anoxic conditions giving rise to a [MoO2S] centre (Fig. 6, compound 3a), with the extent of reconstitution corresponding to the Mo content of the samples. Under the conditions established, Cu(I) is then transferred from the

Fig. 6 Pictorial representation of the chemical reconstruction of a functional [CuSMoO2] cluster starting from a nonfunctional [MoO3] center in the active site of CO dehydrogenase, and proposed mechanism. The route depicted in grey shows a model of the concomitant formation of a nonfunctional [MoO3] center

Cu(I)≠thiourea complex to the [MoO2S] center yielding a [CuSMoO2] cluster (Fig. 6, compound 1), which has the catalytically active structure and is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of CO. Mature CO dehydrogenase is synthesized in O. carboxidovorans along with immature forms of the enzyme, which are subject to posttranslational maturation of the Mo centre. We have shown that the natural immature forms equivalent to compounds 2 and 3a of Fig. 6 can be reconstituted and reactivated as well. Other than expected, reconstitution of the Mo-center of CO dehydrogenase with S and Cu (1) did not exceed

50% of the reactivation corresponding to the Mo content or the maximum activity (Fig. 2), (2) revealed only half of the cyanolysable sulphur contents present before Cu(I)≠transfer, (3) exhibited a Mo-EPR spectrum characteristic of the functional and a nonfunctional Mocenter at an approximately 1:1 ratio (Fig. 5a, trace k), and (4) showed a functional [CuSMoO2] active site along with a nonfunctional metal site in the crystal structure (Fig. 4). The formation of a functional and a nonfunctional metal center in the course of chemical reconstitution can be explained by assuming equivalent resulphuration at both equatorial positions of the Mo

528

ion, resulting in compounds 3a and 3b (Fig. 6). Compound 3a reacts in a productive fashion, whereas compound 3b does not. In the productive route, the Cu(I) ion reacts with the MoS of compound 3a and is then stabilized through coordination by the Sc of Cys388. In the nonproductive route, the Cu(I) ion reacts with the MoS of compound 3b, where the S atom occupies the ∞ other equatorial position. The distance of more than 3 A between the Cu and the Sc of Cys388 precludes any stable coordination, and as a consequence Cu2S is presumably released and an oxo group is introduced from water. The resulting [MoO3] center is in accord with the EPR spectra (Fig. 5a, trace k) and the crystallographic data (Fig. 4). The chemical transformation of nonfunctional [MoO3] to functional [CuSMoO2] in CO dehydrogenase involves (1) reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(IV), (2) attachment of the sulphido group to the Mo-ion, (3) reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), (4) formation of the Cu(I)≠ thiourea complex, and (5) escort and integration of the Cu(I) to the cluster (Fig. 6). The gene products, which fulfil these functions in the bacterial cell are not yet known. However, when the genes coxD, coxE, and coxF were inactivated by insertion of a kanamycine resistance cassette, the CO dehydrogenases characterized from the resulting mutants were defective in the proper assembly of the [CuSMoO2] cluster (O. Meyer, unpublished data). For instance, the CO dehydrogenase of coxD::km contained a [MoO3] center. The functions of coxDEF are subject to current research in our laboratory. There is no indication that structure 3b (Fig. 6) appears in living bacteria, which argues against the existence of the unproductive path in vivo.
