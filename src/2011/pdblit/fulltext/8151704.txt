Abstract-The

syntheses, crystal structures and electronic structures of the new p4-vinylidene clusters, Fe4(CO)12(C-_OCH3)2) and Fe4(CO)r2(C=C(OCH3)CH3), are reported. Fe,(CO) 12(eC(OCH3)2) was prepared by the methylation of [Fe,(CO) r2(CCO,CH3)]with trimethyloxonium fluoroborate in methylene chloride at 25°C. Fe4(CO),2(e C(OCH 3)CH3) was prepared in an analogous manner from [Fe,(CO), ,(CC(O)CH 3)]-. Fe4(CO),2(CLC(OCH3)2) crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2,/c (C2h5 No. 14) with a = 13.900(2), b = 8.909(2), c = 17.116(4) A, /? = 94.59(2)"; pcalc= 2.03 g cme3 for mol. wt 645.6 and 2 = 4. Fe,(CO), 2(C=C(OCH3)CH3) crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2,/c (C2h5 No. 14) with a = 28.441(6), b = 9.204(2), c = 17.466(4) A, /? = 108.51(2)" ; pcalc= 1.93 g cmp3 for mol. wt = 629.6 and 2 = 8. Both clusters have an open butterfly core of four iron atoms with the vinylidene ligand bound to all four metal atoms. Molecular orbital calculations using the Fenske-Hall method were carried out for the two clusters. The molecular and electronic structures of the molecules are compared with each other and with those of p4-methylidyne clusters. Although both of these clusters contain a formal C-C double bond in the vinylidene ligand, the presence of oxygen atoms in these ligands leads to a delocalized 7csystem and only partial double bond character in this C-C bond. Changes in the structure of the cluster framework can be correlated with the oxygen content and thus double bond character in the vinylidene ligand.

The chemistry of transition metal clusters with an open butterfly geometry, bearing a p4-carbide ligand, and of their p4-methylidyne analogues, is of continuing interest. These compounds exhibit unique chemistry by virtue of the geometry of the binding site of the carbon ligand atom. ' This family of molecules also has an additional attraction in that it may provide structural parallels to the chemisorbed state of organic molecules in four-fold sites on metal surfaces, parallels not provided by the higher symmetry molecular clusters most often found in organometallic cluster chemistry.

Some homometallic tetrairon clusters of this type which have been characterized by X-ray diffraction are shown in the Scheme 1. Fe,(CO), 3C (1),2 [Fe4(CO)r2C]`- (2)3 and [HFe4(CO)r2C]- (3)4 all contain a p4-carbide ligand. HFe,(CO), 2CH (4)' is derived from 2 or 3 by protonation,4'6 from 2 by oxidation under hydrogem6 or from 1 by treatment with hydrogen.7 [Fe,(CO), 2(CC02CH3)]- (5) is derived from 1 by reaction with methanol,2 and [Fe,(CO), 2(CC(0)CH3)]- (6) results from the reaction of methyl iodide with 2.3 The corresponding dianion of 6, which has a similar structure, has also been reported.' HFe,(CO), 3(COCH3) (7) is derived from the non-carbide cluster [Fe,(CO), 2]2by sequential methylation and protonation4 We have extended the range of p4-organic ligands in this cluster group by preparing two new p4-vinylidene clusters, Fe,(CO), 2(CLC(OCH3)2) (8) and Fe4(CO) I K=C@CHWH3) (9) [es.

(2) X-ray crystallography The crystal structure of 8 was determined in the Analytical Sciences Laboratory, Exxon Research and Engineering Company. The crystal structure of 9 was determined at Crystalitics Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska. The structure of Fe,(CO), Z(C=C(OCH3)J (8). Crystals of 8 were grown from hexane at -40°C. Data were collected on an approximately cubic crystal, 0.44 mm on an edge, sealed under nitrogen in a glass capillary, on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer using MO-K, radiation (A = 0.7107 A). The cluster crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2Jc (C2h5 No. 14) with a = 13.900(2), b = 8.909(2), c = 17.116(4) A, /YI 94.59(2)"; = pcalc= 2.03 g cme3 for mol. wt 645.6 and Z = 4. Of range reflections examined (scan 3696 0 < 28 < 50", ~28 scans, 2-7" min- `), 1528 with Z > 2oZ were used in structure solution, using a combination of direct methods (MULTAN) and Fourier techniques, and refinement by full-matrix least-squares. No decay in intensity of three check reflections was observed during data collection. Data were corrected for absorption (p = 27.6 cm- `, psi scan, max/min 0.83-1.00) and for Lorentz and polarization factors. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. Leastsquares refinement converged to final residuals of R, = 0.054, R2 = 0.044." Interatomic distances and bond angles are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The atom numbering scheme is shown in the ORTEP drawing of the molecule, Fig. 1, in which thermal ellipsoids are drawn to include 30% of the electron density. The structure of Fe4(CO), ,(C==C(OCH3)CH3) (9). Crystals of 9 were grown from hexane at - 40°C. Data were collected on a crystal measuring 0.42 x 0.42 x 0.70 mm, sealed under nitrogen in a glass capillary, on a four circle Nicolet Autodiffractometer. The molecule crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2Jc (Czh5 No. 14) with a = 28.441(6), b = 9.204(2), c = 17.466(4) A, p = 108.51(2)"; pcalc= 1.93 g cmm3 for mol. wt = 629.6 and Z = 8. The intensities of six check reflections were monitored over the period of data collection and no decay was observed. Of 595 1 independent reflections collected (0 < 28 < 45") 3364 with Z > 3a(Z) were used in the structure solution (SHELXTL direct methods) and refinement (cascade block-diagonal least-squares). Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms were not located. Least-

EXPERIMENTAL (1) Syntheses All preparative procedures were performed in standard Schlenk glassware on a double manifold vacuum-nitrogen line. Fe,(CO), 2(C=C(OCH3)2) (8) was prepared by the methylation of [Fe,(C0) , 2(CC02CHJ(5) with trimethyloxonium fluoroborate in methylene chloride at 25°C. Fe,(CO), 2(C=C(OCH,)CH,) (9) was prepared in an analogous manner from [Fe,(CO), 2(CC(0)CH3)](6). The starting materials for 8 and 9 were prepared by published procedures.g Fe4(CO),2(C=C(OCH3)2) (8). To a solution of (CZHJ4N[Fe4(CO)~~(CCWJHJ1 (5) (1.50 g, 1.95 mmol) in methylene chloride (100 cm') was added trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate (0.29 1 g, 1.95 mmol) and the green-black mixture was stirred for 24 h. During this time the solution became a paler green, and the IR absorbances of the starting material were replaced by new bands at 2080,2040, 2010, 1992 and 1950 cm- `. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue extracted into boiling hexane (4 x 50 cm'). The product, 8, crystallizes on cooling the filtrate to room temperature. A second crop may be obtained by cooling the filtrate to -40°C. Combined yield of 8 = 0.800 g (1.24 mmol, 64%).

To a solution of (C,H,)4N[Fe4(CO),,(CC(0)CH3)1 (5.0 g, 6.7 mmol) in methylene chloride (350 cm3) was added trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate (1.Og, 6.7 mmol) in an identical manner to the preparation of 8. The colour of the solution changed from dark green to red-brown, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by the replacement of the IR absorbantes of the starting material with those of the vinylidene product. After completion of the methylation reaction the solution was filtered and evaporated to dryness.

are used for comparison here. Atomic positions used in the calculations for 8 and 9 were taken from the crystal structures reported here. The 1s through 3d functions for iron were taken from Richardson et al., " while the 4s and 4p functions were chosen to have exponents of 2.0. The carbon and oxygen functions were taken from the double-l: functions of Clementi. I6 The valence 2p functions were retained as the double-l functions, while the 1s and 2s functions were reduced to the single-c form. An exponent of 1.2 was used for hydrogen. In all of the calculations the local coordinate system on the vinylidene carbon was oriented with the x-axis parallel to a line connecting the two hinge iron atoms, Fe, and Fe,, the y-axis parallel to a line connecting the two wingtip iron atoms, Fe, and Fe,, and the z axis pointing out of the cluster. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Structural parameters for 8 and 9 are listed in Tables 1 and 2. In making comparisons between

the clusters we will use for 9 structural parameters which are the mean of those found for the two crystallographically independent molecules in the unit cell. The structures of the vinylidene clusters 8 and 9 are nominally similar in that the four iron atoms are arranged in an open butterfly configuration, each bearing three essentially linear terminal carbonyl ligands coordinated in the usual mutually orthogonal fashion to the iron atoms. The two clusters are also similar in that in each a vinylidene ligand -C(R,)(R,) is bonded in a p4>c fashion through the vinylidene carbon to the four iron atoms which make up the core of the butterfly clusters. Examination of the geometries of the Fe, units in the two clusters reveals subtle but significant differences between them. These differences can be most easily expressed by comparing the cluster structures of 8 and 9 with the structures of their anionic precursors 5 and 614 (see Fig. 3). The dihedral angles between the wings of the butterfly in 8 (127") and 9 (122") are slightly smaller

symmetric dispositions of the CO groups than are than those in 5 (130") and 6 (128"). The two vinylfound in 5 and 6. idene clusters also differ slightly in their Fe-Fe In order to understand these changes in structure bond lengths ; for 8 the Fe(l)-Fe(2,3) and Fe(4)-Fe(2,3) distances are 2.50 and 2.55 8, (com- it is useful to compare the electronic, as well as the molecular structures, of these clusters with the same pared with 2.51 fO.O1 A for 5), and for 9, 2.59 and features of other members of the iron butterfly 2.54 A (compared with 2.5Of.O.01 A for 6). These differences are also reflected in the Fe-C(l3) dis- group of clusters. We have previously shown how tances : for 8 the Fe(2,3)-C(13) distances are the structures of carbido clusters such as 1, 2 and 3, which contain a p4-carbon atom, and those of 2.02LO.01 A (2.01 8, in 5) and the Fe(l,4)---C(13) distances are 1.96 8, (1.95 A in 5); for 9 the cor- methylidyne clusters such as 5 and 6, which conresponding distances are 1.98 and 1.93 8, (2.01 and tain a p4-methylidyne ligand, reflect the electronic 1.96 A for 6). Finally, these differences can also be structures of both the Fe,(CO) , 2 core and the carexpressed in terms of the Fe(2)C( 13)Fe(3) angles in bido carbon atom or methylidyne group.`3,`4 In the vinylidene clusters. In 8 and 9 the angles are order to make an instructive comparison between 149.5" (147.9" in 5) and 157.7" (148.6" in 6). In all three classes of cluster, it is useful to review short, while the geometry of 8 shows only small briefly the relationship between the electronic and changes from the geometry of 5, somewhat larger geometric structures of the p4-carbon and ,u4-methchanges in geometry are observed in 9 in com- ylidyne clusters. In the p4-carbon clusters, 1, 2 and parison with 6. Most noticeable is the closing up of 3, the cluster geometry optimizes the interactions the Fe, butterfly framework which is observed in between the carbido carbon atom and the four iron atoms. The important Fe-C interactions are 9. It should also be noted that the C(13)-C(14) distance in both 8 and 9 is 1.44 8, (compared to 1.49 shown in Fig. 4. The near colinearity of the two A in both 5 and 6). The small change in this bond wingtip iron atoms (Fe,) and the p4-carbon atom interactions. These length between the methylidyne and vinylidene clus- leads to very strong C-Fe, ters is somewhat surprising, since the C( 13)-C( 14) include a 0 overlap involving the C 2p, orbital [Fig. bond in both 8 and 9 can be viewed formally as a 4(a)], and n overlaps involving the C 2p, and 2p, double bond, while in both 5 and 6 this bond is orbitals [Fig. 4(b,c)]. The C 2p, orbital does not overviewed as a single bond.

the p4-carbon atom and the carbomethoxy and acetyl groups. I4 The bond formation is accompanied by a folding back of the wings of the butterfly (the dihedral angle increases from 102 + 2 to 129 f 1 "), a lengthening of the C-Fe,,, distances (from 1.79 + 0.01 to 2.02 & 0.01 A) and a shortening of the Fe,-Fe, distances (from 2.63 LO.01 to 2.51 kO.02 A). In these derivatized clusters nearly all of the n bonding between the carbon atom and the wingtip iron atoms is lost and the 0 bond between the carbon atom and the wingtip iron atoms is considerably weakened. This is illustrated in Fig. 5. The C 2p, orbital, hybridized with the C 2s orbital, is used in bonding to the adjacent carbon atom. This leaves a C sp lone pair type orbital to bond with the hinge iron atoms [Fig. 5(c)], but no orbital for rc bonding with the wingtip iron atoms. The C 2p, orbital is unaffected by the formation of the C-C bond, but the much longer C-Fe, distance results in the loss of most of the n bonding with the wingtip iron atoms. Finally, the c bond between the C p,, orbital and the wingtip iron atoms is also weakened as a result of the longer C-Fe, distance. The loss of bonding between the carbon atom and the Fe, is compensated by the strengthening of the Few--Fe,, bonds. At the same time, the C 2p, orbital is somewhat stabilized by bonding to the adjacent carbon atom. Since the carbomethoxy and acetyl carbonyl groups in 5 and 6 lie in the xz plane, this allows the development of a small amount of double bond character between the methylidyne carbon and the adjacent sp2 carbon. In the methyilidyne clusters, 5 and 6, the C-C bond can be viewed formally as a single bond. In the vinylidene clusters, 8 and 9, on the other hand, the C-C bond can be viewed formally as a double bond, and we might expect both the interaction

between the vinylidene group and the Fe4(CO),, cluster core and the resulting cluster geometry itself to be somewhat different in 8 and 9 from that found in 5 and 6. Instead, with only the small variations noted above, the cluster framework geometries of the vinylidene clusters 8 and 9 resemble those of their precursors 5 and 6. The results of Fenske-Hall electronic structure calculations for the vinylidene clusters show that it is in fact not appropriate to view these ligands as having a localized double bond between the two carbons. At most, the C( 13)-X( 14) bond in these ligands is intermediate between single and double bond in character, and the small differences in geometry reflect the gradual appearance of partial double bond character in this C-C bond. The degree to which this occurs depends on the substituents on the vinyl carbon atom, C( 14). In the methylidyne clusters, 5 and 6, the interaction between the methylidyne C 2p,, orbital and the cluster framework is illustrated as the interaction between a lone pair 2p, orbital and the cluster framework [Fig. 5(a)]. That this is an appropriate picture can be seen by viewing the bonding in the methylidyne clusters in terms of the Fe4(C0),2 framework and the CC(O)R (R = OCH3, CH,) fragment. The CC(O)R fragment orbital which interacts with the wingtip metal framework orbitals is localized primarily on the methylidyne carbon and is C 2p, in character. This is illustrated in Fig. 6(a) and (b), where schematic diagrams of this fragment molecular orbital (m.o.) in [-CC(O)OCH,](6a) and [-CC(O)CH$ (6b) are shown. The coefficients of the atomic orbitals in each fragment molecular orbital are also indicated in Fig. 6. The methylidyne carbon 2p, orbital makes a small contribution to two other lower lying

p4-Vinylidene tetrairon clusters fragment n orbitals, but these lower lying orbitals are primarily localized on the oxygen end of the fragment and are bonding between oxygen and the $-carbon. It is the x lone pair type orbital shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b) which participates in the bonding interaction shown in Fig. 5(a). If the vinylidene fragments in clusters 8 and 9 actually incorporated a C-C double bond, we might expect the interaction between the vinylidene carbon and the wingtip iron atoms to be somewhat different from that shown in Fig. 5(a). A localized double bond between the two adjacent carbon atoms would preclude the presence of a C pY nonbonding orbital. Instead, we would expect to observe an orbital with contributions from the pY orbitals of both carbon atoms and a concentration of electron density in a region between the two carbons. This is not observed in the two vinylidene fragments, -CC(OCH& and -CC(OCH,)CH3. Instead, the bonding within these two fragments more closely resembles the bonding in the methylidyne fragments in 5 and 6 described above. Both fragments have an orbital which is primarily C 2~7, in character [Fig. 6(c) and (d)], and once again it is this fragment orbital which participates in the cluster bonding interaction illustrated in Fig. 5(a). It is notable that this orbital is more localized on the vinylidene carbon in -CC(OCH,), than in -CC(OCH3)CH3, and we will discuss this difference below. In each fragment the vinylidene C 2p, orbital also makes a smaller contribution to one or

1817

more lower energy it orbitals, but these lower energy orbitals are primarily bonding between the oxygen(s) and the sp2 hybridized carbon. When the electronic structure of the ligands is viewed in this light, we can understand the observed similarities and small differences in cluster geometry. As described above and illustrated in Fig. 5, the formation of a C-C bond in the methylidyne clusters 5 and 6 leads to the loss of nearly all C-Fe, n bonding, so that the only remaining strong C-Fe, interaction involves the non-bonding rctype orbital localized on the methylidyne carbon atom [Fig. 5(a)]. In the vinylidene cluster 8, bonding between the vinylidene group and the Fe,(CO)I2 cluster is almost identical to that observed in clusters 5 and 6. That is, the rr lone pair orbital illustrated in Fig. 6(c) interacts with the metal framework in the manner illustrated in Fig. 5(a). This bonding mode and the consequent structure indicates that in 8 it is appropriate to view the C-C bond in the "vinylidene" ligand -CC(OCH3)2 as closer to a single bond than a double bond. In the vinylidene cluster 9 the interaction between the vinylidene group and the metal framework still resembles the interaction shown in Fig. 5(a), but, as shown in Fig. 6(d), the vinylidene n orbital involved in this interaction is not as strongly localized on the vinylidene carbon in 9 as it is in 8. That is, we see a small shift in electron density away from the vinylidene carbon atom. The smaller dihedral angle in 9 can be correlated to the change in charac-

ter of this vinylidene orbital. Since the only interaction between the wingtip iron atoms and the vinylidene carbon atom requires the participation of the electrons which occupy this orbital, the metal framework of the cluster closes up around the vinylidene group in order to gain access to these electrons. Both the character of the vinylidene rc orbital and the cluster geometry itself suggest that in 9 it is appropriate to view the C-C bond in the "vinylidene" ligand -CC(OCH,)(CH,) as something intermediate between a single and a double bond. It follows from these observations that in a vinylidene cluster containing a truly localized double bond an even smaller dihedral angle would be expected. Since the electrons needed for bonding between the vinylidene ligand and the wingtip iron atoms would now be localized between the two carbon atoms, it would be necessary for the metal framework of the cluster to close up even further than in 8 and 9 in order to gain access to these electrons. An example of a butterfly cluster containing a localized vinylidene ligand is found in Fe,(CO),2(C=CHCH& which has also been synthesized in this laboratory. The structure of this cluster, which will be reported in a subsequent paper, demonstrates precisely this phenomenon." The dihedral angle in this cluster is 104". It is interesting to note that the analogous cluster HFe,(CO) , *(CBH&, recently reported by Fehlner which should have a similar and co-workers" electronic structure, has a dihedral angle of 105". Appropriate depictions of clusters 8 and 9 are shown below. As discussed above the C-C double bond character in the vinylidene ligands is greater in 9 than in 8. This increase in double bond character is accompanied by a shortening of the Fe-C bonds and a decrease in the dihedral angle between the two wings of the butterfly as shown in Fig. 3. This double bond character can be directly related to the number of oxygen atoms in the vinylidene group, since as the number of oxygen atoms decreases, the number of electrons available to participate in the 71 framework of the vinylidene group decreases, and

the C( 13)-C( 14) double bond character increases. The small amount of double bond character in the C( 13)-X2( 14) bond is consistent with the relatively slight shortening of this bond which is observed in going from 5 or 6 to 8 or 9. At the same time, we might have expected this bond to be shorter in 9 than in 8. We must remember, however, that in the cluster, electrons which in the vinylidene fragment would occupy only the fragment orbital illustrated in Fig. 6(d) now occupy a delocalized cluster orbital which incorporates contributions from both that fragment orbital and the wingtip iron atoms. This delocalization of the electrons onto the metal cluster, which decreases any localized electron density between the two carbon atoms, is consistent with the absence of any shortening of the C-C bond. Detailed comparisons between the CO coordination geometries in the pairs of molecules 5 and 8, 6 and 9, and 8 and 9 reveal marked distortions in the relative orientations of all four of the Fe(CO), groups in 8 and 9. For example, in going from 5 to 8 the two hinge Fe(C0)3 groups rotate with respect to each other by N 60", going from an almost perfectly eclipsed configuration to a staggered configuration. A similar relative rotation has been observed in the structure of the dianion of the acetylmethylidyne cluster 6. * In 8 and 9, rotations of the wingtip (CO) 3 groups are also observed. Just as for the dianion of 6, the results of the molecular orbital calculations for 8 and 9 reveal no ready electronic explanation for these changes in CO orientation, and the reorientation of the (CO), groups in 8 and 9 appears to be dictated by steric effects. Although we cannot give a full explanation of the relative magnitudes of these distortions, it is clear that in order to optimize the bonding interactions between the wingtip iron atoms and the vinylidene fragment, and at the same time accommodate the bulkiness of the substituents on the vinylidene ligand, the geometry of the Fe(C0)3 units must severely distort. Finally, it should be noted that the structures of the vinylidene clusters discussed here differ from the structures of other butterfly clusters such as (~-H)(~5-CpNi)Ru3(CO)g(~Lq-~2-C=CH-i-Pr)'g and (~5-CpFe)Co,(CO)7(~-CO),(~~-~2-C=CH2),20 which also contain vinylidene ligands. In these latter clusters the vinylidene ligand does not lie in the plane of the two hinge atoms but instead leans over and binds in an y2-manner to one of the wingtip metal atoms. At the same time, however, these latter clusters contain not only a localized vinylidene ligand, but also a heterometal and two extra cluster electrons. Comparisons between the electronic and

molecular structures of the simpler Fe, vinylidene clusters and the more complex heterometallic vinylidene clusters indicate that these are probably best viewed as two related but distinct groups of clusters. These comparisons will be described in a subsequent paper. ' 7

SUMMARY The syntheses, molecular and electronic structures of two p4-vinylidene tetrairon butterfly clusters, Fe,(CO), &I=C(OCH&) (8) and Fe,(CO), 2 (C=C(OCH3)CH3) (9) have been described. The clusters have an open butterfly framework of four iron atoms with a vinylidene ligand bound to all four metal atoms, and in both clusters the vinylidene ligand is approximately co-planar with the two hinge iron atoms. The Fe& cores of the two clusters are similar in structure to the Fe& cores of their precursor methylidyne clusters, with the most noticeable differences being slightly smaller dihedral angles in the vinylidene clusters. The disposition of the CO ligands is much less symmetric in the vinylidene clusters than in their methylidyne precursors. This reorientation of the CO ligands appears to be dictated by steric crowding which results from the bulkiness of the substituents on the vinylidene ligand combined with the smaller dihedral angle between the two wings of the butterfly. The small changes in core geometry can be attributed to the electronic structure of the vinylidene ligands. Although both clusters formally contain a C-C double bond in the vinylidene ligand, the presence of oxygen atoms in this ligand leads to a delocalized x system and only partial double bond character in the C-C bond. The double bond character increases as the number of oxygen atoms incorporated into the ligand decreases. The results of molecular orbital calculations show that changes in the structure of the cluster framework can be correlated with the double bond character in the vinylidene ligand, since an increase in double bond character leads to a shift in electron density away from the vinylidene carbon atom and a closing up
