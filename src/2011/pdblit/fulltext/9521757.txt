ABSTRACT: The structure of a formamidopyrimidine (FAPY) adduct arising from imidazole ring opening of the initially formed trans-8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 adduct under basic conditions and positioned in the 5-d(CTATFAPYGATTCA)-3·5-d(TGAATCATAG)-3 oligodeoxynucleotide was determined. The FAPY adduct may be a major progenitor of aflatoxin B1-induced mutations in DNA. The freshly prepared sample showed biphasic melting, with transitions at 28 and 56 °C. NMR initially showed multiple subspectra. Over a period of several days at 4 °C, the sample converted to a single species with a Tm of 56 °C, 15 °C greater than the unmodified duplex. The deoxyribose was in the configuration about the anomeric carbon, evidenced by NOEs between FAPYG5 H3, H2, H2, and H1. FAPY formation resulted in the loss of the guanine H8 proton, and the introduction of the formyl proton, which showed NOEs to FAPYG5 H1 and A6 N6Ha. A total of 31 NOEs from AFB1 to DNA protons were observed, mostly to the 5-neighboring base, T4 in the modified strand. Sequential NOEs were interrupted between T4 and FAPYG5 in the modified strand, between C16 and A17 in the complementary strand, and between T4 N3H and FAPYG5 N1H. An NOE between FAPYG5 N1H and C16 N4H showed intact hydrogen bonding at FAPYG5·C16. Upfield chemical shifts were observed for T4 H6 and A17 H8. Molecular dynamics calculations converged with pairwise rmsd differences of <0.9 Å. The sixth root residual was 8.7 × 10-2. The AFB1 moiety intercalated from the major groove between FAPYG5 and T4·A17, and stacked with T4 and FAPYG5 and partially stacked with A17. The base step between T4·A17 and FAPYG5·C16 was increased from 3.4 to 7 Å. The duplex unwound by about 15°. The FAPY formyl group was positioned to form a hydrogen bond with A6 N6Ha. Strong stacking involving the AFB1 moiety, and this hydrogen bond explains the thermal stabilization of four base pairs by this adduct, and may be a significant factor in its processing.

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)1 is the predominant mutagenic fungal metabolite which is isolated from Aspergillus flaVus, parasiticus, and nomius. This mycotoxin is of worldwide health concern because of the potential contamination of food (1). AFB1 is a mutagen in several tester strains of bacteria (2); it is a hepatocarcinogen in experimental animals (3, 4). Epidemiological studies suggest that it causes cancer in humans (3, 5, 6). AFB1 may be linked to site-specific transversions in the tumor suppression gene p53 (7, 8), and ras protooncogenes (4, 9). AFB1 is primarily metabolized in humans by cytochrome P450 3A4 (10) to yield the ultimate carcinogen, AFB1-exo This work was supported by NIH Research Grants CA-55678 (M.P.S.) and ES-03755 (T.M.H.).

8,9-epoxide (11). This is one of the most reactive epoxides known with t1/2 <1 s in H2O (12). The regioselectivity of DNA adduction is consistent with a mechanism whereby precovalent intercalation on the 5-face of guanine (13) places the epoxide in close proximity and in the proper orientation to the N7 position of guanine, thus facilitating a backside SN2 reaction (14) to yield trans-8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 (15).

Scheme 1: Numbering Scheme for the FAPY-Modified Oligodeoxynucleotide

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 13, 1998 4375 Adduct Preparation. The reaction of 5-d(CTATGATTCA)-3·5-d(AATCAT)-3 with AFB1-8,9-epoxide was carried out in a two-phase reaction system (CH2Cl2; 0.01 M sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.0) for 5 min at 0 °C. The aqueous phase was transferred into pH 9.0 (uncalibrated reading) Na2CO3 buffer and stirred at 25 °C for 6 h. The AFB1-FAPY-modified strand 5-d(CTATFAPYGATTCA)-3 was purified by HPLC on a YMC C18 reverse phase semiprep column (ODS-AQ, 250 × 10 mm). The FAPY adduct eluted at 14.5 min at a flow rate of 4.0 mL/min with a gradient of 9-16% CH3CN over 28 min in 0.01 M triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) buffer, pH 6.5. The AFB1FAPY adducted strand was digested enzymatically. The resulting FAPY nucleoside was compared with a standard from chemical synthesis and showed the correct mass spectrum of 613.2 for FAB+ (M + Na+). NMR Samples. The oligodeoxynucleotide concentrations were determined from extinction coefficients of 9.81 × 104 M-1·cm-1 for modified and 9.64 × 104 M-1·cm-1 for the complementary strands, calculated at 260 nm (22). The complementary oligodeoxynucleotides were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio. The mixture was heated to 65 °C for 5 min and was cooled to room temperature. The annealed duplex was lyophilized and redissolved in 0.5 mL of buffer solution containing 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, and 50 µM Na2EDTA at pH 6.8. The solutions were lyophilized and exchanged 3 times with 99.96% D2O. The strand concentrations of the samples were approximately 1.5 mM. The samples used for examining nonexchangeable protons were dissolved in 99.996% D2O buffer. The samples used for the examination of the exchangeable protons were in buffer solution containing 9:1 H2O/D2O. UV Melting. The experiments were carried out on a Varian Cary 4E spectrophotometer. The buffer was 10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.05 mM Na2EDTA, and 1 M NaCl at pH 7.0. The buffer solution was degassed prior to the experiment. The concentrations were adjusted to 4.8 × 10-6 M in a 1 cm cuvette. The temperature was increased at a rate of 0.5 °C/min from 2 to 85 °C. Absorbance was measured at 260 nm. The melting temperatures of the native and modified oligodeoxynucleotides were calculated by determining the midpoints of the melting curves from the first-order derivatives. NMR. NOESY and DQF-COSY experiments were performed at a 1H frequency of 750.13 MHz. TOCSY and ROESY experiments were performed at a 1H frequency of 500.13 MHz. The temperature was 25 °C. TMS was used to reference the spectra. Phase-sensitive NOESY spectra used in the resonance assignments were recorded using TPPI phase cycling with a mixing time of 350 ms. For examining exchangeable protons, phase-sensitive NOESY experiments were carried out in 9:1 H2O/D2O buffer at a 1H frequency of 600 MHz. The field-gradient watergate pulse sequence suppressed the water signal (23). The spectra were recorded at 5 °C with a mixing time of 250 ms. Phase-sensitive TOCSY experiments were performed using a mixing time of 80 ms and MLEV17 spin lock pulse with TPPI phase cycling. To derive the distance restraints from NOESY experiments, three NOESY spectra were recorded consecutively at mixing times of 150, 250, and 350 ms, respectively. In these experiments, the data were recorded with 1024 real

This cationic adduct undergoes base-catalyzed rearrangement to the trans-8,9-dihydro-8-(2,6-diamino-4-oxo-3,4dihydropyrimid-5-yl formamido)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 (FAPY) derivative in which the imidazole ring has opened (16). The FAPY derivative is chemically stable, and is reported to be longer-lived than the initially formed cationic adduct (17, 18). The FAPY adduct may be responsible for a significant fraction of AFB1-induced mutations. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in understanding how the AFB1-FAPY lesion perturbs duplex DNA. The related sterigmatocystin-FAPY lesion had the sterigmatocystin moiety intercalated on the 5-side of the modified guanine, but a refined structure was not obtained (19). This work presents a refined structure of an extraordinarily thermally stable AFB1-FAPY adduct. The adduct is embedded in the oligodeoxynucleotide d(CTATFAPYGATTCA)· d(TGAATCATAG), as shown in Scheme 1. Structural refinement, using molecular dynamics restrained by NOEbased distances, shows that the stacking of the AFB1 moiety above the 5-face of the modified guanine results in unwinding of the DNA by approximately 15°. While the cationic adduct increased the stability of the DNA duplex slightly (20), in this oligodeoxynucleotide the FAPY adduct stabilizes four base pairs surrounding the lesion. Intercalation of the FAPY moiety occurs with little or no adduct-induced bending of this duplex, and maximum stacking interactions with the modified and 5-neighbor base pairs. Moreover, refinement predicts the formation of a stabilizing hydrogen bond between the formyl group of the FAPY moiety and the exocyclic amino group of the 3-neighbor adenine. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. Oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The purities were checked by HPLC, and SureCheck oligodeoxynucleotide analysis kits (Amersham Life Science). AFB1 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI). Caution: Crystalline aflatoxins are hazardous due to their electrostatic nature and should be handled using appropriate containment procedures and respiratory mask to preVent inhalation. Aflatoxins can be destroyed by treatment with NaOCl. It should be assumed that aflatoxin epoxides are highly toxic and carcinogenic. Manipulations should be carried out in a well-Ventilated hood with suitable containment procedures. Dimethyldioxirane was prepared (21) and reacted with AFB1 to give AFB1-exo-8,9-epoxide (11).

4376 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 13, 1998 data in the d1 dimension and 2048 real data in the d2 dimension. The data were processed using FELIX (Biosym Technologies) on Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstations. The data in the d1 dimension were zero-filled to give a matrix of 2K × 2K real points. A sinebell apodization function with a 90° phase-shift was used in both dimensions. Structure Refinement. Footprints were drawn around the NOE cross-peaks for the NOESY spectrum measured at a mixing time of 350 ms to define the size and shape of the individual cross-peak using FELIX. The same set of footprints was applied to spectra measured at other mixing times. Cross-peak intensities were determined by volume integration of the areas under the footprints. The intensities were combined as necessary with intensities generated from complete relaxation matrix analysis of a starting DNA structure to generate a hybrid intensity matrix. MARDIGRAS (24) was used to iteratively refine the hybrid matrix to optimize the agreement with experimental NOE intensities. Classical B-DNA and A-DNA (25, 26) were used to create reference structures. The AFB1 moiety was intercalated between T4·A17 and G5·C16 from the major groove side. The atomic charges of the AFB1-FAPY nucleotide were assigned using MOPAC (27), and are collected in Table 4S and Figure 1S in the Supporting Information. The reference structures were energy-minimized for 500 iterations by the conjugate gradient method to give the starting structures used in MD calculations, FAPY-Bi and FAPY-Ai, respectively. Stereoviews of these are shown in Figure 2S in the Supporting Information. Calculations using DNA starting models generated by INSIGHTII, the three mixing time NOE experiments, and DNA correlation times of 2, 3, 4, and 5 ns yielded 12 sets of distance data. These data were pooled; average values of all minimum and maximum distances were used in setting error bounds to give the experimental NOE restraints used in subsequent molecular dynamics calculations (28). Molecular Dynamics and Simulated Annealing. Potential energy minimization and restrained MD calculations were performed using X-PLOR (v. 2.4) (29) implemented with the CHARMM (30) force field. The empirical energy function (31) consisted of energy terms for bonds, bond angles, torsion angles, tetrahedral and planar geometry, hydrogen bonding, and nonbonded interactions including van der Waals and electrostatic forces. The van der Waals energy term was approximated using the Lennard-Jones potential energy function. The electrostatic term used the Coulomb function, based on a full set of partial charges (-1/residue). A distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4 was applied for all calculations. The nonbonded pair list was updated if any atom moved more than 0.5 Å, and a cutoff distance of 11 Å was used for the nonbonded interactions. The effective energy function was composed of two terms describing distance and dihedral restraints, which were in the form of a square well potential (32). All bond lengths involving hydrogen were kept fixed with the SHAKE algorithm (33) during MD calculations. The integration time step used in the molecular dynamics calculations was 1 fs. Structure coordinates were archived every 0.1 ps. All calculations were performed in Vacuo without explicit counterions. Backcalculation of NMR data was performed using CORMA (34). The refined structure was analyzed using DIALS AND

Thermal denaturing of a freshly prepared sample of the AFB1-FAPY-modified duplex showed biphasic melting. The first transition occurred at 28 °C, and the second at 56 °C. A NOESY experiment performed 24 h after the modified oligodeoxynucleotide was prepared revealed multiple isomeric species. The sharp resonances for both conformations in the NMR spectra obtained shortly after the duplex sample was prepared, and the absence of exchange peaks, indicated that interconversion was slow on the NMR time scale. The initial conformation converted to a more stable form over a period of several days at 4 °C; eventually only the spectrum corresponding to the more stable conformation was observed. The rate of interconversion was not determined. The sample which had undergone conformational conversion for several days at 4 °C exhibited a single melting point at 56.0 °C, 15 °C higher than that of the native oligodeoxynucleotide. This paper describes refinement of the solution structure of the thermally stable conformation. At this juncture, the identity(ies) of the initially formed species remain(s) to be determined. Nonexchangeable DNA Protons. The FAPY lesion interrupted the sequential NOE connectivities of B-form DNA at T4, the nucleotide immediately 5 to the adduct in the modified strand (Figure 1). For FAPYG5, opening of the guanine imidazole ring resulted in the loss of the guanine H8 proton, and the introduction of the FAPYG5 CHO proton, at  8.25 ppm. No sequential NOE was observed between T4 H1 or H2, and FAPYG5 CHO. An intranucleotide NOE was observed between FAPYG5 CHO and FAPYG5 H1. The normal intrastrand NOE connectivities resumed starting from FAPYG5 H1fA6 H8 and continued to the 3-terminus. In the complementary strand, interruption of the sequential NOEs was observed between C16 H1 or H2, and A17 H8. Corresponding interruptions of the sequential NOE connectivities between the base aromatic H6 or H8 protons were also observed. For the modified strand, these connectivities were interrupted at T4 H6, which did not show an NOE to FAPYG5 CHO, and then resumed from A6 H8 onward to the 3-terminus. For the complementary strand, the sequential connectivities were interrupted at C16 H6, which did not show an NOE to A17 H8, and then resumed from A17 H8 to the 3-terminus. At the nucleoside level, FAPY adduct formation was reported to result in rearrangement at the anomeric carbon from the to the R configuration (36). The configuration at C1 was determined by unequivocally identifying the H2 and H2 resonances based upon NOE intensities to H3, and subsequently comparing the intensities of NOEs between H2 and H2 to H1 (Figure 2). The spectral assignments for both the FAPY-modified and unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information. Exchangeable Protons. The imino protons were assigned from NOE connectivities between adjacent base pairs and connectivities to the base-paired amino protons (37). Figure 3 shows NOE conectivities of exchangeable protons for the modified oligonucleotide. An interruption of the sequential imino-to-imino proton NOEs of adjacent base pairs was

found between T4 N3H and FAPYG5 N1H. The strong crosspeaks between FAPYG5 N1H and C16 N4Ha,b indicated that Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding between FAPYG5 and C16 was intact. Complete assignments of the exchangeable protons are listed in Table S3 in the Supporting Information. AFB1-FAPY Protons. The AFB1 H5, H6a, H8, H9, H9a, and -OCH3 resonances were assigned from NOE connectivities (Figure 4). AFB1 H6a and H9a were identified from both COSY and NOESY experiments. H8 and H9 were assigned based on NOEs to H6a or H9a, and between themselves. A strong NOE from AFB1 H5 to AFB1 -OCH3 revealed that that the latter resonance was at  3.52 ppm, while AFB1 H5 was at  5.89 ppm. A new resonance at 8.25 ppm was observed, which was assigned as FAPYG5 CHO. This was suggested by NOEs to FAPYG5 H1, and AFB1 H6a and H8. A HMQC 1H-13C experiment verified a crosspeak between this proton and a carbon atom at  167 ppm, consistent with the formyl moiety. The assignment of the formyl proton was also supported by observing its crosspeak to AFB1 H8 in the TOCSY spectrum. The methylene resonances from the cyclopentenone ring of AFB1 were in the crowded deoxyribose H2, H2 region of the spectrum. NOE cross-peaks from the methylene protons H2R and H3 were weak at all mixing times, possibly due to long relaxation times (38). Table 1 lists the assignments of the AFB1 protons. AFB1-FAPY to DNA NOEs. A total of 31 NOEs from AFB1 protons to DNA protons are listed in Table 2. The protons of the two AFB1-fused furan rings showed NOEs to major groove and imino protons of the DNA; most of these were to the 5-neighboring base-pair T4·A17 (Figure 5). Thus, H6a and H9a, which were located on the same face of the AFB1 moiety, both exhibited NOEs to T4 H6 and CH3. AFB1 H8 and H9 exhibited similar NOEs, although in the case of H9, which was located on the opposite face of the AFB1 moiety from H6a and H9a, the observed NOEs to T4 could be due to spin diffusion. AFB1 H9a showed an NOE to A17

protons. These were primarily to base pair T4·A17, in the 5-direction, and the modified nucleotide FAPYG5. These included NOEs between AFB1 -OCH3 and T4 H1,H2,H2, FAPYG5 H1, FAPYG5 NH , FAPYG5 N1H, and T4 N3H. The 2 cyclopentenone ring HR and H protons exhibited NOEs to the minor groove H1 proton of C16 in the complementary

strand. There were no internucleotide NOEs observed between AFB1 and the 3-neighbor A6·T15 base pair. Chemical Shift Perturbations. The greatest effects were observed for the modified strand (Figure 6). In the major groove, T4 H6 and CH3 shifted downfield 0.15 and 0.3 ppm, respectively. In the minor groove, the deoxyribose protons

H1, H2, and H2 were affected, at nucleotides T4 and FAPYG5, and to a lesser extent, C16. Examination of the exchangeable protons revealed that T4 N3H at the 5-side of FAPYG5 shifted 0.6 ppm downfield. FAPYG5 N1H showed a smaller <0.2 ppm downfield shift. The C16 N4Ha and N4Hb amino protons shifted 0.3 and 0.2 ppm downfield, respectively. A17 N6Ha shifted 0.2 ppm upfield. The amino proton A6 N6Ha, at the 3-side of the adduction site, displayed a 0.62 ppm downfield shift, while A6 N6Hb experienced <0.1 ppm chemical shift perturbation. T7 N3H, two base pairs from the adducted site, experienced a 0.15 ppm downfield shift. With the exception of A6 N6Ha, large chemical shift perturbations were not observed in the 3-direction from the site of the lesion, at A6·T15. Compared with AFB1 (39) and the AFB1-FAPY nucleoside,2 the AFB1 resonances showed upfield shifts in the oligodeoxynucleotide duplex (Table 1). As compared to the

nucleoside, upfield shifts of 0.50 ppm for H5, 0.46 ppm for H6a, 0.65 ppm for H9a, and 0.41 ppm for -OCH3 were observed. The exception was AFB1 CHO which shifted 0.15 ppm downfield. The chemical shifts of the AFB1 protons were also compared to the corresponding AFB1 shifts in two cationic adducts previously examined, d(ATCAFBGAT)·d(ATCGAT) and d(ATAFBGCAT)2 (38). With the exception of AFB1 H5, the remaining AFB1 protons were shifted substantially upfield as compared to the two cationic adducts. NMR Melting Experiments. The thermal melting of the modified duplex was compared to the unmodified duplex by monitoring spectra of the imino protons as a function of temperature (Figure 7). For the modified duplex, at 65 °C, FAPYG5 N1H remained the sharpest signal in the imino region of the spectrum. Three additional broadened imino resonances were also observed at 65 °C, which were assigned as T4 N3H of the 5-neighbor base pair, T15 N3H of the 3neighbor base pair, and T7 N3H. Thus, the presence of the FAPY lesion stabilized 4 base pairs, T4·A17, FAPYG5·C16, A6·T15, and T7·A14, with regard to DNA melting. In contrast,

complete broadening of the imino protons occurred at 50 °C in the unmodified duplex. Distance Restraints. A total of 549 restraints were derived from the NOESY experiments. In addition to the experimental restraints, 23 empirical distances based on hydrogen bonding geometries were applied. The final 572 interproton restraints consisted of 382 intranucleotide restraints, and 190 internucleotide restraints. A total of 26 of the 572 restraints were either intranucleotide or internucleotide AFB1-FAPY to DNA restraints. Figure 8 summarizes the distribution of distance restraints among the nucleotides. The smaller number of distance restraints for some nucleotides, e.g., C9, was generally due to overlapping resonances, preventing accurate measurement of cross-peak intensities. The nucleotides on both 5- and 3-termini yielded fewer internucleotide restraints. Structural Refinement. Superposition of the six MDgenerated structures for the AFB1-FAPY-modified oligodeoxynucleotides from the FAPY-Ai family and the FAPYBi family is shown in Figure 9. The stick model shown in Figure 10 represents the final refined structure obtained by averaging 6 structures of rMD FAPY-Ai and six structures from rMD FAPY-Bi followed by 2000 steps of potential energy minimization using conjugate gradients. The overall structure maintained Watson-Crick base pairing. The AFB1 moiety was intercalated from the major groove between FAPYG5 and T4·A17. Helicoidal analysis (35) revealed that

the intercalated FAPY lesion unwound the modified duplex, and increased the base-step between T4·A17 and FAPYG5·C16 to 7 Å (Figure 11). The adduct-induced unwinding was localized to the adducted base pair FAPYG5·C16 and its 5and 3-neighbor base pairs T4·A17 and A6·T15. The modified duplex was unwound approximately 15° at the adducted site, which was observed in the ribbon representation of the DNA phosphodiester backbone. The structure refinement was evaluated for precision by comparing pairwise root-mean-square deviations (rmsd) of the individual structures to the average structure, tabulated in Table 3. That the final structures converged to a more B-like conformation was evidenced by the large rmsd between IniA and rMDA as compared to the smaller rmsd between IniB and rMDB . The rmsd calculations showed that both the FAPY-Ai and FAPY-Bi sets of calculations converged to common structures, independent of starting structure. Accuracy was evaluated by comparing the sixth root residuals between theoretical NOE intensities calculated for the emergent structures and the NMR data (Table 4). That the modified duplex more closely resembled the B-like starting structure was revealed by the improved R1x factor between the FAPY-Bi starting structure and the emergent average structure, as compared to the R1x factor between the FAPY-Ai starting structure and the emergent average structure. The refined set of structures MD FAPY-Bi starting from FAPY-Bi was slightly more accurate than the set MD FAPY-Ai derived from FAPY-Ai, but both were significantly improved as compared to the starting structures. The major improvement between the starting structures and the final refined structures was observed in the internucleotide NOEs, consistent with the expectation that intercalation and associated unwinding of the duplex perturbed the pattern of NOEs between adjacent base pairs, but not the intranucleotide NOEs. The final R1x value of rMDav of 8.7 × 10-2 suggested that the refined structures were in good agreement with the NOESY data. DISCUSSION Aflatoxin B1, a mycotoxin and a strong environmental mutagen, is of concern due to its frequent contamination of

a variety of economically important agricultural products. Two cationic guanine N7 adducts of AFB1, d(ATCAFBGAT)·d(ATCGAT) and d(ATAFBGCAT)2, intercalated above the 5-face of the modified guanines (38). A cationic guanine N7 adduct of sterigmatocystin intercalated in a similar manner (40). Subsequently, site-specific mutagenesis experiments revealed that the cationic AFB1 adduct induced mutations at the lesion site, and in the 5-direction from the

lesion site, an observation consistent with the structural studies (41). The present structural study was motivated by the general observation that adducts at guanine N7 are susceptible to base-catalyzed conversion to the corresponding imidazole-ring-opened FAPY adducts. In the case of AFB1, the chemical stability of the AFB1-FAPY lesion, and its reported long half-life (17, 18), suggested that it could be a major progenitor of AFB1-induced mutations. Hence, the

structure and mutagenic properties of the AFB1-FAPY adduct are of considerable interest. The AFB1-FAPY Adduct. The approach to this sitespecific FAPY-AFB1 adduct involved reaction of the duplex oligodeoxynucleotide containing a single guanine in the target strand with AFB1 epoxide (11, 20). There were initial concerns that the FAPY adduct would exist as multiple species, complicating both the isolation and subsequent spectroscopy. At the nucleoside level, NMR studies of other FAPY adducts (42, 43) indicated the presence of rotational

isomers about the C5-N5 bond of the pyrimidine moiety. A study of the sterigmatocystin-FAPY adduct at the oligodeoxynucleotide level advanced a similar hypothesis (19). Alternatively, the potential for interconversion between the and R configurations at the anomeric carbon existed (36). Despite these concerns, the previous study of the sterigmatocystin-FAPY adduct at the oligodeoxynucleotide level (19) reported that while a mixture of species initially formed, these subsequently rearranged with a half-life of several days

to a homogeneous sample. It was concluded that for the stable species, the sterigmatocystin chromophore was intercalated 5 to the modifed guanine, with the chromophore spanning the helix. Our work revealed that the AFB1-FAPY adduct behaved similarly, with regard to the rearrangement over a time period of several days to a homogeneous sample, and the general features of the 5-intercalated AFB1 chromophore. Significantly, the present work revealed the extraordinary thermal stability of the AFB1-FAPY lesion in this DNA sequence. The stacking patterns and potential hydrogen bonding interactions which may provide a basis for this unusual thermal stability emerged from a detailed structural study. Structure of the AFB1-FAPY Lesion. Figure 12 shows stacking patterns calculated for the AFB1-FAPY-modified oligomer, as compared to the corresponding unmodified oligomer. The intercalated aflatoxin moiety stacked with the T4 and FAPYG5 pyrimidine rings in the modified strand and partially stacked with C16 and A17 in the complementary strand. This was consistent with the pattern of NOEs in the 5-direction from the AFB1 moiety to base pair T4·A17. As in the cationic adduct (38), NOEs between AFB1 H6a and H9a, located at the juncture of the two furan rings, to T4 H6 and CH3 provided diagnostic markers of the 5-orientation of the aflatoxin moiety. The NOEs from AFB1 H6a, H8, H9, and H9a to major groove protons, from AFB1 -OCH3 to T4 and FAPYG5 deoxyribose protons, in the minor groove, and the cross-strand NOEs from the AFB1 cyclopentenone ring to C16 H1, also in the minor groove, provided strong evidence that AFB1 spanned the helix. The interruptions of sequential NOE connectivities between base pairs T4·A17 and FAPYG5·C16 provided further

support of the notion that the AFB1 moiety was intercalated between these two base pairs. No sequential NOE was observed between T4 H1 or H2, and FAPYG5 CHO. An intranucleotide NOE was observed between FAPYG5 CHO and FAPYG5 H1. The normal intrastrand NOE connectivities resumed starting from FAPYG5 H1fA6 H8 and continued to the 3-terminus. In the complementary strand, interruption of the sequential NOEs was observed between C16 H1 or H2, and A17 H8. Corresponding interruptions of the sequential NOE connectivities between the base aromatic H6 or H8 protons were also observed. For the modified strand, these connectivities were interrupted at T4 H6, which did not show an NOE to FAPYG5 CHO, and then resumed from A6 H8 onward to the 3-terminus. For the complementary strand, the sequential connectivities were interrupted at C16 H6 and H1, which did not show NOEs to A17 H8, and then resumed from A17 H8 to the 3-terminus. An interruption of the sequential imino-to-imino proton NOEs of adjacent base pairs was found between T4 N3H and FAPYG5 N1H. The strong cross-peaks between FAPYG5 N1H and C16 N4Ha,b indicated that Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding between FAPYG5 and C16 was intact. Unusual Stability of the FAPY Lesion. A striking feature of this AFB1-FAPY adduct was the 15 °C increase in Tm for the modified duplex, as compared to the parent duplex. In comparison, the cationic lesions stabilized the d(ATCAFBGAT)·d(ATCGAT) and d(ATAFBGCAT)2 duplexes by 3-5 °C (20, 38), which was attributed to the formation of stacking interactions between the AFB1 moiety and the adjacent base pairs. To our knowledge, with the exception of cross-linking

agents, these aflatoxin adducts are thus far unique in increasing the thermal stability of the DNA duplex. The present structure suggests that stacking interactions are enhanced in the FAPY lesion, since ring opening of the imidazole allows the AFB1 to intercalate approximately parallel to the DNA base pairs, and with minimal helical bending. The AFB1 moiety was approximately parallel to base pairs T4·C17 and FAPYG5·C16, although the refined structures predicted a downward buckling of base pair FAPYG5·C16. The predicted hydrogen bond between the formyl group of the pyrimidine moiety and A6 N6Ha of the base pair A6·T15 provides an additional potential source of thermal stability. The calculated distance between the formyl oxygen and A6 N6 was 2.68 Å, and the calculated angle O···H-N was 130°. Only one resonance signal was observed for FAPYG5 CHO,

which suggested that rotation about the formyl bond was restrained in duplex DNA. The 0.6 ppm downfield shift of A6 N6Ha was consistent with redistribution of the electron density from the formyl oxygen to A6 N6Ha. The NOE observed from the FAPYG5 formyl proton to A6 N6Ha also suggested that the two protons were in proximity. The thermal stability of this FAPY adduct was also evident in the NMR spectra of the Watson-Crick imino resonances as a function of temperature (Figure 7). For the modified duplex, at 65 °C, FAPYG5 N1H remained the sharpest signal in the imino region of the spectrum. Three additional broadened imino resonances were also observed 65 °C, which were assigned as T4 N3H, of the 5-neighbor base pair, T15 N3H, of the 3-neighbor base pair, and T7 N3H. Thus, the presence of the FAPY lesion stabilized 4 base pairs with regard to DNA melting, T4·A17, FAPYG5·C16, A6·T15, and

T7·A14. In contrast, complete broadening of the imino protons occurred at 50 °C in the unmodified duplex. The stabilization of the T7·A14 base pair was surprising, since it is 2 base pairs downstream of the FAPY adduct. The remarkable stabilization of 4 base pairs is believed to result from a combination of enhanced stacking interactions between T4·A17, the AFB1 moiety, and FAPYG5·C16, and on the 3-side of the lesion, from stabilization of base pair A6·T15 by hydrogen bond formation between A6 N6Ha and AFB1 CHO, which holds T7·A14 in place also. This observation correlated with the downfield chemical shift for T7 N3H of 0.15 ppm, which was consistent with stronger hydrogen bonding of the A6·T15 and T7·A14 base pairs. This hydrogen bond suggests that the both the physical properties and the biological processing of the FAPY lesion may depend upon the DNA sequence. Structure-Function Relationships. The biological relevance of this structure remains to be determined. The present results suggest that both this stable form of the FAPY adduct and the initially formed cationic adduct are intercalated into the DNA duplex. On this basis, one might predict the processing of the two lesions would be similar. However, despite apparent similarities in structure, the increased thermal stability and the hydrogen bond formation between FAPYG5 CHO and A6 N6H in the FAPY adduct could result a

in significant differences in lesion processing in ViVo. Furthermore, the positively charged guanine base in the initially formed cationic lesion and the neutral pyrimidine moiety in the FAPY adduct possess differing electronic and hydrogen bonding properties. Of particular interest is the possibility that the cationic adduct may bend the DNA duplex, which perhaps makes it more recognizable to repair enzymes. In E. coli, both the cationic and FAPY-AFB1 lesions were processed similarly by uvrABC (44). In contrast, the FAPY lesion was persistent in rat liver (18), suggesting its greater resistance to repair, and giving basis

Mao et al. on mucAB while those derived from the corresponding apurinic site were dependent upon umuDC. This supported the contention that the trans-8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9hydroxyaflatoxin B1 lesion was responsible for GCfAT transversions. Approximately 13% of the AFB1-induced mutations were targeted at the cytosine 5 to the lesion site. This asymmetry was consistent with NMR data in which the cationic AFB1 moiety was intercalated on the 5-side of the modified guanine. That the initially formed d(CTATFAPYGATTCA)-3·5d(TGAATCATAG)-3 slowly converted to a single species amenable for structural analysis suggested that the structure refined in the present work represents the energetically most stable form of AFB1-FAPY in this duplex. Substantial effort is now being made to identify the species initially present in the d(CTATFAPYGATTCA)-3·5-d(TGAATCATAG)-3 duplex, since the less stable structure might lead to a different biological response than does the structure identified in the present work (48). The term "mutagenic switch" was introduced to describe a potential situation in which one of two adduct conformations was mutagenic and the other not, or two conformations potentially leading to differing mutations (49). In summary, the AFB1 moiety in this AFB1-FAPY adduct intercalates from the major groove above the 5-face of FAPYG5, reminiscent of the 5-intercalation of the corresponding cationic guanine N7 adduct, but with substantially

to the notion that the FAPY lesion may be of greater mutagenic significance. It will be of interest to compare site-specific mutagenesis for the cationic and FAPY adducts. Site-specific mutagenesis on the cationic AFB1 lesion in the sequence context 5d(CAFBGA)-3 (45) revealed the predominant mutation to be GCfTA, consistent with earlier studies (46, 47). The sitespecific approach distinguished GCfAT transversions induced by the cationic lesion from those induced by depurination of the N7 adduct. These transversions were dependent

Formamidopyrimidine Adduct of Aflatoxin B1 increased thermal stability. This stability is attributed to strong stacking interactions, and to a sequence-specific hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of the formyl group and the amino proton of the 3-neighboring adenine. In addition to the chemical stability of this FAPY adduct which may make it an important mutagenic species, increased thermal stability may also contribute to its biological processing.
