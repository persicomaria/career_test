ABSTRACT: Cyclic adenosine 5-monophosphate (cAMP) is an ancient signaling molecule, and in vertebrates, a primary target for cAMP is cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). (Rp)-adenosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphothioate ((Rp)-cAMPS) and its analogues are the only known competitive inhibitors and antagonists for cAMP activation of PKA, while (Sp)-adenosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphothioate ((Sp)cAMPS) functions as an agonist. The crystal structures of a (1-91) deletion mutant of the RIR regulatory subunit of PKA bound to (Rp)-cAMPS and (Sp)-cAMPS were determined at 2.4 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively. While the structures are similar to each other and to the crystal structure of RIR bound to cAMP, differences in the dynamical properties of the protein when (Rp)-cAMPS is bound are apparent. The structures highlight the critical importance of the exocyclic oxygen's interaction with the invariant arginine in the phosphate binding cassette (PBC) and the importance of this interaction for the dynamical properties of the interactions that radiate out from the PBC. The conformations of the phosphate binding cassettes containing two invariant arginine residues (Arg209 on domain A, and Arg333 on domain B) are somewhat different due to the sulfur interacting with this arginine. Furthermore, the B-site ligand together with the entire domain B show significant differences in their overall dynamic properties in the crystal structure of (1-91) RIR complexed with (Rp)-cAMPS phosphothioate analogue ((Rp)-RIR) compared to the cAMP- and (Sp)-cAMPS-bound type I and II regulatory subunits, based on the temperature factors. In all structures, two structural solvent molecules exist within the A-site ligand binding pocket; both mediate water-bridged interactions between the ligand and the protein. No structured waters are in the B-site pocket. Owing to the higher resolution data, the N-terminal segment (109-117) of the RIR subunit can also be traced. This strand forms an intermolecular antiparallel -sheet with the same strand in an adjacent molecule and implies that the RIR subunit can form a weak homodimer even in the absence of its dimerization domain.

to convert an extracellular event into a biological response. Several diseases are associated with unusually high or low levels of cAMP and with disruptions in this cAMP-mediated signaling pathway. In bacteria, cAMP regulates gene expression through binding to a catabolite repressor protein (CAP) (1). In eukaryotic cells, the primary receptors for cAMP are the regulatory subunits (R) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (2, 3). Other mammalian receptors for cAMP that utilize the same cAMP binding motif include the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (4) and the guanine nucleotide exchange protein (EPAC) (5, 6). Despite the presence of other cyclic nucleotide binding proteins, the two major forms of PKA, type I and II, are ubiquitous in mammalian cells and are thought to mediate most known biological effects of cAMP (7, 8). The regulatory subunits of isozymes I and II, referred to as RI and RII, are functionally distinct and are further subclassified into R- and -forms, leading to four distinct R-subunits (RIR,

RIR Subunit Complexed with Rp-cAMPS and Sp-cAMPS RI , RIIR, and RII ), which are the products of separate genes (9). All R-subunits share a similar domain organization, which consists of a dimerization/docking domain at the amino terminus, two tandem cAMP binding domains designated as A and B at the carboxyl terminus, and a variable connecting linker region. The linker region contains a substrate-like inhibitor peptide that binds to the active site of the catalytic subunit (C). The two cAMP binding domains A and B are similar in their primary amino acid sequence (10) but differ with respect to their cAMP analogue selectivity (11) and overall cAMP binding kinetics (3). Several criteria distinguish these two sites. Site A has a preference for N6-substituted cAMP analogues and has a faster offrate for [3H]cAMP, while site B preferentially binds C2- and C8-substituted cAMP analogues and shows a slower offrate (12, 13). Based on kinetic evidence, PKA mutants (1416), and cAMP analogue studies (17), the best model indicates that the RIR site A provides the major contact with the C-subunit, while site B is more accessible in the holoenzyme complex than site A. Since cAMP binding is highly cooperative (18, 19), it is predicted that the binding of cAMP to site B induces a conformational change that makes site A more accessible to cAMP. The subsequent occupation of site A by cAMP causes dissociation of the wild-type holoenzyme. The crystal structures of a (1-91) deletion mutant of RIR (20) and the (1-111) deletion mutant of RII (21) with cAMP complexed to both sites reveal the conserved architecture of the two cAMP-binding sites as well as structural details of key residues involved in cAMP binding. These structures also provide the molecular basis for understanding how cAMP binds cooperatively to isozymes I and II of PKA, thus promoting signaling to different target proteins. The structural analysis indicates that the exocyclic equatorial oxygens of cAMP interact with the guanidinium side chains of an invariant arginine residue at positions 209 (domain A) and 333 (domain B) for the RIR subunit and positions 230 (domain A) and 359 (domain B) for the RII subunit. This invariant arginine is a key feature of the cAMP phosphate binding cassette (PBC). Earlier data based on cAMP analogue mapping studies and site-directed mutagenesis also support and explain the importance of these arginine residues for cAMP binding (15, 16). Until recently, PKA represented a main target protein for the development of cyclic nucleotide analogues that might be prospective drugs or tools for biochemical and pharmacological studies. A cAMP analogue was recently identified that shows specificity for EPAC (22). Over the past four decades, hundreds of cAMP analogues have been synthesized and investigated for their therapeutic potential. These analogues have provided considerable information about specificity requirements for kinase activation and several show high preference for isoform-specific domains (23). However, (Rp)-cAMPS ((Rp)-adenosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphothioate) and its adenine-base modified derivatives are the only known analogues of cAMP that act as competitive inhibitors and antagonists of cAMP-induced activation of PKA. The corresponding diasteriomeric (Sp)-cAMPS analogues (Figure 1) are agonists (24, 25). (Rp)-cAMPS has a single sulfur substitution for the exocyclic equatorial oxygen, whereas the exocyclic axial position of the cyclophosphate ring is substituted in (Sp)-cAMPS. The introduction of sulfur for the exocyclic oxygen results in a substantial

decrease in binding affinity. The affinity determination of a set of doubly modified (Rp)- or (Sp)-analogues shows that (Sp) isomers have a 5-fold lower affinity for site A and a 30-fold lower affinity for site B of the RIR subunit. The mean reduction in affinity for the (Rp) isomers are approximately 400-fold and 200-fold for site A and B, respectively (26). Previous studies have demonstrated that the antagonists bind to both type I and type II holoenzymes but keep the protein in a locked conformation, thus preventing activation of the holoenzymes (27, 28). (Rp)-cAMPS differs from cAMP and (Sp)-cAMPS only in the exocyclic substitution but shows the opposite biological response when bound to the regulatory subunit of PKA. To determine the molecular basis for the antagonistic properties of (Rp)-cAMPS and to establish why the (Rp)-cAMPS phosphothioate analogue can keep the protein in the holoenzyme conformation (H-form), while cAMP and (Sp)-cAMPS dissociate the holoenzyme by switching to the cAMP-bound conformation (B-form), we crystallize (1-91) RIR with (Rp)-cAMPS and (Sp)-cAMPS, respectively. The crystal structures of (1-91) RIR complexed with (Rp)-cAMPS phosphothioate analogue ((Rp)-RIR) and the corresponding (Sp)-cAMPS analogue ((Sp)-RIR) are compared to the structure of (1-91) RIR bound to cAMP (cAMP-RIR). The structures highlight the critical importance of the interaction of the exocyclic oxygen with the invariant arginine in the PBC and the importance of this interaction for the dynamical properties of the allosteric interactions that radiate out from the PBC. MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR proteins. The recombinant (1-91) deletion mutant of RIR was expressed and purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (29). An improvement was achieved by eluting from the cAMP affinity resin with cGMP instead of cAMP. The cGMP-eluted protein behaves like the stripped regulatory

To obtain cAMP-free (1-91) RIR, the purified cGMP-eluted RIR subunits were dialyzed overnight against 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM DTT, and 50 mM MES buffer at pH 7.5. After cGMP was removed, the proteins were concentrated and bound to the cAMP analogues using a 10-fold excess of (Rp)-cAMPS or (Sp)-cAMPS, respectively. The (Rp) and (Sp) analogues were purchased from Sigma. Crystallization and Data Collection. Single crystals of both (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR were grown in hanging drops using the vapor diffusion method by mixing 2 µl of the protein solution (12 mg ml-1) and 2 µl of the reservoir solution (1.0 M NH2SO4, 12.5% glycerol, 10 mM DTT, 0.1 M NaAc buffer, pH 5.5) at 22.5 °C. The crystallization conditions were similar to those used for cAMP-RIR protein (20). The crystals grew to 1.0 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm within a week. The crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6522 (P6122) with cell dimensions of a ) b ) 86.9 Å, c ) 179.0 Å for (Rp)-RIR and a ) b ) 87.4 Å, c ) 178.7 Å for (Sp)RIR with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, respectively. The crystal data are summarized in Table 1. The X-ray diffraction data for (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR crystals were collected initially with a Mar Research Imaging Plate 345 detector system at University of California, San Diego. The crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution. Higher resolution diffraction data (2.4 Å for (Rp)-RIR and 2.3 Å for (Sp)-RIR) were collected on a MAR image plate scanner at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) under cryo conditions at 100 K. Data were processed using DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (30). The data for (Rp)-RIR was 99.3% complete with an Rsym of 4.8% and 99.5% complete with an Rsym of 4.5% for (Sp)-RIR. Data collection statistics are also summarized in Table 1. Structure Refinement. The structure determination and refinement for (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR were carried out using the program package CNS (31) on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. Five percent of the data were randomly selected as the test data set used for cross validation. Model building was performed using the graphics software TURBOFRODO (32). Phases for (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR successively were generated by applying a difference Fourier method based on the crystal structure of cAMP-RIR at 2.8 Å resolution (20), in which two cAMP ligands were omitted. Rigid body refinement was carried out, leading to an R factor of 27.4% at 2.8 Å resolution. The structure was then refined for both

simulated annealing from 2500 °C and individual B-factor for a number of rounds using CNS protocols. During the refinement, the (2Fo - Fc) and (Fo - Fc) electron density maps were regularly calculated and used for manually rebuilding the model. Simulated annealing "omit" maps were calculated as well when necessary. When the resolution was gradually extended up to 2.4 Å, water molecules were gradually fitted into the model. In the late stage, only those water molecules with reasonable temperature factors that hydrogen bonded directly to protein atoms or through other water molecules were included in the final model. The refinement data are summarized in Table 2. RESULTS Structure Determination. To avoid the model bias possibly introduced during the refinement, the structures of (Rp)RIR and (Sp)-RIR successively were solved from the model of cAMP-RIR, respectively, although the refined (Rp)-RIR structure at 2.4 Å resolution seems to be a good initial model for (Sp)-RIR refinement. Although phase solutions were performed using either P6522 or P6122 as the space group for (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR crystals, the R factors and Rfree were significantly lower for a solution in P6522 space group. The final structure of (Rp)-RIR refined at 2.4 Å resolution gave an R factor of 20.9% and Rfree of 25.3%, and refined bond lengths have a root-mean-square deviation of 0.007 Å from ideality, and the bond angles deviate by 1.40°. The R factor and Rfree of the 2.3 Å (Sp)-RIR structure are 21.1% and 24.1%, respectively, while the rms deviations of the bond lengths and bond angles from the ideal values are 0.007 Å and 1.43° (Table 2). Ramachandran plots of the two structures obtained using the program PROCHECK (33) show that all of the nonglycine residues are located in the allowed regions with 82.2% for (Rp)-RIR and 83.5% for (Sp)-RIR in the most favored regions. The final models consist of 268 amino acid residues (109376), two cAMP-analogue molecules and 93 or 103 water atoms for (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR, respectively. The (2Fo - Fc) and (Fo - Fc) electron density of (Rp)-cAMPS and (Sp)-cAMPS analogues in the A-sites are shown in Figure 2, parts a and c, respectively, and indicate the well-defined positions for the two analogues. To help discriminate the (Rp)-cAMPS and (Sp)-cAMPS compared to cAMP, we modeled the electron densities by replacing an oxygen atom into the exocyclic sulfur position in (Rp)-RIR (Figure 2b) and the equatorial sulfur position in the (Sp)-RIR structure (Figure 2d). This revealed extra (Fo - Fc) electron density

at the appropriate position containing the position of the sulfur and confirming also that no cAMP was present. The N-terminal segment 94-108 and the C-terminal residues 377-379 could not be traced owing to the lack of welldefined electron density in the (2Fo - Fc) and (Fo - Fc) maps. However, the N-terminus of the newly refined structures showed significant improvement, compared to the earlier structure of cAMP-RIR. Four additional residues (109-112) and all the side chains of the residues of 113116 could be visualized. A loop region (303-308), located on the molecular surface connecting 4 and 5 of domain

B, had high temperature factors, and only the main chain conformation could be traced. OVerall Structures. The overall structures of (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR are very similar to each other with an rms difference of 0.34 Å for all CR atoms. The overall structures of these two molecules are also similar to that of cAMPbound RIR, as shown in Figure 3. The rms deviations of a total of 264 CR atoms are 0.51 Å between (Rp)-RIR and cAMP-RIR and 0.48 Å between (Sp)-RIR and cAMPRIR molecules. In addition to the N- and C-terminal regions, some slight conformational differences in the backbone can

6624 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 21, 2004 be observed in several loop regions in the (Rp)-RIR, (Sp)RIR, and cAMP-RIR structures. These regions are all solvent-exposed. The most significant change appears at the surface loop region between 4 and 5, residue 303-310 (Figure 3). As mentioned above, only the main chain conformation of this loop can be traced, and the B factors are relatively higher than the other regions, suggesting that this segment is somewhat flexible. Each cAMP-binding domain of the RIR subunit consists of three R-helices and eight -strands, which form a flattened barrel surrounding two cAMP ligands. The secondary structures of (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR are the same as that of cAMP-RIR, especially the helices and the -sheet surrounding the cAMP binding sites. The most notable feature of the (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR structures in terms of their secondary structure relates to their N-terminal segments. After including four more residues (109-112) at the N-terminus in both final structures, this segment, residues (109-117), is found to interact with the same N-terminal segment of a symmetry-related molecule, forming an intermolecular antiparallel -sheet. This -sheet allows two RIR monomers to pack together as an R homodimer. The structural alignment of (Rp)-RIR, (Sp)-RIR, and cAMPRIR show some small main- and side-chain conformational changes in the peptide segments that surround the two invariant arginine residues, Arg209 of domain A and Arg333 of domain B in the phosphate binding cassette, although the secondary and tertiary structures of these cAMP binding pockets are basically identical in the three structures. These changes will be described subsequently in the ligand binding section. There are several solvent-rich regions in the structures of the (Rp) and (Sp) analogues bound to the RIR subunit. Solvent molecules were not included in the original crystal structure of cAMP-RIR due to the lower resolution of the data (20). About 15 crystallographic water atoms, in both (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR, are observed within the A/B domain interfacial crevice, which is formed by helix C and -strand 5 of domain A, and helix A and helix B of domain B, as well as some loop regions between these elements of secondary structure. The cAMP in domain A can be accessed by this solvated interface. The second solvent-rich region locates at a surface patch on domain A consisting of -strands 2, 4, and 5 with 10 water atoms in (Rp)-RIR structure. There are also some water molecules (about 14 in both structures) that cluster on the solvent-exposed surface region of helix B and the N-terminus of helix C in domain A. This region is thought to be the catalytic subunit docking surface. In the (Rp)-RIR structure, most of solvent molecules exist at the interface between domain A and domain B, while more solvent molecules appear in domain B in the (Sp)-RIR structure relative to the (Rp)-RIR structure. The most significant structural water molecule, discussed below, is found at the base of the PBC in domain A where it is anchored by the conserved Arg209. cAMP Analogue Binding Sites. Each cAMP-binding site shows the conserved structural features that are characteristic of this motif, as evidenced by the similarity of each site's hydrogen bonding pattern elucidated from analyses of the (Rp)- and (Sp)-phosphothioate analogues bound to RIR and the cAMP-RIR structures. The phosphate group and the ribose ring both make direct and water-bridged interactions

with the protein through several hydrogen bonds and electrostatic contacts. However, there are no direct hydrogenbonding interactions between the adenine ring and the protein. Most of the interactions with cAMP involve a highly conserved peptide between -strands 6 and 7, which is referred as the "phosphate binding cassette" or PBC (21). The PBC, comprised of residues Gly199-Ala211 in domain A and Gly323-Ala335 in domain B, makes multiple contacts with the phosphate and ribose moieties of cAMP and also with a structural water molecule. Figure 4 shows the PBC motifs of (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR structures superimposed with that of cAMP-RIR. The interaction patterns of all these direct contacts between the ligand and protein are conserved whether the PBC motif is bound to cAMP or to the (Rp)and (Sp)-analogues. However, the strength of some of interactions, as indicated by the bond distance, are significantly different for (Rp)-RIR compared to cAMP-RIR and (Sp)-RIR. For example, the distance between the exocyclic equatorial sulfur (S1P) and the NH1 atom of the invariant residue Arg209 is 2.6 Å in the (Rp)-RIR structure. In

contrast, in cAMP-RIR and (Sp)-RIR where an oxygen atom occupies this equatorial position, the distances between this atom and the same side-chain nitrogen atom of Arg209 are 3.2 and 3.1 Å, respectively. This difference, indicative of a strong versus a weak hygrogen bond, indicates that the interaction between the (Rp)-cAMPS analogue, and the A-site is much tighter at this position, even though the overall affinity of (Rp)-cAMPS is less than for cAMP. Almost every bond distance of direct contact between the PBC motif and the ligand is shorter in (Rp)-RIR than in the cAMP-RIR and (Sp)-RIR structures. This is not true for the B-site of the (Rp)-RIR structure. In fact, the Arg333 in B-site has a shorter bond distances in the (Sp)-RIR. All of the direct or water-bridged interactions between the ligand and protein are summarized in Table 3. Another significant difference of the PBC motif in the (Rp)-, (Sp)-, and cAMP-RIR structures appears on the peptide segments that surround the invariant residues, Arg209/Arg333. Figure 4a shows that the backbone conformations of the fragment from residue 206 to residue 215 in domain A are slightly different in the three structures. The corresponding fragment 328-337 in domain B shows the largest conformational change in these structures, as shown in Figure 4b. The relative positions and orientations of the three ligands are basically the same when (Rp)- and (Sp)-analogues and cAMP are superimposed (Figures 4 and 5). They adopt a syn conformation with the adenine rings pointing toward the solvent-exposed interface.

The adenine rings of the three ligands show very little difference when the structures are superimposed. Two structural water molecules can be observed within the cAMP-binding pocket of domain A in the (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR structures (Figure 5a). Wat701 interacts with the phosphate group of the ligand but also is hydrogen-bonded to the protein by forming contacts to the main chain carboxyl atom of Pro208, to the backbone amide of Ala210, and to the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr207. This water molecule, with a low B-factor of 26 Å2, occupies a highly conserved position when the structures of (Rp)-RIR, (Sp)RIR, (1-111) RII (21), and even the CAP protein (34) are superimposed (Figure 5b). The low resolution of the previous RIR structure did not allow for visualization of solvent molecules. Another water molecule (Wat702) is hydrogen-bonded to the N6 and N7 nitrogen atoms of the adenine ring. Wat702 also interacts with the OG1 atom of Thr190 from 5 of domain A and with the OD2 atom of Asp258 located on helix A of domain B. Thus the A-site cAMP can makes contact with helix A of domain B through this solvent molecule. Asp258, in turn, hydrogen bonds to Arg241, which interacts with the conserved glutamate in the PBC. This residue, Glu200 in domain A, hydrogen bonds to the 3OH of the ribose moiety of cAMP bound to site A. Thus there is an extended network of interactions that link domain B to the cAMP binding site in domain A. A similar water molecule (Wat509) was found in the RII structure, as shown in Figure 5b. These water-mediated contacts are

FIGURE 6: B-factor plots of (Rp)-RIR compared to cAMP-RIR. Comparison of the plots shows that the average B-factors in domain B are higher overall compared to domain A in (Rp)-RIR, while both domain A and domain B have the similar low B-factors in cAMP-RIR. X-axes correspond to the residue numbers, while Y-axes correspond to the B-factor value scale. Domain A contains residues 143-260; domain B contains residues 261-376. The corresponding secondary structural elements for (1-91) RIR are also shown.

FIGURE 5: Solvent molecules in cAMP binding site A. Panel a shows two structural solvent molecules in the A-site pocket of (Rp)RIR. The water atoms are shown in green. The water-bridged hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines. The PBC motif (side chain in red) and ligand (yellow) are also shown. Panel b shows the PBC motif, ligand, and structural water atoms within A-site of (Rp)-RIR superimposed with those of (Sp)-RIR and cAMP-RII .

structures of cAMP-bound RIR and RII (20, 21). The (Sp)RIR structure is similar. A remarkable feature of the (Rp)RIR structure is that the (Rp)-cAMPS ligand in the B-site, together with the entire domain B, appears to be much more dynamic relative to the A-site ligand and domain A. The plot of the B-factors in the refined (Rp)-RIR structure is shown in Figure 6. All peaks with high temperature factors can be attributed to loop regions located on the molecular surface. For example, the first peak corresponds to the surface loop (residues 135-143) connecting helix XN and helix A. Figure 6 also shows that domain B is probably more flexible than domain A as indicated by the higher B-factors. This difference between domain A and domain B is not seen for the (Sp)-RIR structure or for cAMP-RIR or cAMP-RII . The B-factor value of the A-site ligand is 34 Å2 with a mean value of 47 Å2 for the domain A (residues 143-260) in the (Rp)-RIR structure, while those of the B-site ligand and the domain B (261-376) are 65 and 63 Å2, respectively. DISCUSSION There are two stable conformational states in vivo for the regulatory subunit of PKA: the dissociated cAMP-bound conformation (B-form), where cAMP occupies all four binding sites of the R dimer, and the cAMP-free holoenzyme conformation (H-form), where the cAMP-free protein forms an inactive holoenzyme complex by binding to the C-subunit.

summarized in Table 3, section b. There are no structural solvent molecules found in the cAMP binding pocket of domain B. Flexibility of Domain B. The regulatory subunits of PKA contain two tandem homologous cAMP binding domains, A and B. When occupied by cAMP, both domain A and domain B show similar stability, as indicated by their relatively similar and low B-factor values from the crystal

FIGURE 7: Crystal packing of (1-91) RIR subunit. Two symmetry-related molecules form an intermolecular -sheet by the N-terminal segment (109-117).

The allosteric binding of cAMP induces the R-subunit to shift from the H-form to the B-form. The molecular architectures of the cAMP bound conformations for RIR and RII have been described on the basis of their crystal structures. Many biochemical lines of evidence, including the recent crystal structure of cAMP-free domain B of RIR (35) and H/D exchange studies coupled with mass spectrometry (36), indicate that the R-subunit undergoes a conformational change when it binds to the C-subunit. Surprisingly, major conformational changes do not appear to occur in the cAMP binding pocket, suggesting that the H-form and the B-form of the R-subunit do not display different global conformations. On the basis of the recent structure solution of a complex of C-subunit with domain A of RIR (Kim et al., unpublished results), domain A does assume a novel conformation when C is bound. These studies do, however, identify a general allosteric pathway for communication between the PBC and the C binding surface involving helices A and B. On the basis of the increased dynamic properties described here, when (Rp)cAMPS is bound the protein most likely cannot utilize the allosteric pathways that link cAMP binding to the release of C-subunit. The two events are uncoupled in the presence of (Rp)-cAMPS. The (Rp)-cAMPS phosphothioate analogue functions as an antagonist, while cAMP and the (Sp)-cAMPS analogue cause the complex to dissociate when all binding sites are occupied. It was still in question whether the (Rp)-cAMPS binding would be sufficient to stabilize a different conformation (Hform) of the R-subunit even in the absence of the C-subunit, based on previous studies (27). Here the crystal structures of RIR complexed with (Rp)-cAMPS and (Sp)-cAMPS phosphothioate analogues, as well as the reported cAMPRIR structure, show a similar overall molecular architecture (Figure 3). The largest rms deviation among the three structures is only 0.51 Å. These structures also share the same secondary structure patterns. The local conformations of the cAMP binding pockets are also similar, although some small changes occur in the segments around the two invariant arginine residues. These observations demonstrate that the RIR subunit exists in a cAMP-bound conformation even when bound to the cAMP antagonist, (Rp)-cAMPS, even though the increased dynamics suggests that ensembles will

be present when (Rp)-cAMPS is bound. In the absence of C-subunit, (Rp)-cAMPS phosphothioate analogue is not sufficient to cause the R-subunit to switch from one conformation to the other. The contact features of each cAMP binding site are similar to each other in (Rp)-RIR, (Sp)-RIR and cAMP-RIR structures. The phosphate group and the ribose ring are buried within the center of the -barrel and make direct contacts with several highly conserved or invariant amino acid residues, as summarized in Table 3. When the (Rp)-cAMPS analogue occupies both binding sites in domains A and B, it makes a tighter interaction within the A-site than cAMP and the (Sp)-cAMPS analogue. For example, the bond distance between the equatorial sulfur atom (S1P) of (Rp)cAMPS and the Arg209 side chain NE1 atom is shorter (2.6 Å) relative to the 3.2 Å on cAMP-RIR and 3.1 Å on (Sp)RIR structures. Chemical studies indicate that the negative charge will reside on the sulfur in the (Rp)- or (Sp)-cAMPS phosphothioate analogues, while there will be significant resonance of electrons between the two exocyclic oxygens in cAMP (27). Obviously, the electrostatic contact between this negatively charged sulfur and the positively charged guanidinium side chain of Arg209 enhances the bond strength, behaving as a salt bond. There are weak hydrogen bonds between the equatorial oxygen and the Arg209 side chain in the cAMP-RIR and (Sp)-RIR structures. Surprisingly, the (Rp)-cAMPS analogue does not show this strong hydrogen bond in the B-site. The peptides around Arg209 in site A and Arg333 in site B show some conformational changes when the PBC motifs bound to the cAMP analogues are compared (Figure 4a,b). The fragment around Arg209 (residues 206-215) shows a slight difference, while the fragment 328-337 in site B shows a larger conformational change. It suggests that these peptide fragments will undergo conformational changes when binding to the cAMP analogues, especially on domain B. Numerous solvent molecules can be observed within the A/B domain interfacial crevice, as mentioned above. This solvent-molecule network can access cAMP bound to site A. Two water molecules, Wat701 and Wat702 are located in the cAMP-binding pocket of domain A and form an extensive H-bond network with both ligand and the protein (Table 3, section b) in the (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR structures.

6628 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 21, 2004 The Wat701-bridged H-bond network, which is close to the phosphate group, might effect the interaction between the cAMP ligand and the protein, helping to stabilize the ligand binding and also the water itself. Wat702 locates in the rim of the cAMP binding pocket of domain A. Through this water molecule, the cAMP adenine ring can make contact with both domain A and domain B of the RIR subunit. The B-factor plot (Figure 6) indicates that the (Rp)-cAMPS analogue in B-site, together with the domain B, is significantly more flexible relative to A-site ligand and the domain A in the (Rp)-RIR structure. However, cAMP and (Sp)cAMPS binding do not induce a similar flexibility of B-site ligand and domain B, as evidenced by analysis of the B-factor values of (Sp)-RIR, cAMP-RIR, and also the cAMP-bound RII structures. This flexibility of domain B in the (Rp)RIR structure can thus be attributed to the (Rp)-cAMPS binding to the protein. Many previous studies have indicated that the A-site is masked in the holoenzyme so that cAMP binds first to B-site of each regulatory monomer. This triggers a conformational change in the B-site, which serves as a "signal" that allows cAMP to bind to the A-site, then causing holoenzyme dissociation (18). An electrostatic network between the A-site and the B-site can be traced on the basis of the crystal structure of the RIR subunit. Initially, the B-site ligand interacts with Arg333. This invariant arginine forms a hydrogen bond with Glu289. Lys347, Glu270, Arg352, Lys240, Asp267, Arg241, and Glu200 then constitute a charge relay pathway leading from site B to site A where Glu200 binds directly to the ribose ring of cAMP bound to the A-site. This network of interactions, mostly electrostatic, is likely to be essential for the cooperative communication between domain A and domain B. In the case of the (Rp)cAMPS analogue, it is the negatively charged sulfur that makes contact with Arg333. On the basis of the above discussions, some conformational changes within each cAMP binding site, together with the flexibility of the B-site ligand and domain B, provide a possible interpretation for why the (Rp)-cAMPS phosphothioate analogue functions as a competitive antagonist of cAMP. These differences most likely block the allosteric "signal" that allows domain B to communicate with domain A, thereby preventing the dissociation of holoenzyme. When (Rp)-cAMPS is bound, domain B can no longer effectively communicate with domain A. This communication network between the two domains is disrupted. This must be mediated primarily by an electrostatic effect where (Rp)-cAMPS is significantly different from cAMP. Owing to the higher resolution X-ray data for (Rp)-RIR and (Sp)-RIR crystals, four more amino acid residues are included in the N-terminus of the newly refined structures. The N-terminal fragment (109-117) interacts with the same segment of a symmetry-related molecule, making an intermolecular antiparallel -sheet, which forms an R homodimer by packing two monomers together (Figure 7). The crystal structure of an Apo A-domain mutant of RIR (residues 94244) also demonstrates that the N-terminal segment shares the same packing pattern to form an intermolecular -sheet, although the overall crystal packing is different (Akamine et al., unpublished results). It may imply that the (1-91) deletion mutant of RIR can form a homodimer by its N-terminal linker region even without the dimerization domain. ACKNOWLEDGMENT
