Glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase (GSAM) is the second enzyme in the C5 pathway of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis found in most bacteria, in archaea and in plants. It catalyzes the transamination of glutamate-1-semialdehyde to 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in a pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate (PLP)-dependent manner. We present the crystal structure of GSAM from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elonga° tus (GSAMTel) in its PLP-bound form at 2.85 A resolution. GSAMTel is a symmetric homodimer, whereas GSAM from Synechococcus (GSAMSyn) has been described as asymmetric. The symmetry of GSAMTel thus challenges the previously proposed negative cooperativity between monomers of this enzyme. Furthermore, GSAMTel reveals an extensive flexible region at the interface of the proposed complex of GSAM with glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR), the preceding enzyme in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Compared to GSAMSyn, the monomers of GSAMTel are rotated away from each other along the dimerization interface by 108. The associated flexibility of GSAM may be essential for complex formation with GluTR to occur. Unexpectedly, we find that GSAM is structurally related to 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), the ALA-producing enzyme in the Shemin pathway of aproteobacteria and non-plant eukaryotes. This structural relationship applies also to the corresponding subfamilies of PLP-dependent enzymes. We thus propose that the CoA-subfamily (including ALAS) and the aminotransferase subfamily II (including GSAM) are evolutionarily closely related and that ALAS may thus have evolved from GSAM.

Introduction
The structural core of all tetrapyrroles, including essential cofactors such as heme, chlorophyll and vitamin B12, is assembled from eight molecules of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the first common precursor of all tetrapyrroles. ALA was initially

found to be synthesized from glycine and succinylcoenzyme A by 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS, EC 2.3.1.37) as part of the Shemin pathway.1,2 Much later the enzyme ALAS was found to be restricted to a-proteobacteria and non-plant eukaryotes. All other bacteria, archaea and plants produce ALA through the C5 pathway using tRNA-bound glutamate as substrate.3,4 The activated glutamate is first reduced to glutamate-1semialdehyde (GSA) by the NADPH-dependent glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR, EC 1.2.1.70),5 and GSA is then rearranged to ALA by glutamate1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase (GSAM; EC 5.4.3.8).6 As animals and humans lack these enzymes, they are potential targets for herbicides and antibacterial agents. GSAM, a homodimer, is a member of the a-family of pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate (PLP)-dependent

Figure 1. A scheme of the reaction catalyzed by GSAM. Glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA) is converted to 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) via the intermediate 4,5-diaminovalerate. During the first half of the reaction pyridoxamine 5 0 -phosphate (PMP) is converted to pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate (PLP), PMP is regenerated in the second half of the reaction. An alternative mechanism (dotted arrows) proceeds via the intermediate 4,5-dioxovalerate (gray). Here, PLP is converted to PMP and regenerated upon ALA formation.

enzymes.7 Although it functions as a mutase, catalyzing the exchange of amino and oxo groups in GSA, GSAM is structurally8 and mechanistically 6,9,10 an aminotransferase. One proposed reaction mechanism requires the cofactor to be present initially as pyridoxamine 5 0 -phosphate (PMP).9,10 Transfer of the amino group to atom C5 of GSA produces the intermediate 4,5-diaminovalerate and PLP (Figure 1), while abstraction of the C4 amino group finally yields ALA and regenerates PMP. An alternative mechanism starts with the PLP form of the enzyme and proceeds via a PMP-bound enzyme and 4,5-dioxovalerate as intermediate.6 All GSAM enzymes were found to be capable of catalyzing both reactions; however, kinetic studies indicate a preference for the first described mechanism.9,10 GSA, a highly reactive a-amino aldehyde, has a half-life of w3 min under physiological conditions.11 Based on the crystal structures of GluTR from Methanopyrus kandleri12 and GSAM from Synechococcus (GSAMSyn),8 we have proposed that both dimeric enzymes form a complex allowing GSA to channel directly from GluTR to GSAM, ensuring efficient synthesis of ALA and minimizing the loss of this unstable intermediate.12 We and others have confirmed the existence of this complex for the enzymes from Escherichia coli13 and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, respectively.14 Here, we present the crystal structure of GSAM from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (GSAMTel) in its ° PLP-bound form at 2.85 A resolution. In contrast to the asymmetric homodimer from Synechococcus (GSAMSyn), GSAMTel is perfectly symmetric. An extensive flexible region covering the active site is located at the proposed binding interface with GluTR. Based on the unexpected structural similarity of GSAMTel to 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), we propose an evolutionary relationship between the ALA-generating enzymes of the independent C5 and Shemin pathways.

Results
Overall structure GSAM from the thermophilic cyanobacterium T. elongatus (GSAMTel) was cloned, produced, purified and crystallized as described in Materials and Methods. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of GSAM from Synechococcus GSAMSyn (PDB-code ° 2GSA)8 and refined to a resolution of 2.85 A. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. In agreement with previous studies,15 dynamic light-scattering and analytical gel-filtration confirm GSAMTel to be a structural dimer. Crystal packing analyses indicate only one GSAMTel monomer (415 residues) per asymmetric unit. Two crystallographically related monomers thus constitute a symmetric homodimer for GSAM Tel unlike the asymmetric GSAMSyn dimer.8 Each GSAM monomer consists of three domains (Figure 2(a)): a small N-terminal domain (residues 1­48) encompassing a three-stranded, antiparallel b-sheet; a catalytic domain (residues 49­304) dominated by a seven-stranded b-sheet (b-strand order 3245671, where only strand 7 is antiparallel) flanked on either side by a-helices; and a C-terminal domain (residues 305­411) including a threestranded antiparallel b-sheet and four a-helices. The symmetrically positioned active sites, identified by the bound cofactor PLP, are located at the dimer interface. ° A root-mean-square deviation of 0.7 A for 360 a common C atoms underscores the similarity (77% sequence identity) of GSAM Tel and GSAMSyn.8 The topology of GSAM is, furthermore, clearly related to that of other members of the AT II subfamily of PLP-dependent enzymes such as 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase16 and dialkylglycine decarboxylase.17

participate in PLP-binding24 are disordered in GSAMTel (see below). Loops covering the active sites are flexible in the GSAMTel dimer Discontinuous electron density for three mutually adjacent loops (residues 1­18, 132­159 and 278­282) indicates that they are disordered in the GSAMTel crystal. Excluding these loops from the refined structure results in a deep cleft at the dimer interface exposing both active sites (Figure 2(c)). One of the loops (132­159) was similarly found to be disordered in subunit B of GSAMSyn (153­181), while it is ordered in subunit A. In addition, the disordered 18 N-terminal residues of GSAMTel correspond to residues 30­42 of GSAMSyn, observed to adopt different backbone conformations in subunits A and B.8 Val31 and Arg32 of GSAMSyn delimit the substrate-binding pocket. Arg32, an invariant residue in GSAM from all species, presumably binds the carboxylate group of the substrate GSA.8 Quaternary structures of GSAMTel and GSAMSyn differ The r.m.s. deviation between GSAMTel and GSAMSyn monomers following their superimpo° sition is 0.7 A (see above). The corresponding value ° for the dimers is 2.1 A. This noticeably larger value for the dimer is caused by an "opening" of the GSAMTel dimer relative to GSAMSyn by about 108 (Figure 2(d)). While the separation and mutual orientation of a-helices a2 and a2* (* for the second monomer), located near the 2-fold dimer axis, are quite similar in both proteins, adjoining regions are progressively further apart in moving away from the fulcrum positioned near a2 and a2*. The largest ° difference, 6 A, between GSAMTel and GSAMSyn is observed for residues located in helices a5 and a5*.

Cofactor binding UV-visible absorption spectroscopy of GSAMTel indicates that the cofactor is lost during purification. Although both PMP and PLP had been added to the protein in sufficient amounts to allow saturation of the active site before crystallization, only PLP is observed within the active site. PLP is linked covalently to the catalytic residue Lys251 constituting the "internal aldimine" (Figure 2(b)). Correspondingly, the pyridinium ring of PLP adopts an orientation characteristic for lysinebound PLP. Bound PMP, in contrast, is usually tilted by 20­308, moving the amino group away from the catalytic lysine residue, as observed in the PMP-containing subunit of GSAMSyn and aspartate aminotransferase.18 The phosphate group of PLP is recognized via hydrogen bonds to Gly101 N, Thr102 N, Thr102 Og and to a water molecule. The pyridinium ring of PLP is sandwiched between Val225 and Tyr128 in such a way that the phenoxy ring of Tyr128 is almost perpendicular to the pyridinium ring (Figure 2(b)), a distinctive feature of GSAM and closely related aminotransferases.16,19 A salt-bridge to atom Od2 of Asp223, an invariant residue in all aminotransferases,20,21 ensures that PLP-N1 remains protonated, strengthening the electron-withdrawing capacity of the cofactor.22,23 Residues from the second monomer that normally

Discussion
GSAM is an unusually flexible aminotransferase GSAMTel is a symmetric, PLP-binding dimer with equally disordered regions in both subunits. In the asymmetric GSAMSyn the PLP-binding monomer B has a similarly disordered lid,25 while the lid is closed and well-ordered in PMP-binding monomer A.8 This observation of PLP in combination with a disordered or "open" lid is unexpected, as the catalyzed reaction for GSAMSyn is believed to be initiated by PMP (Figure 1),9,10 while the closed, PMP-bound state would interfere both with substrate uptake and product release. In the PLPbound form, corresponding to a reaction intermediate, GSAMSyn adopts an "open" conformation, allowing for the potential loss of the productintermediate 4,5-diaminovalerate arresting the enzyme in its PLP form. Monomers were suggested

to show negative cooperativity,8 ensuring that one monomer remains in the closed and PMP-bound conformation while the other is open and binds PLP. The symmetric GSAMTel, however, challenges the proposed negative cooperativity, as both monomers can clearly adopt the same state simultaneously. This is supported by the observation that GSAMTel PLP exclusively binds, despite PMP and PLP having been added. PLP may have a higher binding affinity than PMP because of Schiff base formation, whereas PMP does not bind covalently. This finding supports an alternative mechanism suggested for GSAM, in which catalysis starts with the enzyme in its PLP form abstracting the amino group of GSA and yielding 4,5-dioxovalerate as the intermediate product (Figure 1).6 Only crystals of intermediate or inhibitor complexes, or further spectroscopic data would allow the true mechanism to be established. The asymmetry of GSAMSyn, the symmetry of the closely related GSAMTel, and the open conformation of the latter, indicate that uncomplexed GSAM is unusually flexible compared to other PLP-dependent enzymes.

The flexible region is located in the putative GluTR-binding interface In a proposed model of a GluTR/GSAM complex, we placed GSAMSyn8 into the V-shaped GluTR-dimer from M. kandleri12 inter alia to allow for substrate channeling between the two enzymes of the C5 pathway.13,14 Replacing GSAMSyn by GSAMTel in this model results in the flexible lids of GSAMTel being positioned at the interface with GluTR (Figure 3) opposite the "back door" of GluTR.12 GluTR would therefore potentially stabilize the flexible loops of GSAM and establish a substrate channel that enables efficient transfer of the reactive intermediate GSA between the active sites of both enzymes. Complex formation of GSAM with GluTR may also prevent loss of the proposed reaction intermediate 4,5-diaminovalerate, as is observed to a significant extent in in vitro analyses of isolated GSAM.26 The open conformation of GSAMTel allows it to be accommodated within the V-shaped GluTR with less steric hindrance than GSAMSyn, implying that the flexibility of GSAM is a necessary feature for

complex formation. Instead of acting as a lid to the active site, the flexible regions of GSAM would facilitate complex formation with GluTR, creating the connecting substrate channel in the process. Structural homology of GSAM and ALAS We recently reported the crystal structure of 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) from Rhodobacter capsulatus (Figure 4(a)).27 ALAS, like GSAM, produces ALA. It utilizes the substrates glycine and succinyl coenzyme A rather than glutamate 1-semialdehyde (GSA). This route constitutes the Shemin pathway of ALA synthesis found in non-plant eukaryotes and a-proteobacteria. Mechanistically, ALAS belongs to the CoA subfamily of the a family of PLP-dependent enzymes,7 and is hence structurally closely related to 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase28 and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (AONS),29 two members of this subfamily (Table 2). Despite a level of sequence identity of only 18%, GSAM is the next closest structural neighbor of ALAS (Figure 4(b)). This is unexpected, as GSAM belongs to the subfamily AT II of the afamily, proposed to be only distantly related to the CoA subfamily.7 The overall structural similarity of GSAM and ALAS includes the substrate-binding pockets, where these enzymes share a conserved arginine residue required for substrate binding (Arg21 in ALAS, Arg10 in GSAMTel, Arg32 in GSAMSyn). Differences are restricted to the active sites and substrate channels, and include a significantly shorter loop near the active site compared to the long, flexible lid in GSAM (residues 132­159).8,25 As a result, ALAS possesses a distinct active site channel and a hydrophobic binding pocket for the 3 0 -phosphate ADP moiety of succinyl-CoA.

The N-terminal stretches (residues 1­23 in ALAS and 1­18 in GSAM) also deviate significantly. In ALAS, an a-helix wraps around the second subunit stabilizing the interface, while in GSAM helix a1 folds back onto the same subunit.8 CoA and AT II subfamilies of PLP-dependent enzymes are evolutionary neighbors PLP-dependent enzymes of four structurally unrelated families have been identified.30 Elaborate evolutionary pedigrees for each family have been proposed on the basis of family profile analysis and protein structure.7 Within the a-family, CoA-utilizing enzymes constitute the CoA subfamily and were found to be most closely related to the g subfamily and more distantly to subfamilies AT I, AT IV and DC I (Figure 4(c)).7 The AT II subfamily, of which GSAM is a member, was found to be more distantly related to the CoA subfamily. The high level of structural similarity between ALAS (CoA subfamily) and GSAM (AT II subfamily) implies a close evolutionary relationship that does not fit the above classification. Strikingly, both enzymes synthesize the identical product as part of the two alternative pathways initiating tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Structural comparison analyses (DALI Z-scores, Table 2) indicate that enzymes of the CoA subfamily are, in fact, more similar to AT II enzymes than to members of subfamilies g, AT I or DC I (Figures 4(d)­(f)). Structural analysis of AONS (CoA subfamily) identified dialkylglycine decarboxylase, an AT IIenzyme, as the closest structural and possibly evolutionary neighbor.29 Later, 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase (AT II) was found to be structurally similar to AONS (CoA), the preceding

enzyme in biotin biosynthesis,21 again indicating a close evolutionary relationship.31 All members of both subfamilies share a unique three-stranded b-meander in the N-terminal domain21 that is not present in enzymes of the other subfamilies. In summary, we suggest that within the classification of PLP-dependent enzymes by Mehta & Christen,7 the CoA subfamily needs to be re-assigned to the branch of the evolutionary tree accommodating subfamily AT II (Figure 4(c)). ALAS evolved from GSAM ALAS and GSAM, enzymes of two related, yet independent pathways, synthesize the same product. As part of the Shemin pathway, ALAS is highly conserved between a-proteobacteria as well as unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. 32 GSAM as part of the C5 pathway is found in all

plants, archaea and eubacteria, except a-proteobacteria. As a presumed remnant of the RNA world,33 the glutamyl-tRNA substrate of GluTR, the first enzyme of the C5 pathway, indicates this pathway to be particularly ancient. Succinyl coenzyme A, appearing late in the evolution of the Krebs cycle34 (itself younger than the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles35) would be much younger. The C5 pathway (including GSAM) must hence be significantly older than the Shemin pathway (ALAS). Assuming that the C5 pathway evolved into the latter would require the conversion of GSAM into ALAS but would eliminate the enzyme GluTR of the C5 pathway. It would furthermore decouple heme biosynthesis from protein biosynthesis, making heme biosynthesis dependent on the metabolically more central Krebs cycle instead. Only after the evolution of the Shemin pathway will an a-proteobacterium have given rise to the

Materials and Methods
Cloning, production and purification of GSAM The gene for GSAM (hemL) of T. elongatus strain BP-1 was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the NcoI/BamHI sites of the E. coli expression vector pETM30 to produce a C-terminal GST-fusion protein. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus cells (Stratagene), cultivated in LB medium containing 30 mg/ml of kanamycin at 37 8C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6. The temperature was lowered to 20 8C, protein production induced by 100 mM isopropyl-b-Dthiogalactopyranoside and cells cultivated for 20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by French press and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 4 8C. GSAMTel-GST was isolated from the soluble fraction by glutathione Sepharose affinity chromatography and cleaved enzymatically with TEV protease. GSAMTel was purified by anion-exchange (MonoQ HR 10/10, Amersham Biosciences) and gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 26/60, Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 20 centrifugal concentrator (Vivascience). The yield was w25 mg of pure protein per 1 l of bacterial culture. Protein integrity and purity were verified using SDS-PAGE, N-terminal protein sequencing, dynamic light-scattering and mass spectrometry. Crystallization GSAM was crystallized by the hanging-drop, vapordiffusion method at 4 8C: 3 ml of protein (containing 1 mM PMP and 1 mM PLP) was added to 3 ml of reservoir solution (100 mM Pipes (pH 6.5), 200 mM magnesium sulfate and 17% (w/v) PEG 3350). Crystals grew to a size of 400 mm!150 mm!150 mm within three weeks. Prior to X-ray data collection, 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol was

X-ray diffraction data were collected using a RU-H3R rotating anode X-ray generator and an R-axisCC IV detector (MSC-Rigaku). Data were processed and scaled using the XDS program package.39 GSAMSyn (PDB code 2GSA, monomer A)8 was used as a model for molecular replacement in EPMR.40 Rigid body and simulated annealing refinement was performed using CNS,41 while REFMAC5, including TLS refinement protocols,42 was used for subsequent refinement. Coot was used for manual model building and structural analysis,43 WHAT IF44 and PROCHECK45 for structure validation, and PyMOL for molecular depictions. LSQKAB of the CCP4 program suite46 was used for structural superimpositions, CLUSTAL W47 for sequence alignments, and DALI48 for structure-based sequence alignments.
