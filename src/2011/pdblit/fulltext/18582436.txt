Abstract Bisphenol A (BPA) has been acknowledged as an estrogenic chemical able to interact with human estrogen receptors (ER). Many lines of evidence reveal that BPA has an impact as an endocrine disruptor even at low doses. However, its binding to ER and hormonal activity is extremely weak, making the intrinsic significance of low dose effects obscure. We thus supposed that BPA might interact with nuclear receptor(s) other than ER. Here we show that BPA strongly binds to human estrogen-related receptor (ERR ), an orphan receptor and one of 48 human nuclear receptors. In a binding assay using [3 H]4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) as a tracer, BPA exhibited a definite dose-dependent receptor binding curve with the IC50 value of 13.1 nM. 4-Nonylphenol and diethylstilbestrol were considerably weaker (5­50-fold less than BPA). When examined in the reporter gene assay for ERR using HeLa cells, BPA completely preserved ERR 's high constitutive activity. Notably, BPA exhibited a distinct antagonist action to reverse the inverse agonist activity of 4-OHT, retaining high basal activity. ERR is expressed in a tissue-restricted manner, for example very strongly in the mammalian brain during development, and in the adult in the brain, lung and other tissues. It will now be important to evaluate whether BPA's hitherto reported low dose effects may be mediated through ERR . © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bisphenol A (BPA1 ), 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane, has a symmetrical chemical structure of HOC6 H4 -C(CH3 )2 -C6 H4 -OH. BPA, with a worldwide production of approximately 3.2 million t per year, is used mainly in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. It has been long acknowledged to be an estrogenic chemical able to interact with human estrogen receptors (ER) (Dodds and Lawson, 1938; Krishnan et al., 1993; Olea et al., 1996), and recently to act as an antagonist for a human androgen receptor (AR) (Sohoni

and Sumpter, 1998; Xu et al., 2005). Both ER and AR belong to the group III steroid hormone receptors, a subfamily of 48 human nuclear receptors (NRs) (Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature Committee, 1999; RobinsonRechavi et al., 2001). Various so-called "low dose effects" of BPA have recently been reported in vivo for reproductive organ tissues and systems in mice and rats. For instance, very low dose levels of BPA were shown to have an increase in size and weight of the fetal mouse prostate (Nagel et al., 1997; Gupta, 2000), and a decrease in daily sperm production and fertility in male mice (Gupta, 2000; vom Saal et al., 1998). All of these low dose effects of BPA have been explained as the output effects of steroid hormone receptors (Welshons et al., 2003). It should be noted, however, that BPA's binding to ER and AR and hormonal activity is extremely weak, 1000­10,000 times lower than for natural hormones, making the intrinsic significance of low dose effects intangible and obscure (National Toxicology Program, 2001; Safe et al., 2002; Gray et al., 2004; vom Saal and Hughes, 2005). This discrepancy on low dose effects prompted us to enquire whether BPA may interact with NRs other than ER and AR. The estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) are a subfamily of orphan NRs closely related to ERs, ER and ER (Gigu` re, 2002; Horard and Vanacker, 2003). There are e three ERR family members, ERR , ERR and ERR , with ERR the most recently identified third member (Eudy et al., 1998; Hong et al., 1999). ERRs and ERs show a considerable level of amino acid sequence similarity and identity in both their DNA-binding (DBD) and ligand-binding (LBD) domains. Although 17 -estradiol (E2), a natural ligand of ERs, does not bind to any of the ERR family, ERRs can bind to functional estrogen response elements (EREs) in ER target genes, suggesting a possible overlap between ERR and ER action (Huppunen and Aarnisalo, 2004). ERRs also bind to ERR-response element (ERRE), but as monomers. ERRs are all orphan receptors, while efforts to discover synthetic compounds that might modify the activities of the ERRs have identified only a few chemicals that suppress ERRs' spontaneous transcriptional activities. For instance, diethylstilbestrol (DES) was found to repress the molecular activities of ERRs (Tremblay et al., 2001; Coward et al., 2001), although DES is considerably weaker in inhibiting ERR activities compared with its action as an ER-activator. 4-Hydoroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) has also been identified as an inverse agonist of ERR , deactivating the receptor by decreasing the very high level of spontaneous constitutive activity (Coward et al., 2001). From evidence in a receptor binding assay in which [3 H]4-OHT was used as a tritium-labeled recep-

tor tracer (Coward et al., 2001), 4-OHT binds strongly to ERR . Collectively, these results reveal that E2, DES and 4-OHT all bind to ERs very strongly, but that their binding abilities to ERR vary. When we compared the chemical structures of these ligands, it became clear that they share only the phenol group usually acknowledged as a key structural element for receptor recognition (Fig. 1). Since BPA in a compact minimum-energy conformation also shares this phenol group, we assumed that BPA is a potent binder to ERR . In the present study, we first established the competitive receptor-binding assay using [3 H]4-OHT as a tracer. The reported binding assay (Coward et al., 2001) utilized glutathione-coated beads to cargo GSTERR -LBD, namely ERR -LBD fused to glutathione Stransferase (GST), for B/F separation of the tracer [3 H]4OHT. Instead of expensive glutathione-coated beads, we used 1% dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) to absorb and remove receptor-free [3 H]4-OHT. This worked successfully, and we eventually could demonstrate that BPA binds strongly to ERR . This initial result has led us further to detailed examination of BPA in the reporter gene assay for ERR , and here we report that BPA retains extremely high ERR 's constitutive activity.

Preparation of receptor protein GST-fused ERR -LBD ERR -LBD was amplified from a human kidney cDNA library (Clontech Labolatories, Mountain View, CA, USA) by PCR using gene-specific primers and cloned into pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). GST-fused receptor protein expressed in E. coli BL21 was purified on an affinity column of Glutathione-Sepharose 4B to obtain GST-ERR LBD. 2.3. Radio-ligand binding assays for saturation binding Saturation binding assay was conducted essentially as reported (Nakai et al., 1999) at 4  C using [3 H]4-OHT (3.15 TBq/mmol as methiodide, America Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) and GST-ERR -LBD (1 g) with or without 4-OHT (10 M final concentration). Free radio-ligand was removed by centrifugation or filtration after incubation with 1% dextran-coated charcoal (Sigma). Specific binding of [3 H]4-OHT was calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding from the total binding. 2.4. Radio-ligand binding assays for competitive binding BPA and other chemicals were dissolved in 0.3% DMSO in 0.2% -globulins (a blocker of non-specific adsorption to the reaction vessels). These chemicals were examined for their ability to inhibit the binding of [3 H]4-OHT (5 nM in final) to GST-ERR -LBD (26 ng). Reaction mixtures were incubated overnight at 4  C and free radio-ligand was removed with 1% dextran-coated charcoal by either centrifugation or filtration. The IC50 values were calculated from the dose­response curves assessed by the non-linear analysis program ALLFIT (De Lean et al., 1978). Each assay was performed in duplicate and repeated at least five times. For other nuclear receptors, the binding assays were carried out essentially as outlined above by using a combination of specific radio-ligands and receptor preparations: [3 H]E2 (5.74 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) for ER (prepared by us as GST-fused ER LBD protein) and ER (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), [3 H]DHT (4.48 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for AR (Invitro-

gen), [3 H]cortisol (2.90 TBq/mmol, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Wellesley, MA) for GR (Invitrogen), and [3 H]progesterone (3.48 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for PR (Invitrogen). 2.5. Luciferase reporter gene assay Full-length ERR cDNA was amplified by nested PCR using gene-specific primers and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. To generate the ERR response element (ERRE)-luciferase construct, oligonucleotides (5 CCGGACCTCAAGGTCACGTTCGGACCTCAAGGTCACGTTCGGACCTCAAGGTCAGGATCCA-3 ), and (5 -GATCTGGATCCTGACCTTGAGGTCCGAACGTGACCTTGAGAACGTGACCTTGAGGTCCGGGTAC-3 ) were annealed and ligated into (BglII, KpnI)-digested pGL3-Luc (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate three copies of ERRE. Both the ERR expression (pcDNA3/ERR, 1 g) and luciferase reporter (pGL3/3 × ERRE, 3 g) plasmid were transiently transfected in HeLa cells with 10 l/ml of Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) and 15 l/ml of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), which was exposed to various concentrations of test chemicals to detect agonist/antagonist activity. Luciferase assay reagent (Promega) with the cell culture lysis reagent and the substrate solution was used to measure the luciferase enzyme activity on a microplate reader (Wallac 1420 ARVOsx, Perkin-Elmer, Turku, Finland). Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated at least five times.

3. Results 3.1. Saturation binding [3 H]4-OHT to ERR For the present study, we first attempted to establish a routine radio-labeled receptor binding assay. As mentioned earlier, instead of expensive glutathione-coated beads carrying GST-ERR -LBD (Coward et al., 2001), we utilized 1% dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) to absorb and remove receptor-free [3 H]4-OHT. We used this B/F separation method successfully for [3 H]E2 and the estrogen receptor (Nakai et al., 1999). In the present study, B/F separation of the tracer [3 H]4-OHT also worked successfully and effectively with 1% DCC. As shown in Fig. 2a, specific binding of [3 H]4-OHT to ERR was estimated to be approximately 75%, which is about twice larger than reported value (Coward et al., 2001). It should be noted that non-specific binding of [3 H]4-OHT is significantly low as compared with the procedure to use glutathione-coated beads. A Scatchard plot analysis (Fig. 2b) showed a single binding mode with a binding affinity constant (Kd ) of 10.0 nM and a receptor density (Bmax ) of 6.32 nmol/mg. These data are almost compatible with those reported for the glutathione-coated bead assay.

The graphs show representative dose-dependent binding curves, which give the IC50 value closest to the mean IC50 from at least five independent assays. IC50 values showed a between-experiment coefficient of variation of 5­12%.

3.2. Binding ability of BPA and other chemicals to ERR In the competitive receptor binding assay for ERR (10 g/ml), 4-OHT displaced [3 H]4-OHT (2.5 nM in final) in a clear dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2c). The ability of 4-OHT was calculated with an IC50 value of 10.3 nM, while DES exhibited IC50 = 54.3 nM (Table 1). Surprisingly, in the assay to screen a series of candidate compounds of endocrine disruptors, BPA was found to displace [3 H]4-OHT very strongly with an IC50 value of 13.1 nM. As shown in Fig. 2c, BPA exhibited a distinct dose-dependent sigmoidal binding curve. BPA and 4-OHT bind to ERR equally strongly. This unexpected result was confirmed repeatedly and substantiated by two independent assay systems. In the first, each competition reaction of a dilution series was carried out in a micro-tube, and the following B/F separation with 1% DCC was performed by centrifugation for all micro-tubes. Alternatively, in a second assay system, dilutions were delivered into the wells of a

96-well polypropylene plate. In this method DCC mixtures were transferred to the 96-well plate with a PVDF membrane filter (0.45 m pore size) for direct vacuum filtration using a specific system (Millipore). In both

assay systems it was eventually demonstrated that BPA is highly potent binder to ERR . Two more individuals further validated these results in a carefully followed protocol. Another representative endocrine disrupter candidate 4-nonylphenol was also examined for its specific binding to ERR . It was moderately active, with IC50 = 194 nM (Table 1), about 15 times less potent than BPA. The natural estrogens, E2 and estriol (E3) were by contrast inactive, showing no binding affinity up to a concentration of 10 M (Fig. 2c). Only estrone (E1) was weakly active (549 nM). All other natural ligands of steroid hormone receptors were inactive (Table 1). These included dihydrotestosterone and testosterone for AR, cortisone for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and progesterone for the progesterone receptor (PR). Almost no binding was detected up to a concentration of 10 M. 3.3. Receptor binding specificity and selectivity of BPA and other chemicals We next examined BPA for its ability to bind to other group III nuclear receptors, particularly the steroid hormone receptors ER , ER , AR, GR, and PR. Table 2 summarizes the binding affinities of E2, 4-OHT and BPA to illustrate their receptor specificity and selectivity. When compared with BPA and 4-OHT, which are almost equally potent binders to ERR , these additional candidates were almost completely inactive for AR, GR, and PR. For ER and ER , 4-OHT is highly potent as reported previously by others, with an IC50 value of approximately 1 nM (Kuiper et al., 1998; Fang et al., 2001). In contrast, BPA is very weak for ER (IC50 = 1040 nM) and ER (1320 nM). Collectively, BPA is as potent as 4-OHT for ERR , but much less potent than 4-OHT for both estrogen receptors ER and ER (Table 2, Fig. 3).

The reason for this discrepancy in receptor selectivity between BPA and 4-OHT probably results from differences in their three-dimensional structures. The lowest-energy conformations of the two compounds differ considerably from each other. Thus, although BPA and 4-OHT are almost equally potent as ERR ligands, these data strongly suggest that they occupy different ligand binding subsites of the ERR . 3.4. Different effects of BPA and 4-OHT on ERR constitutive activity in the reporter gene assay We next examined the reporter gene activity of BPA in HeLa cells transiently co-transfected with an ERR expression plasmid and an ERRE-luciferase reporter plasmid. ERR exhibited significantly elevated constitutive activity to yield a reporter enzyme luciferase. Detailed assay results are shown in Fig. 3. Comparing ERR with ER , the constitutive activity levels were considerably different, the basal activity of ERR being about 25 times larger than that of ER (Fig. 3a and b). 4OHT is definitely an antagonist of ER as shown Fig. 3a; 10 M 4-OHT completely suppressed the full agonist activity of 10 nM E2. By contrast, 4-OHT deactivated ERR , as reported (Coward et al., 2001), diminishing the basal activity of ERR up to 70% at a concentration of 10 M (Fig. 3b). This suppression effect of 4-OHT on the constitutive activity of ERR has been acknowledged as an inverse agonist activity. BPA, on the other hand, showed no effect on the basal constitutive activity of ERR even at its concentration of 10 M (Fig. 3b), completely preserving ERR 's high constitutive activity. This BPA action was clearly confirmed in the assay in which 4-OHT exhibited a distinct dose-dependent activity as an inverse agonist (Fig. 3c). It seemed that BPA has no effect on ERR , exhibiting neither enhanced agonist activity nor inverse agonist

Comparison of constitutive activities of ER and ERR in the same cell preparations (1.0 × 105 HeLa cells/well) with the luciferase-reporter plasmid (pGL3/3 × ERRE or ERE). (a) For ER , activities by a single or combination exposure to compounds, for which 10 nM E2, 10 M 4-OHT and 10 M BPA are shown. These include the control basal constitutive activity (E2, 4-OHT, BPA; ---), agonist activity of 10 nM E2 (+--) and its inhibitory action on 10 M 4-OHT (++-). No reaction is elicited by 4-OHT alone (-+-), while very weak agonist activity is elicited by 10 M BPA (--+). At the saturated condition with 10 nM E2, 10 M BPA showed no effect (+-+). (b) For ERR , the compounds used are 10 M E2, 10 M 4-OHT and 10 M BPA. Control basal constitutive activity (---) of ERR is 20­30 times larger than that of ER (in Fig. 3a). This high constitutive activity is sharply reversed by 10 M 4-OHT (-+-), while 10 M BPA (--+) shows no effect on basal constitutive activity. On the other hand, 10 M BPA reversed almost 80% of the inverse agonist activity of 10 M 4-OHT (-++). No such suppression activity was shown by 10 M E2 (++-). E2 itself (+--) exhibited no reaction on ERR .

activity, whereas at ER , it showed extremely weak agonist activity (Fig. 3a). When an ERE-luciferase reporter plasmid was used in place of a plasmid with ERRE element, BPA exhibited exactly the same activity profile as shown in Fig. 3c, totally retaining ERR 's high basal activity (Fig. 3d). In contrast, 4-OHT exhibited definitely enhanced inverse agonist activity in this assay (IC50 = ca. 0.5 M, about 20 times enhanced as compared to that in the assay with ERR -ERRE) (Fig. 3c and d). However, it is very puzzling why 4-OHT has such a strong binding affinity for ERR in vitro (10 nM IC50 ) but has such a low potency in the transient transfection assays (IC50 in the range of around micromolar concentration). This problem has been extensively discussed by Coward et al. (2001). The activity change observed by the replacement of receptor response elements strongly suggests

that the cell-based assays are not still optimized for ERR . 3.5. Inhibitory effect of BPA on the inverse agonist activity of 4-OHT Since BPA strongly binds to the ERR receptor (Fig. 2c), our results from the reporter gene assay suggest that BPA simply occupies the ligand binding site of ERR , causing it to retain its basal constitutive activity. We thus assumed that BPA would inhibit the binding of 4-OHT. To examine this possibility, we first examined the inhibitory activity of BPA against the deactivating activity of 4-OHT. As shown in Fig. 4a, 4-OHT's inverse activity was clearly suppressed in the presence of either 1 M or 10 M BPA. Thus, 10 M BPA strongly inhibited the 4-OHT activities, reversing them by about 85% at

The basal constitutive activity of ERR was evaluated in a cell preparation (1.0 × 105 HeLa cells/well) with the luciferase-reporter plasmid (pGL3/3 × ERRE). (a) Concentration-dependent luciferase-reporter activities of 4-OHT are shown by fold activation in the absence and presence of BPA. 1 M ( ) and 10 M ( ) BPA clearly reverse the inverse activity of solo 4-OHT ( ) against the constitutive activity of ERR .

each test concentration of 4-OHT. 1 M BPA was found to reverse by about 65% (Fig. 4a). As shown in Fig. 4b, BPA completely reversed the inverse activity (about 40% to ERR 's constitutive activity) of 1 M 4-OHT in a dose-dependent manner up to a concentration of 10 M. Against 10 M 4-OHT, BPA also exhibited a clear ability to reverse its inverse activity. These relationships are shown as a three-dimensional plot, expressing the opposing effectiveness of BPA and 4OHT on the basal constitutive activity of ERR (Fig. 4c): 4-OHT is an inverse agonist, whereas BPA is its antagonist. All these results clearly demonstrate that BPA binds to ERR to preserve its native constitutive activity. When the ERE-luciferase reporter plasmid was used instead of the ERRE-luciferase reporter plasmid, similar results were also obtained for a series of reporter gene assays. 4. Discussion ERR , unlike ER , shows extremely high constitutive activity in the reporter gene assay (Fig. 3b). At present, neither the target gene of ERR 's constitutive transcriptional activity, nor its natural ligand are known. If ERR were to possess an agonistic natural ligand, 4-OHT could act as an antagonist of that natural ligand, and BPA as an antagonist. If the endogenous ligand were to function as a natural inverse agonist, 4-OHT would be interpretable as an analogue of such an agonist. In that case, BPA might also act as an antagonist of such a putative natural inverse agonist ligand. However, as suggested by its very high constitutive activity, if ERR were an orphan receptor lacking an identified natural ligand, what then is the significance of BPA's action on this

orphan receptor? 4-OHT is simply an inverse agonist that deactivates ERR 's high transcriptional activity. The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ERR contains a conserved coactivator-binding surface that interacts with coactivators (Darimont et al., 1998), but only when the bound-agonist form positions the activation function (AF)-2 helix, namely helix 12 of the receptor, to bind the coactivator. The LBD structure of ERR has now been solved (Greschik et al., 2002), and as expected from its very high constitutive activity, helix 12 is folded in this active conformation. Most recently, Greschik et al. (2004) reported the three-dimensional structure of the 4OHT/ERR -LBD complex, in which helix 12 is widely separated from the position in the active conformation. This repositioning of helix 12 by 4-OHT deactivates ERR because the receptor becomes unable to recruit coactivator proteins at the appropriate position. It is important that ERR -LBD comprises a wellformed pocket (Greschik et al., 2002). Unlike 4-OHT, BPA is apparently allowed to bind to this pocket without changing the positioning of helix 12. Maintaining helix 12 in an active conformation would then result in preservation of high receptor constitutive activity. Thus, BPA acts just as a space filler with no detectable influence on the ERR receptor conformation, and preventing 4-OHT from inserting into the pocket. This BPA binding might influence, for example, the rate of turnover or metabolism of ERR , perhaps resulting in prolonged transcriptional activities. As described above, BPA would be its antagonist if an endogenous ligand were to act as a natural inverse agonist. Since it is unlikely that ERR has an endogenous agonist ligand (Greschik et al., 2002), BPA might act as an "agonist"

Fig. 5. Schematic flow diagram of cell-specific responses originated by binding of chemicals to nuclear receptors followed by their specific activities against the target genes. ER 's natural ligand E2 and synthetic chemical 4-OHT both bind to ER , and the resulting ER dimer binds the EREcontaining target genes to activate it with a coactivator. BPA and 4-OHT both bind to the ERR monomer, which in turn binds the ERRE-containing target genes. The ER dimer may interact with ERRE-containing genes, and the ERR monomer would bind to ERE-containing genes as either a homodimer or heterodimer, for example with ER .

that works to retain or lock the ERR 's high transcriptional activity, keeping hold of the helix 12 in an active conformation. Based on these consequences and including the present results, Fig. 5 depicts putative interrelationships between these exogenous chemical ligands and their receptors together with the corresponding target genes. Both E2 and 4-OHT bind to ER , inducing different interactions with the ERE-containing genes. Both 4OHT and BPA also bind to ERR , eliciting a different set of interactions with the ERRE-containing genes. As a result, 4-OHT may bind to both ER and ERR , although the corresponding 4-OHT-ERR and 4-OHTER complexes do not stimulate the transcription of genes. In contrast to this non-selective action of 4-OHT, BPA interacts mainly with ERR , and the resulting BPAERR complex interacts with the ERRE DNA binding element and activates the transcription of genes. This activation is not stimulated more than ERR 's basal constitutive activity. The BPA-ERR complex can also interact with the ERE DNA binding element as a dimer. Given that BPA-ERR binds DNA together with E2-ER via ERE, the resulting heterodimers would interfere or cooperate with each other to regulate the overall estrogenic response in a given cell type. Such potential functional

cross-talk between the ERR and ER systems might explain some of BPA's "estrogenic" activities. Receptor selectivity and specificity of the compounds are both strongly related to the structure of the compounds, especially to their three-dimensional structure. It is clear that the structures of BPA, E2 and 4-OHT share simply the phenol group that is generally known as a key structure for receptor recognition (Fig. 1). When we compared structural features other than the phenol group, it became clear that these compounds possess subtle structural differences in phenol benzene-hydrogen (H) substitutions. In each of the structures, both the ortho positions and at least one meta position of the phenolichydroxy group are unhindered, beyond the minimal substitution of benzene-H atoms. The para positions, on the other hand, are blocked or crowded with bulky substitutions that do not share shape, lipophilicity or hydrogen bonding positioning. E2 would be planar, while BPA is not in a planar configuration because of the presence of the sp3 carbon atom at the para position. These features suggest that the receptor fit is likely to arise primarily from the phenolic function, with minimal interference from substitutions at the ortho and at least one meta position. Thus, substitutes at the meta and para positions appear to affect the receptor selectivity between

ER and ERR . More detailed structural consideration will need to be made, perhaps with exploration of the 3D-structure of the BPA­ERR complex, and such a structural analysis is under way in our laboratory. The pattern of human ERR expression is significant. For example, it expresses during the development and differentiation of the fetal brain at very high levels in a tissue-restricted manner (Hong et al., 1999; Heard et al., 2000; Lorke et al., 2000). Although the function of ERR is not yet clarified, various low dose effects of BPA have recently been reported in vivo for reproductive organ tissues and systems in mice and rats as mentioned earlier (Nagel et al., 1997; vom Saal et al., 1998; Gupta, 2000; Welshons et al., 2003). In addition, Markey et al. (2001) have shown that in utero exposure to low doses of BPA alters the development and tissue organization of the mouse mammary gland. There is also evidence for low dose effects of BPA on sexual differentiation of the brain and behavior in rats (Kubo et al., 2003). Kawai et al. (2003) have recently reported that male mice exposed to BPA during fetal development show a high aggression score at 8 weeks of age. This change in aggressive behavior was seen in male offspring of pregnant females fed BPA at 2 ng/g or 20 ng/g weight, both within the range of current human exposure. Palanza et al. (2002) also noted alterations in maternal behavior in mice exposed to a low dose of BPA during fetal life or in adulthood. Many other low dose effects of BPA have been reported extensively in recent years, including the advanced onset of female puberty (Howdeshell et al., 1999) and insulin resistance (Alonso-Magdalena et al., 2006) (see review article (vom Saal and Hughes, 2005) for others). By contrast, studies that deny such lowdose effects of BPA have also been repeatedly reported (Ashby et al., 1999; Cagen et al., 1999), and thus the issue of low dose effects has become controversial (Kaiser, 2000). There is also a hypothesis that some estrogenic compounds can be stored in lipid-rich body tissues so that the toxins accumulate over time and eventually reach concentrations that can activate ER. These are to be reviewed also for ERR and/or other nuclear receptors, but in case such a bioaccumulation may facilitate greatly the specific interaction of chemicals, for example, of BPA with ERR . It is noteworthy that the IC50 value (13.1 nM) of BPA in the receptor binding assay for ERR corresponds to about 3.0 ppb, 1/1000 the concentration (3 mg/kg, or 3 ppm) specifically established as the limit for food. In this climate of uncertainty, it seems essential to evaluate what is a physiological significance of BPA's binding to ERR and whether ERR may be involved in the low dose effects of BPA.

Among a series of steroid hormone receptors including ERs (ER and ER ), AR, GR and PR, BPA was found to be highly selective and specific for ERR (Table 2). Its receptor selectivity for ERR versus ERs is estimated to be approximately 80­100-fold. Although we initially assumed that BPA might interact with nuclear receptor(s) other than ER, BPA's high receptor selectivity together with its high specificity was quite unexpected. In the present study, we succeeded in establishing a receptor binding assay system for ERR . However, to attain specific binding against ERR was extremely difficult even with [3 H]4-OHT, probably because 4-OHT is not a natural ligand of ERR . This is also true for ERR and ERR , and in particular no binding of [3 H]4-OHT was reported for ERR (Coward et al., 2001). It should be also noted that BPA elicits a unique combination of reactions in the reporter gene assay, an unchanged high transcriptional activity and suppression of 4-OHT's inverse agonist activity, as we show in the present study. Notwithstanding the difficulties in our assay, it is now crucial to expand the risk assessment of endocrine disruptor candidate compounds to all nuclear receptors, and more importantly to evaluate whether BPA's previously reported low dose effects are mediated through ERR and its specific target genes. Also, what is a physiological significance of BPA's binding to ERR is critically important issue. Although we could not provide any evidences for this query in the present study, the binding of BPA to ERR has potential and intrinsic importance. To evaluate its physiological relevance may require the examinations to test the abnormality and/or disorder of ERR 's ordinary but unknown functions by means of sophisticated and well-designed assays. We are going to perform such examination and corroboration due to their fundamental importance on human and animal health. Acknowledgements We thank Prof. Ian A.
