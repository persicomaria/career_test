Computational protein design procedures were applied to the redesign of the entire sequence of a 51 amino acid residue protein, Drosophila melanogaster engrailed homeodomain. Various sequence optimization algorithms were compared and two resulting designed sequences were experimentally evaluated. The two sequences differ by 11 mutations and share 22% and 24% sequence identity with the wild-type protein. Both computationally designed proteins were considerably more stable than the naturally occurring protein, with midpoints of thermal denaturation greater than 99 °C. The solution structure was determined for one of the two sequences using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, and the structure was found to closely match the original design template scaffold.

The process of redesigning protein sequences using computational algorithms and physical energy functions has emerged as a powerful tool for protein engineering. New enzyme catalysts, high-affinity biosensors, thermostable proteins, and specific protein­protein interactions have been designed computationally. 1­3 However, because procedures and energy functions used for computational protein design are both new and relatively untested, experimental evaluation continues to be crucial for improving the performance of design procedures. We have performed redesigns of the entire amino acid sequence of an all-helical protein, Drosophila melanogaster engrailed homeodomain. Full-sequence design provides a rigorous challenge for computational methods because it requires energy functions adapted to simultaneous

2 modeling of residues in dramatically different environments ranging from the solvent-exposed protein surface to the hydrophobic core. In addition, full-sequence designs involve vast combinatorial complexity. The engrailed homeodomain designs described here required optimization from among 10111 possible combinations of sidechain identity and conformation. The complexity of these calculations rendered them intractable by exact search methods based on the dead-end elimination (DEE) theorem.4,5 Thus, these designs employed stochastic search methods that can provide solutions for difficult optimization problems but are not guaranteed to identify the most favorable solution for a given problem. To date, structural validation has been carried out for only a small number of proteins arising from simultaneous full-sequence computational design.6­9 These prior studies include fixed-backbone fullsequence designs of 28, 70, and 96 amino acid residues,6,8,9 as well as a full-sequence design of 93 amino acid residues that incorporated main-chain conformational flexibility.7 We report experimental characterization of two proteins designed using different stochastic search methods as well as a

solution NMR structure of the design with the lowest simulation energy. The NMR ensemble closely resembles the design scaffold structure, indicating that the designed protein occupies the target fold. Full-sequence designs are significantly more stable than the natural protein Two sequences were designed in calculations that differed only in the side-chain optimization method used. Protein Data Bank entry 1enh was used as the backbone template for design.10 All residues were assigned to a fixed binary pattern based on solventexposed surface area as described.11,12 The amino acids Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, and Trp were allowed in buried positions, while the polar amino acids Ala, Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, His, Lys, Ser, Thr, and Arg were considered in solvent-exposed positions. The amino acid identities of positions involved in helix capping and helix dipole interactions (4­6, 16, 17, 22­24, 31, 32, 36­38, 49, and 50) were further restricted to statistically likely helix-capping residues as described.13 A backbone-dependent rotamer library14 was employed and a standard energy func-

tion was used that included van der Waals, electrostatics, solvation, and hydrogen bonding terms.15­17 Various side-chain optimization procedures were tested. Monte Carlo with simulated annealing, implemented as previously described,18 yielded a best solution with a simulation energy of -223.4 kcal/mol. This sequence, referred to as UMC herein, is a 40-fold mutant of the wild-type (Figure 1(a)). A lowerenergy sequence, UVF, was identified independently by both the FASTER19 method alone and a combination of a rotamer preprocessing step 20 and the HERO5 exact search method. UVF had a simulation energy of -225.0 kcal/mol and is a 39-fold mutant of the wild-type sequence (Figure 1(a)). No lowerenergy sequence has been found by any method. The two sequences, UMC and UVF, differ by 11 mutations and have 22% and 24% sequence identity with the starting scaffold, respectively. A BLAST21 search indicated that the two variants have no statistically significant similarity to any other known sequences, in contrast with previous structurally validated fullsequence redesigns8,9 which are readily identified as relatives of their structural templates. Genes encoding the two variants were constructed with recursive PCR22 and cloned into a modified pET-11 vector (Novagen). Proteins were overproduced with IPTG induction in BL21(DE3) host cells (Stratagene) and isolated using a freeze/thaw method.23 Purification was accomplished through reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a linear acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.1% TFA. The 52-mer for each variant (with intact N-terminal methionine) was isolated and verified by mass spectrometry. Far ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of UVF and UMC showed similar spectra characteristic of well-folded -helical proteins (Figure 1(b)). One-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy performed on both proteins yielded the sharp, dispersed peaks expected of well-folded proteins (Figure 1(c)). Thermal denaturations monitored by CD at 222 nm revealed that neither variant completes its unfolding transition by 99 °C. In comparison, the wild-type protein has a Tm of 49 °C under the same conditions.13 Unfolding free energies (Gunfold) were measured by chemical denaturation with guanidinium hydrochloride, monitored by CD at 222 nm. Denaturation profiles are available as Supplementary Data Figures 1 and 2. Both variants were 2.3 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type protein at 25 °C under similar conditions (Table 1).24 Solution NMR structure shows the expected homeodomain fold We have reported elsewhere on an X-ray crystal structure of UMC.26 Curiously, the crystal structure obtained for that design clearly showed continuous helices packed in tetrameric helical bundles rather than the expected engrailed fold. The unusual crystallization conditions used, including 25% dioxane, were found to impart both increased helicity and

All data were collected with protein in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) unless otherwise noted. Gunfold was calculated from guanidinium hydrochloride denaturation experiments performed at 25 °C. CD data were collected on an Aviv 62DS spectrometer equipped with a thermoelectric unit and an autotitrator. Thermal denaturation experiments were performed in a 1 mm pathlength cell with 50 M protein and monitored at 222 nm. Data were collected every 1 deg. C with an equilibration time of 2 min and an averaging time of 30 s. Guanidinium chloride denaturations were performed with a 1 cm pathlength cell with 5 M protein and monitored at 222 nm. Protein concentration was kept constant by titration of a saturated guanidinium chloride solution that included 5 M protein. A mixing time of 10 min and 100 s averaging time were used. Values of Gunfold were obtained with the linear extrapolation method.25 a Data from Mayor et al.24 (performed at pH 5.8 at 25 °C using urea denaturation). b Data from Marshall et al.13 (measured in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.5). c Slope of Gunfold versus denaturant concentration.

increased molecular weight as observed by CD and analytical ultracentrifugation measurements.26 This suggests that the crystallization conditions may have led to stabilization of an alternative conformation of the designed protein. In contrast, we report here that the solution NMR structure of the UVF design does match the expected target engrailed fold. All NMR spectroscopy was performed at 20 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer, using UVF protein concentrations of 0.8­1.0 mM in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5), 95% H2O/5% 2H2O, unless otherwise noted. The spectra display considerable chemical shift degeneracy due to the helical structure and relatively low sequence diversity of UVF (Figure 1(a)). Thus, it was necessary to record both HNCACB/CBCA(CO) NH and HNCO/HN(CA)CO experiment pairs on uniformly 15N, 13C-labeled protein samples in order to sequentially assign backbone atom chemical shifts. 2D DQF-COSY and 3D C(CO)NH-TOCSY, 15 N-TOCSY-HSQC and HCCH-TOCSY spectra were then used to assign aliphatic side-chain atom chemical shifts. Aromatic resonances were assigned from 2D DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra and from 2D 13C-CT-HSQC, (HB)CB(CGCD)HD and (HB)CB (CGCDCE)HE spectra (recorded on protein samples dissolved in 100% deuterated buffer). This suite of experiments27 permitted nearly complete assignment of backbone and side-chain chemical shifts. Distance restraints were derived from two 3D 13CNOESY-HSQC spectra (aliphatic and aromatic), a 3D 15 N-NOESY-HSQC spectrum and a 2D 1 H NOESY spectrum. 27 All NOESY spectra were acquired with a 75 ms mixing time. A standard 3D HNHA experiment was recorded in order to extract 3 JHNHA coupling constants.27 These were used, in

4 combination with TALOS28 analysis of chemical shifts, in the selection of dihedral angle restraints. Where TALOS and coupling constant analyses were consistent, both  and  restraints were included. Where TALOS failed to make a prediction, an experimentally determined  restraint was included if warranted by the coupling constant. Error bounds on dihedral restraints were set to ±30°. A set of 586 manually assigned NOE-derived distance restraints and 57 dihedral angle restraints were used as initial input for ARIA1.2.29 ARIA identified 659 additional NOESY cross-peaks, for a total of 953 unambiguous and 292 ambiguous distance restraints. In all, over 1300 individual restraints (interproton distances from NOEs, dihedral angles, and hydrogen bonds) were derived from NMR data (Table 2). At this stage, separate ARIA calculations were carried out fixing the methyl group stereochemistry of each V or L residue in the sequence in turn to obtain stereospecific assignments. In each case, one choice of assignments yielded an ensemble of structures with lower energies, lower 1 (and 2 for L residues) circular order parameters, and fewer NOE restraint violations than the alternate choice. Finally, hydrogen bond restraints were included in the calculation if warranted based on H/D exchange. In these experiments, decreases in peak intensities were monitored by 1H-15N-HSQC spectra following suspension of protiated 15N-labeled protein in deuterated buffer.27

Protection factors were calculated from the ratio of intrinsic rates for a random coil model of the primary structure (kint) to the experimental rates (kobs).30 Hydrogen bonds were judged to be present, and restraints included, if the amide proton had a hydrogen exchange protection factor  1000 and if the residue was in a helix. Nineteen residues were thus restrained (1.3 Å b dNH-O b 2.5 Å and 2.3 Å b dN-O b 3.5 Å). Of 100 structures generated in a final ARIA calculation that included all of these restraints, 43 had no NOE restraint violations N 0.5 Å and no dihedral angle restraint violations N 5°. This subset was analyzed with MOLMOL31 and PROCHECK,32 and is shown in Figure 2(a).

5 rates for protein folding.34 Computational protein design emphasizes local interactions in the absence of evolutionary constraints, so high stability and rapid folding could be a natural consequence of the design process for this system. The solution structure reported here provides important evidence that the observed kinetics and thermodynamics of folding pertaining to the expected fold. However, our experiences with the variant conformation of the UMC protein suggest that increased folding specificity may be an important area for improvement in full-sequence protein design.

stereochemical quality, with 96.6% of residues in most-favored or allowed regions of ,  space. The ensemble shows that UVF adopts the expected homeodomain fold. Helices 1 and 2 are well defined, as are the tight turn between helices 2 and 3 and the first two turns of helix 3. The termini and residues 18­20 in the loop between helices 1 and 2 are poorly localized. While the origin of imprecision in loop residues is not clear, intermediate 3JHNHA coupling constant values for residues 1­5, 46, and 48­51 suggest that the termini are disordered. Disorder in the backbone in these portions of the sequence is accompanied by sidechain disorder as indicated by low 1 and 2 angular order parameters for core residues Trp4, Phe44, Phe45, and Phe48. Compared to the template homeodomain crystal structure, the mean ensemble structure has a backbone r.m.s. difference (r.m.s.d.) of 2.7 Å for residues 3­45 (Figure 2(b)). This degree of difference from the starting structure is somewhat larger than the 1­2 Å r.m.s.d. values seen with previous structurally characterized designed proteins. 6­9 The largest differences from the template crystal structure were found at the termini and in the orientation of helix 3 with respect to helices 1 and 2. Indeed, solution structures of homeodomains uncomplexed to DNA frequently show disorder in both the N terminus and the C-terminal portion of helix 3.33 In addition, the crystal structure used as a template for computational design was reported to have poor electron density and higher temperature factors in the C-terminal region.10 Thus, it is not surprising to see a greater deviation between the designed protein and the template crystal structure in this region. As might be expected, deviations in side-chain conformation between the NMR ensemble and the designed model were greater for surface residues than for buried residues. When all non-proton sidechain atoms are included, average r.m.s.d.s between the model and ensemble structures were 3.2 Å for non-polar residues and 5.2 Å for polar residues. In approximately 70% of all residues, 1 angles for the design model fit within a major cluster of 1 angles for the ensemble structures. One notable departure in side-chain conformation between the designed model and the experimentally determined structure was found in Phe44, where the side-chain in the designed model occupies space filled by the relatively disordered Trp4 side-chain in the experimental ensemble. In turn, the Phe48 side-chain of the designed model fills the area occupied by Phe44 from the NMR ensemble. These side-chain conformational differences may help to stabilize the altered backbone alignment for helix 3 (residues 39­48) found in the experimental structures. Overall, the UVF solution structure ensemble matches its backbone template well, indicating that the design procedure successfully produced a highly stabilized protein with the correct fold. Folding kinetic studies performed on UVF estimate that it folds with a rate constant of 79,000 s-1, faster than the natural protein and among the fastest reported
