The Crystal Structure of Lignin Peroxidase at Ê 1.70 A Resolution Reveals a Hydroxy Group on the Cb of Tryptophan 171: A Novel Radical Site Formed During the Redox Cycle
Thomas Choinowski, Wolfgang Blodig, Kaspar H. Winterhalter and Klaus Piontek*
È Laboratorium fur Biochemie I È Eidgenossische Technische È Hochschule, Universitatstrasse È 16, CH-8092 Zurich Switzerland The crystal structure of lignin peroxidase (LiP) from the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was re®ned to an R-factor of 16.2 % utilizing synchrotron data in the resolution range from 10 to Ê 1.7 A. The ®nal model comprises all 343 amino acid residues, 370 water molecules, the heme, four carbohydrates, and two calcium ions. Lignin peroxidase shows the typical peroxidase fold and the heme has a close environment as found in other peroxidases. During re®nement of the LiP model an unprecedented modi®cation of an amino acid was recognized. The surface residue tryptophan 171 in LiP is stereospeci®cally hydroxylated at the Cb atom due to an autocatalytic process. We propose that during the catalytic cycle of LiP a transient radical at Trp171 occurs that is different from those previously assumed for this type of peroxidase. Recently, the existence of a second substrate-binding site centered at Trp171 has been reported, by us which is different from the ``classical heme edge'' site found in other peroxidases. Here, we report evidence for a radical formation at Trp171 using spin trapping, which supports the concept of Trp171 being a redox active amino acid and being involved in the oxidation of veratryl alcohol. On the basis of our current model, an electron pathway from Trp171 to the heme is envisaged, relevant for the oxidation of veratryl alcohol and possibly lignin. Beside the opening leading to the heme edge, which can accommodate small aromatic substrate molecules, a smaller channel giving access to the distal heme pocket was identi®ed that is large enough for molecules such as hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, it was found that in LiP the bond between the heme iron and the Ne2 atom of the proximal histidine residue is signi®cantly longer than in cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP). The weaker Fe-N bond in LiP renders the heme more electron de®cient and destabilizes high oxidation states, which could explain the higher redox potential of LiP as compared to CcP.

Ê Structure of Lignin Peroxidase at 1.7 A Resolution

Introduction
Lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose are components that form the cell wall of plants. It has been estimated that lignin accounts for 15-36 % of woody biomass (Eriksson, 1993) and that approximately 25 % of all carbon ®xed by photosynthesis is eventually transformed to lignin (Tien, 1987). Therefore, its biological decomposition to humus and mineralization to carbon dioxide and water is an important factor in the carbon cycling of the biosphere. In agriculture and in the pulp and paper industry, large quantities of lignin and lignocellulose accrue. But these, in principle, valuable materials are usually treated as waste and not as they would deserve from an ecological and economical point of view. Lignin, a rather heterogeneous and complex biopolymer (Adler, 1977), consists of phenyl propanoid units, linked by various non-hydrolyzable C-C- and C-O- bonds. Certain microorganisms, in particular some ®lamentous fungi from the genus basidiomycete, are capable of degrading the recalcitrant lignin polymer (Shimada & Higuchi, 1991) to get access to the cellulose, which they use as an energy source. In this process, both extracellular metalloenzymes like peroxidases and laccases and aromatic/aliphatic metabolites are involved. Some of these oxidative metalloenzymes are able to oxidize high redox potential aromatic substrates and have unique catalytic properties compared to other members of the plant peroxidase superfamily. The propensity of the ligninolytic enzymes to degrade recalcitrant aromatic compounds has been considered to be advantageous for the design of new potential industrial bio-processes (Paice et al., 1995) and decontamination technologies (Hammel, 1992). One of the enzymes involved in lignin degradation is lignin peroxidase (LiP), a heme-containing glycoprotein, produced by e.g. the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. In total, 21 peroxidases are found in the extracellular ¯uid of ligninolytic cultures of this fungus (Leisola et al., 1987). Most of them are lignin peroxidase isozymes but variable amounts, depending on the culture conditions, are manganese peroxidases, which are also heme-containing glycoproteins with a high degree of homology to lignin peroxidase (Sundaramoorthy et al., 1994). LiP is thought to abstract electrons from the aromatic moieties of lignin, followed by a non-catalytic cleavage of e.g. the b-O-4 linkage, and various C-C-bonds (Lundell et al., 1993), including aromatic ring opening.

LiP, together with other fungal peroxidases, belongs to class II of the plant peroxidase superfamily (Welinder, 1992). Class II peroxidases, being secretory enzymes, differ from members of the class I by glycosylation, the existence of two structural calcium ions, and the formation of four conserved disul®de bridges. The role of these structural determinants is not known. The classical secretory plant peroxidases like horseradish peroxidase, tobacco peroxidase and peanut peroxidase belong to class III. Heme peroxidases oxidize a variety of compounds at the expense of hydrogen peroxide by basically the same two-electron multistep reaction as depicted in Scheme 1. Like other peroxidases, ferric LiP is ®rst oxidized by H2O2 to compound I (comp I), a two-electronoxidized intermediate, which is then reduced by one substrate molecule to the second intermediate compound II (comp II). Further reduction back to the resting enzyme can be accomplished either by the same substrate molecule or a second one. One oxidizing equivalent in comp I is stored as an oxoferryl species [Fe(IV)  O]2 and the second either as a porphyrin p-radical or a protein-based radical cation. Currently, cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) is the only peroxidase for which it has been demonstrated that the radical cation resides on a tryptophan residue (Sivaraja et al., 1989). But, where CcP has a tryptophan residue close to the heme carrying the radical in the ES-complex, LiP has a phenylalanine residue that cannot be oxidized. EPR spectroscopy yielded evidence for a porphyrin p-cation radical in LiPI (Khindaria & Aust, 1996). Previously, the crystal structure of lignin peroxidase was solved by us (Piontek et al., 1993) and independently by another group (Edwards et al., 1993). One outcome of these two structures is that the core of lignin peroxidase has basically the same fold as CcP (Finzel et al., 1984) with a rather similar heme cavity and arrangement of important activesite residues. It became obvious that the large biopolymer lignin cannot approach the heme. Despite the availability of a tertiary structure and a wealth of kinetic and spectroscopic data, the exact redox mechanism even with small molecular substrates is still unknown. In particular, the question of how LiP catalyzes the oxidation of compounds having a higher redox potential than those estimated for LiPI and LiPII (Schoemaker et al., 1994) is still open. A major role in lignin biodegradation has been attributed to veratryl alcohol, which is a secondary metabolite of the fungus and a good substrate for LiP (Lundquist & Kirk, 1978). Among its

proposed roles are protection of the enzyme from H2O2-dependent inactivation (Valli et al., 1990) and redox mediation (Harvey et al., 1986) between the enzyme and substrates that cannot approach the heme redox center. Other experiments imply that free VAÁ in solution can act as a diffusable oxidant (Candeias & Harvey, 1995). Furthermore, the lifetime of LiP-generated VAÁ is almost three orders of magnitude larger than the chemically produced radical because of stabilization in an enzyme pocket with a suitable micro-environment (Khindaria et al., 1996). Experimental data were presented by Aust and co-workers that con®rmed an earlier suggestion by Harvey et al. (1989). They (Khindaria et al., 1995) inferred from kinetic studies that LiPI and VA react to form a LiPII-VAÁ complex with a higher redox potential than uncomplexed LiPI and LiPII. This complex will then react with a second VA molecule to yield ferric LiP and a second VA radical. To explain the stochiometry of one VAD formed per H2O2 molecule, a dismutation of the two VA-radicals to one VAD and one VA was suggested (Khindaria et al., 1995). This concept could rationalize the essential irreversibility of the LiPI reduction by means of stabilization of the VAÁ by the enzyme and that of the second reductive step by the increased redox potential of the LiPII- VAÁ complex. Before 1993, CcP was the only available peroxidase tertiary structure (Finzel et al., 1984) on which structural and mechanistic considerations were based. Since then, the crystal structures of many new peroxidases have been determined (for a review, see Smith & Veitch, 1998). Most of them belong to class II, as ArP, CiP, LiP and MnP, but also structures of class III members, like HRP, barley (Henriksen et al., 1998a) and peanut peroxidase (Schuller et al., 1996) and of a class I peroxidases as pea cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (Patterson & Poulos, 1995) have been determined. So far, no substrate complex of LiP has been reported. Utilizing modeling studies, the possibility of a relatively small substrate access channel similar to the classical heme-edge substrate interaction site found in other peroxidases (Itakura et al., 1997; Henriksen et al., 1998b) has been probed by us (Schoemaker et al., 1994) and others (Poulos et al., 1993) and will be discussed here. Furthermore, our ®nding of a redox active tryptophan residue, which is situated on the surface of LiP, is evidence for the existence of a second, new ``non-heme edge'' long-range electron transfer site. The signi®cance of this site has been shown before (Blodig et al., 1998; Doyle et al., 1998) by means of chemical modi®cation and site-directed mutagenesis.

The ®nal R-factor is 16.2 % including re¯ections for jFj > 2s in the resolution Ê range 10-1.7 A. The stereochemistry of the atomic model shows a good agreement with ideality (Table 1). During re®nement the main-chain conformational angles were not restrained. Even so all residues are in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Figure 1), with 93.5 % being in the most favored region. The quality of the electron density was such that it was possible to build the whole polypeptide chain unambiguously and even to detect features at almost the atomic level. To illustrate the quality of the ®nal electron density, a portion of the (2Fo À Fc)exp(iac) map is depicted in Figure 2. An upper limit for the positional error

Results and Discussion
Quality and completeness of the model The structure of lignin peroxidase was originally determined by us with multiple isomorphous replacement methods using diffraction data colFigure 1. Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran et al., 1963) of the re®ned LiP415IEF structure. The plot was generated with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) representing the glycine residues as triangles.

was estimated by calculating a Luzatti (1952) and a sa plot (Read, 1986). For the model presented here, Ê both methods gave a value of about 0.15 A. The ®nal model comprises the whole polypeptide chain of 343 amino acid residues, one heme molecule, two calcium ions, four carbohydrate molecules, and 370 water molecules. Overall description of the LiP415 structure Ê Although the structure based on 1.7 A resolution data con®rms the overall model as previously described (Piontek et al., 1993), more structural

details with greater accuracy are revealed by the work presented here. Certain structural features (see below) that we report now are important for the understanding of the catalytic mechanism. On the other hand, it seems to be necessary to repeat some structural information already described at lower resolution in order to enable the reader to conceive a complete picture of lignin peroxidase. LiP has a rather globular shape, with dimensions Ê Ê Ê of about 50 A Â 40 A Â 40 A and is divided by the heme into a proximal and distal domain (Figure 3). The heme is completely embedded in the protein but is accessible from the solvent via two small channels. The monomeric LiP molecule contains eight major a-helices, A, B, D, F, G, H, I and N, and eight minor helices, C, E, K, L, M, O, P and Q. In addition, three short antiparallel b-sheets consisting of only two residues per strand (a-f) complete the fold. The secondary structure element

overall r.m.s. deviation between Ca atoms of LiP Ê and CcP is 1.78 A. Lignin peroxidase has an additional C-terminal peptide of about 50 amino acid residues as compared to CcP (Figure 5). This peptide has only a few secondary structural elements and is a mostly extended chain with little contact to the core of the protein. The C-terminal region loops from the bottom of the proximal domain and proceeds to the distal domain, where it ends approximately at an opening that gives access to the heme pocket. There are eight cysteine residues in LiP. All of them form disul®de bridges, one connects the C-terminal peptide with the core protein via residues 249 and 317 (compare Figure 3). Two calcium-binding sites were found in LiP, one in the distal and one in the proximal domain. Both are situated behind the active-site histidine residues if viewed from the iron and are coordinated by seven, respectively, eight, oxygen atoms Ê Ê in a range between 2.34 A and 2.72 A. The geometric parameters of the coordination spheres are typical for calcium ions, the corresponding re®ned Ê Ê B-factors were 7.7 A2 and 7.4 A2 for the proximal and distal calcium, respectively. The B-factors and the coordination geometry support the correct assignment of these atoms. Details of the proximal and distal calcium-binding site are shown in Figure 6. The proximal site is formed by a loop region including residues Asp194 to Asp201 and by Ser177 situated next to the proximal His176. Eight oxygen atoms coordinate the calcium ion, Ê having an average bond distance of 2.5 A (Figure 6(a)). The distal calcium-binding site is formed by residues Gly66 to Ser70, an extended chain region between helix C and D1, and Asp48 being next to the distal His47 in helix B (Figure 6(b)). Two water molecules take part in the 7-fold coordination of the central atom forming a pentagonal bipyramid. This kind of calcium coordination has been found in other proteins (Dhanaraj et al., 1996). The function of Ca2 in class II peroxidases is still unclear. They appear to contribute to a greater rigidity in the binding regions as indicated by a

well-de®ned protein vicinity associated with B-facÊ tors of about 10 A2 in the crystal structure. Since Ser177 is bound to the proximal calcium, the ¯exibility of the neighboring His176 coordinating the heme iron is more restricted than in CcP, which possesses no calcium. The proximal calcium might function to ®netune the topology of the active site, in particular the iron-histidine distance, which is suggested to in¯uence the redox potential (see below). Lignin peroxidase is a glycoprotein having a consensus Asn-Gln-Ser sequence for N-glycosylation. Omit maps revealed a well-de®ned electron density for the ®rst N-acetylglucosamine b-linked to Asn257, while the electron density for the second N-acetylglucosamine connected by a b-1,4 linkage is of poorer quality. An average temperaÊ ture factor of 36 A2 for the ®rst carbohydrate moiety indicates that even this sugar must be relatively ¯exible. Whether the carbohydrate chain is of the complex type, the hybrid type, or the high-mannose type could not be determined from the crystal structure. Carbohydrate analysis (data not published) has shown the existence of several additional mannose residues, indicating that the Nglycosylation could consist of a high mannose-type GlcNAc2Man7 as in ArP or CiP (Kunishima et al., 1994; Petersen et al., 1994). Although Schmidt et al. (1990) proposed that ligninases are also O-glycosylated, no sound biochemical information exists about the position or degree of the O-glycosylation. The crystal structure of LiP revealed two clearly de®ned O-glycosylation sites in the serine and threonine-rich C-terminal peptide, one at Ser334 and one at Thr320. All glycosylation sites are clustered at the ``upper'' portion of the proximal domain (Figure 3). Man370 bound to Ser334 showed the best de®ned electron density of all carbohydrate moieties. It has some extra density extending from O-4, indicating that this glycosylation is not built up by a single mannose residue as reported for CiP (Baunsgaard et al., 1993). The carbohydrate chains are concentrated at the top of the protein. It appears that they form a shielding for the otherwise exposed C-terminal

peptide and protect this portion of the protein against proteolytic attack. The heme and its vicinity The heme cavity The heme cavity is formed by about 40 residues situated in helices B, E, G, H, I, L and N, in b-strands b and e, and in connective peptides between helices D/F, b-strand a/helix H, helix I/b-strand b, b-strands b/c, and b-strand c/helix K. The heme iron is coordinated at the proximal Ê side by Ne2 of His176 with a bond length of 2.15 A (Figure 7 and Table 3). The sixth coordination site of the iron is occupied by a water molecule (Wat399), which is hydrogen-bonded to Ne2 of the distal His47 and two other water molecules. Furthermore, the heme is linked to the protein by hydrogen bonds between the propionate groups and Arg43, Ala180, Asn182 and Asp183. Most Ê notable is the strong hydrogen bond of 2.49 A length between the carboxylate group of the ``outer'' propionate group on pyrrole ring A and the carboxylate of Asp183. A second hydrogen Ê bond of 2.84 A is formed between the other carboxylate O atom of this propionate group and the

nitrogen atom of the peptide bond of Asp183. The ``inner'' propionate group on pyrrole ring D is hydrogen bonded to NH of Ala180 with a distance Ê of 2.98 A. The remaining H-bonds of the heme with the protein are with Arg43 and Asn182. They Ê are relatively weak, having distances of 3.20 A. Despite the majority of the heme cavity-forming residues being non-polar, only a few hydrophobic interactions are found between the protein and the prosthetic group. Table 4 shows the closest distances between atoms of the protoporphyrin IX and the protein. The heme is not planar but has a rather saddlelike shape with the nitrogen atoms of the opposing pyrrole rings A and C pointing towards the proximal side and the nitrogen atoms of rings B and D towards the distal side. The central iron ion is disÊ placed by 0.1 A towards the distal histidine residue from a least-squares plane formed by the pyrrole rings. Some relevant heme-ligand distances and distances within the heme are shown in Table 3. The distance of the axial water molecule to Ê the heme iron is 2.27 A, a value at the upper limit reported for hexa-coordinated ferric iron (International Tables, 1968). EPR spectroscopy (gx  5.83, gy  5.70, gz  2.02) and resonance Raman spectroscopy (data not shown), indicate that the heme

iron is predominantly ferric high spin. In accordance with recent UV-visible and resonance Raman spectroscopy studies (Smulevich, 1998), LiP415 was considered to be hexa-coordinated; even so, the water molecule is only loosely bound to the iron. As described in Materials and Methods, signi®cant residual density in difference maps was found close to the distal water molecule (Figure 7). After re®nement, the distance between the two Ê ``water'' molecules was only 1.41 A. The B-factor Ê of the more distant ``water'' molecule re®ned to 55 A Ê as compared to 8.5 A2 for the closer water molÊ ecule. It is not bound to the heme iron (2.88 A) but is hydrogen bonded with Ne2 of the distal His47 Ê (2.66 A). Optical spectra of some LiP415 samples in solution and of crystals (Figure 8) show that they contain a fraction of a low spin species that could be compound III, a ferrous oxygen complex (Mylrajan et al., 1990). Therefore, the additional density could be interpreted as one oxygen atom of a partially occupied O2 species. Another explanation would be that the two densities at the distal

site re¯ect an equilibrium between penta and hexacoordination of water at the heme iron in the crystal structure of LiP. In solution buffered at pH 4.5, native ferric enzyme was reported to show a temperature-dependent coordination state equilibrium from high spin penta-coordinated ($25  C) to a high spin hexa-coordinated state ($2  C; Andersson et al., 1987). This would support the effect of the elongated Fe-O distance observed in the LiP415 crystal structure measured at pH 4.0 and at $10  C. The peroxide binding pocket on the distal side of the heme is formed by residues Arg43, Phe46 and His47. Arg43 and His47 are conserved residues in peroxidases, while Phe46, which is almost coplanar to the heme pyrrole ring C, (compare Figure 7), is

817 metal, cofactors, and the redox potential. The latter will be in¯uenced by the protein environment, in particular by the coordination of the metal ion and the dielectric properties of the surrounding medium. In heme proteins having essentially identical metal centers, it is dif®cult to correlate the redox potential with a particular structural feature. For example, globins being oxygen carriers, have the same cofactor, a protoporphyrin IX heme with a histidine residue as ®fth axial ligand, as peroxidases. While the globins are characterized by a positive redox potential, therefore stabilizing the reduced state of the iron Fe(II), peroxidases have a negative redox potential that favors the oxidized state Fe(III). On the basis of investigations of heme model compounds and heme proteins it was proposed that the basicity (in other words the imidazolate character) of the axial histidine ligand controls the redox potential (Falk, 1964). In peroxidases this residue is strongly hydrogen bonded via Ne2 to a neighboring aspartate residue, which imparts a more imidazolate character to the histidine residue, thus stabilizing the high oxidation states of the heme. Banci and co-workers suggested that the higher redox potential of LiP as compared to CcP and HRP is due to a lesser imidazolate character of the proximal histidine (Banci et al., 1991). The Asp-His-Fe triad, which is conserved in peroxidases of the plant superfamily (Welinder & Gajhede, 1993), has been attributed to be one factor in modulating the imidazolate character of the proximal ligand (Goodin & McRee, 1993). In contrast, globins have a weak hydrogen bond between the histidine residue and a backbone carbonyl group, which explains, in part, the different redox potentials of the two classes of heme proteins. But a determinant that could rationalize the different redox potentials among peroxidases in which the Asp-His-Fe triad is conserved is still elusive. In LiP, for example, the hydrogen-bonding pattern between the proximal His and the neighboring Asp (Figure 7) is almost identical with that in CcP and other heme peroxidases. Millis et al. (1989) have determined the midpoint potential for the Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple of LiP and MnP isozymes. They range from about À130 mV for LiP to about À90 mV for MnP. For CcP and HRP, much lower values of À194 mV (Conroy et al., 1978) and À278 mV, respectively (Yamada et al., 1975), have been reported. A comparison of LiP415 and CcP shows that one factor that determines the redox potential could be related to the strength of the FeÊ Ne2(His) bond. In LiP415, this distance is 2.15 A Ê (which is approximately that found in the 1.80 A resolution structure of the LiP465 isozyme, PDB entry 1QPA), which is longer than in CcP, where Ê it is only 1.95 A. From a statistical point of view, one could argue that these differences are not signi®cant. However, there are structural properties in the LiP415 molecule that reveal chemical reasons for the prolonged Fe-Ne2 bond. The prox-

not conserved. In CcP, the corresponding residue is a tryptophan. The side-chain of Arg43 parallels the pyrrole rings A and D, and approaches the propionate group of pyrrole A, forming a hydrogen bond. This situation is almost identical in other peroxidase crystal structures. Arg43 plays a role in stabilizing negative charges during cleavage of peroxides and in the stabilization of the ferryl oxygen atom of comp 1, while His47 functions as a proton È È acceptor for the bound peroxide substrate (Fulop et al., 1994). From the distal side pocket, a channel extends towards the exterior of the protein. Several wellordered water molecules that are connected by a network of hydrogen bonds extend from the distal water molecule into the solvent region via this tunnel. Some of these water molecules are found in very similar positions in other peroxidase structures, like CcP, ArP and CiP (Finzel et al., 1984; Kunishima et al., 1994; Petersen et al., 1994). The proximal ligand His176 is hydrogen bonded to Asp238 (Figure 7) in a way similar to that in other heme peroxidases from the plant peroxidase superfamily. An in¯uence on the anionic character of the proximal ligand has been attributed to this particular H-bond in peroxidases (Goodin & McRee, 1993; and see below). The aromatic ring of Phe193 is both coplanar and within van der Waals contact distance to the imidazole ring of the proximal histidine. In CcP, the residue corresponding to Phe193 is Trp191, which carries the second oxidation equivalent in comp I. The role of the proximal histidine and the redox potential The activity of metalloenzymes catalyzing redox reactions depends on many factors, e.g. steric constraints, substrate accessibility to the

imal histidine is part of the 310-helix I2 that is formed by residues 173 to 178. In LiP, this peptide is moved away from the heme plane up to Ê about 1 A as compared to CcP (Figure 9). It is very likely that Ser177, which is strongly hydrogen bound via its hydroxy group to the mainchain O and N and to the side-chain Od2 of Asp201, is responsible for this movement. Furthermore, the side-chain of Ser177 is involved in the coordination of the proximal calcium ion. A similar situation is found in the X-ray structure of MnP (Sundaramoorthy et al., 1994), a peroxidase in which the coordination of the corresponding Ser177 to a calcium ion is conserved. There, Ê the length of the Fe-Ne2 bond is 2.28 A, which is Ê longer than in CcP. This correlates even 0.33 A nicely with the larger difference of the redox potential of MnP/CcP as compared to LiP/CcP. In CcP, no such interactions are possible, since Ser177 is replaced by an alanine residue. The displacement of helix I2 in LiP and MnP that causes the movement of the proximal histidine residue away from the heme weakens the Fe-N bond and the heme iron will be more electron de®cient. This in turn destabilizes the high oxidation state of the iron. In other words, the redox potential becomes higher. In the crystal structure of native Ê HRP, determined at 2.15 A resolution (Gajhede et al., 1997; PDB entry 1ATJ), the distance from Ê the iron to Ne2 is 2.19 A. This value does apparently not ful®l the anticipated correlation with the redox potential. Whether other factors govern the redox potential in this case or if the reported distance is related to a too tight handling of the restraints during re®nement is not known. Access channels to the distal side pocket The heme is not in direct contact with the bulk solvent. A cleft formed by peptides of residues His82-Glu89, Glu146-Phe148, Asn182-Asp184,

Asn221-Gln222 and Pro340-His341, which is further subdivided by side-chain atoms of Ile85 and Asp183 and the heme propionate D into a smaller and a larger channel (Figure 10) provide access to the surface. Basically, this cleft is conserved in heme peroxidases but varies considerably in size. In particular, CiP has a substantially larger opening than LiP; the situation is intermediate for CcP. While the fold of the cleft-forming residues in all three peroxidases is similar, the extent of the opening is governed by amino acid side-chains. LiP has bulkier residues like Ile85, Glu146, Phe148, Asp183 and His82, whose side-chains intrude into the entrance, while in CiP these amino acid residues are replaced by glycine and proline. This is particularly interesting with respect to the substrate speci®city of the two enzymes and has been tested recently by site-directed mutagenesis for LiP (Doyle et al., 1998). Previous modeling studies have suggested a possible veratryl alcohol binding site in the larger of the two channels leading to the heme (Schoemaker et al., 1994), which is referred to as the heme access channel. This apolar cavity in the vicinity of the heme edge is accessible to the surface of the protein. The major hydrophobic contacts of this modeled veratryl alcohol molecule with the protein are with His82, Ile85, Pro147, Phe148, Asp183 and Val184, forming at the same time a hydrogen bond with Ne2 of His82 at the entrance of the active-site channel (Figure 10). Furthermore, the 4-methoxy group of the veratryl alcohol approaches the heme at the 8-methyl substituent and the propionate group of the pyrrole ring A within van der Waals distances. In this proposed binding mode, a putative meta-methoxy substituent in the 5-position of the substrate molecule would have unfavorable interactions with Ile85 and Asp183. Thus, 3,4,5trimethoxybenzyl alcohol is predicted to be a

In the middle of the picture, from the very left to the very right side, the whole cleft that gives access to the heme is visible. Sidechains of residues Ile85 and Asp183 divide this cleft into a larger, putative substrate-binding channel (left side), and a smaller channel, through which peroxide molecules might approach the distal side of the heme. The modeled substrate molecule veratryl alcohol is depicted in bold. The hydrogen bond between His82 and the hydroxy group of veratryl alcohol is shown.

poorer substrate for LiP, as observed experimentally (Ageorges et al., 1991), supporting the modeling studies. In the crystal structures of the ArP (Itakura et al., 1997) and HRP (Henriksen et al., 1998b) substrate complexes, this access channel has been identi®ed as being the binding site for the aromatic donor molecule benzhydroxamic acid (BHA). In these structures, the substrate approaches the heme cavity with the aromatic ring of BHA being almost coplanar with the heme and extends to the entrance of the access channel. A number of hydrogen bonds to distal site residues and to the water ligand at the sixth position of the heme iron are formed with the hydrophilic moiety of the substrate. But Henriksen et al. (1998b) comment that these interactions of the atypical reducing substrate BHA are not possible for most other substrates. Rather, they argue that the more hydrophobic region at the peripheral side of the access channel functions as a binding site for other aromatic substrates, without allowing direct access to the ferryl oxygen atom. This alternative binding mode would be similar to what we proposed for VA in the active site channel of LiP. The smaller channel is built up by primarily polar residues supplying a route from the surface of the enzyme between the two heme propionate groups directly to the distal site of the heme. The channel ends at the conserved Arg43, which is involved in binding of the peroxides. Modeling studies show that the size of this channel is suf®cient for hydrogen peroxide molecules to diffuse into the distal site pocket but is too narrow for aromatic substrate molecules (Figure 11). This second, smaller access channel would not require that small molecules bound in the larger channel must move out to allow hydrogen peroxide to react with the heme.

The modification at Trp171 Identification and formation of a hydroxy group bound to Cb of Trp171 A strong spherical density (Figure 12) close to the Cb atom of Trp171 was found in a (Fo À Fc)exp(iac) map of the LiPIEF crystal structure puri®ed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) To exclude the possibility that this modi®cation originated from the IEF procedure, the crystal structure of LiP puri®ed by fast performance liquid chromatography was also determined. It revealed a similar strong density in a difference omit map (Figure 12), using the phases derived from the LiPIEF model (see Materials and Methods). After re®nement of a ``water'' molecule (Trp171OH) at this site in the Ê LiPIEF structure, the B-factor was only 9.0 A2. This rather low temperature factor is comparable to those of the Trp171 atoms, which range from 8.3 to Ê 10.0 A2, although the additional oxygen atom was not restrained with the atoms of Trp171. The angle Trp171OH-Cb171-Ca171 is 111 and Trp171OH-CbCg is 112  , the distance Trp171OH-Cb171 being Ê 1.42 A. This modi®cation renders the previously non-chiral Cb atom asymmetrical to an S-con®guration. No density was found for the R-con®guration. Based on the geometry, we assumed an OHgroup that is supported by the chemical environment and the possible hydrogen bonds. The postulated OH-group is in van der Waals distance from the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Asp264 and of Trp171, favoring hydrogen bonds and excluding the possibility of a double-bonded oxygen species. The theoretical case that residue 171 is a mixture of Trp and Thr or Ser can be excluded, since the temperature factors of the Trp side-chain atoms and the OH group are low and not signi®cantly differ-

ent from those of the Cb and Cg2 atoms. However, this would be expected for a superimposed structure partially occupied by Trp and Thr/Ser. To characterize the chemical nature of the modi®cation, we performed tryptic digestion of LiP (Blodig et al., 1998). The peptide fragments obtained were analyzed by HPLC (Figure 13) and UV-visible spectroscopy (Figure 14). An unusual absorbance spectrum with lmax  333 nm of the Trp171-containing peptide was observed, which is identical with that of N-acetyl-a,b-didehydrotryptophanamide (Figure 14) formed upon water elim-

ination from b-hydroxy tryptophan. Such a spectrum was not observed when using recombinant, pristine lignin peroxidase expressed in Escherichia coli (Doyle & Smith, 1996) that has not reacted with hydrogen peroxide before. After addition of a few equivalents of this substrate to the recombinant LiP, the unusual absorbance could again be followed. These experiments prove that the modi®cation on the Cb atom of Trp171 does indeed exist and that it does not originate from the applied IEF puri®cation step, but rather is the result of an H2O2-dependent, autocatalytic process.

821 phan at pH 4.5 is 1.19 V (Jovanovic et al., 1991) as compared to about 1.4 V for VA (Khindaria et al., 1996). Consequently, in terms of thermodynamics, oxidation of tryptophan is easier than of VA. Trp171 in LiP is a likely candidate to which oxidizing equivalents will be conferred, since its location not far from the heme may render its oxidation also kinetically feasible. Thus, a Trp radical cation (TrpÁ) would result. At pH 4.5 of the cultivation medium the TrpÁ, having a pK of 4.3 (Jovanovic & Simic, 1985) for deprotonation of the pyrrole N-H, is in equilibrium with its neutral radical. From the latter on, two routes to Cb hydroxylation can be envisaged (Scheme 2). In the ®rst route (A) a second electron may be abstracted either by LiPII or a newly formed LiPI, followed by deprotonation at Cb and Michael-type addition of water to yield the b-hydroxy compound. In this reaction sequence no molecular oxygen would be required. Alternatively, a peroxyl radical at C3 of the indol ring could be formed from the reaction with molecular oxygen (route B). Elimination of superoxide will then be followed by addition of water as above. Currently we prefer route A, since the process was found to be independent of the presence of molecular oxygen (Blodig et al., 1998). Further oxidation of the Cb

The peak marked with 2 is again due to the Trp171-containing tryptic peptide and its absorbance spectrum is shown as spectrum 2 in Figure 14.

For a high-potential redox enzyme like LiP, the involvement of an autocatalytical self-oxidation appears to be most probable. After formation of LiPI the enzyme turns quite rapidly to LiPII, even in the absence of reducing substrates, indicating the presence of an endogenous electron donor (Harvey et al., 1989; Marquez et al., 1988). The standard one-electron redox potential of a free trypto-

822 hydroxy tryptophan to the b-keto compound does apparently not occur. On the one hand the b-hydroxy state is stabilized by a net of hydrogen bonds as described above, on the other hand considerable energy would be required to change the tetrahedral Cb to a trigonal geometry within the restraint environment of the protein. Evidence for the existence of a transient radical on Trp171 was obtained by analysis of a reaction product of LiP with the spin-trap MNP, which was obtained after addition of hydrogen peroxide to a LiP/MNP mixture. This enzyme preparation was tryptically digested and analyzed with HPLC. The resulting peptide maps revealed peaks with absorbance characteristics different from those obtained when either H2O2 or MNP were left out, indicating that a trapping reaction had occured. In Figure 13 it is shown that the peak with the most intense 333 nm absorbance from the native protein is drastically weakened upon MNP/H2O2 treatment and instead a new peak is formed whose absorbance extends into the yellow region of the spectrum (Figure 14). The fraction of this peak was collected and by sequencing it was identi®ed as the Trp171containing peptide. Since Trp171 is the most redox active residue of this peptide, it is assumed to be the trapped residue. The structure of the chromophore resulting from MNP spin-trapping with LiP was not elucidated yet, but even so our results suggest that Trp171 indeed harbors a transient radical after the oxidation of LiP with H2O2. Further support of this proposal comes from the observation that the lifetime of LiPI is increased in the W171F and W171S mutants of LiP (Doyle et al., 1998). Function of Trp171 LiP is capable of oxidizing ferrocytochrome c even in the absence of VA (Wariishi et al., 1994). They suggested a direct electrostatic interaction of this substrate with the LiP surface. LiP isozymes are acidic proteins with pI values of about 4 (Leisola et al., 1987), while cytochrome c is strongly basic (Ferguson-Miller et al., 1979). To ®nd a possible binding region for cytochrome c, we have inspected the LiP surface for the distribution of ionizable amino acids and found that these residues are not distributed randomly. Instead, basic residues are mostly found in a surface region around the heme access channel (the so-called ``front side''), whereas acidic residues accumulate on the opposite side (the ``back'' side) as depicted in Figure 15. This charge distribution results in an electrical dipole with its positive end pointing roughly towards the heme access channel and its negative pole towards Trp171, suggesting the vicinity of Trp171 to be the binding region for cytochrome c and possibly other positively charged substrate molecules. The activity of cytochrome c oxidation by LiP was found to be determined by electrostatic substrate binding with an optimum at pH 4 (Wariishi et al., 1994). Our results allow us to

explain the decreasing activity at pH values lower than four with the protonation of the acidic residues on the back side of LiP. While for some related peroxidases, like ArP (Itakura et al., 1997), HRP (Henriksen et al., 1998b) and CcP (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992), the substrate oxidation sites are known, it is still elusive for LiP. Due to its suitable size to accommodate VA in the proximity of the heme and the heme propionate groups, we and others have assumed the heme access channel to be the place of VA binding (Figure 10) and stabilization of the emerging VAÁ, but no direct experimental con®rmation is available. Khindaria et al. (1995) have given evidence for the formation of a LiPII-VAÁ complex resulting from LiPI and VA, and suggested an acidic environment to stabilize VAÁ. However, based on our results that Trp171 is redox active and, since it is surrounded by acidic residues, we suggested the surface area at Trp171 as an alternative binding site for VA and other aromatic substrates (Blodig et al., 1998). Inspection of the close environment of Trp171 shows that there are three acidic residues surrounding Trp171 that are conserved among LiP isozymes. Asp264 and Glu168 are within van der Waals contact distance from the tryptophan side-chain and Glu250 forms a hydroÊ gen bond of 2.8 A with the indole nitrogen atom. Furthermore, a hydrophobic, concave ditch comprising some phenylalanine residues near Trp171 could be involved in non-polar interactions with an aromatic substrate. Trp171 is conserved in all

Ê Structure of Lignin Peroxidase at 1.7 A Resolution

823 investigations can be found by crystal structure analysis. These modi®cations usually indicate residues of special importance during catalysis. In the high-resolution crystal structure of LiP415 presented here, we have found an unusual hydroxylation at the Cb atom of a tryptophan residue resulting from an intermediate radical. This residue, which is located at the surface and close to the heme, is conserved in all LiP isozymes but does not exist in other peroxidases. Tryptophan 171 is considered to be part of an electron transfer pathway and an electron entry site to the heme. The current structural model formed the basis for other experiments that have been performed recently and that show that Trp171 is indeed an essential residue for catalysis. Furthermore, these experiments provided evidence for the existence of two distinct substrate interaction sites. One being in the heme access channel, as suggested by modeling studies, and a new site at or in close vicinity to Trp171. The availability of a recombinant LiP (Doyle & Smith, 1996) will provide the means for further investigations of these issues by means of sitedirected mutagenesis.

known LiP sequences (Baunsgaard et al., 1993), indicating that it is an essential residue. Interestingly, no Trp residue is found in MnP at this position despite a high degree of sequence homology (about 66 % identical amino acids) between the two enzymes. Unlike LiP, MnP makes use of diffuseable Mn3 to oxidize substrates. Strikingly, an unusual manganese peroxidase has been reported recently that is able to oxidize ef®ciently VA (Hein¯ing et al., 1998) and that contains a tryptophan residue at a position equivalent to Trp171 in LiP. The proposal that Trp171 is indeed the VA interaction site in LiP is supported by work with site-directed mutants (Doyle et al., 1998). In mutants where Trp171 was substituted by Phe and Ser, essentially no activity towards VA was found, while still maintaining activity with two dye substrates. On the other hand, a mutation (E146G) at the entrance to the active-site channel showed only a minor decrease of activity with respect to VA but had a remarkable increase on the pKa for the oxidation of a negatively charged dye. These experiments imply the existence of two distinct substrate-binding sites in LiP. Previously, it was suggested that VA and VAÁ bind at different sites in LiP (Khindaria et al., 1995). In LiP415, long-range electron transfer from Trp171 to the heme seems to be feasible, since, the typical, rapid reduction of LiPI was found to be absent in the Trp171 mutants (Doyle et al., 1998). The most probable electron pathway appears to be via Met172. Its Cb and Cg atom are within van der Waals distance of the heme edge (Figure 12) in the crystal structure of LiP415. In the LiP465 crystal structure (data not shown), residue 172 is Leu. Here too, the Cb atom is in close contact to the heme. It would be interesting to test the suggested electron pathway by investigation of a mutant where residue 172 is substituted by Gly. At present we cannot decide if the modi®cation on Cb of Trp171 is needed for catalysis or if it is a byproduct of the redox cycle with no, or only a minor, effect on function. Simple chemical considerations on substituent effects, however, imply that the HO- group could have an electron withdrawing effect on the indole ring. This effect is expected to destabilize a radical and to increase the redox potential to an extent that is dif®cult to estimate.

Materials and Methods
Enzyme production, purification and crystallization Lignin peroxidase was obtained from the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, strain BKM-F-1767 (ATCC 24725). The fungus was grown in C-limited agitated cultures at 37  C as described (Haemmerli et al., 1986). Peroxidase production was induced with 1.5 mM veratryl alcohol and 0.725 mM manganese-II-sulfate after 72 hours of growth. The culture ¯uid was harvested 48 hours after induction by ®ltration. Up to four harvesting cycles could be made with semi-continuous cultivation. The enzyme puri®cation was usually performed as reported by Glumoff et al. (1989), including preparative isoelectric focusing for the separation of about 21 peroxidase isozymes. Alternatively FPLC anion-exchange chromatography with a MonoQ column applying an acetate buffer gradient (pH 5.9) from 10 mM to 1 M was used (Tien & Kirk, 1988). The two LiP415 samples obtained were charge isomers as judged by analytical isoelectric focusing. The crystallization conditions were as described (Piontek et al., 1993). Crystals of the isoelectrically focused and of the FPLC-puri®ed lignin peroxidase were isomorphous and obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion. The crystals belong to space group Ê P212121 with unit cell dimensions a  60.70 A, Ê Ê b  74.71 A, c  106.35 A, with one molecule per asymÊ metric unit and a VM value of 2.94 A3/Da (Matthews, 1968). Spin trapping of LiP with MNP MNP (from Aldrich) was dissolved and converted from the dimer to the monomer by heating an aqueous suspension in an Eppendorf tube for one hour in the dark at 50 C. It was then put on ice in the dark. LiP (3.5 mM in 60 mM sodium tartrate pH 3.0 containing 50 % (v/v) of a freshly prepared MNP solution) was treated with a total of 60 equivalents of H2O2 in three por-

Conclusions
There is an increasing amount of reports on covalent modi®cations in redox enzymes that have been found either in crystal structures or by spectroscopic methods.

tions in ®ve minute intervals. HPLC peptide mapping was performed as described (Blodig et al., 1998). Transmission spectrum of LiP415 crystals Spectral measurements were done with a Universal Microscopic Spectral Photometer (Zeiss UMSP 80) at the È Scienti®c Service of the Kriminalpolizei Zurich. Thin crystals were positioned between two quarz cover-slides. Glycerol was used to give contact between the upper cover-slide and the ocular. The transmission spectra were recorded at 1 nm steps between 250 nm and 750 nm. Data collection and processing Diffraction data of the LiPIEF crystals were collected at the EMBL Outstation at the synchrotron DESY in Hamburg at station X31. Data processing and scaling was performed with the programs DENZO (Otwinowski, 1993a) and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993b) and ®nally merged using the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). The data sets of the LiPFPLC crystals were collected on a conventional rotating anode generator utilizing CuKa radiation. Processing and scaling was performed with the program XDS written by Kabsch (1988). Statistics of the data collection and processing is shown in Table 5. Refinement of the LiPIEF crystal structure The LiP415 structure was originally solved with the Ê MIR-method and a model re®ned to 2.5 A was reported by Piontek et al. (1993). This structure was based on diffraction data from a conventional rotating anode. From a Ê model re®ned with 8-2 A resolution data, only the polypeptide chain was used as a starting point for the re®nement of the structure using data collected with Ê synchrotron radiation. The initial R-factor for 8-2 A data was 43.0 %, applying a 2s cutoff. Next, a rigid body re®nement of the complete protein was performed È È within the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992; Brunger Ê et al., 1987) utilizing data from 8-2 A resolution. The procedure converged with an R-factor of 29.3 % for 2s data. Based on difference electron density maps, the heme, two calcium ions, three carbohydrate molecules and 262 water molecules were included into the model. The criteria for the assignment of a solvent molecule was, that the corresponding density in a Fo À Fc map had to be at least contoured at a 2s level and 1s for a 2Fo À Fc map.

Ê Structure of Lignin Peroxidase at 1.7 A Resolution In addition, the potential water molecules had to be at reasonable hydrogen-bonding distances from a possible donor or acceptor atom of the protein or from another solvent molecule. Subsequently, upon re®nement, solvent molecules were rejected if they exceeded a B-factor Ê of 50 A2. The initial atomic model was further improved with re®nement utilizing simulated annealing within the program X-PLOR, employing the slow-cooling protocol suggested by Weis et al. (1990). The R-factor dropped to Ê 19.0 % for 8-2 A resolution data and further to 18.3 % after individual B-factor re®nement. Further re®nement, Ê Ê including phase extension to 1.7 A, respectively, 10.0 A resolution, proceeded with the restrained least-squares programs PROTIN/PROLSQ (Hendrickson, 1985). At a Ê resolution of 1.8 A, a spherical density with at least 10s being the strongest peak of a difference map, was found Ê at a distance of about 1.4 A from the Cb atom of Trp171. An oxygen atom was modeled into this density and included into the re®nement as a pseudo water molecule. Furthermore, after inclusion of a water molecule at the distal site of the heme, a strong residual electron density with at least 5s was recognized in a difference map at the above resolution within covalent bonding distance of the distal water molecule but further away from the iron atom. This density indicated either a second, disordered water molecule or a diatomic ligand. Due to the uncertainty of the exact nature of the distal site ligand, a second water molecule was included into the model and re®ned without restraints. During the whole re®nement procedure no restraint was imposed on the Fe-N bonds of the heme moiety or the bonds of the distal ligand. Difference maps of LiPFPLC Ê Electron density maps for 8-2 A resolution data (2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc) were calculated using the structure factor amplitudes of the LiPFPLC crystal and the phases from the re®ned LiPIEF model, omitting either the contribution of the whole Trp171 residue or only of the hydroxy group at the Cb atom. Miscellaneous The re®nement program package X-PLOR was run on a Cray YMP/464 and the CCP4 version of PROLSQ/ PROTIN on a VAX 6000. Fitting of the atomic model to the electron density maps was performed on a Silicon Graphics 4D/220 GTX with the program CHAIN (Sack, 1988). Electron density maps (2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc) were
