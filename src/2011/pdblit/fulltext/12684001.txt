Urokinase is a serine protease involved in cancer growth and metastasis. Here we present the ®rst urokinase crystal structure in complex with Ê reversible inhibitors at 2.1 and 2.6 A resolution. These inhibitor complex structures have been obtained from crystals of engineered urokinase type plasminogen activator designed to obtain a crystal form open for inhibitor soaking. The mutant C122S loses its ¯exible A-chain upon activation cleavage and crystallises in the presence of benzamidine, which was later displaced by the desired inhibitor. This new soakable crystal form turned out to be of great value in the process of structure-based drug design. The evaluated binding mode of amiloride, and UKI-1D revealed a new subsite of the primary speci®city pocket of urokinase that will be employed in the future ligand optimisation process.

Introduction
The urokinase system, consisting of the urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), its receptor (uPAR) and its inhibitors (PAI-1, PAI-2) has been described to have a profound impact on diverse processes, such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and motility, but it also affects tissue

reorganisation and angiogenesis (Rabbani et al., 1995; May et al., 1998; Porter & Hogg, 1998; Rabbani & Xing, 1998; Irigoyen et al., 1999). However, the mechanisms are complex and not entirely explained by the catalytic activity of uPA. After synthesis of the uPA zymogen it is subject to cleavage by, e.g. plasmin or kallikrein, and is thereby transformed into its active two-chain form (tcuPA). This activation cleavage is facilitated when uPA is localised to the site of activity by its speci®c receptor (uPAR). Active uPA transforms plasminogen to plasmin, a protease with a broad speci®city, which activates matrix metallo proteases (MMPs). Through this cascade-like mechanism the extracellular matrix is ®nally degraded. At the same time, demand on urokinase inhibitors is growing, since disregulation of the uPA system is connected to cancer growth and metastasis (Reuning et al., 1998). Over-expression of uPA or its receptor leads to an increased tumour growth and metastasis rate (Shapiro et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1998), conversely transformation of uPA antisense sequences or over-expression of PAI1/2 decreases it (Praus et al., 1999).

Alternatively, strategies employing uPAR antagonists, e.g. antibodies or uPA analogues are successful by competing for binding to uPAR (Burgle et al., 1997), and consequently less uPA is concentrated on the front of invading cells. Inhibitors of urokinase have been shown to decrease cancer growth and the rate of metastasis. These include benzo[b]thiophen-2-carboxamidine (Towle et al., 1993; Rabbani et al., 1995; Alonso et al., 1998) and TIPPS-derivatives of amidinoÈ phenylalanine (Sturzebecher et al., 1999) as well as amiloride (Iishi et al., 1995; Evans et al., 1998; Ray et al., 1998). Although some of these inhibitors have binding constants in the sub-micromolar range and are being developed as drug candidates, as yet no real breakthrough has been obtained in achieving all the requirements for a therapeutic for the treatment of cancer on the basis of uPA inhibition. Structure-based drug design using crystals of uPA in complex with lead components is expected to greatly accelerate the inhibitor optimisation processes. Due to the ¯exibility of the enzyme and the small molecule inhibitor, it remains dif®cult to predict the binding mode of a compound. This is still the case when the binding mode of similar inhibitors with related enzymes are known. When the kinetics of a compound reveal an unexpected Ki value or selectivity, it is especially dif®cult to predict the actual complex structure, and frequently it has been found that these inhibitors bind in a different way, employing new subsites for binding. Unfortunately the only successful crystallisation reported so far is for a covalently inactivated catalytic domain of uPA in complex with EGR-cmk (Spraggon et al., 1995). These crystals were dif®cult to reproduce and had a tendency to twin. Furthermore, due to the covalent modi®cation this inhibitor could not be exchanged for other inhibitors. Therefore, we mutated the original uPA sequence, as an attempt at crystal engineering, to search for new uPA crystallisation conditions that should leave the active site accessible for inhibitor substitution by soaking. Here we describe two uPA structures, one in complex with amiloride and the other in complex with an amidinophenylalaninederivative (UKI-1D), which were derived from crystals initially grown in the presence of benzamidine.

acid residues (47.7 kDa; GenBank accession A73054). In this uPA numbering scheme the single-chain uPA catalytic domain consists of .the amino acid residues 167 to 421; subsequently these have been renumbered according the chymotrypsinogen primary structure from 1 to 250 (Figure 1) (Wang et al., 1985). In the following description only the chymotrypsinogen numbering is used. Upon activation of uPA the scissile bond between Lys15 and Ile16 is cleaved, resulting in a uPA two-chain form with the A-chain still bound to the catalytic B-chain through the disulphide bridge Cys1 to Cys122. The A-chain has been observed to be disordered in several similar serine protease crystal structures and consequently we produced a uPA mutant C122S that would lose its A-chain upon activation cleavage. Expression of active chymotrypsin family serine proteases in Escherichia coli is dif®cult, since the N-terminal Ile is crucial for the activity, but cleavage of the terminal Met-Ile bond by the bacterial processing protease is incomplete. Therefore, uPA was expressed as the inactive single chain form and activated later by plasmin cleavage. This was also advantageous because of decreased self digestion during the ten days of refolding. An E. coli expression system was chosen for uPA production because the proteins obtained are unglycosylated. Thus, without additional mutations another source of heterogenity and ¯exibility is removed. Since expression of the protein in its original sequence failed in various combinations of helper plasmids and bacteria strains, we adapted the initial three codons towards the preferred codon usage of E. coli. With this alteration the protein expression in inclusion bodies was successful with the E. coli strain BL21/DE3 co-transformed with the helper plasmid pLysS, which encodes for the T7 polymerase inhibitor lysozyme. The production of this variant in inclusion bodies appeared to be straightforward, as full-length uPA has been produced from this source by Winkler and co-workers (Winkler & Blaber, 1986). Thus, the protocols of preparation of the inclusion bodies, the refolding procedure and the puri®cation, including an af®nity chromatography step on benzamidine agarose, were adapted. Crystallisation Following the procedure explained in Materials and Methods essentially pure and active uPA C122S B-chain (bc-uPA) inhibited with benzamidine was obtained. Initial crystallisation trials yielded spherolytes, that, after optimisation of the concentrations of benzamidine, salt, precipitant, the temperature and the device used for crystallisation, occasionally resulted in large single crystals. In the ®nal optimised crystallisation conditions 2 ml of bc-uPA solution (15 mg/ ml) was mixed with 1 ml of reservoir solution (1 M Li2SO4, 0.8 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M sodium

Results and Discussion
Crystallisation trials with the two-chain uPA catalytic domain in complex with a variety of inhibitors resulted only in twinned crystals. Thus, in an attempt at crystal engineering we followed a rationale to produce a variant of the enzyme shortened in the presumed ¯exible regions. Fulllength human urokinase consists of 424 amino

Nevertheless, crystal reproduction was dif®cult but seeding and employment of freshly prepared material increased the rate of success. Depending on the size and the inhibitor soaked, the crystals were Ê of varying quality and diffracted from 2.6 A to Ê 1.8 A resolution. The statistics of the data sets are summarised in Table 1. Due to the good quality of the initially solved uPA structure in complex with benzamidine, the other inhibitor complex structures were solved directly with the phases obtained from this model without water molecules and inhibitor. Amiloride and the amidinophenylalanine derivative UKI-1D were built into the difference density and re®ned (Table 2).

six-stranded b-barrels. The active site and the catalytic residues are located at the junction of both barrels (Figure 1). The bc-uPA structure in complex with benzamidine differs only slightly from the two chain urokinase structure in complex with EGR-cmk reported by Spraggon et al. (1995). But in contrast to this covalently, and thus irreversibly inhibited structure, the crystals grown in complex with benzamidine remain accessible for substitution with other inhibitors. Examination of the packing of the molecules in the crystals reveals that the active site is completely accessible from a

large solvent channel and is involved in crystal contacts only on its borders. Thus, we can presume we have found a crystal form that can accommodate large inhibitors, that may be introduced into the crystal simply by soaking. Furthermore, the reported crystals diffract to much higher resolution, resulting in a more detailed picture of the structure and the binding mode of the inhibitors. Nevertheless, some differences between the structures of EGR-cmk/tc-uPA and bc-uPA are observed. Due to the higher resolution of our structure the rotamer of all side-chains could be deter-

mined. The A-chain, which was partly visible in the tc-uPA-structure, is according to the introduced mutation at C122S not present in bc-uPA. At the position where the A-chain is normally bound to the core protein one major crystal contact is formed in the bc-uPA structure. The 146-149 loop makes extensive contacts to this region and tc-uPA would not ®t into the packing of this crystal. Thus, deletion of the A-chain is a pre-requisite for this new crystal form. Amino acid residue Ile47 in bc-uPA is a methionine residue in the tc-uPA sequence. Both sequences are found in the GenBank and represent a variation in the human gene pool. Furthermore, the tc-uPA structure was solved in space group R3 in contrast to the bc-uPA structure solved in P212121, which results in differing conformations of the amino acid side-chains involved in crystal conÊ tacts. The 97 loop closes by 1.5 A in the EGR-cmk

inhibited structure so that the carbonyl group of 97b forms a hydrogen bond to the amino terminus of the inhibitor. This results in a conformational rearrangement of the amino acid residues in this loop. The high-resolution structure of bc-uPA allowed the incorporation of water molecules, for example in the speci®city pocket, which is conserved in the complex structures of benzamidinelike inhibitors with other serine proteases. This water molecule is clearly de®ned in the described structures, and forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen atom of amino acid residue 219 and the amidino group of benzamidine. The UKI-1D/b c-uPA complex b Since it was our aim to ®nd a universally soakable crystal form of the uPA catalytic domain we

tried to substitute the co-crystallised benzamidine with the amidinophenylalanine derivative UKI-1D (Table 3), a rather big and compact inhibitor, as shown by complex structures of related compounds in trypsin (Renatus et al., 1998). Surprisingly, when we calculated difference electron density maps from data sets taken with UKI-1D-

soaked crystals, the inhibitor was clearly visible. The difference density implied binding in a mode closely related to the known binding mode in trypsin. A projection indicating the interaction between bc-uPA and UKI-1D's shown in Figure 3(a) and the re®ned model of the inhibitor bond to bc-UPA is shown in Figure 4(a). This rather bulky inhibitor

almost completely ®lls the active site with only few polar interactions to the protein. Speci®c recognition is mainly mediated through the amidino phenyl moiety binding into the S1 pocket, with the amidino group forming the characteristic canonical salt bridge with Asp189. The triisopropylphenylsulfonyl residue and the piperazin-b-alanine residue form a compact structure that binds in the direction of the S3 pocket with the b-alanine nitrogen hydrogen group bonding to the OH group of Tyr94. Nevertheless, the inhibitor ®ts well into the active site and several hydrophobic contacts are formed. One of the isopropyl substituents of the triisopropyl-phenylsutfonyl group binds into a small pocket between Trp215 and Leu97b. The piperazin-b-alanine aligns with His57 and is clamped between this residue and His99. A variety of related amidinophenylalanine derivatives are È described (Sturzebecher et al., 1999), which form a group of inhibitors that reach binding constants in the sub-micromolar range and are among the most potent uPA inhibitors described so far. The derivatives UKI-1D (Ki  0.64 mM) and UKI-1 (Ki  0.41 mM) differ only in the carboxylic acid ethylester, which is substituted by b-alanine in UKI-1D (Table 3). This includes two alterations: the Ca atom of b-alanine is an oxygen atom in UKI-1 and the b-aminogroup is replaced. From the structure of UKI-1 in complex with bovine trypsin it was speculated that the carbonyl group of the balanine substituent could make a productive interaction with His99. In the solved structure this is not the case. This carbonyl group points away from His99 but this orientation enables the hydrogen bond of the b-alanine amino group with Tyr194. The twofold higher inhibition constant of UKI-1D, in comparison with UKI-1, may be due to

two alternative possibilities. The b-alanine carbonyl group may bind to His99 in UKI-1, which is in contrast to the binding mode of UKI-1D. More likely is the hydrogen bonding of the extra oxygen atom of UKI-1 to His99. One of these additional interactions counterbalances the lost hydrogen bond of the b-alanine amino group. The interaction mode of the bound inhibitor to urokinase with its contacts to His99 and Leu99b explains the binding speci®city compared to tPA (UKI-1D; Ki  8.7 mM). His99 is a tyrosine in tPA and Leu99b is part of a two-amino acid insertion not present in tPA. The amiloride/b c-uPA complex b Encouraged by the ease of structure solution with UKI-1D we tried to solve the structure of the commercially available anti-diuretic compound amiloride in complex with bc-uPA. Beside its antidiuretic activity, amiloride is a classical uPA inhibitor of weak potency but is oral available and of surprising selectivity. Amiloride binds to uPA with a binding constant of Ki  5.3 mM, whereas tPA and other serine proteases are not inhibited (Vassalli & Belin, 1987), despite the high level of similarity of uPA and tPA around the S1 speci®city pocket. A projection of the amiloride structure is shown in Figure 3(b), and a close up of the uPA active site with bound amiloride in Figure 4(b). Amiloride binds with its guanidino group into the S1 pocket, resembling the binding mode of arginine-based inhibitors, as shown by several serine protease complex structures. The guanidinium group is hydrogen bonded to the water molecule S9 and forms the characteristic canonical salt bridge with Asp189. Interestingly the chlorine atom in amiloride interacts with amino acid resi-

dues Gln192, Gly219, Gly216 and Cys220. The primary interaction of the chlorine atom is with the disulphide group, but also some productive interactions with the p-electrons of the glycine carbonyl groups are formed. All these residues, together with the side-chain of Gln192, form a small hydrophobic side pocket of the primary binding pocket and de®ne a new subsite (S1sub) that might be

employed for inhibitor design. The difference in binding energy of amiloride to uPA and tPA cannot be fully explained. One reason might be Ser190, which forms two hydrogen bonds to amiloride and is an alanine in tPA. However, this cannot be the explanation for its inability to inhibit trypsin, since it contains a serine residue at position 190. A superposition of the structures shows

Ê a slight reorientation of 0.5 A in the upper part of the speci®city pocket of bc-uPA in comparison to tPA, which brings the disulphide bridge with Cys220 closer to the chlorine in amiloride. Small reorientations might explain the difference in binding energy between tPA and uPA but it remains speculative if tPA is unable to perform this reorientation. Towards structure-based inhibitor design With the successful solution of the bc-uPA/UKI1D complex structure we proved the design of a soakable crystal form of the uPA catalytic domain. These crystals have already been made available to a group engaged in a uPA inhibitor design program and resulted in the structure solution of the lead compound WX293T in complex with bc-uPA (Sperl et al., 2000) (Figures 3(c) and 4(c)). A superposition of the low molecular mass inhibitors, whose binding mode has been solved in complex with uPA is shown in Figure 5. EGR-cmk (Spraggon et al., 1995), amiloride and WX293T bind to the speci®city pocket of urokinase but recognise different subsites. EGR-cmk resembles the binding mode of peptidic substrates with the arginine moiety binding to the S1 pocket. The glycine binds into the S2 and the glutamate into the S3 pocket. Amiloride binds in a similar way with its guanidino group into the S1 pocket, like arginine in the EGR-cmk, but its chlorine substituent employs the newly identi®ed subsite S1sub. Finally, the complex structure of bc-uPA with WX293T shows unexpectedly that another binding site, namely the S1-prime (S1H ) site, is accessible to small molecular mass compounds in combination with employment of the speci®city pocket S1. In this binding mode the active-site serine residue rotates by 60  towards His57, which in turn is displaced outwards. Hence, this concerted movement gives way for the unexpected binding of WX293T

towards the S1H site. The goal of structure-based ligand design is now not only to optimise further the binding of the inhibitors to their respective subsites, but also to combine the successful functionalities of the different inhibitors in a single molecule.

Material and Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length cDNA of uPA (kindly provided by Viktor Magdolen) (primers: 5H -aaa aaa cca tgg ctc agt gtg gcc aaa ag-3H and 5H -cct cag atc taa gct tca gag ggc cag gcc-3H , the introduced restriction sites are underlined and the start and stop codon are indicated in bold) yielded a sequence coding for the uPA catalytic domain with the arti®cially introduced start sequence MAQCG (C corresponding to Cys1 in the chymotrypsinogen numbering scheme) and the natural C terminus of the sequence. The introduced endonuclease restriction sites NcoI and HindIII were used to ligate this construct into the pET 21d (Novagen, Germany) expression plasmid. Transformation of the plasmid into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Grodberg & Dunn, 1988) containing the pLysS helper plasmid (Studier, 1991) yielded uPA expression in inclusion bodies as con®rmed by N-terminal sequencing. In a second step the mutation of Cys122 to Ser (C122S) was introduced in a temperature cycle by employing the primer 5H -cag-acc-atc-tcc-ctg-ccc-tcg-atg-3H and its complementary primer which introduced the exchange of tgc (Cys) for tcc (Ser). Afterwards the original plasmid was destroyed by DpnI digestion (ExSite mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, Germany). Expression of the resulting plasmid in BL21/DE3 pLysS yielded large amounts of the mutated human uPA catalytic domain in inclusion bodies. Refolding, puri®cation and activation of uPA C122S was carried out by adapting the protocols by Winkler & Blaber (1986). After induction of the expression with 1 mM IPTG at A600  1.0 and further cultivation at 37  C for four hours, the cells were harvested in soni®cation buffer (30 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 0.02 % (w/v) sodium azide (pH 7.8)), incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with lysozyme and soni®ed. The inclusion bodies were puri®ed by repeated resuspension using a Dounce hom-

474
ogeniser in soni®cation buffer containing 0.5 % (w/v) LDAO. The puri®ed inclusion bodies were dissolved to a protein concentration of 50 mg/ml in 6 M guanidinium chloride, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM DTT and insolubilities were removed by centrifugation. Refolding was achieved by rapid dilution with 1 ml of the inclusion body solution added dropwise with stirring to one litre of refolding buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, 1.3 M guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.002 % (v/v) Tween 20, 4 mM reduced glutathione, 0.02 mM oxidised glutathione (pH 8.0) at 4  C). The mixture was stirred for ten days until the concentration of free thiol groups had dropped to below 1 mM, as judged by Ellman's test (Ellman, 1959). The solution was concentrated by ultra®ltration before it was dialysed against activation buffer (50 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). To a solution of 1 mg/ml uPA C122S in activation buffer 1 ml of Plasmin suspension (Roche, Germany) was added. After incubation for four hours at 37  C the solution was passed through a benzamidine agarose column (Sigma, Germany), inactive uPA was washed out and the bchain of urokinase (bc uPA) was eluted with 1 mM benzamidine in activation buffer. The peak fractions were pooled and subjected to gel ®ltration on a Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia, Germany). uPA-containing fractions were concentrated and applied to a desalting column to exchange the buffer for crystallisation buffer (10 mM NaCl, 2 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0)). Crystallisation screens were carried out on an automated pipetting workstation (Crybot 3000; Qiagen, Germany) employing the vapour diffusion method with hanging drops. The bc-uPA solution (15 mg/ml) was mixed with the reservoir solution. All crystals were initially grown in solutions containing benzamidine, which was later replaced for the desired inhibitor. Single crystals were placed in 5 ml drops of harvesting solution (1.25 M Li2SO4, 1 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.125 M sodium citrate-HCl (pH 5.2)) containing a suspension of the inhibitor. By replacing the buffer daily the benzamidine was slowly exchanged for the new component. Soaked crystals with dimensions of up to 100 mm Â 80 mm Â 250 mm were mounted on a rotating anode generator (Rigaku, Japan) operated at 50 kV and 80 mA, equipped with an image plate detector (Mar Research, Germany). Crystals diffracted up to a limiting resolution Ê of 1.8 A and complete data sets were integrated, scaled and reduced using routines from the CCP4 program package (Bailey, 1994) (Table 1). The uPA structure reported by Spraggon et al. (1995) was directly used in molecular replacement trials employing AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The inhibitors were built into the electron density with the equilibrium parameters taken from a Sybyl (MSI, Germany) minimised structure of that con®guration. The force constants connected to the parameter set of the inhibitors were set to 10 % of the normal values to allow È CNS (Brunger, 1998), a correction of the estimated equilibrium parameters according to the density. For protein re®nement the usual Engh & Huber (1991) parameter set was taken. The structure was completed in alternating cycles of manual model building with ``O'' (Jones, 1978) and positional re®nement with CNS including an anisotropic B factor re®nement and bulk solvent correction. Water molecules were added into the density when well de®ned Fo À Fc density contoured at 2.5s coincided with 2Fo À Fc density contoured at 1.0s. Finally individual restrained B factors were re®ned, and the weights for the crystallographic R factor and the B factor restraints of bonded atoms were set to values where the Rfree runs
