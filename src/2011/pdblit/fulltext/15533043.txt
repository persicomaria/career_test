ABSTRACT: Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) is the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of creatine biosynthesis. The enzyme is found in abundance in the livers of all vertebrates. The intact GAMT from recombinant rat liver has been crystallized with an inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and a substrate guanidinoacetate (GAA), and with SAH and an inhibitor guanidine (GUN). These ternary complex structures have been determined at 2.0 Å resolution. GAMT has an R/ open-sandwich structure, and the N-terminal section (residues 1-42) covers the active site entrance so that the active site is not visible. SAH has extensive interactions with GAMT through H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The guanidino groups of GAA and GUN form two pairs of H-bonds with E45 and D134, respectively. The carboxylate group of GAA interacts with the backbone amide groups of L170 and T171. A model structure of GAMT containing the two substrates (SAM and GAA) was built by attaching a methyl group (CE) on SD of the bound SAH. On the basis of this model structure, a catalytic mechanism of GAMT is proposed. The active site entrance is opened when the N-terminal section is moved out. GAA and SAM enter the active site and interact with the amino acid residues on the surface of the active site by polar and nonpolar interactions. OD1 of D134 and CE of SAM approach NE of GAA from the tetrahedral directions. The OD1,,,NE and CE,,,NE distances are 2.9 and 2.2 Å, respectively. It is proposed that three slightly negatively charged carbonyl oxygen atoms (O of T135, O of C168, and OB of GAA) around OD1 of D134 increase the pKa of OD1 so that OD1 abstracts the proton on NE. A strong nucleophile is generated on the deprotonated NE of GAA, which abstracts the methyl group (CE) from the positively charged SD of SAM, and creatine (methyl-GAA) and SAH (demethyl-SAM) are produced. E45, D134, and Y221 mutagenesis studies support the proposed mechanism. A mutagenesis study and the inhibitory mechanism of guanidine analogues support the proposed mechanism.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (S-adenosyl-Lmethionine:guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, GAMT,1 EC 2.1.1.2), first found in pig liver by Cantoni and Vignos, is the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of creatine biosynthesis (1). The enzyme is found in abundance in the livers of all vertebrates. In humans, the biosynthesis of creatine is reported to represent 75% of the total utilization of methionine through

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (2), and thus, GAMT is believed to be the major enzyme involved in the metabolic conversion of SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in vertebrates (3). SAH inhibits severely most SAM-dependent methyltransferases, including GAMT (4-8). A hereditary disease with extrapyramidal motor disorder and extremely low concentrations of creatine in the brain, serum, and urine has recently been described (9) and was shown to be due to a deficiency of GAMT in the liver (10, 11). Oral supplementation with 0.35-2.0 g of creatine/kg/day slowly increases the total creatine concentration in the brain (12, 13). GAMT was purified to homogeneity from the livers of pig and rat by Im et al. (14) and Ogawa et al. (15), respectively, and shown to be a monomeric protein with a relatively small molecular size (Mr ) 25 800). The amino acid sequences of the rat (16) and human enzymes (17) were

14386 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 45, 2004 deduced from the respective cDNA sequences. Between the two enzymes, there is 82.5% homology in the nucleotide sequence and 86.9% homology in the amino acid sequence. Rat liver GAMT was produced recombinantly in large amounts in Escherichia coli (16), and its structural and functional features have been studied by chemical modification, site-directed mutagenesis, and limited proteolysis (1823). The 36 amino acid residues at the N-terminus of rat liver GAMT were cleaved during the purification, and the crystal structure of the truncated enzyme was determined at 2.5 Å resolution (24, 25). The truncated enzyme forms a dimer, and each subunit contains one SAH molecule in the active site. R2202 of the partner subunit enters deeply into the active site and forms a pair of H-bonds with D134. The dimer structure of the truncated GAMT looks like a protein arginine methyltransferase (one of the subunits) that forms a complex with a target protein (the other subunit). Since the N-terminally truncated GAMT shows a very weak protein arginine methyltransferase activity, the dimer structure of the truncated enzyme has provided a model structure of protein arginine methyltransferases (24). A secondary structure prediction by the PSA server (26) suggested that the truncated N-terminal section would form a long R-helix (residues 10-27) and a -strand (residues 31-35). A ternary complex structure of the intact GAMT was built on the basis of the N-terminally truncated structure and the secondary structure prediction, and a possible catalytic mechanism was proposed (24). In the model, GAA3 binds to the active site in a manner similar to that of R220 and the carboxylate group of GAA forms a pair of H-bonds with R20. However, later, we found that the R20A mutation did not affect the catalytic activity (unpublished data), indicating that an intact GAMT model structure and the proposed mechanism had some problems. Here we present the crystal structures of intact GAMT ternary complexes [GAMT-(SAH + GAA) and GAMT(SAH + GUN)]. On the basis of these ternary complex structures, we propose a catalytic mechanism of the methyl transfer reaction by GAMT. A mutagenesis study and the inhibitory mechanism of guanidine analogues support the proposed mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification and Crystallization Procedures. GAMT used in this study is the recombinant rat enzyme produced in E. coli JM109 transformed with the pUCGAT9-1 plasmid that contains the coding sequence of rat GAMT cDNA (16). The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from E. coli extracts by gel filtration over Sephacryl S-200 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously (27). A cocktail of protease inhibitors (from Sigma) was used to prevent proteolysis, and the intact enzyme was purified. Recombinant

Komoto et al. GAMT lacks the N-terminal acetyl group but exhibits kinetic parameters similar to those of the liver enzyme (15, 16). The hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method was employed for crystallization of the enzyme. The initial crystallization condition was found by a crystallization screening procedure. Crystals of GAMT-(SAH + GAA) were grown in a solution containing 8 mg/mL GAMT, 1 mM SAH, 2 mM GAA, 0.25 M sodium chloride, 5 mM tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 24-26% PEG 8000, and 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0) in a 4 °C cold room. Prismatic crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies (0.20 mm × 0.15 mm × 0.15 mm) were grown in 2 weeks. Crystals containing SAH and guanidine (GUN) [GAMT-(SAH + GUN)] were grown in a solution containing 10 mg/mL GAMT, 2 mM SAH, 10 mM guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 5 mM TCEP, 2028% PEG 8000, and 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.5) in a 4 °C cold room. Prismatic crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies (0.20 mm × 0.15 mm × 0.15 mm) were grown in 2 weeks. Data Measurement. The crystals of GAMT-(SAH + GAA) and GAMT-(SAH + GUN) in a hanging drop were scooped with a nylon loop and dipped into a cryoprotectant solution for 15 min, respectively, before they were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cryoprotectant solution was composed of the original mother liquor containing 15% ethylene glycol. The frozen crystals were transferred onto a Rigaku RAXIS IIc imaging plate X-ray diffractometer with a rotating anode X-ray generator as an X-ray source (Cu KR radiation operated at 50 kV and 100 mA). The X-ray beam was focused to 0.3 mm by confocal optics (Osmic, Inc.). The diffraction data were measured up to 2.0 Å resolution at -180 °C. The data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (28). The data statistics are given in Table 1. Crystal Structure Determination. The deduced unit cell dimensions of GAMT-(SAH + GAA) and GAMT-(SAM + GUN) indicate that these crystals are isomorphous to each other. The unit cell dimensions and space group (P1) indicate that the unit cell contains one complex. The crystal structure of the GAMT-(SAM + GAA) complex was initially determined by a molecular replacement procedure using the N-terminally truncated GAMT-SAH complex (PDB entry 1KHH). The undefined residues (residues 7-42) in the truncated enzyme were built in 2Fo - Fc maps. Residues 1-6 were apparently disordered and were not included in the model. The model was refined by the simulated annealing procedures of X-PLOR (29). The 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps showed two large significant residual electron density peaks in the active site (Figure 1). A SAH molecule was built in one of the residual electron density peaks. The other residual electron density peak was assigned to GAA. The model was refined with the simulated annealing procedures of X-PLOR. Other well-defined residual peaks were assigned to water molecules. The complex was refined with all data (no  cutoff) at 2.0 Å resolution. The structure of GAMT-(SAH + GUN) was determined using the coordinates of GAMT-(SAM + GAA). The 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps showed that two well-defined residual electron density peaks corresponding to SAH and GUN, and SAH and GUN, were fitted into the residual electron density peaks, respectively. The complex structure was refined with the same procedure that was applied to GAMT-(SAM + GAA). The coordinates have been depos-

ited in the Protein Data Bank (entries 1XCJ and 1XCL, respectively). Site-Directed Mutagenesis. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare cDNAs encoding mutated forms of GAMT. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coraville, IA). Mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel et al. (30), with a Mutan-K site-directed mutagenesis kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). A clone containing the desired mutation was identified by nucleotide sequence analysis across the mutation site by the dideoxy chain termination method (31). Enzyme Assay. The enzyme catalytic activity of GAMT is measured with coupling reactions with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) as shown below:

GAA + SAM 9 creatine + SAH 9 8 8 Hcy + Ado 9 inosine + NH4+ 8
The GAMT catalytic activities of the WT and mutated enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically, as described in a previous study (23). RESULTS OVerall Structure. The crystallographic refinement parameters (Table 1), final 2Fo - Fc maps, and conformational analysis by PROCHECK (32) indicate that the structures of GAMT-(SAH + GAA) and GAMT-(SAH + GUN) have been determined with acceptable statistics. Residues 7-42 which were not defined in the truncated GAMT are welldefined in the intact enzyme structure and are folded into a coil-helix(16-19)-coil-strand(25 and 26)-coil-strand(33-35)-coil-strand(38-42) structure. Residues 1-6 were not defined in the 2Fo - Fc maps and are apparently disordered. The core structure (residues 43-235) is essentially the same as that of the N-terminally truncated

enzyme and is folded into a typical R/ -open sandwich structure seen in all known structures of SAM-dependent methyltransferases (Figure 2A). Since the rmsd of CA positions between GAMT-(SAH + GAA) and GAMT(SAH + GUN) is 0.1 Å, the structure of GAMT-(SAH + GAA) is mainly described in this paper. SAH Binding Site. As shown in Figure 1, well-defined electron density peaks were observed in the active site of GAMT, indicating that the enzymes contain SAH and GAA, and SAH and GUN, respectively. SAH binds to the Cterminal ends of 1 and 4, where the strand order is reversed (Figure 2). The adenine ring is in a hydrophobic pocket and forms two H-bonds (N3,,,N[W116] and N6,,,OE1[E117]) with GAMT and two H-bonds with a water molecule (w5) connecting N6 and N7 to O of Y136 (Figure 3). The consensus H-bonds connect the 2-OH and 3-OH groups of adenosine ribose to acidic amino acid residue E89 located at the C-terminal end of 2 (Figures 2 and 3). The 2-OH and 3-OH groups also participate in H-bonds with NE1[W19] and N[G69], respectively. The carboxyl group of the Hcy moiety is involved in H-bonds with three backbone amide groups (M70, I72, and A73). The amino group of the Hcy moiety participates in H-bonds with OD2[D134], SD[M49], and a water molecule (w4). Since D134 forms a pair of H-bonds with the guanidino group of the bound GAA, SAH and GAA are connected through the D134-mediated Hbonds. Most mammalian non-nucleic acid methyltransferases are monomeric proteins that are rather small in size and share three regions of sequence similarity (motifs I-III from the N-terminal side) (33). The sequence of motif I is glycinerich [oLD(E)oGsGsG, where o and s denote hydrophobic and small neutral amino acid residues, respectively, and 63 VLEVGFGMA71 in GAMT]; motif II is characterized by the presence of a conserved aspartate residue that is surrounded by hydrophobic residues (oDso and 133YDTY136 in GAMT) (34). Motif III has rather well-defined fingerprint

residues [LR(K)PGGxL and 159LKPGGIL165 in GAMT] and has no apparent role in substrate binding and catalysis (35). The three motifs are always found in the same order on the polypeptide chain and are separated by similar intervals. As shown in Figure 3, motifs I and II are indeed involved in substrate binding and catalysis, which will be discussed below. GAA Binding Site. The substrate GAA is firmly attached to the enzyme by H-bonds (Figure 3A). Each carboxylate group of E45 and D134 forms a pair of H-bonds with the guanidino group of GAA. A water molecule (w1) participates

in a bridge H-bond between NH2[GAA] and OG1[T171]. The carboxylate group of GAA forms a pair of H-bonds with the amide groups of L170 and T171. Also, one of the carboxylate oxygens is involved in two additional H-bonds with OG1[T171] and a water molecule (w2). As described above, all polar groups of GAA are involved in H-bonds. GUN Binding Site. GUN binds at the same site of the guanidino group of GAA (Figure 3B). Two water molecules (w1 and w2) bind at the same sites as observed in GAMT(SAH + GAA). In addition to these water molecules, two water molecules (wa and wb) occupy the OA and OB carbonyl

The N-terminal section (residues 7-42) is illustrated by white coil, which is folded into coil-helix(16-19)-coil-strand(25-26)-coil-strand(33-35)-coil-strand(38-42).

oxygen binding site of GAA. Therefore, the H-bonding networks around GUN are quite similar to those around GAA. Model Structure of GAMT Containing SAM and GAA. The GAMT-(SAM + GAA) model structure was built by attaching a methyl group (CE) to SD of the bound SAH in GAMT-(SAH + GAA). The CE position was identified by superimposing SAM in a well-refined structure in the Protein Data Bank [SAM in heat shock protein FtsJ determined at 1.5 Å resolution (36) was used] on the bound SAH in GAMT-(SAH + GAA). In this model structure, the distance between CE of SAM and NE of GAA (CE,,,NE) is 2.2 Å, and the SD-CE,,,NE bonds are nearly linear. SAM has an S-configuration at the SD atom, which is seen in naturally occurring SAM (37, 38). Enzyme ActiVities of the Mutated Enzymes. E45 and D134 are involved in H-bonds with the guanidino group of GAA and apparently play important roles in the catalytic reaction.

These two residues along with Y221 were mutated, and the catalytic activities of the mutated enzymes were compared with that of WT. As shown in Table 2, the E45S and D134A mutations inactivate the enzymes. The D134N mutations reduce the kcat values significantly, while reduction of kcat values by the E45D, E45Q, D134E, and Y221F mutations is relatively small. Changes in the KM(SAM) and KM(GAA) values caused by the E45D and E45Q mutations are relatively small, whereas the D134N and D134E mutations increase the KM(SAM) and KM(GAA) values significantly. All mutations reduce kcat/KM(SAM). The kcat/KM(GAA) values of E45D and E45Q are at the same level as that of WT, while the other mutations reduce kcat/KM(GAA) significantly. Since E45, D134, and Y221 interact with GAA but not SAM in the crystal structure, the large increases in KM(SAM) are mainly due to a change of either the active site geometry or the hydration degree on the active site surface. The kcat/KM(GAA) values will be mainly used for discussion because

mutations of E45, D134, and Y221 are expected to alter these values. GUN Is a Weak Inhibitor. There has been no report about the inhibitor of GAMT except for the general methyltransferase inhibitor SAH. We have examined simple guanidino derivatives (GUN, methyl-GUN, and amino-GUN) to determine whether those compounds are substrates or inhibitors.

These GUN derivatives showed a weak inhibitory activity (IC50 ) 10-100 µM). DISCUSSION Differences between the Intact and Truncated Enzymes. The truncated enzyme that lacks residues 1-36 forms a dimer, in which R220 of one subunit enters deeply the active

site of the other and forms a pair of H-bonds with D134 (Figure 2B). On the other hand, the intact enzyme is a monomer and the polypeptide composed of residues 1-42 covers the active site cleft. As shown in Figure 4, the backbones of the intact and truncated enzymes are superimposable, and the rmsd of CA positions between the intact and truncated enzymes is 0.7 Å. However, several side chains of the amino acid residues located near the GAA binding site are oriented differently (Figure 5). These are R43, E45, M70, Y136, W143, E175, and R220. When the intact enzyme structure is superimposed on the truncated enzyme structure, there are obvious collisions between residues 7-42 of the intact enzyme and the side chains oriented differently in the truncated enzyme, suggesting that the side chains of these amino acid residues are quite movable if the N-terminal section is moved out to open the active site entrance. Such side chain movements would facilitate release of the product from the active site. GAMT Should HaVe at Least Two Conformations. As shown in Figure 2A, the active site of the intact GAMT is not visible because the N-terminal section (residues 1-42) covers the active site cleft (closed conformation). For the

substrates to enter the active site and to release the products from the active site, the N-terminal section has to move out to open the active site entrance (open conformation). In the closed conformation, there are 14 H-bonds and 7 watermediated H-bonds between the N-terminal and core sections. The number of H-bonds is relatively small, suggesting that the N-terminal section is readily separated from the core section. For example, the bound SAH and GAA have 14 and 9 H-bonds, respectively. Obviously, when the active site entrance is opened, water molecules can flow into the active site along with the substrates. For the catalytic reaction to occur, it is necessary to exclude unnecessary water molecules from the active site. The role of the N-terminal section could be to exclude water molecules from the active site. Indeed, the N-terminally truncated enzyme has the intact active site but does not have the GAMT catalytic activity. Proposed Catalytic Mechanism. On the basis of the crystal structure of GAMT-(SAH + GAA) and the model structure of GAMT-(SAM + GAA), a possible catalytic mechanism of the methyl transfer reaction of GAMT is proposed. Brownian motion moves the N-terminal section to open the active site entrance. SAM and GAA molecules enter and

FIGURE 8: Proposed mechanism of the methyl transfer reaction of GAMT. (A) Transition stage in which NE of GAA has sp3 hybridization. The three slightly negatively charged carbonyl oxygens (O of T135, O of C168, and OB of GAA) increase the pKa value of OD1 so that OD1 abstracts the proton on NE of GAA. A strong nucleophile is generated on the deprotonated NE of GAA, which abstracts the methyl group (CE) from the positively charged SD of SAM. E45 and Y221 participate in building the active site framework. (B) Postreaction stage. The methylated NE goes back to the sp2 hybridization so that the bulky methyl group breaks a pair of H-bonds with D134, and the products creatine and then SAH are released from the active site. A water molecule occupies the OB binding site; OD1 releases the proton, and the pKa value goes back to a normal level. Curved arrows denote the movements of electron pairs. Possible polar interactions are illustrated with dashed lines. The plus and minus signs indicate positive and negative charge, respectively. Straight arrows denote O,,,O interactions between three carbonyl oxygens (O[T135], O[C168], and OB[GAA]) and OD1[D134].

bind to the SAM and GAA binding sites, respectively, as seen in the crystal structure. SAM and GAA are firmly attached in the active site by H-bonds (Figure 3A). The N-terminal section moves back to the closed conformation position, and thus, unbound water molecules are excluded from the active site. There are two characteristic features at this stage. (1) OD1[D134] and CE[SAM] approach NE of GAA from the tetrahedral directions. The NE,,,OD1 and NE,,,CE distances are 2.9 and 2.2 Å, respectively, and the SD-CE,,,NE bonds are nearly linear (Figure 6A). (2) OD1 of D134 forms a H-bond with NE of GAA and is surrounded by three slightly negatively charged carbonyl oxygens (OB[GAA], O[T135], and O[C168]), all within 3.5 Å (Figure 7A). In this environment, the pKa value of OD1 should be relatively high. As illustrated in Figure 8, the following events occur. (1) The negatively charged OD1 of D134 interacts with the hydrogen attached to NE of GAA so that the hydrogen is displaced from the sp2 hybridization plane and is tilted toward the oxygen (Figure 6A). The electron configuration at NE then approaches sp3 hybridization, and the lone pair electrons are pointed toward the CE atom of SAM. Since the OD1 environment increases the pKa value, OD1 abstracts the proton on NE of GAA. The deprotonated NE of GAA could be a strong nucleophile, which abstracts the methyl group (CE) on the positively charged SD of SAM. Specifically, a pair of electrons shift from OD1- of D134 to SD+ of SAM as illustrated in Figure 8. The H-OD1 and NZ-CE

bonds are formed, while the NZ-H and CE-SD bonds are cleaved. The methyl group of SAM is transferred to NE of GAA by an SN2 reaction mechanism. (2) Since the methylated NE goes back to the sp2 hybridization, the product creatine breaks a pair of H-bonds with D134 and is released from the active site (Figure 6B). Brownian motion moves the N-terminal section to open the active site entrance, and the product creatine followed by the demethylated SAM (SAH) leaves the active site. D134 releases a proton to solvent because its pKa value decreases to normal. The E45, D134, and Y221 Mutation Data Support the Proposed Mechanism. Since E45 and D134 participate in a pair of H-bonds with the guanidino group of GAA, mutations of these residues are expected to affect the catalytic activity. As shown in Table 2, the E45S, D134N, and D134A mutations reduce the kcat values drastically. As will be described below, the E45S mutation would induce conformational changes in the active site, and subsequently, the substrate binding is inhibited. In the proposed catalytic mechanism, D134 participates not only in the substrate binding but also in the catalytic reaction as a general base. Since the D134A and D134N mutant enzymes cannot abstract the proton on NE of GAA, the kcat values are reduced drastically. The D134E mutation should increase KM(GAA) because it would disrupt the GAA binding by changing the active site surface. However, since the D134E mutant enzyme could abstract the proton on NE of GAA, it has a considerably large kcat value. Interestingly, the conservative mutations (E45Q and E45D) of E45 do not reduce the kcat and kcat/KM(GAA) values drastically, but a nonconservative mutation (E45S) inactivates the enzyme. Since in the crystal structure the guanidino group of GAA is bound to the enzyme firmly by five H-bonds, it might not be critical for substrate binding if one or two H-bonds are broken. Indeed, E45 does not form a pair of

Catalytic Mechanism of Guanidinoacetate Methyltransferases H-bonds with the guanidino group of Arg220 in the truncated structure. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the E45Q and E45D mutant enzymes retain their considerable catalytic activity. There must be a completely different reason for the fact that the E45S mutation abolishes catalytic activity. The carboxylate group of E45 forms a H-bond with OH of Y221 in the crystal structures of the intact and truncated enzymes. The hydroxyphenyl group of Y221 is located on the active site surface and appears to be a wall of the active site. When E45 is replaced with a short side chain Ser, the H-bond connecting to the two residues is no longer present. The hydroxyphenyl group of Y221 could move freely, move into the GAA binding site, and prevent the GAA binding. To prove this hypothesis, the Y221F mutant enzyme was made, and the catalytic activity was determined. As expected, the Y221F mutation increases KM by 500-fold but does not affect kcat. Therefore, E45 and Y221 appear to have structural roles in building the active site framework. Why Is GUN Not a Substrate of GAMT? Since GUN binds at the same site of the guanidino group of GAA in the crystal structure, GUN can be a substrate of GAMT and receive a methyl group from SAM. However, GUN, methyl-GUN, and amino-GUN are all weak inhibitors of GAMT. In the proposed catalytic mechanism, the pKa value of OD1[D134] is increased by the slightly negatively charged carbonyl oxygens (O[T135], O[C168], and OB[GAA]), and thus, it can abstract the proton on NE of GAA. In an inhibitor complex [GAMT-(SAH + GUN)], OD1[D134] is surrounded by two carbonyl oxygens (O[T135] and O[C168]) and a water molecule (wb) located at the OB binding site of the GAA carboxylate (Figures 3B and 7B). OD1 forms a H-bond with the water molecule. In this environment, the pKa value of OD1 would not be high enough to abstract the proton on NE of GUN. Therefore, GUN is an inhibitor but not a substrate. Similarly, methyl-GUN and amino-GUN bind at the same site of GUN and inhibit GAA binding. It is noted that such a water molecule (wb) is not observed in the N-terminally truncated enzyme structure. The inhibitory activity of simple guanidine analogues supports the proposed mechanism in which the pKa value of OD1[D134] is increased by OB[GAA]. However, it is necessary to prove that carbonyl groups of both T135 and C168 are involved in the OD1[D134] activation. As shown in Figure 7A, OD1[D134] sits on three oxygen atoms (O[T135], O[C168], and OB[GAA]). If one of the carbonyl oxygen sites were empty, OD1 would be shifted toward the empty site to prevent the charge-charge repulsion from OB[GAA] and the other carbonyl oxygen. In the higher-pKa environment (Figure 7A), the two carbonyl oxygens are within 3.5 Å of OD1. On the other hand, O[C168] moves away from OD1 in the lower-pKa environment (Figure 7B). The differences in environment around OD1[D134] in GAMT-(SAH + GAA) and GAMT-(SAH + GUN) suggest that two carbonyl oxygens adjacent to OD1[D134] are essential to increasing the pKa value of OD1. Mutation of T135 or C168 might alter the position of the invoked carbonyl enough to prove that indeed T135 or C168 is important for the early stage of the mechanism. However, since the conformation changes in the main chain must alter the positions of side chains, it would be difficult to obtain conclusive evidence by a mutagenesis approach.
