The crystal structure of the tetrameric glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase from the yeast Saccharomyces Ê cerevisiae has been determined to 1.7 A resolution in complex with the sugar substrate. The difference map indicates that Ê 3-phosphoglycerate is bound at the base of a 12 A cleft, Ê of the primary positioning C2 of the substrate within 3.5 A catalytic residue, histidine 8.

1. Introduction
Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoglycerate mutase (ScPGM) is a homotetrameric enzyme with a subunit Mr of 27 kDa which reversibly catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from C3 of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) to C2 of 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG; Fothergill-Gilmore & Watson, 1989). The Ê structure of ScPGM was originally solved at 3.5 A resolution Ê (Campbell et al., 1974). Further studies at 2.8 A (Winn et al., 1981) positioned 3PG in the active site; however, this resolution did not allow accurate placement of the active-site residues, notably of the two active-site histidines His8 and His181. Ê The structure of native ScPGM has been described to 2.3 A resolution and the errors in the sequence corrected (Rigden et Ê al., 1998). The 2.3 A structure was solved in a different, although related, space group from that described here and Ê did not contain the enzyme substrate. More recently, a 2.12 A structure has been solved, again in a different space group (Rigden et al., 1999). For ScPGM to be catalytically competent His8 must be phosphorylated, which requires trace amounts of the cofactor 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) to be present in vivo (Nairn et al., 1995). Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that replacing either of the active-site histidines (His8 and His181) with alanine dramatically reduces ScPGM isomerase activity by preventing the formation of the phosphohistidine moiety (White & Fothergill-Gilmore, 1992). Mutation of important active-site residues Ser11, Glu15, Gly21, Ala60 and Arg87 changes the af®nity and speci®city of ScPGM for 3PG (Ravel et al., 1996). Close to the active-site entrance lies the C-terminal region of approximately 14 residues, whose atomic coordinates have not been included in any of the ®ve structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977; PDB codes 3pgm, 1bq3, 1bq4, 4pgm and 5pgm), since its presumed high ¯exibility leads to poorly de®ned electron density. This C-terminal structure appears to be crucial in the reaction mechanism for regulating substrate release and providing a suitable environment for phosphate transfer, since mutations in this region reduce catalytic activity (Garel et al., 1989). The ScPGM structure presented in this paper allows accurate positioning

2. Experimental
ScPGM was puri®ed from bakers' yeast by a modi®cation of the method described by Winn et al. (1981). Bakers' yeast, S. cerevisiae, was broken by grinding with acid-washed beads, resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.0 and clari®ed before adding ammonium sulfate (enzyme grade) to 30%. After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a ®nal concentration of 75%. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.0 and dialysed against this buffer. Cation-exchange chromatography was performed using CM cellulose (Whatman) in Tris±HCl buffer at pH 7.0 with a 0.1±1.0 M NaCl gradient. A ®nal gel®ltration step using Superose 12 (Pharmacia) in 20 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.0, 5% ammonium sulfate resulted in protein of suf®cient purity for crystallization trials. All operations were carried out at 277 K. Crystals of ScPGM were grown from 55% ammonium sulfate in 10 mM imidazole buffer pH 6.8 in the presence of 1 mM 3PG substrate using the hanging-drop technique at 277 K. The concentration of protein used was 10 mg mlÀ1. Crystals were harvested into a mother liquor composed of 65% ammonium sulfate, 10 mM imidazole buffer

pH 6.8 and 1 mM 3PG and were stored at 277 K until use. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature to Ê 1.7 A on beamline 9.6 at the Daresbury Synchrotron source using a MAR Research image-plate detector. Data were processed in space group C2 using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997), with resultant unit-cell Ê parameters a = 96.15, b = 85.8, c = 81.9 A,  = 120.5 . A total of 95 787 measured re¯ections were merged to give Ê 42 944 unique re¯ections to 1.7 A. To increase the completeÊ ness at low resolution, `in-house' 2.8 A data collected on a Siemens multiwire detector with Cu K radiation (Winn et al., 1981) were scaled and merged with the synchrotron data with an overall merging R factor of 8.9% using BLANC (Vagin et al., 1998). A total of 3754 re¯ections were added to give 96.5% Ê completeness to 3.3 A (cumulative completeness of 82.5 to Ê ; Fig. 1). Re®nement of the ScPGM starting model was 1.7 A carried out using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) on 44 341 re¯ections with anisotropic data correction. The 3PG substrate coordinates were obtained from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (Allen, 1998). After inclusion of the substrate, further re®nement was carried out using occupancies of 0.4 for 3PG and 0.6 for the overlaid sulfate molecule. To determine these ®gures, the occupancies were adjusted until the B factors for the phosphate and overlaid sulfate moiety were comparable with the B factors of the remaining constituent atoms of the sugar substrate moiety. The model was rebuilt in O (Jones et al., 1991) using both 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc difference maps. Water molecules were added using ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993). 3PG and sulfate molecules were added where the electron density suggested their inclusion.

The re®ned model contains two ScPGM the model with 3PG included improved the electron density surrounding the substrate and decreased Rfree, indicating that the 3PG was favourably positioned.

Ê of a 12 Â 9 A cleft and parallel to Asn14, with which it forms Ê hydrogen bonds (Table 4). C1 of the 3PG is within 3.5 A of His8. Hydrogen bonds to Arg7 and Arg59 also act to hold 3PG in place. Fig. 4 shows the electron density surrounding 3PG after re®nement. The short half-life of phosphorylated ScPGM (Nairn et al., 1995) explains why no phosphate group is observed covalently bonded to His8, making this the crystallographic structure of a catalytically incompetent ScPGM. Suf®cient volume exists between His8 and 3PG to accommodate the phosphate moiety in the active site in a favourable position for reaction with 3PG. It is also likely that reorientation of the 2,3-BPG intermediate in the active site (Fothergill-Gilmore & Watson, 1989) is a possibility, since suf®cient volume, occupied in this structure by ordered water molecules, exists around the substrate to allow this to occur.

² As referred to in text.

3PG is held ®rmly in place by a network of hydrogen bonds from basic residues lining the active-site cleft to the phosphate-group and carbonyl-group O atoms as well as some hydrophobic interaction between Gln10 and the C3 of 3PG. The carbonyl group is also the most highly exposed to solvent at the entrance to the active site. Ordered water molecules with suitable B factors occupy part of the active site at Ê distances of 2.7±3.3 A from other possible hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors. The network of hydrogen bonds formed by these water molecules (Fig. 5) and active-site residues Ser11, Asn14 and Thr20 aid in positioning of the substrate. The presence of bound 3PG does not appear to induce signi®cant alterations in the structure of the active site of Ê ScPGM when compared with the native 2.3 A structure.

The 3PG and the sulfate have partial occupancies of most recently published phosphoglycerate mutase structure 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. Figure drawn using O-PLOT (Jones et al., 1991). (Rigden et al., 1999) describes the presence of two sulfate anions in the active site, one of which (S1) appears to correspond to the phosphate moiety of bound 3PG in ScPGM. The binding of the 3PG substrate would, therefore, appear to prevent the binding of a sulfate in this position. The second sulfate anion described here occupies a slightly different position to the S2 sulfate anion described by Rigden et al. (1999). The hydrogen-bonding distances holding this sulfate in place are described in Table 4. It is probable that the binding pattern of this second sulfate is altered by the presence of bound substrate.

imposes well (r.m.s.d. of 0.4) with the ScPGM±3PG complex. This lack of observable conformational change of the activesite cleft on substrate binding suggests strongly that most crucial conformational changes involve the labile C-terminal region. The substrate-binding information provided in this structure should enable the design and modelling into the active site of inhibitors and putative drugs. The highresolution positioning of active-site components should also help facilitate the interpretation of kinetic experiments which have been carried out to date. Coordinates of the ScPGM±3PG complex have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank.

icantly alter hydrogen-bonding patterns. It is dif®cult to ascertain whether these changes are a consequence of the presence of the substrate affecting hydrogen-bonding networks or are simply because of the difference in resolution of the data collected. The highly labile C-terminal amino acids beyond residues 234±235 were built into density close to the entrance to the active-site cleft (Fig. 6). Residues up to and including Val240 have been added to the model; however, further interpretation would have led to ambiguous results. The C-terminal tail partially covers the active site, con®rming the theory that it constitutes a `lid' or `cap' to cover the active site during phosphate transfer. Interestingly, the main-chain O atom of Val240 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the catalytically important Arg113. In this structure, the initial part of this C-terminal tail can be seen; however, the electron density becomes uninterpretable after residue 240 in each subunit and there is no unassigned density present in or on the model to suggest an `anchor site' for any residues from 240 to 246. The exposed carbonyl group of 3PG probably forms hydrogen bonds to the mobile C-terminal region to stabilize the `cap' formation. Also of interest in the active site is the hydrogen-bond system Gly9 OÁ Á ÁHis181 ND1, His181 NE2Á Á ÁHis8 NE2, His8 ND1Á Á ÁSer55 OG, with hydrogen bonds of lengths 2.84, Ê 2.79 and 2.86 A, respectively. This system could act as a charge-transfer unit integral to the catalytic reaction and can be assumed to be in a conformation which would allow rephosphorylation of His8 and, therefore, the reactivation of the enzyme. This observed system may be a rigid conformation which prevents the two His side chains from ¯exing, as there is certainly ample volume for movement of both side chains. The presence of a phosphate group attached covalently to His8 would probably disrupt this conformation. Although the native ScPGM structure (Rigden et al., 1998) crystallized from a slightly different space group, it super-
