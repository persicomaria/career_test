Bacterial enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) catalyzes the final step in each cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. Our efforts to identify potent, selective FabI inhibitors began with screening of the GlaxoSmithKline proprietary compound collection, which identified several small-molecule inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus FabI. Through a combination of iterative medicinal chemistry and X-ray crystal structure based design, one of these leads was developed into the novel aminopyridine derivative 9, a low micromolar inhibitor of FabI from S. aureus (IC50 ) 2.4 µM) and Haemophilus influenzae (IC50 ) 4.2 µM). Compound 9 has good in vitro antibacterial activity against several organisms, including S. aureus (MIC ) 0.5 µg/mL), and is effective in vivo in a S. aureus groin abscess infection model in rats. Through FabI overexpressor and macromolecular synthesis studies, the mode of action of 9 has been confirmed to be inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis via inhibition of FabI. Taken together, these results support FabI as a valid antibacterial target and demonstrate the potential of small-molecule FabI inhibitors for the treatment of bacterial infections.
Introduction The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is a serious health problem worldwide.1-4 Certain infections that were previously treatable with standard antibiotic therapies can now be caused by multidrug-resistant organisms that are no longer susceptible to conventional treatment. For example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are major concerns in hospital settings, and multidrug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria gonorrheae, and Escherichia coli plague the community. One approach to combating antibiotic resistance is to identify new drugs that function through novel mechanisms of action. In this regard, bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) is an attractive antibacterial target.5 Bacterial FAS is an essential process by which organisms make fatty acids for use in the assembly of important cellular components, including phospholipids, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, mycolic acids, and the cell envelope. Since FAS is organized differently in bacteria and mammals, there is good potential for selective inhibition of the bacterial system. In bacteria, each reaction involved in FAS is catalyzed by a discrete monofunctional enzyme (the fatty acid synthase II, or FAS II, system; see Figure 1), whereas in mammals, all of the enzymatic activities involved in FAS are encoded on one or two polypeptide chains (the FAS I system).

The final step in each cycle of bacterial FAS is catalyzed by an enoyl-ACP reductase, which mediates the 1,4-reduction of an enoyl-ACP to the corresponding acyl-ACP and drives each cycle of FAS to completion.5,6 Until recently, FabI was believed to be the unique enoylACP reductase in bacteria.5,7 FabI is a monofunctional, NADH- or NADPH-dependent enzyme8,9 that has been shown to be the antibacterial target of the diazaborines10,11 as well as triclosan,12-16 a widely used antibacterial agent that is added to a variety of consumer products including toothpastes, mouthwashes, and hand soap. Although early studies seemed to suggest that FabI might be essential in all bacteria, an alternative triclosan-resistant enoyl-ACP reductase, termed FabK, has recently been identified in several organisms.7 FabK, a flavoprotein, is the sole enoyl-ACP reductase in S. pneumoniae and occurs together with FabI in key

pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A third enoyl-ACP reductase, termed FabL, occurs together with FabI in Bacillus subtilis.17 Consequently, a pure FabI or FabK inhibitor is expected to be a narrow-spectrum agent that targets a few organisms, or possibly even a single organism, while an inhibitor of both FabI and FabK is expected to have broader-spectrum activity. In certain circumstances, the use of narrow-spectrum agents may offer advantages over broad-spectrum agents.2,3 Inhibitors of FabI might also have utility in the treatment of malaria,18-21 since triclosan has recently been shown to inhibit the enoylACP reductase of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Our approach to the identification of small-molecule FabI inhibitors began with screening of the GlaxoSmithKline proprietary compound collection to identify novel lead compounds that inhibit S. aureus FabI. Optimization of these screening leads involved a combination of iterative medicinal chemistry as well as X-ray crystal structure based design. We previously reported the transformation of two of these leads into potent FabI inhibitors with good antibacterial activity against S. aureus.22,23 In the present report, we describe our investigation of a third lead, benzodiazepine 1, which led to the identification of a novel aminopyridinebased FabI inhibitor with good antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Chemistry The 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives 2-4 were prepared according to the general literature procedures for the synthesis of related 1,4-benzodiazepines.24,25 The synthesis of compound 4 illustrates the method (Scheme 1). Commercially available 4-fluoro-3-methylphenylmagnesium bromide (15) reacted with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate to give the tert-butyl benzoate 16. Reaction of 16 with NBS gave the benzylic bromide 17, which, without purification, was converted to benzylic amine 18 by reaction with aqueous methylamine. Acylation of 18 with N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)glycine in the presence of DCC and HOBt afforded 19. Hydrogenolysis of the Cbz protecting group gave 20, which cyclized in hot DMSO to afford the benzodiazepine 21. Deprotection of the tert-butyl ester under acidic conditions gave the corresponding carboxylic acid (22), which was coupled

with 1-methyl-2-(methylaminomethyl)indole (23; prepared by reductive amination of commercially available 1-methylindole-2-carboxaldehyde) in the presence of EDC and HOBt to afford the target compound 4. The related compounds 2 and 3 were prepared by coupling 23 to the corresponding known24,25 (R)- and (S)-benzodiazepine-7-carboxylic acid derivatives. The benzamide derivatives 5-8 were prepared either by standard methods or as illustrated in Schemes 2 and 3. The synthesis of 5 began with esterification26 of 3-methyl-4-nitrobenzoic acid (24) to afford tert-butyl ester 25. Benzylic bromination gave the corresponding crude benzylic bromide 26,27 which reacted with aqueous methylamine in THF to give the benzylic amine 27. Acylation with acetic anhydride gave 28, which on hydrogenation gave 29. Cleavage of the tert-butyl ester under standard acidic conditions, followed by coupling with 1-methyl-2-(methylaminomethyl)indole (23), gave compound 5. The related benzamide derivative 6 was prepared similarly, as illustrated in Scheme 3, and the benzamides 7 and 8 were prepared by coupling 23 with commercially available carboxylic acids. The aminopyridine derivatives and related analogues were prepared either by standard methods or as described in Scheme 4. Commercially available 2-amino5-bromopyridine (34a) or 2-amino-5-bromopyrimidine (34b) was reacted with benzyl acrylate in a Heck-type reaction28 to afford the acrylate esters 35a and 35b, respectively. These were saponified to provide acids 36a and 36b, which were coupled with 23 to give 9 and 10, respectively. Alternatively, for the synthesis of 9, a Heck reaction of 34a with acrylic acid provided 36a directly. For the synthesis of 11, the olefin of 35a was reduced with magnesium metal in methanol, and the resulting mixture of benzyl and methyl esters 37 was saponified. The resulting carboxylic acid 38 was coupled with 23 to give 11. The aminonicotinamide derivative 12 and

the acrylate derivatives 13 and 14 were prepared by coupling 23 with commercially available carboxylic acids. Results and Discussion Screening of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) proprietary compound collection identified the 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative 1 (Table 1) as a low micromolar inhibitor of FabI from S. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (IC50 ) 16.5 and 6.9 µM, respectively). However, 1 does not appreciably inhibit S. pneumoniae FabK (IC50 > 30 µM) and has poor antibacterial activity, with MIC ) 32 µg/ mL against Moraxella catarrhalis and MIC > 64 µg/ mL against S. aureus, E. coli AcrAB- (an efflux mutant), H. influenzae, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae. Nevertheless, we pursued this lead with the expectation that antibacterial activity might improve as potency against the target improved. Evaluation of several derivatives structurally related to 1 revealed the importance of the indole, or an appropriate, lipophilic bioisostere thereof, to FabI activity. For example, 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives wherein the indole group is replaced with phenyl, 2-quinoline, 2-benzoxazole, 2-benzothiazole, or 2-benzimidazole are all much weaker inhibitors of S. aureus FabI. However, a 2-naphthalene derivative has activity comparable to that of 1 in the FabI assay (data not shown). Therefore, for the purposes of our initial studies, the indole subunit was maintained as a constant while we focused on the identification of the minimum key pharmacophoric elements within the benzodiazepine subunit. Since 1 is racemic, we prepared the corresponding (R)and (S)-enantiomers and found that the (R)-enantiomer 2 is clearly preferred by FabI. However, when the ester side chain is removed altogether, the resulting compound 4 has activity comparable to that of 2 in the FabI assays and now has modest antibacterial activity against S. aureus (MIC ) 16 µg/mL). These results show that the ester side chain of 2 is not a key pharmacophoric element for inhibition of FabI. None of these benzodi-

azepine derivatives appreciably inhibits S. pneumoniae FabK (IC50 > 30 µM). The importance of the benzodiazepine ring was explored through an investigation into ring-opened variants of 4. The trisubstituted benzamide derivative 5 maintains FabI inhibitory activity as well as antibacterial activity against S. aureus, indicating that the sevenmembered ring of 4 is not necessary for activity. Further simplification by removal of the amino group from 5 to give derivative 6 causes a substantial decrease in activity. In contrast, removal of the acetylamino side chain of 5 to give the p-aminobenzamide derivative 7 causes only a modest decrease in activity against S. aureus FabI, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus is maintained. These results suggest the importance of the para amino group for FabI inhibition and antibacterial activity. In support of this hypothesis, the simple benzamide derivative 8 is much less active in the FabI assay and has no detectable antibacterial activity up to 64 µg/mL. None of these benzamide derivatives appreciably inhibits S. pneumoniae FabK (IC50 > 30 µM). Since the p-aminobenzamide functionality present in both 5 and 7 appeared to represent the minimum pharmacophore for both FabI inhibitory activity as well as antibacterial activity, we began an investigation of these new leads. As part of this study, we determined the X-ray cocrystal structure of 5 (E. coli FabI IC50 ) 0.52 µM)29 bound to E. coli FabI in the presence of NAD+. The results show that 5 is bound in the active site (Figure 2). The indole subunit binds in a lipophilic pocket and appears to interact with the aryl rings of two tyrosines, Tyr 146 and Tyr 156, and one phenylalanine, Phe 203, from the enzyme. The linking amide exists in a cis conformation and -stacks over the nicotinamide ring of the NAD+ cofactor. The carbonyl of the amide interacts with the hydroxyl of Tyr 156 from the enzyme as well as with the ribose 2-hydroxyl from the cofactor. The 4-amino group is engaged in a hydrogenbonding interaction with one of the phosphate groups of NAD+, and the benzylic amide may interact with the adenine group of NAD+ through a bound water molecule. The mode of binding of 5 appears to be very similar to that of triclosan, a known FabI inhibitor.12-16 In the X-ray cocrystal structure of triclosan bound to E. coli FabI/NAD+,30-33 the phenolic aromatic ring -stacks over the nicotinamide ring of the NAD+ cofactor, with the phenolic hydroxyl involved in hydrogen-bonding

interactions with the hydroxyl of Tyr 156 from the enzyme as well as with the ribose 2-hydroxyl from the cofactor. In support of this binding mode, kinetic studies32-34 have shown that triclosan forms a tight-

binding complex with FabI and NAD+. In the X-ray crystal structure, the phenol subunit of triclosan appears to function as a transition state enolate mimetic, taking the place of the enolate that results from hydride

delivery from the cofactor to the -position of the natural substrate, crotonoyl-ACP (Figure 3). Since the linking amide in 5 is engaged in the same interactions as the phenol of triclosan, we speculate that this amide functions as a mimic of the transition-state enolate.35 The X-ray crystal structure data suggested several interesting possibilities for optimization of 5, but when we began to prepare derivatives in this series, we soon found that these compounds were susceptible to varying degrees of cyclodehydration, and the resultant dihydroquinazoline derivatives (Figure 4) were no longer FabI inhibitors (data not shown). Consequently, we turned our attention to the identification of compounds related to 5 that lacked this undesirable chemical instability. Following consideration of the 5/E. coli FabI/NAD+ crystal structure and the previous SAR, we envisioned replacing the aniline moiety with an aminopyridine (Figure 5). We speculated that the amidine-like arrangement of nitrogens in an aminopyridine might provide a more favorable interaction with the key phosphate oxygen from the cofactor if the aminopyridine were to exist in a protonated form in the enzyme active site. (This turned out not to be the case; see below.) To maximize overlap with 5, the pyridine subunit would be attached to the amide via a two-carbon linker, either saturated or unsaturated, depending on the need for rigidification. This would place the pyridine nitrogen of the new compound in a position similar to that of the aniline nitrogen of 5. The acetylamino side chain of 5 might be mimicked by a substituent at the 3- or 4-position of the aminopyridine, but for simplicity, this substituent was left out of the original design. Compounds 9 and 11 became our initial targets and were prepared as described in Scheme 4. Compound 9 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of FabI from S. aureus (IC50 ) 2.4 µM) and H. influenzae (IC50 ) 4.2 µM), with good antibacterial activity against S. aureus (MIC ) 0.5 µg/mL), M. catarrhalis (MIC ) 4 µg/mL), and the efflux mutant E. coli AcrAB- (MIC ) 8 µg/mL). However, 9 has IC50 > 30 µM against S. pneumoniae FabK and consequently has MIC > 64 µg/mL against the FabK-containing organisms E. faecalis and S. pneumoniae.7 The lack of a detectable MIC against H. influenzae may be due to efflux or poor penetration, since 9 has good activity

against H. influenzae FabI. Importantly, the antibacterial activity of 9 does not appear to be due to a nonspecific cytotoxic or lytic effect (IC50 ) 512 µg/mL in an XTT assay using the human A549 lung cell line; IC50 ) 630 µM in a liposome lysis assay). In addition, 9 has no detectable activity against the human fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme (IC50 > 100 µM). The level of antibacterial activity of 9 against S. aureus (MIC ) 0.5 µg/mL) might appear to be better than expected on the basis of its level of activity against S. aureus FabI (IC50 ) 2.4 µM, apparent Ki ) 0.21 ( 0.11 µM36) and the relationship between IC50 values and MIC values for the other compounds tested. The reasons for this are not entirely clear at this time. However, we are confident that the antibacterial activity is not due to multiple mechanisms of action. Mechanism of action studies, described briefly below and in detail elsewhere,37 suggest that the antibacterial activity of 9 is due to inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis through inhibition of FabI. Furthermore, cytotoxicity studies suggest that the antibacterial activity is not due to a nonspecific cytotoxic effect (see above). Therefore, we speculate that compound 9 might have very good penetration in S. aureus, and this could account for the observed activity level. Alternatively, there is a possibility that FabI is more rate-limiting in S. aureus than in other organisms, thereby rendering S. aureus hypersensitive to FabI inhibitors. Clearly, additional investigation is required to accurately define the nature of the potent antibacterial activity of 9 against S. aureus. A brief further investigation around 9 was conducted in an effort to confirm the key pharmacophore. The corresponding saturated derivative 11 and the compound without the two-carbon linker (12) are both much less potent, demonstrating the importance of the olefin. Derivatives lacking the pyridine nitrogen (13) or the 2-amino group (14) are also much less active, indicating that an intact 2-aminopyridine moiety is important for activity. The 2-aminopyrimidine 10, which maintains the amidine-like character of a 2-aminopyridine, is welltolerated by the enzyme but has lower levels of antibacterial activity. Taken together, these results suggest that an intact 3-(2-aminopyridinyl)acrylamide subunit is the minimum key pharmacophore for FabI activity as well as antibacterial activity. The X-ray cocrystal structure of 9 (E. coli FabI IC50 ) 0.37 µM)29 with E. coli FabI/NAD+ reveals the key binding interactions. The crystal structure shows that 9 is bound in the active site (Figure 6), with the amide and indole subunits making the same contacts as in 5. However, while the aminopyridine subunit of 9 binds in the same general region as the aminoaromatic of 5, it does not bind in the proposed binding mode (Figure 5). Instead of interacting with the phosphate group via hydrogen bonds, the aminopyridine moiety is engaged

in two hydrogen-bonding interactions with Ala 95 from the protein. Presumably, the aminopyridine does not bind as expected because it does not appear to be protonated in the active site. As a result, the proposed bidentate-like interaction with the key phosphate oxygen from the cofactor cannot occur. In fact, the positioning of an unprotonated pyridine nitrogen in the proposed binding model (Figure 5) might be expected to destabilize the interaction with the phosphate oxygen via electrostatic repulsion. However, the unique arrangement of a hydrogen bond acceptor and a hydrogen bond donor present in the neutral aminopyridine species facilitates the observed interaction with a backbone amino acid residue within FabI. These unexpected results reveal an important new binding interaction between E. coli FabI/NAD+ and a small-molecule inhibitor. Consistent with this binding mode, enzymology studies show that 9 is not a substrate for FabI.38 Further biological characterization of 9 is discussed in detail elsewhere.37 Briefly, in mode of action studies, 9 exhibits elevated MICs against a FabI-overexpressing strain of S. aureus,16,37 suggesting that FabI is the primary antibacterial target. In addition, 9 selectively inhibits the incorporation of acetate in macromolecular synthesis (MMS) studies in S. aureus, indicating that the mode of action is via inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis. Taken together, the overexpressor and MMS results suggest that the antibacterial mode of action of 9 is inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis via inhibition of FabI. In in vivo studies, following intraperitoneal dosing at 50 mg/kg, 9 was found to be effective in a S. aureus groin abscess infection model in rats, providing an approximately 2.5 log reduction in bacterial counts relative to untreated controls. Conclusion We have described the identification of the aminopyridine derivative 9 as a novel small-molecule inhibitor of bacterial enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI). Compound 9 is a low micromolar inhibitor of FabI from S. aureus and H. influenzae, has good narrow-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activity, and is effective in vivo in a S. aureus infection model in rats. Mode of action and cytotoxicity studies confirm that the antibacterial activity of 9 is due to inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis through inhibition of FabI. Furthermore, the compound is a selective inhibitor of bacterial FAS, showing no detectable inhibition of the human FAS system. These results demonstrate that FabI is a valid antibacterial target and that small-molecule FabI inhibitors have the potential to be systemically active agents for the treatment of bacterial infections. Further studies in this area are ongoing in our laboratories, and results will be reported in due course. Experimental Section

Crystals of the E. coli FabI/NAD+ inhibitor complexes were obtained using the same methods and conditions as those reported earlier.31 Diffraction data to 2.4 Å resolution were collected at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The structures were solved with the difference Fourier methods using the E. coli FabI/NAD+ triclosan structure31 as the starting model. The 5 cocrystal structure was refined with the program XPLOR,39 while the 9 cocrystal structure was refined with the program CNX.40 In both cases, 5% of the data were set aside for Rfree calculations. There is one FabI dimer per crystalline asymmetric unit, with two molecules of inhibitor and two molecules of NAD+ bound. The flipping loop31 is disordered in both the 5 structure (193-205/ 193-202) and the 9 structure (197-202/196-201). The structures have good quality as indicated by various statistical measures as well as good quality electron density maps (see Supporting Information). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Databank for 5 (PDB accession code 1LX6) and 9 (PDB accession code 1LXC). Enzyme Inhibition Assays. Assays were carried out in half-area 96-well microtiter plates. Compounds were evaluated in 150 µL (FabI) or 100 µL (FabK) assay mixtures containing components specific for each enzyme (see below). Inhibitors were typically varied over the range 0.01-10 µM. The consumption of NAD(P)H was monitored for 20 min at 30 °C by following the change in absorbance at 340 nm. IC50 values were estimated from a fit of the initial velocities to a standard fourparameter model (eq 1), or variations thereof, and were

S. aureus FabI assays contained 100 mM NaADA (ADA ) N-[2-acetamido]-2-iminodiacetic acid), pH 6.5, 4% glycerol, 25 µM crotonoyl-ACP, 50 µM NADPH, and an appropriate dilution of S. aureus FabI (approximately 20 nM). Initial velocities were estimated from the slope of a linear fit of the progress curves. H. influenzae FabI assays contained MDTG buffer (100 mM MES, 51 mM diethanolamine, 51 mM triethanolamine, pH 6.5 [MES ) 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid], 4% glycerol), 25 µM crotonoyl-ACP, 50 µM NADH, and 9 nM H. influenzae FabI. Initial velocities were estimated from an exponential fit of the nonlinear progress curves and are equal to the slope of the tangent at t ) 0 min. E. coli FabI assays contained 100 mM NaADA, pH 6.5 (ADA ) N-[2-acetamido]-2-iminodiacetic acid), 4% glycerol, 0.25 mM crotonoyl-CoA, 50 µM NADH, and approximately 60 nM E. coli FabI. Initial velocities were determined as above for H. influenzae FabI. S. pneumoniae FabK assays contained MDTG buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mM NH4Cl, 25 µM crotonoyl-ACP, 50 µM NADH, and 1.5 nM S. pneumoniae FabK. Initial velocities were determined as above for H. influenzae FabI. Antimicrobial Activity Assay. Whole-cell antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted 1:10 in water to produce a 256 µg/mL stock solution. By use of a 96-well microtiter plate, a Microlab AT Plus 2 (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) serially diluted 50 µL of the stock solution into cationadjusted Mueller Hinton broth (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD). After the compounds were diluted, a 50 µL aliquot of the test isolate (approximately × 106 cfu/mL) was added to each well of the microtiter plate. The final test

Aminopyridine-Based Inhibitors concentrations ranged from 0.06 to 64 µg/mL. Inoculated plates were incubated at 35 °C in ambient air for 18-24 h. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of compound that inhibited visible growth.

(36) The apparent Ki value was calculated from the estimated IC50 value assuming competitive inhibition with the substrate crotonoyl-ACP. However, since detailed mechanistic studies could not be done, because of the low Km of the substrate and limitations in the sensitivity of the assay, the true Ki value could not be determined.
