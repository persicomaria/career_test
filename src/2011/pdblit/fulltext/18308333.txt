Abstract The cDNAs for two b-glucosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.21) isozymes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), designated bglu1 and bglu2 , were cloned and sequenced. The cDNA sequences for bglu1 and bglu2 included open reading frames encoding 504 and 500 amino acid precursor proteins, respectively. Both of these enzymes appeared to enter the secretory pathway, as judged by their N-terminal signal sequences. Southern blots using gene-specific probes indicated that bglu1 and bglu2 were single copy genes. The bglu1 and bglu2 mRNAs were highly expressed in the shoot during germination, with a similar time course. However, differences were seen in expression in mature plants, where bglu1 was highly expressed in flowers, but bglu2 was not. A recombinant thioredoxin fusion protein produced from the bglu1 cDNA in redox-deficient Escherichia coli (BGlu1) hydrolyzed p -nitrophenol b-D-glucoside, b-Dfucoside, and other p -nitrophenol b-D-glycosides, and was strongly inhibited by glucono-1,5-lactone. It also hydrolyzed some natural glucosides, including the rice-derived pyridoxine-5?-O -b-D-glucoside, and hydrolyzed and transglycosylated short b-(1 0/3) and b-(10/4) linked gluco-oligosaccharides. Based on the results, possible functions of BGlu1 include hydrolysis and recycling of oligosaccharides generated from rapid cell wall expansion during seed germination and flower expansion, and release of the coenzyme pyridoxine from its glucose-conjugated storage form. # 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction b-Glucosidases (3.2.1.21) are enzymes that hydrolyze b-glycosidic bonds between the reducing side of glucose and an aryl or alkyl aglycone or oligosaccharide. bGlucosidases are found ubiquitously in eukaryotes, eubacteria and archaea. Generally, these enzymes fall into related families, with glycosyl hydrolase families 1 and 3 being the most prominent [1]. Most well char-

acterized plant b-glucosidases belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 1 [1 /3]. The 3D structure of family 1 enzymes is an (a/b)8 barrel, with the carboxylic acids that serve as the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile located at the carboxyl terminal end of b-strands 4 and 7, respectively [4 /8]. These catalytic amino acids are surrounded by a characteristic consensus of conserved amino acids, which is readily recognized in known, active b-glucosidases. The catalytic acid/base is found in the conserved sequence TFNEP in b-O -glucosidases. The nucleophilic glutamate is always found in the consensus sequence I/ VTENG. In addition to these conserved motifs, certain other amino acids are critical for substrate binding, though some of these are variable reflecting differences

in substrate-specificity [7 /10]. Thus, functional plant bglucosidases are recognized by the conserved sequence motifs that make up their catalytic site, as well as by their overall sequence similarity. Plant b-glucosidases play important roles in defense, phytohormone regulation, oligosaccharide catabolism, lignification, scent production, and various other processes. b-Glucosidases help defend against herbivores and invasive fungi by hydrolyzing relatively inert glycosides to produce toxic compounds, such as HCN, saponins, coumarins, quinones, hydroxamic acid, rotenoids, etc. [11 /15]. Most phytohormones also occur as glucosides [16 /18] and b-glucosidases have been shown in vitro to hydrolyze the glucosides of abcissic acids, auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, thereby activating the hormones [19 /21]. However, b-glucosidases described thus far from barley and rice appear to be involved in recycling of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides produced during germination [22,23]. Some bglucosidases also play important roles in synthesis of natural products which have glucoside precursors, such as terpenoid indole alkaloids [24]. In addition, plants contain many b-glucosides whose functions are still not fully understood, including glucosides of vitamins, naphthoquinone derivatives, and many others [13,25]. One of the earliest studies in rice showed that bglucosidase activity increases during germination [26]. Subsequent studies confirmed this trend and two rice bglucosidases have been purified from germinating rice, one with activity toward gibberellin glucoconjugates [21] and one with greatest activity against b-linked-oligoglucosides [23]. However, the b-glucosidase involved has yet to be identified at the molecular level. Here, we have cloned 2 b-glucosidases from germinating rice, and characterized the expression of these isozymes in germinating and mature rice tissues. bGlucosidase activity was confirmed by recombinant protein expression. The functional rice BGlu1 was characterized for pH and temperature optima, substrate specificity, and inhibition by several inhibitors.

2.2. Preparation of RNA and first strand cDNA Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg 3 to 4-day-old rice seedlings using Trizol Reagent (GIBCO-BRL, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The extracted total RNA (1 / 5 mg) was used as the template to synthesize the firststrand cDNA using 10 pmol Oligo (dT) and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (GIBCO-BRL) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction product mixture was then used directly as template in PCR. 2.3. Cloning of rice b-glucosidase cDNAs The cDNA corresponding to 2 rice b-glucosidase genes were cloned by homology. First, 2 rice EST clones, R2847_6Z (GenBank accession no. AU031958) and R2336 (GenBank accession no. AU184447) were identified by a tBLASTn search [27] of the dbEST database as belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 1, obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) Genome Research Program, Japan, and sequenced by automated DNA sequencing. The sequence of the longest cDNA insert was deposited in GenBank, accession number U28047. A BLASTn search of the U28047 cDNA sequence against the dbEST database identified the EST C29108 as containing the 5? end of the coding sequence (CDS). A 5? sense primer designed from this EST, b-glu217 (GTGCGTGCGTGGCTGCGTGTGCTTG) and the antisense primer RO13pr (CACCAAGCCAAATCTCATCAAC) from the 3?UTR of U28047 were used to amplify the full coding cDNA, after reverse transcription of rice cultivar Orion mRNA, as described above. The amplification was done using 35 cycles of 94 8C, 30 s, 58 8C 30 s and 72 8C 3 min, using Hot Start Taq DNA polymerase (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). A full-length product was obtained, cloned into the Eco R V site of pBlueScript II SK'/ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and thoroughly sequenced. This clone was designated rice bglucosidase 1 (bglu1 ), and its sequence is found in the current GenBank U28047 entry. A second rice b-glucosidase cDNA (bglu2 ) was isolated using the sense primer b-glu156 (GGTTCCCGSCKGGSTTCGTSTTYGG), and the antisense primer b-glu41 (GGCTCATTAAATGTAAACCA), derived from the conserved peptide sequences GFPAGFVFG and WFTFNEP, respectively, to amplify a cDNA fragment of 496 bp from Orion rice by RT-PCR, using conditions similar to those described above. This cDNA product was sequenced and the sequence was used to identify matching ESTs in dbEST with a BLASTn search. A sense primer, b-glu214 (CATCTCTCGCTGGAATGG), designed from the EST clone E60611_11A (GenBank accession no. AU065204) sequence to include the start codon, and

2. Methods

2.1. Plant materials Rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Orion, and cv. Nipponbare) seeds were germinated in the dark for 3 days and in the light from day 4 to 5 at 28 8C under sterile conditions on germinating paper moistened with sterile deionized H2O. The whole seedlings were harvested and kept at (/70 8C until RNA isolation.

an antisense b-glu177 (TGTTTATTCCTCCACTCAAGGATC), derived from the 496 bp fragment's sequence, were used to amplify the 5? end region of approximately 400 bp. A sense primer, b-glu176 (sense version of b-glu177), was used in 3?-RACE [28], and the approximately 1450 bp product was sequenced completely. Finally, the b-glu214 sense primer and RO23pr primer (AACACTGCTCGACAGGGAGC), derived from the 3?UTR of the cDNA, were used to amplify the full-length cDNA. The PCR amplification was done as above with 54 8C annealing and 3 min extension, using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The full-length product was cloned into the Sma I site of pBluScript II SK'/ (Stratagene) and sequenced. Similarity of the deduced amino acid sequences of both genes to other b-glucosidases was confirmed by BLAST searches of the GenBank database. The cDNA sequences of bglu1 and bglu2 were searched against the dbEST database to identify matching ESTs in rice and these ESTs were used to search the Rice Genome Research Program (http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp) mapped EST markers to identified the chromosomal locations of bglu1 and bglu2 . Protein sequence alignments were done with the ClustalX implementation of ClustalW [29,30]. Protein analyses were done at the Expasy proteomics server (http://www.expasy.org/), signal sequences were done by SignalP [31], and predictions of cellular location by PSORT [32].

2.5. Northern blot analysis Total RNA was isolated from different parts of rice seedlings at various days of germination by the method of Bachem et al. [35]. Twenty micrograms of total RNA was denatured, electrophoresed on 1.5% formaldehyde/ agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond N'/) by standard procedures [36]. RNA blots were then prehybridized and hybridized separately with the a32P-labeled specific 3?UTR PCR products for bglu1 (284 bp), bglu2 (267 bp), and 18S rRNA (342 bp) as described above for Southern blot analysis. The rice 18S rRNA probe (342 bp) was PCR amplified with the 18Sricef (AAGTTTGAGGCAATAACAG) and 18Sricer (CCTCTAAATGATAAGGTTC) primers, derived from the 3? end of the GenBank AC number AF069218 sequence. 2.6. Protein expression in Escherichia coli The cDNA encoding the mature proteins of bglu1 and bglu2 were cloned into pET32a('/) and expressed in E. coli , but only bglu1 produced significant quantities of active protein. The bglu1 cDNA was PCR amplified using Orion rice cDNA as the template with the ROex8f (TGCCTACGTAGTGCCCAAGCCCAACTGGCTG) and b-glu135 (AGTCTGCGTGTCTTGAATTCTCAGTGC) primers and Pfu DNA polymerase to introduce Sna B I and Eco R I sites at the 5? and 3? ends, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the Eco R V site of pBluScript II SK('/), and the resultant recombinant plasmids were purified and digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The gelpurified inserts were cloned between the Eco R V and Eco R I site of pET32a('/). The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Origami(DE3) E. coli . For expression, the selected clones were grown in LB broth containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin, 12.5 mg/ml tetracyclin and 15 mg/ml kanamycin at 37 8C to an OD of 0.5 /0.6. Then, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mM, and the cultures were incubated at 20 8C for 8 h. Induced cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 )/g at 4 8C for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml per gram freshly prepared extraction buffer (20 mM Tris /HCl pH 8.0, 200 mg/ml lysozyme, 1% Triton-X 100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), 40 mg/ml Dnase I), incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and disrupted by sonication. A total protein sample was collected from the cell suspension after sonication, and a soluble protein sample was collected from the supernatant, after centrifugation at 12 000 )/g at 4 8C for 10 min. Purification of soluble protein BGlu1 was done with Ni-NTA superflow resin (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fractions with BGlu1, as judged

2.4. Southern blot analysis Genomic DNA was isolated from 4-d-old seedlings as described by Doyle and Doyle [33]. Ten micrograms of DNA was digested with 20 U of Bam H I, Bgl II, Eco R I, Hind III, Xho I or Xba I for 24 h, and Southern blots were done by standard methods [34] on Hybond N'/ nylon membranes (Amersham-Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Blots were hybridized at 50 8C for 16 h with the a32P-labeled specific bglu1 and bglu2 3?UTR PCR product probes. The bglu1 (284 bp) DNA probe was amplified with the RO13pf (TGAGAATGAAAGACACGCAGAC) and RO13pr (CACCAAGCCAAATCTCATCAAC) primers, while the bglu2 (267 bp) probe was amplified with the RO23pf (TCAAGAGGCACTGATCCAGC) and RO23pr (AACACTGCTCGACAGGGAGC) primers. The bglu1 and bglu2 hybridized blots were then washed twice in 2X SSC/0.05% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, and once in 1X SSC/0.05% SDS at 55 8C for 10 min, then exposed to X-ray film.

by p -nitrophenyl b-D-glucoside (p NPG) hydrolysis, were pooled and the buffer exchanged with 20 mM Tris /HCl pH 8.0 with 30 kDa-cutoff ultrafiltration membranes (YM-30, Amicon). All of the protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. 2.7. b-Glucosidase assays b-Glucosidase activity for various substrates was assayed by determining either (1) p -nitrophenol (p NP) liberated from the p NP derivatives of monosaccharides or disaccharides, or (2) glucose released from natural or artificial glucoside substrates by PGO assay as previously described [14]. One unit of b-glucosidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 mmol of product per min. Protein assays were performed by protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The products of BGlu1 hydrolysis of laminari- and cello-oligosaccharides, and rice pyridoxine-5?-O -b-Dglucoside were detected by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The assay mixtures containing 5 mM substrate, 50 mM NaOAc pH 5.0, and purified BGlu1 (0.001 U) were incubated for 1 h at 30 8C. Five microliters of the reaction mixture was spotted on a 0.25 mm silica-coated aluminium plate, F254 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and chromatographed vertically with solvents of EtOAc/HOAc /H2O (2:1:1) for the oligosaccharides and chloroform /methanol /NH4OH (7:3:2) for pyridoxine glucoside. The products were detected under 365 nm UV light, or sprayed with developer solution (2% anisaldehyde, 2% H2SO4, 3% water in ethyl alcohol) and baked at 100 8C for 5 min to visualize the glucose. The pH optimum for BGlu1 activity was determined by measuring release of pNP from p NPG in different 50 mM buffers ranging in pH from 3 to 11 in 0.5 pH unit increments (formate pH 3 /4; NaOAc pH 4.5 /5.5; sodium phosphate pH 6 /7.5; Tris pH 8/9.5; CAPS pH 10 /11). The temperature optimum was determined by the standard p NPG hydrolysis assay in 50 mM NaOAc pH 5.0 over a temperature range of 5/70 8C at 58 increments. 2.8. Effects of inhibitors on enzyme activity For inhibition studies, 1 mM pNPG was used as the substrate. In most cases, the substrate and inhibitor were mixed in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, followed by adding BGlu1, and incubated for 10 min at 30 8C. The reaction was stopped by adding one half volume 0.4 M Na2CO3, and the absorbance was read at 410 nm. IAA and GA3 were dissolved in 50% ethanol (12.5% in the final assay), and an ethanol control was used to correct for inhibition by ethanol alone.

3. Results 3.1. b-Glucosidase cDNAs cloning and sequence analysis Primary structure determination of the first rice bglucosidase isozyme (bglu1 ) was begun by identifying 2 rice EST sequences homologous to plant b-glucosidases and sequencing the corresponding clones. This sequence was combined with that of a 5? matching EST (dbEST accession no. C29108) to give a full CDS, the cDNA for which was RT-PCR amplified from rice cultivar Orion RNA. The full cDNA sequence, GenBank accession no. U28047, contained 1909 nucleotides, with a 1512 nucleotide open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 504 amino acid precursor protein, predicted by the SignalP program to contain a 28 amino acid presequence and a 476 amino acid mature protein. The second rice b-glucosidase isozyme (bglu2 ) cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR cloning from Orion rice seedling RNA, using degenerate primers based on conserved peptide sequences (GFPAGFVFG and WFTFNEP). A 496 nucleotide cDNA fragment product was obtained, and the sequence overlapped that of the AU065204 EST, covering the 5? end of the CDS. Using this EST sequence to amplify the 5? end and 3?-RACE to generate the 3? end, a 1797 bp long cDNA was obtained (GenBank accession no. AY056828). The sequence contained a 1500 nucleotide ORF encoding a 500 amino acid protein precursor, predicted to consist of a 25 amino acid prepeptide and a 475 amino acid mature protein. A BLAST search of the dbEST EST database showed that bglu1 gene was most highly represented glycosyl hydrolase family 1 gene transcript in rice, with 57 matching ESTs. The source libraries for the bglu1 ESTs seedling shoot (19), seedling root (11), callus (11), panicle (11), leaf (3), immature root (1) and stem (1), reflecting its expression in many tissues. Bglu2 matched 8 rice ESTs, all of which came from young growing plant parts: shoot (3); stem (1) and young leaf (4). As ESTs for both bglu1 and bglu2 genes had been mapped to chromosome location by the Rice Genome Research Program, their map location could be identified. The ESTs R2847, D24959 and AU031958, matching bglu1 , have been mapped to rice chromosome 3 at position 122.8 cM (distance to the locus from the short arm end). Similarly, the ESTs AU033015 and D39581, matching bglu2 , have been mapped to chromosome 9 at position 72.1 cM. The BGlu1 protein sequence had the highest sequence identity (66%) with barley b-glucosidase BGQ60 (GenBank accession AAA87339), while BGlu2 protein had highest sequence identity (54%) with the cyanogenic bglucosidases, amygdalin hydrolase isoform AH I of Prunus serotina (GenBank accession AAA93234) in

BGQ60. The BGlu1 and BGlu2 protein sequences contained 3 and 6 possible N-linked glycosylation sites, respectively. 3.2. Nucleic acid-blot analysis Specific probes were generated by amplification of portions from the 3?UTR of bglu1 and bglu2 cDNA (284 and 267 bp, respectively). To confirm hybridization to a single gene of each of these isozyme probes, Southern blots of rice genomic DNA were probed with each probe. As seen in Fig. 2, the results were consistent with a single gene copy corresponding to each cDNA, as specific hybridization with a single intense band is seen in most lanes. The patterns of hybridization were different, indicating that bglu1 and bglu2 probes do not hybridize to the same genes. 3.3. Spatial expression pattern in seedling and flowering stage RNA gel-blot analysis was also used to determine transcript levels in tissues of 7-d-old seedlings and 6week-old mature plants, relative to an18S rRNA control (Fig. 3A). In seedlings, both bglu1 and bglu2 transcripts were detected in high abundance in the shoot, and at low levels in the root and endosperm. In 6-week-old mature plant, the bglu1 transcript was detected at highest levels in flower, with moderate levels in node, low levels in leaf sheath and inter node, and very low levels in root. In contrast to bglu1 , bglu2 was only detected at significant

levels in node, while no or low signal was seen in other mature plant parts. 3.4. Temporal expression in seedlings during germination stage The temporal expression pattern of bglu1 and bglu2 in seedling tissues during germination was examined using total RNA extracted from whole seedlings. As shown in Fig. 3B, the transcripts of bglu1 and bglu2 were not detectable in seeds before germination (germination at day 0). Both transcripts were detected on day 2 with a moderate signal for bglu1 and a low signal for bglu2 . Both signals increased on day 4 and bglu1 maintained a similar high level of expression from day 4 to day 10, with decreasing signal at 12 and 14 days. The bglu2 expression pattern was similar with the highest levels seen on day 8, then levels decreased on days 12 and 14. 3.5. Recombinant protein expression The bglu1 cDNA was expressed in redox-deficient E. coli as N-terminal thioredoxin fusion proteins, BGlu1. The protein CDS without its predicted signal peptide was cloned into pET32a('/), which also contains a Histag sequence in the N-terminal tag. BGlu1 protein was produced in active form in Origami (DE3) E. coli and hydrolyzed p NPG at high levels compared to control culture extracts (Table 1). The Bglu1 activity was optimal at pH 5.0 and 15/35 8C. Comparisons of protein profiles by SDS-PAGE showed that induced cultures of BGlu1 had intense bands at 66 kDa in total cell lysates and soluble fractions, when compared to negative control with nonrecombinant plasmid (Fig. 4). Similar attempts to express protein from bglu2 resulted in mainly insoluble and inactive protein (data not shown). 3.6. BGlu1 substrate specificity The activity of the purified rice BGlu1 b-glucosidase towards artificial and natural glycosides is summarized in Table 2. BGlu1 hydrolyzed the disaccharides, laminaribiose (b-1,3), cellobiose (b-1,4), and gentiobiose (b1,6). It also hydrolyzed laminaritriose and cello-oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 3/4 at a relatively high rate. Laminaribiose and cellotetraose were the natural substrates with the highest rates of hydrolysis (95 and 58% of p NPG hydrolysis). This accounts for hydrolysis of laminaribiose producing 2 glucose molecules by dividing the amount of glucose measured by two, but not for sequential hydrolysis of cellotetraose, which could also give more than one glucose. In addition to hydrolysis activity, BGlu1 showed transglycosylation activity towards laminari-

oligosaccharides with DP of 2 and 3, and cellooligosaccharides with a DP of 3 and 4 at the relatively low substrate concentration of 5 mM, as detected by TLC (Fig. 5). On the TLC, laminaribiose and cellotriose appeared to be hydrolysed more rapidly than other oligosaccharides.

BGlu1 also hydrolyzed several natural-glucosides, but with lower activity relative to pNPG. It hydrolyzed cyanogenic glucosides such as prunasin from Prunus serotina ; amygdalin from almond, and dhurrin from sorghum, but it did not hydrolyze linamarin, from cassava. Pyridoxine-5?-O -b-D-glucoside was cleaved rapidly by BGlu1, but could not be quantified accurately by spectrophotometric measurement, because it or its breakdown products interfered with the glucose oxidase assay, yielding reddish color, rather than green with ABTS. BGlu1 hydrolyzed this substrate completely to give glucose and pyridoxine, as detected by TLC (Fig. 6). The purified BGlu1 hydrolyzed the pNP-b-glycosides of the monosaccharides, D-glucose, D-fucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, and the disaccharide D-cellobiose, but

The products of the hydrolysis of p NP-b-Dcellobioside by BGlu1 identified by TLC included p NPG, pNP and glucose, but no D-cellobiose was seen, indicating the initial cleavage is between the two glucose residues (data not shown). 3.7. Inhibition studies The inhibitory effects of some organic compounds toward BGlu1 are shown in Table 3.

4. Discussion In this study, 2 cDNAs for rice b-glucosidases, bglu1 and bglu2 , were isolated and characterized. Gene locations for these two enzymes were identified from the Rice Genome Research Program map, and their representation in the dbEST database was confirmed. It was shown that both bglu1 and bglu2 are highly expressed in shoots (young leaves and stems) during germination, but expressed only at lower levels in other germinating seed parts. In adult plants, bglu1 expression is high in flower, while the expression of both isozymes is lower in other plant parts, such as node and internode. The overall pattern of expression of the genes was similar to their representation in the EST database, though high expression of bglu1 in flower was not obvious in the dbEST, likely due to poor representation of this tissue in the database. The b-glucosidase function of the protein product of bglu1 was confirmed by recombinant protein production in E. coli . The active rice BGlu1 was characterized for substrate specificity and biochemical properties. Whatever the roles of rice bglu1 and bglu2 are, they are likely to be somewhat different, since their sequence differences, especially around the active site, are likely to be reflected in substrate specificity differences and they have overlapping expression patterns during germina-

tion stage in the same tissues. The high expression of the rice bglu1 and bglu2 in rapidly growing shoots, suggests a role in growth, possibly in recycling of oligosaccharides generated during rapid cell wall expansion and cell division, in activation of phytohormone, or in defense of young tissues. Cell wall recycling is likely to be necessary for cell wall expansion and cell division during germination and flower expansion. Rice BGlu1 hydrolyzed b-linked disaccharides and small oligosaccharide at relatively high rates. This indicated that a possible role of the enzyme might be further hydrolysis of oligosaccharides released from cell wall b-glucans during germination or flower expansion. BGlu1 also had high transglucosylation activity towards short chain laminari- and cellooligosaccharides, with relatively high catalytic efficiency at low concentrations of substrates. This suggests that BGlu1 function may involve generating new oligosaccharides by recycling the sugar residues released from the cell wall. This is similar to barley BGQ60 [22] and rice cell-wall associated b-glucosidase [23], which appear to be involved in recycling of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides produced during germination. However, the sequence does not match the N-terminal protein sequence of the cell-wall-associated rice b-glucosidase [23]. In addition, bglu1 sequence had the highest sequence identity (66%) with barley b-glucosidase BGQ60. However, expression of the barley b-glucosidase is limited to maturing grains and no new synthesis was seen in germinating tissues [22,37], unlike bglu1 and bglu2 . This may reflect a difference in rice and barley, since b-glucosidase activity in barley has been shown to decrease during germination, while rice has been seen to increase [26,37]. The high expression of bglu1 in flowers and presence of gibberellin glucosides in these tissues [16] is consistent with a role in phytohormone activation. Interestingly, BGlu1 was also inhibited by IAA and GA3, which might indicate these compounds bind to the active site, perhaps at the aglycone binding site. However, the glucosides of these and similar phytohormones were not available to test whether they are actually substrates for BGlu1. Some role in defense for rice bglu1 and bglu2 also cannot be ruled out, and the enzymes may play more than one role. For instance, maize Bglu1 has been identified by different labs as hydrolyzing DIMBOAglucoside, a defense-related compound [14], and phytohormone glucosides [19]. Rice BGlu1 also hydrolyzed many kinds of aglycones conjugated with glucose, though rather poorly compared with p NPG. BGlu1 can hydrolyze the cyanogenic glycosides prunasin, dhurrin, and amygdalin, but not linamarin, suggesting a requirement for an aromatic or other ring structure in the aglycone moiety for hydrolysis. The enzyme also hydrolyzed rice pyridoxine-5?-O b-glucoside, a major metabolite in rice bran [38]. This

636

substrate might implicate BGlu1 in the metabolism of the coenzyme pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Vitamin B6 glucoside conjugate is found only in plants [39]. Though the current understanding of the functions of vitamin glycosides is incomplete, the one identified function of pyridoxine glucoside in plants is to serve as a metabolically inactive storage form [25]. The sugar moiety seemed to have less influence on binding to the rice BGlu1 enzyme than the aglycone moiety, like maize b-glucosidase [14], but unlike the rice cell-wall bound b-glucosidase [23] and barley BGQ60 [22]. BGlu1 hydrolyzed various p NP-derivatives of monosaccharides, but with specificity for the D-form of sugar residues and the b-O -glycosidic linkage, as it did not hydrolyze the a-O -glycosidic bond, b-S-glycosidic linkage (pNP-b-D-thioglucoside), nor the L-glycosides. The relative activity values varied 30-fold from p NP-b-D-mannose to p NP-b-D-fucose, which suggests that the sugar moiety has a relatively weak effect on the rate of hydrolysis. The fact that pNP-b-D-cellobioside was a substrate with relatively high activity, suggested the enzyme might also cleave off disaccharides. However, the TLC analysis clearly showed that the first cleavage is of the bglucosidic bond between the two glucose residues, releasing pNPG and glucose. The pNPG is then rapidly hydrolyzed. This sequential pathway is similar to an exoglucanase or exocellulase [40]. The rapid hydrolysis of cellotriose to cellobiose and glucose may reflect binding to the active site in a manner similar to p NPcellobiose. However, the cellobiose produced is not a good substrate. The analysis of oligosaccharide cleavage was complicated by transglucosylation and sequential hydrolysis of the products. Though cellotriose was a better substrate by TLC, cellotetraose seemed to be better in the glucose oxidase assay of released glucose. This likely reflects rapid hydrolysis of the cellotriose produced from cellotetraose. Interestingly, hydrolysis of b-1,3-linked oligosaccharides decreased above a DP of two. Laminaribiose was the best substrate, but laminaritriose gave lower activity than laminaribiose and longer polymers were not hydrolyzed. On the other hand, cellobiose was the poorest substrate, but longer polymers (DP 3 and 4) had much higher activity than cellobiose. So, the enzyme seems to have an extensive binding site (at least three glucose residues binding in the case of cellotriose) which is dependent on substrate geometry, as has been described for barley [40 /42]. Hrmova et al. [40,41] have done extensive studies of the substrate binding and hydrolysis of the closely related barley b-glucosidase. They found similar preferences for short b-1,3-linked glucooligosaccharides and longer b-1,4-linked oligosaccharides. However, while the barley b-glucosidase was a good cellobiosidase and seemed to bind poorly at the third position, BGlu1 is

a poor cellobiosidase and is better at hydrolyzing cellotriose. As was noted for barley b-glucosidase [40], Bglu1's specificity for cello-oligosaccharides would allow it to be characterized as a 1,4-b-glucan exohydrolase (3.2.1.74). However, as it hydrolyses other oligosaccharides, and aryl- and alkyl-glucosides, classifying BGlu1 as a b-glucosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.21) seems more appropriate. Glucono-1,5-lactone, an analogue of the oxocarbanium ion-like transition state, strongly inhibited rice BGlu1, while galactono-1,4-lactone was a weak inhibitor, as were some potential substrate aglycones. On the other hand, glucose and other monosaccharides had no effect on enzyme activity at 10 mM, suggesting that sugars do not bind tightly to the active site. In summary, rice bglu1 and bglu2 were cloned by homology to known b-glucosidases and found to have the conserved catalytic amino acids necessary for this activity. Their sequence differences are likely to be reflected in substrate specificity differences, and they have overlapping expression patterns. Preliminary analysis of the Syngenta japonica [43] and Beijing indica [44] rice genomes, indicates the presence of approximately 50 glycosyl hydrolase family 1 genes in rice (Opassiri, unpublished). Of these genes, approximately 25 are represented by ESTs in the dbEST database, indicating they are expressed. While bglu1 and bglu2 are represented by 57 and 8 ESTs, respectively, the other genes are generally represented by fewer than 8 ESTs. Thus, the description of these two relatively highly expressed genes in the present work is a significant initial step toward characterizing this family in rice.
