Hedgehog (Hh) signaling molecules mediate key tissue-patterning events during animal development, and inappropriate activation of Hh signaling in adults has been associated with human cancers. Recently, a conserved family of type I integral membrane proteins required for normal response to the Hh signal was discovered. One member of this family, Ihog (interference hedgehog), functions upstream or at the level of Patched (Ptc), but how Ihog participates in Hh signaling remains unclear. Here, we show that heparin binding induces Ihog dimerization and is required to mediate high-affinity interactions between Ihog and Hh. We also present crystal structures of a Hh-binding fragment of Ihog, both alone and complexed with Hh. Heparin is not well ordered in these structures, but a basic cleft in the first FNIII domain of Ihog (IhogFn1) is shown by mutagenesis to mediate heparin binding. These results establish that Hh directly binds Ihog and provide the first demonstration of a specific role for heparin in Hh responsiveness.

diminished Hh binding and responsiveness, (ii) epistasis experiments place Ihog function upstream or at the level of Ptc, (iii) the Ihog extracellular region is able to pull down HhN from conditioned medium, and (iv) coexpression of Ptc and Ihog results in a synergistic increase in Hh binding to the cell surface (11). The first FNIII domain of Ihog (IhogFn1) is necessary and sufficient to pull down HhN, but both FNIII domains are needed to synergize with Ptc and reconstitute Ihog function in cell-based signaling assays (11). Complicating interpretation of Ihog function is the observation that purified HhN and Ihog extracellular regions do not appreciably interact (see Fig. 2 A), indicating that a binary interaction between Ihog and Hh cannot explain Ihog function. To investigate the role of Ihog in Hh signaling, we initiated structural and biophysical studies of functional fragments of Drosophila melanogaster Ihog and Hh. Results and Discussion

H

edgehog (Hh) is a secreted signaling molecule that mediates key tissue-patterning events during both vertebrate and invertebrate development (1­3). Hh also plays an important role in the maintenance and regulation of stem cells in adult organisms (4, 5). Abnormal activation of the Hh signaling pathway has been implicated in the initiation and growth of many human tumors (6), and drugs targeting the Hh pathway are under development (7). Hh is secreted but undergoes two lipid modifications that restrict its free diffusion and facilitate transport to appropriate target sites (8, 9). Hh binding to Ptc, a 12-pass integral membrane protein with homology to bacterial resistance­nodulation­ division (RND) transporters (10) is a central event in Hh signaling and blocks the ability of Ptc to inhibit the seven-pass integral membrane protein Smoothened (Smo), a positive regulator of Hh responses (10). Recent genetic and RNAi experiments implicate the membrane-associated proteins Ihog and dally-like protein (Dlp) in Hh responsiveness (11­14). Dlp, a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (15), has dual roles in mediating Hh responsiveness and in transport of the Hh signal to distant cells (12­14). Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, in particular, have also been implicated in Hh movement by the observation that tout velu, which encodes a heparan sulfate copolymerase (16, 17) that acts on Dlp (12), is required for normal Hh transport. Ihog, a Drosophila protein previously known as CG9211, is a type I transmembrane protein with four Ig domains followed by two FNIII domains, a membrane-spanning region, and a cytoplasmic region of no known function (11). Ihog is homologous to another Drosophila protein, CG32796 or brother of Ihog (BOI), and two mammalian proteins, CDO and BOC (18, 19), that are also components of the Hh signaling pathway (11, 20, 21). Several observations indicate that Ihog may function as a coreceptor for Hh: (i) reduction of Ihog expression results in

was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction and refined to 1.35-Å resolution (Table 2, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The crystal structure of a tandem repeat of both Ihog FNIII domains (IhogFn1­2) was then determined by molecular replacement and refined to 2.4-Å resolution (Table 1; and see Table 3, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Because the IhogFn1 structure is essentially identical in both crystals (rmsd of 0.63 Å for 108 shared C s), subsequent discussion will focus on the IhogFn1­2 structure. Both FNIII repeats in IhogFn1­2 adopt the canonical -sandwich topology of FNIII domains (22) but fold back on one another in an unusual ``horseshoe-like'' arrangement (Fig. 1A). This domain arrangement has not been observed in previous multiFNIII repeat structures (23, 24), but a similar arrangement has been observed for repeated Ig-like -sandwich domains in axonin-1 (25) and hemolin (26).

The interdomain interaction at the core of the IhogFn1­2 structure buries 1,110 Å2 of surface area and exhibits a high degree of shape complementarity (0.74), values consistent with a stable interface (27, 28). Additionally, when two threonines, T534 and T630, with side chains that form a hydrogen bond across the interdomain interface, are substituted with cysteine, a disulfide bond is formed, as judged by altered mobility of the variant protein in SDS PAGE experiments (data not shown). Introduction of this disulfide bond, which fixes the protein in the horseshoe conformation, has no effect on Ihog function in cell-based signaling assays, indicating that this conformation represents a biologically active form of the protein (Fig. 4A).
IhogFn1 and IhogFn1­2 Bind Heparin. A second striking feature of the IhogFn1­2 structure is a localized region of positive charge that encompasses seven basic residues on IhogFn1 (R503, K507, R508, K509, R547, R549, and K567). This region is conserved in

invertebrate and vertebrate Ihog homologs (Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), and multiple sulfate ions are bound to this site in both the IhogFn1 and IhogFn1­2 crystals (Fig. 1B). The conservation of this basic region and the presence of bound sulfate ions led us to test whether IhogFn1­2 binds heparin, a highly sulfated polysaccharide similar to the heparan chains of HSPGs, which are known to play a role in Hh signaling (17). Pull-down experiments and heparin-column chromatography show that both IhogFn1 and IhogFn1­2 bind heparin-agarose and elute at 800 mM NaCl (Fig. 7, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site, and data not shown).
Heparin Promotes Interactions Between IhogFn1­2 and HhN. The

observation that IhogFn1­2, like HhN, binds heparin suggested that a requirement for heparin might explain the failure of purified HhN and IhogFn1­2 to interact, as judged by sizeexclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A). Pull-down experiments, which previously detected an interaction between HhN and IhogFn1, were carried out in heparin-containing medium (11). When size-exclusion chromatography experiments with HhN alone, IhogFn1­2 alone, and a mixture of HhN and IhogFn1­2 were repeated in the presence of a molar excess of heparin decasaccharide, two new interactions were observed. Heparin decasaccharide produced a shift in the elution time of IhogFn1­2 alone that is indicative of dimer formation (Fig. 2B), and mixtures of HhN and IhogFn1­2 shifted to faster eluting fractions, consistent with formation of complexes having HhN IhogFn1­2 stoichiometries of up to 2:2 (Fig. 2B). Heparin is thus not only essential for high-affinity interactions between purified HhN and IhogFn1­2 but also promotes IhogFn1­2 dimerization. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments with HhN, IhogFn1­2, and heparin were carried out to investigate the strength, stoichiometr y, and potential cooperativity of IhogFn1­2 and HhN complexes. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments show that IhogFn1­2 alone is monomeric in solution but exists in a monomer­dimer equilibrium, with dimerization constants of 60 5 M and 430 10 M in the presence of heparin decasaccharide and hexasaccharide, respectively (Fig. 2C; and see Fig. 8, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Similar experiments with HhN in the presence of heparin oligosaccharides show no evidence for HhN oligomerization (Fig. 2D). The ubiquitous presence of heparan sulfate and high effective concentrations of membrane proteins at the cell surface suggest that Ihog and its homologs are likely to be constitutively dimerized on the cell surface, consistent with an earlier observation that vertebrate Ihog homologs coimmunoprecipitate from cell lysates (18). AUC experiments with mixtures of HhN and IhogFn1­2 at 20 M total protein and in the presence of excess heparin decasaccharide also demonstrate the formation of HhN IhogFn1­2 complexes with a maximal 2:2 stoichiometry (Fig. 2D; and see Fig. 9 and Table 4, which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). By modeling the expected AUC results for given distributions of HhN IhogFn1­2 complexes, equilibrium constants that best fit the data were obtained. Slight cooperativity between various subcomplexes is required to achieve good fits to the experimental data, but all well fit models yield values of dissociation constants for HhN IhogFn1­2 interactions in the 0.4­8.0 M range (see Materials and Methods).

3). Two essentially identical 2:2 complexes of HhN IhogFn1­2 are present in the asymmetric unit. The structures of IhogFn1­2 and HhN within this complex are fundamentally unchanged relative to their unbound conformations; superposition of complexed and uncomplexed forms of IhogFn1­2 results in an rmsd of 1.24 Å for 208 shared C s, and superposition of the complexed form of HhN with an uncomplexed form of murine Sonic HhN (66% amino acid sequence identity) (29) results in an rmsd of 0.68 Å for 142 shared C s. HhN domains are homologous to prokaryotic zinc hydrolases (29), but, unlike Sonic HhN, no evidence for a bound metal ion is found in the HhN electron density. This result is not unexpected, because two key metal17210 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0606738103

coordinating residues are not conserved in HhN, and the signaling ability of HhN does not appear to rely on an intrinsic catalytic activity (30). Two different contacts between HhN and IhogFn1­2 are observed in the crystal lattice, one mediated by IhogFn1, and another mediated primarily by IhogFn2, but mutagenesis experiments clearly identify the interface restricted to IhogFn1 as physiologically relevant (Fig. 3 A and D). Restriction of the Ihog Hh interface to IhogFn1 accounts for experiments showing that IhogFn1 alone is sufficient both to pull down HhN from conditioned media (11) and to bind HhN in the presence of heparin, as judged by gel filtration (data not shown). The IhogFn1 and HhN interface buries 1,180 Å2 and has a shape complementarity parameter of 0.70, values comparable to those of known biological interfaces, and consists of a core of three hydrophobic residues surrounded by predominantly polar interactions (Fig. 3C). The central residue of the hydrophobic contact is V103 of HhN, which nestles between L551 and V553 of Ihog. Another key residue is R238 of HhN, which makes four hydrogen bond or salt-bridge contacts to three Ihog residues, one through a water molecule. A majority of the Ihog residues at the HhN IhogFn1­2 interface, including R238 and V103 of HhN and V553 of Ihog, are conserved among invertebrate homologs

but not among vertebrate homologs (Fig. 10, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). This conservation pattern is consistent with pull-down assays, which indicate that the FNIII domain primarily responsible for mediating interactions with Hh has shifted from IhogFn1 in Drosophila (invertebrate) to the domain homologous to IhogFn2 in CDO and BOC (vertebrate) (11, 20).
Heparin Is Required for Ihog Function and Hh Responsiveness. Although present in the crystallization buffer, no evidence for well ordered heparin is apparent at or near the HhN IhogFn1­2 interface. This absence may stem from the presence of 2.0 M phosphate and 0.2 M sulfate ions in the crystallization buffer, which are likely to compete for heparin binding. An electrostatic potential map of the complex does, however, reveal that the conserved region of positive charge on IhogFn1 noted earlier is adjacent to the HhN IhogFn1­2 interface and is contiguous with a strip of positive charge on HhN (Fig. 3B). This observation, coupled with the absence of conformational changes in HhN or IhogFn1­2 that could arise from allosteric effects, suggests that heparin promotes HhN IhogFn1­2 interactions by binding both proteins and bridging this interface. To verify that this positively charged strip is responsible for mediating heparin binding and to assess the role of heparin binding in Ihog function, basic amino acids in this strip in both Ihog (R503, K507, K509, and R547) and Hh (K105, R147, R213, and R239) were mutated to glutamate. The IhogFn1­2 variant (IhogFn1­2Hep) failed to bind heparin Sepharose (data not shown), and full-length Ihog with the four IhogFn1­2Hep substitutions failed to support normal Hh binding in cell-based assays (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the Hh variant (HhN-Ren Basic Strip) showed a dramatic reduction in its ability to bind to cells overexpressing Ihog (Fig. 4B). These data demonstrate that the positively charged region of IhogFn1 is important for both heparin and HhN binding. Although the IhogFn1­2Hep substitutions are adjacent to the HhN IhogFn1­2 interface, they do not form any part of the contact surface, and their influence on HhN binding is almost certainly indirect through interference with heparin binding. The fact that mutating basic residues on HhN that are adjacent to but not within the HhN IhogFn1­2 interface also greatly decreases HhN binding to the cell surface supports the likelihood that heparin promotes HhN Ihog interactions by directly binding and spanning the HhN Ihog complex. The importance of heparin for mediating interactions between HhN and cell-surface components was further verified by performing cell-binding experiments after heparinase treatment (Fig. 4C). Incubation of HhN-conditioned medium with hepaMcLellan et al.

rinase reduced HhN binding to Ihog- and or Ptc-overexpressing cells by 3-fold, indicating that heparin contributes significantly to high-affinity interactions between Hh and its receptor complex in this assay. To investigate whether the heparindependence of HhN binding to cells translates into a loss of Hh responsiveness, cells transfected with HA-tagged Smo were incubated with HhN-conditioned medium that was pretreated with heparinase (Fig. 4D). HhN-dependent Smo phosphorylation is largely absent after heparinase treatment, indicating that heparin is required for normal pathway activation. A role for heparin in vertebrate Hh responsiveness appears to be conserved, with HSPGs having been shown to exert both positive and negative effects on Shh activity (31).
IhogFn1­2 Forms a Symmetric Dimer. Because both gel-filtration

and AUC experiments indicated the formation of IhogFn1­2 dimers, the HhN IhogFn1­2 crystal lattice was inspected for IhogFn1­2 contacts. Two possible Ihog Ihog dimers were observed. One dimer is mediated primarily by regions on IhogFn1 (Fig. 5) and another primarily by IhogFn2. An IhogFn1­2 variant bearing amino acid substitutions designed to distinguish between these potential dimer interfaces proved insoluble and unsuitable for further studies, but two observations suggest that the interface mediated primarily by IhogFn1 is responsible for the Ihog dimerization observed in the presence of heparin: (i) IhogFn1 alone dimerizes in the presence of heparin (Fig. 11, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), and (ii) the IhogFn1-mediated interface results in a self-limited dimer in contrast to the predominantly IhogFn2-mediated interface, which would allow extended filaments. No evidence for IhogFn1­2 complexes larger than dimers is observed in either AUC or size-exclusion chromatography experiments (Fig. 2). Electron density for a sulfated monosaccharide is present in a crevice formed between subunits in the IhogFn1-mediated dimer (Fig. 12, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), but the precise nature of this monosaccharide and whether it is part of a larger disordered polysaccharide are unclear. No atomic model has thus been fit to this density, but its position between IhogFn1­2 subunits may explain the formation of IhogFn1­2 dimers in the presence of heparin. This site is distinct from the heparin-binding site identified by charge and mutagenesis, and modeling suggests that it is unlikely that a single heparin decasaccharide could contact both sites simultaneously.

to represent a physiological complex (Fig. 5). In this complex, each Hh molecule contacts only a single Ihog molecule, and a pair of 1:1 Hh Ihog complexes forms an entirely Ihog-mediated dimer to produce the 2:2 complex. This arrangement is consistent with the minimal cooperativity observed between Hh Ihog interactions and Ihog dimerization. Ihog dimers are heparindependent and probably constitutive on the cell surface, which may facilitate binding to multimeric forms of Hh through an increase in avidity (32, 33). The observed 2:2 complex is able to accommodate four Ig domains at the IhogFn1­2 N terminus without introducing clashes, and 30 aa intervene between this complex and the cell membrane, rendering its orientation relative to the membrane uncertain. Heparin is also required to mediate IhogFn1­2 HhN interactions and appears to do so by binding to basic regions on Hh and Ihog that are adjacent in the Hh Ihog complex. The dependence of both this interaction and Ihog dimerization on heparin provides a direct mechanism by which Hh responsiveness could be modulated by changes in the availability or nature of heparin or HSPGs. Heparan sulfate and HSPGs have been indirectly implicated in many signaling pathways, but this result demonstrates a direct role for heparin in mediating a highaffinity receptor­ligand interaction, reminiscent of the role of heparin in mediating interactions between fibroblast growth factor and its receptors (34). The crystal structures presented here reveal that no changes in IhogFn1­2 conformation or oligomerization state occur after HhN binding, and it has been demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of Ihog is dispensable for Hh signaling (11). Taken together, these data suggest that a primary role of Ihog is to bind HhN and that signaling must be coordinated with other molecules. Several observations indicate that Ihog and Ptc behave synergistically with respect to HhN binding and signaling (11), and the simplest model explaining all of these data is that HhN forms a ternary complex with Ihog and Ptc, and this complex has a greater affinity for HhN than either Ihog or Ptc alone. The HhN IhogFn1­2 complex characterized here provides a concrete basis for testing this and other models of the role of Ihog in Hh signaling.

fragments encoding D. melanogaster Ihog residues 466­577 (IhogFn1) and 466­679 (IhogFn1­2) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pT7HMT (35). Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3) and purified by immobilized metal ion chromatography (IMAC), cation-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. A fragment of the D. melanogaster Hh gene encoding residues 85­248 (HhN) was subcloned into the pT7HMT vector. Expression and purification were carried out similarly to IhogFn1­2, except that solutions contained -mercaptoethanol to avoid aggregation. The IhogFn1­2 heparin-binding mutant (IhogFn1­2Hep) was created by using megaprimer PCR mutagenesis. Briefly, the substitutions R503E, K507E, K509E, and R547E were introduced during three rounds of PCR, and the mutated gene was subcloned back into pT7HMT as described above. A similar approach was used to create the IhogFn1­2Cys mutant, which contains the T534C and T630C substitutions. For binding assays, protein expression in Drosophila cell culture was driven by the Actin 5C promoter. Expression vectors directing expression of Ptc, Dlp, and Renilla luciferase-tagged HhN were generated as described (13, 36). The HhN Ihog interface mutants were created by using megaprimer PCR mutagenesis. The interface 1 mutant contained four HhN substitutions (V103A, N110A, Y235F, and R238A), and the interface 2 mutant contained three HhN substitutions (D191A, H193A, and Q196A).

The mixture was concentrated to 6 mg ml total protein to which an amount of heparin decasaccharide equimolar with IhogFn1­2 was added.

Heparinase Treatment. Conditioned medium containing HhN-Ren protein was incubated with heparinase (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C for 2 h. Heparinase-treated conditioned medium was cooled down to 4°C before addition to S2-R cells. HhN-Induced Smo Phosphorylation. Drosophila S2-R cells, which produce endogenous Ihog, were plated in 24-well plates and transfected for expression of Smo-HA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with serum-free culture medium and incubated at 25°C for 4 h with conditioned medium containing HhN protein (either heparinase-treated medium or untreated medium) or control medium without HhN protein. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed, and Smo phosphorylation was measured by Western blot using rat polyclonal antibody for HA (Roche). Analytical Ultracentrifugation. All samples were prepared in PBS

ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Samples were studied at rotor speeds of 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26 thousand rpm, and data were acquired at a wavelength of 280 nm or 294 nm. Data collected in the presence of one equivalent of sucrose octasulfate (SOS), heparin hexasaccharide, or decasaccharide, were analyzed globally in terms of a reversible monomer­dimer equilibrium of the 1:1 IhogFn1­2 heparin complex. Sedimentation equilibrium studies measuring the interaction between HhN and IhogFn1­2 were conducted at 4.0°C and 280 nm at rotor speeds of 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 thousand rpm. HhN data, with and without one equivalent of heparin decasaccharide, were collected at 10, 20, and 30 M. HhN IhogFn1­2 mixtures were studied at three different loading ratios (9.3:9.7 M, 13.1:7.0 M and 5.8:12.1 M) in the presence of 50 M heparin decasaccharide. Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted in duplicate at 4.0°C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples (loading volume of 300­350 l) were studied at 280 or 294 nm) of 1.0. One hundred a loading absorbance ( to 120 scans were acquired at 58,000 rpm by using the shortest time delay possible. Molecular modeling used structural data for IhogFn1­2 to calculate the sedimentation coefficient based on a horseshoe model with the program HYDROPRO Version 5A (37). An extended form of IhogFn1­2 was modeled in a similar fashion, as were various IhogFn1­2 and HhN complexes.
Size-Exclusion Chromatography. Mixtures of IhogFn1­2 (63 M), D. melanogaster Hedgehog N-terminal domain (HhN) (62 M), or heparin decasaccharide (190 M) were adjusted to 260 l with PBS and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Approximately 200 l of the solution were then passed through a Superdex 200 10 300 column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, U.K.) equilibrated in PBS at 4°C. Heparin oligosaccharides were purchased from Neoparin (Alameda, CA).
