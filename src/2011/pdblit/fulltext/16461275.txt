interacts with Lamin B, chromatin and HP1. Mutations in LBR cause the Pelger-Huet Anomaly (PHA), which is characterized by loss of nuclear lobulation in granulocytes [20]. The study of the nuclear lamina is becoming more and more exciting, particularly in terms of identifying its roles in regulating the organization and various functions of the nucleus. Different heritable laminopathies are caused by novel mutations in lamina proteins and recently developed drugs, including farnesyl-transferase inhibitors, that ameliorate the cellular phenotypes caused by laminopathies are currently put into clinical trials. Kuk/Char adds an important link to understanding the role of the nuclear lamina in determining nuclear shape, structure and position within the cell, which is relevant for understanding the disease phenotypes. Further work on Kuk/Char and nuclear architecture may provide novel insights into how nuclear structure and position are determined.

Mitochondrial Protein Import: Convergent Solutions for Receptor Structure
Complex machinery has evolved to recognise and import nuclearencoded proteins into mitochondria. Recent work now shows that the plant Tom20 mitochondrial protein import receptor has a similar tertiary structure to animal Tom20, although the proteins are evolutionarily distinct, representing an elegant example of convergent evolution. Ryan Lister and James Whelan Mitochondria are generally accepted to have descended from a eubacterium that was engulfed by an archaebacterial host cell [1,2]. During the evolution of this endosymbiotic relationship, the vast majority of organellar genes were transferred to the nucleus, necessitating an efficient system to import nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins into the organelle [2]. All extant mitochondria possess this protein import machinery, consisting of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex (Figure 1), and two inner mitochondrial membrane complexes [3]. The TOM complex consists of two functionally defined groups of proteins that either form the `general import pore' or act as receptors that facilitate delivery of the precursor protein to the pore [4]. Two apparent obstacles that had to be overcome in order to allow for

Figure 1. The mitochondrial TOM complex in animals, fungi and plants. Mitochondrial proteins interact with the receptors Tom20 and/or Tom70 and are translocated through the import pore. The import components that comprise the ancient core TOM complex (blue) are highly conserved between divergent lineages, in contrast to the other TOM proteins that evolved subsequently, including the receptors. The plant TOM complex shows several significant differences in composition and import component structure. Tom9 in plants represents a truncated form of Tom22 that lacks the amino-terminal cytosolic domain.

mitochondrial protein import were the acquisition of targeting sequences on mitochondrial proteins and the development of the protein import machinery. It is now clear that protein sequences with properties similar to contemporary mitochondrialtargeting sequences are inherent in a significant proportion of existing bacterial proteins, and thus were probably available to the protomitochondria as a resource for use as targeting sequences [5,6]. Furthermore, comparative genomic analyses of diverse phyla indicate a highly conserved group of TOM proteins that comprise a `core TOM complex' (Figure 1), which may have functioned in the absence of receptor proteins early in the evolution of the protein import machinery [7]. This

rudimentary translocase would have been required early in mitochondrial evolution for the proteins encoded by transferred genes to function in the organelle. In contrast to the core TOM complex, the receptor proteins Tom20 and Tom70 are not conserved between highly divergent lineages. Despite high-quality genome sequences, proteins with significant sequence similarity to the animal and fungal Tom20 and Tom70 import receptors could not be identified in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, including plants, alveolates, trypanosomatids, chromists and red algae [8­10]. However, antibodies raised to a 20 kDa protein that co-purifies with the plant TOM complex were

found to inhibit mitochondrial protein import in vitro, suggesting the protein is the plant functional analogue of the animal/fungal Tom20 [11,12]. In a recent issue of Current Biology, Perry et al. [10] present a detailed investigation of the function and three-dimensional structure of the plant Tom20, concluding that functional and structural similarities between the Tom20 receptors found in plants and animals/fungi probably arose via convergent evolution. Perry et al. [10] demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana Tom20 (AtTom20) is functionally equivalent to the animal and fungal Tom20. The receptor domain of AtTom20 can compete with isolated yeast mitochondria for a radiolabelled precursor protein, inhibiting the import of the precursor protein into the yeast mitochondria. Furthermore, incubation of a 15N-labeled mitochondrial-targeting sequence attached to a passenger protein with AtTom20 or yeast Tom20 resulted in similar chemical changes, strongly suggesting that both receptors bound to the same residues in the targeting sequence. NMR spectroscopy of AtTom20 revealed that the three-dimensional structure of the AtTom20 cytosolic domain shows some similarities to the previously solved structure of rat Tom20, but has greater similarity to other tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins [13]. Perry et al. [10] hypothesize that AtTom20 presents a similar threedimensional surface as animal Tom20 for interacting with other TOM complex components. Thus, both AtTom20 and rat Tom20 display similar overall structures. Surprisingly, however, they have each probably evolved from different ancestral TPR proteins. Evidence that the plant and animal Tom20 proteins have distinct evolutionary origins comes from investigation of the domain structure of the receptors (Figure 2). Perry et al. [10] identified several conserved domains in orthologs of AtTom20 that were found in the mosses Physcomitrella patens and

Dispatch R199

Tortula ruralis, and the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardii. This study revealed that the order of the structural domains of plant and animal/fungal Tom20 proteins is only similar when viewed in reverse. AtTom20 is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane by a carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain, in contrast to an amino-terminal domain in animal/fungal Tom20 (Figure 2). Furthermore, the Tom20 transmembrane domains and proximal cytosolic regions from both lineages display striking structural similarities, but only in reverse order. No genetic mechanisms are known that could generate such a reversal in the order of structural domains, strongly suggesting that the animal/fungal and plant Tom20 proteins evolved from two distinct genes after the divergence of the animal and plant lineages. Perry et al. [10] present an elegant example of convergent evolution on a molecular scale, where different organisms adapted distinct proteins to fulfil a function demanded by a similar cellular environment. With only the core import pore present in the early stages of mitochondrial evolution, great selective pressures would have existed to develop a discriminating receptor protein to increase targeting fidelity and import efficiency. In various

species, the hundreds of proteins that had to be imported into mitochondria, possessing similar targeting sequences obtained from the original endosymbiont, probably acted as the driving force that produced the same receptor solution twice. As the process of gene transfer progressed, there was probably an increase in both the complexity of the protein complement targeted to mitochondria and the cellular requirement for an effective protein import apparatus. Tom20 greatly enhances the process of mitochondrial protein import, thus the development of this receptor was perhaps an essential step in the evolution of the relationship between mitochondria and the host cell.

Plant Meristems: The Fiendish SU DOKU of Stem-Cell Maintenance
Three recent studies have uncovered effector mechanisms and novel pathways in the regulation of the dynamic changes to cell behaviour that occur in plant meristems. The results show how exquisite regulation of cell-cycle mechanisms is central to root stem cell homeostasis. Peter Doerner After a plant seed has germinated, all new cells in the growing plant ultimately derive from pluripotent stem cells in the shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem. Stem cells are defined by their capacity for self-renewal and their simultaneous ability to generate cells destined for differentiation, but the details of these central processes are not yet well understood. Three new studies [1­3] have revealed exciting new mechanistic details

of how stem cells are maintained and how they control the switch between fates, including the involvement of cell-cycle mechanisms controlling entry into S-phase. In shoots, stem cells are located at the meristem centre, and their non-differentiated state is maintained by the expression of WUSCHEL (WUS) in an underlying domain, which thus functions as a stem cell niche for the shoot apical meristem. In roots, stem cells surround the cells of the quiescent centre, which expresses the SCARECROW (SCR) gene
