Bacteriophage T4, like all other viruses, is required to be stable while being transmitted from host to host, but also is poised to eject ef®ciently and rapidly its double-stranded DNA genome to initiate infection. The latter is coordinated by the recognition of receptors on Escherichia coli cells by the long tail ®bers and subsequent irreversible attachment by the short tail ®bers. These ®bers are attached to the baseplate, a multi-subunit assembly at the distal end of the tail. Recognition and attachment induce a conformational transition of the baseplate from a hexagonal to a star-shaped structure. The crystal structure of gene product 11 (gp11), a protein that connects Ê the short tail ®bers to the baseplate, has been determined to 2.0 A resolution using multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion with Se. This structure is compared to the trimeric structure of gp9, which connects the baseplate with the long tail ®bers. The structure of gp11 is a trimer with each monomer consisting of 218 residues folded into three domains. The N-terminal domains form a central, trimeric, parallel coiled coil surrounded by the middle ``®nger'' domains. The ®ngers emanate from the carboxy-terminal b-annulus domain, which, by comparison with the T4 whisker ``®britin'' protein, is probably responsible for trimerization. The events leading from recognition of the host to the ejection of viral DNA must be communicated along the assembled trimeric (gp9)3 attached to the long tail ®bers via the trimeric baseplate protein (gp10)3 to the trimeric (gp11)3 and the trimeric short tail ®bers.

Introduction
Investigations of the assembly mechanisms of complex biological structures have been greatly aided by the analysis of bacteriophage T4 morphogenesis (Mathews, 1994). Among the most important discoveries is that the assembly of T4 is not based upon a sequential expression of genes, but rather proceeds via independent pathways that prefabricate different components of the virus, such as phage heads, phage tails, and tail ®bers.

Another signi®cant lesson learned in the study of T4 is that assembly can be directed by selective proteolysis of capsid proteins by the use of speci®c scaffolding proteins and the presence of morphogenetic catalytic proteins, such as the T4-encoded chaperone-like gp31, which interacts with the host GroEL chaperonin. Perhaps particularly surprising is that the DNA genome is packaged into a preassembled prohead. Bacteriophage T4 has an exceptionally complex structure in comparison to other viruses (Eiserling & Black, 1994). Its double-stranded (ds) DNA genome consists of 168,872 base-pairs, which encode for 124 identi®ed gene products as well as another 148 open reading frames of unknown function (Kutter et al., 1994). There are about 40 genes that code for proteins, which form the virion structure. The prolate head of the phage, into which is pack# 2000 Academic Press

976 aged the genome, has icosahedral ends. The bilayered tail consists of an internal rigid tube surrounded by a contractile sheath, a baseplate at the distal end of the tail, six whisker proteins (®britin), six short tail ®bers (STFs), and six long tail ®bers (LTFs; Figure 1). The whiskers (the product of gene wac, i.e. ®britin), the STFs (gene product (gp) 12), and the proximal part of the LTFs (gp34) are all homotrimeric proteins (Makhov et al., 1993; Cerritelli et al., 1996; Tao et al., 1997). Tailed bacterial viruses are especially ef®cient in their ability to infect their host. Whereas a single phage particle is generally suf®cient to infect its bacterial host, numerous particles are generally required by animal viruses to infect a single cell. Infection of Escherichia coli by T4 phage is initiated by the LTFs, which are attached to the baseplate and can reversibly associate with speci®c E. coli surface receptor molecules. The baseplate, which is composed of 15 different proteins with some having multiple copies (Coombs & Arisaka, 1994), has 6fold symmetry, consisting of six wedges and a central tube, or ``hub''. The baseplate is hexagonally shaped when the phage is in solution and has a sixpointed star structure once the phage has attached itself to the host cell surface (Crowther et al., 1977),

demonstrating that attachment of the virus to E. coli induces large, global, conformational changes. This transition, triggered by binding of LTFs to the lipopolysaccharide cell surface receptors, subsequently initiates the unfolding of the STFs for their irreversible attachment to the cell surface, tail sheath contraction, and phage DNA ejection. The signal generated by LTF binding to E. coli is conducted to the baseplate via the connecting ``trigger'' protein, gp9 (Figure 1), whose structure has been determined (Kostyuchenko et al., 1999). The STFs (gp12) are attached to gp11 (Edgar & Lielausis, 1968), which, in turn, is bound to gp10 in the baseplate. Morphologically, gp11 is located near the vertices of the baseplate (Crowther et al., 1977; Figure 1). The last 20 to 40 carboxy-terminal residues of gp11 are required for gp10-gp11 complex formation (Plishker & Berget, 1984). Both gp10 and gp11 exist as trimers in the baseplate (Zhao et al., 2000). The gp11 monomer consists of 219 amino acid residues prior to post-translational cleavage of the N-terminal methionine residue. The amino acid sequence of gp11 has an abundance of charged and polar residues, no cysteine residues, and only two methionine residues (Barrett & Berget, 1989; Prilipov et al., 1989).

977 ecule and is surrounded by the non-crystallographically related three-®nger domains. The ®nger domain (Figures 5 and 6) is a sevenstranded, antiparallel, skewed b-roll with one ahelix. The well-separated three ®ngers hold helix a2 of the N-terminal domain in a hydrophobic pocket (Figure 6). The DALI algorithm for comparing atomic structures, based on the Holm & Sander (1993) data base, found 44 protein structures with a Z-score greater than 2.0 in a search for structures with topologies similar to gp11. However, manual inspection of the superpositions of the highest-scoring structures showed no obvious, identi®able folding motif when viewed visually. Analysis of these results with the HOMOlogy program (Rao & Rossmann, 1973; Rossmann & Argos, 1975) was consistent with the manual observation. The crystallographic temperature factor distribution shows a larger mobility for one of the ®nger domains than for the other two in the trimer (Figure 7). The mobility of the latter two monomers is restricted by the lattice contacts. Nevertheless, the r.m.s. difference between Ca atoms does not suggest any signi®cant structural difference in the main-chain conformations of the monomers. This asymmetry might be an essential biological function, because gp11 participates in the baseplate conformational transition by ¯exing its ®ngers and allowing the STF to unfold, a process that would require asymmetric gp11 properties. Ala142 is at the N-terminal end of strand b6 in the ®nger domain and is close to the central coiled coil. Its strained conformation may be associated with some ¯exibility of the ®nger domain. The 3-fold-related C-terminal domains of gp11 generate a 3-fold b-annulus (Harrison et al., 1978; Abad-Zapatero et al., 1980; Figure 8) to which are attached the ®ngers. The bacteriophage T4 ®britin has a similar 3-fold b-annulus structure (Figure 8), which was shown to be essential for trimerization (Tao et al., 1997; Letarov et al., 1999). The formation of this structure is promoted by inter-C-terminal domain hydrogen bonds within the trimer (Figure 9). The hydrogen-bonding network of the C-terminal domain of gp11 is more extensive than

When recombinant gp11 protein is added to 11À phage particles (which lack both the STFs and gp11 (Edgar & Lielausis, 1968; Crowther et al., 1977)), the non-infectious particles are converted into infectious virions (L. P. K. and V. V. M., unpublished results) that are able to attach to the host. The crystal structure of the biologically active, Ê recombinant gp11, determined to 2.0 A resolution, Ê is reported here. The initial phases to 2.5 A resolution were determined with multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data, using Se-methionine in the place of the S-methionine residues.

Results and Discussion
The Structure The structure of gp11 was determined by using the MAD technique in a situation where the proportion of methionine to other residues was only about half that found usually for soluble proteins. In spite of the resultant small anomalous dispersion signal, the MAD phasing, together with subsequent cycles of solvent ¯attening, resulted in a high-quality electron density map (Figure 2). The re®ned atomic model of gp11 consists of 208 out of 218 amino acid residues (Ser12 to Ala219). The ®rst ten residues were disordered in the crystal structure. Gp11 was found to associate into a trimeric protein with approximate overall dimensions of Ê Ê Ê 78 A Â 78 A Â 72 A. Each monomer consists of the N-terminal domain (residues 12 to 64), the middle or ``®nger'' domain (residues 80 to 188), and the Cterminal domain (residues 65 to 79 and 189 to 219; Figure 3). The structure consists of four a-helices (a1 to a4) and 12 b-strands (b1 to b12). The Nterminal domain of gp11 is mainly a-helical, with helix a3 making a parallel, trimeric coiled coil with the other monomers. The coiled coil is 12 residues in length, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between 3-fold-related Ile52 at ``d`` positions, Ile56 at ``a`` positions, and Val59 at the subsequent ``d`` positions of the heptad repeats (abcdefg)(abcdefg) (Figure 4). This domain is at the center of the mol-

in ®britin, extending over three instead of two antiparallel strands and involving seven instead of three residues in the central hydrogen-bonding arrangement. This creates a central constriction of Ê van der Waals' radius 2.8 A. The large volume enclosed by the annulus in gp11 is ®lled by at least 18 ordered water molecules. There is an external hydrophobic region on each annulus in both structures, which may be required for folding. These similarities suggest that this domain is essential for trimerization for ®britin and for gp11. Functional requirements for the virus gp11 is required for attachment of the STFs to the baseplate (Edgar & Lielausis, 1968). gp9, the LTF-baseplate connector protein, like gp11, is a homotrimer consisting of three domains: an Nterminal, a-helical, coiled-coil domain; a middle, seven-stranded, b-sandwich domain; and a C-terminal, eight-stranded, antiparallel, b-barrel domain. The LTFs bind to the N-terminal domain of gp9, while its C-terminal domain is buried in the baseplate and is responsible for trimerization (Kostyuchenko et al., 1999). The sequence of folding motifs within the three domains of gp11 is similar to that in gp9. The N-terminal domains of both gp9 (Kostyuchenko et al., 1999) and gp11 are a-helical, creating parallel, trimeric, coiled coils. The C-terminal domains consist of b-structure with multiple intermonomeric contacts. These comparisons suggest that the coiled-coil domains of gp11 might bind the trimeric STFs in the same way as

gp9 binds the LTFs (Kostyuchenko et al., 1999). The C-terminal domains of both gp9 and gp11 are, therefore, probably buried within the baseplate and the central domains permit some degree of ¯exibility. Both in gp9 and gp11, the N-terminal, coiled-coil structure is preceded by a disordered sequence of ten to 20 residues. As this part of the structure is involved in binding to the trimeric LTFs and STFs, respectively, the disorder of the initial part of the structure may be important for the conformational changes required to generate a suitable binding site. The monomer-monomer interactions within the gp11 trimer are created by the coiled coil in the N-terminal domain (Figure 4), the hydrophobic pocket in the ®nger domain (Figure 6), and the hydrogen bonds in the b-annulus of the C-terminal domain (Figure 9). Remarkable is the accurate alignment, in both gp9 and gp11, of the 3fold axes that occur between equivalent domains in the trimer, in spite of the ¯exibility of the connecting residues between domains. The baseplate protein gp10 forms a stable (gp10)3(gp11)3 complex with gp11 (Zhao et al., 2000). gp10 is the ®rst protein in the assembly pathway of the baseplate wedge (Kikuchi & King, 1975) and, therefore, initiates the alignment of (gp9)3 on one side and (gp11)3 on the other. It has been shown that gp11 lacking its C terminus does not associate with gp10 (Plishker & Berget, 1984). Thus, the C-terminal domain of gp11 is required for trimerization of gp11, and forms the interface in the gp10-gp11 interaction. Therefore, initial

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification, and crystallization DNA, encoding gp11, was subcloned into the pET22b() expression vector (Novagen) and transformed into the BL21 (DE3) strain of E. coli (Studier et al., 1990). The protein was puri®ed with a hydroxyapatite column (BioRad, USA). Like gp9 (Kostyuchenko et al., 1999), gp11 was found to have biological activity in in vitro complementation assays of T4 gp11À defective particles. The Se-methionine-substituted (SeMet) protein was expressed in the B834 (DE3) strain of E. coli, which is a methionine-requiring auxotroph (Ramakrishnan et al., 1993). The modi®ed M9 medium used for expression of the SeMet protein contained each amino acid at a concentration of 40 mg mlÀ1, the EAGLE medium vitamin complex (ICN, USA) at 1 mg mlÀ1, 0.4 % (w/v) glucose, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and ampicillin at 200 mg mlÀ1. Crystals of gp11 were obtained using the Crystal Screen II kit (Hampton Research, USA). Hanging drops containing equal volumes (2 ml) of gp11 at 40 mg mlÀ1 in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 35 % (v/v) dioxane were equilibrated against a similar well solution. The rapid oxidation of Se was reduced when growing crystals of the SeMet protein by adding tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Han & Han, 1994) into the crystallization drop and well solutions to a ®nal concentration of 1 mM. Two crystals were used in the structure determination, one for collecting the native data and one for collecting the SeMet data. The crystals were washed in the cryoprotectant solution (35 % dioxane, 25 % (w/v) ethylene glycol) and then immediately ¯ash frozen at 100 K. The native and SeMet crystals belonged to space group P212121, Ê with average cell dimensions of a  63.90(Æ0.02) A, Ê Ê b  99.33(Æ0.07) A, and c  129.85(Æ0.15) A. The MatÊ thews coef®cient was 2.78 A3/Da, if it is assumed that there are three monomers per asymmetric unit. The diffraction data (Table 1) were indexed and integrated with DENZO and merged with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997).

Structure determination Data sets were collected at four different wavelengths (l4 > l1 > l2 > l3; Tables 1 and 2). The positions of ®ve Se atoms in the asymmetric unit were determined from the dispersive and Bijvoet difference Pattersons (Rossmann, 1960). The dispersive and Bijvoet differences were combined (Matthews, 1966; R. L. Kingston, personal communication) to produce coef®cients for a modi®ed Patterson summation. The summation gave a map similar to the dispersive and Bijvoet difference Patterson maps but with reduced noise, allowing the location of a sixth Se atom. The parameters of the Se atoms and phases were re®ned with the program MLPHARE Ê (Otwinowski, 1991), using 25.0 to 3.0 A resolution data (Table 2). Solvent-¯attening and histogram matching, but without non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, using the program DM (Cowtan, 1994), improved the electron density map. The resultant electron density map (Figure 2) was interpreted, using the programs MAPMAN (Kleywegt & Jones, 1996) and O (Jones et al., 1991),

to build an atomic model for all residues between Leu14 and Ala219 in each independent monomer. The crystallographic re®nement of the three independent monomers in the atomic model was accomplished with the native Ê data collected at 0.9161 A, using the CNS program È (Brunger et al., 1998) with the maximum likelihood target function (Adams et al., 1997), using restraint geometry with Engh & Huber (1991) targets. Ser12 and Arg13 were added to each monomer towards the end of re®nement. Eventually, 425 water molecules and 4782 nonhydrogen atoms were positioned, giving ®nal R and Rfree values of 0.208 and 0.229, respectively. The r.m.s. deviation of bond lengths and bond angles from idealized Ê values were 0.005 A and 1.21  , respectively. All residues are in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (as de®ned in the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993)) except for Ala142 in each of the three independent polypeptide chains (f  61.0(Æ0.8) , c  À 37.6(Æ4.5) ). A pairwise least-squares superposition of the molecules shows that there is a quasi-3-fold axis with a rotation of 118.7  , 120.7  , and 120.6  and r.m.s. differences between
