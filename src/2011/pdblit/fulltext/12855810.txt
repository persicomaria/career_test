Thrombin bound to platelets contributes to stop bleeding and, in pathological conditions, may cause vascular thrombosis. We have determined the structure of platelet glycoprotein Ib (GpIb ) bound to thrombin at 2.3 angstrom resolution and defined two sites in GpIb that bind to exosite II and exosite I of two distinct -thrombin molecules, respectively. GpIb occupancy may be sequential, as the site binding to -thrombin exosite I appears to be cryptic in the unoccupied receptor but exposed when a first thrombin molecule is bound through exosite II. These interactions may modulate -thrombin function by mediating GpIb clustering and cleavage of protease-activated receptors, which promote platelet activation, while limiting fibrinogen clotting through blockade of exosite I. Thrombin generated in damaged blood vessels triggers procoagulant responses that arrest bleeding as well as anticoagulant mechanisms that limit thrombus growth (1). Specific interactions with vascular cells regulate these opposite functions. Thus, platelets adherent to injured tissues provide a surface for the assembly of the prothrombinase complex that leads to the generation of - thrombin, which in turn clots fibrinogen (2, 3) and induces platelet aggregation by signaling through proteaseactivated receptors (PARs) (4, 5). In contrast, -thrombin bound to endothelial cell thrombomodulin (6 ) initiates the protein C pathway that inhibits clotting (7 ). In diseased arteries, unstable atherosclerotic plaques may favor prothrombotic activities that result in platelet and fibrin deposition occluding the vascular lumen, as in the case of myocardial infarction and stroke (8).

Glycoprotein Ib (GpIb ) (9) in the GP Ib-IX-V receptor complex is the major binding site for -thrombin associated with

platelets (10), and through this function may support procoagulant activities (11) and contribute to platelet activation and aggregation (12, 13). Here we demonstrate that -thrombin binding to GpIb involves two distinct receptor sites that interact with two different ligand molecules, possibly in a sequential process. Our observations provide a structural framework that could explain prothrombotic responses of platelets through receptor clustering and activation, as well as inhibition of clotting by blockade of the fibrinogen-binding exosite I in -thrombin. The amino- (N-) terminal domain of GpIb comprising residues 1 to 290 (GpIb N) recapitulates the properties of the intact platelet receptor with respect to von Willebrand factor (14, 15) and -thrombin (16) binding. We mixed GpIb N at a 1:1.5 stoichiometric ratio with purified -thrombin that had the proteolytic site blocked with D-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethylketone (PPACK) (17). Analysis by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated formation of the GpIb N: -thrombin complex, which we separated from excess un-

Fig. 1. A stereo view of the interaction between GpIb N (red) and two -thrombin molecules. The interaction with thrombin I (blue) involves the anion-binding exosite I (Ex I); that with thrombin II (green), the anion-binding exosite II (Ex II). GpIb N residues participating in substantial interactions are shown in ball-and-stick representation (magenta). The catalytic triad (His57, Asp102, and Ser195) in each thrombin molecule is shown in red. The position of the inhibitor peptide, PPACK, is shown as a short arrow (gray). Thrombin I and thrombin II are related by crystallographic symmetry. Similarly, two symmetry-related GpIb N molecules interact with exosite I and exosite II of the same thrombin, suggesting a potential mode for cross-linking of GpIb on the platelet surface.

bound -thrombin using gel permeation chromatography. Crystals displayed the symmetry of the P43212 space group, and the x-ray diffraction data extended to 2.3 Å resolution (Table 1). The structure of the complex was determined with molecular replacement techniques based on the structures of GpIb N (Protein Data Bank accession no. 1P9A) and -thrombin (18). Because the apparent mass of the complex purified by gel permeation chromatography was compatible with a 1:1 molecular ratio, and the unit cell volume accounted for one GpIb N and one -thrombin molecule per asymmetric unit, we expected to observe one -thrombin bound to each GpIb N. Instead, two symmetry-related -thrombin molecules in the crystal lattice interacted with a single GpIb N at two distinct sites located near the carboxyl- (C-) terminal end of the fragment (Fig. 1). This region in the native receptor is where the transition occurs between the N-terminal domain and the carbohydrate-rich, mucin-like domain (19). The interactions occurred without causing substantial changes in the native conformation of -thrombin, including the PPACK-blocked active site of the protease. Taking into account only the residues with the potential for strong interactions and interatomic distances of 4 Å or less, we found that 25 residues of -thrombin, 6 of which are part of anion-binding exosite I (18), form what we define as the GpIb -binding site I (Fig. 2A) and that 11 residues of the symmetry- related -thrombin in the complex, 5 of which are part of anionbinding exosite II (18), form the GpIb -binding site II (Fig. 2B). In GpIb , 25 residues interact with the two -thrombin molecules; 19 of these (Glu151, Lys152, Glu172, Asn173, Asp175, Ser194, His195, Leu196, Pro198, Arg218, Asp222, Asn223, Asn226, Thr 273, Pro280, Glu281, Glu282, Asp283, and Thr284) interact only with site I in one molecule, 3 (Asp , Leu , and Asp277) only with site II in a different molecule, and 3 (Tyr 276-sulfated, Tyr 278, and Tyr 279-sulfated) interact with both (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, most of the GpIb residues that bind exclusively to -thrombin site I are located in three leucinerich repeats (VI, VII, and VIII) and one helix (20, 21) and interact with two loops of -thrombin that comprise Arg35-Leu40 and Leu64-Met84 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the negatively charged region near the C terminus of GpIb N, which contains sulfated tyrosine residues, plays a key role in the interaction with both anionbinding exosites of -thrombin (Fig. 2, A and B). The two - thrombin molecules bound to one GpIb N establish substantial contacts between themselves and assume a dimer configuration that involves 13 residues in one molecule and 9 in the other, with 7.6% of the thrombin surface buried in the interaction (fig. S1). Similar contacts between symmetry-related molecules have been reported in the structure of PPACKthrombin (18). No conformational changes occur in most of the GpIb molecule upon binding -thrombin, with the notable exception of the region comprising the Tyr 276-Asp277Tyr 278-Tyr 279 sequence. Uff and co-workers (20) observed that this portion of uncomplexed GpIb N is in the close vicinity of the -helical region between Ile213 and Asn223. In particular, Tyr 279 is in close contact with Arg217, Arg218, and Gln221, and its sulfate group, which interacts with exosite I when -thrombin is bound, is 2.9 Å away from the guanidinium group of Arg217. In such a conformation, Tyr 279 is not available for establishing contacts with other molecules. In contrast, the distance between the sulfate group of Tyr 279 and the guanidinium group of Arg217 increases to 24 Å when -thrombin exosite II is bound to GpIb N (fig. S2). This conformational change suggests that the mechanism of -thrombin binding to GpIb involves the sequential engagement of two sites. Accordingly, we propose that Tyr 276, which is exposed to solvent on the surface of uncomplexed GpIb (20), participates with other neighboring, negatively charged residues in establishing the first contact with the anion-binding exosite II of an -thrombin molecule. Particularly important in this regard is the role of Asp277, which establishes nine hydrophilic contacts of 4 Å or less with residues in -thrombin, including Arg101, Arg233, and Asn179 (Fig. 2B). Once established, the interaction with -thrombin exosite II causes the C-terminal region to be dislodged from the main body of GpIb N, allowing Tyr 279 to participate with other residues in the binding of a second -thrombin molecule through exosite I. This mechanism of sequential binding is compatible with the ob274 275

served crystal structure of the GpIb N: thrombin complex as compared to that of free GpIb N, but remains a hypothesis that requires more experimental work to be validated. The proposed model (Fig. 3) explains why mutations of key residues in exosite II may inhibit -thrombin binding completely and justifies the apparent contradiction in previous reports that indicated a role for either exosite I (22) or exosite II (23, 24) in mediating -thrombin binding to GpIb . Experiments conducted with synthetic peptides (25, 26) previously indicated that the minimal GpIb sequence that gives maximal inhibition of -thrombin binding to platelets included the residues from Gly271 to Glu285. Indeed, it is now apparent that residues Thr273, Glu281, Glu282, Asp283, and Thr284 interact with exosite I in one thrombin molecule; residues Asp274, Leu275, and Asp277 interact with exosite II in a different thrombin molecule; and residues Tyr 276, Tyr 278, and Tyr 279 interact with both thrombin molecules. Thus, the information derived from the structure of -thrombin in complex with the N-terminal fragment of GpIb appears to reflect the mechanism of the corresponding ligand-receptor interaction on intact platelets. The binding mediated by exosite I should be stronger because it involves 9.4% of the -thrombin surface (9.2% of GpIb N) as compared to 3.6% for that mediated by exosite II (3.5% of GpIb N) and consequently should have a slower dissociation rate. At equilibrium, therefore, more -thrombin molecules could be bound to GpIb through exosite I than through exosite II, even though the latter interaction may be initially predominant (Fig. 3). This could explain the substantial reduction in binding to GpIb caused by inhibition of -thrombin exosite I (22). The model is compatible with the observation that sulfation of Tyr 276 and Tyr 279 is required for -thrombin binding to GpIb , because substitutions at these positions with phenylalanine, which is highly homologous to tyrosine but cannot be sulfated, resulted in a complete abrogation of the interaction (16 ). In contrast, substitution of Tyr 278 with phenylalanine did not abolish binding but only reduced it partially (16 ), which agrees with the finding that we could obtain a complex between - thrombin and GpIb N even when Tyr 278 was not sulfated (fig. S3). Experimental evidence indicates that all three tyrosine residues at positions 276, 278, and 279 in human platelet GpIb are sulfated (27 ). The demonstration of two distinct binding sites for -thrombin on GpIb prompted us to verify whether complexes with a stoichiometry different from 1:1 could form in solution. To this end, we mixed -thrombin and purified GpIb N in a 4:1 ratio, separated the complexes by gel permeation chromatography, and analyzed the GpIb N and -thrombin content in each collected fraction. Complexes exhibited elution times

Fig. 2. (A) A stereo diagram showing the interactions between GpIb N and thrombin I. Residues that participate in hydrogen bonding or salt-bridge interactions are shown. GpIb N residues are drawn and labeled in red. -Thrombin residues are drawn in blue and labeled in black. A substantial number of GpIb N residues that interact are negatively charged. This includes the two sulfated tyrosine residues (Tyr S276 and Tyr S279) and seven acidic amino acids (Glu151, Glu172, Asp175, Asp222, Glu281, Glu282, and Asp283), whereas only two basic residues of GpIb N (Lys152 and Arg218) take part in hydrophilic interactions. In contrast, five residues of -thrombin that participate in hydrophilic interactions are basic (Arg73, Arg77a, Lys81, Lys110, and Lys145), whereas one residue (Glu39) is acidic. Thus, electrostatic interactions play an important role in binding. The main-chain carbonyls (red) and amides (blue) participating in interprotein hydrogen bonds are also shown. For clarity, only the residues participating in relatively strong interactions are depicted here. (B) A stereo diagram showing the interactions between GpIb N and thrombin II. GpIb N residues are drawn and labeled in red. -Thrombin residues are drawn in green and labeled in black. Interacting GpIb N residues include two sulfated tyrosines and the acidic residues Asp274 and Asp277. Additionally, four carbonyls of Asp274, Leu275, Tyr 276, and Tyr 278 from the C-terminal region of GpIb N also contact thrombin. The first three contact the guanidinium group of Arg233, and the last one contacts the guanidinium group of Arg101. The -thrombin residues that interact strongly are mostly basic (Arg101, Arg126, Arg233, and Lys240) and are part of the anion-binding exosite II. Two of these residues, Arg101 and Arg233, have very strong interactions with GpIb N through multiple contacts. The strongest interactions of exosite II with the GpIb N are to residues Asp277 and Tyr 276 and to the four carbonyls listed above. Additionally, the carbonyl of Arg233 forms a main chain­main chain hydrogen bond with the amide of Asp277 in GpIb . Hence, the participation of main-chain atoms in hydrogen bonding is quite substantial at this site. The inhibitor peptide PPACK is shown as a short strand (gray).

compatible with a molecular mass between 60 and 130 kD or larger (Fig. 4A). In the range of 60 kD, the -thrombin:GpIb N ratio was 1:1, but in the range of 92 kD the ratio was 2:1, indicating two -thrombin molecules bound to

each GpIb molecule. Complexes larger than 92 kD were present in a relatively small amount and had a molecular ratio that approached 1.5; thus they were likely mixtures of different species containing multiple -thrombin and GpIb mol-

Fig. 3. Schematic drawing of the proposed sequential mode of -thrombin binding to platelets. In unoccupied GpIb , the site interacting with -thrombin exosite II is exposed and that interacting with exosite I is cryptic. Thus, the interaction always initiates with GpIb binding to exosite II of an -thrombin molecule; then, a second -thrombin can bind through exosite I. When the latter interaction takes place, fibrinogen clotting is impaired (noted by an on -thrombin). Subsequent dissociation or new associations create the possibility for several different complex forms between GpIb and -thrombin, some of which are shown here. It is assumed that the interaction mediated through -thrombin exosite I is more stable than that through exosite II. On the platelet surface, where GpIb is membrane-bound, one -thrombin molecule can cross-link two adjacent receptors.

Fig. 4. (A) Functional analysis of GpIb N: thrombin complexes. Purified -thrombin and GpIb N were mixed at a 4 :1 mass ratio and incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. The proteins in the mixture were then separated by gel permeation chromatography with a fast-flow Superdex-200 (Pharmacia) column. The molecular size markers used to calibrate the retention time as a function of molecular mass were fibronectin (450 kD), immunoglobulin G (166 kD), bovine serum albumin (67 kD), ovalbumin (43 kD), and lysozyme (14.6 kD). The flow rate in the column was 0.5 ml/min and fractions were collected every 0.25 min. The content of GpIb N and -thrombin in each fraction was then analyzed by reversedphase, high-performance liquid chromatography with a gradient of acetonitrile in trifluoroacetic acid, under conditions that separated the two proteins completely. The respective concentrations were determined from the area under the curve of each protein peak on the basis of calibration curves obtained with known amounts of the two proteins. (B) The clotting activity of -thrombin was measured with a substrate of purified human fibrinogen at a concentration of 375 g/ml. The mass:activity ratio was calculated from the measured -thrombin concentration and the known specific activity of the purified enzyme (2968 NIH units/mg). [One NIH unit clots a standard fibrinogen solution (1 mg/ml) in 15 s at 37°C.] The results presented here were reproducible in three separate experiments.

ecules in varying proportion. These results could indicate that -thrombin has the potential to cluster GpIb (Fig. 3). The clotting activity

of -thrombin was markedly lower when complexes with GpIb had a greater than 1:1 ratio (Fig. 4B), possibly because more molecules of the protease were engaged to the receptor through the fibrinogen-binding exosite I, which is required to mediate normal clotting. In contrast, the platelet-aggregating activity of -thrombin was enhanced above the expected values in the same fractions that had the lowest clotting activity. Thus, in the complexes eluting between 26 and 27 min, which had an average - thrombin:GpIb N ratio of 2.1 (Fig. 4), the measured clotting activity was 26% of that expected on the basis of the -thrombin concentration, but the corresponding platelet-aggregating activity was 157% of that expected. Our findings are in agreement with the results of a previous study (28), which demonstrated that the binding of thrombin to GpIb accelerates PAR-1 hydrolysis on intact platelets. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate the existence on platelet GpIb of two binding sites for -thrombin. One of these establishes extensive contacts with the functionally relevant anion-binding exosite I and can thus modulate fibrinogen clotting, but is available for binding only after an independent site is occupied by the anionbinding exosite II of another thrombin. The binding of distinct -thrombin molecules to two sites on GpIb creates the possibility for cross-linking of the receptor on the platelet membrane. Ramakrishnan et al. have identified a thrombin receptor function for platelet GpIb-IX that is unmasked by cleavage of GpV but is in itself independent of proteolytic activity (13). It is tempting to speculate that this function may result from the thrombin-mediated crosslinking of GpIb on the platelet surface through the mechanism elucidated by our crystallographic and functional studies. The results presented here, therefore, indicate the possibility for at least two divergent consequences resulting from -thrombin binding to GpIb . Cross-linking of the receptor may contribute to platelet activation and aggregation, which are prothrom-
