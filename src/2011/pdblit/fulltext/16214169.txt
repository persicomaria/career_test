Sequence analysis indicates that acylpeptide hydrolases share a strong resemblance in their C-terminal domains, which is thought to reflect their peptidase activity (Barrett and Rawlings, 1992; Rawlings et al., 1991). To date, human, porcine, and rat acylpeptide hydrolases from various tissues have been characterized (Kobayashi et al., 1989; Mitta et al., 1996; Miyagi et al., 1995). All are 732 amino acids in length, share more than 90% sequence identity with each other, and are reported to form homotetramers. The catalytic residues in human and porcine enzymes have been identified by chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis experiments (Mitta et al., 1998; Scaloni et al., 1992). A deficiency in the expression of human APH has been linked with small cell lung carcinomas and renal carcinomas (Erlandsson et al., 1991; Naylor et al., 1989), while APH in porcine brain has been identified as a sensitive site for reaction with organophosphorus compounds and is a potential target for cognitive enhancing drugs (Richards et al., 2000). Further evidence suggests that APH may be a more sensitive target for cognitive-enhancing organophosphorus compounds than acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Duysen et al., 2001; Richards et al., 2000). As such, the acylpeptide hydrolases have a high potential for drug discovery. An acylpeptide hydrolase from the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii has also been characterized, but is 100 residues shorter than its mammalian counterparts and forms a homodimer (Ishikawa et al., 1998). Despite advances in understanding the biological functions of acylpeptide hydrolases, little is known of the structural basis for the sequential deacetylation of N-terminally acetylated proteins. Human APH has been crystallized, but the structure is still unavailable today (Freese et al., 1993). Recently, suitable crystals of an APH from the thermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix K1 (apAPH) were obtained for structure determination (Wang et al., 2002, 2003). Aeropyrum pernix K1 is an aerobic strain classified as crenarchaeota in archaeon (Sako et al., 1996); the complete genome of A. pernix K1 has been sequenced, and four genes (Ape1547, Ape1832, Ape2290, and Ape2441) have been designated as encoding acylpeptide hydrolases. This paper describes the structure of apAPH, the gene product of ° Ape1547, to 2.1 A resolution. Although apAPH shares only 27% sequence identity with human acylpeptide hydrolase, there is a surprising conservation of secondary structure between eukaryotic APH proteins and apAPH. We have also determined the structure of apAPH in complex with an organophosphorus (OP) substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNP). Serine proteases share common inhibitors and have the potential to react with OP compounds, and so the complex of apAPH with pNP should provide a structural basis for the design of specific inhibitors for acylpeptide hydrolases.

Summary Acylpeptide hydrolases (APH; also known as acylamino acid releasing enzyme) catalyze the removal of an N-acylated amino acid from blocked peptides. The crystal structure of an APH from the thermophilic arch° aeon Aeropyrum pernix K1 to 2.1 A resolution confirms it to be a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases. The structure of apAPH is a symmetric homodimer with each subunit comprised of two domains. The N-terminal domain is a regular sevenbladed -propeller, while the C-terminal domain has a canonical / hydrolase fold and includes the active site and a conserved Ser445-Asp524-His556 catalytic triad. The complex structure of apAPH with an organophosphorus substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, has also been determined. The complex structure unambiguously maps out the substrate binding pocket and provides a basis for substrate recognition by apAPH. A conserved mechanism for protein degradation from archaea to mammals is suggested by the structural features of apAPH. Introduction Acylpeptide hydrolases (APH; also known as acylamino acid releasing enzyme or acylaminoacyl peptidase [EC3.4.19.1]) catalyze the removal of an N-acylated amino acid from blocked peptides (Tsunasawa et al., 1975). Peptide substrates of various sizes and with different acyl groups at the N terminus (acetyl, formyl, and chloroacetyl) can be hydrolyzed by APH to generate an acyl amino acid and a peptide with a free N terminus that is shortened by one amino acid. Acetylation occurs during or following the biosynthesis of the polypeptide chains, suggesting that this process protects the intracellular proteins from proteolysis (Hershko et al., 1984). Acylpeptide hydrolases are also active on small acetylated bioactive peptides, such as -endorphin and

Results and Discussion Structure Determination The structure of apAPH was determined by MAD phasing from a selenomethionyl derivative. Data sets were collected at peak, edge, and remote wavelengths on beamline BL41XU of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The crystal contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The quality of the experimental electron density map was good such that residues 8­581 of chain A and residues 8­581 of chain B could be traced continuously. No density was observed for residues 1­7 and 582. The final model consists of 1148 residues, 580 water molecules, 2 -octyl glucoside molecules, and 2 glycerol molecules. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The structure of the apAPH-pNP complex was determined from a single crystal by molecular replacement, ° using data collected in-house to 2.7 A resolution. Clear electron density for the substrate was observed from |Fc| difference map in the binding pocket of an |Fo| each subunit. Continuous electron density was observed for residues 9­581 of chain A and 9­581 of chain B. The final model consists of 1146 residues, 181 water molecules, and 2 pNP molecules. Structural Overview The structure of apAPH is a symmetric homodimer, and each subunit is comprised of two domains (Figures 1

and 2A). The N-terminal domain (residues 24­324) is a -propeller with seven blades; each blade consists of a four-stranded antiparallel sheet. The C-terminal domain (residues 325­581) has a canonical / hydrolase fold, with a central eight-strand mixed sheet flanked by five helices on one side and six helices on the other. This central sheet is all parallel with the exception of the second strand. A short helix at the N-terminal (residues 8­23) extends from the -propeller domain and forms part of the hydrolase domain. Between the ° domains is a large cavity approximately 45 A in width, which is accessible via a tunnel in the -propeller domain. Three prolines--Pro312, Pro359, and Pro370--in each protomer are in the cis conformation. Interestingly, the structure includes a detergent molecule, -octyl glucoside, bound within the central cavity of each subunit. The detergent molecule, added during crystallization, does not bind to the active Ser445 but instead forms a single hydrogen bond with the O atom of Ser26. Further hydrophobic contacts are made with residues Phe41, Val46, Phe381, Ile558, Ala564, and Leu568. A glycerol molecule is also found within the central channel of the -propeller in each subunit. Coordination of the glycerol occurs via hydrogen bonds with Ser157 and Leu251 and hydrophobic contacts with Ser199, Ala200 and Trp250. A DALI (Holm and Sander, 1998) search for structural similarity confirms that the overall architecture of apAPH most resembles prolyl oligopeptidase (POP; PDB ID

Crystal Structure of apAPH 1483

Hydrophobic interactions are mediated by residues positioned on helices 1, 11, and 12. In contrast to acylpeptide hydrolases from A. pernix K1 and P. horikoshii, which form homodimers, their mammalian counterparts have been reported to form homotetramers. A multiple sequence alignment shows that the residues in the dimer interface are conserved in mammalian enzymes, suggesting a common mode of dimer formation. Unlike the archaeal enzymes, however, the mammalian enzymes all possess a large hydrophobic insertion near the N-terminal, which may be involved in higher oligomer formation similar to DPP-IV (Engel et al., 2003). Lack of this N-terminal insertion may explain why apAPH forms a dimer rather than a tetramer. -Propeller Domain The N-terminal domain (residues 24­324) is a regular -propeller consisting of seven blades, each of which is made up of four antiparallel strands (Figure 2C). Blade III is the single exception since it has an additional fifth strand due to crosslinking from blade II. The sheets are twisted and radially arranged around a pseudo 7-fold axis such that they pack face to face. The central tunnel of the -propeller is lined with hydrogen donors and acceptors, which are water solvated. The -propeller is connected to the catalytic domain via two polypeptide main chains. The two domains are stabilized by 29 hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, with additional stability provided by hydrophobic forces. Internal structural stability is provided predominantly by hydrophobic interactions. There is also a high frequency of charged residues (Arg and Glu) located on the end of strands in the -propeller domain, resulting in the formation of 12 ion pairs between neighboring blades. These ion pairs may be a contributory factor to the high thermostability of apAPH. It is worth noting that five of the seven blades have an aspartate residue (Asp52, Asp119, Asp140, Asp224, and Asp274) located on the end of the third strand. A similar motif is found in the -propeller domain of POP (Fulop et al., 1998). The significance of this aspartate motif is not clear, but in both structures, the aspartates are directed into solvent. While the primary sequence similarity between -propeller domains is generally low, their three-dimensional structures can be closely superimposed. The apAPH -propeller domain is more regular and compact than the POP propeller, with an rmsd between them ° of 2.7 A. It more closely resembles the seven-bladed propellers of Integrin V 3 (PDB ID 1JV2) or G protein ° ° (PDB ID 1TBG), with respective rmsds of 1.9 A and 2.1 A. A number of -propeller domain structures have evolved ways to close the circle between the first and last blades, including covalent bonds between the first and last blades, or by strand exchange between the first and last blades. The apAPH -propeller is not stabilized in this way, and only hydrophobic interactions exist between the first and last blades. Catalytic Domain The catalytic domain has a canonical / -hydrolase fold and spans residues 8­23 and 325­581 (Figure 2D). The central eight-stranded sheet is all parallel, with the exception of the second strand, and is twisted by more

1QFM) (Fulop et al., 1998) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV/ CD26 (DPP-IV; PDB ID 1ORV) (Engel et al., 2003), both of which are members of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases. As with apAPH, both structures possess an N-terminal -propeller domain and a C-terminal / hydrolase domain. The -propeller domain of POP features seven blades, whereas the corresponding domain of DPP-IV has eight blades. Unsurprisingly, similarities were also found between the C-terminal domain of apAPH and other esterase structures sharing the same hydrolase fold, including bacterial cocaine esterase (Larsen et al., 2002). Dimerization The structure of apAPH is a symmetric dimer in which the two subunits are related by a 2-fold rotation axis (Figure 2B). Protomers A and B are essentially similar, ° with an rmsd between them of 0.4 A for all C atoms. The dimer interface is located exclusively in the C-terminal hydrolase domain, and the total surface area buried by ° the dimer is 2060 A2. The subunits are arranged such that the central hydrolase sheet of one subunit forms an extension of the central hydrolase sheet of the second subunit. Hydrogen bonds are formed between strand 37 of each subunit by the residues Lys544, Thr545, Phe546, Ala548, His549, Ile550, and Asp553. Additional hydrogen bonds are formed between residues located on the N-terminal 1 helix (Ser10, Glu17) of one subunit and helix 11 (Gln522) of its partner subunit.

than 90 in line with other serine proteases (Figure 2D). The central sheet is flanked by six helices on one side and five helices on the other. The primary sequence of apAPH contains only two cysteines (Cys416 and Cys453), which are located in the catalytic domain and form a disulfide bond linking helices 6 and 7. Active Site The serine proteases are known to possess a conserved Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad. The three-dimensional arrangement of Ser445, Asp524, and His556 in apAPH matches with other hydrolase structures. This triad is located in the C-terminal hydrolase domain where it is covered by the tunnel formed by the N-terminal -propeller domain. Ser445 is located on the turn between 34 and 7; Asp524 is located on the loop between 36 and 11; and His556 is located on the loop between 36 and 12.

Characteristic of / hydrolases, the active serine is located on a sharp turn known as a nucleophile elbow. The sequence surrounding the active serine is Gly-TyrSer-Tyr-Gly, which is consistent with the Gly-X-Ser-XGly consensus sequence observed in the / hydrolase folds of the lipase, esterase, and serine protease superfamily. The main chain conformation of Ser445 is strained, with (, ) (61.3 , 125.1 ). This is an energetically unfavorable conformation also observed in other / hydrolases and is believed to provide an energy reservoir for catalysis. The location of several glycine residues (Gly443, Gly447, and Gly448) in very close proximity to the catalytic Ser445 allows the avoidance of any steric hindrance in the sharp turn of the nucleophile elbow. The net result is that Ser445 is well exposed and readily accessible to both the catalytic His556 imidazole group and the substrate. The main entrance to the active site is via a tunnel in

the -propeller domain, whose diameter is approxi° mately 7 A; this is large enough for small peptides to enter but would clearly prevent larger peptides and proteins from accessing the central cavity and undergoing accidental hydrolysis. A second, smaller side opening also provides access to the active site and is located ° between blades 1 and 2. The 6 A wide opening is lined by the residues Asn65, Arg81, Asp82, Glu88, Asp553, Ala557, Ile558, Asn559, and Asn563. As with the main propeller entrance, the side entrance is also water solvated. Assuming the reaction proceeds via a general serine protease mechanism, this side opening may provide an exit for the reaction product following nucleophilic attack and formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate.

Substrate Recognition and Catalytic Mechanism Acylpeptide hydrolases are unique among the prolyl oligopeptidase family for their substrate preference, which is a short peptide blocked at the N terminus. In order to understand more about the substrate specificity of apAPH, we determined the structure of a complex with p-nitrophenyl phosphate, a small organophosphorus compound known to be a nonspecific inhibitor of esterases. As with many serine proteases, apAPH is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing both acylpeptide hydrolase and esterase activity (Y.F., unpublished data). This similarity between esterases and acylpeptide hydrolases means that they share common inhibitors (Scaloni et al., 1994). The complex structure unambiguously maps out the S1 substrate binding pocket located in close proximity to the active site (Figures 3A and 3B). The pocket provides a hydrophobic environment for the substrate and is lined by the residues Met477, Phe485, Phe488, Ile489, Leu492, Trp474, Tyr446, and Val471. Of these, only Met477 is conserved in human, porcine, and rat APH. It is surprising to note that the phosphate group of pNP is not covalently attached to the catalytic serine. Instead, in protomer B the O3P atom of the phosphate group is hydrogen bonded to the O atom of Ser445 with a dis° tance of 2.8 A (Figure 3C). The O2P atom forms a hydro° gen bond with the main chain amide of Gly369 (2.9 A), indicating the location of the oxyanion binding site. Finally, a water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the O4P ° atom (2.4 A). The phenyl ring is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with two phenylalanines, Phe485 and Phe488, as well as with Thr527. A similar orientation of the substrate is observed in the pocket of protomer A, but with the lack of the water molecule hydrogen bonded to O4P. Consequently, the hydrogen bond distance be° tween O3P and Ser445 O is reduced to 2.3 A, and the hydrogen bond distance between O2P and the Gly369 ° main chain amide is also reduced to 2.3 A. Previous studies of apAPH have indicated that the substrate recognition is not specific. Of a series of Acamino acid-pNAs tested, apAPH shows the highest activity for Ac-Phe and Ac-Leu substrates, while the lowest activity is for Ac-Ala and Ac-Lys (Y.F., unpublished data). Conversely, the human and rat forms of APH show highest activity for Ac-Ala, Ac-Met, and Ac-Ser. In addition, apAPH also has high activity for the dipeptides Ala-Phe

and Ala-Asp. It is likely that Phe485 and Phe488, which serve as anchors for the pNP substrate, influence the recognition of Phe and Leu in the P1 position. Further study of the substrate specificity using p-nitrophenyl alkanoate esters (C2-C18 acyl groups) shows that apAPH has optimal activity for substrates with an acyl chain length of C8 (Y.F., unpublished data). The S2 pocket is not mapped by the pNP substrate, but its location can be inferred through a detailed comparison with POP and DPP-IV. The putative S2 pocket is also a hydrophobic environment and is particularly rich in phenylalanines (Phe153, Phe155, Phe163, and Phe371). The S2 pocket of DPP-IV features a dual GluGlu recognition motif (Glu205-Glu206), which binds the free amino terminus of the P2 residue and is essential for enzyme activity. While apAPH does not have this Glu-Glu motif, it does have an equivalent binding site formed by Phe153 and Phe155. The S2 site is also lined by Arg526, which is structurally equivalent to Arg125 in DPP-IV and Arg643 in POP. This arginine has been confirmed in both DPP-IV and POP to stabilize and activate the P2 residue carbonyl oxygen. Arg526 is also found to be conserved in all other APH sequences. Further work is required to confirm the specific role of this residue. The oxyanion binding site is an essential feature for serine protease catalysis. The negatively charged oxyanion is generated from the carbonyl of the scissile bond and stabilized by two hydrogen bonds. In apAPH, a hydrogen bond is made by the main chain nitrogen of Gly369 to the O2P atom of the phosphate group of pNP. The second hydrogen bond is most likely provided by ° the main chain amide of Tyr446, which is located 4 A from the O2P atom of the phosphate group of pNP. This arrangement, in which one of the bonds is formed by the main chain amide group adjacent to the catalytic serine, is typical of the / hydrolase fold family. A different hydrogen bonding pattern is observed in POP, wherein the equivalent to the Gly369 main chain hydrogen bond is provided by the hydroxyl group of Tyr473 and not by the main chain amide group. However, superposition of their active sites shows that the OH group of Tyr473 in POP is in a structurally equivalent position to the amide nitrogen of Gly369 in apAPH.

Conclusions In summary, we have successfully determined the structure of an acylpeptide hydrolase from the thermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix K1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure of an acylpeptide hydrolase to be determined. The structure confirms that acylpeptide hydrolases are members of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases. The apAPH structure shares the catalytic / hydrolase domain of other serine proteases, as well as the -propeller domain found in prolyl oligopeptidase family structures for the specific recognition of small peptides. The apAPH structure also includes many features known to be important for serine protease catalysis, such as the Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad, Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly sequence motif, and oxyanion binding site. Despite the relatively low sequence similarity among acylpeptide hydrolases, the

structural features of apAPH suggest a general serine protease mechanism for protein degradation from archaea to mammals. We have also determined the structure of a complex with a small OP substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The complex structure reveals the basis for substrate recognition by apAPH and maps out the active site residues important for catalysis, including the oxyanion binding site. The design of specific inhibitors for

acylpeptide hydrolases will be important for further study of this important family of enzymes.
Experimental Procedures Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Crystallization apAPH The cloning, expression, purification, and crystallization of apAPH have been described previously (Chen et al., 2002; Wang et al.,

Crystal Structure of apAPH 1487

2003). Briefly, the purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and transferred into a buffer containing 20 mmol/l Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). For preparation of the Se-Met protein derivative, 5 mM DTT was used for antioxidation during the purification procedure. Crystallization trials were conducted at 291 K in 16-well plates using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The best crystals were obtained from reservoir of 6% PEG4000, 50 mM/l NaAC (pH 4.6), 15 mM/l DTT, 0.2 mM/l EDTA. pNP inhibitor complex apAPH crystals were soaked with 20 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate dissolved in the buffer containing 6% PEG 4000, 25 mM NaAC (pH 4.6). A 5 l aliquot of such solution was added to the drop, and the crystals were soaked overnight. All of the crystals were cryoprotected in 30% glycerol prior to freezing in a cryostream. Data Collection ° Three data sets were collected at peak ( 0.9795 A), edge ( ° ° 0.9798 A), and remote ( 0.9800 A) wavelengths from a single selenomethionyl derivative crystal on beamline BL14XU of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). Data were processed and scaled using HKL 2000 ° (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) to a maximum resolution of 2.1 A. Data from a single crystal of apAPH in complex with p-nitrophenyl phosphate were collected in-house on a Rigaku RAXIS-IV detec° tor at wavelength 1.5418 A and 100 K. All data were processed with ° MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992) to 2.7 A resolution, and scaled and merged with SCALA (Evans, 1997). Structure Determination and Refinement ° The structure of apAPH was determined to 2.1 A resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method. CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) was used to locate 20 selenium atoms and ° calculate initial phases to 3.0 A. The initial phases and heavy-atom sites were then input into RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2000) for phase extension and density modification. Noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) consistent with point group (rotation) symmetry was found among 18 of the 20 heavy-atom sites, and NCS averaging was consequently used by RESOLVE to improve the quality of the electron density map. A total of 980 residues were traced automatically in two molecules, and the remainder of the structure was built into the experimental electron density map using O (Jones et al., 1991) and ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999). Refinement of the model was performed using CNS with alternate cycles of manual rebuilding in O. NCS restraints were applied in the early stages of refinement and were released in later stages. The current model has working and free R factors of 19.3% and 23.0%, respectively. The model has good stereochemistry, with 90.1% of residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot generated by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and none in disallowed regions. ° The structure of the apAPH-pNP complex was refined to 2.7 A resolution using the native wild-type structure as a starting point. Manual adjustments were made to the model in O, and refinement |Fc| difference map, a was performed in CNS. From an |Fo| p-nitrophenyl phosphate inhibitor molecule was located near the active site of each subunit. The current model has working and free R factors of 20.8% and 26.9%, respectively. Stereochemistry of the structure is good, with 85.0% of residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot generated by PROCHECK.
