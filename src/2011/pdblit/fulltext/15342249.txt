Structural Insights into the Conformational Variability of FtsZ
María A. Oliva, Daniel Trambaiolo and Jan Löwe
MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK Received 18 July 2007; received in revised form 22 August 2007; accepted 23 August 2007 Available online 29 August 2007 FtsZ is a prokaryotic homologue of the eukaryotic cytoskeletal protein tubulin and plays a central role in prokaryotic cell division. Both FtsZ and tubulin are known to pass through cycles of polymerization and depolymerization, but the structural mechanisms underlying this cycle remain to be determined. Comparison of tubulin structures obtained in different states has led to a model in which the tubulin monomer undergoes a conformational switch between a "straight" form found in the walls of microtubules and a "curved" form associated with depolymerization, and it was proposed recently that this model may apply also to FtsZ. Here, we present new structures of FtsZ from47 Aquifex aeolicus,47 Bacillus subtilis, Methanococcus jannaschii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that provide strong constraints on any proposed role for a conformational switch in the FtsZ monomer. By comparing the full range of FtsZ structures determined in different crystal forms and nucleotide states, and in the presence or in the absence of regulatory proteins, we find no evidence of a conformational change involving domain movement. Our new structural data make it clear that the previously proposed straight and curved conformations of FtsZ were related to inter-species differences in domain orientation rather than two interconvertible conformations. We propose a new model in which lateral interactions help determine the curvature of protofilaments.

Introduction
FtsZ, a highly conserved cytoskeletal protein involved in bacterial cell division, is the first protein known to localize to the division site, where it polymerizes to form a dynamic ring structure known as the Z ring.1,2 The polymerization dynamics of FtsZ depend on its properties as a GTPase: nucleotide binding promotes longitudinal association of monomers into protofilaments, while hydrolysis leads to protofilament disassembly.3­5 Despite extensive investigations into FtsZ behaviour both in vivo and in vitro, its precise role and mechanism in cell division remain unclear.6­9 Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to its role in septum formation, FtsZ may have a role in cell wall elongation.10­12 The monomer and protofilament structures of FtsZ are similar to those of its eukaryotic homologue

tubulin,13­15 and improved understanding of the mechanisms of each of these proteins may yield insights that are relevant to the other. Tubulin heterodimers assemble into microtubules, which are long hollow cylinders composed of laterally associated straight protofilaments. The GTPase activity of -tubulin is activated in the polymer, and the dynamic instability of microtubules arises from the fact that the thermodynamically unstable GDPbound protofilaments are held in a metastable polymerized state by lateral interactions and the presence of a GTP-bound cap. Loss of the GTP cap leads to rapid depolymerization of the microtubule. Dynamic instability requires that GDP in the polymer cannot exchange with GTP. The mechanics of depolymerization are thought to play a role in generating the force for sister chromatid separation during mitosis.16­18 FtsZ monomers form protofilaments that are similar to those of tubulin; although lateral association of FtsZ protofilaments has been observed in vitro, the molecular details and physiological relevance of this bundling are unclear.19,20 FtsZ protofilaments can

1230 be straight or curved, and other morphologies including sheets, tubes, minirings and helices have been observed in vitro, depending on the experimental conditions used.21,22 In contrast to tubulin, FtsZ filaments are thought not to display dynamic instability, and biochemical experiments suggest that FtsZ polymers undergo rapid exchange of either nucleotide or monomers, either of which would be incompatible with dynamic instability.23,24 It is not known whether the Z ring has a direct mechanical role in cell division or merely serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of other cell division proteins. FtsZ and tubulin share a distinctive fold with a two-domain architecture: an N-terminal nucleotidebinding domain is connected via a central helix (H7) to a C-terminal domain that is involved in forming the protofilament.13,14 The GTPase active site is formed at the interface between monomers by insertion of acidic residues from the C-terminal domain's T7 (synergy) loop into the nucleotidebinding pocket of the preceding monomer in the protofilament. In the case of FtsZ, the unit of polymerization is the monomer, while in the case of tubulin it is the -tubulin heterodimer. Tubulin and -tubulin each bind one nucleotide molecule. -Tubulin remains GTP-bound and associated stably with -tubulin because the T7 loop of -tubulin lacks the acidic residue that would be needed to complete the -tubulin active site.14 Structures of tubulin in different states reveal the existence of distinct conformations of the tubulin monomer: a "straight" conformation found in the straight protofilaments of microtubules and flat Zninduced sheets,14,25 and a "curved" conformation seen in co-crystals of -tubulin with colchicine and the RB3 stathmin-like domain,26 and in helical ribbons. 27 -Tubulin 28 and BtubA/B 29 have a conformation similar to the curved conformation of -tubulin. The conformational switch involves a change in the packing angle between the tubulin Nterminal and C-terminal domains (8° in -tubulin and 11° in -tubulin) coupled with a shift in the position of the central helix H7 (1.5 Å in -tubulin and 2.5 Å in -tubulin). Somewhat surprisingly, both the  and -tubulin subunits of the tubulin heterodimer seem to undergo this switch in a concerted fashion, despite the fact that only tubulin alters its nucleotide state. This observation suggests that the tubulin conformational switch, unlike the classical conformational switches seen in small GTPases,30­33 is dependent on the longitudinal and lateral interactions between monomers rather than on nucleotide content alone. It has been proposed that the conformational switch plays a role in force generation by depolymerizing microtubules, perhaps acting as a power stroke as the protofilament curls outwards from the microtubule wall.34,35 Does FtsZ undergo a conformational switch similar to that proposed for tubulin? We have determined the structure of Methanococcus jannaschii FtsZ (MjFtsZ) in different nucleotide states and

found no evidence of significant conformational changes, despite the fact that the crystal packing in one crystal form creates interfaces between monomers similar to those found in the protofilament.36 However, a recent comprehensive analysis of all available FtsZ structures found that the conformation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa FtsZ (PaFtsZ) bound to the inhibitory protein SulA differed from the conformations of free FtsZ protein from other species in a manner that resembled the tubulin straight­curved conformational switch.37 Here, we present the structures of FtsZ from Bacillus subtilis (BsFtsZ) and Aquifex aeolicus (AaFtsZ), as well as the structure of free FtsZ from P. aeruginosa and a new high-resolution structure of Methanococcus jannaschii FtsZ (MjFtsZ), and analyse the implications of these new structures for our understanding of FtsZ conformational mechanics. The structure of B. subtilis FtsZ shows no unusual feature, but we find that crystals of A. aeolicus FtsZ contain an alternative mode of packing at the protofilament interface, suggesting the degree of flexibility that this interface might be able to accommodate. Comparison of the structures of SulA-bound and free P. aeruginosa FtsZ reveals no significant conformational change, and we conclude that the differences between P. aeruginosa and M. jannaschii FtsZ are due simply to their different primary sequences rather than the presence of a conformational switch that depends on the nucleotide state of the monomeric protein. A comprehensive structural analysis of all available structures reveals the intrinsic variability of the relative positioning of FtsZ between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains in different species. Finally, we present a model for the FtsZ polymerization cycle, taking into account the lack of a nucleotide-dependent conformational change in the monomer.

Results and Discussion
Structure of FtsZ from B. subtilis We have solved the structure of untagged, fulllength B. subtilis FtsZ at a resolution of 2.5 Å (Figure 1(a)). Although the crystals grew only in the presence of FtsZ inhibitor dichamanetin,38 we were unable to locate the inhibitor in the final electron density maps. The overall structure of BsFtsZ is similar to previously solved FtsZ structures. No electron density was visible for the N-terminal residues 1­12 or the C-terminal residues 316­382. The structure shows BsFtsZ in its empty form: nucleotide content analysis of the protein used for crystallization yielded a GXP: FtsZ ratio of 0.07, and the crystallographic electron density maps show that the nucleotide-binding pocket is empty apart from a bound sulfate ion. It is worth highlighting that the nucleotide-binding pocket is blocked by helix H2 and loop T3 of the next molecule in the crystal lattice, which precludes dichamanetin or nucleotide soaking experiments.

1233 by soaking. However, we have recently managed to obtain co-crystals of AaFtsZ with the inhibitor 8-morpholino-GTP, again at very high resolution (1.4 Å, in collaboration with Tanneke den Blaauwen, Amsterdam, unpublished results). Despite the additional presence of the nucleotide -phosphate group and a bound magnesium ion, these crystals are essentially identical with the GDP-bound crystals that we describe here. The lack of a conformational change in AaFtsZ induced by the presence of the -phosphate group reinforces the previously reported observation that monomeric FtsZ shows no structural change between its empty, GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms.36 The movement of the catalytic aspartic acid residues away from the active site is not entirely surprising if the crystal packing mimics the posthydrolysis state of the protofilament. The docking interface between adjacent monomers in true protofilaments may permit greater flexibility than is commonly assumed. Similar flexibility in the protofilament interface can be seen by comparing the different -tubulin structures determined by electron crystallography of Zn-induced sheets,14,35 electron microscopic reconstruction of helical tubes formed in the presence of GDP or GMPPCP,40 and X-ray crystallography of -tubulin in complex with the RB3 stathmin-like domain and colchicines.26 These changes in docking between tubulin monomers contribute substantially to the curvature of tubulin protofilaments in their curved state, in addition to some flexibility within the subunits, and it is likely that the same is true of FtsZ. Structure of SulA-free FtsZ from P. aeruginosa PaFtsZ was crystallized in the absence of SulA using the previously described C-terminally truncated construct lacking 76 residues. 41 Crystals containing a single molecule per asymmetric unit diffracted to a resolution of 2.9 Å, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement (Figure 1(a)). Nucleotide content of the purified protein showed a GXP/FtsZ ratio of 0.35 after gel filtration, and electron density maps indicated the presence of GDP in the nucleotide-binding pocket. Magnesium was not present in the crystallization conditions, and no magnesium ion was visible in the electron density maps. Superposition of FtsZ structures and determination of domain angles We aligned all previously available and new FtsZ structures (Table 1) using 56 residues from the core secondary structural elements of the highly conserved N-terminal domain (Table 2). The domainswapped dimer of Thermotoga maritima FtsZ (TmFtsZ) and one chain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsZ (MtFtsZ) were excluded from the analysis, since these structures contain distortions due to the changes in loop T7 (TmFtsZ) or crystal contacts (MtFtsZ) that are unlikely to be physiologically

High-resolution structure of FtsZ from M. jannaschii We have solved MjFtsZ in a new crystal form that yielded diffraction data to 1.7 Å resolution. The electron density maps revealed the presence of GDP in the nucleotide-binding pocket, without a magnesium ion. Helix H0 is in a different position when compared with PDB ID 1FSZ. After aligning the N-terminal domains, the key residues in the C-terminal domains (Table 2) show an rmsd of 1.2 Å. This difference between two structures in the same nucleotide state but in different crystal contexts gives an indication of the inherent flexibility of the FtsZ monomer. Structure of FtsZ from A. aeolicus FtsZ from Aquifex aeolicus was crystallized as a C-terminally truncated construct lacking residues 331­367, since full-length protein produced only poor-quality crystals and primary sequence analysis suggested that these residues were likely to be unstructured. The AaFtsZ crystals diffracted to a resolution of 1.7 Å (Figure 1(a)). The crystals contain one molecule of AaFtsZ per asymmetric unit, and electron density is clearly defined for residues 8­326 and bound GDP. The packing of the AaFtsZ molecules in the crystal is somewhat similar to the arrangement thought to occur in the protofilament (Figure 1(b)). We suggested earlier that the best high-resolution model for the FtsZ protofilament is found in crystals of the GTP/Mg2+ -soaked form of MjFtsZ (PDB ID 1W5A): one dimer seen in these crystals is closely similar to the -tubulin dimer, and the two aspartic acid residues in the T7 loop, which are known to form part of the protofilament's active site, are positioned to activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the -phosphate group.36 The new AaFtsZ crystals contain an interface between the monomers that is similar to the interface seen in the MjFtsZ dimer, although the contact area is less extensive. The repeat distance between AaFtsZ monomers is 44 Å, slightly longer than the 43 Å spacing seen in the crystallographic dimer of MjFtsZ and the 42­ 43 Å distance of EcFtsZ and MjFtsZ sheets measured by electron microscopy.20,39 The adjacent monomers are positioned such that Asp206 and Asp209 of the synergy loop involved in catalysis are shifted away from the active site. Asp206 forms a salt-bridge with Lys139, whose positive charge is widely conserved in FtsZ from different species. The differences between the pseudo-protofilament interfaces in MjFtsZ and AaFtsZ crystals may be related, in part, to the nucleotide state. It is possible to soak GTP into the MjFtsZ crystals and the structure that results appears to be poised in preparation for catalysis: the crystal packing was thus interpreted as representing the GTP-bound form of the protofilament. The AaFtsZ crystals were grown in the presence of GDP and contain GDP in the active site, and it was not possible to obtain a GTP-bound form

relevant. When performing pairwise alignments of structures it is possible to introduce bias towards the reference structure. Therefore, we first carried out the alignment using PaFtsZ as a reference and then generated averaged C positions of the 56 key residues from all the aligned structures (Figure 2; Table 2). Finally, the averaged C positions were used as the reference for alignment of all structures. Having aligned the FtsZ structures in this way, it is possible to detect subtle shifts in the relative positions of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains that would not be evident if the structures were aligned over the entire molecule. Lack of conformational change between free and SulA-bound P. aeruginosa FtsZ The previously determined structure of PaFtsZ in complex with SulA shows a SulA dimer bound to two FtsZ molecules.41 SulA binds to and occludes the T7 loop surface of the FtsZ monomer, blocking the protofilament interface and preventing polymerization.42 However, a recent analysis by Buey et al. found that superposition of MjFtsZ and PaFtsZ structures reveals a displacement of the H7 helix coupled with a movement of the C-terminal domain. Since this difference is reminiscent of the conformational changes thought to occur in the curved-to-straight conformational switch of tubulin, the authors concluded that MjFtsZ crystals show the monomer in its curved state while the PaFtsZ-SulA complex shows the monomer its a straight state. They further proposed that SulA binding, in addition to blocking the protofilament interface, might induce a conformational change that mimics the conformation of FtsZ in straight protofilaments. However, these conclusions remained tentative in the absence of structural data on SulA-free PaFtsZ. A comparison of our new structure of SulA-free PaFtsZ with the previously published PaFtsZ-SulA complex shows no significant difference between the two (Figure 3), despite the different crystal contexts. Any change seen between the two structures is much smaller than those seen between FtsZ structures from different organisms (see below; Figure 4; Tables 3 and 4). Comparison of the structure of SulA-free PaFtsZ with the two PaFtsZ molecules in the asymmetric unit of the SulA-bound crystals shows that the differences between the SulA-free and SulA-bound structures are not greater than the differences between the two SulA-bound structures. The superposition of SulA-free FtsZ with SulA-bound molecule A shows that differences with chain A involve only small displacements of S2, loop T3, loop T7 (in the N-terminal domain), S9, S10 and loops in the protein surface (in the C-terminal domain) with an rmsd of 0.5 Å. Within molecule B, shifts are localized in H1, H2, loop H2-S3, H5, H6, H7 top, loop T7 (in the N-terminal domain), S9, S10 and loops on the protein surface (in the C-terminal domain) with a slightly bigger rmsd of 0.9 Å.

Figure 3. Ribbon representation of P. aeruginosa structure superposition in (a) side view and (b) top view. FtsZ in complex with the cell division inhibitor SulA is in dark-red (PDB ID 1OFU) and FtsZ without SulA (PDB ID 2VAW) is in blue. Both molecules have GDP in the nucleotide-binding pocket, shown in space-filling representation. FtsZ without SulA shows a 2.59° downward movement of the C-terminal domain. The lack of significant changes when comparing the free and SulA-bound form of FtsZ excludes a conformational change as proposed.37

SulA-bound structures are 2.59° (with chain A) and 2.09° (with chain B). Comparing the two molecules from the SulA-bound crystals, the largest changes involve H6, the top of H7 (in the N-terminal domain) and H9, H10, loop H9-S8 and loop S9H10 (in the C-terminal domain) with an rmsd of 0.8 Å. It appears that SulA inhibits FtsZ polymerisation simply by blocking the protofilament interface and preventing longitudinal association, rather than by inducing any substantial conformational change. Absence of a nucleotide-dependent conformational change It has been proposed that tubulin undergoes a nucleotide-dependent conformational change, and that this causes changes in the resulting polymer structures.34 For FtsZ, we previously favoured a model that does not invoke such changes because no significant difference was observed between the crystal structures of MjFtsZ in the GDP and GTP states (PDB ID 1FSZ and 1W5E).36 Analogous findings were reported in the case of -tubulin.28 Here, we use the improved structural alignment of all available structures of MjFtsZ in different nucleotide states (Table 3). GDP-bound (PDB ID 1FSZ) and GTP-bound mutant MjFtsZ (W319Y, PDB ID 1W5E) show an rmsd between their C-terminal domains of 1.0 Å and we consider this difference insignificant, taking the resolutions of the structures into account. Similarly, our new pair of AaFtsZ:GDP and AaFtsZ:8-morpholino-GTP show even smaller differences (rmsd 0.2 Å). We therefore conclude that there is no change of the inter-domain angle in the monomer caused by changes in the nucleotide state. A slightly larger difference is seen between the GDP-bound state of the monomer of MjFtsZ (PDB ID

1FSZ) and the nucleotide-free form in the pseudoprotofilaments (PDB ID 1W59) involving an rmsd of 1.45 Å (Figure 4(a)), which implies a slight upward movement of the C-terminal domain, coupled with a sideways displacement of the top of helix H7. The differences between these two structures could be due to the nucleotide content or to the protofilamentlike crystal packing, or both. Since the two different crystal forms of MjFtsZ-GDP have an rmsd for the C-terminal domain of 1.2 Å, we would consider that the differences shown in Figure 4(a) represent only the inherent flexibility of the FtsZ monomer rather than a nucleotide-dependent change. Soaking experiments with different nucleotides also revealed no conformational change on FtsZ, as expected, since the crystal lattice imposes strong constraints. For example, a GMPCPP soak of previously GDP-containing MjFtsZ crystals shows an rmsd of only 0.4 Å (PDB IDs 1W58, 1FSZ). Domain arrangements in other FtsZs A comprehensive analysis of the superimposed structures of FtsZ from different organisms and in different states reveals that the most striking pairwise differences are seen in the comparisons between PaFtsZ and MjFtsZ, with a C rmsd of 2.67 Å calculated over the C-terminal domain (larger than the 1.84 Å rmsd reported for the previous analysis,37 as these used a slightly different set of residues to align the N-terminal domain), PaFtsZ and BsFtsZ with a C rmsd of 2.46 Å, and AaFtsZ and BsFtsZ with an rmsd of 1.90 Å (Table 3; Figure 4(b)). These deviations are induced by a general downward movement of the PaFtsZ C-terminal domain followed by a sideways displacement of the top of H7 helix (Figure 4(a)). The rotation angle of the C-terminal domain shows the same trend as the C

After aligning the nucleotide-binding domains, the C-terminal domains show upward movements from 1.46 Å to 2.39 Å. The same trend is reflected when calculating single rotation angles that vary between 5.88° to 8.02° between different FtsZ molecules. (c) GDPbound PaFtsZ, MjFtsZ, AaFtsZ and MtFtsZ superposition showing the nucleotide-binding pocket. The guanine base of GDP points at a conserved Asp residue in helix H7 (Asp187, Asp212, Asp179 and Asp184, respectively). No large change can be seen, but the position of the base moves slightly due to the different position of H7 and the aspartic acid residues.

1239 (Figure 4(c)), where the guanosine forms a hydrogen bond with a conserved Asp residue in helix H7, and differences in the position of this helix relative to the N-terminal domain lead to slightly different orientations of the nucleotide. PaFtsZ and MjFtsZ show the biggest differences in C-terminal domain position, while BsFtsZ, MtFtsZ and AaFtsZ display an intermediate position between the two extremes. BsFtsZ is closer to MjFtsZ with an rmsd of 1.63 Å. AaFtsZ and MtFtsZ have a Cterminal domain position roughly intermediate between PaFtsZ and MjFtsZ, with rmsd values of 1.51 Å and 1.64 Å (AaFtsZ), and 1.7 Å and 1.63 Å (MtFtsZ). These rmsd values are an average of all those from FtsZ structures of a single organism when it is applicable (Table 3). This comparison shows clear evidence of structural differences among FtsZ homologues from different organisms. These differences do not appear to correlate with phylogenetic groupings, crystallization conditions or truncations of the construct used for crystallization, and probably represent no more than the natural differences between structures that would be expected on the basis of their different primary sequences. Sequence alignments of these FtsZ homologues shows an identity of 33­54%, of which most similarity is located in the N-terminal domain. Lattice versus strain model

After aligning against the averaged reference, angles were calculated relative to PaFtsZ (PDB ID 2VAW).

rmsd measurements (Table 4): the biggest difference in angle is observed between PaFtsZ and MjFtsZ (8.02°); the rotation angles of the PaFtsZ C-terminal domain relative to BsFtsZ, AaFtsZ and MtFtsZ are 7.6°, 7.4° and 5.8°, respectively. The differences in the position of helix H7 relative to the N-terminal domain can be seen clearly by examining the position of the nucleotide in the different structures

The structural data and analysis presented here suggest a revised model of the straight-to-curved transition in the protofilament (Figure 5). Although it is possible that future structural data on FtsZ may reveal a nucleotide-induced conformational change in the monomer, we consider this highly unlikely, given the fact that we have analysed a large number of structures from several different species, in

Figure 5. The Lattice versus Strain model. The central idea is that lateral interactions can stabilise a strained conformation of the protofilament. The monomer shows no change in conformation related to the nucleotide state. Single protofilaments may prefer to adopt straight or curved conformations, depending on the nucleotide state. Increasing or decreasing the curvature introduces some degree of strain, which may result in distortion of the protofilament interface or the monomer conformation. In higher-order structures formed by lateral association of single protofilaments, the strain of curvature can be offset by the energy of the lateral interactions.

1240 different nucleotide states (GTP, GDP and empty), and in the presence and in the absence of bound inhibitory proteins, and found no evidence of such a conformational change. In the tubulin field, this relates to similar data obtained with -tubulin.28 Central to our proposal is the observation that FtsZ monomers (and probably tubulin as well) and the protofilament interfaces have a flexibility that allows the molecules to balance different sources and sinks of energy in the system. Starting with the GDP form of the monomer, the immediate effect of GDP to GTP exchange is to promote longitudinal association of monomers into protofilaments; no conformational change in the monomer takes place at this stage. Once formed, the protofilaments will have some flexibility and can adopt different curvatures by bending at the interfaces between subunits and perhaps within the subunits themselves.26,43 In higher-order structures formed by lateral association of single protofilaments, the strain of curvature can be offset by the energy of the lateral interactions. The currently accepted view of protofilament structure is that the GDP-bound form of the protofilament is intrinsically curved, while the GTP-bound form is straight. However, the majority of experimental data on filaments of both FtsZ and tubulin have been obtained in the presence of interactions that may alter the filament curvature: crystal packing, bundling of filaments or adsorption onto electron microscope grids. We believe that current proposals for the structure of the single protofilament remain speculative. High-resolution structural information is missing for two crucial states of our model. For FtsZ, there is currently no structural model of the protofilament in a state that has appropriate lateral interactions. An experimentally determined structure of FtsZ in laterally associated filaments could reveal details of changes at the protofilament interface and perhaps also within the monomer. These changes might include a shift in the angle between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains similar to that observed for tubulin. Similarly, we expect that a high-resolution structure of -tubulin in the absence of lateral interactions would reveal the free conformation of the tubulin dimer. This would allow us to decide whether the tubulin dimer is intrinsically curved in the absence of additional sources of energy (stathmin binding or lateral interactions) and whether this conformation indeed involves changes in the angle between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Unfortunately, the structures of FtsZ in straight protofilaments and free tubulin are not available.

Conformational Variability of FtsZ After precipitation in 30% ammonium sulfate saturation and anion-exchange chromatography, the protein was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol and subjected to gelfiltration chromatography in the same buffer using a Sephacryl S200 26/60 column (Amersham). The purest fractions were concentrated to 10 g/l and used directly for crystallization. The nucleotide content was measured as described.20 Untagged, full-length ftsZ from B. subtilis (ATCC 23857D) was cloned into NdeI and BamHI of pHis17. Sequencing of multiple independent clones revealed three modifications relative to the published database sequence: cgc to cgt (a silent mutation in the codon for R332), gac to gag (D350E) and gca to cca (A351P). These changes were assumed to be due to strain differences or errors in the database sequence. The protein was purified by precipitation in 30% ammonium sulfate in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, followed by anion-exchange chromatography with a 5 ml HiTrap Q HP column (Amersham) in 50 mM Mes­KOH (pH 6.5), 5 mM MgCl2 where FtsZ was eluted with 300 mM KCl. Finally the protein was subjected to gel-filtration chromatography (Sephacryl S300 26/60 column, Amersham) in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaN3, concentrated to 15 g/l and stored at -80 °C. C-terminally truncated A. aeolicus FtsZ (residues 1­330) was cloned into NdeI and HindIII of pHis17, yielding a C-terminally His6-tagged fusion protein. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen). Exponential growth phase cells (A600 = 0.7) were induced for 4 h by the addition of 0.3% (w/v, final concentration) arabinose. The protein was purified by HisTrap nickelaffinity chromatography followed by gel-filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S200 column in 20 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM NaN3. Fractions containing highly pure FtsZ were concentrated to 15 g/l and stored at -80 °C. Crystallization and structure determination All crystals were grown at 19 °C using the sitting-drop. vapour-diffusion technique and initial hits were found using our in-house nanolitre crystallization facility.45 Diffraction data was collected at the ESRF (Grenoble, France). Data were integrated and reduced using MOSFLM and SCALA.46 Structure solution and refinement were performed using CNS47 or REFMAC.48 MjFtsZ (PDB ID 2VAP) crystals were grown over a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Bis-Tris propane (pH 7.0) and 4.0 M ammonium acetate. Drops were composed of 100 nl of protein at 10.0 g/l (with 8 mM MgCl2, 8 mM NaF, 200 M AlCl3, 1 mM GDP) and 100 nl of reservoir solution (AlF3 was not visible in the electron density). Crystals were cryoprotected with 25% (v/v) glycerol. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with 1FSZ as the model. PaFtsZ crystals were grown over a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.8), 26% (w/v) PEG2000MME. Drops were composed of 200 nl of protein (10.0 g/l) and 200 nl of reservoir solution. The cryobuffer was crystallization solution plus 15% (w/v) PEG200. Molecular replacement was carried out using the PaFtsZ monomer from PDB ID 1OFU as the search model. BsFtsZ crystals were grown over a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Mes­NaOH (pH 6.0), 0.24 M (NH4)2SO4, 11% (w/v) PEG8000 and drops were composed of 500 nl of protein solution (containing 0.5 mM protein and 3 mM dichamanetin from a 100 mM stock solution in DMSO) plus 500 nl of reservoir.

Conformational Variability of FtsZ activity of FtsZ,38 and was obtained from the authors. Before flash-cooling, the crystals were placed in mother liquor plus 15% glycerol. Molecular replacement was carried out using the PaFtsZ monomer as a search model (PDB ID 1OFU). AaFtsZ crystals were grown by adding 2 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM GDP (final concentrations) to the protein sample (15 g/l) and crystallizing over a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Mops­NaOH (pH 6.5), 0.2 M NaCl, 28% (w/v) PEG400. Drops were composed of 500 nl of protein solution and 500 nl of reservoir solution. No additional cryoprotectant was added to the crystals before flash freezing. Diffraction data were collected to 1.7 Å on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode. Molecular replacement was performed with MjFtsZ (PDB ID 1FSZ) as the search model. Alignment of FtsZ structures To select the core secondary structure residues of the Nterminal domain, we performed an initial multiple structural alignment of FtsZ homologues from P. aeruginosa, A. aeolicus, B. subtilis, M. tuberculosis, M. jannaschii and T. maritima FtsZ using the MSDFold web server.49 We selected 56 core residues that are located within secondary structure elements of the N-terminal domain of FtsZ, choosing the residues that were less than 2 Å apart in the alignment and were located in the interior of the protein, thus excluding regions of the structure that might be distorted by crystal contacts (see Figure 2, grey arrows). All structures were aligned on the basis of these core residues against PaFtsZ (PDB ID 1OFU) and superimposed. We then calculated the average C coordinates for the 56 residues of the N-terminal domain core (one structure per organism only) and used these as a new reference PDB file for all structures, including PaFtsZ in a second round of alignment. The rmsd values of the C-terminal domains after aligning the N-terminal domains were calculated using 11 selected residues located on core secondary structural elements of that domain (see Figure 2, black arrows). Rotation angles were calculated using the same residues.
