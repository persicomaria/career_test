SUMMARY: Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKl) from Thermus fhermophilus differs from other bacterial PFKs in that it is regulated by effector-induced reversible tetramer-dimer conversion rather than conformational change alone. We have cloned its gene and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with that of other PFKs. While almost all amino acid residues involved in substrate binding sites, which are assigned from crystal structures of other PFKs, are well conserved, 0 1991 Academic some possibly important changes are found at subunit interfaces. PESS, Inc.

Thermus thermophilus is a gram-negative eubacterium which can grow aerobically up to 85°C (1). This bacterium has two kinds of phosphofructokinases (ATP: is fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase). Phosphofructokinase 1 ( Tt-PFKl) of glucose in a culture medium and obeys simple Michaelis-Menten Although reversible

an allosteric enzyme (2). Phosphofructokinase 2 is produced only in the presence kinetics (3). dissociation induced by the allosteric effecters has been reversible dissociation by its allosteric effecters,

commonly observed for mammalian PFKs, Tt-PFKl is the only prokaryotic PFK so far known to undergo phosphoenolpyruvate two-subunit antagonistic (PEP) and ADPsMg. PEP, an allosteric inhibitor, induces the an allosteric activator, has an

dissociation of Tt-PFKl from active four-subunit enzyme (36,000 x 4) into inactive enzyme (36,000 x 2) and ADP.Mg, effector opposite effect to PEP. One of substrates, fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), is also an to PEP (4). PFKs from Escherichia co/i and Bacillus

Cloning of PFKI Gene ---- A polymerase chain reaction was carried out to prepare a DNA fragment for screening a genomic DNA library of Thermus thermophilus strain HB8. The 5' primer (ATGAACGC(C/G)GCCATCCG) was synthesized according to a peptide sequence at amino terminal region, MNAAIR, which was determined by Edman degradation (3), and the 3' primer (GAACCGTCGCCGCCGAT) was according to the amino acid sequence, IGGDGS, in a conserved region found in PFKs from Exoli and Bstearothermophilus (10). The distance between the two primers was predicted to be around 88 amino acids. Approximately 0.5pg of template Tfhermophilus genomic DNA and 100pM of both primers were used in one reaction (95C, 10 min; 56°C 2 min; 72%, 1.5 min; 35 cycles). The amplified 260 base pair DNA fragment was purified, cloned into pUC118, and confirmed by sequencing. Radioactive 260bp fragment was prepared using Klenow fragment and [c@*P]dCTP Tfhermophilus genomic DNA was digested by various restriction enzymes, Hindlll, Sphl, Pstl, Accl, Hirrcll, BarnHI, Smal, Kpnl and Sacl, and southern hybridization was carried out. Kpnl digestion gave a 12kb positive band and was chosen to construct a DNA library. The 12kb Kpnl fragments were enriched with agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into pUC118. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into competent E.coli JM109 and were screened with the labeled probe. Positive colonies were selected and their plasmids were confirmed to have predicted restriction patterns. Subcloning and Sequencing ---- The cloned 12kb fragment was digested by Accl and a 1.8kb Accl fragment, which hybridized with the probe, was recloned. This recloned fragment turned out to contain whole coding region of PFKl. Both strands in opposite directions were sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chaintermination method using radioactivity or fluorescence (Applied Biosystems 370A). Subclones for sequencing were prepared using exonuclease deletion method. 7deaza dGTP was used in place of dGTP. Single strand DNA was prepared by infecting transformed E.coliMV1184 cells by helper-phage M13K07. Results Sequence which of PFKf and Discussion Tr-PFKl contains 969 bases agrees from

Ttthermophilus 16s rRNA UCACCUCCUUU (11) and should be a Shine-Dalgalno sequence. At the downstream of the gene from 5th to 28th apart from the TGA stop codon, a terminator-like palindrome sequence was found. It consists of an 8 base pair stem with an 8 nucleotide loop structure. At the upstream, neither an obvious promoter-like sequence nor an appropriate reading frame were found. Homology to Other PFKs ---- The amino acid sequence of Tt-PFKl deduced

from the DNA sequence was compared with those of E.co/i PFK (EC-PFK) (8) and Bstearothermophilus PFK (Bs-PFK) (10) (Fig.2). It was also compared with the N-

except Ser-73, Leu-77, Thr-105 and Arg-107 (numbering is based on Bs-PFK sequence). The change at position 105 from Ser to Thr is a conservative one. The remaining three residues are not conserved even between Bs-PFK and EC-PFK, indicating that they are substitutable without hampering the function. Effector binding site (tight subunit interface) ---- Studies of crystal structures loose

of EC-PFK and Bs-PFK have revealed that F6P binds at the relatively

interface between subunits and that allosteric effectors, ADPMg and PEP, compete for the same binding site at the relatively tight subunit interface. It has been also reported that a critical structural reorganization takes place upon allosteric

transition at the 6-F loop (around residues 155-162) and the 8-H loop (around 2111317
