Gurmarin is a 35-residue polypeptide from the Asclepiad vine Gymnema sylvestre. It has been utilised as a pharmacological tool in the study of sweet-taste transduction because of its ability to selectively inhibit the neural response to sweet tastants in rats. We have chemically synthesised and folded gurmarin and determined its threedimensional solution structure to high resolution using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Structure calculations utilised 612 interproton-distance, 19 dihedral-angle, and 18 hydrogen-bond restraints. The structure Ê is well defined for residues 3±34, with backbone and heavy atom rms differences of 0.27 ^ 0.09 A and Ê 0.73 ^ 0.09 A, respectively. Gurmarin adopts a compact structure containing an antiparallel b-hairpin (residues 22±34), several well-defined b-turns, and a cystine-knot motif commonly observed in toxic and inhibitory polypeptides. Despite striking structural homology with d-atracotoxin, a spider neurotoxin known to slow the inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels, we show that gurmarin has no effect on a variety of voltage-sensitive channels. Keywords: gurmarin; ion channels; NMR; protein structure; sweet-taste suppression.

Gurmarin is a 35-residue polypeptide (Fig. 1) from the leaves of the Asclepiad vine Gymnema sylvestre [1,2]. G. sylvestre has long been used in Ayurevedic medicine as a treatment for diabetes mellitus, a function attributed to `gymnemic acid', a group of triterpine glycosides that inhibit sweet taste in humans [3]. Gurmarin suppresses the response of the rat chorda tympani nerve to sweet-taste stimuli such as glucose, sucrose, glycine and saccharine without affecting responses to other taste stimuli including NaCl (salty), HCl (sour) and quinine (bitter). It has no apparent effect in humans [2]. It has been suggested that the taste-suppressing effects of gurmarin might be due to the peptide either binding directly to a sweet-taste receptor [2] or interacting with a downstream target in the sweet-tastetransduction pathway. We recently showed [4] that the backbone fold of gurmarin [5] is very similar to that of d-atracotoxin (d-ACTX), a spider neurotoxin that slows the inactivation of insect and mammalian voltage-gated Na+ channels. This raised the possibility that gurmarin might suppress sweet taste by antagonising a downstream ion channel involved in sweet-taste transduction. Unfortunately, the previously determined structure [5] was of low resolution and did not afford a detailed comparison of the d-ACTX and gurmarin structures, especially with respect to the side chains. Here we present a high-resolution solution structure of gurmarin which we consider necessary for understanding its mechanism of action at the molecular level and for

facilitating comparison with other peptides of similar structure and/or function. The high-resolution structure of gurmarin shows that it is remarkably similar to d-ACTX; there is excellent overlap of conserved side chains, including several of those previously postulated to be important for the binding of d-ACTX to neuronal voltage-gated Na+ channels [4]. However, despite this structural similarity, we show that gurmarin does not interact with a variety of voltage-sensitive ion channels.

Synthesis, folding and purification Gurmarin was synthesised manually using t-Boc-protected solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques on a 0.5-mmol scale. Approximately 10% of the synthesis product was deprotected and cleaved from the phenylacetomidalmethyl support resin. The species corresponding to the native sequence of gurmarin (as identified by MS) was purified using reverse-phase HPLC (rpHPLC) on a Vydac C18 column (4.6 Â 250 mm, 5 mm particles) with a linear gradient of 25±34% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 28 min. The reduced lyophilised peptide was dissolved in 10 mm HCl to a final concentration of 40 mm. The dissolved peptide was then mixed with an equal volume of 0.2 m Mops (pH 7.3), containing 0.4 m KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm GSH and 2 mm GSSG, and folding was allowed to proceed at room temperature under an N2 atmosphere. At various times after initiation of the folding reaction, aliquots were removed and quenched by the addition of 0.05 vol. of concentrated phosphoric acid. These aliquots were analysed using rpHPLC to monitor the progress of the reaction. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 72 h before quenching by titration to low pH with HCl. The reaction mixture was subsequently dialysed against water to remove the folding-buffer components, then the dialysate was lyophilised.

The lyophilised mixture was then dissolved in water and the fully oxidised gurmarin was purified using rpHPLC with a linear gradient of 28±36% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 18 min. NMR spectroscopy An NMR sample was prepared by dissolving 3 mg of gurmarin in 280 mL 95% H2O/5% 2H2O in a 5-mm outer diameter susceptibility-matched microcell (Shigemi, Tokyo, Japan) and adjusting the pH to 2.9. As previously noted [5], a significant amount of precipitation was observed at pH values . 3.0 as the pH approached the pI of the protein (the calculated pI for gurmarin is < 3.5). However, the narrow linewidths observed in the NMR spectra indicate that gurmarin does not selfassociate at pH 2.9. For experiments in 2H2O, the sample was lyophilised and reconstituted in a microcell in 280 mL 99.96% 2 H2O (Sigma). All NMR spectra were recorded at 25 8C using a 5-mm 1H probe on a 600-MHz Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer. The following homonuclear two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra were recorded: double-quantum-filtered COSY (DQF-COSY) [6] with phase cycling modified for fast recycle times [7], TOCSY [8] with MLEV isotropic mixing periods of 70 ms and 100 ms, exclusive correlation spectroscopy (ECOSY) [9], and NOESY [10] with mixing times of 60 and 250 ms. Water suppression was achieved by irradiation at its resonance frequency during the relaxation delay between transients (1.2±1.4 s) and during the mixing period in NOESY experiments. All pulse sequences were modified by the insertion of a SCUBA sequence [11] before the first 90 8 pulse in order to facilitate the recovery of bleached Ha resonances. Spectra were processed using xwinnmr software (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) running on an Indy R4000 workstation (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA, USA). The DQFCOSY, TOCSY and NOESY spectra were analysed using the program xeasy [12] in order to obtain sequence-specific resonance assignments and complete NOE assignments. Distance restraints were derived from the intensities of cross-peaks in NOESY spectra recorded in H2O and 2H2O with mixing times of 250 ms. Care was taken to eliminate possible spindiffusion effects by excluding cross-peaks that increased significantly in intensity relative to other cross-peaks when the NOESY mixing time was increased from 60 to 250 ms. Hydrogen±deuterium exchange experiments were carried out by lyophilising the H2O sample, reconstituting it in 280 mL of 99.96% 2H2O, and running 18 consecutive one-dimensional (1D) spectra over a period of 120 min, followed by six consecutive 3.5-h 2D TOCSY spectra (2048 Â 128 points, 80 scans) and three consecutive 7-h 2D TOCSY spectra (2048 Â 128 points, 160 scans). Amides present in the first 2D spectrum (midpoint < 4 h after the addition of 2H2O) were interpreted to be hydrogen-bond donors. Structure calculations NOESY cross-peaks were integrated in xeasy and subsequently converted to distance restraints (with pseudoatoms where appropriate) using the caliba macro in the program dyana [13]; this yielded 612 non-redundant interproton distance restraints. The calibration functions used were V = A/r6 for backbone atoms, V = B/r4 for side-chain protons, and V = C/r4 for methyl protons, where V is the cross-peak volume and r is the corresponding interproton distance. The variables A, B, and C were automatically calibrated as previously described [41]. Dihedral-angle restraints were derived from 3JHNHa coupling

constants [14] measured from either 1D NMR spectra or by inverse Fourier transform of in-phase NOESY multiplets using the program infit [15]. The f angle was restrained to 2120 ^ 308 for 3JHNHa . 8 Hz. Stereospecific assignment of methylene protons and x1 dihedral-angle restraints were derived using 3JHaHb2 and 3JHaHb3 coupling constants measured from ECOSY spectra in combination with HN ±Hb2, HN ±Hb3, Ha ±Hb2, and Ha ±Hb3 NOE intensities [16] measured from the 60-ms NOESY experiment. Ranges of ^ 30 8 were used for all x1 dihedral-angle restraints. The torsion angle dynamics program dyana was used to calculate 1000 structures from random starting conformations. The disulfide bonds (i±j) were restrained in accordance with the disulfide bonding pattern previously determined for Ê gurmarin [17] by applying restraints of 2.0 # d # 2.1 A for g g Ê for Cb ±Sg, and Sg ±Cb. HydroSi ±Sj , and 3.0 # d # 3.1 A i j i j gen-bond donors identified from the hydrogen±deuterium exchange experiment were used to determine hydrogen-bond Ê (i±j) restraints of 1.7 # d # 2.2 A for HN ±Oj and 2.7 # d i Ê # 3.2 A for Ni ±Oj in cases where hydrogen-bond acceptors could be unambiguously determined on the basis of preliminary structure calculations. The best 100 structures (selected on the basis of their final penalty-function values) were then refined in xplor [18] as described previously [4].

Chemical synthesis and folding After chemical synthesis of gurmarin, 10% of the resin was cleaved with HF, then the cleavage products were filtered and lyophilised, yielding 150 mg of crude synthesis product. The cleavage mixture was then dissolved in 50±200 mm dithiothreitol and the mixture was separated using rpHPLC (Fig. 2A) to yield < 8 mg of pure reduced peptide. The molecular mass of the purified peptide was shown by electrospray MS to correspond to that expected for fully reduced gurmarin (experimental mass = 4215 Da; theoretical mass = 4215 Da). The purified peptide was lyophilised, then dissolved in redox buffer to facilitate oxidation/folding of the synthetic gurmarin. The folding reaction was monitored using rpHPLC over a period of 72 h (Fig. 2B). The major peak visible by 3 h corresponded to fully oxidised gurmarin and by 72 h this species represented more than 60% of the total peptide in the folding reaction (Fig. 2C). Purification of this dominant peak using rpHPLC yielded < 5 mg of pure gurmarin. This peptide was later shown to have essentially the same 1H-NMR chemical

Pharmacological studies Sprague±Dawley rats of either sex were anaesthetised with halothane and then killed by cervical dislocation. Single periaqueductal grey (PAG) or trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurones were prepared for recording as previously described [19,20]. Briefly, neurones were acutely dissociated from midbrain slices containing the PAG by gentle trituration after a 2-min treatment with papain (20 units´mL21); TG neurones were isolated after treatment of the minced ganglia with collagenase (200 units´mL21) and papain (20 units´mL21) for 20 min. Recordings of Na+ and Ca2+ channel currents were made using standard whole-cell patch-clamp techniques [21] at room temperature (22±24 8C). For recordings of Na+ currents, cells were perfused with a solution containing 80 mm NaCl, 55 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm CsCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose and 0.05% BSA, pH 7.3. Recordings were made with fire-polished borosilicate pipettes of 2±4 MV resistance when filled with an intracellular solution of the following composition: 110 mm CsCl, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgATP, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3. Neurones were voltage-clamped at 290 mV, and Na+ currents were evoked by stepping the membrane potential to 220 mV for 10 ms after a 100-ms prepulse at 2120 mV. The Na+ current was evoked every 10 s and monitored for at least 5 min before drugs were applied. Series resistance compensation of at least 80% was used in all experiments. Leak current was subtracted on line using a P/8 protocol; typically the leak conductance was less than 0.1 nS. Na+ currents were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20±50 kHz. Ca2+ channel currents were recorded as previously described [20]. Briefly, the external solution contained 140 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 4 mm BaCl2, 2.5 mm CsCl, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose and 0.05% BSA, pH 7.3; the internal solution comprised 110 mm CsCl, 5 mm MgATP, 0.2 mm Na2GTP, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3. Data were collected and analysed off line with the pclamp suite of programs (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA). Neurones were exposed to

shift values as those previously published for native gurmarin isolated from G. sylvestre [5], indicating that the native conformation had been obtained in the folding reaction. Resonance assignments Complete sequence-specific 1H resonance assignments, with the exception of the terminal side chain H1 resonance of Lys32, were determined for all residues using standard methods [22]. Chemical-shift values have been deposited with BioMag ResBank (BMRB accession number 4185). Sequential Ha ±HN or Hb ±HN connectivities were observed along the entire peptide sequence, interrupted only by the two proline residues, Pro12 and Pro20. The sequential connectivities are illustrated in the fingerprint region of the NOESY spectrum in Fig. 3. The Ile11±Pro12 peptide bond was identified as being in the trans conformation (v < 1808) on the basis of strong NOEs between the Hd protons of Pro12 and the Ha and HN protons of the preceding residue, whereas the Glu19±Pro20 peptide bond was identified as being in the cis conformation (v < 08) on the basis of strong NOEs between the Ha of Pro20 and the Ha and HN protons of the preceding residue [22]. The amide resonances of residues Ile11±Leu15 are substantially broadened, indicative of a process in which these residues are exchanging between two or more distinct conformations. Distance and dihedral-angle restraints A total of 612 non-redundant interproton distance restraints were derived from 2D NOESY spectra in 2H2O and H2O. The distance restraints can be subdivided into 135 intraresidue, 184 sequential, 92 medium range (1 , |i ± j| # 5), and 201 longrange (|i ± j| . 5). Backbone f dihedral angles were restrained to 2120 ^ 308 for residues Glu8, Ile11, Asp16, Cys17, Glu22, Lys24, Val26, Trp29, Asn30, His31, Lys32 and Ile34 (3JHNHa . 8 Hz). Stereospecific assignments of Hb protons and x1 dihedralangle restraints were derived for residues Cys3 (x1 = 608),

Cys18 (x1 = ±608), and His31 (x1 = ±608) using 3JHaHb coupling constants in combination with HN ±Hb and Ha ±Hb NOE intensities. Stereospecific assignment of the Hb protons of Pro12 was achieved on the basis that Ha is always closer to Hb3 than to Hb2 [23]. Additional x1 restraints were obtained for residues in which one large and one small 3JHaHb coupling constant was observed (Cys10, Tyr14, Cys17 and Cys33) by constraining x1 to 1508 , x1 , ±308 in order to exclude the g2 rotamer (x1 = 608). Slowly exchanging amides were identified for residues Glu8, Cys10, Cys18, Glu22, Lys24, Val26, Lys32, Cys33 and Ile34, and this information was used to identify hydrogen-bond restraints for structure calculations. Slowly exchanging amides were also identified for residues Val4, Lys5 and Leu21 but hydrogen-bond acceptors could not be determined unambiguously for these residues. The NMR restraints file has been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession code r2gurmr. Structure calculations Structures were calculated using a hybrid distance geometrysimulated annealing protocol [24] using the programs dyana [13] and xplor [18]. A family of 20 xplor structures with the lowest residual restraint violations was used to represent the solution structure of gurmarin (Fig. 4A); the structural statistics for this family are summarised in Table 1. These structures have good non-bonded contacts, as evidenced by the low values of the mean Lennard±Jones potential, and good covalent geometry, as evidenced by the small deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles. There are no distance or dihedralÊ angle restraint violations greater than 0.2 A and 28, respectively. The co-ordinates for the family of 20 structures have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession code 2gur. Evaluation of structures The atomic rms differences for the final 20 structures with respect to the mean co-ordinate positions (residues 3±34) are Ê Ê 0.27 ^ 0.09 A for the backbone atoms and 0.73 ^ 0.09 A for all heavy atoms. The f and c angular-order parameters (Sf and Sf, respectively [25]) are . 0.99 for residues 3±11, 16±19 and 23±33. In contrast, residues 1±2, 12±14 and 35 have particularly low angular-order parameters, consistent with the comparatively small number of distance restraints determined for these regions. procheck analysis [26] of the final 20 structures reveals that 90% of non-Gly, non-Pro residues are found in the most favoured and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, while 10% are found in the generously allowed regions. Analysis of the family of gurmarin structures using the program promotif [27] indicates the following secondary structure: an antiparallel b-sheet consisting of residues 22±25 and 31±34 (Fig. 5), a type-II b-turn at residues 5±8, and typeIV b-turns at residues 11±14, 12±15, 18±21, 25±28 and 27±30. A C=OI ±NHi+3 hydrogen bond is observed for the b-turn at residues 5±8 and also for the type-IV b-turn at residues 11±14 even though the amide-proton of Tyr14 was not observed to be slowly exchanging. The small hydrophobic core of gurmarin is formed by the Cys10±Cys23 and Cys17±Cys33 disulfide bonds together with the side chains of Val4, Leu15 and Leu21. The three disulfide bonds in gurmarin form a cystine-knot motif [28] in which the Cys17±Cys33 disulfide bond passes

through a 14-residue ring formed by the polypeptide backbone and the Cys3±Cys18 and Cys10±Cys23 disulfide bonds (Fig. 4B). This motif has been observed in numerous toxic and inhibitory peptides that act by either modifying the conductance properties of ion channels or by inhibiting proteases [29]. If, as has been conjectured, gurmarin functions by inhibition of a sweet-taste receptor, then this will add yet another function to this motif.

Comparison with previously published structure The backbone fold of gurmarin presented here (Fig. 4C) is in good agreement with the previously published structure of gurmarin (PDB accession code 1gur [5]), which was solved using native peptide purified from G. sylvestre. The backbone rms difference (residues 3±34) between the two structures is Ê 1.61 A. Very similar 1H chemical shift values were obtained in the two studies, with minor differences attributable to different acquisition temperatures. There is also agreement in most of the amides identified as hydrogen-bond donors, with the exception of Cys18, which we identified as slowly exchanging, and Leu9 and Ile11, which were previously identified as slowly exchanging [5] but which were not found to be in the current study. The positions of the side chains in the previously reported low-resolution gurmarin structure (1gur, family of 10 structures) were very poorly defined, with a heavy atom rms Ê difference of 1.79 ^ 0.20 A over residues 3±34, which Ê compares with 0.69 ^ 0.05 A for the best 10 structures presented here.

Selected side chains are shown in black for gurmarin and grey for d-ACTX-Hv1. The heavy atoms of these side chains overlay with an rms Ê difference of 1.40 A. Residue labels refer to gurmarin (for the d-ACTX-Hv1 equivalents, see text and Fig. 1). The figure was produced using molmol [40].

Comparison with the structure of d-ACTX-Hv1 We previously showed [4] that the backbone fold of gurmarin is very similar to that of d-ACTX-Hv1, a neurotoxin from the Australian funnel-web spider Hadronyche versuta that slows the inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels, and m-agatoxin-I from the unrelated American funnel-web spider Agelenopsis aperta. d-ACTX-Hv1 inhibits the inactivation of mammalian Na+ channels [30] in a manner similar to site-3 Na+ channel toxins such as the a-scorpion and sea anemone toxins. m-Agatoxin-I is also thought to interact with vertebrate Na+ channels,

although its electrophysiological effects remain poorly characterised [31,32]. The high-resolution structure of gurmarin presented here has facilitated a more detailed comparison with the structure of d-ACTX-Hv1. Figure 6 shows an overlay of the conserved side chains in the lowest-energy gurmarin and d-ACTX-Hv1 structures (PDB accession code 1vtx [4]). Gurmarin and d-ACTX-Hv1 show a relatively low degree of sequence homology over the aligned region (29% identity, 47% homology; Fig. 1). Remarkably, however, the side chains of all 10 identities, and two of the conservative substitutions, were found to be very similar when the two structures were overlaid (Fig. 6). These side chains include Cys3 (Cys1), Val4 (Ala2), Lys5 (Lys3), Lys6 (Lys4), Cys10 (Cys8), Asp16 (Asp13), Cys17 (Cys14), Cys18 (Cys15), Pro20 (Pro17), Leu21 (Met18), Cys23 (Cys20) and Cys33 (Cys31), where the equivalent residues in d-ACTX-Hv1 are shown in parentheses. An overlay of the heavy side-chain atoms of the residues listed above Ê results in an rms difference of 1.40 A. Interestingly, these spatially conserved residues include not only elements involved in maintenance of the tertiary structure of the polypeptides (the disulfide bonds and residues contributing to the hydrophobic core) but also charged surface residues (two Lys residues and a single Asp residue) that might be involved in the interaction with target molecules. This striking homology is particularly interesting in the light of the apparent absence of similarity in the function of the two peptides, and it suggests that gurmarin might inhibit sweet taste by modifying the conductance properties of an ion channel involved in sweet-taste transduction. Consistent with this hypothesis, two of the charged residues that are topologically conserved in gurmarin (Lys3 and Asp13 in d-ACTX-Hv1) were previously proposed to be important for electrostatic docking of d-ACTX-Hv1 into site 3 of vertebrate voltage-gated Na+ channels [4]. Pharmacological assays Of those residues previously proposed to be critical for the binding of d-ACTX-Hv1 to site-3 of voltage-gated Na+ channels [4,33], several are non-conservatively substituted in gurmarin (Arg5 3 Glu, Lys10 3 Tyr, Glu12 3 Leu, Lys19 3 Glu) but a similar number are conserved (Lys3, Lys4, Asp13 in d-ACTX-Hv1). Thus, we decided to initially examine the effect of gurmarin on the native voltage-dependent Na+ channels of rat central (PAG) and peripheral (TG) neurones.

(B) Amplitudes of the peak inward current (X) and the current at the end the voltage step (W) are plotted against time. Peptides were perfused for the duration of the bars.

Application of gurmarin (1 mm) to acutely dissociated TG neurones did not result in any apparent change in the Na+ currents of the cells (peak amplitude in gurmarin was 102 ^ 2% of predrug amplitude, n = 4). Similarly, application of gurmarin (300 nm to 1 mm) for up to 5 min did not result in any apparent change in the Na+ currents in PAG neurones (peak amplitude in gurmarin was 100 ^ 1.4% of predrug amplitude, n = 13; Fig. 7). In contrast, application of d-ACTX-Hv1 (30 nm) resulted in an immediate inhibition of the inactivation of the Na+ current in PAG neurones (Fig. 7). In some cases this inhibition of inactivation was accompanied by a modest increase in the peak Na+ current (peak amplitude after 3±5 min in d-ACTX-Hv1 was 130 ^ 16% of predrug amplitude, n = 6). While the above results indicate that gurmarin does not modulate Na+ channel currents in rat central and peripheral neurones, we conjectured that the structural similarity between gurmarin and d-ACTX might be sufficient to allow gurmarin to bind to voltage-gated channels in a manner that antagonised d-ACTX activity. However, preincubation of neurones with gurmarin (1 mm) for up to 5 min did not prevent or diminish the effects of a subsequent coapplication of d-ACTX-Hv1 (n = 4). Thus, gurmarin does not appear to bind to neuronal voltagegated Na+ channels in the vicinity of channel site 3, and its lack of current-modulating activity strongly suggests that it does not interact at all with these channels. In addition to the remarkable structural homology between gurmarin and d-ACTX-Hv1, we previously noted that the backbone fold of gurmarin is similar to that of v-agatoxin-IVB [34], a toxin from A. aperta that modulates the conductance properties of P-type Ca2+ channels [35]. These channels are widely expressed in the nervous system [36], including TG neurones (M. Connor and M. J. Christie, unpublished observations). Thus, we also examined the effect of gurmarin on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel currents of TG neurones. Gurmarin (1±3 mm) had no effect on the peak Ca2+ channel current in any cell tested (data not shown); the peak inward current was 98 ^ 3% of control in the presence of gurmarin (n = 6). In conclusion, we have determined a high-resolution structure of gurmarin which has enabled a detailed comparison with the tertiary structure of d-ACTX-Hv1, a neurotoxin that slows the inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Despite remarkable structural similarity to d-ACTX-Hv1, including structural conservation of residues thought to be important in the interaction of d-ACTX-Hv1 with voltage-gated Na+ channels [4,33], we found that gurmarin did not mimic or prevent the effects of d-ACTX-Hv1. It is possible that gurmarin acts on a type of Na+ channel that is not present in rat PAG or TG neurones, although these cells are likely to express a variety of the many different voltage-dependent Na+ channels identified to date [37]. Gurmarin did not affect Ca2+ channel currents in TG cells, indicating that it is also unlikely to be a blocker of P-type, N-type and other Ca2+ channels found in these cells. Although they eliminate several potential ion-channel targets for gurmarin, these experiments do not preclude the possibility that gurmarin acts by modulating the conductance of an ion channel subtype, the expression of which is restricted to specialised cells such as those involved in taste.
