The crystal structure of the sulfur complex of bovine liver rhodanese has been determined at a resolution of 2.1 ~ . "the threedimensional structure of this sulfur-transfer enzyme reveals two domains of roughly equal size, with nearly identical conformations and very dissimilar amino acid sequences. The active site contains four elements which are carefully positioned with respect to each other in order to obtain efficient catalysis: (i) cysteine 247, (it) a set of peptide nitrogen hydrogen bond donors, (iii) two positively charged residues, and (iv) a cluster of hydrophobic residues at the active site surface. The catalytic mechanism is described in some detail. The structures of the sulfur free enzyme and of the enzyme in complex with several metal cyanide inhihitors have been studied. These inhibitors appear to have one c o m m o n binding site, blocking the entrance to the active site pocket and thus reve-';ing the mode of inhibition by these, and probably other, anions.
INTRODUCTION Rhodaneseqs an enzyme which catalyses the transfer of a sulfane sulfur atom from sulfur donors to sulfur accepters. The best known reaction catalyzed is:
S.zO'~+CN ~ S O ~ + S C N The enzyme has been observed in bacterial, fungal, plant, fish, amphibian, reptilian, avian and mammalian organisms(Westley, 1 973; SSrbo, 1975; Oudek et al., 1980). The presence of rhodanese has recently even been demonstrated in the large tube worm, Ri/tiapachyptila, which lives in deep-sea hydrothermal vents (Felbeck. 1981 ). In mammals, the enzyme is distributed

quite unevenly with respect to the various organs, the highest activities being found in liver and kidney. A study of Reinwein (1961) on the distribution of rhodanese in human tissues showed that the highest activity was found in liver, followed by kidney, suprarenals and thyroid gland, in mammalian liver, rhodanese is confined to the mitochondria (De Duve et al,, 1955; Dudek et,~[t~ 1980), The widesprea~occurrence suggests arl important role of the enzyme. Although general agreement seems to exist that the enzyme is involved in the detoxification of cyanide, a large number of alternative, or additional, functions has been suggested (Westley. 1973, S~rbo, 1975). A possible "multifunctional" rhodanese could, for instance, also be important for

FIG. 3. Alignment of structurally equivalent residues in the two domains of rhodanese. The upper line represents the chain in the first domain, the lower line that of the second domain. The amino acid sequence numbers of the first and last residues of the equivalent chain segments are shown. The numbers in boxes give the lengths of the deletions required to bring the two sequences in register according to the three-dimensional structure. The block dots indicate the positions of the 14 equivaJent amino acid r~.~sidu~swhich are identical in both domains. (i) the detoxification of inorganic sulfide; (ii) the incorporation of sulfur in iron-sulfur centra of redox proteins (Bonomi et al., 1977a, I977b); and (iii) the maintenance of the sulfane sulfur pool in organisms (Westley, 1977, 1980). It seems hard to ascertain at present which of these additional possibilities are of real significance for the proper functioning of living organisms. A protective role of rhodanese against low level cyanide poisoning is likely because of the high concentrations observed in mammalian liveJ mitochondria. There, it would be at the correct position for defending the sensitive cytochrome c oxidase system against cyanide which may be circulating in the blood as e.g. the result of the digestion of cyanide-containing food. This may be of great importance for human populations living in areas where cassava, which contains substantial amounts of cyanogenic compounds, is an important component of the diet. In other areas, where the dependence on cyanogenic foodstuffs is virtually negligible, the importance of cyanide detoxification mechanisms is demonstrated by the occurrence of Leber's optic atrophy, a rare hereditary disease. Recently, it has been shown that rhodanese levels in the livers of patients
Fundamental and Applied Toxicology

with this condition are substantially lower than in normal individuals (Cagianut et al., 1981). This may explain the extreme sensitivity of these patients to low levels of cyanide as found in cigarette smoke (Wilson, 1965). In view of these lines of evidence, it seems warranted to focus in this contribution on the reaction between cyanide and thiosulfate, as catalyzed by rhodanese. This sulfur-transfer reaction has been shown by Westley and collaborators to occur in two well-defined steps (Westley and Nakamoto, 1962): S20~ + Rh = RhS + SO~ CN- + RhS = Rh + SCN" where RhS is a "'sulfur-rhodanese" intermediate, which is surprisingly stable in the absence of sulfur acceptors such as cyanide. From a series of mechanistic studies it became evident that bovine liver rhodanese contained a number of essential features in its active center (Westley, 1973, 1977): (i) an essential sulphydryl group; (ii) a hydrophobic region; (iii) a cationic region containing two positive charges (Leininger & Westley, 1968).

(1976). Hereto, six heavy atom derivatives were prepared of which the p-chloromercury benzene sulfonate and the sodium perrhenate derivatives were the most powerful. Intensities were collected on a 4-circle single-crystal diffractometer. From a 2.5 ~ resolution electron density map, a KendrewWatson model of the molecule was constructed (Ploegman et al., 1978a). This molecular model was subsequently refined with data to 2.1 ~ resolution, using constrained and restrained refinement techniques. This has improved considerably the accuracy of the atomic positions and led to valuable information on the thermal motions of the atoms and positions of solvent molecules (Lijk, Van Nes, Kalk and Hol, in preparation). THE ARCHITECTURE A N D EVOLUTION OF THE RHODANESE MOLECULE The crystallographic studies revealed a remarkable feature of bovine liver rhodanese. The polypeptide chain is folded into two so-called "domains", of virtually equal size (Figure 1). Domain I consists of residues 1 to 142 and domain II comprises residues 159 to 293. The residues 143 to 158 belong to an exposed loop which connects the two domains. The folding of the polypeptide chain in the two domains is very similar. This is already apparent from Figure 2 where the secondary structure elements, ~-helices and #-strands, of the molecule are indicated. Each domain consists of a fivestranded parallel #-sheet, flanked on both sides by a-helices. When precise superpositions of the C" atoms of the two domains are carried out, it appears that 117 residues can be superimposed with a r.m.s, difference of 1.78 A. This is a small number and one would expect that such a close similarity in folding pattern is due to a substantial amino acid sequence ho'mology between the two domains. As Figure 3 illustrates, the number of residues with identical amino acids in equivalent positions is only 14, i.e. 13%. In addition, several insertions and deletions are required to obtain an optimal superposition of the two domains (Figure 3). This marginal similarity in sequence is in sharp contrast with the closely related conformations of the two domains. It remains a complete puzzle, but a great challenge to understand it at the same time, why two such dissimilar sequences give rise to such similar three-dimentional structures. The superposition showed furthermore, that the two domains are related by a pseudo-twofold axis: the rotation deviates less than one degree from 180 ° and the translation parallel to the two-fold axis is less than one .~ngstrSm. The architecture of the rhodanese molecule suggests that it may be a product of gene duplication and subsequent gene fusion in the course of evolution. After the duplication event, the two subunits probably formed a dimer, which later became a monomer of twice the size. After gene duplication, the amino acid sequences began to differ, while also deletions and insertions occurred which led eventually to the molecule we see at the present day. How little is preserved of the presumed original sequence identity, is illustrated in Figure 3, whereas Table 1 shows that none out of the 14 salt bridges occurring in the molecule has an equivalent counterpart in the other domain. More detailed analyses of the sequence and structure of bovine liver rhodanese are given by Ploegman et a/. (1978b) and Keim et aL (1981).

"The distance between the side chains of these residues is 10/~ which is much larger than the 3 to 4 t~ required f o r a salt bridge.

The remainder of this paper will show that these inferences from chemical and kinetic studies were completely correct. Bovine liver rhodanese contains a total of 293 residues in a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 32 000. The amino acid sequence has been elucidated by Heinrikson and co-workers (Ploegman et al., 1978a; Russell etal., 1978). In our laboratory, the three-dimensional structure has been determined by means of X-ray diffraction in a number of steps ( S m i t e t al., 1974; Bergsma et aL, 1975; Ploegman etal., 1978b; Lijk etal., in preparation) giving us a detailed picture of the architecture of this enzyme and a precise view of the nature and location of the atoms in its active center. This has led to the proposal of a mechanism for the sulfur transfer reaction (Ploegman eta/., 1979) and to an understanding of the mode of action of a number of inhibitors (Lijk, Kalk, Brandenburg and Hol, submitted for publication). In this contribution a number of the interesting properties of the bovine liver rhodanese molecule will be discussed. DETERMINA T/ON OF THE THREEDIPRENSIONAL STRUCTURE The method used for isolating rhodanese from bovine liver was essentially that of Horowitz and De Toma (1970). Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were grown from a 2.0 M ammonium sulfate solution, pH 7.3, in the presence of 1 mM sodium thiosulfate. Shortly before mounting the crystal in a capillary for data collection, the thiosulfate was removed by soaking the crystal in a 2.0 M ammonium sulfate solution of pH 7.3, in order to reduce radiation damage by the X-ray beam. The form of rhodanese present in the crystal after this procedure is still the sulfur-rhodanese complex. The multiple-isomorphous replacement method was used for solving the three-dimensional structure. For further details of this method the reader is referred to Blundell and Johnson

loop, as sketched in Figure 1. At the bottom of the pocket cysteine 247 is siluated. The electron density map clearly shows that the extra sulfur atom of sulfur rhodanese is attached as a persulfide to the sulfhydryl group of this essential cysteine residue (Ploegman el aL, 1979). This is in agreement with the interpretation of spectroscopic studies (Finazzi Agrc~ er al., 1972). The persulfide is stabilized by a large number of hydrogen bonds with backbone NH groups and with the hydroxyl group of Thr 252 (Figure 4). Close to the active site, several hydrophobic residues cluster together: Trp 35, Phe 106, Tyr 107, Trp 212 and Va1251 which are all in contact with the solvent region (Figure 4}. Although the importance of this hydrophobic patch at one side of the active center is not clear for the reaction between cyanide and thiosulfate, it is obvious that it could play a role in binding other substrates like aromatic and aliphatic thiosulfonates. It also seems likely that this region is in contact with the aromatic moiety of inhibitors such as benzene sulfonate, when bound at the active site. A further interesting arrangement near the active silo entrance is a salt bridge network involving no less than six residues: Glu 71, Arg 248, Glu 193, Arg 182, Asp 180 and Arg

186 (Ploegman et aL, 1979). Of these residues, Arg 186 is situated at the entrance of the active site playing an important role in the electrostatic interactions which take place during the catalytic process. A second positive charge'at the active site entrance is provided by the {-amino group of Lys 249 (Figure 4). The presence of these two charges is in agreement with the conclusions drawn by Leininger and Westley (1968) on the basis of ionic strength dependent kinetic measurements. The four elements at the active site of bovine liver rhodanese: (i) the sulfhydryl group of Cys 247; (ii) the " r i n g " of persulfide-stabilizing NH-groups; (iii) two positive charges at the entrance of the pocket, and (iv) a hydrophobic patch, are the essential ingredients for an efficient transfer of sulfur atoms from suitable donor molecules to acceptors. The role of the hydrophobic region has not been investigated by crystallographic studies and will therefore not receive further attention. The catalytic mechanism as proposed in Figure 5 is based on the three-dimensional structure observed by X-ray investigations and on the establishment of the double displacemont mechanism by the group of Westley. It is furthermore assumed that the three-dimensional structure of the "sulfur-free'" enzyme is very similar to that of sulfur rhodanese as observed

FIG. b. Simplified diagram of the proposed steps in the reaction of sulfur rhodanese with cyanide (a) resulting in the formation of isothiocyanate and the regeneration of rhodanese (e),

in the crystalline state. Evidence for this comes from a number of studies in which the extra sulfur has been removed in the crystals by treatment with cyanide. The resultant structure differs only marginally from that of sulfur-rhodanese (Ploegman et aL, 1979; Lijk, Kalk, Brandenburg and Hol, submitted for publication). Other lines of evidence exist (WesHey, 1977), which suggest that a significant change in conformation occurs upon binding of the first substrate, thiosulfate, which is only reversed upon release of the final product, thiocyanate. Even if this event would actually happen in solution, it Would only require a minor modification of the mechanism shown in Figures 5 and 6, namely the addition of a conformational change at the beginning and at the very end of the catalytic cycle. The reaction starts with the replacement of solvent molecules in the active site pocket by a thiosulfate ion (Figure 5). Electrostatic interactions with the positive charges of Arg 1(]6 and Lys 249 side chains play an important role at this stage. Once bound at the active site entrance, the sulfhydryl group of Cys 247 performs a nucleophilic attack on the outer sulfur atom of thiosulfate. The resultant transition state intermediate (Figure 5c) is probably stabilized by hydrogen bonds from the "ring" of NH groups which, in the next step, also stabilizes the persulfide of suSfur rhodanese. The first product, sulfite, is
Fund=mental and Applied Tox]colo|y

released from the enzyme and replaced by a solvent molecule. The sulfur rhodanese complex obtained is unusually stable in the absence of suitable sulfur acceptor molecules. However, in the presence of cyanide a very fast, diffusion limited, reaction occurs which is essentially the reverse of the first reaction cycle {Figure 6): the sulfur atom is transferred from the persulfide to the cyanide ion and, in the final step, the product thiocyanate is replaced by a solvent molecule. Sulfurfree rhodanese is thus regenerated which may catalyse another sulfur transfer reaction. INHIBITION BY METAL C Y A N I D E S A N D 0 TILER A N I O N S A variety of metal cyanides are reported to be inhibitors of bovine liver rhodanese (Volini et al., 1978). This has led to an X-ray investigation of the mode of binding of metal cyanides to rhodanese. Platinum cyanide, Pt(CN);, a~d 9old cyanide, Au(CN)~, were studied as a complex with sulfur rhodanese, whereas nickel cyanide, Ni(CN):~, and zinc cyanide Zn(CN):, were complexed with sulfur-free rhodanese in the crystalline state (Lijk, Kalk, Brandenburg and Hol, 19~3). The conclusions from these studies are very clear. All these metal cyanides, irrespective of the nature of the metal and independent of the

presence of the extra sulfur atom, bind at one common position: at the entrance to the active site, in ionic interaction with the side chains of Arg 186 and Lys 249. Access to the essential Cys 247 residue is blocked in this manner which provides an elegant explanation for the inhibitory effect of these compounds. From the high resolution studies and selenate replacement experiments (Lijk et al., in preparation) it has been established that sulfate ions also bind at this position at the entrance to active site pocket (see also Figure 4). This explains the inhibition of the reaction by sulfate ions. From these observations, it is clear that this anion binding site is also a likely position for other inhibitors such as oxalate and ~-ketoglutarate (Oi, 1975; Wang and Volini, 1973).

CONCLUSION The crystallographic investigations described above have provided, in conjunction with the amino acid sequence determination and a wealth of kinetic results, a detailed picture of the bovine liver rhodanese molecule, in particular of the active site. A catalytic mechanism can be proposed in which three elements, a sulfhydryl group, a set of peptide nitrogen hydrogen bond donors and two positively charged side chains, are carefully positioned with respect to each other such that an efficient catalysis of the transfer of one single sulfur atom is ensured. The mode of inhibition of a wide variety of anions can be explained by binding to the two positive charges near the active site entrance thereby blocking access of the substrates to the essential sulfhydryl group. A complete surprise of the crystal structure of rhodanese was the similarity of the conformation of the two domains, particularly in view of the large differences in amino acid sequence. Understanding this observation on the basis of physical chemical principles remains a challenge for theoretical biophysical chemistry.
