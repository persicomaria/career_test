Acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) is widely considered as a functional and structural homologue of the ligand binding domain of Cys-loop receptors. We report the use of AChBP as template to identify ligands for the nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). An in silico screening protocol was set up and applied to crystal structures of AChBP. Several ligands containing a dibenzosuberyl moiety were identified and shown to bind with high affinity to AChBP and R7 nAChRs. Two high affinity ligands were cocrystallized with AChBP, revealing the binding mode in the orthosteric site. Functional studies revealed that these two ligands caused inhibition of the R7, R4 2, and 5HT3 receptors. The noncompetive blockade of the receptors suggests that these compounds act by steric hindrance of the channel. The analysis of the dual binding mode of these dibenzosuberyl-containing compounds can lead to better understanding of the complex mode of action of similar tricyclic ligands on Cys-loop receptors.
Introduction The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR ) is the prototypical member of the Cys-loop receptor family of ligand-gated ion channels that also includes the glycine, -aminobutyric acid (GABA-A and GABA-C), and serotonin (5-HT3) receptors.1 The nAChR is considered a major drug target, since neuronal nAChR subtypes are associated with brain diseases with high occurrence in the Western world. The human R4 2 and R7 nAChRs are likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and anxiety.1 In addition, the human R4 2 nAChR is involved in nicotine addiction and pain1 whereas the human R7 nAChR might also be a pharmacological target in inflammation.2 Several nicotinic receptor ligands are being investigated for clinical use.3 The first successes were reported in 2006, when varenicline, a partial agonist on the R4 2 nAChR, was approved as a drug for smoking cessation.4 In spite of this important progress, discovery of nAChR specific ligands remains a challenge where a better knowledge of the binding site will represent a decisive step forward. Structure-based drug discovery procedures to identify novel and selective ligands cannot be performed directly on the

available three-dimensional structures of nAChRs because no high-resolution crystal structures of eukaryote nAChRs exist. Detailed knowledge of the structural architecture of the binding pocket has become available after the identification and structure determination of a eukaryotic homologue of the nAChR extracellular domain, namely, the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP).5,6 AChBPs from different snail species have been identified, and ligand-bound cocrystal structures have been determined.6-13 Very recently, the first crystal structure of a prokaryotic homologue of the nAChR from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi was solved,14 but ligands for this receptor are unknown. The crystal structures of the AChBPs from three different snail species show a conserved architectural fold that has been recognized as a template to construct homology models for the ligand binding domains of mammalian neurotransmitter receptors.6,10,11 Crucial information on ligand-receptor interactions has been obtained from agonist-bound structures of AChBP, i.e., carbamylcholine, nicotine, and epibatidine.8,12 Similar cation- interactions between a conserved tryptophan and a cationic center in nonpeptidic nicotinic receptor ligands are observed in these cocrystal structures. Recently, we and others have determined cocrystal structures of AChBP from Aplysia californica (Ac-AChBP) in complex with the competitive inhibitor R-conotoxins7,11 from venomous cone snails and from Lymnaea stagnalis (Ls-AChBP) in complex with nonpeptidic nAChR agonists.7,8,11,12 Knowledge of the chemical interactions between these ligands and the receptor binding site has given detailed insight into the molecular determinants required for subtype-selective ligand binding.7,8,10,12 We hypothesized that the rational discovery of new lead compounds with improved subtype selectivity for human nAChRs could be pursued by using crystal structures of AChBP as templates within in silico screening procedures. In the past, successful in silico screenings have been performed using crystal structures of various protein targets.15-18 At the heart of these procedures are docking algorithms that aim to predict the optimal

binding pose of ligands inside the binding pocket and their corresponding ligand-receptor interaction energy, i.e. tightness of binding. For this purpose, scoring functions are used to estimate ligand-receptor complementarity and the highest scoring binding poses generally show good intermolecular interaction of ligand and receptor.19,20 Numerous combinations of docking algorithms and scoring functions have been explored in the literature.15,16,19,20 In the present study, we applied the frequently used and thoroughly validated combination of the GOLD docking program and the GoldScore scoring function21 using three different Ls-AChBP structures. The screening procedure was applied to a proprietary compound collection and consists of the actual docking, visual inspection for the binding pose, pharmacological assays, and an analogue search. Using this approach, we discovered novel classes of small molecule AChBP ligands, some of which also have good affinity for the human R7 nAChR. To gain insight into the interaction of these ligands and the receptor binding site, we cocrystallized two novel tricyclic hit compounds that were obtained from the in silico screen with AChBP. These structures provided novel insight in structure-based hit optimization and procedures to obtain subtype selective agonists for human nAChRs. Moreover, the results illustrate the use and limitations of the AChBP structure as a template in an in silico screening for novel nAChR ligands. Results In Silico Screening and Pharmacological Characterization. In order to discover novel ligands for human nAChRs, we carried out in silico screening studies using AChBP as template. Docking studies were performed using the three available crystal structures of Ls-AChBP, i.e., the AChBP complexes with

carbamylcholine (PDB accession code 1uv6), HEPES (PDB accession code 1ux2), and nicotine (PDB accession code 1uw6).12 Bound ligands and water molecules were removed from the AChBP models, whereafter in silico screening of an in-house compound collection containing druglike molecules was performed using the GOLD21 docking program in combination with the GoldScore scoring function. The compounds were ranked according to their scores and the top-ranked 50 compounds were visually inspected for their binding pose. The topranked compounds with favorable binding poses, e.g. cation- interactions, hydrogen bonding, and steric complementarity, were tested for [125I]R-bungarotoxin (125I-Bgt) displacement on Ls-AChBP using a single ligand concentration (100 µM) (Figure 1). A first subset of nine compounds was identified from docking simulations using the carbamylcholine-AChBP structure. None of these compounds showed full 125I-Bgt displacement (compounds 1-9, Figure 1), even at a high concentration of 100 µM. Nevertheless, eight compounds display 20% or higher displacement of radioligand, including one compound with 60% radioligand displacement. A second subset of 12 compounds was selected in an in silico screen on the HEPES-AChBP structure. Nine of these 12 compounds displaced 125I-Bgt to the same extent as nicotine (compounds 10 - 21, Figure 1). The final in silico screen was performed on the nicotine-AChBP structure. The top-ranked list included five of the compounds already identified in the screen on the HEPES-AChBP structure (compounds 13-15, 18, 20). Four additional compounds were selected for single point displacement assays, and all of them showed 125I-Bgt displacement similar to nicotine (compounds 22 - 25, Figure 1).

Figure 2. Structures of known tricyclic nAChR ligands.

In total, we selected 16 compounds using the HEPES and nicotine bound AChBP structures in the in silico screening, and we determined their binding affinity for Ls-AChBP. We identified 13 compounds with a similar affinity for Ls-AChBP as nicotine. In contrast, binding affinities for Ls-AChBP of a randomly selected set of compounds from our compound collection resulted in an 8-fold lower hit rate, validating the high enrichment obtained from the in silico screening protocol. Inspection of the identified hit structures revealed a compound that contained a tricyclic (dibenzosuberyl) moiety (11, Figure 2). This moiety is reminiscent of the pharmacophore found in certain psychotropic drugs, such as the class of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, 26, Figure 2). In early studies, these promiscuous drugs were suggested to bind to the ion channel pore of nAChRs.22 Other known tricyclic nAChR ligands include the antiepileptic carbamazepine (27, Figure 2) and the tricyclic interferon inducer tilorone (28, Figure 2) that was very recently identified by Abbott researchers as a selective partial agonist for R7 nAChRs.23 Being intrigued by our tricyclic hit structure 11, we searched our proprietary database for other dibenzosuberyl-containing derivatives. A total of 13 compounds were available, and 125IBgt displacement assays on Ls-AChBP revealed that these ligands have affinities in the same range as those found for acetylcholine and nicotine (compounds 29-41, pKi values of 5.5-7.2, Tables 1 and 2, Figure 3). When taking compound 29 as a reference compound of this series, we showed that methylation of the tropine nitrogen atom does not have a significant effect on the Ls-AChBP affinity. However, increasing the substituent by a hydrophobic ethyl group or a benzyl moiety increases the binding affinity. More polar substituents that are attached to the tropine nitrogen atom lead to somewhat lower affinity compounds (36, 37, 38). Substitution of the R3 position on the aromatic ring leads to a significant increase in affinity, whereas a similar small substituent in the R4 position does not alter the binding to AChBP. Interestingly, tropine containing ligands have significantly higher affinity for Ls-AChBP than their piperidine analogues (Table 2; compare 39 with 29 and compare 40 with 30). Compound 41 indicates that attachment of bigger hydrophobic substituents can increase the binding affinity, as was shown for the tropine derivatives. The highest affinity was observed for compounds 31 and 35 (Table 1, Figure 3), and these were comparable to that of nicotine (31 pKi ) 7.2 ( 0.1, 35 pKi ) 7.0 ( 0.1, nicotine pKi ) 7.2 ( 0.1, on Ls-AChBP). We note that both 31 and 35 as well as nicotine were not within the top-ranked compounds that were visually inspected. The structural identity of these compounds and their binding affinities for the target proteins were

confirmed by resynthesis, chemical characterization of the synthesized molecules, and retesting. Subsequently, we tested these compounds in a 125I-Bgt displacement assay on SH-SY5Y cells, which have previously been shown to express the human R7 nAChR.24,25 Interestingly, 31 binds with affinity comparable to nicotine, whereas 35 has a lower affinity (31 pKi ) 5.7 ( 0.2, 35 pKi ) 4.9 ( 0.1, nicotine pKi ) 6.0 ( 0.1, on human R7 nAChR). This illustrates small differences between the AChBP and R7 nAChR binding sites that are probed by this series of compounds. Finally, these two compounds were tested in an [3H]epibatidine displacement assay on human R4 2 nAChRs (transiently transfected in HEK293t cells), and no binding was observed. This is in line with the similar pharmacological characteristics of Ls-AChBP and the human R7 nAChR.5,6 Cocrystal Structures of 31 and 35 with Ac-AChBP.

the structural recognition of these newly discovered compounds by the AChBP binding site, we solved cocrystal structures of AChBP with selected compounds obtained in our in silico screening. The dibenzosuberyl-containing analogues 31 and 35, which have the highest affinity for Ls-AChBP and show selectivity for the human R7 nAChR, were selected as the best candidates for cocrystallization with AChBP. Because cocrystals of Ac-AChBP often have better diffraction quality than those obtained with Ls-AChBP, we cocrystallized 31 and 35 with AcAChBP. Both compounds were tested in [3H]epibatidine displacement studies on Ac-AChBP, and their binding affinities were similar to the affinity of nicotine (31 pKi ) 6.3 ( 0.2, 35 pKi ) 6.0 ( 0.2, nicotine pKi ) 6.4 ( 0.1, on Ac-AChBP). The structure of Ac-AChBP in complex with 31 was solved by molecular replacement at 2.7 Å resolution. The model was refined to Rwork ) 23.7% and Rfree ) 26.7% with good geometry (Table 3). The structure of the 31-bound complex is similar to other complexes of Ac-AChBP except that loop C, which wraps around the ligand-binding site, has a conformation that is intermediate between the fully contracted state observed in AChBP complexes with agonists and the extended state observed in complexes with antagonists such as R-conotoxins. In the complex of Ac-AChBP with 31, the maximal outward displacement of loop C amounts to 4.8 Å, as measured between the Cys188 CR atom in this complex and the HEPESbound complex of Ac-AChBP (Figures 4A,B). In comparison, the distance between the Cys188 CR atom in the R-conotoxin bound complex and the HEPES-bound complex is 11 Å. Loop C displays this intermediate conformation at all binding sites of the two pentamers present in the asymmetric unit. The binding orientation for 31 (Figure 4C) could only be resolved from difference electron density at two binding sites, which are also involved in a crystal contact between the two pentamers in the

asymmetric unit. The remaining sites contain partial density for 31, suggesting that part of the ligand may adopt multiple conformations in the binding pocket. To provide additional experimental evidence for the binding mode of 31 in AChBP, we also solved the crystal structure of Ac-AChBP in complex with 35, which crystallizes in a different crystal packing symmetry. The structure of this complex was determined at 2.8 Å resolution, and the model was refined to Rwork ) 20.0% and Rfree ) 25.0% with good geometry (Table 3). The asymmetric unit contains one pentamer, which has four binding sites characterized by an "intermediately" extended conformation of loop C, similar to the complex with 31. The distance between the Cys188 CR atom in the 35 bound complex and the HEPES-bound complex is 6.8 ( 0.4 Å. Loop C of the fifth binding site is in the fully extended conformation because of its interaction with the extreme carboxy terminus of a neighboring pentamer in the crystal packing. This portion of the protein, Arg206-Asp217, was found to be disordered in all previous AChBP structures and was now for the first time built into electron density. The extreme C-terminus lacks secondary structure and extends along the surface of AChBP. The 12 amino acids that constitute the C-terminus are highly variable between different AChBPs and have no homology to the amino acid sequence that forms the interface with the transmembrane domain in nAChRs. It is therefore unlikely that knowledge of this structure adds to our understanding of receptor function. Compound 35 could be fit automatically into difference electron density at two binding sites. The binding mode of 35 in these sites shows that the orientation of the molecule is similar to 31 except that the dibenzosuberyl moiety is rotated by 90° around the ether bond (Figure 4D). This observation supports the possibility that a certain degree of rotational or vibrational freedom of the tricyclic moiety around the ether bond exists and that this portion of the molecule might therefore be disordered in some binding sites. Partial density is observed in two binding sites of the 35 complex, indicating that the ligand adopts multiple conformations at these sites of the complex as well. The binding site involved in the crystal contact with the C-terminus of a neighboring pentamer reveals clear electron density for 35 but rotated by 160° with respect to the orientation observed in the other sites that do not interact with a C-terminal domain. At this particular site, 35 interacts with the side chains of Arg213 and Leu215 and the backbone of Asn214 of the C-terminal domain instead of the residues from the complementary binding site. Although not relevant to our understanding of the binding mode in nAChRs, this ligand orientation induced by the interaction with the nonconserved C-terminal domain from Ac-AChBP indicates that the binding mode is highly dependent on the chemical environment of the ligand. We find that the binding orientations of 31 and 35 are different from the orientations predicted in the in silico screen. As illustrated in Figures 5A,B, our docking studies suggested two possible orientations of 31 within the contracted C-loop model of Ls-AChBP with the dibenzosuberyl moiety pointing either upward or downward in the binding cavity. Our crystal structures demonstrate that both 31 and 35 displace loop C outward by 5-6 Å, and as a result, the ligand occupies the binding pocket of Ac-AChBP in an orientation different from the one predicted in the in silico screen (parts C and E of Figure 5). In the orientation shown in parts C and E of Figure 5, 31 and 35 have their ethylene bridge of the tropine moiety pointing away from the aromatic residues of the principal face. At the

Figure 4. Ac-AChBP crystal structures in complex with HEPES (yellow), R-conotoxin (red), and 31 (blue) have been superposed (A) to illustrate the displacement of loop C upon ligand binding (B). Crystals of Ac-AChBP in the apo state (green) showed a lack of electron density for loop C, indicating that this region is flexible in the absence of ligand. 31 and 35 displace loop C (Cys188 CR atoms) by 5 Å when compared to the HEPES-bound structure. The R-conotoxin-bound structure displaces loop C by 11 Å. The binding poses of 31 (C) and 35 (D) have been resolved from difference electron density.

obtained resolution of diffraction data (2.6-2.8 Å) we cannot exclude an alternative conformation in which the ethylene bridge of the tropine moiety faces the aromatic residues (parts D and F of Figure 5). However, this conformation may be less favorable because it partially shields the electron-rich cage formed by the aromatic residues from their cation- interaction with the tropine nitrogen. Finally, comparison of the 31 and 35 complexes with Ac-AChBP (parts C and E of Figure 5) showed

that the additional phenyl ring of 35, which is attached to the tropine nitrogen, causes an outward movement of Tyr53 to accommodate the ligand within the binding pocket. Docking of 31 and 35 in New Ac-AChBP Structures. The obtained crystal structures indicate an induced fit upon binding of 31 and 35. To evaluate the in silico docking procedure, we have docked both compounds back into their respective crystal structures. The overall orientation of 31 was reproduced (rmsd

Figure 5. Using the in silico screen on Ls-AChBP, we identified two different binding poses for 31 (A and B). The cocrystal structures of AcAChBP with 31 (C and D) and 35 (E and F) clearly show a different binding pose in which the ligands have displaced loop C by 5-6 Å. The most likely binding poses are depicted in parts C and E, since these orientations have more favorable cation- interactions with Trp145.

Figure 6. In silico mutations were made to understand the difference in binding affinity of the ligands for Ac-AChBP and the human nAChRs. (A) A M116F mutation (given in space-fill atom representation) was introduced in the Ac-AChBP cocrystal structure in complex with 31, and a clear clash occurred between the aromatic residue and the tricyclic moiety of the ligand. (B) The same crystal structure was used to make the M116Q mutant (also in space-fill atom representation). No clash was observed, but the residue and the ligand could make contacts that are less favorable in the case of Gln compared to Met.

of 1.745-3.586 Å). This placed the ligand nitrogen in proximity to Trp145 and allowed for cation- interactions to occur. However, the tricyclic moiety was docked in several distinct orientations with different dihedral angles around the ether bond. Compound 35 was positioned with the tropine moiety near Trp145, while the tricyclic group was within the aromatic cavity. This is a different pose than found in the crystal structure (rmsd of 7.431-7.877 Å). In Silico Mutation of Ac-AChBP To Resemble Human r4 2 and r7 nAChRs. Simple in silico mutations were made using the obtained crystal structures to understand the difference in affinity of 31 and 35 for Ac-AChBP and both human nAChRs. Sequence analysis revealed that for human R4 2 and R7 nAChRs, Phe and Gln, respectively, are present at the Met116 position in Ac-AChBP. An in silico Met116Phe mutant was made in the cocrystal structure of 31 and Ac-AChBP. This

indicated a clash between this aromatic residue and the tricyclic group of the ligands (Figure 6A). No clash was observed for the in silico Met116Gln mutant in the cocrystal structure of 31 and Ac-AChBP (Figure 6B). Electrophysiology. Compounds 31 and 35 induce an intermediate open conformation of loop C. To evaluate the functional consequences of these conformational changes, we tested the effects of these two compounds on receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Surprisingly, these ligands inhibited either the human R4 2 or R7 nAChRs with IC50 values in the micromolar range (parts A and B of Figure 7). Compounds 31 and 35 show comparable inhibition constants for both nAChRs with an IC50 value in the micromolar range, whereas these ligands lacked significant affinity in binding assays at the human R4 2 nAChR. Both compounds also inhibited the human 5HT3A receptor with similar IC50 values (data not shown), suggesting a common

(C-F) Determination of the concentration activation curves in the absence and presence of compounds 31 and 35. Typical currents evoked by a series of acetylcholine concentration in the presence of 31 and 35 are shown for R7 and R4 2 in parts C and D. The first trace (1280 µM acetylcholine for R7 and 30 µM acetylcholine for R4 2) was recorded in control conditions and used for normalization. Plot of the peak current as a function of the logarithm of the acetylcholine concentration yielded typical concentration activation curves (E, F). Note that, given their inverted U shape, R7 responses could not be fitted by the empirical Hill equation. Good fits were obtained for R4 2 with a dual Hill equation with high affinity coefficients of EC50 of 1 µM and nH of 1 and low affinity coefficients of EC50 of 30 µM and nH of 1.5 and a fraction of high versus low affinity of 0.28. Curves obtained in the presence of 0.2 µM 31 and 35 were fitted with the same parameters using a scaling factor of 0.81 and 0.15, respectively (n ) 6).

mechanism of blockade across this family of cationic ligand gated ion channels. To test this hypothesis further, acetylcholine concentration activation curves were measured at the R4 2 and R7 receptors in the absence or presence of 0.2 µM 31, 0.2 µM 35 (Figure 7C-F). The lack of displacement of the acetylcholine sensitivity and the insurmountable inhibition both suggest that 31 and 35 are acting as noncompetitive inhibitors probably by entering the pore and steric hindrance.

The observation that both compounds inhibit R4 2 and R7 nAChRs in a noncompetitive manner came as a surprise because these compounds were initially tested in 125I-Bgt displacement assays on human R7 nAChRs. In addition, they were cocrystallized at the binding pocket of Ac-AChBP, which is a structural homologue of the ligand-binding domain of nAChRs. These findings were further investigated by performing radioligand saturation experiments to determine whether a

Figure 8. Radioligand saturation experiments on human R7 nAChR show that 31 (A) significantly diminishes the Bmax value but leaves the Kd value unaffected. In contrast, 100 µM 35 (B) increases the Kd value and diminishes the Bmax. No effect was observed on radioligand saturation for 10 µM 35.

competitive component of ligand binding existed. A compound acting as a competitive inhibitor is expected to shift the Kd, whereas a noncompetitive inhibitor is expected to shift Bmax. We observed that 125I-Bgt saturation on the human R7 nAChR was affected by the presence of 31 and 35 but in a different way for each compound. Increasing amounts of 31 diminished Bmax significantly, whereas little effect was observed for the Kd value of 125I-Bgt (Figure 8A). This strongly suggests that 31 binds to an allosteric site, probably the ion channel pore. In contrast, 125I-Bgt saturation curves in the presence of 100 µM 35 showed both a diminished Bmax and an increased Kd value, indicative of both a noncompetitive and competitive component of antagonism (Figure 8B). This result suggests that 35 inhibits R7 nAChRs by dual binding to the extracellular ligand binding site and the ion channel pore. 3 H-epibatidine saturation curves for human R4 2 nAChRs were not affected by the presence of either 31 or 35. Both the Kd and the Bmax were unchanged, suggesting that inhibition of the R4 2 nAChR is caused purely by ion channel blockade. This was as expected, since both compounds did not show any affinity for R4 2 nAChR in displacement studies. In view of the close structural homology between 31 or 35 and carbamazepine, we tested the action of this antiepileptic drug for 125I-Bgt displacement on Ls-AChBP and human R7 nAChR and for [3H]epibatidine displacement on human R4 2 nAChR. No radioligand displacement was observed for carbamazepine in all three displacement assays. Discussion In silico screening procedures are commonly used to identify novel hit compounds for protein targets of which structural information has been obtained. In this study, we applied a successful in silico screening of a proprietary compound collection containing druglike molecules against the crystal structures of Ls-AChBP. The in silico screening was performed on three available crystal structures of Ls-AChBP, i.e., in complex with carbamylcholine, HEPES, and nicotine. The protein structures obtained from the Ls-AChBP complexes with HEPES and nicotine were very useful, as these templates yielded

high hit rates (81%); i.e., we selected 16 compounds for single point binding assays, and 13 compounds showed 125I-Bgt displacement from Ls-AChBP at nicotine-like affinity. Compared to the much lower hit rate of a set of randomly selected compounds, the results indicate a significant enrichment of the in silico screen. Interestingly, the carbamylcholine-bound Ls-AChBP structure failed to be a proper template for the in silico screening procedure. This structure has only a marginally lower resolution (2.5 Å) than the cocrystal structures of HEPES (2.1 Å) and nicotine (2.2 Å). It is noted that carbamylcholine could only be built in 3 of the 10 binding pockets of the two AChBP structures in the unit cell of the crystal structure. In comparison, nicotine could be built in all binding pockets and HEPES in three of the five binding pockets.12 This low occupancy of carbamylcholine might indicate a lower probability of the observed binding pose. We have compared the AChBP protein structures in complex with carbamylcholine and nicotine. The rmsd measured over all atoms of the entire protein was 1.164 Å, and over all atoms of the binding-pocket (Ls-AChBP: W53, L102, R104, L112, M114, W143, Y185, C187, C188, and Y192) the rmsd value was 0.648 Å. Indeed, the superposition of the two structures revealed that the structural differences are small. However, it should be kept in mind that scoring functions are highly sensitive toward small conformational differences between protein structures. Our results show that ideally the use of several crystal structures should be considered for in silico screening efforts to improve the outcome. In the past, AChBP has been cocrystallized with prototypical ligands that are known to bind to nAChRs. These include agonists (nicotine and epibatidine), partial agonists (lobeline), and antagonists such as cobratoxin and R-conotoxins. A consistent observation is that agonists stabilize loop C in a fully contracted state, whereas the peptide inhibitors stabilize loop C in a fully extended conformation. One exception is the nonpeptidic antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA), which stabilizes loop C in an intermediate conformation.8 Similarly, the ligands identified using our in silico screening stabilize loop C of AChBP in a conformation that is intermediate between the contracted and extended state observed in the crystal structures. This conformational state of AChBP is very similar to the "apo" structure of AChBP that was previously published by Hansen and colleagues.8 However, it is important to note that an ordered PEG molecule could be built into electron density of the binding pocket, and therefore, this crystal structure probably does not reflect a true apo state. Recently, we have been able to crystallize Ac-AChBP in the absence of ligand or buffer molecules and demonstrated that the apo state of Ac-AChBP (parts A and B of Figure 4) is characterized by the presence of ordered water molecules in the binding pocket. This observation agrees well with results from molecular dynamics simulation of AChBP, suggesting that water molecules occupy the binding pocket at five distinct sites.26 The cocrystal structures of AChBP with nicotine12 and conotoxin ImI7 have revealed that these water molecules can play an important role in forming hydrogen bonds between the ligand and residues of the binding site. More importantly, the apo state of Ac-AChBP is characterized by the lack of electron density at the tip of loop C despite the good resolution (1.9 Å) of the diffraction data (parts A and B of Figure 4). This indicates that this region of the protein is disordered in the crystal lattice and that this is most likely due to an intrinsic mobility of loop C. The movement of loop C is in line with several other experimental observations that loop C exerts fluctuating movements in the unliganded state of AChBPs and

nAChRs. For AChBP, the intrinsic flexibility of loop C has been demonstrated using tryptophan fluorescence27 and molecular dynamics simulation.26,27 Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry,28 Shi and colleagues demonstrated that loop C displays enhanced solvent exchange in the absence of ligand, suggesting that loop C exhibits rapid fluctuations in an open conformation. For nAChRs, targeted molecular dynamics simulation has demonstrated similar flexibility of loop C.29 We were interested in the functional characteristics of these compounds because they stabilize loop C in a conformation intermediate between the agonist- and antagonist-bound state of AChBP. Additionally, 35 causes an outward rotation of Tyr53 in the binding pocket, a residue that has recently been implicated in the desensitization of the R7 nAChR.30 Although distinct conformational states seem to be stabilized by the two compounds, our current knowledge of the receptor is insufficient to predict the functional outcomes of such differences. To address this issue further, we therefore examined the effects of 31 and 35 at receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The unexpected observation that both compounds significantly inhibit the R4 2 and R7 receptors suggested that additional mechanisms of ligand-receptor interaction could be present. As both 31 and 35 showed an insurmountable inhibition of acetylcholine-evoked responses of the R4 2 nAChR, we concluded that these compounds functionally act as noncompetitive inhibitors. Moreover, the magnitude of blockade probably occludes the plausible interaction that these compounds can have at the acetylcholine binding site. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that both compounds were found to inhibit in a similar manner the closely related cationic ligand gated channel 5HT3R. Interestingly, while this work was being finalized, Gumilar and Bouzat31 reported that well-known tricyclic antidepressants, i.e., imipramine (Figure 2), amitriptyline, and doxepin, inhibit Cys-loop receptors by acting through different mechanisms at open and closed conformational states. Patch-clamp recording studies using high conductance forms of R7-5HT3A chimeric receptors and high conductant 5HT3A receptors suggested that the tricyclic compounds have more than one site of action, namely, at the ion pore in the open state and at the extracellular domain in the closed state. The crystal structures presented here strongly support these recent insights and suggest that this extracellular site is actually the orthosteric binding site. The series of close analogues might be ideal molecular tools to probe the different binding sites in these advanced electrophysiological experiments. The obtained cocrystal structures allow us to speculate on the lack of affinity of 31 and 35 for the human R4 2 nAChR. Probably, the lack of affinity of both compounds for R4 2 nAChR is caused by Phe144 (counterpart Met116 Ac-AChBP), which clashes with the tricyclic moiety of the ligands. A Gln residue in the same position of the R7 nAChR binding pocket does not hinder binding of these ligands. The crystal structures have provided us with important clues for structure-based hit-optimization procedures. These structures clearly indicate that there is a cation- interaction present between Trp145 and the tropine moiety of the ligands. We expect that the tropine moiety of the ligands is crucial in binding to both AChBPs and nAChRs. In addition, Tables 1 and 2 show that the tropine containing ligands have significantly higher affinities than their piperidine containing analogues. The tropine functionality is also found in the R7 partial agonist tropisetron.32 The structures also show that there is significant conformational freedom in the orientation of the tricyclic moiety. Hydrophobic interactions between the dibenzosuberyl moiety and the binding

pocket are present, but there are no hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions that force directionality upon the tricyclic group. This finding is also illustrated by the docking of 31 and 35 into their crystal structures. The bulky tricyclic moiety forces loop C to move away from the binding pocket by steric clashes and might therefore rule out agonism, which is assumed to require a fully contracted conformation of loop C. Conclusion In summary, we have shown that AChBP is a good structural template for the identification of nAChR ligands in an in silico screening procedure. The HEPES and nicotine bound structures performed better than the carbamylcholine bound structure and were able to identify ligands with similar affinity as nicotine. This clearly shows that the use of several crystal structures should be considered to improve the hit-rate of the in silico screening. A subsequent similarity search of hit-compounds in our proprietary database was performed, and compounds with nicotine-like affinity and R7 nAChR selectivity were obtained. Two of these compounds were subsequently cocrystallized in Ac-AChBP. These complexes have provided interesting insights and new possibilities for future structure-based hit-optimization procedures to obtain selective nAChR ligands. Differences observed between ligand binding and functional assays highlight the need for combined experiments and further knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor. Materials and Methods
Proprietary Compound Collection. A proprietary compound library containing more than 5000 structurally diverse and druglike compounds was used in our in silico screening procedure. This database was obtained from a discontinued pharmaceutical company (personal gift of H. Timmerman) and was mainly targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in inflammation, allergy, and pain. This database also contained antidepressants and neuroleptics. This database was not developed specifically against ligand-gated ion channels, and it was not likely that the majority of the compounds had any affinity for our target protein. Database Preparation. The compound collection was stored in digital format, and three-dimensional structures were generated using MOE (version 2004.03, Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada). Counterions and solvents were filtered out, and protonation was set such that all acids and bases were charged. Partial atomic charges were calculated, and the molecules were energy-minimized in vacuo using the MMFF94x force field in MOE. Template Preparation. Three available Ls-AChBP crystal structures were used in the docking procedure, namely, Ls-AChBP in complex with carbamylcholine (PDB accession code 1uv6, 2.5 Å), HEPES (PDB accession code 1ux2, 2.1 Å), and nicotine (PDB accession code 1uw6, 2.2 Å). The ligand and water molecules were removed, and hydrogen atoms were added to the protein models. Partial atomic charges were calculated, and energy minimization was performed using the AMBER99 force field in MOE. The docking procedure was performed in only one binding pocket formed by adjacent subunits. In Silico Screening Procedure. Docking studies were performed using the GOLD docking program (version 2.0)21 and the GoldScore scoring function and default settings. For each ligand the binding pose with the highest score was determined, and all ligands were ranked according to their scores. The top-ranked 50 compounds were visually inspected to verify optimal binding in terms of hydrogen bonding directionality and steric complementarity of ligand and receptor. A diverse and high-ranked subset of ligands was selected for binding assays. Expression and Purification of AChBPs and nAChRs. AcAChBP and Ls-AChBP were expressed from baculovirus using the

pFastbac I vector in Sf9 insect cells and purified from medium as described.12 Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) expressing human R7 nAChRs were obtained from Christian Fuhrer (Department of Neurochemistry, Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich).25 Human R4 2 nAChRs were obtained using a transient transfection of HEK293t cells. To this end, HEK293t cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 50 IU/mL penicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycin in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Approximately 2 million cells were seeded in a 10 cm dish and cultured overnight before transfection. For transfection of each dish of cells, the transfection mixture was prepared in 0.6 mL of PBS and contained 0.3 µg of human R4 subunit plasmid, 2.7 µg of human 2 subunit plasmid, 3.0 µg of ric3, and 24 µL of 1 mg/mL 25 kDa linear polyethyleneimine (Polyscience, Inc.). The mixture was incubated for 10-15 min at room temperature before it was added into the monolayer cell culture loaded with 6 mL of fresh and prewarmed cell culture medium. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, collected as pellet by centrifuging, and stored at -80 °C until use. Radioligand Binding Assay on AChBPs. Competition binding assays were performed with His-tagged Ls-AChBP or Ac-AChBP in buffer (PBS, 20 mM Tris, 1 mg/mL BSA, pH 8.0) in a final assay volume of 100 µL. A constant concentration of [125I]Rbungarotoxin (125I-Bgt, GE Healthcare, specific activity of 182 Ci/mmol, 1 nM) or [3H]epibatidine (GE Healthcare, specific activity of 2 Ci/mmol, 3 nM) was used for Ls-AChBP or Ac-AChBP, respectively. The concentrations of radioligand were chosen at the Kd value for the target protein. The amounts of protein, 125I-Bgt, and [3H]epibatidine were chosen as such that we obtained a clear window in the displacement curve, sufficient amount of counts in our scintillation counting, and a radioligand depletion of less than 10%. Ligands were added together with TALON metal affinity resins (Clontech), which were prewashed with assay buffer and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature under continuous shaking. Bound radioligand was collected on 0.3% polyethyleneiminepretreated Unifilter-96 GF/C filters (Perkin-Elmer) using ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5. After the filters were dried, scintillation fluid (MicroScint, Perkin-Elmer) was added and the radioactivity was measured in a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter. In our single point assay on Ls-AChBP, 125I-Bgt displacement was measured in the presence of 100 µM ligand and the results were compared to 125I-Bgt displacement in the presence of 50 µM nicotine. The total 125I-Bgt binding in the absence of ligands was set at 100%. Radioligand Binding Assay on nAChRs. Binding assays for human R4 2 and R7 nAChRs were performed in a similar way as described for Ls-AChBP; however, no TALON metal affinity resins were added. The cells were homogenized immediately before use. In the R4 2 assay, [3H]epibatidine was used at a final concentration of 100 pM, and for the R7 assay 125I-Bgt was used at a concentration of 2 nM. Radioligand saturation experiments were performed with nicotine to determine nonspecific binding. The concentration of nicotine was 100 µM for the R4 2 nAChR and 1 mM for the R7 nAChR. Data Analysis. All radioligand binding data were evaluated by a nonlinear, least-squares curve fitting procedure using Graphpad Prism (version 4.01, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). All data are represented as the mean ( SEM from at least three independent experiments. Electrophysiology. Expression and electrophysiological recordings from nAChRs were carried out as described previously.33 Briefly, oocytes were injected intranuclearly with 2 ng of cDNA that encoded the human R4 2, R7 nAChR or 5HT3A receptors. All recordings were performed in OR2 medium that contained 82.5 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) adjusted with NaOH. Acetylcholine, 31, and 35 were dissolved in the solution just before use. To prevent contamination by the activation of calcium-dependent chloride channels, oocytes were

incubated for at least 3 h in the presence of the chelating agent 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetate-acetoxymethyl ester (100 µM). Unless indicated, all recordings were performed at -100 mV; data were digitized online and analyzed off-line using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Concentrationinhibition curves were fitted with a single equation in the form

y) 1+

1 x IC50

where y is the amplitude of current normalized versus the maximal response, x is the concentration of antagonist, and IC50 the halfinhibition. Concentration-activation curves were fitted with a single Hill equation for R7 and a dual Hill equation for R4 2 in the form

y ) Imax

(

a 1-a + nH1 1 + (EC50H/x) 1 + (EC50L/x)nH2

)

Imax is the maximal current amplitude normalized versus the amplitude of the reference test pulse, and x is the agonist concentration. EC50H, nH1, and a are respectively the half-effective concentration, the Hill coefficient, and the percentage of receptors in the high-affinity state, whereas EC50L and nH2 correspond to the half-effective concentration and the Hill coefficient in the lowaffinity state. Compound Synthesis and Validation. To validate the chemical structures of 31 and 35, a resynthesis was performed using a slightly modified procedure described by van der Stelt et al.34,35 Toluene was used instead of benzene in the synthesis of 5-chloro-10,11dihydro-5H-dibenzo[7]annulene (quantitative yield). In the preparation of dibenzheptropine, xylene was replaced for toluene and the reaction was performed at room temperature instead of under reflux conditions (63% isolated yield). Benzylation of dibenzhepnortropine was not performed with benzyl bromide but via a reductive amination procedure (60% isolated yield) as described by AbdelMagid et al.36 Analytical characterization confirmed the chemical structures.

Crystallography. Crystal screens for Ac-AChBP in complex with 31 and 35 were set up using nanoliter crystallization robotics37 (TTP LabTech, Hertfordshire, U.K.). Crystals for Ac-AChBP in complex with 31 were obtained with 100-150 mM CaCl2, 22-26% PEG400, and 100 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 in the crystallization buffer. For Ac-AChBP in complex with 35 crystallization conditions were 2 M Na formate and 0.1 M NaOAc at pH 4.5. For apo AcAChBP, crystallization conditions were 50 mM LiCl, 11-13% PEG6000, and 100 mM MES at pH 6.0. The "apo" crystals were grown in the presence of 300 µM ImII38 in an attempt to cocrystallize Ac-AChBP with ImII. However, this peptide binds with low affinity to Ac-AChBP (data not shown) and could not be localized in the electron density map. The conformational state is therefore referred to as "apo". Cryoprotection was achieved by adding PEG400 to the mother liquor for 31 cocrystals and glycerol for apo and 35 cocrystals. Crystals were flash-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data for Ac-AChBP in complex with 31 were collected at beamline BM-14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. Data were indexed and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK, and a first data set with

A second data set with diffraction data beyond 2.8 Å resolution was collected at beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source, Villigen Switzerland. Several technical measures were required to minimize spot overlaps along the 725 Å axis, including alignment of the crystal with the long cell axis along the rotation axis, reduction of the beam size, and focusing of the beam onto the detector. Data were processed with EVAL1541 to correct for residual spot overlaps. The model was further refined with REFMAC to Rwork ) 23.7% and Rfree ) 26.7%.
