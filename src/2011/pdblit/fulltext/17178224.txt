Abstract--A novel series of 2,6-diamino-3-acylpyridines were designed and synthesized as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. The representative compounds 2r and 11 showed potent CDK1 and CDK2 inhibitory activities and inhibited cellular proliferation in HeLa, HCT116, and A375 tumor cells. Ó 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), such as CDK1, CDK2, and CDK4, constitute a class of serine­threonine protein kinases that plays an important role in regulation of the cell cycle.1 Abnormal CDK control of the cell cycle has been strongly linked to the molecular pathology of cancer. CDKs have thus become attractive therapeutic targets for cancer therapy.2 The CDKs regulate cell cycle progression through complexes with their corresponding cyclin partners such as cyclin A, B, D, and E. For example, CDK1 associated with cyclin B regulates the cell cycle at the G2 and mitosis (cell division) phases. CDK1 inhibitors could block mitosis entry and arrest cell growth, and therefore may be useful therapeutic agents with potentially fewer side effects than conventional cytotoxic drugs targeting DNA synthesis. Several CDK inhibitors have entered clinical evaluation for the treatment of cancer.3 These include flavopiridol, 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), roscovitine (CYC202), and an aminothiazole compound (BMS387032).4 In our program to develop CDK inhibitors as anti-cancer agents, we recently discovered that acylsubstituted diaminotriazole derivatives such as RWJKeywords: Synthesis; Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; CDK inhibitor; Cell proliferation inhibitor. * Corresponding author.

387252 (1) are potent and selective CDK inhibitors and anti-proliferative agents.5 To investigate the role of the central heterocyclic core in the biological activity of the acyl-diaminotriazoles, we designed a new series of 3-acyl-2,6-diaminopyridines (2) as potential CDK inhibitors. Herein we report the synthesis of these novel compounds and their biological evaluation as inhibitors of CDK activity and tumor cell proliferation. Synthesis of 3-acyl-N6-aryl-2,6-diaminopyridines (2) unsubstituted at the 4-position is outlined in Scheme 1. The key steps involved ortho-metalation­acylation of an N,N-diprotected 2,6-diaminopyridine, followed by nucleophilic substitution on activated aryl or heteroaryl halides with the less sterically-hindered 6-amino group of the deprotected 3-acyl-2,6-diaminopyridine products (3). Specifically, ortho-metalation­acylation of 2,6-bis(pivaloylamino)pyridine (4)6 was achieved by first treating with n-butyl lithium at À78 °C in tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) containing (N,N,N 0 ,N 0 -tetramethyl)ethylenediamine (TMEDA), followed by coupling with an acyl chloride. Subsequent hydrolysis of the pivaloyl protecting groups with aqueous KOH afforded the 3-acyl2,6-diaminopyridines (3). Selective nucleophilic substitution of aryl iodides or bromides with the 6-amino group of 3 was generally performed under palladium-catalyzed conditions to give the desired compounds (2a­b, 2e, 2j­l, and 2y).

Cyano and nitro groups on 2b, 2e, and 2l were further derivatized. For example, hydrolysis of nitrile 2b with hydrochloric acid afforded amide 2c (23%) and acid 2d (27%). Catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds 2e and 2l gave the corresponding amine compounds 2f (90%) and 2m (46%). The amino group of 2f was selectively derivatized by acetyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, and benzenesulfonyl chloride to give 2g (82%), 2h (99%), and 2i (40%), respectively. Similarly, reductive amination of 2m with ammonium formate and reaction with benzenesulfonyl chloride afforded compounds 2n (14%) and 2o (73%), respectively. Because many potent CDK inhibitors contain a benzenesulfonamide group,5a,7,8 this moiety was incorporated to the 3-acyl-2,6-diaminopyridine scaffold. Aromatic nucleophilic substitution of para-iodo- or para-bromobenzenesulfonamide with (2,6-diamino-pyridin-3-yl)-(2,6-difluoro-phenyl)-methanone (3a) using the palladium-catalyzed conditions described above failed to give the amination product. Nevertheless, N,N-dialkyl para-iodobenzenesulfonamides, including N,N-dimethyl, N,N-diethyl, and N,N-dibenzyl derivatives,9 were successfully coupled with 3-acyl-2,6-diaminopyridines (3a­e) via the palladium-catalyzed amination protocol (Scheme 2). Stepwise deprotection of the benzyl groups of 2q to give free sulfonamide 2r was achieved in 21% combined yield by treatment with BBr3 in methylene chloride, followed by aqueous HI in acetic acid. To evaluate the effect of introducing an additional functional group on the scaffold, substitution at the 4-position of the core pyridine ring was investigated. The synthesis of 4-substituted diamino pyridine analogues is outlined in Scheme 3. Chelidamic acid (6) was first

converted to the corresponding di-n-butyl ester n-butyl ether (7) in the presence of excess iodobutane (14%). Diphenyl phosphorylazide (DPPA)-mediated double Curtius rearrangement10 using the diacid hydrolysis product of intermediate 7 proved to be problematic. An alternative stepwise procedure was then employed.11 Toward that end, the diester ether 7 was first converted to the corresponding dihydrazide using hydrazine. The dihydrazide was then carefully converted to diazide at low temperature using nitrous acid generated in situ. The resulting diazide was then transformed to the

BOC-protected diaminopyridine 8 by heating at reflux in anhydrous tert-butanol (15%). ortho-Metalation­ acylation at the 3-position of bis-Boc-protected 2,6-diaminopyridine 8 followed by deprotection afforded 3,4disubstituted diaminopyridine 3f (32% for two steps). Aromatic nucleophilic substitution of N,N-dimethylpara-iodobenzenesulfonamide with compound 3f gave compound 10 (30%). Similarly, palladium-catalyzed amination of N-Boc-para-iodobenzenesulfonamide12 with compound 3f followed by facile deprotection of the Boc group provided 11 (23%). Table 1 shows the structures and CDK1 inhibitory activities for the 3-acyl-2,6-diaminopyridine analogues. Examination of substitution on the 6-anilino group reveals that the ortho-position (compounds 2e­i) is the most sensitive site for maintaining CDK1 potency compared to the meta and para positions. The para-position is generally tolerant of the size and electronic characteristics of the substituent, except in the case of very large

groups like N,N-dibenzylaminosulfonyl (2q) and N,Ndiethylaminosulfonyl (2u and 2w). With 2,6-difuorobenzoyl at 3-position of the core pyridine ring, aminosulfonyl (2r) and N,N-dimethylaminosulfonyl groups (2p) in the para-position of the N6-phenyl ring produce the most potent CDK1 inhibitors. Also, replacement of the unsubstituted phenyl ring of 2a with a 2-pyridinyl group (2y) improves CDK1 potency two-fold. On the other hand, replacement of the 2,6-difluorobenzoyl substituent of compound 2p with 2-furoyl or 2-thienoyl groups (i.e., 2v or 2x) or removal of one or both fluorines (i.e., 2s or 2t) is detrimental to CDK1 potency. As shown by the CDK1 data for compounds 3f, 10, and 11, the 4-position at the pyridine core tolerates a lipophilic n-butoxy substituent, indicating that this could be another location to introduce additional functional groups to improve kinase inhibitory potency or ADME properties. Interestingly, the intermediate N6-unsubstituted 3-benzoyl-2,6-diaminopyridines (3a­c, 3f)

maintain modest CDK1 potency whereas CDK1 IC50 values for similar 2-furoyl (3d) and 2-thienoyl (3e) analogues could not be determined at the highest dose tested. In addition, the enhancement of CDK1 potency by 2,6-difluoro substituents was observed for the subset of compounds 2 having the aryl group at N-6; a similar trend was not seen in the subset of N6-unsubstituted intermediate compounds 3. Table 2 shows a comparison of CDK1 with CDK2 and other kinase inhibitory activities as well as in vitro antiproliferative activities in human tumor cells for three representative compounds (2p, 2r, and 11). These compounds are more potent against CDK2 than CDK1 and are inactive against VEGF-R2, HER2, and EGFR kinases at the highest concentration tested. Compounds 2r and 11 also proved to be active in vitro as anti-proliferatives in various human tumor cell lines, such as HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HCT116 (colon carcinoma), and A375 (melanoma). In summary, we have discovered a novel series of 3acyl-2,6-diaminopyridine derivatives that are effective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The key steps for the synthesis employed an ortho-metalation­acylation of diprotected 2,6-diaminopyridines and a selective palladium-catalyzed amination on activated aryl or heteroaryl halides using the intermediate 3-acyl-2,6-diaminopyridines. Representative compounds 2r and 11 showed potent CDK1 and CDK2 inhibitory activities and inhibited in vitro cellular proliferation in HeLa, HCT116, and A375 human tumor cell lines. Future progress on related series will be reported in due course. References and notes
