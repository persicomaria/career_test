Received 27th June 2007, Accepted 16th July 2007 First published as an Advance Article on the web 10th August 2007 DOI: 10.1039/b709681j The synthesis of an analogue of 6-epi-valienamine bearing an acetamido group and its characterisation as an inhibitor of b-N-acetylglucosaminidases are described. The compound is a good inhibitor of both human O-GlcNAcase and human b-hexosaminidase, as well as two bacterial b-N-acetylglucosaminidases. A 3-D structure of the complex of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron BtGH84 with the inhibitor shows the unsaturated ring is surprisingly distorted away from its favoured solution phase conformation and reveals potential for improved inhibitor potency.

Introduction
2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-b-D-glycopyranosides are naturally occurring glycosides found within many of the glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides that are present in an extremely wide variety of organisms, ranging from microbes to humans. Unsurprisingly, given their abundance in nature, there are several classes of enzymes comprising both hydrolases and lyases that have evolved to cleave glycosidic linkages involving this saccharide residue. Glycoside hydrolases are particularly abundant and have been classified into many different families on the basis of structural and primary sequence similarities. Members of each family have similar three-dimensional structures and use similar catalytic mechanisms. Interestingly though, just two main enzymecatalyzed hydrolytic mechanisms are known for cleaving the bglycosidic linkage of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-b-D-glycopyranosides. Examples of these two mechanistic classes include the exo-b-Nacetylglucosaminidases from family 3, and those from families 20 and 84 of the glycoside hydrolases, all of which are functionally related in that they catalyze the release of terminal 2-acetamido-2deoxy-b-D-glycopyranose residues from glycoconjugates.1­4 exo-bN-Acetylglucosaminidases from family 3 use a catalytic mechanism involving the formation and breakdown of a covalent glycosyl­enzyme intermediate.4 The enzymes from families 201,2 and, more recently, 845­7 of the glycoside hydrolases have been shown to differ in that they use a catalytic mechanism involving assistance from the 2-acetamido group of the substrate. As a result of the biological importance of these b-N-acetylglucosaminidases, the design of small molecule inhibitors2,5,8­11 has received considerable attention.10 2 -Methyl-a-D-glucopyrano-

[2,1-d]-D2 -thiazoline (NAG-thiazoline) 1 (Fig. 1) has been found to be a potent inhibitor of family 20 hexosaminidases2,3 and, more recently, family 84 O-GlcNAcases.5 Its poor inhibitory potency toward family 3 is consistent with this family of enzymes. O-(2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino-Nphenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) 2,12 the tetrahydroimidazopyridines, with the most important being 8-acetamido-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro6,7-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-acetic acid, gluco-nagstatin 3,13 and the triazoles, all prepared by Vasella et al., have all been shown to potently inhibit family 3 b-N-acetylglucosaminidases,14 family 20 human b-hexosaminidases9,13 and family 84 O-GlcNAcases.6,15,16,17 Some imino- and azasugars, as well as being good inhibitors of glucosidases, have also been found to be inhibitors of b-N-acetylglucosaminidases. The N-acetylamino analogues 4 and 5 of 1-deoxynojirimycin and isofagomine, respectively, are potent inhibitors of family 20 bhexosaminidases.18,19

To expand the repertoire of inhibitors of b-N-acetylglucosaminidases, we thought to modify the known inhibitor, epivalienamine 6, which is the C-6 epimer of valienamine.20 Valienamine is an essential core unit in many kinds of pseudooligosaccharidic a-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose,21 acarviosin,21 adiposin-222 and validoxylamine A.23 The valienamine core itself is also an inhibitor of some a-glucosidases.19 A rationale for the potency of valienamine against a-glucosidases is that it is thought to mimic both the charge and the ring distortion of the transition state. The 1 H 2 (2 H 3 conformation using the numbering as according to D-glucopyranose) conformation exhibited by valienamine resembles in some aspects both the 4 H 3 and 2,5 B conformations for the D-glucopyranose transition state, found for related hydrolases,24,25 which are the two likely transition state conformations for a-glucosidases (Fig. 1). The potency of valienamine stems from the crucially important double bond. "Dihydro" acarbose, a compound where the double bond has been saturated, is only a modestly good glucoamylase inhibitor (low micromolar K i ) compared to the very potent (picomolar K i ) acarbose which retains the double bond.26,27 On the other hand, little is known about the inhibitory potency of 6-epi-valienamine 6.28 Some N-alkyl analogues have been synthesised and have been found to be potent b-D-glucocerebrosidase inhibitors,29 and one, N-octyl-6-epi-valienamine, has potential as a therapeutic for Gaucher disease.30 We felt that owing to the success of 6-epi-valienamine analogues as potent inhibitors of b-glucocerebrosidases, an analogue of 6-epi-valienamine, where the hydroxyl group at C-1 was replaced with an acetamido group, as in 7, could yield a useful inhibitor scaffold for bN-acetylglucosaminidases. We therefore engaged in a rational synthesis of such a putative 6-epi-valienamine-based inhibitor.

Results and discussion
The methyl glycoside 8 was efficiently prepared in three steps from N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (Scheme 1).31 Removal of the benzylidene ring gave the diol 9. Selective iodination of the liberated primary hydroxyl group via a tosylate intermediate furnished the iodide 10. Following benzylation of the free hydroxyl group of 10, elimination of hydrogen iodide afforded the alkene 11.32 The alkene 11 could also be prepared via a reductive ring-opening of the benzylidene ring of 8, followed by sequential iodination and elimination (Scheme 1). Treatment of the alkene 11 with mercury(II) trifluoroacetate under Ferrier reaction conditions33 smoothly provided the presumed intermediate carbocycle (not shown), which was dehydrated to form the enone 12 (Scheme 2). Addition of the required exocyclic carbon to 12 is well precedented and we chose to use benzyloxymethylmagnesium chloride to facilitate the conversion. Interestingly, performing the Grignard reaction using 12 did not proceed to give the desired alcohol 13 but resulted in a Michael addition to give a ketone, assigned the structure 14. We propose that the amide moiety is first deprotonated, directing the Grignard reagent to the wrong carbon
 The ring conformations referred to in this paper are based on the IUPAC naming system for each individual compound. Since valienamine and its analogues discussed here bind in a manner that mimics the pyranose ring of the substrate, a more intuitive (although incorrect) numbering system using the glucopyranose ring system is given in brackets for convenient comparison.

and resulting in its axial addition. To circumvent this problem associated with the presence of the 2-acetamido moiety, we envisaged that a 2-azido group could instead be used. Returning to the diol 9, we obtained 15 after using hydrazine hydrate; treatment of 15 with trifluoromethanesulfonyl azide then afforded the azide 16 in good yield (Scheme 3). Iodination of 16 gave 17, which upon benzylation and elimination furnished the alkene 18 in good yield. Alkene 18 was then treated with mercury(II) trifluoroacetate to provide smoothly the intermediate carbocycle, which was dehydrated to form the enone 19. Gratifyingly, as we had predicted, treatment of the azide 19 with benzyloxymethylmagnesium chloride gave the desired alkene 20. Continuing on, alkene 20 was next treated with triphenylphosphine to reduce the azide to the corresponding amine, which was acetylated in situ to provide 21 (Scheme 4). Treatment of 21 with sodium azide and pure tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)34 yielded the azide 22. At this point, the required exchange of protecting groups went smoothly to give 23. The azide 23 was then subjected to triphenylphosphine to give the presumed intermediate amine which was treated in situ with tert-butyl dicarbonate to furnish the Boc-protected amine (not shown). Deacetylation followed by removal of the protecting group gave the desired compound 7 as its hydrochloride salt 24. We evaluated the inhibitor 7 against family 3 b-N-acetylglucosaminidase, NagZ from Vibrio cholerae (K i = 50 lM) and the family 20 human placental b-hexosaminidase (K i = 34 lM). Also, family 84 human O-GlcNAcase (K i = 6.2 lM) and a close bacterial homologue BtGH846 (K i = 26 lM) were assayed with this inhibitor. It is interesting that despite the close structural relationship of 6-epi-valienamine 6 and the 1-acetamido analogue 24, compound 24 is clearly much more potent. Indeed, Ogawa et al. saw no inhibition of b-glucocerebrosidase with 6-epi-valienamine This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2007

Asn339). Surprisingly, the unsaturated ring of 7 is distorted away from its favoured solution phase 1 H 6 (2 H 3 ) conformation toward a 2 S6 (1 S3 ) conformation in which the amine moiety is pseudo-axial ° and makes a 2.7 A hydrogen bond to the catalytic acid, Asp243. Such a conformation does not resemble the predicted transition state geometry but rather mimics those observed for the Michaelis complexes of retaining enzymes active on b-glycosides of the glucoseries (for example, ref. 35,36) and reflects in-line geometry for nucleophilic substitution at the anomeric centre: the O­C2­N2 (O­C1­N1) angle is 167 . Such distortion appears critical for establishing a powerful electrostatic interaction between the amine 7 and Asp 243.

6,29 which differs from the results described here using the 1-acetamido analogue. It is difficult to ascertain the basis for these differences. Therefore, to gain a more detailed understanding of the molecular basis for these apparent differences, we evaluated the interactions between 7 and a family 84 b-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The 3-D structure of BtGH84 (whose active centre residues are invariant with the human enzyme) was solved in complex with 7 by ° X-ray crystallography at a resolution of approximately 2 A. To our knowledge this is the first time that a crystal structure involving any 6-epi-valienamine analogue has been reported. The 3-D structure revealed clear and unambiguous electron density for 7 bound in the "-1" subsite of BtGH84 (Fig. 2). The acetamide 7 makes similar interactions to those previously observed for thiazoline complexes of the enzyme: notably a tight network of hydrogen bonds (O6 to NZ of Lys166 and the main chain carbonyl of Gly135, O5 and O in the hydroxymethyl group to Asp344 and the acetyl NH and carbonyl group to OD2 of Asp242 and ND2 of

Conclusions
We have devised a route that enables the rapid synthesis of an inhibitor of b-N-acetylglucosaminidases from a diverse range of glycoside hydrolase families. Also, this inhibitor scaffold has the potential to be used to create more potent and potentially selective inhibitors by elaborating the functional groups present within the inhibitor. The structural analysis of BtGH84 in complex with 7 given here should facilitate this development. Notably, although partial distortion away from the expected half-chair must come with a significant energetic penalty, the additional electrostatic interaction this permits clearly mitigates these costs. Furthermore, the pseudo-axial C2­N2 geometry suggests that augmentation of the inhibitor at the amine position should generate even more powerful inhibitors in which aglycone binding energy may be captured. Such inhibitors could be useful molecules for studying the cellular role of O-GlcNAc since they may have useful pharmacological properties.

General Experimental procedures have been given previously.37 Elemental analyses of all synthesized compounds used in enzyme assays were performed at the Simon Fraser University.

This material, presumably methyl 2-acetamido-3-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-a-D-glucopyranoside 9,31 was used in the next step without any further purification. Org. Biomol. Chem., 2007, 5, 3013­3019 | 3015

Kinetic analysis of b-N-acetylglucosaminidases O-GlcNAcase and Vibrio cholerae NagZ were overexpressed and purified just prior to use.5,14 Human placental b-hexosaminidase B was purchased from Sigma (lot 043K3783). Assays involving human b-hexosaminidase and B BtGH84 were carried out in triplicate at 37  C for 30 minutes by using a stopped assay procedure in which the enzymatic reactions (50 lL) were quenched by the addition of a four-fold excess (200 lL) of quenching buffer (200 mM glycine, pH 10.75). Assays using NagZ and human O-GlcNAcase were carried out using continuous based assays in which the enzymatic reactions (80 lL) were conducted at 25  C (NagZ) and 37  C (human O-GlcNAcase) as the enzymes were considerably more stable at these temperatures. Assays were initiated by the careful addition, via pipette, of enzyme, and in all cases the final pH of the resulting quenched solution was greater than 10. Time-dependent assays of NagZ, b-hexosaminidase B, O-GlcNAcase and BtGH84 revealed that the enzymes were stable and rates were linear in their respective buffers over the period of the assay: 50 mM NaH2 PO4 , 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, pH 6.5 for O-GlcNAcase and BtGH84, and 50 mM citrate, 100 mM

NaCl, 0.1% BSA, pH 4.25 for b-hexosaminidase B. The progress of the reaction at the end of 30 minutes for stopped assays was determined by measuring the amount of 4-nitrophenolate liberated as determined by UV measurements at 400 nm using a 96well plate (Sarstedt) and 96-well plate (Molecular Devices) reader. Reaction velocities for continuous based assays were determined by monitoring the liberation of 4-nitrophenolate using linear regression of the linear region of the reaction progress curve between the first and third minute. O-GlcNAcase and b-hexosaminidase B were used in the inhibition assays at a concentration (lg lL-1 ) of 0.0406 and 0.012, respectively, using 4-nitrophenyl-2-acetamido-2deoxy-b-D-glucopyranoside as the substrate at a concentration of 0.50 mM. The inhibitor was tested at seven concentrations ranging from three times to one-third K i . K i values were determined by linear regression of data from Dixon plots. Crystallization and structure solution of BtGH846 N-Terminally His6 -tagged BtGH84 was produced via isopropyl1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) induction (overnight) of pGH84-containing Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3; Novagen) cultures grown at 37  C to an OD600 = 0.6. BtGH84 was purified from cell free extracts via Ni-affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. Purified protein was concentrated to 5 mg mL-1 and exchanged into 20 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine1-ethanesulfonic acid) (pH 7.5) using a 10 kDa cut-off concentrator. BtGH84 crystals were grown using hanging drop vapour diffusion as for the native structure6 with N[(1S,2R,5R,6R)-2-amino-5,6-dihydroxy-4-hydroxymethyl-cyclohex-3-en-1-yl)acetamide hydrochloride 24 included at a concentration of 10 mM. X-Ray data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on ID 14­2 with 30% v/v glycerol used as the cryo-protectant. All Xray data were processed with MOSFLM from the CCP4 suite39 (Table 1). Structure solution was carried out using the molecular replacement technique as implemented in the CCP439 version of MOLREP using BtGH84 (PDB code 2CHO) as the search model. COOT40 was used to make manual corrections to the model with refinement using REFMAC.41 Solvent molecules were added using COOT and checked manually. Structural figures were
