Abstract Profilin II dimers bind the (GPS )Q peptide derived from VASP with an affinity of approximately 0.5 WM. The resulting profilin II-peptide complex overcomes the combined capacity of thymosin L4 and profilin II to inhibit actin nucleation and restores the extent of filament formation. We do not observe such an effect when barbed filament ends are capped. Neither can profilin I, in the presence of the peptide, promote actin polymerization during its early phase consistent with a lower affinity. Since a ProIU peptide-profilin II complex only partially restores actin polymerization, the glycine residues in the VASP peptide appear important. z 1999 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Certain types of cell movement are characterized by a rapid spatially de¢ned turnover of the micro¢lament system upon stimulation of cells. Actin desequestration and F-actin polymerization occur close to the cell membrane [1^3] or for instance in the comet tails formed by Listeria [4]. A variety of proteins are involved in this assembly and disassembly mechanism of actin, two of these key proteins are thymosin L4 and pro¢lin. Pro¢lin is a 12^15 kDa protein present in all eukaryotic cells at concentrations in a range of 5U103T to 5U103S M. Several ligands for pro¢lin were identi¢ed and can be classi¢ed into four di¡erent categories : actin [5], poly(L-proline) and poly(L-proline) containing sequences [6,7], L-K-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIPP ) [8,9] and a complex of proteins containing actin related proteins [10,11]. Families of proteins containing proline rich sequences are known. Representatives of the Ena/VASP family are the focal adhesion proteins VASP [12,13] and the mammalian homologue of

Ena, known as Mena [14,15]. The formin homology protein group consists of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bni1p and Bnr1p [16,17], Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc12p [18], cappuccino from Drosophila melanogaster [19,20], the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila protein diaphanous, p140mDia, [21^ 23], the Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene fus [20,24], the Aspergillus nidulans gene ¢gA [25] and the members of the vertebrate limb deformity complex [26]. Pro¢lin I was ¢rst identi¢ed as a G-actin sequestering agent [5]. However its function is more complex, it also lowers the steady state concentration of G-actin by the addition of pro¢lin I-ATP-G-actin complexes onto the barbed end of the Factin ¢lament [27^29]. It is believed this association is followed by ATP hydrolysis resulting in the release of pro¢lin I from the barbed end caused by a reduction in a¤nity of pro¢lin for the terminal subunits [30]. In the presence of thymosin L4, the main G-actin sequestering agent in cells, pro¢lin I promotes desequestration of G-actin from the thymosin L4G-actin pool [29]. When equilibrium between G- and F-actin is reached in vitro and thymosin L4 is present the desequestration activity of pro¢lin I has a much greater impact on actin polymerization than its sequestration activity. Under non-equilibrium conditions in vitro, pro¢lin I decelerates the nucleation step of actin polymerization. The phenomena described above obviously only take place when the barbed ¢lament ends are free. If the barbed ends of the F-actin ¢laments are capped (for instance by gelsolin), pro¢lin I displays a pure G-actin sequestering activity [28^30]. Mammalians have two pro¢lin isoforms, pro¢lin I and II [31^34]. Both form a 1:1 complex with G-actin and have a similar Kd value of approximately 0.5 WM [29,34]. In contrast, their a¤nity for their other ligands is quite di¡erent. Whereas pro¢lin I is preferentially associated with PIPP , pro¢lin II displays a higher a¤nity for poly(L-proline) rich sequences [34,35]. In this paper we studied the interaction of the pro¢lin isoforms with proline peptides derived from VASP using Biacore experiments and the e¡ect of pro¢lin II complexed to this peptide on the polymerization of actin using £uorimetric assays. The results of our Biacore experiments indicate that pro¢lin II dimerizes upon binding to the peptVASPwt peptide and that the a¤nity of this pro¢lin isoform for this peptide is much higher in comparison to the a¤nity of pro¢lin I. With our £uorimetric measurements we prove that the interaction of pro¢lin II with the peptVASPwt peptide overcomes the combined capacity of pro¢lin II and thymosin L4 to inhibit actin nucleation. Under the conditions used, this positive effect on actin polymerization is only observed for pro¢lin II and not for pro¢lin I. It is neither observed when the barbed

ends of the actin ¢lament are capped by gelsolin, in this case the pro¢lin II-peptVASPwt complex merely sequesters G-actin. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Protein preparation and peptide synthesis We puri¢ed skeletal muscle actin from rabbit muscle [36] and isolated it as calcium G-actin by Sephadex G200 chromatography [37] in G-bu¡er (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.7, 0.1 mM CaClP , 0.2 mM ATP, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.01% sodium azide). Cys-375 pyrene labeled actin was prepared as described previously by Brenner and Korn [38]. We isolated pro¢lin I and II from bovine spleen and brain respectively, as described previously [34,39,40]. We dialyzed pro¢lin against HBS bu¡er (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20, Pharmacia) for use in the Biacore experiments or against G-bu¡er for the £uorimetric assays. We prepared human plasma gelsolin following the procedure of Bryan [41]. We chemically synthesized thymosin L4 and poly(L-proline) peptides on a model 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA), and puri¢ed them using reversed phase HPLC. We used electrospray mass spectrometry to assess the mass and purity of the synthesized peptides. The proline peptides used in the £uorimetric assays had the following sequences: Ac.GPS GPS GPS GL (peptVASPwt) and Ac.GGPS GL (peptVASPs), both derived from the VASP sequence, and a mutant peptide, Ac.CGPIU GL (peptVASP(G/P)), in which the glycines are substituted by prolines. The analogous peptides used in the Biacore experiments, have an amino terminal cysteine. The latter amino acid was biotinylated with EZ-LinkIodoacetyl-LC-Biotin (Pierce). The biotinylated peptide was puri¢ed by reversed phase HPLC. 2.2. BIACORE experiments We determined the a¤nity and stoichiometry of the pro¢lin-peptide interaction using a BIACORE X (Pharmacia) with two £ow cells. We immobilized, by non-covalent capture, biotinylated peptide (the ligand) on a streptavidin coated sensor chip (Pharmacia) in the ¢rst £ow cell using a £ow of 5 Wl/min HBS bu¡er (Pharmacia). Di¡erent concentrations of pro¢lin (the analyte) were passed over the sensor chip at 20 Wl/min HBS bu¡er. We chose this £ow rate to exclude concentration e¡ects due to mass transport limitations and to minimize the bu¡er jump. The second £ow cell was used as the reference cell. The interaction between analyte and ligand was monitored as a kinetic curve (being the subtraction of the curves in £ow cells one and two) with an association, an equilibrium and a dissociation phase. We used the following formula to interpret the results of the Biacore kinetic curves mx  M aMl Wl WS RUmax is the maximum net increase of response units (RU), which can be obtained at equilibrium when monitoring the interaction of analyte with immobilized ligand on the sensor chip. RUI is the net increase of RUs in £ow cell one obtained at the end of the immobilization procedure. M is the molecular mass of the analyte (pro¢lin I or II, 14 970 Da and 14 943 Da, respectively), Ml is the molecular mass of the ligand (biotinylated forms of peptide, peptVASPwt: 2343 Da and peptVASPs: 1313 Da and peptVASP(G/P): 2424 Da), S is the number of binding sites for the interaction between analyte and ligand. From the Biacore kinetic curves, one can deduce the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction between analyte and ligand, Kd . It was proven theoretically that the Kd is that concentration of analyte needed to cause a half maximum net RU increase at equilibrium (RUmax/2). 2.3. Spectro£uorimetry In our £uorimetric assays, we studied the polymerization of actin (5.5% of the total actin concentration was pyrene labeled actin) in combination with various proteins as a function of time using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer (excitation and emission wavelength were set at 365 nm and 388 nm respectively). Each time we started the polymerization by adding F-bu¡er (G-bu¡er+0.1 M KCl+1 mM MgClP ) to the reaction mixture (see Figs. 2 and 4 for compositions). G-actin and thymosin L4 were pre-incubated at room temperature

The concentrations of pro¢lin II are in descending order, 44 WM, 30 WM, 20 WM, 12 WM, 8 WM, 6 WM, 4 WM, 2 WM, 1.5 WM, 1 WM, 0.5 WM, 0.35 WM and 0.25 WM.

When present together, poly(L-proline) peptides and pro¢lin were pre-incubated (at least 15 min) at room temperature before incubating with G-actin or with the G-actin-thymosin L4 mixture. The actin used in all the measurements was always pre-incubated at room temperature for an equal time so as to exclude temperature e¡ects between the di¡erent assays. To obtain capped actin nuclei we prepared gelsolin capped actin ¢laments which

Various proteins, with or without peptVASPwt, were then incubated with the actin sample in the same way as described above (see Fig. 5). Polymerization was started by adding F-bu¡er. Additionally, we carried out £uorimetric measurements at steady state. F-actin (7% pyrene labeled) was capped with gelsolin (1:330) and diluted into F-bu¡er alone or into F-bu¡er with 3 WM pro¢lin or into F-bu¡er with 3 WM pro¢lin and 3 WM of the peptVASPwt, to obtain a concentration range of actin from 0 WM to 6 WM. The samples were incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark to reach steady state. By measuring the pyrene £uorescence, the amount of unpolymerized actin was determined [29]. For another experiment at steady state we incubated 4 WM F-actin (5.5% pyrene labeled) capped with gelsolin (1:330), with a concentration range of the VASP peptide (0^100 WM ¢nal concentration) in the absence and in the presence of 3 WM pro¢lin II.

We monitored the polymerization of either 10 WM actin alone (5.5% pyrene labeled) (curve A, R), with 10 WM thymosin L4 (curve B, U), with 10 WM thymosin L4 and 5 WM pro¢lin II (curve C, E), with 10 WM thymosin L4, 5 WM pro¢lin II and 5 WM peptVASPwt (curve D, F), with 10 WM thymosin L4, 5 WM pro¢lin II and 5 WM of the short peptVASPs (curve E, W), or with 10 WM thymosin L4, 5 WM pro¢lin II and 5 WM of the mutant peptVASP(G/P) (curve F, +).

chip to a level of 87 response units (RU). We monitored the kinetics of the interactions with this peptide using a concentration range of pro¢lin II (0.25 WM^44 WM) in HBS bu¡er (Fig. 1A). The binding curves at the higher concentrations converge between 1000 and 1100 RU indicating the maximum level of response (RUmax) is approached and suggesting a stoichiometry of two pro¢lin II molecules for one peptVASPwt (RUmaxt = 1110 for S = 2, see Table 1). A plot of RU/pro¢lin concentration versus RU (at time 175 s) (Fig. 1C) also indicates the existence of multiple binding events as no linear curve can be drawn through the data points. The curve approaches the X-axis at 1051 RU, close to the theoretically expected value of RUmaxt for a stoichiometry of two to one. At present we cannot exclude there is a third binding event with lower a¤nity but we note that in that case RUmaxt would have to be 1664 RU. The global Kd value derived from the Biacore binding curves, i.e. that concentration yielding RUmax/2, is 0.5 WM. We performed the same analysis for pro¢lin I, we immobilized 60 RU of biotinylated peptVASPwt and we used a concentration range of 25^120 WM pro¢lin I (Fig. 1B). In this case the results are less unambiguous because of a rather low response even at high pro¢lin concentrations. Two scenarios are possible for interpreting the interaction curves (Table 1). If only a 1:1 complex can be formed, the theoretical RUmax is 384 RU. RUmax/2 is then reached at about 50 WM pro¢lin I, and this would be approximately the equilibrium dissociation constant. In contrast, if a 2:1 complex is formed, RUmaxt is 767 RU and RUmax/2 is not reached at 120 WM pro¢lin I. Consequently the Kd must then be higher and this result is more consistent with those of Petrella et al. [42], who determined a Kd of 500 WM for pro¢lin I when studying the interaction of pro¢lin I with a slightly shorter poly(L-proline) peptide, and with the crystal structure of pro¢lin I in complex with a proline peptide [43]. Thus, we can expect dimerization is also taking place but with a much higher equilibrium dissociation constant compared to pro¢lin II. The steepness of the curves is an indication of the fundamentally di¡erent reaction rates for the two pro¢lin isoforms. The association and dissociation rate constants of the interaction of peptVASPwt with pro¢lin I are much higher in comparison to the interaction with pro¢lin II. From the curves, one can in theory also derive the value of the association and dissociation rate of the interaction. However, in the current Biacore software (version 3.0), a model for describing the multiple or co-operative binding of two identical analytes to one ligand is not available. We also performed analogous Biacore experiments using other forms of biotinylated proline rich peptides and pro¢lin

Fig. 3. peptVASPwt does not alter the a¤nity of pro¢lin II for actin. A: F-actin was capped with gelsolin (gelsolin:actin ratio 1:330) and diluted into F-bu¡er to the concentration indicated on the X-axis. Curve A (R) represents the actin control curve, in curve B (E) actin was incubated with 3 WM pro¢lin II and in curve C (F) with 3 WM pro¢lin II and 3 WM peptVASPwt. B: 4 WM F-actin (5.5% pyrene labeled) was capped with 12 nM gelsolin (1:330) and incubated with peptVASPwt, in a concentration range from 0 WM to 100 WM, in the absence (curve A, a) or in the presence of 3 WM pro¢lin II (curve B, b).

II. We immobilized either a shorter peptide, peptVASPs, having only one GPS sequence instead of three repeats, or the peptVASP(G/P) peptide with the same length as the peptVASPwt but in which the glycine residues were substituted by prolines. We found a much lower a¤nity of pro¢lin II for the short peptide (Table 1). When a relatively high concentration of pro¢lin II was sent over the immobilized peptide only a small signal in comparison to the maximal possible response, was monitored. The peptide without glycine residues has a reasonably high a¤nity for pro¢lin II because 19 WM of pro¢lin II causes a signal close to the theoretical maximal response. 3.2. The interaction between pro¢lin II and the poly(L-proline) peptide of VASP overcomes the sequestering activity of thymosin L4 The observation that pro¢lin II dimerizes upon binding peptVASPwt combined with the e¡ect of pro¢lin I on the polymerization of actin with free barbed ends [29] urged us to study the e¡ect of the peptVASPwt-pro¢lin II complex on the polymerization of actin. First we focused on the polymerization of actin with free barbed ends. In Fig. 2, we followed the polymerization of 10 WM actin, either alone (curve A), in the presence of 10 WM thymosin L4 (curve B), with 5 WM pro¢lin II and 10 WM thymosin L4 (curve C) or with the pre-incubated mixture of 5 WM pro¢lin II and 5 WM peptVASPwt added to the G-actin-thymosin L4 mixture (curve D). As expected, we observed a reduced and decelerated actin polymerization in the presence of thymosin L4 due to the inhibition of both actin nucleation and polymerization by thymosin L4 (curve B). When pro¢lin II was added to this reaction mixture (curve C), a stronger inhibitory e¡ect was displayed because of the sequestering of G-actin by both proteins, consistent with the ¢ndings of Pantaloni and Carlier [28] who found similar e¡ects for pro¢lin I and thymosin L4. Surprisingly, pro¢lin II pre-incubated with peptVASPwt, at concentrations where a signi¢cant amount of complex is formed, fully restores actin polymerization in the presence of thymosin L4 (compare curves D and A with C). Remarkably also the

nucleation period seems to be a little bit shorter (Fig. 2, inset). Both these e¡ects cannot be attributed to an interaction between actin and the peptide because the polymerization curve of actin pre-incubated with peptVASPwt alone (curve not shown) coincides with the polymerization curve of actin alone. One could argue that the binding of the peptVASPwt to pro¢lin II prevents the latter from interacting with G-actin, hence pro¢lin II could no longer sequester G-actin and consequently actin polymerization would be less inhibited (compared to the reaction without peptide). Three lines of evidence indicate this is not the case. First, we observed that the polymerization curve of actin in the presence of pro¢lin II, thymosin L4 and the peptide (Fig. 2, curve D) reaches equilibrium at a higher value than the polymerization curve of

Fig. 4. Pro¢lin I, in the presence of peptVASPwt, does not restore on actin polymerization. We monitored the polymerization of either 10 WM actin alone (curve A, R), in the presence of 10 WM thymosin L4 and 5 WM pro¢lin I (curve B, a) or in the presence of 10 WM thymosin L4, 5 WM pro¢lin I and 5 WM peptVASPwt (curve C, b).

residues between the three proline stretches in the peptVASPwt may be important to mediate the e¡ect of pro¢lin II on actin polymerization. 3.3. Actin polymerization is not restored by pro¢lin I in the presence of peptVASPwt We performed a similar experiment using pro¢lin I (Fig. 4). As expected, polymerization of 10 WM actin in the presence of 5 WM pro¢lin I and 10 WM thymosin L4 is nearly completely abolished due to combined inhibition of nucleation of polymerization by pro¢lin I and thymosin L4 (curve B). However, in contrast to the results for pro¢lin II, we observe no restoration of actin polymerization in the presence of 5 WM peptVASPwt (curve C). We explain this by the lower a¤nity of this pro¢lin isoform for the peptide (as evidenced by the Biacore experiments, Fig. 1B and Table 1), under the experimental conditions used almost no peptide-pro¢lin I complexes are formed.
Fig. 5. The peptVASPwt-pro¢lin II complex does not promote polymerization when barbed ends are capped. We followed the polymerization of 10 WM actin capped with 40 nM gelsolin (1:250) (curve A, R), in the presence of 10 WM thymosin L4 and 5 WM pro¢lin II (curve B, E), and in the presence of 10 WM thymosin L4, 5 WM pro¢lin II and 5 WM peptVASPwt (curve C, F).

actin and thymosin L4 alone (Fig. 2, curve B). Second, we routinely observe a ternary complex between poly(L-proline), pro¢lin and actin during puri¢cation (see for instance Fig. 5 in [34]). Third, we performed a pro¢lin II sequestration assay (3 WM pro¢lin II, Fig. 3A) using capped actin ¢laments in the presence of 3 WM VASP peptide, a concentration where signi¢cant amounts of peptide-pro¢lin II complexes will be formed. If this results in less pro¢lin for sequestration of actin, or if the pro¢lin II in complex with the VASP peptide has a much reduced a¤nity for actin, this would shift the actin pro¢lin II peptide curve (curve C) towards the curve for actin alone (curve A). This is not what we observe, adding the VASP peptide to the reaction hardly shifts the curve, suggesting the various pro¢lin species in the di¡erent possible reactions have a similar a¤nity for actin. Moreover, we carried out a control experiment (Fig. 3B) in which a constant amount of capped F-actin ¢laments, 4 WM, with a constant amount of pro¢lin II, 3 WM, but with varying concentrations of the VASP peptide from 0 to 100 WM, were incubated to reach equilibrium. We observe a more or less constant value for the pyrene £uorescence of the di¡erent samples, suggesting that the a¤nity of pro¢lin II for actin does not change to a great extent when pro¢lin is in complex with the VASP peptide. We also investigated variants of peptVASPwt (Fig. 2). As already mentioned above, actin polymerization inhibited by thymosin L4 and pro¢lin II is restored when this peptide is present. When we performed a similar experiment with a shorter variant, with only one GPS repeat, peptVASPs (curve E), we observed no restoration of actin polymerization, likely because of the lower a¤nity and the lack of dimerization of pro¢lin II on this peptide (Table 1). In the case of the peptide with the glycine residues substituted by prolines, peptVASP(G/P) (curve F) we observe only partial restoration of actin polymerization, suggesting that the presence of glycine

3.4. Polymerization is not restored by the pro¢lin II-peptVASPwt complex when barbed ¢lament ends are capped In the model proposed by Pantaloni and Carlier [29], pro¢lin I-G-ATP-actin complexes participate in the polymerization by adding to free barbed ends of actin ¢laments. If pro¢lin II in complex with peptVASPwt follows a similar mechanism restoration of polymerization should not happen when barbed ends are not available. Therefore, we incubated gelsolin capped F-actin nuclei (10 WM actin, 40 nM gelsolin) and followed the polymerization of actin alone (Fig. 5, curve A), and of actin in the presence of 10 WM thymosin L4 and 5 WM of pro¢lin II without (curve B) or with (curve C) 5 WM peptVASPwt. We observe no di¡erence between the curve

Fig. 6. Model for the di¡erential regulation of actin polymerization by pro¢lin I and II. The activity of pro¢lin I (left) is under control of phospholipase C (PLC) [54]. Upon phosphorylation of the latter, pro¢lin I is released from the membrane and can bind G-actin. This pro¢lin-actin complex adds onto the barbed end of uncapped ¢laments, hence promoting the elongation step in the actin polymerization cycle. Pro¢lin II (right) dimerizes with a high a¤nity onto the proline rich stretches of proteins. These proteins may be located in anchor sites and linked to proteins in focal adhesion sites or in Listeria tails. The dimer of pro¢lin II on these proline stretches binds two actin monomers and promotes actin nucleation and actin elongation. Some of these proline rich proteins are known to bind directly to actin [60^62]. The barbed end of the actin ¢laments is indicated with (+).

with and without peptide, indicating pro¢lin II acts in both cases as a pure G-actin sequestering agent (in analogy with pro¢lin I [29]) and consequently the interaction no longer restores actin polymerization when the barbed ends are capped. 4. Discussion In this paper we studied the kinetic properties of the interaction of pro¢lin with a proline rich peptide derived from VASP and the e¡ect of this interaction on actin polymerization. Using Biacore experiments, we showed that pro¢lin II (and likely also pro¢lin I) forms dimers upon binding the wild-type VASP peptide, peptVASPwt. For the equilibrium dissociation constant of the interaction between pro¢lin II and peptVASPwt we derived a value of approximately 0.5 WM. For the interaction of pro¢lin I with this peptide, we estimate a Kd that will be higher than 120 WM, in agreement with previous reported values for the interaction of this pro¢lin isoform with slightly di¡erent peptides [42,44]. The observation that stable pro¢lin II-peptVASPwt complexes can be made, prompted us to investigate their e¡ect on actin polymerization. At high concentrations, pro¢lins are strong inhibitors of nucleation [29,45,46], an e¡ect that is augmented by thymosin L4. Consequently, little actin polymerization occurs (in the time frame monitored), when both these actin binding proteins are present. However, in the presence of peptVASPwt, the combined capacity of pro¢lin II and thymosin L4 to inhibit nucleation is completely abolished. This positive e¡ect depends on the formation of pro¢lin II-peptVASPwt complexes, because pro¢lin I, which has low a¤nity for this peptide, cannot restore the polymerization. Also, free barbed ends are required, as capping of ¢laments results in normal sequestering in the presence of pro¢lin II-peptVASPwt complexes. The latter experiment also indicates that the peptide does not change the a¤nity of pro¢lin for actin signi¢cantly, in agreement with data presented in Fig. 3 and with data that demonstrate formation of ternary complexes between actin, pro¢lin and poly(L-proline), [7,34,44,47]. From our polymerization data, it appears that the nucleation and perhaps also the elongation phases are a¡ected when peptVASPwt is present. The latter is consistent with the known role of pro¢lin in barbed end elongation as reported previously [27,29,46,48]. Thus, it appears that actin bound to pro¢lin II-peptVASPwt complexes can add more e¤ciently to plus ends of the ¢lament than actin-pro¢lin II complexes. In theory, the state of the nucleotide bound to G-actin could also in£uence the reaction, as pro¢lin is known to catalyze the exchange of ADP for ATP, [49,50]. We expect this e¡ect will be of minor in£uence in our experiments as we start with ATP-actin and no signi¢cant treadmilling occurs at the initial stages of polymerization. We sought to explain this enhanced polymerization mediated by the pro¢lin II-peptVASPwt complexes in a structural way. Therefore, we modeled a pro¢lin II dimer on the peptide using the published crystal structure of the pro¢lin I-L-ProIH complex [43]. We then ¢tted this model to the ribbon [51] or ¢lament model of actin [52], using the pro¢lin I-actin structure as a template [51]. In neither case do the structural models allow one to explain why the pro¢lin II-peptide complex results in more e¤cient polymerization. However, we note that the pro¢lin molecules in the pro¢lin I-L-ProIH complex do not

interact [43]. In contrast, our Biacore data are suggestive of co-operative binding of pro¢lin II to the peptVASPwt, necessitating pro¢lin II molecules to interact with each other. In addition, peptVASPwt may have a less rigid structure than LProIH due to the presence of the glycine residues. These appear to play a role in the bene¢cial e¡ect on actin polymerization because the peptide composed of 17 proline residues, peptVASP(G/P), only partially restores actin polymerization (Fig. 2A, curve F). However, the a¤nity of pro¢lin II for this peptide is slightly reduced. In contrast, pro¢lin I binds better to polyproline peptides of de¢ned length than to their counterparts containing glycines [42]. The importance of the glycine residues also follows from an observation by Kang et al. [53], who studied Listeria motility. They reported an inhibition of motility, due to competitive blocking of VASPbinding to pro¢lin, when they injected a GPS GPS GPS peptide into Listeria infected PtK2 cells but not when a pure poly(Lproline) peptide was used. The results presented in this paper combined with the already known di¡erent a¤nities of the di¡erent pro¢lin isoforms for PIPP and proline rich proteins [35] allow us to present a model (Fig. 6) that provides insight into the relation between actin based motility and the pro¢lin isoforms. Pro¢lin I is known to be preferentially associated with PIPP [35] and under this condition cannot bind actin nor promote actin polymerization [8]. Upon activation, phospholipase C is phosphorylated and hydrolyzes PIPP causing the release of pro¢lin I from membranes [54]. This pro¢lin isoform can then modulate the actin polymerization cycle [54] depending on the status of the plus end of the ¢lament. In contrast, pro¢lin II can be recruited by proteins containing proline stretches of su¤cient length [35,42,44] such as VASP and Mena, localized in focal adhesions [13,15] or in the tail of Listeria [15,55,56]. Since VASP and presumably also the other Ena/VASP family proteins are oligomeric [12,57], this may result locally in high concentrations of the dimeric form of pro¢lin II. This form may then help in more e¤cient nucleation of actin polymerization and elongation because our data show that rapid polymerization via the barbed end can be initiated by pro¢lin bound to proline rich sequences. This may co-operate with the modest nucleation activity of the Arp 2/3 complex as this complex operates at the opposite end of the ¢lament [58,59]. The e¡ect we observe may be more complex with the intact proteins as several of these, like VASP and WASP related proteins, have been shown also to bind directly to actin [60^62] and this will complicate kinetics. Proline rich proteins are under control of regulation, VASP is a target of cAMP and cGMP dependent kinases [63] and Mena binds SH3 domains [15]. WASP [64], Diaphanous [23] and Bni [16,17] are under control of small GTPases. Future experiments will show if any of these types of ligands regulate dimer formation of pro¢lin II coupled to enhanced polymerization.
