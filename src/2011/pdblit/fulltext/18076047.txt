ABSTRACT The role of the evolutionarily conserved residue Cys10 in Ochrobactrum anthropi glutathione transferase (OaGST) has been examined by replacing it with an alanine. A double mutant C10A/S11A was also prepared. The effect of the replacements on the coniugating and thiotransferase activities, and on the thermal and chemical stability of the enzyme was analyzed. Our data support the view that in OaGST, in contrast with other beta class GSTs that display significant differences in the glutathione-binding site, Cys10 is a key residue for glutathione coniugating activity. Furthermore, analysis of the OaGST-Cys10Ala structure, crystallized in the presence of glutathione, reveals that this mutation causes a switch between the high-affinity G-site and a low-affinity H-site where hydrophobic cosubstrates bind and where we observe the presence of an unexpected glutathione.

INTRODUCTION The super family of glutathione transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18) is composed of a wide group of multifunctional enzymes involved in the cellular detoxification of many endobiotic and xenobiotic compounds.1­3 The common feature of GSTs is to catalyze the nucleophilic attack of glutathione (GSH) on the electrophilic groups of a wide range of hydrophobic toxic compounds.1 GSTs are also capable of binding a large number of endogenous and exogenous compounds noncatalytically.1 GSTs are divided into at least three major families of proteins, namely cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal GSTs.1 The cytosolic GSTs (cGSTs) have been subgrouped into several divergent classes on the basis of their physical, chemical, immunological, and structural properties.1,2 Despite interclass sequence identity is often less than 20% all cGSTs adopt the same highly conserved fold.2,3 cGSTs are dimeric proteins with each subunit2,3 divided in two domains: a N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain and C-terminal all helical domain. The active site of cGSTs consists of two binding sites: the G-site where GSH binds and the H-site where hydrophobic electrophiles bind.2,3

OaGST C10A Mutant Structure and Activity

and is essential for the glutaredoxin-like reaction catalyzed by PmGST.16,17 However, Cys10 mutation to alanine had little or no effect on the CDNB-conjugating activity of both PmGST and the GST from Escherichia coli (EcGST).18,19 The structure of OaGST displays the canonical GST fold10 but shows some peculiarities in the G-site organization as compared to PmGST. Firstly, in OaGST, GSH and Cys10 are not covalently bound, a property that is also shared by the GST from Burkholderia xenovorans (BxGST).7 Furthermore, the G-site organization of OaGST is somewhat different from PmGST. In the structure of PmGST, together with Cys10, two more residues, namely Ser9 and His106, were found to be at hydrogen bond distance from the GSH thiolate, possibly providing an explanation for the maintenance of the conjugating activity in the PmGST Cys10Ala mutant. Conversely, in OaGST the topological position corresponding to the PmGST Ser9 is occupied by an alanine while His105 occupies a different position from its topologically equivalent His106 of PmGST, BxGST and EcGST and does not interact with GSH [Fig. 1(B)].10 These considerations prompted us to investigate if, in OaGST, Cys10 could play a prominent role in both the stabilization of the GSH thiolate and catalysis. The role of this residue as well as of the double mutation Cys10Ala-Ser11Ala in OaGST thermal and chemical stability has also been investigated. Our data indicate a significant effect of Cys10 in determining the affinity for GSH in the G-site. Analysis of the structure of OaGST-Cys10Ala, crystallized in the presence of GSH, revealed the absence of GSH in the G-site and instead highlighted the presence of a GSH molecule in the H-site, suggesting a switch between the high and low affinity sites in the mutated protein with respect to the wild-type.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In prokaryotes, several cGSTs are classified into the beta class.4­7 Bacterial cGSTs seem to be involved in the detoxification of antimicrobial drugs, they show redox and peroxidase activity and are involved in the protection against oxidative stress.8,9 Recently, we have determined the crystal structure of the cGST from Ochrobactrum anthropi (OaGST).10 O. anthropi is a Gram-negative bacillus isolated from soils contaminated by xenobiotic pollutants such as atrazine, phenol, and 4-chlorophenol.11,12 When O. anthropi is grown in the presence of toxic concentrations of these xenobiotics an increase in the expression of constitutively transcribed OaGST is observed pointing to the hypothesis that this enzyme serves in cellular detoxification processes.12­14 Beta class cGSTs are characterized by the presence of a cysteine in the G-site [Fig. 1(A)].5,7,10,16 Notably, this cysteine (Cys10) is covalently bound to GSH in the structure of the GST B1-1 from Proteus mirabilis (PmGST)
Site-directed mutagenesis, expression, and purification of wild-type and mutant OaGST enzymes

The DNA encoding OaGST in pBtac1 (pT-OaGST)6 was used as a template in the mutagenesis procedure. The following forward oligonucleotides were used for the mutations: C10A: 50 -CAAGGTCGGCGCTGCTTCGCTC GCACCC -30 ; C10A/S11A:50 -CAAGGTCGGCGCTGCTGC GCTCGCACCCCAC-30 . The QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones with the required mutation were confirmed by DNA sequencing.20 To induce gene transcription, Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM when Escherichia coli XL1-Blue strains, grown at 378C in LB (Luria-Bertani) medium21 and supplemented with tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich) and ampicillin (SigmaPROTEINS

Aldrich), reached an approximate OD550 of 0.4. The incubation time was prolonged for a further 16 h, switching the temperature to 258C. The bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice, and resuspended in 25 mM imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4 (buffer A), containing 2 mM dithiothreitol and disrupted by sonication in the cold. The particulate material was removed by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was subjected to chromatofocusing on a column (i.d. 1.0 cm, height 50 cm) containing polybuffer exchanger PBE 94 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with polybuffer 74 (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:8, pH 4.0 (flow rate 35 mL/h, fraction volume 2 mL). The peak of activity thus separated was concentrated and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer B), by ultrafiltration in an Amicon apparatus. Concentrated enzyme was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography with a DEAE column (i.d. 1.5 cm, height 11 cm; Bio-Rad Laboratories) equilibrated with buffer B. The enzyme was eluted with a 100 mL linear gradient of 0-0.6M KCl in buffer B (flow rate 0.5 mL/min, fraction volume 1 mL). The peak containing GST activity was pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA by ultrafiltration and subjected to further analyses. SDS/PAGE in discontinuous slab gel was performed by following the method of Laemmli.22 Protein concentration was determined by following the method of Bradford23 with g-globulin as standard.
Enzyme assays

NADPH, 0.5 mM GSH, 2 units of glutathione reductase, 3 mM cysteine S-sulfate (CysSO3), and catalytic amounts of wild-type or mutant OaGSTs. One unit of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidizes 1 mol of NADPH per min at 308C. Thermal stability measurements of enzymes (20 lM) were carried out by incubating the samples at each temperature for 15 min. At the end of the incubation, GSH and CDNB were added to the sample and the GST activity was determined.
Spectroscopic studies

Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Spex spectrofluorimeter (model Fluoromax) equipped with a thermostatically controlled sample holder at 258C. The enzyme samples (20 lM) were in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the proteins (excitation at 280 nm) were recorded in 1 nm wavelength increments and the signal for 1 s was acquired at each wavelength. Samples were scanned at least five times and then averaged. Spectra were corrected by subtraction of the corresponding spectra for blank samples.
Unfolding-refolding studies

GST activity with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) was assayed at 308C according to the methods of Habig and Jakoby.24 For the enzyme kinetic determinations, either CDNB or GSH was held constant at 1 and 5 mM, respectively, whilst the concentration of the other substrate was varied (0.1­5 mM for GSH and 0.1­1.6 mM for CDNB). Each initial velocity was measured at least in triplicate. The KaleidaGraph Software package (Synergy Software) was used to estimate the Michaelis constant (Km) and Vmax values by nonlinear regression analysis using the Michaelis-Menten equation. The dependence of kcat/Km on pH was determined by using the following buffers (0.1M) at the indicated pH values: Bis-Tris/HCl, from 5.0 to 7.0; and Tris/HCl, from 7.2 to 9.0. The reactions were carried out using saturating GSH (5 mM) and variable CDNB concentrations. The pKa values were obtained by fitting the data to the equation: log(kcat/Km) 5 log{C/(1 1 [H1]/Ka)} where C is the upper limit of kcat/Km at high pH.25 The thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (308C), using the glutathione reductase/NADPH-coupled assay.26 The assay mixture (1 mL final volume) contained: 140 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM

To study unfolding, all mutants (20 lM) as well as wild-type enzyme were first incubated for 30 min at 258C in 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT (buffer C) with 0­ 5M GdnHCl (guanidine hydrochloride). At the end of the incubation period, each sample was assayed for remaining GST activity in 1 mL of final volume but including the same concentration of GdnHCl as used in the incubation. Each sample was also followed by fluorescence emission spectra. In the refolding studies, the proteins were first incubated for 30 min at 258C in buffer C with 4M GdnHCl and than were rapidly diluted 100-fold in the same buffer C. The recovery of native conformation was monitored by enzyme activity and fluorescence kmax at different times.
Crystallography

OaGST-Cys10Ala was crystallized by the hanging drop vapour diffusion method using ammonium sulfate as a precipitating agent under the same conditions as the wild-type protein. 10 mM GSH was added to the protein solution prior to crystallization.10 Before freezing crystals were cryoprotected by pouring them in a solution identical to the mother liquor (2M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, and 200 mM lithium sulfate) plus 25% ° glycerol. Data were collected to 1.8 A at the ESRF synchrotron (Grenoble, France), beamline ID23-1, and were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK, respectively27 (Table I). OaGST-Cys10Ala crystal is

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OaGST Cys10 was mutated to alanine to eliminate its interaction with GSH. A double mutant C10A/S11A was also prepared. To test the overexpression of the mutants, total cellular extracts of induced E. coli XL1-Blue cells were examined by immunoblot analysis using an antiserum against OaGST.6 Mutant enzymes comigrated with the wild-type protein with comparable levels of expression (results not shown). C10A and C10A/S11A mutants did not bind to GSH-affinity Sepharose, and could not be purified by this standard method suggesting that the binding of GSH is impaired. We thus purified all mutants, as well as wild-type, by preparative isoelectrofocusing followed by anion-exchange chromatography as previously described.10 The electrophoretic mobilities and the apparent molecular masses of the two mutants were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme (results not shown). A single band for each form of enzyme was obtained indicating the absence of contaminating proteins. The specific activities and kinetic constants of the mutant enzymes compared with that of wild-type enzyme, determined with CDNB and GSH in the standard assay, are presented in Table II. The replacement of Cys10 with Ala has a great influence on the catalytic properties of the enzyme. A decrease in activity of $50% was observed for this mutant. In particular, C10A mutant showed a drastic increase in Km value for GSH of 105-fold as compared to the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of the C10A mutant was found to be significantly lower (23-fold) than that of the wild-type enzyme. This reduction is mainly caused by a significant loss of affinity for the GSH with respect to the wild-type. The mutation Cys10Ala also influences the binding of the second substrate, albeit less significantly. In fact, the kcat/Km for CDNB of the mutant enzyme was lowered by approximately twofold as compared to the wild-type. Significant results were also obtained with the double mutation C10A/S11A. A dramatic decrease in specific activity of $98% was observed. The effect of the double mutation is exerted both in the loss of affinity for GSH, as witnessed by a Km value 105-fold higher than in the wild type, but also in a dramatic decrease of the catalytic efficiency, by 291-fold, as compared to the wildtype enzyme. The effect of the double mutation on the kinetics for CDNB was also significant. Interestingly a positive effect on the affinity for CDNB is observed,

isomorphous to the wild-type crystal; therefore, wildtype OaGST coordinates, in the absence of any ligand, were initially used for rigid-body and restrained refinement using REFMAC5.28 At this point electron density maps were inspected and no electron density accountable for a GSH molecule was found at the G-site. A continuous stretch of positive electron density in the Fo-Fc map was instead observed at the H-site. A search for ligands, using GSH coordinates as a query within the program COOT,29 confirmed that this area of positive density was suitably shaped to host a GSH molecule that was therefore added to the model with 0.7 occupancy. Further refinement was performed alternating TLS and restrained refinement with REFMAC5 and maps visualization and coordinates manipulation with COOT. Two sulphate ions and 221 water molecules were also added to the model. Like in the wild-type protein, Tyr85 adopts two different conformations in the physiological dimer, obtained through crystallographic symmetry; here only one of the two conformations was clearly defined and was modelled with half occupancy. The final model was refined to a R-factor of 19.8% and a Rfree of 24.8% and was validated for proper stereochemistry with the program

with Km decreased by approximately sevenfold. However, a decrease in kcat/Km of $80% was obtained, due to the significant decrease of kcat. The pH dependence CDNB of kcat/Km for both mutants was also examined. The mutation of Cys10Ala caused a slight increase in pKa value (6.13 Æ 0.33) when compared with wild-type enzyme (5.96 Æ 0.19). Instead, a significantly higher pKa value of 6.65 Æ 0.25 was observed for the double mutant. Taken together, these data show that Cys10 plays a direct role in conferring catalytic competence to OaGST due to its more important contribution to the binding of GSH, as compared to other bacterial GSTs. However Cys10 is not exclusively involved in the activation and/or stabilization of the GSH thiol. In a previous report it was observed that PmGST is able to perform a glutathionedependent thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity and that the cysteine residue plays a key role in the reaction.17 As a result, PmGST was proposed to be a snapshot in the transition, occurred during evolution, from the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity to the conjugating activity for the GST superfamily.17 OaGST also is able to perform such reaction using cysteine S-sulfate as substrate with a specific activity of about 0.4 U/mg. Furthermore, Cys10 is an essential residue in this redox activity. In fact, its replacement by alanine abolishes this enzymatic activity completely.The effects of the mutations on the structural stability of the enzyme were analysed following the enzymatic activity as a function of temperature (Fig. 2). The curve of the C10A mutant is coincident with that of the wild-type enzyme, retaining 80% of initial activity at $508C. In contrast, the C10A/S11A mutant is more thermo-labile. In fact, after incubation at 508C, the double mutant was completely inactivated. These results suggest that the loss in activity caused by replacing Cys10 is mainly due to the decreased affinity for GSH while the Ser11Ala mutation adds to this effect a more prominent effect on the structural stability of the enzyme as we had previously shown.10 The unfolding transition of OaGST and its mutants was also followed by measuring the loss of enzyme activity in the presence of increasing amounts of GdnHCl. Both mutants were less stable than wild-type enzyme

[Fig. 3(A­C)]. At the concentration of 0.5M, both mutants completely lost their activity while the wild-type enzyme still retained 30% of its functionality. The effect of GdnHCl was also monitored by following the variation in the maximum fluorescence-emission wavelength [Fig. 3(A­C)]. In the native state, wild-type, C10A and C10A/S11A mutants had emission maxima at 339 nm (data not shown). The addition of increasing concentrations of denaturant caused, at equilibrium, a red shift of the emission spectra of $11 nm for all forms (not shown). The maximum of kmax displacement occurred at 3M GdnHCl, indicating the complete exposure of the tryptophan residues (at positions 146 and

In BxGST both the G-site and the H-site are occupied by GSH molecules (shown in blue). The H-site GSH of OaGSTCys10Ala is shown in red and it is slightly shifted toward the G-site with respect to the BxGST corresponding one.

trary, double mutant displayed lower refolding yield with 31% of activity recovered 60 min after dilution. By combining these thermal and chemical unfolding-refolding data, we suggest that Cys10 does not play a prominent role in the overall structural stability of the enzyme but, nevertheless, it exerts a local role in the plasticity of the G-site, which is responsible for the faster loss of activity in the presence of low concentrations of GdnHCl and the reduced recover of activity when the denaturant is diluted. When the Ser11Ala mutation is added to the Cys10Ala mutation, a more drastic behaviour is observed that is mainly due to the global effect of this latter mutation on the overall stability of the enzyme.10 The OaGST-Cys10Ala protein was crystallized after addition of 10 mM GSH to the protein solution. The refined structure reveals no significant overall conformational changes with respect to the wild-type, with a rms ° deviation among superimposed C-alphas of 0.229 A. Interestingly, after inspection of the electron density maps, we did not observe any continuous stretch of electron density in the G-site, which is instead water-filled. This is consistent with the drastic increase in Km for the mutant by 105-fold as compared to the wild-type. Unexpectedly, we did observe additional electron density in the positive Fo-Fc map, accountable for a GSH, located in the H-site. This is remarkable, since we had previously crystallized the wild-type protein under the same experimental conditions and no extra density was found at this site.10 An automated search for protein ligands, using GSH coordinates as a query, within the program COOT,29 confirmed that this area of extra density could

account for a GSH molecule. We thus modeled and refined a GSH molecule with an average B-factor of $38 ° A2 and 0.7 occupancy. The GSH is accommodated in the H-site where it establishes hydrophobic interactions with Trp164 and Phe112. Additionally, the glycyl moiety is engaged in hydrogen bond interactions with His105 and Ser109 [Fig. 4(A)]. As a consequence, both His105 and Ser109 side chains adopt a different conformation as compared to the wild-type. Other minor side chain movements include those of Ser102 in the G-site, which due to the lack of an interacting GSH is free to move and adopts two different conformations, and a slight shift in the position of Phe112 in the H-site to accommodate the GSH ligand. The presence of a second low affinity binding site for GSH had already been postulated by functional studies on PmGST and recently directly shown in the crystal structure of BxGST.7,17 Here, two GSH molecules were shown to bind the protein, one in the G-site and one in the H-site. The position of the H-site GSH in OaGSTCys10Ala is, however, different from the corresponding one in BxGST [Fig. 4(B)]. In particular, here the GSH is slightly shifted toward the G-site with respect to the BxGST H-site GSH and its cysteinyl sulfur atom occupies the same position it has in the canonical G-site conformation. As a consequence in OaGST-Cys10Ala, the GSH occupies an intermediate position with respect to the positions occupied by the two GSH molecules in the BxGST structure [Fig. 4(B)]. This is probably due to the absence in OaGST-Cys10Ala of a GSH in the G-site and

highlights the mainly aspecific nature of GSH binding to the H-site. In conclusion, our data suggest that in OaGST, mutation of a single residue, Cys10, is responsible for a significant loss in catalytic efficiency and, surprisingly, is sufficient to switch the affinity for GSH between the high-affinity G-site and the low-affinity H-site.
