Complement receptor type 2 (CR2, CD21) is a cell surface protein that links the innate and adaptive immune response during the activation of B cells. The extracellular portion of CR2 comprises 15 or 16 short complement regulator (SCR) domains, for which the overall arrangement in solution is unknown. This was determined by constrained scattering and ultracentrifugation modelling. The radius of gyration of CR2 SCR 1-15 was determined to be 11.5 nm by both X-ray and neutron scattering, and that of its cross-section was 1.8 nm. The distance distribution function P(r) showed that the overall length of CR2 SCR 1-15 was 38 nm. Sedimentation equilibrium curve fits gave a mean molecular weight of 135,000 (±13,000) Da, in agreement with a fully glycosylated structure. Velocity experiments using the g*(s) derivative method gave a sedimentation coefficient of 4.2 (±0.1) S. In order to construct a model of CR2 SCR 1-15 for constrained fitting, homology models for the 15 SCR domains were combined with randomised linker peptides generated by molecular dynamics simulations. Using an automated procedure, the analysis of 15,000 possible CR2 SCR 1-15 models showed that only those models in which the 15 SCR domains were flexible but partially folded back accounted for the scattering and sedimentation data. The best-fit CR2 models provided a visual explanation for the versatile interaction of CR2 with four ligands C3d, CD23, gp350 and IFN-. The flexible location of CR2 SCR 1-2 is likely to facilitate interactions of C3d­antigen complexes with the B cell receptor.

Introduction
Complement receptor type 2 (CR2, CD21) is a type I membrane glycoprotein. It is principally found on mature B cells, follicular dendritic cells, epithelial cells, and some T cells. The complement C3 cleavage products iC3b, C3dg and C3d, all covalently attached to antigen, serve as the major ligands for CR2. On mature B lymphocytes (but not on early or

late B cells), CR2 plays a role in the activation of the B cell and the generation of a normal immune response by acting as an interface between the innate and adaptive humoral immune systems. The CR2/CD19 signalling complex is brought into proximity with the B cell receptor (BCR) through a C3d-antigen bridge. 1 CR2 also has a role in generation of immunologic memory, Ig class switching and the regulation of homotypic and heterotypic adhesion.2­5 CR2 is a member of the regulators of complement activity (RCA) family, distinguished by the presence of short complement regulator (SCR) domains (also known as short consensus repeat, Sushi or complement control protein domains). This family includes the C3 and C4-binding proteins of the complement system.6,7 CR2 is formed of 15 or 16 SCR domains depending on alternative splicing (Figure 1),8,9 a transmembrane region and a short

Figure 1. A schematic diagram of CR2 showing the 15 SCR domains. The position of the 16th domain in the alternatively spliced form of CR2 is indicated by the broken ellipse labelled 10a. The long homologous repeats (LHR) are indicated in bracketed ranges, in which SCR 15 does not fit the pattern. The binding sites for four sets of ligands are shown by horizontal arrows. The number of residues in each of the 14 inter-SCR linkers is shown between each pair of domains. The 11 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites are marked by  symbols. Underneath, the 15 SCR sequences of CR2 are aligned. Each SCR sequence is numbered at its start and end, counting from residue 1 at the start of the signal peptide (not included) (SWISSPROT entry P20023). The sequence from residue 972 onwards is not included. Conserved Cys and Trp residues are highlighted in red, and the linker sequences are highlighted in green. The N-linked glycosylation sites are underlined.

cytoplasmic tail. It is possible from sequence and genomic analyses that the 15 CR2 SCR domains exist as four long homologous repeats (Figure 1),9­11 although the sequence identities are not as marked as the long homologous repeats found in complement receptor type 1 (CR1, CD35).12 Mutation studies showed that both the SCR 1-2 domains are required for the binding of C3 cleavage fragments (C3d, C3dg, and iC3b) and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) coat glycoprotein gp350/220.13,14 CR2 SCR 12 also contains binding sites for the low-affinity IgE receptor, CD23,15 and interferon alpha (IFN-).16 Importantly a further binding site for CD23 occurs in the SCR 5-8 domains that is dependent upon the N-linked oligosaccharides (Figure 1).17 A molecular understanding of CR2 activity requires both structural and functional data on the 15 SCR domains. SCR 1 and 2 are joined by an eightresidue linker. The crystal structure of CR2 SCR 1-2, both alone and in complex with C3d, showed the two SCR domains to be in a closed V-shape.18,19 In contrast, the solution structure of CR2 SCR 1-2 both free and complexed with C3d is a much more open V-shape. This difference showed a high degree of flexibility in the linker between SCR 1 and 2, which is able to adopt a wide range of different conformations.20 Five other inter-SCR linkers in CR2 are also seven or eight residues in length, in contrast to the median length of three to four residues seen in

many other SCR containing proteins.21­23 Crystal structures for four-SCR or five-SCR domain proteins such as vaccinia coat protein and 2-glycoprotein I show generally linear structures with minor bends.22,23 Accordingly the effect of the longer linkers on the overall structure of CR2 is of great interest. Hydrodynamic data and electron microscopy on recombinant CR2 SCR 1-16 showed extended conformations, but with a variable interSCR orientation.24 The comparison of the interaction of CR2 SCR 1-2 and SCR 1-15 for its C3dg ligand has been studied by surface plasmon resonance studies to show that these are dependent on the number of SCR domains; however, the molecular basis for this is unknown.25,26 The clarification of how CR2 SCR 1-15 interacts with membrane-bound IgM through interactions with C3 fragments requires a molecular structure for the intact protein. Small angle scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation are a powerful combination of techniques, which, in conjunction with constrained modelling techniques, will give a medium resolution structure in solution. Using this approach, we have determined molecular structures for other SCR proteins such as the 20 SCR domains in Factor H (FH)27 and the five SCR domains in rodent Crry.21 FH was found to possess a foldedback solution structure, while Crry was an extended rod-like structure. Here, the application of our

1134 method to CR2 shows that, unlike FH, CR2 is on average semi-extended in solution. We show that the CR2 structure is flexible. Such a structure is apparently able to fold back, and this would facilitate ligand interactions occurring across SCR domains that are separated in the CR2 sequence. The comparison of the dimensions of CR2 SCR 1-15 with other SCR proteins and the proteins known to be colocated with CR2 on cell surfaces enables us to visualize the way in which CR2 interacts with its ligands, in particular with antigen­C3d complexes that are bound to the B cell receptor.

Results and Discussion
X-ray scattering data for CR2 SCR 1-15 The preparations of CR2 SCR 1-15 for scattering and ultracentrifugation were subjected to sizeexclusion chromatography before use. Initial work indicated a tendency for sample aggregation and degradation, and this was attributable to the large size of the protein and the long lengths of six CR2 linker peptides, which may make this protein susceptible to cleavage. The homogenous peak obtained from size exclusion chromatography was used for final data collection and showed a single

clean band when analysed by SDS­PAGE. X-ray scattering experiments were carried out on CR2 SCR 1-15 between 0.5 and 2.5 mg/ml in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS; Materials and Methods). Guinier radius of gyration RG fits were linear in an appropriate Q.RG range up to 1.6, where Q = 4 sin / (2 = scattering angle;  = wavelength). As minor X-ray induced radiation damage effects were visible during the ten time frames of data acquisition, only the first time frame was used for Guinier analyses, in which this effect was minimal. The mean X-ray RG value of CR2 SCR 1-15 is 11.5 (±0.9) nm (Figure 2(a)). The anisotropy ratio is RG/RO, where RO is the RG of the sphere of volume equal to that of the hydrated protein. For typical globular proteins, RG/RO is approximately 1.28.28 For CR2 SCR 1-15, RG/RO was determined as 4.1 to show that this is highly elongated. The cross-sectional radius of gyration RXS value monitors the shorter axes of an elongated macromolecule. In the case of SCR-containing proteins, this parameter is a monitor of the averaged shortrange and long-range orientation between adjacent SCR domains.27 Unlike the X-ray scattering curve for FH, in which two linear regions of fit were observed, only one fit range was seen for CR2 SCR 1-15. From this, the mean X-ray RXS value of CR2 SCR 1-15 was determined as 1.8(±0.1) nm (Figure

The filled circles correspond to the data points used to obtain RG or RXS values and the straight lines correspond to the best fit through these points.

1135 not fully extended. One way of achieving this notional 30% reduction in length to 38 nm in CR2 SCR 1-15 is to postulate that the 19 individual pairs of SCR domains within CR2 have a V-shaped structure with an inter-SCR angle of 90°. This arrangement results in a length of 38 nm. While such a V-shaped arrangement is unlikely (see the third modelling search below), this inter-SCR angle of 90° is close to the range of 63° to 121° determined in previous best-fit CR2 SCR 1-2 modelling.20 It is also noteworthy that the observed L value for FH is 40 nm, to be compared with a maximum possible length of 73 nm for a fully extended FH model. This means that FH demonstrates a notional length reduction of 45%, indicating that the solution structure of FH is comparatively more compact than that of CR2 SCR 1-15. Neutron scattering data for CR2 SCR 1-15 Neutron scattering was successfully performed on CR2 SCR 1-15 at 1.5 mg/ml in PBS buffer in 2H2O (Materials and Methods). In general, CR2 SCR 1-15 was found to aggregate in 2H2O. This aggregation is most likely to be the consequence of its 13% glycosylation content, which will be less effectively hydrated in 2 H2O buffers in which hydrogen bonding between the glycoprotein and the solvent is weaker. From this neutron measurement, the RG value was determined to be 11.5(±0.5) nm, which is in agreement with the X-ray value of 11.5(±0.9) nm. The Guinier RXS value was determined to be 1.8(±0.1) nm using the same Q range in the X-ray analyses, which is also consistent with the X-ray value. The neutron P(r) analysis gave an M value of 6.5 nm and a maximum dimension L of 38 nm (not shown), both of which agree with the X-ray analyses. As neutron scattering is unaffected by radiation damage, the neutron data show that the Xray analyses are not significantly affected by radiation damage effects. Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity data for CR2 SCR 1-15 In order to confirm the monomeric state of CR2 SCR 1-15 and its molecular weight, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at four concentrations between 0.5 mg/ml and 1.8 mg/ml in PBS buffer and five rotor speeds (Materials and Methods). Even though trace amounts of aggregates were detectable by the appearance of the residuals, the absorbance and interference data gave an average molecular weight of 135,000(±13,000) Da (Figure 4). Glycoproteins expressed by baculovirus are assumed to contain only high mannose-type oligosaccharides.29,30 The CR2 SCR 1-15 sequence between Ile21 and Arg971 (Figure 1(b)) resulted in a calculated molecular weight of 104,000 Da for the protein. If 11 high-mannose oligosaccharide chains (Man7GlcNAc2) are included, this gives a calculated molecular weight of 121,000 Da. As the experimental and calculated values are in reasonable agreement

2(c)). This RXS value is comparable to the second RXS value of 1.7(±0.1) nm for FH (20 SCR domains), and the RXS values of 1.5(±0.1) nm for rat Crry (five SCR domains), and 1.3(±0.1) nm for mouse Crry-Ig (2 × 5 SCR domains).21,27 The absence of the first RXS value corresponding to that for FH indicates that the overall arrangement of 15 SCR domains in CR2 SCR 1-15 is significantly different from that for FH. The good agreement with the RXS values for FH and the Crry proteins indicates that the averaged SCR orientation between pairs of SCR domains is similar in all three proteins. The indirect transformation of the scattering data I (Q) in reciprocal space into real space gives the distance distribution function P(r). This represents all the distance vectors between pairs of atoms within CR2 SCR 1-15 in real space. The P(r) function gives an independent calculation of the RG and I(0) values that is based on the full scattering curve in the Q range between 0.08 nm-1 to 2.07 nm-1, and gives the maximum dimension of CR2 SCR 1-15, denoted L. The P(r) curve calculations were not straightforward to achieve, this being attributed to its highly extended solution structure. Calculations based on the best four I(Q) curves showed a maximum M1 at an r value of 6 nm. That shown in Figure 3 has an M1 value at 6.1 nm and an L value of 38 nm. There were indications of a second peak M2 at 22 nm. The presence of M2 suggests a long-range structure in CR2, which might arise through folding back of the 15 SCR domains. The RG value of 11.6 nm calculated from this P(r) curve was in good agreement with that calculated from the Guinier fits. In addition, the L value of 38 nm is in good agreement with the length of 38.6 nm estimated for CR2 SCR 1-16 by electron microscopy.24 The averaged length of a single SCR domain is 3.6 (±0.2) nm.21 If CR2 SCR 1-15 were to be fully extended in solution, the 15 domains would result in a length of at least 54 nm if the linker lengths are not included. This difference shows that the averaged solution structure for CR2 SCR 1-15 is

The maximum of the P(r) curve is denoted by M1, the most frequently occurring distance within the protein, and L denotes its maximum dimension. The M1 value is 6.1 nm and the L value is 38 nm. A second feature M2 at r = 22 nm is discussed in the text.

(a) and (b) Best-fit curves for CR2 SCR 1-15 at a rotor speed of 14,000 rpm using absorbance optics. The concentrations are 1.0 mg/ml and 1.4 mg/ ml, respectively. The fits assumed a single species and gave molecular masses of 127,000 and 133,000 Da, respectively. (c) and (d) Best-fit curves for CR2 SCR 1-15 at a rotor speed of 17,000 rpm using interference optics at concentrations of 1.8 mg/ml and 1.4 mg/ml, respectively. The fits gave molecular masses of 139,000 and 136,000 Da, respectively.

within error, it was inferred that all 11 potential Nlinked glycosylation sites were occupied by oligosaccharide chains. Our value of 135,000(±13,000) Da is in good agreement with that of 134,000 Da found for the high mannose precursor form of CR2.31 If 11 complex-type oligosaccharide chains (NeuNAc4Gal4Man3GlcNAc6) are assumed to be present, this would have resulted in a predicted molecular weight of 143,000 Da, in good agreement with the molecular weight that is commonly assumed for wild-type CR2 SCR 1-15 as expected.31 o The sedimentation coefficient s20,w monitors macromolecular elongation and provides complementary structural data on CR2 SCR 1-15 that is an independent parameter comparable with the RG value. Velocity experiments were performed at five speeds between 15,000 rpm and 35,000 rpm using samples at concentrations between 0.5 mg/ml and 1.8 mg/ml in PBS buffer. Analysis using the g(s*) method to analyse o pairs of scans gave a mean s20,w value of 4.24(±0.1) S (Figure 5). This is in good agreement with the value of 4.5 S previously determined for rCR2 SCR 1-16.24 The frictional coefficient anisotropy ratio f/fO was calculated to be 1.96, while this is typically 1.2­1.3 for globular proteins. This again shows that CR2 SCR 1-15 possesses a relatively elongated solution structure. Modelling of the SCR domains of CR2 In order to progress to a full model of CR2 SCR 115 by constrained scattering modelling, molecular structures for the 15 SCR domains are required. The structures of CR2 SCR 1-2 were taken from the crystal structure of its complex with C3d.19 Struc-

tures for SCR 3-7 and SCR 9-15 were taken from the CCP module model database (Materials and Methods).32 Unlike the approach in which sequence searches against all the SCR domains of known structures identified the closest match for each domain, which was then used as a structural template for modelling, 27,33 the SCR domains were first clustered into nine different families A to I before these were modelled against known structural templates specific to each cluster. For CR2, the 15 SCR domains were classified into three clusters A, C and F. The cluster types were arranged as four imperfect tetrad repeats to follow the pattern AFAC, AFAX, AF*C and AFAF, with the SCR 8 domain being unassigned, and the inserted SCR domain 10a being similar to cluster A and asterisked (Figure 1(a)).32 This agrees with the identification of four long homologous repeats from the CR2 sequence.10,34 These models were used for the modelling of SCR 3-7 and SCR 9-15. SCR 8 had not been modelled by this approach, and this was created from a cluster C model based on SCR 11, in agreement with the highest sequence identity being found between SCR 5-8 and SCR 9-1110,34 and our sequence analyses using CLUSTAL (Materials and Methods). Constrained modelling of the domain arrangement in CR2 SCR 1-15 Constrained molecular modelling of the X-ray scattering data resulted in best-fit CR2 structures there being insufficient neutron data for this purpose except for the corroboration of the experimental X-ray analyses described above.

(a) and (b) The fits were based on interference data at rotor speeds of 25,000 rpm and 35,000 rpm, respectively, at a concentration of 1.8 mg/ml. The so 20,w values (arrowed) were determined to be 4.41 S and 4.46 S. (c) and (d) The fits were based on absorbance data for a sample concentration of 1.4 mg/ml at rotor speeds of 25,000 rpm and 35,000 rpm, respectively.

constraints were the 15 individual SCR domain models and the modelled linkers between these. The linkers vary in length between three and eight residues (Figure 1(b)). Unlike the majority of interdomain linkers in the SCR superfamily, six of these 14 linkers in CR2 are long at seven or eight residues (Figure 1(a)). Three modelling searches were performed to identify best-fit CR2 structures. Initially, it was assumed that the linkers could adopt any conformation. The first modelling search created 5000 randomised models in which the 14 SCR linkers were free from structural constraints. The RG values of the 5000 models ranged between 2.5 nm to 8.9 nm, all of which were much less than the experimental value of 11.5(±0.9) nm. None of these models were extended enough to satisfy the experimental RG value, and consequently the R2.0 factor values of 14% to 44% were relatively high. The second modelling search was improved by fixing the length of each linker peptide to be constrained within 0.25 nm of its maximum length between its N terminus and C terminus. The linkers were free to re-orientate themselves. This strategy followed that of the successful Randomised-1, Randomised-2 and Randomised-3 searches used to model the solution structure for FH.27 A sufficiently wide range of conformational possibilities for CR2 was generated by the modelling procedure. The sample of 100 views shown in Figure 6 confirmed that the 5000 models corresponded to the required wide range of different CR2 conformations in all orientations. The range of RG values of Figure 7 also confirmed this. The 5000 RG values ranged between

4.8 nm and 11.9 nm, of which 306 structures fitted the X-ray RG value of 11.5 nm to within 5% (Table 1). Many models also satisfied the experimental RXS value of 1.8 nm. It was however not possible to match simultaneously both the experimental RG and RXS values (Figure 7(a)). Models with an acceptable RG value showed an RXS value that was too low, and vice versa. To illustrate this, three CR2 models are identified in blue, green and red across Figure 7. The R2.0 factor values monitor the goodness of fit across the full scattering curve. The model with the lowest R2.0 factor best fitted the RXS data (blue). This best R2.0 factor model corresponded to an RG value of around 9 nm, which is lower than the experimental RG value of 11.5 nm. The models with the best-fit RG values gave high R2.0 values (red). If the Q range used to determine the R factor is reduced to 0.8 nm-1 (denoted R0.8), the minimum of the R factor values is noticeably shifted to the right to around 10 nm (Figure 7(c)). By sorting the models based on the R0.8 factor, from this the best-fit model (green) now gave an improved RG value of 9.8 nm and a similar RXS value of 1.7 nm. The R0.8 factor was good at 5.9 % whilst the R2.0 factor was 9.7 % (Table 1). The Q dependence of the R factors is attributed to the inability to model the full scattering curve as a single CR2 conformation. From this, it was concluded that CR2 is more flexible than expected. Its structure is best described as a family of varying SCR structural arrangements in equilibrium with each other, the average of which has been observed by scattering. The postulated domain flexibility and conformational variations in CR2 in solution is illustrated by the three models of Figure 7 and Table 1, which

present realistic alternatives that accounted for the curve fits to the experimental X-ray data in Figure 8. The red model of Figure 8(a) best fitted the experimental RG value (red in Figure 7). Its structure is relatively extended with a maximum length of 48 nm deduced from the P(r) curve shown as an inset. Neither the I(Q) or the P(r) fits are good, where the R0.8 and R2.0 values are 12.8% and 19.4%, respectively (Table 1). The blue model of Figure 8(b) corresponds to the best overall R factor. Its maximum dimension is 30 nm, which is less than that deduced from the experimental P(r) curve, while a good fit is shown to the RXS region in the I(Q) curve with a R0.8 value of 6.5%. The RG value is low at 9.1 nm for reason of the folding back of its SCR domains. The green model of Figure 8(c) gave the

best R0.8 value of 5.9%, while the R2.0 value is higher than that for the blue model for reason of the Q dependence of the R factors seen in Figure 7(b) and (c). The RG value is better at 9.8 nm, while the RXS value agrees well with experiment (Table 1). Its P(r) curve showed the best correspondence with the experimental curve of Figure 3. The maximum dimension of 35 nm is slightly shorter than the experimental one of 38 nm, while the modelled P(r) curve showed good agreement with both the M1 and M2 peaks. The three curve comparisons support the conclusion that CR2 has a flexible solution structure. It is likely that this solution structure corresponds to an average of several, of which the most typical is the green one, while the red and blue ones in Figure 8 represent two extremes.

1139 second modelling search. As for the first modelling search, none of these models fulfilled the experimental RG requirements. The RG values of the 5000 models ranged between 3.6 nm to 10.2 nm, all of which were much less than the experimental value of 11.5(±0.9) nm. This outcome suggested that the six longest linkers in CR2 exhibit a range of variable conformations. As an independent check of the scattering model0 ling, the sedimentation coefficients s20,W of the three models in Figure 8 were calculated from their atomic coordinates. The red, blue and green models 0 gave s20,W values of 3.38 S, 4.03 S and 3.83 S in that order, to be compared with the experimental value of 4.24(±0.1) S (Table 1). The green model that gave the best scattering modelling fit is in good accord with this experimental value, given that the agreement should be within 0.3 S.35 The more compact arrangement of SCR domains shown by the blue model gave a better agreement. The more extended agreement shown by the red model differed by 0.86 S. The calculations showed that the averaged CR2 SCR 1-15 structure is partially folded back, in agreement with the scattering modelling.

Conclusions
We have determined the first structure for intact CR2 SCR 1-15 in solution to provide new insight into the way in which CR2 interacts with C3d-coated antigens on the BCR to enhance the antibody response to antigen. CR2 SCR 1-15 is shown by both scattering and ultracentrifugation to be extended and flexible, but with evidence of folded back regions. The best-fit scattering model showed some degree of folded back SCR domains (Figure 8(c)). Such a structure was able to account for the two peaks in the P(r) curve at 6.1 nm and 22 nm. As shown for this case, the good fit was obtained with SCR 1-2 folded back towards SCR 4-6, and with a further slight turn around SCR 11-13. The appearance of the model in Figure 9 is suggestive of a "fish-hook"; however, we stress that other partially folded-back structures that fit the scattering data are possible. It should be noted that constrained modelling is unable to distinguish which specific region of CR2 SCR 1-15 is folded back against another; only the general degree to which this occurs. As an example of the longest possible CR2 model, that which best fitted the Guinier RG region of the curve at the lowest Q values still displayed a degree of partial folding back within their structure (Figure 8(a)). Other CR2 models best fitted the entire scattering curve and these are more compact with more folding back (Figure 8(b)). The length was determined from scattering to be 38 nm. This is consistent with earlier electron microscopy images of CR2 with 16 SCR domains whose length was determined as 38.6(±3.5) nm.24 The CR2 SCR arrangements shown in Figure 8 are consistent with these electron microscopy images, even though the latter were obtained in conditions that are harsh compared with those in solution.

(b) and (c) The R factor values show the goodness of agreement between the model and the experimental scattering curve. R2.0 corresponds to the R factor calculated in the Q range out to 2.0 nm-1, whilst R0.8 corresponds to the Q range out to 0.8 nm-1 and is weighted in favour of the low Q values used for the Guinier RG and RXS fits. Each model is denoted by a circle. The red circle corresponds to an elongated model, which best fits the experimental RG, denoted by the vertical brokenline. The blue circle shows a folded back model which best fits the experimental RXS (horizontal broken blue line). The green circle (arrowed in (c)) denotes the overall best-fit model, which gave good agreement with both the RG and RXS values.

If half of the six longest linkers in CR2 are bent by 90° at any given moment, simple geometry shows that the length of the resulting SCR structure would be reduced from the maximum possible of 54 nm to the required length of about 30­40 nm. Accordingly, as a control, a third modelling search tested another structural variant in which the six longest linkers in CR2 SCR 1-15 were held fixed in the V-shape structure determined for the best-fit model of free CR2 SCR 1-2.20 The remaining eight linkers were selected at random from the linker libraries created for the

This partially folded-back structure of CR2 SCR 1-15 is unique within the SCR superfamily. Solution studies so far have shown that proteins with five SCR domains (rat Crry, mouse Crry-Ig, and

2-glycoprotein I) display no tendency to form significantly folded back SCR structures.21,36 The inter-SCR linker lengths are four and five residues in rat and mouse Crry and three and four residues in 2-glycoprotein I. These proteins adopt SCR orientations that are extended but can be slightly bent. In comparison with the 20 SCR domains in FH, five of the 19 linkers in FH are long ones with six, seven or eight residues each, and FH is the most folded back SCR protein in this group. 27 The most likely functional reason for this difference from FH is that CR2 possesses ligand binding sites only on SCR 1-2 and SCR 5-8 (Figure 1(a)), while FH has multiple binding sites for C3 fragments and polyanionic oligosaccharides throughout its structure which may need to be brought into proximity for full functionality. It is noteworthy that the constrained modelling of the CR2 data yielded better scattering curve fits over a wider Q range (up to Q = 2.0 nm-1) than those observed for FH for which good curve fits extended only up to Q = 0.3 nm-1, indicating that the scattering modelling of FH requires improvement. CR2 contains proportionately the longest set of linker lengths in this group of SCR proteins. There are six long linkers of lengths seven or eight residues (Figure 1(a)). The previous modelling of CR2 SCR 12 gave six best-fit models with inter-domain angles of 63° to 121° (see Table 120). The inter-SCR domain angle between SCR 1-2 in CR2 in the crystal structures of the protein alone and in its complex with C3d are 37° and 40°, respectively, and these are fully folded back arrangements with SCR 1 and SCR 2 in contact with each other.18,19 This difference is a measure of how much the orientation can vary between two SCR domains if they are joined by an eight-residue linker. The longer linker lengths constitute the most likely reason for why CR2 has appeared as a partially folded-back SCR protein. It is possible that the observed partial folding back in CR2 is the consequence of weak interactions between the SCR domains in distant parts of the molecule. A Poisson­Boltzmann electrostatic map suggested that SCR 1-2 have predominantly basic surfaces, while SCR 5 has a partly-acidic surface mediated by Asp304, Asp306, Glu308 and Glu309, and this may provide an attractive force for some folding back between non-neighbouring SCR domains. Such inter-domain interactions could alternatively be protein­carbohydrate in their nature, although this is less likely to occur. These interactions would need to be weak and transient in

Figure 9. Views of the overall best-fit model for CR2 SCR 1-15 in comparison with its ligands, namely C3d, the C-type lectin domain of CD23 and IFN-. The CR2 conformation shown does not predict any proximity relationships between neighbouring SCR domains, only that the best-fit model is partially folded back. Ovalbumin is a model antigen when conjugated with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl (NP), and its crystal structure is shown for comparison. The SCR domains are numbered from 1 to 15 in the CR2 model (red; green in Figure 8). The ligands (blue) are based on crystal and NMR structures with the following PDB codes 1ghq, 1t8d and 1rh2, and that for ovalbumin has the PDB code 1ova. The IgM-S monomer model from solution scattering and the IgE-Fc fragment from X-ray crystallography (PDB code 1ls0) are shown face-on for comparison (green), in which the Fab and Fc fragments and the C2 and C2 domains are labelled. The scale bar corresponds to the average length of one SCR domain.

order to account for the observed extended CR2 structures. If the proposed inter-SCR interactions were stronger, this would result in a better-defined scattering curve, and a reduced discrepancy between the RG and RXS regions during the modelling. They would also lead to the formation of CR2 dimers in solution. No evidence of CR2 oligomer formation was seen in either the scattering or ultracentrifugation work here or previously.20,25 In addition to identifying the SCR domain arrangement in CR2, the scattering modelling was also useful to identify a significant degree of flexibility in CR2. This represents an extension of the scattering modelling study of inter-domain flexibility in the two-domain cellulases with a very long linker.37 Inter-conversions between several different CR2 models of the types shown in Figure 8 accounted for the inability to fit simultaneously both the RG and RXS values in any given single CR2 model. This flexibility in CR2 SCR 1-15 accounts for experimental observations showing that SCR domains in CR2 other than SCR 1-2 play a role in

ligand binding and suggests possible mechanisms of action for CR2.25 Biacore association studies have previously shown that the dissociation constant (KD) for the complex of CR2 SCR 1-15 with C3d is 27.5 nM and 27.1 nM.24,25 While the KD value was unchanged, the kinetic on- and off-rates were reduced for C3d binding to CR2 SCR 1-15 compared to CR2 SCR 1-2.25 In distinction, other more recent affinity studies with each of C3d, gp350 and IFN- binding to CR2 SCR 1-2, SCR 1-4 and SCR 1-1526 showed that the KD value increased as the number of SCR domains increased from two to 15. Despite the different outcome of the two studies, both studies showed that the SCR 3-15 domains are partially able to obstruct the ligand binding site on SCR 1-2 (Figure 1(a)). The ligand sizes of C3d and IFN-19,38 are compared with intact CR2 in Figure 9. In addition, ovalbumin is shown as an illustration of a typical model antigen, as its conjugate with 4hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl (NP) has been used in studies with CR2. These differential binding effects are readily explained in terms of the flexibility of full

1142 length CR2 identified here. The SCR 1-2 domains may move sufficiently close to SCR 3-15 to result in the partial obstruction of its SCR 1-2 ligand binding site. The C3d and IFN- ligands are large enough for any mobility between the SCR domains through its flexibility to interfere with their binding to the ligands (Figure 9). Another scenario is that SCR 1-2 may interact weakly with one or two other (as yet unidentified) SCR domains in CR2, with KD values in the mM or M ranges (see above). In such a case, this would mean that these three CR2 ligands would compete with these other SCR domains for binding to SCR 1-2, which would also account for the reduced ligand affinity of CR2 SCR 1-15 compared to CR2 SCR 1-2. In contrast to the behaviour of C3d, gp350 and IFN-, CD23 showed a marked increase in binding affinity with an increase in the number of SCR domains in CR2. 26 CD23 can mediate a functional co-ligation of the BCR with CR2 to result in a 10 to 100-fold reduction in the threshold concentration of anti-IgM antibodies required to induce proliferation of human tonsil B cells.40 CD23 is known to bind to both SCR 1-2 and SCR 5-8.17 The flexibility found in our CR2 SCR 1-15 solution structure would permit CD23 to simultaneously form contacts with both SCR 1-2 and SCR 5-8 and favour a folded-back CR2 structure. The location of CD23 in such a complex with CR2 may cause the Nterminal tip of CR2 to move into proximity to membrane-bound IgE molecules on the B cell surface, as suggested by Figure 9.39 The solution structure of CR2 SCR 1-15 can now be reviewed in the context of its involvement with the BCR as a co-receptor that links innate and adaptive immunity.41,42 The C3d fragment of C3 is attached to foreign antigens such as on the surface of invading microorganisms. These C3d-bound antigens amplify B cell responses by binding simultaneously to CR2 through C3d and the BCR. BCR molecules can be represented by the 14-domain monomeric IgM-S molecule, for which a solution structure is available from constrained scattering modelling (Figure 9).43 The cross-linking of CR2 to the BCR amplifies a signal transduction cascade through an activation complex formed by CR2 in association with CD19 and CD81 molecules (and other proteins). CD19 is the key signal-transducing component of the CR2/CD19/CD81 complex. It is thought that the complex formed between the interaction between CR2 and CD19 on the one hand and the BCR­antigen complex on the other is able to bring together phosphorylation sites on the cytoplasmic side of the B cell membrane within CD19 and the B cell receptor. This activates the B cell.41 Up to now cartoons of the CR2, CD19, CD81 and BCR proteins have not accurately explained how an extensively long 15-domain membranebound protein such as CR2 is able to interact with ligands near the cell surface. Such cartoons are often not drawn to scale. It is important to note that the individual lengths of each of the Ig domains in CD19 and BCR are similar to that of SCR domains,44 yet the maximum extension of these domains from a

membrane surface is low compared to what is possible with the 15 domains in CR2 (Figure 9). The importance of the flexibility between the SCR domains in our CR2 solution structure is that this enables CR2 to re-orientate itself in order to bind effectively to C3d on the surface of the antigen irrespective of the size or shape of the antigen, whether this be small as in the case of ovalbumin­ NP complexes, or large as in the case of entire bacterial surfaces. The six longest linkers in CR2 appear to act as conformationally variable joints, which are distributed throughout the length of CR2. The immunological importance of these linkers is shown by their unchanged lengths in murine and ovine CR211,45 (Figure 1), consistent with their functional significance across different species. BLAST sequence searches and CLUSTALW alignments suggest that predicted sequences for bovine and rat CR2 (NCBI accession codes XP_613039 and XP_ 213977) also possess identical linker lengths, although SCR 3 is missing in rat CR2 If this reasoning is correct, it can be deduced that CR2 is well designed for the optimal binding and anchoring of antigen­C3d complexes to the BCR receptor, enabling CD19 molecules to be clustered with the Ig and Ig polypeptides bound to the BCR and trigger the subsequent signalling events.41

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification of CR2 SCR 1-15 Human CR2 SCR 1-15 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells as a soluble recombinant protein in the baculovirus expression system as described.25 Briefly, the cDNA coding for the first 15 SCR domains with the native human Kozac consensus sequence and signal peptide was cloned into the pVL1393 baculoviral expression vector (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). A stop codon was introduced prior to the transmembrane domain to create a soluble secreted form of the receptor. After infection of the insect cells with the recombinant baculovirus spinner cultures were grown for five days at 27 °C. The supernatants were removed, filtered, and concentrated. The concentrate was dialysed overnight at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5)) that was diluted to onethird. The dialysed supernatant was passed through an HB-5 monoclonal antibody46 affinity column followed by a Protein G-Sepharose column in order to remove any trace contamination of HB-5. Immediately prior to scattering data acquisition, residual non-specific aggregates were removed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The CR2 SCR 1-15 concentration was determined using an absorption coefficient of 12.7 (1%, 280 nm, 1 cm path length), which was calculated from its composition (Ile21 to Arg971) by assuming the presence of 11 high mannose type oligosaccharides GlcNAc2Man7 (Figure 1).47 The Xray scattering curves and analytical ultracentrifugation data were measured in PBS. The neutron scattering experiments were measured in PBS dissolved in 99.9% 2 H2O. For these experiments, the protein was dialysed into PBS in 99.9% 2H2O at 6 °C for 48 h with three changes of

Solution Structure of CR2 SCR 1-5 dialysate. All CR2 SCR 1-15 samples were routinely analysed by SDS­PAGE before and after scattering and ultracentrifugation experiments to confirm their integrity. X-ray data from Instrument ID02 at the ESRF X-ray scattering data were collected in three independent sessions on the ID02 high brilliance beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, operating at a ring energy of 6.03 GeV.48 To reduce the incident flux on the sample, experiments were performed in four-bunch and single-bunch modes with beam currents in a range between 12.1 mA and 41.2 mA, instead of the 992 bunches used in normal multi-bunch mode (beam current 200 mA). The final data analyses were performed with a sample-to-detector distance of 3.0 m, which yielded a Q range from 0.07 nm-1 to 2.1 nm-1. Twelve CR2 SCR 1-15 concentrations between 0.5 and 2.5 mg/ml in PBS were measured at 15 °C in Perspex cells of sample volume 20 l, contained within mica windows of thickness between 10 m to 15 m. For each sample, two sets of ten time frames were taken, with an exposure time of 0.2 s, 0.5 s, or 1.0 s per frame. Buffers were measured for the same exposure times in alternation with the samples to minimise background subtraction errors. Data reduction included the use of a Lupolen sample for the calibration of detector intensities, and a silver behenate salt standard (C21H43COOAg) with a dspacing of 5.84 nm for the calibration of the Q range,49 followed by the subtraction of the buffer background runs from the sample runs as described.20,21,27 Neutron data from instrument LOQ at ISIS Neutron scattering data were obtained in one beam session on the LOQ instrument at the pulsed neutron source ISIS at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, UK.50 The pulsed neutron beam was derived from a proton beam of current 170 A. Monochromatisation was achieved using time-of-flight techniques. A 3He ORDELA wire detector recorded intensities at a fixed sample-to-detector distance of 4.3 m. Samples and buffers were measured in 2 mm thick rectangular quartz Hellma cells positioned in a thermostatted rack at 15 °C. Data acquisitions were for 80 × 106­160 × 106 monitor counts in runs lasting 3 h for CR2 SCR 1-15 at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. Spectral intensities were normalised relative to the scattering from a partially deuterated polystyrene standard.51 Transmissions were measured for all samples and backgrounds. Reduction of the raw data collected in 100 time frames of 64 × 64 cells utilised the standard ISIS software package COLETTE.52 Scattered intensities were binned into individual diffraction patterns based on the wavelength range from 0.22 nm to 1.00 nm, and were corrected for a linear wavelength-dependence of the transmission measurements. The patterns were merged to give the scattering curve I(Q) in a Q range of 0.06 nm-1­2.7 nm-1. The Q range was based on 0.04% logarithmic increments, which was optimal both for Guinier analyses at low Q and better signal-noise ratios at large Q. Analysis of reduced X-ray and neutron data For a given solute­solvent contrast, the radius of gyration (RG) is a measure of structural elongation provided that the internal inhomogeneity of the glycoprotein

scattering densities has no effect. Guinier analyses at low Q give the RG and the forward scattering at zero angle I(0):53 ln IðQÞ ¼ ln Ið0Þ À R2 Q2 =3 G This equation is valid in a Q.RG range of up to 1.5. The relative I(0)/c values (where c = sample concentration) for samples measured in the same buffer gives the relative molecular weights of the proteins when referenced against a suitable standard.54 The RG analyses were performed using a PERL script program SCTPL7 (J.T. Eaton & S.J. P., unpublished software) on Silicon Graphics O2 Workstations. Indirect transformation of the reciprocal space scattering data into real space to give the distance distribution function P(r) was implemented using the program GNOM:55,56 Z l 1 PðrÞ ¼ 2 I ðQÞQrsinðQrÞdQ 2k o P(r) represents the distribution of distance vectors r between pairs of atoms within a molecule. The calculations are based on the full scattering curve (unlike the Guinier analyses which use only data at low Q values) and provide another calculation of the RG and I(0) values as well as giving the maximum dimension of a molecule, L. A range of Dmax values was tested and the final choice of Dmax was based on three criteria: (i) P(r) should exhibit positive values; (ii) the RG from GNOM should agree with that derived from the Guinier analyses; and (iii) the P(r) curve should be stable as Dmax is increased beyond the estimated maximum dimension of the molecule. The CR2 SCR 1-15 X-ray I(Q) curve contained 569 data points between Q values of 0.08 nm-1 to 2.07 nm-1 and was fitted with Dmax set as 38 nm. Analytical ultracentrifugation data acquisition and analysis Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed on a Beckman XL-I instrument equipped with an An50Ti rotor in which the protein concentration distribution within the cell was monitored using its absorbance monitored at 280 nm and its refractive index measured by interferometry. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed for CR2 SCR 1-15 at four concentrations between 0.5 mg/ml and 1.8 mg/ml in PBS. Data were acquired over 45 h using six-sector cells with column heights of 2 mm at rotor speeds of 11,000 rpm 14,000 rpm, 17,000 rpm, 20,000 rpm and 25,000 rpm until equilibrium had been reached at each speed as shown by the perfect overlay of runs measured at 5 h intervals. The molecular weight (MW) was analysed on the basis of a single species using Beckman software provided as an add-on to Origin Version 4.1 (Microcal Inc.), for which the partial specific volume  for CR2 SCR 1-15 was calculated ¯ to be 0.729 ml/g from its amino acid and carbohydrate content calculated from its sequence:47 cr ¼ cro exp½ðN2 =2RTÞMWð1 À r UÞðr2 À r2 Þ ¯ o where cr is the concentration at radius r, cro is the concentration of the monomer at the reference radius ro,  is the angular velocity, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and  is the solvent density. Sedimentation velocity data were acquired over 16 h at rotor speeds of 15,000 rpm, 20,000 rpm, 25,000 rpm, 30,000 rpm and 35,000 rpm in two-sector cells with solution column heights of 12 mm. The experiments were

1144
performed at four concentrations between 0.46 mg/ml and 1.84 mg/ml in PBS. For the g(s*) analyses, successive absorbance and interference scans were recorded at 8 min intervals, the shortest interval possible under standard measurement conditions. In time-derivative analyses, the subtraction of pairs of concentration scans versus radius in the cell eliminates systematic errors from baseline distortions in the cell windows and permits the averaging of many pairs of subtractions. The extrapolation of individual subtractions to the start time gives the g(s*) function, which was computed using the DCDT+ program (v1.16),57 from which the sedimentation coefficient s0 20,W was determined from the peak position (Figure 5). The fits were determined in conditions when the maximum permissible measurable molecular weight was over 16 times the expected value, meaning that time broadening effects were negligible. Modelling and conformational searches for CR2 SCR 1-15 Models for the 15 SCR domains of CR2 were obtained as follows. SCR 1 and SCR 2 were taken from the crystal structure of CR2 SCR 1-2 in its complex with C3d (PDB code, 1ghq).19 The SCR 3 to SCR 7 and the SCR 9 to SCR 15 domains were taken from the CCP module model database.32 Each SCR domain in CR2 was assigned to either cluster A, C or F of nine clusters lettered A to I, then the structures in each cluster were modelled based on known SCR structures when available using MODELLER.58 A model for SCR 8 was not available by this approach for reason of its low sequence similarity. The use of BLAST and CLUSTALW (v1.82) based on SCR domains with known structures and the other CR2 SCR domains showed that CR2 SCR 8 had the highest sequence similarity with CR2 SCR 11. The model for CR2 SCR 11 was therefore used as a template, and the SCR 8 model was constructed using Insight II 98.0 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) software on Silicon Graphics workstations. Energy refinements were performed using the DISCOVER module, and the structure was verified using PROCHECK.59 As CR2 was expressed with a baculovirus system in Sf9 insect cells, models for high mannose type (Man7GlcNAc2) oligosaccharides were incorporated at each of the 11 Nlinked glycosylation sites on SCR 1 to SCR 15 (Figure 1). These were modelled in conformations that extended away from the protein surface. Two different libraries of linker structures were created. In both, the linker sequences contained the last Cys residue of the previous SCR domain and the first Cys residue of the subsequent SCR domain in order to allow superimposition of the linkers onto the domains. In the first library, sets of 5000 unconstrained structures were created for each of the 14 linkers within CR2 SCR 1-15 using molecular dynamics simulations.27,60 In the second library, each linker was constrained to within 0.25 nm of its possible maximum length in order to create 14 sets of 500 extended structures in all orientations. Three modelling searches were performed. In the first one, 5000 full CR2 models were created that were completely free of inter-SCR constraints. Linkers for each SCRSCR connection were selected at random from each of the 14 sets of the first library and superimposed onto the appropriate pair of SCR domains using their terminal Cys residues. In the second search, a further 5000 models were created in which the linkers were obtained from the second library. In the third search, only the linkers with six residues  http://www.bru.ed.ac.uk/dinesh/ccp-db.html

Solution Structure of CR2 SCR 1-5 or fewer were varied. These shorter linkers were taken from the second linker library. For the six remaining longer linkers of lengths seven or eight residues (Figure 1(a)), the linker that was found in the best-fit solution structure for free CR2 SCR 1-220 was used as a template. Debye scattering curve and sedimentation modelling of CR2 SCR 1-15 In order to calculate the X-ray scattering curves, Debye sphere models were created by placing each full coordinate model for CR2 SCR 1-15 within a three-dimensional grid of cubes, where each cube side is of length 0.496 nm. This length is much less than the nominal resolution of the scattering curves. Provided that the number of atoms within a given cube exceeded a user-defined cutoff, a sphere of the same volume as the cube (sphere diameter 0.615 nm) was placed at the centre of the cube. This cutoff was determined by the requirement that the total volume of spheres in each model was within 1% of the dry volume of 151.4 nm3 for CR2 SCR 1-15 (1223 dry spheres), calculated from its amino acid and carbohydrate composition.47 X-ray scattering and sedimentation modelling requires the addition of a hydration shell. A hydration of 0.3 g H2O/g glycoprotein and an electrostricted volume of 0.0245 nm3 per bound water molecule35,47 gave a total hydrated volume of 200.8 nm3. This shell was modelled using the HYPRO procedure61 in which excess spheres were uniformly added to the surface of the dry sphere model, and these were sequentially removed until the desired hydration volume of 1581 spheres had been reached. The X-ray scattering curve I(Q) was calculated assuming a uniform scattering density for the spheres using the Debye equation as adapted to spheres.62 The X-ray curves were calculated from the hydrated sphere models without corrections for wavelength spread or beam divergence as these are considered to be negligible for synchrotron X-ray data. The modelled scattering curves were assessed by calculation of the RG and RXS values from the same Q ranges used for the experimental Guinier fits, in which filters corresponding to ±5% of the experimental values were applied. Models that passed these filters were then ranked using a goodness-of-fit R factor defined by analogy with protein crystallography and based on the experimental curves in the Q range extending to 0.8 nm-1 and 2.0 nm-1 (denoted as R0.8 and R2.0, respectively).63 Version 5a of the HYDROPRO program was used to calculate the s0 20,W values directly from the best-fit molecular models of CR2 SCR 1-15 without recourse to sphere models. The recommended value of 0.31 nm was used for the atomic element radius for all atoms as an empirical approximation of the hydration shell.64 Protein Data Bank accession numbers The best-fit -carbon coordinate model for CR2 SCR 1-15 (Figure 8(c)) has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 2gsx.
