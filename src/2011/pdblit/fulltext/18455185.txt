Abstract Arabidopsis thaliana P1 protein was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method in 0.1 M piperazine-1,4bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) buffer, containing 14% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 0.2 M magnesium acetate at pH 6.5 and 20³C. The crystals are orthorhombic and belong to the space group P21 21 21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 49.8, b = 122.4 and î î c = 149.9 A. The diffraction data up to 2.9 A were collected by a multiwire area detector. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A family of proteins belonging to j-crystallin (ZCr) is widely distributed in various organisms and exerts various physiological functions [1]. ZCr, a major lens protein in hystricomorph rodents and camelids [2], exhibits an NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase activity [3,4]. ZCr from guinea pig catalyzes the univalent reduction of quinones to produce semiquinones [3]. The congenital cataract in guinea pig caused by ZCr-de¢ciency [5,6] suggests a protecting role of ZCr against oxidative damage of lens cells, probably as an NADPH pool [7]. The ZCr-homologous domains in the rat fatty acid synthase and the

Saccharopolyspora erythrea erythronolide synthase show an NADPH:enoyl-CoA reductase activity [8,9]. Similarly, crotonoyl-CoA reductase in Streptomyces collinus is also a ZCr homolog [10]. Some ZCrs may participate in oxidative stress response in yeast [11], and programmed cell death in plants [12,13] and in human [14]. Such diverse physiological functions of ZCrs might be resulted from the recruitment of the ancestral gene according to various physiological requirements [15^17]. We have recently cloned the ZCr homolog P1 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, by the ability to confer tolerance on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae against the thiol-oxidizing reagent diamide [18]. The recombinant P1 protein (P1p) expressed in Escherichia coli formed a dimer and exhibited NADPH-speci¢c reductase activities for dual classes of electron

acceptors; quinones and azodicarbonyl compounds [19]. P1p and guinea pig ZCr share common reactivity to quinones, the univalent reduction of quinones and the incompatibility to menadione. In addition, P1p did not show an enoyl-CoA reductase activity, another typical activity observed in several ZCr homologs [8^10]. Therefore P1p is distinguished from other ZCr homologs and can be referred to as an NADPH: azodicarbonyl/quinone oxidoreductase. The question is addressed what tertiary structure of P1p allows such dual modes of substrate recognition and reaction. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli quinone oxidoreductase (QOR) [20] revealed that the high speci¢city to NADPH, common in ZCrs, is based on the insertion of an Ala residue into the nucleotide-binding site, as compared with that of alcohol dehydrogenases [21]. As for the substrate speci¢city, however, structural information is limited. In spite of the highly similar quinone speci¢city in P1p and guinea pig ZCr [19] (Mano et al., in preparation), P1p does not apparently conserve the amino acid residues that line the substrate binding sites of both guinea pig ZCr and E. coli QOR [21]. P1p is less similar to QOR than ZCr is (amino acid identity between P1p and QOR is 16%, while that between QOR and ZCr is 28%). Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of P1p with that of QOR will reveal the structural basis for the common substrate speci¢city in ZCrs (i.e. to quinones) and the speci¢c one in P1p (i.e. to azodicarbonyls). The Arabidopsis P1 gene inserted into pET19b vector (Novagen) was overexpressed in E. coli [19,20], and the recombinant P1p comprising the poly-(His) tag on its N-terminus was used for the crystallization study. The recombinant P1p was puri¢ed by nickelchelating Sepharose 4B column chromatography and Hiload Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column chromatography. The puri¢ed recombinant P1p was homogeneous on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant P1p was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor-di¡usion method. The solution of a crystallization drop was prepared on a silanized coverslip by mixing 3 Wl of protein solution (21.8 mg protein per ml in 100 mM Tris^HCl and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl £uoride, pH 7.5) with 3 Wl of bottom solution (14% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 0.2 M magnesium acetate in 0.1 M piperazine-1,4-

bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid), pH 6.5. The droplets were equilibrated against 1 ml of the bottom solution at 20³C. Small crystals were obtained in 1 month. In order to obtain large crystals suitable for data collection, micro and macro seeding techniques were applied under the same crystallization conditions. The needle-like crystals grew to a long square pillar shape (0.8U0.2U0.2 mm in size) in 3 months by the macro seeding method (Fig. 1). The crystals were reasonably stable against mechanical treatment and against X-ray radiation damage. The crystals were mounted in thin-walled glass capillaries for X-ray analysis. Both ends of the capillary were ¢lled with the mother liquor and then sealed with wax. The î di¡raction data of native crystal up to 2.9 A were collected with a Bruker Hi-Star multiwire area detector at 20³C, using CuKK radiation generated by MAC Science M18XHF rotating anode generator, and were processed with the SADIE and SAINT software packages (Bruker). Systematic absence of re£ections (h00, 0k0, 00l) indicated that the space group is P21 21 21 (orthorhombic). The unit cell diî mensions are a = 49.8, b = 122.4, c = 149.9 A. The 5 î3 unit cell volume is 9.13U10 A . The di¡ractions î up to 2.9 A were collected with R-sym of 17.2 and 92.5% completeness for 19 598 re£ections. The density of the P1p crystals was measured in a Ficoll gradient [22] to be 1.18 g/cm3 at 25³C. Using a partial speci¢c volume of proteins, 0.733 cm3 /g as estimated from the amino acid composition of the P1p, the number of molecule/asymmetric unit was calculated to be 2.26. Assuming two protomers per asymmetric unit, the solvent volume fraction (Vsol ) [22]

The Vm value was within the range for typical water soluble protein î crystals (Vm = 1.7^3.5 A3 /Da) [23].
