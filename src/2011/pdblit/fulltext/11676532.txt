Amide-hydrogen exchange of three anti-yeast iso-l-cytochrome-c IgG monoclonal antibodies and the Fab, prepared from one of them, were studied by infrared spectrophotometry in the presence and absence of the deuterated immunogen and evolutionarily related species (the deuterated immunogen contained a population of a dimer. Each subunit of the dimer appeared to bind to the antibodies in a manner similar to the monomer). The number of hydrogens of the antibodies whose exchange was suppressed on binding to the immunogen was found to exceed that estimated for the residues shielded by the immunogen. Analysis of the data suggests that such suppression of hydrogen exchange occurs mainly for the Fab domains, but not for the Fc. One of the antibodies showed two distinct classes of amide-hydrogens. Class-1 hydrogens (approx. 36/site) exchange faster than class 2 (approx. 37/site). The exchange of class-1 hydrogens was suppressed by binding to the immunogen, but not to the evolutionarily related species. The exchange of class-2 hydrogens was suppressed by binding to the evolutionarily related species, as well as to the immunogen. Thus, the suppression of exchange of class-1 hydrogens appears to occur by some kind of conformational stabilization, the mechanism of which differentiates between the deutcrated immunogen and the evolutionarily related species. Evidence suggests that the trans-interactions of the Fab domains may modulate the hydrogen exchange. If it is assumed that the antigen-binding strengthens the trans-interactions in such a way that the exchange of the slower exchanging hydrogens is suppressed, this could explain the suppression of exchange of class-2 hydrogens.

Introduction
Liberti and colleagues [1] have shown, in their hydrogen exchange studies of F(ab') 2 fragments of sheep and rabbit antibodies, that ligand binding not only shields the residues at the binding site, but also stabilizes a structural region of the F(ab') 2 away from the binding site. Zavodszky and colleagues [2] have concluded, based on amide-hydrogen exchange measurements of rabbit antibodies, that antigen-binding increases the conformational stability of antibodies. If a

long-range interaction between the antigen-antibody interface and the antibody domains is assumed, such decrease in energy of the antibody conformation should, in turn, increase the affinity to the antigen. Thus, we have thought (cf., Ref. 3) that the antigen-antibody interaction may not be confined to the antigenantibody interface and that it might spread to distant regions such as those interior of the V e and V H. In relation to this idea, the studies of Scharff and colleagues are interesting [4,5]. They have shown that substitution of a residue of a variable region of antibodies which is remote from the antigen-binding site abolishes the antigen-binding ability. We have thought that this might be another aspect of the phenomenon in which distant regions influence the antigen-antibody interaction. In light of this view, to know more about the structural regions of antibodies which are stabilized on antigen-binding, we have studied amide-hydrogen exchange of monoclonal IgG antibodies to yeast iso-l-cytochrome c 2-96-12, 4-74-6 and 4-128-6 [3] and the Fab fragment of mAb 4-74-6 in the presence and absence

170 of the deuterated immunogen (yeast iso-l-cytochrome c) and evolutionarily related species (the deuterated immunogen contained a population of a dimeric form. The subunits of the dimer appeared to bind to the monoclonal antibodies in a manner similar to the monomer). For monoclonal antibodies, different rates of hydrogen exchange represent different residues or different groups of residues. On the other hand, for polyclonal antibodies, homologous residues or homologous groups of residues of different populations could show different rates of hydrogen exchange. Therefore, monoclonal antibodies may exhibit changes of hydrogen exchange rates on antigen-binding which are difficult to detect for polyclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibody 2-96-12 has an epitope which contains Asp-65 of yeast iso-l-cytochrome c and crossreacts with yeast iso-2, Candida, tuna, pigeon, chicken, rabbit, rat, dog, bovine and horse cytochromes c [3]. Monoclonal antibody 4-74-6 shows an epitope which contains Leu-63 a n d / o r Ash-67 a n d / o r Asn-68 of yeast-iso-l-cytochrome c and cross-reacts with none of the above evolutionary related species [3]. Monoclonal antibody 4-128-6 possesses an epitope which contains Glu-93 of yeast-iso-l-cytochrome c and cross-reacts with yeast iso-2-cytochrome c. The cross-reaction of this monoclonal antibody with Candida, tuna and horse cytochromes c was marginal or undetectable [3]. The cross-reaction with yeast iso-l-apocytochrome c was undetectable for mAb 2-96-12 and 4-128-6 and very weak for 4-74-6 [3]. In this report, we show that the number of amidehydrogens of mAb 4-74-6, whose exchange rate decreases on immunogen-binding, is significantly greater than an estimated number if shielding of the antigenbinding site were solely responsible for the decrease in the exchange rate. We also show that the total number of hydrogens of mAb 4-74-6 whose exchange is suppressed is essentially accounted for by the number of hydrogens of the Fab whose exchange is suppressed on binding to the immunogen. Then, we show with mAb 2-96-12 that there are two distinct classes of amide-hydrogens whose exchange is suppressed on binding to the immunogen. These two classes of hydrogens, one exchanging faster than the other, respond completely differently to binding to the evolutionarily related species in terms of a decrease of the exchange rate or lack of it. A preliminary account of this work has been published elsewhere [6].
Materials and Methods

Preparation and purification of monoclonal antibodies
Cells of each of hybridoma cell lines 4-74-6, 4-128-6 and 2-96-12 were grown to log phase as previously described [3]. Ascites of B a l b / c female mice containing monoclonal antibodies were prepared according to the protocol of Goding [8] using pristane treatment and intraperitoneal injection of the hybridoma cells. The supernatant solution of ascites was loaded on an affinity column (0.8 × 9.3 cm) containing yeast iso1-cytochrome c coupled to CH-Sepharose 4B (LKBPharmacia) at 8°C (a maximal capacity, approx. 20 mg of the monoclonal antibodies). The column had been equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline (6.66 mM, pH 7.4). After washing with the phosphate buffered saline, the column was eluted using 0.1 M glycine-HCI (pH 2.5). The eluent containing the monoclonal antibodies was immediately neutralized by adding 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (final concentration, 0.119 M) and then lyophilized. The monoclonal samples thus obtained were homogenous based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [9].

Preparation of the Fab fragments
The methods of Good et al. [10], Harlow and Lane [11] and Andrew and Titus [12] were used to construct a protocol. Briefly, a sample of purified mAb 4-74-6 was dialyzed against 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.5, 8°C, 19-20 h) and then concentrated to approx. 5.1 mg protein/ml (based on absorbance at 280 nm, Ref. 13) using Centricon 30 tubes (Amicon). To 4 ml of the concentrated solution 160 ~1 of 20 mM EDTA, 160 p~l of 1 M cysteine and 9 #1 of 31 m g / m l papain (Worthington Biochemical) were added. After incubation at 37°C for 2 h, 480 ~1 of 0.5 M iodoacetamide was added. After 15 min, the mixture was subjected to affinity chromatography (see above) to separate the Fab from the Fc (the yield of the Fab was 12.2 mg). To ensure complete removal of undigested monoclonal antibodies, chromatography of the Fab sample was carried out on a Sephacryl 5-200 (LKB- Pharmacia) column (4 × 120 cm) at 8°C using 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.01). Electrophoresis showed that the sample thus purified was homogenous (Fig. 1). The exception is that a small amount of smaller molecular weight materials than the Fab are seen in the pattern (Fig. 1). Since they were bound to the affinity column, they were likely to contain the antigen-binding site and, therefore, not to contain the Fc. Thus, this contamination was ignored.

Preparation of deuterated cytochromes c Materials
Samples of yeast iso-1 (Saccharomyces cereuisiae), horse, tuna and bovine cytochromes c from Sigma were purified as previously described [7]. Yeast iso-1, horse, tuna, and bovine cytochromes c were fully deuterated, so that their hydrogen exchange was transparent in the measurement described below. The samples were deuterated by incubation with DzO

171 (Fluka) in the presence of 3 M guanidine HCI (cf., Ref. 14) at approx, p D 5 for 1 h at 23°C. This was followed by gel-filtration, using Sephadex G-25 M-pD-10 columns (LKB-Pharmacia) and D20. Aliquots of this desalted solution, each containing a suitable amount (e.g., 0.44 mg) of the deuterated samples, were lyophilized. Complete deuteration of the samples was confirmed by the observations that the ratio of amide II absorbance to amide I (see below) did not change after incubation with D 2 0 for 24 h (the ratio ranged from 0.109 to 0.179 depending on the cytochrome c species). Based on the ELISA [15], the affinity of the deuterated yeast iso-l-cytochrome c sample was found to be equal to the nondeuterated sample for mAb 4-74-6 and greater, and slightly greater than the non-deuterated species for mAb 2-96-12 and 4-128-6, respectively, using the purified monoclonal samples. The mAb 4-74-6 and 4-128-6 samples cross-reacted with neither deuterated nor non-deuterated horse cytochrome c [3]. The mAb 2-96-12 sample cross-reacted with tuna and horse cytochromes c regardless of whether the cytochromes c were deuterated or not [3]. The deuterated horse cytochrome c sample was homogenous by get filtration on Sephadex 50 F (Pharmacia) and exhibited a 695 nm absorption band with the same absorptivity as that of the non-deuterated sample. This band is indicative of the Met-80S-heme Fe 3÷ bond [16]. The deuterated tuna and bovine cytochrome c samples exhibited 97 and 88%, respectively, of the absorptivity of the 695 nm band of the non-deuterated samples. These two deuterated samples showed a blue shift by approx. 1 nm or less of a )tma x of a Soret band. The tuna sample also showed a weak absorption band around 650 nm (cf., Ref. 17). The deuterated yeast iso-l-cytochrome c sample showed a decrease in absorptivity, by approx. 42%, of the 695 nm band, a significant extinction of an absorption band around 650 nm and a blue shift by approx. 1 nm of a ,h.max of a Soret band. The sample apparently contained approx. 40% of a dimer (based on the amount of monomer), presumably consisting of two monomers linked by an inter-chain disulfide bond involving Cys107. The dimer was identified by comparison of the gel filtration patterns of the deuterated and non-deuterated samples with that reported by Bryant et al. [18] for a disulfide dimer of yeast iso-l-cytochrome c. The latter disulfide dimer has been shown [18] to retain the 3-D structure resembling the monomer. The deuterated yeast iso-l-cytochrome c sample was used without removal of the dimer. This is justified for the following reason: Based on the report of Bryant et al. [18] and the result of ELISA described above, the present dimer is likely to retain the 3-D structure resembling the monomer. The optical properties of the deuterated sample described above indicate that the heme crevice of the dimer is perturbed (cf., Ref. 19). However, these optical properties are very similar to those for one of the substituted yeast iso-l-cytochrome c studied by Ramdas et al. [19], that contained Thr in place of Pro-76. Thus, by analogy to the mutant [19], the overall conformational perturbation of the dimer is assumed not to be large * The epitope of each of the three monoclonal antibodies used is spatially removed from Cys-107 [3]. Therefore, the monomer subunits of the dimer are likely not to significantly interfere with each other for binding to any one of the monoclonal antibodies used. This hypothesis is supported by the ELISA, showing that the affinity of the deuterated yeast iso-l-cytochrome c sample to any one of the three monoclonal

The concentration of deuterated yeast iso-l-cytochrome c is based on the sum of the monomer and the subunit.

Hydrogen-deuterium exchange
Amide-hydrogen-deuterium exchange was measured by infrared s p e c t r o p h o t o m e t r y [20-24], using a Perkin-Elmer Model 1420 Ratio Recording Infrared Spectrophotometer and CaF 2 cells of 0.1 mm path length (Spectra-Tech). The purified monoclonal samples (see above) were dialyzed against 12.5 mM NaC1 at 8°C for 17 h. After concentration, the dialyzed solution was divided into aliquots, each containing a suitable amount (e.g., 2.82 mg) of protein and 5.5/xmol of NaCI. To each of these a[iquots, placed in microtubes, 110 #1 of 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) was added. The mixtures were lyophilized. For the experiments in the absence of cytochrome c, 110 ~1 of DzO was added to one of the dried samples to initiate the hydrogen exchange. For the experiments in the presence of the antigen, one of the deuterated and dried samples of appropriate cytochrome c (see above) was dissolved in 110/,tl of D 2 0 and added to one of the monoclonal samples. The zero time is the instant at which D , O or the deuterated cytochrome c / D 2 0 was added. A reference was a D~O solution containing the same components, except antibodies or antibodies and deuterated cytochrome c. Spectra of an experimental solution were recorded between 1250 and 1800 cm-~ at 23-25°C as a function of time (Fig. 2). The recording was repeated at a given time point (45 s per recording, 8 cm -~ resolution according to manufacturer's specification). In a typical experiment the numbers of recording at a given time point are: 1 between 3 and 8 rain; 2 - 4 between 12 and 48 rain; 4 - 5 between 1 and 5 h; 5 - 6 between 6 and 24 h and 6 - 7 between 48 and 72 h. Amide I (AI) and amide II (AII) absorbances were determined at 1640 cm ~ [24] and 1545 cm-~ [23], respectively, after correction for the background absorbances (Fig. 2). Then, the average value for A I I / A I at a given time point t was used as the value for A I I / A I at time t. Both experimental and reference ceils were removed from a compartment of an infrared spectrophotometer each time the instrument was being reset for a second recording. This resulted in no appreciable increase in the temperature of the experimental solution after repeating the recording up to 8 times, as judged by touching the cells. The experiments for the Fab were also similarly carried out with the following exception. A solution of

FREQUENCY (era 1) Fig. 2. Changes of infrared spectra of monoclonal anti-yeast iso-l-cytochrome c 4-74-6 in deuterium oxide in the presence of deuterated horse cytochrome c. The absorbance of the amide II band at 1545 cm t decreases as time passes, while that of the amide I band at 1640 cm E remains unchanged [23]. The increase in absorbance at 1450cm [ is due to deuteration of peptide groups and formation of D H O [20,21]. The concentrations of the antibody and horse cytochrome c were 0.11 and 0.80 mM, respectively. The experimental details are described in Materials and Methods.

0.32 mM Fab/0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) was divided into aliquots of 110 #1 each. To each of these aliquots 110 #[ of 50 mM NaCI was added. The mixtures were lyophilized.

Data reduction
The fraction of unexchanged amide-hydrogen ( U E P H ) is calculated according to the formula of Ottesen [23] (Eqn. 1).

(AII,/AI)~ - (AII/'AI)o

where ( A I I / A I ) , , ( A l l / A D o and ( A I I / A I ) ~ stand for A I I / A I at times t, zero and infinite, respectively. ( A I I / A I ) o was determined using films of antibodies on CaF 2 windows [23]. The values thus found are 0.523 _+ 0.006 (2 experiments), 0.514 _+ 0.004 (1 experiment) and 0.609 _+ 0.016 (3 experiments) for mAb 2-96-12, 4-74-6 and 4-128-6, respectively (the error for one experiment is based on repeated recordings). ( A I I / A I ) ~ was measured with samples incubated at p D 11 (with N a O D ) at 37°C for one week. The values thus determined are 0.117 _+ 0.002 (1 experiment), 0.122 _+ 0.001 (I experiment) and 0.094 _+ 0.016 (2 experiments), respectively, for the above respective antibodies. The values for

173 ( A l l / A D o and (AII/AI)~ of the Fab are assumed to be the same as those of the parent antibody. These values are comparable with those reported for polyclonal IgG [24]. ( A I I / A I ) t was d e t e r m i n e d as follows. First, ( A I I / A I ) , was determined in one experiment as described above ( A I I / A I as a function of time). Second, the same experiment was repeated 2-6 times, each time using a new incubation mLxture containing the same components. Then, the average values for ( A I I / A I ) , and the standard error were calculated. In cases in which one of the deuterated cytochrome c samples was present in the experimental solution, the contributions of such deuterated species to AI and AII (see above) were corrected. The affinity of mAb 2-96-12 and 4-74-6 to the immunogen after the hydrogen exchange incubation (72 h) was found by ELISA to be the same as that of a sample stored at -20°C. This indicates that denaturation due to the exchange incubation did not occur to a significant extent. In the case of the Fab, an experimental solution containing the Fab and deuterated horse cytochrome c was applied to an affinity column after 72 h hydrogen-exchange incubation. The Fab was found to quantitatively bind to the column, indicating no significant denaturation.

Fig. 3. The exchange curve of amide-hydrogens of mAb 4-74-6 alone and those in the presence of the deuterated yeast iso-l-cytochrome c and horse cytochrome c (one at a time) at pD 7.0. The value for A I I / A I at a given time is the average of 5 experiments for the antibody alone (0) and 4 and 2 experiments for the antibody with the yeast iso-1 (_1) and horse cytochrome c (11), respectively. The standard errors are indicated by vertical bars. The concentration of the antibody was 0.11 mM and that of yeast iso-l- and horse cytochrome c was 0.32 and 0.80 raM, respectively. The experimental details are described in Materials and Methods.

Amide-hydrogen exchange of monoclonal antibodies 474-6 and 4-128-6 in the presence and absence of deuterated immunogen Monoclonal antibody 4-74-6 has shown the amidehydrogen exchange curve (Fig. 3), which apparently consists of faster and slower phases. The slowest phases correspond to approx. 12% of the amide hydrogens and exhibit a half-life or lives of approx. 232 h a n d / o r greater (Table I).

In the presence of the deuterated immunogen, at a molar ratio of 1.45:1 with respect to the binding site, the hydrogen exchange became suppressed apparently in all phases of the exchange curve (Fig. 3 and Table I). For example, in the presence of the immunogen, 39 + 8 and 56 + 7 more amide-hydrogens per antigen-binding site remained unexchanged at 3 and 72 h, respectively, than in the absence of the immunogen (Table II). The number of hydrogens whose exchange was suppressed when excess immunogen was used with respect to the binding site (Table II, experiment 1) was the same within errors as that when an equimolar amount of the immunogen was used (Table II, experiment 2). This indicates that the binding site is essentially saturated with an equimolar amount of the immunogen under the conditions employed.

The plots of In F versus t (time) were used (cf., Ref. 25) where F stands for the fraction of the unexchanged hydrogen (see Eqn. 1). Parallel first-order reactions (cf., Ref. 26) were assumed. The slope of the line through the plots at 48 and 72 h and its intercept at time zero were used to obtain a limiting value for the rate constants ( K m) and the sum of the amplitudes, respectively, for the slowest phases. To estimate the error, a line was fitted to the plots at 24, 48 and 72 h. The difference in the slope between this line and that above was used as an error of the rate constant. The error of the plot at 48 or 72 h, whichever greater, was used as an error of the amplitude. The error of the plot was based on the standard error of F (see Figs. 3 and 6).

Numbers of amide-lo,drogens per antigen-binding site of monoclonal antibodies 4-74-6 and 2-96-12 and the lab of monoclonal antibody 4-74-6 whose exchange is suppressed on binding to the immunogen
The number of amide-hydrogens per site whose exchange is suppressed on binding to the immunogen is calculated based on % exchanged hydrogens (Figs. 3, 5 and 6). It is assumed that the individual monoclonal antibodies and the Fab contain 1320 and 440 amino-acid residues, respectively (cf., Ref. 27). The concentration of the immunogen was 0.32 m M for all experiments. The concentration of the monoclonal antibody or the Fab was 0.32 m M with respect to the antigen-binding site in experiments 2, 3 and 4 and 0.22 m M in experiment 1.

Fig. 5. The exchange curve of amide-hydrogens of the Fab alone and those in the presence of deuterated yeast iso-1- and horse cytochrome c (one at a time) at p D 7.0. The Fab was prepared from mAb 4-74-6. The concentrations of the Fab and yeast iso-l- and horse cytochrome c were 0.32 mM. The values for A I I / A I are the averages of 2 experiments for all cases. The standard errors are shown by vertical bars. The other experimental details are described under Materials and Methods. (o), the Fab alone; ( ,x ). the Fab with yeast iso-l-cytochrome c; ( · ) . the Fab with horse cytochrome c.

Horse cytochrome c does not cross react with mAb 4-74-6 (see above). Being consistent, the amide-hydrogen exchange of this antibody was not significantly suppressed in the presence of excess deuterated horse cytochrome c (Fig. 3). The exchange curves of amide-hydrogens of mAb 4-128-6 in the presence and absence of the deuterated immunogen (Fig. 4) are qualitatively similar to those corresponding of mAb 4-74-6 (Fig. 3). The data of mAb 4-128-6 were based on a single spectral recording

at each time point, instead of repeated recordings (see the legend to Fig. 4) and therefore should be considered qualitative (see Materials and Methods). Addition of deuterated horse cytochrome c, instead of the immunogen, did not significantly suppress the amide-hydrogen exchange (Fig. 4). This is consistent with the fact that mAb 4-128-6 does not cross-react with horse cytochrome c (see above).

Amide-hydrogen exchange of the Fab of monoclonal antibody 4- 74-6
The suppression of hydrogen exchange in the presence of the immunogen was found to be distinctly greater for the Fab than for the parent molecule in terms of % hydrogen exchanged (Fig. 5). However, if the difference in the total number of amide-hydrogens between the parent molecule and the Fab is taken into account, a calculation shows that the differences in the number of unexchanged hydrogens per site between the presence and absence of the immunogen at 3 and 72 h are the same within errors between the Fab and the parent antibody (Table II). It follows that the immunogen-binding mainly suppresses the amide-hydrogen exchange of the Fab domains of the antibody, but not of the Fc. Addition of deuterated horse cytochrome c, instead of the deuterated immunogen, did not significantly suppress the hydrogen exchange of the Fab (Fig. 5).

Fig. 6. The exchange curve of amide-hydrogens of m A b 2-96-12 alone and those in the presence and absence of deuterated yeast iso-1, horse, tuna and bovine cytochrome c (one at a time) at p D 7.0. The concentration of the antibody was 0.16 m M and that of the antigens was 0.32 raM. The values for A I I / A I are the averages of 6 experiments for the antibody alone and that with tuna or bovine cytochrome c, 7 experiments for the antibody with horse cytochrome c and 5 experiments for that with yeast iso-l-cytochrome c. The standard errors are shown by vertical bars. The experimental details are described in Materials and Methods. In each of the three figures A, B, C, the same curves for the antibody alone ( o ) and that with yeast iso-l-cytochrome c (zx) are shown. In addition, the curves for the antibody with horse ( l ) , tuna (11) and bovine (11) cytochrome c, respectively, are shown in figures A, B and C.

99.4, 98.9 and 96.8% of the population of mAb 2-96-2 should have been bound with deuterated yeast iso-1, tuna, bovine and horse cytochromes c, respectively, under the conditions employed. The hydrogen exchange curves of mAb 2-96-12 in the presence and absence of the deuterated immunogen (Fig. 6 and Table I) are qualitatively similar to those of mAb 4-74-6 and 4-128-6. The exception is that the differences in the number of unexchanged amidehydrogens per site between the presence and absence of the immunogen are distinctly smaller for mAb 2-9612 than for mAb 4-74-6 at 72 h (Table II). This appears to be due mainly to the hydrogen exchange of mAb 2-96-12 being slower in the absence, but not in the presence, of the immunogen than mAb 4-74-6 (Figs. 3, 6 and Table I). A dramatic difference between mAb 2-96-12, on one hand, and the two other monoclonal antibodies on the other, was observed for the hydrogen-exchange curves in the presence of deuterated horse cytochrome c. The exchange curve of mAb 2-96-12 in the presence of deuterated horse cytochrome c is not distinguishable, within error, from that of the monoclonal antibody alone up to 6 h (Fig. 6A). Then, the former curve deviates from the latter and approaches the exchange curve of the antibody in the presence of deuterated yeast iso-1 cytochrome c more and more closely as time passes. As shown in Fig. 6B and C, it is remarkable that the exchange curves of the monoclonal antibody in the presence of deuterated tuna and bovine cytochromes c behave in a manner similar to that in the presence of deuterated horse cytochrome c (in the

case of tuna cytochrome c (Fig. 6B) such deviation of the curve is already apparent at 6 h). These observations indicate that there are two classes of amide-hydrogens of mAb 2-96-12. Of these, those which exchange faster exhibit the suppression of exchange only when the deuterated yeast iso-l-cytochrome c binds to the antibody but not when deuterated horse, tuna or bovine cytochrome c binds to it. * * On the other hand, those which exchange slower exhibit suppression of the exchange when any one of deuterated yeast iso-1, horse, tuna and bovine cytochromes c binds to the antibody. Estimated numbers of the former and latter classes of hydrogens, respec-

A m o n g the second-order rate constants for protein antigen-antibody reactions reported which include the cytochrome c -anti-cytochrome c reaction [28-30], the smallest is 4.1.105 M - l s -L [29]. If this value is used, a calculation shows that five half-lives of the reaction of the i m m u n o g e n with m A b 2-96-12 would be 0.236 s under the conditions employed. The equilibrium constants of tuna, bovine and horse cytochromes c with this antibody are smaller, up to 100-fold. than that of the i m m u n o g e n [3]. If this change of the affinity were accounted for solely by a change of the second-order rate constant, five half-lives of the reaction of horse cytochrome c, which exhibits the weakest affinity, would have been 24 s, based on the above calculation. However, this value could be an overestimate, since Levision et al. [31] have shown with the fluorescein-anti-fluorescein reaction that the rate of dissociation, but not association, largely determines the affinity. Based on the foregoing, it seems to be reasonable to assume that all the antigens used essentially saturate m A b 2-96-12 within the dead time (3 rain) of the measurements.

Discussion

SpecificiO' of the antigen-b&ding induced conformational stabilization
X-ray structures of 3 anti-lysozyme-Fab-lysozyme complexes [32-34] have shown that 14-18 residues of the antigen-binding site make close contact with the antigen. If the residues which are partially buried on binding to the antigen are included, a maximal number of residues which are shielded from solvent by the antigen, would be approx. 28 [34,35]. Taking into account the molecular weight of cytochrome c being approx. 80% of that of lysozyme, by analogy, binding of cytochrome c to a monoclonal anti-yeast iso-l-cytochrome c could shield up to 25 residues per site. Since horse, tuna and bovine cytochromes c compete with the immunogen for binding to mAb 2-96-12 [3], binding of any one of these evolutionarily related species to the monoclonal antibody is expected to shield essentially the same group of residues as that shielded by the immunogen. Addition of the immunogen suppressed the exchange of the amide-hydrogens of mAb 2-96-12 which exhibited faster as well as slower exchange rates (Fig. 6). Addition of the evolutionarily related species did not significantly suppress the exchange of amide-hydrogens of the antibody which exchanged faster (Fig. 6). However, it did suppress the exchange of hydrogens which exchanged slower (Fig. 6). These observations indicate that the amide-hydrogen exchange of this antibody is suppressed on antigen-binding by two different mechanisms; one specific for the immunogen and the other common for the immunogen and the evolutionarily related species. This immunogen-specific mechanism cannot be shielding of the residues. This is because the number of hydrogens (approx. 36 per site, Table I) whose exchange is suppressed, appears to be greater than a maximal number of the residues expected to be shielded. Furthermore, if it was due to residue shielding, the binding to the evolutionarily related species would also have suppressed the exchange of these hydrogens in the same manner. Based on a similar line of reasoning, the immunogen-specific mechanism cannot be suppression of exchange of the non-binding site hydrogens which would have exchanged only after dissociation of the antigen ***

Thus, this process of elimination leads to the idea that this antigen-specific mechanism is a kind of conformational stabilization of the antibody. Furthermore, the mechanism of this conformational stabilization must be specific in that the mechanism differentiates between the epitope of the deuterated immunogen, on one hand, and those of the deuterated evolutionarily related species on the other.

Possible influence of trans-interactions of the domains on amide-hydrogen exchange
While 10.2 + 0.6% amide-hydrogen of mAb 4-74-6 (in the absence of the immunogen) remained unexchanged after 72 h (Fig. 3), the unexchanged amide-hydrogen of the Fab was 12.2 + 0.4% after 72 h (Fig. 5). If it is assumed that this small, but apparently significant, difference is due to the amide-hydrogens of the Fc exchanging faster than those of the Fab, a calculation shows that 6.2 + 0.4% amide-hydrogens of the Fc would remain unexchanged after 72 h. This value is approximately half of that of the Fab (Fig. 5). Amzel and Poljak [27] have described, based on X-ray structures and physical chemical data [36,37], that trans-interactions of the Fc domains are much weaker than those of the Fab. Based on this, the above results may imply that the amide-hydrogens of the Fab exchange slower than those of the Fc, because the trans-interactions are stronger for the Fab than for the Fc. The suppression of amide-hydrogen exchange of mAb 2-96-12 common for binding to the evolutionarily related species and the immunogen manifests itself not in the earlier phase of the exchange kinetics, but in the later phase (Fig. 6). Therefore, the hydrogens involved in this phenomenon must exchange at a slower rate(s) in the absence of the antigen than the majority of amide-hydrogens. It is highly unlikely that all of the amide-hydrogens shielded by the antigen exchange at such a slower rate(s) in the absence of the antigen. The hydrogens that exchange at such a slower rate(s) are rather likely to belong to residues that constitute the hydrophobic cores of the Fab domains a n d / o r the domain-domain interface (cf., Ref. 27). Furthermore, the number of hydrogens whose exchange is suppressed at 72 h (approx. 37 per site, Table II) is greater than a maximal number of the residues expected to be shielded by the antigen. In view of this, it is interesting to speculate that the trans-interactions might be strengthened by binding with the antigen in such a way that the exchange of the slower exchanging hydrogens is suppressed. For example, Colman et al. [38] have suggested that antigenbinding might influence the VH-V L interface. Binding to the antigen could strengthen the trans-interactions by two mechanisms: first, by strengthening the group

* * * For example, some amide-hydrogens located in the interior of the binding site might exchange only after dissociation of the antigen. The amide-hydrogens located in the V L - V n interface might exchange only after disruption of the V k - V H contact and, therefore, after dissociation of the antigen.

177 interaction in the VH-VL, interface * and second, by forming a bridge between the V L and V H through, for example, antigen-VL and antigen-V H contacts. The second mechanism must occur by definition. This would prevent the VH-V L contact from being disrupted and, therefore, the amide-hydrogens in the VH-V L interface from being exposed to solvent. The first mechanism, if it occurs, could increase the stability of the V L and V H. This may, in turn, suppress the exchange of some amide-hydrogens such as those of residues constituting the cores of the V L and V H which could exchange without prior dissociation of the antigen. However, further studies such as those using residue substitution of the V H and V L are necessary to unequivocally determine which of the two mechanisms is responsible for the suppression of hydrogen exchange common for binding to the immunogen and evolutionarily related species *. change is suppressed on binding to the immunogen. Of these, those that exchange faster appear to be stabilized against exchange by the conformational stabilization which occurs by binding to the immunogen, but not to the evolutionarily related species. For the other class of hydrogens that exchange slower, the trans-interactions between the V H and V e may be important for modulating their exchange rate on binding to the antigen. Binding to the immunogen and to the evolutionarily related species similarly suppress the exchange of this class of hydrogens. Suppression of amide-hydrogen exchange by binding to the immunogen manifests itself in the earlier, as well as later phases of the exchange kinetics for all three monoclonal antibodies used and the Fab of mAb 4-74-6 (Figs. 3-6). This suggests, by analogy, that mAb 4-74-6, 4-128-6 and the Fab are also likely to contain the two classes of amide-hydrogens whose exchange is suppressed on binding to the immunogen, class 1 exchanging faster than class 2, and that the mechanism by which the exchange of class-1 hydrogens is suppressed is likely to be distinctly different from the mechanism for class 2. For example, the numbers of hydrogens of mAb 4-74-6 or the Fab, whose exchange is suppressed on binding to the immunogen at 3 and 72 h, respectively (Table II), may represent such class-1 and -2 hydrogens. Thus, the present studies are consistent with the idea that the antigen-antibody interaction is not confined to the antigen-antibody interface and that it may involve some long-range interaction with distant residues of the Fab.

Residue shielding
Shielding of residues must occur on antigen-binding [32-34]. However, it is not clear which phase of the exchange kinetics of mAb 2-96-12 in the presence of the immunogen is a manifestation of the residue shielding effect. Several factors can be considered to explain why the shielding effect could not be clearly identified. First, 25 per site may be an over estimate for the number of shielded residues. Second, not all of the shielded amide-hydrogens would exchange at the same rate. This would spread the shielding effect in different phases of the hydrogen-exchange. This would, in turn, reduce the difference in the number of hydrogens exchanged at a given time between the presence and absence of the antigen to a level undetectable by the present measurement (e.g., 8 or less). Third, some of the shielded hydrogens (e.g., those partially shielded) might exchange by partial unfolding of the monoclonal-antigen complex without dissociation. This would also spread the shielding effect in different phases of the exchange.

Concluding remarks
To explain suppression of hydrogen exchange of polyclonal antibodies by antigen-binding, residue shielding and conformational stabilization have been proposed previously [1,2,39-41]. The present studies have revealed a new aspect. There are two distinct classes of amide-hydrogens of mAb 2-96-12 whose ex-

It is not clear whether the trans-interactions between V H and V L are cooperative with those between C L and CH1. * In theory, it cannot be ruled out that some other kind of conformational stabilization, which is independent of the trans-interactions, is involved in this common suppression of the exchange.
