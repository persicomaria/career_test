The crystal structure of guanylate kinase (GK) from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with a non-acetylated N terminus has been determined in its unligated form (apo-GK) as well as in complex with GMP (GK Á GMP). The structure of apo-GK was solved with multiwavelength anomalous Ê diffraction data and re®ned to an R-factor of 0.164 (Rfree  0.199) at 2.3 A resolution. The structure of GK ÁGMP was determined using the crystal structure of GK with an acetylated N terminus as the search model and Ê re®ned to an R-factor of 0.156 (Rfree  0.245) at 1.9 A. GK belongs to the family of nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases and catalyzes the reversible phosphoryl transfer from ATP to GMP. Like other NMP kinases, GK consists of three dynamic domains: the CORE, LID, and NMP-binding domains. Dramatic movements of the GMP-binding domain and smaller but signi®cant movements of the LID domain have been revealed by comparing the structures of apo-GK and GK ÁGMP. apo-GK has a much more open conformation than the GK ÁGMP complex. Systematic analysis of the domain movements using the program DynDom shows that the large movements of the GMP-binding domain involve a rotation around an effective hinge axis approximately parallel with helix 3, which connects the GMP-binding and CORE domains. The C-terminal portion of helix 3, which connects to the CORE domain, has strikingly higher temperature factors in GK ÁGMP than in apo-GK, indicating that these residues become more mobile upon GMP binding. The results suggest that helix 3 plays an important role in domain movement. Unlike the GMP-binding domain, which moves toward the active center of the enzyme upon GMP binding, the LID domain moves away from the active center and makes the presumed ATP-binding site more open. Therefore, the LID domain movement may facilitate the binding of MgATP. The structure of the recombinant GK ÁGMP complex superimposes very well with that of the native GK ÁGMP complex, indicating that N-terminal acetylation does not have signi®cant impact on the threedimensional structure of GK.

(Gerstein et al., 1994). The so-called induced ®t plays important roles in enzymatic catalysis (Koshland, 1994), of which nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases are classic examples (Yan & Tsai, 1999). It has been suggested that the active centers of NMP kinases are assembled with large domain movements upon the binding of both subÈ strates (Muller-Dieckmann & Schulz, 1995). Substrate-induced conformational changes in NMP kinases were ®rst identi®ed by comparing the structures of various forms of homologous adenylate kinases (AKs) (Gerstein et al., 1993; Schulz et al., 1990). The analysis of 17 crystal structures of hom# 2001 Academic Press

248 ologous AKs resulted in the creation of a movie showing possible substrate-induced domain movements during the catalytic cycle (Vonrhein et al., 1995). Although comparison of the structures of homologous proteins is informative, precise analysis of the domain movements is not possible because of the complications of many sequence differences, including substitutions, insertions, and deletions (Yan & Tsai, 1999). Recently, the structures of different forms of cytidylate kinase (CK) and AK representing different stages of the catalytic cycle of NMP kinase have been reported, including an apo-CK and CK ÁCDP complex (Briozzo et al., 1998); and an apo-AK and AK ÁAp5A complex È (Muller et al., 1996). However, the pair of apostructure and binary complex with NMP has not been reported for any NMP kinase. Guanylate kinase (GK) catalyzes the reversible phosphoryl transfer from ATP to GMP in the presence of Mg2 (Agarwal et al., 1978; Li et al., 1996). GK plays important roles in the synthesis of nucleotide precursors and in the cGMP cycle (Hall & Kuhn, 1986). This enzyme may be involved in guanine nucleotide-mediated signal transduction pathways by regulating the GTP to GDP ratio (Woods & Bryant, 1991). Human GK is important in the activation of the anti-herpesvirus drugs acyclovir and gancyclovir (Boehme, 1984; Miller & Miller, 1980) and the anti-HIV agent carbovir (Miller et al., 1992). Like other NMP kinases, GK consists of three dynamic domains; the CORE, LID, and NMP-binding domains. GK is unique among NMP kinases, in that its NMP-binding domain consists of a four-stranded b-sheet and only a short helix, as revealed by X-ray crystallography (Stehle & Schulz, 1992), whereas the NMP-binding domains of other NMP kinases are all a-helical. Here, we present the crystal structures of unligated and GMP-bound forms of recombinant yeast GK. The recombinant GK produced by Escherichia

coli differs from the enzyme isolated from yeast, in that its N terminus is not acetylated, which has provided an opportunity to elucidate the structural consequences of N-terminal acetylation. Dramatic movements of the GMP-binding domain and smaller but signi®cant movements of the LID domain have been revealed by comparing the structures of recombinant apo-GK and GK ÁGMP. helix 3, which connects the CORE and GMP-binding domains, may play an important role in the dramatic domain movements. Structural comparison between the GMP complex of recombinant GK with that of the native enzyme shows that N-terminal acetylation does not have a signi®cant impact on the three-dimensional structure of GK.

Results
Quality of the structures apo-GK crystallized in the trigonal space group P31 with two independent molecules, Mol A and Mol B, in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). We solved the crystal structure by using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) technique (Table 2) (Hendrickson & Ogata, 1997). The experimental electron density map from MAD phasing was of very high quality (Figure 1(a)). The ®nal structure of apo-GK consists of two polypeptide chains and 424 water molecules. The crystallographic R-factor is 0.164 for re¯ections with I 5 2s(I) within the Ê resolution range 20.0 to 2.3 A (Table 3). The accuracy of the atomic coordinates versus the resolution, as derived from the Luzzati plot (Luzzati, Ê 1952), is $0.18 A. All main-chain dihedral angles are found in favorable regions on the Ramachandran plot (Laskowski et al., 1993) (Table 3). All atoms have well-de®ned electron density, except for the side-chains of solvent-exposed residues Lys59, Lys90, and Glu133 in Mol B and residues located on the loop within the LID domain of both molecules (residues 138 to 140 in Mol A and 135 to 137 in Mol B). Water oxygen atoms are also well

All atoms have well-de®ned electron density.

Differences between Mol A and Mol B of apo-GK GK has been suggested to be composed of three dynamic domains on the basis of the structural comparison with AK (Stehle & Schulz, 1992). The CORE domain of GK contains a central, ®vestranded, parallel b-sheet (b9, b8, b1, b7 and b2) and six a-helices (a1, a3, a4, a5, a6 and a7). The NMP-binding domain is composed of a fourstranded b-sheet (b5, b6, b3 and b4) and one a-helix (a2). The LID domain consists of only one loop, which connects a5 and a6 and contains seven residues (135-141). These domains are dynamic, de®ned by groups of residues moving in a concerted fashion. Although the superposition of Mol A and Mol B, using all 186 pairs of Ca atoms, shows a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of Ê 1.20 A, the single domains of the two molecules

superimpose very well (Table 4). Figure 1(b) shows the best alignment of the CORE and LID domains of Mol A and Mol B, which reveals the signi®cant displacement of the NMP-binding domain. Mol B is more open than Mol A. The largest distance Ê between the Ca positions is 4.1 A for the displacement of Ala42 (Figure 1(b)). Therefore, the conformational difference between Mol A and Mol B of the apo-GK structure is the result of a ``rigidbody'' movement of the GMP-binding domain relative to the CORE and LID domains. Figure 1(c) depicts the conformational differences of the N and C-terminal residues in Mol A and Mol B. The differences are partially due to crystal packing. Despite the conformational differences, however,

the N and C termini interact with each other via salt link(s) between the Arg2 side-chain and Cterminal carboxyl group and the hydrogen bond(s) between the Ser1 amide Og and Glu185 side-chain (Figure 1(c)). Such interactions probably play a role in the stabilization of the N and C termini. GMP-binding-induced domain movements in GK GMP binding induces dramatic conformational changes in GK (Figure 2). Although the rmsd of all 186 pairs of Ca positions between apo-GK (Mol A or Mol B) and GK ÁGMP is quite large, the domaindomain alignment between the apo and GMP-

The illustration was generated with BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997) and RASTER3D (Merritt & Bacon, 1997).

bound forms is similar to that between the two apo-GK molecules (Table 4). The superposition of apo-Mol A, apo-Mol B, and GK ÁGMP is illustrated in Figure 2, where the alignment was optimized for the Ca atoms of the CORE domain in the three structures (Table 4). A dramatic rigid-body domain displacement of the whole NMP-binding domain is revealed, which can be indicated quantitatively by the shift of the Ca position of Ala42. Residue Ala42 is located in the loop between b3 and b4, and near the C-terminal end of b3 (Figure 2). The Ca-Ca Ê distance of Ala42 is 17.2 A between apo-Mol A Ê and GK ÁGMP, and 20.2 A between apo-Mol B and GK Á GMP. The shift of the LID domain, containing only seven residues, among the three conformations is much smaller (Figure 2). The largest dis-

Ê placement of the LID domain is 2.8 A between Ê between apo-Mol A and GK ÁGMP and 3.5 A apo-Mol B and GK Á GMP, as measured by the positions of the corresponding Ca atoms. Interestingly, whereas the NMP-binding domain moves toward the CORE domain upon binding of GMP, the LID domain moves away from the CORE domain. We analyzed the domain movements further by using the program DynDom (Hayward & Berendsen, 1998). This program was designed to identify dynamic domains by clusters of rotation vectors of main-chain segments and has been used to determine the dynamic domains of E. coli AK with a larger LID domain (37 residues) (Hayward, 1999). Although DynDom has been used to determine the three dynamic domains of E. coli AK,

interactions that are involved in GMP binding, six interactions involving ®ve of the eight polar residues at the GMP-binding site have displacements Ê that are greater than 1 A. Arg41 and Asp100 have Ê the largest displacements; 6.0 A for Arg41 and Ê 5.3 A for Asp100, as measured by the corresponding atoms of apo-Mol B and GK Á GMP. Sitedirected mutagenesis studies have shown that Arg41 plays a critical role in transition state stabilization and Asp100 is involved in both GMP binding and transition state stabilization (Y.L. et al., unpublished results). The changes in mobility upon GMP binding are more complicated, as judged by the main-chain temperature factors (Figure 5). Some changes in the temperature factors are probably due to crystal-packing interactions. The average temperature factor of GK ÁGMP is lower than that of apo-Mol A or apo-Mol B, suggesting that, overall, GMP-bound GK has less internal motion than unligated GK. However, residues 84 to 93, which are involved in the interdomain motion, have strikingly higher temperature factors in GK Á GMP than in apo-Mol A and apo-Mol B, indicating that these residues become more mobile upon GMP binding. Structural consequences of N-terminal acetylation N-terminal acetylation is one of the most frequent modi®cations of proteins in eukaryotes (Augen & Wold, 1986; Driessen et al., 1985). A large number of proteins isolated from eukaryotes have an acetylated N terminus, whereas the N termini of recombinant eukaryotic proteins produced in E. coli are generally not acetylated. It has been proposed that N-terminal acetylation protects proteins from degradation by the ubiquitin-mediated pathway (Bachmair et al., 1986) and is required for the binding of tropomyosin to actin (Urbancikova & Hitchcock-DeGregori, 1994) as well as the binding cooperativity of S-adenosylmethionine with glycine N-methyltransferase (Ogawa et al., 1997). However, the structural consequences of N-terminal acetylation are largely unknown. Because the N terminus of yeast GK isolated from the natural source is acetylated but that of recombinant GK produced in E. coli is not, the determination of the crystal structure of the recombinant GK in complex with GMP has provided us with an ideal case for elucidating the structural consequences of N-terminal acetylation. The symmetry and structure of the GMP-complex of recombinant GK with a non-acetylated N terminus (this work) are almost identical with those of the native protein with an acetylated N terminus (Stehle & Schulz, 1992) (Figure 6(a)). The optimized alignment of the two GK Á GMP structures with 183 (from a total of 186) pairs of Ca Ê atoms results in an rmsd of 0.16 A. The three excluded Ca positions are 1, 90, and 186. Residues 1 and 186 are the N and C termini, respectively. Position 90 is occupied by a lysine residue on the

The CORE and LID domains are blue, the GMP-binding domain is red, and the residues that are involved in the interdomain motions are green. The long black arrow is the effective hinge axis, with the arrow indicating direction of the rotation of the GMP-binding domain by the right-hand rule (Hayward & Berendsen, 1998).

only two dynamic domains were identi®ed for GK (Figure 3), presumably because the LID domain of GK is too small (seven residues) for such analysis. The ratio of interdomain to intradomain displacement is 2.2 for Mol A and 2.5 for Mol B. The movement of the NMP-binding domain can be described as rotation around an effective hinge axis (®lled arrow, Figure 3) for both Mol A and Mol B with minimal translational movements. The effective hinge axes for both molecules are parallel with helix 3, which consists of residues 83 to 91. The angles of rotation are 41  and 47  for Mol A and Mol B, respectively. Residues 33 to 34 and 84 to 93 (in green, Figure 3) are involved in the interdomain movement of both Mol A and Mol B. It is apparent that the GMP-binding site is completely assembled only upon binding of GMP. Figure 4 shows the superposition of the GMP-binding sites of apo-Mol A, apo-Mol B, and GK ÁGMP optimized for the Ca atoms of the GMP-binding domains of the three structures. Of the 11 polar

surface of the molecule (Figure 6(a)). Residue 1 in both structures does not have signi®cant electrostatic interactions with symmetry-related molecules in the crystal lattice. However, this residue forms a hydrogen bond in both proteins with the sidechain oxygen atom of Thr94 (Figure 6(b)). In recombinant GK, Thr94 interacts with Og of Ser1 Ê and the hydrogen bond distance is 3.19 A, whereas in the native GK, Thr94 interacts with the carbonyl oxygen atom of the acetyl group and the hydrogen Ê bond distance is 2.78 A. This difference is signi®cant, suggesting a stronger interaction between the N terminus and Thr94 in the native GK, which may be important for the stability of the molecule. Comparison of the two high-resolution crystal structures clearly indicates that N-terminal acetylation, in the case of GK, has no signi®cant impact on the three-dimensional structure of the protein.

Discussion
Large domain movements in NMP kinases have been revealed by comparing the structures of homologous proteins in various ligated forms representing different stages of the catalytic cycle (Vonrhein et al., 1995). However, precise analysis of the domain movements is not possible because of many substitutions, insertions and deletions in the amino acid sequences of the proteins. Thus, a pair of the structures of the same enzyme, one unligated and the other complexed with ATP or NMP, is needed to precisely determine the domain movements induced by ATP or NMP. To elucidate the domain movements in GK, we have determined the crystal structures of the unligated recombinant GK and its complex with GMP, making it possible for the ®rst time to analyze in detail the NMPinduced domain movements in an NMP kinase. As expected, binding of GMP induces large movements of the GMP-binding domain in GK. Systematic analysis of the domain movements by using the program DynDom (Hayward &

Berendsen, 1998) shows that the large domain movements in GK involve the rotation around an effective hinge axis approximately parallel with helix 3, which connects the GMP-binding and CORE domains. The rotation of helix 3 also alters the interactions between the helix and the CORE domain. Helix 3 is amphipathic with Val82, Val85 and Val88 forming the hydrophobic side. In apoGK, the three valine residues of helix 3 has about ten favorable van der Waals (vdw) contacts with the CORE domain. Most of the vdw contacts are lost upon GMP binding, because of the domain rotation. Only Val88, which is near the C terminus of the helix, has a few favorable vdw contacts with the CORE domain. GMP binding induces a signi®cant increase in the mobility of the C-terminal portion of helix 3. The binding of Ap5A, a bisubstrate analog for AK, induces a very similar change in the mobility of the helix that connects the AMPÈ binding and CORE domains in E. coli AK (Muller et al., 1996). The increased mobility at the C-terminal portion of helix 3 is unlikely due to the loss of

the vdw contacts between the helix and the CORE domain, because most of the vdw contacts between the C-terminal portion of the helix and the CORE domain remain upon GMP binding. It is the Nterminal portion of the helix that loses its contacts with the CORE domain. We propose that helix 3 in GK acts like a spring in the movements of the GMP-binding domain. The rotation of the GMPbinding domain around the effective hinge axis upon GMP binding exerts a force that acts to unwind the helix. However, the helix is still intact. Instead, this force causes a rotation of the helix and creates a tension at the C-terminal portion of the helix, which makes this peptide segment more mobile. This increased mobility may persist È through the ternary complex, as observed by MulÈ ler and co-workers (Muller et al., 1996) in their crystallographic study of E. coli AK, which has shown that, upon substrate binding, the enzyme increases its chain mobility in a region remote from the active site, and this region ``solidi®es'' again on substrate release. This region is therefore proposed to serve as a ``counterweight'' that prevents the ternary complex from dropping into an È energy well (Muller et al., 1996). Similarly, the increased mobility of helix 3 in GK may facilitate

the release of the products and the return of the enzyme to the unligated form. In addition to the large movements of the GMPbinding domain, GMP binding also induces small but signi®cant movements of the LID domain. Unlike the GMP-binding domain, which moves toward the active center of the enzyme upon GMP binding, the LID domain moves away from the active center and renders the active center more open. The domain movement may be functionally important, because it may facilitate the binding of MgATP. The movement of the GMP-binding domain induced by GMP binding in GK is similar to that of the AMP-binding domain induced by AMP binding in AK, as suggested by the results of ¯uorescence spectroscopic experiments. Using the method of time-resolved energy transfer, Sinev and co-workers have measured the distances of pairs of ¯uorescence donors and acceptors attached to residues 169 and 55 of E. coli AK (Sinev et al., 1996a). Residue 169 is located at the CORE domain of E. coli AK, whereas residue 55 is at the NMP-binding domain. Upon AMP binding, the distance between the donor and acceptor attached to resiÊ dues 169 and 55 is shortened by 12 to 20 A, and

was 100 % mineral oil (light white; Sigma M3516). The Ê crystal diffracted to 2.3 A resolution. Data processing was carried out with the HKL2000 program suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The statistics of diffraction data can be found in Table 1. Many attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement (Rossman, 1972) did not result in any meaningful solution, due to the dramatic domain shift discussed above. Subsequent trials using multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR, Green et al., 1954) failed as well because of the non-isomorphism between native and derivative crystals. Nonisomorphism was evident also among native crystals. MAD phasing of apo-GK The crystal structure of apo-GK was solved using the MAD data collected from a mercuric derivative, which was prepared by soaking the native crystals at room temperature for 24 hours in the crystallization reservoir solution with an additional 10-20 mM ethyl mercuric phosphate. The HgMAD data were collected at beamline X9B with a Quantum-4 CCD detector at cryogenic temperature (100 K) maintained with an Oxford cryosystem. Mineral oil was used as the cryoprotectant. Four wavelengths near the Hg absorption edge were selected. The Ê Hg-derivative crystal diffracted to 2.7 A. X-ray data were processed using HKL2000 (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) (Table 2). Two Hg sites with full occupancies and reasonable temperature factors were found using the program SOLVE (Terwilliger & Berendzen, 1999). A pseudo-MIR approach (Ramakrishnan & Biou, 1997) embedded in PHASES (Furey & Swaminathan, 1997) was then employed to re®ne the positional parameters of Hg sites and calculate the phase angles. Remote wavelength (l3) was used as ``native'' and other wavelengths were used as ``derivatives'' (Table 2). The resulting phases were improved with a density modi®cation (DM) procedure (Cowtan, 1994). The phase improvement was also carried out with the SHARP package (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997), which resulted in an experimental electron density map of a very high quality (Figure 1(a)). Tracing and model adjustment were carried out with the graphics package O (Jones et al., 1991). Structure refinement of apo-GK The structure was initially re®ned with X-PLOR È (Brunger & Rice, 1997) for data in the resolution range Ê 8.0 to 2.3 A. The ®rst rigid-body re®nement resulted in Rfree and R-factor values of 0.423 and 0.351, respectively (5 % data were used for Rfree calculations, Table 3). Strong non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints for the two independent molecules were used with the simulated annealing procedure. The NCS restraints, initially applied globally for the whole molecule, were applied to individual domains, and then only to mainchain atoms. After each round of re®nement, the model was inspected with 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps. Eleven rounds of re®nement were done using the simulated È annealing procedure of X-PLOR (Brunger & Rice, 1997). Further model adjustment involved correcting errors in side-chain conformation and locating solvent molecules. Final re®nement was done with SHELXL-97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997) for X-ray data within the resolution Ê range 20.0 to 2.3 A. The NCS restraints were then removed. The ®nal Rfree and R-factor values were 0.199 and 0.164, respectively (Table 3). The difference electron density map did not show any more interpretable fea-

accordingly, the calculated distance between the Ca atoms of residues 169 and 55 is shortened by Ê 7.4 A. Certainly, the NMP-binding domains in both enzymes move toward their respective active centers, but the magnitude of the movement appears to be much larger in GK. The ¯uorescence measurements have shown the presence of multiple conformations of E. coli AK in solution. It is likely that apo-GK also has multiple conformations in solution, and that the two crystallographically independent molecules of apo-GK (Mol A and Mol B) represent separate snapshots of a range of conformations. The movement of the LID domain induced by GMP binding in GK is quite different from that induced by AMP in AK. Regardless of the size of the LID domain in GK (seven residues) and that in AK (38 residues), the direction of NMP-induced LID-domain movement in GK is not as expected, whereas that in AK is as expected. The movement of the LID domain in AK has been studied by measuring the distances of pairs of ¯uorescence donors and acceptors attached to residue 73 at the CORE domain and residue 142 at the LID domain of E. coli AK (Sinev et al., 1996b). The distances between the donors and acceptors attached to resiÊ dues 73 and 142 are shortened by $9 A upon AMP binding, indicating a closure of the LID domain in response to the binding of AMP. In contrast, binding of GMP to GK causes the LID domain to move away from the active center of the enzyme (Figure 2), which makes the presumed ATP-binding site more open and therefore may facilitate the binding of MgATP.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification Recombinant yeast GK (without the N-terminal acetyl group) was produced in E. coli by using the vector pET-17b and puri®ed as described (Li et al., 1996). Pure, concentrated GK was dialyzed to remove the buffer components and lyophilized. The same protein was used to crystallize the unligated form and the GK Á GMP complex. Crystallization and X-ray data collection of apo-GK The crystals of apo-GK were grown in hanging drops at well-controlled room temperature. The protein was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) and concentrated at 4  C. The protein solution contained 14 mg/ml GK in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0); the reservoir solution contained 30 % (w/v) PEG4000 and 0.3 M sodium acetate in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The drops contained equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions. The crystals appeared within one week and after two more weeks they reached the maximal size of 1.20 mm Â 0.15 mm Â 0.15 mm. Detailed crystal data are presented in Table 1. The native data set was collected from a single crystal at 100 K using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector mounted at synchrotron beamline X9B of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory.

tures. The ®nal structure consisted of all non-hydrogen atoms of both independent polypeptide chains (372 residues total) and 424 water molecules. The ®nal rmsd values for bond lengths and angle distances were 0.004 Ê and 0.017 A, respectively. The structure was assessed using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), and showed that 91.2 % of the residues were in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 3). Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination of GK ÁGMP Crystals of GK Á GMP were grown at well-controlled room temperature (20(Æ1)  C) in hanging drops under conditions slightly different from those used by Stehle & Schulz (1992). The protein stock solution contained 15 mg/ml GK and 10 mM GMP in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0); the reservoir solution contained 2.0 M ammonium sulfate in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5). The drops contained equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions. The tetragonal bipyramid crystals appeared after one week and grew to the ®nal dimensions of 0.35 mm Â 0.35 mm Â 0.55 mm after two more weeks. Symmetry, unit cell dimensions, and solvent content are presented in Table 1. The data set was collected from a single crystal at room temperature, using a Rigaku rotating anode operated at 50 kV and 100 mA with a 30 cm MarResearch image plate. Data processing was carried out with HKL2000 (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The statistics of X-ray data are summarized in Table 1. The starting model for the re®nement of GK ÁGMP Ê was the 2.0 A structure (Stehle & Schulz, 1992) without GMP, the N-terminal acetyl group, and solvent molecules. This structure was initially re®ned with X-PLOR È (Brunger & Rice, 1997) for data in the resolution range Ê 8.0 to 1.9 A. Final re®nement was done with SHELXL-97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997) for X-ray data within the Ê resolution range 15.0 to 1.9 A. The ®nal Rfree and R-factor values were 0.245 and 0.156, respectively. The ®nal structure consists of all non-hydrogen atoms of the polypeptide chain, one GMP molecule, two sulfate ions, and 208 water molecules. The difference electron density map did not show any more interpretable features. The rmsd values for bond lengths and angle distances were 0.010 Ê and 0.033 A, respectively (Table 3). Domain analysis The domain movements of GK were analyzed by using the program DynDom (Hayward & Berendsen, 1998). A sliding window of ®ve residues was used in the analysis. The minimum value for the ratio of interdomain to intradomain displacement was set to 1, and the minimum domain size was ten residues. Accession numbers The coordinates and structure factors of apo-GK and GK Á GMP have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank and the accession codes are 1EX6 and 1EX7, respectively.
