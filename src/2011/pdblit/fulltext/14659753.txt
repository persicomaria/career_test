Background: The 26S proteasome is the central protease of the ubiquitin-dependent pathway of protein degradation. The proteolytic core of the complex is formed by the 20S proteasome, a cylinder-shaped particle that in archaebacteria contains two different subunits ( and 3) and in eukaryotes contains fourteen different subunits (seven of the a-type and seven of the 3 -type). Results: We have purified a 20S proteasome complex from the nocardioform actinomycete Rhodococcus sp. strain NI86/21. The complex has an apparent relative molecular mass of 690 kD, and efficiently degrades the

chymotryptic substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC in the presence or absence of 0.05 % SDS. Purified preparations reveal the existence of four subunits, two of the a-type and two of the 3-type, the genes for which we have cloned and sequenced. Electron micrographs show that the complex has the four-ringed, cylinder-shaped appearance typical of proteasomes. Conclusions: The recent description of the first eubacterial ubiquitin, and our discovery of a eubacterial proteasome show that the ubiquitin pathway of protein degradation is ancestral and common to all forms of life.

Background
Proteasomes are ubiquitous multisubunit proteases of eukaryotic organisms. The 26S proteasome is the central protease of the ubiquitin-dependent pathway of protein degradation [1-4] and plays a key role in many cellular processes including the cell cycle [5,6], transcriptional regulation [7,8] and antigen presentation [9]. The protein is formed by two, asymmetric, 19S cap complexes attached to the ends of a barrel-shaped 20S particle [10]. The 20S particle, generally referred to as the multicatalytic proteinase or 20S proteasome, consists of four seven-membered rings that contain fourteen related but different subunits [11,12]. These fall into two families, with oa-type subunits forming the outer rings and 13-type subunits the inner rings of the complex. Until their discovery in the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum [13], proteasomes were thought to occur exclusively in eukaryotes. Following this discovery, searches were made for proteasomes in other archaebacteria and in eubacteria without success [14], leading to speculation that a Thermoplasma-like organism may have been the precursor of the eukaryotic cytosol. Although structurally indistinguishable from eukaryotic proteasomes at a resolution of 2 nm, the proteasome of Thermoplasma is much simpler, being formed of only two subunits, a and [3 [13]. This simplicity has allowed the determination of the structure of the Thermoplasma

proteasome at 3.4 A resolution [15,16] and the identification of its catalytic nucleophile, a threonine residue (PThrl) of the 13 subunit [16-18]. Recently, a scan of the GenBank database revealed the existence of several proteins from eubacteria with sequences that show significant similarity to those of proteasome -type subunits [19]. Although most of them occur in an operon with a ClpX-related ATPase, and may form structures more similar to the Clp protease than to proteasomes, one protein, from Mycobacterium leprae, is significantly more similar to the Thermoplasma subunit and may form a true proteasome. In this article, we report the discovery, purification and characterization of a 20S proteasome complex from a nocardioform actinomycete, Rhodococcus sp. strain NI86/21, that is closely related to Mycobacterium. This discovery extends the occurrence of proteasomes to the third kingdom and shows that the proteasome is an ancestral particle of universal distribution.

Characterization of a eubacterial proteasome Tamura et al. Characterization of a eubacterial proteasome Tamura et al. atrazine [20,21], four open reading frames (ORFs) were identified downstream of thcR (Fig. la). One of the encoded proteins, PrcB, is clearly related to proteasomal 3-type subunits, and a second, PrcA, shows a similarity of unclear statistical significance to or-type subunits. Database searches revealed a region with a strikingly similar gene organization in the genome of the related nocardioform actinomycete Mycobacterium leprae (Collaborative Research Inc., GenBank accession U00017; Fig. 1c). The similarity between the regions is highly significant at the protein level (61-81 % sequence identity), the main difference being a large amino-terminal deletion in Rhodococcus Orf6 relative to Mycobacterium C1_172. At the DNA level, similarities include a putative ribosomebinding site found in front of the start codons of orf7 (AAGGAGG) and oX (AGGAGG), the unusual GUG start codon of prcB, and the apparent translational coupling of the of7-prcB-prcA and ofx-prcB-C3_260 genes, as inferred from the two-base overlaps of the stop and start codons of the gene pairs orf7/odX-prcB and prcB-prcA/C3_260 (data not shown). Purification and biochemical characterization of a 20S proteasome complex In order to isolate the proteasome complex from Rhodococcus, we tested the hydrolyzing activity of crude cell-extract fractions using the substrate Suc-Leu-LeuVal-Tyr-AMC, which is a typical fluorigenic substrate for chymotrypsin-like activity. Previous studies had shown that low concentrations of SDS do not affect the chymotryptic activity of proteasomes from Thermoplasma (unpublished data) and indeed activate the chymotryptic activity of most eukaryotic proteasomes [22,23]. We subjected crude cell extracts of Rhodococcus to gel filtration

chromatography on Sepharose 6B (Fig. 2a) and tested the eluted fractions for Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMChydrolyzing activity in the presence and absence of 0.05 % SDS. Two peaks of activity, eluting at apparent molecular masses of 500-700 kD and 200-300 kD, were obtained in the absence of SDS. In the presence of SDS, the low molecular weight fraction lost all activity, whereas the high molecular weight fraction showed no change of activity, indicating that it may contain proteasomes. We

therefore subjected this fraction to further purification using a sequence of conventional chromatography steps. The putative Rlhodococcus proteasome was purified to over 95 % homogeneity by the method outlined in Table 1. The overall purification was approximately 440-fold, and the yield was 46 %. The native molecular mass of the particle was estimated to be approximately 690 kD by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) (Fig. 2c). The substrate specificity of the particle was similar to that of the archaebacterial proteasome [24] and showed high activity against the chymotryptic substrates Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC and Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-AMC, but no tryptic or peptidyl-glutamyl-peptidase activities (Table 2). Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (TricineSDS-PAGE) of the putative proteasome yielded four bands of similar intensity with estimated molecular weights of 31 kD, 29 kD, 25 kD and 24 kD (Fig. 2b). This was a surprising result, as the Thernioplasnma proteasome is formed by only two subunits ( and A), whereas eukaryotic proteasomes are formed by fourteen subunits (seven of the oa-type and seven of the P-type). The four bands were blotted and their amino-terminal sequences

were determined by Edman degradation. Internal sequence information was obtained by digesting each band in situ using Lys-C, separating the products by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and subjecting them to Edman degradation. The 31 kD and 29 kD bands were amino-terminally blocked. Two internal peptide sequences from the 31 kD band were found to be identical to sequences encoded by the prcA gene, whereas four internal sequences from the 29 kD band, covering about a third of the protein, were found to be related but nonidentical to the prcA gene product (Fig. 3). We concluded that the two proteins did not arise from one precursor by posttranslational processing, but were the products of different genes. We also concluded that both proteins, which we named al (31 kD) and oa2 (29 kD), were a-type subunits and that the 31 kD band corresponded to the prcA gene product. Thus the two 0a-type subunits of the Rlhodococcus proteasome are similar to oa-type subunits from eukaryotes and archaebacteria, which are also blocked at their amino termini. The two other bands had amino-terminal sequences of TTIVAISY (25 kD band) and TTIVALTYKG (24 kD band). The amino-terminal sequence of the 24 kD band corresponded to a sequence encoded by the prcB gene, whereas the amino-terminal sequence of the 25 kD band, as well as three other internal sequences, were similar, but not identical, to the prcB gene product (Fig. 3). As in the case of the two o-type subunits, we concluded that the two proteins were encoded by different genes, that they were both P-type subunits and that the 24 kD protein corresponded to the prcB gene product. In addition, we also concluded that 11 and B2 contain a pro-peptide that is cleaved during the assembly of the proteasome. The proteolytically active P-type subunits of eukaryotes and archaebacteria also contain a pro-peptide that is cleaved at a conserved threonine. This threonine is the catalytically active nucleophile and its free amino group may be important for catalysis as a proton acceptor/donor [16,18]. In an immunological cross-reactivity test of the Rllodococcus proteasome subunits with antibodies raised against the ao subunit, the e subunit or the entire proteasome complex from Tlermoplasma, no cross-reactivity was obtained as judged by western immunoblotting after Tricine-SDSPAGE (data not shown). This result is not unexpected

The arrow shows the site of proteolytic processing inthe a subunits. given the large sequence divergence between the proteasome subunits of Rhodococcus and Thermoplasma. Cloning and sequencing of a second operon containing proteasome-related genes Following the discovery of two a and two , subunits in Rhodococcus, we searched for a second operon of proteasome-related genes by hybridization of total DNA preparations with an internal prcA probe. We identified a second gene region (Fig. lb) with an organization strikingly similar to the regions identified previously in Rhodococcus (Fig. la) and Mycobacterium (Fig. 1c). We named the genes in this region, which code for subunits cx2 and 2, orf62 -otf7 2-prcB2 -prcA2 , and renamed the two prc genes of the initially identified region prcA and prcB l, as they code for subunits cxl and 31. We were surprised to find that the homologous proteins in Rhodococcus are all more similar to each other than to the equivalent proteins in Mycobacterium (Fig. 4a), at both the protein and the DNA level. This indicates that the gene duplication in Rhodococcus occurred very recently on an evolutionary timescale, and that it is unlikely, therefore, to represent a general feature of eubacterial proteasomes. The second region of Rhodococcus proteasome genes had a GC content (63 %) intermediate between that of the first region (67 %) and of the region from Mycobacterium (59 %), and an orf6-homologue (orf62) of the same length as Mycobacterium C1_172. Further similarities to the two other proteasome gene regions included a putative ribosome-binding site in front of orf72 , a GUG start codon for prcB2, and two-base overlaps in the coding regions of orf72, prcB2 and prcA2.

(Fig. 5). Correlation averages of the latter show that, as in Thermoplasma, the Rhodococcus proteasome is a stack of four rings collectively forming a barrel-shaped structure (Fig. 5, inset). Because of the difficulties in assigning symmetry based on projection images of large negatively stained molecules [25], we are unable at this point to determine whether the rings are composed of six or seven members. Discussion Sequence analysis and phylogeny Despite their significant divergence, the subunits of the eubacterial proteasome are clearly related to or-type and 3-type proteasomal subunits. Together with PrcB of Mycobacterium, 31 and 32 can be assigned unambiguously to the family of 13-type subunits on the basis of sequence similarity. The similarity of aol, a2 and Mycobacterium C3_260 to at-type subunits is more difficult to establish from sequence data, and only two sequence blocks, corresponding to residues 23-52 and 130-143 in Thermoplasma or, can be aligned significantly with other a subunits. Nevertheless, the biochemical data and the occurrence of a few highly conserved residues indicate that they are true a subunits and will assume the same basic fold as all other a-type and 3-type subunits. Based on these highly conserved residues and on the predicted secondary structure, we have constructed the alignment presented in Figure 6. The first region of significant similarity in a-type subunits (residues 23-52) encompasses a helix that is highly conserved between eukaryotic and Thermoplasma at sequences, but is less conserved in eubacterial subunits. This helix lies on the top outer surface of a rings [16] and probably interacts with regulatory factors such as the 19S cap (PA700) or the 11S regulator (PA28); its conservation indicates that these factors may be equally universal in occurrence despite the fact that they have only been detected, so far, in

eukaryotes. The second very highly conserved region in a-type subunits (residues 130-143) contains an invariant RPXG motif (in which X represents a large hydrophobic residue). This sequence is part of a loop that constricts the central pore through which unfolded polypeptides penetrate into the inner proteolytic compartment [16,26]. In Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium, the equivalent sequence is KPYE and the loop is similar in size to other a subunits, indicating that the pore has similar properties and dimensions. In [3-type subunits, several residues critical to the shape and nature of the active site are conserved between 31, 132 and other proteasome subunits. Most important is residue Thrl of mature subunits, which provides the catalytic nucleophile [16,18]. The amino-terminal group of this residue is freed by cleavage of a pro-peptide in three of the seven eukaryotic 3-subunit types and in Thermoplasma 13 during assembly of the complex. The four other eukaryotic 3-subunit types do not contain this threonine and/or are not cleaved at this site, indicating that they are proteolytically inactive. Both Rhodococcus 3-type subunits are cleaved at this internal threonine, resulting in the release of pro-peptides of 65 (31) and 59 (P32) residues. The presumed role of the free amino terminus of Thrl is to provide a proton acceptor/donor Fig. 6.

The upper part of the alignment shows a-type subunits and the lower part 1-type subunits. Eukaryotic members are represented by human sequences where known; the 3-type sequences are shown in their mature form (where known) and include the MHCencoded inducible subunits LMP2 and LMP7 which can replace the constitutive subunits and upon y-interferon stimulation.

Current Biology 1995, Vol 5 No 7 function for the initial nucleophilic attack, analogous to the amino terminus of the catalytic serine in penicillin acylase [27]. A second highly conserved residue in the active site is Lys33, which is conserved throughout all catalytically active subunits, including all eubacterial 3-type subunits. Lys33 forms a salt-bridge to 3Asp17 [16], and this residue is equally conserved in all eubacterial 3-type subunits. Finally, two glycine-rich loops (GSG, residues 130-132, and SGG, residues 170-172) that are conserved in all active [3-type subunits (but not in inactive 3-type subunits) and that frame the active site [16] are also conserved in 31,.132 and PrcB as GSG and TGG. A distance-based dendrogram of proteasome sequences subunits of Rhodococcus and of (Fig. 4b) shows that the 13 Mycobacterium form a common branch that originates close to the root of 1-type sequences. The two proteins are clearly more closely related to the active than to the inactive subunits of eukaryotes. As discussed previously [12], the shape of the dendrogram is dependent on details of the alignment, on the choice of scoring matrix and on other evolutionary assumptions. The main difference between this tree and similar trees published previously [12,19] is the fact that PrcB was considered part of the eubacterial HslV branch prior to the inclusion of a fairly divergent ORF sequence from Alcaligenes eutrophus. Inclusion of this sequence shifted PrcB out of the eubacterial HslV branch and moved this branch closer to the root. Evidently, this tree must be viewed as provisional and likely to change in its bacterial branches with the addition of further sequences. Only minor changes are likely to occur in the eukaryotic branches. Models for the oligomeric structure of the Rhodococcus proteasome Several models can be imagined that account for the increased subunit complexity of the eubacterial proteasome relative to the archaebacterial one. The simplest model is that of two proteasome populations in Rhodococcus - one formed by oil and 31, the other by 2 and 132 (Fig. 7a) - although it would then be a surprising coincidence that we would obtain approximately equal amounts of both complexes during purification. Two other models incorporate equimolar amounts of each subunit into the complex, either by proposing four different homo-oligomeric rings per particle (Fig. 7b), or two hetero-oligomeric rings of each type (Fig. 7c). The latter model requires an even number of subunits per ring. Although at this point we cannot distinguish between these models, experiments are in preparation to differentiate between them. The Rhodococcus proteasome may develop into an extremely useful research tool, should it prove to have a complexity intermediate between the archaebacterial and eukaryotic complexes.

Model (a) assumes two distinct proteasome populations; model (b) assumes one proteasome population formed by four distinct homo-oligomeric rings. The dotted line indicates our inability to determine rings with alternating whether the rings have six or seven members. Model (c) assumes one proteasome population formed by a and 13 subunits, and only appears likely in the case of six subunits per ring.

Conclusions
The ubiquitin pathway of protein degradation, in which the proteasome functions as the central protease, was originally believed to occur only in eukaryotes. More recently, proteasomes and ubiquitin were also found in the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum [13,28]. Following the identification of eubacterial sequences significantly related to proteasomes in GenBank [19], we have now isolated the first proteasome from a eubacterium. The data presented in this article show that the highmolecular weight protease which we identified in Rhodococcus sp. strain NI86/21 is a true 20S proteasome. The apparent molecular mass of the particle (690 kD) is comparable to that of the archaebacterial proteasome (700 kD), as are its insensitivity to 0.05 % SDS and its chymotryptic substrate specificity. In electron micrographs, the particle has the same dimensions and the same four-ringed, cylinder-shaped appearance as the archaebacterial and eukaryotic proteasomes. Finally, the sequences of its subunits are significantly related to those of ot-type and [3-type proteasome subunits. In conjunction with the recent description of ubiquitin in the eubacterium Anabaena variabilis [29], this discovery shows that the ubiquitin pathway is ancestral and common to all forms of life.

Purification of the Rhodococcus proteasome
All purification steps were performed at 4 C. Harvested cells (5-6 g per preparation) were washed twice with homogenate buffer (50 mM Hepes, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0), resuspended with 2 vol (mass/vol) of the same buffer and sonicated. The homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 61 700 xg. Proteolytic activity was tested using the synthetic peptide Suc-LeuLeu-Val-Tyr-AMC as a substrate. The 61 700 x g supernatant was loaded onto a Sepharose 6B column (3 x 90 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM Tris-HC1, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.0). Fractions of 5 ml were collected and assayed for proteolytic activity. The active, high-molecular mass fractions (500-700 kD) were pooled and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2 x 10 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted using a 0-400 mM NaC1 linear gradient in buffer A. Fractions of 3 ml were collected and assayed for proteolytic activity. The active fractions, obtained at approximately 250 mM NaC1, were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.0. The dialyzed sample was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (1.4 x 6 cm; Bio-Rad), equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer. Bound proteins were eluted using a 10-300 mM phosphate linear gradient. Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected and assayed for proteolytic activity. The active fractions, obtained at approximately 60 mM phosphate, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a Mono-Q column (5 mm x 5 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted using a 0-500 mM NaCl linear gradient in buffer A. Fractions of 0.6 ml were collected and assayed for proteolytic activity. The active fractions, obtained at approximately 350 mM NaCl, were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon-30 (Amicon). The concentrated sample was loaded onto a Superose 6 HR column (1 x 30 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCI, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed for peptidase activity. The protein content of the fractions was analyzed by 16.5 % Tricine-SDS-PAGE [32].

Materials and methods
Strains, media, and culture conditions
Rhodococcus sp. strain N86/21 was obtained from the National Collection of Agricultural and Industrial Microorganisms (NCAIM, Budapest, Hungary) and grown in Luria broth at 30 C.

Cloning and sequence analysis of proteasome structural genes
We have reported previously the cloning and partial sequence of a 14 kb Sad DNA fragment of Rhodococcus sp. strain NI86/21 in LambdaGEM-12 (FAJ2028) [20]. This fragment carries the thcRBCD gene cluster involved in herbicide degradation. In order to characterize the DNA region downstream of thcR, an overlapping 2.8 kb BamHI fragment was identified by Southern hybridization using the 306 bp PstI-Sad fragment of the XFAJ2028 insert as a probe. Subsequently, a pUC18 clone with this BamHI fragment (pFAJ2291) was isolated by colony hybridization from an enriched library containing BamHI fragments of the estimated size. The region further downstream was cloned into pUC18 as a 1.6 kb BgIII fragment overlapping with the aforementioned BamHI fragment. This clone (pFAJ2406) was identified using the 357 bp SmaI-BamHI fragment of the pFAJ2291 insert as a hybridization probe. Using the same probe, a second hybridizing band (BglII fragment of about 5.7 kb) was detected by Southern hybridization and cloned into pUC18 (pFAJ2450). The 595 bp SmaI-BglII fragment from pFAJ2450 was used as a probe in plaque hybridization to screen an EMBL3 library of Sau3A-digested genomic DNA. This allowed the identification of an EMBL3 clone (FAJ2029) with a DNA insert spanning the BglII fragment of pFAJ2450 and flanking DNA regions. DNA sequencing of both strands on overlapping fragments subcloned in pUC18 was carried out

Enzyme assays
Fluorigenic substrate peptides were obtained from Bachem. For peptidase assays, 10 nmoles of peptide (final concentration 100 p1M) were incubated with the enzyme sample for 15-60 min at 37 °C in 50 mM Tris-HCI buffer (pH 8.0) in the presence or absence of 0.05 % SDS, as described [33]. The final reaction volume was 100 p1l. The reaction was stopped by 1 adding 100 pI 10 % SDS, and the fluorescence of the reaction products was measured.

Amino-acid sequence analysis
Purified proteasomes were subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto a siliconized glass-fiber sheet (Glassybond, Biometra, G6ttingen, Germany), detected by Coomassie blue staining and either subjected directly to Edman degradation [34,35] or digested in situ using Lys-C prior to degradation in order to obtain internal sequences. A second set of internal sequences was obtained by subjecting purified proteasomes to Tricine-SDS-PAGE, staining, excising the bands, digesting in situ with Lys-C and separating the resulting peptides by HPLC prior to Edman degradation [36].

Current Biology 1995, Vol 5 No 7 Sequence alignment and phylogeny
Sequences were extracted from GenBank using ENTREZ (NCBI, Bethesda MD, USA) and aligned using PileUp (GCG Package, Genetics Computer Group, Madison WI, USA) and MACAW [37]. Final adjustments to the alignment were made manually in MALIGNED [38] using the known or predicted secondary structure of the subunits. Secondary structure predictions were obtained by submitting pre-aligned sequences to the PHD server (predictprotein@embl-heidelberg.de) [39]. Dendrograms were computed using the DARWIN server (cbrg@inf.ethz.ch) [40] and the FITCH module of PHYLIP 3.5p (distributed by the author, J. Felsenstein, joe@genetics. washington.edu).
