Abstract Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system we have identified a novel protein of the Ro-Ret family that was termed BSPRY. This protein is composed of a B-box, an K-helical coiled coil and a SPRY domain. BSPRY from human beings shares 80% sequence identity with the homologous protein from mice. The gene for BSPRY resides on human chromosome 9 and is specifically expressed in testis. It comprises six exons and five introns and possesses a GC rich promoter forming a typical CpG island. The function of BSPRY is not known, but several related proteins of the RBCC family have been implicated in cell transformation. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Zyxin is a LIM domain protein that contains an extended, proline-rich N-terminus [1^3]. It is expressed in ¢broblasts and other mesenchymal cells where it associates with focal adhesion sites and stress ¢bers. Zyxin appears to play an important role in the organization of micro¢laments. In accordance with this function it interacts with the focal adhesion proteins CRP and VASP as well as with the cytoskeletal protein K-actinin. Recently, we have mapped the zyxin/K-actinin interaction site to a motif of 22 amino acids present in the N-terminal domain of human zyxin [3]. Here we employed the yeast two-hybrid system to search for additional interaction partners. To this end the human zyxin cDNA was cloned into the bait vector pAS2 and used for screening of a placental cDNA library prepared in the prey vector pACT2 [4]. Several positive clones were obtained that encoded authentic K-actinin as well as two unrelated proteins. One of the novel clones (pBSPRY) that appears to interact fortuitously with zyxin will be described in this report. Clone pBSPRY contains an insert of 1524 bp that can be divided into a 5P UTR of 29 bp, an ORF of 1206 bp, a 3P UTR of 271 bp and a poly(A) tail of 18 nucleotides (accession number AJ276691). The ORF encodes a novel

protein of 402 amino acids (Mr 44.4 kDa) with an isoelectric point of 6.4 (Fig. 1). A search of the human EST databank identi¢ed 16 expressed sequence tags that overlap with the 3P end of our novel sequence. Most interestingly, all these 16 EST clones are derived from human tumors, including tumors of the breast, lung, kidney, colon, parathyroid and germ line. We also checked the mouse EST databank and identi¢ed more than 30 homologous mouse clones. Four of these EST clones were obtained from the German (p998H131081, p998H051913, p998P241232) and the British (ID455431) Resource Centers of the Human Genome Project and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. Together they span 1743 bp (accession number AJ276690) and encode the entire mouse homologue of the human BSPRY protein (Fig. 1). The murine protein is composed of 486 amino acids (Mr 54.2 kDa) with an isoelectric point of 6.2. The human and the murine sequences share 80% identity at the protein and 82% identity at the DNA level. Compared to the human protein, the murine protein contains an extension of 42 residues at the N-terminus and one of 36 residues at the C-terminus. Both extensions consist of repetitive sequences of low complexity. A detailed analysis of the two protein sequences with the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool SMART [5] reveals two conserved domains within the new protein. A SPRY domain of V120 residues is found at the Cterminus of the proteins (positions 284^396 in the human, 332^454 in the mouse protein). This domain was originally

identi¢ed in the splA kinase of Dictyostelium and the rabbit ryanodine receptor [6]. It may serve as a protein^protein interaction module [7], but an interaction with small RNA molecules has also been proposed [6]. Towards the N-terminus of the two proteins, there is a B-box motif of 42 residues (position 18^59 in the human, 66^107 in the mouse protein). B-box motifs form Zn-¢ngers in which cysteine and histidine residues serve as chelating ligands [8,9]. Compared to the consensus B-box motif C^X2 ^H^ X7 ^C^X7 ^C^X2 ^C^X5 ^H^X2 ^H, the novel protein exhibits a modi¢ed B-box of the form C^X2 ^H^X7 ^C^X7 ^C^ X2 ^C^X6 ^C^X2 ^H where the second histidine is replaced by cysteine. Starting within the B-box and extending to residue 82 in the human or 130 in the mouse protein, there is a stretch of V30 residues with a high probability of forming an amphipathic K-helix. Such K-helices are known to be required for the formation of a coiled coil as found in many extracellular matrix proteins, cytoskeletal proteins and transcription factors [10]. Since B-boxes seem to be followed always by a coiled coil domain, it has been suggested that the B-box may orient the coiled coil in a way to facilitate interaction through this domain [9]. At present SMART identi¢es 33 proteins that contain both a B-box and a SPRY domain (Fig. 2). In each case, the SPRY domain is located at the C-terminus of the corresponding protein and the spacing between the SPRY domain and the B-box is conserved. Two B-boxes are found in the estrogen responsive B-box protein EBBP [11], whereas a single one occurs in pyrin, the causative agent of familial Mediterranean fever [12]. All the other entries (n = 31) contain, in addition to the SPRY domain and the B-box, another Zn ¢nger motif called the RING ¢nger (Fig. 2). This domain is reminiscent of the B-box and can be de¢ned as C^X2 ^C^X9À39 ^C^X1À3 ^H^X2À3 ^C/ H^X2 ^C^X4À48 ^C^X2 ^C [13,14]. The prototype of the proteins with RING ¢nger, B-box and coiled coil domain (RBCC proteins) is RO52, the autoantigen in primary Sjogren's syndrome [15]. Some RBCC proteins such as the transcription factor Midline [16] possess a second Bbox motif as well as an FN3 domain related to ¢bronectin. Particular interest has focused on RBCC proteins because

they seem to be involved in cell transformation [8]. RET for example possesses transforming potential when recombined with a tyrosine kinase domain. In the case of PML, recombination with the retinoic acid receptor is associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Recent ¢ndings implicate the RING ¢nger in speci¢c ubiquitination events [17]. Whether our BSPRY protein that is lacking the RING ¢nger motif at its N-terminus might also play a role in

targeting proteins for destruction remains to be determined. In an e¡ort to de¢ne the human chromosome harboring the BSPRY gene, we searched the databank of un¢nished high throughput genomic sequences HTGS. We were able to identify a genomic clone of 200 kb (accession number AL137066) that is derived from human chromosome 9. Although sequencing of this clone has not yet been completed, we were able to locate all the exon^intron boundaries of the corresponding gene (Table 1). Based on this working draft, the gene for BSPRY encompasses six exons and ¢ve introns. The size of the introns cannot be predicted because the sequence of the genomic clone still consists of 23 unordered pieces. The size of the exons varies from 26 to more than 800 bp. All the splice boundaries conform to the consensus sequence yyyyyncagG(exon)AGgtragt [18]. The ¢rst exon encompasses the 5PUTR and the region encoding the entire B-box. The second exon encodes the K-helical region that is likely to form a coiled coil. The following three exons encode the central domain(s) of the novel protein, while the sixth exon comprises the region for the SPRY domain and the 3PUTR. Thus, each protein domain seems to be encoded by a separate exon in accordance with the theory of exon shuf£ing [19]. The 5P end of the gene is particularly GC rich and forms a typical CpG island [20]. CpG islands were originally found associated with the 5P end of housekeeping genes and some oncogenes [21]. However, recent evidence suggests that CpG islands constitute the promoters of about 50% of all mammalian genes [22]. The presence of the CpG island at the 5P end of our gene further con¢rms that we have cloned the complete BSPRY mRNA and that the novel protein does not possess a RING ¢nger at its N-terminus in contrast to all RBCC proteins (Fig. 2). The expression of the BSPRY gene was studied on a Northern blot containing RNA from eight di¡erent mouse tissues. A radiolabeled probe speci¢c for the novel mRNA

hybridized exclusively to RNA from testis (Fig. 3). With RNA from this tissue, our probe detected two bands of 2.1 and 2.5 kb. The size of the lower band is consistent with the size of the total mouse cDNA sequence assuming a poly(A) tail of 300 nucleotides. The upper band might be generated by usage of an alternative, downstream poly(A) site. Expression of BSPRY in a single tissue is unexpected in view of the fact that zyxin which has been used as a bait in the two-hybrid screen is broadly expressed in ¢broblastic cells of the lose connective tissue. It is therefore unlikely that BSPRY will bind to zyxin in real life despite its reproducible two-hybrid signal. Whether an interaction occurs in testis and whether this potential interaction has any physiological relevance remains to be determined. References
