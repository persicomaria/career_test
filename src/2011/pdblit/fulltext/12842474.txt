To maximize the expression of the cephalosporin-C deacetylase (CAH) gene isolated from Bacillus subtilis SHS 0133 in Escherichia coli, a seriesof expression plasmids was constructed with various spacings between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the ATG initiation codon. As the most efficient expression plasmid, we selected pCAH431, which has the trp promoter, a replication origin derived from pAT153, and a spacing of 13 nucleotides. E. coli JM103 with pCAH431 produced 4.9 g of CAH per liter on cultivation at 37'C for 20 h in a 30-Zjar fermentor. Since the amount of CAH reached about 70% of the total protein in the soluble fraction of the cells, and CAH was recovered from the cell extracts in an active form, the CAH was pm-Bed easily to homogeneity by only one column chromatography step. Twenty grams of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid was completely converted to deacetyl-7-aminocephalosporanic acid, a starting material for cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride, by 12 mg of the purified enzyme without significant appearance of by-products. Thus, our expression and purification system has made the industrial production of CAH possible. [Key words: cephalosporin-C

Cephalosporin-C deacetylase (designated CAH) [EC 3.1.1.411 is an esterase that catalyzes deacetylation at the 3' position of cephalosporins. Deacetyl cephalosporins are used as starting materials for various semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotics such as cefuroxime (1) and cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride (Flomox) (2). We have already reported the purification and characterization of CAH from Bacillus subtilis SHS 0133 (3). CAH, composed of eight identical subunits, with a molecular mass of 35,571 daltons, was expected to be useful for the production of deacetyl cephalosporins because of its high k,,, values for various cephalosporins and negligible product inhibition. In a previous work (4), we succeeded in molecular cloning and expression of the CAH gene and showed that the Escherichia coli host-vector system led to enzymatically active production of CAH in the cells. In regard to construction of the expression plasmid, we have studied the influences of plasmid copy number (gene dosage effect) and promoters used in the expression plasmids (transcriptional efficiency). The results showed that strong expression of CAH was induced in the plasmid pCAH400 having its replication origin from pAT153 (5) and a trp promoter. To produce large quantities of CAH in a cost-effective manner, we further investigated the high-level expression, paying special attention to the translational efficiency. Gold (6) reported that the spacing between the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) (7) sequence and the ATG initiation codon strongly affects the expression efficiency at the translational level. In this paper, we examine highlevel expression of the CAH gene in E. coli by optimizing the spacing and some properties of the recombinant CAH purified from recombinant cells.

Materials Restriction endonucleases and other DNAmodifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd. (Kyoto) and used under the conditions specified by the supplier. The molecular weight standard for protein was purchased from Bio Rad Laboratories (CA, USA). 7Aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) was obtained from Asahi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. (Nobeoka, Miyazaki). Lysyl-endopeptidase was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Co. Ltd. (Osaka), and Cosmosil 5Cls column was purchased from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto). Recombinant DNA techniques Preparation of plasmid DNA and analysis of DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis were carried out in accordance with the method of Sambrook et al. (8). Transformation was carried out as described by Hanahan (9). Construction of ATG vectors Four ATG vectors, pTrp.pBR.Sn.ATG (n=l, 2 or 3) and pTrp.pAT.Sst. ATG, kindly supplied by Dr. H. Teraoka (Shionogi Research Laboratories), were used for the construction of the expression plasmids of CAH in E. coli. Vectors pTrp . pBR. Sn. ATG (n= 1, 2 or 3) were constructed by ligation of three DNA fragments: (i) a ClaI-EcoRI fragment, Sl, S2 or S3 adapter, each having different spacing between the SD sequence and ATG initiation codon (as shown in Table 1); (ii) a PstI-ClaI fragment, which contains the trp promoter, from pCAH400 (4); (iii) an EcoRI-PstI fragment, which has a tetracycline-resistant (TcT) marker and a replication origin from pBR322. Another ATG vector, pTrp .pAT. Sst .ATG, was constructed by ligation of two fragments: (i) a ClaI-ClaI fragment (S4 adapter) with a different spacing between the SD sequence and ATG initiation codon (as shown in Table 1); (ii) a ClaI-ClaI fragment, which has a trp promoter, Tc' marker, and a replication origin of pAT153, from pCAH400 (4).

four ATG vectors have a unique synthetic EcoRI or MI site between the SD sequence and the ATG codon. Digestion with EcoRI or S&I followed by blunt-ending with mung-bean nuclease or Klenow fragment exposes the initiation codon. The CAH structural gene fragment which starts at CAA, coding the second amino acid (Gln), and extends to the 3' noncoding region was obtained as described previously (4). The strategy for constructing the expression plasmids is shown in Fig. 1. The CAH structural gene fragment with a MI site in the 3' noncoding region was inserted between EcoRI/mung-bean nuclease and SoYI sites of pTrp .pBR-Sn.ATG (n= 1, 2 or 3) for construction of the expression plasmids

pCAH41, 42, and 43. In the same manner, the expression plasmid pCAH440 was constructed by ligating the CAH structural gene fragment digested with XbaI in the 3' noncoding region with the pTrp.pAT.Sst SATG vector being cleaved with the SstI/Klenow fragment and XbaI. Plasmids pCAH41, 42, and 43 have a replication origin from pBR322 and an ampicillin-resistant marker (API). Hence, these plasmids were improved upon to change the replication origin and the resistant marker, and to introduce the terminator region. The PvuII-XbaI fragment harboring the trp promoter and CAH structural gene from pCAH41, 42, or 43 was ligated to the pCAH211 (4) cleaved with the EcoRI/Klenow fragment and XbaI,

which contained a replication origin from pAT153, the Tc' marker, and the 5s rrnBTITz terminator, and new expression plasmids pCAH411, 421, and 431 were constructed. To introduce the terminator region to pCAH440, the XbaI-BumHI region was changed to the XbaI-BarnHI fragment of pCAH211, and a new expression plasmid pCAH441 was constructed. The resultant plasmids were introduced into E. coli strain JM103, and tetracycline-resistant transformants were isolated. The nucleotide sequence in the spacing region in the plasmids extracted from the transformants was confirmed by the chain termination method of Sanger et al. (10). Expression of CAH in E. coli E. coli strain JM103 (11) was used as the host cell for the production of CAH. E. coli strains were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar (8) supplemented with 20 pg/ml tetracycline. The production of CAH in a 30-l jar fermentor was carried out as described previously (4). In this study, the glycerol concentration in the medium was increased to 8%. The pH of the broth was maintained at 7.0 with 28% NH40H or 85% H3P04. Air was sparged at a rate of 0.75 vvm at a slightly positive pressure with agitation at 500rpm. Growth was assessed by measuring the optical density (OD) at 650 nm. Assay for recombinant CAH activity The expression levels of recombinant CAH by E. coli transformants harboring various plasmids were compared by measuring the activities of the expressed enzymes with a crude extract. Preparation of the crude extract and the enzyme assay were performed as described previously (4). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount producing 1 !lrnol of p-nitrophenol from pnitrophenyl acetate in one min at 30°C (3). The K,,, values for 7-ACA, cephapirin, cephalothin, cephaloglytin, and cephalosporin-C were determined as described previously (3). Data fitting was carried out with the KaleidaGraph software (Abelbeck Software, USA). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis Cells in 0.5 ml of culture broth were collected, lysed in 0.5 ml of sample buffer [O.l M Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% 2mercaptoethanol] and 2.5 ~1 of the cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (12). After the electrophoresis was complete, the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Purification of the recombinant CAH The cells were harvested by centrifugation of 1 f of the culture broth of the E. coli JM103 harboring pCAH431. After resuspending the cells in 0.5 I of sodium phosphate buffer (50mM, pH 7.0), they were disrupted by three passages of the suspension through a Manton-Gaulin homogenizer (model 15M-8TA, APV Gaulin GmbH, Lubeck, Germany) at 8OOOpsi. For the purification, 50ml of the disrupted cell suspension was used. To remove cell debris, the suspension was incubated with 1.5 g of Filter-aid (Micro-Cel T-38; Manville Co. Ltd., CO, USA), at 30°C for 1 h, and the cell lysate was clarified by filtration. Subsequently, the cell lysate was concentrated to 10 ml by ultrafiltration through a UK-50 ultramembrane (Advantech Co. Ltd., Tokyo). One-third of the concentrated cell extract was subjected to HPLC on DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M (Tosoh Co. Ltd., Tokyo). This step was repeated three times. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated. The homogeneity of the enzyme was examined by SDS-PAGE.

Preparation of anti-CAH antiserum A polyclonal rabbit anti-CAH preparation was obtained by immunization of rabbits with CAH purified from B. subtilis SHS 0133. Rabbits were immunized three times during one month. Serum was obtained one month after the third immunization, and titers of the antibodies were measured. The anti-CAH antiserum preparation was used for Western blot detection. Western blot analysis The SDS-PAGE pattern was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio Rad laboratories) using a semi-dry blotter (Millipore Corp., MA, USA). The blots were treated with rabbit anti-CAH antibody and subsequently with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP). HRP was detected with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence System (Amersham International plc., Buckinghamshire, UK). Determination of molar extinction coefficient Absorption at 280nm was measured on a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. The protein contents were determined with an amino acid analyzer (model 835, Hitachi, Tokyo) after hydrolysis by 4 M methanesulphonic acid containing 0.2% 3-(2-aminoethyl)indole for 24 h at 110°C (13). Conversion of 7-ACA to deacetyl-7-ACA After 20 g of 7-ACA was dissolved in 200ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 2.5 kU of recombinant CAH (about 12mg) was added and the mixture was kept at 20°C for 110 min with mild agitation, pH was continually adjusted to 8.0 with 4N NaOH. 7-ACA and deacetyl 7-ACA were measured by reverse-phase HPLC on a Cosmosil 5Cls column. Reverse-phase HPLC was performed with 20 mM sodium dihydrogenphosphate containing 5 mM tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide and 7.5% methanol at flow rate of 1 ml/min. RESULTS Construction of expression plasmids Our previous plasmid pCAH400 (4) had the nucleotide sequence, GTATCGATTCC, between the SD sequence and ATG codon. Herman et al. (14) reported that the SD region being followed by the AT-rich regions led to high levels of translation of human leukocyte interferon A. Therefore, we prepared four expression plasmids having different spacings of distances ranging from 10 to 13 nucleotides (nt), with AT-rich sequences immediately before the ATG codon, as described in Materials and Methods. The nucleotide sequences at the spacings in the obtained plasmids, pCAH411, pCAH421, pCAH43 1, and pCAH441, were confirmed (Table 1).

jar fermentor. Table 1 shows the relationship between the SD-ATG sequences and the CAH activities expressed by the various E. coli transformants. E. coli JM103 harboring pCAH431 (with a spacing of 13 nt) produced the highest level of CAH (1.04 kU/ml of culture). The CAH expression level with pCAH421 (spacing of 11 nt) was slightly lower. However, pCAH411 (spacing of 10 nt) and pCAH441 (spacing of 11 nt) were associated with much lower expression levels of the CAH gene. Figure 2a shows the typical pattern of CAH production by E. coli JM103(pCAH431) in a 30-I jar fermentor. The activity of the expressed CAH increased with cell growth and reached 1.04 kU/ml of culture, after 20 h of incubation. This value corresponded to 4.9g of CAH protein per 1 I of culture broth since the specific activity of purified CAH was 210 U/mg. CAH was estimat1200 (a) 1000

ed to constitute about 70% of the total protein in the soluble fraction of cell lysates considering that the specific activity of the CAH in the fraction was about 150U/mg. The production of CAH protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE of the soluble fraction (Fig. 2b). In agreement with the increase in CAH activity, the intensity of the protein band corresponding to the CAH subunit (35-kDa) increased with time and showed the main band at the end of cultivation. The procePurification of the recombinant CAH dure for purification of the recombinant CAH was outlined in Materials and Methods. Table 2 summarizes the result of a typical purification process. The enzyme was easily purified to homogeneity on SDS-PAGE with a yield of 63% and a specific activity of 210U/mg (Fig. 3). The enzyme could be stored at 4°C for one year without significant loss of activity. Western blot analysis, as shown in Fig. 3, revealed that the 35-kDa protein reacted strongly with an antibody specific to the CAH protein. This demonstrated that the recombinant CAH was identical to natural CAH.

acid composition of the recombinant CAH were in good agreement with those determined from the DNA sequence (4). The properties of the recombinant CAH are summarized in Table 3. The K,,, values of the recombinant CAH for 7-ACA, cephapirin, cephalothin, cephaloglycin, and cephalosporin-C were 7.4, 16.7, 11.7, 9.2, and 34.5 mM, respectively. There were no differences in enzymatic activities between natural and recombinant CAH. These findings indicate that the recombinant CAH had the same protein-chemical and enzymatic properties as natural CAH. The absorption coefficient, E lcm, 1%~ and the extinction coefficient in the 280 nm region of the enzyme (as an octamer), &280,were determined to be 14.5 and 406,000 M-lcm-l, respectively. Application to deacetyl-7-ACA production We attempted to convert 7-ACA to deacetyl-7-ACA using the purified enzyme, however, the reaction at optimal temperature was not suitable for application to industrial use because the product was unstable above room temperature. When the reaction was performed at 37°C deacetyl-7-ACA spontaneously changed to 3-hydroxymethyl7-amino cephalosporanic lactone (deacetyl-7-ACA-LT). Therefore, the practical reaction conditions were optimized. Table 4 shows the K,,, and V,, values of the recombinant CAH for 7-ACA at various temperatures. We determined to use recombinant CAH at 20°C since the enzyme has sufficient activity for the conversion of 7-

ACA at 20°C. Figure 4a shows that 20g of 7-ACA were converted to deacetyl-7-ACA in 99% yield at 20°C within 100 min by 2.5 kU (corresponding to approximately 12mg) of recombinant CAH. After the reaction was complete, there was only a negligible amount of deacetyl-7-ACA-LT (not more than 0.2%), and impurities, such as 7-aminodeacetoxy cephalosporanic acid (7ADCA) (about O.l%), and N-acetyl-derivatives (about 0.02X), as shown in Fig. 4b. DISCUSSION We previously reported the expression of CAH from B. subtilis in E. coli. In this paper, we examined higher level expression of CAH by increasing the translational efficiency. The binding of the ribosome to the ribosomalbinding site (RBS) on the mRNA, the first step of translation, is known to be influenced by the length as well as the base composition of the spacing between the SD sequence and the initiation codon (15). Several groups have tried to improve the spacing for strong expression of a desired gene. Marquis et al. (16) reported that the optimal distance between the SD sequence and the initiation codon is dependent upon the promoter used. Sato et al. (17) reported an optimal spacing of 13 nt for the expression of tuna growth hormone cDNA. In view of these observations, we constructed expression plasmids with various lengths of SD-ATG sequences containing an AT-rich region just before the initiation codon. Of these plasmids, pCAH431 (a spacing of 13 nt) showed the highest CAH activity (Table 1). The results

stituted 70% of total soluble protein, which is probably the maximal expression level. The enzyme was easily recovered in an active form and purified to homogeneity by only one column chromatography step, since the purity of the cell lysate obtained by Micro-Cel T-38 treatment was more than 90% (Table 2). The purified enzyme was characterized for use in the production of deacetyl cephalosporins. Under optimal reaction conditions, the CAH catalyzed complete conversion of 7-ACA to deacetyl 7-ACA without significant appearance of byproducts, indicating that the enzyme is practically useful. In our company, the enzyme is used in the industrial production of deacetyl-7-ACA, the starting material for Flomox synthesis.

suggest that the length of the spacing influenced gene expression as described by Sato et al. (17). However, the base composition of the spacing is probably another important factor because expression levels of pCAH421 and pCAH441 differed despite the same distance between the SD sequence and the ATG initiation codon (11 nt). So, we predicted the local secondary structure of mRNAs, including the SD-ATG sequences, by computer analysis using the method of Zuker and Stiegler (18). Figure 5 shows the structure of mRNA from each of the expression plasmids used. For all plasmids, a stem and loop structure was predicted between the SD sequence and the CAH coding region. In the plasmids with higher levels of expression (pCAH421, pCAH431), the AUG initiation codon was found in the loop, suggesting that the RBS and ribosome were easily accessible to each other. On the other hand, in plasmids with lower levels of expression (pCAH411, pCAH441), the AUG codon was anchored in the stem structure. Such occlusion of the AUG codon by the stem-loop structure may cause lower translational efficiency. By alteration of the spacing, we succeeded in overexpression of the CAH gene in E. coli under the control of the trp promoter. In batch cultures of the recombinant E. coli, CAH concentration of 4.9g per 1 was obtained in a 20 h culture. This productivity of CAH is among the highest for recombinant proteins in an E. coli hostvector system. Human growth hormone (19) and human (Y consensus interferon (20) were reported to be produced at 1.75 g and 5.6 g per I, respectively, in fed batch cultures in which a high cell density is achieved. In the present case, sufficient quantities of recombinant CAH were obtained in a cost-effective manner in a simple batch culture system. CAH in these E. coli cells con-
