Abstract--D -Alanine≠D -alanine ligase (DDl) is an essential enzyme in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis and an important target for developing new antibiotics. Here, we describe a new approach to identify new inhibitor scaffolds for DDl based on similarity in the ATP binding region of different kinases and DDl. After an initial screening of several protein kinase inhibitors, we found that the Brutons's tyrosine kinase inhibitor LFM-A13, an analog of the Leflunomide metabolite A771726, inhibits DDl with a Ki of 185 lM. A series of malononitrilamide and salicylamide derivatives of LFM-A13 has been synthesized to confirm the validity of this scaffold as an inhibitor of DDl. ” 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Bacteria resist hypotonic shock and cell lysis through the biosynthesis of a peptidoglycan-containing cell wall which gives the cell shape and structural strength and insulates the organism from external osmotic pressure. Most antibiotics exploit the vulnerability of the assembly of this extra cellular polymer. For example, the cross-linking transpeptidation is a major target for blactam antibiotics (penicillines, cephalosporines). Glycopeptides such as vancomycin and teicoplanin target the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria by selectively binding to the D -alanyl≠D -alanine termini of peptidoglycan precursors and preventing their cross linking to adjacent strands.1,2 However, bacteria are continually mutating and resistance has evolved to every antibiotic ever placed into clinical practice, irrespective of their chemical class or the molecular target of the drug. More strikingly, first signs of alarm appear with increasing resistance to vancomycin which had been reserved as a drug of `last resort', used only after treatment with other antibiotics had failed. Bacteria with reduced vancomycin susceptibility such as vancoKeywords: D -Ala≠D -ala ligase; Kinase inhibitor; Antibiotics. Corresponding author.

mycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) need higher levels of vancomycin to be killed and are thought to be an intermediate stage to the development of bacteria that are fully resistant.3 There consequently remains a strong need for novel antibiotics, particularly directed against multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria. 1.1. DDl as potential target for new antibiotics
D -Alanine≠D -alanine ligase (DDl) (E.C. 6.3.2.4) catalyzes the ATP-dependent assembly of the dipeptide D alanyl≠D -alanine (D -ala≠D -Ala) which is an essential building block for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.4 DDl consists of four domains, whose interfaces create binding sites for D -Ala and ATP, respectively. The formation of D -Ala≠D -Ala proceeds via a two-step mechanism. First, a D -Ala unit is phosphorylated by ATP to produce an intermediate which subsequently will react with the second D -Ala moiety to form the dipeptide. For Escherichia coli two isoforms of DDl, DDlA, and DDlB, have been described and share a sequence homology of 35%.5 D -Ala≠D -Ala is common to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms and highly conserved among prokaryotes and has no eukaryotic counterparts. Therefore, DDl has emerged as an attractive target to develop novel antibiotics.5

a structural analog of D -Ala, is the only small molecule known to inhibit DDl activity and to result in an antibiotic effect (Scheme 1). D -Cycloserine inhibits enzyme activity as a D -Ala competitive inhibitor with a reported Ki of 27 lM and is proposed to bind to the first D -Ala binding site.5≠7 However, its poor selectivity and toxicity limits its use.6,8 Other inhibitors of DDl such as phosphonate and phosphinate dipeptides have been described as transition-state analogs that bind to the enzymes active site and inhibit enzyme function with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. However, these molecules failed to show significant antibacterial activity.9≠11 Using a de novo structure-based molecular design software SPROUT, a new inhibitor for DDlB was recently designed.12 In another approach, 3-chloro-2,2-dimethyl-N-4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl-propan-amide was found as an inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus DDl in a high≠throughput screen. This molecule does not interfere with direct binding of ATP or D -Ala but binds to a hydrophobic pocket near the first D -Ala binding site.13 Finally, a small family of diazenedicarboxamides were developed as inhibitors of DDlB with activities in the micromolar range.14 1.2. A link between protein and lipid kinases and DDl In order to find new inhibitor scaffolds for DDl, we drew from earlier investigations15≠17 and based our search on the similarity that exists between the ATP binding domains of various kinases and the glutathione synthase fold (ATP-grasp) to which DDl belongs. Preliminary studies reported similarities between DDl and protein kinases, such as casein kinase (CK1), AMPc, cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), the Src family tyrosine kinase Hck, the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRK), phosphorylase kinase (PhK), the extra cellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK2), and lipid kinases such as PI3K.18≠20 Structural alignments of the ATP binding sites of DDl and different classes of kinases highlight a conserved topology of the co-factor binding site as well as the same relative orientation of the adenine part of ATP (Fig. 1). These common features served as starting points toward our investigations of novel DDl inhibitors.

2. Results and discussion 2.1. Kinase inhibitors as starting points for new inhibitors of DDl Over the last decades, kinases have evolved as a major class of target proteins in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. In order to shut down unwanted kinase activities, a plethora of small organic molecules has since been developed to inhibit kinase function by targeting the ATP binding pocket of the kinase domain.21≠25 Typically, such inhibitors bind to the ATP binding site of the kinase through the formation of 2≠ 3 hydrogen bonds and through hydrophobic interactions in and around the region occupied by the adenine ring of ATP.  Although some selective ATP competitive kinase inhibitors have been developed, the highly conserved nature of the ATP binding region often results in inhibitor scaffolds with poor kinase selectivity. This conserved nature of ATP binding sites among other protein classes and the wealth of ATP competitive kinase inhibitors could serve as a starting point for the development of inhibitors that target proteins other than kinases. 2.2. Biochemical screening Based on the described similarities between the ATP binding sites of DDl and protein and lipid kinases we developed a new approach to find new inhibitor scaffolds binding to the ATP binding site of DDl. A collection of 27 different ATP competitive kinase inhibitors was selected and screened at mM concentrations against DDl measuring residual activity. ATP competitive kinase inhibitors identified as DDl inhibitors are given in Table 1 (complete list of compounds tested is provided as supporting information). Under the conditions tested, DDl was better inhibited by the EGFR kinase inhibitors Tyrphostin-47 (T-47), Tyrphostin-51 (T-51) and by the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor LFM-A13. Slight inhibition could be detected for the AMPc inhibitor HA-1004, the CDK2 inhibitor Olomoucine, and the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor Piceatannol. Interestingly, the known PI3K inhibitors Wortmannin, and LY294002 were also found to inhibit DDl. Detailed inhibition studies were then performed for the most potent DDl inhibitors identified in the initial screen. DDl enzyme inhibition was measured at different inhibitor and ATP concentrations in order to determine Ki values and the type of inhibition. For Ki determinations, parallel series of experiments were made under the same conditions in the presence of various inhibitor concentrations and data were analyzed by using Lineweaver≠Burk plots (Table 1). Tyrphostin T-47, Olomoucine, LY29004, and LFM-A13 were found to be ATP competitive inhibitors of DDl. However, the Tyrphostin

T-51, although a structural homolog of T-47, showed the profile of a mixed inhibitor for DDl. Interestingly, mixed inhibition has also been reported for T-51 when screened against kinase activity.30≠32 The Tyrphostins were originally designed on the basis of the polyphenol erbstatin,33 a mixed ATP and substrate competitive kinase inhibitor. T-51 and T-47 are reported as potent inhibitors of EGFR and PDGFR with IC50 values in the low micromolar range.30≠32 The malononitrilamide LFM-A13 belongs to a series of compounds that were synthesized based on the active Leflunomide metabolite A77172634 (Scheme 2). Leflunomide is an antirheumatic drug (Arava“) known to inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. However, its metabolite A771726 (11) has been hypothesized to exert immunosuppressive activity by the inhibition of several protein kinases such as PDGFR,35 EGFR36,37, and to prevent phosphorylation of Jak1, and Jak3 that are necessary for Interleukin-2 receptor signaling.38 Several analogs of A771726 such as LFM-A12 and LFM-A13 were also reported to inhibit EGFR,35 Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK),34 Jak2,39 Tec40, and Polo-like kinases (Plk).41 2.3. Synthesis Based on the findings that the binding of ATP to DDl can be inhibited by ATP competitive kinase inhibitors of the malononitrilamide class in the micromolar range, we developed a focused library based on LFM-A13 to establish further structure≠activity relationships. To explore substitution patterns at the aniline moiety, compounds 11 and 15≠18 were synthesized according to published procedures.34 Briefly, different substituted anilines were coupled to cyanoacetic acid in the presence of diisopropylcarbodiimide followed by treatment with NaH and acylation with acetylchloride (Scheme 3). Simplified salicylic acid derivatives such as 12≠14 were synthesized by coupling of anilines to acetylsalicylic acid and further deprotected to investigate whether the bketo nitrile group is needed for DDl inhibitory activity. Such analogs are thought to mimic a planar conformation that is considered the active conformation of

A77172642,43 and stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Finally, the extended analog of LFM-A13 19, which is further functionalized with a carboxylate and the simplified analog 20, that retains the aryl substitution, however, lacks the nitrile group and the enol and thus is not able to form the discussed intramolecular hydrogen bond were synthesized to study the structural features required for inhibition. The prepared derivatives were evaluated for their ability to inhibit recombinant DDl. Compounds were screened in a DDl assay that was carried out in the presence of 250 lM ATP and 500 lM D -Ala. Orthophosphate was detected with malachite green. Structure≠activities are provided in Table 2. The inhibitory activity of LFMA13 could be retained by the salicylic derivative 12 and slightly increased by 15, 18. Compound 18 with CF3-substituents in the 2and 5-position showed higher activity compared to LFM-A13 (bromo-substitution in 2,5-position). Similar results were obtained for the 2-chloro-6-methyl derivative 15. However, neither A771726 (CF3 in the 4-position) nor the dimethyl- (16) or trimethyl-analog 17 showed any DDl inhibiting activity. Changes in the aliphatic region of the molecules were not tolerated and the extended analogs 19 and the carbamate 20 were not active. 3. Conclusions Using structural alignments of the ATP binding sites of the bacterial ligase DDl and protein and lipid kinases in complex with ATP analogs, we rationalized that inhibition of DDl activity may be achieved by ATP competitive kinase inhibitors. We tested a series of commercially available kinase inhibitors and found LFM-A13 and Tyrphostine derivatives to inhibit DDl enzyme activity. Based on the initial screening results we synthesized a series of malononitrilamide and salicylamide derivatives

and were able to confirm the validity of these scaffolds as inhibitors of DDl. From this investigation we gained a better understanding of the structural requirements and limitations necessary for the preparation of ATP competitive DDl inhibitors. The compounds in this study may serve as starting points for the development of bi-substrate inhibitors that incorporate both an ATP competitive and a substrate competitive moiety. Bisubstrate inhibitors that block the ATP and D -Ala binding sites should exhibit enhanced selectivity and potency profiles by preferentially inhibiting DDl over kinases. 4. Experimental 4.1. General Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were obtained from Aldrich, Acros, and Fluka and were used without further purification. The following materials were obtained from Gerbu Biochemicals: EDTA, IPTG, and ampicillin. The following materials were obtained from Serva: HEPES, PMSF, and DTT. MgCl2 and KCl were obtained from J.T. Baker and (NH4)2SO4 from Riedel de Haen. Kinase inhibitors were obtained from Sigma, To® cris or Biomol. All solvents were distilled by standard procedures. All reactions were performed under argon with freshly distilled and dried solvents. Analytical chromatography was performed by using Merck silica gel 60 F254 aluminum plates. Flash chromatography was performed by using Acros silica gel (0.035≠0.07 mm). 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data were recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 or Varian Mercury VX 400 spectrometer at RT. NMR spectra were calibrated to the solvent signals

IR spectra were measured on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer with an A527 diffuse reflectance head from Spectra Tech. 4.2. Expression and purification The plasmid W3110/pTB2 containing the E. coli DDlB gene was a gift of C.T. Walsh (Havard Medical School, Boston). Expression and purification of E. coli DDlB was performed according to the modified protocol of Zawadzke et al.5 All steps were performed at 4 ∞C unless otherwise specified.

of 1 mM for induction. Cells were then grown for 4 h at 25 ∞C and harvested by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet (ca. 8 g) was resuspended in 20 mL of lysis buffer (100 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.2) and was passed through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corporation, Newton, MA). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. Powdered ammonium sulfate was gradually added to the supernatant to a concentration of 50% saturation, and the solution was stirred for 45 min. The solution was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, and ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 50% saturation. After being stirred for additional 45 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The precipitate was resuspended in column buffer and the resuspended pellet dialysed (Spectrum regenerated Cellulose MWCO 5000 kDa) over night against column buffer. After centrifugation (15 min, 10,000 rpm) the supernatant was applied to a Source Q30 (XK6/20, GE Healthcare) with 2 mL/min and washed with column buffer (5 mL/min). Protein was eluted at 4.0 mL/min with a gradient up to 300 mM KCl in column buffer. The activity eluted at $150 mM KCl. The purified protein appeared as a 32-kDa band on SDS≠polyacrylamide gel (15 %). 4.3. D -Alanine≠D -alanine ligase activity The assay was carried out in a 96-well format at a total reaction volume of 50 lL at 37 ∞C. The reaction mixture contained the following components (final concentration): 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 250 lM ATP, 500 lM D -Ala, (2 mM) DDlB (0.13 lg), and compound (2 mM). The antibiotic D cycloserine, a known substrate competitive inhibitor of DDl was used as positive control (Ki for DDlB 27 lM). Compounds were pre-incubated with all assay components except the substrates for 30 min. D -Ala and ATP were added to start the reaction. After 15 min, DDlB activity was monitored by detection of orthophosphate using malachite green45 (80 lL of malachite green-molybdate solution were added (2.45 mM malachite oxalate salt, 16 mM of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in 4 N HCl), followed by 10 lL of 34% sodic citrate solution). The plates were read at 620 nm after additional 20 min. Ki determinations were performed under similar conditions using D -Ala (32 mM), ATP (600 lM, 300 lM, 200, lM, 100 lM) and inhibitor (1 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, 4 mM) with 15 min incubation at 25 ∞C. 4.4. Chemistry All syntheses were performed by following literature procedures.34,43 4.4.1. General procedure A. Step (i): Acetylsalicylic acid (1.6 equiv) was added to thionyl chloride (3.2 equiv), and the suspension was refluxed until complete dissolution of the acid (1 h). The resulting yellow solution was then cooled to room temperature, and remaining thionyl chloride was evaporated under reduced pressure.

Crude acyl chloride was dissolved in chloroform, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure (3 times). The oily residue was redissolved in dichloromethane and the resulting solution slowly added at 0 ∞C to a mixture of substituted anilines (1 equiv) and triethylamine (3.3 equiv) in dichloromethane. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, followed by successive washing of the organic phase with 1 N HCl, 1 N NaOH, and water, drying with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporation under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (eluent, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate, 9:1) to afford compounds 12a≠14a. Step (ii): Imidazole (4 equiv) was added to a 0.03 M solution of 12a≠14a (1 equiv) in methanol and was stirred at room temperature overnight. The resulting white precipitate was filtered off and dried under vacuum. 4.4.2. General procedure B. Steps (iii) and (iv): Cyanoacetic acid (1.6 equiv) and substituted aniline (1 equiv) were dissolved in THF (25 mL) and stirred at 0 ∞C. Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) was added over 5 min. The reaction was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. AcOEt was added and the organic phase was sequentially washed with a 1 N HCl solution, with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Finally, the crude solid product was recrystallized from ethyl alcohol or used without further purification. Sodium hydride (2 equiv) was added slowly to a solution of amide in tetrahydrofuran (1 equiv; 0.3 M) at 0 ∞C. After stirring for 30 min at 0 ∞C, acetyl chloride (1.1 equiv) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was continued overnight and then quenched by the addition of acetic acid. The mixture was poured into water containing hydrochloric acid to precipitate the crude product, which was collected by filtration and washed with water. The final pure product was obtained in some cases by recrystallization. 4.5.
