Replacement Surgery with Unnatural Amino Acids in the Lock-and-Key Joint of Glutathione Transferase Subunits
Usama M. Hegazy,1 Ulf Hellman,2 and Bengt Mannervik1,* 1 Department of Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry Biomedical Center Uppsala University Box 576 SE-751 23 Uppsala Sweden 2 Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Biomedical Center Uppsala University Box 595 SE-751 24 Uppsala Sweden bonds to GSH from several amino acid residues (the side chains of Trp39, Lys45, and Gln52) [8, 9]. Structural transitions of this mobile region modulate GSH affinity and control the rate of catalysis by shifting the bound GSH from a precatalysis position to the position forming the transition state. Insertion of the key residue of one subunit into the lock structure of the other subunit stabilizes the loop following the a2 helix, thereby enhancing the affinity for GSH and the rate of catalysis [10]. Truncation of the side chain of residue 50 into Ala and mutation into other amino acid residues causes a dramatic loss of catalytic activity [7], accompanied by impaired subunit interactions and decreased affinity for the thiol substrate GSH. We targeted the key residue of the lockand-key motif at the subunit-subunit interface of GST P1-1 (Figure 1) in order to search for a synthetic residue that can replace a crucial natural aromatic amino acid. The results demonstrate that the functional properties of the enzyme can be conserved, restored, or enhanced through the proper combination of site-directed mutagenesis followed by facile chemical derivatization of the key residue. Modulation of properties of other proteins can be made by the same general approach, provided that Cys residues can be introduced in responsive sites. This notion is confirmed by previous studies involving engineered Cys side chains [11­14]. Results and Discussion Replacement of the Aromatic Key Residue in the Subunit Interface of GST P1-1 In the present study, the key residue Tyr at position 50 was replaced by Cys. The four Cys residues of wildtype GST P1-1 were mutated into Ala (residues 48 and 102) and Ser (residues 15 and 170) in order to achieve selective chemical modification at position 50. The resulting mutant, Y50C, had a very low specific activity (0.005 mmol min21 mg21), whereas the corresponding Cys-free mutant (Cys-free) with Tyr in position 50 had an activity of 15 mmol min21 mg21. The primary cause of this 3000-fold weakening of catalytic function was considered to be loss of the aromatic substituent of residue 50. Thus, the Y50C protein was treated with various thiol-modifying reagents bearing an aromatic group to find out if an S-substituted Cys residue could mimic the functionally competent amino acids Tyr and Phe. However, none of the reagents with aromatic substituents gave a noteworthy restoration of catalytic function (Table 1). In contrast, alkylation of Y50C with some alkyl halogenides activated the enzyme by several orders of magnitude (see below). This result suggested that the gain of catalytic activity could be optimized by proper selection of a small hydrophobic alkyl side chain attached to Cys50 and prompted a more extensive screening of alkylating compounds as possible activating agents. Therefore, a combinatorial approach was tested, in which the Y50C protein was treated with mixtures of reagents with similar chemical reactivities. For proof of principle, a mixture of ten electrophilic agents afforded

Summary Proteins contain amino acid residues essential to structure and function. Ribosomal protein synthesis is typically limited to the 20 amino acids of the genetic code, but posttranslational chemical modifications can greatly expand the diversity of side chain functionalities. In this investigation, a natural aromatic residue in the lock-and-key joint at the subunit interface of the dimeric glutathione transferase P1-1 was replaced by an S-alkylcysteine residue to give a functional enzyme. Introduction of Cys in the key position inactivates the enzyme, but subsequent alkylation of this residue enhances the catalytic efficiency up to 27,000-fold. Combinatorial modification of Cys by a mixture of reagents facilitated identification of an n-butyl group as the most efficient activator. Alkylation also enhanced binding affinity for active-site ligands and stabilized the enzyme against chemical denaturation and thermal inactivation. Introduction The soluble glutathione transferases (GSTs) are generally dimeric proteins catalyzing the conjugation of electrophilic compounds with reduced glutathione (GSH) [1, 2]. Although amino acid residues in the dimer interface are not universally conserved among different classes in the GST superfamily, the lock-and-key motif is a common feature and one of the major contributors to the subunit-subunit interactions in the alpha, mu, and pi class enzymes [3]. The conserved aromatic key residue of alpha [4, 5], mu [6], and pi [7] class GSTs has been mutated to demonstrate the significance of this key residue. In the functional dimer of the GST P1-1 protein, the Tyr50 residue (key) of each subunit is wedged into a hydrophobic cavity (lock) between helices a4 and a5 in the neighboring subunit (Figure 1). The key residue is part of a highly flexible structural unit, helix a2 and the following loop (residues 36­52), which forms one wall of the GSH binding site and provides hydrogen

a 60-fold increase in catalytic activity (data not shown), indicating that one or several compounds in the mixture had an activating effect of the enzyme. Deconvolution, by testing the components of the mixture individually, demonstrated a time-dependent activation with 1-iodobutane as the most efficient activator (Figure 2A). Bulky ring structures, including benzyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, or maleimide derivatives, activated Y50C % 4-fold. On the other hand, introduction of relatively small alkyl groups activated Y50C up to 960-fold, as measured in the crude reaction mixture (Table 1). The most efficient

derivatives were n-butyl, n-pentyl, and cyclobutylmethyl. Elongating the chain length to heptyl and octyl essentially abolished the activation. Also, increasing the bulkiness of the alkyl group by using the secondary haloalkanes, 1-bromo-2-ethylbutane and 1-iodo-2methylpropane, activated Y50C modestly by 12- and 36-fold, respectively. Restricting the structural flexibility of the side chain of the key residue by using cyclobutane and cyclopropane derivatives gave less activation than the n-alkyl halogenides with the same number of carbon atoms, demonstrating that both shape and mass of the

kanes tested (Figure 2B). The reactivity of the reagents decreases monotonously with the chain length. In contrast, the activation has a distinct optimum at a carbon-chain length of four (Figure 2B). In particular, it can be noted that 1-iodomethane is 177-fold more chemically reactive than 1-iodobutane, whereas the latter gives 160-fold higher activation of Y50C than does 1-iodomethane (Figure 2B). Further, the activation effect of 1-iodoheptane on Y50C is 1920-fold lower than that of 1-iodobutane, whereas the reactivities of 1-iodoheptane and 1-iodobutane differ by 7-fold only. Direct determination of unmodified cysteine residues was also made by use of Ellman's reagent (Table 1). With the exception of the secondary iodoalkanes, all the investigated reagents modified 65%­100% of the Cys in Y50C. Similar results were obtained by measurement of S-alkylcysteines in hydrolysates of Y50C alkylated by 1-iodobutane and 1-iodopentane; the elution time and the ninhydrin reaction in the amino acid analyzer were standardized by the corresponding S-alkylglutathiones (data not shown). These results concordantly show that the differential activation effects of 1-iodoalkanes on Y50C are due to differences in the structure of the alkyl chain rather than to the degree of alkylation of Y50C. In quantitative terms, the activation observed with 1-bromo-2-ethylbutane and 1-iodo-2methylpropane may underestimate their potency, since only 19%­20% of the Cys was modified (Table 1). The action of these secondary iodoalkanes may also be influenced by the fact that they are both chiral molecules that were tested as racemates (the only form available to us).
Figure 2. Chemical Activation of Y50C with Different Haloalkanes (A) Time dependence of the chemical activation of Y50C. Y50C was incubated at 22 C with 100 mM 1-iodoethane, 1-iodopropane, 1-iodobutane, 1-iodopentane, and bromomethyl cyclobutane for different periods of time, 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min; the control, like the samples, contained 10% (v/v) methanol (solvent of the reagents). The activity was measured on aliquots from the reaction mixture. (B) Influence of chain length of 1-iodoalkanes on chemical reactivity and activation of Y50C. The second-order rate constants of the nonenzymatic reaction of different 1-iodoalkanes with GSH was determined at 22 C (:) in 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10) containing 1 mM EDTA. The degree of activation of Y50C afforded by the 1-iodoalkanes Y50C is shown for comparison (D). The specific activity reached after 20 hr incubation of Y50C with a 1-iodoalkane was determined in the standard assay system after removing the excess of reagent by gel filtration.

key-residue side chain influence the interaction with the lock structure. Reactivity of Iodoalkanes versus Gain of Catalytic Activity The iodoalkanes used differ in their intrinsic chemical reactivities, and the degree of activation of Y50C is therefore influenced by possible differences in the extent of Cys alkylation at a given time point. The second-order rate constants for the S-alkylation of GSH were therefore determined with a homologous series of 1-iodoalkanes and compared with the activating effects of the series on the Y50C protein. The rate constant of 1-iodomethane is markedly higher than those of all other 1-iodoal-

Selectivity of the Chemical Modification In order to test the specificity of the chemical modification, different 1-iodoalkanes were incubated with the following GST P1-1 variants: C48 (the mutant containing a sulfhydryl group in position 48 only), Cys-free, and Y50C for different periods of time (Figure 3). The catalytic activity of Cys-free was not affected by incubation with %100 mM of different 1-iodoalkanes for 5 hr at 22 C. On the other hand, the activity of C48 decreased by 50% after 97 and 57 min incubation at 22 C with 1-iodopropane and 1-iodobutane, respectively, at the lower concentration of 10 mM. In striking contrast, Y50C was activated by incubation for up to 5 hr at 22 C with 100 mM of different 1-iodoalkanes. The crucial structural difference between Cys-free, C48, and Y50C is the absence or the presence of Cys residues in different positions. Consequently, the differential effect of alkylation on these three mutants demonstrates that the activation of Y50C by 1-iodoalkanes is indeed due to the chemical modification of Cys50. Mass Spectrometric Analyses For further conformation of the site-specific alkylation, a mass-spectrometric analysis of protein digests was made. After in-gel tryptic digestion of the appropriate GST P1-1 variants, peptide mass fingerprinting of Y50C and n-butyl-Y50C demonstrated the presence of the expected native and modified peptides: ASALCGQLPK (MH+ 987.53) and ASAL(butyl-C)GQLPK (MH+ 987.53 + 56.06 = 1043.59), respectively (Figures 4A and 4B). This was further confirmed by sequencing the modified

peptide after lysine blockage, sulfonation, and postsource decay analysis by MALDI-TOF/TOF (Figure 4C). In the position for the modified Cys50 residue, the sequence analysis revealed a mass difference of 159.17, which results from Cys (103.01) + C4H8 (56.06). No indication of alkylation of positions other than residue 50 of n-butyl-Y50C was obtained by mass spectrometry. Steady-State Kinetic Characterization of Purified Alkylated Enzyme Steady-state kinetic analysis of n-butyl-Y50C, first activated by 1-iodobutane and subsequently purified from nonalkylated Y50C by affinity chromatography, demonstrated that the KM value for the electrophilic standard substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) had not been markedly changed (Table 2). In contrast, the KM value for GSH had decreased by >500-fold and 37-fold in comparison with the values for Y50C and Cys-free, respectively. These results support the notion that the key residue in position 50 secures the tight binding of the thiol substrate [7, 10]. The kcat value was also elevated by two orders of magnitude by the alkylation, and the combined effects of the decreased KM value for GSH and the elevated kcat value thus contributed to the 28,000-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of n-butyl-Y50C (Table 2). The absolute value, 1.38  105 M21s21, is 10-fold higher than that of the ``parental'' Cys-free GST P1-1. Effect of Alkylation on Affinity for Active-Site Ligands In order to further probe the nature of the activation, the effect of alkylation on binding of the competitive inhibi-

tors S-methyl glutathione and S-hexyl glutathione was investigated. Chemical modification of Cys50 in Y50C by 1-iodobutane increased the affinity for S-hexyl glutathione as shown by a decrease of the Ki value by more than 2100- and 56-fold in comparison with the Ki values of Y50C and Cys-free, respectively (Table 2). Also, the Ki value of n-butyl-Y50C for S-methyl glutathione was decreased 53-fold in comparison with that of Cys-free for the same inhibitor. These results show that n-butylY50C has acquired markedly enhanced binding affinity

in comparison with the unmodified enzyme. In combination with the effect on the KM value for GSH, this finding implies that alkylation of the Cys residue of Y50C enhances binding affinity for the GSH moiety as such. However, the elevated kcat value shows that the enhanced catalytic efficiency is to a large proportion due also to the 80-fold increased substrate turnover as mentioned above (Table 2). Effect of Alkylation on Stability of the Protein Furthermore, alkylation affected the physical properties of Y50C. Heat inactivation experiments were carried out at 50 C to elucidate the effect of the alkylation on protein stability. The chemical modification of Y50C with 1-iodobutane increased the thermal stability from a half-life of 1.5 min up to 200 min. In comparison with the half-life of ``parental'' Cys-free, this corresponds to a 2-fold increase (Table 3). Enhanced protein stability following alkylation was also demonstrated by the effect of the chemical denaturant guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) on the enzymatic activity. The midpoint of denaturation for Y50C increased from 0.02 to 0.26 M GuHCl by the S-butyl modification; the midpoint of Cys-free was 0.06 M (Table 3). Selective Alkylation Optimizes the Catalytic Properties The striking regain of catalytic efficiency and ligand binding affinity of Y50C by select alkylating reagents demonstrates that unnatural amino acids can substitute for ordinary residues in a crucial position of a GST. A pertinent question is whether the catalytic properties could be further enhanced since the kcat/KM value 138 6 15 mM21s21 (Table 2) is already somewhat higher than the value 98.2 6 7.5 mM21s21 reported for the most

active allelic variant of the wild-type GST P1-1/Ile105 [15]. Judicious choice of the chemical modifier could perhaps further enhance the activity, but it appears more likely that any further improvements would be obtained by mutations at sites other than the key residue of the lock-and-key joint. The level of improvement of catalytic efficiency is ultimately limited by the diffusion-controlled association (or dissociation) of the reactants and the enzyme [16]. GSTs generally have kcat/KM values % 103 mM21s21, even with their most active substrates, and in the present case, we have consequently reached an activity not far from the highest level that can be expected. A similar limiting kcat/KM value applies generally to all enzymes catalyzing two-substrate reactions. Comparison with Other Methods for Mutagenesis with Unnatural Amino Acids Alternative methods used for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins include engineering of the ribosomal translation system by various schemes [17, 18] and chemical peptide synthesis [19]. However, the targeted chemical modification has the advantage over these alternative methods that Cys in the selected position can be modified by numerous electrophilic chemical reagents, which can be introduced in a combinatorial manner. The crucial issue in the design is identification of a suitable site in the protein into which a unique Cys residue (or an alternative amino acid with high reactivity) can be site-specifically introduced. If susceptible sites are unknown, it is possible to make a mutational Ala [20] or Cys [21­23] screening linked with combinatorial chemical alkylation. Significance Biotechnical applications of proteins may be limited by the chemical and physical properties of crucial amino acid residues. For example, a Tyr, such as the key residue in GST P1-1, may be susceptible to oxidation or nitration under conditions of oxidative or nitrosative stress [24] or have an undesired phenolic hydroxyl group. For exchange of such unwanted residues, recombinant DNA techniques may in some cases be sufficient, but the restrictions of the genetic code limit the number of possible substitutions. The combination of site-specific introduction of a Cys residue complemented with chemical modification

widens the scope of feasible changes [25, 26]. Replacement of Tyr50 in GST P1-1 by S-n-butyl-Cys is an example of successful molecular replacement surgery that apparently conserves all essential characteristics of the GST protein. The present approach to introducing unnatural amino acid residues has been applied to other proteins for gain of novel functional and structural properties [25, 26]. The applications of this method include (but are not limited to) modification of catalytic efficiency, substrate selectivity, affinity for other molecules, and allosteric or cooperative behavior. Other examples of enhanced properties include altered stability in relation to physical, chemical, or biological factors and processes, such as thermal denaturation, organic solvents, and biodegradation. For biotechnical purposes, the chemically modified protein can be produced in significant quantities at reasonable cost, if the target protein is available in large amounts from microbial cultures or other expression systems.

Expression and Purification of C48, Cys-free, and Y50C C48, Cys-free and Y50A were expressed in E. coli strain XL-1 Blue in presence of 0.2 mM IPTG as described by Kolm et al. [29] at 37 C (except for Y50C, which was grown at 25 C due to its thermal instability). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by ultrasonication. C48 and Cys-free were purified by affinity chromatography with S-hexylglutatione-Sepharose 6B, while Y50C was purified by using Ni-IMAC as described by Hegazy et al. [10] owing to its low GSH affinity. The purity of enzymes was checked by SDS/ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing with precast gels (Pharmacia LKB PhastSystem). Cysteine-Specific Chemical Modification Y50C, Cys-free were chemically modified by incubation with 100 mM alkyl halogenide, and C48 with 10 mM halogenide. All reactions were performed in 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10) containing 0.1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2.5 mM EDTA at 22 C. Y50C was also chemically modified by incubating the enzyme with 0.01­20 mM N-ethylmaleimide or 2 mM 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mM DTT and 2.5 mM EDTA or with 0.1 mM 2,20 -dithiodipyridine in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 22 C for different periods of time. The specific activity of chemically modified enzyme was measured in the standard assay system. All Cys modifying reagents were dissolved in methanol. Quantification of the Modified Cysteine The amount of modified cysteine was determined with the Ellman's reagent [30] by subtracting the measured amount of the remaining cysteine after chemical modification of Y50C from the measured amount of the cysteine of the control (unmodified Y50C). The protein sulfhydryl titer was determined by incubating of protein sample with 0.2 mM 5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM EDTA in the absence and the presence of 6 M GuHCl for 10 min at room temperature and reading the absorbance at 412 nm. Determination of Reaction Rate Constant of 1-Iodoalkanes with GSH The different concentrations of 1-iodoalkane were incubated with constant GSH concentration of 1 mM in 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10) containing 2.5 mM EDTA at 22 C. The reaction was followed by measuring the decrease in GSH concentration with Ellman's reagent for quantitation of free thiols. Aliquots of the reaction mixture at different periods of time were drawn and mixed with Ellman's reagent in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM EDTA. The absorbance was monitored at 412 nm with a millimolar absorptivity of 13.6. A second-order plot of the extent of reaction at selected times gives the rate of the reaction. The second-order rate constant is the slope of the linear relationship of the measured reaction rates with the reagent concentrations. Preparation and Purification of S-n-Butyl-Y50C The S-n-butyl-Y50C derivative was prepared by incubating 18 mM Y50C with 100 mM of 1-iodobutane in 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10) containing 0.1 mM DTT and 2.5 mM EDTA at 22 C for 20 hr. After chemical alkylation of Cys50 residue of Y50C, the excess of 1-iodobutane was removed by gel filtration in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8). The S-n-butyl-Y50C was purified from nonalkylated Y50C by affinity chromatography with S-hexylglutatione-Sepharose 6B [10], taking advantage of the difference in the binding affinity of alkylated and nonalkylated Y50C for the matrix. Mass Spectrometric Analyses The homogeneous Coomassie brilliant blue-stained protein bands of GST P1-1 variants were excised from SDS/PAGE gels and digested in situ with porcine trypsin as described [31]. After digestion and extraction, a small aliquot of the peptide mixture was analyzed by MALDI-TOF on a Bruker UltraflexTOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The instrument settings were those recommended by the manufacturer for proteolytic peptide analysis; the matrix used was a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or dihydrobenzoic acid. Sequence analysis by post-source decay (PSD) was done after Lys blockage with 2-methoxy-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole [32] and N-terminal derivatization with 3-sulfopropionic NHS ester (CAF-MALDI

Experimental Procedures Construction of the GST P1-1 Mutants Named C48, Cys-Free, and Y50C Human GST P1-1 naturally contains four Cys residues per monomer. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change residues Cys15 and Cys170 into Ser and Cys102 into Ala, thereby constructing C48. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were applied as described [27]. The mutant was generated in a stepwise manner by three rounds of inverted polymerase chain reaction (IPCR). The pKK-D plasmid [28] containing the cDNA encoding human GST P1-1 (allelic variant Ile105 [29]) was used as template for PCR. The plasmid containing the cDNA encoding C48 was subsequently used as template for constructing Cys-free by mutating Cys48 residue into Ala.

Y50C was constructed by mutating the Tyr50 residue of Cys-free into Cys50 followed by adding six histidine residues to the N terminus of Y50C by IPCR. The histidine tag has previously been shown not to affect the functional properties of GSTs [7]. The plasmid containing the cDNA encoding Cys-free was used as a template for PCR.

The reaction mixtures contained 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 mM of each primer, various amounts of the template, and five units Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the buffer provided with the enzyme. PCR started with denaturation at 95 C for 5 min and was followed by 25 cycles of 95 C for 1 min, 52­66 C for 1 min, and 72 C for 9 min. The program was completed with a further extension period at 72 C for 30 min. The DNA was isolated from 1% (w/v) agarose gel after electrophoresis, purified with the QIAquick kit (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA), and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The circularized DNA was used to transform E. coli XL-1 Blue by electroporation. The entire cDNA was sequenced by using Big Dye terminator kit v1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and ABI Model 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) to verify that no unwanted mutation had been introduced.

Sequencing kit from GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) [33]. The blocking reaction added 68 Da per Lys residue, and the sulfonation added 136 Da at the N-terminal amino group of the peptide. Hence, by PSD, the y1 ion for Lys measures 147 + 68 = 215 Da. Specific Activity Measurement The enzymatic activity of the GST P1-1 variants was determined at 30 C by a spectrophotometric standard assay involving 1 mM GSH and 1 mM CDNB in 0.1 M phosphate (pH 6.5) [34]. The reaction was monitored at 340 nm. Protein concentrations were determined by using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard [35]. Determination of Steady-State Kinetic Parameters Steady-state kinetics of Cys-free, Y50C, and n-butyl-Y50C were investigated by varying the GSH concentration in the range of 0.05 to 50 mM, at a constant CDNB concentration of 2 mM, and by varying the CDNB concentration from 0.1 to 2 mM, at a constant GSH concentration (see Table 2). All measurements were performed in triplicate in 0.1 M phosphate (pH 6.5) at 30 C. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the experimental data with the SIMFIT package [36]; kcat values were calculated on a dimer basis (Mr = 46000 Dalton). Inhibition Studies The Ki values for S-methyl and S-hexyl glutathione for the enzyme variants were determined by measuring the catalytic activities in the presence of 1.0, 1.6, and 2.0 mM GSH, 1 mM CDNB, and different concentrations of inhibitor. The inhibition constants were determined from Dixon plots. Thermal Stability The thermal stability of Cys-free, Y50C and n-butyl-Y50C was examined by incubating 2 mM enzyme at 50 C for different time periods in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 10 mM GSH and 5 mM DTT. The remaining enzymatic activity was measured in the standard assay system. Chemical Denaturation The loss of enzymatic activity of 1.6 mM Cys-free, Y50C, and n-butylY50C was measured in the standard assay system after incubation for 30 min at 22 C in the presence of increasing concentration of GuHCl (0­1 M) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8).
