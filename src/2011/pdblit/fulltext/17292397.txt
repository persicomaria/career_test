Although it has been known for some time that GIcNAc' and ManNAc are reversibly epimerized in the presence of baseI*`, the mechanism of this epimerization has not been elucidated. For the purpose of studying the epimerization mechanism and attempting to synthesize [2-`H]GlcNAc, we conducted the epimerization of ManNAc to GlcNAc in the presence of D,O by the method of Spivak and Roseman2. The product (GlcNAc) was recovered from the reaction mixture by crystallization, and further purified by acetyIation and crystallization. The n.m.r. spectrum of the acetylated GIcNAc is shown in Fig. la, along with a spectrum ofacetylated, unlabeled GIcNAc (Fig. lb). These spectra clearly show that deuterium had been incorporated specificahy at C-2 of GlcNAc, as evidenced by the cohapse of the H-l doublet, at 6 6.18, to a singlet, and the disappearance of the H-2 quartet at 6 4.45. To explain the specifk labeling by deuterium at C-2, we propose the mechanism shown in Scheme 1. Spivak and Roseman observed the formation of at Ieast three unknown components during the epimerization of GlcNAc to ManNAc. The major, unknown component, isolated by paper chromatography, yielded GlcNAc and

We did not detect (by the same methods) any components other than GlcNAc and ManNAc in our reaction mixtures, perhaps because of the shorter reaction time (12 h US. 48 h). Later, Spivak-Hardesty3 suggested that the major, unknown component might be chromogen III, and that it is an intermediate in the epimerization reaction. However, it is difkult to visualize any reasonable mechanism whereby chromogen III can be

were it an intermediate in the epimerization reaction, the epimerization of ManNAc to GlcNAc in D,O would have resulted in deuterium labeling at C-4 (in addition to C-2), and the n.m.r. spectrum of GlcNAc so labeled would contain a singlet in the region of 6 5.2, instead of a multiplet; clearly, this is not the case. Thus, the mechanism shown in Scheme I is adequate to explain the reversible epimerization of ManNAc and GlcNAc. Biologically, GlcNAc and ManNAc are reversibly epimerized by a Z-epimerase found in hog kidney4, and GlcNAc 6-phosphate and ManNAc 6-phosphate are reversibly epimerized by a 2-epimerase found in bacteria5. In addition, UDPGIcNAc is acted upon enzyn&ally by* UDPGIcNAc 2-epimerase (hydrolyzing)6*7, to yield ManNAc plus UDP, and by UDPGlcNAc 2-epimerase' to give UDPManNAc. The mechanisms for these enzyme-catalyzed reactions are not known, but Ghosh and Roseman suggested an enolamine intermediate in the epimerization of GlcNAc and GlcNAc 6-phosphate, and two mechanisms have been proposed for UDPGlcNAc 2-epimerase (hydrolyzing)gs lo. In 1970, Salo and Fletcher9 proposed that UDPGIcNAc 2-epimerase (hydrolyzing) catalyzes its reaction by the mechanism shown in Scheme 2a. We now propose that UDPGlcNAc 2-epimerase catalyzes its reaction by an analogous mechanism (see Scheme 2b). We also propose, in support of the earlier suggestion of Ghosh and Roseman', that GlcNAc 2-epimerase from hog kidney and GIcNAc 6-phosphate Zepimerase from bacteria catalyze their respective reactions by the mechanism shown in Scheme 1. Thus, all the known reactions involving the 2epimerization of 2-acetamido sugars can be accounted for through a unifying type of mechanism involving a tautomerization reaction between the proton on the carbon atom being epimerized and a neighboring carbonyl group.

Epimerization of ManNAc to GZcNAc in deuteritrmoxide. - The method used was similar to that of Spivak and Roseman 2. ManNAc (1 g; Pfanstiehl) was equilibrated overnight with D,O (99.7% deuterium; from New England Nuclear), and the solution then lyophiiized; this was repeated three times, in order to exchange all of the

hydroxyl protons. The dcuterated ManNAc was then dissolved in D20 (3.5 ml), and M NaOD (prepared by treating sodium with D,O) was added to a pD of 11.4. A n.m.r. spectrum was recorded immediately and every 4 h, in order to monitor the deuterium incorporation. Initially, two doublets, at 6 5.11 and 5.23, were observed, corresponding to H-l of the j? and a anomers of ManNAc, respectively. After 8 h, these doublets had collapsed to singlets at 6 5.35 (H-l of GlcNAc, OL anomer) and at 6 4.8 (H-l of GIcNAc; jl anomer hidden by the HOD peak, but observable on cooling, because of a downfield, chemical shift of the HOD peak). Small singlets at 6 5.1 and 5.2 for H-l of ManNAc (B and a anomers) were also observed. After 12 h, the reaction was stopped by addition of acetic acid. The reaction mixture was de-ionized by passage through a column of Dowex 50-W (Hi) ionexchange resin, and evaporated to a syrup. The resulting GlcNAc was crystalhzed from ethanol-acetone (yield: 1st crop, 0.56 g; chromatography' showed only a trace _ of ManNAc).
