Glycan moieties are essential for folding, sorting and targeting of glycoproteins through the secretory pathway to various cellular compartments. The molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes, however, are only now coming to light. Recent crystallographic and NMR studies of proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complex and ER ­Golgi intermediate compartment have illuminated their roles in glycoprotein folding and secretion. Calnexin and calreticulin, both ER-resident proteins, have lectin domains that are crucial for their function as chaperones. The crystal structure of the carbohydrate-recognition domain of ER ­Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53 complements the biochemical and functional characterization of the protein, confirming that a lectin domain is essential for the role of this protein in sorting and transfer of glycoproteins from the ER to the Golgi complex. The lectin domains of calnexin and ERGIC-53 are structurally similar, although there is little primary sequence similarity. By contrast, sequence similarity between ERGIC-53 and vesicular integral membrane protein (VIP36), a Golgi-resident protein, leaves little doubt that a similar lectin domain is central to the transport and/or sorting functions of VIP36. The theme emerging from these studies is that carbohydrate recognition and modification are central to mediation of glycoprotein folding and secretion. The post-translational modification of secreted proteins is a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotes. From genome sequencing it is clear that cells engage many resources in the synthesis, modification and degradation of oligosaccharides. One of the most well-studied systems is the mammalian N-linked glycosylation pathway in the synthesis of secreted glycoproteins [1]. A remarkable feature of this pathway is that glycoproteins in different cellular compartments carry different oligosaccharides which are modified by compartment-specific enzymes. An attractive hypothesis is that the oligosaccharides represent `cellular addresses' that direct progression through the secretory pathway and define the ultimate destinations of glycoproteins [1]. Although many carbohydrate-synthesizing

and -modifying enzymes have been characterized, the `address' hypothesis predicts the existence of compartment-specific receptors that recognize the different oligosaccharides. Several such receptors have been identified as intracellular lectins (non-enzymatic carbohydratebinding proteins). Calnexin and calreticulin are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-specific lectins with specificity for terminal glucose residues on high-mannose N-linked glycans [2 ­6]. ER ­ Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53 and vesicular integral membrane protein (VIP36) are mannose-specific lectins in the ER­ Golgi intermediate compartment and Golgi complex, respectively [7]. These lectins function as chaperones and sorting receptors in the secretory pathway. Secretion of glycoproteins begins with transport and docking of the polyribosome to the ER under the control of the signal-recognition particle. For mammalian cells, the nascent polypeptide is either cotranslationally transported into the lumen of the ER or inserted into the ER membrane. The oligosaccharide transferase complex, an integral membrane protein complex, transfers Glc3-Man9-(GlcNAc)2 oligosaccharides from dolichol phosphate to the asparagine side-chain of newly synthesized glycoproteins [8]. Soluble and membrane-bound chaperones, disulfide isomerases and peptidylproline isomerases assist folding of the glycoproteins within the ER. The calnexin cycle (described below) is central to the qualitycontrol system, which ensures proper folding before export from the ER [9]. The calnexin cycle Sequential action of glucosidase I, an integral membrane protein, and the soluble lumenal glucosidase II removes the two terminal glucose residues from the N-linked glycon, resulting in a Glc1-Man9-(GlcNAc)2 carbohydrate. Calnexin, an integral membrane chaperone, and its soluble lumenal counterpart, calreticulin, recognize specifically this singly glucosylated oligosaccharide and bind the glycoprotein (Fig. 1). The terminal glucose is essential for binding [10], but mannose residues can also provide binding energy [11]. Binding by calnexin or calreticulin retains the unfolded glycoprotein in the ER, permitting foldases ­ enzymes, including peptidylproline isomerases and disulfide

Fig. 1. Schematic depiction of the essential events in the calnexin (CNX) cycle. CNX and calreticulin are central to the quality control of glycoprotein folding in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [58]. Membrane-anchored CNX and soluble calreticulin (not shown) recognize monoglucosylated high-mannose sugars attached to the unfolded or incompletely folded glycoprotein (red line). Interactions of CNX and calreticulin with ERp57 facilitate the formation of proper disulfide bonds in the substrate glycoprotein. The glycoprotein follows one of two possible tracks (blue or green arrows) upon release from CNX or calreticulin. On the blue track, the terminal glucose of the glycan (pale blue) is removed by glucosidase II (Glc II) (ii). Improperly or incompletely folded glycoproteins are reglucosylated (iii) by UGGT (UDP ­glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase), or a mannose residue (yellow) is trimmed by mannosidase I (Man I) (iv). Additional cycles of binding by CNX or calreticulin follow reglucosylation by UGGT; mannose trimming by mannosidase marks the protein for retrotranslocation and degradation. On the green track, release of properly folded protein (example shown is ribonuclease B) from CNX (1) leads to deglucosylation of the terminal glucose by Glc II (ii). ER ­Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53 recognizes the Man9-(GlcNAc)2 glycoprotein for export out of the ER (iii).

isomerases, that catalyze isomerization of polypeptide conformations or exchange of disulfide bonds ­ to facilitate folding of the protein into the correct 3-D arrangement. The disulfide isomerase activity of ERp57, a soluble lumenal protein, is activated upon association with calnexin or calreticulin [12], promoting the formation of correct disulfide bonds in substrate glycoproteins. A dynamic association of the glycoprotein with calnexin or calreticulin exposes the terminal glucose residue to hydrolysis by glucosidase II [1]. The deglucosylated glycan of incorrectly or incompletely folded protein is either reglucosylated by UGGT (UDP ­ glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase), the only protein in the calnexin cycle established as a proteinfolding sensor, or hydrolyzed by ER a-mannosidase I to target the protein for retrotranslocation through the Sec61 channel and degradation by the proteasome [13]. Reglucosylation of incompletely folded or misfolded glycoproteins by UGGT allows another cycle of binding by calnexin or calreticulin and interaction with ERp57. The slow rate of hydrolysis by ER a-mannosidase I and possibly other a-mannosidases is suggested to provide a timing mechanism that allows multiple folding cycles before hopelessly misfolded protein is targeted for degradation [1,14]. These processes ensure that only properly folded glycoproteins reach the cell surface or target organelle [15]. Localization of calnexin to the translocon ­ the site of ribosome attachment and cotranslational transport of the nascent polypeptide chain across the ER membrane ­ is regulated by phosphorylation of its cytosolic domain [16], and

retention of calnexin in the ER is likely a consequence of the highly conserved RKPRRE C-terminal sequence [17]. Calnexin and calreticulin structure The crystal structure of the lumenal domain of calnexin reveals a highly asymmetric molecule (Fig. 2) comprising a globular lectin domain and a long hairpin loop, the so-called P-domain [18]. The P-domain can be divided into four modules, each formed by an antiparallel arrangement of two different proline-rich sequence motifs. The binding site for the terminal glucose moiety of the carbohydrate is located in the lectin domain. Sequence similarity between calnexin and calreticulin indicates that the lectin domains of the two proteins are structurally similar. Calnexin and calreticulin recognize the same carbohydrate determinants [11] but interact with different glycoproteins [19]. This selectivity is likely a consequence of calnexin being anchored in the ER membrane and calreticulin residing in the ER lumen [19 ­21]. Addition of the calnexin transmembrane anchor to calreticulin results in calnexin-like substrate selectivity [19,20], and truncation of the transmembrane anchor to yield a soluble form of calnexin results in calreticulin-like substrate selectivity [19]. The P-domain structures of calnexin, with four tandem sequence repeat modules, and calreticulin, with only three repeat modules, are very similar [18,22]. The P-domain is suggested to be involved in protein ­protein interactions, possibly with the protein moieties of substrate glycoproteins [23] or with foldases, including ERp57 [18,22,24].

Fig. 2. Domain structure of calnexin. The 3-D structure of calnexin comprises a lectin domain (blue) and an extended arm called the P-domain, which comprises four repeat modules, P1­P4 (cyan, green, yellow and red, respectively). Each repeat module is formed by an antiparallel interaction of two different proline-rich sequence motifs. The observed glucose-binding site in the lectin domain is indicated by a ball-and-stick model (green). Glc1-Man9-(GlcNAc)2 glycoprotein binding was modeled by superimposing the terminal glucose of the model glycan on the observed position of bound glucose. The resulting position of the polypeptide of the model glycoprotein (properly folded ribonuclease B in this example; magenta) suggests that interaction with the P-domain is likely.

hydrophobic residues of unfolded or partially folded proteins to prevent aggregation; and (2) cycles of substrate binding and release governed by ATP-dependent conformational changes of the chaperone to provide opportunities for the substrate protein to acquire its correct 3-D structure. The single glycan-binding sites of the lectin domains of calnexin and calreticulin provide a mechanism for recognition and binding of unfolded glycoproteins, with recognition of polypeptide portions of substrates by the P-domain providing another mechanism by which substrate molecules might be isolated. Either monomeric substrates or larger aggregates could be recognized by calnexin and calreticulin, but sedimentation experiments suggest that productive complexes involve only monomers of calnexin and substrate [14,28­ 30]. ATP-dependent conformational changes of calnexin itself or perhaps in combination with ATP-dependent binding of BiP, a soluble member of the heat-shock protein 70 family, and other isomerases such as ERp57 could effect binding and release of the substrate in folding cycles. An expanded repertoire of chaperone interactions is possible for Saccharomyces pombe and plant calnexins. In these organisms, an additional 40 amino acids are interposed between the C-terminus of the lectin domain and the transmembrane domain of calnexin [31]. This region binds BiP, thereby coupling directly ATP-dependent protein folding with lectinmediated productive folding of the calnexin cycle [32]. Role of ERGIC-53 in glycoprotein sorting and ER­ Golgi transport Calnexin, ERGIC-53 and the homologous membrane protein VIP36 might participate in a chaperone­ cargo receptor relay in the folding and transport of secretory glycoproteins. ERGIC-53 was first identified as a resident ER ­Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) protein [33]. Yeast orthologs of ERGIC-53 were recently identified [34] and amino acid sequence comparisons identified vesicular integral membrane protein 36 (VIP36) as a homolog of ERGIC-53 [35]. The similarity of these proteins to legume lectins was recognized from sequence profile searches and secondary structure predictions [35,36]. Subsequent studies confirmed the carbohydrate-binding properties of ERGIC-53 and VIP36 [7]. ERGIC-53 was demonstrated to be a mannose-specific, Ca2þ-dependent lectin [36]. Secretion of several proteins was shown to be ERGIC-53-dependent. For example, binding to the cysteine proteinase cathepsin-Z is dependent on a functional carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) in ERGIC-53 and on glycosylation of cathepsin-Z [37]. Monomeric ERGIC-53 is capable of binding cathepsin-Z, but transport of the glycoprotein out of the ER is dependent on oligomerization of ERGIC-53. Site-directed mutations based on sequence comparisons with legume lectins demonstrated functional similarity between ERGIC-53 and legume lectins [38]. The 3-D structure of the CRD of rat ERGIC-53 was recently reported, confirming its structural similarity to legume lectins [39]. Metal ions, typically Mn2þ and Ca2þ, are frequently involved in ligand binding in legume lectins. ERGIC-53 requires Ca2þ for ligand binding [38]. The ERGIC-53 crystals were grown in the absence of Ca2þ and

Modeling of glycoprotein (e.g. ribonuclease B; Fig. 2) binding to calnexin with the terminal glucose of the Glc1-Man9-(GlcNAc)2 glycan anchored in the identified glucose-binding site in the lectin domain places the polypeptide of the glycoprotein in an ideal position to interact with the P-domain of calnexin. Flexibility in the glycosidic bonds of the glycan and in the P-domain might facilitate and optimize interactions between the P-domain and the unfolded or partially folded glycoprotein. NMR studies demonstrated that the interaction between the calreticulin P-domain and ERp57 occurs at the tip of the terminal repeat module (the equivalent of P4 in calnexin) [25]. The chaperone function of calnexin also requires Ca2þ and Mg-ATP as cofactors. Although association of the substrate with calnexin is Ca2þ-dependent, the only Ca2þ observed in the crystal structure is far from the ligandbinding site and appears to play a structural role in stabilizing the adjacent amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments of the lumenal domain [18]. ATP-dependent conformational changes of calnexin have also been demonstrated in vitro [26], but no data have been presented that elucidate the nature of these conformational changes. Whether calnexin has an ATPase activity or whether a calnexin-associated protein provides this function remains unresolved. Collectively, these observations suggest that calnexin functions as a chaperone with the general principles of chaperone-assisted folding envisaged for other classes of chaperones such as GroEL and GroES [27]. The major principles of chaperone function are: (1) binding of exposed

mannose, prohibiting direct observation of ligand binding [40]. Inspection of the molecular surface and superposition of legume lectin ­ mannose complexes, however, indicates the likely location of the ligand-binding site [39]. A deep, negatively charged pocket in the molecular surface is proposed to be the ligand-binding site (Fig. 3a). Superposition of the pea lectin ­ mannose complex (protein data bank code 1RIN [41]) onto ERGIC-53 places Mn2þ and Ca2þ and the bound mannose into this pocket. Metal ion and mannose-binding aspartate residues in the pea lectin superimpose well onto conserved aspartate residues in ERGIC-53 (Fig. 3b). Asp81 of the pea lectin participates in a cis peptide bond and binds directly to the mannose. Like Asp81, its ERGIC-53 counterpart, Asp129, also participates in a cis peptide bond. Mutation of the human ERGIC-53 equivalent of Asp129 eliminated mannose binding [38]. Asp160 of ERGIC-53 superimposes onto pea lectin Asp121, whose side-chain coordinates both Ca2þ and Mn2þ. Asn125 of pea lectin coordinates Ca2þ and hydrogen bonds to the mannose residue, but does not superimpose on Asn164, the rat ERGIC-53 equivalent residue. Asn164 is at the end of a b-strand and is followed by a disordered loop (residues 165­ 170). Mutation to alanine of the equivalent residue of human ERGIC-53 abolished mannose binding [38], implying a role for this residue in ligand binding. These data suggest that the disorder in the loop and the position of Asn164 are a consequence of having grown the crystals in the absence of metal ions and mannose, with a conformational change likely in the presence of these ligands. The Mn2þ in pea lectin is coordinated by Glu119, Asp129 and His136 in addition to Asp121. The equivalent residues of Glu119 and His136 in ERGIC-53 are Phe158 and Ala172, respectively, neither of whose side-chains could coordinate a metal ion. This suggests that, unlike legume lectins, ERGIC-53 might not require Mn2þ for mannose binding [38,39].

Oligomerization of legume lectins is well known, frequently resulting in dimers or tetramers that are dimers of dimers [42]. One mode of dimerization involves the molecular surface on the convex b-sheet opposite the ligand-binding site [42]. A patch of residues that are conserved only among ERGIC-53 orthologs resides on the molecular surface of ERGIC-53 opposite the ligandbinding pocket [39]. Conservation implies a function and, since ERGIC-53 forms dimers and hexamers, these residues might provide an oligomerization interface reminiscent of the legume lectins [39]. Alternatively, these residues might play a role in protein­ protein interactions specific to ERGIC-53 [39]. The cytosolic domain of ERGIC-53 has a C-terminal KKFF motif. The dilysine motif is recognized by COPI coatamer ­ an eight-polypeptide complex which mediates vesiculation in the secretory pathway ­ and serves as a retrieval sequence for recycling ERGIC-53 from the ERGIC back to the ER [43,44]. The diphenylalanine directs ERGIC-53 to ER export sites through binding to COPII coatamer ­ a four-protein complex which mediates vesicle formation at ER exit sites. Role of VIP36 in glycoprotein trafficking Sequence similarity and secondary structure predictions indicate that VIP36 has a CRD similar to that of ERGIC-53 [35] and, like ERGIC-53, VIP36 is specific for highmannose glycans [45]. Sequence alignments show that the aspartate residues implicated in Ca2þ and mannose binding in ERGIC-53 are conserved in VIP36. The precise role of VIP36 in glycoprotein sorting and transport remains uncertain. The highest concentration of VIP36 may be in the cis Golgi network [46]. However, VIP36 oligosaccharides modified by Golgi enzymes have been documented [46], probably owing to retrograde transport of Golgi enzymes to the cis Golgi network [6]. VIP36 might

also sort glycoproteins for transport to the Golgi or provide a quality-control mechanism that retrogradely transports glycoproteins. This could prevent exit from the Golgi until the glycoproteins are properly matured to permit correct sorting to various cellular compartments [7]. Unexpectedly, a retrovirus insertional mutagenesis screen in zebrafish has identified a VIP36 ortholog (mutant hi 472) that affects sensitivity to touch [47]. The significance of this phenotype to the lectin property of VIP36 might be related to the compromised trafficking of a key cell-surface constituent required for touch sensitivity.

Structural comparison of calnexin and ERGIC-53 CRDs The structural relationship between the molecular chaperone calnexin and the secretory cargo receptor ERGIC-53 has only recently come to light [39]. The lectin domain of calnexin and the CRD of ERGIC-53 are among a large group of structurally related lectins [39]. The SCOP classification [48,49] places the lectin domain of calnexin in the concanavalin-A-like lectins/glucanases fold family. Among the other protein families included in this fold family are the b-glucanases, galectins, pentraxins and the laminin-G-like modules.

The sequence identity among the proteins in this large fold family ranges from over 90% to less than 5%. The sequence differences reflect variations in ligand-binding specificity as well as in patterns and modes of oligomerization. The similarity of calnexin to legume lectins and to ERGIC-53 was only recognized upon determination of the crystal structures of the lumenal domain of calnexin and the CRD of ERGIC-53. Despite the low sequence similarity between the lectin domain of calnexin and the CRD of ERGIC-53, 102 Ca atoms from these two domains (227 Ca in ERGIC-52, 247 in calnexin) superimpose with a root mean-squared devi° ation of only 1.75 A (Fig. 4). Characteristic of this large fold family, the ligand-binding site observed for calnexin and that proposed for ERGIC-53 lie on the concave b-sheet of the b-sandwich. The precise locations of the residues involved in ligand binding are not conserved among members of this fold family (Fig. 4c). Ligands are typically bound by residues from b-strands of the jelly-roll fold and the loops between these strands, but the particular strands and loops involved in ligand binding and the structures of these loops are highly variable among the various sequence families within this fold. Figure 5 shows a structure-based sequence alignment of calnexin and ERGIC-53. The alignment was extended to VIP36 based on its obvious similarity to ERGIC-53. The high divergence of the amino acid sequences is readily apparent, as the sequence identity between ERGIC-53 and calnexin is only ,6%. Substrates common to calnexin and ERGIC-53 Folding and secretion of coagulation factors V and VIII are known to occur via interactions with calnexin and/or calreticulin [50]. Factor VIII interacts with both calnexin and calreticulin, whereas factor V interacts only with calreticulin [51]. In the absence of glucose trimming, secretion of factor VIII is abolished. Secretion of both factor V and factor VIII is inhibited by mutations in ERGIC-53 that eliminate glycan binding or mutations that eliminate cycling of ERGIC-53 between the ER and the Golgi [50,52]. This combined loss of factors V and VIII results in a bleeding disorder [52]. Comparison of time courses reported for interaction of factor VIII with calnexin [53] and ERGIC-53 [50] suggests sequential roles for these proteins in the progression of factor VIII through the secretory pathway. The role, if any, of VIP36 in the secretion of factors V and VIII is unknown. Other lectins in the secretory pathway The repertoire of potential glycan-binding proteins in the ER is expanding rapidly. Alignment of the sequences of human mannose 6-phosphate receptor and the b-subunit of glucosidase II reveals the presence of a mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain in glucosidase, a domain known to recognize N-glycans [54]. The function of the b-subunit of glucosidase II is poorly understood, but it stabilizes the catalytic a-subunit [50] and provides the C-terminal ER-localization HDEL sequence. The predicted glycan (mannose) recognition by the glycosidase II b-subunit might greatly increase the efficiency of the calnexin cycle [54]. Another ER protein, OS-9 [54,55], also

has a mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain of unknown function. Finally, Htm1p in yeast and EDEM in mammalian cells ­ type II membrane proteins with high sequence identity to ER a-mannosidase I but no known enzymatic activity ­ are postulated to be mannose-specific lectins required to present misfolded glycoproteins to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway [56,57]. The mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domains and the ER mannosidase domains are not, however, structurally related to calnexin, ERGIC-53 or VIP36 (compare Figs 4a,b,d). Summary The structural similarities of calnexin, calreticulin, ERGIC-53 and VIP36 and their roles in the folding and secretion of glycoproteins suggest that homologous lectins are instrumental in the progression of glycoproteins through the secretory pathway. Mutations in the known individual components of this pathway affect secretion of only a subset of all glycoproteins. This suggests that either there are alternative secretory routes or that there exist several as yet unidentified lectins with roles in mediating progression of specific glycoproteins through the secretory pathway. Genomics and proteomics approaches might identify other members of this group of animal lectins recognizable as such by sequence comparisons. Given that the structural similarity between calnexin, calreticulin and ERGIC-53 was undetectable by sequence comparisons, it seems likely that determination of 3-D structures of other components of the secretory pathway will identify structural relationships that are not currently recognized. Structural alignment of the large number of diverse amino acid sequences that are now known to adopt the legume lectin fold provides an opportunity to generate a signature template which could be used to probe genome sequences for previously unrecognized lectins.
