The high-resolution structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the retroviral capsid protein (CA) of Mason­Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV), a member of the betaretrovirus family, has been determined by NMR. The MPMV NTD CA structure is similar to the other retroviral capsid structures and is characterized by a six -helix bundle and an N-terminal -hairpin, stabilized by an interaction of highly conserved residues, Pro1 and Asp57. Since the role of the -hairpin has been shown to be critical for formation of infectious viral core, we also investigated the functional role of M-PMV -hairpin in two mutants (i.e., P1NTDCA and D57ANTDCA) where the salt bridge stabilizing the wild-type structure was disrupted. NMR data obtained for these mutants were compared with those obtained for the wild type. The main structural changes were observed within the -hairpin structure; within helices 2, 3, and 5; and in the loop connecting helices 2 and 3. This observation is supported by biochemical data showing different cleavage patterns of the wild-type and the mutated capsid­nucleocapsid fusion protein (CANC) by M-PMV protease. Despite these structural changes, the mutants with disrupted salt bridge are still able to assemble into immature, spherical particles. This confirms that the mutual interaction and topology within the -hairpin and helix 3 might correlate with the changes in interaction between immature and mature lattices.

NMR Structure of M­PMV NTD CA Protein

101 N-tropic murine leukemia virus,16 B-tropic murine leukemia virus (B-MLV),10 and Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV)11 solved to date are composed of six to seven -helices with almost identical topology. In addition, the N-terminal regions form welldefined -hairpin structures, with the exception of the NTD CA protein structures of RSV and EIAV solved by NMR and X-ray, respectively, where the -hairpin is missing. The -hairpins are formed only upon Gag polyprotein processing, during which the N-terminal proline is released, and the structure is then stabilized by formation of a salt bridge between the released proline and a highly conserved aspartate D51 in HIV-1,6 D52 in RSV,9 D54 in HTLV-1,3 and D54 in N-tropic murine leukemia virus.16 Point mutations throughout this region block the proteolytic processing of HIV-1,14 Moloney murine leukemia virus,17 and M-PMV 18 and affect the virus core assembly and infectivity of HIV-114,19­21 and MPMV.18 Although the mutation data suggest that hairpin formation is important for viral maturation and proper core assembly, its exact role remains unclear. von Schwedler et al. suggested that the proteolytic refolding and formation of the -hairpin creates a new CA­CA interface in the mature capsid core.14 This model is supported by the data obtained also for HIV-114,15,20 and M-PMV,22 which indicates that the formation of the -hairpin structure can shift the assembly from immature, spherical particles, when the -hairpin is absent, to mature, tubular cores, when the -hairpin is present. However, structuring of the -hairpin is not crucial for the assembly of immature particles, since deletion of the entire -hairpin (20CANC) does not prevent virus assembly into the spherical particles (M.R., unpublished data). In their X-ray crystal structure, Mortuza et al. first showed a hexameric arrangement of B-MLV NTD CA and suggested that six -hairpins might form an extended interaction network within the mature CA hexamer.16 Recently, based on results of electron cryomicroscopy and image analysis of hexameric arrays of full-length HIV-1 CA, GanserPornillos et al. proposed that the -hairpin may stabilize assembly-competent conformations of important residues in helices 1 and 2 of HIV-1 NTD CA and/or that -hairpin formation disrupts interactions that stabilize the immature lattice.23 Here, we present the NMR structure of NTD CA of a Betaretroviridae family member, M-PMV, with a special focus on a missing piece in the mosaic of available information, namely, the comparison of the wild type with the constructs where residues critical for -hairpin formation were mutated. The structure of the wild-type (WT) NTD CA, composed of six helices and an N-terminal -hairpin, stabilized by an interaction of Pro1 and Asp57, is very similar to the other retroviral NTD CA structures. We also show the NMR data of two mutants, P1 NTD CA and D57A NTD CA. Both mutations dramatically influenced the structure within the region of hairpin and helices 3 and 5, which then became susceptible to cleavage by M-PMV protease. The effect of the mutations was investigated also in the

Introduction
Mason­Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) belongs to a family of betaretroviruses that are characterized by an assembly of immature viral particles in the cytoplasm prior to their transport to the plasma membrane and budding from the infected cells. Similar to other retroviruses, M-PMV is an enveloped virus with two copies of genomic RNA packed within a mature core. In contrast to the C-type retroviruses, for which human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) may serve as a prototype, assembly of the D-type Mason­Pfizer monkey virus is driven by polymerization of Gag polyproteins within the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Resulting immature spherical particles are transported and bud through the plasma membrane. A viral protease cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursors, enabling formation of infectious virions outside of the infected cell. The mature, cylindrical core of M-PMV contains a major structural protein, the capsid protein CA (p27). This protein is initially synthesized as a part of the Gag polyprotein precursor, from which it is released by a proteolytic cleavage together with matrix protein MA (p10), phosphoprotein (pp24), protein p12, nucleocapsid protein NC (p14), and protein p4. Three of these structural proteins, namely MA, CA, and NC, are common to all retroviruses. After the proteolytic cleavage, the proteins rearrange to form the mature, infectious virions. The matrix protein remains associated with the viral membrane in mature virions. Recently, it has been shown that the M-PMV matrix protein interacts with Tctex-1 and, through the dynein motor machinery, mediates the transport to the cytoplasmic assembly site.1 The capsid protein forms the protein core that surrounds the nucleocapsid­RNA complex together with the viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase and integrase. Although assembly of the immature retrovirus particles occurs at different places, their shape is spherical regardless of the virus type. In contrast, the shape of a mature retroviral core varies significantly among different genera: cylindrical shape is observed in Betaretroviridae (M-PMV), conical in Lentiviridae (HIV-1), and spherical in Alpharetroviridae, Gammaretroviridae, Deltaretroviridae, and Spumaretroviridae. Although the retroviral capsid proteins do not exhibit significant sequence similarity, the tertiary structures of all three-dimensional structures solved to date are remarkably similar.2­11 Retroviral CA proteins are composed of two structural domains, the N-terminal assembly domain (NTD) and the C-terminal dimerization domain, connected by short flexible linkers.5,6,12 Mutational analyses have demonstrated that changes in the NTD affect especially the mature core assembly, while mutations in the C-terminal dimerization domain influence the formation of immature particles.13­15 All structures of the N-terminal domains of retroviral capsid proteins of HIV-1,5,6,12 Rous sarcoma virus (RSV),2,9 human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV),3,8 equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV),7

Despite the structural changes of the NTD CA, both mutations introduced into the CANC fusion protein resulted in the assembly of spherical immature particles, suggesting that the exact wild-type-like positions of helices 1 to 3 and helix 5 of M-PMV CA are not crucial for their assembly.

NMR Structure of M­PMV NTD CA Protein

Results
Solution structure of M-PMV NTD CA The three-dimensional structure of the M-PMV NTD CA was calculated based on nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) distances, backbone  and  dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds, and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) as described in Materials and Methods. Table 1 shows a summary of the restraints used for the structure calculation. The superposition of 10 structures with the lowest energy is shown in Fig. 1, and their structure quality statistics is summarized in Table 1 (for additional structural statistics, see Supplementary Table S1). No distance and dihedral angle restraints were violated among 50 structures with the lowest energy deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 2kgf). The Q-factor for RDCs was 0.225. The axial component (normalized to the H­N bond) and rhombicity of the RDC tensor optimized during the structure calculation were -8.73 ± 0.19 Hz and 0.45 ± 0.04, respectively. These values are close to those determined from the RDC distribution. WHATIF Z-scores were superior to those calculated for NMR structures of related retroviral capsid proteins (PDB codes 1g03 and 1gwp), with the exception of RSV (PDB code 1d1d, Z-score of -2.7). Backbone torsion angles of five residues occasion-

ally occurred in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot: Asp97 in four structures; Thr102 in two structures; Arg14, Asp117, and Val137 in one structure. With the exception of Arg14, these residues are located in the loop or terminal regions (see below). The negative WHATIF Z-scores in Table 1 reflect somewhat lower quality of the refined structures with respect to the reliable X-ray structures in the PDB database. Figure 2 shows a ribbon diagram of the structure with the lowest energy. The M-PMV NTD CA structure is characterized by a five-membered -helical bundle with helical axes in an antiparallel arrangement and by an N-terminal -hairpin. Helices of the bundle are formed by residues 21­33 (helix 1), residues 39­48 (helix 2), residues 55­65 (helix 3), residues 69­92 (helix 4), and residues 118­132 (helix 6). The last two helices of the bundle are connected through a 24-residue chain including a partially ordered loop (residues 93­109) and a short -helix (helix 5, residues 110­114). Among the retroviral capsid proteins, this region is the least conserved and significantly varies in length.9 The N-terminal -hairpin, whose strands are formed by residues 2­7 and 11­16, is in a parallel arrangement to the axes of the -helices. The orientation of the -hairpin with respect to the -helical core is determined by 14 NOEs defining distances between residues 2­52, 4­52, 2­53, 16­110, and 2­114 and positioning Pro1 near to Asp57. The close proximity of Pro1 and Asp57 indicates the salt-bridge formation between positively charged Pro1 and negatively charged Asp57. Backbone

of residues of the -hairpin decreased from 0.84 for Val2 to 0.57 for Ala12, and then increased again to 0.82 for His15. It is in a good agreement with a model involving Pro1 bound to Asp57 and hairpin with increased flexibility in the turn region. Relaxation data were interpreted in terms of overall tumbling, described by an asymmetric diffusion tensor; of internal motions, characterized by generalized order parameter S2, internal correlation time, relaxation exchange rate Rex, order parameter for the fast motion, and the internal correlation time for the slow motion; and of overall tumbling, described by an asymmetric diffusion tensor. Its determined principal elements were 11.176 , 13.160 , and 16.088 s-1. Residues exhibiting slow conformational exchange, including Pro1, the loop between -hairpin and helix 1 (residues 16­ 20), a partially ordered loop between helix 4 and helix 5 (residues 103­109 and 111), residues of helix 6 (119, 120, 122, 125), and residues 36, 57, 60, 70­72, 79, 91, 93, and 94, were identified by analysis of spectral densities.25 The average value of the generalized order parameter S2 was equal to 0.91 ± 0.13. Lower S2 values, indicating higher flexibility, were determined in helix 5, in loops, and in the C-terminal region, reflecting increased flexibility on the nanosecond/picosecond timescale. All parameters fitted in the analysis of the internal dynamics can be found in Supplementary Fig. S7.

Values of the harmonic mean rotation correlation time predicted by the HYDRONMR calculation were compared with the experimental values derived from the relaxation measurements. In an ensemble of 50 refined structures with the lowest energy, the predicted values were close to the experimental correlation time for the structures with the least compact shape (Fig. 1). An alternative explanation of the difference between predicted and experimental rotation correlation time might be partial multimerization of the protein.26 However, no evidence of oligomerization was observed in dilution experiments and measurements of the 1 H­15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra using 1.0 and 0.05 mM samples (Supplementary Fig. S1). Salt-bridge point mutations As shown recently, destabilization of -hairpin in M-PMV CA, by mutation of either P1 or D57 (equivalent to D51 in HIV-1), has a dramatic effect on the formation of the mature core of the released virus and completely blocks its infectivity.18 To elucidate whether the mutations altered the structure of the CA NTD, the combined chemical shift perturbations (CCSP) of backbone amide groups were monitored in NMR spectra of a CA NTD mutant with deletion of N-terminal proline

(P1 CA NTD) and of CA NTD containing D57A replacement (D57A CA NTD) (Supplementary Fig. S6). The 1H­15N HSQC spectra of both mutants exhibited a large dispersion of chemical shifts in the proton dimension, indicating that both mutants are well ordered (Supplementary Fig. S2). Assignments of the 1 HN, 15 N, 13 C  , and 13 C  nuclei were obtained from HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH spectra. Of 135 possible 1HN and 15N resonances, 127 and 68 were obtained for P1 CA NTD and D57A CA NTD, respectively. In contrast to the WT CA NTD, His15 and Phe19 of the P1 mutant could not be assigned, while Gly69, not assigned in the wild type, was identified unambiguously. The Pro1 deletion resulted in substantial peak displacement, with CCSP higher than 0.1 ppm for residues Trp52, Thr54, Leu61, Met114, and Gln115 located in the loop between helices 2 and 3, in helix 3, and in helix 5. Residues 18, 48, 56, 57, and 59, positioned within the loops between -hairpin and helix 1 and helices 2 and 3, display CCSP between 0.06 and 0.1 ppm. The smallest peak displacement is exhibited by residues 70­110 (on average, 0.01 ppm) located in helix 4 and a long partially ordered loop. Differences between the D57A mutant and the WT CA NTD 1H­15N HSQC spectra were more dramatic as 77 residues were not assigned: 2­27, 40, 45­ 54, 56­61, 68, 69, 90­96, 100, 106, 110, 116, 117, and 119­128. The CCSP of the D57A mutant is higher than 0.1 ppm for 10 residues (29, 32, 62, 65, 112­115, 130, and 132), whereas for 9 residues (30, 44, 63, 71, 74, 80, 82, 109, and 129) the CCSP is in the 0.06 to 0.1 ppm range. A ribbon representation of the WT CA NTD colorcoded according to CCSP induced by P1 and D57A mutation is shown in Fig. 4a and b for P1 NTD CA and D57A CA NTD, respectively. Residues without backbone amide group assignment in WT

CA NTD and proline residues are in gray color, while residues that could be assigned in the wild type but not in a particular mutant are colored magenta. Residues with CCSP N 0.1 are shown in red and residues with CCSP b 0.1 are colored using blue­green­red coding. To assess ordering at the secondary-structure level of the studied variants of NTD CA, far-UV CD spectra were measured. All proteins showed one maximum at 195 nm and double minima at 208 and 222 nm, which are typical of -helical structures. The far-UV CD spectra of measured proteins slightly differed in the 222/208 ratio and also in the intensity, suggesting that the inserted mutations may have an effect on the specific packing of amino acids in the secondary structure of mutant variants, especially on the overall number of amino acids contributing to the -helical and -sheet content (Supplementary Fig. S3). The secondary structures of CA NTD mutants as well as WT CA NTD determined from the CD spectra are listed in Table 2. Quantitative evaluation of the content of helical and -sheet parts of the protein structure revealed a small secondary-structure variation among the measured proteins. The proportion of the -sheet is lower in D57A CA NTD (11.0%) and P1 CA NTD (12.4%) in comparison with WT CA NTD (14.7%), while somewhat higher helical content was estimated for both mutants.

Despite the large CCSP values indicating substantial variations of tertiary structure introduced by the mutations, the assigned chemical shifts did not reveal any significant changes at the secondarystructure level (see Supplementary Fig. S8). Although the predicted content of helices from the chemical shifts is higher than the estimation obtained by the analysis of CD spectra, both results showed that the mutations did not disrupt the secondary structure of CA NTD. The NMR data showing the dramatic change of the overall structure of D57A CA NTD correlate with our finding that this mutation caused an improper processing of the Gag polyprotein during virus maturation.18 This suggests that the D57A mutation might influence not only the CA NTD structure itself but also the folding of adjacent regions within the Gag polyprotein. While the function of the N-terminal proline (P1) as a "shape determinant," whose masking by a short extension redirects the assembly from spherical to tubular structure, is well known for HIV-1,14,20 M-PMV,22 and RSV,27 the role of its interacting partner (i.e., aspartate residue) was not studied in detail. To examine whether the D57 residue can affect the

shape of the M-PMV virus-like particles similarly to P1, D57A mutation was introduced into M-PMV CANC fusion protein. A bacterial expression/ assembly system and an in vitro assembly assay28 were employed to study the effect of the introduced mutation. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with these constructs, and the thin sections of the cells expressing the P1CANC or CANCD57A proteins were analyzed by electron microscopy. Structures closely resembling immature (spherical) particles for both P1CANC and CANCD57A were observed within the bacterial intracytoplasmic inclusions (not shown). To analyze the ability to assemble in vitro into organized structures, both P1CANC and CANCD57A proteins were purified as described in Materials and Methods, mixed with nucleic acid, and dialyzed against the assembly buffer. The negatively stained protein samples were investigated by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5, CANCD57A forms spherical particles similar to those assembled from P1CANC. This result indicates that blocking the salt-bridge formation by D57A replacement produced particles with the same phenotype as particles produced from the constructs in which the N-terminal proline was removed. A mutation of either of these amino acids switches both the bacterial and the in vitro assembly of CANC fusion protein from tubular, mature-like to spherical, immature-like particles. We previously showed that M-PMV CANC protein is cleaved by M-PMV protease into the CA and NC proteins; however, CA is further cleaved within the major homology region to yield a 17 -kDa cleavage product.29 To analyze whether the mutations that induce structural changes of CA affect the processing pattern, in vitro cleavage of purified WT CANC, P1CANC, and D57ACANC proteins with recombinant M-PMV protease was carried out (Fig. 6). Products corresponding to a specific cleavage of the WT CANC between CA and NC as well as an additional protein representing the previously reported 17 -kDa cleavage product were observed on Western blots in all three samples (Fig. 6b). Unlike the WT CANC, another cleavage product of molecular weight 20,000 that was recognized by

anti-CA antibody was detected in both mutants, P1CANC and D57ACANC. The products of the CANC digestion were characterized by an Nterminal sequencing analysis. The 17 -kDa cleavage products derived from all three fusion proteins shared the N-terminal sequence of CA (i.e., PVTET). Based on the molecular mass determined, this cleavage product was attributed to the 1­158 fragment of CA, reported earlier.29 Edman degradation of the 20 -kDa product, however, revealed the N-terminal sequence IVESV corresponding to the 44­226 fragment of CA. The new cleavage site, PYTLA4344IVESV, resides within the helix 2 of CA NTD. The same cleavage pattern was also identified in the M-PMV released virus with P1A and D57A mutations.18 These results clearly demonstrate that

Discussion
The superfamily of N-terminal domains of retroviral capsid proteins is an example of highly conserved structures despite their low level of sequence homology (Supplementary Fig. S4). The structure of the five-helix bundle is very similar in all retroviral CA NTDs (Fig. 7). The most significant differences occur in the cyclophilin binding loop, connecting helix 4 to the C-terminal -helix, and in the N-terminal -hairpin.

108 The region spanning residues 85­93 of HIV-1 CA NTD is termed cyclophilin binding loop according to its ability to bind cyclophilin A.5 The binding of CypA to this domain of HIV-1 CA helps the virus to overcome the restriction by cellular protein TRIM5. This mechanism seems to be specific for HIV-1, and the CypA-like binding domain varies among the CA NTD structures in length and conformation. Therefore, the variations in this region of the structural models presented in Fig. 7 are likely to be related to real differences in the physical behaviour of the molecules. M-PMV is not restricted by TRIM5 in its natural host cells, and it has been shown that MPMV does not bind CypA.30 However, an interaction of M-PMV and TRIM5 in New World monkey cells has been reported,31 proposing binding of TRIM5 to the capsid protein. Compared with the other CA NTD structures, M-PMV CA NTD has a significantly shorter region reminiscent of cyclophilin binding loop with a single regular helical motif, while the corresponding regions of CA NTD structures of most of the other retroviruses contain two short helices. However, analysis of the measured chemical shifts and RDCs indicated signs of helical conformation for residues 105­107 and 103­ 105, respectively. As the NMR relaxation data revealed an increased flexibility of residues 103­ 112, it is possible that the experimental restraints measured for this region represent an average value for a broader ensemble of structures present at room temperature. Such restraints cannot confine a single physically meaningful conformation in the refinement. It may also explain the lower backbonenormality WHATIF score of associated residues (Supplementary Fig. S5). The N-terminal -hairpin has different orientations in CA NTD structures in various retroviruses shown in Fig. 7. It should be noted that the position

of the -hairpin varies significantly in the ensemble of 50 lowest-energy structures (Fig. 1). The higher flexibility detected in the connection between the hairpin and helix 1 and in the adjacent loop between helices 2 and 3 suggests that the observed uncertainty in the hairpin orientation is not merely a consequence of missing experimental restraints but reflects the real dynamics of the molecule. On the other hand, hydrodynamic calculations indicate that the refined ensemble of structures does not completely describe the actual range of conformations probed by the relaxation measurements. The position of the -hairpin relative to the helical core is fixed by a salt bridge between the Nterminal Pro1 and Asp57 (see Fig. 8 for details) and by the electrostatic interactions of the -hairpin residues (14 and 16) with the short helix 5 (111 and 117). Similar interactions between the highly conserved Pro1 and Asp at the beginning of helix 332 were found in structures of HIV-15,6 RSV,9 HTLV,3 B-MLV,10 and JSRV.11 It was suggested that processing of the Gag polyprotein triggers -hairpin folding that is induced by the formation of a salt bridge. This structural rearrangement is believed to be a morphological switch to formation of the mature capsid. To investigate the destabilization of the -hairpin upon salt-bridge disruption, the effect of P1 deletion and D57A replacement on the backbone chemical shifts of amide groups of M-PMV NTD CA was analyzed. Changes induced by P1 deletion were localized predominantly in the vicinity of residues involved in -hairpin formation and stabilization, but the loops connecting helices 2 and 3 and helices 3 and 5 were also affected. The changes in the D57A mutant were more dramatic as a large portion of resonances, except that of helix 4, was significantly shifted. Many of the changes were scattered

109 tially restored the ability to assemble both in vitro and intracellularly. However, the mutated virus was poorly released and was noninfectious. 19 This indicates an indispensable and probably more complex role of this aspartate residue than only salt-bridge formation. The aspartate replacement may also lead to reduced association of reverse transcriptase with the more loosely packed cores, as suggested by Tang et al.35 The -hairpin stabilization might be common in the retroviruses where a morphological switch from spherical to conical or cylindrical particles occurs. This hypothesis correlates with the finding that in HTLV-1, where such morphological transition does not occur, as both immature and mature particles are spherical, these regions were only minimally perturbed by the saltbridge disruption.33 To summarize, we have determined the highresolution structure of the N-terminal domain of the retroviral capsid protein of Mason­Pfizer monkey virus, a member of the betaretrovirus family, using high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. The M-PMV NTD CA solution structure is similar to other retroviral capsid structures solved to date and is characterized by a six--helix bundle and an N-terminal -hairpin. The structure shows that the N-terminal -hairpin is stabilized by a salt-bridge formation between Pro1 and Asp57. Orientation of the hairpin, almost parallel with the axis of a six--helix bundle, is determined by the electrostatic interactions of its residues with the short helix 5. Besides structure, the dynamics of the N-terminal domain was also characterized using the 15N NMR relaxation data. The structure is relatively rigid, with the exception of a partially flexible N-terminal -hairpin and loops connecting helices. Compared with the other CA NTD structures, a region reminiscent of the cyclophilin binding loop is shorter, having only a single regular helical motif. In contrast, the corresponding regions of CA NTD structures of most of the other retroviruses contain two short helices. Residues in the range 102­113, where a second helical turn could be formed, show increased flexibility, indicating that the measured experimental restraints represent an average value for a broader ensemble of structures present at room temperature. In addition, NMR spectra of mutants P1 NTD CA and D57A CA NTD showed that point mutations of residues Pro1 and Asp57 dramatically affect the structure within the region of -hairpin and helices 3 and 5 and lead to destabilization of the -hairpin. Nevertheless, both mutations, when introduced into the MPMV capsid­nucleocapsid fusion protein, did not block the assembly of spherical, immature-like particles. Structural data also explained that the other putative interacting aspartate in position 50 could not participate in the formation of the hairpin due to its orientation in the helix. This is consistent with the fact that in contrast to D57A, the D50A mutant does not form spherical particles. Both P1 and D57A mutations induced an additional cleavage by M-PMV protease within helix 2, suggesting different packing of the helical bundle.

through helices 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 (Fig. 4b). We can speculate that mutation of Asp57 destabilizes not only the -hairpin but also the interhelical interactions of helices 2, 3, and 5. As mentioned above, the structural changes in both P1 and D57A mutants induced the ability of purified CANC protein to assemble into spherical particles in vitro. This is consistent with the concept that -hairpin is required for the formation of mature core but prevents the assembly of spherical particles. In contrast, the capability to form spheres remains unchanged in both mutants, similarly to the situation where the N terminus of CA is covalently attached to the upstream sequence of the Gag polyproteins and thus incapable of forming hairpin.18 These results suggest that the N-terminal part of CA protein is an important shape determinant, and its correct folding is required for the assembly of immature particles. Interestingly, deletion of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of M-PMV CANC did not abrogate the in vitro assembly of spherical particles (our unpublished results). Both P1 and D57A mutations influenced virus maturation by improper processing of structural Gag polyproteins. Besides the expected products, an internal cleavage site (i.e., PYTLA 43  44 IVESV) within the helix 2 of CA, yielding a 20 -kDa protein, was detected after in vitro proteolytic cleavage with M-PMV protease in both P1CANC and D57ACANC mutants. Therefore, it is highly probable that mutations P1 and D57A, which destabilize the -hairpin, induce relaxation of the -helical bundle, opening an access to this cryptic cleavage site for promiscuous retroviral protease. The effect of salt-bridge disruption by the mutation of Asp in the helix 3 was also studied in HIV-1 (D51A)14 and HTLV-1 (D54A).33 In the latter work, it was shown that the structure of the D54A mutant is exclusively helical and, in contrast to the HTLV-1 WT, no -hairpin was formed. Except for Asp54, the largest structural changes were observed for the N-terminal residues Pro1­Met17 that form the hairpin in the WT HTLV CA. Smaller changes were detected for helix 1, the carboxyl terminus of helix 2, helix 5, and helix 6. These results correlate with our data on M-PMV, specifically the decrease of -sheet content in our CD measurements. The structural changes induced by the D51A mutation in HIV-1 affect most residues of the hairpin and helices 1, 2, and 6 and the N-terminal parts of helices 3 and 7. The structural changes connected with the D57A mutation in M-PMV closely resemble those in the D51A mutation in HIV-1 as the positions of helices 5 and 6 in M-PMV NTD are similar to the CA HIV-1 NTD CA helices 6 and 7. In HIV-1, the morphological switch from immature (spherical) to mature (conical) particle is associated with conformational changes accompanying the formation and stabilization of the hairpin within helices 3 and 6 of NTD CA.34 The replacement of D51 in HIV-1 with glutamate, glutamine, or asparagine (i.e., more structurally related amino acids compared with alanine) par-

Materials and Methods
Bacterial constructs All DNA manipulations were carried out by using standard subcloning techniques, and plasmid DNAs were propagated in E. coli DH5. All newly created constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression vectors for NTDCA1­140 and P1CANC were prepared as described in Refs. 22 and 36. Bacterial expression vectors for D57ACANC were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed Pfu-mediated mutagenesis using CANCpET22b template, constructed as described earlier.22 The DNA sequences coding P1NTDCA1­140 and D57ANTDCA1­140 were amplified by PCR and inserted into pET22b bacterial expression vector (Novagen) between the NdeI and XhoI sites. Protein purification for NMR To define the N-terminal domain of the full-length M-PMC capsid protein (1­226), a limited trypsin digestion was performed. A fragment of molecular weight of 16,271 and the N terminus of PVTET, corresponding to the fragment CA1­149 , were identified using mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. After the initial NMR studies of CA1­149, a flanking nonstructured 9amino-acid-long C-terminal sequence was removed and the CA protein consisting of 1­140 amino acids was used for NMR measurement. The proteins NTDCA1­140, P1NTDCA1­140, and D57ANTDCA1­140 were expressed and purified as described earlier.36 Shortly, the proteins were expressed at high levels in E. coli and purified under native conditions by gel chromatography. To achieve 13C and 15N isotopic enrichment, the transformed bacterial cells were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 13C D-glucose and 15N ammonium chloride. NMR spectroscopy The NMR sample consisted of 1.0 mM 13C,15N-labeled M-PMV NTD CA in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM TCEP, and 10% deuterium oxide. The volume of the sample was 550 l. All NMR experiments were recorded at 295 K on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz equipped with a cryogenic 1 H/13C/15N TCI probehead. Resonance assignment of the M-PMV CA NTD was performed using standard tripleresonance and HCCH­total correlated spectroscopy spectra,37 as reported previously.36 The 15N-edited and 13 C-edited NOE spectroscopy­HSQC spectra with mixing time of 120 ms were recorded to obtain distance restraints. The sample described above and a comparable sample aligned using the stretched 4.5% polyacrylamide gel were used for extraction of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). The IPAP 15N­1H HSQC,38 HN[C]S3E,39 and two-dimensional version of the 13C detected HCACO experiment40 with the IPAP procedure applied in the directly detected dimension41,42 were used for the coupling constant measurements. The 15N relaxation data were measured on uniformly 15 N-only-labeled sample. Longitudinal relaxation time T1, transversal relaxation time T2, and heteronuclear steadystate {1 H}­15 N NOE were obtained using standard experiments.43 The T1 and T2 relaxation delays were sampled at 11, 56, 134, 235, 381, 560, 896, and 1344

where 0.154 is the weighting factor accounting for the different sensitivities of 1H and 15N.44,45 All spectra were processed using NMRPipe46 and analyzed using Sparky (T.D. Goddard and D.G. Kellner, UCSF, San Francisco, CA). Distance, dihedral angle, and RDC restraints and structure calculation Backbone  and  torsion angles were derived from the amide H, N, C, C, and C chemical shifts using the TALOS software47 and used as restraints with a minimal error of ±20°. The CANDID 1.148 software package in concert with XPLOR-NIH 2.1449,50 was used for the initial NOE assignment of unambiguously identified NOE crosspeaks. Subsequently, the obtained unambiguous longrange restraints were used as input distances for the ARIA 2.2/CNS 1.2 software51­53 to obtain final NOE assignment with floating chirality. During all calculations, the intrahelical and -strand hydrogen bonds were fixed by constraining the O­H distance within the 1.8 to 2.3 Å range in the regions identified as regular secondarystructure elements based on TALOS prediction and on long-range H­H NOEs. From the measured RDCs, only those exhibiting the internal consistency within the peptide plane54 and/or in the regular helices55 were used as structural restraints. Structure refinement was performed with CNS version 1.2 using the RECOORD water refinement protocol56 and modified to include the TENSO module of CNS57 for the RDC potential term treatment. NMR relaxation analysis The backbone-amide model-free dynamic parameters were derived using the Lipari­Szabo approach.58,59 The T1, T2 fitting and the model-free analysis were performed using the software Relax.60,61 The average steady-state {1H}­15N NOE enhancement and associated SD were calculated from three independent measurements. The internuclear distance of the backbone N­H pair was set to 1.02 Å, and 15N chemical-shielding anisotropy to -160 ppm. The overall tumbling was treated in two different ways according to the analysis used for the relaxation data (comparison with the hydrodynamic simulation and estimation of parameters of internal motions). For the sake of comparison with the hydrodynamic calculation, the apparent overall correlation time was fitted separately for each residue. For the analysis of internal motions, a rotational diffusion tensor describing tumbling of the whole molecule was applied. The elements of the rotational diffusion tensor were deter-

NMR Structure of M­PMV NTD CA Protein mined using the following procedure. First, based on the analysis of spectral density function values described by Krizova et al.,25 a set of residues not influenced by chemical exchange and/or a large extent of internal dynamics was chosen. Second, the initial values of the diffusion tensor were obtained by the program Tensor2.62 Several runs of the program were performed, and residues exhibiting the largest differences between the backcalculated and experimental R2/R1 ratios in the previous run were excluded from the next iteration until the fitted values of the rotational diffusion tensor elements were accepted by the 2 test. Third, the program Relax60,61 was run to optimize parameters of the internal motions (i.e., S2 and e), with the rotational diffusion tensor initially fixed. In the subsequent calculations, the obtained parameters of the internal motions were kept constant and the rotational diffusion tensor was optimized. Those two successive Relax runs were repeated until a convergence was reached. The refined rotational diffusion tensor was then employed in a model-free analysis of all residues for which reliable relaxation data were obtained. One of the five standard models of the internal motion was selected using the Akaike information criteria.60,61 Hydrodynamic calculations HYDRONMR26,63 was used for the calculation of hydrodynamic parameters. A temperature of 295 K, a viscosity of 9.55 × 10-4 kg m-1 s-1, and an atomic element radius of 3.2 Å were used in the simulations. In order to minimize the error introduced by the bead position setting algorithm, the lowest-value minimum radius of beads in the shell, which does not exceed the limiting number of 2000 beads in the shell, was determined (1.04 Å) and set in the calculations. The uncertainty of the obtained data was assessed from 36 repeated simulations for varied starting orientations of the molecule. Circular dichroism Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Jasco J-810 spectrometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). Data were collected from 185 to 260 nm, at 100 nm/min, 1 s response time, and 2 nm bandwidth using a 0.1 cm quartz cuvette containing the studied protein in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer and 150 mM KClO4 (pH 8.0). Each spectrum shown is the average of 10 individual scans and was corrected for absorbance caused by the buffer. CD data were expressed in terms of the mean residue ellipticity (MRE) using the equation QMRE = Qobs Â Mw Â 100 ncJ

Bacterial expression and purification of the wild-type and mutant CANC Bacterial expression and purification of recombinant proteins were carried out as described previously22 with some modifications. Bacterial pellet obtained from 400 ml of Luria­Bertani medium, harvested 4 h post-induction with 0.4 mM IPTG, was resuspended in 12 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mM Tris­HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 8) containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, Pefablock (Roche), and cocktail of inhibitors (Sigma). Cell lysate was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C, sonicated on ice, and treated with sodium deoxycholate (final concentration of 0.1%) at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000g for 15 min, the proteins were solubilized from the pellet by the addition of 10 ml of buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 M NaCl and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000g. The pellet was solubilized again in 10 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 M NaCl and centrifuged for 15 min at 10.000g. Proteins released into the supernatant were dialyzed against buffer Z (50 mM phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C. Dialyzed material was loaded on the top of a Zn-chelating fast-flow Sepharose chromatography column equilibrated in buffer Z. The bound proteins were eluted with 2 M NH4Cl. The fractions containing the desired proteins were dialyzed against buffer H (10 mM phosphate, 0.15 mM NaCl, pH 7.3) and loaded on a heparin­Sepharose CL-6B column (15 ml). The bound proteins were eluted by a salt gradient (100 mM­2 M); the fractions containing the pure protein were pooled, concentrated to 1 to 2 mg/ml, and stored at -70 °C. In vitro assembly A 60 g aliquot of purified P1CANC and CANCD57A proteins was mixed with 6 g of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (76-mer) and dialyzed against the assembly buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 M ZnCl2, pH 8) overnight at 4 °C using a 1 kDa dialysis tube (Spectra/Por). Particles formed during assembly were negatively stained with 4% sodium silicotungstate (pH 7.2) on carbon-coated grids and studied using a transmission electron microscope (JOEL JEM 120). Proteolytic cleavage Cleavage of CANC proteins with M-PMV protease was performed as published previously.29 Accession numbers Coordinates and NMR restraints were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 2kgf. The 15N NMR relaxation data were deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank with accession number 16234.
