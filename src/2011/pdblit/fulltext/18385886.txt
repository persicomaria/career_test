Received 26th October 2007, Accepted 21st January 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 19th February 2008 DOI: 10.1039/b716535h Bioluminescence in the sea pansy Renilla involves two distinct proteins, a Ca2+ -triggered coelenterazine-binding protein (CBP), and Renilla luciferase. CBP contains one tightly bound coelenterazine molecule, which becomes available for reaction with luciferase and O2 only subsequent to Ca2+ binding. CBP belongs to the EF-hand superfamily of Ca2+ -binding proteins and contains three "EF-hand" Ca2+ -binding sites. The overall spatial structure of recombinant selenomethionine-labeled ° CBP determined at 1.7 A, is found to approximate the protein scaffold characteristic of the class of Ca2+ -regulated photoproteins. Photoproteins however, catalyze molecular oxygen addition to coelenterazine producing a 2-hydroperoxycoelenterazine intermediate, which is stabilized within the binding cavity in the absence of Ca2+ . Addition of Ca2+ triggers the bioluminescence reaction. However in CBP this first step of oxygen addition is not allowed. The different amino acid environments and hydrogen bond interactions within the binding cavity, are proposed to account for the different properties of the two classes of proteins.

Introduction
Many bioluminescent organisms that occur in the ocean generate their light by oxidation of coelenterazine, an imidazopyrazinone derivative.1,2 The chemical mechanism of the light emission appears to be common among all the different organisms that utilize coelenterazine but they often differ in the detailed biochemical process, probably as necessitated by the behavioral function of the bioluminescence.3 The Ca2+ -regulated photoproteins constitute one class of biochemistry. These photoproteins are involved in the bioluminescence of many jellyfish and hydroids, e.g. Aequorea4,5 and Obelia6­8 (class Hydrozoa). These belong structurally to the EF-hand superfamily of proteins9 and their characteristic is that they stabilize a peroxycoelenterazine intermediate of the chemical reaction in their binding site, releasing it for oxidation and light emission on binding Ca2+ .3,5 Another biochemical class is of those utilizing various luciferases10­13 like Renilla luciferase, where the biochemistry is a classical enzyme­substrate reaction where the luciferase catalyzes the reaction of coelenterazine with molecular oxygen to produce the light emission. There is strong sequence similarity among the photoproteins but not to the rest of the EFhand family,14­17 nor to the luciferases.11,13,18 Among the luciferases there is some similarity within the same class of organism but not otherwise.13 Renilla luciferase is the one that has received the most extensive study and is also widely used in other fields of biological research,

such as for a gene probe and for some other research applications. This luciferase was first isolated from the sea pansy Renilla reniformis (a soft coral, class Anthozoa) by Cormier and coworkers.10 In the sea pansy the bioluminescence involves at least three proteins: Renilla luciferase, Renilla green-fluorescent protein (GFP) and a coelenterazine-binding protein (CBP; previously named "luciferin" binding protein, LBP, but more rationally we prefer "coelenterazine" in place of the generic term "luciferin", to avoid confusion with unrelated luciferin binding proteins such as one involved in dinoflagellate bioluminescence19 ). By the end of the 1970s all three of these proteins had been purified to homogeneity and characterized.10,20,21 CBP is a stable complex of coelenterazine and a single chain polypeptide with molecular mass 20.8 kDa.22 The primary structure of CBP reveals four "EF-hand" sequences in common with the superfamily of Ca2+ -binding proteins. Only three of these EF-hand loops (I, III, and IV) contain calciumbinding consensus sequences, and these also align closely with those of aequorin and obelin but outside of these regions there is no sequence correspondence. On addition of Ca2+ to the CBP, the coelenterazine becomes available as a substrate for luciferase where it undergoes an oxidative decarboxylation to form coelenteramide in its excited state, the origin of the blue bioluminescence (kmax = 480 nm).20,23 The green color of the bioluminescence exhibited by the animal itself originates from the fluorescence of the GFP (kmax = 509 nm) present in the light organ.24 The Ca2+ -regulated photoproteins appear to combine in the one protein the properties of the two separate proteins CBP and luciferase. The first property is the coupling in the animal to its neural network via calcium and the other is the catalyzed decarboxylation to the excited state product. All known photoproteins consist of a single polypeptide chain with molecular mass around 22 kDa having a hydrophobic cavity in which is tightly but non-covalently bound the reaction intermediate,

2-hydroperoxycoelenterazine.3,5,26 Recently the crystal structures of obelin and aequorin27,28 have been solved as well as their structures in different ligand-dependent conformation states.29­31 These spatial structures confirm the presence of the 2-hydroperoxycoelenterazine and have given clues as to how it is stabilized within the photoprotein cavity by a hydrogen bond network. This paper follows the cloning of the full-size cDNA of the CBP from R. muelleri and overexpression of the recombinant protein,32 with the goal now to determine the spatial structure of the protein in order to account for how in the binding site, the coelenterazine is prevented from having oxygen added. Despite the fact that the overall spatial structure of CBP is practically the same as the Ca2+ -regulated photoproteins, there are critical differences between the two classes of proteins in the nature of the binding cavity environment provided by the amino acid residues, in the arrangement of water molecules, and of the hydrogen bonding interactions to the coelenterazine.

Experimental
Cloning cDNA encoding CBP Live specimens of R. muelleri were purchased from Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratories (Panacea, FL) with overnight delivery. The poly(A)+RNA was isolated from approximately 20 tentacles of three live specimens using the Straight A's mRNA Isolation System (Novagen). Clontech's SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit was used to synthesize the double strand (ds) cDNA from the poly(A)+RNA sample. The fragment of cDNA encoding CBP was obtained by performing PCR with degenerate primers. These primers were designed using the published amino acid sequence for R. reniformis CBP (LBP).22 Several isolated clones contained the 5 -ends of the CBP cDNA genes. From alignment of these isolated 5 -sequences the new primer complementary to the 5 -end of the CBP cDNA was designed and the full size cDNA gene for R. muelleri CBP cloned by PCR. The cloning procedure is described elsewhere.32 For the bacterial expression of CBP, the coding sequence was amplified using specific primers and cloned for expression in a pET-19b vector (Novagen). Crystallography Initial screening for crystallization was carried out under 384 commercial conditions and by the other methods described elsewhere.35 The plates were incubated at 4  C for one week. Brightyellow rod-shaped crystals (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.35 mm) were grown with 0.5 M ammonium sulfate, 1.0 M lithium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6 (Crystal Screen, Hampton Research). One crystal was cut into several smaller pieces and each was picked out of the crystallization drop using a fiber loop, dragged along the surface of a microscope slide to remove excess liquid, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data set was collected at Se's ° anomalous peak wavelength of 0.9725 A at beamline 22ID of the Advanced Photon Source. A continuous sweep of 360 consecutive 1 oscillation images was recorded with a Mar300 CCD detector at a crystal-to-detector distance of 180 mm with an exposure of 2 s per image. Data reduction was carried out with the HKL2000 suite36 (Table 1). Initial phases were calculated by the Se-SAD method with the program SOLVE/RESOLVE37,38 incorporated in the high throughput structure determination pipeline Sca2Structure.39 Automated model building was carried out with ARP/wARP.40 Iterative model validation, rebuilding and refinement were carried out with MOLPROBITY,41,42 XFIT,43 and the CCP4 program REFMAC5,44 respectively. ARP/wARP and CCP4 programs were controlled through the CCP4I interface.45 The final refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit and the coordinates of the refined model were deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB)46 with access code 2HPS. Visualization and superposition of the molecular structures was performed using the Pymol program (DeLano Scientific LLC). Overall structure The spatial structure of R. muelleri CBP as shown in Fig. 1A, ° is compact and globular with a diameter around 40 A. The structure is formed by two sets of four helices designated A­D in the N-terminal domain, and E­H in the C-terminal domain. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2008, 7, 442­447 | 443

Protein expression and purification To produce the seleno-methionine labeled apo-CBP the transformed E. coli cells, strain B834 (DE3) (Novagen), were cultivated in minimal PASM-5052 auto-inducing media33 at 37  C during 16 h. Most apo-CBP produced was accumulated inside the E. coli cells in inclusion bodies that can be easily isolated by centrifugation. The purification was performed as previously reported for recombinant obelin.34 The apo-CBP sample in 6M urea obtained after chromatography on DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow, was refolded by a 10-fold dilution in 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.1, 5 mM EDTA buffer containing coelenterazine (Prolume, Pinetop AZ) in an equimolar concentration to protein. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4  C, followed by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-10 (Bio-Rad) with a linear salt gradient (0­0.5 M NaCl) to separate CBP bound with coelenterazine from apo-protein. For crystallization the CBP was concentrated in 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.1, 1 mM EDTA, to 10 mg ml-1 .

found to be rotated over 90 compared to the peroxycoelenterazine orientation in obelin (Fig. 2A, B). Coelenterazine-binding cavity The binding cavity is comprised of amino acid residues located on the inner sides of the protein a-helices. Some of these residues are nonpolar, mostly phenylalanines and several polar side chains (Tyr36, Arg22 and Arg19, Lys139, Asp183) directly coordinate the coelenterazine (Fig. 3A). There is a partial opening in the form of a slit between the C-terminus and a-helix G (Fig. 1A, B); this solvent accessibility apparently allows some water molecules to participate in coelenterazine binding. The coelenterazine is situated closer to the protein surface than being more buried as it is in obelin. Interestingly, the side chain of Arg19 extends perpendicularly across the "mouth" of the cavity appearing to act as a lid. The 6-(p-hydroxyphenyl) group is almost protruding out of the cavity and is in contact with numerous water molecules. In fact as just mentioned, two water molecules (W1 and W2) directly coordinate this p-hydroxyl through hydrogen bonds. Lys139 (Helix G) and Asp183 (C-terminus) act as a gate supporting this "coelenterazine-water" hydrogen-bond interaction: W1 is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Lys139 and W2 to the N atom of the Lys132 side chain near the C-terminus (Fig. 1B, 3A). The p-hydroxyl of the 2-benzyl substituent is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl of Tyr36 (Helix B) and the Arg19 NE-nitrogen (Helix A). The C3 carbonyl is surrounded by an interesting net of three water molecules, which form a pyramidal unit involving Arg22 both through a H-bond to the NH1 nitrogen in the side

The coelenterazine molecule resides in an internal cavity, which is surrounded by residues from all eight helices (Fig. 1A, B). The CBP is seen to consist of four sets of helix-turn-helix (HTH) structural motifs, which are characteristic of EF-hand calciumbinding domains. However, only three of them (I, III, IV motifs) have the canonical sequence ensuring the binding of Ca2+ (Fig. 1C). The Ca2+ -binding consensus sequences consist of twelve amino acid residues three of which are at the beginning of the exiting helix of the EF-hand. It should be noted also that there are short b-sheet stretches in all Ca2+ -binding loops and that is characteristic for many EF-hand proteins.47 The C- and N-termini come close together and make contact through the surfaces of a-helices; thus the Arg14 NH1 (a-helix ° A) nitrogen is hydrogen-bonded (distance 2.85 A) to the COO group of Asp186 and the N of Val 185 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain oxygen of Thr18 that possibly ensures a tighter contact between the C- and N-domains. Fig. 2A shows a structural alignment of CBP with the photoprotein obelin. The ° RMS deviation of the main chain atoms is 2.6 A indicating that their overall spatial structures are the same in spite of a low overall sequence identity (22%). However, a clear structural difference is observed in the binding cavity, where in CBP the coelenterazine is

chain and its carbonyl. Altogether, these three waters form a cap over the C3-carbonyl. The N(7) nitrogen in the pyrazine ring of coelenterazine is hydrogen-bonded with a carbonyl from Phe180. The electron density at C-2 coelenterazine position reveals no oxygen addition (Fig. 2C).

Discussion
The CBP and the Ca2+ -regulated photoproteins have the same fold architecture with similar calcium affinity of their EF-hands and with the binding site located in a similar position. Although the spatial structure of a "pre-photoprotein", i.e., one having bound coelenterazine prior to its oxygenation, is not available, and the photoprotein itself contains the 2-peroxy substituted

coelenterazine as against the unsubstituted coelenterazine in CBP, the different molecular structures of the two bound ligands are sufficiently close that we can offer the following explanation as to how the different protein properties might result from certain specific interactions in the binding cavities. The "prephotoprotein" catalyzes molecular oxygen addition to the C2position of coelenterazine to form the hydroperoxycoelenterazine and the reaction stops at this point in the absence of Ca2+ . This intermediate sits in a highly hydrophobic and solvent-inaccessible pocket near the C-terminus of the protein and is apparently stabilized by a network of H-bonds involving His22 and Tyr138, His175 and Tyr190.15 The residues comprising the binding cavity, ° i.e., within 4 A of the 2-hydroperoxycoelenterazine, are indicated in Fig. 3B, C.

In contrast however, the oxygen addition to the coelenterazine is inhibited in CBP (Fig. 2C). The bound coelenterazine is more solvent accessible than is the ligand in obelin. Also, the obelin cavity contains two water molecules whereas the CBP holds five water molecules directly participating in binding the coelenterazine. The hydrogen bonding shown in Fig. 3A, D should result in a net dipole across the ring system as the C3-oxygen is an acceptor resulting in its obtaining a partial positive charge and at the other end of the molecule, the 6-(p-hydroxyphenyl) group and the N7, are H-bond donors leaving them with partial negative charge. Free coelenterazine is unstable in neutral aqueous solution undergoing a slow autooxidation over several hours.5 In an aprotic solvent it is much less stable, reacting with oxygen to generate chemiluminescence. As the "aprotic reaction" is triggered by base the reaction mechanism is proposed to be by oxygen attack on the coelenterazine-N7 anion.48,49 Thus the partial negative charge on the coelenterazine-N7 bound in CBP should render this position much less acidic than in free solution. Consequently the oxygen addition is not favored. In the more aprotic environment of the "pre-obelin" cavity, the oxygen addition readily proceeds to form the hydroperoxycoelenterazine. The two classes of bioluminescence system involving coelenterazine are both subject to control by Ca2+ flux in vivo but in different ways. For the calcium-regulated photoproteins the property of Ca2+ triggering and catalysis of the bioluminescence reaction are packaged in the one EF-hand protein. Probably this would favor a response of light emission on the millisecond time scale, an advantage in the probable defensive function for this phenotype. In the case of photoproteins, it has been proposed that the binding of calcium ions to the EF-hand loops particularly EF-hand IV at the C-terminal, causes shifts in residue positions disrupting the stabilizing H-bond network. With the availability now of the structure of the Ca2+ -loaded apo-CBP (PDB 2HQ8), it should be possible to extend this idea to the mechanism of release of coelenterazine from CBP on binding Ca2+ . Charbonneau and Cormier raised the possibility that the coelenterazine is not released free in solution but becomes available to the luciferase through a protein­protein complex.20 Although presently, there is no direct experimental evidence for such a complex, the higher bioluminescence efficiency found in combination of CBP and luciferase than if the coelenterazine is added to the luciferase alone, would be explained by the existence of a transient formed complex.32 Also, why the bioluminescence system in Anthozoa should be separated into two proteins is an open question. Perhaps the internal CBP environment is constructed for direct biological function: to protect coelenterazine from oxidation and allow ready turnover by dissociation of the product coelenteramide after the Ca2+ -induced light signal, instead of it remaining bound as observed in the photoproteins.

the Renilla-type luciferase. The three-dimensional structures of the proteins involved show that the modulation of the chemical pathway is achieved from particular interactions of the coelenterazine within the binding site. Although these interactions are clear for the photoproteins and CBP, they remain to be better documented for the luciferase case. The stabilization of coelenterazine against autooxidation when bound to CBP has a remarkably simple explanation based on the spatial structure of the protein. Interactions within the binding site shift the pK and thus reduce the presence of the coelenterazine anion, the target of oxygen attack. Support for this idea could be obtained and quantified by computational methods, since this pK perturbation is a ground state property. Further tests using coelenterazine analogs substituted with electron-withdrawing or donating groups, can also be envisioned.

Conclusions
Coelenterazine chemistry is employed by a variety of marine bioluminescence systems. We can now present three instances in which this chemistry is modulated, a technique of control evidently to suit the requirement that the bioluminescence serves for its function in the organism. The three cases presently at hand are, the CBP described herein, the Ca2+ -regulated photoproteins, and
