The three-dimensional structure of the manganese-phosphate complex of inorganic pyrophosphatase from Succharomyces cerevisiae has been refined to an R factor of 19.0% at 2.4-A resolution. X-ray data were collected from a single crystal using an imaging plate scanner and synchrotron radiation. There is one dimeric omolecule in the asymmetric unit. The upper estimate of the root-mean-square coordinate error is 0.4 A using either the oA plot or the superposition of the two crystallographically independent subunits. The good agreement between the coordinates of the two subunits, which were not subjected to non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, provides independent validation of the structure analysis. The active site in each subunit contains four manganese ions and two phosphates. The manganese ions are coordinated by the side chains of aspartate and glutamate residues. The phosphate groups, which were identified on the basis of their local stereochemistry, interact either directly or via water molecules with manganese ions and lysine, arginine, and tyrosine side chains. The phosphates are bridged by two of the manganese ions. The outer phosphate is exposed to solvent. The inner phosphate is surrounded by all four manganese ions. The ion-binding sites are related to the order of binding previously established from kinetic studies. A hypothesis for the transition state of the catalytic reaction is put forward.

Inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPases) belong to the family of phosphoryl-transfer enzymes. There are two groups of PPases that play different roles in cellular metabolism. Cytoplasmic PPases hydrolyse the high energy pyrophosphate (PP,) bond thus removing this side product of biosynthetic reactions and controlling the level of pyrophosphate in the cell (Butler, 1971). Hydrolysis/synthesjs of PP, by membrane PPases is accompanied by proton transfer through the membrane and induction of membrane potential (Niren et al., 1984). PPases occupy a central role in intermediary metabolism. More than 30 cytoplasmic and membrane PPases have been purified and characterised. The enzymes from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and from Escherichia coli have been most intensively studied (Cooperman, 1982; Avaeva and Nasarova, 1985; Lahti, 1983). They have very similar kinetic properties but different oligomeric structures. S. cerevisiae inorganic pyrophosphatase (YPPase) consists of two subunits of molecular mass 32 kDa, whereas the E. coli enzyme is a hexamer with

subunits of 20 kDa (Hansen et al., 1972; Cohen et al., 1978; J o s e and Wong, 1971). The sequence of YPPase has been determined (Cohen et al., 1978) and confirmed by gene sequencing (Kolakowski et al., 1988). Both S. cerevisiae and E. coli PPases are essentially perfect catalysts. The ratio k,,,K,,, (3x10' M s I ) , which reflects enzyme efficiency, is close to the highest level possible for biochemical reactions under diffusion control (Fersht, 1984). Bivalent metal cofactors are required for the activity of PPases. The efficiency of cations as activators decreases in the order: Mg" > Zn2+ > Co" > Mn'+ > Cd". Ca'+ is a natural inhibitor (Butler, 1971). At equilibrium in the absence of metal, about 5 % of the catalytic sites are occupied by PP, (Janson et al., 1979). In the presence of metal ions, PPase catalysis is accompanied by oxygen exchange between phosphate and water. Binding of metal ions to PPase and their role in catalysis have been intensively studied (Rapoport et al., 1973; Baykov and Avaeva, 1974; Cooperman et al., 1981; Knight et al., 1984). Biochemical, physicochemical, and kinetic studies of PPase were reviewed by Cooperman (1982) and a hypothetical scheme of PP, hydrolysis proposed. The scheme is based on general base activation of an attacking nucleophilic water molecule and activation of the phosphoryl leaving group through metal ion complex formation and general acid catalysis. A detailed kinetic scheme for YPPase catalysis was proposed by Baykov and Shestakov (1992), who suggested two possible catalytic pathways with participation of either three or four metal ions. The catalytic reaction involved several steps. Two metal ions bind first. Next, PP, binds to the active site together

Harutyunyan et al. ( E m J. Biochem. 239) with the third (substrate) metal. The fourth metal ion binds either with very poor affinity to the complex of YPPase with two metals or more strongly to the complex of enzyme with two metals, PP, and substrate metal. This provides further enhancement of the reaction. Kinetic constants were determined for all steps of the reaction with magnesium as cofactor. Significant contributions to the understanding of YPPase arose from the determination of the crystal structures of the S. cerevisiae apoenzyme a n t its complexes with uranyl, :erbium, or magnesium ions at 3-A resolution and CaPP, at 5 A (Kuranova et al., 1983; Terzyan et a!., 1984). Even though the structure was not refined, the model revealed the essential architecture of the molecule and its secondary structure. The role of 17 amino acids in metal and substrate binding and a plausible scheme of catalysis were proposed (Kuranova, 1992). Chemical modification of YPPase confirmed the importance of Lys.56, Tyr89, and Asp147 for catalysis (Komissarov et al., 198.5; Gonzales and Cooperman, 1986; Raznikov et al., 1992). Recently, two more crystal structures have been solved for PPases from Thernzus thermnphilus (Teplyakov et al., 1994) and E. coli (Oganessyan et a]., 1994; Kankare et al., 1994). Superposition of these on YPPase confirmed a high degree of similarity in the polypeptide fold, additional evidence of evolutionary divergence of the yeast and bacterial enzymes from a common ancestor. The sequence alignment of PPases from different sources showed that they can be subdivided into two families (Coopernmn et al., 1992). The identity between the most remote members of these families is less than 27%. All 17 residues implicated in the active site of YPPase from the X-ray structure are strictly conserved. There are only six conserved amino acids outside the active site. This supports a common catalytic mechanism for all these PPases. Site-directed mutagenesis of the E. coli enzyme confirmed several residues essential for activity (Lahti et al., 1990, 1991 ; Cooperman et al., 1992). Determination of crystal structures of PPases complexed with functionally important ligands (P,, PP, analogues, and metals) is of particular value for a fuller understanding of the mechanism. The nature of the metal strongly influences substrate and product binding as well as the P,/PP, equilibrium. Thus phosphate binds much more strongly in the presence of manganese compared to magnesium (Cooperman et al., 1981). In this study, we have undertaken the structure analysis of the complex of YPPase with Mn2+ and P,, the product of the reaction. Preliminary results have already been reported (Chirgadze et al., 1991). The refinement is now complete. Four Mn2+ and two P, ions have been located in the active site.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Enzyme isolation and purification. Enzyme purification was based on the procedure of Cooperman et al. (1973). The enzyme was assayed as described in Rapoport et al. (1972). The enzymatic activity was about 600-640 U/mg at room temperature. Crystallisation. Crystals of the Mn*+P,/YPPase complex were grown from solutions of protein in 0.03 M Mes, pH 6.2, containing equal concentrations of both Mn" and phosphate (0.5 mM) and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as precipitant as described in Chirgadze et al. (1991). The crystals were thick needles with a minimum dimension of 0.3 mm. They belong to the orthorhombic space group P2,222, with cell parameters a = 116.1, b = 106.2, and c = 56.1 A. There is a dimer of tbe protein in the asymmetric unit which gives a V,,, of 2.7 Da A-'. X-ray data collection. X-ray intensities were collected at EMBL Hamburg using synchrotron radiation and an imaging

52 plate scanner. The crystals did not diffract beyond 2.4 images with an oscillation range of 2" were recorded and processed using DENZO (Otwinowski, 1993). They were essentially complete at low resolution but only about 60% complete in the outer resolution shell (Table 1). Refinement. The initial model was that previously determined at 3.0-A resolution for the apoenzyme (Kuranova et al., 1983; Terzyan et al., 1984) and preliminarily refined with the present data to an R factor of 25.4% (Chirgadze et al., 1991). In the eresent study, all X-ray data within the resolution range 102.4 A were used from the start. First, the model was refined without stereochemical restraints using ARP (Lamzin and Wilson, 1993). This gave only marginal improvement in the density map, but allowed correction of some parts of the model. Further refinement was carried out wing stereochemically restrained least-squares minimisation with the CCP4 (1994) version of PROLSQ (Konnert and Hendrickson, 1980) coupled with automated building and updating of the solvent structure again using ARP. Refinement was interspaced with manual correction using molecular graphics (Jones, 1978). The refinement is summarised in Table 2. Identification of Mnz+-bindingand Pi-binding sites. The MnZ+and P, ions in the crystallisation liquor were expected to

Further refinement was carried out including the four Mn2+ calculated when the refinement of the protein was deemed to have converged to an R factor of 21.1 %, contained six large and two phosphorus atoms in the model (Fig. 1B). Because of peaks in the active site in each of the two crystallographically the limited resolution, the shape of the density for the P, peaks independent subunits (Fig. 1A). Distances b$ween the centres was essentially spherical and the positions of P, oxygen atoms of these peaks were in the range 3.5-7.0A (Table 3).

The peaks corresponding to P,A (peak 6 ) in both subunits have two small protuberances, which we have assumed to represent the positions of two oxygens. The positions of the other two oxygens in P,A were derived from these. However, the orientations of neither P,A nor P,L are defined with certainty in the present model.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Quality of the model and non-crystallographic symmetry.
Characteristics of the final model are given in Table 2. Only residues 1-282 in both subunits are visible in the electron density map. The remaining four C-terminal residues are disordered. Each subunit contains 2248 protein atoms, four Mn2+ ions, and two phosphate groups. There are 222 solvent molecules in the model, approximately 0.4/amino acid residue. This relatively small number is a consequence of the limited resolution of the X-ray data. The difference map calculated with final model phases has minimum, maxipum, and root-mean-square values of -0.29, 0.51, and 0.05 e A-', respectively, and does not contain significant features to suggest further improvement of the model. The Ramachandran plot calculated using PROCHECK (Morris et al., 1992) showed no residues with main chain dihedral angles in disallowed regions. 85 % of the residues are in the core region. The overall estimaJe of coordinate error from the O, plot (Read, 1986) is 0.37A. The two independent subunits in the crystallographic asymmetric unit and refinement of the model without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints allows an alternative means of estimating coordinate error. In the absence of crystal lattice contacts giving systematic deviations between non-crystallographically related subunits, the root-mean-square deviation between them, divided by would approximately correspond to the coordinate error. Superposition of the twq subunits results in a root-mean-square deviation of 0.36 A for equivalent CA atoms, 0.38 for main chain and 0.88 for side chain atoms. The relatively high value obtained for the side chains is affected by disorder modelled differently in the two subunits. When 34 pairs ,Of side chains with average temperature factors of more than 50 AZwere excluded, the root-omean-square deviation for the remaining 248 decreased to 0.59 A. The disordered side chains are mainly lysines, arginines, and carboxylates on the protein surface. The active site Mn'+ atoms from the two subunits superimpose with a root-mkan-square deviation of 0.16 and the Pi phosphorus atoms 0.23 A. 57 pairs of solvent atoms (51% of the total solvent sites) closely follow no?-crystallographic symmetry with a deviation of less than 1.0 A. The mean temperature factor and root-mean-square deviation from non-crystallographic twofold symmetry for the main chain atoms is plotted as a function of residue number in Fig. 2. The root-mean-square deviation is highly correlated with the temperature factor. A few segments of the backbone, the loops connecting strands or helices (Ala36 to Ile42, connecting p3' and p4; Ala73 to Lys76, p6 and p7; Asnl04 to L y s l l l , PlO and PI1 ; Lys233 to Asp241, a3 and a4) deviate significantly from non-crystallographic symmetry, which is clearly a result of crystal lattice contacts. Thus, for atoms which are well ordered and not involved in lattice contacts, the estimate of coordinate error, obtained as the root-mean-square dFviation from twofold sym; metry divided by is about 0.2 A for main chain and 0.4 A for side chain atoms. This oisin a good agreement with the overall error estimate of 0.37 A derived from the CT, plot.

The non-crystallographic twofold symmetry was not imposed during refinement. This allowed independent validation of the significance of the model as described above. No significant deviations from twofold symmetry were observed in the active site in terms of the P, and Mn2+ positions. The only discrepancies lay in the presence or absence of weakly bound water molecules in the metal coordination spheres (see below). These do not affect the conclusions drawn in this study. Subsequently, 20 cycles of refinement were run with the imposition of non-crystallographic symmetry, with tight restraints on the main chain and weaker ones on the side chain atoms. The R factor increased slightly and there was little change in the density maps (data not shown). No new conclusions could be derived concerning the nature of the active site. The model deposited in the data bank and described elsewhere in the text is that without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints imposed.

The fold of YPPase. The YPPase molecule is made up of two subunits (Fig. 3). The two active sites are about 40 A apart. Each
subunit has a compact globular shape (Fig. 4), and the overall architecture of the initial apoYPPase model is retained, with differences in the definition of secondary structure elements. Some new short p-strands and a-helices have been identified in the present complex and some of those previously assigned in the apoenzyme have been removed. The topology is shown in Fig. 5 , using the numbering given for the apoenzyme. Compared to the original structure, P-strands 8, 12, and 18 are no longer present; @-strands 15 and 16 comprise a single strand, P15; strands 83 and p7 are each split into two shorter strands and two new P-strands 18' and 19 as well as the a0-helix have been identified . The core of the subunit is formed by a five-stranded &barrel (Figs 4 and 5 ) consisting of P-strands 11, 9, 4, 13, and the Cterminal part of pl5. Four a-helices (a0, l , a2, and a3) suru round the barrel and are located at the protein surface. The arrangement of the P-barrel and two a-helices (a2 and a3) is conserved in other PPases with known three-dimensional structure. The second part of the subunit comprises an extensive p-sheet made up of four long (Pl, P2, p6, and P.5) and three short (p18', p7, and p3) P-strands. The P-sheet makes contacts with two short P-strands at the C-terminus (PI9 and p7') and is shielded from the solvent by the a4-helix (Figs 4 and 5) as is the ,&barrel. Although the YPPase subunit clearly consists of the two parts, p-barrel and P-sheet, they pack closely together and do not form

The central part of the intersubunit interface (Fig. 6) is made up of Trp52, Phe84, Pro85, His86, His87, and Trp279, located in t h e C-terminal P-sheet and in the loops connecting the large /Meet and the /I-barrel. The core of the interface includes two pairs of water molecules related by the molecular two-fold and one water molecule located on the axis. These water molecules hydrogen bond to each other and to Pro85 0, His86 ND1, His87 0, and Trp279 NE1.

separate domains. Detailed comparisons of eukaryotic and prokaryotic PPase structures have been published previously (Teplyakov et al., 1994; Oganessyan et al., 1994; Kankare et al., 1994).

Intersubunit contacts. Individual YPPase subunits are compact and globular. The intersubunit contact is relatively loose (Fig. 3).
This explains the ability of isolated and immobilised YPPase subunits to catalyse hydrolysis of PP, at the same rate as the dimeric molecule (Plaksina et al., 1981). There are no direct contacts between the main chain atoms of the two subunits, a few side chains form the interface. In the two symmetry-related halves of the interface, all hydrogen bonds involv? at least ope side chain atom: Arg51 NH2 t,o Asp277 0 (3.5 A and 3.0 A), His87 ND1 to His87 ND1 (2.5 A), and lle128 N to Asp277 OD1 (3.2 A and 3.1 A). The hydrogen bond betwee! Ile128 0 from subunit A and Lys274 NZ from subunit B (3.1 A) does not have a symmetry-related hydrogen bond as the Lys274 side chain in subunit A is disordered.

Active site. The active site is shown in Big. 7. It is a hemispherical depression with diameter about 20 A. The bottom of the cavity is hydrophobic and is made up of Tyr89 (in the loop connecting fl`, the small C-terminal P-sheet, and /19, the P-barrel), Tyr93 (P9 from the P-barrel), Lys154 (PlS from the P-barrel), Trp188, Phe189, and Tyr192 (all three in the a2-helix adjacent to the P-barrel). The rest of the cavity is made up of polar residues. The hydrophobic core is directly covered by positively charged residues: Lys56 (/IS) and Arg78 (fl) from the large Psheet and Lys193 and Lysl98 from the loop connecting the 1x2helix and P17 from the /)-barrel. They are accessible to solvent and located close to the subunit interface. Opposite to the cluster of positively charged residues, the wall of the active site is made up of negatively charged carboxylate side chains. Only two of them, Asp71 and GluS8, are from the large P-sheet. Eight others, Glu48, Aspl15, Aspll7, Aspl20, Asp147, Clu148, Glu150 and Asp1 52, belong to the P-barrel. Essentially all side chains of the residues, which make up the walls of the active site cleft, point towards Mn2+ and P, ions. Thus, 20 residues form the YPPase active site in three clusters : hydrophobic, negatively charged, and positively charged. 18 of the residues, with the exception of GluIS0 and Trpl88, are conserved in the alignment with PPases from 7: thermophilus and E. coli (Teplyakov et al., 1994). The four Mn2+ ions in the active site are referred to as Mnl -Mn4. Residues from the negatively charged cluster play the most important role in binding Mnz+ ions [Fig. 8: Asp152 (binds M n l and Mn3), AspllS (Mnl), Asp120 (Mnl and Mn2), and Asp147 (Mn3)]. Asp120 and Asp152 bridge Mnl with Mn2 and Mn3, respectively. Glu58 binds Mn4 at the base of the cavity. Out of ten negatively charged side chains in the active site, four aspartate groups and one glutamate participate directly in Mn2+binding. All are monodentate with respect to any individual Mn2+, although some form bridging interactions between two metals. The Mn2+ions can be divided into two pairs. Mnl and Mn2 are located at the base of the active site, separated from solvent by the Mn3, Mn4, and P, groups. They interact only with the inner P,A. Mnl has monodentate coordination to a single OD

In subunit B, these water molecules are not observed. Mn2 is in contact with the second oxygen atom of the bridging Asp120 and a P,A oxygen. Four water molecules complete the octahedral coordination of Mn2 in the A subunit but only one water molecule is observed in the B subunit. The Mnl and Mn2 ions together with lysine and arginine side chains create a positively charged environment favouring binding of the two P, groups complexed with the other two Mn2+ ions.

and P,L. Two water molecules are coordinated with Mn3 i n subunit B but only one in subunit A. Mn4 has square pyramidal coordination in both subunits. Besides the two oxygen atoms of the P,A and P,L groups, it is bound to an oxygen atom of the Glu58 carboxylate group and two water molecules. The square base of the pyramid is exposed to solvent. The coordination of all Mn2+ ions is probably in reality octahedral, with the apparently vacant positions occupied by mobile water molecules with too high temperature factors to be observed in the present analysis. The mean values of distances from MnZ+ions to, their ligants are as follows: 0 (aspart$e or glutamate) 2.1 A, 0 (P,) 2.3 A, and water molecules 2.2 A.

P, groups interact with side chains that belong to either the positively charged or hydrophobic clusters in the active site. The distance between the phosphorus atoms of the two P, groups i s 3.7 A and 3.8 A in the two subunits. Thus, there appears to be Fig. 9. Scheme for formation of the transition state. no pyrophosphate but rather two separate Pi groups in the complex. P,A is located deep in the cavity and is partially shielded from solvent by P,L. P,A interacts with all four metal ions and in order of binding. Therefore, Mn2 corresponds to the second with Lys56, Tyr93, Tyrl92, and Lys193. P,L bridges two Mn2+ metal. ions and is hydrogen bonded to Arg78NH1 and NH2, Of the two phosphate ions, P,A is most deeply buried and is Lys193 NZ and Tyr192 OH. expected to be the first phosphate to bind during the reverse reaction, when the substrate metal MI13 and P,A are believed to MnZ+ and Pi binding. The reaction catalysed by PPases is de- bind essentially simultaneously to the dimetal complex. P,A is pendent on the presence of a natural metal activator, Mgz+. liganded by all four Mn2+ ions and its P - 0 bonds should be Metal activators bind to the active site successively and the weakened more than those in P,L which only interacts with two dissociation constant for the first Mg2+ (0.01 mM) is much metals. Therefore, the P,A phosphorus is likely to be that on lower than that for the second (0.22 mM). The third Mg" binds which displacement occurs during catalysis in both the forward much more weakly (27mM; Baykov and Shestakov. 1992). and inverse reactions. P,L corresponds to the `entering' P,, the second phosphate to Binding of PP, or P, complexed with the third metal ion facilitates binding of a fourth metal ion at the same concentration as bind in the inverse reaction and the first leaving group in the that for the second. It is likely that the presence of only three forward reaction. In summary, the last groups to bind in the metal ions in the active site is sufficient for catalysis to proceed. inverse reaction and the first to leave in the forward reaction are However, the catalytic reaction speeds up in the presence of the likely to be P,L and Mn4, which are most exposed to solvent. The presence of two P, groups and four Mn2+ ions indicates fourth ion. The reaction that the crystal contains the product complex of PP, hydrolysis.

Mnl can be i.e. the products of (PO1),NH hydrolysis occupy the same posiassumed to be the highest affinity metal ion, i.e. the first metal tions as the present P, groups. The structural data on the present Mn"-P, YPPase complex clarify some aspects of the catalytic to bind to the active site. Stereochemical evidence, i.e. that Mnl is bound by three aspartate groups, supports this assumption. In mechanism and of the transition state. the structure of E. coli PPase with a low concentration of manganese (Harutyunyan et al., 1996), only one Mnz+ is present and Mechanism. Hydrolysis of PP, proceeds according to an S,2 mechanism (Gonzales et al., 1986). A hydroxyl anion, Ow, atoccupies the position corresponding to Mnl . Mn4 is the metal site most accessible to solvent and is likely tacks the P,A phosphate group in the direction opposite to the to be the fourth manganese that binds most weakly and is not Ob ether P - 0 bond (Fig. 9A). Trigonal bipyramidal coordination absolutely required for catalysis. Binding of Mn4 corresponds of the P,A phosphorus in the transition state is stabilised by to the second alternative pathway for the reaction, described by metal ions and positively charged protein side chains, the combined effects of which weaken the P - 0 bonds. Due to these inBaykov and Shestakov (1992). The apparent accessibility of the metal-ion-binding sites teractions, the phosphorus atom of P,A isodisplaced towards Ow alone does not clearly identify the metal that binds second: Mn2 (Fig. 9B). Such displacement (about 1.0 A in total) leads to rupor Mn3. From stereochemical considerations only (binding by ture of the P-Ob bond (Fig. 9C). The inverse reaction, PP, syntwo aspartate residues), Mn3 could be considered as the second thesis from two P, groups (P,L and P,A'), involves protonation most tightly bound metal. However, Mn3 but not Mn2 is in a of the Ow oxygen on the P,A' group. The P,L group via the Ob position to bridge the two phosphate moieties in the PP, group oxygen attacks the phosphorus of the P,A. Displacement of the and hence must be: the so-called substrate metal that is third phosphorus towards P,L Ob and release of a water molecule

leads to formation of PP,. The same protein side chains and metal ions are presumably involved in both the forward and reverse reactions. The proposed mechanism implies firstly that Ow (P,A') should be most remote from P,L and secondly that the Ob of P,L and the phosphorus and Ow of P,A' should lie on a straight line in the transition state and approximately in a straight line during the subsequent stage of hydrolysis when PP, is transformed into two separate tetrahedral P, groups. The hypothetical transition state is shown in Fig. 10. The leaving P,L is coordinated by Mn3 and Mn4 and anchored by Arg78. The scheme involves the movement of P,A from its position in the present crystal structure to a new position PjA' where it is covalently linked with Ob. The P,A phosphorus shifts from the starting position towards Ob to become five-coordinate. P,A interacts with all four Mn'+ ions. This is the P, that enters and leaves the active site complexed with the substrate metal Mn3. In the transition state, Mn3, which bridges two isolated P, groups in the crystal structure, is assumed not to change its position and to interact with two P,A oxygen atoms one of which is Ob. This introduces tension in the transition state structure since the distance between the positively charged Mn3 and the phosphorus of P,A is short. However, such tension promotes movement of the phosphorus atom towards Ow during hydrolysis of PP,. As the positions of the P,A oxygen atoms are not determined reliably in the present study, it is not possible to define which is Ow and, as a consequence, which is Ob in P,L. However, in P,A the Ow oxygen atom should be that most remote from P,L, i.e. in the region close to Mn2, which is probably involved in the activation of the water molecule. Aspl20, which bridges Mnl and Mn2, forms a hydrogen bond to Lys154NZ, which has a hydrogen bond to Tyr93 O K These residues together with Mn'+ ions are probably involved in deprotonation of the catalytic Ow and protonation of the corresponding oxygen atom of P,A. The structure of the transition state deduced from the present crystal structure agrees with the overall scheme suggested by Cooperman et al. (1 992). However, there are significant differences. Binding of PP, by two bridging metals was suggested by Kuranova and Sokolov (1986). According to the present scheme,

the second bridging metal is not the second metal-activator but rather Mn4 which enters the active site last.

CONCLUSIONS
In discussing the catalytic mechanism, it has been assumed that only minor conformational changes occur when the transition state is formed. Further structures of crystalline PPase complexed with metal ions with and without substrate analogues are essential and will allow a more detailed understanding of the subsequent stages of the reaction. Some crystalline complexes of YPPase have alreaty been obtained but their diffraction extended to less than 3-A resolution (Kuranova et al., 1990). Such studies are now in progress. Different complexes of both yeast and E. coli PPases diffracting to about 2.0-A resolution have already been crystallised (Heikineimo et al., 1995). Crystalline complexes of YPPase complexed both with two Mn2+ ions and (4 Mn" 2 P,) as in the present structure are under X-ray study (Goldman, A., private communication). Several complexes of E. coli PPase have been crystallised by the Moscow group. In addition to a complex with a single Mn" (Harutyunyan et al., 1996), a complex containing two natural metal-activators has already been analysed (Oganessyan, V. Y., Kurilova, S. A., Vorobyova, N. N., Nazarova, T. I., Avaeva, S. M. and Harutyunyan, E. H., unpublished results). Combined efforts will certainly succeed in a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism.
