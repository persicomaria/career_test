Werner syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disease that results in premature aging. Mutations in the WS gene (WRN) result in a loss of expression of the WRN protein and predispose WS patients to accelerated aging. As a helicase and a nuclease, WRN is unique among the five human RecQ helicase family members and is capable of multiple functions involved in DNA replication, repair, recombination, and telomere maintenance. A 144-residue fragment of WRN was previously determined to be a multifunctional DNA- and protein-binding domain (DPBD) that interacts with structure-specific DNA and a variety of DNA-processing proteins. In addition, DPBD functions as a nucleolar targeting sequence of WRN. The solution structure of the DPBD, the first of a WRN fragment, has been solved by NMR. DPBD consists of a winged helix-like motif and an unstructured C-terminal region of 20 aa. The putative DNA-binding surface of DPBD has been identified by using known structural and biochemical data. Based on the structural data and on the biochemical data, we suggest a surface on the DPBD for interacting with other proteins. In this structural model, a single winged helix domain binds to both DNA and other proteins. Furthermore, we propose that DPBD functions as a regulatory domain to regulate the enzymatic activity of WRN and to direct cellular localization of WRN through protein­protein interaction.

uman genetic diseases that resemble accelerated aging provide useful models for understanding the aging process on both cellular and molecular levels. Werner syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that mimics premature human aging (1). WS patients age rapidly after puberty, with the accelerated development of atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, graying and loss of hair, type II diabetes, bilateral cataracts, osteoporosis, and thymic atrophy (1). These individuals are predisposed to the emergence of benign and malignant neoplasm (1). The most common causes of death for WS patients are cancers, with an average age of death of 47 years. In addition, WS cells exhibit genomic instability, replication defects, and aberrant telomere maintenance (2, 3). The WS gene (WRN) encodes a WRN protein (Fig. 1) (4), which is a member of the RecQ helicase family. In humans, five RecQ helicases, RECQ1, Bloom syndrome protein (BLM), WRN, RECQ4, and RECQ5, have been identified. Defects in the BLM, WRN, and RECQ4 genes have been linked to Bloom syndrome, WS, and Rothmund­Thomson syndrome, respectively. WRN also contains four other domains (Fig. 1): a nuclease, a RecQ carboxy (RQC), a helicase-and-ribonuclease D-C-terminal (HRDC), and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain (4­6). Recent studies support that WRN is involved in DNA replication, repair, recombination, and telomere maintenance (5). However, the molecular pathways in which WRN is involved in vivo remain elusive.

Most mutations identified in WS patients result in C-terminal truncated WRN proteins missing NLS (4). The inability of WRN to be transported into the nucleus seems to be crucial for the pathogenesis of WS. Inside the nucleus, WRN is located mainly in the nucleoli and in nuclear foci. The specific regions of WRN that are responsible for this localization have been mapped to a 144-residue fragment (amino acids 949-1092) and a NLS-containing C-terminal fragment (7). Interestingly, this 144-residue motif has been shown to be a multifunctional DNA- and protein-binding domain (DPBD), which is the major site of WRN for interacting with the structure-specific DNA and with a number of functional proteins (8). The structure-specific DNA substrates include fork, flap, bubble, G4 tetraplex, D-loop, and Holliday junction DNA (9). There are 14 reported WRN­protein interactions, which result in functional consequences in either WRN or its interactive protein, and each of these interactions requires the DPBD of WRN or a part of the DPBD (5, 8). The WRN-interacting proteins include FEN-1, EXO-1, PARP-1, TRF1, TRF2, BLM, p53, and RAD52 (5, 8). In addition, five nonsense or frame-shift mutations of WRN (4, 10, 11) have been mapped to the DPBD, and four of the resulting mutants are aligned with the WT DPBD as shown in Fig. 1. Taken together, DPBD plays an important role in the function of WRN. Either the RQC domain is absent from some family members or its amino acid sequence has diverged significantly enough to make its identification difficult. Consequently, some literature limits the RQC domain to the more conserved N-terminal region (Fig. 7, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), the putative Zn-binding domain. Recently, the Zn-binding domain has been confirmed in the Escherichia coli RecQ (12, 13) and BLM (14). The RQC domain of the E. coli RecQ comprises a Zn finger and a winged helix (WH) motif (13). The putative DNA-binding residues of the WH domain of the E. coli RecQ were postulated (13). However, these residues appear to be nonconserved in the RecQ helicase family. Moreover, none of these residues has been confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, it is unknown that the WH domain of the E. coli RecQ is involved in any protein­protein interaction. Based on biochemical mapping experiments, Bohr and coworkers (8) proposed that the DPBD of WRN might also contain a WH domain that binds both DNA and a number of proteins. However, the WH domains are not known to bind to both DNA and other non-WH domains. Sequence alignments of DPBD with the E. coli and other human RecQ proteins could not identify any significant

The purification procedure yielded 2­6 mg of labeled protein from 1 liter of culture with purity of 95% (Fig. 9, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The NMR samples used were 0.35 mM labeled protein dissolved in 25 mM KPi (pH 7.4), 25 mM NaCl, 4 mM d10-DTT, 1 mM d16-EDTA, and 92.5% H2O 7.5% D2O.

sequence homology (Fig. 8, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The pairwise sequence alignments of the DPBD with the WH domain of the E. coli RecQ show a slightly higher ( 17%) sequence identity. It is well established that the proteins at this level of sequence identity do not necessarily have a similar structure (15). Moreover, the E. coli RecQ and WRN are two different proteins with different functions. The pronounced functional diversity of the RQC domains in the RecQ family implies significantly structural differences in the DNA- and protein-binding surfaces. To understand the structural basis of DPBD in the WRN function, we have determined the solution structure of the DPBD by NMR. Interestingly, the structure reveals a WH-like domain, which is structurally similar to the WH domains found in the E. coli RecQ (13) and a number of DNA-binding proteins (16), in the N terminus and a disordered region of 20 residues in the C terminus of the DPBD. The structure-based sequence alignments of DPBD with several WH domains with known protein­dsDNA cocrystal structures identify a putative DNA-recognition helix in the DPBD. Remarkably, K1016 of the putative DNA-recognition helix has recently been shown to interact with DNA by the site-directed mutagenesis (17). This is the first fragment of the RecQ family helicase whose 3D structure is known and whose DNA-binding residue, although only one, has been identified biochemically. Furthermore, a protein-binding surface of the DPBD has also been postulated based on the known biochemical and structural data. Based on these results, we propose that DPBD functions as a regulatory domain that mediates protein­protein interactions to regulate the enzymatic activity of WRN and to direct cellular localization of WRN. Methods
Expression, Purification, and Sample Preparation. The KpnI and

a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with a z-shielded gradient triple-resonance cryoprobe. Data were processed with the NMRPIPE package (18) and analyzed by using PIPP (19). The sequential backbone assignments of DPBD were made by using triple-resonance methodology (20) as reported in ref. 21. Briefly, the 2D HNCG arom and HN(CO)CG arom were used to identify 1HN­15N resonances of aromatic residues and following residues (22), which were used as starting points for sequential backbone resonance assignments when combined with HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCA, and HN(CO)CA. HNCO, HNHA, and HNCOCO (23) experiments were performed to obtain 1H and 13C resonance assignments and to simultaneously obtain constraints. 1H and 1H resonances for some residues were obtained by using HBHA(CO)NH. Other side-chain resonance assignments were made by using DIPSI-C(CCO)NH, DIPSI-H(CCO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, and HCCH-COSY (21). The HCCH-COSY experiment optimized for CH3 detection was used to confirm assignments for CH3-containing residues, and the HBHA(CO)NH and CBCA(CO)NH experiments optimized for NH2 detection were used to validate assignments for NH2-containing residues. 2D edited 1H-13C HSQC experiments (24) were used to confirm assignments for aromatic and carbonyl-containing residues. Backbone torsion angle constraints were derived from backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shifts by using the program TALOS (25). The predicted angles were further evaluated by using the combination of 3JHNH and 3JC C (23). The 2D HNCG arom, HN(CO)CG arom, and HNCG were used to determine intraresidue 3JNC and 3JC C (22, 26). Other 3J couplings involved in a methyl group were measured by using quantitative J correlation experiments (27). The measured coupling constants were used to derive torsion angle constraints. Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) were measured from 3D 15N-edited NOESY (20), and sensitivity and resolution improved 3D, 4D 13C-edited, and 4D 15N 13C- edited NOESY experiments (J.-S.H., unpublished observations).
Structure Calculations. Approximate interproton distance constraints, derived from NOESY spectra, were grouped into four distance ranges, 1.8­2.7, 1.8­3.3, 1.8­5.0, and 1.8­6.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs, respectively. We added 0.5 Å to the upper bound for distances involving methyl groups to account for the higher apparent intensity of the methyl resonances, and we added 0.2 Å to the upper bounds for NOE constraints involving amide protons. Distances involving nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons, methyl, and H and H protons of Tyr and Phe were represented as a ( r 6) 1/6 sum (28). The torsion angle constraints are represented by squarewell potentials. The structures were calculated by simulated annealing in torsion angle space (29) by using the program X-PLORNIH (30). Structure figures were generated by using the program MOLMOL (31). The coordinates of the ensemble of 10 simulated annealing structures, the constrained regularized mean structure, and the complete list of experimental NMR constraints have been deposited in the RCSB database (access code 2AXL).

XhoI fragment containing the 144-residue DPBD (residues 9491092) of human WRN was subcloned into pET32d, the mutant pET32a (Novagen), in which the GGTATG sequence right after the thrombin site was mutated to introduce a KpnI site. These plasmids, pET32d­DPBD, were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21 (Novagen). Uniform 15N and 13C labeling was obtained by growing the cells in M9 minimal medium containing either 15NH4Cl and or [13C6]-D-glucose, respectively. The thiorodoxin-His-6tagged DPBD fusion protein was purified by a HiTrap-Sepharose

the expression systems tested, an N-terminal thioredoxin fusion plasmid with a T7 promoter and a His-6 sequence, a pET32a mutant, yielded the highest level of protein expression in the soluble fraction. The thioredoxin fusion protein was purified by using Zn-chelating, instead of Ni-chelating, affinity chromatography, because the latter method produced complicated products that made further purification very difficult. The fusion protein tends to be unstable in the absence of 0.5 M NaCl. To minimize protein precipitation, spin columns instead of dialysis were used to quickly remove high salt from the fusion protein before subjection to thrombin digestion. Temperature, time, and thrombin concentration were optimized to achieve maximized fusion protein digest and to minimize additional digestion and degradation of both fusion protein and the resulting DPBD protein. DPBD tends to aggregate even at a concentration as low as 0.35 mM. The problem of instability was partially alleviated by increasing pH and salt concentration. After extensive optimization, an average 1HN transverse relaxation time of 12 ms was obtained at 600 MHz and 22°C when the 0.35 mM protein was dissolved in 25 mM KPi (pH 7.4) and 25 mM NaCl. The result indicates that the protein behaves like a protein of 35­40 kDa (32). However, the protein appears to aggregate nonspecifically because no characteristic NOE patterns for a homodimer could be observed. To overcome the problem associated with the larger molecular mass and resonance overlaps, some improvements have been made when using the established multidimensional NMR experiments (20). Briefly, the more sensitive and simplified 2D spin-echo difference experiments, HNCG arom and HN(CO)CG arom, were used not only to identify 1HN­15N resonances of aromatic residues and following residues but also to provide 1 angle constraints for all aromatic residues (22, 33). These 1HN­15N resonances of aromatic residues and of following residues were used as starting and check points for sequential backbone resonance assignments when combined with HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCA. This strategy takes advantage of 22 aromatic residues in the protein and has proved to be very useful because HNCACB offers very limited assignment information for the protein in the protonated form with extensively overlapped 1HN­15N resonances. The side-chain resonance assignment presents another significant challenge, because the combination of HBHA(CO)NH, DIPIS-H(CCO)NH, DIPSIC(CCO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, and HCCH-COSY offered only a few unambiguous and complete assignments. Therefore, the HCCH-COSY experiment optimized for methyl detection was used to achieve assignments for methyl-containing residues, and HBHA(CO)NH and CBCA(CO)NH optimized for NH2 detection were used to make assignments for NH2-containing residues. In addition, 15N-separated NOESY was used extensively to make and validate side-chain resonance assignments. The resolution- and sensitivity-improved 3D, 4D 13C-separated, and 4D 15N 13Cseparated NOESY (J.-S.H., unpublished observations) experiments were designed to partially overcome the problem associated with short 1HN transverse relaxation time on the 13C spins to extract NOE constraints. Essentially complete assignments for the backbone and side-chain resonances were obtained for all 144 residues (21). The secondary structure is summarized in Fig. 1. We used a structure-based approach to assign 1,552 NOEs in a stepwise process. The structure was calculated on the basis of 2,336 experimental NMR constraints. A summary of the structural statistics is provided in Table 1, and a superposition of the final ensemble of 10 simulated annealing structures is shown in Fig. 2. Excluding residues 949­954 in the N terminus and residues 1069­ 1092, the structures align well (Fig. 2), with backbone and nonhydrogen atom rms deviations (rmsds) of 0.69 0.12 Å and 1.05 0.16 Å, respectively, relative to the average structure, and they have good covalent geometry and small energy terms as defined by X-PLOR-NIH (Table 1). PROCHECK (34) revealed 85.4%, 8.1%, and 2.4% of the protein residues in the most favored, additionally

DPBD of WRN Contains a WH-Like Domain. The core of DPBD is

approximately globular in shape, with approximate overall dimensions of 22 16 16 Å3 (corresponding to the width, height, and depth of the molecule), and is composed of five -helices and four -strands (Figs. 1 and 3). Helices 1 and 4 are approximately perpendicular to each other (interhelical angle 85°); helix 2 is oriented at an angle of 110°, 70°, and 80° to helices 3, 4, and 5, respectively; helix 3 is oriented at 45° and 45° to helices 4 and 5, respectively; and the angle between helices 4 and 5 is 150°. The core is tightly packed and is composed principally of hydrophobic residues. It appears that the -sheet formed by 1 and 4 is not important for the protein folding, because the removal of the entire C terminus including 4 does not destroy the fold of the protein core (data not shown). The C-terminal 24 residues are largely unstructured (Fig. 2). The unstructured C terminus contains two cysteine residues, C1070 and C1090, which most likely contribute to the oligomerization of the protein. More than one oligomeric state of the protein caused by oxidation of these cysteine residues has been observed by chromatography and NMR (data not shown). However, removal of the last three residues, including C1090, decreases the protein expression in E. coli significantly, and removal of the C-terminal 32 residues, including both C1070 and C1090, does not completely eliminate aggregation of the protein (data not shown). Therefore, NMR studies were carried out with the 144residue DPBD protein, because most functional studies were carried out with a fusion protein containing the entire DPBD motif (8). The significance of the unstructured C terminus in the DPBD in the DNA and protein binding remains to be determined. We then used the DALI program (35) to perform the structurebased sequence alignments using the determined structure of

The force constants for different terms in the target function used for the simulated annealing are the same as described in ref. 45. *None of the structures exhibit distance violations 0.7 Å or dihedral angle violations 7°.  SA is the ensemble of the final 10 simulated annealing structures. The means structure SA was obtained by averaging the coordinates of the individual structures best fitted to each other by using residues 955­1068. The coordinate precision is defined as the average atomic rmsd between the individual simulated annealing structures and the mean coordinates SA. Values are reported for residues 955­1068.

DPBD. The results show that the DPBD of WRN and the WH domain of the E. coli RecQ are structurally homologous, with a similarity Z-score of 8.7 and best-fit superposition of 110 C atoms of a rmsd of 2.4 Å (Figs. 3 and 4). The sequence identity of the two fragments increases to 25% for 110 residues after the structurebased sequence alignment, compared with that of 17% sequence based on the initial amino acid sequence alignment. The two proteins have very similar secondary structures. However, significant differences have been observed in the C-terminal half of the proteins. These results are understandable because the C-terminal half of the protein of the DPBD of WRN appears to be involved in

Shown are structure-based sequence alignments of the DPBD with the most structurally homologous WH-containing proteins (RecQ, MarR, and BlaI) and the WH-containing proteins with known protein­DNA cocrystal structures (BlaI, RTP, DtxR, D2P, and CAP). The sequence number for the first residue on each line is indicated on the left. Sequence regions that do not align with the DPBD are not shown.

the interactions with both DNA and proteins, as discussed in the following sections. Therefore, the observed significantly structural differences in the DNA- and protein-binding surfaces between these two WH domains account for the pronounced functional diversity of the RQC domains in the two proteins. The DALI search also shows that the DPBD of WRN is structurally similar to the WH domains found in many DNA-binding proteins (16). The closest structural resemblance is the regulator of multiple antibiotic resistance, MarR (36), and -lactamase repressor, BlaI (37), with Z-scores of 7.0 and 6.5, respectively. The rmsd between DPBD and MarR is 2.1 Å (over 77 equivalent C atoms), and the rmsd between DPBD and BlaI is 2.5 Å (over 78 equivalent C pairs) (Figs. 3 and 4). This finding is consistent with the observation that DPBD is the strongest DNA-binding region, followed by HRDC and nuclease domains of WRN (9). Interestingly, DPBD of WRN prefers structure-specific DNA, as described above, compared with ssDNA or dsDNA (9, 17). However, most WH domains bind to the typical dsDNA (16). The reason for these differences could be answered only if the structure of a DPBD­ DNA complex could be determined.

common variation on the helix­turn­helix motif observed in DNAbinding proteins. Topologically, the WH motif is a compact structure consisting of two wings (W1 and W2), three -helices ( 1, 2, and 3), and three -strands ( 1, 2, and 3) arranged in order 1- 1- 2- 3- 2-W1- 3-W2 (16). BlaI has the greatest structural similarity among DPBD-like proteins with known protein­DNA complex structures (Figs. 3 and 4), followed by replication terminator protein (RTP) from Bacillus subtilis (38), diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) (39), cell-cycle transcription factor (D2P) (40), and the E. coli catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) (41). The WH is characterized by an interhelical recognition that is principally achieved by the third (DNA recognition) helix of the WH. StrucHu et al.

proposed would participate in the DNA­DPBD interaction. However, this issue remains to be addressed at this time because of difficulties in producing the R1020A mutant (17). Additional mutation experiments will help to resolve this issue if those mutants can be purified. The DNA-binding residue K1016 of WRN is not conserved in the RecQ family (Fig. 8). The comparable residue in the E. coli RecQ helicase is V470 (Fig. 4), which is unlikely to be involved in the DNA binding. In fact, none of the putative DNA-binding residues proposed for the DPBD of WRN is conserved in the RecQ helicase family (Fig. 8), with the exception of R1020. These structural differences in the WH domains suggest the pronounced functional diversity of the WH domains in the RecQ family. This finding is consistent with the observed differences in substrate specificity and processivity among the different RecQ helicases (5). The putative DNA-binding surface of the WH domain of the E. coli RecQ helicase was previously proposed based on the comparison with the crystal structure of the E. coli CAP­DNA complex (13). However, the proposed DNA-binding residues appear to be not conserved in the RecQ helicase family. Moreover, there were no biochemical data to back up that model. Therefore, this study provides a structural model with a DNA-binding surface supported by both structural database and biochemical data, although only one residue could be identified so far (17).
DPBD Binds to both DNA and Other Proteins Through a Single WH Domain. DPBD has been shown to bind several proteins involved in

ture-based sequence alignments of DPBD with these DNA-binding WH domains would be helpful in identifying the putative DNArecognition helix of DPBD. By analogy, helix 4 of DPBD constitutes a DNA-recognition helix, which is illustrated in Fig. 5. The Nterminal end of helix 4 readily fits into the major grove, permitting interactions with the DNA involving E1012, S1013, K1016, R1020 of H4, K1039 of W1, E1030 of 2, and E1068 from the C terminus (Fig. 5). K1016 is positioned along the phosphate backbone and makes the primary contact with DNA. R1039 and R1020 can provide supplementary electrostatic interactions with DNA. E1012, S1013, E1030, and E1068 can bind to the DNA through hydrogen bonds. In support of this DNA-binding model, we have found that the K1016A mutation, which retains the structure of the wild-type DPBD, significantly decreases DPBD binding to fork or bubble DNA substrates (17). On the other hand, mutations of the residues K1008 and Q1010, all of which are projected away from the postulated DNA-binding surface, have no effect on DNA binding of DPBD (17). The fact that K1016A mutant significantly decreases, but does not completely abolish, the DNA-binding ability of DPBD suggests that other putative DNA-binding residues as

DNA metabolism (5, 8). DPBD interacts with human FEN-1 and stimulates its endonucleolytic activity (8). DPBD binds to PARP-1 and inhibits the PARP-mediated protein ribosylation (8). The large subunit of human replication protein A (RPA70) stimulates WRN helicase through the interaction with the DPBD motif (8). DPBD interacts with TRF2 and stimulates helicase activity of WRN (8). DPBD also binds to BLM (8). In addition, DPBD is at least partially responsible for the interactions of WRN with EXO-1, p53, and RAD52 (5, 8). However, these proteins are not known to contain WH domains. Thus, DPBD binds both DNA and other proteins through a single WH domain. This finding is somewhat unexpected, because the WH domains are best known for their interactions with dsDNA (16). When the WH domains do participate in a protein­ protein interaction, this interaction is usually limited to either homodimerization (42) or heterodimerization with another WH domain (40). To date, the only known WH-like motif that interacts with other proteins is the C-terminal region of human RPA32 (43), but it is not known to bind to DNA. It is difficult to pinpoint the protein-binding surface(s) of DPBD at present without structural data from the DPBD­protein complexes. It is especially difficult for a protein with such a diverse

Fig. 6. Model for the regulation of the WRN enzyme by DPBD. Only three functional domains, helicase core (HC), putative Zn-binding domain (ZBD), and DPBD, of WRN are shown. The active site of HC is shown. The DPBD has the strongest DNA-binding pocket of WRN, which collaborates with ZBD to form an even stronger DNA-binding site to hold on to the upstream duplex region of a DNA substrate, whereas HC unwinds at the fork junction of the DNA substrate. The DPBD­DNA interaction dictates a specific DNA processing pathway. The protein­protein interaction between DPBD and the regulatory proteins as discussed in the text directs the cellular localization of WRN or regulates the enzymatic activity of HC.

interacting partners. This problem is further complicated by the fact that the DPBD-binding site has not been determined for any of these proteins. Nevertheless, we can still make some predictions based on known structural and biochemical data. First, the DNAbinding surface is unlikely to be involved in the protein­protein interactions. This finding is consistent with our recent biochemical and NMR studies of the K1016A mutant (17). The K1016A mutation appears to affect only the DPBD­DNA interaction, not the DPBD interactions with other proteins such as FEN-1, because the DPBDK1016A mutant binds to FEN-1 as tightly as the WT DPBD and the K1016A mutation does not change the subnuclear localization patterns observed for the WT WRN (17). Second, the helix 5 likely mediates protein­protein interactions. Homodimerization of DNA-binding domains through one or two -helices has been observed in a number of WH domains, including MarR, RTP, and BlaI (36­38). These -helices are usually located on the other side from the DNA-binding surface of the protein and are highly solvent-exposed even in the protein­protein complexes. The solvent-exposed charged and hydrophobic residues in helix 5 of the DPBD structure make it possible to interact with other proteins. Third, the wing facing toward helix 5 could participate in the protein­protein contacts. Furthermore, the wings in a number of WH domains are known to be involved in homodimerization and heterodimerization. Taking all these observation into the consideration, the surface formed by the helix 5, the wing, and one -sheet formed by 2 and 3 is likely involved in the interaction of DPBD with other proteins. Consistent with this proposal, the amide resonances of S1032 and K1036 in the wing and the amide resonance of K1045 in helix5 are not observable, indicating possible conformational flexibility in the postulated protein­protein interaction surface of DPBD in the unbound state.
DPBD May Function as a Regulatory Motif to Regulate Enzymatic Activities of WRN. WRN contains both helicase and nuclease

domains (Fig. 1). The enzymatic activities associated with the two domains are physically separable (5). However, full function and regulation of catalytic activity of WRN require the presence of other regions of the protein. The fact that DPBD binds to both DNA and a number of functional proteins through a single WH domain leads us to propose a new model (Fig. 6). It is widely accepted that the enzymatic activities of the WRN helicase nuclease play a central role in the function of WRN to maintain genomic stability, arguing that the WS-associated mutants are defective enzymes in addition to mislocating inside the cell. Because WRN interacts with many regulatory proteins, we propose that the

enzymatic activities and DNA-binding ability of WRN must be regulated through one or a few regulatory domains by interacting with such proteins. We further propose that the DPBD is a primary candidate for the regulatory role in WRN (Fig. 6). The RQC domain is unique to the RecQ helicase family, suggesting that it is more likely to function as a regulatory motif than as part of the helicase catalytic core, as was previously proposed (13). The fact that the RQC domains lack any significant sequence homology among the family members suggests that the structural and functional differences exist in the RQC domains. DPBD is the strongest, although not the only, DNA-binding site (8, 9). On one hand, the DPBD­DNA interaction dictates which specific DNA processing pathway WRN chooses to follow. On the other hand, the DPBD­protein interaction directs the subcellular localization of WRN and regulates the enzymatic activity of WRN. Several lines of evidence support our model (Fig. 6). Protein kinase A or p97 VCP binds to DPBD and directs WRN to the nucleus (5, 8). TRF2 or RPA stimulates helicase activity of WRN, and RAD52 either enhances or inhibits helicase activity of WRN, depending on the DNA structure (8). The regulation of helicase activity of WRN by these three proteins is achieved through the DPBD­protein interaction. Moreover, BLM and Ku inhibit the nuclease activity of the WRN nuclease domain through DPBD (8). Furthermore, the WRN helicase and nuclease act coordinately to disrupt and to cleave some DNA substrates (5). Other lines of evidence also support the proposal (Fig. 6). The fragment containing the helicase and RQC domains has a helicase activity similar to that of the full-length WRN (44), but the activity decreases when K1016 is replaced with Ala (17). Moreover, when the DPBD is deleted from the fragment, the helicase activity of the fragment decreases dramatically (17). Our model does not eliminate the possibility that other regions of WRN, which are involved in the protein­protein interactions, could function as regulatory motifs for either WRN nuclease or helicase. However, DPBD likely functions as the primary regulatory site for the WRN enzyme (Fig. 6). It is conceivable that a defective DPBD in either DNA or protein binding would lead to a defective WRN enzyme. Loss of WRN enzyme function then leads to a breakdown in the maintenance of genome integrity and consequently to WS.
