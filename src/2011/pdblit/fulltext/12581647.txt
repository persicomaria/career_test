Crystallographic Snapshot of a Productive Glycosylasparaginase­Substrate Complex
Yeming Wang and Hwai-Chen Guo
Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Boston University School of Medicine, 715 Albany Street, Boston, MA 02118-2526, USA Glycosylasparaginase (GA) plays an important role in asparagine-linked glycoprotein degradation. A deficiency in the activity of human GA leads to a lysosomal storage disease named aspartylglycosaminuria. GA belongs to a superfamily of N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases that autoproteolytically generate their mature enzymes from inactive single chain protein precursors. The side-chain of the newly exposed N-terminal residue then acts as a nucleophile during substrate hydrolysis. By taking advantage of mutant enzyme of Flavobacterium meningosepticum GA with reduced enzymatic activity, we have obtained a crystallographic snapshot of a productive complex with its substrate (NAcGlc-Asn), at 2.0 Å resolution. This complex structure provided us an excellent model for the Michaelis complex to examine the specific contacts critical for substrate binding and catalysis. Substrate binding induces a conformational change near the active site of GA. To initiate catalysis, the side-chain of the N-terminal Thr152 is polarized by the free -amino group on the same residue, mediated by the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr170. Cleavage of the amide bond is then accomplished by a nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon of the amide linkage in the substrate, leading to the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate through a negatively charged tetrahedral transition state.

Introduction
Glycosylasparaginase (GA) is a lysosomal amidase involved in the ordered degradation of Asnlinked glycoproteins.1 It belongs to a superfamily of enzymes called N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases, that catalytically use a processed N-terminal threonine, serine, or cysteine as both a polarizing base and a nucleophile to act on a variety of substrates.2 Several crystal structures of mature Ntn enzymes have been reported, including glutamine 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase,3,4 proteasome -subunits,5­7 penicillin acylases,8­11 glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase,12

The polar side-chain of this N-terminal residue is thought to act as a nucleophile during substrate hydrolysis. However, no histidine or other basic amino acid is present in the active sites of these enzymes, suggesting a unique class of amide hydrolyzing enzymes exists that is different from the four previously described classical proteinase families,23 among which the serine and cysteine proteases, whose hydroxyl or thiol groups serve as the active-site nucleophile, and the metalloproteases and acidic proteases, where the critical nucleophile is a bound water molecule. A distinctive mechanism has been proposed for the catalytic reaction of the Ntn hydrolase family: the free -amino group on the N-terminal threonine, serine, or cysteine acts as the base required to enhance the nucleophilicity of its own side-chain nucleophile.2,5,8 This intra-residue

83 addition, the interactions between the enzyme and the oligosaccharide part of the ligand remains to be seen. It is conceivable that solvent molecules or ions might be involved in the catalysis, and in the polarization of the nucelophile by the -amino group of the N-terminal threonine. Furthermore, the detailed mechanism of the intra-residue basenucleophile interactions has been controversial. Recently, based on hydrogen-bonding patterns in the crystal structure of isoaspartyl aminopeptidase­ product complex, some concerns have been raised to question the intra-residue base-nucleophile polarization through a direct hydrogen bond.16 To address these issues, we have determined high-resolution crystal structures of a productive GA­substrate complex. Based on the current studies, a modified model of intra-residue base-nucleophile catalysis is proposed.

base on the threonine or serine replaces the well characterized histidine base in the hydrogenbonded triad that is present in the active-site of many serine proteases.24 From bacteria to eukaryotes, GAs are conserved in amino acid sequences, tertiary structures, and activation of amidase activity by intramolecular autoproteolysis.25,26 To generate the catalytically critical N-terminal nucleophile, Flavobacterium meningosepticum GA undergoes a process of intramolecular autoproteolysis from a single chain precursor to a mature/active enzyme with a 17 kDa  and a 15 kDa -subunit, and exposes the active site threonine at the newly generated Nterminal end of the -subunit to process Asnlinked glycoproteins. Structural and biochemical studies indicate that this autoproteolysis is driven by conformational constraints at the scissile peptide bond.27­29 Enabled by autoproteolysis, GA cleaves the -Naspartylglucosylamine bond that connects the carbohydrate chain to asparagine side-chains of proteins and is thus essential for metabolic turnover of Asn-linked glycoproteins.30,31 It can effectively hydrolyze a variety of glycoasparagines that contain 4 L-asparagine, including its natural substrate N -(N-acetylglucosaminyl)-L-asparagine (NAcGlc-Asn) (Figure 1). This enzyme requires both free -amino and -carboxyl groups on the asparagine, and that the 6 position of N-acetylglucosamine be free of fucose.32 These requirements on substrates lead to hydrolysis of the aspartylglucosylamine bonds after complete release of the glycosylated asparagine from the polypeptide chain and the removal of inner fucose. 33 The lack of GA activity causes accumulation of unprocessed metabolite glycoasparagines (mainly aspartylglucosamine) in the lysosomes of all cell types, and thus results in the lysosomal storage disease aspartylglycosaminuria (AGU).34­37 AGU has been reported worldwide, with a high prevalence in the Finnish population due to a founder effect.33,38,39 It has been proposed that GA also utilizes the novel mechanism of intra-residue base-nucleophile for hydrolyzing the amide bond of glycoasparagines. Nonetheless, several key questions remain to be addressed about the detailed mechanism of GA hydrolysis. Substitution of serine for the catalytic threonine dramatically reduces hydrolase activity,40,41 suggesting that precise positioning of the hydroxyl group in the Michaelis (enzyme­ substrate) complex is critical for GA catalysis. In

Results and Discussion
Cryo-crystallographic approach to stabilize the enzyme­substrate complex To visualize the structure of a pre-catalysis Michaelis (hydrolase­substrate) complex, one would need to prepare complex crystal with a hydrolyzable substrate but trap/stabilize it in the intact form during the entire course of diffraction data collection. This used to be done by using polychromatic or Laue X-rays generated by a synchrotron radiation source to look at a reaction intermediate in the sub-millisecond time range.42 During the past decade an alternative strategy has emerged, by combining rate-reduction (slower but still active mutants) with physical-trapping (cryocrystallography), and thus allowing diffraction data collection with a conventional monochromatic X-ray source.43,44 For such a strategy to work, the reaction rate needs to be reduced to a half-life (t1/2) in a range of minutes-to-hours. With a kcat value of 16s-1 to hydrolyze its natural substrate NAcGlc-Asn in solution,41 the wild-type F. meningosepticum GA is apparently too fast for the cryo-crystallographic approach. Thus, to study the Michaelis complex of GA with its natural substrate we chose a kinetically slower GA mutant, with the nucleophile Thr152 substituted with a cysteine (T152C). This mutant is still capable of autoproteolysis to generate an active hydrolase, which has a catalytic kcat value of

Figure 1. Hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by GA amidase. GA cleaves the -N-aspartylglucosylamine bond (indicated by the bold arrow) of its natural substrate NAcGlc-Asn during proteolytic processings of asparagine-linked glycoproteins, resulting in the release of apartic acid and aminoglycan. The latter product is then further hydrolyzed non-enzymatically to release ammonia and oligosaccharide.

84 1.5 × 10-4 s-1for the natural substrate,41 and thus with an apparent t1/2 value of about 1 h assuming a firstorder reaction. 25,41 We had previously shown that the structure of the T152C mature enzyme is essentially identical to that of the wild-type enzyme, with an r.m.s.d. value of 0.22 Å and 0.25 Å for all the main-chain atoms and active site atoms, respectively.20,28 Thus, the T152C mutant enzyme is suitable for a cryo-crystallographic snapshot of GA catalysis. To prepare productive enzyme­substrate complexes, we start with growing unliganded crystals of the T152C mutant enzyme in its mature form, which crystallizes under the same condition with the same crystal form as the wild-type protein.45 Crystals were then soaked in various concentrations of substrate for different lengths of time at low temperature (4 °C), and complexes were then stabilized in the crystal by cryo-crystallography techniques for data collection. We have collected many diffraction data sets from crystals treated with various combinations of soaking time and substrate concentrations to increase substrate occupancy, but without ligand conversion into reaction intermediate and/or products. We found the optimal crystal preparation to capture a relatively homogeneous enzyme­substrate complexes is by soaking the preformed T152C crystals in a modified well solution containing 30 mM substrate NAcGlc-Asn solution for 3 min followed by flash-cooling at 100 K. Any other combinations of treatments, even though some better resolved diffraction data, resulted in either lower substrate occupancy or ambiguous electron density at the catalytic site, presumably due to an electron density averaged from a mixture of intact substrate, reaction intermediate and products (see below). For example, shortening the soaking time resulted in a dramatic reduction of the occupancies of the substrate at both sites, whereas soaking the crystals for a longer time led to more substrate hydrolysis and thus more complicated images at the substrate sites. From the optimally treated complex crystal, there is clear electron density to fit the intact substrate in the catalytic site (Figure 2), indicating an essentially homogeneous population of substrate

with substantial occupancy. Crystallographic statistics for this data collection and processing as well as model refinement are summarized in Table 1. The crystal structure of this GA­substrate complex has been determined at 2.0 Å resolution and refined to an Rfree of 21.5% and Rcryst of 17.0%. Overview of the GA­substrate complex structure In the asymmetric unit of the crystal, GA forms a homodimer with the two catalytic sites facing away from the dimer interface. These two crystallographically unique sites were designated as site A and B with the nucleophile Cys152 and Cys452, respectively. We have also previously shown that GA exists as a homodimer in solution.28 Between the two GA complexes in the crystal, the overall structures of GA are essentially identical, with an r.m.s.d. value of 0.15 Å for all the main-chain atoms. The GA structures in the complexes are also very similar to the structures of the unliganded enzyme,20 with an r.m.s.d. value of 0.29 Å for all the main-chain atoms. For each enzyme complex, the  and -subunits of GA together form a four-layer -sandwich structure, like other N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases. All inter-layer loops cluster at one side of the structure, on the surface far from the dimer interface (Figure 3(a)). These loops provide functional groups for the active site, including the side-chains of residues Trp11, Ser50, Cys152, Arg180, Asp183 and Ser184, which are highly conserved throughout GA of all species. In addition, residues Thr170 from the strand bS2, Thr203 and Gly204 from the strand bS4, and Gly206 from the helix bH1 (Figure 3(b)) have also been proposed to participate in catalysis.20 A Michaelis (enzyme­substrate) complex In the catalytic site of one complex (site A), the electron density map clearly shows the presence of predominantly uncleaved substrate molecule NAcGlc-Asn (Figure 2). The occupancy of the substrate was estimated to be 80% based on the

85 tion of substrate and acyl-enzyme intermediate was attempted (Supplementary Data, Figure 6(b)), but the maps at this resolution could not model this with confidence. Nonetheless, the electron density does suggest that significant amount of substrate at the sites B inside the crystal has been converted into other species, likely the reaction intermediates and/ or products. This observation lends further support for the appropriateness of using the T152C mutant enzyme to study a productive enzyme­substrate complex. Atomic interactions between GA and substrate The Michaelis complex structure at site A shows that the key residues involved in substrate-binding are conserved residues Trp11, Ser50, Cys152 (or Thr152 in the wild-type enzyme), Arg180, Asp183, Thr203, Gly204 and Gly206. The interactions involve mainly several hydrogen-bonding interactions, two salt bridges, and multiple van der Waals contacts (Figure 4). Upon binding, the L-asparagine part of the substrate is placed into a narrow pocket which is formed by the side-chains of residues Cys152, Thr170, Arg180, Asp183, Ser184, Thr203 and the main-chains of residues Gly204 and Gly206 (Figures 3(b) and 4). The negatively charged carboxyl group of the substrate forms a salt bridge with the positively charged side-chain of Arg180. The -carboxyl group of the substrate can also form two hydrogen bonds with the side-chain of Arg180, and another one with the main-chain nitrogen atom of Gly206. The free -amino group of the substrate is hydrogen-bonded to the mainchain carbonyl oxygen of Gly204, and it also interacts with the side-chain of Asp183 through a salt bridge. These interactions are consistent with the requirement of free -amino and -carboxyl groups on the asparagine substrate.32 Residues Arg180, Asp183 and Gly206 are located far away from the scissile bond, and thus they are unlikely to be involved directly in the catalysis. Instead, they could serve as a docking device for the substrate binding and help maintain the conformation of the substrate molecule for better interactions with other active site residues. Mutagenesis of either Arg180 or Asp183 affected both the KM and kcat values, and the enzyme specificity was reduced by 200 to 106-fold.41 On the other end of the substrate, the oligosaccharide part is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds and various van der Waals contacts formed between GA and the substrate (Figure 4). The free -amino group of Cys152 interacts with the oxygen atom at the 5 position of the substrate. In addition, the hydroxyl group at the 6 position of the substrate is located right between the side-chains of residues Trp11 and Ser50, and forms a hydrogen bond to the side-chain hydroxyl group of the latter (Figure 4), in line with the requirement that the 6 position of the glycan part be free of fucose. The aromatic sidechain of Trp11 was generally believed to play a role in carbohydrate-binding,46 involving mainly van

electron density maps. The refined B factors for the substrate (average 28.7 Å2) are close to those for protein side-chain atoms (21.0 Å2). In this model, 20% of the GA active sites A remain empty. Interestingly, for residues Thr203 and Gly204 that form the catalytic site, two alternative conformations were observed with estimated occupancy of 80% versus 20%. The minor conformation looks very similar to the "open" conformation of the unliganded GA structure,20 with an r.m.s.d. value for all the active site atoms of 0.28 Å, indicating an essentially identical conformation. On the other hand, the major conformation appears to adopt the "closed" conformation observed in the GA­product complex.19 In the catalytic site of the second complex (site B), a bifurcated density with a well-defined -carboxylate end interacting with Arg180 (Supplementary Data, Figure 6(a)) appears to derive from a mixture of aspartylated­enzyme intermediate and the uncleaved substrate, both have their carboxylate groups.

87 Active site residues and comparisons with other Ntn hydrolases The structure of the productive T152C GA­ substrate complex has enabled us to analyze the catalytic roles of active site residues (Figure 4). To this end, we have modeled into the complex structure the active gauche(+) conformation for the thiol group, aided by the previously determined structure of the wild-type enzyme. In addition to the N-terminal nucleophile, conserved residues across species at the catalytic site have been proposed to play various roles during catalysis.20 We have now provided the structural basis to analyze their catalytic roles in detail: In its active rotamer conformation, the nucleophilic thiol group of Cys152, 3.2 Å away from the targeted carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate, is stabilized by hydrogen-bond interactions with the side-chain hydroxyl groups of Thr170 and Ser184 (Figure 4). The line connecting the thiol group of Cys152 and the targeted carbon is almost perpendicular to the targeted carbonyl plane of the substrate, which is the optimal orientation for orbital overlap of the nucleophile and the targeted carbonyl carbon atom.47 In addition, the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr170 also forms a hydrogen bond with the free -amino group of Cys152 (Figure 4). This -amino group is believed to act as the base during the catalysis process. 2,19,20 Thus, the side-chain of Thr170 appears to be involved in the polarization of the nucelophile of the Cys152 side-chain by the free -amino group, by bridging the -amino group and the side-chain nucleophile on the same Nterminal residue. For Ser184, structural equivalent was also found in other Ntn hydrolases: Ser211 in isoaspartyl peptidase16 and Thr225 in plant asparaginase.18 The hydroxyl groups of these side-chains could thus play a similar role in stabilizing the catalytic nucleophiles. In the closed conformation, the side-chain hydroxyl oxygen of Thr203 is hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain carbonyl oxygen of the substrate (Figure 4). However, this interaction does not appear to be critical for substrate binding, since replacement of Thr203 with either cysteine or alanine does not affect the KM values substantially.41 Instead, it is likely that this interaction plays some role in stabilizing the negatively charged tetrahedral transition-state and thus is part of the so-called oxyanion hole.19,20 However, mutation of Thr203 to Ala203 reduced the kcat value by only tenfold,41 suggesting that there is another component of the oxyanion hole. The distance from the main-chain nitrogen atom of Gly204 to the side-chain carbonyl oxygen of the substrate is 3.2 Å (Figure 4), although the angular geometry is not optimal for them to form a hydrogen bond. However, during the negatively charged tetrahedral transition-state, the carbonyl carbon of the substrate becomes sp3-hybridized, which would rotate the C­O1 bond clockwise around the C­C bond to adopt a slightly different orientation from that observed in the uncleaved substrate (Figure 4).

pocket and interacts with the active site residues. The majority of the glycan part extends outward into the bulk solvent (Figures 3(b) and 4). This may explain why GA allows variations in the oligosaccharide part of its substrate. Conformational movements upon binding of substrate Substrate binding induces small but significant shifts of a few secondary structural elements around the active site. Previously we reported that the active site of the unliganded enzyme adopts an open conformation.20 As a result of substrate binding, a closed conformation of the active site is adopted to grasp the substrate molecule (Figure 3(b)), similar to the conformation of a GA­product complex.19 This conformational change involves mainly residues 203­204 from bS4 as well as residues 237­256 from bH3, bH4, bS5 and the loops between them. The r.m. s.d. for main-chain atoms of these shifted secondary structural elements is 0.64 Å, whereas the deviation for all other residues is 0.23 Å. These movements are all toward the active site for binding substrate, with the C atom of residue Thr203 moving by 0.8 Å. Furthermore, the occupancy of the closed GA conformation approximates that of the intact substrate molecule, consistent with the notion that about 80% of this active site is substrate-occupied, while the other 20% is empty. The distance between the C atom of the nucleophile Cys152 and the hydroxyl oxygen of Thr203, involved in the oxyanion hole (see below), is 6.5 Å in the open conformation versus 4.3 Å in the closed conformation. Therefore, the side-chain hydroxyl oxygen of Thr203 moves closer to the side-chain of Cys152 by 2.2 Å. After substrate binding, the side-chain of cysteine 152 in the T152C mutant does not immediately assume the rotamer conformer required for catalysis (Figure 2). Instead, it remains as the inactive conformation observed in the unliganded enzyme structure of the same mutant, with a trans position.20 In the wild-type enzyme structure, this trans position of the threonine side-chain is taken by the methyl group, and the hydroxyl group takes the gauche(+) conformation that is suitable to initiate a nucleophilic attack at the substrate.20 The calculated (averaged) electron density at the catalytic site A of the T152C mutant clearly indicates that the inactive trans- rotamer conformation is the predominant conformation (Figure 2), suggesting that the active gauche(+) conformation only exists transiently for the T152C mutant. However, to form the acyl-enzyme intermediate (Supplementary Data, Figure 6), the thiol group would need to rotate into a productive position similar to that of wild-type nucleophilic hydroxyl group of Thr152.20 Such a requirement of side-chain switch to activate the hydrolase activity was also found in another Ntn hydrolase, the glutaminase domain of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase, in which a cysteine is the wild-type nucleophile.12

88 This geometric adjustment could allow the mainchain nitrogen atom of Gly204 to interact and stabilize the oxyanion group of the tetrahedral transition-state. Collapse of this tetrahedral intermediate leads to breakage of the covalent -Naspartylglucosylamine bond, release of the oligosaccharide part of the substrate, and formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. This decomposition process is likely facilitated by a neighboring water molecule. A candidate water molecule is identified at the active site A (Figure 4), which is hydrogenbonded to the amino group at the 1 position of the substrate and located 4.4 Å away from the base during the initial substrate-binding, but conformational change at the active site during formation of the tetrahedral intermediate could bring this water molecule closer to the base for action. The aromatic side-chain of Trp11 plays important roles both in binding to the glycan part of the substrate and in catalysis. When Trp11 was mutated to Ser11, the kcat value for the natural substrate was reduced remarkably (500-fold).41 This large reduction cannot be explained by loss of the hydrogenbonding interaction between the side-chains of Trp11 and Thr203, because mutagenesis of Thr203 did not reduce the kcat value substantially. Instead, it appears that the interactions between the aromatic side-chain of Trp11 and the oligosaccharide part of the substrate not only facilitate substrate binding, but also maintain an optimal conformation of the substrate for catalysis. With the substrate properly bound, the nucleophilic S atom of Cys152 (in its active conformation) points at the targeted carbonyl carbon of the substrate at a direction that is perpendicular to the carbonyl plane of the substrate, with a distance of 3.2 Å, suitable for a nucleophilic attack (Figure 4). If Trp11 is mutated to Ser11, loss of the van der Waals contacts and the stacking interactions between the side-chain of Trp11 and the glycan part of the substrate may lead to a conformational change of the substrate. This conformational change, although small, may result in large reduction in the catalysis. A well-characterized example is isocitrate dehydrogenase, for which small conformational changes of the substrate have been shown to alter the reaction rates remarkably.47 On the other hand, a substitution of Trp11 with a phenylalanine results in an inactive enzyme, due to the failure of autoproteolysis for enzyme activation.27,41 Structural comparisons with enzyme­ligand complexes of other Ntn hydrolases have provided hints about their differences in substrate specificity. In isoaspartyl aminopeptidase, an insertion of over 20 amino acid residues fill out the space into which the carbohydrate moiety of GA substrate would bind and interact with the Trp11 of GA.16 As a result, these inserted residues reduce the size and hydrophobicity of the catalytic site in isoaspartyl aminopeptidase, and may explain why it cannot hydrolyze glycosylated asparagine substrates, in contrast to the function of GA. The substrate specificity differences between GA and Taspase1 are even

more dramatic. GA requires a free -carboxylate end on the substrates and act as an amidase to cleave the carbohydrate moiety off the asparagine side-chain. Taspase1, however, acts as an endopeptidase to cleave the peptide bond C-terminal to an aspartate residue.48 Structural comparisons reveal that the catalytic site of Taspases1 is larger due to a different side-chain conformation of Arg262, 17 which is equivalent to the GA residue Arg180 involved in anchoring the free -carboxylate group of substrate. This pocket enlargement appears to allow Taspase1 to bind the substrate in a different mode, by anchoring the -carboxylate group of an aspartate side-chain to Arg262. Thus, the side-chain conformational difference of Arg262 may contribute to the endopeptidase function of Taspase1, in contrast to the amidase function of GA. Catalytic mechanism of GA hydrolase To analyze the catalytic mechanism of the native GA, we modeled the wild-type Michaelis complex based on the T152C GA­substrate complex structure. To this end, we built in a threonine side-chain to replace the Cys152 in the complex, aided by the side-chain conformation previously determined for the wild-type enzyme,20 followed by a 20-cycle overall energy minimization.49 In this model, the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of Thr152, stabilized by the side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser184, aims at the targeted carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate with a distance of 3.0 Å (Figure 5). In general, the catalytic mechanism of GA is similar to classic serine proteases and thus utilizes a cycle of enzymatic acylation and deacylation.20,41 Thus, during GA catalysis, the key elements involved are the nucleophiles, the oxyanion hole and the base. The main difference between GA and serine proteases is the general base. Here, based on the productive GA­ substrate structure, we analyze the detailed mechanisms of the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr152 to serve as the nucleophile, and the free -amino group on the same N-terminal residue to act as the base required to enhance the nucleophilicity.20 Although it has been generally accepted that the N-terminal -amino group is a candidate to act as the general base, the detailed mechanism to abstract proton from the nucleophilic side-chain is controversial. Previously two models have been proposed for the mechanism of nucleophilic activation by the free -amino group. One model proposes that a tightly bound water molecule is recruited to mediate the nucleophilic activation in order to avoid unfavorable geometry of the direct intra-residue hydrogen bond.6,8 Another model, based on a structure of penicillin acylase complexed with a substrate analog, proposes a direct proton abstraction through an intra-residue hydrogen bond because of its close proximity and no nearby water molecule available to mediate the proton relays.11 In the present GA­substrate complex, there is no water molecule in the vicinity to mediate the nucleophilic activation. In addition, the free -amino group is

Figure 5. Proposed nucleophilic activation mechanism of GA. The side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr152 serves as the nucleophile, and the free -amino group on the same residue acts as the base. Polarization of the nucleophile by the base to enhance its nucleophilicity is mediated by the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr170. The polarized nucleophile can then attack (indicated by a green straight arrow) the carbonyl carbon of the substrate, leading to electron-pair rearrangements (shown by red curved arrows) and formation of a tetrahedral transition-state. This negatively charged transition-state is stabilized by an oxyanion hole,  consisting of the O atom of Thr203 and the main-chain nitrogen atom of Gly204. Atoms and bonds involved in the nucleophilic activation are shown in red. Hydrogen bonds are indicated by blue dotted lines with the distances (in Å) labeled. The N-acetyl group of the substrate is not shown here for clarity.

unlikely to directly polarize its own side-chain nucleophile due to an unfavorable geometry to form a direct intra-residue hydrogen bond. Instead, we found that in the GA­substrate complex the free -amino group and the side-chain nucelophile are bridged by hydrogen bonds through the side-chain hydroxyl group of the conserved Thr170 with distances of 2.8 Å­3.1 Å (Figure 5). It is conceivable that a dynamic motion during the reaction could modulate this hydrogen-bonding network to an even better geometry for the nucleophilic activation. Thus, it appears that the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr170 mediates the polarization process for activation. Consistent with this model, mutation of Thr170 to Cys does not affect substrate binding significantly, but the kcat values of the mutants T170C and T170A were reduced by more than 700 and 3000fold, respectively.41 In addition, the oxygen atom at the 5 position of the substrate may also play a role in stabilizing the base by formation of a hydrogen bond with the free -amino group (Figure 5). Consistent with this notion, when asparagine was used as the substrate instead of NAcGlc-Asn, the kcat value decreased 13-fold, indicating that the glycan part of the substrate also contributes to catalysis.41 To investigate whether this nucleophilic activation of Thr152 by Thr170-mediated mechanism is also applicable to other Ntn hydrolases, we compared the GA complex structure with that of other Ntn members (complexed with a substrate analog, reaction product, or ion). Specifically we searched, within the asparaginase family (including GAs) of the Ntn superfamily, for active-site residues equivalent to the T152/T170 pair in GA with the same spatial disposition relative to the ligand. The conserved threonine pair was found in other complex structures, including human GA (T183/ T201),19 isoaspartyl peptidase (T179/T197),16 and plant asparaginase (T193/T211),18 as well as human Taspase1 in which the equivalent pair is T234/

S25217 and therefore the functional hydroxyl groups are also conserved. Thus, we propose that, at least for the asparaginase family of the Ntn superfamily, the nucleophilic activation by the N-terminal amino group is mediated through the conserved side-chain hydroxyl group of a threonine or serine. Furthermore, with the substrate bound, this nucleophilic activation network is shielded from exposure to solvent. This might explain how the N-terminal amino group of the GA nucleophilic residue can remain in the unprotonated state, which is necessary for its role as a general base, even in an acidic environment of lysosomes.

Concluding Remarks
Glycosylasparaginase is a well-known lysosomal amidase. The physiological importance of GA was revealed by identification of a human genetic disease, aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU). GA utilizes the free -amino group of the N-terminal residue as the general acid/base to either polarize the nucleophile or depolarize the leaving group throughout the catalysis process. This is consistent with the observation that human GA has an optimum pH range of pH 7­pH 9,50 at which a significant population of the N-terminal -amino group is uncharged and free to act as the base. This has also raised the possibility that GA might have functions outside of lysosomes, for example, involvement in the myelination of the brain neurons.51 Nonetheless, the detailed mechanism of the nucleophilic activation by the -amino group of the N-terminal residue has been controversial. Here, we have described the crystal structure of a productive enzyme­substrate complex to address this issue. Instead of taking microsecond-resolution snapshots of a crystallized macromolecule as it undergoes catalytic turnover, we took advantage of the slow catalytic rate of a

90 T152C mutant enzyme and cryo-crystallography techniques. We found that when we soaked the crystals of the mutant for about 3 min with a high concentration of the substrate, substrate hydrolysis had already occurred at one site of the dimeric complex, although the substrate was mostly intact at the other site. The difference between the two catalytic sites is likely due to differences in microenvironment and substrate diffusion rate inside the crystals. Thus, this complex is capable of hydrolyzing the natural GA substrate and is an excellent system to study GA catalysis. We found that the activation of the nucleophile by the -amino group is mediated through a side-chain hydroxyl group of a conserved threonine, as opposed to the previously suggested activation via a water molecule mediation or via a direct hydrogen bond. Structural comparisons reveal that this conserved pair of hydroxyl groups with the same spatial disposition relative to the ligand also exists in other asparaginases within the Ntn hydrolase superfamily. Thus, the structure of a productive GA­substrate complex presented here not only improves our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of GA, but also sheds new light on the catalytic mechanism of other Ntn enzymes.

Structure of the Michaelis complex of GA (NCS)-related molecules (2­3% of the structure). This partial model was further subject to rigid-body, simulated annealing, grouped and individual temperature factor refinements as well as energy minimization before being used to calculate MR phases in CNS.49 The first map was calculated at 2.1 Å resolution for model building in the program O.54 During refinement, tight NCS restraints were applied, exclusive of residues that were involved in crystal contacts or in nonstructural loops. After a few rounds of model rebuilding and automated refinement, clear electron density was seen for all residues in the final model, as well as a continuous electron density for the substrate molecule at the active site A. The models for the omitted residues were then built into the electron density one by one except residues Cys152, Thr203, Cys452 and Thr503. When the Rfree appeared to reach a minimum, resolution was extended to 2.0 Å. Several rounds of model rebuilding and refinement were performed, and then the NCS restraints were loosened little by little until the Rfree appeared to reach a minimum. Structural geometries were then optimized to reduce Rfree. Water molecules outside of the active sites were added and the structure was subject to another round of simulated annealing, temperature factor refinement, energy minimization, and manual rebuilding. For residue Thr203 of chain B (forms active site A) and residue Thr503 of chain D (forms active site B), two alternative conformations can be identified. Residues Gly202 to Gly204 of chain B and residues Gly502 to Gly504 of chain D were then refined with two conformations to alleviate structural constraints with the occupancy 80% versus 20%, and 75% versus 25%, respectively (Figure 3(b)). The improved difference electron density at the active sites indicated an abundance of the uncleaved substrate molecule NAcGlc-Asn at the active site A (Figure 2) and a superposition of the uncleaved substrate molecule and presumably an enzyme­acyl intermediate at the active site B (supplementary Data, Figure 6). A substrate molecule NAcGlc-Asn was then manually built in at the active site A with an estimate occupancy of 80%. In the final model, there are ten and eight residues missing, due to a lack of electron density, at the C terminus of the  subunit of molecule A (residues 142­ 151) and B (residues 444­451), respectively. The final model quality was evaluated by PROCHECK.55 For residues with alternative conformations, only their major conformations were used in statistics calculations (Table 1). Secondary structure assignment The secondary structure of the refined GA­substrate complex was assigned by using the STRIDE web server56 and compared to that of the unliganded GA structure assigned by the same software. Structural comparisons All superimpositions between different structures were conducted using either LSQKAB from the CCP4 package53 or MOLMOL.57 When the r.m.s.d. values for all the active site atoms were calculated, residues Trp11, Ser50, Cys152, Thr170, Arg180, Asp183, Ser184, Thr203, Gly204 and Gly206 from complex A (chains A/B) or their equivalents from complex B (chains C/D) were superimposed. When the overall r.m.s.d. values were calculated, all the mainchain atoms of the equivalent residues were compared.

Materials and Methods
Crystal preparation Overexpression, purification, and crystallization of autoproteolyzed F. meningosepticum GA protein (T152C mutant) were described.45 Microseeding was routinely used to improve crystal quality. Shortly before data collection, crystals of the T152C mutant were harvested into a modified well solution containing 10% (v/v) glycerol for 3 min, and then harvested into another modified well solution containing 20% glycerol and 30 mM substrate (NAcGlc-Asn) for another 3 min followed by flash-cooling. Data collection and processing Diffraction data were collected from crystals flashcooled at 100K using X-ray source from a Rigaku generator equipped with an R-Axis IV++ detector, then indexed and scaled using the HKL suite,52 and finally converted to structure factors using TRUNCATE from the CCP4 software package.53 The statistics of data collection and processing are shown in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The complex structure was phased by the previously published structure of unliganded GA as the starting model.20 Each asymmetric unit contains two T152C GA complexes. To avoid model bias, a small part of the unliganded GA structure around the active sites was omitted in the initial phase calculations. Based on previous studies, residues Trp11, Cys152, Thr170, Arg180, Asp183, Thr203, and Gly204 are potential active site residues and were omitted in both non-crystallographic symmetry
