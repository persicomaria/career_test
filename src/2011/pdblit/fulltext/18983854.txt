MenD (2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate) synthase belongs to the superfamily of thiamin diphosphate-dependent decarboxylases, which converts isochorismate and 2oxoglutarate to SHCHC, pyruvate, and carbon dioxide. Here, we report the first crystal structure of apo-MenD from Escherichia coli determined in tetragonal crystal form. The subunit displays the typical three-domain structure observed for ThDP-dependent enzymes. Analytical gel filtration shows that EcMenD behaves as a dimer as well as a tetramer. Circular dichroism and isothermal calorimetry results confirm EcMenD dependency on ThDP, which concomitantly helps to stabilize with better configuration. Ó 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Keywords: Menaquinone MenD ThDP Oxoglutarate Decarboxylase Transferase

Introduction Menaquinone (or vitamin K2), a lipid-soluble molecule, plays a vital role in the electron transport chain in prokaryotes as well as being involved in the blood coagulating proteins in mammals [1]. Due to its absence in humans, menaquinone biosynthesis is recognized as an attractive target for the development of antibiotics for pathogenic microbes [2]. Menaquinone is derived from the common branch-point intermediate, chorismate, of the shikimate pathway in bacteria [3]. Eight proteins are involved in the biosynthesis of menaquinone, and have been extensively studied in gram negative Escherichia coli; among them four responsible genes (men BCDE) including MenD coding for menaquinone biosynthetic enzymes are linked at 49 min in the E. coli chromosome encodes a ketoglutarate decarboxylase and prearomatic compound 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC) synthase, respectively [4]. MenD (2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthase; EC 2.5.1.64 or 2.2.1.9), belongs to the superfamily of thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) dependent decarboxylases [2]. This enzyme converts isochorismate and 2-oxoglutarate to SHCHC, pyruvate, and carbon dioxide. ThDP is a prosthetic group derived from vitamin B1, deprotonated at carbon 2 of the thiazolium ring, and this ylide then attacks the carbonyl carbon of 2-oxoglutarate (AKG) during enzymatic decar* Corresponding authors.

boxylation [1]. MenD is the only enzyme known to catalyze the addition of a ThDP intermediate to the b-carbon of a second substrate, a reaction that is similar to the Stetter reaction, which is a 1,4-addition, or conjugate addition, of an aldehyde to a b-unsaturated compound [5]. MenD is basically a dimer in solution with a molecular weight of 1.4­105 Da for the hexahistidine-tagged protein [4]. The protein is absolutely dependent on the presence of ThDP [6] and a divalent metal ion such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity, with the maximum reaction rate observed in the presence of Mn2+ at pH 8.5 in the Tris­HCl buffer. A very low identity (approx. 20­ 30%) found for MenD sequences from different organisms reveals the diverse nature of this enzyme. At the early stages, MenD was assigned as the bifunctional enzyme SHCHC synthase, however, recently it assigned to SEPHCHC (2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate) synthase [7,8]. In this study, we describe the crystal structure of apo EcMenD (E. coli MenD) with supporting biological assay that reveals its affinity towards ThDP, FAD and oxoglutarate, providing further insight into its function and role as a bifunctional enzyme.

Materials and methods Protein expression and purification. The full-length MenD gene (Accession No. NC_000913) was amplified via PCR using the E. coli K-12 genomic DNA as a template. The sequences of the forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers were designed as fol-

lows: 50 -ggaattccatatgtcagtaagcgcatttaacc-30 and 50 -ccgctcgagtca taaatggcttacctgc-30 (The bases in bold and underlined indicate the NdeI and XhoI digestion sites, respectively). DNA was then inserted into the NdeI/XhoI-digested expression vector, pET-28a (Novagen) to produce recombinant EcMenD with a hexahistidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site at the N-terminus. Further, EcMenD was then overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. To accomplish this, the cells were grown at 310 K to an OD600 of 0.6 in a LB medium containing 50 lg mlÀ1 kanamycin. The protein expression was then induced via the addition of 0.7 mM IPTG, after which cell growth was continued at 295 K overnight. The cells were then harvested by 30 min of centrifugation at 4200g at 277 K. Next, the cell pellet was resuspended in an ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.2, 200 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol] and then disrupted using a sonicator (Sonics, USA). The crude cell extract was then centrifuged for 40 min at 12,000 rpm (Hanil Supra 21 K rotor) at 277 K. The recombinant protein in the supernatant fraction was purified via three chromatographic steps. The first step employed the N-terminal histidine tag by His-Trap chromatography (GE Healthcare). Second step, ion-exchange chromatography was conducted using a Q column (GE Healthcare), followed by chromatography on a prepgrade Superdex 200 26/60 (GE Healthcare) column that had previously been equilibrated with buffer A [25 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.2, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT]. The homogeneity of the purified protein was assessed by SDS­PAGE, after which the protein was concentrated to a final concentration of 25 mg mlÀ1 using a Centri-Prep centrifugal filter (Millipore) with buffer A. Crystallization and data-collection. Initial crystallization was conducted at 295 K via 96 well sitting-drop Intelli-plates using the Hydra II Plus One system (Matrix TechnologyTM) with approximately 800 conditions and a ratio of 200 nl of precipitants to 200 nl of protein solution over 70 ll volume of well solution. Crystallization trials were conducted using screening kits obtained from Hampton Research and Emerald BioStructures. After 2­3 days, micro crystals were observed from Emerald BioStructures Wizard III condition No. 15 (1.6 M Na-citrate) and from Hampton Research's Salt RX1 condition No. 21 (1.2 M tri-Na citrate, 0.1 M Bis­Tris propane, pH 7.0). These micro crystals were diffracted poorly to 7 Å and the space group was undecided. These crystallization conditions were further optimized via the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using reservoir solution (0.5­0.6 M tri-Na citrate). Tetragonal shaped crystal (0.4 Â 0.3 Â 0.2 mm) were obtained after one month at 295 K. The crystals of the EcMenD were cryo-protected with 0.8 M tri-Na citrate and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The X-ray diffraction data were collected from the cooled crystal using an ADSC Quantum CCD 270 detector at beam line BL-17A (Photon factory, Japan). The crystal was oscillated by 1.0° per frame over a total range of 100° at a wavelength of 1.0000 Å. X-ray diffraction data to 2.7 Å was collected. The data were integrated and scaled via DENZO and SCALEPACK crystallographic data-reduction routines with HKL-2000 program suite [9]. UV circular dichroism analyses. The EcMenD protein was structurally characterized to see the effect of ThDP, FAD and AKG on secondary structure in terms of ellipticity, as well as thermal stability, using a circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimeter. The experiments were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Japan) equipped with a temperature-controlling unit, using a 0.1 cm path length cell with a 1 nm bandwidth and 4 s response time. The standard far-UV CD spectra were collected at room temperature at a scan speed of 20 nm/min with a 0.1 nm step resolution. Six accumulations taken from 260 to 190 nm were added and averaged, followed by the subtraction of the solvent CD signal. Thermal denaturation was monitored at 222 nm, increasing the temperature by 1 °C/min from 5 to 100 °C using the CD spectrometer, and the data was converted into fraction unfolded. The concentration of EcMenD was 0.2 mg/ml in 25 mM Tris buffer, pH

8.0. The thermal mid point (Tm) was calculated as described previously [10,11]. Isothermal calorimetry (ITC). ITC experiments were performed at 298 K using a high-precision VP-ITC system (Microcal Inc.). Protein and cofactors (ThDP) were dialysed into 25 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.2, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT. The concentrations of the protein (cell) and cofactor (injector) were kept at 30 and 300 lM, respectively. The heat evolved following each 2 ll injection was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The heat arising from the binding reaction was obtained as the difference between the heat of reaction and the corresponding heat of dilution. Analysis of the data was performed using Origin software (Microcal 1998). Structure determination. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP program within CCP4 [12], where a monomer of the holoenzyme E. coli MenD structure (PDB ID: 2JLC) [13] was used as a model, two translated positions were found within the asymmetric unit. Multiple cycles of editing, adjustment of the model-using coot [14], restrained refinement and final refinement were carried out with refmac program within CCP4 [12]. The final models were validated with PROCHECK [15]. Results and discussion Protein purification, crystallization and X-ray diffraction analysis EcMenD (62 kDa) was overexpressed in E. coli in a soluble form with a yield of $80 mg of homogeneous protein per liter of culture. Based on the results of size exclusion the molecular weight of this protein was calculated approximately 120 and 240 kDa as a dimer and tetramer, respectively. Approximately 80% of the total protein eluted as a dimer and 20% as a tetramer (data not shown). These results support previous reports that MenD from various organisms behave as a dimer or a tetramer, or both [4,13]. In contrast to previous EcMenD crystallization conditions [13,16], we obtained first time the apoenzyme crystal with tetragonal form having dissimilar space groups and unit cell parameters. Initially, very irregular micro crystals were observed from the dimer protein; however, after optimization, tetragonal shaped crystals were observed when a reservoir solution containing 0.5­0.6 M tri-Na citrate was used over a period of one month. Flash-cooled EcMenD crystal using 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol as a cryo-protectant was diffracted to 2.7 Å. Auto-indexing was conducted using DENZO, and the results indicated that the crystal was a member of the tetragonal space group P41212 on the basis of systematic absences and with following unit cell parameters: a = b = 118.0, c = 176.4 Å, and a = b = c = 90°. These results indicate that two monomers are likely present in the asymmetric unit, which has a corresponding calculated Matthews's coefficient (VM) of 2.42 Å3 DaÀ1 and a solvent content of 49.5% [17]. Data-collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1. Structure determination We have determined the crystal structure of apo EcMenD forming dimeric structure. Two independent subunits of an EcMenD homodimer in the asymmetric unit adopt similar conformations. When we superposed the A and B chains for 530 Ca (except 175­ 177 and 471­493) within the dimer EcMenD structure, the overlay with a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.30 Å. However, a higher r.m.s.d. 0.61 Å was observed when compared with the recently reported holoenzyme E. coli MenD [13], suggesting some sort of conformational change among them. Monomer structure of EcMenD comprised of 23 a-helices and 17 b-stranded unequally divided within 3 domains (Fig. 1A). Continuous electron density was observed for almost the entire polypeptide chains in the apo

domain I having 195 residues show similar topology with domain III (Val347­Leu556), each consisting of a central six-stranded parallel b-sheet sandwiched between several a-helices. Whereas, the central domain II, which spans residues Asp213­His337, contains 5 b-sheet and 7 a-helices (Fig. 1A). It was reported that MenD is not dependent on the binding of FAD nucleotide in domain II, and the overlay of EcMenD with POX (pyruvate oxidase) having similar topology shows that the nucleotide-binding region of POX is replaced by the loop linking b11 with a11 in EcMenD (data not shown). This loop appears, therefore, to substitute for the stabilizing effect of ThDP-dependent enzymes. Various interactions between domain I (sandwich of 7 a-helices and 6 b-stranded) and domain III (9 a-helices and 6 b-stranded) of EcMenD contribute to form the dimer. The crystal structure of EcMenD generates the crystallographic 2-fold axis corresponding with subunits A and B. We estimated about 31 water molecules exist within 3 Å radius, playing an important role in dimer formation and stabilization. Four salt bridge interactions are also involved that stabilize the dimer. Approximately 50% residues at the interface are nonpolar, indicating a significant contribution of van der Waals forces to oligomerization. Analysis of the dimer interface indicates that approximate 13% (2600 Å2) of the surface area of a monomer (20160 Å2) is occluded on formation of the dimer. Flexibility increases without ThDP A previous report suggests that the ThDP binding site in EcMenD, in common with all other ThDP-dependent enzymes, is formed by contributions from the two subunits that comprise the dimer, is lacking in our apo structure. The residues important for cofactor binding are contributed from domains I and III, the most highly conserved domains across MenD sequences. The region between b15 and a21, residue 472­488 (A chain) and residue 471­ 493 (B chain) is found disorder or have a weak density map, corresponding to the high flexible loop binding region for the cofactor ThDP. This region is ordered in a previously reported holoenzyme structure [13]. Glu55 (in a3) is strictly conserved in MenD sequences, and mutagenesis of this residue abolishes enzyme activity. Glu55, together with Asp54 and Arg56, forms a conserved motif in MenD. A network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges formed by Asp54 and Arg56 with the equivalent residues in the partner subunit and the presence of Tyr447 form a tight turn at the start of a3 and, together with the bulk of the aromatic side

EcMenD structure, however, there was no or weak electron density for residues Tyr175, Gly176 and Glu177 observed. These are in the loop linking b6 and a7, a region of polypeptide that displays high thermal parameters in both subunits (Fig. 1B). A long loop, of 17 residues (Asp196­Arg212) is behaving as a linker region between domains I and II, whereas, Pro338­Cys346 connecting domains II and III. Average B-factor of EcMenD is 29.7 Å2, however, almost double B-factor observed for the region Ala29­Leu36 (b1­a2), Glu172­Asp179 (b6­a7), Asn469­Gly471 (b15­a21), corresponding to the high flexible loop region or the region near the disordered loop (Fig. 1B). Mutation of residue P36L (a2, region Ala29­ Leu36) in this structure shows some conformational change with 1.1 Å r.m.s.d. compared to the holoenzyme structure [13]. The EcMenD subunit and dimer formation The EcMenD subunit has approximately 62% of residues in elements of secondary structure and displays the three-domain architecture typical of ThDP-dependent enzymes [6].

EcMenD structure. These five conserved arginine residues could potentially interact with three carboxylate and one hydroxyl group of the substrates helping to align the reagents for catalysis. Side chains of these arginine participate in hydrogen-bonding interactions that serve to position them in the active site properly (data not shown). ThDP improves protein stability To evaluate the structural integrity, the conformation of EcMenD was analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The far-UV CD spectra of EcMenD showed that it retained a well-folded structure at pH 8.0. However, it was destabilized by the addition of 1 mM AKG and ellipticity was decreased. A higher concentration of AKG completely degraded the protein and it became aggregated at 5 and 10 mM AKG (data not shown). On the other hand, the protein was stabilized by the addition of FAD and was even more stabilized and became more structured in the presence of ThDP (Fig. 3A). By the addition of cofactors there was no change in the beta sheet content, which remains at the zero level. While major change was observed in randomly structured residues that were changed to a more helical content basically with ThDP. The structure of EcMenD was highly dependent on ThDP, suggesting that ThDP at certain concentration contributes to the protein stability; the same phenomenon was also observed in the case of holoenzyme EcMenD crystal formation, where ThDP favored the crystal formation by bringing protein in better conformation to develop a more ordered structure. The integrity of the protein structure was also confirmed by the thermal unfolding experiment. The unfolding transition temperature (Tm) was observed to be 53 °C in the case of EcMenD protein only, 57.3 °C in the case of EcMenD protein complex with ThDP, and 54 °C in the case of EcMenD protein complex with AKG, while the Tm was 54.5 °C in the case of EcMenD protein with FAD. Protein with ThDP showed better thermal stability illustrating the highly stable nature of EcMenD with ThDP (Fig. 3B). Previous reports suggest that holoenzyme conditions was not stable while using ultra centrifugation [13], however, our CD results suggest that binding with ThDP improves stability. EcMenD protein with

chain, make contributions to the assembly of the MenD dimer and serve to position Glu55 to bind the cofactor, thereby influencing the tautomeric state of the pyrimidine. Interestingly, region Tyr489­Asn494 of chain A as a flexible loop (ThDP binding region) moves towards region Gly182­Asp195 (a7) of another asymmetric unit (Fig. 2), lies within 4$3.5 Å distance range. ThDP-dependent enzymes are usually oligomeric [13]. The EcMenD active site is, as described, formed by contributions from two subunits. The wall of the cavity is primarily basic due to the presence of five arginine residues (Arg33A, Arg107A, Arg395A, Arg293B, and Arg413B). The residues Ile474B, Phe475B, and Leu478B creating a hydrophobic patch on one side of the active site, important for binding the cofactor ThDP as described earlier [13] was missing in our apo

The individual spectra are as follows: EcMenD protein only (s), EcMenD protein and AKG (d), EcMenD protein and ThDP (j) and EcMenD protein and FAD (h). Corresponding buffer blanks were subtracted from data before plotting molar ellipticity.

Temperature varied from 5 to 100 °C at 222 nm, Tm was observed to be 53.0 °C in the case EcMenD protein only; 53.8 °C in the case of EcMenD protein with AKG; 57.2 °C in the case of EcMenD protein with ThDP and 54.4 °C in the case of EcMenD protein with FAD. Protein with ThDP showed better thermal stability as well as structural stability as compared to other cofactors.

Fig. 4. Thermogram from Isothermal calorimetric analysis showing EcMenD has high affinity with ThDP as KD value of 0.152 lM.

ThDP showed better thermal stability, as well as structural stability, as compared to other cofactors. Dissociation constants assessed for EcMenD by isothermal titration calorimetry shows high affinity for ThDP (Fig. 4), with KD values of approximately 0.152 lM. This data support that MenD is dependent on ThDP for its activity [6]. In summary, we report first time the crystal structure of MenD in apo form from E. coli determined in a tetragonal crystal form. Here, we describe the cofactor binding pocket and dimer interface of EcMenD contributing the molecule stability in details. As well as, CD and ITC results confirm EcMenD dependency on ThDP, helps to stabilize the structure. The differences observed between our apo and previous holoenzyme structure suggests that ThDP and metal ion binding are key responsible factors inducing gross conformational changes and structure stability. Our structural and biological analyses results provide insights into how this enzyme depended on ThDP cofactor and act as a bifunctional enzyme.
