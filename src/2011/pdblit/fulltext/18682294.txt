Abstract Structural determinants underlaying the pH-dependent dimer­tetramer transition of Diocleinae lectins were investigated from the structures of Cratylia Xoribunda seed lectin crystallized in conditions where it exist as a dimer (pH 4.6) or as a tetramer (pH 8.5). The acidic (aCFL) and the basic (bCFL) tetramers superimpose with overall r.m.s.d. of 0.53 Å, though interdimer contacts are drastically reduced in aCFL, and the r.m.s.d. for the superposition of the 117­120 loops of aCFL vs. the bCFL tetramer is 1.29 Å. Our data support the view that His51 plays a role in determining the conformation of the central cavity loops and that interdimer contacts involving ordered loop residues stabilize the canonical, pH-dependent tetramer. In the bCFL tetramer, hydrogen bonds between Asn118 and Thr120 of monomers A and D and residues Ser66, Ser108, Ser110, and Thr49 of the opposite monomer stabilize the canonical, pH-dependent tetrameric lectin structure. In CFL, Asn131 makes intradimer contacts with Asn122 and Ala123. In comparison, His131 in Dioclea grandiXora lectin establishes a network of interdimer interactions bridging the four central loops of the pH-independent tetramer. Our data provide new insights into the participation of speciWc amino acid residues in the mechanism of the quaternary association of Diocleinae lectins. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Lectins are deWned as proteins of non-immune origin possessing at least one non-catalytic domain that binds reversibly to a speciWc mono- or oligosaccharide (Van Damme et al., 1998). Lectins are ubiquitous carbohydratebinding proteins in animals, plants and microorganisms, which decipher the glycocodes encoded in the structure of glycans in processes such as cell communication, host defense, fertilization, development, parasitic infection, tumor metastasis, and plant defense against herbivores and pathogens (Gabius and Gabius, 1997). Mechanisms for

sugar recognition have evolved independently in a small number of protein folds (Van Damme et al., 1998) (consult also the 3D Lectin Database at http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/ lectines/). Carbohydrate recognition sites are usually preformed at shallow grooves on the protein surface, and carbohydrate selectivity is achieved through a combination of hydrogen bonds between sugar hydroxyl groups and protein main-chain and side-chain groups, water-mediated contacts, van der Waals packing of the hydrophobic sugar ring face against an aromatic residue, and, hydrophobic interactions (Weis and Drickamer, 1996; Elgavish and Shaanan, 1997). Lectins sharing a common structural fold may depart in their carbohydrate-binding speciWcities and multivalence is frequently used by lectins for increasing their glycan binding avidity and speciWcity (Drickamer, 1995; Rini, 1995). Hence, most lectins are oligomeric or

multidomain proteins. Moreover, variability in the quaternary association of lectins with the same tertiary fold (Prabu et al., 1999; Vijayan and Chandra, 1999; Bouckaert et al., 1999; Chandra et al., 2001; Loris, 2002) appear to have been widely used by evolution for adapting homologous lectins to the diVerent spacings and orientations of the lectin's carbohydrate ligands on soluble and cell surfaceexposed glycoproteins. Legume lectins, despite having essentially the same tertiary fold, the jelly-roll domain, exhibit considerable diversity in the modes in which their monomers oligomerize into dimers and tetramers with small changes in their amino acid sequences (Prabu et al., 1999; Chandra et al., 2001; Srinivas et al., 2001). For this reason, legume lectins have been referred to as "natural mutants of quaternary state" by Srinivas et al. (2001). The tetrameric assembly of Diocleinae subtribe seed lectins from the Dioclea, Cratylia, and Canavalia genera of the Papilionoideae subfamily (Leguminosae family) involves a cross-wise back to back association of two side-by-side dimers built by the antiparallel alignment of their Xat six-stranded back -sheets, and called the `canonical' quaternary association Wrst characterized in the crystal structure of concanavalin A (Hardman and Ainsworth, 1972; Edelman et al., 1972; Reeke et al., 1975). Diocleinae lectins exhibit pH-dependent dimer­tetramer equilibria (Calvete et al., 1999). The physiological relevance of this phenomenon remains poorly understood thus far. However, it is worth to note that the centre of the tetramer is a water-Wlled cavity of about 25 £ 8 Å2, and several studies have indicated that ConA and other leguminous lectins binds various non-polar compounds, such as the plant auxin -indoleacetic acid and cytokinins, independently of its saccharide-binding activity (Edelman and Wang, 1978; Roberts and Goldstein, 1983). Auxins and cytokinins function as plant growth hormones and thus the lectins could use dimer­tetramer equilibrium as a mechanism for storage or transport of hormones. Huet and Claverie (1978) have reported the kinetics of the reversible dimer­tetramer transition of concanavalin A, Senear and Teller (1981a,b) have studied the eVects of temperature and pH by sedimentation equilibrium, showing that the self-association of this lectin was strictly a dimer to tetramer transition over the pH range 5.5­7.5. From the values of the ionization thermodynamic parameters, the authors concluded that the self-association reaction was entropically driven and that the ionization state of a histidine side chain on each subunit, either His51 or His121, governed the dimer­tetramer transition of the lectin. We have solved the crystal structure of Dioclea guianensis (Dguia) seed lectin (PDB access codes 1H9P and H9W) (Wah et al., 2001). The amino acid sequence of Dguia departs in only nine residues from that of the seed lectin from Dioclea grandiXora (Dgran). Dguia exhibits pHdependent dimer­tetramer equilibrium above pH 5.5 while Dgran (PDB code 1DGL) (Rozwarski et al., 1998) exists as a tetramer in the pH range 4.5­8.5 (Calvete et al., 1999). Comparison of the crystal structures of Dguia and Dgran

indicated that a single amino acid diVerence at position 131 (Asn in Dguia and His in Dgran) accounts for the distinct interdimer interactions in Dguia compared to the Dgran structure that yield their diVerent quaternary associations (Wah et al., 2001). We have noticed that Diocleinae lectins with dimer­tetramer equilibrium possess an Asn at position 131, including the seed lectins from Canavalia bonariensis, Cratylia Xoribunda, Dioclea rostrata and Dioclea virgata. On the other hand, the Dioclea violacea seed lectin, which like Dgran is tetrameric in the pH range 4.5­8.5, possess His131 (Calvete et al., 1999). To gain deeper insight into structural determinants underlaying Diocleinae lectin pH-dependent quaternary association, we have now determined the crystal structures of the seed lectin from C. Xoribunda at two pHs at which the lectin in solution exists as a dimer (4.5) or as a tetramer (8.5). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. PuriWcation and characterization of the C. Xoribunda seed lectin The lectin from C. Xoribunda was puriWed from seeds collected from plants growing at the Campus of the Federal University of Ceará (Fortaleza, Northeast of Brazil) by aYnity chromatography as described (Cavada et al., 1998). Its N-terminal sequence ( -chain and -fragment, ADTIVAVELDTYPNT; -fragment, STADAQSLHFT FNQFS) determined using an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 sequencer); isotope-averaged molecular mass ( -chain, residues 1­237, 25,398 Da; -fragment, residues 1­118, 12,850 Da; -fragment, residues 119­237, 12,568 Da) determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (using an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-Pro instrument); and tryptic peptide mass Wngerprinting, conWrmed the identity of the puriWed lectin with that in the SwissProt entry P81517. Apparent molecular masses of the puriWed C. Xoribunda seed lectin in solutions of diVerent pHs were determined by analytical ultracentrifugation at 20 °C as described (Calvete et al., 1999). 2.2. Crystallization, data collection and model building The Sparse matrix method (Jancarik and Kim, 1991) using the crystal screen I and II formulations supplied by Hampton Research (California, USA) was utilized to perform initial screening of crystallization conditions. Crystals of the C. Xoribunda seed lectin (CFL) were grown at 295 K by the vapour-diVusion method using hanging drops composed of equal volumes of protein solution (20 mg ml¡1 in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.6 containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM MnCl2) and reservoir buVers (a) 16% PEG 4000, 125 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and (b) 16% PEG 4000, 125 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. The Wnal pH values of the droplets were determined using pH indicator test strips (narrow ranges pH 3­6 and 5­9) (Merck). In addition, CFL crystals were

on discrete 1° oscillation frames. Data were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992), scaled with SCALA and processed using TRUNCATE (Collaborative Computer Program No. 4, 1994). Molecular replacement was performed using the coordinates of concanavalinA (2CNA) as the search model in AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). ReWnement was performed using REFMAC (Collaborative Computer Program No. 4, 1994) and manual model building was done in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). Final models were checked with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Molecular representations shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6, 7 were generated using MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991). 3. Results and discussion

For a strict dimer­tetramer transition, apparent molecular masses between 51 kDa (D, dimer) and 102 kDa (T, tetramer) correspond to Mapp D (%D £ 51 + %T £ 102) kDa.

3.1. Molecular and crystal structures of the C. Xoribunda lectin in acidic and basic conditions Equilibrium sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation clearly showed that the C. Xoribunda seed lectin (CFL) behaves as a dimeric protein at pH below 4.5 (Mcalc: 51 kDa) and as a tetramer above pH 6.5 (Mcalc: 102 kDa) (Fig. 1). The apparent molecular masses between these two aggregation states indicate the existence of dimer­tetramer equilibrium in the intermediate pH range. CFL was crystallized in conditions where the lectin is dimeric (pH 4.5) or tetrameric (pH 8.5). The Wnal pH values in the droplets were, respectively, between 4­5 and 8­9 (determined with pH indicator test strips) or 4.4 and 8.3 in the diluted sitting droplets. The crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement using ConA coordinates. Each monomer of the acidic (aCFL) and the basic (bCFL) crystal forms of CFL include one calcium and one manganese ion binding sites with identical amino acid residue coordination shell as found in the ConA search model. All residues in the crystallographic model of aCFL and 235 out of the 236 residues of

also grown in 100 l sitting droplets using the same conditions as above. 50 l of these droplets were diluted 1:10 (v/v) with MilliQ® water (Millipore) (resistivity 18.3 M cm, pH 6.95) and the pH values were measured with a conventional pH electrode. In either condition, crystals suitable for diVraction analysis grew to maximal dimensions of 0.6 £ 0.4 £ 0.2 mm3 within two weeks. For X-ray diVraction studies, crystals were cryocooled at 100 K in a nitrogen-gas stream. Reservoir buVer containing in addition 10% PEG 400 proved to be a suitable cryoprotectant. The crystals were transferred directly from the drop to the cryoprotectant solution and were allowed to equilibrate for approximately 20 s. Thereafter, single crystals were mounted in nylon loops and rapidly transferred to the cryostream. The cryoprotected crystals were analysed on beamline BM16 at ESRF (Grenoble, France). DiVraction data were collected

Data collection and Wnal reWnement statistics are shown in Table 1, and the atomic coordinates of the C. Xoribunda seed lectin crystallized at acidic and basic pH have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) and have accession codes 2D3R and 2D3P, respectively. As expected from their high (»80­85%) amino acid sequence identity, the basic topology of the C. Xoribunda seed lectin protomer is essentially that of the canonical legume lectin fold reported in the crystal structures of a number of Leguminosae lectins (http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/lectines/), including the structure of the Cratylia mollis seed lectin (De Souza et al., 2003), from which CFL departs only in 10 residues, and will thus not be further discussed here. Rather, structural diVerences between the aCFL and bCFL crystal structures are discussed below. It appears notable that both, the aCFL and the bCFL, crystals belong to the orthorrhombic space group P212121 (Table 1) and contained 4 subunits in the asymmetric unit (Matthews's coeYcient (VM) of 2.4 Å3/Da and a solvent content of 48%). Bouckaert and colleagues (Bouckaert et al., 1996) have also noticed that in crystals grown in acidic conditions ConA dimers associate into tetramer-like oligomers. This is also true for every Diocleinae lectin crystal space group reported up to now (http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/lectines/), where a tetramer-like structure is present as part or as the complete asymmetric unit in crystals of the seed lectins from Canavalia ensiformis (ConA,

I222, P1, P21, P212121, P21212, P21221, C121, C2221, I213, and F222), Canavalia brasiliensis (P212121), Dioclea grandiXora (P3121), D. guianensis (I4122 and P43212), and Cratylia mollis (I222). This evidence strongly supports the view that the tetramer may represent a favourable packing in the crystal nucleation process. We argued that comparison of the same lectin structure crystallized at diVerent pH values may provide insights into the structural basis of the pHdependent dimer­tetramer transition. Thus, tetramerization forced by the crystal packing (crystalline tetramer) of in-solution lectin dimers may not involve the same interdimeric contacts as those established in low concentration solutions (canonical pH-dependent tetramer). 3.2. Comparison of CFL tetramers crystallized in acidic and in basic pHs The aCFL and the bCFL tetramers can be superimposed with an overall r.m.s. deviation of only 0.53 Å for all C atoms (Fig. 2). Interdimer contacts in the `canonical tetramer' are made between the homologous regions encompassing residues 53­78 of monomers A and D and B and C at the periphery of the dimers (Fig. 2), and between the loop comprising residues 117­120 of each monomer located in the water-Wlled cavity at the centre of the tetramer (Fig. 2, Table 2). Interactions at the peripheral contact sites are essentially conserved in the aCFL and the bCFL tetramers and these interface regions can be superpimosed with an r.m.s.deviation of 0.42 Å (Fig. 3). In contrast, the number of

interdimer contacts in the central cavity are drastically reduced in the aCFL (Table 2, Fig. 4) and the r.m.s. deviation for the superposition of the 117­120 loops between the aCFL

and the bCFL tetramers is 1.29 Å. The reduced number of interdimer contacts yielding a "weakened" tetrameric association of aCFL is due by increased distances between atoms

which are hydrogen-bonded in bCFL as a consequence of the distinct spatial orientation of residues His51, Ser66, Ser110, Thr117, Asn118, Ser119 and Thr120 in aCFL and bCFL (Table 2, Fig. 4). The more compact structure of the

basic form of CFL is in line with the shorter unit cell dimensions of bCFL crystals compared to those of the crystals grown at acidic pH (Table 1). In addition, the mean overall B-factors of the aCFL and bCFL tetramers (34.9 vs. 20.8 A2), as well as those calculated for each monomer are signiWcantly higher in the aCFL than in the bCFL tetramer (aCFL/ bCFL: monomer A, 32.4/20.1; monomer B, 35.9/16.7; monomer C, 37.7/22.2; monomer D, 34.1/24.6 A2). The B-factors of the central loops 117­120 of monomers A­D are also higher in the aCFL than in bCFL crystalline tetramer (aCFL/ bCFL: monomer A, 43.4/38.9 A2; monomer B, 46.7/42.1 A2; monomer C, 50.3/37.1 A2; monomer D, 43.6/39.4 A2). As a whole, these data pointed to a more stabilized tetrameric structure of bCFL (crystallized as a tetramer) than aCFL (presumably forced to form tetramers by crystal packing). Residues His51, Arg60, Asn55, Asp78, Asn118 and Ser119 are absolutely conserved in legume lectins that adopt the cross-wise, ConA-type tetrameric association (Calvete et al., 1999) classiWed as type II by (Brinda et al., 2004). As a whole, the data indicate that both, the peripheral and the central interacting regions bear structural information for formation of the cross-wise, ConA-type tetramer, although the crystallographic (weak or `artiWcial') quaternary association driven by crystallization at pH 4.6 involves fewer atomic interactions between the central cavity loops than in the `canonical' (solution-stable) tetramer at pH 8.5. Comparison of the interdimer contacts involving residues of the central loops in the lectin tetramers crystallized at basic and acidic conditions (Table 2) strongly indicate that hydrogen bonds between Asn118 and Thr120 of monomers A and D and residues Ser66, Ser108, Ser110 and

are disordered and the residue at position 131, asparagine, is unable to reproduce the interdimer contacts found in Dgran (Wah et al., 2001). The C. Xoribunda lectin represents an intermediate case: like Dguia, it possesses Asn131, and in the structures crystallized at acidic as well as at basic pH, the Fourier diVerence maps allowed tracing of the central 117­123 loop of each monomer, although it must be noticed that this region showed poor electron density (Fig. 5). The reason for the presence of an ordered central loop in a lectin exhibiting pH-dependent tetrameric association resides in the conformation of His51. Hence, a comparison of the crystal structures of the three Diocleinae lectins reveals that in Dguia His51 participates in intramonomer contacts with Asp192, Ala193, and Thr194 whereas, this residue in the C. Xoribunda and in the D. grandiXora seed lectins is rotated towards the opposite monomer and establishes both intramonomer contact (with Thr194) and a network of intermonomer interactions with Val187 and with the central loop residues Lys116, Thr117 and Ser119 (Fig. 6). In particular, the latter interactions point to a hitherto unrecognized crucial role for His51 in stabilizing the central loop conformation, and indicate that the ordered conformation of the central loops does not necessary lead to the stabilization of a pH-independent tetramer.

4. Concluding remarks The structural evidence gathered from comparison of the crystal structures of the C. Xoribunda seed lectin crystallographic and canonical tetramers supports the view that interdimer contacts between ordered central cavity loops play a major role in stabilizing the canonical, pH-dependent tetrameric structure. The fact that His51 appears to play a prominent role in maintaining the ordered conformation of the central loops in both the D. grandiXora (1DGL, pH-independent tetramer) and the C. Xoribunda (2D3P, pH-dependent tetramer) lectins refutes the hypothesis that the tetramerization of ConA (and other Diocleinae lectins) may be solely driven by the ionization state of this histidine residue. Moreover, in all ConA crystal structures,

Thr49 of the opposite monomer (Table 2), may be crucial for stabilizing the canonical, pH-dependent tetrameric C. Xoribunda lectin structure. In crystals of D. grandiXora seed lectin (Dgran) (1DGL) (Rozwarski et al., 1998), the central loops are clearly visible and a histidine residue at position 131 orchestrates a network of interdimer interactions bridging the central loops from the four monomers, and stabilizing thereby the pHindependent tetrameric structure. In the pH-dependent D. guianensis seed lectin (Dguia) tetramer, the central loops

Fig. 7. Comparison of interdimer contacts between the central loops and residue 131 in the crystal structures of the D. grandiXora (1DGL) (A) and the C. Xoribunda (2D3P) (B) seed lectins. Hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions are represented by red and blue broken lines, respectively.

the loop 117­123 is disordered despite the fact that His51 adopts the same conformation as in the C. Xoribunda and the D. grandiXora lectin structures, suggesting that ConA His51 does not interact with central loop residues and may thus not participate in the central loop structuring mechanism. On the other hand, comparison of the interdimer contact interfaces of the C. Xoribunda and the D. grandiXora lectins, both exhibiting well-ordered central loop conformations, indicates that Asn131 (2D3P) is unable to reproduce the network of interactions by which His131 of 1DGL bridges homologous loops of opposite monomers, stabilizing thereby the pH-independent quaternary structure of the D. grandiXora lectin (Fig. 7). Thus, the central loops can adopt an ordered conformation through diVerent mechanisms involving His51 and His131. Loop ordering through a His51-dependent mechanism alone (CFL) does not stabilize a pH-stable tetramer. On the other hand, central loop ordering through a His131-dependent mechanism yields a pH-independent tetrameric lectin (Dgran). The apparent paradox that a His residue (pKa 5.5­7.5) determines pH independence might be explained assuming that the network of intermonomer contacts centered at His131 can not be disrupted by altering the pH value of the solution in the range 4.5­8.5. The absence of the stabilizing intermonomeric interactions (i.e. when Asn occupies position 131) allows pH-dependent destabilization of the tetrameric lectin structure. This view reinforces our hypothesis of the key role of the side chain of the residue at position 131 for determining the pH dependence or independence of the tetrameric association of the seed lectins from Diocleinae. A Wnal forecast of this conclusion is that any residue capable of establishing intermonomeric interactions between the central cavity loops 117­123 within a ConA-like tetramer would render a pH-independent tetrameric lectin. Sitedirected mutagenesis experiments are underway in our laboratories to test this hypothesis.
