Abstract CD2 associated protein (CD2AP) is an adaptor protein that plays an important role in cell to cell union needed for the kidney function. CD2AP interacts, as an adaptor protein, with different natural targets, such as CD2, nefrin, c-Cbl and podocin. These proteins are believed to interact to one of the three SH3 domains that are positioned in the N-terminal region of CD2AP. To understand the network of interactions between the natural targets and the three SH3 domains (SH3-A, B and C), we have started to determine the structures of the individual SH3 domains. Here we present the high-resolution structure of the SH3-C domain derived from NMR data. Full backbone and sidechain assignments were obtained from triple-resonance spectra. The structure was determined from distance restraints derived from high-resolution 600 and 800 MHz NOESY spectra, together with phi and psi torsion angle restraints based on the analysis of 1HN, 15N, 1Ha, 13Ca, 13 CO and 13Cb chemical shifts. Structures were calculated using CYANA and refined in water using RECOORD. The three-dimensional structure of CD2AP SH3-C contains all the features that are typically found in other SH3 domains,

including the general binding site for the recognition of polyproline sequences.

Biological context The CD2 associated protein (CD2AP) is a cytosolic protein expressed in podocytes, the cells of kidney glomerulus, which form the barrier between blood and urine and therefore plays a crucial role in renal ultra-filtration (Dustin et al. 1998). CD2AP acts as an adaptor protein, which facilitates interaction of its targets and is involved in cytosolic transport along microtubules. Among others, CD2, nephrine, podocine and c-Cbl have so far been identified as natural targets. Its possible important role in renal functionality is underlined by its involvement in several renal diseases like the hereditary nephritic syndrome (Wolf and Stahl 2003). The domain structure of CD2 consists of three N-terminal SH3 (Src-Homology) domains followed by a poly-proline region, and a globular domain linked to a C-terminal coiled-coil region. Intermolecular interactions

known so far are mostly mediated via the three N-terminal SH3 domains, named A, B and C, and also via the polyproline linker region, which is possibly also involved in intramolecular interactions. SH3 domains are a very good example of the modular structure of nature: they are found in various proteins where they exert their typical function: molecular recognition and subsequent binding (Mayer 2001). Although they form a highly conserved family of domains, their amino acid composition varies at a few key sites, allowing for a wide range of molecular targets. To understand the network of interactions between the natural targets of CD2AP and the three SH3 domains (SH3-A, B and C), we have started to determine the structures of the individual SH3 domains. The structures of the first and second SH3 domains of the CD2AP human analogue, CMS, have ´ recently been solved by X-ray diffraction (Moncalian et al. 2006) and NMR (Yao et al. 2007), respectively. Here we present the high resolution structure of the third SH3 domain of CD2AP.

carbon, respectively. Sample concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 13,980 M­1 cm­1, determined using the Gill and von Hippel method (Gill and von Hippel 1989).

NMR Spectroscopy N-labelled and 15N/13C-labelled samples of CD2AP SH3C were prepared for NMR experiments at 1 mM in 93% H2O/7% D2O, 50 mM NaPi, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT at pH 2.0. All NMR spectra were recorded at 25°C on a Varian NMR Direct-Drive Systems 600 MHz spectrometer (1H frequency of 600.25 MHz) equipped with a tripleresonance PFG-XYZ probe. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (2D NOESY, 125 ms mixing time) spectra were acquired on an unlabelled sample in D2O. 2D heteronuclear single quantum correlation (15N-HSQC), 15N-TOCSY-HSQC (mixing time of 80 ms) and 15N-NOESY-HSQC (mixing time of 125 ms) were acquired on a 15N-labelled sample both at 600 MHz as well as on a Varian Inova 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance PFG-Z cold probe. Triple resonance spectra CBCA(CO)NH, HNCA CB, HNCO, HBHA(CO)NH, aromatic (HB)CB(CGCD) HD/(HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE and HCCH-TOCSY were recorded at 600 MHz on a 13C/15N-labelled sample. All NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995) and analyzed by NMRView (Johnson and Blevins 1994).

Methods and results Protein expression and purification The plasmid pETM-11 (Protein Expression and Purification Core Facility, EMBL Heidelberg, Germany) containing the SH3-C gene covalently linked to a N-terminal 6xHis tag and a TEV protease cleavage site was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3) strain (Novagen). Cells were grown on LB medium four times the volume of the M9 minimal medium at 37°C till an OD600 of 0.7. After two washing steps cells were resuspended for 1 h in M9 medium at 20°C. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG at 20°C during 15­20 h. Cells were resuspended after centrifugation at 4000 RPM for 20 min in 50 mM phosphate, 0.3 M NaCl, pH 8.0 buffer (Column Buffer: CB) and broken in a French press. After centrifugation at 30,000 RPM during 30 min, the supernatant was loaded on 5 ml of Ni-sepharose resin (Pharmacia) equilibrated with CB. The protein was eluted with a gradient of CB from 0 to 500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing SH3-C were dialyzed against TEV buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA) to eliminate imidazole. The His-tag was cleaved by incubation at room temperature overnight with TEV protease in presence of 1 mM ditiothreitol. The cleaved SH3-C was recovered by a final chromatography step on a Superdex G75 gel-filtration column. 15N- and 13 15 C/ N-labelled proteins were purified from cells grown in M9 minimal medium containing either 15NH4Cl (Cortecnet) or 15NH4Cl and (13C6)D-glucose (Spectra Stable Isotopes and Cortecnet) as the sole sources of nitrogen and

Assignment of the SH3-C domain of CD2AP A modified version of the SmartNotebook 3.2 tool integrated in NMRView was used to semi-automatically assign the protein backbone. The SmartNotebook module allows visual inspection of the backbone sequential connectivities and provides tools to assign segments of residues to the primary sequence based on characteristic carbon chemical shifts. Peaklists containing 13Ca and 13Cb frequencies taken from the HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH at the 1H,15N frequency of every peak in the HSQC spectrum were used as input for SmartNotebook, which then creates automatically connections between the 1H,15N pairs. 13CO frequencies were taken from the HNCO at the assigned 1 15 H, N frequencies. 1Ha and 1Hb were assigned using the HBHA(CO)NH. The obtained 1Ha-13Ca and 1Hb-13Cb frequencies were then used for the assignment of the 1H and 13C frequencies of aliphatic side chains from the HCCH-TOCSY spectrum. 1H resonances were checked by the combined use of the 15N-edited 3D-TOCSY and 3D-NOESY spectra. Aromatic 1Hd and 1He frequencies

were obtained from the combined use of the (HB)CB(CGCD)HD and (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE spectra, where the aromatic 1H frequencies are correlated with the assigned 13Cb frequencies of the aromatic residue. Missing aromatic 1H frequencies (e.g. those of Trp side chains) were assigned from a 1H,1H 2D-NOESY in D2O. Figure 1 shows an assigned 1N-15N HSQC spectrum of SH3-C that resulted from the assignment procedure ascribed above. The 1H, 15N and 13C assigned resonances have been deposited in the BioMagResBank database with accession code 15407. The structure of the SH3-C domain of CD2AP NOE cross peaks were obtained by manual peak picking in each strip of the 800 MHz 3D 15N-NOESY-HSQC spectra taken at the assigned 1H,15N frequencies and by automatic peak picking of the 600 MHz 2D NOESY in D2O followed by removal of diagonal peaks and peaks arising from artifacts (e.g. residual water). NOEs were assigned using

the automated NOE assignment procedure of CYANA ¨ version 2.1 (Guntert et al. 1997; Hermann et al. 2002). Phi and psi torsion angle restraints were included based on analysis of 1HN, 15N, 1Ha, 13Ca, 13CO and 13Cb chemical shifts using the program PREDITOR (Berjanskii et al. 2006). Only phi and psi angle restraints were used with a confidence factor higher than 0.5. The standard protocol was used with seven cycles of combined automated NOE assignment and structure calculation of 100 conformers in each cycle. This protocol was repeated ten times using different seeding numbers. Restraints that were unambiguously assigned in at least 5 out of 10 CYANA runs were used for a final structure calculation run using CNS (Brunger et al. 1998) in explicit solvent using the RECOORD protocol (Nederveen et al. 2005). The twenty lowest-energy structures were used for the final analysis. Input data and structure calculation statistics are summarized in Table 1. PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski et al. 1996) and WHATIF (Vriend 1990) were used to analyze the quality of the structures. MOLMOL (Koradi et al. 1996) and PYMOL (http://www.pymol.org/) were used for visualization. The structural coordinates and experimentally derived restraints have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 2JTE. Figure 2a shows a stereo representation of the superposition of the ensemble of 20 lowest-energy water-refined structures derived from the automatic NOE assignment protocol in CYANA and the subsequent refinement using RECOORD. The ensemble fulfils the experimental data very well (Table 1). Moreover, the ensemble of structures shows excellent Ramachandran statistics reflecting the high quality of the 3D structures. The success of the approach can be attributed to the use of high-quality 800 MHz 3D NOESY and 600 MHz 2D NOESY spectra and the almost complete set of assignments of almost all proton frequencies ([95%) used for the automatic NOE assignment stage and the addition of torsion angle restraints derived form the combination of selected 1H, 15N and 13C chemical shifts. The structural disorder observed for the N-terminus is consistent with the higher flexibility in this region of the protein as indicated by the smaller heteronuclear NOE values (Fig. 3a).

residues in the most ordered regions corresponding to an apparent rotational correlation time sm of 3.79 ns within the expected range for a monomeric 7 kDa protein. We also used TENSOR2 to perform a model-free analysis of the local internal mobility affecting the backbone amides in the presence of an isotropic tensor. All measured relaxation data can be adequately described by a single parameter, the order parameter S2, for most residues (Fig. 3c). Besides the seven N-terminal residues, the local internal mobility of residues 24 and 60 can only be described using an additional term for fast internal motions (se) or for exchange contributions (Rex), respectively.

Discussion and conclusions The 3D structure of CD2AP SH3-C shows the five b-strands and the 310 helix that are common in the family of SH3 domains (Fig. 2b). It also contains all the features that are typically found in other SH3 domains, including the general binding site for the recognition of polyproline

600.25 MHz using the experiments described previously (Farrow et al. 1994) on 15N-labelled SH3-C. The 1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs were determined from the ratio of peak intensities (Ion/Ioff) with and without the saturation of the amide protons for 3 s. 15N R1 and 15N R2 relaxation rates were measured from spectra with different relaxation delays: 10, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 700, 900, 1200 and 1500 ms for R1 and 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 150, 190 and 250 ms for R2. Relaxation parameters and their corresponding errors were extracted with the program NMRView. High NOE values (about 0.8) are observed for most of the SH3 domain chain, except for the 7 N-terminal residues and the C-terminal residue 64 (Fig. 3a). Analysis of the relaxation data of SH3-C using TENSOR2 (Dosset et al. 2000) indicate average 15N R2/R1 ratios (Fig. 3b) for 32

determination of the three SH3 domains that are present in CD2AP and in the human analogue CMS. As these three SH3 domains are believed to interact with different natural targets, it is interesting to compare our structure with the first and second SH3 domains of CMS. CD2AP SH3-C shares 41% sequence identity with both CMS SH3-A and SH3-B. A homology search through the sequence databank also shows a 41% sequence identity with the first SH3 domain of CIN85 (Jozic et al. 2005), a protein related to the human CMS. The CD2AP SH3-C structure described in our work is similar to the X-ray structure of the first SH3 domain of CIN85 (PDB entry 2BZ8), with a RMSD of ° 0.91 A for all backbone atoms excluding the flexible seven N-terminal and two C-terminal residues and the residues in the n-Src loop, which is different in length for the two proteins, but deviates more from the NMR structure of the ° CMS SH3-B domain (PDB entry 2FEI, RMSD of 1.16 A). CD2AP SH3-C, however, is closely similar to the X-ray structure of the CMS SH3-A domain (PDB entry 2J6F) with ° a RMSD of 0.78 A. Moreover, the aromatic residues that are involved in recognition of polyproline sequences (shown in Fig. 2b and c) are very similar positioned in the two structures. As these two closely similar SH3 domains are part of the same adaptor protein, their binding specificity must come from small differences at specific sites in the two domains, enabling to recognize and bind to a specific partner. Future studies directed to resolve the structures of the complexes between these SH3 domains and their natural targets will hopefully lead to a detailed understanding on how these similar domains recognize different targets providing insight on how signaling is regulated by CD2AP. This may ultimately lead towards the design of specific drugs that might be used in treatments of renal diseases.
