Biogen, Inc., 14 Cambridge Center, Cambridge MA 02142, USA B cell activating factor (BAFF), a ligand belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, plays a critical role in regulating survival and activation of peripheral B cell populations and has been associated with autoimmune disease. BAFF is known to interact with three receptors, BCMA, TACI and BAFF-R, that have distant similarities with other receptors of the TNF family. We have determined the crystal structure of the Ê TNF-homologous domain of BAFF at 2.8 A resolution. The structure reveals signi®cant differences when compared to other TNF family members, including an unusually long D-E loop that participates in the formation of a deep, concave and negatively charged region in the putative receptor binding site. The BAFF structure was further used to generate a homology model of APRIL, a closely related TNF family ligand that also binds to BCMA and TACI, but not BAFF-R. Analysis of the putative receptor binding sites of BAFF and APRIL suggests that differences in the D-E loop structure and electrostatic surface potentials may be important for determining binding speci®cities for BCMA, TACI and BAFF-R.

Introduction
B cell activating factor (BAFF: also known as BlyS, TALL-1, THANK and zTNF4) is a recently identi®ed member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands.1 ± 3 It is a type II membrane protein that can exist in a soluble form, and is expressed in T-cells, monocytes and dendritic cells.3 Full-length BAFF is a trimeric molecule that

includes a globular extracellular TNF-homologous domain, an extracellular stalk, a short transmembrane segment and a small cytoplasmic domain. Data from several studies indicate that BAFF is a key regulator of the peripheral B cell population.2 ± 6 Speci®cally, investigators have demonstrated that BAFF recognizes a receptor expressed on B cells and acts to provide a survival signal, as well as a costimulatory signal for proliferation and immunoglobulin (Ig) production. Currently, three receptors for BAFF have been identi®ed: BCMA,5,7 TACI8,9 and BAFF-R.10 These receptors lack signal sequences and thus are classi®ed as type III membrane proteins. Although three cognate receptors exist for BAFF, recent data suggest that BAFF-R may be the primary receptor responsible for BAFFmediated function.10 Interestingly, two of the receptors, BCMA and TACI, also bind to APRIL, a TNF family member that shares a high level of sequence homology with BAFF.11 Recent data suggest that APRIL and BAFF may share some functional similarity,12 ± 14 although the role for APRIL in immunity is not clearly de®ned. Mounting evidence suggests strongly that BAFF may be a key player in autoimmune disease.

1146 Transgenic mice, where BAFF is overexpressed, exhibit increased numbers of peripheral B lymphocytes, elevated serum Ig levels and manifest an autoimmune phenotype similar to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with reduced kidney function.15 ± 17 Furthermore, the amount of BAFF in the serum of SLE patients is found to be elevated compared to healthy individuals.18,19 These results link overexpression of BAFF to antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and thereby suggest that BAFF may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, BAFF transgenic mice that were treated with a soluble receptor of BAFF exhibited a delay in the onset of severe nephritis.17 Although others have reported that, like BAFF, APRIL is capable of inducing B cell proliferation,12 there has been no evidence to date correlating APRIL with autoimmune pathology. Rather, APRIL has been implicated in cancer. Increased mRNA levels of APRIL have been detected in human tumor tissues and transformed cell lines as compared to normal tissues, and it was found that APRIL was capable of enhancing tumor proliferation.11 Furthermore, a soluble form of BCMA was able to inhibit tumor growth.20 The TNF family of ligands includes, among others, TNF-a, lymphotoxin-a (LT-a), lymphotoxinb (LT-b), CD40 ligand (CD40L), OX40 ligand (OX40L), Fas ligand, and Apo2L/TRAIL.21 Crystal structures have been determined for the TNF-homologous domains of TNF-a,22,23 LT-a,24 CD40L25 and Apo2L/TRAIL.26,27 The structures show that the TNF-homologous domains adopt a b-sheet sandwich motif. The TNF ligands induce a signal by binding to the corresponding TNF family receptors expressed on the surface of the target cell. Most TNF receptors are elongated molecules that consist of tandem repeats termed cysteine-rich domains (CRD) due to the high number of disul®de bridges contained within each repeat. A re®ned description of the modular structure of TNF family receptors suggests that the basic building block consists of modules that are roughly half a CRD in terms of size. These modules can be described in terms of a de®ned type, A, B, or C, and contain one or two disul®de bridges.28 Crystal structures of LT-a and Apo2L/TRAIL complexed with their cognate receptors provided insights into the common aspects of TNF family ligand-receptor recognition.29 ± 32 Importantly, the structures of the complexes showed how TNF ligands induce a signal by forming a hexameric complex with the receptors. The structural basis of the interaction of BAFF with its receptors is of particular interest because of the unusual characteristics of its receptors. Speci®cally, BCMA and BAFF-R are the only known TNF receptors that appear to contain only one CRD. In addition, sequence comparison indicates that BCMA, TACI and BAFF-R have only distant relationships to other members of the TNF receptor family.7,10 This may indicate the presence of unique folding motifs in the receptor extracellu-

lar domains and possibly novel modes of ligand binding. As a ®rst step in investigating and understanding the unique aspects of the structure and function of BAFF and its receptors, we report here the crystal structure of the TNF-homologous Ê domain of human BAFF at 2.8 A resolution. Structural comparisons of BAFF with other family members identify features that are likely critical for receptor binding. Furthermore, the structure of BAFF is used to model the closely related protein, APRIL, in order to gain insight into potentially shared structural characteristics, to understand lack of APRIL binding to BAFF-R, and to predict similarities and/or differences in binding of BAFF and APRIL to their shared receptors, BCMA and TACI. Lastly, the BAFF structure may have application in the rational design of therapeutic agents for the treatment of autoimmune disease.

Results and Discussion
Description of the structure A myc-tagged extracellular domain fragment of human BAFF (residues 136-285) was expressed in Pichia pastoris cells, puri®ed and crystallized. This molecule was shown to be fully functional for receptor binding in a B-cell proliferation experiment10 as well as in co-immunoprecipitation,20 FACS and ELISA experiments (T.G.C., unpublished results). The crystal structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and Ê re®ned to 2.8 A resolution. Despite the limited resolution range, all residues except the myc-tag and N-terminal residues 136-141 are uniformly well de®ned in the ®nal 2Fo À Fc electron density map (Figure 1). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two trimers of BAFF. The ®nal model consists of 864 amino acid residues constituting 6 polypeptide chains. The model has a crystallographic Rwork and Rfree of 21.7 % and 25.0 %, respectively, calculated using 29,043 re¯ections satisfying the conÊ dition F > 2s in the 30-2.8 A resolution range. The root mean square (rms) deviations on bond lengths Ê are 0.008 A and on bond angles are 1.4  . All nonglycine residues have f/c angles in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram, and 84.8 % of the residues have f/c angles in the mostfavored regions. Additional crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 1. Like other TNF family members, the crystallized BAFF fragment is a homotrimeric protein with an overall spherical shape (Figure 2). The dimensions Ê Ê Ê of the molecular trimer are 58 A Â 58 A Â 54 A. Each monomer folds as a sandwich of two antiparallel b-sheets with Greek-key topology. In our description, for the b-strands and other structural features we use the notation introduced for TNFa.23 We refer to the location of the N and C terminus as the bottom of the molecule, while the opposite end is referred to as the top of the molecule. The inner b-sheet is involved in monomer contacts and is composed of b-strands AHH , A, H, C and F

1147 the N-terminal end of the A strand that is free and partially exposed to the solvent. The three monomers are related to each other by a 3-fold axis that is aligned approximately with the b-strands of the monomers. The monomer interface is primarily hydrophobic, characterized by the participation of ®ve aromatic side-chain residues (Tyr192, Phe194, Tyr196, Tyr246 and Phe278). A three residue cluster is formed by Gln234 from each monomer on the 3-fold axis near the top of Ê the trimer. Approximately 945 A2 of monomer solvent-accessible surface is buried to form the trimer, and 56 % of that surface area is hydrophobic. The r.m.s positional deviation between equivalent residues from different BAFF monomers is Ê small (0.66 A). The deviation is mostly due to signi®cant differences in the conformation for the D-E loop. The rms positional deviation for the mainchain atoms of the D-E loop (residues Lys216Ê Ser225) is 1.59 A. Three different hairpin-like conformations are observed for the D-E loop. The ®rst one is adopted by four out of the six monomers and is stabilized by an internal hydrogen bond between the amide group of Glu223 and the carbonyl group of Phe220, as well as by interactions with symmetry-related molecules. The other two conformations are adopted by the ®fth and sixth monomers, respectively, and are characterized by the absence of any crystal contact for the loop. In one of the monomers, the loop is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between side-chain atom Oe1 of Glu223 and the amide nitrogen atom of Phe220.

(Figure 2(a)). The outer sheet contains most of the solvent-exposed residues and is composed of A1, A2, BH , B, G, D and E strands. The b-strands are connected by loops whose length varies considerably. The core of the protein is mostly hydrophobic but it also contains a few buried polar residues involved in polar interactions such as the hydrogen bond between the His210 and Tyr201 side-chains. Two cysteine residues (Cys232 of b-strand E and Cys245 of b-strand F) form a disul®de bridge, while a third cysteine residue (Cys146) is located at

Monomers are colored differently and b-strands and N and C-terminal residues are labeled for the green-colored monomer. Also shown in the ball-and-stick representation are the disul®de bridge in red and the glycosylation site Asn242 in turquoise. (b) Space®lling model of BAFF viewed along the 3-fold axis from the top of the trimer. The arrows point to the putative receptor binding sites. The Figure was made with RIBBONS.47

The side-chain of Glu223 is also stabilized by an interaction of Oe2 with the Nz of Lys216. Weak electron density is observed for the biantennary complex-type carbohydrate attached to residue Asn242 on the F strand of BAFF. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein material used for the crystallization indicated the presence of a BAFF component corresponding to the protein plus a glycan with a high mannose content (unpublished results). The electron density is not clear enough to allow model building of the carbohydrate residues; however, it is obvious that residues Tyr206 and Arg231 make contact with the carbohydrate. There is no crystal contact close to that region, and the rest of the carbohydrate is disordered within a large solvent channel in the crystal. Comparison with other TNF family members BAFF has a low level of sequence homology with other TNF family members: sequence alignments based on least-squares structural superimpositions indicate that the sequence identities with TNF-a, LT-a, CD40L and TRAIL are 21.5 %, 21.5 %, 17.4 % and 20.1 %, respectively (Figure 3). The corresponding rms positional deviations between all structurally equivalent Ca atoms are 2.1, 2.0, 2.1 Ê and 2.2 A. These values are of the same order as the previous sequence identity values and were calculated using 129, 129, 131 and 129 structurally equivalent Ca atoms, respectively (i.e. atoms that were not located in inserted or deleted sequence segments relative to the BAFF sequence). Interestingly, although the overall structure of BAFF is similar to that of other TNF family members, the length and conformation of the loops and certain

b-strands vary considerably. Furthermore, the BAFF crystal structure is the ®rst available of a group of TNF family members characterized by the presence of a disul®de bridge connecting b-strands E and F. As predicted by sequence homology, the sidechains and respective conformations of hydrophobic residues that are important components of the protein core of TNF family members, such as Trp168 and Phe279, are conserved. The size and position of the major b-strands are similar to those of other TNF family members, with the exception of strand F, which is markedly shorter, a possible consequence of a shorter connecting E-F loop . The ®rst loop that connects strands A and AHH is considerably long and contains two short b-strands (termed A1 and A2) that form an extension of the external b-sheet. Analogous b-strands have not been observed in the previously determined members of the TNF family, except for a strand, similar to A1, that has been observed in one of the available Apo2L/TRAIL structures.31 The conformation of the A-AHH loop is stabilized by the two short b-strands, as evidenced by the well-de®ned electron density. Another unique feature of the BAFF structure is the absence of the loop connecting AH and AHH strands. In the case of BAFF, these two strands form a single continuous AHH strand with a b-bulge in the middle. The C-D and E-F loops that are located at the top of the molecule are shorter than those observed in other TNF ligands. Their shorter length may account for the well-de®ned electron density that is not common for that region of TNF ligands. The most notable feature of the BAFF structure is an unusually long and extended D-E loop (residues Lys216-Ser225) (Figure 2). This appears to be the

1150 longest D-E loop of all known TNF ligand structures and corresponds to an insertion of 4-11 amino acid residues, depending on the TNF member with which it is compared. This loop is ¯exible, as evidenced by the presence of three different conformations within the crystal. Although the conformation of the G-H loop is generally conserved in the four previously determined structures of TNF family members, it is signi®cantly different in BAFF, particularly for the N-terminal portion of the loop (Pro264-Asn267). That area of the loop extends further away from the core of the molecule and is stabilized by several interactions including a hydrogen bond between Od1 of Asp203 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Ala268, as well as a hydrogen bond between Oe1 of Gln159 and the amide nitrogen atom of Asn267. The disul®de bridge connecting strands E and F may play a role in stabilizing the molecule. The bridge lies close to the 3-fold axis in a region of the molecule that frequently contains stabilizing elements that can be either disul®de bonds, such as in TNFa and CD40L, or a Zn2-binding site such as in Apo2L/TRAIL.27 Receptor binding site Since no structure-function data exist for BAFF, the location of the binding site for the three BAFF receptors (BCMA, TACI and BAFF-R) may only be inferred by analogy to what is known for other TNF receptor-ligand pairs. It is therefore expected to lie in the elongated cleft formed between adjacent monomers of a BAFF trimer (Figure 2). Three receptor binding sites are expected to exist for each BAFF trimer and roughly involve residues within the D-E, AHH -A, C-D and G-H loops and the C, D and F strands. The character of the putative binding-site surface of BAFF is mixed. There is almost no conservation of any binding-site residues relative to the LT-a and Apo2L/TRAIL. In the two cases of known TNF ligand-receptor complexes, the receptors are observed to be elongated molecules that bind along the whole length of the ligand cleft, making numerous contacts with the TNF ligand.29 ± 32 Two consecutive cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) from the receptors make contacts with the TNF ligand that can be grouped into two patches, the top patch (patch A) and the bottom patch (patch B).30 Patch A corresponds primarily to contacts with the third receptor CRD and patch B corresponds mostly to contacts with the second CRD. In all of the known TNF family ligand structures, the binding-site cleft is particularly shallow. However, in the case of BAFF, the presence of the unusually extended D-E loop results in the formation of a relatively deep, concave site in the lower part of the cleft (similar for all molecules in the asymmetric unit) that may constitute a component of the receptor binding site. This site corresponds to the patch B that was described above. The unusually deep cleft may be especially well

Blue represents positively charged regions and red represents negatively charged regions. The arrows originating from the BAFF-R sketch, point to the possible location of the BAFF-R binding site. The crossed-out red arrow indicates that BAFF-R does not bind to APRIL. The short vertical lines indicate the approximate orientation of the BAFF and APRIL 3fold axes.

suited to accommodate the very small size of two of the BAFF receptors, BCMA and BAFF-R. For instance, the cleft might allow for increased ligandreceptor interactions, compensating for the reduction of contacts due to the absence of a second CRD. The observed ¯exibility of the D-E loop may be a feature necessary for structural adaptation for receptor binding. Thus, it is possible that BCMA and BAFF-R bind to the cleft in a position analogous to that of the second CRD of TNFR. Calculation of the electrostatic potential shows that there is a predominance of negative charges on the surface of patch B (Figure 4). These charges are mostly localized on the ``rim'' of the cavity. The residues that are primarily responsible for these charges are Asp152, Asp222, Glu223, Glu254, Asp273 and Asp275. The remainder of the putative receptor binding site contains mostly neutral charges with the exception of a small positively charged area due to residue Arg231. This arginine residue is conserved in CD40L (Arg207), where it was found to be an important contributor to binding and speci®city.33 The observation of the negatively charged region of the BAFF cleft is of

1151 potential is associated with Arg195, a residue that is positioned in the middle of the binding site and is conserved in BAFF (Arg231). The presence of a large, positively charged region in the receptor binding site of APRIL is consistent with the fact that BAFF-R does not interact with APRIL.10 Furthermore, examination of BCMA and TACI sequences indicates that these molecules contain mixed electrostatic charges, which is consistent with the fact that these molecules bind to both BAFF and APRIL. Therefore, the above considerations suggest that predictions of speci®city between different TNF family ligands and receptors based on electrostatic complementarities may be feasible in cases where suf®cient structural information is available.

particular interest because the BAFF-R receptor appears to be a protein with an unusually large number of positively charged residues, most of which are located close to the N terminus.10 The apparent presence of electrostatic complementarity suggests that the binding energy of BAFFR-BAFF association may have a signi®cant electrostatic component. Arg231 of BAFF is positioned between patches A and B and makes contacts with the carbohydrate that is attached to residue Asn242. The carbohydrate of BAFF appears to occupy part of the putative receptor binding site, near patch A. The carbohydrate would be in steric con¯ict with a bound receptor having the size and shape of TNFR unless it adopts a limited set of conformations. There is no evidence that the carbohydrate occludes receptor binding, since experiments indicate that BAFF is fully active.10 Homology model of APRIL It is generally accepted that a sequence homology level of 30 % or higher is suf®cient for the generation of homology models with a signi®cant level of accuracy.34,35 We generated a homology model of the TNF-homologous domain of APRIL based on an automatic sequence alignment (sequence identity 34 %, Figure 3(a)) by using the crystal structure of BAFF as a template. Based on the degree of homology, the overall structures of APRIL and BAFF are predicted to be very similar. Differences in APRIL relative to BAFF include a six residue deletion in the D-E loop, a two residue insertion in the top of the E-F loop and a one residue deletion in the A-AHH loop of APRIL. The aromatic residues that are involved in the formation of the trimerization interface are conserved except for Phe194 of BAFF that becomes leucine in APRIL. The model shows no signi®cant steric con¯icts between the monomers of an APRIL trimer. The predicted shorter length of the D-E loop of APRIL is a signi®cant structural difference when compared to the BAFF structure. Importantly, as a consequence of the shorter loop size, the putative receptor binding site for APRIL is shallower. This difference in loop size and subsequent binding cleft depth may play a role in the binding speci®cities and af®nities of APRIL and BAFF for shared and ligand-speci®c receptors. Additional structural differences that may contribute to speci®city may be the variation of surface side-chains. Most of the predicted receptor binding-site residues of APRIL differ from those of BAFF except for those in a contiguous region that is located near patch A and consists mostly of residues of the E strand. Calculation of the electrostatic potential of the model of an APRIL trimer indicates that there is a predominance of positive charges on the putative receptor binding-site (Figure 4). This is in contrast to the predominance of negative charges in BAFF. The dominant feature of positive

Conclusions
In summary, the crystal structure of BAFF provides useful information, and predictions, about the structural characteristics of BAFF and APRIL, two related TNF family ligands, each with an important emerging biology. The information provides us with insights into the speci®city determinants of receptor binding, which can be further studied by mutagenesis experiments as well as the structure determination of BAFF in complex with its receptors.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification and crystallization Recombinant myc-hBAFF (residues Q136-L285 of BAFF with the myc sequence EQKLISEEDLNKEL attached to the N terminus) was cloned and expressed in yeast cells (Pichia pastoris). The protein was puri®ed by anion-exchange chromatography followed by gel®ltration. Brie¯y, Pichia supernatant was dialyzed and buffer-exchanged to 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mM NaCl, then loaded into a Q column and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (50 mM-500 mM). Further puri®cation of myc-hBAFF was achieved by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 (26/70) column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The puri®ed protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining, Western blot analysis using a mouse monoclonal 9E10 (anti-myc) antibody, and N-terminal sequencing. The protein was fully active as determined by different assays.10 For crystallization, the protein was concentrated to 9 mg/ml in PBS buffer (150 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 150 mM NaCl). Crystallization conditions were found using the crystallization screening kits from Hampton Research (Riverside, CA). Crystals of optimal size were grown by vapor diffusion at 4  C in hanging drops made by mixing 3 ml of protein solution with 3ml of reservoir solution of 8 % (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5). They are rod-shaped with hexagonal cross-section, have maximal dimensions 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 1 mm and grow within three to seven days.

Structure determination Crystals were cryoprotected by gradually equilibrating in a solution containing 25 % (v/v) ethylene glycol, 12 % (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and ¯ash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Native Xray diffraction data were collected at À175  C, up to Ê 3.3 A resolution on an R-axis IV detector system (Molecular Structure Corporation, Woodlands, TX) using CuKa radiation. The unit cell is hexagonal with cell Ê Ê dimensions a  b  122.12 A, c  157.55 A. Data processing with DENZO and SCALEPACK36 indicated that the space group is P61 or its enantiomorph P65. Ê The Matthews coef®cient37 was 3.05 A3 DaÀ1 with a solvent content of 59.41 % (v/v) (assuming a molecular mass of 18,500 Da), which indicated that there are two trimers of BAFF in the asymmetric unit. Data statistics are shown in Table 1. Attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe38 from the CCP4 program package39 using a variety of TNF-related structures as search probes were not successful. No obvious peaks corresponding to the 3-fold axes of the two BAFF trimers were observed in the self-rotation function, apparently due to a diffuse Patterson map, similar to the case of TNF-a.40 A search for heavyatom derivatives was undertaken and useful phase information was obtained from Hg, Pt, Ir and Sm derivatives by using the program SOLVE41 (Table 1). The resulting electron density map (®gure of merit 0.41) was improved considerably by density modi®cation with the program RESOLVE (®gure of merit 0.67).42 Inspection of maps revealed continuous density for the polypeptide chains and indicated that the correct space group was P65. A partial model of BAFF based on the CD40L structure25 was ®t manually onto the map and was rigid-body re®ned with XPLOR.43 The crystallographic R-factor after the rigid-body re®nement was 50.5 %. The ®tted model was used to calculate non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators. Phases calculated from the model were combined with experimental phases with SIGMAA from the CCP4 package39 and were improved by solvent¯attening, histogram-matching and 6-fold averaging with the program DM from the CCP4 package.39 Both the RESOLVE and DM maps as well as 2Fo À Fc maps were used for iterative model building with the graphics program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA.). All subsequent re®nement steps were carried out using the program CNX (44 and Molecular Simulations, Inc.). These included maximum-likelihood positional re®nement, torsion angle simulated annealing and grouped B-factor re®nement with NCS restraints: 10 % of the data were allocated for calculation of Rfree. A bulk-solvent correction was employed after the complete model was built. Simulated annealing omit maps were used to check validity of the model. NCS restraints were removed for certain regions of the molecule at the later stages of re®nement. After several re®nement cycles, the Rwork and Rfree factors of the model were 22.6 % and 26.8 %, respectively, for Ê the data (F > 2s) in the 35-3.3 A resolution range.

Additional data statistics are in Table 1. Model building of APRIL A sequence alignment of APRIL and BAFF TNFhomologous domain sequences was generated with the program QUANTA and re®ned manually (Figure 3(a)). The alignment and the crystal structure of BAFF were used for the generation of a homology model of APRIL (residues 114-250) with the program MODELER.46 This is an automated program that used spatial restraints such as inter-Ca distances and dihedral angles from the BAFF structure and generated the model by minimizing the violations of the restraints. A trimer of APRIL was generated from the monomer by applying the same transformations that relate the three BAFF monomers. Protein Data Bank accession number Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with ID code 1KD7.
