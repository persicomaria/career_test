Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, P.O. Box 100245, 1600 SW Archer Road, Gainesville, Florida 32610-0245 Received May 31, 2000 Two chimeric enzymes were constructed by exchanging domains between porcine pepsinogen and rhizopuspepsinogen in order to examine the contributions of the subsites present on different domains toward enzymatic specificity. Both chimeras exhibited the characteristic features of aspartic proteinases, such as auto-activation at low pH and abrogation of enzymatic activity by pepstatin. The activity of the chimera containing the N-terminal domain of rhizopuspepsinogen and the C-terminal domain of porcine pepsinogen (rhzNppC) could be observed by HPLC after prolonged incubation with the substrates. In contrast, the reciprocal chimera, ppNrhzC, containing the N-terminal domain of porcine pepsinogen and the C-terminal domain of rhizopuspepsinogen exhibited catalytic activity, measurable by a spectrophotometric assay. Kinetic data and inhibitor analyses strongly suggest that interdependency may exist between adjacent subsites contributed by different domains. Therefore, in order to develop an optimal substrate or inhibitor, the effect of adjacent residues of the ligand has to be examined along with the preferences for each subsite. 2000 Academic Press

INTRODUCTION Aspartic proteinases are characterized by a high degree of sequence and structural similarity (1). Most eukaryotic aspartic proteinases are synthesized as a single polypeptide containing a propeptide segment of about 40­50 amino acids that precedes the N-terminal domain. The propeptide of the zymogen is removed by auto-activation at low pH to yield mature active enzyme (2). The enzymes belonging to this family share some common characteristics such as pH optima in the acid range and inhibition by pepstatin, a hexapeptide from Streptomyces (3). Crystallographic data have been obtained for inhibitor complexes with various aspartic proteinases such as porcine pepsin (4­6), rhizopuspepsin (7), and cathepsin D (8). The structure is composed

almost entirely of -sheets with very few -helical segments (Fig. 1). The bilobal structure is composed of the N- and C-terminal domains and has a pseudo twofold axis of symmetry. The conformational homology of the two lobes has been suggested to be a result of gene duplication and fusion during the evolution of aspartic proteinases (9). ° The active site of the aspartic proteinases is a large cleft about 40 A in length present between the two domains. At the base of the cleft are the two catalytic aspartate residues, one contributed from each domain (Fig. 1), that are held in opposing orientation by an elaborate network of hydrogen bonds. The exact mechanism of catalysis in aspartic proteinases has not been elucidated (10). It is generally accepted that the hydrolytic reaction proceeds via a noncovalent tetrahedral intermediate, since no such intermediate has yet been isolated (11). The structures all indicate that the ligands bind to the active site in an extended strand conformation (Fig. 2). The amino acid residues of the ligand are labeled P5 ­P3 , with P1 and P1 being on either side of the scissile bond (12). The side chains of the residues span into alternating subsites, S5 ­S3 , which form the active site cleft. The S5, S3, S1, and S2 subsites are contributed by the N-terminal domain of the enzyme

The junction between the N-terminal domain (blue) and the C-terminal domain (violet) contains Ser172 and Thr173. The propeptide of the zymogen is indicated in yellow.

FIG. 2. Close-up view of the substrate bound in the active site cleft between the two domains of an aspartic proteinase. The side chains of the residues present in the P3, P1, and P2 positions of the ligand interact with the S3, S1, and S2 subsites contributed by the N-terminal domain (red surface). The S1 subsite is located underneath the "flap" region. The C-terminal domain (white surface) includes the S4, S2, S1 , and S3 subsites which interact with the residues at P4, P2, P1 , and P3 positions of the peptide.

while the C-terminal domain includes S4, S2, S1 , and S3 subsites (Fig. 2). The subtle differences in the catalytic specificity among the structurally homologous aspartic proteinases arise from the interaction of the side chains of the ligand and the solventexposed amino acids that define the active site cleft. Chimeric enzymes constructed by exchanging domains between different proteinases can be utilized in order to examine interdependency between subsites present on either domain. Earlier studies have indicated that the two domains of porcine pepsinogen can independently refold and could be converted to active two-chain pepsin at low pH (13). Domain rearrangement of pepsinogen has been carried out (14) based on the three-dimensional structure (15). A viable zymogen with drastically altered activation properties was obtained. Since active two-chain enzyme could be obtained after the complete removal of the propeptide from domain-rearranged pepsinogen, this study further substantiated the earlier observation that the two domains have the innate capability to fold independently. This study describes the characterization of two chimeric proteinases constructed by switching domains between porcine pepsin and rhizopuspepsin. Both of the parent enzymes exhibit broad specificity and efficiently cleave a wide variety of substrates

(16,17). Using data from crystallographic studies and protein engineering techniques, the junction between the two domains was designed to be present on a surface loop that was distant from the active site. The kinetic characterization of the chimeric enzymes was performed using chromogenic octapeptide substrates as well as inhibitors. The data obtained were compared to those obtained with the parent enzymes to examine the contributions of the domains toward the catalytic specificity of aspartic proteinases. MATERIALS AND METHODS The expression vector pET3d (18) containing the wild-type porcine pepsinogen gene and the vector pET3a containing the wild-type rhizopuspepsinogen gene were kindly provided by Chetana Rao (16) and Todd Lowther (17). Enzymes used in molecular biology were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersberg, MD), or were synthesized by the UF-ICBR DNA Synthesis Core Facility using an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA synthesizer. All other reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Chromogenic octapeptides were synthesized using the solid phase method at the UF-ICBR Protein Chemistry Core Facility using an AB430 amino acid or 432A Peptide Synthesizer. Purity of the peptides was determined to be 90% by reversed-phase HPLC. Stock solutions of the peptides and inhibitors were quantified by amino acid analysis on a Beckman System 6300 High Performance Analyzer following acid hydrolysis. Construction of chimeric aspartic proteinases. The chimeric gene encoding the Nterminal domain of porcine pepsinogen and the C-terminal domain of rhizopuspepsinogen was constructed after amplification of the respective segments of the genes by the polymerase chain reaction (Table 1). In each case, one of the primers was designed to contain a unique site for the restriction enzyme SpeI. The recognition sequence of SpeI, ACTAGT, codes for serine and threonine. These hydrophilic amino acids, which would be present on a surface loop, at the junction between the two domains, would be unlikely to cause perturbation

a Strand ( / ) is designated for each pair of primers designed to amplify the respective segments of the genes encoding the domains (N or C) of pepsinogen (pp) or rhizopuspepsinogen (rhz). One of the primers in each pair contained an engineered SpeI site (underlined).

of the structure in the chimeric enzyme. In addition, the unique SpeI site would facilitate screening of positive clones after ligation. The reciprocal chimera was constructed by a similar strategy, utilizing the unique SpeI site in the design of the primers that amplified the respective portions of the genes coding for the N-terminal domain of rhizopuspepsinogen and C-terminal domain of porcine pepsinogen. Gene amplification. The amplification reactions for the construction of chimeric genes were carried out with 100 pmol of primers, 10 ng of template DNA, and 5 units of Taq polymerase. The polymerase chain reaction was carried out in a Gene Machine II Programmable Thermal Controller (USA/Scientific Plastics). For the generation of both chimeras, 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 C (50 s), followed by annealing for 40 s at the optimal annealing temperature for each primer pair and an extension 72 C for 1 min was used. Restriction digest and ligation. The PCR products were purified by gel electrophoresis and digested with SpeI (3 u). The DNA fragments encoding the N-terminal domain of pepsinogen and the C-terminal domain of rhizopuspepsinogen, with compatible SpeI overhangs were ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Transformation was carried out using One Shot competent INV F E. coli cells (Invitrogen). After screening for positive clones, the chimeric gene for ppNrhzC was excised from the vector using XbaI (20 u) and PvuI (5 u). The restriction enzymes used in the case of the second chimeric gene, rhzNppC, were XbaI (20 u) and HindIII (20 u). The DNA was then purified and the chimeric gene in each case was ligated into the expression vector pET3d, which had been appropriately treated so that it had compatible overhangs. Transformation of the ligation reaction into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) was performed. Positive clones were verified by restriction digests as well as DNA sequencing. Protein expression. Luria Broth media containing ampicillin (50 g/L) was inoculated and incubated at 37 C until an OD600 of 0.5 was obtained. IPTG (0.5 mM) was added to induce protein expression. The cells were harvested after 3 h. Isolation of inclusion bodies. The cell pellet was resuspended in TN buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). DNase (Sigma) was then added (80 units/ml). The cell suspension was lysed by passaging twice through the French pressure cell. The cell lysate was layered over 27% sucrose cushion and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in TN buffer containing 1% of Triton X-100. After centrifuging as before, the pellet containing chimeric protein in the form of inclusion bodies was recovered. Samples were removed at each stage for analysis by SDS­ PAGE. Solubilization of inclusion bodies and refolding. The purified inclusion bodies were solubilized in freshly deionized 8 M urea solution containing 50 mM CAPS, pH 10.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM glycine, 500 mM NaCl, and 300 mM -mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of about 1 mg/ml. Dialysis was carried out against 10 times the original volume of Tris (50 mM / pH 11) for 2 h at room temperature. The dialysis was continued overnight with Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) at 4 C. Further dialysis was continued with a buffer containing 20 mM MES and 150 mM NaCl (pH 6) at 4 C for the chimeric enzyme, ppNrhzC. The second chimera, rhzNppC, was refolded using the same procedure except for the final step, which was carried out using 50 mM MES buffer containing 150 mM NaCl (pH 6) at 4 C.

Purification of chimeric proteins. The chimeric protein, ppNrhzC, was purified by gel filtration chromatography using Superdex G75 (16/60; Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). The enzyme was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with 20 mM MES and 150 mM NaCl (pH 6). Ion exchange chromatography with DEAE­Sepharose column (16/ 30; Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) was used to purify the second chimera, rhzCppN. The enzyme was eluted using a 20% gradient of 50 mM MES, pH 6.0, with 2 M NaCl over 15 min (flow rate 1 ml/min). Structural studies. The CD spectra were obtained with a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter, equipped with an IF-500 II computer interface, using a cell with a pathlength of 0.1 cm. The polarimeter was standardized with D( )-camphorsulphonic acid (19). The purified chimeric protein obtained by gel filtration was concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon apparatus. This was followed by dialysis against 100-fold volume of 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6) for 2 h. The CD spectra were recorded in the far-UV region (170­250 nm), where sodium phosphate has no absorbance. The purified parent enzymes, porcine pepsinogen and rhizopuspepsinogen, were dialyzed against 100-fold volume of 10 mM monobasic sodium phosphate (pH 7) for 2 h. All the samples were centrifuged prior to loading into the spectropolarimeter for analysis. The protein concentration of the chimera and the parent enzymes was then determined as 0.08 and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. The mean residue ellipticity, [ ]MRW, was calculated from the following equation: [ ]MRW ( 100 MRW)/(c d ),

where is the measured ellipticity in degrees, MRW is the mean residue weight, c is the protein concentration in mg/ml, and d is the path length in cm (20). The mean residue weight was calculated from the ratio of the molecular weight to the total number of amino acids present in the protein. N-terminal sequencing. The N-terminal sequences of the zymogen and activated chimera were determined to confirm the extent of processing. The proteins were subjected to SDS­PAGE and then electroblotted onto Immobilon-P PVDF transfer membranes (Millipore), in 10 mM MES pH 6.0 and 20% methanol, at 4 C. The samples were submitted to the University of Florida Protein Chemistry Core for Nterminal sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 470A protein sequencer. HPLC analysis. The sample containing the chimeric protein, rhzNppC, was incubated at room temperature overnight with octapeptide substrate in 0.1 M sodium formate, at the optimal pH for activity (3.8), and analyzed by HPLC. The peptide ° fragments that eluted from a C18 column (internal diameter 200 A) using a gradient of 5 to 30% acetonitrile in water (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), over 32 min at 214 nm, were monitored. Control samples that contained the peptide incubated alone or in the presence of either the parent enzymes or the inhibitor, pepstatin, were also analyzed by HPLC. Kinetic analysis. For the chimera, ppNrhzC, kinetic studies were performed on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer (21,22), using chromogenic substrates based on the sequence Lys-Pro-Ala-Lys-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu with systematic substitutions in different positions. A second series of peptides based on the sequence Lys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu was also examined. Stock solutions of the peptides

were made in 10% formic acid in water and quantitated by amino acid analysis using a Beckman System 6300 High Performance Amino Acid Analyzer in the University of Florida Protein Core facility. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored by the average decrease in absorbance over a range from 284 to 324 nm. All the assays were carried out after incubating the chimeric enzyme for 3 min at 37 C in 0.1 M formate buffer at optimal pH, 3.0. The Km and Vmax values were determined from the initial rates of at least six different concentrations of the substrates using Marquardt analysis (23) and the equa[S], where v is the rate of the reaction (s 1), Vmax is the tion v Vmax[S]/Km 1 maximum velocity (s ), [S] is the specific concentration of the substrate (Molar), and Km is the substrate concentration at half the maximum velocity (Molar). To verify that the chimeras cleaved between the Phe and Nph residues, similar to that of the parent enzymes, the products were separated by HPLC and identified by amino acid analysis. Active site titration and kcat. A stock solution of the potent inhibitor pepstatin A (Sigma) was made in DMSO and quantified by amino acid analysis. Inhibitor dilutions were made with distilled water. The amount of active enzyme was determined by competitive titration with Pepstatin A, at one substrate concentration. The Henderson equation for tight binding inhibitors was used to fit the resulting curve, using the Enzfitter program (24,25). The values for kcat were determined from the equation kcat Vmax/( A/[S])[E ],

where A is the total change in absorbance obtained with a specific concentration of the substrate [S] (Molar) and [E ] is the active enzyme concentration (Molar). The standard deviations of the kcat and kcat/Km were propagated using equations derived by standard procedures for independent errors as outlined by Meyer (26). Assays using competitive inhibitors. The inhibition constant, Ki, was determined by monitoring the competitive inhibition of the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate Lys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu. The reactions were carried out in 0.1 M sodium formate buffer, pH 3.0, at 37 C. The DMSO concentrations were kept below 2% in these assays. The initial rates of at least six different substrate concentrations were measured following a 3-min incubation without inhibitor. Initial rates were then obtained after preincubation with two different concentrations of the inhibitor, and using at least three different substrate concentrations. The inhibition constant Ki was determined from all the curves using the equation v Vmax [S]/Km(1 [I ]/Ki) [S],

where v is the rate of the reaction (s 1), Vmax is the maximum velocity (s 1), and [S] is the specific concentration of the substrate (Molar). Km is the substrate concentration at half the maximum velocity (Molar) and [I ] is the inhibitor concentration (Molar). If the Ki value determined by this method was one nanomolar or lower, a competitive titration was performed as described for the enzyme titration. Calculation of free energy of binding. In order to examine the interaction of adjacent

CHIMERIC ASPARTIC PROTEINASES

subsites present on different domains, the changes in free energy of binding of peptides with either a single(a or b) or double substitution(ab) in the P2 and P3 position of the parent peptide(p) KPIEF*NphRL was determined. The relative binding to the transition state was calculated using the equation GT RT ln[kcat/Km (a or b, ab)/kcat/Km (p, a or b)],

where the specificity constants are denoted by kcat/Km (27­30). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Expression, Refolding, and Purification of Chimeric Enzymes The bacterial expression system used to express the parent enzymes, pepsinogen and rhizopuspepsinogen, was also utilized for the expression of the chimeric aspartic proteinases. The yield and purity of the inclusion bodies obtained by the overexpression of chimeric proteins was comparable with that of the parent enzymes. Consequently, the largest losses of protein occurred during the solubilization and refolding. The presence of the disulfide bridges in the chimeras complicates the process of refolding. In the case of the chimera ppNrhzC, there are two disulfide bridges, one in each domain (C45­C50 and C249­282). An additional disulfide bridge is present in the C-terminal domain of the second chimera (C249­C282). In order to reduce the cysteine residues in the protein before refolding, high levels (10- to 1000-fold molar excess based on cysteines) of the reducing agent -mercaptoethanol were utilized. A number of methods were attempted in order to overcome the problem of precipitation in the refolding of the first chimera, ppNrhzC. These included changes in a variety of parameters in dialysis such as protein concentration, pH, temperature, and time. To minimize aggregation, refolding of the chimeric enzyme was carried out using buffers containing detergents such as Tween 20 or 0.1% SDS. Dialysis with buffers containing reshuffling agents (reduced/oxidized glutathione), in the presence and absence of 0.1 M L-arginine (31), were also performed in order to maximize yields of correctly folded protein. The technique of refolding by rapid dilution was also attempted to overcome aggregation of chimeric protein (14). In an effort to enhance recovery of active protein, rapid dilution in the presence of reshuffling agents was also examined (32). Aggregation/precipitation remained a constant factor in all these methods. It was determined that, among the different conditions examined for the refolding of the chimeric aspartic proteinase ppNrhzC, the best results were obtained when the inclusion bodies were solubilized for 2 h at room temperature before dialysis. In addition, the final step in the dialysis had to be carried out at a pH of 6.0 with an additional buffer change. Purification of chimera ppNrhzC was carried out by gel filtration chromatography after dialysis. The majority of the protein eluted in the void volume, indicating incorrectly folded protein. However, a small quantity of chimeric protein ( 1%) eluted in the region where a correctly folded monomeric protein of 40 kDa would be expected and enzymatic activity was observed in these fractions at low pH, using chromogenic substrates in the spectrophotometric assay. The second chimera, rhzNppC, was purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a DEAE­Sepharose

column (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). The fractions in the major peak that eluted at a concentration of 0.4 M NaCl cleaved octapeptide substrates after overnight incubation at low pH and were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 3). Processing of the propeptide by autoactivation at low pH was verified by SDS­ PAGE and N-terminal sequencing for both chimeras. Attempts made to purify mature enzyme in both cases, using ion exchange and gel filtration, did not yield active protein. Although the zymogen of the second chimera, rhzNppC, could be completely autoactivated to yield mature enzyme, enzymatic activity could not be observed by spectrophotometric assays even under varying conditions of time, temperature, and pH. Prolonged incubation at low pH (room temperature) was necessary to detect cleavage of the substrate, which was determined by HPLC. This chimeric enzyme exhibited a primary specificity for hydrophobic as well as positively charged residues

in the P1 position of the peptide, similar to that of rhizopuspepsin (Fig. 3). This ability to cleave substrates containing P1 lysine is seen only in fungal aspartic proteinases. Site-directed mutagenesis (16) has shown this unique specificity is due to an aspartate at position 77, present in the flap region of the N-terminal domain that extends over the active site (Fig. 2). The negatively charged group of this aspartate residue can interact with the positively charged lysine residue present in the P1 position and consequently, the substrate is cleaved. Porcine pepsin has a threonine at the equivalent position and hence does not cleave this substrate. The results of this HPLC analysis therefore suggest that the flap region, in the N-terminal domain, of rhzNppC is oriented over the active site cleft in a similar manner to rhizopuspepsin. However, activation of this enzyme was slow and the substrate was cleaved only after prolonged incubation. It is possible that the carboxyl groups of the active site aspartates may not be in the correct orientation in this chimera, therefore resulting in slow emergence of activity. Although the region around the active site of pepsin and the fungal enzymes are largely conserved, crystallographic studies of porcine pepsin suggest that the carboxyl group of Asp215, present in the C-terminal domain, is oriented slightly differently compared to rhizopuspepsin (4). In addition, the largest structural differences between pepsin and the fungal enzymes were found to occur in the C-terminal domain. Within this region, a flexible subdomain (residues 223­299) is present, which may mediate substrate binding. The movement of this subdomain may be limited in the chimera, rhzNppC, and this may contribute toward the slow activity observed. Since this is a region of low sequence similarity, site-directed mutagenesis or cassette mutagenesis may be carried out to elucidate the role of this subdomain in substrate binding. Structural Studies The chimeric protein, ppNrhzC, that eluted in the expected region during gel filtration and which could be activated at low pH, was analyzed by circular dichroism (CD). The far UV region (200­250 nm), used for the CD measurements, contains information about the secondary structure of the protein. The monomeric chimera exhibited a CD profile resembling that of the parent enzymes; however, the amount of secondary structure present was less than was observed for porcine pepsinogen and rhizopuspepsinogen (Fig. 4). However, this chimera was active at low pH and kinetic data indicated that each domain of the enzyme refolds to generate subsites present in the relevant parent enzyme. This suggests that the conserved region around the active site is present in the chimera, but other regions distant to the active site may not be folded correctly. It should be noted that although the two domains of porcine pepsinogen have been shown to refold independently, this has not been demonstrated for rhizopuspepsinogen. Hence, it is possible that the C-terminal domain of the chimera, which is identical to that of rhizopuspepsinogen, may be partially unfolded, resulting in an active enzyme that has less secondary structure than either parent enzyme. In contrast, the sample containing the fractions of ppNrhzC that eluted in the void volume during gel filtration did not have significant secondary structure when examined by circular dichroism. Enzymatic activity was not observed even on prolonged incubation at low pH.

Kinetic Analysis Both the chimeric enzymes exhibit the typical features of aspartic proteinases, such as auto-activation at low pH and inhibition by pepstatin. Although the recovery of purified enzyme was low for the first chimera, ppNrhzC, the enzyme was observed to cleave a wide variety of chromogenic substrates efficiently at low pH, a result also found with the parent enzymes. This indicates that the two domains from different aspartic proteinases could fold, at least in the presence of substrates, to form the extended active site cleft that is typical of aspartic proteinase. Kinetic data were obtained for the chimeric aspartic proteinase, ppNrhzC, using two different series of chromogenic octapeptides. Since the primary specificity of aspartic proteinases is for bulky aromatic residues on either side of the scissile bond, these substrates had phenylalanine and nitrophenylalanine, in the P1 and P1 positions, respectively. Systematic substitutions were made at positions P5 ­P2 and P2 in the two series of substrates in order to explore the potential hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding interactions that may occur in the individual binding pockets. The results of the kinetic analysis of the chimera were compared with the data obtained for the parent enzymes in order to determine the contributions of the subsites present in each domain toward enzymatic specificity. The overall catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km value) of the chimera ppNrhzC was observed to be much lower than the parent enzymes. The second series of peptides, based on

the sequence Lys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu, were more efficiently cleaved by the chimera. P5 position. Porcine pepsin favored lysine as well as leucine residue in this position, in the Lys-Pro-Ala-Lys-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu-based series, with a specificity constant about 0.7 M 1 s 1, while the hydrophilic serine was the least tolerated with a kcat/ Km value of 0.2 M 1 s 1 (Fig. 5). The residue in the P5 position interacts with the S5 subsite, which originates from porcine pepsin in the chimera. The most favored residues in this position were leucine and lysine in the chimera similar to porcine pepsin, while the serine substituted peptide was cleaved with twofold less efficiency. In contrast, this substrate was cleaved efficiently by rhizopuspepsin with a specificity constant of 1.2 M 1 s 1. The peptide containing arginine in the P5 position was the most favored in rhizopuspepsin (kcat/Km 1.74 M 1 s 1). P4 position. The residue in the P4 position interacts with the S4 subsite in the C-terminal domain. In the case of the chimera, this domain is identical to that of

Residues at P5, P3, and P2 positions interact with subsites in the N-terminal domain while those at P4 and P2 positions interact with the C-terminal domain. The kcat/Km values obtained for ppNrhzC (dotted bars) porcine pepsin (dark bars), and rhizopuspepsin (gray bars) are shown. In order to examine the preferences of the chimera, ppNrhzC, the low specificity constants were increased five-fold.

rhizopuspepsin. The most favored residue in the Lys-Pro-Ala-Lys-Phe*Nph-ArgLeu-based series was the leucine-containing peptide for both the chimera and rhizopuspepsin followed by the proline substituted peptide as shown in Table 2. The arginine substitution was the least tolerated for both enzymes as well as porcine pepsin. This may arise from electrostatic repulsion between the lysine in P2 and the arginine residue in P4 position of the substrate, since the S2 and the S4 subsites are adjacent to each other (Fig. 2). Porcine pepsin clearly favored proline of the parent peptide in this position. The proline residue may help in restricting the conformation of the peptide and thereby align it in the active site cleft, facilitating cleavage. In the second library of peptides examined, based on the sequence Lys-Pro-IleGlu-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu, the proline containing substrate was the most favored for all three enzymes as shown in Table 2. P3 position. The side chains of the amino acid present in this position interact with the residues in the S3 subsite. The N-terminal domain contributes this subsite, which is identical in porcine pepsin and the chimera. The hydrophobic nature of the S3 subsite facilitates binding of the hydrophobic residues such as alanine and leucine and isoleucine for the parent enzymes as well as the chimera. The arginine-containing substrate was cleaved poorly by the chimera and pepsin in contrast to rhizopuspepsin for both series of peptides examined (Table 2 and Fig. 5). It has been demonstrated that upon increasing the pH of the assay, the peptide with arginine in the P3 position can be cleaved by porcine pepsin. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that this titratable response is due to the Glu13 residue present in the S3 subsite of porcine pepsin (16). Under standard assay conditions for porcine pepsin (pH 3.5), this residue is hydrophobic due to the methylene groups in the side chain. Upon raising the pH, deprotonation occurs and Glu13 residue can be involved in specific electrostatic interactions. Since the chimera had a narrow range of activity (pH 2.5­3.5), this titratable effect could not be examined. P2 position. Porcine pepsin shows a broad tolerance for various residues in this position for both series of peptides examined (Table 2 and Fig. 5). In the case of rhizopuspepsin and the chimera, which contain similar S2 subsites, peptides containing the hydrophobic residues such as alanine or leucine in the P2 position in the series based on Lys-Pro-Ala-Lys-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu are clearly the preferred substrates (Fig. 5). The peptide containing alanine in the P2 position was in fact the best in the series for the chimera (kcat/Km 0.278 M 1 s 1) and rhizopuspepsin (kcat/Km 2.39 M 1 s 1). However, in the second series of peptides shown in Table 2, the parent peptide containing glutamate in the P2 position was the most favored for the chimeric enzyme (kcat/Km 0.7 M 1 s 1) as well as rhizopuspepsin (kcat/Km 2.7 M 1 s 1). Alanine was accommodated in this position with less efficiency in the case of the chimera (kcat/Km 0.1 M 1 s 1) and rhizopuspepsin (kcat/Km 0.4 M 1 s 1). The substrate containing leucine in the P2 position was cleaved with low efficiency in the chimera with a specificity constant of 0.05 M 1 s 1 and was the least tolerated substitution 0.04 M 1 s 1). In both cases, the low in the case of rhizopuspepsin (kcat/Km specificity constant was primarily due to a low kcat value. P2 position. The residue in this position interacts with the S2 subsite which is created primarily by residues that lie on the underside of the flap region. This subsite originates from N-terminal domain, which is identical to pepsin in the case of ppNrhzC.

Both enzymes favored the hydrophobic leucine residue in the P2 position, in the first series of peptides examined, as seen in Fig. 5. The smaller alanine residue was the preferred amino acid in this position for rhizopuspepsin. The negatively charged aspartate was the least tolerated in this position for all three enzymes. The S2 subsite contains the conserved Tyr75 residue. The hydrophobic alanine and leucine residues can therefore be accommodated in the P2 position. Arginine may be tolerated because of its flexibility and length, as it is possible that the side chain of arginine extends beyond Tyr75 into the solvent. In general, the trends in the specificity constants of the chimera obtained for the different residues at various positions of the octapeptide substrates reflected the preferences seen in the parent enzymes for the respective subsites. This suggests that the domains of the chimera fold to generate the subsites present in relevant parent enzyme. The best substrate for the chimera was found to be the parent peptide of the second series Lys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu with a specificity constant of 0.7 M 1 s 1. In this series, the peptide with the alanine substitution in the P3 position 2.86 M 1 s 1) was found to be the best substrate for rhizopuspepsin (kcat/Km while the most efficiently cleaved substrate of porcine pepsin contained alanine in the P2 position. All the peptides examined in this series were good substrates for pepsin and the chimera with the sole exception of the one containing P3 arginine. In the case of rhizopuspepsin, it was observed that, except for the P2 position, the other substituents examined in this series were well accommodated. The specificity constants were lower for P2 derivatives when compared to the identical substitutions in the series based on the sequence Lys-Pro-Ala-Lys-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu. This was mainly due to decreased kcat values. A drastic decrease of 45-fold was seen in the case of the peptide containing leucine in the P2 position, while the alanine substituent showed a 6-fold decrease in kcat values. In the case of the chimera, this decrease was 4- and 2-fold, respectively. This difference may arise from the replacement of the alanine in the P3 position of the peptide series, with the larger isoleucine in the second series of substrates. Inhibitor Analysis Inhibitor studies were also carried out with the chimeric and parent aspartic proteinases to complement the analysis with the substrates (Table 3). The first inhibitor (1) shown is pepstatin (Iva-Val-Val-Sta-Abu-Sta), the universal inhibitor of aspartic proteinases. The values of Ki for pepstatin were in the subnanomolar range, indicating efficient binding of the inhibitor for the chimera as well as pepsin and rhizopuspepsin. The next two inhibitors are also statine-based derivatives (statine: 3-hydroxy 4-amino 6-methyl heptanoic acid). These are excellent inhibitors of porcine pepsin as indicated by the subnanomolar value obtained for the Ki in both cases. While one of these, Ac-NA-Val-Sta-Abu-NA-amide (2), inhibited ppNrhzC and rhizopuspepsinogen in the low nanomolar range, the other inhibitor, Ac-NA-Nva-Sta-NvaNA-amide (3), exhibited a 100-fold difference in the inhibition constants for the chimera and rhizopuspepsin compared to pepsin. The statine moiety occupies the S1 and S1 subsites in both these cases. Inhibitor 3 differs from inhibitor 2 in having the longer norvaline residue replace valine and aminobutyryl in the P2 and P2 positions, respectively. The binding of inhibitor 3 is decreased to a similar extent in the chimera

and rhizopuspepsin. Since both these enzymes have the same C-terminal domain, this effect can be attributed to the change in the P2 residue of this inhibitor, which interacts with the S2 subsite in the C-terminal domain, rather than the P2 residue which binds to the S2 subsite in the N-terminal domain. Inhibitors 4 and 5 were designed to contain lysine in the P1 position. Fungal enzymes have a unique ability among aspartic proteinases to cleave substrates with lysine in the P1 position. Site-directed mutagenesis in rhizopuspepsin has shown this is due to Asp77 present in the flap region (17). The inhibition constants obtained for these two inhibitors were in the 100­200 nM range for rhizopuspepsin, in contrast to pepsin and the chimera which were not inhibited even at concentrations of 1 M. Inhibitor (6) is the recombinant form of the protease inhibitor PI-3 secreted by the intestinal parasitic nematode Ascaris suum. The naturally occurring inhibitor and the recombinant PI-3 (rPI-3) have been shown to be potent and selective inhibitors of porcine pepsin (33,34). The structure of this protein inhibitor in complex with porcine pepsin has been reported (35). The activity of the fungal aspartic proteinase, rhizopuspepsin, was inhibited by only about 25% at 1 M of the inhibitor. It was interesting to note that the inhibition constant measured for the chimeric enzyme was different from both parent enzymes by a factor of 100-fold. As the chimera has one domain from pepsin and one domain from rhizopuspepsin, the intermediate inhibition constant suggests that both domains contribute to the interaction in the case of pepsin. This is exactly what was observed in the three-dimensional structure of the complex solved by x-ray methods. Changes in Free Energy of Binding In order to examine these interactions between the S3 and S2 subsites, the changes in Gibb's free energy between the parent peptide and the substrates with substitutions in the P3 or P2 positions were estimated utilizing specificity constants. The substrate Lys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu was selected as the parent peptide, since it was efficiently cleaved by all three enzymes (Table 2). The substrates containing the single substitution of either Ala in the P3 position or Leu in the P2 position of the parent peptide were examined in this analysis along with the peptide having both substitutions. The variation in free energy for the singly substituted peptides from the parent peptide Ga RT ln[(kcat/ was denoted by Ga or b and calculated (16,17,27­30) as Gb RT ln[(kcat/Km)b /(kcat/Km)p], where the specificity conKm)a /(kcat/Km)p] and stants are denoted by (kcat/Km)a or b for the singly substituted peptides while (kcat/Km)p is that obtained for the parent peptide (Table 2 and Fig. 5). Ga If the binding of substrates in the S3 and S2 subsites is independent, then Gb Gd (29), where Gc is the free energy change of the peptideab Gc and with substitutions both in the P2 and the P3 positions expressed as RT ln[(kcat/Km)ab / Gd is the free energy change of the same doubly substituted peptideab (kcat/Km)a], and expressed relative to the other singly substituted peptide as RTln[(kcat/Km)ab /(kcat/ Ga Gc and Gb Gd Km)b]. However, if there is interdependency, then and Ga Gd Gb Gc 0 (Fig. 6). This `nonadditivity' defines the coupling energy or the energy difference measured between the doubly substituted peptide and each of the singly substituted peptides determined separately (36). In the case of pepsin, the average loss in transition state stabilization free energy

FIG. 6. Analysis of the changes in free energy of transition state stabilization for the chimeric enzyme, ppNrhzC, and porcine pepsin and rhizhopuspepsin. The numbers above the peptides are the kcat/Km values ( M 1 s 1) obtained for each enzyme while the free energy values G (kcal mol 1) are indicated between the peptides (bold). For peptides containing a single substitution(a or b) either in the P2 or the P3 position of the parent peptidep (KPIEF*NphRL), the free energy change G(a or b) RT ln[(kcat/ Km)a or b/[(kcat/Km)p]. The effect of variation in both P2 and P3 positions of the doubly substituted peptideab was calculated as Gc RT ln[(kcat/Km)ab /[(kcat/Km)a] and Gd RT ln[(kcat/Km)ab /[(kcat/Km)b].

for the doubly substituted peptide containing alanine in the P3 and leucine in the P2 position is about 0.5 kcal mol 1. In contrast, this change in free energy for both rhizopuspepsin and the chimera is 2.4 and 1.6 kcal mol 1, respectively, for the same peptide, indicating significant interaction between the P3 and P2 residues. The data also indicate that, in the case of rhizopuspepsin and the chimera, the peptide with a branched leucine residue present in the P2 position can be cleaved more efficiently if the residue in the P3 position is alanine rather than the larger isoleucine. The differences in transition state energy were calculated to be 2.4 and 1.0 kcal mol 1, respectively. Analysis of free energy changes using peptides with substitutions in P2 and P3 positions of the substrate Lys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu (Fig. 6) suggests that the binding of the ligand in the S2 subsite of rhizopuspepsin is influenced by the size of the residue in the P3 position. It is possible that the presence of the large residue in the P3 position may lead to the distortion of the peptide backbone in such a way

that only smaller amino acid residues may be accommodated in the S2 subsite of rhizopuspepsin and therefore the chimera. Data from analysis of inhibitor binding (Table 3) indicate that the length of the side chain of the P2 residue may play a critical role in determining optimal binding in the active site cleft in the presence of a bulky residue in the P3 position in rhizopuspepsin and the chimera. It is interesting to note that this trans interaction was not observed in porcine pepsin. A detailed investigation of trans interactions in other subsites of these aspartic proteinases may likewise be carried out using a similar strategy with doubly substituted peptides. Thus, the effect of adjacent residues of the ligand can be examined along with the preferences for each subsite in order to develop an optimal substrate or inhibitor. The structure­function relationship in aspartic proteinases can also be further explored using inhibitors to aid in the interpretation of data. The design of a selective and potent inhibitor is crucial since aspartic proteinases, which are known to be involved in essential biological processes such as digestion, have been recently implicated in many diseases such as cancer and malaria.
