The binding of CD40L to CD40, which is expressed on the surface of B cells, provides a critical and unique pathway of cellular activation resulting in antibody isotype switching, regulation of apoptosis, and B cell proliferation and differentiation. Naturally occurring mutations of CD40L result in the clinical hyper-IgM syndrome, characterized by an inability to produce immunoglobulins of the IgG, IgA and IgE isotypes. Results: We have determined the crystal structure of a soluble extracellular fragment of human CD40L to 2 A resolution and with an R factor of 21.8%. Although the molecule forms a trimer similar to that found for other members of the TNF family, such as TNFat and lymphotoxin-a, and exhibits a similar overall fold, there are considerable differences in several loops including those predicted to be involved in CD40 binding. Conclusions: The structure suggests that most of the hyper-IgM syndrome mutations affect the folding and stability of the molecule rather than the CD40-binding site directly. Despite the fact that the hyper-IgM syndrome mutations are dispersed in the primary sequence, a large fraction of them are clustered in space in the vicinity of a surface loop, close to the predicted CD40-binding site.

Introduction
The immune system is an ensemble of many complex processes, many of which involve cell-cell communication. This process of communication is mediated by both secreted and cell-surface-expressed cytokine molecules. Binding of the cytokines on appropriate receptors of cells are events that direct cell behaviour. CD40 ligand (CD40L), also known as T-B activating molecule (TBAM), TNF-related activation protein (TRAP) or gp39, is a 33 kDa, type II membrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of activated CD4+ T cells which has been shown to mediate functional T and B cell interactions [1-5]. Binding of T cell CD40L to its cognate receptor, CD40, expressed on the surface of B cells has several effects, including activation of antibody isotype switching, prevention of B cell apoptosis to establish immunological memory, germinal center formation in lymph nodes, modulation of cytokine production in activated B cells and B cell proliferation and differentiation [6-10]. Several mutations of CD40L are known to cause a severe immunodeficiency, linked to the X chromosome, known as hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGMS), which is characterized by normal or elevated levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) M, but the absence or low levels of IgG, IgA and IgE in serum [11-16]. A murine CD40L gene 'knockout' also lacks expression of IgG, IgA and IgE similar to HIGMS in man [9,10]. These observations suggest that CD40 signaling is absolutely required for IgG, IgA and IgE production and that this function is

non-redundant with other signaling/adhesion pathways. Studies show that CD40L may play a role in certain diseases such as arthritis [17], lupus [18], Hodgkin's lymphoma [19] and viral infections [20]. Thus, it is apparent that interfering with the CD40L-CD40 interaction may have important therapeutic applications. Early studies [21-23] showed that CD40L is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of cytokines. Other members of this family include TNFot, lymphotoxin-oa (LTca) (also known as TNF3), LT,3, Fas ligand, CD30L, CD27L and 4-1BBL. Crystal structures are available for two members of this family, TNFoa [24,25] and LTao [26]. Both structures show that these molecules are homotrimers and that each monomer folds as a ,3 sheet sandwich of Greek key topology. Despite their relatively low sequence identity (30.6%), TNFa( and LT(x share a high degree of structural homology. CD40L is expected to consist of a 22-residue intracellular N-terminal domain, a short transmembrane segment, a relatively long, 65-residue extracellular 'stalk' and a globular TNFlike extracellular domain of about 150 residues at the C-terminal end. The TNF-like CD40L domain has only 24.7% sequence identity with LT and 27.3% identity with TNFa. It has been proposed that other members of this family share similar three-dimensional structures [27]. In addition, the crystal structure of the complex of LTa with its receptor,

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 10 TNFR-55, has been determined [28] and provides a framework for modeling the ligand-receptor interaction of other members of the TNF family. The complex consists of three elongated receptor molecules bound in the LTot intersubunit grooves. Each receptor molecule consists of four concatenated domains that in turn form separate folded units. Only the second and third TNFR domains contact LTa directly. It has been proposed that the binding of three receptors to one LTa molecule brings together the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors and results in signaling. In this report we describe the crystal structure of a functional soluble fragment of CD40L containing residues Glyll116-Leu261 of the extracellular domain. The structure of this fragment was determined at 2 A resolution by the method of molecular replacement. We also discuss insights that the structure provides into the CD40LCD40 interaction and the nature of hyper-IgM mutations. Results and discussion Description of the structure Almost all of residues of CD40L, except for residues 116-119 of the N terminus, are well defined in the final 2Fo-F c electron-density map (Fig. 1). There are areas of weak density for residues 182-186 and 210-220. The current model consists of 142 amino acid residues and 95 water molecules with a crystallographic R factor of 21.8% and an Rfree of 29.1% for data between 7.5 A and 2 A. The Ramachandran diagram shows that 140 out of the 142 amino acid residues have (q,) angles within the allowed regions. The exceptions are residues Cys218, which is involved in formation of a disulfide bridge, and Lysl43. CD40L folds as a sandwich of two [3 sheets with jellyroll or Greek key topology (Fig. 2). The dimensions of the molecule are 25 Ax30 Ax50 A. The overall fold is similar to that of TNFa and LTa (Fig. 3). In our description, the notation of [26] is used for the 3 strands sheet consists of and other structural features. One strands A"AHCF and the other of strands B'BGDE. To assess the degree of structural similarity between TNFa, LTot and CD40L, we aligned their sequences so as to maximize the overlap of equivalent -strand residues. The equivalent Ca atoms from the 3 strands were then used to superimpose the molecular structures. The root mean square (rms) positional deviation of 86 equivalent Ca atoms of superimposed TNFa and CD40L molecules is 1.10 A. In the case of the LTa/CD40L pair, the rms deviation for the 100 equivalent Ca atoms is 1.03 A. The positions of the residues are highly conserved in the core and 3-strand regions but differ significantly in certain loops, such as the AA", CD and EF loops. An alignment of the TNFa, LTa and CD40L sequences, based on the best structural superimpositions, is shown in Figure 4. Most residues of the hydrophobic core of CD40L maintain the identity or the character encountered in the equivalent residues of TNFa and LTa. There are local, compensatory, conformational changes to accommodate side-chain changes, such as the substitution of Leu33 of LTa to Val136 in CD40L which results in a shift of the side chain of Leul61 to fill the empty space. Three CD40L molecules form a trimer similar to that observed in the crystal structures of TNFa and LTa. The trimer has the shape of a truncated pyramid. The threefold axis of the trimer is approximately parallel to the [3 strands of each subunit. The interface between the subunits is formed mainly by two tyrosines, two histidines and one leucine. Thus, the 'aromatic tiling' observed in LTa is not as prevalent in CD40L. Tyrl70 and His224 from each monomer form an unusual cluster of two triads along the threefold axis of the trimer (Fig. lb). The crystal packing of CD40L trimers is displayed in Figure 5. Each CD40L monomer forms one crystal

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 10 contact that involves loops DE (residues 198-201), FG (232-233) and BC (164-166) from one molecule and loops CD (182-186), AA" (131-135) and GH (245-246) from the neighboring molecule. Sixteen water molecules are involved in the formation of the contact. The CD and EF loops of CD40L at the 'top' of the molecule are shorter than those of TNFot and LTot. However, despite its shorter length, the CD loop contains 1.5 turns of a helix in a similar manner to the equivalent loop in LTa. Also analogous to LToL, regions of poor electron density occur within these loops that may indicate disorder. In addition, a plot of the temperature factors (Fig. 6) suggests that the CD and EF loops are the most mobile parts of the molecule. The C and F strands are linked by a disulfide bridge between Cys178 and Cys218 that may play a role in stabilizing the top the molecule. A disulfide bridge is also present in TNFot but it is located at a different position. Although the AA" loop does not differ much between TNFca and LTa, in CD40L it has a very different structure: it is shifted away from the CD40-binding site relative to TNFet and LTa. The unusual conformation of the AA" loop may be related to its extensive participation in the crystal contact. A short 310-helical structure is found within the GH loop and a 3 bulge occurs in the middle of strand E. The N and C termini lie close to each other at the base of the trimer. Residues 116-119 of the N terminus of the construct are poorly defined in the electron-density map, therefore the first well ordered residue is Prol20. Residues 116-119 presumably constitute part of the stalk connecting the globular domain to the transmembrane segment. This 65-residue stalk is unusually long compared with the equivalent segments in other inembers of the TNF family. A single glycosylation site is predicted from analysis of the CD40L sequence. Biochemical experiments (data not shown) revealed that residue Asn240 of the CD40L protein used for the crystallization has an N-linked carbohydrate attached to it. A 2F -F c map shows electron density in the vicinity of the side chain of Asn240 which presumably corresponds to the attached carbohydrate. However, because the density is not well defined, the current model contains no carbohydrate atoms at this position. Binding site By analogy with the LTa-TNFR complex crystal structure, the CD40-binding site consists of a shallow groove formed between two monomers. The activation complex of CD40L-CD40 is expected to be similar to the LTot-TNFR complex. On the basis of the linkage diagram in [28], showing which residue of LTax interacts with which residue of TNFR, stretches of the CD40L sequence that are likely to constitute the binding site of CD40L can be inferred (Fig. 4). The binding site is expected to contain residues mostly from the AA" and DE loops. In addition, residues from the CD and GH loops and 3 strands C, D, G and H are expected to be involved in CD40 binding. Virtually no sequence conservation exists between CD40L and LTot or TNFot in these regions. Although Serl31 of the AA" loop appears to be conserved in the sequence alignment, the structural superimposition shows that it is relatively distant from the equivalent position (Ser38) in LTa. The Tyr145 side chain of the AA" loop of CD40L is disordered but is found in an equivalent position to Arg51 of LTa and, like Arg51 in the LTot-TNFR complex, may have an extended and well-defined conformation in the complex. On the DE loop, only Phe201 is conserved (equivalent to Phel 10 of LTa). Interestingly, Phe201 adopts a very similar conformation to that of Phel 10 in the LTa-TNFR complex, whereas in the uncomplexed LToL, PhellO10 adopts a quite different conformation. The Arg200 side chain in the DE loop is involved in a crystal contact. As mentioned earlier, the conformation of loops DE, AA" and GH is likely to be affected by the crystal contact thus it is expected that their structure will be different in the complex. The conformational changes associated with complex formation in the case of LTa, although minor, may be indicative of the magnitude of changes that occur upon CD40 binding to CD40L. A mixture of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues form the surface of the binding site. The LTot-TNFR binding interface can be considered as separate upper and lower regions [28]. In a similar manner to LTa, the

Residue number

Fig. 6. Graph of temperature factors of main-chain atoms as a function of residue number. upper region in CD40L has more hydrophobic and non-charged polar residues than the lower region. Arg207 seems to be a key residue, lying in the area where the upper and lower regions connect. The Arg207 side chain adopts an extended conformation pointing towards the putative location of the CD40 receptor and is surrounded by three surface-exposed hydrophobic residues and a serine residue (Ser192). Two of the hydrophobic residues (Ilel90 and Phe253) belong to the neighboring subunit, whereas Ile204 is from the same subunit. Murine CD40L has a lysine in the position equivalent to that of Arg207 of human CD40L and this lysine also seems likely to be surrounded by hydrophobic residues [22]. The hydrophobic environment of the arginine may amplify the strength of a possible electrostatic interaction between this residue and an acidic residue of CD40. Analysis of mutations Mutagenesis studies on CD40L have shown that residues Tyr145 and Lys143 are directly involved in CD40 binding [29]. The crystal structure shows that both residues lie on the AA" loop and are surface-exposed (Figs 7,8). The equivalent loop in the LTot-TNFR crystal structure is involved in several ligand-receptor contacts suggesting similarities in binding. Tyr145 lies at the corner of the loop and its side chain has no visible electron density which suggests that it is disordered. Atom NC1 of Lysl43 forms a hydrogen bond with O1 of Glu129 (Fig. la). The 2Fo-F c electron-density map also shows that the side chain of Lys143 has an additional conformation. Ser128 and Glu129, two residues involved in the HIGMS mutation Serl28-Arg,Glul29--Gly, lie close to Lys143 and are well defined in the map. Ser128 is almost completely buried and its side-chain hydroxyl group is within hydrogen-bonding distance of His249. It has been shown that the Glu129-Gly substitution found in the HIGMS mutation Ser128--Arg,Glul29--Gly affects a solventaccessible residue that might participate in binding to CD40 [29]. One possible candidate for this exposed residue is Lys143, and loss of its hydrogen bond to Glu129 may destabilize its conformation resulting in

Interestingly, all of these residues (Serl28, Glu129, Lys143 and Tyr145) are conserved in the murine CD40L sequence. Five additional single-site mutations, in which residues Serl31, Asnl80, Phe201, Glu202 and Asn240 (located at the binding site) were substituted by alanine, established that these residues are not critical for CD40 binding. In addition, two other mutations at residue positions outside

1036

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 10 of the binding site (Thr135 and Asp243) were also shown not to affect binding [29]. According to the structure, Serl31 and Thr135 lie on the AA" loop and their side chains are not exposed. Asn240, the site of glycosylation, is exposed to the solvent. Because the attached sugar would be expected to make Asn240 unavailable for interaction with CD40, we conclude that it is probably not involved in CD40 binding, in agreement with the mutagenesis results. Asp243 is a semi-exposed residue and it makes a hydrogen bond to Asn186. Asn180 is an exposed residue at the top of the molecule. Its side chain makes hydrogen bonds to residues 183 and 216. Phe201 and Glu202 both lie on the DE loop in the binding site area and are exposed to the solvent. The detrimental effects of several HIGMS mutations on CD40L appear to be caused by destabilizing its structure. For example, Trp140 is a large hydrophobic residue buried inside the protein and removal of its side chain in the HIGMS mutations Trpl40--Gly and Trpl40--Arg will obviously lead to destabilization of the structure. The valine affected by the Val126-4Ala mutation also participates in forming the hydrophobic core. Leu155 is not completely buried but lies in the middle of 13 strand B. Introduction of proline at this position, as in the Leul55-Pro HIGMS mutation, may disrupt the formation of the strand. The behavior of the HIGMS mutation Ala235--Pro can be similarly explained. Substitution of Gly144 in the HIGMS mutation Gly144--Glu may result in loss of the conformational freedom necessary at that position to form the corner of the AA" loop. Consequently, the positioning of the adjacent residues, Lys143 and Tyr145, which are known to be involved in binding, is disrupted. An interesting observation is that all of the above mentioned residues appear to be clustered (Fig. 7): Trpl40, Leu155 and Val126 participate in the formation of an area of the hydrophobic core partially formed by strands A, A", B' and B. Lys143, Gly144 and Tyr145 are exposed surface residues of the AA" loop lying very close to the above mentioned hydrophobic residues. This suggests that the CD40-binding capacity is very sensitive to perturbations in this area of CD40L. HIGMS mutations Ala123--Glu, Gly227V-al and Thr2l 1-Asp affect residues that are involved in formation of the subunit interface. Ala123 lies near the bottom of the trimer and is within van der Waals distance of three hydrophobic residues (Leu168, Val228 and Leu261) of the neighboring subunit. Gly227 packs against Tyr172 of the neighboring subunit and Thr211 lies on the EF loop close to the intersubunit interface where it appears to interact with Argl81 from the neighboring subunit. Mutations that introduce larger side chains at these positions (e.g. Thr211ll-Asp) would be expected to disturb the intersubunit packing and possibly prevent trimerization. Thus, it appears that most of the single-site HIGMS mutations affect the folding and stability of CD40L rather than playing a direct role in CD40 binding. In addition, mutations of only two of the nine targeted surface residues appear to affect CD40 binding [29].

Biological implications
CD40 ligand (CD40L) is a T cell membrane-bound pleiotropic cytokine of considerable biomedical interest because of its involvement in important immune system functions such as antibody isotype switching and establishing immunological memory. These processes are associated with the binding of CD40L to CD40, a molecule expressed on the surface of B cells. Naturally occurring mutations of CD40L in humans result in a severe immunodeficiency known as hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGMS), a fact which provides evidence that the function of CD40L is non-redundant. The crystal structure of CD40L confirms that it is a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of ligands. The crystal structure of another member of this family, lymphotoxin-a (LTa) complexed with its receptor has been described and can be used as a framework for understanding the CD40L-CD40 interaction. The CD40L structure suggests that most, if not all, of the naturally occurring single-site HIGMS mutations affect the folding and stability of the protein rather than the binding site directly. Indeed, more severe HIGMS mutations involving deletions or other drastic changes would be expected to perturb the structure much more than single-site mutations. In addition, only two of the six binding-site residues selected for mutagenesis were found to be critical for CD40 binding. A similar low frequency of hits was found in an analogous mutational study of LTot [30]. This observation raises the question of whether mutations of individual CD40L binding-site residues are generally sufficient to completely disrupt CD40LCD40 binding. If insufficient, CD40-mediated cellular signaling will continue and the mutation will be clinically undetectable. This behavior is consistent with the fact that, in the LTca-receptor complex structure, as many as 38 LTa residues are involved in the binding interface. The interface is quite extensive (520 A2 ) and is presumably of similar dimensions in the CD40L-CD40 complex. It is expected, therefore, that each residue only contributes a small fraction of the binding energy. However, the interaction of the human growth hormone with its receptor has also been shown to involve a large surface area, yet relatively few key residues contribute most of the binding energy [31]. Obviously further mutational analysis, identification of additional HIGMS mutations and determination of the CD40L-CD40 complex structure are required to resolve this issue conclusively. Considering the complexity and overlap of the various immune system processes, the fact that CD40 signaling appears to be non-redundant

Materials and methods
Crystallization
Buffer chemicals were purchased from Fisher (Boston, MA). Crystallization condition screenings were done with the Crystal ScreenTM kit from Hampton Research (Riverside, CA). A protein fragment of human CD40 ligand containing amino acid residues Gly116 to the C-terminal residue Leu261 was expressed in soluble form in Pichia pastoris yeast cells and purified by affinity chromatography. (Details of protein expression and purification will be published elsewhere.) Based on sequence homology, this fragment is expected to correspond to the TNF-like region of CD40L. Biochemical analysis (unpublished data) suggests that there is a single glycosylation site at the residue Asn240. The attached carbohydrate is expected to be N-linked high-mannose sugar of approximate molecular weight 3000 Da, however its exact chemical composition is currently unknown. The protein stock was made available as a solution of 8 mg ml-' (-0.5 mM) CD40L in phosphate-buffered saline (0.144 M Na 2HP0 4 , 0.056 M Na 2HPO 4.H 20, 1.5 M NaCI). Crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method [32]. In order to find conditions of crystallization, an incomplete factorial screen was set up [33]. In a typical experiment, protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution and a drop of the mixture was suspended under a glass cover slip over the reservoir solution. Crystals were grown out of 1.4 M Na-citrate, 50 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.5 reservoir solution. They are cuboid, easy to reproduce and can reach maximum dimensions of almost 1 mm on each side (the optimal concentration of precipitant to get the biggest crystals is 1.2 M Na-citrate). Variation of pH between 7 and 8 does not affect crystal quality. Macroseeding techniques were also successful but were not necessary to get crystals of sufficient quality. Crystal composition was assayed after washing, dissolution in water and SDS-PAGE. The gel showed a strong band of -20 kDa and a much fainter band of 17 kDa. It was later shown that the fainter band corresponds to non-glycosylated protein.

Calculation of the Matthews volume [36] gives VM= 2 .97 A3 Da-' assuming one molecule per asymmetric unit and a molecular weight equal to 20000 Da. Thus, it was not clear initially whether there were one or two monomers in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement All subsequent molecular replacement and refinement computing was done with the X-PLOR program package [37]. Molecular graphics manipulations were performed with QUANTA software (Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, MA). Both X-PLOR and QUANTA were run on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 computer workstation (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA) . To investigate whether non-crystallographic symmetry was present, the self-rotation function was calculated with 8-4 A data. A very strong peak was found for 4=90 ° , Jt=90 ° , K=120 which obviously corresponds to the crystallographic threefold axis. This is expected to coincide with the threefold axis of the trimer of CD40L. In addition, weaker peaks appeared for ° 4=0° , qi=30 ° , K=180 0 and =0 0 , qs=90, K=1800 and )=0O, ° ° t4=150 , K=120 corresponding to twofold axes perpendicular to the threefold axis. As shown later, none of these axes corresponded to non-crystallographic symmetry. A three-dimensional model of the human CD40L was constructed by using the murine CD40L model [22] as a framework, using QUANTA protein homology modeling software. The murine CD40L model itself was based on the TNFot crystal structure. The model was used as a probe for molecular replacement calculations.

Data collection and processing
Crystals were mounted inside capillary tubes and tested for diffraction capacity on the X-ray beam. Oscillation photographs showed strong diffraction to high resolution. Initial inspection of the photographs suggested an almost cubic lattice. A large crystal (0.8x0.8x0.8 mm3 ) was equilibrated gradually in a cryoprotectant solution of 20% glycerol, 1.2 M Na-citrate, 50 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, mounted on a loop and immediately frozen in a -1500 C liquid nitrogen gas stream. The technique of freezing the crystals essentially immortalizes them and produces a much higher quality data set. A native X-ray data set, up to 1.75 A resolution, was collected by using a Nicolet/Siemens multiwire area detector (Siemens, Inc., Karlsruhe, Germany). The data were integrated and reduced using BUDDHA [34] and the CCP4 program package [35]. The data collection required about 5 days. The systematic absences in the intensities of the data indicated that the reflections could be indexed in a rhombohedral lattice with approximate cell dimensions a=b=c=55 A and ca=P=ry=91° .

Calculation of the cross-rotation function by using a 2.50 angle grid and 8-4 A data produced a strong peak 4.5cr above the mean, at Euler angles 01=234.5 ° , 02=5.0, 03=234.5 ° . Rotation of the model according to that solution and subsequent generation of symmetry-related molecules corresponding to the threefold crystallographic symmetry produces a trimer with the threefold axis parallel to the z axis, as expected. The exact rotation solution was found with Patterson correlation refinement. No significant second peak was observed in the rotation function. In order to do the translation search, the model probe was rotated according to the first peak of the rotation search and translated so that the center of mass of the trimer would lie on the z axis. This was assumed to be close to the expected position because the threefold axis of the trimer appeared to lie on the z axis of the unit cell. Initial attempts to find a clear peak in the translation function on the xy plane failed. Trimmed model probes, containing mostly core residues the structures of which were more likely to be conserved among different members of the TNF family, produced translation functions with a clustering of peaks at locations close to the expected ones. One of those trimmed models containing all backbone atoms as well as side-chain atoms for residues 123-127, 168-177, 205-208, 225-229 and 256-261 produced a peak with a correlation coefficient of 3.3cr above the mean at x=0.053, y=0. 0 53 . This peak was the highest on the list of peaks and was close to the expected position. By generating symmetry-related molecules and displaying them with computer graphics it was found that all the CD40L molecules in the unit cell packed satisfactorily and that there was not enough space for a second molecule. Thus, we concluded that there was only one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The existence of twofold symmetry in the self-rotation function appears to be a consequence of internal symmetry within the molecule, possibly related to the high content of parallel P strands. In fact, the self-rotation function calculated from structure factors derived from the model shows peaks corresponding to twofold symmetry. Model building and crystallographic refinement The paraml9.pro stereochemical parameter set of the X-PLOR package was used for all refinement calculations. The partial model that was used to find the solution of the translation function was subjected to rigid-body refinement by using 7.5-2.5 A data. The R and Rfree [38] factors after the initial rigid-body refinement were 49.9% and 51.4%, respectively. The test data set used for the calculation of Rfree contained 10% of the data. The partial model was subjected to 40 steps of conventional positional refinement and a cycle of simulated annealing with an initial temperature of 2500 K. The R and Rfree factors dropped to 31.2% and 43.1%, respectively. To reduce model bias, a partial model was used for map calculation and refinement. The resolution range used was 7.5-2.5 A. Simulated annealing omit maps [39], calculated by consecutively omitting 10% of the model each time, showed which parts of the model could be used for phasing. The model was modified to include only residues sufficiently well defined in annealed omit maps. The initial model included 815 atoms out of a total of 1374 atoms of the complete model. 3Fo-2Fc maps were used for cycles of model building and refinement. Typically, cycles consisted of model building, positional refinement and B-factor refinement. Occasionally, simulated annealing was performed. As the phases improved, more atoms were added to the model. Initially, grouped B factors were assigned for each
C strand (one for main-chain atoms and one for side-chain atoms). Later on, grouped B factors, and finally, individual atomic B factors, were refined for each residue. Only manual structure modifications that resulted in a lower Rfree value after refinement were accepted. When R and Rfree reached 31.1% and 36.4% respectively, the resolution was extended to 2.25 A and finally to 2 A. Water molecules were added by using the X-solvate utility of QUANTA 4.1. This approach identified peaks higher than 3cr in an Fo-Fc map and waters were placed in cases consistent with the existence of hydrogen bonds of reasonable length and geometry. Both occupancies and temperature factors were refined for the water molecules. Water molecules having corresponding 2Fo-F c density <l1r, or high B factors after the refinement, were eliminated from the model. The current model has an R factor of 21.8% and an Rfree of 29.1%.
