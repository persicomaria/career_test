As Plasmodium falciparum lives in an oxygenrich environment in humans (intraerythrocytic and hepatic stages), the parasite is subjected to the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1]. This oxidative stress can result from external attack by products of the host immune system and from the metabolism of the parasite itself (for example, while digesting haemoglobin in the host red blood cells) [2]. In addition, a number of anti-malarial drugs are endoperoxides, and they

can burden the parasite with substantial oxidative stress [3]. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase are the three major enzymes known to be involved in the cellular anti-ROS system [4]. Hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by SOD at the initial step of ROS detoxification, is subsequently eliminated by catalase and/or GPx. The presence of endogenous SOD and GPx have been demonstrated in P. falciparum [4,5], whereas endogenous catalase has not been clearly reported in this parasite [6]. Peroxiredoxin is a recently described family of antioxidants that are highly conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes [7]. These enzymes are known collectively as thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) (previously called TSA, thiol-specific antioxidant) [6]. TPx acts as an antioxidant enzyme by eliminating hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. The catalytic mechanism of the enzyme involves the redox-active cysteine, which is highly

conserved in the vicinity of the 47th position of its amino acid sequence (Cys47) [8]. We report here the cDNA cloning, expression and functional characterization of a TPx from the human malaria parasite P. falciparum. The composite full-length cDNA sequence of P.

falciparum TPx (PfTPx-1) comprised 710 bp and coded for 220 amino acid residues with the predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of 25.2 kDa and 6.3, respectively. The BLASTX search [9] of the PfTPx-1 cDNA sequence revealed significant sequence similarities with other

The FCR-3 strain of P. falciparum was synchronized [15] and cultured under the modified method of Trager and Jensen [16]. Poly (A)+ RNA was prepared for the late trophozoites by QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan). Approximately 250 bp of the 5% region of TPx cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number T18004) was obtained from the P. falciparum expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [17]. The missing 3% region of the cDNA was obtained by the 3% rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR method [18]. The first strand cDNA was synthesized from the parasite mRNA with Not I-(dT)18 primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of the cDNA was performed using sense primer 5%-AAC TCC AAA GAA TCT CAC GG-3%, which was derived from the EST sequence, and antisense primer 5%-TGG AAG AAT TCG CGG CCG CAG-3%, which corresponded to the RACE-adapter. The full-length cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using the late trophozoite cDNA as template with oligonucleotide primers 5%-CCT ATT AAC AAT GGC TTA CC-3% and 5%-TCA GGT GAT TAC ATT TGA AC-3%. The oligonucleotide primers were designed on the basis of the EST-originated 5% end sequence and the 3% end sequence which was obtained in the present study. The cDNA was sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method with an automated sequencer (model 310, PE Biosystems Japan, Chiba, Japan). The GENETYX software program (Software Development Co. Ltd., Japan) was used to analyze the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. Sequences are from O. 6ol6ulus (OvTPx-2; U31052), Rice (RiceTPx; D63917) and human ORF6 (HuOrf6; D14662). Identical residues are marked with asterisks and conserved residues are marked with dots. The dashes indicate gaps introduced between the sequences. The conserved sequence (PVCT) around the redox-active cysteine (Cys47) is boxed.

trophozoite and ring stage. However, the band intensity observed was approximately two times stronger in the late trophozoite as compared with that in the ring stage. This difference in band intensity was visually estimated using the intensities produced with serially diluted recombinant protein as standard (Fig. 2A, lanes 1­4). Comparison of the band intensity of the parasite lysate to that of the recombinant protein suggested that

eukaryotic 1-Cys peroxiredoxins. An alignment of PfTPx-1 amino acid sequence with that reported as 1-Cys peroxiredoxin in several eukaryotic organisms is shown in Fig. 1. The amino acid sequence identities between PfTPx-1 and the homologues shown in Fig. 1 ranged from 50.5% (Onchocerca 6ol6ulus) to 41.7% (Rice). The presence of the PVCT sequence flanking the conserved Cys47 and the absence of the conserved Cys170 residue in the sequence suggest that the PfTPx-1 encoded 1-Cys peroxiredoxin. This is the first case of 1-Cys peroxiredoxin reported in protozoan parasites. In order to produce an antiserum against PfTPx-1 and to demonstrate its enzymatic activity, we produced a recombinant PfTPx-1 protein. The coding sequence of PfTPx-1 was expressed as a histidine fusion protein (rPfTPx-1) in Escherichia coli and purified on a Ni-column. In Western blot analysis, mouse anti-rPfTPx-1 serum recognized the parasite protein with a molecular mass of approximately 25 kDa, in good accordance with the size predicted from PfTPx-1 amino acid sequence (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). The N-terminal leader peptide of 3 kDa was encoded by the expression vector, making the molecular mass of rPfTPx-1 approximately 28 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The anti-serum did not react with the human erythrocyte peroxiredoxin [10] (Fig. 2A, lane 7). The 25-kDa band was detected in two different developmental stages of the parasite, namely late

Fig. 2. (A) Identification of native PfTPX-1 protein in P. falciparum extracts. The coding sequence of PfTPx was amplified by PCR and directionally ligated into the plasmid expression vector pTrcHisB (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain TOP 10. The fusion protein with N-terminal 6-histidine tag (rPfTPx-1) was expressed by induction of the bacterial culture with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). The protein was purified on a Ni-column (ProBondTM Resin, Invitrogen) under non-denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against the purified rPfTPx protein were produced in mice, under the Guiding Principles of Animal Experimentation in the Research Institute, International Medical Center of Japan. Parasites in different stages of development were obtained from the sorbitol-synchronized culture [15,16]. The parasite-infected erythrocytes were lysed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% saponin. The parasite pellets were washed several times with PBS and solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer [19]. Extracts (15 mg) prepared from parasites in different developmental stages, the parasite-uninfected human erythrocyte lysate [10] (10 mg) or the Ni-column purified rPfTPx-1 protein were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. The separated polypeptides were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes [20] and reacted with mouse anti-rPfTPx-1 serum.

Reaction mixture containing 40 mM FeCl3, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 was pre-incubated with or without the rPfTPx-1 protein (25 ­ 400 mg ml - 1) at 37°C for 1 h. After pre-incubation, 500 ng pUC19 plasmid DNA was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for another 3 h.

a The consumption of H2O2 by rPfTPx-1 was evaluated using 2,2%-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS)­ H2O2­peroxidase system [12]. Reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA and the rPfTPx-1 protein was pre-incubated with or without thiols [0.2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mM glutathione (GSH) or 0.5 mM GSH] at 25°C for 30 min. After pre-incubation, H2O2 (50 mM) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min. The resulting H2O2 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 414 nm in 1 ml of 0.1 M KH2PO4, pH 6.0, containing 0.05 mM ABTS and 0.1 U of horseradish peroxidase, using the previously described molar extinction coefficient (m= 3.6×104 M-1 cm-1) [12]. Values are means9 S.D. from three experiments.

the PfTPx-1 is constituting about 0.5% of the total proteins in the late trophozoites. An antioxidant activity of rPfTPx-1 was evaluated by thiol mixed-function oxidation (MFO) assay (Fig. 2B). The assay employs a system that generates hydroxyl radicals to damage DNA [11]. In the absence of rPfTPx-1 fusion protein, the hydroxyl radicals produced in the system caused nicking of the DNA, as evidenced by a shift in gel mobility of the supercoiled plasmid (Fig. 2B, lane 3). The addition of purified rPfTPx-1 fusion protein to the MFO system at concentrations of 200 and 400 mg ml - 1 prevented nicking of the supercoiled DNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5), demonstrating antioxidant activity of PfTPx-1. Hydrogen peroxide consumption by rPfTPx-1 was measured using 2,2%-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) ­ H2O2 ­ peroxidase system [12]. Table 1 shows the thiol peroxidase activity of rPfTPx-1 to remove H2O2. The activity of removing approximately 12 nM H2O2 min - 1 mg - 1 recombinant protein was dependent on the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) or glutathione (GSH). After heating at 95°C for 5 min, the rPfTPx-1 lost its ability to remove H2O2 (data not shown). Identification and characterization of a TPx from the human malaria parasite P. falciparum suggest that the parasite likely uses peroxiredoxin as one of the enzymes to reduce peroxides. One proposed function of TPx in malaria is the reduction of the haemoglobin-derived ROS [2,6]. The

haemoglobin metabolism of the parasite results in the generation of super oxide, which is subsequently converted into hydrogen peroxide by endogenous or host SOD activity [2,5]. In order to detoxify this hydrogen peroxide, P. falciparum must express some antioxidant activity. Interestingly, the antimalarial endoperoxides, such as artemisinin (qinghaosu), affects the parasite mainly in its late trophozoite stage [3,13]. The fact that native PfTPx-1 was detected preferentially in the late trophozoites by Western blotting suggests involvement of this enzyme in the haemoglobin metabolism of P. falciparum. The presence of GPx has been demonstrated in P. falciparum, but the function of this enzyme in the parasite has not yet been demonstrated [4]. Since 1-Cys peroxiredoxin only requires small thiols such as DTT for its regeneration [14], the host glutathione, which is abundant in the erythrocyte, could be the source of thiol for the PfTPx-1 system. Efforts to identify PfTPx-1 in the P. falciparum digestive vacuole, the center of haemoglobin metabolism, is currently underway.
