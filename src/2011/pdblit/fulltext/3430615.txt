The H4 isoenzyme of porcine heart lactate dehydrogenase complexed with coenzyme and a substrate analog has been found to have 222 molecular symmetry. The three molecular 2-fold axes have been related to the corresponding P, Q and R 2-fold axes in the dogfish M4 isoenzyme. The orientation of these axes, as well as the position of the molecular center in the asymmetric unit, has been determined. An electron density map to a resolution of 6 A based on the measured pig H4 LDHase:~ structure amplitudes and phases, calculated for a properly oriented and positioned tetramer of the dogfish M4 isoenzyme in the pig H4 cell, has been calculated. In order to avoid the effect of the assumed LDHase model, the electron density was then averaged over the four subunits. The only observable difference in the porcine H4 LDHase molequle with respect to the dogfish M4 LDHase structure was a displacement in the vicinity of the essential histidine 195.
1. I n t r o d u c t i o n

Lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), a tetrameric NAD+-dependent enzyme of molecular weight 144,000, catalyzes the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate in the glycolytic pathway. The four subunits, each of which is capable of binding one molecule of coenzyme and one Of substrate, show no co-operative effects (Heck, 1969; Schwert et al., 1967). Two subunit types are found in most tissues, originating from two distinct genetic loci. The predominant form in aerobic tissue has been designated H (or B), while the form which predominates in anaerobic tissue has been designated M (or A). The H and M subunits differ in their immunological (Pesce et aL, 1964), physical, and chemical properties (for recent reviews see Everse & Kaplan, 1973; Holbrook et al., 1975). These differences have led to the suggestion that they have different metabolic~ roles (Cahn et al., 1962; Kaplan et a/., 1968). However, despite these differences, some degree of structural slmilarity is indicated by the lack of preference of H or M subunits for each other during the formation of hybrid tetramers (Chilson et al., 1965; Markert, 1963). In order to determine the structural basis for the isoenzyme differences, we have undertaken a structural study of the H4 isoenzyme from porcine heart tissue, W e report here the orientation and position of the pig H4 isoenzyme in its crystal cell, and a prellminavy comparison of this structure at 6 A resolution with that of the known dogfish M4 isoenzyme (Rossmann eta/., 1971). Hackert et a~. (1973) have determined the orientation of the three molecular 2-fold axes and the position of the

The H~ isoenzyme of porcine hear~ LDHaso was purified as described previously (Eventoff e~ a~., 1974). Crystals of the ternary complex LDHase:NADH:oxamate were grown from sodium phosphate buffer (0.05 M, p H 7.8) e o n t ~ n g 1.83 to 1.87 M-amr-onium sulfate, 0"06 E-sodium oxamat~, 1"6 m~-NADH, and 8 mg of LDHase/ml.

X-ray d~ff~action data were collected by the precession method, u~iug the scheme shown in ~ig. 1. Altogether, 28 ~]m packs were processed using an Optronics ~]rn scanner interfaced with an IBM7094 computer (Ford, 1974). The final R factor, based on intensities, for 8461 reflections appearing on more than one ~lrn, after the ~lm planes were sealed together, was 10.5%. There were then 26,074 independent reflections to 2.5 ~_ resolution of which 3231 were within the 6 A sphere. Abbreviation used. LDHase, lactate dehydrogenase.

3. Results a n d Discussion
(a) Molecular symmetry and Orientation of pig H4 lactate dehydrogenoae The rotation function (Rossmann & Blow, 1962) was used to determine the molecular symmetry elements and their orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes. 0nly the data between 10 A and 6/~ resolution were used in the calculations. The elimination of the inner reflections sharpens the rotation function. The original Patterson contained 2796 terms which were modified to remove the origin peak. I t was compared" with a large term Patterson which contained 346 -nmodifled terms. The radius of integration around the Patterson origin was 50/~. In all calculations the 27 nearest neighbors of each non-integral reciprocal lattice point were used for interpolation. This includes the majority of terms in the first positive node of the 6/ function (Hr < 0.725). The 2[r~ Patterson symmetry causes the asymmetric unit of the rotation function to be contained within the limits 0 ~ ~ ~b ~ 90~ and --90 ~ < < 90 ~ for each value of K (x, ~b, and ~ are defined as in Rossmaun & Blow (1962) except that the sense of ~ is reversed).

The rotation function search for 2-fold axes (Fig. 2) contains, in addition to the origin peak representing the crystallographic 2-fold axis, three large peaks and four small peaks. The former are on a line K = 180 ~ ~ = 90 ~ and the latter on the lines K = 180~ ~ = 90 ~ and x = 180 ~ ~ = 270 ~ Searches for both 8-fold and 4-fold axes were carried out to estimate the background of the function and were featureless in both cases. These results are consistent with the pig H4 ~tetramer having 222 molecular symmetry. Two of the small peaks and the large peak along the a* direction correspond to the three 2-fold axes of molecule A, while the remainfqg two small

peaks and the same large peak along a* correspond to the other, 2-fold axis related molecule B. Thus, the peak at ~ ~- 90 ~ ~ = 0 ~ is a double peak, while the small peaks are single peaks. The remaini,g large peak at ~ ~ 90 ~ ~ ---- 90 ~ inter-relates the three 2-fold axes of the crystallographically related molecules A and B. In order to determine more precisely the position of the molecular 2-fold axes, the line K ---180~ ~ ~- 90 ~ was searched in 2.5-deg. interval]. The results (Fig. 3) indicate that two of the molecular 2-fold axes are rotated 12.5~ from the 5 and --c crystallographic axes, respectively, and the third axis is along the a* direction of the unit cell.

The three 2-fold axes of dogfish M~ LDHase have been labeled P, Q and (Rossmann et a~., 1973). The conservation of these axes in pig M4 LDHase (Hackert et o~., 1973) as well as the conservation of the Q-axis in 8-malate dehydrogenase provides evidence for the conservation of tertiary and quaternary structure among the dehydrogenases. In order to verify the conservation as well as determine the correspondence of the molecular symmetry axes in the pig H4 isoenzyme, a comparison rotation function between pig H 4 LDHase~:NADH:oxamate and dogfish M~ LDHase:NAD-pyruvate was calculated. The known electron density of one tetramer of the dogfish M4 LDHase:NADpyruvate adduct was isolated and placed in a large P222 cell (Hackert et ~., 1973). The conditions of the rotation function were identical to the rotation function of the pig H 4 LDHase described above, except that here the P222 Patterson was represented by 389 large terms. The P, Q and R axes were aligned in turn with the 2-fold axis directed along a* in the pig H 4 structure. The dogfish LDHase Patterson was then rotated in 2.5-deg. interval] around the superimposed axes. The large peak (Fig. 4) at K --~ 12.5~ when P is aligned along the a* direction of the pig H 4 cell is greater than twice the height of any other' peak. The P axis must, therefore, correspond to 2 the axis directed along a* in the pig H~ structure, while the Q and R axes are rotated 12.5 ~ from the --c and 5 crystallographic axes, respectively, in conR~nation of the results obtained by the comparison of the pig H 4 Patterson with itself. Farthermore, the orientation of the pig H 4 tetramer is almost identical with that predicted by Hackert et ~. (1973).

(b) The ~osition of ~ig H E lact~e dehydrogenaae in its crystal cell The known structure of the dogfish M4 isoenzyme was used to determine the position of the molecular center of the pig H~ isoenzyme in its crystal cell (Tollin, 1966,1969; Rossmann et a~., 1972; Cro~ther & Blow, 1967; Karle, 1972). Coefficients for the translation function, given by the previously determined molecular orientation, were calculated to a resolution of 6 A using a sphere of 40 A radius around the molecular center of the dogfish M4 LDHase:NAD-pyruvate tetramer. The origin of the pig H4 cell was defined relative to the crystallographic 2-fold axis and by setting the molecular center at y = 0. The translation search is ]imit~l to two dimensions due to the independence of the y co-ordinate in the C2 space group (Fig. 5). R factors,

translation function. The R factors were calculated from the translation coefficients (Fig. 6), and independently from the Fourier transform of the electron density of a properly oriented tetramer of the dogfish M4 LDHase:NAD-pyruvate adduct in the pig H4 cell (Fig. 7). The latter has the advantage of using the known molecular envelope instead of a spherical appro~mation, although it suffers from computational disadvantages. The results obtained by both methods (l~igs 6 and 7) indicate that the molecular center is located at x----0.294, z----0.253. R factors calculated for the next largest observed features in the translation function (Fig. 5) gave only background values. Furthermore, these positions can be ruled out from packing considerations. The determined position of the molecular center of the pig H4 isoenzyme is within 4 A of that predict~l by Hacker~ ~ al. (1973). However, the R factor searches (Figs 6 and 7) indicate that even a small error in position gives rise to background values.

tetramer of the dogfish M4 LDHase:NAD-pyruvate adduet in the pig H 4 cell and from the experimental amplitudes. The electron density map was skewed in sections of constant Q and then averaged across the three molecular 2-fold axes. This process tends to remove the influence of the dogfish M4 LDHase structure in addition to providing a more interpretable map (Buehner d al., 1974). An estimate of the accuracy with which the molecule obeyed each of the three different 2-fold axes can be obtained from the ratio of the root-mean-square deviation from the mean divided by the root-mean-square density (Fig. 8). A discussion of the significance of this ratio is given in the legend to Figure 8. The two structures were compared at the present resolution by plotting the positions of the m-carbon atoms of the dogfish M~ structure on the pig H~ electron density. An examination of the fit of these positions in the electron density indicates that the structures of the two isoenzymes are very similar. The largest observable difference was in the catalytic region and consists of an apparent small movement of the polypeptide chain away from the molecular center (i.e. away from the active site) between residues 190 and 199. Both main chain and side chain atoms of the dogfish ]YI~ structure are superimposed on the relevant electron density in Fig. 9. No such change is evident in comparing the isomorphous LDHase:NAD-pyruvate and LDHase:NADH: oxamate electron densities of dogfish l~I4 LDHase at 3.0 A resolution (Rossmann et aL, 1971). This peptide chain contains histidine 195, which is essential for the catalytic activity of both isoenzymes (Woenckhaus et al., 1969; Adams e~ al., 1973), The sequence of this peptide is almost identical for these two isoenzymes (Woenckhaus et al., 1969; Taylor et al., 1973) except for a change in residue 194 from glutamlne in the M~ isoenzyme to glutamate in the H 4 isoenzyme. This change could account for the movement by altering the intramolecular interaction of this residue from serine 318 in the M4 to lysine 317 in the H4 structure. Indeed, inspection of the high-resolution model of the dogfish M4 structure indicates that such a change in the intramolecular interaction would cause a movement of the peptide in the correct direction. Thus it is possible that the differences in the properties of the l~I and H isoenzymes may in par~ be due to differences in the conformation of the essential histidine residue 195. However, the necessary poor definition of a lowresolution map does not permit such conclusions without some caution. The high-resohition model should, when available, show in detail the similarities and differences between the two structures with greater precision and, hopefully, lead to an understanding of the structural basis for the behavior of the two LDHase isoenzymes.
