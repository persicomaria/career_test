In prokaryotes, RuvA-RuvB complexes play a crucial role in the migration of the Holliday junction, which is a key intermediate of homologous recombination. RuvA binds to the Holliday junction and enhances the ATPase activity of RuvB required for branch migration. RuvA adopts a unique domain structure, which assembles into a tetrameric molecule. The previous mutational and proteolytic analyses suggested that mutations in a carboxyl-terminal domain (domain III) impair binding of RuvA to RuvB. In order to clarify the functional role of each domain in vitro, we established the recombinant expression systems, which allow us to analyze structural and biochemical properties of each domain separately. A small-angle X-ray scattering solution study, combined with X-ray crystallographic analyses, was applied to the tetrameric full-length RuvA and its tetrameric NH2 region (domains I and II) lacking the domain III. These results demonstrated that domain III can be completely separate from the tetrameric major core of the NH2 region and freely mobile in solution, through a remarkably ¯exible loop. Biochemical analyses indicated that domain III not only interacts with RuvB, but also modulates its ATPase activity. This modulation may facilitate the dynamic coupling between RuvA and RuvB during branch migration.

Introduction
The Holliday junction is a central DNA intermediate in homologous recombination, which is responsible for the exchange of genetic material. Thus, the speci®c interactions between various proteins and the Holliday junction are regarded as key to the understanding of the recombinational process. The most crucial steps in the late stages of recombination pathway are branch migration and the resolution of the junction connecting two DNA duplexes. In bacteria, the molecular system composed of the ruvA, ruvB, and ruvC gene products is responsible for branch migration and junction resolution (for reviews, see Shinagawa & Iwasaki, 1996; West, 1996, 1997). The tetrameric RuvA proAbbreviations used: SAXS, small-angle X-ray scattering; rmsd, root-mean-square displacement; BSA, bovine serum albumin.

tein binds the Holliday junction speci®cally and forms a complex with the hexameric RuvB (Stasiak et al., 1994), and this complex promotes the migration of the junction point, which is driven by ATP hydrolysis. Crystallographic studies (Rafferty et al., 1996; Nishino et al., 1998) and mutational analyses (Nishino et al., 1998) revealed that RuvA forms a unique tetrameric architecture, where each 22 kDa subunit consists of three domains with distinct features. The interdomain b-structures between two domains I join each subunit to form a tetramer with a central 4-fold axis. Domain II contains two helix-hairpin-helix DNA-binding motifs, and the recently solved crystal structure of an RuvA-DNA complex revealed that these motifs interact with DNA backbones (Hargreaves et al., 1998; Roe et al., 1998). Domain III is completely separated from the remaining domains I and II, and instead, within the crystal structure of RuvA, it is ®xed to the adjacent subunit, through a minor hydrophobic interaction (Rafferty et al., 1996; Nishino et al., 1998).

408 The combined use of proteolytic and mutational analyses suggested that domain III, consisting of 40 amino acid residues, is involved in RuvB binding. The remaining NH2 region that consists of domains I and II is responsible for Holliday junction binding, as in full-length RuvA (Nishino et al., 1998). Here, we report the evidence from the results of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), combined Ê with the 2.5 A resolution crystal structure of the NH2 region, that domain III is indeed separate from the tetrameric major core and is freely mobile in solution. We also examined the individual functions of domain III and the NH2 region, particularly their inhibitory effects on normal RuvAB activity. Taken together, the results indicate that, independently of DNA, the remarkably mobile domain III modulates exclusively the RuvB function through the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, which is required for the branch migration activity. This implies that domain III may bear the novel function of controlling the ATPase cycle of the RuvB motor.

Regulation of RuvB Function by RuvA

Results
Expression of truncated RuvA proteins and analysis of in vivo function The previous crystallographic and mutational analyses revealed the intriguing allotments of distinct functions to each domain (Nishino et al., 1998). To obtain clearer insights into the functional aspect of the domain organization, we constructed

truncated RuvA segments containing the NH2 region or domain III alone (Figure 1(a)). For in vivo functional analyses, the respective multi-copy plasmids were introduced into both Escherichia coli strains HRS2000 (ÁruvA) and AB1157 (ruvA) to assess how the expression of each domain affects the UV sensitivity of these strains (Figure 1(b) and (c)). If the truncated forms of the protein retain the complete function of RuvA, they should be able to complement the UV sensitivity of the ruvA deletion strain. If truncated proteins inhibit the activity of the full-length RuvA, they would be expected to increase the UV sensitivity of the wild-type strain. Actually, neither the NH2 region nor domain III could complement the UV sensitivity of the ruvA deletion strain, indicating that they are defective in some biochemical activities necessary for cellular recovery after DNA damage. However, the expression of either region in wild-type Escherichia coli showed dominant negative effects that increased the UV sensitivity, suggesting that both regions still retained some functions, which, however, interfered with the wild-type activity. We previously found that an amino acid substitution within domain III (L170A) abolished the ability to bind RuvB (Nishino et al., 1998). The fusion protein of the L170A domain III showed no effect on the UV sensitivity of the wild-type strain (Figure 1(c)), suggesting that the increased UV sensitivity caused by domain III is related to the RuvA-RuvB interactions. Taken together, these in vivo experimental results indicate that the constructed regions retain impaired RuvA functions. Thus, we overexpressed

and puri®ed the NH2 region and domain III to characterize them in vitro. A mutation in domain III decreases the a -helical content Using circular dichroism (CD), we examined the secondary structure of both the wild-type domain III and the L170A mutant domain III (Figure 2). As compared with the wild-type, the spectrum from the mutant showed decreases in the band intensities at 193, 208, and 222 nm, which are sensitive for a-helical structures. This indicates that the substitution of Ala for Leu170 causes a conformational change in domain III. The previous CD measurement of the full-length mutant RuvA showed little change in the CD spectrum (Nishino et al., 1998), which may be due to the minor contribution of domain III to the CD spectrum of the full-length protein. Ê Crystal structure of the NH2 region at 2.5 A The crystal structure of the NH2 region alone Ê was determined at 2.5 A resolution by the molecular replacement method (Table 1). The superposition between the two crystal structures from the NH2 region (Figure 3, yellow) and the full-length RuvA molecule (Figure 3, white) yielded a root-

Ê mean-square displacement (rmsd) value of 0.79 A for the main-chain atoms, showing that the truncated NH2 region in the crystal retained the same structure as that of the intact RuvA protein. The conservation of the interdomain interactions and the similarity of the temperature factor distributions (data not shown) between the two structures indicate that domain III does not contribute to the structural maintenance of the NH2 region. This result is in agreement with the previous biochemical ®ndings that the tetrameric RuvA architecture, responsible for the Holliday junction binding, is independent of domain III (Nishino et al., 1998). Solution structures of RuvA and the NH2 region analyzed by SAXS To gain further insights into behavior in solution, we measured SAXS of the full-length RuvA and the NH2 region. Guinier plots indicated that the specimens for full-length RuvA and the NH2 region were adequate to analyze their behavior in solution (Figure 4(a)). These two tetrameric molecules with a 4-fold axis at the center showed gyraÊ Ê tion radii (Rg) of 33 A and 29 A, respectively, both of which are independent of the protein concentration (Figure 4(b)). In contrast, the Rg values, calculated from the unhydrated crystal structures of Ê the full-length and the NH2 region, are 29 A and Ê 28 A, respectively (data not shown). It is frequently observed for soluble globular proteins that experÊ imental Rg values are larger by 1 to 2 A than those calculated from the unhydrated crystal structures. If one takes water of hydration into account, the

discrepancy is generally explained for the NH2 region (Olah et al., 1993; Svergun et al., 1998). HowÊ ever, hydration alone cannot explain the 4 A increase of the full-length RuvA Rg value in solution. In the case of calmodulin, on the other hand, Ê the experimental Rg is 4 A smaller than the calculated value (Heidorn & Trewhella, 1988). This is explained by the ensemble average of many ¯uctuated structures (Kataoka et al., 1996). Similarly, the increased Rg value may result from the behavior of the full-length RuvA in solution. The conformational change is more clearly revealed from the P(r) functions, which correspond to the interatomic distance distribution within the molecules (Figure 4(c)). In contrast to the similar distribution in the NH2 regions between the crystal and solution structures, the full-length RuvA in solution showed a strikingly larger maximum distance than that calculated from the crystal structure. Taken together, it is suggested that the discrepancy between the solution and crystal structures of full-length RuvA could be explained from the mobility of domain III. The NH2 region and domain III inhibit RuvA-dependent Holliday junction loading of RuvB To analyze the effect of the NH2 region and domain III on RuvAB Holliday junction complex

formation, an assay was used that involves the incubation of RuvA and RuvB with the synthetic Holliday, subsequent glutaraldehyde crosslinking, and detection of the complex by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Parsons & West, 1993). The RuvA-Holliday junction complex and the NH2 region-Holliday junction complex each showed a clear band shift (Figure 5, lanes b and c). The RuvAB-Holliday junction tripartite complex exhibits a smeared lower mobility band (Figure 5, lane d). Western blotting analysis con®rmed that the tri-

partite complex indeed corresponds to this smeared band (data not shown). Neither the NH2 region (Figure 5, lane i) nor domain III (data not shown) could form the tripartite complex. The addition of wild-type domain III (Figure 5, lanes e and f) or the NH2 region (Figure 5, lanes j and k) inhibited RuvA-mediated RuvAB-Holliday junction complex formation, while the mutant domain III showed no effect (Figure 5, lanes g and h). Both the NH2 region and domain III inhibit branch migration by the wild-type RuvAB proteins To analyze the effects of the NH2 region or domain III on ATP-dependent branch migration by RuvAB, each protein was added to an in vitro branch migration assay mediated by full-length RuvA and RuvB. Both the NH2 region and domain III substantially inhibited the branch migration activity (Figure 6(a) and (b)). Notably, more than ten times the amount of domain III was required to obtain the same inhibitory effect as the NH2 region. On the other hand, domain III with the L170A mutation exhibits no inhibitory effect on the branch migration under the experimental conditions. Domain III modulates RuvB ATPase activity We have analyzed the effect of the NH2 region and domain III on the ATPase activity of RuvB in comparison with that of the full-length RuvA. In the absence of DNA (Figure 7(a)), the addition of excess domain III inhibited the ATPase activity, while the L170A mutant domain III reduced this

inhibitory effect. An excessive addition of the NH2 region hardly affected the ATPase activity, whereas the full-length RuvA showed inhibition similar to that of the wild-type domain III. In the presence of the same synthetic Holliday junction as that used in Figure 5, the full-length RuvA remarkably stimulated the ATPase activity (Figure 7(b)), as reported (Parsons & West, 1993). Domain III still showed a similar inhibitory effect, while the addition of the NH2 region showed a marginal effect on the activity. In the presence of full-length RuvA and the Holliday junction (Figure 7(c)), an excess addition of the NH2 region or the wild-type domain III caused a decrease in the overall ATPase activity, which is comparable to the inhibition of branch migration by the NH2 region or domain III. These results indicate that the isolated domain III unconditionally inhibits the RuvB ATPase activity, whereas the NH2 region inhibits only in the presence of RuvA and Holliday junction.

The reactions were carried out with 3 mM wild-type RuvB (a) in the absence of DNA, (b) in the presence of 3 mM synthetic Holliday junction, and (c) in the presence of 6 mM full-length RuvA and 3 mM synthetic Holliday junction. In each reaction, 2Â and 10Â indicate addition of 6 mM and 30 mM, respectively, of full-length RuvA, the NH2 region, and the domain III.

Discussion
The high level of mobility of domain III was suggested from its high temperature factors in the crystal structure of the full-length RuvA tetramer (Rafferty et al., 1996; Nishino et al., 1998) and from its rapid release from the major tetrameric core by proteolytic cleavage of the ¯exible loop (Nishino et al., 1998). Thus, we presumed that domain III may not be ®xed to the tetrameric core of domains I and II, and swings freely in solution. This Ê hypothesis is supported from the 2.5 A resolution crystal structure of the tetrameric NH2 region (Figure 3) and from the SAXS results on the fulllength RuvA and the NH2 region (Figure 4). In agreement with this ®nding, Chamberlain et al. (1998) recently proposed from neutron scattering that domain III of mycobacterium RuvA moves upon binding to junction DNA. The minor movements of domain III, which would be induced by DNA binding, were also reported in the two crystal structures of RuvA-DNA complex (Hargreaves et al., 1998; Roe et al., 1998). The necessity of this tethering by the ¯exible loop for the RuvA function is supported by the observation that the two separated NH2 region and domain III were unable to promote the RuvB-mediated branch migration (data not shown). In the in vivo UV sensitivity assay, the overexpression of the NH2 region exhibited a dominant negative effect (Figure 1(b)). This effect would be due to the competitive inhibition against the fulllength RuvA-Holliday junction binding by the NH2 region, which has a DNA af®nity comparable to that of the full-length RuvA in vitro (Nishino et al., 1998). Similarly, the interference by the NH2 region in the in vitro branch migration (Figure 6(a)) and the RuvA-RuvB-Holliday junction tripartite complex formation (Figure 5) could be explained by the competition in the DNA binding between the NH2 region and the full-length RuvA. The inhibitory effects by domain III in the same assay (Figures 1(c), 5, and 6(b)) are interesting, because its functional role has not yet been well

characterized. The CD measurement con®rmed that the L170A mutation causes the conformational change of domain III, as revealed from the signi®cant decrease in the a-helicity (Figure 2). Thus, it is obvious that full inhibition requires the native conformation of domain III. The inhibitory effect of the isolated domain III on the RuvB ATPase activity is more intriguing, since this domain binds to RuvB (Nishino et al., 1998) and directly inhibits the ATPase activity (Figure 7(a)). RuvB is known to form a ring-like oligomeric structure around DNA (Stasiak et al., 1994). The ATP hydrolysis proceeds through a cyclic reaction, in which RuvB is sequentially converted between three distinct states, the ATP and ADP-bound forms, and the nucleotide-free form (Marrione & Cox, 1995). The highly mobile domain III, tethered by the ¯exible loop, is an ideal candidate as a regulator for this ATPase cycle. The addition of excess full-length RuvA inhibits RuvB ATPase activity (Figure 7(a)), although Marrione & Cox (1996) reported that RuvA stimulates RuvB ATPase activity when the ratio of RuvA and RuvB was between 8 and 6. However, their data also indicated that the further addition of RuvA slightly decreases the activity. Thus, the apparent discrepancy may be due to the amount of RuvA added to the reaction. The addition of synthetic Holliday junction DNA rescued this inhibitory effect, while the isolated domain III retained similar inhibitory effect (Figure 7(b)). This may be a manifestation that the ATPase cycle of RuvB is promoted by full-length RuvA and DNA, whereas the isolated domain III halts at a distinct state such as the ADP-bound form. Signal for interaction with DNA by RuvA may be transduced through the NH2 region to domain III, resulting in continuous ATP hydrolysis (Figure 8). In the absence of DNA, an excess amount of the full-length RuvA traps RuvB in a certain state, which the ATPase cycle halts. Electron microscopic analysis (Yu et al., 1997) revealed the morphology of the RuvAB-Holliday

derivative of pRA100, encoding wild-type RuvA, introduced into pET11a (Novagen). pRA301 and pRA302 encode the wild-type domain III and the mutant domain III (L170A) fused GST proteins, respectively. By PCR mutagenesis, unique BamHI and XhoI recognition sites were introduced into the regions corresponding to Val147-Leu-Thr149 and to the region 24 nucleotides downstream from the ruvA stop codon, respectively. The BamHI and XhoI fragments of the wild-type and L170A mutant were transferred to the corresponding sites of the GST fusion vector, pGEX-5X-2 (Pharmacia), giving pRA301 and pRA302, respectively. Bacteria were routinely cultured at 37  C in LB medium containing ampicillin if necessary. Ruv proteins The wild-type RuvA and RuvB proteins were prepared as described (Nishino et al., 1998). The NH2 region was puri®ed according to the previous protocol for fulllength RuvA puri®cation, except that ammonium sulfate precipitation was performed after cell lysis. The GSTdomain III fusion proteins puri®ed by glutathioneSepharose column chromatography (Pharmacia), were treated with factor Xa to cleave the linker between GST and domain III. The proteolytic products were subsequently separated by Superdex 75 gel ®ltration (Pharmacia). The domain III constructs contained three extra amino acid residues (Gly-Ile-Pro) N-terminal to Ser150 of RuvA. The protein concentration was determined using e280 values of 5240, 16,900, 3960, and 1280 MÀ1 cmÀ1 for RuvA, RuvB, the NH2 region, and domain III, respectively, which were obtained by the method described (Gill & von Hippel, 1989). CD measurement CD spectra of the wild-type and mutant RuvA domain III proteins in the far-UV and Soret regions were measured at 20  C with a Jasco J-720 spectrometer. The sample solutions contained a 1 mM amino acid concentration of the protein, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 10 % (v/v) glycerol. The path lengths for the measurements in the far-UV and Soret regions were 2 mm. The mean residue a-helical content was estimated with the deconvolution method of Yang et al. (1986). Crystalization and structure refinement of the NH2 region The NH2 region was crystallized in a solution containing 50 mM citrate-NaOH (pH 4.6), 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 % glycerol at 20  C by the microdialysis method. The crystals belong to the space group P21212, with unit Ê Ê Ê cell dimensions a  79.6 A, b  115.6 A, and c  34.8 A, and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit Ê (VM  2.5 A3/Da). Intensity data were collected by the use of MAC Science DIP2030 and synchrotron radiation on the beam line BL6B at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The collected data were indexed by the DENZO program, and each frame was scaled by the program SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993) without any sigma Ê cutoffs. Synchrotron data (15-2.5 A) exhibited 80 % Ê completeness, and thus data (15-3.5 A) collected with DIP2030 were merged to them for re®nements. The CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, 1994) was used for the molecular replacement and the subsequent re®nement of the protein

junction tripartite complex, where two RuvA tetramers sandwich the junction and are ¯anked on the junction arms by two RuvB hexameric rings. Adams & West (1995) reported that the addition of either RuvA antibodies or ADP abolishes branch migration, suggesting the requirement of a continuous RuvA-RuvB interaction for ef®cient branch migration. Furthermore, genetic (Sharples et al., 1990) and biochemical studies (Whitby et al., 1996; Eggleston et al., 1997; van Gool et al., 1998, 1999; Zerbib et al., 1998) suggested that the ternary complex carries RuvC to form a higher-order complex for ef®cient junction resolution. It is of great interest how the tetrameric RuvA protein interacts nonsymmetrically with the hexameric RuvB and how the RuvC activity is stimulated in the complex; the dynamic behavior of the RuvA-RuvB-Holliday junction tripartite complex may be a clue to solving the conundrum (Figure 8). A combination of biochemical, mutational, biophysical and structural studies have characterized the role of domain III in the regulation of RuvB ATPase activity. The regulation by a small mobile segment as described here was an unexpected ®nding. With further research, similar segments may be found in the other systems.

Materials and Methods
E. coli strains and plasmids E. coli strains BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) and XL1Blue (Stratagene) were used for the overexpression of the NH2 region and the GST-domain III fusion protein, respectively. E. coli strain AB1157(ruvA) (Bachmann, 1987) and its derivative HRS2000 (ÁruvA100::cmr (Ishioka et al., 1998)) were used for the UV sensitivity test. The plasmid pRA201 encodes the RuvA NH2 region, which was constructed by introducing a termination codon (TGA) at the Ser150 codon in ruvA. It is a

models. Throughout the entire re®nement process, the free R-factors were monitored as a guideline. For the manual improvement of the protein model, QUANTA version 1996 (MSI) was used. The electron density, corresponding to residues 141 to 149, was hardly discernible Ê even at the ®nal 2.5 A resolution electron density map, presumably due to structural disorder. The present model contains 280 amino acid residues and 22 water molecules. The Ramachandran map evaluated from the model by PROCHECK showed that 93.6 % of the residues are in the most favorable region, 6.4 % are in the favored region, and none is in the disallowed region, except for proline and glycine residues. Table 1 summarizes the data collection and re®nement. SAXS Measurements SAXS analyses of the full-length RuvA and the NH2 region were carried out at the solution scattering station (SAXS camera) installed at BL-10C (Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan) (Ueki et al., 1986; Kataoka et al., 1991). The sample-to-detector distance was about 90 cm for the measurements, as calibrated by meridional diffraction of dried chicken collagen. The wavelength of the X-ray was Ê set at 1.488 A. The volume of the sample cell was 50 ml with 15 mm thick quartz windows and a 1 mm X-ray path length. The temperature of the sample was controlled at 25  C by circulating temperature-controlled water. The protein concentrations were varied within a range of 1-10 mg/ml, and the measurement time for each scattering experiment was three minutes. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for ten minutes to remove any debris, although they were not ®ltered because RuvA is signi®cantly absorbed onto the membrane. Guinier plots showed no sign of higher-order association or aggregation in sample solutions. Analysis of SAXS data Data processing was carried out with personal computers. The radii of gyration, Rg, for RuvA, NH2 and two other standard proteins, bovine serum albumin and catalase, were obtained based on the Guinier approximation: IQ  I0 expÀR2 Q2a3  g

The formation of the protein-DNA complexes was analyzed by 5 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

ATPase activity A standard reaction mixture (20 ml) contained 3.0 mM RuvB, 20 mM triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.5) 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM ATP, [g-32P]ATP, and 0.01 % BSA. Samples were preincubated at 37  C for ®ve minutes, and the reactions were started by addition of RuvB. When indicated, the synthetic Holliday junction (3 mM) and the full-length RuvA (6 mM) were added to the reaction mixture. After 15 minutes of incubation, aliquots (2 ml) were taken and mixed with 2 ml of stop buffer (25 mM EDTA, 10 mM ADP). Samples (1 ml) were applied to polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck) and were developed in a solution containing 1 M formic acid and 0.4 M LiCl. The amounts of 32Pi and [g-32P]ATP in each spot were determined by using a phosphorimager (Fuji, BAS 5000), and percentages of hydrolyzed ATP were indicated as the relative ATPase activities.

where Q and I(0) are the momentum transfer and the intensity at a 0  scattering angle, respectively. Q is de®ned by Q  4psiny/l, where 2y and l are the scattering angle and the wavelength of the X-ray, respectively (Guinier & Fournet, 1955; Glatter & Kratky, 1982). The Rg value for each concentration was estimated independently. The experimental distance distribution functions, P(r), were evaluated using the program GNOM (Svergun et al., 1988), kindly provided by Dr Svergun. The P(r) functions for the crystal structures were calculated as histograms of the distance between each pair of atoms. Analyses of branch migration and DNA binding activities The ATP-dependent branch migration activity of the RuvA-RuvB complex was assayed by using the same synthetic Holliday junctions, as described (Hishida et al., 1999). The standard reaction mixtures (20 ml), containing
