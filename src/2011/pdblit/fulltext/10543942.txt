Division of Applied Life Sciences, The Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University Uji, Kyoto 611-0011, Japan The serpin conformational change by insertion of the reactive center loop into b-sheet A plays a central role in multiple physiological consequences such as serine proteinase inhibition, latency and serpinopathic polymerization. To study the dynamic mechanism for the loop insertion, a novel kinetic method was established utilizing the ovalbumin mutant R339T/A352R; the loop insertion progressed after the cleavage of P1-P1 0 (Arg352-Ser353) by trypsin was quenched at pH 8 and 0.5 8C, and different conformers were quantified by separation using ion-exchange HPLC. The apparent first-order rate constant k app determined for various R339T/A352R derivatives differing in conformational stability was greatly increased by lowering the pH. The pH-dependence of kapp indicated that the protonation of side-chain(s) with a pKa value of around 4.6 is a prerequisite for the loop insertion. The theoretical rate constant k for the protonated form calculated from kapp was highly variable, depending on the ovalbumin derivative; structural modifications that give increased mobility to helix F and the sheet-A half (s3A/s2A/s1A) resulted in a striking increase in the loop insertion rate constant k. The k values were determined at different temperatures for all the ovalbumin derivatives, and DH and DS values for the loop insertion reaction were determined according to the transition theory. The formation of the transition state was highly endothermic with minor entropy gain, requiring a DG larger than 18 kcal/mol, which can offset the hydrogen-bond cleavages between s3A and s5A. These results are consistent with the transition state with an opened sheet A and altered orientation of helix F.

The serpins, a family of serine proteinase inhibitors, are involved in diverse physiological functions and polymerization-related conformational diseases.1­3 Upon the exertion of canonical inhibition, they undergo a unique conformational change; after proteolytic cleavage at the P1-P1 0 site,

the reactive center loop (RCL) is inserted into the central b-sheet A.2,4 Such a conformational change also occurs without proteolytic cleavage during the formation of a latent form5­8 and of serpinopathic polymers. 3 The diverse consequences can be accounted for by the presence of a common structural transition state involved in the kinetic pathway for the loop insertion. Despite the accumulation of various classes of serpin crystal structures,9 a dynamic study for understanding the transition state has remained to be done. Ovalbumin, a major component of egg-white proteins, is included into the serpin super family, because of a close similarity in primary10,11 and tertiary structures12,13 and canonical loop cleavage at the P1-P1 0 site by a serine proteinase.14,15 The

Dynamic Mechanism for Serpin Loop Insertion

Figure 1. Stereo diagram of the structural modifications in intact ovalbumin. The mutated residues are colored brown and the counter residues (the side-chain for Trp148 and Ca atoms for Asn159) that interact with the target residues for mutation are colored green. Cys73 and Cys120 that form the native disulfide are shown with brown balls. The Figure is based on the X-ray crystallographic data of ovalbumin13 and was drawn using MOLSCRIPT34 and Raster3D.35

egg-white protein has neither the loop insertion mechanism nor inhibitory activity.14,15 By biochemical16 and crystallographic17 evidence, however, ovalbumin has been demonstrated to acquire the serpin loop insertion ability by replacement of the P14 residue (Arg339) with a less bulky residue.16,17 Previous indirect analyses for an ovalbumin mutant R339T have revealed that the loop insertion rate is quite slow with a first-order rate constant of 4.0! 10K3 sK1,18 which has raised the possibility for the quantitative kinetics of the serpin loop insertion by a conventional approach. Here, a novel kinetic method that enables the quantitative analysis of the loop insertion has been established utilizing the ovalbumin mutant R339T/A352R. Other ovalbumin mutants were created, so that the kinetic data can be directly

related to the dynamic mechanism of the loop insertion. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time on the basis of experimental evidence, a feasible transition conformation that is relevant to elucidation for the diverse consequences of serpin structural changes.

Results and Discussion
Rationale for the structural modifications The mutations employed all include A352R to confer the trypsin-susceptibility to the P1 site. The mutation R339T was used to enable the loop insertion for all the mutants except for A352R (Figure 1). The other mutations and modifications

411 are based on crystallographic data.17 The complete loop insertion requires the motion of s3A leaving from s5A (Figure 1); the disulfide bond (Cys73Cys120) that links helix E and the loop preceding helix D impedes the smooth motion of the N-terminal half of sheet A away from the C-terminal half of sheet A, which comprise b-strands of s3A/s2A/s1A and s6A/s5A, respectively.17 In inhibitory serpins, helix F is considered to assume a distorted19 or displaced conformation 20 during the loop insertion. In ovalbumin, some intramolecular interactions should prevent the smooth motion of helix F and its descending loop relative to sheet A;17 N159­O (loop descending helix F) receives a hydrogen bond from K290-NZ (s6A), and the side-chains of W148 (helix F) and R104 (s2A) make a strong stacking-like interaction (Figure 1). The effects of these interactions on the loop insertion were investigated using disulfide reduced R339T/A352R (SH-R339T/ A352R), K290T/R339T/A352R, and R104A/ R339T/A352R. Thermostabilities of the intact and cleaved ovalbumin mutants The intact and P1-P1 0 cleaved mutants were analyzed for their thermostability using differential scanning calorimetry. As shown in Figure 2 and Table 1, intact R339T/A352R with a thermal denaturation temperature (Tm) of 72.7 8C was converted by the P1-P1 0 cleavage to a much more stabilized form with a Tm of 87.6 8C. In contrast, the intact and cleaved A352R showed almost indistinguishable non-stabilized Tm values of about 73 8C, which reconfirmed the requirement of replacement of P14 Arg by a less bulky residue for the loop insertion.16­18 Other mutants and SHR339T/A352R all showed Tm increases of more than 12 deg. C after the P1-P1 0 cleavage, indicating the occurrence of the serpin loop insertion (Figure 2 and Table 1). When compared in the intact form, SHR339T/A352R, K290T/R339T/A352R, and R104A/ R339T/A352R all displayed a lower Tm than R339T/A352R, which reflects the more flexible nature of the N-terminal half of sheet A (s3A/ s2A/s1A) and helix F. Kinetic approaches for the loop insertion After the primary P1-P1 0 cleavage, ovalbumin undergoes a secondary P8-P7 cleavage by subtilisin21 in the pre-loop-inserted, but not post-loopinserted, state.16,18 Utilizing the differential P8-P7 resistant nature of the pre and post-loop-inserted conformers, the rate for the loop insertion was

Figure 3. Determination of the serpin loop-insertion rate for R339T/A352R. In (a), after the P1-P1 0 cleavage by trypsin at 25 8C and pH 8.0, R339T/A352R was incubated at the same temperature and pH for 0 (lane 1), 5 (lane 2), 15 (lane 3), 35 (lane 4), 75 (lane 5), and 115 minutes (lane 6). The sample was then exposed to subtilisin attack and analyzed by SDSPAGE as described in the text. The ovalbumin mutant in the intact form (lane 7), after incubation with trypsin for five minutes (lane 8) or with trypsin for 120 minutes (lane 9), or after direct attack (without pre-cleavage by trypsin) by subtilisin (lane 10) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the same way. In (b), after the same P1-P1 0 cleavage, R339T/A352R was incubated at pH 8.0 and 25 8C for 0 (profile c), 5 (profile d), 15 (profile e), 35 (profile f), 75 (profile g), and 115 minutes (profile h), and at pH 8.0 and 0.5 8C for 115 minutes (profile i), and then analyzed by the HPLC method. The intact (profile a) and purified, P1-P1 0 cleaved/loop-inserted (profile b) R339T/A352R were chromatographed in the same way. In (c), the ratio in (a) of the pre-loop-inserted form (P1-P1 0 /P7-P8 cleaved band intensity) relative to the sum of the preloop-inserted and post-loop-inserted form (P1-P1 0 cleaved band intensity) was plotted as a function of the loop insertion time (filled circles). The HPLC data in (b) are also plotted in the same way using the areas of peaks X and Y as the pre and post-loop-inserted forms, respectively (open circles). Both analyses yielded very similar fitting lines (continuous and dotted lines for HPLC and SDS-PAGE, respectively), but the accuracy was much better for the former analysis; the obtained first-order rate constant (kapp) was 9.0!10K3 minK1 (RZ0.998) for the HPLC analysis and 8.0!10K3 minK1 (RZ0.940) for the SDS-PAGE analysis.

analyzed for R339T/A352R. As shown in Figure 3(a), the P8-P7 resistant nature against subtilisin was confirmed for the P1-P1 0 cleaved, loop-inserted form of R339T/A352R (lane 9), while the protein state immediately after P1-P1 0 cleavage by trypsin, which corresponded to the pre-loopinserted state, underwent the P8-P7 cleavage by subtilisin (lane 1). The same P8-P7 accessible nature was also found upon the subtilisin attack against the intact form (lane 10), because of sequential subtilisin attack on the P1-P1 0 and P8-P7 bonds.16,18,19 Interestingly, after a brief P1-P1 0 cleavage of R339T/A352R by trypsin, the P8-P7 resistant loop-

inserted form increased with time on incubation at pH 8 and 25 8C (lanes 2­6). We found that increases in the loop-inserted form followed first-order kinetics with a t1/2 value of about 80 minutes (Figure 3(c)). As a more accurate approach, however, anionexchange HPLC was found to be useful (Figure 3(b)). When R339T/A352R immediately after the P1-P1 0 cleavage was analyzed by HPLC at pH 8 and 0.5 8C, almost all the molecules were eluted at 10.3 minutes as peak X (curve c). With time at pH 8 and 25 8C, peak Y with a retention time of 8.6 minutes increased (curves d­h). In contrast,

Figure 4. Susceptibility against subtilisin of the two forms of P1P1 0 cleaved R339T/A352R. For the isolation of peaks X and Y, R339T/A352R was incubated at 0.2 mg/ml and 25 8C for five minutes with 1.25 mg/ml of trypsin in 40 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) in a total volume of 1.0 ml. The P1-P1 0 cleaved R339T/A352R was kept under the same pH and temperature conditions for 0 (for peak X preparation) or 180 minutes (for peak Y preparation) and then applied to the HPLC column. After chromatography at 0.5 8C, the obtained peaks X and Y were immediately subjected to proteolysis by subtilisin. The conditions used were 25 8C for two minutes in the presence of 9.5 mg/ml (lanes 2 and 7), 19.0 mg/ml (lanes 3 and 8), and 38.0 mg/ml (lanes 4 and 9) of subtilisin or absence of the protease (lanes 1 and 6), before termination of the proteolysis in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described in the text. Lanes 1­4 and 5­8 are the electrophoresis patterns for peaks Y and X, respectively. The purified forms of intact (lane 9), P1-P1 0 -cleaved (lane 10), and P1-P1 0 /P8-P7-cleaved (lane 11) R339T/A352R were also electrophoresed as control.

A352R stayed as P1-P1 0 -cleaved, non-loop-inserted form during the same incubation (data not shown). Practical absence of X to Y conversion during 15 minutes of HPLC was confirmed by the observation that cleaved R339T/A352R stayed as peak X during 115 minutes at pH 8 and 0.5 8C (curve i). To investigate the conformational state of ovalbumin at different retention times on HPLC, we analyzed the susceptibility to subtilisin of peaks X and Y. As shown in Figure 4, peaks X and Y were identified by SDS-PAGE as pre and post-loopinserted conformers, respectively; the proteins from peaks X and Y were, respectively, susceptible and resistant to P8-P7 cleavage by subtilisin. Peak X receives P8-P7 cleavage by subtilisin (lanes 6­8), indicating a non-loop-inserted state of the P1-P1 0 cleaved form. In contrast, peak Y displays resistance against P8-P7 cleavage by subtilisin (lanes 2­5). Instead, peak Y received a new cleavage at a high subtilisin condition, yielding a 30 kDa fragment. The new cleavage, along with the resistance to P8-P7 cleavage indicates that peak Y corresponds to the fully loop-inserted form of ovalbumin. We find that the N-terminal sequence of the 30 kDa fragment is Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Asp-Ile-Leu-, which corresponds to an internal sequence (Ser81 to Lue87) of helix D (unpublished data). The unique cleavage by subtilisin in the loop-inserted form probably reflects a disordered conformation of the preceding loop of helix D.17 The same retention time of peak Y as the purified, P1-P1 0 cleaved R339T/A352R (Figure 3(b)) reinforces its loop-inserted conformation. The X to Y conversion followed first-order kinetics with much better accuracy than in the SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 3(c)). The successful analysis by HPLC depended on the clear separation of the different conformers and on the practical absence of loop insertion at pH 8 and 0.5 8C. These characteristics are probably accounted for by exposure of some of non-protonated RCL residues (E340, E346, and D350) at near neutral pH in the

P1-P1 0 cleaved/pre-loop-inserted conformer but not in the intact or loop-inserted conformer. We confirm that the kapp value for P1-P1 0 cleaved R339T depends highly on pH as in R339T/A352R (unpublished data), which indicates that the pH

After the P1-P1 0 cleavage by trypsin at 25 8C and pH 8.0 for five minutes, R339T/A352R was incubated at a shifted temperature and pH for progress of the loop insertion. After termination of the loop insertion, the R339T/A352R sample was analyzed by Mono-Q column chromatography at pH 8.0 and 0.5 8C. From the areas of peaks X and Y, the pre and post-loop-inserted conformers were estimated and the apparent first-order rate constant kapp was determined as in Figure 3(c). The kapp values at 0.5 8C (filled squares), 10 8C (open squares), 20 8C (filled circles), 25 8C (open circles), 30 8C (filled triangles), and 35 8C (open triangles) were plotted as a function of pH. The kapp data at all the temperatures were fitted well to equation (2), as shown by the continuous curves and obtained pKa values were within a narrow range (pH 4.5­4.8) with an average value of 4.6G0.053 (S.E.), which indicates the practical absence of a temperature effect on the pKa value.

Figure 6. Temperature and pH dependence of the loop insertion rate for various ovalbumin mutants. The loop insertion rates (a) at 25 8C and various pH values and (b) at pH 5.8 and various temperatures were determined for ovalbumin mutants (circles, R339T/A352R; inverted triangles, K290T/R339T/A352R; triangles, R104A/R339T/A352R; squares, SH-R339T/A352R). In (a), the kapp data for the mutants were fitted well to equation (2), as shown by the continuous curves and also displayed narrow pKa values (pH 4.5­4.6) with an average value of 4.6G0.028 (S.E.). For SHR339T/A352R with less stability against acid denaturation,20 the kapp data were not reproducible at a pH lower than 5.3; the curve was the fitted one for the data at a pH higher than 5.3 using equation (2) and pKa value of 4.6. In (b), the k values were obtained using kapp data at pH 5.8 and equation (2).

dependence of kapp should not be accounted for by the mutation A352R. Effects of pH and temperature on the loop insertion rate As a prerequisite for a reliable analysis for the effects of pH and temperature on the loop insertion kinetics, we determined the apparent first-order rate constant kapp for R339T/A352R at different combinations of pH and temperature. After the P1-P1 0 cleavage by trypsin at 25 8C and pH 8.0 for five minutes, R339T/A352R was incubated at a shifted temperature and pH for progress of the loop insertion. After termination of the loop insertion at pH 8.0 and 0.5 8C, the R339T/A352R sample was analyzed by Mono-Q column chromatography under the same pH and temperature conditions. From the areas of peaks X and Y, the pre and postloop-inserted conformers were estimated and the apparent first-order rate constant kapp was determined as in Figure 3(c). As displayed in Figure 5, at all the loop insertion temperatures, the loop insertion rate was strikingly accelerated by lowering pH; the pH-dependent profiles were consistent with sigmoid curves. When the protonation of an amino acid residue(s) in cleaved R339T/A352R is assumed to be a pre-requisite for the subsequent insertion of the loop, the overall pathway can be shown by the scheme: ÿ/ ÿ X C HC% X K H ÿ ÿ Y
Ka k

where X and XKH represent, respectively, the nonprotonated and protonated forms of the P1-P1 0 cleaved, pre-loop-inserted conformer. Y is the fully loop-inserted conformer. Ka and k represent the dissociation constant of XKH into X and HC, and the true first-order rate constant of the loop insertion, respectively. When the dissociation is in a rapid equilibrium, the apparent first-order rate constant kapp can be shown as follows: kapp Z k=f1 C 10ðpHKpKa Þ g (2)

(1)

The curves in Figure 5 are the fitted ones for the kapp data using equation (2). The obtained pKa values were in a narrow range (pH 4.5­4.8) with an average value of 4.6G0.053 (S.E.) for different temperatures, indicating the practical absence of the effect of temperature on the pKa value. The pHdependent nature reveals that the slow loop insertion rate, estimated in earlier studies,16 can be accounted for by the use of a near neutral pH condition. At a pH value for the loop insertion lower than 3.8, the chromatographic data were not reproducible, probably because of acid denaturation of ovalbumin.22 The loop insertion rate was strikingly accelerated by lowering the pH for all the mutants as well (Figure 6(a)). The curves in Figure 6(a) are the fitted ones for the kapp data using equation (2). The obtained pKa values were again in a narrow range, with an average value of 4.6 for different mutants. The true rate constant k obtained by the curve fitting analysis using equation (2) and pKaZ4.6 was

415 entropy gains at 25 8C (TDS) resulted in DG (the free energy change for the formation of the transition state) with a value larger than 18 kcal/mol for either mutant. Correlation between the conformational stability and kinetic data Data in Table 1 also indicate that the conformational stability of TmKI is directly related to DG with an apparent linear equation: DGZ0.2TmKIC 5.1 (Figure 7). By extrapolation of this empirical equation, the DG  to Tm KI relation may be predicted for other inhibitory serpins. Indeed, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 with a TmKI value of 50.2 8C23 has a k value of 81 sK1 or 88 sK1,24 which corresponds to a DG of 14.8 kcal/mol or 14.9 kcal/mol at 25 8C, well consistent with the empirical equation. Most of the inhibitory serpins have a TmKI value ranging from 50 8C to 60 8C,23,25 suggesting a DG value of 15 kcal/mol to 17 kcal/ mol at 25 8C. For progress of the loop insertion, the main-chain hydrogen bonds between s3A and s5A have to be cleaved.20 The DG values correspond to the free energy that can offset the cleavage of all the nine hydrogen bonds between strands s3A and s5A, if a value of 1.6 kcal/mol is assumed for the free energy of a protein hydrogen bond.26

Figure 7. Correlation of DG and the thermal denaturation temperature of the intact serpin (TmKI). For the ovalbumin mutants (filled circles: 1, R339T/A352R; 2, K290T/R339T/A352R; 3, R104A/R339T/A352R; 4, SHR339T/A352R), DG values were plotted as a function of TmKI (the thermal denaturation temperature of intact ovalbumin) according to the data in Table 1. The data were fitted well (RZ0.99) to the continuous line corresponding to the equation DGZ0.2TmKIC5.1. The data shown in open circles are from previous publications about plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.22 This inhibitory serpin with a TmKI value of 50.2 8C21 undergoes the serpin conformational transition after the cleavage by trypsin with a first-order rate constant of 81 sK1 or 88 sK1 as revealed by fluorescence energy transfer analysis.22 These rate constants correspond to a DG of 14.8 kcal/mol and 14.9 kcal/mol at 25 8C, according to equation (3), well consistent with the continuous line.

Conclusion
The quantitative kinetics for the serpin loop insertion, done for the first time in the present study, provide important insights into the conformation of the transition state. The native disulfide bond Cys73­Cys120 that links helix E and the loop preceding helix D impedes the smooth motion of the N-terminal half of sheet A (s3A/s2A/s1A) away from the C-terminal half of sheet A (s6A/s5A) by tightening a cushion-like motion of the former helix.17 The striking increase in the loop insertion rate with the disulfide reduction along with the requirement of a large DG value for the formation of the transition state supports an opened conformation between strands 3A and 5A. An increased loop insertion rate (Table 1) for K290T/R339T/ A352R, in which a hydrogen bond between s6A and the descending loop of helix F is abolished, also supports the opened sheet A conformation. The side-chains of W148 (helix F) and R104 (strand 2A) make a strong stacking-like interaction, thereby handicapping the motion of helix F relative to s2A.17 The highly accelerated rate in R104A/ R339T/A352R stresses the participation of the altered orientation of helix F relative to s2A for the formation of the transition state; in the same context as a1-antitrypsin, filling a cavity around G117 (counterpart of R104 of ovalbumin) with a bulkier residue, which confers increased stability on the inhibitor, results in decelerated loop insertion and in decreased inhibitory activity. 27 Taken together, as a feasible conformation of the transition

6.7-fold in SH-R339T/A352R, 3.7-fold in R104A/ R339T/A352R and 1.5-fold in K290T/R339T/ A352R as compared to the value in R339T/A352R (Table 1). To study the kinetic mechanism in more detail, we analyzed the temperature dependence of the loop insertion rate, utilizing the conventional transition state theory shown by the equation: lnðk=TÞ Z lnðkB =hÞ C DS =R K DH =RT (3)

where T, R, kB, and h represent the absolute temperature, the molar gas constant, the Boltzmann constant, and the Plank constant, respectively. DH and DS are the changes in enthalpy and entropy upon conversion into the transition state. Because of the absence of temperature dependence on the pKa value as confirmed for R339T/A352R (Figure 5), the rate constant k was determined using the kapp value at pH 5.8, pKaZ4.6, and equation (2). Figure 6(b) demonstrates that the plot of ln(k/T) versus 1/T follows a linear relation for either ovalbumin. The DH and DS values determined, respectively, from the slope and the intersection on the ordinate of the line are summarized in Table 1. One of the most important findings was that the formation of the transition state is a highly endothermic process with DH values larger than 18 kcal/mol. The small

416 state, we propose a structural model that includes cleaved hydrogen bonds between strands s3A and s5A, and a modulated orientation of helix F relative to sheet A. Such a conformation for the transition state appears similar to the previously hypothesized intermediate form C with a partially displaced helix F.20 Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a1-antitrypsin, and antithrombin are transformed into a latent form in which intact RCL is inserted into sheet A.5­8 The occurrence of the loop insertion without the cleavage of the P1-P1 0 bond is also known for the serpinopathic polymer formation.3 The rates for the formation of latent28 and polymerized29 forms are significantly affected by substitution of amino acid residues on helix F. Our proposed transition state model with an opened sheet A conformation and modulated orientation of helix F may therefore be commonly implicated for the diverse serpin consequences, so that RCL in either an intact, cleaved, or cleaved/ proteinase-loaded state can be competent for the subsequent conformational change by the insertion into sheet A.

Synthesized primer oligonucleotides for the mutations, supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan), were as follows: for R339T

SH-R339T/A352R was prepared by incubation with 15 mM dithiothreitol as described.30 For the preparation of the P1-P1 0 cleaved forms, ovalbumin mutants were incubated at 0.2 mg/ml with 125 ng/ml of trypsin in 40 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 25 8C for 30 minutes. The proteolysis was terminated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1.5 mM and the cleaved proteins were purified using an anionexchange column (Mono Q 5/5, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) as described.17,18 The protein concentration was estimated from the absorption at 280 nm by using E1% Z 7:12.31 The cleavage at the P1-P1 0 site was 1 cm confirmed by molecular size determination and N-terminal sequence analysis; for all the ovalbumin mutants, the generated large fragments displayed 39 kDa by SDS-PAGE and newly generated N-terminal sequence by the proteolysis was Ser-Val-Ser-Glu-GluPhe-, which corresponded to the sequence Ser353 to Phe358 of ovalbumin. Subtilisin Carlsberg of Bacillus licheniformis (protease type VIII), trypsin (diphenyl carbamyl chloride-treated trypsin), and Na-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The protease activity determined using the synthetic substrate32 was 104 units/mg of trypsin. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was obtained from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan) and other chemicals were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Differential scanning calorimetry The thermostabilities of the intact and cleaved ovalbumin mutants were analyzed with a microcalorimeter (MCS-DSC, MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The protein samples were passed through a prepacked Sephadex column (NAP-5, NAP-10 or NAP-25, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and degassed for ten minutes under reduced pressure prior to the calorimetric analysis.17,33 The temperature scanning was performed at 1 deg. C/minute from 25 8C to 100 8C. Heat capacity, Cp, was plotted after subtraction of the data for the blank experiment without protein. Kinetic analyses for the conformational change

The progress of the conformational change by loop insertion was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC. For the SDS-PAGE analysis, the P1-P1 0 bond of R339T/A352R was completely cleaved by incubation at 0.2 mg/ml and 25 8C in 40 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) for five minutes with 1.2 mg/ml of trypsin, which corresponded to 0.12 units/ml. The sample was allowed to stand for progress of the loop insertion at the same temperature and pH for various times and then exposed to attack by 9 mg/ml of subtilisin for 2.0 minutes before termination of the proteolysis in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The proteolyzed R339T/A352R was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. The band intensities were estimated with the software Scion Image for Windows, version Beta 4.0.2 (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). For HPLC analyses, after the P1-P1 0 cleavage by trypsin in the same way, the R339T/A352R sample was diluted fivefold with 40 mM Tris­HCl buffer at pH 8.0 and 25 8C, and incubated for progress of the loop insertion at the same temperature for various times. After termination of the loop insertion by fivefold dilution with the same buffer at 0.5 8C, the sample was applied to a Mono-Q HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ)

that had been equilibrated at 0.5 8C with 0.15 M Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and then eluted with a linear 25 mM­150 mM NaCl gradient in ten minutes at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/minute under the same pH and temperature conditions. Effects of pH and temperature on loop insertion kinetics The apparent first-order rate constant k app for R339T/A352R at different combinations of pH and temperature was determined by the HPLC procedure. After the P1-P1 0 cleavage by trypsin at 25 8C and pH 8.0 for five minutes, R339T/A352R was incubated at a shifted temperature and pH for progress of the loop insertion. The shift was attained by fivefold dilution of the cleaved ovalbumin with 40 mM buffer at various combinations of temperature and pH (sodium acetate for pH 3.8­5.8; sodium phosphate for pH 6.2­7.3; Tris­HCl for pH 8.0) and by subsequent incubation for various times (at least four time-points) at the same temperature and pH. After termination of the loop insertion by fivefold dilution of ovalbumin with 40 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 0.5 8C, the R339T/A352R sample was analyzed by Mono-Q column chromatography at pH 8.0 and 0.5 8C in the same way. From the areas of peaks X and Y, the pre and post-loop-inserted conformers were estimated and the apparent first-order rate constant kapp was determined. We confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography that no polymerization was induced in the intact and cleaved ovalbumin states under the pH conditions employed. The pH dependence of the loop insertion rate for different ovalbumin mutants was determined at a fixed temperature of 25 8C in the same way. The first-order rate constant k for the ovalbumin mutants was also determined at various temperatures from 0.5 to 35 8C. The actual time-span employed for progress of the loop insertion at 25 8C (see Figure 6(a)) ranged from several seconds (t1/2Zfour seconds for R104A/R339T/A352R at pH 3.8) to a few hours (t1/2Z1.3 hours for R339T/A352R at pH 8.0); for the former mutant the actual rate at pH 3.8 and 35 8C should be too fast to be measured accurately by the manual mixing procedure and for the latter mutant the rate should be too slow at pH 8.0 and 0.5 8C to allow the loop insertion without protein deterioration. The kapp values were therefore determined for all the mutants at pH 5.8, at which the loop insertion progresses with a reasonable time-span at all the employed temperatures, and then k values were calculated using equation (2) and pKaZ4.6. The k values for the mutants were plotted according to equation (3).
