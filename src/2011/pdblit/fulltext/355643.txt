Because the chemically derived amino acid sequence for yeast hexokinase B is not known, a skeletal model of the 51,000 molecular weight monomer (complexed with the inhibitor, o-toluoylglucosamine) was built from a 2.5 A resolution electron density map as a first step in an attempt to derive an approximate amino acid sequence, as well as accurate atomic co-ordinates, by crystallographic refinement. The electron density map used in this study was improved over that previously reported (Steitz et al., 1976) by the inclusion of an additional and excellent heavy atom derivative in the phasing, by extension of the resolution to 2.5 8, and by improvements in the data processing and heavy atom refinement. Although side-chain identities were surmised for most residues from the shape of the electron density, it is unlikely that more than one-fourth of the residues are crystal disorder and inaccurate phases. correct at this stage due to inherent The model contains only 2909 of the approximately 3596 non-hydrogen atoms expected from the amino acid composition, yet it provides an adequate starting point for crystallographic refinement of the amino acid sequence and the coordinates. The model confirms the overall path of the polypeptide backbone presented earlier (Fletterick et al., 1975) but differs most notably in that a short segment of chain thought to be in extended conformation is now seen to be an a-helix. This change eliminates the only left-handed /3-chain-strand-/l-chain supersecondary structure in our model. Also, the 13 a-helices in hexokinase that are in close contact with each other cross pairwise at angles of about lo", 40" to 60°, and 80" to 90". The sugar moiety of the inhibitor, o-toluoylglucosamine, binds to hexokinase in the C-l chair equatorial conformation with the 1-hydroxyl axial (a-anomer). between protein side-chains and both the 4-hydroxyl and Specific interactions 3-hydroxyl groups can be seen but it is not clear in this map whether there might also be interactions with the l- and 6-hydroxyl groups.

1. Introduction
Crystallographic structural studies on the yeast hexokinase B (EC 2.7.1 .l) monomer complexed with the inhibitor OTGt have previously been presented in terms of an a-carbon backbone which portrays the overall polypeptide fold and the molecular shape (Fletterick et al., 1975; Steitz et al., 1976). However, in order to understand the

structural basis for this enzyme's catalytic mechanism and its control, it is necessary to have a very precise knowledge of the positions of all the protein atoms. Since there is virtually no chemical amino acid sequence available for hexokinase, we are confronted with a question which has faced protein crystallographers before (Kendrew et al., 1961; Lipscomb et al., 1969; Blundell & Johnson, 1976), and is now a common problem; namely, how far can crystallographic techniques go towards providing an amino acid sequence! To put it another way, what is the minimum amount of chemical information required for a complete structure? The ease and accuracy with which one can identify amino acid side-chains from an electron density map depends on the resolution to which the data are measured, the degree of structural disorder in the crystal, and the quality of the phasing. Lattice disorder present to varying extents in all protein crystals eliminates the highest resolution diffra,ction intensities and motion of many side-chains on the surface of the molecule makes these groups partially or totally invisible. In addition, the phases derived from the multiple isomorphous replacement technique are often nearly random at high resolution so that an electron density map calculated using high resolution data may have a lower apparent resolution. There have been several previous attempts to ascertain the amino acid sequence from X-ray diffractiondata alone, including myoglobin (Kendrew et al., 1961), carboxypeptidase (Lipscomb et al., 1969), thermolysin (Matthews et al., 1972), and rubredoxin (Watenpaugh et al., 1973). In these cases, the amino acid sequence has been estimated from a high quality electron density map at 2.3 or 2.0 A resolution. A comparison of the sequences produced in this way with chemically derived sequences, which were subsequently determined, show that these X-ray sequences were 50 to SO04 correct. However, in the case of yeast hexokinase, and indeed most other proteins, the crystal diffraction pattern does not extend to as high a resolution, and MIR phases cannot be obtained beyond 2.5 A resolution. Furthermore, hexokinase is nearly ten times as large as rubredoxin. What sequence informa,tion can be obtained in this less favorable, though more common, situation? We report here a 2.5 A resolution electron density map derived from the BIII crystal form from which we built a skeletal model including many amino acid sidechains. It is not likely that more than 25 to 30% of the protein side-chains have been correctly identified from inspection of this map since both the resolution and the quality of the phasing is worse than was possible with, for example, carboxypeptidase A. Despite the errors in residue identification, this model has proved to be accurate enough to initiate a crystallographic co-ordinate refinement, which is described in the following paper (Anderson et al., 1978a). We have found that refinement of thisincomplete model has resulted in a great improvement in both the atomic co-ordinates and number of residues correctly identified, and has led to a sequence that is probably 60 to 70% correct.

2. Methods
Yeast hexokinase B was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., and was crystallized by dialysis of a 1 y0 solution of enzyme against 2-O to 2.2 M-potassium phosphate and 0.4 mMOTG at pH 7-O. The BIII crystals have unit cell parameters of a = 166.5, b = 59.2, c = 58.5 A, with a 51,000 molecular weight monomer in the asymmetric unit of space group P212,2,. In addition to the heavy atom derivatives used previously in the 2-7 if resolution study (Steitz et al., 1976), a potassium osmiate derivative was made by soaking crystals for

4 h in 20 mM-K,0sC4 and the standard solution which consisted of 0.4 mM-0-tOlUOylglucosamine, 70% saturated ammonium sulfate, and 0.04 M-phosphate, pH 7.0. This derivative was sufficiently isomorphous that it was useful to 2.5 A resolution as were the dimercury acetate and methyl mercury derivatives. The data were measured on a modified Picker diffractometer which was interfaced to a PDPj8 computer by Dr Harold W. Wyckoff. Peak intensities were measured by summing the highest 4 measurements of a limited omega step scan (Wyckoff et al., 1967). Background was measured at non-integral lattice points as a function of 28. Transmission curves were collected as a function of 4 for a strong reflection at 18.2" in 20. A typical 2.5 A data set required 15 crystals collected in shells of sin e/x. A set of low resolution reflections was collected for each crystal and used to obtain a preliminary scale factor for merging the data from each of the crystals. For the data extending to 2.7 A resolution, crystals were exposed until standard reflections fell by 10% from the initial intensity and no decay correction was applied. For the 2.7 to 2.5 A resolution data, however, 10 to 15 standard reflections distributed between 5 and 2.5 if resolution were remeasured every 200 reflections, and these were used to correct for decay of intensities due to radiation damage to the crystals. The background corrected standards were normalized to unity and tit with the following equation using least-squares weighted by counting statistics as suggested by Dr Harold W. Wyckoff. I(t, r) = (A + Bt + Ct2)exp(Dtv), where

Agreement of the standards with a function of this form was quite good. For a typical crystal containing 7 sets of 11 standards, the average sample variance of the normalized reflections to the decay function was 0*0006. Systematic errors in the amplitude differences between parent and derivative data sets as a function of JL, Ic, and 1 were noted to be as high as 3% of the average amplitudes. These systematic differences were reduced by calculating scale factors between the derivatives and the parent in rectangular blocks containing about 100 reflections. The scale factors were weighted by: 2/(number in block/average amplitude in block) or by 1.0, whichever was smaller, to prevent biasing of the scale due to too few reflections in a block. Heavy atom parameters were refined using alternate cycles of phasing and least-squares refinement with a reduced data set containing 1 out of every 4 reflections as described previously (Steitz et al., 1976). Refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The 455 residue model was built at 2 cm/A scale in a Richards optical comparator with a vertical mirror. The model was constructed from Watson-Kendrew skeletal parts (Cambridge Tool Co.) and was built in 3 separate pieces to allow all of the residues to be reached easily. A new method of co-ordinate measurement was developed which proved to be both fast and accurate. A sheet of 5 mil acetate was taped to the back of the mirror. By sitting behind the mirror and looking at the model, one can superimpose the image of one's pupil with an atom and draw a dot on the plastic. Meanwhile a second person standing on the model side of the mirror calls out the distances of the atom to the mirror. This information is written next to the dot by the first person. Later the plastic can be laid down on graph paper to obtain the other 2 co-ordinates. The co-ordinates of approx. 2000 protein atoms were measured in a few days with an average reproducibility of 0.2 A. Only the carbonyl oxygen and alpha carbon atom positions of the peptide backbone were measured. The positions of the other backbone atoms were calculated by interfrom these. Systematic errors in the co-ordinates such as translation along an polation axis, expansion, or deformation due to a bent mirror were removed by the method of Fletterick & Wyckoff (1975). This method consisted of computing electron density gradients at each of the atoms in the MIR map. These gradients were used to find an overall linear transformation to improve overlap of the model and map. The largest systematic error of this kind was a 0.4 cm (0.2 A) translation parallel to the mirror.

Bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles were idealized using the computer program REFINE2 written by Hermans & McQueen (1974). This was done to reduce errors in measuring co-ordinates and bent model parts. This program proved more satisfactory than Diamond's model building program (Diamond, 1966) since it was faster, corrected incorrect enantiomorphs in a conservative manner and most importantly did not distort the positions of correctly placed atoms to accommodate occasional extreme errors in atomic positions. The Hermans and McQueen program does not calculate the idealized co-ordinates in one step, but instead passes through the co-ordinates many times, moving them slightly each time. It is possible to adjust the relative weights of the stereochemical restraints and the restraint which keeps the new atom positions close to their initial, or "target" position. These weights may be varied exponentially from the first pass to the last pass. Ten passes weights: were executed using the following Target Pass 1 Pass 10 1 1 Bond length 1 10 Bond angle 1 10 Dihedral 1 10

3. Results
The statistics from the heavy atom refinement are given in Table 1. The major factor in the improvement of the phases was the addition of the osmiate derivative, not only because it is as isomorphous as the best mercury derivative, but also because all of its five sites are in different locations than the mercury sites. The three mercury derivatives, on the other hand, had three sites in common but with different relative occupancies. Anisotropic temperature factors and block scaling made a small but positive improvement to the heavy atom refinement statistics. Block scaling was useful because there is an average of 15 crystals in each 26 A set of 20,000 reflections and not all systematic errors had been successfully eliminated. For example, radiation decay of each of these crystals caused systematic errors in the scale factors between the crystals. A portion of the electron density map containing a long helix is shown in Figure 1 with a skeletal model superimposed. While the map is easily interpretable in most areas of regular secondary structure such as this, in other areas the map is poorer; the density of the main-chain is broken in several places and two loops of "random coil" on the outside of the protein are visible at less than half the expected height.

Often carbonyl oxygens of the backbone peptides are visible, and some side-chain density appears for about 80% of the residues. For about 25 to 30% of the residues the side-chain density was best accounted for by only one of the amino acid side-chains, whereas for the majority of residues there were two or three side-chain possibilities. In places where it was obvious that a sidechain existed but it was not clear what its identity might be, aliphatic side-chains of two, three, or four carbons were inserted and called Gam, Del, and Eps, respectively. This was done because preliminary refinement on a previous model had indicated that it was preferable to insert atoms into the side-chain density wherever possible than to leave them out. The previous model, which contained only 2536 of the 3596 atoms expected from the amino acid analysis, did not account for enough of the scattering

The second model built with a more generous interpretation of the density contained 2944 atoms and was thus missing 1.2 atoms per residue. A comparison between the amino acid composition of our model built from the MIR map and the chemically determined amino acid composition (Schmidt & Colowick, 1973) is given in Table 2. It is clear that we have overestimated the number of small side-chains and underestimated the number of large side-chains.

The amino acid composition of hexokinase (Schmidt 8s Colowick, 1973) and of the hexokinase model. The crystallized enzyme is missing 11 residues from the N-terminus (Steitz et al., 1976). The identity of these 11 residues is known (Schmidt & Colowick, 1973) and they have been subtracted from the amino acid analysis. Several other residues at the N- and/or C-termini are probably disordered in the electron density map, so our initial model contained only 455 residues while the intact enzyme has about 470 residues, as determined from the amino acid composition. t Schmidt & Colowick (1973).

The fit of a model of the substrate analog, OTG, whose structure is given in Figure 2, into the electron density map is shown in Figures 3 and 4. The sugar moiety appears to be in the C-l equatorial conformation with the 1-hydroxyl being axial (LXanomer). It can be seen in this Figure that electron densities corresponding to protein side-chains are interacting with density due to the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups of the sugar.

of Fletterick & Wyckoff (1975). Then stereochemical errors were removed by idealization of bond length and angles (Hermans & McQueen, 1974). Structure factors for reflections between 8 A and 2.5 L% resolution were calculated from the idealized co-ordinates and were used to determine an overall temperature factor of 25 A2. The crystallographic R factor was 0.48. The idealized co-ordinates of the polypeptide backbone, but without the side-chain residues, were deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank in 1976 (identification code IYHK).

4. Discussion
The phases used in this study to calculate the 2.5 A resolution electron density map were improved over those used previously (Fletterick et al, 1975; Steitz et al., 1976) in several ways : (1) inclusion of a potassium osmiate derivative, (2) extension of the data from 2.7 A to 2.5 A resolution, (3) block scaling of derivative data to the parent data to reduce systematic scaling errors, (4) use of anisotropic heavy atom temperature factors in the refinement. The average figure of merit for data out to 2.7 L%resolution increased from a value of 0.65 in the previous study (Fletterick et al., 1975) to 0.74 in this work. Furthermore, the map reported here is considerably more accurate than the one obtained by averaging the monomer and dimer electron density maps

view

(Fletterick & Steitz, 1976; Steitz et al., 1976). The earlier map had more breaks in the backbone electron density and it was not possible to correctly orient peptide backbone carbonyl groups of polypeptide chain which were not involved in regular secondary structure. If the model built from this earlier map were refined, it would have converged to the true structure much more slowly than the later model, if at all. The overall course of the polypeptide backbone (Figures 5 and 6) is the same as that derived from earlier electron density maps (Fletterick et aE., 1975; Steitz et al., 1976), although a few residues have been added or deleted throughout the cha,in. The most significant alteration involves the three parallel vertical strands on the right-hand side of Figures 5 and 6. These strands were thought to form a small, three-stranded p-sheet on the basis of the previous maps. In particular the chain from about 330 to 340 which was earlier thought to be in an extended conformation is seen in the current electron density map to be in an u-helical conformation. The other two strands, residues 341 to 348 and 301 to 310, can form perhaps two hydrogen bonds between peptide backbone in the /3-conformation. The difficulties that were encountered in the earlier interpretation were probably associated with the high degree of disorder exhibited by these surface chains and the lower accuracy of the earlier maps. This change in our interpretation of the current electron density map is particularly significant since the three-stranded sheet as formerly presented appeared to be one of the two exceptions to the generalization (Richardson, 1976; Sternberg & Thornton

1976) that all supersecondary structures that consist of two parellel/3+trands connected by a chain are right-handed. Since this region no longer contains two parallel ,%strands, it is no longer relevant to these generalizations. The arrangement of secondary structure is shown schematically in Figure 6. The molecule folds into two lobes separated by a deep cleft. The right-hand lobe in Figure 6 consists of nine u-helices and a F-sheet. The other lobe consists of a P-pleated sheet flanked by cc-helices. Pairs of a-helices in hexokinase that are interacting appear to have their helix axes inchned at one of three relatively discrete angles. Two u-helices were defined to be interacting if side-chains in these u-helices were in contact. The 13 pairs of interacting a-helices are passing each other at angles of lo", 40 to 60", or 80 to 90" (Fig. 7). Chothia et al. (197'7) have suggested that cr-helices interact with each other at these three relatively discrete angles because only at these angles can the "ridges" due to side-chains of one helix efficiently pack into the "grooves" between side-chains in the other helix.

Since the crystals used in this study were grown in the presence of a competitiva inhibitor of glucose, o-toluoylglucosamine, it was possible to directly examine the sugar and its interaction with the protein. The sugar moiety appears to be in the C-l chair equatorial conformation with the I-hydroxyl axial. Although specific interactions between protein side-chains and both the 4-hydroxyl and 3-hydroxyl can be seen, it is not apparent from this map what the identities of these residues are or whether there might also be interactions of protein side-chains with the 6-hydroxyl and l-hydroxyl of the sugar. A more detailed description of this interaction, obtained from crystallographic refinement of the enzyme and sugar, will be reported in a subsequent, paper (Anderson et al., 19786). Since we have built side-chains into our model without knowledge of a chemically derived amino acid sequence, it is not likely that more than one-quarter to one-third of our identifications are in fact correct at this stage. This is seen from a comparison of the X-ray derived amino acid composition and the chemical composition (Table Z), from a comparison of two chemically sequenced peptides with this X-ray sequence (Anderson et ccl., 1978a), and from the number of residues whose identity seemed to be obvious from the electron density map. The model contains too many short residues such as alanine and too few long residues such as arginine. This results from the fact of the side-chain that strong electron density is present for only about two-thirds

atoms so that only 2909 of the expected 3596 non-hydrogen atoms could be located in this first model. There could be several reasons why these atoms are missing from the map. Errors in the MIR phases could have lowered the apparent resolution of the map, disconnecting side-chain density from the backbone, and reducing density in many areas. In addition, a partial or total disorder of some side-chains on the surface of the molecule could have made the density due to these atoms not visible in the map. This disorder is reflected in the overall temperature factor which has been computed to be 25 A2. Since this value was calculated from the more ordered atoms found in the MIR map, it is probably an underestimate. There have been numerous occasions in the past when an X-ray sequence was obtained from an MIR electron density map (Kendrew et al., 1961; Lipscomb et al., 1969; Colman et al., 1972). Each of these cases was more favorable than the current hexokinase map because these crystals had overall temperature factors in the 10 to 15 A2 range and the MIR maps were well phased to 2.3 or 2.0 A resolution. In these previous cases it was found that the X-ray sequence was 50 to 60% correct (Blundell
& Johnson, 1976), while in this study we expect the estimated sequence is no better

than 25 or 30% correct. We have found for hexokinase, a.s Watenpaugh et al. (1973) found earlier for rubredoxin, that crystallographic refinement can result in a great improvement in the estimated sequence. To begin the process of refinement and to have some assurance that it will converge on the true structure, it is necessary to have a reasonably accurate model of the backbone and a significant fraction of the side-chains. Given that start, we have initiated refinement of the sequence and atomic co-ordinates, which is described in the following paper (Anderson et al., 1978a).
