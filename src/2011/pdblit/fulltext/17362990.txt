COMMUNICATION

Implications of the Progressive Self-association of Wild-type Human Factor H for Complement Regulation and Disease
Ruodan Nan, Jayesh Gor and Stephen J. Perkins
Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Darwin Building, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, UK Received 2 October 2007; received in revised form 1 November 2007; accepted 6 November 2007 Available online 13 November 2007 Factor H (FH) is a major regulator of complement alternative pathway activation. It is composed of 20 short complement regulator (SCR) domains and is genetically associated as a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration. Previous studies on FH suggested that it existed in monomeric and dimeric forms. Improved X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation methodology for wild-type FH permitted a clarification of these oligomeric properties. Data at lower concentrations revealed a dependence of the X-ray radius of gyration values on concentration that corresponded to the weak self-association of FH. Global sedimentation equilibrium fits indicated that a monomer­dimer equilibrium best described the data up to 1.3 mg/ml with a fitted dissociation constant KD of 28 M and that higher oligomers formed at increased concentrations. The KD showed that about 85­95% of serum FH will be monomeric in the absence of other factors. Sizedistribution analyses in sedimentation velocity experiments showed that monomeric FH was the major species but that as many as six oligomeric forms co-existed with it. The data were explained in terms of two weak dimerisation sites recently identified in the SCR-6/8 and SCR-16/20 fragments of FH with similar KD values. These observations indicate a mechanism for the progressive self-association of FH and may be relevant for complement regulation and the formation of drusen deposits that are associated with age-related macular degeneration.

In the human innate immune defence system, the central complement component C3 is activated to C3b by the cleavage and removal of the small anaphylatoxin C3a to initiate the alternative pathway in serum. C3b is regulated by factor H (FH) in order to prevent complement-mediated host cell damage, in which FH acts as a co-factor for factor I cleavage of C3b to form iC3b,1­3 accelerating the decay of the C3 convertase C3bBb2,4 and competing with factor B for binding to C3b.5 FH is composed of

20 short complement regulator (SCR) domains, each of about 61 residues in length. SCR domains, also known as short consensus repeats, Sushi or complement control protein domains,6 constitute the most abundant domain type in complement proteins. There are multiple binding sites for C3b within the 20 SCR domains,7,8 and likewise there are multiple binding sites for heparin.9­12 FH regulates surfacebound C3b activity by recognising charge (anionic) clusters on the surfaces of host cells that are mimicked by heparin. The initial contact with host cells is made through its C-terminal end, which is followed by N-terminal regulatory activity. 13,14 Polymorphisms and mutations in FH have been associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD),15­19 the most common cause of blindness in the elderly in the Western world, and with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS),19,20 a rare

892 disease leading to renal failure that affects individuals of all ages but primarily children and young adults. The involvement of FH indicates that complement activation and regulation in the retina and the kidney endothelium have been impaired. Intact FH has not been crystallised to date for reasons of its size, glycosylation and inter-SCR flexibility. Thus, solution scattering and electron microscopy methods have been applied to show that the FH SCR domain structure is not fully extended in solution.21­23 X-ray scattering and ultracentrifugation, in combination with constrained scattering modelling, are powerful approaches24,25 that resulted in the first molecular structures for FH and its SCR-6/8, SCR-1/5 and SCR-16/20 fragments.23,26,27 Homology models for the SCR domains provided many of the first structural explanations for AMD and aHUS.23,28,29 Thus, AMD was associated with a common Tyr402His polymorphism, which is located at the surface of SCR-7 and close to a heparin binding site. The aHUSrelated mutations cluster at the surface of SCR-20 and to a lesser degree in SCR-16 to SCR-19, and they are associated with another heparin binding site. The distribution of more than 100 genetic alterations showed that the observed clinical phenotype is correlated with their structural location.19 NMR and crystal structures, starting with those for SCR-5 and SCR-15/16 and more recently extended to those for SCR-6/8 and SCR-19/20, have confirmed and extended these predictions.6,12,30­33 Even with these structures, there is no clear indication of a molecular mechanism involving FH that leads to AMD. One of the hallmarks of AMD is the appearance of drusen, an amyloid plaque-like deposition in Bruch's membrane, a layer interposed between the retinal pigment epithelium and the choroidal vasculature.34,35 The deposits contain oxidized lipids and many aggregated proteins, including FH.36 The self-association properties of FH are thus relevant to drusen formation. FH was originally shown to be monomeric by ultracentrifugation.37 Dimeric FH was demonstrated by scattering, but this observation could not be subsequently replicated. 21,23 Partial FH SCR-15/18 and SCR-15/20 dimers were however observed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, and SCR-1/7 was observed to interact with SCR-1/20 by surface plasmon resonance.8,13 Our recent ultracentrifugation and scattering studies showed that SCR6/8 and SCR-16/20 (but not SCR-1/5) exhibit weak monomer­dimer associations.26,27 These studies indicate at least two potential dimerisation sites in FH. In combination, the two sites would constitute a mechanism for the continual self-association of FH that would lead ultimately to aggregate formation. In this study, we re-investigated the oligomerisation properties of native FH. Through the use of improved scattering and ultracentrifugation instrumentation and analyses, we found and here show that FH exhibits a monomer­dimer equilibrium at physiological concentrations and multiple oligomers at higher concentrations.

cations of this result for complement regulation and AMD. X-ray scattering of FH oligomers The purification of wild-type FH for X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments utilised a 3-l pool of just-outdated anonymised human plasma from the Royal Free Hospital Blood Bank with an anti-FH monoclonal antibody Sepharose MRC-OX23 column as previously described.23,38 The final column eluate in 3 M MgCl2 was dialysed into Hepes buffer [10 mM Hepes, 137 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 7.4]. The FH concentration step at 4 °C employed a gentle centrifugation approach without stirring (Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices with a molecular-mass cutoff of 50 kDa at 2500g). Non-specific aggregates of FH and human serum albumin were removed by gel filtration on a SuperoseTM 6 prep grade XK 16/60 column, and the sample was re-concentrated by centrifugation. All FH samples were checked using SDS-PAGE before and after scattering and ultracentrifugation experiments. An absorption coefficient of 16.7 (1%, 280 nm, 1-cm path length) was used to determine concentrations.23 The X-ray scattering radius of gyration (RG) of FH monitors its degree of elongation. FH prepared 2 days beforehand was studied on Instrument ID02 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility39 in eight concentrations between 8.7 and 0.43 mg/ml in Hepes buffer (Fig. 1). Improved Guinier RG fits were obtained at lower Q values compared with the previous X-ray measurements at the Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury (Q = 4 sin /, 2 = scattering angle,  = wavelength).21,23 For reason of the higher beam intensities at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, improved signal­ noise ratios were obtained (Fig. 1a and b). There is better control of radiation damage on Instrument ID02 as this is monitored online during data acquisition. The Guinier RG and its cross-sectional radius of gyration (RXS-1) parameters (but not its RXS-2 parameter: not shown) and the associated intensity I (0)/c parameters showed small but visible concentration dependences (Fig. 1c­e). The RXS-2 parameter differs from SCR protein to protein and generally monitors the averaged short-range degree of bend between two or among three adjacent SCR domains along the length of the protein.23 An additional medium-range proximity relationship between nonneighbouring SCR domains that are further apart in the sequence leads to the observation of the RXS-1 region. 23 This weak concentration dependence showed that FH oligomerisation had occurred. Data obtained using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.15 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) were consistent with the Hepes data (Fig. 1c and e). The RG value extrapolated to zero concentration is 8.90 ± 0.19 nm, while RXS-1 is 2.51 ± 0.06 nm and RXS-2 is 1.79 ± 0.01 nm. If the slope in Fig. 1d corresponds to a

The Q fit range was 0.06­0.13 nm-1. The filled circles correspond to the I(Q) data used to determine the RG values, and the straight line corresponds to the best fit through those points. The Q·RG ranges used in the fits are arrowed. (b) The corresponding Guinier cross-sectional RXS-1 fits of ln I(Q)·Q versus Q2 for the same five scattering curves in a Q range of 0.16­0.26 nm-1 are shown. The RXS-2 fits in a Q range of 0.4­0.8 nm-1 are not shown. (c­e) Concentration dependence of the RG, I(0)/c and RXS-1 values (open circles). Each value was measured in quadruplicate and averaged. Statistical error bars are shown where visible. These data were fitted by linear regression. The open triangles correspond to the RG and I(0)/c parameters from (f). The filled triangles correspond to data measured in PBS. (f) Distance distribution function P(r) analyses. The four P(r) curves correspond to concentrations of 0.87 mg/ml (green), 2.61 mg/ml (red), 6.08 mg/ml (blue) and 8.69 mg/ml (cyan). The peaks in the P(r) curves are denoted as M1 at 4.9 nm and as M2 at 10.3 nm. The maximum length L was determined to be 32, 35 and 38 nm (numbered 1, 2 and 3, respectively). The intensities of the four P(r) curves are normalised using the peak M1 in order to show the concentration dependence of peak M2 and L more clearly. The dashed line corresponds to the P(r) curve obtained in 2001 for FH at 3.56 mg/ml in Tris­HCl buffer,23 for which L was determined to be 40 nm (numbered 4). X-ray scattering data were obtained in three beam time sessions on the Beamline ID02 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) operating with a ring energy of 6.0 GeV.38 Storage ring currents ranged from 63 to 65 mA and 66 to 91 mA (two sessions in 16-bunch mode) and from 170 to 172 mA (one beam session in uniform fill mode). Samples were measured in flow cells to reduce radiation damage by moving the sample continuously during beam exposure in 10 time frames of 0.1- or 0.2-s duration each for the uniform fill mode and those of 1.0- or 2.0-s duration each for the 16-bunch mode, together with online checks for the absence of radiation damage, after which the frames were averaged. Other details, including the data reduction procedure and the Guinier and P(r) analyses, are described elsewhere.26,27

894 monomer­dimer equilibrium, then the resulting dissociation constant KD is estimated to be 100 M. This is comparable with the KD values of 40 and 16 M observed for the SCR-6/8 and SCR-16/20 fragments, respectively.26,27 The present RG values for FH are lower than previous ones. This was shown by comparisons of Fig. 1 here with Fig. 3 of Ref. 23, reporting a 2001 analysis, and Fig. 2 of Ref. 21, reporting a 1991 analysis. In the 2001 analysis, the apparent RG value was 11.4 ± 0.4 nm, RXS-1 was 4.4 ± 0.2 nm and RXS-2 was 1.7 ± 0.1 nm. In the 1991 analysis, the apparent RG value was 12.4 ± 0.4 nm, RXS-1 was 3.6 ± 0.4 nm and RXS-2 was 1.8 ± 0.3 nm. These earlier values were confirmed by re-analyses of the earlier data files retrieved from archives. The difference is attributed to the presence of minor aggregation in 2001 and to a greater level of aggregation in 1991, together with worsened signal­noise ratios in 2001 and 1991 (data not shown). These issues may have masked the presently observed concentration dependence in FH. Previously, it was thought that alkaline pH values would cause FH to selfassociate.23 This was not confirmed after sample dialysis for 2 days at pH 11.9, followed by X-ray measurement. The indirect transformation of the scattering data I(Q) in reciprocal space in the Q range between 0.08 and 2.1 nm- 1 into real space gives the distance distribution function P(r). This summarises all the distances between pairs of atoms within FH. The P(r) function gives an independent calculation of the RG and I(0) values that is based on the full scattering curve and gives the maximum length of FH, denoted L. The RG and I(0)/c values from P(r) were in good agreement with the Guinier RG values (Fig. 1c and d). The eight P(r) curves show a concentration-independent peak M1 at r = 4.8 ± 0.3 nm. A second peak M2 was observed at r = 10.2 ± 0.6 nm, and peak M2 increased in its relative intensity as the concentration increased. L increased from 32 nm at 0.9 mg/ml to 38 nm at 8.7 mg/ml (Fig. 1f). These changes are attributed to oligomer formation in FH. As before,23 the value of L between 32 and 38 nm is about half the length of 73 nm expected if the 20 SCR domains in FH are in a fully extended arrangement. When compared with the P(r) curve from 2001 at 3.6 mg/ml in 25 mM Tris­HCl, 140 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM EDTA buffer, pH 7.4,23 peak M2 is now greater than M1 and L is 40 nm (Fig. 1f). This difference is consistent with the presence of minor aggregation in FH from 2001. The superimposition of the I(Q) curves from 1991 and 2001 upon the current ones shows increased intensities at low Q that are consistent with aggregation (not shown). Figure 1f shows that the SCR domains in FH are bent or folded back upon themselves in solution, both for the monomer and its oligomeric and aggregated forms.

hand were monitored using both absorbance and interference optics. Data were acquired at 4, 20 and 37 °C at 20 concentrations between 0.07 and 7.11 mg/ml and four rotor speeds between 8000 and 20,000 rpm. Absorbance data at 280 nm above 0.7 mg/ml were not fitted because of the saturation of the optics; thus, interference data were fitted. Data at 20 °C were fitted using SEDPHAT v4.10b software,40 initially using individual fits of 80 equilibrium curves and subsequently using global fits of between 9 and 20 curves. Similar fit outcomes were obtained with the data at 4 and 37 °C. In the individual fits, the fitting of a monomer­dimer model to the 11,000 rpm data at 1.32 mg/ml gave a reduced 2 value of 3.7 compared with that of 34.8 from a monomer model using the same data. In global fits up to 1.32 mg/ml and based on a fixed molecular mass of 145 kDa, the monomer­dimer model (reduced 2 of 11) gave significantly improved fits compared with a monomer model that gave a high molecular mass of 187 kDa and an increased reduced 2 of 22. Low random residuals were obtained (upper nine fits in Fig. 2). This showed that a monomer­dimer equilibrium existed in a physiological concentration range. At higher FH concentrations, the formation of higher oligomers was detected. Between 2.86 and 7.11 mg/ml, the monomer­dimer model did not result in good fits. Large deviations in the residuals were consistent with aggregate formation (lowest three fits in Fig. 2).41 Tests with other fit models based on the inclusion of trimers or tetramers gave no improvement in the residuals or reduced 2 values. The reduced 2 values of between 269 and 980 for these fits at higher concentrations showed that none of the monomer­dimer, monomer­dimer­ trimer and monomer­dimer­tetramer self-association models would fit. Hence, these data do not correspond to an equilibrium between monomers and higher oligomers. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE of the samples at three concentrations after ultracentrifugation showed that a dimer band was observed at the higher concentrations used, and fainter bands corresponding approximately to trimers and tetramers could be observed (Fig. 3b). There is no unpaired Cys residue in FH that would explain this. Size-exclusion gel filtration of the equilibrium samples 78 days after their original purification showed that the single homogenous peak originally obtained between 65 and 75 ml was supplemented by additional peaks that eluted between 50 and 65 ml (Fig. 2a). This showed that oligomers had formed during the ultracentrifugation experiment and the subsequent sample storage at 4 °C. Sedimentation velocity of higher FH oligomers The sedimentation coefficient s 0 20,w monitors macromolecular elongation and provides an independent monitor of the scattering data through its ability to detect sample polydispersity. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at six

monomeric FH.42,43 The fits were based on a resolution of 200 and a fixed frictional coefficient ratio f/fo of 1.78, while allowing both the meniscus and the cell bottom to float within a narrow range of 0.01 cm. At all concentrations, monomeric FH was observed to sediment at s020,w = 5.65 ± 0.05 S. This is in good agreement with previous determinations of the s020,w value of 5.5 to 5.6 S and 5.3 ± 0.1 S.2,23,36 A concentration dependence of the c(s) distributions was observed. At 0.17 mg/ml, the shape of the boundaries in Fig. 4b indicated a predominantly single sedimentation species. Between 0.05 and 0.63 mg/ml in either Hepes buffer or PBS, a second peak was observed in the c(s) analyses at 9.2 ± 0.5 S and its relative intensity increased with concentration (Fig. 4c). The c(M) size-distribution plots showed that the major peak at 5.65 S corresponds to a molecular mass of 142 ± 2 kDa. This is consistent with the global fit of the sedimentation equilibrium data (Fig. 2). At higher FH concentrations between 1.53 and 5.92 mg/ml and with the use of a 1-day-old FH preparation, the boundary fit of Fig. 4a indicated a more complex sedimentation profile. As the concentration increased, six smaller sedimentation species were consistently observed at s020,w values of 7.3 ± 0.2, 9.2 ± 0.2, 11.3 ± 0.4, 13.4 ± 0.06, 15.4 ± 0.2 and 17.2 ± 0.4 S at 50,000 rpm. This suggested that FH formed not only dimers but also trimeric to hep-

tameric oligomers in small but significant amounts of about 15% in total. This interpretation was verified starting from the four best-fit glycosylated FH models previously generated by constrained scattering modelling.23 The present RG value of 8.9 nm for monomeric FH (Fig. 1c) meant that these previous models which had an RG value of 9.9 nm were now too elongated. Thus, linkers in one of the previous four best-fit FH models were adjusted in order to generate a more compact SCR arrangement. In satisfactory agreement with the experimental s020,w value of 5.65 S, an s020,w value of 5.2 S was obtained from this glycosylated model using HYDROPRO v7c,44 with the default value of 0.31 nm for the atomic element radius for all atoms in order to represent the hydration shell. The s020,w calculations were insensitive to the presence or absence of six biantennary oligosaccharide chains at Asn511, Asn784, Asn804, Asn864, Asn893 and Asn1011 (mature protein numbering).23 If an FH monomer became spherical in its shape, the maximum possible s020,w value would be 9.4 S. Hence, postulating the occurrence of conformational changes in monomeric FH is unable to explain the discrete peaks seen at the larger s020,w values in Fig. 4c. Models to account for oligomer formation were arbitrarily created from dimerisation sites at opposite ends of the FH monomer model. Oligomers

Fig. 4. Sedimentation velocity of wild-type FH. Experiments at 20 °C were performed with FH in Hepes buffer in a concentration series from 0.07 to 5.92 mg/ml at speeds of 25,000, 40,000, 50,000 and 60,000 rpm to confirm reproducibility on two Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuges equipped with AnTi60 rotors. (a) The 200 scan boundaries for FH at 5.92 mg/ml at 50,000 rpm were fitted using Lamm equation fits with SEDFIT. Only every 10th scan is shown for reason of clarity. (b) The corresponding boundary fits are shown for FH at 0.17 mg/ml at 40,000 rpm. Other details follow (a). (c) In the five c(s) size-distribution analyses, the major sedimentation species at 5.65 S is labelled as 1. Its intensity was normalised in all five analyses for clarity. From bottom to top, the FH concentrations were 0.17, 0.63, 1.53, 2.99 and 5.92 mg/ml. The oligomeric FH peaks in increasing order of S values are labelled from 2 to 7. The five analyses are displaced by 10% of the intensity of peak 1, and in the top c(s) analysis, peak 2 is 7% of the intensity of peak 1. Underneath, six schematic models for oligomers of FH that yield the predicted s020,w values given in brackets are shown. The monomers are denoted by different colours and numbered. Monomers 2 and 3 are viewed in the same orientation in all the models except for the dimer.

were created using INSIGHT II 98.0 molecular graphics software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) on Silicon Graphics OCTANE workstations (Fig. 4). The predicted s020,w value for a dimer model in an extended conformation was 7.5 S, in good agreement with the observed peak at 7.3 S. The addition of a third monomer to this dimer model resulted in a predicted s020,w value of 9.2 S, in good agreement

with the observed peak at 9.2 S. Starting with the tetramer, it was found necessary to add further monomers in a more compact arrangement to give models with predicted s020,w values that agreed within error of the experimental values. The movement of monomer 1 in the tetrameric model towards the centre of the model gave a predicted value of 11.3 S, in good agreement with the observed peak at

898 11.3 S. The pentamer, hexamer and heptamer models gave predicted values of 13.5, 15.2 and 16.9 S, respectively, which agreed well with the experimental values of 13.4, 15.4 and 17.2 S, respectively. These agreements support the assignment of the six additional peaks at high S values in the c(s) plots to a series of FH oligomers. Conclusions Knowledge of the oligomeric state of FH is crucial for understanding its immunological function in complement regulation and its likely roles in AMD and aHUS. The new data collection in this study clarified that wild-type FH exhibits oligomeric forms after all, as originally proposed.21 A monomer­dimer equilibrium was identified at the lowest concentrations. Partial FH dimerisation has been reported by two other laboratories.8,13,32 As the concentration increases, higher oligomeric structures that can be as large as heptamers and are not in equilibrium with each other were identified. Our 2001 and 1991 studies on wild-type FH had reported RG values that were stated to be approximate for reason of the need to access the lowest Q values, which are difficult to measure with highly elongated proteins. Under these conditions, the aggregation of a highly elongated protein can be difficult to identify. Here, the use of freshly purified FH resulted in a lower RG value of 8.90 nm, in place of the apparent RG values of 11.4 and 12.4 nm from before. The sequence-calculated molecular mass of FH is 150,000 Da, assuming six N-linked oligosaccharides. In 2001, the molecular mass of FH was determined as 148,000­182,000 Da, as the result of which FH was deduced to be monomeric.23 In 1991, its molecular mass was determined to be 250,000­320,000 Da, leading to the deduction that FH was dimeric.21 The new data suggest that the 1991 result is best explained in terms of the presence of monomeric FH together with sufficient FH oligomers to double its averaged observed molecular mass. Oligomerisation in the 1991 study was favoured by the higher FH concentrations that were necessary for the X-ray data collection at that time. This study on FH oligomerisation resulted from the unexpected observation of weak monomer­ dimer equilibria for two fragments of FH. One equilibrium for the SCR-6/8 fragment of FH has a KD of about 40 M. Detailed ultracentrifugation equilibrium and velocity measurements were required to establish this as the compact structure of this SCR-6/8 dimer meant that dimerisation was not readily detected by X-ray scattering.26 However, the presence of the SCR-6/8 dimer was requisite for good X-ray modelling fits to its structure. The second weak monomer­dimer equilibrium with a KD of 16 M for the SCR-16/20 fragment was readily detected by both X-ray scattering and ultracentrifugation because this dimer has an extended structure.27 Both these KD values are comparable with the value of 28 M for wild-type FH from the SEDPHAT global fits below 1.36 mg/ml (Fig. 2). This suggests

Self-association of Factor H

that the dimerisation of both SCR-6/8 and SCR-16/ 20 is physiologically relevant, although both were recombinant proteins. As FH concentrations range between 0.235 and 0.810 mg/ml in blood,19 so long as no other factor requires consideration, this KD value of 28 M indicates that about 5­15% of FH in blood will be dimeric. The complement regulatory function of FH will be affected by dimer formation in serum. Thus, ligands may be sterically blocked from approaching their binding sites if they are proximate to either of the two presumed FH dimer sites or may not bind because of aggregate formation. Alternatively, ligand binding may be enhanced if binding sites are distant from the FH dimer sites, because FH would become multivalent in that case. Future studies on FH-ligand binding will be complicated by the observation of dimerisation. Thus, FH-ligand binding studies that disregard dimerisation are open to misinterpretation, as exemplified by a recent SEDPHAT sedimentation equilibrium study on SCR-6/8.12 Alternative approaches are required to establish 1:1 complex formation with ligands in the presence of dimers, such as that described in Fig. 3 of the original ultracentrifugation study on the SCR-6/8 complex with heparin, where titrations with a range of heparin­protein ratios were analysed using SEDFIT c(s) size-distribution plots.26 A mechanistic pathway for oligomer formation is suggested from this work. At higher concentrations, the existence of two weak self-association sites in FH suggests that FH can self-associate continuously by intermolecular contacts that occur alternately through both these sites to form large oligomers. These higher oligomers were indeed directly observed above 2 mg/ml in fresh FH samples by velocity experiments (Fig. 4). At low FH concentrations, the model in Fig. 4 suggests that extended dimer structures were formed, which would explain its reversibility. At higher concentrations, the formation of higher oligomers is predicted to involve more compact associations of the monomer (Fig. 4), and this would explain its lack of reversibility (Fig. 2). The storage of FH samples may facilitate the formation of more stable higher oligomers. Further studies on this are in progress. These results suggest that the use of freshly gel-filtrated FH samples stored below 1-mg/ml concentrations may be required for complement regulatory functional studies. The aggregation of FH is relevant for AMD, for which a risk factor is the observation of drusen deposits at the retinal surface. Currently, there is no detailed knowledge of the mechanism of drusen formation in AMD. It is possible that the localised accumulation of higher FH concentrations within the eye may facilitate the slow formation of protein precipitates within drusen during the course of a lifetime. For such a mechanism to operate, any FH precipitation in drusen would appear to necessitate concentrations of FH much higher than those seen physiologically in serum, and this would occur in the presence of a number of other components that are present. The latter would alter the kinetics and thermodynamics of deposit formation when

compared with a mechanism based only on FH selfassociation. In this context, it is intriguing that the His402 genetic polymorphism that is a risk factor for AMD showed a slightly higher propensity to selfassociate than the lower-risk Tyr402 form when the SCR-6/8 fragment was studied by X-ray scattering and ultracentrifugation.26
