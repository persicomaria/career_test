INTRODUCTION Rapid progress has been made in the field of protein design over the past couple of years. Computational design algorithms have been used to (i) stabilize naturally occurring proteins,1,2 (ii) increase the solubility of membrane proteins,3 and (iii) create de novo proteins that feature previously unknown structural folds.4 Hence, computational protein design opens a multitude of possibilities to study the complex processes of protein folding and to possibly create new structures with novel functional properties. The first completely de novo designed protein TOP7 (PDB 1QYS), for example, provided the opportunity to explore the energy landscape of a protein structure that was never exposed to natural selection pressure.5 The long-term goal of this research field is the ability to design proteins that perform the desired functions and exhibit high stability for possible application in industry and therapy. A major objective in the development of protein design is to create algorithms that are as simple as possible and need little processor time, yet are able to generate proteins that match a target structure with high accuracy. The recently published tetrapeptide fragment-based design algorithm6 is such a simple method, using statistical data of backbone conformations that are derived from tetrapeptide segments of full-length proteins. The algorithm was tested with the novel fold of the de novo protein TOP74 as target structure. Several nonhomolo-

gous amino acid sequences created with this new algorithm led to protein variants that exhibited cooperative folding and high thermodynamic stability.6 The most stable of these variants, named M7 [Fig. 1(A)], featured cooperative folding/unfolding transitions typical of naturally occurring proteins and circular dichroism spectra that indicated a well-ordered tertiary structure. It remained unclear, however, to what degree M7 matches the designed model, which is highly homologous to the TOP7 target structure (backbone RMSD 5 0.13 ° A). In the present study, the structure of M7 was solved with multidimensional NMR, revealing a well-ordered artificial protein that closely resembles the predicted fold ° (1.24 Æ 0.10 A average backbone RMSD). This result demonstrates the high precision of the structure predicAbbreviations: HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; HTQC, heteronuclear triple quantum correlation; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
NMR spectroscopy

The M7 protein was produced as previously described,6 except that 15N-enriched M7 was obtained by expression in M9 minimal medium. The NMR samples contained either nonlabeled or 15N-enriched M7 (1.0­1.3 mM) in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5, 0.05% sodium azide, 5% D2O). For hydrogen/deuterium exchange

measurements, the samples were dissolved in perdeuterated buffer. NMR data were collected at 258C with a DRX500 spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany), operating at 500.13 MHz proton resonance frequency and equipped with a 5-mm inverse triple-resonance (1H/13C/15N) probe that had XYZ-gradient capability. Homonuclear two-dimensional (2D) spectra (TOCSY and NOESY) as well as 15N-edited multidimensional spectra (2D HSQC, 2D HTQC, 3D TOCSY-HSQC, and 3D NOESY-HSQC) were acquired and processed as previously described.8 15N relaxation measurements were performed at 500.13 MHz as described elsewhere.9 R1 rates resulted from fitting of signal intensities from a series of

10 experiments with relaxation delays ranging from 100 to 1200 ms. R2 rates resulted from 11 experiments recorded with delays ranging from 8 to 192 ms. 15N{1H}heteronuclear NOE values were calculated as the ratio of signal intensities from experiments with and without proton saturation for 3 s. Model-free analysis10 was performed assuming isotropic rotational diffusion.

Structural Statistics of the Final 20 Energy-Minimized M7 Conformers

The sequence-specific 1H and 15N resonance assignments were derived via NOE connectivities according to the classical assignment strategy.11 NOE-derived distance restraints were determined from 2D and 3D NOESY spectra employing an internal distance calibration. Automated assignments of the NOEs, based on chemical shifts only, were obtained with the program nmr2st.12 The structures were computed, as described elsewhere,8 on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation with the program DYANA 1.513 using 1031 meaningful distance restraints that were obtained out of a total of 1477 NOE assignments. Subsequent restrained energy minimization was performed with the DISCOVER module of the INSIGHT 2000 software package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The 20 final selected M7 conformers were analyzed with PROCHECK-NMR.14 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The resonance assignment of M7 was completed, except for residues Gly-3 and Ser-2 that remained after cleavage of the His6-tag. The list of chemical shift values has been deposited at the BioMagResBank database under accession number BMRB-15478. Subsequent structure calculations were performed with the assigned residues His-1 to Val92. The final ensemble of 20 energy-minimized M7 conformers has been deposited at the RCSB database under PDB ID code 2JVF. It features an average backbone RMSD ° for the nonterminal residues Asp3-Arg91 of 1.09 Æ 0.14 A and only few violations of the experimental constraints (Table I). The overall structure of M7 [Fig. 1(B)] consists of a five-stranded antiparallel b-sheet, arranged in a 11, 22, 22, 11 topology, and two nearly parallel a-helices. The five b-strands comprise residues Asp3-Arg10 (A), Gln13-Arg20 (B), Asn45-Ser51 (C), Asp76-Asn82 (D), and Glu85-Arg91 (E), whereas the two a-helices encompass the segments Glu26-Ala41 (I) and Asp55-Leu72 (II). Excluding the more flexible turn regions, the average backbone RMSD of the secondary structure elements drops ° down to 0.91 Æ 0.15 A. Analysis of the backbone dihedral angles f and w furthermore showed that less than 1% of all non-glycine/non-proline residues in M7 fall within the disallowed regions of conformational space (Table I). Interestingly, the N-terminal half of the M7 structure (i.e., residues Asp3-Gly42 comprising b-strands A and B as

well as a-helix I) displays a significantly lower structural ° precision (average backbone RMSD 5 1.26 Æ 0.21 A), compared to the C-terminal half (i.e., residues Arg44-Arg91 comprising b-strands C, D, and E as well as a-helix II) with ° an average backbone RMSD of 0.70 Æ 0.12 A [Fig. 1(C)]. Moreover, H/D exchange data also demonstrated that the majority of M7 residues showing slowed amide proton exchange resides in the C-terminal half of the protein (Ile48, Thr49, Ile50, Asp76, and Val90 in the b-sheet; Leu61, Leu62, Leu64, Ile65, Ala66, Leu68, Leu69, and Leu72 in a-helix II; Ile77 in the turn aII-bD, possibly H-bonded to the backbone oxygen of Lys75), whereas in the N-terminal half no slowed exchange was observed at all in a-helix I and only for two residues in the b-sheet (Ile4 and Ile19). Hence it appears that the C-terminal half of M7 is more rigid, as evidenced by a stronger hydrogen bond network. A similar correlation was also reported for TOP7.4,15 The increased conformational divergence observed in the N-terminal half of M7 [Fig. 1(C)] is most pronounced in the loop preceding a-helix I, where it could be a result of the limited number of structurally relevant NOEs found for residues Ser22, Thr23, and Gly24. On the other hand, this lack of NOE connectivities is in part due to considerable line-broadening observed for the backbone amide signals of Ser22 and especially Gly24. Such line-broadening effects, which are indicative of differences in backbone dynamics, were furthermore found for residues Asp11 and Gly12 (b-turn between b-strands A and B) as well as Ala41 and Gly42 (end of a-helix I), that is, residues that all reside in the N-terminal half of the protein structure. Preliminary analysis of 15N relaxation data [see supplementary material] indicates that these particular loops/ turns all feature reduced generalized order parameters S2, in addition to the N-terminus (Met0 and Lys1) and the turn region bD-bE (Thr84 and Val86). The origin of this increased backbone mobility mostly within the N-terminal

half of the M7-fold still needs to be determined. Possibly, the lack of stabilizing residues at the N-terminal cap16 of a-helix I could play a role. The comparison of the NMR ensemble with the previously designed structural model of M76 revealed a very good agreement in the overall fold [Fig. 1(C)]. The average backbone RMSD between the model and the 20 con° formers amounts to 1.24 Æ 0.10 A for the segment Asp3Arg91, which is almost within the structural precision of the NMR ensemble itself. Minor differences in the secondary structure elements were observed only in b-strand A, b-strand D, and a-helix I (all one residue longer at the Nterminal end in the model) as well as b-strand B (one residue longer at the C-terminal end in the model). Moreover, a stabilizing salt-bridge, which had been predicted by the model between Glu35 (a-helix I) and Lys71 (a-helix II), was found in all but one of the 20 NMR conformers. In summary, it can be stated that the amino acid sequence, which was created by the tetrapeptide fragmentbased design algorithm, produced an overall fold that matches the target structure very closely. Future studies with alternative structural targets will have to show (i) how well this tetrapeptide fragment-based design approach performs in other cases, and (ii) whether functionally active proteins can be created by this method. The present study, however, clearly demonstrates that the structural information encoded in the tetrapeptide fragments used in this relatively simple approach is sufficient to yield a high precision in structure design.
