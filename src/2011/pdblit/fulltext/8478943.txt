In an early binding study 1, using an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-fl-D-Gal antibody reagent, both methyl 4-deoxy- and 4-chloro-4-deoxy-fl-o-galactopyranoside were found to be much inferior inhibitors of the binding of a fl-o-galactopyranoside artificial antigen [0.2-0.3% of the potency exhibited by fl-D-Gal-OMe (1)] than was methyl 4-amino-4-deoxy-fl-D-galactopyranoside (2 14% of the potency of 1). In view of our more recent studies of the binding of oligosaccharides by monoclonal antibodies and !,ctins 2, it can be expected that OH-4 together with OH-3 provided the key polar grouping for the binding reaction of 1. Furthermore, it seems likely that the interaction was with the carboxylate group of an aspartate unit, as was found to be the case for the key OH-3 and OH-4 groups of the fl-o-Gal unit of the Lewis b human blood group determinant when bound by the lectin IV of Griffonia simplicifolia (GSIV) 3-5. The key polar interaction for this binding reaction is displayed in Fig. 1 for the methyl glycoside (Leb-OMe) of the Lewis b blood group related tetrasaccharide. In view of the appreciable activity exhibited by the aminogalactoside 2, it was apparent that substantial activity may be maintained upon substitution of a key hydroxyl group by an amino group. This possibility found support in the observation by Rahuel et al. 6 that N-deacetylation of the C~-D-GalNAc unit of the A human blood group determinant led to an acquired B-activity, The B human blood group determinant has a hydroxyl group in the place of the acetamido group of the A epitope. Later, it was found that this OH-2 of the 7-D-Gal unit of the B trisaccharide was strongly involved in the key polar grouping for binding by two different monoclonal anti-B antibodies 7. Therefore, it became of interest to establish the effect of replacing OH-3b and OH-4b of the Leb-OMe by an amino group on the binding by GSIV, especially since the crystal

The isopropylidene group was removed by hydrolysis in 90% trifluoroacetic acid and the product*, 3-azido-6-O-benzoyl-3-deoxy-D-glucopyranose, was isopropylidenated in the usual manner and, as expected from the work of Meyer zu Reckendorf and Spohr 9, provided 3-azido-6-O-benzoyl-3-deoxy-1,2-O-isopropylidene-e-D-glucopyranose, m.p. 129-130 °, [c~]o + 132 ° (CHCI3). The presence of the azido group was displayed by i.r. absorption at 2050 cm -l. The free hydroxyl group was mesylated for replacement by benzoate with inversion of C-4. Removal of the isopropylidene group and acetylation followed by treatment with HBr in AcOH then provided the reagent (3) desired for glycosylation of methyl 2-acetamido-4,6-O-benzylidene-2-deoxy-fl-D-glucopyranoside using Hg(CN)2 as promoter to form the substituted disaccharide 4, m.p. > 245 ° (dec.), [~]D -- 19° (CHC13)The benzylidene group of 4 was removed by hydrolysis in 70% aq.

Reduction of 9 with sodium cyanoborohydride in the presence ofHCP '12provided allyl 2,0-acetyl-3,6-di-O-benzyl-fl-D-glucopyranoside (10), m.p. 60.5-61.5 °, [c~]D - 2 8 ° (CHCI3). The hydroxyl group of 10 was replaced by azide with inversion of C-4 in near 50% yield by way of either the 4-O-mesylate or 4-O-triflate derivative. The allyl aglycon of the 4-azido-D-galacto compound (11), m.p. 47.5-48.5 °, [C~]D--16.5 (CHCI3), was replaced by hydrogen by rearrangement to the 1-O-propenyl glycoside using tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium (I) chloride in the presence of 1,4-diazabicyclooctane followed by hydrolysis using HgClz-Hg@ 3'14. The product was treated with oxalyl bromide in CHzC12 and N,N-dimethylformamide to produce the glycosyl bromide 12; which was used for the preparation of 13 in 71% yield, m.p. 258-259 ° (dec.), [c~] + 0.2 ° D (CHCI3) , under the conditions described for the preparation of 4.

As already described for the preparation of 5, compound 13 was deacetylated and hydrolyzed to provide the triol 14, which was preferentially benzyloxymethylated to form 15. Tri-O-benzyl-e-L-fucopyranosylation under bromide-ion catalyzed conditions then gave 16, which was reduced in the presence of HC1 to provide the desired amine 17a. The hydroxyl group at the T-position proved highly resistant to fucosylation and the yield of 16 was only 34%. A comparison of the 1H-n.m.r. parameters for the free bases 8b and 17b with those previously reported 4 for Leb-OMe confirmed the structural assignments. The chemical shifts for the hydrogens of the fl-l>GlcNAc-OMe unit were the same within 0.02 p.p.m., except for the acctyl group of 8b, which was shielded by 0.05 p.p.m. The situation was

similar for the ring hydrogens of the two fucose units, except that the chemical shift for H-lc oflTb was deshielded by 0.08 p.p.m, from the shift observed for H-lc of Leb-OMe. In the case of the H-1 d hydrogens, that of 8b was shielded by 0.13 p.p.m. As expected, the major changes were in the chemical shifts for the ring hydrogens of the fl-o-Gal b-unit. In the case of 8b, H-3b was shielded by 0.64 p.p.m, whereas for 17b H-4b was shielded by 0.74 p.p.m. For the 3-amino compound 8b, H-2b was shielded by 0.07 p.p.m, and H-4b shielded by 0.09 p.p.m. In the case of the 4-amino compound 17b, H-2b was shielded by 0.20 p.p.m, and H-3b deshielded by 0.10 p.p.m. The signals for the other hydrogens were not assigned. It could be imagined that substitution of OH-3b of Leb-OMe by an amino group to form8 would lead to the hydrogen-bond network (18) on binding by the GSIV lectin, especially at pH 8 where the amino group should exist extensively as the free base. However, the compound was found to be completely inactive in the pH range 5-8 using a solid-phase competitive radioimmunoassay3. Indeed, a 1500#M solution provided slightly negative potencies, indicating a slight increase in nonspecific binding of the radioactive artificial antigen to the immobilized lectin. Therefore, the confines of the combining site cannot entertain an amino group to form the type of complex illustrated by 18. Substitution of OH-4b of Leb-OMe by an amino group to form 17 also provided a

highly inactive compound. Consequently, probably because of the need for hydration, the combining site also cannot adopt the type of complex represented by 19. The key hydroxyl groups for the binding of Leb-OMe by a monoclonal antibody were found to be OH-3b of thefl-D-Gal unit and OH-2d of the ~-L-Fuc (1 ~ 2 b ) unit 15. In view of the above-mentioned results with the lectin GSIV, it could be expected that 8 would be inactive as an inhibitor. This was the case at p H 5, since a 3000/~ concentration produced no detectable inhibition. The inhibition rose with increasing pH and, by extrapolation, it was estimated that the 6000/z~a concentration would provide near 50% inhibition at p H 8. On this basis, 8 is almost 300 times less potent than Leb-OMe at p H 8 and even less potent with protonation of the amino group at lower p H values. The replacement of OH-4b by hydrogen led to a weak inhibitor of the binding of the Le b artificial antigen by the monoclonal anti-Le b antibody ~5'16.It was concluded that the involvement of the hydroxyl group in the binding reaction was marginal in character and to become involved as proton acceptor for intramolecular hydrogen bonding with OH-6b when the Leb-OMe tetrasaccharide was bound by the antibody. On the basis of these observations, it was to be expected that replacement of OH-4b by an amino group to provide 17 would result in a weaker inhibitor, but especially so in acid media where the hydrogen bonding of the a m m o n i u m group with water would be strong and participation of OH-4b as a proton acceptor for hydrogen bonding with OH-6b would be effectively eliminated. In fact, in agreement with expectation, the potency of 17 relative to that for Leb-OMe was only 8% at p H 5 but rose to 48% at p H 8. It is to be noted in this regard that interactions with combining sites which appear to require intramolecular hydrogen bonding 2 [judging from the crystal structure at 2.8 A resolution for the (Leb-OMe)2 GSIV complex 5] may actually be the result of changes in the hydration of the complex about the periphery of the combining site, since these hydroxyl groups appear to be in only marginal contact with nonpolar groups of the protein.
