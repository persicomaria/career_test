Introduction
The methodology of in vitro selection and amplification of nucleic acids (also called SELEX) [l-3] has made it possible to select from random single-stranded RNA and DNA libraries unique nucleic acid folds that can target ligands of interest. (These ligands range from small cofactors to proteins and are bound with affinities in the micromolar to nanomolar range (reviewed in [4-7]).) These RNA and DNA aptamer complexes offer a unique opportunity of gaining new insights into nucleic acid architecture and recognition (reviewed in [S]) and the structural elements that contribute to catalytic activity of nucleic acids [6,7]. RNA aptamer methodology has led to the selection of novel ribozymes exhibiting kinase [9], ligase [lo], amide bond cleavage [ll] and amino-acid transfer [12] activities, and RNA-cleaving [13] and DNA-cleaving [14] divalent cation-dependent DNA enzymes have been identified on

the basis of DNA aptamer methodology. Here we address the similarities and/or differences in the architectures, binding pockets and recognition elements of RNA [15] and DNA [16] aptamers with different binding-site sequences that target the same ligand (ATP in our case). Such an analysis is now possible after our determination of the solution structure of the AMP-DNA aptamer complex and comparison with the solution structure [17] and dynamics [18] of the AMP-RNA aptamer complex reported previously from our laboratory (see also [19]). The fundamental insights into molecular recognition that can be gained should have an impact on processes ranging from the design of ribozymes and DNAzymes to their potential therapeutic applications [20,21]. Huizenga and Szostak [16] have applied in vitro selection techniques to identify a DNA aptamer that binds ATP

This DNA aptamer, which also binds AMP and adenosine with similar affinity, contains two highly conserved guanine-rich regions, two invariant adenine residues and two regions of predominant Watson-Crick covariation (Figure la). Our nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-molecular dynamics structure determination of the AMP-DNA aptamer complex reported below identifies the formation of a tertiary fold of the DNA aptamer containing pairs of related G.G and G*A mismatches and G-AMP recognition sites, shown schematically in Figure lb. This architecture is different from the Huizenga-Szostak model [ 161 of the complex based on site-directed mutagenesis and base analog substitution experiments, which proposed that the ATP-binding pocket was centered about two bulges containing adenine residues, which flank a G-tetrad and helical stems that emanate from this G-quadruplex platform (see Figure Sl in the Supplementary material provided with the internet version of this paper).

The imino proton spectra (8.5 to 14.5 ppm) of the self-complementary 14-mer AMP-binding DNA aptamer 2 in the free state and bound to two equivalents of AMP in Ha0 buffer are plotted in Figure 2b and e, respectively. The imino proton spectra sharpen dramatically on complex formation with the twofold symmetry of the free duplex retained in the complex (Figure Ze). Separate resonances are observed for the free 1Cmer DNA aptamer 2 and the complex containing two bound AMP molecules at substoichiometric additions of AMP, with no

The corresponding imino proton spectrum of the 27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex (containing excess AMP corresponding to the addition of three equivalents of ligand) in H,O buffer is plotted in Figure 3a. The imino proton resonances remain narrow and well dispersed in this complex, which contains two nonequivalent AMP-binding sites henceforth designated I and II. The NMR spectra of this 27mer DNA aptamer 1 complex are of a quality necessary for structural characterization. The corresponding imino proton spectrum of the 27-mer DNA aptamer 1 analog containing a G8 for I8 substitution in Ha0 buffer is plotted in Figure 3b. The spectral patterns are consistent with complex formation for this analog with the imino proton of G8 at 12.65 ppm (Figure 3a) shifting downfield to 14.39 on inosine substitution (Figure 3b). The data analysis leading to proton assignments and resolution of overlapping cross peaks was greatly aided by collecting NMR data on AMP complexes of DNA aptamer 1 analogs containing nine inosine, two adenine and one 06-methyl guanine for guanine substitutions, three N6methyl adenine for adenine substitutions and one deletion in the sequence as shown schematically in Figure 3c. Single base substitutions that resulted in complex formation are represented by [++I, those that resulted in weak binding are represented by [+/-I and those that resulted in no binding by [-] in the schematic in Figure 3c.

The exchangeable and nonexchangeable protons in the 27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex have been assigned from analysis of two-dimensional NMR data sets on complexes containing both unlabeled and uniformly labeled i3C,15NAMP. The excellent quality of the two-dimensional NMR data sets can be observed in expanded NOESY (140 ms mixing time) contour plots of the corresponding unlabeled AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex in Ha0 buffer (Figure 4). These include cross-strand nuclear Overhauser effects (NOES) between the imino protons (10.0 to 14.2 ppm) and base and amino protons (5.0 to 9.0 ppm) across Watson-Crick pairs (Figure 4a) and between hydrogen-bonded guanine amino protons (8.2 to 9.2 ppm) and nonexchangeable base protons (6.0 to 8.4 ppm) of nearby purine residues across mismatch pairs (Figure 4b) within the DNA aptamer in the complex.

The analysis of intramolecular and intermolecular NOE patterns identified a range of mismatch alignments on AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex formation. The alignment of the sheared G18aAlO (also GSmA23)mismatch pair is defined by strong NOES between the amino protons of G18 and the H8 proton of A10 and G9, strong NOES between the amino protons of A10 and the sugar Hl' proton of G18 and an upheld chemical shift of = 10.5 ppm for the exposed imino proton of G18 in the complex. The alignment of the reversed Hoogsteen GSaG19 (also GZlaG6) mismatch pair is defined by a strong NOE between the imino proton of G8 and the H8 proton of G19, a downfield chemical shift of = 12.3 ppm for the hydrogenbonded imino proton of G8 and a broadened-out resonance for the exposed imino proton of G19 in the complex. The AMP,.G9 (also AMP,,.GZZ) recognition alignment is defined by a strong NOE between the hydrogen-bonded amino proton of G9 and the HZ proton of AMP,, a strong NOE between the hydrogen-bonded amino proton of AMP, and the Hl' proton of G9 and an upfield chemical shift of = 10.3 ppm for the exposed imino proton of G9 in the complex.

The solution structure of the complex was solved starting from distance geometry followed by distance-restrained molecular dynamics calculations guided by a restraints list which included 44 intermolecular NOES (Table l), with the computational protocols outlined in the Materials and methods section. We incorporated 15 experimentally identified hydrogen-bonding distance restraints for the stem Watson-Crick and wobble TlZeG16 pairs (Figure la) in the complex during the distance geometry phase of the computations. An additional 12 experimentally identified hydrogen-bonding distance restraints for the six mismatches in the central core of the complex (Figure lb) were incorporated at the start of the distance-restrained molecular dynamics computations in one set of calculations (protocol 1) but excluded in a second set of calculations (protocol 2). It should be noted that similar refined structures of the complex resulted from using protocols 1 and 2, implying that the distribution of intramolecular and intermolecular NOES in the core of the complex defines the mismatch pairing alignments.

(excluding poorly defined phosphates of bound AMPS) based on computational protocol 1 are plotted in stereo in Figure 6a and exhibit root-mean-squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) values of 1.40 f 0.27 for the entire complex and 1.17kO.18 for the core (G5-GlO, G18-G23 and bound AMPS) of the complex (Table Za). Individual residues in the Watson-Crick and mismatch-paired stem segment are well defined amongst the refined structures of the complex (shown schematically in Table Zb). A representative distance-refined structure of the central segment of the 27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex containing two bound AMP molecules is shown in stereo in Figure 6b. The refined structures of the complex are quite similar using computational protocol 2 (see Figure SZ in the Supplementary material) with corresponding r.m.s.d. values in the range 1.48 f 0.33 for the entire complex and 1.21 * 0.18 for the core of the complex (Table Za). The two AMP-binding sites, which are located in the minor groove of the DNA helix, span a continuous sixbase mismatch segment with all mismatches containing guanine and adenine residues adopting anti glycosidic torsion angle alignments in the complex (Figure 6b).

A ribbon is drawn through the backbone. The color code is the same as in (a).

two nonequivalent AMP-binding sites in the 27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex (Figure lb) exhibit features in common with the AMPrmG9 recognition mismatch flanked by sheared AlOeG18 and reversed G8sG19 mismatches at site I (pairing alignments shown in Figure 7b) and the AMP,,*GZZ recognition mismatch flanked by sheared AZ3aG5 and reversed G'2laG6 mismatches at site II (Figure 6b). The helix is unwound within individual (G5-G6).(GZlGZ-A23) and (GlS-G19).(G8-G9-AlO) AMP-binding sites and is also bent slightly towards the major groove centered about the adjacently bound AMP molecules in the complex. The sugar Hl' protons on the two bound AMP molecules are directed towards and approach within 3.6 A of each other, as do the sugar H4' protons (within 3.0 A of each other) among the refined structures of the complex. There is extensive cross-strand stacking between bases on adjacent mismatch pairs as observed between G9 and G18 and between AMP, and A10 for binding site I (Figure 7a) and as observed for the corresponding cross-strand stacking between residues associated with the binding site II counterpart in the complex.

In addition, adjacent G19 and A20 purine residues are approximately coplanar, as are adjacent G6 and G7 residues (Figure 7c), resulting in the formation of adjacent mutually stacked (G8*G19).AZO and (GZl*G6).G7 threebase platforms (Figure 8a). There is both cross-strand (between G6 and G19) and same-strand stacking between these platforms (Figure 8b), with a significant displacement in the helix axis associated with the two halves of the complex at this central step (Figure 6). The generation of this unique adjacent three-base platform architecture is associated with an expanded rectangular minor groove binding pocket (in which segments of the phosphodiester backbone are aligned normal to the helix axis) capable of accommodating the two adjacently bound AMP molecules, as shown in space-filling views of the complex in the right panels of Figure 9a and b.

absence of syn glycosidic torsion angles rules out formation of a G-quadruplex with antiparallel alignments of adjacent strands as proposed in the Huizenga-Szostak model [ 161 for the solution structure of the ATP-binding DNA aptamer complex, because this would require alternating G(sy~)G(anti) alignments along individual strands and alternating G(syn).G(ant;).G(syn).G(anti) alignments around individual G-tetrads [23-261. Further, A10 and A23 are not bulged residues as proposed in the Huizenga-Szostak model [16], but rather participate in sheared G-A mismatch formation as established in the present study of the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex.
The DNA aptamer AMP molecules complex contains two adjacently bound

All studies of ligand-RNA aptamer and ligand-DNA aptamer complexes reported previously have either assumed or demonstrated one ligand bound per nucleic acid aptamer (reviewed in [5,6]). This stoichiometry has been confirmed from available structural studies on ligand-RNA aptamer and ligand-DNA aptamer complexes in solution (reviewed in [S]). Our identification of two AMP molecules bound to the DNA aptamer represents an unexpected and striking result that opens up new avenues to molecular recognition by nucleic acid binding sites. The pair of AMP ligands must cooperatively target their binding sites on the DNA aptamer as our NMR experimental data found no evidence for complexes containing one bound AMP per DNA aptamer during the gradual addition of the cofactor to the nucleic acid (Figure 2).

The two bound AMP molecules are positioned in close spatial proximity to each other within a rectangular binding pocket in our NMR-based solution structure of the AMP-DNA aptamer 1 complex (Figures 6,9,10). We have been unable to directly define potential contacts between the bound AMPS in the complex, however. This is because the individual base and sugar protons of bound AMP, and AMP,, have only slightly different chemical shifts precluding the unambiguous identification of potential NOES between the same proton type for the AMP molecules bound at sites I and II in the complex. Further, the phosphates of the bound AMPS are poorly defined among the refined structures of the complex, precluding the identification of potential sugar-phosphate interactions between bound AMP molecules in the complex. We address here the issue of the unexpected stoichiometry of two AMPS bound per DNA aptamer at the millimolar DNA concentrations used in our NMR studies. The selection experiments of Huizenga and Szostak [16] were undertaken on 1-3 mM ATP covalently attached through its Cs position using a nine-atom linker to an agarose column. It is conceivable, given the long length of the linker, that adenine rings of adjacent covalently bound ATP molecules were brought into proximity on the agarose column through stacking interactions of their purine rings. Such alignments could conceivably facilitate the selection of DNA aptamer sequences that target a pair of immobilized ATP molecules on the agarose column. The bound DNA aptamers were subsequently eluted from the agarose column with ATP-containing buffer [16].

Our results establish that the unstructured asymmetric internal bubble of the free AMP-binding DNA aptamer zippers up through base mismatch and three-base platform alignment on complex formation. Such adaptive binding is a recurring feature in previous reports of other RNA and DNA aptamer complexes (reviewed in [S]). The present study of the binding of a pair of AMPS to an asymmetric internal bubble-containing DNA aptamer through mismatch and three-base platform zippering up of the helix has striking parallels with our previous demonstration of the binding of a single molecule of the cofactor flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to an asymmetric internal bubble-containing RNA aptamer through mismatch and base-triple zippering up of the helix [27]. The AMP molecules pair with guanines and are intercalated into the zippered-up mismatch-containing helix of the DNA aptamer complex reported here, while the isoalloxazine ring of the bound FMN pairs with an adenine and is intercalated into the zippered-up mismatch-containing helix of the RNA aptamer complex described in [27].

Quality

of the refined

structures

We determined the same family of solution structures of the AMP-DNA aptamer 1 complex (as defined by r.m.s.d. values for both the entire and core complexes, Table Z), independently of whether experimentally identified noncanonical base pairs were included (protocol 1) or excluded (protocol 2) during the distance-restrained molecular dynamics calculations. The number of > 0.2 A violations were 11.1 * 1.4 (protocol 1) and 12.6 + 2.2 (protocol 2) for the central core (G5-A10 and GlB--A23 plus two bound AMPS) of the complex (Table 2). The majority of these violations are centered about the G7 and A20 residues, which participate in base platform formation (Figure 8) and correspond to the least well-defined segment of the complex on the basis of the available distribution of restraints to guide the computations.
Adaptive binding

Six consecutive base mismatches, two of which also participate in three-base platforms, constitute the binding pocket of the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex (Figure 6b). The outermost mismatches (G5sA23 and GlBaAlO) are of the sheared G*A type, which involve pairing of the minor groove of the guanine and the major groove of the adenine (Figure 7b, top). Such sheared G-A base pairs were initially postulated from computational approaches [ZB] and subsequently identified experimentally in DNA [29] and RNA [30]. Such sheared G-A mismatches tend to be involved in extensive cross-strand stacking with flanking pairs and hence it is not surprising that extensive cross-strand stacking of G9 and G18 and of A10 and AMP, has been observed between the adjacent sheared GlBeAlO and recognition G9*AMP, mismatches for binding site I in the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex (Figure 7a). Indeed, the stacking is manifested in the large upfield shifts observed for the base and sugar protons of A10 (HB: 7.42 ppm, Hl': 4.85 ppm, HZ': 1.06 ppm, H4': 3.16 ppm) and A23 (HB: 7.29 ppm, Hl': 4.78 ppm, HZ': 1.08 ppm, H4': 3.02 ppm) on complex formation, because of their position directly over the purine rings of the bound AMPS (Figure 7a). The innermost mismatches (G6eGZl and G19mG8) are of the reversed Hoogsteen GaG type involving pairing of the Watson-Crick edge of one guanine (GB and G21) and the Hoogsteen edge of its partner guanine (G19 and G6) (Figure 7b, bottom). Such reversed Hoogsteen G.G mismatches have been previously postulated [31] and identified [32] within the Rev binding site on Rev response

An important consideration relates to the incorporation of reversed mismatches whose glycosidic bonds are oriented in opposite directions (associated with parallelstranded duplexes) adjacent to regular mismatches whose

glycosidic bonds are oriented in the same direction (associated with antiparallel-stranded duplexes) in a DNA helix. This can be achieved by the looping out of intervening bases, as has been reported in the Rev peptide-RRE RNA complex [32,34] or through looping out of adjacent bases (G7 and A20) to generate three-base

DNA

The recognition mismatches (G9*A, and GZZ.A,,) involve a novel alignment that pairs the minor groove of guanine with the Watson-Crick edge of adenine (Figure 7b, center). This G-A mismatch alignment differs from the sheared G-A mismatch pair [29,30] in that the minor groove of the guanine pairs with the Watson-Crick edge of the adenine in the former alignment (Figure 7b, center) whereas it pairs with the Hoogsteen edge of the adenine in the latter alignment (Figure 7b, top). The same recognition G-AMP alignment has been observed in the corresponding AMP-RNA aptamer complex [ 17,191.
Binding-pocket architecture

minor groove at the binding site for bound AMPS essentially doubles in the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex (Figure 9b, right) relative to the separation in B-form DNA (Figure 9b, left). The two intercalated AMP ligands are separated by a pair of stacked three-base platforms in our solution structure of the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex (Figure 6b). A somewhat parallel result has been reported for the binding of two actinomycin D molecules at adjacent overlapping G-C binding sites in the d(G-C-G-C).d(G-C-G-C) sequence context where the intercalated phenoxazone chromophores are separated by two base pairs [37,38]. For both complexes, there is unwinding of the helix associated with complex formation and a bending of the helix towards the major groove, resulting in an opening of the minor groove to relieve potential steric clashes and accommodate the adjacently bound ligand molecules. The concept of base platforms, where adjacent bases are positioned in the same plane rather than stacked on top of each other, emerged initially from computational models of triad DNA 1391. Such models proposed that triplet repeat disease sequences could adopt triad DNA structures where antiparallel duplexes were constructed of base triads rather than base pairs. The X-ray structure of the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme provided the first experimental demonstration of base platforms at three A-A steps [40] and this was followed by NMR identification of a triad containing an A-A platform

The concept of dimeric ligands targeting the minor groove of DNA has been previously reported for complexes of distamycin dimers bound to dA.dT-rich sites [35] and divalent cation-coordinated chromomycin dimers bound to dG.dC-rich sites [36] on duplex DNA. The widening of the minor groove in these complexes is achieved without distorting the sugar-phosphate backbone at the binding site, which remains inclined by = 45" relative to the helix axis. By contrast, segments of the sugar-phosphate backbone are normal to the helix axis in the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex, generating an unprecedented rectangular widened minor groove (Figure 9a, right), in stark contrast to its counterpart in B-form DNA (Figure 9a, left).

in the RNA-binding site for the S8 protein [41] and a triad containing a T-A platform in the DNA quadruplex formed by the single-repeat Born&x mori telomeric sequence [42]. Our study presents additional examples of base platforms at G6-G7 and G19-AZ0 steps (Figure 7c) in the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex. It should be noted that there is an important distinction between base triads, where the three bases are positioned in a triangular alignment [39,41,42], and the three-base (G%G19).A20 and (G21.G6).G7 platforms in the AMP-27mer DNA aptamer 1 complex, where the three bases are positioned in a linear alignment (Figure 8a,b). The adjacent three-base (G%G19)*A20 and (G21.G6).G7 platforms contribute two critical structural components to the architecture of the binding pocket. First, the linear array of the three bases in the individual platforms results in a dramatic widening of the minor groove and, together with the sheared G.A mismatch alignments, contributes to the rectangular shape of the expanded minor groove binding pocket (Figure 9a, right panel). Second, they contribute to the = 4 A displacement in the helix axis, which is centered between the adjacently stacked (G8*G19).A20 and (G21.G6).G7 platforms in the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex (Figure 6).

Uniqueness

of the AMP-DNA

aptamer

fold

We have reported here the structure of a new secondary and tertiary fold for the AMP-DNA aptamer complex containing two cofactor molecules bound per DNA aptamer 1. On the basis of the published selection strategy [16], it is conceivable that AMP could also target other DNA folds with comparable micromolar affinity. Huizenga and Szostak [16] identified the ATP-binding DNA aptamer 1 investigated in this paper by using a two-step selection protocol. They identified 17 clones after eight rounds of selection, all of which had different sequences and appeared to be of independent origin. One of these clones was chosen for a second round of selection, from which emerged DNA aptamer 1. It is conceivable that the choice of other clones for secondround selection could have resulted in the identification of AMP-binding DNA aptamers with different stoichiometries and/or tertiary folds.
Distinct tertiary structure architectures and AMP-DNA aptamer complexes for the AMP-RNA

The ATP-binding RNA [15] and DNA [16] aptamers have very different binding-site sequences and secondary structure folds. In addition, we have established here that the ATP-binding RNA and DNA aptamers also exhibit

different ligand-binding stoichiometries. It would therefore be reasonable to anticipate that the ATP-binding RNA and DNA aptamer complexes will exhibit distinct tertiary structure architectures; this has now been verified through the determination of the structures of the complexes in solution (Figure IO). The ATP-binding RNA aptamer binds one equivalent of AMP within an S-shaped pocket formed by its asymmetric internal loop on complex formation (Figure 10, left) [17,19]. The AMP is integrated through intrercalation in an extremely stable GNRA-like hairpin fold (where N is any nucleotide and R is a purine), with the ligand aligned through AMP-G mismatch formation. The flanking helical stems are aligned at an angle of = llO", resulting in an L-shaped structure for the AMP-RNA aptamer complex. By contrast, the ATP-binding DNA aptamer binds two equivalents of AMP within a continuous six-mismatch binding pocket adopted by its asymmetric internal bubble on complex formation (Figure 10, right). The AMPS intercalate into a rectangular minor groove binding pocket adopted by the zippered-up mismatch-containing helix, with the ligands aligned through AMP-G mismatch formation. The flanking helical stems are slightly bent in the AMP-DNA aptamer complex.
Similarities in the recognition alignments and ligand binding pockets of AMP-RNA and AMP-DNA aptamer complexes

Significance
Structural analyses of nucleic acid aptamer complexes have already provided a wealth of information on nucleic acid architecture and molecular recognition. Such complexes generally involve nucleic acids up to 40mers in length making them ideal candidates for structural characterization in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The major focus to date has been on RNA aptamer complexes, with only two examples of the structures of DNA aptamer complexes published to date. One of these is an X-ray structure of the a-thrombin-DNA aptamer complex [43] and the other is an NMR structure of the L-argininamide-DNA aptamer complex which involves adaptive binding [44]. The current structure of the AMP-DNA aptamer complex adds to this limited data set and provides the first opportunity of comparing the solution structures of complexes of RNA and DNA aptamers targeted to the same ligand. The solution structure of the AMP-DNA aptamer complex unexpectedly contains two equivalents of bound AMP positioned in an unprecedented expanded and rectangular minor groove binding site composed solely of base mismatches and three-base platforms with extensive cross-strand stacking. This complex is distinctly different from the structures of antitumor drug dimers bound to widened DNA minor grooves composed of Watson-Crick base pairs reported previously [35-381 and represents a new paradigm for molecular recognition involving minor groove targeting of DNA. A comparison with the previously solved solution structure of the AMP-RNA aptamer complex establishes that the AMP-DNA and [17,191 AMP-RNA aptamer complexes, with their different binding site sequences, secondary structure folds and ligand stoichiometries, adopt distinct architectures, but, surprisingly, have identical recognition pairing alignments and common structural elements that define their binding pockets.

Despite the distinct architectures of the solution structures of the AMP-RNA aptamer [ 17,191 and AMP-DNA aptamer complexes (Figure 10) and their distinct stoichiometries, there are striking common features associated with the three-dimensional topology of the binding pocket and the recognition alignment. Thus, for both AMP-RNA aptamer [ 17,191 and AMP-DNA aptamer complexes, the recognition alignment involves AMP.G mismatch formation through a pair of hydrogen bonds between the Watson-Crick edge of AMP and the minor groove edge of guanine (Figure 1 la). Further, the AMP-G mismatch alignment stacks over a reversed Hoogsteen G-G mismatch in one direction in the structures of the AMP-RNA aptamer (Figure lla, left) and AMP-DNA aptamer (Figure 1la, right) complexes. The AMP-G alignment stacks with an adenine in the opposite direction in both complexes, though the alignment of this adenine is distinct in AMP-RNA (Figure llb, left) and AMP-DNA aptamer (Figure 1lb, right) complexes. The stacking patterns down the helix axis centered about the recognition AMP.G mismatch site demonstrate that the purine base of the intercalated AMP exhibits a greater overlap with flanking purines in the AMP-RNA aptamer complex (Figure 1 lb, left) than in the AMP-DNA aptamer complex (Figure 11b, right).

The 27-mer DNA aptamer 1 (Figure 1) and 14-mer DNA aptamer 2 (Figure 2a) sequences were synthesized on a 10 uM scale on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA synthesizer using solid phase pcyanophosphoramidite chemistry and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. The AMP was added gradually to the DNA aptamers and complex formation monitored by recording imino proton spectra at 4°C; separate resonances were observed for the free and bound DNA aptamers.

Nonexchangeable interproton distance restraints were obtained from the buildup of NOE cross-peak volumes in NOESY data sets (50, 90, 150 and 200 ms mixing times) on the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex in D,O buffer at 10°C and bounds were set between + 1 Oo/, and + 20% of the calculated distances using the fixed cytidine H5-H6 reference distance of 2.45 A. Non-stereospecific assignments were treated with r6 averaging. Interproton distance restraints involving exchangeable protons of the same complex were obtained from NOESY spectra (90 and 120 ms mixing times) in H,O buffer at 4°C with bounds set between + 15% and + 20% of the calculated distance using the thymine imino to adenine H2 reference distance of 2.91 A across an A.T base pair.

Distance geometry and molecular dynamics calculations
1. 2. A set of 300 initial structures of the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex were generated by the X-PLOR [451 based metric matrix distance geometry (DG) protocol guided by the available distance restraints. Hydrogen-bonding distance restraints were imposed to align the experimentally identified stem Watson-Crick pairs (* 0.10 A) and stem wobble T12.Gl6 pair (kO.15 A) during the DG calculations. These structures were quantitatively scored to select 21 structures with the least NOE violations, acceptable covalent geometry, and favorable van der Waals energy. The X-PLOR-based [45] restrained molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were carried out in two cycles using the simulated annealing protocol and the CHARMM force field with reduced phosphate charges. Additional hydrogen-bonding distance restraints (rt 0.15 A) were imposed at this stage in protocol 1 to align the experimentally identified sheared G5.A23 and G18.AlO mismatch pairs, GS.AMP, and G22.AMP recognition pairs and reversed Hoogsteen G8.Gl9 and G6.G21 mismatch pairs within the core binding region of the complex. Each cycle of restrained MD simulations were initially carried out at 300K with a force constant of 1 kcal mol-lA-n on all experimentally obtained distance restraints. The structure was subjected to 500 cycles of energy minimization and was slowly heated to 1 OOOK in 5 ps (0.5 ps per 50K increase). The force constants of the experimentally obtained distance restraints were slowly scaled up to 32 (nonelchangeable protons) and 16 (exchangeable protons) kcal mol-`A-*, over a period of 10 ps. The system was allowed to evolve for another 10 ps at 1 OOOK and next cooled gradually to 300K over 5 ps (0.5 fs time step) with retention of the full scale of distance restraints and subsequently equilibrated for 12 ps at 300K. The coordinates were averaged over the last 5 ps and the resulting coordinates subjected to 20 cycles (100 steps each cycle) of conjugate gradient energy minimization. Seven final distance-refined structures were selected on the basis of the criterion of low restraints violation and low total energy. A second set of computations were undertaken that avoided the potential biasing of the resulting refinements through introduction of restraints involving experimentally defined mismatch pairs at the beginning of the distance-restrained MD calculations on the complex. These computations (designated protocol 2) did not introduce hydrogenbonding distance restraints involving the mismatch pairs during any stage of the distance-restrained MD calculations. Distance-restrained MD protocols 1 and 2 independently yielded the same family of refined structures exhibiting similar r.m.s.d. values (Table 2) for the AMP-27-mer DNA aptamer 1 complex.
