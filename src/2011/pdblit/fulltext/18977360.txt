Pellagra is endemic among poor people whose staple is jowar (sorghum vulgare) in Deccan region of India. It was reported earlier that in patients suffering from pellagra (Pellagrins) the capacity of erythrocytes to synthesize in vitro nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD) from nicotinic acid was impaired (1). The biochemical defect leading to reduced synthesis of NAD has not so far been studied. Synthesis of NAD from nicotinic acid has been shown to proceed according to the following pathway in human erythrocytes (2).

A lowered synthesis of NAD in erythrocytes of pellagrins may be due either to a reduced activity of the enzymes involved in NAD synthesis or to a deficiency of ATP. A study was therefore undertaken to investigate the biochemical defect leading to lowered synthesis of NAD in erythrocytes of pellagrins. The study included the following measurements on intact erythrocytes in vitro: (a) Incorporation of 14C-nicotinic acid into NaMN, NaAD, and NAD; (b) rate of transfer of prelabeled NaMN to NaAD; (c) ATP concentration; and (d) rate of glycolysis. Nicotinate phosphoribosyl transferase activity in the haemolysates, was also measured.

EXPERIMENTAL Materials Chemicals. 14C-carboxyl labeled nicotinic acid (specific activity 2.25 mCi/mmole) was obtained from Isotope Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Bombay, India. Unlabeled nicotinic acid was purchased from British Drug House Co., India. S-Phosphorylribose-lpyrophosphate (PRPP) dimagnesium dihydrate, B grade, was obtained from Calbiochem, San Diego, California. Adenosine 5'-triphosphate disodium salt, crystalline, was from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Lithium lactate was from Dr. Theodor Schuchardt, GMBH & Co., Chemische, Fabrik, Munchen, West Germany. Subjects. Fifty-four adult subjects suffering from pellagra, and 42 normal subjects of similar age group were investigated. The subjects with pellagra had the characteristic dermatitis. These subjects were admitted to the hospital as inpatients and treated with 300 mgm of nicotinic acid per day administered in three equal divided doses. They received a diet which provided about 45 gm protein and 2500 kcals per day. Methods Blood Collection and Processing. Fasting samples of blood were collected in all the subjects immediately on admission into sterile, heparinised tubes kept chilled in ice. A second sample of blood was drawn after the pellagrins had been treated successfully. Immediately after collection, the blood was centrifuged in cold at 4" at 2500 rpm and the plasma and buffy coat were removed. The cells were washed four times with 4 volumes of Krebs-Ringer-phosphate buffer pH 7.4, and were suspended in equal volume of the same buffer. Preparation of haemolysates. The washed packed erythrocytes were haemolysed by freezing at -30" and thawing at 0" twice. Five volumes of the haemolysate were mixed with 1 volume of Na-phosphate buffer, 0.1 M pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 20,OOOg for 60 minutes at 0" and the clear haemolysate was separated carefully from the pellet. Incorporation of W-Nicotinic Acid into Niacin Nucleotides of Erythrocytes in Vitro. The method used for in vitro synthesis of niacin nucleotides by erythrocytes was based on the procedure described by Leder and Handler (3) and Preiss and Handler (4). The incubation medium was similar to the one described by Raghuramulu et al. (1) except that in the present study radioactive 14C-nicotinic acid (0.1 &i) was used in place of cold nicotinic acid. Incubation was carried out at 37" with mild shaking for different periods of time and the reaction was stopped by keeping the tubes in boiling water bath for 2 minutes. The tubes were immediately placed in

ice, and then centrifuged to remove the protein. An aliquot of the supernatant was passed over a column (0.5 x 2 cm) of Dowex 50 x 2 H+(200-400 mesh) and eluated with 2.5 ml of water (5). The unreacted radioactive nicotinic acid was retained on the column, and the nucleotides formed were completely eluted. Incorporation of 14C-nicotinic acid into total nucleotides was determined by counting the radioactivity in an aliquot of the eluate. The rest of the eluate was lyophilized and the residue was dissolved in 0.2 ml of water. The nucleotides in the eluate were separated by paper chromatography (6,7) using the solvent system of three parts of 1 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) and seven parts of 95% (v/v) ethanol. The chromatogram was dried at room temperature and cut into l-cm strips, and the radioactivity in the strips was counted in toluene scintillator. There were only two radioactive spots, one corresponding to NaMN and the other corresponding to NaAD + NAD. NAD was estimated fluorimetrically in a portion of the original extract. To determine the amount of NAD synthesized correction was made for the NAD present in the unincubated cells (zero time blank) (1). Label Chasing Experiment. For labeling NaMN of erythrocytes in situ, the erythrocyte suspension in Krebs-Ringer-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was incubated with 14C-nicotinic acid, 0.5 pmole (1 #.Zi) glucose 120 pmoles, and 0.1 M Krebs-Ringer-phosphate buffer, (pH 7.4) in a total volume of 1.9 ml at 37". After 1 hour, an aliquot of the medium was withdrawn for measuring the incorporation of 14C-nicotinic acid into total nucleotides as described earlier. The rest of the ceil suspension was centrifuged in cold at 4" and repeatedly washed with Krebs-Ringerphosphate buffer to remove the free 14C-nicotinic acid from the cells. The cells (1.5 ml) were again incubated in the NAD synthesizing medium containing only cold nicotinic acid. The incubation was carried out for 45 and 150 minutes and the reaction was stopped by heat denaturation of the cells. After removing the protein by centrifngation, 100 ~1 of the supernatant was spotted on Whatman No. 1 filter paper, nucleotides were separated and the radioactivity in the fractions was counted.
Assay of Nicotinate Phosphoribosyl Transferase Activity (EC

2.4.2.11). Nicotinate phosphoribosyl transferase activity was assayed essentially according to the procedure of Preiss and Handler (2). The incubation medium contained haemolysate 0.5 ml, potassium phosphate buffer 0.1 M pH 7.4, 20 pmoles, "C-nicotinic acid 0.37 pmoles (0.1 PCi), MgCl, 5 pmoles, and PRPP 0.47 pmoles in a total volume of 1.1 ml. The incubation was carried out at 37" in a shaking water bath for 15 and 30 minutes. The reaction was stopped by keeping the tubes in boiling water bath for 1 minute, and then in ice. The protein was removed by centrifugation, and the unreacted nicotinic acid was removed by passing through

a Dowex 50 column as described earlier and the radioactive NaMN in the eluate was determined. Basal Levels and Generation of ATP in Erythrocytes. The cell suspension was incubated in NAD synthesizing system for 0, 0.5, 1, 4, and 18 hours at 37". The concentration of ATP in the cells at the end of each period was estimated by the method of Beutler (8) but using a liquid scintillation spectrometer for measuring light output. Glycolytic Activity of Erythrocytes. The cell suspension was incubated in NAD synthesizing system at 37". At 0,0.5, 1,4, and 18 hours, suitable aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and added to 5.0 ml of 10% (W/V) trichloroacetic acid. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was used for lactate estimation by the method of Barker and Summerson (9). Radioactivity was measured in all cases with a Packard Tricarb Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer (model 2211) by using either a dioxan-based scintillator fluid or a toluene scintillator. Statistical analysis of results was carried out either by paired t ,test or by using analysis of Variance and Fisher's F test. RESULTS Incorporation of 14C-nicotinic acid into total nucleotides and different fractions are shown in Table 1. Incorporation of 14C-nicotinic acid into total nucleotides of erythrocytes of normals and pellagrins was similar at the end of 1 hour. However at 6 and 21 hours the inqprporation into total nucleotides was significantly lower in erythrocytes of pellagrins than in erythrocytes of normals. This lowering was mostly accounted for by a decrease in dinucleotide content. Amount of nicotinate mononucleotide formed in erythrocytes of pellagrins was identical with that formed in erythrocytes of normals at 1 hour indicating that the initial rate of conversion of nicotinic acid to NaMN in the two groups was similar. While in normals the amount of NaMN formed increased up to 6 hours and then declined by 21 hours, in pellagrins, it increased to a lower extent at 6 hours and remained unchanged between 6 and 21 hours. Amounts of dinucleotides formed was lower at 6 and 21 hours in pellagrins as compared to normals. The differences were statistically significant only at 21 hours when the data were analyzed after making correction for differences in NaMN pool. This would suggest that conversion of mononucleotide to dinucleotides is less efficient in erythrocytes of pellagrins. Both NaAD and NAD formation was lower in pellagrins at 6 and 21 hours. There was no detectable amount of NAD at 1 hour of incubation and most of the NAD was formed between 6 and 21 hours. NAD formed as percent of dinucleotides at 21 hours was similar in both the groups indicating that the rate of

conversion of NaAD to NAD was not defective in erythrocytes of pellagrins. Results of the label chasing experiment are given in Table 2. Incorporation of 14C-nicotinic acid into nucleotides after 1 hour of incubation was similar in both the groups and 80% of the label was found in NaMN. When the cells containing labeled NaMN were reincubated in a NAD synthesizing system containing cold nicotinic acid the amount of labeled NaMN converted into dinucleotides at 45 and 150 minutes was significantly lower in erythrocytes of pellagrins (6.1 and 18.2%) than in erythrocytes of normals (11.5 and 38.5%). The results of this experiment confirm that the efficiency of conversion of mononucleotide to dinucleotide is impaired in pellagrins. The efficiency of conversion of NaMN to dinucleotides in erythrocytes of pellagrins increased after therapy. Activity of nicotinate phosphoribosyl transferase in erythrocytes of pellagrins was not different from that in erythrocytes of normals (Table 3). The enzyme activity was again determined in ten of these subjects after recovery. The mean values were not significantly different when tested by paired t test. Levels of ATP and lactate when erythrocytes were incubated with NAD synthesizing system for different intervals are shown in Table 4. Total nucleotides formed at 24 hours were also estimated simultaneously. Basal levels of ATP were significantly lower in erythrocytes of pellagrins as compared to levels found in erythrocytes of normal subjects. Levels of ATP in erythrocytes of pellagrins increased significantly after treatment. During incubation, ATP levels increased during the first hour and declined subsequently. ATP levels in erythrocytes of pellagrins were significantly lower than the corresponding values in normal subjects at all the time intervals studied. Basal levels of lactate were similar in erythrocytes of pellagrins and of normals and the levels did not change after treatment. On the other hand, the amount of lactate produced during incubation at every point studied up to 4 hours was signifiTABLE NICOTINATE 3 IN ERYTHROCYTES

cantly lower in pellagrins as compared to normals. The rate of lactate production in treated cases of pellagra was similar to that in normals. These results indicate that the rate of glycolysis is lower in erythrocytes of pellagrins than in erythrocytes of normals. DISCUSSIONS The capacity of erythrocytes of pellagrins to synthesize NAD in vitro from nicotinic acid was shown to be impaired (1). The biochemical basis of the reduced synthesis of NAD in erythrocytes of pellagrins however was not clear. The results of the present study indicate that while the rates of formation of NaMN from nicotinic acid and of NAD from NaAD were similar in erythrocytes of normals and pellagrins, the rate of conversion of NaMN to NaAD was lower in erythrocytes of pellagrins. Measurement of nicotinate phosphoribosyl transferase in haemolysate indicated that the first enzyme in the conversion of nicotinic acid to NAD was normal in erythrocytes of pellagrins. The second enzyme, NaMN adenyl transferase could not be measured for technical reasons. However, label chasing experiment confirmed that rate of conversion of NaMN to NaAD was lower in erythrocytes of pellagra subjects. A decreased conversion of NaMN to NaAD in erythrocytes of pellagrins resulted in a higher proportion of NaMN. Increased levels of NaMN is known to inhibit the activity of nicotinate phosphoribosyl transferase (10). Therefore a higher proportion of NaMN in the cells may be expected to decrease the rate of formation of total nucleotides with time. The decreased conversion of NaMN to NaAD in erythrocytes of pellagrins indicate either a lower activity of NaMN adenyl transferase, or a decreased availability of ATP as the intact cells depend upon ATP generated in situ for this reaction. However measurement of ATP formed during incubation of cells in the NAD synthesizing system indicated that ATP may not be a limiting factor for the conversion of NaMN to NaAD in the erythrocytes of pellagrins. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (1) The label chasing experiment showed that the rate of conversion of preformed NaMN to NaAD was found to be lowered as early as 45 minutes. This decrease was observed at a time when the rate of formation and concentration of ATP was still high: (2) Reduction in the nucleotide formation was observed even at 4 hours of incubation. At 4 hours, the rare offormation of ATP as computed from lactate formation was of the order of 3.4 x IO2 and 3.9 x lo* pmoles per 100 ml cells in pellagrins at the time of admission, and at the time of discharge and 4.7 x IO2 in normals, which we presume is sufficient enough for nucleotide synthesis at this period. Thus it would appear that the lowered in vitro synthesis of NAD in erythrocytes of pellagrins is due to lowered activity of the enzyme NaMN adenyl transferase.

AND

RAO

Another observation of interest is the lower glycolytic activity in erythrocytes of pellagrins. Associated with lowered glycolysis, the basal levels of ATP as well as ATP generation were found to be lower in the erythrocytes of pellagrins. The explanation for this lowered glycolytic activity is not clear. Pellagra among sorghum eaters has been reported to be due to excess of leucine in sorghum (11). In vitro addition of leucine to erythrocytes or leucine feeding to normal subjects resulted in a lowering of erythrocyte glycolytic activity (12). Serum free copper levels have been shown to be elevated in patients with pellagra and normals fed leucine (13). Increase in plasma copper levels has been shown to reduce erythrocyte glycolysis (14). It would appear that excess leucine in the diets of pellagrins may be causally related to reduced rate of glycolysis observed in their erythrocytes.
SUMMARY

Erythrocytes of subjects with pellagra exhibit impaired synthesis of NAD from nicotinic acid in vitro. A detailed time course study of in vitro incorporation of 14C-nicotinic acid into NAD and its intermediates namely nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN), nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) was made in erythrocytes of patients with pellagra and normal subjects. The incorporation of 14C-nicotinic acid into the total nucleotides (NAD + NaAD + NaMN) was significantly reduced in the erythrocytes of pellagrins at 6 and 21 hours. Relatively more radioactivity was found in NaMN during these periods indicating thereby, that the conversion of NaMN to NaAD may be defective in pellagra. This was confirmed by label chasing experiment, in which NaMN of the intact cells was prelabeled with 14C-nicotinic acid, and its further conversion to NaAD was followed in vitro. The activity of nicotinate phosphoribosyl transferase, was normal in the erythrocytes of pellagrins. Concentration of ATP and glycolytic activity of the erythrocytes were investigated under conditions for NAD synthesis. A significant reduction in the basal levels of ATP was observed in pellagrins. As compared to normals, the rate of glycolytic activity, and the levels of ATP during NAD synthesis, was significantly lower in the erythrocytes of pellagrins. From the data obtained, it was concluded that the fall in ATP concentration found in the erythrocytes of pellagrins may not be the limiting factor for the optimal synthesis of NAD. Instead, the defect in lowered NAD synthesis, may be due to reduced activity of the enzyme NaMN adenyl transferase, which converts NaMN to NaAD.
