In general, many cases of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia are due to HHM. In patients with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM), it has been reported that plasma parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were elevated, while plasma PTH and active vitamin D3 levels were suppressed. Our patient showed hypercalcemia with a concurrent increase in plasma and tumor tissue PTHrP and PTH concentrations and also high cAMP and low 1-25(OH)2VD3 levels in the plasma. These data suggest that the hypercalcemia exhibited by our patient was consistent with HHM due to lung cancer and its liver metastasis. Moreover, diagnostic imaging and autopsy findings showed no appreciable lesions of the parathyroid gland. In addition, histopathologic examination of the primary and metastatic tumors revealed the existence of PTH immunohistochemically stained with anti-PTH antibodies, suggesting an ectopic­PTHproducing lung tumor. From these data, our patient was diagnosed with a rare case of lung cancer, which produced both ectopic PTH and PTHrP. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

ALIGNANCY-ASSOCIATED hypercalcemia is a complication in a wide range of cancers, from solid cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, to malignant hematologic tumors. Hypercalcemia caused by malignant tumors has been conventionally classified into local osteolytic hypercalcemia (LOH) and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). It is believed that LOH is induced by bone destruction due to a malignant tumor, while HHM is caused by the effect of humoral factors produced by the tumor in its calcium metabolism. In 1987, Moseley et al,1 Strewler et al,2 and Burtis et al3 purified a protein with parathyroid hormone (PTH)-like activity from the tissues of lung, renal cell, and breast carcinomas and the supernatants of those cultured cells, respectively. Suva et al4 cloned a protein from cDNA, identified its amino acid sequences, and showed that its N-terminal structure was homologous to that of PTH. The protein, known as PTH-related protein (PTHrP), shows a similar affinity for PTH receptors as PTH and appears to exhibit the same physiologic activity. Various patients with HHM were analyzed, and it was clarified that PTHrP was a major causative agent of HHM.5 Eighty percent of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia is due to HHM. However, ectopic­PTH-producing tumors are rarely the cause of hypercalcemia. The present report describes a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung who was admitted to our university hospital as an emergency because of a remarkably high level of plasma calcium induced by concurrently elevated PTH and PTHrP levels. The excessive production of both ectopic PTH and PTHrP in the lung tumor tissue was also confirmed by autopsy examination of the patient.
CASE REPORT

M

tests revealed a calcium (Ca) level of 17.6 mg/dL and his chest x-ray showed a pulmonary tumor shadow. Physical examination revealed as follows: body height, 156 cm; body weight, 45.3 kg; blood pressure, 150/70 mm Hg; pulse rate, 84/minute, regular; and consciousness, unclear. Neither jaundice nor anemia were observed in the conjunctiva. His respiratory sounds were clear, and no heart murmur was audible. The liver was palpable across a 3-finger breadth below the right costal margin in the right upper abdominal quadrant. There was no pretibial pitting edema or anasarca. The patient did not complain of ostealgia. Laboratory tests on admission: anemia, liver dysfunction, and relatively mild renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], 28 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.3 mg/dL) with preservation of urine volume were observed. Serum electrolytes showed a high Ca level (16.6 mg/dL [verified by serum albumin concentration], ionized Ca, 7.41 mg/dL). Urinary Ca excretion was also high (Ca, 476 mg/d [normal value, 50 to 300], urinary protein, 256 mg/d [normal value, 80 to 150], urinary creatinine, 256 mg/d [normal value, 70 to 160]). Mild metabolic alkalosis was observed on blood gas analysis with room air (pH 7.449; PCO2, 43.1 mm Hg; PO2, 78.6 mm Hg; base excess (BE), 6.1 mmol/L; bicarbonate [HCO3], 30.3 mmol/L; oxygen saturation, 95.7%). A chest x-ray revealed a tumor shadow 6 cm in diameter with an irregular margin at the right hilus. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest showed mediastinal infiltration by the tumor in the right lung lobe region (Fig 1), but the other region showed no bone metastatic lesion.

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed no hepatic tumors or other abnormalities. Concerning his progress, serum Ca level normalized after he was treated with electrolyte infusion, diuretics, calcitonin, and pamidronate disodium. Hemodialysis was also applied to reduce his high Ca level (Fig 2). However, the patient died of hepatic failure complicated with disseminated intravascular coagulation 21 days after admission. The autopsy examination revealed a 6-cm lung carcinoma in the upper right lobe with tumor metastases in the liver and both lungs. Hemorrhagic ascites and pleural fluids were also observed. Hepatic tumor invasion was observed. The thyroid and parathyroid glands were normal size and weight. The histopathologic examination for these glands also confirmed that the parathyroid glands were normal, and no ectopic parathyroid glands were found in the mediastinum. Histologic examination of the lung tumor mass (Fig 3A) showed a solid lung tumor accompanied by extensive necrosis. The tumor was characterized by proliferation of atypical cells with a cobblestone-like and, in parts, onion-like arrangement. The diagnosis was moderately well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with high mitotic nuclei. The histologic findings of the liver tumor (Fig 3B) were similar to those in the lung, suggesting hematogenous and lymphatic metastases of a moderately well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. In the tumor, relatively well-differentiated and spindle-shaped tumor cells were stained positively with PTH antibodies, which did not cross-react with PTHrP (Fig 4A), compared with negative control staining (Fig 4B), and electron microscopy (Fig 5) showed scattered secretory granules inside the tumor cells. PTH and PTHrP concentrations concurrently increased in the lung and liver tumor tissues (the methods for PTH and PTHrP measurement in the lung and liver tissues are shown in the legend to Table 2) as did those in the plasma. We tried to confirm PTH and PTHrP mRNAs using a cDNA probe prepared by Dr H. Katagami,

Miyazaki Medical College, Miyazaki, Japan, and PTHrP staining was tried using a PTHrP antibody prepared by Dr H. Katagami and a PTHrP monocronal antibody from Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA. However, as PTHrP is unstable, this was unsuccessful probably because the specimens were obtained from the patient at autopsy.
DISCUSSION

In patients with HHM, it was reported that plasma PTHrP and cAMP levels were elevated, while plasma PTH and active vitamin D3 levels were suppressed. In HHM patients, the concept of ectopic­PTH-producing tumors was suggented, but this idea has been rejected because PTHrP has been identified. Cases of malignant tumors associated with high plasma PTH levels should be suspected as malignant tumors complicated

with primary hyperparathyroidism. The diagnosis of an ectopic­PTH-producing tumor should be made only after primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism can be ruled out. Our patient showed hypercalcemia with a concurrent increase in plasma and tumor tissue PTHrP and PTH concentrations and also high cAMP and low 1-25(OH)2VD3 levels in the plasma. Whether or not the low urinary cAMP level was due to a defect in the nephrogenic action of PTH and PHTrP or hypercalcemia treatment-induced renal dysfunction is unclear, although these data suggest that our patient's hypercalcemia was consistent with HHM due to lung cancer and its liver metastasis. Therefore, the cause of the elevated plasma PTH level was thoroughly investigated to rule out hyperparathyroidism. Diagnostic imaging showed no appreciable lesions of the parathyroid gland, which was confirmed at autopsy. In addition,

In the tumor, relatively well-differentiated and spindle-shaped tumor cells are stained positively with PTH antibodies from Bio-mega Co, Ltd, Sostercity, CA. (B) Negative control staining did not show any visible staining. The cross-reactivity of the antibody used for PTH with PTHrP was lacking.

histopathologic examination of the primary and metastatic tumors also revealed the existence of PTH immunohistochemically stained with anti-PTH antibodies, suggesting an ectopic­ PTH-producing lung tumor. There have been many reports of ectopic­PTH-producing tumors since 1987, including small cell carcinoma of the lung by Yoshimoto et al,6 primitive neuroectodermal tumor by Strewler et al,7 ovarian cancer by Nussbaum et al,8 cholangiocellular carcinoma by Baba et al,9 and thymoma by Rizzoli et al.10 The tumor in our patient was histologically identified as a squamous cell carcinoma and was neuron-specific enolase (NSE)-positive. The presence of secretory granules inside the tumor cells was confirmed by electron microscopy. The tumors in the patients of Yoshimoto et al6 and Strewler et al7 were histologically characterized by positive NSE staining, but their tissue PTH production was unclear. PTHrP consists of 141 amino acids and its actions on the mid- and C-terminal are largely unknown. However, the N-

terminal structure is homologous to that of PTH, which consists of 84 amino acids. Injection of PTHrP N-terminal fragments into rats resulted in an increase in 1-25(OH)2VD11 unlike 3 HHM, and the PTHrP C-terminal inhibited osteoclasts.12 These findings indicate that the pathophysiologic changes in HHM cannot be explained by the PTH-like activity of PTHrP alone. In the patient reported by Strewler et al,7 the blood PTHrP concentration was slightly elevated, and the presence of PTHrP mRNA in the tumor tissue was confirmed. They assessed the tumor's correlation with hypercalcemia, but did not discuss the change in the plasma 1-25(OH)2VD3 level. The normal circulation level of PHTrP is considerably lower than the level of PTH. Therefore, it is uncertain that PTHrP has some role in maintaining calcium homeostasis. However, PTHrP is widely present in fetal tissues, and its gene is expressed in developing and adult tissues, suggesting it has some

The tissues were homogenized in an 8 mol/L urea buffer containing 0.2 N HCl for the tissue PTH assay, and PTH was extracted according to the method reported previously.14 For the tissue PTHrP assay, the tissues were homogenized in 1.0 mol/L acetic acid, and PTHrP was extracted according to the previously reported method.15 The minimal detectable values were 0.1 ng/g (wet weight tissue) in c-terminal PTH, 50 pg/g in sensitive PTH, and 25 pg/g in intact PTH in lung and liver tissues, while that of PTHrP was 0.03 pmol/g in lung and liver tissues. PTH or PTHrP antibody did not cross-react with each other. C-terminal, sensitive, and intact PTHs were undetectable in normal lung and liver tissues. PTHrP was also undetectable in normal lung and liver tissues.

functions in development and in normal physiology at the cell or tissue level. Further studies on developmental expression of PTH and PTHrP linked to gene sequence, such as Southern and Western blotting analyses,13 may allow us to draw the inference of gene function as an underlying cause of PTH and PTHrP production by the tumor in this patient. Our patient had a rare case of lung cancer, which produced

both ectopic PTH and PTHrP, of which the pathophysiologic changes are of particular interest when considering HHM.
