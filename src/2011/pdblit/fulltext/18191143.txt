Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and lactoperoxidase (LPO) are important constituents of the innate immune system of mammals. These heme enzymes belong to the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily and catalyze the oxidation of thiocyanate, bromide and nitrite to hypothiocyanate, hypobromous acid and nitrogen dioxide that are toxic for invading pathogens. In order to gain a better understanding of the observed differences in substrate specificity and oxidation capacity in relation to heme and protein structure, a comprehensive spectro-electrochemical investigation was performed. The reduction potential (E°0 ) of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple of EPO and LPO was determined to be À126 mV and À176 mV, respectively (25 °C, pH 7.0). Variable temperature experiments show that EPO and LPO feature different reduction thermodynamics. In particular, reduction of ferric EPO is enthalpically and entropically disfavored, whereas in LPO the entropic term, which selectively stabilizes the oxidized form, prevails on the enthalpic term that favors reduction of Fe(III). The data are discussed with respect to the architecture of the heme cavity and the substrate channel. Comparison with published data for myeloperoxidase demonstrates the effect of heme to protein linkages and heme distortion on the redox chemistry of mammalian peroxidases and in consequence on the enzymatic properties of these physiologically important oxidoreductases.

Introduction Vertebrate peroxidases constitute a subfamily of the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily [1]. The main clades of this subfamily are represented by myeloperoxidases (MPOs)1 and eosinophil peroxidases (EPOs), that are well separated from the lactoperoxidase (LPO) branch. These soluble heme peroxidases are important constituents of the innate immune system and are released when pathogens and parasites invade the organisms [2­4]. Closely related with their role in host defense is their enzymatic activity. They oxidize small anionic molecules, such as halides (chloride and bromide), thiocyanate, and nitrite to the corresponding

oxidation products [2­5]. These involve e.g., hypohalous acids or nitrogen dioxide, that is, (strong) halogenating and nitrating antimicrobial oxidants. Clearly segregated from these three clades and thus distantly related with MPO, EPO, LPO are thyroid peroxidases (TPOs) that are crucial in hormone biosynthesis [6]. These four heme oxidoreductases are found in all mammals including man, and differ in their ability to bind and oxidize their small inorganic substrate molecules [5]. X-ray structures of mammalian peroxidases have been published for human myeloperoxidase [7­9], as well as for caprine lactoperoxidase [10,11], whereas the three-dimensional structures of both EPO and TPO are still unknown. In both EPO and LPO, as well as in all vertebrate peroxidases, the methyl substituents of pyrrole rings A and C of heme b form two ester bonds with highly conserved distal aspartate and glutamate residues [3,7­12,14] (Fig. 1B and D). The existence of these covalent bonds disturbs the symmetry and planarity of the prosthetic group thereby modulating the spectroscopic and redox properties of the metalloproteins [14,15]. This is very pronounced with myeloperoxidases that are singular in having an additional sulfonium ion linkage between the heme 2-vinyl group and a conserved methionine [7­9,14] (Fig. 1A and C). X-ray structures of both LPO and MPO clearly show that the heme iron in its resting (ferric)

Fig. 1. Covalent binding pattern of heme in (A) myeloperoxidase (MPO) and (B) in lactoperoxidase (LPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO). In MPO the heme is covalently bonded via two ester bonds to D94 and E242, as well as via a sulfonium ion linkage to M243. In addition the conserved distal residues H95, R239 and Q91, as well as proximal H336 and N421 are shown (C). With the exception of the MPO-typical sulfonium ion linkage, the same residues are conserved in LPO (D) and ­ suggested by sequence alignment [15] in EPO. Figures (E) and (F) depict the conserved water molecules in the distal heme side of MPO and LPO. This panel was constructed using the following coordinates deposited in the Protein Data Bank.

high-spin state is positioned out of plane toward the proximal histidine, that is hydrogen bonded to the NH2-group of a fully conserved asparagine [9]. This proximal heme site architecture is a typical feature for vertebrate peroxidases. Furthermore, the distal site of both LPO and MPO accommodates a conserved distal gluta-

mine residue (besides the peroxidase-typical His­Arg couple) and a complex hydrogen bonding network that includes several conserved water molecules leading from the substrate channel to the heme iron, which supports halide delivery and binding (Fig. 1E and F). Moreover, an array of conserved water molecules

might facilitate proton release from hydrogen peroxide to the surface of the protein [7,10,11,16]. The H2O2-mediated two-electron oxidation of peroxidases to compound I [oxoferryl species, Fe(IV)@O, plus porphyryl or protein radical] requires stabilization of the ferric state that rapidly reacts with H2O2. This is usually guaranteed by the reduction potentials (E°0 ) of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple, which range from À180 to À300 mV (vs. SHE) [14,17­21]. The E°0 value of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple of LPO has been reported to be À170 mV [17], whereas that for MPO is distinctively high (+5 mV) [18], being similar to those of globins, due to the electron-withdrawing sulfonium ion linkage [14,15]. No redox data about EPO and TPO are available so far. Here, the standard reduction potential E°0 [(Fe(III)/Fe(II)] of EPO and the changes in enthalpy, DH0 , and entropy, DS0 , accompanyrc rc ing Fe(III) to Fe(II) reduction in EPO and LPO have been determined for the first time by spectro-electrochemical experiments carried out at different temperatures. These thermodynamic data are compared with those of MPO [18] and some members of the non-animal heme peroxidase superfamily [19­21] and discussed with respect to structural and functional differences between the two superfamilies as well as between the four clades of mammalian peroxidases, obtaining new hints concerning the molecular determinants of E°0 in this important class of metalloenzymes.

Nernst plots consisted of at least five points and were found to be linear, with a slope consistent with a one-electron reduction process. Results The electronic spectra for bovine lactoperoxidase and human eosinophil peroxidase at different applied potentials in the OTTLE cell (25 °C, pH 7) are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding Nernst plots (insets to Fig. 2). The electronic absorption spectrum of Fe(III) LPO shows a fairly sharp Soret band at 412 nm and maxima in the visible range at 501 nm, 545 nm, 595 nm, and 631 nm, very similar to those reported in the literature [13,14,31].

Materials and methods Lactoperoxidase from bovine milk was purchased as a lyophilized powder (Sigma Chemical Co. type L-8257, purity index A412/ A280 > 0.9). Essentially salt-free protein was dissolved in 100 mM phosphate buffer and 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.0), and concentration was determined by using the extinction coefficient 112,000 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 412 nm [22]. Lyophilized salt-free human eosinophil peroxidase with a purity index (A413/A280) > 1 was obtained from Planta Natural Products (http://www.planta.at). Its concentration was determined at Soret maximum at 413 nm (110,000 MÀ1 cmÀ1) [23]. All chemicals were reagent grade. Spectroelectrochemistry. All experiments were carried out in a home-made OTTLE cell [18­21,24]. The three-electrode configuration was realized with a gold minigrid working electrode (Buckbee-Mears, Chicago, IL), a Ag/AgCl/KClsat microreference electrode, separated from the working solution by a Vycor set, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The reference electrode was calibrated against a saturated calomel electrode before and after each set of measurements. All potentials are referenced to the SHE. Potentials were applied across the OTTLE cell with an Amel model 2053 potentiostat/galvanostat. The functioning of the OTTLE cell was checked by measuring the reduction potential of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c in conditions similar to those used in the present work [18­21,25­27]. The E°0 value was identical to that determined by cyclic voltammetry (+260 mV) [27]. The temperature of the OTTLE cell, controlled with a circulating water bath, was measured with a Cu-costan microthermocouple. UV­vis spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary C50 spectrophotometer. Variable temperature experiments were carried out using a ``non-isothermal" cell configuration [18­21,24­29], namely, the temperature of the reference electrode and the counter electrode was kept constant, whereas that of the working electrode was varied. For this experimental configuration DS0 is calculated from the rc slope of the E°0 versus temperature plot, whereas DH0 is obtained rc from the Gibbs­Helmholtz equation, namely, from the slope of the plot of E°0 /T versus 1/T [30]. All experiments were carried out under Argon over the 15­ 35 °C range using 1 mL samples containing 6 lM LPO and 4 lM EPO dissolved in 100 mM phosphate buffer and 100 mM NaCl at

tion of ferric LPO proceeds through the formation of a transient ferrous intermediate with band maxima at 444 nm (Soret band), 561 nm, and 593 nm, which was not stable but converted slowly within 45­60 min into a new stable Fe(II) form of LPO, characterized by absorption maxima at 434 nm (Soret band), 561 and 593 nm [31,32]. This process is due to an equilibrium between a protein form with a relatively open, unrestricted heme pocket, which transforms into a more constrained conformer [31­33]. This phenomenon is typical for LPO, and has been observed neither with MPO [31] nor with EPO (see below). Thus, to avoid any interference from the transient Fe(II) intermediate, in this work LPO was first fully reduced electrochemically, allowing its complete conversion into the stable ferrous form, which was then subjected to (oxidative) spectro-electrochemical titrations. Therefore, the E°0 values and the corresponding reduction thermodynamics refer to the redox equilibrium between the stable Fe(II) form of LPO and the ferric species. The Nernst plots obtained from the spectro-electrochemical titrations of LPO are linear (inset to Fig. 2A) with a slope close to the theoretical value of RT/F = 0.059 V at 25 °C, as expected for the one-electron Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox process [18­21,24,28,29,34­ 36]. The calculated standard reduction potential [E°0 (Fe(III)/Fe(II)] of bovine LPO of À176 ± 5 mV (25 °C and pH 7.0) is slightly higher than a previous literature value (À190 mV) [17], probably as a consequence of differences in the ionic composition of the protein solutions that were employed. Fig. 2B shows the electronic spectra of EPO measured at different applied potentials [32]. From the linear Nernst plot (inset to Fig. 2B) E°0 was determined to be À126 ± 5 mV, 50 mV higher than in LPO. This difference is rather unexpected and demonstrates that the similarity between the redox properties of the two peroxidases is less strict than was previously supposed [5,16]. The temperature profiles of the E°0 values for EPO and LPO are shown in Fig. 3, together with that of MPO [18]. In contrast to MPO, the reduction potentials of both LPO and EPO decrease with increasing temperature. The spectro-electrochemical response deteriorates above 35 °C due to protein denaturation and solvent evaporation. The obtained temperature profiles allowed factorization of the enthalpy (DH0 ) and entropy (DS0 ) rc rc changes during the reduction reaction, which are listed in Table 1 together with those of MPO [18] and non-animal (plant-type) heme peroxidases [19­21]. EPO and LPO feature different reduction thermodynamics. Reduction entropies are negative in both cases, but reduction enthalpy is positive for EPO and negative for LPO. Hence, in EPO Fe(III) reduction is enthalpically and entropically disfavored, whereas the negative E°0 value of LPO results from two opposing thermodynamic contributions: an enthalpic term which favors Fe(III) reduction and a larger entropic term that disfavors it.

defined peroxidase the same molecular factors influence the redox properties of the heme iron at different oxidation states. Additionally, it nicely reflects the capacity of these oxidoreductases to oxidize halides. Only MPO is able to oxidize chloride [E°0 (HOCl, ClÀ, H2O) = 1280 mV] at reasonable rates, and bromide oxidation [E°0 (HOBr, BrÀ, H2O) = 1130 mV] mediated by EPO compound I is faster than by LPO compound I [5,16].

Discussion Standard reduction potential of Fe(III)/Fe(II) of LPO and EPO The determined E° values for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple in LPO and EPO are listed in Table 1 along with those for MPO and (non-animal) heme peroxidases with unmodified heme b. The E°0 values for LPO and EPO were 181 mV and 131 mV lower than in MPO [18], unequivocally underlying the impact of the peculiar electron-withdrawing sulfonium ion bond and of the pronounced heme distortion on the redox chemistry of heme iron in myeloperoxidase. Interestingly, the hierarchy of E°0 [Fe(III)/Fe(II)], namely MPO > EPO > LPO, follows the same trend that was observed for E°0 of the compound I/Fe(III) couple, that is, MPO (1160 mV) > EPO (1100 mV) > LPO (1090 mV) [37,38].

Due to the lack of the three-dimensional structure of EPO, the observed differences between LPO and EPO cannot be related to distinct structural features. In both proteins, heme b is covalently bound by two ester bonds [10,11,39] resulting in similar spectral properties. Compared with (non-animal, plant-type) peroxidases with unmodified heme b, both LPO and EPO have more positive reduction potentials of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple (Table 1). This indicates that the two heme to protein ester bonds affect the redox chemistry of the heme iron, in agreement with theoretical calculations [15]. Apparently these effects are more pronounced in EPO than in LPO. The electron density at the heme iron in peroxidases is sensibly influenced by the imidazolate character of the proximal histidine, which depends on its H-bonding partner, that is a conserved aspartate and a asparagine in heme b (plant-type) peroxidases and in vertebrate peroxidases, respectively. In the former enzymes, it is generally assumed that the Asp­His­iron interaction at the proximal heme side mainly contributes to the (negative) E°0 by deprotonating the Nd position of the proximal histidine. This guarantees the stability of the ferric form that is competent in binding and reducing of hydrogen peroxide. In vertebrate peroxidases, the unprotonated Nd of the proximal histidine (anionic) is hydrogen bonded with the NH2-group of a fully conserved asparagine (Fig. 1D), whose carbonyl group interacts with the guanidinium group of a conserved arginine [9]. The pronounced imidazolate character of the proximal histidine is confirmed by resonance Raman studies in the low-frequency region [14], that demonstrated that the iron-imidazole stretching mode of both LPO and MPO is at fairly high frequencies. These data suggest that ­ independent of the nature of the H-bonding partner ­ in both heme peroxidase superfamilies the proximal histidine has a pronounced imidazolate character, that strengthens the iron-imidazole bond and exerts a comparable influence on the E°0 of the heme iron, stabilizing its higher oxidation states. Redox thermodynamics As discussed thoroughly elsewhere [40], reduction-induced changes in enthalpy and entropy contain contributions arising from both the reorganization of solvent molecules within the hydration sphere of the proteins and from protein-based factors. Thus the enthalpy (DH0 ) and entropy (DS0 ) changes accompanying Fe(III) to rc rc Fe(II) reduction in heme proteins are composed of intrinsic protein 0 0 contributions (DHrc; int and DSrc; int ) and solvent reorganisation factors (DH0 solv and DS0 solv ) [18­21,24,40] with DH0 ¼ DH0 int þ rc; rc rc; rc; DH0 solv and DS0 ¼ DS0 int þ DS0 solv . rc; rc rc; rc; 0 DHrc; int is mainly controlled by the donor properties of the axial heme ligands, the polarity of the protein environment and the electrostatic interactions between the redox center and polar and charged residues surrounding the heme, whereas DS0 int depends rc; on redox state-dependent differences in protein flexibility [18­ 21,24,40]. The available data for the ferric and ferrous forms of heme proteins indicate that, in general, reduction-induced 3D structural changes are quite small, allowing, as a first approximation, to attribute the measured DS0 to reduction-induced solvent rc reorganization effects only, that is, DS0 int % 0 [24,27]. This aprc; proach proved to work with plant-type peroxidases (HRP [20,21], ARP [20], KatG [19]), as well as with MPO [18]. In the latter case, in the absence of structural information concerning the ferrous enzyme, this hypothesis is based on the small local conformational changes observed upon substrate and/or ligand binding to the ferric protein [7,8]. Given the strict similarity between the structural effect of bromide, thiocyanate and cyanide binding in MPO and LPO [7,8,10,11], the above approach has been extended to the interpretation of the reduction thermodynamics of lactoperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase. Hence, it follows that, to a first approxima-

tion, for LPO and EPO DS0 ¼ DS0 solv = À73 JKÀ1 molÀ1 and rc rc; À18 JKÀ1 molÀ1, respectively. This compares with + 10 JKÀ1 molÀ1 for MPO [18]. Since reduction-induced solvent reorganization effects (e.g., changes in the H-bonding network involving the water molecules within the hydration sphere of the protein), have been found to induce compensatory enthalpy and entropy changes [40­43], the corresponding enthalpic contribution can be factorized out from the measured enthalpy change, finally allowing estimation of the protein-based contribution to DH0 : rc

Hence, to a first approximation, the measured E°0 coincides with DH0 int and would ultimately be determined by the selective enthalrc; pic stabilization of one of the two redox states by first coordination sphere and electrostatic effects. As a consequence DH0 int ¼ ÀnFE0 rc; corresponds to +17 kJ/mol (LPO), +12 kJ/mol (EPO) and 0 kJ/mol (MPO) (Table 1). Reduction enthalpy. Protein-based factors, such as metal­ligand binding interactions and the electrostatics at the interface between the heme, the protein environment and the solvent, selectively stabilize the ferric form of LPO and EPO much more efficiently than in MPO. In plant-type peroxidases the large enthalpic stabilization of the ferric heme (Table 1) has been attributed to the basic character of the proximal histidine and to the polarity of the distal heme cavity, which contains several water molecules involved in an extended network of hydrogen bonds [19­21]. Both sequence analysis [16] and comparison of the published X-ray structures [7­11] suggest that in mammalian peroxidases the heme cavity architecture is conserved. In fact, the anionic character of the proximal histidine, ensuing from its interaction with the adjacent asparagine [9], as well as the strength of the iron-imidazolate bond (Fig. 1) [31] seem to be a common feature in this family of peroxidases. Similarly, the interactions of the propionate sidechains on pyrrole rings C and D are conserved [7­11,16]. Also the catalytic amino acids His, Arg and Gln [16] in the distal heme side are strictly conserved (Fig. 1C and D) as is an extended H-bonding network formed by distinct water molecules (Fig. 1E and F), one of which is hydrogen bonded to the Ne of the distal histidine and lies about midway between the Ne of the latter residue and Fe(III). Based on these observations, it can be assumed that the contribution of these structural features to DDH0 int ¼ ½DH0 int ðMPOÞÀ rc; rc; DH0 int ðLPOÞ = À17 kJ/mol, and therefore to DE0 ¼ ½E0 ðMPOÞÀ rc; E0 ðLPOÞ = 181 mV is quite small. Thus, it seems that the lower enthalpic stabilization of ferric MPO and the resulting high E°0 [Fe(III)/Fe(II)] is mainly a consequence of the sulfonium linkage connecting the sulfur atom of Met243 with the b-carbon of the vinyl group on pyrrole ring A (Fig. 1A) [7,15,18]. In fact, the positive charge on the sulfur atom, which does not appear to be involved in any additional electrostatic interactions with the protein [7,8], would electrostatically stabilize the ferrous form of the heme. On the other hand, its electron-withdrawing effect reduces the basicity of the four pyrrole nitrogens, thereby decreasing the electron density at the heme iron and lowering the enthalpic stabilization of the ferric form of the enzyme due to ligand binding effects. The latter effect is enhanced by the pronounced distortions imposed on the porphyrin ring in MPO, which further reduces the contacts with the pyrrole nitrogens with the iron ion [7,8,31]. The lower protein-based enthalpic stabilization of the ferric form in EPO compared to LPO, DDH0 int ¼ ½DH0 int ðEPOÞÀ rc; rc; DH0 int ðLPOÞ = À5 kJ/mol and the corresponding DE°0 = E°0 rc; (EPO) À E°0 (LPO)] = 50 mV, is difficult to explain due to the absence of structural data [16]. Sequence [16] and mass spectrometric analysis [39] suggest a similar heme cavity architecture and heme to protein binding mode. On the other hand, differences in

the electronic UV­vis spectra of the ferrous and ferric form of both enzymes [32] as well in FT-IR data [31,44] might reflect some differences in the interaction of the heme iron with the proximal histidine and/or the distal water network. Reduction entropy. Since reduction entropy in LPO and EPO is, to a first approximation, mainly determined by reduction-induced solvent reorganization effects within the hydration sphere of the proteins, the observed differences in DS0 cannot be easily correrc lated with structural features of the proteins unless significant differences exist in protein­solvent interactions, especially at the heme moiety. Qualitatively, the negative DS0 values obtained for rc LPO and EPO indicate that reduction of Fe(III) increases the ordering of the solvent molecules in the solvation sphere of both proteins. MPO, on the contrary, features a small and positive reduction entropy [18] that has been ascribed to a rigid hydrogen bond network involving conserved water molecules in the surrounding of the heme, which would support the binding of its small anionic substrate and help to transfer and incorporate the oxyferryl oxygen to fixed ClÀ thereby forming hypochlorous acid [16,18]. Comparison of the 3D-structures of the iodide and bromide complexes of LPO and MPO [8,11] suggests that the overall rigidity of the hydrogen bond network involving the water molecules in the surrounding of the heme is a common feature of mammalian peroxidases and not limited to MPO. Therefore, the origin of the difference of the DS0 values between LPO and MPO (and EPO) must rc be searched outside the heme cavity. In MPO the substrate channel is considerably shallow and has a funnel-like shape [7], whereas in LPO the cylindrical access channel is narrower, longer and more hydrophobic [10,11]. By contrast, the substrate channels of EPO and MPO feature an 80% sequence homology [16], suggesting a similar channel architecture in both proteins. Therefore, it appears that the heme distal site in LPO is less accessible and less solvent exposed than in MPO and EPO. These differences are mirrored by the DS0 values reported in Table 1. In MPO and EPO Fe(III) reducrc tion is associated with small entropy changes (although of different sign), whereas in LPO reduction entropy is larger and negative. These observations reflect a general feature in metalloprotein chemistry, namely that the reduction entropy turns from positive to negative values with decreasing the solvent accessibility of the metal center [19­21,24­28,30].
