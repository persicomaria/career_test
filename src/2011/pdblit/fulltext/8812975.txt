Properties of a New Crystal Form of the Complex of Concanavalin A with Methyl a-D-Glucopyranoside
The complex of concanavalin A with methyl rhombic dodecahedra containing 35% protein with a = 167.8 a (1 A = 0.1 nm) and contains unit. It diffracts to a resolution of 1.9 A and is the structure of the saccharide-binding site. a-n-glucopyranoside crystallizes as regular by weight. The crystal is of space group 123 one concanavalin A dimer per asymmetric suitable for crystallographic investigation of

The saccharide-binding protein, concanavalin A, has been studied extensively by X-ray crystallographic analysis of an orthorhombic crystal of space-group 1222 (Greer et al., 1970; Weinzierl & Kalb, 1971; Hardman & Ainsworth, 1972; Edelman et al., 1972; Hardman et al., 1982; Yariv et al., 1985). Attempts to determine the structure of the saccharide-binding site of concanavalin A by soaking this crystal in aqueous solutions of methyl a-D-glucopyranoside or methyl a-D-mannopyranoside fail because of the high solubility of these concanavalin A-glycoside complexes. Co-crystallization of concanavalin A with methyl a-Dmannopyranoside has produced crystals of space group C222, (Hardman & Ainsworth, 1976; Becker et al.. 1976) but has not yielded the structure of the complex. In t,his crystal form, glycosides of D-glUCose and n-mannose were found to be freely exchangeable. In the new crystal form, which we describe here, this is not the case. The crystal is formed only in the presence of methyl a-Dglucopyranoside and dissolves in the presence of methyl a-n-mannopyranoside. This suggests that these two glycosides, which bind competitively to the saccharide-binding site of concanavalin A, stabilize or induce different conformations of the protein. Crystals of the complex were grown by dialysis. Portions (0.2 ml) of protein solution were equilibrated with 20 ml of 1.8 M-sodium phosphate and 0.1 M-methyl a-D-glucopyranoside. No crystals formed when the mannoside replaced the glucoside in the dialysis solution. Regular rhombic dodecahedra formed in a few days within a limited range of conditions: a ratio of NaH,PO, to Na,HPO, from 2 to 0.5 and a protein concentration from 100 to 150 mg/ml. Routinely, an equimolar mixture of the two phosphates and a protein concentration of 120 mg/ml were used. The crystals were stable at glucoside concentrations above 1 mM. They dissolved at lower concentrations of this saccharide or in 0.1 M-methyl a-n-mannopyranoside. Crystals were handled in a synthetic mother liquor of the following composition: 1.8 M-sodium

Diffraction patterns for determination of the space group and the unit cell dimensions were recorded with a precession camera (Ni-filtered CuKa Buerger crystal-to-film distance 75 mm). The radiation, space group was assigned on the basis of symmetries and systematic absences observed on 9" screened precession photographs of the principal zones and 2" unscreened precession photographs down the major axes. Unit cell dimensions were measured from the 9" photographs of hk0, h01 and Ok1 and are given in Table 1. Crystals were equilibrated with synthetic mother liquor for one hour before determination of crystal density and weight. Crystals from a single pool were used for these measurements. Crystal density was determined by flotation in mixtures of watersaturated xylenes and carbon tetrachloride. For determination of crystal weight and protein content, five individual crystals, drained of extraneous liquid with filter paper, were weighed on an electronic Mettler microbalance sensitive to the fourth decimal place. After weighing, ea,ch crystal was dissolved in 0.5 ml of distilled water for determination of it#s protein content from its ultraviolet light absorbance. The ult,raviolet spectrum was measured on a portlion of the dissolved crystal diluted with a standard buffer solut,ion (0.05 M-sodium acetat,e, 0.2 M-NaCl, pH 5.2) and the protein concentration was calcuTable 1 of the cubic crystal

lated on the basis of Ai& = 12.4 (Yariv et al., 1968). The molecular weight of the asymmetric unit was calculated by means of a formula suggested by Matthews (1974): Mp = N Vm,,,D&, where M, is the molecular weight of protein in the asymmetric unit, V and nP are the unit cell volume and the number of asymmetric units per unit cell, D, is the crystal density, m, is the mass of protein per unit mass of crystal and N is Avogadro's number. In space group 123 (or Z2,3) the unit cell contains 24 identical units (International Tables for X-Ray Crystallography, 1965). The protein mass that we find in the asymmetric unit in the cubic crystal of the concanavalin A-saccharide complex is 50,300 daltons. This figure agrees well with the minimal molecular weight of concanavalin A in solution, found to be 55,000 by the method of sedimentation equilibrium (Kalb & Lustig, 1968), and with the molecular weight of the concanavalin A dimer, calculated to be 51,260 from the amino acid sequence (Cunningham et al., 1975). The high accuracy and precision of our results as well as the simplicity of the experimental operations and straightforwardness of the computations recommend this hitherto untested method of direct weighing of crystals for widespread application in protein crystallography. It should be pointed out that an earlier determination of the molecular weight of concanavalin A from the density of an orthorhombic, saccharide-free crystal gave 26,000 daltons as the mass of protein in the asymmetric unit and proved conclusively that the species of minimal molecular weight in solution was a dimer (Greer et al., 1970). In the aforementioned, orthorhombic crystal of saccharide-free concanavalin A, the crystal volume per unit of protein molecular weight, V,, is 2.35 A3/dalton (Greer et al., 1970), very nearly the average value for over 100 crystalline proteins (Matthews, 1968). In the cubic crystal of the saccharide complex, however, the extremely large value of V,, 3.91 A3/dalton, attests to a major alteration in the packing scheme (1 A = 0.1 nm). Resolution tests performed with a sealed tube (CuKu) and with the synchrotron radiation source (SRS) at Daresbury show that the crystals diffract to 1.9 A resolution. The stability of the crystals in the synchrotron beam is good and full data sets
have been collected from this crystal and its derivatives. We are applying molecular replacement and isomorphous replacement methods for solution of this structure. Edited
