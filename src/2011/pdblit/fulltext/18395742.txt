The 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase (KGPDC) catalyses the decarboxylation of 3-ketoL-gulonate 6-phosphate to L-xylulose in the presence of magnesium ions. The enzyme is involved in L-ascorbate metabolism and plays an essential role in the pathway of glucuronate interconversion. Crystal structures of Streptococcus mutans KGPDC were determined in the absence and presence of the product analog D-ribulose 5-phosphate. We have observed an 8 ≈ aB-helix movement and other structural rearrangements around the active site between the apo-structures and product analog bound structure. These drastic conformational changes upon ligand binding are the first observation of this kind for the KGPDC family. The flexibilities of both the a-helix lid and the side chains of Arg144 and Arg197 are associated with substrate binding and product releasing. The open≠closed conformational changes of the active site, through the movements of the a-helix lid and the arginine residues are important for substrate binding and catalysis. ” 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction The 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase (KGPDC, EC 4.1.1.85) was first identified in mammals and the yeast Schwanniomyces occidentalis for myo-inositol catabolism [1,2], and further confirmed to be an essential downstream enzyme in the L-ascorbate metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli [3≠5]. The KGPDC is responsible for the Mg2+ dependent decarboxylation from 3-ketoL-gulonate 6-phosphate to yield L-xylulose 5-phosphate. KGPDC is classified into the orotidine 50 -monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC) suprafamily [6]. This suprafamily of enzymes, which mainly contains OMPDC, KGPDC and hexulose phosphate synthase (HPS), shares the common triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel fold [7≠9]. They have the same conserved active-site architecture for their different chemical reactions: an Asp at the b1-strand, a His at the end of the b6-strand, an Arg at the beginning of the b7-strand, and a conserved Asp-X-Lys-X-X-Asp motif at the end of the b3-strand (Fig. 1). KGPDC decarboxylation mechanism including an elaboration on protonation states has been published for the E. coli enzyme (ecKGPDC) [10]. It is established that the His136 transfers a proton directly or via a water molecule as a pro-

ton shuttle to the Mg2+-stabilized enediolate, generating the product, and that Arg139 is able to function as the proton source as well [10≠12]. Streptococcus mutans is regarded as a major contributor to tooth decay and periodontal disease [13,14]. The KGPDC from S. mutans (smKGPDC) was initially defined as a putative HPS based on sequence homology. Recent studies indicated that ecKGPDC can function as HPS as well, although with low efficiency [15,16]. In this work, the crystal structures of the smKGPDC apo-enzyme and its complex with a product analog, D-ribulose 5-phosphate (DR5P), are reported. These structures have revealed previously unobserved conformational flexibility around the active site for substrate/product binding. Especially the aB-helix (residues 144≠ 149) and the side chains of the conserved Arg144 and Arg197 (Arg136 and Arg192 in ecKGPDC) exhibited open≠closed conformational changes between the apo-structure and complex structure with ligand bound at the active site. These results, which have not been described before in the KGPDC family, provided us with new insight for further understanding of the KGPDC catalytic mechanism. Materials and methods

inserted into the BamHI/XhoI-digested expression vector pET-28a containing an N-terminal His6-tag. The constructed plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells for expression. Transformed cells were cultured in Luria≠Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 lg ml¿1 kanamycin at 310 K. When the OD600 reached 0.6≠0.8, isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce protein expression for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5430g for 9 min (Beckman, Rotor ID JA10), and resuspended in the binding buffer (20 mM Tris≠HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Protein purification and crystallization. The resuspended cells were lysed by sonication on ice and then centrifuged at 55,914g for 60 min at 277 K. The supernatant was filtered by a 0.22 lM filterloaded onto a 5 ml Ni2+-chelating affinity column (HiTrap, GE Healthcare, USA) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. The target protein was eluted with 350 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris≠HCl and 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The fractions were further purified using a 16/60 Hiload Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer

containing 20 mM Tris≠HCl, and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 for equilibration and elution. The results were assessed by SDS≠PAGE. Target protein was then concentrated to 30 mg ml¿1 estimated by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, USA). Crystallization screening was carried out at 289 K using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion technique. One microliter protein solution was mixed with 1 ll reservoir solution and equilibrated against 500 ll reservoir solution. The best crystals were obtained in the condition containing 0.2 M KCl, 0.05 M HEPES pH 7.5, and 35% v/v pentaerythritol propoxylate. The complex with D-R5P was prepared by soaking the apo-enzyme crystals in mother liquor containing 5 mM D-R5P for 10 min at 289 K. Data collection, structure determination, and refinement. Diffraction data of the apo-enzyme were collected at MAX-Lab, Lund, Sweden. The data were processed using the programs XDS and XSCALE [17]. Two data sets from crystals belonging to two different space groups were collected: one tetragonal crystal with space group I422 diffracted to 2.0 ≈, containing one molecule per asym-

metric unit (cell parameters: a = b = 83.78 ≈, c = 171.62 ≈); and the other orthorhombic crystal with space group P212121 diffracted to 1.7 ≈, containing four molecules per asymmetric unit (cell parameters: a = 60.00 ≈, b = 127.60 ≈, and c = 131.00 ≈). The diffraction data of the complex with D-R5P were collected on a Bruker SMART 6000 CCD detector using Cu Ka radiation of a Bruker MicroSTAR H rotating-anode generator. The data were processed using the Bruker online software PROTEUM. The crystal of the D-R5P complex belonged to the space group P212121, with unit cell parameters a = 59.15 ≈, b = 124.25 ≈, c = 130.07 ≈ and diffracted to 2.5 ≈. All data collection statistics were summarized in Table 1. The structure of the apo-smKGPDC was solved by molecular replacement method using the program MOLREP [18], taking the structure of ecKGPDC as the search model (PDB code 1KV8) [19]. Automated model building was performed with the program ARP/wARP [20]. The smKGPDC apo-structure was used as the starting model to solve and refine the structure of the complex with D-R5P. All structures were refined with the programs COOT [21] and REFMAC [22]. The qualities of the final models were checked with the program PROCHECK [23]. The final refinement statistics were listed in Table 1. The program PyMOL (http://www.pymol. sourceforge.net/) was used to prepare structural figures. Results and discussion Overall structure of apo-smKGPDC The models of the apo-enzyme obtained in two different space groups are almost identical with an averaged root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.24 ≈ for all aligned Ca atoms. The smKGPDC is a homo-dimer from gel filtration results (data not shown). Analysis of the two different apo-smKGPDC crystal forms confirms that dimerization occurs through a significant and conserved interface with averaged interaction areas about 1078 and 1084 ≈2 in orthorhombic and tetragonal forms, respectively, as calculated with the

PISA program [24]. The two active sites of the dimeric enzyme are located at the interface area (Fig. 1A). The monomeric structure of smKGPDC folds into a TIM-barrel containing three extra small ahelices (aA, residues 38≠44; aB, residues 144≠149; and aC, residues 197≠201; see Fig. 1) besides the typical (a/b)8 topology. According to the electron density maps, residues from 145 to 150, mainly forming the aB-helix, are only observed in the chains A and D of the orthorhombic apo-structure. This aB-helix displays considerable conformational flexibility; thus we call it the ``aB-helix lid" due to its open and closed movement towards the active site upon ligand binding (Fig. 2B and C). Complex with D-ribulose 5-phosphate To address the unresolved issues about the reaction mechanism, native smKGPDC crystals of the orthorhombic crystal form were soaked in crystallization buffer containing the product analog D-R5P. The structure of smKGPDC/D-R5P complex includes four molecules per asymmetric unit. Only chain D contained continuous electron density for almost all residues, from Gln4 to Gly221. The other three molecules displayed gaps in the electron density maps, particularly in the aB-helix region similar to what was described for the apo-enzyme structure. The D-R5P molecules were found in each active site of chains B and D. The ligand D-R5P in the chain D was well resolved in the complex structure except for the oxygen atom on C1 (Fig. 2A), the missing C1 hydroxyl group is a general feature for the ecKGPDC complex structures as well [16]. The ligand interactions mainly involve residues within one monomer. The oxygen atom on C2 interacts with Lys66 to stabilize the conformation of the substrate. The oxygen atom on C3 forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of Asp13. The phosphate group of D-R5P forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg197, and the backbone of Gly176 and Gly196. Additionally, the active site substitution of Tyr119 in smKGPDC to Thr114 in ecKGPDC still makes a hydrogen bond to

Color codes are indicated on the figure. The aB-helices from the complex structures with ligands bound are in the same locations close to the active sites relative to the apo-structures. The movement of the aB-helix lid from the open state to the closed state is about 8 ≈.

the conserved His141. The hydrogen bonding interactions between side chains of His141 and Glu117 may function to orient the imidazole ring, and His141 initiate the substrate protonation, similar to the function of H136 in ecKGPDC [10]. Open≠closed conformational changes After binding D-R5P, the small aB-helix and the side chains of Arg144 and Arg197 at the active site underwent remarkable structural changes relative to the apo-structure (Fig. 2C). In the structure of the apo-enzyme, the aB-helix was located away from the active site, and the side chains of Arg144 and Arg197 were in conformations that allow substrate to be accommodated at the active site, i.e. in an open state. In the D-R5P bound form, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between the phosphate moiety and the guanidinium group of Arg197 made the arginine side chain

turn towards the active site, and the conserved Gly176 and Gly196 residues underwent slight adjustments to allow contact with the phosphate group. Arg144 also moved considerably, so that the residue can be positioned at the entrance of the ligand binding pocket by stacking interaction with Arg197. This movement disrupted the salt bridge between Arg144 and Asp69 (from a neighboring molecule) at the dimer interface and increased the interface area slightly from 1078 ≈2 (of apo-model) to 1196 ≈2 (of complex model). The aB-helix lid repositioned and moved towards the catalytic cavity, narrowing the pocket entrance (Fig. 2B and C). The rearrangements of the aB-helix lid and side chains of the two arginines closed the pocket entrance substantially to protect the substrate at the active site from bulk solvent. In addition, comparing the apo and complex models of the chain D, the rmsd value was about 1.6 ≈ for all Ca atoms compared, whereas the rmsd values of the

other corresponding molecule pairs were around 0.3≠0.6 ≈ for all aligned Ca atoms indicating the D-R5P binding indeed caused large conformational changes. Upon D-R5P binding, this a-helix lid moved about 8 ≈ closer towards the active site. In the apo-structure of the orthorhombic form, except for the C-terminus, the aB and the a5-helices had the highest B-factors of the whole structure in all monomers (Fig. 2D). Actually, the a5-helix (residues 179≠185) also underwent a movement of 2 ≈ towards the active site upon D-R5P binding, consistent with the higher B-factors around the Asp180 (Fig. 2B). These flexible segments contributed to switch the active site from open state to closed state upon ligand binding. According to the reported kinetic parameters of ecKGPDC, the Arg139Ala mutant (Arg144 in S. mutans) is responsible for the decreased kcat value (51 versus 8.9 s¿1) and a lower kcat/Km relative to the wild type enzyme (7.7 ¬ 104 versus 2.5 ¬ 104 M¿1 s¿1) [12]. It indicates that the residue is involved in the catalysis and proton transfer in the KGPDC reaction [10,12]. The role of this arginine for catalysis can be re-evaluated in the light of our structural information. Arg144 does not interact with the substrate directly, but the movements of this residue and the aB-helix lid induce the closed state of the active site, representing the major role of Arg144 during catalysis. Both roles of Arg144 are consistent with the mutational and kinetic data of the ecKGPDC enzyme, representing a possible general feature of the KGPDC protein family. Structure comparisons Several published structures of ecKGPDC with different ligands now are available [10≠12,16,19]. The smKGPDC is similar to the ecKGPDC with 47% sequence identity. The structure of smKGPDC/ D-R5P is consistent with the complex structures of ecKGPDC with ligand bound. The average rmsd value of smKGPDC/D-R5P and the ecKGPDC complex structures (PDB code 1XBV, 1Q6L, 1Q6Q, and 1Q6R) is 0.7 ≈ for all aligned Ca atoms. All the active site residues, with the exception of Tyr119 substitution, are well conserved (Fig. 2C). It has also been noted that the dimer interface is remarkably similar in all KGPDC structures, indicating the open≠closed conformational changes described above are not involved the dimer interface for KGPDC family of enzymes. The open≠closed conformational switch caused by the flexibility of the aB-helix lid and arginine side chains has not been reported before due to the lack of a ligand-free ecKGPDC structure. These flexible segments are also fixed in the phosphate bound ecKGPDC structure (PDB code 1KV8), showing a closed state of the enzyme active site. As discussed above, the conformational changes observed at the active site on substrate binding must contribute to the catalytic reaction of KGPDC. We anticipate that these different conformational states observed in this work have provided us with some detailed snapshots of intermediate steps involved in the catalytic cycle of KGPDC family of enzymes in general. It is most likely that the observed open state of our apo-structures corresponds to a conformation primed for substrate binding. Future studies about kinetic characterization of certain mutants and substrate analogs will extend our mechanistic knowledge on the KGPDC family of enzymes and bring further insights on the significance of the suggested residues involved in the conformational changes.
