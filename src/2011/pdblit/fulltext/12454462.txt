Previous studies have demonstrated that in vitro crystallization of R-state liganded hemoglobin C (HbC), a naturally occurring mutant human hemoglobin (E6K), in highphosphate buffer solutions provides a potential model system for the intracellular crystallization of HbC associated with chronic hemolytic anemia in CC disease. The ®rst highresolution crystal structure of liganded HbC is reported here. HbC was crystallized from high phosphate and the structure of Ê the carbonmonoxy-liganded R-state form was re®ned at 2.0 A resolution. Crystals exhibit diffraction consistent with the tetragonal space group P41212, with unit-cell parameters a = Ê 54.16, c = 195.30 A. The structure was solved by difference Fourier techniques and re®nement by simulated annealing and restrained least-squares yielded a ®nal R of 0.183 and an Rfree of 0.238 for all 19 382 unique re¯ections. The side chain of K6 exhibits very weak electron density consistent with signi®cant mobility within the crystalline lattice. The highly dynamic nature of the side chain could potentially support a number of speci®c polar interactions that might reduce the barrier to crystallization and thus result in enhanced crystallization kinetics for HbC relative to HbA. Speci®cally, the NZ atom of the BK6 side chain could participate in an amino± aromatic hydrogen bond with the %-electron cloud of H116 in a symmetry-related tetramer. K6 NZ might also interact with the main-chain carbonyl O atom of H117 and the carboxylate group of E22 from a symmetry-related tetramer.

1. Introduction
The aggregating 6 mutant human hemoglobins HbC1 (E6K) and HbS (E6V) both give rise to signi®cant pathobiology; however, the mechanistic consequences of the single aminoacid substitutions are dramatically different. Unliganded T-state deoxyHbS forms polymers (Eaton & Hofrichter, 1990; Harrington et al., 1997) within the red blood cells of SS patients (homozygous for HbS), initiating a cascade of pathophysiological events that frequently leads to severe morbidity and mortality in the form of sickle-cell anemia. In contrast, oxy HbC forms intra-erythrocytic crystals. Patients with CC genotype (homozygous for HbC) and SC genotype (heterozygous for HbS and HbC) can exhibit circulating red blood cells containing hemoglobin crystals (Charache et al., 1967; Diggs et al., 1954; Kraus & Diggs, 1956) in the oxygenated liganded state (Hirsch et al., 1985; Lawrence et al., 1991), particularly when splenectomized. Typically, within these cells

the entire hemoglobin is sequestered into a single crystal, which is surrounded by the plasma membrane. CC patients exhibit a chronic mild hemolytic anemia with little morbidity, in contrast to SC patients that exhibit moderate morbidity and reduced life span [but less than that of SS (sickle cell) patients]. The pathology of SC disease is not a consequence of intra-erythrocytic HbC crystal formation, but rather is associated with formation of the deoxyHbS polymers observed in SC erythrocytes (Nagel & Lawrence, 1991; Lawrence et al., 1991). For a review of HbC disorders, see Nagel & Steinberg (2001). Various red-cell components in¯uence the nucleation kinetics of HbC (Hirsch et al., 1988, 1998; Hirsch, Witkowska et al., 1997; Hirsch, Rybicki et al., 1997; Lin et al., 1989; Nagel et al., 1993) and liganded HbS accelerates HbC nucleation and is incorporated into the liganded HbC crystal (Lin et al., 1988; Patskovska et al., 2000). If HbS could be speci®cally driven into the HbC crystal, this may have therapeutic signi®cance in reducing the availability of HbS to form polymers in red blood cells of SC patients, since the delay time of HbS aggregation is markedly affected by small changes in hemoglobin concentration or solubility (for a review of HbS delay time, see Eaton & Hofrichter, 1990). More recently, we have observed that little or no pathology arises in compound heterozygous patients of HbC, including SC compound heterozygotes, that also express hemoglobins shown to increase the nucleation kinetics of liganded HbC crystallization (Nagel et al., 1993; Lawrence et al., 1997). These studies have also served in the identi®cation of some residues involved in the intermolecular contacts of the crystal (Hirsch et al., 1988, 1998; Hirsch, Witkowska et al., 1997; Hirsch, Rybicki et al., 1997; Lin et al., 1989). These contact sites are of signi®cance in the design of therapeutic means to alter rates of nucleation. Until now, there has been no report of a high-resolution HbC structure (Fitzgerald & Love, 1979). We present here the Ê R-state HbC molecular structure at 2 A obtained from crystals grown in concentrated potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 1.75 M). This structure has multifold clinical signi®cance that will help further the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the aforementioned hemoglobinopathies and in the recently reported protective effect of the CC genotype against life-threatening human malaria induced by Plasmodium falciparum (Modiano et al., 2001).

HbC(O2) were converted to HbC(CO) by exposure to CO gas without bubbling. Complete conversion and the absence of metHbC were con®rmed by the examination of visible spectra at 500±700 nm. HbC(CO) was chosen for study rather than HbC(O2) because (i) hemoglobin is more stable in the CO form, being less prone to oxidation (Baldwin, 1980; Shaanan, 1983), (ii) only minor differences exist between the crystal structures of R-state HbA(CO) and HbA(O2) (Shaanan, 1983) and (iii) crystal morphology and nucleation kinetics are essentially identical for HbC(CO) and HbC(O2) (Hirsch et al., 1988). Crystals were grown at ambient temperature by a modi®cation of the batch method (Hirsch et al., 1988) using HbC(CO) at a ®nal concentration of 20 mg mlÀ1 and a range of potassium phosphate concentrations (1.5±1.8 M, pH 7.35). Mixtures were exposed to CO gas, without bubbling, 3±4 times per week. Large crystals ($1 mm) grew within 3±10 d from a batch having a phosphate concentration of 1.75 M. Diffraction from these crystals is consistent with the tetragonal space Ê group P41212, with unit-cell parameters a = 54.16, c = 195.30 A. The asymmetric unit consists of one  dimer, giving four ()2 hemoglobin tetramers per unit cell. The dimer in the asymmetric unit is designated 11, while the 22 dimer generated by the crystallographic symmetry operation (Ày + 1, Àx + 1, 1 À z) completes the tetramer. 2

re®nement. The CO ligands were excluded from the initial model and the mutant K6 residue was included as Ala. Ê Several rounds of re®nement using data in the 22.5±2.0 A resolution range and consisting of simulated-annealing, positional and individual isotropic B-factor re®nements were È performed with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1996). A test set of re¯ections, consisting of 9.8% of the data, was used throughout the re®nement for the determination of Rfree È (Brunger, 1992a,b). Each round of re®nement was followed by manual rebuilding of the model with TOM (Jones, 1985; Jones & Thornton, 1996). Side chains of disordered residues were replaced by Ala and ®t into 2Fo À Fc difference Fourier maps, followed by further re®nement. Water molecules were located in 2Fo À Fc maps as peaks with electron density greater than 1.0' that were within 2.5± Ê 3.5 A of a hydrogen-bond donor or acceptor, gave acceptable hydrogen-bond geometry and did not appear to be part of a disordered side chain. At later stages in the re®nement, only positional and B-factor re®nements were performed. In all but the ®nal cycle of re®nement, water molecules were deleted Ê from the model if their B factor exceeded 90 A2. The CO ligands were also included at this stage and an isotropic bulkÈ solvent correction was applied (Jiang & Brunger, 1994). The side chain of K6 was only represented by weak electron density and could only be modeled into continuous density at the 0.5' level in a 2Fo À Fc map, which exhibited considerable noise. Thus, this residue must be considered highly dynamic. The ®nal model consists of 2192 non-H protein atoms from the 141-residue -chain, the 146-residue -chain, the 90 atoms of two CO-liganded heme groups and 113 water molecules, with R and Rfree of 0.183 and 0.238, respectively. The average Ê B factor for all protein atoms is 24.9 A2, while the average B Ê factor for water molecules is 51.3 A2. The model displays excellent stereochemistry, with r.m.s.d. bond lengths and Ê angles of 0.007 A and 1.12 , respectively. No residues were modeled with alternative side-chain conformations and all occupied allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The programs PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and WHAT_CHECK (Vriend & Sander, 1993) were used to verify the stereochemical quality of the ®nal model. The quality of the electron-density map (e.g. at the heme site) is illustrated (Fig. 2). structures with which HbC(CO) are best compared are 1aj9 and 1hho. The 1aj9 structure determination was undertaken to update the 2hco PDB entry, but re®nement revealed that the determination had actually been performed on the naturally occurring human A53S mutant. This mutation on the surface

3. Results and discussion
3.1. HbC(CO) adopts the R-state quaternary structure

The present structure of HbC(CO) clearly demonstrates that it adopts the R state and demonstrates that minor differences in pH and phosphate concentration appear to have little effect on the hemoglobin molecule, as all R-state hemoglobin structures are very similar. The

of the tetramer reportedly causes no observable perturbation Â to the molecule (Vasquez et al., 1998). The signi®cant similarity amongst the HbC(CO), 1aj9 and 1hho structures is evident from a superposition of equivalent C atoms carried out using ProFit (Martin, 1995). The r.m.s.d. Ê between the -chains of HbC(CO) and 1aj9 is 0.28 A, between Ê and between 1aj9 and 1hho is HbC(CO) and 1hho is 0.30 A Ê Ê 0.38 A. For the -chains these values are 0.31, 0.38 and 0.42 A, respectively, and for the complete  dimer the values are Ê 0.30, 0.36 and 0.41 A, respectively. Difference distance matrix plots produced with DDMP (Center for Structural Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA) further highlight the structural similarity between these structures. When the and -chains are considered independently, they reveal that Ê the majority of differences, none of which exceeds 1.9 A, involve residues 1, 141 and 146 at the N- and C-termini. This is also the case when the  dimers are considered as a unit. Terminal residues of all R-state structures suffer disorder (Perutz, 1970, 1976, 1990; Baldwin & Chothia, 1979; Baldwin, 1980; Shaanan, 1983) and the observed structural differences are likely to re¯ect the dif®culty and subjectivity in placing them in the weak electron density. This disorder may be relevant as the rupture of the intersubunit hydrogen bonds at the - and -chain C-termini upon undergoing the T±R transition is central to the Perutz (1970, 1976, 1990) mechanism of hemoglobin cooperativity. The largest C differences, other than those involving chain Ê termini, occur at residue A76, with a 1.53 A C-atom difference being observed between HbC(CO) and 1hho and a Ê 1.42 A difference between 1aj9 and 1hho. The deviations arise from a conformational difference in the G74±H77 turn of the EF loop region in 1hho when compared with the same region in HbC(CO) and 1aj9 and has been noted previously by Â Vasquez et al. (1998). The C difference between HbC(CO) Ê and 1aj9 at A76 is 0.40 A. The small r.m.s.d. values for the superposition of equivalent C positions of HbC(CO), 1aj9 and 1hho and the similarity of the C difference distance matrices attest to the lack of perturbation by surface alterations in these structures.
3.3. The bE6K mutation site

The increased propensity of R-state HbC to crystallize more readily in vitro is presumably the consequence of unique intertetrameric interactions that are not available to HbA. Replicas of freeze-etched intra-erythrocytic crystals revealed subunit Ê particles measuring about 65 Â 100 A arrayed in a non-cubic monoclinic pattern resembling either a tetragonal or hexagonal arrangement, depending on the region of the crystal viewed (Lessin et al., 1969). Atomic force microscopy has demonstrated that this array appears similar to that observed in R-state (CO) HbC crystals grown under the same conditions used for the present structure determination (FeelingTaylor, 2002; Vekilov et al., 2003). The K6 mutation site resides in the A helix on the surface of the -chain. In these crystals, the side chain of this residue appears to be highly mobile, as evidenced by very weak electron density. Modeling suggests that K6 4-amino group (NZ) could participate in several potential interactions, including an amino±aromatic interaction with the %-electron cloud of the imidazole ring of H116 in a symmetry-related tetramer. A similar interaction was observed in hen ovotransferrin involving Lys and Tyr residues (Dewan et al., Â 1993) and Vasquez et al. (1998) suggested similar interactions in 1aj9 involving two His residues. Additional interactions available to the K6 side chain on the basis of distance considerations are potential hydrogen bonds between K6 NZ and H117 O and between the positively charged K6 NZ and the negatively charged carboxylate group of E22. Another possible interaction is that involving K6 NZ and the %-electron cloud of H117. The absence of highly populated polar interactions involving K6 NZ may be the consequence of the very high ionic strength used for crystallization. Alternatively, some subset of these polar interactions, in particular the potential salt bridge between K6 NZ and E22, may only form transiently during the transition state for nucleation and do not contribute to the ground-state stability of the crystalline lattice.

4. Conclusion
3.2. Phosphate-binding sites

No phosphate anions have been assigned in HbC(CO). In 1hho there is a single phosphate positioned on a crystallographic twofold axis and the same site is observed in the V96W mutant (PDB code 1rvw; Puius et al., 1998). The site lies in the central cavity of the tetramer, close to the DPGbinding site of the T-state structure (Arnone, 1972; Richard et al., 1993) and differs from the phosphate-binding site assigned in the asymmetric unit of 1aj9 at the 12 interface. In HbC(CO), there are no water molecules at the position equivalent to the 1hho phosphate-binding site, although a Ê single water molecule is located 0.7 A from the site observed Ê in 1aj9. However, as its re®ned B factor of 54.3 A2 is close to Ê 2 observed for all HbC(CO) water the average of 51.3 A molecules, it is unlikely to represent a phosphate site.
Acta Cryst. (2002). D58, 2038±2042

The present structure (PDB code 1k1k) demonstrates that HbC(CO) crystals grown from high concentrations of phosphate, exhibit the R-state quaternary conformation similar to HbA(oxy) (PDB code 1hho). The HbC(CO) structure also highlights the extensive mobility of K6 and suggests potential ionic interactions that are responsible for driving the intraerythrocytic crystal formation associated with CC and SC diseases in humans.
