Summary - - The refined structures of the cytochrome c3 molecules from Desuifovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki and Hildenborough have been compared in detail. Though there are no significant differences of the overall structure and spatial arrangement of four heme groups between two molecules, there are some umque features with regard to the local structures near the heme pockets. Two of the heme groups show significant differences including a hydrogen bonding scheme between the imidazole rings and water molecules in heme pocket. The water molecule near the heme 1 pocket in Miyazaki cytochrome Ca is replaced by the C51 atom of Leu9 in the Hildenborough s~ructure. The rotation around the Cot--C[i bond of Leu9 results in the increase of the solvent accessibility of the portion of the heme 1 edge. On the other hand, in heme3 one water molecule is additionally included in the hydrogen bonding network with a NSI atom of the imidazole ring and carbonyl oxygen atom of the main chain in Hildenborough cytochrome c3. This additional hydrogen bonding network will cc.-ntribute to the possible passage between the imidazole ring and the molecular surface. These features have been related to the upfield shift of the C2 proton si.gnais of NMR spectra and the low redox potentials of the cytochrome ca molecules of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough in comparison with those from Miyazaki.

Introduction
C y t o c h r o m e c3 has been considered to be a marker protein in the genus Desulfovibrio o f sulfate-reducing bacteria. In vivo it is the electron c a g i e r o f the nonheine iron protein, hydrogenase. C y t o c h r o m e c3 is a tetra-heme protein with a relatively small molecular mass of about 14 kDa. At least four structures o f cytochrome c~ molecules from different species, Nor.~-ay (DdN) [!], M i y a z a k i F ( D v M ) [2], Hildenborough ( D v H ) [3, 41 and Gigas [5] in Desuifovibrio have been elucidated by X - r a y diffraction m e t h o d so far. A m o n g them, the coordinates o f cytochromes c3 from D v H [3], D v M [2] and D d N [ 1] are currently available from the Protein Data B a n k [6]. The cytochromes c3 from D v H and D v M have a 88% sequence h o m o l o g y (fig 1), and both structures were applied to crystallographic refinement at high resolution. The redox properties were intensively studied by N M R [7], R a m a n spectroscopy [8], and voltammetric m e t h o d [9], and were found to be similar to each other but for the details. The differences o f the two cytochromes c3 were

thought to be due to the small difference between the structures near the heine groups. Here we report the important differences o f the structures between cytochromes c3 from D v H and D v M and discuss their relationship with the redox properties.

Materials and m e t h o d s
The atomic coordinates of the cytochromes c3 from DvH and DvM used were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. The structure from DvM was refined to the crystallographic R factor of 0.176 for 9907 reflections at 1.8 A resolution, whereas that from DvH was refined at 2.0 A to final R = 0.212 for 6233 reflections. Since both structures were refined, including the water molecules, by the method of the crystallographic refinement 12, 3], the comparison of the structures in detail and the discussion of the relationship between the structure and function can be performed. The accuracy of the refinement for both structures is detailed in table I. All the calculation of distances, angles and possible contacts were carried out using the MOLGRAPH program by Daikin Co on a graphic workstation, Iris Indigo Elan. The figures in this article are prepared using the program MOLGRAPH or MOLSCRIPT [ 10].

Fig 1. Amino acid sequence alignment between cytochr~me c3 molecules from D vulgaris Miyazaki F and D vulg.aris Hiidenborough with rms deviations of main chain atoms calculated from least-squares fitting of both structures. The ammo acid residues which are not common in both proteins (13 residues) are indicated by asterisks. Arabic numerals in italic indicate the number of hemes to which histidine or cysteine residues bind. Heme groups are numbered from the amino terminal of the sequence.

Results Overall structure
Overall structures of both cytochromes c3 were compared by Morimoto et al [31. The main chain backbone atoms were superimposed by the least squares method. The rms deviation of main chain atoms was calculated for each amino acid residue by leastsquares fitting of both structures. The mean deviation for all common atoms between the two structures was calculated to be 0.367 A. Only some loops and aminoterminal regions, which are fully exposed into the solvent regions, are deviated. The atoms which indicate large deviations between them show a tendency to have large values of solvent region accessibilities and temperature factors. The volumes of the molecules are calculated to be 10483 (DvM) and 10608 (DvH) A3 without water molecules (table I). The content of the solvent molecules is 66.6% for DvM and 6 2 . 1 % for DvH, respectively.

E in DvH), A13K, $27A, R44Q, G47A, $54N, V68A, N73G, V84L, V86T, D96E, KI02G, and EI07S [11]. Among them, N54, G73 in DVM are included in the hydrogen-bonding between symmetrically related molecules in crystal, whereas N73 and El07 are included in DvH crystal packing (table II). The two substitutions, N73G and E I07S seem to make distinctive differences between two molecules for the hydrogen-bonding patterns in the crystals, because of the large difference in the size of the side chains. The difference in the molecular packing in the crystal between two molecules also results in a difference of the solvent content of the crystals. The solvent content of the DvM cytochrome c~ crystal is larger than that of DvH (table I).

Crystal packing
The residues which participate into intermolecular hydrogen bonds as well as molecular packing in the crystal for both molecules are very different though the overall folding patterns are very similar. The molecule from DvH is rotated approximately 90 ° along the longest axis, the b-axis, in comparison with DvM cytochrome c3. The difference in the crystal packing between both cytochromes c3 results in the discrepancies of the unit cell dimensions in spite of the same space group of P2~2~21 (table I). There are 13 amino acid residues which are not conserved between both cytochromes c3 (fig 1), such as E 12D (D 12 in DvM cytochrome c3 substituted by the amino acid

The atoms involved in the four heme groups for both cytochromes c3 were superimposed (fig 2). The spatial arrangement of four heme groups for both molecules is almost identical, and even for propionic groups the root mean squares distance is 0.14 A. The heme groups are subjected to the so-called heme puckering. In the refinement procedure of both cytochromes c3 each heme group was refined so that only four pyrrole rings preserved their planarity. The difference of the heme puckering between both molecules was also inspected by superimposing each heme group separately by the least squares method. The root mean squares distance for each heme group between DvH and DvM is 0.20 (heine 1), 0.25 (heme 2), 0.21 (heine 3) and 0.26 A (heine 4). Since the four heme groups are numbered by the order of the bonding in the amino acid sequence from the amino-terminal, the numbering is different from that reported before [2, 3].

539 Accessibilities o f the hemes to solvent regions The degree of relative accessibility to the solvent region for each heme group was calculated without water molecules which are located in the electron density map and compared for both cytochromes c3. They were: 136 (heme 1), 168 (heme 2), 136 (heme 3) and 127 A2 (heme 4) for DvM [2] and 160, 155, ! ! 2 and 136 A 2 for DvH, respectively. t t e m e geometry The geometries of the ligated histidine residues are listed in table III.

541 stituted amino acid residues between two molecules which are located on the molecular surface cannot affect the geometry of the heine groups. V68A, which is buried into both molecules, is the only substitution located near the heme group (fig 3). There are two important differences with regard to the structures around hemes which are not caused by the replacement of the amino acid residues. The N~il atoms in imidazole tings of the ligated histidine residues are hydrogen-bonded by the nearest water molecules or carbonyl oxygen atoms (table HI). In both cytochrome c3 molecules, the imidazole rings of His35 (heme 2), His52 (heme 2), His70 (heme 4), and His83 (heme 3) are fixed by hydrogen-bonding to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the main chain, whereas those in His34 (heme 1) and Hisl06 (heme 4) are bonded to the water molecules. The water molecules are further hydrogen-bonded to the neighboring carbonyl oxygen atoms. The NS1 atom in His25 (heme 3) in DvM is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atom of Asn21 with 2.65 A. On the other hand, the NSI in DvH is hydrogen bonded to the oxygen atom of a neighboring water molecule with a distance of 2.89 A. Figure 4 shows the detailed comparison of some residues near heme 3 between both cytochrome c3 molecules. Both hemes 3 are superimposed further by the least-squares method. In DvH structure, the oxygen atom in Asn21 is slightly further located from the N~il atom in His25 with the distance of 3.20 A, but it is still possibly bonded to the nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring. In addition, there also exists one water molecule near the edge of heme 3 in DvM but the distance between the N61 atom in His25 and water molecule is 4.31/~, and that between carbonyl oxygen and the water molecule is 4.31 A. The N~il atom in His22 (heme l) in DvM is related to the water oxygen atom by the hydrogen bonding, whereas that in DvH makes van der Waals contact with the C/$1 atom in Leu9. Figure 5 shows the structure differences of the heme 1 pocket between DvH and DvM cytochromes c3. The side chain of Leu9 in DvH is rotated at 101 ° in z l value, and moved toward the N~il atom in His22, then the water molecule which is included in hydrogen bonding network to the

The atoms included in main chain are colored in grey. His52, which is located in the same side of the heme2, is contac! ,~,ithV68A. The side chain atoms of Val68 in DvH cytochrome c3 molecule are packed into the heme pocket so that they do not influence the spatial arrangement of the pyrrole rings of the heme 2 and the imidazole plane (see text).

Heme 3, the side chains of Phe20, Asn21, Thr24, His25, Leu97, and two water molecules in both cytochrome c3 molecules are superimposed by the least-squares method in the figure. Two water oxygen atoms and the atoms included in hydrogen bonding network are shown by the circles, and connected by the broken iines. The other atoms are connected by thick lines for DvM, and by thin lines for DvH. The position of the water molecule in DvM is slightly moved to the heme edge and the distance between the water molecules is calculated to be 2.01 .~ in this figure. imidazole ring of His22 in DvM is pushed out from the pocket of heme 1 in DvH. zole nature of the ligand can explain, at least partly, the extremely low redox potentials of the cytochrome c3 molecules in comparison with other c-type cytochromes. The spectrum of the C2 protons in the high field region was also reported for cytochrome c3 from DvH [15]. It is shown in figure 6 along with that from DvM. It is clear from the figure that two lower signals of the C2 protons in DvM shift to the higher field by several ppm in the spectrum of DvH. Therefore, it is most plausible that two major differences with regard to the heine structures between both proteins could be responsible for the spectral changes of the C2 protons of the ligated imidazole groups. The upfield shift of the C2 proton signals also can partly explain the lower redox potentials of the cytochrome c3 from DvH. Thus, the structural changes in DvH near heine groups are likely to affect the imidazole nature of the ligands. In addition, the redox potentials of the electron transfer centers have been considered to be related with the relative accessibilities to the solvent regions [16]. There is no distinctive evidence that the heine groups have different spatial arrangements and/or puckering. However, the relative accessibility to the sol-

Discussion
Macroscopic redox potentials of cytochrome c3 are reported to be -240, -297, -315 and -357 mV for DvM, and -263, -321, -329 and -381 mV for DvH, respectively [9]. The macroscopic redox potentials of DvM, cytochrome c3 are lower than those of DvM, by about 24 mV, except for the thir4 redox potential. The C2 proton signals of the coordinated imidazole groups were identified in a very high field region of the ~HNMR spectrum of cytochrome c3 [ 12]. It scattered in a wide range from -5 to -22 ppm. The C2 proton signal of a histidyl imidazole group usually appears in the region from 7 to 9 ppm. Such extremely upfield shift can be explained either by the tilting of the axial F.gand, or the imidazole nature of the ligand [13, 14]. Since no significant tilting was found in the crystal structure of both cytochrome c~ molecules, the major reason for the upfield shift was thought to be the imidazole nature of the histidine ligand [ 12].

The broad bands are assigned to the C2 protons of the coordinated imidazole groups [! 2]. vent region and the fine structure in the vicinity of the heme pocket are slightly different from heme to beme. As mentioned in the previous section, there are important features about the structures near hem¢ pockets in three heine groups, home l, hemc 2 and heme 3. There is one amino acid substitution, V68A between DvH and DvM cytochi'ume c3 molecules, which is buried inside of the molecule and located in the vicinity of heme 2. However, despite the fact that the valine 68 of DvH has a bulky side chain compared to the alanine 68 of DvM, the extra atoms of Cyl and Cy2 are placed in the heme pocket so that they do not influence the spatial arrangement of the pyrrole rings of the heme 2 and imidazole plane of histidine 52 (fig 3). It also does not distort the planarity of the conjugated imidazole and pyrrole rings. Therefore the amino acid substitution at about V68A seems to have no influence on the electron transfer system between them. The hydrogen bonding scheme including the NSI atom in His25, which is ligated to heme 3 is different between two molecules. Both histidine residues have one water molecule near them. When the hemes 3 in both structures are superimposed by the least-squares method, these water molecules are located within a distance of 2.01 ,/k of each other. The water molecules, the oxygen atoms in Asn21, and the NSI atom in His25 construct the hydrogen bonding network in the heine pocket in DvH cytochrome c3 within the distance of 3.20 A. In contrast, the water molecules in DvM are far located from the imidazole rings, there-

fore it can not form an efficient hydrogen bonding network in this heme pocket. This difference with regard to the structures between them can provoke a difference in the imidazole nature of the pocket in heine 3, ie the water molecule in DvH can make an electron passage between the active center and the molecular surface through the hydrogen bonding network. Therefore it can be one of the candidates which make the C2 proton signals in NMR spectra shift to the upfield. On the other hand, the accessible surface areas of this heme 3 in DvH have smaller values than those of DvM by 24 A 2. Usually these kind of features increase the redox potential [ 16]. This decrease in the accessible area is caused by the substituted residues between both molecules. The five substituted residues, $27A, V86T, D96E, K I02G, and E 107S are located in the vicinity of the heme 3. These side chain atoms can have an essential influence on the difference in solvent accessibility of the heme between both molecules. However, since the side chains of amino acid residues in molecular surface have the freedom of the conformation to some extent, and possibly vary its confermadon in solution, the accessibilities of the heine groups will also be altered. The situation in the vicinity of heme 1 pocket is slightly different. In DvM structure, there are two water molecules which fix the imidazole rings by hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, DvH structure does not have one of the water molecules, which is related with His22 in DvM. This water molecule in DvM is tightly bonded to the nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring with the temperature factor of 10.7 A,2, and is also hydrogen bonded to the carbonyi oxygen atom in Phe20, which has been considered to play an important role in the electron transfer of the cytochrome c3 molecule (fig 5). Since there is no other water molecule in this heme pocket in DvH, it is suggested that the deletion of the water molecule from the heme I pocket results in the increase of the hydrophobicity in the vicinity of this heme group. However, by the movement of the side chain of Leu9 towards the position of the water molecule, the accessible surface area of the CAA and CAD atom near propionic groups in heme 1 increase 4.73 A and 4.74 A2, respectively, and the total accessible area of this heme group is larger than that in DvM by 24/~,2. Since there are no bulky side chains of hydrophilic amino acids near Leu9, the solvent accessibility of this region might be also preserved in solution. This will make the redox potential of this heme group in DvH drop to some extent.
