Glutaredoxins (Grxs) catalyze reversible oxidation/reduction of protein disul®de groups and glutathione-containing mixed disul®de groups via an active site Grx-glutathione mixed disul®de (Grx-SG) intermediate. The NMR solution structure of the Escherichia coli Grx3 mixed disul®de with glutathione (Grx3-SG) was determined using a C14S mutant which traps this intermediate in the redox reaction. The structure contains a thioredoxin fold, with a well-de®ned binding site for glutathione which involves two intermolecular backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds forming an antiparallel intermolecular b-bridge between the protein and glutathione. The solution structure of E. coli Grx3-SG also suggests a binding site for a second glutathione in the reduction of the Grx3-SG intermediate, which is consistent with the speci®city of reduction observed in Grxs. Molecular details of the structure in relation to the stability of the intermediate and the activity of Grx3 as a reductant of glutathione mixed disul®de groups are discussed. A comparison of glutathione binding in Grx3-SG and ligand binding in other members of the thioredoxin superfamily is presented, which illustrates the highly conserved intermolecular interactions in this protein family.

Introduction
Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are ubiquitous redox active proteins present in most organisms from bacteria to man. In cells, Grx can support the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides by providing the essential enzyme ribonucleotide reductase

(RR) with reducing equivalents, in a reaction Ê coupled to oxidation of glutathione (GSH; Aslund et al., 1994; Holmgren, 1976, 1979a). In this reaction Grx acts as a dithiol, where the exposed Nterminal cysteine in the active site sequence CysPro-Tyr-Cys initiates attack on the substrate disul®de (Figure 1), followed by an intramolecular

attack of the C-terminal cysteine. Grx also acts as a speci®c reductant of glutathione-containing mixed disul®des in which it utilizes only the active site N-terminal cysteine thiol in a monothiol mechanism (Bushweller et al., 1992; Gravina & Mieyal, 1993; Holmgren, 1979b). In this reaction, reduced Grx interacts speci®cally with the glutathionyl moiety of a glutathione-containing mixed disul®de, forming a covalent Grx-SG mixed disul®de intermediate and releasing the non-glutathione component in reduced form. Reduced Grx is re-formed through reduction by a second GSH molecule. Glutathione reductase regenerates GSH by reducing the glutathione disul®de (GSSG). The glutathione-dependent activities distinguish Grx from the structurally related thioredoxin (Trx), which is reduced directly by Trx reductase (Holmgren, 1989). Trx has no preference for glutathione-containing mixed disul®des (Gravina & Mieyal, 1993; Holmgren, 1976, 1978), but readily reduces a wide variety of protein disul®des, including that of RR (Holmgren, 1985). Because of the strong preference for glutathione mixed disul®des, Grxs have been proposed to participate in enzyme regulation, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress (Gilbert, 1984; Gravina & Mieyal, 1993). Under normal conditions, the redox state of the cytoplasm is not conducive to the formation of structural disul®de bonds, but during oxidative stress the elevated levels of GSSG can cause glutathionylation of thiols in the cytoplasm (Cotgreave & Gerdes, 1998). Deactivation by glutathionylation has been demonstrated in vitro for a number of proteins (Bandyopadhyay et al., 1998; Davis et al., 1997; Gilbert, 1984). One example is the HIV-1 protease, which is inhibited by glutathionylation of an exposed cysteine (Cys95). Grx ef®ciently deglutathionylates the same cysteine (Davis et al.,

1997), thus providing an ef®cient means of regulating protease activity. The role of Grx in these systems is to reactivate the enzyme by removing glutathione, thereby liberating a reduced substrate thiol. Three Grxs (Grx1-3) have been identi®ed and Ê characterized in Escherichia coli (Aslund et al., 1994, 1996; Vlamis-Gardikas et al., 1997), each containing the active site sequence Cys-Pro-TyrCys. Grx2 is an atypical Grx with a molecular mass of 24 kDa, compared with the typical molecular mass of 9-12 kDa of other known Grxs (Vlamis-Gardikas et al., 1997). The structure of Grx1 has been determined in the reduced (Sodano et al., 1991), oxidized (Xia et al., 1992) and glutathione mixed disul®de forms (Bushweller et al., 1994) by NMR spectroscopy. The secondary structure of reduced Grx3 determined by NMR spectroscopy was shown to be Ê very similar to that of Grx1 (Aslund et al., 1996), indicating the presence of the Trx fold (Martin, 1995) in Grx3. In spite of their overall structural similarity, these two Grxs have very different Ê redox potentials (ÁE0H  35 mV; Aslund et al., 1997). The two proteins also display different substrate speci®cites. Unlike Grx1, Grx3 is a poor hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase, but has a higher activity as reductant Ê of glutathione mixed disul®de groups (Aslund et al., 1994). Based on the three-dimensional structure of T4 È Grx (Holmgren, 1978; Soderberg et al., 1978), a groove on the protein surface was proposed as a binding site for glutathione (Nikkola et al., 1991). The subsequent NMR structure of the E. coli Grx1-SG complex (Bushweller et al., 1994) provided direct structural evidence for such a glutathione binding site, largely in accord with the modeling study. Although the precision of the glutathione conformation and positioning was too low to establish all binding interactions unequivocally, it was clear that glutathione was bound in a unique orientation with several ionic and hydrogen bond interactions, similar to the situation observed in glutathione S-transferases (GSTs; Dirr et al., 1994). We have determined the NMR solution structure of the E. coli Grx3-SG mixed disul®de. The structure of the complex is of signi®cantly higher precision than that of the Grx1-SG complex. The binding mode of the glutathione substrate is overall similar to that observed in Grx1-SG. In addition to the well-de®ned binding site for the covalently bound glutathione ligand, the structure of the Grx3-SG complex suggests a possible binding site for the second GSH substrate in the monothiol mechanism which could explain the speci®city of Grxs to GSH in the regeneration step (Srinivasan et al., 1997). Comparison of the Grx3-SG complex to structures of complexes formed by other members of the Trx superfamily provides a unifying picture of substrate recognition for this large family of proteins.

543 C65Y. Based on virtually complete 1H and 15N assignments, 1167 distance constraints were derived from NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) spectra (Table 2), including 21 intermolecular distance constraints between Grx3 and glutathione. A total of 63 3JHNHa coupling constants were measured to derive dihedral angle constraints. Coupling constants 3JHaHb and 3JNHb provided unambiguous stereospeci®c assignments for 17 b-methylene protons. Additionally, the following torsion angles were restricted based on a qualitative evaluation of COSY (correlated spectroscopy) and NOESY cross-peaks: w2 of Ser14 and g-GluGS, and w3 of Arg49. Stereospeci®c assignments for methyl groups of two leucine residues, 20 and 31, were adopted from data for the oxidized form of Grx3 which has very similar 1H and 15 N chemical shifts, except for the active site region Ê È (A. Sandstrom, F.A., A.H., G.O. & K.D.B., unpublished results). The chemical shifts for these two leucine residues were identical in the two data sets. Further stereospeci®c assignments were obtained during the course of re®nement. In the ®nal input, 35 of 47 non-degenerate b-methylene protons, eight of 20 non-degenerate g-methylene protons, three of seven non-degenerate d-methylene protons, as well as all the valine and six of seven leucine methyl groups, and all asparagine and glutamine d and e-amino protons, respectively, were stereospeci®cally assigned. The structure of the Grx3-SG complex was calculated using the program DYANA, starting from 100 random conformations. The 20 conformers Ê with the lowest target functions (<0.58 A2) were selected for energy re®nement. The ensemble of 20 energy-re®ned conformers satis®es the experimenFigure 2. Amino acid sequence alignment of Grx3 and selected Grxs. Sequences are as described Ê ÈÈ by aAslund et al. (1996), bHoog È et al. (1983), cSjoberg & Holmgren (1972), dYang et al. (1989), e Padilla et al. (1995), fMcFarlan et al., 1992). The amino acid sequences were aligned based on the three-dimensional structures of pig Grx (Katti et al., 1995), T4 È Grx (Soderberg et al., 1978), E. coli Grx1 (Bushweller et al., 1994) and E. coli Grx3 (this work), and the secondary structure of human Grx (Sun et al., 1997). The residue numbering refers to Grx3. Conserved active site residues are highlighted (light). Charged residues implicated in glutathione binding are also highlighted (dark). Segments of helix (thin) and strand (thick) identi®ed by PROMOTIF (Hutchinson & Thornton, 1996) are underlined.

Results
Enzymatic activity Wild-type Grx3 contains a third cysteine (C65) in addition to the two active site redox active cysteine residues (Figure 2). Since this additional cysteine can form either intermolecular disul®de-bonded oligomers or glutathione mixed disul®de bonds upon oxidation with GSSG, it was replaced using site-directed mutagenesis. In most Grxs, the amino acid in the homologous position is either cysteine, tyrosine, or phenylalanine, leading to our choice of tyrosine for replacement. In order to trap the Grx3SG mixed disul®de quantitatively, the C-terminal active site cysteine was mutated to serine (C14S). The activity of these mutants as reductants of glutathione mixed disul®des and as reductants of ribonucleotide reductase is shown in Table 1. The C65Y mutation had essentially no effect on glutathione mixed disul®de activity as measured by the HED assay (see Materials and Methods). The C14S and C14S/C65Y mutants retained 36 and 31 % of the activity as glutathione mixed disul®de reductants, respectively, as compared with the wild-type and C65Y mutants. These values are very similar to the 33 % activity reported for the C14S mutant of Grx1 (Bushweller et al., 1992). The activities of the Grx3 C14S and C14S/C65Y mutants as reductants of ribonucleotide reductase were dramatically reduced, as also found for the analogous C14S mutant of Grx1, indicating that a dithiol mechanism is required for this reaction. Structure determination The structure of the E. coli Grx3-SG complex was determined using the Grx3 double mutant C14S/

tal input data well (Table 2), and is chosen to represent the NMR structure of the Grx3-SG complex. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of protein backbone atoms (N, Ca, CH ) of the ®nal set of Ê 20 conformers (Figure 3(a)) is 0.57 A relative to the mean structure. The RMSD of the glutathione backbone atoms (Ca, Cb, Cg, Cd of g-GluGS and N, Ê Ca, CH of CysGS and GlyGS) is 1.10 A when the protein backbone atoms are superimposed. This Ê RMSD decreases to 0.40 A when superimposing the glutathione backbone atoms (Figure 3(b)). This implies that although the conformation of the glutathione is as precisely de®ned as the polypeptide backbone, there is a signi®cant amount of variability in the orientation between the protein and the ligand. In a Ramachandran plot, 86 % of the nonglycine residues are located within the most favored regions, with 13 % in the additionally allowed regions, and 1 % in the generously allowed region, using the criteria of the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1996). Description of the structure Grx3 forms a three-layer aba sandwich, consisting of a bab and a bba motif (b1a1b2, b3b4a3) with a connecting helix (a2). Additionally, the C terminus forms a short helix (a4) (Figure 4). The

same basic fold is found not only in other thiol disul®de oxidoreductases, Grxs, Trxs, protein disul®de isomerases (PDI) and DsbA, but also in the glutathione-binding domain of the GSTs and the glutathione peroxidases (Martin, 1995). Residues identi®ed in a-helical segments in the Grx3-SG complex are: 11-24, 37-48, 64-74 and 76-81. Helix 3 ends in a classical Gly-based Schellman capping motif (Milner-White, 1988) with hydrogen bonds between Gly75 HN/Asp72 OH and Gly76 HN/ Leu71 OH , and average values of f and c for Gly75 of 80  and 41  , respectively. The protein has a central four-stranded mixed b-sheet containing residues 2-7, 29-33, 54-58 and 60-62, where b2 runs parallel with b1 and strands b3 and b4 form a b-hairpin motif. The peptide bond preceding Pro53 was identi®ed as cis from the large NOE between Val52 Ha and Pro53 Ha, and the absence of NOEs between Val52 Ha and Pro53 Hd2/d3, and was constrained as such in the structure calculation. With the exception of the glutathione peroxidases, cis proline is found in a homologous position in all known structures of the Trx superfamily. In 9 out of the 20 conformers, residues 55 and 62-63 are identi®ed as classic b-bulges. A b-bulge opposite the cis proline is also a conserved feature in the superfamily.

Interactions between glutathione and Grx-3 The cysteine of glutathione (CysGS) is covalently bound to Cys11 of Grx3 through a disul®de bond. The torsion angle of this disul®de bond (w3) is 86(Æ6)  in 17 of the 20 conformers, and is classi®ed as a right-handed spiral (Hutchinson & Thornton, 1996). The carbonyl oxygen and the amide hydrogen atoms of CysGS form hydrogen bonds to the

amide hydrogen (in all conformers) and carbonyl oxygen atoms (in 11/20 conformers), respectively, of Val52 which is the residue preceding the conserved cis proline (Figure 5). These two intermole-

546 cular backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds thus form an antiparallel b-bridge (Kabsch & Sander, 1983) between the protein and glutathione. The a-carboxylate of the C-terminal residue of glutathione, GlyGS has two possible salt bridge partners on the protein surface (Figures 5 and 6), at least one of which is found within hydrogenbonding distance in more than half of the conformers (12/20). These interactions involve the amino Ê hydrogen atoms of Lys8 which are within 2.4 A distance in 7/20 conformers, and the guanidino hydrogen atoms of Arg40, which are also located Ê within 2.4 A distance in 7/20 conformers. 3 The JHaHb coupling constants (10.9, 4.6 Hz, respectively) and the Hb2/b3-Hg2/g3 COSY and NOESY cross-peak patterns of the N-terminal residue of glutathione, g-GluGS, show that this end of the glutathione is also conformationally restricted, although the a-carboxylate and the a-amino group appear disordered in the NMR ensemble due to the absence of assignable protons for these groups (Figure 3(a) and (b)). It is thus possible that these charged terminal groups are in fact at de®ned positions, similar to the situation in the crystal structures of GST-glutathione complexes where the acarboxylate and the a-amino groups of g-GluGS form well-de®ned salt bridges with complementary side-chain charges on the protein. In Grx3-SG the guanidino group of Arg49 and carboxylate of Asp67 can provide complementary charges for the g-GluGS a-carboxylate and the a-amino groups, respectively. When forming these salt bridges, gGluGS ®lls a continuation of the binding groove on the protein surface, comprising residues Gly63, Gly64, Tyr13 and Thr51. Although a fully extended conformation of the g-GluGS chain is completely consistent with the experimental data set, it was not sampled by the present 20 conformers due to

the absence of constraints with the a-carboxylate and the a-amino groups. Both the residues forming the groove and two of the residues implicated in favorable ionic interactions (Lys8, Asp67) are highly conserved among the Grxs (Figure 2) but not in other members of the superfamily (Eklund et al., 1984). Residues Arg40 and Arg49 in Grx3 are located in a region with comparatively large structural differences between the different glutaredoxin groups, yet a comparison with pig Grx (Katti et al., 1995) reveals two arginine side-chains (Arg67 and Arg71) in roughly analogous positions in the structure, which could provide the corresponding interactions. Modeling studies suggest these residues contribute to the glutathione binding site in the mammalian Grxs (Nikkola et al., 1991). The presence of glutathione in the Grx3-SG mixed disul®de perturbs the chemical shifts of several residues compared with reduced wild-type Ê (Aslund et al., 1996) or oxidized C65Y mutant Grx3 Ê (A.S., F.A., A.H., G.O. & K.D.B., unpublished results). Compared with the oxidized Grx3 C65Y mutant, large chemical shift perturbations (>0.5 ppm) at, or close to, the active site loop (residues 8-16 and 33-35), were observed for the amide protons of Val52, Tyr65 and Asp66. The HN resonance of Val52 is shifted down®eld due to the hydrogen bond to the CysGS OH . The CysGS HN resonance (at 9.6 ppm) is also shifted compared with the corresponding shift in free GSH (8.2 ppm; York et al., 1987), due to the hydrogen bond between CysGS HN and Val52 OH . No hydrogen bond acceptor explaining the 0.9 ppm down®eld shift of Tyr65 HN could be identi®ed. The down®eld shift of Asp66 HN by 1.4 ppm (compared with the oxidized form) can be explained by a hydrogen bond with the Tyr13 OZ present in 7/20 conformers. In the remainder of the conformers this distance is Ê still short (< 3 A) in 17/20 conformers. Chemical shifts of other possible hydrogen bond donors in this region display little variation between the different oxidation states of Grx3. Comparison with E. coli Grx-1 A comparison of the NMR structures of E. coli Grx3-SG and the mixed disul®de complex with E. coli Grx1 (Bushweller et al., 1994) shows similar three-dimensional structures as expected from the 33 % sequence identity (Figure 2). Aligning and comparing the backbone heavy atoms of residues 2-5, 11-24, 28-33 and 49-74 in Grx3-SG with residues 2-5, 11-24, 33-38 and 56-81 in Grx1-SG yields Ê an average pairwise RMSD of 1.22(Æ0.53) A. Helix 1 is shorter by one turn at the C terminus than the corresponding helix in Grx1-SG, which results in a tighter turn between helix 1 and strand 2. Helix 2 in Grx1-SG is longer than in Grx3-SG, but is interrupted at residue 43, resulting in two helical segments including residues 37-42 and 44-53. The b-hairpin motif immediately following helix 2 is very similar in the two proteins. The Schellman

motif at the end of helix 3 in Grx3-SG results in a sharp bend, bringing helix 4 and the C terminus into close proximity with the N terminus. In this respect, Grx3 is more similar to the mammalian Grxs (Katti et al., 1995; Padilla et al., 1995; Sun et al., 1998) than to Grx1, where this feature is absent. The glutathione binding modes in Grx1-SG and Grx3-SG are overall very similar, with a notable difference: the signi®cant down®eld shift of the HN resonance of Thr73 in Grx1-SG compared with the oxidized form was reported to arise from hydrogen bonding to the a-carboxylate of g-GluGS. The corresponding atoms in Grx3-SG are beyond hydrogenbonding distance in all conformers that represent the solution structure. An explanation for a similar down®eld shift of the amide proton of Asp66 in Grx3-SG is the observed hydrogen bond to the phenolic oxygen of Tyr13 (see above). Although the non-active site mutation (C65Y) precedes Asp66 and is a potential complicating factor in this interpretation, the side-chain of Tyr65 extends away from the active site in the NMR structure and is unlikely to interfere with the interaction described above. Furthermore, the active site tyrosine is highly conserved among Grxs, and may have an important role in the enzymatic mechanism (see Discussion). In this context it is noteworthy that T4 Grx mutants, in which the active site tyrosine was replaced, were completely inactive (Nikkola et al., 1991).

Discussion
Ligand binding in Grx3 and other members of the Trx superfamily Glutathione binding in Grx3 may be compared with the mode of substrate recognition in other members of the Trx superfamily. Structures are available for the complexes of Grx1 and GST with glutathione (Bushweller et al., 1994; Sinning et al., Â 1993) and Trx with T7 DNA polymerase (Doublie et al., 1998) or peptides from NFkB (Qin et al., 1995) or Ref-1 (Qin et al., 1996). Grx, GST and Trx share a common folding motif at the active site, including the positioning of the active site cysteine residues at the N terminus of an a-helix and a loop with a conserved cis proline (residue 53 in Grx3; Martin, 1995), but differ largely in size, function and speci®city. The conservation of the ligand binding motif is best illustrated by the alignment of ®ve residues in the loop containing the conserved cis proline and the backbone atoms of either CysGS in Grx1; the S-benzylcysteine of the glutathione analogue in the complex with GST; or Thr327 of T7 DNA polymerase in the complex with Trx (Figure 7(a)-(c)). The b-sheet-like arrangement of the peptide ligands ensures that they are appropriately positioned for interaction with the enzyme active site. This is not only valid for cysteine-containing peptides, but also for interactions which do not involve a redox reaction, as exempli®ed by the complex between Trx and T7

548 Â DNA polymerase (Doublie et al., 1998). In the proÂ cessivity domain (Doublie et al., 1998), the polymerase complexes reduced E. coli Trx with a high af®nity, whereas oxidized Trx does not bind to the polymerase. This speci®city seems to be at least partly explained by hydrogen bonding between the side-chains of Thr327 of the polymerase and Â the active site Cys32 of reduced Trx (Doublie et al., 1998). It is remarkable how closely the conformation of the disul®de bond in Grx3-SG is matched by the side-chains of Cys32 (Trx) and Thr327 (T7 polymerase) in the non-covalent complex between the T7 polymerase and Trx (Figure 7(c)). Substrate speci®city in the different enzymes is otherwise usually determined by residues other than the active site cysteine residues. The GSTs, catalyzing the glutathionylation of a variety of both endogenous and xenobiotic substances, have a well-de®ned and highly conserved binding site for glutathione (Dirr et al., 1994). Similarly, Grx1 and Grx3 bind glutathione in a groove on the protein surface with the chain direction guided by interaction with complementary charged sidechains of the protein. Trx, DsbA and PDI do not form a binding groove able to complement the glutathione charges, consistent with their lack of speci®city for glutathione-containing mixed disul®de È groups (Holmgren, 1979a; Lundstrom-Ljung & Holmgren, 1995). Nonetheless, in Trx, ionic interactions appear to be a decisive factor in determining the orientation of the ligand which can be either parallel (Qin et al., 1995) or antiparallel (Qin et al., 1996). Ligand interactions in the Trx superfamily thus combine two general elements of protein-ligand recognition: polypeptide association via b strand-like backbone hydrogen bonds as seen, È Â for example, in the serine proteinases (Branden & Tooze, 1991), and the ability to accommodate different substrates in two opposite orientations via appropriate complementary surfaces, as observed in interactions of peptides with SH3 domains (Katz, 1997). Structure/function relationships in Grx 3 Grxs and Trxs are both families of redox-active proteins with redox potentials between À200 and Ê À270 mV (Aslund et al., 1997). While Trxs act primarily as protein disul®de reductants, Grxs have, in addition, a unique activity as a speci®c reductant of glutathione mixed disul®des (Figure 1). Grx3 has very low activity in the dithiol mechanism, as exempli®ed by the reaction with RR, but is highly active in the HED (2-hyoboxythyl disul®de) assay which samples activity in the monothiol pathway (Table 1). It has been noted that the Grxs are missing a residue corresponding with Asp26 in Trx (Chivers & Raines, 1997) which has a marked impact on the fast intramolecular reaction of E. coli Trx (Chivers & Raines, 1997; Dyson et al., 1997; LeMaster et al., 1997). However, such residues are perhaps not to be expected in Grxs, since longer

lifetimes of Grx-SG intermediates open a pathway not favored in Trxs (Figure 1). The rate of breakdown of the Grx-SG intermediate determines which of the two pathways will dominate. If the intramolecular reaction (leading to oxidized enzyme) is comparatively slow, reduction by an external nucleophile will be favored (leading to reduced enzyme). Under physiological conditions the most abundant external nucleophile in the cytoplasm is reduced glutathione (pKa 8.7-9.2; Benesch & Benesch, 1955; Szajewski & Whitesides, 1980). The side-chain conformation of Ser14 is well de®ned by the NMR data, since the hydroxyl proton resonance was observed in the NMR spectra, allowing both assignment of NOE cross-peaks to this atom and restriction of the Ser14 w2 torsion angle. Likewise, in the reduced form of the wildtype protein the thiol proton of Cys14 was observed, with similar coupling constants (3JHNHa, 3 Ê JHaHb, and 3JHbHg) and NOEs (Aslund et al., 1996; Ê K.N., F.A., S. Meunier, A.H., G.O., & K.D.B., unpublished results). Assuming that a cysteine at position 14 would have a similar side-chain conformation as serine in the C14S mutant used in the structure determination of Grx3-SG, one ®nds that the Cys14 thiol would have an unfavorable conformation for attack on Cys11. The hydroxyl group of Ser14 is turned away from the Cys11 Sg with the b-methylene group of Ser14 between the two (Figure 5), and a 180  w1 rotation of this side-chain would have to precede an intramolecular reaction. A similar conformation is observed for Ser14 in the Grx1SG complex. However, the disul®de in Grx1 is not of suf®cient precision to allow a comparison of the relative position to Ser14. It is also worth noting that the reduction of Grx3-SG is facilitated by the Ê low pKa of the protein thiolate (<5.5; K.D.B., F.A., S. Meunier, A.H. & G.O., unpublished results) which enhances the ability of Grx3 to act as a leaving group (Szajewski & Whitesides, 1980). Structural implications for the enzymatic mechanism Although the reduction of the Grx-SG can be achieved by a number of small thiol groups, it has been shown for human Grx that the reduction by GSH occurs at an approximately 20-fold higher rate than expected from its thiol pKa value (Srinivasan et al., 1997). The reason for this rate enhancement is not understood. The effect could be due to the a-carboxylate of g-GluGS acting as a base in the deprotonation of the reacting thiol, as has been proposed for glutathione S-transferase A1-1 (Widersten et al., 1996). However, the structure of the Grx3-SG complex reveals another possibility in the case of the Grxs. When the Sg of a second glutathione molecule approaches the bound CysGS Sg atom in the mixed disul®de to within Ê 2.0 A, the a-carboxylate and a-amino groups of g-GluGS of the approaching glutathione molecule

GSSG was removed by gel ®ltration on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia), followed by extensive ultra®ltration using 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and a YM-3 membrane (Millipore;. 2H2O was added to a ®nal concentration of 7 %, resulting in ®nal protein concentrations of 5.0 mM and 2.8 mM for the 15N-labeled and unlabeled sample, respectively. The protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coef®cient of 5120 MÀ1cmÀ1 estimated from the amino acid composition of the mutant (Gill & von Hippel, 1989). Enzymatic assays Ribonucleotide reductase activity was assayed essentially as described (Holmgren, 1979b). Activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of [3H]CDP to [3H]dCDP by 20 mg E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (subunits R1 and R2 in equal proportions, provided by ProÈ fessor B.-M. Sjoberg, Stockholm University) in a ®nal volume of 120 ml, using 1 mM DTT as a reductant. The samples were incubated at 37  C for 30 minutes using a concentration of 3.3 mM Grx3 and mutants thereof. GSH-disul®de oxidoreductase assays (HED assays) were performed as described by Holmgren (1979a), measuring the Grx-catalyzed reduction of b-hydroxyethyl disul®de by GSH at the expense of NADPH as monitored at 340 nm. A standard of puri®ed E. coli Grx1 was used in each experiment as a positive control. One unit was de®ned as the oxidation of one mmol of Ê NADPH per minute (Holmgren & Aslund, 1995). NMR data collection All spectra were recorded at a 1H frequency of 600 MHz on a Bruker DMX 600 NMR spectrometer. The sequence-speci®c resonance assignments were obtained essentially as described for the reduced form of wt Grx3 Ê (Aslund et al., 1996), except that the SCUBA scheme (Brown et al., 1988) was used in experiments recorded for assignment purposes. Distance constraints were collected from three different NOESY spectra recorded with 40 ms mixing time: 3D NOESY-15N-HSQC (Talluri & Wagner, 1996) with 32 Â 512 Â 2048 data points (resolution in t1 was improved by linear prediction to 64 data points), using t1max  8 ms, t2max  40 ms, t3max  128 ms and a total recording time of 44 hours; 2D-NOESY (Rance et al., 1985) with 1200 x 4096 data points, t1max  75 ms, t2max  256 ms and a total recording time of 34 hours; and an o1-decoupled NOESY (Otting et al., 1990) with 1600 Â 4096 data points, using t1max  200 ms, t2max  256 ms and a total recording time of ten hours. The 3JHNHa coupling constants were measured from a 2D 15 N-HSQC spectrum (Szyperski et al., 1992), and from the 2D NOESY spectrum by line-®tting using the program INFIT (Szyperski et al., 1992); 3JHaHb coupling constants were measured from a small ¯ip angle COSY spectrum (Aue et al., 1976; Mueller, 1987), and heteronuclear 3JNHb coupling constants were qualitatively measured from a 2D HNHB spectrum (Archer et al., 1991). Additionally, a few side-chain torsion angles were restricted based on a qualitative evaluation of the COSY and NOESY cross-peaks. With both Cys14 Hb protons stereospeci®cally assigned, a small Hb2-Hg COSY crosspeak and a large Hb3-Hg COSY cross-peak, together with large Hb2-Hg and small Hb3-Hg NOESY cross-peaks are consistent with a À60  rotamer position, and restricted conservatively to À60(Æ60)  in the structure calculations.

can be oriented such that these charged groups ®nd complementary charges in the Arg16 guanidino group and Asp66 side-chain carboxylate, respectively (Figure 6). In this orientation, the second substrate would extend across the aromatic ring of Tyr13, thus utilizing most of the remainder of the hydrophobic interaction surface. Such a mechanism could in part explain the observed kinetic behavior of human Grx (Srinivasan et al., 1997). A movement of the tyrosine side-chain upon reduction of the enzyme could then displace the subsequently formed GSSG from the active site. Movement of the tyrosine side-chain is suggested by the observation of a hydrogen bond between the phenolic oxygen of Tyr13 and Asp66 HN in the Grx3-SG complex (see Results), which is not present in preliminary NMR structures of the reduced Ê and oxidized forms of Grx3 (K.D.B., A.S., F.A., S. Meunier, A.H. & G.O., unpublished results). Sequence alignment of a number of Grxs shows that one of the charged residues in Grx3, Arg16, proposed for speci®c ionic interaction with the second glutathione, is largely conserved among the Grxs (Figure 2). The second interacting residue, Asp66, is found to be either Asp, Thr or Ser in the aligned sequences, all of which have similar sized side-chains with hydrogen-bonding capabilities. A Grx-like protein isolated from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum which appears to contain no glutathione or glutathione-like cytosolic thiol and has no activity as a glutathione mixed disul®de reductant (McFarlan et al., 1992), has been included in the sequence comparison. In this protein, only the Grx consensus active site sequence Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys and the non-speci®c substrate binding residues Val-Pro are the same as in the other Grxs. The amino acids identi®ed as responsible for glutathione-speci®c interactions are not conserved. Residue 65 of Grx3 is solvent-exposed and mutation of this residue to Tyr did not affect the enzymatic activities (Table 1). However, glutathionylation of this cysteine would interfere sterically with the proposed second interaction surface for GSH, and it seems possible that this single cysteine, which is present also in the mammalian Grxs, could have a regulatory role.

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with a pET24D-plasmid containing the gene for Grx3 C14S/C65Y Ê (F.A., G. Spyrou & A.H., unpublished results). The protein was expressed and puri®ed essentially as described Ê (Aslund et al., 1994, 1996) with the exception that the af®nity chromatography step was omitted. Two samples were prepared for NMR spectroscopy: one with uniform 15 N-labeling and one without isotope labeling. Both samples were reduced with 10 mM DTT in 100 mM phosphate buffer containing 1 mM EDTA at pH 8.0. Unlabeled glutathione disul®de (GSSG) was subsequently added to a concentration of 100 mM. Excess

Using a similar strategy, w2 of g-Glu and w3 of Arg49 were each found to be consistent with a 180  rotamer and were restricted to 180(Æ60)  . Slowly exchanging amide protons were identi®ed by exchanging the 15N-labeled sample into 2H2O by rapid gel ®ltration on a NAP-5 column (Pharmacia) preequilibrated with 2H2O. 15N-HSQC spectra were recorded 20 minutes, eight hours and 28 hours after initiating exchange. The duration of each experiment was 20 minutes.

NMR Structure of E. coli Grx3-SG Mixed Disul®de Complex Protein Data Bank accession number The coordinates of the 20 ®nal energy-re®ned DYANA conformers of the E. coli Grx3-SG mixed disul®de complex, together with the complete list of experimental NMR constraints and 15N and 1H chemical shifts, have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Databank, with the accession code 3GRX.

Structure calculations Peak volumes were converted to upper distance conÊ È straints (2.4-5.5 A) using the program CALIBA (Guntert et al., 1991). Dihedral angle constraints for f, c and w1, and stereospeci®c assignments for b-methylene hydrogen È atoms were obtained with the program HABAS (Guntert et al., 1991). Additional stereospeci®c assignments were obtained during the re®nement procedure using the proÈ gram GLOMSA (Guntert et al., 1991). Structures were calculated with the program DYANA, using torsion È angle dynamics and simulated annealing (Guntert et al., 1997). The complex was treated as a single molecule in the calculations, with the C terminus of the protein and the N terminus of the glutathione connected through a generic 20 residue pseudo-atom linker provided by the program DYANA. These so-called linker residues contain three pseudo-atoms which can penetrate atoms in the Ê molecule without steric penalty, 1 A bond lengths, and 90  bond angles. One rotatable bond separates two linker residues and in an extended conformation, a 20 resiÊ due linker segment would be approximately 40 A long. This is suf®cient not to arti®cially constrain the proteinpeptide interactions. The glutathione molecule was treated as a tripeptide, using a modi®ed library entry for the g-Glu residue. The intermolecular disul®de was enforced Ê in a standard manner by imposing a range of 2.0-2.1 A Ê between Sg atoms and a range of 3.0-3.1 A between Cb È and Sg atoms (Guntert et al., 1997). Starting from 100 random conformers, each was annealed in 8000 steps. Conformers with low residual constraint violations were converted to the appropriate format, which includes removal of the pseudo-atom linker, and energy-miniÊ mized with a 6 A layer of explicit water using the program OPAL.

Structure analysis Analysis of structural motifs in Grx3 was performed using the program PROMOTIF (version 2.0; Hutchinson & Thornton, 1996). A residue was considered to be in a certain secondary structure element, if it was found to belong to this type in a majority of the 20 energy re®ned conformers. The secondary structures of E. coli Grx1 (PDB accession code 1GRX), T4 Grx (1AAZ), and pig Grx (1KTE) were analyzed with the same program. RMSD values were calculated using the program MOLMOL (version 2.5; Koradi et al., 1996), with which all pictures were also created. Ramachandran plots were analyzed using the criteria of PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1996) as implemented in the program DYANA È (version 1.4; Guntert et al., 1997).
