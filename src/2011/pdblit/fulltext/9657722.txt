MALDI-MS should, therefore, be very useful for the mass determination of defined RNA analytes such as ribosomal RNA. All results reported above were obtained with only limited efforts in sample purification. In contrast, more extensive sample purification, particularly removal of alkali cations, is normally required in UV-MALDIMS (17) and ESI-MS (6, 8) of nucleic acids, and similar requirements have been reported for IR-MALDI-MS with succinic acid as matrix (11). We therefore speculate that the tolerance against impurities may be a particular feature of the glycerol matrix. Mass resolution is an important parameter in mass spectrometry. In all spectra, except that of the small 21-nt sample of Fig. 2A, the mass resolution was limited by a sloping high-mass edge of the peaks. It is believed that this peak broadening is caused by adduct ions of as yet unknown origin. It is not likely that glycerol is the major contributor to these adducts, because not even a trace of glycerol adducts peaks was identified in the highresolution spectrum of a small oligonucleotide (Fig. 1A). More sophisticated purification procedures might result in a substantial improvement in mass resolution.

Structure of the Escherichia coli RNA Polymerase Subunit Amino-Terminal Domain
Gongyi Zhang and Seth A. Darst*
The 2.5 angstrom resolution x-ray crystal structure of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) subunit amino-terminal domain ( NTD), which is necessary and sufficient to dimerize and assemble the other RNAP subunits into a transcriptionally active enzyme and contains all of the sequence elements conserved among eukaryotic homologs, has been determined. The NTD monomer comprises two distinct, flexibly linked domains, only one of which participates in the dimer interface. In the NTD dimer, a pair of helices from one monomer interact with the cognate helices of the other to form an extensive hydrophobic core. All of the determinants for interactions with the other RNAP subunits lie on one face of the NTD dimer. Sequence alignments, combined with secondary-structure predictions, support proposals that a heterodimer of the eukaryotic RNAP subunits related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpb3 and Rpb11 plays the role of the NTD dimer in prokaryotic RNAP. Escherichia coli RNAP comprises an essensubunits (each tial catalytic core of two 36.5 kD), one subunit (150.6 kD), and one subunit (155.2 kD), which are conserved in sequence from bacteria to human. In addition to playing key roles in transcription initiation, the subunit initiates RNAP assembly (1) by dimerizing into a platform with which the large and subunits interact. Deletion mutagenesis and limited proteolysis indicate that the subunit comprises two independently folded domains, the NH2-terminal domain (NTD; residues 8 to 235) and COOH-terminal domain (CTD; residues 249 to 329), connected by a flexible, 14-residue linker (Fig. 1A) (2). The CTD is dispensable for RNAP assembly and basal transcription but is required for the interaction with an upstream promoter element (3) and is the target for a wide array of transcription activators (4). The solution structure of CTD consists of a compact fold of four short helices (5). The NTD is essential in vivo and in vitro for RNAP assembly and basal transcription (2, 6). The regions of conserved sequence between homologs of prokaryotic, archaebacterial, chloroplast, and eukaryotic RNAPs ( motifs 1 and 2) (Fig. 1A) are contained within the NTD (7), as are the

determinants for interaction with the RNAP and subunits (2, 6, 8­12). We crystallized a mutant NTD with an Arg to Ala substitution at position 45 ( NTDR45A) because we were unable to obtain crystals of wild-type NTD suitable for structure determination (13). The structure was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and refined to a resolution of 2.5 Å (Table 1). The 26-kD NTD monomer comprises two domains, each containing a distinct hydrophobic core (Fig. 1B). Domain 1 contains NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences (residues 1 to 52 and 180 to 235), and domain 2 contains the intervening sequence (residues 53 to 179) (Fig. 2). Each domain has an / fold. Domain 1 contains a four-stranded antiparallel sheet (S1, S2, S10, and S11) and two nearly orthogonal helices (H1 and H3), whereas domain 2 contains seven strands in an antiparallel arrangement (S3 to S9) and one helix (H2) (Fig. 1B). The NTD dimer forms an elongated, flat structure with dimensions of about 120 Å by 60 Å by 25 Å (Fig. 1B). Almost all of the monomer-monomer interactions that form the dimer interface arise from H1 and H3 in domain 1 (Fig. 3). The unusual dimer interface can be described as two pairs of nearly orthogonal helices (one pair from each monomer) that interlock like two V's intersecting through their open ends, resulting in two pairs of antiparallel helices abutting each other with orthogonal orientations (Figs.

1B and 3). The primary monomer-monomer interaction occurs through an antiparallel coiled-coil­like interaction between H3 of monomer 1 (H31) and H3 of monomer 2 (H32). The other pair of antiparallel helices (H11 and H12) are shifted slightly apart and do not make extensive interactions with each other, but they contribute to the dimer interface by making hydrophobic interactions with H3 of the opposite monomer. The extensive hydrophobic interface sandwiched between the orthogonal pairs of antiparallel helices accounts for the high stability of the dimer. The hydrophobic core of the dimer interface is made up of one residue from S2, six residues within or adjacent to H1, and seven residues from H3 (Figs. 2 and 3). Over these 14 positions, hydrophobic residues are nearly absolutely conserved among homologs from eukaryotes, such as proteins related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpb3 and Rpb11 (Fig. 2). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains four crystallographically independent NTD monomers. The overall fold of each monomer is the same, but comparison of

Table 1. Summary of crystallographic analysis. NTDR45A (19) (15 mg/ml) was crystallized by vapor diffusion against 5 mM -mercapotethanol, 0.2 M MgCl2, 100 mM tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl (pH 8.6 to 8.9), and 18 to 22% polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) at 4°C. Heavy-atom derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals for 4 hours in 1 mM HgCl2, 12 hours in 1 mM MetHgCl and MetHgPO4, 24 hours in 5 mM K2PtCl4, and 1 week in 10 mM UO2Ac2, all dissolved in the crystallization solution. For cryocrystallography, crystals were soaked in steps of increasing PEG400 concentration (2% each step every 30 min) into 40% PEG400 before flash-freezing. Data were collected in the laboratory or at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X4a (native II, HgCl2 derivative, and Se derivative only) on an R-axis IV area detector, and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK ( Z. Otwinowski and W. Minor). Mercury positions were located manually by Patterson methods with PHASES (20) and confirmed with HEAVY (21) and SHELX-90 (22) Additional heavy-atom sites were located in cross-phased difference Fouriers. Heavyatom parameter refinement and solvent flattening were carried out with PHASES. By use of this initial electron density map, all four copies of domain 1 within the asymmetric unit were nearly completely modeled, whereas only partial polyalanine models of the four copies of domain 2 could be construct-

ed. Three noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators were determined mapping copies 2, 3, and 4 of domain 1 onto copy 1, and the partial models of domain 2 were similarly determined, for a total of six NCS operators. The map was improved by NCS averaging between the four copies of domain 1 and separately between the four copies of domain 2 in the asymmetric unit with DM (23). Map interpretation and model building were done with the program O (24). The map was improved by cycles of refinement with X-PLOR (25) with NCS constraints (six total constraints, as above), and phase combination with SIGMAA (26). A final refinement was performed with relaxed NCS restraints. The final model contains residues 1 to 161 and 165 to 232 for molecule one, residues 1 to 159 and 165 to 235 for molecule two, residues 1 to 159 and 168 to 235 for molecule 3, and residues 1 to 160 and 165 to 235 for molecule four. Water molecules were added if they had at least one hydrogen bond with a protein atom or with other waters, and they were kept after refinement if the B factor remained below 40 Å2. A total of 250 water molecules were added in the final refinement. Stereochemical values are all within or better than the expected range for 2.5 Å structure, as determined with PROCHECK (27). The coordinates have been submitted to the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.

scribed as a hinge motion with a range in all directions of at least 15° (14), with the hinge centered in the vicinity of Pro52/Gly53 (in the strand connecting domain 1 to domain 2) and Pro179 (in the connection from domain 2 back to domain 1). The high conservation of Pro and Gly residues at these positions (Fig. 2) suggests that the flexible linkage between domains 1 and 2 is an evolutionarily conserved feature, implying some functional consequence. Mutagenesis and hydroxyl-radical protein footprinting studies have localized determinants in that are important for interactions with and , all within motifs 1 and 2 of the NTD (Fig. 2) (2, 6, 8­12). These are mapped onto the NTD structure in Fig. 4. It is not known at present how these interactions with and are distributed between the NTD monomers. For clarity, the data are presented such that the determinants involved in interactions are shown on one monomer and the determinants involved in interactions are shown on the other. Of particular interest are two point substitutions, at positions 45 and 48, that cause defects in binding (10). Both of these positions lie on the solvent-exposed face of H1 within the region most strongly protected from hydroxyl-radical cleavage by binding of (Fig. 4). These observations together strongly support the conclusion that this exposed face of H1, and Arg45 and Leu48 in particular, directly interact with . A two­amino acid insertion at position 80 also results in defective binding (9), and this site lies immediately adjacent to a second region of the footprint on (Fig. 4). Small insertions at positions 108 and 200 cause defects in binding without affecting assembly of 2 (11). These two sites fall within the regions of protected from hydroxyl-radical cleavage by the binding of . Two point substitutions at positions 86 and 173 also interfere wtih binding (10). Although far apart in the sequence, these two sites fall close to each other in the NTD structure (Fig. 4). However, these sites are far from the regions footprinted by binding,

and one of the substitutions, V173A, replaces a highly conserved buried hydrophobic residue with a less bulky residue, which might be expected to cause a structural perturbation or destabilization, thereby making interpretation of this pair of substitutions in terms of specific effects on binding less certain. Despite any caveats from the above considerations, it is clear that all of the regions of the peptide backbone that are protected from hydroxyl-radical cleavage by the presence of and , and all of the mutants that deleteriously affect the binding of or , are exposed on one face of the NTD dimer (Fig. 4). On the opposite face, sites known to interact with the other RNAP subunits are not found, and located on this face are the COOH-termini of the two NTD monomers (Fig. 4). Thus, the CTDs and the and subunits are located on opposite faces of the NTD structure. Although the CTD has been identified as the target for a wide array of transcription activators (4), at least one interaction between an activator (catabolite activator protein, or CAP) and NTD, which is essential for activation at class II CAP-dependent promoters, has been identified. The protein-protein interactions between CAP and NTD occur between the basic activating region 2 of CAP and a stretch of four acidic residues, Glu162Glu163-Asp164-Glu165, of NTD (15). This region of the NTD structure comprises a highly exposed loop (Fig. 4, shown on only one NTD monomer). A short stretch of residues (160 to 163) in this region is disordered in the crystal structure. The largest subunits of prokaryotic RNAPs ( and ) exhibit strong sequence conservation with homologs in eukaryotic RNAPs (16). Less obvious evolutionary relationships have been proposed between and two families of eukaryotic RNAP subunits related to S. cerevisiae Rpb3 and Rpb11, and recent studies suggest that an Rpb3-Rpb11 heterodimer serves as the eukaryotic analog of the prokaryotic 2 homodimer (17). A sequence alignment of 5 Rpb3 homologs, 5 Rpb11 homologs, 17 prokaryotic sequences, and 6 chloroplast sequences was performed, taking into consideration the predicted secondary structure for the eukaryotic proteins (18) and the structure of E. coli NTD. The sequence and predicted secondary structure of the Rpb3 and Rpb11 homologs align very well with sequences of corresponding to domain 1. With one exception, gaps or insertions occur only in exposed loops between secondary structural elements and are expected to be compatible with the NTD fold. The exception is one large gap in the Rpb11 homologs that corresponds to domain 2, which is completely lacking. This also seems to be compatible with the NTD fold because the COOHterminal end of the first domain 1 fragment (the COOH-terminal end of H1) is less than 6 Å from the NH2-terminal end of the second domain 1 fragment (near the NH2-terminus of S10). These considerations, combined with the observation already noted that all of the hydrophobic residues that comprise the hydrophobic core of the dimer interface are nearly absolutely conserved in the Rpb3 and Rpb11 homologs, support the suggestion that an Rpb3-Rpb11 heterodimer plays the role of the 2 homodimer in prokaryotes. The Rpb3-Rpb11 dimer interface is predicted to be structurally very similar to the 2 dimer interface. Rpb3 is predicted to have a two-domain architecture like that of , with domain 1 structurally related to domain 1, whereas the structure of Rpb3 domain 2 diverges from that of . Rpb11 is predicted to be a single domain with a fold closely related to that of domain 1.

Cell Cycle Arrest by Vpr in HIV-1 Virions and Insensitivity to Antiretroviral Agents
Betty Poon, Kathie Grovit-Ferbas, Sheila A. Stewart, Irvin S. Y. Chen*
Expression of human immunodeficiency virus­type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr after productive infection of T cells induces cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. In the absence of de novo expression, HIV-1 Vpr packaged into virions still induced cell cycle arrest. Naturally noninfectious virus or virus rendered defective for infection by reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors were capable of inducing Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest. These results suggest a model whereby both infectious and noninfectious virions in vivo, such as those surrounding follicular dendritic cells, participate in immune suppression. The HIV-1 vpr gene encodes a 14-kD nuclear protein (Vpr) that is expressed within infected cells and is packaged into virions (1). Vpr is nonessential for viral replication in T cell lines and activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in vitro but it is necessary for efficient infection of nondividing cells such as macrophages (2, 3). Simian immunodeficiency virus­induced disease progression in macaques was attenuated when either vpr alone or both vpr and the related gene vpx were mutated, indicating that Vpr plays an important role in viral pathogenesis (4). Functions ascribed to Vpr include transport of the viral core into the nucleus of nondividB. Poon, S. A. Stewart, I. S. Y.

ing cells (3) and up-regulation of viral gene expression (5). One particularly intriguing function of Vpr is the ability to induce cell cycle arrest at the G2 checkpoint in a variety of mammalian cells, including human PBLs (6 ­ 8). This cell cycle arrest is characterized by alterations in the activation and phosphorylation state of Cdc2 kinase (7, 8) and resembles the G2 checkpoint induced by genotoxic agents (9). Over time, virally infected cells arrested in the G2 phase by Vpr die by apoptosis (10). In previous studies of Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest, we used HIV-1 bearing the murine Thy 1.2 reporter gene to allow concurrent visualization of infected cells by cell surface staining for Thy 1.2 and cell cycle status by staining with propidium iodide (9, 10). In some experiments, there was significant cell cycle arrest even in cells that were not productively infected (Thy 1.2 ), particularly at early time points before detectable Thy 1.2 expression (11). We tested the possibility that virion-associated Vpr can

mediate cell cycle arrest by generating a vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudo-typed HIV-1 that carried Vpr but was incapable of synthesizing it because of a frameshift mutation within vpr [HIV-1NL4-3-thy env(-)vprX]. Epitope-tagged Vpr was supplied to the virion by cotransfection, resulting in transcomplementation [HIV-1NL4-3-thy env(-)vprX BSVpr] (Fig. 1A) (12). Virion particles formed in this fashion contained Vpr in amounts comparable to wild-type virus [HIV-1NL4-3-thy env(-)]. Infection with virions complemented in trans with Vpr (VprX mutant Vpr in trans) resulted in cell cycle arrest in the Thy 1.2 population (G1/G2 0.26) compared with the Thy 1.2­ population (G1/G2 1.8) and with infection by the vprX mutant 1.9) (Fig. 1B). The level of arrest (G1/G2 induced by virion-associated Vpr alone was typically less than that observed with wild-type virus capable of de novo Vpr production (Fig. 1B), probably because of higher levels of Vpr expressed in cells de novo. Similar results were observed after infection of primary human PBLs and SupT1 T cells with an HIV-1 vector that packages Vpr but whose genome is defective for de novo expression of all HIV-1 genes (13). Virions pseudotyped with a CXCR-4 tropic HIV-1 envelope also induced cell cycle arrest (14) (Fig. 2B). The extent of G2 arrest induced by virion-associated Vpr varied depending on the virion preparation and cell type. However, HIV-1 particles prepared without envelope, but still containing Vpr within the viral core, did not induce G2 arrest (15). Thus, cell cycle arrest required both Vpr and viral entry into cells and was not the result of contaminating soluble Vpr in our virion preparations. Significantly, the cell cycle arrest observed with virion-associated Vpr was observed at low multiplicities of infection (MOI 0.15; Fig. 1B) (16 ).
