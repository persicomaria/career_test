Abstract Understanding the immune response to different CD8 T cell epitopes is important for the development of vaccines designed to promote protective cellular immunity. Recently, we have shown that vaccination with the PA224­233 /Db epitope of influenza virus was poorly protective in terms of viral clearance. To determine if other influenza virus epitopes behave in this manner, we analyzed the ability of three newly identified CD8 T cell epitopes and three previously defined epitopes to provide protection following vaccination and viral challenge. All six of the peptide-based vaccinations resulted in significantly increased numbers of epitope-specific CD8 T cells in the spleen. Interestingly, we found that vaccination with three peptides (HA332­340 , M1128­135 , or PA224­233 ) resulted in delayed viral clearance following infection. These findings indicate that some epitopes have a detrimental impact on viral clearance and have important implications for the development of vaccination strategies designed to provide protection against subsequent influenza virus challenge. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction CD8+ T cell responses play a major role in the control of primary influenza virus infection. Typically, an array of dominant and subdominant epitopes drive this T cell response with the bulk of the response directed at a limited number of dominant epitopes [1]. For example, it has been shown that the NP366­374 /Db , PA224­233 /Db , and PB1703­711 /Kb epitopes dominate the CD8+ T cell response to influenza virus infection in C57BL/6 mice with the rest of the response directed to several other subdominant epitopes [2­4]. It is generally believed vaccines designed to elicit cellular immune responses should target immunodominant epitopes. However, several studies have shown that subdominant epitopes can serve as good vaccine targets for the control of respiratory virus infections [5,6]. In addition, we have recently shown that some dominant T cell epitopes may be poorly protective, or even detrimental in terms of viral clearance [7]. For exam

ple, vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with the PA224­233 peptide was poorly protective against a subsequent influenza virus infection despite inducing CD8+ T cells that were capable of migrating to the lung and producing IFN and TNF following infection [8]. In this case, the delay in viral clearance was attributed to differential antigen processing and presentation of the PA224­233 /Db epitope by dendritic and non-dendritic cells which resulted in poor PA224­233 /Db epitope expression in lung epithelial cells [7]. The poor protective efficacy of the PA224­233 /Db epitope raised the question of whether this was a unique case or whether other epitopes derived from PA or from other influenza virus proteins expressed the same properties. Recently, Zhong et al. [4] reported the identification of 10 previously unidentified CD8 T cell epitopes within the PR8 strain of influenza. Their data suggested that several other epitopes, like PA224­233 /Db , are poorly processed and presented following infection of non-dendritic cells [4]. In this report, we analyzed the ability of these newly identified CD8 T cell epitopes to provide protection following vaccination. Interestingly, we found that vaccination with

either the HA332­340 or M1128­135 peptide, like the PA224­233 peptide, induced strong T cell responses, but delayed viral clearance.

2.4. Viral titers Homogenized lungs were serially diluted and injected into three 10 day old embryonated hen eggs per sample. After incubation at 35  C for 48 h, allantoic fluid from each egg was sampled and assayed for hemagglutinating activity using chicken red blood cells as previously described [12]. Samples were scored as positive when at least two of the three eggs contained hemagglutinating activity [12]. Statistical significance was determined using a Student's T test.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Viruses, animals, and infections The influenza virus A/PR8/34 (PR8, H1N1) was grown, stored and titrated as previously described [9]. Female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice (6­12 weeks) were anesthetized by i.p. injection with 2,2,2 tribromoethanol and infected intranasally with 300 50% egg infectious doses (EID50 ) of PR8 influenza virus. 2.2. Bone marrow derived dendritic cells Bone marrow was flushed from the femurs of C57BL/6 mice, depleted of erythrocytes, and 2 × 106 mononuclear cells were placed into a bacteriological Petri dish with media supplemented with 20 ng/ml recombinant murine granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor (rmGMCSF; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and incubated at 37  C with 10% CO2 [10]. On day 3, an additional 10 ml of CTM containing 20 ng/ml rmGM-CSF was added. On days 6 and 8, half of the cells were removed, centrifuged, and added back to the same plate in 10 ml of fresh media containing rmGM-CSF. On day 10 of the culture, the cells were resuspended at 5 × 106 /ml and incubated at 37  C for 3 h with peptide at a concentration of 50 g/ml [11]. Following peptide pulsing, the dendritic cells were washed and 100 l of cells in PBS were injected i.v. into mice at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells per mouse. Mice were intranasally challenged with influenza virus (PR8) on day 14 postvaccination. 2.3. Intracellular cytokine staining Cells isolated from the lungs or spleen were cultured at 37  C for 5 h in the presence of 10 g of the indicated peptide in 250 l of complete tumor medium (CTM) containing 10 g/ml Brefeldin A (BFA; Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) and 10 U/ml IL-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) [11]. After culture, the cells were blocked with monoclonal antibodies to FcRIII/II receptor (B-D Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) and stained with anti-CD8 conjugated to PerCP and anti-CD44 conjugated to APC (B-D Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) monoclonal antibodies in PBS/BFA. The cells were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde, permeabilized with buffer containing 0.5% saponin, and stained with anti-IFN conjugated to PE (B-D Pharmingen, San Jose, CA). 200,000 events were collected on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar) software.

3. Results Recently, Zhong et al. identified several new subdominant T cell epitopes that contribute to the CD8+ T cell response to primary influenza virus infection in C57BL/6 mice [4]. To determine the contribution of each epitope to the acute response, we intranasally infected mice with PR8 influenza virus and isolated T cells from the lung airways on day 10 post-infection. CD8+ T cells were analyzed for intracellular cytokine production following stimulation with each of the peptides (Fig. 1). As previously reported [2­4,7], most of the primary CD8+ T cell response was directed against three dominant epitopes, NP366­374 /Db , PA224­233 /Db , and PB1703­711 /Kb . However, seven additional subdominant epitopes also contributed to the T cell response in the lungs following infection. Combined, these 10 epitopes account for greater than 70% of the CD8 T cells producing IFN in the lungs following infection (Fig. 1). We next selected three subdominant epitopes, HA332­340 /Db , M1128­135 /Kb , and PA238­245 /Kb , to assess their efficacy as peptide vaccines. Mice were vaccinated with dendritic cells pulsed with the HA332­340 , M1128­135 , and PA238­245 peptides (or NP366­374 , PA224­233 , and PB1703­711 peptides as controls). Following vaccination, the mice were infected with the PR8 strain of influenza virus and the T cell response was analyzed 9 days later in the spleen using an intracellular cytokine assay. As shown in Fig. 2, T cells specific for the dominant epitopes (NP366­374 /Db , PA224­233 /Db , and PB1703­711 /Kb ) and subdomininant epitopes (HA332­340 /Db , M1128­135 /Kb , and PA238­245 /Kb ) were readily detected in the spleens of unvaccinated mice following infection. T cells specific for these epitopes were also detected in vaccinated mice except that the T cells specific for the vaccinating epitope were greatly enriched. For example, vaccination with PB1703­711 peptide pulsed dendritic cells increased the percentage of PB1703­711 /Kb specific CD8 T cells from 1.04% to 3.87% (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrated that vaccination increased the number of epitope-specific CD8 T cells responding to a subsequent influenza virus infection. We next examined the impact of vaccination and secondary infection upon the frequency of CD8+ T cells specific for other epitopes. As before, we examined the number of epitope specific CD8+ T cells day 9 post infection of vaccinated

On day 10 post infection, the lungs were collected, enriched for lymphocytes, and incubated for 5 h in the presence of the indicated peptides and Brefeldin A.

mice. As shown in Table 1, vaccination with some epitopes resulted in decreased frequencies CD8+ T cells of other specificities while other vaccinations had little impact on cells of differing specificity. For example, vaccination with dendritic cells pulsed with the PA224­233 peptide resulted in a decreased frequency of the dominant NP366­374 /Db epitope but had little impact on the frequencies of cells specific for subdominant epitopes such as HA332­340 /Db . Interestingly, vaccination with the subdominant epitopes HA332­340 /Db , M1128­135 /Kb , and PA238­245 /Kb did increase the T cells frequencies for the epitope of interest but had little impact on the frequency of CD8 T cells specific for the dominant epitopes (Table 1).

Finally, we examined the impact of vaccination upon viral clearance. Lungs were removed from unvaccinated or vaccinated mice that had been infected 9 days previously and the viral titer was determined using a standard hemagglutination assay. Day 9 was chosen because it was one day before viral clearance in normal mice and would therefore allow for the detection of delayed or accelerated viral control. Three independent experiments, consisting of four mice per experiment, were performed and the lungs were assayed individually. As previously described, NP366­374 vaccinated mice had significantly reduced viral titers and PA224­233 vaccinated mice had significantly increased viral titers as compared to unvaccinated controls (Fig. 3).

Fig. 2. Vaccination results in increased antigen-specific T cell frequencies in the spleen. C57BL/6 mice were administered 106 peptide pulsed dendritic cells via i.v. injection and 14 days post vaccination the mice were infected with 300 EID50 PR8 influenza virus. On day 9 post infection, splenocytes were removed and used in a standard intracellular cytokine assay. Panel A shows the number of IFN positive cells following incubation with the indicated peptide in both the unvaccinated and vaccinated mice. The data shown is the average from three independent experiments consisting of four mice per experiment. Panel B shows a representative dot plot from PB1703­711 vaccinated mice. The numbers show the percent IFN positive CD8 T cells in the spleen of control or vaccinated mice following stimulation with either PMA/Ionomycine or the PB1703­711 peptide. As a negative control, cells were left unstimulated.

C57BL/6 mice were administered 106 peptide pulsed dendritic cells via i.v. injection and on day 14 following vaccination the mice were intranasally infected with 300 EID50 PR8 influenza virus. The lungs were removed at day 9 post infection, homogenized, and used in an egg infectious assay to determine viral titers. Shown is the log viral titer present in the lungs from three independent experiments consisting of four mice per experiment. ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05.

PB1703­711 and PA238­245 , had no significant impact on viral titers at day 9. However, like vaccination with the PA224­233 peptide, vaccination with either the M1128­135 or HA332­340 peptide resulted in significantly increased viral titers at day 9 post infection (Fig. 3). Thus, these studies identify two additional epitopes (HA332­340 /Db and M1128­135 /Kb ) that have a detrimental impact upon viral clearance following vaccination. These data demonstrate that the PA224­233 /Db epitope is not unique in terms of its poor protective efficacy and that non-protective epitopes can also be derived from proteins other than PA.

4. Discussion Prior experiments had demonstrated that some T cells specific for the PA224­233 /Db epitope were poorly protective and could actually delay viral clearance in PA224­233 peptidevaccinated mice [7,8]. We were therefore interested in determining if the PA224­233 /Db epitope was unique in this regard or whether other epitopes expressed the same properties. In

this report, we vaccinated mice with six peptides derived from different proteins of the influenza virus and then assayed T cells numbers and determined viral clearance following secondary infection. Vaccination with all of the selected peptides resulted in increased numbers of CD8+ T cells in the spleen specific for the vaccination peptide. Interestingly, three of the peptide vaccinations (PA224­233 , HA332­340 , and M1128­135 ) resulted in significantly higher viral titers in the lungs as compared to unvaccinated mice. These data demonstrate that the PA224­233 /Db epitope is not unique in terms of its poor protective capacity and further demonstrate that phenotype is not restricted to epitopes derived from the PA protein [7,8]. Our previous work demonstrated that the PA224­233 /Db epitope was differentially presented by dendritic and nondendritic cells accounting for the inability of PA224­233 /Db specific cells to lyse virally infected lung epithelial cells and clear the infection [7,8]. Thus, it is possible that the other epitopes that resulted in delayed viral clearance (HA332­340 /Db and M1128­135 /Kb ), may also be differentially processed and presented by non-dendritic cells. In support of this, data by Zhong et al. showed that the HA332­340 /Db epitope was poorly expressed on infected EL4 cells and the M1128­135 /Kb epitope was only expressed following infection with high viral titers [4]. Thus, it appears that these epitopes, like PA224­233 /Db , are presented by dendritic cells and therefore can elicit T cells responses, but are poorly (or not) presented by non-dendritic cells, such as lung epithelial cells. Based on these observations, it is interesting to speculate that the delayed viral clearance in PA224­233 , HA332­340 , and M1128­135 peptide-vaccinated mice is due to excessive

456

production of T cells specific for epitopes that are not present on virally infected lung epithelial cells. However, an alternative possibility is that large numbers of T cells specific for the vaccinating antigen effectively crowd out protective NP366­374 /Db -specific T cells from the response in the lung. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that vaccination with the PA224­233 peptide also results in decreased migration of NP366­374 /Db -specific T cells into the lungs of infected mice (8). This effect may be most significant during the early stages of the infection where control of viral loads is especially important for the ultimate outcome of the infection. Yet another possibility to explain the detrimental effect of PA224­233 , HA332­340 , and M1128­135 peptide-vaccination on viral clearance is that T cells specific for these epitopes may elicit enhanced immunopathology. Changes in the status of physical and innate barriers in the lung could lead to enhanced viral spread and reduced viral control. Such alterations in lung immunopathology might further be influenced by the presence or absence of neutralizing antibodies. For example, the detrimental effects of peptide vaccination may disappear in the presence of neutralizing antibody. Clearly, a great deal more study is required to determine the mechanisms underlying protective and detrimental immune responses in the lung. Taken together, these observations have significant implications for peptide-based vaccines. In general, it is assumed that T cell epitopes selected naturally by the immune system are good choices with regard to peptide-based vaccines. However, some of these epitopes may have limited efficacy in terms of anti-viral control and may even lead to delayed viral clearance. In this regard, it should be emphasized that the data presented in the current report pertain only to the specific epitopes and MHC haplotype described here. Thus, it is essential that each epitope be individually analyzed to determine its relative efficacy. Over the long term, it will be essential to identify the mechanism(s) that lead to poor antiviral control in the face of strong T cell responses.
