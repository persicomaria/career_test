The optimization of the dihydronaphthyl[3,4-a]pyrrolo[3,4-c]carbazole-5-one R2 and R12 positions led to the identification of the first MLK1 and MLK3 subtype-selective inhibitors within the MLK family. Compounds 14 (CEP-5104) and 16 (CEP-6331) displayed good potency for MLK1 and MLK3 inhibition with a greater than 30- to 100-fold selectivity for related family members MLK2 and DLK. Compounds 14 and 16 were orally active in vivo in a mouse MPTP biochemical efficacy model that was comparable to the first-generation pan-MLK inhibitor 1 (CEP-1347). The MLK1 structure-activity relationships were supported by the first-reported X-ray crystal structure of MLK1 bound with 16.
Introduction The mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs) are critical upstream activating components of the stress-activated c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and they function to phosphorylate MAP kinase kinases MKK4 and MKK7 of the cascade. MKK4 and MKK7 activate the JNKs (JNK1-3) that phosphorylate the transcription factor cJun on Ser63 and Ser73, which is an early initiating event in the cell-death process.2,3 c-Jun phosphorylation mediates neuronal apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli, and it may contribute to the cell death that is associated with neurodegenerative pathological conditions.2 In Parkinson's disease (PD), compelling postmortem evidence indicates that neuronal apoptosis may be the underlying mode of cell death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, which is a primary cause of the hallmark locomotor deficits in the disease (akinesia, tremor, and postural instability).4 The characteristic features of PD suggest that a drug that is capable of attenuating nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration could theoretically slow the disease progression by providing therapy beyond that of neurotransmitter replacement, which is an elusive unmet medical need. Our efforts in the design and synthesis of MLK inhibitors in the indolocarbazole class identified 1 (CEP-1347)5 as a firstgeneration molecule that advanced through phase III clinical trials (Figure 1). 1 promoted neuronal survival in numerous in vitro and in vivo models5a,6 including attenuating the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity and dopamine (DA) transporter density in mice and monkeys following the administrationof1-methyl-4-phenyl-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP).5a,7 The chemistry objective for a subsequent follow-on, secondgeneration compound was to identify a fully synthetic entity to circumvent requirements for the fermented glycosolyated natural product (+)K-252a (2), which has a lower molecular weight and enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. Recently, we reported our work that identified the MLK pharmacophore in (+)K-252a

that led to an MLK1 and MLK3 subtype-selective dihydronaphthyl[3,4-a]pyrrolo[3,4-c]carbazole (DHN) scaffold.8 The 7-oxo derivative 3 demonstrated both enzyme and cellular activity with good selectivity. However, early preclinical studies showed that it suffered from metabolic instability and poor pharmacokinetic properties. We therefore focused our attention on optimizing the potency and properties of the 5-oxo regiomer 4. In this article, we report the optimization of positions R2 and R12, the MLK1 crystallography, the pharmacokinetic properties, and the oral in vivo activity for the MLK1 and MLK3 family-selective DHN analogs. Chemistry The 5-oxo carbazole analogs were synthesized via a Diels-Alder reaction as outlined in Scheme 1 using our

or under phase-transfer conditions (NaOH, N-tetrabutylammonium bromide, DCM/water) to produce 18-22 and 24-26 (Scheme 2). Results and Discussion In Vitro MLK1 and MLK3 Structure-Activity Relationships. The MLK1 and MLK3 enzyme inhibitory data are shown in Table 1. Analogs were screened for inhibition against baculoviral glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins that expressed the active human MLK1 and MLK3 kinase domains by using myelin basic protein as substrate.6c,8 The pan-MLK inhibitor 1 was used as a reference standard, and it displayed IC50 values of 38 and 64 nM for MLK1 and MLK3, respectively.5b 5-Oxo 4 was about 30 and 11 times weaker for MLK 1 and MLK3, respectively, compared to 1 (IC50 ) 1.1 and 0.72 µM, respectively.) A methoxy group was scanned to probe SAR around the B ring initially. This tactic revealed that the preferred position for substitution was 2 > 3 . 1. Compound 8 (2-methoxy) showed a 3- to 5-fold improvement in MLK1 and MLK3 potency, whereas substitution at the 1 position was not tolerated, and the 3-OMe analog was significantly weaker (data not shown). A 2-alkoxy group proved to be important as the OiPr in 9 improved potency 16-fold for MLK1 and 5-fold for MLK3 compared with 8, whereas the 2-OH in 10 showed less than 10% inhibition at 1 µM concentration (Table 1). A set of alkanols were next installed at N12 in accord with our previous work that demonstrated that the chirality of the (+)K252a 3-sugar alcohol was critical for trkA tyrosine kinase activity.10 Unfortunately, the ethanol analog 13 had only weak inhibitory activity versus MLK3 (IC50 ) 1 µM, comparable in potency to 4), whereas analogs with increased alkyl chain length or branching were devoid of activity (data not shown). Conversely, our exploring combinations of R2-alkoxy with R12 ethanol produced analogs with greater-than-additive potency. Ethanol 14 and propanol 15 displayed a 10- to 15-fold improvement in MLK potency compared with 4. The size of the O-alkyl ether at position 2 was critical for potency in the order iPr > Me > nPr > cAlkyl > Et > H. An optimum balance for MLK1 and MLK3 activity was obtained with R2 OMe (14) (IC50 ) 103 and 55 nM for MLK1 andMLK3, respectively) and OiPr (16) (IC50 ) 26 and 67 nM for MLK1 and MLK3, respectively). Substituting with larger, nonether groups at R2 or probing the region with heterocycles or donor and acceptor groups decreased but did not abolish the activity (see 18-26). (For examples, see 18-26.) The R12 donor OH group was critical for MLK activity because O-alkyl ethers or the reomoval of the hydroxyl dramatically decreased MLK activity (data not shown). MLK1 Cell Activity in Vitro. The potent examples 9, 14, 16, and 19 were evaluated in an MLK1 cell-based assay for the inhibition of MKK4 phosphorylation. MLK1 was transfected in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with dominant-negative MKK4 cDNA, and phospho-MKK4 was measured in an ELISAbased format, as previously described.6c,8 Compounds 14 and 16 (MLK1 enzyme IC50 ) 26 and 103 nM, respectively) displayed MLK1 cell activity that was relatable to the isolated enzyme activity with cell IC50 values of 127 and 33 nM, respectively (Table 1). Compounds 9 and 19 displayed approximately 3- and 7-fold shifts from the cell free-MLK1 enzyme activity. The cell translation of 14 and 16 compared favorably to the optimized semisynthetic clinical compound 1 (MLK1 enzyme IC50 ) 38 nM; MLK1 cell IC50 ) 72 nM).5b,6c MLK1/16 X-Ray Crystal Structure.

published methods for 3 and 4.8,9 The Diels-Alder reaction with ethyl cis- -cyanoacrylate and 2-(3,4-dihydronaphth-2-yl)1H-indole 5 in the presence of YtBr3 in toluene proceeded in a regioselective manner to produce the 3-ethoxycarbonyl isomer 6 (Scheme 1). The aromatization of tetrahydrocarbazoles using DDQ in toluene or acetonitrile cleanly produced the cyanoester carbazoles 7. Reductive cyclization (RaNi, H2, DMF, MeOH) produced lactams 8 and 9. The regiochemistry was confirmed by NMR experiments and crystallography, as previously described.9 A key synthetic transformation in the elaboration of the N12 structure-activity relationships (SAR) was the clean alkylation of the indole NH by the use of NaOH in acetone without hydrolysis of the ester or nitrile. The alkylation of cyanoester carbazole 7 with 2-bromoethyl benzyl ether produced the O-benzyl-protected 11 in >90% yield. On a large scale, it was more efficient to use a two-step hydrogenation process to produce the target alcohol lactams 14 and 16 than it was to use a one-pot procedure. Accordingly, the reductive cyclization of 11a and 11b by the use of RaNi/H2 in DMF/MeOH produced the O-benzyl lactam 12. O-debenzylation using Pd(OH)2/H2 in DMF produced the alcohol lactam in high yield and purity. We needed an efficient scalable method to produce 2-hydroxy-12ethanol 17 in high yield and purity so that it could be used as an intermediate to analog the 2-ether position. The best conditions we found to demethylate 14 were provided by a mixture of AlCl3 and ethane thiol in DCE. Similar conditions were used to convert 8 to 10. The alkylation of 17 with various alkyl halides was accomplished by the use of Cs2CO3 in CH3CN

we solved a cocrystal structure of 16 with the unphosphorylated MLK1 kinase domain (MLK1[T312A](136-406)) at 2.6 Å resolution (Table 2). This represents the first reported crystal structure that was solved in the MLK family. The topology of the MLK1 kinase domain in complex with 16 is similar to other protein kinases wherein the structure consists of a smaller N-terminal lobe, which is largely composed of sheets, and a C-terminal lobe, which is predominantly R-helical. The Nterminal domain comprises one R helix, RC (181-197), and a six-stranded sheet, 0 (137-139), 1 (144-150), 2 (158-163), 3 (166-174), 4 (206-211), and 5 (215-220) (Figure 2). The six-stranded sheet is also found in GSK-3 and p38, in contrast with the five-stranded sheet that is found in protein kinases such as FGFR, cMet, Abl, VEGFR2, CDK2, and EGFR. The additional strand 0 makes antiparallel -sheet hydrogen bonding interactions with 5. The C-terminal lobe comprises two strands and seven R helices. The two lobes are connected by a single-polypeptide-strand hinge region (220-224). Compound 16 is bound in the ATP pocket at the

hinge in a manner that is analogous to that of 111 and to the conformation of (+)K-252a (2) bound to the tyrosine kinase c-Met12 (Figure 2). 16 anchors at the hinge via two key hydrogen bonds (1.8 Å); the lactam N-H forms a strong hydrogen bond with the carbonyl backbone of Gly221 and the lactam CdO accepts a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Ala223 (Figure 3). The MLK1 ATP pocket is formed by hydrophobic residues Ile150, Phe155, Val158, Ala169, Phe195, and Ile204 from the N-terminal lobe; Leu275 and Phe295 from the C-terminal lobe; and Met220, Phe222, and Ala223 from the hinge region. Moreover, the apolar atoms of Gly151, Gly153, Gly226, Thr293, and Asp294 also participate in the formation of the pocket. This DFG-in structure had no density in the loop between strand and helix RC (chain segment 174-180) in the C-terminal domain and in part of the activation loop (294-319) chain segment 296-309. The binding conformation of 16 positions the 2-O-isopropyl moiety at the solvent channel where the ether oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the Arg230 side chain (2.5 Å) (Figure 3). An additional hydrophobic interaction between the Phe221 side chain and the iPr may account for the increased potency of 16 over 14. The N12 ethanol OH serves as an H-bond donor with the carbonyl backbone of Ser272 (2.1 Å) and is also in close proximity for electrostatic contacts to the polar side-chain residue of Asn273 (3.4 Å) and potentially Thr293 (4 Å).

nucleotide-binding loop 151-158 is closer to the active site in MLK1 compared with other kinases. A unique side-chain shift with Phe155 from the phosphorylation loop forms a hydrophobic interaction with the N12 ethyl side chain and also functions to cap the cleft and block solvent accessibility to the inhibitor. Kinase Selectivity Profile for 14 and 16. The first-generation clinical compound 1 was a pan-MLK inhibitor with IC50 values of 38, 64, 23 and 114 nM for MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, and DLK, respectively.5b,6c,8 Compound 14 had IC50 values of 103 and 55 nM for MLK1 and MLK3, respectively, 1.6 µM for MLK2, and >3 µM for DLK. Compound 16 had IC50 values of 26 and 65 nM for MLK1 and MLK3, respectively, 1.9 µM for MLK2, and >3 µM for DLK. Neither compound inhibited MLK6 or MLK7 (IC50 > 30 µM), which indicates a >30- to 100-fold selectivity for MLK1 or MLK3 (Table 3). Moreover, weak inhibition was demonstrated for other kinases within the stressactivated pathway, such as MKK4, MKK7, or JNK, and for serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases that are inhibited by (+)K252a or 1, such as protein kinase C5c (PKC) (mixture of Ca2+dependent isozymes R, , and ), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF-R2),10b and trkA5c,10b,13 (Table 3). 16 markedly better demonstrated FGF-R1 (>10 µM vs 210 nM) and VEGF-R1-3 selectivity compared with clinical compound 1, which had IC50 values for VEGF-1, VEGF-R2, and VEGF-

R3 of 209, 43, and 39 nM, respectively. When tested against a broader panel of 254 kinases at 1 µM concentration, 14 inhibited only 4 kinases (1.6%), whereas 16 inhibited 10 kinases (3.9%) with greater than 90% inhibition. Rat Pharmacokinetic Properties for 14 and 16. On the basis of the MLK1 and MLK3 enzyme and cellular potencies, 14 and 16 were evaluated in the rat for pharmacokinetic properties (Table 4). In a rat liver S9 preparation, both compounds showed 44% of parents remaining after 2 h of incubation in the presence of NADPH. The oral bioavailability for 16 was estimated to be 37% by determining the AUCs following iv (1 mg/kg) and po (5 mg/kg) administration over a 6 h period. The iv terminal half life was 0.8 h with a volume of distribution of 2.0 L/kg and a clearance rate of 28 mL/min/kg. The oral Cmax was 339 ng/mL (0.8 µM), and the brain-to-plasma ratio was approximately 0.5. Compound 14 also showed good oral bioavailability after iv (2 mg/kg) and po (4 mg/kg) administration measured over a 6 h period (F ) 57%; Cmax ) 572 ng/mL) (Table 4). In Vitro and in Vivo Activity in MPTP Models. MPTP is a potent and selective nigrostriatal DA neurotoxin that produces PD-like symptoms in humans, nonhuman primates, and mice.14 MPP+, the neurotoxic metabolite of MPTP, is selectively taken up in DA neurons and inhibits complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport.15 The subsequent activation of the JNK signaling pathway leads to apoptotic neuronal death in various cell-culture models of neurodegeneration.1,2 The MLKs function upstream of JNK to phosphorylate the dual-specificity MAPK kinases MKK4 and MKK7, which activate the MAP kinase JNK1 (see Figure 5). Correspondingly, MPP+ addition to SHSY5Y cells results in the activation of the JNK pathway16 and apoptotic cell death including nuclear chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and DNA laddering.17 Furthermore, MPTP administration to mice activates the JNK pathway in brain7b and elicits an increase in neurons with double-strand DNA breaks and chromatin clumping, which are additional markers

induced loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in mice7a and primates.5a 1 is a pan-MLK inhibitor and therefore cannot elucidate which MLKs are involved in the MKK4/JNK/c-Jun cell-death mechanism that is induced by MPTP. Previously, the pharmacological tools were not available to address these questions. The MLK1/3-selective inhibitors 14 and 16 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo in MPTP models of neurotoxicity. In vitro, 16 rescued human SH-SY5Y cells in a concentrationdependent manner following the treatment with MPP+ with an IC50 of 43 nM.16a In this assay, 16 was less potent than but equally as efficacious as 1 (Figure 4). 14 displayed an IC50 of 32 nM. Whereas 1 showed a pronounced inverted U-shaped dose response, this effect was not seen with 14 and was only moderately seen with 16 up to 1 µM concentration, which may be a reflection of the high kinase-selectivity profile. Previously, we reported that MPTP administration to mice increased levels of phosphoMKK4 (pMKK4) and phosphoJNK (pJNK) in the striatum and substantia nigra.7b Blocking the

MPTP-mediated increase in pMKK4, the immediate downstream target of the MLKs was used as a biochemical efficacy measure of peripherally administrated MLK inhibitors in the brain. Compounds 14 and 16 were administered orally at 6.7 mg/kg 2 h pre-MPTP and 2 h post-MPTP (40 mg/kg, sc). The substantia nigra from treated and control groups were dissected 2 h later, and levels of pMKK4 were measured by immunoblot.7 14 and 16 inhibited pMKK4 activation by 68 and 64%, respectively (Figure 5). The plasma levels 2 h postdose (4 h after MPTP) were 0.25 and 0.58 µM for 14 and 16, respectively. For comparison, the administration of 1 at 1.0 and 10 mg/kg sc inhibited pMKK4 activation by 45-50%.5a,7b Similar to 1, compounds 14 and 16 did not inhibit the MPP+ formation via MAO-B or the extent or rate of uptake by inhibition of the DA transporter (unpublished results). Two different models of MPTP-induced neurotoxicity can be produced by differential dosing of MPTP. The administration of a low dose (20 mg/kg sc) of MPTP produces an approximately 50% loss of striatal DA terminal markers, as measured by the specific DA uptake site ligand GBR-12935 binding, without affecting DA cell bodies in the substantia nigra, as measured by TH immunoreactivity.5a,7a Alternatively, the administration of a higher dose (40 mg/kg sc) results in a complete loss of striatal DA markers and about a 50% loss of substantia nigra cell bodies. Compounds 14 and 16 were evaluated for neuroprotection under both toxin-dosing conditions. The protection afforded by compound 16 was limited to striatal DA terminals after b.i.d. oral dosing in the low-dose MPTP model, whereas compound 14 protected both striatal DA terminals and cell bodies at oral doses that were as low as 2 mg/kg q.d. in the low-dose model. Conclusions The optimization of the R2 and R12 positions of the DHN scaffold showed that combining an R2-methoxy or an R2isopropoxy with an R12 ethanol produced analogs with greaterthan-additive potency and identified 14 and 16 as potent MLK1 and MLK3 subtype-selective inhibitors. 14 and 16 demonstrated oral in vivo activity in the mouse MPTP-activated MKK4 biochemical efficacy model, which was comparable to 1. In MPTP neuroprotection models, 14 was superior to 16 and is the subject of a pending detailed full pharmacology publication. The orally bioavailable MLK1/3 subtype inhibitors 14 and 16 are valuable tools that are helpful in delineating the critical role of the MLK kinases in the JNK pathway and in neuroprotection in various cell types and neuronal populations. Experimental Section
Chemistry. All reagents and anhydrous solvents were obtained from commercial sources and were used as received. 1H NMR specta were obtained on a Bruker 400 MHz instrument in the solvent indicated with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. We ran preparative chromatography using silica gel GF 20 × 20 cm2 1000 µm plates (Analtech). Coupling constants (J) are in Hertz (Hz). We ran analytical HPLC by using a Zorbax RX-C8 5 × 150 mm2 column eluting with a mixture of acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a gradient of 10-100%. 2-(6-Methoxy-3,4-dihydronaphth-2-yl)-1H-indole (5b). To a 3 L three-necked round-bottomed flask containing indole (40.0 g, 0.4 mol) in dry THF (1.1 L) under a nitrogen atmosphere at -65 °C was added n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexanes, 225.3 mL). After the mixture was stirred for 1 h, CO2(g) was passed through via a syringe for 10 min. The solution was then concentrated to half-volume at reduced pressure to remove excess CO2. The THF (400 mL) was replaced, and t-BuLi (235 mL of 1.7 M solution in hexanes) was then added dropwise at -65 °C. The solution was stirred for 1 h

and was treated with trimethyl borate (38.0 mL, 0.338 mol). The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h at -65 °C.

LCMS m/z: 452 (M + H). Mixed-Lineage Kinase Assays. The MLK1, MLK2 and MLK assays were performed by using the Millipore multiscreen trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in-plate format, as described previously.6c,8 Each 50 µL assay mixture contained 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 5 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM -glycerophosphate, Km level of ATP (60 µM for MLK1 or 100 µM for MLK2 and MLK3), 0.25 µCi [-32P]ATP, 0.1% BSA, 2% DMSO, and

500 µg/mL myelin basic protein. The reaction was initiated by adding purified recombinant kinases (50, 150, and 100 ng of GSTMLK1KD, GST-MLK2KD/LZ, and GST-MLK3KD, respectively). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold 50% TCA, and the proteins were allowed to precipitate for 30 min at 4 °C. The plates were then washed with ice-cold 25% TCA. A supermix scintillation cocktail was added, and the plates were allowed to equilibrate for 1 to 2 h prior to counting by the Wallac 1450 MicroBeta-Plus scintillation counter. The inhibition curves were generated for the compounds by plotting percent control activity versus log10 of the concentration of compound. The IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression using the sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation in GraphPad Prism as follows: y ) bottom + (top bottom)/(1 + 10(log IC50 - x) × hillslope), where y is the percent kinase activity at a given concentration of the compound, x is the logarithm of the concentration of the compound, "bottom" is the percent of control kinase activity at the highest compound concentration tested, and "top" is the percent of control kinase activity at the lowest compound concentration examined. The values for bottom and top were fixed at 0 and 100, respectively. IC50 values were reported as the average of duplicates that agree within 20%. Other Kinase Assays. Inhibition assays for recombinant receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, FGFR1, IRK, PDGFR , TIE2, TrkA, VEGF-R2) and serine/threonine kinases (CDK1, CDK2, DLK, JNK1, p38R, PKC) were performed as described previously.10b,19,20 Protein-Complex Preparation, Crystallization, and X-ray Data Collection. MLK111 (1.0 mg/mL in 20 mM HEPES, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4)) was incubated with 1 mM 16 for 30 min at 4 °C. Cocrystals of the enzyme11 and 16 were obtained by mixing 2 µL of the protein complex (1.7 mg/ml) in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1mM EDTA with 1 µL of the reservoir solution of 12% PEG20000, 200 mM Am2(SO4), and 100 mM MES (pH 6.5). The prepared complex was crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion by combining 3 µL of the protein-ligand solution with 1 µL of a reservoir solution containing 20% PEG 3350 and 0.2 M MgSO4 (pH 5.9). The crystals appeared in 5 to 6 days as thin plates and exhibited diffraction that was consistent with that of the orthorhombic space group P21212 (a ) 56.93, b ) 126.30, and c ) 41.36 Å) with 1 molecule of enzyme-inhibitor complex per asymmetric unit. Prior to data collection, the crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solutions composed of their mother liquors and 20% glycerol. After incubation for about 15 s, the crystals were flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 2.6 Å resolution at the NSLS X4A beamline (Brookhaven National Laboratory) on an ADSC CCD detector. We integrated and scaled diffraction intensities by using the Denzo and Scalepack programs.21 The final 2.6 Å data set for the crystal of the complex was 96.8% complete with an Rmerge of 0.079 (Table 2). Structure Determination and Model Refinement. The structure of the MLK1-16 complex was solved by molecular replacement using the EPMR program.22 The APO-MLK1 monomer structure (unpublished results) was used as the search model. The solution was found as one clear monomer in a search that used all data between 15 and 4 Å. The model was subsequently refined with CNS.23 Bound 16 could be clearly seen in the electron-density maps immediately after the first cycle of rigid-body refinement of the protein molecule alone. Iterative cycles of manual rebuilding with TOM24 and refinement with CNS resulted in a model of the complex at Rcryst ) 0.218 and Rfree) 0.282. The final structure contains 1913 protein atoms, one inhibitor molecule, one SO4-2 ion and 43 water molecules for a single monomer of the complex in the asymmetric unit. None of the nonglycine residues lie in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The X-ray data collection and crystallographic refinement statistics are represented in Table 2. Coordinates. The coordinates for MLK1-16 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code is 3DTC). Rat Pharmacokinetics.
