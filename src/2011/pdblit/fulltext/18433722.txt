Abstract Investigation into the mechanism of cytokine signaling led to the discovery of the JAK/STAT pathway. Following the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptor, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are activated by members of the janus activated kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases. Once activated, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of target genes. During the past several years significant progress has been made in the characterization of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade, including the identification of multiple STATs and regulatory proteins. Seven STATs have been identified in mammals. The vital role these STATs play in the biological response to cytokines has been demonstrated through the generation of murine `knockout' models. These mice will be invaluable in carefully elucidating the role STATs play in regulating the host response to various stresses. Similarly, the solution of the crystal structure of two STATs has and will continue to facilitate our understanding of how STATs function. This review will highlight these exciting developments in JAK/STAT signaling. q 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Cytokines regulate numerous aspects of hematopoiesis and immune response. They mediate their responses through activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) comprise a family of seven structurally and functionally related proteins: Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5a and Stat5b, Stat6. JAKs (janus kinases) represent a family of four non-receptor tyrosine kinases, Jak1, Jak2, Jak3 and Tyk2. These kinases selectively phosphorylate STATs, leading to their activation. Once activated, STAT then play a critical role in regulating innate and acquired host immune responses. Dysregulation of at least two STAT signaling cascades (i.e. Stat3 and Stat5) is associated with cellular transformation. STATs transduce signals for the large hematopoietin subfamily of cytokines, and the conserved family of the receptors they bind. This includes the interferon (IFN)

family (IFN-a/b, IFN-g; interleukin (IL)-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22), the gp 130 family (IL-6, IL-11, OSM, LIF, CT-1, GCSF, IL-12, IL-23, Leptin, CTNF, NNT-1/BSF-3), the gC family, (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21) and the single chain family (Epo, GH, PRL, Tpo) of the receptors (reviewed in Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). STATs can also be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R). Several members of the Gprotein-coupled receptors, a primitive family, have also been shown to signal through STATs (Leonard and O'Shea, 1998; Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). Signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway is initiated when a cytokine binds to its corresponding receptor (Fig. 1). This leads to conformational changes in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor, initiating activation of receptor associated members of the JAK family of kinases. The JAKs, in turn, mediate phosphorylation at the specific receptor tyrosine residues, which then serve as docking sites for STATs and other signaling molecules. Once recruited to the receptor, STATs also become phosphorylated by JAKs, on a single tyrosine residue. Activated STATs dissociate from the receptor, dimerize, translocate to the nucleus and bind to members of the GAS (gamma activated site) family of

STATs (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). However, these observations are less well established. There are four members of the JAK family in mammals, Jak1, Jak2, Jak3 and Tyk2. They are over 1000 amino acids in length, ranging in molecular weight from 120 to 130 kDa. Jak1, Jak2 and Tyk2 are expressed ubiquitously, whereas the expression of Jak3 is restricted to cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages (reviewed in Leonard and O'Shea, 1998). 2.2. JAK structure Comparison of JAK sequences reveals seven regions of high homology, JH1-JH7 (see Fig. 2). Although the biological activity of each of these regions has not been fully elucidated, several domains are well characterized (Leonard and O'Shea, 1998; Ihle, 2001). JH1 has been shown to encode the kinase. JH2 represents a pseudokinase domain, which appears to be required for JH1 catalytic activity (Yeh et al., 2000). The amino-terminal JAK homology domains, JH3­JH7, have been implicated in receptor association. However, the role of JH7 region in this interaction has not been confirmed.

enhancers. This review will focus on more recent developments in STAT signaling, highlighting structural studies, nuclear translocation, gene targeting, as well as newly identified regulatory molecules.

2. JAK kinases 2.1. JAKs in cytokine signaling When ligands bind to their receptors they initiate a cascade of intracellular phosphorylation events. However, members of the hematopoietin receptor family, which bind to type I and type II cytokines, possess no catalytic kinase activity. Rather, they rely on members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases to provide this activity. JAKs are constitutively associated with a proline-rich, membrane proximal domain of these receptors, often referred to as box1/box2 region (Ihle, 2001). Upon ligand stimulation, receptors undergo the conformational changes that bring JAKs into proximity of each other, enabling activation by trans-phosphorylation (Remy et al., 1999). Once activated, JAKs mediate signal transduction as outlined before (see Fig. 1). Several studies have also suggested that JAKs associate with the receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. CSFR-1, EGF-R, PDGF-R) and with G-protein-coupled receptors (e.g. angiotensin-R), and that enables these receptors to activate

2.2.1. Amino terminus The amino-terminal JAK region spans 550 amino acids and is relatively divergent between family members. Functionally the N-terminal domain has been implicated in receptor association and appears to play an important role in determining the specificity of this binding (Leonard and O'Shea, 1998; Ihle, 2001). Studies with amino-terminally chimeric JAKs indicate that JH6­7 serves as a minimal receptor interaction elements for Jak2 and Jak3 (Chen et al., 1997; Kohlhuber et al., 1997). In contrast, an additional JH segment is required for Tyk2 association with IFNAR1 (Yan et al., 1998); and the entire N-terminus appears to be required for Jak1 binding to the IFN-g receptor (Kohlhuber et al., 1997). More recent structural modeling has determined that JH3­JH4 region shares some similarity with SH2 domains, and that the JH4­JH7 region constitutes a FERM domain (Four-point-one, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) homology domain, which are known to mediate protein­ protein interactions (Girault et al., 1998). The FERM domain was initially implicated in heterotypic interactions between JAKs and other kinases (Zhu et al., 1999; Miyazaki et al., 1998). However, more recent studies have suggested that the FERM domain of Jak1 may be critical for interaction with the cytoplasmic portion of gp130 receptor (Hilkens et al., 2001 #2699). 2.2.2. The pseudokinase domain The presence of a pseudokinase domain distinguishes JAKs from other protein tyrosine kinases (Ihle, 2001). This kinase-like domain (KL) has all the structural features of a bona fide tyrosine kinase, except catalytic activity. Although the role of KL is not clear, there is growing

evidence that it regulates activity of the kinase domain. For example, deletion of KL leads to hyperactivation in Jak2. This phenomenon has also been reported for the Drosophila JAK, Tum-1 (reviewed in Leonard and O'Shea, 1998). This gain-of-function mutation in the Drosophila JAK that leads to a hematocyte tumor and has been mapped to KL (i.e. E695K). Although analogous mutations in Jak3 and Tyk2 do not lead to hyperactivity, they do appear to modulate kinase activity (Velazquez et al., 1995; Yeh et al., 2000). Studies have also suggested that KL may contribute to JAKSTAT interactions (Flores-Morales et al., 1998).

2.4. Jak2 Jak2 function was also initially studied through biochemical approaches. These studies implicated Jak2 in signaling by members of the single chain receptors (e.g. Epo-R, TpoR, GH-R, PRL-R), the IL-3 receptor family (IL-3R, IL-5R and GM-CSF-R), the gp130 receptor family and the class II receptor cytokine family (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). In contrast to Jak1, the Jak2 knockout mice exhibited an embryonic lethal phenotype, dying at the day 12.5 of gestation. Death has been attributed to a failure in definitive erythropoiesis, analogous to what has been observed in Epo 2 /2 knockout mouse (Wu et al., 1995; Neubauer et al., 1998; Parganas et al., 1998). These studies established that Jak2 activity is essential for Epo signaling. Although hematopoietic precursors can be rescued from Jak1 null livers, these cells are unresponsive to Tpo, IL-3 and GMCSF. They do, however, respond to G-CSF, suggesting that Jak2 function is redundant in granulocytic lineage. Likewise, Jak2 does not appear to be required for signal transduction by the IL-2 and IL-4 families. Additional studies have revealed defects in the response to IFN-g, but not IL-6 or IFN-a. Thus, Jak2 plays a critical role in transducing signals for Epo, IL-3, GM-CSF, IL-5, Tpo and IFN-g. 2.5. Jak3 Jak3 expression is largely restricted to hematopoietic cells, suggesting a more limited role in cytokine signal transduction (Leonard and O'Shea, 1998). Compelling biochemical studies implicated Jak3 in signaling by all receptors that employ the common gamma receptor chain, gC (e.g. IL-2R, IL-4R, IL-7R, IL-9R, IL-15R, and IL-21R (Leonard and O'Shea, 1998)). Consistent with studies, demonstrating that mice can survive in the absence of lymphocytes, Jak3 2 /2 mice grow normally in a specific pathogen free environment (Nosaka et al., 1995; Park et al., 1995; Thomis et al., 1995). However, Jak3 2 /2 mice demonstrate severe defects in lymphopoiesis, similar to that observed in mice deficient in gC, with which Jak3 associates (Cao et al., 1995). Consistent with an important role for Jak3 in IL-2 signaling, Jak3 null T cells are defective in negative selection (Saijo et al., 1997). This murine phenotype however stands in sharp contrast to Jak3 deficient humans. These patients have severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which manifests itself in a profound T cell defect, with normal B cells (Leonard and O'Shea, 1998). This difference has been attributed to IL-7, which is essential for pre-B cell growth in mice, but not in humans. In conclusion, Jak3 plays a vital role in lymphoid development. Jak3 2 /2 mice are defective in their response to IL-2, IL-4 and IL-7, yielding a SCID-like phenotype. 2.6. Tyk2 Tyk2, the founding member of the JAK family, was the first implicated in cytokine signaling when it was identified

2.2.3. The tyrosine kinase domain The conserved kinase domain found in JH1 exhibits classical features of a tyrosine kinase (Hubbard and Till, 2000). This includes conserved tyrosines that constitute a critical component of the activation loop; Y1038/Y1039 in JAK1, Y1007/Y1008 in JAK2, Y980/Y981 in JAK3, Y1054/ Y1055 in Tyk2 (Leonard and O'Shea, 1998). Phosphorylation of these dual tyrosines leads to the conformational changes that facilitate substrate binding (Hubbard and Till, 2000). The potential significance of differences amongst the JAKs in this regulatory region is currently under investigation.

2.3. Jak1 Numerous biochemical studies have indicated that Jak1 is involved in signaling by members of the IL-2 receptor family (IL-2R, IL-7R, IL-9R and IL-15R), the IL-4 receptor family (IL-4R, IL-13R), the gp130 receptor family (IL-6R, IL-11R, LIF-R, OSM-R CT-1R, CNTF-R, NNT-1R/BSF3R and Leptin-R) and class II cytokine receptors (type I IFN-R, type II IFN-R, IL-10R (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000)). Consistent with the pleiotropic function of these receptors, the Jak1 knockout mice exhibited an early postnatal lethal phenotype (Rodig et al., 1998). More careful analysis revealed that these mice suffered from a neurological lesion that rendered them defective in suckling. Identification of a similar defect in LIFRb knockout mice has suggested that a loss in LIF function accounts for this neurological defect (Li et al., 1995; Ware et al., 1995). Consistent with this, the response to LIF and IL-6 was substantially diminished in Jak1 2 /2 tissues. Jak1 2 /2 mice also exhibited significant defects in thymocyte and B cell production. This impaired lymphopoiesis has been attributed to defective responses to IL-7, which is important in early lymphocyte development (von Freeden-Jeffry et al., 1995). The absence of Jak1 also leads to profound defects in the biological response to type I and type II interferons. Finally, Jak1 2 /2 mice are also defective in their response to IL-10. Thus, Jak1 plays a critical role in mediation of biological responses to several major cytokine receptor families.

JH2 represents a pseudokinase domain, which appears to regulate JH1 catalytic activity. JH3­JH7 have been implicated in receptor association. STATs also share several conserved domains, including an amino-terminal domain (NH2), a coiled-coil domain, the DNA binding domain (DBD), a linker domain, an SH2 domain, and a tyrosine activation domain (circled P). The carboxy-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) is conserved in function but not in sequence. See text for details.

in a screen for mutants in IFN-a signaling (Velazquez et al., 1992). Subsequent biochemical studies suggested that Tyk2 also contributes to IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 signaling

(reviewed in Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). The relatively subtle defects in the Tyk2 2 /2 mice, especially in IFN-a/b signaling, were therefore unexpected (Karaghiosoff et al.,

2000; Shimoda et al., 2000). Tyk2 2 /2 MEF exhibited a strong (i.e. wild type) antiviral response to standard doses of IFN-a (e.g. 1000 U/ml). Likewise, the ability of Tyk2 2 /2 mice to resist viral infection differed only modestly from wild-type mice. In contrast to wild-type MEF cells, however, Tyk2 2 /2 cells exhibited a defect in their response to low doses of IFN-a (e.g. 10 U/ml). Further analysis determined that the response to IL-12 was defective, but not absent; and that the response to IL-10 was almost normal. No defects were observed in response to IL-6. Surprisingly, Tyk2 null macrophages exhibited a substantial defect in their response to LPS, but the nature of this defect, which is likely to be complicated, has not been elucidated (Bogdan et al., 2000). In conclusion, Tyk2 appears to be most important in mediating the biological response to IL-12 and LPS. 3. STATs The seven STAT proteins identified in mammals range in size from 750 and 850 amino acids. Both, the chromosomal distribution of these STATs, as well as the identification of STATs in more primitive eukaryotes, suggest that this family arose from a single primordial gene. Duplications of this locus appear to reflect an increasing need for cellto-cell communication as eukaryotes became more complex. Consistent with this evolutionary pattern, STATs share structurally and functionally conserved domains (Fig. 2). This includes the amino-terminal domain (NH2), the coiled-coiled domain (CCD), the DNA binding domain (DBD), the linker domain and the SH2/tyrosine activation domain. In contrast, the carboxy-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) is quite divergent and contributes to STAT specificity. Despite the fact that over 50 members of the hematopoietin family transduce signals through a more limited number of STATs, significant specificity is achieved. This is largely because the receptors that transduce signals for these cytokines can be placed into five structurally and functionally related subfamilies, each of which tend to transduce signals through a single STAT (see Table 1). Further specificity can be attributed both to tissue specific patterns of expression (i.e. of ligands and receptors) and the activation of additional signaling pathways by these receptors. This section will highlight the structural, functional and regulatory properties of the mammalian STAT family. 3.1. Structural features of STAT proteins All seven members of the STAT family of transcription factors share common features. Six conserved domains have been identified through structural and functional analysis (Fig. 2). The four core domains contact each other by large interdomain interfaces, suggesting that structural changes induced in one domain may also affect other domains.

3.1.1. N-terminal domain The N-terminal domain, comprising approximately 130 amino acids, is conserved among the STATs (51% sequence identity between Stat1 and Stat4; 20% between Stat5 and

Stat6). It represents an independently folded and stable moiety, which can be cleaved from the full-length molecule by limited proteolysis (Vinkemeier et al., 1996). The crystal structure of the N-terminus of Stat4 (amino acids (aa) 1­ 124) reveals a dimer (see Fig. 3 (Vinkemeier et al., 1998)). The interface of this dimer is formed by a ring-shaped element consisting of five short helices. Several studies suggest that this N-terminal dimerization promotes cooperativity of binding to tandem GAS elements (Vinkemeier et al., 1996; Xu et al., 1996; Vinkemeier et al., 1998). Other studies have suggested that the N-terminal STAT domain promotes interaction with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 (Horvath, 2000); the PIAS family (Shuai, 2000); receptor domains (Leung et al., 1996; Murphy et al., 2000b); and that it regulates nuclear translocation (Strehlow and Schindler, 1998). 3.1.2. Coiled-coil domain A flexible polypeptide chain (24 aa for Stat1 and 18 aa for Stat3) links the N-terminal domain to the coiled-coil domain (Fig. 3), which consists of four a-helices (approximately aa 135­315). The crystal structures of Stat1 and Stat3 reveal ° that this domain protrudes about 80 A laterally from the core structure (Becker et al., 1998; Chen et al., 1998). This forms a large predominantly hydrophilic surface that is available for specific interactions with other helical proteins. Interacting proteins include p48/IRF9, the transcription factor cJun, N-myc interacting protein (Nmi), and StIP (Horvath et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1999a; Zhu et al., 1999; Collum et al., 2000). More recently, studies have also implicated the coiled-coil domain in receptor binding, tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear export (Begitt et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2000). 3.1.3. DNA-binding domain The DNA binding domain (approximately aa 320­480) is a b-barrel with an immunoglobulin fold and lies carboxyterminal to the coiled-coil domain (see Fig. 3). This structure is reminiscent of the NF-k B and p53 DNA binding domains (Chen et al., 1998). Each STAT component of the dimer recognizes bases in the most proximal half GAS element (see Section 3.4). The number of direct contact sites between amino acid residues and DNA are modest, accounting for a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. Thus, cooperativity in DNA binding is likely to be important in effective transcriptional activity. Additionally, since the DNA binding domain is likely to exhibit a different conformation prior to activation, it is appealing to consider the possibility that it may have additional functions (McBride et al., 2000). 3.1.4. Linker domain The linker domain (aa 488­576 for Stat1, aa 465­585 for Stat3) connects the DNA-binding domain with the SH2/ dimerization domain (Fig. 3). The Stat1 crystal structure reveals that helix a10 of the linker domain interacts with

the SH2 domain (i.e. below the phosphate binding loop), and that helix a6 interacts with strand b11 of the DNA binding domain (Chen et al., 1998). These observations suggest that DNA binding capacity can be regulated by structural changes in the SH2 domain as it binds phosphotyrosine. Mutational studies have also implicated the linker domain of Stat1 in transcriptional regulation (Yang et al., 1999). 3.1.5. SH2 domain and tyrosine activation motif SH2 domains play an important role in signaling through their capacity to bind to specific phosphotyrosine motifs. Consistent with this, it is the most highly conserved STAT domain. Moreover, the SH2 domain of the Dictyostelium STAT appears to represent one of the `earliest' identified SH2 domains (Kawata et al., 1997). Although the sequence of the STAT SH2 domain (,residues 580­680) is quite divergent from other SH2 domains, its structure is well conserved. It consists of an anti-parallel b-sheet flanked by two a-helices, which form a pocket. An absolutely conserved arginine, which mediates the interaction with phosphate, lies at the base of this pocket (Arg-602 for Stat1, Arg-609 for Stat3). The ability of this SH2 domain to recognize specific phosphotyrosine motifs plays an essential role in three STAT signaling events: (1) recruitment to the cytokine receptor through recognition of specific receptor phosphotyrosine motifs (see Table 2); (2) association with the activating JAK (Gupta et al., 1996; BarahmandPour et al., 1998); and (3) STAT homo- or heterodimerization (Shuai et al., 1994; Gupta et al., 1996). As highlighted in the crystal structures, STAT dimerization depends on the interaction between the SH2 domain of one STAT monomer and the tyrosine phosphorylated tail segment of the other monomer. Residues most involved in defining the specificity of the interaction between the SH2 domain and tyrosine motif are located at positions 11, 13 and 15, 16, 17 Cterminal to the phosphotyrosine (Chen et al., 1998). Closely positioned amino acids of the SH2 domain (e.g. Ala-641, Val-642) appear to participate in this interaction. All STATs except Stat2 have been shown to form stable homodimers in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, many STATs, including Stat2, can heterodimerize with other STATs through this reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction (Schindler et al., 1995; Darnell, 1997). 3.1.6. Transcriptional activation domain Consistent with its ability to regulate unique transcriptional responses, the carboxy-terminal domain is poorly conserved among the STATs. The first evidence that the carboxy-terminus encodes transcriptional activation domain (TAD) came from a comparative analysis of the full-length Stat1 and an alternatively spliced isoform Stat1b, which lacks the last 38 carboxy-terminal amino acids (Schindler et al., 1992). Well characterized C-terminally truncated isoforms have also been identified for Stat3, Stat4 and

(Farrar et al., 2000). However, these studies have not yet been confirmed in lymphocytes, where Stat4 is normally expressed. 3.2. Cytokine and growth factor receptors involved in STAT activation Structural studies of several hematopoietin receptors from the cytokine family indicate that ligand binding promotes the dimerization of receptors into an active conformation (Wells, 1996). In each case activation is believed to lead to close approximation of cytoplasmic receptor tails, enabling the transphosphorylation (i.e. activation) of the receptor-associated JAKs. Activated JAKs then phosphorylate specific tyrosine motifs present in the receptor endodomains, which in turn mediate the recruitment of STATs to their appropriate receptor. This entails the ability of STAT SH2 domains to recognize a phosphotyrosine residue and 4­5 carboxy-proximal amino acids, known as the receptor STAT recruitment motif. Both, the nature of the STATs recruited and structural similarities, divide the hematopoietin receptors into several related families. This topic has recently been reviewed (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000) and will therefore only be briefly summarized here. An emphasis will be placed on more recently identified receptors. Table 1 summarizes functional groups into which hematopoietin receptors can be divided and Table 2 summarizes known receptor STAT recruitment (tyrosine) motifs. 3.2.1. The Interferon/IL-10 receptor family Sequence comparisons have determined that the IFN and IL-10 receptors are both related to each other and the most divergent members of the hematopoietin family. Interferons can be divided into two functionally distinct classes, each of which binds to a unique receptor. Type I IFNs are comprised of IFN-as, IFN-b, INF-v and Limitin (Diaz et al., 1993; Oritani et al., 2000), which are produced by most cell types. Type II IFN only includes IFN-g (Bach et al., 1997). Both the type I and type II interferon receptors consist of two chains that heterodimerize (IFNaRI/IFNaRII and IFNgRI/ IFNgRII (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000)). The IL-10 receptor, which shows the highest structural similarity to the IFNg receptor, is also composed of two subunits (IL-10R1 and IL-10RII (Ho et al., 1993; Spencer et al., 1998)). Although the ability of each of these receptor families to activate STATs has been studied, the data for the IFN-g receptor is more widely accepted. 3.2.1.1. IFN-g receptor. IFN-g, like IFN-a, plays a key role in innate and acquired host immune responses (reviewed in Bach et al., 1997). It can inhibit viral and cellular proliferation, and regulate apoptosis. Unlike IFN-a, IFN-g function is required for host defenses against several intracellular pathogens. IFN-g is predominantly produced by activated T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells;

Stat5 (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). They appear to function as dominant-negative regulators. Although a detailed understanding of how the STAT carboxy-terminus regulates transcription remains to be determined, important progress has been made. For example, it has been determined that the transcriptional activity of several STATs can be modulated through serine phosphorylation (reviewed in Decker and Kovarik, 2000). Serine phosphorylation appears to enhance the transcription of some, but not all target genes. It has been suggested that serine phosphorylation may alter the affinity for other transcriptional regulators like MCM5, BRCA1, but not CBP/ p300 (see Section 4.2.1). Of note, the carboxy-terminus of Stat2 exhibits some unique features. It is not conserved between humans and mice. The murine sequence harbors a 16 nucleotide minisatellite insertion (Park et al., 1999; Farrar et al., 2000). Yet, these divergent sequences appear to be largely functionally interchangeable (Park et al., 1999). It has been suggested that these differences may account for the unique ability of IFN-a to activate Stat4 in human, but not murine T cells

however, its receptor is expressed on most cells. Cellular responses following IFN-g stimulation are mediated through the recruitment of Stat1 to a single Stat1 binding site in the IFNgRI chain and its subsequent activation by Jak1/Jak2 (Greenlund et al., 1994). Both IFN-g receptor chains participate in signal transduction, as demonstrated by targeted disruption of the two chains (Huang et al., 1993; Lu et al., 1998). 3.2.1.2. IFN-a receptor. IFN-a and IFN-b, which represent the prototypical type I interferons, play a key role in innate and early host responses to viral infection (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). The IFN-a receptor associates with Jak1 and Tyk2 to mediate IFN dependent gene transcription. This entails the activation of two distinct STAT dependent signaling pathways, ISGF-3 and Stat1 homodimers. ISGF3 is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of Stat1, Stat2 and p48/IRF-9. Stat3 homodimers and Stat1/Stat3 heterodimers have also been reported to be activated by type I interferons, but their role in signaling remains to be elucidated. 3.2.1.3. IL-10 receptor and IL-10 related receptors. IL-10 plays an important role in the downregulation of inflammatory responses. It is produced by the Th2 subpopulation of T helper cells and modulates a variety of immune cell functions, particularly those of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (reviewed in Moore et al., 2001). The IL-10 receptor signals through sequential activation of Tyk2/Jak1 and Stat1/Stat3. Recently, the receptor complex for IL-22/IL-TIF, an IL10 homolog, has been identified (Dumoutier et al., 2000; Xie et al., 2000). This receptor consists of an IL-10RII and IL-22/CRF2-9R subunit, a novel member of the interferon receptor family. Similar to IL-10, IL-22 can induce Stat1 and Stat3 (Dumoutier et al., 2000). Both receptor chains seem to be required for STAT activation (Xie et al., 2000). The IL-22R subunit contains potential Stat3 recruitment sites (YXXQ). Functionally, IL-22 has been shown to increase production of acute-phase reactants in HepG2 cells and inhibit IL-4 production in Th2-polarized human T cells (Dumoutier et al., 2000; Xie et al., 2000). IL-20 is another IL-10 homolog, but in contrast to IL-22, it employs two receptor chains that are structurally not related to the IL-10R (i.e. IL-20Ra and IL-20Rb). However, heterodimerization with other class II cytokine receptors cannot be excluded given that only IL-20Ra seems to be expressed in some tissues. Yet, like IL-10, IL-20 appears to signal through Stat3 (Blumberg et al., 2001). Localization and transgenic IL-20 overexpression studies implicate this ligand in epidermal function (Blumberg et al., 2001). Finally, there are a number of IL-10 related receptor genes, whose function and capacity to signal through Stat3 has not been documented. These include the receptors for IL-19, AK155, and mda-7 (Gallagher et al., 2000; Moore et al., 2001).

3.2.2. Gp130 receptor family Members of the gp130 receptor family can be divided into two subsets. One includes receptors for IL-6, IL-11, LIF, CT-1, OSM, CTNF and NNT-1/BSF-3, which share a common 130 kDa receptor glycoprotein subunit (Senaldi et al., 1999; Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). This shared receptor chain associates with ligand specific subunits (i.e. achains) to form functionally specific receptors that transduce signals predominantly through Stat3 (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). The gp130 receptor contains four STAT recruitment motifs, which differ in their affinity for Stat1 and/or Stat3 (Gerhartz et al., 1996). These motifs are quite modular and function well in chimeric receptor constructs. Recent gp130 knockout studies have confirmed the role these tyrosine motifs play in activation of Stat3 and the SHP2-MAP kinase signaling pathway (Ohtani et al., 2000). Receptors for G-CSF, Leptin and IL-12 belong to the second group of gp130 receptors, which are characterized by the employment of at least one gp130-like receptor chain. While Leptin and G-CSF signal through Stat3, IL12-induced gene expression is mediated through Stat4 activation (Kaplan et al., 1996b; Rosenblum et al., 1996; Thierfelder et al., 1996; McLemore et al., 2001). Of note, IL-12 is composed of disulfide-linked 35 and 40 kDa subunits (Gately et al., 1998). The 35 kDa subunit has homology to IL-6, while the 40 kDa subunit has homology to the a-chain of the IL-6 receptor. The 40 kDa subunit can also be linked to a 19 kDa subunit to form a novel cytokine, IL-23. IL-23 binds to a receptor consisting of the IL-12 receptor b1-chain and presumably a unique chain(s), which has/have not yet been identified. Like IL-12, it signals through Stat4 and promotes IFN-g production in PHA blast T cells. However, IL-23 uniquely induces proliferation of memory T cells (Oppmann et al., 2000).

3.2.3. IL-2 receptor family Receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, TSLP, IL-9, IL-13, IL-15 and IL-21 constitute the IL-2 receptor family (reviewed in Schindler and Strehlow, 2000; Vosshenrich and Di Santo, 2001). Each of these receptors is composed of at least one specific ligand binding chain (usually referred to as the achain) and a shared receptor component, the common gamma chain (gC). Some receptors (e.g. for IL-2 and IL15) include a third chain. The receptors for IL-13 and TSLP are unique in that they share receptor chains with members of this family, but do not include gC. The IL-13 receptor consists of the IL-4 receptor a-chain and an IL-13 specific ligand binding chain (Kawakami et al., 2001). TSLP binds to a receptor consisting of the IL-7 receptor a-chain and an unidentified receptor chain(s) (Pandey et al., 2000). While the receptors for IL-2, IL-7, TSLP, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 transmit signals through activation of Stat5, the receptors for IL-4 and IL-13 activate Stat6. Functionally, these receptors play an important role in lymphoid maturation and activation (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000).

3.2.4. IL-3 receptor family The IL-3 receptor family includes receptors for IL-3, IL5, and GM-CSF. These cytokines have been implicated in the maturation and activation of myeloid cells. Their receptors are characterized by a common signal-transducing bsubunit complexed with a ligand specific a-subunit (Miyajima et al., 1993). Signal transduction by these receptors is mediated through activation of Jak2 and Stat5 (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). 3.2.5. Single chain receptor family Receptors for GH (growth hormone), Epo (erythropoietin), PRL (prolactin) and Tpo (thrombopoietin) belong to the family of single chain receptors. Though functionally divergent, these receptors share two important features. First, they consist of one chain that homodimerizes upon ligand binding. Second, they signal through sequential activation of Jak2 and Stat5. Receptors for G-CSF and Leptin also belong to single chain receptor family. However, due to their structural and functional homology to the gp130 family they have been discussed earlier. 3.2.6. Non-cytokine receptors Non-cytokine receptors, like receptor tyrosine kinases (RTks) and G-protein-coupled receptors, have also been implicated in STAT activation (reviewed in Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). JAK/STAT signaling activated by EGF (epidermal growth factor) and PDGF (platelet derived growth factor), which signal through RTKs, has been studied extensively. Likewise, JAK/STAT signaling activated by Angiotensin II receptor (AT1), a G-protein-coupled receptor, has been well characterized (Marrero et al., 1995). Of note, activation of the putative STATs in Dictyostelium is mediated by a G-protein-coupled receptor (Aubry and Firtel, 1999). 3.3. Nucleocytoplasmic transport of STATs In unstimulated cells STATs predominantly localize to the cytoplasm, and upon stimulation rapidly translocate to the nucleus and induce gene expression. After termination of the signal, STATs translocate back to the cytoplasm. This regulated mobilization of STATs is an essential step for signaling and is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC (Doye and Hurt, 1997). Like all molecules larger than ,60 kDa, STATs are transported across the NPC in an active bidirectional process that is energy and activation dependent. This chapter will examine the regulation of both STAT nuclear import and export. 3.3.1. Nuclear import Active nuclear import of protein is directed by short amino acid sequence called a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The NLS is recognized and bound by members of the nuclear receptor family proteins, called importins. All NLS elements include a short stretch of basic amino acid

residues (i.e. arginines and lysines) that do not yield a clear consensus. Generally NLSs elements can be classified into two categories, monopartite (e.g. SV40 large T-antigen (Kalderon et al., 1984)) and bipartite (e.g. nucleoplasmin (Robbins et al., 1991)). The latter comprises two clusters of basic amino acid residues separated by a spacer that varies in length. Tripartite NLS elements have also recently been identified (Pokorska et al., 2000). Importins are members of a family of proteins called karyopherins (Moroianu et al., 1995). Importin-a recognizes the NLS and then functions as an adapter binding importin-b (Gorlich et al., 1994). Importin-b in turn interacts with the NPC and mediates the transport of cargo into the nucleus. Hydrolysis of GTP by Ran, a Ras-like small GTPase, provides the energy required to translocate cargo through the central gated channel of NPC (Moore and Blobel, 1993). The rapid and ligand dependent nuclear import of STATs was an important feature recognized during the initial characterization of Stat1 and Stat2. Moreover, this was found to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation and independent of an association with the cytoskeleton (Lillemeier et al., 2001). Subsequent studies with blocking antibodies or dominant negative mutants, determined that Ran plays an important role in the IFN-g dependent nuclear import of Stat1 (Sekimoto et al., 1996). However, the inability of NPI-1 specific antibodies to completely inhibit nuclear import of Stat1 suggested that additional Stat1 recognition factor(s) might participate in the nuclear import. Detailed NPI-1 mutagenesis experiments indicated that Stat1 interacted with a C-terminal domain of NPI-1, which does not appear to be involved in `classical NLS' recognition (Sekimoto et al., 1997). Likewise, the site in Stat1 and Stat3 recognized by NPI-1, i.e. the putative NLS, exhibits some unusual features. Although this interaction is dependent on activation of both Stat1 and Stat3 and, in Stat3 maps to the amino terminus, an NLS element(s) has not yet been identified (S. Bhattacharya, C. Schindler, unpublished observation). Several groups have attempted to locate the elusive STAT NLS through mutagenesis of arginine/lysine-rich motifs. Most of these mutants have not been informative (Sekimoto et al., 1997; Herrington et al., 1999; S. Bhattacharya, C. Schindler, unpublished data). However, recent studies have determined that mutagenesis of an arginine/lysinerich element located in the DNA-binding domain of Stat1 (Lys-410 to Arg-418) and Stat2 (Arg-409 to Lys-415), abrogated IFN-induced nuclear import (Melen et al., 2001). Disappointingly, this element is not conserved in Stat5a, Stat5b, and Stat6. Moreover, these mutants functioned as dominant negative molecules, inhibiting the IFN dependent nuclear import of endogenous STATs. This suggested that two arginine/lysine-rich elements, one in each STAT monomer, are required for IFN-induced STAT nuclear import. Additionally, these mutants were incapable of binding to DNA (i.e. GAS or ISGF-3 elements), raising the possibility

10

T. Kisseleva et al. / Gene 285 (2002) 1­24

that their structure has been grossly perturbed. Thus, even though NLS elements often overlap with DNA binding domains, the potential for these elements in regulating STAT nuclear translocation should be considered as preliminary. Curiously, several (but not all) STAT DNA binding mutants have been found to exhibit defective nuclear import. The Stat1 EE428/429AS mutant resides in the cytoplasm of resting and stimulated cells. Surprisingly, LMB, an inhibitor of nuclear export, restored nuclear accumulation of this mutant (see below; McBride et al., 2000). The Stat5 DNA binding mutant at residues 466­469 (`VVVI') also failed to accumulate in the nucleus, but LMB sensitivity has not been evaluated (Herrington et al., 1999). A further confounding observation has been that amino terminal STAT mutants are also defective in nuclear import (S. Bhattacharya, C. Schindler, unpublished observation; Strehlow and Schindler, 1998; Haspel and Darnell, 1999). Finally, the identification of putative NLS elements in cytokine receptors and ligands led to the speculation that STATs may translocate to the nucleus through association with other signaling components (Subramaniam et al., 2000). However, there is little concrete data to support such a model. Thus, much work remains to be done on the regulation of STAT nuclear import.

3.3.2. Nuclear export Analogous to import, nuclear export is specified by nuclear export signals (NES), which are characterized by a leucine rich amino acid sequence (Fornerod et al., 1997). Comparison of the NES sequences has revealed a loose consensus motif of Lx1­3Lx2­3LxL, where L is leucine and x is any amino acid. Substitution of leucine by isoleucine, valine and methionine is permitted. Disruption of two of these hydrophobic residues is usually required to impair NES function. The export receptor CRM1, first identified as a tightly bound complex to NPC protein, interacts with the NES in a Ran-GTP dependent manner (Fornerod et al., 1997). A potent anti-fungal reagent, Leptomycin B (LMB), binds directly to CRM-1 and blocks its ability to associate with NES elements (Fornerod et al., 1997; Kudo et al., 1998). LMB, therefore, has become an important tool for studying CRM-1 dependent nuclear export. In contrast to the poorly understood mechanism of STAT nuclear import, recent studies on Stat1 have provided important insights into how this protein is exported from the nucleus during the period of signal decay that follows stimulation. Three NES elements (residues 195­205, 302­ 314 and 399­410) have been reported for Stat1 (Begitt et al., 2000; McBride et al., 2000; Mowen and David, 2000). NES elements 302­314 and 399­410 drive LMB-sensitive export, indicating that they are recognized by CRM1. However, LMB does not completely block Stat1 export (Begitt et al., 2000; McBride et al., 2000). Similar observations have also been made with Stat3 (S. Bhattacharya, C.

Schindler, unpublished data) and point to the existence of additional LMB insensitive export mechanism. A comparison of the NES elements found in Stat1 at 302­ 314 and 399­410 indicates that they are well conserved in the STAT family. The NES at 399­410 fits the consensus for NES elements, but the site at 302­314 is more divergent (Henderson and Eleftheriou, 2000). Genetic and biochemical studies have provided reasonably compelling evidence that the NES elements at 302­314 and 399­410 regulate STAT nuclear export ((Begitt et al., 2000; McBride et al., 2000; S. Bhattacharya, C. Schindler, unpublished observation). However, the role for the divergent element at 195­ 202, which only functions in Jak1 null cells, remains controversial (Mowen and David, 2000). The crystal structure of Stat1 indicates that the NES at position 302­314 is only partially exposed. Of the two functionally critical leucine residues, the one at position 308 is exposed and the other at position 312 is buried. However, only a double mutation, LL308/312AA, decreases Stat1 export. This raises the possibility that the exposure of this element may be more significant in non-activated Stat1 or activated Stat1 not bound to DNA. Of note, this mutation does not affect the predominantly cytoplasmic distribution of Stat1 in resting cells, but significantly decreases the rapid export seen in post-stimulated cells. It is therefore, likely that this NES may be involved in the export of activated Stat1 that is not bound to DNA. The NES at 399­410 resides in the DNA binding domain and appears to be buried in the DNA bound activated form of Stat1. Thus, the side chains of the key hydrophobic residues do not appear to be solvent accessible. The authors argue that DNA binding may serve to down regulate the activity of this NES element. Consistent with this model, placing the 399­410 NES to an exposed carboxy-terminal location leads to a constitutively exported mutant (McBride et al., 2000). The Stat1 DNA binding mutant, EE428/ 429AS, is localized to the cytoplasm after stimulation, but with LMB pretreatment it accumulates in the nucleus of stimulated cells. This suggests that the NES at 399­410 is most important for post-stimulation export (McBride et al., 2000). Studies with these mutants have also highlighted the role of nuclear phosphatases in regulation of STAT export and signal decay. Recent studies on Stat3 have provided additional insight into the nuclear export of STATs. First, the elements at 302­314 and 399­410 are conserved in Stat3 (306­318 and 404­401, respectively). In addition, longer treatment with LMB (e.g. 8 h) leads to the nuclear accumulation of Stat3 in resting cells. Similar results have been obtained with cells expressing Stat3 Y705F and suggest that non-activated Stat3 is continuously exported from the nucleus (S. Bhattacharya, C. Schindler, unpublished observation). Analysis of Stat3 sequence has also identified another potential conserved NES element between residues 524­537 (S. Bhattacharya, C. Schindler, unpublished observation). Moreover, mutation of this NES promotes nuclear accumulation in both resting and stimulated cells in a LMB

11

sensitive manner. This suggests that the element at 524­537 is responsible for basal export. Similar observations were made with mutation of the Stat3 NES at 404­414, indicating that it also regulates the basal distribution of Stat3. Mutation of the element at 306­318 revealed a defect in post-stimulation nuclear export, as had been observed with Stat1. The observations suggest that multiple STAT NES elements serve to regulate both basal and post-stimulation export. Studies on a primitive STAT, DdStat-a, found in Dictyostelium has also reported to contain a Crm1 dependent NES (Ginger et al., 2000). The activity of this NES is regulated by serine phosphorylation (via GskA, a homologue of glycogen synthase kinase-3). However, the two putative NES elements specified in the region responsible for CRM1 dependent export (DdStat-a, 288­444 amino acid) do not appear to be conserved with mammalian STATs. This raises intriguing evolutionary questions. In summary, more recent progress has been made in understanding how STATs are exported from the nucleus, then imported. Unexpectedly, these studies indicate that in resting cells STATs are continuously exported from the nucleus, raising some intriguing new questions about STAT regulation. 3.4. STAT DNA binding sites Investigation of IFN responses has identified two different transcriptional enhancers within the promoter elements of STAT target genes (Kessler et al., 1988; Decker et al., 1997; Schindler and Brutsaert, 1999). Type I IFNs (a, b, v, Limitin) signal through the formation of ISGF-3 complexes, which bind to ISRE sites (IFN stimulated response elements) and initiate gene transcription (Kessler et al., 1988). Comparative analysis of IFN-a response elements revealed an ISRE consensus consisting of two tandem sequences, AGTTTN3TTTCC. Among the proteins that compose the ISGF-3 complex, IRF-9/p48 plays a critical role in recognizing the ISRE site. Stat1 also promotes contact with the additional flanking nucleotides, whereas Stat2 does not directly interact with the DNA (Qureshi et al., 1995). IFN type II signals (g) through Stat1 homodimers, which bind to a distinct response element, the GAS (Decker et al., 1997). This palindromic element has a consensus sequence of TTTCCNGGAAA. Similar responsive elements have been identified in the promoters of other STAT-induced genes. Biochemical studies have determined that TTCN2­ 4GAA consensus defines the optimal binding site for all STATs, with an exception of Stat2, which appears to be defective in DNA binding. This provides an opportunity for most STAT homodimers to exhibit unique DNA binding preferences. In part this is determined by spacing between palindromic half sites. Thus, Stat1 binds to an element with a canonical n ¼ 3 spacing, while Stat3 and Stat6 favor elements where n ¼ 2 and n ¼ 4, respectively (Decker et al., 1997; Ehret et al., 2001). Additionally, recent studies

indicate that the ability of STATs to bind cooperatively to tandem GAS elements (6­10 bp apart) also contributes to DNA binding specificity. Moreover, these tandem sites often include nonconsensus GAS elements (Soldaini et al., 2000; Ehret et al., 2001). 3.5. Members of STAT family In contrast to their more important developmental role in primitive eukaryotes, gene-targeting studies indicate that STATs largely evolved to mediate host responses to stress in mammals (reviewed in Schindler and Strehlow, 2000; Ihle, 2001). Moreover, these studies highlighted a remarkable level of specificity in STAT function. For example, Stat1 and Stat2 predominately transduce signals for type I and type II IFNs. Likewise, Stat4 and Stat6 play an important role in the polarization of naive T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. However, Stat3 and Stat5, which are activated by more cytokines, are more pleiotropic in their function. Consistent with this, they appear to be more closely related to the STATs found in lower eukaryotes. 3.5.1. Evolution STATs are well conserved during eukaryotic evolution and may encode the primordial SH2 domain. Homologues have been identified in Dictyostelium, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, Anopheles, Xenopus and zebrafish (Aubry and Firtel, 1999; Barillas-Mury et al., 1999; Oates et al., 1999; Zeidler et al., 2000; Pascal et al., 2001). In Drosophila, the JAK/STAT pathway is genetically well characterized and has been shown to be important for larval hematopoiesis, sexual identity, embryo segmentation and the formation of polarity in the eye (reviewed in Zeidler et al., 2000). The single Drosophila JAK exhibits 27% identity to Jak2 and the single STAT 37% identity to Stat5. There are homologues of a cytokine receptor, (Upd), and ligand, (Dom), as well (Harrison et al., 1998; Strodicke et al., 2000). Of note, several regulatory proteins associated with mammalian JAK/STAT signaling, including SOCS, PIAS and STAM, are also conserved in Drosophila (reviewed in Zeidler et al., 2000; see Section 4.1). The STAT homologues in Dictyostelium are also most closely related to mammalian Stat5 and Stat3 (15­19% of identity). Although, they play an important role in development of the multicellular stage of Dictyostelium, this signaling pathway is unrelated to the one found in Drosophila and vertebrates (reviewed in Aubry and Firtel, 1999). Recently, two STATlike sequences, that exhibit a similarly modest level of homology to mammalian homologues (17 and 27% identity), have been identified in C. elegans (Ruvkun and Hobert, 1998; Liu et al., 1999). As in the case with Dictyostelium, no cytokine receptor or JAK homologues have been found in C. elegans. In contrast, Zebrafish encodes two STATs, homologous to Stat1 and Stat3. The Stat3 homologue is expressed early in development and is syntenic with

12

murine and human Stat3. The Stat1 homologue is more divergent and expressed later in life (Oates et al., 1999). In mammals, the seven STATs are segregated to three clusters. Each cluster represents a tandem duplication. Stat1 and Stat4 map to chromosome 1, while Stat2 and Stat6 cosegregate on chromosome 10. Stat3 and Stat5 are located on chromosome 11, but the Stat5 gene has undergone an additional duplication (i.e. Stat5a and Stat5b) more recently in evolutionary history (Copeland et al., 1995). Consistent with this, analysis of the Stat3 and Stat5 gene structure suggest that these two STATs may have been the first mammalian STATs (Miyoshi et al., 2001). This may also account for the relative functional pleiotropy of these two STATs. 3.5.2. Stat1 Investigation into IFNs signaling pathways led to the discovery of Stat1 and Stat2, the first members of STAT family. IFN-g activates Stat1 homodimers, which initiate transcription of GAS-driven genes. IFN-a and IFN-b (i.e. type I IFNs) induce formation of Stat1 homodimers and Stat1/Stat2 heterodimers. The latter complex associates with p48 and induce transcription of ISRE-driven genes. The generation of Stat1 knockout mouse confirmed the primary involvement of Stat1 in IFN signaling (Durbin et al., 1996; Meraz et al., 1996). These mice were defective in IFN dependent immune response to both viral and microbial agents. Biochemical studies demonstrated that these mice failed to induce transcription of Stat1 target genes in response to both IFN-a and IFN-g. They also failed to induce ISGF-3 target genes in response to IFN-a. Over the last several years Stat1 null mice have been exploited to demonstrate the wide role IFN-g (and IFN-a) plays in regulating innate and acquired immunity (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). This includes recent studies highlighting the role IFN-g plays in protecting mice from chemically induced and spontaneous tumors. Stat1 and IFN-g deficient animals develop chemically-induced tumors more rapidly and more frequently than wild-type mice. Moreover, RAG2/Stat1 double knockout mice (RkSk mice) develop spontaneous cancer at a considerably higher frequency then RAG2 2 /2 mice. These observations provide compelling evidence for an IFN-g/Stat1 dependent tumor immune surveillance system in immune competent hosts (Shankaran et al., 2001). Studies in Stat1 null mice have also provided evidence for non-immune role for Stat1. For example, even though Stat1 2 /2 mice do not exhibit obvious skeletal defects, Stat1 deficient embryos have impaired FGF dependent chondrocyte proliferation (Sahni et al., 1999). Other studies have suggested that Stat1 affects apoptosis through the regulation of caspases (Chin et al., 1997). Moreover, these studies suggest that `inactive' Stat1 (i.e. Stat1 Y701F) protects cells from apoptosis (Kumar et al., 1997). The identification of low levels of Stat1 in the nucleus of unstimulated cells, suggests that Stat1 might cooperate with other transcrip-

tional factors to regulate the basal expression of genes that regulate apoptosis (reviewed in Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). 3.5.3. Stat2 Stat2 represents a unique member of STAT family. It is the only Stat that is not known to bind GAS elements following activation. Additionally, human Stat2 is quite divergent from murine Stat2. Both proteins share 78% similarity, but differ significantly in their carboxy-terminal TAD domain (Park et al., 1999). While the biological relevance of this divergence is not fully understood, it is clear that both mouse and human Stat2 are activated by type I IFNs and play a critical role in promoting the antiviral immune response. Biochemical studies implicating Stat2 in type I IFN signaling have been confirmed with Stat2 knockout mice (Park et al., 2000). Additional studies in Stat2 null mice indicate that a Stat2/IFN-a autocrine loop regulates the basal level of Stat1 expression in primary embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), but not in macrophages. Stat1 dependent expression of GAS-driven genes in response to IFN-a is also defective in Stat2 null fibroblasts, but not in Stat2 null macrophages. However, the normal IFN-g/Stat1 dependent activation of GAS-driven genes in all Stat2 null tissues suggests that the MEF specific IFN-a defect may not represent a threshold phenomenon. Stat1/Stat2 double knockout mice, which are completely unresponsive to both classes of IFNs, have also been generated and exhibit more susceptibility to infection than either single knockout mice. This raises the possibility that Stat2 may transduce some signals, independent of Stat1. The identification of Stat2/Stat2/p48 complex in Stat1 deficient cells supports the existence of an alternative Stat2 pathway (Bluyssen and Levy, 1997). In contrast to the detailed understanding of how Stat1 is recruited to the IFN-g receptor recruitment to the IFN-a receptor remain controversial. For example, the receptor tyrosines that have been proposed to recruit Stat2 to the IFN-a receptor, are not conserved between man and mouse. Likewise, studies in Stat2 deficient human and murine fibroblasts suggest IFN-a induced Stat1 activation is dependent on Stat2. A sequential Stat2-Stat1 recruitment model has been proposed (Leung et al., 1996). Yet, in Stat2 null macrophages, IFN-a dependent activation of Stat1 is normal (Park et al., 2000). Additionally, it has recently been suggested that the divergence in Stat2 carboxy-terminal sequences accounts for the unique ability of IFN-a to activate Th1 cells in humans, but not in mice (Farrar et al., 2000). Yet, preliminary studies in Stat2 deficient lymphocytes fail to support this model (Lee and Schindler, unpublished observation). Thus, despite being the second STAT cloned, Stat2 remains one of the least well understood. 3.5.4. Stat4 Stat4 was initially identified through screens for STAT

homologues (reviewed in Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). In contrast to all other STATs, the expression of Stat4 was found to be limited to NK cells, dendritic cells and T lymphocytes. Subsequent studies determined that Stat4 was activated by IL-12, which plays a critical role in the development of the Th1 subset of T helper cells (versus Th2 cells; see Section 3.5.5 below). One important manifestation of this IL-12 dependent Th1 polarization is the secretion of IFN-g. Likewise, IL-12 also induces the expression of IFNg in NK cells (Murphy et al., 2000a). Characterization of Stat4 knockout mice confirmed the critical role Stat4 plays in IL-12 signaling (Kaplan et al., 1996b; Thierfelder et al., 1996). As was the case in the IL-12 deficient mice (Gately et al., 1998), Stat4 2 /2 lymphocytes failed to differentiate into Th1 cells and produce IFN-g in response to IL-12. Moreover, Stat4 null T cells exhibited an exuberant tendency towards Th2 polarization, reflecting the ability of Th1 cells to antagonize the development of Th2 cells. Intriguingly, with sufficiently strong Th1 polarizing condition it is possible to generate Stat4 null Th1 cells (Kaplan et al., 1998). In humans, but not in mice, Stat4 has also been shown to be activated by type I IFNs. Consistent with this, human type I IFNs have also been shown to drive T cell polarization toward Th1 cells (Rogge et al., 1998). This speciesspecific IFN-a dependent Stat4 activation has recently been attributed to the divergence between human and murine Stat2 (Park et al., 1999; Farrar et al., 2000). Specifically, a model in which Stat2 serves as a scaffold to recruit Stat4 to the human type I IFN receptor has been proposed (Farrar et al., 2000). However, this model has not been evaluated in cells that express Stat4 endogenously, and other models could be considered. For example, expression of IRF-1, which is required for normal Th1 polarization, can be stimulated both in a Stat4 dependent manner or IFN-a (i.e. ISGF-3) dependent manner (Galon et al., 1999). Thus, a differential regulation of IRF-1 in humans versus mice could also account for this dichotomy. Consistent with this, in mice IRF-1 has been determined to be a Stat4 target gene and IRF-1 knockout mice are impaired in their Th1 responses (reviewed in Wurster et al., 2000). In summary, Stat4 appears to transduce signals exclusively for IL-12. It therefore plays a critical role in the development of Th1 cells. However, the Stat4 target genes that mediate this important event remain to be elucidated. 3.5.5. Stat6 Stat6, which is expressed in all tissues, was originally purified from the cell extracts as the IL-4 stimulated STAT (Hou et al., 1994). It was subsequently shown to be also activated by IL-13, which shares a receptor chain with IL-4 (Lin et al., 1995). Although IL-4 stimulates Stat6 activation, several additional pathways are stimulated. Some of these are dependent on the IRS-2 adapter protein (Ryan et al., 1996). IL-4 and IL-13 play an important role in regulating

acquired immunity. IL-4 is secreted by activated T and B lymphocytes, mast cells and basophils and promotes the activation of several cell types, most notably Th2 cells. Another important target of IL-4 is B cell where it promotes differentiation and secretion of IgE and IgG1 (reviewed in Paul, 1997). Other cytokines have also been reported to activate Stat6, but the significance of these observations remains to be determined. Generation of Stat6 knockout mice has provided an opportunity to more rigorously test the role of Stat6 in immune response. These mice exhibit a profound defects in their ability to develop Th2 cells (Kaplan et al., 1996a; Shimoda et al., 1996; Takeda et al., 1996). This defect is more pronounced in Stat6 2 /2 mice than the IL-4 2 /2 mice, due to the additional loss of IL-13 signaling. IL-4 stimulated Stat6 knockout tissues also fail to upregulate expression of MHC class II, the IL-4R, the low affinity IgE receptor. These mice are also defective in the ability to class switch to IgE. Intriguingly, IL-4 dependent proliferation of Stat6 deficient lymphocytes was almost completely abrogated despite normal IRS-2 activation (Kaplan et al., 1996a). More recent studies have begun to focus on how Stat6 may regulate Th2 development. These studies suggest that Stat6 may regulate the expression of GATA-3 and c-maf, two transcription factors important for Th2 function (Ouyang et al., 1998). Stat6 also initiates a significant chromatin remodeling at the IL-4 gene locus, suggesting a role in the regulation of IL-4 expression (Agarwal and Rao, 1998). Other recent studies have focused on the potential role of Bcl-6 in antagonizing Stat6 signaling in B cells (Dent et al., 1997; Ye et al., 1997). Clearly, the identification of additional Stat6-driven genes is likely to provide a further insight into Th2 development and function. 3.5.6. Stat3 Stat3 was originally identified as an acute-phase response factor, activated by IL-6. It is also activated by other cytokines as outlined in Section 3.2 and Table 1 (Akira et al., 1994). Stat3 has more recently also attained notoriety for its involvement in transformation. Not only has Stat3 been determined to be constitutively active in a growing number of murine and human tumors, but Stat3 has also been shown to regulate Src dependent transformation of fibroblasts (reviewed in Bowman et al., 2000). Several studies have suggested that c-myc, Bcl-XL and Fas are important Stat3 target genes involved in transformation. Highlighting the potential of Stat3 to promote cell growth, a constitutively activated mutant of Stat3 has been shown to potentate tumorigenesis (Bromberg et al., 1999). These observations have recently drawn an increasing interest to understanding how Stat3 regulates cell growth. Stat3 is expressed in most tissues and early during postimplantation. Consistent with this, disruption of Stat3 gene leads to an early embryonic lethal phenotype (Takeda et al., 1997). Stat3 2 /2 embryos developed normally to the egg

14

cylinder stage (E6.5), but devoid of mesoderm, rapidly regressed and died around the day E7.5. This early lethal phenotype initially limited the ability to evaluate the role of Stat3 in specific signaling pathways. However, with the generation of mice with a `floxed' Stat3 allele, it has became possible to generate tissue specific knockouts. Stat3 deficient T cells exhibited the loss of proliferative response to IL-6, which has previously been shown to suppress apoptosis in these cells (Takeda et al., 1998). Stat3 deleted macrophages (and neutrophils), have highlighted the important role Stat3 plays in IL-10 signaling and downregulation of immune response (Takeda et al., 1999). These mice are exquisitely sensitive to LPS, polarization toward Th1 cells and develop chronic enterocolitis as adults. Stat3 null mammary glands exhibit a significant delay in programmed cell death that occurs during cyclical mammary gland involution (Chapman et al., 1999). Mice with Stat3 deficient hepatocytes exhibit defects in their ability to induce acutephase response genes (e.g. SAP, FB, HP, SAA and Hpx) in response to IL-6 (Alonzi et al., 2001). Yet, these genes are still induced by corticosteroids, another potent inducer of acute-phase genes. Finally, a tissue specific deletion of Stat3 in keratinocytes has yielded the most surprising results. These mice developed defects in both skin and hair (Sano et al., 1999). The skin pathology entailed acantosis (hyperplasia of the epidermis), hyperkeratosis and scaling. In vivo studies on primary Stat3 null keratinocytes have highlighted defective responses to EGF, HGF, TGF-a and IL-6 in wound healing assays. Of note, IL-20, which also signals through Stat3 and regulates keratinocytes growth, was not evaluated (Blumberg et al., 2001). The hair phenotype has been even more intriguing. These mice exhibited normal primary (i.e. in utero) hair growth, but had significant defects in second hair growth (e.g. postnatal day 11). More detailed studies suggest that regulation of spontaneous hair growth is under control of Stat3 (Sano et al., 2000). 3.5.7. Stat5 Stat5 (Stat5a) was first identified as a prolactin-induced transcription factor. Both biochemical studies, directed to identifying an IL-3-induced transcription factor, and cDNA screens, led to a discovery of two closely related sequences, Stat5a and Stat5b (Azam et al., 1995; Mui et al., 1995). These proteins were found to be encoded by two linked genes, Stat5a and Stat5b, which shared 96% identity and only diverged at their carboxy termini (reviewed in Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). Subsequent studies have shown that both Stat5 proteins are expressed in all tissues. In addition to prolactin (PRL), Stat5 proteins are activated by the IL-3 family (IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF), the IL-2 family (IL2, IL-7, TSLP, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21), growth hormone (GH), Epo and Tpo (Arnould et al., 1999; Schindler and Strehlow, 2000; Asao et al., 2001). In vitro studies with dominant negative Stat5 mutants have demonstrated that Stat5a and Stat5b display functional

redundancy (Moriggl et al., 1996). Despite these structural and functional similarities, Stat5a and Stat5b single knockout mice had remarkably distinct phenotypes, and the Stat5a/b double knockout mouse exhibited a combined phenotype. Stat5a single knockout mice were predominately defective in PRL dependent mammary gland development (Liu et al., 1997; Teglund et al., 1998). The Stat5a/b double knockout mice exhibited a more severe phenotype. Reminiscent of PRL receptor knockout mice, they were both infertile and defective in mammary gland development, suggesting that Stat5b can partially compensate the loss of Stat5a (Ormandy et al., 1997; Teglund et al., 1998). Stat5b single knockout mice exhibited defects similar to GH receptor deficient mice (Udy et al., 1997; Teglund et al., 1998). Since Stat5b is predominately activated by the high pulsatile levels of GH found in males (Waxman et al., 1995), females were largely unaffected. Stat5b null males were smaller (i.e. female sized), exhibited a loss in the expression of male-specific liver genes (e.g. MUP, CYP2D9), and an increased expression of female-specific liver genes like CYP3A. Again the defects were more pronounced in Stat5a/b double knockout mice. Moreover, with age these mice developed a dramatic loss in body weight (up to 40% vs. normal). Further analysis has suggested that Stat5a may prevent this lipolysis (Fain et al., 1999). The most unexpected phenotype in the Stat5a/b double knockout mice was their relatively normal peripheral blood counts (Teglund et al., 1998). Previous biochemical studies had implicated Stat5 in the signal transduction for numerous cytokines involved in hematopoiesis (see Table 1). More careful analysis, however, identified important defects in the development of myeloid and lymphoid lineages. These defects were really only apparent under conditions of increased stress to the system. For example, Stat5a/b deficient bone marrow cells revealed an impaired lineage specific expansion to IL-3, IL-5, IL-7, G-CSF, Tpo and GM-CSF (Teglund et al., 1998). Consistent with this, recent studies have suggested that GM-CSF-induced myeloid development correlates with an obligatory Stat5 protein processing event (Piazza et al., 2000; see also Section 4.1.5). Controversial studies have shown that the rapid expansion of the red blood cell pool seen during mid-gestation is defective in Stat5a/b double knockout mice (Socolovsky et al., 1999; Ihle, 2001). Further analysis suggested that Stat5 promoted the survival of erythroid precursors through an upregulation in Bcl-XL expression. Contradicting this finding however is a recent report indicating the Bcl-XL expression is normal in fetal liver cells harvested from Stat5a/b double knockout mice (Ihle, 2001). Stat5a/b double knockout mice have also been shown to exhibit defects in the rapid expansion of macrophages in inflammatory exudates (Kieslinger et al., 2000). This defect has also been correlated with a loss in Bcl-XL expression. Intriguingly, these exudates exhibited a relative increase in granulocyte content, suggesting Stat5 may also more directly regulate some differentiation programs.

Careful analysis of the lymphocytes from Stat5a/b double knockout mice also revealed important deficits. T cells exhibited a profound defect in their ability to proliferate to IL-2, analogous to what was observed in the IL-2 receptor b-chain null mice (Suzuki et al., 1995; Moriggl et al., 1999). Analysis of the peripheral cells revealed an abnormally large population of chronically activated T cells, again similar to the IL-2 receptor b-chain null mice (Suzuki et al., 1995). This has recently been attributed to a defect in antigen induced cell death (ACID), which is IL-2 and not IL-15 dependent (Van Parijs et al., 1999; Waldmann et al., 2001). In contrast, B cell precursors in Stat5a/b double knockout mice were reduced in number due to an inability to proliferate to IL-7 (Sexl et al., 2000). Of note, NK cells were absent in the Stat5a/b double knockout mice (Teglund et al., 1998). Mice deficient in both the Stat5a/b genes have also provided an opportunity to evaluate the potential role of Stat5 in the development of hematopoietic tumors, including those attributed to the TEL-Jak2 and v-Abl/BCR-Abl oncogenes. Previous studies have documented a striking prevalence of constitutively activated Stat5 in these tumors (reviewed in Bowman et al., 2000; Coffer et al., 2000). Moreover, constitutively activated mutants of Stat5 have been found to transform Ba/F3 cells in a Pim1 and Bcl-XL (two Stat5 target genes) dependent manner (Nosaka et al., 1999; Ariyoshi et al., 2000). Unexpectedly, when Stat5a/b deficient bone marrow derived B cells were infected with an Abelson transforming virus, tumors developed at the normal rate. This indicated that Stat5 was not required for v-Abl (or BCR-Abl) dependent tumorigenesis (Sexl et al., 2000). This contrasted the results obtained with TEL-Jak2 oncogene (Schwaller et al., 2000). Both myeloid and lymphoid transformation is substantially reduced in Stat5a/b null background. Moreover, transformation in the myeloid lineage could be fully substituted by expression of OSM, a Stat5 target gene, strongly implicating OSM in pathogenesis of this disease. This provides an intriguing link with Stat3, which is activated by OSM (see Table 1). 4. Regulation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway The JAK/STAT pathway is important for many host responses including defense, differentiation, proliferation, and oncogenesis. It is, therefore, not surprising that numerous regulatory layers exist to modulate this signaling pathway. This includes both negative and positive regulation. The effect of these regulatory processes determines the rate at which STAT signals are transduced. 4.1. Negative regulation of STAT signaling Although earlier studies focused on STAT activation, the transient nature of these signals suggested that signal decay would also be regulated. In fact, more recent studies have determined that STAT signals are downregulated at several

points in the signaling cascade including the receptors, JAKs and the STAT molecules themselves. 4.1.1. Receptors Cells commonly use several mechanisms to protect their receptors from prolonged activation. This includes the generation of soluble receptors, which compete for limiting quantities of ligands. These isoforms are generated either by proteolysis or alternate RNA splicing. A more common mechanism of downregulation entails receptor endocytosis. Consistent with this, a conserved ten-amino-acid motif that regulates endocytosis has been identified within the intracellular domain of gp130 (Dittrich et al., 1996). 4.1.2. Targeted degradation Ubiquitin-proteosome dependent degradation may also play a role in the downregulation of cytokine signaling. Proteosome inhibitors have been found to impede the degradation of both Stat1 and the IFN-g receptors in stimulated cells (Haspel et al., 1996; Kim and Maniatis, 1996). More recent studies have determined that proteosome inhibitors significantly stabilize the tyrosine phosphorylated isoforms of Stat4, Stat5 and Stat6, but have little effect on Stat1, Stat2 and Stat3. Moreover, these studies have identified a carboxy-terminal domain in Stat5 that promotes degradation (Wang et al., 2000). Proteosome inhibitors have also been shown to prolong JAK activity (Yu and Burakoff, 1997; Callus and Mathey-Prevot, 2000). However, the overall significance of targeted degradation on STAT signaling remains controversial (Lee et al., 1997; Melen et al., 2001) 4.1.3. JAK dephosphorylation JAK activation is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation (see Section 2.2.3). It is, therefore, not surprising that two related SH2 containing phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, have been found to negatively regulate JAK activity. Of note, SHP1 expression is largely restricted to hematopoietic tissues, while SHP2 is more widely expressed (Yi et al., 1993; Jiao et al., 1997). Loss of the receptor tyrosine motifs that recruit SHP1 to the Epo receptor prolongs JAK activity and signaling (Klingmuller et al., 1995). Moreover, a naturally occurring mutation at this site leads to a form of familial erythrocytosis (Chapelle et al., 1993). Similar observations have been made for the common b-chain, which transduces signals for IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF (Yi et al., 1993. Likewise, studies in which the gp130 receptor has been mutated through a `knock-in' approach have determined that a loss in the ability to recruit and activate SHP2 significantly prolongs Stat3 signaling (Ohtani et al., 2000). Other studies have suggested that SHP1 and SHP2 directly interact with and dephosphorylate JAKs and Stat5 respectively (Yi et al., 1993; Yu et al., 2000). Additionally, recent studies have indicated that the well-characterized membrane-spanning phosphatase, CD45, negatively regulates JAK-STAT signaling stimulated by IL-3, IL-4, EPO and IFN-g (Irie-Sasaki et al., 2001). These observations

16

indicate that phosphatases play an important role in negatively regulating STAT dependent signaling. 4.1.4. Negative feedback loops The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are a family of STAT target genes that directly antagonize STAT activation, thus establishing an important and classic `feedback loop'. Since there are a number of excellent reviews on this family, only highlights will be presented in this section (Nicola et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2000; Kile et al., 2001). CIS-1 (cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein) was the founding member of this family (Yoshimura et al., 1995). Overexpression studies suggested that CIS blocked STAT receptor recruitment, but CIS knockout mice have not exhibited an obvious phenotype (Matsumoto et al., 1999; Li et al., 2000). SOCS-1 was subsequently identified by both functional and biochemical approaches. These and later studies established that SOCS-1 and several related proteins (e.g. SOCS-2 and SOCS-3) were both rapidly expressed in a STAT dependent process and capable of antagonizing STAT signaling (reviewed in Nicola et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2000; Kile et al., 2001). However, the most compelling evidence that SOCS-1, SOCS-2 and SOCS-3 antagonize STAT signaling has come from gene targeting studies. SOCS-1 null mice were found to die between the second and third weeks of life from a diffuse lymphocyte dependent inflammatory response (Naka et al., 1998; Starr et al., 1998). This has been attributed to imbalanced/chronically-upregulated IFN-g-Stat1 and IL-4-Stat6 activities, highlighting the essential role SOCS-1 plays in negatively regulating these signaling pathways (Alexander et al., 1999; Marine et al., 1999a; Naka et al., 2001). SOCS2 null mice developed gigantism, which has been attributed to imbalanced/chronically-upregulated GH-Stat5 and IGF1 activities (Metcalf et al., 2000). SOCS-3 null mice developed a marked erythrocytosis that led to embryonic lethality at days E12-E16 (Marine et al., 1999b). This has been attributed to imbalanced/chronically-upregulated Epo-Stat5 activity. Consistent with this, SOCS-3 transgenic mice were found to die of anemia secondary to a block in EpoStat5 signaling (Marine et al., 1999b). Contrasting the rapid progress that has been made in describing SOCS (i.e. SOCS-1, SOCS-2 and SOCS-3) biology, the mechanism by which they antagonize JAK-STAT signaling has remained more controversial. Although it is possible that different family members block signaling through distinct mechanisms (see below), the homology between family members makes this seem unlikely. For example, CIS is believed to antagonize signaling by blocking STAT receptor recruitment (Yoshimura et al., 1995; Matsumoto et al., 1999; Li et al., 2000). SOCS-1 is believed to impede signaling through a direct interaction with the JAK activation loop (Yasukawa et al., 1999). SOCS-3 binds Jak2, but fails to block its catalytic activity (Chen et al., 2000). The ability of SOCS-3 to antagonize IL-6 stimulated Stat3 activity is dependent on the same gp130 phos-

photyrosine that recruits SHP-2 (Ohtani et al., 2000; Schmitz et al., 2000). Finally, some studies have determined that the conserved SOCS-box promotes association with the elongin B/C complex, which binds an E3-like ubiquitin ligase, cullin-2, to regulate proteosomal degradation (Kamura et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1999a). Consistent with the possibility that SOCS proteins promote the degradation of associated signaling molecules, CIS-1 has been shown to be ubiquitinated and proteosome inhibitors enhance IL-6 dependent SOCS-3 expression (Zhang et al., 1999a). In summary, SOCS proteins appear to play an important role in negatively regulating specific STAT signaling pathways by a mechanism(s) that remains to be fully elucidated. 4.1.5. STAT modification STAT activity can also be negatively regulated through direct modifications, most notably dephosphorylation (see Section 4.1.3). Another well-characterized modification is the generation of carboxy-terminally truncated isoforms. Although these isoforms are often generated at the transcript level (i.e. by RNA read-through (Sasse et al., 1997)), they can also be generated by protein processing (Meyer et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1999). These truncated STATs appear to largely function as dominant interfering isoforms (Caldenhoven et al., 1996; Kieslinger et al., 2000; Piazza et al., 2000). Recently, STAT methylation has also been reported, but the physiological significance of this modification has not been fully elucidated (Mowen et al., 2001). 4.1.6. STAT inhibitor proteins Yeast two hybrid screens have identified a number of STAT interacting proteins (see also Section 4.2.2), including the PIAS (Protein Inhibitor of Activated STATs) family (reviewed in Shuai, 2000). This family has grown to five proteins, PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASy, PIASxa and PIASxb, each with an N-terminal LXXLL signature motif, a putative Znbinding motif, a highly acidic domain and a serine/threonine rich C-terminal motif (Shuai, 2000). PIAS1 appears to bind to activated Stat1 dimers, thereby blocking their ability to bind DNA (Liao et al., 2000). Analogously, PIAS3 impedes Stat3 DNA binding activity (Chung et al., 1997). Recently dPIAS, a PIAS homologue in Drosophila has been demonstrated to negatively regulate the Drosophila STAT, Stat92E. Also a correctly balanced dPIAS/Stat92E ratio is critical for blood cell and eye development in Drosophila (Betz et al., 2001 #2738). Gene targeting studies should help to define the overall significance of PIAS proteins in the regulation of STAT signaling. 4.2. Positive regulation of STAT function Although initial studies focused on the role tyrosine kinases play in STAT activation, more recent studies have identified other positive regulators. This includes serine kinases and interacting proteins.

4.2.1. Serine phosphorylation The recognition that STATs can be modified by serine phosphorylation raised the possibility of cross-talk between signaling cascades (Decker and Kovarik, 2000). Initial studies demonstrated phosphorylation of serine 727, in a PMSP motif, in both Stat1 and Stat3 (Wen et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1995). The conservation of the PMSP motif in the carboxy-termini of Stat1, Stat3, Stat4, and Stat5, raised the possibility that proline-directed serine kinases (e.g. MAP kinases (Gonzalez et al., 1991)) were responsible for this modification. This issue remains controversial, however, in part because different serine kinases have been found to phosphorylate Stat1 and Stat3 depending on the nature of the stimulus and co-stimulus (Decker and Kovarik, 2000). Reporter gene studies have determined that serine phosphorylation enhances transcriptional activity of Stat1 and Stat3 (Wen et al., 1995; Decker and Kovarik, 2000). More physiological studies in Stat1 deficient cells reconstituted with Stat1 and Stat1 S727A demonstrated that serine phosphorylation only enhances the ability of Stat1 to drive expression of some, but not all target genes (Kovarik et al., 2001). Recent studies also indicate that serine phosphorylation enhances Stat4 transcriptional activity (Visconti et al., 2000). Although both Stat5 and Stat6 can become serine phosphorylated, enhanced transcriptional activity has not convincingly been demonstrated (Yamashita et al., 1998). Rather, for Stat5, serine phosphorylation appears to enhance protein stability (Beuvink et al., 2000). 4.2.2. Interaction with other transcription factors and cellular proteins The transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes involves the specific and ordered interaction of a large number of proteins including enhancer/promoter specific transcription factors, chromosomal remodeling complexes and components of the basal transcriptional machinery (Maniatis et al., 1998; Pugh, 2000). Consistent with these observations, numerous studies have described a robust interaction between STATs and other transcriptional regulators. The first evidence of an interaction between STATs and other transcription factor was evident when IRF-9 (p48) co-purified with Stat1 and Stat2 in the ISGF-3 complex (Schindler and Strehlow, 2000). Subsequent analysis of STAT dependent promoters provided both functional and biochemical evidence for the interaction with other transcription factors. Stat1 was shown to interact with NF-k B, Sp1, USF-1, PU.1 and the glucocorticoid receptor (Look et al., 1995; Ohmori et al., 1997; Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 1998; Aittomaki et al., 2000). Stat3 was shown to interact with Sp1, c-Jun and the glucocorticoid receptor (Schaefer et al., 1997; Cantwell et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1999b). Stat5 was shown to interact with YY-1, Sp1, C/EBPb and the glucocorticoid receptor (Meier and Groner, 1994; Stocklin et al., 1996; Martino et al., 2001; Wyszomierski and Rosen, 2001). Stat6 has been shown to associate with NF-k B and C/EBPb (Mikita et al., 1998; Shen and Stavnezer, 1998).

Other studies have demonstrated the association between STATs and proteins that facilitate transcription through chromatin modification. Yeast two hybrid screens have played an important role in these studies. Not unexpectedly, the first chromosome modifying proteins shown to interact with a STAT (i.e. Stat2) were CBP/p300 (Bhattacharya et al., 1996). Subsequent studies have demonstrated functional and physical association between CBP/p300 and other STATs (Horvath, 2000). More recently other chromatin modifying proteins have been shown to associate or function with STATs. They include BRAC1, Mcm5, Nmi and HMG-I(Y) (Zhang et al., 1998; Zhu et al., 1999; Ouchi et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2001). Finally, yeast two hybrid screens have identified non-nuclear proteins that associate with STATs. This includes: StIP1, a novel cytosolic WD40 protein that appears to facilitate the interaction between JAKs and STATs; STAM, a JAK binding protein; and SH2-B, a GH receptor binding protein (Takeshita et al., 1997; Carter-Su et al., 2000; Collum et al., 2000). Detailed analysis of several eukaryotic promoters suggests that the modest number of interactions outlined in this section will grow as STAT dependent promoters begin to undergo more rigorous scrutiny (e.g. Zhang et al., 1999b; Kim et al., 2001). These studies are also likely to provide insight into the ability of STAT modifications, like serine phosphorylation, to differentially regulate the expression of some but not other genes. 5. Concluding comments STATs were first identified as IFN dependent transcription factors. However, now seven members of the mammalian STAT family are known to transduce vital signals for all ,50 hematopoietin ligands (see Table 1), as well as a limited number of additional ligands. Characterization of STAT homologs in Drosophila and Dictyostelium suggest that this family evolved with the need for increased cell-tocell communication. STATs continued to co-evolve with mammals, increasing both in number and diversity of function. In contrast to their largely developmental role in lower eukaryotes, mammalian STATs play a critical role in mediating the host response to stress, especially pathogens. The last several years have seen important advances in STAT biology, including solution of the first STAT crystal structures and the generation of knockouts for each mammalian STAT. These studies have not only highlighted a significant level of fidelity and specificity in STAT signaling, but will be valuable reagents for future studies in understanding how STATs regulate host development and responses.
