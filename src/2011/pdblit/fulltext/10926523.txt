Site selection is a part of strategic management activities. Location selection decisions involved many factors that may be conflicting in nature. Considering the tangible along with intangible factors in location selection problem, this paper propose a hybrid method of multi criteria decision making (MCDM) that make it possible to select the optimal location that satisfies the decision maker. With the aid of fuzzy AHP, our proposed model considers objective, critical, and subjective factors as the three main common factors in location analysis. The last two factors, critical and subjective factors, are defined by decision maker's judgments for more adoption with the real world problems. Besides, analysis of a numerical example and the sensitivity analysis are discussed to clarify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model in the facility location problem.

1. Introduction Location theory was first introduced by Weber, see [1], who considered the problem of locating a single warehouse in order to minimize the total travel distance between the warehouse and a set of spatially distributed costumers. Indeed, he proposed a material index for the selection of the location which if this index is greater than one, the warehouse should be installed in the vicinity of the source of raw material and otherwise, it must be near to the market. Isard [2] reconsidered this work with the study of the industrial location, land use, and the related problems. Hotelling [3] introduced another early location problem that considered the problem of locating two competing vendors along a straight line. Hakimi [4] considered the general problem of locating one or more facilities on a network to minimize the sum of the distances and the maximum distance between facilities and points on a network. Considerable research and theoretical interest in the location problem has been carried out after this seminal paper. Later, a primary facility location model proposed for a multi-dimensional location problem based on critical factors, objective factors, and subjective factors by Brown and Gibson [5] and Buffa and Sarin [6]. Fortenberry and Mitra [7] presented a model for the location­allocation problems considering both qualitative and quantitative factors. Kahne [8] considered 29 attributes and used a weighting model to determine the relative importance with uncertainty in attributes. Charnetski [9] proposed the case of selecting one of the three proposed sites for a modern air terminal with a large number of attributes. Bahattacharya et al. [10] proposed a holistic method for the facility location selection based on the ones presented by Brown and Gibson [5] and Buffa and Sarin [6] with the aids of AHP, but they did not consider the critical factors from their model. This paper proposes a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology that is suitable for a location problem under some conflicting criteria in nature. The main goal of this paper is to provide investors and managers with a more efficient

model for location selection decisions. In addition, we discuss a multi-attribute location model which considers critical, objective and subjective factors with triangular fuzzy numbers to give a clear indication about the location selection problem in the real-world situations. The structure of this paper is as follows: First, we provide the proposed mathematical model of site selection problems. Second, an MCDM methodology which includes fuzzy numbers and the formulation of fuzzy AHP is described in details. Analysis of a numerical example and the sensitivity analysis are then discussed in order to verify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model in the facility location problem. Finally, we conclude with a summery, and applications to the future work. 2. Proposed mathematical model We use the following notations in the state of equations and relations:

FSFMi determines one composite score that is the average of the fuzzy scores values of the location for each factor. The locations are ranked based on the FLSIi index as follows:

Choice of a is a critical and important issue depending on the decision maker's preference. In this paper, the value of a is considered by 0.36 as given in [10], however, the other range and values of a is also considered in our proposed decision framework. 2.1. Proposed methodology In this paper, we extend the work by Bhattacharya et al. [10] and Kaboli et al. [11,12] utilized AHP and fuzzy AHP for the facility location selection problem respectively. However, in this article we consider critical factors playing crucial roles for location selection such as: political decisions, marginal risk along with the previous criteria stating in [11­13]. The triangular fuzzy numbers are denoted as (l, m, u) which the parameters l, m, and u denote the smallest possible value, the most promising value, and the largest possible value describing a fuzzy event, respectively. In our proposed framework, the pair-wise comparisons in the judgment matrix are fuzzy numbers modified by the decision maker. This procedure elaborates a sequence of weight vectors to combine the scores on each attribute. Also, it computes a corresponding set of scores and determines one composite score that is the average of these fuzzy scores. We attempt to address this important issue as follows: ``How our proposed decision framework can help decision maker to make a suitable and rational decision?" The general goal, criteria, and location alternatives are presented in Fig. 1, which depicts the hierarchy for the location selection problem. The first level of the hierarchy shows that the general goal is selecting the best location. At the second level, the five criteria subjective factors that Kulkarni et al. [13] stated are as follows: work culture (C1), climatic condition (C2), housing

facility (C3), transportation availability (C4), and recreational facility (C5). At the third level we have five location alternatives for selection. All of these levels will contribute to the achievement of the general goal. The more factors and alternatives we have, the bigger hierarchy process must be represented. 2.1.1. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is one analytical approach used for solving the complex problem. Some authors used the AHP as a stand-alone methodology to make location decisions [14,15]. The AHP enables the decision maker to structure a complex problem in the form of a simple hierarchy and to evaluate a large number of quantitative and qualitative factors in a systematic manner with the conflicting multiple criteria [16]. One of the main advantages of this method is the relative ease with which it handles multiple criteria [17]. Also this approach is easier to understand and it can handle both quantitative and qualitative data. Although AHP involves the principles of decomposition, pair-wise comparison, and priority vector generation and synthesis, yet it cannot reflect the human thinking style. So, fuzzy AHP, a fuzzy extension of AHP, was developed to overcome this weakness. Fuzzy set theory implements classes or groupings of data with boundaries that are not sharply defined (i.e., fuzzy) [17]. The benefit of extending crisp theory and analysis methods to fuzzy techniques is the strength in solving real-word problems, which inevitably entail some degree of imprecision and noise in the variables and parameters measured and processed for the application [17]. By embedding the AHP method into fuzzy sets, another application area of the fuzzy logic is revealed. Decision makers usually find that it is more confident to give interval judgments than fixed value judgment. This is because usually he/she is unable to explicit about his/her preferences due to the fuzzy nature of the comparison process [17]. Due to relatively easier steps of Chang's extension than the other fuzzy AHP and similarity to the crisp AHP, this approach is applied in our proposed model. Let X = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} be an object set, and U = {u1, u2, . . . , un} be a goal set according to the method of Chang's [17,18] extending analysis, each object is taken and extent analysis for each goal, gi, is performed, respectively. Therefore, m extent analysis value for each object can be obtained, with the following signs:

where all the following: Ljgi

i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n;

ðj ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; mÞ are triangular fuzzy numbers [19]. The steps of Chang's extent analysis can be given as in the

where d is the ordinate of the highest intersection point D between l(L1) and l(L2) as shown in Fig. 2. Both values of V(L1 P L2) and V(L2 P L1) are applied for comparing L1 and L2.

3. Numerical example In order to benchmark the proposed MCDM approach, a numerical example is illustrated herein. It is assumed that a company is looking for selecting a location to build a new facility from five alternatives. The problem considers tangible factors such as: cost of land, cost of transportation, cost of energy, cost of raw material, and cost of land as cost factor component which are computed and tabulated in Table 1 for each location. Also, critical factors are tabulated in Table 2, as mentioned; the critical factors play indispensable roles for location selection. The political decisions, marginal risk are the examples of such these factors. One may consider the other important factors in the decision making frame. 4. Computational result The proposed methodology is coded and solved as a computer program in C language that enables the user to select the most suitable site among available selection. Table 3 shows fuzzy objective factors measures (FOFMi) for each location which are calculated separately by using the fuzzy objective factor components (FOFCi) in Table 2 and Eq. (2).

Also, W0 = (0, 0.537, 0, 1, 0.094). Thus, the normalized weight vector from Table 5 is calculated as WF3 = (0, 0.329, 0, 0.613, 0.057)T.

From Table 7, SL1 = (13.33, 16.50, 20)  (36.25, 47.01, 58.78) = (483.35, 775.66, 1175.67), SL2 = (7, 11, 15)  (36.25, 47.01, 58.78) = (253.76, 517.10, 881.75), SL3 = (7.65, 8.83, 10.17)  (36.25, 47.01, 58.78) = (277.32, 415.25, 597.63), SL4 = (1.77, 1.98, 2.37)  (36.25, 47.01, 58.78) = (64.09, 92.90, 139.12), SL5 = (6.50, 8.70, 11.25)  (36.25, 47.01, 58.78) = (235.63, 408.98, 661.31) are obtained. Using these vectors, V(SL1 P SL2) = 1, V(SL1 P SL3) = 1, V(SL1 P SL4) = 1, V(SL1 P SL5) = 1, V(SL2 P SL1) = 0.61, V(SL2 P SL3) = 1, V(SL2 P SL4) = 1, V(SL2 P SL5) = 1, V(SL3 P SL1) = 0.24, V(SL3 P SL2) = 0.77, V(SL3 P SL4) = 1, V(SL3 P SL5) = 1, V(SL4 P SL1) = 0, V(SL4 P SL2) = 0, V(SL4 P SL3) = 0, V(SL4 P SL5) = 0, V(SL5 P SL1) = 0.33, V(SL5 P SL2) = 0.79, V(SL5 P SL3) = 0.98, V(SL5 P SL4) = 1 are obtained. Also, W0 = (1, 0.606, 0.241, 0, 0.327). Thus, the normalized weight vector from Table 7 is calculated as WF5 = (0.460, 0.279, 0.111, 0, 0.150)T. From Table 8, SF1 = (6.53, 8.75, 11.33)  (46.86, 59.51, 73.08) = (306.14, 520.71, 828.28), SF2 = (11.33, 14.50, 18)  (46.86, 59.51, 73.08) = (531.06, 862.89, 1315.50), SF3 = (15, 19, 23)  (46.86, 59.51, 73.08) = (702.88, 1130.68, 1680.92), SF4 = (7.42, 9.53, 11.75)  (46.86, 59.51, 73.08) = (347.53, 567.32, 858.73), SF5 = (6.58, 7.73, 9)  (46.86, 59.51, 73.08) = (308.09, 459.78, 657.75) are obtained. Using these vectors, V(SF1 P SF2) = 1, V(SF1 P SF3) = 1, V(SF1 P SF4) = 1, V(SF1 P SF5) = 1, V(SF2 P SF1) = 0, V(SF2 P SF3) = 0, V(SF2 P SF4) = 0, V(SF2 P SF5) = 1, V(SF3 P SF1) = 0.16, V(SF3 P SF2) = 1, V(SF3 P SF4) = 0.55, V(SF3 P SF5) = 1, V(SF4 P SF1) = 0.61, V(SF4 P SF2) = 1, V(SF4 P SF3) = 1, V(SF4 P SF5) = 1, V(SF5 P SF1) = 0, V(SF5 P SF2) = 0.55, V(SF5 P SF3) = 0, V(SF5 P SF4) = 0 are obtained. Also, W0 = (1, 0, 0.157, 0.010, 0.551). Thus, the normalized weight vector from Table 8 is calculated as W = (0.431, 0, 0.068, 0.263, 0.238). Now, from Tables 3­8 we put all the normalized weights like WF1 = (0.636, 0, 0.364, 0, 0)T, WF2 = (0.082, 0.334, 0.480, 0.104, 0)T, WF3 = (0, 0.329, 0, 0.613, 0.057)T, WF4 = (0.274, 0.420, 0, 0.090, 0.214)T, WF5 = (0.460, 0.279, 0.111, 0, 0.150)T, and W = (0.431, 0, 0.068, 0.263, 0.238) on the corresponding rows and columns. Then, FSFMfor each location is calculated.

For determination FSFM these steps should be followed: first we generate decision matrix for each location, second SLi must be calculated, third comparison of Li P Lj for each matrix must be done. After calculation of the weight vectors W', the normalized weight vectors W are calculated as stated above, W is a non-fuzzy number. Table 9 consolidates the results of the mentioned operations for the alternatives. By using the data which is illustrated in Table 1 and based on the Eq. (2), FOFMi can be elaborated for each location as shown in Table 10. Table 11 shows the location analysis based on the proposed hybrid methodology. For computation of FOFMi for each location the parameter m, which is the most promising value of the triangular fuzzy numbers (l, m, u), is considered to determine FLSIi and FSFMi results are used from the Table 3. The overall critical factor measures (CFi), as stated in Eq. (1), are calculated by multiplying each critical factor. As stated, a is the weight assigned to the fuzzy subjective factor measures. The value of a in this paper is 0.36, where 0 6 a 6 1. Let the overall critical factor measures are 1, then for a = 1, FLSI = FSFM indicating that selection is dependent on fuzzy subjective factor measures values found from the fuzzy AHP and FSFM values dominate over FOFM values. Also, for a = 0 the cost factors get priority than the intangible factors. Note that in our proposed approach, the unit of the fuzzy objective factor cost (FOFC) is in terms of US Dollars. Whereas the fuzzy objective factors measure (FOFMi) and the FLSIi are a non-dimensional quantity. Table 12 shows the final ranking based on the proposed methodology. The location L1 has more priority than L3 and the location L5 with lower weight are sorted. By the preference of decision maker (DM) each of these three locations maybe selected. The sensitivity analysis is shown in the next section to verify the practicality and efficacy of the result of the proposed approach. 4.1. Sensitivity analysis Due to dynamic nature of the decision environment in the real life situation, it is essential to equip the proposed model with the capability to distinguish changes in the facility location selection process. As mentioned above, the related equation for each of the five alternatives for location is as follows: FLSIi = CFi Â [(a Â FSFMi) + (1 À a) Â FOFMi]. Lines are depicted for each location for evaluation ranging between 0 and 1 as shown in Fig. 3. In this example, among of all locations, location 3 has the highest FLSI index when the objective factor decision is between 0.0 and 0.24 and location 1 is preferred to other location when the factor decision weight is between 0.24 and 1. Also, optimal range of a is illustrated in Table 13.

The value of 0.5 for a is a critical value because moving to higher value of a, FSFMi is dominant and location 1 is preferred. Also, moving to lower than 0.5 results dominancy of cost factor components and depend on the range of a locations 1 and 3 are preferred. So, the intangible factors get less priority. Summing up, it is essential to justify the proper value for a and it actually depends on the decision maker judgment and preference. 5. Conclusions In this paper, an MCDM methodology has been introduced for any organization seeking a site for a new facility or a relocation of the existing facility. The solution procedure was illustrated through a numerical example. As shown in the computational results, any change in the decision maker's preferences, a ratio, and costs could affect the desirability of a specific location which is considered in this proposed model to show the flexibility of the proposed model. The results of the mathematical model have shown the effectiveness and adaptation of our holistic model with the real-world problems. The consideration of the objective, subjective and critical factors can be more acquaint with the adoption of the mathematical model with the real world problems. A framework for decision making under uncertainty, developing a decision model to help decision makers in large-scale location­allocation problems can be considered as a future research extension.
