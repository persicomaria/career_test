Abstract The injection of the Grb2 adapter in Xenopus oocytes promotes G2/M transition without stimulation from a receptor only the first day after the oocytes removal from the ovaries. This cell cycle reinitiation is Ras-dependent and requires the SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2. The SH2 domain of Grb2 binds the tyrosine phosphorylated lipovitellin1, a homologue of the human apolipoprotein B. The N-SH3 domain of Grb2 is linked to a proline-rich sequence of the C2 domain of PLC-1, PLC-1 itself is linked, through its SH3 domain, to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Sos. When Grb2­PLC-1­Sos is associated, PLC-1 is not phosphorylated on Y783 but shows a phospholipase activity. Inhibition of lipovitellin 1 or PLC-1 avoids Grb2-induced cell cycle reinitiation. Therefore, the Grb2­lipovitellin 1 association is the starting point of a novel signaling pathway, where PLC-1 binds Grb2 and recruits Sos. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Grb2 (growth factor receptor bound protein 2) is an adapter that links receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to the Ras pathway [1]. It is involved in pleiotropic cellular functions and in several pathological processes. Particularly, overexpression of the Grb2 gene is observed in human breast cancers where it is correlated with an upregulation of the Ras/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway, and where it plays a role in tumor progression [2,3]. Interactions between Grb2 and different partners serve to control and to modulate signal transduction pathways [4]. Grb2 consists of a single SH2 (Src homology domain) domain flanked by two SH3 domains [4­8]. By means of its SH2 domain, Grb2 recognizes specific phosphotyrosine (pY) sequences containing the pYXNX motif present in activated RTKs, and in phosphorylated adapter proteins [9,10,4]. Through its SH3 domains, Grb2 binds proline-rich sequences of

the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos (Son of Sevenless) [11] and initiates the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade, also known as the Ras/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases). However, atypical interactions exist in some cell lines where Grb2 binds to the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through its SH3 domain [12] or to PLC-1 (phospholipase C-1) [13]. PLC-1 recruited by RTK participates in vital intracellular signaling mechanisms and is overexpressed in carcinoma [14,15]. PLC-1 presents two SH2 domains that bind to RTKs leading to PLC-1 phosphorylation and activation. Its SH3 domain binds to proline-rich region of many signaling molecules, such as Sos [16]. The two X and Y catalytic domains of PLC-1 hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) implicated in intracellular Ca2+mobilization [17]. Both Grb2 and PLC-1 are signaling cascade targets of high interest to develop anti-proliferative strategies. A powerful and widely used integrated biological model, the Xenopus oocyte enables to analyze these transduction cascade effectors. Xenopus oocytes are physiologically arrested at the

G2 stage of the first meiotic prophase. They enter into the M phase after stimulation by growth factors [18,19] or progesterone [20] that trigger Ras-dependent and -independent pathways and lead to the G2/M transition. This event can be easily monitored by the appearance of a white spot at the animal pole, which corresponds to the germinal vesicle break-down (GVBD). When Xenopus oocytes are removed from the ovaries after (and only after) the first day, the injection of the Grb2 adapter protein in oocytes promotes meiosis reinitiation in the absence of any stimulation from a tyrosine kinase receptor. The meiosis induction is Ras-dependent and requires both SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 [21]. To understand this unusual recruitment and the initiation of this Grb2 transduction cascade, we searched for direct binding partners of Grb2 capable to mediate oocyte cell cycle G2/M transition. The present results demonstrate that Grb2 is co-immunoprecipitated with lipovitellin 1, PLC-1 and Sos. The SH2 domain of Grb2 binds a tyrosine phosphorylated lipovitellin 1, an homologue of the human apolipoprotein B (Apo B), present in day 1 oocytes. Lipovitellin 1 is a fragment derived from a vitellus precursor called vitellogenin. The N-SH3 domain of Grb2, but not the C-SH3, is linked to a proline-rich sequence of the C-terminal domain of PLC-1, the C2 domain. PLC-1, through its SH3 domain, is linked to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Sos. This association can be disrupted with PLC-1 SH3 domain and poly-proline rich peptide from Sos. When Grb2­PLC-1­Sos is associated, PLC-1 is not tyrosine phosphorylated on Y783 but displays a phospholipase activity recorded by electrophysiological experiments through the activation of a calcium-dependent chloride current testifying for the hydrolysis of phospholipids PIP2. For the first time, a non-canonical cascade: lipovitellin 1­Grb2­PLC-1­Sos reinitiates the G2/M cell cycle.
2. Materials and methods 2.1. Oocyte handling
After anesthesia of Xenopus laevis with MS 222 (1 g/l, Sandoz, France), ovarian fragments were surgically removed and placed in ND96 medium (in mM: NaCl 96, KCl 2, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 5, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH), supplemented with streptomycin/penicillin (50 g/ml, Eurobio, France), sodium pyruvate (225 g/ml, Sigma, France) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (30 g/ml, Sigma) [21]. Stage VI oocytes were harvested by using 1 h treatment with collagenase A (1 mg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Complete defolliculation of the oocytes was achieved by manual dissection. The oocytes were kept at 19 °C in ND96 medium.

317 peptide (phosphorylated peptide (PSpYVNVQN), the binding domain of Shc to the SH2 domain of Grb2), or 120 nl of PLC-1 antibodies, or 250 ng of proline-rich peptides from PLC-1: N-ter, CGPGAPSE (C-8-E); C-ter, QTPNKPMQ (Q-8-Q); C2, LNPVWPAKPFHL (L-12-L) (NeoMPS, France), or 100 ng of proline-rich hSos1 peptide 1144­1163: TDEVPVPPPVPPRRRPESAP (T-20-P) (provided by Dr. Broutin). Transfer of cytoplasm from day 1 or day 3 oocytes to day 3 oocytes was performed: 120 nl of cytoplasm was removed from day 3 receiving oocytes to avoid a lethal volume modification before microinjection with 80 nl of cytoplasm extracted from day 1 or day 3 oocytes added with 80 nl of Grb2 and 80 nl of water, or Shc317, or X anti-LV1. The experiments were performed with day 1 and day 3 cytoplasm depleted or not in vitellus platelets by a centrifugation at 4 °C, 12 000 g for 15 min. GVBD was determined by the appearance of a white spot at the center of the animal pole. For each experiments at least 2 animals were used and 20­30 oocytes/animal were removed.

2.4. Oocyte extracts
Oocytes were lysed in buffer A added with 500 mM NaCl (1 oocyte/10 l). Buffer A: 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.05% (v/v) SDS, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 g/ml leupeptin, 10 g/ml aprotinin, 10 g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 g/ml benzamidine, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM sodium vanadate. The extracts were obtained by centrifugation (12 000 g, 15 min at 4 °C).

2.5. Pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments
All pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments were realized 2 h after the injection of Grb2 unless specified. Protein pull-down were realized within a column at 4 °C, for which Grb2 is bound through its SH3 domains to poly-proline beads in order to permit the SH2 domain to bind to potential ligands. Extracts from 500 oocytes from day 1 and day 3 were realized in buffer A added with 150 mM of NaCl and deposited on these columns. After three washes with buffer A added with 150 mM NaCl, proteins were eluted with buffer A added with a concentration range of NaCl from 250 mM to 650 mM, and were analyzed by silver stained SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting the fraction eluted with 250 mM of NaCl, showing the higher concentration of 100 kDa protein was used. As control for day 1, a column composed solely by beads in the absence of Grb2 was used. Immunoprecipitation: oocyte extracts were realized in buffer A added with 500 mM NaCl. Some incubations were performed with antibodies raised against a peptide mapping at the C-terminus (Grb2 (C-23)) for the Grb2 WT and P49L constructs or the N-terminal of Grb2 (Grb2 (H-68)) for the Grb2 G203R construct (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. USA) or PLC-1 (Upstate, USA), for 2 h at 4 °C, and followed by protein A-agarose addition (50%, BD Biosciences, Belgium) for 1 h at 4 °C. In Fig. 5, Grb2 was covalently coupled to Cyanogen Bromide Activated Sepharose 4B beads as described by the manufacturer (Sigma, France), to avoid interference with X anti-LV1 antibodies. For all immunoprecipitation, beads with immun-complexes were collected by centrifugation and rinsed three times for 10 min with buffer A (500 mM NaCl) devoid of Triton X-100. Immun-complexes were resuspended in Laëmmli sample buffer, and subjected to a SDS-PAGE.

2.2. Recombinant protein production
Recombinant Grb2 wild type and Grb2 P49L and Grb2 G203R mutants were bacterially expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described before [22].

2.6. Electrophoresis and Western blot analysis
Electrophoresis were performed on 15% modified polyacrylamide gels (to determine the phosphorylation state of Erk2 [23] or on 7.5%. For Western blot analysis, after electrophoresis proteins were transferred to a Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences, France) in the following buffer (15 mM Tris HCL pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% bovine serum albumin, Sigma). The membranes were incubated with anti-Grb2 (anti-Grb2 (C-23), 1:20 000; and anti-Grb2 (H-68), 1:10 000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), antiPLC-1 (1:5 000), anti-phospho-PLC-1 (Tyr 783) (1:5 000) (Upstate Biotechnology, USA), anti-Sos (1:8 000), anti-Erk2 (1:15 000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), X anti-LV1 and anti-L (1:15 000), anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) (1:5 000) (BD Biosciences, Belgium) antibodies. Antibodies complexes

2.3. Microinjections, transfers of cytoplasm and GVBD analysis
All microinjections were performed in the oocyte equatorial region with 100 ng of Grb2 (wild type, or P49L or G203R mutants), or 100 ng of SH2, or SH3 domains of Grb2, or 200 ng of SH2-SH2 tandem or SH3 domains of PLC1, or 50 or 100 ng of anti-Lipovitellin 1 of X. laevis (X anti-LV1) or 100 ng of anti-LV1 of Pleuronectes yokohamae (teleost fish) (anti-L), or 100 ng of Shc

Fig. 3. The 100 kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein is the lipovitellin 1. Samples eluted from the columns depicted in Fig. 2 (lane 2, day1 (D1); lane 3, day 3 (D3)) were submitted to Western blot analysis with Xenopus anti-lipovitellin 1 antibodies (X anti-LV1) and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 (anti-PY). The current recorded on oocytes voltage-clamped at -80 mV called I-80 is a long-used and reliable mean of recording calcium-dependent chloride current activated both by calcium release from the intracellular stores and by calcium influx [26]. I-80 recording data are shown typically for an experimental run on one oocyte, but the finding were always confirmed by recordings on at least 3 oocytes belonging to a same batch (isolated from a single female) and this was repeated for at least 3 batches. For voltage step experiments, oocytes were held at - 35 mV and stepped to +40 mV for 1 s, to - 140 mV for 1 s, then back to - 35 mV. This two steps protocol is modified from the triple steps protocol described by Kuruma and Hartzell [27] and allows the recording of the so-called ICl currents. The first step records a non-inactivating outward current: the outward ICl1-S was measured at the end of the first pulse at +40 mV. The second step records a slow inward current: the inward ICl2 was measured at the end of the second pulse at -140 mV. ICl variations are recognized as reliable indicators of calcium fluxes in Xenopus oocytes: ICl1-S is activated by calcium release from internal stores, while ICl2 is activated by capacitative calcium influx [27,28]. For ICl recording, results are given as mean ± S.E.M., with n the number of oocytes belonging to 2 batches of oocytes.

Cytoplasm with vitellus platelets (CVP) or without (C) was transferred from day 1 (D1) or day 3 (D3) oocytes to day 3 oocytes with Grb2 and water, or Shc317, or Xenopus antilipovitellin 1 antibodies (X anti-LV1). The oocyte extracts were submitted to a 15% modified gel, transferred, blotted with anti-Erk2 antibodies. The arrow indicates the phosphorylated form of Erk2.

were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biociences, France).

2.7. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-1
The tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-1 on Y783 was determined with the anti-phospho-PLC-1 (Tyr 783) antibodies (1:5 000) (Upstate Biotechnology, USA). To ascertain the quality of our antibodies we have simultaneously tested this antibody on the signaling cascade of a RTK [24], a chimera, composed of the human extracellular domain of the PDGF receptor and the intracellular domain of FGF receptor 1 of Pleurodeles waltlii. Oocytes expressing PDGFFGFR1 mRNAs, for 48 h, were injected or not with 75 ng of Grb14 (an inhibitor of RTK transduction), 1 h before stimulation with 5 nM of PDGF as described [23,25]. After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with anti-PDGFR antibodies (reacting with the extracellular domain of the chimera, 1/150, BD Biosciences, Belgium). Protein A-agarose (50%, Sigma, France) was added for 1 h at 4 °C. Immun-complexes were collected by centrifugation, rinsed three times, resuspended in Laëmmli sample buffer and subjected to a SDSPAGE.

3. Results 3.1. The SH2 domain of Grb2 binds to tyrosine phosphorylated lipovitellin 1 We have shown previously that the microinjection of Grb2 in Xenopus oocyte induces the cell cycle reinitiation only the first day after removal of the ovary. The SH2 domain of Grb2 is required to induce this response but no classical tyrosine kinase receptor is stimulated in this process. In these oocytes the only

2.8. Electrophysiological measurements
Oocytes were voltage clamped at room temperature using a custom made two electrodes amplifier in a Perspex chamber containing ND96 medium (the oocyte was maintained by negative suction). The oocyte was impaled by two glass microelectrodes pulled from thin walled glass capillary tubing (Clark Electromedical, UK) and filled with 3 M KCl (electrode resistance b5 M). The bath was grounded by a Ag/AgCl electrode through a 3 M KCl/agar bridge. The experimental protocols were controlled by pCLAMP 6 Software through a Digidata 1200B interface (Axon Instruments, USA).

Samples from day 1 naive oocytes eluted from a poly-proline column (lane 1), and samples from day 1 naive oocytes eluted from a poly-proline/Grb2 column (lane 2), or day 3 naive oocytes eluted from a polyproline/Grb2 column (lane 3) were subjected to electrophoresis and either (A) silver stained or (B) transferred and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 antibodies (anti-PY).

Oocytes were injected with Grb2 WT (Grb2) or not (-), or with the Grb2 (P49L) mutant, directly or 1 h after the injection of: phospho-peptide Shc 317 (Shc317), or 50 or 100 ng of Xenopus anti-lipovitellin 1 antibodies (X anti-LV1), or 100 ng of antilipovitellin from teleost (anti-L), or anti-PLC-1 antibodies (anti-PLC-1), or SH3 or SH2­SH2 domains of PLC-1. Lysates were submitted to a 15% modified gel, transferred, blotted with anti-Erk2 antibodies. The arrow indicates the phosphorylated form of Erk2.

Fig. 7. PLC-1 binds to Grb2 WT and Grb2 G203R but not to Grb2 P49L. Day 1 oocytes injected with Grb2 WT, Grb2 P49L, or Grb2 G203R were lysed 2 h after Grb2 injection and immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 antibodies (C-23, against the C-ter, lane 1 and 2 and H-68, against the N-ter, lane 3 and 4) followed by an incubation with protein A-agarose. Proteins obtained were analyzed by antiGrb2 (C-23, lane 1 and 2 and H-68, lane 3 and 4), anti-PLC-1 or anti-Sos immunoblotting. Fig. 5. Binding of Grb2 to lipovitellin 1 and PLC-1­Sos. Oocytes injected with (+) or without (-) Xenopus anti-LV1 antibodies (X anti-LV1) 1 h prior to Grb2 injection on day 1 (D1) or 3 (D3), lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 (C-23) antibodies. Proteins obtained were analyzed by anti-Grb2 (C-23), antiPLC-1, anti-Sos, X anti-LV1, or anti-phosphotyrosine PY 20 (anti-PY) immunoblotting. LV1 depicts the lipovitelline 1.

known RTKs, the insulin and the IGF receptors, are not triggers of the signaling cascade [21]. Cytoplasm, from day 1 oocytes (depleted or not in vitellus platelets) added with Grb2 and water and transferred to day 3 oocytes allows the oocytes to recover Erk2 phosphorylation and a cell cycle G2/M transition (GVBD), whereas the same experiment with cytoplasm of day 3 oocytes did not (Fig. 1). Microinjection of Shc 317, a peptide known to bind the SH2 domain of Grb2 or Xenopus anti-lipovitelline 1 antibodies, 1 h prior to Grb2 injection, inhibits this activation (Fig. 1). By using an affinity column in which Grb2 is bound through its SH3 domains, molecular effectors associated to the SH2 domain of Grb2 were searched. After microinjections of Grb2 on day 1 or 3, an electrophoresis of the oocyte extracts followed by a silver staining of the gel were performed with the eluted proteins from the column. The silver stained gel showed that the SH2 domain of Grb2 bound a 100 kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein on day 1 but not on day 3 (Fig. 2). A Western blot analysis was performed on samples, eluted from the oocyte of

day 1 or day 3 Grb2-column. X anti-LV1 antibodies recognized the 100 kDa protein as lipovitellin 1 on day 1. Its tyrosine phosphorylation state was detected with anti-phosphotyrosineantibodies PY20 (Fig. 3). In addition, when X anti-LV1 antibodies were injected 1 h before Grb2 injection on day 1, the antibodies inhibited Erk2 phosphorylation and GVBD (Fig. 4). On the other hand, a low concentration of X anti-LV1 antibodies (50 ng) or anti-lipovitellin from teleost fish antibodies (100 ng) did not prevent Erk2 phosphorylation nor GVBD (Fig. 4). 3.2. Grb2 binds to lipovitellin and PLC-1­Sos 2 h after injections of Grb2, at day 1 or day 3, Xenopus oocytes were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 covalently bound to sepharose beads to avoid immunoprecipitation of the

Grb2 was injected with (+) or without (-) the phosphopeptide Shc 317 exhibiting affinity for the SH2 domain of Grb2 in day 1 oocytes. Oocytes were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 (C-23) antibodies followed by an incubation with protein A-agarose. Proteins obtained were analyzed by anti-Grb2 (C-23), anti-PLC-1 or anti-Sos immunoblotting.

Fig. 8. PLC-1 acts as an adapter between the N-SH3 domain of Grb2 and the poly-proline-rich region of Sos. Oocytes were injected with N-SH3 domain or C-SH3 domain from Grb2 (Grb2 N-SH3, Grb2 C-SH3), or poly-proline motifs of PLC-1 (PP PLC-1) from the N-terminal (N-ter) or the C-terminal (C-ter) or C2 (C2) regions) or the poly-proline-rich region from Sos (PP Sos), 1 h before they were injected with Grb2 WT. Oocyte extracts were either immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 (C-23) antibodies followed by a precipitation with protein A-agarose, electrophoresed, transferred and blotted with anti-Sos, anti-PLC-1, anti-Grb2 (C-23) antibodies or submitted to a 15% modified gel, transferred and blotted with anti-Erk2 antibodies.

with Grb2, no Erk2 phosphorylation and no GVBD occurred (Fig. 8). These effects were not observed when Grb2 was coinjected with the C-SH3 domain. 3.4. PLC-1 links to Grb2 and Sos SH2­SH2 or SH3 domains of PLC-1 were injected into the oocytes of day 1, 1 h before Grb2 injection. The SH3 domain of PLC-1, but not the SH2­SH2 domains prevented Sos binding but not the binding of PLC-1 to Grb2 and suppressed Erk2 phosphorylation and GVBD (Figs. 4 and 9). Peptides containing proline-rich region of PLC-1 either from its N-terminal region (C-8-E) or its C-terminal region (F-9Q) or the C2 region (L-12-L) were injected 1 h before Grb2. Only L-12-L abolished immunoprecipitation of PLC-1 and Sos with Grb2, Erk2 phosphorylation and GVBD (Fig. 8). When the N-SH3 domain of Grb2 was incubated 1 h with L-12L and the mixture injected 1 h before Grb2 injection, Grb2induced GVBD occurred (100%; n = 3). On the contrary GVBD was prevented by incubation of L-12-L with the C-SH3 domain of Grb2 (0%; n = 3). These results indicate that the C2 region of PLC-1 bound to the N-SH3 domain of Grb2 but not to the CSH3 domain. The injection of the proline-rich peptide of Sos before the injection of Grb2 suppressed Sos immunoprecipitation with Grb2 and PLC-1 and abolished Erk2 phosphorylation and GVBD (Fig. 8). 3.5. PLC-1 exhibits a phospholipase activity without tyrosine phosphorylation At day 1, when PLC-1 was immunoprecipitated in complex with Grb2 and Sos, it was not detected by the anti-phospho-PLC1 antibodies raised against Y783, one major phosphorylated site involved in its lipase activity under RTK activation neither when oocytes were undergoing their cell cycle reinitiation (2 h after Grb2 injection) nor after the completion of the G2/M transition (15 h). This suggests an atypical binding of PLC-1 to Grb2 and Sos (Fig. 10). To ascertain the quality of the antibodies, oocytes expressing the chimera PDGFR-FGFR, stimulated with specific ligand

Fig. 9. The SH3 domain of PLC-1 binds Sos. The SH3 PLC-1 or the SH2­ SH2 PLC-1 was injected 1 h prior to Grb2 injection on day 1 oocytes. Oocytes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 (C-23) antibodies followed by an incubation with protein A-agarose, electrophoresed, transferred and immunodetected with anti-Grb2 (C-23), anti-PLC-1 and anti-Sos antibodies.

X anti-LV1 antibodies. After electrophoresis and Western blotting, LV1, but also PLC-1 and Sos, were found to be bound to Grb2 solely from day 1 oocytes (Fig. 5). Injection of X anti-LV1 antibodies, 1 h prior to Grb2, suppressed LV1, PLC-1 and Sos binding to Grb2 (Fig. 5). No binding was observed from day 3 oocytes whether or not they were injected with X anti-LV1 antibodies. Moreover anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) confirmed that the Grb2-immunoprecipitated LV1 was tyrosine phosphorylated at day 1 (Fig. 5). When Grb2 was injected at day 1 with or without the phosphorylated peptide Shc 317, the phosphorylated peptide prevented immunoprecipitation of PLC-1 and Sos with Grb2 (Fig. 6) and abolished Erk2 phosphorylation and GVBD (Fig. 4). 3.3. The N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 is required to bind PLC-1 Oocytes were injected at day 1 with Grb2 WT, with Grb2 P49L (inactivated in the N-terminal SH3 domain) or with Grb2 G203R (affected the C-terminal SH3 binding site and the SH3SH3 interface of Grb2). After anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis revealed the presence of PLC-1 and Sos bound to Grb2 WT and to Grb2 G203R but not to Grb2 P49L (Fig. 7). When Grb2 was co-injected with the N-SH3 domain of Grb2, on day 1, PLC-1 and Sos were not immunoprecipitated

Fig. 10. PLC-1 is not phosphorylated on Y783. Day 1 (D1) or 3 (D3) oocytes were lysed 2 h or 15 h (when the GVBD has occurred) after Grb2 injection and immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 (C-23) antibodies followed by an incubation with protein A-agarose. After electrophoresis of samples and transfer, membranes were blotted with anti-Grb2 (C-23), anti-PLC-1, anti-phosphoY783­PLC-1 (anti-P­PLC-1) or anti-Sos antibodies. To ascertain the quality of the anti-P­PLC-1 antibodies, oocytes expressing PDGFR-FGFR1 chimera injected (+) or not (-) with Grb14, 1 h before stimulation by PDGF-BB (PDGF), were immunoprecipated by PDGFR antibodies. Western blottings were performed with anti-PDGFR, anti-PLC-1 and anti-P­PLC-1 antibodies.

Fig. 11. Anti-PLC-1 antibodies injected 1 h before Grb2 affect the PLC-1 lipase activity without disrupting its binding to Grb2 and Sos. Oocytes injected (+) or none (-) with Grb2 and anti-PLC-1 antibodies were lysed. PLC-1 antibodies were removed by protein A-agarose pull-down and samples were analyzed by electrophoresis, transferred and immunodetected with anti-Grb2, anti-PLC-1, and anti-Sos antibodies.

PDGF-BB 1 h after they were injected or not with Grb14, an inhibitor of RTK transduction [23,25] were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PDGFR and immunobloted. PLC-1 was phos-

phorylated on Y783 only when it was activated by the growth factor receptor and not when Grb14 was previously injected and blocked its activity (Fig. 10). The injection of anti-PLC-1 antibodies known to abolish the PLC-1 enzymatic activity [29] blocked Erk2 phosphorylation and GVBD induced by Grb2 in day 1 oocytes (Fig. 4). Protein A pull-down of these PLC-1 antibodies in oocytes injected with Grb2 revealed that PLC-1 is still associated to Grb2 and Sos, which confirms that the action of the antibodies is not directed towards the destruction of the complex but against the phospholipase activity (Fig. 11). Electrophysiological measurement of the calcium dependent-chloride current (I-80) showed that microinjection of Grb2 in day 1 oocytes always triggered a sharp inward transient current (peak current was - 2380 ± 500 nA, the transient lasted for 19 ± 3 s before I-80 stabilization, n = 17; Fig. 12, A1), while no current was observed in days 3 and 4 oocytes (n = 26; Fig. 12, A2). In day 1, oocyte microinjections of Grb2 P49L failed to raise any variations in I-80 (n = 10; Fig. 12, A3), while Grb2

Fig. 12. PLC-1 displays a phospholipase activity when bound to Grb2 and Sos. The injection of Grb2 WT activates a calcium-dependent chloride current (I-80) only on day 1 oocytes. (A) Transient inward currents measured on oocyte voltage clamped at - 80 mV after microinjection of Grb2 WT in oocyte of day 1 (A1) or day 3 (A2), or Grb2 mutant P49L (A3) or G203R (A4), or Grb2 WT in oocytes pre-injected 1 h before with anti-PLC-1 antibodies in day 1 oocyte (A5). A2­5 are at the same scale. (B) ICl currents: (B1) the oocyte was voltage clamped at - 35 mV and stepped to +40 mV for 1 s, to - 140 mV for 1 s, then back to - 35 mV. Four recordings are depicted, they were obtained on the same oocyte, before Grb2 microinjection (dotted black line), 10 s after microinjection (black line) which correspond to the peak ICl1-S current, 2 min after microinjection (grey line) and 10 min after microinjection (dotted grey line); (B2) ICl1-S (black line) and ICl2 (grey line) current intensities measured over time in the same oocyte as in B1. The two steps protocol was repeated continuously over time before and after Grb2 microinjection. ICl1-S, the non-inactivating outward current, corresponds to the current intensity measured at the end of the first pulse made at +40 mV. ICl2, the slow inward current, corresponds to the current intensity measured at the end of the second pulse made at - 140 mV. Values are reported in the graph over time. The arrow indicates the time of Grb2 microinjection.

Grb2 appeared to be dependent on the time of removal of the oocytes from the ovaries and the surrounding blood vessels as shown by the absence of Grb2-induced G2/M transition two days after oocyte isolation. The activation required functional SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 [21], therefore a search for partners that could bind the two domain types was conducted. 4.1. The Grb2­lipovitellin 1 association Experiments using cytoplasm transfer, depleted in platelets or not, from day 1 oocytes in day 3 oocytes result in recovery of the oocyte capability to undergo Erk2 phosphorylation and meiosis reinitiation. Cytosol extracts from day 1 and day 3 oocytes were passed through a column of poly-proline beads linked to the SH3 domains of Grb2. It clearly appears that a 100 kDa protein from day 1 extracts is bound to the SH2 domain of Grb2 but not observed either from control beads without Grb2 or from day 3 oocyte extracts. A Western blot analysis reveals the protein to be lipovitellin 1 (LV1). A functional experiment using Xenopus anti-LV1 antibodies in oocytes prior to Grb2 injection demonstrates that LV1 is required for this mechanism as these antibodies block Grb2-induced meiosis reinitiation. In Xenopus, a phosphoglycolipoprotein, the vitellogenin (VTG), is synthesized in liver under the control of estrogen and transported by blood to female gonads. VTG is internalized through a specific receptor (VTGR) and split into lipovitellin 1 (the amino-terminal region), phosvitin (the phosphoseryl-rich domain), and smaller fragments derived from the carboxyterminal region [30,31]. VTG cleavage is initiated prior to its deposition in platelets [32] and its derived products are finally crystallized and stored in the oocytes as vitellus platelets. The time dependent response obtained in oocytes after injection of Grb2 can be understood by the fact that VTG endocytosis from the blood vessels that surround the oocyte and the production of new available LV1 is arrested on the day the oocytes are removed from the ovaries. LV1 is present as a spliced product for Grb2 in the cytosol where it remains uncrystallized only for a day [33]. The accessibility of LV1 for Grb2 in the cytosol is reinforced by the fact that another cytoplasmic protein, calmodulin, was shown to be a partner of LV1 [34]. Analysis by Western blotting of a total extract of oocytes demonstrates that LV1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in day 1 oocytes. LV1 protein sequence includes in its N-terminal several tyrosine residues that could be phosphorylated and particularly a consensus sequence for the binding of Grb2 (pYXNX) [35,36]. The same Grb2 binding consensus sequence is present in the LV1 human homologue, the apolipoprotein B (ApoB), inserted in the circulating low density lipoprotein (LDL) involved in cardiovascular diseases [37­39]. The LDL and ApoB are directly linked to vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation through a Ras/MAPK-dependent cascade [40] and through effectors including phospholipase C [41]. In addition, Grb2 in relation with another member of the apolipoprotein family, the ApoE, is involved in macrophage proliferation and atherosclerosis [42]. Recent evidences also exist in favor of an unusual binding of Grb2 to a soluble

Fig. 13. Schematic model of the molecular mechanism of the atypical association between the tyrosine phosphorylated lipovitellin 1 (LV1-PY), a homologue of the apolipoprotein B, and the three transduction partners: Grb2­ PLC-1­Sos in day 1 oocytes. Tyrosine phosphorylated lipovitellin 1 is available in the cytosol and binds to the SH2 domain of Grb2. This is the starting point of a novel atypical cascade. The N-SH3 domain of Grb2 is linked to a proline-rich sequence of the C2 domain of PLC-1. The SH3 domain of PLC-1 is associated to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Sos. PLC-1 is not tyrosine phosphorylated on Y783 but shows a phospholipase activity (IP3-triggered calcium release). Sos activates the Ras/ERK2 signaling pathway. This entire complex allows the oocyte cell cycle G2/M transition (GVBD) to occur.

G203R always triggered an inward transient current (n = 14; Fig. 12, A4). However, G203R induced both a smaller and a slower inward transient current than the wild type (peak current was - 310 ± 40 nA, the transient lasted for 56 ± 8 s before I-80 stabilization; t-test indicates that these values are significantly different from those of the wild type, p b 0.001 for both the peak intensity and the transient duration). Microinjection of antiPLC-1 antibodies 1 h before Grb2 microinjection in day 1 oocytes prevented the activation of any transient current (n = 13; Fig. 12, A5). With the double step protocol, the microinjection of Grb2 increased the non-inactivating outward current ICl1-S and a slow inward current ICl2 (n = 9, Fig. 12, B1). Continuous recordings of ICl1-S and ICl2 showed that Grb2 microinjection triggered an instantaneous transient increase of both currents associated with oscillations (n = 9, Fig. 12, B2). Thus Grb2 induces an IP3-triggered calcium release from the intracellular stores followed by a slow calcium influx (the capacitative calcium current). All these experiments showed that while PLC-1 is not phosphorylated on Y783, it displays a phospholipase activity and connects to the N-SH3 domain of Grb2 by its C2 region and to the proline-rich region of Sos by its SH3 domain (Fig. 13). 4. Discussion The present paper attempts to dissect the molecular events involved in Grb2-induced cell cycle reinitiation in Xenopus oocytes. Previous experiments led to the conclusion that the initiation of the mechanism was not dependent on any classical tyrosine kinase receptor. In addition, the signal transduced by

proteolytic peptide linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease and to an enhancement of the MAPK/Erk2 activity [43]. 4.2. The Grb2­PLC-1­Sos association Our Grb2 immunoprecipitation experiments clearly demonstrate that in addition to LV1, not only Sos, but also PLC-1, are bound to Grb2. Surprisingly Sos is not directly bound to Grb2 but to PLC-1. The use of the SH3 domain of PLC-1 as competitor reveals that PLC-1 anchorage to Grb2 persists while Sos is totally absent from the immun-complexes. If Sos was effectively bound to Grb2, Sos would stay bound to Grb2. Sos sequence presents a C-terminal region rich in poly-proline (PP) repeats. The competition between a Sos (PP) peptide and the oocyte endogenous Sos results in a lack of Sos binding to PLC-1­Grb2, as did the SH3 domain of PLC-1. PLC-1 shows three regions with PP rich sequence capable of binding the SH3 domain of Grb2. Only the PP peptide issued from the C2 domain was shown to abolish both immunoprecipitation of PLC-1 and Sos with Grb2. Structurally PLC-1 has a Nterminal PH and a split PH domain (P and H) with its two halves flanking the SH2­SH2­SH3 domains, two catalytic regions X and Y and a C2 domain located in the C-terminal region (Fig. 13). In the classical scheme of activation, the two SH2 domains of PLC-1 bind to phosphorylated RTK and PLC-1 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues, including Y783 [44,45]. The C2 domain mediates interactions with Ca2+/ phospholipides [46]. The X and Y domains fold together to create a catalytic site to produce IP3 from PIP2. In day 1 oocytes, antibodies against the phosphorylated Y783 could not detect this phosphorylation of PLC-1, bound to Grb2 and Sos. On the contrary, the antibodies recognize PLC-1 when it is activated by an exogenous tyrosine kinase receptor expressed in oocytes. Moreover, the use of inhibitory antibodies directed against PLC-1 activity [29] blocked the Grb2-induced cell cycle reinitiation. Electrophysiological recordings performed with double electrode voltage clamp technique showed a rapid biphasic inward calcium-dependent chloride current after injection of Grb2 that could be abolished by the anti-PLC-1 antibodies. The calcium-dependent chloride current was described to be specific of the IP3 induced calcium release from the intracellular stores [26,46] and demonstrates that PLC1 displays a phospholipase activity despite its lack of tyrosine phosphorylation on a classical site. The lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC- associated to its phospholipase activity was described in some other somatic cells [13,47,48] and particularly after progesterone treatment in Xenopus oocytes [49]. A lack of PLC-1 tyrosine phosphorylation could be bypassed by a conformational activation through a change induced by the binding of its two tandem SH2 domains, characteristics of this PLC isoenzyme [50­52]. Recently, the SH2 domain of Grb2 was shown to be essential for the lipase activity of PLD2 (phospholipase D2) by hijacking it to subcellular specific compartment [53]. The binding of Grb2 through its SH2 domain to LV1 could mediate such a cellular localization of PLC-1, probably a cortical one, which would favor the proximity of phospholipid substrate (PIP2).

The major binding site of PLC-1 is the N-ter SH3 domain of Grb2, since no binding partners were observed in our experiments, neither when this domain is used as a competitor in co-injection experiments with Grb2, nor with the Grb2 P49L mutant. The Grb2 G203R mutant could bind PLC-1 and Sos and co-injection of the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 with Grb2 did not affect Grb2 binding with PLC-1 and Sos, nor GVBD, showing that this domain is not directly necessary. However electrophysiological results demonstrate a different pattern in the calcium-dependent chloride current triggered by Grb2 WT and Grb2 G203R. Grb2 induced a rapid transient inward chloride current, while Grb2 G203R produced a smaller and slower transient current. In addition, the Grb2 G203R mutant could not induce Erk2 phosphorylation and GVBD [21] while a competitor for this C-terminal SH3 domain allowed the Grb2-induced Erk2 phosphorylation and GVBD. These different responses obtained on electrophysiological records and GVBD could account for a small effect of the C-terminal SH3 domain in the Grb2­PLC-1­Sos complex. G203R mutation both affect the C-terminal SH3 binding site and the SH3­SH3 interface of Grb2, certainly slightly impairing the three dimensional conformation of the protein. A conformational constraint would be differentially fulfilled in the G203R mutant compared to the competition experiment realized with the C-SH3 domain of Grb2 resulting in a lack of Erk2 phosphorylation and GVBD. The C-terminal SH3 domain could stabilize the Grb2­PLC-1 interaction as it is described for the Grb2­Sos interaction in the classical scheme of RTK-induced cell activation [11]. 5. Conclusion Grb2 forms oligomeric clusters vital for intracellular signaling [54]. Even though studies have showed that direct interaction could exist between Grb2 and PLC-1 [13] and between Sos and PLC-1 [16], this is the first evidence of a transduction mechanism in which two regulators of the Ras mitogenic pathway, Grb2 and Sos, are connected by an active effector from the phospholipid dependent-calcium cascade, PLC-1. It is also the first time that Grb2 by the binding of its SH2 domain to an apolipoprotein family member, LV1, triggers signaling cascades. Finally, it cannot be excluded that the non canonical recruitment of the complex Grb2­PLC-1­Sos could interfere with the transduction cascades triggered by RTKs in pathological states such as cancers overexpressing Grb2 or PLC-1, and lipoprotein metabolic diseases.
