A series of 1-aryl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline inhibitors of JNK3 are described. Compounds 20 and 24 are the most potent inhibitors (pIC50 7.3 and 6.9, respectively in a radiometric filter binding assay), with 10- and 1000-fold selectivity over JNK2 and JNK1, respectively, and selectivity within the wider mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family against p38a and ERK2. X-ray crystallography of 16 reveals a highly unusual binding mode where an H-bond acceptor interaction with the hinge region is made by a chloro substituent. Ó 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Protein kinases catalyse the phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine/threonine residues in proteins involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions. Aberrant kinase activity is implicated in many diseases, which makes the inhibition of kinases an attractive target for the pharmaceutical industry.1 The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways comprise a major signaling system used to transduce extracellular signals to intracellular responses. The MAPK family of serinethreonine protein kinases consists of the extracellular-regulated protein kinases (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated kinases (p38 MAPK) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs).2 c-Jun N-terminal kinases are implicated in several disease areas, including neurodegeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory disorders, cancer and diabetes.3,4 They differ in their tissue expression profile and functions, with JNK1 and JNK2 being widely expressed, whereas JNK3 is expressed predominantly in the brain and at lower levels in the heart and testes.5,6 JNK3 appears to play important roles in the brain to mediate neurodegeneration, such as beta amyloid processing, Tau phosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's Disease, as well as the mediation of neurotoxicity in a rodent model of Parkinson's Disease.7­9 Identifying potent inhibitors of JNK3, with selectivity within the wider MAPK family, may contribute towards neuroprotection therapies with reduced

side effect risks and will aid the further understanding of the roles of the individual JNK kinases. Only a few cases of inhibitors with significant selectivity within the JNK family have been published, recent examples being 1­3, Table 1.10­12 JNK inhibitors have been recently reviewed.13

A screening exercise to identify new JNK3 inhibitors identified dihydroisoquinoline 4 as a weakly potent (pIC50 5.0) inhibitor. Searching of the GlaxoSmithKline corporate collection identified numerous closely related analogues. A selection was screened in JNK3 and p38a fluorescence anisotropy kinase binding assays; data are summarised in Table 2.14,15 This initial iteration of analog screening revealed several interesting aspects to the series. Firstly, numerous changes to R1 with methoxy R6 and R7 groups failed to increase JNK3 potency; at best the moderate activity of the initial hit 4 was retained. Changes to the R6 and R7 positions had a moderate impact; compounds 11 and 13 where the 7-position methoxy group was replaced by chloro yielded slight increases in JNK3 inhibitory activity over the initial hit, albeit with different R1 substituents to 4. Interestingly, the analogues where the positions of the methoxy and chloro

substituents are interchanged were inactive at JNK3 (compare 11 with 12, 13 with 14). No inhibition of p38a was observed. Encouraged by the moderate JNK3 activity and the initial indications of selectivity within the MAPK family, representative molecules such as 11 were docked into the active site of JNK3, Figure 1.16 Analysis of the dockings suggested the conserved hydrogenbond from the hinge backbone amide (Met149 in JNK3) was accepted by the dihydroisoquinoline nitrogen, with the R1 aromatic substituent occupying the outer lipophilic region.19 This motif is reminiscent of that seen in the crystal structure of close analogues of 1, where the conserved H-bond is accepted by the indazole N2.10 By contrast, in the dihydroisoquinoline dockings the inner H-bond to the backbone carbonyl (Glu147 in JNK3) is lost, whereas in 1 it is donated by the indazole N1. However, this donor interaction, whilst common, is by no means entirely conserved, and the absence was not taken to contradict the binding mode hypothesis. The substituents at R6 and R7 make few interactions with the site, which suggested that there might be significant opportunities for improving this template. With this binding hypothesis in hand, we initiated an exploration of the template to understand the profile of the molecules

within the wider JNK family, with the aim of improving the JNK3 potency and gaining a clearer understanding of the structure­ activity relationships. Screening of further analogs of the series from the GlaxoSmithKline corporate collection was complemented by synthesis of key molecules, focusing on the R6 and R7 positions. The synthetic route was straightforward; appropriately substituted phenylethylamines 15 were acylated and then cyclised with phosphorous oxychloride, as depicted in Scheme 1. Data for representative compounds from this exercise are summarized in Table 3. The most active JNK3 inhibitors were those bearing methoxy substitution at R6 and chloro substitution at R7, analogues where these two substituents were interchanged were at best weakly active at JNK3 (compare 16, 20, and 24 with 17, 21 and 9 (Table 2), respectively). Gratifyingly, selectivity over p38a was maintained. Mono- or di-substituted phenyl groups at R1 were preferred for JNK3, amongst the most active being meta-bromo or chloro compounds 16 and 24. Comparison of these with the unsubstituted analogue 22 or the meta-fluoro variant 11 indicated that the bulk and lipophilicity imparted by the larger halogens provided favourable interactions in the JNK3 ATP binding active site. Other R1 groups, for example benzyl or alkyl, (27, 28) were not tolerated. JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 inhibitory activities of key compounds 20 and 24 were assessed in analogous radiometric filter binding assays, Table 4.20 Erk-2 data were also obtained, which together with the p38a data already in hand from a fluorescence anisotropy binding assay provides a full picture of selectivity within the wider MAPK family.20 The data revealed a highly encouraging selectivity profile; 20 and 24 have approximately 10 and 1000-fold selectivity for JNK3 over JNK2 and JNK1, respectively.

ity is complemented by selectivity within the wider MAPK family over Erk-2 and p38a, approximately 1000- and 100-fold, respectively. The MAPK selectivity of the template is matched by an encouraging wider selectivity profile. For example 20 and 24 were inactive (pIC50 < 5.0) at numerous kinases, including B-Raf, c-Fms, CDK-2, EGFR, ErbB2, GSK3b, IKK-a, IKK-b, Lck, MLK3, PLK1, Rock1 and SGK1. Intrigued by the clear SAR trends that had emerged, we sought to obtain a ligand-bound crystal structure to aid our understanding. A crystal structure of compound 16 complexed with JNK3 was obtained to 2.4 Å resolution, which revealed a binding mode very different to that expected from the docking experiments (Fig. 2).21 Firstly, contact with the hinge is made by the chloro(methoxy)benzene moiety, not by the dihydroisoquinoline nitrogen. Secondly, the R1 aromatic substituent occupies an `induced-fit' hydrophobic pocket at the rear of the active site, not the outer lipophilic region. The conserved hydrogen-bond with the hinge donor (the backbone NH of Met149) appears to be made by the R7 chlorine atom.19 Such hydrogen bonds with organic halogens as acceptors are rare: however, recent studies utilizing small-molecule crystal-structure database surveys or ab initio calculations have shown that such interactions are genuine, if weaker than `normal' H-bonds to oxygen or nitrogen acceptors.22­24 These interactions have not yet been systematically studied in protein­ligand crystal structures, but have been shown to occur in the PDB.25 The ClÁ Á ÁH distance here is 2.7 Å, the ClÁ Á ÁH­N angle 127° and the HÁ Á ÁCl­C angle 113°.26 These parameters are consistent with those observed in the small-molecule database studies, placing the interaction towards the weaker end of the scale in the classification of Jeffrey.22,23,27

A second interaction made by the chlorine is a contact (3.4 Å) with the backbone carbonyl of Glu147; this `inner' carbonyl accepts an H-bond from ATP and is commonly utilized by kinase inhibitors.17,19 Attractive interactions between halogens, here acting as a Lewis acid, and Lewis bases such as oxygen are termed `halogen bonds'; they are less well known than hydrogen bonds, but have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Smallmolecule crystal-structure database surveys, ab initio calculations and gas-phase studies have shown beyond doubt that such interactions can be attractive and of non-negligible strength.28­32 In addition, recent studies have shown that such interactions occur in protein­ligand crystal structures.32,33 In the present structure the C­ClÁ Á ÁO angle is 163°, which is consistent with the literature data showing that, in a halogen bond, a linear geometry is preferred about the halogen atom.28­30 Calculations show that the electron density around the halogen is anisotropic, meaning the halogen atom has a `crown' of positive electrostatic potential in the direction of the C­Hal bond, surrounded by a band of negative electrostatic potential.24,32,34,35 The positive crown is responsible for `head-on' interactions with electron donors (i.e., halogen bonds), the negative band for `sideon' interactions with proton donors (i.e., hydrogen bonds).22,23,25,36 The polar interactions of the chlorine in this structure illustrate this `amphiphilic' nature of halogens, a property that has also been observed in molecular crystals.24,37 The C@OÁ Á ÁCl angle observed here is 139°, and inspection shows that the chlorine lies close to the plane of the carbonyl. Both these observations are consistent with the interaction being with an oxygen lone pair; it should be noted that this preference is not necessarily very strong.28 Whilst the polar interactions of the R7 chloro substituent with the hinge region described above are interesting, the question of how much they actually contribute to binding remains open. It is likely that binding is driven primarily by contacts with hydrophobic residues (discussed further below), and it might be that the contribution of the polar interactions made by the chlorine to the affinity is minor. However, a precedent for the halogen-mediated interaction of 16 with the hinge can be seen in the complex of 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole 29 with CDK2 (PDB 1P5E).36 Here,

the bromine in the 5-position makes a halogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Glu81, which corresponds to Glu147 of JNK3. This bromine also contacts the conserved donor residue in CDK2 (the backbone NH of Leu83); although the geometry is poor, this might constitute a weak H-bond, similar to that seen with 16.

Replacement of the R7 chlorine of 16 with bromine, fluorine or other groups capable of accepting a hydrogen bond are outside the scope of this communication, but would serve to further probe the importance for inhibition of this substituent. The methoxy substituent at R6 impinges on the outer lipophilic region, and makes contacts with hydrophobic residues there (e.g., Ile70, Leu148 and Ala151).19 Further, it might modulate the electron density on the chlorobenzene moiety, and thus affect the polar interactions discussed above. However, the lack of SAR around this position means these effects require further study. The isoquinoline moiety occupies the adenine-binding region, and makes extensive contacts with the hydrophobic residues surrounding it (e.g., Ile70, Val78, Ala91, Met 146, Val196, and Leu206).19 Additionally, the isoquinoline nitrogen accepts a hydrogen-bond from a water molecule that is also H-bonded to the conserved Lysine (Lys93). The R1 substituent of 16 occupies a lipophilic pocket at the back of the active site that is exposed by the rearrangement of the gatekeeper residue Met146 and is formed mainly by the sidechains of Met146, Ala91, Leu144, Ile124, Leu206 and Lys93 (the lipophilic portion thereof).10­12 In addition to these non-polar contacts, the bromine atom of 16 is in contact with the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Leu144 (3.1 Å) and Ala91 (3.3 Å). These interactions appear to be further examples of the halogen bond; in contrast to the situation described above, however, the halogen in both these cases lies approximately perpendicular to the carbonyl plane, suggesting that the interaction is with the p-electrons of the peptide bond instead of with an oxygen lone pair.32 The importance of these halogen bonds can perhaps be gauged by comparison of the JNK3 potency of compound 16 with that of 25 (Table 3). In the latter the bromine is replaced by a methyl group, and the potency is reduced by $0.7 log units. In addition, the chloro-analogue of 16 (compound 24), which can also presumably make the halogen bonds seen in the crystal structure, shows activity almost a log unit better than 25. If the role of the halogen or methyl in these compounds was purely to enhance the steric complementarity of the R1 substituent to the hydrophobic pocket then this difference might not be expected. The induced-fit pocket contains the only active-site residue that differs between JNK3 and JNK1, Leu144 in the former corresponding to Ile106 in the latter. In common with the rationale postulated for 3 we believe that the significant selectivity exhibited by this series for JNK3 over JNK1 could result from the difference in the shape of the hydrophobic pocket introduced by this change.12 This selectivity rationale assumes that the binding mode observed in JNK3 is conserved in JNK1. Despite the relatively low affinity of these compounds for JNK1 (Table 4), it proved possible to obtain protein­ligand crystal structures of 24 and 26 complexed with JNK1, which both showed the same binding mode as 16 in JNK3.21 Only one residue differs in the active sites of JNK3 and JNK2; Met115 in the former corresponding to Leu77 in the latter. The series has only moderate selectivity for JNK3 over JNK2, indicative of

the fact that this residue is peripheral, and thus would not be expected to significantly impact inhibitor binding. The residues that comprise the induced-fit pocket in JNK3 are largely conserved in p38a, a notable exception being the gatekeeper, which is Thr106 in p38a. Despite these similarities, inspection of the structures of JNK3 with 16 and of comparable p38a crystal structures suggests that there are considerable differences in the shape of the pocket, due to, for example, differences in domain orientation.38 This, alongside the differing gatekeeper and differences in the hinge region, means the lack of p38a activity can be easily understood. The gatekeeper residue in Erk-2 is Gln103, which does not undergo the rearrangement observed for Met146 in JNK3, and this kinase is believed to be relatively insensitive to back-pocket binding ligands.39 The lack of Erk-2 inhibitory activity of 20 and 24 was thus expected. In summary, 1-aryl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolines such as 20 and 24 represent a potent series of JNK3 inhibitors (pIC50 7.3 and 6.9, respectively in a radiometric filter binding assay), with 10- and 1000-fold selectivity over JNK2 and JNK1, respectively, and an encouraging wider kinase selectivity profile. The highly unusual binding mode where the conserved H-bond acceptor interaction with the hinge region is made by the R7 chloro substituent is a key feature of the series, and with this structural information in hand, optimization of the R1 and R6 substituents is a focus for future investigations.

Drops were then equilibrated over a reservoir containing 18% peg3350, 0.1 M sodium Hepes pH7.5) before freezing in mother liquor plus 15% glycerol. A 2.4 Å dataset was collected from a single frozen crystal of Jnk3t/16 on a Mar345 detector mounted on a micromax 007HF rotating anode generator. The crystal structure was refined starting from the coordinates of another Jnk3t complex crystal stucture (pdb code: 2O0U--ligand removed before start of refinement). The deposition code for the Jnk3t/16 complex is 2waj. Crystal structures of 24 and 26 with a similarly truncated version of Jnk1 are virtually identical (Bax et al., unpublished results).

Fluorescence anisotropy is read in Molecular Devices Acquest (excitation 530 nm/emission 580 nm). The error of the assay is estimated as ±0.2 log units, based on the median standard deviation of all compounds which have been tested more than eight times and have a mean pIC50 > 6. p38a Fluorescence anisotropy kinase binding assay data were generated using conditions previously described, see: Barker, M. D.; Hamblin, J. N.; Jones, K. L.; Patel, V. K.; Swanson, S.; Walker, A. L. Int. Patent Appl. WO 05/073232. Alternatively, where indicated, p38a inhibitory activity was determined using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay: Recombinant His-tagged human p38a was activated using 3 lM unactivated p38a incubated in 200 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 625 mM NaCl; 1 mM DTT with 27 nM active MKK6 (Upstate). Biotinylated GST-ATF2 (residues 19­96, 400 nM final), ATP (125 mM final) and MgCl2 (5 mM final) in assay buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT) were added to wells containing 1 ll of various concentrations of compound or DMSO vehicle (3% final) in NUNC 384-well black plates. The reaction was initiated by addition of p38a (100 pM final) to give a total volume of 30 ll. After 120 min incubation (rt), 15 ll of 100 mM EDTA pH 7.4 was added followed by detection reagent (15 ll) in buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% w/v/BSA, 1 mM DTT) containing antiphosphothreonine-ATF2-71 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signalling Technology, Beverly Massachusetts, MA) labelled with W-1024 Eu chelate (Wallac OY, Turku, Finland), and APC-labelled streptavidin (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA). After 60 min further incubation (rt) the ATF-2 phosphorylation was measured using a Packard Discovery plate reader (Perkin­Elmer, Pangbourne, UK) as a ratio of specific 665 nm energy transfer signal to reference Eu 620 nm signal. The public-domain JNK3 crystal structure (PDB accession code 1JNK) was used for docking.17 ATP and water molecules were removed from the PDB file and ligands were docked into the active site using GOLD.18 Xie, X.; Gu, Y.; Fox, T.; Coll, J.
