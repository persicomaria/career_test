KEYWORDS : structural genomics, RNase H, NMR, methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ABBREVIATIONS USED : COG, clusters of orthologous groups; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; RNase H, ribonuclease H; rmsd, root mean square deviation The solution structure of MTH1175, a 124-residue protein from the archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. MTH1175 is part of a family of conserved hypothetical proteins (COG1433) with unknown functions which contains multiple paralogs from all complete archaeal genomes and the archaeal gene-rich bacterium Thermotoga maritima. Sequence similarity indicates this protein family may be related to the nitrogen fixation proteins NifB and NifX. MTH1175 adopts an  /  topology with a single mixed  - sheet, and contains two flexible loops and an unstructured C-terminal tail. The fold resembles that of Ribonuclease H and similar proteins, but differs from these in several respects, and is not likely to have a nuclease activity. INTRODUCTION Several high-throughput, genome-wide surveys of protein structure are currently underway at the pilot project scale. One of these projects is using the sequenced genome of the thermophilic methanogen Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum as a source of targets for structure determination. Several hundred of its genes have been cloned and expressed, and many novel structures have already been determined [1]. The structure of MTH1175 was determined using solution state NMR methods. MTH1175 is an interesting target because 1) it is part of a conserved family of archaeal proteins, COG1433 (Fig. 1), 2) its family contains multiple paralogs (homologous proteins from the same organism resulting from a gene duplication), two of which are domains within larger proteins, and 3) it has no functional annotation and its structure can not be predicted based on sequence comparisons. Because it is a member of a conserved protein family and its structure can not be predicted, MTH1175 is a target which falls within the context of

our phylogenetic approach to target selection in structural genomics [2], which aims to efficiently define new protein sequence-fold relationships. Thus, the presently described effort provides structural information with which to begin understanding the function of MTH1175 and the other proteins in COG1433, and also helps to fill in "fold space" and highlights a new sequence-fold relationship. MATERIALS AND METHODS MTH1175 was cloned, expressed in labeled form containing 15N only or 13C and 15N, and purified as previously described for another M. thermoautotrophicum protein, MTH538 [3]. As with MTH538, it was determined that removal of the 20 residue N-terminal extension (containing a 6X His-tag and proteolytic cleavage site) was not essential for proper folding and behavior of MTH1175. Thus, the species whose structure was actually determined was MTH1175 with a 20 residue N-terminal extension, a

protein of 144 amino acids, though it will be referred to simply as MTH1175. Purified protein was exchanged into NMR buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 10% D2O, pH 6.5) by dialysis or gel-filtration, and concentrated to 2 mM with Centricon-10 concentrators (Millipore). NMR experiments on MTH1175 were conducted at 25 °C. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC [4], HNHA [5,6], and 3D 15N-NOESY-HSQC [4] experiments were conducted on [U-15N]-MTH1175. Three-dimensional HNCACB [7], HNCO [7], CBCA(CO)NNH [7], CBCA(CO)CAHA [8], HCCH-TOCSY [9], HCCTOCSY-NNH [10], CCC-TOCSY-NNH [10-12], and 4D CC-NOESY [13] experiments were conducted on [U-13C, U-15N]-MTH1175. The process for derivation of distance restraints from NOESY data was as previously described [3], except that the HNHA experiment was used to obtain 3JHNH values, which were converted to dihedral restraints [5]. Structure calculations were performed as previously described using XPLOR 3.1 [14]. PROCHECK-NMR [15] was used to analyze the ensemble. The protein structure classification databases SCOP [16], CATH [17], and Dali [18,19] were used to analyze the fold of MTH1175. PSI-BLAST [20] was used for sequence database searching, and CLUSTALW [21] was used to generate multiple sequence alignments. RESULTS Sequence similarity of COG1433 proteins to NifX and NifB proteins A PSI-BLAST search with the amino acid sequence of MT1175 indicated similarity to the COG1433 proteins and some additional archaeal orthologs, as well as the bacterial nitrogen fixation proteins NifX and a Cterminal segment of NifB. The sequence similarity between MTH1175 and NifX or NifB is approximately

20-25% over a span of ~80 residues. Similarity to two archaeal NifX proteins, from M. thermoautotrophicum and Methanococcus maripaludis [22] was also revealed by the PSI-BLAST search (Fig. 1). However, archaeal NifB proteins from M. thermoautotrophicum and Methanococcus jannaschii lack the C-terminal portion of bacterial NifB sequences which is similar to COG1433 proteins and NifX. In a cluster dendrogram (not shown) of the aligned sequences, the expanded COG1433, NifX, and NifB families appear to constitute three distinct, but related, families. The limited sequence similarity between proteins from different families is probably not sufficient to unequivocally call them homologues, without knowing whether they are structurally similar. The cluster dendrogram also indicates that archaeal NifX proteins from M. thermoautotrophicum and M. maripaludis do not clearly fall into any one of these families, in terms of sequence similarity, although the branch point in the dendrogram lies closest to the cluster of NifB sequences. Assignment of spectra, extraction of distance restraints, generation of ensemble of structures Assignments were made for all non-proline backbone C and N atoms between residues 1 and 120, except for proline nitrogens. Backbone carbonyl carbon, and side chain carbon and hydrogen atom assignments were approximately 90% complete over this span. Of 436 total NOE-derived distance restraints extracted, 229 were long range (| i-j | > 4), 184 were medium range or sequential, and 23 were intraresidue. Forty phi dihedral restraints were extracted from the HNHA experiment [5]. Twenty four hours after exchange into D2O (pH 6.5 [corrected], room temperature), 31 peaks remained in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. The slow exchange of these amide protons was presumed to result from hydrogen bonding to backbone carbonyl oxygens in regions of secondary structure. Hydrogen bond

restraints (two restraints per H-bond) for 29 H-bonds were added after preliminary structure calculations revealed probable hydrogen bond acceptors for slowly exchanging amide protons. The ensemble of 20 structures generated with these restraints had an average pairwise rmsd of 1.11 Å for backbone atoms (N, C, C, and O) when all residues from 1 to 112 were used. The rmsd for the same atoms was 0.72 Å when loop residues 8-22 and 44-54 were excluded from this range. All heavy-atom rmsd values for the ensemble were 1.35 Å and 1.30 Å, respectively, over the same ranges of residues. The ensemble is depicted in Fig. 2 as a backbone superposition onto the average structure of residues 1-7, 23-43, and 55-112. PROCHECK-NMR [15] reported that 71% and 25% of the residues in the ensemble were in the most favored and additional allowed regions, respectively, of the Ramachandran plot, leaving 3% in the generously allowed region and 1% in the disallowed region. The ensemble of structures and the set of restraints used to generate the ensemble have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 1EO1. Chemical shifts have been deposited in the BioMagResBank with accession code BMRB-4796. Description of the structure of MTH1175 The structure of MTH1175 consists of a mixed 6stranded -sheet flanked by three -helices, two on one side of the sheet and one on the other (Fig. 3). The -strands are ordered 3-2-1-4-5-6, with -strands 2 and 6 antiparallel to the others. Along the sequence, helices occur between -strands 3 and 4, 4 and 5, and 5 and 6. Thus, the overall ordering of secondary structure elements is 1-2-3-1-4-2-5-3-6. Two large loops are found at one end of the protein, one between 1 and 2, the other between 3 and 1. Other segments connecting secondary structure elements are shorter. The third helix (3) is atypically located in the short loop connecting adjacent antiparallel -strands 5 and 6; -- motifs which form adjacent strands in a -sheet more commonly have the strands oriented parallel to one another. The -sheet wraps around 3 somewhat, which is located on the opposite side of the sheet from 1 and 2. Helices 1 and 2 are bunched together nearer one edge of the -sheet than the other, leaving 1 and 2 more exposed to solvent on that side of the sheet. For the 12-residue span from R113 to the C-terminus, diminished intensities for one-bond amide 1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs and random coil values for C chemical shifts indicate that this region is unstructured. Heteronuclear NOE data also suggest local flexibility in the portions of the two large loops: residues V16, R18, and F20 in the first large loop, and S46 through G52 in the second loop (excepting S50 for which an accurate ratio could not be obtained) have diminished amide 1H15 N heteronuclear NOEs relative to the average for the protein (data not shown). Cross peaks from other hydrogens to these amide protons in the 3D 15NNOESY-HSQC tended to be weaker than usual, and large cross peaks to the water resonance at 4.78 ppm were observed as well, also suggesting a greater level

of internal motion than in other regions of the protein. The fold of MTH1175 resembles the Ribonuclease H fold Manual classification of the fold of MTH1175 using SCOP revealed that the Ribonuclease H (RNase H)-like motif is the only fold which has essentially the same sheet topology as MTH1175. Other characteristics of this motif are only somewhat similar to the fold of MTH1175. The RNase H-like motif contains -helices in equivalent positions along the sequence, but in some cases additional helices are present. In many cases the length and orientation of the most similarly positioned -helices also differ significantly from MTH1175. The length and conformation of the structured portions of the first of the two large loops in MTH1175 is not duplicated in any member of this fold class. In the CATH database of protein topologies, MTH1175 most resembles the HIV reverse transcriptase subunit 1 topology, which is represented by essentially the same set of proteins as the SCOP RNase H-like motif. The structures similar to MTH1175 that were returned by automatic structure similarity searching with Dali confirmed that MTH1175 resembles the fold/topology identified with SCOP and CATH more than any other fold or topology. In SCOP, the fold class known as the Ribonuclease H-like motif contains four superfamilies. These four superfamilies, each named for a constituent protein, are the actin-like ATPase domain, the N-terminal domain of creatinase, the RNase H-like superfamily, and the methylated DNA-protein cysteine methyltransferase domain. A multi-domain protein, eukaryotic peptide chain release factor, also has one domain with the same fold as the RNase H-like motif. Among these superfamilies, the structures in the RNase H-like superfamily itself are qualitatively most similar to MTH1175. This superfamily contains seven families of proteins, making it the largest superfamily in the RNase H-like folding motif. All seven families interact with DNA or DNA/RNA hybrid duplexes and have endo- or exo-nuclease activity. These families, also named for one of their constituent proteins, are ribonuclease H, retroviral integrase, mu transposase core domain, transposase inhibitor (Tn5 transposase), exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase, 3'-5' exonuclease domain of archaeal and phage DNA polymerases, and RuvC resolvase (Holliday junction resolvase). A search of the Dali database of domain folds confirmed that among proteins with the RNase H-like folding motif, the proteins in the RNase H-like superfamily were more similar to MTH1175 than those from the other superfamilies. DISCUSSION Comparative sequence analysis and genomic organization Sequence similarity searches and comparative analysis were used to generate a context for examining the three dimensional structure of MTH1175 (Fig. 4).

MTH1175 is a conserved protein from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum with orthologs from all four sequenced archaeal genomes and the archaeal gene-rich bacterium Thermotoga maritima (Fig. 1). Each species has two or more paralogs and together they form the conserved family, COG1433 [23,24]. In the M. thermoautotrophicum genome, the genes coding for two paralogs, MTH1175 and MTH1177, are clustered with just one intervening gene, and the gene for a third paralog which appears to be a distinct C-terminal domain of a two-domain protein, MTH1172, is also nearby. In Archaeoglobus fulgidus, genes for paralogs AF2377 and AF2378 are adjacent. A. fulgidus also has a third paralog, AF2388, that resembles MTH1172 in its multiple domain character. In both MTH1172 and AF2388, the domain which does not resemble the

COG1433 sequences (denoted MTH1172_1 and AF2388_1) is a predicted transmembrane domain which is part of another conserved family, COG0053. MTH1172 and AF2388 are the only members of this family which contain the additional domain (denoted MTH1172_2 and AF2388_2) which resembles the other sequences in COG1433. Indeed, only one other archaeal sequence is found in COG0053, MJ0449 from M. jannaschii. The other COG0053 sequences are from E. coli, B. subtilis, and yeast; neither they nor the M. jannaschii sequence contain a region which is homologous to MTH1175 or any other sequences in COG1433. The COG0053 sequences are possible homologs of the bacterial protein CzcD, a divalent cation (Co/Zn/Cd) efflux protein that is a transmembrane protein [25].

NMR Structure Determination and Structure-Based Functional Characterization of Conserved Hypothetical Protein MTH1175 from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum

The COG1433 sequences are somewhat similar in sequence to NifB and NifX, proteins involved in nitrogen fixation. The exact biochemical roles of NifB and NifX are not known, but evidence supports a role in biosynthesis of the MoFe cofactor, perhaps as a regulator of this process [22,26,27]. Sequence similarities between NifX and a C-terminal segment of NifB have been noted previously [28]. The sequence similarity between NifX/NifB and the COG1433 proteins, 20-25%, is not sufficient to confidently describe them as homologous, particularly in the absence of structural data. NifB and NifX do not appear to be functionally related to CzcD, and there is no sequence similarity between the N-terminal region of NifB and CzcD. Not all archaeal genomes contain nif or fix nitrogen fixation genes (e.g. the archaeon A. fulgidus, which does not fix nitrogen, lacks them) so it is unlikely that all the COG1433 proteins are involved in regulation of nitrogen fixation. Also, none of the COG1433 proteins is proximal to identified nif genes within their genomes. M. thermoautotrophicum and M. jannaschii, which do fix nitrogen, have clearly identifiable nifB genes. However, no sequence identified in the whole-genome sequencing efforts for these two methanogens was annotated as NifX [29,30], although a GenBank entry (accession no. X87971) for the sequence of a nif gene cluster in M. thermoautotrophicum strain Marburg (instead of strain H, the subject of the genome sequencing effort) includes a nifX gene which overlaps partly with nifN within a cluster of other nif genes. In another methanogenic species, Methanococcus maripaludis, whose genome is currently being sequenced, a nifX gene has been identified and genetically characterized [22]. The closest sequence neighbor of its product is M. thermoautotrophicum NifX. Aside from this similarity, it is no more similar to known (bacterial) NifX sequences than is any protein in COG1433, but it is part of a nif operon containing other nif genes that is organized similarly to the nif gene cluster in M. thermoautotrophicum. No such cluster is evident in the M. jannaschii genome. None of the predicted proteins from the genomes of these methanogens is more similar to any NifX sequence than are those from COG1433. Interestingly, the NifB sequences in M. thermoautotrophicum and M. jannaschii (MTH1871 and MJ1097, respectively) are truncated compared to NifB sequences from nitrogen fixing bacteria and cyanobacteria, such that they lack the C-terminal portion which is similar to NifX, MTH1175, and the other proteins in COG1433. Thus one could speculate that MTH1175 or MTH1177 interacts specifically with MTH1871 as a two-subunit NifB protein (and likewise for MJ0327 and MJ0580). Given that the COG1433 proteins are conserved in archaea, and that multiple paralogs are present, it is likely that these are similar proteins that operate in different processes, perhaps by a common mechanism. In the case of MTH1172_2 and AF2388_2, these might be extramembrane domains involved in the regulation or control of cation efflux. The clustered paralogs in M. thermoautotrophicum and A. fulgidis are also proximal

to and on the same coding strand as a common gene, an ATPase involved in chromosome partitioning (MTH1176 and AF2382); thus these may be involved in regulation of cell division. The other proteins in COG 1433 may be involved in other processes, judging from the multiple paralogous relationships that exist in this COG. Structure-sequence analysis Analysis of the multiple sequence alignment of the COG1433 proteins (Fig. 1) in light of the structure of its component protein MTH1175 allows preliminary identification of conserved features that may be important to the structural stability and/or activity of the protein. One notable feature is that the latter part of the first of the two large loops contains many of the most highly conserved residues (V16, F20, G21, R22, and F26), while the other large loop appears to be the most heterogeneous region of the alignment except for a GAG sequence (residues 52-54 in MTH1175) in the middle of the loop. Two of the conserved residues in the first large loop, V16 and F20 are among those indicated by the heteronuclear NOE data to undergo more rapid internal motion. Aside from the aforementioned first large loop, most of the conserved residues occur in regions of secondary structure and probably help stabilize the fold. Heterogeneities are present at the C-termini of the sequences in COG1433 and the NifX/B family. For example, some of the sequences, including MTH1175, have Gly and Arg-rich regions at their C-termini, while NifB, NifX, and others do not. Additionally, inferring general structural similarity according to the sequence alignment, some sequences--M. maripaludis NifX, AF0668, MTH1172_2, and AF2388_2--appear to terminate prior to the last -strand. Another paralog from A. fulgidis appears to be lacking the first -strand, while MJ0327 is missing a portion of the second large loop. Comparative structure analysis The fold of MTH1175 most closely resembles structures in the SCOP fold class known as the R i b o n u c l e a s e H - l i k e m o t i f . A mo n g t h e f o u r superfamilies within this fold, structures in the Ribonuclease H-like superfamily most closely resemble MTH1175. Three structures within this superfamily are compared to MTH1175 (Fig. 5) in the following discussion: RuvC resolvase (also known as Holliday junction resolvase, pdb code 1HJR) [31], Ribonuclease H (RNase H, 2RN2) [32], and the RNase H domain of HIV reverse transcriptase (1RTH) [33]. RuvC resolvase had the highest Z-score (4.9) in the Dali structure similarity search, where 90 of 158 residues in 1HJR aligned with MTH1175 with a C rmsd of 3.1Å.

In both MTH1175 and the RNase H-like motif, -strands are ordered 3-2-1-4-5 across the sheet, with 2 antiparallel to the rest. However, MTH1175 has a short sixth -strand that is antiparallel to its adjacent strand, 5. None of the structures in the RNase H-like motif

Charged side chains are labeled by residue number and type. A: Surface electrostatic features of MTH1175. The perspective is toward the C-terminal end of the -sheet, as in Fig. 3 (A) and Fig. 5. Blue and red indicate +6.75 kT and ­6.75 kT, respectively. As in Fig. 5, the depiction of the flexible C-terminal tail is only for illustration purposes, in fact the tail is unstructured and samples numerous rapidly interconverting conformations. B: View of MTH1175 following a 180 degree rotation about the y-axis (vertical page axis). C: RuvC Holliday junction specific resolvase (1HJR) [31], from approximately the same perspective shown in Fig. 5. D: Ribonuclease H (2RN2) [32], also from approximately the same perspective shown in Fig. 5. In C and D, arrows point to the negatively charged, divalent cation binding pocket in each protein, and to the "basic protrusion" in RNase H that is involved in binding to DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes.

have this sixth strand. Furthermore, the first of the two large loops in MTH1175 is never duplicated in the RNase H-like motif. Typically, in place of this 17residue loop is a turn containing at most four residues. Substantial differences also occur in the helices. The first helix, 1, has a similar orientation in all four structures, but in MTH1175 it begins later in the loop following 3. The second -helix in RuvC resolvase, though somewhat longer, is oriented similarly to its counterpart in MTH1175. In RNase H itself, a kinked 2 extends away from the -sheet, after which a turn leads into another -helix, here designated 2' for consistency with the labeling in MTH1175, which is oriented more like 2 in MTH1175. In the RNase H domain of HIV reverse transcriptase however, 2 is not kinked, though it still extends away from the -sheet, and there is no equivalent to 2'. In MTH1175 2 is packed against the -sheet and has a minimal number of residues in the turns at each end. The third helix in MTH1175 is oriented quite differently from the equivalent helix in RNase H itself, placing the Cterminal region following this helix at the opposite side of the protein. In RuvC resolvase two short -helices separated by a small turn following 5 lead into a larger, sharper turn and another helix which aligns with 3 in MTH1175. In the RNase H domain of HIV reverse transcriptase, -helix 3 is missing altogether. All of the proteins in the SCOP RNase H superfamily bind nucleic acids (DNA or DNA/RNA hybrid duplexes). Nucleic acid binding proteins often have positively charged regions on their surface which interact with negatively charged phosphate groups on the DNA or RNA backbone. MTH1175 has distinct regions on its surface in which positively and negatively charged side chains on its surface are not evenly dispersed. Two basic regions are apparent (Fig. 6) which contain basic residues (K2, R22, and K88) that are somewhat conserved in the MTH1175 family (Fig. 1). RNase H has a region rich in basic residues, the "basic protrusion", in its 2 region which is believed to interact with DNA/RNA hybrid duplexes [32]. This part of RNase H is near the C-terminus of MTH1175 in the superimposed structures (Fig. 6). A flexible C-terminus that is rich in Arg residues is a feature seen in both MTH1175 (RSPGSGRGRRRR) and some of the proteins in the SCOP RNase H superfamily. For example, RuvC resolvase from E. coli has the sequence MSESRLNLARGRLR at its Cterminus, and this portion of the chain was not found in the diffraction data (and is not shown in Figs. 5 and 6), indicating mobility in this region [31]. No other functional similarities to these proteins could be identified by comparison to the structure of MTH1175, however. Most significantly, MTH1175 and the other proteins in its family lack a conserved group of acidic residues, typically located near a cleft at the C-terminal end of the -sheet, which are involved in divalent cation binding for the nuclease activity of these proteins. While some acidic residues are conserved in this family, the structure shows that they are not clustered. This difference is quite clear in the depiction of electrostatic surface features generated by GRASP; the Mg2+

binding site is visible as a distinct pocket lined with negative charges in both RuvC resolvase and RNase H, while MTH1175 lacks such a pocket (Fig. 6). MTH1175 also lacks histidine residues, which frequently appear in catalytic roles in nucleases. The large loop between 1 and 2 in MTH1175 appears to be unique to this protein. All the structures with the RNase H-like motif have a small loop or hairpin in this portion of the structure, which forms part of one side of the binding cleft containing the divalent cation binding side. Comparing MTH1175 to other SCOP RNase H superfamily members, particularly RuvC resolvase (Fig. 5), the large loop in MTH1175 actually appears to occupy what would be a similar cleft. That some of the most conserved residues in the extended family of proteins with sequence similarity to MTH1175 are found in this portion of the sequence emphasizes the probable functional significance of this structural feature. Structure comparisons between MTH1175 and proteins in the SCOP RNase H superfamily argue against a nuclease role for MTH1175, but do little to suggest what the true biochemical function might be. Conclusion In conclusion, structure determination of MTH1175 from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has revealed a structure with a fold that is similar to the SCOP RNase H-like motif. Within this fold, MTH1175 most resembles the proteins in the RNase H superfamily. The structure of MTH1175 differs distinctly from the structures in this superfamily, however, in that it has fewer and shorter helical segments, a sixth -strand, and a unique large loop (residues 8-22) not seen in any other structure with this fold. This large loop contains residues that are highly conserved in COG1433, and the loop appears as though it occludes a distinct cleft that could be an active site or binding site. Some internal flexibility is likely present in part of this loop and the second loop nearby. Surface electrostatic features are unevenly distributed on the surface and in the flexible C-terminal tail, in a way that is not unlike other nucleic acid binding proteins. However, MTH1175 lacks the conserved features of the nucleases that comprise the SCOP RNase H superfamily, such as the acidic residues that form a Mg2+ binding site and the catalytic histidine.
