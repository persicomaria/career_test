Abstract The murine single-chain variable fragment F8 (scFv(F8)) is endowed with high intrinsic thermodynamic stability and can be functionally expressed in the reducing environment of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasm. The stability and intracellular functionality of this molecule can be ascribed mostly to its framework regions and are essentially independent of the specific sequence and structure of the supported antigenbinding site. Therefore, the scFv(F8) represents a suitable scaffold to construct stable scFv chimeric molecules against different antigens by in vitro evolution or antigen-binding site grafting. Thanks to the favourable pharmacokinetic properties associated to a high thermodynamic stability of antibody fragments, such scFv(F8) variants may be exploited for a wide range of biomedical applications, from in vivo diagnosis to therapy, as well as to interfere with the function of intracellular proteins and pathogens, and for functional genomics studies. However, the potential immunogenicity of the murine framework regions represents a limitation for their exploitation in therapeutic applications. To overcome this limitation, we humanized a derivative of the scFv(F8), the anti-lysozyme scFv(11E), which is endowed with even higher thermodynamic stability than the parent antibody. The humanization was carried out by substituting the framework residues differing from closely related VH and VL domains of human origin with their human counterparts. Site-directed mutagenesis generated the fully humanized product and four intermediate scFvs, which were analyzed for protein expression and antigen binding. We found that the substitution Tyr 90  Phe in the VH domain dramatically reduced the bacterial expression of all mutants. The back-mutation of Phe H90 to Tyr led to the final humanized variant named scFv(H5)H90Tyr. This molecule comprises humanized VH and VL framework regions and is endowed with HEL-binding affinity, stability in human serum and functionality under reducing conditions comparable to the murine cognate antibody. Consequently, the humanized scFv(H5)H90Tyr represents a suitable scaffold onto which new specificities towards antigens of therapeutic interest can be engineered for biomedical applications. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the last 20 years the number of recombinant antibodies (Abs) and Ab fragments aimed at diagnostic and therapeutic applications has been ever increasing (Holliger and Hudson, 2005; Reichert and Valge-Archer, 2007). Single-chain variable domain fragments (scFvs) (Bird et al., 1988) are among the most successful Ab fragments developed until now. They are composed of the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains, encompassing the antigen-binding site (ABS), joined together by adaptable linkers allowing functional expression as a single polypeptide sequence. Main advantages of these fragments over

complete immunoglobulins in therapy are ease of expression and higher rate of tumour uptake and blood clearance. These properties are particularly advantageous in tumour targeting and in vivo imaging, so that a number of scFvs and scFv-containing molecules are now undergoing clinical or pre-clinical studies (Glennie and Johnson, 2000; Holliger and Hudson, 2005). The intrinsic thermodynamic stability of candidate therapeutic Ab fragments is considered to be an important prerequisite for in vivo applications in that it is expected to be associated with favourable pharmacokinetic properties such as high serum half-life (Willuda et al., 1999), as well as with their functionality inside the cell (Koch et al., 2006; Monsellier and Bedouelle, 2006; Proba et al., 1998; Tavladoraki et al., 1999; Worn et al., 2000), where these `intrabodies' can modulate the function of proteins and intracellular pathogens (Liu et al., 2005) or target molecular processes associated with carcinogenesis (Leath et al., 2004). Besides their potential therapeutic applications, intrabodies have raised a considerable interest in other fields such as plant biotechnology (Boonrod et al., 2004; Villani et al., 2005), in vitro functional genomics (Lobato and Rabbitts, 2004) and proteomics (Visintin et al., 2004). Although several intrabodies have been shown to be able to interfere with specific molecular functions taking place inside the cell (Kontermann, 2004), as a general rule scFv fragments cannot fold correctly in the cytoplasm, where they usually form non-functional insoluble aggregates. This is believed to be due to the reducing environment of this milieu (Hwang et al., 1992) that hampers the formation of the disulfide bonds within the core of variable domains (Biocca et al., 1995; Martineau et al., 1998; Tavladoraki et al., 1999). Consequently, a number of approaches have been pursued to isolate Ab fragments endowed with high thermodynamic stability and/or functional in reducing/intracytoplasmic environments. These approaches include evolutionary methods, involving the selection for molecules functional in the cytoplasm or under reducing or denaturing conditions (Auf der Maur et al., 2004; Brockmann et al., 2005; Graff et al., 2004; Jermutus et al., 2001; Koch et al., 2006; Tse et al., 2002) and rational methods, based on the scrutiny of factors involved in stability (Ewert et al., 2003; Hugo et al., 2003; Jung et al., 1999; Monsellier and Bedouelle, 2006; Nieba et al., 1997) or on grafting of binding specificities onto stable scFv scaffolds (Donini et al., 2003; Jung and Pl¨ ckthun, 1997; Krauss et al., 2003; Willuda et al., 1999). Howu ever, at present, only a few murine-derived Ab fragments have proved to possess a particularly high stability in both denaturing and reducing conditions and have been successfully used for intracytoplasmic applications (Proba et al., 1998; Tavladoraki et al., 1993, 1999; Villani et al., 2005; Worn et al., 2000). In combination with a high thermodynamic stability, a fundamental requisite for applications of Ab fragments in human therapy is a low immunogenic potential (Pavlinkova et al., 2001). In fact, most of the recombinant antibodies that reached preclinical or clinical trials are either of human origin or, in case they originated from different animal sources (usually rodent), they have been previously humanized by replacing Ab regions not involved in antigen binding with homologous regions from human antibodies (Co and Queen, 1991; Winter and Harris, 1993; Winter and Milstein, 1991). Even for clinical applications

aimed at intra-cellular antigens, humanized scaffolds would be preferable in case Ab fragments are distributed in the bloodstream before being internalized in the cell compartments. Ab fragments endowed with both high serum and/or thermodynamic stability and low immunogenic potential have been obtained by grafting the ABS from a less stable and/or rodent Ab fragment into one of the few stable human acceptors known to date (Jung and Pl¨ ckthun, 1997; Krauss et al., 2003; Willuda et al., 1999). u We have previously reported that the murine scFv(F8) is endowed with particularly high thermodynamic stability and it is functional in the cytoplasm of both E. coli and plant cells (Tavladoraki et al., 1999). Because of these properties, we exploited the scFv(F8) scaffold for a number of biotechnological applications. A phage-display library of intrabodies has been generated, where 21 ABS residues are mutated or deleted (Desiderio et al., 2001), and shown to be functional under reducing conditions (Villani et al., 2008). In a complementary approach, the same scaffold was rationally engineered in an ABS-grafting experiment, involving >50 mutations, resulting in a chimeric molecule that maintained substantially unaffected stability properties of the cognate Ab (Donini et al., 2003). In this work, our aim was to obtain a variant of the murine scFv(F8) endowed with stability in human serum, functionality under reducing conditions and reduced immunogenic potential. To this end, we humanized the anti-HEL scFv(11E), obtained from the previously reported phage-display library, which has even higher thermodynamic stability than scFv(F8) and whose framework (Fw) regions differ from those of scFv(F8) only for the Asp L64  Gly substitution in the light chain (Desiderio et al., 2001). Additionally, the scFv(11E) has shorter L1 and H3 loops with respect to scFv(F8) and scFvs with short L1 and H3 loops have been shown to be suitable scaffolds for the construction of phage-display libraries endowed with a broad range of antigen specificities (Desiderio et al., 2001). The humanization of Ab fragments is generally carried out either by `ABS grafting', consisting in the replacement of the whole Fw regions of a non-human Ab against a target antigen (ABS donor) with Fw regions from Abs of human origin (ABS acceptors) (Jones et al., 1986; Riechmann et al., 1988; Verhoeyen et al., 1988), or by `resurfacing', where only solvent accessible residues of the non-human Ab are substituted by homologous human residues in the Fw regions (Pedersen et al., 1994; Roguska et al., 1996, 1994). Humanization by resurfacing often results in the maintenance of specificity and binding affinity but it also involves the presence of a higher number of non-human residues that might represent cryptic epitopes contributing to induce an immunogenic response in patients. Conversely, humanization by ABS grafting involves the retention of a smaller number of non-human residues (only those belonging to the ABS) and, therefore, it leads to Abs with lower immunogenic potential than the resurfaced products. However, this procedure often resulted in a decrease in binding affinity, such that a number of back replacements to non-human Fw residues were required to restore high-affinity antigen binding (Carter et al., 1992; Foote and Winter, 1992; Gorman et al., 1991; Tempest et al., 1991). In these experiments the ABS was considered to be formed by the six complementarity determin-

ing regions (CDRs), which had been defined based on sequence analyses (Kabat, 1978; Kabat et al., 1977, 1991). However, from a structural point of view, the ABS is made of six loops (L1, L2 and L3 on the VL and H1, H2 and H3 on the VH ) that are largely, but not completely, overlapping with the CDRs (AlLazikani et al., 1997; Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Chothia et al., 1986, 1989). An essential requisite to maintain Ab specificity and affinity for the antigen is that the six hypervariable loops adopt the correct conformation, or `canonical structure', which is determined both by the length of the loops and by the presence of specific `key-residues', some of which are present in the Fw regions (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997; Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Chothia et al., 1986, 1989; Morea et al., 1998; Shirai et al., 1996; Tramontano et al., 1990). Therefore, together with the six hypervariable loop residues, key-Fw residues that are known to be essential to determine the ABS conformation have to be imported into the humanized Ab for this to maintain the antigen-

binding properties of the ABS-donor Ab (Donini et al., 2003; Foote and Winter, 1992). For our humanization procedure we decided to use the structure-based definition of ABS for several reasons: (i) in known antibody structures loop residues are responsible for the large majority of contacts with the antigen whereas several CDR residues not overlapping with the loops are only rarely involved (Foote and Winter, 1992; MacCallum et al., 1996); (ii) a different specificity has already been successfully grafted into the scFv(F8) Fw regions using the structure-based ABS definition (Donini et al., 2003); (iii) as the structurally defined ABS comprises an inferior number of residues compared to the CDRbased definition (see Fig. 1), based on this definition a reduced number of murine residues are transferred to the humanized Ab; (iv) humanization by loop grafting is expected to produce Abs with lower immunogenic potential than those resulting from `resurfacing' procedures.

(A) Sequence alignment between the VH and VL domains of the murine anti-HEL ABS-donor scFv(11E), the homologous ABS-acceptor domains from antibodies of human origin (PDB identifiers: 1KFA and 1I9R, respectively) and the designed humanized scFv(H5). The structurally defined ABS consists of the six hypervariable loops (H1, H2, H3 in the VH and L1, L2, L3 in the VL ), highlighted by green boxes, and of the key-residues necessary to maintain their conformations (`canonical structures'), coloured red. Fw regions (FW1, FW2, FW3 and FW4) comprise all residues external to the ABS. CDRs (defined based on sequence analyses) are reported for comparison purposes and indicated by blue bars. Residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. (1991) in the Fw regions and to the structural definition by Chothia and co-workers (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997) in the hypervariable loops. The hypervariable loops of the ABS-donor scFv(11E) and the Fw regions of the human ABS acceptors, joined together in the humanized scFv(H5) molecule, are bold. Non-identical Fw residues between the ABS-donor scFv(11E) and the human ABS-acceptor domains VH and VL are indicated by asterisks. ScFv(11E) residues corresponding to those usually found at the VL /VH interface in crystal structures of Ab fragments (Chothia et al., 1985) are grey-shaded. (B) Sequence alignment between the VH and VL domains of the murine anti-HEL ABS-donor scFv(11E), the intermediate scFv products scFv(H1), scFv(H2), scFv(H3) and scFv(H4), and the designed, fully humanized scFv(H5). All scFv fragments have VH ­VL orientation and a (G4 S)3 linker, as well as a carboxy-terminal FLAG tag followed by a hexameric HIS tag. Residue numbering, hypervariable loops, key-residues, CDRs and Fw regions are indicated as in (A). Non-identical Fw residues between scFv(11E) and scFv(H5) are indicated by asterisks. Residues identical to and different from those present in scFv(H5) are bold and highlighted yellow, respectively.

Based on the assumption that variable domains of human origin having high sequence identity with scFv(11E) in the Fw regions would have the same or similar favourable properties, we searched immunoglobulin sequence databases to identify such domains and mutated all Fw residues of scFv(11E) differing from those of human origin into the corresponding human residues. This approach produced the same result as grafting the ABS of the murine anti-HEL scFv(11E) (ABS donor) into the Fw regions of the selected VH and VL domains of human origin (ABS acceptors). We demonstrate that the final humanized version of the murine scFv(11E), named scFv(H5)H90Tyr, which is greatly reduced in immunogenic potential in that it only contains nonhuman residues in the ABS, maintains HEL-binding ability and affinity, stability in human serum and functionality under reducing conditions. Therefore, scFv(H5)H90Tyr represents an ideal scaffold for the development of scFv molecules to be used in human therapy and in vivo diagnosis. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Design of the humanized scFv(11E) We performed sequence database searches to identify human Fw regions having high sequence identity with the anti-HEL scFv(11E) using the NCBI IgBlast tool to search the NCBI human immunoglobulin database and providing the sequences of the scFv(11E) VH and VL Fw regions as queries (see Fig. 1A). Structures of variable domains having high sequence identity with scFv(11E) in the Fw regions were downloaded from the PDB (Berman et al., 2000) and inspected using the software InsightII (Accelrys Inc.) (Dayringer et al., 1986). The humanized scFv(H5) molecule was designed by joining the ABS of the scFv(11E) (ABS donor) to the Fw regions of the selected human ABS acceptors. In our design, we took advantage of the structural definition of ABS by Chothia and Lesk and their co-workers (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997; Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Chothia et al., 1986, 1989; Morea et al., 1998; Shirai et al., 1996; Tramontano et al., 1990) as shown in Fig. 1A. The CDR residues defined by Kabat (Kabat, 1978; Kabat et al., 1977, 1991) that are not overlapping with either hypervariable loops or key-residues were not included in our ABS definition. Throughout the paper we use Kabat's numbering to indicate residues within the Fw regions and Chothia's numbering (AlLazikani et al., 1997) for residues in the ABS, preceded by `L' or `H' according to whether the residue belongs to the VL or VH , respectively. 2.2. Construction of scFv mutants The stepwise mutagenesis of scFv(11E) was carried out using the QuikChangeTM Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For the mutagenesis we used a set of 21 different oligonucleotides (length between 28 and 48 bases), which were designed, according to the manufacturer instructions, to insert targeted codon substitutions in the scFv(11E), as indicated by humanization design. Prior to expression all mutations

were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. All the mutagenized sequences were inserted in the E. coli pDN332 expression vector (Neri et al., 1996) between the pelB leader peptide sequence for periplasmic secretion (Lei et al., 1987) and the FLAG-HIS tag (Neri et al., 1996). All scFvs have a VH ­VL orientation and a (G4 S)3 linker (Bird et al., 1988). The mutagenesis led to the overall construction of 32 individual clones. 2.3. ScFv expression and purification Mutants were expressed in the periplasm of E. coli by shaking for 3 h at 30  C after addition of isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, final concentration 1 mM). Periplasmic extracts were obtained as described in Desiderio et al. (2001), analyzed by reducing SDS-12% (w/v) PAGE and then electrotransferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% skimmed milk in PBS before adding anti-Flag HRP M2 monoclonal Ab (Sigma, 1:2500). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemioluminescence (ECL Plus, GE Healthcare). For the measurement of the relative expression levels of the scFv mutants, periplasmic extracts were normalized for total soluble proteins content and loaded on the gel. Densitometric analysis of the bands in Western blots was performed using the ImageJ v.1.36b software. ScFvs were purified from the periplasmic extracts by immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-NTA columns (QIAgen) according to the manufacturer instructions. Protein purity from eluted fractions was assessed by PAGE-SDS, followed by AgNO3 staining (Merril et al., 1981) and protein concentration was determined from absorbance at 280 nm as in Gill and von Hippel (1989). Gel filtration was carried out at 20  C on a calibrated Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) to isolate the monomeric scFv fraction. Binding specificity was analyzed by ELISA. Immunoplates (Maxisorp Nunc) were coated with HEL (GE Healthcare) (100 g/mL in PBS). Dilutions of the soluble bacterial extracts with an equal volume of PBS with 2% skimmed milk (100 L/well) were incubated over night at 4  C on the coated antigen. Bound scFvs were detected by adding anti-Flag HRP M2 monoclonal Ab (Sigma, 1:2500). 2.4. Affinity determination of the oxidised and reduced scFv(H5)H90Tyr Binding kinetics of the purified scFvs was evaluated by SPR. Real-time interaction analysis was performed using a BIAcore X biosensor system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) instrument essentially as previously described (Dall'Acqua et al., 1996). HEL antigen (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM (w/v) sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was coupled to the dextran matrix of a CM5 sensor chip using Amine Coupling Kit (BIAcore). Approximately 1500 RU of HEL was immobilized. All binding experiments were performed at 25  C in PBS at a flow rate of 20 L/min and pulses of 10 mM HCl were used to regenerate the chip surface. Rate constants were calculated on the basis of a single site model using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore AB). The scFv(H5)H90Tyr was tested under reducing conditions by

2478

adding DTT at a final concentration of 12.5 mM. The redox state was assayed by performing a non-reducing SDS-PAGE as previously described (Tavladoraki et al., 1999). The affinity of the reduced scFv(H5)H90Tyr for HEL was measured in the presence of 12.5 mM DTT following the same procedure described for the oxidised form. 2.5. Epitope-mapping analysis For epitope-mapping studies using SPR, three injections of either scFv(H5)H90Tyr or scFv(11E) were performed on HEL-coated chip to obtain antigen saturation giving a maximal response of about 250 RU. These were followed by injections of 150 nM of scFv(11E) or scFv(H5)H90Tyr, respectively (20 L at a flow rate of 20 L/min). Binding to the saturated chip was then assayed and reported as RU. To investigate whether the HEL epitope recognized by the scFv(H5)H90Tyr and scFv(11E) overlapped with the HEL epitope recognized by scFv(D1.3) and scFv(P3) (Donini et al., 2003), the scFv(P3) was injected at a concentration of 150 nM on the HEL-coated chip previously saturated with three injections of scFv(H5)H90Tyr giving a maximal response of about 100 RU. All experiments were performed at 22  C at a flow rate of 20 L/min. Pulses of 10 mM HCl were used to regenerate the chip surface. 2.6. Serum stability Serum stability was assayed as described before (Krauss et al., 2003). Briefly, periplasmic extracts containing the scFvs (at a concentration of approximately 15 ng/ L) were incubated at 4 or 37  C either in PBS or in 70% human serum for up to 168 h. The scFv binding activity was evaluated at different time points (0, 20, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h for the incubation in PBS; 0, 24, 48, 120, 144 and 168 h for the incubation in human serum) by SPR, injecting 20 L of preincubated periplasmic extract on a HEL-coated chip at a flow rate of 20 L/min. We measured the resonance units (RU) of the bound scFv at each time point and calculated the percentage of activity referring to the RU obtained for binding at T0 . 3. Results 3.1. Design of the humanized scFv(11E) The humanized scFv(11E) was designed by merging the ABS of the scFv(11E) (ABS donor) with the Fw regions of human origin (ABS acceptors) showing the highest sequence identity with the murine Fw regions of scFv(11E). The selected ABS acceptors were the 4-B8(8)/E9 Fab (VH subgroup III, 82% sequence identity with scFv(11E) VH domain) and humanized 5c8 Fab (Vk subgroup III, 85% sequence identity with scFv(11E) VL domain), respectively. For both Fabs a crystallographic structure was available from the PDB (Berman et al., 2000), with identifiers 1KFA ° (resolution = 2.80 A) (Murata et al., 2002) and 1I9R (resolu-

° tion = 3.10 A) (Karpusas et al., 2001), respectively. The high sequence identity between the murine ABS donor scFv(11E) and the selected ABS acceptors of human origin (higher than 80% for both VL and VH Fw regions) has been previously shown to correspond to a high structural conservation (i.e., ° RMSD < 1.0 A) in the core regions of homologous proteins (Chothia and Lesk, 1986). Therefore, the main-chain conformation of the Fw regions of the ABS-donor scFv(11E) and ABS acceptor VL and VH domains is expected to be essentially the same and to be maintained in the fully humanized scFv(H5), comprising the same Fw regions as the ABS-acceptor VL and VH domains. As shown in Fig. 1A, the designed humanized scFv molecule, scFv(H5), contains the Fw regions of the 4-B8(8)/E9 VH and 5c8 VL and the ABS of the donor scFv(11E) molecule. This includes both the structurally defined hypervariable loops L1­L3 and H1­H3, and all key-residues (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997; Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Chothia et al., 1986, 1989; Morea et al., 1998; Shirai et al., 1996; Tramontano et al., 1990) necessary to ensure that the conformation assumed by these loops in the donor scFv(11E) is maintained in the humanized construct. Conversely, CDR residues (Kabat, 1978; Kabat et al., 1977, 1991) not overlapping with the structurally defined hypervariable loops or key-residues, were not included in our ABS definition and were imported from the 4-B8(8)/E9 VH and 5c8 VL Fw regions. The key-residues at positions L29, L95 and H29, affecting the conformation of the L1, L3 and H1 loops, respectively (AlLazikani et al., 1997; Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Chothia et al., 1986, 1989), and those at position H94 and H101, affecting the conformation of the H3 loop (Morea et al., 1998; Shirai et al., 1996), are comprised within the hypervariable loops L1, L3, H1 and H3, respectively, and consequently are transferred to the fully humanized scFv(H5) together with these loops. The key-residue at position H71 (see Fig. 1A), comprised within the third Fw region of the VH domain and affecting the conformation of the H1 and H2 loops (Tramontano et al., 1990), is conserved (Arg) between scFv(11E) and the acceptor human Fw (4-B8(8)/E9 VH ), and it is imported to the scFv(H5) together with the third Fw region of the 4-B8(8)/E9 VH domain. The keyresidue at position L90 (see Fig. 1A), comprised within the third Fw region of the VL domain and affecting the conformation of the L3 loop (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997; Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Chothia et al., 1986, 1989) is Gln in scFv(11E) and His in the human acceptor Fw (5c8 VL ). However, we imported the His residue present in the acceptor 5c8 VL domain into the scFv(H5), since it has been shown that Gln and His residues at position L90 are both compatible with the same canonical structure of the L3 loop (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997; Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Chothia et al., 1986, 1989). 3.2. Construction and analysis of the humanized scFv The designed scFv(H5) sequence was obtained by stepwise mutagenesis of the scFv(11E) Fw regions. The mutagenesis and cloning strategy led to the generation of four intermediate scFv products named scFv(H1), scFv(H2), scFv(H3) and scFv(H4), as well as to the fully humanized scFv(H5) (Fig. 1B).

(A) Soluble periplasmic expression of the four intermediate clones scFv(H1)­(H4) and of the fully humanized scFv(H5). Extracts were normalized for total protein content and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Relative expression levels of the analyzed clones were determined by densitometric analysis of three independent Western blot results. Values reported in the tables represent the mean of three independent experiments with standard deviations. The scFv(11E) value was arbitrarily set to 1. Twenty nanograms of purified scFv(11E) were used as a positive control (C+), while untransformed E. coli HB2151 periplasmic extract was used as a negative control (C-). (B) HEL-binding activity of the scFv(11E), scFv(H1) and scFv(H5) periplasmic extracts were assayed by ELISA as described in Section 2. Reported absorbance values were obtained after 30 min incubation. Extracts from untransformed E. coli HB2151 cells were used as a negative control.

Extracts were normalized for total protein content and relative expression levels were determined by densitometric analysis of three independent Western blot results. Twenty nanograms of purified scFv(11E) were used as a positive control (C+).

All scFv variants were analyzed for expression yields in a soluble form in the periplasm of E. coli. As shown in Fig. 2A, only scFv(H1) showed expression levels similar to those observed for scFv(11E), while clones scFv(H2), scFv(H3), scFv(H4) and scFv(H5) showed expression yields 4­13 times lower. Furthermore in these clones cell lysis phenomena were observed during over expression. ScFv(H1) and scFv(H5) were purified from the periplasmic extract to further appraise their biochemical properties. Purification yields for scFv(H5) proved to be very low (i.e., about 30­40 g/L bacterial culture) while for scFv(H1) they were in the same range as scFv(11E) (about 1 mg/L). Functional analysis of the periplasmic extracts of scFv(H1) and scFv(H5) using ELISA showed that both had a specific binding activity for HEL (Fig. 2B). 3.3. Effects of a single mutation in the humanized scFv(H5) on the soluble expression levels To identify residues potentially responsible for the reduction in expression levels between scFv(H1) and scFv(H2), we analyzed the expression profile of five mutagenesis intermediates between these two molecules. As shown in Fig. 2C, expression levels of the mutagenesis intermediates decrease about 3­8fold compared to scFv(H1), with the exception of scFv(H2.1). This mutagenesis intermediate differs from scFv(H1) by only two residues (see Table 1), while having comparable expression

levels. Comparison of the amino acid substitutions occurring between all the scFv intermediates reported in Table 1 showed that all clones had Phe in position H90, except for scFv(H2.1) that maintained the original Tyr residue. Therefore, we investigated the role of the residue occurring at position H90 on the expression levels of soluble scFv molecules. To this aim, we constructed a panel of mutants. In scFv(H2) and scFv(H5), showing low expression levels, we mutated Phe H90 to Tyr, obtaining scFv(H2)H90Tyr and scFv(H5)H90Tyr, respectively. In scFv(11E) and scFv(H1), showing high expression levels, we mutated Tyr H90 to Phe, obtaining scFv(11E)H90Phe and scFv(H1)H90Phe, respectively. The results of the expression

constants were 2.83 × 104 M-1 s-1 and 2.71 × 10-3 s-1 , giving a KD = 96 nM, essentially the same as that calculated for the non-reduced form (Table 2). 3.5. Epitope mapping of the scFv(H5)H90Tyr To ascertain whether the HEL epitope recognized by scFv(H5)H90Tyr overlaps with that recognized by the cognate scFv(11E), competition studies were performed using SPR. Saturating amounts of scFv(11E) were injected on a HELcoated chip (saturated with approximately 250 RU) and the scFv(H5)H90Tyr was assayed for binding (a typical sensorgram is shown in Fig. 4, left panel). In a parallel experiment, saturating amounts of scFv(H5)H90Tyr were injected on a HEL-coated chip and scFv(11E) binding was assayed (data not shown). In neither experiment binding to the saturated chip was observed, indicating that the epitopes of scFv(H5)H90Tyr and scFv(11E) are largely overlapping. A second experiment was set up to validate this result using the previously reported scFv(P3), which recognizes the same HEL-epitope as the model anti-HEL scFv(D1.3) (Donini et al., 2003). Saturation of a HELcoated chip with the scFv(H5)H90Tyr did not hamper binding of the scFv(P3) to HEL (110 RU) (Fig. 4, right panel), indicating that the HEL epitope recognized by scFv(H5)H90Tyr (and scFv(11E)) differs from that recognized by scFv(P3) (and scFv(D1.3)). 3.6. Serum stability of the humanized scFv For clinical applications recombinant antibodies must be resistant towards human serum proteases and retain their activity

levels of these mutants in the periplasm of E. coli are summarized in Fig. 3. ScFv(H2)H90Tyr and scFv(H5)H90Tyr showed 9- and 3.4-fold increase in the expression levels compared to the original scFv(H2) and scFv(H5), respectively. On the contrary, scFv(11E)H90Phe and scFv(H1)H90Phe showed 2.6- and 3.3-fold decrease compared to scFv(11E) and scFv(H1), respectively. The purification yield of scFv(H2)H90Tyr was about 600 g/L bacterial culture, and the yield of scFv(H5)H90Tyr about 450 g/L bacterial culture (more than 10-fold higher than that of scFv(H5)). 3.4. Affinity measurements of the humanized scFv(H5)H90Tyr Binding activity of the humanized scFv(H5)H90Tyr for HEL was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The calculated association and dissociation rate constants were 1.45 × 104 M-1 s-1 and 1.05 × 10-3 s-1 , respectively, giving a KD = 72 nM (Table 2), similar to, and even better than, that measured for the cognate scFv(11E) (KD = 105 nM) (Desiderio et al., 2001). The binding activity of the reduced scFv(H5)H90Tyr was also calculated by SPR. The scFv was subjected to strongly reducing conditions (DTT 12.5 mM) and its reduced state was confirmed by gel-shift assay on a non-reducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The calculated association and dissociation rate

In the left panel is reported the sensorgram obtained after three injections of saturating amounts of scFv(11E) on HEL-coated chip followed by the injection of scFv(H5)H90Tyr on the same chip. The absence of scFv(H5)H90Tyr binding indicates that scFv(11E) and scFv(H5)H90Tyr recognize overlapping epitopes. The red line refers to the binding (100 RU) of scFv(H5)H90Tyr on a non-saturated chip as a control. In the right panel is reported the sensorgram obtained after three saturating injections of scFv(H5)H90Tyr on a HEL-coated chip followed by an injection of the anti-HEL scFv(P3). Binding of scFv(P3) (110 RU) indicates that scFv(H5)H90Tyr and scFv(P3) recognize different epitopes.

Fig. 5. Stability of the final humanized scFv(H5)H90Tyr, scFv(11E) and scFv(D1.3) in serum and PBS. The scFvs were incubated at 4 and 37  C for various time periods (up to 168 h) either in PBS (A) or in human serum (B). Antigen-binding activity (RU) was determined by SPR on a HEL-coated chip. Residual activity was determined at each time point as follows: RU of the scFv sample treated with PBS or human serum at 37 or 4  C/RU of the scFv at T0 .

at 37  C. We assessed the stability of the scFv(H5)H90Tyr by measuring its binding to HEL by SPR after incubation at 37  C in human serum or in PBS, as reported in Krauss et al. (2003), at various time intervals. As reference molecules we used the scFv(11E), previously shown to be endowed with high thermodynamic stability (Desiderio et al., 2001), and the scFv(D1.3) having an average stability for an scFv fragment (Monsellier and Bedouelle, 2005). As shown in Fig. 5, scFv(11E) retained 90% and 65% of its binding activity when incubated for 7 days at 37  C in PBS (panel A) and in human serum (panel B), respectively, whereas scFv(D1.3) lost more than 90% of its activity after just 1 day of incubation at 37  C in both conditions. The scFv(H5)H90Tyr retained 66% of its binding activity after 7 days incubation at 37  C both in PBS (Fig. 5A) and in human serum (Fig. 5B), indicating that its stability in human serum is essentially the same as that of the parent scFv(11E). 4. Discussion Due to their ability to recognize virtually any antigen with high affinity, Ab-based molecules are invaluable tools for biotechnological applications and research studies and have theoretically unlimited potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. A high intrinsic thermodynamic stability is considered to be an essential requisite of Ab fragments for many practical purposes, since it has been shown to correlate with serum stability or the ability to be functional under reducing conditions, which is required to neutralize intracellular and, in particular, cytoplasmic factors responsible for disease. We previously demonstrated that the murine scFv(F8) and scFv(11E) are endowed with high thermodynamic stability and cytoplasmic functionality, and that these properties are indepen-

dent of the ABS supported by their Fw regions. In this work, we humanized the scFv(11E) molecule to obtain a modified scaffold having both serum stability properties similar to the cognate molecule and a lower immunogenic potential, hence amenable for human therapy and in vivo diagnosis. Our starting hypothesis was that VL and VH domains of human origin whose Fw regions had high sequence identity with the murine scFv(11E) were likely to possess the same favourable properties as the scFv(11E) scaffold. Based on this assumption, we searched a database of human antibody sequences for VL and VH Fw regions with high sequence identity to the scFv(11E) and designed a chimeric molecule, namely scFv(H5), containing the selected Fw regions (ABS acceptors) and the ABS of the scFv(11E) (ABS donor). The designed molecule was produced by stepwise mutagenesis and shown to retain highaffinity HEL-binding. However, the yield of purified protein was about 30-fold lower if compared to that of scFv(11E). Scrutiny of the sequences of the intermediate mutagenesis products suggested that a single-point mutation (Tyr H90  Phe in the heavy chain) could have been responsible for the significant reduction in expression levels, in particular in the transition from scFv(H1) to scFv(H2). Indeed, analysis of four additional point-mutants, the first two bearing the Tyr H90  Phe substitution (scFv(11E)H90Phe and scFv(H1)H90Phe) and the others the Phe H90  Tyr back-mutation (scFv(H2)H90Tyr and scFv(H5)H90Tyr), confirmed this hypothesis and led to the final humanized product scFv(H5)H90Tyr, whose purification yield was roughly halved if compared to that of scFv(11E). Analysis of the properties of the humanized scFv(H5)H90Tyr showed that this molecule fulfils all the initial requirements. In fact, HEL-binding affinity assayed in vitro by SPR analysis was essentially the same as that of the murine ABS donor scFv(11E)

both under oxidizing and reducing conditions. Additionally, like the highly stable scFv(11E), the scFv(H5)H90Tyr retains 66% of the HEL-binding activity after several days incubation in human serum in vitro at 37  C. Moreover, the final construct contains Fw regions of human origin and, therefore, it is expected to have substantially reduced immunogenic properties with respect to the murine scFv(11E). The ability of the designed scFv(H5)H90Tyr to recognize and bind the same HEL epitope and with the same affinity as that of the parent scFv(11E), demonstrates that ABS-grafting procedures based on a structural definition of ABS (implying the transfer of the six hypervariable loops together with the `key-residues' determining their main-chain conformations or `canonical structures') are in general more effective than `classic' sequence-based strategies. In fact, these are generally based in the transfer of the six CDRs, which do not include all the residues of key-structural importance, often resulting in non-functional Abs which require additional rounds of mutagenesis to acquire a novel specificity (Carter et al., 1992; Foote and Winter, 1992; Gorman et al., 1991; Queen et al., 1989; Riechmann et al., 1988; Tempest et al., 1991). The success of the structure-based grafting procedure also proves that grafting of CDR residues not overlapping with the structurally defined ABS, as performed in some grafting experiments (Jung and Pl¨ ckthun, 1997; Krauss et al., 2003; Willuda et al., 1999), is u not a necessary requirement. Therefore, these residues can be imported from the human ABS acceptors thus minimizing the immunogenic potential of the humanized Abs. Indeed, similarly to what shown in previous experiments (Donini et al., 2003), the scFv(H5), designed on the basis of the structural ABS definition, was already capable of HEL binding and the single mutation Phe H90  Tyr introduced to obtain the final scFv(H5)H90Tyr was only necessary to increase expression levels, not regain specificity. By appropriate structure-based grafting procedures, the scFv(H5)H90Tyr can, therefore, be tailored to recognize any antigen for which the sequence of the variable domains of a binding Ab is known. The fact that the scFv(H5)H90Tyr molecule, including humanized Fw regions having high sequence identity with the murine anti-HEL scFv(11E), has similar properties to the murine parent (i.e., serum stability and functionality under reducing conditions) indicates that this scaffold tolerates not only replacements in the ABS but also extensive mutations in the Fw regions (15 and 16 residues in the VL and VH domain, respectively). While several of these mutations were rather conservative (e.g. Ser L10  Thr; Gln L17  Glu; Asp H42  Glu; Lys H43  Arg and Ile H69  Val), a few involved replacements with residues having very different physico-chemical properties (e.g. Glu L3  Val; Gln H3  Met; Gln H5  Val and Tyr H79  Asn) and might have been expected to negatively affect the stability of the scFv(11E) scaffold. Even mutations occurring at the VL /VH interface (Chothia et al., 1985) (i.e. Gln L90  His; Leu H47  Trp and Thr H108  Ser) did not cause structural changes of the Ab scaffold able to interfere with antigen binding. Interestingly, the single-point mutation Phe H90  Tyr determined a significant drop in scFv expression levels. Based on amino acid substitution matrices (Dayhoff et al., 1978; Henikoff

and Henikoff, 1992), this mutation appears to be rather conservative. However, due to the presence of the side-chain hydroxyl group in Tyr residues, the physico-chemical properties of Tyr and Phe are not as similar as it might be suggested by their high frequency of inter-conversion in protein families. Indeed, according to a classification of residues based on both hydrophobicity and distribution between protein surface and interior, Tyr and Phe are placed into different (`neutral' and `hydrophobic', respectively) groups (Chothia et al., 1998). A detailed analysis of antibody variable domains performed by Chothia and coworkers (Chothia et al., 1998) showed that Tyr H90 is highly conserved in both sequence and structure: position H90 is one of the 76 `conserved core' residues, having the same main-chain conformation in variable domain structures. Additionally, analysis of residue frequencies at these 76 sites showed that position H90 is one of the nine `invariant' sites (positions occupied by a single residue in almost all sequences). In particular, position H90 is occupied by Tyr in about 99% and by Phe in less than 0.6% of over 5300 expressed sequences in the Kabat database

(Kabat et al., 1991). From a structural point of view, the invariant Tyr H90 in the F strand is fully buried at the interface between the two -sheets packed face-to-face and establishes a number of conserved interactions with neighbouring residues both within the same (A GFCC ) and the opposite (ABED) -sheet (Chothia et al., 1998). In particular, the Tyr hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to buried polar atoms of other highly conserved residues, namely the side-chain of Arg/Lys H38 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of the invariant Asp H86 (Fig. 6A), contributing to stabilize them. In VH domains having Phe H90 these stabilizing hydrogen bond interactions are not present (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the hydrogen bond between the -sheet residue Tyr H90 and the main-chain polar atom of residue H86 represents an example of the so-called "Tyr corner", a conformation occurring frequently in Greek key structures and proposed to contribute to their stability and folding (Hemmingsen et al., 1994). All of the above indicate that Tyr H90 is likely to play a key role in the maintenance of the VH structure such that the negative effect of the Tyr H90  Phe substitution on the soluble expression levels of scFv(H2) and scFv(H5) might be explained in terms of a destabilization of the native structure of the VH domain, leading to a shift in the folding equilibrium towards partially unfolded species and to the formation of insoluble aggregates. In conclusion, the scFv(H5)H90Tyr scaffold obtained in this work represents an ideal candidate to produce chimeric scFv molecules for extra- and intra-cellular applications in human therapy and in vivo diagnosis, by either evolutionary methods or rationally designed ABS grafting.
