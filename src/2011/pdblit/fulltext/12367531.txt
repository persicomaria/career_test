A comparison of two methods of generation of C4d (the degradation product of complement component C4) and a method for the preparation of an enriched serum fraction of this fragment are presented.

INTRODUCTION

The activation and degradation of complement component C4 by natural enzymes is now fairly well documented. The 3-chain molecule is activated by Cls which cleaves a 10,000 molecular weight fragment, C4a from the chain. The residual fragment, C4b, is subsequently degraded by C3b Inactivator in the presence of the C3b-C4b Inactivator Cofactor (Shiraishi and Stroud, 1975; Nagasawa et al., 1976; Nagasawa and Stroud, 1977). Two fragments are produced, C4d, a fragment of the a' chain and C4c which consists of the residual ~' chain and the intact ~ and 7 chains. The C4d fragment has an anionic electrophoretic mobility at pH 8.6 and a molecular weight of 50--55,000 both in whole serum incubated with Cls or when generated by degradation of purified C4 by natural enzymes (Shiraishi and Stroud, 1975; Nagasawa et al., 1976). A recent report, supporting identity between different variants of C4 (and possibly C4d) and the Chido and Rodgers blood groups (O'Neill et al., 1978) prompted us to publish a comparison of two methods for the generation of C4d in whole serum and a convenient procedure for the enrichment of C4dcontaining fractions of serum. This material provides a useful starting point for further study of the relationship of C4d to Chido and Rodgers blood groups and will aid the clinical measurement of C4 destruction. In addition, isoelectric points for C4d variants determined using this fraction are presented.

324 METHODS Normal outdated blood was obtained from the Blood Bank at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. Serum was obtained by adding 10 mM calcium chloride to the plasma and incubating at 37°C for 15 min. Lipids and fibrin clots were removed by centrifugation followed b y passage through glass wool. Assay for C4d C4d was detected and quantitated using a goat antiserum to C4d described in Perrin et al. (1975). Samples were mixed with 1 vol of 24% w/v polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) in" 0.1 M borate buffer with 0.01 M EDTA pH 8.3 (Perrin et al., 1975) and incubated at 0°C for 30 min. The separations were analyzed either by Ouchterlony double diffusion or radial immunodiffusion (RID) in 1% agarose in veronal acetate buffer. The RID plates were calibrated using a standard solution of C4d generated in fresh serum by incubation with aggregated human gamma-globulin. Larger C4 derivatives were precipitated with PEG 6000 as described above. The undiluted supernatant of this pool was defined as containing 100 units C4d/ml. Immunoelectrophoresis was carried o u t in 1% agarose using veronal acetate buffer with 0.01 M EDTA pH 8.6. Generation o f C4d in whole serum Two methods were used. Outdated serum was incubated with 5 mg/ml washed, aggregated human gamma-globulin (aggHGG) (Sigma: Cohn fraction 2) for 60 min at 37°C and centrifuged. The aggregates were prepared by dissolving the IgG globulin in saline to 50 mg/ml and heating at 63°C for 12 min. Alternatively, outdated serum was aged at 37°C for 5 days in the presence of 0.05% sodium azide (Mandle et al., 1977). Aged serum was stored at --20 ° C. Preparation o f Cibacron blue affinity resin The m e t h o d used was a modification of Travis et al. (1976). Cibacron blue F 3 G A dye (Polysciences Incorporated) was conjugated with Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia) cross-linked with epichlorohydrin (Porath et al., 1971). Initial dye concentration was 10 mg/ml of gel. Hydrolysis of conjugated gel with 50% v/v acetic acid showed a final concentration of 3.3 mg dye/ml gel. Isoelectric focussing Analytic isoelectric focussing (IEF) was carried o u t in 5% polyacrylamide slabs using a LKB Multiphor apparatus. 2% w/v pH 3.5--5.0 range ampholytes (LKB) were e m p l o y e d with 0.02 M phosphoric acid as the anolyte and 1 M glycine as the catholyte. 0.05% w/v b r o m o p h e n o l blue then was added to the catholyte to check for even field distribution. Full size plates were prerun for 20 min at 35 W before the samples of up to 100 pl were applied

using rectangular section glass rings placed on the gel. Plates were then focussed for 2.5 h at 35 W, 20 min at 40 W. Half-size plates were run for the same time periods at 40% of the power. The plate was maintained at 0 ° C. The acrylamide was stained with 0.03% Brilliant Blue R (Sigma) in methanol--acetic acid--water (1 : 5 : 5) for 24 h. The pH gradient was determined using 1 cm sections cut from the plate beside critical sample channels and eluted with 1.0 ml deionized water overnight. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis 1 mm thick agarose plates (8 cm X 20 cm) in veronal-acetate buffer with 0.01 M EDTA pH 8.6 were prepared on precoated glass sheets. The agarose contained anti-C4d antibody at a concentration designed to give peaks no more than 1.0--1.5 cm high, in order to minimize lateral diffusion. On completion o f an IEF run, strips 8 or 9 cm b y 0.5 cm were removed from the plate, carefully transferred to troughs cut in the agarose plate and sealed in with agarose. The plates were then electrophoresed at 90 ° to the longitudinal axis of the strip at 10 W for 1 h followed by 50 W for 18 h. The plate was maintained at 0 ° C. After electrophoresis, the plates were washed twice with saline containing 1% PEG 6000 then deionized water, dried at 37°C and stained with Millipore dichrome stain.

Time course o f generation o f C4d by aging Two pools of serum containing 0.05% sodium azide were incubated at 37°C and aliquots removed at days 0, 1, 3 and 5. The aliquots were frozen at --20°C before analysis by RID (Fig. 3). A gradual increase was seen from day 1 onwards. Preparation o f an enriched fraction o f C4d from serum Pools of aged serum were applied batchwise to Cibacron Blue-Sepharose 6B (CB Sepharose) equilibrated in 0.1 M Tris, 0.5 M NaC1 (pH 8.0). 125 ml serum was drained into a bed of a b o u t 500 ml and allowed to equilibrate for a b o u t 5 min. The bed was then eluted with the starting buffer and the first 1000 ml collected. This was concentrated using an Amicon PM 10 membrane to 25--40 ml. The bed was recycled b y washing with 1 liter of 0.2 M potassium thiocyanate in 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 8.0 followed by 2 liters of starting buffer. Recoveries of HSA and C4d in the breakthrough fractions measured by RID after fractionation with 12% PEG 6000 are shown in Table 2. Concentrations are corrected to the starting volume of the serum. Isolation of C4d from the other C4 fragments b y precipitation with PEG 6000, as described in methods, resulted in a 9.2-fold purification of the fragment. Determination o f the isoelectric point o f C4d The C4d enriched fraction prepared as above was mixed with 1 vol PEG 6000 in 0.1 M borate buffer with 0.01 M EDTA pH 8.2 at 0°C and incubated for 30 min at 0°C to precipitate C4c and any residual C4 and C4b.

supernatant was dialyzed against 2 changes of 1% w/v glycine and reconcentrated to regain the 3--5-fold enrichment of C4d. Samples in the range of 50--75 pl were used for IEF followed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. A preliminary series of experiments suggested the possibility of 3 variants of C4d with isoelectric points of pH 4.2, pH 4.4 and pH 4.5. However, there was substantial batch to batch variation in the relative proportions of these forms. Two typical patterns are illustrated in Fig. 4.
DISCUSSION

The purpose of this paper is to present and compare methods for the generation and partial purification of C4d from human C4 serum so that it may be characterized in greater detail. Its precise relationship to the Chido and Rodgers blood groups may be further elucidated with this preparation. Of the t w o methods of C4d generation used, aging over 5 days seems to be more efficient, producing on the average twice the a m o u n t of C4d compared with aggHGG-treated serum. The reasons for this are n o t obvious except that the aggregates m a y bind some of the C4d. Since Patrick et al. (1973) and Shiraishi and Stroud (1975) showed that C4 could bind to immobilized human IgG, perhaps some remains b o u n d to the aggHGG. The fragment generated by aging is on the basis of IEP data similar to that described by Perrin et al. (1975) and that generated from purified C4 using C l s and C3b Ina and C3b, C4b-Ina cofactor (Nagasawa et al., 1976). It is also precipitated b y an anti-C4d generated from the p r o d u c t of this last reaction (unpublished data). This would suggest that C4d is generally stable to degradation by proteolytic enzymes in serum, possibly analogous to the final plasmin-insensitive form of C3d (Nagasawa and Stroud, 1977). Michael et al. (1976) report finding C4d on erythrocytes which is trypsin-insensitive although this may reflect the nature of its absorption into the membrane in the manner of the C5b67 complex (Hammer et al., 1975). Preliminary data from crossed immunoelectrophoresis experiments sug-

329 gested that C4d may exist in 3 forms with isoelectric points at pH 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5. Although precise characterization of these fragments is uncertain because of the limitations of the technique, other published data demonstrating heterogeneity in C4 suggest the possibility that such variants could exist in C4d (Rosenfeld et al., 1969; Nagasawa et al., 1976; Tiesberg et al., 1977). Degradation of purified C4 b y C3bINA and the C3bC4b Inactivator Cofactor produced results that suggested that some of the heterogeneity may lie in the C4d fragment (Nagasawa and Stroud, unpublished data). This is borne o u t b y the length of the precipitin arc of C4d on IEP. Alternatively C4d might exist in several catabolic forms analogous to the plasmin degradation of C3d, to C3d2 (Nagasawa and Stroud, 1977). However, the substantial variation in the relative proportions of the fragments between batches and the limited resolution of the experimental system leaves this question unresolved. The procedure for enrichment of C4d in aged serum reported here allows a 4--5-fold concentration of the fragment. Coupled with the PEG 6000 fractionation, it is a very simple m e t h o d for preparation of a serum fraction with a 9.2-fold purification of C4d and which does n o t contain the other C4 fragments. Moreover, there is a 250-fold enrichment of C4d relative to albumin which is important because of the electrophoretic and molecular weight similarities between them. The high losses of C4d on the CB-Sepharose were unexpected as a recent report on enrichment of ~ fetoprotein shows 98% recovery of this molecule {Young and Webb, 1978). The simplest explanation is that C4d and albumin can complex although we have found no direct evidence to support this. We noted that some C4d antigen could be eluted along with the albumin from the CB-Sepharose with 0.2 M potassium thiocyanate. The principal interest of this work is its potential application to work on the Chido CCh) and Rodgers (Rg) blood groups. These two blood antibody specificities have been shown to react with serum as well as a red cell antigen (Middleton and Crookston, 1972; Longster and Giles, 1976). Recently a relationship between C4 variants and the Chido and Rodgers antigens has been demonstrated (O'Neill et al., 1978) where C4F-type homozygous individuals are Ch (a--) Rg (a+) while.the C4S-type homozygotes are CH (a+) Rg Ca-). Both C4 and Chido and Rodgers antigens are limited to the same specificities in the HLA. The previously unobserved Ch Ca--) Rg Ca--) genotype was found when a known homozygous C4 deficient patient was tested. It has also been shown that Chido antigen is a low molecular weight protein (Cunningham-Rundles et al., 1977). Tilley et al. (1978) have partially characterized these antigens on cell membranes and have presumably identified them as C4d. The heterogeneity suggested b y our experiments in p o o l e d sera is compatible with the genetic data on these blood groups. To our knowledge little or no fluid phase characterization has been carried out, nor have other than human antisera against C4 been tested. We therefore propose this procedure as a convenient m e t h o d for the preparation of material for such work.
