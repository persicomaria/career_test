Vesicle budding: a coat for the COPs

Although vesicular transport in eukaryotic cells involves a number of different carriers, one common feature is that most of them use small GTPases to direct coat assembly at the donor membrane. COPII coated vesicles bud from the endoplasmic reticulum to selectively export secretory cargo en route to the Golgi complex. Vesicle formation involves the stepwise recruitment of the small GTPase Sar1 and two large heterodimeric complexes Sec23­Sec24 and Sec13­Sec31 to the membrane. A new structural study now provides breathtaking molecular insights into the formation of the Sec23­Sec24­Sar1 pre-budding complex and into COPII coat assembly. Protein and membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells is mediated at least in part by the budding and fusion of intracellular transport vesicles that selectively carry cargo proteins and lipids from donor to acceptor organelles. COP- and clathrin-coated vesicles represent the two main classes of vesicular carriers within the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways [1,2]. COPII-coated vesicles shuttle diverse passenger molecules from exit sites of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) towards the early Golgi complex [3,4]. Formation of COPII vesicles requires the ordered assembly of the coat built from the cytosolic components Sar1, Sec23­ Sec24 and Sec13­ Sec31. This process is initiated by GDP-to-GTP exchange on the small ras-like GTPase Sar1 at the ER membrane, which then recruits a heterodimeric complex of Sec23 and Sec24 to generate a pre-budding complex. Recruitment of Sec13­Sec31 heterodimer finally leads to membrane deformation and budding of COPII-coated vesicles. A series of elegant experiments by Schekman and colleagues has demonstrated that all you need to build a COPII vesicle are the three components of the coat and a negatively charged membrane surface containing acidic phospholipids [5]. Although it is expected that a number of regulatory interactions contributed by cargo proteins such as SNAREs [6] or modulators of coat assembly like Sec16 [7,8] might spatially restrict vesicle budding, Sar1­GTP, Sec23­Sec24 and Sec13­Sec31 clearly are at the heart of the budding process. Recent crystallographic work by Goldberg and colleagues [9] has now provided us with a molecular framework for the initial steps of COPII-coated vesicle assembly. The molecular structure of the Sec23­Sec24 ­Sar1 pre-budding complex Goldberg and coworkers [9] have assembled an atomic model of the Sec23­ Sec24 ­Sar1 pre-budding complex from the individually determined structures of Sec23­ Sec24 and

Sec23­ Sar1 bound to the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GppNHp. The overall structure of the complex reveals a bow-tie-shaped 15 nm-long assembly (Fig. 1a). The two halves of the bow-tie correspond to similarly folded Sec23 and Sec24 molecules that interact about a dyad. The elongated Sec23­ Sec24 ­Sar1 complex largely extends parallel to the membrane bilayer, with a positively charged concave inner surface that could nicely accommodate the hydrophilic face of a curved vesicular bud (Fig. 1b). This chemical feature also explains the need for acidic phospholipids in budding COPII vesicles from synthetic liposomes [3,4,8]. Despite their limited primary sequence conservation, the Sec23 and Sec24 polypeptides exhibit closely related folds comprising five distinct domains: a b-barrel, a zinc finger, an a/b vWA trunk domain forming the dimer interface, an a-helical region, and a carboxy-terminal gelsolin module. Of these, only the

off switch that is provided by an arginine finger within Sec23 [3,4,9]. Its guanidinium side chain contacts phosphate groups, thereby facilitating GTP hydrolysis on Sar1 and hence coat disassembly. In vivo, this activity of Sec23­Sec24 might require the activating effect of Sec13­Sec31, which stimulates GAP activity by an order of magnitude [13]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that Sar1-mediated GTP hydrolysis will only occur after the assembly of Sec23­Sec24 with Sec13­Sec31 has been completed. Concluding remarks The structural analysis of the Sec23­Sec24­Sar1 prebudding complex for the first time allows a glimpse into COPII-coated vesicle assembly. Regulatory molecules such as Sec16 and membrane cargo presumably also interact with or affect the formation of the pre-budding complex. Hence, it will be interesting to see how these factors become integrated into the COPII assembly pathway at the structural level. The crystallographic data also provide a molecular explanation of how small GTPases like Sar1 might directly initiate coat recruitment. Although similar roles have been proposed for Arf1 in directing clathrin coat assembly at the TGN, it is unclear whether the process of clathrin-coated pit assembly at the Golgi follows related principles. One of the most fascinating aspects of the provisional structural analysis of COPII and clathrin coat components is the diversity of molecular building modules involved in coat assembly. We therefore eagerly await the next steps in the structural analysis of these complex molecular machines to see how the cooperative assembly of its different units leads to membrane deformation and finally vesicle budding.

gelsolin domain does not contribute to the inner surface of the complex and would thus be ideally suited to interact with the outer Sec13­ Sec31 shell of COPII. COPII ­ a coat unlike some others The elongated shape of the pre-budding complex is in agreement with electron microscopic studies revealing a rather densely packed surface of COPII-coated vesicles [10], in marked contrast to the open honeycomb-like clathrin baskets of plasma-membrane-derived endocytic vesicles [11]. Surprisingly also, the overall architecture and folding of the coat components Sec23­Sec24 bears no resemblance to the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 [12], a coat protein required for the assembly and invagination of clathrin-coated vesicles. The AP2 core, in contrast to Sec23­Sec24­Sar is a highly compact, almost rectangular, complex that presumably does not cover extensive areas of membrane [12]. These structural differences between AP2 and COPII coats suggest that membrane deformation into vesicular buds might be accomplished by distinct assembly schemes and mechanisms within different intracellular compartments. Sar1 ­ a primer of COPII assembly Finally, the new crystallographic work [9] tells us how activated Sar1­GTP might initiate coat complex assembly. Binding of GTP appears to induce a conformational change within Sar1 that allows an amino-terminal extension and amphipathic a-helix to engage in interactions with membrane phospholipids and for several loop regions to associate with Sec23 (Fig. 2). Indeed, the Sar1 binding site is the most conserved region of extended surface on Sec23/24. Interestingly enough, the pre-budding complex reveals a built-in
