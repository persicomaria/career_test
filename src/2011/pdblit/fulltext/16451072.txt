A new series of nonpeptidic cathepsin K inhibitors that are based on a -substituted cyclohexanecarboxamide motif has been developed. Lead optimization yielded compounds with sub-nanomolar potency and exceptional selectivity profiles against cathepsins B, L, and S. Use of fluorine atoms to block metabolism on the cyclohexyl ring led to compounds with excellent pharmacokinetic properties. Considering the well-established role of cathepsin K in osteoclast-mediated bone turnover, compounds such as (-)-34a (hrab Cat K IC50 0.28 nM; >800-fold selectivity vs Cat B, L, and S; PK data in dogs: F 55%, t1/2 ) 15 h) exhibit great potential for development as an orally bioavailable therapeutic for treatment of diseases that involve bone loss.
Introduction Cathepsin K is a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays a fundamental role in the osteoclast-mediated degradation of the collagen framework of bone.1 Consequently, it has become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in diseases involving pathophysiological bone resorption.2 Our efforts in this area have been focused on the identification of a once-daily, orally bioavailable cathepsin K inhibitor for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. We have recently shown that replacement of the P2-P3 amide bond in dipeptide-nitrile inhibitor 13a,b with an aryl ring in 2 (Figure 1) was an effective strategy for the development of potent and selective cathepsin K inhibitors that exhibit superior pharmacokinetic profiles as compared to their peptidic counterparts.4a We now wish to report that further research in this area has identified a -substituted cyclohexanecarboxamide scaffold as a promising new entity for the construction of cathepsin K inhibitors. Discovery and Initial SAR Studies The cyclohexanecarboxamide series of cathepsin K inhibitors were borne out of an attempt to replace the P2-P3 amide bond in 33b with a methylene-thioether moiety in 4 (Figure 2). As shown in Scheme 1, treatment of a mixture of bromoester 5a and benzyl mercaptan with K2CO3 in methanol did not generate 6 as hoped, but rather produced 7 (syn:anti 13:1) via a 1,4-addition of the thiolate anion onto the in situ generated R, -unsaturated ester 5b. Saponification of the ester functionality in 7 with NaOH followed by HATU-mediated coupling of the resulting acid with aminoacetonitrile afforded syn-isomer 8a, the corresponding anti-isomer 8b, and elimination product 8c in a ratio of 26:1:14. Anti-isomer 8b was found to have a potency similar to that of 3 against human cathepsin K (hCat K IC50 ) 52 and 78 nM, respectively) despite the loss of a hydrogen-bonding interaction of the P2-P3 amide N-H with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly66

in the active site of the enzyme.5a The syn-isomer 8a was 5-fold less potent (hCat K IC50 ) 280 nM) than 8b. Excision of the P3 benzyl thioether and introduction of a conjugated double bond in 8c resulted in a dramatic loss of activity against cathepsin K (hCat K IC50 ) 3400 nM). The difficulties associated with the preparation of the more potent isomer 8b, because of the tendency of 7 to expel benzyl mercaptan under strongly basic conditions, prompted us to transpose the carbon and sulfur atoms in the P2-P3 linker. This was accomplished as illustrated in Scheme 2. Starting from trans-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid anhydride (9), the warhead portion of the inhibitor was introduced by reaction with aminoacetonitrile in the presence of DMAP to yield 10. Reduction of the carboxylic acid moiety in 10, via treatment of an in situ generated mixed anhydride with sodium borohydride, was followed by reaction of the resulting alcohol with tosyl chloride to yield 11. Nucleophilic displacement of the tosylate with thiophenolate anion produced 12a (ArdPh). Fortunately, only a modest loss in potency was associated with reorganization of the methylenethioether linker (hCat K IC50 ) 140 nM for 12a vs 52 nM for 8b). From intermediate 11, we prepared a wide variety of thioether analogues and studied the effect of varying P3 on human and humanized-rabbit (hrab) cathepsin K6 inhibition and selectivity

in our counterscreen against cathepsins B, L, and S. We found that placing a para-substituted phenyl moiety in P3 yielded the most potent inhibitors of cathepsin K (Table 1). Additional tuning of the P3 SAR identified a methylthioether as the optimal group in the para-position (12f, Table 1). This feature further distinguishes this series of compounds from their dipeptide counterparts, which require a basic amine moiety in P3 to attain similar levels of potency and selectivity.5a,b Introduction of metaor di- and trisubstituted aromatics (Table 2), as well as monoand bicyclic-heteroaromatic rings (Table 3), in P3 generally produced less potent inhibitors. We next turned our attention to studying the effect of further modification of the P2-P3 linker on cathepsin enzyme activity. Oxidation of the thioether in 12b to the corresponding sulfone with Oxone followed by a SNAr displacement of the fluorine atom by reaction with 10 equiv of NaSCH3 in DMF afforded 13b in 93% yield for the two steps (Scheme 3). It should be noted that the electrophilic nitrile functionality was stable to these reaction conditions.

Hydrocarbon-based P2-P3 linkers were introduced as shown in Scheme 4. Reaction of known aldehyde 147 with Wittig reagent 15 afforded alkene 16 (Z/E 5.7:1). Subsequent ester saponification, double bond hydrogenation, and coupling of the resulting acid 17 with aminoacetonitrile afforded the fully saturated hydrocarbon linker in 18. Omission of the double bond reduction step from this sequence produced the corresponding alkene analogue 19. Replacement of the styrene moiety in 19 with a chemically and more metabolically robust biphenyl in 24a was accomplished as shown in Scheme 5. Diels-Alder addition of orthobromocinnamic acid 20 to 1,4-butadiene under forcing conditions in a steel bomb gave 21 in 82% yield. Exposure of 21 to an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of palladium on charcoal preferentially reduced the double bond in the presence

of the hindered ortho-substituted aryl bromide. Subsequent coupling of the carboxylic acid functionality to aminoacetonitrile yielded intermediate 23 from which a variety of biaryl analogues were prepared, including 24a and 24b, via a Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling reaction. A summary of the effect of varying the P2-P3 linker on cathepsin K potency and anti-target selectivities can be found in Table 4. Compound 13b, possessing a methylene-sulfone P2P3 linker, was equipotent to the methylene-thioether linked analogue (12f) against cathepsin K, but proved to be slightly less selective in the counterscreen assays. Replacing the sulfur atom in 12f with a methylene unit in 18 yielded a 2-fold increase in potency; however, cathepsin L selectivity was eroded as a result of this change. Introduction of a unit of unsaturation in 19 produced a sub-nanomolar inhibitor of cathepsin K and restored cathepsin L selectivity to the level observed with 12f. Phenyl-linked analogue 24a retained the impressive selectivity profile exhibited by 12f and 19 while maintaining low nanomolar potency against cathepsin K. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism I The pharmacokinetic profiles of 13b and 24a were evaluated by intravenous dosing in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Both of these compounds were rapidly cleared from circulation (t1/2 ) 5 min, Cl ) 38 mL/min/kg for 13b; t1/2 ) 44 min, Cl ) 35

mL/min/kg for 24a). Incubation of 13b and 24a with rat or human hepatocytes produced two major metabolites in each case. These were identified as the corresponding P3 sulfoxides and sulfones (25a-d, Figure 3) through LC-MS analysis of the incubation media, and comparison with authentic standards prepared by the chemical oxidation of 13b and 24a with m-CPBA. Poor pharmacokinetics was also exhibited by analogues 13c (t1/2 ) 20 min, Cl ) 42 mL/min/kg) and 24b (t1/2 ) 45 min, Cl ) 50 mL/min/kg) despite the absence of a group susceptible to metabolic oxidation in P3 (Figure 3). This prompted us to consider that other portions of these inhibitors were susceptible to cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism. LCMS analysis of the rat hepatocyte incubations of 13c and 24b revealed that several M+16 metabolites were indeed produced. MS-fragmentation analysis for each metabolite identified the cyclohexyl portion as the main site of oxidation. The radiolabeled compound 13d, prepared by palladium-catalyzed tritiation of aryl bromide 28 (Scheme 6), was also incubated with rat hepatocytes. The additional sensitivity offered by radio-HPLC analysis enabled us to determine that the metabolic oxidation of 13b was even more extensive than that revealed by LCMS analysis alone (Figure 4). Obtaining acceptable pharmacokinetic profiles for this class of compounds would obviously require a dramatic improvement in metabolic stability. Thus, a study of the P2SAR aimed at achieving this was initiated. X-ray Structure and Molecular Modeling An X-ray crystal structure of P3-methoxy analogue 13e bound to the active site of cathepsin K revealed that this series of inhibitors adopt a binding orientation similar to their peptidic counterparts.5a The salient features of this enzyme-inhibitor complex are illustrated in Figure 5a. These include the thio-

imidate moiety formed by covalent union of the nitrile carbon and the sulfur of Cys25, the hydrogen bond between the thioimidate N-H and terminal oxygen of Gln19, hydrogenbonding contacts between the P1-P2 amide of the inhibitor with the N-H of Gly66 and the carbonyl oxygen of Asn158. Note also the deep penetration of the cyclohexyl ring into S2, and the manner in which the aromatic plate of the inhibitor neatly fits into the region of S3 bordered by the aromatic ring of Tyr67 and the shelf-like structure formed by Gly65 and Gly66. Starting from the X-ray structure of 13e bound to cathepsin K, molecular dynamics calculations were carried out in AMBER8 to identify the positions and nature of substituents that would maintain or improve binding to the S2 pocket. Particular attention was paid to electron-withdrawing substituents such as fluorine or chlorine atoms, as a means of reducing oxidative metabolism of the cyclohexyl ring. Figure 5b shows the modeled structure of 13f with two fluorine atoms added to the cyclohexyl ring of 13e, which the calculations indicated would be well tolerated by the protein. Synthesis of Halogenated P2 Analogues The synthetic route that was used to prepare the gemdihalogenated-cyclohexyl analogues of 24a and 24b is shown in Scheme 7. Diels-Alder adduct 21 from Scheme 5 was converted to bromolactone 29 using Iwata's conditions.9a Treatment of 29 with sodium methoxide in methanol opened the lactone to afford bromohydroxyester 30. Oxidation of the alcohol functionality in 30 with Jones reagent followed by reductive debromination of the resulting R-bromoketone with

activated zinc dust gave 31 in 31% overall yield from 21. Conversion of the ketone functionality in 31 to a gem-difluoro moiety in 32a was effected with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).9b Under a variety of reaction conditions, 32a was invariably contaminated with two isomeric halogenated alkenes (32b,c) that were not separable from the desired product by flash chromatography. Fortunately, treatment of the crude product mixture with excess ozone at -78 °C followed by oxidative workup with 30% H2O2 was successful in converting the fluoroalkene byproducts to the corresponding diacids, which were easily removed by washing with an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate. Compound 32a was converted to 33 by a two-step sequence involving ester saponification with LiOH followed by coupling of the resulting acid with aminoacetonitrile. Conversion of aryl bromide 33 to a variety of biaryls10 including 34a and 34b was accomplished in good yield using a Suzuki-Miyaura reaction under standard conditions with PdCl2(dppf) as catalyst. Both enantiomers of 34a were also accessed using the chemistry shown in Scheme 7 following resolution of 21 with (S)- and (R)-R-methylbenzylamine to afford (+)- and (-)-21, respectively, in 93% ee. The more potent enantiomer of 34a, prepared from (-)-21, was determined to be the (-)-antipode. The absolute configurations of (+)-34a and (-)-34a were established as (1S,2S)- and (1R,2R)-, respectively, by conversion of (+)-21 to the known compound (+)-35 (Scheme 8).11,12 Results and Discussion Installation of a gem-difluoro in rac-34a yielded a 5-fold increase in potency against Cat K (Table 5) as compared to the nonhalogenated inhibitor 24a. The more potent enantiomer (-)34a retained an acceptable selectivity profile against cathepsins L, B, and S and exhibited good potency (IC50 ) 16 nM, n ) 3) in our functional bone resorption assay that evaluates the degradation of the type I collagen matrix of bovine bone by isolated rabbit osteoclasts.4b Introduction of a gem-chloro in rac34c13 resulted in a 5-fold potency boost against cathepsin K; however, cathepsin S selectivity was diminished as a consequence of this modification. The presence of a single axial or equatorial fluorine on the cyclohexyl ring in rac-38a and rac38b, respectively14 (Scheme 9), had little effect on Cat K IC50. Thus, it appears that both fluorine substituents act cooperatively in 34a to produce a synergistic enhancement of inhibitor binding to S2 of the Cat K active site.

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism II. Introduction of the gem-difluoro group onto the cyclohexyl ring also achieved the desired improvement in pharmacokinetics (Table 6). Acceptable terminal half-lives (t1/2) and oral bioavailabilities (%F) were observed for (-)-34a in the three animal species shown with a particularly impressive PK profile being observed in dog (F )

55%, t1/2 ) 15 h). gem-Difluorination of the cyclohexyl ring likewise resulted in an increase in t1/2 in rats from 45 min for 24b to 4.5 h for rac-34b. A comparable enhancement of halflife in rats was also achieved with chlorine substituents in rac34c (t1/2 = 3.1 h). Introduction of a single fluorine at the 5-position in rac-38a improved the half-lives of this class of Cat K inhibitors from a few minutes to over an hour in rats. However, the terminal half-life observed in squirrel monkeys for rac-38a (t1/2 ) 0.8 h) was far shorter than that seen for (-)-34a (t1/2 ) 8.8 h). In contrast with the metabolic profile presented in Figure 4, incubation of rac-34b with rat hepatocytes led to the production of only one major M+16 metabolite. It was not possible to ascertain by MS-fragmentation analysis if oxygenation was occurring on the cyclohexyl or aromatic portion of the inhibitor.

Similar incubation of (-)-34a with rat and human hepatocytes revealed that oxidative metabolism was predominantly confined to the P3-thioether. This produced both the corresponding sulfoxide (39a) and the sulfone (39b) metabolites, which were determined to be 100-fold less potent than the parent compound. The structures of 39a and 39b were confirmed by LCMS analysis through comparison with synthetic standards. Kinetic Characterization of (-)-34a. The reversibility of inhibition of humanized-rabbit cathepsin K by (-)-34a was demonstrated in experiments in which a 1:1 enzyme-inhibitor

mixture (125 nM) was preincubated for 15 min, followed by a 500-fold dilution into substrate-containing buffer (0.2 µM citrate). After dilution, the cathepsin K enzyme activity was initially >95% inhibited, and slowly recovered with a first-order rate constant of 0.0081 s-1 (t1/2 ) 86 s). The final steady-state enzyme activity was 80% that of control, demonstrating the reversibility of the formation of the (-)-34a-cathepsin K complex. Conclusion A new class of nonpeptidic cathepsin K inhibitors that employ a nitrile-warhead on a -substituted cyclohexanecarboxamide scaffold has been developed. SAR optimization of our initial lead (8b) culminated in the identification of (-)-34a, a compound that exhibited sub-nanomolar inhibition of cathepsin K, excellent selectivity against the closely related cathepsins

B, L, and S, and an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile in a number of animal species. Thus, the -substituted cyclohexanecarboxamide moiety has been validated as a promising new scaffold for the development of orally bioavailable cathepsin K inhibitors as bone anti-resorptive agents. Experimental Section
General. Zinc dust was activated by successive washing in a sintered glass filter funnel with dilute HCl solution, water, ethanol, and ether followed by drying under a stream of nitrogen and finally under high vacuum. m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) was purified by washing a benzene solution of commercial material with two portions of pH 7.4 phosphate buffer followed by recrystallization from ether/hexanes. All other reagents were obtained commercially and used without further purification. Proton (1H NMR) magnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz instrument. All spectra were recorded in d6-acetone (unless otherwise indicated) using residual solvent as internal standard. Signal multiplicity was designated according to the following abbreviations: s ) singlet, d ) doublet, dd ) doublet of doublets, ddd ) doublet of doublet of doublets, t ) triplet, q ) quartet, dt ) doublet of triplets, td ) triplet of doublets, dq ) doublet of quartets, m ) multiplet, br ) broad. Elemental analyses were provided by Prevalere Life Sciences Inc., Whitesboro, NY. Rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer model 241 polarimeter. Reactions were carried out with continuous stirring under a positive pressure of nitrogen except where noted. Flash chromatography was carried out with silica gel 60, 230-400 mesh. Enzyme Expression and Purification. See ref 4a. Enzyme Activity Assays. See ref 15. Pharmacokinetic and Bioavailability Experiments. Single compounds were dosed orally as suspensions in 1% methocel and intravenously via the jugular vein as solutions in PEG-200/H2O (3:2). Dosing volumes used for oral administration were 10 mL/kg for rats and rabbits, 1 mL/kg for monkeys, and 5 mL/kg for dogs. Intravenous dosing volumes of 1 mL/kg were used for all species. Animals receiving the oral suspensions were fasted overnight prior to a.m. dosing. Plasma samples were collected at regular intervals and analyzed by LC-MS following a protein precipitation with 1.5 volumes of acetonitrile and centrifugation. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Hepatocyte Incubations. For hepatocyte incubations, 1 × 106 cells diluted in 0.5 mL of Krebs-Henseleit buffer were first prepared at 37 °C for 20 min under 95%:5% O2:CO2 (BOC gases; Montreal, Canada) in a 48-well plate, and then 5 µL of 10 mM solution of compound dissolved in acetonitrile was added to each well to a final concentration of 50 µM. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C under 95%:5% O2:CO2 atmosphere, one volume of acetonitrile was added in each well. A quenched incubation spiked with the parent compound and a blank were also prepared as controls. Once transferred, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14 000 rpm using an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge (Hamburg, Germany), and the supernatant was used for LC/UV/MS analysis. X-ray Structure Determination of 13e Bound to Cathepsin K. A mutant of rabbit cathepsin K was expressed and purified as described previously.16 Compound 13e was cocrystallized with the mutant cathepsin K at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir consisted of 0.18 M magnesium formate, and the drop was formed by 2 µL of a solution of 10 mg/mL cathepsin K in 25 mM sodium acetate (pH 3.9) and by 2 µL of the reservoir solution. Crystals formed within 4 days, and diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV area detector, using X-rays produced by a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator. The data were reduced using the HKL package, and refinement was carried out by iterating between manual rebuilding using Quanta (MSI, Inc.) and automated refinement using CNX (MSI, Inc.). Data and refinement statistics for the final model are shown in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. The coordinates

A mixture of 5a (520 mg, 2.35 mmol) and milled K2CO3 (990 mg, 7.20 mmol) was suspended in MeOH (10 mL). Benzyl mercaptan (0.50 mL, 4.2 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 6 days at room temperature before partitioning between ethyl acetate and 1 M NaOH. The organic phase was washed with 1 M NaOH and brine, then dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. Purification by flash chromatography (5/95 to 12/88 ethyl acetate/hexanes) provided the title compound (syn:anti 13:1) as a faint-yellow oil 157 mg (25%). 1H NMR: major isomer (syn)  7.35 (4H, m), 7.25 (1H, m), 3.77 (1H, d, J ) 13 Hz), 3.73 (1H, d, J ) 13 Hz), 3.60 (3H, s), 3.28 (1H, m), 2.73 (1H, td, J ) 3.8, 11 Hz), 1.88 (1H, m), 1.70 (5H, m), 1.45 (1H, m), 1.30 (1H, m); discernible signals for the minor isomer (anti)  3.65 (3H, s), 2.41 (1H, dt, J ) 3.8, 11 Hz). Alternatively, the title compound can be prepared by refluxing a mixture of 5b (1.00 g, 7.14 mmol), benzyl mercaptan (1.07 g, 8.63 mmol), and K2CO3 (1.52 g, 11.0 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) for 24 h. Substitution of water for 1 M NaOH in the workup procedure above and flash chromatography on silica eluting with 12/88 EtOAc/ hexanes provides 7 as a colorless oil (1.62 g, 86%, syn:anti 13:1). (1R/S,2R/S)-2-(Benzylthio)-N-(cyanomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (8a), (1R/S,2S/R)-2-(Benzylthio)-N-(cyanomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (8b), and N-(Cyanomethyl)cyclohex1-ene-1-carboxamide (8c). A solution of 7 (650 mg, 2.50 mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of MeOH and THF (4 mL) was treated with 2 M NaOH (4 mL, 8 mmol) followed by heating to reflux for 1 h (strong smell of benzyl mercaptan). The mixture was cooled, diluted with water, and extracted with ether. The aqueous layer was acidified with 1 M HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated to give 370 mg of a colorless oil that was combined with HATU (1.20 g, 3.20 mmol), aminoacetonitrile hydrochloride (0.70 g, 7.6 mmol), and Hunig's base (2.0 mL, 12 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) with stirring at room temperature overnight. The mixture was then added to 1 M HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×).
