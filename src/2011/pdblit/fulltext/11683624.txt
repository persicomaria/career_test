ABSTRACT: BRCT (BRCA1 carboxyl terminus) domains are found in a number of DNA repair enzymes and cell cycle regulators and are believed to mediate important protein-protein interactions. The DNA ligase IIIR BRCT domain partners with the distal BRCT domain of the DNA repair protein XRCC1 (X1BRCTb) in the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. To elucidate the mechanisms by which these two domains can interact, we have determined the solution structure of human ligase IIIR BRCT (L3[86], residues 837-922). The structure of L3[86] consists of a 2 1 3 4 parallel sheet with a twoR-helix bundle packed against one face of the sheet. This fold is conserved in several proteins having a wide range of activities, including X1BRCTb [Zhang, X. D., et al. (1998) EMBO J. 17, 6404-6411]. L3[86] exists as a dimer in solution, but an insufficient number of NOE restraints precluded the determination of the homodimer structure. However, 13C isotope-filtered and hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments indicate that the N-terminus, R1, the R1- 2 loop, and the three residues following R2 are involved in forming the dimer interface, as similarly observed in the structure of X1BRCTb. NOE and dynamic data indicate that several residues (837-844) in the N-terminal region appear to interconvert between helix and random coil conformations. Further studies of other BRCT domains and of their complexes are needed to address how these proteins interact with one another, and to shed light on how mutations can lead to disruption of function and ultimately disease.

BRCT1 (BRCA1 C-terminus) domains are autonomously folding units of approximately 95 residues (1, 2). The name is derived from their homology with the C-terminal region of the breast cancer suppresser protein, BRCA1. Deletions and mutations within the BRCT region of BRCA1 have been identified as a high-risk factor for breast and ovarian cancers (3). On the basis of the experimental evidence to date, it is believed that BRCT domains recruit and bind other BRCT domains or unknown protein folds with high affinity and specificity. Thus, mutations within these domains might deleteriously affect DNA repair and other cellular pathways

that rely on protein-protein interactions for normal function. Another hypothesis suggests that the BRCT domains may be molecular sensors allowing indirect or direct recognition of particular DNA structures (4). Sequence analysis using hydrophobic clustering has identified the presence of 50 copies of BRCT domains in 23 different proteins involved in DNA repair, recombination, and cell cycle control (5). However, the three-dimensional structure of only one, the 3.2 Å X-ray crystallographic structure of the distal BRCT domain of the repair protein XRCC1 (X1BRCTb), has been determined (6). This structure is of an asymmetric homodimer in which each monomeric unit is comprised of a four-stranded parallel -sheet surrounded by three R-helices (6). Although the XRCC1 protein has no known enzymatic function, it has been suggested that it coordinates the rapid recruitment of polymerase , poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), and ligase IIIR (L3R) to the DNA substrate during DNA base excision repair (BER) (2, 7-10). While pol interacts with the N-terminal domain of XRCC1 (11), PARP and L3R interact with XRCC1 via their respective BRCT domains (2, 8). In addition, the coordinated expression of XRCC1 and L3R is required to maintain normal L3R activity levels in the cell (12, 13). The L3 protein is distinguished from other DNA ligases by its ability to join an oligo(rA) hybridized to a poly(dT) template (14) and by a unique N-terminal (residues 18-55) zinc finger motif that is homologous to a PARP DNA nick sensing zinc finger domain (8). Compared to other mammalian ligases, the L3 protein is also more closely related to viral ligases (15), which appear to play analogous roles

Structure and Dynamics of the Ligase IIIR BRCT Domain in the repair and recombination of the viral genome (16, 17). There are two isoforms of L3, R and , that have identical catalytic properties, but differ as a result of a tissue-specific alternative splicing mechanism entailing exons encoding the carboxyl terminus (15, 18-20). The 96 kDa L3 is found in testes during the latter stages of meiotic prophase, whereas the 103 kDa L3R form is present at similar levels in several tissues (21). L3 does not contain the BRCT domain and is stable without XRCC1; L3R requires XRCC1 for stability (22). Recently, we have shown that a significant increase in thermostability is imparted by the interaction between the BRCT domains of L3R and XRCC1, which may explain why cells require XRCC1 to maintain L3R activity (23). Here we report on the NMR structure and backbone dynamics of the human L3R BRCT domain (L3[86], residues 837-922) in an effort to gain further insight into the functional roles of XRCC1/L3 BRCT domains in proteinprotein interactions. Our results show that the L3[86] protein adopts a core structure consisting of a 2 1 3 4 parallel sheet with a two-R-helix bundle packed against one face of the sheet. This core fold is found in several proteins having low levels of sequence homology and a broad range of functional activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation. The expression and purification of L3[86] have been described in detail by Thornton et al. (23). Briefly, uniformly 15N-labeled and 15N- and 13C-labeled L3[86] proteins (residues 837-922) were overexpressed in a BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli host as a glutathione Stransferase (GST) fusion protein in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 g/L 15NH4Cl and 5 g/L unlabeled or 13C-labeled glucose, purified on a glutathione-agarose affinity column, digested with bovine thrombin, and further purified using size-exclusion chromatography. A 10% nonrandom fractionally 13C-labeled sample was also overexpressed using minimal medium that contained 3.6 g/L unlabeled glucose and 0.4 g/L 98% 13C-labeled glucose (24). After thrombin cleavage, the L3[86] protein has two additional non-native residues (Gly and Ser) at the N-terminus, as confirmed by mass spectrometry (SynPep, Dublin, CA). The calculated pI of L3[86] is 7.94; the calculated molecular mass is 9973 Da, and the extinction coefficient is 13 940 M-1 cm-1 at 280 nm (assuming all Cys residues are reduced) (25). Typical yields of labeled L3[86] were 7 mg/L of cell culture. The protein was >95% pure as determined by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All NMR experiments were performed on samples dissolved in 50 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, and 25 mM d10-DTT (Isotech) (pH 6.6). Final protein concentrations were 0.4-1.0 mM. NMR Experiments. NMR experiments were carried out on a 600 MHz Varian INOVA spectrometer at 15 °C using either home-written pulse sequences or those available in the Protein Pack software package provided by Varian (Palo Alto, CA). Proton chemical shifts were referenced to the H2O signal, while the 15N and 13C signals were referenced indirectly using  ratios of 0.251 449 530 and 0.101 329 188, respectively. The temperature was calibrated using an external methanol sample. Spectra were processed and analyzed using Felix 97 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). A 15Nlabeled sample in a 9:1 H2O/D2O mixture was used to acquire
15N-HSQC

Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 44, 2001 13159 (28 ms mixing time) (27), (50 ms mixing time) (28), HNHA (29), and SCT-HMSQC-HA (30) spectra. Hydrogendeuterium (H-D) exchange kinetics were measured via a series of 15N-HSQC experiments (32 scans, 40 t1 increments, and a total acquisition time of 55 min). Buffer exchange to 100% D2O was carried out using an Amicon 8MC MicroUltrafiltration System (YM10 membrane). Acquisition of the first experiment was initiated 150 min after the buffer exchange. A 13C- and 15N-labeled L3[86] sample in 95% H2O was used to acquire the HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, and HCCH-COSY spectra (31). The same sample in 100% D2O was used to acquire the HCCHTOCSY (22.5 ms mixing time), 13C-TOCSY-HSQC (30 ms mixing time), 13C-NOESY-HSQC (centered at the aliphatic region of 42.4 ppm, 50 ms mixing time), and 13C-NOESYHSQC (centered at the aromatic region of 121.7 ppm, 75 ms mixing time) spectra. In addition, a 1H/13C-HSQC spectrum was acquired on a sample containing 15% 13C isotopic enrichment to enable stereospecific assignments for the methyl groups of leucine and valine (24), which were confirmed by analysis of a ct-HSQC spectrum (constant time delay of 0.0295 s) (32). An unlabeled sample was used to acquire homonuclear DQF-COSY (33), z-TOCSY (28 ms mixing time) (27), and NOESY spectra (50 ms mixing time) (34, 35). 15N Backbone Relaxation Measurements. The 15N longitudinal and transverse relaxation rate constants, R1 and R2, respectively, were determined by collecting a time series of 15N-HSQC spectra with an appropriate Rance-Kay type of sensitivity enhancement (26). R1 and R2 data sets were obtained using the relaxation delays of 0.01, 0.05, 0.11, 0.21, 0.43, 0.81, and 1.5 s for R2 experiments and 0.01, 0.05, 0.11, 0.17, 0.23, and 0.35 s for R1 experiments with duplicate measurements at all the time points. 15N hard pulses were applied at a field strength of 10.2 kHz, while the decoupling was achieved by the multipulse sequence GARP1 (36) at 1.5 kHz. {1H}-15N steady-state NOE data sets were obtained by acquiring spectra with and without 1H saturation prior to the beginning of the experiment. 1H saturation was achieved by a series of 120° pulses (at a field strength of 7.5 kHz) applied 5 ms apart for a total of 3 s (37). Signals were averaged over 64 transients, with the delay between the transients for the R1 (R2) and NOE experiments being 3 and 2 s, respectively. Acquisition times along the t2 (1H) and t1 (15N) dimensions were 71.1 and 18.03 ms, respectively, while the spectral widths in the corresponding dimensions were 7200.7 and 1775.0 Hz, respectively. In all the experiments described above, the carrier for the proton frequency was kept on the water resonance. The relaxation data were processed using NMRPipe (38). R1, R2, and heteronuclear NOE time domain data along t1 were forward linear predicted once before application of a combination of cosine bell and a weak Lorentzian-Gaussian function, and only a cosine apodization was applied along the t2 dimension. The data were zero filled once before Fourier transformation. The software package NMRView (39) was used for peak picking and calculation of peak intensities. The uncertainties in the peak heights were estimated from duplicated experiments, while R1 and R2 were calculated using FORTRAN codes developed in-house. Relaxation rate constants and related uncertainties were

Heteronuclear steady-state NOEs were determined as the ratio of the peak intensities with and without proton saturation. For a heteronuclear two-unlike spin system, the relaxation rate constants (R1 and R2) and the steady-state heteronuclear NOE for the 1H-15N spin pair can be given by the power spectral density functions of the rotational motions at five frequencies  ) 0, N, H - N, H, and H + N. In the reduced spectral density mapping approach, if it is assumed that dJ()/d2 is relatively constant between the linear combinations H + N and H - N, the rate constants and NOE can be expressed as a linear combination of only three spectral density functions, J(0), J(N), and J(0.87H). Following this procedure, the spectral density functions at these three frequencies in terms of the relaxation parameters can be written as (40, 41)

Krishnan et al. value of 1.8 Å. Pseudoatom corrections were applied whenever stereospecific assignments were not available. Hydrogen bonding constraints (1.8 Å e dHN-O e 2.3 Å and 2.5 Å e dN-O e 3.3 Å) were used only if the amide proton exhibited significant signal intensity in the H-D exchange experiment 6 h after exchange and if the RC chemical shift index and 3JHNR values indicated well-defined secondary structure.  angle restraints (-65 ( 25°, 3JHNR < 4.0 Hz, or -120 ( 30°, 3JHNR > 8.0) were assigned from the 3JHNR coupling constant measurements obtained using either the 3D-HNHA or 2D-SCT-HMSQC-HA experiments. Additional  or constraints were not used. Structure Calculations. Structures of L3[86] were calculated by simulated annealing using torsion angle dynamics in DYANA starting from 299 random conformers (42). The ratio of relative weights of upper limit, lower limit, van der Waals, and torsional constraints to target function calculations was set to 1:1:2:5. The stereospecific assignments were optimized using the HABAS algorithm in DYANA. Structures were calculated initially using only NOE-derived constraints. Then, hydrogen bond constraints were introduced, and finally, the torsional angle constraints were incorporated. The qualities of the 20 best structures (based on the final target energy function in DYANA) were analyzed with AQUA and PROCHECK-NMR (43). Structures were visualized and figures generated using MOLMOL (44). Structural Comparison with the XRCC1 BRCT Domains. The coordinates for the monomeric form of the XRCC1 BRCT domain (X1BRCTb, residues 538-629) in the crystal state (PDB entry 1CDZ) (6) was used for comparison with the average structure of L3[86] in solution by using the Kabsch and Sander algorithm and visualized using the program MOLMOL (44). Interhelical angles were measured using the method of Chothia incorporated in MOLMOL (44). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Resonance Assignments. Sequence-specific assignments of nearly complete (>95% backbone and 90% side chain) 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances were obtained (available at the BioMagResBank database). In a few cases, aliphatic protons of residues with long side chains, such as Arg and Lys, could not be assigned unambiguously due to signal overlap in the 1H dimension. In addition, some of the resonances belonging to the N-terminal residues (837-854) could not be assigned because the structure for this region is not well-defined. There are six prolines in the L3[86] sequence (P859, P860, P863, P899, P906, and P921). All proline peptide bonds are in the trans conformation as evidenced by strong dRid(i+1) NOEs (45). Oligomeric State of L3[86]. Size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and NMR self-diffusion coefficient measurements, which were carried out under identical conditions as used in the structural study, indicate that L3[86] behaves as a homodimer in solution (23). In addition, mass spectrometry analysis showed that the experimentally determined mass is that as expected for a tightly associated dimer (23).

For amide protons with limited intramolecular motions (determined by the ratio of R1 to R2), a local overall rotational correlation time, m, is obtained from the spectral density functions:

Equation 5 provides a good approximation of the square of the order parameter (S), in cases such as this where a model free approach to relaxation data analysis is not suitable. Distance and Dihedral Angle Constraints. Interproton distance constraints were determined from cross-peak volume measurement obtained from the 15N-NOESY-HSQC, 13CNOESY-HSQC, and homonuclear NOESY experiments (in D2O, 50 ms mixing times) using the program FELIX (Accelrys). Standard calibration was performed using backbone, side chain, and methyl classes of protons. A set of upper bounds of 2.9, 3.5, and 5.0 Å or 2.7, 3.3, and 5.0 Å corresponding to strong, medium, and weak cross-peaks, respectively, were assigned for the 15N-NOESY-HSQC and the 13C-edited NOESY and 1H-NOESY experiments, respectively. Lower bounds were set to the van der Waals radius

The deduced secondary structural elements are displayed over the sequence. The three-bond J couplings between the amide and HR protons (3JNHR) in the secondary structure regions are designated by the triangles.

explicitly identified residues V873 and A874 (located in R1) as being involved in dimer interactions. However, it was not possible to obtain additional unambiguous NOE restraints involving other residues that would aid in defining the dimer interface further. The reason for this result is most likely the low concentration (0.2 mM) of the 13C-labeled protein, which was not expressed in yields as high as that of the 15N or unlabeled protein. Furthermore, the concentration of the unlabeled-13C-labeled complex would only comprise 50% of the sample, thereby reducing the concentration by half. Thus, only very strong intermolecular cross-peaks, such as those involving the V873 and A874 residues, could be observed. Consequently, only the structure of the monomer was determined. Nonetheless, the slow amide exchange rates of several residues indicate that they are protected from solvent, though they are not involved in secondary structural hydrogen bonding interactions [Figure 1(O)] and are located on the surface of the protein. One possible explanation for this behavior is that these residues are involved in intermolecular self-association interactions. In particular, the residues following A874 (F875, D876, and G877, which comprise the short loop between R1 and 2), residues F851, T852, and V854 (located in the N-terminus), and residues K915, R917, and L918 (located in the C-terminus) have slow amide exchange rates and no defined secondary structure. The regions that encompass parts of the N-terminus, R1, the R12 loop, and the C-terminus identified by the isotope-filtered and H-D exchange experiments as the probable sites for dimerization in L3[86] happen to coincide with regions identified as the dimer interface in the crystal structure of X1BRCTb. Moreover, R867A and D878B and D849A and R870B (where A and B distinguish the two different monomeric units) can participate in salt bridges, like what has been observed in X1BRCTb for the homologous residues

(6). V873 and A874 coincide in the X1BRCTb structure with homologous valine and alanine residues that flank a threonine residue, which acts as central pivot point for the asymmetric dimer interface. To shed more light on the oligomeric state of L3[86], measurements of the 15N longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates (Table S1, Supporting Information) were used to determine the overall rotational correlation time, c. An experimental c value of 6.82 ( 1.003 ns was determined from trimmed (average values within one standard deviation) R1/R2 values. Empirical and theoretical estimates of c based on correlations between c and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) for a set of structures of proteins having similar molecular masses (10 kDa) (46) were 4.35 ( 0.05 and 3.55 ( 0.11 ns, respectively. The calculated c value, on the other hand, based on the structure determined here and using the beads model theory of Garcia de la Torre and Bloomfield is 5.39 ns. The experimental c value of 6.82 ( 1.003 ns that was obtained, which is greater than the estimated or calculated value, is consistent with L3[86] forming a dimer in solution. 15N Backbone Relaxation Data. Residue-specific 15N R 1 and R2 relaxation rates and 15N-{1H} NOE values were measured for 82 residues (excluding the six prolines and including the two non-native N-terminal glycine and serine residues) observed in the 15N-HSQC spectrum. The experimental values of R1, R2, and NOE are plotted versus residue number in Figure 2, and the values are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. The average values of R1 and R2 for all 82 residues are 0.93 ( 0.8 and 19.5 ( 1.9 s-1, respectively, and 0.87 ( 0.04 and 20.5 ( 1.2 s-1, respectively, when the highly flexible N-terminal residues (835845) were excluded. The variation pattern in the relaxation parameters closely follows the variability in the conformational space of L3[86] as determined by the NOE restraints. For example, the N-terminus of L3[86] has the fewest NOE constraints per residue (Figure 3), in agreement with the low {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE values (Figure 2c). The remaining residues do not exhibit large deviations from the average R1, R2, and heteronuclear NOE values, with the exception of the residues located in the long loop connecting

3 and 4. Smaller {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE values in this region correspond to smaller R2 and larger R1 values (Figure 2, and Table S1 of the Supporting Information). In particular, residues G893 and S894, which immediately follow 3, exhibit {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE values of <0.5. To determine the time scales at which specific dynamic motions were occurring, the R1, R2, and NOE values were further analyzed using reduced spectral density mapping. Plots of the spectral density function, J(), values at three frequencies (0, N, and 0.87H; Figure 2d-f) suggest that high-frequency motions (N and H) in the nanosecond time scale range do not vary much from residue to residue (Figure 2d,e). In contrast, slow motions (0) on the millisecond to microsecond time scale range are more variable across the protein backbone (Figure 2f), and the differences are more pronounced for both the N-terminal segment and the loop connecting 3 to 4. In general, however, the variation patterns in J(0), J(N), and J(0.87H) are similar to those observed in R2, R1, and 15N-{1H} NOE, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information). The lack of significant residue-specific differences in the intramolecular motions, as in the case of L3[86], allows the use of J() values to estimate the square of the order parameter (S2), which measures the amplitude of the internal motion and its time scale (m) (Figure 4b,c, and Table S2 of the Supporting Information). The majority of residues have S2 values close to 1, which indicates that they are highly ordered (Figure 4c). However, the R1/R2 values plotted in Figure 4a do show a moderate variation in the backbone dynamics and suggest that certain regions, such as R2, are less flexible than others, in agreement with the slow amide exchange rates (Figure 1). In addition, the R2 helix contains two tryptophan residues (W908 and W910) that exhibit dynamical differences. Whereas W908 is a highly conserved residue in the BRCT family and a mutation of the homologous tryptophan (W1837) to an arginine in the BRAC1 protein is known to predispose patients to cancer, W910 is not conserved (6). Relaxation parameters of the indole NH vector of both tryptophans are close to each other (Table 1), suggesting that they both undergo very similar motions on the nanosecond time scale. The R2 values are identical and close to that observed for several other backbone amide vectors (Table S1, Supporting Information), showing that the differences in motions occurring on the microsecond time scale are also negligible. In contrast, significant differences in the amide proton exchange behavior are observed. While

the indole proton resonance of W910 is unobservable in the first HSQC spectrum obtained approximately 150 min after the H-D exchange, the W908 indole NH could be monitored for at least 3 days. If a first-order exchange process is assumed, an exponential fit to the experimental data produces an exchange rate of (4.45 ( 0.02) × 10-3 min-1 for the W908 indole NH (Figure 5). Numerous medium- and longrange NOE cross-peaks were observed from the indole proton of W908 to several surrounding conserved residues (L918, V919, A920, P921, and C922), as well as to a highly conserved cysteine (C912). In fact, W908 displays the greatest number of NOEs per residue (Figure 3). The H-D and NOE results are consistent with W910 being located on

Structure and Dynamics of the Ligase IIIR BRCT Domain the surface and accessible to solvent exchange, while W908 is buried in the hydrophobic core of the structure of the protein. This suggests that one potential structural consequence of mutations involving the conserved W908 would be to hinder the formation of a properly folded BRCT domain. Structure Determination. Elements of regular secondary structure were identified on the basis of three criteria: (1) NOE patterns, (2) the three-bond J coupling between the amide and HR protons (3JNHR), and (3) the amide proton solvent-exchange rates (Figure 1). Chemical shift indices (CSI) for HR, CR, CO, and C resonances were also determined and used to confirm the secondary structure assignments (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The results indicate the presence of two R-helices [R1 (residues F865A874) and R2 (residues E907-R914)] and four -strands [ 1 (residues R855-L858), 2 (residues D878-V880), 3 (residues H890-L892), and 4 (residues Q902-S905)] (Figure 1). Helices R1 and R2 are defined by NOEs between HRi and HNi+3 and between HRi and H i+3 (45) and by their CSI values. The -strands were determined primarily from the CSI values (47) and by the absence of strong NOEs between HNi and HNi+1, which suggests extended structures (45). The parallel 2 1 3 4 strand alignment for the -sheet was defined by the long-range NOEs between the amide proton of a residue in one strand and the HR proton of a residue in its neighboring strand. A total of 36 slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from the 15N-HSQC spectrum acquired approximately 6 h after solvent exchange with D2O (Figure 1). Twenty-seven of these residues are located in regions having defined secondary structure and provide the 54 hydrogen bonding restraints used in the structure calculations [Figure 1 (b)]. The secondary structure of N-terminal residues A837-V854 is not well-defined and appears to be disordered, as indicated by the CSI values (Figure S1, Supporting Information) and the smaller number of NOEs observed for this region (Figure 3). However, some unusual characteristics (backbone relaxation parameters and slow amide exchange) are evident for several residues in this segment. Residues A837-T844 exhibit partial helical character as evidenced by the presence of HRi to H i+3 medium-range NOEs. Still, they show neither the expected HRi to HNi+3 connectivities nor the CSI for an R-helix (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Although exchange cross-peaks were not observed, these results may be partially explained by a fast conformational exchange between a helix and coil. This would result in the average structure of a poorly defined helix being observed on the NMR time scale. The 1H-NOESY, 13C-edited NOESY, and 15N-edited NOESY spectra yielded a total of 979 unique NOE-derived upper distance limits (Table 2 and Figure 3). An additional 54 hydrogen bond distance restraints and 25 dihedral angle restraints were also acquired for a total of 12.5 restraints per residue (Table 2). These restraints, along with the chemical shift assignments, can be found as PDB entry 1IMO. A final family of 20 structures out of 299 calculated in DYANA had the lowest number of restraint violations (Figure 6). A distribution of the calculated structures as a function of the final target energy values shows that the 20 final structures also exhibited the lowest energy values. This

family of 20 structures has an average rmsd of 0.58 ( 0.15 Å for backbone atoms and 1.18 ( 0.18 Å for all residues from A837 to C922 (Table 2). The average rmsd from the mean structure for the backbone heavy atoms (residues 855905, omitting the residues in the disordered N-terminus, the 3- 4 loop, and the C-terminus) is 0.27 ( 0.09 Å for backbone atoms and 1.10 ( 0.21 Å for all the heavy atoms. None of the distance or dihedral angle violations were greater than 0.3 Å or 5.0°, respectively, in the structure family. Ramachandran plot analysis in PROCHECK-NMR (43) shows that of the residues located in the secondary structure region of the protein, 72.2% of the  and  angles lie within the most favored region, 27.8% in the additionally favored region, and none in the generously allowed or disallowed regions (Figure S2, Supporting Information). When all the residues are considered, 49.1% lie within the most favored region and 41.9% in the additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Those residues with  and  angles falling within the generously allowed or disallowed regions are generally located in the disordered parts of the structures, with no consensus among the family members for any particular residue to be within the disallowed region. As expected, however, surface-exposed side chains, especially those from arginine and lysine, tend to show the greatest disorder and subsequently are the residues most frequently found in the disallowed region. Description of the Structure. L3[86] forms a compact R/ structure consisting of a core four-stranded parallel -sheet with a 2 1 3 4 strand order and two R-helices (R1 and R2) packed against one side of the sheet. Two large loops ( 2- 3 and 3- 4) are located on the opposite face of the -sheet (Figure 6). The first several residues in the N-terminal domain adopt a poorly defined helical turn that forms hydrophobic packing interactions with R2. The overall topology is 1R1 2 3 4R2. To visualize the backbone dynamics of L3[86], the order parameter (Figure 4) deter-

mined from the relaxation experiments and reduced spectral density mapping was superimposed on the protein backbone (Figure 7). The variation in the backbone radius is scaled in proportion to the order parameter. Nanosecond time scale motions are fairly constant, with the largest movements observed for the loop regions and the N-terminal segment. Comparison with Other Structurally Homologous Domains. A search of the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) database (48) yielded several proteins with folds that are homologous to the L3[86] fold, though they all exhibit very low levels of sequence homology. In these cases, the minimal structural motif that defined similarity to the structure of L3[86] is the core four-stranded parallel -sheet with a 2 1 3 4 order with a two-helix bundle packed against one face of the -sheet. The minimal structural motif happens to coincide with the most conserved regions of the BRCT family (2, 5). The major difference between the

structures of L3[86] and these structural homologues was the presence of one or more additional helices located on the opposite face of the -sheet. These structural elements were also found to be the least conserved in the BRCT family (2, 5). In all cases but one, this fold was found to stabilize orderly self-associations to higher oligomeric states by specific protein-protein interactions. For example, 60 -subunits of lumazine synthase (PDB entry 1rvv) interact predominantly though their R-helices to form an icosahedral shell (49). Similarly, the caspase-like N-terminal domain of the gingipain R protein [PDB entry 1cvr (50)] and the catalytic domain of malonyl-CoA ACP transacylase [PDB entry 1mla (51)] interact through their R-helices to form dimers. Another example of a protein-protein interaction module with a similar fold is the structure of X1BRCTb (6), which is the binding partner of L3[86] (52) (Figure 8). Three major differences in sequence between L3[86] and X1BRCTb are that L3[86] is nine residues longer at the N-terminus, eight residues shorter at the C-terminus, and missing the ten residues comprising the X1BRCTb R2 helix, the sequence of which is the least conserved among the BRCT family (23). The sequences and structural positions of the L3[86] and X1BRCTb R1 helices, as well as the packing alignment between R1 and R2 (X1BRCTb R3), are also conserved. The interhelical angle between these helices is 36.2° in L3[86] and 43.2° in X1BRCTb. Like the interactions observed between R1 and R3 in the X1BRCTb structure, the L3[86] R1 L868, Y871, and V873 residues form hydrophobic packing interactions with the R2 I909 and W910 residues. The difference in the overall solvent accessible surface area between the structures of X1BRCTb (5920 Å2) and L3[86] (4853.1 Å2) (calculated from the average structure) reflects two differences that distinguish the structures, namely, the number of helices (three R-helices vs two) and the difference in the length of R1 (Figure 8).

FIGURE 8: Comparison of the structures of (A) X1BRCTb (6) and (B) L3[86] ( -strands in cyan and R-helices in red and gold). Views are positioned so that the two conserved helices (R1 and R2 in L3[86] and R1 and R3 in X1BRCTb) are aligned. The highly conserved residues W908 and C910 in L3[86] and W611 and C615 in X1BRCTb are shown in blue. The three major differences between the structures are highlighted by the matching colored boxes. The nine-residue longer N-terminal region in L3[86] is able to fold back and make contacts with R2 (magenta). The R1 helix is four residues shorter in the L3[86] structure (blue). The entire X1BRCT R2 sequence and corresponding helix is missing in the L3[86] structure (green).

One other class of proteins that have folds similar to that of L3[86], but do not participate in protein-protein interactions, are the repair proteins uracil-DNA glycosylase [PDB entry 1akz (53)] and G:T/U mismatch specific DNA glycosylases. Interestingly, unlike the helix-helix contacts that were found to predominate in forming the protein-protein interactions, a hydrophobic pocket composed of the -sheet and flanking helices binds the looped out uracil base in the crystal structure of the uracil-DNA glycosylase-DNA complex (PDB entry 1emh). In addition, the glycosylases adopt monomeric structures. We find that the 2 1 3 4 parallel sheet with a two-helix bundle unit is a highly conserved structural scaffold. The examples given here of proteins that exhibit similar structural folds but have a wide range of functions imply that sequence differences are important in specifying the type of interactions that these folds enable. It will be interesting to determine if other BRCT domains adopt similar core structures and to relate how both structure and sequence differences are used to provide partner specificity. Potential Protein-Protein Interaction Surface. Previously, we prepared two different heterocomplexes of the XRCC1/ L3 BRCT domains for biophysical characterization to provide insight into the interaction between these two BRCT binding partners (23). Unfortunately, the NMR data for the complexes exhibited narrow lines mixed with very broad lines, which hindered detailed structural studies. Size-exclusion chromatography studies show that both complexes elute as dimers at low concentrations and as tetramers (homodimers of L3 BRCT and X1BRCTb) at the high concentrations (9 mg/ mL) needed for NMR studies (23). Higher-order aggregates were also observed at very high concentrations (23 mg/mL). The formation of a tetrameric L3[86]-X1BRCTb complex implies that the homodimer and the heterodimer interfaces cannot be the same. However, this result directly contradicts a recent combined modeling and mutation study of a X1BRCTb-L3 BRCT complex which predicts that the heterodimer and homodimer interfaces are the same (54). In contrast, Taylor et al. (52) have identified a different region, comprised of the region centered around the 2- 3 loop, residues 573-592 in X1BRCTb, as the minimal region that binds to L3R. An obvious next step in our investigations

will be to better define these regions and their involvement in complex formation.
