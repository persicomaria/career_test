Highthroughput Factory RIKEN Harima Institute, 1-1-1 Kouto, Mikazuki-cho, Sayo-gun Hyogo 679-5148, Japan The X-ray crystallographic structure of osmotically inducible Protein C from the thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8, was solved ° to 1.6 A using the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method and a selenomethionine incorporated protein (Se-MAD). The crystal ° ° space group was P1 with cell dimensions of a ¼ 37.58 A, b ¼ 40.95 A, ° c ¼ 48.14 A, a ¼ 76.98, b ¼ 74.08 and g ¼ 64.18. The two tightly interacting monomers in the asymmetric unit are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold. The dimer structure is defined primarily by two very long antiparallel, over-lapping a-helices at the core, with a further six-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet on the outside of the structure. With respect to the b-sheets, both A and B monomers contribute three strands each resulting in an intertwining of the structure. The active site consists of two cysteine residues from one monomer and an arginine and glutamic acid from the other. Enzymatic assays have revealed that T. thermophilus OsmC has a hydroperoxide peroxidase activity.

Introduction
Non-sporulating bacteria have evolved a number of mechanisms to deal with environmental stress including that of heat, oxidative agents and osmotic shock.1 ­ 3 The response to different types of stress is complex, involving the overlapping expression of multiple genes. The expression of the osmC gene was first demonstrated in Escherichia coli in response to osmotic shock.4 The resultant protein is therefore referred to as osmotically inducible protein C. The distribution of the gene ¨ was examined by Volker et al.5 and was found in a number of bacterial species as one or two copies. They found the gene in the Bacillus, Mycoplasma, Acinetobacter, Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, and Deinococcus species examined, but not in the

Haemophilus, Heliobacter or Synechocystis species examined. Although the function of the protein remains unknown, where the gene was found it was highly conserved. Regulation of OsmC has been shown to be very complex in both E. coli6 ­ 8 and Bacillus subtilus.5 Related through moderate (20%) levels of identity are the organic hydroperoxide resistance genes (ohr). An analysis by Atichartpongkul et al.9 revealed that these genes define two families with distinct functions and patterns of expression. This was based primarily on sequence analysis, which revealed distinct patterns of conservation. This analysis reassigned some of the osmC genes identi¨ fied by Volker et al.5 as ohr and further expanded the number of bacterial species where the genes were or were not found. Of interest are the conserved cysteine residues found across the two families. Further, Atichartpongkul et al.9 demonstrated that mutations of the ohr gene but not the osmC gene resulted in decreased plating efficiency in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t BOOH), which could be recovered through complementation by a plasmid containing the ohr gene but not by one containing the osmC gene.

960 other hand Conter et al.10 demonstrated that an OsmC mutant strain of E. coli was sensitive to H2O2 and t BOOH. They suggest that the OsmC functions to defend against oxidative compounds, either directly or indirectly. The expression of the ohr gene was previously shown to be induced by organic peroxides but not other oxidants.11 A kinetic analysis along with the X-ray crystallographic structure of the hydroperoxide resistance protein (Ohr) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recently published by Lesniak et al.12 The Ohr protein was shown to catalyze H2O2, t BOOH and cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) with the two cysteine residues postulated to be oxidized and form a disulfide bond. Here we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of osmotically inducible protein C from ° Thermus thermophilus HB8 solved to 1.6 A resolution and discuss its structure with respect to that of the Ohr protein. A comparison of the active sites leads to speculation of the OsmC protein's function and with that in mind kinetic studies were carried out. This is the first structure of a member of the OsmC family and the first demonstration of catalytic activity of a member of this family.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure The structure was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method using a SeMet-substituted recombinant protein. The crystal space group was P1 with cell dimen° ° ° sions of a ¼ 37.58 A, b ¼ 40.95 A, c ¼ 48.14 A, a ¼ 76.98, b ¼ 74.08 and g ¼ 64.18. There are two molecules of 142 amino acid residues each in the asymmetric unit of which all but the N-terminal methionine residues were built in. The R-factor for ° the final model to 1.6 A is 17.8% with an Rfree of 23.2%. Refinement statistics are given in Table 1. An analysis using PROCHECK showed that 92.4% of the residues were in the most favored region with the remaining residues in additionally allowed regions. The quality of the electron density maps was excellent as demonstrated in Figure 1. Alternate conformations of residues Ser65 and Ser77 of both the A and B chain were modelled and also for ValA9, ThrA100, IleB50, and MseB60. The Cys57 is oxidized to a cysteine sulfinic acid (see Figure 1(b)). One Tris molecule, found in the crystallization conditions, was also bound at a

position where crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry interactions were present. It does not affect the active site. The model contains 213 water molecules. The model consists of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit related by a near-perfect noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. The two monomers are effectively intertwined with three b-strands from both contributing to a six-stranded b-sheet on the outside of the dimer structure. See Figure 2 for the labelling of the secondary structural elements and their correspondence to the OsmC sequence. The structure is further defined by a long a-helix (a2) separating the two groups of b-sheets described above with the 2-fold axis close

to the interacting N-terminal ends of the helix. Also very near the 2-fold axis is a short a-helical segment (a4) which along with a longer segment a3 and the long central a2 make up half of an a-helical core (the other half being provided by the other monomer). Figure 3(a) is the dimer structure viewed down the 2-fold axis rotated slightly to demonstrate the extended b-sheet with its contribution from the two monomers. With the two chains of different colors the intertwined nature of the structure is clearly shown. The structure requires both monomers to be stable and as will be described both contribute to the active site. Dynamic light-scattering measurements show that OsmC is mono-dispersed with a molecular mass

of 31 kDa. This suggests that the protein forms a dimer in solution as well as the crystal and that the above dimer is the biological unit. The isolated monomer is shown in Figure 3(b) with an orientation designed to demonstrate the long central a-helix and the larger of the two b-sheets. This b-sheet (orange) is a mixture of anti-parallel (b4 and b5) and parallel (b5 and b6), while the small (green) b-sheet is anti-parallel (b1, b2 and b3). The resultant six-stranded b-sheet is mainly anti-parallel, the exception being b6. Comparison with the Ohr fold Atichartpongkul et al.9 revealed that the Ohr and OsmC, though related through moderate levels of identity, have distinct functions and patterns of expression. Sequence alignment of the OsmC protein reported here and the recently solved Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ohr protein12 is shown in Figure 2. The long central a-helix (a2) is strongly conserved in Ohr and OsmC, and the secondary structure towards the C-terminal, although showing some variation, is very much more conserved than that towards the N-terminal. Using the central a-helix to align the three-dimensional structures reflects the observations noted with the sequence and secondary structure alignment, but also reveals large changes in the loop structures both upstream and downstream from the helix. Figure 4 shows the two overlapped structures with the N-terminal region in the upper-left and the C-terminal region in the lower-left. The variation is quite strongly demonstrated when one considers the extended N-terminal region of the Ohr protein even though the sequence length of the two proteins is the same. The excess is compensated by the much larger loop between the first two b-strands (b1 and b2) in the OsmC structure. When both monomers are considered, the dimer structure has a relatively well conserved central a-helical core and a less well conserved six-stranded b-sheet. With both the OsmC and Ohr proteins the dimer is considered to be the biological unit. Active site Alignment of the Ohr/OsmC super-family shows that two cysteine residues are conserved throughout.9 The paper on the structure of the Ohr protein12 demonstrated its peroxidase activity and postulated a mechanism involving the transient oxidation of the conserved Cys60 followed by the rapid formation of a disulfide bond with the conserved Cys124. If the catalytic mechanism between the Ohr and the OsmC families is the same then in the OsmC protein we expect an oxidation of Cys57 followed by disulfide bond formation with Cys123. The transient oxidized form of cysteine (cysteine sulfenic acid), if the formation of a disulfide bond cannot occur, would undergo further oxidation to form cysteine

sulfinic acid. In fact it is the latter form of cysteine that we see in the OsmC structure. Lesniak et al.12 also discussed the importance of Glu50 and Arg18 with respect to catalysis.

However, while Glu50 is strongly conserved throughout the super-family (Glu47 in OsmC), the arginine is not. Members of the Ohr and OsmC families were classified based on their sequence similarities9 and revealed clear patterns of conservation of which the Arginine pattern is one. Figure 5(a) demonstrates the orientation of the two catalytic cysteine residues along with Glu50 and Arg18 within the Ohr structure. A salt bridge is formed between the Glu50 and Arg18 side° ° chains (NH1­ O11, 2.8 A; NH2 ­O12, 2.8 A), and the latter residue is in close proximity to Cys60 ° (N1 ­CysCb, 4.3 A). The Ohr protein was crystallized with the reducing agent DTT and an oxygen from this molecule forms a further hydrogen bond to Arg18 N1. An examination of the three-dimensional structure of the OsmC protein reveals that the role of the Arg18 in the Ohr structure is replaced by the Arg37 (see Figure 5(b)). Although the hydrogenbonding pattern is different, the conserved glutamic acid still forms a salt bridge to the active ° ° site arginine (N1 ­ O11, 2.9 A; NH2 ­O12, 2.7 A) and therefore the role of the glutamic acid appears unchanged. The Arg37 residue is completely conserved in the OsmC sequences but unconserved in the Ohr sequences. Interestingly, the sequence alignment of the solved Ohr and OsmC proteins shows that the Arg37 is conserved in this instance, and in the case of Arg18 the Ohr sequence is only replaced by a lysine. In the latter case, although positively charged, the lysine cannot form the complex hydrogen bonding pattern seen in the Ohr structure. More importantly, the main chain conformations of the two families, around these residues, are completely divergent. Looking at these two

sequences in isolation one cannot help wonder as to the cause of the structural divergence. The conservation of the Glu-Arg-Cys-Cys pattern, especially in light of this divergence, not only emphasizes the importance of these residues but strongly suggests that the catalytic roles of the two families are much more similar than previously thought.9 The affect of the structural divergence can be more clearly seen in Figure 6, which shows a detailed view of residues surrounding the two cysteine residues in both structures. Several residues are common to both OsmC and Ohr proteins, while others are unique to members of the OsmC family (Figure 2). As mentioned previously a direct comparison is difficult as the loop structure in this area differs between the two families. Phe58 is almost completely conserved between the two families as is Ala61 and Ser126. The Og of the latter is hydrogen bonded to the N1 of His54, which is conserved in the OsmC family but replaced by tyrosine in the Ohr family. Other examples of differences include Val124, which is conserved in OsmC but replaced by tyrosine in the Ohr family. One interesting point is the OsmC conserved Trp10*, Tyr32* and Met60 (not found in the Ohr family), which not only provide a hydrophobic patch but effectively block access of Lys18* (catalytic Arg18* in Ohr) to the active site. Here and below the * refers to the second monomer of the dimer structure. As previously mentioned Cys57, in the crystal structure, is in an oxidized form (Csd57, cysteine sulfinic acid). One of the side-chain oxygen atoms forms a strong hydrogen bond with ° ° the Arg37* (2.8 A to NH1 and 2.5 A to NH2) while the second forms hydrogen bonds to the ° amide nitrogen atoms of Val125 (2.8 A) and Ser126 ° ). Is this a transition state or indicative of the (3.1 A fact that the disulfide bond cannot be formed? Modelling indicates that a simple rotation of the Cys123 chi1 angle can bring the two cysteine residues of the OsmC structure close enough to form a disulfide bond (Cys57 Sb ­Cys123 Cb, ° 3.9 A). It appears from the network of hydrogen bonds that the Arg18* and Glu47* are involved in stabilizing the cysteine sulfenic acid and preventing disulfide bond formation. Whether this is in fact happening or indeed the significance of the observation is not clear. The main chain divergence around the active site also has implications with respect to accessibility of substrate (see Figure 7). With OsmC, Cys123 is completely open to the solvent while Cys57 is less accessible. Residues Arg37* and Glu47* are almost completely buried. This relationship is reversed in the Ohr protein with Cys60, Arg18* and Glu50* accessible to solvent and Cys124 completely buried. In the latter case the Cys60 sits at the bottom of a cleft and blocks access to Cys124. In the Ohr structure the reductant DTT also covers Cys60. In the main, it is differences in the loop structure between b4 and b5 (Pro90), between b1

and b2 (Arg15), and the positioning of b3 that are responsible for determining access to the cysteine residues. The third b-strand (b3) fills the cleft seen in the Ohr structure, while residues Pro90* and Arg15* restrict solvent access to Cys57, Arg37* and Glu47*. Figure 7 also demonstrates the large difference in the general topology of the active site. The two cysteine residues of the OsmC protein are in a very shallow cleft when compared to the

Ohr protein. Could the substrate for OsmC be much larger than that for Ohr? Lesniak et al.12 in a detailed discussion of a potential catalytic mechanism of the Ohr protein suggest that the greater reactivity of the Cys60 as opposed to Cys124 is due not only to its proximity to arginine but also steric consideration with the former coming into contact with the substrate first. In the OsmC structure both cysteine residues have a greater

degree of side-chain rotational freedom than with the Ohr structure, resulting in Cys57 still being quite accessible. Although in the OsmC structure it appears that substrate would first come into contact with Cys123, steric considerations do not play an important role. The Cys57, made more reactive by the active site arginine and glutamic acid, would react with the substrate first, followed by a disulfide bond formation with Cys123. Peroxidase activity It was postulated from the OsmC crystal structure that the protein is a hydroperoxidase and functions in a similar way to Ohr. Consequently, peroxidase activity of OsmC was measured by the ferrous oxidation in xylenol (FOX) assay, which determines the peroxide concentration in the reaction mixture. The decrease in hydroperoxide concentration was analyzed to obtain the reaction rate. Recombinant OsmC processed hydro-

peroxides, CHP, t BOOH, and H2O2 in the presence of DTT. The DTT acted as reductant with no enzyme reaction in its absence. We confirmed that the reaction rates were increased in a time- and OsmC concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). These results show that OsmC is a peroxidase catalyzing the same reaction as Ohr (i.e. H2O2 is converted into water; CHP and t BOOH are converted into corresponding alcohols). This is a first report that OsmC is an enzyme and an organic hydroperoxide peroxidase. We examined the substrate concentrationdependency of the enzyme reaction (Figure 8). Approximate Km values for CHP, t BOOH, and H2O2 are in the 1 ­3 mM range, 1 ­3 mM range, and 1­ 2 mM range, respectively. Maximum activities for CHP and t BOOH were comparable, while that for H2O2 was about half. Comparing the Km values to those of Ohr, the Km value of OsmC for CHP was approximately two to three orders of magnitude higher. The high Km value compared to Ohr suggests that substrates other than CHP and t BOOH exist. Reactivity to H2O2 is very different between OsmC and Ohr. Compared with CHP and t BOOH, H2O2 is a very poor substrate for Ohr. However, with respect to OsmC all three substrates had similar activity. Ohr has a deep active site cleft when compared to OsmC (Figure 7). The hydrophobic environment around the deep cleft of Ohr might be suitable for small hydrophobic molecules like CHP and t BOOH but might be inappropriate for the more polar H2O2. Due to its shallow cleft, OsmC might be able to metabolize diverse kinds of hydroperoxides. The question remains as to how bacteria use these two kinds of organic hydroperoxide peroxidases? The expression and induction pattern of these two genes are distinct even in a bacteria that has both Ohr and OsmC.9 Thus OsmC is suggested to have a different function from Ohr. Considering the shallower active site cleft leads us to imagine that OsmC catalyzes larger organic hydroperoxides than CHP. This might be the functional distinction between OsmC

and Ohr, both of which metabolize exogenous hydroperoxides. So far the actual biological reductant for both OsmC and Ohr also remains to be elucidated. The DTT used for the assays of both OsmC and Ohr is not a natural reductant in bacterial metabolism. A search for a biological reductant that reduces the oxidized cysteine residues in OsmC is ongoing along with a search for the actual biological substrate. Reaction mechanism The similar active site conformation (Glu-ArgCys-Cys) of Ohr and OsmC suggests that the reaction mechanism is the same as that proposed for Ohr. We therefore propose the following reaction mechanism for OsmC (see Figure 9).

Conclusion
We have revealed the X-ray crystallographic structure of OsmC. The structure strongly suggests a similar catalytic function to Ohr, an organic hydroperoxide peroxidase. This was further demonstrated through our kinetic studies. The cellular function of OsmC remains elusive. There seems no connection between conditions stimulating its expression (osmotic shock) and a peroxidase function. OsmC can detoxify hydroperoxides into alcohols, suggesting that the OsmC functions for cellular defence against the oxidative stress. Our structure and enzyme activity data may provide a new insight into relationships between oxidative stress and osmotic shock.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification Purification, expression and crystallization of the seleno-methionine substituted protein have been described.13 Briefly, the protein was expressed in E. coli cells and purified through heat treatment followed by successive application to SuperQ Toyopearl 650M (Tosoh), Resource Q (Amersham-Biosciences) and CHT10-I (BIO-RAD) columns. Intermediate desalting was performed with a HiPrep 26/10 column (Amersham-Biosciences); final desalting used a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (Amersham-Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris ­ HCl, 50 mM NaCl (pH 8.0). Native protein used in the kinetic studies was purified in a similar fashion with the exception of 1 mM DTT being used throughout. In the case of the native protein, the gene was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and did not require induction of expression. The cells were grown in 2.5 l of LB broth resulting in 25 mg of protein concentrated to 64 mg/ml. Crystallization and data collection Crystals were grown using the sitting-drop method mixing 1 ml of protein solution with 1 ml of a reservoir solution containing 100 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 8.4) and 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000. Small crystals appeared after a few days but became suitable for diffraction experiments only after several months. These

(1) A hydroperoxide directly reacts with the Cys57 thiol group and is reduced to its corresponding alcohol. Cys57 is oxidized to cysteine-sulfenic acid (-SOH). (2) The Cys57-SOH immediately forms a disulfide bond with Cys123, releasing a water molecule (Cys57-SOH þ HS-Cys123 ! Cys57S-S-Cys123 þ H2O). (3) The disulfide bond is reduced to become its enzymatically active form by an unknown reductant. In the assay this role is provided by DTT. Cys60 thiol of Ohr, which corresponds to Cys57 of OsmC, is polarized by Arg18*. The polarized and ionized (-S-) state is more reactive to hydroperoxides than the unionized state. As previously discussed, the role of Arg18* of Ohr is replaced by Arg37* in OsmC. This latter residue is in proximity to Cys57 and probably plays a role in polarizing the Cys57 thiol. The polarizing effect of the arginine is enhanced by the hydrogen bonding of the glutamic acid carboxyl group to the arginine guanidine group in both OsmC and Ohr.

crystals were orthogonally shaped and 0.1 mm £ 0.2 mm £ 0.2 mm in size. The buffer surrounding the crystals was changed to a cryo-protectant buffer of 100 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.4), 30% PEG 4000 and 30% PEG 400 through the addition, initially of reservoir solution (8 ml) followed by increasing amounts of cryo-protectant buffer (2­ 5 ml) coupled with removal of excess drop solution. The crystals were mounted to cryoloops then flash frozen under a N2 stream at 100 K. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data were collected at the synchrotron beamline BL-26a at Spring-8 (Harima, Japan) using an ADSC Quantum 4 ° CCD detector. Five data sets were collected to 1.6 A from a single crystal using wavelengths determined from a selenium absorption spectrum: the peak ° ° (0.97894 A), two inflection points (0.97910 A and ° ° 0.97920 A), a high energy remote (0.97500 A), and a low ° energy remote (1.0000 A). Intensity data were processed and scaled using DTREK14 and are summarized in Table 1. Structure determination and model refinement Attempts to solve the OsmC structure through molecular replacement using programs found in the CNS15 and CCP416 suite of programs, and the Ohr structure12 as model, failed. Therefore the attempt using Se-MAD was undertaken. The X-ray structure of the protein was solved using phases derived using all five wavelengths of the Se-MAD experiment. The program SOLVE17 was used to find four of the possible six selenium sites and obtain the initial protein phases. The remaining two sites correspond to the Nterminal methionine and were expected to be disordered. The program RESOLVE18 was used to improve phases through density modification and place approximately 50% of the residues. The remainder of the structure was built and modified by the program QUANTA (Accelyrs). Early refinement, including phase combination, simulated annealing, and non-crystallographic symmetry in the initial stages, was carried out using CNS.15 Final stages of refinement were carried out using REFMAC16,19using the Peak data set (see Table 1). Stereochemical analysis of the structure was performed by PROCHECK.20 Figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT21, BOBSCRIPT22, RASTER3D23 and 24 GRASP. Sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTAL W.25 Two regions proved difficult to build. They are the turn region between b4 and b5, which includes a cisaspartic acid (Asp88) and the loop between helices a3 and a4. The latter region is found very close to the noncrystallographic 2-fold and contains one of the two active site cysteine residues. There is very little divergence of the main chain between the two monomers; the significant differences being found only at residues 24 ­ 26 and attributed to crystallographic packing. Enzyme assay The enzyme activity was measured using the ferrous oxidation xylenol (FOX) method.26 Incubation mixture contained the following: 50 mM Hepes ­ NaOH buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mM DTT, OsmC protein, and various concentrations of substrate hydroperoxides. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 950 ml of ice-cold FOX reagent after incubation at 50 8C. The absorbance at 560 nm was read. The amount of hydroperoxide was calculated by

the absorption molar extinction coefficient (1) of 2.24 £ 105 M21 cm21. The initial reaction rate was determined from a time-course of the decrease in the amount of hydroperoxides. Non-enzymatic degradation of hydroperoxides, which was small but not negligible, was subtracted from the whole hydroperoxide decrease to determine the enzyme-dependent fraction. For the determination of kinetic parameters, Enzyme Kinetics Pro (ChemSW) software was used. Dynamic light-scattering measurements The dynamic light-scattering measurements of the purified protein were performed using DynaPro MS/X (Protein Solution). Protein samples (1.0 mg/ml) were prepared in a solution of 20 mM Tris ­ HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 200 mM NaCl. Protein samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for ten minutes before the measurement. The measurements were performed at 18 8C. All data were analyzed using DYNAMICS software (Protein Solutions). Protein Data Bank accession number The atomic coordinates were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the code 1UKK.
