Polyamides composed of N-methylpyrrole (Py), N-methylimidazole (Im) and N-methylhydroxypyrrole (Hp) amino acids linked by b-alanine (b) bind the minor groove of DNA in 1:1 and 2:1 ligand to DNA stoichiometries. Although the energetics and structure of the 2:1 complex has been explored extensively, there is remarkably less understood about 1:1 recognition beyond the initial studies on netropsin and distamycin. We present here the 1:1 solution structure of ImPy ­b ­ Im ­b ­ ImPy ­b-Dp bound in a single orientation to its match site within the DNA duplex 50 -CCAAAGAGAAGCG-30·50 -CGCTTCTCTTTGG-30 (match site in bold), as determined by 2D 1H NMR methods. The representative ensemble of ° 12 conformers has no distance constraint violations greater than 0.13 A ° and a pairwise RMSD over the binding site of 0.80 A. Intermolecular NOEs place the polyamide deep inside the minor groove, and oriented N ­C with the 30 ­ 50 direction of the purine-rich strand. Analysis of the high-resolution structure reveals the ligand bound 1:1 completely within the minor groove for a full turn of the DNA helix. The DNA is B-form ° (average rise ¼ 3.3 A, twist ¼ 388) with a narrow minor groove closing ° in the binding site. The ligand and DNA are aligned down to 3.0­ 4.5 A in register, with each polyamide NH group forming bifurcated hydrogen bonds of similar length to purine N3 and pyrimidine O2 atoms on the floor of the minor groove. Each imidazole group is hydrogen bonded via its N3 atom to its proximal guanine's exocyclic amino group. The important roles of b-alanine and imidazole for 1:1 binding are discussed.

Introduction
High-resolution structural studies of smallmolecule-DNA interactions improve our understanding of molecular recognition processes and aid in the design of sequence-specific DNA-binding ligands. Two global motifs are well-recognized for targeting the minor groove of DNA based on analogues of the N-methylpyrrole-carboxamide

ring (Py) of the natural products netropsin and distamycin. There exist 1:1 and 2:1 ligand-DNA stoichiometries with quite different rules for recognition and, hence, different sequence specificities.1 ­ 3 This ambiguity of sequence targeting by a single ligand, depending on stoichiometry, raises an important design issue for the field.4 The structure and energetics of the 2:1 motif have been characterized extensively;3,5 however, less is understood about 1:1 recognition beyond the initial studies on netropsin and distamycin. Netropsin binds 1:1 in the minor groove of B-form DNA in A/T regions.6 The minor groove of A/T regions is both narrow due to propeller twisting of the basepairs and relatively deep due to lack of the protruding 2-amino group on guanine.7 NMR and X-ray structures of netropsin and distamycin bound to DNA reveal that the two (and three) Py rings fit snugly in the minor groove in a 1:1 complex.1,8,9

NMR Structure of a 1:1 Polyamide:DNA Complex

Residue names are shown below the structure, linked by line segments. Inset: DNA sequence with a dot model of the bound polyamide. DNA residue numbers are indicated in red, along with a dot model of the bound ligand. Filled circles represent imidazole; open circles represent pyrrole; diamonds are for b-alanine; and the half-circle is the dimethylaminopropylamide tail.

Understanding the sequence-dependent microstructure of DNA is a key issue for the field of ligand·DNA interactions. Analysis of numerous B-DNA single-crystal X-ray structures reveals that certain base-base steps are more deformable than others.10 In particular, purine ­purine steps such as A-A and G-A are inclined to be rigid structures with a narrow minor groove and large negative propeller twist. It has been suggested that optimal base stacking is the primary factor governing this feature.11 The single spine of hydration observed in the minor groove of A-tract-like structures is also thought to provide stabilization of this geometry.1,9 Polyamides displace the spine of hydration in a multidentate fashion by forming hydrogen bonds from each amide NH to proximal purine N3 and pyrimidine O2 atoms,1,12,13 which provides a large entropic driving force for binding.14 The narrow minor groove of A-tracts accommodates netropsin and distamycin in a 1:1 complex well, but the plasticity of T-A steps is required in order to expand the minor groove for accommodation of two ligands.2,10 The X-ray structure of netropsin bound as a 1:1 complex to DNA inspired the lexitropsin model, where it was predicted that replacing one or both Py residues in netropsin with N-methylimidazolecarboxamide (Im) would confer G·C recognition by simultaneously alleviating a steric interaction with the C3-H of Py and forming a hydrogen bond from Im-N3 to G-NH2.1 Subsequent footprinting experiments revealed that Im­Py oligoamides tolerated G·C base-pairs, but were not very sequence-specific, presumably due to Im tolerance of A·T base-pairs as well.15 Remarkably, the structural basis for the lexitropsin model, as envisioned in the 1:1 motif, was never verified structurally. In 1989, Wemmer and co-workers made the important observation that distamycin A can bind A·T tracts of DNA in an antiparallel 2:1 fashion, as well as 1:1, even at low ligand/DNA stoichiometries (i.e. Py/Py pairs, as well as Py, prefer A/

T over G/C).2 It was discovered subsequently that the unsymmetrical ring pair Im/Py could distinguish G·C from C·G and both from A·T and T·A.16 Further invention of the new ring pair Hp/ Py completed a recognition code to target all four Watson­ Crick base-pairs of DNA.3,5,13,17 However, certain sequence contexts, most notably those containing 50 -GA-30 and 50 -GNG-30 steps, have emerged as difficult targets for 2:1 binders. The aliphatic amino acid b-alanine (b), previously used to relax the over-curvature of long contiguous aromatic subunits,18 ­ 20 was incorporated between imidazole groups as Im ­ b­ Im to target 50 -GNG-30 successfully.21 In a breakthrough report, the 1:1 motif was revived by Laemmli and co-workers and used to effect phenotypic changes in Drosophila melanogaster by binding to 50 -GAGAA-30 repeats in satellite regions of the fly genome.22 In the Laemmli design, b-alanine residues were used to add flexibility between ring subunits, allowing the Im residues to register optimally with the DNA helix. The resulting molecules bound 1:1 with subnanomolar affinity in a strongly oriented fashion. In order to understand how to better control 1:1 binding, efforts have been made recently to determine the sequence requirements for 1:1 recognition.23 It was found from footprinting studies that Im residues tolerate G/C base-pairs, whereas other residues, including Py and b, are A/T-specific presumably for steric reasons. In the course of these experiments, several observations were made that would require structural data for explanation. In particular we were interested in elucidating the role of b-alanine4,18 as well as the sequence-dependent orientation of the ligand.22,23 In order to understand this unique mode of recognition, we set out to solve the highresolution solution structure of an Im and b-rich polyamide bound to its purine-rich cognate match site in a 1:1 complex. We present here the structure

From the high-resolution structure we are able to observe directly the hydrogen bonds between Im-N3 and G-NH2 in the 1:1 motif.1,15 The role of b-alanine for 1:1 binding in this purine-rich tract is discussed. In addition, the structure reveals a possible explanation for the sequence-dependent orientation of polyamides in the 1:1 motif.

Results
Footprinting and affinity cleavage To simplify the NMR spectral assignments, we screened several truncated polyamides to identify

the minimal complex size that retains the established characteristics of 1:1 polyamide/DNA recognition.23 In the last round of this iterative process of design, synthesis, and characterization, three DNA-binding sites of sequence type 50 -ccAAAGAGAAGAncg-30 (flanking G·C clampsare in lower-case) were examined as candidates for NMR studies, such that the only variable among the sites was the number of A·T base-pairs (An, n ¼ 0; 1, and 2) beyond the N terminus of the polyamide-binding site. To determine binding affinity, site size, and orientation, the DNA sequences were cloned into plasmid pAU20 and characterized in complex with polyamide 1 (Im ­Py ­ b ­Im ­b ­ Im ­Py ­ b-Dp) by DNase I and methidiumpropyl-EDTA (MPE) footprinting, as well as affinity cleavage analysis (Figure 2). Quantitative DNase I footprinting of compound 1 on pAU20 revealed essentially equivalent binding affinities for the three sites at Ka t 2 nM, indicating

signals is observed, as indicated with asterisks in Figure 3, which further confirms a 1:1 ligand to DNA stoichiometry. Terminal base-pair imino resonances were not observed. Spectral assignments Methods for assigning protons in polyamide·DNA complexes have been wellestablished.2,25 ­ 29 The intramolecular DNA crosspeaks were assigned as described:30 16 pairs of H50 /H500 protons were assigned non-stereospecifically. All other non-exchangeable protons were assigned, and all exchangeable protons were assigned except for those on the terminal C1·G26 and C13·G14 base-pairs. Sequential assignments for guanine and thymine imino protons were determined from the NOESY spectrum in protiated solvent. These facilitated the assignment of A-H2 and C-amino protons. The C-amino protons correlate strongly to each other and to the vicinal C-H5 proton, allowing identification of C-H5 ­C-H6 crosspeaks. It is worth pointing out that the process of assigning imino ! amino ! A-2H/CH5/ CH6 was straightforward, and proved essential for the unambiguous assignment of the aromaticH10 region. NOEs were observed between each A-H2 proton and the H10 protons of its 30 -neighbor and its base-paired thymidine's 30 -neighbor. This pattern is indicative of a narrow minor groove.31 The nomenclature for polyamide protons is shown in Figure 1. All polyamide protons were assigned. Amide NH, Py-H3, and Im-H4 protons were assigned on the basis of intra- and intermolecular connectivities, as observed in the NOESY spectrum in H2O. Methylene protons for each b-alanine residue were identified by a unique set of strong intermolecular contacts with each A-H2 proton. Geminal pairs were assigned nonstereospecifically on the basis of the patterns observed in the DQF-COSY and NOESY experiments. Ring H5 protons were identified by contacts to H40 ribose protons as well as strong contacts to the respective proximal N-methyl group. The intermolecular connectivity pattern observed for these protons defines the orientation of each Im and Py residue such that the N-methyl group points out of the groove. Polyamide chemical shift values are similar to those reported by Wemmer and coworkers for 1:1 and 2:1 polyamide complexes.20,26,29 The NOESY spectrum of the 1:1 complex in H2O is shown in Figure 4. Sequential ligand assignments were based on a clear pattern of intermolecular NOEs from ligand protons to assigned DNA protons. Strong intermolecular NOEs between Py-H3 and A-H2 protons, as well as contacts between amide NH and H10 protons in the binding site, orient the polyamide N ­C with respect to the 30 ­ 50 direction of the purine-rich strand. Each polyamide residue contacts H10 , H40 , and/or base protons on both strands of DNA. This is further evidence for 1:1 complex formation in the minor groove with a single binding orientation.

that the additional A·T base-pairs (An) were not necessary to stabilize the complex. MPE and affinity cleavage experiments of compounds 1 and 1E, respectively, show the polyamide bound to its match sequence, 50 -AAAGAGAAG-30 , oriented N ­ C with the 30 ­50 direction of the purine-rich strand. Both experiments show a 30 -shift between upper and lower strands, characteristic of minor groove binding.24 The smallest sequence, 50 -ccAAAGAGAAGcg-30 , was chosen for NMR studies because it retains 1:1 polyamide/DNA binding properties and high affinity. Titration to 1:1 polyamide to DNA stoichiometry The titration of polyamide 1 to the NMR sample of d(CCAAAGAGAAGCG)·d(CGCTTCTCTTTGG) is shown in Figure 3. Chemical shift perturbation in the uncrowded DNA imino region upon addition of polyamide was used to monitor the degree of complex formation. The number of imino peaks doubles upon addition of substoichiometric amounts of polyamide. A single set of imino peaks is restored at a 1:1 polyamide to DNA stoichiometry. Only one set of polyamide

Sequential aromatic to H10 connectivities for the purine-rich strand are shown as dotted lines; those for the pyrimidine-rich strand as continuous lines. Crosspeaks are labeled according to their chemical shifts along v1 (vertical axis, label beside the peak) and along v2 (horizontal axis, label above or below the peak). Labeling conventions for the DNA are the residue name, the residue number, the proton name (e.g. A7H2 ¼ adenine 7, H2 proton); the igand is named as th proton name, the residue number (e.g. NH-7 ¼ amide NH of pyrrole 7). Red asterisks above or below a peak indicate a cross-strand A-2H to H10 NOE (type a distance31).

Selected intermolecular contacts are illustrated in Figure 5, with continuous and broken lines indicating contacts to the floor and walls of the minor groove, respectively. A homogeneous distribution of contacts is observed, which defines the position of the ligand within the minor groove unambiguously. Distance constraints Polyamide binding induces a high dispersion of NOESY crosspeaks. This enabled the identification of a large number of discrete NOEs, which allowed the use of 508 distance constraints for structure calculations. The distribution of experimental constraints is relatively homogeneous throughout the binding region, with fewer constraints for the terminal base-pairs. The majority of constraints were derived from the NOESY spectrum in 2H2O, with an additional 115 distance constraints from the NOESY spectrum in H2O. Methods for converting NOE intensities to upper bound distance constraints are detailed in Experimental. Forty Watson­ Crick hydrogen bond constraints were applied, based on the observed cytosine amino,

and guanosine and thymidine imino chemical shifts in the spectral region indicative of crossstrand hydrogen bonding. The final list of 548 experimental constraints is available from the Brookhaven Data Bank under accession code 1LEJ. Structure calculations Following the approach described by Chazin and co-workers, a significant effort was made during the structure calculations to sample and represent conformational space consistent with the input data.32,33 The starting ensemble of 40 structures, which differ considerably in helical ° geometry (RMSD 3.46 A), were generated using the Nucleic Acids Builder program NAB. These structures were positioned with the polyamide and docked using a restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) simulated annealing (SA) protocol in the AMBER 6.0 software package.34 The docked ° structures converged to an RMSD of 1.37 A, and subsequent rMD SA did not improve the total

Discussion
Confirmation of oriented 1:1 binding Several independent measurements confirm formation of the 1:1 ligand:DNA complex presented here, in which the polyamide is oriented N ­ C with respect to the 30 ­50 direction of the purinerich strand. The binding isotherm derived from quantitative DNase I footprinting (Figure 2) fits an n ¼ 1 Hill equation.35 The 1D NMR titration (Figure 3) shows the appearance of a single set of polyamide resonances with concomitant shifting of the DNA peaks at 1:1 stoichiometry. By contrast, polyamides that form 2:1 complexes with high cooperativity are known to do so even at low (0.25:1) ligand/DNA ratios, resulting in the existence of two sets of DNA resonances at 1:1 stoichiometry.2,20,26 Additionally, the NOESY spectrum reveals a large number of intermolecular contacts from ligand protons to both strands of DNA with similar intensity. This is in sharp contrast to reported 2:1 complexes, where ligands contact only the proximal strand.2,20,26 The affinity cleavage and MPE footprinting experiments reveal a characteristic 30 -shift of cleavage and protection intensities, respectively, between the upper and lower DNA strands, which is indicative of minor groove binding.24 The existence of cleavage on only one side of the binding site, even when the concentration of the polyamide is much greater than that of the DNA, is evidence for a single binding orientation. The pattern of intermolecular contacts observed in the NOESY spectra (Figures 4 and 5) confirms the

Minor groove width and propeller twist Figure 7 shows plots of minor groove width and propeller twist for the complex, which were calculated using the CURVES program, as described by Lavery and co-workers.37,38 Overall, the complex displays a narrow minor groove and a large negative propeller twist, which are features typically associated with A-tract structures.39 The narrow minor groove is confirmed by the observation of medium-intensity cross-strand NOEs (type a distance31) between each adenine H2 and H10 of its base-paired thymidine's 30 -neighbor (red stars in Figure 4). The minor groove in the structural ensemble is much narrower than observed for ligand-free duplex DNA containing similar sequences-50 -AAAGAA-30 by NMR40 as well as 50 -AAAGAAAA-30 and short A-tracts by X-ray crystallography.41,42 However, it has been proposed that ligand binding in a 1:1 mode can induce the walls of the minor groove to close down to maximize van der Waals contacts.10,43 Large negative propeller twist is commonly associated with a narrow minor groove. Lu and co-workers observe a significant decrease in propeller twist upon

Characterization of the complex Overall features The final ensemble of 12 structures is shown in Figure 6 with the core binding site highlighted in the center. The binding site is well defined, and it consists of the five aromatic residues linked by two flexible b residues (ImPy­ b ­Im­ b ­ImPy). ° The RMSD for the ensemble is 1.12 A, converging ° for all heavy atoms in the binding site to 0.80 A (Table 1). The ends of the DNA as well as the C-terminal b-Dp tail of the polyamide sample a larger region of conformational space, and consequently are defined more poorly. The DNA has ° average B-form values for rise per residue (3.3 A) and inter-base-pair twist (388). Sugar pucker values span the range from C20 -endo to C10 -exo, as observed for A-tract structures,36 with an average phase angle value of 1488.

multiple guanine bases interrupting the short A-tracts. Therefore, this effect is likely to be stabilized by the polyamide as discussed below. Ligand structure Figure 8 displays an axial view of the DNA helix with and without the polyamide shown. It is clear from this perspective that the DNA has a characteristic B-form geometry. The helical axis is relatively straight, and the polyamide wraps completely around the DNA, binding to a full turn of 9.5 base-pairs. The ligand is bound in the minor groove to its cognate nine base-pair match site, as determined by footprinting studies, with Im across from G·C, and Py and b across from A·T base-pairs. The orientation of the polyamide is N­C with the 30 ­50 direction of the purine-rich strand. The core binding site contains b residues in positions 3 and 5 (ImPy ­b3-Im ­ b5-ImPy; see Figure 1). The structural ensemble reveals a single orientation for b5. However, equal populations of two binding modes are observed for b3, which adopts a straight conformation and a bent conformation with virtually identical AMBER energies. We were interested chiefly in assessing the impact of these two conformations on DNA recognition. Therefore, we averaged the coordinates for the five bent and the seven straight conformers within the final ensemble, minimized the mean structures, and then superimposed the flanking Py2 and Im4 rings of the two mean structures. The superposition reveals an interesting result: the two b-alanine conformations do not affect the positioning or relative orientation of the flanking aromatic rings. Specifically, the dihedral angles between the aromatic ring planes of Py2 and Im4 are virtually identical (308 and 338) in spite of the two b-alanine conformations. This result could be attributed to a higher definition of position for b5 from intermolecular NOEs, or it could be that the role of b-alanine is more to provide the flexibility needed for polyamide residues to properly align with DNA base-pairs and less for specific base recognition. Amide ­ DNA interactions In the absence of a ligand, minor groove hydration is thought to stabilize the propeller twisted base-pairs via hydrogen bonding to the N3 and O2 groups on the proximal purine and pyrimidine residues, respectively.44 Netropsin1 and distamycin9 have been observed to replace the spine of hydration by forming bifurcated bonds from each amide NH to the same N3 and O2 atoms in the 1:1 motif. Indeed, we observe this phenomenon. Figure 9 illustrates the interactions observed between ligand NH and purine-N3/ pyrimidine-O2 groups, showing the core binding site of the NMR structure at left with the average (^ standard deviation) distances given in the schema at the right. The amide NH groups to the

Hydrogen bond donor and acceptor pairs are in blue and red, respectively.

Right: Diagram of amide NH to purine N3 and pyrimidine O2 interactions. The DNA is shown as a ladder with each rung containing the residue number as well as purine N3 and pyrimidine O2 atoms indicated by bold N and O, respectively. The ligand is illustrated as a long bar with embedded circles containing the amide NH number, as defined in Figure 1. Broken lines connect NH to N3 and O2 atoms. Average distances over the final 12 structures for these interactions are given in red next to the broken lines, with standard deviations in parentheses.

C-terminal side of each Im residue have longer NH to N3 distances than would be ideal for hydrogen bonding. This small deviation could be due to competition from the Im-N3 to properly hydrogen bond to G-NH2. The distance values are roughly equal from the left to the right side of the minor groove, which shows the relatively central location of the ligand between the two DNA strands on the floor of the minor groove. The distances are also similar along the length of the DNA (top to bottom in Figure 9), attesting to an optimal ligandDNA register along the length of the minor groove between polyamide and DNA residues for a complete turn of the helix. This is evidence for excellent shape complementarity between polyamide and DNA, and it suggests that the driving force for polyamide ­DNA register is the proper alignment of amide NH groups with respect to the DNA base pairs. The lexitropsin model Dickerson and Lown proposed that substitution of one or more Py units in netropsin with Im

should confer G/C specificity in a 1:1 complex.1,15 Attempts have been made to verify this specific interaction in X-ray cocrystal structure analysis of imidazole-containing netropsin analogs with DNA sequences containing G/C base-pairs.45,46 However, Im does not bind across from G in these structures, and therefore the key Im-N3 to G-NH2 hydrogen bond in 1:1 binding has yet to be verified by a high-resolution structure. Considerable X-ray and NMR structural data exist to support the formation of Im-N3 to G-NH2 hydrogen bonds for the Im/Py pair in the 2:1 motif.12,26,27,47 In the 1:1 complex, we find a specific oriented hydrogen bond from Im-N3 to G-NH2. In fact, the ImPy sections of the polyamide presented here are structurally similar to the compounds originally synthesized by Lown and co-workers.15,45 Figure 10 shows a portion of the binding site with polyamide residues Im6-b5Im4 binding across from DNA purine residues G6-A7-G8, respectively. The Im-N3 to G-NH2 hydrogen bonds (Im6-G6 lower left, Im4-G8 upper right) are shown by dotted lines. Hydrogen bonding frequency was tested using the CARNAL module of the AMBER 6.0 software

package.34 The final mean structure was subjected to 15 ps of restrained molecular dynamics at 25 8C, and snapshots of the trajectory were analyzed for ° hydrogen bond formation within 3.3 A N-N distance and 308 N-H· · ·N angle. It was found for 30 snapshots that Im1 and Im6 residues, which are locked into two contiguous ring subunits (i.e. Im1-Py2 and Im6-Py7), form hydrogen bonds with greater frequency (93%) than the central Im4 residue (80%). This result suggests that the central Im4, which is flanked by two b residues, is sampling more conformational space and is therefore more conformationally flexible at room temperature than Im1 and Im6. The importance of b-alanine

We have reported a study in which the Im ­ b ­ Im and Im ­ b ­Py subunits of a 1:1 binding polyamide were replaced with Im ­Py ­ Im and Im ­ Py ­Py, respectively.4 We found that the b to Py substitution was tolerated for Im ­ b­ Py with a small energetic penalty. However the Im ­b ­ Im to Im ­ Py ­Im mutation eliminated specific binding completely. In accordance with b/Py mutation studies in the 2:1 motif, it is likely that the b is

Figure 12. G/C-dependence of polyamide orientation. (a) Schematic illustrating the optimal alignment of polyamide NH groups with the DNA bases and showing that the inherent geometry of the Im residue coupled with the propeller twist of the G/C base-pair allows overlap between Im-N3 and G-NH2 groups. Propeller twisted base-pairs are shown as gray boxes (pyrimidines) crossing over black boxes (purines), with purine labels at the right. The Im-N3 sp2 orbital is shown as its lone pair in red. Guanine's NH2 group is drawn as HN- in blue. The bases are rotated away from the center in order to project the natural 388 twist onto two dimensions.

needed to reset the register for the following (C-terminal) residue.21 It appears that the b residue is necessary for the two flanking Im residues in Im ­ b­ Im to orient properly in order to form hydrogen bonds. The Im ­ b­ Py subunit forms only one Im·G hydrogen bond, and therefore the flexibility is not as critical. This is further supported by the ring ­ ring dihedral angles between the plane of Im4 and the planes of Py2 (Im ­ b­ Py) and Im6 (Im­ b ­Im). Figure 11 shows axial views of these dihedral angles with average values (^ standard deviation) for the 12 structures in the final ensemble. The Im/Py dihedral for Im ­ b­ Py of 338 is similar to the Im ­ Py ­ Py dihedral angles (measured for bolded residues) observed in 2:1 crystal structures.12,13 The Im/Im dihedral angle for Im ­ b­ Im subunit is a significant 178 larger. Although a high-resolution structure has yet to be determined for an Im ­Py ­ Im-containing compound, we suggest that the increase in dihedral for Im ­ b ­Im is due to the need for proper orien-

tation in order to maximize Im-N3 to G-NH2 hydrogen bonding. It is interesting that only one b-alanine conformation is observed in Im4 ­ b5 ­ Im6 versus two degenerate conformers for Py2 ­ b3 ­Im4. f indeed the two b3 conformers are real, it is conceivable that b5 is conformationally constrained due to the propensity of the flanking Im residues to orient properly for hydrogen bond formation and thus force a larger ring ­ring dihedral angle. Footprinting data have provided a partial recognition code for the 1:1 motif,23 whereby Im, Py, and b will bind across from A/T base-pairs, but only Im is able to tolerate G/C. The structure presented here reveals the specific interactions underpinning the Im ­ G specificity and provides the first high-resolution structural model of a b residue in a 1:1 complex with DNA. Strong NOEs are observed from methylene protons in each b residue to the proximal A-H2 proton on the floor of the minor groove, as observed in the 2:1 motif.20

The structural ensemble shows these protons to be in contact directly, with distances in the range of ° 2.3 to 2.5 A. This would suggest a strong steric violation when b is placed across from a G·C basepair, which helps to explain the 20 to 50-fold loss in affinity for this mismatch.23 The Sequence-dependence of ligand orientation Laemmli and co-workers made the remarkable observation that the b-linked polyamides in a 1:1 complex prefer a single orientation, N ­C with respect to the 30 ­50 direction of 50 -AAGAGAAGAG-30 , but in the opposite C ­ N orientation with respect to this strand when the G residues are mutated to C. In the 1:1 complex, the polyamide does not distinguish G·C and C·G basepairs.22,23 On the basis of the structure, we believe that polyamide orientation is governed by a combination of the inherent geometry in the amide-Imamide unit in combination with the negative propeller twisting of base-pairs. We assume that the uniform alignment of amide NH groups observed here is the driving force for the register between polyamide and DNA. The sp2 lone-pair orbital on the Im-N3 atom has an inherently different orientation with respect to the flanking NH groups based on covalent bonding geometry. Due to the propeller twisting of base-pairs, the G-NH2 group is oriented more favorably for interaction with the sp2 orbital of Im-N3 when the polyamide is oriented N ­C with respect to the 30 ­ 50 direction of the G-containing strand. Figure 12 details this model, showing a section of the NMR structure in (b) with a schematic of this orientation shown in (apart A). When the G residues are mutated to C, the lone pair of each Im-N3 will not overlap with G-NH2 (Figure 12(c)) unless the ligand orients in the opposite direction (Figure 12(d)). However, this model does not explain the observation that the polyamide will orient N ­C with the 30 ­50 direction of the poly(dA) tract.

narrow minor groove and a large degree of negative propeller twist, which has been demonstrated to be stabilized by bifurcated hydrogen bonds donated from each polyamide NH group to proximal purine N3 and pyrimidine O2 atoms. Stabilization of the negative propeller twist by this interaction in addition to the inherently rigid and narrow minor groove is thought to be the reason that polyamides would bind 1:1 in A-tract-like sequences, but would have difficulty binding as 2:1. The observed homogeneous register of amide NH groups with respect to the DNA is though to be the driving force for optimal ligand-DNA alignment. If this is so, the previously established G/C-dependent orientation preference of the polyamide could be explained by an inherent asymmetry in the projected angle of the Im-N3 lone pair sp2 orbital with respect to the amide NH groups. Therefore, overlap of this orbital with the propeller-twisted guanine's NH2 group is optimal when the polyamide is oriented N ­C with respect to the 30 ­ 50 direction of the guanine-containing strand. The final structural ensemble reveals specific hydrogen bonds between Im-N3 and G-NH2. The Im to Im dihedral within the Im ­ b ­Im subunit requires a large dihedral angle so that both rings orient properly to form hydrogen bonds. Additionally, we are now able to understand from a structural perspective the observed A/T specificity of b-alanine within the 1:1 motif, based on its close contacts with the floor of the minor groove. These results set the stage for a more critical design of next-generation polyamides for the discrimination of 1:1 versus 2:1 binding modes.

Conclusions
Solution structure determination by NMR is an essential tool for studying molecular recognition phenomena. DNA structure determined by NMR is often poorly defined in the absence of a bound ligand, and in the present study it was indeed the chemical shift dispersion induced by the ligand that allowed for the virtually complete assignment of all NMR spectra, which resulted in the use of a large number of NOE-derived distance constraints to enforce the geometry of the complex. This enabled the determination at high resolution of the solution structure of a 1:1 polyamide:DNA complex comprising one full turn of the DNA helix. The structure presented here offers a close look at a polyamide containing imidazole and b-alanine residues bound to its DNA match site in a 1:1 motif. The complex reveals B-form DNA with a

Facility at Caltech. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was performed at the Protein and Peptide Microanalytical Facility at Caltech. UV ­ visible spectra were obtained on a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer. HPLC analysis was performed on a Beckman Gold system using a Rainin C18 silica, Microsorb MV, 5 mm, 300 mm £ 4.6 mm column. Preparatory reversedphase HPLC was carried out on a Beckman Gold system using a Waters DeltaPak 25 mm £ 100 mm, 100 mm C18 silica column equipped with a guard. FPLC was performed on a Pharmacia LKB system. All buffers were 0.2 mm filtered. Polyamide synthesis Im ­Py ­ b ­Im ­b ­ Im ­Py ­b ­Pam resin was prepared in ten steps from Boc ­b ­ PAM resin as described.48 Internal imidazole residues were incorporated as the Boc ­ b­ Im ­ COOH dimer. The polyamide was cleaved from the solid support by aminolysis of the resin ester linkage using dimethylaminopropylamine (Dp) or 3,30 -diaminoN-methyldipropylamine (Dp-NH2) to provide Im ­ Py ­b ­ Im ­b ­ Im ­ Py ­b-Dp (1) or Im ­Py ­ b ­ Im ­ b­ Im ­ Py ­b ­ Dp ­NH2 (1-NH2), respectively, upon purification by reversed-phase preparatory HPLC in 0.1% (w/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA(aq)) using a 0.33% acetonitrile/minute gradient. A sample of 1-NH2 was treated with an excess of EDTA dianhydride (1:1:1 DMSO/NMP/ DIEA, 55 8C, 15 minutes), and the remaining anhydride was hydrolysed (0.1 M NaOH, 55 8C, 10 min). The EDTA conjugate, Im ­Py ­ b ­Im ­b ­ Im ­ Py ­ b­ Dp ­NH ­ EDTA (1-E), was then purified by reversed-phase preparatory HPLC in 0.1% TFA(aq) with a 0.33% acetonitrile/minute gradient. MALDI-TOF-MS (monoisotopic): (1) 914.5 (914.5 calculated for C41H56N17Oþ); (1-NH2) 957.5 (957.5 8 calculated for C43H61N18Oþ); (1-E) 1231.3 (1231.6 8 calculated for C53H75N20Oþ ). 15 Construction of plasmid DNA The plasmid pAU20 was constructed by inserting the hybridized oligonucleotide, 50 -GATCCGGCCAAAGAGAAGCGGGTTGGCCAAAGAGAAGACGGGTTGGCCAAAGAGAAGAACGGGTTGGCCAAGAGAAGAACGGGGA-30 ·50 -AGCTTCCCCGTTCTTCTCTTGGCCAACCCGTTCTTCTCTTTGGCCAACCCGTCTTCTCTTTGGCCAACCCGCTTCTCTTTGGCCG-30 , into the Bam HI/Hind III polycloning site in pUC19, with subsequent transformation into JM109 subcompetent cells (Promega), according to standard protocols.49 Plasmid DNA was isolated using WizardPlus Midi Preps from Promega. DNA radiolabeling and footprinting methods The 50 and 30 end-labeling of plasmid pAU20 as well as the Affinity Cleavage, DNAse I, and MPE

footprinting experiments were performed exactly in accordance with published protocols.35 The PCR method was chosen for 50 end-labeling, employing two primer oligonucleotides, 32P-50 AATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGG-30 (forward) and 50 -CTGGCACGACAGGTTTCCCG-30 (reverse), to complement the pUC19 Eco RI and Pvu II sites, respectively, such that amplification by PCR generates the 289 bp, 30 -filled Eco RI/Pvu II restriction fragment. NMR sample preparation DNA purification The dimethoxytrityl-protected complementary oligonucleotides 50 -CCAAAGAGAAGCG-30 (purine strand) and 50 -CGCTTCTCTTTGG-30 (pyrimidine strand) were synthesized at the Biopolymer Synthesis Center at Caltech. Each strand was purified separately by reversed phase preparatory HPLC in 100 mM triethylammonium acetate (TEAA), pH 6.5, with a gradient of 1% acetonitrile/minute. The appropriate fractions were combined, lyophilized to dryness, and resuspended in RNAse-free water. The pH was lowered to 5.0 with acetic acid to remove the DMT group, and complete deprotection was observed by analytical HPLC after 12 hours. The deprotected single-stranded oligonucleotides were quantified by measuring their UV absorbance at 260 nm using the calculated extinction coefficients, 1 ¼ 137; 300 M21 cm21 (purine strand) and 1 ¼ 107; 200 M21 cm21 (pyrimidine strand): 7.0 mmol of each strand was combined, and the single strands were hybridized by heating the 4.9 ml sample at 90 8C for ten minutes, with slow cooling to room temperature over six hours. Duplex DNA was separated from a slight excess of singlestranded DNA by FPLC purification using a HiTrap Q strong anion-exchange column (Pharmacia) in 200 mM KCl with a 1% per minute gradient of 1.5 M KCl. The appropriate fractions were combined and concentrated using a Centricon YM-3, 3000 Da cutoff filter from Amicon. The filter was used to dialyze the DNA sample, reducing the KCl concentration to approximately 1 mM. The sample was lyophilized to dryness and then dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), quantifited by measuring UV absorbance, distributed into four 2.83 mmol aliquots, and then lyophilized to dryness. A 4.35 mM NMR sample was prepared by dissolving a 2.83 mmol aliquot of purified duplex DNA in 650 ml of 9:1 H2O/2H2O. The 1:1 polyamide: DNA complex preparation Polyamide concentration was estimated using the molar extinction coefficient, 1 ¼ 31; 000: A polyamide stock solution was prepared by dissolving purified polyamide 1 in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) in 9:1 H2O/2H2O. The polyamide stock was titrated into the 4.35 mM DNA

sample in very small increments in order to determine empirically a 1:1 stoichiometry by observing complete disappearance of free DNA peaks. The final complex concentration was 3.67 mM. For experiments carried out in 2H2O, the complex was lyophilized twice from 2H2O. NMR experiments and data processing NMR experiments were performed at 25 8C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer. The 1D spectra and 2D NOESY spectra in 9:1 H2O/2H2O were acquired using WATERGATE50 water suppression containing a W5 pulse element.51 Presaturation of the residual solvent signal was used in the acquisition of 1D spectra and 2D doublequantum-filter (DQF)-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY for the sample in 2H2O. The TOCSY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 40 and 100 ms, and the NOESY spectra with mixing times of 50, 75, 100, and 150 ms. All the 2D spectra were acquired on the 1:1 polyamide­ DNA complex. Spectral widths were 12,500 Hz for the sample in protiated solvent and 6000 Hz for the sample in dueterated solvent. All spectra were recorded with 512 t1 £ 2048t2 complex points. Data were processed on a SUN Ultra 10 workstation using VNMR (Varian, Inc.) or NMRPipe.52 Resonance assignment was performed using NMRVIEW 4.1.2.53 Chemical shifts were referenced relative to TSP via the residual solvent resonance at 4.7718. Distance constraints In the initial round of structure calculations, resolved and unambiguously assigned cross-peak volumes from the 75 ms 2H2O NOESY spectrum were converted to upper-bound distance constraints using the isolated spin-pair approximation, plus 20% as an error approximation.54 Once the first set of reasonable structures was obtained, a set of representative structures was used as the starting point for two rounds of hybrid relaxation matrix calculations using the MARDIGRAS program.55 NOE cross-peak intensities from the 150 ms 2H2O NOESY spectrum were input to the MARDIGRAS program. The uncertainty in these intensities was accounted for by adjusting the upper bound distances in proportion to their ° magnitude as follows: , 2.0, þ 0.35 A; 2 ­3, ° ° ° ° þ 0.7 A; 3 ­ 4, þ 1.1 A; 4 ­5, þ 1.5 A; . 5.0, þ 1.9 A.32 The constraints were supplemented with additional distance constraints from labile protons identified in the 100 ms NOESY spectrum in protiated solvent. All distance constraints assigned ° from NOEs were given a lower bound of 1.8 A as the sum of van der Waals radii. Overlapped crosspeaks from the 2H2O and H2O NOESY spectra were assigned upper bound distance constraints ° of 5.5 and 6.0 A, respectively, on the basis of calculated distances for the smallest observable crosspeak intensities. Methylene and methyl groups were restrained as Q and M pseudoatoms, respect-

ively, as defined by MARDIGRAS and AMBER 6.0 software.34,45 Watson ­Crick hydrogen bonding constraints were included on the basis of characteristic crosspeaks observed at 12­ 14 ppm between labile protons in the 100 ms H2O NOESY spectrum. Upper and lower bound constraints were assigned for each guanosine imino, thymidine imino, and cytosine amino group in all but the terminal basepairs. N· · ·O or N· · ·N distances,56 as well as H· · ·N and H· · ·O distances were enforced as follows: ° G-O6 to C-N4, 2.81 ­3.01 A; G-N1 to C-N3, 2.85 ­ ° ° 3.05 A; G-N1H to C-N3, 1.80 ­ 2.20 A; G-O6 to ° ° C-N4H1, 1.76 ­2.16 A; A-N1 to T-N3, 2.72­ 2.92 A; °. A-N1 to T-N3H, 1.67­ 2.07 A Structure calculations Calculation strategy was based on previously reported protocols.32,57 Restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) calculations were performed on a Dell Dimension 8100 workstation using the AMBER 6.0 software package.34 All calculations were carried out in vacuo with a distance-depen° dent dielectric and a cut-off distance of 15.0 A for non-bonded interactions. A force constant of 20 kcal mol21 A22 ð1 cal ¼ 4:184 JÞ was applied to interproton distances exceeding the upper and lower constraints, in a smooth parabolic fashion ° for 0.5 A and then linearly. In all, 40 starting DNA structures with variable x-displacement, incline, rise, and twist values were constructed using Nucleic Acids Builder (NAB) software.58 While holding base-pair geometry constant, the DNA backbone was relaxed using 1000 steps of steepest-descent minimization ° (average pairwise all-atom RMSD 3.46 A). The polyamide was constructed using the LEaP module of the AMBER 6.0 software package,34 with partial charges assigned on the basis of an AM1 calculation using the AMPAC module of InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). The polyamide was aligned with the DNA minor ° groove and positioned approximately 12 A from the helix using NAB. Docking was performed using a 15 ps rMD simulated annealing (SA) calculation consisting of 4 ps of linear heating to 600 K, 5 ps of high-temperature dynamics, and 6 ps of linear cooling to 0 K. Further rMD SA calculations did not improve the total energy or RMSD. The family of 40 docked structures had an all-atom ° pairwise RMSD of 1.37 A. The final structures were ranked by increasing residual constraint violation energy, and a calculation was performed using FINDFAM, which indicated that a minimum of 12 structures would be adequate to represent the input data accurately.57 Accordingly, the 12 structures of lowest violation energy were chosen as the final structural ensemble (Figure 6). The core binding site of the final ensemble, which is defined as polyamide residues 1 ­7 (ImPy ­b ­ Im ­ b ­ImPy) and DNA purine tract residues A4 ­ G11 ° and C16 ­T23, has an all-atom RMSD of 0.80 A
