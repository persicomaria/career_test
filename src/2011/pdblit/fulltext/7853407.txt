Methods and Model The molecular dynamics calculations have been carried out using the program GROMOS (10,8). The potential energy function describing the interactions between protein atoms is composed of terms representing covalent bond stretching, bond- angle bending, harmonic (out- of- plane, out- or- tetrahedral configuration) dihedral bending, sinusoidal dihedral torsion, van der Waals' and electrostatic (Coulomb) interactions. No special potentialterm is introduced to represent hydrogen bonds. The parameters ot the energy function are those of Hermans et al. (13), where the C12 repulsive van der Waals' parameters used for 1-4 non-bonded interactions have been updated in order to avoid unphysical cis±trans isomerizations (8). · The MD simulations have been performed at constant temperature, with the system weakly coupled to a thermal bath. Numerical solutions of Newton's eguations and the velocity al~orithm used to couple the system to .tHe thermal bath (14) are equivaSent to solving a Langevin equation, where the stochastic and frictional terms are represented by a global temperature coupling. The energy minimized X-ray structure was used as starting point for the simulations; £or apo-RBP, the retinol molecule removed prior to the minimization. For further details concerning computational procedures and trajectory analysis the reader is referred to Aqvist et al. (ii). Human RBP is composed of 182 amino acid residues (15) and folds a s a single domain 40 A in diameter, with an N-terminal coil) a a-sheet core. an ~-helix and a C-terminal coil. The most striklng feature ot the molecule is an eight-stranded up-and-down A-barrel core (fig.l). These antiparallel strands (A-H) ar 9 wrapped on-the surface of a flattened cone. The loops connecting the strands are all rather short. The barrel, is closed at one end by a salt link between Lys 17 and Asp 79 at the protein surface and by an inner ring of five phenylalanines (residues 15) 20, 45, 77 and 86) around the sidechain of Het 53. The barrel is open to the surroundings at the opposite end. A four-turn~-helix, residues 147-160, packs on the underslde of the lower sheet making sidechain contacts to residues of the strands F, G and H. At the C-terminal end of the helix, Cys 160 forms a disulphide bridge with Cys 4. Residues 161-174 cross the surface of the barrel (strands H, A, B, C and D) to form a disulphide bridge between 70 and 174. The C-terminal residues 176-182 have not been located in the electron density and have, therefore, not been included in the MD calculations.

Jones & Newcomer (4) suggest that this region of the RBP molecule is involved in the binding of prealbumin. Tryptophan labelling

experiments with 2-hydroxy- 5-nitrobenzyl bromide (17) have shown that in the RBP-prealbumin complex three out of four RBP tryptophan

residues are protected, while two residues can be labelled in both apo and holo-RBP. The best candidates for labelling are Trp 67 and

Trp 91, situated in the loops, since both are external in the holo-RBP structure. The only other tryptophans (Trp 24 and Trp 105) are buried

in the interior of the protein, and are unlikely to be labelled. 2. helix displacement. The ~-helix packs on the surface of a G-sheet region making of I~ with the H-strand an angle
