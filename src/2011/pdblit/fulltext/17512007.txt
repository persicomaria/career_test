The biochemical properties of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) truncated with C-terminal 21 amino acids and expressed in insect cells were analyzed. The enzyme carried copyback and de novo RNA synthesis activity but not terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity. k pol and K m for de novo RNA synthesis were calculated as 10.0 pmol/ g/h and 2.5 M under 0.5 mM GTP and 2.0 pmol/ g/h and 3.5 M under 50 M GTP, respectively. Those for copy-back RNA synthesis were similar under both conditions (k pol, 1.8 pmol/ g/h; K m, 3.0 M). De novo RNA synthesis was activated by 0.5 mM GTP. However, the ratio of GTP to three other NTPs was important for activation. Our HCV RdRp showed high activity for the complementary sequence of the HCV internal ribosomal entry site and a synergistic effect of Mg 2 to Mn 2 . © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)

NS5b has the polymerase motif and purified NS5b alone showed an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity in vitro (4, 21). Due to its C-terminal highly hydrophobic sequences, high concentrations of detergents, salts, and glycerol were required to solubilize full-length NS5b. When the hydrophobic 21 amino acids were deleted, NS5b became soluble (10, 35). Recently, its crystal structure was determined (1, 5, 19). In this study, we precisely determined the kinetic character of NS5b for de novo RNA initiation, and found that the complementary sequences of IRES showed high template activity for de novo RNA synthesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recombinant baculoviruses carrying truncated HCV NS5b and its mutants. HCV NS5b truncated by C-terminal 21 amino acids with C-terminal 6 His tag was PCR-amplified using the primer pair of TT101 (5 -TGAGGATCCATATGTCCTACACATGGAGGCGC-3 ) and TK017 (5 -TCCGAATTCTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGGCGGGGTCGGGCACGAGACAG-3 ) from pT702R6X-4 containing the full length HCV 1b genome (DDBJ, EMBL, GenBank Accession No. AY045702). The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into pVL1393 (Invitrogen), resulting in pVLNS5b. MutC, the mutant RdRp carrying GND instead of the GDD motif was constructed by PCR method using the primers TT101, TK017, and TK018 (5 -CTCGTGAACGGAAACGACCTCGTCG-3 ). The mutated fragment was cloned into the pVL1393, resulting in pVLNS5bMutC. MutD, the mutant RdRp carrying R345 substituted by K (32) was constructed by PCR using the primer TT101, TK017, and TK019 (5 -GGAGGCTATGACTAAGTATTCTGCC-3 ), resulting in pVLNS5bMutD. Two micrograms each of pBHNS5b, pVLNS5bMutC, and pVLNS5bMutD was cotransfected with 0.1 g Baculogold (PharMingen) into Sf 21 cells, respectively. RNA templates. Six model RNA templates, XREG, 3NTR, PSTI, DRAI, cIRES, and cIRES-G, were transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase using MEGAscript RNA transcription kit (Ambion) (Figs. 2A and 4A). The DNA fragment containing the 3 -terminus (9240 ­9610) of the HCV genome cDNA was prepared by digestion of pT02R6X-4 with PvuII and XbaI, and cloned into pBluescript SKII, resulting in pBSKHCVTemp1. RNA templates, PSTI and DRAI, were prepared by transcription in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase from PstI- and DraI-digested pBSKHCVTemp1, respectively. DRAI carries an additional UU at its 3 terminus. XREG, 3NTR, cIRES and

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a positive-stranded RNA genome and belongs to the family Flaviviridae (25). HCV is a major causative agent of posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis (2, 9). The HCV RNA genome is about 9.6 kb and has a long open reading frame encoding a polyprotein of approximately 3010 amino acids (3, 30), which is processed into at least 10 polypeptides (NH 2 -C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4a-NS4b-NS5a-NS5bCOOH) by host and viral proteases (12, 24, 33). The 5 untranslated region (UTR) contains the highly conserved internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) of 341 nucleotides (11, 17, 18). The 3 UTR contains a polypyrimidine "U/C" tract, a variable region, and a highly conserved 98-base X region (32). X region and a polypyrimidine "U/C" tract are required for viral infectivity (36) and X region is important for minus strand RNA synthesis (15, 26).

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS cIRES-G were constructed from pT02R6X-4 by PCR with the 5 -T7 promoter-tagged primer and 3 -primers. The primers used for XREG were TK013 (5 -TCAAGCTTGGTGGCTCCATCTTAGCCC-3 ) and TK014 (5 -ACATGATCTGCAGAGAGGCC-3 ), those for 3NTR were TK015 (5 -TCAAGCTTACGGGGAGCTAAACACTCC-3 ) and TK014. cIRES and cIRES-G, which was substituted by G at 3 end of cIRES, were PCR-amplified with the primer pairs, TK020 (5 -AGCTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACTTGACGTCCTGTGGGCGGC-3 ) and TK021 (5 -GCCAGCCCCCGATTGGGGGCGACAC-3 ), and TK020 and TK022 (5 -CCCAGCCCCCGATTGGGGGCGACAC-3 ), respectively. All transcripts were purified by 4% PAGE/6M urea. Expression and purification of HCV RdRp. Spodopetera frugiperda (Sf)-21AE cells were maintained as previously described (14). Sf 21 cells (10 6 cells/ml) were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at 5 MOI. At 4 days of infection, cells were harvested and lysed with 5 packed cell volumes of the extraction buffer (NE buffer) [420 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes/KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl 2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, 1 tablet/25 ml EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, Switzerland)] by homogenization in Dounce homogenizer for 15 strokes with a tight pestle. After gentle extraction at 4°C for 30 min by rotation, cells were centrifuged in a Beckman 45 Ti rotor at 142,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was made in 10% glycerol and 2 mM imidazole, and applied to 2 ml of Ni­NTA­agarose column (Qiagen, Germany). The column was successively washed with 10 bed volumes of TN buffer [500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 2 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF] containing 2 mM, 5 mM and 20 mM imidazole. HCV RdRp was eluted from a Ni­NTA column with TN buffer containing 150 mM imidazole. The fractions containing HCV RdRp were immediately loaded onto Superdex 200 pg column (Pharmacia­Amersham). Purified HCV RdRp was stored at 25°C in 50% glycerol. Analysis of RdRp activity. Where otherwise indicated, RdRp activity was measured in 50 l of the standard transcription buffer, TxG( ) [20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MnCl 2, 50 M ATP, 50 M CTP, and 5 M UTP, 0.5 mM GTP, 0.185 Mbq [ - 32P]UTP, 10 pmol RNA template, 25 g/ml actinomycin D, 5 U human placental RNase inhibitor (Nacalai Tesque, Japan), 1 mM DTT, 3.2 pmol NS5b] or TxG( ) [TxG( ) containing 50 M GTP]. The standard transcription mixture was first pre-incubated with 0.5 mM GTP at 29°C for 30 min, and further incubated for 90 min with addition of the remained ATP, CTP and UTP. The transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% PAGE containing 7 M urea. The amount of transcribed RNA was measured by BAS-2000 image analyzer (Fujifilm, Japan). For determination of the elongation rates with or without 0.5 mM GTP-preincubation, 10 pmol cIRES and 3.2 pmol HCV RdRp were first preincubated with 0.5 mM or 50 M GTP for 30 min, respectively. Then the mixture was further incubated for 90 min in 12 different concentrations (0 ­100 M) of ATP, CTP, and UTP.

gel-filtrated as a single peak of 370 kDa protein from Superdex 200 pg column (purity 98%, Figs. 1A and 1B). 5.0 ­ 8.0 mg of HCV RdRp was purified from 1 liter of Sf21 cell culture. The molecular size of HCV RdRp on SDS­PAGE was estimated at about 64 kDa (Fig. 1C). Similar amounts of MutC and MutD were purified (Fig. 1C). Template Activity of 3 UTR of HCV Genome RNA The activity of RNA templates derived from 3 UTR of HCV genome was compared under the standard condition for de novo RNA synthesis without 0.5 mM GTP preincubation (Fig. 2). Among them, PSTI showed the highest activity. XREG showed very little activity. The products from DRAI and PSTI were sharp (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4), while those from XREG and 3NTR were slightly diffuse (lanes 1 and 2). The size of the products from 3NTR and XREG was about 20 ­25 nt smaller than that of their templates. MutC lost the activity and the activity of MutD was similar to that of wild type (Fig. 1D). Factors Affecting de Novo RNA Synthesis in Vitro To optimize the conditions for de novo RNA synthesis by HCV RdRp, we measured the effects of different divalent cations such as Mg 2 , Mn 2 , Ca 2 , Co 2 , Cu 2 , and Ni 2 using PSTI. The highest activity was obtained between 2 and 3 mM of Mn 2 , while little activity was observed with Mg 2 (Fig. 3A). No activity was detected with 3 mM of Ca 2 , Co 2 , Cu 2 , or Ni 2 (Fig. 3B). Activity was enhanced by the addition of 0.5 or 1 mM of Mg 2 to 2.5 mM Mn 2 (Fig. 3C). Activity decreased, however, when Mg 2 concentrations became higher than 1.5 mM. Activity in KCl was threefold higher than that in NaCl with the peak at 150 mM (Fig. 3D). Higher activity was obtained in monosodium and monopotassium glutamate than in KCl with a shift of the peak to 250 mM. RdRp activity in monosodium glutamate was about 1/3 of that in monopotassium glutamate. When the concentration of K and Na became higher than 250 mM, RdRp activity decreased. The optimal pH of de novo RNA synthesis was 8.0 (Fig. 3E). Without 0.5 mM GTP preincubation, accumulation of the incorporated [ 32P]UMP started at 30 min and continued until more than 90 min (Fig. 3F). For longer incubation, the amount of transcribed RNA was almost the same as that at 90 min (data not shown). Analysis of Initiation of de Novo RNA Synthesis Since Luo et al. reported that preincubation with a high dose of GTP increased the HCV RdRp activity (23), we also examined the effect of preincubation with GTP (Fig. 4). The highest activity of de novo RNA

Structure, size and a part of the sequence of the model RNA templates derived from the 3 -terminal HCV genome are shown in A. Average activity with standard deviations (error bar) relative to that of PSTI was calculated from three independent measurements (B).

synthesis in 50 M NTPs was obtained when cIRES was preincubated with 0.5 mM GTP (Figs. 4B and 4C). The activity of cIRES-G and PSTI was also enhanced by preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP. That of XREG and 3NTR were slightly enhanced by preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP although their activity was very low. The effect of preincubation with NTP other than GTP was also examined using cIRES (Fig. 5A). The reaction was started after preincubation with either 50 [Preincubation ( )] or 500 M [Preincubation ( )] of one of NTPs, followed by addition of 5 or 50 M of the

FIG. 3. Biochemical characterization of de novo RNA synthesis by hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase. The effect of Mn 2 and Mg 2 concentrations (A), 3 mM divalent ions such as Mn 2 , Mg 2 , Ca 2 , Co 2 , Cu 2 , and Ni 2 (B), Mg 2 concentrations under 2.5 mM Mn 2 (C), concentrations of monovalent ions such as KCl, NaCl, Glu-Na, and Glu-K (D), pH (E), and incubation time (F) on de novo RNA synthesis were examined using PSTI in TxG( ) buffer as described under Materials and Methods. Average activity (A­F) and the standard deviations (error bars in B and C) were calculated from three independent measurements.

remained NTPs. No enhancement of the activity by preincubation was observed when it was measured in 5 M NTPs. No apparent difference of RdRp activity was found among any NTP without preincubation. However, various amount of enhancement was observed with the preincubated NTPs when the activity was measured in 50 M NTPs. Preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP showed the highest activity, and the activity with preincubation in 0.5 mM CTP or ATP followed. However, no enhancement was found by preincubation with 0.5 mM UTP. RdRp activity was lower with preincubation in 0.5 mM GTP than without preincubation when it was measured in 0.5 mM NTPs (Fig. 5B). Kinetic Analysis of HCV RdRp K m and k pol values of HCV RdRp for ATP, CTP and UTP were determined from Fig. 4D. For de novo RNA synthesis, k pol and K m were calculated as 10.0 pmol/ g/h and 2.5 M (preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP), and 2.0 pmol/ g/h and 3.5 M (preincubation with 50 M GTP), respectively. For copy-back RNA synthesis, k pol and K m showed no difference between them (k pol, 1.8 pmol/ g/h; K m, 3.0 M).

DISCUSSION We developed a simple preparation method for HCV RdRp of C-terminal 21-amino-acid deletion with 6 His tag (Fig. 1). N-terminal tagged-HCV RdRp lost RdRp activity (data not shown), indicating the importance of N-terminal structure for the folding of the enzyme in eukaryotic cells (1, 5, 19, 21). The purified HCV RdRp had an apparent molecular size of 370 kDa by gel-filtration, indicating that it formed a hexamer not only in crystal form but also in solution like poliovirus RdRp (1, 5, 13, 19, 28). HCV RNA genome contains the conserved 5 - and 3 -UTR with stem­loop structures (8, 11, 17, 18, 34). X-region and the complementary strand of IRES are important for the minus and plus strand synthesis in its genome replication, respectively (30). However, de novo RNA synthesis activity in vitro by RdRp on X region was very low. Initiation of X region in vitro was started at 20 ­25 nt inside from 3 end, because transcripts from X region were diffuse and smaller than the templates (29). When templates had exposed singlestranded 3 -termini, the polymerase activity increased according to the length of the exposed single stranded

FIG. 5. Effect of 0.5 mM NTP preincubation on hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase. The effect of preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP, ATP, CTP, or UTP in the indicated substrate concentrations were measured, respectively (A). The effect of preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP under the various concentrations of the other three NTPs (5, 50, and 500 M) was measured (B). Average with standard deviations (error bar) of the relative RdRp activity was calculated from three independent measurements.

FIG. 4. Kinetic analysis and effect of preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP on hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase.

The radioactivity of the products from de novo (arrowheads) and copy-back RNA synthesis (*) were measured from autoradiogram images of 4% PAGE containing 7 M urea (B).

RNA (Fig. 2). These findings also agreed with the previous ones that transcription of HCV RdRp preferred a single stranded template (16, 26). The poly-U/C tract, which was a binding site for HCV RdRp (4), was required for efficient RdRp activity. Optimal conditions for HCV RdRp were determined using PSTI. The highest activity was obtained in 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM MnCl 2, 1 mM MgCl 2, 250 mM monopotassium glutamate. The synergetic effect of Mg 2 and Mg 2 suggests that Mn 2 is an essential divalent for de novo RNA synthesis and the role of both divalent ions for the reaction may be different at each step such as initiation, transition, or elongation. From structural analysis of bacteriophage 6 RdRp, which is similar to that of HCV RdRp, it is demonstrated that the positions of Mn 2 and Mg 2 at catalytic sites are different and Mn 2 and Mg 2 are required for initiation and elongation, respectively (6). The activity in Tris­HCl was 1.5-fold higher than that in HepesKOH (data not shown). Our results also indicate that the anion affects the RdRp activity and its stability (23). Except for de novo, primer extension and copy-back RNA synthesis, TNTase activities were detected in HCV RdRp in vitro (4, 23), but it is claimed of contam-

ination from eukaryotic cells (20). MutC, in which GDD sequences in polymerase motif C is substituted by GND, completely lost the activity (Figs. 1C and 1D). This result indicates no contamination of TNTase or cellular RdRp activities in our preparation. Lohmann et al. demonstrated that the substitution of arginine 345 by lysine enhanced the RdRp activity by about 50% (22). The activity of RdRp substituted R345 by K (MutD), however, was similar to that of the wild type (Figs. 1C and 1D). This discrepancy may due to the differences of the model RNA templates and NS5b proteins used. Both k pol and K m of de novo RNA synthesis for ATP, CTP and UTP in preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP were larger than those without preincubation. For a copyback RNA synthesis, k pol and K m were the same between de novo and copy-back RNA synthesis. The kinetic analysis indicated that preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP affected only de novo initiation. Enhancement of RdRp activity by 0.5 mM GTP was also observed for the templates that do not have C at 3 (Fig. 4A). Luo et al. found that two kinetic constants for GTP and proposed that the higher K m for initiation and the lower one for elongation (23). Taken together, 0.5 mM GTP may contribute not only to initiation but also to stability of the enzyme, although it had no influence on RNA binding of RdRp (22). However, when HCV RdRp was incubated with 0.5 mM NTPs after preincubation with 0.5 mM GTP, the activity was less than that without preincubation (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that the ratio of initiation GTP to NTPs (1:1 10:1) is important for activation of RdRp. The initiation by 0.5 mM GTP might be canceled and restarted by the addition of 0.5 mM of other NTPs. Biochemical property of HCV RdRp has been determined using model templates. Mg 2 and Mn 2 -dependency varied in each study (10, 21, 23, 31, 35, 37, 38). Complementary sequences of IRES (cIRES) had the highest template activity so far examined (Fig. 4). Biochemical property of HCV RdRp has to be examined again using cIRES template. Structure of promoter or replication origin of HCV genome RNA is not yet identified. In genome replication of Flaviviridae, the amount of the progeny synthesized from the complementary negative stand RNA was significantly larger than that of the negative strand RNA (30). Our HCV RdRp showed the same template selectivity in vitro as in infected cells. Low template activity of X region may be the survival strategy of HCV, or contribution of other factor may be required for efficient initiation from X region. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
