Annexins comprise a multigene family of Ca2 and phospholipidbinding proteins. They consist of a conserved C-terminal or core domain that confers Ca2-dependent phospholipid binding and an N-terminal domain that is variable in sequence and length and responsible for the speci®c properties of each annexin. Crystal structures of various annexin core domains have revealed a high degree of similarity. From these and other studies it is evident that the core domain harbors the calcium-binding sites that interact with the phospholipid headgroups. However, no structure has been reported of an annexin with a complete N-terminal domain. We have now solved the crystal structure of such a full-length annexin, annexin 1. Annexin 1 is active in membrane aggregation and its Ê re®ned 1.8 A structure shows an a-helical N-terminal domain connected to the core domain by a ¯exible linker. It is surprising that the two a-helices present in the N-terminal domain of 41 residues interact intimately with the core domain, with the amphipathic helix 2-12 of the N-terminal domain replacing helix D of repeat III of the core. In turn, helix D is unwound into a ¯ap now partially covering the N-terminal helix. Implications for membrane aggregation will be discussed and a model of aggregation based on the structure will be presented.

Introduction
In 1978, the ®rst annexin (annexin 7 or synexin) was identi®ed and puri®ed from adrenal medulla.1 Due to its ability to make contacts between two or more chromaf®n granules the protein was initially named synexin, from the Greek synexis meaning ``meeting''. More than 100 genes that are homologues of synexin have been found in different organisms since then. They form the annexin family, named after their property to ``annex'' phospholipid membranes. All annexins exhibit calcium-dependent binding to negatively charged phospholipids. Although many research groups have investigated annexin structure and function, their exact biological role still remains unclear. However, the calcium-dependent lipid-binding properties of annexins as well as studies in cell free systems strongly suggests that annexins participate in membrane-related events such as the mediation

of membrane-membrane contacts, the regulation of membrane-cytoskeleton linkages, and ion transport across membranes.2 ± 5 All annexins have a core domain that contains four (in the case of annexin 6 eight) homologous repeats (numbered I to IV) of ®ve a-helices each. These repeats are arranged into a slightly curved disc with the calcium-binding sites on the convex side. In the case of annexin 5 it has been shown that binding to negatively charged phospholipid headgroup analogs is mediated by a so-called ``calcium bridge'',6 where the calcium ions are coordinated by backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms and side-chain carboxylates of the protein, and by the phosphoryl oxygens of the phosphoglycerol backbone of the lipid. In addition to the core domain, many annexins also contain an N-terminal domain that has been shown to confer many of the speci®c properties of each annexin. These N-terminal domains are different in sequence and length, varying from a short tail of 11 to 19 residues (annexins 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13), to 33 to 42 residues (annexins 2 and 1, respectively), to more than 100 residues (annexins 7 and 11). They harbor binding sites for S100 proteins (annexin 1: S100A11, annex# 2001 Academic Press

490 in 2: S100A10, annexin 11: S100A6) and various phosphorylation sites (e.g. annexin 1 and 2) for serine/threonine and tyrosine-speci®c kinases. The three-dimensional structures of annexins solved so far have only revealed that the N-terminal of the core domain is located on its concave side, opposite from the Ca2-binding sites. However, no annexin structure published so far contains a complete N-terminal domain. Annexin 1 has been shown to aggregate neutrophil and chromaf®n cell granules and arti®cial membrane vesicles in the presence of Ca2.7 ± 11 Biochemical studies on the annexin 1-phospholipid interaction have shown that the N-terminal domain is important for the aggregation of vesicles but not for the binding of annexin 1 to negatively charged phospholipids.10,12 Moreover, a chimera comprising the core of annexin 5 (which by itself does not promote aggregation) and the N-terminal domain of annexin 1 (IN-VC) is capable of membrane aggregation.13 Andree and coworkers also described a secondary lipid-binding site in the chimera IN-VC. They measured the adherence of 20 % Phosphatidylserine (PS)/80 % Phosphatidylcholine (PC) or pure PC vesicles to planar lipid bilayers coated with IN-VC. It is unexpected that the vesicles composed of pure PC showed the same adherence as the PS/PC vesicles, indicating that the annexin chimera, once bound to the lipid membrane, exposed a second lipid-binding site. This lipidbinding site is distinct from the Ca2-dependent ones in the core domains of annexins because it is not speci®c for negatively charged phospholipids. Resonance energy transfer measurements with annexin 1 con®rmed the existence of the second membrane-binding site.14 Experiments using controlled proteolysis with trypsin suggested that annexin 1 undergoes a conformational change upon Ca2-dependent binding to lipid bilayers and that the secondary binding site is only exposed after Ca2-dependent binding.14

Structure of Full-length Annexin 1

We are interested in the mechanism of membrane aggregation and fusion by annexins. As described above, numerous reports suggest that in addition to the protein core, the N-terminal domain of annexin 1 is involved in important aspects of membrane binding. However, the threedimensional structure of annexin 1 published in 1993 does not contain information on the structure and possible interactions of the N-terminal domain because the ®rst 32 amino acid residues of the protein are missing due to proteolysis (PDB-code 1AIN).15 The structure of an annexin 1 N-terminal peptide comprising residues 2 to 12 of annexin 1 in complex with the S100A11 protein was published recently (PDB-code 1QLS).16 This 11-residue annexin 1 peptide exhibits an a-helical conformation, but it is not known how the complete N-terminal domain folds, or how it interacts with the core domain. Therefore, we have crystallized full-length annexin 1 comprising the core domain and the N-terminal domain to investigate a possible structural and functional role of the N-terminal domain in lipid interactions.

Results
The overall structure The overall structure of the full-length annexin 1 monomer comprising the protein core (repeats I-IV) and the N-terminal domain is shown in Figure 1(a). For comparison the previously determined structure of human annexin 1 lacking the ®rst 32 amino acid residues is shown in Figure 1(b) (Á1-32 anx1, PDB-code 1AIN).15 It is important to note that the full-length annexin 1 structure described here was obtained from crystals grown in the absence of calcium ions. Extensive attempts to obtain crystals in the presence of calcium have not been successful so far. A possible explanation

of this observation will be presented in Discussion, see below. In addition to the newly determined N-terminal domain, a comparison of the two annexin 1 core domain structures reveals striking differences in repeat III. The large-scale conformational change in this repeat is due to the insertion of an amphipathic a-helix of the N-terminal domain into repeat III of the core domain, thus replacing the former short D helix in repeat III of the core which now unwinds to form a ¯ap over the inserted N-terminal helix. The type II calcium binding site in repeat III is destroyed by this insertion because the ``cap'' residue (Glu255) 39 residues downstream of the calcium-coordinating backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of the AB loop,15,17 which is located at the C-terminal end of the D helix, is no longer in the proper position for calcium coordination. In contrast, repeats I, II and IV in the two structures are very similar. The loop regions of the fulllength structure are slightly longer and less ordered in comparison to Á1-32 annexin 1. In particular, the AB loop in repeat II shows a different conformation that will be discussed later. Table 1 lists the secondary structure elements of the fulllength protein. No electron density could be detected for residues 1, 345 and 346. Mass spectra of dissolved full-length annexin 1 crystals suggest that, although expressed in bacteria, the majority of the annexin 1 population contains no Met1.18 The C-terminal residues 345 and 346 are highly disordered. As described in the Á1-32 annexin 1 structure, we detect continuous electron density between the side-chains of Cys324 and Cys343, demonstrating the existence of an intramolecular disul®de bridge. The N-terminal domain The N-terminal domain of annexin 1 contains 41 residues. In the Á1-32 annexin 1 structure residues 33 to 41 form an unstructured coil that runs along the concave side of the molecule (see Figure 1(b)).15 Weng and coworkers described these residues as a connecting strand with the ®rst residue (residue 33) non-covalently interacting with core repeat IV.15 In contrast, the presence of the complete N-terminal domain results in signi®cant secondary and tertiary structural changes that can be summarized as follows: We now describe the N-terminal domain of the structure presented herein by tracing backwards from the N terminus of the previously reported truncated structure (residue 33) in the direction of residue 2 rather than the forward direction. Residues 33 to 27 can be viewed as an extension of the unstructured strand running toward repeat IV and further on to repeat III (see Figure 1(a)). The remaining N-terminal residues cause dramatic structural changes in core repeat III. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the three-

dimensional structure of repeat III plus the N-terminal domain of full-length annexin 1 with that of repeat III of N-terminally truncated annexin 1. The ®rst 26 amino acid residues of the N-terminal domain form two a-helices as suggested by secondary structure predictions using the program SOPMA.19 These two a-helices are tilted with respect to each other by a kink of 60  at Glu17. The a-helix formed by residues 26 to 18 interacts with the surface of repeat IV of the core domain. Then, as a result of the kink at position 17, the direction of the chain changes and the a-helix formed by residues 2 to 16 points towards the convex face of the molecule. It is surprising that this N-terminal a-helix now occupies in part the position of helix D of repeat III of Á1-32 annexin 1. The residues that formed the D helix in the Á1-32 annexin 1 structure (residues 242 to 257) now form a ¯ap over the inserted N-terminal helix. Examination of the electron density for residues 2 to 8 (Figure 3) reveals favorable packing of hydrophobic residues of the N-terminal domain (Met3, Val4, Phe7) into a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Phe221, Leu225, Phe237 and Val268 of core repeat III. The surface area of the N-terminal domain that is in contact with repeat III of the core domain (helix NA, residues 2 to Ê 17) is 457 A2. Helix NB of the N-terminal domain (residues 18 to 26) and the linker region (residues 27 to 41) are in contact with repeats I and IV of the core domain with a buried surface Ê area of 810 A2. Therefore, the total buried surface area for the interaction between the N-terminal domain and the core domain is Ê 1267 A2.

Annexin 1 contains a single tryptophan residue in the N-terminal domain. The structure reveals that Trp12 is solvent accessible, e.g. the nitrogen atom of the indole ring is hydrogen-bonded to a surface water molecule. Tryptophan ¯uorescence spectra of annexin 1 in solution showed a maximum of the emission around 345 nm.20,21 This wavelength is similar to the maximum of the free amino acid in aqueous solution, suggesting that the residue is solvent-accessible, as con®rmed by the three-dimensional structure in the absence of calcium.

In the past, annexin 1 has been shown to be phosphorylated at Tyr21 by the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor kinase in vitro.22 ± 24 Tyr21 is in the second a-helix in the N-terminal domain, but in contrast to Trp12 discussed above, Tyr21 is buried. Its side-chain is located in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side-chains of residues Phe13, Met276, Ile289, and Leu318, leading to the hypothesis that under these conditions (absence of calcium) no phosphorylation of Tyr21 is likely to occur.

Dimer contacts and the type II calcium-binding site in repeat II Full-length porcine annexin 1 crystallizes as a non-crystallographic dimer as shown in Figure 4. In contrast to the annexin 12 hexamer that can also be interpreted as a trimer of dimers the annexin 1 dimer does not show complete face-to-face orientation.25,26 The two molecules are tilted against each other by almost 90  , and contacts between them are only found in repeats II, III and IV. Surprisingly, in the absence of Ca2 the e-amino group of Lys250 in one monomer mimics a calcium ion by coordinating the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms that were involved in the coordination of the calcium ion in the AB loop of repeat II of the other monomer in the Á1-32 annexin 1 structure. A similar interaction between two monomers via a lysine e-amino group in an unoccupied calcium binding site was also observed in the annexin 12 wild-type structure25 and in a different form in the annexin 12 E105K mutant structure.26 In the annexin 12 wild-type structure the type II Ca2-binding site of repeat II contains no calcium ion but instead is occupied by the e-amino group of Lys68 of the opposing trimer.25 The annexin 12 E105K structure revealed a similar phenomenon: instead of disrupting the intermolecular calcium-binding site by changing the conserved Glu105 to a lysine residue, as anticipated, the e-amino group of Lys105 now replaces the calcium ion in the binding site. Hexamer formation is still observed.26 A comparison of the coordination of the e-amino group of Lys250 in the full-length structure and the coordination of the calcium in the Á1-32 struc-

The extended loops of what are the D helices of repeat III in the calcium-bound form are presented in cyan and orange, respectively.

ture (Figure 5(a) and (b)) reveals signi®cant differences. The calcium ion is coordinated by the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues Met127, Gly129, and Gly131 and by OD1 and OD2 of Asp171. In contrast, the e-amino group of Lys250 of one molecule of the full-length structure is coordinated by the backbone carbonyl oxygens of residues Lys128, Gly129 and Gly131 from the opposite face of the AB loop of second molecule when compared to the calcium interaction. Figure 5 also illustrates that the AB loop is longer in the structure of full-length annexin 1 than in Á1-32 annexin 1, and that the D helix moves away from the AB loop in the absence of Ca2 coordination of the acidic capping residue Asp171. A second dimer contact could be identi®ed between a pair of His283 side-chains, one from each of the monomers. The two histidine sidechains are hydrogen-bonded via their respective Ê NE2 atoms (distance 2.73 A). This arrangement implies that one proton is shared between the two monomers in the asymmetric unit, with one His283 being protonated (donor) and the other His283 being deprotonated (acceptor). At present it is not known whether the crystallographic dimer represents a physiological dimer.

Discussion
Annexin 1 has been described as a protein with membrane aggregating properties. While the calcium-dependent phospholipid binding of annexins

494 including annexin 1 is mediated via the convex side of the core domain, a secondary lipid-binding site with a different speci®city has been described for annexin 1.7,11 ± 13 This second binding site is exposed (or accessible) only upon membrane binding14 and in contrast to the archetypal annexin-phospholipid interaction appears to be less headgroup-speci®c, i.e. binding to 100 % PC vesicles has been reported.11,13 These experimental results led to the speculation that the N-terminal domain of annexin 1 is involved in this new lipid binding mechanism.14,21,27 Numerous studies of lipid binding, membranes aggregation and the dependence of these properties on phosphorylation and removal of the N-terminal domain of annexin 1 have been reported and their results can be explained with the following model which is based on the structure described in the paragraph below (see Figure 6(a)). (i) The structure of full-length annexin 1 in the absence of calcium determined herein represents the inactive form of the protein. In Figure 6(a) it is represented as the molecule with its N-terminal domain buried inside to the protein core. Upon calcium-mediated membrane binding, the previously unfolded D-¯ap in core repeat III folds into the proper helical conformation for calcium binding, forming a type II Ca2 site. In the process, the N-terminal domain is ejected from the hydrophobic pocket formed by repeat III and ends up solvent-accessible on the concave side of the molecule. In this proposed activated conformation, the two a-helices of the N-terminal domain would be free to move around via the ¯exible linker formed by residues 27 to 41. Such an exposed N-terminal domain and in particular the amphipathic portion of the ®rst a-helix (residues 2 to 12) might be responsible for the fact that despite intense efforts no crystals of full-length annexin 1 have been obtained in the presence of calcium. It can be presumed that the proposed solvent-exposed N-terminal domain interferes with the formation of crystal contacts. (ii) After this calcium-triggered switch in conformation the previously buried N-terminal domain would be free to interact with new partners. These could include the S100A11 protein known to bind to the N-terminal domain of annexin 128,29 (Figure 6(a), scheme C) or a second annexin 1 molecule bound through homophilic N-terminal interactions (Figure 6(a), scheme B). However, it is tempting to speculate that each Ca2/membrane-activated annexin 1 molecule could now bind to a second membrane via its exposed N-terminal domain (Figure 6(a), scheme A). Helical wheel analysis shows that the ®rst 11 amino acids of the N-terminal domain form an amphipathic helix (residues 2 to 12, Figure 6(b)).28 Since this calcium-independent interaction would be governed largely by the hydrophobic effect, less speci®city would be expected, explaining the lack of headgroup speci®city for the second lipid-binding site in annexin 1.

Structure of Full-length Annexin 1

Figure 6. (a) Model of the annexin 1-membrane interaction leading to aggregation: The inactive form of the protein, in the absence of calcium, is represented as the molecule with the N-terminal domain (yellow) buried in the core domain. Upon calcium and membrane binding, the loop of repeat III folds into the D-helix, resulting in proper type II conformation for calcium binding. As a result, the N-terminal domain has to vacate the hydrophobic pocket of repeat III of the core domain. Now, the N-terminal domain is solvent exposed, allowing its amphipathic a-helix (residues 2 to 12) to interact with speci®c partners to cause membrane aggregation: (A) Interaction of the N-terminal helix with a second bilayer. (B) Dimerization of two such annexins via their N-terminal helices. (C) Linking of the concave faces of two such annexin molecules via an S100A11 dimer (blue) which is known to contain two interaction regions for the amphipathic N-terminal helix. (b) Amphipathic helix NA. View from the N terminus down the helix axis of residues 2 to 12 shows that the bottom face is lined with hydrophobic side-chains (Met3, Val4, Phe7, Leu8, Trp12) (yellow) while the top face is lined with hydrophilic residues (Glu6, Lys9) (blue).

This latter hypothesis provides a structural explanation of the many studies that describe the activation of a second, distinct phospholipid binding site upon calcium-dependent membrane

binding. The model proposes a topology by which a single annexin molecule could simultaneously interact with two membrane bilayers, therefore, providing a mechanism for membrane aggregation (Figure 6(a), scheme A). However, this model appears to be in con¯ict with a cryo-electron microscopy study describing annexin-induced junctions between Dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG)/Dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) liposomes.30 In the case of Ca2-induced annexin bilayer junctions the distances between the centersof-mass of the outer bilayer lea¯ets were shown to Ê Ê be 81 A and 80 A, for annexin 2 and annexin 1 respectively (six-stripe junctions, Figures 6(c) and 7(c) of the work by Lambert et al.),30 which after accounting for the width of the lipid headgroups Ê corresponds to a protein thickness of 60 A (see 30 Lambert et al., p. 47). Furthermore, the thinner ®ve-stripe junctions (junctions 4 in Figures 6(b) and 7(b) of the work by Lambert et al.)30 showed even reduced thickness of the protein layer. Even though the density pro®le of the six-striped junctions might be interpreted as a double layer of annexin 1 between the two lipid bilayers, based on crystals structures such an annexin double layer Ê would be at least 70 A in thickness (not accounting Ê for the N-terminal domain)25 and about 90 A in the case of full-length annexin 1 with a thickness of Ê 45 A per monomer. In light of the novel N-terminal domain structure presented herein we would like to propose an alternate interpretation of these thin section images: the two central stripes of the six-stripe sections would be due to annexin molecules randomly attached to one or the other bilayer via their calcium-binding convex faces, and consequently with their exposed N-terminal domains interacting with the opposing bilayer, resulting in an average appearance of two layers. The thinner ®ve-stripe sections observed for both annexin 1 and annexin 2 (junctions 4 in Figures 6(b) and 7(b) of the work by Lambert et al.)30 could then be interpreted as junctions where the majority of the convex faces of annexin are attached to one of the bilayers, resulting in a single, probably slightly asymmetric high-density feature between the phospholipid bilayers. The importance of the N-terminal domain of annexin 1 has not only been described in biochemical studies but also in a biological system. Haigler and coworkers found two isoforms of annexin 1 in pigeon (Columba livia): a 35 kDa variant that is prolactin-induced, and a prolactin-independent 37 kDa protein.31 These are encoded by separate genes and differ mostly in the hinge region between the N-terminal and the core domain (residues 21 to 39). The 37 kDa protein contains phosphorylation sites like mammalian annexin 1, whereas the prolactin-induced 35-kDa isoform does not. These observations suggest that the two isoforms of pigeon annexin 1 are activated by different mechanisms and therefore might be responsible for different biological functions.31

Figure 7. The B-factor distribution of the Ca-atoms of annexin 1. The black broken curve represents monomer 1 and the gray continuous curve monomer 2. High Bfactors were found in the loop regions, especially for the strand connecting the N-terminal domain and repeat I and the loops in repeat III. Monomer 1 exhibits overall lower B-factors resulting from more highly ordered connectors between the N-terminal and core domain, and between repeats II and III.

Further experiments will be carried out to test the validity of our model of annexin 1-mediated membrane aggregation and the role of the N-terminal domain in general.

Materials and Methods
Protein and crystals Recombinant porcine annexin 1 comprising the protein core and the N-terminal domain was puri®ed according to the work by Rosengarth et al.32 The integrity of the protein was con®rmed by MALDI mass spectrometry.18 Crystals were grown using the vapor diffusion technique at 4  C. The well solution (500 ml) contained 2.2 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M Tris HCl (pH 8.5). On the coverslip 3 ml of the well solution were mixed with 3 ml of the protein solution at a concentration of 28 mg mlÀ1.18 Crystals (®nal size: 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 1 mm) appeared after three days. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking annexin 1 crystals in the respective heavy atom solution for different time periods at increasing concentrations at 4  C. Heavy atom salts used were mercuric acetate (HgAc2, derivative HG), methyl mercuric acetate (CH3HgAc, derivative HG2) and potassium tetrachloroplatinate (II) (K2[PtCl4], derivative PT). For data collection, crystals were transferred to a solution containing the mother liquor and 20 % (v/v) glycerol as a cryo protectant. The crystals were ¯ashcooled in liquid nitrogen. Data collection and processing X-ray diffraction data of native annexin 1 were collected at beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light

496
Source (ALS) in Berkeley, CA, and for the heavy atom derivatives at beamline 9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), CA, USA. The wavelength Ê of the synchrotron radiation was 1.0 A and CCD area detectors (2 Â 2 array from Area Detector Systems Corporation, San Diego) were used at both beamlines. We collected 135 images from one native crystal, 117 images for the HG derivative, 2 Â 135 images (inverse beam) for the HG2 derivative and 2 Â 135 images (inverse beam) for the PT derivative at 100 K. The Áf was 1  for all crystals. Data analysis was carried out using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK.33 Structure solution Porcine annexin 1 crystallizes in the spacegroup Ê Ê P212121 with unit cell parameters a  63.6 A, b  96.3 A, Ê c  127.4 A and a  b  g  90  .18 It is important to note that the crystals were grown in the absence of calcium. So far, no crystals of full-length annexin 1 have been obtained in the presence of calcium. The volume of the unit cell suggested two annexin 1 molecules per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved using a combination of molecular replacement (MR) and multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR). Patterson cross-rotation and translation searches (Molecular Replacement, program XPLOR)34 were carried out using the coordinates of Nterminally-truncated annexin 1 (PDB code 1AIN),15 with the amino acid residues changed from the human to the porcine sequence. The cross-rotation search yielded two solutions (3.38 and 2.90 with the highest noise peak at 1.85) related by a local 2-fold axis that runs parallel to the 2-fold crystallographic y axis. This explains why no local two-folds could be identi®ed with Patterson selfrotation searches. Translation searches with the two properly oriented molecules yielded unambiguous solutions. The initial crystallographic R-factor was 42.6 % Ê for data between 3.5 and 10 A. After rigid body (12 parameters) and positional re®nement (150 minimization Ê steps) using data with F/s(F) > 3 between 12 and 2.5 A the R-factor decreased to 35.8 %. Over 20 rounds of re®nement and modeling using the program O version 6.2.135 were carried out in an effort to build the N-term-

Structure of Full-length Annexin 1 inal domain and rebuild other parts of the molecules. Model building was done using 3Fo À 2Fc and Fo À Fc maps. After further re®nement cycles and increasing the Ê resolution to 1.8 A the R-factor did not decrease past 32.7 % and there was still no continuous density for the N-terminal domain for either monomer. At this point we resorted to the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method in order to obtain improved phases free of model bias. Heavy atom sites were located by calculation the difference Fourier maps using phases calculated from the molecular replacement model. Heavy atom re®nement and phase calculations were done using the program MLPHARE of the CCP4 package.36 Three different heavy atom derivatives yielded a ®nal ®gure of merit of 0.47. Modi®ed experimental electron density maps (2Fo À Fc), initially computed with the program DM of the CCP4 package37 using solvent ¯attening, non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging and histogram matching were generally of excellent quality. We were able to trace the complete protein core, including the region of helix D in repeat III (now in extended conformation), but parts of the N-terminal domain were still not de®ned because the process of solvent ¯attening and NCS averaging had masked out the weaker density for the N-terminal domain. The R-value after two re®nement Ê cycles using all data between 12 and 2.5 A was 33.1 %. The diffraction and MIR phasing statistics are summarized in Table 2. We then used a combination of SHARP38 and SOLOMON39 to generate another set of experimental maps. Especially SOLOMON improved map quality signi®cantly, but the connector between the N-terminal domain and the core domain (residues 28 to 39) was still not traceable. By calculating a composite annealed omit map (2Fo À Fc) using the program CNS version 1.0 40 by stepwise omitting 7.5 % of the molecule, we were ®nally able to model the complete N-terminal domain of one monomer and parts of the N terminus of the second monomer. It is important to note that we did not use NCS restraints at this point of the re®nement process anymore because it was evident that the two monomers exhibited different conformations in that region.

gram CNS resulted in an Rfree of 25.9 % and an R-value of 22.3 % after ten cycles. We increased the resolution Ê range from 40 to 1.8 A and all structure factors were used (no sigma cutoff). Besides the two annexin 1 monomers per asymmetric unit we were able to locate 739 water molecules and 12 sulfate ions. The program PROCHECK reports that 93.2 % of the residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, 6.5 % in additional allowed regions and 0.3 % in disallowed regions.41 This 0.3 % re¯ects the Val60 residue in the AB loop of repeat I in each monomer that, according to the well-de®ned electron density in this region, are in an unusual conformation. The N-terminally truncated annexin 1 and 2 structures reveal the same conformation for the corresponding Val residue in the AB loop of repeat 1. In the case of annexin 2, it was described as a left-handed a-helix allowing the coordination of the calcium ion in this particular Ca2-binding site.15,42 The overall dimensions of one full-length annexin 1 Ê monomer are as follows: width 40 A, length (convex Ê Ê site) 70 A and height 45 A. Data collection, reduction and phasing statistics are given in Table 2 and the re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 3. The B-factor distribution of the Ca atoms of the two monomers is shown in Figure 7.
