Structure of an mRNA Capping Enzyme Bound to the Phosphorylated Carboxy-Terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II
Carme Fabrega,1 Vincent Shen,1 Stewart Shuman,2 and Christopher D. Lima1,* 1 Biochemistry Department Structural Biology Program Weill Medical College of Cornell University New York, New York 10021 2 Molecular Biology Program Sloan-Kettering Institute New York, New York 10021 methylated by RNA (guanine-7) methyltransferase (Shuman, 2001). Specific targeting of cap formation to pol II transcripts is achieved through physical interactions of the guanylyltransferase component of the capping apparatus with phosphorylated CTD. Ser5 CTD phosphorylation appears to play critical roles in recruitment and regulation of capping activity in both mammalian and fungal organisms. Mammalian RNA guanylyltransferase binds in vitro to CTD phosphorylated at either Ser2 or Ser5, but its activity is stimulated only if the CTD is phosphorylated at Ser5 (Ho and Shuman, 1999; Wen and Shatkin, 1999). S. cerevisiae CTD Ser5-Ala mutations are synthetically lethal with mutations in the yeast guanylyltransferase Ceg1, suggesting that Ser5 is required for proper CTD interaction with the capping apparatus in vivo (Rodriguez et al., 2000). Whereas CTD Ser2 and Ser5 are both essential for cell viability, suppressor analysis suggests that the two serines perform distinct functions in vivo (West and Corden, 1995; Yuryev and Corden, 1996). The in vivo phenotypes of Ser2 and Ser5 mutations with respect to cotranscriptional processing have not been determined. Cellular and viral guanylyltransferases employ a twostep ping-pong reaction mechanism involving a covalent enzyme-(lysyl-N)-GMP intermediate. They comprise a branch of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily, which includes ATP-dependent and NAD dependent DNA ligases. Crystal structures of four family members highlight a common tertiary structure consisting of an N-terminal nucleotidyl transferase domain (NT) and a C-terminal OB-fold domain (OB) (Subramanya ° et al., 1996; Hakansson et al., 1997; Lee et al., 2000; Odell et al., 2000). Within the NT domain is an NMP binding pocket composed of five motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, and V) that define the polynucleotide ligase/mRNA capping enzyme superfamily (Shuman, 2001). Motif I (KxDG) contains the lysine nucleophile to which GMP becomes covalently linked in the first step of the capping reaction. Chlorella virus guanylyltransferase structures bound to GTP, lysyl-GMP, and GpppG underscored important conformational changes between the OB and NT domains during substrate binding and reaction chemistry ° ° (Hakansson et al., 1997; Hakansson and Wigley, 1998). Little is known about the fine structure of the phosphorylated CTD and how it achieves its various effector functions. Despite its relatively homogeneous primary structure, the CTD is able to interact with many partners that display no obvious structural relatedness (reviewed by Carty and Greenleaf, 2002). An appealing hypothesis is that the CTD is structurally disordered in aqueous solution and thereby plastic in the unbound state, but takes on defined structures that are templated by its particular binding partner. The interaction of the capping apparatus with the phosphorylated CTD provides an attractive model system to address this issue. Reported ° here is the 2.7 A crystal structure of Candida albicans RNA guanylyltransferase bound to a 17 amino acid segment of a CTD phosphopeptide composed of four Ser5-PO4 heptad repeats. The structure illuminates two extensive CTD binding sites that are localized to the

Summary ° The 2.7 A structure of Candida albicans RNA guanylyltransferase Cgt1 cocrystallized with a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) peptide composed of four Ser5-PO4 YSPTSPS heptad repeats illuminates distinct CTDdocking sites localized to the Cgt1 N-terminal nucleotidyl transferase domain. Tyr1, Pro3, Pro6, and Ser5PO4 side chains from each of two YSPTSPS repeats contribute to the interface. Comparison to the Pin1CTD structure shows that the CTD can assume markedly different conformations that are templated by particular binding partners. Structural plasticity combined with remodeling of CTD primary structure by kinases and phosphatases provides a versatile mechanism by which the CTD can recruit structurally dissimilar proteins during transcription. A binding site for the RNA triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus was also uncovered within the Cgt1 OB domain. Introduction The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) serves as a scaffold for macromolecular assemblies that regulate mRNA synthesis and processing (Hirose and Manley, 2000; Bentley, 2002). The CTD is unique to pol II and is composed of a tandemly repeated heptad motif with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS. The mammalian pol II large subunit has 52 heptad repeats, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe subunit has 29 repeats, and the subunits of budding yeasts Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have 25­27 repeats. The CTD undergoes extensive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser5 and Ser2 in coordination with the transcription cycle. The mRNA capping apparatus is the first processing assembly to act on nascent pre-mRNA (Jove and Manley, 1982; Rasmussen and Lis, 1993; Chiu et al., 2002), and its binding to the elongation complex via the CTD is clearly dependent on CTD phosphorylation (Cho et al., 1997; McCracken et al., 1997; Yue et al., 1997). mRNA capping occurs by a series of three enzymatic reactions in which the 5 triphosphate terminus of pre-mRNA is cleaved to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase, capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase, and

N-terminal nucleotidyl transferase domain of the capping enzyme and a separate binding site for the RNA triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus localized within the C-terminal OB domain. Results and Discussion Overview of the C. albicans GuanylyltransferaseCTD Complex The C. albicans RNA guanylyltransferase derivative Cgt1(1-395) is catalytically active in vitro and suffices for complementation of a S. cerevisiae guanylyltransferase null mutation (ceg1 ) in vivo (Schwer et al., 2001). Cgt1(1-395) was cocrystallized with a 28 aa synthetic CTD phosphopeptide composed of four tandem Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 repeats wherein every Ser5 was phosphorylated. Crystals contained two Cgt1 monomers (A and B) in the asymmetric unit. The two monomers exhib° ited differences and were refined independently at 2.7 A to an Rcryst and Rfree of 0.201 and 0.267, respectively (Table 1). The model of monomer A included amino acid residues 1­390 with Lys67 covalently linked to GMP, thus capturing the intermediate in the two-step nucleotidyl transfer reaction. The model of monomer B contained residues 1­263 and 274­389; the intervening segment was disordered. Electron density around monomer B Lys67 was modeled as GTP with partial occupancy. The

nucleotide-bound forms of Cgt1 were generated during their production in E. coli as no GTP was added during purification or crystallization. Cgt1 consists of two structural domains characteristic of the ligase/capping enzyme superfamily: an N-terminal nucleotidyl transferase domain (NT) and a C-terminal OB-fold domain (OB) (Figure 1). A cross-domain contact was observed in both monomers between the N-terminal 6 aa segment and the OB domain. Structure of the Phosphorylated CTD and the Role of CTD Primary Structure in Binding to Capping Enzyme In discussing the CTD structure and its interactions with the capping enzyme, individual amino acids within the CTD 28-mer peptide will be referred to by specifying their numerical position within the heptad (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7), while each of the four heptad segments within the 28-mer peptide will be denoted by Y1xS2xP3xT4xS5xP6xS7x, where x is either a, b, c, or d. Monomer B was bound to a 17 aa segment T4aS5aphosP6aS7aY1bS2bP3bT4bS5bphosP6bS7bY1cS2cP3cT4cS5cphosP6c (Figure 1B), whereas monomer A was bound to a 9 aa segment T4aS5aphosP6aS7aY1bS2bP3bT4bS5bphos (Figure 1A). Electron density consistent with eight remaining CTD residues (P6bS7bY1cS2cP3cT4cS5cphosP6c) bound to monomer A could be observed but was deemed inadequate for atomic modeling. Because most of the guanylyltransfer-

ase-CTD interactions are similar for the two Cgt1 monomers (with some differences as noted), our discussion will focus on the larger (17 aa) CTD interface with capping enzyme monomer B. Cgt1-CTD interactions occur exclusively within the NT domain of Cgt1 (Figures 1 and 2). The CTD exhibits a mostly extended -like conformation that includes a single turn (Figure 2A). The CTD peptide spans the distance from one side of the NT domain to the other while binding within a saddle-shaped cleft on the NT domain surface (Figure 2B). The S5aphos phosphate is positioned within a positively charged pocket. The CTD peptide proceeds through the cleft utilizing van der Waals (VDW) contacts between Cgt1 and CTD residues P6aS7aY1b. The CTD turns near S5bphos before making VDW contacts between Y1c and the Cgt1 surface. Before emerging from the cleft, Cgt1 anchors phosphoserine S5cphos into another positively charged pocket. A turn near CTD S5bphos brings two adjacent CTD heptad repeats together so ° that Y1b and Y1c are within 5.5 A of each other. In sum, the CTD binding surface includes two electrostatic anchors at either end (to S5aphos and S5cphos), between which lies a mostly hydrophobic and complementary surface (Figure 2C). Four CTD heptad side chains contribute substantially to the interface with the capping enzyme: Tyr1, Pro3, Pro6, and Ser5-PO4. In contrast, the Ser2, Thr4, and Ser7 side chains are oriented away from the binding surface (Figures 2 and 3). CTD binding and allosteric activation of the mammalian guanylyltransferase Mce1 was studied by introducing alanine substitutions for Tyr1, Pro3, Thr4, or Pro6 of each heptad of the 28-mer synthetic CTD Ser5-PO4 peptide, or by eliminating each of the phosphates at Ser5 (Pei et al., 2001a). Removal of the Ser5 phosphate and Y1A mutation abolished Mce1 binding and activation, whereas P3A and P6A mutations reduced the CTD affinity by 8- to 10-fold. T4A mutation had no effect on Mce1 binding or activation. A similar

stringent requirement for Tyr1 and Ser5 phosphorylation was observed for CTD interaction with S. pombe guanylyltransferase (Pei et al., 2001a). Thus, the requirements for individual CTD side chains for capping enzyme binding in vitro are thoroughly consistent with the CTD side-chain contacts (or lack thereof) observed in the Cgt1-CTD structure. The structural contacts are also consistent with genetic evidence which showed that uniform CTD mutations in Tyr1 and Ser5 are lethal in S. cerevisiae, whereas mutation of Thr4 is benign (West and Corden, 1995; Stiller et al., 2000). Guanylyltransferase Components of the Capping Enzyme-CTD Interface Interactions between Cgt1 and the phosphorylated CTD are mediated by distinct CTD-docking sites (CDS) on the guanylyltransferase surface, which we name CDS1, CDS2, and CDS3. CDS1 and CDS2 are the major docking sites. CDS1 engages CTD segment T4aS5aphosP6aS7aY1bS2bP3b (Figure 3A, left panel), and CDS2 interacts with S7bY1cS2cP3cT4cS5cphosP6c (Figure 3A, right ° panel). The 1600 A2 of total buried surface area between the 17 aa CTD peptide and Cgt1 monomer B is almost equally split between CDS1 and CDS2. CDS3-S5bphos interactions result from a lattice contact between the two monomers in the asymmetric unit (Figure 3A, middle panel). CDS1 is composed of amino acids Lys152, Arg157, and Tyr165 that contribute electrostatic or hydrogenbonding contacts to the phosphate of S5a, plus residues Phe63, Leu163, Gly164, Tyr165, Phe196, and Met199 that make VDW contacts to P6aS7aY1bS2bP3b (Figure 3A, left panel). The absence of a side chain at Gly164 enables close VDW contacts with main chain atoms from S7a, positioning P6a and Y1b in pockets on either side of Gly164 (Figures 2 and 3). Gly164 is conserved in the capping enzymes of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, and is conservatively substituted by alanine in the mammalian capping

enzyme. This close contact allows formation of the only observed main chain hydrogen bond in the interface between the carbonyl oxygen of Pro160 in Cgt1 and the amide nitrogen of Y1b of the CTD. CDS1 makes two hydrogen bonds to the tyrosine hydroxyl of Y1b, including a direct hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Met199 and a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Lys197, a conserved residue within the guanylyltransferase nucleotide binding pocket (Figure 3A, left panel). Lys197 N directly coordinates the O6 atom of the guanosine base, and this specific CTD interaction could alter hydrogen-bonding networks that affect the integrity of the nucleotide binding pocket. Interestingly, these contacts were more distant in the enzyme-guanylate complex (monomer A) than in the enzyme-GTP complex (monomer B). The structural link between CTD interaction and the nucleotide binding pocket may be pertinent to the reported effects of CTD interaction and capping enzyme activity. Ser5-phosphorylated CTD directly stimulates the catalytic activity of the isolated mammalian RNA guanylyltransferase (Ho and Shuman, 1999; Wen and Shatkin, 1999), although the available evidence indicates that fungal guanylyltransferases are not subject to positive allosteric regulation by the CTD (Cho et al., 1998; Ho and Shuman, 1999). The physiological role of CDS1 was probed by intro-

ducing mutations at single positions within CGT1 and testing these for their ability to complement growth of a S. cerevisiae ceg1 strain by plasmid shuffle (Figure 3B) (see Experimental Procedures). Although no single amino acid was essential for ceg1 cell growth on FOAcontaining medium, several strains exhibited growth defects in comparison to the "wild-type" CGT1(1-395) strain. Detrimental mutations included: R157A, which eliminated an electrostatic interaction with S5aphos; G164E, G164T, G164L, and G164R, which imposed electrostatic or steric constraints to CTD interaction; and L163A, which reduced VDW contacts with Y1b. Growth defects were also evident for F63R, which disrupts a VDW contact with P3b, although this particular mutant exhibited instability when expressed and purified from E. coli when compared to the other mutant Cgt1 proteins. Although mutants G164L and G164R grew slower than wild-type, they were notably healthier than either G164E or G164T. G164E may exacerbate the phenotype through charge repulsion between Glu164 and S5aphos, whereas mutation to threonine, a -branched amino acid, would present a more significant steric impediment to CTD interaction than either Arg or Leu substitution, because longer and more flexible side chains could move more easily to accommodate CTD binding. Temperature sensitivity and cold sensitivity were observed for several mutants at both 23 C and 37 C, indicating

that relief of mutant phenotypes was only possible under optimal temperature conditions. With the exception of F63A (as noted above), the yield and solubility of each of the mutant guanylyltransferases was similar to that of wild-type Cgt1 when the recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli, suggesting that the mutations did not elicit global defects in protein folding (data not shown). CDS2 is composed of Asp175, which forms a bidentate hydrogen bond from O 1 and O 2 to the hydroxyl of Y1c, plus Arg140, Lys178, and Lys193, which coordinate the phosphate oxygens of S5cphos (Figure 3A, right panel). Additional VDW contacts are observed between Thr167, Met171, and Phe196 and the aromatic ring of Y1c. Although CDS2 interacts with a number of individual amino acids, CDS2 contacts are not as extensive as those observed in CDS1, and in vivo analysis revealed that mutations at seven individual positions within CDS2 did not significantly affect complementation of ceg1 (Figure 3B, right panel). CDS3 from Cgt1 monomer A consists of residues Y203, H204, and K382, which contact the phosphate of S5b of the CTD peptide bound to monomer B (Figure 3A, middle panel). Individual alanine substitution of these three Cgt1 residues had no discernable effect on ceg1 complementation (Figure 3B, middle panel). The extended CTD conformation enables the 17 aa CTD to interact with Cgt1 residues along a binding sur° face that extends over 40 A. Thus, any single amino acid mutation is unlikely to dominate the determinants of Cgt1 affinity for the CTD. Consistent with this, dramatic phenotypes were not observed for most individual amino acid substitutions within either CDS1 or CDS2. To confirm the structural observations and assess whether paired mutations would result in synergistically detrimental growth phenotypes when compared to single mutations alone, we assayed double and triple mutations within CDS1 or CDS2. In addition, we combined mutations within CDS1 and CDS2 to assess synergy between the two CTD docking sites on the guanylyltransferase surface (Figure 3C). Double mutations within CDS1 included R157A-Y165A and L163A-F196A. R157A-Y165A removed two components of the CDS1 interaction with S5aphos, whereas L163A-F196A removed two components of the hydrophobic surface involved in interactions with Y1b. Each paired substitution resulted in synergistic conditional growth defects when compared to either single mutant alone (Figure 3C, left panel). Double and triple mutations within CDS2 included those that affect the hydrophobic interaction with Y1c (M171A-F196A), and several that removed side chains in direct contact with S5cphos (R140A-K178A, R140A-K193A, K178A-K193A, and R140A-K178A-K193A) (Figure 3C, middle panel). Although M171A-F196A resulted in a growth defect that was more severe than either M171A or F196A, the other mutations within CDS2 did not elicit synergistic conditional effects similar to those observed in CDS1. To assess if CDS1 and CDS2 were functionally linked, we constructed mutations to alter residues observed in direct contact with either S5aphos or S5cphos, thus removing elements that serve to anchor both phosphorylated Ser5 CTD positions (Figure 3C, right panel). When CDS1 mutant R157A was combined with K178A-K193A, it re-

sulted in a severe conditional growth defect at all temperatures. A similar defect was observed when R157A was combined with R140A-K193A. Each paired CDS1CDS2 mutation resulted in phenotypes that were more severe than other mutant combinations, and these data are consistent with a functional link between the two CDS elements as observed in our structure. In summary, most single mutations in the Cgt1 CDS elements do not elicit dramatic effects on cell growth. Genetic and structural data indicate that elements within CDS1 are more critical for CTD interaction than those in CDS2, although a synergy between CDS1 and CDS2 CTD interaction could be observed in yeast, indicating that both elements are utilized for proper function in vivo. Sequence comparisons of guanylyltransferase family members suggest that residues involved in CTD interaction are only moderately conserved with respect to side chain properties. Thus, whereas the same CTD elements are recognized by guanylyltransferases from different species (see above), the CTD binding surfaces of the guanylyltransferases have diverged during speciation. Structural Plasticity in CTD Recognition Revealed by Comparisons between Capping Enzyme-CTD and Pin1-CTD Complexes The Cgt1-CTD complex represents the first structure determined for a protein bound to more than one CTD heptad repeat, but it is the second instance of a structure for the CTD bound to a physiologically relevant protein, the first being the complex of CTD with the peptidylproline isomerase Pin1. Pin1 regulates a subset of mitotic proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and is essential for cell cycle progression (Crenshaw et al., 1998; Wells et al., 1999). Pin1 and its S. cerevisiae homolog Ess1 have also been implicated in regulating the effector functions of the RNA polymerase II CTD, and Ess1/Pin1 is known to bind directly to the phosphorylated form of the CTD (Morris et al., 1999). Pin1, a member of the group IV WW protein family, displays a strong binding preference within the WW domain for peptides that contain (Sphos/Tphos)P dipeptides, especially within consensus sequences WFYSphosPR or PxSphosP (Yaffe et al., 1997; Verdecia et al., 2000). The structural basis for Pin1 WW domain specificity was revealed by a crystal structure of Pin1 in complex with a single consensus CTD repeat phosphorylated at Ser2 and Ser5 (Verdecia et al., 2000). Different secondary structures were observed for the CTD bound to Pin1 versus Cgt1. The CTD complexed to Cgt1 sites CDS1 and CDS2 adopts a -like extended conformation, whereby every other residue is oriented toward or away from the protein surface (Figures 4A and 4B). In contrast, the CTD assumes an extended coil conformation in the Pin1 complex, one that resembles the conformation of a type II polyproline helix (Verdecia et al., 2000). This conformation projects every third residue onto a unique face of the coil, such that Ser2 and Ser5 emanate from one face, Pro3 and Pro6 from another, and Tyr1, Thr4, and Ser7 from yet another face (Figure 4C). Thus, the CTD is apparently capable of adopting different structures that are templated by its particular binding partner.

(A), (B), and (C) are shown in stereo and arranged so that protein surfaces would be located below the CTD peptide in each panel.

Although Pin1 and Cgt1 interact with fundamentally different CTD structures, they both recognize trans proline residues at positions 3 and 6 through VDW contacts at their respective interfaces (Verdecia et al., 2000). In both instances, modeling revealed that CTD proline isomerization to cis configurations would preclude binding due to steric constraints. Consistent with its high specificity for (Sphos/Tphos)P dipeptides, Pin1 exhibits more extensive interactions with these side chains in comparison to the Cgt1-CTD complex. It is noteworthy that only Ser5-PO4 is recognized in the two complexes, even though Pin1 was bound to a CTD heptad repeat phosphorylated at both Ser2 and Ser5. CTD interactions diverge significantly with respect to Tyr1, a residue that appears to play a central role at both interfaces within Cgt1 CDS1 and CDS2. Tyr1 is neither required for, nor participates directly in, CTD interactions with Pin1 (Yaffe et al., 1997; Verdecia et al., 2000). Heterotrimeric Quaternary Structure of the Candida Capping Apparatus C. albicans and S. cerevisiae guanylyltransferases form stable heteromeric complexes with the RNA triphosphatase components of their respective capping apparati. The binding of triphosphatase to guanylyltransferase

elicits two beneficial outcomes. First, the triphosphatase stabilizes the inherently labile guanylyltransferase against rapid inactivation at physiological temperatures (Hausmann et al., 2001). In addition, the inhibition of guanylyltransferase activity when bound to phosphorylated CTD is alleviated when S. cerevisiae Ceg is in complex with Cet (Cho et al., 1998). Second, the physical tethering facilitates recruitment of triphosphatase to the pol II elongation complex, insofar as the guanylyltransferase binds directly to the phosphorylated CTD, but the triphosphatase does not (McCracken et al., 1997; Cho et al., 1998). When expressed under control of their endogenous promoters, mutations that disrupt interactions between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase are either lethal or result in temperature-sensitive growth phenotypes in vivo. However, overexpression of the triphosphatase or guanylyltransferase (by increasing gene dosage and/or linkage to a strong promoter) can rescue these phenotypes, implying the existence of alternative mechanisms for access of the capping enzymes to the pre-mRNA (Lehman et al., 1999; Ho et al., 1999; Takase et al., 2000; Hausmann et al., 2001; Pei et al., 2001b; Takagi et al., 2002). The quaternary structure for native C. albicans capping enzyme complex has not been reported. A 2:1 heterotrimeric complex between S. cerevisiae triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase was reconstituted in vitro from purified recombinant subunits (Lehman et al., 1999). However, other models for the quaternary structure of the S. cerevisiae capping enzyme complex have been proposed (Yamada-Okabe et al., 1998). To more accurately determine their quaternary structures, the S. cerevisiae and C. albicans guanylyltransferase and triphosphatase subunits were coexpressed in E. coli to enable complex formation in vivo. Heteromeric complexes were purified by affinity chromatography, tag removal, and gel filtration, and then analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation. The C. albicans complex sedimented as a discrete component with a molecular mass of 110 kDa, most consistent with a heterotrimeric quaternary structure composed of two triphosphatase molecules (CaCet1[202-521]; 37 kDa each) and one guanylyltransferase molecule (Cgt1[1-395]; 46 kDa). The S. cerevisiae complex sedimented as a single 115 kDa species, indicative of a heterotrimeric complex between two molecules of Cet1(241-549) (35 kDa each) plus one molecule of Ceg1(1-397) (46 kDa) (data not shown; see Experimental Procedures). An RNA Triphosphatase Binding Site in the OB Domain of Cgt1 The triphosphatase component of the triphosphataseguanylyltransferase interface has been localized to a 31 aa peptide that suffices for binding to guanylyltransferase (Lehman et al., 1999; Ho et al., 1999; Takase et al., 2000). The peptide domain, and an essential WAQKW motif in particular, is conserved in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatases. The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae triphosphatase Cet1 revealed that both tryptophan side chains are located on the protein surface in solvent-exposed configurations (Lima et al., 1999). The guanylyltransferase component of the triphos-

phatase-guanylyltransferase interface remains largely uncharted, except for the demonstration that the OB domain of the guanylyltransferase suffices for binding to the triphosphatase in vitro (Hausmann et al., 2001) and the suggestion from genetic suppression analysis that interstrand loops of the OB domain may be involved in this interaction (Ho et al., 1998; Cho et al., 1998; Hausmann et al., 2001). The present crystal structure of Cgt1 reveals several features within the OB domain that are unique when compared to the Chlorella virus capping enzyme structure. These include cross-domain interactions between the N-terminal 6 amino acids and the OB domain, an additional helix from aa 305 to 316, and a large loop from aa 258 to 281 that projects from the top of the OB domain (partly disordered in monomer B, but fully ordered in monomer A within the context of a lattice contact) (Figures 1 and 5A). These Cgt1 elements are conserved in length and amino acid composition in the S. cerevisiae capping enzyme Ceg1, which also forms a complex in trans with its triphosphatase. Several regions within these segments are either abridged or missing in the S. pombe (Pce1), mammalian (Mce1), and Chlorella virus guanylyltransferases, which do not interact in trans with their respective triphosphatase components (Figure 5B). The N-terminal 6 amino acids were removed and seven hydrophobic side chains highlighted in Figure 5A were substituted individually by alanine (or in the case of Trp309 by histidine), and the mutant alleles were tested by plasmid shuffle for complementation of ceg1 . Deletion of the N-terminal 6 amino acids resulted in slow growth at 30 C and 37 C, as gauged by colony size on rich medium (Figure 5D). W309H and L312A mutations within the helix were lethal. F258A, Y278A, and L319A mutations within the loop elicited ts growth defects (Figure 5D). Y275A and L276A had no effect on growth per se, but resulted in synergistic lethality when combined with the ts Y278A mutation (Figure 5D). Previous mutational analysis of S. cerevisiae Ceg1 reported ts and lethal phenotypes for strains carrying substitutions L340A-K341A and L347A-N348A, respectively (Hausmann et al., 2001). Leu340 of Ceg1 corresponds to Cgt1 Leu312 and Leu347 of Ceg1 corresponds to Cgt1 Leu319 (Figure 5B). The ts growth defect of the S. cerevisiae L340A-K341A mutant could be suppressed by overexpression of S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase. Here we found that overexpression of Candida RNA triphosphatase suppressed the ts phenotypes of the Candida Cgt1 mutants N 6, F258A, Y278A, and L319A (Figure 5D), suggesting that a defect in the guanylyltransferase-triphosphatase interaction is responsible for the phenotype. To directly assess mutant Cgt1 interaction with CaCet1, each Cgt1 mutant was tagged and coexpressed with untagged CaCet1 in bacteria, and Cgt1-containing complexes were recovered by affinity chromatography. The concentrations of the affinity-purified proteins were measured and the preparations were analyzed by SDSPAGE. Analytical centrifugation indicated that 98% of the wild-type guanylyltransferase molecules were bound to the triphosphatase (data not shown), consistent with a CaCet1:Cgt1 ratio of 2:1 for the "wild-type" complex as determined by photometric scanning of the

stained gel. Assuming a simple Kd relationship between uncomplexed and complexed components (Kd [Cgt1] [Dimer CaCet1]/[Cgt1 · Dimer CaCet1]), we can estimate a Kd of 1 nM for wild-type Cgt1 and also gauge relative differences in Kd for the Cgt1 mutants by measuring the amount of CaCet1 pulled down in the complex. For example, the protein concentration is measured by photometric scanning of the gel, and the relative amounts of Cgt1 and CaCet1 are measured to determine the concentration of CaCet1. If 90% of CaCet1 was recovered in comparison to the "wild-type" complex at a Cgt1 concentration of 1 M, this corresponds to a 26-fold increase in Kd, whereas if 60% of CaCet1 was recovered in the complex, this corresponds to a 660fold increase in Kd. Using this relationship, a log plot for estimated relative binding defects (expressed as Kd[Mut]/Kd[WT]) was derived (Figure 5C; see Experimental Procedures). A positive correlation was observed between mutational defects in CaCet1-Cgt1 interaction in vitro and growth phenotypes in vivo. The ts F258A and Y278A mutants exhibited 100-fold defects in CaCet1 interaction, whereas the ts L319A and N 6 mutants showed 10-fold defects. The lethal Y275A-L276A-Y278A triple mutant exhibited a 1000-fold effect on Kd. Two other lethal mutants, W309H and L312A, displayed less severe defects in CaCet1 binding than those observed for the ts mutants, suggesting other defects (in addition to impaired triphosphatase binding) may contribute to their lethality. Mutations Y275A or L276A, which had no effect on ceg1 complementation in vivo, were without effect on CaCet1 interaction in vitro. Structural Insights into the Guanylyltransferase Mechanism The C. albicans Cgt1 tertiary structure resembles those previously determined for Chlorella virus capping enzyme and Chlorella virus DNA ligase. The Cgt1 NT domain (aa 1­243) aligns to the viral capping enzyme with ° 1.9 A rmsd over 210 aa (26% side chain identity) and to ° the viral DNA ligase with 2.6 A rmsd over 147 aa (16% identity). The Cgt1 OB domain (aa 244­390) aligns to ° the viral capping enzyme OB domain with 1.8 A rmsd over 72 aa (28% identity) and to the viral ligase OB ° domain with 3.2 A rmsd over 65 aa (6% identity). Chlorella virus GTase structures have been determined for the enzyme-guanylate intermediate (closed configuration), in complex with GTP (open and closed configurations) and in complex with a cap analog GpppG (open ° ° configuration) (Hakansson et al., 1997; Hakansson and Wigley, 1998). The open configuration is one in which the OB domain retroflexes away from the NT domain to widen the interdomain cleft, whereas the closed configuration is one in which the OB domain flexes toward the NT domain and narrows the cleft. The enzyme must ° close to catalyze enzyme-guanylate formation (Hakansson et al., 1997), and it may again require closure during GMP transfer to the nascent mRNA chain, whereas an open guanylyltransferase configuration is required at least three times during the catalytic cycle: for GTP binding, for binding of ppRNA, and for release of the capped RNA product. The Cgt1-GMP structure revealed a new intermediate

Comparison of the Tertiary Structures and Active Sites of Candida and Chlorella Virus Guanylyltransferases (A) Superposition of the N-terminal nucleotidyl transferase domains of Candida (cyan) and Chlorella virus (yellow) enzyme-GMP complexes highlights the movement of the OB domain, presumably to allow ingress of the RNA 5 end.

lights differences in the orientation of the OB fold with respect to the NT domain (Figure 6A) and the conformation of the bound nucleotide (discussed below). The Chlorella virus capping enzyme, which has just transferred GMP from GTP to the covalent enzyme-(lysylN)-GMP intermediate in the crystal, is observed with the OB domain closed over the nucleotide-exposed surface of the NT domain. In the Cgt1-GMP structure, where guanylylation occurred prior to crystallization, the OB domain is pivoted about a point in the interdomain linker such that the NT domain surface containing the lysylGMP is fully exposed and poised to bind ppRNA (Figures 1 and 6A). It is noteworthy that phosphate ion was observed near the Cgt1-guanylate, coordinated by the side chains of Gln44, Arg92, and Lys241, which are conserved in other fungal and mammalian capping enzymes. This phosphate likely marks the position of the 5 diphosphate RNA terminus prior to the second GMP transfer step of the capping pathway (Figures 6B and 6C). The guanosine nucleoside in Cgt1-GMP adopts an anti configuration. This is in contrast to the syn conformation of guanosine in the Chlorella virus capping enzyme-GMP adduct. Superimposition of the Candida and Chlorella virus capping enzyme-GMP complexes highlights the rotation of the sugar about the glycosidic bond (Figure 6B) and an accompanying movement of the phospholysine side chain (Figure 6C). The observation that adenosine is also in the anti conformation in the Chlorella virus DNA ligase-AMP crystal (Odell et al., 2000) and the NAD -dependent Tfi ligase-AMP crystal (Lee et al., 2000), both of which represent open conformational states of the OB domain, indicates that a change in nucleoside conformation from syn to anti after domain reopening is a conserved feature of the nucleotidyl transferase superfamily. Conclusions The Candida albicans guanylyltransferase-CTD complex illuminates the structural basis for interactions between an essential cellular mRNA processing enzyme and multiple phosphorylated heptad repeats derived

from the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Comparison to the Pin1-CTD structure shows that the CTD is structurally plastic and can assume markedly different conformations depending on its binding partner. Inherent structural flexibility, combined with remodeling of CTD primary structure by kinases and phosphatases, provides a versatile mechanism by which the CTD can recruit a variety of structurally dissimilar proteins during discrete stages of transcription (initiation, elongation, and termination) and cotranscriptional mRNA processing. The Cgt1-CTD complex highlights two extended -like conformations for two distinct CTD elements. In contrast to a fully extended structure, the CTD folds on the capping enzyme surface so as to bring two tyrosine residues ° from consecutive heptad repeats to within 5.5 A of each other. This structure effectively "loops out" one heptad repeat, which is loosely associated with the surface of the capping enzyme. It is conceivable, indeed likely, that this and other proteins containing more than one CTD docking site may loop out variable numbers of heptads as they search the CTD array for heptad primary structures best suited to each CDS. The Cgt1 structure provides new insights to how protein interaction surfaces are compartmentalized within the capping enzyme. We identify elements unique to the budding yeast guanylyltransferase that are implicated in formation of a bifunctional capping enzyme complex with the yeast RNA triphosphatase. Whereas triphosphatase interactions occur on the "top" of the guanylyltransferase OB fold, the CTD interactions occur entirely within the base of the nucleotidyl transferase domain. The open form of Cgt1-GMP with bound phosphate provides a snapshot of a capping reaction intermediate that had not been visualized previously and underscores how conformational steps are coordinated with the chemical steps of nucleotidyl transfer.
Experimental Procedures Purification of Candida Guanylyltransferase Cgt1(1-395) was produced in bacteria as a N-terminal His6-Smt3 fusion protein (Mossessova and Lima, 2000). The pET-based expres-

sion plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Novagen). A 10 liter culture was grown by fermentation at 37 C to an A600 of 4. The culture was cooled to 20 C, induced with IPTG at 1 mM, and incubated for 4 hr. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 20% sucrose, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol (BME), and 20 g/ml lysozyme. The lysate was sonicated and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. His-tagged Smt3-Cgt1 was purified by metal-affinity chromatography, and the His-Smt3 tag was removed by Ulp1 proteolysis. Cgt1 was purified free of the tag by gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography. Approximately 12 mg of 98% pure Cgt1 was isolated per liter of E. coli culture as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coommassie staining. Selenomethionyl (SeMet) protein was produced in E. coli B834 (DE3) (Hendrickson et al., 1990). Cgt1 was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 60 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM BME, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 C.

according to solvent and protein composition, respectively (Laue et al., 1992). Gauging Effects of Cgt1 Mutations on Binding to CaCet1 Wild-type and mutant CGT1(1-395) alleles were inserted into pET15b to generate N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged Cgt1. pET15b-CGT1 (1-395) plasmids were cotransformed with pET29b-CaCET1(202520) into E. coli BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL. Cultures (40 ml) were induced, and soluble lysates were prepared as described above. Cgt1 and associated CaCet1 were purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. The total protein concentration of affinity-purified material was measured by Bradford analysis, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, stained with Sypro (Bio-Rad), integrated, and quantified by photometry using Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Using the integrated intensities obtained from the wild-type complex that was determined to contain 2 mol of CaCet1 per mol of Cgt1 by analytical ultracentrifugation, the relative concentrations of mutant Cgt1 and CaCet1 were calculated. Because the CaCet1 dimer is present in the affinity-purified material by virtue of its association with tagged Cgt1, the molar concentration of Cgt1 within a complex can be inferred to be half the concentration of CaCet1. The concentration of free CaCet1 could not be derived directly from this assay, although it was present in excess of Cgt1 as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis of E. coli lysates prior to affinity purification. A lower boundary for Kd can therefore be calculated by using the concentration of free Cgt1 as an estimate for the concentration of free CaCet1 prior to affinity purification. Thus, the concentrations for Cgt1, CaCet1, and CaCet1·Cgt1 could be inferred, and these estimates were used to calculate estimated relative Kd values (Figure 5C).

Crystallographic Analysis Cgt1 (190 M) was incubated with 300 M CTD Ser5-PO4 peptide for 30 min prior to crystallization. Crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion against a well solution containing 3.0 M ammonium phosphate, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 3% [v/v] DMSO) and cryo-protected ° with 30% xylitol. SeMet crystals diffracted X-rays to 2.6 A (P21, a ° ° ° 47.112 A, b 124.970 A, c 92.705 A, 90 , 100.54 ). Single wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected at NSLS beamline X9A (Brookhaven, NY) using a MAR 165 mm CCD (Hendrickson, 1991). Data were reduced with DENZO, SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997), and CCP4 (1994) (Table 1). ° 14 Se sites were used to calculate 2.7 A phases with SOLVE and RESOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999). The asymmetric unit contained two Cgt1 monomers, and each N-terminal catalytic domain was traced using O (Jones et al., 1991), refined with 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). NCS was released to refine and trace the OB domains due to dissimilari° ties between the two monomers (1.7 A rmsd over 362 common C atoms). When refinement neared completion, a model for CTD phosphopeptide residues was added (Table 1). The model, including all CTD residues, has excellent geometry with no Ramachandran outliers.

Cgt1 Function In Vivo in S. cerevisiae Mutational effects on Cgt1 function in vivo were tested by plasmid shuffle in a S. cerevisiae ceg1 strain containing wild-type CEG1 on a CEN URA3 plasmid (Schwer et al., 2001). Wild-type and mutant CGT1(1-395) alleles were inserted into the vector pYN132 (CEN TRP1) in which CGT1 expression is driven by the yeast TPI1 promoter. YBS2 was transformed with the pYN-CGT1 plasmids. Trp colonies were streaked on agar medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to select for loss of the CEG1 URA3 plasmid. Lethal mutations were those that failed to yield 5-FOA-resistant colonies after incubation for 5 days at 23 C or 30 C. Viable CGT1 mutants were grown in YPD broth (with 0.03% adenine) to an A600 0.5. Aliquots (3 l) of serial 10-fold dilutions (10 1, 10 2, 10 3) were spotted onto YPD plates, which were incubated 3 days at 23 C or 2 days at 30 C and 37 C. Dosage suppression of cgt1 phenotypes by CaCET1 were assessed by transformation of the ceg1 strain with a CEN ADE2 plasmid containing CaCET1 under the control of the yeast TPI1 promoter. The resulting Ade strain was then transformed with various cgt1 alleles on CEN TRP1 plasmids.

Sedimentation Equilibrium Measurements were preformed on a Beckman XL-A Optima analytical ultracentrifuge with an An-60 Ti rotor at 20 C. Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl, loaded at an initial concentration of 8 M, and then centrifuged in a sixsector cell at rotor speeds of 6500 and 7500 rpm. Data were acquired at two wavelengths per rotor speed and processed simultaneously with a nonlinear least squares fitting routine (Johnson et al., 1981). Solvent density and protein partial specific volume were calculated
