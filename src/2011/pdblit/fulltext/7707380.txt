Joint X-Ray and NMR Refinement of the Yeast L30e-mRNA Complex
Jeffrey A. Chao and James R. Williamson* Department of Molecular Biology Department of Chemistry and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology The Scripps Research Institute 10550 North Torrey Pines Road La Jolla, California 92037 1997). The importance of these two GA dinucleotides steps and other residues in the internal loop was also shown in chemical modification experiments (Li et al., 1995). These biochemical studies showed that both the size of the internal loop and the identity of several nucleotides within it are necessary for high-affinity binding. The structure of L30e bound to the internal loop of the pre-mRNA was solved by NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1A) (Mao et al., 1999). L30e adopts an / / topology that is formed by eight alternating helix and strand segments. The RNA binding domain is located on one face of the protein and is formed by three loops that connect the secondary structure elements, one edge of the sheet, and a portion of the second helix. The RNA internal loop forms a purine stack that contains a reverse Hoogsteen base pair and a highly distorted phosphate backbone. The binding domains of both the protein and RNA become more ordered upon complex formation (Mao and Williamson, 1999b). After the NMR structure of the L30e-mRNA complex was solved, structures of two homologous proteins bound to RNAs with similar internal loops were determined. The structure of the spliceosomal 15.5 kDa protein bound to a fragment of the U4 snRNA and the L7Ae protein in the context of the Haloarcuta marismortui ribosome were solved by X-ray crystallography (Figures 1B and 1C) (Ban et al., 2000; Vidovic et al., 2000). These structures have many features in common with the L30emRNA complex. The proteins have / / topologies and use similar binding domains to recognize their cognate RNA targets. The U4 and 23S internal loops also contain sharp kinks in their phosphate backbones, and in each structure a single nucleotide is inserted into a pocket on the protein. Despite their global similarities, the hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions that stabilize the RNA internal loop structures differ from the ones reported for the L30e-mRNA complex. The U4 and 23S internal loops belong to the K-turn secondary structure motif or GA motif that contain tandem sheared G:A base pairs (Klein et al., 2001; Winkler et al., 2001). While the primary L30e mRNA sequence contains the consensus K-turn elements, the reported NMR structure contains two homopurine (G:G and A:A) base pairs instead. Here we report the structure of a maltose binding protein (MBP)-L30e-mRNA complex solved using an unusual NMR and X-ray joint refinement. A structure of the ° RNP solved using 3.24 A X-ray data clearly showed a difference in the RNA internal loop compared to the structure of the complex determined in the previous NMR study (Mao et al., 1999). Analysis of the NMR restraints revealed that the observed differences were due to a single misassigned imino proton, and that the previous NMR RNA internal loop structure was incorrect. Joint NMR and X-ray refinement of the RNP using all of the available structural data resulted in an improved model of the L30e-mRNA complex. The RNA internal loop structure determined in the joint refinement has all of the structural features of the K-turn secondary structure motif.

Summary L30e, a Saccharomyces cervisiae ribosomal protein, regulates its own expression by binding to a purinerich asymmetric internal loop located in both its premRNA and mature mRNA. A crystal structure of an MBP-L30e fusion protein in complex with an RNA containing the pre-mRNA regulatory site was solved at ° 3.24 A. Interestingly, the structure of the RNA differed from that observed in a previously determined NMR structure of the complex. Analysis of the NMR data led to the identification of a single imino proton resonance in the internal loop that had been incorrectly assigned and was principally responsible for the erroneous RNA structure. A structure refinement was performed using both the X-ray diffraction data and the NMR-derived distance and angle restraints. The joint NMR and X-ray refinement resulted in improved stereochemistry and lower crystallographic R factors. The RNA internal loop of the MBP-L30e-mRNA complex adopts the canonical K-turn fold. Introduction The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein L30e is an essential component of the large ribosomal subunit and regulates its own splicing and translation by binding to an internal loop structure in its pre-mRNA and mRNA (Dabeva et al., 1986; Dabeva and Warner, 1987; Eng and Warner, 1991; Li et al., 1996). The internal loop is located at the 5 end of the pre-mRNA transcript, directly adjacent to the 5 splice site, and binding of L30e to the internal loop prevents proper spliceosome assembly (Eng and Warner, 1991; Vilardell and Warner, 1994). In the spliced mRNA, the internal loop contains the start codon and binding of L30e reduces translation efficiency (Dabeva and Warner, 1993; Li et al., 1996). Autoregulation of L30e expression at these two steps allows L30e levels to be controlled in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The purine-rich asymmetric internal loop is composed of two nucleotides on one strand opposite of five nucleotides on the other and is flanked by two helical stems. In vitro selection experiments showed that five of these nucleotides must be purines, and there are two GA dinucleotides that are invariant in pools of RNAs selected for L30e binding (G11-A12 and G58-A59) (Li and White,

(B) Spliceosomal 15.5 kDa protein in complex with a U4 snRNA fragment. (C) L7Ae in complex with ribosomal fragment. The proteins (red) adopt / / topologies and use similar binding domains to recognize their RNA targets (blue). The overall structure of the RNA internal loops is also similar. A sharp kink in the phosphate backbone and a central nucleotide inserted into a pocket on the protein is clearly visible in each structure. The structural details of the internal loop differ between the L30e RNA and the other two RNAs, which belong to the K-turn motif. Differences in base pairing can be seen in the secondary structure diagrams. All figures unless otherwise specified were generated with PyMOL (Delano, 2002).

Results and Discussion X-Ray Crystallographic Structure Determination A MBP-L30e fusion protein was cocrystallized with a bipartite RNA that contained the asymmetric internal loop. Previous biochemical studies confirmed that the fusion protein binds to the RNA internal loop with similar affinity as the wild-type protein (Vilardell and Warner, 1994). Diffraction quality crystals of the MBP-L30e-RNA complex were obtained using a combinatorial approach that systematically varied the 5 and 3 overhangs of each RNA strand (Hoggan et al., 2003). The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement using a previously determined structure of the free MBP-L30e protein as the search model (Chao et al., 2003). MBPL30e (53 kDa) constitutes almost 85% of the mass of the complex (62.5 kDa), with MBP accounting for 67% of the total mass. Difference Fourier electron density maps after molecular replacement unambiguously show the phosphate backbone of the RNA (Figure 2). The tetragonal crystals contained one copy of the MBPL30e-RNA complex per asymmetric unit and the struc° ture of the complex was refined to a resolution of 3.24 A (Table 1). One stem of the RNA duplex (helix I) stacks on a symmetry-related copy of helix I from another RNP, while the other stem (helix II) does not make any intermo-

lecular contacts (Figure 3). Helix II is not well ordered and the terminal base pair is not identifiable in electron density maps. The nucleotides within the RNA internal loop, however, are well defined. The L30e portion of the fusion protein is well ordered except for a few residues at the N- and C termini. The linker sequence that connects L30e to MBP could not be observed in electron density. The MBP portion of the fusion protein is similar to the previously determined structures of MBP and also the structure of MBP seen in the free MBP-L30e fusion (Chao et al., 2003; Quiocho et al., 1997). L30e packs against the MBP portion of the fusion protein and a symmetry-related MBP molecule also makes several crystal contacts to another face of L30e. There is also a single crystal contact between Lys313 of a symmetryrelated MBP and the phosphate group of C8 in helix I. This contact, however, most likely does not alter the binding of L30e to the RNA internal loop. The X-ray structure of L30e is very similar to the one determined in the L30e-mRNA complex solved by NMR (Mao et al., 1999). Both L30e structures adopt an / / topology and the backbone atoms have a root-mean° square deviation (rmsd) of 2.39 A. The global fold of the RNA is also similar in the X-ray and NMR structures. Both of the structures have a sharp turn in the phosphate backbone in the middle of the asymmetric internal loop that allows for a highly stacked purine sandwich. The

Figure 2. Fourier Difference Density after Molecular Replacement The A-form RNA helix is clearly visible after molecular replacement with MBP-L30e. Difference fourier density was contoured at 3 (blue), 4 (purple), 5 (cyan), and 3 (red). The phosphates can be positioned in the 5 density, which allows the RNA backbone to be unambiguously traced. This figure was generated with Xtalview and Raster3D (McRee, 1999; Merrit and Bacon, 1997).

central nucleotide of the internal loop is also rotated away from the phosphate backbone and into a pocket on the protein in both structures. The overall orientation of L30e to the RNA internal loop is also similar in the X-ray and NMR complexes. The detailed hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions of the RNA internal loop, however, differ between the two structures. In the NMR structure, a reverse Hoogsteen base pair is formed between G11:G56 and another purine base pair is formed by A12:A55 (Mao et

al., 1999). In the X-ray structure, two tandem G:A base pairs form between G11:A59 and A12:G58. The observed differences could have arisen due to differences in sample conditions (temperature, pH, ionic strength), the state of the sample (crystal versus solution), or due to experimental errors or artifacts. The X-ray structure of the L30e RNA internal loop shared many features in common with the K-turn motif, which led us to carefully examine the restraints used in the previously reported NMR structure refinement (Klein et al., 2001; Mao et al., 1999).

Analysis of the Previous NMR Data and Structure Calculation with Modified Restraints The NMR structure determination of the L30e-mRNA complex was complicated by spectral overlap and exchange broadened resonances (Mao and Williamson, 1999a). These challenges necessitated not only uniform 13 C/15N labeling of both the RNA and protein but also base-selective 13C/15N labeling of the RNA and NMR analysis of five single point mutations in the RNA internal loop. Despite these substantial efforts, we now believe a critical imino proton resonance in the internal loop was misassigned. The RNA (547) and RNA-protein (73) distance restraints used in the NMR structure calculation of the L30e-RNA complex were mapped onto the X-ray struc° ture. All of the inter-proton distances were less than 6 A,

except for a small group involving a single common proton. This outlier was the G11 imino proton that was involved in five intramolecular and four intermolecular NOEs (Mao et al., 1999) (Figures 4A and 4B). Four of the five intramolecular and all of the intermolecular NOEbased distance restraints involving this proton reso° nance had interproton distances greater than 8 A when mapped on to the X-ray structure. The G11 imino proton assignment was crucial for the determination of the NMR internal loop structure because the medium-strong NOE to G56H8 in combination with the absence of an observable G11 amino was the principle evidence for the un-

usual reverse Hoogsteen base pair between G11 and G56 (Mao and Williamson, 1999a). It was possible to reconcile the discrepancy by reassignment of this imino proton resonance to G58, which had been unassigned in the original NMR study. The position of the G58 imino proton in the X-ray structure satisfies the violated distance restraints, making the NMR data consistent with the X-ray structure (Figure 4C). A more detailed description of the analysis of the previous NMR data can be found in Experimental Procedures. There is an intrinsically low density of protons in the purine-rich internal loop. This situation was exacerbated

Rmsds were calculated for the RNA internal loop (10­13, 54­60) and L30e (10­100). a ° ° ° Restraints were removed for the GG reverse Hoogsteen base pair (G11H1-G56N7, 1.95 A; G11H22-G56O6, 1.95 A; G11N1-G56N7, 2.95 A; ° ° ° ° G11N2-G56O6, 2.95A), G11 amino (G11H21-G11H1 , 3.4 A; G11H21-A12H2, 3.9 A), G56 amino (G56H21-A55H3 , 2.9 A), G13 hydroxyl (G13HO2 ° ° ° ° A59N1, 1.95 A; G13O2 -A59N1, 2.95 A), and A55 hydroxyl (A55HO2 -A12N1, 1.95 A; A55O2 -A12N1, 2.95 A). b Restraints were reassigned to reflect G58 imino reassignment. NOEs from G58H1 to G11H1 , G11H8, G56H1 , G56H8, Ser29HN, Ser29HB1, Ser29HB2, and Thr30HN were modified. c ° Nonexperimental restraints for the sheared G:A base pairs were added to restraint set 3. The restraints were added for G11N2-A59N7 (2.95 A), ° ° ° G11H21-A59N7 (1.95 A), A59N6-G11N3 (2.95 A), and A59H61-G11N3 (1.95 A). Identical restraints were added for the A12-G58 base pair.

by the fact that many of the exchangeable protons were either unobserved or unassigned due to line broadening. It seemed plausible that the erroneous imino proton assignment and the assumptions derived from it were principally responsible for the observed differences between the X-ray and NMR structures. For this reason, NMR structure calculations were performed with several different restraint sets to observe the effect of certain restraints on the structure of the RNA internal loop. An NMR structure calculation was initially performed with the entire restraint set contained in the 1CN9 PDB submission (Mao et al., 1999). This calculation served as a reference point for comparing the effects of different restraints (Table 2). When 11 nonexperimentally based restraints, including the G:G reverse Hoogsteen base pair restraints, were removed from the restraint set, this structure calculation did not converge. The G:G reverse Hoogsteen base pair restraints, in particular, were found to be critical for the structure calculation to converge. If the imino proton resonance is reassigned from G11 to G58 and its NOEs are appropriately adjusted, the structure calculation still showed relatively poor convergence. Thus, even if the imino proton resonance had been properly assigned, it is likely that there was not enough NMR data to accurately calculate a structure. A structure calculation was also performed with a restraint set that included the reassigned G58 imino and also nonexperimentally based distance restraints for the G:A sheared base pairs. Despite there being three less restraints than the published restraint set, this structure calculation showed better convergence, fewer restraint violations, and had a lower overall energy. While NMR pulse sequences exist for experimentally verifying these hydrogen bonds (Majumdar et al., 2001), the size of the L30e-mRNA complex prohibits their use in this instance. These calculations clearly demonstrate that a few crucial pieces of information can dramatically alter the outcome of an NMR structure calculation, especially when the restraint density is low. Comparison of Published NMR and X-Ray Structures The differences between the RNA internal loop structures in the published NMR and X-ray structures are localized to the region adjacent to helix I. The positions

of A55, G56, A59, and A12 generally remain the same ° and these bases have an rmsd of 1.55 A for all heavy atoms (Figures 5A and 5B). The relative positions of these bases maintain the overall shape of the internal loop. The platform of the internal loop is stabilized by a type I A minor interaction between A59 and the G13:C54 base pair in both structures. There are, however, several important differences between the NMR and X-ray structures of the internal loop. In the NMR structure, a G:U wobble base pair is formed between G10 and U60 at the top of helix I, directly adjacent to the internal loop (Figures 5A and 5C). This wobble pair was directly observed in NMR studies of the free RNA, but the characteristic, strong iminoimino NOE was not seen in studies of the complex (Mao and Williamson, 1999a). Despite this missing information, the G:U wobble pair was restrained in the NMR structure calculation of the complex. In the X-ray structure, the wobble pair was not observed to form and, instead, the amino of G10 makes a hydrogen bond to O4 of U60 (Figures 5B and 5D). The G:U amino-4-carbonyl base pairing arrangement widens both the major and minor groove. Biochemical studies found that replacing the guanosine residue with an inosine-reduced protein binding by a factor of 3 (White and Li, 1996). Mutagenesis studies also showed that replacement of the G:U pair with a G:C base pair at this position reduced L30e binding by 100-fold, and an A:C wobble pair, which is isosteric to the G:U wobble pair, resulted in a 160fold reduction in binding (White and Li, 1996). The G:U amino-4-carbonyl base pair found in the X-ray structure is more consistent with the biochemical data than the G:U wobble pair previously reported in the NMR structure. The base stacking in helix I is extended by two sheared G:A base pairs in the X-ray structure. The formation of base pairs between G11:A59 and A12:G58 is different from the G11:G56 and A12:A55 base pairs reported in the NMR structure (Figures 5E and 5F). The G11:A59 base pair only forms one hydrogen bond between the G11 amino and A59 N7 because of the extended conformation caused by the G:U amino-4-carbonyl base pair. The second hydrogen bond between the A59 amino and G11N3 could be water mediated. The other G:A base pair between A12 and G58 forms the two expected hydrogen

Figure 5. Comparison of Published NMR and X-Ray Structures of the Internal Loop (A and B) Global comparison of the NMR and X-ray internal loops. Both structures contain a sharp kink in the phosphate backbone in the middle of the internal loop and insert A57 (lime) into a pocket on the protein. Differences in base stacking can be observed between the two structures. In the NMR structure, the purine stack is formed by G11 (cyan), A12 (purple), and A59 (green). The stacking arrangement in the X-ray structure is considerably different. G58 (brown) stacks upon G11 (cyan) and a central purine stack is formed by G56 (yellow), A12 (purple), and A59 (green). The position of G58 (brown) also differs between the two in internal loop structures. In the NMR structure, G58 is extruded from the rest of the internal loop. In the X-ray structure, this nucleotide is included in the purine stack. (C and D) Comparison of NMR and X-ray structures of G10:U60 base pair. A G:U wobble pair forms in the NMR structure and a G:U amino4-carbonyl forms in the X-ray structure. (E and F) Comparison of NMR and X-ray structures of purine base pairs. In the NMR structure, homopurine base pairs are formed between G11 (cyan) and G56 (yellow) and A12 (purple) and A55 (pink).

bonds for sheared G:A pairs. The position of G58 in the X-ray structure is considerably different from the NMR structure where the base was bulged out from the rest of the internal loop (Figures 5A and 5B). The formation

of the tandem G:A base pairs is consistent with previous biochemical and SELEX experiments that showed that these four nucleotides were invariant and strictly conserved for high-affinity protein binding (Li and White,

Joint Refinement of L30e-mRNA Complex 1171

1997). There was no direct NMR evidence for the A12:A55 base pair and the hydrogen bonding between A12 N1and A55 2 OH was inferred from their proximity in the NMR structure. The sugar to base hydrogen bond, however, is also consistent with the position of A12 and A55 in the X-ray structure. The G:G reverse Hoogsteen base pair assignment was made on the basis of a medium-strong NOE between the G11 H1 and G56 H8. This imino proton assignment, however, was incorrect as discussed earlier. The base stacking is also significantly different between the NMR and X-ray structures of the internal loop because of the altered base pairing. In the X-ray structure, the two tandem G:A pairs are involved in crossstrand stacking where G58 stacks upon G11 and A12 stacks upon A59. The cross-strand stacking is extended by G56 stacking upon A12 (Figure 5B). Furthermore, this purine stack is then capped by an intermolecular van der Waals contact with the aromatic side chain of Phe85. The central purine stack in the NMR structure consists of A59, A12, and G11 (Figure 5A). This noticeable difference is once again attributed to the G11 imino proton being incorrectly assigned because NOEs from this proton to A12 H2 and H2 determined the stacking of G11 on A12. Inclusion of all seven internal loop nucleotides in stacking interactions increases the stacking potential of the X-ray structure over the NMR structure. The stacking of the internal loop in the X-ray structure is also continued through the G:U amino-4-carbonyl base pair and the rest of the helix I. This extended stacking is not observed in the NMR structure. Despite the structural differences in the RNA internal loops of the X-ray and NMR structures, the RNA binding domains of the proteins are very similar (Figure 6). The binding domains (residues 25­37, 46­54, and 82­90) ° have an rmsd of 1.39 A. The most prominent intermolecular interaction, the Phe85 van der Waals contact to G56, is found in both structures. In the NMR structure, Lys28 penetrates the internal loop to satisfy NOEs between the Lys28 side chain and the ribose and H8 of G58. The position of Lys28 is not so intrusive in the X-ray structure because of the structural rearrangement of the internal loop around G58. In the X-ray structure, Lys28 is within potential hydrogen bond distance of the O6 of both G10 and G11 and may stabilize the G:U amino-4-carbonyl base pair. Substitution of Lys28 with alanine results in a 30-fold reduction in binding affinity (S. White, personal communication). Due to the repositioning of G58, the Arg52 guanidinium group no longer makes hydrogen bonds to O6 and N7 of G58 as in the NMR structure, and instead makes a specific electrostatic interaction to the G58 phosphate group. There are other positively charged residues in the binding domain that do not make specific contacts to the RNA. The Lys32 and Arg86 side chains do not have any intermolecular NOEs in the NMR structure or well-defined electron density in the X-ray structure. These residues, however, are highly conserved among L30e family members and could be required for neutralizing the negative charge of the phosphate backbone. Another conserved residue, Arg35, makes a crystal contact to a symmetry-related MBP in the X-ray structure. This residue, however, did not make any intermolecular NOEs in the NMR structure,

Figure 6. Comparison of Published NMR and X-Ray Structures of L30e RNA Binding Domain Superposition of the X-ray structure (red) and NMR structure (green) ° have an rmsd of 1.39 A for C atoms. The RNA internal loop (blue) shown is from the X-ray structure. Nearly all of the protein-RNA contacts are identical between the two structures. A57 is recognized by an Asn residue in both structures. In the NMR structure, this interaction is performed by Asn47. In the X-ray structure, Asn47 makes a crystal contact with Pro271, and Asn74 interacts with A57 instead.

so the precise role of Arg35 in RNA binding remains unclear. In the NMR structure of the L30e-mRNA complex, the exocyclic amine and N1 of A57 hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Asn47. This interaction was not specified by any intermolecular NOEs, but was observed due to proximity. This role for Asn47 was supported by its conservation among L30e sequences and biochemical data that showed an alanine substitution resulted in 27 fold reduction in binding (S. White, personal communication). Interestingly, this interaction was not found in the X-ray structure because Asn47 is involved in a crystal contact with a proline residue from the MBP fusion (Figure 6). In the X-ray structure, Asn74 replaces Asn47 in recognition of the A57 base. Asn74 is also highly conserved among L30e sequences, but there is no biochemical data concerning this residue. It is unclear if this differing interaction is some facet of L30e RNA recognition that was previously unappreciated or an artifact of crystallization. Joint NMR and X-Ray Refinement NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography are two powerful methods for obtaining atomic-resolution models of proteins and nucleic acids. The structural information provided by each technique, however, is fundamentally different. In X-ray diffraction patterns, each reflection results from the scattering from every atom in the asymmetric unit. Restraints derived from NMR

Structure 1172

NOE and J-coupling data contain information about the distance and dihedral angle between specific atoms in the molecule being studied. In principle, the global structural information provided by X-ray crystallography data and the local structural information from NMR data can be combined in a single structure determination. The use of NMR and X-ray data in a joint refinement has been explored previously. In the first instance, it was shown for interleukin-1 that a joint refinement was able to produce a model that had comparable geometry and crystallographic R factors to the structure that was solved using only X-ray diffraction data (Clore and Gronenborn, 1992). The few NMR restraints that were violated were interpreted as authentic differences between the crystal and solution structures. These violations were almost exclusively confined to the side chains located on the surface of the protein where such deviations are expected. A similar protocol was applied to the proteins BPTI, p53, and HU, and these studies likewise found that the NMR and X-ray data sets can be extremely consistent with the majority of the differences arising from spin diffusion and crystal packing (Miller et al., 1996; Raves et al., 2001; Schiffer et al., 1994). A joint refinement was also employed in the structure determination of the ribosomal protein L9 (Hoffman et al., 1996). In the X-ray structure of this protein, 40 residues at the N terminus of the protein were not well defined by the electron density. NMR data was used to properly align a sheet that was out of register in the X-ray structure. The NMR study showed that the N terminus was indeed ordered in solution and that the disorder seen in the X-ray structure was due to crystal packing. In this example, the joint NMR and X-ray refinement was able to produce a higher quality model of L9 than by X-ray data alone. The MBP-L30e-RNA complex is a prime candidate for refinement using both NMR and X-ray data. By NMR data alone, an accurate model of the L30e-mRNA com° plex could not be obtained. A 3.24 A structure of the MBP-L30e-RNA complex is at a modest resolution where the diffraction data could be complemented by NMR data to improve the overall model. While approximately 2/3 of the scattering mass is composed of the MBP protein, which the NMR data will not influence, the NMR data should aid in the structure determination of the L30e-RNA portion of the model. Weak electron density for the N- and C termini of L30e, several L30e side chains, and helix II of the RNA made modeling of these regions difficult. These regions in particular could be aided by the local structural information provided by the NMR data. The X-ray only model was used as the starting point ° for the joint NMR and X-ray refinement. The full 3.24 A diffraction data and the entire NMR derived distant and dihedral angle restraints were incorporated into one simulated annealing protocol within CNS (Table 1). The MBP coordinates were fixed during refinement in order to isolate the effect of the NMR restraints on the refinement statistics. 3|Fo| 2|Fc|, 2|Fo| |Fc|, and |Fo| |Fc| electron density maps were calculated and the model was manually inspected and rebuilt. NOE and dihedral angle violations were also examined and the model was

rebuilt accordingly. The use of the published NMR restraint set in the joint refinement structure calculation independently led to the identification of the mistaken G11 imino proton assignment, the incorrect position of G58, and the altered G10:U60 base pair. Both NOE violations, Fourier difference electron density, and distortions in molecular geometry clearly indicated that these positions were not consistent between the X-ray and NMR data sets (Figures 7A­7C). Distance restraints involving these protons were removed from the NMR data set used in the subsequent rounds of joint refinement. The use of this modified NMR restraint set resulted in an increase in both of the crystallographic R factors, indicating that the model was being affected by the NMR-based restraints, albeit in a negative way (Table 3). The increase in R factors can be primarily attributed to several NOEs that were violated during the joint refinement. Many of the NOE restraints that were violated by ° greater than 0.5 A were in regions of the protein that made crystal packing interactions. In particular, the packing of the third helix is altered because of crystal contacts to a symmetry-related MBP. Distance restraints involved in crystal contacts, 22 restraints in all, were removed from the restraint list used in the joint refinement. Whenever possible, NOE violations were also checked against the primary NMR data. The NOE between Ser29 HN and G58 H1 was found to be incorrectly assigned in a 15N NOESY-HSQC. The remaining NOE violations were used to guide the rebuilding of the model and were especially useful with the placement of side chain torsions that were ambiguous in electron density. Several of the aliphatic side chains in the protein core were rotated based upon NOE violations where stereospecific methyl assignments had been made. Two residues at the N terminus and seven residues at the C terminus were added to the model based upon improved electron density in these regions. Cycles of simulated annealing followed by inspection of electron density maps, and distance and dihedral angle violations were repeated until the R factors converged and the NOE energy term was minimized. The cycles of joint refinement continually improved the molecular geometry of the model as well as the R factors (Table 3). The final round of joint refinement had slightly lower Rfree and Rcryst than the X-ray only model, but showed a significant improvement in stereochemistry. This improvement in R factors was not solely due to the added residues because refinement of the final joint model using a truncated L30e (residues 11­98) results in only a marginal increase (Rfree 32.1 and Rcryst 26.1). The region of L30e that showed the greatest improvement in stereochemistry was located primarily in the first helix and the loop region from residues 93 to 99 where electron density was weak. Upon incorporation of the NMR data into the structure refinement, the / angles that populated the generously allowed and disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot were placed in more favorable regions. The structure of the RNA also improved upon incorporation of NMR-based restraints. Rmsds for all heavy atoms to ideal A-form geometry ° ° improve from 1.7 to 1.3 A for helix I and 2.4 to 1.5 A for helix II.

Effect of Erroneous NMR Restraints on Joint Refinement Joint refinement using the published NMR restraint set showed clear differences between the NMR and X-ray structures of the RNA internal loop. 2Fo Fc electron density contoured at 1 (blue) and Fo Fc difference density contoured at 3 (green) and 3 (red) are shown. (A) G10 and U60 incorrectly form a wobble pair after the first round of joint refinement. 3 difference density shows the position of the G:U amino-4-carbonyl base pair. (B) The position of the G11 base is rotated approximately 90 into 3 difference density after refinement. (C) The planarity of the G58 base is distorted by the refinement. This figure was generated with Xtalview and Raster3D (McRee, 1999; Merrit and Bacon, 1997).

Summary of Joint Refinement In most instances, complete sets of either NMR restraints or X-ray diffraction data are alone sufficient to accurately determine the structure of a macromolecule. In the case of the L30e-mRNA complex, NMR data alone was insufficient to calculate a correct structure of the RNP, and several regions of the L30e-mRNA complex ° were poorly defined by X-ray diffraction data at 3.24 A resolution. The joint refinement allowed us to utilize all of the available experimental structural data to determine the structure of the L30e-mRNA complex. The final model is remarkably consistent with both the X-ray and NMR data sets and benefits from the global and local structural information provided by each technique, respectively. The X-ray diffraction data allowed us to correctly model the structure of the RNA internal loop as a canonical K-turn fold, which was in error in the previous

NMR structure. The NMR-derived distance and angle restraints improved the overall quality of the model of the L30e-mRNA complex over the structure solved by X-ray diffraction data only. As macromolecular structures increase in both size and complexity, a complete view of the complex will become more difficult to obtain using a single structural technique. The synergy provided by joint X-ray and NMR refinement should have increased applicability as the field of structural biology focuses on more difficult targets of high biological significance.

exchange chromatography followed by amylose affinity chromatography. Synthetic RNA oligonucleotides used in the X-ray crystallography study were obtained from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO) and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 8 M urea. A more detailed description of the protein and RNA purification can be found elsewhere (Hoggan et al., 2003). Crystallization and Data Collection The initial crystals of MBP-L30e in complex with the pre-mRNA regulatory site were obtained by a combinatorial approach that systematically varied the lengths of the RNA helices. A detailed description of this method was published previously (Hoggan et al., 2003). MBP-L30e-RNA crystals were grown at 22 C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of the complex solution (10 mM potassium phosphate [pH 6.0], 1 mM maltose, 0.02% sodium azide) with the reservoir solution (1 M lithium sulfate, 0.05 M sodium cacodylate [pH 6.0], 0.01 M magnesium chloride, and 0.5% Jeffamine). Data were collected from a single crystal at 180 C in a cryoprotectant that consisted of the reservoir with 25% (w/v) glycerol at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory ° beamline 9-2 at a wavelength of 0.9795 A. The data were processed and scaled with MOSFLM and the CCP4 suite of programs (CCP4, 1994). The MBP-L30e-RNA complex crystallized in the space group ° P41212 with unit cell dimensions of a b 136.006 and c 123.813 A and contained one copy of the complex in the asymmetric unit. X-Ray Crystallography Structure Determination The structure of the MBP-L30e-RNA complex was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe using a previously determined structure of the MBP-L30e fusion protein (PDB accession number 1NMU) (Chao et al., 2003; Navaza, 2001). Using a resolution range between ° 30 and 4 A, the rotation function calculated one unambiguous solution with a correlation coefficient of 33.0 and the highest noise peak had a value of 31.4. The rotation solution was then subjected to a translational search and rigid body refinement resulting in an Rcryst 44.4 and a correlation coefficient of 58.7. A molecular replacement solution was also found using only MBP as a search model (PDB accession number 1ANF) (Quiocho et al., 1997). The NMR model of the L30e-RNA complex, however, did not yield a molecular replacement solution even after the MBP had been placed. Difference Fourier electron density maps clearly show the position of the phosphate backbone of the RNA in the complex. Initial rounds of model building and refinement were performed with Xtalview and CNS (Brunger et al., 1998; McRee, 1999). Difference Fourier, simulated annealing, and composite omit maps were used to build the model. Maltotetraose was found in the MBP ligand binding pocket as previously seen in the MBP-L30e structure determination (Chao et al., 2003). Analysis of Previous NMR Data When the L30e-mRNA complex was formed, new amino and imino resonances appeared in NMR spectra, indicating that the RNA internal loop had become more structured (Mao and Williamson, 1999a). New amino proton resonances from the guanosine and adenosine residues in the internal loop were observed upon complex formation, but they were too broad to be assigned (Mao, 1998). Two new guanosine imino proton resonances also appeared upon complex formation that belonged to two of the three guanosine residues in the internal loop (G11, G56, and G58). One of the guanosine imino resonances is shifted upfield (8.98 ppm) and gave several intermolecular NOEs to Phe85. Chemical shielding from stacking with Phe85 would explain the unusual imino proton chemical shift. Other intermolecular NOEs involving G56 sugar and base protons strongly suggested that the imino proton resonance at 8.98 ppm belonged to G56. Absence of the resonance at 8.98 ppm in NMR spectra of a G56A mutant complex confirmed this assignment (Mao and Williamson, 1999a). The second new imino proton resonance at 11.18 ppm was assigned to G11 based on an intraresidue NOE to G11 H1 and sequential NOEs to A12 H2 and H2 (Mao and Williamson, 1999a). The position of the G11 imino proton in the NMR structure is not consistent with its position in the X-ray structure. Since the assignment for this resonance was based on NOEs and not unambiguous through bond NMR experiments, we investigated the

possibility that the imino resonance at 11.18 ppm belonged to the other guanosine in the internal loop, G58. If the NOEs involving the imino resonance at 11.18 ppm are mapped onto the X-ray structure using the alternate G58 assignment, all four of the intermolecular NOEs and three of the five intramolecular NOEs to G56 H8, G56 H1 , and G11 H1 are satisfied. The NOEs from the G58 imino proton to A12 H2 and H2 are not consistent with the X-ray structure, since their interproton distances are ° greater than 8 A. The primary NMR data were reexamined for these two restraints. Examination of a 2D NOESY-Watergate spectrum previously recorded on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer with a 100 ms mixing time confirmed that the NOE from the imino proton at 11.18 ppm that was assigned to A12 H2 (7.84 ppm) was actually G11 H8 (8.00 ppm). This NOE reassignment is consistent with the positions of G11 H8 and G58 H1 in the X-ray structure, which are ° separated by 5.2 A. The NOE to A12 H2 (4.91 ppm) overlaps with the water resonance at 30 C and could not be unambiguously observed in either a 2D NOESY-Watergate or a 3D 15N NOESY-HSQC recorded previously. This analysis supports the reassignment of the imino proton resonance from G11 to G58. In summary, eight of the nine NOEs are consistent with the X-ray structure if the imino proton is reassigned to G58H1. Recalculation of NMR Structure A comparable structure refinement using CNS 1.1 and AMBER 7 instead of X-plor 3.1 and AMBER (Sander 5.1) was used to calculate the structure of the L30e-mRNA complex (Brunger et al., 1998; Pearlman et al., 1995). The initial protein and RNA structures were generated separately using the CNS anneal.inp script. A set of 100 protein structures were calculated from random coordinates and 100 RNA structures were calculated from A-form duplex. Combinations of the 20 lowest energy protein and RNA structures were then docked using CNS. The 100 lowest docked structures were subjected to a final refinement in AMBER7. The NMR structure calculations were performed with several different restraint sets. The first calculation was performed with the published restraints deposited with PDB id 1CN9; however, the convergence previously reported was not obtained (Mao et al., 1999). The published restraint set contained 11 NOE-based restraints that were not based on experimental NMR data, including the G:G reverse Hoogsteen base pair restraints and restraints involving G11 amino, G56 amino, G13 2 OH, and A55 2 OH protons that were not assigned in the BMRB (accession code 4345). The second restraint set used in structure calculations had these distance restraints removed and, consequently, it did not converge. The G:G reverse Hoosteen base pair distance restraints were shown to be the most crucial of the nonexperimental restraints. The third restraint set contained the G58 imino proton reassignment and properly adjusted NOEs, and this structure calculation showed poor convergence. A fourth restraint set added nonexperimental restraints for the two G:A sheared pairs (G11:A59 and A12:G58) to the third restraint set, and this structure calculation converged better than the published restraint set. Joint NMR and X-Ray Crystallography Structure Determination The joint NMR and X-ray refinement was performed using CNS version 1.1 (Brunger et al., 1998). Initial structure determination of the MBP-L30e-RNA complex was performed in the absence of NMRbased restraints and used the 18,636 reflections in the resolution ° range from 26 to 3.24 A. After the X-ray only structure calculation had converged, NMR-based restraints were then added to the refinement. The crystallographic simulated annealing and minimization scripts were then modified to incorporate NOE distance restraints and dihedral angle restraints into the standard CNS energy function. While it is not clear how to weigh the NMR and X-ray data sets with respect to each other, it is well understood how to weight each data set individually to the CNS energy function. The weighting for the X-ray reflections was calculated using the "getweight" module within CNS. The scale factors in the first slow-cool annealing stage of the NMR anneal.inp script were used for the distance (150) and dihedral angle (200) restraints, which are typical for NMR refinements. While the X-ray energy term was substantially larger than

Joint Refinement of L30e-mRNA Complex 1175

the NMR energy term, inspection of the model as well as an initial increase in Rfree clearly indicated that NMR-based restraints were affecting the refinement. Variations of these NMR scale factors were tested and it was found that increasing the scale factors did not have a dramatic effect on the refinement. Smaller scaling factors ( 50) for the experimental NMR restraints resulted in large number of NOE and dihedral violations. If larger scaling factors ( 400) were used in the refinement, distortions in the molecular geometry were observed. Rounds of refinement were followed by manual inspection of 3|Fo| 2|Fc|, 2|Fo| |Fc|, and |Fo| |Fc| electron density maps. Distance and dihedral angle violations were also tabulated and analyzed. Many of the NOEs that were violated were located on the face of L30e that makes several crystal contacts to a symmetryrelated MBP. These crystal contacts resulted in a slight reorganization of the packing of some side chains. NOEs that were violated because of crystal packing were removed from the NMR data set used in the joint refinement. The model was then rebuilt using both information from the electron density maps and the NOE and dihedral angle violations. Improvements in stereochemistry were calculated using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993).
