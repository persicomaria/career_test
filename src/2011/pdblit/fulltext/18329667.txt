Members of the LSm family of proteins share the Sm fold ­ a closed barrel comprising five anti-parallel b strands with an a helix stacked on the top. The fold forms a subunit of hexameric or heptameric rings of w7 nm in diameter. Interactions between neighboring subunits center on an anti-parallel interaction of the fourth and fifth b strands. In the lumen of the ring, the subunits have the same spacing as nucleotides in RNA, enabling the rings to bind to single-stranded RNA via a repeating motif. Eubacteria and archaea build homohexamers and homoheptamers, respectively, whereas eukaryotes use O18 LSm paralogs to build at least six different heteroheptameric rings. The four different rings in the nucleus that permanently bind small nuclear RNAs and function in pre-mRNA maturation are called Sm rings. The two different rings that transiently bind to RNAs and, thereby, assist in the degradation of mRNA in the cytoplasm and the maturation of a wide spectrum of RNAs in the nucleus are called LSm rings. The LSm and Sm ring The Sm group of proteins was named after Stephanie Smith, the first patient in which the systemic lupus erythematosus-associated anti-Sm autoimmune antibodies were identified [1].

protein subunits of the heteroheptameric Sm rings that permanently bind to small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in the cell nucleus. The proteins that make up the hexameric or heptameric rings that bind to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) are now recognized as members of a larger family of like-Sm (LSm) proteins. The major Sm ring in the mammalian cell nucleus is formed by the seven Sm proteins SmB, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, SmF and SmG; however, SmB is replaced by an alternatively spliced variant SmB 0 or by a different gene product, the SmN protein, in a tissue-specific manner [2] (Figure 1a). The four major snRNAs (U1, U2, U4 and U5) and several minor snRNA species each have an Sm-RNA-sequence motif in a single-stranded region of the snRNA that binds to an Sm ring. Together with several snRNA-specific proteins, the Sm ring and the snRNA form small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Five snRNPs function together in pre-mRNA splicing, during which the snRNA components base-pair both with each other and with conserved sequence motifs at and near the intron­exon junctions and remove an intron from pre-mRNA [3,4]. In addition to the Sm rings, there is a second pair of homologous heteroheptameric LSm rings in eukaryotic cells that transiently bind a wide spectrum of RNAs (Figure 1b). Their protein subunits are named LSm1­8

Figure 1. Model of Sm-ring assembly and of the LSm ring. (a) The heptameric Sm ring assembles from snRNA and a pre-assembled pentamer of D1D2FEG and a dimer of BD3. The RNA-free precursors associate with the pICLn chaperone protein. The position of pICln is hypothetical. The snRNA binds to the Sm ring with one nucleotide of the Sm-RNA sequence of AUUUxUG bound to each Sm protein as shown. Kinetic data suggest that the RNA binds to the pentamer first and the dimer then binds to close the ring. The position of the Sm proteins in the ring and the alternative paralogs that replace B, D1 and D2 in different Sm rings are shown. The positions of the b4 and b5 strands that interact between neighboring subunits are also noted. (b) The mode of RNA binding by the LSm ring is not known. The order of the subunits as deduced from homology to the Sm protein and the alternative LSm paralogs that exchange in different rings are shown [31]. Corresponding author: Zieve, G.W.

and the two rings differ by the exchange of the LSm1 and LSm8 subunits. The LSm1­7 ring functions during mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm and the LSm2­8 ring functions during general RNA maturation in the nucleus [5­7]. The seven (or six) protein subunits of the Sm- and LSm-rings all share a common fold, appropriately called the Sm fold. The entire family of ring subunits is called the LSm family (Pfam PFO1423, Interpro IPR001163). The LSm family is found in most living species (but apparently not the Cyanobacteria) and form hexameric or heptameric rings that bind ssRNA and function in RNA maturation and mRNA degradation. Here, we review the structure and function of the multiple ring complexes built by the LSm family of proteins. We also summarize the conserved sequence motifs that form the protein and RNA-binding domains of the Sm fold. The Sm fold and multimeric rings The LSm family of proteins all share the Sm fold. The Sm fold is a closed or oligonucleotide-binding (OB)-like barrel with a helix stacked on top, and forms a subunit of the hexameric or heptameric ring. The OB-like barrel of the fold comprises five anti-parallel b strands, the first and fifth of which are short and the second, third and fourth of which are longer and bent. A loop from strand b4 to strand b5 of the fold closes the barrel (Figure 2). The loops between strands b2 and b3 and between b4 and 5b face the lumen of the ring and form a nucleotide-binding pocket in the Sm ring. The a helix and b1, b2 and b3 strands are coded in one continuous sequence motif (Sm1) followed by a variable internal sequence. Strands b4 and b5 are coded in a second, shorter sequence motif (Sm2) immediately after the variable region [8] (Figure 3a). At least 86 amino acids, including the traditional 46 amino acids of the Sm1 and Sm2 motifs, are important for building the Sm fold (Figure 3a). The contact between the subunits in the ring centers on an anti-parallel interaction between the backbone of the second half of b4 (b4B) and b5. However, the a helix and other amino acids are also involved. In our sequence library of O130 Sm-ring subunits (www.path.sunysb.edu/gz), there are only five amino acid insertions or deletions in the Sm-fold domain and they occur in the loops between the strands. The individual paralogs are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes (Figure 3b). Most of the LSm proteins are small, 16 kDa or less, however, several LSm proteins have long terminal extensions that include protein motifs that interact with other proteins or RNAs. These include the SmB and SmN proteins, the LSm10 and LSm11 proteins that bind the U7 snRNA, LSm4 and the recently identified LSm12­16 proteins [9,10]. Ultrastructurally, the Sm ring has diameter of 7 nm with a 2-nm lumen and resembles a seven-bladed turbine. The crystal structures show that each blade of the turbine is an anti-parallel b sheet of eight short b strands, each of five amino acids, and is built from two adjacent subunits [11­15]. The first three b strands of a blade come from one subunit and the next five come from the opposite face of the adjacent subunit. The long b2, b3 and b4 strands of the Sm fold are strongly bent, often with a highly conserved

Each half strand (segments A and B in Figure 2) of the b2, b3 and b4 strands forms one segment of the blade, and b1 and b5 strands form the other two blades (Figure 2b). Crystal structures are available from three archaea homoheptameric rings (PDB codes: 1I8F, 1I4K and 1JBM), some with oligonucleotides or nucleotides bound, and the eukaryotic D3B (PDB code: 1D3B) and D1D2 dimers (PDB code: 1B34). All show similar backbone structures and inter-subunit contacts. Phylogeny of the Sm fold Because the Sm fold is found in all three branches of life, it is likely that LSm proteins existed in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). Approximately 60 motifs, many with RNA-binding activities, can be traced back to LUCA [16,17]. Shifts in the family of LSm proteins are correlated with several important branches in the phylogenic tree. The LSm protein in eubacteria (Hfq) lacks the internal variable loop and forms a smaller homohexamer ring that binds to a family of small RNAs that function in translational control by base pairing with untranslated regions in mRNAs [18]. In archaea, there are often two

Sm proteins ­ Sm1 and Sm2 ­ that form homoheptamers and occasionally rings of different sizes. The crenarchaeotes have an additional Sm protein, Sm3, which is a traditional Sm domain fused to a second domain by a flexible linker. The archaea rings bind to ssRNA, including RNAase P, suggesting a role in RNA processing [19]. The LSm paralogs in eukaryotes assemble into the two different heteroheptameric Sm- and LSm-ring families. One characteristic of heteroheptamers is that they reduce variation of ring size, which can occur in homogeneous rings. The ten Sm proteins build four different Sm rings and the eight well-characterized LSm proteins construct two different LSm rings by substitution of subunits [20]. The major, and most abundant, Sm ring in vertebrate cells ­ the SmD3BD1D2FEG Sm ring ­ binds to the major U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs, which assist in the splicing of the GT-AG introns, and the less abundant U11, U12, and U4atac snRNAs, which help splice the less common AT-AC introns. The Sm ring assembles on the highly conserved single-stranded Sm-RNA-sequence motif with a consensus sequence of AAUUUxUGG present in the snRNAs [21] (Figure 4). There are 2.5 ! 106 copies of this major Sm ring in proliferating human cells [22]. An alternatively spliced variant of SmB, SmB 0 , replaces the SmB subunit in a species- and tissue-specific manner, and the SmN protein replaces SmB in neural tissue and is implicated in alternative splice-site selection [2]. In the Sm ring that specifically binds to the U7 snRNA, the LSm10 and LSm11 proteins replace SmD1 and SmD2 [23]. This ring processes the 3 0 end of histone mRNA [24]. All available data suggest that the Sm rings, which assemble internally on their target snRNAs, are permanently associated after assembly. Genetic, biochemical and structural studies suggest the order of the subunits in the eukaryotic heteroheptameric Sm ring is: D3, B, D1, D2, F, E and G [21,25,26].

Unlike Sm rings, LSm rings can be found without RNA and it is likely that they assemble independently of their bound RNA [27]. They are at least 20-times less abundant than the Sm rings in mammalian cells. The two characterized LSm rings are in complexes that function in mRNA decay and RNA maturation, suggesting the LSm rings have a dynamic interaction with their bound RNAs. The LSm1­7 ring is found in large complexes in the cytoplasm

in conjunction with a mRNA-decapping enzyme and a 5 0 /3 0 exonuclease; the complexes have been named GW bodies or P bodies [5,28­30]. The LSm2­8 ring, in which LSm1 is replaced by LSm8, is found in the nucleus where it binds to the U6 snRNA and U8 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), which function in pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA processing, respectively [6,27,31]. It is also essential for the proper maturation of tRNAs and other polymerase-IIItranscribed RNAs, for which no catalytic RNA is required [7]. The LSm2­8 ring binds to an internal eight-nucleotide sequence in the third loop of the U8 snoRNA and is reported to bind to both an internal sequence and a terminal uridine-rich sequence in U6 snRNA [27,32]. All polymerase-III transcripts terminate with a UUU-OH, which is usually removed during maturation. Recent data suggest that both the RNA-binding protein La and the LSm rings might bind to this sequence motif and cooperate in the maturation of the RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III [7,33,34]. Recently, additional proteins with Sm-fold domains have been found using structural homology search algorithms [9,10]. Five additional families of proteins, named LSm12­16 were identified that share the Sm fold but are larger than the typical LSm subunits and have C-terminal extensions that include protein methyltransferase motifs and other motifs that interact with RNA. Human ataxin-2 and its yeast homolog PBP1 [poly(A)binding protein 1 (PAB1)-binding protein] have been found to be long proteins with an Sm domain embedded between C- and N-terminal extensions [10]. Although these proteins have not been identified in ring structures, they might be subunits in LSm rings with novel functions in the cytoplasm or nucleus. LSm proteins have also been identified with phylogentically restricted distributions, for example, Sm proteins that bind telomeric RNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [35] and Sm proteins that localize in germ granules in Caenorhabditis elegans [36]. A yeast-specific LSm9 subunit of unknown function has also been identified [20]. The similarity of the eukaryotic and archaeal LSm proteins suggests that the eukaryotic proteins evolved from a sevenfold duplication of an archaea gene followed by a second duplication of the entire set to build the two ring families. Individual genes have undergone additional duplications to generate the large LSm family (Figure 5). Because U6 ­ which is in an LSm ring ­ is the catalytic component of the spliceosome, it is likely that LSm is the earlier form of the ring. The LSm and Sm proteins show a pair-wise homology in their Sm domains, which suggests that the SmD3BD1D2FEG Sm ring is homologous to an LSm ring of LSm4123657 [26,31]. A sequence analysis (discussed later) supports the suggestion that the LSm rings have a more general RNA-binding motif and that the Sm rings represent a specialized and stably assembled form of the ring. RNA-binding activity The available crystal structures of archaea Sm rings assembled with nucleotides or oligonucleotides and the electron micrographs of eukaryotic Sm rings bound to RNA show RNA binding in the lumen of the Sm rings with

one nucleotide binding to each subunit of the ring [13,26]. However, two crystal structures show additional nucleotide-binding sites on the top of the ring (PDB codes: 1M8V and 1LNX). In the Sm-ring lumen, the bases of the bound nucleotides are held in a pocket created by two threeamino-acid motifs in the loop between strands b2B and 3bA, and between b4B and b5, which sit at the top of the inner circumference of the ring [13] (Figure 2). These motifs include one amino acid of the b strand and two amino acids in the loop. We call these motifs Knuckle I, located at positions designated K1, K2 and K3, and Knuckle II, located at positions K4, K5 and K6. The knuckle motifs have a consensus sequence of [His/Tyr]Met-Asn and Arg-Gly-Asp in the archaea LSm proteins and the eukaryotic Sm subunits, respectively. The base of the bound nucleotide is stacked between the histidine or tyrosine ring at K1 and the guanidino group of the arginine at K4. The amido group of the highly conserved asparagine at K3 at the base of the pocket hydrogen bonds to the base and the aspartic acid at K6 makes a backbone

hydrogen bond to the ribose group. The methionine at K5 points away from the nucleotide-binding site and interacts with the loops in the adjacent subunit [13]. Crosslinking of the Sm rings to their bound snRNA indicates that the first and third uridines in the snRNA are bound to the SmG and SmB subunit of the rings, respectively [21]. Correlation of this orientation of the SmRNA sequence with the structure of the Sm ring indicates that the heptameric Sm-RNA sequence AUUUxUG binds to the Sm ring with the adenosine nucleotide bound to the SmE subunit and wraps around the ring with the guanosine nucleotide bound to the SmF subunit [21,26] (Figure 4). The nucleotides bound to the SmE and SmF subunits where the RNA enters the ring are usually purines, and there is a general preference for uridines in the middle of the sequence. As discussed by Mura et al. [13], the Sm nucleotide-binding pocket prefers uridine but, with changes in the amino acids in the K1 or K4 positions, it has the flexibility to bind to other nucleotides. The mode of RNA binding to the LSm rings is not known. The LSm-ring subunits and the Sm rings have similar amino acid sequences in Knuckle II, Arg-Gly[Asp/Glu], however, seven of the eight well-characterized LSm proteins diverge from the [His/Tyr]-Met-Asn Sm consensus sequence in the Knuckle I. The LSm rings maintain the highly conserved asparagine residue at K3 but often substitute large hydrophobic residues at positions K1 and K2. No crystal structures are available for these sequence motifs; however, the lack of stacking interactions with the hydrophobic side chains suggests that these sequences might allow reversible binding of ribonucleotides and broader RNA-binding specificity. There is also no available crosslinking of RNA with LSm rings to enable the alignment of RNA sequences with the LSm subunits. The crystal structures of two LSm rings show nucleotides bound on the top surface of the Sm rings (PDB codes: 1M8V and 1LNX) and in the luminal pockets, which suggests that the LSm and Sm rings might also have multiple modes of RNA binding. Sm and LSm assembly Unlike the LSm rings, which assemble independently of their bound RNAs, the Sm class of snRNAs assembles permanently with their bound snRNAs. Newly synthesized Sm-class RNAs U1, U2, U4 and U5, and the less abundant U11, U12 and U4atac snRNAs, appear in the cytoplasm immediately after transcription where they assemble into Sm rings before returning permanently to the nucleus [2]. Newly synthesized snRNP proteins are present in large pools of pre-assembled precursor complexes in the cytoplasm and rapidly assemble with the newly synthesized snRNAs [37]. After assembly in mammalian cells, the 5 0 7-methylguanosine cap on the snRNA is hyper-methylated to 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG), the 3 0 end is trimmed, nucleotides are modified and the snRNP particle is imported to the Cajal bodies in the nucleus [2,38]. In the Cajal bodies, additional posttranscriptional modifications of the snRNPs occur before the particles enter the functional pools in the nucleoplasm [38,39]. Recent studies suggest in yeast the hypermethylation of the 5 0 cap of the snRNA occurs after the
www.sciencedirect.com

snRNP particles move into the nucleolar compartment of the nucleus [40]. Nothing is currently known about the assembly intermediates of the less-abundant LSm rings. The Sm proteins are found in three RNA-free precursor complexes in the cytoplasm associated with three major non-Sm proteins that assist in assembly. Studies that begun in amphibian oocytes and continued in mammalian cells identified the following: (i) a large pool of the SmD1D2FEG pentamer in association with the pICln protein (see later) sedimenting at 6S; (ii) the methylosome, which is a complex that includes SmD3, SmB, SmD1 and protein arginine methyltransferase-5 (PRMT5; see later) with pICln sedimenting at 20S; and (iii) the snRNP SmB protein with some SmD3 and pICln sedimenting at 2S­7S [37,41]. The complexes are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm with no obvious compartmentalization [42]. Kinetic studies indicate that the SmB, SmD1 and SmD3 proteins move between the 20S methylosome complex and the other complexes [37]. The Sm ring assembles by the SmD1D2FEG binding to the snRNA followed by the addition of the SmD3B dimer to finish the ring [43] (Figure 1). This suggests that the purines at both ends of the Sm-RNA sequence bind to the pentamer subunits and the RNA loops around the pentamer leaving a twonucleotide gap that is then bound by the SmD3B dimer. The nucleotides adjacent to the heptameric sequence that binds the Sm subunits are also conserved, and it is likely that they contact the ring subunits as they enter and leave the ring. The nuclear-localization sequence recognized by snurportin 1 includes the TMG cap of the snRNAs and the Sm ring [44]. The pICln protein interacts with all three of the RNA-free sub-core complexes in the cytoplasm but is absent from the mature snRNP particles [40,45,46]. This suggests that pICln acts as a chaperone for the sub-core complexes, possibly by interacting with the exposed subunit interfaces before they assemble into complete rings (Figure 1). pICln was first identified in Xenopus oocytes, which have a large pool of sub-core complexes, and was initially thought to affect chloride ion channels [47]. PRMT5 in the 20S methylosome is a type-II methyltransferase that generates the symmetric 0 u-NG,NG -dimethyl-arginine modification (sDMA) on arginine residues in the C-terminal tails of the SmD1, SmD3 and SmB snRNP proteins [46,48,49]. This rare posttranslational modification ­ which was first found on myelin basic protein, the major auto-antigen in multiple sclerosis ­ occurs on arginine residues embedded in ArgGly motifs [50]. Methylation has been suggested to reduce the affinity of the arginine side chain for RNA and enable a dynamic interaction between the amino acid and RNA [51,52]. The SMN (survival of motor neuron) complex includes the SMN protein and several associated proteins. This complex is found in the cytoplasm and nucleus where it assists in the assembly and storage of the snRNP and other RNP particles [52­54]. The SMN protein interacts directly with snRNA and with the Sm proteins via both the sDMA motifs and the Sm fold. It is suggested that the SMN complex functions as a scaffold to help bring the Sm proteins and the snRNA together during the assembly cycle [55].

Concluding remarks The heptameric and hexameric LSm and Sm rings have the appropriate dimensions to bind to ssRNA around lumen with one nucleotide per subunit. This enables the rings to use conserved motifs in the loops between strands and, possibly, other sites to build RNA-binding pockets. The Sm-fold motif emerged from LUCA and has evolved a diverse set of RNA-related functions in almost all living organisms. The rings function as scaffolds for ssRNA and function in the assembly, intracellular transport, and storage of both RNAs and RNA-associated complexes. In some contexts, the rings carry a catalytic RNA that functions in RNA processing or translational control; in other contexts, the LSm ring binds to substrate RNAs that are degraded or modified. Functions of the rings are often specified by the N- and C-terminal domains of the ring subunits that extend out from the ring and contain a variety of motifs capable of interacting with RNAs and proteins. The assembly of the rings in multi-ring complexes, such as spliceosomes and storage granules, suggests that the rings might have intrinsic abilities to interact with each other. Although extensively studied, the LSm family is still the focus of numerous unanswered questions. What determinants predispose the snRNP proteins to autoimmune recognition in humans? What are the roles of posttranslational modification? What are the assembly intermediates of the Sm and LSm rings, and how is assembly regulated? How are the specific inter-subunit contacts specified? What determines the specificity for the different modes of RNA binding? How do the rings interact with each other and other complexes? How are the rings disassembled and degraded? Combined phylogenic and biochemical approaches are currently investigating these questions.
