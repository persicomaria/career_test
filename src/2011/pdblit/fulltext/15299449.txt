The crystals of the enzyme containing the active-site-directed inhibitor, 3-deoxy-3fluoromethylene-D-glucose (DFMG), were prepared by placing crystals from the stock batch in a droplet of crystallization mother liquor containing the inhibitor at a concentration of - 2 m M along with both Mn 2+ and Mg 2+ at 2 mM. The crystals were allowed to soak in this manner at 277 K for 4 d before the diffraction data were collected. The X-ray diffraction data were measured at 285-287 or 277-279 K using the Nicolet/Xentronix (now Siemens) area detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating-anode generator using Ingersoll focusing nickel mirrors with Cu Ka radiation. The data were processed using the XENGEN software package (Howard, Gilliland, Finzel, Poulos, Ohlendorf & Salemme, 1987) or the XDS package (Kabsch, 1988a,b) to obtain structure amplitudes. Table 1 contains a summary of the results of the data collection and conditions for the crystals used in this study. In all cases, data were measured to a maximum resolution of 1.55/~, with the goal of obtaining at least 1.7 A resolution data that are nearly complete. In all cases, the data were truncated at the stated resolution (Table 1) since for that particular data set, the average intensity fell below 2~r(/).

Materials
The threonate used in this study was prepared and kindly provided by Dr Steven Seeholzer. The 3deoxy-3-fluoromethylene glucose was provided by Dr Jean-Francois Biellmann of the University of Strasbourg, France. Other materials used were reagent-grade chemicals from Sigma Company.

Experimental
Preparation of crystals and data collection
The crystals used in these studies were prepared from 0.2 ml solutions containing purified D-xylose isomerase at --25 m g m l m 0.76 M (NH4)2SO4. Crystals were grown at three different pH conditions, pH 7.4, 8.0 and 9.0 using 0.01 M PIPES buffer at pH 7.4, 0.01 M HEPES at pH 8.0 and 0.01 M CHES at pH 9.0. All stock solutions were prepared using the appropriate buffer for the particular pH condition. The solutions were refrigerated overnight at 277 K and crystals ranging up to - 2 m m in the largest dimension were grown. The crystals grown in this manner were used for all of the studies involving substrate, substrate analogues and inhibitors and other sugar analogs. In all cases, crystals for the diffraction experiments were prepared by placing crystals from the appropriate stock batch in a droplet containing the compound of interest. Where appropriate, the crystals were allowed to equilibrate

Refinement of structures
The native enzyme structure has been reported previously by this laboratory (Carrell et al., 1984, 1989) as well as by other investigators. The highresolution structure obtained in this laboratory is

H. L. CARRELL, HELGA HOIER AND JENNY P. GLUSKER virtually identical to the structure as published by Dauter and by Whitlow and their co-workers (Dauter, Terry, Witzel & Wilson, 1990; Whitlow et al., 1991). In our studies we have used the coordinates from our own studies including the 381 solvent molecules placed by us. In this case, the water molecules near the binding/substrate-binding sites are well characterized. The refinements were carried out using restrained least-squares refinement as described by Knossow, Lewis, Rees, Wilson, Skehel & Wiley (1986) utilizing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) acceleration of the process (Ten Eyck, 1977) using P R O L S Q (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980; Hendrickson, 1985). The refinements led to R factors

ranging between 0.131 and 0.15 for the structures. The general strategy for the crystals soaked in substrate or analog was to compute difference maps with all active-site solvent molecules and metal ions removed. The appropriate metal ions were then placed in the resulting electron-density map, as well as any clearly indicated solvent atoms and any indicated adjustments to positions of the side chains of the protein. This rebuilding of the model was carried out by use of the computer program F R O D O (Jones, 1985) with both Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc density maps. A refinement of the appropriate structure was then carried out, omitting the coordinates of ligand molecules. The bound ligand molecule was then

In all cases we checked the overall difference electron-density map for any other changes, including solvent molecules. The only changes observed were those occurring in or near the active site. The largest changes in atomic positions in the 'active' site occurred with the covalently bound inhibitor, 3-deoxyfluoromethyleneglucose. In all of the refinements, the results were virtually identical in terms of r.m.s, error. The r.m.s, errors for bond distances ranged from 0.019 to 0.025 ,~: 0.30-0.35/k for 1-3 (angle) distances and 0.45-0.60 A for 1-4

When 2deoxy-3-fluoroglucose was soaked into the crystals, a-D-glucose was also found in the electron-density map to be bound to the enzyme. This is, apparently, a non-enzymatic conversion; it was found to occur also in buffer in the absence of enzyme. Two electron-density maps were uninterpretable - those with bound sorbose and ribose.

D-XYLOSE ISOMERASE
Discussion

The binding is shown as a ball-and-stick view, drawn with the UNIX program I C R V I E W (Erlebacher & Carrell, 1992), and by line diagrams for clarity. Shown are: native enzyme (Fig. 1), D-xylose (Fig. 2), D-xylulose (Fig. 3), D-glucose (Fig. 4), D-xylitol (Fig. 5), D-sorbitol (Fig. 6), threonate (Fig. 7), L-ascorbic acid (Fig. 8), 1,5-dianhydrosorbitol (Fig. 9), and the alkylated enzyme (Fig. 10). Fig. l l(a) shows the 'omit' electron density for native + 1.5 M D-xylose (crystal 6). Fig. l l(b) shows the 'omit' density for native + D-xylulose (crystal 7, Table 1).

The mode of catalytic action of this enzyme is still under active investigation. Various possible mechanisms have been proposed (Fig. 12) and they include a cis ene diol intermediate with proton transfer and at least two mechanisms involving a hydride shift. The current work described here cannot be used to distinguish among these, but it demonstrates the many binding modes that this enzyme can accommodate. The role of His54 is still being debated. Originally it had been suggested by us (CarreU et al., 1989),

D-XYLOSE ISOMERASE

(1991) suggest that His54 may act as an acid-base catalyst by extracting a proton from Asp57 so that ND1 becomes protonated. His54 can then shuttle a proton between the O1 hydroxyl group and the ring O atom of a-o-xylose. Whitlow et al. (1991) envision a mechanism similar to that of Collyer & Blow (1990), in which M2 is the 'catalytic metal'. A water molecule that is hydrogen bonded to O1 and 02 of substrate, to OD1 of Asp25?, and coordinated to M2, transfers a proton to OD1 of Asp257. This leaves a metal-bound hydroxyl group which removes the 0 2 hydroxyl

proton from D-xylose. M2 then moves 1.76 A so that it can coordinate directly to O1 and 0 2 of the ligand, displacing the water carrying the 0 2 proton. The proton of o-xylose moves to the p r o - R position on C l to give o-xylulose by a 1,2-hydride shift. The metal-mediated hydride-shift mechanism was proposed because there did not seem to be as suitable base in the vicinity for proton abstraction and because the proton that is transferred between C1 and C2 does not exchange with solvent. In this proposed mechanism Trpl6 excludes solvent. The negative charge on 02 migrates to O1 during the hydride shift and the water donates a proton to O1. OD1 of Asp257 transfers a proton to the hydroxyl group. The product, o-xylulose, is then cyclized. The results we obtain are of interest in light of this proposed mechanism. There is no evidence that any of the compounds reported here by us are ever directly bonded to M2. This is different from the situation described by Lambeir et al. (1992) for the A. missouriensis enzyme in which M2 binds the C1 hydroxyl of D-xylitol. In the crystalline enzymeligand complexes we have studied there is always an intervening water molecule. Also, we always find the metal ion to be hexa-coordinated, unlike the findings of a lower coordination number by Jenkins et al. (1992). On the other hand, we find that the C l hydroxyl group of o-xylitol binds to the N atom of Lys183. Lambeir et al. (1992) point out that this may aid in stabilizing the binding of substrate in the open-chain conformation. They also suggest that the e-amino group of Lys183 may help polarize the C - - O bond of aldose substrates and lower the pK,, of the hydroxyl group of ketoses. The binding of substrates and their analogues has Glu 181 also been studied by other workers. Jenkins et al.

H. L. CARRELL, H E L G A HOIER A N D J E N N Y P. G L U S K E R that the metal is lost in the structures containing D-sorbitol (Fig. 6) and threonate (Fig. 7). Each metal ion is part of a motif that also involves a carboxyl group, and a water molecule, as illustrated in Table 3. The water molecule 409 (bound to M2), important in the metal-mediated hydride-shift mechanism, is not replaced by any of the ligands we have used. The water molecule, 609 (bound to M1), is always replaced as is water molecule 507 which is hydrogen bonded to water 409. Whitlow et al. (1991) point out that this M2-bound water molecule (409 in our numbering) can, together with Lys183, position the substrate so that the O 1 - - C 1 - - C 2 - - O 2 group is in the cis conformation (Schray & Rose, 1971). The enzyme moves the protons on 0 2 and C2 of D-xylose to O1 and C1 of D-xylulose. Our o-xylose binding electron-density map (Fig. l la) differs from that published by others. Collyer & Blow (1990) suggest that our electron density consists of a mixture of cyclic and extended forms of

121

D-xylose. We have tried, without success, to fit such models to our electron-density maps (1.6 and 1.7 A resolution) and conclude that we do not have such a mixture.

Concluding remarks
We have shown that the binding site of D-xylose from Streptomyces rubiginosis is fairly flexible and can accommodate substrate analogs in a variety of ways (summarized in Table 4). Some notable consistencies in most of the cases we present here are the role of the Ml-bound Glul81 carboxyl group in positioning what is generally 03 or 0 4 of the substrate (see Table 3), the binding of the e-amino group of Lys183 to the hydroxyl group on C1 in D-xylulose, D-xylitol and D-sorbitol, the role of water 409 which is not replaced by any of the compounds studied here, and the ever-present carboxyl group of Asp287 positioned over C3.

This analysis of the binding of substrates and inhibitors to D-xylose isomerase has led to the identification of three structural motifs (Fig. 14) (1) The metal ion may take part in a six-membered chelate ring by binding hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, or ring-ether O atoms. This motif is seen on binding o f xylose, xylulose, xylitol, sorbitol and threonate. (2) The metal ion may, alternatively, take part in a five-membered chelate ring, binding hydroxyl or ring-ether O atoms. This m o t i f is seen on binding o f

(3) The metal ion and a metal-bound hydroxyl group may bind both O atoms o f the side-chain carboxyl group o f G l u l 8 1 . This motif requires for mation o f two metal ion.--oxygen bonds and one hydrogen bond. It is found in all structures reported here. In this way the enzyme assures the binding o f a hydroxyl group at at least one of the two possible metal-binding positions and may, in this way, serve to control its pK value. (4) In all crystal structures reported here Asp287 lies above the C - - C portion o f the metal chelate rings.

(5) In no case is there direct binding of metal M2 to any atom in any of the liganding compounds described in this work. From the studies reported here it has become clear that further investigation of the role of Asp287 in the catalytic action of the enzyme is necessary. We thank Drs Steven Seeholzer and Jean-Francois Biellmann for compounds used in this study. The work was supported mainly by a grant GM-44360 from the National Institutes of Health, also by grants CA-10925 and CA-06927 from the National Institutes of Health, by an appropriation from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and by grant Ste-230 from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.
