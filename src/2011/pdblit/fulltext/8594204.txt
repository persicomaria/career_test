Department of Biotechnology Institute of Medical Biology MH-building, University of Tromso, 9037 Tromso   Norway By expressing a mutant trpR gene in an Escherichia coli strain that is trpR- and has b-galactosidase activity fused to the trp promotor/operator, thus putting the b-galactosidase activity under the control of the Trp repressor, we can determine quantitatively the relative repression activity of such mutant(s). We used this technique to analyse the biological consequences of substituting certain amino acid residues in only one of the two corepressor binding pockets. By combining two compatible plasmids in this strain, one expressing the mutant T44M and the other expressing only one substitution at a time at position 85, we analysed the repression activity of the resulting interactions in vivo. This approach allowed us to engineer active dimer repressors made of two inactive or partially active monomers. Amino acid substitutions at position 85 with a positive or with an indole ring (W) appeared to complement T44M, while amino acids with a negative charge did not. Only L substitution at position 85 appeared to restore activity among the hydrophobic amino acids tested. Similar to the wild-type repressor activity, the successful mutant­mutant interactions were L-tryptophan dependent. In vivo regulation by three known L-tryptophan analogues demonstrated the same trend of regulation among the wild-type repressors and the active mutant­mutant combinations.

Introduction
Despite the fact that the function of a protein depends on its primary and subsequently tertiary/ quaternary structure, the mechanisms for protein structure­function relationships are not fully understood. However, powerful technology such as NMR and X-ray crystallography, in combination with genetic manipulation or chemical peptide synthesis, has provided useful information about this relationship. Random or site-specific amino acid substitutions have been demonstrated to give altered, additional or novel protein functions (Sutton et al., 1993; Ebright et al., 1990; Sandberg & Terwilliger, 1993).

The Trp repressor protein is a dimer of two identical 107 amino acid polypeptides (Gunsalus & Yanofsky, 1980), involved in the transcriptional regulation of five unlinked operator regions: trpEDCBA, aroH, trpR, aroL (Gunsalus & Yanofsky, 1980; Grove & Gunsalus, 1987; Heatwole & Somerville, 1992) and mtr (Heatwole & Somerville, 1991; Sarsero et al., 1991). The trp repressor sequence is highly conserved among enteric bacteria (Arvidson et al., 1994). Each polypeptide consists of six a-helices connected by short turns. The crystal structures of the holorepressor (Schevitz et al. 1985), the aporepressor (Zhang et al., 1987) and the repressor/operator complex (Otwinowski et al., 1988) show that the Trp repressor has a rigid hydrophobic core (a-helices A, B, C and F) and two similar flexible ``DNA reading heads'' containing the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs (a-helices D and E). Two hydrophobic corepressor binding pockets, formed by amino acids from both subunits, are located on each side of the central core, wedged between the core and the flexible DNA

890 reading heads. Binding of two molecules of corepressor L-tryptophan alters the orientation of the recognition helices, thereby enabling specific interaction with the operator. Crystal structures of the TrpR/operator complex (Otwinowski et al., 1988), as well as mutagenesis studies (Joachimiak et al., 1994), have indicated a water mediated recognition between repressor and operator. A recent crystal structure of Trp repressors tandemly bound in a 2:1 complex with a central trp operator half-site (Lawson & Carey, 1993) also shows water mediated contact between the Trp repressor and its trp operator. A large number of L-tryptophan analogues have been characterized (Marmorstein et al., 1987; Lawson & Sigler, 1988; Marmorstein & Sigler, 1989). Indole analogues compete with L-tryptophan for binding of the Trp repressor but the resultant holorepressor is unable to bind operator DNA (Marmorstein & Sigler, 1989). L-tryptophan analogues 5-methyl tryptophan, 5-methyl tryptamine and L-abrine have been shown to behave as corepressors in vitro (Marmorstein et al., 1987; Arvidson et al., 1991). Identification of the residues involved in corepressor and DNA binding (Arvidson et al., 1993; Chou & Matthews, 1989; Klig et al., 1988; Graddis et al., 1988; Bass et al., 1988; Kelley & Yanofsky, 1985; He & Matthews, 1990) have shown that in the wild-type, Gly85 (G85) is not directly involved in corepressor binding, although the position seems important for Trp repressor activity (Luisi & Sigler, 1990; Komeiji et al., 1994). The corresponding position in most other repressors is occupied by a bulky residue, often W (Pabo & Sauer, 1992, 1984). The major role of G85 is most probably to provide space for L-tryptophan to bind (Marmorstein et al., 1987; Komeiji et al., 1994). In vitro heterodimer formation using extreme conditions has been described (Graddis et al., 1988), as well as an in vitro transcription/translation system (Hurlburt & Yanofsky, 1993). In vivo heterodimer formation between trpR mutants was described by Kelley & Yanofsky (1985) using negative complementation and also using in vivo intragenic complementation as described by Storbakk et al. (1992). Here we report the biological activities of six new trpR repressor mutants in addition to the four mutants previously studied (Storbakk et al., 1992). Substitutions at position 85 were used in combination with the defective trpR T44M in vivo. Both position G85 and T44 are located in the corepressor binding pocket, but only T44 interacts directly with the corepressor through a hydrogen bond to the a-carboxyl group on L-tryptophan (Zhang et al., 1987). The above combinations were expressed in compatible plasmids using the tet promoter of each of the two combined plasmid vectors. The mutant combinations were tested with two different b-galactosidase substrates as well as in the presence of L-tryptophan, 5-methyl tryptophan, 5-methyl tryptamine and L-abrine.

Results
Intragenic complementation and mutant­mutant interaction were used to analyse the interaction between different amino acid substitutions at position G85 with T44M in vivo (Figure 1). This was done by expressing a repressor with a mutation at position 85 using the tet promoter of pBR322, while T44M was expressed using the tet promoter in the compatible plasmid pACYC184 and double antibiotic selection (ampicillin and chloramphenicol). Four such mutants were analysed earlier (Storbakk et al., 1992). Six new Escherichia coli trpR repressor mutants with substitutions at position 85 in the corepressor binding pocket were constructed, and the repressor activities of these mutants were measured in terms of their ability to repress the b-galactosidase (b-gal) activity of the trp-lacZ fusion, strain CY15075 (R-lTLF; Yanofsky & Horn, 1981). Figure 2 presents the b-gal activity of Trp repressor mutants with different substitutions at position 85 (D, E, F, H, K, L, R, V, W and Y). All amino acid substitutions at position 85 resulted in mutant Trp repressors with either less activity than that of the wild-type TRP repressor (WT), or virtually no activity. The repressor activities of G85 substitution mutants (D, E, F, H, K, L, R, V, W and Y) were unaffected by the presence of the corepressor in the media.

When G85 mutants were expressed in the TrpR homodimers containing hydrophobic amino acid substitutions, only G85L demonstrated weak, but significant repressor activity, while both G85V and G85F were defective (Figure 2). The two mutant trp repressors with polar acidic amino acids (G85D and G85E) lost repressor activity. G85R with a basic amino acid substitution demonstrated the same level of repressor activity as G85L, while G85H and G85K (both with basic G85 substitutions) showed no repressor activity as homodimers. The highest repressor activity among the mutant homodimers was observed when the aromatic amino acids G85Y or G85W substituted G85.

Simultaneous expression of the T44M allele with each of the different G85 mutant substitutions can produce heterodimers carrying one wild-type and one mutant corepressor binding pocket. In Figure 3, the repressor activities of the mutant Trp repressors as heterodimers are shown. Trp repressor mutants G85L, G85R and G85W showed repressor activities comparable to that of the WT and such activities were L-tryptophan dependent. trpR mutants (G85F, G85H, G85K and G85V) showed little repression as homodimers, but showed dramatically increased repression when they were expressed together with the T44M homodimer in vivo. Only G85H and G85K demonstrated L-tryptophan dependent activities in

T44M (heterodimer), responded similarly to all the corepressors used (5-methyl tryptophan, L-tryptophan, abrine and 5-methyl tryptanine; Figure 4). Chi square contingency analysis indicates that no relationship/dependence exists between the regulatable mutant heterodimers and the corepressors used (Table 2). Among the possible heterodimers (T44M/G85H, W, L, R, K or WT; G85), the WT (G85) accounted for the greatest deviation. Among the corepressors used (5-methyl tryptophan, L-tryptophan, abrine and 5methyl tryptamine), abrine accounted for the largest addition to the total Chi square values (Table 2). In all b-gal determinations, the chlorophenolredb-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG) substrate gave values that were largely consistent when the ortho-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) substrate was used.

these combinations of experiments. No repressor activity was observed when G85D or G85E was combined with T44M. G85Y exhibited less repressor activity as heterodimer (with T44M) than as a G85Y homodimer. b-gal activity correlated significantly with the isoelectric point of the amino acid substitutions at position 85 (Table 1). Among the corepressors used (L-tryptophan and its analogues), 5-methyl tryptophan produced the lowest b-gal activity followed by abrine, L-tryptophan and 5-methyl tryptamine. This pattern of b-gal activity in the presence of a given corepressor (5-methyl tryptophan < abrine < L-tryptophan < 5methyl tryptamine) remained consistent from WT to the other corepressor dependent TrpR heterodimer mutant combinations (R, W, H, K and L; Figure 4). All cases that exhibited L-tryptophan independence, whether expressed as a single mutation (homodimer) or in combination with

Discussion
None of the presented substitutions at position 85 can potentially disturb helix E, according to the structural basis of a helix propensity (Blaber et al., 1993). In fact, many of the amino acid substitutions at position 85 (D, E, H, L, K and Y), have an even higher a helix propensity than G in the wild-type repressor. These substitutions at position 85 are suggested to occupy space per se, or to interfere with the stereochemistry of the R84 side-chain, thereby reducing the efficiency of anchoring of the corepressor. A recent study by Komeiji et al. (1994) with the help of both experimental and computational data showed that substitutions at the 85 position void the affinity of the pocket for corepressor. The T44M mutant was defective and was found to be negatively complementing to the WT when T44M

was expressed from a plasmid and the WT allele was expressed from the chromosomal locus (Kelley & Yanofsky, 1985). However, when the different G85 mutant repressors were combined in vivo with T44M, the resulting interactions demonstrated a wide range of repressor activities. The observed activity for G85/T44M in the plasmid encoded combination would be mainly due to the wild-type repressor homodimers competing with the less active heterodimer repressors for binding to the trp promoter/operator. When G85 mutant repressors were expressed in vivo in combination with T44M, theoretically the ratio between homodimer:heterodimer:homodimer was 1:2:1, providing that the level of subunit expression is the same. Although only 50% of the potential dimers are heterodimers, positive complementation between T44M combined with certain G85 mutants was observed. Positively charged amino acids at position 85 complemented T44M, while negatively charged substitutions did not. We suggest that the relationship between isoelectric point (Lehringer et al., 1992) and b-gal activity (Table 1) partly accounts for this. The corepressor binds between a negative dipole created by the B helix and the negative DNA phosphate backbone. The key role of L-tryptophan as a corepressor could be to dissipate the tension created by the negative dipole of the B helix and the negative DNA phosphate backbone, creating a better binding situation (Marmorstein & Sigler, 1989). L-Tryptophan analogues that lack an amino group such as indole acrylic acid, a derepressor, bind in the reverse orientation compared to L-tryptophan (Borden et al., 1991; Lawson & Sigler, 1988), pointing to the importance of the placement of the amino group and indole nitrogen of L-tryptophan. Therefore, by introducing amino acids carrying a positive charge (or indole nitrogen) into the same area between the negative DNA backbone and the negative dipole of the B helix, we could create a more favourable binding situation. This theory could help explain the observed difference between W (indole nitrogen) and Y (hydroxy). However, all the results cannot be explained only in terms of charge. The difference between V and L, for example, is one carbon atom,

yet they behave differently in heterodimers, indicating that the size and the conformation of the amino acid residue can also be critical in determining affinity. The G85L method of action in the heterodimer could be to reorient other side groups into positions favourable for DNA binding, for example R84 or R54. It should also be noted that the DE region is characterized as being far more flexible in solution than previously thought (Arrowsmith et al., 1991; Zhao et al., 1993). Such a flexibility of the corepressor pocket could allow for a wide spectrum of possible functional configurations. The consistent pattern of corepression by Ltryptophan and its analogues (Figure 4) suggests that it is the presence of the wild-type pocket that induces corepressor/DNA specificity. However, the mutant pocket most likely affects the global binding of the repressor to the operator. In the absence of crystal structure we could not verify if this binding is due to the wild-type binding pocket or to the mutant pocket in the possible heterodimers.

Materials and Methods
Vectors and Escherichia coli strains The wild-type trpR gene cloned in the BamHI site of M13mp11 (Kelley & Yanofsky, 1985) was used for site-directed mutagenesis. Alternatively, G85R in M13mp18 was used as a template. The E. coli strain RZ1032 (ung-dut-; Kunkel et al., 1987) was used to prepare uracil-containing template. After mutagenesis, pACYC184 (Chang & Cohen, 1978) was used for subcloning of the mutant trpR in BamHI site. E. coli strain DH5aMCRTM (Gibco BRL, 1992) was used for plasmid maintenance. R- strain CY15075 (1TLF; Yanofsky & Horn, 1981) was used for testing the biological activities of the mutant repressors. Site-directed mutagenesis and DNA sequence analysis Site-directed mutagenesis in trpR was performed as previously described (Storbakk et al., 1992; Su & El-Gewely, 1988). Propagation of turbid plaques and isolation of single-stranded (ss) DNA for sequencing were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (1989).

(e420 13,000; Boehringer Mannheim, 1994) and CPRG (e574 75,000; Boehringer Mannheim, 1994). Correction was made for the length of the light path in the microplate reader. Absorbance of cells was measured at 590 nm instead of 600 nm, but this was corrected for. The assay was done in four parallels. CPRG proved much too fast when dealing with mutants expressing high b-gal activity. However, when dealing with mutants that show near wild-type repression ability, CPRG is three to four times more sensitive and twenty-five times faster than ONPG.

DNA sequencing DNA sequencing analysis was performed according to Sanger et al. (1977). Subcloning and trpR expression The trpR alleles were subcloned into the BamHI site of pACYC184 to give constitutive production of trpR from the tetracycline promoter (Kelley & Yanofsky, 1982). Mutant dsM13mp11-trpR DNA was isolated using the Magic MiniPreps System (ProMega Corp., Madison, WI) and the trpR fragments were released by BamHI (Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden) digestion. Fragments and vector were eluted from agarose gels as described by Weichenhan (1991) and subcloning proceeded following standard procedures. Competent DH5aMCRTM cells were prepared as described by Inoue et al. (1990) and, following transformation, tetracycline sensitive colonies were selected and examined for trpR inserts by gel electrophoresis. The orientation of the trpR fragment was verified by restriction enzyme analysis with SalI. CY 15075 cells were transformed with the mutant constructs for expression of mutant repressors as described previously (Storbakk et al., 1992). CY 15075 cells containing the mutant trpR allele T44M cloned into the BamHI site of pBR322 (Bolivar et al., 1977) were also co-transformed with pACYC184 containing different trpR mutant alleles. Double antibiotic selection with ampicillin and chloramphenicol was used to maintain the two plasmids. b-Galactosidase assay b-Gal assay was performed according to Miller (1972). Cells were grown in minimal media (Vogel & Bonner, 1956) with and without L-tryptophan (20 mg/ml), L-abrine (20 mg/ml), 5-methyl tryptamine (20 mg/ml), 5-methyl tryptophan (20 mg/ml; to offset the toxic affects of 5-methyl tryptophan, 1 mg/ml of tryptophan was added to the solution). A 200 ml mixture of cells and modified Z-buffer (0.1 M phosphate-buffer (pH 7.3), 6 mM MgCl2·6H2 O, 30 mM DTT, 0.15% (w/v) hexadecyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB), 4 mg/ml ONPG) or (0.1 M phosphate-buffer (pH 8.0), 6 mM MgCl2·6H2 O, 30 mM DTT, 0.15% (w/v) CTAB, 1 mM CPRG) was incubated at 30°C and b-gal activity was measured at 405 nm for ONPG and 560 nm for CPRG with Molecular Devices Vax microplate reader (Falcon 96-well flat-bottomed). The raw data were transferred to an IBM compatible PC and displayed graphically. Slopes were calculated using a minimum of ten points from the statistically most linear section of the graph. A small visual basic program was written to display and facilitate the dymamic exchange of data between various statistical programs. b-Gal activity was calculated according to the Lambert law using the extinction coefficient of ONPG
