Abstract The interactions of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) with model MgO and CaO surfaces have been investigated using density functional (DFT) and Møller­Plesset second order perturbation techniques. The geometries were fully optimized at the DFT level. The calculated interaction energies and the corresponding thermodynamic properties show that DFP is physisorbed on these two model oxide surfaces and adsorption on the MgO surface is stronger. Analyses of the calculated IR and Raman spectra point to the enhancement of the P@O stretching mode with respect to the isolated DFP and this property could be used to detect nerve-agents using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

1. Introduction Highly reactive organophosphate compounds such as sarin, soman, tabun and diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) are powerful inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AchE), which is critical in nerve function [1]. The interruption of this enzyme has rapid and fatal consequences to living organisms and is the basis of chemical weapons known as nerve-agents (NAs). Despite several decades of research [2­13], there is a continued need to find new and improved methods of detection and destruction of such highly toxic species. Alkaline earth metal oxides (MgO and CaO) [10,11] and several transition and non-transition metal oxides (e.g., TiO2 and Al2O3) [12,13] have been used to study the adsorption and dissociation of NAs. Although the adsorption of several NAs on such surfaces have been monitored through vibrational spectroscopy, similar theoretical studies are scarce because of the limitations to optimize such interactions on surfaces using quantum chemical

techniques. Moreover, since the P@O bond of the NAs have characteristic frequencies both in IR and Raman spectra, systematic theoretical analyses are needed to find whether such characteristics could be used for the detection of NAs. Experimentalists have used DFP as a model NA [6,14] to study their adsorption on metal oxides and to develop materials for NA detection based on fluorescence, as it lacks the proper efficiency of a NA. In recent times, adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of this molecule has been studied over nanosized TiO2 using diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (IR) spectroscopy [13]. The experimental data revealed that the adsorbed P@O stretching mode is at 1250 cmÀ1 with measurable intensity. Earlier theoretical studies of sarin and tabun with small CaO and MgO clusters revealed that they could be adsorbed on these oxides through interactions with their P@O oxygen [15,16]. Since these adsorption studies were carried out using fixed oxide geometry, the inferences drawn from such studies were qualitative in nature and the vibrational analyses of adsorption or thermodynamic characteristics of such binding were not available. Thus theoretical interaction studies

of NAs with such surfaces through complete geometry optimization are of paramount importance to understand the nature and vibrational characteristics of such interactions. In the present Letter, we have studied the adsorption of DFP on CaO and MgO surfaces through explicit optimization of the interacting systems since the calculated results of such interactions could be compared with experiment. The oxide structures chosen are large enough to consider these metal oxidesÁ Á ÁDFP interactions as a surface phenomenon, and the vibrational calculations carried out on such complexes would be reliable for comparison with experiments. Both IR and Raman spectra of the interacting systems have been calculated, and results are used to address a basic question of whether adsorption of NAs on such oxide surfaces could be profitably used for NA detection. 2. Methods of computation Both CaO and MgO form face-centered cubic crystal structures like NaCl. A two-layer cluster of the oxides (M16O16, M = Ca or Mg) was designed from their respective crystal structures, where each layer contains eight metal (Ca or Mg) and eight oxygen atoms. The cluster thus resembles a (0 0 1) surface. Molecular adsorption of DFP was investigated on these surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) [17]. A hybrid functional, which utilizes Becke's three-parameter functional [18] together with the local correlation part by Vosko et al. [19], and the nonlocal part by Lee et al. [20] (in short B3LYP), is used in the present calculations. The LANL2DZ basis set [21] was chosen for such calculations, and all of the atoms (except H) were further augmented with Dunning's dpolarization function [22,23]. The simulated oxide clusters, DFP and the M16O16Á Á Á DFP (M = Ca or Mg) complexes were fully optimized and the minimum energy structures were ascertained through frequency calculations (absence of any imaginary frequency). Both infrared (IR) and Raman spectra for

the optimized systems were calculated to investigate the effect of adsorption on the P@O stretching mode. The nature of the interactions was investigated through the interaction energy (DEint) calculations between the interacting components. Møller­Plesset second order perturbation (MP2) [24] and Hartree­Fock (HF) calculations were carried out on the optimized structures (at the DFT/B3LYP level) to estimate the contribution of dispersion and higher ð2Þ order correlation ðeMP Þ effects in such interactions [25]. The HF interaction energies were further analyzed to estimate ð10Þ the contributions of electrostatic ðeel Þ, Heitler­London exchange ðeHL Þ, and higher order delocalization ðDEHF Þ ex del ð10Þ energy terms to the total interactions ðDEint ðHFÞ ¼ eel þ eHL þ DEHF Þ [26]. del ex The thermodynamic parameters related to these adsorption processes were calculated (DFT/B3LYP level) using statistical mechanics expressions utilizing the ideal gas, rigid rotator, and harmonic oscillator approximations [27]. Basis set superposition error (BSSE) [28] corrections were included in all of the interaction energy terms and the related thermodynamic parameters. The calculations were carried out using GAUSSIAN 03 [29] and modified GAMESS code (for interaction energy partitioning) [30]. The molecular graphics were generated using GAUSS VIEW software [31]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Nature of adsorption of DFP on M16O16 (M = Mg, Ca) Fig. 1 shows the structures of the fully optimized M16O16Á Á ÁDFP (M = Mg, Ca) complexes at the DFT/ B3LYP level. The complexes were optimized under C1 symmetry, and as a result the oxide surfaces show slight deformations from the fully symmetric (0 0 1) surfaces. These deformations are not large, as can be seen from the respective figures and Table 1. The results of energy calculations are presented in Table 2. The optimized structures indicate

that DFP interacts with the metal centers of the oxide surfaces (Mg/Ca) through the oxygen of its P@O bond [32]. The weak interaction energies (DEint) characterize this process as slightly stronger than physisorption, and DFP is adsorbed more strongly on Mg16O16. The calculated DEint at the MP2 level also follows the same trend (Table 2). The MP2 level calculations also facilitated the estimation of the ð2Þ correlation contributions (eMP , equivalent to dispersion energy) and the results show that it constitutes almost 25% of the total interaction in the Ca16O16Á Á ÁDFP complex, and much less ($4.5%) in the Mg16O16Á Á ÁDFP comð2Þ plex. Since the contribution of eMP is small in these complexes, the DFT/B3LYP optimized structures could be trusted in our present investigations. The partitioned HF interaction energies in Table 2 further shows that the attractive contributions in both of the complexes are due to electrostatic and delocalization contributions which are offset by the repulsive Heitler­London exchange contribu-

tions. The larger difference ($10 kcal/mol) of delocalization energy contributions between the Mg16O16Á Á ÁDFP and Ca16O16Á Á ÁDFP complexes actually generates stronger interaction in the former case. Table 2 also contains the calculated thermodynamic parameters (viz., change of enthalpy, DH and change of Gibb's free energy, DG) and dissociation energies (D0) of the interacting systems, and they also follow the same trend of DEint values of the two complexes. The structures of M16O16 (M = Mg, Ca) and DFP were fully optimized to calculate these parameters. Ca16O16 could be fully optimized without any imaginary frequency under symmetry restrictions (D2d), but for Mg16O16 we had to relax the symmetry restrictions to C1 to generate the optimized structure with all real frequencies. The calculated average M­M (M = Mg/Ca) and M­O bond distances in the optimized structure deviate marginally from those in the standard crystal structure (Table 1), and the calculated dipole moments in both of these cases are either zero or very close to zero. Since in the optimized M16O16Á Á ÁDFP (M = Mg, Ca) clusters, the M­M and M­O distances remain almost unchanged with respect to the optimized M16O16 clusters, we can consider the clusters as model of adsorption of DFP on the MO (M = Mg, Ca) surfaces. 3.2.

to the Mg16O16 (M = Mg, Ca) torsions coupled with several torsional modes of DFP. Actually the contributions from DFP in such modes are very weak as our calculations showed that the free oxides have similar frequencies of almost identical intensities. There are three other important modes between 800 and 1600 cmÀ1. These vibrational modes are related to DFP (Fig. 2), and among them only the P@O stretching mode in Ca16O16Á Á ÁDFP complex is blue shifted with respect to that of Mg16O16Á Á ÁDFP. This effect is due to the stronger interaction of P@O bond with Mg16O16, which in turn slightly elongates the P@O distance ° (1.480 A) with respect to that in the Ca16O16Á Á ÁDFP com-

2000 cmÀ1 are very weak and their intensities do not change with respect to the isolated DFP molecule, and thus they are not useful for detection purpose. The recent IR spectroscopic studies of DFP adsorption on nanosized rutile TiO2 surface [12] have shown that the most of the important peaks lies between 900 and 3000 cmÀ1. The peaks between 1500 and 3000 cmÀ1, on the other hand are very weak, and this justifies our focus on the vibrational spectra within a limited region. The calculated IR frequencies show (Fig. 2) that between 200 and 700 cmÀ1, there are several strong peaks in both of the oxideÁ Á ÁDFP complexes. They are related

° plex (1.473 A). Thus the vibrational modes within 800 and À1 1600 cm need to be investigated in more detail to draw any conclusion regarding the utility of such peaks for detection of NAs. Figs. 3 and 4 represent the calculated IR and Raman spectra within the range of 900 and 1700 cmÀ1 for the Mg16O16Á Á ÁDFP and Ca16O16Á Á ÁDFP complexes, respectively. The calculated spectra of the isolated DFP are shown in these figures with dotted lines. The Raman spectra of both of the complexes show that the C­H bending modes of DFP (around 1400 and 1500 cmÀ1), which are too weak in the IR spectra (Figs. 3A and 4A) have appreciable intensity in the corresponding Raman spectra (Figs. 3B and 4B). The spectra of both of these complexes further

reveal that except for the P@O stretching mode, all other modes show insignificant variation of intensity with respect to those of the isolated DFP. This is quite expected, since in these complexes only the oxygen of P@O interacts with the model oxide surface. The intensities of the P@O stretching mode in the complexes reveal an important characteristic. As it could be seen from the respective spectra, the IR intensity of this mode is doubled with respect to the isolated DFP molecule, and in the Raman spectra the intensity of this mode is almost 10 times stronger. Although this intensity change (with respect to isolated DFP) for both of the complexes is more or less similar, the intensity of the P@O stretching mode is stronger when DFP forms a complex with Ca16O16. Thus nature of the surface is very important here as it is responsible for the enhancement of the P@O stretching mode intensity in the Raman spectra. The observed enhancement of P@O intensity here is probably due to enhancement of electric field provided by the surface. The charge-transfer mechanism, which is sometimes considered as an alternative to the electric field enhancement effect, is not important here, as interactions are weak and the charge transfer between the oxide surface and the adsorbate is negligible. In recent times, several devices have been proposed based on the change of fluorescence properties of materials through reaction with NAs or adsorption of these NAs on nanomaterial surfaces (especially Ag) and monitoring the Raman spectra [5­9]. The present calculations have investigated an alternate way of looking into the matter through surface-enhanced Raman spectra. The calculations do not necessarily show that these metal oxides are the ideal materials for NA detection using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This enhancement needs to be increased several orders of magnitude for detection purposes, and the metal oxides are not really ideal for getting such intensities. Our results, on the other hand, indicate that the adsorption of DFP on metal oxides is an important phenomena, as it shows how the intensity of P@O stretching mode is enhanced because of such interactions. We believe that this particular property of NA-adsorption could be used to design efficient materials for NA detection. 4. Conclusions The adsorptions of DFP on M16O16 (M = Mg, Ca) clusters have been investigated using the DFT/B3LYP technique. The geometries of the interacting components and the complexes were fully optimized, and the results shows that the optimized M16O16Á Á ÁDFP (M = Mg, Ca) complexes serve as a model for studying the adsorption and spectroscopic properties of DFP on the respective oxide surfaces. The calculated interaction energies and the corresponding thermodynamic properties at the DFP/B3LYP and MP2 levels show that DFP is physisorbed on these surfaces and adsorption on the model MgO surface is stronger. Analyses of the calculated IR and Raman spectra

point to the enhancement of P@O stretching mode with respect to the isolated DFP. This particular property of DFP shows the possibility of using it to detect NAs through surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.
