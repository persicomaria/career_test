Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) negatively regulates insulin signaling in part by dephosphorylating key tyrosine residues within the regulatory domain of the -subunit of the insulin receptor (IR), thereby attenuating receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Inhibition of PTP1B is therefore anticipated to improve insulin resistance and has recently become the focus of discovery efforts aimed at identifying new drugs to treat type II diabetes. We previously reported that the tripeptide Ac-Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-NH2 is a surprisingly effective inhibitor of PTP1B (Ki ) 5 µM). With the goal of improving the stability and potency of this lead, as well as attenuating its peptidic character, an analogue program was undertaken. Specific elements of the initial phase of this program included replacement of the N- and C-termini with non-amino acid components, modification of the tyrosine subunit, and replacement of the tyrosine sulfate with other potential phosphate mimics. The most potent analogue arising from this effort was triacid 71, which inhibits PTP1B competitively with a Ki ) 0.22 µM without inhibiting SHP-2 or LAR at concentrations up to 100 µM. Overall, the inhibitors generated in this work showed little or no enhancement of insulin signaling in cellular assays. However, potential prodrug triester 70 did induce enhancements in 2-deoxyglucose uptake into two different cell lines with concomitant augmentation of the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of insulin-signaling molecules. Key elements of the overall SAR reported herein include confirmation of the effectiveness and remarkable PTP1B-specificity of the novel tyrosine phosphate bioisostere, O-carboxymethyl salicylic acid; demonstration that the tyrosine skeleton is optimal relative to closely related structures; replacement of the p-1 aspartic acid with phenylalanine with little effect on activity; and demonstration that inhibitory activity can be maintained in the absence of an N-terminal carboxylic acid. An X-ray cocrystal structure of an analogue bearing a neutral N-terminus (69) bound to PTP1B is reported that confirms a mode of binding similar to that of peptidic substrates.
Introduction An important component of the current therapy for type II diabetes has been the administration of agents that augment secretion of insulin from the pancreas. While this effectively reduces circulating plasma glucose levels in some patients, it does not address the underlying factor responsible for the hyperglycemia, namely the insulin resistance of the peripheral tissues.1 Under normal physiological conditions, insulin exerts its effects via initially binding to the extracellular domain (Rsubunit) of the insulin receptor (IR), thereby effecting a conformational change in the intracellular domain ( subunit) of the IR. This in turn activates an intrinsic tyrosine kinase present on the -subunit, resulting in the phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues within the -subunit (autophosphorylation).2a In this phosphorylated state, the IR possesses high tyrosine kinase activity toward proximal signaling molecules such as insulin

receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Following multiple tyrosyl phosphorylations, IRS-1 propagates the insulin signal by docking with and subsequently activating a number of effector proteins. The insulin signal branches at this point, eventually leading to the multiple observed responses to insulin that occur within minutes (e.g., glucose uptake) or many hours (e.g., mitogenesis).2b The underlying defect in type II diabetes is an attenuation of this insulin-signaling cascade, apparently originating at or near the level of the IR itself.3 One strategy to combat this insulin resistance therapeutically may be to maintain insulin receptors (IR) in the active tyrosine-phosphorylated form by inhibiting enzymes that catalyze IR dephosphorylation. There is evidence that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) catalyzes IR dephosphorylation and is involved physiologically and pathologically in terminating insulin signaling. This evidence includes descriptions of both in vitro4,5 and in vivo6 interactions between PTP1B and IR. Purified PTP1B dephosphorylates IR, apparently in the sequence observed in vivo, and dephosphorylation results in loss of IR tyrosine kinase activity.7 Intracellular delivery of neutralizing antibodies against PTP1B was found to augment IR and IRS-1 phosphorylation,8

while conversely, overexpression of PTP1B in transfected cells inhibited IR and IRS-1 phosphorylation.9 Furthermore, PTP1B activity is increased in some tissues of obese insulin-resistant patients10 and is reduced in parallel with the increased insulin sensitivity that accompanies weight loss.10,11 Experimentally induced insulin resistance in a variety of cell models is accompanied by an increase in PTP1B activity.12,13 In addition, correction of glucose-induced insulin resistance in Rat1 fibroblasts with a thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizer also corrects the elevation of PTP1B activity in the insulin-resistant cells.13 Recently, it was reported that PTP1B null mice have increased insulin sensitivity and decreased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity, but otherwise appear normal.14 Inhibition of PTP1B may thus be an effective means by which to treat type II diabetes, and research in this field has accelerated dramatically in recent years. Because the catalytic activity of PTP1B relies on the viability of an active site cysteine thiol (Cys215), inhibition of the enzyme can be readily achieved by simple complexation with metals, chemical oxidation, or capture with electrophiles.15 It is unlikely, however, that any of these approaches will provide inhibitors with specificity for PTP1B over the many other PTP enzymes present in cells, a requirement that would be expected for a safe drug with minimal side effects. An alternative approach, which is more likely to be selective, is to develop reversible competitive inhibitors that mimic the natural substrate, a phosphotyrosine-containing polypeptide. Because tyrosine phosphates are chemically labile, intensive research has been undertaken to develop chemically and enzymatically stable mimics that maintain high affinity for the enzyme active site.16,17 Examples of functional groups successfully employed as phosphate mimics in PTP1B inhibitors include methylenephosphonate, difluoromethylenephosphonate, sulfate, malonate, and carboxylate.17 At the outset of the present work, it was generally accepted that a minimum of six amino acid residues was required for peptidic substrates or inhibitors to possess high affinity for PTP1B.18 We were, therefore, surprised to discover that the simple tripeptide Ac-NH-Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-NH2 (1) is a highly effective inhibitor of PTP1B (Ki ) 5 µM).19 A similar result was recently obtained by Ramachandran et al., who reported that the simple sulfotyrosyl-containing tetrapeptide AcDE(sY)Nle inhibits PTP1B with an IC50 of 2 µM.20 Because of the relatively low molecular weight of our tripeptide inhibitor, we were encouraged to embark on an analogue program aimed at developing peptidomimetic inhibitors based on this peptide lead, an endeavor that ultimately led to the identification of submicromolar inhibitors of relatively low molecular weight (<600 Da) and the achievement of insulin-sensitizing effects in cells.19 In this report, we provide details of the design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of this novel class of PTP1B inhibitors. Chemistry A simplified version of tripeptide 1 lacking the terminal amides was prepared as in Scheme 1.

anhydride afforded succinamide 4. Sulfation of the phenolic oxygen with sulfur trioxide-pyridine then generated sulfotyrosine analogue 5. Preparation of an O-malonate analogue of 5 is described in Scheme 2. Deprotection of 3 and acylation with monobenzyl succinate provided benzyl ester 6. Rhodium-catalyzed alkylation of the phenol with di-tertbutyl diazomalonate21 afforded triester 7, which was sequentially deprotected with TFA and catalytic hydrogenation to provide the desired triacid 8. Basic hydrolysis of the esters was avoided at this point to minimize the chances of racemization at the chiral center. The route in Scheme 2 had to be modified to allow facile generation of analogues with varying substituents at the N- and C-termini. Two different routes to Nterminal analogues are depicted in Scheme 3. Alkylation of protected tyrosines 3 and 10 with 2-halomalonate esters afforded the O-malonates 11. We consistently observed the generation of small amounts of halogenated byproducts in these alkylations (e.g., 15) that could not be easily removed chromatographically.22

Fortunately, subsequent catalytic hydrogenations effectively converted these side products into the desired products, presumably via facile reduction of the halogens. Urethanes 11 were deprotected with either HCl or catalytic hydrogenation to afford amines 12. Acylation of the free amines could be effected either directly

with various anhydrides or with carboxylic acids under the influence of EDC to give amides 13. Final removal of the malonate esters was then accomplished either by catalytic hydrogenation or saponification with LiOH, affording malonic acids 14 (specific analogues are compiled in Table 2). The latter conditions have been frequently reported to successfully effect ester hydrolyses without racemization of amino acid chiral centers. We confirmed this in our own work with later diastereomeric analogues (vide infra). Synthetic routes analogous to that depicted for the conversion of 2 to 14 in Scheme 3 were used to prepare analogues incorporating

a modified or substituted tyrosine core. Thus, starting with racemic N-Boc-homotyrosine, o-fluorotyrosine, and pentafluorotyrosine, analogues 19, 20, and 21 (Table 1) were obtained, respectively. Scheme 4 similarly outlines two alternate routes to analogues modified at the C-terminus. Tyrosine ester 25 was acylated with monosuccinate esters as previously described. Alkylation with halomalonate esters proceeded as before to provide the desired malonate ethers 27 in good yields. Selective deprotection of the C-terminal ester was effected with either TFA or via catalytic hydrogenation, and the free acid could be converted to various amides 29 with EDC and the appropriate amine. Final deprotection via hydrogenation or saponification afforded the desired triacids 30, specific examples of which are compiled in Table 2. Insertion of an aspartic acid residue is outlined in Scheme 5. Coupling of amine 12a with N-Boc-aspartic acid benzyl ester provided bis(amide) 31, which could be directly deprotected to triacid 32 via hydrogenation. Alternatively, the Boc group could be removed and the reslulting free amine could be acylated with succinic anhydride to afford mono acid 33. Hydrogenolytic removal of the benzyl esters then afforded tetraacid 34. The N-terminal amine could be capped with other acyl groups, as exemplified in Scheme 6. A route analogous to Scheme 5 was employed to insert phenylalanine-derived amino acids, although here the malonate was protected as the corresponding diethyl ester (exemplified in Scheme 7). After amide coupling

to generate 36, the esters could be directly removed via saponification to afford diacid 37, or the amine could be capped with succininc anhydride, leading to triacid 38 after final saponification. Careful comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum of 38 with the corresponding diastereromer 110 prepared from (R)-p-benzoylphenylalanine established that only a single diastereomer was present within the limits of detection. This important observation confirmed that no racemization of either chiral center was occurring under the saponification conditions. Scheme 8 summarizes the preparation of several additional tyrosine phoshate bioisostere analogues of 5. The phenol of 6 could be acylated with benzyl malonyl chloride and subsequently hydrogenated to provide the acyl malonate derivative 40. Simple alkylation of phenol 6 with benzyl bromoacetate followed by hydrogenation gave the carboxymethyl analogue 41. Sulfonylation of the phenol with methanesulfonic anhydride was em-

ployed to obtain the methylsulfonyl analogue 42. Homologated malonate analogues were prepared by conjugate addition of phenol 6 or 39 to either dimethyl or dibenzyl acetylenedicarboxylate. The dimethyl maleate 44 was directly saponified to the unsaturated analogue 45, whereas the dibenzyl maleate 43 was hydrogenated to afford the saturated analogue 46. Replacement of the phenolic oxygen of malonate analogue 8 with carbon is outlined in Scheme 9. Palladium-catalyzed olefination of the triflate derived from phenol 3 followed by ozonolysis afforded aldehyde 47.23 Knoevenagel condensation installed the unsaturated malonate moiety of 48. Following amine deprotection and acylation with succinic anhydride, diester 49 could

be directly saponified to unsaturated triacid 50 or hydrogenated to saturated triacid 51. Salicylate analogue 57 was prepared as illustrated in Scheme 10. Commercially available m-iodotyrosine 52 was Boc-protected and converted to the n-pentylamide 53 under standard conditions. Palladium-catalyzed carboxylation of the iodide in methanol afforded methyl ester 54. The phenol was alkylated with methyl bromoacetate under basic conditions, and the resulting diester 55 was N-acylated with succinic anhydride after cleavage of the Boc group. Monoacid 56 was then saponified to afford triacid 57. A simpler salicylate analogue 59 could be obtained from 54 by omitting the phenol alkylation step (Scheme 11). Monoamide analogues of 57 were prepared as illustrated in Scheme 12. Palladium-catalyzed carboxylation of 53 in the presence of benzyl alcohol provided benzyl ester 60. Alkylation of the phenol with 2-bro-

moacetamide gave monoamide 61, which was N-deprotected and N-acylated with monobenzyl succinate, affording diester 62. Hydrogenolysis then provided the target acetamido diacid 63. Benzamide analogue 67 was obtained by a similar route. Carbonylation of iodide 53 in the presence of hexamethyldisilazane followed by hydrolysis with aq HCl gave benzamide 64.24 Phenol alkylation with methyl bromoacetate, N-deprotection, and N-acylation as before gave benzamide monoester 66. Final saponification then afforded benzamide diacid 67. Insertion of an amino acid residue into 57 is summarized in Scheme 13. The overall route is analogous to that presented in Schemes 5 and 7. Diester 55 was N-deprotected prior to coupling with Boc-L-phenylalanine to generate 68. Direct saponification provided diacid 69. Alternatively, the amine could be deprotected and acylated with monomethyl succinate. The resulting triester 70 was then saponified to afford the target triacid 71.

Results and Discussion All new compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit a C-terminal truncated, soluble form of recombinant rat PTP1 and/or the equivalent soluble form of recombinant human PTP1B, using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as substrate, as previously described.19 Compounds were also tested for inhibition of other recombinant, purified PTP enzymes as an initial assessment of their specificity. Two PTP enzymes that are structurally dissimilar to PTP1B (LAR, a membranespanning PTP, and SHP-2, an SH2 domain-containing PTP involved in insulin signaling36) and a dual specificity phosphatase, cdc25b, were utilized as representatives of three major classes of enzymes with PTP

activity.19 Activity of compounds against TC-PTP, the known PTP that is structurally most similar to PTP1B, was also determined. For clarity, only inhibition data for LAR and SHP-2 are presented here. In general, however, all the PTP1B inhibitors tested inhibited cdc25b activity <30% at 100 µM, and none exhibited significant selectivity between PTP1B and TC-PTP. Where inhibition kinetics were determined, plots of V versus S at various concentration of inhibitor were generated and Ki values were computed using the direct linear method of Cornish-Bowden. These data are summarized in Tables 1-4. We reported recently the discovery that the simple sulfotyrosyl-containing tripeptide 1 retains essentially all of the activity (Ki ) 5 µM) of related octapeptidic PTP1B inhibitors.19 This encouraged us to embark on a peptidomimetic program wherein the peptidic characteristics of 1 would be attenuated and its chemical stability bolstered by replacement of the labile sulfate with a suitable bioisostere. A logical first step was the removal of the terminal amides, resulting in simple bis(amide) tyrosine sulfate 5 that retained significant, albeit reduced, activity (Ki ) 30 µM, Table 1) against PTP1. Subsequent replacement of the tyrosine sulfate moiety of 5 with an O-malonate (8) was based on the pioneering work of Sikorski,25 who first demonstrated that O-malonate could serve as a surrogate for phosphate, and that of Burke,26 who had already demonstrated that O-malonyltyrosine could be successfully incorporated as a tyrosine phosphate mimic into hexapeptidic inhibitors of PTP1B. In fact, malonate 8 proved to be an even more effective inhibitor than 5 and continued to display competitive inhibition kinetics with a Ki of 11 µM against PTP1B. Of particular interest was the observation that this simple low molecular weight bis(amide) malonate inhibited PTP1B with approximately 10-fold greater potency than it inhibited either LAR or SHP-2. As anticipated, the corresponding diester 73 was

devoid of inhibitory activity, suggesting that the mode of binding was very similar to that of larger peptides. A survey of other potential sulfate or malonate bioisosteres is presented in Table 1. Deleting one of the malonate carboxyl groups (41) or attaching the malonate to the tyrosine through one of the acyl groups (40) obliterated activity. Homologation of the malonate (45 and 46) was less deleterious but attenuated activity nonetheless. Attempted replacement of the phenolic oxygen with methylene or methine (51 and 50) also reduced inhibitory activity. This latter observation was further support for a peptidic binding mode, as it is known that the phenolic oxygen of tyrosine phosphate in a peptidic substrate participates in key hydrogenbonding interactions with an ordered water molecule.27 Overall, our results are consistent with those of Burke et al., who have recently reported that related monocarboxy analogues and analogues replacing the phenolic oxygen with carbon are relatively ineffective inhibitors of PTP1B.16a Installation of a fluorine ortho to the O-malonate was undertaken to possibly enhance hydrogen-bonding interactions with ordered water (20); however, no augmentation of activity was observed. In fact, even perfluorination of the O-malonyltyrosine aromatic ring (21) was ineffective at significantly improving inhibitory potency. Methanesulfonate and trifluoromethanesulfonate analogues 42 and 74 represent attempts to mimic the sulfate of 5 with neutral functionality. Neither had any significant activity, reinforcing the widely accepted belief that the active site of PTP1B will only recognize negatively charged molecules. An investigation of analogues incorporating a modified tyrosine scaffold was also undertaken to determine if the natural tyrosine template was optimal (Table 1). As expected, the configuration of the chiral center was critical, as indicated by the significantly lower activity of the enantiomeric analogue 72. Lengthening the benzyl tether between the aromatic ring and the bis(amide) backbone (19) by a single methylene abolished activity. This is an intriguing finding in light of a recent observation by Burke that peptidomimetic inhibitors of PTP1B may be somewhat limited in potential by the depth to which they can insert into the phosphotyrosine binding pocket.16a In our case, homologating the tyrosine moiety by one methylene unit was not beneficial, although in principle it should have allowed greater

access of the aromatic ring and carboxyl groups to the phosphate binding pocket. The most productive modification of the tyrosine ring entailed transference of one of the malonate carboxyl groups onto the meta position of the aromatic ring (57), which resulted in a marked improvement in potency, particularly against PTP1 (Ki ) 2.8 µM) (Table 1). The Burke group28 independently reported incorporation of this novel tyrosine phosphate bioisostere into hexapeptides at about the same time as our discovery,29 and Iversen and Andersen et al.30 have recently reported a similar tyrosine phosphate bioisostere, 2-(oxalylamino)benzoic acid. We found that the new aromatic carboxylic acid moiety itself was not sufficient for inhibitory activity, since removal of the O-carboxymethyl group obliterated activity (59). In fact, simple masking of either carboxyl of 57 as the corresponding primary carboxamide (63, 67) was similarly detrimental, establishing the critical importance of having both carboxyl groups present. Although it was expected that the bis(amide) backbone would eventually need to be modified to achieve acceptable pharmacokinetic properties, we decided to initially retain this functionality to facilitate rapid modification of the N- and C-termini. Table 2 summarizes our initial work in this area. On the basis of the prevailing peptidic SAR, it was assumed that the carboxyl group of the N-terminus would be required, since it corresponded to the P-1 aspartic acid present in the best peptidic PTP1B inhibitors. This was confirmed with ester and amide analogues 75 and 76, each of which had substantially attenuated activity relative to acid 8. A series of carboxylic acids was thus generated off the N-terminus (77-86) to investigate the effect of chain length, substitution, and conformational restriction. Unfortunately, none of the new analogues exhibited improved activity relative to the simple succinic acid of 8. Attention was then focused on the C-terminal n-pentyl amide. Chain length, simple substitution, and incorporation of heteroatoms or aromatic rings were all investigated (87-106). To our surprise, although removal of a single methylene unit was quite detrimental to activity (88), larger groups were not more effective (e.g., 87, 89, 90), suggesting that a shallow pocket of defined length was being accessed. Consistent with this hypothesis was the lack of improvement with the

addition of aromatic ring(s), both substituted and unsubstituted. Preliminary attempts to add hydrophilic functionality (e.g., 96, 102-104) were even less encouraging. It was of considerable interest to us to confirm that our small malonate PTP1B inhibitors bound in a mode similar to that of larger peptidic tyrosine phosphate substrates, because enzyme/substrate structural information was available that might guide further analogue design. Barford had recently published an X-ray structure of a catalytically inactive C215-S mutant of PTP1B bound to the hexapeptidic substrate DADEpYL-NH2.27 Recognizing that 8 was highly analogous to the central tripeptide (EpYL) of this substrate, it was logical to assume that introduction to 8 of either a C-terminal carboxamide or a second N-terminal carboxylic acid analogous to the hexapeptidic P-2 aspartic acid ought to augment binding, as both of these functionalities were reported by Barford to make hydrogen-bonding interactions with the enzyme. Analogues 105 (Table 2) and 34 (Table 3) were prepared to test these assumptions, and each of these analogues indeed proved to be significantly more active (Ki ) 2 µM) than 8 (Ki ) 12 µM). Although these analogues were now the most active to date and useful for supporting the proposed mode of binding, neither could be considered a step forward toward a viable drug. An attempt to replace the C-terminal primary carboxamide of 105 with hydroxyl (106) unfortunately attenuated activity. Fortunately, we subsequently noted that the terminal carboxylic acid moiety of 34 was not absolutely required for effective inhibition of PTP1. The simple N-Boc derivative 32 remained more active than 8, suggesting that the new amide moiety was in part responsible for the improved binding affinity. N-Cbz and N-alkanoyl derivatives 109 and 35 indeed were similarly active (Table 3). A second literature report provided a clue toward further improving the physical properties of 34 without sacrificing activity. Zhang reported that replacement of the P-1 glutamic acid residue of PTP1B substrate AcDADEpYLIPQQG with the photolabile amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) did not significantly alter its susceptibility to dephosphorylation by PTP1, a surprising observation in light of the markedly different physical properties of the Bpa residue relative to glutamic acid.31 Therefore, analogue 38 was prepared to test whether a similar replacement of the aspartic acid of 34 with L-Bpa would be viable. Importantly, we observed an increase in potency, achieving for the first time submicromolar activity against PTP1B (Ki ) 0.7 µM) (Table 3). As expected, the configuration of the new chiral center was important, as the corresponding analogue prepared from D-Bpa (110) was approximately 2 orders of magnitude less active. Subsequent SAR quickly determined that simple phenylalanine analogue 114 was just as effective as 38 and had the advantage of substantially lower molecular weight. Paring further down to the alanine derivative 118 eroded activity. Of particular interest was the improvement in specificity for PTP1 vs SHP-2 of 114 relative to 38 (Table 3). This at least suggests that higher lipophilicity may be detrimental to selectivity, a conclusion that is supported by other comparisons in this work (e.g., 109 is less specific for PTP1 than is 32; 115 is less specific than

116), and that is consistent with the known preference of SHP-2 for peptidic substrates with lipophilic residues N-terminal to the phosphotyrosine.37 The corresponding N-Boc derivatives again retained activity (37, 115-118), demonstrating for the first time in this series that effective inhibition of PTP1 could be achieved in the absence of an N-terminal carboxyl group, a finding of obvious importance from a drug development standpoint. Table 4 summarizes biological data for analogues that combine the most active tyrosine phosphate bioisostere (from 57) with the "optimized" N-terminus of 114. The two elements proved to be complementary, as the resulting analogue 71 inhibited PTP1B with a potency exceeding either of the forerunners (Ki ) 0.22 µM). Of particular interest was the observation that this improved potency vs PTP1B was associated with an essentially complete loss of activity against LAR and SHP2. The simple (S,S)-N-Boc derivative 69 also benefited from the new tyrosine phosphate bioisostere, achieving a Ki of 1.1 µM, the most potent analogue of this series lacking any N-terminal carboxyl group. The relative configuration of the chiral centers was again confirmed to be important by the markedly lower potency of the analogue 119 prepared from (R)-Boc-Phe. Unfortunately, none of the new analogues exhibited reproducible augmentation of insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) uptake into intact cells (L6 myocytes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, primary rat adipocytes) (representative data presented in Table 4). This is not altogether surprising, considering the impediment to cell penetration that would be expected to result from the charge associated with multiple carboxyl groups. In fact, it was demonstrated that a number of analogues from this series are extremely poor at penetrating a Caco-2 cell monolayer,32 with permeability coefficients generally less than 5 nm/s (data not shown). Prodrug esters were investigated as a logical recourse, two of which (68 and 70) indeed exhibited greatly enhanced penetration (permeability coefficients of 680 and 136 nm/s, respectively). Although 68 remained inactive at stimulating 2-DOG uptake into L-6 myocytes, 70 elicited an approximate doubling of 2-DOG uptake at a concentration of 100 µM (Table 4). Compound 70 caused a large increase in basal 2-DOG uptake by L6 myocytes, and this is consistent with the hypothesis that, in the absence of insulin, the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is not entirely quiescent and PTP1B is required to dampen spontaneous signaling. The large effect of 70 on basal 2-DOG uptake was subtracted when the effect of 70 on insulin-dependent 2-DOG uptake was computed, and this results in an apparent lack of effect of 70 in the presence of insulin. In fact, in a typical experiment (n ) 3) in which 70 was tested in this way, uptake in the presence of insulin (10 nM) but absence of 70 [50.6 ( 0.5 pmol min-1 (mg of protein)-1] was increased by 70 to a value [72.7 ( 0.3 pmol min-1 (mg of protein)-1] that was similar to the maximal observed with insulin (300 nM) alone [79.5 ( 1.3 pmol min-1 (mg of protein)-1]. The effect of 70 on 2-DOG uptake was accompanied by increased levels of IR and IRS-1 and -2 phosphorylation,19 evidence that inhibition of PTP1B was occurring within the cell, even though 70 itself is devoid of

inhibitory activity. Triester 70 also augmented 2-DOG uptake into and IR and IRS-1 phosphorylation of an insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocyte model.19 The triester is likely cleaved enzymatically in cells to an active component(s), because we demonstrated time-dependent hydrolysis of 70 to a mixture of mono- and diacids by porcine hepatic esterase (no triacid 71 was detected). Although not all of the components of this mixture could be identified unambiguously without independent syntheses, the mixture itself was shown to be active at inhibiting PTP1B, and inhibition was proportional to the amount of diacid product.19 The mode of binding of triacid 71 was eventually confirmed by solving an X-ray cocrystal structure with a C-terminal-truncated form of PTP1B.19 Since dissection of the N-terminal carboxyl group was likely to be a requirement for further development of this series, it was important to determine what effect, if any, this structural modification would have on the binding mode. Thus, 69 was selected for cocrystallization studies with PTP1B. The overall structure of the PTP1B compound 69 complex proved to be very similar to the previously reported structure of PTP1B with compound 7119 (Figures 1 and 2; coordinates have been deposited with the PDB under the file name 1JF7). This was not unexpected, as these two compounds only differ in the nature of their N-terminal substituent. As with 71, the binding of compound 69 is accompanied by closure of the WPD loop (comprising of residues 179-189) of the enzymes catalytic site. The peptide backbone portion of both bound inhibitors forms an extended -strand conformation closely resembling that seen previously for peptidic substrates.27 These compounds maintain two conserved hydrogen bonds between the Asp48 side chain and the main chain nitrogens on either side of the central O-carboxymethyl salicylic acid tyrosine phosphate mimic (P and P + 1 positions) and a third between the main chain nitrogen of Arg47 and the Boc carbonyl of the inhibitor at the P-1 position. The phenyl ring of the phosphotyrosine (pTyr) mimic also makes hydrophobic

packing interactions with the side chains of Tyr46, Val49, Ala217, Ile219, Gln262, and Phe181. In addition, the C-terminal pentyl chains (P + 1) of both compounds lay in a shallow hydrophobic pocket and form hydrophobic contacts with the side chains of Val49, Ile219, and Gln262. In the PTP1B-pTyr peptide crystal structures, two of the phosphate oxygen atoms of the pTyr residue make two hydrogen bonds, each to the main chain amides of Ser216, Ala217 and Ile219, Gly220, respectively.27 The phosphate mimic headgroups of both compounds 69 and 71 are positioned somewhat closer to the WPD loop than the phosphate group of the substrate, resulting in the loss of all four hydrogen bonds. These interactions with the backbone amides are instead formed by new structurally bound water molecules. These solvent molecules

form a network of hydrogen bonds between residues of the phosphate binding site (the amides of Ser216, Ile219, and Gly220, the NH1 of Arg221) and the ether oxygen of O-carboxymethyl salicylic acid headgroup itself (Figure 2). The positioning of the headgroup closer to the WPD loop also results in the displacement of a bound water molecule hydrogen bonded to Gln266 in the PTP1B-substrate structures with compensatory hydrogen bonds being formed by headgroup oxygens (Figure 2). The terminal carboxylate of the O-carboxymethyl salicylic acid headgroup makes a series of five hydrogen bonds to the main chain nitrogen of Phe182, the side chain amide of Gln266, the side chain NE1 and main chain nitrogen of Arg221, and to one of the ordered waters located in the phosphate binding site. The o-carboxyl substituent of the inhibitor in turn forms hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Lys120 (3.1 Å) and to two water molecules, including the one mentioned above. However, there is no significant interaction observed between the o-carboxylate and the side cain of Asp181 as was apparent in the PTP1B-71 complex, where they share a proton. This difference is probably due to the fact that the crystals of the PTP1B-69 complex were grown at a somewhat higher pH (8.0 vs 6.5), resulting in the Asp181 side chain carboxylate being unprotonated and thus unable to interact with the inhibitor. The only other significant difference in binding between compounds 69 and 71 is observed at the Nterminus, where the P-2 carboxylic acid function of compound 71 is replaced by a hydrophobic N-Boc group. As a consequence of the loss of a hydrogen bond between the terminal carboxylate of compound 71 and the Arg47 side chain, there is observed a concerted repositioning of both Arg47 and P-1 Phe side chains by about 3 Å. Yet despite this movement, both the hydrophobic interactions between these two side chains and the hydrogen bond between the P-1 carbonyl and the Arg47 main chain amide are maintained. This again demonstrates, as has been previously observed,19,34 the conformational plasticity of the Arg47 side chain to accommodate a variety of N-terminal ligand structures. Although there are two PTP1B molecules in the crystal unit cell, only one was seen to have a bound inhibitor. The binding site of the other PTP1B molecule is effectively blocked by crystal contacts from a symmetry-related PTP1B molecule. In particular, amino acids 236-240 in the symmetry-related enzyme make similar contacts with the binding site to those seen in the peptide substrate crystal structures. The symmetry related Lys233 is positioned equivalently to a substrate phosphotyrosine and is held in place by hydrogen bonds from the binding site Asp48 to the backbone amides of Lys233 and Asp240. The lysine, however, does not extend down to the phosphate cradle, which is occupied by a sulfate ion, but instead hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Gln262. Conclusions Directed screening of the Pharmacia compound collection for reversible competitive inhibitors of PTP1B bearing potential phosphotyrosine mimics resulted in the identification of sulfotyrosyl-containing octapeptides

with Ki values in the range of 5 µM. Inhibitory activity was subsequently determined to reside unexpectedly within the N-terminal tripeptidic sequence Ac-Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-NH2 (Ki ) 5 µM). An analogue program was launched to attenuate the peptidic character of this lead and to enhance its potency. Modifications in the early phase of this work included a survey of phosphate mimics, alteration of the core tyrosine template, N- and C-terminal replacements with non-amino acid components, and insertion of specific amino acids at the P-1 position to evaluate the mode of binding. Key analogues that guided the evolution of the SAR are summarized in Scheme 14. The most significant analogue arising from this work was 71, which possesses submicromolar affinity for PTP1B (Ki ) 0.22 µM) without significantly inhibiting LAR or SHP-2 at concentrations up to 100 µM. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a triester prodrug of this molecule (70) enhances insulin signaling in two different cell lines. Key elements of our SAR study that could guide future inhibitor design in this area include the following: confirmation of the remarkable effectiveness and PTP1B specificity of the novel tyrosine phosphate mimic O-carboxymethyl salicylic acid, demonstration that the tyrosine template is optimal relative to a number of closely related structures, successful replacement of the P-1 aspartic acid present in peptidic inhibitors with the neutral and lipophilic phenylalanine residue, and the observation that the N-terminal carboxyl group can be jettisoned altogether with retention of significant activity. Solution of the X-ray cocrystal structure of the neutral N-terminal analogue 69 bound to PTP1B revealed that the (Boc)Phe N-terminus interacts with the enzyme primarily through the urethane carbonyl group and through hydrophobic interactions with the aromatic ring.

Assays for PTP Activity. PTP catalytic activities were routinely measured as rates of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) in a 96-well microtiter plate format. Sources of the PTP enzymes used as well as details of the PTP assays are described elsewhere.19 Inhibitors were added to PTP assay mixtures as solutions in DMSO at 100 times the final concentration. For determinations of inhibitor kinetics, plots of V versus S at various concentrations of inhibitor were generated and Ki values were computed using the direct linear method of Cornish-Bowden (Enzpack3 software, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Measurement of Cellular Insulin Response. For the evaluation of PTP1B inhibitors as enhancers of insulin action, we measured rates of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose by L6 myocytes in the absence and presence of insulin at a concentration (10 nM) that supported half-maximal uptake.19 Data are expressed as percent basal (unstimulated) in the absence of compound and as percent insulin-stimulated, i.e.,
