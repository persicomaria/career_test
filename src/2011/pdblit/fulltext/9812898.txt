Structure of Human Methionine Aminopeptidase-2 Complexed with Fumagillin
Shenping Liu, Joanne Widom, Christopher W. Kemp, Craig M. Crews, Jon Clardy*
The fungal metabolite fumagillin suppresses the formation of new blood vessels, and a fumagillin analog is currently in clinical trials as an anticancer agent. The molecular target of fumagillin is methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP-2). A 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of free and inhibited human MetAP-2 shows a covalent bond formed between a reactive epoxide of fumagillin and histidine231 in the active site of MetAP-2. Extensive hydrophobic and water-mediated polar interactions with other parts of fumagillin provide additional affinity. Fumagillin-based drugs inhibit MetAP-2 but not MetAP-1, and the three-dimensional structure also indicates the likely determinants of this specificity. The structural basis for fumagillin's potency and specificity forms the starting point for structure-based drug design. Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, is a pathological determinant in tumor progression, diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis (1). The serendipitous discovery that fumagillin, a fungal metabolite, potently inhibits angiogenesis initiated the systematic development of small molecule angiogenesis inhibitors (2, 3) (Fig. 1). One semisynthetic derivative of fumagillin, TNP-470, is in clinical trials as an anticancer agent (Fig. 1) (3, 4). Fumagillinbased affinity reagents identified MetAP-2 as the specific cellular target of fumagillin, and

this specificity was confirmed with genetically altered yeast strains (5, 6). The correlation between the antiproliferative activity of several fumagillin analogs with their ability to inhibit MetAP-2 activity in vitro suggests that MetAP-2 is the physiologically relevant target of fumagillin-based therapeutic agents (6). This suggestion is strengthened by a recent report that human endothelial cells are especially sensitive to fumagillin and that proliferation of these cells can be blocked by human MetAP-2 antisense oligonucleotides (7). MetAPs, which

remove NH2-terminal methionines from proteins in a nonprocessive manner, are highly conserved in sequence (8) (Fig. 2). These cobalt-containing metalloproteases are divided into two families, type 1 (MetAP-1) and type 2 (MetAP-2), and fumagillin inhibits the in vivo activity of only MetAP-2 (5, 6). To investigate fumagillin's inhibitory mechanism, we determined the crystal structure of human MetAP-2 with and without bound fumagillin. Human MetAP-2 (HsMetAP-2) was expressed in Sf21 insect cells (9). Crystals of HsMetAP-2 were prepared, diffraction data were collected at the F1 station of CHESS, and the structure was solved by the molecular replacement method (10, 11). The structure has been refined to a final R factor of 0.183 and 0.194 for native and fumagillin-complexed HsMetAP-2, respectively, for the 1.8 to 25.0 Å data (Fig. 3A) (11). Earlier crystallographic studies of the MetAP-1 from Escherichia coli (EcMetAP1) (12) and the MetAP-2 from Pyrococcus furiosus (PfMetAP-2) (13) have defined the overall topology of the MetAP family. Like EcMetAP-1 and PfMetAP-2, HsMetAP-2 has a central sheet with an active site located roughly at the center of the sheet's concave face (Fig. 3B). Two pairs of helices ( 1- 2, 3- 4) and a short COOH-terminal tail cover the sheet's convex face (Fig. 3B). HsMetAP-2 has several features that distinguish it from the prokaryotic MetAPs (Fig. 2). HsMetAP-2, unlike EcMetAP-1 and PfMetAP2, has a 165-residue NH2-terminal extension, which is not essential for aminopeptidase activity (6). In the structure described here, the NH2-terminal extension is largely disordered, and clear electron density begins at Lys110 with a disordered loop from residues 138 to 153 (Fig. 3B). The visible portion of the NH2-terminal extension lies on the convex surface near helices 1 and 2 and far from the active site. Residues 381 to 444, the long insertion that distinguishes the MetAP-2 family from the MetAP-1 family (Fig. 2), comprise the end of 7, 5, 6, 7, and the beginning of 8 and form a compact domain that does not interact significantly with the rest of the protein (Fig. 3B). A small insertion, which includes 4 and the beginning of 5 (residues 312 to 319), distinguishes eukaryotic from prokaryotic MetAP-2. Neither of these insertions disrupts the MetAP-1 secondary structure (Figs. 2 and 3B). The insertions and NH2-terminal extension in HsMetAP-2 break the pseudo twofold symmetry of EcMetAP-1 (12). The active site is a deep pocket with two cobalts at its base and a completely covered side pocket that presumably serves as the specificity pocket for the NH2-terminal methionine side chain of natural substrates. Reorientation of the Tyr444 side chain and some water molecules opens this pocket to solvent. The Tyr444 residue is completely conserved in the

MetAP-2 family and comes at the end of the long insertion that distinguishes the MetAP-2 family (Fig. 2). In the absence of fumagillin, the cobalts are coordinated by Asp251, Asp262, His331, Glu364, Glu459, and a water molecule. The Asp262 and Glu459 residues are bidentate ligands coordinating both cobalts, Asp251 is bidentate with cobalt 1, Glu364 and His331 are monodentate with cobalt 2, and one clearly defined water molecule interacts with cobalt 2. All of the residues that coordinate the metals are on strands near the center of the sheet and are conserved in all MetAP sequences (Fig. 2). The electron density for fumagillin was clearly visible in the difference electron density synthesis (Fig. 3A). Fumagillin has several structural components arrayed around its conformationally fixed cyclohexane ring, and a comparison of the active site of HsMetAP-2 with and without fumagillin shows how each component contributes to binding (Fig. 4, A and B). Earlier work had established that covalent bond formation causes fumagillin's irreversible inhibition, and the x-ray structure shows a covalent bond between an imidazole nitrogen (N 2) atom of His231 and the carbon of the spirocyclic epoxide (5, 6 ) (Fig. 3B). The formation of this C­N bond, although not predicted, is analogous to the alkylation of a catalytic histidine by -chloroketone inhibitors of serine proteases (14). Histidine-231 does not move significantly upon bond formation; its nucleophilic imidazole nitrogen is perfectly positioned to bond with the methylene of the epoxide (Fig. 4B). The oxygen liberated from the breaking of the epoxide is coordinated with cobalt (3.28 Å), and it occupies the approximate position of the cobalt-associated water molecule in the uncomplexed structure. A water that is equidistant from both cobalts forms a hydrogen bond with this fumagillin oxygen (Fig. 4A). The only residue that moves significantly upon fumagillin complexation is His339, which rotates its side chain to avoid close contacts with fumagillin (Fig. 4B). The epoxide-bearing side chain of fumagillin occupies the completely covered pocket near the active site (Fig. 4B). It has hydrophobic contacts with His331 at the mouth of the pocket, Tyr444, Ile338, His339, and Phe219 (Fig. 4B). A well-defined water molecule forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain epoxide and the methoxyl group at C5 (Fig. 4A). The long unsaturated side chain protrudes from the binding pocket and makes two hydrophobic contacts with Leu328 and Leu447, and both residues are conserved in the MetAP-2 family (Figs. 3 and 4A). Leucine-447 lies near the end of the insertion that defines the MetAP-2 family, and the constriction formed by the Leu447-Leu328 pair provides a structural basis for the MetAP-2 family's requirement for a substrate with a small ( 1.3 Å radius of gyration) side chain at P2 (15). The terminal carboxyl of the side chain makes a hydrogen bond with Asp376. Fumagillin can be analyzed as a substrate mimic with the epoxide-bearing side chain resembling methionine's side chain and the opened epoxide substituting for a nucleophilic water near the scissile carbonyl bond. The long unsaturated side chain protruding from the pocket mimics the COOH-terminal peptide chain. The ability of fumagillin and related compounds to covalently inhibit MetAP-2 is even more remarkable in light of their specificity for MetAP-2 over MetAP-1 because the two enzymes have very similar active sites (Fig. 2). In yeast, either MetAP-1 or MetAP-2 function can be eliminated and the remaining enzyme will compensate (16). Elimination of both MetAP-1 and MetAP-2 function is lethal (16). Features that might generate such specificity can be highlighted by superimposing the 81 central core residues of HsMetAP-2 and EcMetAP-1 (0.83 Å root mean square deviation for main chain atoms) (Fig. 4C). In this superimposed model, EcHis79, the residue that would covalently bond fumagillin, is too far away to form a bond. Two compensatory modifications are possible: moving fumagillin by about 1.6 Å toward EcHis79 or moving EcHis79 toward fumagillin. Moving fumagillin leads to severe steric clashes of C5 and the C6 methoxyl group with EcTyr168 and of C7 and C8 with EcCys78 (Fig. 4C). Tyrosine-168 is conserved in the MetAP-1 family, and its smaller counterpart, Leu328, is conserved in the MetAP-2 family (Fig. 2). In addition to the steric clashes, the fumagillin oxygen that interacts with cobalt 2 would be more than 5 Å away from either cobalt, a distance greatly in excess of a metalwater interaction. Moving EcHis79 to bond with fumagillin also has troublesome features. The first is the assumption that EcHis79 can be moved because its position appears to be fixed by a series of hydrogen bonds involving both main and side chain atoms between 1 and 2. The positions of EcHis79 and HsHis231 are also influenced by the adjacent residues, which are strongly conserved in both families: Ala-Ala-His-Tyr/Phe in MetAP-2 and Val/Ile-Cys-His-Gly in MetAP-1 (Fig. 2). If EcHis79 could be moved to bond with fumagillin, there would be problems ac-

commodating fumagillin's side chain in the specificity pocket. In MetAP-1, the size of the conserved Phe177 (HsIle338) makes the pocket substantially narrower (Figs. 2 and 4C). The relatively slim side chain of methionine can be accommodated in this narrower pocket whereas the bulky and conformationally restricted side chain of fumagillin cannot. Because MetAP-1 lacks Tyr444 and has an open specificity pocket, the narrower pocket would be easily accessible. Thus, fumagillin's inability to inhibit MetAP-1 can be traced to the position of the nucleophilic His in MetAP-1, the difficulty of repositioning this residue because of consistent size differences in the adjacent residues, and a narrowing of the specificity pocket. Our results provide a structural framework for understanding the relation of human MetAP-2 to prokaryotic and other eukaryotic MetAPs, fumagillin's ability to inhibit MetAP-2, and the basis of fumagillin's specificity. Insights from this analysis will also be useful in structure-based drug design. Fumagillin-based therapeutics such as TNP-470 share fumagillin's conformationally rigid template and key features. The two drugs differ in the side chain at C6, a region that shows few, if any, ligand interactions. Thus, TNP-470 is likely to inhibit MetAP-2 by occupying the active site in the same fashion as fumagillin.

(Bio-Rad, CHT type 1) column equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 400 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. We obtained more than 20 mg of pure MetAP-2 per liter of culture. Mass spectroscopy gave a molecular weight of 53,060, and the NH2-terminus appeared to be blocked. The protein was stored at 4°C in 10 mM Hepes, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CoCl2. 10. Crystals of HsMetAP-2 were grown in 1 to 2 weeks at 4°C from sitting drops, with a protein concentration of 12 mg/ml in 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 10% glycerol, and 100 mM NaCl. The reservoir solution contained 15 to 30% t-butanol in 33 to 100 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.2 to 5.6. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221 with a 90.49 Å, b 99.38 Å, and c 101.59 Å and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit. HsMetAP-2­fumagillin complex crystals were prepared by adding 1 l of 50 mM fumagillin (ethanol) directly into a crystallization drop and equilibrated for 12 hours before mounting. 11. We collected data for both MetAP-2 and its fumagillin complex to a resolution of 1.8 Å (154,879 and 158,945 measurements of 42,194 and 40,944 unique reflections, 98.8% and 94.7% completeness, 3.7 and 3.9 redundancy, and Rsym values of 0.069 and 0.078, respectively) at the F1 station of CHESS (Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source) using 0.922 Å raI ­ I / I , where I is the diation (Rsym integrated intensity of a given reflection). Phases were obtained by the molecular replacement technique as implemented in AMoRe [J. Navaza, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 50, 157 (1994)] and the 1.75 Å resolution model of PfMetAP-2 (13), Protein Data Bank accession code 1XGS. Extensive model building with O [T. A. Jones, J. Y. Zou, S. W. Cowan, M. Kjeldgaard, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A 47, 110 (1991)] and rigid body and restrained refinement with X-PLOR [A. T. Brunger, J. Kuriyan, M. Karplus, ¨ Science 235, 458 (1987)] and REFMAC [G. N. Murshudov, A. A. Vagin, E. J. Dodson, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 53, 240 (1997)] brought the conventional R and Rfree (calculated for 7% and 5% of the data not used for the refinement of native and complex, respectively) below 0.20 and 0.25, respectively. At this stage in the structure of the fumagillin complex, a fumagillin model could easily be built into the well-defined difference electron density map. The current models include 355 residues (110 through 138 and 153 through 478), two cobalt atoms, 240 waters, and two t-butanols for the native structure. In the complex structure, there are 203 waters, no t-butanols, and 33 fumagillin atoms. The current R values from 25.0 to 1.8 Å are 0.183 and 0.194 for the native and complex structures (0.228 and 0.231 for Rfree). The root mean square deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles are 0.012 Å and 2.2°. S. L. Roderick and B. W. Matthews, Biochemistry 32, 3907 (1993). T. H. Tahirov et al., J. Struct.

This plasmid was cotransfected with BacVector-3000 (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI) into Sf9 cells. The virus was cloned and the protein expressed in Sf21 cells grown in Cyto-SF9 medium (Kemp Biotechnologies, Frederick, MD). A cell pellet from 2.5 liters of culture was lysed in 100 ml of 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. The lysate was centrifuged at 48,000g for 1 hour, and two volumes of 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) were added to the supernatant. The material was applied to an SPSepharose (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 10 mM Hepes. The column was washed with the Hepes containing 100 mM NaCl, and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 500 mM NaCl in Hepes buffer. Fractions with MetAP-2 were combined and dialyzed against 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and applied to a hydroxylapatite

A Structural Explanation for the Recognition of Tyrosine-Based Endocytotic Signals
David J. Owen and Philip R. Evans*
Many cell surface proteins are marked for endocytosis by a cytoplasmic sequence motif, tyrosine-X-X-(hydrophobic residue), that is recognized by the 2 subunit of AP2 adaptors. Crystal structures of the internalization signal binding domain of 2 complexed with the internalization signal peptides of epidermal growth factor receptor and the trans-Golgi network protein TGN38 have been determined at 2.7 angstrom resolution. The signal peptides adopted an extended conformation rather than the expected tight turn. Specificity was conferred by hydrophobic pockets that bind the tyrosine and leucine in the peptide. In the crystal, the protein forms dimers that could increase the strength and specificity of binding to dimeric receptors. The localization and movement of compartment-specific proteins within the cell is largely achieved through the recognition of short sequence motifs by targeting proteins. One of the most studied processes involving such signal recognition is clathrin-mediated endocytosis,

which occurs in vesicle trafficking and the internalization of nutrient and growth factor receptors when bound to their appropriate cargo molecules [reviewed in (1)]. During the internalization of activated growth factor receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase [reviewed in (2)], receptors are removed from the cell surface in clathrin-coated vesicles and ultimately directed to the endosome and lysosome, where they are inactivated by proteolytic degradation (3, 4).
