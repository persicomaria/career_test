Aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) are delivered to the ribosome as part of the ternary complex of aa-tRNA, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) study, at a resolution of 9 Å, showing that during the incorporation of the aa-tRNA into the 70S ribosome of Escherichia coli, the flexibility of aa-tRNA allows the initial codon recognition and its accommodation into the ribosomal A site. In addition, a conformational change observed in the GTPaseassociated center (GAC) of the ribosomal 50S subunit may provide the mechanism by which the ribosome promotes a relative movement of the aa-tRNA with respect to EF-Tu. This relative rearrangement seems to facilitate codon recognition by the incoming aa-tRNA, and to provide the codon-anticodon recognition-dependent signal for the GTPase activity of EF-Tu. From these new findings we propose a mechanism that can explain the sequence of events during the decoding of mRNA on the ribosome.

In translation, aa-tRNA, EF-Tu and GTP form a ternary complex that binds to the ribosome, allowing codon-anticodon pairing in the 30S ribosomal subunit. Cognate codon recognition triggers fast GTP hydrolysis on EF-Tu1, and the ensuing conformational changes of the factor2,3 lead to its dissociation. This allows the aa-tRNA4 to accommodate into the ribosomal intersubunit cavity, where it reaches the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC) in the ribosomal 50S subunit5. The orientation of the incoming aa-tRNA differs substantially from the orientation of the tRNA residing in the ribosomal A site6­9. Thus, for the initial codon-anticodon pairing to form, either the binding of the ternary complex to the ribosome must be different from that in the complexes of 70S ribosome, aa-tRNA and EF-Tu described6­9, or the process requires an incoming aa-tRNA to be able to recognize the A site codon in a sterically less favorable approach. Recent cryo-EM structures8,9 have suggested that the anticodon arm of the aa-tRNA in the A/T site, while interacting with EF-Tu, has a conformation that differs from those of the known structures for tRNAs, and that this modified tRNA structure might allow a codon recognition in a local, steric configuration similar to that seen for the A-site tRNA. However, the limited resolution of those studies (15­20 Å) did not provide enough definition to model the postulated structural change in the A/T-site tRNA, and the appearance of the anticodon arm of the tRNA was qualitatively described as "kinked"8 or "distorted"9.

During ternary complex recognition, the interaction of EF-Tu with the ribosome greatly stimulates the factor's GTPase activity10, and the ensuing hydrolysis of the nucleotide separates the two steps for the selection of cognate tRNAs11: `initial selection' before GTP hydrolysis and `proofreading'12,13 after the hydrolysis. The kinetics of the different binding steps have been characterized in detail11,14. In the initial selection, codon-anticodon interaction leads to structural changes in the aa-tRNA15. These are followed by a local conformational change in the vicinity of the GTP binding site of EF-Tu16 that ultimately leads to hydrolysis of the GTP molecule on the factor. Both the GTP binding region in EF-Tu and the GAC in the ribosome are distant from the decoding center in the 30S subunit. Nevertheless, rapid triggering of the GTP hydrolysis on EF-Tu requires that the codon in the A site is recognized by the cognate anticodon15 of an intact aa-tRNA17. Unanswered questions thus far are (i) how the codon recognition by the aa-tRNA affects the active center of EF-Tu to induce the hydrolysis of GTP, and (ii) what role the GAC plays in this process. In the present work we have addressed these questions by analyzing cryo-EM maps depicting the E. coli ribosome in two states of tRNA incorporation, characterized as A/T-site and A-site binding states. This analysis reveals that the decoding process is facilitated by a dynamic interplay between the ribosome and the tRNA in which the tRNA acts like a molecular spring.

RESULTS We have obtained cryo-EM maps at 9-Å resolution for ribosomes, originally with fMet-tRNAfMet in the P site, that were allowed to react with the ternary Phe-tRNAPhe­EF-Tu­GTP complex either in the presence or in the absence of kirromycin (kir) (see Methods). The antibiotic kir binds to the ternary complex and effectively prevents dissociation of EF-Tu from the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis on the factor18,19. In the presence of the antibiotic, the ribosome contained a stalled Phe-tRNAPhe­EF-Tu­GDP­kir complex. In its absence, the ribosome contained fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe in the A site and deacylated tRNAfMet in the P site. In the map for the 70S­fMet-tRNAfMet­PhetRNAPhe­EF-Tu­GDP­kir (Fig. 1a), the stalled ternary complex is clearly visible. The overall position of the aa-tRNA­EF-Tu­GDP­kir complex is as described before6,8,9, but the densities for Phe-tRNAPhe (pale pink) and EF-Tu (red) can be discerned as separate as a result of the improved resolution. When the complex is made in the absence of kir, the fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe appears in the A site (magenta) after accommodation and peptide bond formation (Fig. 1b). Because of the high affinity of uncharged tRNAs for the E site, this region is seen occupied by deacylated tRNAs in both maps. The decoding site Because the present maps represent direct structural data on the steps of decoding and accommodation, we analyzed the conformation of the decoding site in the 30S ribosomal subunit both with aa-tRNA in the A/T site (Fig. 2a) and, after accommodation as peptidyl-tRNA in the A site. By comparing the present maps with a control map, which had fMet-tRNAfMet in the P site and a vacant A site, we detected in both cases an additional mass in the A-site codon region (asterisk in Fig. 2a). This can be rationalized as the presence of density from the

helix fragment formed by codon and anticodon in the cognate mRNAtRNA pairing. There is also an empty space in SH44 (ref. 20; indicated with an arrow in Fig. 2a), in comparison with the control. (For brevity, rRNA helices are denoted as `SH' for the 16S rRNA from the small 30S subunit, or `LH' for the 23S rRNA from the large 50S subunit.) These results invite a comparison with results from X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of the 30S subunit from Thermus thermophilus in complex with mRNA and a fragment of the cognate tRNA composing the anticodon stem loop (ASL)21 served to characterize the changes in the structure of the decoding center upon codon-anticodon recognition. Introduction of the cognate ASL fragment induced a flipping-out of the universally conserved bases A1492 and A1493 from their original positions inside an internal loop of SH44. These two bases are essential for viability and A-site tRNA binding. When they interact with the minor groove of the first two base pairs of the codonanticodon helix21, they vacate the positions they originally occupied in SH44. We have used the atomic coordinates from that work to interpret the structure of the decoding site as seen in our cryo-EM maps. To this end, the crystal structure of the 30S subunit was docked as a rigid body inside the density of the small subunit of our cryo-EM map of the ribosome with a stalled ternary complex. Inspection of the decoding center (Fig. 2b) reveals that the low-density region within SH44 in the cryo-EM density map (Fig. 2a) matches the internal loop in the tip of SH44 that becomes vacant when A1492 and A1493 flip out as the result of a cognate codon-anticodon interaction. This means that changes in the crystal structure of the 30S subunit resulting from interactions between a tRNA analog and mRNA are reproduced in the more realistic setting of the present study.

The fitting was done using the coordinates as a rigid body and looking for an optimal docking for EF-Tu. The domains of EF-Tu are labeled I, II and III. The positions of the GTP analog from the crystal structure (GDPNP), the antibiotic kirromycin (kir), the aminoacyl moiety (aa) and the effector loop within domain I of EF-Tu are also labeled.

Arrangement of EF-Tu and aa-tRNA on the ribosome The resolution of the cryo-EM map for the 70S­fMet-tRNAfMet­PhetRNAPhe­EF-Tu­GDP­kir complex depicted in Figure 1b is substantially better (9 Å) than in former reports6­9. The improved definition has been used to refine the description of the structural relationship among EF-Tu, aa-tRNA and the ribosome. Recently, the structure for the Phe-tRNAPhe­EF-Tu­GDPNP­kir complex was solved (R.C.N. et al., unpublished data), and we used those coordinates for the docking of the ternary complex inside our cryo-EM densities for the aatRNA residing in the A/T site and for EF-Tu (Fig. 3a). The fitting was initially done with aa-tRNA­EF-Tu taken as a rigid body, but a relative movement between EF-Tu and aa-tRNA was found to improve the fit to the map (Fig. 3b). The atomic structure of EF-Tu fits well into the cryo-EM map. The docking of the factor did not require any relative movement among the three domains of EF-Tu, indicating that the architecture of EFTu­GDP, stalled by kir in the ternary complex with Phe-tRNAPhe on the ribosome, is very similar to the crystal structure of EF-Tu­GDPNP in complex with Phe-tRNAPhe and kir. It is only the `effector loop' region in domain I that is outside of the cryo-EM density for EF-Tu (Fig. 3a). The secondary structure and relative position of this region change in the transition from EF-Tu­GTP to EF-Tu­GDP22,23. The effector loop is very close to the guanine nucleotide binding pocket (GDPNP in the crystal structure) and contains some of the residues postulated to have a central role in the GTPase activity of EF-Tu24. Our failure to detect a density for this region indicates that the effector loop is flexible in the stalled ternary complex and that its density disappears as a result of averaging. Similarly, the crystal structure of free EFTu­GDP­aurodox (aurodox is a methylated derivative of kir) shows disorder in the effector loop25. The local conformational changes in the GTP binding region of EF-Tu that are associated with GTP hydrolysis on the ribosome are to some extent stabilized in the presence of

kir16. Thus, the EF-Tu­GDP­kir structure that we see may correspond to the one that is activated for the hydrolysis of the nucleotide, and it is the conformation that immediately follows GTP hydrolysis, yet precedes the conformational change to the free GDP-bound structure and hence EF-Tu release. Additionally, the residues Arg58 and Ile60 in EFTu (E. coli numbering for aminoacyl residues is used throughout), postulated to participate in the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by EFTu24, are both within the effector loop. Thus, the movement of the flexible effector loop might be the change in EF-Tu that is responsible for the activation of its GTPase activity during its interaction with the ribosome. Available crystal structures for the ribosomal subunits21,26 were used as a source for atomic coordinates that were fitted into the cryoEM map for the 70S­Met-tRNAfMet­Phe-tRNAPheEF-Tu­GDP­kir complex. The resulting atomic model allowed us to study the interactions between the ternary complex and several ribosomal elements that are represented in Figure 3c. EF-Tu interacts with the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) around positions 2661­2663 of the 23S rRNA, as described earlier27,28. This binding is probably established through residues within the effector loop of EF-Tu, but the putative flexibility of this region would prohibit a precise definition of the contact. Domain II of EF-Tu is bound to SH5 around the base pair formed by nucleotides 57 and 356 of 16S rRNA. The amino acid in EF-Tu that is closest to SH5 is Gly222 (E. coli numbering), and mutations in Gly222 inhibit the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of the factor29,30. Apart from the codon-anticodon pairing in the decoding site of the ribosomal 30S subunit21, three additional interactions between the tRNA and the ribosome can be defined. In the acceptor arm of the aatRNA, near nucleotide 69, there is a contact with amino acids 78­80 of protein S12. This is the only interaction that we observe between the tRNA and S12, and in our interpretation of the cryo-EM map, the previously postulated interaction of S12 with the D stem of the tRNA9 is

absent. Nucleotide 56 within the T arm, situated in the elbow region of the tRNA within the conserved TCG sequence (position 56 is the C), is close enough to interact with residue 1067 from LH43 in the GAC. The interaction between this highly conserved region in the tRNA and the fragment of the 23S rRNA is clearly discerned, but again, in contrast to previous claims based on lower-resolution cryo-EM results9, the tRNA is not seen to contact protein L11 situated on the same lobe of the GAC. Finally, LH69 establishes a clear interaction (around the nucleotide in position 1914) with the D arm of the aa-tRNA (approximately with residues 24­25 of the aa-tRNA). A flexible tRNA We have shown that the atomic structure of the ternary complex cannot be docked to the ribosome in its entirety as a rigid body, suggesting the existence of relative movements between EF-Tu and aa-tRNA, which must be partly stabilized by kir binding. However, even if relative movements between rigid EF-Tu and aa-tRNA molecules are allowed, the ASL will necessarily remain outside the cryo-EM map for the A/T site tRNA (Fig. 4a). Fortunately, the good definition of the helical regions of tRNA at 9-Å resolution in the present map allowed us to model a distinct conformation of the anticodon arm (see Methods) that fits the obtained density quite well (Fig. 4b) and puts the ASL in a position and orientation that closely match those seen in the A site tRNA (Fig. 4c). Most notably, this novel tRNA conformation could allow a similar codon-anticodon interaction for a tRNA in the A/T and A sites. A comparison of the structure of the aa-tRNA in our model with the atomic coordinates from X-ray crystallography (Fig. 4d) reveals that in the modeled coordinates the anticodon arm is reoriented by a bending at the junction of the anticodon and D stems that defines the `kink'8 in

the tRNA (dashed line in Fig. 4d). In the highly conserved architecture of tRNAs, the connection between the D and the anticodon stems is a complex structure that involves tertiary interactions between residues from the D stem and the variable region of the tRNA. This D­anticodon stem junction was understood as a hinge in one of the first reports describing the atomic structure of a tRNA31. In all the available crystal structures for tRNAs, the nucleotide at position 26, which separates the D and the anticodon stems, is an unpaired base that is partially intercalated with residues 44 and 45 of the variable loop (nucleotides 26, 44 and 45 are dark blue in Fig. 4e), and this particular conformation was associated with the relative tilt between the D and anticodon stems31. The exact details of the tRNA deformation cannot be determined at atomic resolution from the available data, but it clearly occurs near this putative hinge. In our model the deformation leading to the movement of the ASL relative to the acceptor­T stem is distributed smoothly over the four base pairs immediately surrounding the junction between the D and anticodon stems. Thus the model preserves the local features of the tRNA crystal structure for the lower part of the ASL, for the upper part of the D stem and for the rest of the molecule. We expect the changes in the tertiary structure to increase the electrostatic repulsion and the torsion angle energy of the phosphate backbone. Reorientation of the anticodon stem loop Our results show that the aa-tRNA is flexible enough to adopt a conformation that allows optimal codon-anticodon interaction to develop while the tRNA is in the A/T site. There is no indication that the mRNA codon in the A site can change its orientation. However, our present resolution does not allow an unambiguous determination of the structure of the codon-anticodon interaction, so we cannot rule out the

existence of some rearrangements in the a b c decoding site. In any case, the observed reorientation of the anticodon arm of the aa-tRNA seems to be an essential mechanism during this cognate codon recognition by the tRNA while it resides in the A/T position. In the crystal structure of the aa-tRNA­EF-Tu­GDP­kir complex (R.C.N. et al., unpublished results), the atoms in the anticodon arm have the highest temperature factors, suggesting that this region is indeed flexible. Increased tempera- d ture factors for the ASL relative to the rest of the molecule have been known from X-ray crystallographic studies on tRNA32, and flexibility in this region was predicted by early molecular dynamics simulations33. The structural change in the aa-tRNA may be induced by several variables: (i) interaction with ribosomal elements (ii) conformational changes in the decoding center upon codon recognition or (iii) GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu.

aa-tRNAs with high probability become stably bound in the A site. All these steps have been characterized biochemically and are understood as sequential, stochastic changes of the system that with high probability lead to the final acceptance of a cognate tRNA or the dissociation of a near- or noncognate tRNA. However, the structural basis that can explain the sequence of events remains unknown. Here we propose a model that explains mechanistically how aa-tRNAs are delivered to and selected by the ribosome following the tempod c b ral sequence of the events. The first selection involves the codon recognition by the aa-tRNA, and the triggering of the GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu. In this cryo-EM study we have observed two conformational changes in addition to the change of the tRNA structure reported before; one change affects the position of the GAC lobe in the ribosomal 50S subunit, and another change alters the relative position between aa-tRNA and EF-Tu as a cognate ternary complex binds to the ribosome. These observations suggest that the two Figure 6 Coupling of the conformational change of the GAC with the movement of aa-tRNA. conformational changes might be linked, (a) Comparison of the aa-tRNA position defined inside the cryo-EM density for the ternary complex because the relative movement between aa(green) versus the position of the aa-tRNA in the atomic coordinates of Phe-tRNAPhe­EF-Tu­GDPNP­kir tRNA and EF-Tu could be rationalized if it was (gray).

For this purleaves the ribosome and fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe assumes its position in the pose, we have kept EF-Tu bound to the immobile SRL in a fixed posiA site, the GAC lobe moves back to its original position (inset in Fig. tion. In Figure 6a it can be seen that the aa-tRNA defined in our 5c). The SRL lobe, in contrast, maintains its position during the entire cryo-EM map (green) has moved from its position in the crystal strucprocess (Fig. 5d).

the GAC and in contact with the aa-tRNA in the A/T site, reduces the GTPase activity of EF-Tu42. Additionally, the aforementioned effect of a mutation in G222 within EF-Tu on the GTP hydrolysis by the factor29,30 can now be explained, because an impaired interaction between EF-Tu and the 30S subunit (established through this particular residue) would leave the factor without a necessary anchor point on the ribosome to maintain a stable position while the aa-tRNA moves following the movement of the GAC. It is remarkable that the GAC, a part of the 50S subunit, seems to have a pivotal role in the decoding of the mRNA, which resides on the small 30S subunit. Another element of the 50S subunit, LH69, seems to have an important function during this process as well. It is the only ribosomal element that interacts with the aa-tRNA close to the region where the distortion of the incoming aa-tRNA structure is seen in the present work. We have sought an integrated model that (i) would fit the observed interplay of interactions and conformational changes (ii) would explain the sequence of events during the delivery of aa-tRNA to the ribosome by EF-Tu and (iii) would give both the GAC and LH69 a prominent place. In our proposed model, the ternary complex, presumably in a conformation as defined by its crystal structures, approaches a ribosome that has its GAC lobe in the open conformation (Fig. 6b). Two of the contacts between the ternary complex and the ribosome that are seen in the kirromycin-stalled complex are maintained in this hypothetical constellation. These are the contact between EF-Tu and SRL and the contact between residue 1067 from the GAC and the elbow region of the aa-tRNA. The only contact with 23S rRNA that is absent, because of the leveraging of tRNA produced by the different orientation of the GAC lobe, is the contact of the tRNA D loop with nucleotide 1914 of LH69. We postulate that this contact, once established, increases the intrinsic flexibility of the tRNA structure and facilitates the reorientation of the ASL that is required for codon-anticodon contact. Thus, the conformational change of the GAC to the closed state, which leads to the crucial tRNA D loop contact with LH69 (Fig. 6c), may be seen as the start of a causal chain leading to codon-anticodon pairing (Fig. 6d). For the energy cost of tRNA deformation to be compensated, a cognate codon-anticodon pairing would be essential. A cognate tRNA will stabilize the closed GAC lobe conformation and conserve the relative movement between aa-tRNA and EF-Tu in the ternary complex, leading to rapid hydrolysis of GTP on EF-Tu. When, in contrast, the aa-tRNA is noncognate, its interaction with the codon will fail to stabilize the closed GAC lobe conformation and the structural rearrangement of the ternary complex, leading to slow GTP hydrolysis on EF-Tu11. The second selection of the specific aa-tRNA takes place after the hydrolysis of GTP and the dissociation of EF-Tu. The tRNA conformation in the A/T site that we observe is energetically unfavorable, which would explain why it has not been observed before in the structure of the isolated molecule. We suggest that after dissociation of EF-Tu and liberation of the acceptor arm from its interaction with the factor, the aa-tRNA will resume its energetically more favorable structure while maintaining the same codon-anticodon interaction. This means that the ASL will not change its position or orientation, so that the tension in the tRNA structure is resolved by a movement of the acceptor arm toward the A site in the 50S subunit (see Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 online). According to our model, the tRNA can be understood as a molecular spring, whose flexibility permits (i) codon recognition in the presence of EF-Tu and (ii) rapid movement of the CCA end of tRNA toward the A site on the 50S subunit. It is clear that if during the movement of the aa-tRNA from the A/T to the A site, the interaction between codon and anticodon is not strong enough, the aa-tRNA will dissociate from the ribosome. Thus, in addition to explaining the steps of codon-anticodon interaction and accommodation of a cognate tRNA, our model would provide a ready explanation for the structural basis of proofreading of near-cognate tRNAs. METHODS
Preparation of ribosomal complexes. All the ribosomal samples were prepared using an in vitro translation system in polymix buffer43. For the 70S­tRNAfMet­MF-tRNAPhe complex, an initiation mix (200 µl), containing 4.4 µM ribosomes, 1.5 µM each IF1, IF2 and IF3, 12.5 µM MFstop-mRNA, 14.1 µM fMet-tRNAfMet, energy regeneration system (50 ng µl­1 PK, 1 mM GTP and 2 mM PEP), was incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. An elongation mix (200 µl), containing 21.2 µM [14C]Phe, 20 µM [14C]Ile, 21.8 µM tRNAPhe, 29 µM EF-Tu, 12.5 µM EF-Ts, 90 U of Phe-tRNA synthetase, an energy regeneration system (50 ng µl­1 PK, 1 mM GTP, 2 mM PEP, 8 ng µl­1 MK, 1 mM ATP) was incubated separately at 37 °C for 15 min. Peptide elongation was started by adding together the initiation and elongation mixtures. After 15 s incubation at 37 °C, the mixture was diluted with ice-cold polymix buffer to 1 µM ribosomal concentration and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The occupancy of A site, which was determined as the amount of peptide that could be released by RF1 in a stop codon­dependent reaction after fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe translocation with addition of EF-G, was >75% of ribosome. The release of peptide was detected by filtration of the mixture through nitrocellulose. No detectable A site tRNA was translocated without EF-G. In addition, HPLC analysis showed that >90% of the A site­bound tRNA carried the dipeptide. To prepare the 70S­fMet-tRNAfMet­Phe-tRNAPhe­EF-Tu­GDP­kir complex, 0.25 mM kirromycin was added into the elongation mixture. No detectable Phe-tRNAPhe was translocated when EF-G was added to this complex. To prepare the control ribosomal complex with fMet-tRNAfMet in the P site, a mix (400 µl) containing 2.8 µM E. coli ribosomes, 0.75 µM each IF1, IF2 and IF3, 5.6 µM M stopmRNA, 6.3 µM fMet-tRNAfMet, energy regeneration system (100 ng µl­1 PK, 1 mM GTP and 6 mM PEP) was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Then the complex was pelleted in the airfuge (Beckman Coulter) for 15 min at 100,000 rpm (199,000g), dissolved in 600 µl of polymix buffer and frozen in liquid nitrogen. To prepare samples for cryo-EM, an aliquot of the ribosomal complex was thawed on ice and diluted with ice-cold polymix buffer to 32 nM concentration of ribosome. More than 70% of the ribosomal P site was occupied with fMet-tRNAfMet, as detected by scintillation counting of [3H]fMet. Cryo-electron microscopy and image processing. The solutions containing ribosomal complexes were diluted in the same polymix buffer to a final concentration of 32 nM. Grids for cryo-EM were prepared following standard procedures. Micrographs were collected on a Philips Tecnai F20 at 200 kV and a magnification of 50,000× (± 2%) in low-dose conditions. After scanning the micrographs on a Zeiss Imaging scanner (Z/I Imaging Corporation) with a step size of 14 µm, the final pixel size corresponded to 2.82 Å on the object scale. The image processing included a 3D projection alignment procedure with correction of the contrast transfer function and enhancement of the high-resolution Fourier amplitudes based on X-ray solution scattering data. The total numbers of particles used in the final cryo-EM maps were 75,996 for the 70S­fMettRNAfMet­Phe-tRNAPhe­EF-Tu­GDP­kir sample, 52,181 for the 70S­ tRNAfMet­MF-tRNAPhe complex and 19,865 individual particles for the 70S­fMet-tRNAfMet control. The resolution for the maps was estimated to be 9 Å, 9 Å and 11 Å, respectively, using a cutoff of 0.15 in the Fourier shell correlation, equivalent to a 0.5 figure of merit in X-ray crystallography44, and the maps were low-pass filtered accordingly. The cutoffs of 0.5 and 3  in the FSC corresponded to resolutions of 10.25 Å and 7.5 Å in the cases of the 70S­fMettRNAfMet­Phe-tRNAPhe­EF-Tu­GDP­kir and 70S­tRNAfMet­MF-tRNAPhe, and 14 Å and 9 Å for the control. The density thresholds that defined the rendered boundaries were chosen to display the approximate dimensions of published ribosomal atomic structures, and the final volumes represent 120­140% the calculated volume for the ribosome. The segmentation of the 3D maps was carried out by cluster analysis using control maps of ligand-free ribosomes. Docking of atomic structures and modeling the A/T site tRNA. The docking of X-ray structures into the cryo-EM maps was made manually using O45, and the visualization was carried out in IRIS Explorer, RIBBONS and Insight II LS

(Accelrys). The estimated accuracy of the fittings within the density maps is ±1 Å, as checked by cross-correlation traces. The coordinates of the ribosomal proteins and rRNAs were taken from published atomic structures (PDB entry 1FFK for the 50S subunit from Ban and co-workers26; 1IBM for the 30S subunit from Ogle and co-workers21), and the docking was done using the coordinates as rigid bodies. Coordinates from R.C.N. and co-workers (PDB entry 1OB2; unpublished data) were used for the docking of EF-Tu and aa-tRNA in the cryo-EM density for the ternary complex. The model for the A/T site tRNA was constructed by interpolating between the tRNA positions for two independent fittings of the tRNA into the cryo-EM density. In one position, model A, the tRNA (PDB entry 1OB2) was fitted such that the T/acceptor stem came to lie in its corresponding density, but the anticodon stem was outside the density. In the second position, model B, the anticodon was fitted to the density while the T/acceptor stem was allowed to stick out. To create a model in which both domains fit in the density, we did a linear interpolation in which the T/acceptor stem was held fixed for model A, and the anticodon was held fixed in model B. The positions for the remaining atoms were determined by interpolating between the two models in a smooth and continuous fashion. The resulting model was subjected to an energy minimization to convergence using steepest descent minimization and the AMBER force field46 in the Insight II package. Coordinates. For the A/T state, the following coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank: A/T-site tRNA (modeled) (1QZA); EF-Tu (R.C.N. et al., unpublished data) (1OB2) fitted into ribosome environment (1QZD); GAC in closed position (1R2X). For the accommodated state, the following coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank: A-site tRNA (1QZB) and GAC in open position (1R2W). The ribosomal environment is represented by the elements SH44, protein S12, LH69 and SRL (jointly deposited as 1QZC). The cryo-EM density maps of the ribosomal complexes in the A/T (AMD-1055) and the accommodated state (EMD-1056) have been deposited in the 3D-EM database, EMBL-European Bioinformation Institute.
