Quantum mechanical effects in enzyme-catalysed hydrogen transfer reactions

Hydrogen tunneling at room temperature has recently been demonstrated in the reactions catalysed by yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and bovine serum amine oxidase.

As illustrated, superposition of a wave property onto the reactant ground state vibrational level leads to a finite probability that reactant will be found in the product well at energies far below those of the barrier height (Fig. 2b). Thus, quantum mechanical effects may be expected to contribute to, and in some cases dominate, simple hydrogen transfer processes.

The latter two features are contradictory, showing, respectively: a reactant-like transition state from the small effect of electronic substituent on rate [p+(ko) < < p+(Keq)]; and a product-like transition state from the magnitude of secondary isotope effects (~tko u / u k o 1" = 0tKeq tt/0tKcq T) (summarized in Eqn 1 at foot of page).

These results demonstrated that simple models, in which ct secondary kinetic isotope effects are predicted to vary from unity to equilibrium values as the structure of the transition state proceeds from reactant-like to product-like II, cannot apply to the reactions catalysed by dehydrogenases.

overcome by the introduction of a tunnel correction. In fact, these authors achieved successful modeling of the experimental data on liver alcohol dehydrogenase by assigning 80% of the protium-transfer process to a tunneling event!
Experimental verification Given the provocative development of ideas summarized above, a major challenge has been to identify the appropriate experimental probe(s) for a systematic and definitive demonstration of hydrogen tunneling in enzyme systems. With regard to reactions in solution, the most frequently cited evidence in support of tunneling has been (1) very large primary isotope effects (kH/kD > 10), and (2) anomalous isotope effects on Arrhenius pre-exponential factors (AH/AD < 0.7, or > 1.3) (Ref, 14). These criteria are clearly unsuited to the demonstration of tunneling in dehydrogenases, given the relatively small magnitudes of primary isotope effects (ku/kD = 3-5). Superficially, this could be taken as evidence against tunneling. An important breakthrough occurred with the theoretical study of Saunders 15, demonstrating that the semi-classical relationship between D/T and H/T isotope effects would break down significantly under conditions of tunneling. In the absence of quantum effects, the interplay of these ratios is constrained by reduced mass considerations, such that

For an initial foray into the application of Saunder's method to an enzyme reaction, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase was chosen as the model system - given the existing evidence for anomalous secondary isotope effects and the ability to isolate kinctically the hydride transfer step. Relatively little work has been reported for D/T isotope effects, which are more difficult to carry out than the common H / T measurements; as noted in Cha et al. 16, the investigation of D/T effects requires great care in the synthesis of labeled substrates, since the presence of hydrogen contamination in deuterated samples leads to inflated, time-dependent isotope effects which will obscure the relationship in Eqn 3. In the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase reaction the use of double labeling (14C to trace the course of deuterated or protonated substrate, and 3H to trace the course of the heavier isotope) permitted experimental error on measured isotope effects to be reduced to < 2%, leading to the relationships shown in Eqns 4 and 5 t,.

Primarv isotope effects: (ko/kT) 326 = (klt/kT) calc = 5.91+-0.20 < (kn/kT) obs = 7.13+-0.07 (4) Secondary isotope effects: ( k l ) / k T ) 32~' = ( ku/kT) calc = 1.11+_0.02 < (ku/kr) obs = 1.35_+0.015 (5)
As can be seen, the relationship between calculated and observed (H/T) isotope effects is in precisely the direction predicted for hydrogen tunneling! The values of the exponent required to 'match' measured D/T and H / T isotope effects are 3.58 +- 0.09 for primary effects and 10.2+2.4 for secondary isotope effects, both of which are well outside a theoretical upper limit of 3.34 for isotope effects arising purely from semi-classical origins. The marked breakdown in secondary D/T and H/T effects from a semi-classical relationship provides a striking confirmation of coupled motion between the primary and secondary hydrogens of substrate, reflecting the propagation of tunneling from the primary position to the non-transferred, secondary hydrogen atom.
Further proof While the new findings on yeast alcohol dehydrogenase are quite exciting, it is important to question their generality. Are these results an isolated phenomenon or can we expect to

isotope effects can only occur via a concomitant decrease in the magnitude of the primary isotope effect. As shown by Huskey and Schowen J3 in 1983, the discrepancy between computed and experimental primary isotope effects can be

This relationship can easily be understood in the context of the mass dependence of tunneling, since the tunnel probability shows the dependence of H > D > T. An especially critical consideration is whether Eqn 3 could arise artifactually in the case of kinetic complexity, a common and often vexing feature of enzyme-catalysed reactions. As shown recently by Cha et al, 16, multiple rate-limiting steps lead, in fact, to the opposite prediction, with

encounter tunneling as a regular property of enzyme-catalysed hydrogen transfer reactions? To obtain more data, a second enzyme to investigate was required and bovine serum amine oxidase appeared to be an ideal choice. (1) In contrast to the hydride transfer reactions of dehydroge#ases, this enzyme catalyses a proton abstraction reaction 17 (see Eqn 6 at top of page); where cofactor (ox) and cofactor (red) are believed to correspond to the oxidized and reduced forms of covalently bound pyrroloquinoline quinone is. (2) Bovine serum amine oxidase displays some of the largest primary isotope effects observed in an enzyme reaction, with ku/kT = 35 (at 25 ° C), :in excess of the semi-classical limit of 27 (Ref. 19). Given the very large magnitude of kH/k,r, we were encouraged to pursue the temperature dependence of isotope effects as a measure of tunneling. Following extensive theoretical and experimental protocols, the temperature dependence of the isotope effect can be formulated in the context of the Arrhenius equation:
l n ( k t / k T ) = In(AI/A.r)

bovine serum amine oxidase reaction 19, are summarized in Table I. The magnitude of Arrhenius parameters for primary isotope effects is striking, showing a dramatic deviation from semi-classical limits in the direction predicted for tunneling! In fact, a similar deviation from semi-classical behavior is seen with both H / T and D / T effects, implicating a large degree of deuterium as well as protium tunneling. Since we are dealing with a complex enzyme reaction it appeared important to question whether the data in Table I could arise artifactually from more than one kinetically significant step. Several authors have pointed out that anomalous values for AH/AT can arise in multistep reactions such as Eqn 8: k~ k3 E + S ~,_-~_ E.S---, E.p k2

where L is either H or D. Under conditions of thermal activation, the magnitude of AIJAT will be close to unity with the magnitude of Ea(T) - Ea(L) equal to or less than limits of 8-9 kJ mol -~ lEa(T) - Ea(H)], and 2-2 kJ mo1-1 [Ea(T) - Ea(D)]. Under conditions of moderate quantum mechanical tunneling, however, the magnitude of both parameters is predicted to breakdown appreciably with AL/AT becoming inverse and Ea(T) - Ea(H) exceeding its semi-classical limits. Of particular note is the magnitude of the isotope effect on the Arrhenius preexponential factor, which ~eflects the higher tunneling probability for L than T at intermediate temperatures and hence, a greater curvature in Arrhenius plots. As illustrated in Fig. 4, extrapolation of experimental data measured within a limited temperature range leads to an apparent crossing of kT by kLandAL/AT< 1 (Ref. 14). Experimental values for AL/AT and Ea(T) - Ea(L), obtained from plots of In (kH/kT) and In (kD/k~) vs. 1/T in the

For example, Koch and Dahlberg 2~ simulated inverse values for AH/AD as low as 0.32 under the condition of k2/k3 = 0.56 and A2/A3 = 0.1. In such instances, however, expressed isotope effects become suppressed due to the presence of more than one rate-limiting step, falling significantly below the semi-classical limit, It appears that the combination of very large primary isotope effects and values for AL/AT < < 1 cannot be explained by semi-classical effects, providing direct evidence for hydrogen tunneling. As one further test of kinetic complexity in the bovine serum amine oxidase reaction, the magnitude of kinetic isotope effects measured by stopped flow, k3 in Eqn 8, was compared to those seen in the steady state (klk3/k2+k3). These studies have indicated identical effects in the temperature range 15°-45°C, demonstrating that k2 > > k3 (Ref. 19).

investigation of tunneling and both have found to exhibit quantum mechanical behavior*. This may reflect beginner's luck or the careful choice of appropriate enzyme systems to characterize. An alternative view is that hydrogen tunneling is a fundamental and pervasive feature of enzyme-catalysed hydrogen transfer reactions. We do not yet know whether quantum mechanical behavior is more frequent in an enzyme active site than in solution, but we have several reasons to suspect that this may be the case. First, as noted in the introduction, binding of substrates to enzymes leads to desolvation of the active site, with active site side chains taking on the roles normally assumed by the solvent in solution chemistry (e.g. hydrogen bonding, stabilization of charged intermediates/ transition states, etc.). Since enzymes are, by definition, complementary to their substrates in the activated complex 23, little structural reorganization of side chains may occur concomitant with bond cleavage processes. This is in marked contrast to our view of solution chemistry, where solvent reorganization is believed to be a major component of reaction coordinates. As noted by others, incorporation of solvent motion into the reaction coordinate leads to an increased mass for the transferred particle and a lower probability for quantum mechanical effects 14. A second feature which may promote tunneling in enzyme active sites is the magnitude of the internal equilibrium, constant for the conversion of bound substrate(s) to product. A number of enzyme systems have been shown to be characterized by values for I I

achieving an appropriate distance for hydrogen transfer to occur. Turning to the bovine serum amine oxidase reaction, its properties appear more similar to those traditionally associated with reactions characterized by hydrogen tunneling. As summarized in Table I, the magnitude of primary tritium isotope effects exceeds semiclassical limits and the temperature dependence of these isotope effects indicates highly anomalous values for AL/AT and Ea(T) - Ea(L). It is especially interesting that the same anomalies in Arrhenius plots have been detected in measurements of D/T isotope effects as in H / T measurements, demonstrating that deuterium, as well as protium tunneling, undergoes substantial tunneling. Somewhat unexpectedly, the reduced mass breakdown (Eqn 3) seen in the alcohol dehydrogenase reaction has not been observed with bovine serum amine oxidase. As discussed by Grant and Klinman l~J, these collective properties suggest a high degree of hydrogen tunneling in the reaction catalysed by bovine serum amine oxidase ~. Despite this conclusion, a very substantial enthalpy of activation has been measured ~'~ for the proton abstraction step, Ea(H) = 56 kJ tool 1. Since hydrogen tunneling from the ground state vibrational level of the C - H bond of substrate (Fig. 2a) will be temperature independent, the large magnitude of Ea(H) may reflect tunneling from higher energy states closer to the top of the energy barrier. Alternatively, it is possible that the measured enthaipy reflects a temperature-dependent change in protein structure, which is a prerequisite for subsequent ground state tunneling. Recent theoretical studies by Bruno and Bialek (pers. commun.) support the latter view, since these investigators have been able to fit the experimental data for bovine serum amine oxidase using a model for tunneling in which all of the temperature dependence arises from protein motion.

Kcq(im) close to unity 24-25, deviating substantially from the equilibrium constant representing the interconversion of free substrates and products in solution, Keq(cxt). It has been shown that the probability for hydrogen tunneling increases enormously when the energy of the potential energy wells representing reactant and product are identical, referred to as resonant tunneling 2~'. In more general models ~4, the frequency of tunneling is also expected to peak when Kcq ~ 1, although its dependence on the magnitude of K~.q is much less severe than under conditions of 'resonance'. Although it is difficult to conceive of many enzyme reactions that achieve the exact degeneracy required for resonant tunneling (with the possible exception of racemases), a perturbation of Keq(mt) toward unity may be expected to increase the overall probability of hydrogen tunneling. Finally, some mention should be made of the effect of the distance between the donor and acceptor atoms at an enzyme active site. Virtually all models for tunneling incorporate a dependence of the tunneling probability on the hydrogen transfer distance. To the extent that very close packing can be achieved between two bound substrates or between a bound substrate and a catalytic side chain due both to solvent exclusion and to highly specific protein-substrate interactions - tunneling probabilities may be increased relative to analogous reactions in bulk solvent.
Nature of enzyme catalysis

What does the new evidence for hydrogen tunneling in the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and bovine serum amine oxidase reactions reveal about the nature of enzyme catalysis? At the outset, these results permit us to rule out catalytic mechanisms that require a direct coupling of motion in the protein backbone to bond cleavage processes. Such a coupling is expected to produce enormous increases in the mass of the reaction coordinate and very low tunneling probabilities.

An examination of the available data for yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and bovine serum amine oxidase indicates markedly different evidence in support of tunneling. With regard to the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase reaction, the experimental data reveal small isotope effects and normal Arrhenius behavior, such that values of Ea(T) - Ea(L) and An~AT lie within the semi-classical range ~. It is the relative values of the H / T and D/T isotope effects - showing a marked deviation from semi-classical reduced mass considerations (Eqns 4 and 5) - that provide evidence for tunneling. It is important to note that the derivation of Saunder's relationship (Eqn 3) assumes only moderate amounts of hydrogen tunneling, with reaction rates reflecting a balance between thermally activated over the barrier hydrogen transfer events and tunneling Is. To a first approximation, this view appears to be quite a reasonable one for the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase reaction coordinate, providing a context for future modeling of reaction barrier shape and for a quantitate estimation of quantum mechanical effects t. It will be of considerable interest to compare the results of such modeling to the available X-ray structures on dehydrogenases. Both horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase 27'2s and dihydrofolate reductase 2'~ have been characterized at high resolution, indicating distances between C-1 of substratc and C-4 of nicotinamide cofactor of ~ 3.5-3.6 A. These distances are much too long for effective hydrogen transfer (where distances Ol 2.8 A are anticipated), indicating that thermal motion of the protein in solution must be playing a role in

~Thc presence of coupled motion between the primary and secondary hydrogens of substrate in the yeast alcohol dchydrogenase reaction may be responsible, in part, for the presence of only moderate amounts of tunneling. Such coupling is expected to increase the effective mass of the hydrogen undergoing transfer, leading to a concomitant reduction in the probability of tunneling.

Despite the success of recent studies in demonstrating hydrogen tunneling, additional types of enzyme-catalysed
Hn contrast to ycast alcohol dehydrogcnasc, there is no evidence for coupled motion between the primary and secondary hydrogens of snbstrate in the amine oxidase reaction. This may be a factor in a greater expression of quantum mechanical behavior.

hydrogen transfer reactions need to be studied, in order to test the generality of this new p h e n o m e n o n . It would also be of considerable interest to know if particles heavier than protium and deuterium display quantum mechanical behavior in enzyme reactions at room temperature. With regard to modeling, this represents an extremely important aspect of the problem. It is expected that successful fitting of experimental data will provide unique insights into the shape of reaction coordinates, as well as the role of protein dynamics, in enzyme catalysis.

Poly(A), poly(A) binding protein and the regulation of mRNA stability
Philip Bernstein and Jeffrey Ross
Gene expression can be controlled by changing the half-lifes of specific m R N A s in response to intracellular events or to extracellular stimuli. Many experiments suggest that m R N A turnover in mammalian cells is linked to poly(A) metabolism, which might be affected by the efficiency of the cytoplasmic poly (A ) binding protein in protecting poly (A ) from nucleolytic attack.

Most newly synthesized m R N A s are modified post-transcriptionally by the addition of a poly(A) tract at their 3' termini. Although the detailed mechanisms of poly(A) synthesis are being elucidated, the functions of poly(A) are not fully understood. The poly(A) tract might have multiple functions, both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm: it might play a role in the processing and transport of m R N A (for :review see

Ref. 1); it affects the translational efficiency of m R N A s , particularly in lower eukaryotes2; and it seems to influence m R N A turnover. This review will focus on the potential role of poly(A) and its associated poly(A) binding protein (PABP) in determining the half-lifes of mRNAs. Poly(A) can influence m R N A stability Most of the data regarding poly(A) and m R N A metabolism suggests that poly(A) can protect m R N A from rapid destruction. Some initial evidence came from experiments showing the time-dependent shortening of poly(A) tracts. For example, the poly(A) tracts

of newly synthesized globin m R N A molecules in splenic erythroid cells contain approximately 150 adenylate (A) residues, which are progressively shortened to 40-60 As (Ref. 3). This and other experiments were not designed to show a direct cause and effect relationship between poly(A) shortening and m R N A turnover, but they did indicate a strong correlation between the two. In subsequent experiments the halflifes of an m R N A with or without its poly(A) tract were compared directly. Rabbit globin m R N A s containing poly(A) tracts of varying lengths were co-injected with radiolabeled histidine into Xenopus oocytes 4. The functional stability (ability to be translated) of each m R N A preparation was then determined by measuring the time span over which globin protein was synthesized. In this assay m R N A molecules with poly(A) tracts containing 32 or more A residues have the same functional stability as m R N A s with 150 As. In contrast, the stability of the same m R N A with only 16 As is at least tenfold lower and is close to that of fully deadenylated m R N A . Nudel and colleagues reasoned that the functional stability of each m R N A is directly related to its structural stability, since the translational efficiency of deadenylated m R N A is the same as that of its
