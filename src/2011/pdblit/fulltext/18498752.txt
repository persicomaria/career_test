In Drosophila Pygopus (Pygo) and Legless (Lgs)/BCL9 are integral components of the nuclear Wnt/Wg signaling machine. Despite intense research, ideas that account for their mode of action remain speculative. One proposition, based on a recently discovered function of PHD fingers, is that Pygo, through its PHD, may decipher the histone code. We found that human, but not Drosophila, Pygo robustly interacts with a histone-H3 peptide methylated at lysine-4. The different binding behavior is due to a single amino acid change that appears unique to Drosophilidae Pygo proteins. Rescue experiments with predicted histone binding mutants showed that in Drosophila the ability to bind histones is not essential. Further experiments with Pygo­Lgs fusions instead demonstrated that the crucial role of the PHD is to provide an interaction motif to bind Lgs. Our results reveal an interesting evolutionary dichotomy in Pygo structure­function, as well as evidence underpinning the chain of adaptors model. Ó 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction

Wingless (Wg)/WNT signaling occurs via an evolutionary conserved pathway that plays a fundamental role throughout the life of an organism. At the heart of Wnt target gene regulation lies a nuclear complex that is scaffolded by b-catenin/ Armadillo (Arm) (Mosimann et al., 2009). Two regions of Arm/b-catenin are critical for this function: a N-terminal branch and the C-terminal tail (Orsulic and Peifer, 1996). The C-terminal tail serves as an interaction surface for the recruitment of a diverse set of complexes involved in histone modification, transcriptional initiation and elongation (Sta¨ deli et al., 2006; Xu and Kimelman, 2007). The function of the N-terminal branch is mediated by the transcriptional potential inherent in the N-terminal Homology Domain (NHD) of Pygopus (Pygo). The term ``chain of adaptors'' was coined to describe the recruitment of Pygo (via Legless (Lgs), Arm and Pan/dTCF) to

Wg target genes (Stadeli and Basler, 2005). Lgs/BCL9 contains ¨ two conserved domains that are essential for this function ­ HD2 (homology domain 2) which mediates the interaction with Arm/b-catenin and HD1 which binds to the PHD of Pygo (Kramps et al., 2002). Reductionist studies in Drosophila led to the notion that the sole function of Lgs/BCL9 is to serve as an adaptor between its two partners (Kramps et al., 2002; Stadeli ¨ and Basler, 2005). A more recent study (Sustmann et al., 2008) ascribed additional activities to domains conserved in mammalian BCL9 orthologs, suggesting that they may have evolved new functions. The modus operandi of Pygo, in particular the mechanism of action of the NHD, has been fertile ground for speculation (Jessen et al., 2008): the chain of adaptors model in which the Pygo NHD recruits a factor(s) with transcriptional activator function (Hoffmans et al., 2005; Stadeli and Basler, 2005; ¨ Thompson, 2004); a nuclear retention model in which Pygo functions as a nuclear anchor targeting Arm/b-catenin to

the nucleus (Townsley et al., 2004); a refinement of the anchor model in which Pygo functions at the onset of Wnt signaling, or at low signaling levels, to specifically capture Arm at Pan/ dTCF target genes (de la Roche and Bienz, 2007). Another possible mechanism of action for Pygo was raised by the discovery that PHD fingers can act as ``code-readers'' for localizing protein complexes to gene loci in particular transcriptional states, ranging from inactive (unmethylated H3K4) (Lan et al., 2007) to actively transcribed (H3K4me3) (Li et al., 2006; Pena et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2006; Wysocka et al., 2006). We set out to investigate if this putative interaction could occur and if it is functionally required. We observed that hPygo, but not dPygo, robustly binds histones. The difference is due to a single amino acid change present in the PHD of all Drosophilidae Pygo proteins. In vivo studies demonstrated that in Drosophila even if there were an inherent ability to bind histones in the dPygoPHD it is not essential for its function. Experiments with Pygo­Lgs fusions instead showed that the key role of the dPygoPHD is as an adaptor motif to bind Lgs ­ creating a link in the chain of adaptors. In sum the results highlight a novel evolutionary dichotomy in Pygo structure­function, as well as providing new evidence underpinning the chain of adaptors model.

hanced by the binding of a peptide corresponding to the HD1 of Lgs. We also observed that the presence of a HD1 peptide enhanced the Pygo-H3K4 interaction (Fig. 2B). HD1 binding to hPygo2 enhanced the interaction with H3K4me (Fig. 2B). In the presence of HD1, Drosophila Pygo also detectably interacted with the H3 peptide; however, the binding was independent of the K4 methylation state (Fig. 2B). This contrasts with Fiedler et al., 2008 who reported no detectable binding by dPygo to the unmethylated peptide. The HD1 peptide is 34 aa; full-length Lgs and BCL9 are 1400 aa. The binding of the peptide may therefore not recapitulate the binding of full-length Lgs. We were unable to generate recombinant full-length Lgs/BCL9 to resolve this issue; however, we could generate a truncated version: GST-BCL9 1­300 (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the peptide, BCL9 1­300 abrogated binding of hPygo to H3K4me3 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, we did not see a strong effect on the binding to H3K4me2. These results suggest Lgs/BCL9 competes with histones for binding to Pygo. However, variables, such as post-translation modifications and other Lgs/BCL9 binding partners (e.g. Arm), may alter this situation ­ again enabling binding or also inhibiting it. Since these factors cannot easily be tested in a biochemical approach we decided to directly test the importance of histone binding in vivo.

Results
hPygo strongly binds to H3K4me2, dPygo does not 2.2. Histone binding is not required in vivo

Some PHD fingers, by binding lysine-4 on histone 3 (H3K4), seem to help the proteins containing them to orchestrate gene expression (Mellor, 2006; Ruthenburg et al., 2007). Does the PygoPHD have a similar modus operandi? We found that the PHD of human Pygo2 (hPygo2PHD) bound methylated K4 but not methylated K9 (Fig. 1B). As seen for hPygo1PHD (Fiedler et al., 2008), the hPygo2PHD had a preference for dimethylated K4 (K4me2); in contrast the dNURF301PHD binds K4me3 better (Fig. 1C, (Wysocka et al., 2006)). Unexpectedly we did not see a convincing interaction between the dPygoPHD and H3K4me2/3 (Fig. 1B). Based on the ability of dPygoPHD preparations to bind Lgs we excluded mis-folding as a trivial explanation for the lack of binding (Fig. 3C). To try to understand why dPygo and hPygo2 behaved differently we examined more closely the PHD sequence. One of the aromatic residues building the so-called K4 cage (Li et al., 2007a; Nakamura et al., 2007) is not conserved in Drosophila: hPygo2-W353 vs dPygo-F773 (Fig. 1A). The tryptophan (W), which separates the two pockets for K4 and A1/R2 (Fiedler et al., 2008; Nakamura et al., 2007), is present in PHD fingers that are known to bind methylated histones (Fig. 1A and (Ruthenburg et al., 2007)). Substituting the W for phenylalanine (F) in hPygo2 and dNURF301 abrogated detectable binding (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1). In the converse experiment, replacing the F of dPygo with W (F773W) enabled binding to H3K4me2/3 (Fig. 1D and data not shown). One interpretation of the above results is that histone binding is not functionally important, at least in Drosophilidae where the crucial W is not conserved (Fig. S2). However, an exciting caveat was proposed by Fiedler et al. (2008) ­ the binding of Pygo to methylated H3K4 (H3K4me) peptides is en-

Previous structural studies had shown that altering residues in the so-called K4 cage abolish the PHD­histone interaction (Fiedler et al., 2008; Li et al., 2006; Pena et al., 2006; Wysocka et al., 2006). Consistent with these reports, mutation of a conserved tyrosine found in the K4 cage effectively abrogated binding to H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 (hPygo2-Y328A, Fig. 3A and data not shown). A simultaneous effect on Lgs and histone binding would confound interpretation since for such a mutant a loss of function is also predicted by the chain of adaptors model. We therefore wanted to confirm that dPygo-Y748A (corresponds to hPygo2-Y328A) can still bind Lgs. In co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown experiments Y748A was able to bind Lgs (Fig. 3B and C). Conversely, the L789A mutation abolishes Lgs binding but had no effect on histone binding (Fig. 3A­C). To investigate the biological importance of H3K4 binding we introduced the following mutations: Y748A, A763E, and F773E (and combinations thereof) into a genomic rescue construct of dPygo (Fig. 4A and B). Mutations equivalent to A763E and F773E in hPygo1 abolish histone binding (Fiedler et al., 2008, Fig. S2A shows the corresponding residues in hPygo1, hPygo2 and dPygo). The constructs were all integrated into the landing site located at cytological position 51D using the attP integration system (Bischof et al., 2007). We then tested if these transgenes could rescue pygoS123.3/pygoEB130 or pygoEB130/pygoEB130 flies. pygoS123.3 has a deletion that only leaves amino acids 1­51 intact (Thompson et al., 2002) and pygoEB130 has a deletion starting at amino acid 751, leading to a truncated PHD finger (Kramps et al., 2002).

The Lgs binding mutant (L789A) was unable to rescue homozygous mutant animals (Fig. 4B). Four proteins with modifications that abolish H3K4 binding (Y748A, A763E, Y748A/A763E, Y748A/F773E) rescued mutant animals as efficiently as the wild-type protein. Underscoring the functionality of these modified forms, we also obtained phenotypically normal progeny at the expected ratio when we crossed the rescued animals (both females and males) to pygoEB130/TM6b animals. In the rescued animals the only

source of functional Pygo (including the germline source) was from the transgene. Similar conclusions can be drawn from a complementary experiment in Drosophila S2 cells in which we knocked down endogenous dPygo by RNAi and attempted to restore Pygo function by expressing wildtype hPygo2 or a mutant thereof (Fig. S3). The Y328A mutant was able to compensate for the loss of dPygo whereas the Lgs binding mutant (L369A) was inactive.

(B) The presence of the HD1 peptide enhances the PHD­histone interaction. (C) Larger Lgs/BCL9 fragments impede the PHD­histone interaction. A five to ten times molar excess was used.

Interestingly, we found one histone binding mutant that could not rescue pygo loss of function: dPygo-V757E (Fig. 4 and Fig. S3). It was this mutant that was used by Fiedler et al. (2008) to establish the in vivo relevance of a Pygo­histone interaction. While not conclusive, the following data indicate a caveat that complicates the interpretation of this mutant. When expressed in cells the levels of dPygo-V757E were reproducibly lower (Fig. 3B). Although in co-immunoprecipitation experiments it was able to bind Lgs, purified dPygoPHDV757E was unable to bind Lgs (Fig. 3B and C). Our interpretation is that the V757E mutation affects the folding/stability of the PHD.

2.3.

HD1-PHD: an essential link in the chain of adaptors

The above results indicate that histone binding is not required for Pygo activity. Another function of the PHD is as a Lgs binding motif. If, in Drosophila, the sole essential role of the PHD is Lgs binding then the PHD should be dispensible in the context of a Pygo­Lgs fusion protein. To interrogate this idea we generated such fusion proteins and examined their

ability to rescue pygo, lgs and pygo/lgs mutant animals (Fig. 4C, detailed results are presented in Fig. S4). Importantly in an improvement on previous work (Kramps et al., 2002) the fusion proteins were expressed under the control of the endogenous pygo promoter and were all integrated at the same genetic locus. A fusion of Pygo and a minimal Lgs fragment (HD1 and HD2) was able to rescue pygo and lgs mutant animals, as well as the pygo/lgs double mutant animals (Fig. 4C). In the context of this fusion, deletion of the HD1 domain had no effect on the rescue ability in any of the experimental situations. However, the lgs mutant, lgs20F, has a point mutation that leads to an early stop codon after amino acid 383, consequently a HD1-containing protein could theoretically be produced. Since dPygo's interaction with histones might be improved by the binding of HD1, we wanted to exclude the possibility that the residual HD1, if indeed there is any, is affecting our results. To this end we introduced mutations in the PygoPHD to simultaneously abolish Lgsand H3K4-binding. This protein was fully functional. Deleting the HD2 abolished the ability to rescue animals in

These results suggest that in the context of a fusion protein the domains are dispensable; whereas the HD2 domain remains essential. These results are consistent with the chain of adaptors model, with the HD2 required to bind Arm and the PHD and HD1 recruiting the NHD of Pygo. If this is true then deleting both the PHD and the HD1 should have no effect on the ability of a Pygo­Lgs fusion to rescue a pygo/lgs double mutant. Such a minimal fusion, containing only the NHD and the HD2 domains, was able to rescue pygo, lgs and pygo/lgs mutant animals. If the PHD had any additional role then its complete removal would have been expected to affect the rescue ability ­ this was not observed. Taken together the results show that, in Drosophila, directly linking the PygoNHD to the LgsHD2 bypasses the need for the HD1 and the PHD. By extension even if a histone binding ability were inherent in the dPygoPHD this activity is not functionally important in Drosophila.

Discussion

We have carefully tested the idea that histone binding contributes to the function of Pygo. Our results demonstrate that in Drosophila the ability to bind H3K4me is not required for Pygo function. Instead our results suggest that the sole crucial function of the dPygoPHD finger is as a link in the chain of adaptors, which recruits the transcriptional activator potential of the NHD to Wg target genes. Our findings do not exclude that in other species histone binding by the PygoPHD has a functional importance. Indeed it is tempting to speculate that the different behavior of mam-

The efficiency was calculated: 100· (observed rescue)/(maximum expected rescue). Assuming all the genotypes that were possible in the cross had the same fitness, the maximum expected percentage of rescued animals mutant for pygo or lgs would account to 18.75% of the progeny; for the pygo and lgs double mutants the expected percentage is 6.25%.

malian and Drosophila Pygo with respect to histone binding accounts for their different requirement in vivo. In mice, where histone binding appears convincing, Pygo loss of function has a ``mild'' phenotype (reviewed in (Jessen et al., 2008), (Li et al., 2007b; Nair et al., 2008; Schwab et al., 2007; Song et al., 2007)). In Drosophila, where histone binding is appar-

ently absent, Pygo has a positive role that is reflected in a strong loss of function phenotype (Belenkaya et al., 2002; Kramps et al., 2002; Parker et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2002). Since the effect of Pygo loss of function in other organisms has not been documented, it remains unclear if mice represent the rule and Drosophila the exception, or vice versa.

If the conservation of the W in the K4 cage is an indication then Drosophila is the exception. One paradigm that would account for the observations is that Pygo has both positive and negative modes of action; histone binding providing the negative role. A possible mechanism for this model was suggested by Mosimann et al. (2009): Pygo binds H3K4me via its PHD finger. By using BCL9 as adaptor it can retain b-catenin in the proximity of a WRE independently of TCF. Pygo-dependent tethering of b-catenin to methylated histones frees TCF to recruit co-repressors (e.g. Groucho and CtBP), which then counteract the b-catenin-nucleated activating chromatin remodeling processes. However, this mechanism relies on the existence of a Histone/Pygo/BCL9 complex, which our results suggest may not form. Whatever the case, the demonstration that dPygo's role in Wg signaling can be reduced to the NHD suggests that its primary positive function lies in this domain (this study and (Hoffmans et al., 2005; Stadeli and Basler, 2005)). The list of ¨ transcriptional complexes which interact with the NHD is small but growing (Carrera et al., 2008; Wright and Tjian, 2009), a trend we predict will continue. Via the interaction of the PHD with HD1 of Lgs this polygamy of interactions is targeted to Wnt target genes. In this way Pygo may act cooperatively with the C-terminus of Arm/b-catenin ­ recruiting complexes required for Wg/Wnt target gene activation.

Materials and methods
Plasmid constructs and peptides

For generating GST-tagged PHD fingers for in vitro pulldown assays, dPygo(739­815), hPygo2(319­406), and dNURF301(2488­2567) were cloned into pGEX-KG (derived from pGEX-4T2). An EGFP tagged Lgs(231­555) construct was used as template for producing IVT. Biotinylated H3(1­21) peptides with the desired modification were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The peptides used for the competition experiments correspond to Lgs(315­348) and BCL9(174­207) (Kramps et al., 2002). A GST-BCL9(1­300) variant was cloned into pGEX-6P-1. All the rescue constructs analyzed in flies were based on a HA tagged genomic pygo construct (Stadeli and Basler, 2005). ¨ For the chimeric fusions, Lgs(273­605) was added C-terminally of the pygo CDS into an engineered MluI site. Mutant variants contain deletions of HD1(318­345) and/or HD2(508­ 550). The minimal NHD-HD2 rescue construct is composed of Pygo(1­303) and Lgs(358­605).

Approximately 4 · 106 Drosophila S2 cells were co-transfected using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) with 2 lg HA-tagged Lgs or BCL9 and with 2 lg V5-tagged dPygo, or a mutant variant of it. 48­72 h after transfection, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, Protease inhibitors). The lysate was incubated with 30 ll Protein A Sepharose, 0.8 ll antibody (mouse antiV5 (Invitrogen) or rabbit anti-HA (Santa Cruz, sc-805)) for 2 h at 4 °C. After binding, the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml lysis buffer. Immunoblotting was performed to reveal the presence of the co-precipitated protein.
