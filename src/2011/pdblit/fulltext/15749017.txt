Reconstitution of human telomerase activity in vitro
Tara L. Beattie*, Wen Zhou, Murray O. Robinson and Lea Harrington*
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that adds single-stranded telomere DNA to chromosome ends [1]. The RNA component of telomerase contains the template for telomeric DNA addition and is essential for activity [1,2]. Telomerase proteins have been identified in ciliates, yeast and mammals [3­12]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Est2 protein is homologous to the 123 kDa reverse transcriptase subunit of Euplotes telomerase, and is essential for telomerase activity [8]. In humans, telomerase activity is associated with the telomerase RNA hTR [13], the telomerase RNA-binding protein TP1/TLP1 [5,12] and the TP2 protein encoded by the human EST2 homolog [12] (also known as TRT1, hEST2 or TCS1 [9­11]). The minimal complex sufficient for activity is, however, unknown. We have reconstituted human telomerase activity in reticulocyte lysates and find that only exogenous hTR and TP2 are required for telomerase activity in vitro. Recognition of telomerase RNA by TP2 was species specific, and nucleotides 10­159 of hTR were sufficient for telomerase activity. Telomerase activity immunoprecipitated from the reticulocyte lysate contained hTR and recombinant TP2. Substitution of conserved amino acid residues in the reverse transcriptase domain of TP2 completely abolished telomerase activity. We suggest that TP2 and hTR might represent the minimal catalytic core of human telomerase.

Human TP2 protein and telomerase RNA reconstitute telomerase activity in reticulocyte lysates. (a) Results of telomerase assays. Lane 1, 5 µg HeLa cell lysate; lane 2, no template cDNA added; lane 3, TP2 cDNA only (0.1 µg translated in a 10 µl reticulocyte reaction); lanes 4­16, TP2 cDNA in the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated RNA species (0.001 µg, 0.01 µg, or 0.1 µg RNA per µl lysate): lanes 4­6, hTR RNA; lane 7, the same reaction in lane 6, preincubated with ribonuclease A (RNAse A) prior to the telomerase assay; lanes 8­10, antisense human telomerase RNA, hTR; lanes 11­13, transfer RNA, tRNA; lanes 14­16, full-length sense mouse telomerase RNA, mTR; lane 17, 0.1 µg hTR RNA only. (b) Each of the in vitro translation mixtures (approximately 2 µl) in (a) containing 0.001 µg/µl RNA was resolved by SDS­PAGE and analyzed by western blotting with 0.2 µg/ml anti-TP2 antiserum [12]. The position of a 116 kDa protein marker is indicated at the right, and that of the FLAG­TP2 fusion protein is indicated at the left (TP2). The 520nucleotide hTR (nucleotides 10­530) [13] was purified from a genomic hTR PCR product containing a T7 promoter, the antisense hTR using a T7 primer to the 3 end of hTR, and the mTR from a previously described plasmid [5]. Full-length TP2 cDNA containing sequences encoding the eight amino-acid FLAG epitope [12] was transcribed and translated using a Promega reticulocyte lysate (TNT) extract according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA preparation and telomerase assays (TRAP-EZE, Oncor Inc. [24]) were carried out at the Ontario Cancer Institute.

Results and discussion
Reconstitution of telomerase activity using hTR RNA and recombinant TP2 protein

The reconstitution of ciliate and human telomerases has been characterized using recombinant telomerase RNA in the presence of partially purified, micrococcal-nuclease-treated lysates [1,14], but the minimal protein composition of active human telomerase remains unknown.

Recently, we have functionally characterized TP2 as the catalytic subunit of human telomerase in human cells [12], and sought to determine whether recombinant TP2 could reconstitute human telomerase activity in vitro. We found that rabbit reticulocyte lysates did not contain endogenous telomerase activity (Figure 1a, lane 2), but telomerase activity could be detected when purified hTR RNA (nucleotides 10­530 of the hTR gene [13]) was

human telomerase described by Autexier et al. [14], activity was also reconstituted with hTR but not mTR. Western analysis of the lysates using an anti-TP2 antibody showed lower TP2 protein levels in the hTR sample compared with the samples containing inactive RNAs (Figure 1b), suggesting that the lack of telomerase activity in the latter samples was not due to lower TP2 protein levels. To rule out the possibility that high TP2 protein levels might inhibit telomerase activity, each purified RNA was mixed with a constant amount of TP2 that had been translated in a separate reaction, and the same results were obtained (data not shown). Therefore, TP2 can reconstitute telomerase activity in reticulocyte lysates and the reconstituted enzyme shows the same species-specific interaction with telomerase RNA as that seen with the native human enzyme [14].

Deletion analysis of hTR in the reconstitution assay. (a) A schematic representation is shown of the hTR truncations that were tested for the ability to reconstitute telomerase activity in the presence of full-length TP2 protein (the boxed region indicates the telomere template). The numbers refer to the positions of nucleotides within hTR [13]. Lanes 1,2, 5 µg HeLa cell lysate in the absence and presence of RNAse A; lane 3, TP2 cDNA only; lanes 4­13, TP2 in the presence of the indicated truncated hTR RNA species (0.01 µg or 0.1 µg RNA per µl lysate). (b) Each of the in vitro translation mixtures (approximately 2 µl) in (a) containing 0.1 µg/µl of the indicated RNA was analyzed by western blotting using 0.2 µg/ml anti-TP2 antiserum. The position of the TP2 protein is indicated at the left, and the protein markers, in kDa, at the right. The truncated hTR RNAs were generated by digestion of a 520-nucleotide hTR PCR product containing a 5 T7 promoter sequence with the following restriction enzymes: nucleotides 10­159, XbaI; nucleotides 10­205, SmaI, nucleotides 10­258, SacII; nucleotides 10­354, StuI.

In micrococcal-nuclease-treated human telomerase extracts, nucleotides 44­204 of hTR are sufficient to reconstitute telomerase activity, but nucleotides 44­170 are not [14]. We compared the activity of a number of hTR RNAs, truncated from the 3 end and lacking the first nine nucleotides, in the reticulocyte telomerase reconstitution assay (Figure 2a). All truncated RNAs, the shortest of which consisted of nucleotides 10­159, had detectable telomerase activity, although the shorter hTR RNAs showed reduced activity compared with an hTR RNA consisting of nucleotides 10­354 (Figure 2a). The levels of TP2 protein in the presence of the truncated RNAs were higher than in the presence of a 520-nucleotide hTR (nucleotides 10­530; Figure 2b); higher TP2 levels did not inhibit the reconstitution, however, because the activity with the hTR RNA consisting of nucleotides 10­354 was similar to that with the 520-nucleotide hTR. Therefore, nucleotides 10­159 of hTR are sufficient for telomerase activity in this assay. Our ability to detect activity with a shorter RNA in the reticulocyte lysate assay than in the micrococcal-nuclease reconstitution assay may reflect an increased reconstitution efficiency or the increased sensitivity of the PCR-based telomerase assay [14]. Therefore, the reconstituted telomerase enzyme requires a similar region of the hTR RNA as does the native human telomerase.
hTR and TP2 are the only limiting and necessary components for activity in vitro

added at the onset of transcription and translation of a full-length TP2 cDNA [12] (Figure 1a, lanes 4­6). Telomerase activity was not detected in the presence of either hTR RNA or TP2 protein alone (Figure 1a, lanes 3,17). TP2 protein in the presence of antisense hTR (hTR), transfer RNA (tRNA) or mouse telomerase RNA (mTR) [15] did not reconstitute telomerase activity (Figure 1a, lanes 8­16). These results suggest a speciesspecific interaction between TP2 and hTR. In the micrococcal-nuclease reconstitution of partially purified

To examine whether hTR and TP2 were the only limiting components required for activity, we titrated the levels of hTR and TP2 in the reconstitution system (Figure 3a). Increasing the amount of telomerase RNA while maintaining a fixed concentration of TP2 cDNA caused a parallel increase in telomerase activity (Figure 3a, lanes 4­6). Similarly, at fixed hTR concentrations, increasing the amount of TP2 cDNA template in the reaction also resulted in an

increase in telomerase activity (Figure 3a, lanes 7­9). Therefore, both TP2 and hTR are required and are the limiting components for telomerase activity. To confirm that the reconstituted activity contained recombinant TP2 and purified hTR, the recombinant TP2 protein, which contained a FLAG epitope tag, was immunoprecipitated from the lysate using an anti-FLAG antibody. Although FLAG­TP2 was efficiently immunoprecipitated from the lysates (again, the levels of TP2 protein were lower in the presence of hTR), only the immunoprecipitates containing FLAG­TP2 and hTR had telomerase activity (Figure 3b, lanes 6,8). Prior incubation of the antibody with a FLAG peptide, which had the effect of preventing FLAG­TP2 immunoprecipitation, did not result in immunoprecipitation of telomerase
Figure 3

activity (Figure 3b, lane 7), whereas a non-specific peptide had no effect (Figure 3b, lane 8). Reverse transcription and PCR analysis of the immunoprecipitated material showed that hTR was associated with FLAG­TP2 and telomerase activity (Figure 3b, lanes 6,8). Thus, the telomerase activity observed resides in a complex that contains recombinant human TP2 and hTR. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that other rabbit proteins in the lysate contribute to the activity, we examined the lysates and immunoprecipitates using polyclonal antibodies against the telomerase-associated protein TP1/TLP1 (encoded by the TEP1 gene [5,6]), and we did not detect a cross-reactive species. To determine whether the reverse transcriptase domain of TP2 was essential for telomerase activity in vitro, we

TP2 and hTR are limiting and necessary for telomerase activity in vitro. (a) Results of telomerase assays. Lanes 1,2, 5 µg HeLa cell lysate in the absence and presence of RNAse A; lane 3, TP2 cDNA only (0.1 µg cDNA in a 10 µl transcription­translation reaction); lanes 4­6, 0.02 µg full-length TP2 cDNA (in 50 µl reticulocyte lysate) translated in the presence of 0.001 µg, 0.005 µg or 0.01 µg hTR RNA per µl lysate; lanes 7­9, increasing amounts of TP2 cDNA (0.01 µg, 0.02 µg, or 0.05 µg in 50 µl reticulocyte lysate) translated in the presence of 0.002 µg/ µl hTR in the lysate. (b) The reticulocyte lysate (approximately 10 µl) containing TP2 only (0.5 µg, lane 1) or TP2 and hTR (0.5 µg TP2 cDNA and 0.5 µg hTR in a 50 µl transcription­translation reaction, lane 2) was immunoprecipitated using 10 µl agarose beads containing anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak), washed, and then analyzed for telomerase activity (upper panel), or subjected to western blot analysis using 0.2 µg/ml anti-TP2 antiserum (middle panel) or reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis using hTRspecific primers (lower panel). The immunoprecipitations were carried

out with no competing peptide (lanes 3,6), a specific peptide (FLAG, lanes 4,7), or a non-specific peptide derived from TP1 [5] (NS, lanes 5,8). In the lower panel, as controls, the RT-PCR was carried out in the absence (­) or presence (+) of hTR RNA. The slightly smaller species detected by RT-PCR in lanes 1 and 2 (indicated by asterisk) is not specific for the hTR primers. (c) Effect of TP2 point mutations on telomerase activity. Lane 1, wild-type TP2 cDNA (0.5 µg in a 50 µl reticulocyte lysate reaction containing 0.1 µg/µl hTR RNA); lanes 2­5, TP2 cDNAs carrying the indicated point mutation (0.5 µg in a 50 µl reticulocyte lysate reaction containing 0.1 µg/µl hTR); lane 6, no cDNA template added. In the lower panel, each of the in vitro translation mixtures (approximately 2 µl) in (a) was analyzed by western blotting using 0.2 µg/ml anti-TP2 antiserum. The positions of protein markers are shown at the right and the position of full-length TP2 is indicated at the left. TP2 cDNAs carrying point mutations were transcribed and translated as described for wild-type, FLAG-tagged TP2 in the legend to Figure 1.

introduced point mutations in sequences encoding conserved aspartate residues within the reverse transcriptase domain of TP2 [12]. Mutant TP2 proteins were produced which carried the single amino acid substitutions D868A, D869A and D712A, and the double substitution D868A,D869A (using the single-letter amino-acid code). We showed previously that each of these point mutations severely decrease telomerase activity associated with transfected, recombinant TP2 in human cell lysates [12]. Reticulocyte lysates supplied with wild-type TP2 and hTR contained telomerase activity (Figure 3c, lane 1), however the point mutated forms of TP2 could not reconstitute activity (Figure 3c, lanes 2­5). Although the levels of mutant TP2 proteins were higher than the level of wild-type TP2 (Figure 3c, lower panel), similar results were also obtained when the proteins were first translated and equal amounts mixed with purified hTR. The fact that telomerase activity is completely abolished only when mutant TP2 protein is present shows that a functional reverse transcriptase domain within TP2 is essential for catalytic activity. In yeast, the introduction of these analagous mutations in the reverse transcriptase domain of the TP2 homolog Est2 completely abolishes telomerase activity in crude cell lysates [8,16]. In yeast, the telomerase RNA TLC1 and the Est1, Est2, Est3, and Est4/Cdc13 proteins are each essential for maintenance of telomere length in vivo [17­19], but only Est2 and TLC1 are essential for telomerase activity in cell lysates [8,20,21]. Despite the known association of telomerase activity with other protein subunits in vivo, such as TP1/TLP1 [5,6], human telomerase might contain only two essential components -- TP2 and hTR. Further purification of the reconstituted enzyme will be required to rule out the contribution of other reticulocyte proteins to telomerase activity. The reticulocyte-lysate telomerase-reconstitution system described here will be useful in further elucidating the role of TP2 and other associated proteins in telomerase function, such as elongation, processivity, telomerase RNA binding and telomeric primer recognition. Recently, the reconstitution of human telomerase activity in reticulocyte lysates and in human cell lines with recombinant TRT1 was reported by Weinrich et al. [22] and Nakayama et al. [23]. The gene symbol TP2 is provisional and the allocation of an official gene symbol is currently under consideration by the Human Genome Organization nomenclature committee.
