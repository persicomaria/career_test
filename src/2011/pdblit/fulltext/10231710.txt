Key words: endothelin-1; ETB agonist; molecular modelling; NMR; solution structure Abstract: The solution structure of a biologically active modi®ed linear endothelin-1 analogue, ET1±21[Cys(Acm)1,15, Aib3,11, Leu7], has been determined for the ®rst time by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a methanol-d3/water solvent mixture. Out of approximately one hundred linear peptide analogues tested by biological assay, this peptide, together with a dozen others, showed signi®cant ETB selective agonist activity. Here we report the solution structure of an ETB selective agonist of a full-length, synthetic linear endothelin analogue. The calculated structures indicate that the peptide adopts an a-helical conformation between residues Ser5±His16, whilst both N- and C-termini show no preferred conformation. These results suggest that the disulphide bridges normally associated with endothelin and sarafotoxin peptides may not necessarily be important for either ETB receptor binding activity or the formation of a helical conformation in solution.

The endothelin isopeptides have signi®cant structural homology including two disulphide bridges, a cluster of polar-charged side-chains on the hairpin loop and a hydrophobic tail region. These features show remarkable similarity to another group of cardiotoxic peptides, known as sarafotoxins, which are isolated from the venom of the Egyptian burrowing asp, Atractaspis engaddensis (4). Another member of the endothelin/sarafotoxin peptide family named bibrotoxin was isolated from the snake venom of the south African burrowing asp Atractaspis 223

human ETB receptors show equal af®nity towards ET-1, ET2 and ET-3 (17, 22) and the ETC receptor is speci®c for ET-3. The ETB receptor was ®rst found in endothelial cells and it has been identi®ed in many types of tissues including brain, vascular smooth muscle, lung, kidney and heart (20, 21, 23). It was ®rst thought that the ETB receptor was associated with vasodilator activity (17). However, numerous reports have shown that the ETB receptor also mediates vasoconstriction in certain tissues and species (24, 25). The

molecular characteristics and functions of ETA and ETB receptors (26, 27) and the structure±activity relationship studies and pharmacological evaluation of endothelin analogues (11, 28, 29) have been reviewed extensively. Solution studies of the structure of endothelins and endothelin-like peptides are also extensive (30±32). It is clear that whatever solution conditions are used, these peptides adopt roughly similar structures described by helical regions in the middle of the sequence. After considering the previous reports published on biological and pharmacological evaluations of endothelins, we chose to concentrate on studying the ETB selective receptors using modi®ed linear ET-1 analogues. In order to ®nd the requirements for ETB receptor recognition, a series of linear analogues of ET-1 has been synthesised and biological activity tested. To understand the basic structural requirements for biological activity, Peptide LJP1 (Fig. 1) was subjected to solution structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular modelling.

bibroni (5). ET-1 is the most potent vasoconstrictor discovered to date. It is some 10-fold more potent than angiotensin II, and the duration of pressor effects is extremely long (6). Sarafotoxins also share similar biological activities to the endothelins (7), suggesting that endothelin genes have evolved under strong pressure to conserve the structure and function of mature endothelin peptides. The broad distribution of binding sites indicates that endothelin may function in the regulation of a variety of organ systems. In addition to endothelial cells, from which endothelin obviously derives its name, ET-1 is produced by mesangial, kidney, and epithelial cells and also by various human cancer cell lines and human macrophages (8). Endothelin gene transcription occurs in a variety of functional regions in the human brain, especially the hypothalamus. The endothelins elicit a long-lasting vasoconstriction in almost all arteries and veins (9). The many potent effects of the endothelins on the cardiovascular system have implicated this peptide class in a variety of human diseases (10). The distribution of endothelin receptor subtypes in human tissues is of importance owing to the species differences that are emerging and for the design of relevant receptor agonists/antagonists (11). Therefore, the development of selective receptor agonists may provide new therapeutic agents for the treatment of a variety of human diseases. Endothelin has multiple speci®c binding sites on various kinds of cell membranes (12±14). Two endothelin receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB, have been cloned and expressed from bovine and rat lung, respectively (15±17) and also from a variety of human tissues (6, 18, 19). Evidence also exists for a third receptor subtype, ETC (20, 21). Receptor speci®city is known to vary. For example, the bovine ETA receptor is speci®c for ET-1 and ET-2, the rat and 224 |

Materials and Methods
Peptide synthesis

Peptide LJP1 was synthesised on an adapted Applied Biosystems ABI 430 A Peptide Synthesiser using Fmoc chemistry on a 0.25-mmol scale. Wang resin was used as the solid supporter. The amino acid side-chain protections were: OtBu (Asp, Glu), tBu (Ser, Tyr), Boc (Lys), Trt (His) Acm(Cys). Acetylation was carried out in a solution of 0.5 m acetic anhydride, 0.125 m diisopropylethylamine and 0.2% 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in DMF. The Fmoc group was deprotected with 20% piperidine in N,N'dimethylformamide (DMF). The deprotection of Fmoc was monitored on-line by UV detection. All residues were incorporated by double couple cycles using 1-hydroxyl4-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2,3-triazole (HOCt) active ester (33) except for histidine, which was coupled through its HOBt ester owing to increased racemisation with HOCt. In each

Hewage et al . NMR Structure of ET1±21[Cys(Acm)1,15, Aib3,11, Leu7]

cycle, one cartridge containing 0.5 mmol Fmoc amino acid was used and the active ester was formed via the addition of 0.5 mmol N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC). The completed peptide was cleaved from the resin with a mixture of tri¯uoroacetic acid (TFA): ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT): thioanisole : triisopropylsilane (TIS) : water 510 : 1:0.5 : 0.2 : 0.5. After removing TFA in vacuo, the crude peptide was precipitated from ether, then puri®ed using a C18 semipreparative column (250 mm 3 10 mm), eluting with a linear gradient of 0.1% TFA/H2O with an increasing concentration of 0.1% TFA/CH3CN at 5 mL min . The puri®ed peptide including acetamidomethyl (Acm) protected Cys residues at positions 1 and 15 in the sequence, C118H180,N27O34S2, was characterized by Electrospray MS ([MH]+ found = 2582.8; calc.52583.0) and by different analytical HPLC conditions (RP C18, Vydac C18 and Hichrom C18 columns). Amino acid analysis, after acid hydrolysis, gave the correct molar ratios of the constituent amino acids.

acquisition) (37) into 2048 complex data points for the DQFCOSY, TOCSY and NOESY data sets, respectively. Other acquisition parameters for all three data sets were an acquisition time of 0.146 s and a spectral width of 7 kHz. Fourier transformation in F2 was carried out without zero ®lling whereas data in F1 were zero-®lled to 1024 data points prior to Fourier transformation. All-time domain data were apodized in both dimensions using an optimised shifted squared sinebell window function. The real Fourier transformation was carried out on 1024 3 2048 data points. All two-dimensional spectra were acquired on a nonspinning sample. Variable temperature studies of Peptide LJP1 were carried out on a solution of 1 mg of the peptide using a standard onedimensional 1H NMR pulse sequence. Spectra were recorded at temperature intervals of 4 degrees from 290 to 298 K and 5 degrees from 298 to 318 K continuously. Amide protondeuterium exchange experiments were carried out soon after dissolution of 1 mg of the peptide. For standard onedimensional 1H NMR spectra a relaxation delay of 1.5 s was used only during the preparation period to eliminate the residual HOD solvent resonance. Data were recorded at 5-min intervals (15±20 min), 10-min intervals (20±50 min), 15-min intervals (50±80 min), 30-min intervals (80± 140 min), 1 h intervals (140±260 min) and 2 h intervals (260±740 min) consecutively 2 min after the submission of the sample into the magnet. All data were internally referenced to the residual 1H NMR resonance of CD2HOH de®ned as 3.30 p.p.m. Varian's vnmr software (version 4.1) was used for all data acquisition and preliminary data processing.

frequency of 599.945 MHz. Peptide LJP1 (5 mg), was dissolved in 1 : 15CD3OH:H2O (700 mL) except for amide proton exchange studies when 1 : 15CD3OD:D2O was used as solvent. All NMR experiments were performed on the sample at a pH of 3.7 and a temperature of 298 K except for variable temperature studies. One-dimensional NMR data were recorded with a presaturation delay of 1 s. A total of 256 transients were acquired over a 7 kHz spectral width into 35 K data points. The data were zero-®lled to 65536 data points prior to apodization using an optimized shifted squared sinebell function followed by Fourier transformation and phase correction. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive double quantum ®ltered correlated spectroscopy (DQFCOSY) (34), total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) (35) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) (36) data sets were acquired with a presaturation delay of 1 s. The MLEV-17 `clean-tocsy' spin-lock pulse sequence was used with an 80-ms mixing time and two 2 ms trim pulses. A series of NOESY data sets, with mixing times of 40, 80, 150, 200 and 300 ms, were collected and evaluated for the effects of spin-diffusion. The residual water resonance was saturated during preparation and mixing periods. A total of 32, 16 and 32 transients were acquired for each of 2 3 256 t1 increments (hypercomplex

Structure calculation studies were carried out using the Tripos molecular modelling software sybyl version 6.1 (38). Varian NOESY data at 150 ms were converted and processed using the triad module of sybyl. Peak picking was carried out manually. Volume integrals were calculated for all cross-peaks within the triad module, which were then used for generating lower and upper distance constraints. Upper distance bounds were de®ned by volume integral values of Ê Ê Ê 2.8 A (strong), 3.6 A (medium) and 5.0 A (weak). The lower distance bound was in all cases set to the van der Waals Ê radius of 1.8 A. The threshold values of upper distance bounds were established using the known sequential distances of dNN and daN (39). Pseudoatoms with appropriate distance corrections were employed for protons that could not be stereospeci®cally assigned (40). Partially overlapped

signals were ignored in the structure calculation. Slow amide proton exchange rates were observed for some NHs. Constraints between these protons and associated backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms were introduced after the ®rst phase of the structure calculations, when the fold of the peptide chain emerged. Hydrogen bonding partners were identi®ed using the standard model for polypeptide a-helices. These interatomic distance constraints were set in the range Ê Ê 1.8±2.0 A and 2.7±3.0 A for the H±O distance and N±O distances, respectively (41). Torsion angle (w) constraints were calculated using the expression

process by which local energy minima are overcome by successive heating and cooling cycles of the molecular model. DSA calculations began by holding the temperature constant at 1000 K for a period of 5400 fs. During the annealing time of 900 fs, the temperature was reduced `stepwise' until a minimum temperature of 100 K was reached. The Boltzmann scaling of atomic velocities were chosen from a random number. This process completed the ®rst cycle. Ten cycles of DSA were run for each starting structure. The conformations obtained by DSA were further minimized with 200 steps of conjugate-gradient energy minimization. The minimisation parameters used were the same as those described for the diana-calculated structures. The energy minimized conformations were subjected to a ®nal molecular dynamics (MD) quenching calculation without changing either distance or torsional force constants. The MD calculations were performed in the gas phase. The initial atomic velocities were chosen from a random distribution at 1000 K and the dynamic trajectory (100 fs) was followed for 20 ps in 1 fs steps. These calculations were carried out under constant temperature and volume (NTV) ensemble conditions with a 10 fs coupling factor for the temperature. The molecular dynamics calculations were repeated three times for each conformation using different initial values for random number seed (2 3 104, 6 3 104, 1 3 105) to obtain three different conformers for each starting conformation. These three different conformers were then averaged to obtain the averaged conformation. After removing all the distance and torsional experimental energy barriers, these averaged conformers were ®nally subjected to 500 steps of conjugate-gradient energy minimization as described previously.

The distance geometry algorithm for NMR applications program (diana) (43) was used to generate random starting structures based on an initial structure built within sybyl. The 278 distance constraints obtained from NOESY crosspeak volumes were used as input for the diana calculations. Eight constraints for hydrogen bonds and 17 torsional angle constraints were also incorporated. All distance and torsional constraints were included in the diana calculations. Atomic distances were constrained using the force Ê constant kNOE = 1 kcal mol±1 A±2 and torsions were constrained using kDihed_c50.01 kcal mol

was used to calculate 300 structures from random starting conformations and the calculation produced 19 best structures dependent on the ®nal target function value. Distances, which were predetermined by the covalent geometry of the molecule or by conformations that violated the constraints, were regarded as irrelevant by the diana program. These constraints were eliminated during the calculation to yield 173 structurally important constraints de®ned as modi®ed bounds. Structures from diana were subsequently constrained by these modi®ed distance bounds. Interatomic distances were then constrained using a higher force constant of kNOE = 10 Ê kcal mol±1 A±2 and torsions were constrained using the same force constant of kDihed_c50.01 kcal mol

Results
Peptide LJP1 was synthesized with the side-chains of cysteine residues Cys1 and Cys15 protected with the ± CH2±NH±CO±CH3 (Acm) group to prevent disulphide bridge formation. Methionine, which is liable to oxidation, is commonly replaced by norleucine or leucine without any loss of biological activity (44). For this reason methionine at position 7 was replaced by leucine in Peptide LJP1. To improve the stability and solubility of this analogue, Cys3 and Cys11 were replaced by a-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib). Macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids and peptides are naturally found in aqueous environments. Most of the linear ET-1 analogues synthesized in this laboratory were partially soluble in water although several

The Tripos 5.2 force ®eld with the standard Sybyl energy minimizer MAXIMIN 2 was used in the minimization procedure. Other parameters for constraining covalent Ê geometry were kBond = 600 kcal mol±1 A±2, kAngle = 0.02 kcal mol±1 deg±2 and kTor = 0.2 kcal mol±1 deg±2.

duplicated amino acids were identi®ed by sequence-speci®c assignments using NOESY data sets. The identi®cation of individual spin patterns for aromatic resonances was determined by direct comparison of the TOCSY and NOESY data. A prominent cross-peak between the N-terminal Cys(Acm)1aH and Ser2NH resonances was clearly visible in the NOESY spectrum and hence Ser2 and Aib3 were identi®ed (Fig. 3). Because Lys9 and Glu10 were unique residues, it was possible to identify the neighbours Asp8 and Aib11, thus resolving the Asp18 ambiguity. The unique residue Trp21 showed bH to aromatic proton 4H connectivity, con®rming the spin patterns of Trp21. The cross-peak between Asp18 aH and Ile19 NH resonances was clear and the sequence Asp18± Ile19±Ile20±Trp21 was therefore identi®ed. Strong backbone connectivity of Asp18 con®rmed the spin system of Leu17. The backbone connectivity of His16/Leu17 was clear and the above sequence extended back to His16. The backbone connectivity aiH/Ni+1H was clearly visible for two adjacent leucine residues, Leu6 and Leu7, and the sequence Leu6± Leu7±Asp8±Lys9±Glu10±Aib11 was thus identi®ed. Two adjacent serines, Ser4 and Ser5, which showed aiH/NiH backbone connectivity extended the above sequence up to the Ser4 residue. The unique Val12 showed strong backbone connectivity to Tyr13 and the remaining aromatic residue Phe14 and nonaromatic Cys(Acm)15 were then identi®ed. The sequence-speci®c resonance assignments were completed and all the individual spin systems were then identi®ed. The biH/Ni+1H and NiH/Ni+1H connectivities

This solvent mixture is frequently used in HPLC analysis and is also known to induce helix formation. To our knowledge this mixed solvent has not been used in previously reported endothelin and endothelinlike peptide studies except our studies.

methyl resonances of two isobutyric acid residues, Aib3 and Aib11, also showed strong long-range connectivities to Leu6NH and Phe14NH, respectively. A weak long-range connectivity was observed for methyls of Aib3 to the amide proton of Leu7. These aiH/Ni+nH long-range cross-peaks indicated the likelihood of a-helix formation for the sequence Ser5±Leu17. The aliphatic region of the NOESY spectrum showed strong aiH/bi+3H cross-peaks, thus conFigure 4. Summary of sequential nOe connectivities observed for Peptide LJP1.

®rming this likelihood. Long-range connectivities were clearly visible between Ser5/Asp8, Leu6/Lys9, Leu7/Glu10, Asp8/Aib11, Lys9/Val12, Glu10/Tyr13 and Val12/Cys(Acm)15. The strong backbone connectivities of the NiH/Ni+1H observed in the segment Aib3/Cys(Acm)15 also con®rmed the probable helical character of Peptide LJP1. On dissolving the sample in a CD3OD/D2O mixture, all of the NH proton resonances were initially observable except for those from residues 1±3. In this solvent, the amide protons of Ser4 and Ser5 disappeared 12 min after acquiring the ®rst 1D 1H NMR spectrum. The amide protons of the N-terminal residues

of neighbouring amino acid residues supported the reliability of the resonance assignments (Fig. 4). Chemical shift values are given in Table 1.

highly ordered conformation in which a helical region extended from Ser5 to His16. The w and y angles of residues Ser5±His16 showed good convergence (Table 3). In comparison, w and y angles of the C-terminal residues did not converge. The tail region showed no de®ned orientation relative to the folded core portion. The ordered side-chain groups adopted a stable conformation as evidenced by numerous interresidue NOE constraints observed for this region. Although the x1 dihedral angle was well-de®ned for some residues (Ser2, Leu6, Leu7, Glu10, Val12, His16 and Ile20), other torsion angles were poorly de®ned throughout the molecule. Similarly, the wide variance in w and y at residue Leu17 suggested that this residue acts as a hinge, facilitating different orientations of the tail with respect to the rest of the molecule. The structures obtained for Peptide LJP1 remain within one family of conformations. The Nterminal tail region is the least-de®ned portion of the family of calculated solution structures. This indicates that this region is more conformationally ¯exible than the rest of the molecule. The C-terminal region of the calculated structures (residues 17±21) also showed no preferred conformation, as demonstrated by the signi®cant variations of the w and y torsion angles in this region. The slow rate of amide proton exchange for residues Ile19 Ile20 and Trp21 highlights poor solvent accessibility in the C-terminal region. This

Ile19 and Trp21 were still observable even after 25 min (Fig. 5), data that strongly support the presence of a hydrogen-bonded segment.

The calculated structures obtained for Peptide LJP1 were in good agreement with the experimentally derived constraints.

(45), show evidence of a helical region between residues 9±16 and in a few cases a turn between residues 5±8 (30±32). Previous studies have shown chemical shifts of amide proton resonances for Lys9±His16 of ET-1 studied in different solvents to be remarkably different from one structure to another (Dd50.05 p.p.m.). By contrast, the chemical shifts of C-terminal residue proton resonances for Leu17±Trp21 are almost the same, except for those of Tyr13 and Phe14. Earlier results from our work (45), in which the structure of ET-1 was determined in the same solvent mixture as the current work, enable clear comparisons to be made between the `cyclic' and `linear' nature of ET-1 and Peptide LJP1, respectively. Prior to the current work, the effect of disulphide replacements on the solution conformation of the resulting peptides relative to that of native ET-1 has remained largely unclear. The determination of the solution structure of Peptide

suggests the presence of hydrogen-bonding character, which could be due to partial ordering of the C-terminal tail.

Discussion
Knowledge of the structure of Peptide LJP1, recently found to be an ETB selective agonist (44), is important in broadening the search for peptidic receptors. The NMR structures of ET-1 in different solvents, including our previous report 230 |

LJP1 shows that the structure is essentially a-helical between residues Ser5±His16. This is re¯ected in the atomic r.m.s.d. ®gures calculated for both global and backbone-only Ê Ê structures (3.60 u 0.81 A compared with 0.45 u 0.14 A, respectively). A comparison of our structure of ET-1 and that of Peptide LJP1 in the same solvent mixture shows that the

Hewage et al . NMR Structure of ET1±21[Cys(Acm)1,15, Aib3,11, Leu7]

a-helix of Peptide LJP1 is extended by one full turn in the Nterminal direction, a result of the absence of disulphide linkages. In the case of ET-1, the presence of a disulphide linkage between residues Cys3 and Cys11 prohibits a-helix formation towards the N-terminus, in which case the ahelix is restricted to residues Lys9±His16. This restriction is lifted in the case of Peptide LJP1 and the molecule therefore has the freedom to adopt a more stable conformation over most of its length. The replacement of cysteins by Aib residues at positions 3 and 11 could also be a factor responsible for the observed extension in helicity. The Cterminus of Peptide LJP1 re¯ects that of ET-1 in adopting a random (mobile) conformation. Most of the residues that are generally reported to be responsible for biological activity amongst endothelin analogues (46, 47) are, in the current case of Peptide LJP1, in the a-helix, except for the C-terminal residue Trp21. Substitution of Met7 by Leu or oxidation of Met has previously been reported to cause no loss in agonist activity in isolated rabbit artery [ETA] and rat pulmonary artery [ETB] (48). Substitution of Met (in ET-1) by Leu in Peptide LJP1 also appears not to affect activity (44). The ETB selective linear analogue ET1±21[Ala

ET8±21[Ala11,15], are potent ETB agonists causing vasoconstriction in the rabbit pulmonary artery (50). Previous reports (51, 52) for the ETA receptor suggest that the two cysteine linkages are required for vasoconstrictor activity and receptor binding activity. The full-length linear analogue ET1±21[Ala1,3,11,15] shows a 5500-fold reduction in binding af®nity to the ETA receptor but only a three-fold reduction to ETB (53, 54), indicating that the disulphide linkage is not essential for ETB binding. Peptide LJP1 has also been shown to display signi®cant ETB receptor selectivity(15 3 104 mM) and further studies suggest that cysteine replacements at positions 3 and/or 11 do not alter the biological activity of the resulting peptides (44). Structure±activity relationship studies amongst this class of linear synthetic endothelin analogues are currently in progress in this laboratory and will be reported in due course.
