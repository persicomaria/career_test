Ovalbumin is a member of a superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors, known as the serpins. It is, however, non-inhibitory towards serine proteinases, and lacks the loop insertion mechanism common to the serpins due to unknown structural factors. Mutant ovalbumin, R339T, in which the P14 hinge residue is replaced, was produced and analyzed for its thermostability and three-dimensional structure. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the mutant ovalbumin, but not the wild-type protein, undergoes a marked thermostabilization (ÁTm  15.8  C) following the P1-P1H cleavage. Furthermore, the crystal structure, solved at Ê 2.3 A resolution, clearly proved that the P1-P1H cleaved form assumes the fully loop-inserted conformation as seen in serpin that possess inhibitory activity. We therefore conclude that ovalbumin acquires the structural transition mechanism into the loop-inserted, thermostabilized form by the single hinge mutation. The mutant protein does not, however, possess inhibitory activity. The solved structure displays the occurrence of speci®c interactions that may prevent the smooth motion, relative to sheet A, of helices E and F and of the loop that follows helix F. These observations provide crucial insights into the question why R339T is still non-inhibitory.

The serpins are a family of serine proteinase inhibitors, which control serine proteinases involved in diverse physiological reactions.1 They undergo a unique conformational change upon exertion of the inhibition: after undergoing proteolytic cleavage at the P1-P1H site of the proteinase, the reactive center loop is inserted into the central b-sheet A, thereby moving the trapped active-site serine residue to the far opposite side of the complex.2 The dynamic conformational change is from a metastable state to the stabilized state, as re¯ected in a marked increase in thermostability.3 The native serpin structure has, therefore, been considered as a kinetically trapped, metastable intermediate during protein folding in vivo.4 Ovalbumin, a major component of egg-white proteins, is grouped into the serpin superfamily because of the close similarity in the primary and tertiary structures5,6 and since the canonical

loop undergoes cleavage at the P1-P1H site by serine proteinases.7 The egg-white protein, however, has neither the loop-insertion mechanism nor inhibitor activity observed in other serpins.8 There are several possibilities for the structural reason behind this. First, the reactive loop structure is signi®cantly different between ovalbumin and inhibitory serpins. The P12-P9 segment comprises small, uncharged residues in inhibitory serpins; the corresponding segment in ovalbumin includes hydrophobic valine residues.5,9 In addition, the reactive loop assumes extended strand or distorted helical conformations in the inhibitory serpins,6 but in ovalbumin the P9-P1 segment is a regular a-helix with less ¯exible nature.10,11 Second, ovalbumin has a higher inherent stability than inhibitory serpins12,13 and refolds in vitro into the native stability state,14 raising the probability that the native state will be fully stabilized. Third, the side-chain of the P14 residue is Thr in most inhibitory serpins, but in ovalbumin it is the bulkier arginine

114 (Arg339). P15-P14 loop site works as a hinge for the loop-insertion transition.8 The insertion of an arginine residue may thus affect this hinge in ovalbumin. Here, we have examined the third hypothesis by X-ray crystallography and differential scanning calorimetry using an ovalbumin mutant R339T in which the P14 hinge residue (Arg339) is replaced by threonine. First, we demonstrate direct evidence that the mutant ovalbumin is transformed into a loop-inserted and thermostabilized form similar to other serpins by the P1-P1H cleavage, which leads us to conclude that the defect of the loop-insertion mechanism in wild-type ovalbumin is due to the third hypothesis. Detailed analyses for the loopinserted structure provide crucial insights into the question of why the ovalbumin mutant is still noninhibitory. Increased thermostability following the P1-P1H cleavage The intact and P1-P1H -cleaved proteins were analyzed for their thermostability by differential scanning calorimetry. As shown in Figure 1, wild-type ovalbumin displayed a denaturation temperature (Tm) of 72.4  C in the intact form and was converted by the P1-P1H cleavage to a slightly less stable form with a Tm value of 71.1  C (pro®les (a) and (b)). The observation is consistent with crystallographic data that eggwhite ovalbumin does not undergo the loop insertion after loop cleavage.8 The R339T mutant displayed the same Tm value of 72.4  C in the intact form (pro®le (c)), strongly suggesting that it adopts the same native conformation as the wild-type protein. The most striking observation in Figure 1 is that the R339T mutant was transformed by the P1-P1H cleavage into a highly thermostabilized form with a Tm value of 88.2  C (pro®le (d)). This increase in thermostability of 15.8 degrees C is consistent with the view that the reactive center loop was inserted into b-sheet A following P1-P1H cleavage of the R339T mutant. Loop-inserted structure of P1-P1H cleaved R339T To con®rm that loop insertion occurs, the P1-P1H cleaved form of R339T was crystallized and its structure was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement, using gold and mercury derivatives. Relevant re®nement statistics are given in Table 1. The re®ned structure shows the mutant adopting a fully loop-inserted conformation, like other inhibitory serpins. As displayed in Figure 2, b-sheet A comprises six b-strands (s1A, s2A, s3A, s4A, s5A, and s6A) that form an antiparallel structure, except for the parallel orientation of s1A and s2A. It has been demonstrated that intact egg-white ovalbumin assumes a conformation with a mixed ®vestranded b-sheet A (see Figure 3);10,11 the mutual

The protein thermostability for the (a) intact wild-type, (b) P1-P1H cleaved wild-type, (c) intact R339T, and (d) P1-P1H cleaved R339T protein was analyzed as follows. Wild-type and mutant ovalbumin were expressed in Escherichia coli using the expression vector pET/Ova constructed as described.}24 The mutant R339T was prepared by PCR mutagenesis and con®rmed by DNA sequencing. Production and puri®cation of the wild-type and mutant recombinant ovalbumin were as described.24 For preparation of the P1-P1H cleaved form, recombinant ovalbumin was incubated at 1.0 mg/ml with 1 mg/ml of porcine pancreatic elastase in 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 25  C for four hours. The proteolysis was terminated by phenyl methyl sulfonyl ¯uoride at a ®nal concentration of 1.5 mM, and the cleaved protein was puri®ed using an anion-exchange column (Mono Q 5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.) as described.25 The cleavage at the P1-P1H site was con®rmed by N-terminal sequence analysis: for either the wild-type or mutant protein, N-terminal sequence generated by proteolysis was Ser-Val-Ser-Glu-Glu-Phe, corresponding to the sequence Ser353-Phe358 of ovalbumin. The protein thermostability was analyzed with a differential scanning calorimeter (micro Cal MCS). The temperature was scanned at 1 K minÀ1 and the protein concentration was 0.3 mg/ml in Na-phosphate buffer at pH 6.0. Endothermic transition pro®les are arbitrarily shifted on the ordinate scale for clarity.

orientations of s2A and s3A and of s5A and s6A are antiparallel, but those of s1A and s2A and of s3A and s5A are parallel. These overall structural

The P1-P1H cleaved form of R339T that was prepared as in Figure 1 was crystallized using hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The solution in the crystallization drop was prepared, on a silanized coverslip by mixing 3 ml of protein solution (25 mg/ml 10 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 6.0)) with 3 ml of precipitant solution (47-48 % ammonium sulfate, 0.05 M Bis-Tris buffer (pH 7.0)). The droplets were equilibrated against 1 ml of the precipitant solution at 30  C. Crystals were obtained within two to three weeks. DifÊ fraction data were collected using CuKa radiation (1.5418 A) with a Bruker Hi-star area detector coupled to MAC Science M18XHF Ê rotating-anode generator. A total of 98,045 re¯ections were collected to 2.2 A resolution. The data were processed, merged and scaled with Saint program (Bruker Analytical X-ray Instruments, Inc., Madison, WI). The precession images indicated that the crystal belongs to space group P1. Two molecules were included in the asymmetric unit. For multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR), crystals were soaked for one hour at 20  C in the precipitant solution containing 2 mM of NaAu(CN)2, KAu(CN)2, Na2AuCl4, HgCl2, or mersalyl. MIR calculations were performed by Phase program package.26 Electron density map was made with the solvent ¯atÊ tened MIR phase using the data between 15.0 and 3.2 A, and then map averaging was done using non-crystallographic symmetry. Ê The initial model made using MIR map at 3.2 A resolution was re®ned by simulated annealing with molecular dynamics using CNS program package.27 This re®nement and subsequent restrained least squares re®nement yielded R  0.282 for the data between 15.0 Ê Ê and 2.4 A resolution. Several rounds of restrained least squares re®nement onto the resolution at 2.3 A, followed by manual model building, were carried out to improve the model. One hundred and fourteen water molecules having more than 3.5s on the Fo À Fc map were then added to the model. The ®nal model consisted of 762 amino acid residues for two molecules and 114 water moleÊ cules with a R-value of 0.199 (Rfree  0.252) for 30,703 re¯ections with F > 2s(F) between 15-2.3 A resolution. The electron density Ê maps (2Fo À Fc, contoured at 1 s) were calculated using the re¯ection data at 15.0-2.3 A resolution. Residue Pro93 and the P1H to P3H residues (Ser353, Val354 and Ser355) are not included in the model, because no clearly interpretable electron density could be seen.

characteristics of intact and loop-inserted ovalbumin are consistent with the canonical structural transition mechanism of inhibitory serpins.6 Motion of the individual Ca atoms upon the loop insertion Despite the acquisition of the loop-insertion mechanism, the mutant ovalbumin R339T displays no inhibitory activity, at least against elastase and subtilisin (unpublished results). To investigate the structural implications for the functional defect, we calculated the mode of motion of the individual Ca atoms upon the loop insertion using the structures of the intact

egg-white protein11 and cleaved R339T. The same analysis was also done for an inhibitory serpin a1-antitrypsin. Overall structures are compared between the intact and cleaved forms by superimposed Ca traces as shown in Figure 3(a) and (b). The mode of motion of individual Ca atoms was evaluated by two ways: by the distances of the same Ca atoms between the two states and by the changes in the torsion angles for rotations around the virtual bonds connecting Ca atoms. Figure 3(c) and (d) demonstrate that a large conformational transition occurs in the inserted loop segment of either ovalbumin or a1-antitrypsin; the Ca atom of P1 site moves

The superimposed overall conformations are shown in blue and red for the intact and cleaved forms, respectively. (b) The same calculation was done for the intact (PDB 1QLP) and cleaved a1-antitrypsin Ê (PDB 1EZX), giving an r.m.s.d. of 1.0 A for 288 Ca atoms. The superimposed overall conformations are shown in the same way. (c) The mode of motion of the individual Ca atoms in ovalbumin was evaluated by the distances of the same Ca atoms between the intact and cleaved forms (black continuous line) and by the changes in the torsion angles for rotations around the virtual bonds connecting Ca atoms (red continuous line). The torsion angle was calculated using program CNS. The horizontal bars represent the secondary structure segments along the primary structure in green for a-helices and in yellow for b-strands. The red bar represents the segment of the reactive center loop (RCL). (d) The mode of motion of the individual Ca atoms for a1-antitrypsin are shown in the same way.

changes in the preceding residues of strand 5A, found commonly in ovalbumin and a1-antitrypsin, are related to the formation of b-structure by these residues through the interactions with the inserted strand 4A (see Figure 2). Marked differences between ovalbumin and a1-antitrypsin are found in the mode of motion of the large contiguous segment that comprises the secondary structure elements of strands 1A, 2A and 3A and helices E and F. In a1-antitrypsin, the helices E and F move greatly in the Ca distance pro®le but not in the torsion angle pro®le (Figure 3 (d)), which indicates their rigid body-like motion. Strands 1A, 2A, and 3A and the loop region descending helix F move in both Ca distance and torsion angle pro®les. The mobile nature of the large contiguous segments appears to enable its smooth sliding as a structural unit, thereby leaving room for the reactive center loop to be inserted as strand 4A (Figure 3(b)), as discussed15 after comparison of intact ovalbumin10,11 and cleaved a1-antitrypsin.16 For this sliding, the loop segment that links strand 2A and immobile helix D probably works as cushion, as re¯ected in great motion in both the Ca distance and torsion angle pro®les.

In the ovalbumin mutant, however, little motion is detected in the entire segments of helix E and the loop that follows helix F (Figure 3 (c)). The motion of helix F itself is signi®cantly restrained as well. The restrained motion of these segments may force upon the loop insertion a perturbed sliding of strands 1A, 2A and 3A, which may be compensated by large motion in the torsion angles of the residues between strand 2A and helix E, and between helix E and strand 1A. The apparent mobile nature of the loop segment preceding helix D, found uniquely in ovalbumin, cannot be related to the loop-insertion mechanism, since the segment takes on a disordered structure in both the intact10,}11 or the cleaved form. Multiple interactions of helix F and the loop following it with sheet A The absence of a large motion of helix E in ovalbumin can be directly related to the unique occurrence of a disul®de bond (Cys73-Cys120) that links helix E and the loop preceding helix D. The restrained motion of helix F and the loop following it may be related to the multiple interactions of these segments with sheet A, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Interactions of helix F and its descending loop with sheet A. Ca traces for (a) intact egg white ovalbumin and for (b) P1-P1H cleaved R339T are shown in white except that the reactive center loop or inserted b-strand is represented in orange. The main chain atoms involved in hydrogen bonds are shown in the standard colors. The sidechain groups of Arg104, Trp148, Lys290 and Gln325 are shown in red, yellow, blue and green, respectively. The indole plane of Trp148 and the plane formed by the Ne, Cz, Nr1, and Nr2 atoms of Arg104 intersect with dihedral angles of 12.7  and 10.2  in the intact and cleaved forms, respectively. The shortest distance between the two planes Ê Ê are 3.3 A for the Arg104-Nr1 to Trp148-N1 distance in intact ovalbumin and 3.1 A for the Arg104-Nr1 to Trp148-Cd1 distance in cleaved R339T.

First, two main chain oxygen atoms (Asn159-O and Val160-O) in the extended loop that follows helix F receive hydrogen bonds from Lys290-Nz on strand 6A. Second, Ser165-O in the same extended loop makes hydrogen bonds with Gln325-Ne2 on strand 5A. The third interaction is the stacking-like interaction formed between the indole ring plane of Trp148 of helix F and the plane formed by the Nr1, Nr2, Cz, and Ne atoms of Arg104 on strand 2A; the two planes exist almost parallel in a close proximity (Figure 4(b)). The same interactions, except for the hydrogen bond Val160-O Á Á Á Lys290-Nz, also exist in intact egg-white ovalbumin (Figure 4(a)). These interactions are mostly absent in the inhibitory serpins, although counterparts for the ®rst and

second interactions exist in the intact form of a stable mutant of plasminogen activator inhibitor117 and in cleaved a1-antitrypsin,2 respectively. Conclusions The structural and calorimetric evidence shown here clearly demonstrate that the ovalbumin mutant R339T is transformed by the P1-P1H cleavage into the fully loop-inserted conformation with ÁTm value of 15.8  C (Figures 1 and 2). Huntington et al. have shown that an ovalbumin mutant R339S is thermostabilized with a decreased ÁTm of 11  C after the P1-P1H cleavage;18 the limited thermostabilization led them to conclude that the P1-P1H cleaved R339S is a partially loop-inserted

product.18 This conclusion is supported by the accessible nature of the P8-P7 site of the P1-P1H cleaved R339S when exposed to subtilisin,18 which shows no loop cleavage activity for the P1-P1H cleaved R339T (unpublished result). The conserved Thr residue is therefore considered to be the ideal P14 residue for the loop-insertion mechanism. The R339T and R340T19 mutants, however, display no inhibitory activity against serine proteinases without extensive structural recombination that generates the chimeric proteins of ovalbumin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2. The decelerated loop-insertion results in the escape of trapped proteinase, and hence the decrease or loss of the inhibitory activity.20 The non-inhibitory nature of R339T may therefore be related to our observation that the ®rst order rate constant for the loop insertion is very slow (about 4 Â 10À3 sÀ1; unpublished results). In a study of a1-antitrypsin,21 the importance of destabilized native interactions between helix F and sheet A were discussed; ®lling a cavity around Gly117 in strand 2A with a bulkier residue, which confers an increased stability on the inhibitor, results in decelerated loop insertion and in decreased inhibitory activity. The counterpart of Gly117 in R339T is Arg104, which interacts with Trp148 of helix F (Figure 4). This Arg104-Trp148 interaction, along with the multiple interactions of the loop that follows helix F with sheet A (Figure 4), can be directly related to the decelerated loop-insertion rate, hence to the absence of inhibitory activity, in R339T. These interactions may contribute to a higher inherent stability of intact ovalbumin than inhibitory serpins,12,13 which might be related, at least in part, to the non-inhibitory nature as well. The mechanism of serpin action has largely been investigated by the ``negative'' mutation of inhibitory serpins, by which the functional role of an amino acid residue is evaluated on the basis of the loss of activity.5,22,23 Nevertheless, the different approach of attempting to induce activity in a noninhibitory serpin would provide alternative evidence for the structure-function relationship of serpins. The results presented here should provide crucial insights for logical molecular design toward conferring serpin inhibitory activity on ovalbumin.
