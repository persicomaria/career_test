INTRODUCTION Methanococcus jannaschii, a strict anaerobic methaneproducing organism, provided the first complete genome sequence reported for an archaeon.1 This exercise provided an opportunity to compare the three domains of life at the genetic level for the first time. We have cloned the gene MJ1651 (gi: 15669847) from Methanococcus jannaschii DSM 2661 and over expressed its 263-residue protein product in E. coli to investigate both threedimensional structure and function. MJ1651 is a member of the DUF62 Pfam family (pfam 01887),2 which contains both archeal and eubacterial members of no known function. Herein, we report the X-ray crystal structure of ° MJ1651 determined at 2.5 A resolution via the singlewavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using selenium-labeled protein. The structure is composed of two domains: an N-terminal aba sandwich domain and a C-terminal b-strand domain. As expected, the structure of MJ1651 resembles those of other DUF62 family members. Although its structure is most closely related to that of a bacterial fluorinating enzyme, we suggest that the biological function of MJ1651 is different.

ATTTTAG) and a reverse (CAATCTCAATCTCATCTAAATAATCAACATTC) primer. The amplified gene was gel purified and cloned into TC - psb3 (TC) vector designed to express the protein of interest with a C-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag. Protein expression/purification utilized previously published protocols, which are described in detail in PepcDB (pepcdb.pdb.org).
Crystallization and data collection

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene cloning and protein production

Single crystals of MJ1651 were grown via sitting-drop vapor diffusion [2 lL protein solution (6­10 mg/mL) mixed with 2 lL reservoir solution (600 lL) containing 50% MPD, 0.2M ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, TrisHCl, pH 8.0]. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen following addition of 15­20% (v/v) glycerol to the mother liquor. Diffraction data were collected under standard cryogenic conditions using beamline X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were processed using HKL2000.3 Crystals grew in the monoclinic space group C2 (unit-cell parame° ° ° ters: a ¼ 126.8 A, b ¼ 110.1 A, c ¼ 75.8 A, and b ¼ ° 115.48). The calculated Matthews coefficient is 2.52 A3/Da, assuming three molecules per asymmetric unit, which corresponds to 51% solvent content by volume. Crystal and data collection statistics are provided in Table I.

The gene for MJ1651 was amplified using polymerase chain reaction from Methanococcus jannaschii genomic DNA using a forward (GGGATTTATATGAGGGATGAT-

Structure determination

The selenium substructure was determined using SOLVE,4 permitting location of 10 of a possible 15 heavy atom sites. Automated model building with RESOLVE yielded structural information for $50% of the three polypeptide chains comprising the asymmetric unit. An entire polypeptide chain, barring a few segments, was assembled from the output of RESOLVE and the balance of the model was manually built using O.5 The complete asymmetric unit containing all three protomers (A, B, and C) was then generated using the requisite non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators. Refinement was performed using CNS.6 The following termini and loop segments were not visible in the experimental electron density map and were not included in structure refinement (A: 1­8, 87­90, 132­139, 190­199, and 265­273; B: 1­10, 87­90, 132­140, 195­196, and 265­273; C: 1­10, 87­90, 132­139, 192­194, and 265­273). The final refined model of MJ1651 consists of three protomers and 31 solvent atoms. Refinement statistics are provided in Table I.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structure of MJ1651

MJ1651 adopts the a/b fold [Fig. 1(a)]. The molecule ° has approximate dimensions of 55 3 35 3 35 A3, and consists of two domains: the N-terminal core domain and the small C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain (residues 9­168) is composed of a seven-stranded mixed b-sheet (b1­b7) sandwiched by two a-helices on each side (a1 and a4; a2 and a3). The C-terminal domain (residues 174­264) is composed of two b-sheets. The four (b8, b9, b12, b13) and three (b10, b11, b14) antiparallel stranded b-sheets are arranged perpendicular to one another forming a small b barrel. A cartoon representation of the secondary structure is given in Figure 1(b). A 10-residue random coil segment connects the Nterminal and C-terminal domains.
Biological unit

clustered around the threefold axis, making intimate contact with each other. The C-terminal domains make no intermolecular contacts with each other. Instead, they interact with the N-terminal domains of other monomers making up the trimer. Within the monoclinic crystal form we obtained, MJ1651 forms a hexamer via crystallographic symmetry with the two asymmetric units forming a dimer of trimers. The two trimers associate frontto-front [Fig. 2(b)] via interactions mediated by three b11 strand from each trimer. After such an association, three six-stranded extended b-sheets formed firmly holds the hexamer assembly. Strands b10, b11, and b14 of each monomer from both the trimers associate to form such three six-stranded continuous b-sheets. We believe that this larger assembly represents the biologically active form of MJ1651, because analytical gel filtration documented that the protein occurs as a hexamer in solution.

Comparison with homologous structures

The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains three protomers arranged as a trimer about a threefold NCS axis [Fig. 2(a)]. The three N-terminal domains are tightly

A DALI10 search revealed a number of structures similar to that of MJ1651, including PH0463 from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 [PDB ID: 1WU8, Z score ¼ 23.8, 36% sequence identity, and root-mean-square deviation ° (rmsd) ¼ 2.1 A for 212 structurally equivalent a-carbon atomic pairs], a conserved protein of unknown function (TTHA0338) from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (2CW5, Z ° ¼ 24.2, sequence identity ¼ 26%, and rmsd ¼ 2.0 A for 212 pairs), and a fluorinase from Streptomyces cattleya (1RQR/2C2W, Z ¼ 21.0, sequence identity ¼ 23%, and ° rmsd ¼ 2.8 A for 217 pairs). Each of these homologs, including the fluorinase (1RQR), belongs to the same Pfam family, DUF62 Pfam.

forming b1Àa1 loop), IDISH (motif 2, residues 49­53 in the b2-strand), PDNGLFT (motif 3, residues 107­113 of helix a3), TFHGRD (motif 4, residues 137­142 forming a4Àb7 loop), and DRFGN (motif 5, residues 179­ 183 forming b8Àb9 loop). Motif 1 of molecule A interacts with motif 5 of molecule C. The IDISH conserved motif 2 residues from each monomer are symmetrically arrayed around the threefold NCS axis near the center of the trimer, where they appear to engage in stabilizing interactions. Residues of motif 3 interact with the loop that connects the N-terminal to C-terminal domain. Motif 4, which is not visible in our structure, is located close to where the N-terminal domain of molecule A contacts the C-terminal domain of molecule C in known structural homologs. At the trimer interface, the interaction is mainly between the residues belonging to a1 helix of molecule A and the residues of b1 strands, b2 strands, and a2 helix of molecule C. In addition, residues belonging to loop b1Àa1 of molecule A interact with residues of loop b8Àb9 of molecule C (molecule B interacts with molecule A in a similar way the molecule A interacts with molecule C). In the sequence alignment illustrated in Figure 3, an extended loop of about 15 residues in the N-terminal domain occurs only in the fluorinase. From our structural analysis it appears that the conserved motifs are important for the structural integrity and quaternary structure of the DUF62 family proteins.

The alignment was constructed using CLUSTAL-W12 with the bottom line representing the degree of homology ­ ``*'' identical, ``:'' conserved, and ``.'' semiconserved.

Although the fold of the N-terminal domain of all the DUF62 family structures is the same there are some differences in the structure of C-terminal domain. The four-stranded b-sheet (b8, b9, b12, b13) is common to all the structures. The other b-sheet is made up of five strands in both 1WU8 and fluorinase, four strands in 2CW5, and three strands in MJ1651 [b10, b11, b14; Fig. 1(b)]. Despite this difference, the strand b11 is conserved in both MJ1651 and fluorinase and they could form the same hexamer assembly. A PSI-BLAST11 search for sequence homologs of MJ1651 identified a number of homologs from both eubacteria and archaea, with several conserved motifs (Fig. 3), including TDFGT (motif 1, residues 19­24

Both MJ1651 and the flourinase form front-to-front hexamers via crystallographic symmetry with the two asymmetric units forming a dimer of trimers. Interaction between the two trimers occurs exclusively via C-terminal domain for both MJ1651 and the fluorinase. The three b11 strands from each trimer associate to form a sixstranded continuous b-sheet in MJ1651 and a 10stranded b-sheet in fluorinase. It is interesting to see here that though MJ1651 and fluorinase differ in the number of strands in this b-sheet (b10, b11, b14 in MJ1651), they form the same hexamer assembly. It is remarkable that the secondary structural elements required for both the trimer and hexamer structural association are preserved in MJ1651 and fluorinase structures. In contrast, 1WU8 forms a back-to-back hexamer via crystallographic symmetry, via interactions between N-terminal domains.
Chlorinase activity assay and putative active site identification

X-ray crystal structures of the fluorinase bound to substrate and product has been reported.7 This enzyme converts inorganic fluorine to organic fluoride by catalyzing CÀ bond formation. Fluorinase also acts as a chloriÀF nase.8 Among the DUF62 homolog proteins, the fluoriPROTEINS

The conserved secondary structure elements close to the active site are shown in ribbons representation.

nase (chlorinase) from Streptomyces cattleya is the only enzyme with defined biological activity. Despite very low sequence identity (15%), the structures of MJ1651 and flu° orinase are quite similar (rmsd ¼ 2.8 A). An assay of halogenase (chlorinase) activity with MJ1651 used for crystallization failed to show significant chlorinase activity. The X-ray crystal structure of 1WU8, a protein of unknown function, showed an adenosine molecule bound in position analogous to that occupied by the adenine moiety of SAM in the active site of the fluorinase.7 Comparison of this region of the structures 1WU8, the fluorinase, and MJ1651 revealed considerable similarity, which suggests that it represents the active site of DUF62 family members. The fluorinase and MJ1651 share a number of conserved residues in this putative active site, including Asp20 (Asp16 in fluorinase), Phe136 (Phe156), Asp179 (Asp210), Phe181 (Phe213), Asn183 (Asn215), and Ser236 (Ser269). Other residues lining the putative active site are Glu25 (Asp21 in fluorinase), Tyr27 (Ser23), Asp84 (Tyr77), Ala141 (Ser158), Glu237 (Arg270), and Phe245 (Ala279) [Fig. 4(a,b)]. Residues from Asp179 onwards are contributed by the second promoter of the asymmetric unit. In the fluorinase, Ser158 participates in

catalysis, binding to the halogen and O4 of SAM. We suggest that these differences in the putative active site reflect functional differences between the fluorinase and MJ1651. CONCLUSIONS We described the determination of the structure of MJ1651 from Methanococcus jannaschii. Structure and sequence comparison with homologous proteins helped us to identify common structural features that explain trimeric/hexameric self-association of DUF62 family members. We also identified the putative active site of MJ1651, and documented that the protein is not a chlorinase. The structure has been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (ID: 2F4N).
