Abstract This study describes the characterisation of a chimeric mutant derived from two arabidopsis glucosyltransferases, 71C1 and 71C3. A chimera, N1C3, was constructed to contain the N-terminal domain of 71C1 and the C-terminal domain of 71C3. The chimera and the wild-type GTs displayed a similar Km towards the acceptor scopoletin. However, N1C3 had a Km near identical to 71C3 towards UDP-glucose, but was three-fold lower than that of 71C1. The results suggest that the acceptor and sugar donor are recognised independently by the N- and C-terminal domain of the GTs respectively, and provide a foundation for the future design of glucosyltransferase biocatalysts through assembling domains with different affinity towards the acceptor and donor. ” 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1. Introduction Glycosyltransferases (GTs) have been classified into 90 families on the basis of similarities in amino acid sequence and reaction stereochemistry (CAZy web server, http://afmb. cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/) [1,2]. Glycosyltransferases of Family 1 are capable of transferring sugar moieties from activated sugar donors to a wide range of small lipophilic acceptors leading to an increase in water solubility, improved chemical stability and altered biological activity of the sugar conjugates. In plants, Family 1 GTs play an important role in metabolic homeostasis, regulation of phytohormone activities and detoxification of xenobiotics such as herbicides and pesticides [3e5]. To date, only a small number of Family 1 GTs have been structurally analysed due to difficulties associated with overexpression of their genes, protein purification and crystallisation

[6e14]. However, the structures of three plant GTs have been recently solved [8,13,14] and these confirm earlier predictions that the proteins comprise two Rossmann-fold like domains in which the acceptor is bound by the N-terminal domain and the sugar donor is recognised by conserved residues within the signature motif of the C-terminal domain; catalysis occurs at the domain interface [15e17]. Importantly, these new structural data provide a rational basis for exploring the kinetic contribution of the different domains of plant Family 1 GTs. To investigate the parameters of substrate affinities and catalytic turnover, we have used our knowledge and detailed phylogenetic analyses of the Family 1 GTs identified in the model plant A. thaliana [18,19]. In an earlier study [20], we found that many recombinant arabidopsis GTs were capable of transferring glucose from UDP-Glc onto the hydroxyl group of the acceptor scopoletin (Fig. 1a). Within the phylogenetic group E of the mutigene family, the 71C clade was found to be particularly interesting since only one GT, 71C1, displayed high specific activity towards the substrate. The remaining four GTs, 71C2 to 71C5, whilst having high sequence similarity to 71C1 expressed significantly lower specific activity towards scopoletin (Fig. 1b). This understanding has enabled us now to

2.3. Enzyme activity assay of recombinant GTs A typical GT activity assay for the kinetic study involved varied concentrations of UDP-Glc (0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mM) and scopoletin (25e500 mM) in the presence of 50 mM Trise HCl (pH 7.0), 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mg (71C1) or 1.0 mg (GTs 71C1 (NotI), 71C3 and N1C3) of recombinant protein in 200 ml reaction volumes. Samples were incubated at 30  C over a time course and stopped at appropriate timepoints by the addition of 20 ml trichloroacetic acid (240 mg ml¿1), quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ¿20  C. The reaction mixtures were analysed using reverse phase HPLC as described previously [20]. All assays were carried out on at least three independent protein preparations. 2.4. Kinetic studies of recombinant GTs The kinetic study was carried out by measuring the initial reaction rates of five different scopoletin concentrations against three different concentrations of UDP-Glc at four time-points. In each assay the increase of scopoletin glucoside formed by GTs during the reaction was determined using RPHPLC and was plotted against the time involved. The initial velocity of each enzymatic reaction was then plotted together with the substrate concentration in a double reciprocal plot following the method of Lineweaver and Burk [24]. The secondary plots of the slopes and intercepts of the double reciprocal plots were then made in order to determine the parameters KScopoletin, KUDP-Glc and Vmax, according to the modified equation by KingeAltman that allows the calculation of the kinetic parameters for bi-bi substrate reactions [25]. 3. Results From the earlier study, 71C1 displayed high specific activity towards scopoletin (22.6 nkat mg¿1), whilst 71C3, with 81% sequence similarity to 71C1 showed only low activity (0.5 nkat mg¿1) [20]. These two enzymes were chosen for domain swapping and detailed kinetic analyses of the two wild-type proteins and the mutant GTs were carried out. 3.1. Domain swapping of 71C1 and 71C3 and kinetic analyses of the chimeric mutants The putative linker regions joining the N- and C-terminal domains of 71C1 and 71C3 were identified by comparing the predicted secondary structures of the two GTs [26] to the crystal structure of the bacterial Family 1 GT, GtfA (40% amino acid similarity to 71C1) and a recently solved crystal structure of the plant Family 1 GT, 71G1 (65% amino acid similarity to 71C1) from Medicago truncatula [9,14]. A unique NotI restriction site was introduced into the linker regions of both ORFs by PCR, resulting in two amino acid changes in each GT as highlighted in Fig. 2. Whilst the mutations in 71C1(NotI) were conservative substitutions (D / N and E / Q), the changes in 71C3(NotI) led to a conservative substitution (D / N) as well as a non-conservative

undertake a domain swapping approach and detailed kinetic analyses to explore the contributions of the N- and C-terminal domains to substrate recognition and catalysis. In turn, the data will provide new insights for the future engineering of hybrid GT biocatalysts by assembling N- and C-terminal domains with different substrate affinities and kinetic properties. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site-directed mutagenesis of GTs 71C1 and 71C3 Site-directed mutagenesis for the introduction of a NotI restriction sites into the ORFs of GTs 71C1 (gene accession: At2g29750) and 71C3 (gene accession: At1g07260) were performed using a PCR approach. The PCR reaction mix contained 1¬ pfu reaction buffer (Promega), 100 ng of reverse and forward primers (Table SI, Supplementary Information), 50 ng template DNA, 0.2 mM dNTP mix (Bioline) and 5 U of pfu polymerase (Promega). The PCR reaction was performed on a peltier thermocycler (MJ Research) that had been set to the conditions shown in Table SII (Supplementary Information). 2.2. Purification of recombinant GTs Recombinant and mutant GTs were expressed as fusion proteins tagged with a 26 kDa GST protein at the N-terminus [21,22]. Escherichia coli BL21 cultures expressing the recombinant GTs were grown under the conditions as described previously [20]. Bacterial cells were disrupted by mechanical forces using a single pass through a French Press (Thermo IEC, 15,000 psi). Recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using GST-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously [20,23]. All purified GTs were analysed by 10% SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis concomitant with a pre-stained reference protein marker (NEB, broad range 6e175 kDa). Protein concentrations were measured with the BioRad assay using bovine serum albumin as reference.

substitution (S / L). This restriction site enabled the exchange of domains and construction of two chimeras: N1C3 for which the N-terminal domain of 71C1 is fused to the C-terminal domain of 71C3 and N3C1 with the opposite fragment combination (Fig. 2). The wild-type GTs and their mutants were expressed as GST-GT fusion proteins in E. coli, purified using GST affinity chromatography and their purity confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. S1, Supplementary Information). In each case a single polypeptide of w80 kDa was observed, but the yields of the different recombinant proteins varied greatly. The yields of 71C1, 71C1(NotI) and the chimera N1C3 were typically high (1.7 mg l¿1e1.8 mg l¿1), whereas 71C3 and the mutant 71C3(NotI) were much lower (0.3 mg l¿1e0.6 mg l¿1) and only trace levels of soluble protein for the chimera N3C1 were ever recovered. When 71C3(NotI) and N3C1 were assayed for activity towards scopoletin under a wide range of conditions, no activity was ever observed (data not shown). 3.2. Kinetic analyses of wild-type and mutant GTs The kinetic parameters of 71C1, 71C3, 71C1(NotI) and N1C3 were analysed using variations in the concentrations of both donor and acceptor substrates. The details of the analyses are provided in Figs. S2eS5 (Supplementary Information). The double reciprocal plots shown in Figs. S2beS5b illustrate that an increase of UDP-Glc concentration led to

a decrease in the slope and the intercepts resulting in a nonparallel pattern. This suggested that both scopoletin and UDP-Glc bound to the enzyme before the catalytic event in a random bi-bi substrate reaction manner [27,28]. The data derived from the kinetic analyses are given in Table 1. It can be seen that all four GTs showed similar MichaeliseMenten constants (KA) for the acceptor substrate scopoletin. Wild-type 71C1 and 71C1(NotI) exhibited similar MichaeliseMenten constants (KB) for the sugar donor UDPGlc. However, the chimera N1C3 displayed a three-fold higher affinity towards UDP-Glc than 71C1 and 71C1(NotI) respectively, and this affinity was near identical to that displayed by wild-type 71C3. The turnover number (kcat) of the chimera N1C3 was found to be 10-fold lower than that of 71C1 and 71C1(NotI), but significantly (19-fold) higher than that of wild-type 71C3. In summary, the construction of the chimera N1C3, in which the N-terminal of 71C1 is fused to the C-terminal of 71C3, led to a changed catalytic efficiency. The new engineered enzyme was improved relative to wildtype 71C3, but did not display the efficiency of 71C1. 4. Discussion The design of novel biocatalysts through the dissection and assembly of domains with unique functionalities or substrate selectivity is regarded as a long-term ambition for synthetic biochemists [29]. This study provides a basis for protein

engineering to create GTs with novel acceptor and sugar donor selectivity, as well as to improve the substrate affinity of the enzymes. To-date, the crystal structures of ten Family 1 GTs have been solved. These include six bacterial GTs [6,7,9e11] three plant GTs [8,13,14] and one mammalian GT [12]. All of these structures have been shown to be members of the GT-B superfamily in which the acceptor is bound by the N-terminal domain and the sugar donor by the C-terminal domain of the protein. Whilst there is no structure available for any Family 1 GT from A. thaliana, the GT71G1 from Medicago truncatula [14] shows high sequence identity towards the arabidopsis GTs 71C1 and 71C3 used in this study. This similarity together with the prediction of the secondary structures of the two enzymes provided a useful foundation for the engineering approach applied. One other study has explored the impact of domain swapping on the substrate selectivity of a Family 1 GT [30]. Mackenzie and co-workers investigated the architecture of two Family 1 glucuronosyltransferases: chimeras were constructed in which the N-terminal domains were exchanged. The results indicated that the N-terminal domains were responsible for substrate specificity. No kinetic analysis was performed. This report illustrates that domain swapping can be used to alter catalytic efficiency in addition to changes in substrate affinity. Since GTs catalyse a two-substrate reaction, the kinetic analyses were performed by varying the concentration of the acceptor scopoletin and the donor UDP-Glc. The results showed that both wild-type and mutant GTs have similar affinities towards the aglycone scopoletin. Neither the introduction of the restriction site NotI nor the fusion of the N-terminal domain of 71C1 to the C-terminal domain of 71C3 had an impact on the enzyme affinity towards scopoletin. More interestingly, the higher affinity towards UDP-Glc from 71C3 was transferred to the chimera N1C3 after the domain swap and clearly indicated that the UDP-Glc affinity is associated with the Cterminal domain of the protein. The results in this study also revealed that the higher specific activity of 71C1 compared to 71C3 towards scopoletin is determined by the high kcat of the reaction [20]. This has a substantial impact on the enzyme catalytic efficiency (kcat/Kscopoletin and kcat/KUDP-Glc). Unfortunately the chimera N1C3 did not inherit the high catalytic efficiency from 71C1, but the efficiency was significantly higher than 71C3. A possible explanation may be provided in the structural analysis of the plant Family 1 GT, VvGT1 [13]. In the structure, the reactive hydroxyl group of the acceptor ∞ was found to be 4 A from the C1 position of the glucose moiety of UDP-2FGlc. Therefore, a nucleophilic attack of the acceptor onto the sugar donor to form the transition state required an approach of both domains for the formation of the glycoside. In the context of data in this report, a lower kcat of N1C3 compared to the parental GT 71C1, could be explained by an imperfect interplay between the two domains of the chimera hindering the realisation of the transition state. The mutant GTs, 71C3(NotI) and N3C1, prepared in this study were found to be inactive towards scopoletin. In future studies it will be interesting to determine whether all of the

mutants we have constructed have changed activity towards other substrates beyond scopoletin. In summary, this research suggests that the domains of the arabidopsis GTs 71C1 and 71C3 can be regarded as independent modules each bestowing separate acceptor and sugar donor affinities. The findings are relevant to understand the structural features that will determine the catalytic properties of novel GT biocatalysts.
