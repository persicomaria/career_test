Nikolai Naryshkin, Andrey Revyakin, Younggyu Kim, Vladimir Mekler, and Richard H. Ebright* Howard Hughes Medical Institute Waksman Institute Department of Chemistry Rutgers University Piscataway, New Jersey 08854 protein family, and is by far the best-characterized member of this protein family, bacterial RNAP is the model of choice for detailed structural and mechanistic studies. A crystallographic structure of Escherichia coli RNAP ° core enzyme has been determined at 12 A resolution (Darst et al., 1998a, 1998b), and, during the last year, a crystallographic structure of Thermus aquaticus RNAP ° core enzyme has been determined at 3.3 A resolution--a resolution that permits identification of positions of individual atoms (Zhang et al., 1999). E. coli and T. aquaticus RNAP subunits exhibit extensive sequence similarity (Zhang et al., 1999), and the structures of E. coli RNAP ° core enzyme at 12 A and T. aquaticus RNAP core en° zyme at 3.3 A are superimposable in detail (Zhang et al., 1999; Opalka et al., 2000)--not only in overall contours, but also in positions of specific regions (Opalka et al., 2000). Therefore, the structure of E. coli RNAP--the best-characterized bacterial RNAP, and the focus of this report--can be homology modeled with high confidence based on the structure of T. aquaticus RNAP. ° RNAP core enzyme has dimensions of 150 A ° ° 115 A 100 A and has a shape reminiscent of a crab claw (Zhang et al., 1999). The two "pincers" of the "claw" define a cleft. The cleft has the active-center ° Mg2 at its base and has a diameter of 25 A--a diameter that can accommodate a double-stranded nucleic acid. Thus, the cleft presumably serves as the activecenter cleft and as at least part of the binding site for double-stranded nucleic acid. The subunit makes up one pincer and part of the base of the cleft. The subunit makes up the other pincer and part of the base of the cleft. The two identical subunits are located distal to the cleft. One subunit interacts with ; this subunit is designated I. The other subunit interacts with ; this subunit is designated II. The subunit also is located distal to the cleft, near the base of the pincer consisting of , and interacts exclusively with . Each subunit consists of two domains: an N-terminal domain ( NTD) responsible for interaction with and , and a C-terminal domain ( CTD) responsible for sequence-specific protein­DNA interaction with upstream promoter DNA and protein­protein interactions with upstream-bound activators and repressors (Busby and Ebright, 1994). CTD is connected to NTD, and thus to the remainder of RNAP, through a long, flexible linker (Busby and Ebright, 1994). The linker allows CTD to occupy different positions relative to the remainder of RNAP in different promoter contexts (Busby and Ebright, 1994). In the crystallographic structures of RNAP, CTD is not resolved (presumably due to segmental disorder, reflecting the fact that the linker allows CTD to occupy different positions relative to the remainder of RNAP in different molecules in the crystal lattice; Darst et al., 1998a, 1998b; Zhang et al., 1999). However, one can estimate the range of possible positions of CTD relative to the remainder of RNAP, based on the positions of the C-terminal residues of NTDI and NTDII (Zhang et al., 1999), the length of the linker (Blatter et al., 1994), and the diameter of CTD (Jeon et al., 1995).

Summary We have used systematic site-specific protein­DNA photocrosslinking to define interactions between bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and promoter DNA in the catalytically competent RNAP-promoter open complex (RPo). We have mapped more than 100 distinct crosslinks between individual segments of RNAP subunits and individual phosphates of promoter DNA. The results provide a comprehensive description of protein­DNA interactions in RPo, permit construction of a detailed model for the structure of RPo, and permit analysis of effects of a transcriptional activator on the structure of RPo. Introduction Transcription is the first step in gene expression and is the step at which most regulation of gene expression occurs. RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the enzyme responsible for transcription and is the target, directly or indirectly, of most regulation of transcription (Chamberlin, 1976; von Hippel, 1998; Nudler, 1999). RNAP is conserved in all living organisms (Young, 1991; Sentenac et al., 1992). Thus, bacterial RNAP, archaeal RNAP, and eukaryotic RNAP I, RNAP II, and RNAP III are members of a conserved protein family, termed the "multisubunit RNAP family" (Young, 1991; Sentenac et al., 1992). Members of this protein family contain a conserved subunit of 160 kDa ( in bacterial RNAP; A in archaeal RNAP; RPA1, RPB1, and RPC1 in eukaryotic RNAP I, II, and III), a conserved subunit of 150 kDa ( in bacterial RNAP; B in archaeal RNAP; RPA2, RPB2, and RPC2 in eukaryotic RNAP I, II, and III), a conserved subunit of 35 kDa ( in bacterial RNAP; D in archaeal RNAP; RPC5 in eukaryotic RNAP I and RNAP III; RPB3 in eukaryotic RNAP II), and a conserved subunit of 6 kDa ( in bacterial RNAP; K in archaeal RNAP; RPB6 in eukaryotic RNAP [L. Minakhin, D. Markov, S. Darst, K. Severinov, and R. H. E., unpublished data]). Bacterial RNAP core enzyme contains only these conserved subunits, consisting of one copy of , one copy of , two identical copies of , and one copy of . Archaeal and eukaryotic RNAP core enzymes contain these conserved subunits, but also contain additional subunits. Since bacterial RNAP is the smallest member of this

In transcription initiation, RNAP core enzyme associates with the initiation factor to form RNAP holoenzyme, binds to promoter DNA to form an RNAP-promoter closed complex (RPc), clamps down tightly on promoter DNA to yield an RNAP-promoter intermediate complex (RPi), and melts 14 nt surrounding the transcription start site, rendering accessible the genetic information in the template strand of DNA, to yield the catalytically competent RNAP-promoter open complex (RPo) (Record et al., 1996; deHaseth et al., 1998). No

high-resolution structural information has been reported for RPc, RPi, or RPo. In this work, we have used systematic site-specific protein­DNA photocrosslinking (Figure 1A; Lagrange et al., 1996, 1998; Kim et al., 1997; Naryshkin et al., 2000) to define protein-DNA interactions in RPo. Together with the crystallographic structure of RNAP core enzyme (Zhang et al., 1999), the results for the core promoter region permit construction of a detailed model for the structure of RPo. The results for the upstream promoter

region indicate that CTD makes alternative nonspecific interactions with the DNA minor grooves at positions 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93. The transcriptional activator CAP enhances interactions between CTD and the DNA minor groove at position 43, but elicits no changes in RNAP­promoter interactions in the core promoter region. Results and Discussion Site-Specific Protein­DNA Photocrosslinking Analysis of RPo Our procedure for site-specific protein­DNA photocrosslinking has four parts (Figure 1A; Lagrange et al., 1996, 1998; Kim et al., 1997; Naryshkin et al., 2000): (1) Chemical and enzymatic reactions are used to prepare a DNA fragment containing a phenyl-azide photoactivatible crosslinking agent ("probe") and an adjacent radiolabel incorporated at a single, defined DNA phos° phate (with a 9.7 A linker between the photoreactive ° atom and the phosphate, and with an 11 A maximum

"reach" between potential crosslinking targets and the phosphate). (2) The protein­DNA complex of interest is formed using the derivatized DNA fragment, and the protein­ DNA complex is UV-irradiated, initiating crosslinking with polypeptides in direct physical proximity to the probe. (3) Extensive nuclease digestion is performed, eliminating uncrosslinked DNA and converting crosslinked DNA to a crosslinked, radiolabeled 3­5 nucleotide "tag." (4) The "tagged" polypeptides are identified. The procedure is performed in systematic fashion, with preparation and analysis of a large number of derivatized DNA fragments, each having the probe incorporated at a single, defined DNA phosphate (each second ° DNA phosphate--each 12 A--on each DNA strand spanning the region of interest; Lagrange et al., 1996, 1998; Kim et al., 1997; Naryshkin et al., 2000). The results of the procedure define the translational positions of polypeptides relative to the DNA sequence. Plotted on a three-dimensional representation of a DNA helix, the

Crosslinks to (1­580), (545­878), and (821­1407) are indicated in orange, red, and navy blue; crosslinks to (1­235), (235­643), (643­989), and (951­1342) are indicated in yellow, green, cyan, and blue; crosslinks to NTD (none) and CTD are indicated in gray; and crosslinks to 70 region 1 (none), region 2, region 3, and region 4 are indicated in black.

results also define the rotational orientations of polypeptides relative to the DNA helix axis, and the groove orientations of proteins relative to the DNA major and minor grooves. For analysis of RPo, we constructed 120 derivatized DNA fragments, each having the probe incorporated at a single, defined phosphate of the lac(ICAP)UV5 promoter (positions 95 to 25; Figure 1B). For each DNA fragment, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift DNA binding experiments to verify that the probe does not alter the ability to form RPo (Figure 1C), and, for each DNA fragment derivatized in the 35 element or 10 element, we further have performed potassium permanganate DNA footprinting (Sasse-Dwight and Gralla, 1989), to verify that the probe does not alter the extent and boundaries of promoter melting (Figure 1D). For each DNA fragment, we then formed RPo, UVirradiated RPo to initiate RNAP-DNA crosslinking, and identified crosslinked RNAP subunits (Figure 2A, left lane of each panel). We then mapped crosslinks to individual segments of RNAP subunits. To map crosslinks to segments of and , we performed parallel experiments with RNAP derivatives having discontinuous, "split" or subunits (Severinov et al., 1995, 1996; Figure 2A). To map crosslinks to segments of ( NTD and CTD), we used two strategies: (1) parallel experiments with an RNAP derivative lacking CTD (Tang et al., 1995; Figure 2B), and (2)

(asparagine-glycine)-specific chemical cleavage (Allen, 1989; N. N. and R. H. E., unpublished data). To map crosslinks to segments of 70 ( 70 region 1, region 2, region 3, and region 4; Gross et al., 1992, 1998), we performed parallel experiments with RNAP derivatives containing single-cysteine mutants of 70 (Callaci et al., 1998; Owens et al., 1998a, 1998b), and performed cysteine-specific chemical cleavage (Allen, 1989; Figure 2C). Results of pilot experiments with derivatives of lac(ICAP)UV5 and derivatives of the control promoter lac(ICAP)PT743 (a null promoter with 10 element sequence 5 -TGTGTT-3 ; Reznikoff, 1984) indicated that crosslinking arising from RPo was accompanied by substantial crosslinking arising from internally bound and end-bound nonspecific RNAP-DNA complexes (Figure 2D and data not shown). To eliminate complications due to crosslinking arising from internally bound nonspecific complexes, in all experiments in Figures 2A­2C, 3, 5, and 6, we formed complexes using immobilized derivatized DNA fragments, challenged immobilized complexes with heparin (Cech and McClure, 1980; Pfeffer et al., 1977; Melancon et al., 1982, 1983), and performed crosslinking by UV-irradiating immobilized, heparin-challenged complexes in situ (Figure 2D, lanes 6 and 8). To eliminate complications due to crosslinking arising from heparin-resistant end-bound nonspecific complexes (see Melancon et al., 1982, 1983), in all experiments in Figures 2A­2C, 3, 5, and 6, we used long derivatized

DNA fragments, with 75 bp separating the promoter region under analysis from each DNA fragment end (Figure 2D, lane 8). Interactions between RNAP and the Core Promoter Region The results provide a comprehensive description of protein­DNA interactions within RPo (Figure 3). In the core promoter region (positions 25 to 35), 66 distinct crosslinks to RNAP core enzyme were observed (Figure 3). In conjunction with the structure of RNAP core enzyme (Zhang et al., 1999), these 66 crosslinks define the orientation of promoter DNA relative to RNAP, define the position and rotational phasing of the double-stranded DNA segment downstream of the melted region ("downstream duplex"), define the positions of the template and nontemplate strands within the melted region ("transcription bubble"), constrain the position and rotational phasing of the double-stranded DNA segment upstream of the melted region ("upstream duplex"), and permit construction of a structural model for RPo (Figures 3 and 4A­4C). Our results indicate that promoter DNA is oriented with its downstream end interacting with (821­1407) (Figures 4B and 4C, navy blue) and its upstream end interacting with (643­989) and (1­580) (Figures 4A­ 4C, cyan and orange). The downstream duplex binds deep within the active-center cleft (Figures 4B and 4C). The extreme downstream end of the transcription bubble--corresponding to positions 4 to 1 of the template strand and position 4 of the nontemplate strand--also binds deep within the active-center cleft (Figures 4B and 4C). The remainder of the transcription bubble rises from the floor of the active-center cleft, along an axis nearly perpendicular to the helix axis of the downstream duplex, with the upstream end of the ° transcription bubble being located 60 A from the floor of the active-center cleft (Figures 4B and 4C). The upstream duplex binds in a shallow channel distinct from the active-center cleft (Figures 4A­4C). The positions of the downstream duplex and template and nontemplate strands of the transcription bubble are defined essentially without uncertainty (and without requirement for conformational change in RNAP) (56 crosslinking constraints; Figures 3 and 4). The position of the upstream duplex of the core promoter region is less well defined (10 crosslinking constraints; Figures 3 and 4). Changes of 10 ­20 in the axial orientation of the upstream duplex could be accommodated without loss of agreement between model and crosslinking constraints and without severe steric clash; larger changes would result in loss of agreement between model and crosslinking constraints [in particular, crosslinking between position 31 of the template strand and (1­580)] and/or require conformational change in RNAP [in particular, (643­ 989) and (951­1342)]. The template strand of the transcription bubble crosslinks, along its entire length, to [ (235­643), (643­ 989), and (951­1342)], and at its extreme downstream end also to [ (545­878)] (Figure 3). The crosslinks to the template strand of the transcription bubble tightly constrain the position of the template strand within the

active-center cleft--placing the region surrounding position 1 of the template strand at the floor of the active° center cleft, 20 A from the active-center Mg2 (Figure 4D). The modeled placement of the template strand is such that it could accommodate formation of a 7- to 9-nucleotide A-form RNA-DNA hybrid (von Hippel, 1998; Nudler, 1999)--with the RNA 3 end adjacent to the active-center Mg2 , the RNA residues 2 to 6 nt from the 3 end interacting with (235­643) [which includes the binding site for the inhibitor rifampicin (Jin and Gross, 1988)], and the RNA 5 end directed toward an apparent channel, comprised by residues of and [ (643­989), (951­1342), and (1­580)], leading toward the edge of RNAP (Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, the modeled placement of the template strand is compatible both with interactions in RPo and interactions in the RNAP-DNA elongation complex. The nontemplate strand of the transcription bubble crosslinks along its entire length to [ (1­235), (235­ 643)] and, at its extreme downstream end, also to [ (545­878), (821­1407)] (Figure 3). The crosslinks tightly constrain the position of the nontemplate strand within the active-center cleft, placing the nontemplate strand along nearly its entire length within a deep, narrow groove, the walls of which are formed by (235­643), and the floor of which is formed by (1­235) (Figure 4E, green surface and yellow surface). To test the modeled placement of the nontemplate strand of the transcription bubble, we have more precisely mapped crosslinks between the nontemplate strand and (1­235), performing cysteine-specific, methionine-specific, and tryptophan-specific cleavage (Allen, 1989) to divide (1­235) into four subsegments (Figures 5A and 5B). In addition, we have performed crosslinking experiments with, and mapped crosslinks for, probes incorporated at additional positions surrounding the transcription start of the nontemplate strand (Figure 5B). The results of these experiments confirm, nucleotide by nucleotide, the modeled path of the nontemplate strand, and, more generally, the accuracy of the overall structural model (Figure 5C). The results for the core promoter region also constrain positions of segments of 70 relative to promoter DNA (19 distinct 70-DNA crosslinks observed; Figure 3). 70 region 1 does not crosslink with promoter DNA. 70 region 2 crosslinks with the 10 element, 70 region 3 crosslinks with the extended 10 element [a discrete promoter element upstream of the 10 element (Burr et al., 2000)], and 70 region 4 crosslinks with the 35 element--consistent with expectation from genetic and biochemical studies (Gross et al., 1992, 1998; Owens et al., 1998b; Bown et al., 1999). The patterns of crosslinking for 70 region 3 and region 4 also define the rotational phasing of 70 region 3 and region 4 relative to the upstream duplex. Incorporation of these results into the structural model for RPo indicates that 70 region 2 "caps" DNA in the active-center cleft, being located directly above the active-center cleft, in proximity to (643­989) and (1­580), and that 70 region 3 and region 4 are located outside of the active-center cleft, in proximity to (643­989), (951­1342), and (1­580) (Figures 4A and 4B). The model in Figure 4 is consistent with six additional

sets of results: First, the orientation of the downstream duplex relative to RNAP in the model is consistent with the orientation of the downstream duplex in the structure of a stalled tailed­template elongation complex of Sac° charomyces cerevisiae RNAP II at 20 A resolution (Poglitsch et al., 1999; Cramer et al., 2000). Second, the orientations of the downstream duplex and downstream

portion of the template strand of the transcription bubble relative to RNAP in the model are consistent with the orientations proposed based on the positions of active center, substrate binding, and inhibitor binding residues in the structure of T. aquaticus RNAP core enzyme at ° 3.3 A resolution (Zhang et al., 1999).

is consistent with biochemical data indicating that, at promoters where catabolite activator protein (CAP) interacts with a DNA site centered immediately upstream of the 35 region, residues 19­21 and 96­101 of the downstream subunit of CAP ("activating region 2") interact with residues 162­165 of NTDI ("activation target 2"; Niu et al., 1996; Busby and Ebright, 1999); thus, upon incorporation of the crystallographic structure of CAPDNA complex (Schultz et al., 1991; Parkinson et al., 1996) into the model, superimposing DNA in the crystallographic structure of the CAP-DNA complex on DNA in the model to obtain the correct register between the DNA site for CAP and the 35 region, activating region 2 is placed in direct contact with activation target 2 (R. H. E., unpublished data). Fourth, the position of 70 region 2 in the model is consistent with biochemical data indicating interaction between 70 region 2 and (260­309) (Arthur and Burgess, 1998; Arthur et al., 2000). Fifth, the position of 70 region 2 in the model is consistent with affinity cleaving data indicating proximity of 70 region 2 to (460­500) and (300­350) (Owens et al., 1998a). Sixth, the positions of 70 region 2 and 70 region 4 in the model are consistent with long-range distance constraints from fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies of interaction between 70 and RNAP core enzyme (V. M. and R. H. E., unpublished data). The data in Figures 3 and 5 and the model in Figure 4 are inconsistent with the following published data: (1) crosslinking of (1232­1273) with the downstream duplex and the nontemplate strand of the transcription bubble (Nudler et al., 1996, 1998), and (2) crosslinking of (198­237) with the nontemplate strand of the transcription bubble (Brodolin et al., 2000). In addition, the model in Figure 4 is inconsistent with the published crosslinking of (29­58) with the downstream duplex (Nudler et al., 1996, 1998). We note that the data in Figures 3 and 5 were obtained using preisolated RPo (see previous section; see also Figure 2D), whereas the data of Nudler et al. and Brodolin et al. were obtained using unresolved mixtures of specific complexes and nonspecific complexes. We further note that the crosslinks in Figures 3 and 5 were mapped using single-site

cleavage methods, whereas the crosslinks of Nudler et al. and Brodolin et al. were mapped using a less reliable multiple-site cleavage method ("ladder mapping") subject to error in cases of multiple-site crosslinking. The path of DNA relative to RNAP in the model Figure 4 is inconsistent with that in models proposed prior to the availability of high-resolution structural information for RNAP (Kim et al., 1997; Ebright, 1998; Darst et al., 1998b). Efforts to model RNAP-promoter complexes using low-resolution structures of RNAP were unsuccessful due to the absence of a critical structural feature in the low-resolution structures (a wall-like feature that truncates an apparent channel; Darst et al., 1991, 1998a, 1998b; cf. Zhang et al., 1999; Cramer et al., 2000) and to misassignment of subunit boundaries and identities in the low-resolution structures (Darst et al., 1998a, 1998b; Ebright, 1998; cf. Zhang et al., 1999; Cramer et al., 2000; Opalka et al., 2000). Interactions between RNAP and the Upstream Promoter Region In the upstream promoter region (positions 37 to 95), crosslinking involves exclusively CTD, except at position 37, where crosslinking also involves , , and 70 (25 distinct CTD-DNA crosslinks observed; Figures 2B and 3). Sites of crosslinking to CTD span fully 57 base pairs ( 37 to 93; Figure 3). Projected onto threedimensional representation of a B-form DNA helix, the crosslinks cluster in 6 discrete sets, centered on the DNA minor grooves at positions 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93 (Figure 3). In parallel experiments with an RNAP derivative having only one copy of CTD ( CTDI; Niu, 1998; Estrem et al., 1999), sites of crosslinking to CTD span 47 base pairs and occur in five discrete sets, centered on the DNA minor grooves at 43, 53, 63, 73, and -83 (Figure 3). The promoter in these experiments contains no sequence-specific determinants for binding of CTD. We infer that, in the absence of upstream sequence determinants or upstream activators, CTD interacts nonspecifically--at least transiently-- with upstream promoter DNA, making alternative nonspecific interactions with any one of the first five to

Figure 6. Effects of the Transcriptional Activator CAP on Protein­DNA Interactions within RPo In each panel, results for the nontemplate strand are shown above the sequence, and results for the template strand are shown beneath the sequence. Phosphates analyzed are indicated by asterisks. Crosslinks are indicated by bars; crosslinks significantly enhanced in the presence of CAP are indicated by bars with asterisks. Data labeled " / " are from experiments with an RNAP derivative lacking CTDII. The DNA site for CAP is centered between positions 61 and 62 and is indicated by shading.

six minor grooves upstream of the core promoter. We envision that, at any instant, in some molecules in the population, CTD will interact with the minor groove centered at position 43, in others with the minor groove centered at position 53, in others with the minor groove centered at position 63, etc. Thus, we envision the upstream promoter region, in effect, as a "keyboard" of six minor-groove "keys," with CTD "fingers" playing upon it. Incorporating the results for the upstream promoter region into the model, we infer that the DNA must bend sharply, and toward I and II, in the 40 region-- placing the upstream promoter region "keyboard," with its six minor groove "keys" from 43 to 93, within the range of the CTD "fingers" (Figure 4A, dashed lines and dashed circle). In the model in Figure 4A, the distance between posi° tions 20 and -95 is 200 A. This represents a compaction of promoter DNA in RPo relative to promoter DNA ° ° in the unbound state by 200 A [(115 bp 3.5 A/bp) ° 200 A], in agreement with the large compaction of promoter DNA observed by scanning probe microscopy (Rivetti et al., 1999). [A version of the model with an additional DNA bend of 40 , centered at position 63 and directed toward I and II, yields a compaction of ° promoter DNA of 300 A, in quantitative agreement with the extent of compaction observed by scanning probe microscopy (R. H. E., unpublished).] The model predicts

that the compaction of promoter DNA is due primarily to CTD­DNA interactions and, thus, that removal of CTD should very significantly reduce the compaction ° of promoter DNA (to 90 A). In the model in Figure 4A, promoter DNA in RPo exhibits an overall DNA bend angle of 75 , in agreement with the overall DNA bend angle observed by scanning probe microscopy (60 ­90 ; Rivetti et al., 1999). Effects of a Transcriptional Activator Catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) activates transcription at the lac promoter by binding to a DNA site spanning positions 51 to 72 and making protein­ protein interactions with CTD that facilitate binding of CTD to DNA immediately downstream of the DNA site for CAP (Busby and Ebright, 1999). To assess effects of CAP on the structural organization of RPo, we have carried out an analogous systematic site-specific protein­ DNA photocrosslinking analysis in the presence of CAP (Figures 2B and 6). Figure 6A and Figure 6B present crosslinking patterns in RPo in the absence and presence of CAP, respectively. When present, CAP crosslinks to promoter DNA between positions 43 and 85 [with the broad extent of crosslinking being attributable to CAP-induced DNA bending, which positions DNA segments flanking the DNA site for CAP close to CAP (Schultz et al., 1991;

RNA Polymerase-Promoter Open Complex 609

Parkinson et al., 1996)] (Figure 6B). CAP significantly increases crosslinking of CTD immediately downstream of the DNA site for CAP, in the minor groove centered at position 43 (Figure 2B; Figure 6B, shaded bars with asterisks). [In the presence of CAP, the CTD­ DNA crosslinking pattern in the 43 region corresponds unequivocally to a minor groove interaction--confirming the proposal made above, based on multiple sets of minor groove­centered CTD­DNA crosslinks, that CTD interacts with the DNA minor groove.] However, importantly, CAP has no effect--qualitative or quantitative--on crosslinking of RNAP with the core promoter region. The results provide support for the proposal that CAP activates transcription through a simple "recruitment" mechanism: i.e., by making an energetically favorable protein­protein interaction with CTD immediately downstream of the DNA site for CAP that stabilizes binding of CTD to promoter DNA and thereby stabilizes binding of RNAP to promoter DNA. Prospect The model for the structure of RPo presented in this work provides a structural framework for generating hypotheses, designing experiments, and interpreting results on transcription initiation and transcriptional regulation. The methods of this work can be adapted, with minor modifications, to analyze structures of the low-temperature-trapped RNAP­promoter complexes RP4 C and RP15 C--which are thought to correspond to the intermediates RPc and RPi on the pathway of transcription initiation (Record et al., 1996; deHaseth et al., 1998)--and effects of transcriptional activators and repressors on structures of these complexes (Naryshkin et al., 2000; N. N., A. R., and R. H. E., unpublished data). In addition, the methods of this work can be adapted, by use of quench-flow rapid mixing and pulsed-laser UV-irradiation, to analyze kinetics of formation of individual RNAP­ promoter interactions on entry of RNAP into promoter DNA (see Buckle et al., 1999; S. Druzhinin, N. N., and R. H. E., unpublished data).

(1­235)-RNAP was prepared as in Tang et al., 1995. I/His6[Ala45] (1­235)II-RNAP was prepared as in Niu, 1998. [Ala291; Ala295] 70-RNAP, [Ala132;Ala291;Ala295;Cys442] 70-RNAP, and [Ala132;Ala291;Ala295;Cys517] 70-RNAP were prepared by incubation of 5 M 70 derivative (Callaci et al., 1998; Owens et al., 1998a, 1998b; prepared as in Callaci et al., 1998) with 1 M RNAP core enzyme (prepared essentially as in Niu et al., 1996) in 30 l 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol, for 30 min at 37 C. CAP was prepared as in Zhang et al., 1991. DNA Fragments Biotinylated 32P-labeled derivatized DNA fragments for site-specific protein­DNA photocrosslinking [435 bp, with position 1 of lacUV5(ICAP) 265 bp from biotinylated end, for DNA fragments with probes in template strand; 342 bp, with position 1 of lacUV5(ICAP) 172 bp from biotinylated end, for DNA fragments with probes in nontemplate strand] were prepared as in Naryshkin et al. (2000),

except that the second primer was 5 -GCAAACCAGGCAAAGCGC CATTCGCC-3 , and, following primer-extension and ligation steps, products were digested with AvaII and MboII, and biotin-endlabeled using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment and biotin-14-dCTP (Life Technologies), dATP, dGTP, and TTP (Amersham-Pharmacia). 32 P-labeled derivatized DNA fragments for electrophoretic mobility shift DNA binding experiments were prepared in the same manner, but omitting the biotin-end-labeling step. 32P end­labeled derivatized DNA fragments for potassium permanganate DNA footprinting were prepared as in Naryshkin et al. (2000), using nonradioactive derivatized oligodeoxyribonucleotides, nonradioactive primer 5 -GCAAACCAGGC AAAGCGCCATTCGCC-3 , 32P end­labeled primer 5 -CGTTGCGCTC ACTGCCCGCTTTCC-3 (template-strand probes) or 5 -AAGCGGG CAGTGAGCGCAACG-3 (nontemplate-strand probes), and digestion with HhaI and EcoRI (template-strand probes) or PvuII and EcoRI (nontemplate-strand probes).

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift DNA Binding Experiments Reaction mixtures contained (20 l): 2 nM 32P-labeled DNA fragment (200 Bq/fmol) and 40 nM RNAP in transcription buffer (25 mM HEPES-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 50 g/ml BSA). Reaction mixtures were incubated 20 min at 37 C, supplemented with 1 l 1 mg/ml heparin prewarmed to 37 C, incubated 2 min at 37 C, loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) slab gel pre-run for 1 hr at 16 V/cm at 37 C, electrophoresed for 30 min at 16 V/cm at 37 C, and analyzed by autoradiography.

Potassium Permanganate DNA Footprinting Reaction mixtures contained (20 l): 2 nM 32P-end-labeled DNA fragment (200 Bq/fmol), 40 nM RNAP, and 1 mM potassium permanganate, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, and 10 mM MgCl2. Reaction components except potassium permanganate were preequilibrated 20 min at 37 C, reactions were initiated by addition of potassium permanganate, and reactions were terminated after 15 s at 37 C by addition of 10 l 1 M -mercaptoethanol and 1.5 M sodium acetate (pH 7.0). Products were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, incubated 30 min at 90 C in 10% piperidine, precipitated with 900 l 1-butanol, washed with 70% ethanol, washed with ethanol, and analyzed by urea-PAGE followed by autoradiography.

Site-Specific Protein­DNA Photocrosslinking Biotinylated 32P-labeled derivatized DNA fragments (40 fmol; 200 Bq/fmol) were incubated 10 min at 25 C with streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads [20 g; Dynabeads M-280 (Dynal); washed per manufacturer's instructions, and incubated twice for 5 min at 25 C with 20 g/ml protease inhibitor mix (Roche) and 50 g/ml BSA] in 20 l transcription buffer. Immobilized DNA fragments were washed with 20 l transcription buffer and incubated for 20 min at 37 C with 20 l transcription buffer containing 40 nM RNAP or RNAP derivative. Resulting immobilized complexes were washed with 20 l transcription buffer containing 50 g/ml heparin (2 min at 37 C), washed with 20 l transcription buffer (30 s at 37 C), resuspended in 20 l transcription buffer, and UV-irradiated for 40 s (4 mJ/mm2 at 350 nm; method as in Pendergrast et al., 1992). Crosslinked polypeptides were identified by performing nuclease digestion [20 min at 37 C, 10 units micrococcal nuclease and 10 units DNase I in 20 l transcription buffer containing 5 mM CaCl2], SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. Experiments in the presence of CAP were performed in the same manner, except that washed immobilized 32 P-labeled DNA fragments were first incubated 10 min at 37 C in 20 l transcription buffer containing 100 nM CAP and 0.2 mM cAMP and then incubated 20 min at 37 C in 20 l transcription buffer containing 40 nM RNAP or RNAP derivative, 100 nM CAP, and 0.2 mM cAMP.

Large-Scale Site-Specific Protein­DNA Photocrosslinking For mapping of crosslinks by residue-specific cleavage, site-specific protein­DNA photocrosslinking reactions were performed as above, but using 200 fmol biotinylated 32P-labeled derivatized DNA

Following SDSPAGE and autoradiography, gel slices containing crosslinked polypeptides were excised; crosslinked polypeptides were eluted by incubation for 15 hr at 37 C in 200 l 0.1% SDS, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 g unmodified polypeptide; and crosslinked polypeptides were precipitated with acetone as in Hager and Burgess, 1980 [for (asparagine-glycine)-specific, methionine-specific, and tryptophan-specific cleavage] or lyophilized (for cysteine-specific cleavage). (Asparagine-Glycine)-Specific Cleavage Crosslinked polypeptides were cleaved with hydroxylamine as in Smith (1996), except that 200 mM potassium carbonate (pH 9.0) was replaced with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Cleavage products were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Cysteine-Specific Cleavage Crosslinked polypeptides were dissolved in 20 l 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 8 M urea, and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, incubated 15 min at 65 C; incubated 15 min at 37 C, supplemented with 2 l 0.5 M 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid in ethanol, supplemented with 0.5 l 1 M NaOH (final pH 8.0­8.2), incubated 15 min at 37 C, supplemented with 2.5 l 1 M NaOH (final pH 9.0­9.2), and incubated 16 hr at 37 C. Cleavage products were analyzed by SDSPAGE followed by autoradiography.

Cleavage reactions were terminated after 2 hr at 37 C as in Grachev et al. (1987), and cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Tryptophan-Specific Cleavage Crosslinked polypeptides were cleaved with o-iodosobenzoic acid as in Fontana et al. (1983), except that the reaction volume was 20 l and the reaction temperature was 37 C. Cleavage products were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Acknowledgments We thank Dr. S.
