Mkrtchian2 1 Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics 2 Division of Molecular Toxicology Institute of Environmental Medicine Karolinska Institute 171 77 Stockholm Sweden 3 Biomedical Research and Study Center of Latvian University LV-1067 Riga Latvia Introduction Protein maturation in the luminal compartment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is accomplished by the tight network of molecular chaperones and folding enzymes assisting in the import, folding, and assembly of the nascent polypeptides and securing the proper quality control of the proteins exiting from the ER [1, 2]. The most abundant folding enzyme of the ER is protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which catalyzes the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds but may also act as a general chaperone [3]. The family of eukaryotic PDIs includes ERp72, ERp57, P5, PDIp, and PDIR [4]. A recent and unusual addition to this family is a redox-inactive and ubiquitously expressed rat endoplasmic reticulum protein, ERp29 [5­7]. After cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide, mature ERp29 contains 228 residues (Figure 1). It forms a 51 kDa homodimer and also higher oligomers both in vivo and in vitro [8]. Amino acid sequence comparisons predict the presence of a thioredoxin-like N-terminal domain in ERp29 and a helical C-terminal domain of unknown fold. The sequences of both domains align with sequences found in the group of P5-like PDIs (also termed PDI-D [4]) from plants (Medicago sativa [alfalfa], Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, and others) and amoebae (Dictyostelium discoideum) (Figure 1). In contrast to these proteins, ERp29 does not contain the activesite double-cysteine motif which is a hallmark of redoxactive PDIs. ERp29 is conserved among mammalians, including humans [9, 10]. In addition, the windbeutel gene product from Drosophila is highly similar to ERp29 ( 30% sequence identity) and lacks the double-cysteine motif at the canonical location, while a double-cysteine motif of unknown function appears near the amino terminus (Figure 1) [11]. The Windbeutel protein has been shown to act as a dedicated chaperone in facilitating the function and specific Golgi targeting of Pipe, a putative oligosaccharide-modifying enzyme essential for embryonic development [12]. While the function of ERp29 cannot be predicted from its amino acid sequence, growing evidence suggests its involvement in the protein maturation and/or secretion processes in the ER, in analogy to the Drosophila homolog Windbeutel. It is induced in certain cell types under stress conditions characterized by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER and elevated levels of molecular chaperones [7]. In rat enamel cells and other secretory cells, ERp29 levels may reach those of the major chaperones and folding enzymes of the ER [10]. The human ortholog of ERp29, ERp28 (Figure 1), can be coimmunoprecipitated with overexpressed hepatitis B small surface antigen [9]. Similarly, ERp29 has been found to associate with the misfolded isoform of immunoglobulin light chains (S.M., unpublished data) and with the transport-incompetent form of immunoglobulin

Summary Background: ERp29 is a ubiquitously expressed rat endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein conserved in mammalian species. Fold predictions suggest the presence of a thioredoxin-like domain homologous to the a domain of human protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and a helical domain similar to the C-terminal domain of P5-like PDIs. As ERp29 lacks the double-cysteine motif essential for PDI redox activity, it is suggested to play a role in protein maturation and/or secretion related to the chaperone function of PDI. ERp29 self-associates into 51 kDa dimers and also higher oligomers.

Results: 3D structures of the N- and C-terminal domains determined by NMR spectroscopy confirmed the thioredoxin fold for the N-terminal domain and yielded a novel all-helical fold for the C-terminal domain. Studies of the full-length protein revealed a short, flexible linker between the two domains, homodimerization by the N-terminal domain, and the presence of interaction sites for the formation of higher molecular weight oligomers. A gadolinium-based relaxation agent is shown to present a sensitive tool for the identification of macromolecular interfaces by NMR.

Conclusions: ERp29 is the first eukaryotic PDI-related protein for which the structures of all domains have been determined. Furthermore, an experimental model of the full-length protein and its association states was established. It is the first example of a protein where the thioredoxin fold was found to act as a specific homodimerization module, without covalent linkages or supporting interactions by further domains. A homodimerization module similar as in ERp29 may also be present in homodimeric human PDI.

Results and Discussion Protein Expression Full-length ERp29 (residues 33­260) was expressed as a 27 kDa construct with the N-terminal His tag sequence MRGSHHHHHHGS. Two additional constructs were designed, comprising the individual domains with N-terminal His-tag. The N-terminal domain (Leu33­Met154) was expressed with the same tag as the full-length protein. The construct of the C-terminal domain (Met154­ Leu260) was preceded by the tag sequence MRGS HHHHHHGIR. Whereas the C-terminal domain was readily expressed in E. coli, the N-terminal domain expressed poorly and was prone to irreversible precipitation. Therefore, NMR samples of the N-terminal domain were prepared by the expression of full-length ERp29 followed by chemical cleavage at Cys157 by the cysteine-specific reagent NTCB and purification as described in Experimental Procedures. The presence of the Histag did not interfere much with the NMR analysis, as no clear cross peaks could be observed for any of the histidine protons.

to a range of different proteins and suggest a role similar to human PDI, which can assist protein folding in a disulfide-independent manner [14, 15]. Only limited structural information is available on PDIs. Crystal structures have been determined of the PDI from Pyrococcus furiosus [16] and of E. coli DsbA [17] and DsbC [18]. The latter two proteins do not possess all of PDI's activities but are involved in disulfide bond processing in a similar way as eukaryotic PDIs. Besides human PDI, only DsbC displays additional chaperone activity [19]. The structures of the a and b domains of human PDI have been solved individually by NMR spectroscopy [20­22], and progress toward structure determinations of the a and b domains has been reported [23, 24]. To provide a basis for further functional studies, we determined the three-dimensional structure of ERp29 (Figure 2). Initial attempts to crystallize ERp29 failed. Consequently, we have determined the three-dimensional structures of the N- and C-terminal domains separately by NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the full-length protein was studied to identify the dimerization domain and interface, interdomain mobility, and sites involved in the formation of higher oligomers. ERp29 presents one of the largest systems that has been studied by NMR spectroscopy at this level of detail.

Structure of the N-Terminal Domain of ERp29 The structure of the N-terminal domain of ERp29 was determined in aqueous solution at pH 4.9, 31 C, using protein concentrations of about 0.5 mM. Although the NMR signals were broader than expected for a monomeric protein (Figure 3), no intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) could be identified without ambiguity, as the analysis of weak NOEs was hampered by spectral overlap encountered in the two-dimensional (2D) NOESY spectra, the presence of impurities, and insufficient sensitivity in the 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra. Thus, all distance restraints were taken as arising from a monomer, and the structure at the dimer interface may be distorted as a result. The NMR structure of the N-terminal domain of ERp29 (Figures 2 and 4) resembles the a domain of human PDI, with helices for residues 43­52, 71­82, 100­108, 138­148, and strands for residues 55­60, 86­90, and 117­121. The three-stranded sheet is extended on either side by hydrogen bonds between residues 39 and 88 and between 120 and 130, but too few residues of these outer peptide segments align to define a proper five-stranded sheet as in thioredoxin or the PDI a domain. The structure is well defined for residues 35­152. Broad line shapes and no long-range NOEs were observed for the residues outside this region, suggesting increased mobility. All peptide bonds of the NMR structure are in trans orientation. In particular, Pro116 was modeled with a trans peptide bond, although only one of the two sequential d NOEs seemed to be intense, and the absence of a sequential d NOE could not be verified, due to overlap with t1 noise from the residual water resonance. This residue is conserved between ERp29 and PDIs (Figure 1) and forms a cis peptide bond in most thioredoxin-like domains. trans peptide bonds have, however, also been observed. Examples are glutathione peroxidase [25] and the spliceosomal protein U5 [26], where the corresponding residues are nonproline

residues, and the third domain of calsequestrin, which has a proline at this position [27]. Like in ERp29, the thioredoxin-like domains of all these proteins are devoid of the redox-active Cys-X-X-Cys motif. When thioredoxin and glutaredoxin bind peptides via a disulfide bridge to the Cys-X-X-Cys sequence, additional contacts take place at a site located between this motif and the cis proline corresponding to Pro116 in ERp29 [28]. There is no evidence that the corresponding site in ERp29 is involved in peptide binding or dimerization. Structure of the C-Terminal Domain of ERp29 The structure determination of the C-terminal domain of ERp29 was performed under the same conditions as that of the N-terminal domain, except that the protein concentration was about 2 mM. The widths of the NMR signals were characteristic of a monomeric protein (Figure 5). The higher solubility and narrower line widths greatly facilitated the structure determination compared to the N-terminal domain, resulting in more restraints per residue and better Ramachandran statistics (Table 1). The structure (Figures 2 and 6) contains five helices and presents a novel fold, as indicated by the failure to find any protein structure matching all helices in a search with DALI [29]. The helices comprise residues 159­170, 174­189, 196­212, 215­228, and 236­250. Very narrow resonances were observed for residues 254­260, indicating increased mobility on the subnanosecond timescale for these C-terminal residues that comprise the ER-retrieval signal peptide sequence KEEL (Figure 1). No significant line narrowing was observed for the N-terminal residues after the His-tag. Furthermore, the first

long-range NOE was observed already for Leu158, indicating a relatively rigid conformation, despite the variation observed between the different NMR conformers (Figure 6b). In many proteins with all-helical domains, the helices tend to arrange in a right-handed superhelix which can persist over many helical turns as in the structure of lytic transglycosylase (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 1QSA) [30]. The structure of the C-terminal domain of ERp29 is unusual in that the helices arrange in a supersecondary structure that is partly right handed and partly left handed. The structure presents a stable fold, as slowly exchanging amide protons could be observed for all helices after dissolving the lyophilized protein in D2O. The sequence homology between the C-terminal domains of different PDI-like proteins also suggests structural conservation, which is strongly supported by the present NMR structure. Virtually all of the buried residues of the C-terminal domain of ERp29 are hydrophobic in the homologous domains (Figure 1b), and also the salt bridges observed in ERp29 between Lys208 and Asp211, Glu220 and Arg223, Lys226 and Glu229, and Lys236 and Glu239 seem to be conserved. Glu240 in the Windbeutel protein (corresponding to the buried residue Thr248 in ERp29) may participate in a salt bridge with Arg218 (Arg223 in ERp29). Homodimerization of ERp29 Cross-linking experiments showed that ERp29 forms homodimers both in vivo and in vitro [8]. The line widths observed for the NMR signals of the individual domains

indicated that homodimerization is exclusively mediated by the N-terminal domain. This view was confirmed by a more detailed cross-linking experiment, where the cross-linked product was chemically cleaved at Cys157 and the fragments analyzed by immunoblotting using domain-specific antibodies (Figure 7a). Uncleaved monomeric and dimeric species and an additional 42 kDa band are visible on both blots (lanes 3 and 3 ), while the band of 31 kDa size is absent from the sample developed by the C-terminal domain-specific antibodies (lane 3 ). The latter band corresponds to the dimer con-

sisting of two N-terminal domains (2 15.5 kDa), whereas the 42 kDa fragment recognized by both antibodies probably contains two cross-linked N-terminal domains and one C-terminal domain, as expected for incomplete cleavage of a cross-linked dimer. No evidence for two cross-linked C-terminal domains (23 kDa) could be found. The bands of the monomeric cleaved domains were clearly resolved on the gels, confirming the specificity of the antibodies used. Several NMR experiments were performed to check for the involvement of the C-terminal domain in homodi-

merization. 15N-HSQC spectra recorded of full-length 15 N/13C/2H-labeled ERp29 at pH 4.9 showed weaker resonances for the N-terminal than for the C-terminal domain, indicating that the C-terminal domain is considerably more mobile in the dimer than the N-terminal domain. These results were confirmed by the T1(15N) relaxation times measured for the amide nitrogens of

the full-length protein, which showed on average higher values for the N- than for the C-terminal domain (Figure 8a). Furthermore, the backbone chemical shifts hardly changed between the individual domains and the fulllength protein, except for residues of the linker region.

beled N-terminal domain to 15N-labeled C-terminal domain, only minimal chemical shift changes were observed that did not indicate a unique binding site. Taken together, these data indicate a flexible linker between the two domains and no involvement of the C-terminal domain in the dimer interface. The affinity of the homodimer was determined by ESI mass spectrometry to be about 1 M at pH 4.5, based on equal peak intensities of the monomer and the dimer at a total protein concentration of 3.5 M. This affinity corresponds to less than 5% of monomeric protein at NMR concentrations (0.4­0.7 mM), explaining the con-

servation of chemical shifts between the isolated N-terminal domain and the full-length protein. At the same time, the tight dimer prevented the identification of the dimerization interface by monitoring chemical shift changes as a function of protein concentrations. An initial indication of the location of the dimer interface came from the observation of slowly exchanging amide protons in the N-terminal domain, where the backbone amides of Asp71, Phe118, Arg122, and Asp123 did not yield exchange cross peaks with the water resonance in a 3D NOESY-15N-HSQC experiment, although they are solvent accessible in the NMR struc-

ture (Figure 8c). Except for Asp71, all these residues map onto the same face of the protein which is devoid of charged residues (Figures 4, 9a, and 9b). As expected for a protein-protein interface, no rapidly exchanging amide protons were identified on this surface. However, the data are of limited value, as only a total of 14 cross peaks with the water could be identified for backbone amide protons. A more significant observation may be that the only 1H NMR resonance that could be observed for a tyrosine hydroxyl proton was that of Tyr132, indicating slow exchange with the water, although this proton is solvent exposed in the monomeric structure (Figure 9a). Independent confirmation of the dimer interface came from a novel experiment where we used the paramagnetic relaxation agent Gd(DTPA-BMA) to probe amideproton solvent accessibility in full-length ERp29. Compared to TEMPOL, which is most frequently used in studies of solvent exposure, Gd(DTPA-BMA) is effective at about 20-fold lower concentration [31]. Because of the lower concentrations needed, chances for binding of the relaxation agent to the protein backbone are reduced. Consequently, the chemical shifts are more likely to be preserved in the presence of the relaxation agent. In the case of ERp29, the HN chemical shift changed by less than 0.04 ppm in the presence of 8 mM Gd(DTPABMA), which was important for tracking the resonances in crowded spectral regions. At this concentration of relaxation agent, some of the cross peaks disappeared. For example, the NH cross peak from the side chain of Trp198 disappeared, while that of Trp144 was still visible (Figures 7b and 7c). As both side chain protons are solvent exposed in the structures of the monomeric domains, the protection of Trp144 suggests its participation in the dimerization interface. To assist with the interpretation of the experimentally observed effects of Gd(DTPA-BMA) on the backbone amides (Figure 8b), the water accessibility of the amide protons and a relaxation enhancement parameter R were calculated, using the NMR structures of the N- and C-terminal domains to predict the relaxation enhancement. Figure 8c plots the water accessibility of the amide protons, and Figure 8d presents the predicted relaxation rate enhancement of the amide protons for a uniform concentration of Gd(DTPA-BMA) in the solvent. Comparison of Figures 8b and 8c shows that water-exposed amide protons are generally relaxed more efficiently by the relaxation agent than amide protons in regular secondary structure elements. For example, all helices of the C-terminal domain are clearly separated by loop regions that are sensitive to the relaxation agent. The same holds, in principle, for the N-terminal domain. Although the amide protons in the loop between helix 2 and strand 2 are not very water accessible, an increased relaxation rate is expected based on Figure 8d. The polypeptide segment between helices 3 and 4 is the only region, where Gd(DTPA-BMA) does not completely suppress any of the amide-proton cross peaks. The amide protons between helix 3 and strand 3 are not very solvent exposed, but Figure 8d would predict a similar relaxivity as for the loop between helix 2 and strand 2, based on a monomeric model. These data thus indicate protection of residues 109­137 in the dimer. While the correlation between experimental and pre-

The figure shows the average of the predictions calculated for all NMR conformers in arbitrary units.

dicted relaxation enhancement provides good qualitative criteria for the identification of interaction sites, the correlation is not quantitative. Notably, the experimental intensity ratios (Figure 8b) vary more strongly between exposed and protected amides than predicted for a simply distance-dependent effect (Figure 8d). Therefore, water accessibility of the amide protons (Figure 8c) is a helpful additional parameter for the interpretation of relaxation enhancement data, as the signals from waterexposed amide protons seem to be reliably attenuated by the relaxation agent. An exception is Gly92 HN, which is water accessible (Figure 8c) but not easily approached by Gd(DTPA-BMA) (Figure 8d). Another exception is the linker residues between the N- and C-terminal domains, where discrepancies arise from the fact that the solvent exposure was calculated for the individual domains rather than for a model of full-length ERp29. Similarly,

the discrepancy between predicted and observed relaxation enhancement for the amides of Ser189 and Lys231 may reflect proximity of the N-terminal domain in the full-length protein. The proton exchange data and amide protons for which little relaxation enhancement by Gd(DTPA-BMA) was observed despite water accessibility predicted from monomeric structures (Figure 9a) identify the same protein surface as the dimerization interface. Unfortunately, the dimer structure could not be refined by residual dipolar couplings, as ERp29 was precipitated by lamellar phases [32] and associated tightly with Pf1 phages [33]. Similarly, saturation transfer experiments in mixtures of unlabeled and 15N/2H-labeled ERp29 [34] were unsuccessful due to insufficient sensitivity. The overall charge distribution of the N-terminal domain and shape complementarity suggests a dimer

structure as shown in Figure 9c. Additional support for placement of the C-terminal domains at opposite ends comes from results using spin-labeled ERp29 (see below). Multimerization of ERp29 Dynamic light scattering (data not shown) as well as cross-linking experiments (Figure 7a) [8] indicated multimerization of a fraction of ERp29 into high-molecular weight complexes. For further characterization of the self-association of ERp29, 15N/13C/2H-labeled ERp29 was mixed with an excess of unlabeled ERp29 that had been spin-labeled at Cys157 by the stable nitroxyl radical 4-maleimido-TEMPO. While the amide cross-peak intensities varied less than 1.5-fold between the 15NHSQC spectra with and without the spin-labeled ERp29, the cross peaks of residues 67, 68, 97, and 98 were attenuated more than 2.5-fold in the presence of spinlabeled ERp29. Figure 9c shows that these residues are located near the ends of a groove that does not participate in the dimer interface, suggesting that this groove is involved in multimerization. Furthermore, resi° dues 67 and 68 are located more than 20 A apart from residues 97 and 98, indicating the presence of more than one binding mode, as expected for nonspecific self-association. The absence of any other significant relaxation enhancement by spin-labeled ERp29 further supports the dimer model of Figure 9c, where a spin

label at residue 157 would be positioned too far from the N- and C-terminal domains of the other molecule in the dimer to exert any significant relaxation effect. Structure-Function Comparison between ERp29 and PDI In Figure 1a, the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal domain of ERp29 and a and b domains of human PDI were aligned using the corresponding secondary structure elements observed in the respective three-dimensional structures. This alignment results in about 21% sequence identity between the N-terminal domain of ERp29 and the a domain of PDI. This similarity extends to their 3D structures; a combinatorial extension search of the PDB [35] yielded the a domain of human PDI as the protein that is structurally most similar to the ° N-terminal domain of ERp29, with a rmsd of 2.8 A for 105 aligned residues. The C-terminal domain of ERp29 revealed a novel fivehelix fold that is apparently conserved also in the group of P5-like PDIs and the Windbeutel protein from Drosophila. For the P5-like PDIs, which lack the C-terminal ER-retrieval signal KDEL, the importance of the C-terminal domain for retention in the ER was demonstrated by deletion mutations disrupting its structural integrity [36]. The C-terminal domain of ERp29 could play a similar role, although its C-terminal tetrapeptide KEEL may be sufficient for effective retention of the protein in the ER.

The amino acid sequence homology of the N-terminal domain of ERp29 is even greater to the thioredoxin-like domains of the P5-like PDIs than to the a domain of human PDI (23%­25% identity; Figure 1). While the functions of ERp29 and P5-like PDIs very likely overlap, only limited biochemical data are available for these PDIs. The most studied protein disulfide isomerase is human PDI. It is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the formation of correct disulfide bonds in oxidation/ reduction equilibria [3]. In addition, PDI has been found as a subunit of larger protein complexes in prolyl-4hydroxylase [37] and triglyceride transfer protein [38], where its role seems to be purely structural, similar to bacterial thioredoxin in the T7 DNA polymerase complex [39]. Finally, human PDI has been shown to possess a general chaperone activity that is independent of its redox activity [14, 15]. Like all PDIs, the redox-active domains of human PDI contain a Cys-X-X-Cys motif near the amino terminus of helix 2. This motif is absent in ERp29. Correspondingly, ERp29 did not display any thiol/disulfide oxido-reductase activity in an assay for the oxidative refolding of reduced RNase (S.M., unpublished data). It was also inactive in a CDNB (1-chloro-2,4dinitrobenzene) assay, which probes for glutathione-Stransferase (GST) activity (S.M., unpublished data). To date, neither ERp29 nor its human homolog ERp28 have been found as integral structural components of stable multiprotein complexes. Therefore, the chaperone role of PDI remains as the only plausible function that ERp29 may share with PDI. This assumption is supported by the chaperone role reported for the ERp29 homolog Windbeutel from Drosophila [12]. While the expression of Windbeutel is spatially and temporally restricted, the mammalian protein ERp29 is expressed more widely and is capable of interacting with a broader range of proteins [7, 9], suggesting that broad substrate specificity is an essential component of the putative chaperone function of ERp29. Little is known about the functional mechanism of the chaperone activity of human PDI or the polypeptide binding sites involved. The protein comprises two redox-active (a and a ) and two redox-inactive (b and b ) thioredoxin-like domains in the sequence a-b-b -a [21]. Under physiological conditions, human PDI forms homodimers [40]. When expressed individually, all domains seem to be monomers, except for the b domain, which aggregates in aqueous solutions [23]. The major peptide binding site seems to be exclusively located in the b domain, although presence of all domains is required for full activity [41, 42]. In particular, mutations in the C-terminal part of the a domain have been shown to affect peptide binding, suggesting an intramolecular interaction between the a and b domains [43, 44]. Several of the characteristic features reported for the functionally important b domain of PDI seem to be shared by the thioredoxin-like domain of ERp29: neither domain contains a Cys-X-X-Cys motif, while both domains harbor a site for nonspecific peptide binding, which, in the case of the N-terminal domain of ERp29, causes oligomerization by interaction with the linker region between the N- and C-terminal domains. Both domains are especially prone to self-aggregation in the absence of the other domains of the wild-type protein.

Unfortunately, the sequence alignment of Figure 1 is too uncertain for the a and b domains to model their structures and homo- or heterodimers with any reliability. If human or P5-like PDIs formed a homodimer like in the dimer model of ERp29, the Cys-X-X-Cys motif would be near the interface yet accessible to substrates (Figure 9c).

Homodimerization and Chaperone Function ERp29 is the first example of a protein where a thioredoxin-like domain was found to act as a homodimerization module without supporting interactions by covalent bonds or additional contacts by other domains. The dimerization interface identified in ERp29 has so far not been observed in the thioredoxin superfamily. For example, human thioredoxin requires an intermolecular disulfide bridge for dimer formation [45, 46], and the intermolecular contacts observed in the single crystal of calsequestrin involve more than two thioredoxin-like domains [27]. The intramolecular contacts observed between the two covalently linked thioredoxin-like domains of Pyrococcus furiosus PDI are also different from the interface identified for ERp29 [16]. GST [47] and DsbC [18] also form dimers but show no extensive contacts between the thioredoxin-like domains. All these examples demonstrate that the thioredoxin fold presents a module highly suitable for protein-protein interactions while avoiding noncovalent homodimerization. Homodimerization and multimer formation has been observed for many chaperones (BiP [48], GRP94 [49], HSP70 [50], small heat shock proteins [51], DsbC [17]). The role of aggregation for chaperone function is still uncertain, although oligomerization obviously increases the surface area available for the binding of extended polypeptide chains and may generate new binding clefts at the dimer interface. In the case of bacterial HSP70, DnaK, an all-helical C-terminal domain is connected to the substrate binding domain via a flexible segment that allows coverage of the peptide binding site by the helical domain [52]. The linker between the two domains of ERp29 is different in that it is flexible but too short for any intramolecular contacts between the two domains that are not in the immediate vicinity of the linker (Figure 2). In the search for a potential peptide binding site, we noticed that the C-terminal domain of ERp29 partially exposes a number of hydrophobic residues to the solvent (Leu158­Ala160, Val191, Ile228) that form a surface area of uncharged residues (presenting toward the reader in Figure 6c). This feature, however, is not conserved between related C-terminal domains (Figure 1b), and there is no evidence that it supports ligand binding in ERp29. In particular, we observed no chemical shift changes after addition of model peptides (mastoparan and somatostatin) to a sample of the C-terminal domain (data not shown). A much more likely ligand binding site is presented by the multimerization sites in the N-terminal domain, which were detected by the TEMPOlabeling experiment. Binding to these sites was nonspecific and involved residues from the flexible linker segment, suggesting that other unfolded peptide chains might associate to the same sites. Interestingly, some

Structure 468

chaperones have been found to self-associate via their peptide binding sites and to dissociate upon binding to unfolded substrates [53, 54]. A competition between homoassociation between dimers of ERp29 and heteroassociation between ERp29 dimers and unfolded peptide chains would bear strong similarities to the association behavior of other chaperones. While chaperone function requires the capability of binding a range of different polypeptides with little selectivity, the protein binding capacity must not result in irreversible self-aggregation. In the case of ERp29, the isolated N-terminal domain is much more prone to aggregation and irreversible precipitation than the fulllength protein. Possibly, solubilization of the N-terminal domain is one of the most important functions of the all-helical, highly soluble C-terminal domain. In addition, the flexibility of the hinge between the N- and C-terminal domains may have functional importance for polypeptide binding and release.

Experimental Procedures Gene Expression and Protein Purification His-tagged ERp29 was expressed in E. coli as described earlier [7]. Subcloning of the coding region of ERp29 cDNA (excluding the leader sequence) into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen) resulted in the N-terminal addition of a dodeca-peptide including six histidines. Recombinant ERp29 was expressed in the E. coli strain JM109 and purified under nondenaturing conditions on a Ni-NTAagarose affinity column according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen), followed by extensive dialysis against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. For expression of the His-tagged C-terminal domain of ERp29, the corresponding gene segment was excised as a SmHI-HindIII fragment from the recombinant pQE30 vector and inserted into the pQE32 expression vector. Uniform isotope labeling was achieved by expression in JM109 in 15N/13C double-labeled Celtone medium (Martek) and purification as described above. 15N/13C-labeled N-terminal domain was obtained by expression of full-length, His-tagged ERp29 in double-labeled Celtone medium, followed by purification of the protein and selective chemical cleavage N-terminal of Cys157. For chemical cleavage at this unique Cys residue, the protein was incubated for 2 hr at 37 C with a 100-fold molar excess of 2-nitro5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB) and subsequently incubated overnight under mild alkaline conditions (pH 9.5 and 37 C) [55]. The His-tagged N-terminal domain was separated from the untagged C-terminal fragment using the Ni-NTA-agarose affinity column. Remaining uncleaved full-length protein was removed by adsorption chromatography on a hydroxylapatite column, which retained the full-length protein but not the N-terminal domain. 15N/13C/2H-labeled ERp29 was expressed in the E. coli strain M15 using M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl, 13C-glucose, and D2O. Chemical Cross-Linking and Protein Cleavage A 10 M solution of ERp29 was incubated in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), with 200 g/ml of the homobifunctional cleavable cross-linker DSP (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. Subsequently, the protein was cleaved by NTCB as described above. The samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ERp29 raised against purified N-domain and anti-C-terminal peptide antibodies [7] were used for detection of the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. Spin Labeling A 1 mM solution of ERp29 was incubated with 1 mM DTT for 1 hr at 37 C. DTT was removed thereafter by centrifugation of the reaction mixture through a 4 ml G-25 Sepharose spin column (Pharmacia) for 5 min at 200 g. Subsequently, 4-maleimido-TEMPO (Sigma) in DMSO was added at a final concentration of 100 mM and incubated for 2 hr at ambient temperature [56]. Excess spin label was removed as above and the sample further dialyzed overnight against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). NMR Spectroscopy All NMR spectra of the N and C-terminal domains of ERp29 and of the full-length protein were recorded at 31 C and pH 4.9, using either 95% H2O/5% D2O or 100% D2O as a solvent. No NMR spectra of the N-terminal domain were recorded in 100% D2O solution, because of the strong tendency of the protein to precipitate during ultrafiltration or lyophilization. In contrast, a sample of the C-terminal domain in D2O was readily prepared by lyophilization and redissolving in 100% D2O. Protein concentrations were about 0.5 and 2 mM for the N- and C-terminal domain, respectively, and 0.3 mM for full-length ERp29. All heteronuclear NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX 500 and DMX 600 NMR spectrometers. The homonuclear NOESY spectrum of unlabeled N-terminal domain used for collection of NOE restraints (40 ms mixing time) was accumulated at 800 MHz on a Varian Unity NMR spectrometer for 1 week. Backbone-resonance assignments were achieved by three-dimensional HNCO, HNCA, and HN(CO)CA spectra [57], which were recorded with TROSY schemes [58, 59] in the case of full-length ERp29.

Biological Implications ERp29 is the first eukaryotic PDI-related protein for which the structures of all domains have been determined. The data underline the structural similarity between ERp29 and the class of P5-like PDIs. The N-terminal domain of ERp29 is also similar to the thioredoxin-like a domain of human PDI. The structural homologies to PDIs suggest overlapping functions between these and ERp29. ERp29 lacks, however, the redox-active Cys-X-X-Cys motif of conventional PDIs, and there is no evidence that ERp29, in analogy to human PDI, acts as a structural subunit of larger multiprotein complexes. Consequently, only the redox-independent chaperone function of human PDI may be shared by ERp29, which is further corroborated by the substrate-specific chaperone properties reported for the Drosophila homolog of ERp29, Windbeutel. The function of ERp29 is probably broader, as suggested by its ubiquitous expression in parallel to molecular chaperones, high concentration in many secretory cells, upregulation under conditions when misfolded protein chains accumulate in the ER, and association with a number of transport-incompetent secretory proteins. The present study revealed a noncovalent homodimer for the N-terminal domain with additional binding sites involved in multimerization of the full-length protein. These multimerization sites associate with the flexible linker region between the two domains of ERp29 in a nonspecific manner and might thus serve as a binding locus also for unfolded polypeptides. Self-association via their peptide binding sites and dissociation upon binding to unfolded substrates has been reported previously for other chaperones [53, 54]. The thioredoxin fold has not previously been observed as a homodimerization module without covalent linkages or additional contacts by other domains. Specific homodimerization and nonspecific multimerization may also account for the self-association reported for the b domain of human PDI, which has been shown to be the most important domain for peptide binding.

nance assignments were obtained from 2QF-COSY, clean TOCSY (60 ms mixing time), and NOESY (100 ms and 40 ms mixing time) spectra recorded with unlabeled samples of the domains. Ambiguities in 1H resonance assignments were further resolved by 15NHSQC and 3D NOESY-15N-HSQC spectra [60]. Stereospecific resonance assignments of the protons in the C-terminal domain were assisted by a 3D HNHB spectrum [61]. NOE distance restraints were collected from two-dimensional NOESY spectra recorded with 40 ms mixing time in H2O, using t1max 63 ms and t2max 128 ms, where the water signal was suppressed by a spinlock purge pulse before acquisition [62]. Zero-quantum coherences were suppressed by a published procedure [63], and the spectra were corrected for the nonuniform excitation profile in the F2 dimension using PROSA [64]. 3 JHN,H couplings of the N-terminal domain were measured by a CT-HMQC-HN experiment [65]. 3JH ,H couplings were estimated as 11.0 and 4.0 Hz, respectively, when COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY cross peaks indicated the presence of large and small couplings, respectively, together with staggered conformations around the C C bond. For the C-terminal domain, 3JHN,H and 3JH ,H couplings of valine, threonine, and isoleucine residues were measured by line fitting from the in-phase cross peaks observed in 15N-HSQC and NOESY spectra, respectively [66]. Error ranges of 2 and 3 Hz were assumed for all 3JHN,H and 3JH ,H couplings, respectively. T1(15N) relaxation measurements of full-length ERp29 were recorded with five 15N-HSQC-type spectra [67], using relaxation delays of 1, 100, 200, 400, and 1200 ms. SG-15N-TROSY spectra [68] were recorded to measure the relaxation enhancements of the amide resonances by the paramagnetic compound gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penataacetic acid-bismethylamide [Gd(DTPA-BMA), Nycomed] in full-length ERp29. 15 N-HSQC spectra were recorded to monitor the effect of TEMPOlabeled ERp29 at natural isotopic abundance on 15N/13C/2H-labeled ERp29. Structure Calculations The cross peaks in the NOESY spectra were assigned and integrated using the program XEASY [69]. The NMR structure was calculated using the program DYANA (version 1.5) and the associated routines CALIBA, HABAS, and GLOMSA [70]. Fifty random conformers were annealed in 30,000 steps using torsion-angle dynamics. The twenty conformers with the lowest residual restraint violations were energy minimized using the program OPAL (version 2.6) with standard parameters [71]. Table 1 shows an overview of the restraints used and structural statistics. The Ramachandran plot was analyzed using PROCHECKNMR (version 3.4) [72]. For the N-terminal domain, no , pair was found in forbidden regions for all 20 final conformers. Thr194 of the C-terminal domain was the only residue consistently found in a forbidden region. It is located in a highly solvent-exposed, irregular segment with relatively low NOE density. Secondary structure elements and rmsd values were calculated using the program MOLMOL (version 2.6) [73]. MOLMOL was also used to generate all molecular graphics figures. Acknowledgments We thank Dr. William J.
