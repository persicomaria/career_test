Jackson* * Wellcome Trust and Cancer Research Campaign Institute of Cancer and Developmental Biology, and Department of Zoology University of Cambridge Cambridge CB2 1QR  University of Cambridge Chemical Laboratory and Cambridge Centre for Protein Engineering Medical Research Council Cambridge CB2 2QH United Kingdom is essential in S. cerevisiae and is required for the DNA damage response in all phases of the cell cycle, as well as being involved in regulating replication origin firing (reviewed in Weinert, 1998). Homologs of Rad53p have been found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Cds1; Murakami and Okayama, 1995), Drosophila melanogaster (Dmnk; Oishi et al., 1998), mice, and humans (hCds1, Chk2; Matsuoka et al., 1998; Blasina et al., 1999; Brown et al., 1999). In all species examined so far, these proteins are involved in checkpoint signaling. Recent work has shown that S. cerevisiae Rad53p interacts physically with phosphorylated forms of Rad9p, a protein proposed to be a sensor of DNA damage and that acts upstream of Rad53p in the DNA damage signaling pathway (Emili, 1998; Sun et al., 1998; Vialard et al., 1998). Phosphorylation of Rad9p depends on Mec1p and Tel1p, two members of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinaselike (PIKL) protein kinase family (Zakian, 1995; Jackson, 1996). The C-terminal FHA domain of Rad53p (FHA2) mediates interactions with phosphorylated Rad9p in vitro, and this interaction requires the same regions of FHA2 as those required for the cdc13-induced checkpoint (Sun et al., 1998). Another protein containing an FHA domain is Arabidopsis KAPP. A region of KAPP containing the FHA domain is sufficient to interact with the phosphorylated form of RLK5, a receptor kinase (Stone et al., 1994; Li et al., 1999). Taken together, these data implicate the FHA domain in protein­protein interactions and suggest that, at least for the two cases studied, phosphorylation either alters the conformation of the target protein such that it can bind the FHA domain or creates a motif that binds the FHA domain directly or indirectly via an adaptor protein. In this study, we report that both FHA domains of Rad53p interact specifically with the phosphorylated forms of Rad9p that are generated after DNA damage, providing novel insights into Rad53p-dependent signaling. Moreover, we reveal that the N-terminal FHA domain of Rad53p (FHA1) binds directly to phosphorylated peptides with high specificity and affinity, define sequence determinants for this recognition, and show that mutation of residues that are conserved between FHA1 and other FHA domains abrogates binding to these phosphorylated peptides and abolishes binding to Rad9p. We also demonstrate phospho-dependent peptide binding for FHA2 and four other FHA domains. Since the six divergent FHA domains studied are derived from yeast, human, plant, and mycobacterial proteins, these findings reveal that the FHA domain is a general phosphopeptide recognition motif and suggest that phosphorylation-dependent protein interactions mediated by FHA domains play important roles in many nuclear processes and in certain prokaryotes. Results Both FHA Domains of Rad53p Interact with Phosphorylated Rad9p The essential checkpoint kinase Rad53p is currently unique among characterized proteins in that it is the

Summary FHA domains are conserved sequences of 65­100 amino acid residues found principally within eukaryotic nuclear proteins, but which also exist in certain prokaryotes. The FHA domain is thought to mediate protein­protein interactions, but its mode of action has yet to be elucidated. Here, we show that the two highly divergent FHA domains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53p, a protein kinase involved in cell cycle checkpoint control, possess phosphopeptide-binding specificity. We also demonstrate that other FHA domains bind peptides in a phospho-dependent manner. These findings indicate that the FHA domain is a phospho-specific protein­protein interaction motif and have important implications for mechanisms of intracellular signaling in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

Introduction Large-scale genomic sequencing and biocomputing have identified a substantial number of protein domains of unknown function. Elucidating the molecular roles of these domains should be instrumental in deciphering the physiological functions of the proteins harboring them. One of these domains is the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a region of 65­100 amino acid residues present in proteins from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (Hofmann and Bucher, 1995). The FHA domain is thus one of the relatively rare protein modules found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The vast majority of FHA-containing proteins in eukaryotes reside within the nucleus, and many of these have been linked to the control of transcription, DNA repair, and/or cell cycle progression. Indeed, of the FHA domain­containing polypeptides that have been characterized, only the Arabidopsis thaliana protein phosphatase KAPP seems to be cytoplasmic, and nuclear roles for this protein cannot currently be ruled out (Stone et al., 1994). It therefore seems that the FHA domain is involved primarily in nuclear processes. Rad53p is an FHA-containing protein of the calcium/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase superfamily that

only polypeptide known to have more than one FHA domain. Furthermore, the two FHA domains of Rad53p fall within two divergent branches of the FHA phylogenetic tree (data not shown). Because FHA domains have been proposed to be protein­protein interaction motifs, we decided to test for possible Rad53p FHA-binding partners. Of the proteins reported to act upstream of Rad53p, Rad9p is a particularly attractive candidate for a direct Rad53p FHA-interacting molecule because it is required for Rad53p activation in the response to DNAdamaging agents and was shown previously to interact either directly or indirectly with Rad53p in a manner that requires an intact FHA2 domain (Fay et al., 1997; Emili, 1998; Sun et al., 1998; Vialard et al., 1998). To conduct the binding studies, we generated and purified glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of FHA1 or FHA2, together with a series of mutated derivatives. The mutations employed were Ala substitutions of Arg-70 (R70), His-88 (H88), or Glu-117 (E117) of FHA1, or residue Arg605 (R605) within FHA2. Three of the mutated residues (R70A, R605A, and H88) are highly conserved among FHA domains, whereas E117 is variable and is located just at the C-terminal end of the of FHA homology region (Hofmann and Bucher, 1995). To test whether Rad9p binds to Rad53p FHA1 or FHA2, protein extracts were prepared from untreated yeast cultures and from cultures treated either with MMS or the UV-mimetic agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO; this drug generates bulky DNA adducts that are repaired mainly by the base excision repair pathway [Siede et al., 1993]). These extracts were then incubated with GST fusions of FHA1, FHA2, or FHA1(R70A) immobilized on Sepharose beads. After incubation, beads were pelleted and washed extensively, the bound protein was analyzed by Western blotting, and Rad9p was detected with an anti-Rad9p polyclonal antiserum (Vialard et al., 1998). These studies revealed that the FHA1 and FHA2 fusion proteins both bind Rad9p in the yeast extract and that, in each case, this binding is stimulated dramatically by MMS or by 4-NQO (Figure 1A). In marked contrast, the FHA1(R70A) mutant fusion protein (Figure 1A) or GST alone (data not shown) do not bind Rad9p significantly. Moreover, treatment of cells with MMS or 4-NQO leads to a proportion of Rad9p migrating more slowly, and it is only these species of Rad9p that are retrieved efficiently by the FHA1 or FHA2 fusions. Consistent with previous reports (Emili, 1998; Sun et al., 1998; Vialard et al., 1998), treatment of retrieved Rad9p with phosphatase converts it into forms that migrate more quickly (data not shown). Taken together, these data reveal that only the phosphorylated forms of Rad9p that are induced upon genotoxic insult are efficiently retrieved from yeast extracts by FHA1 or FHA2. Importantly, whereas interaction with phosphorylated Rad9p is not affected by mutation of the nonconserved FHA1 residue E117, binding is abolished by mutation of conserved residues R70A and H88A of FHA1 or by mutation of residue R605 of FHA2 (Figure 1B). The Interaction between FHA1 and Phosphorylated Rad9p Is Disrupted by Specific Phosphopeptides Although the above studies revealed a correlation between Rad9p phosphorylation and an ability to bind the Rad53p FHA domains, it was not clear whether phosphorylation played a direct role in these interactions.

Figure 1. The FHA1 Domain of Rad53p Binds to Phosphorylated Rad9p Extracts (1 mg protein) from cultures treated with MMS or 4-NQO as indicated were incubated in the presence of equal amounts (500 ng) of immobilized GST­FHA1, GST­FHA2, GST­FHA1(R70A), GST­ FHA1(H88A), GST­FHA2, or GST­FHA2(R605A), as indicated. The fusion protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-Rad9p polyclonal antiserum.

Because Rad53p functions genetically downstream of the protein kinase Mec1p and since the phosphorylation of both Rad9p and Rad53p in response to DNA damage is dependent on Mec1p function (Sanchez et al., 1996; Sun et al., 1996, 1998; Emili, 1998; Vialard et al., 1998), we speculated that FHA binding to Rad9p might require Mec1p-mediated phosphorylation of Rad9p or the Mec1p-mediated phosphorylation of an adaptor protein. If this were the case, we reasoned that the FHA­ Rad9p interaction would be disrupted by appropriate phosphopeptides. We thus tested a set of phosphopeptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of human histone H2A.X and the N-terminal region of p53--two protein regions known to be phosphorylated by kinases of the PIKL family, of which Mec1p is a member (Rogakou et al., 1998; Lakin and Jackson, 1999). The set of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides used in these studies is listed in Figure 2A. Initially, we performed competition studies. Immobilized FHA1­ or FHA2­GST fusion proteins were incubated with whole-cell extract prepared from yeast cells exposed to MMS, either alone or together with various phosphorylated or unphosphorylated peptides. The binding of phosphorylated forms of Rad9p to the FHA fusion protein was then assessed by Western blotting (Figures 2B, 2C, and 2D). Little or no competition for binding of FHA1 to Rad9p was obtained with the various unphosphorylated peptides, nor with the phosphorylated H2A.X peptide or the p53 peptide phosphorylated on serine, S(P)T. In contrast, inclusion of the p53 threonine-phosphorylated peptide, ST(P), led to a marked and reproducible diminution of Rad9p binding (Figure 2B) with an estimated IC50 of 3.4 M (Figure 2C). Binding of the FHA2 fusion protein to Rad9p, however, was competed much less efficiently, if at all, by the ST(P) peptide

Figure 3. The FHA1 Domain of Rad53p Binds Directly to Specific Phosphopeptides (A and B) Biotinylated peptide [5 ng; ST, S(P)T, ST(P), as indicated] was incubated with 50 ng of the indicated GST fusion protein. Protein­peptide complexes were retrieved using streptavidin paramagnetic beads and were separated by SDS-PAGE. Fusion proteins were detected by Western blotting using an anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Note that the multiple bands observed in the input lanes correspond to GST­FHA fusion degradation products. One degraded form of GST­FHA1 can still bind the ST(P) peptide, and this form corresponds to a C-terminal truncation of GST­FHA1 that still harbors an intact FHA domain (data not shown). (C and D) The binding of FHA1 to peptides requires a phosphothreonine and the presence of an aspartic acid at position 3. GST­FHA1 (50 ng) was incubated with 5 ng of biotinylated peptides. Peptide­ protein complexes were retrieved and analyzed as described in (A). (E) The FHA domain protects the phosphate group from phosphatase activity. protein phosphatase was added to binding reactions containing the ST(P) peptide and GST­FHA1 (FHA1) or GST­ FHA1(H88A) fusion proteins, and aliquots were taken after 30 and 60 min. Reactions were then stopped with EDTA and were spotted on nitrocellulose. The ST(P) peptide was detected by Western blotting using a phospho-specific p53 Thr18 antibody and was quantitated using the NIH image software. Each point of the graph represents the mean of a duplicate.

Note that peptides, except for the H2A.X-derived peptides, are biotinylated and contain the linker Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly between the biotin group and the N terminus of the peptide sequence given. Thr-18 of p53 has been shown to be targeted by DNA-PK, at least in vitro (N. Lakin, personal communication). (B, C, and D) Competition of the FHA1­Rad9 interaction using phosphorylated peptides. Immobilized GST­FHA1 (B and C) or GST­ FHA2 (D) was incubated in the presence of 1 mg of protein extracts prepared from MMS-treated cells, in the presence or absence of the indicated peptides. The presence of Rad9p in the FHA­protein complexes was detected by Western blotting. In (C), the Rad9p­ FHA1 interaction was competed by increasing amounts of the ST(P) peptide. The relative amount of Rad9p bound was quantitated using the NIH image software, the R square of the logarithmic regression is 0.88. The ST peptide does not compete significantly the FHA1­ Rad9p interaction at 500 M (data not shown).

(Figure 2D) and was not affected to a significant degree by the other peptides used, demonstrating that the two FHA domains have different binding specificities. Rad53p FHA1 Binds Specific Phosphopeptides with High Affinity and Selectivity The studies described above suggested that the FHA1­ Rad9p interaction requires a phosphoepitope on Rad9p, Rad53p, and/or an adaptor protein, that is competed specifically by the ST(P) peptide. We therefore decided

to see whether FHA1 can bind directly to ST(P) or any of the other phosphopeptides we employed. Thus, we employed assays in which biotinylated peptides were incubated with various soluble GST­FHA fusion proteins and the bound protein was retrieved using streptavidincoupled paramagnetic beads. After washing the beads extensively, the GST fusion proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 3A, the ST(P) peptide but neither the unphosphorylated peptide (ST) nor the S(P)T phosphopeptide specifically retrieves

the GST­FHA1 protein. This finding confirms the specificity of phosphopeptide binding observed in competition experiments (Figure 2B) and provides strong support for the notion that FHA1 binds Rad9p by direct recognition of a Rad9p phosphoepitope. The GST­FHA2 and GST­FHA1 fusion proteins containing the R70A, H88A, or E117A mutations were also tested for their ability to bind the ST(P) peptide. Consistent with the Rad9p binding studies, wild-type GST­FHA1 or GST­ FHA1(E117A), but neither GST­FHA1(R70A) nor GST­ FHA1(H88A), binds specifically to this phosphopeptide (Figure 3B). The GST­FHA2 fusion protein also does not bind to the ST(P) peptide, further suggesting that FHA2 has different binding specificity from FHA1. To investigate the interaction between FHA1 and the ST(P) phosphopeptide in more detail, we tested the effect of substituting residues surrounding the phosphothreonine with alanine and of substituting the phosphothreonine by phosphoserine (Figures 3C and 3D; peptide sequences are depicted in Figure 2A). Using the biotinylated peptide-binding assay, we observed that alanine substitution of residues 3, 2, 1, 1, or 2 (relative to the phosphothreonine) has no pronounced effect on interaction with GST­FHA1 (Figure 3C). Substitution of the Asp residue at 3 by Ala [ST(P) 3A], however, markedly decreases binding to the FHA1 domain (Figure 3C), indicating that the 3 position is a major determinant of the binding specificity. Consistent with this, a penta-alanine-substituted peptide, T(P)5A, which retains the phosphothreonine and the Asp at 3, still binds FHA1 effectively (Figure 3D). Furthermore, this interaction requires a phosphothreonine, since its substitution with the acidic amino acid aspartate abolishes the interaction (Figure 3D, peptide D5A). Perhaps surprisingly, substitution of the phosphothreonine in the original peptide for a phosphoserine, yielding peptide SS(P), also reduces FHA1 binding to background levels (Figure 3C). This implies that, at least in the context of the peptide studied, the binding of FHA1 is specific for phosphothreonine residues. Further indicative of a specific and intimate interaction with FHA1, the phosphothreonine residue can be protected from phosphatase activity by GST­FHA1 but not the H88A FHA1 mutant (Figure 3E). The FHA1 motif of Rad53p is thus a phosphopeptide-binding domain. Quantitative Analyses of FHA1­Phosphopeptide Interactions We next used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the affinity of FHA1 for the ST(P) peptide. Using this method, the affinity of the FHA1­ST(P) interaction was 1.68 M (Figure 4A). This value is very close to the IC50 derived from the competition of the FHA1­Rad9p interaction by the ST(P) peptide, suggesting that the Rad9p phosphoepitope(s) harbor similar FHA1-binding properties to the ST(P) peptide. This ITC-derived value is also comparable to those determined for other phosphopeptide-binding proteins examined previously by ITC, such as the SH2 and PTB domains (Ladbury et al., 1995; Li et al., 1997). In addition, the ITC measurements enabled us to calculate the enthalpy of binding ( H) to be 7.228 kcal/mol and to evaluate the stoichiometry of binding (N) to be 0.849 phosphopeptides per FHA1

unit in the GST­FHA1 dimer (thus 1.698 phosphopeptides per GST fusion dimer). The data fit a model in which the binding is noncooperative between the two FHA units of the GST­FHA1 dimer. To quantitatively evaluate the relative binding affinities of FHA domains and their mutated derivatives for various

1 used for measuring the FHA1­ST(P) interaction (see Experimental Procedures). This binding pattern seems to reflect two binding components, one with relatively high affinity and a second with much lower affinity. Nevertheless, even at 10 M, the binding to ST(P) 3A is not saturated, revealing that substitution of the Asp residue at 3 lowers the affinity by at least two orders of magnitude. Next, we determined the binding affinities of the E117A, H88A, and R70A mutated FHA1 derivatives for the ST(P) peptide. Consistent with our other data, the wild-type and E117A mutant proteins have comparable apparent affinities (61 nM versus 114 nM, respectively) for ST(P), whereas essentially no binding at all is observed for proteins bearing the R70A or H88A mutations (Figure 5C). The GST­FHA2 fusion also displayed virtually no binding to the ST(P) peptide (data not shown). In addition, none of the proteins tested bound to the nonphosphorylated peptide, ST (data not shown). Collectively, these results show that the FHA1 domain binds with high affinity to specific phosphopeptides but not to their unphosphorylated derivatives. Furthermore, phosphopeptide binding of FHA1 mutants correlates with the ability of these mutants to bind a biologically relevant phosphoprotein, Rad9p. Other FHA Domains Mediate Phospho-Dependent Peptide Binding The demonstration of FHA1 as a phosphopeptide-binding motif suggested that this might be a general feature of FHA domains. To investigate this possibility, we took advantage of our observation that the specificity of the peptide­FHA1 interaction resides predominantly C-terminal of the phosphoamino acid residue and mainly at the 3 position (Figures 3 and 4). Thus, we generated peptide libraries based on the ST or ST(P) peptides in which each of the three positions C-terminal to the threonine or phosphothreonine were fully degenerate for all amino acid residues (except cysteine), yielding T and T(P) peptide libraries, respectively (Figure 5A). We then bound each of these peptide libraries separately to a streptavidin-coated chip and tested, by SPR, their ability to be recognized by a series of FHA domains that had been generated in bacteria as GST fusions. For these studies, we employed Rad53p FHA1 and FHA2, together with other FHA domains derived from S. cerevisiae (Yhr115cp), Arabidopsis (KAPP), human (KIAA0170), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtuCY1A11.16C). As expected, whereas FHA1 of Rad53p did not bind appreciably to the nonphosphorylated peptide set, it bound avidly to the chip bearing the phosphorylated peptide mixture, and this binding was dependent on the critical His-88 residue (Figure 5B). The FHA2 domain was also able to bind peptides of the phosphorylated but not the unphosphorylated peptide library in a manner that was disrupted by the R605A mutation (Figure 5C). Strikingly, all the other FHA domains tested were also able to bind the immobilized peptides in a phospho-dependent manner; displaying at least 10-fold more binding toward the phosphorylated T(P) peptide library than to the unphosphorylated library (Figures 5D­5G). The extent and kinetics of T(P) binding, however, was clearly different for each FHA domain and most did not bind the ST(P) peptide (data not shown), further indicating that each FHA

The binding activity was measured by SPR and expressed as corrected resonance units (RU).

phosphopeptides, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Thus, biotinylated peptides were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated chip, and various concentrations of GST­FHA1 fusion protein were injected. As expected, peptides ST, S(P)T, and SS(P) showed no significant binding, even at high concentrations of FHA1 fusion protein (Figure 5B). The ST(P) peptide, however, bound with high affinity, with an apparent KD (dissociation constant) of 61 nM (Figure 4B). The value of this apparent KD is significantly lower than that obtained with ITC, presumably reflecting GST-mediated protein dimerization effects in the SPR analysis (Ladbury et al., 1995). Notably, T(P)5A, the penta-alanine substituted phosphothreonine peptide that retains Asp at 3, was found to have essentially the same affinity for the FHA1­GST fusion as the ST(P) peptide (apparent KD, 73 nM; Figure 4B). These results are therefore consistent with our previous data and provide further evidence for the phosphothreonine and the Asp residue at 3 being critical to generate high-affinity FHA1 binding. When we analyzed the ST(P) 3A peptide, however, it gave a complex binding pattern that could not be analyzed by Equation

domain has its own binding specificity. Taken together, these experiments indicate that the FHA domain is a modular phosphopeptide recognition motif. Discussion We have shown that FHA1 of Rad53p binds with high specificity to phosphorylated forms of Rad9p that arise after DNA damage and that these interactions are blocked by specific phosphopeptides but not by their unphosphorylated derivatives. We have further identified FHA1 as a phospho-specific binding module by demonstrating that it interacts directly with these blocking phosphopeptides with a high degree of specificity and with an affinity comparable with other interactions of established biological importance. Finally, we have shown that multiple divergent FHA domains interact specifically with peptides in a phospho-dependent manner, establishing the FHA domain as a true phosphopeptide interaction module. This mode of interaction yields insights into the mechanism of DNA damage signaling and also provides a framework for investigations into the function of a diversity of FHA domain­containing proteins. Rad53p FHA Domains in DNA Damage Signaling The ability of Rad53p to bind, via its FHA domains, to phosphoproteins during the checkpoint response leads us to propose a modified model of DNA damage signaling in which the FHA domains act as phospho-dependent protein­protein interaction motifs. Thus, through the binding of the phosphorylated docking protein, Rad9p, the FHA domains of Rad53p might locate Rad53p to putative Mec1p/Tel1p complexes, perhaps at the site of the DNA lesion itself. This, in turn, would allow very specific activation and subsequent amplification of the DNA damage signal, leading to the series of events known as the DNA damage response. This series of events is likely to also occur in humans, as the recently described human homolog of Rad53p, Chk2/hCds1, harbors a conserved FHA domain in its N terminus and is activated in a manner that is dependent on the Mec1p/ Tel1p homolog ATM (Matsuoka et al., 1998). Earlier studies by Stern and colleagues have concluded that FHA1 and FHA2 have different roles during checkpoint signaling (Fay et al., 1997; Sun et al., 1998). Although our data are also consistent with there being unique roles for the two Rad53p FHA domains, the fact that we have shown that each is able to interact with phosphorylated forms of Rad9p does suggest that they might display a significant degree of functional redundancy. Clearly, further genetic analyses are required to decipher the precise physiological roles of the two Rad53p FHA domains. Modular Phosphopeptide Recognition in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes The identification of the SH2 domain as a modular phosphotyrosine peptide recognition motif that is present on various signal transduction molecules has had a profound impact on how we now understand the propagation of extracellular signals into and through the cell

cytoplasm (Pawson and Gish, 1992; Kuriyan and Cowburn, 1997). Recognition of the FHA domain as a phosphopeptide-binding domain, together with its presence on a variety of nuclear proteins with diverse functions, might thus have a corresponding impact on our appreciation of signaling pathways emanating from and/or being activated within the eukaryotic cell nucleus. Given the extent of protein phosphorylation in eukaryotic cells and the regulatory potential of phospho-dependent interactions, it is not surprising that certain proteins, such as the transcriptional coactivator CBP and 14­3­3 proteins, have evolved modes of protein binding that are phospho-dependent (Kwok et al., 1994; Muslin et al., 1996). Moreover, during the course of evolution, small protein modules harboring phosphopeptide binding activities have arisen. Importantly, the modular nature of these domains has allowed them to be transferred onto new proteins during evolution thus imparting novel and inducible target binding specificities to such molecules. Apart from the SH2 domain, only a few protein modules have so far been characterized or proposed to bind specifically to phosphorylated sequences. For instance, the PTB domain is an alternative phosphotyrosine-binding domain that is found on some signal transduction proteins (Kavanaugh and Williams, 1994), and the WW domain of the mitotic peptide prolyl-isomerase Pin1 has recently been shown to bind to phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-containing peptides (Yaffe et al., 1997; Lu et al., 1999). It has also been suggested that WD-40 repeats of F box proteins could be phosphopeptide-binding motifs that target phosphorylated protein substrates to SCF complexes for their ubiquitination (Feldman et al., 1997; Skowyra et al., 1997). Although it is possible that some FHA domains interact with nonphosphorylated targets, our results suggest that the great majority will bind specifically to phosphorylated sequences, a characteristic that is currently only shared with the SH2 domain. In light of this similarity, it is tempting to speculate that, as has been established for the SH2 domain, the main function of the FHA domain is to localize proteins to subcellular compartments or protein complexes in a manner regulated by protein phosphorylation. Targeting of Rad53p to sites of DNA damage through the regulated phosphorylation of Rad9p is certainly in line with this idea. Furthermore, localization of the Rad50­Mre11 complex to sites of DNA damage in human cells has been shown to require Nibrin/ NBS1, an associated protein that contains an FHA domain and that is the product of the gene mutated in the developmental abnormality and cancer-prone condition, Nijmegen breakage syndrome (for review, see Featherstone and Jackson, 1998). Moreover, this targeted localization of NBS1­Rad50­Mre11 requires the Mec1p/Tel1p homolog, ATM (Maser et al., 1997). An attractive model, therefore, is that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of a DNA-bound target triggers FHAdependent localization of this complex to sites of DNA damage. It is also possible that the FHA domain is employed to target certain phosphorylated substrates to a catalytic activity. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the Dictyostelium discoideum Pin1 homolog, PinA (accession number U78757), contains an FHA domain, suggesting that the regulation of mitotic phosphoproteins

FHA Domains Bind Specific Phosphopeptide Sequences 393

by proline isomerization might be mediated by an FHA domain in the slime mold. Although lateral gene transfer cannot be ruled out, the existence of FHA domains in prokaryotes, yeasts, and humans suggests that this domain appeared early in evolution. The genome of the pathogenic bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes five putative FHAcontaining proteins, and our analysis of one of these, CY1A11.16C, reveals it to be capable of phosphodependent peptide binding. In line with the prediction that bacterial FHA-containing proteins function in phospho-dependent signaling pathways, at least some of the FHA-containing mycobacterial proteins appear to be linked with signal transduction. For example, mycobacterial MtuEmbR is part of the AfsR family of transcriptional regulators that function in two-component-like phosphorylation systems in Streptomyces (Matsumoto et al., 1994). Analyses of prokaryotic FHA-containing proteins may therefore further our understanding of how modular phosphopeptide recognition has evolved in the course of evolution. Finally, it will be of great interest to determine whether phosphopeptides or phosphopeptide analogs can be generated that are able to modulate inducible phosphopeptide­FHA domain interactions in a specific manner in vivo. Such developments would greatly facilitate the dissection of FHA-dependent signaling pathways and might serve as the basis for generating novel classes of therapeutic agent.

Diffley, ICRF Clare Hall, and U960-5C (MATa rad53 ::HIS3 sml1­1, in a W303 background) from R. Rothstein, Columbia University, were grown in nonselective or selective media. All genotoxic drugs were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). For preparation of yeast extracts, cultures were grown to an OD600 of 2.0, and the genotoxic agent (usually 0.02% MMS or 2 g/ml of 4-NQO) was added for a period of 60 min. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins GST­FHA1 (Rad53p residues 2­279), ­FHA2 (Rad53p residues 523­ 821), ­Yhr115cp (residues 2­386), ­KIAA0170 (residues 2­220), and ­CY116.16C (residues 1­160) were generated by PCR using primers with EcoRI restriction sites at the 5 ends followed by cloning inframe in the EcoRI site of pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The R70A, H88A, E117A, and the R605A mutations were made using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were verified by sequencing. GST­ KAPP was obtained from J. Walker. Fusion proteins were purified according to the GST manual (Amersham Pharmacia). Fusion proteins were dialyzed overnight in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), NaCl 50 mM, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 500 M 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulphoylfluoride (AEBSF) and then aliquoted and stored at 80 C. Protein concentration was determined by total amino acid analysis (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility, University of Cambridge). Peptides and Peptide Binding Studies Peptides were synthesized using FMOC chemistry. Quality-controlled peptides corresponding to ST, ST(P), and S(P)T were purchased from the ICRF peptide synthesis facility. All the other peptides were purchased from Chiron Technologies (Clayton, Australia) except for the peptide libraries, which were synthesized at the University of Bristol. To qualitatively assay FHA-peptide interactions, 50 ng fusion protein was incubated with 5 ng of biotinylated peptide in 100 l of binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl,

0.3% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), 1 mM DTT, 500 M AEBSF, and 2 M microcystin-LR) plus 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. Streptavidin magnetic beads (5 l; Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were added, and the reaction was incubated for a further 15 min. Peptide­protein complexes were removed using a magnet and washed four times in 500 l of binding buffer without BSA. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE, and GST fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). Yeast Protein Extraction and Association of Rad9p with GST­FHA Proteins Rad53p and Rad9p immunoblotting was performed as described previously (Vialard et al., 1998). Native yeast extracts (1 mg) were incubated with 500 ng of GST fusion proteins bound to glutathioneagarose in 500 l of 1 binding buffer plus complete protease inhibitor mix for 4 hr at 4 C on a rotating wheel. Beads were then washed four times in 1 binding buffer, and the protein complexes were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to SDSPAGE. For phosphatase protection, 150 ng of ST(P) peptide was incubated with 500 ng of GST fusion protein in 100 l of 1 phosphatase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.01% Brij 35 [pH 7.5]) for 1 hr on ice. protein phosphatase (1200 U; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and 2 mM final MnCl2 were then added, and reactions were stopped after 30 or 60 min by addition of 50 l of 0.5 EDTA. The entire reaction was spotted on nitrocellulose using a dot blot apparatus followed by probing with a phosphospecific antibody recognizing the phosphothreonine-18 of p53 (B. Hann, N. Lakin, and S. P. J., unpublished data). The data were quantified using the NIH image software. Biophysical Techniques Calorimetric measurements were carried out using a VP Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (VP-ITC; MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Data were analyzed using Origin, a software package provided by MicroCal. Enthalpies of injection were obtained using titration injection experiments. ST(P) peptide was titrated into GST­FHA1 fusion protein solution in the 1.37 ml reaction cell. Injections of 10 l peptide solution (419 M) from a 250 l syringe into the GST­FHA1 protein solution (24 M) were carried out with 10 s injection duration and 400 s spacing between injections. Total observed heats of reaction were corrected for the heats of dilution and mixing by subtracting the appropriate reference data peaks prior to data analysis. Data analysis is described in detail by Wiseman et al. (1989). For surface plasmon resonance, biotinylated peptides were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated chip (SA5) using a BIAcore 2000 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Biotinylated peptide (0.1 M) was manually injected at 10 l/min to an equivalent of 400 resonance units (RU). Protein was dialyzed and diluted in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.3% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF to concentrations ranging from 1 nM­20 M. GST­FHA fusions (80 l) at various concentrations were injected at a flow rate of 10 l/min. To regenerate the surface after each sample, 10 l of 0.5% SDS in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.3% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF were injected. This proved sufficient to dissociate completely the FHA1­peptide complex without affecting the streptavidin­peptide complex. The temperature was maintained at 4 C for the duration of the experiment. To determine the KD of GST­FHA domains binding to phosphorylated peptide, the change in RU upon binding was plotted versus protein concentration. The data were fitted to the Equation 1: RU (RUmax [FHA])/(KD [FHA]). Acknowledgments We thank all the members of the S. P. J. laboratory, especially J. Rouse, N. Lakin, A. McAinsh, B.
