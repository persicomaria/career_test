Abstract Methylenetetratetrahydromethanopterin reductase (Mer) is involved in CO2 reduction to methane in methanogenic archaea and catalyses the reversible reduction of methylenetetrahydromethanopterin (methylene-H4MPT) to methyl-H4MPT with coenzyme F420H2, which is a reduced 50 -deazaflavin. Mer was recently established as a TIM barrel structure containing a nonprolyl cis-peptide bond but the binding site of the substrates remained elusive. We report here on the crystal structure of Mer in complex ° with F420 at 2.6 A resolution. The isoalloxazine ring is present in a pronounced butterfly conformation, being induced from the Re-face of F420 by a bulge that contains the non-prolyl cis-peptide bond. The binding mode of F420 is very similar to that in F420-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase Adf despite the low sequence identity of 21%. Moreover, binding of F420 to the apoenzyme was only associated with minor conformational changes of the polypeptide chain. These findings allowed us to build an improved model of FMN into its binding site in bacterial luciferase, which belongs to the same structural family as Mer and Adf and also contains a nonprolyl cis-peptide bond in an equivalent position. Keywords: Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase; bacterial luciferase; crystal structure; nonprolyl cis-peptide bond coenzyme F420; FMN Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase (Mer) catalyzes the reversible reduction of N5,N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin (methylene-H4MPT) to N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin (methyl-H4MPT) with the concomitant oxidation of F420H2 to oxidized F420 (Fig. 1). F420 is a 50 deazaflavin derivative and H4MPT, a tetrahydrofolate analog. Mer is found in methanogenic and sulfate reducing archaea (Ma and Thauer 1990a,b; te Brommelstroet et al. 1990; Ma et al. 1991; Vaupel and Thauer 1995; Shima et al. 2002). In the methanogens Mer is involved in CO2 reduction to CH4, in methyl group oxidation to CO2, and in autotrophic CO2 fixation (Shima et al. 2000). In the sulphate-reducers the enzyme participates in acetate oxidation to CO2 with sulphate and

F420 binding site structure

Figure 1. (A) F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase (Mer) catalyzes the reversible reduction of N5,N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin (Methylene-H4MPT) to N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin (Methyl-H4MPT) with the concomitant oxidation of F420H2 to F420. The enzyme is Si-face specific with respect to the C5atom of F420. (B) F420 is a deazaflavin derivative and tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) a tetrahydrofolate analog. (R0 ) in H4MPT consists of an aminophenyl, a 1-deoxyribose, a ribose, a phosphate and a 2-hydroxyglutarate group. This figure was produced with ChemWindow (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

diverse substrates (Aufhammer et al. 2004). Mer, FMNdependent bacterial luciferase (LuxAB) (Baldwin et al. 1979), FMN-dependent alkanesulfonate monoxygenase (SsuD) (van Der Ploeg et al. 1999), F420-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (Adf) (Aufhammer et al. 2004), F420dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Mycobacteria (Purwantini and Daniels 1998), F420dependent oxidoreductase from Streptomyces (Peschke et al. 1995), and F420-dependent hydride transferase 1 from Rhodococcus (Heiss et al. 2002) are known so far as members of this family. Crystal structures of LuxAB (Fisher et al. 1995, 1996), Mer (Shima et al. 2000), SsuD (Eichhorn et al. 2002), and Adf (Aufhammer et al. 2004) have already been solved. The four enzymes with low sequence identity (<30%) show a similar (ab)8 barrel fold (TIM barrel fold) (Aufhammer et al. 2004). The unusual cis-peptide bond found in Mer (Shima et al. 2000) is also present in LuxAB (Fisher et al. 1996) and Adf (Aufhammer et al. 2004) but is absent in SsuD (Eichhorn et al. 2002). Of the bacterial luciferase enzyme family only the crystal structure of Adf in complex with its coenzyme has been determined (Aufhammer et al. 2004). The nonprolyl cispeptide bond was identified as an essential part of a bulge that serves as backstop to the Re-face of the F420isoalloxazine ring. Here, we present the structure of Mer from a mesophilic methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri (bMer), in complex with F420. Unfortunately all attempts to obtain a crystal structure with methylene-H4MPT have failed. The substrate was therefore modeled into the Mer structure assuming the conformation of methylene-H4MPT to be the same as in the crystal structure of the formaldehyde activating enzyme (Fae) (Acharya et al. 2005).

in autotrophic CO2 fixation (Schmitz et al. 1991; Vorholt et al. 1995, 1997). The cytoplasmic enzyme is composed of only one type of subunit with an apparent molecular mass between 35 kDa and 40 kDa. It lacks a prosthetic group and exhibits a ternary complex mechanism. Mer is not phylogenetically related to methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MetF), although both enzymes catalyze analogous reactions (Guenther et al. 1999). The crystal structures of Mer from two thermophilic methanogens, Methanopyrus kandleri (kMer) and Methanothermobacter marburgensis (tMer), in the absence of their substrates, have been reported (Shima et al. 2000). The subunits have a TIM barrel structure and exhibit an unusual nonprolyl cis-peptide bond where the active site is presumed. Attempts to obtain the crystal structures of tMer and kMer in complex with substrates have failed so far. Neither the cocrystallization of the enzyme with F420 under various screening conditions nor soaking of the crystals with the substrates yielded crystals of the complex. Mer belongs to the bacterial luciferase family that involves FMN- and F420-dependent oxidoreductases using

Results Crystal structure ° The crystal structure of bMer was solved at 2.6 A resolution by the molecular replacement method. The model was refined to Rcryst- and Rfree-factors of 18.5% and ° 22.1%, respectively, in the resolution range 2.6­50 A. bMer is present as a homotetramer in agreement with gel filtration results (Ma and Thauer 1990a). The arrangement of the subunits corresponds to that of kMer (Shima et al. 2000). The subunit of bMer consists of an (ab)8barrel core and three insertion regions named IR1 (Pro94-Pro111), IR2 (Gly127-Pro152), and IR3 (Lys216Pro285) (Figs. 2, 3). IR1 and IR3 consist mainly of helix a4-1 and the helical subdomains a7-1­a7-5, respectively, and constitute the walls of the F420and methylene-H4MPT binding cleft. Again, the electron density clearly indicates a well-ordered nonprolyl cis-peptide bond between Gly61 and Val62 that is located in a bulge at the end of strand

Insertion regions (IR) are indicated in green (IR1 and IR3) and in blue (IR2). IR1 and IR3 consist mainly of helix a4-1 and the helical subdomains a7-1­a7-5, respectively. IR2 is composed of a b-hairpin like segment between a4 and b5. These insertion regions have important functions in either binding of F420 (illustrated in red) and methylene-H4MPT (not shown) or in forming the interface between the subunits. This stereoplot was prepared with PYMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC).

b3. A superposition of the Mer subunits resulted in a root° mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.1 A (bMer to ° (bMer to kMer) for all Capositions tMer) and of 1.3 A indicating their strong structural relationship. The difference between the (ab)8barrel cores is significantly smaller ° (RMSD 0.6 A) than between the insertion regions. Structural differences of IR1 can be partly accounted for by the fact that bMer is present in complex with F420 and tMer and kMer without the coenzyme (see below). The structural analysis of bMer revealed two features in the electron density that are not interpretable as protein residues, F420, or water. The first electron density is located close to residue His36 in the substrate binding cleft of one of the subunits in the asymmetric unit and could be assigned to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule (n = 5). The PEG molecule is primarily linked to the protein by a hydrogen bond between its oxygen atom and the His36-Neatom and by hydrophobic interaction to Phe231, which is reoriented upon PEG binding. Bound PEG molecules have also been reported in other protein structures (Becker et al. 1998; Shima et al. 2000; Pylypenko et al. 2003). The second electron density patch ° is 6 A long and is attached to the C5atom of F420 and protrudes perpendicularly to its Si-face (Fig. 4). The presence of a covalent F420-adduct at the Si-face of the isoalloxazine ring indicates that C5of F420 is in an sp3 hybridization state. A similar covalent adduct was observed in the structure of the Adf­F420 complex (Aufhammer et al. 2004) and in the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase from Drosophila spec. (Benach et al. 1999) in which the additional molecule was characterized as an acetone. The mother liquor of the bMer crystals contained isopropanol, which is easily autoxidized to acetone, but an acetone molecule would be too small to fill out the electron density. The adduct must therefore be derived from the polyethylene glycol, which is known to 1842

be contaminated by formaldehyde and to contain various polyethylene glycol degradation products. F420 binding mode F420 binds rigidly with an high occupancy (see electron density in Figs. 4 and 5) into a cleft built up of strands b2, b5, b6, b7, and IR1. The 50 deazaisoalloxazine ring is in a pronounced butterfly conformation, the bending angle being 27 (Fig. 4). The central pyridine ring is kept in its position outside the plane by the nonprolyl cis-peptide oxygen of Gly61 and by the side chain of Val62 pointing toward the Re-site and acting as a backstop (Fig. 5). Conformation of the 50 deazaisoalloxazine ring in bMer is maintained at the Si-face by fixing the pyrimidine and hydroxybenzyl rings via hydrogen bonds to Asp35 and His36 and via hydrogen bonds to Leu174, respectively. The rest consisting of a ribitole, phosphate, lactate and two glutamates is buried inside the protein up to the first glutamate and contributes significantly to coenzyme binding. The second partly solvent-exposed glutamate is anchored to the protein matrix by interaction with the peptide nitrogens of Lys161 and Ala112 located at the N-terminal end of helix a4 (Fig. 5). ° In comparison, Adf that deviates by an RMSD of 2.3 A from bMer using 302 of the 330 Caatoms for superposition (DALI) (Holm and Sander 1993) showed a highly related F420 binding mode (Fig. 6) (Aufhammer et al. 2004). In particular, binding of the 50 deazaisoalloxazine ring from the Re-face is very similar. Differences in amino acid residues are found at the Si-face of F420; as in bMer, sufficient space is required to allow the approach of methylene-H4MPT to the Si-site of C5, whereas in Adf only space for the small secondary alcohol is needed. Additionally, differences are observed around the hydroxybenzyl group, which in bMer is hydrogen-bonded to the

without F420 is not available. However, because of the close structural relationship of the three enzymes (see above) it is nevertheless possible to draw some conclusions. The structural comparison clearly reveals that the F420 binding site is preconstructed in the apoenzyme. The only significant main chain alteration involves IR1, which ° moves at most 2 A toward the coenzyme upon F420 binding. IR1 is conformationally variable in tMer and kMer ,while the four crystallographically unrelated bMer mole° cules (RMSD $0.8 A) revealed an identical conformation of IR1 reflecting the rigidity of IR1 upon F420 binding. The observed movement places residues like Trp107 and Pro110 of the loop following helix a4-1 in van der Waals distance to the substituent of F420. Interestingly, the side chain of Asp96 in IR1, which probably is involved in methylene-H4MPT binding, changes its conformation upon F420 binding. Asp96 is hydrogen-bonded to Ala98 and Thr99 before F420-binding, whereas after coenzyme binding it points toward the bulk solvent in front of F420. Remarkable is also that Asp96, Gln158, and Asn176 showed higher B factors upon F420 binding, which might correlate with a higher flexibility of these residues. The methylene-H4MPt binding site of Mer Methylene-H4MPT is not found in the crystal structure of bMer, although the crystals are grown in the presence of methylene-H4MPT and F420. We assume that the unknown bulky molecule at the C5position of F420 partly occupies the binding site of the pterin and imidazolidine rings and thus prevents the binding of methylene-H4MPT. However, analyses of the Mer structures provide us with a variety of information, which can be used to postulate how methylene-H4MPT binds (Figs. 2, 7). The structure of bMer revealed a cleft generated by the (ab)8 barrel core (b1 + b8), IR1 (helix a4-1) and IR3 (helix a7-1) (Fig. 2). This cleft offers itself as binding site for methylene-H4MPT. The participation of IR3 in methylene-H4MPT binding was previously proposed (Shima et al. 2000). The side of the cleft formed by IR3 is characterized by several solvent-exposed hydrophobic

peptide carbonyl-oxygen of Leu174, whereas in Adf it only weakly interacts with Ser173. The reason might be that in bMer the bent conformation of the 50 deazaflavin ring is predominately maintained by electrostatic interactions with the hydroxybenzyl ring and in Adf by steric restraints. Comparison of the structures of Mer with and without F420 bound Unfortunately only the structure of bMer with F420 bound can be compared with the structures of tMer and kMer without the coenzyme bound.

Figure 5. Stereo plot showing the interactions between the coenzyme F420 molecule and bMer was drawn using Bobscript (Esnouf 1997) and Raster 3D (Bacon and Anderson 1988). The isoalloxazine ring is hydrogen-bonded to Asp35, His36, and Leu174. The nonprolyl cis-peptide bond formed by Gly61 and Val62 holds the isoalloxazine ring at its Re-face. The ribitol group is hydrogen-bonded to Gly95 and the phosphate is in hydrogen-bond distance to Gln158 and Gly159. Trp107 provides hydrophobic interaction to the lactate part of F420. The first glutamate of the tail is bound to Met162 and Lys161 and the second glutamate to Asp112 by hydrogen bonds.

side chains (e.g., Val227 and Phe231 shown in Fig. 7). These rather hydrophobic residues are involved in binding a PEG molecule, approximately outlining the binding site for the substituent of methylene-H4MPT. The position of F420 serves as fixed point to position the head group of methylene-H4MPT as its C14aatom ° has to be within a distance of 3.0­3.5 A of the C5atom of F420 for optimal hydride transfer. For sterical reasons the bulky head group has to be placed at the Si-face of F420. A hydride transfer at the Si-face is also in agreement with previous studies (Kunow et al. 1993). As mentioned above, Asp96, Gln158, and Asn176 showed an increased B-factor upon F420 binding, and might be fixed via a hydrogen bond to a bound methylene-H4MPT (Fig. 7). This is substantiated by the finding that Glu6, Asp96, and Gln158 of bMer are similarly arranged as the corresponding residues Glu25, Asp120, and Gln183 of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MetF). The latter residues in MetF were shown to be involved in methylenetetrahydrofolate binding by

site-specific mutagenesis experiments (Trimmer et al. 2001). A similar function of these residues in both enzymes is predicted. Based on all these factors, a model of methyleneH4MPT was built (Fig. 7) by taking the conformation of methylene-H4MPT bound in the formaldehydeactivating enzyme (Fae). Fae is the only H4MPT-specific enzyme whose structure with methylene-H4MPT bound has been solved (Acharya et al. 2005). Interestingly, in this conformation the benzyl, ribitol, and ribose moieties of methylene-H4MPT approximately superimposes with the PEG found in the structure (Fig. 7). This coincidence supports the reliability of the model. Discussion The structure of bMer in complex with F420 reported here is the second enzyme in the bacterial luciferase family where the 50 deazaflavin derivative could be seen in the electron density. Despite the low sequence identity

between Mer and Adf (21%) and a few modifications of the F420-binding site, the position and conformation of F420 is remarkably conserved. Moreover, F420 binding induced only minor conformational changes of the polypeptide such that the F420 binding site can be considered to be preconstructed prior to F420 binding. Both findings prompted us to model the FMN molecule into the structure of bacterial luciferase subunit LuxA (Fig. 7). Modeling of FMN into LuxA Despite an insignificant sequence identity between LuxA from Vibrio harveyi (Fisher et al. 1995) and bMer (16%), both enzymes are structurally related as indicated by an ° RMSD of 2.7 A when using 292 of the 340 Caatoms for superposition by DALI (Holm and Sander 1993) (Fig. 8A). Two crystal structures of LuxA are available: ° ° 1BRL at 2.5 A resolution and 1LUC at 1.5 A resolution. ° structure is Although the general accuracy of the 1.5 A improved, allowing the detection of the nonprolyl cis° peptide bond, we used the 2.5 A structure for constructing a model since the presence of phosphate bound to the enzyme better reflects the protein conformation after FMN binding. Accordingly, modeling of FMN into LuxA is straightforward by transferring F420 from bMer into the superimposed LuxA and by changing it to FMN (Fig. 8B). Except for Leu109, the distances between FMN ° and the protein atoms are longer than 2 A, indicating only minor interference. After modeling a cis-peptide bond between Ala74 and Ala75 and the side chain ° of Leu109 according to the 1.5 A structure of luciferase His44 was rotated into the position found in bMer. Finally, for adjusting the optimal van der Waals distances between the polypeptide chain and FMN the model was subjected to a short energy minimization procedure using CNS (Brunger et al. 1998; Hagemeier et al. 2003)

that did not, however, alter the global results of the experimentally based ``flavin transfer modelling'' from bMer to luciferase. As visualized in Figure 8C, the essential flavin­protein interactions conserved between bMer and Adf are maintained in luciferase. However, the surrounding of the dimethylbenzyl group is significantly changed compared to that of the hydroxybenzyl group of Mer. Val173 and Ile191 provide hydrophobic contacts with the methyl groups at C7 and C8 of FMN and might also play a role in maintaining the butterfly conformation (Fig. 8B). The crucial role of Val173 is confirmed by mutations at Val173 that affected the color of bioluminescence emission and/or the reaction kinetics of luciferase catalysis (Lin et al. 2004). Other mutational studies (Baldwin et al. 1995) comprising the residues Asp113, Ser227, Trp194, and Trp250 contacting the isoalloxazine ring are completely compatible with our model (these residues are not shown in Fig. 8 for clarity). Interestingly, the phosphate molecule found in ° ° LuxA is only 1.2 A and 0.8 A apart from the independently modeled phosphate groups of F420 in bMer and Adf, respectively. Mutation of Arg107, which is hydrogen bonded to the phosphate group in our FMN model (Fig. 8B,C), to neutral or negatively charged amino acids led to an increased Km value for reduced FMN (Moore et al. 1999; Lin et al. 2001) thereby supporting the correct positioning of the phosphate group. The new FMN model and its implication for the LuxA reaction LuxA catalyzes the reaction of reduced FMN, molecular oxygen, and a long-chain aliphatic aldehyde to yield oxidized FMN, aliphatic carboxylic acid, and blue-green light (Baldwin et al. 1979).

established experimentally, but a model for FMN was proposed based on computer-assisted conformational search methods (Lin et al. 2001) with incorporation of the mutational data and the inorganic phosphate binding site (Xin et al. 1991; Abu-Soud et al. 1993; Moore et al. 1999; Lin et al. 2001). The FMN binding position derived by modelling based on the structure of the bMer-F420 complex is similar to that obtained via computations. However, the orientation of the isoalloxazine ring differs substantially. For example, the nonprolyl 1846

cis-peptide oxygen approximately points toward atom N5 of FMN, whereas this oxygen serves as a backstop for the ring in our model. Furthermore, the conformation of the reduced isoalloxazine ring in LuxA was considered to be planar based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (Vervoort et al. 1986). We favor, in contrast, a bent conformation of the flavin ring in LuxA, as observed in bMer and Adf (Figs. 5, 6). A bent conformation of FMN would be compatible with the conformation of FMN and FAD found in

F420 binding site structure

other enzymes (Ahn et al. 2004; Edmondson et al. 2004) and with energy calculations of flavins (Hall et al. 1987). The new model of FMN also provides us with new information about the function of crucial residues that might contribute to a better understanding of the luciferase reaction. The most striking observation is the pronounced butterfly conformation of the isoalloxazine ring that increases the space in front of atom C4a. The bending of flavin ring raises C4aout of the plane and forces it to rehybridize. With binding the hydroperoxy or hydroxy group in its intermediate states, a sp3 hybridization is reached. Whether the bent conformation and its potential alteration can be correlated with the bioluminescence property of luciferase is, of course, an open question. The importance of the nonprolyl cis-peptide bond for isoalloxazine binding was recognized previously (Lin et al. 2001), but its specific function to maintain a bent conformation is only now evident. Accordingly, the dramatic effect of the Cys106Val mutant might be due to a collision between the side chains of Val106 and cis-peptide forming Ala75, thereby destroying the butterfly conformation of FMN. In the bMer derived model, the thiol group of Cys106 has a ° distance of 3.2 A to the N1atom of F420 and is not directly involved in the bioluminescence reaction in agreement with previous results (Abu-Soud et al. 1993). Nevertheless, Cys106 of Vibrio harveyi luciferase could stabilize the deprotonated N1atom, increasing the nucleophilicity of atoms N5 and C4a and stabilizing the C4a-hydroperoxy and hydroxy-intermediate states of the flavin (Xi et al. 1990; Abu-Soud et al. 1993). From the structural point of view the most interesting residue is His44, which was rotated toward the Si-site of the isoalloxazine ring in accordance with the conformation found in bMer and Adf. In this position the imidazole ring would be directly in contact with the postulated covalent flavin adducts and might act as a catalytic acid or a catalytic base. These results are in agreement with mutagenesis experiments that already showed the important role of His44 for bioluminescence activity and on aldehyde consumption (Xin et al. 1991). The function of His44 as a catalytic base was also previously proposed (Huang and Tu 1997). Materials and methods Materials

M. barkeri was grown in a medium containing 1% methanol at 37 C and cells were harvested in the exponential phase (Karrasch et al. 1989). Cell extracts were prepared in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.6). All purification steps were performed in an anaerobic chamber (Coy) due to the inactivation of the enzyme under aerobic conditions. bMer was purified using Blue Sepharose CL-6B and Resource Q chromatography columns as previously described (Ma and Thauer 1990a). Additionally, a Ceramic Hydroxyapatit column (BioRad) (14 mL) was applied, which was equilibrated with 30 mL 0.03 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). bMer was eluted using a linear gradient of a sodium phosphate buffer (0.03­0.5 M, 200 mL). The enzyme was recovered in the fractions at 0.5 M sodium phosphate. About 4 mg pure enzyme, with a specific activity of 250 U/mg at 55 C under standard assay conditions (Ma and Thauer 1990a) could be isolated from 10 l culture. The purified enzyme was desalted and concentrated in a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon) and adjusted to a concentration of 13 mg/mL in MOPS/KOH (pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.1 M NaCl for subsequent crystallization. Precipitations that occurred during the enzyme concentration were removed by filtration (pore size 0.45 mm).

Crystallization and data collection
Lyophilised F420 and H4MPT were dissolved in 120 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) under anaerobic conditions. Methylene-H4MPT was synthesized from the spontaneous reaction of formaldehyde with H4MPT (Ma and Thauer 1990a). Shortly before crystallization, the enzyme was mixed with these substrates. The protein concentration was 9 mg/mL; the concentrations of F420 and of methylene-H4MPT were 1.5 mM. The search for crystallization conditions was carried out in an anaerobic chamber at a temperature of 8 C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals grew best in a drop consisting of 1 mL enzyme solution containing the substrates and 1 mL of reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M Tris/ HCl (pH 8.5), 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, and 10% isopropanol. As freezing buffer, the reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol was applied. Crystals were mounted on a fiber loop and flash frozen in a gaseous nitrogen stream (100 K). The space group was P21 and the lattice parameters ° ° ° were a = 81.8 A, b = 83.4 A, c = 99.2 A, and b = 91.2 best compatible with one tetramer in the asymmetric unit (Matthews 1968). X-ray data sets were collected at the European Synchroton Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France, at the ID29 beamline using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. The data collection statistics for the data set (Kabsch 1988) are summarized in Table 1.

Phase determination, model building, and refinement
Phases of bMer crystals were determined by the method of molecular replacement with the programs AmoRe (Navaza 1994) and EPMR (Kissinger et al. 1999), using the coordinates of a tMer dimer (1F07) as model. For refinement the sequence of bMer was built into the structure of tMer using the SwissProt

server (Schwede et al. 2003). Coordinates were refined with the crystallography and NMR system program (CNS) (Brunger et al. 1998) using standard protocols. Manual corrections of the model were performed by examination of the (2Fo À Fc ) and (Fo À Fc ) maps with the program O (Jones et al. 1991). A total of 239 solvent molecules were added using the water pick protocol implemented in CNS. The quality of the model was checked within PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. 1993). The Ramachandran plot showed all of the nonglycine or nonproline residues in the most favored (91.1%) or additionally allowed regions (8.5%) except for one.
