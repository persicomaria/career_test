ABSTRACT:

The transacting transcriptional activator (Tat) is a viral protein essential for activation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genes, and it plays an important role in HIV induced immunodeficiency. We report the NMR structural characterization of the active Tat Mal variant that belongs to a highly virulent Dsubtype HIV type-1 (HIV-1) strain (Mal) found mainly in Africa. A full Tat Mal protein (87 residues) is synthesized. This synthetic protein is active in a transactivation assay with HeLa cells infected with the HIV long terminal repeated noncoding sequences of the HIV-1 provirus (LTR) lac Z gene. Homonuclear 1H-NMR spectra allows the sequential assignment of the Tat Mal spin systems. Simulating annealing generates 20 conformers with similar folding. The geometry of the mean structure is optimized with energy minimization to obtain a final structure. As the European variant (Tat Bru) the N-terminal region of Tat Mal constitutes the core, and there is a hydrophobic pocket composed of the conserved Trp 11 interacting with several aromatic residues. The two functional regions of Tat (basic and the cysteine-rich regions) are well exposed to the solvent. A short -helix is observed in region V adjacent to the basic region. This helix induces local structural variations compared to the NMR structure of Tat Bru, and it brings the cysteine-rich and basic regions closer. This study suggests that similar folding exists among Tat variants. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Biopolymers (Biospectroscopy) 62: 324 ­335, 2001

varies from 86 to 106 residues, depending on the human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1) isolate.1­3 Tat contains six different regions, each having specific biochemical and functional characteristics.4 Region I (residues 1­21) is a prolinerich region and has a conserved Trp 11. Region II (residues 22­37) has seven conserved cysteines at positions 22, 25, 27, 30, 31, 34, and 37. No other

cysteines are found in the sequence and there is no evidence that disulfide bridges are required for Tat function.5 Region III (residues 38 ­ 48) has a conserved Phe 38 and the conserved sequence LGISYG from residues 43 to 48. Region IV (residues 49 ­59) is rich in basic residues and has the conserved sequence RKKRRQRRRPP. Region V (residues 60 ­72) is a glutamine-rich region. Region VI constitutes the C-terminus of Tat encoded by the second exon, but its size depends on the HIV isolate. The C-terminus shows similarities with the N-terminus with a high percentage of prolines. Tat is expressed very early in the HIV cycle, and it binds to an RNA "hairpin" called RNA transactivation response element (TAR), which is located at the 5 end of all HIV mRNAs.6 The Tat basic region adopts an extended structure to fit into the TAR major groove.7 The Tat­TAR interaction stimulates the production of full-length viral transcripts by RNA polymerase II to allow production of viral protein.8 This mechanism, called transactivation, also requires the cysteinerich region of Tat to interact with a complex of cellular proteins that includes cyclin T.1 Acetylation and deacetylation of Tat seems to be important for HIV transcription. Two sites of acetylation of Tat were determined on the cysteine-rich and the basic regions.9,10 Tat has other intracellular roles for HIV, such as inhibiting a protein kinase called PKR, that is involved in cellular death, which would be detrimental for the HIV cycle. Interestingly, PKR can phosphorylate and inhibit Tat.11 However, highly virulent HIV strains found in Africa have Tat proteins with mutations in region V that prevent inactivation by PKR.5 HIV infected cells release Tat, and Tat antibodies are detected in the sera of seropositive patients.12 Kaposi sarcoma lesions are due to the direct interaction of Tat with a basic fibroblast growth factor ( -FGF).13 Recently, extracellular Tat was also reported to bind to the CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), which is the HIV-1 coreceptor with CD4.14 The most important role of extracellular Tat is its immunosuppressive effect on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and macrophages.1,2,15 This mechanism of evading the host immune response helps to maintain HIV reservoir cells and contributes to the inefficiency of actual antiviral therapies to eradicate HIV.2 The requirement of Tat for HIV replication and the important role played by extra cellular Tat in HIV induced immunodeficiency makes it an important target for curing the HIV infection. A

therapy that would be able to neutralize Tat is a major issue in the curing of AIDS.1,2 Three-dimensional (3-D) structures of fully active Tat variants are necessary to develop a rational drug design strategy against this protein. The first NMR structural study was carried out on the Tat Z2 variant that is 86 residues long.16 The inactivation of Tat Z2 with reducing agents apparently caused structural instability, because only 25 long distance NMR constraints were reported, which were mainly located in regions III and V.16 Another NMR study was carried out with the Tat Bru variant,17 which is an 86 residue variant that belongs to the B-subtype HIV-1 strain that is still found in Europe and North America. The NMR study on Tat Bru showed that this active protein had a definite structure and yields to 273 long distance constraints.17 Tat Mal came from a highly virulent HIV-1 isolate recovered from a 24-year-old woman during a dramatic increase of AIDS in central Africa in the 1980s.18 We report the complete NMR assignment and a structural characterization of Tat Mal, an 87 residue variant representative of D-subtype HIV-1 strains. The D subtype is extremely important because it is a highly virulent subtype found mainly in Africa. Using homonuclear 1H-NMR spectra, we identify 1347 NMR constraints, including 290 long range constraints, and provide the structural information needed to determine the folding of the active form of Tat Mal. Although there are local variations, the folding of Tat Mal and Tat Bru are similar and the different domains are organized around region I. For instance, Tat Mal has a short helix on region V that is not found in Tat Bru. These local variations were expected because of earlier molecular modeling and circular dichroism (CD) studies carried out on different Tat variants, including Tat Mal and Tat Bru.5,19 This 1 H-NMR study shows the structural variations between one African variant and one European variant of Tat proteins.

The HPLC was also used for analysis as previously described.5 Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out on a single quad PE-SCIEX API 150ex (Perkin­Elmer). Amino acid analyses were performed on a Beckman model 6300 analyzer. NMR Spectroscopy Five milligrams of Tat Mal and Tat Z2 were lyophilized and dissolved in 500 L of H2O/D2O (9 : 1) 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 4.5. Azide

2/1000 was added to each sample of Tat Mal to prevent bacterial degradation. The homonuclear 1-D and 2-D 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-500 at 20°C. The water signal was suppressed by selective presaturation in total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments21 and by field gradients in 2-D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments.22 The TOCSY spectrum was obtained with a mixing time of 80 ms. The NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 100, 150, and 200 ms and a spectral width of 6009.62 Hz. The window functions used in data processing were sinebell square. Data were processed with Felix 98.0 from MSI Technologies, Inc. (San Diego, CA), running on a Silicon Graphics O2 Workstation.

NMR Refinement The molecular modeling of Tat Mal based on NMR constraints was carried out with the Insight II 97 package including Biopolymer, Discover, Homology, and NMR-refine software from Felix 97 (MSI Technologies) running on the Silicon Graphics O2. The consistent valence force field was used to simulate the system energies. High temperature simulated annealing was carried out using the NMR-refine DGII procedure of Nilges et al.23

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The chemical synthesis of Tat Mal was done in a single run using fast Fmoc chemistry. After purification the HPLC analysis revealed that Tat Mal had a retention time similar to Tat Bru.5 Tat Mal is composed of 87 residues and has a molecular mass of 10040 (data not shown). The transactivation assay of Tat Mal showed higher transactivation activity compared to Tat Bru.5 The low dispersion of Tat NMR spectra makes the structural study of these HIV proteins difficult. Moreover, Tat variants contain many prolines and many repetitive sequences that complicate the sequential assignment.24 We had to label specific residues with 13C to complete the sequential assignment for the NMR study of Tat Bru.17 There is 78% sequence homology between Tat Mal and Tat Bru, and half of the mutations are semiconservative (Table I). The sequence homology between these two proteins and the experience gained in the Tat Bru NMR study were very helpful in elucidating the Tat Mal NMR structure.17 The following spin systems were identified from the Tat Mal TOCSY spectrum: 25/25 AMX (Asp, Cys, His, Phe, Ser, Tyr, and Trp); 11/12 Gln, Glu, and Met; 7/7 Gly; 1/1 Ala; 12/15 Arg and Lys; 3/3 Thr; and 6/6 Val, Leu, and Ile. The sequential assignment for these spin systems was obtained using the space connectivities H i NHi 1, lateral chain NHi 1 as H i NHi 1 and lateral chain H i 1 (Fig. 1). Three spin systems corresponding to Trp 11, Ile 45, and Ala 64 were used as starting amino acids and allowed the complete sequential assignment. The chemical shifts of the protons of Tat Mal are listed in Table I. The aromatic spin systems were identified from the 1H-NOESY spectra using connectivities observed between the aromatic protons and the H and/or H protons (Fig. 2). It was not possible to identify the NH of Arg 19 and Met 36 (Table I).

Although the H of prolines have a low dispersion in the 1H-NOESY spectrum, 10/13 Pro were identified with 1H-NOESY spectra because of sequential H NHi 1 and H i 1 NOE connectivities (Fig. 3). The sequential NHi 1 or H i 1 NOE connectivities with the H of proline indicate that the majority of the proline was in a trans conformation. Three prolines were found in the cis conformation as revealed by the H NHi 1 and H i 1 NOE connectivities (Fig. 3). From the proton assignment, we identified 1347 NMR distance constraints. This is more than the 915 distance constraints identified with Tat Bru.17 Figure 4 shows a histogram of the distance constraints as a function of the residue number. The two main categories correspond to intraresidues (528) and interresidues (819). The interresidues were subdivided into 381 sequential (i, i 1), 148 medium [(i j) 5], and 290 long range [(i j) 4] categories. In both cases the cysteine-rich region and the basic region have the lowest number of distance constraints. This indicates that the lateral chains of these two regions are mainly solvent exposed and confirms the functional role of these two regions for Tat. The global fold of the protein was determined using a simulated annealing protocol.23 From 100 randomized coordinates, 20 conformers were selected with the lowest van der Waals energies, Coulombic energies, and respect of NMR constraints. Superimposition of these 20 conformers shows that they have similar folding (Fig. 5). The small conformational differences are observed mainly in the basic region and the cysteine region, which is in agreement with the lower number of NMR constraints observed for these two regions (Fig. 4). The mean structure was then refined by energy minimization without NMR constraints (Table II). Geometry optimization yielded a final structure with significantly decreased system energy in the range expected for a protein the size of Tat.19 However, the cross-peak overlaps observed in the Tat NOESY spectra make the precise evaluation of some distances difficult, although these peaks can be identified with no ambiguity. The cross peaks shown in Figure 2 illustrate this problem of NOEs overlaps. The NOEs in Figure 2 correspond mainly to intraresidual constraints in the aromatic rings. The distances, which were determined from these NOEs, were not compatible with the ring geometry. This problem observed with some intraresidual constraints was also observed with interresidual constraints. Consequently, in the final structure, 25% of the constraints are not re-

spected with an average violation upper limit of 0.15 nm. Nevertheless, the 1347 NMR constraints remain between 0.1 and 0.6 nm in this final structure, which has the lowest energy and the best idealized geometry compared to the 20 average structures (Table II). In a former CD study of Tat Mal in pH 4.5 phosphate buffer, it was determined that 10% of the residues were helix, 14% sheet (or extended structure), 33% turns, and 43% "other structures."5 As for Tat Bru, the main secondary structures observed in the NMR Tat Mal structure are turns. This is in agreement with the CD study indicating that 33% of Tat Mal residues are turns.5 The presence of NN (i, i 1), NN(i, i 2), and N(i, i 3) but the lack of N(i, i 4) from Asp 5 to Pro 21 show that region I of Tat Mal is composed of turns structures. There is one N(i, i 4) between Met 1 and Val 4, suggesting that 1MDPV could have the characteristics of an -helix turn. In another CD study we showed that region I of Tat Bru is unable to form an helix, even in a solvent that favors -helix structures.19 This is certainly due to the six wellconserved prolines in this region, which are not compatible with the -helix structure. In region I two turns are observed involving residues

EPWN and 17QPRT. Except for the 1MDPV regions, the secondary structures of region I were similar in the two variants [Fig. 6(A)]. The cysteine-rich region (region II) has two turns involving 22CNKC and 29KCCY (Fig. 1), where two loops are observed in Tat Bru. In region III there is a loop starting from Phe 38 in Tat Mal where a turn is observed for Tat Bru. The 44GISY sequence is conserved in Tat variants [Fig. 6(C)] and is a turn in both Tat Mal and Tat Bru.17 The NN(i, i 1) between Ile 45 and Ser 46 is observed in both Tat Mal (Fig. 1) and Tat Bru.17 The basic region (region IV) adopts an extended structure similar to Tat Bru [Fig. 6(D)]. Region V in Tat Mal from Gln 60 to Gln 66 is characterized by the presence of several NN(i, i 1), NN(i, i 2), N(i, i 3), (i, i 3), and N(i, i 4) (Fig. 1). Three consecutive N(i, i 3) from Gly 61 to Gln 66 and three consecutive N(i, i 4) from Gln 60 to Gln 66 are observed. These consecutive connectivities suggest the presence of a helix structure in region V (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with the CD data of Tat Mal obtained at pH 4.5, revealing that 10% of the amino acids (nine residues) adopt an -helix conformation.5 No helix was observed at pH 4.5 by CD in Tat Bru and in other Tat variants except Tat Z2.5 Region V of Tat Mal constitutes a short helix of seven residues from Gln 60 to Gln 66 whereas two turns were identified in this region for Tat Bru

(Fig. 1). This helix is ended by a turn involving the 67DPLP sequence. The C-terminus (region VI) is characterized by the presence of a turn involving the 77HRGD sequence instead of a loop as found in Tat Bru.17 This turn is revealed by a NN(i, i 1) between Gly 79 and Asp 80 and a N(i, i 3) between His 77 and Asp 80. The absence of a sheet and a short helix explains why only 35% of the dihedral angles are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table II). In the Tat Bru and Tat Mal NOESY spectra, long distance NOEs cross peaks are found between region I and the other regions (II, III, IV, V, and VI). This is due to the central location of

region I (Fig. 7). The Tat Bru and Tat Mal core are constituted mainly of region I, and Trp 11 has a central position that is a part of a hydrophobic pocket containing Phe 38 and Tyr 47. In Tat Mal the core is constituted mainly of the 10 aromatic residues organized as a hydrophobic cluster. This result is important to identify new molecules that can bind and inactive Tat proteins. As observed with Tat Bru, the NOE long distance cross peaks put the -turn 9EPWN close to the -turn 44GISY. Gly 15 and Ser 16 are close to the helix formed by region V (Fig. 7). The NOE long distance cross peaks between region V and the C-terminal region (region VI) are also observed in Tat Bru. Nevertheless, Tat Mal has different locations for

CONCLUSION
Our NMR studies on active Tat proteins from European and African strains show that they share similar folding. This folding is characterized by a central location of the N-terminal region (Fig. 7). Tat Mal and Tat Bru also have a hydrophobic pocket in common that contains well-conserved aliphatic and aromatic residues (such as Trp 11). Alignment of 107 Tat sequences that belong to different HIV strains and with variable sizes ranging from 86 to 102 residues shows that the basic region is the most conserved domain of Tat (data not shown). Regions I, II, and III are less conserved than the basic region, although some residues remain strictly conserved such as the majority of cysteines and Trp 11. The less conserved regions are regions V and VI among the Tat variants. We previously showed that the two regions surrounding the basic region, regions III and V, have the most conformational heterogeneity and could be a hinge that allows the basic region to fit into the Tat nucleotide target TAR.19 The transactivation assay of Tat found in Africa showed a higher transactivation activity when compared to Tat variants from HIV-1 strains found in Europe and the United States, such as Tat Bru.5 A functional study suggested that the difference in activity between Tat Bru and Tat Mal could be due to mutations S/G 61, T/Q 63, and S/D 67 in the phosphorylation site of PKR.5 We show here that regions III and V are highly folded. Region V in Tat Bru, has two -turn structures.17 Region V in Tat Mal is formed by an helix and ends with a turn. Another study showed by CD that when Tat Bru (47­72) bound TAR, Tat adopts an -helix structure that is supposed to be located in region V.7 In Tat Mal this helix is already formed and brings the two functional regions of Tat (cysteine-rich and basic regions) closer compared with Tat Bru. Moreover, the C-terminal region is closer to region III in Tat Mal. These structural differences could participate in the higher activity of Tat Mal and could be a structural evolution of the African variants.5

region II and region VI compared to Tat Bru (Fig. 7). In Tat Mal and Tat Bru, region II, which constitutes the cysteine-rich region, is formed by two turns and is well exposed to solvent. However, the additional long range NOEs observed in Tat Mal, for example between Tyr 32 and Ala 64, show that region II is closer to region V compared with Tat Bru. In addition, region VI interacts with region I and with the -turn 44GISY of region III (Fig. 7). Also, long distance NOEs are found between His 13, Tyr 47, Asp 80, and His 81. These differences between Tat Mal and Tat Bru are due to structural variations observed at the beginning of region III and, more especially, to the presence of the helix in region V. These local structural variations observed in regions III and

(A) A ribbon representation of Tat Mal, (B) a ribbon representation of Tat Bru,17 and (C) superimposition of the Tat Mal and Tat Bru ribbons. The folding of Tat Mal and Tat Bru is similar but local variations are observed, mainly in region V. The basic and the cysteine-rich regions are well exposed to the solvent, and a part of the N-terminal region constitutes the core of Tat Mal and Tat Bru. Another similarity is that the basic region adopts an extended structure while two turns are located in the cysteine-rich region. The main difference between the two structures is the presence of a short helix in Tat Mal observed in region V, which is replaced by two turns in Tat Bru. Region II is closer to region IV and region III is closer to region VI in Tat Mal.
