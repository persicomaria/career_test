Summary Trypanothione replaces glutathione in defence against cellular damage caused by oxidants, xenobiotics and methylglyoxal in the trypanosomatid parasites, which cause trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. In Leishmania major, the first step in methylglyoxal detoxification is performed by a trypanothione-dependent glyoxalase I (GLO1) containing a nickel cofactor; all other characterized eukaryotic glyoxalases use zinc. In kinetic studies L. major and human enzymes were active with methylglyoxal derivatives of several thiols, but showed opposite substrate selectivities: N1-glutathionylspermidine hemithioacetal is 40-fold better with L. major GLO1, whereas glutathione hemithioacetal is 300-fold better with human GLO1. Similarly, S-4-bromobenzylglutathionylspermidine is a 24-fold more potent linear competitive inhibitor of L. major than human GLO1 (Kis of 0.54 mM and 12.6 mM, respectively), whereas S4-bromobenzylglutathione is > 4000-fold more active against human than L. major GLO1 (Kis of 0.13 mM and > 500 mM respectively). The crystal structure of L. major GLO1 reveals differences in active site architecture to both human GLO1 and the nickel-dependent Escherichia coli GLO1, including increased negative charge and hydrophobic character and truncation of a loop that may regulate catalysis in the human enzyme. These differences correlate with the differential binding of glutathione and trypanothione-based substrates, and thus offer a route to the rational design of L. major-specific GLO1 inhibitors.

Introduction Intracellular thiols protect organisms against chemical and oxidative stress, with the major low-molecular mass thiol in most eukaryotes being glutathione (-L-glutamyl-Lcysteinylglycine; GSH). However, in pathogenic trypanosomatids (Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma spp.), glutathione is replaced by trypanothione [N1,N8bis(glutathionyl)spermidine] (Fairlamb et al., 1985). In these protozoa, the major role of trypanothione and trypanothione-dependent enzymes is to protect against oxidative damage and the maintenance of a trypanothione pool is essential for their survival (Dumas et al., 1997; Krieger et al., 2000; Comini et al., 2004). However, another important function of thiols is to protect cells from toxic metabolic by-products such as methylglyoxal, a reactive 2-oxoaldehyde. Methylglyoxal is produced by the fragmentation of triose phosphates in either a spontaneous reaction or through a side-reaction of triosephosphate isomerase (Thornalley, 1996). Methylglyoxal is toxic and mutagenic as it reacts with both proteins and nucleic acids (Marinari et al., 1984; Lo et al., 1994) forming advanced glycation end-products which are implicated in ageing and chronic diseases including diabetes and renal failure (Thornalley et al., 2003). The glyoxalase (GLO) system is a ubiquitous thioldependent detoxification pathway that metabolizes methylglyoxal. This system comprises two enzymes that act sequentially to isomerize and then hydrolyse the hemithioacetal adduct that is formed spontaneously between glutathione and methylglyoxal, thereby converting methylglyoxal to D-lactate (Thornalley, 1996). In the first step of this pathway, GLO1 (lactoylglutathione lyase, EC 4.4.1.5 or GLO1) isomerizes this hemithioacetal to SD-lactoyl-glutathione, through proton transfer to a metalbound enediol intermediate (Davidson et al., 2001). S-Dlactoyl-glutathione is then the substrate of a second enzyme, GLO2 (hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase, EC 3.2.1.6 or GLO2) that hydrolyses this thioester, releasing glutathione and D-lactate. Thus, in the overall sequential reaction, glutathione acts as a cofactor and is not consumed. Recently, Trypanosoma brucei GLO2 was found to be significantly more active with lactoylthioesters of trypan-

1240 A. Ariza et al. othione than those of glutathione (Irsch and Krauth-Siegel, 2004) and a parallel study showed that Leishmania major GLO1 (LmGLO1) is specific for trypanothione hemithioacetals (Vickers et al., 2004). LmGLO1 is unique among the characterized eukaryotic GLO1 enzymes in not utilizing zinc but rather requiring divalent nickel as a cofactor [in common with GLO1 from bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Yersinia pestis (Sukdeo et al., 2004)] and it is more similar in sequence to this typically prokaryotic family than to other eukaryotic GLO1 proteins. Importantly, trypanothione-dependent enzymes are often sufficiently different from their human equivalents for these enzymes to be targets for structureaided drug design (Schmidt and Krauth-Siegel, 2002). Moreover, glutathione-based GLO1 inhibitors have antimalarial (Thornalley et al., 1994) and antitrypanosomal properties (DSilva and Daunes, 2000). In combination, these data define the trypanosomatid GLO system as a trypanothione-dependent metabolic pathway that is radically different from the equivalent human system. This pathway may thus represent a novel drug target in these important pathogens that is suitable for the design of selective and potent inhibitors. Crystal structures of human GLO1 [HsGLO1; PDB (Bernstein et al., 1977) entries 1FRO, 1QIN, 1QIP (Cameron et al., 1997; 1999)] and E. coli GLO1 [EcGLO1; 1F9Z, 1FA5-8 (He et al., 2000)] have revealed homodimeric molecules where each active site is composed of residues contributed by both subunits. These studies have defined the mode of binding of glutathionebased inhibitors (Cameron et al., 1997; 1999) and explained how the differential metal dependence of typical eukaryotic and prokaryotic GLO1 enzymes is based on the structural requirement of octahedral coordination to stabilize the transition state (He et al., 2000). In this article we describe the crystal structure and kinetics of LmGLO1 and contrast these with those of the E. coli and human enzymes. We show that the human and L. major enzymes have mutually exclusive substrate specificities and markedly different sensitivities to substrate-based inhibitors, and that these differences are due to the enzymes' contrasting structural features. Results and discussion Substrate specificity of L. major and human GLO1 The L. major and human enzymes were tested for activity with the methylglyoxal hemithioacetals of a set of glutathione derivatives (Table 1). For LmGLO1, the hemithioacetals of the glycyl amides of glutathione (glutathionylspermidine and trypanothione) were the best substrates with specificity constants (kcat/Km) greater than 107 M-1 s-1. The hemithioacetals of glycyl esters of glutathione were also reasonable substrates with the bulkier isopropyl ester hemithioacetal preferred to the ethyl ester. However, the glutathione hemithioacetal was a very poor substrate, with its specificity constant being 280-fold lower than the glutathionylspermidine hemithioacetal. The substrate specificity of HsGLO1 was broadly opposite to that of LmGLO1. Here, the glutathione amide hemithioacetals were poor substrates, with the glutathione hemithioacetal being the best substrate. However, substrate discrimination was less than that seen with LmGLO1, with the specificity constant of the glutathionylspermidine hemithioacetal only 50-fold less than the glutathione hemithioacetal. In the human enzyme, selectivity may result from an inability of glutathionylspermidine hemithioacetals to induce the conformation proposed to be required for catalytic activity (Cameron et al., 1999), because these substrates were able to bind with Km values only threefold higher than GSH, but turned over 16fold slower than the GSH hemithioacetal. Inhibition of L. major and human GLO1 The active sites of the L. major and human GLO1 enzymes were also probed with a set of glutathione- and glutathionylspermidine-based inhibitors (Table 2; com-

In contrast, S2,4-dinitrophenylglutathionylspermidine (3) and S-4-bromobenzylglutathionylspermidine (4) were effective linear competitive inhibitors with 4 being >1000-fold more potent than 3. In contrast, all four compounds are inhibitors of HsGLO1, which discriminates strongly between the glutathione derivatives, with 2 being >5000-fold more potent than 1. Compound 4 is 24-fold less potent than with LmGLO1. Global structure of L. major GLO1 In common with previously published GLO1 structures (Cameron et al., 1997; He et al., 2000), the LmGLO1 monomer is composed of two  domains. The dimer is formed by the interaction of the first domain of one monomer and the second domain of the other (Fig. 1) producing an eight-stranded -sheet, with pseudo-twofold symmetry. The catalytic metal ion (Fig. 2) lies 0.25 Å from the twofold axis, coordinated by histidines (8 and 77*) and glutamates (59 and 120*, where the asterisks indicate residues from a different subunit). LmGLO1 crystals contain three dimers (AB, CD and EF) in the asymmetric unit (Ariza et al., 2005), which are largely identical [root-meansquare (RMS) deviations between 0.10 and 0.41 Å]. As the dimer CD is best-defined in the electron density it was used for subsequent calculations and interpretation. The structure of LmGLO1 is more similar to that of the prokaryotic, Ni2+-dependent EcGLO1 (He et al., 2000), than the eukaryotic, Zn2+-dependent HsGLO1 (Cameron et al., 1999) (Fig. 1C and D). This supports earlier predictions based on sequence comparison and functional characterization (Vickers et al., 2004). Although RMS deviations are similar (L. major vs. E. coli: 0.9 Å for 117 equivalent C atoms; L. major vs. human: 1.2 Å; 115 atoms), HsGLO1 is over 40 residues longer than LmGLO1 and contains a number of extended loops that are absent in LmGLO1 and EcGLO1. LmGLO1 contains two significant structural differences from both EcGLO1 and HsGLO1 (Fig. 1B­D). First, the

loop between strands 6 and 7 is shortened by seven residues relative to EcGLO1, and five relative to HsGLO1. Second, the 15-residue C-terminal helix (3) is not present in EcGLO1 and although a helix is observed at the C-terminus of HsGLO1, it is in a different orientation and 10 residues shorter than in LmGLO1. Active site architecture The GLO1 active site (Fig. 3) can be divided into four regions: the catalytic metal centre, the -glutamatebinding residues, the methylglyoxal pocket and glycyl carboxylate- or amide-binding residues. The former two regions are highly conserved between structures, while the latter two regions display significant differences, and these are discussed below. We have been unable to determine the structure of LmGLO1 in complex with the glutathionylspermidine-based inhibitors, possibly due to the presence of two ordered 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) molecules in each active site: 3 M MPD is an essential component in our crystallization conditions. However, by superimposing coordinates from the HsGLO1-S-(Nhydroxy-N-p-iodophenylcarbamoyl)glutathione complex [1QIN (Cameron et al., 1999)] we can infer the positioning of all parts of the inhibitor except the spermidine group with some confidence. Metal coordination The GLO1 mechanism requires an octahedrally coordinated divalent metal ion ­ Ni2+ in the case of LmGLO1 ­ which coordinates the two oxygen atoms of the glyoxal moiety of the substrate, polarizing them and facilitating the rearrangement, via an enediolate intermediate, to D-lactate (see Himo and Siegbahn, 2001, for a detailed description). Satisfactory refinement of Ni2+ ions in the six active sites was achieved by assigning them an occupancy of 0.5, in agreement with atomic absorption spectrophotometry of LmGLO1 which indicated that 0.45 mol of Ni2+ and 0.05 mol of Zn2+ are present per active site (Vickers et al., 2004). The metal is coordinated in a distorted octahedron by residues His8, Glu59, His77*,

Leishmania major glyoxalase I structure and specificity 1243 arginine (Arg12) in LmGLO1 and EcGLO1 and two arginines in HsGLO1. This minor difference is redolent of glutathione reductase and trypanothione reductase where a -glutamyl-carboxylate-binding arginine is present in the former, but absent in the latter (Hunter et al., 1992). Methylglyoxal-binding pocket The three GLO1 molecules exhibit quite different active site shapes despite their global similarity: the EcGLO1 site is a narrow tube, the LmGLO1 site an open groove and the HsGLO1 site a small cup (Fig. 3A, C and E respectively). These differences are largely caused by the insertions and deletions illustrated in Fig. 1B­D. First, in both glutathione-dependent enzymes, residues from the loop between 6 and 7 interact with the loop between 2* and 3* forming a `roof' over the active site; via hydrophobic contacts in HsGLO1 (Lys156, Met157 interact with Phe62*, Met65*) and charged interactions in EcGLO1 (Lys104; Glu36*, Tyr37*). The truncation of the 6-7 loop in LmGLO1 removes this `roof', producing an open, more accessible active site. Second, both LmGLO1 and EcGLO1 lack the -helix observed in HsGLO1 that forms a hydrophobic `floor' to the ligand-binding pocket. In EcGLO1 this results in a second opening to the tubeshaped pocket, whereas in LmGLO1 the C-terminal helix from the other subunit occupies a similar position, producing a new `floor'. It is likely that a conspicuously exposed tryptophan (Trp35) in LmGLO1 will play a significant role in substrate binding as it extends into the active site and interacts favourably with one of the MPD molecules observed in the active site (yellow in Fig. 3D). This residue is substituted by Ser32 or Cys60 in EcGLO1 and HsGLO1, respectively, which one would expect to alter the properties of the pocket significantly, although we note that Cys60 in HsGLO1 structure 1QIP is covalently modified with mercaptoethanol, resulting in a more similar shape and hydrophobicity to tryptophan. Based on inspection of the HsGLO1-inhibitor complex structures, the difference in Ki values of 2­3 orders of magnitude between dinitrophenyl (1 and 3) and bromobenzyl (2 and 4) compounds is most obviously explained by the failure of the shorter dinitrophenyl compounds to be satisfactorily accommodated by both the glutathione-binding and methylglyoxal-binding regions of the active site. The additional methylene group present in 2 and 4 allows an improved fit to the active site. Glycyl carboxylate/amide binding residues The fundamental difference in substrate specificity between glutathione and trypanothione binding enzymes is based on how they differentially interact with the

Glu120* and two water molecules (Fig. 2). The coordination distances for the two waters are different, and the distances to the other ligating atoms are longer (> 2.20 Å) than typical for Ni2+ (approximately 2.06 Å), which would be commensurate with a mixture of apo and nickel-GLO1 based on the EcGLO1 structures (He et al., 2000). No increase in occupancy was produced by soaking crystals in NiCl2-containing solutions and supplementation of crystallization drops with additional NiCl2 inhibited crystallization. In addition, no alteration in enzyme activity was observed upon incubation of LmGLO1 with a 1000-fold molar excess of NiCl2 (data not shown). Our observation of one mole of Ni2+ bound per mole of dimer is also in agreement with previous analyses of the metal content and activity of the closely related EcGLO1 (Clugston et al., 1998; 2004). These data indicate that either there is extreme negative cooperativity in metal binding, or that the two active sites in the EcGLO1 or LmGLO1 dimer are non-identical in solution. However, these results conflict with structural analysis of EcGLO1, where two identical and fully occupied metal sites per dimer were observed (He et al., 2000). Surprisingly, neither the EcGLO1 or LmGLO1 structures provide any obvious indication as to how these enzymes might selectively bind 0.5 molar equivalents of metal, leaving this issue of `half-of-the-sites' reactivity unsolved.

-Glutamate-binding residues
The residues which bind the -glutamate moiety of the substrate are conserved in the GLO1 structures: The O2 and N1 atoms of an asparagine residue (Asn63 in LmGLO1) coordinate the -glutamate's primary ammonium and carboxylate groups respectively. The carboxylate is also coordinated by basic residues: a single

Leishmania major glyoxalase I structure and specificity 1245 predominantly small and negative glycyl carboxylate in the former, or the larger, positive/aliphatic glycyl-spermidine amide in the latter. In trypanothione reductase, this discrimination is facilitated by an enlarged active site and the substitution of a cluster of predominantly polar or positively charged residues for hydrophobic or negatively charged residues (Hunter et al., 1992). GLO1 is somewhat different in this respect as crystal structures of HsGLO1 with inhibitors (Cameron et al., 1997; 1999) indicate the glycyl carboxylate is either not directly coordinated by protein, or that it interacts with backbone nitrogen atoms. Significantly, these atoms lie on the 67 roof-forming loop mentioned above, which is truncated in LmGLO1. This truncation may allow the accommodation of the larger spermidine moiety, while the glycyl amide should be able to coordinate to the protein backbone as satisfactorily as a glycyl carboxylate. Spermidine-binding If the positioning of the glycyl moiety is indeed analogous to that observed in HsGLO1, then the spermidine group of glutathionylspermidine or trypanothione is anchored here. The spermidine group is highly flexible, but possible conformations that form contacts with the protein can be broadly classified into two groups: away from the methylglyoxal binding pocket or towards it. (Sample conformations for these two possibilities are modelled in Fig. 3C and D). A pair of variable sequence positions at the C-terminal end of 6 may be significant in ligand discrimination where the acidic residues Asp100 and Tyr101 are present in LmGLO1 in contrast to valine and arginine in HsGLO1 and threonine and lysine in EcGLO1. The negatively charged Asp100 provides a highly favourable binding position for a positively charged nitrogen atom (Fig. 3D; blue surface), which would be suitable for binding spermidine's secondary and tertiary ammoniums. The absence of an analogous but oppositely charged binding site for a carboxylate group in the HsGLO1 structure may explain why it is less discriminating against glycyl amides and esters: the LmGLO1 site cannot tolerate negative charge at this point, while the HsGLO1 site can tolerate a neutral amide linkage. The aliphatic segments of spermidine may also be accommodated by a hydrophobic pocket in LmGLO1 created by the substitution of tryptophan to Tyr118, where we observe an additional poorly ordered MPD molecule. In the alternative conformation, the spermidine could extend back over the active site to interact with the hydrophobic residues around the rim of the active site. Chemotherapeutic potential The mutually exclusive substrate specificities and substantial differences between the active sites of the L. major and human GLO1 enzymes indicate that selective inhibition of LmGLO1 may be possible. Moreover, the observation of a 24-fold difference between the human and the LmGLO1 enzymes' sensitivity towards inhibition by S-bromobenzylglutathionylspermidine suggests that the design of more potent and specific inhibitors of the LmGLO1 should be achievable. Despite this promise of selective inhibition of LmGLO1, recent modelling studies (Sousa Silva et al., 2005) raise the possibility that such inhibitors may not be toxic towards the parasite, and GLO1 has yet to be experimentally confirmed as essential for parasite survival. However, the production of methylglyoxal by triosephosphate isomerase should increase with glycolytic rate (Phillips and Thornalley, 1993) and GLO1 inhibitors have been shown to be selectively toxic to proliferating cells [possibly through accumulated methylglyoxal inhibiting DNA replication (Egyud and Szent-Gyorgyi, 1968; Ayoub et al., 1993)]. It is therefore possible that inhibition of the glyoxalase pathway in the rapidly dividing mammalian stages of these protozoa would be lethal. Further biochemical and genetic studies are now needed to illuminate the role that selective inhibition of GLO1 will play in future chemotherapy of leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis.

Experimental procedures Materials
Methylglyoxal was prepared from methylglyoxaldimethylacetal, as described (Pourmotabbed and Creighton, 1986). S-4bromobenzylglutathione and S-2,4-dinitrophenylglutathione were synthesized from glutathione, as described (Vince et al., 1971). Glutathione ethyl ester [H-Glu(CysGly-OEt)OH], glutathione isopropyl ester [H-Glu(CysGly-OIsp)-OH] and trypanothione and glutathionylspermidine disulphides were purchased from Bachem. Reduced trypanothione and glutathionylspermidine were produced from their disulphides using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine agarose, as described (Vickers et al., 2004).

Synthesis of glutathionylspermidine derivatives
Fully protected N1-glutathionylspermidine was prepared as described (Henderson et al., 1986). This peptide was dissolved in THF/H2O (1:1), the pH adjusted to 9 with N,Ndiisopropylethylamine and dithiothreitol (DTT; 2 eq) added to liberate the cysteinyl sulphydryl group. After stirring under argon for 24 h, the partially deprotected intermediate was extracted with ether, these extracts washed twice with water and then evaporated to dryness. The crude product was redissolved in THF, the pH adjusted to 9 as before and the appropriate alkylating agent (4-bromobenzyl bromide or 2,4dinitrofluorobenzene; 2 eq) then added. After stirring under argon for 24 h, alkylated products were isolated by ethyl acetate and water extraction and then purified by silica gel chromatography. Final deprotection was effected with excess

Protein expression and purification
HsGLO1 was expressed and purified essentially as described (Ridderstrom et al., 1996), although the published bacterial growth medium was replaced with terrific broth containing 1 mM zinc chloride and 100 µg ml-1 carbenicillin. LmGLO1 was expressed and the holoenzyme purified as described (Vickers et al., 2004).

GLO1 assay
Kinetic constants of the human and L. major enzymes with various thiol hemithioacetals were determined at 27°C in 0.5 ml assays containing 100 mM (Na+) phosphate, pH 7. The required concentration of hemithioacetal and 0.1 mM free thiol were produced by varying the thiol and methylglyoxal concentrations, with the concentrations quoted of the dithiol trypanothione being that of the sulphydryl group. As previous studies showed that modification of the glutathione glycyl-carboxyl group did not alter the position of hemithioacetal equilibria (Vickers et al., 2004), all hemithioacetal concentrations were calculated using the glutathionemethylglyoxal Kd of 3 mM. Where Km values were too large for accurate measurement of kinetic constants, kcat/Km values were determined from the slope of plots of rate vs. enzyme concentration. LmGLO1 assays were initiated by addition of enzyme diluted to the required concentration (< 200 nM in all cases) using 100 mM (Na+) phosphate, pH 7 containing 20 µM NiCl2 and 0.05% (w/v) BSA. Kinetic data were fitted using the program GRAFIT (Erithacus Software Limited; R. Leatherbarrow). Inhibition constants for human and parasite GLO1 were determined over a range of substrate concentrations (0.5­2.5 times Km with the hemithioacetals of glutathione or glutathionylspermidine, respectively) at three fixed concentrations of inhibitors 1­4. Linear LineweaverBurk transformations of each data set were inspected for inhibition pattern (competitive in all cases). Replots of slope (Kmapp/Vmax) vs. inhibitor concentration were inspected for linearity (linear in all cases). Finally, data sets for each inhibitor were globally fitted by non-linear regression to the equation for linear competitive inhibition using GRAFIT to obtain best-fit values and standard errors for Ki.

Non-protein atoms were removed prior to the calculation of electrostatic potentials [APBS (Baker et al., 2001)] and favourable interaction sites [XSITE (Laskowski et al., 1996)]. Molecular graphics figures were prepared with PYMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge.net) and the sequence figure with ALINE (available from the authors).

Crystallization, structure solution and refinement
Full details of crystallization and molecular replacement of LmGLO1 are reported elsewhere (Ariza et al., 2005), resulting in refinement of three protein dimers per asymmetric unit against a data set to 2.0 Å in spacegroup P 21 21 2 (details are presented in Table 3). TLS and restrained refinement [REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997); CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994)] were interspersed with validation [PROCHECK; WHATCHECK (Hooft et al., 1996)] and manual model-building [COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004)] yielding a model of six protein subunits
