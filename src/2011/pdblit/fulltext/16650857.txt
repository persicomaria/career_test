Abstract A gene encoding N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR) from Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413 was cloned. An analysis of its sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding 368 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of NAAAR showed an 89% identity with that of Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1­ 60. The N-acylamino acid racemase gene (aaar) was subcloned into expression vector pET-17b, and was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). A 41-kDa protein band was present on the SDS-PAGE gel from the intracellular soluble part of E. coli. The recombinant NAAAR produced in E. coli was purified by Toyopearl DEAE-650M and Sephacryl S-200 h chromatography. The molecular weight of NAAAR, determined by gel-filtration chromatography, was 320 kDa, indicating that NAAAR was composed of eight identical subunits. NAAAR had maximal activity at 40°C and pH 7.4. The enzyme activity was enhanced notably by Co2 and Mn2 . Substrate specificity revealed that N-acetyl-D-methionine, N-acetyl- L-methionine, N-acetyl-D-tyrosine, N-acetyl-Lvaline, and N-chloroacetyl -D-phenylalanine were the effective substrates. For the substrate N- acetyl-D-methionine, Km was 27.8 mM with a Vmax of 0.07 mol 1 min 1 and a kcat/Km of 311.4 M 1 s 1. Our data revealed that this N-acylamino acid racemase has a broad substrate range. In addition, we procured the distribution of sequence-conserved regions from known NAAARs and putative NAAARs in this study. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Optically active D-amino acids are widely used as intermediates in the synthesis of semisynthetic antibiotics, peptide hormones, and pesticides, and they are important chiral building blocks for a number of fine chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and food additives [1,2]. Several attempts have been made to synthesize D-amino acids enzymatically [3­5], including the process of coupling N-acylamino acid racemase and D-aminoacylase, using Nacetyl-D, L-amino acid as substrates [6 ­9]. The final yield of D-amino acids can approach more than 99%, which is higher than the 50% yield from the enzymatic resolution of racemic N-acetyl amino acids by D-aminoacylase alone. N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR) is a specific enzyme that catalyzes the racemization of optical N-acylamino acids but not of optical amino acids. According to the report [6],

NAAAR is widely distributed among actinomycetes, including the genera Streptomyces, Actinomadura, Actinomyces, Jensenia, Amycolatopsis, and Sebekia. NAAAR is a unique racemase that requires divalent metal ions for enzyme activity but not pyridoxal 5 -phosphate. Having been placed into the enolase superfamily, N-acylamino acid racemase retains the ability to catalyze the thermodynamically difficult step of proton abstraction [10]. The enzymes of the enolase superfamily are related by their ability to catalyze the abstraction of the -proton of a carboxylic acid to form an enolic intermediate. N-acetyl-D, L-amino acids have already been used as substrates in producing L-amino acids by using immobilized L-aminoacylases in an industrial processes [11]. Now, it is discovered that NAAAR has been found could catalyze the racemization of N-acyl-D- or L-amino acids. When coupled with suitable aminioacylase, this process for produce optically active amino acids prevents additional separation procedure. Therefore, the NAAAR enzyme is considered to be very important for industrial applications. In this paper, we tried screening several actinomycetes strains

for the production of the N-acylamino acid racemase. We cloned a aaar gene from Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), overexpressed it in E. coli cells, and purified it, as well as biochemically characterizing the gene product. Although the N-acylamino acid racemase has been discovered from Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1­ 60 [7­9] and Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. lurida [12], there are some kinetic problems restricting its application in commercial processes. In this study, we procured the distributions of sequence-conserved regions from the known NAAARs and putative NAAARs. In order to overcome the problems associated with using this enzyme, protein engineering could be used. Before we obtaining NAAAR's crystal structure, the information from enzyme characterization and sequences alignment would be valuable for further study.

coli XL1-Blue and E. coli BL21(DE3) were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani broth; these were used as a transformation host and an expression host, respectively. Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. 2.3. Cloning of the aaar gene and recombinant DNA techniques The presence of the aaar gene in our collected strains was screened by PCR amplification using two primers: 5 -TGCGGATCAAGCTTAAGATCG-3 (designated F2) and 5 -TTTGATGTTCACGATTTGGACCGCGC -3 (designated 10I). The genomic DNA of the collected strains was prepared according to "current protocols in molecular biology" [13], and this was used as templates for PCR. The PCR primers were designed based on the aaar gene sequence of Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1­ 60 (accession number D30738). According with results from the PCR reaction, Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413 was selected, and the aaar gene was cloned as follows. We used pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and primers 5 -GTGAAACTCAGCGGTGT-3 (designated aaarPF1) and 5 -CCGACCAAATCTACCTCC-3 (designated aaarR1), to amplify the aaar gene by the PCR method. The PCR primer pair, aaarPF1 and aaarR1, were designed from 5 and 3 ends of the aaar gene sequence of Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1­ 60, respectively. Amplified aaar DNA fragments were purified with a QIAquick Gel-extraction kit (Qiagen). The generation of T-A overhangs for the DNA fragment, described as "current protocols in molecular biology," these were then ligated with pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) to obtain the recombinant plasmid, pAr1. 2.4. DNA sequence determination and analysis The nucleotide sequence of aaar gene in pAr1 was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method [14] with an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit and an ABI PRISM 377­96 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems, Faster

The amino acid sequence was compared by PSI-BLAST [15], and the multiple sequence alignment was achieved by Clustal W, [16]. 2.5. Enzyme purification E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pAr3 (Table 1) was subcultured at 37°C for 10-h in a test tube containing 3 ml Luria-Bertani medium, supplemented with 100 g ampicillin ml 1. The subculture was then inoculated into 500-ml flasks, each containing 100 ml Luria-Bertani medium, supplemented with 100 g ampicillin ml 1 ampicillin. After a 4-h incubation at 37°C on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm, isopropylthio- -D-galactoside (at a final concentration of 0.1 mM) was added to the culture broth, and incubation was continued for another 24 h at 28°C with reciprocal shaking. All purification procedures were performed at a temperature lower than 5°C, unless otherwise noted. The buffer used throughout this study was Tris/HCl (pH 7.5, 50 mM). Then cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 10 min at 4°C and washed with buffer. The 0.6-L culture was suspended in 30 ml of buffer and was disrupted by sonication for 7 min 30 s (Sonicator, Ultrasonic processor XL, Heat Systems), followed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant solution was loaded onto a DEAE Toyopearl 650M (Tosoh Tokyo, Japan) column (1.6 12 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer, and the adsorbed protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 0.5 M NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min 1. The active fractions were combined, concentrated by centriprep YM-10 (Amicon), and then applied to a Sephacryl S-200 h column, equilibrated with 50 mM buffer containing 150 mM NaCl. The column was eluted at 0.2 ml min 1, and the active fractions were collected and assayed. 2.6. Enzyme assay N-acylamino acid racemase activity was assayed as follows. The reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained Tris/HCl buffer (25 mol, pH 7.5), N-acetyl-D-methionine (12.5 mol), Co2 (1 mol), and an appropriate amount of the enzyme. After the addition of enzymes, the mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min, and the reaction was discontinued by heating at 95°C for 5 min. Optical resolution and simultaneous measurement of N-acyl-D-methionine, N-acyl-L-methonine, D-methionine, and L-methionine from the enzyme reaction mixture were conducted using a ChiroBiotic T column (0.46 25 cm) (Astec). The flow rate was 0.5 ml min 1 using 0.1% triethyl acetic acetate (TEAA, pH 4.0), dH2O, and methanol (5:15:80, v/v) as a solvent, under monitorization at 210 nm [17]. NAAAR activity was also measured spectrophotometrically at 520 nm by coupling the oxidation of L-amino acids

with L-amino acid oxidase. The reaction mixture was prepared as described previously, and then 5 U of L-aminoacylase was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min at 30°C. The assay mixture was comprised of 0.07 U L-amino acid oxidase, 7.5 mol Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 10 l of test sample, and 20 l of detection reagent (containing 500 U horse radish peroxidase, 10 mg 4-aminoantipyrine, 0.2 ml phenol, and 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, in a final volume of 5 ml). The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and the absorbance at 520 nm was compared with a calibration curve obtained using L-methionine. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the forma-

To determine the Michaelis constants, the reaction was performed by the enzyme assay method as described above, with different concentrations of N-acetyl-D-methionine and N-acetyl-D-phenylalanine. The inhibition test was evaluated by using 2 to 200 M of salicylhydroxamate. 2.7. Determination of the relative molecular mass The molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined by gel filtration using a TSK G-3000 SW column (0.75 30 cm, Tosoh), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min 1, with 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 M Na2SO4 at room temperature. The molecular mass of the enzyme was then calculated from the relative mobility compared with those of standard proteins, thyroglobulin (670 kDa), gamma globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.4 kDa) (Bio-Rad).

PCR product at the predicted size of 317 bp. This culture was grown in TSB for three days, and afterwards centrifuged, with the cells disrupted by sonication. The resulting crude extracts showed NAAAR activity, as analyzed by the chiral-HPLC method (Fig. 1). The entire aaar gene in A. azurea CCRC13413 was then amplified by PCR with aaarPF1 and aaarR1 primers and was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector. The recombinant plasmid pAr1 containing a 1140-bp fragment was screened. It was sequenced in both directions, and the nucleotide sequencing of this fragment revealed the presence of an open reading frame, consisting of 1104 bp and coding for a protein of 368 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 39,550 Da. 3.2. Nucleotide sequence analysis and sequence alignment of NAAARs The nucleotide sequence of aaar from A. azurea CCRC 13413 revealed relatively high similarity with seven proteins in databases (Table 2). Alignment by the PSI-BLAST program presented that the deduced amino acid of NAAAR from Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413 of 89% and 95% identity, compared with that of Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1­ 60 [8] and Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. lurida [12], respectively. This NAAAR protein also displayed 46%, 39%, 44%, and 39% identity with the probable NAAAR of Aeropyrum pernix, Thermoplasma acidophilum, Deinococcus radiodurans, and ytfD of Bacillus subtilis, respectively [19 ­22] (Table 2). Alignment of these eight related proteins is shown in Fig. 2. The KXK functional motif (K161, K163), acid/base catalysis site (K263), and the predicted metal ion ligand residues (D179, D239, E214) were conserved in the NAAAR of Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413, along with other related proteins. From the sequence alignment, we found a Mandelate racemase/mu-

Expression of the aaar gene in E. coli and enzyme purification The aaar gene was amplified with primers Ar-Sac (5 -GCGGGAGCTCGATTATGAAACTCA-3 ) and ArXho3 (5 -TCTACCTCGAGAATTCGTAGTTGGCTA-3 ). Primer Ar- Sac introduced a SacI site (underlined sequence), replacing the GTG start codon with ATG (bold letters) at the translation start codon; primer Ar-Xho3 introduced an XhoI site (underlined sequence) at the stop codon. Amplified DNA containing the aaar gene was cloned into the protein fusion vector, pET17b, as a SacI-XhoI fragment. This plasmid was designated pAr2. Finally, we deleted the T7 tag site on pAr2 by digestion with NdeI and HindIII, which yielded plasmid pAr3. Expression of E. coli BL21(DE3) was performed as recommended by the supplier (Novagen). The specific activity of N-acylamino acid racemase in the supernatant of sonicated cell-free extracts of transformants was 30 mU mg 1. Recombinant NAAAR was purified from E. coli

BL21(DE3), harboring pAr3 with a recovery rate of 8.7% by DEAE-Toyopearl and Sephacryl-S200 column chromatography. The specific activity of purified NAAAR was 1.08 U mg 1, with a protein purification factor of 37.2. The purification results are summarized in Table 3. A SDSPAGE analysis of purified NAAAR showed a band of 41 kDa, while the molecular mass determined by gel filtration was about 320 kDa (Fig. 3). The protein appeared to consist of eight identical subunits. 3.4. Effect of temperature and pH on NAAAR The optimal temperature of this enzyme is 40°C when using N-acetyl-D-methionine as the substrate (Fig. 4A). After incubation of this enzyme at 45°C of pH 7.5 for 30 min, this enzyme still had 80% of remaining activity. The maximum activity of NAAAR occurred between pH 6.8 and 8.6 at 40°C (Fig. 4B). 3.5. Effect of metal ions and chemical reagents on NAAAR NAAAR was incubated with various metal ions and reagents in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), with relative activity was measured under assay conditions as described

in "Materials and Methods," except for the substitution of various metal salts with CoCl2. The effect of various ions upon NAAAR activity is shown in Table 4. The enzyme was significantly activated by Co2 and Mn2 ; a three- to four-fold stimulation of enzyme activity was also observed with Mg2 and Fe2 . In contrast, 1 mM of Cu2 and Ca2 completely inhibited the activity of NAAAR. However, the activity of NAAAR was also slightly inhibited by 10 mM of Ni2 and Zn2 (Table 4). The reducing agents, 1 mM DTT and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, completely inhibited the enzyme activity. These results indicate that DTT is more effective than 2-mercaptoethanol, in inhibiting NAAAR activity. 3.6. Substrate specificity and enzyme kinetics Initial studies on the substrate specificity of homogeneous NAAAR were carried out with 25 mM of substrate, and the enzyme was assayed using chiral-HPLC. The following N-acetyl-D-methionine, N-acetyl-L-methionine, Nacetyl-D-tyrosine, N-acetyl-L-valine, and N-chloroacetylD-phenylalanine were good substrates (Table 5). The enzyme did not catalyze the racemization of D-methionine, L-methionine, or N-acetyl-arginine. After incubation with NAAAR for 20-h, the substrate conversion ratios were found to be around 50%, including N-acetyl derivatives of

methionine and leucine, and N-acyl derivatives of aromatic amino acids such as N-acetyl-phenylalanine, N-acetyl-tyrosine, and N-chloroacetyl-phenylalanine (Table 5). Data reveal that N-acylamino acid racemase has a broad substrate range; however, N-acetyl-D-methionine and N-acetyl-Lmethionine are the best substrates. This enzyme's activity obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km and kcat/Km values were 27.8 mM and 3.11 102 M 1S 1, respectively, for N-acetyl-D-methionine. It was also found that NAAAR was competitively inhibited by salicylhydroxamate, with a Ki value of 42.5 M (Fig. 5).

4. Discussion N-acylamino acid racemase is a useful enzyme for producing optically active amino acids. In this study, we have selected an N-acylamino acid racemase producing strain, Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413, and cloned the aaar gene. We have demonstrated that the gene codes for Nacylamino acid racemase, which can racemize N-acyl-derivative amino acids, but cannot act on amino acids. For N-acyl derivatives of nonpolar or uncharged R groups of amino acids, the enzyme reaction preferred the L-form substrate; but when using N-acyl derivatives of aromatic R groups of amino acids as the substrates, the enzyme reaction

The optimum temperature tests were done at different temperatures for 10 min, and the optimum pH was determined by incubation of the enzyme between pH 3.6 and 10.6. The enzyme activity was determined by the L-amino acid oxidase assay method, as described in "Materials and Methods."

preferred the D-form substrate (Table 5). This enzyme possessed broad substrate range. Comparing the substrate specificity of NAAAR among Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413, Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1­ 60 [7], and Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. lurida [12], the NAAAR from Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413 can racemize the Nacetyl-D-tyrosine but Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1­ 60 cannot. The NAAAR from Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413 can racemize the N-acetyl-D, L-leucine but Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. lurida cannot display this property. From the sequence alignments between NAAAR of Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC 13413, Amycolatopsis sp. TS1­ 60, Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. lurida and other putative NAAARs (Fig. 2), we derived the distributions of conserved regions between them. Thus far, the NAAAR is unsuitable for use in industrial applications. The enzyme activity and substrate inhibition must be improved. Before we obtaining the crystal structure of NAAAR, information

that the NAAAR of Amycolatopsis azurea, Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1­ 60, and Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. lurida should provide alternative activities, partaking an important role in orthologous OSBSs' evolution. Other putative NAAAR sequences from Aeropyrum pernix K1, Deinococcus radiodurans R1, and Thermoplasma acidophilum, have been found from searching data files for sequence similarity. None of these were proven to possess NAAAR activity as yet. Since enzymes have been found to possess an alternative activities [25], and the potential role of catalytic promiscuity is for successful use in protein engineering [26], in the future, we need further in depth studies between NAAARs of Amycolatopsis sp. and putative NAAARs.

Fig. 5. Kinetic parameters of the N-acylamino acid racemase racemization reaction and reaction inhibition by salicylhydroxamate. The initial rate of racemase activity was measured at standard reaction conditions. The concentration of salicylhydroxamate was 20 M, and that of N-acetyl-Dmethionine was 5 to 50 mM. The enzyme activity was determined by the L-amino acid oxidase assay method.

enzyme (MLE), a subfamily of the enolase superfamily [10]; furthermore, it has recently been considered to be an o-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS) [23]. Our results showed that NAAAR from Amycolatopsis azure CCRC 13413 produce racemization activity for N-acylamino acids. In our inhibition kinetics study, we also found that salicylhydroxamate, an analog of 2-hydroxy-6-succinyl-2, 4 ­ cyclohexadiene carboxylate (SHCHC), competitively inhibited the activity of NAAAR with Ki of 42.5 M (Fig. 5). Furthermore, SHCHC was the reaction substrate of o-succinylbenzoate synthase. This revealed that NAAAR from Amycolatopsis azurea also has the OSBS property. Recently, Thompson et al. [24] elucidated the protein structure of OSBS from E. coli observing it as monomeric among crystal lattice, and reporting that it may possibly dimerize weakly in solution. However, our data (Fig. 3) and Tokuyama et al. [7], Verseck et al. [12] revealed that the active form of NAAAR from Amycolatopsis sp., should be octamers. Besides, the o-succinylbenzoate synthase gene of E. coli (menC) and Bacillus subtilis (ytfD) have been demonstrated as located in a menaquinone biosynthesis gene cluster [23]. And it deserves to be mentioned that our unpublished data showed that the aaar gene of Amycolatopsis azurea doesn't fit within a menaquinone biosynthesis gene cluster. Even though the N-acylamino acid racemase has been considered to be o-succinylbenzoate synthase, we believe that the physiological functions of this enzyme still need further study. Among homologous proteins with N-acylamino acid racemase, the YtfD of Bacillus subtilis has been proved to be an OSBS. The YtfD of Bacillus subtilis and OSBS of E. coli showed no activity for N-acylamino acid racemase [23]. According with previous reports and our study, we believed
