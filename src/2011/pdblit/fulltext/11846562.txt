Structures of SAP-1 Bound to DNA Targets from the E74 and c-fos Promoters: Insights into DNA Sequence Discrimination by Ets Proteins
Yi Mo,* Benjamin Vaessen,* Karen Johnston,* and Ronen Marmorstein* * The Wistar Institute  Department of Chemistry University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 45 eukaryotic members that usually bind DNA as heteromeric protein complexes (Sharrocks et al., 1997). Proteins within this family are found in species from fruit flies to humans and regulate multiple genes involved in cellular growth and development (Bassuk and Leiden, 1997). Interestingly, the genes encoding Ets proteins are frequent targets for chromosomal translocations resulting in various types of leukemias (Bassuk and Leiden, 1997). The Ets proteins all share a highly conserved ETS DNA-binding domain of roughly 85 amino acid residues that mediates binding to a DNA target harboring a central GGA core sequence. DNA binding specificity by the majority of Ets proteins is further augmented by the DNA base pairs that flank the central GGA core sequence, and by the interaction of a heteromeric protein partner that also binds DNA in a sequence-specific fashion. The structures of several ETS domains have been determined using both X-ray crystallographic and NMR techniques. The structures of the nascent ETS domains from Ets-1 (Donaldson et al., 1996) and Fli-1 (Liang et al., 1994), and the DNA-bound domains of Ets-1 (Werner et al., 1995, 1996) and PU.1 (Kodandapani et al., 1996) have been determined. The structure of the ETS domain from GABP has also been determined in ternary complex with GABP and DNA (Batchelor et al., 1998). A comparison of these structures has revealed that the ETS domain forms a winged helix-turn-helix topology (Brennan, 1993) in which conserved residues function to stabilize the hydrophobic core of the protein and to interact specifically with a GGA core sequence. The ternary complex factors (TCFs) are a subgroup of Ets proteins that cooperate with the MADS box transcription factor family member SRF (serum response factor) (Shore and Sharrocks, 1995a) to regulate transcription of the immediate early c-fos protooncogene (Treisman, 1994). TCF function is mediated by the cooperative binding of the TCF and SRF proteins to adjacent DNA targets at the serum response element (SRE) of the c-fos promoter region. To date, three human TCFs have been identified: Elk-1 (Ets-like) (Rao et al., 1989), SAP-1 (SRF accessory protein) (Dalton and Treisman, 1992), and SAP-2 (Price et al., 1995). A murine TCF homolog of SAP-2 has also been identified (Giovane et al., 1994; Lopez et al., 1994). In addition to the conserved N-terminal ETS domain, the TCFs share two other regions of similarity: a 20­amino acid region C-terminal to the ETS domain called the B box that mediates interaction with SRF (Treisman, 1994; Price et al., 1995; Ling et al., 1997) and a more C-terminal region that serves as a target for phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase for transactivation of the c-fos gene (Cahill et al., 1996). Analysis of the DNA binding properties of the recombinant ETS domains from the SAP-1 and Elk-1 proteins has shown that although these proteins select similar DNA sequences, SAP-1 exhibits a more "relaxed" binding site selectivity than Elk-1 (Shore and Sharrocks, 1995b; Shore et al., 1995, 1996). The ETS domains from

Summary SAP-1 is a member of the Ets transcription factors and cooperates with SRF protein to activate transcription of the c-fos protooncogene. The crystal structures of the conserved ETS domain of SAP-1 bound to DNA sequences from the E74 and c-fos promoters reveal that a set of conserved residues contact a GGA core DNA sequence. Discrimination for sequences outside this core is mediated by DNA contacts from conserved and nonconserved protein residues and sequencedependent DNA structural properties characteristic of A-form DNA structure. Comparison with the related PU.1/DNA and GABP / /DNA complexes provides general insights into DNA discrimination between Ets proteins. Modeling studies of a SAP-1/SRF/DNA complex suggest that SRF may modulate SAP-1 binding to DNA by interacting with its ETS domain. Introduction Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins use a diverse set of mechanisms to discriminate among different DNA target sites (Nelson, 1995). Many of these proteins bind to DNA as homo- or heteromeric protein complexes. The subunits of homomeric DNA-binding proteins often mediate DNA recognition by contacting two "half-sites" located at the ends of the DNA target. In such cases, sequence-specific binding is dictated by either proteinspecific DNA contacts at the half-site sequences, by distinctive dimerization interfaces that specify the base pair separation between these half-sites, or by a combination of both mechanisms. For example, the prokaryotic helix-turn-helix family of transcription factors all bind as dimers to DNA targets that are characterized by their half-site sequences (Harrison and Aggarwal, 1990). Alternatively, a subset of the Zn2 Cys6 family of fungal DNA-binding proteins recognizes common DNA half sites and a unique base pair spacing between these sites (Swaminathan et al., 1997). In heteromeric protein/ DNA complexes, a protein monomer or dimer recognizes a central core DNA sequence, while an accessory protein(s) binds nearby in a cooperative fashion. In this case, DNA binding specificity is achieved by sequences that flank the core DNA target and through interactions between the respective heteromeric protein subunit(s). The Ets DNA-binding proteins form a family of at least

both proteins display optimal binding to a DNA sequence that is identical to a natural target for the Drosophilia E74 Ets protein, 5 -ACCGGAAGT-3 (E74DNA). In contrast, the target sequence found in the c-fos promoter, 5 -ACAGGATGT-3 (c-fosDNA), is bound with high affinity by SAP-1 but is not bound detectably by Elk-1. Interestingly, the residues proposed to contact DNA are strictly conserved between SAP-1 and Elk-1. To study the DNA binding specificity determinants for the SAP-1 protein, we have determined the highresolution crystal structures of its ETS domain bound to DNA sequences from the E74 and c-fos promoters. These structures reveal that a set of conserved residues contact the GGA core sequence, while conserved and nonconserved residues coupled with sequence-dependent DNA structural properties characteristic of A-form DNA mediate specificty for the base pairs flanking the core. We compare the SAP-1/DNA complexes with the structures of other ETS domain/DNA complexes and provide general insights into how different ETS domains discriminate between related DNA targets. We also discuss how interactions with the SRF accessory protein may modulate the DNA binding properties of the SAP-1 and Elk-1 proteins. Results and Discussion Overall Structure of SAP-1 in Complex with DNA The structures of the ETS domain from the mammalian SAP-1 protein bound to two different DNA targets, a natural site found in the human c-fos promoter (SAP-1/ c-fosDNA) and a high-affinity site found in the Drosophila E74 promoter (SAP-1/E74DNA), have been determined to high resolution by X-ray crystallography (Figure 1). The overall structures of the SAP-1/E74DNA and the SAP-1/ c-fosDNA complexes are highly similar with an rms devia° tion of 0.73 A for the backbone C atoms of the protein ° and 0.61 A for C1 atoms of the DNA. Most of the structural deviations in the complexes are localized to the extreme N and C termini and some surface loop regions of the protein, and to the DNA backbone regions that flank the GGA core sequence. The protein adopts an / fold packing three helices against four antiparallel strands to form an extensive hydrophobic core. The overall topology is similar to the "winged-helix-turnhelix" motif (Brennan, 1993) (Figures 2A and 2B). The DNA duplex is smoothly curved approximately 11 around the protein such that the DNA recognition helix of SAP-1 (helix 3) is embedded into the DNA major groove. A "wing" emanating from the 3-turn- 4 hairpin

and a turn separating helices 2 and 3 flanking the DNA recognition helix are anchored to opposite strands of the DNA. The shape and charge character of the protein surface facing the DNA is highly complementary to the major and minor groove surfaces of the DNA that face the protein. The overall SAP-1/DNA complex is remarkably similar to the structure of other ETS domain/DNA complexes determined by X-ray crystallography. Comparisons with the GABP / /DNA (Batchelor et al., 1998) and PU.1/ DNA (Kodandapani et al., 1996) complexes show rms deviations between the C atoms of the ETS domains ° ° to be 0.73 A and 1.2 A, respectively (Figure 2C), with rms deviations between the C1 atoms of the central ° ° 9­base pair DNA targets to be 0.45 A and 0.75 A , respectively (Figure 2D). The topology of the SAP-1 ETS domain is also similar to that of the ETS domains of Ets-1 (Werner et al., 1995, 1996; Donaldson et al., 1996) and Fli-1 (Liang et al., 1994) determined by solution NMR techniques. Taken together, the overall structural homology among ETS domains appears to be very high. The winged helix-turn-helix topology found in ETS domains extends to other DNA-binding proteins, most notably GH5 (Ramakrishnan et al., 1993), HNF-3 (Clark et al., 1993), HSF (Harrison et al., 1994), and IRF-1 (Escalante et al., 1998), with the greatest variability found in the loop regions that separate secondary structural elements. DNA complexes with HNF-3 (Clark et al., 1993) and IRF-1 (Escalante et al., 1998) also show general similarities to the ETS/DNA complexes, although the details of the base-specific interactions are different. In each case, a recognition helix is embedded into the major groove, and loop regions that flank the recognition helix are tethered to the phosphate backbone in the minor grooves of the DNA. Each of these structures also shows a comparably smooth bend in the DNA to accommodate the interactions made with the protein. The observation that transcription factors with little sequence homology use similar scaffolds to recognize DNA suggests that the winged helix-turn-helix topology may be a highly efficient way for a monomeric protein subunit to recognize DNA. In fact, the solvent-accessible surface that is buried by these complexes is on the ° order of 1800 A2, which is comparable to the solventaccessible surface buried in DNA complexes with some ° dimeric DNA-binding proteins such as GAL4 (2600 A2 ) ° (Marmorstein et al., 1992) and GCN4 (2300 A2) (Ellenberger et al., 1992). The E74 and c-fos DNA targets show deviations from standard B-form geometry. In addition to displaying a

smooth bend of approximately 11 (Lavery and Sklenar, 1989), the DNA targets show some characteristics of A-form DNA geometry that are exemplified by the presence of a pronounced hole down the DNA helical axis (Figure 2B) (Wahl and Sundaralingam, 1997). More specifically, both DNA sequences bound to SAP-1 show A-form characteristics with respect to base pair displacement, base pair inclination, base pair rise, base pair roll, and helical twist (Table 1). This type of DNA structure, which has also been noted in other protein/ DNA complexes (most notably the GLI Zn-finger protein and trp repressor) and has been classified as a Beg-DNA

(for enlarged major groove) subclass of DNA structure (Nekludova and Pabo, 1994). As will be discussed below, this nonstandard DNA geometry appears to play an important role in DNA recognition by SAP-1. DNA Recognition by SAP-1 The SAP-1 DNA targets used in this study differ only in the two base pairs that flank the GGA core sequence (Figure 1B). With the exception of these two base pairs, the ETS domain of SAP-1 makes very similar contacts with both the natural c-fos and high-affinity E74 DNA targets (Figure 1C). For ease of discussion, we have

numbered the bases starting with 1 for the first G of the GGA core, with complementary base pairs assigned the prime designation ( ) (Figure 1B). Common Features of the SAP-1/E74DNA and SAP-1/c-fosDNA Complexes The SAP-1 protein is anchored to both the c-fos and E74 DNA targets by extensive direct and water-mediated interactions with the phosphate backbone region of the DNA that flanks the GGA core sequence. Directly 5 to the GGA core, residues in the 3-turn- 4 hairpin called the "wing" (Lys-74, Asn-76, Lys-79, Phe-80, and Tyr-82) and part of the 3 helix (Tyr-56, Arg-64, and Tyr-67) contact backbone nucleotides A 3, C 2, C 1, and G 1 on one strand of the DNA (Figure 1C). Residues from the C-terminal region of the 2 helix (Trp-45 and Lys-49), the proceeding turn (Lys-51 and Asn-53), and the 3 helix (Lys-58, Tyr-66, and Lys-69) anchor the SAP-1 protein to the primed DNA strand on the 3 side of the GGA core sequence: A 6 , C 5 , T 4 , T 3 , and C 2 (Figure 1C). The DNA phosphate interactions described above position the 3 "recognition helix" of SAP-1 into the DNA major groove to make extensive direct and water-mediated interactions with the GGA core sequence (Figures 3A and 3B). Arg-64 specifies the first base pair in the GGA core by hydrogen bonding to G 1, and Arg-61 and Asp-57 specify the second base pair of the GGA core by hydrogen bonding to G 2 and C 2 (water-mediated), respectively. The third base pair of the GGA core is contacted by residues Arg-61, Tyr-65, and Lys-58. Both the E74DNA and c-fosDNA complexes show van der Waals interactions between the 3 recognition helix and the cytosine of base pair five 3 of the GGA core. This interaction correlates well with the binding site selection studies for the SAP-1 and the related Elk-1 proteins (Shore and Sharrocks, 1995b) (Table 2). These studies show that a G-C is preferred over an A-T base pair at this position, while a C-G or T-A base pair prevents binding. Consistent with this finding, modeling studies show that the 5-methyl group of the thymine would fulfill a similar role at the 5 position of the replaced cytosine, while a T-A or C-G base pair would cause an unfavorable interaction with the ring of Tyr-65.

Differences between the SAP-1/E74DNA and SAP-1/c-fosDNA Complexes Differential interactions made by SAP-1 to the E74DNA and c-fosDNA targets are largely restricted to the two divergent base pairs that flank the GGA core sequence (Figures 1C, 3A, and 3B). Overall, the interactions made with the E74 DNA site are more extensive and account for the greater overall affinity of the isolated ETS domains of SAP-1 and the homologous protein Elk-1 for this site (Shore and Sharrocks, 1995b). 3 to the GGA core, the E74 DNA site has an A-T base pair while the c-fosDNA site has a T-A base pair. Tyr-65 participates in specifying this base pair in both cases (Figure 1C). In the E74DNA complex, the tyrosine hydrogen bonds to A 4 and A 3 (water-mediated) and makes van der Waals interactions with T 4 . In the c-fosDNA complex, the tyrosine contacts T 4, A 3, A 4 , and T 4 (water-mediated). Specificity for the A-T base pair at position 4 in the E74 DNA complex is also supplemented by van der Waals interactions between Ala-62 of the 3 helix and T 4 . Binding site selection studies with the SAP-1 and Elk-1 proteins show a strict preference for a CC at positions 1 and 2 just 5 to the GGA core DNA sequence (Shore and Sharrocks, 1995b). The structure of the E74 DNA complex reveals that this preference is mediated by both protein­DNA contacts and DNA conformational properties. The conformation of the DNA in the SAP-1 complexes has many characteristics of A-form geometry (Table 1), and the resultant CCGG sequence (E74DNA) that extends into the GGA core sequence has a high propensity to adopt A-form DNA structure. Presumably, substitution of either C 1 or C 2 destabilizes the A-type properties of the DNA required to facilitate the interactions made between the SAP-1 3 recognition helix with the DNA major groove. Specificity for C 1 is supplemented by a hydrogen bond from Asp-57 and a van der Waals contact from the aliphatic sidechain of Arg-64. In the c-fosDNA complex, the analogous A-T base pair at position 1 of the DNA is involved in only a relatively weak van der Waals interaction with the aliphatic side chain of Arg-64 (to A 1). Interestingly, the contact made by Asp-57 to C 1 in the E74 DNA complex is replaced by a water-mediated contact to the phosphate of A 3 in the c-fosDNA complex.

Taken together, the structures for the E74DNA and c-fosDNA complexes correlate well with the dependence of SAP-1 on a GGA core sequence and its strong preference for AG and CC sequences just 3 and 5 to the

core, respectively. Interestingly, the ETS domain from the highly related Elk-1 protein has a much more stringent requirement for an AG sequence 3 and a CC sequence 5 to the GGA core even though the residues

This table was adapted from Table 3 of Shore and Sharrocks (1995). The GGA core sequence is boxed, and the sequences are numbered according to the convention used in Figure 2A. Highly preferred bases are indicated in upper case letters, and less preferred bases are indicated in lower case letters. Data from published studies are summarized from: SAP-1 and Elk-1 (Shore and Sharrocks, 1995); GABP , ER81, and ER71 (Brown and McKnight, 1992); PU.1 (RayGallet et al., 1995); Ets-1 (Nye et al., 1992); E74 (Urness and Thummel, 1990); Fli-1 (Mao et al., 1994); and PEA3 (Brown et al., 1998).

that contact these base pairs are conserved between the SAP-1 and Elk-1 proteins. This suggests that nonconserved residues outside those that contact these base pairs may have an indirect effect on DNA binding specificity by SAP-1 and Elk-1. This is consistent with the finding that a double mutation of residues away from the DNA contact surface (aspartic acid residues 37 and 68 in Elk-1 to the corresponding residues of SAP-1, Gln37 and Val-68) confers SAP-1 binding specificity to Elk-1 (Shore et al., 1996). Implications for DNA Binding Specificity by ETS Domain Proteins Conserved DNA Contacts between Ets Proteins The SAP-1/DNA complexes highlight several features that appear to be conserved in the structures of other ETS domain/DNA complexes. Comparison with the Ets-1/ DNA (Werner et al., 1995, 1996, 1997), PU.1/DNA (Kodandapani et al., 1996), and GABP / /DNA (Batchelor et al., 1998) complexes reveals that a set of conserved residues serves to mediate the interactions of the 3turn- 4 wing and the 2-loop region with the DNA strands that flank the central GGA core recognized by all ETS proteins. Specifically, residues corresponding to Trp-45, Lys-49, and Lys-51 of the wing make conserved interactions 5 to the GGA core; residues corresponding to Lys-74, Lys-79, and Tyr-82 make conserved interactions 3 to the GGA core (Figure 1C). In addition, highly conserved tyrosine residues at positions 66 and 67 of the 3 recognition helix at SAP-1 make phosphate contacts to bases 3 and 5 of the GGA core in all but the PU.1 complex (PU.1 has an uncharacteristic glycine corresponding to Tyr-67 in SAP-1). Together, the phosphate contacts made by the 3-turn- 4 wing, 2-loop, and 3 recognition helix promote an overall bending of the ETS DNA targets by approximately 10 to 20 , thereby facilitating the insertion of the 3 helix into the major groove for extensive interaction with the functional groups of the base pairs.

The 3 recognition helix also makes a network of conserved interactions with the GGA core sequence (Kodandapani et al., 1996, 1998; Werner et al., 1997; Batchelor et al., 1998), although the PU.1 protein (the most divergent member of the Ets family) shows some subtle deviations (Figure 3). Residues corresponding to Arg-61 and Arg-64 in SAP-1 are strictly conserved in Ets proteins, and the structures of the SAP-1, ETS-1, GABP / , and PU.1 complexes show that these residues function to specify the 1 and 2 positions of the GGA core via direct hydrogen bonds. These arginines also contribute to specificity of the adenine of the GGA core by forming a van der Waals contact to its basepaired thymine. Interestingly, although DNA site selection studies with the PU.1 protein show a strict preference for a guanine at position 1 of the GGA core (Ray-Gallet et al., 1995), some natural PU.1 sites have an adenine at this position. Comparison of the PU.1 complex with the SAP-1 and GABP complexes shows that PU.1 only makes one hydrogen bond to this guanine while the corresponding arginine in the other structures make two hydrogen bonds. This suggests that a guanine-to-adenine substitution at position 1 of the GGA core may be tolerated more easily by the PU.1 protein. Most Ets proteins contain an arginine, lysine, and tyrosine at positions corresponding to residues 61, 58, and 65 of SAP-1, respectively (Pio et al., 1996). Comparisons with all the available ETS domain/DNA crystal structures show that these residues contribute to specify position 3 of the GGA core sequence (Kodandapani et al., 1996, 1998; Werner et al., 1997; Batchelor et al., 1998) (Figure 3). Arg-61, which plays a major role in specifying G 2, also uses its aliphatic side chain to specify position 3 via van der Waals interactions. In addition to making a phosphate contact to the DNA backbone, a highly conserved lysine at position 58 of SAP-1 also uses its aliphatic side chain to make van der Waals interactions with T 3 . In all but the PU.1 complex, the hydroxyl of the residue corresponding to tyrosine 65 of SAP-1 hydrogen bonds to A 3. In the case of PU.1, the residue corresponding to this tyrosine is an asparagine, which is too short to contact this adenine. Nonconserved DNA Contacts within Ets Proteins Table 2 shows that most Ets proteins prefer an adenine at position 4 just 3 to the GGA core sequence, although a thymine is sometimes found in some Ets target sites (Urness and Thummel, 1990; Brown and McKnight, 1992; Fisher et al., 1992; Nye et al., 1992; Mao et al., 1994; Ray-Gallet et al., 1995; Brown et al., 1998). Comparison of structures that recognize an A-T base pair at position 4 (SAP-1/E74DNA, PU.1/DNA, and GABP/DNA) shows that residues 62 and 65 (SAP-1 numbering) specify this base pair (Figure 3). Position 65, a tyrosine in most Ets proteins, hydrogen bonds to A 4 and makes a van der Waals contact to T 4 . PU.1 has an asparagine at the corresponding position, which instead makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond to T 4 . In all the structures that have an A-T at this position, Ala-62 also makes a van der Waals interaction with T 4 . The structure of the SAP-1/c-fos DNA complex has a T-A base pair at position 4. This structure shows that Tyr-65 makes a slight adjustment to make a water-mediated contact to

Molecular Cell 208

T 4, and a direct hydrogen bond to A 4 . In this case, the van der Waals interaction mediated by Ala-62 is lost. The importance of residue Ala-62 in determining the DNA binding specificity for position 4 of the DNA is supported by a recent DNA binding study of the zebrafish PEA3 subfamily of Ets proteins (Brown et al., 1998). DNA site selection with zebrafish PEA3 and human ERM shows that although an A is preferred at position 4, 20%­30% of the selected sites have a T at this position. Interestingly, the PEA3 subfamily of Ets proteins has a serine at the position corresponding to Ala-62 in the SAP-1 protein. Modeling studies show that a serine at this position would be in position to make a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the N7 of adenine at position 4 of the DNA. Another natural variation at position 62 is a glycine. Interestingly, the Ets proteins ETS-1, ER71, and ER81, which have a glycine at this position, select both an A-T and T-A base pair at position 4 with nearly equal preference (Brown and McKnight, 1992; Nye et al., 1992) (Table 2). Presumably, a glycine residue at position 62 of the protein would not be in position to discriminate between an adenine or thymine at position 4 of the DNA. DNA binding site selections studies with Ets proteins show that most Ets proteins prefer a guanine at position 5 located 2 base pairs 3 to the GGA core sequence (Urness and Thummel, 1990; Brown and McKnight, 1992; Fisher et al., 1992; Nye et al., 1992; Mao et al., 1994; Ray-Gallet et al., 1995; Brown et al., 1998) (Table 2). An adenine at this position is also tolerated by most Ets proteins but to a lesser extent than a guanine. The structures of the SAP-1/DNA complexes show that this base pair is specified by the Tyr-65 ring, which makes van der Waals interactions with the cytosine of base pair 5. Consistent with the site selection studies, modeling studies show that an A-T base pair can also be tolerated at this position as the 5-methyl group of the thymine could fulfill a van der Waals interaction similar to the replaced cytosine base. Interestingly, binding site selection studies with the Spi-1/PU.1 and Spi-B proteins show that although a guanine is preferred at position 5, a cytosine is selected nearly one-third of the time (RayGallet et al., 1995). Correlating well with this anomaly, the PU.1/Spi-1 and Spi-B proteins have an asparagine in place of a tyrosine corresponding to position 65 of SAP-1. Presumably, the absence of a tyrosine at this position relieves the requirement for a hydrophobic group at position 5 of a thymine or cytosine base. Modeling studies suggest that a C-G base pair at position 5 may accommodate compensatory water-mediated interactions of the asparagine residue with either the guanine or cytosine base at position 5 of the DNA target. Comparison of the SAP-1/DNA complexes with the DNA complexes with GABP / (Batchelor et al., 1998) and PU.1 (Kodandapani et al., 1996) shows that a nonconserved residue corresponding to position 57 in SAP-1 sometimes contributes to the specificity for position 1 just 5 to the GGA core DNA sequence (Figure 3). In the SAP-1/E74DNA complex, Asp-57 makes a watermediated contact to C 1. This contact is lost in the SAP-1/c-fosDNA complex, which has an adenine at this position correlating well with the reduced overall affinity of SAP-1 for the c-fos over the E74 DNA site and with

the strict preference of a cytosine base at this position in site selection studies (Shore and Sharrocks, 1995b). The corresponding residue in PU.1 is a glutamine, and it makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond to a guanine at the corresponding position of the DNA. Interestingly, both GABP and Ets-1 have a glutamic acid residue in this position, which is disordered in both DNA complexes even though a cytosine base is located at position 1 of their respective DNA targets. This suggests that the glutamic acid residue does not play a role in specificity for C 1 in these Ets proteins, possibly due to the inability of the longer glutamic acid side chain to make water-mediated contacts to C 1. This correlates well with binding site selection studies that show that, in contrast to SAP-1 and its highly related Elk-1 homolog, both GABP and Ets-1 also select DNA sites that contain an adenine at position 1 (Brown and McKnight, 1992; Fisher et al., 1992; Nye et al., 1992; Woods et al., 1992; Shore and Sharrocks, 1995b). None of the available ETS domain/DNA complexes show base-specific interactions with position 2, two nucleotides 5 to the GGA core sequence. Yet in some Ets proteins such as SAP-1, Elk-1, and Fli-1, a cytosine at position 2 is strictly selected in DNA site selection studies (Mao et al., 1994; Shore and Sharrocks, 1995b) (Table 2). Interestingly, in all these cases a cytosine at position 1 just 5 to the GGA core is also strictly selected (Mao et al., 1994; Shore and Sharrocks, 1995b). In contrast, Ets proteins that do not exhibit a strict selection for a cytosine at position 2 also do not have a strict preference for a cytosine at position 1. Taken together, these findings suggest that the SAP-1, Elk-1, and Fli-1 proteins may be recognizing an unusual DNA conformational characteristic of the sequence CCGG selected for positions 2 to 2 of their respective DNA targets. Consistent with this hypothesis, the DNA in the SAP-1 complexes shows properties of A-form DNA (or Beg-form as characterized by Pabo and coworkers [Nekludova and Pabo, 1994]) (Table 1). This is consistent with the observation that CCGG sequences have a high propensity to adopt A-form DNA structure (Berman et al., 1992; Dickerson, 1992; Wahl and Sundaralingam, 1997). Presumably, substitutions of either C 1 or C 2 destabilize the A-type properties of the DNA required to facilitate the interactions made between the SAP-1 3 recognition helix with the DNA major groove. Correlating well with the importance of the unusual structural properties of the CCGG sequence in the SAP-1/E74DNA complex, the DNA in complex with GABP / (Batchelor et al., 1998) harbors the same CCGG sequence and shows similar A-form DNA parameters. This is in contrast to the DNA in complex with PU.1 (Kodandapani et al., 1996), which has a GGGG sequence (not often found in A-form DNA structures) in the corresponding region of the DNA and thus shows significantly reduced A-form properties (Table 1). These correlations suggest that that the A-form DNA properties of the CCGG sequence in the E74DNA (and also the CAGG sequence found in the c-fosDNA) play a role in DNA recognition by some Ets proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that Ets proteins use a set of conserved residues to recognize a GGA core DNA sequence, while sequence discrimination is achieved by specificity for DNA sequences that flank this

Figure 4. Model of the SAP-1 ETS Domain/SRF/SRE Ternary Complex (A) Overall view of the ternary complex. The model was prepared by combining the crystal coordinates of the SRF/DNA (Pellegrini et al., 1995) and SAP-1/c-fosDNA complexes. The SRF/DNA coordinates were transformed onto the SAP-1/DNA complex by superimposing the phosphate and C1 atoms of the four overlapping base pairs in the two structures. The SAP-1/c-fosDNA complex is shown in blue and the SRF/DNA complex in red. The putative binding site for the B box in SAP-1 is connected to the C terminus of the SAP-1 ETS domain by a dotted line. (B) A close-up view of the recognition helices of the SAP-1 and SRF proteins in the DNA major groove. The side chains of the residues that are in position to mediate contacts between SAP-1 and SRF are highlighted in green.

core. DNA contacts from conserved and nonconserved protein residues coupled with sequence-dependent DNA structural properties appear to contribute to this specificity. In some cases, further specificity is achieved by the cooperative binding of heteromeric protein partners. Heteromeric Protein Complexes with ETS Domain Proteins SAP-1, SAP-2, and Elk-1 are members of the ternary complex factors (TCFs) that cooperate with the serum response factor (SRF) protein to bind to the serum response element (SRE) at the c-fos promoter (Treisman, 1994). Studies have shown that a 20-residue B box located about 30­40 residues C-terminal to the Ets domain in TCFs is necessary and sufficient to mediate DNAindependent interactions between SRF and TCF (Shore and Sharrocks, 1994; Ling et al., 1997). However, since the binding sites for the TCFs and SRF are adjacent, it is feasible that SRF may interact directly with the ETS domain of the TCF when both are bound to DNA. To investigate whether or not it is possible for the SAP-1 ETS domain to contact SRF when both are bound to DNA at the c-fos SRE, we modeled the SAP-1/SRF/ SRE ternary complex using the crystal coordinates of the SRF/DNA (Pellegrini et al., 1995) and SAP-1/cfosDNA complexes. The SRF/DNA coordinates were transformed onto the SAP-1/DNA complex by superimposing the phosphate and C1 atoms of the four overlapping base pairs in the two structures. Upon superposition, the two DNA bases overlap well with the backbone showing the same overall DNA curvature (Figure 4A). In the model, the two DNA-binding domains bind to opposite sides of the DNA major groove, positioning the C terminus of the SAP-1 ETS domain and the region of SRF that is proposed to interact with the B box of SAP-1 ° more than 45 A apart. Modeling studies show that the

linker region between the ETS domain and the B box in SAP-1 would be long enough to accommodate this distance. Interestingly, the SAP-1/SRF/SRE model also shows that the C-terminal region of the 3 recognition helix of the SAP-1 ETS domain is in position to interact with the N terminus of helix I of an SRF subunit in the DNA major grove (Figure 4B). Specifically, residue Val68 is in position to make van der Waals contacts to Leu155 of SRF. Asn-153 of SRF is also in close proximity to Val-68 of SAP-1. The proposed interaction between SRF and the C-terminal region of the 3 recognition helix of SAP-1 may directly affect the interactions that the SAP-1 ETS domain makes with DNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, an aspartic acid to valine mutation at position 68 of the Elk-1 Ets protein (SAP-1 numbering) confers SAP-1 DNA binding properties onto Elk-1 (Shore et al., 1996). Together, these results show that perturbation of a residue away from the DNA binding surface of the SAP-1 ETS domain may have a direct effect on ETS domain­ DNA recognition. The structure of the ETS domain of GABP in ternary complex with GABP and DNA shows that GABP uses a helix C-terminal to the ETS domain and another helix C-terminal to the 3-turn- 4 wing of the ETS domain to contact GABP . Comparison with our SAP-1/SRF/SRE model suggests that Ets proteins will use different mechanisms to contact their respective heteromeric protein complexes for transcriptional activation.

cloned DNA sequence (Wistar Institute DNA Core Facility), the expression plasmid encoding SAP-1(1­93) was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/LysS for protein overexpression. Large-scale protein production was carried out in 6 liters of luria broth by growing SAP-1(1­93)-transformed BL21(DE3)/LysS cells at 37 C to an OD595 of approximately 0.6 and then inducing with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1thio-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for about 3 hr. The collected cells were lysed by sonication in a low-salt buffer (LSB) containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The supernatant was isolated by centrifugation, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 1 M. Ten percent (v/v) (pH 7.5) polyethyleneimine (PEI) was added dropwise to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v). The recovered supernatant was dialyzed into LSB before further purification to homogeneity by a combination of cation exchange (SP-sepharose, Pharmacia) and gel filtration (Superdex-75, Pharmacia) chromatography in LSB. Peak fractions from the gel filtration column were pooled and concentrated to 50 mg/ml using a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon). Protein aliquots were stored at 20 C prior to crystallization. Protein purity was estimated to be greater than 95% as judged by SDS gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining. Crystallization and Data Collection Oligonucleotides and related iodinated derivatives were synthesized at the Wistar Institute DNA synthesis facility and the University of Pennsylvania's Cancer Center DNA synthesis facility (University of Pennsylvania, Department of Chemistry). DNA strands were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Dynamax 300 column (Rainin) (Aggarwal, 1990), concentrated by lypilization, and complementary strands annealed in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl. Crystals of SAP-1 (1­93) bound to DNA were prepared by vapor diffusion at 20 C, using 3 l hanging drops containing 0.2 mM protein and 0.25 mM duplex DNA. For the SAP-1(1­93)/E74DNA complex, the hanging drop also contained 25 mM Na cacodylate (pH 6.0), 2.5% PEG8000, and 10 mM zinc acetate, and the drop was incubated over a 1 ml reservoir containing two times the concentration of salts, buffer, and precipitate. For the SAP-1(1­93)/c-fosDNA complex, the hanging drop also contained 25 mM Na cacodylate (pH 5.8), 75 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 7.0% PEG8000 and incubated over

a 1 ml reservoir containing two times the concentration of salts, buffer, and precipitate. Both complexes grew at 20 C in several days to a typical size of 0.3 mm 0.2 mm 0.1 mm. Crystal parameters are indicated in Table 3. All crystals were transferred to a harvest solution containing the reservoir components with 1.1 the concentration of precipitating agent and supplemented with 25% glycerol and were frozen in liquid nitrogen­cooled liquid propane prior to data collection. All data were collected at 110 K on either a Siemens X-100A multiwire area detector with CuK radiation from a Rigaku RU-200 generator with Franks mirrors or a MAR image plate detector equipped with a Siemens rotating anode generator with MSC/Yale mirrors. Data obtained from the X-100A detector were processed with XDS and scaled with XSCALE (Kabsch, 1988a, 1988b), and data obtained with the MAR image plate detector were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). Structure Determination and Refinement The structure of the SAP-1(1­93)/E74DNA complex was determined ° by MIR to 3.0 A using phase information from three heavy atom derivatives. Two derivatives were 5-iodo-cytosine in place of cytosine in the DNA, and the third derivative was prepared by soaking the crystals with thimerosal (1 mM 48 hr soak) (Table 3). Heavy atom positions were identified using difference Patterson and difference Fourier techniques using the package PHASES (Furey and Swaminathan, 1997). Phases were calculated and refined with the program MLPHARE (CCP4 program package) (Dodson et al., 1997). Solvent flattening with the program DM (Dodson et al., 1997) improved the MIR map and permitted tracing of the DNA with the program O (Jones et al., 1991). Conventional positional refinement was carried out against native data set 1 (Table 3) with the program X-PLOR ¨ (Brunger, 1992a) (with 10% of the data omitted as a free data set for cross-validation of the refinement (Brunger, 1992b)) and followed ¨ by phase combination with MIR phases employing the program SIGMAA (Dodson et al., 1997). An alanized PU.1 model was used as a guide to build the SAP-1 protein. Successive rounds of model building, positional refinement, and phase combination were carried out until the entire structure was built. Iterative model adjustments with the program O and positional refinement with the program X-PLOR were continued stepwise at

° ° ° successively higher resolution bins of 3.0 A , 2.7 A , 2.5 A, and 2.3 ° A. Model building was carried out against sigmaA-weighted 2Fo Fc, Fo F c maps and was facilitated by the program OOPS (Kleywegt ° and Jones, 1996a). Refinement beyond 2.7 A resolution employed simulated annealing (Bru nger and Krukowski, 1990) and torsion ¨ angle dynamics (Rice and Brunger, 1994) refinement protocols in ¨ ° X-PLOR (Bru nger, 1992a). At 2.3 A resolution, refinement was contin¨ ° ued against native data set 2 (Table 3) and extended to 1.93 A. A bulk solvent correction was applied (employing low-resolution data) (Jiang and Brunger, 1994), and tightly restrained B factors were ¨ ° refined beyond 2.3 A resolution. Water molecules were added step° wise when the refinement extended beyond 2.1 A resolution. The final model was checked for errors with simulated annealing omit ° ¨ maps (Brunger et al., 1987) and finally refined to 1.93 A with an R-free of 27.7% and an R-working of 22.0% (Table 3). The model contains the entire protein, DNA, 161 water molecules, and two ordered zinc ions and has excellent geometry with no residue outside the allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot (Kleywegt and Jones, 1996b) (Table 3). The SAP-1(1­93)/c-fosDNA complex was solved by molecular re° placement to 3.0 A using the program AMORE (Navaza, 1994) using the SAP-1(1­93)/E74DNA complex (with the altered base pairs appropriately modified) as the search structure. The structure was refined with rigid body and positional protocols with the program X-PLOR. Iterative model adjustments with the program O and refinement with the program X-PLOR were continued stepwise at successively ° ° ° ° ° higher resolution bins of 3.0 A , 2.7 A, 2.5 A, 2.3 A , and 2.0 A . Simulated annealing omit maps were computed at the end of the refinement to check for model errors. The final model was refined to 2.01 ° A resolution with an R-free of 28.6% and R-working of 22.2% (Table 3). The model contains the entire protein, DNA, and 137 water molecules and has excellent geometry with no residue outside the allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot (Table 3).
