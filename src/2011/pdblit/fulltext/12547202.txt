Summary
E. coli aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) is a large (310 kDa~ protein that undergoes major changes in quaternary structure when substrates and regulatory nucleotides bind. We have used analytical gel chromatography to detect quaternary structure changes in both the holoenzyme and its catalytic subunit (c3), to characterize the quaternary structure of single site mutant proteins and to monitor urea-induced dissociation and unfolding of c 3. Binding of the bisubstrate analog PALA (N-(phosponacetyi)-L-aspartate) to ATCase and c3 has been shown to alter s20,w by - 3 . 3 ~ and + 1.4~, respectively [Howlett, G.J. and Schachman, H.K. (1977), Biochemistry 23, 5077-5083]. The corresponding changes in the chromatographic partition coefficient (o) are - 2.6 + 0.3~ and 5.5 + i.9r~ on Sephacryl S400HR and $200, respectively. Partition coefficients of mutant ATCases with single site mutations in the c chain differ from those of the wild-type protein by + 0.Sff, in small zone experiments; for example, mutations Arg 269-~ Gly and Glu 239 ~ Gin alter the partition coefficient by 0.4'~ and -0.5~, respectively. The partition coefficient of mutant Glu 50 --* Gin is identical to the wild type enzyme. In the presence of saturating PALA, partition coefficients of Glu 50 ~ Gin and Arg 269 --. Giy, but not Glu 239--* Gin are identical to those of the wild type. Results for Glu 239 ~ Gin are consistent with measurements of activity, small angle X-ray scattering and sedimentation coefficient that indicate that mutations at this site shift the quaternary structure towards the R state [Ladjimi and Kantrowitz (1988), Biochemistry 27, 276-83; Vachette and Herr6, cited by Kantrowitz and Lipscomb (1988), Science 241, 669-674; Newell and Schachman (1988), FASEB J. 2, A551]. Results for Glu 50---* Gin are also consistent with measurements of activity (Ladjimi et al. (1988), Biochemistry 27, 268-276). The changes in tertiary and quaternary structure that result from urea-induced denaturation of c3 result in larger changes in the partition coefficient. Dissociation into folded monomers in 1-1.75 M urea is accompanied by a 4.65 increase in partition coefficient, while denaturation at > 5 M urea gives rise to a 43ff, decrease

Introduction

Because conformational changes in proteins are critical to their function, there is a need for simple and direct methods to detect and analyze them in solution. Although hydrodynamic and spectroscopic methods are powerful and widely used, ~'~e instrumentation is sophisticated and expensive. In addition, spectroscopic methods generally detect only local structural changes. In contrast, analytical gel chromatography (AGC) is as sensitive as analytical ultracentrifugation to changes in molecular size and shape, but can be carried out at very modest cost with equipment that is easy to maintain ~,~d operate. The introduction of HPLC methods has dramatically increased the rate at which data can be obtained, although at some sacrifice of precision. AGC has been widely used to study associating systems [for reviews see ref. 1-4] and HPLC-AGC is increasingly being used in protein folding studies [5-9]. The potential of the method for detecting and analyzing conformationai changes of native proteins, although recognized [10,11], has, however, not yet been exploited. We show here that AGC can be used to detect changes in the tertiary and quaternary structure of E. coli aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) that result from iigand binding, single site mutations and changes in solution conditions. [For recent reviews of ATCase, see 12-13.] We also show that this method makes the equilibria 3c *-*c2 + c ~ c3 experimentally accessible at low urea concentrations. ATCase is a large (310,000 Da) protein consisting of six catalytic (c) chains and six regulatory (r) chains, organized as two catalytic trimers (c3) and three regulatory dimers (r 2) [14-16]. The molecular weights of the c and r chains are 33 and 17 kDa, respectively [15]. ATCase can be dissociated into c~ and r 2 subunits; the isolated subunits retain the binding properties of the native protein [14]. The enzyme catalyzes the first committed step in pyrimidine biosynthesis, transfer of a carbamoyl group from carbamoyl phosphate (CP) to L-Asp. Activity is ailosterically regulated by CTP (an inhibitor) and ATP (an activator) [17]. Binding of CP, CTP and ATP produces small but detectable changes in tertiary and quaternary structure [18-22], while binding of analogs of L-Asp (in the presence of CP) or the bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-Asp (PALA) produces a major change in quaternary structure [19-24]. Several ligands induce changes in the state of association of either the native enzyme or its subunits. CTP increases the self-association constant of r chains [25], ATP increases the rate of dissociation of c 3 [26], while PALA decreases the rate of dissociation of c3 [27] and increases its rate of association [28]. Binding of CP + succinate or PALA to ATCase decreases the sedimentation coefficient by -3.3% and -3.5%, respectively [19]; binding of PALA

145

has also been shown to increase the radius of gyration by 2.5 _+ 1.5 ,A [24]. In contrast, binding of CP + succinate and PALA to c3 increases the sedimentation coefficient by + 1.05~ and 1.4%, respectively [21]. Although these conformational changes were first detected in solution, those associated with binding of CP + succinate, PALA and CTP to ATCase have been confirmed and delineated by X-ray crystallography [29-31]. Both CP + succinate and PALA cause a 12 A (12~) expansion along the three-fold axis of the molecule [29,31], while CTP has no detectable effect on the overall shape of the crystalline enzyme [30]. The crystal structures of the protein with CTP and PALA bound are designated the T and R states, respectively.

Methods

Reagents PALA was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. Purity was determined by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy [32] and verified by 3tp NMR, using an inorganic p h o s p h a t e s t a n d a r d . N e o h y d r i n 1-[3-(chloromercuri-2methoxypropyl)urea] was purchased from I.C.N.-K. and K. Laboratories and twice recrystallized from 95~ ethanol. Ultrapure urea was obtained from Schwarz/Mann Biotech Division of I.C.N. Biomedicals, Inc. Rabbit muscle aldolase, bovine liver catalase, horse spleen ferritin and bovine thyroid thyroglobulin for column calibration were obtained from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (gel filtration calibration kit). All other calibration proteins were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. c~ was prepared either from the derepressed, diploid E. coli strain developed by Gerhart and Holoubek [33] as previously described [34-35] or from the transformed overproducing strain EKl104/pEK17 developed by Nowlan and Kantrowitz [36] and kindly provided by Dr. E.R. Kantrowitz [Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA] by a method that will be described elsewhere. There were no detectable differences in the proteins prepared by the two methods. Wild type and mutant c6r6 were purified from the E. cog strain EKl104 transformed with the appropriate plasmid. Cells were disrupted in 0.1 M Tris-HCI, pH 9.2 by sonication. Protein was precipitated by addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 to 70~ saturation; dissolved in 0.04 M K21-1PO4-KH2PO4, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 7; treated with RNase A and DNase I; precipitated by dialysis against 0.01 M KH2PO4-K2HPO4, pH 5.9 in the presence of 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA; redissolved and passed over a 2.8 x 30 cm. DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column equilibrated with 0.01 M imidazole-HCl, 0.35 M KCI, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7. Purity was assessed by nondenaturing PAGE [37] and by pH activity assays at pH 8.3 and was comparable to previous preparations. Protein was stored as a precipitate in 3.6 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M Tris-HCI, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, pH 8.3 at 4°C and equilibrated with the experimental buffer

146

by passage over a 0.5 x 8 cm Bio-Gel P-4, 100-200 mesh or Sephadex G-50 desalting column. Holoenzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically assuming an extinction coefficient of 0.59 cm- ~ - (mg- ml- ~)- ~ [38]. Concentrations of c 3 were determined either spectrophotometrically assuming an extinction coefficient of 0.72 cm -1 -(rag-ml-1) -1 [38] or, in the presence of high concentrations of flmercaptoethanol, with the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical Co.) as the standard.

Chromatography
Flow rate was controlled by a Rainin Rabbit peristaltic pump acting as a brake on the eluant from the column; temperature by the flow of water from a circulating water bath through a water jacket [4]. The eluant was monitored by a fluorometer (Gilson Spectroglo, fitted with OPA filters), ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Varian Techtron 635) or column monitor (LKB Model 2138 Uvicord S Filter Detector or Gilson Holochrome) with a strip-chart recorder attached [4]. Flow rates were 6-11 ml. h - l ; temperatures were 7.5 °C in experiments with c3 and either 5 °C or 25 ° C in experiments with ATCase. Flow rates for small zone experiments were determined at least daily by collecting eluant from the column in a graduated cylinder for 30-60 min and determining the volume. In large zone experiments, removal of the reservoir during loading of the sample was found to change the flow rate by -±0.05 ml. h-!. Accordingly, flow rates were determined in each large zone experiment while the sample was entering the column and while it was eluting. Typically, eluant was collected for 2 h during the 2-3 h load and for 3-7 h during elution. Water-jacketed columns (1.5 x 50 cm) were purchased from Bio-Rad. Resins were Sephacryl $200-400 and S-400HR (Pharmacia L.K.B. Biotechnology Inc.), equilibrated with the appropriate buffer, degassed and brought to the experimental temperature before the column was poured. Sephacryl was chosen because of its stability, particularly in urea, and its relative linear reponse to the Stokes radius [39]. S.400 and S-400HR were used in experiments with ATCase: S-200 and S-300 in experiments with c 3. Columns were packed either at their natural flow rate or, when extreme precision was required, at a flow rate of 70-240 m l - h - t maintained with a peristaltic pump, in order to produce an extremely stable gel bed. Columns for small zone experiments were fitted with a Biorad flow adapter attached to a teflon three-way or Rheodyne injector valve so that samples could be loaded without removing the column head. Loading sample by injection increases the reproducibility of measurements. For the urea denaturation experiments, the buffer with which the resin was equilibrated for pouring the column was made 5 M in urea and the bed volume was fixed with the flow adapter to prevent changes in bed volume as the urea concentration was changed. All column buffers were filtered through Nylon-66 0.2 ~tm filters (Rainin Instrument Co.) and degassed at room temperature before use. When the composition of the column buffer was changed, the column was equilibrated with the new buffer for at least three column volumes or until a stable baseline was achieved. Sample volumes were 0.5 ml for small zone experiments and 18 ml for large zone

experiments. Glycine (10/tM) and blue dextran (average molecular weight: 2 x 106 Da; 1 rag- ml-~), both purchased from Sigma Chemical Co, were used for column calibration in the experiments with c3. Glycine was detected by fluorescence, after conjugation with o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) (see below): blue dextran was detected by visible absorbance at 620 nan. The S-400 and S-400HR columns used in the experiments with ATCase were calibrated either with dextran (average molecular weight 5-40 × 106 Da; Sigma Chemical Co.: 0.6 mg. ml - j ) or tobacco mosaic s~rus (Rs: 60 rim; 25/tg- ml -a) and tyrosine (0.17 mM). All markers were detected at 280 nm. Tyrosine was used simply to eliminate the need for fluorescence detection. Control experiments indicated that markers did not alter the elution volume of the protein. When the buffer contained high concentrations of/3-mercaptoethanol ultraviolet absorbance could not be used for detection. Instead, both protein and glycine (the internal volume marker) were post-column derivatized with OPA by pumping a 0.025~ solution of OPA in 0.2 M K+-borate, pH 10.5 through a T-joint into the column eluant at the column flow rate [40]. Derivatization with OPA allows picomolar concentrations of protein to be detected [40], although the concentrations used in these experiments were considerably higher. o, the fractional included volume or partition coefficient, was calculated with the equation: o = (v,- Vo)l(V - Vo)

where V~ is the elution volume of the protein, V is the void volume, determined o with blue dextran, dextran or tobacco mosaic virus, and V~ is the internal volume of the gel, determined with glycine or tyrosine. Elution volumes were calculated from the maximum of the peak in small zone experiments and from the centroid of the leading edge in large zone experiments [1].

Results

The T ~ R quaternary structure change

Binding of PALA is known to produce a major change in the quaternary structure in ATCase [19.22-24.29]. Table 1 shows the values of the partition coefficient obtained with wild type ATCase in small zone experiments in the presence and absence of PALA in two buffers (0.1 M K+-Hepes and 0.04 M NaH2PO4-Na2HPO4) at two pH values (pH 7 and 8.3) and two temperatures (5°C and 25 o C). Under all conditions, the partition coefficient was consistently 1.1-2.0~ smaller in the presence of PALA than in its absence. Calibration of S-400HR columns with standard proteins in 0.04 M KH2PO 4K2HPOo 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.0 at 5 °C indicates that the values of the partition coefficient obtained in large zone experiments under these solution conditions in the presence and absence of PALA correspond to Stokes radii of 60.1 A, and 58.§ A respectively (Fig. l y. These values must be interpreted

cautiously, because of the asymmetry of the molecule [39,41]. They are, however, in good agreement with the value (60 A) previously determined by analytical gel chromatography [39] and in the same range as the dimensions of the crystalline enzyme (65 A along the two-fold axes; 50 A and 56 A along the three-fold axis in the absence and presence of PALA) [42], but larger than the radius of gyration derived by low-angle X-ray scattering under different solution conditions [24]. The difference between them is comparable to that derived by small-angle X-ray scattering [24], but smaller, as expected, than the 12 A change in length of the molecule along the three-fold axis that results, from the T ~ R transition in the crystal [42]. The dependence of the partition coefficient in l~rge zone experiments in 0.04 M K 2HPO4-KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0 on the concentration of PALA is shown in Fig. 2. The partition coefficient decreases with the concentration of PALA up to a molar ratio of PALA" ATCase of approximately 4" 1. This is as expected, since the association constant of PALA is ~pproximately 107 M -~ [43], and, although there are six active sites, the quaternary structure change is complete at a molar ratio of 4 : 1 [19,44]. The maximum value of Ao/o(%) is 2.6%, a value significantly larger than that obtained in small zone experiments.
Quaternary structure changes in c~

Partition coefficients of c 3 derived from small zone experiments in the presence and absence of saturating PALA are listed in Table 1. In contrast to the holoenzyme, but as expected from sedimentation studies [19], PALA increases the partition

Partition coefficients obtained in phosphate buffer in the presence and absence of PALA correspond to Stokes radii of 38.1 A and 39.1 ,~, respectively. Single site mutants Several single site mutants are believed to be in either the T or R state on the basis of substrate affinity, Fm~~ and Hill coefficient [cf. 12, 45-46]. Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of the partition coefficients of two of these mutants, Glu 239 --, Gin and Arg 269 --~ Gly. Glu 239 --~ Oln is located at the interface between c chains in opposite % subunits while Arg 269 --, Gly lies between c chains within a c3 subunit [29,30,42]. Both activity measurements [45] and low angle X-ray scattering (P. Vachette and O. Herv6, cited in [12]) indicate that Olu 239--, OIn is shifted towards the R state. Sedimentation measurements show that this is also the case for Olu 239 ~ Lys [47]. The partition coefficient of mutant Olu 239 ~ Gin falls between those obtained for the wild type enzyme in the presence and absence of PALA over the entire temperature range examined, while those for mutant Arg 269 ~ Oiy are consistently larger. The Stokes radii of wild type, Arg 269 --, Oly and Olu 239 ~ Oln at 5 ° C derived by calibration in Hepes buffer, pH 8.3 are 58.3 ~,, 57.9 ,~ and 59.6 ,~ respectively.

Urea-induced dissociation and unfolding of c3
The dependence of the partition coefficient upon urea concentration in small zone experiments carried out in the presence and absence of PALA is shown in Fig. 4. In the absence of PALA, the partition coefficient remains nearly constant at urea concentrations of 0-1 M, increases in the range 1-1.75 M, then decreases dramatically over the range 2-5.5 M. In the presence of PALA, the partition coefficient decreases gradually up to 5.5 M urea, then drops abruptly to the same value obtained in the absence of PALA.

61 ± 3 A at high urea concentrations, whereas Tanford's empirical equation predicts a value of 60 ± 3 A for a polypeptide of 310 residues in the random coil conformation [49]. Sedimentation velocity experiments have established that c3 does in fact exist as unfolded monomers at high urea concentrations [28]. Further experiments, carried out over a range of protein and urea concentrations on a S-200 column, established that the increase in the partition coefficient at 1-1.75 M urea in the absence of PALA is the result of dissociation of the trimer into folded monomers. Whereas only a single, fairly symmetrical peak was observed with the S-300 columns, the S-200 column partially resolved two peaks (Fig. 5). Calibration with standard proteins indicated that the Stokes radius of the more slowly eluting peak lay between that expected for c and c2. In addition, the relative areas of the two peaks varied with protein and urea concentration in the way expected if c, c 2 and c 3 were in equilibrium, with dissociation being driven by increasing concentrations of urea (Fig. 5). in contrast, the results for PALA shown in Fig. 4 indicate that binding of PALA between chains in c 3 suppresses dissociation so that dissociation of PALA, dissociation of c3 into monomers and unfolding of the chains occur at the same urea concentration. Dissociation and unfolding occur at much higher urea concentrations than in the absence of PALA and are much more cooperative. A more detailed analysis of these data will be published elsewhere.

Discussion

Because AGC resins are known to interact with proteit~s '~he question of whether the changes in partition coefficient obser,'ed here reflect simply changes in the interaction of the protein with the resin rather than changes in molecular size and shape must be considered. Several features of the results argue against this possibility. First, both ATCase and c a fall below the molecular weight calibration curve in phosphate buffer suggesting that neither is adsorbed to the column (data not shown). (In contrast, c a falls above the molecular weight calibration curve in Hepes buffer at pH 8.3, suggesting it is bound by the resin under these conditions.) Second, binding of PALA has opposite effects on the partition coefficients of ATCase and c a, and the magnitudes of the changes vary little with pH, buffer, ionic strength, resin (in the case of c 3) and temperature in the case of ATCase. Third, the signs of these changes in the partition coefficient are those expected from sedimentation velocity experiments; binding of PALA to ATCase results in decreases of 1.1-2.6~ in o and 3.5~ in s20,w [19], while binding of PALA to c a is accompanied by increases in both o (2.5~ in Hepes, 5.5~ in phosphate) and s20,w (1.4~) [19]. Fourth, there is no, consistent trend in the relationship between the partition coefficient and ionic strength for ATCase; the partition coefficient increases with ionic strength in Hepes, but decreases slightly with ionic strength in phosphate buffer. Similarly, there is no consistent relationship between the change in charge induced by a mutation and the corresponding change in the partition coefficient in fifteen mutants examined to date. The changes in the partition coefficient observed with the mutants are also consistent with conclusions drawn from other types of experiments. Interpretation of the urea denaturation data is more straightforward. The results obtained with the S-200 column indicate clearly that the increase in elution volume from the S-300 column in 1-1.75 M urea in the absence of PALA is the result of protein dissociation. Since PALA binds very tightly between chains in c 3, it is not surprising that this ligand suppresses dissociation. Our results at high urea concentrations confirm the conclusion drawn from sedimentation velocity experiments, that ca exists as unfolded monomers under these conditions [28]. AGC has several advantages over more traditional methods in folding studies of multimeric proteins. In contrast to both spectroscopic and calorimetric methods, the experimental parameter, o, provides quantitative information about the size or shape of molecular species. Dissociation is readily distinguished from unfolding, since the effects on the partition coefficient are opposite. Post-column derivatization with OPA allows picomolar concentrations of protein to be detected even in the presence of strongly ultraviolet-absorbing materials. Extrapolation to 0 M allows free energies in the absence of denaturant to be evaluated. In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that AGC is a powerful method for studying quaternary structL~re change, dissociation and unfolding in subunit proteins. They suggest that detectable changes in the quaternary structure of ATCase can be induced by changes in temperature, pH, and buffer, as well as effector binding. The fact that Ao/o for all of the mutants examined Io date is less

154

than aa/a for PALA binding suggests that none of these mutants is completely frozen in the R form, but, instead, exists in intermediate or different conformations. While small zone experiments allow the effects of mutations, ligands and environmental changes to be screened quickly, to realize fully the potential of the method, large-zone experiments are necessary. With the concentration of protein controlled, it will be possible to derive equilibrium constants for both mutant and wild type protein for the dissociation of c3 and possibly r2 processes which have previously been relatively inaccessible. Analyses of boundary shapes will also provide information on the states of association of mutant proteins and perhaps the existence of intermediates in the T ~ R transition. Although HPLC has the potential to allow experiments to be performed more quickly and preliminary experiments indicate that the T ~ R transition is detectable, HPLC results to date have considerably less precision than those obtained by the low pressure method. Even with low pressure methods, constant monitoring of flow rate is critical to success.
