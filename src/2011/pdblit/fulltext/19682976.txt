Eubacteria can import and simultaneously phosphorylate a range of different carbohydrates by means of sugar specific phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) dependent sugar phosphotransferase systems (PTSs). Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the gluconate specific PTS component EIIAgnt from Enterococcus faecalis and its unexpectedly strong complex with EIIBgnt. We analyze the activity of the complex regarding phosphoryl transfer using kinetic measurements and demonstrate by mutagenesis that His-9 of EIIAgnt is essential for this process and represents most likely the phosphoryl group carrier of EIIAgnt. With a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), native gel electrophoresis and chemical crosslinking experiments we show that EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt form a strong 2:2 heterotetrameric complex, which seems to be destabilized upon phosphorylation of EIIBgnt.

Introduction Eubacteria can import and simultaneously phosphorylate carbohydrates such as hexitols mono- and disaccharides by means of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) dependent sugar phosphotransferase systems (PTSs), thereby concentrating a sugar up to 106-fold in the cell [1­4]. The sugar phosphorylation occurs as last and irreversible step of a phosphorylation cascade that transfers a phosphate group from PEP via EI and HPr to the sugar specific EIIsugar components. There, EIIA accepts the phosphate group and passes it on to the hydrophilic domain EIIB which subsequently phosphorylates the sugar during its passage through the corresponding EIIC or EIIC/D membrane channel [1,5­8] (Fig. 1). For an efficient utilization of available carbohydrate sources, PTSs are connected to a number of cellular processes like chemotaxis, carbon catabolite

repression/activation and signaling, including the direct regulation of other import systems as well as the regulation of gene expression via different mechanisms [1,9­13]. The general mechanism of the phosphoryl transfer appears to be similar for the various EIIsugar systems. However, differences are observed regarding the structure and organization of the individual components into single and/or multidomain proteins [1,14]. Thus, the EIIsugar systems are commonly divided into four (super)families (glucose/saccharose, mannitol/fructose, lactose/ chitobiose and mannose) of which at least the EIIA and EIIB components adopt rather different folds [1,2,14,15] and oligomerization states [1]. Among the mannose family of PTS transporters [16] a gluconate specific EII system originating from the low GC content Gram positive bacterium Enterococcus faecalis was found. It consists of an EIIA, -B and -C component as well as a mannose family typical EIID component, all of which are present as separate polypeptide chains. This was also observed for the mannose family Bacillus subtilis levan- and Klebsiella pneumoniae sorbose specific EII components, but not for Escherichia coli EIIman, where EIIA and EIIB are present as single polypeptide chain. Despite the early discovery of the E. faecalis gluconate PTS in 1982 by Bernsmann et al. [17], no further characterization has been performed up to now. In

Fig. 1. Roles of EIIA and EIIB in the gluconate specific PTS from E. faecalis. The EIIC/D complex is shown according to the closely related mannose specific EIIC/D complex from E. coli [30]. Arrowheads are sized differently for clarity only. 1 ­ A phosphate group is transferred from PEP to EI; HPr binds P$EI and becomes in turn His-15 phosphorylated. 2 ­ P$HPr binds EIIA, transfers the phosphoryl group to His-9 and dissociates. 3 ­ P$EIIA forms a complex with EIIB and transfers the phosphoryl group. It is not clarified yet if EIIB is transient (dotted arrows and area with gray background) or constantly associated with the membrane bound EIIC/D complex. 4 ­ The strongly bound EIIA dimer dissociates from EIIB, eventually due to EIIB being phosphorylated and bound to EIIC/D. 5 ­ EIIC imports sugar molecules from the outside of the cell, which are phosphorylated by P$EIIB during the transfer.

particular, it is not clear whether EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt of the E. faecalis gluconate specific PTS (UniProtKB accession codes Q82ZC8 and Q82ZC7) form a stable complex or interact only transiently. Here we report the biochemical analysis of the E. faecalis EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex including its composition, stability and its kinetic properties. Based on the thermodynamic and kinetic data of our study, we can show that both EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt are catalytically active and form an unusually strong complex. Furthermore, we show that His-9 of EIIAgnt is most likely the phosphoryl carrying residue and that the EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex appears to be destabilized upon phosphorylation. Materials and methods Cloning, expression and purification of E. faecalis EIIAgnt H9A and EIIBgnt. The purification of E. faecalis EIIAgnt H9A was performed as described previously for EIIAgnt [18]. In case of EIIBgnt, following the anion exchange chromatography step, protein containing fractions were dialyzed for 3 h in LyB (50 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), MWCO 10,000 kDa), diluted by a factor of three with LyB and applied to a P11 cellulose (Whatman) cation exchange chromatography column equilibrated with LyB. The column was then washed with 17 column volumes of LyB and the

bound protein eluted with a linear NaCl gradient increasing from 0 to 1.0 M NaCl. Afterwards, the purification was continued as described before including concentration, desalting and lyophilization steps. Native PAGE gels. Standard 12% native PAGE gels with a glycine/ Tris buffer system were cast, several micrograms protein loaded as indicated and the electrophoresis performed with 30 mA/120 V at room temperature until the bromphenol band exited the gel. The protein bands were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 for visual inspection [19]. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). For sedimentation and equilibrium centrifugation experiments a Beckmann Optima-XLA Ultracentrifuge was utilized. All measurements were performed at 20 °C and recorded at a wavelength of 280 nm, see Table 1a for further experimental parameters. Equilibrium centrifugation experiments were stopped once the concentration gradient was stable for a minimum of 12 h. In sedimentation centrifugation experiments, data sets were recorded at equidistant time intervals. Analysis of the data was done with the software package BPCFIT [20]. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The protein samples were degassed and equilibrated for 15 min at 25 °C. For the measurement a MCS-ITC calorimeter from Microcal was utilized and

repeatedly 8 ll of a 192-lM EIIAgnt sample added to the 1.4 ml reservoir of 9.5 lM EIIBgnt. All ITC measurements were done in buffer

MSB (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM NaN3, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol). The resulting changes in heating power were recorded, integrated and analyzed with the ``Microcal Origin 4.1 for ITC" software package. Experiments were carried out in duplicate. Kinetic analysis. The phosphorylation reactions were done at 37 °C in buffer MSB containing 2 mM MgCl2, 20 U Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, Sigma), 47 lM NADH (Roche), 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (Roche), 0.14 lM Staphylococcus carnosus EI [21], 0.72 lM E. faecalis HPr [22] and varying amounts of E. faecalis EIIAgnt or 0.72 lM EIIAgnt and E. faecalis EIIBgnt. Conversion of PEP to pyruvate by the PTS system was spectrometrically monitored via the NADH consumption in the coupled LDH catalyzed reaction of pyruvate to lactate. Data was recorded with a Jasco FP-750 fluorescence spectrometer at 470 nm after excitation at 340 nm. The bandwidth for excitation and emission was 5 nm with the

sensitivity set to ``medium". For data processing the software ``Spectra Manager" (Jasco) was used. Results and discussion Formation of the EIIAgnt/EIIBgnt complex To characterize the interaction between EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed using recombinantly expressed proteins. The thermodynamic parameters of the complex formation reaction are summarized in Table 2. For the association constant KA a value of 108 MÀ1 (37 °C) was determined which reflects a strong interaction between the two components and shows that the proteins are almost entirely present as a complex in the equilibrium. This finding is in contrast to the significantly weaker interactions reported for other EIIA:EIIB systems (KD values of 3.7 mM for the mannitol [23], 0.5 mM for the mannose [6] and 14 lM for the galactitol PTS systems from E. coli [24]). Although the reasons for such an unusually strong affinity remain to be elucidated it may be hypothesized, that in systems in which EIIA and EIIB are present on separate polypeptide chains (as, e.g., for the gluconate or the galactitol system) higher affinities are required compared to systems in which EIIA and EIIB are located on a single polypeptide chain. Further analysis of the ITC data (Fig. 2) indicates a 1:1 stoichiometry for the EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex which is in agreement with results obtained by native PAGE experiments where at equimolar

concentrations only the band corresponding to the EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex is observed (Fig. 3A). To clarify the composition of the complex, the oligomerization states of EIIAgnt, EIIBgnt and the complex were investigated by AUC. With equilibrium AUC experiments, molecular masses of 32, 22 and 69 kDa were measured for EIIAgnt, EIIBgnt and the EIIAgnt :EIIBgnt complex, respectively, indicating that EIIAgnt is present as a dimer (Fig. 2), EIIBgnt as a monomer and the complex as a heterotetramer with a 2:2 ratio of EIIAgnt to EIIBgnt (Table 1). All data could be fit with single species models, not suggesting the presence of any other oligomeric states or equilibria. From the AUC data, we further conclude that EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt interact in a high affinity complex, consistent with the high association constant measured by ITC (see above). Additional sedimentation velocity AUC experiments allowed the determination of sedimentation coefficients for EIIA, EIIB and the complex, confirming the oligomeric states observed by equilibrium centrifugation measurements (Table 1 and Fig. 2). To obtain insight into the chemical nature of the protein­protein interactions, the influence of salt concentration on the dimer formation was analyzed with crosslinking experiments using the zero-length linking reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimid (EDC). As expected from the AUC data, the majority of crosslinked EIIAgnt migrates at an apparent molecular mass corresponding to a dimer, while monomeric protein is only indicated by a weak band (Fig. 3B). Increasing amounts of NaCl do not significantly influence the outcome of the EIIAgnt crosslinking

(B) Analysis of the oligomeric state of EIIAgnt, EIIBgnt and the complex by SDS­PAGE and crosslinking of EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt with ECD. While EIIAgnt is apparently present as dimer (compare lane 2 and 3), EIIBgnt migrates corresponding to a monomer after crosslinking with ECD (lanes 4 and 5). EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt together migrate in accordance to a complex (lanes 6 and 7). (C) SDS­PAGE of EIIAgnt which was crosslinked with ECD in the presence of NaCl (as indicated).

experiment (Fig. 3C), leaving the initial ratio of the strong band of the EIIAgnt-dimer and the weaker band of the EIIAgnt-monomer unchanged (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Thus, the interface between the EIIAgnt monomers seems to have a rather non-polar character. For EIIBgnt, the band corresponding to the monomeric state is clearly present and only a faint band corresponding to a dimer is visible (Fig. 3B). This finding is again in good agreement with the data obtained by AUC and indicates that non-specific crosslinking is negligible. Crosslinking experiments with the EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex show a clear band indicating 2:2 heterotetramers and a second band corresponding to heterodimers, probably arising due to incomplete crosslinking of the 2:2 complex (Fig. 3B). Exposure to increasing NaCl concentrations causes the 2:2 heterotetramers to dissociate into EIIBgnt monomers and EIIAgnt dimers (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the EIIAgnt­EIIBgnt interaction appears to be mediated by a polar protein­protein interface. Interestingly, the results obtained by the biochemical analysis are in good agreement with the observation of a closely interacting EIIAgnt dimer in the crystal structure (PDB accession code 3IPR) and underlined by the E. coli mannose PTS EIIAman:EIIBman complex structure showing the same 2:2 stoichiometry [6]. The catalytic activity of the EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex As already described by Bernsmann et al. [17] the entirety of the E. faecalis gluconate PTS components is capable of coupled gluconate import and phosphorylation. However, it remained elusive if

the gluconate PTS system uses P$EIIAgnt and P$EIIBgnt intermediates as described for other PTS systems. Therefore, different reaction mixtures were analyzed by denaturing PAGE performed in tubes. In comparison to reference lanes with pure protein, clear band shifts can be observed for EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt in reaction mixtures containing PEP, EI and HPr, indicating the PTS mediated phosphorylation of EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt (Fig. 4A). For EIIAgnt, the presence of a phosphate group was also shown with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) after incubation with upstream gluconate PTS components (Fig. 4D). To kinetically characterize the phosphotransfer reaction from PEP to EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt, the turnover of PEP to pyruvate was indirectly analyzed by further conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). LDH consumes equimolar amounts of NADPH for this reaction, which was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. For the transfer of phosphate from HPr to EIIAgnt a Michaelis constant Km of 9.8 lM and a catalytic-center activity kcat of 6.4 minÀ1 was determined. For the next phosphotransfer step from EIIAgnt to EIIBgnt, a Km value of 6.5 lM and kcat value of 10.4 minÀ1 were observed (Fig. 2B). While the Km value for the phosphotransfer reaction from HPr to EIIAgnt is about one magnitude larger than described for other PTS systems, the Km value of the phosphotransfer from EIIAgnt to EIIBgnt is in a similar range as for the phosphorylation of PTS sugars by their respective EIIBs [1,14] and the gluconate consumption of whole cell suspensions from E. faecalis [17]. Thus, the kinetic properties of the gluconate PTS seems to conform to other known PTS systems.

The phosphorylation site of EIIAgnt To identify the EIIAgnt residue which accepts the phosphoryl group from P$HPr during the phosphotransfer reaction, mutagenesis experiments were performed. By sequence alignment, His-9 could be identified as candidate residue [18] and was mutated to alanine. The phosphorylation of the wild-type and the EIIAgnt His-9-Ala mutant was analyzed using denaturating capillary gels. As seen in Fig. 4C, the wild-type protein is phosphorylated by the upstream PTS components whereas no phosphorylation of the EIIAgnt His-9-Ala mutant protein is observed. This finding is supported by structural comparison [18], where EIIAgnt His-9 is superimposing well with the phosphoryl carrying residue His-10 of E. coli EIIAman [25,26]. Influence of phosphorylation on the oligomerization state of EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt To estimate the influence of phosphorylation on the stability of the EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex, its oligomeric state was analyzed by native PAGE in the presence or absence of upstream PTS components. While unphosphorylated EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt migrate as a complex, the corresponding band is absent in the presence of EI, HPr and PEP, but different bands indicating monomeric EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). This suggests that phosphorylation of EIIBgnt destabilizes the EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex. Considering the modeled EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex and our mutagenesis experiments, it is reasonable to assume that the phosphoryl group is not accessible in the complex for steric reasons [18]. Consequently, dissociation of EIIAgnt is required to allow the subsequent phosphorylation of the target sugar by EIIBgnt. Destabilization of the complex by phosphorylation of EIIBgnt would therefore promote the continuation of the phosphorylation cascade, especially in light of the strong interaction between EIIAgnt and EIIBgnt. Concluding remarks We have presented here the biochemical analysis of the E. faecalis gluconate PTS component EIIA and of its complex with EIIB. We show that EIIAgnt is active in vitro and demonstrate by mutagenesis and mass spectrometry analysis that His-9 is its phosphoryl carrying residue during these reactions, which is also in perfect agreement with structural data [18]. Analysis of the EIIAgnt­EIIBgnt interaction by ITC, AUC, native PAGE and chemical crosslinking experiments revealed a strong interaction and a 2:2 stoichiometry of the complex. Also considering that both proteins in vivo are most likely present in equimolar amounts due to their gene organization in one operon, our data suggest that the 2:2 EIIAgnt:EIIBgnt complex is of physiological relevance. Furthermore, the observed destabilization of the complex upon phosphorylation of EIIBgnt seems to ensure the rapid accessibility of the phosphoryl group for the subsequent transfer to the target sugar. Compared to the short-lived P$EIIA/EIIB complex of the E. coli chitobiose PTS [27] on the one hand and the covalently linked EIIAman and EIIBman domains of the mannose PTS on the other hand, the stable EIIAgnt: EIIBgnt complex might represent an evolutionary intermediate between a system of transiently interacting, single components and multidomain proteins.
