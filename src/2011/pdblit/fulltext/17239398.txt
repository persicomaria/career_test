Abstract Screening of the genomic libraries of Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC12980 and ATCC7954 for esterase/lipase activity led to the isolation of two positive clones. The results of subclonings and sequence analyses identified two genes, est30 and est55, encoding two different carboxylesterases, and genetic rearrangement in the est55 locus was revealed from genomic comparison. The est30 gene encodes a polypeptide of 248 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 28,338 Da, and the est55 gene encodes a polypeptide of 499 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 54,867 Da. Both enzymes were purified to near homogeneity from recombinant strains of Escherichia coli. The results of enzyme characterization showed that while both enzymes possess optimal activities with short chain acyl derivatives, Est55 has a broader pH tolerance (pH 8 ­ 9) and optimal temperature range (30 ­ 60 jC) than Est30. The activation energy of Est55 (35.7 kJ/ mol) was found to be significantly lower than that of Est30 (101.9 kJ/mol). Both enzymes were stable at 60 jC for more than 2 h; at 70 jC, the half-life for thermal inactivation was 40 and 180 min for Est55 and Est30, respectively. With p-nitrophenyl caproate as the substrate and assayed at 60 jC, Est55 had Km and kcat values of 0.5 AM and 39,758 sÀ1 while Est30 exhibited values of 2.16 AM and 38 sÀ1. Inhibition studies indicated that both Est30 and Est55 were strongly inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and tosyl-L-phenylalanine, consistent with the proposed presence of Ser ­ His ­ Glu catalytic triad of the a/h hydrolase family. The enzymatic properties of Est30 and Est55 reported here warrant the potential applications of these enzymes in biotechnological industries. D 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.3) and lipases (EC 3.1.1.1) are two major classes of a/h-fold hydrolases, which are widely distributed in nature. Their physiological functions have been implicated in carbon source utilization, pathogenicity, and detoxification (Berger et al., 1998; Khalameyzer et al., 1999). While similar in molecular structure and catalytic mechanism, carboxylesterases can be distinguished from lipases by their preference for short chain acyl derivAbbreviations: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SDS, sodium dodecylsulphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacentate; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; IS, insertion sequence; nt., nucleotide; ORF, open reading frame; DTT, dithiothreitol. * Corresponding author.

atives and lack of requirement for interfacial activation. Classification of these enzymes by sequence information in the public databases has been reported by Arpigny and Jaeger (1999). The biochemical properties and their application in biocatalysis of microbial carboxylesterases have been reviewed recently by Bornscheuer (2002). In general, carboxylesterases exhibit high regio- and stereospecificity, require no cofactor in the reaction, and are stable and even active in organic solvents, which make them attractive biocatalysts in the applications of finechemicals synthesis and food processing (Moher et al., 1989; Bornemann et al., 1992; Margolin, 1993). For example, Bacillus subtilis naproxen esterase (Quax and Broekhuizen, 1994) and p-nitrobenzyl carboxylesterase (Zock et al., 1994) have been reported in the production of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory S-isomer of naproxen and hlactam antibiotics, respectively.

In cases where organic solvents or high temperature were used in the production process, the thermophilic enzymes are advantageous over mesophilic enzymes as reflected in the correlation between thermostability and enhanced resistance to denaturants in organic solvents (Guagliardi et al., 1989; Owsu and Cowan, 1989). Thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms represent ideal sources for such enzymes (Morana et al., 2002; Wood et al., 1995). This work describes the isolation and characterization of two thermostable esterases, designated Est55 and Est30, respectively, from a thermophilic Gram-positive bacterium, Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Screening of two genomic libraries from strains ATCC12980 and ATCC7954 led to the identification of two distinct esterases, and nucleotide sequences of the corresponding esterase genes and their flanking regions were determined after subcloning analysis. The encoded esterases were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized with respect to kinetic properties and thermal stability.

2.3. Construction of expression clones The est55 and est30 coding sequences were PCR amplified from pCH1 and pCos4, respectively, using synthetic oligonucleotide primers with the desired restriction sites. The resulting products were cloned into pBAD-HisA (Invitrogen) at NcoI/PstI sites for est55 and NcoI/HindIII sites for est30, and the final plasmids were designated as pHE55 and pHE30. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli Top10 for overexpression of the encoding enzymes. 2.4. Carboxylesterase assay The esterase activity was measured with p-nitrophenyl butyrate or other p-nitrophenyl acylates (Sigma-Aldrich) if otherwise mentioned as substrates (Wood et al., 1995). The reaction mixture (2 ml) contained 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 0.5 mM substrates, and 100 Ag/ml bovine serum albumin. The amount of p-nitrophenol liberated during the reaction was monitored continuously at 405 nm in a Carey 3E spectrophotometer (Varian) with a temperature control module. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 Amol of p-nitrophenol/min at 37 jC. The molar extinction coefficient of p-nitrophenol is 18,380 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 405 nm. The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. 2.5. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (Laemmli, 1970) using 5% stacking gel and 10% resolving gel, and proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. In situ chromogenic assay (Higerd and Riefler, 1976) was carried out on 10 ­15% gradient gels (Pharmacia PhastGel system). 2.6. Enzyme purification For purification of Est55, a culture of E. coli Top 10 harboring pHE55 was induced for 4 h with 1 mM arabinose and cells harvested by centrifugation at 3800Âg for 10 min at 4 jC. The cell pellet was washed once with 40 ml of 10 mM Tris ­HCl buffer (pH 8.0), suspended in the same buffer, and ruptured by three passages through an Aminco French Pressure Cell at 1000 psi. The cell debris was eliminated by centrifugation at 6000Âg for 15 min at 4 jC. The supernatant was heated at 60 jC for 20 min and the precipitated proteins removed by centrifugation at 12,000Âg for 20 min at 4 jC. The clarified supernatant was then loaded on a high-load QSepharose HR 26/10 (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0). The carboxylesterase peak was eluted at 0.35 M KCl. Fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Biomax-30; Millipore) before loaded to Sephacryl S200 (HR26/60)

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids, and media G. stearothermophilus strains (ATCC12980 and ATCC7954) were used for genomic DNA preparations. E. coli XL-1 Blue MR strain (Stratagen) was used as host cell for the cosmid gene library construction and screening for the positive esterase/lipase clone, while DH5a (BRL) was for plasmid propagations and routinely cultured in LuriaBertani (LB) enriched medium (Sambrook et al., 1989) containing ampicillin (100 Ag/ml). E. coli Top10 (Invitrogen) was used for overexpression of both carboxylesterases Est55 and Est30. Sierra medium (Atlas, 1993), containing 15.0 g agar, 10.0 g peptone, 5.0 g NaCl, 0.1 g CaCl2ÁH2O, and 10 ml of Tween 80/l, was used in screening of the EMBL3 phage library for clones carrying esterase genes. Spirit Blue Agar (Difco) containing 30% of lipase reagent (Difco) was used to screen for the positive clones from cosmid and phage libraries. Plasmids SuperCos1 (Stratagen), pUC19 (BRL), and pBAD/HisA (Invitrogen) were used for the purposes of genomic library construction, subcloning, and protein overexpression. 2.2. Construction of genomic libraries Genomic DNA from G. stearothermophilus was prepared with the phenol ­ chloroform extraction method (Sambrook et al., 1989). The cosmid vector SuperCos1 with two k cos sites was used for preparation of genomic library of G. stearothermophilus ATCC7954. The genomic library of G. stearothermophilus ATCC12980 constructed with EMBL-3 phage vector has been reported (Yang et al., 1997). Smallscale preparation of EMBL3 phage DNA was carried out by the standard protocol (Sambrook et al., 1989).

equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.15 M NaCl. Protein was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution volume for Est55 was 70 ml. In the case of Est30, preliminary experiments showed that it was released from the cells upon osmotic shock. Therefore, following induction of E. coli Top10 harboring pHE30, the osmotic shock protocol described by Neu and Heppel (1965) was employed with minor modifications in incubation time to accommodate the large scale treatment of the cells. The cell pellet was suspended in 40 ml hypertonic solution of 20 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2.5 mM EDTA and 20% of sucrose. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing at 10 min intervals. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 13,000Âg for 20 min at 4 jC and the cell pellet was resuspended into the hypotonic solution containing 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.5) and 2.5 mM EDTA, and further incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing at 10 min intervals. After centrifugation at 22,000Âg for 20 min at 4 jC, the cell-free supernatant was collected and Est30 was further purified to almost homogeneity in a similar fashion to Est55. 2.7. Molecular mass determination A gel filtration column (Superdex 200 10/30; Pharmacia) was calibrated with proteins of known molecular masses: ribonuclease A 13.7 kDa, trypsin inhibitor 21 kDa, albumin 67 kDa, aldolase 158 kDa, and catalase 232 kDa. The proteins were eluted by 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.15 M NaCl. The molecular masses were determined from a plot of the elution volume/void volume (Ve/V0) against logarithms of the molecular masses of the standards. 2.8. N-terminal amino acid analysis Proteins from the fraction containing the highest esterase specific activity were applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Problot, Applied Biosystems). The carboxylesterase bands were excised and applied to the Perkin-Elmer Procise Sequencer at the Molecular Biology Core Facility of Georgia State University for the determination of amino terminal sequences. 2.9. Effect of pH and temperature The effect of pH on both Est55 and Est30 activities was investigated in 50 mM citrate ­phosphate (pH range 6 ­ 7), 50 mM Tris ­HCl (pH range 7 ­9), and 50 mM carbonate ­ bicarbonate (pH range 9 ­10.5) buffers in the presence of 20 ng of enzymes and 0.5 mM of p-nitrophenyl butyrate at 37 jC. The effect of temperature on esterase activity was determined by the standard esterase assay in the presence of 20 ng of enzymes. The thermal inactivation was exam-

ined in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at concentrations of 5 Ag/ml of purified enzymes. 2.10. Effect of inhibitors on the esterase activity The effects of the following compounds (SigmaAldrich) were tested for the inhibition effect on the esterase activity: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. An appropriate amount of the enzyme (5 Ag/ml) was incubated with each reagent at 60 jC for 5 min. Relative activity was determined by the carboxylesterase assay as described above using p-nitrophenyl caproate as the substrate. 2.11. DNA sequencing, analyses and accession numbers Plasmid DNA was prepared from overnight cultures of E. coli by affinity columns (Qiagene). The DNA sequences were determined using ABI Big-Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kits (Perkin-Elmer) and ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) in the Molecular Biology Core Facility at Georgia State University. Sequence homology searches were done by the BLAST program (Altschul et al., 1990) against the nucleotide and protein data banks at the National Center of Biotechnology Information of NIH. The sequences of est55 and est30 and their flanking regions have been deposited in the GenBank database (accession nos. AY186196 and AY186197).

3. Results 3.1. Screening of genomic libraries A genomic library of G. stearothermophilus ATCC12980 has been previously constructed (Yang et al., 1997). Phages from this library were plated on Sierra medium for screening of lipase or esterase activity, using E. coli XL-1 blue MR as the host strain. A plaque surrounded by white precipitation, indicating the hydrolysis of Tween 80 and the formation of insoluble calcium salt, was identified. Small-scale lysate of the positive clone was prepared, and the purified DNA was digested with SalI before applied to 1% agarose gel. Three DNA fragments, estimated to be 7.0, 3.0, and 1.0 kb in size, were subcloned into pUC19, and the recombinant plasmids were designated pCH1, pCH2, and pCH3, respectively. These three plasmids were introduced into E. coli DH5a and the transformants were screened on Spirit Blue Agar plates for the lipase or esterase activity. Positive results were observed only with pCH1, carrying the 7.0-kb chromosomal insert. A cosmid genomic library of G. stearothermophilus ATCC7954 was also constructed in this study and screened for lipase or esterase activity on Spirit Blue Agar plates. A positive clone, pCos4, was identified by its deep blue

coloration surrounded by a clear halo. These two clones, pCH1 and pCos4, were subjected to further analyses as described in the following sections. 3.2. Plasmid pCH1 encodes a carboxylesterase, Est55 The nucleotide sequence of the 7.0-kb SalI insert on pCH1 was determined. Sequence analysis found one complete ORF starting with an ATG codon at nt. 3549 and extends to a TAG codon at nt. 5045. This ORF has a coding capacity for a polypeptide of 499 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 54,867 Da. The results of sequence homology search against the protein database indicated that the encoding protein exhibits very high sequence similarity to a variety of carboxylesterases. Therefore, this aforementioned ORF was designated as est55 gene. As described in Materials and Methods, the Est55 protein was purified from a recombinant strain of E. coli, and the determined N-terminal sequence of the first 10 amino acids was M-E-R-T-V-V-E-T-R-Y. These results confirmed the proposed reading frame of est55 from nucleotide sequence analysis, and indicated that the first methionine residue of the purified Est55 protein was not removed by post-translational modification. The genetic content of the chromosomal insert in pCH1 is summarized in Fig. 1. Analysis of the DNA sequence upstream of the est55 revealed the presence of an IS-like element of 1388 bp with high nucleotide sequence similarity to that of a previously characterized transposable element, IS4712, from G. stearothermophilus strain PV72/p6 (Scholz et al., 2000; GenBank accession no. AJ223150). In spite of the high nucleotide sequence identity (98%), this IS-like element does not have a complete open reading frame for a transposase gene as it is the case in IS4712 and other IS -end of the putative elements; the first 187 bp at the 5V reading frame shows no significant homology to that of IS4712, and the remaining part of the reading frame was interrupted several times by the presence of translational termination codons which likely make it a defective IS element.

3.3. Cosmid pCos4 encodes two distinct carboxylesterases, Est55 and Est30 The cosmid clone pCos4 contains a chromosomal insert of 35 kb as estimated by restriction digestion. The possibility of more than one lipase or esterase encoded by pCos4 was investigated. Cell-free extract prepared from E. coli XL-1 blue MR harboring pCos4 was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the presence of lipase or esterase activity was detected using the in situ chromogenic assay as described by Higerd and Riefler (1976). Two bands with estimated molecular masses of 55 and 30 kDa were detected (Fig. 2). These results suggested that pCos4 carries two different lipase or esterase genes. These two encoded enzymes were separated and partially purified from cell-free extracts of E. coli XL-1 blue MR strain harboring pCos4 by application onto a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (Pharmacia).

Da. The amino acid sequence of this ORF was found to be identical to that for a reported 30-kDa carboxylesterase from G. stearothermophilus IFO12550 (Kugimiya et al., 1992); therefore, this ORF was designated as est30. The N-terminal sequence for the derived Est30 was identical to that of the purified 30-kDa esterase as described above, with the first methionine residue being removed by post-translational modification. The nucleotide sequence downstream of est30 contains a truncated ORF with 66% identity to vacB of B. subtilis encoding ribonuclease R. 3.4. Purification of carboxylesterases Both Est55 and Est30 were purified by the protocol described in Section 2.7. Purification of these two enzymes was facilitated by the findings that Est30 can be efficiently released from the whole cells by the osmotic shock procedure, and that Est55 is stable in the crude extract even after heat treatment at 60 jC for 20 min. The purified preparations were judged to be in excess of 95% homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The apparent molecular masses of the two enzymes under non-denaturing conditions were estimated by gel filtration to be 46 and 55 kDa for Est55 and Est30, respectively. These results indicated that the native Est30 is a dimer of identical subunits, while the native Est55 is a monomer. 3.5. Substrate specificity The rates of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acylates with chain length between C2 and C18 were determined for Est55 and Est30. The results (Table 1) show that Est55 has maximal activity toward C4 and C6 with activity decreasing sharply from C8 to C12 and no detectable activity between C14 and C18. In the case of Est30, maximal activity was observed with C6, while activity decreased gradually from C8 to C12, and was undetectable between C14 and C18.

E-T-R-Y, was identical to that of the carboxylesterase Est55 encoded by pCH1. It is different from that of the 30-kDa peptide, M-K-I-V-P-P-K-P-F-F. pCos4 was digested with HindIII and a 3.3-kb fragment was further subcloned into pUC19 in order to construct pCos5. The nucleotide sequence of the chromosomal insert in pCos5 was determined, and the genetic features of this sequence are summarized in Fig. 1. Plasmid pCos5 was found to express the 30-kDa protein but not Est55. Analysis of the determined nucleotide sequence of pCos5 showed the presence of a truncated est55 gene extending from the HindIII cloning site and ending at a TAG stop codon at nt. 532, as evidenced by its complete nucleotide sequence identity to the corresponding sequence of est55 in pCH1. Downstream from est55, an ORF extending from an ATG codon at nt. 1434 and terminating with a TAA codon at nt. 1670 bp was found to exhibit 76% amino acid sequence identity to the YvaL protein of B. subtilis. Sequence analysis also identified the presence of an ORF extending from an ATG triplet at nt. 1743 to a TAA triplet at nt. 2486, which has a coding capacity of 248 amino acids, yielding a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 28,338

Enzyme activity was assayed at 37 jC using 20 ng of enzyme in 2 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 100 Ag/ml bovine serum albumin. Substrate stock solutions (100 mM) were prepared in ethanol, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 Al of substrates into the prewarmed reaction mixture. Release of p-nitrophenol was monitored at 405 nm. The highest activity values of each enzyme were taken as 100%. Activity measurements have been performed in duplicates.

3.6. Effect of temperature and pH The activities of Est55 and Est30 were examined as a function of temperature. The results (Fig. 4A) showed that Est55 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenylhexanoate in a broad temperature range of 20 ­ 70 jC, with the maximal activity at 60 jC. An Arrhenius plot of the data (Fig. 4B) yielded an activation energy of 35.7 kJ/mol. Est30 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenylhexanoate in a temperature range of 40 ­70 jC, with maximal activity at 70 jC. An Arrhenius plot yielded activation energy of 101.9 kJ/mol. The thermal stabilities of both enzymes were determined in a temperature range of 50­ 80 jC. As shown in Fig. 5, both enzymes were stable at 60 jC for more than 2 h. At 70 jC, the half-life for thermal inactivation was 40 and 180 min for Est55 and Est30, respectively. These results indicate that Est30 has significantly a higher thermostability than Est55, particularly at 70 jC. The optimal pH for both enzymes was determined as described in Section 2.9. The results (Fig. 6) show a broad maximal activity for Est55 between pH 8.0 and 9.0 whereas Est30 exhibited sharper optimal activity at pH 9.0.

3.7. Kinetic studies To compare the difference between Est55 and Est30 in catalytic reactions, the kinetic constants of these two enzymes were determined with p-nitrophenyl caproate as the substrate, and the assays were conducted at 60 jC, pH

The activity was measured at various pH values and represented as a percentage of the maximum activity. Filled symbols, Est55; open symbols, Est30.

a Enzyme (5 Ag/ml) was pre-incubated with different inhibitors (1 mM) in the reaction buffer for 5 min at 60 jC before assaying for activity. The enzyme activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl caproate as substrate, and the activity without the addition of reagents were taken as 100%. Activity measurements have been performed in duplicates.

8.5. A Lineweaver ­ Burk plot showed a linear response over the tested concentration range. The Km and kcat values of Est55 were estimated to be 0.5 AM and 39,758 sÀ1, while those of Est30 were 2.16 AM and 38 sÀ1. These results indicate that the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of Est55 is more than 1000-fold higher than that of Est30. 3.8. Inhibition studies The purified Est55 and Est30 were incubated with different reagents at a final concentration of 1 mM for 5 min at 60 jC, and the relative activities were determined using the standard assay with p-nitrophenyl caproate as substrate. The results (Table 2) show that both enzymes are significantly inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid probably due to the covalent interaction with the active site serine residue. Both 2-mecaptoethanol and dithiothreitol activated Est55 and Est30 to a lesser extent. Both enzymes were strongly inhibited by organophosphorous compounds such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride which is typical for serine hydrolases (Amaki et al., 1992; Wood et al., 1995). In addition, both enzymes were inhibited strongly by tosyl-Lphenylaline chloromethyl ketone that presumably interacts with the histidine residue at the active site. On the other hand, the presence of 1 mM EDTA had no effect on both enzymes activity, indicating the lack of essential metal ion that might be required for their activity.

Discussion Several intra- and extracellular carboxylesterases have been fully or partially characterized from various strains of G. stearothermophilus (Amaki et al., 1992; Wood et al., 1995; Kim et al., 1997). This paper describes the cloning of two carboxylesterases using a previously constructed library of G. stearothermophilus strain ATCC12980 (Yang et al., 1997) and a second library constructed in this work from strain ATCC7954. Plasmid pCH1, derived strain ATCC12980, was found to encode a carboxylesterase with a molecular mass of

55 kDa, Est55. Comparison of the derived amino acid sequence of Est55 with those from GenBank database showed that it exhibits 40% identity to the PnbA esterase from B. subtilis (Zock et al., 1994; accession no. B69680) and 41% to an esterase from Bacillus sp. BP-7 (Prim et al., 2001; accession no. CAB93516). Both of these enzymes are members of the bacterial subclass of Type B carboxylesterases. Plasmid pCos4, derived from ATCC7954, encodes an identical Est55 as well as an esterase with a molecular mass of 30 kDa, Est30. This latter enzyme exhibits complete identity to an esterase from G. stearothermophilus IFO12550 (Kugimiya et al., 1992; accession no. Q06174), and 96%, 75%, and 71% identity to esterases from B. thermoleovorans IHI-91 (Markossian et al., 2000; accession no. AAG53982), B. subtilis (accession no. NP391242), and B. halodurans (accession no. NP244421), respectively. Kugimiya et al. (1992) have pointed out that the identical Est30 of strain IFO has the sequence G-X-S-X-G, which is the consensus active sequence of serine esterases and suggested between Gly24 and Phe25 as the probable site for cleavage of the signal sequence for this extracellular enzyme. The results of sequence alignment of both Est55 and Est30 indicated that Est55 belongs to family VII of bacterial lipolytic enzymes according to Arpigny and Jaeger classification (1999), while Est30 could not be classified to any one of these families. However, the results of sequence alignment from BLAST search showed that Est30 possesses a conserved domain designated COG1647 to a number of similar enzymes. Sequence analysis of pCH1 and pCos4 revealed that the gene organization around est55 differs between strains ATCC12980 and ATCC7954 (Fig. 1). While the IS-like element upstream of est55 exists in both strains, gene organization downstream of est55 is completely different between these two strains. The gene organization in the chromosomal insert of pCos4 from ATCC7954 was similar to that deduced from the unfinished sequence of G. stearothermophilus genomic DNA (GenBank). This similarity is demonstrated by the presence of est30, vacB, and yvaL, which is considered to be functionally homologous to secG of E. coli (Wely et al., 1999) downstream from the est55 gene of both strains, but the absence of this organization in strain ATCC12980 (Fig. 2). This could be due to gene arrangement among strains, as suggested by the presence of IS-like element or IS5377 upstream of est55 among these strains (Fig. 1). It was estimated to have six to eight copies of IS-like element in strain ATCC12980 and ATCC7954 by Southern blot analyses (data not shown). Due to the vicinity of est55 and est30 to IS or IS-like elements among these organisms, it is speculative that these genes might be part of a composite transposon. Overexpression of Est30 and Est55 in E. coli permitted successful purification of these two enzymes to near homogeneity. Both purified enzymes showed optimal activities with short chain acyl derivatives as was the case for esterases that were partially characterized from other strains of G. stearothermophilus (Amaki et al., 1992; Wood

et al., 1995; Kim et al., 1997). The results obtained regarding the effect of temperature on activity of Est55 (Fig. 4) showed a broad optimal range of temperature between 40 and 70 jC and an Arrhenius plot of the data yielded a relatively low activation energy of 35.7 kJ/mol. In contrast, Est30 had a much sharper optimal temperature at 70 jC with corresponding higher activation energy of 101.9 kJ/mol (Fig. 4). In addition, the maximal specific activity of Est55 (7128 units/mg; 60 jC) is about 10-fold higher than that of Est30 (751 units/mg; 70 jC). At 60 jC with p-nitrophenyl caproate as the substrate, Est55 has a much higher kcat value than Est30 (39,758 versus 38 sÀ1) even though the Km of Est30 is only about fourfold higher than that of Est55 (2.16 versus 0.5 AM). Thermal inactivation data (Fig. 5) showed that both esterases were relatively stable between 50 and 60 jC with half-lives in excess of 120 min at 60 jC. At higher temperatures, Est30 was more stable than Est55. The thermal stability of Est55 together with its broad and high activity between 30 and 60 jC makes it a good candidate for biotechnological applications. The results of inhibition studies (Table 2) on both enzymes suggested the presence of both serine and histidine residues in their active sites that is typical of serine hydrolases. Based on sequence and structural homology to the PnbA esterase of B. subtilis; (Zock et al., 1994; Spiller et al., 1999), Est55 belongs to the a/h hydrolase family with a catalytic triad formed by Ser-189, His-399, and Glu-310. While Est30 also belongs to a subfamily of a/h hydrolase, 3-D structure of this subfamily was not available. From sequence homology, Ser-94 of Est30 has been postulated as the catalytic active site (Kugimiya et al., 1992). Although Est30 isolated from G. stearothermophilus ATCC7954 in this study was found to be identical with regard to the derived amino acid sequence to the esterase previously identified from strain IFO12550 (Kugimiya et al., 1992), the effects of pH, temperature, and some inhibitor reagents (EDTA and DTT) reported here are quite different from those reported for the enzyme from the IFO strain when produced by a recombinant strain of B. brevis (Amaki et al., 1992). These differences could be due to the structural modification that was introduced to the enzyme by replacing the putative signal sequence of the est30 gene with that of a middle wall protein of B. brevis (Amaki et al., 1992). Crystals of purified Est30 have been generated and sub° jected to X-ray diffraction with a 2 A resolution (Liu et al., 2003). Determination of Est30 molecular structure is expected to locate the catalytic triad of this family and to further understand the differences between the native Est30 and its recombinant derivative.
