Since integration into the host cell genome is an obligatory step for their replication, retro-elements are both potent insertional mutagens and also suitable vectors for gene therapy. Many recent studies reported that the integration process is not random but, on the contrary, higly regulated at the molecular level. Many viral proteins and cellular factors play a key role in the integration step, explaining the reason why different retroelements display distinct integration profiles. This review describes the recent highlights about integration of retro-elements with particular focus on the mechanisms underlying the specificity of integration target-site selection and the step of chromosomal tethering which preceeds insertion of the provirus. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction Integration of the viral genome is a key step of retroviral infection because it ensures both expression of viral genes, and thus production of new progeny viruses, and also stable maintenance of viral genetic information in infected cells. Integration is performed by integrase (IN), a virus-encoded protein produced as part of the Gag­Pol polypeptide precursor, from which it is released following viral protease (PR)-mediated cleavage. Integration is not a random process. Each retrovirus genera displays a distinct and specific pattern of integration, which is regulated by viral and cellular factors as well as by local DNA conformation at the site of integration. The unique property of retroviruses to integrate their genome constitutes a major advantage for retrovirus-based gene therapy, which aims at long-term correction of genetic defects. This therapeutic approach has been successfully employed to treat children suffering from X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. Remission was obtained after re-grafting patients with their own hematopoietic stems cells transduced ex vivo with a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived vector carrying the -chain cytokine

receptor gene [23]. However, because proviral integration near essential cellular genes leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation, leukemia-like disorders arose in some cases [62,63] representing the first description of insertional mutagenesis following a clinical trial [24]. This adverse effect raised not only issues about the safety of these viral vectors, which were already known to cause cancers in their natural hosts, but also brought an old question up to date: what dictates the integration specificity of a retro-element? Since both viral and cellular determinants critically modulated proviral integration, understanding the precise interactions occurring between cellular and viral partners could certainly lead to the elaboration of safer therapeutic vectors, specifically targeting the corrective gene to chosen regions of the host genome, allowing an adequate level of transgene expression without altering cellular gene transcription. Moreover, this will help us to better define the mechanisms allowing long-term persistence of retro-elements into a cellular genome without causing major defects to its host. 2. Early steps of retroviral replication 2.1. Viral entry and reverse transcription Retroviral entry into the target cell is a complex multi-step process which involves specific interactions between the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein and cellular receptor/co-receptor couples, leading to the fusion between viral and cellular membranes (for a review see [106]). Next, the viral core is released into the cytoplasm and the viral reverse

transcriptase (RT), contained within the core, converts the viral RNA genome into a double-stranded linear cDNA form. This reaction usually occurs upon entry into the host cell within a nucleoprotein complex termed the reverse transcription complex (RTC). However, there is evidence for limited cDNA synthesis within viral particles before infection [91,137,159]. Foamy retroviruses (FVs) constitute an exception since their reverse transcription is mainly a late event, taking place after integration. Consistently, the form of FVs genome responsible for a productive infection is the viral particle-associated cDNA [153], although FVs RNA genome seems to play also an important role during the early events of viral replication [45]. Reverse transcription and viral core disassembly are concomitant, tightly coupled processes [155]. The molecular mechanism underlying the RNA-to-DNA conversion is today well defined, while the kinetics of uncoating is still a matter of debate. Earlier studies suggested that incoming viral particles undergo uncoating soon after entry [50]. However, more recent results indicate that it might occur later near the centrosome [79] or the nuclear envelope [2], likely depending on the virus and/or the cell metabolism. In the case of FVs both viral and cellular proteases participate in this process [120]. While reverse transcription proceeds, the RTC undergoes a progressive remodeling to become a pre-integration complex (PIC), which is defined as the viral nucleoprotein complex competent for proviral integration. HIV-1 PICs consist of viral components, such as nucleocapsid (NC), matrix (MA), RT, IN and Vpr protein, as well as several cellular proteins, which are associated with the viral genome [15,50,101]. 2.2. Trafficking and nuclear import The cell cytoplasm is a highly viscous environment, containing organelles and cytoskeletal elements embedded in an extremely dense protein matrix, making passive diffusion of viral particles quite impossible. Viruses have therefore evolved many strategies to hijack cellular machineries to cross the cytoplasm and make their way to and from the nucleus [104,114]. Indeed, several retroviral proteins interact with elements of the cytoskeleton and/or components of the molecular motor complexes. For example, incoming FVs Gag engages the light chain 8 of the minus-end directed microtubule (MT) motor dynein, allowing its accumulation at the centrosome prior to nuclear translocation [111]. Similarly, incoming HIV-1 particles traffic along the MT network from the cell periphery toward the centrosome [99]. For shorter range movements, HIV-1 NC protein has been shown to engage actin [68,88]. The last obstacle to the penetration of the viral genome into the nucleus is the nuclear membrane. PICs from numerous retroviruses are unable to cross this physical barrier when intact. For example, retroviruses such as MLV cannot replicate in interphasic cells and require nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis to gain access to host cell DNA. However, it has been recently suggested that active nuclear import of MLV PICs may occur in differentiated cells [59]. Lentiviruses, such as HIV-1, can productively infect non-dividing cells, since their PICs can be actively imported into the nucleus [14]. Other retroviruses, such as Rous Sarcoma virus (RSV) and FVs, display intermediate dependence on the cell cycle status of the target cell [65,110]. The determinants that allow HIV-1 replication in non-dividing cells have been mapped to the viral IN, MA and Vpr proteins as well as to a cis-acting structure of the viral DNA (named FLAP). These elements have been proposed to contribute to the active nuclear import of HIV-1 PICs, either directly or indirectly. However, the exact role of each of these factors is controversial since recombinant HIV-1 particles lacking one or several of these elements retain significant ability to infect non-dividing cells [38,127]. The HIV-1 IN protein is a particularly attractive candidate to mediate nuclear import of the viral genome. Nuclear translocation of HIV-1 IN is required for productive

infection of both non-dividing and dividing cells [9]. Moreover, IN harbors a non-classical Nuclear Localization Sequence (NLS) which has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to promote nuclear import of PICs [9,54]. However, mutation of its putative NLS does not fully abolish IN nuclear entry [48,86]. More recently, three novels IN partners, the nuclear transport receptor transportin-SR2 (TRN-SR2), importin 7 and the nuclear pore component NUP153, have been proposed to be important players controlling nuclear access of HIV-1 PICs [33,143,154]. Another line of evidence points out that uncoating might be the rate-limiting step that determines nuclear import of the viral genome [82]. In support of this hypothesis, analysis of MLV­HIV-1 chimeras revealed that CA is the essential viral factor that dictates the ability of a retrovirus to replicate in interphasic cells [147]. 2.3. Retroviral integration After entry into the nucleus, the viral genome has to be integrated into the host cell genome to ensure expression of viral information. However, integration is a rare event. Estimations indicate that most viral particles are non infectious, likely due to the fact that a majority of viral genomes are defective [72,113]. Nevertheless, a recent report showed that 1 of every 8 viral particles beginning reverse transcription leads to the formation of a provirus [134]. Cellular restriction factors also contribute to limit the efficiency of viral replication [132]. Consequently, the integrated viral genome represents only 5 to 10% of the total viral DNA content of an infected cell [13]. Both extrachromosomal linear molecules and circular molecules, containing 1 or 2 Long Terminal Repeats (LTR), represent the most abundant forms of the viral DNA genome. The full-length linear cDNA, which is considered the direct precursor of the provirus, decays rapidly if not integrated (estimated half life of 1­2 days) [158], while 1- and 2-LTR circles accumulate in the nucleus at later times of infection. These circular forms, which are considered dead-end products of aborted integration events [12], can also lead to viral gene expression [57,70]. Contribution of unintegrated forms of viral genome to replication is supported also by a recent work demonstrating release of new progeny virions from HIV-1-infected quiescent lymphocytes reactivated in the presence of integrase inhibitors [112]. 3. The retroviral integrase 3.1. Integrase structure and functions Retroviral IN proteins share a similar structural arrangement, being composed of three independent domains (see for a review, [41]). The N-terminal region carries an HHCC motif analogous to a zinc finger, most likely involved in protein multimerization, a key event for IN functions [77,156]. The central region, known as the catalytic core domain, harbours the catalytic active site, encompassing the D,D-35,E motif, and is highly conserved between viral IN and transposases. Consistently, inhibitors targeting Mos-1 transposase are also efficient against HIV-1 IN [8]. All integrase functions strictly require the presence of a metallic cationic co-factor which is coordinated by two residues of the catalytic triad (D64 and D116 for HIV-1 IN) [58,92]. The C-terminal domain displays a non-specific DNA binding activity and is therefore mainly involved in the stability of the complex with nucleic acids. IN exhibits four enzymatic activities (for a review [41]). It catalyzes the 3-processing and strand transfer reactions leading to concerted integration of the viral DNA into the host cell genome. The 3processing reaction, which corresponds to a nucleophilic attack by a water molecule, involves the removal of two nucleotides, adjacent to the highly conserved CA dinucleotide, from the 3 strand of both U3 and U5 viral LTR termini. Mutations within these sequences completely abolish IN-mediated cleavage, whereas the integrity of

209

flanking regions is less critical [1,49]. Next, the cleaved DNA is used as a substrate for strand transfer, resulting in the covalent insertion of the provirus into the cellular genome. This second reaction occurs simultaneously at both ends of the viral cDNA molecule, with a precise offset depending on the retroviral genera (five base pairs in the case of HIV-1), between the two opposite points of insertion [145]. Two others IN enzymatic activities have been reported. The disintegration reaction, which may be considered the reverse of the strand transfer reaction [32], has been observed in vitro. Finally, IN displays an endonucleolytic activity and specifically cleaves the palindromic sequences at the LTR­LTR junction of 2-LTR circles, with kinetics comparable to that of the 3-processing [43]. Cleavage of the LTR­LTR junction by IN has been first observed in the case of FVs [44], but seems to be a general feature of retroviruses. Remarkably, IN recognizes and cleaves specifically the cognate LTR­LTR junction [43,44]. IN-mediated digestion occurs symmetrically on both strands, with a preferred cleavage at the CA dinucleotide (corresponding to the CA sequence used for the 3-processing reaction) and requires the integrity of the catalytic triad. Based on these observations we speculate that IN might use 2-LTR circles as a substrate for concerted integration. However, there is no current experimental evidence that the disintegration reaction and/or IN-mediated cleavage at the LTR­ LTR junction occur in vivo. 3.2. Regulation of IN activities Numerous factors participate to the regulation of IN functions. First, it is well established that the enzymatic properties of IN are tightly linked to its oligomeric state: the 3-processing reaction is efficiently catalyzed by IN dimers [51,61], whereas the concerted integration and the endonucleolytic activity are performed by IN tetramers [43,84]. Second, several cellular proteins such as SNF5/Ini1 or Ku80, which interact with IN and/or are associated to retroviral PICs, critically assist IN-mediated functions [93,95]. Furthermore, the Barrier-toautointegration factor (BAF), a component of HIV-1 and MLV PICs [28,87], stimulates integration thanks to its ability to link DNA and by inhibiting suicidal auto-integration of the viral cDNA genome, at least in vitro [64]. Similarly, Lens Epithelial-Derived Growth Factor (LEDGF/ p75) increases the efficiency of concerted integration (for reviews see [34,139]). Addition of recombinant LEDGF/p75 to an in vitro HIVbased integration assay enhances the strand transfer activity of recombinant IN [30], in a manner that is highly dependent on the ratio between IN and LEDGF/p75 [108]. Moreover LEDGF/p75 is able to stabilize the tetrameric form of IN [100] and by binding to IN, it increases its solubility [31]. Another cellular co-factor of HIV-1 PICs that has been shown to stimulate concerted integration in vitro is HMG I(Y), a protein from the High Mobility group family. HMG I(Y) can condense DNA molecules mimicking HIV-1 LTR extremities in vitro [83]. The proposed mechanism implies that HMG I(Y) adjoins and unwinds the viral LTR termini, facilitating IN binding and promoting the formation of active IN­cDNA complexes [83]. Viral components of PICs also contribute to the efficiency of concerted integration. In particular, the presence of the NC protein results in an enhancement of retroviral integration, probably as a consequence of its link with the viral DNA molecule [19]. Third, IN activities are also dependent on the structure of both viral and host DNA substrates. IN-mediated cleavage at the retroviral LTR termini is highly sequence-specific for the cognate attachment site (att site) [40]. In addition, IN functions are critically influenced by the architecture of the viral cDNA, since alterations in the minor groove affect 3-processing activity to a greater extent than substitutions in the major groove [141]. Intrinsic characteristics of the target DNA structure and its folding into chromosomal arrangements also exert a major influence on integration target-site selection [115]. Analysis of IN propensity to integrate an oligonucleotide mimicking HIV-1 LTR

into either DNA molecules of known structure or previously defined nucleosomal complexes, revealed that the structural features (curvature, flexibility, and rigidity in solution) of the target DNA critically control the site and the frequency of insertion [116]. In particular, distortion of the double helix due to its association with histones promotes the integration reaction. However, when a model of target DNA, comprising a 13-nucleosomes extended array and including binding sites for specific transcription factors, was compacted by addition of histone H1, a reduction of the efficiency of HIV-1 INmediated integration in vitro was observed [131]. In contrast, integration catalyzed by ASV IN was more efficient after compaction. 4. Mechanism of integration site specificity High-throughput sequencing methods have revealed preferences in the integration target-site selection depending on the retrovirus studied [82,96,102,105,126,144]. Although the molecular basis of integration target-site selection specificity is still unclear and a matter of debate in the case of animal retroviruses, much more is known about other retrovirus-like elements, such as yeast retrotransposons. Retrotransposons display structural as well as mechanistic similarities with animal retroviruses. Their genomes are similarly flanked by direct repeats (LTRs), encode Gag and Pol polyproteins and are transcribed into a full-length genomic RNA that is subsequently packaged into virus-like particles (VLPs), in which reverse transcription takes place. The newly synthesized viral cDNA, which associates with viral and cellular factors to form the PIC, is then imported into the nucleus and integrates into the host genome (for review see [80]). A major difference between the replication of retroviruses and retrotransposons is that the latter lack an extracellular phase, due to the absence of Env glycoproteins. Since about 60% and 70% of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes respectively, are coding retrotransposons must integrate into a gene-rich, densely packed and timely haploid genome, avoiding suicidal disruption of essential genes [6]. Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that yeast retrotransposons exhibit a strong bias in integration site selection, a strategy that ensures a balance between the fitness of the host cell and the propagation and maintenance of the retrotransposon within the yeast genome [122]. 4.1. The yeast retrotransposons Yeast retrotransposons provide excellent models to study the molecular basis of integration of retro-elements, by analyzing both the role of retrotransposon proteins and genomic cis-acting sequences and the influence of cellular factors and target DNA structural organization. The molecular mechanisms of integration have been well characterized for several families of yeast LTR-retrotransposons, such as the copia-like family including Ty1, 2, 4 and 5 elements of S. cerevisiae, the gypsy-like family including Ty3 of S. cerevisiae and Tf1 and 2 elements of S. pombe [123]. Ty3 displays a strong bias for integration into regions lying upstream RNA PolIII-transcribed genes, such as tRNA, 5 S and U6 genes. Integration occurs preferentially within a short window of 1 to 4 nucleotides upstream the transcription initiation site of these genes [25]. Since there is no obvious sequence homology between these regions of integration, the specificity of insertion has been proposed to result from interactions between Ty3 PICs and the RNA PolIIItranscription machinery. Consistently, Ty3 integration is abolished when recruitment of RNA PolIII-transcription factors is impaired by mutations introduced even at positions distant from the integration site [25,26]. Moreover, this pattern of integration has been successfully recapitulated in vitro by using Ty3 VLPs, purified PolIIItranscription complexes and target plasmids harboring RNA PolIII-

dependent promoters [73]. Ty3 IN, TFIIIB and TFIIIC, two high molecular-weight cellular complexes recruited on RNA PolIII-dependent transcriptional units [56], are required for specific integration in vivo. TFIIIB acts as an essential cellular factor tethering Ty3 PICs to target DNA [149]. The Brf1 subunits of TFIIIB complex provides the docking specificity by directly interacting with Ty3 IN, while the Bdp1 subunits of TFIIIB, contributes to the efficiency of integration by stabilizing the multiprotein complex [150]. According to this model, TFIIIC is necessary to define the orientation of TFIIIB binding on the promoter [148,150]. Tf1, another retro-element belonging to the gypsy-like family like Ty3, colonizes the genome of the fission yeast S. pombe which is largely divergent from that of S. cerevisiae. Analysis of the integration profile of these retrotransposons provides therefore a unique opportunity to compare the molecular basis of site selection in two different host genomes. The complete sequence of S. pombe genome reveals that Tf1 preferentially integrates in the promoter-proximal regions of RNA PolIII-transcribed genes, 100 to 400 bp upstream the coding regions [5,129]. Two observations might explain this pattern. First, components of Tf1 PICs interact with RNA PolIII-specific transcription factors [78]. Second, Tf1 integration target-site specificity is linked to the chromodomain of IN and involves its interaction with histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 which is a mark of transcriptional activity [27,123]. It has also been reported that Tf1 displays a currently unexplained preference to integrate into the host chromosome III, within regions harbouring no apparent sequence similarities [129]. Ty1, Ty2 and Ty4 retro-elements integrate into gene-free regions within 750-nucleotide gaps upstream PolIII-transcribed genes both in vivo and in vitro [6,47,69,71]. However the precise molecular events underlying such specificity are not yet understood. Ty5 exclusively integrates at telomeres and at sites adjacent to the silent mating-type loci (HMR and HML). These locations tolerate insertional events without deleterious effect for the host genome [162]. The HM loci and telomeres mediate silent chromatin assembly by recruiting a large number of cellular proteins including the Silent Information Regulatory Proteins (Sir1­4p) [55], which are involved in telomere function and transcriptional inactivation of adjacent genes. Disruption of silent chromatin assembly at the HM loci by mutations within a specific sequence abolishes Ty5 integration in this particular region [161]. However, the DNA sequence per se is not the critical parameter determining specific integration. Indeed, a Ty5 mutant harboring a single amino acid substitution at the IN-to-RT boundary looses integration site specificity [53]. This mutation alters a sixamino acid domain in the C-terminal region of Ty5 termed the targeting domain (TD). The TD mediates the interaction between Ty5 IN and Sir4p and is necessary and sufficient to direct Ty5 genome insertion into silent chromatin [146]. More recently it has also been shown that phosphorylation of the TD critically regulates the interaction with Sir4p and consequently Ty5 targeting [39]. Conversely, Ty5 targeting into the HM loci is disrupted upon either mutations within Sir4p that disrupt the interaction with Ty5 IN [10] or depletion of Sir3p or Sir4p [160]. In conclusion, yeast retrotransposons have evolved many distinct mechanisms to achieve a similar goal: replication without host genome disruption. All these strategies are based on a tethering mechanism, which guides the integration machinery to adequate genomic sites [121]. 4.2. The animal retroviruses Soon after the discovery of the so called "RNA tumor viruses", it has rapidly been shown that tumorigenesis could result from integration of the viral genome within or near essential cellular genes, altering their expression [17]. Initial findings pointed out that retroviral integration occurs in a generally sequence non-specific fashion [142],

but that it could be influenced by the structure of chromatin [117]. Further studies revealed that proviral integration is in fact not a random process and that it is favored in open chromatin regions, near actively transcribed genes [37,128]. In the case of MLV, a positive correlation was observed between integration efficiency and DNAse Ihypersensitive chromatin regions [103,124,140]. For HIV-1, integration is disfavored in centromeric haploid repeats [20]. The improvement of high-throughput sequencing methodologies has recently allowed obtaining a global picture of the integration pattern of several retroviruses [82,102,105,126,144]. This technology has permitted to map over 500 integration events following infection of a human T cell line with HIV-1 and HIV-1-derived vectors and revealed that integration preferentially takes place in genes highly transcribed by RNA PolII [102,126]. This specific profile might indicate that, although deleterious for host cell survival, efficient HIV-1 gene expression is favored to maximize virus propagation. While HIV-1 proviruses are found along the entire length of transcription units (TU), MLV integration within TU is only slightly favored. Roughly 25% of MLV integration events distribute evenly upstream and downstream transcription start sites and in cytosine­phosphate­guanosine (CpG) islands [144]. FVs integration profile is similar to that of MLV [107,136], while Avian sarcoma­leukosis virus (ASLV) shows the most random pattern of proviral insertions since TU and transcription start sites are only weakly or not favored [102,105]. Following analysis of the genomic distribution of proviruses, retroviruses have been clustered in three groups according to their integration preferences: SIV and HIV, MLV and FVs, HTLV-I and ASLV [46]. While a correlation between the genetic environment and proviral insertion appears evident, only a weak local consensus sequence at the site of integration has been observed in the case of HIV-1 [60,66,145] and FVs [107], supporting the hypothesis that specific interactions between PIC components, host proteins and/or chromatin architecture could critically contribute to integration target-site selection. It is well established for instance that LEDGF/p75 is a key cellular partner of HIV-1 IN and an essential player in HIV-1 integration target-site specificity [34,35,89,90,138]. Following depletion of LEDGF/p75, proviral insertion within TU is drastically reduced [36] and, despite integration does not become completely random, new trends appear, including integration near CpG islands. In addition, bioinformatics study of 15 HIV-1 integration site data sets in different cell types showed that frequency of integration within TU is correlated with the expression levels of LEDGF/p75 [94]. The finding that IN proteins belonging to animal retroviruses other than lentiviruses does not display an evident affinity for LEDGF/p75 suggests that other cellular and/or viral proteins might act as cofactors during proviral integration [18,29]. This hypothesis could, at least in part, explain the differences in retroviral integration patterns observed so far. 5. A role of the structural Gag in tethering the retroviral PIC? As in other eukaryotes, telomeres in Drosophila melanogaster are composed by long arrays of repeated DNA sequences. However, fruit fly telomeres are characterized by the iteration of several copies of two retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART [81] that specifically transpose at the ends of chromosomes. This phenomenon has been described also in D. yakuba and D. virilis [21,22] and has been shown to maintain a correct chromosome length in these two species lacking functional telomerases. HeT-A and TART encode similar Gag proteins, that are efficiently transported into the nucleus [119]. Interestingly only HeTA Gag harbors the determinants targeting chromosome ends [118] and TART Gag localizes to telomeres only when HeT-A Gag is coexpressed, indicating that they might interact [118,119]. Additionally, HeT-A does not encode for a RT protein, a function that is provided in trans by TART. Taken together, these data highlight a symbiotic relationship between these two retro-elements, which is essential

O. Delelis et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1799 (2010) 207­216

211

both for replication and chromosome ends targeting. HeT-A and TART are the first transposable elements displaying a bona fide role in cell architecture, thus unrevealing an unexpected link between telomeres and DNA of parasitic origin [109]. In a manner similar to the Drosophila HeT-A retrotransposon, we have shown that the initial tethering of incoming FV PICs onto host chromosomes relies on the structural Gag protein [135]. Although sharing functional analogies with retroviral Gag proteins, FVs Gag presents distinct and unique structural features [42]. It lacks conventional landmarks of exogenous retroviral Gag, such as the major homology region or Cys­His motifs. Instead, FVs Gag proteins harbor conserved C-terminal basic motifs, referred to as Gly-Arg (GR) boxes. The first GR (GRI) box binds viral nucleic acids and is involved in viral genome packaging, whereas the second (GRII) harbors a NLS, responsible for the transport of nascent Gag proteins into the nucleus [125,152].

Soon after entry, Gag proteins together with the viral genome traffic along the MT network to reach the MTOC and are later detected into the nucleus [111]. These observations prompted us to study the significance of the nuclear stage of incoming Gag proteins in FVs replication. We have identified a short motif located in the C-terminal region of Gag, termed the chromosome binding sequence (CBS), that is necessary and sufficient for efficient tethering of incoming PICs onto host chromosomes through interaction with H2A/H2B core histones [135]. This function of FVs Gag resembles that of proteins encoded by episomal DNA viruses, which by binding both the viral genome and chromatin proteins, anchor the viral DNA onto host chromosomes [98]. For example, the Bovine Papilloma virus (BPV)-encoded protein E2 binds cellular chromatin in complex with Brd4 ensuring persistence of viral episomes (Fig. 1A). Among these proteins, Kaposi Sarcoma Herpes Virus (KSHV) latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA) bridges the viral genome and the host chromosomes [3] by

Fig. 1. Viral genome tethering onto host chromatin. Several strategies have been evolved by viruses to anchor their genome onto the cellular chromatin before integration. A. Bovine papilloma virus (BPV)-encoded protein E2 binds cellular chromatin in complex with Brd4 ensuring persistence of viral episomes [151]. B. KSHV genome replication and maintenance relies on its LANA protein, which simultaneously binds the LANA-binding region (LBR) of the viral genome and histone H2A/H2B heterodimers. C. In the case of HIV-1, cellular protein LEDGF/p75 binds viral IN and cellular chromatin facilitating PIC anchoring. D. Chromatin-tethering of FVs genome is mediated by viral Gag protein which interacts with the viral cDNA, through its GRI box, and the cellular DNA through its CBS. Despite evidence is currently missing, FVs Gag might also interact with viral IN.

interacting through its N-terminal CBS with the nucleosomal docking station constituted by H2A/H2B core histones [4] (Fig. 1B). Note, however, that in the case of FVs, IN plays also a determinant role in integration target-site selection [107,136]. As previously described, LEDGF/p75 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 integration and modulates its specificity. Thus, it is assumed that LDEGF/p75 binds HIV-1 IN to tether specific sequences onto the cell genome (Fig. 1C). Based on these findings, we propose a model according to which incoming FVs Gag bridges the viral cDNA genome, via its GRI domain, and host chromatin, through the CBS (Fig. 1D). Following this initial docking, which is not restricted to specific chromosomal locations due to the ubiquitous nature of FVs Gag-binding partners, H2A/ H2B, subsequent integration occurs when IN meets its specific host partner(s). FVs Gag might also play a role in integration site targeting, as it has been shown for MLV and HIV-1 by comparing the integration target-site selection of hybrid viral particles produced by substituting MLV genes for their HIV-1 counterpart within HIV-1 genome [82]. Indeed, chimeric viruses harboring the sequence of MLV IN into an

otherwise HIV-1 background display an integration pattern that is similar to that of MLV. This analogy was further increased when MLV Gag coding region was also introduced, supporting the hypothesis that IN is not the only viral determinant of integration specificity. 6. Local sequence specificity in viral integration? Extensive mapping of proviral integration sites underscored the existence of a weak palindromic consensus at the site of proviral insertion for both HIV-1 [60,66,145] and FVs [107]. Interestingly, FVs and HIV-1 show a preference for integrating into distinct palindromic motifs, which are similar, although not identical, to the sequences found at the cognate LTR­LTR junctions. Recently we showed that retroviral IN exhibits an endonucleolytic activity and specifically cleaves the cognate palindromic sequence at that LTR­LTR boundary [43,44]. This, as well as the symmetry observed at integration sites, indicates that IN might posses the intrinsic ability to bind preferentially symmetric DNA sequences. Since the tetrameric form of IN has

Fig. 2. Model of integration target-site selection by retro-elements. Retroviral PICs, composed of both viral and cellular proteins associated with the viral cDNA, form in the cytoplasm. Following access into the nucleus, PICs traffic along the elements of the nucleoskeleton to reach the sites of proviral integration. Selection of suitable target loci might require two sequential events (inset). First, docking onto host cell chromatin is facilitated by PIC components acting as molecular tethers. In the case of HIV-1, the cellular protein LEDGF/p75 directs viral PICs to transcription units (TU), by simultaneously binding HIV-1 IN and either cellular DNA and/or unknown chromatin factors (1). For FVs, tethering of PICs onto chromosomes relies on viral Gag proteins which interact with ubiquitous H2A/H2B core histones (2). Similarly, Gag proteins of fruit fly HeT-A retrotransposon harbor the determinants targeting telomeres where retrotransposition occurs (3). Next, PICs anchored on the host cell genome could scan adjacent regions of chromatin searching for good candidate site for integration. IN proteins might play a key role in targeting of chromatin-bound PICs to adequate genomic sites, where IN-mediated provirus insertion occurs. Integration is statistically favoured within weak palindromic sequences within TUs, CpG islands and chromosome ends in the case of HIV-1, FVs and fruit fly retrotransposons, respectively. If a suitable loci for proviral insertion is not found the viral PIC might undergo degradation. Formation of 1- and 2-LTR circles is enhanced when proviral integration is impaired. Alternatively, IN protein might use 2-LTR circles as substrates for integration following cleavage at the LTR­LTR junction and linearization (?).

been proposed to perform both digestion of palindromic viral LTR­ LTR junctions and concerted integration in the context of the synaptic complex [84,85], one could hypothesize that such multimeric organization is stabilized by a corresponding symmetry either at the viral DNA (LTR­LTR junction) and/or at the target DNA level (integration sites). The best characterized example of integration into specific regions of the host genome is represented by ZAM, a retrovirus-like element of D. melanogaster, which was initially identified by its insertion into the white locus [76]. ZAM integration targets the 5 GCGCGCg 3 motif [75], which is specifically recognized and cleaved by ZAM IN protein [52]. Remarkably this sequence is reminiscent of a well-characterized sequence specifically targeted by bacterial endonucleases to trigger foreign DNA digestion.

to reproduce more authentic integration reactions for mechanistic studies in vitro and for the development of new IN inhibitors [7,74]. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in integration target-site selection is crucial to design a new generation of viral vectors able to insert the therapeutic gene at desired locations, avoiding insertional mutagenesis. Alternatively, therapeutic integration could be employed as a strategy to treat retroviral infection by directing a deleterious DNA sequence (used as therapeutic gene) into a pathogenic provirus, thus leading to its inactivation [16,67]. Interestingly, chimeras between IN from animal retroviruses and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins have been undertaken to orientate viral integration without affecting the catalytic function of IN [130,133], demonstrating the feasibility of incorporating IN-fusion proteins into retroviral particles for the development of integration site-directed retroviral vectors.

7. Conclusions and perspectives Numerous studies have consistently contributed to a deeper understanding of the complexity of the life cycle of retro-elements, which to replicate rely on cellular functions at virtually every step. The recent development of genome-wide screening techniques has contributed to expand the list of cellular factors required for efficient replication of retroviruses [11,74,157] and retrotransposition of Ty elements (for review see: [97]). These approaches undoubtedly represent powerful tools for the identification of novel cellular candidates for the development of antiviral drugs, targeting cell functions required for viral replication. However, only few cellular factors have been concomitantly identified in different screenings performed so far, indicating that variations in experimental conditions have to be taken into account in the interpretation of the data. In addition, results need to be validated using complementary methods. However many questions still remain opened about the progression of the early events of the replication cycle of retro-elements. In particular i) the kinetics and the molecular mechanism of uncoating, ii) the nature of the cellular and viral determinants controlling nuclear import of the PICs, iii) the contribution of the elements of the nucleoskeleton in nuclear trafficking of viral PICs and iv) the precise mechanisms underlying selection of suitable sites for proviral integration (Fig. 2). Considerable efforts have been undertaken in recent years to dissect the molecular basis of retroviral integration, to establish the identity of viral determinants and the required cellular co-factors, and to define the rules governing integration target-site selection. Based on the current knowledge about the formation of the provirus, we propose a model according to which integration of retro-elements occurs via two sequential steps (Fig. 2, insert): first, tethering of PICs onto cellular chromatin and, second, the targeting of a suitable local environment (including the correct sequence) for insertion of the viral genome. The identification of a weak consensus sequence at the site of integration might indicate that palindromic sequences adopt a 3D arrangement which could be preferentially targeted [43,44,145]. Direct anchoring of PICs onto the cellular genome relies on viral proteins, such as Gag in the case of FVs and D. melanogaster retrotransposons, and/or cellular co-factors, like LEDGF/p75 for lentiviruses or components of PolIII-transcription machinery for Ty3, which are able to simultaneously interact with elements of viral PICs (viral cDNA and IN, respectively) and elements of cellular chromatin. On the basis of recent observations we hypothesize that, once tethered on cellular DNA, PICs from FVs and other animal retroviruses scan adjacent regions of chromatin searching for good candidate-sites for integration. On the contrary, integration takes place at locations proximal to the site of PICs-tethering onto chromatin in the case of Ty3 and Ty5 retrotransposons. A better comprehension of the importance of both IN co-factors and DNA arrangement in the modulation of IN activities will be crucial
