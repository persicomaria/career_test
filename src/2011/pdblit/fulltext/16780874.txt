Abstract The structural basis for the GTP-dependent co-translational targeting complex between the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor is unknown. The complex has been shown to have unusual kinetics of formation, and association in vivo is likely to be dependent on catalysis by the SRP RNA. We have determined conditions for RNA-independent association of the `NG' GTPase domains of the prokaryotic homologs of the SRP components, Ffh and FtsY, from Thermus aquaticus. Consistent with previous studies of the Escherichia coli proteins, the kinetics of association and dissociation are slow. The T. aquaticus FtsY is sensitive to an endogenous proteolytic activity that cleaves at two sites--the first in a lengthy linker peptide that spans the interface between the N and G domains, and the second near the N-terminus of the N domain of FtsY. Remarkably, this second cleavage occurs only on formation of the Ffh/FtsY complex. The change in protease sensitivity of this region, which is relatively unstructured in the FtsY but not in the Ffh NG domain, implies that it undergoes conformational change on formation of the complex between the two proteins. The N domain, therefore, participates in the interactions that mediate the GTPdependent formation of the targeting complex. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SR) function in co-translational targeting of nascent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells [1]. The SRP is a ribonucleoprotein that comprises a number of protein components, one of which, SRP54, both recognizes the signal sequence of the nascent polypeptide and interacts directly with the membrane receptor [2]. SRP54 and SRa are GTPases, with the GTPase activity of each mediated by structurally homologous `NG' domains in each protein [3 ­ 5]. In SRP54 the NG domain occurs N-terminally to the methionine-rich M-domain which mediates signal sequence recognition, and in SR, the NG domain occurs C-terminally to an `A' domain which appears to mediate membrane association of the receptor [6 ­ 8]. The GTP-dependent formation of the complex of SRP54 and SR at the membrane provides a key intermediate in the targeting pathway

[1,9 ­ 12]. However, the structural basis for the GTPdependent interaction remains unknown. Several components of the SRP machinery are universally conserved [2], and homologs of SRP54 (Ffh) and SR (FtsY) are found in prokaryotes [3,13]. The interaction in vitro between the purified components of the prokaryotic targeting complex, Ffh, FtsY, and 4.5S RNA has been characterized extensively [14 ­ 17]. It has been shown that the complex can be trapped in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable analog GMPPNP [14], and it has been shown that the 4.5S RNA, which is bound by the C-terminal Mdomain of Ffh, plays a catalytic role in the assembly of the complex [16,17]. Assembly of the complex, however, does not require the RNA [16], and, indeed, it appears that assembly requires neither the M-domain of Ffh nor the A domain (when present) of the FtsY, as the interaction between the two proteins is mediated entirely by the two NG GTPase domains [2,4,5]. A number of crystallographic studies have shown that the NG domains of Ffh and FtsY form a structural and functional unit [18 ­ 20]. Because the biochemical data implied that a minimal system comprising the two NG domains should exhibit interactions similar to those of the intact proteins and that

the kinetics of the association in the absence of the RNA would be slow, we reasoned that a minimal complex of the Ffh and FtsY NG domains from Thermus aquaticus could be readily purified and would provide a useful substrate for further studies. The task was simplified because the FtsY from T. aquaticus comprises only the NG domain (as has been observed in a number of species [21,22]). We found that, consistent with the behavior of the Escherichia coli Ffh/FtsY complex [16], both formation and dissociation of the NG domain complex proceeded slowly, allowing us to establish conditions for purification and stabilization of the complex in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GMPPCP. However, we also found that the T. aquaticus FtsY is susceptible to specific cleavage by an endogenous protease activity at two sites. The first is located in a linker peptide between the N and G domains that is predicted to be relatively disordered in the T. aquaticus protein. The second is near the N-terminus, and, remarkably, cleavage at this site appears to require formation of the Ffh/FtsY complex. When placed in the context of the crystallographic structures of the Ffh and FtsY NG domains these data provide direct evidence for re-arrangement of the N domain of FtsY on formation of the Ffh/FtsY NG complex.

were pooled, aliquoted and stored at À 20 jC. Samples were evaluated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and were estimated to be at least 95% pure. Approximately 30 mg of protein were obtained from 4 l of culture. 2.2. Complex formation reactions Ffh and FtsY NG domains were concentrated and the buffer exchanged using Centricon 30 devices (Millipore). Incubations for complex formation were carried out using 10 AM FtsY and 15 AM Ffh NG in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM NaCl (`low-salt' conditions) or 300 mM NaCl (`high-salt' conditions). GMPPCP (h-g-methyleneguanosine 5Vtriphosphate (Sigma)) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The Kd for the GMPPPNP-dependent complex of the E. coli Ffh and FtsY is on the order of 50 nM [16]; we assumed similar affinities between the T. aquaticus proteins and therefore maintained a 5-AM excess of Ffh NG in all complex association reactions. During the initial characterization of the behavior of complex formation, test reactions (100 Al) were incubated over a range of conditions, temperatures (25 ­70 jC) and times (1 h ­7 days). For production of the complex, a 5ml reaction was incubated at 37 jC for 4 days. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) standardized by quantitative amino acid analysis. Nucleotide concentration was determined by absorbance at 252 nm. 2.3. Purification of the Ffh/FtsY NG complex Complex formation was monitored using gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES (7.5). 2 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM NaCl. On this column the Ffh/FtsY NG complex is resolved from the two monomeric species, Ffh NG and FtsY NG (which elute together), and from unbound nucleotide analog. The complex peak could be distinguished as well by a change in the A280/A254 ratio due to the presence of bound nucleotide. The components present in the peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The Ffh/FtsY NG complex was purified for preparative purposes by anion exchange chromatography. The 5-ml reaction mixture was loaded directly onto a 1.6-ml Poros HQ column (Perseptive) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and the complex eluted using a linear gradient of 1 M NaCl in the same buffer. The Ffh/FtsY NG complex eluted after the NG domain of Ffh, at approximately 200 mM NaCl. The yield of the purified complex was f 75% of the maximum theoretical yield of the reaction (i.e., corresponding to 10 AM complex in the mixture). Peaks containing the complex (at f 0.4 mg/ml) were pooled, and the complex stabilized by addition of MgCl2 and GMPPCP to a final concentration of 1 mM. Complex was aliquoted, frozen, and stored at À 20 jC.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Purification of the NG domains The NG domain of T. aquaticus Ffh was expressed and purified as described previously [18]. The T. aquaticus FtsY, which comprises only the 304 residue NG domain, was expressed from a pET3-derived expression plasmid, pTP88 (obtained from C. Reyes and P. Walter, UCSF), maintained in the BL21(DE3)/RP strain of E. coli (Stratagene). A starter culture of 50 ml LB medium containing carbenicillin (100 Ag/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 Ag/ml) was inoculated from an isolated colony and the culture grown to an OD600 of 0.2 before being resuspended in 2 ml of media. This was then used to inoculate 4 l of LB with antibiotics, as above, and growth was continued at 37 jC until OD600 = 0.3, when expression was induced using IPTG (1 mM). Cells were harvested at OD600 = 0.8 and resuspended in 30 ml of buffer containing 20 mM EPPS (pH = 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme. After three liquid nitrogen freeze/thaw cycles, the cell paste was disrupted by sonication and then placed at 70 jC for 20 min. Cell debris and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 Â g for 30 min at 4 jC. The supernatant was passed over a 50-ml DE53 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris, pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, and the flow-through dialyzed against 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2 overnight. The dialysate was loaded on a 60 ml column of S-sepharose FF equilibrated with the same buffer, and the protein eluted using a linear gradient to 1 M NaCl. Fractions containing protein

2.4. Proteolysis studies For studies of proteolytic degradation the FtsY NG domain was incubated at 37 jC for 4 days in parallel with the complex formation reactions. The incubation mixture contained 10 AM FtsY in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM NaCl (`low-salt' condition) or 300 mM NaCl (`high-salt' condition). GDP or GMPPCP were added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Protease Inhibitor Cocktail containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) (at 0.2 mM final concentration), trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido(4-guanidino) butane (E-64) (0.14 AM), bestatin (0.13 AM), leupeptin (0.1 AM), aprotinin (0.03 AM) and sodium EDTA (0.1 mM) was obtained from Sigma. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Novex) and visualized by Colloidal Blue staining (Invitrogen). Cleavage products were blotted onto PVDF membrane (Novex) using standard methods and submitted for 5 ­ 7 cycles of N-terminal amino acid sequencing. 2.5. Mutagenesis of the FtsY NG domain A double mutant of FtsY (R17Q/L18M and R87Q/K88Q/ L89I) was constructed using PCR site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Two mutagenic oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon: the first was 5V -GCCAAGACCCGCGAGCAGATGCTGAAGGCCATTCCCTGG3V and the second, 5V , -CGCCGGGCCACCCTTCAGCAGATTGGCTTCAACCC-3V The presence of the mutations . in the expression clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The FtsY double mutant was expressed and purified in the same manner as the wild-type protein.

3. Results 3.1. Slow formation of the complex In our initial trials we assumed a Kd for the complex of f 50 nM based on studies of the E. coli proteins [16], and maintained a 5-AM excess (100 Â Kd) of one component during all reactions. Formation and dissociation of the E. coli Ffh/FtsY complex was found to be very slow in the absence of the 4.5S RNA [16] so in our trials samples were incubated for a wide range of times (to 7 days). The test samples contained 10 AM FtsY, 15 AM Ffh NG, and 1 mM GMPPCP, in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl. The two f 32-kDa proteins were expected to form an f65-kDa complex which could be readily distinguished by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 chromatography column. When samples were incubated for a short time interval (5 h at 70 jC, overnight at 42 jC and RT) no complex was detected (Fig. 1a). However, after 3 days' incubation at 37 jC, a peak migrating with a higher molecular weight was detected on the chromatogram, and the relative ratio of the peak heights continued to increase after 4 days' incubation time (Fig.

Fig. 1. Ffh/FtsY NG complex formation demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography. The 100-Al reactions were prepared with 10 AM FtsY, 15 AM Ffh NG and 1 mM GMPPCP in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl and were incubated for the indicated time interval and temperature. The full reaction mixture was injected onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl. HPLC traces (280 nm) correspond to: (a) 42 jC overnight, (b) 3 days 37 jC, and (c) 4 days at 37 jC. No complex was observed after short incubations (1 h to overnight) over temperatures ranging from RT to 70 jC. Results from control reactions (all carried out at 37 jC, 4 days) are shown: (d) FtsY alone with GMPPCP, (e) Ffh/FtsY complex reaction with GDP substituted for GMPPCP; and (f) the reaction mixture plus 2 mM EDTA. The position of the complex peak is indicated (asterisk), and the elution volumes of 29 and 150 kDa standards are shown. The expected ratio of the total absorbance at 280 nm for the complex peak relative to the monomer peak assuming 100% complex yield under these conditions is f 8.3 ­ 1.

1b,c). The two peaks were well resolved, with apparent molecular weights of 36 and 64 kDa based on the positions of protein standards, consistent with the predicted sizes of the monomeric proteins and the heterodimeric complex. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and revealed that both the slower eluting species (the two monomeric proteins) and faster eluting species (the Ffh/FtsY NG complex) contained both the Ffh and FtsY NG domains, as expected (see Fig. 3).

3.2. Complex formation is nucleotide triphosphate and Mg2+ dependent Formation of a stable Ffh/FtsY complex was dependent on the presence of the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide triphosphate analog as no complex was observed when the two proteins were incubated in the absence of added nucleotide, or in the presence of GDP (Fig. 1e). (Note that intrinsic GTPase activity of the thermophilic proteins was sufficient to obviate use of GTP in these assays.) In order to eliminate the possibility of homodimer formation during the incubation, the two proteins were incubated individually in the presence of GMPPCP. Under these conditions no new peak was detected (Fig. 1d). Finally, while both Mg2 + -dependent and Mg2 + -independent nucleotide binding modes have been demonstrated for the Ffh NG domain [23,24], the GTP hydrolysis activity of Ffh and SRP54, like other GTPases, requires the presence of magnesium [25 ­ 28]. That Ffh and FtsY each reciprocally stimulates the other's GTPase activity [29] implies that Mg2 + ,which binds at a specific site, should be required for assembly of the Ffh/ FtsY NG complex. This appears to be the case, as complex formation is dependent on the presence of magnesium, and addition of EDTA to the reaction mixture causes disappearance of the complex peak (Fig. 1f). 3.3. Slow dissociation kinetics In order to evaluate the kinetics of dissociation of the Ffh/ FtsY NG complex, reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for different time intervals in the presence of excess GDP (Fig. 2). The experiment exploits the observations that nucleotide exchange is rapid in the SRP GTPases and the affinities for GDP are five to 10-fold higher than for GTP [14,15,30,31]. Therefore, we expected that binding of GDP to the monomeric NG domains would make dissociation of the complex irreversible. This conversion of complex to monomers was then monitored using anion exchange chromatography. We found that after 18 h of incubation with GDP, 50% of the initial complex remained intact (Fig. 2). These data are consistent with the studies of the E. coli Ffh/ FtsY complex [16] where the half-life for the GMPPNPstabilized complex in the absence of 4.5S RNA was found to be approximately 15 h. 3.4. Cleavage of the FtsY NG domain During our characterization of the FtsY NG domain, we noticed a specific proteolysis event upon prolonged storage that yielded two products of apparent molecular weights f 22 and f 9 kDa on SDS-PAGE. During the 37 jC incubations required for complex formation the protein proved to be susceptible to this proteolysis as well, both in the absence of the Ffh NG domain (Fig. 3a, lane 4), and in its presence (Fig. 3a, lane 5). Thus, when the complex obtained under `low-salt' (50 mM NaCl) conditions was purified, it

Fig. 2. A slow dissociation rate for the complex. After a preincubation of a reaction mixture at 37 jC (100 Al, containing 10 AM FtsY, 15 AM Ffh NG, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM GMPPCP), GDP was added to 5 mM final concentration and the incubation continued at RT. Samples were taken at the indicated times (0 ­ 48 h). Dissociation of the complex in the presence of excess GDP was monitored using anion exchange chromatography on a Poros HQ column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mM MgCl2 and eluted with linear gradient of 1 M NaCl. After 18 h, f 50% of the initial complex was still intact.

was found to contain the intact Ffh NG domain, but only the two products of cleavage of the FtsY NG domain (Fig. 3a, lane 5) migrating at f 22 and f 6 kDa (see below). The cleavage was not affected by the presence or absence of GDP or GMPPCP and it was not prevented by addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) (data not shown). Subsequently, however, we found that incubation under `highsalt' conditions (300 mM NaCl) inhibited this proteolysis event (which we term cleavage at site `1'). Thus, after incubation at 37 jC for 4 days in high salt buffer, samples that contained the FtsY NG alone remained intact (Fig. 3b). 3.5. An alternate pattern of cleavage in the complex From these results, we expected that under `high-salt' conditions we would be able to purify complex containing intact FtsY. However, when we carried out complex formation reactions with buffer containing 300 mM NaCl we observed a new species that migrated between the intact FtsY NG domain and the Ffh NG domain on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3b, lane 4). In some of our reactions, complex formation did not go to completion, and in these cases, the unpurified reaction mixture included both the intact FtsY NG domain and its clipped product. Remarkably, however, only the clipped species co-purified with the complex on column chromatography (Fig. 3b, lane 5). Incubation of the two proteins in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of GDP under the same conditions did not yield the clipped product (Fig. 3b, lane 3). Consistent with these observations, a closer examination of the purified complex obtained under `low-salt' conditions reveals that the smaller of the two products of FtsY proteolysis is shifted relative to that

obtained in the absence of the complex (Fig. 3a, lane 5). This result suggests that cleavage at a second site (which must be near the N or C terminus) is associated with formation of the complex. We term this second site `2'. Cleavage at site 1 occurs in the free FtsY NG domain and presumably prior to or independently of complex formation, and it is inhibited by salt. Cleavage at site 2 is insensitive to salt concentration and occurs only in association with formation of complex. Therefore, protein recovered from purified complex is clipped at position 2, but depending on the salt concentration, may or may not be cleaved at position 1. 3.6. Sequences locate two cleavage sites In order to map the two cleavage sites, the products of proteolysis of the FtsY NG domain were blotted for Nterminal amino acid sequencing (Fig. 4). Two cleavage positions were identified unambiguously, but, interestingly, each sequence revealed a set of two staggered cleavage sites. Position 1 was determined from the sequence of the f 22-kDa band (see Fig. 3a), which indicated that cleavage occurs between Arg87 and Lys88 or between Leu89 and Gly90 at approximately equal frequency (based on their relative presence in the sequencing data). Position 2, which occurs only in the presence of the Ffh/FtsY NG complex, was determined from the sequence of the clipped f 30-kDa FtsY NG fragment obtained under `high-salt' conditions, and subsequently from the sequence of the f 6-kDa product obtained after cleavages at sites 1 and 2 under `low-salt' conditions (see Fig. 3). The sequences indicated cleavage between Leu18 and Leu19 or between Lys20 and Ala21 depending on whether the sample was prepared under `low-salt' (predominantly 18/19) or `high-salt' (predominantly 20/21) conditions. 3.7. Mapping the cleavage sites on the three-dimensional structure
Fig. 3. Different patterns of cleavage of FtsY free in solution and in the Ffh/ FtsY complex. Protein samples (10 AM FtsY and 15 AM NG) were incubated in `low-salt' conditions (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl) and `high-salt' conditions (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 300 mM NaCl) at 37 jC. GMPPCP or GDP were used at a final concentration of 1 mM. (a) `Low-salt' experiments. Lane 1--Mark 12 MW standard; lanes 2 and 3--Ffh and FtsY NG stored at À 20 jC; lane 4-- FtsY, nucleotide-free, 4 days at 37 jC; lane 5--Ffh/FtsY complex purified after 4 days at 37 jC. (b) `High-salt' experiments. Lane 1--Standard; lane 2--Ffh and FtsY NG nucleotide-free control, co-purified by gel filtration; lane 3--Ffh and FtsY NG incubated with GDP at 37 jC for 4 days; lane 4--Ffh/FtsY NG complex formation reaction mix, incubated with GMPPCP 37 jC for 4 days; lane 5--Ffh/FtsY complex purified by gel filtration. Note the appearance of the FtsY cleavage product during the GMPPCP incubation (lane 4) but not the GDP incubation (lane 3). After blotting to PVDF membranes, the fragments marked by arrowheads were cut out and sequenced. The bands are labeled (N-terminus and sites 1 and 2) corresponding to the N-terminal sequences obtained (see Fig. 4). Note that on this gel system FtsY and its larger cleavage products migrate slow relative to the markers and its smaller cleavage products migrate anomalously fast.

Because there is substantial sequence conservation between the members of the SRP GTPase subfamily (e.g., the sequences of the E. coli and T. aquaticus Ffh NG domains are 48% identical) we can locate the cleavage positions in the protein fold by using the available structures of the T. aquaticus Ffh NG domain [18], and the E. coli FtsY NG domain [19] (Fig. 5). The first site, 1, maps to a linker region between the N and G domains in both structures. This region shows substantial sequence variation between members of the SRP GTPase family [32], and it is relatively mobile and solvent-exposed in the crystal structures of the SRP GTPases [18,19]. In the sequence of the T. aquaticus FtsY the linker is particularly long, and it is not unreasonable to propose that the cleavage site 1 maps to a large disordered loop that is a solvent exposed and flexible. The second site, 2, maps in the structure of Ffh to a turn between the aN1 and aN2 helices of the N domain. Interestingly, however, it is here that the arrangement of

Fig. 4. Mapping the sites of proteolysis of FtsY. The sequences of the cleavage products of FtsY (indicated in Fig. 3) are shown on a linear map of the N domain of FtsY NG. Sequences identified the N-terminus (GFFDR), overlapping sites at position 1 (KLGFN and GFNPQ), and overlapping sites at position 2 (LKAIPWG and AIPxG). The secondary structure of the domain is diagrammed based on the published structure of the E. coli FtsY NG domain [19], patterns of sequence identity, and the position of the conserved `ALLEADV' motif between helices aN2 and aN3 (indicated by asterisks). The N domain comprises the first f 82 residues of the protein, the `linker' peptide, residues f 83 ­ 101, and the G domain, residues f 102 ­ 304. The three helices of the N domain that can be identified with confidence and are indicated (aN2, aN3, aN4). The N-terminal helix aN1 does not appear as such in the E. coli FtsY structure (see Fig. 5); the approximate position of the helix in Ffh NG is indicated (` f aN1 f '). The diagram is shaded by the percentage of sequence conservation at each position in the sequence (white, < 30%; light grey, 30 ­ 60%; grey 60 ­ 100%).

the polypeptide is quite different between the structures of the Ffh NG and the FtsY NG. In FtsY, there is no long aN1 helix and the region is much less regular, such that the

Fig. 5. A structural model for the locations of the cleavage sites. The positions of the two cleavage sites 1 and 2 are indicated relative to the structure of the E. coli FtsY NG domain (the G domain is truncated at right). Cleavage position 1 can be mapped to the linker peptide that extends between the N and G domains. This region varies widely in sequence and structure between different members of the SRP GTPase family, and may well be disordered and accessible to proteolysis in T. aquaticus FtsY. Cleavage position 2 maps to an N-terminal region that has somewhat irregular conformation and packs against the hydrophobic core of the N domain. The polypeptide backbone at position 2 is presumably inaccessible to proteolysis in the E. coli FtsY conformation, but would become accessible if the region underwent conformational change or if it became displaced in the complex. The position of the conserved `ALLEADV' motif is indicated (asterisks). This figure was generated using Molscript and Raster3d [43,44].

polypeptide is displaced towards its N terminus (Fig. 5). Cleavage site 2 maps to a region of the polypeptide that is packed in an irregular conformation against the hydrophobic core of the N-domain, at a position corresponding to that occupied by the aN1 helix in Ffh NG. That cleavage occurs there suggests that the polypeptide is conformationally variable in the different states of the protein, as we propose below. Despite cleavage of the linker peptide between the N and G domains of FtsY, the proteolytic fragments co-purify during gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography, demonstrating that after cleavage at site 1 the FtsY NG domain remains intact. This behavior is consistent with the presence of numerous of tight packing interactions between the N and G domains of Ffh and FtsY [19,23]. Furthermore, gel filtration chromatography of the complexes generated under `low-salt' and `high-salt' conditions (and cleaved at both positions 1 and 2, or at position 2 alone (see above)) showed that the two complex species migrate almost identically. This observation suggests that there is no further degradation of FtsY after cleavage at site 1, a point which we cannot establish by the sequencing data alone because we do not define the C-terminal sequence of either of the products of that cleavage. This conclusion is supported as well by the fact that complex formation is dependent on the presence of the nucleoside triphosphate analog, implying that there is a functional and intact interaction between the two proteins under both `low-salt' and `high-salt' conditions. 3.8. Mutations suggest proteolysis is sequence-independent Because susceptibility to cleavage appeared to be associated with a pattern of basic residues we generated neutral mutants at each of the susceptible sites (Fig. 4). The mutation introduced at site 1 was R87Q/K88Q/L89I, and the mutation introduced at site 2 was R17Q/L18M. Studies of the SRP54 in S. pombe [33] indicate that mutations introduced into regions of the yeast SRP54 close to these sites had little effect on

growth rates in yeast, and so we expected the mutations to be tolerated in the T. aquaticus protein. Indeed, the proteins expressed from plasmids containing the mutations were stable, and could be purified using the 70 jC incubation that was used for the wild-type protein. Remarkably, however, despite mutation of the cleavage sites, we observed the same pattern of proteolysis at sites 1 and 2 under low- and `highsalt' conditions. The cleavage product corresponding to site 1 was submitted for N-terminal sequencing, which revealed the site of the cleavage, between residues 87 and 88, to be identical to that seen in the wild-type protein despite the presence of the new sequence.

4. Discussion The GTP dependent interaction between SRP and its receptor is mediated primarily through their NG domains [4,5]. In this work, we have demonstrated that the NG domains of the two proteins Ffh and FtsY are sufficient for stable interaction in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GMPPCP, and that 4.5S RNA and the M domain of the T. aquaticus Ffh are not strictly required for their association. We find that the association and dissociation of the complex are slow, consistent with and supporting the conclusions of previous studies of the E. coli Ffh/FtsY complex [16]. Finally, we demonstrate changes in the pattern of proteolytic susceptibility of the T. aquaticus FtsY that imply that a conformational change of the N-domain of FtsYaccompanies the GTPdependent formation of its complex with Ffh. In Ffh, the N-terminal aN1 helix extends the full length of the domain, packing against three other helices to form a well-defined four-helical bundle. In FtsY, although there is clear structural correspondence with helices aN2, aN3 and aN4 (see Fig. 5), the N-terminal polypeptide exhibits an irregular packing arrangement such that the N-terminus of the protein (which in the E. coli FtsY structure is truncated from the additional `A' domain) is packed around the C-terminal helix and displaced from the N domain. Cleavage site 2 maps to a region of irregular conformation, but this region does not appear to be disordered in the crystal structure, consistent with the fact that the peptide is stable to proteolysis in the absence of formation of the Ffh/FtsY complex. A specific cleavage event that occurs only in the presence of the Ffh/FtsY NG complex implies strongly that there is a conformational change that makes site 2 vulnerable to proteolysis, and therefore that the N domain must be involved, directly or indirectly, in the structural rearrangements that occur during nucleotide dependent complex formation. Interestingly, mapping the cleavage site 2 onto the structure of Ffh NG places it at a terminal loop known to be highly flexible (and accessible to exogenous proteolysis [34]), suggesting that the conformational change might correspond to movement of the FtsY N domain helical structure towards that of the Ffh N domain. However, this is certainly not the only mechanism by which cleavage could be enabled--an alter-

native that simply exposes the cleavage site to solvent by displacement of the N terminal peptide might be equally appealing, so that the small peptide product does not remain associated in the complex, or is degraded. Whether this might be of physiological significance cannot yet be addressed. However, we note that the first 20­ 30 amino acids of the sequences of the FtsY NG domains diverge between species and from the sequences of the Ffh NG domain [32], raising the possibility that the region has few, or different, functional and structural constraints. Interestingly, a membrane-dependent cleavage in the linker peptide between N and G domains of E. coli FtsY has been reported previously [7]. In that case, a novel membrane-bound isoform of FtsY composed of only the A and N domains was observed, and proteolysis was proposed to be due the action of a membrane-associated protease, although a candidate for this membrane-associated protease remains uncertain. Changes in the pattern of proteolysis of M. mycoides Ffh on binding nucleotide have been demonstrated as well [34]. In that study, binding was accompanied by a change in susceptibility due to a conformational change that can be inferred, from comparison of the corresponding crystal structures [23], to reflect the movement of the `closing loop' against the bound nucleotide. In the T. aquaticus Ffh and FtsY, in the absence of added proteases, we do not see a similar pattern of cleavage. The nature of the proteolytic activity seen in our experiments remains unclear. Cleavage appears to be sequence independent, as mutations of the cleavage sites failed to prevent proteolysis at the same position. As noted above, the cleavage sites may be distinguished instead by being particularly disordered and solvent exposed, such that the peptide backbone could become accessible to cleavage by a relatively nonspecific protease or proteolytic contaminant. However, we have not excluded the possibility of a selfcatalyzed protein rearrangement, as occurs in protein splicing and autoproteolysis [35,36], and these questions, therefore, remain for further study. Nevertheless, although not yet fully understood, the proteolytic susceptibility of T. aquaticus FtsY provides structural insight, because only on forming complex does FtsY becomes susceptible to cleavage close to its N-terminus. The G domains of the Ffh and FtsY must be directly involved in complex formation, of course, because not only is association dependent on nucleotide binding, but in the complex the two proteins reciprocally stimulate the other's GTPase activity [29]. This function is likely to be mediated by interactions local to the active site of the GTPase, as is seen in the structures of other GTPases complexed with their activating proteins [37 ­ 40]. Furthermore, evidence from fluorescence studies suggests that a tryptophan located in the effector subdomain (the `IBD') of E. coli FtsY, at the opposite end of the G domain from the N/G interface, is in a significantly different environment on formation of the GTP-dependent complex with E. coli SRP (i.e., Ffh and 4.5S RNA) [15].

However, a number of lines of evidence suggest that the region of interaction between the two proteins may be more extensive [41,42]. Recent studies have identified mutations of Ffh likely to disrupt the conformation of the N/G interface that are not defective in substrate binding or intrinsic GTPase activity, but that are defective specifically in the formation of the complex with receptor, FtsY [42]. A corresponding mutant in FtsY was found to have a similar phenotype. Thus, complex formation requires that the N/G interface be intact [42]. It was also found that mutations of the E. coli Ffh that eliminate its intrinsic GTPase activity do not necessarily abrogate stimulation of GTP hydrolysis in the complex (presumably by FtsY) [42]. Conformational change in the N domain of T. aquaticus FtsY on formation of its complex with Ffh is consistent with these observations, which together raise the intriguing possibility that the N domains of each protein might play a direct role in their interaction. These results also argue against models of the targeting complex that limit the interaction to the GTPase active sites of the two proteins [20]. The purification of the Ffh/FtsY NG complex will allow us to more precisely examine the kinetics of the association and dissociation of the complex, and it provides the groundwork for biochemical characterization of the structural basis for the interaction between SRP and its receptor. The role of the N-domain in the SRP GTPases has long remained a puzzle. The irregular conformation of the N-terminus of the N domain in the structure of the E. coli FtsY, and the conformational change of the T. aquaticus FtsY N domain implied by its transition to a protease sensitive state in the Ffh/FtsY complex, suggest that perhaps the N-terminal region of the FtsY NG domain is quite dynamic. Thus, conformational changes of the N domain could play a fundamental role in the formation of the GTP-dependent SRP/SR complex during co-translational protein targeting.
