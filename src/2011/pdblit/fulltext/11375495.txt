Cryocooled crystals of a mercury complex of Escherichia coli Ê dUTPase diffract to atomic resolution. Data to 1.05 A resolution were collected from a derivative crystal and the structure model was derived from a Fourier map with phases calculated from the coordinates of the Hg atom (one site per subunit of the trimeric enzyme) using the program ARP/ wARP. After re®nement with anisotropic temperature factors a highly accurate model of the bacterial dUTPase was Ê obtained. Data to 1.45 A from a native crystal were also collected and the 100 K structures were compared. Inspection of the re®ned models reveals that a large part of the dUTPase remains rather mobile upon freezing, with 14% of the main chain being totally disordered and with numerous side chains containing disordered atoms in multiple discrete conformations. A large number of those residues surround the activesite cavity. Two glycerol molecules (the cryosolvent) occupy the deoxyribose-binding site. Comparison between the native enzyme and the mercury complex shows that the active site is not adversely affected by the binding of mercury. An unexpected effect seems to be a stabilization of the crystal lattice by means of long-range interactions, making derivatization a potentially useful tool for further studies of inhibitor± substrate-analogue complexes of this protein at very high resolution.

1. Introduction
The essential enzyme 2H -deoxyuridine 5H -triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) catalyses the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate (Bertani et al., 1961; Greenberg & Somerville, 1962). It maintains a central role in nucleotide metabolism and in the regulation of DNA synthesis (Kornberg & Baker, 1991). Various techniques have previously been used to characterize different members of the large dUTPase family, including molecular and structural biology approaches as well as physico-chemical studies, inhibitor screenings and cell biology. Studies have been initiated within a European Consortium for dUTPase research to explore the possibility to utilize dUTPase as a potential drug target. Viral, parasitic and bacterial enzymes are being investigated and compared with the human form of dUTPase and species-speci®c potent inhibitors are being developed. Three different subunit organizations of dUTPases have been found. dUTPases are either monomers, dimers or trimers (Persson, 1998) and in the majority of them ®ve conserved sequence motifs (McGeoch, 1990) have been identi®ed. Monomeric and trimeric dUTPases are highly speci®c for dUTP (Larsson, Nyman et al., 1996; Bergman et al., 1998). The protozoan dimeric enzyme from Leishmania major can, in contrast, also utilize dUDP, a potent inhibitor for monomeric

and trimeric dUTPases (Nord et al., 1997), as a substrate (Camacho et al., 2000). The dUTPase-catalyzed reaction requires the presence of Mg2+ ions (Larsson, Nyman et al., 1996) and water participates in the cleavage of the phosphor± ester bond (G. A. Rogers, personal communication). X-ray structures of several trimeric dUTPases are known to moderately high resolution (Cedergren-Zeppezauer et al., 1992; Mol et al., 1996; Prasad et al., 1996, 2000; Dauter et al., 1999; Larsson, Svensson et al., 1996). To describe the active site of dUTPases with any precision, the accuracy of the structural data needs to be high. Small ions such as Mg2+ are dif®cult to detect at low resolution and the actual waterbinding pattern in the active site is not well de®ned at a Ê resolution around 2 A, to which all but one of the known structures have been solved. Most structures cited above were solved with data from crystals at room temperature or 277 K. In this work, we have collected data from frozen crystals of the trimeric E. coli dUTPase at 100 K and extended the resolution of the structure to the atomic level. This was achieved through stabilization of the enzyme by addition of ethylmercurythiosalicylate (Thimerosal). The structure of this derivative was solved ab Ê initio using a single data set at 1.05 A resolution and iteratively building up the model using a map calculated initially from a single mercury site per subunit of the trimer. This approach has been successful for small molecules (Perrakis, Antoniadou-Vyza et al., 1999) and metalloproteins (Benini et al., 2000; Perrakis et al., 1997). Here, we demonstrate that it is also useful in the case of a heavy-atom derivative of a protein. Ê The re®ned model of E. coli dUTPase to 1.05 A resolution will be used in the detailed description of the structure and will be utilized as a structural guide for future design of inhibitory compounds. To ensure that the heavy-metal interactions did not distort the structure, the mercury-bound enzyme was also compared with the native enzyme structure re®ned against Ê data collected to 1.45 A under identical conditions.

Ê beamline BW7B at a wavelength of 0.83 A. The diffraction Ê limit for the native crystals was 1.45 A at 100 K; the space group was the same as for the mercury derivative but the unitcell parameters were slightly different (a = b = 85.821, Ê c = 60.476 A), with a maximum difference in the c axis of 2.1%. Image integration was carried out with the program MOSFLM (Leslie, 1991). The data were scaled and merged with SCALA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The merging statistics are shown in Table 1. The structure-factor amplitudes were derived from the averaged intensities with the program TRUNCATE (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994; French & Wilson, 1978). The overall temperature factor was estimated from Wilson plots (Wilson, 1942) using all the re¯ections at a Ê resolution higher than 2 A.

3. Ab initio structure solution of the mercury derivative
In the derivative structure, the position of the Hg atom was obtained from an isomorphous Fourier difference map FH À FN. FH are the observed structure factors for the mercury-derivative data and FN are the amplitudes and phases calculated from the native room-temperature structure of E. coli dUTPase (ID code 1dup; Dauter et al., 1998) available from the PDB (Bernstein et al., 1977). A 22' level peak was also found in the Harker section of the anomalous difference Patterson map with coef®cients FH(+) and FH(À), corresponding to the same site. Although the heavy-atom position could have thus been derived from the derivative data only, making use of the existing native data made it possible to select the correct hand of the site coordinates without an additional trial. The procedure proposed by Perrakis, Antoniadou-Vyza et al. (1999) was then used to solve the derivative structure ab initio. The program ARP/wARP (Perrakis, Morris et al., 1999; Lamzin et al., 1999) was combined with re®nement with the program REFMAC, which uses a maximum-likelihood target (Murshudov et al., 1997) to automatically build and re®ne O-atom positions in a density map initially calculated from the position of the single Hg atom.

2. Crystal preparation, data collection and processing
The puri®cation procedure of E. coli dUTPase has been described by Hoffmann et al. (1987). The mercury-derivative crystals were obtained from a solution containing 5 mM succinate at pH 5.5, 100 mM sodium ethylmercurythiosalicylate (Thimerosal, Hampton Research), 3 mg mlÀ1 dUTPase in 10 mM bis-tris buffer at pH 6.2 and 1.5% polyethylene glycol 8000. Native enzyme crystals were prepared under similar conditions in the absence of heavy-atom salt. For data collection at 100 K the crystals were cryoprotected by a short immersion into a solution of mother liquor containing 15% glycerol. The mercury-derivative crystals diffracted to atomic resoÊ lution. A data set to 1.05 A was collected from a frozen crystal Ê at EMBL Hamburg beamline X11 (! = 0.91 A) using a fast image-plate scanner (MAR X-ray Research GmbH, Hamburg). The crystals belonged to space group R3 and the Ê unit-cell parameters were a = b = 85.742, c = 61.749 A. Data from a native enzyme crystal was collected at EMBL Hamburg

In the two initial model building and re®nement cycles atoms were added one by one (at distances between 1.0 and Ê 3.3 A from an existing atom) based on electron-density peaks in the mFo À DFc Fourier map calculated after maximumlikelihood unrestrained re®nement. Fo and Fc are the scaled observed and calculated structure factors, m is the ®gure of merit and D is the Fourier transform of the probability distribution of the coordinate error (Luzzati, 1952). These coef®cients are calculated using the free re¯ection set in order to minimize bias to the model (Murshudov et al., 1997). Atoms were merged when too close to each other or when appearing in too low density (below 0.3') in a 3mFo À 2DFc density map. In subsequent cycles, the ' cutoff to ®nd and reject atoms was increased successively. The maximum number of new atoms allowed was also increased. The total number of O atoms searched was based on the number of residues in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. At the end of the fourth cycle the wARP model, consisting of 1925 O atoms, was considered to be complete. The R factor for this model was 20%. After rejection of badly placed atoms and a further REFMAC/ARP building cycle, automatic chain tracing was attempted by searching the O-atom model for groups of atoms ful®lling the distance and angle criteria expected for peptide chains. 108 residues scattered along ten polypeptide stretches were found in the ®rst cycle. Each main-chain tracing cycle was followed by further addition and removal of atoms based on mFo À DFc and 3mFo À 2DFc Fourier maps, respectively. Automatic tracing of 132 of a total of 136 ordered residues was achieved after 40 cycles of autobuilding, substantially less than the number recommended in the program manual. The optional automatic side-chain docking procedure correctly assigned 49 side chains for the ordered residues. Residues 137± 152 could not be traced either automatically or manually. The whole automated building procedure took approximately 28 CPU hours on an SGI O2 R10000 workstation (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA, USA). The automatically traced model was close to the ®nal re®ned model, Ê with an r.m.s. difference between them of only 0.066 A for the main chain. However, some side-chain positions had to be corrected and multiple conformations in both the main chain and side chains had to be modelled manually.

mated re®nement using the program ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1997) and conjugate-direction re®nement (Tronrud, 1992) as implemented in REFMAC. The geometry was restrained to the standard Engh and Huber values (Engh & Huber, 1991). Isotropic temperature factors were re®ned for individual atoms. At this stage, visual inspection of the Fourier difference maps showed residual electron density near the active site and the Hg atom. Glycerol was found to ®t the density at the active site, while a strong peak in the 2mFo À DFc map (25') near the mercury main peak (50') was interpreted as an alternative position for the heavy atom. Further re®nement of the structure was carried out with the program SHELXL97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). The model was re®ned against experimental intensities using the conjugate-gradient algorithm and a diffuse solvent correction was applied (Moews & Kretsinger, 1975). The occupancies for the Hg atoms and the glycerol molecules were re®ned. The relative occupancies of multiple side-chain conformations were re®ned restraining the sum of the occupancies to unity. After restrained anisotropic re®nement of all atoms, more multiple conformations were introduced in the model (mainchain and side-chain atoms, water atoms and a third mercury position). The occupancy of waters with a temperature factor Ê larger than 40 A2 was set to 0.5. For waters near disordered side chains the occupancy was set to the same value as the conformer at the optimal distance for hydrogen bonding. H atoms generated from ®xed stereochemistry were included at the end of the re®nement.

The initial model used for the re®nement of the native dUTPase structure was the atomic resolution model of dUTPase (polypeptide chain and waters) before re®nement with SHELXL. The native structure model was re®ned against the native data with SHELXL97 using a protocol similar to that used for the mercury complex. As the ratio number of observations:number of atoms (4.6) differs owing to the lower Ê resolution of the native data set (1.45 A) only the S atoms were re®ned anisotropically. There are seven S atoms in total in the subunit: one in a cysteine residue (which is the mercurybinding site) and six in methionine side chains.
4.3. Accuracy of the models

After the re®nement, a block-matrix least-squares minimization was carried out to estimate errors in coordinates and temperature factors. The statistics for both re®ned models are given in Table 2. Visual inspection of the models was performed on Silicon Graphics workstations using the program TURBO-FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1991) and the stereochemical quality of the ®nal models was checked with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). È The free R factor (Brunger, 1993) was used as a validation test throughout the re®nement. In the last cycle all the re¯ections were included, but this did not cause a drop in the R factor. This has also been observed in the re®nement at

atomic resolution of Fusarium solani cutinase (Longhi et al., 1997), while in the case of Streptomyces aureofaciens RNase (Sevcik et al., 1996) inclusion of the Rfree set of re¯ections in the re®nement caused a drop in the R factor of 0.3%. Longhi and coworkers suggested that the different behaviour of the re®nement might be related to the lower data-to-parameter ratio (5.5 for cutinase, 3.6 for RNase) affecting the convergence of the re®nement. In the case of the dUTPase mercury derivative, the data-to-parameter ratio is 5.7. Thus, the behaviour of the re®nement is consistent with the above hypothesis. The ®nal R-factor value for the mercury-derivative structure of the enzyme (14.1%) is slightly higher than expected for atomic resolution structures (Fig. 1), where the R factor often lies within the range 8±12% (Dauter et al., 1995). The high R-factor values could partly be a consequence of the 14 totally disordered residues at the C-terminal tail of the protein. Although they are present in the crystal (Dauter et al., 1998), the absence of a model for these residues is likely to affect correct modelling of the solvent and to be a source of disagreement with the data. The highest resolution weaker data also contribute to the high overall R-factor value, as can Ê be seen in Fig. 1. The overall R factor to 1.1 A is 13.3%. In the following description we will mainly refer to the most accurate of the structures, the dUTPase±Hg complex, unless otherwise stated.

meters shrink by about 1% in the derivative structure and by up to 3% on the c axis of the low-temperature native crystal compared with the unit-cell parameters at higher temperature. Despite these unit-cell changes, the fold and overall hydrogenbonding pattern are very similar to the room-temperature structure previously described (Cedergren-Zeppezauer et al., 1992; Dauter et al., 1998). Difference electron-density maps showed some peaks which could be assigned to H atoms in the well ordered buried areas of the atomic resolution structure (Fig. 2), but most H atoms were not visible in the maps.
5.1. High degree of disorder

Both the native and the derivative 100 K structures have many disordered parts, such as the C-terminal tail comprising residues 137±152, which were not visible in difference Fourier maps of this enzyme and are presumably disordered and not

visible in any crystallographic electron-density map (Cedergren-Zeppezauer et al., 1992; Larsson, Svensson et al., 1996; Dauter et al., 1998). While the N-terminal methionine side chain is poorly re®ned in the low-temperature structure, with B factors taking extremely large values as seen in Fig. 3(c), some other exposed side chains which were not found in density in the room-temperature structure (Lys3, Lys4, Lys16, Lys77, Gln106 and Glu129) could be modelled. At 100 K these side chains could be totally or partly de®ned in double conformations, albeit with temperature factors above the Ê average (17.8 A2). The exception is Gln106, where all the atoms are clearly de®ned in the electron density at a level of 1.8'. At low temperature this residue interacts with the neighbouring monomer (Gly46), possibly increasing the stability of the trimer. A total of 37 residues, mostly in exposed areas of the monomer, were found with several atoms in alternate positions at 100 K, including two residues at the monomer± monomer hydrophobic interface area (Met67 and Pro124). In the loop region (see Table 4 in Dauter et al., 1998) comprising residues 15±17 the whole polypeptide chain is in a double conformation. This shows that in these crystals, while some mobile side chains tend to become `immobilized' in two preferred conformations, freezing of the crystal does not increase the order. In general, there is a high degree of dynamic disorder which does not decrease as the resolution of the data is increased (Table 2). This might further add to the relatively high R values.

Figure 3

The 100 K and room-temperature models differ in the active-site cavity by the presence of the cryoprotectant glycerol (Fig. 4). Two glycerol molecules displace water molecules and two of the O atoms of each glycerol take the place of the expelled waters maintaining the general hydrogen-bonding pattern of the active site. One of the glycerol molecules, Glyc139, is stacked with a tyrosine side chain (Tyr93) in a position similar to that of the deoxyribose in the structure of the E. coli enzyme in complex with dUDP (Larsson, Svensson et al., 1996). The other glycerol, Glyc138, with a somewhat lower occupancy, is located deeper in the active-site crevice and interacts with the side chain of Asn84, a residue known to be important in substrate and water interactions. There may be a hydrogen bond between O3 of Glyc138 and O1 of Glyc139 and between the O2 atoms of both glycerol molecules. All the water molecules present in the roomtemperature model were also found in the derivative low-temperature structure, except for the three of them displaced by the glycerol molecules. Because the glycerol molecules do not bind with full occupancy, it is possible that these water sites are still partially occupied in the low-temperature structure. This might explain the peak height of 5' found at the O3 position

in Glyc139 shown in Fig. 4. The O3 atom is occupying the position of one of the displaced water molecules. Two additional water molecules are observed in the active site in the low-temperature structure. Water 445 has low occupancy and is buried. It might have been pushed aside by the presence of Glyc139 and could be responsible for the adoption of one of the alternative conformations of Met68. Water 401 may have been displaced by Glyc138 and positioned closer to the side chain of Lys77, causing it to adopt a different conformation compared with the unliganded room-temperature structure. The r.m.s. distance between the room-temperature (where glycerol is not present) and the low-temperature derivative Ê Ê structure is 0.73 A for the atoms in residues 61±93 (0.17 A for the main-chain atoms). The residues in this stretch are all located in the active site. The small difference between the models around this area indicates that apart from the changes discussed above, the binding of glycerol does not grossly alter the E. coli dUTPase structure. Residues Ser72, Asp90 (conserved among dUTPases) and Asp92 (part of the tyrosine hairpin loop in the active site) could be modelled in multiple conformations. This may be a consequence of the better quality of the electron-density maps Ê at 1.05 A rather than being a feature of the structure at 100 K, because the multiple side-chain conformations are within hydrogen-bonding distance of water molecules which are also present in the room-temperature structure.
5.3. Heavy-atom site

The Hg atom in the atomic resolution structure can be seen in three different positions (Fig. 5) with varying bond distances to the S atom of Cys36. This is the only cysteine residue in the sequence and the side chain is located in a small hydrophobic Ê cavity. Sites A and B at 2.452 and 2.284 A (e.s.u. 0.006 and Ê 0.007, respectively) are the major sites. Site C at 2.370 A (e.s.u. 0.014) has a much lower occupancy. These bond distances were left unrestrained during the re®nement. The variety of bond lengths and positions for the Hg atom can be explained by the ¯exibility of the polypeptide chain around the binding cavity, with an abundance of mobile side chains (Asp11, Arg13, Asn38) surrounding the cysteine groove. Typical cysteine±mercury bond lengths reported for structures in the Ê PDB range between 2.28 and 2.36 A (Nair et al., 1991; Church et al., 1986; Nagar et al., 1996; Sinha et al., 1999). Weak elongated density near the most occupied metal site (A) could be assigned to the ethyl moiety of sodium ethylmercurythiosalicylate. The distance between the closest ethyl C atom and Ê the highest occupied mercury site is 2.066 A and the S Ð HgÐC angle is 171 . Sinha et al. (1999) report an angle of 165 for two-coordinated Hg. The close agreement in bond angles and distances with this structure implies that the thiosalicylate group leaves upon derivatization. In the 100 K native structure Arg13 points towards the solvated Glu17 and its N forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule in the cysteine cavity. In the derivative model this water is absent and the arginine side chain is in a clear double conformation with the amine groups in both conformers directed towards the mercury site and residues Asp11 and Asn38, forming hydrogen bonds to both of these residues

which do not exist in the native structure. Glu17 is also disordered, as is the whole peptide chain down to Gly15. This part of the structure is a loop situated close to strand -I of a neighbouring subunit (for strand numbering, see CedergrenZeppezauer et al., 1992). Lys16 N is involved in a direct hydrogen bond to Glu42 O of a neighbouring monomer. These additional contacts may contribute to the stability of the crystal and explain the better diffraction properties of E. coli dUTPase after formation of the mercury derivative. No further signi®cant differences were found between the two structures. In particular, the active site seems to be unaltered by the covalent attachment of the heavy-atom compound to Cys36.
5.4. Solvent structure

A total of 298 water molecules were modelled in the atomic resolution derivative structure, many of which are absent from the room-temperature structure. There are approximately 50 waters with two or more protein ligands. About 85% of the well ordered waters in the ®rst solvation shell, with temperaÊ ture factors below 30 A2, are present in both the 100 K and room-temperature models. Some of the waters playing important structural roles in the 100 K model are, however, not present in the room-temperature model, such as water 248, which binds to the main chain at Leu137 N and Ala135 O, or waters 237, 250 and 279, involved in trimer±trimer interactions. Nearly 60% of the waters have no protein ligands, binding to other water molecules instead. These waters tend to have Ê temperature factors higher than 30 A2 and appear at lower levels in electron-density maps. They might be important in stabilizing the protein, since they often cluster at monomer± monomer interfaces, such as (i) the crevice formed by the helix Ser72±Gly79, the loop Arg104±Ser108 and the loop Ala44± Thr48 from the neighbouring monomer, (ii) the cavity above the hydrophobic cluster along the crystallographic threefold axis, (iii) the entry to the active-site cavity and (iv) the large area along the extended C-terminal arm (from Gln127) which wraps around the N-terminal part of another monomer.

Despite the improvement of resolution, many exposed parts of the structure remain ¯exible and dif®cult to model adequately. Thus, structural details of the enzyme relevant to its mechanism still remain unknown, although a thorough kinetic analysis has been made (Larsson, Nyman et al., 1996). As the active site is remote from the mercury-binding site and no signi®cant structural differences have been found in this area when comparing the derivative and the native enzyme, we assume that the derivatization of the protein does not affect normal function. This assumption is strengthened by results obtained by G. Rogers (personal communication) who reacted E. coli dUTPase with Ellman's reagent (interacting with SH groups) without disturbing the activity of the enzyme. Therefore, the Hg±dUTPase complex could become important in further studies of the function of the enzyme, particularly in structure determinations of inhibitor complexes. Since glycerol could be a potential competitor for ligand binding, an alternative cryoprotectant should be found for these studies. From a purely crystallographic point of view, the contribution of mercury (or other heavy atoms) to high-resolution diffraction data offers the possibility of easily solving a structure ab initio, similarly to that presented here. The high completeness and accuracy of the automatically traced model shows the value of this approach for automated structure determination. As in the case of structures solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD), this approach allows the characterization of small changes in the structure without bias to a pre-existing model. The small r.m.s. difference between the automatically traced and the ®nal re®ned model shows that very accurate phases can be determined with totally objective criteria. The initial electron-density maps can thus be used to compare theoretical solvent models, as suggested by Burling et al. (1996) for high-resolution MAD maps. The advantage with respect to the MAD method would be the considerably smaller amount of data required for structure solution, which could be crucial when radiation damage becomes a serious problem.

6. Conclusions
The presence of mercury bound to the single free cysteine in E. coli dUTPase, in combination with cryocooling of the crystals to 100 K, made it possible to collect data to atomic resolution, allowing visualization of the structure to a ®ner Ê detail than previously achieved. Data to 1.05 A were collected in this study, but it might be possible to reach even higher resolution using a more intense synchrotron source or longer exposures. Higher resolution would increase the observationto-parameter ratio, allowing an even more accurate re®nement of the structure and de®nition of H-atom positions. The stabilizing effect of the mercury compound seems to take place through long-range interactions, possibly improving contacts within and between trimers along ¯exible parts of the polypeptide chain.
