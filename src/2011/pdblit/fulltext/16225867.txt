and confQurational details of glyphosate recognition in its herbicidal ternarycomplex with enzyme and ~bikimate-

The enzyme EPSP (S-enolp~voyl-sh~~~-3-phospha~)

synthase (EPSPS, EC 251.19) has

generated considerable interest since it functions as the biilogical target for the commemially successful h~icjde, glyphosate (PMG).z EPSPS catalyzes an unusual transfer ma&on of the carboxyvinyl portion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) regiospe&ically to the 5-OH of S3P forming EPSP and inorganic phosphate (pd.3 The enzyme exhibits a random kinetic mechanism4 through a single, kinetically competenffi tightly bound,6 tetrahedral intermediate, 1 (Scheme 0.

To function as a transition state inhibitor, glyphosate should overlap completely with 3, even

though

it contains one extra atom between the anionic centers. The planar configuration of 3 requires that the ionic phosphonic and carboxylate functionalities of glyphosate be bound in a "pinched"conformation with each anionic group on the same side of the nitrogen atom. Molecular modeling studies indicate that this "pinched' conformation of glyphosate can be superimposed on PEP, without any energy penalty.t2 The ~exi~~~ of glyphosate allows it to adapt a ~nfo~~on where each anionic group can be superimposed on PEP, with the methylene groups oriented above and below the plane.

Recent microcalorimetty effectively measurements indicate that S3P synergizes glyphosate biding much more ternary than PEP.16 These results are consistent with the suggestion that the EPSPSS3P.PMG

complex resembles the transition state leading to 1. Since PMG binds nearly 75-fold mote tightly to EPSPS than PEP,9 appropriate bisubstrate analogs should be very potent EPSPS inhibitors. However, the exact spatial

relationship between S3P and PMG in this ternary complex is not known.

Phosphonate 5 is also reported to be competitive versus pi with an apparent K, of 0.11 f 0.02 @VI.Thus, a direct quantitative compatison indicates there is a significant difference in their potency and pattern
with

EPSPS. If PMG occupies exactly the same space as PEP when S3P is present, one would expect a

dramatically more potent Ki for 4 versus EPSP and competitive kinetic patterns versus Pi. Competitive inhibition versus Pi is expected for tight binding bisubstrate inhibitors based on the proposed random kinetic mechanism for the EPSPS reverse reaction.31 The observed competitive behavior for 4 versus EPSP (Ki = 7.4 f 0.4 W) suggests that 4 can occupy the S3P/EPSP site quite well, whereas the observed mixed inhibition pattern versus phosphate suggests incomplete overlap at the PEP-pi she. Hybrid 4 represents the first example of an IV-alkyl glyphosate analog that exhibits a low micromolar interaction with EPSPS. A direct quantitative comparison is difficult given the uncompetitive nature of glyphosate inhibition versus S3P.73 `Ihe steric and ionic limitations of the glyphosate binding site have been well characterized versus PEP.32 As an EPSPS inhibitor class, modifications in glyphosate structure are not well

tolerated by this enzyme. Typically, N-substitution dramatically decmases the potency of glyphosate analog binding.32 For example, N-iso-propyl-PMG exhibits dramatically reduced affinity (Ki > 200 pM). In such cases, the added steric interactions presumably decrease the overall stability of the glyphosate ternaty complex with S3P; whereas with 4, significantly stronger binding is observed.

In summary, 4 represents the first example of a low micromolar EPSPS inhibitor based on the glyphosate ternary complex. Hybrid 4 bids competitively to EPSPS at the S3P/EPSP sites signticandy more tightly than S-amino-S3P (Ki = 85 pM)33 and at least as well as S3P (IQ = 8 pM).9 Hybrid 4 has little, if any, interaction at the PMG-phosphonate or PEP-Pi sites. Such an interaction has been demonstrated to account for the observed potency of 5 as an EPSPS bisubstrate inhibitor. Hybrid 4 appears to be too short to teach the expected glyphosate phosphonate binding site. This would require a much more extended PMG conformation. A comparison of the kinetic properties of 4 versus 5 suggests that the two molecules display dramaticaUy different binding properties. This difference provides the fast evidence that glyphosate and PEP are not super-imposable in a shortened, "pinched" conformation covalently bound to S3P. This evidence therefore suggests that glyphosate may not be bound in a "pinched" conformation. Therefore, glyphosate may rwtfuncrion the moLmdar level ar a transition at state analog of the putative PEP oxonium ion as originally proposed.7 Efforts are underway to corrobroate these results by better defining the key interactions of 4 with enzyme, particularly at the PEP-Pi site.
