Effect of Z-DNA

on Nucleosome Placement

Mark M. Garner and Gary Felsenfeld
Laboratory of Molecular Biology National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases National Institutes of Health Bethesda, MD 20892, U.S.A. (Received 26 November 1986, and in revised form 12 March 1987) Histone octamers were reconstituted on plasmids carrying the alternating nucleotide sequence (G-C),,. The plasmids, radioactively labeled at one of two neighboring sites near the (G-C) insert, were digested with micrococcal nuclease. Nucleosome core particles were isolated and the monomer DNA subjected to restriction analysis. Quite different results are obtained if the reconstitution is carried out with relaxed plasmids, in which the (G-C) insert, is in the B form, or with supercoiled plasmids, where it is in the Z form. With supercoiled plasmids, there is a marked reduction (compared with relaxed plasmids) in the abundance of labeled monomers, the result of a large decrease in core particles carrying any (G-C) sequence. Some core particles formed on supercoiled (2) plasmids are positioned either just outside the (G-C) sequence, or with the sequenceoccupying the terminal position within the core particle. In contrast, monomers obtained from relaxed plasmids incorporate the (G-C) sequence in the B form more or less randomly in the interior of the core particle; species showing discrete positioning make only a minor contribution. We conclude that DNA in the Z form cannot be incorporated within core particles, except at their termini, and that a transition from the B to the 2 form in vivo might result in a significantly altered local placement of nucleosomes.

Since a Certain other DNA sequences or structures do principal function of nucleosomes is to compact not appear to be at all capable of incorporation into DNA, it is not surprising that they should be nucleosomes. For example, the non-alternating capable of forming on a wide variety of DNA sequence poly[(dA). (dT)] does not form nucleosequences.

Figure 1. Partial restriction map of pGC90 in the region containing the (G-C) insert. Numbering is on the non-coding strand relative to the PvuII site corresponding to 2067 in pBR322. Vector sequence data are from Vieira & Messing (1982) and Yanisch-Perron et al. (1985). The heavy line corresponds to the (G-C),, insert. The asterisks indicate the position of labeling. more, the disposition of negatively charged phosphodiester groups on the DNA surface is quite different in the two forms, presumably presenting in the case of the 2 form another impediment to the assembly of a folded nucleoprotein particle. Nonetheless, it has been reported (Miller et al., 1985) that under some circumstances a compact particle containing Z-DNA can be obtained, in apparent contradiction of our previous results. In this paper, we extend our earlier studies by examining the incorporation within nucleosomes of a 30 bp segment of poly[(dG)-(dC)] contained in a plasmid. We show that when the plasmid is relaxed, nucleosome core particles derived from the reconstituted nucleohistone complexes contain the amount of (dG-dC) expected for random incorporation. However, if the plasmid is first supercoiled so that the G-C segment is in the 2 form, that segment is largely excluded from the nucleosome core population, or appears in the terminal sequences of the core particles.

Plasmid pGC90 was constructed by blunt-end ligation of oligomeric poly[(dG)-(dC)J (average size 30 t,o 100 bp) into pUC8 cut with HincII. The resulting plasmid was transformed into CaCl,-shocked Escherichia coli HBlOl and a colony having only monomer plasmid was selected (a partial restriction map of this construct is shown in Fig. 1). The size of the alternating G-C insert is 30 bp. Plasmid was prepared by the alkaline/sodium dodecyl sulfate method (Maniatis et aZ., 1982), banded t,wice on CsCl density-gradients, treated with ribonuclease A and then re-banded on a CsCl gradient., extracted with a 1 : 1 (v/v) mixture of phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dialyzed into the appropriate buffer for storage. (a) Plasmid labeling

Samples of pGC90 were cut with an excess of the appropriate restriction endonuclease. The linearized plasmids were end-labeled by the exchange reaction of phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia P-L) using [y-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol : Maniatis et al., 1982). They were then re-circularized at a concentration of 3.2 nMplasmid for 15 h at 14°C in the presence of 120 units of phage T4 DNA ligase/ml (Kew England Biolabs). The plasmids were supercoiled using avian erythrocyte nicking-closing extract (Camerini-Otero & Felsenfeld. 1977) and ethidium bromide sufficient to give the desired level of supercoiling, followed by purification on CsCl density-gradients. For experiments involving relaxed plasmid, a portion of the labeled supercoiled plasmid was re-treated with nicking-closing extract in the absence of ethidium bromide. To ensure that all of the plasmid was supercoiled sufficiently, 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Peck & Wang (1983: and see Fig. 2).

(b) Histones The 4 core histones were isolated from adult chicken erythrocytes by the column chromatographic method of Simon & Felsenfeld (1979) with the modification that, after the initial column wash to remove Hl and nonhistone chromosomal proteins, the 4 core proteins were eluted together by washing the column with 2 M-NaCl, concentrated. dialyzed into distilled water, and stored frozen. Histone concentrations were determined as described by Stein (1979). XDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to show that all the histones were present in equal amounts and were undegraded. Histone-DNA reconstitutions were performed by salt/urea dialysis (Camerini-Otero & Felsenfeld, 1977) at concentrations of 50 pg DNA/ml and 10 pg histories/ml (3 mol histone octamer/l mol plasmid). It is necessary to perform the reconstitution at a low histone to DNA ratio to limit the number of histone octamers per plasmid. High numbers of nucleosomes would relieve the torsional stress in the portion of the plasmid remaining uncomplexed. This, in turn, would cause a transition of the (G-C) region from the 2 to the B form. After the final dialysis, a sample of the reconstitute was treated with nicking-closing extract. deproteinized, and then electrophoresed on a 1.0% (w/v) agarose gel in 40 mlvr-Tris base. 1 mM-EDTA to determine the 30 mM-NaH,PO,, extent of reconstitution. CaCl, was added to the remainder to a final concentration of I.0 mM, and the complex then digested with micrococcal nuclease (CooperWorthington: typically. 1.3 units/ml for 20 min at 37°C). The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA and EGTA to 5 mM, unlabeled chicken erythrocyte nucleosome cores were added to a concentration of 50 pg/ml, and the samples were layered onto isokinetic sucrose density-gradients (McCarthy et al., 1974) containing 50 mM-NaCl, 10 mw-Tris . HCl (pH 8), 0.1 mM-EDTA (Nick01 et aE., 1982) and centrifuged in an SW40 rotor at 4°C for 22 h at 35,000 revs/min. The gradients were fractionated, the radioactive peak fractions co-migrating with nucleosome cores were pooled and, after dialysis to remove the sucrose, the sample was deproteinized as described by Shindo et al. (1980). The resulting DNA was digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases at 37°C for 60 min and then electrophoresed on 0.08 cm x 16 cm x 20 cm, 100/b polyacrylamide gels (30 : 1 (w/w) acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in Tris-borate/EDTA (Maniatis et al., 1982) for 15 h at 40 V. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XBR-omat X-ray film using a DuPont-Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screen at - 80°C. Densitometry was performed on a Hoefer GS300 scanning densitometer.

3. Results
Reconstitution of a low loading of histones onto plasmid pGC90 results in a non-co-operative distribution of nucleosomes among plasmid molecultes. As shown in Figure 3, a relaxation reaction, which assays for the number of superhelical turns induced by nucleosome formation in the closed circular DNA, demonstrates that the histones appear evenly distributed over the plasmid population. Furthermore, the histones reconstitute to an equal extent on both supercoiled and relaxed plasmid, as would be expected if the extent of reconstitution was limited by the amount of protein

present. The mean number of nucleosomes per plasmid is close to 3, the input ratio. If such reconstitutes on pGC90 labeled at the BamHI site are digested with micrococcal nuclease and the deproteinized DNA is analyzed on a polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4, left), the only band seen upon staining with ethidium bromide in both supercoiled DNA ((G-C) insert in the Z form) and relaxed DNA ((G-C) in the B form) is a sharp band approximately 145 bp long, the expected size for DNA from properly folded nucleosome core particles. The amounts of monomer DNA are equal, consistent with the relaxation assay showing equal reconstitution in both. However, autoradiography of this gel (Fig. 4, right) shows that the 145 bp band from the relaxed reconstitute contains much more radioactive label than the band derived from the supercoiled reconstitute. Since equal amounts of total monomer DNA and equal amounts of radioactivity were loaded on the gel, the relative deficit of radioactivity in nucleosomal DNA (when the DNA is supercoiled and the (G-C) sequence is in the 2 form) must represent an avoidance of the labeled site by histones. Note t,hat, a smaller fraction of the monomer DNA in the supercoiled reconstitute is trimmed precisely to the 145 bp length seen as the major component in both the bulk DNA and relaxed reconstitute; the supercoiled reconstitute yields a considerable amount of monomer DNA that is 165 bp long. To ensure that the DNA examined in Figure 4 was from properly reconstituted nucleosomes, micrococcal nuclease-digested reconstitutes were

After the final dialysis of the reconstitution procedure, CaCl, and micrococcal nuclease were added to 1 InM and 1.3 units/ml, respectively, and the reactions were incubated at 37 "C for 20 min, followed by deproteinization with proteinase K/SDS/lithium acetate, extraction with phenol, and precipitation with ethanol. The samples were then electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in Tris-borate/EDTA for 16 h at 40 V, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed (left panel), dried, and autoradiographed (right panel).

Figure 5. Sucrose density-gradient profile. Following with micrococcal nuclease, histone-DNA digestion reconstitutions performed on supercoiled plasmids (continuous line) or relaxed plasmids (broken line) labeled at the BumHI site were layered on isokinetic 5% to 269% (w/w) sucrose gradients and spun at 35,000 revs/min for 22 h in an SW40 rotor. Migration is from right t,o left. Each fraction is 0.33 ml in volume. which represents an increment of 0.5 S. After fractionation, the gradients were counted for Cerenkov radiation. The arrow represents the position of chicken erythrocyte monomers in a similar gradient.

centrifuged through isokinetic sucrose densitygradients. Fractionation profiles of such gradients for plasmids labeled at the BamHI site (Fig. 5) show distinct peaks of radioactivity that sediment at 11 S, the appropriate sedimentation coefficient for properly reconstituted nucleosomes. The remainder of the radioactivity, which is not into nucleosomes and is therefore incorporated digested to small fragments, is found near the top of the gradient. Essentially all (> 90%) of the input radioactive label was recovered either as 11 S particle or at the top of the gradient. The amount of radioactivity in the monomer peak from a reconstitution on relaxed plasmid (in which the (G-C) insert is in the B form) is approximately what would be expected if the distribution of histones on the plasmid is random; the gradient profile of an experiment performed on supercoiled equivalent in plasmid shows about 40% as much radioactivity the monomer peak, even though equal amounts of radioactivity were loaded on each gradient and, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, the extent of reconstitution is equal for both. This indicates that the H

form insert is at least 2.5 times more likely to form nucleosomes compared to the 2 form. Gradients performed on plasmids labeled at the Hind111 site give similar profiles (not shown). To determine the precise location of nucleosomes around the labeled sites, the 11 S peak from supercoiled and relaxed plasmid reconstitutes, labeled at either the BamHI or Hind111 sites, was pooled, deproteinized, and analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion. An autoradiograph from a polyacrylamide gel run on these digests is shown in Figure 6. For the BamHI-labeled plasmids, the unrestricted DNA appears similar to the monomer DNA seen in Figure 4. In this case, the monomer DNA fractions from both the supercoiled and relaxed plasmids (lanes A and D, respectively) contain, in addition to the 145 bp component, a smear of additional material extending upwards as high as 165 bp, although shorter autoradiographic exposures show that more of the 165 bp fragments are present in lane A. Digestion of the monomers from supercoiled (2) plasmids with HhaI, which cuts the sequence GCGC, results in approximately 40% of the radioactivity appearing in a relatively sharp band at about 136 bp (lane B). Since this is visible on the autoradiograph, it must contain the labeled BamHI site. This could arise only from a nucleosome that is rather tightly phased adjacent to, or slightly invading, the (G-C) stretch. Much of the "core" DNA larger than 145 bp that is seen in

Deproteinized nucleosomal DNA, derived from micrococcal nuclease digests of reconstitutes on supercoiled or relaxed plasmids, was digested with the indicated enzyme for 1 h at 37"C, EDTA was added, and the reactions were loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed as described in the text. After drying, the gel was subjected to autoradiography at - 70°C with 1 intensifying screen. The marker lanes are H&I-digested pBR322. Lanes A to F.

lane A of Figure 6 and in lane b of Figure 4 probably reflects the relative resistance of the (G-C) insert to attack by micrococcal nuclease, which et al., 1986). prefers A+T-rich sequences (Flick A core particle "snuggled up" to or slightly invading the insert could then contain 145 bp of the core DNA plus a nuclease-resistant (G-C) "tail". A diagram of this monomer DNA species and its restriction digest products, and diagrams of other species discussed below, are given in Figure 7, and the placement of the monomers with respect to the DNA sequence is shown in Figure 8. A summary of the species derived from supercoiled plasmids, and their abundance, is given in Table 1. The yields shown are for the experiment in Figure 6; some variation in the relative abundance of species is observed when the reconstitution experiment is repeated. When the monomer DNA from the supercoiled, BamHI-labeled plasmid is cleaved with HpaII fragment about 36 bp long is (lane C), a labeled obtained, again containing about 40% of the starting radioactivity. An examination of the restriction map shows that this can only be the (G-C) stretch and the eight base-pairs between it and the HpaII cleavage site, which is adjacent to

the labeled position. The other cleavage fragment is not labeled. The results are once more consistent with a structure in which the (G-C) sequence is at the end of the intact monomer structure (upper left, Fig. 7; subfraction Al, Table 1). The HpaII fragment presumably comes from the longer monomer components in which the (G-C) segment protrudes beyond the core particle. Although it is possible, in principle, that the fragment could arise from cleavage of the shorter monomer DNA species, this seems unlikely, since a 145 bp fragment ending in about 30 bp of (G-C) should have produced a strong 115 bp fragment upon digestion with HhaI. As noted above, 40% of the labeled monomer DNA is converted into 136 bp DNA by digestion with HhaI. The remainder of the DNA is presumably smeared too much to be seen readily on the autoradiograph. A conservative interpretation requires the assumption that all of this DNA might have the (G-C) sequence randomly placed within the nucleosome. As will be explained below, most of this material comes from nicked plasmids, in which the (G-C) insert is in the B form. When this is taken into account, only 18% of the monomer DNA from supercoiled plasmids is found to contain internally placed (G-C) (subfraction A3, Table 1). In contrast

In each panel, the top line shows a phased monomer DNA component, as deduced from the sizes of the radioactively labeled restriction digest fragments shown immediately below. The asterisk in each case marks the sit,e of labelings at the BumHI site (left panels) or Hind111 site (right panels). The plasmid DNA used in reconstitution was either supercoiled to drive the (G-C) insert (zig-zag line) into the Z form (top panels) or relaxed so that the insert was in the B form (bottom panels). The monomer product in the upper left panel is subfraction A 1 in Table 1. The upper right panel shows subfraction Bl. Two other species arising from phasing on relaxed plasmids are discussed in the text but not explicitly shown here. (1) A monomer extending from nucleotides 378 to 523, which just includes the BumHI-labeled site at one end. This phasing is similar to that shown for supercoiled DNA in the upper right panel.

sufficiently DNA (see

the 70 bp HhaI band and the 90 bp HpaII band are consistent with the presence of a phased nucleosome extending from about 437 to about 580 bp, which contains the (G-C) insert near the center of the core. This is indicated in Figure 7 (lower left), and as subfraction Cl in Figure 8. The small amounts of 136 bp DNA and 36 bp DNA found after digestion with HhaI and HpaII, respectively, are consistent with a second phased position, identical to that which predominates in the supercoiled plasmid (lanes B and C; upper left panel, Fig. 7; subfraction Al, Table l), but of much lower abundance. The 145 bp DNA remaining after digestion with HpaII (lane F) must arise from a third phasing, in which histone octamers cover nucleotides 378 to 523 or slightly longer. These are positioned with all of the (G-C) sequence just within the 145 bp fragment, with one end just covering the labeled site but not extending much beyond the HpuII site. All of the bands in lanes E and F of Figure 7 are weak relative to the monomer band in lane D. Thus, although t'hese results show that histone octamers can occupy preferred positions, most of the monomers obtained from the relaxed plasmids must derive from randomly placed octamers. The reconstitution experiments were repeated with a supercoiled plasmid labeled at the Hind111 site (Fig. 1). The restriction analysis of monomers derived from this plasmid shows that placement of histone octamers is altered when the (G-C) insert is in the 2 form. In this case, the monomer (lane G) has an average size of about 142 to 145 bp. When this DNA is treated with HhaI (lane H), a major portion is uncut or reduced by 2 to 3 bp in size, indicating that (G-C) sequences are essentially absent from a large fraction of these molecules.

Some of the monomer fraction is converted into a smear (with some evidence of a banding pattern) directly below the initial band, with a range of sizes about 10 to 25 bp smaller. The DNA molecules in the smear must arise from monomers in which the nucleosome core has invaded the terminal 10 to 15 bp of the (G-C) sequence in a somewhat loosely phased structure. The identity of this DNA is confirmed by digestion of the monomer DNA with HaeIII, which yields fragments (23% of the total) in the size range of 73 to 80 bp, appropriate for monomers containing about 19 to 26 bp of the (G-C) insert within one end (Bl, Table 1; upper right panel, Fig. 7). The fact that there is no 54 bp fragment present in the HaeIII digest shows that, in this case, there is no structure in which the (G-C) sequence is located just outside the core particle. The DNA contained in the 145 bp band and the smear below it, obtained by digestion with HhaT (lane H), constitutes 80% of the total monomer shown in lane G (Bl plus B2, Table 1). We will assume that the remaining 20%, which cannot be detected on the gel, must be associated with internally placed (G-C) pairs (B2, Table 1). Since the overall yield of labeled monomers from supercoiled plasmids is 40% that from relaxed plasmids, the number of monomers with internal (G-C) pairs derived from supercoiled plasmids is 8 y. of the total monomer yield obtained from the relaxed form. If nucleosome placement had been random, as it appears to be for most of the population derived from relaxed plasmids, then about 50% of the labeled monomers would have contained the (G-C) insert at non-terminal positions within the 145 bp fragment. The presence of 2 DNA thus reduces the abundance of such monomers at least sixfold. In confirmation of the results described above, monomers from relaxed (B form) HindTTT sitelabeled monomers show the same phasing seen for the BumHI-labeled plasmids, i.e. a phased nucleosome in the region 435 to 585 (Fig. 65 to I,, Fig. 7), incorporating the (G-C) string within t'he body of the core particle (Fig. 8, Cl ), and a second covering 378 to 523 (Fig. 8, C2). The uncut 145 bp fragment in Figure 6 lane K, comes from randomly phased nucleosomes that do not include the (G-C) string.

4. Discussion
Earlier work from this laboratory (Nick01 et al., 1982) showed that high molecular weight poly[(dG)(5MedC)] in the 2 conformation is not capable of forming nucleosome core particles in a histoneDNA reconstitution in vitro. The results presented here show that, when contained in a plasmid, a 30 bp insert of alternating (G-C) in the Z conformation largely excludes nucleosome formation, and in those core particles containing (G-C:), it is placed at the terminus. The most dramatic effects of supercoiling (and the accompanying transition to the 2 conformation) are a reduction In the overall yield of particles incorporating labeled sites near

588

M. M. Garner and G. Felsenfeld these particles are derived from nicked closed circles, presumably generated by radiolytic damage or during reconstitution. In nicked circles, the (G-C) insert is in the B form, and therefore capable of random placement within the nucleosome. It is possible to estimate this contribution by comparing, for example, the products of HpaII digestion of monomers from relaxed and supercoiled plasmids labeled at the BamHI site (Fig. 6, lanes C and F). The 145 and 90 bp fragments in lane F derive from monomers at two preferred octamer positions in the relaxed plasmid, as discussed above. The same two bands are seen faintly in digests of the supercoiled plasmid (lane C), and must reflect the presence of nicked circles. The 90 bp band in lane C is too diffuse for accurate measurement but, from the measured yield of the 145 bp band, we estimate that about 70% of the core particles from the supercoiled plasmid preparation that have internal (G-C) segments are derived from nicked circles. This corresponds to 40% of all core particles (A2, Table 1). It is difficult to prove that there are no monomers whatever with a centrally placed (G-C) insert and derived from intact supercoiled plasmids. If they do exist, they probably reflect the presence of a small supercoiled plasmid population containing the insert in the B form. As shown in Figure 2, a small fraction of labeled supercoiled plasmids are within one linking number of reverting to the B form under the solvent conditions used in running the gel. If the same were true under the solvent conditions of the reconstitution, then the first histone octamer to bind would cause a Z-B transition, and subsequent octamers could bind randomly with respect to the (G-C) sequence. However, the dependence of this transition varies with solvent conditions. At very low ionic strength, increasing salt concentration (e.g. to 0.1 M-NaCl) disfavors the Z form and a higher superhelical density is needed to maintain the (G-C) stretch in the 2 form (Peck & Wang, 1983), while at high ionic strength (> 1-O M-NaCl) this effect is reversed (Stirdivant et al., 1982). The transition between these two kinds of behavior has not been characterized. In any event, the ionic strength at which the histones become fixed in position during the reconstitution procedure is unknown. The observation that Z-DNA tends to be excluded from core particles is consistent with calculations of the free energy required to bend the DNA around the histone core. Following CameriniOtero & Felsenfeld (1977), we calculate the bending free energy in nucleosome core formation as AGsen, where r = L = R= = l/2 B (l/r)%, radius of curvature total contour length bending force constant.

the (G-C) insert (Figs 4 and 5) and a major change in the pattern of fragments produced by restriction of the core DNA (Fig. 6). Analysis of the restriction fragment pattern shows that, when it is in the Z form, the insert causes phasing of some neighboring nucleosomes. Two classes of phased nucleosomes are observed. In the first class, in which nucleosomes cover the BamHI site, the core is positioned at or near the edge of the (G-C) element; in the second, with cores covering the Hind111 site, about 20 bp of (G-C) are within the core, at its very end. The DNA at the ends of nucleosome cores is capable of undergoing reversible denaturation and separation from the surface of the particle (Weischet et al., 1978; Simpson, 1979; McGhee & Felsenfeld, 19806). McGhee & Felsenfeld (1980b) reported that 27 bp of DNA at each end formed relatively less stable interactions with the histone octamer. This might be the result of electrostatic repulsion between these termini and the preceding turn of DNA supercoil (which they overlap), or it might reflect a lower density of charge interactions between histones and DNA in the terminal regions. The terminal regions may therefore be able to accommodate a short Z-DNA segment that would disrupt the structure if it were located in the middle. Alternatively, the portion of (G-C) within the end of the core particle may be converted to the B form; perhaps a B-Z junction is maintained, or the entire sequence may be converted. It should be noted that two of the phased positions of nucleosomes from relaxed plasmids place the (G-C) segment just within the terminus or just outside the core. It is likely that the placement of (G-C) within the terminal sequences of core particles isolated from supercoiled plasmids depends also on the details of the adjacent nucleotide sequence. This would explain why histone octamers covering the labeled Hind111 site and positioned to the left of the (G-C) (see Fig. 1) incorporate the (G-C) sequence sequence, while those covering the BamHI site and positioned to the right do not. In interpreting these results it should be kept in mind that, although distinctly phased monomers are observed with Z-DNA positioned just within or outside the cores' termini, these are not the only species present. This is particularly obvious in the case of monomers from supercoiled plasmids labeled at the Hind111 site, where the majority of labeled 145 bp fragments arise from randomly placed nucleosomes that completely exclude the (G-C) insert (B2, Table 1). This effect is not apparent in monomers labeled at the BamHI site, as that site is quite close to the insert, and therefore slightly more distant nucleosomes are not labeled. A small number of core particles obtained from supercoiled plasmids contain the (G-C) insert at random locations in the interior of the core particle. The methods we have used only place an upper limit on their abundance. In the case of the supercoiled BamHI-labeled plasmid, the majority of

The bending force constant is taken as RT times the persistence length (Landau & Lifshitz, 1958). In these calculations, we use the high-salt limit (charge screened) values of the persistence length, since the

charges on the DNA in a nucleosome are partially screened by the positive charges on the histones. Using persistence lengths for B and Z-DNA from Thomas & Bloomfield (1983), and assuming 145 bp of DNA in the core particle, regardless of DNA conformationt, we calculate (1 cal = 4.184 J): all B-DNA: AC,,,, 115 bp B + 30 bp 2: AG,,,, all Z-DNA: AC,,,, = + 13 kcal/mol; = + 32 kcal/mol; = + 105 kcal/mol.

Clearly, a considerable amount of additional free energy is needed to form a nucleosome containing 30 bp of Z-DNA. These calculations are based on the assumption that the DNA is uniformly bent around the histone octamer. Crystallographic results (Richmond et al., 1984) show discontinuities in the bending of the DNA; nevertheless, it is probable that no segment of the DNA is sufficiently unbent to be able to accommodate a 30 bp segment of "stiff" (i.e. unbent) DNA. DNA bending ability is not, of course, the sole criterion for nucleosome formation. Given the conformational differences between B and 2, it seems unlikely that the positively charged groups on the histone octamer that interact directly with the DNA will be able to accommodate the negative charge distribution on Z-DNA. The "zig-zag" array of phosphate groups in Z-DNA would certainly be "out of register" with respect to the histone charges, making formation of a stable nucleosome structure less likely. We do not know if the phasing seen on the relaxed plasmids arises from a requirement that the 30 bp (G-C) insert be accommodated at a particular position in the core particle or from some property of the sequences flanking the insert. This phasing, in any event, represents only a local energy minimum, since only a small fraction of the plasmid molecules in a reconstitute have a core particle located in the neighborhood of the insert. The important point is that nucleosomes are capable of incorporating the (G-C) sequence in their interior when it is in the B form, but not when it is in the Z form. Our results are at variance with those of Miller et al. (1985), who reported that they could prepare nucleosome cores containing the Z form of poly[(dG)-(5meC)]. Our analysis of their sucrose density-gradient profiles, using the equations given t We assume that the bending free energies of the components in the B-Z copolymer are additive, and that an all-2 core particle would contain 145 bp. Keeping 145 bp in the nucleosome results, for the case of all-Z-DNA, in an increase in contour length (and therefore AC,) of approximately 8%. Constraining the contour length to be equal to the B-DNA nucleosome would mean - 12 fewer bp in the core particle, possibly resulting in a loss of ionic interactions between the DNA and histone octamer and therefore destabilizing the nucleosome. In either case, the calculations clearly show that the free energy involved in Z-DNA nucleosome formation is much larger than for B-DNA nucleosomes.

by McEwen (1967) and the sedimentation coefficient standard shown in the gradient profile, indicates that the sedimentation coefficient (So,,,,) of the histone-DNA complexes they describe is approximately 8.2 S, which corresponds to an unfolded particle, and not a compact nucleosomelike structure. This is exactly the result that would be predicted from the calculations presented above, and from our earlier data (Nick01 et al., 1982). Although histones may protect more or lessdiscrete lengths of the left-handed duplex from nuclease attack, it is too costly in energy to fold the stiff ZDNA around the histone octamer. The extent to which DNA adopts the Z form in viva is an unsettled issue. However, it seemscertain that only relatively short stretches of DNA will exist in the 2 form in the cell. The results presented here demonstrate that even such relatively short regions could give rise to an altered pattern of nucleosome placement. Short segments of potential Z-DNA are found, for example, within the SV40 enhancer (Nordheim & Rich, 1983; Hagen et aE., 1985). The region is nucleosome-free (Varshavsky et al., 1981; Scott & Wigmore, 1978) and, although it is unlikely that this is attributable directly to the presence of Z-DNA, it is possible that formation of Z-DNA has a more subtle effect on nucleosome placement. Our results in any case provide an example of a way in which change in local DNA conformation, influenced by supercoiling, can affect chromatin organization. Another example is provided by the supercoil-driven formation of hairpin structures, which results in exclusion of nucleosomes (Nick01 & Martin, 1983; Nobile et al., 1986). As noted by Weintraub (1983), there may be
a wide variety of anomalous DNA conformations

that can perturb chromatin structure. Most non-BDNA conformations are likely to have both an altered twist and a reduced ability to enter the nucleosome. In principle, all such structures should have an effect on nucleosome placement tha,t is coupled to the level of supercoiling.
