ABSTRACT: The mating type homeodomain proteins, MATa1 and MATR2, combine to form a heterodimer to bind DNA in diploid yeast cells. The a1-R2 heterodimer tightly and specifically binds haploid-specific gene operators to repress transcription. On its own, however, the a1 homeodomain does not bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. To help understand this interaction, we describe the solution structure and backbone dynamics of the free a1 homeodomain. Free a1 in solution is an ensemble of structures having flexible hinges at the two turns in the small protein fold. Conformational changes in the a1 homeodomain upon ternary complex formation are located in the loop between helix 1 and helix 2, where the C-terminal tail of R2 binds to form the heterodimer, and at the C-terminus of helix 3, the DNA recognition helix. The observed differences, comparing the free and bound a1 structures, suggest a mechanism linking van der Waals stacking changes to the ordering of a final turn in the DNA-binding helix of a1. The tail of R2 induces changes in loop 1 of a1 that push it toward a properly folded DNA binding conformation.

Transcription factors containing the homeodomain DNAbinding motif have been found in eukaryotic species from yeast to human (1). The homeodomain consists of 60 amino acids that fold into three helices with an unstructured N-terminal arm. Crystallographic (2-8) and NMR1 spectroscopic (9-11) studies of homeodomain-DNA complexes have revealed a general model of DNA recognition (12) among homeodomains involving DNA contacts in the major and minor grooves via the third helix and the N-terminal arm, respectively. Homeodomain proteins bind with relatively low sequence specificity and affinity in vitro (13). Despite their conserved protein fold, their mode of DNA binding, and their modest affinity for DNA, homeodomain proteins achieve a range of extremely specific regulatory actions that lead to precise developmental outcomes in vivo. To achieve the specific functionality that leads to tightly regulated gene expression in vivo, homeodomain motifs are often flanked by adjacent amino acid sequences that mediate protein-protein interactions, providing combinatorial advantages for recognition and affinity. For instance, the HOX proteins contain a characteristic YPWM sequence found N-terminal to their homeodomain which has been shown (7,

8) to mediate protein-protein interactions in both the human Pbx1-HoxB1 and the Drosophila Ubx-Exd complexes. The Saccharomyces cereVisiae homeodomain MATR2, or R2, has two regions flanking its homeodomain for protein-protein interactions important in entirely separate functions. In both R and a-R yeast cell types, an N-terminal sequence of R2 interacts with the MCM1 protein, leading to repression of a-specific haploid genes (14-16). In diploid a-R cells, the C-terminal tail of R2 binds the MATa1, or a1, homeodomain to form a heterodimer that recognizes haploid-specific gene (hsg) operators (4, 17-19). The a1-R2 heterodimer recruits the SSN6-TUP1 complex, which represses transcription of the haploid-specific genes (20). These genetic, biochemical, and structural studies show that homeodomains can use specific protein-protein combinations to achieve functional versatility. The yeast a1 protein, however, is distinct among wellstudied homeodomains. Whereas the R2 monomer alone can bind DNA with modest affinity, the a1 monomer shows no sequence-specific DNA binding in vitro (18, 19). But in combination, the a1-R2 heterodimer is 3000 times more specific for hsg operators than for nonspecific DNA (18). Recent studies (21, 22) have shown that a1 provides the majority of the DNA specificity and affinity for the a1-R2 heterodimer. Indeed, Vershon and co-workers (23) have shown that an R2 variant, with alanine substituting for residues that make base-specific DNA contacts, can still repress transcription in complex with a1. The a1 protein has a homeodomain motif at its C-terminus with no adjacent, flanking sequences for protein-protein interactions identified to date. The C-terminal segment of the protein (a166-126) has been identified as the minimal fragment that is able to heterodimerize and bind tightly to

10046 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 33, 2000 DNA, with only a 10-fold reduction in DNA affinity relative to that of the intact protein (19). Previous NMR (24) and crystallographic studies (4) demonstrate that this minimal, functional fragment of the a1 protein has a classical homeodomain fold. The ternary complex (a1-R2-hsg operator) structure (4) demonstrates that the a1 homeodomain makes extensive DNA contacts using its third helix, but the N-terminal arm is disordered in the crystal and does not make the minor groove contacts characteristic of homeodomain proteins. Structural studies have shown that the a1-R2 heterodimer is formed both in the absence (24) and in the presence of DNA (4). Heterodimerization involves the formation of a helix in the C-terminal tail of R2 that contacts a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the a1 homeodomain. Recently, Stark et al. (22) have demonstrated that even the isolated R2 C-terminal tail peptide can convert a1 from a weak to a strong DNA-binding protein. This finding suggests that the changes in the a1 homeodomain dictated by the R2 C-terminal tail underlie the high affinity and specificity of the a1-R2 heterodimer for its DNA targets. Using NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the solution structure and described the backbone dynamics of the functional a1 homeodomain fragment, a166-126. Free a1 in solution may be most accurately described as an ensemble of structures having flexible hinges at the two turns in the small protein fold. When free a1 is compared with the bound form determined crystallographically, conformational changes upon ternary complex formation are located in the loop between helix 1 (H1) and helix 2 (H2), where the C-terminal helical peptide of R2 binds, and at the C-terminus of the third helix (H3), the DNA recognition helix. The interaction of the R2 tail causes rearrangements of side chains in the loop structure of a1. The effects of these changes may reduce the flexibility in the a1 homeodomain structure, effectively reducing the entropic barrier for subsequent DNA binding by the a1-R2 heterodimer. MATERIALS AND METHODS NMR Measurements. The a1 homeodomain was overexpressed and purified as previously described (25). NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on Bruker Avance DRX 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers. Uniformly labeled ([U-15N] or [U-15N,13C]) protein samples were dissolved in 25 mM deuterated acetate (pH 4.5), 100 mM KCl, and 0.01% NaN3. DSS was added as the internal chemical shift standard. Spectra were processed using FELIX 970 (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Complete backbone and 97% of the side chain proton resonance assignments for the a1 homeodomain are supplied in the Supporting Information and will be deposited in the BioMagResBank at University of Wisconsin. For the assignment of NOEs, 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC, methyl-methyl 13C-13C NOESY (26), and two-dimensional NOESY spectra, collected at 100 ms, were used. WATERGATE pulses (27) were used for water suppression. The three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiment was recorded as a 1024 × 256 × 96 complex matrix, with eight scans and a recycle time of 1.5 s. The methyl-methyl NOESY experiment was recorded as a 1024 × 152 × 38 complex matrix, with 16 scans and a recycle time of 1.5 s. The twodimensional experiment was collected as a 4096 × 1024 complex matrix, with 32 scans and a recycle time of 1.5 s.

Anderson et al. A series of 1H-15N correlation spectra were collected at 500 MHz to determine the backbone 15N longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rate constants and the steadystate NOE. Pulse sequences used to measure relaxation rates have been described previously (28) using the PEP-Z modification. For R1 experiments, relaxation delays of 17.3 (×2), 207 (×2), 345, 518, 777, and 2500 (×2) ms were used (duplicate acquisitions noted by ×2). For R2 experiments, relaxation delays of 8.14 (×2), 16.29 (×2), 24.43 (×2), 32.58 (×2), 40.71, 57.01, 73.30, 146.59 (×2), 171.02, 219.88, and 472.35 (×2) ms were used. The interval between the refocusing pulses in the 15N CPMG sequence was 1 ms. 1H15N steady-state NOE values were determined from interleaved two-dimensional spectra recorded with and without a 3 s presaturation pulse in addition to a 3 s relaxation delay, resulting in a 6 s recycle time. Spectra were recorded in a 2048 × 256 complex matrix. For each t1 increment, 32 scans were acquired. For all spectra, an exponential line broadening function was applied in 2; shifted sine bell functions were used to apodize data in 1. Relaxation Data Analysis. Individual peak heights were measured using FELIX macros written by M. Akke (Lund University, Lund, Sweden) and supplied by A. G. Palmer (Columbia University, New York, NY). Uncertainties in peak heights were estimated from duplicate spectra as described previously (28). R1 and R2 values were extracted using nonlinear, least-squares fitting of the experimental peak heights versus time using monoexponential functions provided in software packages by A. G. Palmer (Columbia University) or in Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). The model-free formalism was used to relate the relaxation parameters to the spectral density function of the NH bond vector. The relaxation rates, R1 and R2, for an amide 15N nucleus are dominated by dipolar interaction with the directly attached proton and by chemical shift anisotropy (29):

for which the constants d ) (µ0hHN/82)rNH3 and c ) N/ 3, where µ0 is the permittivity of free space, h is Plank's constant, H and N are the gyromagnetic ratios of the proton and the nitrogen nucleus, respectively, H and N are the 1H and 15N Larmor frequencies, respectively, rNH is the internuclear 1H-15N distance (1.02 Å), and  (-160 ppm) is the chemical shift anisotropy measured for 15N nuclei by Hiyama et al. (30) Exchange contributions to R2 due to conformational averaging on the microsecond to millisecond time scale are treated by adding a third term, Rex, to eq 2. Analysis of the relaxation data within the model-free formalism was performed using the Modelfree program (version 3.1), kindly provided by A. G. Palmer, and described in previously published procedures (31). Initial estimates of the overall correlation time, m, were obtained from the 10% trimmed mean of the R1/R2 ratio. Model selection was carried out as described by Mandel et al. (31). Structure Calculations. To compare our results with the current homeodomain literature, the amino acid residues

Structure and Dynamics of the a1 Homeodomain of a1 were renumbered from the previous system of 66126 (24) to -3 to 57. A preliminary set of NOEs was assigned from both 15N-edited and homonuclear NOESY spectra. Five categories were used: strong (1.8-2.7 Å), medium (1.8-3.5 Å), weak (1.8-5.0 Å), very weak (1.86.0 Å), and extremely weak (1.8-8.0 Å for methyl-methyl NOEs or NOEs involving aromatic HD* or HE* protons). For 3JHNHR values of >8, torsion angle restraints for the dihedral angle  were set equal to -120 ( 60°. For 3JHNHR values of <6,  was calculated using the Karplus relation with constants A, B, and C being equal to 6.51, -1.76, and 1.60, respectively, and the restraint was given an uncertainty of (30°. No restraints were used for residues with intermediate 3JHNHR values. Hydrogen bond restraints were included for those identified by slow hydrogen exchange rates in earlier work (24). This set of 615 NOEs, 38 dihedral angle restraints, and 42 hydrogen bond restraints were used in an X-PLOR (32) refinement to produce a cluster of medium-resolution structures. A representative structure of this cluster was selected as a starting conformation for an abbreviated ARIA (32) calculation where any remaining unassigned peaks from the two-dimensional and three-dimensional data sets and proton chemical shift assignments described above were calibrated and assigned in a single iteration of ARIA. Both the unambiguous and the ambiguous ARIA assignments were examined for possible inclusion in subsequent X-PLOR calculations using the following criteria. Any ARIA assignment contributing at least 40% to the peak intensity and having a distance between assigned protons of e7 Å was included in an additional group of NOEs to be added to the previous list of NOEs. This enlarged set of NOEs and the dihedral angle and hydrogen bond restraints were cycled through several XPLOR calculations. After each calculation, NOE violations were identified with the program AQUA (33). Any NOE which was violated by an average of g0.10 Å was reduced in strength or deleted from the set if no further reductions in strength were possible. The final set of 1178 NOE connectivities consisted of 283 intraresidue, 350 sequential, 380 medium-range, and 165 long-range NOEs, or an average of 24.0 NOE restraints per structured residue (residues 8-56). Structure refinement was based on unambiguously assigned NOEs, 42 hydrogen bonds, and 38 scalar coupling constants (3JHNHR). One hundred random structures were generated in XPLOR using the parallhdg.pro parameter file supplied with ARIA as it had more precise values of bond lengths and bond angles than the original parameter file supplied with X-PLOR, and standard distance geometry and simulated annealing calculations were performed. The 100 final structures were analyzed with the program NMRCLUST (34). Sixty-six conformations formed a cluster with a rmsd of 0.338 Å for backbone atoms of residues 11-53. The 20 lowest-energy conformations of the 100 final structures were selected to represent the final ensemble of solution structures of a1. These structures had an rmsd of 0.264 Å and target function values ranging from 114.4 to 129.2 kcal/mol. NMRCLUST also identified one of the 20 to be the most representative of the cluster of low-energy conformations. The structure coordinates (1F43) and NMR constraint files are deposited at the Protein Data Bank.

RESULTS Resonance Assignments. The a1 homeodomain was expressed and purified using the dnaY system described previously (25). The amino acid sequence is shown in Figure 1 and is aligned with the sequences of the Oct-1, engrailed (en), Antennapedia (Antp), and MATR2 homeodomains. Mass spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the [U-99.5%15N] and [U-95%15N,13C] proteins, including an N-terminal methionine, were correctly expressed and free of posttranslational modifications or oxidation. The majority of backbone amide chemical shift assignments was reported previously (24) for the folded residues of the a1 homeodomain. Complete sequence-specific assignments for all amide protons in the protein construct, residues -3 to 57 (Figure 1), coexpressed with dnaY (25) are reported in the Supporting Information. In addition, 97% of the side chain protons for residues 9-57 (fragment numbering scheme) have been assigned. For many cases, methylene protons for the longer chain amino acids are overlapped. Structure Calculations. From the NMR data sets, 615 NOEs, 38 dihedral angle restraints, and 42 hydrogen bond restraints were generated for initial model building. To expand the set of input data, we used the ARIA program (35) to help assign ambiguous NOE resonances as described in Materials and Methods. The final set (Table 1) of 1178 NOEs consisted of 283 intraresidue, 350 sequential, 380 medium-range, and 165 long-range NOEs, or an average of 24 NOE restraints per structured residue (residues 8-56). This enlarged set of NOE connectivities, along with the dihedral angle and hydrogen bond restraints reported previously (24), was cycled through several X-PLOR (32) calculations to refine the three-dimensional structure. The sequence folds into three helices separated by a loop and a turn. The N-terminal arm residues (Lys 3-Ser 7) are unstructured as are residues 54-57 at the C-terminal end of

FIGURE 2: Superposition of 20 selected and refined solution structures of the a1 homeodomain fragment (residues 8-57). Unstructured residues Lys -3 to Ser 7 are omitted for clarity. Labels indicate each helix and the N- and C-termini of the protein.

helix 3. Figure 2 shows the superposition of the 20 lowestenergy conformations of a1. The solution structure calculations result in a family of 20 structures with an average backbone rmsd of 0.264 Å. The quality of the set of 20 final structures was assessed with the AQUA and PROCHECK NMR programs (33). The Ramachandran plot showed that 99.9% of structured residues 8-53 had  and  values in the allowed regions. The structure selected by NMRCLUST to be representative of the 20 lowest-energy conformations was analyzed using the secondary structure definition method of Kabsch and Sander (36). Thus, H1 is defined as extending from Pro 10 to Arg 22, H2 from Ser 28 to Cys 38, and H3 from Gln 44 to Lys 52. Using this Kabsch and Sander analysis, both the loop and the turn of the homeodomain consist of six residues. No consensus structure was determined for the N-terminal residues of the homeodomain, from Lys -3 to Ser 9. The most probable loop conformers are captured in the solution structure refinement. An analysis of root-meansquare standard deviations of side chain heavy atoms (not shown) and circular variance in the 20 representative solution structures of the a1 homeodomain highlights the variation in positions of side chains in the H1 and loop 1 regions compared to the helix-turn-helix segment of the homeodomain. Indeed, residues in this region have a below average completeness of NOEs as judged by the AQUA program (37). Specifically, the circular variance (CV), or the spread of dihedral angles, for the Phe 20 side chain (CV 2 ) 0.371) is significantly higher than for Phe 24 (CV 2 ) 0.001) and Phe 53 (CV 2 ) 0.007) that are better packed in the protein core. To verify the solution structure of a1, 10% of the NOEs used in the final structure determination were removed at random. Fifty random starting conformations were generated and the X-PLOR calculations performed as described in Materials and Methods. The helix angles of the 10 new lowest-energy structures were unchanged from their previous values, although the uncertainty increased. This procedure was repeated after removing a total of 20% of the NOEs, with the same result.

FIGURE 3: (A) CR backbone displacements comparing a1 free in solution and bound in a ternary complex (a1-R2-hsg operator) plotted vs residue number. The two structures were matched from residues 10-52 using the MidasPlus program (54, 55) giving a rmsd of 1.83 Å over the backbone N, CR, and C atoms. (B) Plot of the magnitude of differences in  backbone torsion angle between a1 free in solution and bound in the ternary complex plotted vs residue number.

Comparison of the Solution Structure of a1 with the Bound Form in the a1-R2-DNA Complex. With the solution structure of the a1 homeodomain in hand, we compared the free structure to the bound form of the protein as found in the crystal structure of the a1-R2-hsg operator complex (4). Although the side chain atoms of Gln 18, Arg 21, Glu 32, and Ser 56 were not resolved in the crystal structure, backbone comparisons should be valid. Figure 3A shows the distance between corresponding R-carbons for the representative NMR structure and the X-ray structure of a1 in the ternary complex (4) resulting in a rmsd of 1.83 Å over the backbone atoms. The largest deviation appears at the C-terminus, where the third helix is unraveled from residues 53 to 55 compared with the helix in the ternary complex. Other differences in backbone displacement are significantly smaller but tend to occur in the loop and turn regions of the homeodomain. Examination of the backbone dihedral angles can also indicate differences between two conformations of the same protein, with the advantage that analysis of dihedral angles is independent of how the structures are matched. Figure 3B shows the magnitude of the differences in the backbone torsion angle  for the solution and X-ray structures. Local differences in backbone conformation are clustered in the loop between H1 and H2, although Thr 41 and Arg 53 also undergo significant  angle changes (Figure 3B). Similar results were observed for the backbone dihedral angle  (not pictured). To further analyze the effects of backbone dihedral changes, the relative orientation of the helices was calculated. An axis for each helix was determined using the program Helix (38), and then angles between the helical axes were

computed. Table 2 shows the average of these angles for the 20 lowest-energy solution structures of a1 and, as a comparison, for a1 in the ternary complex. The angle between H2 and H3 is somewhat different for the free and bound forms of a1, but the angles between H1 and H2, and H1 and H3, differ by an amount significantly larger than the uncertainty in the solution values. It is likely that H1 has a different orientation with respect to the rest of the homeodomain (HTH) in the solution structure of a1. This is shown directly in Figure 4, where the representative solution structure and the X-ray structure are superimposed. 15N Relaxation Rate Measurements. NMR spectra of the a1 homeodomain provide qualitative evidence of a range of backbone dynamics. 1H-15N HSQC spectra contain eight sharp, intense resonances assigned to residues in the Nterminal segment of the sequence. In addition, the resonances for Leu 16, Lys 23, Leu 26, and Thr 41 are doubled with an

approximate ratio of major to minor peaks of 8:1. Several other peaks are broadened and weak in intensity relative to other HSQC resonances, including Arg 21, Arg 22, Ser 25, Asn 27, and Cys 38. To further quantify a1 homeodomain backbone dynamics, we measured 15N relaxation rates for 51 out of 61 residues in the a1 homeodomain. Missing data for assigned residues are due to resonance overlap, especially for residues in the N-terminal segment of the sequence. The experimental values for relaxation rates, R1 and R2, plotted against residue number are shown in Figure 5. The average value of T1 ()1/R1) was 461 ( 74 ms; the average T2 ()1/R2) was 140 ( 70 ms. The large standard deviations reflect the range of relaxation rates manifested by backbone 15 N nuclei in the a1 homeodomain. Residues in the Nterminal segment of the homeodomain, characterized by reduced relaxation rates, are unstructured by other criteria, such as the lack of medium- and long-range NOEs, negative 15N NOEs (data not shown), and intermediate values of 3J HNHR. Similar dynamic behavior is noted for the C-terminal residues, Ser 56 and Lys 57. When relaxation times for residues with negative and very low 15N{1H} NOE values are excluded from calculation of the mean, the average value of T1 was 433 ( 32 ms; the average T2 was 120 ( 43 ms. The structured region of the a1 homeodomain, encompassing residues 8-56, contains two regions characterized by increased R2 rates and decreased R1 rates, relative to the mean. Both segments encompass turns in the a1 homeodomain structure, loop 1 residues Lys 23-Asn 27 and turn 2 residues Cys 38-Pro 42. The relaxation data suggest that the rmsd of the backbone structure reported here may suggest more structure and rigidity than the raw NMR data indicate. Model-Free Analysis. The experimentally determined relaxation rates and heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOE data for structured residues Gln 11-Arg 55 were fit to spectral density functions to calculate order parameters (S2). All the experimental data were adequately fit to spectral density functions containing one or two adjustable parameters. Once spectral density models were selected, the overall correlation time (m) was simultaneously optimized for all residues. The optimized correlation time for the a1 homeodomain was 5.09 ( 0.04 ns.

Anderson et al. turn, for instance). We also find that residues at the end of the third helix require exchange terms, indicative of helix fraying. Three other residues requiring Rex terms (Ala 14, Glu 17, and Arg 46) are contained in the middle of helices 1 and 3, at the point that the two helices cross, suggesting some flexibility in the interface between these helices. Four residues (Arg 21, Ser 25, Cys 38, and Ile 40) require Rex terms greater than 9 s-1. Arg 21 is the likely C-terminal capping residue for H1, although the structure of the C-terminal helix cap does not fit any of the canonical capping motifs described by Aurora and Rose (39). Ser 25, Cys 38, and Ile 40 are all loop and turn residues. All residues requiring Rex terms manifest broadened or doubled resonances in the NMR spectra. DISCUSSION The a1 homeodomain has been set apart from other homeodomains characterized in the literature because it does not bind DNA on its own in vitro. Nonetheless, previous work has shown that the a1 homeodomain contributes a surprising amount of binding energy to the functional repressor complex it forms with the R2 protein (21-23). The current model of cooperative binding, presented by Stark and co-workers (22), is that R2 effects a change in a1 that converts a1 from a weak to strong DNA-binding protein. Here we report the solution structure of the a1 homeodomain, supplemented with backbone dynamics information. Not surprisingly, on the basis of earlier NMR characterization (24), the a1 structure (Figure 2) consists of three helices connected by two turns, similar to all other homeodomain structures determined to date. The N-Terminal Arm of a1 BehaVes Differently from That of Other Homeodomains. The N-terminal residues (from Lys -3 to Gly 4) of the a1 homeodomain are largely unstructured (S2 < 0.2) and do not contact the folded, helical domain in any significant or specific manner in solution. Unlike the Oct-1 (40) and Isl-1 (41) homeodomains, a1 exhibits no unambiguous NOE connectivity between the N-terminal arm and the folded helical core. Chemical shift mapping of a1 titrated with R2 (24) indicates that heterodimerization does not affect or involve the N-terminal arm residues in solution. In other homeodomain-DNA complexes that have been characterized (6), the N-terminal arm makes multiple base pair contacts in the minor groove of substrate DNA. However, a1 residues in both the N-terminal arm and at the beginning of H1 (from Lys 0 to Ala 12) were undetected and disordered in the a1-R2-DNA ternary structures determined by crystallographic methods (4, 42). Further, it has been recently reported that deletion studies suggest that this arm does not play a significant role in a1-R2 binding to DNA (43). The previous experimental data, along with the solution structure data, show that the N-terminal arm is unstructured both free and bound to DNA, and this could account for the relative inability of a1 to bind DNA on its own compared to other homeodomains. Favorable enthalpic contacts between N-terminal arm residues and the DNA substrate that might help drive the DNA binding event in other systems are not available for a1. Since the a1-DNA interaction appears to be so important in vivo, the a1 homeodomain must have evolved other mechanisms of DNA binding to compensate for its disadvantageous N-terminal arm.

FIGURE 5: Experimental values for 15N relaxation rates, R1 and R2 (in s-1), and the order parameters (S2) determined for the a1 homeodomain plotted vs residue number. Measured 15N R1 rates are shown in panel A and 15N R2 rates in panel B. Order parameters (S2) are plotted in panel C. Gaps in the data result from overlapping or broadened resonances that made measurements unreliable. Error bars are shown.

As qualitatively predicted from the relaxation data and line shape analysis, the N-terminal arm residues (from Lys -3 to Ser 9) have very low (S2 < 0.5) order parameters, as do the two C-terminal residues (Figure 5C). The structured homeodomain residues, in both helices and turns, have order parameters averaging 0.83 ( 0.07, a typical value for backbone residues of folded, globular proteins. Only two backbone amides have significantly lower order parameters: Leu 26 in loop 1 (0.67) and Thr 41 in turn 2 (0.59). The relaxation data for 21 residues of the a1 homeodomain were adequately fit by the simple spectral density function. Residues in the N-terminal arm and at the end of H3 required an additional term (effective correlation time, e) to account for fast motions. In addition, some residues in the structured part of the protein required an additional e term, including Leu 26, Lys 29, Glu 30, Val 34, Val 45, and Lys 52. Leu 26 is contained in loop 1. Lys 29, Glu 30, and Val 34 are contained in the first turn of H2; Val 45 is at the beginning of H3. Lys 52 is the last residue in H3. Fifteen residues required an additional Rex term that suggests local backbone motions on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Their locations in the a1 homeodomain structure are generally at the interfaces between secondary structure elements (the transition from helix to

Structure and Dynamics of the a1 Homeodomain The C-Terminus of the DNA Recognition Helix Is Poorly Structured in the MATa1 Structure. The solution structure and backbone dynamics data indicate that the C-terminal end (residues Arg 53-Lys 57) of the DNA-binding helix (H3) is frayed and largely unstructured. Very low order parameters (S2 < 0.3, Figure 5C), intermediate 3JHNHR coupling constants, and a lack of medium- to long-range NOE connectivities are observed for Ser 56 and Lys 57. Slower backbone motions, in the microsecond to millisecond time range, for residues Lys 52-Lys 57 are inferred from resonance peak line shapes and spectral density model fits that require extra Rex terms. These solution characteristics suggest a poorly folded and perhaps underwound C-terminal turn of the DNAbinding helix. Similar solution behavior at the C-terminal end of the DNA-binding helix has been noted for several homeodomains, including Antennapedia (Antp) (44), Oct-1 POU (40), and vnd/NK-2 (45) homeodomains. Chemical shift mapping studies (24) and NOE data for a1 bound to R2, in the absence of DNA (unpublished data from S. M. Baxter and J. S. Anderson), suggest that complete folding of the C-terminal end of the recognition helix must occur upon DNA binding, not as a result of the R2-a1 association alone. DNA is required to induce the final bound conformation. Upon comparison of the length of the helix in the free a1 structure and the ternary structure of the ternary complex (4), DNA binding extends the third helix of a1 by three residues. The extension of H3 presumably brings Met 54 and Arg 55 into proper alignment to make contacts in the DNA major groove observed in the a1-R2-DNA structure (4). It is useful to compare this ordering process with other homeodomains whose structures have been determined in free and DNA-bound states. Antp has eight residues at the end of H3 which become R-helical upon DNA binding; there are 10 in vnd/NK-2 and 5 in en. This suggests that there is less enthalpy released due to hydrogen bond formation in a1 compared to other homeodomain systems, as well as less of an entropic penalty due to H3 ordering (46, 47) upon DNA binding. However, the rearrangement of this third helix upon DNA contact alone is apparently not sufficient to drive high-affinity binding. In lieu of additional binding energy, perhaps gained by N-terminal arm interactions in other systems, a1 still requires the changes induced by R2 to overcome the energy barriers the native a1 protein faces in binding DNA. Turn 2 Is Not Greatly Affected by R2 Binding. Turn 2 of the homeodomain (T2) is contained in the characteristic DNA binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure, and typically, the length and structure of this turn are conserved among homeodomains and HTH binding proteins (48). The 15N backbone relaxation data indicate that the DNA-binding HTH portion of the a1 homeodomain may not be a rigid DNAbinding unit; rather, it may also have some hinge-like flexibility. Chemical shift mapping studies (24) of the free and R2-bound forms of a1 do not result in significant chemical shift changes for turn 2 residues upon heterodimerization in the absence of DNA. Any backbone conformational changes observed in this region upon ternary complex formation must occur upon DNA binding. As a result, it is not likely that changes in turn 2 are related to the instructions that R2 gives to induce high-affinity a1-DNA binding. Changes in the Loop 1 Structure Influence Tertiary Structure and DNA Binding Interface. The first turn, a loop

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 33, 2000 10051 connecting H1 and H2, forms part of the hydrophobic patch recognized by the C-terminal tail extension of R2 (4, 24). Amide proton line widths and 15N relaxation data (Figure 5B) suggest that loop 1 residues undergo exchange processes on the microsecond to millisecond time scale; therefore, it is likely that multiple conformations of loop 1 exist in solution. Flexibility in the first loop has also been noted in solution studies of the Oct-1 POU domain (40), another homeodomain that requires a protein cofactor, VP16, to function (49, 50). An important structural role for loop 1 may be the relative orientation of H1 with respect to H2 and H3. The a1 structure in solution differs in tertiary arrangement of its helices relative to other homeodomain structures (Table 2). By randomly removing NOEs from the structure calculations, we determine the same alignment of helices, so it is unlikely that a few maverick NOEs in the original data set are forcing H1 to form uncharacteristic angles with respect to H2 and H3 in the ensemble of solution structures. In addition, backbone relaxation behavior of residues at the interface between H1 and H3 is characteristic of motions on the microsecond to millisecond time scale, further supporting movement of the helices relative to each other. As a result, we propose that the flexibility of the loop 1 backbone allows a wider range of hinge motions in the a1 homeodomain compared to other structures, resulting in an average a1 solution structure with unique interhelical angles. The a1 homeodomain sequence is markedly different from other homeodomains in the loop 1 region (Figure 1). A conserved tyrosine, Tyr 25, found in Antp, en, and R2 homeodomains makes DNA sugar contact (51). This residue is replaced with a serine in the a1 homeodomain. Ser 25 does not make the analogous polar contact with DNA in the a1-R2-DNA complex (4). Next, the Antp and en homeodomains have an arginine at position 24; a glutamine is found at this position in a1. The side chains of Phe 20, Arg 24, and Tyr 25 form a hydrophobic stack at the C-terminal end of H1 in the Antp and en structures. The shorter side chains found in the a1 sequence cannot form this stack, perhaps destabilizing the C-terminal end of H1. We propose that it is this segment of loop 1 sequence that results in the loss of a conserved polar DNA contact, poor side chain stacking, and increased H1-H2 hinge flexibility in the native a1 homeodomain. This poorly folded and flexible loop region and the ineffective N-terminal arm combine to make the a1 homeodomain a poor DNA-binding protein on its own. Changes in Loop 1 Hydrogen Bonding and Side Chain Packing Are Associated with Ternary Complex Formation. Previous structural studies (4, 40, 51) have highlighted the relationship between loop 1 residues and the DNA-binding helix in homeodomains. In particular, the invariant Arg 53 residue makes a network of hydrogen bonds involving bound water molecules, the DNA backbone, and backbone atoms of Leu 26 and Gln 24 in both ternary complex structures (4, 42). In the solution structure of free a1, we also observe the Arg 53 side chain in proximity to the backbone atoms of Leu 26, dictated by the NOEs observed between the two residues. The Leu 26 backbone amide exchanges rapidly with solvent (24), suggesting that the amide is exposed at the surface and not part of a rigid backbone structure in the free form of the protein. In addition, the ternary complex highlights a hydrogen bond between the NH1 group of Arg

FIGURE 6: Comparison of the loop 1 region of the a1 homeodomain, (A) free and (B) bound in the ternary complex (a1-R2-hsg operator). Limited NOE data defining the side chain atoms of the residues in loop 1 and the 15N backbone dynamics data suggest that the region is not rigidly structured, allowing side chain packing changes. This flexibility allows for van der Waals contacts, based on NOE-derived distance constraints, between Phe 20 and Arg 53 in the a1 solution structure. The differences seen in this region, comparing the free and bound a1 structures, suggest a mechanism linking the a1-R2 protein-protein interaction to changes in the DNA-binding helix of a1. The figures were generated from the representative solution structure of a1 (A) free in solution and the X-ray coordinates (B) from the a1R2-hsg operator complex (1YRN). The Phe 20, Gln 24, Arg, and Lys side chains are depicted in both structures. The figure was created with the program MolScript (56).

53 and the carbonyl oxygen of Gln 24. In the free a1 structure, we find the backbone carbonyl of Gln 24 and HE of Arg 53 within hydrogen bonding distance, instead of the NH1 protons. This network of hydrogen bonding and side chain contacts serves to anchor H3 to the loop between H1 and H2 in both the free and bound forms, although subtle changes in hydrogen bonding may occur upon ternary complex formation. Some of the largest differences in backbone torsion angles between the free and ternary complex-bound structures of a1 are observed in loop 1 at Gln 24, Ser 25, and Leu 26. Ser 25 is a notably broadened, doubled peak with an unusual 15N frequency of 113.76 ppm in all free a1 spectra that sharpens upon heterodimerization in R2-bound a1 NMR spectra (24). Marked changes were also observed in the amide proton backbone chemical shift, NOE pattern, and coupling constant at Leu 26 upon R2 binding alone. Backbone changes in the segment of residues 24-26 could be effected by the contact observed in the ternary complex (4) between the side chain of Asn 27 and the backbone amide of Thr 60 in R2. These changes could be the basis of the instructions that the R2 tail gives to a1 to convert it from a weak to a strong DNA-binding protein. The specific change in the loop 1 structure involves the van der Waals stacking of side chains at the C-terminal end of H1. The highly conserved Phe 20 residue is not fully buried in the interior of the homeodomain in either the free a1 or the free Oct-1 structures. Aliphatic contacts between Phe 20 and residues in the DNA recognition helix of Oct-1 have been noted previously (40). In agreement, we see van der Waals contacts, based on NOE-derived distance constraints, between Phe 20 and Arg 53 in the a1 structure (Figure 6A). The aliphatic portion of Arg 53 provides hydrophobic burial for one side of the Phe 20 side chain in the representative a1 structure. It is at this point, at Arg 53,

that the DNA-binding helix (H3) begins fraying in solution. The long side chain of Arg 24 that buries the Phe 20 side chain in the engrailed structure is replaced with glutamine in both a1 and Oct-1. Gln 24 does not make efficient van der Waals contact with the aromatic ring of Phe 20 in the representative a1 solution structure (Figure 6A). Binding of the R2 C-terminal tail results in more efficient side chain packing of the aliphatic portion of the Gln 24 side chain against the aromatic ring of Phe 20 in a1 (Figure 6B). In the bound complex (4), the aliphatic side chain of Lys 52, instead of Arg 53, stacks against the Phe 20 side chain, as a result of a tighter turn of the R-helix when a1 is bound to DNA. Thus, a change at Phe 20 could be transmitted to residues in the DNA recognition helix, effectively providing additional ordering energy for the folding of the C-terminal helix observed upon DNA binding. The R2 Interaction Stabilizes the DNA Binding Conformation of the a1 Homeodomain. Since the a1 homeodomain does not appear to use adjacent, flanking sequences for protein-protein interactions, it must take another approach to gain combinatorial advantage. Flexibility coupled with protein-protein interactions could combine to modulate DNA binding affinity of homeodomains such as a1 and the Oct-1 POU domain. It is true that flexibility in protein structure could lead to an entropic penalty upon DNA binding that might result in lowered binding affinities. But, flexibility can serve as a control mechanism in vivo since these homeodomains are only able to effectively bind DNA under the proper circumstances, when their protein cofactors are present. Others have noted (21, 22) that most of the specific energy for binding DNA observed upon a1-R2 heterodimerization comes from the effect of R2 on the a1 structure rather than the effective tethering or recruiting of one homeodomain for another. In particular, Stark and co-workers (22) have

Structure and Dynamics of the a1 Homeodomain recently demonstrated that a peptide with a sequence identical to the C-terminal tail of R2 is sufficient to induce changes in a1, making it competent to bind DNA tightly and specifically in vitro. These studies suggest that the R2 peptide-a1 homeodomain interaction provides the energetic switch that turns a1 into a functional repressor. We propose that there are at least three ways in which the a1 protein becomes more ordered upon heterodimerization and DNA binding. Two involve secondary structure. First is the extension of the DNA recognition helix (H3) by three residues, and second is the rearrangement of residues in loop 1 which influences side chain packing at the end of helix 1. On the basis of backbone displacements, dihedral angle changes, and chemical shift changes, at least four residues in loop 1 (Lys 23-Asn 27) must rearrange upon heterodimerization. The third component of folding involves changes in tertiary structure: the restriction of hinge motions at loop 1 and the reorientation of H1 with respect to H2 and H3. These folding operations are related to each other; in particular, the reorientation of H1 may not be possible without the rearrangement of residues in loop 1. These ordering changes are triggered by the binding of the R2 tail to the loop 1 region of the a1 homeodomain. We propose that this R2-a1 interface serves to reduce the flexibility of loop 1 in a1. Concomitantly, the changes in the stacking interactions in the loop 1 region cooperatively stabilize the functional DNA-bound structure of the a1 recognition helix. The effect of this R2 tail-induced ordering must be a reduction in the entropic barrier the native a1 homeodomain faces in folding into its high-affinity DNAbinding form. As a result, the free energy of heterodimerDNA association is more favorable than that of the a1 monomer-DNA association. These results reinforce the idea of a stepwise series of associations that confer specificity and tight binding on heterodimeric ternary complexes (52, 53). While our studies highlight structural changes that occur in the a1 homeodomain structure upon ternary complex formation, we need information from calorimetric studies to characterize the thermodynamic fingerprint and relative energetic importance of the protein-protein and heterodimer-DNA association events. In addition, we plan to study a1 homeodomain sequence variants to test the cooperative linkage between side chain interactions in loop 1 and high-affinity DNA binding. Nonetheless, subtle, intricate changes in structure and dynamics hold the key to specificity and affinity in this system and provide a model for other homeodomain proteins that require cofactors to function properly.
