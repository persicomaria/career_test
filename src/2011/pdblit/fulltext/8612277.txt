VP39 is a bifunctional mRNA-modifying protein that acts as both an mRNA cap-speci®c 2H -O-methyltransferase and a processivity factor for VP55, the vaccinia poly(A) polymerase catalytic subunit. Although regions of the protein surface required for methyltransferase function are well de®ned, it has been unclear whether the protein polyadenylylation function requires direct RNA contact and, if so, where the contact site(s) might be located on the protein surface. Here, we show that the VP55VP39 heterodimer forms a stable complex with a 50mer oligonucleotide bearing a U2-N25-U motif, as opposed to the U2-N15-U motif that is optimal for stable complex formation with VP55 alone. An oligonucleotide bearing a U2-N25-U motif in which the downstream U residue is replaced with 4thioU can be ef®ciently photocrosslinked to VP39, but only in the context of the VP55-VP39 heterodimer. By partial proteolysis of endlabeled VP39, the site of oligonucleotide photocrosslinking was localized to the region of VP39 between residues Lys90 and Arg122. Peptide microsequencing and con®rmatory mutagenesis identi®ed the side-chain of Arg107 as the photocrosslinking site. Substitution of this residue with lysine abolished photocrosslinking entirely, consistent with the established RNA binding role of arginine in other RNA-binding proteins. This study provides clear evidence for a polyadenylylation-speci®c RNA-contact site on the surface of VP39, which is distinct from the RNA-binding methyltransferase ``cleft'' characterized in recent crystallographic and biochemical studies.

Introduction
Poly(A) tails are added to vaccinia virus mRNA through the action of a virus-encoded heterodimeric poly(A) polymerase (PAP; Gershon, 1998; Gershon et al., 1991; Moss et al., 1975; Nevins & Joklik, 1977). The larger (VP55) subunit possesses all of the catalytic functions required for poly(A) tail formation, but can processively

add tails no more than 30-35 nt in length before abruptly dissociating from the RNA (Gershon & Moss, 1992). The smaller (VP39) subunit acts as a processivity factor for VP55, enabling the latter to synthesize physiological-length tails in a processive (or semi-processive) manner (Gershon & Moss, 1993a). Although little is known about the VP55 protein itself, its interaction with priming oligonucleotides has been extensively examined and a set of ``rules'' has been elucidated (Deng & Gershon, 1997; Deng et al., 1997; Gershon & Moss, 1993b). Thus, for the formation of stable VP55-oligonucleotide electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) complexes, oligonucleotides should be >30-34 nt in length and contain multiple internal ribouridylate bases (Gershon & Moss, 1993b). Ironically, of the homo# 1999 Academic Press

1418 polymers based upon the four standard RNA basetypes (A, C, G, U), oligo(C) appears to be the least supportive of stable VP55 binding (Gershon & Moss, 1993b) despite its close structural relationship with oligo(U), an optimal primer. After incubation of VP55 with 32P-labeled 3H -dATP (a chainterminating adenylate) and an oligonucleotide pool comprising (dC)34 randomly spiked at a low level with rU, those oligonucleotide substrates containing uridylate bases at two internal positions, $25 and $10 nt from the 3H -OH, became selectively labeled indicating two sites of internal uridylate recognition within the primer (Deng & Gershon, 1997). Targeted mutagenesis showed a requirement for only three ribouridylate bases at the two sites, whose optimal positions were shown to be 27, 26 and 10 nt from the oligonucleotide 3H -OH. Although other positions may contain any RNA or DNA nucleotide, a ribose sugar at the extreme 3H end nucleotide and at the third nucleotide from the 3H end, in combination with the three internal ribouridylate bases, recapitulates the stable VP55 binding properties of an oligo(rU) segment of equivalent length. In addition to being a PAP processivity factor, VP39 has a second, entirely unrelated function as an mRNA cap-speci®c 2H -O-methyltransferase (Schnierle et al., 1992). Thus, VP39 is a bifunctional RNA-modifying protein, acting at the 5H as well as the 3H end of nascent mRNA. Currently, it is unclear what in vivo function(s) might be served by the VP39 bifunctionality. Exquisite crystallographic structures showing VP39  cofactor (Hodel et al., 1996), VP39  coproduct  m7G (Hodel et al., 1997) and VP39  coproduct  capped RNA (Hodel et al., 1998) show that the VP39 surface is in the form of an oblate sphere with a cleft running across one surface. Surface regions participating in mRNA 5H end modi®cation are clearly identi®able from the co-crystalsubstrate and lized 2H -O-methyltransferase cofactor. Thus, the binding site for the m7G moiety of the mRNA cap comprises an aromaticlined pocket punctuating one end of the cleft (Hodel et al., 1997), and the binding site for S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) comprises a second, shallower pocket, positioned perpendicular to the cleft's central region (Hodel et al., 1996). The cleft was shown, crystallographically, to interact with mRNA 5H end segments via the three nucleotides immediately adjacent to the m7Gppp cap structure, in such a way that the methyl accepting ribose 2H -OH is positioned proximal to the donor methyl of AdoMet. RNA binding within the cleft occurred entirely via the phosphodiester backbone (Hodel et al., 1998). Mutations in VP39 surface regions whose participation in methyltransferase function have been established crystallographically, i.e. the cleft, m7Gbinding pocket and AdoMet binding site, affect methyltransferase but not polyadenylylation function (Schnierle et al., 1994; Shi et al., 1996). Together with indications that molecular interactions rel-

evant to VP39 methyltransferase function do not detectably impinge upon polyadenylylation in vitro (and vice versa; Gershon et al., 1998), this would suggest the use of distinct surface regions for VP39's two functions. The VP39 polyadenylylation processivity function would be expected to require, at the very least, a dimerization interface for VP55. An RNA binding site for interaction with the poly(A) tail would also seem likely. Due to extreme dif®culties isolating polyadenylylationspeci®c VP39 muteins, VP39's dimerization interface for VP55 was identi®ed using direct biochemical approaches (Shi et al., 1997). These studies not only localized the interface to a surface region located distal to the methyltransferase cleft (Shi et al., 1997), but they also provided evidence for conformational changes within VP39 upon its interaction with VP55. With regard to a possible polyadenylylation-speci®c RNA binding site, EMSA-based studies with monomeric VP39 (Gershon et al., 1998) have suggested the presence of two independent RNA binding sites, only one of which shows speci®city for m7G-capped RNA (presumably the cleft, above). However, a polyadenylylation-speci®c RNA binding site has not been positively identi®ed. Despite progress in understanding how RNA interacts with the VP55 and VP39 subunits individually (above), very little is known about RNA transactions with the VP55-VP39 heterodimer. In one experiment, while demonstrating the interaction of monomeric VP55 with uridylates $25 and $10 nt from oligonucleotide 3H ends (above), it was found that for oligonucleotides of suf®cient overall length, the upstream contact shifts $10 nt further upstream in the presence of VP39 (Deng & Gershon, 1997). It was not established why the upstream contact site was positioned differently for monomeric VP55 and the VP55-VP39 heterodimer, or which heterodimer subunit contacts the upstream site. Here, we establish that the VP39 polyadenylylation processivity function does indeed involve direct VP39-RNA contact within the heterodimer, and identify a VP39 surface sidechain that contacts the primer only in the context of a polyadenylylation-speci®c ternary complex.

Results
U2-N25-U: A motif for stable interaction with the vaccinia PAP heterodimer Substrate selection experiments had shown monomeric VP55 to interact with two ribouridylate patches within its primer, located $10 nt and $25 nt from the 3H -OH and that, for the VP55-VP39 heterodimer, the $ À25 patch is replaced with one located 10 nt further upstream (Deng & Gershon, 1997). Since, for monomeric VP55, the two patches can be replaced with three ribouridylates positioned 10, 26 and 27 nt from the primer 3H -OH (Deng et al., 1997), we reasoned that the heterodimer might also require no more

1419 nucleotide UU(dC)25U, but this time combining unlabeled oligonucleotide with 32P-end-labeled VP55 or VP39 (data not shown). Complex 2 was observed in the presence of the two subunits and oligonucleotide irrespective of which component was labeled. We conclude that complex 2 represents the stable heterodimer-oligonucleotide complex, that no more than three ribouridylate bases are required within the oligonucleotide primer for heterodimer-oligonucleotide interaction, and that the preferred position within the oligonucleotide for the UU dinucleotide is 10 nt further upstream for the VP55-VP39 heterodimer than for monomeric VP55. VP39 can be efficiently photocrosslinked to a U2-N25-U-containing oligonucleotide with a single 4thioU-substitution, but only in the context of the VP55-VP39 heterodimer We next wondered which subunit of the VP55VP39 heterodimer was contacting each of the three uridylate bases within complex 2. We therefore synthesized three new oligonucleotides based upon oligonucleotide UU(dC)25U (Figure 1; see Materials and Methods), in which each of the uridine bases was individually substituted with the photosensitive uridine analog 4-thioU (4SrU). The three new oligonucleotides (SU(dC)25U, US(dC)25U and UU(dC)25S, where S represents the position of the analog) were each labeled, incubated with VP55 and VP39 (individually and together), irradiated brie¯y at 350 nm, and the products subjected to SDS-PAGE (Figure 2). Oligonucleotides SU(dC)25U and US(dC)25U did not photocrosslink well to either subunit (<0.01% of the total input oligonucleotide forming photoproducts resolvable in the SDS gel), and oligonucleotide UU(dC)25S also did not photocrosslink to either subunit individually. However, in the presence of both subunits, UU(dC)25S photocrosslinked very strongly with VP39 (Figure 2, extreme right-hand lane). Although the irradiated mixtures were applied directly to SDS gels in the experiment shown, identical results were also obtained when the irradiated mixtures were ®rst applied to an EMSA gel, the heterodimer complexes excised, and their contents resolved by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Negligible photocrosslinking was observed in control experiments employing the parental oligonucleotide non-4SrU-containing (UU(dC)25U, above). Identification of the region of VP39 between residues K90 and R122 as the site of oligonucleotide photocrosslinking To identify the region of VP39 that had become crosslinked, we employed a previously developed protease mapping technique (Shi et al., 1997) in which 32P-end-labeled VP39 had been partially digested with trypsin, the resulting products resolved electrophoretically, and 31 of the 32

than three ribouridylate bases, whose optimal positions might be 10, 36 and 37 nt from the primer 3H -OH. To test this, we synthesized two 50mer oligonucleotides, whose ribouridylates were placed at either À10, À26 and À27, or À10, À36 and À37 (designated UU-(dC)15-U and UU(dC)25-U, respectively). As in other studies (Deng & Gershon, 1997; Deng et al., 1997), all nonuridylate positions were ®lled with oligo(dC), except for the extreme 3H terminal residue, which was riboC. The two oligonucleotides were 5H endlabeled and tested as EMSA probes with VP55, VP39 and the VP55-VP39 heterodimer (Figure 1). No complexes were detected with VP39 alone, consistent with the previously observed very low stability of VP39-oligonucleotide EMSA complexes, except under conditions of very high protein concentration (Gershon et al., 1998). As predicted, VP55 formed an abundant EMSA complex with oligo UU(dC)15U but no detectable complex with oligo UU(dC)25U. In the presence of both subunits, an additional band of slower mobility (labeled 2 in Figure 1) was observed, which was 6.5-fold more abundant with oligo UU(dC)25U than with UU(dC)15U and, therefore, appeared to represent an oligonucleotide-heterodimer complex. Since oligonucleotide-heterodimer complexes had not been observed in the EMSA, we con®rmed that complex 2 did indeed contain both subunits by recapitulating the EMSA experiment with oligo-

In the two oligonucleotides used (denoted UU(dC)15U and UU(dC)25U; see Materials and Methods for sequences), the UU dinucleotide was located at either À26/À27 or À36/À37, respectively. F, 1 and 2 denote positions of free oligonucleotide, the oligonucleotide-VP55 complex and the oligonucleotide-heterodimer complex, respectively.

Figure 2. VP39 can be ef®ciently photocrosslinked to an oligonucleotide possessing a 4SrU-substituted heterodimerbinding motif, but only in the context of the VP55-VP39 heterodimer. The SDS-PAGE gel shows UV-photocrosslinking products from irradiated, equimolar mixtures of VP55 and/or VP39 with three 4SrU-containing 50mer oligonucleotides: SU(dC)25U, US(dC)25U and UU(dC)25S (see Materials & Methods and Results for the oligonucleotide sequences). F, 55-( and 39-( refer to the electrophoretic positions of free 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, photocrosslinked oligonucleotide-VP55 conjugate and photocrosslinked oligonucleotide-VP39 conjugate, respectively. For the VP39-oligonucleotide conjugate, photocrosslinking experiments routinely yielded two closely spaced bands, the slowermigrating of which was the abundant product observed with oligonucleotide UU(dC)25S (above).

basic residues (trypsin-cleavage sites) present within the central $90% of the VP39 ``core'' (i.e. regions other than the C-terminal 36 residue ``tail'') assigned to speci®c cleavage products. In the current experiment, we expected the ladder of labeled peptides resulting from partial cleavage between the terminal label and the photocrosslinking site to co-electrophorese with those from ``free'' (uncrosslinked) protein, and peptides corresponding with cleavages beyond the photocrosslinking site to be uniformly retarded in electrophoretic mobility. Thus, a gap would appear in the product ladder corresponding to the approximate photocrosslinking site within VP39 (Figure 3(a)). To verify the above prediction, N and C-terminally PKA (protein kinase A) site-tagged versions of VP39 lacking most or all of the tail (referred to as VP39-NÁC26 and VP39-CÁC36, respectively; Shi et al., 1997) were 32P-end-labeled, mixed with VP55

and oligonucleotide UU(dC)25S and UV-irradiated. The photocrosslinked and free versions of both proteins were puri®ed by SDS-PAGE, subjected to partial proteolysis with various amounts of trypsin, and the resulting material was electrophoresed in a high-resolution (peptide) SDS gel (Figure 3(b)). The resulting trypsin ``ladders'' were essentially as predicted (above), enabling the approximate site of photocrosslinking to be identi®ed. As shown in Figure 3(b) (and detailed in the legend), the largest clearly identi®able N-terminal fragment which was not photocrosslinked to the oligonucleotide corresponded with cleavage at residue K90, and the largest identi®able C-terminal fragment which was not photocrosslinked corresponded with cleavage at either R114 or R122. This indicated that the site of photocrosslinking resides within the 24-32 amino acid residue region between residues K90 and either R114 or R122.

An arrowhead marks the largest labeled product whose electrophoresis will not be retarded by conjugated oligonucleotide. Lower right, theoretical electropherogram showing partial proteolysis products from N-terminally labeled VP39 (lane N) and VP39-oligonucleotide conjugate (lane N-oligo). The band marked with an arrowhead denotes the corresponding product from the upper left panel. Products of cleavage between the labeled terminus and the crosslinking site will co-electrophorese in the two lanes. Other products will not, leaving a characteristic gap in the N-oligo product ladder corresponding with the approximate site of crosslinking. (b) Actual data. VP39-NÁC26 and VP39-CÁC36 were each 32P-endlabeled, mixed with equimolar amounts of VP55 and oligonucleotide UU(dC)25S, and irradiated at 350 nm. The photocrosslinked and free proteins were puri®ed by SDS-PAGE, incubated with various amounts of trypsin and the resulting peptides resolved by high-resolution peptide gel electrophoresis. The resulting gel is shown. Top of gel, N, N-oligo, C, and C-oligo denote groups of lanes corresponding with end-labeled VP39-NÁC26, VP39-NÁC26-oligonucleotide conjugate, VP39-CÁC36 and VP39-CÁC36-oligonucleotide conjugate, respectively. Within each group of four lanes, U denotes trypsin-untreated material and the ®lled wedge represents increasing amounts of trypsin. NM and CM denote cyanogen bromide (CNBr) partial cleavage products of VP39-NÁC26 and VP39-CÁC36, respectively. Left hand side of gel, numbers denote the positions of methionine residues within VP39 at which CNBr cleavage leads to the bands shown (determined by comparison with the gels reported by Shi et al. (1997)). Right-hand side of gel: V and V-( (arrowed) indicate the electrophoretic mobilities of uncleaved end-labeled VP39 and VP39-oligonucleotide conjugate, respectively. The arrowed line numbered 140,2,3 points to the product(s) of trypsin cleavage at R140, K142 and/or R143. Other numbers denote the methionine-cleavage products described above. Arrowheads within the gel point to the largest end-labeled digestion products that did not photocrosslink to the oligonucleotide (as in (a)). For VP39-NÁC26, this product corresponded with cleavage at residue K90, since it migrated just ahead of the CNBr fragment corresponding with cleavage at residue M92. For VP39-CÁC36, the product corresponded with cleavage at either R114 or R122 due to its migration just ahead of the product of CNBr cleavage at M92, but slightly slower than the product of trypsin cleavage at R140/K142/R143. Although this product is under-represented in the C lanes, it was clearly visible in the original image. Differences from the gels of Shi et al. (1997) in relative band intensities likely result from the trypsinization of SDS-denatured protein in the current study.

Identification of R107 as the photocrosslinked residue To identify the photocrosslinked residue of VP39, preparative amounts of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide-VP39 conjugate were puri®ed by SDSPAGE, exhaustively trypsinized, and the resulting oligonucleotide-peptide conjugate puri®ed from an SDS-PAGE peptide gel. Further puri®cation of the oligonucleotide-peptide conjugate using an ``af®nity'' procedure (L.D. & P.D.G., unpublished results) yielded a total of $10 pmol of conjugate, which was subjected to N-terminal peptide micro-

sequencing. The resulting sequence, -HDPIL (in which - represents an unidenti®able residue), corresponded with residues 99 to 103 of VP39 (Figure 4(a)), and fell within the region de®ned by protease mapping (see above). Since a residue that is stably photocrosslinked to nucleic acid would be expected to be unidenti®able by microsequencing and our photocrosslink appeared stable to the fairly harsh conditions used during conjugate puri®cation (95 C temperature and high pH), our initial candidate for the photocrosslinked residue was H98, the unidenti®able residue in the above peptide sequence (Figure 4(a)).

For other details, see (b).

type VP39 (Figure 4(b)), eliminating the wild-type N104 and L106 side-chains as likely photocrosslinking sites. We then considered the next two residues, R107 and D108, by testing mutein AS6 (Schnierle et al., 1994; Shi et al., 1997), in which the two residues had both been substituted with alanine. This mutein exhibited a profound photocrosslinking defect (Figure 4(b)). To determine which of the two substitutions was responsible, two new muteins were made in which R107 and D108 were individually substituted with alanine. Whereas mutein D108A was completely undiminished in photocrosslinking activity, R107A appeared completely defective (Figure 4(b)). Apparently, mutation of R107 to alanine completely abrogates VP39's photocrosslinking activity. Although the above data strongly implicated R107 as the site of photocrosslinking, we nonetheless considered the possibility that crosslinking might be at another site, to which the R107A mutation propagates a conformational defect. In an attempt to address this, we made two alternative, more conservative substitutions at R107, namely R107K and R107S. Both muteins were completely defective in the photocrosslinking assay (Figure 4(c)), despite the change from arginine to lysine being the most conservative of any that could have been made at that position. We conclude that, within the polyadenylylation ternary complex, the side-chain of residue R107 is in close proximity to the RNA substrate. Figure 5 shows the position of the crosslinked side-chain of R107 in relation to other structural features of VP39, including bound 2'-O-methyltransferase substrate and cofactor.

Discussion
We have shown (Figure 1) that an oligonucleotide containing a U2-N25-U motif forms a stable EMSA complex with the VP55-VP39 heterodimer but not with VP55, and that an oligonucleotide containing the U2-N15-U VP55-monomer-binding motif does not support stable interaction with the heterodimer. The heterodimer-oligonucleotide EMSA complex is presumably related to VP39's polyadenylylation function due to the requirement for both PAP subunits. Thus, whereas VP39's methyltransferase function does not require VP55, VP39's polyadenylylation function does. Indeed, the oligonucleotide(s) used here were ef®cient polyadenylylation substrates in the presence of VP39 (data not shown). Furthermore, the U2-N25-U motif can be found at the 3H end of a characterized vaccinia early mRNA 3H end (Yuen & Moss, 1986; data not shown). Although the 10 nt greater spacing between the upstream U2 and downstream U for the heterodimer than for monomeric VP55 presumably relates to the overall topology of the heterodimer-oligonucleotide complex, the latter is currently uncharacterized.

We therefore tested VP39 mutein AS5 (Schnierle et al., 1994; Shi et al., 1997; an ``alanine-scanning'' mutein in which residue H98, as well as R97 and H99, were substituted with alanine) for photocrosslinking to oligonucleotide UU(dC)25S in the presence of VP55. Photocrosslinking with AS5 was as ef®cient as that with wild-type VP39 (Figure 4(b)), eliminating the side-chains of R97, H98 and H99 as candidate photocrosslinking sites in the wild-type protein. We then looked to the C-terminal side of H99. Since residues D100 - L103 were clearly identi®able by peptide microsequencing, they were not analyzed further. Instead, we analyzed N104 and L106 by substituting them individually with alanine. Neither of the two resulting muteins (N104A and L106A) appeared defective in the photocrosslinking assay with respect to wild-

(b), (c) Rotations (90  and 135  , respectively), about the Y axis with respect to the view shown in (a). Sidechains previously shown to reside within the dimerization interface (Shi et al., 1997) are colored red. Despite being colored orange, the side-chain of R107 was also shown previously to reside within the dimerization interface.

The photocrosslinking experiments were fruitless in identifying oligonucleotide regions contacting the VP55 subunit of the heterodimer, since VP55 photocrosslinking was inef®cient irrespective of which of the three uridylate bases had undergone 4S rU substitution (Figure 2). Moreover, the identity of the subunit contacting the upstream UU dinucleotide remains unclear, since the oligonucleotides possessing 4SrU substitutions in either of the two upstream U bases photocrosslinked inef®ciently to either subunit (Figure 2). The latter result could not be attributed to preferential 4SrU-rU base-base photocrosslinking, resulting from the proximity of the photosensitive 4SrU to a neighboring rU residue, since irradiation did not abrogate strand cleavage after scission of the intervening phosphodiester with strong acid (data not shown). We therefore attribute the absence of an upstream crosslink to either the absence of a crosslinkable side-chain from either PAP subunit or a disruption of authentic binding by the 4SrU substitution. It is currently unclear whether the strong VP39 photocrosslink of the 4SrU at position À10 occurred in the context of uridine recognition, or whether the latter was compromised by the 4-thio substitution. The heterodimer-dependence of the abundant VP39-oligonucleotide photocrosslink observed in Figure 2 implies a relationship to VP39's polyadenylylation function. Since VP39 has not been shown to possess a polyadenylylation-speci®c RNA binding site, the identity of the photocrosslinked residue was of considerable interest. Here, a combination of peptide microsequencing and mutagenesis identi®ed R107 as the photocrosslinked residue. Thus, each residue of the photocrosslinked peptide to the N-terminal side of R107 (with the exception of G105) either yielded clear sequence data or could be alanine-substituted

without affecting photocrosslinking. G105, which is positioned outside of the sequenced region, was considered a poor candidate for either alanine substitution or photocrosslinking due to its lack of a side-chain. Photocrosslinking solely via a residue to the C-terminal side of R107 would only have been consistent with the peptide microsequencing and mutagenesis data if trypsin digestion had been incomplete. This is considered unlikely since the SDS-denatured protein was trypsinized exhaustively, and the resulting oligonucleotide-conjugated peptide appeared discrete by high-resolution SDSPAGE and yielded only a single readable peptide sequence. Amino acid substitutions at R107 itself (including R to K, the most conservative substitution possible) completely eliminated photocrosslinking. For the above data to have been artifactual, we would need to invoke not only incomplete trypsinization during sample preparation for peptide sequencing, but also a negative effect of the very conservative R107K substitution upon the conformation of a putative true (downstream) photocrosslinking site, despite the noneffect of much more radical (alanine) substitutions at six other residues neighboring R107. This combination of circumstances is considered highly unlikely. Finally, photocrosslinking at residue R107 itself would be expected to block its recognition by trypsin. Consistent with this, the estimated molecular mass of the photocrosslinked peptide by highresolution SDS-PAGE ($2.5 kDa) was closer to the predicted product of blocked trypsin cleavage at R107 (2.1 kDa) than to the product of unblocked digestion (1.3 kDa). To our knowledge, there are no previous reports describing the identi®cation of a protein side-chain photocrosslinking to 4SrU-substituted nucleic acid (T. Koch, personal communication).

1424 Arginine has an established role in RNA recognition within a broad class of transcriptional antiterminator RNA-binding proteins (Burd & Dreyfuss, 1994; Lazinski et al., 1989), in some members of which Arg and Lys are functionally non-equivalent in mediating RNA-protein interaction (Calanan et al., 1991; Tao & Frankel, 1992). Presumably, the considerable hydrogen-bonding potential of arginine is advantageous in mediating RNA recognition. Other factors facilitating RNA binding by the VP39 R107 side-chain might include its considerable ``protrusion'' from the protein surface, as can readily be seen in surface representations of the VP39 monomer (Figure 5). Indeed, calculations based upon VP39's crystal structure indicate the R107 side-chain to be 100% solvent exposed (a greater proportion than for any other side-chain of the protein) and to have the greatest overall solvent-exposed surface area of any VP39 residue (due to the relative bulkiness of arginine). However, since VP39 apparently undergoes conformational changes upon dimerization (Shi et al., 1997), some uncertainty may surround the precise orientation of the R107 side-chain within the heterodimer-oligonucleotide ternary complex. Assuming the side-chain has an equivalent conformation within the ternary complex to that in monomeric VP39, the substituted atoms in the non-photocrosslinkable R107K mutein would be completely exposed beyond the protein surface. This further supports the interpretation that the R107K notation's inability to photocrosslink is a result of the loss of a direct contact as opposed to a conformational change (see above). Despite contacting the oligonucleotide, VP39's R107 side-chain may not mediate much of the overall af®nity of the heterodimer for cognate oligonucleotides. Thus, R107 substitution muteins are active in the in vitro polyadenylylation assay (Schnierle et al., 1994; and data not shown). In addition, EMSA experiments have shown that irradiated ternary complexes of oligonucleotide UU(dC)25S and VP55 with either wildtype VP39 or the R107 muteins (AS6, R107S and R107K) have equivalent stabilities (data not shown) even though the muteins are completely defective in oligonucleotide photocrosslinking (as con®rmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of material eluted from the EMSA gel; data not shown). What does the R107-oligonucleotide contact tell us about the overall topology of the heterodimerRNA complex? Interestingly, a photosensitive crosslinker covalently attached to VP39 via residue 107 can be photocrosslinked to VP55 in a dimerization-dependent manner (Shi et al., 1997), indicating that R107 is normally sequestered within (or located very close to) the VP55-VP39 dimerization interface. The simplest topological model consistent with R107's role in both dimerization and RNA binding would place the heterodimer's RNA primer binding site at the subunit interface (e.g. within a cleft formed from both subunits). Such a model would also be consistent with the hetero-

dimer-dependence of oligonucleotide photocrosslinking. Although RNA binding sites created by the association of two protein subunits are comparatively rare, one clear example is provided by the recently reported crystal structure of the U2BHH U2AH -RNA ternary complex (Price et al., 1998). Alternative explanations for heterodimer-speci®c photocrosslinking may relate to conformational changes induced in VP39 by its association with VP55 (Shi et al., 1997), or elevations in the local concentration of RNA proximal to R107 due to the putative interaction of distal regions of the oligonucleotide with the VP55 subunit. A more precise understanding of the topology of the heterodimerRNA complex awaits the results of additional studies.

Materials and Methods
Materials Escherichia coli-expressed VP39-ÁC26 has been described (Gershon et al., 1998). The cloning and expression in E. coli of N-terminally and C-terminally PKA site-tagged versions of the protein (VP39-NÁC26 and VP39-CÁC36, respectively) have been described (Shi et al., 1997). Mutant proteins AS5 and AS6 (Shi et al., 1996) were prepared from the corresponding mutant plasmids described (Schnierle et al., 1994). All oligonucleotides employed here were DNA-RNA chimeras, and were synthesized on a Model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using reagents manufactured by Cruachem, Inc. The sequences of the chimeras referred to as UU(dC)15U and UU(dC)25U, SU(dC)25U, US(dC)25U and UU(dC)25S were 5H -(dC)23-(rU)2-(dC)15rU-(dC)8-rC-3H , 5H -(dC)13-(rU)2-(dC)25-rU-(dC)8-rC-3H , 5H (dC)13-4SrU-rU-(dC)25-rU-(dC)8-rC-3H , 5H -(dC)13-rU-4SrU (dC)25-rU-(dC)8-rC-3H and 5H -(dC)13-(rU)2-(dC)25-4SrU(dC)8-rC-3H , respectively, where 4SrU represents 4-thiouridine monophosphate. The latter was incorporated as the corresponding phosphoramidite (Cruachem, Inc.), after which the 4SrU-containing oligonucleotides were deprotected as directed by Cruachem. Mutagenesis, expression and purification of VP39 VP39 point mutants were prepared using the chameleon double-stranded site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described (Shi et al., 1997). The mutagenesis template for all muteins except R107K was plasmid pPG177, which encoded full-length wild-type VP39 as a GST fusion protein (Schnierle et al., 1994). For mutein R107K, the template encoded the functionally identical (Shi et al., 1996) VP39 C-terminal truncation mutant VP39-ÁC26 (Schnierle et al., 1994). Proteins were expressed in E. coli strain HB101, induced with IPTG, puri®ed over glutathione-agarose, cleaved with thrombin and quantitated by densitometry of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels, as described (Shi et al., 1996). Expression and purification of VP55 A synthetic VP55 gene with optimized codons was assembled (data not shown), cloned between the NcoI and HindIII sites of plasmid pGEX-KG (Guan & Dixon,

Polyadenylylation-speci®c RNA-contact Site of VP39 1991; i.e. immediately downstream of the glutathione-Stransferase (GST)-encoding region), and the resulting protein expressed in E. coli strain AD494 (Invitrogen). Expression conditions (growth, induction time, IPTG conc.), were as described for VP39 (above), except that E. coli was grown and induced at 25 C. VP55 was extracted and puri®ed as described for VP39 (above). Approximately 1-5 mg of puri®ed VP55 was obtained per gram of wet cells.

0.1 M DTT (10 ml), water (128 ml) and oligonucleotide UU(dC)25S (250 pmol in 2 ml). The resulting mixture was transferred to a 13 mm Â 100 mm borosilicate glass tube and irradiated at 350 nm as described above, then mixed with one-quarter volume of 4x SDS gel sample loading buffer, heated at 95 C for three minutes and subjected to 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE. Free, end-labeled VP39 was electrophoresed in adjacent lanes as a control. After electrophoresis, 32P-labeled VP39 bands corresponding to oligonucleotide-crosslinked and free protein were individually excised from the gel and the labeled material was eluted into 1 ml of 1 mM EDTA by overnight rotation at room temperature. The eluted photocrosslinked VP39 was concentrated by ultra®ltration (Centricon 10, Amicon) until its concentration corresponded with that of the free VP39, as determined by Cerenkov counting. Aliquots of the eluents (20 ml) were supplemented with 0.5, 1 and 2 mg aliquots of trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim, sequencing grade; 25 mg dissolved in 25 ml 1 mM HCl) at room temperature for one minute, as described (Shi et al., 1997). Reactions were quenched with 1 mM PMSF then snap-frozen in an alcohol/solid CO2 bath (Shi et al., 1997). The resulting peptides were resolved in a peptide SDS gel È (16 cm Â 20 cm Â 0.08 cm) as described (Schagger & von Jagow, 1987; Shi et al., 1997) which was then dried and imaged by autoradiography. VP39 peptide size markers were generated by partial cleavage of 32P-NÁC26 and 32 P-CÁC36 proteins with cyanogen bromide as described (Shi et al., 1997). Purification of peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate and peptide microsequencing A 10 ml reaction mixture containing 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 9.0), 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mM oligonucleotide UU(dC)25S (5H 32P-end-labeled), 0.22 mM VP39 and 0.55 mM VP55, was irradiated at 350 nm for ten minutes as described above (in ten 13 mm Â 100 mm borosilicate glass tubes), then mixed with 3.3 ml of 4x SDS gel sample loading buffer and concentrated to a ®nal volume of 4 ml by ultra®ltration (Centricon 10, Amicon). The sample was then heated at 95 C for ®ve minutes and applied to a 10% polyacrylamide/SDS gel (14 cm Â 14 cm Â 0.3 cm, 2 ml/gel). After electrophoresis under low-light conditions, the wet gel was imaged, and the band corresponding to photocrosslinked VP39 excised. The 32Plabeled complex was eluted from the excised gel slice by overnight rotation in 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA (12 ml), after which the gel slice was re-eluted in an identical manner and the two eluates pooled. The pooled eluent was concentrated to a ®nal volume of 1 ml by ultra®ltration and adjusted to pH 8.0 with concentrated HCl. Trypsin (15 ml of a 10 mg/ml solution in 1 mM HCl, WAKO) was then added, and the resulting mixture incubated at 37 C for 24 hours. After the addition of a second, equivalent aliquot of trypsin, the mixture was incubated at 37 C for an additional 24 hours then dried under vacuum and È redissolved in tricine sample buffer (Schagger & von Jagow, 1987), heated at 95 C for ®ve minutes and applied to a peptide SDS gel (see above). The wet gel was imaged for the presence of 32P after which the gel portion containing the oligonucleotide-linked peptide was excised and subjected to two rounds of elution into 8 ml of 1 mM EDTA by overnight rotation at 22 C. The volume of eluent was reduced to 1 ml by ultra®ltration (Centricon 10, Amicon) then

P-end-labeling of oligonucleotides and proteins

Oligonucleotides were 5H end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (Deng et al., 1997), except that oligonucleotide concentration was halved to 2.5 mM, and the concentration of [g-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/ mMol) was increased to 0.6 mM. Mixtures were incubated at 37 C for 15 minutes, followed by kinase-inactivation at 70 C for ten minutes. PKA site-tagged proteins were 32P-end-labeled using recombinant cAMP-dependent PKA catalytic subunit (New England Biolabs) as described (Shi et al., 1997). Brie¯y, reactions contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM [g-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mMol, Amersham), 1.5 mM PKA site-tagged protein and 0.25 unit/ml PKA catalytic subunit in a total volume of 30 ml. Mixtures were incubated at 30 C for 60 minutes then added directly to binding reactions, typically at a dilution of 1 in 10. EMSA The EMSA was performed as described (Deng & Gershon, 1997; Deng et al., 1997). Brie¯y, binding reactions contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM oligonucleotide and 0.2 mM of each protein, in a total volume of 10 ml. Mixtures were incubated at room temperature for ten minutes and then applied to pre-electrophoresed 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide/0.5Â TBE gels, and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 2.5 hours at room temperature. Gels were dried under vacuum and imaged using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Analytical-scale oligonucleotideVP39 photocrosslinking For the experiments shown in Figures 2 and 4, photocrosslinking reactions contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.25 mM 32P-endlabeled oligonucleotide and 0.2 mM VP55 and/or VP39 in a total volume of 30 ml. Mixtures were incubated in a 13 mm Â 100 mm borosilicate glass tube at 22 C for ten minutes under low-light conditions, then irradiated at 350 nm for ten minutes at 4 C using a photochemical reaction chamber (Rayonet RMR-600). The irradiated mixtures were mixed with one-quarter volume of 4x SDS gel sample loading buffer (Ausubel et al., 1987), heated at 95 C for three minutes, then applied directly to a 13% (w/v) polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoresed. Determination of photocrosslinking position by partial proteolysis of oligonucleotide-VP39 conjugate
32 P-end-labeled VP39 ($50 pmol in 30 ml) was mixed with VP55 ($40 pmol in 20 ml) and incubated at room temperature for ten minutes, after which the mixture was supplemented with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0, 10 ml),

1426
supplemented with 20 Â SSC (0.3 M sodium citrate (pH 7.5), 3 M NaCl) and 20% (w/v) SDS to give ®nal concentrations of 6 Â SSC and 0.1% SDS, respectively. An af®nity procedure was employed as the ®nal puri®cation step (L.D. & P.D.G., unpublished results), whose alkaline eluent was neutralized with an equal volume of 50 mM Tris (pH 6.8). The resulting material was incubated with 0.1 pmol of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 C for 24 hours (to eliminate radioactivity prior to peptide sequencing), dried under vacuum (without heat) to a ®nal volume of $0.1 ml, supplemented with formic acid to 5% ®nal concentration and applied manually to the biphasic column of a Hewlett Packard G1005A Protein Sequencer (Palo Alto CA) in 1 ml of 2% TFA. Washing the column with three 1 ml aliquots of 2% TFA eluted >99.5% of the 32P (orthophosphate) present in the initial sample (as determined by Cerenkov counting). The column was then loaded onto the sequencer for sequencing using the manufacturer's recommended protocols, Chemistry Routine 3.5 and HPLC method PTH 4.
