ABSTRACT: The topa quinone (TPQ) cofactor of copper amine oxidase is generated by copper-assisted self-processing of the precursor protein. Metal ion specificity for TPQ biogenesis has been reinvestigated with the recombinant phenylethylamine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis. Besides Cu2+ ion, some divalent metal ions such as Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ were also bound to the metal site of the apoenzyme so tightly that they were not replaced by excess Cu2+ ions added subsequently. Although these noncupric metal ions could not initiate TPQ formation under the atmospheric conditions, we observed slow spectral changes in the enzyme bound with Co2+ or Ni2+ ion under the dioxygen-saturating conditions. Resonance Raman spectroscopy and titration with phenylhydrazine provided unambiguous evidence for TPQ formation by Co2+ and Ni2+ ions. Steady-state kinetic analysis showed that the enzymes activated by Co2+ and Ni2+ ions were indistinguishable from the corresponding metal-substituted enzymes prepared from the native copper enzyme (Kishishita, S., Okajima, T., Kim, M., Yamaguchi, H., Hirota, S., Suzuki, S., Kuroda, S., Tanizawa, K., and Mure, M. (2003) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 1041-1055). X-ray crystallographic analysis has also revealed structural identity of the active sites of Co- and Ni-activated enzymes with Cu-enzyme. Thus Cu2+ ion is not the sole metal ion assisting TPQ formation. Co2+ and Ni2+ ions are also capable of forming TPQ, though much less efficiently than Cu2+.

Copper amine oxidase (CAO)1 (EC 1.4.3.6) contains a redox-active organic cofactor 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (topa quinone, TPQ) that is essential for catalyzing the oxidative deamination of various primary amines (14). We have demonstrated with Arthrobacter globiformis phenylethylamine oxidase (AGAO) that the TPQ cofactor is post-translationally generated from the precursor tyrosine residue (Tyr382) by a self-catalytic process requiring molecular oxygen and Cu2+ ion (5-7). We have also determined

the crystal structures of AGAO in an inactive apo form without TPQ and Cu2+ ion and an active holo form containing both of them (8). In the apo form structure, the phenolic hydroxyl group of the precursor tyrosine (Tyr382) pointed toward the vacant metal site with the phenoxy oxygen atom of Tyr382 and the imidazole nitrogen atoms of three histidine residues (His431, His433, and His592) arranged in a tetrahedral geometry. In the holo form structure, the nitrogen atoms of the same three histidine residues and a water molecule were placed at an equatorial position, and another water molecule was at an axial position, all coordinating to the Cu2+ ion in the distorted square pyramidal geometry (8). The TPQ ring was tilted away from the copper site in the "off-copper" conformation. By comparing these structures, conformational changes of the active site residues were predicted to occur during the TPQ biogenesis, which were corroborated recently by time-resolved X-ray crystallography (9). Cu2+ ion has so far been believed to be the sole metal ion that can promote the TPQ biogenesis in CAOs (5). Thus,

12042 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 36, 2005 metal ions including Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Be2+, Mo2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ ions were all inert for TPQ formation in AGAO (5). It has been reported that Zn2+ ion is tightly bound to the Cu-binding site of the enzyme from yeast Hansenula polymorpha (HPAO) (10) and prevents TPQ formation by subsequent incubation with excess Cu2+ ions (11). Therefore, the metal ion specificity for TPQ biogenesis should be attributed to the intrinsic properties of the bound metal ions, but not to the nature of the proteins, which can bind several kinds of divalent metal ions besides Cu2+. In further studying the mechanism of TPQ biogenesis in AGAO, we incidentally noticed that the enzyme solution added with Co2+ or Ni2+ ion, which was initially colorless without TPQ, turned pink on storage in a refrigerator over a month, implying that TPQ was formed. This fortuitous observation led us to reinvestigate the metal ion specificity for TPQ biogenesis. We here demonstrate that Cu2+ ion is not the sole metal ion assisting the TPQ formation and that Co2+ and Ni2+ ions are also capable of forming TPQ in AGAO, though much less efficiently than the native Cu2+ ion, requiring a high concentration of dissolved dioxygen. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials. Anhydrous CoCl2 (99.999%, w/w) and NiCl2, 6H2O (99.9999%, w/w) were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available and were used without further purification. All buffers were prepared using water with resistance greater than 16.7 M cm, obtained from a NANOpureII system (Barnstead) and further passed over a Chelex column (BIO-RAD). All glass and plastic wares were thoroughly washed with the Chelex-passed water. Enzyme Purification and Assay. The recombinant AGAO was overproduced in Escherichia coli CD03, a catalasedeficient mutant of E. coli BL21(DE3) (12), carrying the expression vector pEPO-02 and grown in a copper-depleted medium (5). The enzyme was purified in an inactive apo form without TPQ and Cu2+ ion, as described previously (5). The purity was >99% as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the purified enzyme had no detectable catalase activity. The enzyme was assayed at 30 °C in 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.8) with 40 µM 2-phenylethylamine (2-PEA) as substrate by the peroxidase-coupled method, as described previously (5). Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined on the basis of the ping-pong bi-bi mechanism by changing the concentration of 2-PEA, and calculated by fitting the data to nonlinear regression curves of the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kaleidagraph version 3.0 (Abelbeck Software). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 12.3 and 13.2 for 1% (w/v) solutions of the apo and holo forms of AGAO (5), respectively. The TPQ and metal contents in the holo AGAO were determined as described previously (5). TPQ Biogenesis with Various Metal Ions. The apo AGAO (0.1 mM subunit, final concentration) was incubated with various metal ions (0.5 mM, as chloride salt), including Ag+, Ba2+, Be2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cr2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Pd2+, Rb+, Sn2+, Sr2+, and Zn2+, in 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.8) at 30 °C under aerobic conditions in a cuvette. The reaction was monitored by measuring the spectral changes

Okajima et al. of enzyme in the wavelength region of 300-800 nm with a UV-vis spectrophotometer. In the cases where noted, the reaction was done in a cuvette tightly sealed with a screw cap and a silicon rubber septum and pressurized with dioxygen through a needle connected to a balloon containing 99.99% O2 gas. Dissolved oxygen concentration in the reaction mixture measured with a standard Clark-type oxygen electrode was about 1.2 mM at saturation. Spectroscopic Measurements. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded at 30 °C with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diodearray spectrophotometer or a JASCO V-560 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Resonance Raman scattering was excited at 514.5 nm with an Ar+ ion laser (Spectra Physics, 2017) and detected with a CCD detector (Princeton Instruments) attached to a triple polychromator (JASCO, NR-1800). The excitation laser beam power was adjusted to 70 mW at the sample point. Measurements were carried out at an ambient temperature with the enzyme solution (about 50 µL) placed in a spinning cell (3000 rpm). The data accumulation time was 200 s. Raman shifts were calibrated with acetone and toluene, and the resolution of the Raman bands was (1 cm-1. Crystallization and Data Collection. Holo AGAO, in which TPQ was generated by incubation with Co2+ ion (CoAGAO) or Ni2+ ion (Ni-AGAO), was crystallized at 16 °C by the microdialysis method as described previously (8, 12). The protein concentration in the dialysis button (volume, 50 µL) was 10 mg/mL, and the reservoir solution contained 1.05 M potassium sodium tartrate as a precipitant in 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.8). Platelet-like crystals (0.2 × 0.4 × 0.1 mm) appeared within about 2 weeks. The dialysis buttons were then transferred into the same buffer containing 45% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Crystals of apo AGAO were also prepared under the same conditions and soaked in the buffer containing 45% glycerol, which had been thoroughly degassed in an anaerobic glovebox for 1 day. The apo AGAO crystals were further soaked in the same buffer containing 45% glycerol and 5 mM CoCl2 for 16 h before data collection. The crystals were mounted on thin nylon loops (, 0.2-0.3 mm) and frozen by flash cooling at 100 K in a cold N2 gas stream. Diffraction data sets were collected with a synchrotron X-radiation at SPring8 (Hyogo, Japan), at 90 K using an MAR CCD detector in the beam-line station BL44B2 ( ) 0.700 Å) for Co- and Ni-AGAO crystals or at 100 K using an imaging plate DIP6040 (Bruker AXS) in the beam-line station BL44XU ( ) 0.900 Å) for Co-soaked apo AGAO crystals. The collected data were processed, merged, and scaled using Mosflm (13) and SCALA (14). The three crystals were found to belong to a space group I2 with the unit cell dimensions that are comparable to those of the wildtype Cu-activated AGAO (Cu-AGAO) at 100 K (12). The details and statistics of data collection are summarized in Table 1. Structural Refinement. The program used for calculation of electron-density maps and simulated-annealing, positional, and B-factor refinements was X-PLOR version 3.861 (15). Manual rebuilding and assignment of solvent molecules were performed using QUANTA version 97 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). An initial model for AGAO dimer was generated by 180° rotation around the crystallographic 2-fold axis of the monomer coordinates (PDB code, 1AVK) without solvent molecules.

model, electron density maps were calculated after rigidbody refinement. The structures obtained for Co- and NiAGAO and Co-soaked apo AGAO crystals were further refined through simulated annealing at 3000 K and several cycles of positional and B-factor refinements. Metal ions were assigned on the basis of the highest peaks in the respective 2Fo - Fc maps; water molecules and residues in the active site region were carefully modeled using the 2Fo - Fc, Fo - Fc, and omit maps. The details and statistics of crystallographic refinement for Co- and Ni-AGAO and Cosoaked apo AGAO structures are also given in Table 1. RESULTS Binding of Various Metal Ions. We previously investigated the metal ion specificity for self-catalytic formation of the TPQ cofactor in AGAO and found that only Cu2+ ion among various metal ions tested was able to generate TPQ (5). We interpreted that the metal ions other than Cu2+ ion might be inactive simply because they were not bound to the specific metal-binding site of AGAO. To examine this possibility, the metal-free apo AGAO was first incubated with various metal ions (0.5 mM Ag+, Ba2+, Be2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cr2+, Fe2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Pd2+, Rb+, Sn2+, Sr2+, or Zn2+) at 30 °C for 24 h, and further incubated after addition of 0.5 mM Cu2+ ion. In the initial 24 h incubation, there was no increase in the absorption at 480 nm due to TPQ, corroborating that all metal ions besides Cu2+ are inert for TPQ generation as described previously (5). If the preadded metal ion is not bound or only weakly bound to the metal site of AGAO and is therefore readily replaced by Cu2+ ion added subsequently, the TPQ generation reaction should be im-

mediately initiated by the addition of Cu2+ ion. Metal ions including Ag+, Ba2+, Be2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Cr2+, Fe2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Pd2+, Rb+, Sn2+, and Sr2+ ions were found to belong to this group; the Cu2+ ion added later promoted TPQ generation in a manner similar to that without preaddition of noncupric metal ions (Figure 1). Mn2+ ion appeared to be bound to AGAO to a certain extent, as the TPQ generation was significantly retarded, probably following slow exchange with the subsequently added Cu2+ ion. In marked contrast, preincubation with either Co2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ ion resulted in yielding the enzyme that could not form TPQ by the subsequent addition of excess Cu2+ ion, indicating that those latter three metal ions were bound so tightly to the Cubinding site of AGAO that they were not replaced by Cu2+ ion added later. Alternatively, their binding to another site may somehow prevent the specific binding of Cu2+ ion or initiating the TPQ biogenesis by, for example, indirect conformational changes of the active site. However, it seemed more likely that the Cu-binding site of AGAO constituted by three histidine residues (His431, His433, and His592; vide infra) could bind not only Cu2+ ion but also other metal ions such as Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ ions, which were apparently inert for TPQ biogenesis. TPQ Biogenesis Assisted by Co2+ and Ni2+ Ions. It was rather fortunate that we did not discard the above enzyme samples added with various noncupric metal ions and kept them in a refrigerator over a month until we noticed that two of them colored pink, implying the formation of TPQ. The two colored samples were those added with Co2+ and Ni2+ ions but without a second addition of Cu2+ ion. We suspected that Co2+ and Ni2+ ions were also able to assist TPQ generation, albeit extremely inefficiently. Since the TPQ biogenesis reaction is an oxidative modification of the precursor tyrosine residue (Tyr382) and depends on the concentration of dissolved oxygen (16), we then attempted to accelerate the Co2+/Ni2+ ion-assisted TPQ biogenesis by using a high concentration of dissolved oxygen ([O2] at saturation ) ca. 1.2 mM). As shown in Figure 2A and Figure 2B, we could indeed observe slow spectral changes upon addition of 0.5 mM Co2+ or Ni2+ ion in a measurable time

Okajima et al. conditions saturated with dissolved dioxygen. We have purchased the chloride salts of metal ions (CoCl2 and NiCl2) of the highest purity commercially available (99.999%, w/w). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude a possibility of TPQ generation by a trace contaminating Cu2+ ion in the solution of Co2+ and Ni2+ ions. To examine this, a small amount of Cu2+ ion (final concentration, 0.005 or 0.05 mM), far exceeding the upper limit of contamination (0.001%, w/w), was added intentionally to the above metal solutions and the rates of TPQ generation (kobs) were measured by the increase in absorbance at 480 nm (Table 2). Intentional addition of a small amount of Cu2+ ion had essentially no effect on the rates of TPQ generation by Co2+ and Ni2+ ions, clearly showing that the slow generation of TPQ by Co2+ and Ni2+ ions is not due to a trace contaminating Cu2+ ion, if any. Characterization of Co- and Ni-AGAO. To identify the chromophore formed in the Co- and Ni-added AGAO (Coand Ni-AGAO), the apoenzyme was incubated with 0.5 mM Co2+ or Ni2+ ion at 30 °C for 72 h under the conditions saturating with dioxygen ([O2] ) 1.2 mM) and then dialyzed extensively against 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.8) containing 4 mM EDTA. Metal contents determined by atomic absorption spectrometry revealed nearly stoichiometric incorporation of each metal ion, as well as less than 1% contamination of copper (Table 3). Absorption spectra of Co- and Ni-AGAO shown in Figure 3A agreed well with that of Cu-AGAO, having the molar absorption coefficient of about 1800 M-1 cm-1 (max at 480 nm). Resonance Raman spectra of Co- and Ni-AGAO were also very similar to that of Cu-AGAO with characteristic vibrational modes derived from TPQox, such as stretching modes of the C2dO and C5d O carbonyl groups at 1575 cm-1 and 1686 cm-1, respectively (17), together with other lower energy modes observed in the 1200-1400 cm-1 region (CdC and C-C stretching and C-H bending motions) (Figure 3B). The amounts of TPQox in Co- and Ni-AGAO, as determined by titration with phenylhydrazine, were comparable with those of the holo Cu-AGAO (Table 3). Altogether, these data unequivocally show that the chromophore formed in Co- and Ni-AGAO is TPQ. Despite the cofactor formation, Co- and Ni-AGAO showed very low catalytic activities (Table 3). This is consistent with the previous finding that the native Cu2+ ion is required not only for the cofactor biogenesis but also for the catalytic activity (12, 18). Also shown in Table 3 are the steady-state kinetic parameters of Cu-, Co-, and Ni-AGAO. Km values for 2-PEA of Co- and Ni-AGAO were similar to that of the native Cu-enzyme. In contrast, kcat values of Co- and NiAGAO, determined with a saturated concentration of 2-PEA, were considerably lower, suggesting that the bound metal ion participates in the catalytic process, rather than in the substrate binding. We have recently investigated the catalytic role of Cu2+ ion by replacing with various metal ions and proposed that the bound metal ion provides a binding site for the reduced dioxygen species to be efficiently protonated and released during the oxidative half-reaction of the catalytic cycle (12). The low kcat values of Co- and Ni-AGAO are comparable with those of the Co- and Ni-substituted enzymes, prepared by metal substitution of the native Cuenzyme (12), and this result is consistent with the key role of Cu2+ ion in the oxidative half-reaction.

FIGURE 2: Spectral changes during incubation with Co2+ and Ni2+ ions under O2-saturating conditions. Apo AGAO (0.1 mM subunit) was incubated at 30 °C with 0.5 mM Co2+ (A) or Ni2+ (B) under O2-saturating conditions ([O2] ) 1.2 mM). Absorption spectra were recorded at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 h; arrows indicate the direction of the spectral changes.

The absorption maximum at about 480 nm corresponds to max of the oxidized form of TPQ (TPQox) in AGAO (5). Pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) estimated from the increase in absorbance at 480 nm (Figure 2, insets) are given in Table 2. The kobs values for Co2+ and Ni2+ ions are about 1200-fold smaller than that for Cu2+ ion measured under the

X-ray Crystallographic Structures of Co- and Ni-AGAO. To structurally compare with the native Cu-AGAO, X-ray crystallographic structures were determined for Co- and NiAGAO (Table 1). The overall polypeptide folds of Co- and Ni-AGAO were essentially identical with that of the wildtype Cu-AGAO, giving root-mean-square deviations of about 0.5 Å for the coordinates of all main-chain atoms. Most side chains in the Co- and Ni-AGAO structures also maintain the same conformations as those in the Cu-AGAO structure. In the active sites of Co- and Ni-AGAO, Fo - Fc omit maps contoured at (4.0 for residue 382 clearly show that the phenolic side chain has extra electron densities at both of the C2 and C5 positions. Thus, in agreement with the spectroscopic data described above, X-ray structures also revealed that residue 382 had been fully processed to the

TPQ cofactor (Figure 4A and Figure 4B). The modeled TPQ cofactors in Co- and Ni-AGAO are both in an "off-copper" conformation, as shown previously in the active form of CuAGAO (8). As for the metal coordination structure, the Cu2+ ion in Cu-AGAO is 5-coordinated with 3 imidazole nitrogen atoms of His residues (His431, His433, and His592) and 2 oxygen atoms of water molecules arranged in a distorted square pyramidal geometry (8). The bound Co2+ and Ni2+ ions in Co- and Ni-AGAO occupy the same metal site as the Cu2+ ion in the native Cu-enzyme, but are 6-coordinated in an octahedral geometry with 3 imidazole nitrogen atoms of the same His residues and 3 oxygen atoms of water molecules (Wa1, Wa2, and Wa3) (Figure 4A and Figure 4B). This octahedral metal-coordination geometry has also been observed previously in the structures of Co- and Ni-AGAO prepared by metal substitution (12). Furthermore, to structurally visualize the initial stage of the Co2+ ion-assisted biogenesis of TPQ, apo AGAO crystals were soaked anaerobically in the buffer containing 5 mM CoCl2 and subjected to X-ray diffraction studies. As expected, a strong electron density, assignable to the bound Co2+ ion, was observed in the metal-binding site of AGAO. An Fo - Fc omit map contoured at (4.0 clearly shows that Tyr382 remains unprocessed with its 4-hydroxyl group pointing toward the Co2+ ion (Figure 4C). The distance between O-4 atom of Tyr382 and the bound Co2+ ion is about 2.6 Å, which is not close enough to allow a ligand-to-metal change transfer (LMCT). The coordination structure of the Co2+ ion is a trigonal pyramid, consisting of 3 imidazole nitrogen atoms of His residues (His431, His433, and His592) and the phenolic oxygen atom of Tyr382. There is no water molecule directly bound to the Co2+ ion. Thus, the metal coordination structure of the Co-soaked apo AGAO is essentially identical with that of the initial structure formed during the Cu-assisted TPQ biogenesis (bio-1; PDB code, 1IVU) (9). These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of the metal ion assisted TPQ biogenesis in AGAO is essentially the same with Cu2+, Co2+, and probably Ni2+ ions, but differs only in the overall rates of the TPQ generation as described above (Cu2+ . Co2+ g Ni2+, see Table 2). DISCUSSION We have clearly shown here for the first time that generation of the TPQ cofactor in a CAO is assisted not only specifically by Cu2+ ion but also by some other noncupric metal ions, such as Co2+ and Ni2+, though extremely inefficiently as compared with the native Cu2+ ion. Seventeen metal ions examined for TPQ generating activity in the present study are classified into three groups: (1) Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+, which are tightly bound to the specific metalbinding site and are capable of promoting the TPQ biogenesis; (2) Zn2+, which is also tightly bound to the site (i.e.,

unexchangeable with excess Cu2+ ion added later) but is inert for TPQ generation; (3) others which are not or only weakly (e.g., Mn2+) bound and are incapable of generating TPQ. We cannot provide at the moment an appropriate rationale for the metal ion specificity for binding to the specific site of AGAO, commonly applicable to those belonging to groups 1 and 2 (Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+). Presumably, however, they might have a proper ionic radius (not too small or large) that can be accommodated within the cavity of the metal center and also an ability to form a specific, stable metal coordination structure with the protein ligands (His431, His433, His592, and Tyr382) with or without a few molecules of H2O. Also, it is unknown why only the three metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+) are able to assist the TPQ biogenesis, but intrinsic properties of the bound metal ions, such as Lewis acidity, may account for their TPQ-generating abilities as discussed later. Based on the time-resolved X-ray crystallographic studies on the process of Cu-assisted TPQ biogenesis in AGAO (9), we have proposed a mechanism of TPQ generation including

three possible intermediates: a Tyr/Cu2+ complex (not necessarily an LMCT complex) (19), dopa quinone, and TPQ in the reduced trihydroxybenzene form (TPQred). Extensive kinetic studies using yeast HPAO have also proposed a mechanism in which a rate-limiting step in the overall TPQ generation in HPAO is the reaction of the Cu2+-activated precursor Tyr residue with dioxygen prebound at a nonmetal site (20, 21). A linear relationship observed between the dissolved O2 concentration and the rate of TPQ generation suggested that the affinity for O2 of the nonmetal binding site is rather low (21). The rate of Cu2+-assisted TPQ generation in AGAO, as well, increased linearly with the concentration of dissolved O2 (Chiu et al., unpublished data). If there is an O2-prebinding site in AGAO located in some distance from the metal center as proposed for HPAO (21), it is unlikely that the [O2] dependency of the rate of TPQ generation is affected so significantly by the kind of bound metal ions. As demonstrated here, saturating concentrations (1.2 mM) of dissolved O2 are needed for the Co2+/Ni2+ ion-assisted generation of TPQ to proceed at an observable

Metal Ion Specificity for Topa Quinone Biogenesis rate. Thus the initial reaction of the precursor Tyr residue with O2 may be a bimolecular collision, being linearly dependent on the dissolved [O2]. It appears that the reactivity of the metal-activated Tyr toward O2 depends primarily on the intrinsic properties of metal ions with the native Cu2+ ion activating most efficiently. As reported previously in the metal substitution studies on AGAO (12), the metal-free TPQred form of AGAO prepared by reduction with dithionite followed by removal of Cu+ by treatment with cyanide and extensive, anaerobic dialysis can be reoxidized to the active TPQox form by reconstitution with Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ ions, but not with Zn2+ ion. The observed rates of oxidation of TPQred by Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ ions are 1.0, 0.57, and 0.065 min-1, respectively, at 30 °C, pH 6.8, and at an ambient oxygen concentration (12), indicating that the metal ion specificity for this step is less strict than that for the overall TPQ biogenesis with the kobs values of biogenesis assisted by the three metal ions differing by about 1200-fold, as described above. TPQred is also an intermediate immediately preceding the final TPQox in the proposed mechanism of TPQ biogenesis in AGAO (9). Interestingly, these three metal ions are common to those that can initiate the TPQ biogenesis reported here. Therefore, in the TPQ biogenesis the metal ions are required for both the initial oxidative modification (oxygenation) of the precursor Tyr phenol ring and the final 2-electron oxidation of TPQred to TPQox. Metal ion requirement for the latter process has also been demonstrated in a very recent study of divalent metal ion assisted water addition reaction to a dopa quinone model compound forming the TPQ-like corresponding hydroxyquinone (Cu2+ . Zn2+ g Ni2+) (22). More importantly, the same three metal ions are also necessary for the catalytic activity, playing essential roles particularly in the oxidative half-reaction (12). While Zn2+ ion is again inert for the catalytic activity of AGAO, the difference in the catalytic rates of the native Cu2+-enzyme and the Co2+- and Ni2+-reconstituted enzymes is only 70100-fold (12) (see also Table 3). Among physicochemical properties of divalent metal ions, Lewis acidity may account for the different activities of the three metal ions assisting the TPQ generation. When pKa values of a metal-coordinating water are taken as an assessment of Lewis acidity of metal ions, Cu2+ ion (pKa ) 7.5) has a value two pH units lower than that of Co2+ (pKa ) 9.6) and Ni2+ (pKa ) 9.4) ions (23); Cu2+-coordinating water is 100-fold more dissociated than those coordinating to Co2+ and Ni2+ at neutral pH. The initial intermediate in the TPQ biogenesis is probably the precursor Tyr (Tyr382 in AGAO) with its 4-OH group axially coordinating to the bound Cu2+ ion (9). Although the distance (2.5 Å) between the O-4 atom of Tyr382 and bound Cu2+ ion estimated from the crystal structure is not short enough for an LMCT interaction, the higher Lewis acidity of Cu2+ ion would be advantageous for activation of the Tyr phenol ring to a partially electron-deficient state through the O-4 atom. Formation of a Tyr radical (Tyr·) by full 1e--transfer to Cu2+ may also allow the facile reaction of Cu1+ with O2 yielding superoxide (O2-), which then reacts readily with Tyr·, but this is only feasible with Cu2+; 1e--reduction of Co2+ and Ni2+ to Co1+ and Ni1+, respectively, is energetically unlikely because of their very low reduction potentials. The redox role of metals also appears to be ruled out in view of the

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 36, 2005 12047 recent observation that TPQ is generated in the Cu1+-added precursor form of HPAO at a rate even 16-fold slower than in the Cu2+-added form, suggesting that Cu1+ must be first oxidized to Cu2+ by O2 to initiate the efficient TPQ generation (24). However, the Lewis acidity of metals alone does not explain the inability of Zn2+ ion for TPQ generation [and also for catalyzing amine oxidation in AGAO (12)]; the pKa value of Zn2+-coordinating water (pKa ) 9.6) is comparable with that of Co2+-coordinating water. Therefore, despite much less favorable redox potentials of Co2+ and Ni2+ for 1e--reduction compared to Cu2+, the redox nature of metals may still be a component of the mechanism of TPQ biogenesis, as the redox inactive Zn2+ ion does not support biogenesis. A very recent review article has also provided an unpublished observation that the redox active Ni2+ ion, but not the inactive Zn2+ ion, can support TPQ biogenesis in HPAO (24). Provided that the previously proposed mechanism that involves a redox change of Cu2+ to Cu1+ (8) is operative in the copper-assisted TPQ biogenesis, another possibility that a different, but much less efficient, metal mediated mechanism without involving a redox change occurs in the case of Co2+ and Ni2+ ions also cannot be ruled out. Alternatively, the metal ion specificity may somehow be associated with the versatility of the coordination structure afforded by each metal ion, as typically observed during the Cu2+-assisted process of the TPQ generation in AGAO (9). The Cu2+ ion bound initially to the precursor form of AGAO in the absence of O2 is coordinated in a trigonal pyramid geometry with 4 ligands including 3 imidazole nitrogen atoms of His residues (His431, His433, and His592) and the 4-hydoxyl oxygen atom of Tyr382 (precursor to TPQ), whereas it is coordinated in a distorted square pyramidal geometry with 5 ligands (the same 3 His residues and 2 water molecules) in the mature TPQ-containing active form (9). This versatility of the Cu2+-coordination structure is mainly provided by the conformational flexibility of His592 (19). It is interesting to note that the affinity for anion (e.g., azide) of the Cu2+ ion bound to apo HPAO in the absence of O2 is 2 orders of magnitude greater than the same Cu2+ ion in the mature enzyme in the presence of O2 (25). The anionic affinity of metal is closely related to its Lewis acidity. Therefore, if the coordination structures of the bound Cu2+ ion in the apo and mature forms of HPAO are analogous to those in the corresponding forms of AGAO, this observation suggests that the Lewis acidity is affected significantly by the metal coordination structure. Thus the much stronger anion affinity ()Lewis acidity) of Cu2+ ion bound to apo HPAO, likely reflecting the role of Cu2+ ion in activating the precursor Tyr, may be attained in combination with its trigonal pyramid geometry. Although the Co2+ ion (and presumably Ni2+) bound to apo AGAO has a coordination structure similar to Cu2+ as described above, its Lewis acidity may be too weak to efficiently activate the precursor Tyr. However, the metal coordination structure again fails to explain the inability of Zn2+ ion for TPQ generation, as the Zn2+ ion bound to apo HPAO is 4-coordinated in a trigonal pyramid geometry like the Cu2+ and Co2+ ions bound to apo AGAO (10). In conclusion, the present studies have demonstrated that common divalent metal ions are required for both the self-

12048 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 36, 2005 processing generation of the TPQ cofactor and the catalytic activity of AGAO. Although there is a marginal but noticeable difference in the metal ion specificity for catalysis among CAOs from different sources [e.g., the Co2+substituted form of HPAO catalyzes amine oxidation with nearly the same kcat as the wild-type Cu2+-containing form (26), while the same metal form of AGAO possesses only 2% kcat of Cu2+-AGAO (12)], Cu2+ is the best metal ion that efficiently promotes both the TPQ biogenesis and catalysis for all CAOs. If the metal ion specificities for TPQ biogenesis (1200-fold) and catalysis (70-100-fold) are combined, Cu2+ ion is about 100000-fold preferred by AGAO to Co2+ and Ni2+ ions. Although Co2+ and Ni2+ ion-assisted TPQ biogenesis demonstrated here may be biologically insignificant because of the requirement of such a high concentration of dissolved O2, the markedly high preference for Cu2+ ion well rationalizes the natural selection of this particular metal among those (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) showing similar natural abundance. Also, we would like to emphasize that comparative studies using various metal ions as employed here can only provide a clue to answer a general question, "why is copper, not other metals, used in copper proteins?", or a more specific one, "what property of copper is most important for TPQ biogenesis and catalysis of copper amine oxidase?" An answer for the latter question may be its high Lewis acidity exhibited in cooperation with the coordination structure in the protein. REFERENCES
