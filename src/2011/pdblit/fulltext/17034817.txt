Mouse 17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (AKR1C21) Binds Steroids Differently from other Aldo-keto Reductases: Identification and Characterization of Amino Acid Residues Critical for Substrate Binding

Oncology and Molecular Endocrinology Research Center, Laval University Medical Center (CHUL) and Laval University, Québec (QC), Canada G1V 4G2 The mouse 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (m17-HSD) is the unique known member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily able to catalyze efficiently and in a stereospecific manner the conversion of androstenedione (4) into epi-testosterone (epi-T), the 17-epimer of testosterone. Structural and mutagenic studies had already identified one of the residues delineating the steroid-binding cavity, A24, as the major molecular determinant for the stereospecificity of m17-HSD. We report here a ternary complex crystal structure (m17-HSD:NADP + :epi-T) determined at 1.85 Å resolution that confirms this and reveals a unique steroid-binding mode for an AKR enzyme. Indeed, in addition to the interactions found in all other AKRs (van der Waals contacts stabilizing the core of the steroid and the hydrogen bonds established at the catalytic site by the Y55 and H117 residues with the oxygen atom of the ketone group to be reduced), m17-HSD establishes with the other extremity of the steroid nucleus an additional interaction involving K31. By combining direct mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we found that the elimination of this hydrogen bond did not affect the affinity of the enzyme for its steroid substrate but led to a slight but significant increase of its catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), suggesting a role for K31 in the release of the steroidal product at the end of the reaction. This previously unobserved steroid-binding mode for an AKR is similar to that adopted by other steroid-binding proteins, the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family and the steroid hormone nuclear receptors. Mutagenesis and structural studies made on the human type 3 3-HSD, a closely related enzyme that shares 73% amino acids identity with the m17-HSD, also revealed that the residue at position 24 of these two enzymes directly affects the binding and/or the release of NADPH, in addition to its role in their 17/17 stereospecificity.

Introduction
Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) play an important role in the synthesis and inactivation of all classes of steroid hormones. They exist in multiple isoforms, which are differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner. This, coupled with the activity of each isoform as either a reductase or a dehydrogenase, can determine the role of the

526 enzyme in influencing the steroid hormone. Based on amino acid sequence homologies, the HSDs characterized to date have been classified into two distinct protein superfamilies: the short chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs)1,2 and the aldoketo reductases (AKRs).3,4 Although they catalyze similar and, in some cases, identical reactions and although they exert their activity on similar, or sometimes, identical substrates, these two families share no significant sequence identity or structural homology. One notable difference between the AKRs and the SDRs is the structural motifs involved in binding the cofactor NAD+ or NADPH. The AKRs adopt an /-barrel fold with a cylindrical core of eight parallel -stands surrounded by eight -helices running antiparallel to the strands. The cofactor binds the AKR enzymes at the C-terminal end of the -sheet.5,6 The cofactor-binding domain of the SDR enzymes contains an open twisted -sheet surrounded by -helices on both sides to form what is commonly known as the Rossmann nucleotidebinding fold.7 Another important functional characteristic differentiating them is the manner by which enzymes of these two protein families bind their steroid substrates. Crystal structures of enzyme-steroid complexes have revealed that the steroid-binding cavity of the AKR enzymes is mainly composed of residues that belong to loops connecting -strands to -helices at the top of the -barrel. These structural elements form a wide open cone through which the steroid substrates can easily reach the catalytic site of the enzyme. Through numerous hydrophobic interactions, the aromatic and aliphatic residues delineating this cavity stabilize and orient the steroid nucleus perpendicular to the barrel. When engaged in this cavity, the steroid is thereby forced to adopt a position allowing the oxygen atom of the ketone group to be reduced to form a hydrogen-bond network with residues Y55 and H117; Y55 being the central residue in this network, since it acts as the proton acceptor/donor.8 In this position, almost half of the steroid nucleus is loosely maintained by the enzyme while the rest of the molecule remains outside the cavity (Figure 1(a)). This, combined with the fact that these enzymes are able to adapt the structure of their binding cavity, probably explains why enzymes of the AKR superfamily are not very specific and can bind/transform numerous molecules with various shapes. 9 The steroid-binding site of the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the SDR superfamily is quite different, since it appears as a deeper and narrower cavity engulfing the steroid nucleus almost completely (Figure 1(b)). For example, in the human type 1 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase structure, a representative SDR and the first HSD of this family to have its ternary complex structure (enzyme:cofactor:steroid) determined,10 both extremities of the steroid molecule are mainly stabilized by hydrogen bonds with polar amino acids (Figure 1(c)), while its core is maintained with several

hydrophobic interactions involving aromatic and aliphatic residues. The steroid-binding mode of SDR enzymes is in fact very similar to that of nuclear receptors (Figure 1(d)), which bind their respective steroid hormones with very high affinity (i.e. binding constants in the low nanomolar range). The differences observed in the steroid-binding mode between these two HSD superfamilies have been pointed at to explain the more pronounced functional plasticity11 or multifunctionality12 of the AKR. Here we report the structural characterization of an AKR, the mouse 17-HSD enzyme in ternary complex with the cofactor and the steroid. This enzyme has been recently characterized as the 21st member of the AKR1C subfamily (AKR1C21)13 and as the unique HSD able to catalyze efficiently and in a stereospecific manner the conversion of androstenedione (4) into epi-testosterone (epi-T), the 17hydroxy epimer of testosterone.14 Against all expectations, we found that the manner in which the m17-HSD binds the steroid molecule differs from that of all other AKR enzymes, notably the human type 3 3-HSD (h3-HSD3), a closely related enzyme that shares 73% amino acid identity with the mouse 17-HSD. To better understand the reason for this difference in steroid binding, we have also performed mutagenic studies and proceeded to structural and functional characterization of the mutant enzymes.

Results and Discussion
Crystallization of the m17-HSD in the presence of NADPH and androstenedione and overall description of the protein structure Ternary complex crystals of m17-HSD were obtained by crystallizing the enzyme in the presence of NADPH and 4 (see Materials and Methods for crystallization conditions). However, because the steroid ligand present in the protein solution used during the crystallization process did not yield full occupancy of the ligand-binding site, 4 (1 mM) was added to the cryoprotective solution (the crystallization solution containing 20% ethylene glycol) where crystals of m17-HSD were soaked prior to diffraction experiments. Crystals of m17HSD in ternary complex belong to the monoclinic space group P21 with unit-cell dimensions a = 49.2, b = 97.4, c = 79.5 Å,  = 99.3°. A near-complete diffraction data set was collected to 1.85 Å resolution for one of these crystals (see Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics). A good molecular replacement solution (correlation factor of 68.3%) was found using, as a search model, atomic coordinates of the m17-HSD in binary complex (2HEJ).15 This allowed us to obtain well-defined electron density maps for the two molecules per asymmetric unit. Using these maps, the two m17-HSD molecules were reconstructed and refined to a crystallographic

R-factor of 0.171 (Rfree = 0.200). The final model lacks the first five residues for each monomer. The backbone dihedral angles of 93.4% of the residues are found in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot.16 Only T221 is in the disallowed regions, its main chain being involved in a hydrogen bond with one of the cofactor central phosphate groups. The m17-HSD ternary complex structure determined here presents no major difference from that of the binary complex (RCSB PDB code 2HEJ) previously reported.15 This is notably the case for the three longer loops (named A, B, and C according to their position in the primary amino acid sequence; loop A includes residues 118­143, loop B 217­238, and loop C 299­323 in the mouse 17-HSD structure), all located at the C-terminal end of the -barrel (Figure 2). These loops are essential for the binding of the cofactor6 and for the recognition and

binding of the steroid substrate.17 The steroidbinding site appears as a large conical cavity with its larger opening at the top of the -barrel while its tip corresponds to the catalytic site of the enzyme. As observed in the crystal structure of the other AKR1C enzymes, the opening of this cavity in the m17-HSD structure appears exaggeratedly large in comparison with the size of a steroid molecule. This, with the fact that the inherent mobility of the loop structures locally modify the shape of this cavity, explains why the steroid is frequently found in multiple positions in the binding site of AKR1C enzymes (see below). In addition to the cofactor and steroid molecules, the final model also contains 692 water molecules, six molecules of -mercaptoethanol forming mixed disulfides with C7, C29, and C145 of each monomer, three molecules of ethylene glycol (one in each monomer and the last one at their interface) and

one molecule of Tris interacting with residues of monomer A. Cofactor and steroid-binding sites Interestingly, from the very start of the refinement process, clear and well-defined 2Fo­Fc electron densities corresponding to cofactor and steroid ligands were visible in each monomer. Subsequently, the structures of NADPH and 4 were unambiguously fitted in the Fourier difference density map and then refined with the rest of the model. Very rapidly, it clearly appeared that the electronic density for the steroid molecule corresponded to epi-T and not to the 4 added during the crystallization step. Indeed, the electronic density shape around the C17 atom showed that the O17 atom was no longer in the plan formed by atoms C13, C17, and C16, indicating that the ketone group had been reduced (Figure 3). Moreover, the high resolution of the diffraction data (1.85 Å) allowed us to identify precisely the position of the O17 atom compared to that of the carbon atoms of the steroid nucleus, thus leading to the identification of epi-T, the 17-epimer of testosterone. Consequently, if we assume that the reduced cofactor (NADPH) added

during crystallization has been consumed by the reduction reaction, the cofactor molecule bound to the enzyme in our ternary complex structure likely is the oxidized form (NADP+). In our ternary complex structure, the epi-T is maintained in the steroid-binding cavity of the m17-HSD in a position that is very probably that adopted by the steroid just after the reduction reaction occurred. Indeed, the steroid molecule is oriented with its reactive ketone group (on the C17) atom pointing toward the bottom of the cavity, at close proximity of the Y55 and H117 residues, two members of the catalytic tetrad. In fact, the O17 atom is hydrogen bonded to H117-N2 atom (3.00 Å and 2.98 Å in the monomers A and B, respectively) while it is at 3.44 Å and 3.40 Å (monomers A and B, respectively) from the hydroxyl group of Y55 (Figure 4(a)). This strikingly differs from the other AKR1C enzymes for which the structure has been determined in ternary complex with a steroid substrate, namely AKR1C1 (human 20-HSD/20OHProg 18 ), AKR1C2 (human type 3 3-HSD/ testosterone19), AKR1C3 (human type 5 17-HSD/ testosterone or androstenedione20), AKR1C5 (rabbit 20-HSD/testosterone21 ), and AKR1C9 (rat 3aHSD/testosterone22). Indeed in all these structures,

the steroid molecule, generally the product of the reaction, was found either too far away (more than 5 Å) from the catalytic site18,20 and/or in an orientation that is not the one adopted by the steroid when the reduction takes place. In this last case, it appears that the product of the reaction had been released by the enzyme then bound again with its other extremity toward the catalytic Y55 residue.19,21,22 In fact, only the rabbit 20-HSD and rat 3-HSD structures have their steroid molecule bound in a productive position, that is, a position allowing the reduction reaction to occur with the ketone group maintained parallel to the nicotinamide head of the NADPH and the oxygen atom at a perfect distance from the hydroxyl group of the Y55 side-chain.21,22 However, in these two structures, the testosterone formed from the reduction of androstenedione (reduction of the C17-ketone group) has its C3-ketone group toward the active site and perfectly positioned for its 3-reduction. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the reaction occurs given the 4-unsaturation found on this steroid. Besides, it was proposed that this orientation could correspond

to an inhibitory position of Testo, which has been found to act as competitive inhibitor for the reduction of 5-DHT by rat 3-HSD.22 Seen in that light, the present m17-HSD structure must thus be considered as the first ternary complex structure determined for an AKR1C enzyme with its steroid molecule (substrate/product) bound in a productive position that coincides with the position where the enzyme exerts its activity (here the 17 activity) and at a suitable distance to interact with the catalytic Y55 residue. Moreover, the steroid is also in a near optimal orientation in relation to the NADP + molecule, since its C17 atom is separated by 3.5 Å from the C4 atom of the nicotinamide head of the cofactor and at an angle of about 120° with the pyridine ring (Figure 4(a)). Heredia et al.23 have determined that this optimal orientation of the reacting atoms is obtained when the carbon atom of the target ketone group is maintained at about 3.0 Å from the C4 atom of the pyridine head of the cofactor and when a line joining these two atoms makes an angle of about 100° with the pyridine head.

Epi-T (in standard CPK colour set), the product of the 17-reduction of androstenedione (in green), has been unambiguously identified using a 2Fo­Fc map contoured at 1. The shape of the electronic density around the C17 atom suggests that the O17 atom is no longer in the plan formed by atoms C13, C17, and C16, indicating that the ketone group has been reduced and confirming that the steroid in our m17-HSD ternary complex structure is epi-T. The Figure was generated with Molscript and Raster3D.40,41

Previously unobserved steroid-binding mode One of the most outstanding characteristics of this ternary complex structure is certainly the manner in which the m17-HSD stabilizes the steroid in its binding pocket. Indeed, thorough examination of the interactions established between the enzyme and the epi-T molecule reveals that, in addition to the typical contacts found in all AKR1C enzyme/ substrate complexes (namely the hydrogen bonds established by residues of the catalytic site (Y55 and H117) with the oxygen atom of the ketone/hydroxyl group to reduce/oxidize and the numerous hydrophobic contacts between the core of the steroid nucleus and the hydrophobic residues of the steroid

binding cavity), m17-HSD also interacts with the distal extremity of the steroid nucleus (O3 atom), probably to better stabilize it. These additional interactions involve residues K31 (N atom, 2.91 Å) and N56 (N atom via a water molecule), which are hydrogen bonded to the O3 atom of epi-T (Figure 4(a)). This binding mode, with the steroid maintained by its extremities (O3 and O17), has never been observed in any other AKR1C enzyme ternary complex structure even if the K31 and N56 residues are very well conserved among members of this subfamily. Indeed, in the amino acid sequence of AKR1C enzymes, position 31 is always occupied by a basic residue (lysine or arginine), whereas asparagine or glutamine is generally found at position 56

(only AKR1C5 differs with its K56). However, in the ternary complex structures of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2, two enzymes having lysine and aspartate residues at positions 31 and 56, the distal extremity

of the steroid occupies a position too distant to allow any contact with these residues.18,19 The possibility for residues K31 and N56 of these three enzymes to interact with the distal extremity of the steroid thus

532 seems to depend on the position of the steroid itself. Very recently, we have reported that one of the residues delineating the steroid-binding cavity of m17-HSD, A24, was the major molecular determinant for the stereospecificity of the reduction reaction performed on the ketone groups situated at position 17 as it dictates the particular orientation of the steroid substrate into the catalytic site.15 The m17-HSD crystal structure reported here is in perfect agreement with this finding since the alanine residue at position 24 is small enough to allow the steroid nucleus to bind the enzyme at the putative catalytic position for the 17-reduction reaction but also to permit the distal extremity of the steroid to establish contacts with K31 and N56 residues. A bulkier residue at position 24, such as the tyrosine found in the majority of the other AKR1C enzymes including AKR1C1 and AKR1C2, thus prevents the steroid from adopting the particular position observed in the m17-HSD structure. If it appears to be unique to the m17-HSD among the AKR1C subfamily, this steroid-binding mode is nevertheless the one prevailing in many other steroid-binding proteins. This is, for example, the case for the human estrogenic type 1 17-HSD (h17-HSD1), a member of the SDR superfamily that maintains the steroid in an almost closed cavity and stabilizes it by hydrogen bonds with polar atoms at both ends (O3 and O17) (Figure 1(c)) in addition to several hydrophobic interactions involving hydrophobic residues located all around the steroid nucleus.10 The steroid hormone receptors also bind their steroid ligands this way24­26 and the importance of these interactions established by the receptors with the extremities of the steroid molecules (Figure 1(d)) could greatly account for the high binding affinity for their steroidal ligands.27 Moreover, the elimination of one of these interactions has been found to alter the specificity of the receptor toward its ligands in addition to changing its functional activity. For example, the human androgen receptor found in specimens obtained from men with metastatic carcinoma of the prostate28 often contains a mutation that suppresses the interaction between the receptor and one of the steroid extremities and that confers agonist activity to molecules normally antagonist for the wild-type androgen receptor. In addition to being firmly maintained by hydrogen bonds at both ends, somewhat like a hammock, the nucleus of epi-T appears to be also tightly packed in the binding pocket of m17-HSD mainly formed by residues A24, L25, L27, Y118, F129, Y224, and W227 (Figure 5(a)). The side-chains of Y224 and W227 residues form one side of this pocket and are arranged in such a manner that they give a "V

Mouse 17-HSD/NADP +/epi-Testosterone Structure

shape" to this pocket side. Interestingly, the two methyl groups (C18 and C19) of the epi-T molecule fit perfectly in the hydrophobic bottom of this groove, thus reducing the possibility of lateral movement. Moreover, because it goes from the opening of the steroid-binding cavity to the catalytic site, this groove can be seen as a rail guiding the incoming steroid toward the active site of m17HSD (Figure 5(b)). Compared to those of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2, the steroid-binding cavity of m17HSD is also narrower because of the presence of residues with bulkier side-chains. For example, on one side of the steroid, residue F129 (Figure 6) in the m17-HSD sequence establishes closer contacts with ring B (C6 and C7) of the steroid nucleus than the isoleucine residue found at this position in the two other enzymes. At the opposite side, Y224 exerts similar pressure against ring C (C11 and C12), whereas the more flexible side-chain of the glutamate residue at position 224 in AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 enzymes points toward the opening of the cavity. By narrowing the steroid-binding site, these two residues probably prevent the steroid from adopting multiple positions in the cavity as it was observed in the ternary complex structure of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C3 enzymes.18,20 Among residues delimiting the binding cavity of these three enzymes, only residue 24 is smaller in the m17-HSD structure (alanine versus tyrosine). This creates additional room at the end of the cavity, near the catalytic site of the m17-HSD enzyme, permitting the steroid to adopt the perfect position for its stereospecific 17-reduction. Put together, all these structural elements (the hydrophobic groove that guides the steroid toward the catalytic site; the presence of bulkier residues on both sides of the steroid (F129 and Y224), which reduce significantly the lateral movement of the steroid nucleus; and the additional room at the end of the cavity due to the presence of a residue with a smaller side-chain (A24)) probably contribute to push the steroid inside its binding cavity with its C17-ketone group pointing toward the catalytic site (Figures 5 and 6). This, with the previously unobserved steroid binding mode observed in the m17-HSD involving K31 and N56 residues, also certainly contributes to maintain the epi-T molecule, the product of the reaction, inside the steroid site at the end of the reaction, a situation that had never been seen for any other AKR1C enzyme. Importance of K31 for steroid binding: mutagenic, kinetic, and structural experiments To better determine the role of K31 in epi-T stabilisation, we performed two different mutations

(K31M and K31A) in order to eliminate the hydrogen bond found between the side-chain of this residue and the O3 atom of epi-T. Surprisingly, kinetic assays revealed that the affinity of both mutant enzymes for the steroid substrate (4) was very close to that of the wild-type m17-HSD, as indicated by their Km values (Table 2). This hydrogen bond thus likely plays a much less important role than envisaged in the stabilization of the newly entered steroid molecule in the steroidbinding cavity. On the other hand, the turnover number and, by this very fact, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of mutant enzymes was slightly but significantly higher than that of the wild-type

enzyme. We can thus suppose that this bond slows the release of the steroidal product at the end of the reaction. It also appears that the size of the sidechain at position 31 (methionine versus alanine) has an impact on the turnover number (46.6 min- 1 and 39.7 min- 1 for the K31A and K31M mutant enzymes, respectively). From a structural point of view, this could be explained by obstruction of the passage of the steroid by the bulkier side-chain of the methionine residue located near the exit of the steroid-binding cavity. These kinetic studies thus suggest that the hydrogen bond established between the N atom of K31 and the O3 atom of the steroid is important, most likely for the stabilisation of the steroid molecule produced after the reduction reaction. We also proceeded to structural studies of one of these mutants (17-HSD(K31A)) crystallized in the presence of 4 and NADPH in order to visualize the eventual impact of an absence of the hydrogen bond between K31 and the steroid on the position of the latter in the steroid-binding cavity. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. In the 2Fo­Fc map, the electronic density corresponding to the side-chain of residue 31 has

535 occurs). However, our kinetic studies have already indicated that, if this interaction exists between m17-HSD and 4, it does not contribute importantly to the steroid stabilization, since its suppression does not affect the affinity of the mutated enzymes for 4 (Table 2). It must be also considered that, if this interaction occurs only with the product of the reduction reaction, here epi-T, it could play a role in the product release at the end of the reaction. On the other hand, because this enzyme can catalyze the reverse reaction (transformation of 17-OH steroids into 17-keto derivatives), this interaction could also be necessary to perfectly position the 17-OH-substrate for the oxidation reaction. Characterization of the dual roles played by the residue at position 24 in the stereospecificity of the reaction and in cofactor binding The m17-HSD is the only enzyme of the AKR superfamily known to be able to reduce the 17-keto steroids to their 17-hydroxy derivatives. The other AKR enzymes known to significantly reduce C17 ketone groups, such as h3-HSD3,29 the human and mouse 17-HSD type 5,20 and the rabbit 20-HSD,30 only produce 17-hydroxy derivatives. As demonstrated by mutagenesis experiments performed on the m17-HSD and h3-HSD3,15 the amino acid at position 24 appears to be the major molecular

permitted us to confirm the presence of the K31A mutation. In both monomers, a clear electronic density corresponding to the B, C, and D rings of the steroid nucleus was also visible. The shape of this density has been used to unambiguously orient the steroid molecule and to identify the steroid as epi-T. O17 atom was always H-bonded to Y55 and H117. Interestingly and contrarily to what we had observed in the wild-type m17-HSD ternary complex described above, only fragments of density corresponding to ring A were visible, suggesting that this part of the steroid nucleus was disordered, probably because the hydrogen bond between O3 (ring A) and the mutant enzyme was not possible. While comparing the position of epi-T in these two structures (Figure 7), we also noted that the orientation of the steroid nucleus was slightly modified, suggesting that K31 pulls the steroid when establishing an interaction with the O3 atom. This attractive movement must certainly contribute to the stabilisation of the epi-T, especially ring A. If we have clearly demonstrated that the interaction between the enzyme (K31) and the steroidal product of the reaction (ketone group on C3 atom) is real and has an impact on both the steroid orientation and the enzymatic catalysis efficiency, there remains, however, to determine if a similar interaction exists between the enzyme and the steroidal substrate (i.e. before the reduction reaction

536 determinant for the stereospecificity of the reduction reaction performed on the C17-ketone group, since substitution of the A24 by a tyrosine­ (the residue found in the h3-HSD3 sequence) completely reverses the stereospecificity of the m17-HSD which then produces only testosterone (17-epimer) instead of epi-T (17-epimer). We thus decided to perform steady-state kinetic studies using our purified enzyme preparation in order to better characterize the role of this residue in the 17- and 17-HSD reductive activities. We compared the kinetic constant values obtained for the reduction of 4 into testosterone by m17-HSD with those of the h3-HSD3 and with the mutant forms of these two enzymes (m17-HSD(A24Y) and h3-HSD3(Y24A)). As seen in Table 3, the most catalytically efficient enzyme for the reduction of the C17-ketone group of 4 is the wild-type m17-HSD enzyme with a kcat/Km value of 1.146 min- 1 M- 1. Mutation of A24 into a tyrosine affects both the affinity of m17-HSD for its steroid substrate (increase of Km value more than sixfold) and its catalytic constant (kcat is decreased tenfold) resulting in a marked decrease of the catalytic efficiency (65fold for 4 reduction) as compared to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 3). As explained above, these changes in the catalytic properties of the mutated m17-HSD enzyme are likely due to the presence of a bulkier residue at the bottom of the steroid-binding cavity preventing 4 from occupying the perfect position for its 17-reduction, that is, permitting only its 17-reduction, but with a lower efficiency. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the m17HSD(A24Y) for the transformation of 4 into testosterone is comparable with that of the wild-type h3-HSD3 (kcat/Km value of 0.0177 min- 1 M- 1 and 0.049 min- 1 M- 1, respectively). Surprisingly, we also found that the mutated h3HSD3(Y24A) enzyme form displays only a partial reversion of its stereospecificity.15 Indeed, h3HSD3(Y24A) still transforms 4 into testosterone with a very high efficiency (Table 3) but also produces 17-epimer (epi-T), confirming that this residue has also an importance for the 17-activity of this enzyme. In fact, when we analyze thoroughly our results, we find that testosterone appears very rapidly at the beginning of the reaction and reaches a maximum after only a few minutes. Thence, epi-T is produced and accumulates to become the major

product in the reaction mixture. This strongly suggests that the mutated h3-HSD3(Y24A) enzyme also possesses a strong and stereospecific oxidative activity on 17-OH steroids allowing it to retransform testosterone into 4 with a high efficiency and giving 4 another chance to be reduced into epi-T. The accumulation of epi-T while the reaction occurs explains very well why this steroid was found in the binding site of the h3-HSD3(Y24A) enzyme when we determined its structure (see below). To produce 17 and 17-derivatives, the h3-HSD3(Y24A) enzyme must bind 4 in two different orientations. For the 17-activity, the steroid D-ring must be maintained parallel to the nicotinamide head of the NADPH, its -face exposed to the cofactor with its C17 at the appropriate distance from the nicotinamide C4 atom for the hydride transfer and its O17 at a position allowing the electrophilic attack of the Y55 O proton. For the 17-activity, the -face of the steroid must be exposed to the nicotinamide head of the cofactor, the C17 and O17 atoms of the ketone group to be reduced being approximately at the same position with respect to C4 atom of the cofactor and the O atom of Y55, respectively. The h3-HSD3(Y24A) mutant enzyme binds 4 with a slightly lower affinity than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 3), but, surprisingly, the steroid is bound with very similar affinities, whether it is for its 17 or its 17reduction. In addition, the kcat value of h3-HSD3 (Y24A) for the 17-reduction of 4 is 20-fold that of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the additional room provided by the substitution of the bulkier Y24 by an alanine allows the steroid ketone group to adopt a more optimal position for its reduction. All these data clearly demonstrate that the residue at position 24 in the m17-HSD and h3-HSD3 structures is definitively a major molecular determinant for the 17/17 stereospecificity of the reduction reaction catalyzed by these enzymes. Unexpectedly, our kinetic studies have also shown that the mutation of residue 24 in the m17-HSD enzyme affects considerably the dissociation constant (Kd) for NADPH. Indeed, the Kd value of the m17-HSD(A24Y) mutant is eight times that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 4). Although structural studies performed on wild-type h3-HSD3 and m17-HSD enzymes had shown that residue 24 does not make any direct contact with the NADPH molecule, we found that it could be involved in the stabilization of the cofactor by participating to the maintenance of loop B in its closed conformation.15 Once closed, loop B establishes interactions with residues of the loop connecting 1 to 1 (residues 24 to 31 in the m17-HSD amino acids sequence) in order to lock the cofactor in its binding site by forming the so-called "safety belt"5 over the central phosphate groups of the NADPH molecule. The safety belt constitutes a structural characteristic of the AKR enzymes and, although residues that form this bridge vary from one enzyme to another, one or two charged residues are always present in order to create a charged hydrogen bond or a salt-bridge that

537 As anticipated, the presence of an alanine residue at position 24 in the h3-HSD3 structure changes the hydrogen bond network at the interface of loops

contributes to maintaining loop B in its closed conformation. For example, in the h3-HSD3 binary complex, the side-chain of one of the loop B residues (E224) establishes three hydrogen bonds with the O atom of Y24, with the NH group of A27, and with the carboxyl group of E28 (Figure 8(a)). In m17HSD, no charged residues are oriented in a direction permitting the formation of such a bond, which could stabilize loop B in the closed conformation. The two loops are instead mainly joined through van der Waals contacts and by a sole hydrogen bond (between the main chain of A24 and the side-chain (atom N2) of Q222 (Figure 8(b))). On the whole, these interactions appear much more weaker than those found in the h3-HSD3 and in the other AKR enzymes. To visualize the conformational modification brought about by the substitution of Y24 by an alanine in the h3-HSD3 structure and to establish the exact role played by this residue in the stabilization of loops structure over the cofactor, we next determined the crystal structure of the h3HSD3(Y24A) mutant enzyme (see Materials and Methods for crystallization conditions and Table 1 for refinement statistics). During the refinement process, the shape of the electron density allows us to unambiguously identify the bound steroid molecule as epi-T and to position it. Interestingly, as observed in the m17-HSD ternary complex structure (described above), the epi-T molecule is perfectly orientated with its O17 facing and at perfect distance from the catalytic Y55 (2.89 Å) and H117 (2.70 Å) residues to establish two hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the -face of the steroid is exposed to the cofactor with its C17 at the appropriate distance (3.13 Å) from the nicotinamide C4 atom for the hydride transfer, a position that perfectly corresponds to the 17-activity possessed by the mutant h3-HSD3(Y24A) enzyme.15 In addition, as in the m17-HSD structure, the distal extremity (O3) of epi-T also interacts with the enzyme (carboxy group of the main chain of V54) via a water molecule (Figure 4(b)). Although the residues involved in this interaction with the steroid are different (K31 and N56 for the m17-HSD and V54 for the mutated h3-HSD3(Y24A), this finding supports very well our hypothesis according to which the presence of a residue with a small sidechain at position 24 (A24), giving the necessary room to the steroid to adopt this particular position in the enzyme-binding cavity, is the main condition allowing this additional contact between the enzyme and its steroid substrate.

538 B and 1­1. Indeed, of the three hydrogen bonds observed in the wild-type enzyme (Figure 8(a)) only one (the one between the carboxyl groups of E28 and E224) is conserved in the mutated h3-HSD3 (Y24A) enzyme (Figure 8(c)), a situation that is strongly similar to that found in the m17-HSD structure (Figure 8(b)). It is very likely that a diminution in the number of hydrogen bonds between loops B and 1­1 can influence the strength of the enzyme­cofactor interaction and have a major impact on the stabilization of the safety-belt in a closed conformation. This is supported by the fact that the Kd value of h3-HSD3(Y24A) is nearly fourfold lower than that of the wild-type h3-HSD3 (Table 4), confirming that the change in the interaction at the interface of loop B and loop 1­1 affects the strength of binding between enzyme and cofactor. Furthermore, the mutation of the corresponding residue (A24Y) in the m17-HSD enzyme affected considerably the dissociation constant (Kd) for NADPH. Indeed, the Kd value of the mutant is eightfold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 4), indicating that the strength of the interaction between loop B and loop 1­1 is higher. As explained above, this is likely the consequence of the increased number of interactions made between these loops in the presence of the tyrosine residue at position 24. Considering this, in addition to its role in the 17/17 stereospecificity of the m17-HSD and h3-HSD3, residue 24 is also clearly implicated in the interaction of these enzymes with the cofactor, since the nature of its side-chain influences the strength of the interaction made by the loop B in its closed conformation. This residue thus directly affects the binding and/or the release of NADPH.

Mouse 17-HSD/NADP +/epi-Testosterone Structure Crystallization and X-ray analysis of the recombinant m17-HSD, h3-HSD3(Y24A), and m17-HSD(K31A) mutant enzymes in ternary complex with NADPH and androstenedione Crystals were obtained by hanging-drop vapour diffusion at 4 °C. Preliminary crystallization attempts were performed as described.30 Crystals of m17-HSD were obtained in drops of a 2:1 (v/v) ratio of purified protein (10.8 mg/ml) and well solution (0.1 M Tris (pH 8), 18% (w/v) PEG-6000, 5% MPD, 1.2 mM 4). For the m17HSD(K31A) mutant enzyme, small crystals were obtained in similar conditions to wild-type enzyme but adjustments were generally needed to obtained crystals with dimensions suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments (well solution: 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.4), 24% PEG4000, 0.1 M LiSO4, 1.2 mM 4). For the h3-HSD3 (Y24A) mutant, crystals were obtained by mixing the same volume (1 l) of protein (14 mg/ml) and mother liquor solution containing 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 22% PEG-4000, and 1.8 mM 4. X-ray diffraction experiments were done at 100 K after crystals were soaked for 1­2 min in crystallization solution containing 20% ethylene glycol as cryoprotecting agent. Generally, 1 mM of 4 was also added to the cryoprotective solution in order to obtain a full occupancy of the steroid binding site. X-ray diffraction oscillation images were recorded in our laboratory (on an R-AXIS IIC image-plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode-generator equipped with focusing mirrors (Rigaku MSC)) or at the synchrotron (BM30-FIP beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France) ( = 0.933 Å) (see Results and Discussion). Data were integrated and scaled using the XDS program.32 The m17-HSD, m17-HSD(K31A), and h3-HSD3(Y24A) mutant enzyme structures were solved by the molecular replacement method with MOLREP software from CCP433 using coordinates of the m17-HSD binary complex (2HEJ)15 or type 3 human 3-HSD (1XJB)9 as a search model. The refinement procedure was performed using CNS34 and Refmac35 programs. The initial model issued from rigid body refinement was submitted to a cycle of simulated annealing at 3000 K followed by energy minimization cycles. Afterwards, electronic density maps calculations and manual rebuilding using O,36 NADPH and epi-T were added to the model. Models were refined by simple energy minimization followed by isotropic B-factors refinement (restrained, individual B-factor refinement) and corrected by manual rebuilding. Missing parts of the model, -mercaptoethanol, ethylene glycol, Tris, and water molecules were progressively added during the refinement procedure. Finally, the quality of the model was verified with PROCHECK.16 Site-directed mutagenesis pGEX-4t1-17-HSD A24Y mutation was performed using QuickChange Site-Directed Mutegenesis Kit (Stratagene) with 5-gtg-ctg-ggt-ttt-ggt-act-tat-ctt-cct-cta-cctcta-gag-tgt-ccc-aag-3 as forward primer (mutated nucleotides are bold and underlined). pGEX-4t1-3-HSD(Y24A) mutation was performed the same way with 5-gtc-ctggga-ttt-ggc-acc-gct-gcg-cct-gca-gag-gtt-cct-aaa-3. Positive clones were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and to ascertain that no other mutations had occurred.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant mouse 17-HSD expression and purification Recombinant enzymes (m17-HSD wild-type and mutant enzymes and h3-HSD3 mutant enzymes) were expressed and purified essentially as described.15,19,31 Briefly, for the wild-type m17-HSD enzyme, Escherichia coli cells, transformed with a plasmid containing the mouse 17-HSD cDNA in fusion with glutathione Stransferase (GST), were used to produce at a very high level a protein of about 55 kDa, a molecular mass that corresponds to that of the recombinant GST-m17-HSD fusion protein. This protein remained the major constituent of the soluble fraction obtained after a 30 min centrifugation at 100 000g. The soluble fraction was then directly applied on a glutathione-Sepharose column and about 12 mg of pure fusion protein were purified from 100 ml of bacterial culture. GST-m17-HSD fusion protein was cleaved by thrombin for two days at 4 °C and fragments were purified by anion-exchange chromatography. About 5 mg of highly purified m17-HSD were routinely obtained from 100 ml of bacterial culture. Purified recombinant mouse 17-HSD was finally concentrated to 14 mg/ml in a solution containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mM -mercaptoethanol and stored at 4 °C.

Mouse 17-HSD/NADP +/epi-Testosterone Structure Steady-state enzyme kinetics Determination of kinetic constants for androstenedione was performed as described, with minor modifications.30 Briefly, the reactions were performed at 37 °C with purified enzymes in a final volume of 100 l PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.3) containing 1 mM NADPH and 0.5 M of the indicated radiolabelled steroid for 30­60 min in the presence of substrates. After incubation, the steroids were extracted twice with 1 ml of ether. The organic phase was evaporated to dryness, then resuspended in 40 l of dichloromethane and applied on Silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (MERCK), before separation by two successive migrations in the dichloromethane: ethyl acetate (9:1, v/v) solvent system.37 Substrates and metabolites were identified by comparison with reference steroids, revealed by autoradiography. Epi-T was revealed with UV light (254 nm). Determination of binding constant for NADPH by fluorescence titration Fluorescence titration assays were made essentially as described.38 Briefly, binding constants (Kd) for NADPH of recombinant wild-type m17-HSD and h3-HSD3 enzymes and the m17-HSD(A24Y) and h3-HSD3(Y24A) mutants were determined by measurement of the protein fluorescence on a SLM 8000 fluorometer. Measurements were made at 22 °C in a 2 ml cell containing a magnetic stirrer, the purified enzyme (20 g/ml) and PBS buffer in a final volume of 1 ml. Protein fluorescence was measured following the incremental addition of NADPH (0­5 M). The total volume change from the addition of cofactor was less than 0.5%, and the corrections for change in NADPH concentrations were made. Excitation of samples was at 280 nm with fluorescence emission scanned from 300 to 500 nm at 120 nm/min. Emission and excitation bandpasses were both set to 4 nm. Data were plotted as the percentage change in fluorescence at emission max (%Fluorescence) versus NADPH concentration. Kd values were estimated by fitting these data to a saturation absorption isotherm using the GraphPad Prism program.
