ABSTRACT:

Environmental aromatic acids are transformed to chemical energy in bacteria that possess the requisite secondary pathways. Some of these pathways rely on the activation of the aromatic acid by coenzyme A (CoA) thioesterification catalyzed by an aromatic acid: CoA ligase. Adaptation of such pathways to the bioremediation of man-made pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) requires that the chlorinated benzoic acid byproduct that is formed be able to be eliminated by further degradation. To take advantage of natural benzoic acid degrading pathways requiring initial ring activation by thioesterification, the pathway aromatic acid:CoA ligase must be an effective catalyst with the chlorinated benzoic acid. This study, which focuses on the 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase (CBL) of the 4-monochlorobiphenyl degrading bacterium Alcaligenes sp. strain ALP83, was carried out to determine if the 4-chlorobenzoate binding site of this enzyme can be transformed by rational design to recognize the chlorobenzoic acids formed in the course of breakdown of other environmental PCB congeners. The fundamental question addressed in this study is whether it is possible to add or subtract space from the substrate-binding pocket of this ligase (to complement the topology of the unnatural aromatic substrate) without causing disruption of the ligase catalytic machinery. Herein, we report the results of a substrate specificity analysis that, when interpreted within the context of the X-ray crystal structures, set the stage for the rational design of the ligase for thioesterification of two PCB-derived chlorobenzoic acids. The ligase was first optimized to catalyze CoA thioesterification of 3,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, a poor substrate, by truncating Ile303, a large hydrophobic residue that packs against the ring meta-C(H) group. The structural basis for the 100-fold enhancement in the rate of 3,4-dichlorobenzoate thioesterification catalyzed by the I303A and I303G CBL mutants was validated by determination of the crystal structure of the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate-bound enzymes. Determinations of the structures of I303 mutant complexes of 3-chlorobenzoate, a very poor substrate, revealed nonproductive binding as a result of the inability of the substrate ring C(4)H group to fill the pocket that binds the C(4)Cl group of the native substrate. The C(4)Cl pocket of the CBL I303A mutant was then reduced in size by strategic amino acid replacement. A 54-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency was observed for the CBL F184W/I303A/V209T triple mutant. The results of this investigation are interpreted as evidence that the plasticity of the ligase catalytic scaffold is sufficient to allow expansion of substrate range by rational design. The combination of structural and kinetic analyses of the constructed mutants proved to be an effective approach to engineering the ligase for novel substrates.

have accumulated in the environment as a result of global dispersion (1-3). Research into methods applicable to the removal of PCB and DDT contaminants from the environment has been stimulated by the demonstration of their toxic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic properties (4-7). One effective strategy is "bioremediation", a process that employs the chemical pathways of naturally occurring bacteria, or bacteria that have been genetically engineered, for in vivo degradation (8-11). PCBs are chlorinated analogues of biphenyl. Biphenyl is oxidatively degraded by specialized soil-dwelling bacteria to benzoate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate (12-17). These two products are further oxidized to metabolites that are degraded by the citric acid cycle. PCB congeners that are

Wu et al. context of the structure of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding site. 3,4-Dichlorobenzoate and 3-chlorobenzoate were selected as substrates for the second phase of our work, which concentrated on the restructuring of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket by strategic amino acid replacement. The results reported below show that the substrate range of CBL is subject to extension through structure-guided protein engineering. The plasticity of the binding site, which tolerates these structural changes, is no doubt a key component of the natural evolution of the acyl adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily (to which CBL belongs) (22), allowing continual diversification within the family to reach novel organic acid metabolites. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. Except where mentioned, all chemicals and coupling enzymes [adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), and lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27)] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Custom-synthesized PCR primers were obtained from Invitrogen, as were the restriction enzymes, the pfu polymerase, and the T4 DNA ligase. Competent JM109 and BL21(DE3) cells were purchased from Stratagene, and the pQE-70 vector was purchased from QIAGEN. DNA sequencing analysis was carried out by the DNA Sequencing Facility of the University of New Mexico. SDS-PAGE was performed with gels prepared from a 12% acrylamide gel with a 3% stacking gel (37.5:1 acrylamide:biacryamide ratio) (Bio-Rad). CBL Preparation. A single colony of E. coli JM109 containing the plasmid SphI-BglII-pQE-70-CBAL (20, 21) was used to inoculate 10 mL of LB medium containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin at 37 °C with mixing at 250 rpm. The 10 mL culture was then used to inoculate 10 L of fresh LB medium containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin, and the culture was grown at 20 °C with mixing at 200 rpm. After 26 h (OD  0.7 at 600 nm), isopropyl -thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Following incubation at 20 °C and mixing at 200 rpm for 10 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 15 min. The 10 g pellet was suspended in 100 mL of lysis buffer [50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 10 mM imidazole, and 1 mM DTT] containing 10 µL of 0.1 mM protease inhibitor PMSF, passed through a French press at 1200 psi, and then centrifuged at 48000g and 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (QIAGEN, 25 mL), which had been pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The column was washed with 500 mL of wash buffer [50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 50 mM imidazole, and 1 mM DTT] and then eluted with 200 mL of elution buffer [50 mM NaH2PO4, 250 mM imidazole, and 1 mM DTT (pH 8.0)]. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then selectively pooled and dialyzed for 3 h against three changes of 1.5 L of 50 mM K+Hepes buffer containing 1 mM DTT (pH 7.5 and 25 °C). The protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis. The protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford method (36) and by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm ( ) 27 760 M-1 cm-1). The yield was 6 mg/g of wet cells. CBL ActiVity Assays. (1) Direct Continuous Assay. The CBL reaction with 4-chlorobenzoate was assessed at 25 °C by measuring the increase in the absorbance of the 1 mL

chlorinated at only one of the two aromatic rings are converted to 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate and chlorinated benzoate (10). If not degraded, the chlorinated benzoate byproduct accumulates and inhibits bacterial growth (10). Thus, to be effective at the bioremediation of a PCB, the bacterium must couple the biphenyl pathway with a chlorobenzoate-degrading pathway. Such a strategy has been observed to operate in the natural 4-monochlorobiphenyl degrader Alcaligenes sp. strain ALP83 (18, 19). This strain was isolated from PCB-contaminated soil and shown to degrade 4-monochlorobiphenyl to carbon dioxide by using the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenation pathway in combination with the biphenyl oxidation pathway (Scheme 1) (20, 21). The conversion of the 4-chlorobenzoate to the metabolite 4-hydroxybenzoate transforms the growth inhibitor to an additional source of chemical energy. The 4-chlorobenzoate is activated for hydrolytic dehalogenation by conversion to the corresponding CoA thioester (22). CoA thioesterification of the aromatic carboxylate group is a strategy used in other bacterial secondary pathways that degrade aromatic rings to metabolites, as exemplified by the phenylacetate (23), benzoate (24), and reductive 4-hydroxybenzoate (25) catabolic pathways. These pathways serve as valuable starting points for the engineering of novel pathways for use in bioremediation of man-made aromatic pollutants. The mono-, di-, and trichlorinated benzoates generated from microbial degradation of asymmetric PCBs, for example, might be mineralized by using designer pathways that employ engineered enzymes. The aromatic acid:CoA ligase catalyzes the first step of the pathway, and therefore, it is the logical starting point for engineering the pathway enzymes for degradation of a novel substrate. The bacterial ligases that catalyze the transformation of the aromatic acid to the corresponding CoA thioester are not well-characterized in part because of their instability and/or poor expression of their encoding gene in Escherichia coli.2 The 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase (CBL), however, is an exception (26). The recently reported X-ray structure of Alcaligenes sp. strain ALP83 CBL complexed with 4-chlorobenzoate (27) opened the door to the expansion of substrate range by rational design of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding site. Rational design alone, or in combination with saturation mutagenesis, has been successfully used in the modification of enzyme specificity (for recent examples, see refs 2835). The first phase of the work, reported herein, focused on the analysis of the substrate specificity of CBL within the
2 There are few reports in the literature of the characterization of purified aromatic acid ligases in general and recombinant aromatic ligases in particular. In our hands, the yield of recombinant 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase derived from 4-chlorobenzoate-degrading Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter strains using E. coli clones as the overexpression system is low and the activity of the purified ligase is unstable. We have met with limited or no success in the isolation of active recombinant bacterial phenylacetate:CoA ligase, benzoate:CoA ligase, or aminobenzoate:CoA ligase. The reason(s) for this undesirable behavior is not clear.

4-Chlorobenzoate: CoA Ligase Redesign reaction solution at 300 nm ( ) 2.5 mM-1 cm-1). The 1 mL assay solution contained 2 mM 4-chlorobenzoate, 1 mM CoA, 3.5 mM ATP, and 15 mM MgCl2 in 50 mM K+Hepes (pH 7.5). (2) Coupled Assay. The CBL reactions with the various carboxylate substrates were monitored by using the coupled assay that detects the formation of AMP through the sequential activities of adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The 1 mL solutions initially contained 1 mM CoA, 3.5 mM ATP, 15 mM MgCl2, 200 µM NADH, 3 mM PEP, 5 mM KCl, 11 units of adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3), 9 units of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), and 9 units of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) in 50 mM K+Hepes (pH 7.5 and 25 °C). The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of two molecules of NADH per molecule of AMP formed was monitored. Determination of Steady-State Kinetic Constants. The initial velocity for CBL-catalyzed reactions was measured as a function of one substrate concentration (varied between 0.5- and 5-fold KM) with the two cosubstrates at a fixed, saturating concentration (1 mM CoA, 3.5 mM ATP, and 2 mM 4-chlorobenzoate). The concentration of MgCl2 used for each reaction solution is 11.5 mM plus the millimolar concentration of the ATP present. Reaction solutions were buffered with 50 mM K+Hepes (pH 7.5 and 25 °C). The Vmax and KM values were calculated from the initial velocity data using eq 1 and KinetAsyst. The kcat was calculated from the ratio of Vmax and enzyme concentration.

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 50, 2007 14489 cryoprotectant solution contained 24% ethylene glycol, 24% pentaerythritol propoxylate 426, and 50 mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (pH 6.75). Additionally, all cryoprotectant solutions contained 1 mM ATP and 3-chlorobenzoate or 3,4-dichlorobenzoate. Data were collected for crystals of the Ile303 CBAL mutants at beamline F2 of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. Data collection was performed with an ADSC Quantum-210 detector set at a crystal-detector distance of 240 mm using X-rays at a wavelength of 0.97930 Å. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with HKL2000 (38). Despite the difference in the solution pH prevailing under the crystallization conditions, the crystals were isomorphous to the wild-type crystals used previously (27); however, the unit cells were longer by 2.5%. Because of this increase in the lengths of cell axes, the structures were determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP (39). The search model used was the SeMet-containing structure (PDB entry 1T5H). To generate the search model, the SeMet residues were replaced with methionines, the water molecules and metal ions were removed, and the Ile303 was replaced with the alanine or glycine side chain. In all cases, the solution was the top peak of the rotation and translation searches. The molecular replacement solution was subjected to a round of refinement with REFMAC5 (40) followed by continued cycles of manual model building with COOT (41) and maximum likelihood refinement. Weighted individual B-factors were applied for all models. Near completion of the modeling, TLS refinement (42) was used to apply grouped anisotropic thermal parameters to the N- and C-terminal domains, which resulted in a drop in Rfree. Electron densities for the 3-chlorobenzoate and 3,4-dichlorobenzoate ligands were clear, and their atoms were added after several rounds of model building and refinement. Given the limited resolution, water molecules were conservatively added to spherical, or nearly spherical, density that was present in the difference maps at >2.5. Although ATP had been included in the crystallization media, no density for the nucleotide was apparent in any of the structures. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for all four structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank: 2QVZ for I303A bound to 3-CB, 2QWO for I303A bound to 3,4-DCB, 2QVX for I303G bound to 3-CB, and 2QVY for I303G bound to 3,4-DCB. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structural Basis for Recognition of the CBL-4-Chlorobenzoate Complex. The 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket residues Phe184, His207, Phe249, Ala280, Ile303, Gly305, Met310, and Asn311 (Figure 1) are conserved among the six additional known CBL sequences from Comamonas, Pseudomonas, and Arthrobacter species (divergence to 62% nonidentity between sequence pairs). Binding pocket residues Val208 (Thr in Pseudomonas CBL) and Val209 (Ile in Arthrobacter CBL), on the other hand, are not stringently conserved. The 4-chlorobenzoate aromatic ring and its C(4) chloro substituent are surrounded by the side chains of the nonpolar pocket residues, and by the methylene group of the Asn311 side chain. The structure of unliganded CBL (determined previously at 2.0 Å resolution) shows three solvent molecules present in the 4-chlorobenzoate binding

The CBL mutant genes were prepared by using a PCR-based method that employed Alcaligenes sp. strain ALP83 (NCBI accession number AF 537222.1) derived SphI-BglII-pQE-70-CBAL subclone (20, 21) as the template, and commercial primers. The purified PCR product was digested with SphI and BglII (Invitrogen) and ligated to the SphI- and BglII-digested plasmid pQE-70 [which includes the six-His tag and stop codon (QIAGEN)] with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The mutant gene sequence was verified by DNA sequencing which was carried out by the Center for Genetics in Medicine, University of New Mexico. The mutant proteins were prepared using the same procedure that was used in the preparation of recombinant wild-type CBL (see above). The homogeneity of each purified mutant CBL was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis. Crystallization and Determination of Structures of CBL Ile303 Mutants. The Ile303 CBL mutant proteins were crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion using a precipitant consisting 14-22% pentaerythritol propoxylate 426 (37) and 50 mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (pH 6.5-6.75). The alanine and glycine mutants were each cocrystallized in the presence of ATP and either 3-chlorobenzoate or 3,4-dichlorobenzoate. Crystals were grown at 4 °C and appeared within 1-2 days. Crystals were cryoprotected by being transferred sequentially to solutions containing 4-24% ethylene glycol, then mounted in a nylon cryoloop, and cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The final

Wu et al. encoding gene within the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenation pathway operon (20, 22), we know to be 4-chlorobenzoate. CBL is thus functionally distinct from the acyl-CoA synthetases of primary metabolism and the phenylacetate:CoA ligase of the phenylacetate catabolic pathway. The determination of the substrate specificity toward ringsubstituted benzoates defines the spatial and electrostatic requirements for the active site and sets the stage for the engineering of this enzyme to accept alternate benzoate substrates. Comparison of the substrate activities of the various para-substituted (C4), ortho-substituted (C2 or C6), and meta-substituted (C3 or C5) benzoates reveals that CBL catalyzes the thioesterification of a wide range of parasubstituted benzoates with varying degrees of efficiency and that CBL displays very low activity with the ortho- and metasubstituted benzoates (Table 1). These observations can be rationalized within the context of the structure of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding site (Figure 1). Specifically, the C(4)Cl group of the bound 4-chlorobenzoate is accommodated by a small hydrophobic binding pocket [hereafter termed the "C(4)X pocket"] formed by C and C of the Met310 side chain, C of the Asn311 side chain, and the aromatic ring of Phe184. Substrate discrimination of parasubstituted benzoates is therefore based on the compatibility of the size, shape, and polarity of the benzoate C(4) substituent with the C(4)X pocket. Notably, benzoate itself is a poor substrate. We assume that because of its small size, the hydrogen atom at C(4) does not fill the C(4)X pocket, and consequently, ligand binding affinity and orientation are adversely affected. The majority of the para-substituted benzoates that were tested, however, proved to be efficient CBL substrates (kcat/KM > 104 s-1 M-1). Among these are the para-halosubstituted benzoates 4-fluorobenzoate, 4-bromobenzoate, and 4-iodobenzoate. Remarkably, the electron induction provided by the C(4)F group does not appear to strongly impair the reactivity of the ring carboxylate, nor does the desolvation of the C(4)F group into the hydrophobic pocket prevent binding. Indeed, the kcat/KM of 4-fluorobenzoate, although 50-fold smaller than the kcat/KM measured for 4-chlorobenzoate, is 10-folder greater than the kcat/KM measured for benzoate. CBL also shows significant activity with 4-nitrobenzoate, 4-methylbenzoate, 4-ethylbenzoate, 4-methoxybenzoate, 4-cyanobenzoate, and 4-trifluoromethylbenzoate. In contrast, the kcat/KM of 4-hydroxybenzoate is 10000-fold smaller than that of 4-chlorobenzoate. This reduction may be attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding properties of the C(4)OH group. Specifically, the loss of the three H-bonds between the C(4)OH group and water that will occur upon complex formation is likely to reduce the binding affinity. Moreover, despite the comparatively high nucleophilicity of the 4-hydroxybenzoate carboxylate (because of donation of electrons from the ring hydroxyl group), the kcat is also diminished. Because 4-hydroxybenzoate is the end product of the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenation pathway (Scheme 1) (22), it is essential that CBL discriminate between it and 4-chlorobenzoate. Clearly, the evolution of CBL has optimized its reactivity with 4-chlorobenzoate while minimizing its reactivity with 4-hydroxybenzoate. Examination of the steady-state kinetic constants for the ortho- and meta-substituted benzoate substrates reveals that

FIGURE 1: Representation of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket in CBL from Alcaligenes sp. strain ALP83. This figure was generated from the X-ray coordinates of wild-type CBL in complex with 4-chlorobenzoate (PDB entry 1T5D) (27) using Pymol (52). The 4-chlorobenzoate ligand is shown with yellow carbon atoms, red oxygen atoms, and a green chlorine atom.

pocket (27). When the ligand binds, the solvent water molecules are displaced. The short distance (4 Å on average) separating the 4-chlorobenzoate ring carbon atoms and the binding pocket residues allows for van der Waals interaction. The ring carboxylate projects outside the entrance of the hydrophobic binding pocket and is positioned 3.7 Å from the His207 imidazole N (Figure 1). This distance is outside of the distance for strong hydrogen bond formation. Thus, unless the distance is decreased by a change in conformation induced by MgATP binding, it may be assumed that the orientation of the ring carboxylate is dictated by the confinement of the aromatic ring within the hydrophobic binding pocket. As this work progressed, we discovered that the hydrophobic binding pocket does in fact play an essential role in productive binding (see the discussion of the 3-chlorobenzoate-CBL I303A and I303G complexes). On the basis of the structure of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding site, we anticipated a narrow substrate range. To define this range, the steady-state kinetic constants for CBLcatalyzed thioesterification of a series of organic acids were measured, with particular emphasis placed on ring-substituted benzoates. The two cosubstrates ATP and CoA, and the cofactor Mg2+, were present in the reaction solutions at saturating concentrations (see Table 1). Under these conditions, the 4-chlorobenzoate kcat ) 9.2 s-1, KM ) 0.93 µM, and kcat/KM ) 9.9 × 106 M-1 s-1. With phenylacetate serving as the substrate, the kcat value is reduced 3 orders of magnitude and the kcat/KM value is reduced 6 orders of magnitude (Table 1). The methylene group increases the distance between the aromatic ring and the carboxylate group, which in turn reduces substrate binding affinity and hinders the orientation of the substrate for reaction with the ATP. The kcat measured for hexanoate thioesterification is 5-fold lower than that measured for 4-chlorobenzoate thioesterification, and the hexanoate kcat/KM is 1 × 104-fold lower. These results suggest that the CBL active site can accommodate the flexible, hydrophobic hexanoyl unit, however at a substantial cost to binding affinity and turnover rate. On the basis of these results, we conclude that CBL has evolved to target a benzoate substrate, which from the location of its

KM is dramatically increased3 and kcat is dramatically decreased. The meta-substituted benzoates 3-chlorobenzoate, 3-bromobenzoate, 3-hydroxybenzoate, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methoxybenzoate are especially poor substrates as are the ortho-substituted benzoates 2-bromobenzoate and 2-methylbenzoate. The 2-chlorobenzoate shows a modest level of activity: kcat/KM ) 2 × 104 M-1 s-1 which is 500-fold lower than the 4-chlorobenzoate kcat/KM value. Given that the differences in size and electronic properties of Cl versus Br are small, it is curious that the kcat/KM value measured for the 2-bromobenzoate is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the 4-chlorobenzoate kcat/KM value. 2-Cyano-, 2-iodo-, 3-cyano-, 3-nitro-, 3-iodo-, 2-methoxy-, 2,5-dichloro-, 2,6dichloro-, and 2,3,5-trichlorobenzoate are not substrates for CBL. Notably, the first target for the engineering, 3,4-dichlorobenzoate, displays a modest level of activity (kcat/KM ) 2 × 103 M-1 s-1). The second target, 3-chlorobenzoate, is much less active (kcat/KM ) 1.7 × 102 M-1 s-1). Overall, the kinetic results indicate that the CBL 4-chlorobenzoate binding site fails to accommodate the ortho- and meta-substituted benzoates in an optimal orientation for reaction. Inspection of the CBL structure shown in Figure 1 reveals limited space
3 Throughout this paper, changes in the KM are related to changes in substrate binding affinity. It is well known that only in cases where rapid-equilibrium binding prevails is the KM equivalent to the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex. Thus, in this context, we use the change in KM as an indicator and not as a quantitative measure of the change in binding affinity.

(4 Å) between benzoate ring atom C(2), C(3), C(5), or C(6) and the walls of the active site. Thus, whereas CBL productively binds a wide range of benzoates substituted at the para position with small hydrophobic substituents, it discriminates against the corresponding ortho- and metasubstituted benzoates via size exclusion. The meta-substituted benzoates are especially challenging substrates. Below, we describe the rational redesign of the CBL 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket for enhanced activity with 3,4-dichlorobenzoate and 3-chlorobenzoate. Both of these chlorinated benzoates are dead-end byproducts of microbial PCB degradation (10). The rational engineering of CBL for thioesterification of 3,4-dichlorobenzoate and 3-chlorobenzoate was carried out to determine whether the 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket is suitable for redesign to extend substrate range, and to produce novel enzyme catalysts for expanded PCB bioremediation. Redesign of the CBL 4-Chlorobenzoate Binding Site for Accommodation of a Meta-Chloro Ring Substituent. The CBL substrate specificity profile reported in the previous section shows that the C(4)Cl group makes an important contribution to productive binding. For this reason, 3,4dichlorobenzoate rather than 3-chlorobenzoate was selected as our first target for CBL engineering. The 3,4-dichlorobenzoate kcat/KM value of 2 × 103 M-1 s-1 is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the kcat/KM value of 4-chlorobenzoate. We can attribute this effect to the meta-Cl substituent and specifically to the unfavorable steric effects that may be imposed by this substituent. As indicated in Figure 1, C1

Wu et al. s-1; I303V CBL, 2.5 × 104 M-1 s-1 (3.7-fold decrease from the wild-type value); I303A CBL, 3.6 × 104 M-1 s-1 (2.6fold decrease from the wild-type value); and I303G CBL 2.2 × 105 M-1 s-1 (2.4-fold increase from the wild-type value) (Table S1 of the Supporting Information). The kcat/ KM measured for CoA did not vary significantly: wild-type CBL, 3.0 × 104 M-1 s-1; I303V CBL, 5.1 × 104 M-1 s-1 (1.7-fold increase from the wild-type value); I303A CBL, 2.1 × 104 M-1 s-1 (1.4-fold decrease from the wild-type value); and I303G CBL, 1.6 × 104 M-1 s-1 (2-fold decrease from the wild-type value). These results show that structural alteration of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket has the greatest impact on the binding and reaction of the carboxylate substrate (vs the binding and activation of ATP and CoA), as one might expect on the basis of the separation of substrate binding sites observed in the CBL structure. Whereas the binding site of wild-type CBL is expected to be most compatible with 4-chlorobenzoate, the binding sites of the I303V, I303A, and I303G CBL mutants are expected to be most compatible with 3,4-dichlorobenzoate provided that the meta-C(Cl) group fills the space vacated by the Ile303 substitution. As reported in Table 2, the kcat/KM measured with wild-type CBL and 3,4-dichlorobenzoate is 2.0 × 103 M-1 s-1 and the kcat/KM value measured for I303V CBL is 2.5 × 104 M-1 s-1 (12.5-fold increase from the wildtype value), for I303A CBL 1.6 × 105 M-1 s-1 (80-fold increase from the wild-type value), and for I303G CBL 1.4 × 105 M-1 s-1 (70-fold increase from the wild-type value). In contrast, the kcat decreased, but only to a comparatively small degree, with decreasing side chain size (wild-type CBL, 0.93 s-1; I303V CBL, 1.8-fold smaller; I303A CBL, 3.4fold smaller; and I303G CBL, 7.2-fold smaller). The observation that the kcat values measured with the 4-chlorobenzoate substrate and the mutant CBLs are similarly diminished (wild-type CBL, 9.2 s-1; I303V CBL, 3.0-fold smaller; I303A CBL, 6.0-fold smaller; and I303G CBL, 4.6fold smaller) is indicative of a small perturbation that is not substrate specific. It is noteworthy that the increase in the kcat/KM toward the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate substrate caused by the Ile303 substitution is not based on the increase in kcat but rather on the large decrease in the KM (wild-type CBL, 460 µM; I303V CBL, 23-fold smaller; I303A CBL, 256-fold smaller; and I303G CBL, 495-fold smaller) (Table 2). 3-Bromobenzoate, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-hydroxybenzoate also displayed increased kcat/KM values (10-fold) with the I303A CBL versus wild-type CBAL as a result of a decreased KM (Table S2 of the Supporting Information). For 3-methoxybenzoate, the increase was only 2-fold. 3-Cyanobenzoate, which did not exhibit detectable substrate activity with wild-type CBL, was discovered to have a kcat/KM of 1.1 × 102 M-1 s-1 (Table S2 of the Supporting Information). We found that the replacement of Ile303 with Tyr or Trp greatly diminishes the catalytic efficiency of 4-chlorobenzoate thioesterification and prevents the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate thioesterification (Table 2). Whereas the KM for 4-chlorobenzoate was increased 10000-fold, the KM values of ATP and CoA were increased by only 2-10-fold (Table S1 of the Supporting Information). Thus, the impact of spatial requirements of the substituted aromatic residues is restricted to 4-chlorobenzoate binding and does not extend to the other substrate binding sites.

of the Ile303 side chain and C and C of the Met310 side chain come within close range (4 Å) of the benzoate ring meta carbons. The larger space required for accommodation of meta-C(Cl) (1.8 Å C-Cl bond vs 1.1 Å C-H bond) will create steric crowding for both orientations of the bound 3,4dichlorobenzoate ligand. If additional space can be created by replacement of Ile303 or Met310 with an amino acid having a smaller hydrophobic side chain without disruption of the environment of the reaction center, the catalytic efficiency of CBL toward the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate might be enhanced. CBL catalysis proceeds via a two-step reaction (Scheme 2) (43). The first step involves the nucleophilic displacement of MgPPi from MgATP by the 4-chlorobenzoate carboxylate to form the 4-chlorobenzoyl adenylate, and the second step involves nucleophilic displacement of AMP from the 4-chlorobenzoyl adenylate by the thiol of CoA to form the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA product. The "centers" of these two reactions are thus located outside of the hydrophobic 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket shown in Figure 1. Therefore, the replacement of Ile303 or Met310 with a small hydrophobic residue should not impair catalysis unless it destabilizes the catalytic scaffold. Ultimately, we chose Ile303 for amino acid replacement because structure-based sequence alignments with other members of the acyl adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily showed that an amino acid as small as Gly is used at this position in some members [for example, the coumarate-CoA ligase from Arabidopsis thaliana (44), the FadD fatty acyl-CoA synthetase from E. coli (45), and the long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase of Thermus thermophilus HB8 (46)]. Thus, if the CBL Ile303 residue is replaced with Ala or Gly, it is likely that the stability of the protein, and the arrangement of catalytic residues within the active site, might not be affected. We replaced Ile303 with progressively smaller residues to evaluate the activities of the mutant CBLs toward catalysis of 3,4-dichlorobenzoate CoA thioesterification. The steady-state kinetic constants of the purified mutants I303V CBL, I303A CBL, and I303G CBL were first measured using 4-chlorobenzoate as a substrate so that we could determine the impact of the mutation on the catalytic efficiency with the native substrate (Table 2; the kcat, KM and kcat/KM values measured for ATP and CoA are reported in Table S1 of the Supporting Information). Notably, the 4-chlorobenzoate kcat/KM decreases with a decrease in the size of the side chain at position 303 in the mutants: I303V CBL, 2.2 × 106 M-1 s-1 (4.5-fold decrease from the wildtype value); I303A CBL, 6.0 × 105 M-1 s-1 (16.5-fold decrease from the wild-type value); and I303G CBL, 3.0 × 105 M-1 s-1 (33-fold decrease from the wild-type value). The decrease in the value of the respective mutants is derived from both a decrease in kcat and an increase in the value of KM. The kcat/KM measured for ATP varied but to a smaller degree and not in a trend: wild-type CBL, 9.3 × 104 M-1

We conclude that the hydrophobic CBL 4-chlorobenzoate binding site directs substrate specificity by size exclusion. Moreover, the working hypothesis is that the decrease observed in the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate KM with the I303V, I303A, and I303G CBL mutants is the direct result of providing a "space" for the meta-C(Cl) group. Determination of the Structure of I303A and I303G CBL Complexed with 3,4-Dichlorobenzoate. The X-ray crystal structures of the I303A and I303G CBL mutants complexed with 3,4-dichlorobenzoate were determined to test our hypothesis. The crystallographic and refinement statistics are presented in Table 3. The electron density maps of the ligand binding sites are shown in Figure 2, and the superposition of the mutant structures with the wild-type CBL-4-chlorobenzoate complex (PDB entry 1T5D) is shown in Figure 3. The structural overlay demonstrates that the mutant proteins adopt a conformation very similar to that of the wildtype CBL enzyme. In particular, the C-terminal domain,

which has been observed in multiple orientations for different members of the adenylate-forming family, assumes the same conformation as that of the wild-type enzyme. The rms deviation for CR atoms is 0.7 Å for all atoms of the N-terminal domain and 1.0 Å for the full-length structures. The C-terminal Ser504 is missing from the structures, which was also found with the wild-type CBAL in complex with 4-chlorobenzoate. In addition, the Gly- and Ser/Thr-rich loop near the active site is disordered. This disorder was also observed in the wild-type CBL structures as well as in the structures of several other members of this enzyme superfamily. A second surface loop (residues 109-112) is also poorly ordered. The superposition of the residues of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket of the wild-type CBL-4-chlorobenzoate complex and the residues of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket of the I303A CBL(3,4-dichlorobenzoate) complex is shown in stereo in Figure 4A.

The electron density maps were calculated with coefficients of the form Fo - Fc determined prior to inclusion of the ligand in the refinement. The maps are contoured at 2.5. Side chains of neighboring residues are labeled. The mutant residues are colored red. The red sphere in panels A and B represents the CR position of the CBL Gly303 mutant residue.

the structural resolution (2.2 and 2.6 Å, respectively), the positioning of the binding site residues and the benzoate ligand carboxylate group appears to be unchanged in the mutant complex. Thus, the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate is bound in the correct orientation for reaction in the I303A CBL active site. We also observed that the C(4)Cl group of the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate bound to the I303G CBL mutant fills the C(4)X pocket (see Figure S1A of the Supporting Information). The distance from the C(3)Cl group to the C atom of Ala in the mutant is 3.4 Å. By modeling the 3,4dichlorobenzoate to fit within the 4-chlorobenzoate binding site of wild-type CBL, and displaying a van der Waals surface on the ligand, we found that a potential steric overlap between the wild-type Ile303 side chain and the C(3)Cl group exists. The distance from the C(3)Cl group to the C1 or C1 atom of Ile303 is only 2.3 Å. The orientation of 3,4-dichlorobenzoate is such that the C(5)H group is directed at Met310 and the C(3)Cl group is directed at Ala303 (or the Gly of I303G). This orientation is true to the design. To most easily visualize the actual changes in the topology of the binding site that accommodate the ligand in this orientation, VOIDOO (47) was used to create a solvent cage (hereafter termed the "ligand cage") that depicts the three-dimensional space available to the ligand. Figure 5A illustrates the accessible ligand cage of the wild-type enzyme. Into this cage we "add back" the 3,4dichlorobenzoate ligand as it is defined by the I303A CBL(3,4-dichlorobenzoate) complex structure. The C(3)Cl group extends outside this cage, consistent with the modest catalytic efficiency of the enzyme toward 3,4-dichlorobenzoate (re-

ported in Table 1). Panels B and C of Figure 5 show the ligand cages of the I303A and I303G CBL mutants generated from the X-ray structures of the I303A and I303G CBL complexes of 3,4-dichlorobenzoate. It is evident from these figures that the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate C(3)Cl group is accommodated within the "extra" space provided by the truncation of I303. This finding validates the strategy used for the rational redesign of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket for expanded substrate range. The structures show that the needed space was created in the I303 mutants, allowing the enzyme to act on a novel substrate, without a reduction in protein stability or significant impairment of the functioning of the catalytic scaffold. Having achieved this objective, we next sought to engineer the 4-chlorobenzoate binding site so that the requirement for a C(4)Cl group to fill the C(4)X pocket could be eliminated. This work is described in the following section. ActiVity Analysis and Determination of the Structure of 3-Dichlorobenzoate Complexes of I303A and I303G CBL Mutants. The low substrate activity observed with benzoate is a clear indication that the C(4)Cl group of the native substrate 4-chlorobenzoate is needed for efficient binding and turnover. On the basis of the X-ray structure of the wildtype CBL-4-chlorobenzoate complex (Figure 1), we surmised that the C(4)Cl group locks the ring in place by filling the C(4)X hydrophobic pocket. 3-Chlorobenzoate has too much steric bulk at C(3) and too little steric bulk at C(4). Indeed, the kcat/KM value measured with 3-chlorobenzoate and wild-type CBL is quite low, 1.7 × 102 M-1 s-1 [10000-

fold lower than that of 4-chlorobenzoate and 10-fold lower than that of 3,4-dichlorobenzoate (Table 1)]. While the Ala and Gly replacements of I303 increased the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate kcat/KM value 100-fold, the 3-chlorobenzoate kcat/KM value is increased only 10-fold. The following 3-chlorobenzoate kcat/KM values were measured for the four mutants: I303V CBL, 5.1 × 102 M-1 s-1 (3-fold increase from the wild-type value); I303A CBL, 1.5 × 103 M-1 s-1 (8.8-fold increase from the wild-type value); and I303G CBL, 7.2 × 102 M-1 s-1 (4.2-fold increase from the wild-type value). The decrease observed in KM for 3-chlorobenzoate (wild-type CBL, 800 µM; I303V CBL, 14-fold smaller; I303A CBL, 64-fold smaller; and I303G CBL, 88-fold smaller) is partially offset by the decrease in kcat (wild-type CBL, 0.136 s-1; I303V CBL, 4.7-fold smaller; I303A CBL, 7.2-fold smaller; and I303G CBL, 21-fold smaller). The decreased 3-chlorobenzoate KM values suggest that increased binding affinity occurs with a decrease in the size of the I303 side chain, consistent with the results obtained with 3,4-dichlorobenzoate. However, the absence of the C(4)Cl group to fill the C(4)X pocket may lead to nonproductive binding of the 3-chlorobenzoate. To test this hypothesis, the X-ray structures of the I303A and I303G CBL mutants complexed with 3-chlorobenzoate were determined. The electron density maps are shown in Figure 2, and the crystallographic and refinement statistics are presented in Table 3. The only significant difference between these structures and those reported in the previous section for the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate complexes of I303A and I303G CBL is the position of the ligand within the 4-chlorobenzoate

binding pocket. Figure 4B shows the superposition of the wild-type enzyme and the I303A mutant bound to 3-chlorobenzoate. A superposition of the wild-type enzyme with the I303G mutant is shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. It is evident from these structures that the 3-chlorobenzoate ligand is positioned too deep within the 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket. We concluded that this is because the C(4)H group is not able to adequately fill the C(4)X pocket which is needed to lock the ring in a productive binding orientation. In both mutants, the 3-chlorobenzoate carboxylate group is positioned 0.7 Å below the position of the carboxylate group of the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate or the 4-chlorobenzoate carboxylate group observed in the wildtype CBL(4-chlorobenzoate) complex. Design of CBL Variants with ImproVed 3-Chlorobenzoate ConVersion Rates. To increase CBL activity with 3-chlorobenzoate, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis, replacing the residues that form the C(4)X binding pocket with larger amino acids. Residues Phe184, Asn311, and Met310 were identified as the nearest neighbors to the substrate C(4)Cl group (Figure 1). The I303A CBL mutant was used as the starting point for the C(4)X pocket engineering. Phe184, Asn311, and Met310 were separately replaced with amino acids having slightly greater steric bulk (see the list of mutants tested in Table 4). The use of "natural" amino acids placed a severe limitation on the remodeling. Nevertheless, in silico models generated for the planned mutants suggested that a small yet possibly significant decrease in the size of the C(4)X pocket might be achieved. At this stage, we are

most interested in proof of concept. In particular, the issue to be addressed is whether the plasticity of the site is sufficient to adapt to the steric and electrostatic perturbations introduced by the restructuring of the C(4)X pocket. For the 3-chlorobenzoate thioesterification catalyzed by F184W/I303A CBL, the kcat/KM ) 5.4 × 103 M-1 s-1 (Table 4). This represents a 32-fold increase in efficiency relative to that of wild-type CBL and a 4-fold increase relative to that of the I303A CBL mutant. In contrast, the kcat/KM ) 2.3 × 102 M-1 s-1 measured with 3-chlorobenzoate and F184Y/I303A CBL is 6.5-fold smaller than that measured for I303A CBL. The KM values measured for ATP and CoA (Table S4 of the Supporting Information) for these two mutants (and the mutants described below) are not significantly different from those measured with wild-type CBL. Thus, the impact of the amino acid substitutions appears to be limited to the 4-chlorobenzoate binding site. Next, CBL M310 and N311 mutants were examined. Unfortunately, only the N311Q/I303A mutant exhibited enhanced enzyme catalytic activity relative to the I303A single mutation (Table 4). The kcat/KM measured with 3-chlorobenzoate and N311Q/I303A CBAL is 3.6 × 103 M-1 s-1 which corresponds to a 2.4-fold increase from that of I303A. This is largely a KM effect. The kcat/KM values measured for N311H/I303A and N311T/I303A are smaller than that of I303A (19- and 2-fold, respectively). Although the kcat values of these two N311 double mutants are increased over that of I303A CBL (1.4-fold increase with N311H/I303A and 12-fold increase with N311T/I303A), the

increased KM values (27- and 25-fold, respectively) counter the kcat effect. Last, the triple mutant F184W/N311Q/I303A was prepared to determine whether these three site mutations would have an additive effect on catalytic efficiency. The triple mutant is more active than the double mutant N311Q/ I303A but not as active as the double mutant F184W/I303A. The CBL mutants V209Y/I303A and V209W/I303A are not active with 3-chlorobenzoate (Table 4). In contrast, V209T/I303A CBL displayed a kcat of 0.071 s-1, 3.8-fold larger than the kcat of I303A. However, the KM is also increased. The CBL triple mutant F184W/I303A/V209T on the other hand exhibited a kcat/KM of 9.1 × 103 M-1 s-1 with 3-chlorobenzoate. This represents a 54-fold increase over the kcat/KM of wild-type CBL. The F184W/I303A/N311Q mutant displayed a kcat/KM of 4.0 × 103 M-1 s-1 with 3-chlorobenzoate (27-fold increase over the wild-type value). The F184W/I303A/V209T CBL mutant is the most active mutant with 3-chlorobenzoate serving as the substrate. However, compared to I303A CBL which was used as the starting point for engineering the C(4)Cl pocket, F184W/ I303A/V209T CBL is only 6-fold more active. Thus, the replacement of the pocket residues with residues achieved the desired affect, but overall, the observed rate enhancement is modest. This suggests that the positions of the main chain segments that frame the C(4)Cl pocket should be targeted for engineering a closed pocket. In future work, this alternative will be explored. Summary and Conclusion. These studies show that the 4-chlorobenzoate binding site has evolved to function within the 4-chlorobenzoate pathway (Scheme 1). The high kcat/KM for 4-chlorobenzoate contrasted with the low kcat/KM for the pathway product 4-hydroxybenzoate, evidence an effective mechanism for substrate discrimination. The substrate specificity profile analyzed in the context of the CBL(4-chlorobenzoate) structure suggested that the substrate binding affinity and the orientation of the substrate carboxylate group for reaction are controlled by two distinct properties of the binding pocket. One property is hydrophobicity, and the other is "lock-in-key" topological complementation. The addition of nonpolar ring substituents at the ortho or meta positions of the substrate is not well-tolerated because of the steric hindrance that taxes binding affinity. The substitution of the para-C(Cl) group with substituents similar in size and

hydrophobicity is well-tolerated because these substituents are able to fill the para-C(Cl) subpocket at the bottom of the binding site and by doing so lock the ring in the correct position for alignment of the carboxylate group for attack at the R-P atom of the bound ATP (Scheme 2). In contrast, benzoates that do not possess a C(4) substituent of adequate size will "sink" into the pocket and the ring carboxylate will be poorly oriented for reaction. The replacement of the 4-chlorobenzoate binding pocket residue Ile303 with Ala created adequate space for the accommodation of the C(3)Cl group (meta) of the 3,4-dichlorobenzoate and increased the kcat/KM from 2.0 × 103 to 1.6 × 105 M-1 s-1. The attempted reconstruction of the CBL C(4)Cl subpocket to prop the 3-chlorobenzoate within the binding site of the I303A CBL mutant was only modestly successful because of the limitation of the structural changes that could be made at this site using natural amino acids. It is likely that substitutions made at the second sphere of binding site residues via focused random mutagenesis (30, 34) could be employed to further constrict the C(4) pocket for optimized activity with 3-chlorobenzoate. Overall, this work shows that CBL has excellent potential as a catalytic platform for the rational design of CoA thioesterification catalysts for use in activation of aromatic acids for bioremediation applications. Moreover, in a recent publication, Smith and co-workers (48) reported that a Trp to Gly replacement within the acetate binding site in acetylCoA synthetase switches the preference for acetate to a preference for valerate. Thus, the acyl adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily may serve as a rich source of designer catalysts for the synthesis of acyl-CoA thioesters. For those family members that participate in nonribosomal peptide antibiotic synthetic pathways (49-51), engineering substrate specificity may lead to the development of novel antibiotics.
