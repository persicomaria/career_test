Abstract Using UV­Vis, resonance Raman, and EPR spectroscopy we have studied the properties of the oxygenated ferrous cytochrome P450 from Sulfolobus Solfataricus, (CYP119). The recently determined crystal structure of CYP119 is compared with other available structures of P450s, and detailed structural and spectroscopic analyses are reported. With several structural similarities to CYP102, such as in-plane iron position and a shorter iron-proximal ligand bond, CYP119 shows low-spin conformation preference in the ferric form and partially in the ferrous form at low temperatures. These structural features can explain the fast autoxidation of the oxyferrous complex of CYP119. Finally, we report the first UV­Vis and EPR spectra of the cryoradiolytically reduced oxygenated intermediate of CYP119. The primary reduced intermediate, a hydroperoxo­ferric complex of CYP119, undergoes a `peroxide shunt' pathway during gradual annealing at 170­195 K and returns to the low-spin ferric form. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction The cytochromes P450 are heme proteins containing a protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group. Oxygen binding to the ferrous heme generates a diamagnetic oxygenated intermediate similar to that of oxy-hemoglobin or oxy-myoglobin. Oxygenated cytochrome P450 can decay in a oneelectron autoxidation process that releases a superoxide anion at a rate considerably faster [1,60] than that observed for the oxygen transport and storage proteins [2]. Additionally, this ferrous oxygenated intermediate can receive a second electron from the associated redox partner and

together with directed proton input can generate activated oxygen species, which are active in hydrocarbon chain oxidation [3] (Scheme 1).

Documenting the chemical and physical properties of the oxygenated cytochromes P450 is critical to the understanding of the enzymatic reaction mechanisms of the P450 monoxygenases [4]. The detailed knowledge of the properties and stability of active intermediates of P450 is also important for the wide range of potential applications of these enzymes in new biosensors, bioreactors, and other

artificial supramolecular constructs, as reviewed recently by Archakov and colleagues [5]. A thermostable cytochrome P450 CYP119 has recently been isolated from the acidothermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus and extensively characterized [6­9]. The highresolution X-ray structures of the ferric CYP119 were resolved with water [10], or imidazole and 4phenylimidazole [11] coordinated at the heme iron as the sixth ligand, and the structural basis for high thermostability of this enzyme was discussed [8,10,11]. In this paper, we have characterized the various oxygenated states of cytochrome P450 CYP119, reported the low temperature stabilization of the oxygenated intermediate of CYP119, and documented its autoxidation rate. In addition, we utilized the cryotrapping with radiolytic generation of in situ reducing equivalents to identify the two electron reduced peroxo­iron intermediate that immediately precedes oxygen­oxygen bond scission and subsequent oxygenase catalysis.

2. Materials and methods Cytochrome P450 CYP119 was cloned from the genomic DNA library of Sulfolobus solfataricus P1 and expressed and purified from E. coli as previously described [7,8]. Formation of the oxygenated intermediate was performed by reducing a sample of ferric CYP119 with dithionite in an anaerobic chamber with subsequent anaerobic chromatography (G25 column) to remove excess dithionite. The oxy-complex of the ferrous protein was prepared either in an aqueous buffer at 48C (for autoxidation kinetics experiments) or in aqueous­glycerol-buffered solutions at sub-zero temperatures (for cryogenic spectroscopy and radiolytic reduction experiments). In autoxidation experiments the deoxygenated solution of the ferrous CYP119 was cooled to 48C in the thermostatted holder of a home-built fast diode array spectrometer and then was oxygenated by the bubbling of oxygen gas and manual mixing for 2­3 s. The spectra in the 330­700 nm region were automatically taken every 2 s, starting 20 s before oxygenation so that the reference spectrum of the starting ferrous protein was obtained for each experiment. The resulting spectral matrix was then analyzed using the singular value decomposition method to estimate the number of the spectrally distinguishable components [12]. The autoxidation kinetic curves taken at different wavelengths were well described by the single exponential decay of the oxy-complex, although a minor faster second process was also observed. The resonance Raman characterization of Sulfolobus solfataricus P450 (CYP119) involved the use of laser excitation at 441.6 nm, near the 450 nm absorption band of the CO bound species, or at 413.1 nm, which is closer to resonance with the ferric resting state of the enzyme. Data were collected using a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD-based

Raman spectrometer described elsewhere [13], and samples were placed in a spinning sample cell, cooled by a gentle stream of nitrogen gas, to stabilize the protein near 48C. Cryogenic spectroscopy was performed in 100 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.6, containing 75% glycerol (v / v). Preparation of the reduced ferrous cytochrome P450 was carried out as described [14] under anaerobic conditions. The sample in the disposable UV-enhanced methacrylate semimicro spectroscopic cell (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) was sealed in the additional container and cooled to 2208C before oxygenation. Oxygen gas was bubbled through the cold viscous solution while stirring for 15­20 s. The oxygenated sample was quickly placed into a precooled cryostat and cooled to a temperature below 200 K within 1­2 min without direct contact with liquid nitrogen to prevent cracking and maintain the high optical quality of the frozen glassy solid solutions. These precautions were necessary because of rapid autoxidation of the oxygenated form of cytochrome CYP119 at higher temperatures (see Section 3). All spectra at cryogenic temperatures were taken in a Cary 3 UV­Vis spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia) with a homemade cryostat using liquid nitrogen as a cooling agent [14]. Frozen solutions of CYP119 in buffered 75% glycerol were irradiated at low temperature (immersed in liquid nitrogen at 77 K) at the Radiation Laboratory (Notre Dame University, IN, USA). Gamma irradiation from the Co-60 source was used at the dose rate of 21 krad / min for a total dose 4 megarad. The one-electron reduced forms of enzyme were stable below the glass transition temperature of the solvent (170 K) and could be studied by optical spectroscopy and EPR [15­18]. Gradual annealing at temperatures of about 170 K and above resulted in the relaxation of non-equilibrium forms of the cryogenically reduced enzyme. Before the optical experiments, the samples were illuminated at 77 K with the tungsten­ halogen lamp, using a cutoff filter with l .450 nm to prevent photolysis in Soret region for 8­12 min. This was done to bleach the strong absorption from the trapped electrons generated during radiolysis. The UV­Vis spectra were measured at temperatures between 80 and 240 K. The background was subtracted at each temperature using the separate set of UV­Vis spectra of buffered 75% glycerol irradiated and annealed in identical conditions. The yield of radiolytic reduction was estimated from the spectra in the Soret region as described [14], and the corresponding fraction of the initial spectrum was subtracted from the spectra of irradiated samples to obtain the spectra of the pure reduced intermediates. Preparation of the oxygenated intermediates for EPR measurement was the same as that for cryogenic UV­Vis spectroscopy, except that 15% glycerol was used. To avoid fast autoxidation, the samples were placed in EPR tubes and cooled to 210 8C in an ice­salt bath. Oxygen gas was slowly bubbled through the sample solutions for less than

30 s. For cryogenic radiolytic reduction the samples were irradiated together with the samples prepared for absorption spectroscopy in identical conditions at 77 K (see above). Electron paramagnetic resonance experiments were performed on a Varian E-122 X-band (9.08 GHz) spectrometer. Microwave power of 0.5 mW was used with modulation amplitude of 8 Gauss at 100 KHz. An Air Products, Allentown, PA, liquid helium flow system was used for measurements at 4­20 K. The cryoreduced samples were annealed at several temperatures above 77 K by immersing the sample tube in a cold bath at a fixed temperature for 1 min, then the sample was quickly brought back to 77 K, as described in previous studies with CYP101 [17,18].

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Characterization of the CYP119 resting state by Raman spectroscopy
As has been reported, cytochrome P450 CYP119 isolated from Sulfolobus solfataricus has optical spectra in the ferric, ferrous and ferrous­carbonmonoxy states essentially identical to the other well-characterized P450 systems such as CYP101 [7]. In addition, the X-band EPR signals of the low-spin ferric state with g52.4, 2.25, and 1.92 are also very similar to those reported for bacterial P450 CYP101 ( g52.45, 2.26, and 1.91) isolated from Pseudomonas putida [19]. In order to more precisely characterize the active site of the CYP119 resting state, we obtained resonance Raman spectra of the ferric, ferrous, and ferrous­carbonyl states. A similar study has been recently reported by Ortiz de Montellano and co-workers [9]. Fig. 1 shows the resonance Raman spectra of the resting enzyme taken at 413.1 and 441.6 nm. The resonance enhancement as the laser is tuned toward the absorption maximum is evident. Strong marker bands at 1374 cm 21 (n4 ) and 1585 cm 21 (n2 ) identify the ferric oxidation state and low-spin character of the resting state species. In Fig. 2, we plot Raman data from the CO bound species with isotopic substitution demonstrating the presence of the Fe­CO stretching band near 480 cm 21 . The frequency of the Fe­CO band is significantly downshifted from the frequencies found for histidine-ligated heme­CO complexes, which are typically near 510 cm 21 . However, it is typical of the value found for CO complexes that involve a cysteine-ligated heme. This shift arises from the strong donor nature of the thiolate ligand and its ability to compete for the iron d 2 orbital, which weakens the Fe­CO z s bond [20,21]. In addition, a strong p back-donation interaction between the iron d-orbitals and the CO antibonding orbitals leads to an inverse correlation between the CO and Fe­CO vibrational frequencies. In Fig. 2, we also note the position of the Fe­CO bending mode near 558 cm 21 in CYP119, and plot a correlation diagram

demonstrating that both the Fe­CO stretch and bend are down-shifted when thiolate is substituted for histidine as the ligand trans to CO. These results allow a clear assignment of the thiolate ligation in CYP119 and suggest that its distal pocket environment is quite similar to that of CYP101 in the presence of the substrate.

3.2. Characterization of the oxygenated intermediate of CYP119
As previously described, P450 CYP119 displays a high degree of thermo- and barostability which has been attributed to contribution from several factors, including the presence of a clustered aromatic region and the participation of several linked polar hydrogen bonding and packing attributes [8,11]. It is important to characterize the intermediates in the monoxygenase reaction cycle, and to ascertain if the archaeal origin of this cytochrome could be responsible for stabilizing heretofore uncharacterized states of heme, oxygen, and the substrate. With this goal in mind, we formed the ferrous oxygenated state of CYP119 as described in Section 2. Shown in Fig. 3 is the optical absorption spectrum in the near UV­Vis region, which has the characteristic 417 nm Soret absorption similar to the 418­419 nm previously reported for the mesophilic P450 CYP101 [1] and several other cytochromes P450 [22­26]. The Soret band for CYP119, however, has a higher amplitude and narrower bandwidth, and more closely

resembles the spectrum of the ferric low-spin resting state of this enzyme. The Q band with maximum at 564 nm and the shoulder at |535 nm also differs from the usual shape of the oxy-complexes of P450 enzymes with the maximum at 552­557 nm and the shoulder at |580 nm. The unusual spectral properties of the oxygenated ferrous CYP119 must be caused by changes in the structural parameters of the proximal thiolate ligand (see below) or by different interactions of the bound dioxygen molecule at the distal pocket of CYP119. The details of these interactions are not completely clear, especially since complexes with other ligands (CO and CN 2) as well as unliganded ferrous and ferric forms show absorption spectra quite similar to those

observed on CYP101 and other P450 enzymes (data not shown). The only other cytochrome P450 that was also reported to have such an unusual UV­Vis spectrum in the ferrous oxygenated state is the heme domain of cytochrome BM-3 (CYP102) in the substrate free [24] and substrate bound form [25]. A direct comparison with our results was not possible since the detailed spectra for substrate free oxygenated ferrous CYP102 were not published [24]. Although the spectra of oxyferrous complex of the substrate bound CYP102 [25] do not coincide with the spectra of the substrate free CYP119 measured in our work, they reveal similar features and are in general much closer to

those shown in Fig. 3 than all other published spectra of oxycytochromes P450. The authors [25] also showed the difference spectra (oxyferrous minus five-coordinated ferrous) of CYP 2B4, which look similar to those of CYP102. This unexpected similarity of the electronic absorption spectra of thermophilic CYP119, mesophilic cytochrome CYP102, and mammalian CYP 2B4 may be of certain functional importance, although a more detailed comparison of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of these enzymes is necessary. One more proof of the oxyferrous form of CYP119 formation is the weak temperature dependence of its absorption spectrum. Unlike strong temperature dependence of Soret bands of the ferric forms of CYP119 and CYP101, it shows only minor amplitude changes with the temperature lowered from 270

down to 77 K in 75% glycerol-buffer solution at pH 7.6, similar to the subtle changes in the spectra of oxyCYP101. Oxygenated CYP119 can autoxidize to produce the ferric enzyme and superoxide anion in a first order process (Fig. 3, insert) entirely analogous to the one which has been characterized in other P450 systems [1]. Clearly evident is the isosbestic point at 426 nm and the two-state behavior of the protein. Singular value decomposition of the kinetic spectral data sets confirms the presence of three spectral forms corresponding to ferrous deoxy-CYP119, oxy-complex, and the autoxidized ferric enzyme (the fourth singular value usually was 4­5 times smaller than the third, and less than 0.005 of the first one, i.e., below the typical signal-to-noise ratio). The autoxidation kinetics

are well described by a single exponential decay with rate constant of |0.08 s 21 at 58C. This rate, with no substrate bound, is significantly faster than that observed for the substrate free CYP101. The rapid autoxidation prevents a detailed thermodynamic description of the enthalpy and entropy of the reaction. Again, the remarkable similarity with the reported fast autoxidation of CYP102 is notable, for the substrate bound CYP102 heme domain the autoxidation rate constant is 0.032 s 21 at 58C [24]. The autoxidation rate for the substrate bound CYP102 at 2258C in 50% glycerol was measured as 0.0015 s 21 [25], so both rates are the order of magnitude higher than 0.002 s 21 at 28C and 0.0002 s 21 at ­208C measured for substrate free CYP101 [1]. It is worth mentioning that in the presence of the substrate the oxy-ferrous complexes of different cytochromes P450 are always much more stable with respect to autoxidation. Thus, the highest rate measured for CYP119 with no substrate bound is in agreement with this tendency.

3.3. Model structure for the CYP119 oxygenated intermediate
The three-dimensional X-ray structure of the oxidized protein has been solved independently by the Poulos and Shiro laboratories [10,11]. The protein displays the classic triangular shape seen in the other cytochrome P450s where structural information is available. Despite the overall similarity of the CYP119 structures and the structures of other cytochromes P450, the thermostable enzyme reveals several remarkable features in the pattern of porphyrin distortion and the iron­axial ligands geometry, which may be responsible for the observed spectral and kinetic differences. Several structural parameters are compared in Table 1. There are three aspects in which CYP119 differs notably from other substrate free P450s. One unique feature of the CYP119 structure is the position of the iron atom. Despite the absence of the strong sixth ligand in the ° substrate free structure, the iron atom is only 0.09 A out of

° the pyrrole nitrogen plane and 0.04 A out of the mean heme­pyrrole plane. In the substrate free CYP101 struc° ture (1PHC.PDB) [27] these distances are 0.30 and 0.24 A correspondingly. Even in the oxy-P450 (CYP101) structure [28], the iron atom is much more out of plane, i.e., ° 0.17 and 0.18 A from the mean plane through four pyrrole nitrogen atoms, and from the mean porphyrin plane correspondingly (PDB file 1DZ8.PDB). The only P450 structure with no substrate bound in which iron is also in the heme plane is that of CYP102 (1BU7.PDB) [29], where these distances are vanishingly small (0.01 and 0.00 ° A). The in-plane iron in substrate free ferric CYP119 indicates the general tendency of this enzyme to adopt the low-spin conformational state since the theoretical estimations for both ferric and ferrous porphyrins show clear preference of the low-spin ground state for in-plane iron and shorter iron­proximal ligand bonds [30,31]. Indeed, we observed the significant low-spin population of the ferrous CYP119 by changes in the UV­Vis spectra at low temperatures (Fig. 4). A second interesting feature is the much larger deviation of the Fe­S bond from the heme normal, 8.58 in substrate free CYP119 comparing to 28 in substrate free CYP101. This deviation from octahedral symmetry of iron coordination results also in much larger spread of the values of Np­Fe­S angles (Np5four pyrrole nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin) for CYP119. This is evident, for example, in comparison with the Np­Fe­S angles, which are within the range from 100.3 to 96.48 for substrate free CYP101 and much wider distribution of these angles from 99.3 to 84.78 for CYP119. This feature is evident even in liganded CYP119 structures 1F4U with imidazole as a sixth ligand, and 1F4T with phenyl imidazole [11]. Again, only in the CYP102 structure are the same deviation of the Fe­S bond from normal to the pyrrole nitrogens plane and the same asymmetry of Np­Fe­S angles observed (see Table 1). Third is the unusually large `ruffling' deformation of porphyrin, especially notable in the pyrrole A ring, combined with pronounced `saddling' in all CYP119 struc-

tures. This also shows the high degree of asymmetry of iron coordination geometry in CYP119 compared to substrate free CYP101. Once again, the general features of the porphyrin structure in CYP102 are similar to those described for CYP119, although in CYP102 the distortions of both pyrrole A and D are slightly smaller. In CYP119 the out-of-plane distortion of the pyrrole ring A may be caused by two strong hydrogen bonds formed between the heme propionic carboxyl oxygens and Arg259, the distances between the Arg259 side chain amine nitrogens and ° propionic oxygens are 2.92 and 2.77 A. The same pair of H-bonds is found in CYP101 and in P450eryf (CYP107A1), but not in P450nor (CYP55A1), P450 2C5, or chloroperoxidase. Different positioning of the side chain of Arg259 in CYP119 as compared to that of Arg299 in CYP101 with respect to the porphyrin plane certainly can cause different out-of-plane distortions of the pyrrole A ring. The strain generated by this deformation is partly relaxed through the redistribution of this excess stress of the heme resulting in changes in spectral and functional properties of the chemically identical heme­thiolate systems incorporated into different protein matrices. Interesting is the fact that this out-of-plane distortion of pyrrole A in CYP119 is in the opposite, proximal direction, as compared to the similar distortions in distal direction, which is observed in chloroperoxidase and to a lower extent in CYP101. Since free protoporphyrin has planar structure, these different distortions are caused by different

conformational restrictions imposed on the heme by the protein matrix. Different directions of out-of-plane deformations of pyrrole rings also shows the different type of the strain generated by heme­protein interactions in the Fe­S bond. Hence, the latter is expected to be shortened in CYP102 and CYP119. The expected shortening of the Fe­S bond will also stabilize the low-spin configuration of CYP119 and CYP102 as shown by DFT ab initio calculations [31]. The in-plane position of the Fe 31 atom in CYP119 and CYP102 reveals the preference for the low-spin configuration by itself [32]. This is confirmed by considerably stronger ruffling of the porphyrin in these two cytochromes in comparison with others [33]. This tendency is supported by the partial high-spin to low-spin transition observed by the temperature dependence of the UV­Vis spectra of the ferrous CYP119 (Fig. 4). The availability of the low-spin state in the thermal equilibrium with the high-spin state is a very unusual feature for ferrous heme proteins, which almost always are in the pure high-spin state in the absence of a strong sixth ligand [32­36]. Taken together, these structural properties of CYP119 show a slightly different heme environment in this thermostable cytochrome P450 as compared with other P450 enzymes. Some of these properties -- predominantly low-spin character of heme iron coordination and large deviation of the iron­sulfur bond from the heme normal -- may be responsible for unusual spectra and low stability, i.e., high

autoxidation rate of the oxygenated ferrous form of CYP119 as well as of CYP102. The thermodynamic stabilization of the ferrous state and corresponding destabilization of the ferric state, i.e., shift of the redox potential of the heme iron, as a result of the low-spin­ high-spin transition caused by substrate binding in cytochromes P450 is considered a cornerstone of the biological regulation of enzymatic activity in vivo [36]. A linear free energy relationship between the spin state of the ferric heme iron and the redox potential was later directly established for CYP101 [37]. As we have shown the substrate free ferric CYP119 is in low-spin state and even the ferrous CYP119 exists in thermal equilibrium between the high-spin and low-spin states. The higher thermodynamic stability of the low-spin state in this enzyme is likely to be responsible for the higher autoxidation rate of the oxyferrous CYP119 and, by analogy, of CYP102, as it is responsible for the kinetic control of putidaredoxin dependent reduction of ferric CYP101 [37]. The characteristic split Soret near-UV absorption band in low-spin thiolate-liganded ferrous porphyrins is described by Hanson et al. [38,39] as a result of the appearance of the new charge transfer transition between the vacant lone-pair of p-orbital of mercaptide sulfur, contrary to the mercaptan sulfur where the vacant pair is absent, and the porphyrin p-orbitals. This transition in the CO complex of cytochrome P450 mixes strongly with the Soret p­p* transition and results in the red shift of the original Soret band and appearance of the new component of Soret band with approximately the same integrated intensity as the usual one. With oxygen as a sixth ligand, recent calculations [40] show the intense coupling of porphyrin porbitals with vacant lone pairs of both axial ligands (see Table 5 in Ref. [40]). The experimental absorption spectra of several oxygenated cytochromes P450 show no red shift of the main Soret band (417­418 nm), but a much more pronounced second band at 350­355 nm is seen in the `hyper-porphyrin' type spectra. These bands taken separately usually have lower integrated intensity than the initial ferrous unliganded protein, thus, showing the similarity to the split Soret band of the ferrous­carbonmonoxy form of the same cytochromes, only without the red shift of the low-energy component of this transition. This similarity is confirmed by the recently found general correlation between the frequency shifts and the amplitude differences for these split Soret bands of the carbonmonoxy- and oxy-complexes of thiolate-liganded heme systems [41]. In the oxygenated ferrous CYP119, the shape of the spectrum in the near-UV region differs from the spectra of oxy-complexes of several other cytochromes P450. The main Soret band is sharper and has a significantly higher amplitude than the initial ferrous CYP119. The position of this band is the same as in other oxygenated P450s, 418 nm. The split Soret shape is much less pronounced, although the spectrum has another band at 354­356 nm, which is more intense than the N-band in the spectrum of

the ferric low-spin CYP119. The weakening of the hyper porphyrin features in the spectrum of oxy-CYP119 may be caused by the weaker coupling of the lone pairs of the unoccupied p-orbitals of the axial ligands (thiolate sulfur and dioxygen) with porphyrin p-orbitals, which in turn can be caused by the distortions of the symmetry of the axial ligation. Indeed, the notable deviation of the Fe­S bond from the normal to the porphyrin plane and the strong hydrogen bonding of the distal dioxygen ligand to the Thr213 hydroxyl group (see below) taken together may significantly weaken the orbital coupling between the axial ligands and the porphyrin and result in almost complete disappearance of the second, high-energy component of the Soret band at 355 nm. The published X-ray structures for CYP119 provide an important road map for discussing the detailed oxygenase reaction mechanism and, in particular, the pocket residues that may play a role in the reactivity of the oxygen liganded intermediate. Recently, Schlichting and co-workers were able to utilize cryocrystallography to determine the precise three-dimensional structure of the ferrous oxygenated intermediate of P450 CYP101 [28]. Using the coordinates of the dioxygen-bound form from this investigation together with the highly homologous active site structures determined for CYP119 and CYP101, we modeled the dioxygen coordination to the CYP119 heme and performed several rounds of energy minimization. Fig. 5 is the result of this exercise. The porphyrins with the axial ligands and the homologous threonine residues are superimposed in the frame associated with four pyrrole nitrogens of the hemes. From the comparison of these two structures it is clear that the dioxygen ligand occupies the same position with almost identical distances of the distal oxygen atom to alcohol oxygen of threonine close enough

to form a hydrogen bond. There are no particular differences except the different pattern of porphyrin distortions described above.

3.4. Radiolytic reduction of the oxygenated intermediate of P450 CYP119
The previous results unambiguously demonstrate that cytochrome P450 CYP119 can form a ferrous oxygenated state analogous to this key intermediate that has been described in other P450 systems. Recently, low temperature cryoreduction and trapping experiments have permitted the documentation of the two electron reduced `peroxo' intermediate as well as several liganded product alcohol complexes in the camphor hydroxylase CYP101 [14,16­ 18]. Such radiolytic reduction reactions have utilized highenergy photons, either from cobalt-60 gamma decay or X-rays from a synchrotron source, to generate solvated electrons as the primary product of solvent water radiolysis. These electrons react with the heme and reduce iron. As a result, the reduced oxy complex is formed and accumulated since it is stable at the temperatures below the glass transition of the solvent. Such methods of preparation of the unstable enzyme reactive complexes trapped in the

solid matrix of the frozen solvent were used in several recent structural and mechanistic studies [14,16­18,42­ 50]. The same method for introducing the second electron was employed on the oxy form of CYP119 in an attempt to capture the reaction intermediates of this thermostable cytochrome P450. Both UV­Vis and EPR spectroscopies were used to characterize the cryotrapped intermediates in a similar fashion as reported previously [14,17,18]. Radiolytic reduction of the oxy form of CYP119 results in formation of the similar intermediate as for CYP101 [14] with a Soret maximum at 440 nm, presumably the hydroperoxo complex of CYP119 (Fig. 6). Spectra of the primary product of radiolytic reduction in the Soret region are very similar to those measured earlier with radiolytically reduced CYP101. However, in visible region the spectrum of the reduced oxy CYP119 has the sharp peak at 560 nm typical for the hexacoordinated low-spin ferrous porphyrins (Fig. 6). This peak is shifted by 2 nm and significantly less intense than the spectrum of the cryogenically reduced ferric CYP119. The spectrum of the latter, the cryotrapped ferrous low-spin CYP119 with water as the sixth ligand, is shown in the Fig. 6 for comparison. The replacement of the sixth ligand by presumably the hydroperoxide anion can explain this

UV­Vis spectra of the pure reduced oxy-CYP119 are calculated from experimental spectra with subtraction of the background and unreduced species, as described in Section 2. *Spectrum of the ferric CYP119, reduced at 77 K, which gives predominantly low-spin ferrous CYP119 trapped at low temperature glass, given for comparison.

difference. It is necessary to point out that at low temperatures (from 77 K up to 160­170 K) the reduced protein is frozen in the aqueous­glycerol matrix and cannot undergo the complete conformational relaxation to the new equilibrium reduced state. This is why the ferrous CYP119 obtained via radiolytic reduction of the ferric protein at 77 K is inevitably at the low-spin state. The configuration in which it was frozen before irradiation can not change while below the glass transition temperature of the solvent, and the protein can relax to the equilibrium predominantly high-spin state in the absence of the strong sixth ligand only after annealing at or above the glass transition temperature [15,43,44,51­53]. The input of the electron into the oxygenated intermediate of CYP119 was also confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. The EPR spectrum of the oxygenated ferrous form of CYP119 after irradiation at 77 K and subsequent annealing at 150 K is shown in Fig. 7 (solid line). In addition to the strong signals arising from the organic radicals at g52, several low-field components were also observed. A small amount of ferric species gives rise to a minor signal at gx 52.4, and the expected gy 52.25 ferric signal overlaps with the two rhombic features of the reduced oxygenated intermediate at g52.29 and 2.20. These g-values are similar to the reported g-values of the `ferric­peroxo' CYP101 (2.3, 2.17, and 1.97). With the trace amount of the ferric form present in the sample, it is difficult for one to visualize the three components in the broad spectral feature in the g52.25 region. Moreover, the spectra exhibit a broader line width than those for the low-spin ferric form (Fig. 7, bold line), which makes it even more difficult to deduce the g-values for the reduced

Fig. 7. The X-band EPR spectra of various forms of CYP119 at 19 K. EPR spectra of the low-spin ferric CYP119, radiolytically reduced oxyCYP119 with less ferric content, and radiolytically reduced oxy-CYP119 with higher ferric content are shown as dotted, solid, and bold lines, respectively. The g-values of these species are also depicted in the figure.

oxygenated intermediate. With a higher concentration of the ferric form present in the EPR sample, the two components of the reduced oxygenated intermediate become obvious (Fig. 7, dashed line). Unfortunately, the third spectral component of the reduced oxygenated intermediate at a higher magnetic field ( g|1.95) is buried within the strong radical signals. The annealing of the radiolytically reduced oxy-complex of CYP119 shows two processes (Fig. 6). The primary intermediate, the hydroperoxo­heme complex is stable below 160 K, then it begins to undergo the gradual relaxation and transformation to a new species with the Soret maximum at 413­416 nm. This new intermediate is most likely the low-spin ferric complex with the sixth ligand either the solvent water or the protonated hydroperoxo anion. Since there is no specific substrate bound in the vicinity of the heme iron, the catalytic decomposition of the possibly reactive hydroperoxo­heme complex is unlikely. The only possible alternative to the production of hydrogen peroxide from the bound dioxygen molecule through the protonation of the proximal oxygen atom and oxidation of the heme iron back to the ferric state would be the catalytic decomposition of the solvent glycerol molecule. Since we did not detect any sign of the formation of the product­heme complex in UV­Vis and EPR spectra, the latter path is somewhat obscure, although the possibility of the glycerol decomposition in the active site of CYP119 remains an unexplored side process. The simplest model, which explains our observations, is the so-called `peroxide shunt', the formation of hydrogen peroxide from the bound oxygen and the return of the enzyme to the resting ferric state. During the annealing of the reduced oxy-CYP119 we observed two transitions. The first one at 165­177 K is revealed by the disappearance of the Soret band at 440 nm and an increase in absorption at 414­416 nm. This may be explained by the relaxation of the hydroperoxo­heme complex and possibly a second protonation of the bound oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide bound to the heme iron. Although we can not exclude the dissociation of this hydrogen peroxide and the replacement of the sixth ligand by solvent water, the latter possibility is less probable taking into account the low temperature and limited diffusion in the range of the solvent glass transition. The second transition at 180­195 K is the formation of the carbonmonoxy­ferrous heme complex of the enzyme reduced by the products of the solvent radiolysis. This happens because a significant amount of the reducing equivalents is accumulated as a result of radiolysis of aqueous­glycerol frozen glasses. After melting of such a sample, the ferric heme proteins are reduced and bind CO -- the product of alcohol radiolysis [52,54,55]. We have also shown in the independent control experiment that ferric myoglobin (Mb) was reduced and quantitatively transformed to MbCO after the aliquot of the concentrated metMb solution was diluted into the ten-fold larger volume

of the freshly thawed irradiated buffer­glycerol solvent, which was prepared and irradiated in identical conditions for the background control. Additionally, annealing of the radiolytically reduced oxy-CYP119 was also investigated by means of EPR. Fig. 8 shows the EPR spectra as the sample was warmed up stepwise from 150 to 210 K. For comparison, the EPR spectrum of the low-spin ferric CYP119 is also shown in Fig. 8 (bottom trace). In the annealing process, only one clear transition was observed at 180 K. At temperature higher than 180 K, the signal of the `ferric­peroxo' intermediate starts to decrease ( g52.20 and 2.29), while the intensity of the low-spin ferric form increases ( g52.25 and 2.4). These results are best explained by the `peroxide shunt' mechanism discussed above. Gradual warming of the radiolytically reduced CYP119 results in conformational relaxation of the protein and chemical changes. Because of the lack of substrate in CYP119 we observe simpler relaxation of this intermediate

with annealing of this sample than with CYP101 in the ternary complex of the enzyme with the substrate camphor and dioxygen molecule. In CYP101 the primary intermediate relaxed in the heme pocket, underwent one more protonation and formed the product, 5-exo-hydroxycamphor, presumably through the transient reactive oxoferryl radical intermediate, Compound I [18]. However, no evidence was observed for a stable Compound I using UV­Vis and EPR spectroscopy even with careful annealing of radiolytically reduced oxy-CYP101 at 190 K. The fast disappearance of this key hydroxylating intermediate is the sign of the high reactivity of the substrate bound complex even at this low temperature. In the absence of the substrate, as in the case of CYP119, we could expect the longer lifetime of `isolated' Compound I. However, the experimental data do not contain any sign of an accumulation of the oxo-ferryl porphyrin p-cation radical species with a distinct broad blue-shifted Soret band and significant absorbance at 650­680 nm.

4. Conclusions In this work, we have employed several spectroscopic methods to study not only the resting state of the thermostable cytochrome P450 CYP119 but also its important reactive oxygenated intermediates by means of cryotrapping. Together with the available crystal structures of P450s, detailed structural and spectroscopic analyses were reported. With several structural similarities to CYP102, such as in-plane iron position and shorter iron­proximal ligand bond, CYP119 shows a low-spin conformation preference both in the ferric and, to a certain extent, even in the ferrous forms. These structural features can explain the fast autoxidation of the oxy-ferrous complex of CYP119. Finally, the first UV­Vis and EPR spectroscopic characterizations of the reduced oxygenated intermediate of CYP119 were also reported. The `enzymatic pathway' is followed by annealing of the cryoreduced sample. Because of the absence of the specific substrate of this thermostable cytochrome P450, it was possible that the reactive species, `Compound I', might have a longer lifetime. However, the enzyme appears to undergo a `peroxide shunt' mechanism, and the reduced oxygenated intermediate, the `ferricperoxo' form, turns into the low-spin ferric form upon annealing.
