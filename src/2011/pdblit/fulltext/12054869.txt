Summary m The elucidation of the role of the four hemes in cytochromes c3 requires several complementaryapproaches. The measurement and the assignment of the redox potentials resort to magnetic spectroscopies, EPR and NMR, which are able to discriminate the heroes. The origin of the differences between the redox properties of the heroes can be studied by comparing their thermodynamic parameters AS and AH, as measured by the temperature dependence of their individual potentials. Lastly, the available data concerning the electron exchange between cytochromes c3 and their redox partners can be analysed through a detailed kinetic model which provides important information on the role of the different heroes. cytochromes / cytochromes c3 / electron transfer / kinetics

Introduction

In sulfate-reducing bacteria, cytochromes c3 enable the reversible electron transfer between hydrogenases and ferredoxins or flavodoxins. These cytochromes of M, ~13 000 possess four c-type hemes axially coordinated to two histidine residues. They have been the subject of numerous spectroscopic, potentiometric and kinetic studies, and their X-ray crystal structure has been established for several species [1-4]. In spite of this, little is known about the role of each heine in the electron exchange mechanisms. This lack of information is all the more unfortunate since closely related cytochromes of unknown function possessing eight or even 16 hemes have been discovered in these microorganisms [5]. This is probably related to the fact that the different hemes cannot be discriminated by their optical spectrum, so that the usual potentiometric and kinetic techniques which are based on UVvisible absorbance measurements do not give direct information about the characteristics of each center. In order to elucidate the role of each heme defined in the three-dimensional structure, it is first necessary to determine its redox potential. At this point, it is worth recalling that a system of multicenter proteins can be characterized by two kinds of thermodynamic quantities: global or 'macroscopic' quantities and individual or 'microscopic' quantities. For a protein like cytochrome ca which contains four redox centers,

four macroscopic potentials E,, n=l--4, and 32 microscopic potentials ei kl, i = 1 - 4 , can be defined. The subscript i labels a particular heme and j, k, I label the three other hemes which can be oxidized or reduced. E, represents the midpoint potential characterizing the acceptance of an n-th electron by the system. Its value can be determined by electrochemical methods or by potentiometric titrations monitored by a spectroscopic technique enabling the measurement of the concentration of the total number of oxidized or reduced centers, like UV-visible spectrometry. In general, the En differ from the ei kl. For example, in the simple case of a protein containing four independent redox sites characterized by the same midpoint potential e, the macroscopic potentials are given by El = e + (RT/~.,~)Ln4, E2 = e + (RT/~)Ln3/2, E3 = e (RT/~')Ln3/2, E4 = e - (RT/,."f)Ln4, and spread a 70 mV range at 25°C. In fact, the E, coincide with s o n ~ ei kl only when their values are well separated, a situation which is rarely encountered in the case of cytochromes c3. Thus, it appears that electrochemical and UV-visible absorbance measurements alone are not sufficient to determine the individual potentials of the hemes in these proteins. The same problem arises when one considers the kinetic experiments that were performed to study the electron transfer between cytochrome c3 and its redox partners [6--8] or artificial donors [9-12]. The experiments were followed by electrochemistry or optical spectroscopy, and their

525 results were analysed on the basis o f simplified models in which the individual characteristics of each h e m e were not considered. The four h e m e s o f cytochrome c3 cannot be distinguished one from another by UV-visible spectroscopy because they have the same coordination. However, they are m a g n e t i c a l l y inequivalent in the paramagnetic oxidized state, a property which has been exploited by the different groups w h o have studied cytochromes ca by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The origin o f this inequivalence is discussed in the first section of this paper. We first demonstrate that the E P R spectrum o f these proteins can be considered as the simple superimposition o f four components, each o f them being characterized by a particular set of gvalues. The results o f single crystal E P R studies reveal that these values are determined to a great extent by the angle between the planes o f the two axially coordinated imidazoles, in agreement with a n u m b e r o f studies carried out on model porphyrins. This simple magneto-structural relation can be used to attribute the spectral c o m p o n e n t s to the hemes Hk defined in the three-dimensional structure. In a second part we recall how the microscopic potentials o f the four redox sites h, can be deduced from a potentiometric titration monitored by E P R , and how the correspondence between the redox sites h~ and the hemes Hk can be established. The next step consists o f elucidating the origin of the redox inequivalence between the hemes, an important point that is often discussed in the literature. A new approach to this issue is presented in the third section, which is based on the experimental determination o f the t h e r m o d y n a m i c parameters characterising the redox free energy variation o f the four hemes. Finally, we present in the last section a detailed kinetic m o d e l to interpret the kinetics o f the electron exchange between cytochrome c3 and its redox partners. Its application to the reversible electron exchange between cytochrome ca and ferredoxin I o f Desulfovibrio desulfuricans N o r w a y demonstrates that the heme involved in the intermolecular electron transfer is a low potential heme, in a g r e e m e n t with the results o f the second section. absorbance of the mediators was negligible. Variable temperature experiments were carried out according to a non-isothermal cell arrangement: the optical cell containing the protein solution, a platinum electrode and a calibrated thermocouple was placed in a variable temperature holder. This cell was electrically connected through a flexible KC! (3 M) salt bridge to a second cel~ containing the Ag/AgCI-KCI (3 M) reference electrode which was kept at 24°C (+208 mV vs NHE). In these conditions, the temperature coefficient dEJdT of the midpoint potential E., measured between the two electrodes is directly proportional to the entropy variation ASRc = Sreo--Sox of the studied redox couple, if Em is corrected for the thermal junction potentials [14]. The sum of the junction potentials, evaluated by replacing the protein solution by a 100 mM Tris-HC! (pH 7.9) solution, was found to vary from 3 mV at 8°C to 6 mV at 36°C. In the text, all potential values are given with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode. Numerical simulations of EPR spectra given by magnetically isolated hemes were based on the usual g-strain procedure [ 15l. In this method, the distribution of the ~ tensor around a fixed value g0 is described by a three-dimensional tensor ~ whose principal elements are random variables characterized by their standard deviations t~. Good simulations were achieved by assuming that g0 and "~ are collinear and by taking the random variables to be fully positively correlated. The spectrum resulting from the dipolar interactions between hemes HI and H3 of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway cytochrome c3 was calculated by using the program POINTDIP [ 16] and the structural parameters given by the single-crystal EPR study [ 171 and a refined crystal structure at 1.7 A resolution (Czjzeck M, Haser R, personal communication). The rate equations corresponding to the kinetic scheme presented in the last section were solved numerically by using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method which is briefly recalled thereafter. Let x, represent the concentration of any species involved in the kinetic scheme. The rate equations can be written in a matrix form:

F(X)
where X is the column matrix built from the x,. The value of XL÷~ = X(k + At) is calculated from Xt by using the following expressions: Xk. I = Xk + (i/6) [K0 + 2KI + 2K, + K31 Ko = At F(XD K t = At F(Xr+ K0/2) K~ = At F(X~+ K~/2) K3 = At F(Xt+ K_,) The convergence of this procedure was checked by. varying the integration step At, and by comparing the equilibrmm concentration values given by the rate equations to those calculated directly from the redox potentials and the initial concentrations.

Materials and methods
The samples of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki cytochrome ca used in this study were described in a previous work [13]. Redox titration monitored by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy was performed in a 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) solution kept under argon atmosphere. The protein concentration was 6 IaM. The potentials were adjusted with small amounts of a concentrated solution of sodium dithionite in the presence of phenosafranine (-255 mV), benzyl viologen (-350 mV) and methyl viologen (--440 mV), each at 1.3 laM concentration. Absorbance variations were followed at 552 nm, where the

Interpretation of the EPR spectrum given by cytochromes cs
In all known cytochromes c3, the four hemes are axially coordinated by two histidine residues. This gives a low-spin state to the iron atoms, S = l / 2 and S=0 in the ferric and ferrous form, respectively. The same bis-histidine coordination is found in some soluble m o n o h e m e b-type cytochromes, like bovine

526 microsomal cytochrome b5 [18] and yeast flavocytochrome b., [ 19]. In these proteins, the axial imidazole planes are nearly parallel, and a rhombic EPR spectrum characterized by gx~l.4, g:--2.2, g:-3.0 is observed [20-22]. Other b-type hemes are present in membrane-bound proteins involved in the electron transfer systems of mitochondria or chloroplasts. Although these hemes possess the same axial coordination, they give a very different spectrum characterized by a unique peak at gm.-,x> 3.3, other features usually not being detected [23]. A number of studies carded out on model iron porphyrins axially coordinated to two imidazole or pyridine ligands have cle:.u'ly demonstrated that such a 'large gmax' type spectrum is observed when the two ligand planes are perpendicularly disposed, whereas the usual rhombic spectrum is observed when the ligand planes are parallel [24-27]. This magneto-structural relation can be simply rationalized in the framework of the 't2~ hole model'. According to this model, the ~-tensor components can be expressed in terms of an axiality parameter p and a rhombicity parameter R, which describe the ligand field experienced by the ferric ion [28]. The variations of the ~-tensor components predicted by this model as a function of R are represented in figure I for different values of 0. The values IJ= 3.34, R=1.70 account for the g values of flavocytochrome b2 (fig I) [281. The variations observed in figure 1 provide a simple explanation t'or the two types of spectra given by hemes or porphyrinic complexes axially coordinated to two planar ligands: a nearly parallel orientation of the two iigands leads to a highly rhombic symmetry corresponding to a large value of R giving gm,~~3.0, whereas a quasi perpendicular orientation leads to a more axial symmetry corresponding to a small value of R and a large g,,~,. Although this orientation factor is expected to be dominant in the case of a bis-histidine coordination, other factors may modulate the values of 1~ and R, like the Fe-N bond length and the orientation of the imidazole planes with respect to the Fe-Np bonds [25, 29]. We now consider the case of tetraheme cvtochromes c3. A first complication may arise from'the very multicenter character of these proteins: in cytochromes c+ of known three-dimensional structure, like those from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway, Desulfovibrio vul~garis Miyazaki, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hiidenborough, the compact arrangement of the hemes is such that iron-to-iron distances are comprised between I l and 17 A [ l-4l. For other metalloproteins in which the metal centers are separated by similar distances, like clostridial ferredoxins [30], photosystem I [311, Xanthine oxidase [t6], complex frequency-dependent EPR spectra arising from intercenter magnetic interactions are observed.

less, EPR spectra given by frozen solutions of oxidized cytochromes c3 are well simulated by simply adding four components characterized by different values of p and R [281. This suggests that the hemes behave as if they were magnetically isolated in the protein, a situation that may arise either from a particular 'magic' magnetic configuration, or from a large intrinsic linewidth masking the intercenter magnetic coupling. It is important to clarify this point, which is essential for a correct interpretation of EPR spectra given by other cytochromes c3 and more generally by other muitiheme cytochromes [5, 321. We have then undertaken a quantitative study of the magnetic interaction between the pair of closest hemes (H~,H3) in D de~ulfuricans Norway cytochrome c3, for which the dipolar coupling is expected to be maximun. Singlecrystal EPR experiments have demonstrated that the g, components of these hemes are equal to 3.00 and 2.92, respectively [17]. These experiments have also provided the orientation of the magnetic axes of H~ and H3 with respect to the crystal axes, an information which can be used to determine the structural parameters required for the calculation of the interaction spectrum: t h e ~ e t e r s (r, 0, ~) defining the intercenter vector Fe3Fel with respect to the magnetic axes

methods): the H3 component can be obtained by subtracting the spectrum given by a sample poised at - 2 0 0 m V from that given by a fully oxidized sample [32], and its simulation is represented in figure 2a. Although the quality of the difference spectrum is not perfect, its linewidth is well reproduced by the simulation. The H, component was simulated by adjusting the g-strain parameters so as to reproduce the linewidth of its spectral features visible on the spectrum given by the sample poised at - 2 0 0 mV [32]. The g values and a values given by these simulations are reported in table I, and the spectrum obtained by adding the two simulated components is represented in figure 2b. The interaction spectrum calculated from the program P O I N T D I P by using the structural parameters of table I is represented in figure 2c.

528 dipolar coupling between H~ and H3 led to spectra essentially identical to that of figure 2c. This clearly demonstrates that the lack of apparent magnetic coupling effects is not due to a particular geometric configuration, but results from the large intrinsic linewidth of the berne spectral components. As a matter of fact, the widths at half height of the g~ peak are equal to 6.5 mT and 7.8 mT for H~ and H3, respectively [33]. Since the magnetic coupling effects are expected to be maximal for the (H~, H3) pair, which is characterized by" both the shortest iron-to-iron distance and the smaller linewidth, we can safely extend this conclusion to the other hemes of D desuifuricans Norway cytochrome c3. More generally, this study demonstrates that the EPR spectra of muitiheme cytochromes are expected to be uncomplicated by inter-heine magnetic interactions as far as the intrinsic linewidths are broader than 6 mT and the iron-to-iron distances are greater than I 1 A. Inter-heme magnetic interactions have been reported for the hexa-heme nitrite reductase from Wolinella succinogenes [34], cytochrome c554 and the hydroxylamine oxidoreductase from Nitrosomonas europeae [35] and the diheme cytochrome from Pseudomonas stutzeri [36], for which the linewidths are similar to those observed in cytochromes c.~. If these interactions are predominantly dipolar in origin, they reflect iron-to-iron distances shorter than I ! A. We now examine if the magneto-structural relation observed in monoheme proteins and porphyrin complexes coordinated by two planar axial ligands also holds for the EPR spectral components of cytochromes c~. In the case of D desulfuricans Norway cytochrome c~, the single crystal EPR study has shown that the components characterized by g~,,, = 2.94, 3.00, 3.12, 3.37 correspond to H3(26°), Hm(5°), He(49°), H4(77°), respectively [17]. The value in brackets represent the dihedral angles between the imidazole planes of the axial iigands,o as given by a refined X-ray crystal structure at 1.7 A resolution (Czjzeck M, Haser R, personal communication). This attribution confirms that this angular parameter determines to a large extent the gm.,~value and, more generally, the magnetic characteristics of the hemes. This property can be exploited to assign some spectral components in other cytochromes c3. For example, the numerical simulation of the frozen solution spectrum of D vuigaris Miyazaki cytochrome c3 led to five components, one heme being present under two different conformations A and B [ 13]. The corresponding gm..,xvalues are: 2.75, 2.81(B), 2.93(A), 2.97, 3.29. According to the X-ray crystal structure, heme H2 is characterized by a large value (64 °) of the angle between the two imidazole ligands, whereas the three other hemes are characterized by ~alues less than 8 ° [2]. From the preceding discussion, we deduce that the component with gmax - - 3.29 originates from heme H 2 . This assignment, which was already proposed a few years ago [37, 38], appears now to be supported by a full body of experimental data.

Properties and assignment of the redox sites
In the preceding section, we have shown that the EPR spectra given by a solution of cytochrome c3 could be considered as a superimposition of four components, each of them corresponding to a particular heme. This constitutes the basis for a detailed study of their redox properties through a potentiometric titration monitored by EPR. The spectra provided by such a titration can be handled by two different methods. The first one consists of studying the variations of the integrated intensity of the whole spectrum as a function of the applied potential If the parameter ga,, which character. ~zes the mean transmon probabd~ty [39] is the same for the different heroes, a condition which is usually well satisfied for multiheme cytochromes, the integrated intensity is proportional to the total number of oxidized hemes in the studied sample, and the macroscopic potentials E. can be deduced from its variations. In the second method, the variations of the amplitude of each spectral component are studied. Since these components overlap largely in multiheme cytochromes, a detailed quantitative analysis requires a numerical simulation of the spectra recorded at every potential. The advantage of this procedure is that, in principle, it allows the detcrmination of the whole set of microscopic parameters characterizing the four redox sites. This set must be consistent with the four macroscopic potentials E~ deduced from the integrated intensity variations. In earlier works, we have successfully applied these methods to study the redox properties of D desulfuricans Norway and D vulgaris Miyazaki cytochromes c3 [13, 33]. In both cases, the values of the macroscopic potentials were found identical to those given by a potentiometric titration monitored by UV-visible absorbance measurements which were carried out at the same temperature [13, 33]. The macroscopic potentials of D desulfuricans Norway cytochrome c3 measured by electrochemistry were dependent on the technique used, but they were in general agreement with the values given by potentiometric experiments [40, 41]. In the case of D vulgaris Miyazaki cytochrome c3, a recent study carried out by NMR spectroscopy offered the opportunity to compare the results given by different methods [42]. However, no comparison with the data published in the former work [13] was developed in [42]. We have recalled the results of both these studies in table II, by using the notations of [13]: ei (labelled in order of decreasing value) is the

redox potential of site i when all other sites are reduced, and the interaction potentials are defined by li~ -- e:-eJ~, where ei~, is the redox potential of site i when site j is oxidized. Note that an inaccuracy of :!: 1 mV was claimed in [42]. Significant differences between the values of the macroscopic and microscopic potentials given by the two methods are apparent in table II. We shall see in the next section that the macroscopic potentials of this cytochrome are temperature dependent, and that the differences observed in table II reflect essentially the different temperatures of the two titrations. Although the same explanation may hold for the microscopic potentials, part of the differences observed in table II may have a methodological origin. It is worth recalling that the EPR data are necessarily collected on samples frozen at cryogenic temperatures. In some cases, it may happen that the redox equilibrium probed by EPR differs from that poised during the redox titration carried out at room temperature [431. In the case of D vulgaris Miyazaki cytochrome c , the values of the macroscopic potentials measured by EPR are fully consistent with those given by spectroscopic techniques for which the sample is maintained at room temperature, like UVvisible spectrophotometry and NMR. This means that if any shift of the redox equilibrium induced by the freezing process occurred, it might only originate from variations of the intramolccular equilibrium leaving the macroscopic populations unchanged. After the characterization of the redox sites, the next step is to assign them to the hemes Hk defined in the three-dimensional structure. A striking peculiarity of D desulfuricans Norway cytochrome c3 is the existence of a site characterized by a potential o f - 1 5 0 mV, well separated from the three others which fall in the more usual range o f - 3 0 0 mV to - 3 5 0 inV. In this

situation, the macroscopic potential El is identical to the microscopic potential e TM. This peculiarity of D desulfuricans Norway cytochrome c3 has prompted several studies aimed at identifying the highest potential heine in this protein. These studies have focused initially on H4, which is believed to play an important role in the electron exchange between cytochrome c3 and its redox partners [44, 45]. Although the formation of the 1:1 complex between cytochrome c3 and ferredoxin I did affect neither the EPR spectrum nor the redox properties of the cytochrome, [46], it was accompanied by a shift of the NMR methyl resonances of the two highest potential hemes [47]. The chemical modification of Arg 173, an amino acid close to heme H4, led to similar spectral shifts and to variations of the macroscopic potentials El and Ez equal to -50 mV and -20 mV, respectively [48]. These observations were interpreted as producing evidence for H4 being the heme with highest potential [47, 48]. A number of recent studies have put into evidence the ability of proteins to transmit the modification of a particular site to more distant part of the molecule, thus affecting their structural and eventually their thermodynamic characteristics [49]. For the time being, these complex effects cannot be reliably predicted and may complicate attributions based on chemically or genetically modified proteins. In the case of cytochromes c3, a more direct method consists of exploiting the relation between the stuctural and magnetic properties of the heroes in the native protein. In the preceding section, we have recalled the correspondence between the EPR spectral components and the hemes H~ established by single crystal EPR experiments. This correspondence, together with the results of redox titration monitored by EPR, indicates that H 4 is a low potential heine and that the highest potential heme is H3 [17]. The same conclusion was reached recently from a detailed NMR study carried out on this cytochrome [50]. We shall see in the last section that the attribution of a low potential to H4 is fully consistent with the monophasic character of the electron transfer kinetics observed during the reversible eletron exchange between cytochrome c3 and ferredoxin I [6]. In D desulfuricans Norway cytochrome c3, the spectral identification of the heme with the highest redox potential is unambiguous because its potential is much less negative than the other three. The assignment of redox potentials separated by a few tens of mV is a much more difficult task. As a matter of fact, different attributions have been proposed by several groups working oo the same protein. In the preceding s,ection, we have shown that heine H2 of cytochrome c3 from D vuigaris Miyazaki gives an EPR spectral component characterized by gmax" - 3.29. According to the redox titration monitored by EPR, this component

530 corresponds to the redox site characterized by e3 = -335 mV ii31. This attribution has been challenged in the NMR study carried out on this protein, which has concluded that H,. corresponds to a redox site with e4 = --356 mV 1511. As already mentioned, this discrepancy may be explained if the freezing process inherent to the EPR measurements gives a shift of e4 from -356 mV at room temperature to an apparent potential equal to -335 mV at cryogenic temperatures. Another possibility is that the assignment proposed in 1511 is erroneous. This is made plausible by a ~ecent NMR study [521 carded out on cytochrome c3 from D vulgaris Hildenborough, a protein whose structure and redox properties are closely related to those of D vulgaris Miyazaki cytochrome c3. In this study it was concluded that H., possesses the second or the third more negative potential, an attribution consistent with that given by the EPR experiments. When the potentials of the hemes are close one from another, their assignment is difficult because even their absolute ordering may become ambiguous. This may arise from: i) the insufficient accuracy of the measurements; ii) the temperature dependence of the ordering (see next section); iii) the existence of interaction potentials whose magnitude and signs are such that the ordering of the microscopic potentials depends on the particular macroscopic redox step that is considered. Finally, it may be thought that uncertainties in the attribution of the sets of microscopic potentials to the heroes do not constitute a limitation for the understanding of their functional role as far as the different sets are close one from another. distribution of the protein in both the oxidized and reduced states. A more empirical approach consists of measuring and comparing the entha[pic and entropic contributions to the redox free energy of the hemes. We have undertaken a systematic study of these thermodynamic quantities in a series of monoheme and tetraheme cytochromes, and we report in this section the results of the experiments carried out on D vulgaris Miyazaki cytochrome c3. Potentiometric titrations monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry were carried out between 8°C and 36°C accolding to the non-isothermal cell arrangement described in Materials and methods, and the macroscopic potentials E, were determined by fitting the absorbance variations to theoretical curves. The accuracy of these measurements was + 5 mV over the whole temperature range. The variations of the E, as a function of temperature are represented in figure 3. We observe that the En values given by electrochemistry at 25°C [551 and by NMR at 30°C [42], are consistent with those measured in the present work. The problem consists of extracting the temperature dependence of the ten microscopic potentials from these data. Although this problem is mathematically indeterminate, it can be solved approximately in the following way. We first observe that Ej is well separated from the three other potentials in the lower temperature range, where it approaches the microscopic potential e~34. In this temperature range, the values of E.,, E a, E4 depend essentially on the microscopic potential of the three other redox sites. Taken together, the data of figure 3 suggest that the temperature dependence of E~ is largely determined by that of e TM, and that the microscopic potentials of the three other sites are very weakly temperature dependent. In the following, we show that this qualitative analysis is supported by calculations in which the interaction potentials lij are assumed constant over the range 836°C. The interaction potential I U represents the variation of potential of site i induced by the reduction of site j. It includes a purely electrostatic contribution of negative signs, and another contribution due to transmitted conformational changes, which can be of either sign. These long-range indirect effects are essentially determined by the overall structure of the protein, which is likely to vary little in the temperature range of interest. Therefore, we have attempted to infer the temperature dependence of the microscopic potentials by assuming that it originates essentially from direct local variations, long distance effects giving only higher order contributions. Two different sets of interaction potentials, (A) and (B), have been proposed for cytochrome c3 from D vuigaris Miyazaki (table II). These two sets, together with the microscopic potentials ei, were used to fit the absorbance variations at

Study of the temperature dependence of the redox potential
Substantial differences between the potentials of heroes belonging to different cytochromes or even to the same cytochrome are sometimes observed, and it is of interest to identify the origin of these redox inequivalences. The factors expected to govern the value of the redox potential of a given heme can be classified according to three approximately independent contributions: i) factors related to the structure of the heine, like the existence of a thioether linkage, or the nature and orientation of the axial ligands; ii) factors related to the interaction of the heme with other protein groups, like the existence of hydrogen bonds between the N~ of the histidine ligands and backbone carbonyl or side chain oxygens, or the presence of nearby charged groups; and iii) the accessibility of the heine to the solvent. The importance of these different contributions can be assessed by theoretical free energy calculations [53, 541. This requires the knowledge of the high resolution structure and of the charge

each temperature. The ei values given by this procedure are reported as a function of temperature in figure 4. From these data, we can deduce the entropy dei variations (ASRc)~ = (S,d-So0, = 3 , and the enthalpy dT variations (AH)i adjusted to the NHE scale (table liD. Although the two sets of interaction potentials (A) and (B) give rise to different values of ei (fig 4), they lead to very similar thermodynamic parameters (table III). The reduction of the redox sites 2, 3, 4 is accompanied by a weak or slightly negative entropy variation and a small value of AH. The thermodynamic characteristics of site 1 are very different: the very negative ASac variation leads to the crossing of et and (ea,e3) at about 50°C and 30°C in case (A) and (B), respectively (fig 4). This large entropy stabilization of the oxidized state of site 1 is more than compensated by a large negative value of AH, which gives to this site the less negative potential at low temperature. These cancellation effects illustrate the complexity of the phenomena that determine the value of the redox potential in these proteins. It is interesting to compare these results to those reported for other proteins. Negative values of ASRc have been measured for different electron transfer metalloproteins, including hemoproteins, blue copper proteins, and iron-sulfur proteins [14]. These negative variations are generally attributed to a reduction of the degrees of freedom of the solvent system. For example, in the case of the blue proteins, it has been proposed that the full neutralization of the copper center that occurs upon reduction might lead to the formation of cages of structured water, and that this effect should be all the more important when the copper center environment is

532 more hydrophobic [56]. The same exph~aation may be given in the case of mitochondnal cytochrome c, for which ASRc values have been measured in the range - 5 0 to -95 JK -~ mol -~ 1t4]. In fact, this proposal is not supported by a recent study in which Phe 82 was substituted with a Ser residue [571. This substitution led to a large decrease in the hydrophobicity of the heme domain which, according to the previous proposal, should have resulted in a less negative ASRc value giving a more positive potential. However, a negative shift o f - 5 0 mV was observed [57]. Unfortunately, ASRc and AH have not been measured for the mutant protein. Although the entropy variations reported in table III are expected to depend on the solvent accessibility of the heine groups, their interpretation is complicated by the fact that the two methods that have been used to evaluate this acces.-;ibility in D vulgaris Miyazaki cytochrome c3 give different ordering: H2>H:-H3>H4 [2] and H2>H4~H~>H3 [4]. In addition, the accessibility varies weakly from one heme to another, and other factors may contribute to the ASRc values. Further studies on monoheme and tetraheme cytochromes are then needed before the large variations apparent in table III are correctly interpreted. The two proteins can associate to form a bimolecu!ar complex in which they can exchange electrons [46]. According to microcalorimetric and pH-stat titration experiments, the formation constant of the complex built from the two oxidized proteins depends on both pH and ionic strength, and can be estimated to be 106 M -! in the conditions of the stopped flow experiments (pH = 7.0, ionic strength 100 mM) [59]. The redox potentials of cytochrome c~ are not modified by the complexation [46]. Graphic modelisation studies [441 and peptide mapping of the cross-linked complex between ferredoxin I and cytochrome c~ [45] both suggest that Ha is well placed in the complex to exchange electrons with the [4Fe--4S] center. This information can be used to build a kinetic model that retains the essential physics of the system (fig 5). In this model, the ferredoxin is represented by a molecule possessing a center with a redox potential equal to -375 mV, whereas the cytochrome is represented by a molecule containing a high potential heme h~ with a redox potential equal to -150 mV, and a low potential heme h2 with a redox potential equal to -330 mV, the average of the three more negative potentials of cytochrome c3. By varying the redox states of the three centers, two ferredoxin species, four cytochromes species and eight complexed species can be defined. The formation and dissociation of the complexed species is governed by the kinetic constants kl and k_l, respectively (fig 5a). The electron exchange between the two proteins takes place in a transient complex via a specific heme which may be either h, (fig 5b) or ht (fig 5c). This step is described by k2 and k_2. Finally, the intramolecular electron transfer between ht and h2 is described by k3 and k_3. In order to limit the number of adjustable parameters in the model, all kinetic constants are assumed independent of the redox state of the centers. A scheme representing all the kinetic steps of the model is given in the Appendix. Since the ratios k2/k_2 and kJk_3 are fixed by the values of the redox potentials, the four independent parameters can be taken as kt, k_t, k2, k3. The set of differential equations relating the concentations of the 14 species was integrated numerically by using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method described in Materials and methods, for reactions (A) and (B): cyt(ox) + fd(red) ~ cyt(red) + fd(ox) (A) fd(ox) + cyt(red) ~ fd(red) + cyt(ox) (B) The initial conditions were those used in the stopped flow experiments: [cyt] = 0.25 IaM, [fd] = 0 to 4/aM [6]. Fol" any value of the initial concentration, the quantities followed in the stopped flow experiments, namely the total concentration of the reduced hemes

A kinetic model to describe the electron exchange between cytochrome c3 and its redox partners
Cytochrome c3 is an obligatory intermediate in the electron exchange between hydrogenase and ferredoxins or flavodoxins. Among the few studies that have been devoted to the electron transfer kinetics between cytochrome c3 and its redox partners, the more comprehensive one is undoubtedly that carried out by Cappeillere-Blandin et al [6] on the reversible electron exchange between cytochrome c~ and ferredoxin I from D desulfuricans Norway. In that work, the kinetics of the reduction of cytochrome c3 by ferredoxin and of the reduction of ferredoxin by cytochrome c3 were studied by stopped flow experiments for different ferredoxin concentrations. In all cases, the kinetics could be fitted by a single exponential curve characterized by an apparent first order constant kob,. The variations of kob, as a function of the ferredoxin concentration were analyzed through simple models ...;n u,h;ch.. ,ho,.,. u,.,~,~,t'~:¢~ hemes were not expiiciteiy ., ..... considered [6]. Actually, we show in this section that this set of data is sufficiently rich th ~t it can be fitted by more realistic models. We first .ecall the known properties of this electron transfer system: Ferredoxin i possesses a unique [4Fe-4S] center per subunit, with Em= -375 + 15 mV [58], while cytochrome c3 contains a high potential center with e~ = -150 mV and three low potential centers with e2 = -300 mV, e3 = -330 mV, e4 = -350 r~aV [331.

533 106 M -l, in excellent agreement with the results of the microcalorimetric experiments [59]. A significantly better fit was achieved by taking different values of k_t for the two reactions, equal to 3 x 103 s -l and 8 x 103 s -! for (A) and (B), respectively (fig 7A, B). This suggests that the association constant of the complexed species may depend slightly on the redox states of the centers. The kinetics was not sensitive to the value of k3 as far as it was larger than 103 s-l. In contrast, when the heine exchanging the electrons with the ferredoxin was the ~ potential heme (fig 5c), markedly non-exponential kinetics were

The two situations depicted in figure 5b, c gave very different results. W h e n the heine exchanging the electrons with the ferredoxin was the low potential heme (fig 5b), the kinetics were essentially exponential for any value of the initial concentrations and any reasonable value of the parameters. An example of kinetics observed for reaction (A) is represented in figure 6a, showing that the two hemes reduce synchronously. A systematic search showed that the stopped flow data for reactions (A) and (B) could be reproduced by using the set of parameters: k~ = 4 x 109 M -l s -l, k_t = 4 x 103 S- l , k~ = 780 + 50 s -~.

observed for reaction (A) tbr any value of the initial concentration and of the parameters. This is illustrated in figure 6b. This behaviour is easily understood: the fast reduction of the high potential heine h~ is followed by the much slower reduction of the low potential heme h,, which must takes place via h~ and is not favored thermodynamically. This behavior is not consistent with the results of the stopped flow experiments in which exponential kinetics were systematically observed [61. Therefore, the application of the kinetic model to the electron exchange between cytochrome c3 and ferredoxin I provides a strong argument in favour of the heme exchanging clectrons with ferredoxin being a low potential heme. The same conclusion was reached in [61 on the basis of semiquantitative arguments. This result is fully consistent with H4 playing this important role, since we have shown in the second section that both single crystal EPR experiments [17] and a recent NMR study [50] have clearly established that the high potential heme is H3 in D desulfuricans Norway cytochrome c3.

Conclusion
The elucidation of the role of the different hemes in the electron exchange between cytochrome c3 and its redox partners requires the application of several complementary approaches. We have seen that the measurement of the individual redox potentials could be achieved by resorting to EPR and NMR spectroscopies, which are sensitive to the differences between the magnetic properties of the hemes. The assignment of these potentials to the hemes defined in the threedimensional structure represents a methodological challenge. In our opinion, a clear-cut attribution is possible only when the individual potentials are well separated one from another, a situation which is rarely observed in this class of cytochromes. Even in this situation, elaborate techniques based on detailed magneto-structural relations are needed. AlthougL magnetic spectroscopies play a fundamental role in the definition of the redox characteristics of each heme, we have shown in the last two sections that a

535 detailed analysis of the data obtained through the more conventional UV-visible absorption spectroscopy can also bring very useful information about the redox properties and the role of each heme. However, further studies are required before a definitive answer is given to this simple question: are the four hemes needed for the electron exchange between cytochrome c3 and its redox partners?
