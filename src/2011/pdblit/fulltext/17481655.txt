Stabilization of the Cold Shock Protein CspB from Bacillus subtilis by Evolutionary Optimization of Coulombic Interactions
Michael Wunderlich, Andreas Martin and Franz X. Schmid*
¨ Laboratorium fur Biochemie ¨ und Bayreuther Zentrum fur Molekulare Biowissenschaften ¨ Universitat Bayreuth, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany The bacterial cold shock proteins (Csp) are used by both experimentalists and theoreticians as model systems for analyzing the Coulombic contributions to protein stability. We employ Proside, a method of directed evolution, to identify stabilized variants of Bs-CspB from Bacillus subtilis. Proside links the increased protease resistance of stabilized protein variants to the infectivity of a filamentous phage. Here, three cspB libraries were used for in vitro selections to explore the stabilizing potential of charged amino acids in Bs-CspB. In the first library codons for nine selected surface residues were partially randomized, in the second one random mutations were introduced non-specifically by error-prone PCR, and in the third one the spontaneous mutation rate of the phage in Escherichia coli was used. Stabilizing mutations were found at the surface positions 1, 3, 46, 48, 65, and 66. The contributions of these mutations to stability were characterized by analyzing them individually and in combination. The best combination (M1R, E3K, K65I, and E66L) increased the midpoint of thermal unfolding of Bs-CspB from 53.8 to 85.0 8C. The effects of most mutations are strongly context dependent. A good example is provided by the E3R mutation. It is strongly stabilizing (DDGDZ11.1 kJ molK1) in the wild-type protein, but destabilizing (DDGDZK4.0 kJ molK1) in the A46K/S48R/E66L variant. The stabilizations by charge mutations did not correlate well with the corresponding changes in the protein net charge, and they could not be ascribed to the formation of ion pairs. Previous theoretical analyses did not identify the stabilization caused by the mutations at positions 1, 46, and 48. Also, electrostatics calculations based on protein net charge or charge asymmetry did not predict well the stability changes that occur when charged residues in Bs-CspB are mutated. It remains a challenge to model the Coulombic interactions of charged residues in a protein and to determine their contributions to the Gibbs free energy of protein folding.

For a long time it was unclear whether Coulombic interactions contribute to the thermodynamic stability of folded proteins. At the protein surface interactions between charged residues are weak, because the dielectric constant 3 of water is high. In the protein interior 3 is low, and thus Coulombic interactions are strong, but possibly not strong enough to counteract the high enthalpic cost for the desolvation of the charged amino acid side-chains.1 Indeed, buried salt bridges are rarely found in folded proteins, and the stability of the Arc repressor for instance could be improved greatly

1064 by replacing charged residues in the interior of this protein with hydrophobic residues.2 Engineered salt bridges at the surface of T4 lysozyme were not stabilizing,3 but a partially buried natural Asp-His salt bridge stabilized T4 lysozyme by about 16 kJ molK1.4 Surface salt bridges can thus be stabilizing, but their contributions are highly context-dependent.5 In human lysozyme the extent of stabilization by salt bridges correlates with their accessibility.6 Proteins from thermophilic organisms ("thermophilic" proteins) usually carry more charged residues at their surfaces than their homologs from mesophilic organisms ("mesophilic" proteins). This finding renewed the interest in ion pairs or salt bridges at the protein surface. Initial attempts to identify stabilizing pair-wise Coulombic interactions by mutagenesis and to graft them onto mesophilic proteins, were, however, generally without success. The surface charges in thermophilic proteins are apparently arranged as ion networks rather than as isolated ion pairs. Regarding the long-range nature of Coulombic interactions and the high mobility of charged groups at the protein surface, this finding is expected and supported by mutational and theoretical analyses.7­18 The bacterial cold shock proteins (Csp) provide simple systems for investigating the role of Coulombic interactions for protein stability. These proteins consist of 65­70 residues, which are arranged in a five-stranded antiparallel b-sheet structure (Figure 1).19 They are found in mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria. CspB from the mesophile Bacillus subtilis (Bs-CspB) and Csp from the thermophile Bacillus caldolyticus (Bc-Csp) differ in sequence at 12 surface-exposed positions, but only two of them, Arg3 and Leu66 of Bc-Csp (which replace Glu3 and Glu66 of Bs-CspB), are responsible for the large difference in stability (15.8 kJ molK1) between the two proteins.20,21 The potential of surface residues for stabilizing

Stabilization of CspB by Optimized Coulombic Interactions

the mesophilic protein Bs-CspB was also investigated by using Proside, a method of in vitro evolution. Proside links the increased protease resistance of stabilized protein variants to the infectivity of a filamentous phage.22 In previous experiments six of the positions at which Bs-CspB differs from Bc-Csp were randomized by saturation mutagenesis, the corresponding library of gene sequences was inserted into gene 3 of the phage fd and stabilized variants of Bs-CspB were selected by Proside.23,24 In this selection many strongly stabilized variants were found, and the best one was as stable as Tm-Csp, the homolog from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima. The simplicity of the cold shock proteins and the large set of experimental stability data prompted a number of theoretical analyses.15,25­29 All of them identified Glu3 and Glu66 in Bs-CspB as destabilizing. Dominy et al.25 were able to reproduce the differences in the salt dependence of the stability between the mesophilic and the thermophilic protein. Zhou concluded from electrostatics calculations that the contributions of charged residues to Csp stability are governed, among others, by the protein net charge.26 In our previous Proside selection we used libraries with randomized codons for positions at which Bs-CspB differs from its thermophilic counterpart Bc-Csp. This time libraries were employed in which other surface residues were targeted, either in a site-specific fashion by randomizing nine selected codons, or in a site-unspecific fashion by introducing random mutations into the cspB gene by error-prone PCR or by using the spontaneous mutation rate of the phage. Many stabilized variants were identified. They were overexpressed, purified and their stabilities measured. These data were then used to characterize global and local effects on charge­charge interactions and to evaluate existing electrostatics calculations. They might also be useful for benchmarking future theoretical analyses of the Coulombic contributions to protein stability.

Results
Proside selections In our previous Proside selections for stabilized Bs-CspB variants we used a library of cspB genes with six randomized triplets, which coded for the residues 2, 3, 46, 64, 66, and 67. At these surfaceexposed positions Bs-CspB differs from its thermophilic homolog Bc-Csp. Now we targeted nine other surface residues (5, 10, 12, 19, 20, 22, 43, 46 and 48) for randomization. The positions were selected because they are remote from the binding site for nucleic acids and occupied by polar or charged residues in the homologs of Bs-CspB from thermophilic bacteria. The respective codons were replaced by degenerate triplets that code for at least a positively and a negatively

charged, a non-polar and a polar amino acid (see Materials and Methods). In the selection rounds the corresponding phage library was first exposed to 2.5 mM chymotrypsin (for 15 minutes at 57.5 8C) and then to 1.8 mM trypsin (for 15 minutes at 45 8C). The proteolysis by trypsin eliminated chymotrypsinresistant recombinant phage with shortened Bs-CspB inserts. Recombinant phage were additionally removed by amplifying the pool of Bs-CspB genes from the phage library by PCR after selection rounds 2, 3, 5 and 6. The fragments with full-length

genes were then re-inserted into the phage. To increase the selection pressure we doubled the trypsin concentration after selection round 4 and the chymotrypsin concentration after round 6. Two colonies were selected for sequencing of the cspB gene after the fourth round and 13 colonies after the seventh round (Table 1). Eight different sequences were found. All mutated residues were in the carboxyterminal half of the molecule; the amino-terminal half showed the sequence of the wild-type protein.

Error-prone PCR/ spontaneous mutations

Site-directed mutations

TM is the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition; DHD is the enthalpy of unfolding at TM. DDGD is the change in Gibbs free energy of unfolding at 70 8C relative to the wild-type protein. DDGD at 0 M NaCl is the total change, DDGD at 2 M NaCl represents the non-polar contribution, and the difference between 0 M and 2 M NaCl represents the Coulombic contribution to DDGD. The thermodynamic parameters were derived from thermal unfolding transitions as shown in Figure 2.

1066 The corresponding wild-type DNA sequence might have been introduced during library formation by proof reading and recombination. Sequencing of the library before the selection showed, however, that the codons for positions 5, 10, 12, 19, 20, and 22 were indeed degenerate. An additional library was created in which only the amino-terminal residues 5, 10, 12, 19, 20 and 22 were varied. After six selection rounds again only variants with the wildtype sequence at the randomized positions were found. This suggests that mutations at these positions do not lead to a strong stabilization of the corresponding phage, and therefore they are lost in the competition with the phage hosting wildtype Bs-CspB. Five of the eight selected variants were overexpressed and purified. They all are strongly stabilized and their TM values are about 16 deg. C higher than the TM value of the wild-type protein (Table 2). The thermal transition of the E43G/ A46K/S48R variant is shown in Figure 2 in comparison with Bs-CspB. In all variants, positions 46 and 48 are occupied by positively charged residues, and the variant with substitutions only at these two positions (A46K/S48R) is stabilized by 11.1 kJ mol K1 relative to wild-type Bs-CspB (Table 2). All Tables list Gibbs free energies of denaturation (DGD). An increase in stability is thus represented by a positive DDGD value and a decrease by a negative value. To analyze the individual contributions to stability, the mutations A46K and S48R were introduced separately into wild-type Bs-CspB by directed mutagenesis. They increased the DGD value by 5.9 and 6.6 kJ mol K1, respectively (Table 2), which indicates that the stabilizing contributions of Lys46 and Arg48 are almost additive and similar in magnitude. The various

Stabilization of CspB by Optimized Coulombic Interactions

amino acid residues found at position 43 are apparently unimportant for stability. In the next two Proside experiments mutations were introduced into the cspB gene in a siteindependent fashion by error-prone PCR or by using the spontaneous mutation rate of the phage during its propagation in E. coli. The resulting two phage libraries were again exposed to rounds of chymotryptic and tryptic cleavage, and recombinant phage was eliminated as described above. After five and six rounds, respectively, clones were picked and sequenced. The results of these selections are shown in Table 3. Most variants contained single mutations, but two double mutations were found as well. All mutated residues locate to the protein surface. Mutations occurred also in triplets that code for residues in the protein core, but all of them were silent and did not change the amino acid sequence. Apparently, the core of Bs-CspB is well packed and cannot be improved easily by mutagenesis. Several variants were overexpressed, purified, and their stabilities determined (Table 2). The mutations E3K and E66K are both strongly stabilizing (the DDGD values are 11.5 and 9.1 kJ molK1, respectively; Table 2). This confirms the high stabilizing potential at these two positions, which was already apparent in the comparison between mesophilic and thermophilic cold shock proteins.20 One of the selected variants (N55S/Q59R; Table 3) was less stable than wild-type Bs-CspB. We cannot offer a simple explanation for this. It is possible that, as a guest protein in the gene 3 protein, this variant improves the infectivity of the phage. All the other selected variants increased the TM value by more than 8 deg. C (Table 2). The M1R and K65I mutations stabilize the protein by 7.3 and 6.4 kJ molK1, respectively (Table 2). The strong stabilization by K65I seems surprising, because this mutation increases the net charge of Bs-CspB from K6 to K7. However, the stability of the K65I variant shows the same dependence on NaCl as wild-type Bs-CspB (Figure 3), which indicates that the stabilization caused by this mutation originates from improved non-polar

1067 bacterium Thermotoga maritima.30 The DDGD value of this triple variant shows the same dependence on NaCl concentration as Bc-Csp, the homolog from B. caldolyticus (Figure 3). This indicates that a part of the strong stabilization of this variant originates from improved Coulombic interactions. The stability could be further increased by combining these three mutations with E66L, a mutation that was found in our previous Proside selections with Bs-CspB.23 The resulting quadruple mutant M1R/ E3K/K65I/E66L showed a TM value of 85.0 8C (Table 2). A strongly stabilized protein was also obtained by combining only two mutations, M1R and E3K (DDGDZ16.3 kJ molK1; Table 2). This variant shows the strongest stabilization by Coulombic effects, as indicated by the salt dependence of its DDGD value (Figure 3). The K65I mutation leaves the Coulombic interactions unchanged when introduced into the wild-type protein (net charge K6; see the two top curves in Figure 3). When introduced into the M1R/ E3K variant (net charge K3), however, it provides an unfavorable Coulombic contribution (see the two bottom curves in Figure 3). It will be interesting to see whether electrostatics calculations can reproduce this difference. Other combinations were less favorable. The M1R/E66K double mutant, in particular, is only 1.9 kJ molK1 more stable than the single E66K variant, although, in the wild-type protein, the M1R mutation stabilizes by 7.3 kJ molK1 (Table 2). ° The Cb atoms of residues 1 and 66 are 8.9 A apart, and they point towards each other (Figure 1). Therefore, the positively charged side-chains of Arg1 and Lys66 are probably close to each other in the M1R/E66K variant. The individual mutations E3K and E66K are both strongly stabilizing (the DDG D values are 11.5 kJ molK1 and 9.1 kJ molK1, respectively). The double mutation E3K/E66K, however, increases DGD by only 8.0 kJ molK1, and is thus less stabilizing than either single mutation. The Cb atoms of ° residues 3 and 66 are only 6.5 A apart, and they also point towards each other. (Figure 1). Similarly, the sum of the stabilizations caused by the three individual mutations M1R, E3K and E66K is 27.9 kJ molK1, whereas the triple mutant with all three mutations combined is stabilized by only 6.5 kJ molK1. A formal triple-mutant analysis17 yields unfavorable interaction free energies of K13.5 kJ molK1 between Lys3 and Lys66 (in the presence of Arg1), of K6.3 kJ molK1 between Arg1 and Lys66 (in the presence of Lys3) and of K3.4 kJ molK1 between Arg1 and Lys3 (in the presence of Lys66). These values scale roughly with the distances between these residues (Figure 1). They cannot be interpreted in terms of pair-wise destabilizing interactions between the amino acid residues at positions 1, 3 and 66, but they confirm our previous finding that the repulsion of like charges can provide very large unfavorable contributions to DGD. This analysis reveals also that the protein variant with Lys residues at positions 3 and

interactions of Ile65 in the variant and not from the loss of unfavorable Coulombic interactions of Lys65 in the wild-type protein. Together, the new selections (Tables 1 and 3) identified four additional positions at the surface of Bs-CspB (1, 46, 48 and 65) at which significant stabilization could be achieved. In three cases the stability was increased by the exchange of an uncharged for a positively charged residue, which reduced the net negative charge from K6 to K5. It should be noted that in libraries created by random mutagenesis, Proside can identify only phage that host strongly stabilized variants of Bs-CspB. Only these phage can compete successfully in the selections against the vast excess of phage that carry wild-type Bs-CspB as a guest. Analysis of stability increments by site-directed mutagenesis To examine whether the contributions to DGD are additive, we combined the four mutations from the site-unspecific selections in a quadruple mutant (M1R/E3K/K65I/E66K). The TM value of this variant is increased by 10.9 deg. C only (Figure 2), which is equivalent to a DDGD value of 14.1 kJ molK1, relative to the wildtype protein. This is much less than the sum of the contributions of the individual substitutions, which amounts to 34.4 kJ molK1 (Table 2). The positions 1, 3, 65 and 66 are near each other in the folded protein (Figure 1), which explains the non-additivity. To analyze this strong interdependence and to find good subsets of stabilizing residues, the four mutations were combined in various ways (Table 2). The highest stability was reached for the triple mutant M1R/E3K/K65I. With a TM value of 83.7 8C (Figure 2) and a DDGD value of 20.9 kJ molK1 (Table 2) it is more stable than the homologous cold shock protein from the hyperthermophilic

For all proteins, the melting temperature, TM, and the enthalpy of unfolding at TM,DHD (TM), are shown. The change in DGD at 70 8C relative to the wild-type protein, DDGD, is given in the absence and in the presence of 2 M NaCl. DDGD at 0 M NaCl is the total change, DDGD at 2 M NaCl represents the non-polar contribution, and the difference between 0 M and 2 M NaCl represents the Coulombic contribution to DDGD. The thermodynamic parameters were derived from thermal unfolding transitions as shown in Figure 2.

66 is 8.0 kJ molK1 more stable than the wild-type protein, which has Glu residues at these positions (Table 2). Possibly, the two Lys residues interact more favorably with the rest of the protein, which shows a net charge of K4, or a pair of Lys residues with their long side-chains can avoid

electrostatic repulsion more easily than a pair of Glu residues. The positions 1, 3, 46, 48, and 66 are close to each other on the surface of Bs-CspB (Figure 1). In the wild-type protein the negative charge density is high in this region, because positions 3 and 66 are

occupied by Glu residues. A large panel of mutants reduced the net charge in this area by 1 (M1R, E3L, E3V, A46K, S48K, S48R, E66V and E66L), and all of them led to similar stabilizations between 5.9 and 8.8 kJ molK1 (Table 4). This suggests that a reduction of the local charge density indeed increases the stability, and that the precise location of the charge change is unimportant. The stability data for Bs-CspB from this and previous work are collected in Table 4.23,24 Together with the data on Bc-Csp20,21 they provide a basis for answering questions about the role of charged groups for the stability of the cold shock proteins, and for evaluating electrostatics calculations. An experimental measure for Coulombic interactions In our previous work we used the change in stability between 0 M and 2 M NaCl as a measure for the change in Coulombic contributions caused by a particular mutation. However, non-Coulombic contributions of a mutation (such as Hofmeister or hydrophobic effects) might also contribute to the differential salt dependence. To evaluate this possibility, we compared stability data for variants of Bs-CspB (Table 4) and of Bc-Csp,20,21 in which uncharged residues are replaced by other uncharged residues. Their DDGD values show the same salt dependence (G0.3 kJ molK1, in 0­2 M NaCl) as the corresponding wild-type proteins. This indicates that non-Coulombic effects of amino acid substitutions do not influence the salt dependence of stability. We therefore continue to use the difference in stability between 0 M and 2 M NaCl as a measure for the differences in the Coulombic interactions that are caused by a mutation. It provides a lower bound, because some Coulombic interactions are not screened completely by 2 M NaCl, in particular when the charged groups are very close to each other.25,26,31­35 Correlation between stability and net charge In principle, the stability of a protein is expected to increase when the net charge is reduced; this is confirmed by Figure 4. It shows that the changes in the total Gibbs free energy (the DDGD values at 0 M NaCl) and in the Coulombic contribution (the DDGD value that changes between 0 M and 2 M NaCl) indeed depend on the net charge. The residual DDGD value that persists at 2 M NaCl also depends on net charge, albeit with a large scatter of the data. Most of our mutants result from selections for stabilized variants, and therefore the stabilities also depend on the number of mutations (Figure 4(d)). At first glance, this might suggest that the correlation of stability with net charge in Figure 4(a) is meaningless. In fact, the good correlation between (a), (b) and (d) of Figure 4 indicates that in our Proside rounds mostly variants were selected that decreased the net charge, although there was no bias for this in the libraries. No variants were found that increased the net charge and, at the same time, increased the electrostatic contribution to stability. K65I was the only mutation that increased both net charge and stability. Its contribution to stability is, however, not of Coulombic origin (Figure 3 and Table 2). The protein variants with a net charge smaller than K3 carry multiple mutations of charged residues, and most of them were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to analyze the interdependence between the mutations that were found in the selections. For these variants the correlation between net charge and stability breaks down (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The DDGD values that persist at 2 M NaCl (Figure 4(c)) are also dependent on net charge.

The DDGD values are taken from Table 3.

1070 Again, since most of the variants resulted from a selection for improved stability, we see a very similar correlation when the DDGD values at 2 M NaCl are plotted as a function of the number of

mutations (results not shown). Probably, the correlation seen in Figure 4(c) originates from residual Coulombic interactions that are not screened by 2 M NaCl.

Table 5. Dependence on background charge of five mutations

The first entry in every panel represents the residues present in the wild-type protein. The DTM and DDGD values give the stability differences caused by the mutation in the corresponding background, they are calculated from the data in Table 4. DDGD at 0 M NaCl is the total change, DDGD at 2 M NaCl represents the non-polar contribution, and the difference between 0 M and 2 M NaCl represents the Coulombic contribution to DDGD. Negatively charged residues are colored red, positively charged residues are colored blue. In the ribbon diagrams the position of the mutation is marked by a thick circle, the numbers at the connecting lines give the distance between ° the Cb atoms of the corresponding residues in A.

1071 respectively, and, when both mutations are present, the M1R mutation destabilizes the protein because the Coulombic contribution is now unfavorable (K2.7 kJ molK1). The strongest dependence on the background is found for the E3R mutation (Table 5E). This replacement occurs naturally and provides the major contribution to the strongly increased stability of Bc-Csp.20 In wild-type Bs-CspB (net charge K6) the E3R mutation increased the stability twofold (DDGDZ11.1 kJ molK1), predominantly by a favorable Coulombic contribution of 7.9 kJ molK1 (Table 5D). This contribution was strongly reduced (to 4.2 kJ molK1 or 4.3 kJ molK1, respectively) when the negative charge at position 66 was removed by the E66L mutation or when two positive charges were introduced by the A46K and S48K mutations. In the presence of all three mutations the E3R substitution is destabilizing, and its Coulombic contribution becomes unfavorable (DDGDZK2.5 kJ molK1). The same mutation (E3R) thus leads to an increase in TM value by 16 deg. C in one background (the wild-type protein) and to a decrease by 6.2 deg. C in another (the A46K/S48K/ E66L variant). This is equivalent to a change in DDGD of 15.1 kJ molK1, which is higher than the total DGD of wild-type Bs-CspB (11.3 kJ molK1 at pH 7.0, 25 8C).36 Most of this strong dependence on the background is provided by the Coulombic contribution to DDGD , which decreases from 7.9 kJ molK1 to K2.5 kJ molK1 (Table 5E). Effect of the local charge on stability The results in Table 5 indicate that local charge variations rather than the net charge determine protein stability. This is particularly evident for the region that encompasses positions 3, 46, 48, 64, and 66 (Figure 1). To examine the dependence of stability on the local charge in this area, we compared five variants that show a local charge of zero in this area but differ in the positions of the charges (Table 6A). In this series of proteins a remarkably consistent picture emerges. All these variants are strongly stabilized relative to the wildtype protein, which shows a local charge of K2. The variant with uncharged side-chains at all five positions is stabilized by 13.2 kJ molK1 relative to the wild-type protein. The three variants that show one positively and one negatively charged residue are stabilized by 10.5­11.1 kJ molK1, independent of the location of the two charges, and the variant with two positive and two negative residues shows a DDGD value of 11.1 kJ molK1. If a charge of zero in this confined area results in highest stabilization, we would expect that the stability drops again when it is further changed to C1 or C2. This was accomplished by combining two or three positively charged residues, respectively, with one negatively charged residue (Table 6B and C). These variants are even more stable than those with a local charge of zero. The respective stabilities of the variants with local charges of C1

Context dependence of particular mutations In the following we use the stability data compiled in Table 4 to examine how the contribution to stability of a particular mutation is modulated by changes in charge in its environment. First we consider the mutations E43S, E3V and E66L, in which negative charges are removed by mutation. Data for the E43S mutation in different variants are shown in Table 5A. This mutation reduces the net charge from K6 to K5 in the wildtype protein and from K4 to K3 in the A46K/S48R and A46K/S48K variants. Ser43 is remote from both ° positions 46 and 48 with Cb­Cb distances of 12.7 A ° and 18.6 A, respectively. The Coulombic contributions to stability of the E43S mutation are small in all three cases (0.8, 0.5, and 1.7 kJ molK1, respectively), which suggests that Coulombic interactions are hardly affected by changes in charge at remote sites. It agrees with results and calculations obtained for staphylococcal nuclease.31 The E3V mutation (Table 5B) also removes a negative charge and thus reduces the net charge from K6 to K5. It increases the Coulombic free energy by 4.6 kJ molK1. This value is decreased to 3.1 kJ molK1 or 3.8 kJ mol K1, when the E3V mutation is introduced into molecules that already contain the E66V or the T64R mutations, respectively. When both mutations E66V and T64R are present in the background, the E3V mutation is stabilized by 3.1 kJ molK1. The distances from ° position 3 to positions 64 and 66 are 10.0 A and ° , respectively (Cb­Cb). Together, this indicates 6.6 A that the Coulombic stabilization by the E3V mutation is slightly decreased when the negative charge density in its environment is reduced by mutation. The effect of the E66L mutation depends strongly on the background (Table 5C). In the wild-type protein it is stabilizing (DDGDZ8.8 kJ molK1) with a favorable Coulombic contribution of 2.8 kJ molK1. This contribution is reduced to 1.1 kJ molK1 in the A46K/S48R variant and to K0.9 kJ molK1 in the E3R variant. In the presence of all three mutations, the E66L mutation is destabilizing (DDGDZK2.4 kJ molK1) because the Coulombic contributions are now highly unfavorable (DDGDZK4.5 kJ molK1). Thus, the E66L mutation increases the TM value by 12.8 deg. C when introduced into the wild-type protein, but decreases the it by 3.7 deg. C when introduced into the E3R/ A46K/S48R variant. This behavior cannot be explained by the change in net charge, which is negative for all variants. Clearly, strong electrostatic interactions between adjacent charges dominate. The mutated positions are close to each other, and the Cb­Cb distances from position 3 to the positions ° 46, 48, and 66 are only 4.5, 4.8, and 6.6 A, respectively. The M1R mutation introduces a positive charge and thus also reduces the net charge from K6 to K5. It stabilizes Bs-CspB by 7.3 kJ molK1 (Table 5D) with a favorable Coulombic contribution of 3.9 kJ molK1. This value decreases to 2.0 kJ molK1 or 1.2 kJ molK1 in the E3K and E66K variants,

The local charge refers to the surface area encompassing the positions 3, 46, 48, 64 and 66. The DTM and DDGD values are taken from Table 4. The DDGD values are explained in the legend to Table 4. Negatively charged residues are colored red, positively charged residues are colored blue.

and C2 are 15.7 kJ molK1 and 14.1 kJ molK1 higher than the stability of the wild-type protein. The variant with a local charge of C3 shows a similar stability as the variants with a local charge of zero (Table 6D). Local charge is thus also not a sufficient predictor for stability. Electrostatic calculations should reveal how interactions of the charged residues at positions 3, 46, 48, and 66 with charged residues outside this area contribute to the experimentally measured changes in stability.

Discussion
The in vitro selection of stabilized protein variants We use Proside to select stabilized proteins from libraries of variants. This technique relies on the assumption that the thermodynamic stability of an

isolated protein correlates well with the proteolytic stability of a phage fd variant that hosts this protein in its gene 3 protein. Almost all selected variants of Bs-CspB showed strongly increased TM values, which suggest that this basic assumption is valid. In the previous work with Bs-CspB we had randomized surface positions at which this protein differs from a thermophilic homolog23 and identified four strongly stabilizing mutations.24 Here, we used libraries that were created either by sitespecific randomization of other surface residues or by site-unspecific mutations. In these experiments four additional positions with a high potential for stabilization were discovered. In the protein interior no stabilizing amino acid substitutions were found, although several silent mutations occurred at core positions. This confirms that the protein interior is well packed and not easily improved by single mutations. In Proside the repertoire of genes that code for the

1073 Bs-CspB. For the A46E mutation the calculated value of K3.3 kJ molK1 agrees reasonably well with the previously published experimental value of K2.5 kJ mol K1 21 . For the A46K mutation they predicted a destabilization by K7.5 kJ mol K1, whereas here we measured a stabilization by C5.9 kJ molK1. Because of this strong stabilization the A46K mutation was repeatedly found in the Proside selections. Sanchez-Ruiz & Makhatadze15 used a Tanford­ Kirkwood model to calculate the energy of charge­ charge interactions of the individual charged residues of wild-type Bs-CspB. The calculated values and the experimental data (for the mutations to Ala) show the same sign for positions 3, 5, 7, and 66. For Lys13 these authors predicted a small stabilization by Coulombic interactions, but the analysis of the K13A mutation (in the E3L variant;39 Table 4) suggests that Lys13 is slightly destabilizing. The distance between Lys13 and Glu3 is more than ° 20 A, and therefore the two mutations are independent of each other. A more pronounced discrepancy is noted at position 65. For Lys65 a strongly favorable Coulombic energy was calculated. However, Lys65 is apparently unfavorable, and the K65I mutation strongly stabilizes Bs-CspB (Table 2). Dominy et al. calculated the electrostatic free energy of Bs-CspB folding and its salt dependence by finite difference Poisson­Boltzmann calculations.25 Here, we also note a qualitative agreement between the calculated and the experimental values for positions 3, 5, 7, 12, 19 and 66. Again, discrepancies exist for Lys13 and Lys65. As in the calculations by Sanchez-Ruiz & Makhatadze,15 these residues are found to be electrostatically stabilizing. Apparently it is hard to predict stabilizations that are caused by mutations that increase the protein net charge. Garofoli et al.27 employed molecular dynamics, Zhou & Dong26 used the Poisson­Boltzmann equation to model the effects of mutations on

variants is annealed to the single-stranded phage genome carrying the wild-type cspB gene. Phages expressing the wild-type protein are thus always present in a fair number in the starting library. As a consequence, only phages with strongly stabilized variants of the guest proteins can compete against those hosting the corresponding wild-type form. This limitation holds in particular for libraries that are created by error-prone PCR or by spontaneous mutation. It explains why all the stabilizing mutations that were selected in this work (at positions 1, 3, 46, 48, 65 and 66) increase the TM value by at least 8 deg. C (Table 2). It probably also explains why no stabilizing mutations could be identified in the 5­43 region of CspB in these selections. Experimental determination of Coulombic contributions The results of all our selections highlight the large stabilizing potential of charged residues at the surface of Bs-CspB, and there is no doubt that changes in the self energies and in the Coulombic interactions of these residues contribute significantly to the observed stabilization. Coulombic interactions are screened by counter-ions, and therefore we used the differential response of protein variants to the addition of 2 M NaCl as an experimental measure to quantify Coulombic interactions. The DDGD value that persisted at 2 M NaCl was assumed to reflect non-Coulombic contributions. The DDGD values at 2 M NaCl (Table 4) still show a weak dependence on net charge. This suggests that the change in DDGD between 0 M and 2 M NaCl underestimates the Coulombic contributions, probably because some interactions are not well screened by counter-ions It has been shown that strong interactions between charged groups that are very close to each other are virtually insensitive to salt.25,26,31­34,37,38 We continue to use the DDGD value between 0 M and 2 M NaCl as the best experimental measure for the Coulombic contributions. It clearly represents a lower bound; the upper bound is set by the total DDGD value as measured at 0 M NaCl. Comparison of experimental data and free energy calculations for the cold shock proteins Torrez et al.28 used Poisson­Boltzmann electrostatics calculations to reproduce the set of our published data on the stabilities of Bs-CspB and Bc-Csp variants.21 They achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.86 between the calculated and the measured data. For the two variants of Bc-Csp that contain the destabilizing mutations R3E and L66E the calculated DDGD values (K7.1 kJ molK1 and K4.2 kJ molK1) deviate strongly from the corresponding experimental values (K20.5 kJ molK1 and K17.1 kJ molK1). Torrez et al.28 also calculated DDGD values for mutations at position 46 of

1074 the stability of the various cold shock proteins. Both groups restricted their analysis to the published experimental data and did not provide calculated stability data for the new mutants of this study. From their calculations, Zhou & Dong concluded that the total charge of the cold shock proteins determines the ionic strength dependence of the DGD values. The experimental salt dependences suggest that this might be an oversimplification. The representative salt profiles shown in Figure 3 do not scale well with net charge. The M1R/E3K/ K65I variant of Bs-CspB and the thermophilic protein Bc-Csp show identical salt profiles although they show net charges of K4 and K2, respectively, and the M1R/E3K variant of Bs-CspB (with a net charge of K3) is more strongly destabilized by 0.5 M NaCl than Bc-Csp (with a net charge of K2). This indicates that net charge might be an overly simplistic predictor for salt effects on protein stability, even for very small proteins such as the cold shock proteins. To account not only for the net charge, but also for the spatial charge distribution, Mozo-Villarias et al.40 calculated quasi-electric dipole moments between the centers of the positive and negative charge centroids of a protein variant and assumed that the stability correlates inversely with the magnitude of this dipole moment. For Bs-CspB they calculated the changes in the quasi-electric dipole moment upon mutations to a positive, a negative, or a neutral amino acid residue at every chain position. This provided an extended set of data for the comparison with our experimental results. Figure 5 correlates the calculated dipole moments with the experimental stability data (in the form of TM values) for Bs-CspB variants with single charge mutations. Overall, the correlation is rather poor, and it does not improve when the comparison is restricted to the Coulombic part of DDGD (between 0 M and 2 M NaCl).

Stabilization of CspB by Optimized Coulombic Interactions

asymmetry in the charge distribution cannot well predict how the protein stability changes when charged residues are mutated. Rather, interactions with neighboring charges dominate the consequences of a mutation for stability. Experiments and calculations with other proteins also showed that charged residues can contribute strongly to protein stability, that the strength of an interaction depends on the distance between the charged groups and that short-range interactions between oppositely charged residues are hardly screened by ions.5,10,11,13,31­33,38,41­43 Also effects of mutations on the unfolded state must be accounted for.44­46 We hope that the large set of stability data for the various cold shock proteins and their mutants in this and in previous work will provide a good experimental basis for the further development and testing of electrostatics calculations.20,21,23,24,39

Materials and Methods
Construction of phage libraries For the site-directed randomization of surface-exposed residues a library was constructed using PCR and oligonucleotides with degenerated base triplets at the positions that code for the nine amino acids to be randomized (Table 7). The theoretical diversity of this library was 1.1!107 at the protein level. The repertoire of mutated DNA fragments comprising the cspB gene were hybridized to the (C) DNA strand of phage fd hosting the wild-type cspB gene, extended to double-stranded DNA by Pfu-DNA-polymerase and used to transform E. coli XL1Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA).47 A total of 6.2!107 transformants were obtained. Error-prone PCR was used to insert mutations randomly into the cspB gene. The gene was amplified by using flanking primers in the presence of 0.25 mM Mn2C, reduced dNTP concentration (20 mM) and Taq DNApolymerase. The cspB gene was also amplified under standard PCR conditions by Taq DNA-polymerase. The resulting repertoires of PCR fragments were then introduced into phage fd as described above. Proside selections The selections were performed essentially as described.47 After two minutes in 50 ml of 100 mM potassium

Conclusions
In general, our results for the stabilized variants of the cold shock protein indicate that simplified models based on protein net charge or the global

phosphate (pH 8.0) at 57.5 8C the phage were incubated with 2.5 mM chymotrypsin for 15 minutes at 57.5 8C. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 45 8C, and incubated with 1.8 mM trypsin for 15 minutes. To propagate the surviving phage the solution was added to a growing culture of E. coli XL1Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). Protein purification and stability measurement The genes for the Bs-CspB variants were amplified by PCR with primers coding for the mutations at the gene termini (positions 1, 3, 65, 66 and 67) and including restriction sites for NdeI at the N terminus and BamHI at the C terminus. They were cloned into the plasmid pET11a (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA) and purified as described for wild-type CspB but with minor modifications.48,49 For variants with Arg at position 1 an additional ATG-codon (Met) was added in front of the gene. These variants were cloned into the plasmid pTCLE and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA) as a fusion protein with the hydrophobic TrpLE peptide.50 The fusion with the TrpLE peptide leads to the formation of cytosolic inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were purified and solubilized, and the fusion protein was cleaved as described.51 The protein was further purified as described.48 Thermal unfolding transitions of 4 mM protein were measured in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate/HCl (pH 7.0) and 0­2 M NaCl. Unfolding was followed by circular dichroism at 222.6 nm and analyzed as described.36
