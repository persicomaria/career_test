of the structure and sequence, a subfamily of small GCN5related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT)-like proteins can be defined. Proteins from this subfamily, which is largely congruent with COG2388, are characterized by a cysteine residue in the acetyl-CoA binding site near the acetyl group, by their small size in relation to other GNATs, by a lack of obvious substrate binding site, and by a distinct conformation of bound CoA in relation to other GNATs. Subfamily members are found in many bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, and in some archaeal genomes. Whereas other GNATs transfer the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA directly to an aliphatic amine, the presence of the conserved cysteine residue suggests that proteins in the COG2388 GNAT-subfamily transfer an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to one or more presently unidentified aliphatic amines via an acetyl (cysteine) enzyme intermediate. The apparent absence of a substrate-binding region suggests that the substrate is a macromolecule, such as another protein, or that a second protein subunit providing a substrate-binding region must combine with SACOL2532 to make a fully functional Nacetyl transferase.

Materials and methods Sample preparation Reagent and buffer chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Stable isotope-labeled compounds were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Genomic DNA from S. aureus (subsp. Rosenbach) was purchased from ATCC (35556). The standard protocol for protein sample preparation in NESG has been described [1]. Primers were designed using the published genome sequences of other S. aureus strains. The gene was cloned into pET21 (Novagen) to yield a protein with a C-terminal His6 tag preceded by a tworesidue cloning artifact: LEHHHHHH. Expression was achieved by growing 0.5 l E. coli BL21(DE3) cells in MJ9 medium containing 1 g U-13C-glucose and 0.5 g U-15Nammonium sulfate at 37°C to an OD of 0.75, then adding IPTG to 1 mM final concentration and the lowering the temperature to 17°C for continued growth overnight. Cells were disrupted by sonication and the clarified extract was purified by Ni-NTA affinity and gel filtration (Superdex 75) chromatography. The final yield of 6 mg pure protein was concentrated to 0.6 ml in the gel filtration buffer: 50 mM MES pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl. After addition of 5% (v/v) D2O, 240 ll quantities were put in Shigemi tubes for data collection. In addition, a U-15N and 5% biosyntheticallydirected fractionally 13C-labeled sample was generated for stereospecific assignment of isopropyl methyl groups in leucine and valine residues by growing cells as described above but with 5% of the carbon as U-13C-glucose and 95% as unenriched glucose [24]. Protein/CoA complexes were prepared by adding 10-fold molar excesses (*1­3 mg) of acetyl-CoA trilithium salt or CoA sodium salt to 240 ll 0.4 mM 5%-13C, 100%-15N or 1.0 mM U-13C, 15N samples in H2O or D2O. Titrations were performed by dissolving 1 mg CoA sodium salt in 50 ll NMR buffer and adding 1 ll quantities to 240 ll volumes of 0.25 mM U-13C, 15N protein. NMR spectroscopy NMR experiments were conducted at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland WA. All data used for calculation of the ligand-free protein was collected on a Varian Inova 600, except the HNHB, which was collected on a Varian Inova 750. Data for the protein­ligand complex was recorded on Varian Inova 600, 800, and 900 instruments. Data was collected at 20°C using standard triple-resonance pulse sequences [7, 12]. The following experiments were recorded: 1H­15NHSQC, 1H­13C-HSQC, HNCACB, CBCACONNH, HNCO, CCC-TOCSY-NNH, HCC-TOCSY-NNH, HCCH-TOCSY,

Introduction Enzymes of the GCN5-related N-Acetyl Transferase (GNAT) family catalyze the transfer of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA to an aliphatic amine [34]. Among the types of amines known to be substrates of various GNATs are lysine e-NH3 groups in histones, protein amino-termini, polyamines such as spermidine, and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Several additional families of eukaryotic Nacetyltransferases (e.g., p300/CBP, PCAF, MYST) that acetylate substrates such as histones and other proteins share certain sequence and structural similarities with GNATs [30] and are often grouped together with GNATs [11]. The archetypal GNAT superfamily [25] contains an essential core sequence motif, motif A, that is part of the acetyl-CoA binding site, and three other motifs, B, C, and D. Motifs A, B and D are present in the entire set of 140 proteins comprising the original GNAT family [25], while motif C may be missing in the histone acetyltransferases. These motifs form a common structural core called the Nacetyl transferase domain [11]. The essence of motif A is a six-residue segment R/Q­X­X­G­X­G/A, where X can be any amino acid. Structural studies of many GNAT family proteins and a few from the MYST and p300/CBP families show the essential role of motif A: structurally, this segment forms a loop flanked by a b-strand and an a-helix, and makes numerous contacts with acetyl-CoA [11]. From among the large ([4000 sequences in Pfam, PF00583) family of GNATs, we identified a functionally uncharacterized subfamily corresponding to COG2388. We determined the structure, in both CoA-bound and -free states, of a member of this subfamily from the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Sequences in this subfamily span all three kingdoms and on this basis were selected initially for structure determination [22]; the protein described in this report is target ZR31 of the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (www.nesg.org). The structure of a eukaryotic member of this subfamily has been described [33]. This subfamily is characterized by several distinguishing characteristics not found in other GNATs: smaller overall size, no motif C, an atypical motif A sequence, a distinct conformation of the bound CoA ligand, and in particular a conserved cysteine residue in the acetyl-CoA binding site that appears to be positioned for acetylation.

HCCH-COSY, 3D-15N-NOESY (100 ms mixing time), 4D-13 C­13C-HMQC-NOESY-HMQC (80 ms mixing time), two 3D-13C-NOESYs (80 ms mixing time) optimized for either aliphatic or aromatic carbons, HNHA, HNHB, and aromatic ring side chain correlation experiments (HBCBCG-CDHD/ CEHE-aro). All pulse sequences were from the BioPack library (Varian) except HCCH-TOCSY, 4D-13C­13CHMQC-NOESY-HMQC, and HBCBCG-CDHD/CEHE-aro, which were from Lewis Kay (University of Toronto). A total of 4.5 weeks of NMR time was used to collect these experiments. Amide proton exchange was monitored by acquiring 1 H­15N-HSQC spectra following dissolution of lyophilized protein in D2O. Stereospecific Leu and Val side chain assignments were obtained from a 1H­13C-HSQC experiment recorded on the 5%-13C-sample [24]. 1H­15N-HSQC and 1 H­13C-HSQC spectra were recorded for the protein/acetylCoA complex to assess which residues' cross peaks moved or disappeared as a result of ligand binding. A 3D 13C-editedfiltered NOESY-HSQC experiment [37] was collected with a mixing time of 100 ms on the U-13C, 15N-labeled sample in D2O with unlabeled acetyl-CoA bound. 2D doubly 13C-filtered 1H­1H NOESY (150 ms mixing time) and TOCSY experiments [26] were also collected with this sample, to help assign CoA resonances. To assess changes in the structure of the protein itself due to CoA binding, a 4D-13C­13C-HMQCNOESY-HMQC was collected on the sample. Resonance assignments in the bound complex were obtained from this 4D-NOESY and from HCCH-TOCSY, HNCA, and HNCOCA spectra. Chemical shift assignments for the free protein have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (Madison, WI), with accession code BMRB-5845. Data were processed with Felix (MSI) and analyzed with Felix and Sparky (http://www. cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky). Calculation of the structural ensemble NOESY cross peaks were picked using restricted peak picking in Sparky and were automatically assigned and given upper distance bounds by AutoStructure [18]. These NOE distance restraints had uniform lower bounds of ° ° 1.8 A and upper bounds of either 2.8, 3.2. 4.0 or 5.0 A. Hydrogen bond restraints were derived from amide proton D2O exchange data. Amide 1H­15N-HSQC cross peaks still present 30 min after dissolution of a lyophilized sample in ° D2O were given bounds of 1.8­2.5 A for the HN­O dis° tance and 2.8­3.5 A for the N­O distance, provided preliminary structural ensembles clearly indicated the probable acceptor atom. Dihedral restraints for u were derived from the HNHA experiment [35] and were given bounds of -55 ± 30° for helical residues with J \ 5 Hz and -120 ± 50° for extended residues with J [ 7.5 Hz. Dihedral restraints for w were given bounds of -47 ± 30° for helical residues and 140 ± 50° for extended residues.

Restraints for w were added only for residues in helices and beta sheets and only after consideration of amide-alpha NOE ratios (HNi­HAi vs. HNi­HAi - 1), alpha carbon chemical shifts, and the evident secondary structure propensities in preliminary ensembles of structures. Restraints for v1 for b-branched amino acids (I,V,T) were obtained from HNHB data together with NOE information, and were assigned values of 60°, -60°, or 180°, depending on the rotamer identified, with a range of ±45° on either side of the assigned angle. Preliminary structures were calculated with AutoStructure [18] and the resulting list of assigned NOEs was manually edited during refinement to remove non-restraining restraints and correct misassignments. The resulting distance restraints, together with the manually derived dihedral restraints, were used to generate a set of 30 structures with NIH-Xplor [28] using distance geometry and simulated annealing. The routines dg_sub_embed, dg_full_embed, and dgsa were used as provided except that in dgsa, an initial temperature of 2000 K was used with 30000 high temperature steps and 200,000 cooling steps. Sum averaging was used for methyl groups, methylene proton pairs, and equivalent aromatic ring protons. A final refinement in explicit water was performed in CNS [21]. Twenty (out of 30 total) structures were selected to form the final ensemble on the basis of minimal restraint violations and energies. Restraints were deposited in the Protein Data Bank, along with the structure (www.rcsb.org, PDB ID 1R57). Structure determination of the ligand-bound complex Though experiments showed that SACOL2532 bound both acetyl-CoA and CoA, and that the acetyl-group of acetylCoA was hydrolyzed over the course of several hours (below), we modeled acetyl-CoA bound to the protein. The HADDOCK approach [9] was used to calculate the structure of SACOL2532 with bound acetyl-CoA. While normally used for protein­protein docking, HADDOCK can be adapted to derive models of complexes between proteins and small-molecule ligands. Parameter and topology files were generated using the PRODRG server [27] and modified appropriately, for example to allow rotation about all single bonds. Initial calculations used only ambiguous interaction restraints derived from chemical shift perturbations on the protein surface, but these models had acetyl-CoA bound in more than one orientation. Subsequent calculations included intermolecular NOE restraints which restricted the orientation substantially. Ambiguous interaction restraints were generated for solvent-exposed residues whose peaks in 1H­15N-HSQC or 1 H­13C-HSQC spectra moved by an amount greater than one linewidth, or approximately 20­30 Hz. 500 structures were calculated in the initial rigid body docking stage, and

residues 38­58 and 73­86 of the protein, and all of the acetyl-CoA were allowed to be fully flexible. Two hundred structures were selected automatically by the HADDOCK software for second stage refinement, and the 100 of these with lowest energy were subjected to a second refinement in explicit solvent. The twenty lowest energy structures from the second refinement comprise the final ensemble of SACOL2532 with acetyl-CoA bound. The structural ensemble and experimental restraints for the protein­ligand complex were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 2H5M). The CNS parameter and topology files for acetylCoA can be obtained from the authors by request.

Results Sequence analysis Although the protein used for this structure determination was produced from a clone from the genomic DNA of S. aureus subsp. Rosenbach, which has not had its genome sequenced, we nonetheless refer to the protein as SACOL2532, the name given the homologue from the early methicillin-resistant strain COL, simply because the sequence is identical [13]. The names and strains (in parentheses) of the homologues from other sequenced S. aureus strains are SA2309 (N315), SAV2521 (Mu50), MW2441 (MW2), SAR2601 (MRSA252), and SAS2406 (MSSA476). Three amino acid substitutions are found among the sequences of homologues from the different strains. Relative to the amino acid sequence found in the structure, N21 is replaced with H in MRSA252 and MSSA476, while L57 and N68 are replaced with V and H, respectively, in N315, Mu50, MW2, MRSA252, and MSSA476. Although functional information about the GNAT-like proteins of COG2388 is sparse, it has been found that the SACOL2532 gene and its homologues from two other S. aureus strains are detected in microarray analysis of the rB regulon and appear to be upregulated in response to this alternative r factor [6]. A Psi-Blast search with SACOL2532 produced a set of more than 1000 proteins after a few iterations, and subsequent iterations continued to expand the size of the set of protein homologues. Many of these are annotated as putative GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNATs). All appear to fall within the scope of the Pfam GNAT family (PF00583), which contains thousands of sequences. A subfamily of about 150 sequences was generated by taking only the best matches after just two (cutoff around E \ 0.005) or three (cutoff around E \ 10-10) Psi-Blast iterations. Most of the proteins in this subfamily have a conserved cysteine residue (C75 in SACOL2532) and are around 100 residues in length. A diverse subset of these sequences is shown in Fig. 1. This subfamily appears to coincide with COG2388 [31]. None of the protein sequence records in GenBank for subfamily members contain any functional or phenotypic information. SACOL2532 and most of the other proteins from the subfamily contain around 100 amino acid residues, making them smaller than other GNATs, which typically have more than 150 residues. Among the members of this subfamily are SACOL2532 and its homologues from the other sequenced strains of S. aureus and S. epidermis, as well as homologues from numerous other bacterial species (e.g., E. coli YjdJ), eukaryotes (e.g., Arabidopsis, C. elegans, Drosophila, mouse, and human), and two archaeal homologues. One of the archaeal proteins, AF0345 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, appears to contain an additional small C-terminal domain.

Assessment of acetyl-CoA hydrolysis At low protein concentrations (10's of nM), hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA was assessed by monitoring the increase in A324 due to 4-thiopyridine release [15] when protein (10­ 100 nM), acetyl-CoA (1 mM), and 4,40 -dithiodipyridine (aldrithiol-4, 80 mM) were combined in 50 mM MES buffer pH 6.5 with 150 mM NaCl present. At high protein (0.25­1 mM) and acetyl-CoA (2.5­5 mM) concentrations, such as in NMR samples, the disappearance of the CoA-Sacetyl methyl resonance at 2.34 ppm and simultaneous appearance of an acetate methyl resonance at 1.91 ppm in 1D-1H NMR spectra were monitored as a function of time. Similar shifts of methylene protons in the b-mercaptoethylamine moiety of acetyl-CoA (a peak at 2.42 ppm disappears) and CoA (peaks appear at 2.46 and 2.62 ppm) also indicate hydrolysis of the acetyl group. Hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA was also detected indirectly by following the effects of acetate release on protein chemical shifts near the site at which the acetyl moiety binds to the protein.

Bioinformatics analysis All amino acid sequences were obtained from GenBank. Psi-Blast was used with default parameters to generate the protein sequence family [2]. ClustalW was used to generate the multiple sequence alignment [32]. ConSurf was used to visualize the structural distribution of conserved residues [14]. A structure similarity search using Dali [16] was conducted using the residues 4­94 of the first structure from the ensemble as a representative structure for similarity searching. Graphical depictions of protein structures were generated with PyMOL [8]. The quality of the structural ensemble was analyzed with PROCHECK-NMR [19] and MolProbity [23] with the PSVS server [5]. AutoStructure was used to evaluate RPF scores [17], which indicate the goodness-of-fit of the final ensemble of structures to the original peak-picked NOESY data.

Sequences are listed with Swiss-Prot ID numbers and three letter abbreviations for organisms. The first sequence is that of SACOL2532.

Dme, Drosophila melanogaster, Cel, Caenorhabditis elegans, Has, Homo sapiens. N-terminal sequences preceding the indicated residue are not shown. C-terminal extensions of 4, 15, 28, and 74 residues for the Lpl, Sco, Ape, and Afu sequences, respectively, are also omitted. Strictly conserved residues G51 and C75 in SACOL2532 are highlighted in black; other conserved residues are highlighted in grey. The site of the b-bulge conserved in GNATs is underlined. The omitted N-terminal region contains fewer conserved residues than the core region shown here, but is structured in SACOL2532, comprising b1 (residues 4­9), b2 (12­16), and the b2­b3 loop (17­22)

This additional domain has several archaeal homologues, though none of these homologues are from the only other archaeon represented in the subfamily, Aeropyrum pernix. Several sequences from the subfamily have a N-terminal extension of a few tens of residues as well. SACOL2532 contains the sequence G­G­Q­G­V­G in place of the canonical R/Q­X­X­G­X­G/A motif (part of motif A) that characterizes acetyl-CoA-binding sites in N-acetyltransferases. Many of the sequences in our subfamily more closely resemble the canonical motif, with an R or Q at the first position rather than G, and some have an A instead of G at the last position. Unlike other GNATs, however, the G at the second position in the motif is highly conserved (G51 in SACOL2532). SACOL2532 and related proteins contain regions corresponding to motifs D, A, and B of the GNAT family, which form the conserved N-acetyl transferase structural domain [11], while motif C is missing. Resonance assignments, experimental restraints, calculation of the protein structure Essentially complete 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift assignments were determined using standard triple-resonance NMR methods. The only missing assignments are in the first two residues, the His-tag at the C-terminus, and the imidazole rings of H40, H63, and H80. A total of 878 restraints were derived from the NMR data (Table 1). These include 740 restraining distance restraints derived from

NOESY data (45 intraresidue, 176 sequential, 147 medium range, and 372 long range), 58 H-bond restraints (two per Hbond), and 80 dihedral restraints (35 u restraints, 31 w restraints, 14 v - 1 restraints). NOE restraints were sparse or missing for residues 1­3, 44­52, and 94­102 (the His-tag), presumably due to linewidth broadening associated with intermediate time-scale motions. There are 9.5 restraints per restrained residue. The RMSDs for the superposition of backbone (N,Ca,C0 ) and heavy atoms of residues 5­44 and 52­93 to the average structures calculated for these same ° atoms and residues are 0.65 and 1.16 A, respectively. Other structural statistics are listed in Table 1.

Formation of the protein-ligand complex Chemical shift perturbations in 1H­15N- and 1H­13CHSQC spectra of SACOL2532 were observed upon addition of CoA or acetyl-CoA. (Fig. 2a, b). Titrations of CoA with protein showed that the ligand exhibits fast-exchange binding kinetics. Chemical shifts of perturbed resonances in the 1H­15N-HSQC spectrum recorded at 600 MHz moved incrementally towards their final position as substoichiometric quantities of CoA were added incrementally, finishing with [10-fold stoichiometric excess CoA. The midpoint of the chemical shift transitions occurred when approximately equimolar quantities of protein and ligand were present (Fig. 2c). A set of peaks exhibiting

Lack of significant acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity Nearly identical HSQC spectra were obtained whether CoA or acetyl-CoA were added to the protein. The key differences were seen in the resonances of T31 (HN and Hb), V43 (HN), and A78 (HN). By recording HSQC spectra as a function of time, conversion of acetyl-CoA to CoA could be observed as a shift of aforementioned atoms' chemical shifts to those seen in the sample to which CoA had been added (Fig. 2e). Following addition of acetyl-CoA and incubation at 20°C, these HN peaks migrated to the same chemical shifts seen when CoA was added, suggesting depletion of acetyl-CoA (and formation of CoA) over time. The conversion was complete after several hours in a sample of labeled protein to which approximately 10-fold excess acetyl-CoA had been added. One dimensional 1HNMR spectra of acetyl-CoA in solution with and without protein confirmed that hydrolysis occurred during this time. Hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA was observed by monitoring shifts of the protons in the acetyl and b-mercaptoethylamine moieties over several hours. Uncatalyzed hydrolysis of the labile acetyl thioester, presumably by water or reducing agent (DTT), was observed in a control experiment and occurred on a similar time scale to that with protein present. However hydrolysis appeared to occur somewhat more quickly with protein present, though still at most only a few turnovers per protein molecule per hour. When acetyl-CoA and 4,40 -dithiodipyridine (aldrithiol4) were incubated with a small amount of protein, no evidence of rapid CoA release was observed. The cysteine residue in the protein was maintained in the reduced state in the stock solution with DTT or BME, though the assay buffer did not contain reducing agents. Control experiments showed that these reducing agents were quickly consumed during the dead time of the assay by reaction with the reagent 4,40 -dithiodipyridine, which was present in excess. However, with protein present, there was no evidence that additional thiol groups (in CoA) were generated over time following consumption of the reducing agents. Similar negative results were obtained when the stock solution of reduced protein was exchanged into non-reducing buffer and used immediately. Electrospray ionization mass spectra of SACOL2532 recorded after incubation with acetyl-CoA showed no increase in mass versus spectra recorded without acetyl-CoA added, indicating no acetylation of the protein occurred, unless the acetyl-cysteine group was rapidly hydrolyzed by the aqueous buffer.

Three intermolecular H-bond restraints were added based on the conformational similarity of the pantothenic acid moiety of acetyl-CoA in the structure to that seen in X-ray structures of other acetyl-CoA-bound GNAT structures. These Hbonds were consistent with preliminary structures generated with only intermolecular NOE restraints, and with the apparent influence of the acetyl group on the chemical shifts of the T41 and V43 amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts (Fig. 2d). Analysis of the 4D-13C­13C-HMQC-NOESYHMQC collected on the acetyl-CoA-bound protein yielded three new intra-protein restraints, perhaps due to conformational changes of side chains in the binding site, while four restraints were removed from the original set of restraints used to calculate the structure in the absence of ° ligand. The final ensemble had RMSDs of 0.55 and 0.95 A to 0 the average structure for the backbone (N,Ca,C ) and heavy atoms, respectively, of residues 5­44 and 52­93 (Fig. 3a). Description of the structure The structure is a compact, mixed a+b fold that spans the entire sequence. The structure consists of a mixed b-sheet of five strands arranged b1­b2­b3­b4­b5 (Fig. 3b). The first four strands form a b-meander topology, and the fifth strand is parallel to the fourth. Two helices are present: a1 is between b4 and b5 and lies atop b-sheet, while a2 follows b5 and is perpendicular to the b-sheet and to a2. After the second helix, the backbone bends back towards b5 and makes bsheet-like contacts to this strand at a single residue. Looping turns are found between b1 and b2, and between b2 and b3. These turns curl away from the core structure to form a shallow depression on the surface. A four-residue turn links adjacent strands b3 and b4. Following b4 is a large loop (residues 44­52) that contains most of the putative acetylCoA binding motif (motif A). Conserved residues H40 and T41 occur just before this large loop, and H40 is the site of a b-bulge that is also seen in the same location in many other GNAT structures [11]. The conserved cysteine, C75, is at the beginning of a2 and close to H40 and T41 on the nearby strand b4. The large loop and a2 form the sides of a prominent crevice on the surface of the protein. Two residues further along a2, an aromatic residue (F77 in SACOL2532, also often tyrosine) that is conserved in most subfamily members occupies part of this crevice. This fold resembles that of the acetyl-CoA binding core domain of GNATs [11], but is smaller and missing some of the components, such as motif C and part of motif B, found in many other GNATs.

occur in a crevice formed by the large loop (residues 44­ 52) and a2 (Fig. 4a). The 1H­15N-HSQC spectrum of the SACOL2532/CoA complex showed that chemical shifts of residues in this same crevice were perturbed nearly exclusively (Fig. 4b), indicating this region is the binding site. Though amide chemical shift perturbations were observed throughout the large loop (residues 44­52), we did not observe a substantial increase in convergence in this region following CoA binding. Contacts between the ligand and residues in this loop likely involve hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between the protein and phosphate groups of CoA, which are not easily identifiable from NOESY data and therefore do not yield additional intermolecular distance restraints. Perturbations of methyl group and aromatic ring chemical shifts were also observed in 1H­13C HSQC spectra: methyl groups in residues V43, L47, L57, A73, A78, M81, L82, and L93 moved by more than one linewidth. The most dramatic shifts were seen for the M81 e-CH3 group, whose 1H chemical shift moved 0.25 ppm, and for some F77 aromatic ring protons, which moved upfield 0.95 ppm (Hd), and 0.35 ppm (Hf). Chemical shift averaging of the pairs of Hd and He protons is still observed. The 3D 13C-editedfiltered NOESY-HSQC [25] recorded on the SACOL2532/ CoA complex in D2O showed numerous NOESY cross peaks between protein and ligand. These peaks were

assigned with the help of the 2D doubly 13C-filtered 1H­1H NOESY and TOCSY experiments collected on the complex, and used as restraints. All NOE distance restraints that were added or deleted due to changes in the 4D 13 C­13C HMQC-NOESY-HMQC spectra following CoA binding involved the M81 eCH3. The new and deleted restraints suggest that the M81 e-CH3 moves away from the F77 aromatic ring and side chains of residues in the bsheet, and moves closer to side chains of residues in the two helices. The conformation of bound CoA in the complex with SACOL2532 is somewhat different than that seen in crystal structures of GNATs, with the exception of the SACOL2532 homologue At1g77540, where CoA is bound in a quite similar conformation (see discussion below). In the SACOL2532--CoA complex, the adenosine-30 -phosphate moiety bends back towards the pantothenic acid residue, like a fishhook, such that the ligand wraps around the F77 side chain (Fig. 4c). The residue at the structurally equivalent backbone position to F77 in yeast Hat1 is alanine. In crystal structures of GNATs, the adenosine-30 phosphate is extended away from the pantothenic acid because of different conformations about the C40 ­C50 , C50 ­ O5', and diphosphate P­O bonds [11]. In the only NMR structure of a histone N-acetyl transferase, the adenosine30 -phosphate moiety has yet another conformation [20]. The average distance from C75 Sc to the acetyl carbonyl

° carbon of acetyl-CoA in the ensemble is 4.9 ± 1.4 A. The structure of the protein changes very little overall: the RMSD over residues 4­93 for the average structures of ° each ensemble is 0.44 A. Comparison to other structures A Dali search for similar structures returned many examples of GNAT proteins. However, the most similar structure is a member of the subfamily we have defined: an X-ray structure of a protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, At1g77540 (PDB ID 1XMT). This structure, both free and with CoA bound (2IL4) has been described, along with the NMR structure (2EVN) of the ligand-free protein [33]. Of its 95 residues, 86 were identified as structurally similar (Fig. 5a), and the average RMSD to the X-ray structure (1XMT) for the Ca positions ° was 2.3 ± 0.2 A for the twenty NMR structures. The Z-score for the structural match was 11.3. The average heavy atom RMSD for the CoA ligands from the SACOL2532 complex ensemble superimposed on CoA from the At1g77540 com° plex was 2.7 ± 0.3 A. The sequence identity for the two proteins is 25%, among the lowest similarity to SACOL2532 for any sequence in the subfamily. The At1g77540 structure

shares many of the features noted in SACOL2532: the conserved C, T, and H residues adjacent to the acetyl-CoA binding site, the b-bulge at D39­H40, and the b1­b2 and b2­ b3 loops that curl away from the core. The overall conformation of bound CoA in the SACOL2532 and At1g77540 structures is similar (Fig. 5b); most differences are localized due to crankshaft-type torsions about pairs of adjacent bonds, for example a small displacement and rotation of the 30 phosphoribose ring due to torsions about the C50 ­O50 and O50 ­P1 bonds, such that the H50 protons would be pointed in opposite directions in the complexes. The next most similar structure to SACOL2532 is that of a GNAT, the yeast histone acetyl transferase Hat1 (PDB ID 1BOB [10]). Portions of ° Hat1 (88 residues, RMSD *3.0 A) align with the entire SACOL2532 structure (Z = 6.4) (Fig. 5a). However, the overall conformation of bound CoA is distinctly different from that seen in SACOL2532 and At1g77540 (Fig. 5b), with the adenine ring pointing in the opposite direction. Hat1 is a much larger protein than SACOL2532 or At1g77540, and only the acetyl-CoA-binding core of Hat1, which includes motifs A, B, and D, aligns with the two smaller proteins in a structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 5c). Though the SACOL2532 and Hat1 sequences are only 10% identical in

irregular turn and the short extended segment that contacts b5, and ends prematurely at the C-terminus; in GNATs this helix extends for several more residues. In the first part of motif B, only one residue, K84, near the end of a2 in SACOL2532, is conserved (either K or R) in both SACOL2532 and other subfamily proteins as well as in other GNAT sequences. In SACOL2532 as well as GNAT structures this residue appears to pair with the 30 -phosphate on adenosine in acetyl-CoA, despite the different orientation of the adenosine described above. Motif D contains the loop between b2 and b3 that bends distinctly away from the structure and continues on into b3. In GNATs such as Hat1, motif D makes extensive contacts with other regions and domains of these larger proteins that have no equivalent in SACOL2532 or other subfamily proteins.

Discussion A mapping of conserved residues in the sequence alignment onto the SACOL2532 structure emphasizes that the conserved residues of the SACOL2532 acetyl-CoA-binding motif (R/G­G­X­G­X­G/A) and three other conserved residues, C75, T41, and H40 are all located within the crevice or cleft between a1/b4 and the intervening loop on one side, and a2/b5 on the other (Figs. 3b, 4a). This crevice is the same one containing most of the residues experiencing amide chemical shift perturbations after addition of acetyl-CoA (Fig. 4b). The position of the acetyl-CoA in the calculated structural ensemble is consistent with these observations. A second grouping of conserved residues might be expected in an amine substrate binding site, but no such grouping is found. This suggests that if the subfamily members are indeed acetyl transferases, then different subfamily members do not all act on the same or similar substrates. Moreover, no obvious pocket in the surface is evident, aside from the CoA binding site, other than the small depression formed by the loops between b1 and b2, and b3 and b4. A substrate binding site could be located on another protein, or the substrate itself could be another protein. In either case, the binding surfaces among subfamily members might be expected to be heterogeneous and not necessarily correspond to a pocket or crevice, since the substrate or substrate-binding protein would itself be different in different organisms. Significant acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity was not observed under the conditions in which SACOL2532 was examined, suggesting that the protein is inactive until bound to substrate. The possibility is that SACOL2532 is not a N-acetyltransferase at all, but simply a dedicated acetyl-CoA hydrolase or a CoA carrier protein, is unlikely as the N-acetyltransferase domain fold [11] adopted by SACOL2532 is associated with transferase activity in numerous other instances.

For Hat1, the structurally similar acetyl-CoA-binding core region (green) is preceded by a separate domain of 133 residues (grey) with no equivalent in the typically smaller proteins such as SACOL2532 and other members of its subfamily. In addition, Hat1 contains insertions at the b1­b2 loop (residues 140­175), at the b3­b4 loop (residues 198­212, though 200­208 are missing in the X-ray structure) and between a2 and the C-terminus (273­301).

The much different orientation of the adenine and 30 -phosphoribose components of Yeast_Hat1-bound CoA are clearly visible.

The C75/T41/H40 trio resembles a catalytic triad such as is seen in proteases, although only the cysteine is strictly conserved in all sequences in the subfamily described here. The presence of the same three residues in At1g77540 suggests a mechanism similar to that of other acetyl transfer reactions [33], which require a proton acceptor to take a proton from the nucleophilic amine (or cysteine, if there is an acetyl enzyme intermediate), and a protein donor for protonation of the CoA thiolate leaving group; H40 might serve both purposes. All GNATs that have been structurally and functionally characterized appear to acetylate their amine substrates directly, without an acetyl enzyme intermediate [34]. However, the yeast histone acetyl transferase ESA1, from the MYST family, which shares the acetyl-CoA-binding core structure of GNATs (motif A) and adopts the N-acetyltransferase domain fold, was shown to use an acetyl enzyme intermediate [36], although this conclusion has been refuted recently in favor of a direct nucleophilic attack mechanism resembling other GNATs [4]. Nonetheless, the cysteine residue originally purported to be acetylated is conserved in ESA1 homologues. Arylamine N-acetyltransferases, which are not structurally similar to aliphatic amine N-acetyltransferases such as GNATs and related families, do have a conserved Cys­His­Asp catalytic triad and the cysteine becomes acetylated during the catalytic cycle [3, 29]. The location of the conserved cysteine in the subfamily suggests that it may become acetylated. This idea is supported by the observation that in X-ray structures of acetyl-CoA-bound GNATs, the backbone amide proton of the residue following the bbulge, which is the highly conserved threonine (T41 in SACOL2532) in COG2388 and related proteins, forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA [11]. In our structure and in the structure of the Arabidopsis homologue At1g77540 (PDB ID 1XMT), the T41 HN points toward the side chain of C75 a few ° Angstroms away, suggesting that the threonine amide helps to position the acetyl group for attack by the sulfhydryl of the nearby cysteine. Ligand-induced chemical shifts in 1 H­15N HSQC spectra of the CoA-bound protein show that the ligand binds in the expected area (Fig. 4b), and this observation was confirmed by the intermolecular NOESY data collected on the complex and used to generate the structure. We were also unable to detect acetylated protein by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in samples that had been incubated with acetyl-CoA (data not shown). It is possible that acetylation of the protein does not occur in the absence of bound substrate, that acetylated protein forms slowly but is rapidly hydrolyzed, or that the protein becomes inactive during purification, but it is clear that it binds both acetyl-CoA and CoA. The structure of SACOL2532 with acetyl-CoA bound suggests a key role in substrate binding for F77, which is

very often a phenylalanine or tyrosine in members of the subfamily, but not in other GNATs. In SACOL2532 the acetyl-CoA molecule nearly wraps around the F77 side chain (Fig. 4c), making contacts both from the adenosine ribosyl protons and from protons on the gem-dimethyl group of the pantothenic acid residue on the other side of the linking diphosphate. The strict conservation of C75 in all subfamily members argues for its importance as well. In ° our structure, the sulfur of C75 is found to be close (\5 A on average) to the carbonyl carbon of the acetyl group. The proximity in our model of the acetyl-CoA sulfur to C75 (Fig. 4c) suggests that it may become acetylated during the course of a two-step N-acetyl transfer reaction to an unknown amine substrate. Though we chose to use acetylCoA when generating our model of the protein­ligand complex, we observed that the acetyl thioester was cleaved during data acquisition. We observed small changes in four HSQC peaks during the course of hydrolysis of the acetylCoA complex: T41 HN and CHb, V43 HN, and A78 HN. Chemical shifts at the endpoint were identical to those of the CoA complex, indicating that hydrolysis occurred. Importantly, chemical shifts of the T41, V43, and A78 amides moved along somewhat different trajectories during acetyl-CoA hydrolysis and CoA titration, indicating that the shifts are influenced by the acetyl-group, and not entirely due to differential binding affinities of the two ligands. With 0.25 mM protein and about 5 mM acetylCoA, the half-life of the NH chemical shift transitions was on the order of hours. This could be the result of very weak catalysis by SACOL2532, but there is clearly a contribution from uncatalyzed hydrolysis by water or DTT in the buffer. Acetyl-CoA hydrolysis in the same buffer but in the absence of protein, monitored by 1D 1H-NMR measurement of chemical shifts in acetyl-CoA and CoA, was found to occur on a similar time scale. Protein-bound ligand undergoes fast exchange with unbound ligand, on the order of 105 s-1, much faster than the rate of hydrolysis, so each molecule sees both solvent and protein environments. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model in which the protein is essentially inactive by itself, and that rapid acetylation of C75 occurs only after formation of a ternary complex consisting of SACOL2532, acetyl-CoA, and a substrate protein. After formation of such a complex, presumably the acetyl group would be transferred to a substrate amine on a lysine side chain or at the N-terminus of a polypeptide. The 13C and 1H chemical shifts of C75 Cb and Hb do not change after addition of acetyl-CoA; therefore an alternative model in which C75 is rapidly acetylated in the absence of substrate and then slowly hydrolyzed is not supported. At this time there is no direct evidence in support of a model in which C75 is acetylated slowly and subsequently hydrolyzed by water in the absence of substrate on a time scale similar to that of

123

uncatalyzed hydrolysis by the buffer. However, such a model could explain the apparent very weak acceleration of acetyl-CoA hydrolysis observed at high protein concentrations.

Conclusion Following the structure determination of the protein SACOL2532, targeted by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, we have defined a novel sequence subfamily of acetyl-CoA binding proteins that adopt the core acetylCoA-binding structural fold of GCN5-like N-acetyltransferases (GNATs). Despite the similar core structure, proteins in the subfamily are distinctly different from other GNATs. They are smaller, often around 100 residues, whereas most GNATs have at least 150 residues. In the first part of sequence motif B, only one residue in the structure based sequence alignment is conserved, and there is no structural equivalent to the latter part of motif B, which forms a much longer helix in other GNATs. Motif A, the acetyl-CoA-binding motif that is essential not just to GNATs but to other families of N-acetyltransferases such as MYST, can be identified in SACOL2532, but it differs in the positioning of the most conserved residues in the structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 5c). Moreover, motif C is absent entirely; among GNATs, this is a characteristic shared only by histone acetyltransferases. In fact, there is no obvious substrate binding site, and much of that which is missing when SACOL2532 and other COG2388 proteins are compared to most GNATs includes parts of those structures involved in binding the substrate amine. Therefore we speculate that, as with histone acetyltransferases, the substrate could be another protein. An alternative possibility is that a substrate binding site is located on another protein to which proteins from this subfamily can bind, and that second protein is required to form a functional enzyme. Indeed, weak N-acetyltransferase activity towards specific histones was demonstrated for At1g77540, the Arabidopsis homologue of SACOL2532 [33], though presumably this leaves open the question of what is the substrate for all the bacterial and archaeal members of the subfamily. Another characteristic of subfamily proteins that is found in both SACOL2532 and At1g77540 appears to be an idiosyncratic CoA conformation that is distinct from that seen in many other GNATs. Finally, SACOL2532 and other COG2388 and related proteins all contain a highly conserved cysteine in the acetylCoA binding site on helix a2 that suggests the presence of an acetyl-enzyme intermediate in the reaction mechanism. The proximity of the strictly conserved cysteine residue to the acetyl thioester of bound acetyl-CoA suggests that the cysteine may become acetylated by acetyl-CoA, perhaps

only after substrate binding, following which transfer to a substrate amine group occurs. It is unclear why this particular subfamily of GNATs stands apart from most other GNATs in its apparent utilization of an acetyl-enzyme intermediate mechanism. The substrate or substrates for SACOL2532 and related GNAT-like proteins from COG2388 remains to be identified, but the same is true for many other putative GNATs [34].
