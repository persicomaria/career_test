Crystal structure and dimerization equilibria of PcoC, a methionine-rich copper resistance protein from Escherichia coli
Received: 18 July 2002 / Accepted: 20 August 2002 / Published online: 27 September 2002 Ó SBIC 2002

Abstract PcoC is a soluble periplasmic protein encoded by the plasmid-born pco copper resistance operon of Escherichia coli. Like PcoA, a multicopper oxidase encoded in the same locus and its chromosomal homolog CueO, PcoC contains unusual methionine rich sequences. Although essential for copper resistance, the functions of PcoC, PcoA, and their conserved methionine-rich sequences are not known. Similar methionine motifs observed in eukaryotic copper transporters have been proposed to bind copper, but there are no precedents for such metal binding sites in structurally characterized proteins. The high-resolution structures of apo PcoC, determined for both the native and selenomethionine-containing proteins, reveal a seven-stranded b barrel with the methionines unexpectedly housed on a solvent-exposed loop. Several potential metal-binding sites can be discerned by comparing the structures to spectroscopic data reported for copper-loaded PcoC. In the native structure, the methionine loop interacts with the same loop on a second molecule in the asymmetric unit. In the selenomethionine structure, the methionine loops are more exposed, forming hydrophobic patches

Introduction
Methionine-rich sequence motifs are found in a number of proteins involved in copper metabolism. Although the function of these motifs is unknown, they have been postulated to bind copper. In eukaryotes, methionine motifs are present in the Ctr family of membrane transporters [1, 2]. In prokaryotes, these motifs are found in plasmid- and chromosomally encoded copper proteins including the pco (plasmid-borne copper resistance), cop (copper resistance) and cue (Cu export) operons. The pco containing operon was found in a plasmid in an Escherichia coli culture isolated from a piggery where CuSO4 was used as an antibiotic and growth-promoting additive [3, 4]. The plasmid containing the cop operon was found in Pseudomonas syringae growing on tomato plants treated with a copper-containing bactericide [5, 6]. A similar operon has been isolated from the walnut pathogen Xanthomonas campestris [7, 8]. Two other resistance operons found in the E. coli chromosome show little similarity to the pco locus, including the unrelated cue regulon [9, 10] and cus, which plays an important role in copper tolerance under both anaerobic and extreme copper stress conditions [11, 12]. Both the pco and the P. syringae cop operons encode six homologous proteins, but the pco locus includes an

186

adjacent seventh gene driven by a separate copper-responsive promoter [11]. Although the gene products are homologous, the two systems are postulated to function in different manners [13]. The cop proteins can sequester copper in the periplasm and outer membranes to such high levels that the resistant bacterial colonies are blue [14, 15]. By contrast, bacteria with the pco determinant show no significant copper accumulation and do not become blue upon copper exposure [16], but do exhibit enhanced copper export [17]. Each system includes two soluble periplasmic proteins that contain methioninerich sequences, PcoA and PcoC from the pco operon, and CopA and CopC from the cop operon. Mutation of the two proteins interferes with copper resistance [5, 17], and deletion of either gene results in copper hypersensitivity [18]. Genetic and biochemical studies have not yet established the function of these proteins, however. According to one model, PcoC scavenges Cu(I) and conducts it to the PcoA oxidase. It has been proposed that PcoA then catalyzes air oxidation of Cu(I) to the less toxic Cu(II) form [18]. PcoA and CopA both comprise $600 amino acid residues and are homologous to multicopper oxidases [13]. Multicopper oxidases [19] like ascorbate oxidase [20] and laccase [21] are known to oxidize a wide variety of organic substrates and some multicopper oxidases such as Fet3 [22] and ceruloplasmin [23] apparently catalyze the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III). The ligands to the type 1, type 2, and type 3 copper centers in these oxidases are conserved in PcoA and CopA. In addition, PcoA and CopA contain 21 conserved methionines, arranged in multiple MXXM (single letter amino acid code where X is any amino acid) units and several conserved histidines. This methioninerich region is also present in CueO, a chromosomally encoded E. coli multicopper oxidase involved in copper tolerance [12, 24, 25]. CopA reportedly binds up to 11 copper ions, four of which probably bind in the putative oxidase sites. The remaining copper ions are thought to be coordinated by the conserved methionine motifs [14].

The recent crystal structure of CueO reveals just the four copper ions bound in the oxidase sites. Part of the methionine-rich region forms an a helix covering the substrate binding site, and the remainder is disordered. It is possible that these disordered residues bind additional copper ions [26]. PcoC and CopC are $100 amino acid residue proteins that contain a MTXMXGMXXH/MXPM sequence motif (Fig. 1). Purified PcoC [18] and CopC [14] both bind one copper ion per monomer. Although PcoC has been postulated to shuttle Cu(I) to PcoA, it can bind either Cu(I) or Cu(II) in vitro [18], and its oxidation state in vivo is not known. Characterization by electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), electron spin echo modulation (ESEEM) [18], and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies [27] indicates that PcoC binds Cu(II) via two or more histidines and a water in a tetragonally distorted site. By contrast, EXAFS studies of the Cu(I) form of the protein reveal a three coordinate Cu(I) in an environment consistent with binding of two methionines and an O- or N-donor such as histidine. Although a tetragonal Cu(II) site is observed in many other metalloproteins, no such precedent is known for the proposed Cu(I) thioether site. To develop a structural basis for testing the proposed functions of these proteins and to gain insight into the role of the methionine motifs, we have determined the high resolution X-ray structure of PcoC and examined the ability of the protein to associate with itself in aqueous solution.

Materials and methods
Overexpression and purification of PcoC The selenomethionine and native PcoC proteins were purified according to protocols described previously [18]. To generate the selenomethionine form of PcoC, the overexpression vector pDLHII265 [18] was transformed into E. coli strain B834(DE3).

187 For large scale preparations, a 50 mL culture grown in LB media supplemented with 100 lg/mL ampicillin was agitated at 250 rpm overnight, centrifuged, the supernatant removed, and the cells resuspended in 50 mL of M9 minimal media [28]. A 6-mL aliquot of this preparation was then used to inoculate each of eight flasks containing 1 L M9 minimal media containing 40 mg each of all amino acids with selenomethionine substituted for methionine, 2 mg thiamine, 500 mg each of adenosine, guanosine, thymine, and uracil, 246 mg MgSO4Æ7H2O, 10 g glucose as a carbon source [29], and 100 mg ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mM IPTG at an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm, and the temperature was reduced to 30 °C. After 6 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellet stored at ­80 °C. For purification of native PcoC, 5 mL overnight cultures of BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pDLHII265 were used to inoculate 1 L cultures in LB media supplemented with 100 lg/mL ampicillin. Cells were grown to an optical density of 0.7 at 600 nm, induced with 0.5 mM IPTG, harvested 3 h after induction, and stored at ­80 °C. ° a=b=c=107.46 A. All selenomethionine PcoC data were collected at the DND-CAT beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK [30] (k1, k2, k3, SEMET, Table 1). Crystals of native PcoC were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. A precipitant solution consisting of 0.1 M HEPES/Na pH 7.5 and 4.3 M NaCl yielded a single large wedge shaped crystal with dimensions of 0.1·0.3·0.7 mm. This crystal was soaked in a cryosolution consisting of the crystallization buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol (v/v) and 2 mM CuSO4 for 15 min, flash cooled, and used for data collection. The native PcoC crystals belong to space group P41 with ° unit cell dimensions a=b=70.13 and c=39.07 A. Native PcoC data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory and processed with MOSFLM [31] and SCALA [32] (NATIVE, Table 1). Numerous attempts to crystallize both the Cu(II) and Cu(I) forms of PcoC only yielded crystals of poor diffraction quality. Crystals of apo protein were also soaked aerobically in solutions containing CuSO4 and anaerobically in solutions containing CuCl. Structures refined from data sets collected on these soaked crystals contained no detectable copper, however. Interestingly, both the NATIVE and SEMET high-resolution data sets were obtained from crystals soaked in a cryosolution containing CuSO4, but neither structure contains any observable copper. Structure determination Data for Se MAD phasing were collected at three wavelengths using the reverse beam technique. The program SOLVE [33] was used to locate the ten selenium positions in the asymmetric unit and ° to generate an initial electron density map to 1.8 A resolution. A model was built using the program O [34] and refined with CNS [35] by iterative cycles of simulated annealing, B-factor refinement and model adjustment. The asymmetric unit contains two PcoC molecules related by a noncrystallographic twofold axis. Non-

Crystallization and data collection Crystals of selenomethionine PcoC were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at both room temperature and 18 °C using protein at a concentration of 7 mg/mL. Large regular cubes formed overnight using a precipitant solution containing 0.1 M HEPES/Na pH 7.5 and 1.4 M citrate, and continued growing for several days to maximum dimensions of 0.6·0.6·0.6 mm. Crystals for Se multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data collection were transferred to a cryosolution consisting of the crystallization buffer supplemented with 22% (w/v) sucrose and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen after 15 min. Crystals for the high resolution data set were soaked overnight in the same cryosolution supplemented with 0.5 mM CuSO4. The selenomethionine PcoC crystals belong to the space group I23, with unit cell dimensions

188 crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed until the R-free ° dropped below 0.30 for refinement to 2.0 A resolution. The refinement was then continued using the high resolution SEMET data set (Table 1). The final model includes residues 2­103 in monomer A, residues 1­103 in monomer B, and 193 water molecules. A Ramachandran plot generated with PROCHECK [36] indicates that the SEMET model exhibits good geometry with 90.5% of the residues in the most favored regions and all other residues in the additionally allowed regions. The structure of native PcoC was determined by molecular replacement using one monomer from the SEMET structure as a starting model. Two solutions with a correlation coefficient of 0.445 and an R-factor of 0.518 were identified using the CCP4 program MOLREP [32]. The model was refined with CNS using rigid body refinement followed by iterative rounds of simulated annealing, minimization, B-factor refinement, and model adjustment with XtalView [37]. The final model contains residues 1­45 and 49­104 in monomer A, residues 1­104 in monomer B, 322 water molecules, and 5 glycerol molecules. A Ramachandran plot generated with PROCHECK [36] indicates that the NATIVE model exhibits good geometry with 90.3% of the residues in the most favored regions and all other residues in the additionally allowed regions. Intermonomer interactions were analyzed with the CCP4 program AREAIMOL [32], and figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT [38], RASTER3D [39], and GRASP [40]. The refined coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 1LYQ for native PcoC and 1IX2 for selenomethionine PcoC.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry The mass spectrum of the pure apo-protein used in analytical ultracentrifugation was collected on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager DE-Pro instrument in the Analytical Services Laboratory at Northwestern University. The matrix used in these experiments was 10 mg/mL a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, in a solution of 1:1 water and acetonitrile, which was also 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The PcoC spectra were internally calibrated to a horse heart cytochrome c standard with a molecular weight of 12 361 Da.

Results and discussion
Overall structure The structure of PcoC was solved in two different space groups (SEMET and NATIVE, Table 1). The protein comprises a seven-stranded antiparallel b barrel (Figs. 2a and 3a). For both space groups, two molecules related by a noncrystallographic twofold axis were found in the asymmetric unit. The two monomers in each asymmetric unit are very similar with root mean square (rms) deviations for Ca atom coordinates of ° ° 0.187 A for the SEMET structure and 0.114 A for the NATIVE structure. The monomers from the two different structures are also quite similar and can be superimposed with rms deviations for Ca atom ° coordinates of $1 A. The molecules in the NATIVE structure are arranged in a `head to head' fashion (Fig. 2) whereas a `head to tail' configuration is observed in the SEMET structure (Fig. 3). The change in accessible surface area per monomer upon dimer for° ° mation ranges from 336 A2 to 386 A2 for the four ° monomers. These values are well below the $600 A2 minimal surface area typically expected for stable dimer formation [44]. In addition, there are no hydrogen bonds or major hydrophobic interaction surfaces. These observations combined with the presence of two distinct arrangements suggest that both dimers may result from crystal packing. Although analytical gel filtration results indicate that some self-association of apo PcoC can be readily observed in solution [18], these studies did not resolve the oligomerization state of aggregates. In fact, the apparent molecular weights did not clearly correspond to monomers or dimers. Based on the structure, the protein may exhibit atypical hydrodynamic properties. Oligomerization state in solution To delineate the oligomerization state of the protein in solution and to frame the energetics of oligomerization, analytical ultracentrifugation of apo and Cu(I) PcoC was performed. A large concentration range can be ac-

Analytical ultracentrifugation All sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-A in the Keck Biophysics Facility at Northwestern University. Data analysis was performed with UltraScan version 6.0 [41]. Hydrodynamic corrections for buffer conditions were made according to data published by Laue et al [42], and as implemented in UltraScan. The partial specific volume of PcoC was estimated according to the method by Cohn and Edsall, and as implemented in UltraScan (PcoC partial specific volume: 0.73726 ccm/g) [43]. 95% confidence statistics were determined using Monte Carlo analyses, which were calculated on a 40-processor Linux Beowulf cluster configured with Slackware Linux version 7.0. All samples were analyzed in a buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with 250 mM NaCl. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 4 °C and speeds ranging from 20 000 to 50 000 rpm with 8000­ 6000 rpm increments. Equilibrium times were estimated using the finite element approach-to-equilibrium simulation module in UltraScan and determined to be as follows: (20 krpm: 41 h, 28 krpm: 94 h, 36 krpm: 147 h, 44 krpm: 154 h, 50 krpm: 176 h). The samples were centrifuged in six-channel EPON (Shell Chemical) filled centerpieces in the AN-50-TI rotor. For each sample, six different loading concentrations were measured. The optical densities of the samples were 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 OD at 230 nm and 280 nm for the apo PcoC sample and 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 OD at 280 nm, and 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 OD at 230 nm for the Cu(I) PcoC sample. Scans were collected in radial step mode with 0.001 cm stepsize setting and 15 replicates. When globally fitting data from different wavelengths to concentration-dependent models such as reversibly self-associating monomer-dimer models, the extinction differences at multiple wavelengths need to be taken into account. To this end, wavelength scans between 200 and 340 nm were taken in triplicate at 1 nm stepsize setting with ten replicates. Six different loading concentrations were measured, and data between 0 and 0.9 OD were collected. Extinction profiles were generated by globally fitting all scans to sums of five Gaussian terms, resulting in a extinction profile for the protein. The profile is normalized using the extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 8460 M­1 cm­1 for the apo sample and 11926 M­1 cm­1 for the Cu(I) sample determined from Beers

complished by varying the loading concentration and the wavelength of the measurement thereby exploiting the various absorption properties of the protein. Extinction profiles generated from the global wavelength fits resulted in the extinction profiles shown in Fig. 4. These correspond, as expected, to the spectra determined separately, thereby corroborating the global fits. By globally fitting equilibrium data observed under multiple conditions, such as multiple rotor speeds and multiple loading concentrations, it is possible to enhance the confidence in each fitted parameter value [45]. In such a fit, parameters such as monomer molecular weight and association constants are considered global parameters and forced to be the same for all included

data sets. For the global equilibrium analysis, 21 equilibrium scans from the Cu(I) form and 17 from the apo form ranging in speeds between 20 000 rpm and 50 000 rpm and loading concentrations between 0.2 and 0.7 OD, at both 230 nm and 280 nm, were fitted to single ideal and monomer-dimer (Fig. 5) and monomerdimer-tetramer reversibly self-associating models. For both forms of PcoC, the fitting statistics improved significantly when monomer-dimer models were fitted compared to single ideal species models, but no improvement was observed upon changing the model to a monomer-dimer-tetramer model (data not shown). The improvement of the fit in going from single ideal species model to monomer-dimer model was most pronounced for the Cu(I) form of PcoC, which forms a tighter dimer (Table 2). Thus, the system could be well described by a monomer-dimer equilibrium model. This can be further seen in random residuals for the latter fit. A distribution of monomer and dimer species over the analyzed concentration range is shown in Fig. 6. Equilibrium experiments performed on the copper and apo forms of PcoC are consistent with the

reversibly self-associating monomer-dimer system. As suggested based on gel filtration data [18], a significantly stronger dimerization is observed for the Cu(I) form. The association constant for dimerization of Cu(I) PcoC in Table 2 is comparable to that observed in several systems including procarboxypeptidase A (Ka=8.6·103 at 5 °C), b lactoglobulin (Ka=4.9·103 at 25 °C), tryptophanase (Ka=1.2·104 at 5 °C) and hemoglobin (Ka=8·104 for 2ab M (ab)2 at 25 °C) [46]. By contrast, the association constant for apo PcoC is quite weak, and the variance at 95% confidence level is high. Given that self-association is observed in gel filtration data for apo PcoC [18], the value in Table 2 is best considered an upper limit for the dimerization constant of the apo protein. The monomer molecular weights determined were in excellent agreement with

the theoretical molecular weight derived from the protein sequence (11 049.6 Da), the molecular weight reported previously by ESI-MS (11 047±2 Da) [18], and with the molecular weight of 11 045±5 Da as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the pure apo protein used to make these samples. The two peaks observed in analytical gel filtration studies of a 200 lM PcoC sample [18] can now be interpreted in terms of monomer and dimer. The area of these peaks have been determined and are consistent with $10% of the total protein being present in the dimeric state. Using the association constant for apo PcoC dimer shown in Table 2, we calculate that $6% (Fig. 6) of the protein should be in the dimer state at this concentration. Given the general uncertainties in converting gel filtration profiles into equilibrium distributions, this constitutes reasonable agreement between the two methods and thus provides independent corroboration for the association constants within the ranges given in Table 2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PcoC can form stable, albeit weakly associated dimeric species and that protein-protein interactions occur in solution. It is not clear whether the dimerization

191

observed in solution is related to the dimers observed in the crystal structures, but the fact that Cu(I) binding significantly favors dimer formation (D(DG°) = ­8.0 kJ/mole) leads to the idea that copper binds at the dimer interface. Location of the methionine motifs The methionine-rich sequence MTGMKGMSSHSPM is located on a solvent-exposed loop spanning residues 41 to 53. In the NATIVE or `head to head' structure, this loop points toward the same loop in the second PcoC molecule, bringing seven methionines into close proximity (Fig. 2). The eighth methionine, Met 47 in one of the two molecules, was not visible in the electron density and could not be modeled. Although the interface between the two molecules is small in size, the change in accessible surface area per methionine residue is signifi° ° cant, ranging from 6 A2 to 83 A2. Thus, the effect of bringing the two molecules together is to bury the methionine residues (Figs. 2c and 2d). In the SEMET structure, the two methionine loops are located at opposite ends of the asymmetric unit and do not interact (Fig. 3a). Instead, all the methionines point toward the solvent and form two separate hydrophobic patches on the protein surface (Figs. 3b and 3c). The methionine loops adopt somewhat different conformations in the

The area inside the gray box indicates the concentration range in which the measurements were made. Due to the weak association of the apo form, very little dimer was observed at the concentration at which the measurements were taken

SEMET and NATIVE structures, with deviations in ° Ca atom coordinates of up to 3.5 A. These deviations suggest that the loop is flexible and are likely due to the different packing of the two molecules and the substitution of selenomethionine for methionine. Comparison to spectroscopic data and possible metal binding sites Although PcoC binds one copper ion in solution [18], efforts to crystallographically characterize the copper loaded form were unsuccessful. According to ENDOR and ESEEM spectroscopic data [18], the Cu(II) ion in PcoC is tetragonally coordinated by three nitrogens and one aqua (OHx) ligand, with a second aqua and a sulfur from methionine nearby. One of the nitrogen ligands corresponds to a histidine, but the identity of the other two nitrogens could not be determined. These findings are consistent with EXAFS data [27], which indicate the presence of four N/O ligands for the Cu(II) form. The

XAS data for the Cu(I) form reveal a trigonal site best modeled as Cu(I) bound to two S and one N/O or to two N/O and one S. These combined results suggest that PcoC utilizes two different coordination environments for Cu(I) and Cu(II). It is not known whether these two coordination environments correspond to the same site in the protein. Taking these spectroscopic data into account, the structures and energetics limit the range of possible coordination sites. Since PcoC contains no cysteines, any sulfur ligands bound to the Cu(I) form must derive from methionine. There are four methionines, Met 41, Met 44, Met 47, Met 53, and one histidine, His 50, in the methionine loop (Figs. 2a, 2b, and 3a). Whereas the methionines are highly conserved, His 50 is not present in all PcoC homologs, including that from X. campestris. Two additional histidines, His 2 and His 93, are conserved, however (Fig. 1). These histidines are located at the opposite end of the molecule from the methionine loop (Figs. 2a and 3a). In one molecule of the SEMET structure, these histidines are very close to one another ° with an $5 A separation between the two d nitrogen or the two  nitrogen atoms. His 2 is not visible in the second molecule in the SEMET asymmetric unit. In the NATIVE structure, His 2 and His 93 are farther apart ° with an $9 A N­N distance for the two d nitrogens and ° for the two  nitrogens. Finally, PcoC contains a $9.5 A fifth methionine, Met 68, which is quite distant from any of the other potential metal ligands. There are several possible scenarios for how these residues might coordinate copper. Coordination of Cu(I) by the methionines in the methionine loop and His 50 would be consistent with the EXAFS data [27]. To accommodate Cu(II) coordination at this site in a manner consistent with the EXAFS and EPR data, two peptide nitrogens would also have to be ligands, an unlikely possibility given the high pKa of such groups. If PcoC and its homologs bind copper in the same fashion, an evolutionarily conserved metal binding motif involving His 50 may be unlikely since this histidine is not conserved in X. campestris (Fig. 1). The two conserved histidines at the opposite side of the protein, His 2 and His 93 (Figs. 2a and 3a), are better candidates for Cu(II) ligands. Coordination of a Cu(II) ion by these spatially adjacent histidines is reasonable, and the amino terminal nitrogen could be the third ligand. Coordination of

193

Cu(II) by the N-terminal nitrogen is observed in serum albumin and other polypeptides, although PcoC does not have the other features associated with this binding motif [47]. Another problem with this mode of coordination is that the ENDOR data indicate the presence of a nearby methionine [18], but the closest methionine, ° Met 68, is 20 A away. The structural and oligomerization data could be better reconciled with the spectroscopic data and sequence alignments if the copper ion were coordinated by two PcoC molecules. Both possible sites, the methionine loop and the combination of His 2, His 92, and the Nterminus, are surface exposed and accessible to other proteins. The `head to head' NATIVE structure (Fig. 2) shows one way in which two methionine loops could together form a thioether-rich copper binding site with two His 50 residues also available for binding. The fact that His 50 is not conserved suggests that this arrangement may be unlikely. Alternatively, two monomers could be positioned `head to tail' like in the SEMET structure (Fig. 3). This model can accommodate both Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions in a manner that is consistent with the EPR and EXAFS data. This type of dimer may not be stable, however, since there is even less of a dimer interface in the `head to tail' SEMET structure (Fig. 3) than in the `head to head' NATIVE structure (Fig. 2). Finally, there is no requirement that Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions must bind at the same site. The structures raise the possibility that Cu(I) is coordinated by the methionine loop, whereas Cu(II) is coordinated by His 2, His 92, and the N-terminal nitrogen. These two proposed sites are more compatible with the spectroscopic data and sequence alignments than both Cu(I) and Cu(II) binding at either of these sites. Proposed role of the methionine motifs The structural data suggest another possible role for the methionine loop: it may participate in protein-protein interactions. Notably, methionine residues have been proposed to be particularly well suited for recognition of diverse sequences [48, 49]. In the SEMET structure, the methionines form a hydrophobic patch on the protein surface (Figs. 3b and 3c). In the NATIVE structure, two of these patches interact, burying most of the methionines (Fig. 2c and 2d). It is conceivable that similar interactions could occur between a PcoC monomer and a putative partner protein such as PcoA. Two proposed functions of PcoC are metal and/or electron transfer [18]. If PcoC is a metallochaperone, the methionine motif might facilitate Cu(I) binding and/or docking with a target protein, and subsequent copper transfer. PcoC could also dock with an electron transfer partner via the methionine motif. Hydrophobic interactions are known to be important in the electron transfer complex between plastocyanin and cytochrome f [50]. The multicopper oxidase PcoA is a potential docking target for PcoC, but a direct interaction between the two proteins has yet to

be demonstrated. Under conditions of oxidative stress, such an interaction could be further tuned by oxidation of the exposed methionines to methionine sulfoxide [51], thus altering the properties of the protein surface [48]. Biochemical and structural studies directed at probing the possible role of the PcoC methionine motif in protein-protein interactions are underway.
