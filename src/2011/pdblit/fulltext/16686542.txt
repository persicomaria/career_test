S-Ribosylhomocysteinase (LuxS) catalyzes the cleavage of the thioether linkage in S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH) to produce homocysteine and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione, the precursor of autoinducer 2. Inhibitors of LuxS should interfere with bacterial interspecies communication and potentially provide a novel class of antibacterial agents. LuxS utilizes a divalent metal ion as a Lewis acid during catalysis. In this work, a series of structural analogues of the substrate SRH and a 2-ketone intermediate were designed and synthesized. Kinetic studies indicate that the compounds act as reversible, competitive inhibitors against LuxS, with the most potent inhibitors having KI values in the submicromolar range. These represent the most potent LuxS inhibitors that have been reported to date. Cocrystal structures of LuxS bound with two of the inhibitors largely confirmed the design principles, i.e., the importance of both the homocysteine and ribose moieties in high-affinity binding to the LuxS active site.
Introduction is one type of bacterial cell-to-cell Quorum sensing communication, which regulates a diverse array of physiological and pathological activities in bacteria in a cell-density-dependent manner.1 QS is mediated by the synthesis, release, and detection of small signaling molecules, called autoinducers (AIs). There are two major types of QS systems. Type I QS is species specific, with each bacterial species having a unique AI-1 molecule or in some cases a unique combination of AI-1 molecules. Gram-negative bacteria generally use acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) as their AI-1's, whereas Gram-positive bacteria employ oligopeptides or modified oligopeptides. Correspondingly, each species possesses a cognate AI-1 receptor protein to recognize and respond to the signal. Since the interactions between AI-1's and their cognate receptors are highly specific, AI-1's generally do not cause any cross talk in mixed populations of bacteria. To sense the presence of other species in a mixed population (interspecies communication), bacteria utilize an alternative mechanism (type II QS) in which a common signal, AI-2, is released and detected.2,3 AI-2 has been identified as a furanosyl borate diester in Vibrio harVeyi, by determining the X-ray crystal structure of LuxP in complex with the active AI-2 ligand.4 Very recently, the same team showed that active AI-2 in Salmonella typhimurium is (2R,4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran (R-THMF).5 AI-2 is biosynthesized from S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is hydrolyzed by nucleosidase Pfs into adenine and S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH).6 SRH is next converted into homocysteine (Hcys) and 4,5dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) by S-ribosylhomocysteinase (LuxS). DPD is unstable and spontaneously cyclizes to form

R-THMF (S. typhimurium AI-25) and (2S,4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran, which spontaneously forms a complex with borate as V. harVeyi AI-2.4 Since QS controls many bacterial behaviors including biofilm formation and bacterial virulence, proteins involved in quorum sensing are being explored as novel targets for antibacterial drug design.7-9 Halogenated furanone derivatives have been shown to act as AI-1 antagonists and inhibit the expression of virulence factors by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and increase bacterial susceptibility to the antibiotic tobramycin.10-12 In a mouse pulmonary infection model, the drug inhibited quorum sensing of the infecting bacteria and promoted their clearance by the mouse immune response.12 Suga and co-workers synthesized a series of AHL analogues, some of which acted as antagonists of quorum sensing and interfered with virulence expression and biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa.13,14 LuxS/AI-2 also regulates a host of bacterial behaviors including virulence, biofilm formation, motility, toxin and antibiotic production, luminescence, and ABC transporter expression.7 Further, the luxS gene is present in the majority of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and is highly conserved.7 Thus, AI-2 antagonists and LuxS inhibitors have the potential as a class of unconventional, broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Two SRH analogues have recently been reported as weak inhibitors of LuxS (IC50  1 mM),15 but potent LuxS inhibitors are still lacking. In this work, a series of substrate and intermediate analogues have been synthesized and tested for inhibition against LuxS, and the best compounds showed KI values in the high nanomolar range. Chemistry LuxS is a metalloenzyme containing an Fe2+ ion coordinated by His-54, His-58, and Cys-126 (amino acid numbering in Bacillus subtilis LuxS) and a water molecule.16-19 The native enzyme is unstable under aerobic conditions, undergoing oxidation of the Fe2+ ion and loss of enzymatic activity.16 Substitution of Co2+ for the native metal ion produces a highly stable variant of essentially wild-type catalytic activity, whereas the Zn2+-substituted enzyme has 10-fold lower activity.16 In the proposed catalytic mechanism of LuxS (Figure 1), the metal ion acts as a Lewis acid, facilitating two consecutive aldoseketose isomerization steps and a final -elimination reaction.20

UV-vis absorption spectroscopy16 and X-ray crystallographic studies21 revealed that the catalytic metal ion is directly coordinated with the C-2 carbonyl oxygen of a 2-ketone intermediate (compound 4 in Figure 1). During the conversion of SRH to intermediate 4 or from intermediate 4 to 3-ketone intermediate 7, it was proposed that the metal ion plays a key role in stabilizing the enediolate intermediates (2, 3, 5, and 6) by binding to them in a bidentate manner (Figures 1 and 2A). We envisioned that replacement of the unstable enediolate moiety with a planar hydroxamate group (compound 10) should produce a stable isostere with high affinity and specificity for LuxS (Figure 2). Compound 11, which is an stereoisomer of 10 with opposite stereochemical configuration at the carbon (relative to the hydroxamate), and compound 12, which does not contain the Hcys moiety, were synthesized for comparison. The X-ray crystal structure of LuxS bound to intermediate 4 shows that the main interactions between the intermediate and the protein are mediated by the two termini of the compound; i.e., the amino and carboxyl groups of the Hcys moiety fit into a pocket remote from the active site, formed by residues Lys35, Arg-65, Asp-78, Ile-79, and Ser-80, whereas the ribose is bound to the metal center.21 There is little direct interaction between the hydrophobic linker of compound 4 and the active site. Therefore, we also designed compounds 13-16, in which the amino acid moiety and a metal chelating group (thiol or N-formylhydroxylamine) are connected with linkers of varying lengths (Figure 2). Synthesis of compound 10 started from commercially available D-erythronic--lactone, which was treated with excess benzyl bromide and silver oxide to protect the hydroxyl groups (Scheme 1).22 The lactone ring was then opened with O-tertbutylhydroxylamine in the presence of AlMe3 to give alcohol 19, which was converted into the corresponding bromide 20 using CBr4 and PPh3. Coupling to homocysteine through an SN2 reaction afforded the desired compound 21. Deprotection of the two benzyl groups proved to be problematic. A variety of

We found that the best reaction condition was boron trichloride in cold CH2Cl2,25 which not only completely removed the two benzyl groups but also cleaved the Boc and the two tert-butyl ester groups in the

Results and Discussion Compounds 10-12 and 16-18 were assayed against Co(II)substituted B. subtilis LuxS (Co-BsLuxS) by using SRH as the substrate and monitoring the release of Hcys with 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB).27 Compounds 10 and 11 acted as potent, competitive inhibitors (as determined with 10), with KI values of 0.72 and 0.37 µM, respectively (Figure 3 and Table 1). The same KI values were obtained for the native ferrouscontaining enzyme Fe-BsLuxS. To our knowledge, these are the most potent LuxS inhibitors that have so far been reported. They are, however, significantly weaker inhibitors against ZnBsLuxS (20 and 11 µM, respectively). They are also less potent against Co(II)-substituted Escherichia coli (Co-EcLuxS) and V. harVeyi (Co-VhLuxS) LuxS (Table 1). Interestingly, the KI values roughly correlated with the KM values of the various enzyme forms (against SRH); the enzymes with higher KM values also have higher KI values, suggesting that these compounds are good mimics of LuxS catalytic intermediate(s). Compound 12, which contains only the ribose portion, binds to LuxS with orders of magnitude lower affinity (KI g 150 µM), highlighting the importance of the amino acid moiety to the overall binding affinity. Likewise, methionine binds only weakly to the LuxS active site (KI ) 61 µM), indicating that binding

molecule, all in one step. To prepare compound 11, commercially available (-)-dimethyl 2,3-O-isopropylidene-L-tartrate (22) was treated with potassium hydroxide to hydrolyze one of the ester groups (Scheme 2).26 The resulting monocarboxylic acid was reduced with borane to afford alcohol 23. The alcohol was converted to bromide 24 with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine and coupled to Hcys to give methyl ester 25. Incubation with excess hydroxylamine converted the ester into hydroxamic acid 26, which was completely deprotected by treatment with TFA and 1 N HCl to afford compound 11. Compounds 13-15 were prepared from the corresponding mercapto carboxylic acids (Scheme 3). The thiol group was protected by oxidation into disulfide with hydrogen peroxide. The carboxyl group was then reacted with a properly protected lysine derivative to afford compounds 30-32, which were subsequently treated with TFA to generate the corresponding amino acids 33-35. The disulfides in 33-35 were reduced to free thiols 13-15 by tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine prior to inhibition assays. Compound 16 was synthesized as shown in Scheme 4. NR-Boc-Lys-O-tBu was reacted with p-methoxybenzaldehyde to form an imine intermediate, which was oxidized

to the metal center is also crucial for high affinity. On the other hand, the similar KI values of compounds 10 and 11 suggest that the central portion of the inhibitors (and likely substrates and intermediates) are not engaged in specific interactions with the enzyme, as we had anticipated. Compounds 13-15 could not be tested with the DTNB-based activity assay, because they contain free thiols in their structures. Their binding affinity to the LuxS active site was determined by taking advantage of the absorption spectral changes of the Co(II) center upon inhibitor binding. The Co(II) ion is very sensitive to changes to its environment and thus provides a convenient probe for ligand changes associated with inhibitor binding at the metal center.28 The free enzyme had a broad absorption peak between 500 and 600 nm and a sharper peak at 660 nm (Figure 4A). Addition of thiol 14 caused concentration-dependent spectral changes, resulting in the eventual loss of the above two peaks and the appearance of three sharp bands at 545, 630, and 695 nm. A plot of the absorbance at 695 nm as a function of inhibitor concentration gave a secondary plot as shown in Figure 4B. Curve fitting of the data gave a KD value of 155 µM for compound 14. The KD values of compounds 13 and 15 were similarly determined to be 132 and 473 µM, respectively. The drastic spectral changes suggest that the thiols (and possibly the carbonyl group as well) replaced the metalbound water in the free enzyme and became directly coordinated with the metal ion. Since the overall affinity is weak, we suspect that the amino acid moiety of these compounds did not fit into the homocysteine-binding pocket. Compound 16, which has a

bidentate N-formylhydroxylamine ligand, also exhibited weak inhibition, with a KI value of 68 µM (Table 1). This KI value is similar to that of methionine (KI ) 61 µM), suggesting that it might bind to the enzyme via its amino acid end. We also synthesized a series of compounds in which the thiol group of cysteine or homocysteine is covalently linked to a hydroxamate moiety via linkers of varying length (R. Liu and D. Pei, unpublished results). These compounds all showed only moderate inhibition of LuxS (KI values of 15-71 µM). -Ribosylornithine (17) and S-ribosylcysteine (18) were also tested as potential LuxS substrates and/or inhibitors. Compound 17 did not show any significant inhibition against LuxS in the DTNB assay. Prolonged incubation of high concentrations of 17 with Co-BsLuxS also failed to cause any spectral changes. Since the amino acid (ornithine) and ribose are connected through a C-C bond, DPD formation was not expected. Attempts to observe any 2- and/or 3-ketone intermediates by 13C NMR spectroscopy also failed. On the other hand, compound 18 (SRC) acted as a slow substrate of LuxS. Although its reactivity was too low to be quantitatively determined by the DTNB assay, treatment of 18 with LuxS in the presence of 1,2-phenylenediamine resulted in the formation of a quinoxaline derivative, indicating that DPD was released by the enzyme.16,29,32 When assayed as an inhibitor, SRC exhibited an apparent KI value of 70 µM. To gain insight into the structural basis of LuxS inhibition by the above compounds, Co-BsLuxS was cocrystallized with the inhibitors 10 and 11 from a solution of ammonium sulfate at pH 7.0. Crystals of both LuxS complexes are isomorphous with those of the 2-ketone intermediate 4 complex (PDB code 1YCL),21 and contain a LuxS dimer oriented along a 2-fold crystallographic axis, with one monomer per asymmetric unit. The active site is formed at the dimer interface. The structure with inhibitor 10 was refined at 1.8 Å resolution to an R factor of 19.4% and a free R factor of 22.6% (Table 2). The final model includes residues 4-157 of LuxS, 1 Co2+ ion, 138 water molecules, 2 sulfate ions, and 1 inhibitor molecule. The temperature factors for the protein atoms range from 11 to 45 Å2, while those for the inhibitor range from 19 to 24 Å2, indicating full occupancy of the inhibitor. The CR atoms of the structures of LuxS bound to 10 and 2-ketone intermediate 4 can be superimposed to an rmsd of 0.2 Å. There are no significant conformational changes in LuxS, even for side chains of residues at the active site. Clear electron density for inhibitor 10 allowed for it to be fit into the model unambiguously (Figure 5). Inhibitor 10 is bound to LuxS in a manner very similar to that of 2-ketone intermediate 4 (Figure 5C,E and Table 3). A significant difference lies in the interaction with the metal ion. While intermediate 4 binds monodentately to the metal ion via its C2 carbonyl oxygen, inhibitor 10 interacts with the Co2+ ion bidentately, through the oxygen atoms of both C2 carbonyl and C3 hydroxyl groups (metal-oxygen distances of 2.2 and 2.3 Å, respectively). The hydroxamate oxygen atom O1 is hydrogen bonded to the side chains of Arg-39 and His-11. The O1 atom does not however

interact directly with Ser-6, as was observed in the LuxS-ketone 4 complex, due to a change in the N1-C2 torsion angle imposed by its partial double bond character. The sulfhydryl group of catalytic residue Cys-84, which was replaced by alanine in the complex with intermediate 4, is proximal to the N1 (3.4 Å), C2 (3.5 Å), and C3 (4.1 Å) atoms of the inhibitor (Table 2). This is consistent with Cys-84 serving as a proton donor and acceptor to (and from) these atoms during the course of catalysis, as outlined in Figure 1. The C3 hydroxyl (O3) is hydrogen bonded to Glu-57, consistent with the role of Glu-57 as a general base during the carbonyl migration reactions (Figure 1). The C4 hydroxyl (O4) is hydrogen bonded to the Ser-6 side chain. The atoms of the homocysteine portion of the inhibitor are bound essentially the same as observed for the ketone 4 complex. Interestingly, a well-ordered water molecule, near the O2 atom of inhibitor 10 and forming hydrogen bonds with Ser-6 and His-11, is observed in both structures. Given the proximity of this water to the reactive groups of the protein and the inhibitor, it could conceivably have an important role during catalysis, presumably facilitating proton-transfer reactions. The structure of Co-BsLuxS was also determined in complex with inhibitor 11, and refined at 1.9 Å resolution to an R factor of 19.1% and a free R factor of 22.2% (Table 2 and Figure 5D). The electron density allowed for all atoms of inhibitor 11 to be placed in the structure unambiguously. Inhibitor 11 differs from inhibitor 10 only in having an inverted stereochemical configuration at the C4 position. This change is evident in the electron density map, although the density for the C4 and O4 atoms is slightly weaker than for the rest of the compound, indicating a higher degree of flexibility. Due to the change in configuration, the O4 atom of inhibitor 11 points down (as viewed in Figure 5D), and is closer to the Co2+ atom (3.5 Å) than is the case for the O4 atom of inhibitor 10 (5.2 Å). Thus, the structure of the complex with inhibitor 11 demonstrates that LuxS binds to substrate-related compounds with some degree of conformational variation at the C4 position. In comparing the structures of Co-BsLuxS bound to inhibitors 10, 11, and intermediate 4, it is apparent that LuxS binds to substrate-related

designing future generations of LuxS inhibitors, one may be able to employ a wide variety of linker structures to connect the amino acid and metal-chelating moieties. A conformationally constrained linker should be particularly effective. It is worth noting that both inhibitors 10 and 11 coordinate with the metal ion using the O2 and O3 atoms, instead of bidentate interaction via the hydroxamate (O1 and O2), as we had anticipated (Figure 2A). One possible reason for this is that binding via O1 and O2 would eliminate stable hydrogen-bonding interactions with Arg-39 and His-11. Alternatively, geometric constraints exerted by locking the homocysteine moiety into its binding pocket may prevent the planar hydroxamate from approaching the metal ion at an optimal distance/angle. This latter point may have important implications in LuxS catalytic mechanism. The planar hydroxamate closely mimics the enediolate intermediates, whose tighter binding to the metal ion would slow or prevent catalytic turnover. Conclusion A series of LuxS substrate and intermediate analogues have been synthesized and tested. This effort has led to the first submicromolar inhibitors against this enzyme. The cocrystal structures of LuxS bound with inhibitors 10 and 11 revealed that a high-affinity inhibitor should be able to bind to both the homocysteine-binding pocket and the metal ion and suggested possible strategies for designing future generations of LuxS inhibitors. The structures also provided additional evidence for the proposed roles of active-site residues (e.g., Glu-57 and Cys84 as general acids/bases) during catalysis. Experimental Section
General Procedures. Pfs and Co2+-, Zn2+-, or Fe2+-substituted LuxS from B. subtilis, E. coli, and V. harVeyi were overexpressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity as described previously.16 All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Unless otherwise noted, materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Triethylamine was dried under KOH; tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane, and diethyl ether were treated with the SOLV-TEK solvent purification system (Berryville, VA). DMF was dried with molecular sieves. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a 400 or 250 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer. Unless otherwise indicated, all NMR data were collected at room temperature in CDCl3 with internal CHCl3 as reference (7.26 ppm for 1H and 77.23 ppm for 13C), DMSO-d6 with internal DMSO as reference (2.49

ppm for 1H and 39.70 ppm for 13C), CD3OD with internal CH3OH as reference (3.30 ppm for 1H and 49.00 ppm for 13C), and D2O with H2O as reference (4.63 ppm for 1H). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on commercial silica gel 60 plates, 0.25 thickness, with a fluorescent indicator (F-254). Visualization was accomplished by UV light, staining with 5% phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol, or staining with KMnO4 in an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate. Column chromatography was performed with 32-63 µm silica gel. Solvents for chromatography were reagent grade and used as received. Mass spectra were performed with positive ion electrospray ionization or negative ion electrospray ionization. (2R,3R)-2,3-Bis(benzyloxy)-N-tert-butoxy-4-hydroxybutyramide (19).

Assay reactions were performed in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 150 µM DTNB, and varying concentrations of SRH and inhibitors at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by the addition of LuxS (final concentration of 0.2-0.4 µM) and monitored continuously at 412 nm ( ) 14150 M-1 cm-1) in a Perkin-Elmer 25 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The initial rates were calculated from the early regions of the progress curves (3 min for BsLuxS reactions and 30 s for VhLuxS and EcLuxS reactions). The remaining activity as a percentage was plotted against each inhibitor concentration to obtain IC50 values. The KI values were calculated from the equations V/V0 ) (KM + [S])/{KM (1 + [I]/KI) + [S]} and KI ) IC50/(1 + [S]/KM), where V and V0 are the reaction rates in the presence and absence of inhibitors, [S] and [I] are the concentrations of SRH and inhibitor, respectively, and KM is the Michaelis-Menten constant. UV-Vis Spectroscopy. Co-BsLuxS was diluted in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, and varying amounts of inhibitor to a final concentration of 49 µM. UV-vis spectra were recorded 5 min or 1 h after addition of the inhibitors at room temperature. The KI values were determined by fitting the absorbance increase A at a specific wavelength between 650 and 700 nm against the inhibitor concentration [I] using the equation A ) Amax[I]/(KI + [I]), where Amax is the maximal increase in absorbance at saturating concentrations of the inhibitor. Formation and Isolation of the DPD Derivative. For reactions that involve slow substrates or weakly active LuxS mutants, the DPD formed was converted into its quinoxaline derivative and isolated by HPLC.16,29,32 Briefly, 1 mM SRH, 5 mg/mL LuxS, and 1 mM 1,2-phenylenediamine were mixed in a pH 7 buffer and incubated for 24 h. Another equivalent of 1,2-phenylenediamine was then added, and the resulting solution was incubated at pH 4-5 for another 24 h followed by ethyl acetate extraction. The crude product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a semipreparative C18 column (Vydac) with a 30 min gradient of 10100% acetonitrile in water (monitored at 240 nm). The desired compound eluted at 12 min (40% acetonitrile). Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction. Co-BsLuxS was cocrystallized with inhibitors (compounds 10 and 11) by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The well solution consisted of 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0) and 2.2 M ammonium sulfate. LuxS protein (10 mg/mL) was mixed with 5.4 mM inhibitor, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 100 mM NaCl. The crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0), 2.5 M ammonium sulfate, 15% sucrose, and 5.4 mM inhibitor, mounted in nylon loops, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at -180 °C using a Rigaku RUH3RHB rotating anode generator and an R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector. The data were processed with CrystalClear software (Molecular Structure Corp.). Crystallographic refinement using CNS33 began with the structure of the BsLuxS 2-ketone intermediate complex (PDB code 1YCL) after removal of all water molecules, Co2+, and the 2-ketone intermediate. The conjugate gradient minimization and individual temperature factor protocols were used with a maximum likelihood target and overall anisotropic temperature factor and bulk solvent corrections to the data. The inhibitors were added to the model at the later stages of refinement after all of the protein atoms, Co2+, and several water molecules were positioned. Stereochemical parameters for refinement of the inhibitor were generated using the Dundee PRODRG2 server.34 Model building used the program O,35 and figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT36 and RASTER3D.37
