Structures of the deoxy and CO forms of haemoglobin from Dasyatis akajei, a cartilaginous ®sh
The three-dimensional structures of the deoxy- and carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin (Hb) from Dasyatis akajei, a stingray, Ê have been determined at 1.6 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively. This is one of the most distantly related vertebrate Hbs to human HbA. Both structures resemble the respective forms of HbA, indicating that the 22-type tetramer and the mode of the quaternary structure change are common to Hbs of jawed vertebrates. Larger deviations between D. akajei Hb and human HbA are observed in various parts of the molecule, even in the E and F helices. Signi®cant mutations and/or conformational changes are also observed around the haems, in the C-terminal region of the  subunit, in the 12 interface and in the organic phosphate-binding site of HbA. Despite these structural differences, the oxygen af®nity, haem±haem interaction, Bohr effect and organic phosphate effect of D. akajei Hb are all only moderately reduced. Compared with human HbA, the overall r.m.s. deviation of main-chain atoms in the helical regions of bony ®sh Hbs is smaller than that of D. akajei Hb.

1. Introduction
Since the three-dimensional structures of human and horse haemoglobins (Hbs) were determined, various properties of other vertebrate Hbs have been studied on the basis of these structures, assuming that tertiary and quaternary structures of Hbs of jawed vertebrates (with the exception of Agnatha) are all essentially the same (Perutz, 1983). X-ray crystallographic and molecular-evolutional studies have shown that the tertiary structure of globins is also conserved in invertebrates and is designated the globin fold (Lesk & Chothia, 1980; Bashfold et al., 1987). X-ray crystallography has shown that there are two quaternary structures, one liganded (Shaanan, 1983) and the other unliganded (Fermi et al., 1984). Both are assumed to be common among jawed vertebrate Hbs, which adopt one or the other structure depending on the presence of ligand at the haems (Baldwin & Chothia, 1979). The higher occurrence of invariant residues at the 12 and 11 interfaces compared with other surface regions of the subunits supports this assumption. The X-ray structures of the carbonmonoxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb of Pagothenia bernacchii, a bony ®sh, provided the ®rst structural evidence that the allosteric change in human Hb is common to vertebrates from mammals to bony ®sh (Camardella et al., 1992; Ito et al., 1995). X-ray structures for the CO and deoxy forms of a trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) Hb (Tame et al., 1996), the CO form of another bony ®sh (Leiostomus xanthurus) Hb (Mylvaganam et al., 1996) and the oxy form of bar-headed goose Hb (Zhang et al., 1996) are also available. All these structures adopt one or other of the previously described forms of human Hb. Here, we describe

the liganded and unliganded structures of Hb from a cartilaginous ®sh (Dasyatis akajei). This Hb is more distantly related to human Hb than any previously structurally characterized Hb. Although the overall structures of D. akajei Hb and human HbA are very similar, signi®cant structural differences were found in the functionally important regions. We discuss the properties of the protein in relation to its structure and compare it with Hb from bony ®sh.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Haemoglobin

Ê Resolution range (A)

Live ®sh (D. akajei) were obtained from Taniume, a ®sh dealer of the port of Minoshima in the Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Blood was collected from the vein near the heart using a heparinized syringe. The erythrocytes were washed three times in cold saline and lysed by the addition of three volumes of distilled water. The nucleic acid aggregate and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12 000g for 20 min. The supernatant was then applied to Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with 0.01 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer at pH 7.2 and loaded onto an ion-exchange column (Whatman DE-32) equilibrated with the same buffer. It was eluted with a linear salt gradient from 0.02 to 0.5 M. The main band was collected, concentrated and stored as the CO form at 193 K. The electrophoretic patterns of D. akajei haemolysate show the presence of a single major haemoglobin and two minor components (about 5% in total). The procedure described here removed these minor components. These minor components might be modi®ed forms of the main component, since we detected only one cDNA sequence, as described below.
2.2. cDNA sequence analysis

The  and  chain of D. akajei Hb were prepared by the methods of Suzuki & Nishikawa (1996). The N-terminal amino-acid sequences of the  and  chains were determined with an automated protein sequencer (Model 476A, Applied BioSystems). mRNA was isolated from the D. akajei erythrocytes with a FastTrack mRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). The single-stranded cDNA was synthesized with a Ready-To-Go T-Primed First-Strand Kit (Pharmacia) and puri®ed using a QIAquick PCR puri®cation Kit (QIAGEN). The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA from both the  and  chains of D. akajei Hb were determined using the methods of Suzuki et al. (1996). Three cDNAs from the  chain and four cDNAs from the  chain were analyzed and an identical result was obtained for each. The nucleotide-sequence data reported in this paper will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank nucleotide sequence databases with the accession numbers AB023722 ( chain) AB023723 ( chain).

In order to reduce methaemoglobin levels, catalase and superoxide dismutase were added to Hb samples (Lynch et al., 1976; Winterbourn et al., 1976). Deoxygenation curves were used to determine p50 (the oxygen partial pressure necessary to attain 50% saturation of Hb with oxygen) and the Hill coef®cient n (the maximum slope of Hill plots of oxygen equilibrium curves). 2 mM ATP was used as an organic phosphate effector.

nitrogen and carbon monoxide, respectively. The tubes were sealed with well ®tting rubber stoppers. Ammonium sulfate was used as the precipitant for crystallization of both the deoxy and CO forms. Deoxy crystals were obtained between 1.8 and 2.0 M at pH 6.5 and CO crystals were obtained between 2.1 and 2.3 M at the same pH using solution C described by Perutz (1968). The haemoglobin concentration for both deoxy- and CO-form crystallization was about 2%. The deoxy-Hb data set was collected at the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan using the Weissenberg camera (Sakabe, 1983). The HbCO data set was collected on an R-AXIS IIC imagingplate system mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating-anode generator at the Protein Research Center, Osaka University. The data were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Both structures were solved by the molecular-replacement method (Rossmann & Blow, 1962). The rotation-function and translation searches were carried out using X-PLOR

in neutral and acidic conditions, but the effect is smaller than the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) effect of human HbA (Imai, 1982). The oxygen af®nity and Bohr effect of Hb from D. sabina, another stingray, are similar to D. akajei Hb, but this protein shows no ATP effect and the Hill coef®cient at neutral pH is lower (Mumm et al., 1978). However, of the 14 N-terminal amino acids of the  subunit, only seven are identical to those of D. akajei Hb. Further comparisons are dif®cult without the complete primary sequence of the protein from D. sabina.

È using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) in the resolution range Ê 8.0±1.6 A, during which the R factor dropped from 47 to 29%. The restraining parameters used were those of Engh & Huber (1991). Several stages of re®nement was carried out using X-PLOR; after each round of re®nement, 2Fo À Fc maps and omit maps in the loop regions and N- and C-termini were calculated and manual adjustment was carried out with the program FRODO (Jones, 1978). Coordinates with electron density greater than 3' in Fo À Fc maps and 1' in 2Fo À Fc maps were designated as water molecules if the locations were reasonable for hydrogen bonding and the temperature factors Ê Ê were not greater than 50 A2 (70 A2 for the CO form). The initial model for an  dimer of the CO form was constructed from the deoxy form and an analogous procedure was adopted for the re®nement. Crystallographic and re®nement data are summarized in Table 1. Coordinates of human HbA (deoxy, 2hhb; CO, 2hco), P. bernacchii Hb (deoxy, 1hbh; CO, 1pbx) and trout Hb I (deoxy, 1out; CO, 1ouu) were taken from the Protein Data Bank (Abola et al., 1987).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Oxygen equilibrium properties

It has been concluded from the amino-acid sequence that cartilaginous ®sh Hbs are also tetrameric 22 Hbs (Dickerson & Geis, 1983). Despite the low sequence identity between D. akajei Hb and human HbA (about 39%) and the missing D helix in the  subunit of D. akajei Hb (see Fig. 3), their overall structures are very similar. In fact, the main-chain atoms of the D. akajei Hb tetramer superimpose Ê on those of HbA with an r.m.s. difference of 1.5 A in the deoxy Ê form and 1.7 A in the CO form (see Table 6). Fig. 1 shows the r.m.s. deviations of main-chain atoms by residue between D. akajei Hb and human HbA.1 The large Ê deviations (up to 6 A) around 50 are the result of the deletion of four residues in D. akajei Hb. Other insertions or deletions (one in the  subunit and two in the  subunit) cause Ê deviations of about 2±3.5 A, which are also seen in other regions. Relatively large changes in the A helix, CD corner and C-terminal residues are observed in other ®sh Hbs (Camardella et al., 1992; Mylvaganam et al., 1996) and are attributable to the ¯exible nature of these regions. The comparatively large deviations between the beginning of the E helix and the end of the F helix (especially in the  subunit) are peculiar to the stingray Hb. In this region of the  subunit, the r.m.s. deviations vary periodically in both the deoxy and CO forms (Fig. 1b). Along the E helix, external residues show larger r.m.s. deviations from HbA. These deviations of the E and F helices are discussed further below. Fig. 2 shows the r.m.s. deviation of main-chain atoms between 11 dimers of the CO and deoxy forms of D. akajei
The 11 interface (involving mainly the B, G and H helices of the two subunits) is relatively invariant (Baldwin & Chothia, 1979) and has been used as the frame for superpositions of different Hbs. The BGH core residues used for the superposition in this paper are the main-chain atoms of B5±B15, G4±G18, H3±H17 for both  and  subunits. The r.m.s. deviations of the superimposed main-chain atoms of D. akajei Hb and human HbA are 0.56 and Ê 0.57 A for the deoxy and CO forms, respectively. Acta Cryst. (1999). D55, 1291±1300

The oxygen equilibrium characteristics are presented in Table 2. D. akajei Hb shows a slightly lower oxygen af®nity than that of human HbA, with moderate haem±haem interaction, Bohr effect and ATP effect (Imai, 1982). The Bohr effect between pH 6.5 and pH 7.4 without organic phosphate was about 70% that of HbA. ATP reduces the oxygen af®nity

Ê Hb in the BGH frame (r.m.s. deviation 0.357 A). Baldwin & Chothia (1979) have performed similar calculations for human HbA. The most signi®cant deviations in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) start from the end of the E helix, rise to a maximum around the FG corner and tail off at the beginning of the G helix. HbA shows a similar pattern. Thus, the tertiary structure changes of 11 dimers upon CO binding are essentially the same for D. akajei Hb and human HbA.

GH3. The  chain also contains 141 residues, ®ve residues less than the  chain of human HbA; four residues from CD8 to D3 of HbA and one at FG2 are deleted. In the case of singleresidue deletions or insertions, two to three successive residues show distinctly different conformations, so deciding the precise position of the mutation is a matter of choice. We selected the second residue of the three as the deleted (or inserted) one. Sometimes deviation between two main chains at the selected site is smaller than those at both of the adjacent 3.3. The primary structure sites. In the case of the four-residue deletions in the  subunit, we selected the middle four residues of the six residues found Fig. 3 shows the primary structures of the  and  chains of with distinctly different conformations. As a result of this D. akajei Hb (determined from cDNA sequences) compared deletion, the D helix is missing from the  subunit of D. akajei with those of human HbA. The  chain, as in human HbA, Hb. Three other primary sequences for Hbs of cartilaginous contains 141 residues, but in the D. akajei Hb  chain an extra ®sh, Heterodontus portusjacksoni (Nash et al., 1976; Fisher et glutamic residue is present next to 49(CD7) (Ser for human al., 1977), Squalus acanthias (Aschauer et al., 1985) and HbA and Phe for D. akajei Hb) and one residue is deleted at Torpedo marmorata (Huber & Braunitzer, 1989), have been reported. In these Hbs, a single-residue insertion in the CD corner and a single-residue deletion in the GH corner in the  subunit in addition to a four- or ®ve-residue deletion in the  subunit are present in common. The D helix has also been deleted from the  subunit of HbA and reinserted into the  subunit by site-directed mutagenesis. Neither change greatly altered the oxygen equilibrium of the protein (Komiyama et al., 1991). The deletion of (FG2) seems unique to D. akajei Hb. The N-termini of the  chain for bony ®sh Hbs are usually acetylated, but the electron-density map of the D. akajei  subunit shows no indication of acetylation. This is consistent with the fact that the N-terminal amino-acid sequence could be readily determined Figure 4 using an automated protein sequencer.

3.4. Haem-group region

The alteration in haem geometry upon ligation of D. akajei Hb, which ¯attens and moves the Fe atom to an in-plane position, is very similar to

that of HbA (Table 3; Fermi et al., 1984). There are no signi®cant mutations in the haem region that would be expected to alter ligand af®nity directly. In D. akajei deoxy-Hb there is a water molecule in the  haem pocket, similar to that seen in the  subunit of human deoxy-Hb (Fermi et al., 1984). In the BGH reference frame, the haems in both the  and  subunits of D. akajei Hb move further into haem pocket in the Ê direction from pyrrole A to pyrrole C ($0.8 A for the  Ê for the  subunit). In human HbA, the subunit and $1.5 A subunit haem rotates $9 upon CO binding about an axis in the haem plane and perpendicular to the translational movement described above (pyrrole A moves to the distal side upon CO binding), whereas in the  subunit there is no such rotation (Baldwin & Chothia, 1979). On the other hand, in D. akajei Hb there are similar but smaller rotations of haems in both the  and  subunits. In order to highlight the relation between the displacement of haems and the deviations of the E helix, EF corner and F helix shown in Fig. 1(b), we calculated the r.m.s. deviations of these parts in the haem frame (superimposing porphyrins of two Hbs: four pyrroles and four methine C atoms) as well as in the BGH frame of the 11 interface (Table 4). Most of the r.m.s. deviations between D. akajei Hb and HbA become smaller on going from the BGH frame to the haem frame, indicating that the relative movement between haems and E helix, EF corner and F helix is smaller than their movement in the whole molecule. A marked reduction takes place in the CO form  subunit. In order to investigate the reduction in detail, a stereoscopic comparison of the -subunit region with the side chains of the distal and the proximal His in the BGH frame of the 11 interface is shown in Fig. 4. Relatively large structural differences between D. akajei Hb and HbA are seen around the  haems. On the distal side, the entire E helices in both the deoxy and CO forms of D. akajei Hb are displaced relative to those of human HbA. In Fig. 1(b), it is observed that the external residues are displaced more than the internal residues. Fig. 4 shows that the movement of the E helix includes a small rotation about an axis almost parallel to the helix axis, which displaces the external residues more. Close inspection shows that the displacements of side-chain atoms close to the haem are smaller than those of the C atoms to which they are attached (only the distal and proximal His are shown in Fig. 4). Comparison of displacements on the proximal side of the  haem is complicated by the deletion at the Figure 5 FG2 position in D. akajei Hb.

Chothia, 1979). In the haem frame, these displacements become much smaller. In the carbonmonoxy structures, the positions of the side chains of Val (E11), His (E7) and His (F8) are nearly identical in HbA and the stingray protein (Fig. 5a). In the deoxy form, the displacement of the distal Val (E11) 2 methyl group between D. akajei Hb and human HbA is Ê about 1 A (Fig. 5b), which reduces the movement of Val (E11) upon ligation of CO (Fig. 5c). The distances between the ligand O atom and the C atom of the 2 methyl group of Val Ê (E11) in the deoxy form in the haem frame are 1.6 and 2.6 A for human HbA and D. akajei Hb, respectively. Although the displacement of Val (E11) is much smaller in D. akajei Hb, it is still stereochemically important. The smaller movement of Val (E11) seems to correlate with the smaller tilting of the  haem upon CO ligation, as there is more room for the ligand in deoxy D. akajei Hb as a result of the deletion of the D helix, making the  subunit more -like. As suggested by the sequence, the structural changes in the  subunit (Table 4) are smaller than those in the  subunit, although some are still signi®cant. However, no changes are found among the haem-contact side chains that appear to be functionally important. In common with the  subunit, the mutations between HbA and the stingray protein alter the haem environment relatively little. Interestingly, the distal valine Val63 (E11) moves away about the same distance as that of the  subunit from the ligandbinding site upon CO binding in D. akajei Hb, whereas only a small movement was observed in human HbA (Shaanan, 1983). As noted above, this movement in the  subunits is more marked in the human protein.
3.5. a1b 1 contact region

Of the 33 residues participating in this contact tabulated by Fermi & Perutz (1981) for deoxy-HbA, only 16 are found unaltered in D. akajei Hb. From Fig. 1 it can be seen that these changes have not altered the relative position of the subunits within the  dimer. Pro 119(H2) is an important residue at the 11 contact in human HbA; it is highly conserved among vertebrate Hbs and lies close to 55(D6), a methionine in HbA. It is replaced by alanine in Hb from the high-¯ying barheaded goose, which has been correlated with a higher oxygen af®nity (Zhang et al., 1996). Loss of the  D helix greatly alters the contact, as the path of the polypeptide chain is shifted. Gly 29(B11) of HbA is mutated to Glu in D. akajei Hb and occupies the space ®lled by Met 55(D6) in HbA. Although Ê the closest approach of 119(H2) and 29(B11) is about 4.4 A Ê (compared with a distance of about 3.8 A between the proline and methionine of HbA) it seems that Glu 29(B11) replaces this contact.
3.6. a1b 2 contact region

The 12 (21) contact involves mainly the C helix, G helix and FG corner, and is termed the sliding contact, since it undergoes the largest relative movement between deoxy Hb and HbCO. The movement can be approximated as a rigidbody rotation of the 22 dimer relative to the 11 dimer by 15 about a pivot passing through the  subunits. The contact between the  FG corner and  C helix is called the ¯exible joint because it is near the pivot point and is relatively unchanged on ligand binding, while the contact between the  FG corner and  C helix is called the switch region because it is further away from the pivot point and slides extensively (Baldwin & Chothia, 1979). In the switch region of deoxy human HbA, Thr41 1(C6) sits between His97 2(FG4) and Asp99 2(G1) but is replaced in the CO form by Thr38 1(C3). In D. akajei Hb, FG4 is mutated to Gly and C3 to Gln. Fig. 6(a) shows the structural differences in the switch region by superimposing the main-chain atoms in the 1 C helix of D. akajei deoxy-Hb on those of deoxyHbA. The displacement of the 2 FG corner of D. akajei deoxy-Hb from deoxy-HbA is apparent: FG4 and G1 residues of D. akajei Ê Hb are displaced about 1.9 A from those of HbA in the direction from 41 to 38. However, in D. akajei deoxy-Hb Thr41 1(C6) is still between Gly92 2(FG4) and Asp94 2(G1).

The key intersubunit hydrogen bonds previously identi®ed as important in maintaining the allosteric equilibrium are all preserved in D. akajei Hb (Table 5; Dickerson & Geis, 1983; Ishimori et al., 1992).
3.7. Bohr effect

The chloride-independent part of the Bohr effect of HbA largely arises from the -subunit C-terminal residue His146(HC3), which forms salt bridges with Asp94(FG1) in 1 2 D. akajei Human ² the same subunit through the imidazole group and with Asp G1 Asn G4 3.0 2.8 Lys40(C5) across the 12 contact through its carboxyl group (Perutz et al., 1998).

Fig. 7 shows the Fo À Fc electron-density map for D. akajei deoxy-Hb, in which Asn139 (HC1), Tyr140 (HC2), His141 (HC3) and Gln89 (F9) C helix upon CO binding. It is obvious that the essential were omitted for the calculation of the electron density. The sliding mechanism in the switch region is maintained. The imidazole of the C-terminal His is not oriented towards Glu90 substitution of Gly for His (FG4) may have been selected to (FG1), but instead forms a hydrogen bond with the relieve steric strain with 1(C6) in the deoxy form and 1(C3) -carbonyl group of Asn139 (HC1).

Thus, it is possible to attribute some of the Bohr effect to the hydrogen bond between the imidazole group of His 141(HC3) and Asn 139(HC1) in the deoxy form. Hb from T. marmorata, another ray, shows no Bohr effect. In the  chain of this Hb, both F9 and HC1 are occupied by Gln, FG1 is Lys and HC3 is His (Huber & Braunitzer, 1989). Although a similar arrangement for the  C-terminal region of D. akajei Hb is possible, the changes at HC1 and FG1 appear to suppress the chloride-independent Bohr effect. Similarly, Hb from the shark Selachii acanthias shows a Bohr effect less than half ($40%) that of human HbA in the absence of chloride (Weber et al., 1983). In the  subunit of this Hb, F9 is Tyr, FG1 is Glu, HC1 is Gly and HC3 is His.

A novel 1±2 interaction was identi®ed for the CO form of D. akajei Hb. The side chain of Arg130 (H13) is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain carbonyl groups of Ser137(H20) and Tyr140(HC) of the other  subunit. Although the sidechain atoms have higher B factors than average, this structure was con®rmed in the omit map, where the side-chain atoms were excluded from the structure-factor calculation.
3.9. Comparison of the structures of cartilaginous ®sh, bony ®sh and human HbA

Hbs are therefore consistent with the structure of D. akajei Hb. In the  C-terminal region, the structure of D. akajei deoxy-Hb and human HbA are very similar. Slightly larger changes appear between the CO forms, but none of them appear to be functionally signi®cant. One conspicuous feature of D. akajei Hb is Tyr 134 (Thr in HbA) situated near the molecular dyad axis and parallel with the symmetry-related equivalent tyrosine from the other  subunit. These two phenol groups form an aromatic stacking interaction, lying Ê about 3.5 A apart. In the CO form, together with two C-terminal Args, these two Tyrs effectively plug the central cavity.

3.8. Organic phosphate-binding sites

ATP lowers the oxygen af®nity of D. akajei Hb (Table 2). A model for the binding site of ATP in bony ®sh Hbs has been proposed (Perutz & Brunori, 1982; Perutz, 1983). In this model, the same residues [Lys (EF6), His (H21), His (NA2) and  N-terminal -amino group] used for human HbA to bind 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) participate in the binding of ATP. In bony ®sh Hb, Glu or Asp is substituted for His at NA2 and Arg for His at H21, but the former can be modelled to accept a hydrogen bond from adenine and the latter to participate in the binding of phosphate. In D. akajei Hb, however, EF6 is Glu, H21 is Ser and NA2 is Lys. Thus the organic phosphate-binding site corresponding to that of human deoxy-HbA cannot bind ATP. We have searched for other polyanion-binding sites in D. akajei deoxy-Hb along the molecular dyad and found in the central cavity, just inside the DPG-binding site of deoxy HbA, a pair of positive charges on the 4 amino group of Lys 99(G6) and the guanidinium group of Arg 130(H13) (separated by Ê about 3.6 A between N4 and C). The distance between the Ê symmetry-related Lys N4 atoms is about 11.4 A and the Ê shortest distance between the Arg side chains is about 8.9 A. This space is squeezed upon CO binding as is the DPGbinding site. The closest distance between the H helices is the Ê distance between the C atoms of Glu134 (H17): 13.3 A in D. Ê in the CO form. Although we have akajei deoxy-Hb and 8.5 A not attempted to model ATP into the structure, this site is a possible candidate for an ATP-binding site of D. akajei Hb.

The pairwise r.m.s. deviations of main-chain atoms in the helical portions of human HbA, P. bernacchii Hb, trout Hb I and D. akajei Hb in both the deoxy and CO forms are presented in Table 6. Naturally, the r.m.s. deviations between the two bony ®sh Hbs are small, because they are genealogically closely related. The sequence identity between them is about 56%. D. akajei Hb differs more than the bony ®sh Hbs from human HbA. This agrees with our observations that structural differences in various regions of D. akajei Hb are apparently larger than those described for P. bernachii Hb (Camardella et al., 1992; Ito et al., 1995) and for trout Hb I (Tame et al., 1996). On the other hand, the r.m.s. distances of the two bony ®sh Hbs are similar to that of human HbA when referred to D. akajei Hb. Very similar relations are found for the superposition of the CO-form tetramers. Thus, the r.m.s. distances in Table 6 are consistent with both the genealogical separation of the animals and the sequence similarity of their Hbs. We have not analyzed the structure differences among vertebrate Hbs further, because we think that further structure determinations of Hbs which diverged in the early stage of vertebrate evolution are necessary.

4. Conclusions
Although there are structural differences in various parts of D. akajei Hb and human HbA, the two Hbs are functionally similar and the basic nature of the quaternary structure change upon CO binding are the same. On the other hand, the mechanism of the Bohr effect and organic phosphate effect seem to be different. These facts show marked contrast to the results obtained for functionally abnormal mutant human Hbs. Some of them show very high oxygen af®nity by only a single amino-acid substitution per  dimer, yet in most cases the crystal structures are unchanged except around the mutated position. Thus, we are led to conclude that there are many functional compensations in the amino-acid substitutions which reach up to 60% of the total sequence between D. akajei Hb and human HbA, and that the evolution of the function of Hb is a result of many compensating mutations.
