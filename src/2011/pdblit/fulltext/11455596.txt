ABSTRACT To understand the role of non-Gly residues in the left-handed helical conformation for the conformational stability of a protein, the nonGly to Gly and Ala mutations at six left-handed residues (R21, Y38, R50, Q58, H78, and N118) of the human lysozyme were examined. The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter, and the crystal structures were analyzed by X-ray crystallography. If a left-handed non-Gly had an unfavorable steric interaction between the sidechain C and backbone, the Gly mutation would be expected to stabilize more than the Ala mutation at the same position. For the mutant human lysozymes, however, there were few differences in the denaturation Gibbs energy ( G) between the Gly and Ala mutants, except for the substitution at position 58. Analysis of the changes in stability ( G) based on the structures of the wild-type and mutant proteins showed that the experimental G value of Q58G was 7 kJ/mol higher than the estimated value without consideration of any local steric interaction. These results indicate that only Q58G increased the stability by elimination of local constraints. The residue 58 is located at the most rigid position in the left-handed non-Gly residues and is involved in its enzymatic function. It can be concluded that the left-handed non-Gly residues do not always have unfavorable strain energies as compared with Gly at the same position. Proteins 2001; 44:233­243. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: differential scanning calorimetry; X-ray crystallography; mutant protein; Gibbs energy; Ramachandran map; local constraints INTRODUCTION It has been known for nearly four decades that the ( , ) values of amino acid residues in protein structures are usually inside three preferred regions: right-handed helical, extended, and left-handed helical regions on the Ramachandran map.1 More than 95% of the non-glycine (non-Gly) residues fall within these regions.2,3 A large majority of the non-Gly residues, however, adopt the ( , ) values that correspond to the right-handed helical or extended regions. The right-handed and extended confor©

mations form characteristic secondary structures, -helix and -strand, respectively, while the left-handed conformation plays roles in terminating the secondary structures and effecting chain reversals. In the left-handed helical region, 60% of the residues are populated by Gly, and the others are non-Gly.4 It has been postulated that the high proportion of Gly residues is because the non-Gly residues have unfavorable energies from the local steric interaction of backbone atoms with the side-chain C atom. This means that a substitution of the left-handed non-Gly to Gly would be expected to stabilize the protein. However, there are only a few reports on such mutations for left-handed helical conformations.5­7 Moreover, the results are different from each other; the replacement of Lys95 with Gly in RNase H stabilizes the protein at 7.9 kJ/mol,6 while N55G and K124G mutants of the T4 lysozyme are marginally less stable than the wild-type protein.5 These results strongly suggest that data obtained from a series of mutant proteins substituted by Gly at the non-Gly positions in the left-handed helical region should be accumulated and examined on the basis of their structural features, in order to elucidate the role of the left-handed non-Gly in protein stability. A Ramachandran plot1 of the human lysozyme8 is shown in Figure 1. Most residues are in the extended (around 100° and 120°), right-handed helical (around 75° and 50°) or left-handed helical (around 60° and 30°) regions. In the left-handed region, there are six non-Gly residues: Arg21, Tyr38, Arg50, Gln58, His78, and Asn118. In this study, we have examined six non-Gly to Gly mutants of the human lysozyme: R21G, Y38G, R50G, Q58G, H78G, and N118G. Furthermore, we have constructed six non-Gly to Ala mutant proteins, R21A, Y38A, R50A, Q58A, H78A, and N118A, to correct the stability changes of the Gly mutants for effects from side-chain atoms other than the C atom. If a left-handed non-Gly had an unfavorable steric interaction between the

side-chain C and backbone, the Gly mutation would be expected to stabilize more than the Ala mutation at the same position. The substitution residues in the native structure are shown in Figure 2, and their structural features are listed in Table I. We examined the stability and structures of the 12 mutant human lysozymes by calorimetry and X-ray crystal analysis. The effects of the substitutions of the non-Gly residue in the left-handed helical conformations on the conformational stability of a protein will be discussed on the basis of the structures of the mutant proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mutant Proteins Mutagenesis, expression, and purification of the mutant human lysozymes examined in this study were performed as described.8 All chemicals were reagent grade. The protein concentration of the mutant proteins, except for Y38G and Y38A, was spectrophotometrically determined using E1%(1 cm) 25.65 at 280 nm.9 The protein concentration of Y38G and Y38A was determined using E1%(1 cm) 24.62 at 280 nm with a correction.10

Differential Scanning Calorimetry Calorimetric measurements were carried out with a DASM4 microcalorimeter. The sample buffer was 0.05 M Gly-HCl. Each protein was measured three or four times at different pH points between pH 2.4 and 3.3. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data analysis was done using the Origin software (MicroCal, MA) as previously described.8 The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation as a function of temperature were calculated using the following equations: HT ST GT H Td H Td /Td HT Cp Td T (1) (2) (3)

The mutant human lysozymes examined in this study were crystallized at pH 4.5 as previously described.8 ­12 All the crystals belong to the space group P212121 with a crystal form identical to that of the wild-type protein.8 The

Using these data and equations 1­3, the thermodynamic parameters for the denaturation of the mutant and wild-type proteins at the same temperature, 64.9°C, which is the denaturation temperature of the wild-type protein at pH 2.7,8 were calculated as shown in Table III. R21G was stabilized by 4.8 kJ/mol, compared with the wild-type protein, but the stability change of R21G was also similar to that of R21A ( G 5.5 kJ/mol). In contrast, both the Gly and Ala substitutions at Tyr38 destabilized the protein by 10 kJ/mol. The stabilities of both the Gly and Ala mutants of R50, H78, and N118 were essentially equivalent to that of the wild-type protein. In the case of position 58, both mutations enhanced the stability, but Q58G was more stable than Q58A. Table III also shows the differences in stability between the Gly and Ala mutants at the same position, GAla3 Gly. These values denote the effect of an Ala to Gly mutation on protein stability, which were nearly zero, except for that at position 58. Crystal Structures of the Mutant Human Lysozymes

crystal structures of R50G, Q58G, and H78G have already been determined.13,14 Intensity data sets of the mutant human lysozymes were collected at the Photon Factory on beam lines 6A and 18B with a Weissenberg camera15 (Tsukuba, Japan; Proposal No. 99G099) for Y38G and H78A, respectively, and at the SPring-8 on beam line 40B2 with a Rigaku Raxis IV (Harima, Japan; Proposal No. 2000A0346-CL-np) for R21G, R21A, Q58A, N118G, and N118A. The data were processed with the program DENZO16 for Y38G and H78A and with the software provided by Rigaku (Tokyo, Japan) for R21G, R21A, Q58A, N118G, and N118A. The structures were solved by the isomorphous method and refined with the program X-PLOR17 as previously described.8,12 The crystals of the Y38A human lysozyme are very small. The intensity data set of the Y38A mutant human lysozyme was collected at the SPring-8 on beam line 41XU (Harima, Japan; Proposal No. 2000A0345-NL-np). The resolution of the Y38A data collected, however, was low ( 2.8 Å); therefore, we stopped the structural determination of Y38A. A crystal of R50A has not been obtained. RESULTS DSC Measurements of the Mutant Human Lysozymes To measure the changes in the conformational stability of the mutant human lysozymes, we examined the heat denaturation of the mutant proteins by DSC. The DSC measurements were carried out in the acidic pH region (pH 2.4 ­3.3), where the heat denaturation of the human lysozyme is highly reversible. Table II shows the denatur-

To investigate the structural changes due to mutation, we determined the crystal structures of the mutant human lysozymes by X-ray analysis. The data collection and refinement statistics of the mutant proteins are summarized in Table IV. The overall structures of the examined mutant proteins were similar to that of the wild-type protein. However, when examining the relationship between the changes in stability and molecular structures caused by mutations, subtle changes attributable to the rearrangements of the overall structure should also be considered.18 The backbone structures around the mutation site in the mutant structures were apparently unchanged, except for R50G, in which there is a small difference in the turn conformation between the wild-type and mutant proteins.14 The superimposed structures of the wild-type, Gly mutant and Ala mutant proteins in the vicinity of each mutation site for positions 58, 78, and 118 are illustrated in Figure 3. Although the backbone conformations are similar to each other, there were subtle differences in the ( , ) values of the mutation residues. Figure 4 shows the ( , ) plots of the mutation residues in the wild-type structure and each mutant structure. Each Gly residue has both a larger value and a smaller value than those of the corresponding non-Gly residues. These observations have also been reported in the N55G T4 lysozyme5 and K95G RNase H.19 This is because a non-Gly residue in the left-handed region would have a closer contact between its C and the carbonyl oxygen in the preceding residue (n 1) when the and values move to larger and smaller values, respectively.5 Other structural changes due to the mutation were observed in the R21G, R21A, and Y38G structures. Figures 5 and 6 show the structures in the vicinity of each mutation site at positions 21 and 38,

with the protein atoms and water molecules. Although the Y38A structure has not been determined, it might have some additional water molecules like Y38G. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under PDB file names R21G, 1GDW; R21A, 1GDX; Y38G, 1GE0; Q58A, 1GE1; H78A, 1GE2; N118G, 1GE3; and N118A and 1GE4. DISCUSSION Effect of Non-Gly to Gly Mutations in the LeftHanded Helical Conformations on Protein Stability Various energy calculations suggest that a left-handed Gly residue is almost as favorable as a right-handed one because Gly lacks the C atom and is symmetric nature.20,21 Analysis of the folded structures of the proteins shows that Gly residues can equally occur in both the leftand right-handed conformations.22­24 In contrast, the conformational energy of a left-handed helical non-Gly residue is considered to be less by 6 kJ/mol than that of a right-handed one,21,25­27 resulting in only a sparse population of non-Gly in the left-handed conformation.23 If the left-handed non-Gly residues have more unfavorable energies than the left-handed Gly residues do, an increase in protein stability could then be expected by replacing a left-handed non-Gly residue with Gly. Kimura et al.6 have proposed a strategy to enhance the protein stability by substitution of a left-handed non-Gly residue with Gly. For the left-handed non-Gly residues in the human lysozyme, two non-Gly to Gly mutant proteins, R21G and Q58G, enhanced the thermostability by 4.8 and 7.8 kJ/mol, respectively, in G (Table III). However, the stability of R21G was equivalent to that of R21A, suggesting that the C of Arg21 did not cause steric hindrance but other effects would stabilize R21G, and also R21A. In contrast, the substitutions of Tyr38 to Gly and Ala decreased the stability by 10 kJ/mol. Because the side-chain of Tyr38 is mostly buried in the interior of the protein (Table I) and forms a hydrogen bond (Fig. 6), the side-chain of Tyr38 itself might seriously contribute to the stability. The GAla3 Gly values were nearly zero, except for position 58 (Table III). These results indicate that the substitutions of the left-handed non-Gly residue to Gly in the human lysozyme, except for Q58G, did not stabilize the protein by

respectively. In the mutant structures, new water molecules are found in spaces where each side-chain of the mutation residues was occupied in the wild-type structure. These water molecules form a hydrogen bond network

elimination of the C atoms. Therefore, to identify suitable sites is indispensable for enhancing protein stability by left-handed non-Gly to Gly mutations. Estimation of the Stability Changes Due to Mutation Based on the Changes in Structure Comparing the stability between the Gly and Ala mutants suggests that left-handed non-Gly residues in the human lysozyme do not have unfavorable local interactions of the C atom with backbone atoms, except for position 58. However, amino acid substitutions affect

various factors that contribute to the stabilization of the protein structure, such as the hydrophobic interaction. To understand the intrinsic effect of the local interaction of the left-handed non-Gly residues, it is necessary to estimate the stability changes caused by the mutations based on the differences between the wild-type and mutant structures. In the present case, all mutant proteins would affect the hydrophobic interaction18,28; the mutant proteins substituted at a buried site (Y38G/A and Q58G/A) changed the side-chain conformational entropy of a mutation residue in

the denatured state; and the Gly mutant proteins changed the backbone entropy of a mutation residue in the denatured state.29 Furthermore, the crystal structures of R21G, R21A, and Y38G revealed that new water molecules and hydrogen bond networks appeared in the mutation site (Figs. 5, 6). Because a water molecule and a hydrogen bond affect protein stability,12,30 ­34 the stability changes in R21G, R21A, and Y38G should include the effects of such water molecules and hydrogen bonds. Changes in stability due to mutation ( Gest) could be expressed by equation 432,34: Gest GHP Gent GHB GH2O Gother (4) where GHP, Gent, GHB, GH2O, and Gother represent the changes in G due to a hydrophobic effect, the side-chain or backbone conformational entropy of mutation residue, forming and removing hydrogen bonds, introducing water molecules, and the contribution of other effects to stability, respectively.

The large difference in Q58G between them might be compensated by considering the effect of local steric strain. On the other hand, this result also indicates that the other left-handed

non-Gly positions have little local steric hindrance between the C and backbone atoms. Local Steric Strain of Left-Handed Non-Gly at Position 58 in Human Lysozyme Analysis of the changes in stability ( G) based on the structures of the wild-type and mutant proteins shows that Q58G increases the stability due to the elimination of the local constraint of the C atom, but the other lefthanded non-Gly positions have little unfavorable local energies. Here, the question is why only position 58 is constrained. This may be because residue 58 is located in the rigid region in the folded structure of the human lysozyme. Both the side-chain and backbone of Gln58 are almost buried in the interior of the structure, the backbone forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond within a turn structure between two -strands (Fig. 2), and the average B-factor of the backbone Gln58 is the lowest in the left-handed non-Gly residues of the human lysozyme (Table I). A theoretical study has shown that in the left-handed helical region, the energy penalty due to steric hindrance of the C atom with the backbone in a flexible model

polypeptide is much smaller than that expected on the basis of a rigid model structure.36 This means that there is little local steric strain in the flexible regions of a lefthanded non-Gly residue. A mutant N55G T4 lysozyme at the left-handed non-Gly position located in a highly mobile segment is not stabilized,5 whereas K95G RNase H increases the stability whose backbone in the wild-type protein is fixed by a hydrogen bond network.19 As pointed out by Nicholson et al.,5 there is little agreement among the theoretical calculations about the magnitude of the energetic cost for left-handed non-Gly conformation relative to Gly with the same ( , ) values. The energy difference in the theoretical estimations ranges from 0 to 20 kJ/mol.5 This might be produced in part from the difference in the rigidity of the examined polypeptide chains. Another question concerns why position 58 in the human lysozyme is not glycine, but rather glutamine. The DSC measurement showed that the Gly mutant protein (Q58G) was 8 kJ/mol in G more favorable than the wild-type protein (Gln at residue 58) (Table III). Here, Gln58 is a substrate-binding residue,37 and the Q58G

human lysozyme displayed little enzymatic activity in the catalytic properties against Micrococcus lisodeikticus. At the active site residue Glu49 in the tryptophan synthase -subunit, all mutant proteins have been reported to be more stable than the wild-type protein in the alkaline region.38 It has also been shown that mutations at the substrate-binding sites of the T4 lysozyme reduce the enzymatic activity but increase the thermal stability.40 Thus, Gln58 of the human lysozyme is important for function, although it requires some energy cost to be there.

Role of Left-Handed Residues in the Stability and Structure of a Protein In the left-handed helical region, 60% of the residues are populated by Gly,4 suggesting that the non-Gly residues have unfavorable energies from the local steric interaction of the backbone atoms with the side-chain C atom, as compared with Gly at the same position. However, 40% of the left-handed helical conformations are still non-Gly residues.4 This finding also suggests that left-handed non-Gly residues do not always have unfavor-

able strain energies, because a protein structure should have a high stability penalty if all the left-handed non-Gly residues had unfavorable energies. The present study shows that the human lysozyme actually has an unfavorable steric interaction between the side-chain C and backbone only at position 58 among the six sites. This result means that there are both unfavorable and favorable sites for the non-Gly residue in the left-handed helical conformations, and also we have a chance to stabilize a protein by the left-handed non-Gly to Gly mutations at the rigid sites. On the other hand, the left-handed Gly positions in the native protein structure might be more unfavorable sites for the non-Gly residue than the lefthanded non-Gly positions in the native protein structure. This is confirmed by Stites et al.,7 reporting that the average GAla3 Gly value of the mutations at the lefthanded non-Gly positions in the staphylococcal nuclease is only 0.9 kJ/mol, but the average GGly3 Ala value at the Gly positions is 8.2 kJ/mol. Furthermore, we are studying a series of left-handed Gly to Ala mutants of human lysozyme as a next project. This experiment will suggest whether left-handed Gly positions in native protein structures are more unfavorable sites for non-Gly residues than left-handed non-Gly positions in native protein structures.
