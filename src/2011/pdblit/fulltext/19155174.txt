Abstract--From HTS lead 1, a novel benzoisoquinolinone class of ATP-competitive Chk1 inhibitors was devised and synthesized via a photochemical route. Using X-ray crystallography as a guide, potency was rapidly enhanced through the installation of a tethered basic amine designed to interact with an acidic residue (Glu91) in the enzyme pocket. Further SAR was explored at the solvent front and near to the H1 pocket and resulted in the discovery of low MW, sub-nanomolar inhibitors of Chk1. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite their inherent toxicity, DNA damaging agents continue to remain central in clinical cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, strategies directed at improving their therapeutic index are warranted. Following DNA damage, normal cells arrest and attempt repair at the cell cycle checkpoints G1 and S, via the tumor suppressor protein p53, and at G2 and S via the checkpoint kinase Chk1.1­3 Tumor cells, however, are often deficient in p53 function (estimated 50­70% of all cancers) and thus, must rely on Chk1 to induce arrest for survival. These p53-deficient cancers should be more vulnerable to Chk1 inhibition, leading to abrogation of DNA-damage-induced arrest, premature progression into mitosis and resulting in mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. To summarize, abrogation of the S and G2 checkpoints should sensitize p53-deficient cancer cells to DNA damaging agents without enhancing toxicity toward normal proliferating cells. As such, Chk1 inhibitors4 have the potential to widen the therapeutic window for cliniKeywords: Chk1 kinase; Chek1 kinase; Kinases; Photochemistry; Benzoisoquinolinones; PSA; DNA damaging agents; Mitotic arrest; Checkpoint escape; p53-Deficient cancer; Cancer; Apoptosis. * Corresponding author.

cally-utilized DNA damaging agents in p53 deficient tumors. This effort initiated with the tetracyclic lead (1) that was derived from an earlier Jak kinase effort at Merck.5 An X-ray crystal structure was obtained for 1 and revealed the expected interaction of the hydrogen bond donor/ acceptor pair of the pyridone with the kinase backbone in the hinge region of the ATP active site. The 3-pyridyl analog 3 demonstrated that some enhancement in potency might be obtained by extension of a basic amine in the region of the Glu91 and Glu134 residues in the ATP pocket of Chk1. One concern in this structure was the presence of the imidazole group (calcd pKa for benzimidazole 5.8) which contributed elevated polar surface area (PSA) while likely not contributing to potency. Earlier studies suggested that elevated PSA and multiple basic sites in Chk1 inhibitors were detrimental to cell potency.6 In keeping with these observations, a strategy emerged to remove the imidazole from 1, therein producing a novel benzoisoquinolinone core that had the potential to be elaborated further to make key potency-enhancing contacts (Fig. 1).

Further analysis of the X-ray structure of 1 suggested the placement of a basic amine approximately 4­5 angstroms from C6 of the benzoisoquinolinone core would interact with the acidic residue Glu91 and would result in greater potency. Accordingly, it was decided to devise a general synthetic route that could access both an ethylamine and propylamine substitution at C6 from a common starting material (Schemes 1 and 2). Stobbe-condensation of substituted benzonitriles 4 with pyridine-4-carboxaldehyde 5 yielded the E-azastillbenes 6 in moderate yield.7 A key step in this synthesis was the oxidative photocyclization of 6 to the azaphenanthrene 7. While slow and somewhat low-yielding (30%), this reaction was run reproducibly on 80 g scale, used O2(g) as an oxidant, and did not require high dilution. In addition, upon concentration the pure product 7 precipitated from the reaction mixture and was easily isolated. The presence of t-BuOH was found to accelerate the reaction consistent with an earlier observation.8 Elaboration of the C6­CN group into primary alcohol (9) was accomplished in three high-yielding steps: (1) hydrolysis to the acid, (2) Fisher esterification to the ester and (3) reduction using LAH. The alcohol was then oxidized to the aldehyde 10. Despite efforts to shorten the sequence from 7 to 10, no simplified route was identified. Importantly, however, no chromatography was required for these first 6 steps. Homologation of the aldehyde 10 to the acrylonitrile 11 and subsequent 1,4-reduction with NaBH4 gave the C6-ethylnitrile 12. At this stage, N-oxidation with m-CPBA and regioselective rearrangement to the pyridone provided benzoisoquinolinone 14. The regioselectivity of this transformation is rationalized by resonance arguments that maintain the aromaticity of the naphthalene core. After considerable experimentation, it was found that LAH provided the optimal conditions for reduction of the nitrile to the primary amine 15. In the sequence for which X = Br, Suzuki couplings with various boronic acids allowed for exploration of the C9 SAR (results reported below). Alternatively, the intermediate alcohol 9 could be directed toward the formation of the C6-ethylamine benzoisoquinolinones 22 (Scheme 2). Again, regioselective conversion to the pyridone 18 was strictly observed.

Conversion to the primary mesylate 19 was followed by direct displacement with NaCN to provide the nitrile 20. Here, LAH was found to lead to significant decomposition whereas BH3­THF provided clean reduction to the ethylamine 21. Again, for the C9­Br, metal-mediated coupling reactions allowed for exploration at C9. The final vector that was explored in this benzoisoquinolinone core emanated from the C4-position. Substitution at C4 would extend into the H1 pocket9 and surrounding hydrophobic space that is left unused by HTS lead 1. The reactivity of the pyridone moiety (even in the presence of the pyrazole) in these benzoisoquinolinones allowed for late-stage bromination at C4 and further Suzuki-couplings to determine the effect of extending substitution into that region (Scheme 3). These benzoisoquinolinone inhibitors proved to be excellent structural surrogates for the HTS lead 1 and through this versatile synthetic route, superior enzymatic and

cellular-potency were achieved in structures with low molecular weight (MW <300). In Table 1, a comparison of C6 substitutions establishes that the benzoisoquinolinone core is potent and that both the ethyl- and propyllinked amines provide excellent potency enhancement. The core itself with a C9­Cl group (25) gave an IC50 = 580 nM against Chk1 confirming that the imidazole was not needed for potency.10 Various neutral substitutions (26­31) did not greatly alter potency, however, both the propyl amine (32 and 33) and the ethyl amine (34 and 35) provided approximately 30-fold improvements in potency relative to 25. This potency enhancement is lost completely by replacement of the amine with an alcohol (36), and is even diminished with mono(38) and bismethylation (39) of the amine. These observations are consistent with an ionic interaction between a

With either a propyl- or ethylamine at C6, exploration of C9 commenced (Table 2). Substitutions at C9 are directed toward the solvent front of the Chk1 ATP-binding pocket and those substitutions that would form beneficial interactions in this environment while mini° mizing molecular PSA <100 A2 were sought out to maximize cellular potency. These inhibitors were tested against the enzyme and also in a cell-based checkpoint escape assay that measures the ability of a Chk1 inhibitor to release H1299 tumor cells from camptothecin-induced cell cycle arrest.11,12 The C9­Br derivative 32 or Cl derivative 33 gave approximately a 7-fold improvement in potency relative to the unsubstituted derivative 40. Substitution to the nitrile 41 or the corresponding amide 42 resulted in minimal intrinsic potency change, but diminished cellular potency (note PSA increase).13 Conversion to the 3-pyrazole or 4-pyrazole (16, 22, 43­44) gave a further 3- to 4-fold potency increase and provided compounds with excellent cell potency. Suprisingly, the log P value for 16 was measured to be 0.0 and yet it appears to have sufficient cell permeability. C9Pyrroles 45 and 46 were sub-nanomolar inhibitors in this series with exceptional cell potency. The hydrogen-bond donor ability of these pyrazoles and pyrroles may contribute to potency as the methylated pyrazole 47 was 3-fold less potent. Inhibitors 48­50 were designed to interact with solvent, but their additional basic amine and increased PSA appeared to have a negative impact on cell potency.6 Due to potential stability and metabolic activation issues seen with pyrroles, the C6-pyrazole (as in 16 and 22) was selected as the preferred substitution. Benzoisoquinolinone 16 was brominated selectively at C4 and a library of Suzuki reactions was conducted to

caspase activation assay--a measure of apoptosis.14 HT29 cells were treated sequentially with camptothecin followed by compound 22, then assayed for caspase 3 activity. While camptothecin by itself induces some level of caspase activity, addition of increasing concentrations of compound 22 following camptothecin exposure increased the activity over camptothecin alone (Fig. 2). Compound 22 by itself had no effect on caspase activity. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that release of cells from DNA damage checkpoint arrest results in mitotic catastrophe and cell death. An X-ray crystal structure of the inhibitor-bound complex with Chk1 for compound 54 was obtained and analyzed in order to understand the multiple interactions with the enzyme (Fig. 3).15 Several key hydrogen bonds are made by this molecule that rationalize the increase in potency afforded by the pyrazole, propylamine, and phenol moeties and help to explain the SAR.

complete our SAR assessment in the H1 pocket. While some potency improvements were seen in terms of enzymatic activity, these improvements typically did not translate into elevated cell potency. At the risk of increasing molecular weight, it was found that considerable steric bulk could be accommodated at this position. The bromide 23 was more potent against Chk1 than 16 but less potent in the checkpoint escape cellular assay. Among the numerous groups employed, the phenols 54­56 and the chlorides 59 and 61 did increase enzymatic potency, but the expected increase in cell potency was not realized relative to 16. In the case of the phenols 53­55, PSA is increased, and it is possible that this correlates with some decreased permeability (relative to 16). For the aryl halides 56­62 it is not clear why cell potency decreases relative to 16. Lastly, the potency with the combination of the ortho- and para-Cl substitution was not additive in 62. The larger molecular weight of the compounds in Table 3 (>400) may contribute to the lack of improvement in cellular potency for these C4-substituted inhibitors.

Chk1 inhibitory activity was measured using a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence assay which measures phosphorylation of a biotinylated GSK-3 peptide as described in Barnett, S. et al. Biochem. J. 2005, 385, 399, For the construct, a naturally occurring exon 10 splice variant of the human Chk1 described in patent application US200502666469(A1), containing primarily the kinase domain, was expressed in baculovirus with a Cterminal 6-histidine tag. The protein was purified on a Ni affinity column and used as it is for kinetic assays, or purified further on Heparin and SEC columns for crystallography. The Chk1 concentration was 0.5 nM and ATP was used at 0.1 mM. IC50 values are reported as the averages of at least two independent determinations; standard deviations are within ±25­50% of IC50 values. 11. NCI-H1299 lung carcinoma cells were arrested with 16 h treatment of camptothecin, and then treated with Chk1 inhibitors for additional 8 h. Checkpoint escape due to Chk1 inhibition was assessed by measuring the mitotic specific phosphorylation of nucleolin in Chk1 inhibitor treated cells using an antibody coated, bead-based assay. In this assay, total nucleolin is captured on a streptavidincoated paramagnetic bead coupled with biotinylated nucleolin monoclonal antibody 4E2 (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). Phosphorylated nucleolin is detected by an antibody complex consisting of a phospho-specific nucleolin monoclonal antibody TG3 (Applied NeuroSolutions, Inc.) and a ruthenylated goat anti-mouse IgM antibody labeled with ruthenylation kit (BioVeris Corp). The electrochemiluminescent complex is quantified with BioVeris M-8 Analyzer. The EC50of checkpoint escape mediated by Chk1 inhibition was determined with 10point series diluted Chk1 inhibitor treated tetraplicate cell samples. 12.

pyrazole group makes a hydrogen bond with Ser88 of Chk1. While halogens cannot make this hydrogen bond, Leu20 which lies above the plane of the pyrazole C1 position and the aromatic ring of Tyr86 provides a Van derWaals interaction surface. The propylamine and phenol groups of 54 make numerous hydrogen bonds with protein (both backbone and side chain atoms) and water molecules. Interestingly, the three water molecules which occupy the H1 hydrophobic pocket of Chk1 are not making contacts with the inhibitor (as has been seen in other Chk1: inhibitor structures).6 It is readily apparent that moving the phenol oxygen to the 4-position (55) would allow for hydrogen bonding to one of the three waters in H1 (red spheres in Fig. 3) and to Glu55, a stronger hydrogen bond than that to the backbone. In summary, a novel benzoisoquinolinone core was designed and developed based on HTS lead 1 following a strategy of minimizing the number of basic amines and the PSA values of target compounds. A versatile photochemical synthetic route was developed that allowed for complete control and combination of substitution at C4, C6, and C9. These efforts were guided by X-ray crystallography that correctly predicted the general potency enhancements observed with both the ethyl- and propylamine substitution at C6. Further exploration revealed that the use of nitrogen-heterocycles at C9 provided Chk1 inhibitors with outstanding potency in both enzymatic and cell based assays. The subtle structural effects in this and other series of Chk1 inhibitors on cellular potency and permeability are not fully understood, but a strategy in which PSA and the number of basic amines is minimized in final inhibitor structures expedited the discovery of this potent, cell-permeable class of Chk1 kinase inhibitors.
