ABSTRACT The calcium-binding protein isolated from the sarcoplasm of the muscles of the sand worm Nereis diversicolor has four EF-hands and three active binding sites for Ca21 or Mg21. Nereis diversicolor sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein contains three tryptophan residues at positions 4, 57, and 170, respectively. The Wt protein shows a very limited fluorescence increase upon binding of Ca21 or Mg21. Single-tryptophan-containing mutants were produced and purified. The fluorescence titrations of these mutants show a limited decrease of the affinity for calcium, but no alterations of the cooperativity. Upon adding calcium, Trp170 shows a strong fluorescence increase, Trp57 an extensive fluorescence decrease, and Trp4 shows no fluorescence change. Therefore mutant W4F/W170F is ideally suited to analyze the fluorescence titrations and to study the binding mechanism. Mutations of the calcium ligands at the z-position in the three binding sites show no effect at site I and a total loss of cooperativity at sites III and IV. The quenching of Trp57 upon calcium binding is dependent on the presence of arginine R25, but this residue is not just a simple dynamic quencher. The role of the salt bridge R25-D58 is also investigated.

INTRODUCTION Conformational changes play an essential role in the function of proteins. A very sensitive way to study these conformational changes is monitoring the change in tryptophan fluorescence properties. Tryptophan is a naturally occurring fluorescent probe present in most proteins and is sensitive to its immediate environment. Therefore it can be used to study interesting regions in the protein that play an essential role in the conformational change of the protein as a whole. Conformational changes are usually induced by ligand binding and calcium binding is a particularly interesting case. In this work we studied the calcium binding protein isolated from the sarcoplasm of the muscles of the sand worm Nereis diversicolor (NSCP), which has 174 amino acids (Collins et al., 1988) and a relative molecular mass of 19,485. The ° three-dimensional x-ray structure (at 2 A resolution) of 21 Ca -bound NSCP (Fig. 1) is described by Vijay-Kumar and Cook (1992) and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure is described by Craescu et al. (1998). NSCP has four domains with the typical EF-hand (Kretsinger and Nockolds, 1973) Ca21-binding sequence, but only sites I, III, and IV can bind Ca21 or Mg21. The protein has a compact structure with a central hydrophobic core of 20 amino acids, most of which are aromatic. The domains I and II form a pair by a back-to-back b-sheet just like the pair of III and IV. NSCP is mainly a-helical (58%) with eight helices (A­H). Initial Ca21-binding studies were analyzed in terms of three

identical intrinsic binding constants of 1.7 3 108 Mÿ1 at pH 7.5 and 258C, whereas Mg21 binding was found to be cooperative with intrinsic binding constants of 0.83, 2.6, and 15 3 104 Mÿ1, respectively (Cox and Stein, 1981). Further conformational and microcalorimetry studies on the protein (Luan-Rilliet et al., 1992) and on isolated tryptic fragments lead to the proposal of a new sequential binding model starting at site I (Durussel et al., 1993). In this study we use site-directed mutagenesis instead of protein fragments to analyze the binding mechanism. NSCP contains three tryptophan residues at positions 4, 57, and 170, respectively. These tryptophans are located at interesting positions in the protein. Trp4 is positioned at the beginning of helix A and is not involved in an EF-hand, but is close to helix D which makes the connection between domains II and III together with helix E. Trp57 is positioned at the second (inactive) domain with the indole group close to the binding site of the first domain. This makes W57 ideally located for observing the changes at the interdomain region between domains I and II upon binding of Ca21 or Mg21. Trp170 is positioned at the end of the last helix H, but the indole group is located in the hydrophobic core in the center of the protein. Therefore W170 is ideally located for observing the general conformational change in the protein. Altogether, NSCP is an interesting model protein to study the conformational change upon ion binding--also because it has a high sequence similarity with other sarcoplasmic Ca21binding proteins (Nakayama and Kretsinger, 1994), e.g., the sarcoplasmic calcium-binding proteins from shrimp, crayfish, and streptomyces. In proteins, tryptophan fluorescence displays a multiexponential decay originating from the different possible microconformations of tryptophan (Dahms et al., 1995; Sillen et al., 2000). Other models are also suggested to explain the existence of a multiexponential decay

The Conformational Change of NSCP

1883 The tryptophan mutations and R25D and D58R are described in Sillen et al. (2000). Mutants were identified by restriction analysis and the mutated genes were entirely sequenced using the ABI PrismTM Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction system (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA).

Expression and purification
The Escherichia coli strain Bli5 (Bl21(DE3) 1 pDIA17) (Chang and Cohen, 1978; Studier and Moffat, 1986; Raleigh et al., 1988; Munier et al., 1991) was transformed by electroporation with the pETNSCP plasmids. Cells were then treated as described by Dekeyzer et al. (1994). The difference in negative charges between the Ca21 and the apo states of the protein was used to purify NSCP. In a first step, NSCP, in the presence of Ca21, was isolated from the other cell proteins by anion exchange chromatography (DEAE, Fast-Flow, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). This was repeated, but with adjusting to 5 mM EGTA (apo conformation). In a last step, NSCP was purified on a Hiload Superdex 75 prepgrade 16/60 column (Pharmacia). All NSCP variants were $99% pure as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS gels. All the variants where stored with 2 mM CaCl2. The apo form was made by adding EGTA and EDTA to a 10-mM concentration each. The Mg21 form was made by adjusting the apo form solution to 20 mM MgCl2.

(Alcala et al., 1987; Van Gilst et al., 1994; Lakowicz, 2000). NSCP is also an interesting protein to gain more insight into protein fluorescence. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials
Isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). MgCl2 and EDTA were purchased from Janssen Chimica (Beerse, Belgium). CaCl2 was obtained from Riedel de Haen (Seelze, Germany), GuHCl from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), and n-acetyltryptophanamide and EGTA were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). The buffer solution was 50 mM TrisÁHCl at pH 7.5. The ionic strength of the solutions was always 0.2-M adjusted with KCl. All buffer reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma, Janssen Chimica, ICN (Aurora, Ohio), or Fluka. All solutions were filtered through a 0.22-mm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and were spectroscopically pure. All the restriction endonucleases and Klenow polymerase were obtained from either New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). The DNA purification kits were from Diagen (Dusseldorf, Germany). ¨

Steady-state fluorescence
Steady-state fluorescence was measured with a SPEX spectrofluorometer (Fluorolog 1691, Spex Industries, Edison, NJ) with excitation and emission slits providing a bandpass of 7.2 and 3.6 nm, respectively. Spectra are corrected for the wavelength dependence of the emission monochromator and the photomultiplier and also by subtracting background intensities of the buffer solution. The cuvette holder was thermostated at 228C. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm to ensure that the measured signal is only due to tryptophan fluorescence.

Ultraviolet absorption
Ultraviolet absorption was measured on a UVIKON Kontron 940 spectrophotometer (Kontron AG, Eching, Germany). The molar absorption coefficients at 295 nm are calculated by taking the ratio of the absorbance at 295 nm and at 280 nm, multiplied by the molar absorption coefficients at 280 nm, which was calculated according to the method of Mach et al. (1992).

Fluorescence lifetime data
Fluorescence lifetime data were determined as described previously (Sillen et al., 2000) using an automated multifrequency phase fluorometer. The instrument is similar to that described by Lakowicz et al. (1985), except for the use of a high-gain photomultiplier (Model H5023, Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) instead of a microchannel plate. The detection part is described by Vos et al. (1997). The excitation source consists of a mode-locked titanium-doped sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, CA) pumped by a Beamlok 2080 Ar1-ion laser (Model 2080, Spectra-Physics). After frequency-tripling (GWU, Spectra-Physics) the excitation wavelength is 295 nm. The fluorescence lifetime measurements are performed by measuring the phase-shift of the modulated emission at 50 frequencies ranging from 1.6 MHz to ;1 GHz. N-Acetyltryptophanamide (in water filtered by the Milli-Q system, Millipore) with a fluorescence lifetime of 3.059 ns or p-terphenyl in cyclohexane with a lifetime of 1.04 ns (Desie et al., 1986) both at 228C was used as a reference fluorophore. The measured phase shifts, f, at a modulation frequency, v, of the exciting light are related to the fluorescence decay in the time domain I(t),

Mutagenesis
The NSCP gene was transferred from the plasmid pNDner06 (Dekeyzer et al., 1994) into the plasmid pET22b(1) (Studier et al., 1990) resulting in pETNSCP (van Riel, 1997). In this plasmid the NSCP gene is under control of the strong T7 promoter. For expression of NSCP mutants, the plasmid pETNSCP was used, into which the NSCP mutant genes were constructed either by polymerase chain reaction or by cassette mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to Sambrook et al. (1989). The following oligonucleotides were used:

D27N: 59-TAGATTCGAAGTTCATACGAGTGATAGCAC-39 BstBI E115Q: 59-GAGACCAATACGGTATCTTCTTC-39 E149Q: 59-GTCTCTCGAGCAATTCGTTATCGCAG-39 XhoI

Sillen et al. quenching is heterogeneous. If there is static quenching and an increase of the fluorescence due to population reshuffling, then fPR is the minimum increasing factor of fluorescence intensity due to a change in the balance between microconformations.

Time-resolved anisotropy
Measuring the frequency-dependent phase difference between the parallel and perpendicular components of the modulated fluorescence revealed the rotational correlation times fi with their relative amplitudes (+gi ¼ 1), together with the initial anisotropy r0 (anisotropy in the absence of depolarizing processes) by fitting the frequency transform of a multiexponential anisotropy decay law (Weber, 1977),

EGTA titration
NSCP Wt and variants are excited at 295 nm, and the emission is measured at maximum emission wavelength (Ca21 state). We use a quartz cuvette with stirrer (1-cm optical pathway, Hellma Benelux, Aartselaar, Belgium) that contains 1.2 ml of the protein solution. The protein concentration is 13 mM. This solution contains ;0.2 mM CaCl2. The correct concentration of Ca21 in the solution is determined by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Model 372, PerkinElmer). First, the fluorescence is measured 603 during 1 min. Then a certain volume (2­10 ml) of a 250 or 500 mM EGTA solution is added, depending on the current free calcium concentration. After addition of EGTA, the solution is equilibrated for 3 min before the next measurement. To calculate the concentration of Ca21 present in the solution, we use the software program Chelator (Schoenmakers, 1992) that takes the concentration of EGTA, buffer, temperature, and ionic strength into account. During the titration the ionic strength increases, due to the addition of Na2-H2ÁEGTA, from the original value of 0.1 M to 0.106 M. Between Ca21 concentrations it decreases from 0.2 mM to 10ÿ8M and the ionic strength increases to 0.16 M when Ca21 is further decreased to 10ÿ9 M. Calcium Green-1 indicator (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) is a fluorescent indicator used to check the titration procedure and the calculations made by Chelator. Calcium Green-1 indicator has a single binding site for Ca21. The indicator is excited at 488 nm and the fluorescence is measured at 533 nm. Upon binding of Ca21 the fluorescence increases. The indicator is titrated the same way as the protein samples and the correct binding constant of 5.2 3 106 Mÿ1 was obtained.

where gi are the amplitudes and fi the rotational correlation times. The analysis was performed assuming that each fluorescing species with lifetime ti has the same anisotropy function (Lakowicz et al., 1985). No indication for associative decay was found. The rotation angle of tryptophan was calculated according to Lipari and Szabo (1980) for free diffusion within a cone angle u.

Data analysis was performed using a nonlinear least-squares algorithm (Bevington, 1969). Several statistical techniques were used in the fitting procedure, as described by Clays et al. (1989). Measurements performed at different emission wavelengths were analyzed simultaneously with global analysis (GLOBALS Unlimited, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL) to increase the resolution of the lifetimes and the corresponding amplitudes (Beechem et al., 1983). Phase data were fitted using the modified LevenbergMarquardt algorithm (More and Sorensen, 1983) assuming fluorescence lifetimes that are independent of the emission wavelength and a variable amplitude ratio. The lifetimes did not change across the different wavelengths. Quantum yields were determined relative to tryptophan in water according to the method of Parker and Rees (1960), where the intensity is integrated over the wavelength region 300­450 nm, with the absorbance at 295 nm, and the quantum yield QTrp for tryptophan in water is taken as 0.14 (Kirby and Steiner, 1970).

Quin 2 titration
Quin 2 titrations are done according to Linse et al. (1991). Quin 2 separately and Quin 2 (25 mM), together with NSCP (10 mM), are titrated with Ca21 by monitoring the absorption of Quin 2 at 263 nm. First, the exact concentration of Quin 2 is determined by titration with Ca21 and the dissociation constant is 60 nM (Tsien and Pozzan, 1989) at the ionic strength of 0.10 M. During the titration the ionic strength increases to 0.11 M due to the addition of Ca21. The absorption in the absence of Ca21 (ODmax) is determined by measuring Quin 2 with 10 mM EGTA. Then Quin 2, together with NSCP, are titrated with Ca21. The exact concentration of NSCP is determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm. The absorption of the Ca21 free system (ODmax) is determined by measuring Quin 2, NSCP, and 10 mM EGTA. The amount of bound Ca21 is calculated from the ODmax and the absorption at excess Ca21. From this it is possible to calculate the fractional saturation of NSCP with Ca21.

Decay-associated spectra
Decay-associated spectra are constructed by multiplying the intensity fraction with the intensity of the emission spectra at the respective wavelength (Ross et al., 1981). A log-normal function (Burstein and Emelyanenko, 1996) is fitted to the associated intensities to obtain the decayassociated spectra. The average radiative rate constant is calculated by dividing the quantum yield by a wavelength-independent amplitude average lifetime (Willis and Szabo, 1992; Sillen and Engelborghs, 1998). Each lifetime is integrated over the wavelength region 300­450 nm and then normalized (Sillen et al., 2000).

Fitting
Curve fitting of the fluorescence titration curves is done with a nonlinear least-squares fitting program (SigmaPlot-5, SPSS, Chicago, IL). Attempts were made to fit the whole titration curve to the full Adair equation

Calculation of the change in fluorescence intensity due to static and dynamic quenching and by a change in the population of microconformations
We suggested splitting the ratio of the quantum yield of different variants relative to a reference protein, e.g., Wt, into a factor ( fkr) representing the change in kr, or homogenous static quenching, a factor ( fPR) reflecting heterogeneous static quenching or population reshuffling, and a factor ( fDQ) representing pure dynamic quenching (Sillen and Engelborghs, 1998; Sillen et al., 1999). The factor fPR is affected by static quenching only if the static Biophysical Journal 85(3) 1882­1893

where seven fitting parameters are necessary (i.e., uI is the Adair coefficient, and Fi is the relative fluorescence of the species NSCP). Cai was not acceptable, because the parameters obtained displayed a strong dependency

with n the Hill coefficient (here assumed to be constant during the titration) and K the average association constant for the three sites. This equation, however, cannot be used to fit the titration curve of the Wt because in Wt the fluorescence change is biphasic, i.e., a fluorescence decrease is followed by an increase. The biphasic curve could be fitted with the following equation:

We also used Quin titrations in this case and analyzed them with the Hill equation. Our results and numerical simulations show that the Hill coefficient obtained from direct binding studies can be substantially lower (1.83) than those obtained from protein fluorescence titrations, due to the nonlinear relation between protein fluorescence and calcium binding.

that were measured in Ca21-bound, Mg21-bound, and apo states, reveals that the quantum yield of Wt decreases only slightly in the following order of Ca21 [ Mg21 [ apo. The quantum yield of Wt is 0.14, a typical value for free tryptophan. The two tryptophan residues that show a large fluorescence change upon Ca21 removal are W57 and W170. This large change is not observed in Wt because the changes in the two tryptophans have opposite signs; the quantum yield of W170 increases from 0.09 to 0.14, whereas the quantum yield of W57 decreases from 0.14 to 0.03 upon the binding of Ca21. The fluorescence of W4 increases only slightly upon binding of Ca21. The quantum yield of W4 varies between 0.21 and 0.24 for all states, which is a rather high value. The fluorescence of W57 is also strongly influenced by the salt bridge R25-D58 in the environment of W57. It is interesting to note that the molar absorption coefficients of individual tryptophans at 295 nm can vary between 2338 and 3194, whereas the molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm is much more constrained (Mach et al., 1992). Time-resolved fluorescence parameters The measurements were performed at emission wavelengths ranging from 320 to 380 nm in 10-nm intervals. A typical measurement is shown in Fig. 2. A single- or doubleexponential fit to the phase data yielded unacceptably high values of x R2 and a significant nonrandomness in the autocorrelation function of the weighted residuals as

a function of the frequency. Best fit with lowest xR2 and no systematic deviations in the autocorrelation function of the weighted residuals is obtained with a triple- or quadrupleexponential function. To improve the recovery of the decay parameters, a global analysis of all the phase measurements at the different wavelengths was performed. The results of this global fit are summarized in Table 2. The decayassociated spectra are shown in Figs. 3 and 4.

Lb absorption bands (Callis, 1997; Ruggiero et al., 1990). This is also the case for most of the NSCP variants. Fluorescence and EGTA titration of NSCP Although the fluorescence titration curves of the singletryptophan-containing mutants show big changes in fluorescence intensities, we could not fit them to the full Adair equation (Eq. 4) because the fitting program (SigmaPlot) signals that the parameters are strongly interdependent, indicating that one is forced to use a simpler equation. We therefore switched to the Hill equation (Eq. 5) with essentially only two parameters (K and n), since F0 and F3 are the extremes of the titration curves. However, titration of Ca21 Wt with EGTA gives rise to a biphasic fluorescence change (Fig. 5). Starting from the high Ca21 concentrations, first a decrease in fluorescence, and subsequently an increase, is observed. Such a biphasic curve cannot be fitted with a simple Hill equation. We performed Quin titrations as an alternative method to monitor the binding of Ca21 to NSCP Wt by measuring the absorption change of Quin 2 in the presence of NSCP Wt with Ca21. From this the association constants was determined to be (9.8 6 0.4) 3 107 (Mÿ1) and the Hill coefficients was 1.6 6 0.2. It should be noted that this Hill coefficient is an underestimation of the one determined by protein fluorescence changes by as much as a factor of 1.8

Anisotropy decay parameters Time-resolved anisotropy measurements are obtained from the frequency-dependent phase angle difference between the parallel and perpendicular components of the modulated fluorescence emission. Best fit with x R2 near unity and no systematic deviations in the weighted residuals is obtained with a double-exponential fit resulting in two rotational correlation times. The results of the fit are summarized in Table 3. The long rotational correlation time can be associated with the overall rotation of NSCP, whereas the short rotation correlation time can be associated with the local motion of the tryptophan (Lakowicz, 1999). The apparent time zero anisotropy r0 for tryptophan and tryptophan derivatives is ;0.19 at 295 nm (Valeur and Weber, 1977; Lakowicz et al., 1983), usually interpreted as due to the presence of 1La and

The fluorescence titration of Wt protein could also be fitted with a simplified Adair equation (Eq. 6) and the following parameters were obtained: F0 ¼ 2.13 6 0.02, F1 ¼ 1.91 6 0.03, F3 ¼ 2.27 6 0.01 (all 3 105 in arbitrary units), u1 ¼ (1.3 6 0.5) 3 109 Mÿ1, and hu3i1/3 ¼ (2.9 6 0.2) 3 108 Mÿ1. However, we do not trust the first binding constant, because at calcium concentrations \10ÿ9 M the ionic strength of the solution increases too much. Fitting the titrations of W57 and W170 (Fig. 6 and Table 4) and comparing with Wt reveals that mutating two tryptophans into Phe changes the association constant of Ca21 to NSCP to somewhat lower values. The association constants and Hill coefficients are summarized in Table 4. But the mutations have no effect on the cooperativity of the binding because the Hill coefficient of Wt and W4F/W57F are approximately the same, and is only slightly lower for the W4F/W170F variant (n ¼ 2.6) (Table 4), taking into account the effect of the factor 1.8 between the Hill coefficient obtained from fluorescence titrations and from direct binding studies. Mutating calcium ligands in the ion-binding loop of domain I has only little effect on the association constants and Hill coefficients

(Table 4). Mutations in domains III and IV, however, lower the association constants and reduce the Hill coefficients to 1. To check whether the mutations of tryptophan have an influence on the fluorescence of the remaining tryptophan residues, we calculated the fluorescence intensity of the different tryptophans and compared the addition of the intensities with the fluorescence intensity of Wt (Table 5). In all ion-binding states of NSCP, the sum of the fluorescence intensity approximates the intensity of Wt very closely.

DISCUSSION EGTA and Quin 2 titration of NSCP To determine the binding mechanism of Ca21 to NSCP, Ca21-bound NSCP and mutants were titrated with EGTA or, as alternative method, Quin 2 and NSCP with Ca21. The association constant and Hill coefficients were determined (Table 4 and Figs. 5 and 6). Comparing Wt with W4F/W170F and W4F/W57F shows that replacing the tryptophans lowers the affinity for calcium ions but has no effect on the cooperativity of binding.

monitoring the fluorescence change are 1.83 bigger than the value determined by Quin 2 titration due to the nonlinearity of the fluorescence change with the Ca21 binding which can be confirmed by simple simulations (Engelborghs et al., 1990). Changing the calcium binding residue (z-position) in domain I has only a small influence on Ca21 binding, although changing the residues (z-positions) in domains III and IV, on the other hand, has a large influence on the Ca21 binding, in that the average affinity is not much influenced but the cooperativity is totally lost. Mutation of the z-position in site I (D20N) has very little effect on the calcium-binding properties (data not shown). Mutation at the z-position (D108N) in site III has a similar effect as the mutation at z in site III: loss of cooperativity, but little effect on the overall binding constant (data not shown). A sequential binding mechanism was observed for recoverin (Permyakov et al., 2000) and calmodulin (Haiech and Kilhoffer, 2000). But in the case of recoverin the binding was totally lost by a mutation in the first binding site. Here it is clear that binding at sites III or IV both cause a cooperative transition, and that the ligands at z-position are crucial probably by pulling the a-helices together to form the EF-hand.

Fluorescence properties of individual tryptophan residues
W4

Trp4 is positioned at the beginning of the helix A and is not involved in a EF-hand, but is close to helix D which, together with helix E, makes the connection between domains II and III. Quantum yield, average lifetime, decay-associated spectra, lifetimes, anisotropy data. and quenching analysis reveal that there is only a minor change in the environment of W4 upon addition of Ca21 or Mg21 (Table 6). The high quantum yield is the result of the high population (80%) of the long lifetime (5.2 ns). This mutant protein was not further studied.
W170

Trp170 is positioned at the end of helix H, but the indole group is located in the hydrophobic core in the center of the protein. This makes W170 ideally located for observing the general conformational change in the protein. Indeed, upon changing from the Ca21 state to the Mg21 state there is a decrease of the quantum yield of 10%, and from the Ca21

to the apo state there is a decrease of 32% (Table 6). This effect originates in a decrease in the measured radiative rate constant and additionally for the apo state in a higher population of the short and middle lifetime at the expense of the longest lifetime (population reshuffling). The x-ray structure reveals that W170 is totally buried. It has a wavelength of maximum intensity (lmax) of 338 nm in the Ca21 state. This is considered to be typical for tryptophan residues in an environment that is highly hydrophobic but also with water molecules with low mobility bound to the protein matrix (Burstein, 1983; Eftink, 1990). In the apo state, lmax shifts to 350 nm, which is characteristic for solvent-accessible tryptophans. This indicates that, although W170 is in the core of NSCP in the Ca21 state, upon changing to the apo state the core opens and water can penetrate resulting in a partially denatured structure. This is confirmed by FTIR measurements: the percentage of a-helix drops in the apo state by 14% compared to the Ca21 state, whereas the unordered structure rises from 26% to 38% (van Riel, 1997)

and this is also confirmed by NMR and circular dichroism measurements (Christova et al., 2000; Precheur et al., 1996; ^ Cox and Stein, 1981). Also the rotational correlation time associated with the rotation of the whole protein and the rotation angle u of W170 and W57 increases in the apo state (Table 3). The hydrophobic core of NSCP consists of mainly Phe and Tyr residues. Three of these hydrophobic core residues (F28, Y116, and F150) are in direct contact with the EF-hand structure and they are always the immediate neighbor of the amino acid responsible for the complexation of the ions at z-position in all three sites. These amino acids are conserved in most sarcoplasmic calcium-binding proteins (Collins et al., 1988). Consequently, removal of Ca21 or Mg21 destabilizes the hydrophobic core of NSCP.
W57

Trp57 is positioned at the second inactive domain with the indole group close to the binding site of the first domain.

This makes W57 ideally located for observing the changes at the interdomain region of domains I and II upon binding of Ca21 or Mg21. Upon binding of Ca21 or Mg21, there is a fluorescence intensity decrease with a factor of 0.76 and 0.77, respectively. This decrease is largely caused by the higher population of the two lowest lifetimes--together, 89%--and is only to a limited extent due to direct dynamic quenching (Table 6). The different lifetimes of W57 have been explained on the basis of microstates of tryptophan (Sillen et al., 2000). The rotational correlation time of the whole protein and the rotation angle u of W57 increases in the apo form, whereas the rotational correlation time of W57 itself decreases, indicating a more flexible environment of W57 in the apo form. The lmax of W57 in the Ca21 state is very blue-shifted (317 nm), a phenomenon that could be due to the electromagnetic field over the tryptophan (Vivian and Callis, 2001).

Role of arginine R25 Although arginine is not found to be among the solution quenchers (Chen and Barkley, 1998), it is often observed as being a dynamic quencher of protein fluorescence (Clark et al., 1996; Christiaens et al., 2002) when arginine is very close to the aromatic ring of Trp. Studying the x-ray structure of NSCP, however, shows that the guanidinium moiety of R25 is not in contact with the aromatic rings of W57. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the quenching parameters (Table 6) indicates that the fluorescence change upon mutation R25D is largely due to population reshuffling ( fPR).

Influence of the salt bridge R25-D58 on the fluorescence properties of W57 Trp57 is located near the salt bridge R25-D58. This salt bridge connects the binding site of domain I with domain II. R25 is located adjacent to the amino acid responsible for the x-binding coordinate of the metal, and D58 is located in helix C. A similar situation exists in the two other domains of III and IV, where R113 is located just next to the amino acid responsible for the x-binding coordinate of the metal and forms a salt bridge with D135 located in helix G, and is in

close contact with binding site IV (9A from the Ca21). To investigate the influence of the salt bridge R25-D58 on the fluorescence of W57 and to investigate its function in the conformational change upon binding of the ions, two additional mutations were made--i.e., R25D, which breaks the salt bridge; and R25D/D58R, which potentially switches the orientation of the salt bridge. W4F/W170F/R25D Upon breaking of the salt bridge, the two lower lifetimes of the Ca21 state converge to their arithmetic mean while the two longer lifetimes remain identical. The fluorescence lifetimes of the Ca21, Mg21, or apo forms are the same; only the amplitude fractions depend upon the binding of an ion. The apo state has a higher fluorescence intensity due to a higher population of the two longer lifetimes. The lmax shifts ;10 nm to the red in changing from the Ca21 state to the apo state in both W4F/W170F and W4F/W170F/R25D. This indicates that W57 is more solvent-accessible in the apo state. There is a strong red-shift in all forms upon removing the salt bridge, indicating the existence of the salt bridge even in the apo form. Additionally, there is still a red-shift upon removing the Ca21 ions from the binding site. The calcium binding site on its own is not able to create the fully shielded state of the W57. The intact salt bridge is partially responsible for this. W4F/W170F/R25D/D58R This mutation can potentially restore the salt bridge (but with opposite orientation, although we have no experimental evidence that it actually does so). This mutation has the effect that Ca21 binding changes the amplitude fractions but keeps the lifetimes similar to those of the Wt apo state. Thus the lifetimes of W57 are Wt-apo-like in this mutant and the binding site is only affecting the population of the different micro conformations. The lmax shifts only 3 nm to the red upon removal of Ca21, indicating a more similar solvent accessibility in the vicinity of W57 in comparison with W4F/ W170F. Also in this variant all the lifetimes of the apo state are longer. Arginine is thus necessary for the longer fluorescence lifetimes and this elongation of the lifetimes is stronger in the apo state (Table 6). In the variant W4F/ W170F, R25 interacts differently in the metal-bound state than in the metal-free state, resulting in a different conformation around W57 between the two states. CONCLUSION The x-ray structure determination reveals that the Ca21 binding loop I is anchored to the rest of the protein by residues I15, R25, and F28. This Ca21 binding loop is also connected by hydrogen bonds between the b-sheet of loop I to the b-sheet of the inactive loop II. The wavelength of

maximum emission of W57 shifts from 317 nm to 330 nm in going from the Ca21 state to the apo state, indicating a more solvent-accessible conformation. Also the anisotropy measurements reveal that W57 becomes more flexible in the apo state. Thus, one or more of the anchors has loosened or disappeared in the apo state. Upon removal of the salt bridge R25-D58, the wavelength of maximum emission of the holoform shifts from 317 nm to 336 nm and also the anisotropy data indicate a more flexible W57. In the apo state the wavelength of maximum emission shifts even further to 345 nm, indicating that W57 becomes very solventaccessible. This proves that the salt bridge is still important even in the apo state of the W4F/W170F variant. Other interactions are therefore responsible for the formation of the holostate, e.g., the two amino acids I15 and F28, or other hydrogen bonds. These two amino acids are anchored in the hydrophobic core of NSCP. The wavelength of maximum emission of W170 shifts from 338 nm in the Ca21 state to 350 nm in the apo state. This wavelength of maximum emission is the same as that of free tryptophan in solution. This indicates a large change in the hydrophobic core of NSCP. This supports the conclusion about the I15 and F28 anchors. EGTA titration of the Wt and mutants and the Quin 2 titration of Wt reveals that cooperative binding occurs at domains III and IV probably due to the formation of the b-sheet that connects the two domains and that domain I behaves more as an independent site. The Hill coefficient, which is a measure for cooperativity, is ;2, indicating that there is cooperativity (although there is no real full cooperativity; n ¼ 3). Both W57 and W170 are sensitive to the full conformational change due to ion binding (Fig. 5). The behavior of the individual tryptophan residues (W57 and W170) is in agreement with the studies on tryptic fragments of NSCP done by Durussel et al. (1993). The N-terminal peptide (1­80) showed a single binding site with a Ka ¼ 3.1 3 105 Mÿ1 and a fluorescence decrease upon calcium binding; the C-terminal peptide (90­174) showed two binding sites with Ka ¼ 3.2 3 104 Mÿ1 and a fluorescence increase upon calcium binding. Combining this information with the biphasic behavior of the Wt protein it is tempting to assume a sequential-binding mechanism with initial binding at site I and then with strong cooperativity at sites III and IV. This sequence also explains that lowering the affinity at sites III and IV shows up as a decreased cooperativity, although the same mutation at site I does not influence the overall transition. This cooperativity questions the possibility to limit the saturation of NSCP to one and the same site at stoichiometric amounts of calcium and protein as was done in an NMR study of NSCP (Precheur et al., 1996). The biological relevance of this ^ binding mechanism is not clear as long as the exact biological role of these proteins is not known or limited to the concept of a calcium buffer. The lifetime data on the R25D and R25D/D58R variants indicate that the salt bridge is present also in the apo

conformation of W57 and that orientation of the salt bridge is important to create the Ca21-like environment of W57. Recently it has been shown that the local electric field around the tryptophan residue can have a pronounced influence on the energy level of the low Trp ring-to-backbone charge transfer (Callis and Vivian, 2003) and the effect of Arg on the fluorescence might also be explainable by this effect. Quantum mechanical calculations are, however, necessary to confirm this.
