Abstract Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII or prostate-specific membrane antigen or NAALADase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the neuropeptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) to N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate (G). Inhibitors of GCPII provide neuroprotection in a variety of animal models of central nervous system disorders. Neuroprotection is probably the result of increased NAAG concentrations and decreased levels of excess toxic glutamate. Consequently, GCPII inhibitors could be useful therapeutic agents where increased glutamate levels are the result of increased GCPII activity. Current GCPII in vitro activity assays are cumbersome or have limited sensitivity. In this report we describe a microplate assay to study GCPII inhibition that is most sensitive, efficient, and generates little waste. GCPII turnover number (kcat Þ was 4 sÀ1 and the binding constant (Km Þ for NAAG and GCPII was 130 nM. The apparent association rate constant for GCPII and NAAG (kcat =Km Þ was 3 Â 107 MÀ1 sÀ1 . Inhibition studies with the GCPII inhibitor 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA) demonstrated competitive inhibition with a Ki ¼ 0:2 nM. Ó 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII)1 is a metallopeptidase that hydrolyzes the neuropeptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) to glutamate (G) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) [1]. GCPII was initially referred as N-acetylated-a-linked-acidic dipeptidase, NAALA dipeptidase, or NAALADase [1,2]. Later on it was shown that prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a prostate cancer marker that had been reported earlier [3,4], exhibited the same substrate and pharmacological characteristics as the brain dipeptidase [5]. Further, PSMA cDNA is 86% identical to NAALADase rat brain cDNA, demonstrating that the two enzymes are closely related molecular species [5]. The official name given to the enzyme is glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII, EC 3.4.17.21).

NAAG is thought to be a storage form of synaptic glutamate. It activates mGluR3 and acts as a partial NMDA receptor agonist, interactions associated with neuroprotection [6]. On the other hand, excessive glutamate levels are widely associated with neuronal injury in many central nervous disorders [7]. Selective NAALADase inhibition is neuroprotective in both in vivo and in vitro models of ischemic brain injury [8]. The mechanism of brain neuroprotection could be through GCPII inhibition that in turn brings decreased glutamate and increased NAAG levels. GCPII inhibitors could be beneficial in the treatment of diseases where excess glutamate levels are the result of increased GCPII activity. Currently, GCPII is a pharmacological target being pursued in the clinic for the regulation of glutamate and it is the focus of study of several academic and industrial laboratories. Traditionally GCPII activity in vitro is monitored through the hydrolysis [3 H]NAAG to NAA and [3 H]Glu. Even though this assay is most sensitive for following glutamate production, it is cumbersome and time consuming [1,9]. We report the development of a microplate GCPII radioactivity-based assay that is

sensitive, efficient, and generates little waste. The new protocol was used to determine the steady-state parameters for the GCPII-catalyzed hydrolysis of NAAG and to study the inhibition of the enzyme by 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA).

Results Assay protocol The radioactivity-based assay [1,9] was miniaturized to a 96-well format; the reaction volume was reduced 20fold from 1.0 ml to 50 ll. Small volumes were added with an automatic ``multidrop'' pipettor for quick and accurate volume dispensation and the hand-assembled Pasteur pipette columns were replaced by a 96-well minicolumn assembly that eliminated radioactive glass waste. The solid scintillator coated 96-well plates eliminated liquid scintillation and related radioactive waste. The counting time was also reduced because the top count used 6 probes simultaneously in contrast to the more traditional single probe scintillation counter. Steady-state kinetics of GCPII NAAG hydrolysis was dependent on GCPII concentration up to 160 pM (Fig. 1A) and on time of incubation up to 50 min (Fig. 1B). The reaction obeyed Michaelis­Menten kinetics (Fig. 1C). The binding constant (Km Þ for NAAG was 130 (Æ40) nM, a value that is in the range of what is reported in the literature: 87­540 nM [1,13]. GCPII turnover (kcat Þ was 4 (Æ2) sÀ1 . The apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction of free GCPII with free NAAG, kcat =Km , was 3 Â 107 ðÆ1 Â 107 Þ MÀ1 sÀ1 . Values in parentheses are the standard deviations for 5 independent determinations. Inhibition of GCPII by 2-PMPA GCPII inhibition by 2-PMPA exhibited competitive inhibition (Fig. 2A); as the concentration of inhibitor was increased from 0 to 10 nM, the apparent Michaelis constant (Km app Þ increased. Even though the rates of hydrolysis at 4 lM NAAG at different 2-PMPA concentrations was lower than Vmax in the absence of inhibitor, the trends of the curves suggested that at larger NAAG concentrations the rates would be the same. Further, the reciprocal plot of the data (Fig. 2B) showed the same intercept on the y-axis (1/Vmax Þ, thus confirming the same Vmax value under different 2-PMPA concentrations. The secondary plot of the slopes for each line on the reciprocal plot (Km app =Vmax Þ vs inhibitor concentration gave a straight line with an intercept on the x-axis equal to ÀKi . The value of Ki determined from this secondary plot was 0.2 nM (Fig. 2C).

Materials and methods Reagents NAAG and NAA [3 H]G were obtained from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland) and Perkin­Elmer (Boston, MA), respectively. Human recombinant GCPII was kindly provided by Dr. Jan Konvalinka from the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. The details of the cloning and purification have been published [10]. 2-(Phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid was synthesized by the Medicinal Chemistry Department at Guilford Pharmaceuticals [11]. The 96-well spin column was obtained from Harvard Bioscience (Holliston, MA). Enzyme activity assay The radioactivity-based assay [1,9] served as a point of departure for the new protocol. The reaction mixture contained NAA[3 H]G (30 nM, 4.3 nmol/lCi) and GCPII (20 or 40 pM), in Tris­HCl (pH 7.4, 40 mM) containing CoCl2 (1 mM), in a total volume of 50 ll. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped with icecold sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 0.1 M, and 50 ll). Blanks were obtained by incubating the reaction mixture in the presence of 2-PMPA (10 lM), a selective and potent inhibitor of GCPII [11]. An aliquot of the reaction mixture (90 ll) was transferred to a 96-well spin column containing AG1X8 ion-exchange resin; the plate was centrifuged at 900 rpm for 3­5 min using a Beckman GS6R centrifuge equipped with a PTS-2000 rotor. NAA[3 H]G bound to the resin and [3 H]G eluted in the flowthrough. The columns were then washed twice with formate (1 M, 90 ll) to ensure complete elution of [3 H]G. The flowthrough and the washes were collected in a deep 96-well block; an aliquot, 200 ll out of a total volume of 270 ll, was transferred to a solid scintillator-coated 96well plate (Packard) and dried to completion. The radioactivity corresponding to [3 H]G was determined with a scintillation counter (Topcount NXT, Packard, counting efficiency 40%). Assay points for each experiment were mostly the average of eight determinations. Data analysis Km ; Vmax ; Km =Vmax and the error determinations of these ratios were obtained by using Leonora [12], a computer program that carries out a least-squares fit to the Michaelis­Menten equation: v ¼ Vmax ½S=ðKm þ ½SÞ.

Discussion The radioactivity-based microplate assay we report here includes several improvements of the standard radioactivity-based assay making it much more expedi-

Unless otherwise specified, NAA [3 H]G (30 pM, 4.3 nmol/lCi) was incubated with GCPII (40 pM) in Tris­HCl buffer (pH 7.4, 40 mM) containing CoCl2 (1 mM) in a final volume of 50 ll. The reaction was carried out for 15 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of ice-cold sodium phosphate (pH 7.4, 0.1 M, and 50 ll). An aliquot (90 ll) of the reaction mixture was added to an AG1X8 ion-exchange resin to capture NAA [3 H]G; [3 H]G product was eluted with 1 M formate and the radioactivity measured with a scintillation counter. The data are the average of 5 independent experiments. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation for each determination. Signal to blank ratios at substrate concentrations around Km and Vmax values were 40- and 3-fold, respectively. Specific counts per minute (total counts ) blank counts) around Km and Vmax were about 1200 and 3000, respectively.

tious and efficient. The assay volume was reduced 20fold compared to the previous radioactivity-based assay so that rate vs substrate concentration profiles (Æ inhibitor) are more practical to determine. Work-up steps were developed to accommodate the new format; one major modification was the use of solid scintillator technology that significantly reduced radioactive waste. It is now possible to monitor saturation of GCPII with NAAG at micromolar concentrations without high levels of radioactivity. We used the new protocol to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters of the hydrolysis of NAAG catalyzed by GCPII and to determine the equilibrium constant for the binding of GCPII and 2-PMPA. The modified procedure was also used successfully to determine GCPII activity in sciatic nerve preparations (data not shown) and it could potentially be used to monitor GCPII activity in other enzyme sources like prostate or brain membranes.

To our knowledge, this is the first time the turnover number (kcat Þ and consequently the catalytic efficiency (kcat =Km Þ values for GCPII are reported in the literature. The turnover number for GCPII (4 sÀ1 Þ is low when compared to those for other enzymes like carbonic anhydrase (600,000 sÀ1 Þ [14]. On the other hand, it is not unusual; it is in the same order of magnitude as the turnover number reported for DNA polymerase (15 sÀ1 Þ, tryptophan synthetase (2 sÀ1 Þ and lysozyme (0:5 sÀ1 Þ [14]. NAAG exhibited tight binding to GCPII (Km ¼ 130 nM) in accordance with previous reports where Km is in the range 87­540 nM [1,13]. The Km exhibits variability because it is in the range where the reaction rate is linear with respect to substrate concentration where small differences in substrate concentration translate into significant changes in rate that correspondingly affect the Km determination. GCPII exhibits a high catalytic efficiency (kcat =Km ¼ 3 Â

107 MÀ1 sÀ1 Þ, similar to the catalytic efficiency of carbonic anhydrase [15]. In short, GCPII exhibits high catalytic efficiency despite low turnover rate due to tight binding of NAAG to GCPII. Equilibrium constants for the binding of enzyme and inhibitor (Ki Þ are more rigorously determined from rate vs substrate concentration profiles in the presence of various fixed inhibitor concentrations [16]. The Ki for 2PMPA we report here (0.2 nM) is similar to the Ki value reported earlier [11]. The earlier value was inferred from the IC50 , the inhibitor concentration required to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity at a specific substrate concentration. The Ki and the IC50 are similar for a competitive inhibitor when the IC50 is determined at substrate concentrations well below the Km [17]. The Ki for 2-PMPA reported earlier was carried out with a brain membrane preparation as GCPII source [11]; the Ki we report here was obtained with the purified extracellular portion of human recombinant GCPII comprising amino acids 44­750 [10]. Even though recombinant GCPII does not contain the transmembrane domain and it could exhibit differences in glycosylation when compared to native GCPII, the Km for NAAG and

Ki for 2-PMPA are the same when using the two GCPII sources, suggesting that the recombinant enzyme is a reasonable approximation to the native enzyme. The inhibition of GCPII by 2-PMPA (Fig. 2) exhibited the hallmarks of competitive inhibition: no change in Vmax and increase in Km app as the concentration of 2PMPA was increased. The rate constant of association for GCPII and 2-PMPA (kon Þ was reported recently as 3 Â 107 MÀ1 sÀ1 [18]. Interestingly, this value is the same as kcat =Km for GCPII and NAAG determined from steady-state kinetics experiments. This ratio is the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction rate expression between substrate and enzyme and it is also a measure of specificity for competing molecules [15]. If we take kcat =Km as the rate of association for GCPII and NAAG (k1 Þ we can estimate the rate constant of dissociation for NAAG (kÀ1 Þ from the equation for Km obtained from the Michaelis­Menten kinetics mechanism: Km ¼ ðkÀ1 þ kcat Þ=k1 [14]. Solving for kÀ1 and substituting Km ; kcat and k1 for the corresponding values noted above give kÀ1 $ 0 sÀ1 . Even though this result is an approximation, it clearly suggests that most of the NAAG that binds GCPII goes on to form substrate.

Fig. 3. Comparison of rate constants for NAAG and 2-PMPA in their reaction with GCPII.

Fig. 3 illustrates the similarities and differences between NAAG and 2-PMPA when encountering GCPII as suggested by the kinetic experiments: GCPII equally recognizes both NAAG and 2- PMPA. However, in the case of NAAG, the enzyme substrate complex goes on to form products and free enzyme (kcat ¼ 4 sÀ1 Þ; very little dissociates back to substrate. Recycled enzyme has an equal probability to bind NAAG or 2-PMPA. In the case of 2-PMPA, the rate constant of dissociation to free enzyme and inhibitor (koff Þ is 0.01 sÀ1 [18], a rate approximately 400 times slower than the catalytic rate. As a result, 2-PMPA effectively ``locks'' the enzyme in a noncatalytic mode. In summary, we used a microplate assay to determine kcat ; Km , and kcat =Km for the hydrolysis of NAAG catalyzed by GCPII and to determine the Ki for the inhibition of GCPII by 2-PMPA. The results provide a kinetic insight on the nature of catalysis by GCPII and on the inhibition of the enzyme by 2-PMPA. References
