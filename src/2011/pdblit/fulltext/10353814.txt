ABSTRACT: Organophosphorus acid anhydride (OP) nerve agents are potent inhibitors which rapidly phosphonylate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and then may undergo an internal dealkylation reaction (called "aging") to produce an OP-enzyme conjugate that cannot be reactivated. To understand the basis for irreversible inhibition, we solved the structures of aged conjugates obtained by reaction of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE) with diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP), O-isopropylmethylphosponofluoridate (sarin), or O-pinacolylmethylphosphonofluoridate (soman) by X-ray crystallography to 2.3, 2.6, or 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. The highest positive difference density peak corresponded to the OP phosphorus and was located within covalent bonding distance of the active-site serine (S200) in each structure. The OP-oxygen atoms were within hydrogen-bonding distance of four potential donors from catalytic subsites of the enzyme, suggesting that electrostatic forces significantly stabilize the aged enzyme. The active sites of aged sarin- and soman-TcAChE were essentially identical and provided structural models for the negatively charged, tetrahedral intermediate that occurs during deacylation with the natural substrate, acetylcholine. Phosphorylation with DFP caused an unexpected movement in the main chain of a loop that includes residues F288 and F290 of the TcAChE acyl pocket. This is the first major conformational change reported in the active site of any AChE-ligand complex, and it offers a structural explanation for the substrate selectivity of AChE.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE1) is an especially efficient serine hydrolase that catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) at cholinergic synapses (reviewed in ref 1). The

reaction of AChE with carboxyl ester substrates, including ACh, is believed to proceed through an unstable tetrahedral intermediate (TI) before collapsing to a short-lived (t1/2 50 µs) acetyl-enzyme (2) (Scheme 1). The acetyl-enzyme subsequently undergoes nucleophilic attack by water, passing through a second TI, and the regenerated enzyme is expelled as the leaving group (deacylation). The two-step catalytic

Scheme 2: Reaction of AChE with a Phosphonate Nerve Agenta

Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 22, 1999 7033

a The scheme begins with the reversible enzyme-OP complex and ends with irreversibly inhibited aged enzyme. The phosphylation leaving group is depicted as X (fluoride ion in the case of soman, sarin, or DFP); the enzyme's catalytic general base, probably N 2 of His440, is depicted as :B; R is a branched alkyl group; and R+ is a hypothetical carbonium ion which reacts in water to yield primarily the alcohol product, ROH (9). The top panel shows phosphylation, and the lower panel shows dealkylation (aging). Phosphonylation is expected to occur via a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate (depicted in brackets in the upper panel), or a transition state resembling such a structure, with inversion of stereochemistry at P. For reaction of AChE with DFP, an -OiPr group replaces the -CH3 bonded to P.

mechanism renders AChE susceptible to rapid, stoichiometric, and essentially irreversible inhibition by a class of organophosphorus acid anhydride (OP) inhibitors, typified by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) and the phosphonate nerve agents, which can act as "hemisubstrates" to trap the enzyme in a structure that closely resembles the negatively charged deacylation TI (3) (Scheme 2). Unlike the intermediates formed with carboxyl esters, the OP-enzyme persists for many hours or days (reviewed in ref 4). Slow hydrolysis has been explained by steric exclusion; the active-site histidine (H440) is not positioned to carry a water molecule to the correct face of the phosphorus required for nucleophilic attack (5, 6). It also has been proposed that H440 is rendered ineffective as a general base because the imidazolium forms an unproductive hydrogen bond with an oxygen atom of the OP (7). After phosphylation2 of the active-site serine, some OPAChE conjugates undergo post-inhibitory reactions, collectively called "aging", which result in truly irreversible enzyme inhibition (Scheme 2). The best-characterized aging reaction is that of AChE inhibited by DFP, O-isopropylmethylphosponofluoridate (sarin), or O-pinacolylmethylphosphonofluoridate (soman). These inhibitors possess a branched alkyl group (Figure 1) which has been proposed to undergo dealkylation by a carbonium ion mechanism, thereby adding a formal negative charge to the active site of phosphylated AChE (8, 9). The X-ray crystallographic structure of Torpedo californica (Tc) AChE (10) and computer-based homology models of human (Hu) AChE (11) and the closely related serum enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE; refs 12, 13), combined with site-directed mutagenesis studies, have permitted tentative identification of the specific amino acid residues which constitute several catalytic subsites, including an "oxyanion hole" (14), a hydrophobic acyl pocket, and a trimethylamThe term "phosphylated" denotes phosphorylation and phosphonylation reactions without distinction.

monium (choline) binding site (reviewed in ref 15). Direct demonstration of these subsites with natural substrates has not been achieved because of the inherent instability of the intermediates that form during carboxyl ester hydrolysis. Our goal was to solve the three-dimensional structures of aged phosphylated TcAChE as a means of (1) understanding the forces that oppose reactivation (dephosphylation) of the OPenzyme, and (2) providing structural models for the deacylation TI of carboxyl ester hydrolysis which could validate the topography of the AChE active site. MATERIALS AND METHODS Enzyme Purification and Characterization. TcAChE was purified as described (16), and the steady-state constants for its reactions with acetylthiocholine (ATCh), butyrylthiocholine (BTCh), and DFP were measured using previously described methods (17, 18). Briefly, the catalytic activity was determined for substrates ATCh and BTCh by the spectrophotometric method of Ellman (19). Substrate Michaelis constants (Km) and catalytic rate constants (kcat) were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots and from direct nonlinear curve fitting of the rate equation. The steady-state dissociation constant (Kd) and phosphorylation rate constant (k2) for the reaction of DFP with TcAChE were measured by monitoring continuous inhibition curves in the presence of excess substrate (ATCh) (18, 20). All kinetic experiments were done in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 24 °C. Crystallization of OP-TcAChE Conjugates. Purified TcAChE was inhibited with DFP, sarin, or soman.3 DFP and sarin were used at 300-fold molar excess to enzyme, and soman was used at 2100-fold molar excess. The aging reaction proceeded to >95% completion; aliquots of the OP-TcAChE conjugates could not be reactivated by 20 h incubation with either 10 mM pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide or 1,1trimethylene-bis(4-formylpyridinium bromide) dioxime. Unbound OP was removed by gel filtration before the crystallization experiments. OP-TcAChE conjugates were crystallized in hanging drops by the vapor diffusion method. Protein crystallized at a concentration of 10 mg/mL from a precipitating solution of 35-40% w/v PEG-200 (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in 0.15 M MES buffer, 0.05 M NaCl, pH 5.8-6.0 at 4 °C.
3 The OP inhibitors are extremely toxic; sarin and soman were handled according to established regulations governing chemical warfare materials.

Although suitable crystals appeared spontaneously after 5-10 days, their quality was improved by seeding with microscopic crystalline fragments. X-ray Diffraction and Data Processing. The exterior mother liquor that surrounds the crystals during their growth was exchanged with high-viscosity motor oil (Exxon, Houston, TX), and the crystals subsequently were flashcooled in liquid nitrogen (21). X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K. Data for the DFP and soman conjugates were collected at the Weizmann Institute of Science using a Rigaku rotating anode FR300 (50 mA, 50 kV) source ( ) 1.54 Å) with a Rigaku Raxis-II detector. For the sarin conjugate, data were collected using the U.S. National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory on beamline X12C ( ) 1.1 Å), with a 2 × 2 Brandeis charge-coupled device detector. Data collection parameters were optimized using the computer program STRATEGY (22), and intensity data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (23). Model Refinement. The 2.5 Å structure of native TcAChE (2ace in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, PDB) (24) was used to obtain the initial models by rigid-body refinement and simulated annealing (25). The solvent, carbohydrate, and OP atoms subsequently were built into (Fo - Fc) electron density difference maps. All three structures were refined by a combination of simulated annealing and torsion angle molecular dynamics with a maximum likelihood target function, using the programs of Crystallography & NMR System, CNS v.0.5 (26, 27). The quality of the refined structures was assessed using PROCHECK (28) and WHATIF (29). The CR atom positions of the OP-TcAChE structures were compared with those of native TcAChE using PROFIT (SciTech Software, University College, London). The program INSIGHTII v.97.0 (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA) was used to calculate the positions of hydrogen atoms, to generate theoretical solvent-accessible surfaces, and to produce the final figures. RESULTS Reaction Kinetics. The reaction rate constants of TcAChE with ATCh, BTCh, or DFP were similar to those of HuAChE, but considerably different from those of HuBChE (Table 1). For example, the Kd for the reversible complex of TcAChE and DFP was 6-fold less than that measured for HuAChE using identical methodology (18), but it was over 1200-fold less than that measured for HuBChE (Table 1).

Fc) maps corresponded to the phosphorus of the OP and was observed to be within covalent bonding distance of the S200 O in all three structures (Figure 2). Only one peak of this magnitude was found in each structure; this result confirmed that OP nerve agents form a covalent bond exclusively with the active-site serine of AChE (30). The overall orientation of the bound OP, relative to the active-site gorge, was comparable in all three structures (Figures 3 and 4). There were no detectable alterations in the geometry of the active-site triad (S200-H440-E327) of the aged OP-TcAChE structures, compared with that of native TcAChE. A water molecule that is normally present within hydrogen-bond distance of the oxyanion hole in the active site of native TcAChE (water no. 682 in 2ace) was displaced by the OP in each structure.

X-ray Structures of Phosphylated TcAChE

Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 22, 1999 7035 At completion of the post-inhibitory aging process, the final reaction product was an anionic methylphosphonylated (MeP)-AChE in the case of sarin and soman, or an anionic monoisopropylphosphorylated (MiPrP)-AChE with DFP (Figure 4). Direct observation of the dealkylated OPs after aging proves that the original interpretations of low-molecular-mass product analysis (8, 9) and recent mass spectrometric data (32) were fundamentally correct. In all three aged OP-TcAChE structures, the oxygen atom of the OP that underwent dealkylation (designated O in Scheme 2) was oriented toward a polar pocket in the active site that contained several water molecules (corresponding to waters no. 633, 678, 679, and 742 in 2ace). At least one of these waters (no. 742 in 2ace) must move to accommodate the alkyl group that departs during aging. The geometry between O and H440 N 2 was consistent with the presence of an imidazolium at H440 that could act as a hydrogenbond donor (Table 3). The overall root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) for CR atoms, relative to native TcAChE, was only 0.3 Å for each MeP-AChE structure and 0.4 Å for MiPrP-AChE. There was an unexpected conformational change, however, in the activesite acyl pocket of the MiPrP-AChE structure. The side chains of F288 and F290 moved significantly, and the main chain underwent "peptide flips" (33) between I287 and S291 to accommodate one of the isopropyl groups of DFP (Figures 4C and 5). The -dihedral angle for I287 changed by 184°, moving from  ) 140° in native TcAChE to  ) -44° in MiPrP-AChE. This flip in the I287 -dihedral angle was offset by successive changes in the -dihedral angles for R289, F290, and S291. The calculated deviation for the CR atoms in residues 287-291 in the MiPrP-AChE structure, compared with native TcAChE, was 0.6, 2.9, 4.8, 2.2, and 0.8 Å, respectively. A more subtle repositioning of F331 by rotation around its 1 and 2 angles also occurred in the MiPrP-AChE acyl pocket (not shown). The phenyl ring of F331 moved and partially filled the space created by displacement of the phenyl ring of F288. The conformational change in MiPrP-AChE did not appear to be a consequence of the dealkylation reaction (aging), because no evidence was found for a significant conformational change in the other two aged structures. Moreover, the residues in the acyl pocket of the sarin conjugate showed no detectable movement, despite the fact that both DFP and sarin lose an identical isopropyl group during the dealkylation reaction (Scheme 2). DISCUSSION Serine hydrolases may catalyze the phosphylation and aging reactions with OP inhibitors containing branched alkyl groups, and thus greatly accelerate their own irreversible inhibition (7, 34). The remarkably large rate enhancement of the aging reaction by cholinesterase has been ascribed to the precise juxtaposition of the departing alkyl group with specific amino acid residues in the enzyme active site (35-37). The aged OP-TcAChE structures do not permit direct observation of the alkyl group that departs during dealkylation, but its general topography on the enzyme surface can be deduced from the steric constraints of the phosphylated active site (38). On the basis of the position of the residual

The final, refined active site of aged MeP-AChE, obtained by reaction with soman, is superimposed on the initial (Fo - Fc) electron density map (30-2.2 Å all data; map contour level 3) after rigid-body refinement of the protein, but before including the OP moiety in the refinement. Only density that is within 2.0 Å of the soman atoms is contoured. Note that the tetrahedral geometry of the soman phosphorus atom was clearly apparent in the initial, unbiased difference maps.

FIGURE 3: Orientation of the bound OP relative to the active-site gorge. The structure depicted is that of aged MeP-TcAChE (soman) viewed down the PdO bond with the oxyanion hole oxygen atom (not visible) directly behind the phosphorus atom (colored purple). The position of the phosphonylated serine (OP-S200) is shown relative to those of the thirteen aromatic side chains that line the active-site gorge of AChE (10). The solvent-accessible surface (spherical probe of 1.4 Å radius) was calculated for 16 Å around the OP (grey mesh). Note that the OP methyl group is buried in a hydrophobic patch formed by W233, F288, and F290, but the oxygen that undergoes dealkylation (O Scheme 2) points toward a solvent-accessible pocket in front of W84.

The strong stereoselectivity of AChE ensured that, under our experimental conditions, the primary OP reactants were the PS stereoisomers of sarin and soman (31). The MePAChE structures establish the stereochemistry of the final reaction products and, thereby, demonstrate an overall inversion of the absolute configuration at the OP phosphorus (Figure 4). Inversion is consistent with a simple in-line nucleophilic attack by the S200 O during phosphylation (Scheme 2), but the structures do not exclude more complicated reaction mechanisms.

FIGURE 4: Active site of aged phosphylated TcAChE determined by X-ray crystallography. The three-dimensional structures depicted were obtained by reaction of TcAChE with soman (A), sarin (B), or DFP (C). Note the proximity of four hydrogen-bond donors (dashed lines) to the anionic phosphonyl oxygen atoms: the backbone amide-nitrogen atoms of A201, G118, and G119, as well as H440 N 2. In the MeP-AChE structures (panels A and B), the OP methyl carbon is within nonbonded contact distances (dotted lines) of F288 and F290 in the acyl pocket. In contrast, reaction with DFP results in a distortion of the acyl pocket (panel C). F288 and F290 move significantly in the MiPrP-AChE structure (green), compared with their positions in the native enzyme (purple). For reference, the CR traces of native (pink) and MiPrP-AChE (green) are overlaid.

oxygen atom (O Scheme 2), the bond that breaks during aging is close to the imidazole ring of H440 (Table 3). Furthermore, the departed alkyl group would have filled the solvent-accessible pocket in front of the indole ring of W84 (Figure 3). Dealkylation occurs selectively in this site because the crystal structure shows that DFP lost exclusively the isopropyl group in front of W84, while the residual isopropyl group in the acyl pocket is present at full occupancy. The deduced position of the departed alkyl group in the crystal structures explains several biochemical features of the aging reaction in solution: (1) the catalytic histidine participates in aging (34, 39); (2) dealkylation occurs preferentially in the choline binding subsite (8, 40, 41), which is now widely accepted to be W84 (10, 42); and (3) aging rate constants for OPs with branched alkyl groups are reduced 60-1100-fold by the site-specific replacement of W86(84)4 in HuAChE (36, 43). The negative charge introduced by the departure of an alkyl group during aging imposes an important barrier to

dephosphylation because anionic phosphoesters are inherently resistant to nucleophilic attack (44). Electrostatic repulsion alone, however, does not adequately explain the truly irreversible character of aged enzyme. The presence of a negative charge retards nucleophilic attack of simple phosphorus diesters by only approximately 50-100-fold (45), and reactivation of anionic OP-chymotrypsin conjugates by an intramolecular nucleophile is possible (46). Furthermore, protein denaturation of aged MiPrP-AChE permits significant base-catalyzed dephosphorylation (47), suggesting that the resistance of aged OP-AChE to reactivation must be partly caused by specific structural interactions between the folded enzyme and the OP.

Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 22, 1999 7037 (1gmh) (53), and an MeP-esterase (from Streptomyces scabies; 1esd) (54). The presence of a hydrogen bond is consistent with the conclusion that the catalytic histidine N 2 is immobilized in a protonated form in the aged enzyme, thereby locking the phosphylated active site in an electrostatic and structural analogue of the natural substrate TI (55). Structural Models for the Deacylation Tetrahedral Intermediate. The active sites of aged MeP-AChE (sarin and soman) provide the best available structural analogues for the negatively charged, deacylation TI formed during reaction with the natural substrate, ACh (55, 56). One phosphonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole mimics the carbonyl oxygen in the substrate TI (14), while the other oxgyen atom interacts with the H440 imidazolium. Thus, the anionic OP adduct strongly complements the preformed electrostatic environment of the AChE active site (reviewed in ref 57). Additionally, the position of the methyl group of sarin and soman should closely approximate that of the ACh methyl group (Scheme 1). Both F288 and F290 provide close nonbonded contacts to the sarin or soman methyl group (Figure 4), supporting the hypothesis that these aromatic side chains also bind the ACh methyl group in the substrate TI (42). The side chain of W233 is proximal to the methyl group in the MeP-AChE structure (deacylation TI analog), as well as to the CF3 group in the structure of TcAChE inhibited with m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)-2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone (TMTFA; 42) (acylation TI analog) (Table 3). Furthermore, W233 is absolutely conserved in AChE and BChE, as is the adjacent P232 that constrains the position of the indole ring. The proximity and invariant position of W233 suggest to us a more general and primary role for this acyl pocket residue in catalysis; replacement of W233 in HuBChE was shown recently to result in a 32-fold decrease in the kcat for substrate hydrolysis (58). MoVement of the Acyl Pocket in MiPrP-AChE. Structureactivity studies first suggested the presence of specific binding pockets in the active site of cholinesterase that interact with the acyl and alkoxy groups of carboxyl ester substrates and OP inhibitors (reviewed in refs 6, 59). This approach showed convincingly that the acyl pocket of AChE was more restrictive than that of BChE. After the crystal structure of TcAChE became available, two aromatic residues, F288 and F290, were implicated as the source of AChE selectivity on the basis of sequence alignments and sitespecific mutagenesis data (reviewed in ref 15). Movement of F288 and F290 during the reaction with DFP, but not with sarin or soman (Figure 4), supports the idea that the aromatic side chains of these residues are the primary source of acyl pocket selectivity in TcAChE. Previous molecular dynamics studies of TcAChE suggested either that the degrees of freedom available to substrates and inhibitors were restricted by F288 and F290 or that the side chains underwent compensatory movements to accommodate bulky ligands; the models did not predict that the polypeptide backbone atoms in the acyl pocket could move almost 5 Å (Figure 5). Concurrent movement of the phenyl rings of F331, F288, and F290 suggests that a network of cooperative - interactions may stabilize the acyl-binding pocket in native TcAChE. The free-energy penalty associated with the observed conformational change in the acyl pocket offers a concrete explanation for the substrate specificity of TcAChE. The

a Hydrogen bonds were considered possible if the straight-line distance between an appropriate donor and acceptor atom was e3.5 Å and the angle from donor-hydrogen-acceptor atom was g120°. For calculation of the angles, the positions of the putative hydrogen atoms were determined from the geometry of the heavy atom positions using INSIGHTII. b The residual oxygen atom after dealkylation (depicted as O in Scheme 2). c The oxygen atom in the oxyanion hole (depicted as O in Scheme 2). d Straight-line distance from the methyl carbon atom of the phosphonate, or from the CF3-carbon atom of TMTFA (42), to the geometric center of the phenyl or benzopyrrole ring of the indicated side chain. e Straight-line distance to G119 CR.

noncovalent forces that contribute to the irreversible inhibition which is characteristic of OP nerve agents. Three possible hydrogen bonds from the oxyanion hole (main-chain nitrogen atoms of G118, G119, and A201) to one phosphonyl oxygen atom stabilize the bound OP adduct before and after aging (Table 3). Indeed, this interaction may be strengthened by dealkylation (aging) because electronic rearrangement could place the formal negative charge of the aged OP adduct partly or entirely in the dipolar oxyanion hole. It was shown by site-specific mutagenesis that replacement of the oxyanion hole residues equivalent to either G118 or G119 in HuAChE and HuBChE markedly slows the reaction rate constants for OP inhibitors (48-50). The acyl pocket provides another barrier to reactivation. A "dry" hydrophobic patch formed by F288, F290, W233, and G119 CR completely surrounds one OP alkyl (or alkoxyl) group (Table 3; Figure 2). This could limit dephosphylation by blocking access of attacking water molecules to the correct face of the phosphorus, as well as by providing stabilizing nonbonded contacts to the OP in the case of the sarin or soman (Figure 4). The G119 CR is only 4.3 Å away from the phosphorus and is almost in-line with the phosphorusS200 O bond. Placing an imidazole side chain specifically at this position in HuBChE (G117(119)H) confers OP hydrolase activity by increasing spontaneous dephosphylation (49, 51). A key structural feature of aged OP-serine hydrolases appears to be a favorable electrostatic interaction between N 2 of the active-site imidazolium and one oxygen atom of the anionic OP moiety. A hydrogen bond is possible between H440 N 2 (donor) and one oxygen of the OP (acceptor) in each of the three aged OP-TcAChE crystal structures (Table 3). Similar geometry is present in the aged structures of MiPrP-trypsin (PDB code 1ntp) (52), MiPrP-chymotrypsin

FIGURE 5: Conformational change in the acyl pocket. The main chain of MiPrP-AChE (thicker dark sticks) is compared with that of native TcAChE (thinner gray sticks) from position 278 to 292. The main chain displacement in the MiPrP-AChE stems from steric clashes between the bulky isopropyl group of DFP and the side chains of F288 and F290 (indicated by the arrow and also depicted in Figure 4C). The movement occurs on a loop that includes W279 (side chain shown) of the peripheral site. For reference, the CR traces (thin lines) of the superimposed proteins are shown.

reversible dissociation constant with DFP, for example, is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher for either TcAChE or HuAChE than it is for HuBChE (Table 1). Replacement of the acyl pocket residues F295(288) and F297(290) in HuAChE with the smaller aliphatic side chains found in HuBChE abolishes this difference (17, 18). Likewise, the specificity constants for reaction of HuAChE or TcAChE with a substrate containing a butyryl group are 100-450fold lower than those for reaction with an optimal substrate containing a methyl group (Table 1). If TcAChE is phosphorylated with DFP and then rapidly dephosphorylated with an oxime nucleophile before aging can occur, the regenerated enzyme is essentially identical with native enzyme in its substrate specificity and affinity for a range of fluorescent bisquaternary ammonium ligands (38). Therefore, the conformational change we observe is probably reversible upon reactivation. The aging reaction stops dephosphorylation, however, and traps the acyl pocket of aged MiPrP-TcAChE in a conformation that may occur transiently during reaction with some substrates and inhibitors. Because the acyl pocket loop that moves also includes W279, which forms an important part of the AChE peripheral site (reviewed in ref 15), it is reasonable to speculate that this loop conjoins the active site with the peripheral site during catalysis (Figure 5). Such a link was first proposed by Changeux (60) to explain the allosteric binding of certain inhibitors to Torpedo AChE, but it continues to elude firm experimental proof. Despite evidence in the literature for conformational changes associated with aging of some OP-AChE, -BChE, and -chymotrypsin conjugates in solution (61-63), we detected no major structural rearrangements in TcAChE as a result of the aging reaction itself. It remains possible, however, that reversible conformational changes occurred on the pathway to the final aged OP-TcAChE structures. We are testing this possibility by ongoing X-ray crystallographic studies of nonaged OP-TcAChE complexes. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Ms Lilly Toker for valuable technical assistance. Dr. Clarence A.
