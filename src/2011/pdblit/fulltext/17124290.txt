day 1 (P1) (Fig. 4D and fig. S6). Thus, hair follicle clusters in Foxn1::Dkk2 mice form during a normal inductive program by misdistribution of the normal complement of epidermal appendages (Fig. 4D and SOM text 7 and fig. S6). We note that further signaling pathways are involved in interfollicular patterning. Studies on feather development demonstrated that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) promote follicle formation, whereas BMP and EGF signaling confers interfollicular fate (14, 15). Because these pathways appear to be downstream of WNT signaling and exert feedback control (5, 14, 16­19), we propose that they mainly mediate and modulate WNT signals, thereby contributing to the stabilization and refinement of the patterning process. Indeed, ablation of the BMP receptor IA appears to have no major impact on hair follicle induction and distribution (20). However, suppression of BMP signaling that may reduce Dkk1 expression (19) causes an increase in hair follicle density (21), consistent with our simulations (fig. S3C). Given that LEF1 plays an important role in WNT signaling, which controls ectodysplasin signals (5, 22), our results may also explain the misdistribution of follicles in EdaA1 and Lef1 transgenic mice (23, 24). However, a more sophisticated systems biology approach will be needed in the future to include the full complexity and dynamics of the WNT signaling pathway (25) in a model of interfollicular patterning. In conclusion, our combined experimental and computer modeling approach presents compelling evidence for WNT signaling and a reaction-diffusion mechanism as key determinants of hair follicle spacing patterns.

Structural Basis for Ribosome Recruitment and Manipulation by a Viral IRES RNA
Jennifer S. Pfingsten, David A. Costantino, Jeffrey S. Kieft* Canonical cap-dependent translation initiation requires a large number of protein factors that act in a stepwise assembly process. In contrast, internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) are cis-acting RNAs that in some cases completely supplant these factors by recruiting and activating the ribosome using a single structured RNA. Here we present the crystal structures of the ribosomebinding domain from a Dicistroviridae intergenic region IRES at 3.1 angstrom resolution, providing a view of the prefolded architecture of an all-RNA translation initiation apparatus. Docking of the structure into cryo­electron microscopy reconstructions of an IRES-ribosome complex suggests a model for ribosome manipulation by a dynamic IRES RNA. n eukaryotes, there are two known mechanisms for the initiation of protein synthesis (Fig. 1A). The canonical mechanism requires a modified nucleotide cap on the 5 end of the mRNA, which is recognized by an initiation factor protein (eIF4E). This protein recruits other factors that assemble the ribosome on the mRNA in a stepwise process (1). In contrast, internal initiation of translation does not require a cap or recognition of the

mRNA 5 end. Rather, structured RNA sequences called internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) recruit and activate the translation machinery, functionally replacing many protein factors (2). IRESs are essential for infection by many medically and economically important viruses such as hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis A, polio, foot-and-mouth disease, rhinovirus, coxsackievirus-B3, and HIV-1 (3). IRESs also drive the translation of eukaryotic mRNAs, encoding factors involved in development, growth regulation, apoptosis, transcription, translation, and other important cellular processes (3). The molecular rules underlying this RNA structure­driven mechanism remain elusive. VOL 314 SCIENCE

Ideal model systems for understanding IRES RNA-driven translation are the mechanistically streamlined intergenic region (IGR) IRESs of the virus family Dicistroviridae (4). The IGR IRESs drive the association of the ribosomal subunits without any of the protein factors that comprise the canonical translation initiation apparatus (Fig. 1A) (5). Hence, this one structured RNA (molecular size ~ 66 kD) supplants over 1000 kD of structured initiation factor proteins, operating as an allRNA translation initiation apparatus (6­9). The full-length IGR IRES folds in solution into two structurally independent domains (10­13). The larger domain (regions 1 and 2, Fig. 1A and fig. S1) is the ribosomebinding domain. It folds into a compact structure (10) that binds directly to the 40S subunit (10, 12, 13). Cryo­electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of an IGR IRES bound to the ribosome reveal that the IGR IRES binds over the mRNA-binding groove, making contact to and changing the structure of both ribosomal subunits (40S and 60S) (14). However, these cryo-EM structures do not reveal the structure of the IRES, how the IRES structure creates a ribosomebinding site, or which IRES structural features specifically contact and manipulate the ribosome. To address these questions and develop a model for the structural basis of IGR IRESdriven translation, we have solved the structure of the ribosome-binding domain of the Plautia stali intestine virus (PSIV) IGR IRES

RNA using x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 3.1 Å with Rwork = 25.3% and Rfree = 29.4% (Fig. 1B). In the structure, regions 1 and 2 pack side-by-side with stem-loop IV (SL IV) and SL V emerging from the same side of the structure (Fig. 1B). Both stemloops have been shown through mutagenesis and footprinting experiments to make functionally critical direct contact to the 40S subunit (10, 12, 13), and isolated region 2 has been shown to bind to the 40S subunit (12). Thus, the position of SL IV and SL V identifies the side of the structure that is the 40S subunit­binding interface ("top" of the structure in Fig. 1B) and indicates that the 40S subunit recognition surface prefolds before subunit binding. The foundation of this prefolded IRES architecture is helix P2.2 (red, Fig. 1B), which is contacted by bases from multiple IRES elements (J2.3, J2.2, L1.2A, and L1.2B, cyan and green, Fig. 1B). This folded core corresponds to areas of strong protection in hydroxyl-radical probing experiments (fig. S2), providing additional evidence that we have captured the authentic prefolded, unbound form of the IRES RNA (10). Many of the most-conserved bases in the IGR IRESs cluster in this highly structured core region. Our structure suggests that these bases are kept invariant to maintain the specific intramolecular contacts that knit the structure together. The two stem-loops are positioned together to contact a relatively small area on the ribosome by a set of specific intramolecular contacts involving pseudoknot III (PK III) and helix P2.2, which form a continuous helical stack that extends into PK II (Fig. 1B). The placement of SL IV is facilitated by underwinding of helix P2.2, which opens the normally deep and narrow major groove (Fig. 2A). The degree of underwinding is such that a single turn of helix covers a total rise of ~ 42 Å, as compared to ~34 Å for canonical A-form RNA. This feature is induced by four key bases that stack into the helix, forming two noncanonical base pairs and anchoring the 3 end of SL IV (J2.3, Fig. 2A). The 5 end of SL IV is anchored by a G-U wobble pair (G6110-U6082, Fig. 2B) (12). From these anchors in the P2.2 major groove, the stem of SL IV is closed with a U·U pair, the bases of which are flipped out from the P2.2 major groove (U6083-U6096, Fig. 2B). Whereas SL IV nestles in the major groove, SL V is positioned by several conserved bases that force the stem of SL V to emerge from the minor groove, placing it at nearly a right angle to P2.2 and adjacent to SL IV (Fig. 2C). Classic pseudoknot folding is characterized by two stacked helices and two single-stranded loops; the 5-most loop crosses the major groove, whereas the other crosses the minor groove (15). Hence, in the IGR IRES, this classic pseudoknot architecture is maintained, despite the fact that both loops contain a large amount of embedded structured RNA (fig. S3). Region 1 does not participate directly in the interactions that create the 40S subunit­ binding site; rather, it packs against region 2 in position to contact the 60S subunit (vide infra). Regions 1 and 2 pack in an interaction in which the large L1.2 loop (green, Fig. 2D) cradles one strand of helix P2.2 (red, Fig. 2D). One strand of this loop (L1.2A) lies along the minor groove of P2.2, forming stabilizing A-minor interactions [for discussions of A-minor interactions, see (16)]. The other strand of the loop (L1.2B) forms the other half of the cradle; apparently poised to enter the major groove, it loops back to the minor groove to form more stabilizing Aminor interactions. The tight, complex packing of RNA that is essential for function is especially evident in this region, where five strands of RNA trace in close proximity. The

A6105 (red) stacks into the helix, forming a noncanonical A·A N7-amino base pair with A6098 of J2.3 (cyan). A6135 (red) stacks on A6098 and forms a reverse (parallel) Watson-Crick A-U pair with conserved base U6097 of J2.3 (cyan).

Region 1 bases (green) buttress this structure through A-minor interactions. (C) The U6082-G6110 pairing extrudes U6130 from the helix and induces a sharp turn in the backbone. Bases A6129 and A6128 stack on the minor groove of the PK III helix, starting the base stacking that extends into SL V.

Bases U6044 and U6045 of L1.2B continue to stack on the PK II stack, whereas A6046-A6048 form a u-turn­like structure (27), allowing A6049 and A6050 to reach the minor groove of P2.2.

The 40S subunit H77 is in yellow, the cryo-EM (L1 stalk) density of the IRES is in SL IV gray, and the IRES crystal structure is colored as in Fig. 1. The positions of rpS5 (40S subunit) and SL IV and SL V (IGR IRES) are shown. (B) Detailed view of the interaction of the IGR IRES to the 60S subunit within the 80S ribosome­IRES complex, with the 40S subunit density computationally removed. The L1 stalk of the 60S subunit contacts IRES loop L1.1 and perhaps P1.1. For both (A) and (B), the orientation is indicated in the insets.

other parts of regions 1 and 2 (helix P1.1 and loop L1.1) are only weakly visible in the electron density. We built RNA structure into this weak density, but the structure is poorly defined in these regions, indicating conformational flexibility. Hence, although we can clearly see where L1.1 lies in relation to the rest of the structure, we cannot report its highresolution structure. This flexibility corresponds to the fact that the RNA crystallized as a domain-swapped dimer in which the native interactions between regions 1 and 2 are preserved (for a detailed discussion, see fig. S4). Hence, the IRES contains regions of stable, highly structured RNA and other regions of flexible, less stable structure. We examined the functional significance of this observation by combining our structure with existing cryo-EM reconstruction data (14). To identify the specific IGR IRES RNA structures that contact the ribosome, we docked the crystal structure into published cryo-EM reconstructions (Fig. 3). To generate a model for docking, we returned the SL IV and SL V stems to their wild-type lengths [these were changed to induce crystallization (17)]. With the use of the location of the 3 end of the IRES RNA, assignments of region 3 and regions 1 and 2 into the cryo-EM maps (14), footprinting and directed hydroxylradical probing data (12, 18), and the overall agreement of the crystal structure with the shape of the cryo-EM density, the docking orientation was unambiguous (fig. S5) (12, 14, 18). Based on the good, but not perfect, match of the structure to the cryo-EM density, we conclude that the IRES does not need to undergo a global structural rearrangement to match our structure. Rather, local structural shifts (such as a change in the relative angle of helices or a shift of region 1 relative to region 2) occur upon binding. The docking and fit are robust enough to identify the IRES RNA structural domains that contact the 40S and 60S subunits and to suggest a dynamic mechanism of IRES action. Cryo-EM showed that small ribosomal protein S5 (rpS5) makes contact with the IGR IRES (14), and our docked structure reveals that SL IV and SL V are the features that interact with rpS5 (Fig. 3A). These are the only IRES contacts to rpS5, indicating that this is the keystone interaction that drives 40S subunit binding, induces conformational change, and begins the translation initiation process. This observation is supported by data showing that mutation of these loops abrogates 40S subunit binding and translation initiation activity (10, 12, 13). The apical loop sequences of SL IV and SL V are conserved almost universally among the IGR IRESs, underscoring that their specific interaction with rpS5 is critical for function (fig. S6). The HCV IRES also contacts rpS5, and the HCV IRES domain that contacts rpS5 also

changes the conformation of the 40S subunit (19­21), suggesting that this interaction is central to this mode of IRES RNA-driven translation. In the docked structure, IRES loop L1.1 (and perhaps adjacent helices) is positioned to make direct contact with the large subunit's L1 stalk, which contains rpL1 and ribosomal RNA helix H77 (Fig. 3B) (14). That L1.1 and the adjacent P1.1 helix are poorly ordered suggests this part of the IRES is not stably folded until it interacts with the 60S subunit. During translation, the L1 stalk interacts with the T loop of E site­bound tRNA (22, 23), which suggests that IGR IRES loop L1.1, when bound in the 80S ribosome, adopts a structure that mimics this portion of tRNA structure. Like the 40S subunit­binding stemloops, IRES loop L1.1 is highly conserved, demonstrating the importance and specificity of its interactions with the L1 stalk (fig. S6) (4, 11). Our observation that L1.1 makes an important contact to the 60S subunit predicts that mutating L1.1 will block translation initiation after 40S subunit binding. To test this prediction, we constructed two mutants and used them in preinitiation complex assays analyzed on sucrose gradients (Fig. 4, A to C). Both mutants produce IRES­40S subunit complexes but fail to progress to 80S ribosomes, demonstrating that L1.1 is critical for recruitment of the 60S subunit. Neither of these mutations globally misfold the RNA (Fig. 4B), which suggests that the effect is due to the loss of the direct L1.1 interaction with the 60S subunit. The IRES interactions with rpS5 and the L1 stalk are the only intimate contacts to regions 1 and 2 in our docked structure. This does not preclude that other interactions may occur, especially upon proposed subtle conformational changes to the IRES. However, the fact that the conservation of nucleotides in regions 1 and 2 of the IRES is fully accounted for by the folded core and contacts with rpS5 and the L1 stalk suggests that other contacts may be nonspecific in nature (fig. S6). Our structure of the PSIV IGR IRES ribosome-binding domain, combined with a wealth of published biochemical, functional, and low-resolution structural data, suggests a mechanistic model for the structural basis of IGR IRES-driven initiation that involves programmed regions of stable and flexible structure (Fig. 4D). We propose that P1.1 and L1.1 remain flexible when the IRES binds to the 40S subunit through structured SL IV and SL V (Fig. 4D, step 1). Support for this idea comes from a close examination of the IRES structure docked into the cryo-EM density of the 40S subunit­bound IRES. The part of the density that corresponds to L1.1 and P1.1 is weak or missing (14) (red oval, Fig. 4D). In the 40S-bound form, IRES region 3 overlaps with the P and A sites (14). 60S subunit binding (Fig. 4D, step 2) results in structural changes in the IRES and a shift that withdraws region 3 from the A and P sites, as well as a change in the structure of the ribosome's L1 stalk that is similar to changes associated with elongation factor binding (14, 24, 25). These IRES structural changes are explained by a 60S subunit binding­induced organization of L1.1 and perhaps P1.1, evident in the appearance of additional cryo-EM density around L1.1 and P1.1 upon 60S subunit binding (Fig. 4D) (14). Furthermore, the fact that regions 1 and 2 of the IRES make relatively few inter-region contacts suggests that the two regions can shift relative to one another. Change in the L1.1 and P1.1 structure thus could be linked to PK II and domain 3 through the P2.1 helix. Other ribosome features positioned near the IRES may also be part of this overall mechanism (14). Pestova et al. have reported that the IGR IRES RNAs also can recruit 80S ribosomes directly (18) in what must be a coupled series of events within the context of the assembled 80S ribosome. Although there is great diversity in IRES structure, combining stable and flexible regions may be a strategy used by other IRESs. This structural characteristic is observed in the HCV IRES despite a very different overall RNA architecture (26). Thus, the structure presented here provides the basis for experiments aimed at understanding the basic tenets of RNA-based translation initiation.

(B) Native gel analysis of these mutants shows that they do not globally misfold, because they run very close to wild-type (WT) RNA. Previously published (10) native gel analysis of mutants, in which SL IV and V were changed to GAAA tetraloops (which does not change the fold) and in which PK II was altered (which causes global misfolding), is shown for comparison at right. (C) Assembly assays of L1.1/P1.1 mutants analyzed on a sucrose gradient. The locations of 40S- and 80S-bound IRESs are indicated. CPM, counts per minute. (D) Interactions with the 40S subunit are shown in yellow, and those with the 60S subunit are shown in blue. The IRES is shown as a space-filling representation inside the corresponding gray cryo-EM density, colored as in previous figures. The folded, unbound IRES binds to the 40S subunit through SL IV and SL V interacting with rpS5, inducing a conformational change in the subunit and docking region 3 into the P site (step 1). Subsequent 60S subunit binding induces a series of conformational changes in both the IRES and the ribosome, including a putative organization of IRES structures L1.1 and P1.1 (step 2). The appearance of additional IRES density in the cryo-EM map of the 80S ribosome­bound IRES (indicated with the red oval) supports the existence of this structural switch. www.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 314

Rapid Chemically Induced Changes of PtdIns(4,5)P2 Gate KCNQ Ion Channels
Byung-Chang Suh,1* Takanari Inoue,2* Tobias Meyer,2 Bertil Hille1 To resolve the controversy about messengers regulating KCNQ ion channels during phospholipase C­mediated suppression of current, we designed translocatable enzymes that quickly alter the phosphoinositide composition of the plasma membrane after application of a chemical cue. The KCNQ current falls rapidly to zero when phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PI(4,5)P2] is depleted without changing Ca2+, diacylglycerol, or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Current rises by 30% when PI(4,5)P2 is overproduced and does not change when phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is raised. Hence, the depletion of PI(4,5)P2 suffices to suppress current fully, and other second messengers are not needed. Our approach is ideally suited to study biological signaling networks involving membrane phosphoinositides. hosphoinositide phospholipids are major signaling molecules of cell membranes. Many cellular proteins are inhibited when phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] is hydrolyzed by phospholipase C (PLC) and reactivated when phosphatidylinositol 4phosphate [PI(4)P] 5-kinase restores PI(4,5)P2 (1, 2). For example, KCNQ K+ channels are closed by muscarinic-receptor­triggered PLC activation (3, 4). Closure of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels increases the excitability of central and peripheral neurons, and hypomorphic mutations in KCNQ subunits underlie familial epilepsies, deafness, and arrhythmias (5). Whether the depletion of PI(4,5)P2 suffices to close KCNQ channels upon receptor activation remains controversial because much of the supporting experimental evidence is indirect. Can we rule out that increases of the many signaling molecules downstream of PLC or other changes in phosphoinositides are essential for closing channels instead of or together with the loss of PI(4,5)P2? We used a new method to deplete plasma membrane­associated PI(4,5)P2 in living cells within seconds without activating PLC. Upon addition of a dimerizing drug, PI(4,5)P2 was selectively depleted in living cells without the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), or calcium signals. The chemical dimerizer strategy uses heterodimerization of protein domains from FK506 binding protein (FKBP) and from mTOR (FRB) by the immunosuppressant rapamycin (6) or an analog called iRap (7). This approach has previously permitted us to develop a high-speed membrane translocation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) (7). Now we depleted PI(4,5)P2 by inducible membrane translocation of Inp54p, a yeast inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase that specifically cleaves the phosphate at the 5 position of PI(4,5)P2 (8) (Fig. 1A). Constitutively membrane-targeted Inp54p has VOL 314 SCIENCE

been used to assess the roles of PI(4,5)P2 in cytoskeleton­plasma membrane adhesion (8). We fused a truncated Inp54p to FKBP already tagged with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)­FKBP (CF) (9, 10). The CFP label of the resulting fusion protein CF-Inp54p (CFInp) exhibited good cytosolic localization in NIH3T3 cells. CF-Inp was then cotransfected along with Lyn11-FRB (LDR), a membraneanchored FRB (7), and YFP-PH(PLC-d), a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)­tagged pleckstrin homology (PH) domain from phospholipase C­d1 (PLC-d1) serving as a PI(4,5)P2/IP3 biosensor (11, 12). The addition of iRap led to the translocation of the fluorescent CF-Inp from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and a reciprocal translocation of YFP-PH(PLC-d) from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (Fig. 1, B and H), demonstrating inducible accumulation of the Inp54p enzyme at the plasma membrane and in situ PI(4,5)P 2 depletion. To analyze the kinetics, we measured the fluorescence intensities of CF-Inp and YFP-PH(PLC-d) in a cytosolic region (Fig. 1C), which revealed quick translocation of both probes [half-time (t1/2) = 12.3 ± 1.2 s and 14.7 ± 2.5 s; n = 12 cells from four experiments]. Control experiments with either a phosphatase-dead mutant of Inp54p [CF-Inp Asp281Ala281 (D281A)] (13) or a fusion protein lacking the phosphatase (CF) showed no translocation of YFP-PH(PLC-d), although iRap did induce translocation of the two CFP constructs to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, D to H). We then studied whether PI(4,5)P2 depletion suppresses currents in KCNQ K+ channels in human embryonic kidney tsA-201 (tsA) cells. As controls, iRap alone had only minor, reversible effects on current amplitude and no effect on the voltage dependence of activation of KCNQ current (iRap, ­24.2 ± 1.2 mV; controls, ­23.9 ± 0.7 mV; n = 6 cells). Furthermore, in cells expressing the full Inp54p translocation system together with the M1
