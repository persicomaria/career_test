A protein complex composed of MYB and bHLH transcription factors associated with a WD40 repeat protein initiates multiple cellular differentiation pathways in a range of plants. Recent reports have provided the first coherent models of the network of interactions that lead to diverse cell fates through the activity of this protein complex. The resulting flexibility in plant morphology is likely to have played a major role in angiosperm evolution and success. The complex appears to have arisen in the land plant lineage, although its component parts are considerably more ancient. Here, we review the evolutionary history of the MYB­bHLH­WD40 protein complex and its role in generating plant epidermal cellular diversity.

Introduction The transition from unicellularity to multicellularity necessitated cellular specialization via increased cellular diversity. To achieve cellular diversity and to ensure correct temporal and spatial cellular distribution, signals ­ both external environmental and internal cellular stimuli ­ must be integrated and subsequent regulation of gene expression must be coordinated. Genes encoding proteins that generate and receive signals have broad effects on plant development and the consequences of mutations are likely to be wide ranging and possibly deleterious. Similarly, coding regions of structural genes with key developmental roles are highly conserved and are therefore rarely a source of developmental diversity. However, transcription factors and their DNA binding sequences, which lie in the cis regulatory elements of their target genes, are of central importance to the generation of phenotypic variation. Because transcription factors act in concert with other regulators, the same transcription factor can be used repeatedly, with the outcome of the DNA binding event determined by which other regulators act in concert or opposition. Here, we consider the function of a complex of transcription factors that can include various members of the MYB, basic helix­loop­helix (bHLH) and WD40 protein families. Recent reports have provided insight into how this one complex regulates multiple cell fates and has therefore played a key role in the evolution of cellular diversity in the plant epidermis.

Plant epidermis as a system to investigate cellular diversity The plant epidermis is the first point of contact between the sessile plant and its changing environment. As such, the epidermis fulfils several distinct roles and this multifunctionality makes it an ideal system for the study of evolution of morphological diversity. The plant epidermis primarily provides an impermeable barrier to water, allowing organisms that evolved in the sea to survive in a dehydrating terrestrial atmosphere. Concurrently, the epidermis of vascular plants adapted to allow carbon dioxide to enter as effectively as if an epidermis were absent, an improvement over more basal plant groups, whose pores are unable to respond to changing atmospheric conditions. The secondary functions adopted by the epidermis are variable. Box 1 details the functions of the different epidermal cell types whose specification is discussed below. A common regulatory complex regulates epidermal cell fate A common set of proteins interact to form a regulatory complex that controls epidermal cell identity and ensures appropriate spatial and temporal distribution of specialized epidermal cells. The individual components of this complex are discussed in more detail below. WD40 repeat proteins WD40 repeat proteins comprise a family in the b-propeller protein group, which is characterized by the presence of a 40 residue core region delineated by a glycine­histidine (GH) dipeptide and a tryptophan­aspartate (WD) dipeptide [1]. This motif is tandemly repeated four to 16 times in the same protein. The most extensively studied WD40 repeat protein is the Gb subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction, which forms a seven-bladed b-propeller structure containing seven WD40 repeats. In addition to signal transduction, these proteins are involved in many functions and, given this functional diversity, it is unsurprising that there is little sequence similarity between family members. A common function of WD40 repeat units is that they facilitate protein­protein interactions and have no intrinsic enzymatic function. Several WD40 repeat containing proteins that affect epidermal traits have been identified from petunia (AN11; see Glossary), Arabidopsis (TTG1), Perilla (PFWD) and maize (PAC1; Table 1). These proteins belong

Box 1. Functions of specialized plant epidermal cells Structure and spacing
Pavement cells (Figure Ic, scale barZ50 mm) are the most common epidermal cell type and are morphologically unspecialized, providing mechanical strength while being sufficiently pliable to allow growth. Pavement cells protect subsidiary cell layers and ensure appropriate spacing of morphologically and functionally more specialized epidermal cell types.

Protection against predation
At their simplest, trichomes (Figure Ie, scale barZ50 mm; reproduced, with permission, from Ref. [48]) provide a physical barrier against herbivore attack. More complex trichomes protect the plant by poisoning insects with secretions [49]. They have also been suggested to reduce transpiration and to protect against ultraviolet radiation. The presence of pigments (Figure Ia, scale barZ1.5 cm) and other secondary metabolites could further protect the epidermis by decreasing its palatability [49]. The Arabidopsis trichome is a single cell with three branches and a set of distinct socket cells around the base [50]. Trichomes differentiate while the surrounding epidermal cells are still dividing and their distribution on the Arabidopsis leaf is not random. At the time of initiation, trichome cells are separated by an average of three intervening cells, a separation that cannot at this stage be attributed to a cell lineage based mechanism [50].

Regulation of water loss and gaseous exchange
Stomata (Figure Ib, scale barZ50 mm) are necessary for water retention while allowing the gaseous exchange essential for photosynthesis [45]. Stomatal spacing is non-random and partially cell lineage dependent. The pattern of stomatal initials is modified by interactions between developing complexes, interactions between stomata and other epidermal cells and environmental inputs [46].

Nutrient uptake
Root hairs (Figure Id, scale barZ20 mm) are unicellular tip-growing structures that increase the root surface area for nutrient and water uptake. Arabidopsis root hair development is controlled by positional cues, with root hairs located over the join of adjacent cortical cells beneath [47]. The cell-to-cell communication required for root hair cell fate determination begins during embryo development, with positional information from underlying cell layers breaking the initial symmetry of root epidermal hair files and establishing a pattern over which cellular differentiation is determined [23,46].

Attraction of pollinators
Epidermal cells can be specialized to attract pollinators by the production of colourful pigments (Figure Ia; [51]), the release of scent [52] or the adoption of specialized conical shapes (Figure If) that enhance aspects of light and heat capture [53]. It is also possible that petal epidermal cell shape could be used by bees as a tactile cue in flower discrimination or to enhance scent volatilization [53].

transcriptional regulators MyoD and Myc [9]. The basic region of the bHLH domain is responsible for sequencespecific DNA binding to a consensus hexanucleotide E-box, CANNTG [10], whereas the HLH region allows homo- and heterodimer formation [11]. Lc is involved in

maize tissue-specific anthocyanin pigmentation and was the first plant bHLH protein to be isolated [12]. Mutant analyses have identified additional plant bHLH proteins involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis (Table 1). These proteins show substantial amino acid conservation throughout the protein. Overexpression of Lc in an Arabidopsis ttg1 mutant background complements phenotypes besides lack of anthocyanins, indicating the involvement of bHLH proteins with similarity to Lc in other aspects of epidermal cell fate [13]. Consistent with this observation, several Lc-like proteins have been shown to affect traits in addition to anthocyanin biosynthesis (Table 1). Lc functions in conjunction with a member of the MYB class of transcription factors to activate anthocyanin expression in maize [14]. This is a common theme in other plant species, in which an Lc-like bHLH protein requires a MYB protein partner to function [6­8,15,16]. In addition, several Lc-like proteins interact directly with the Arabidopsis WD40 repeat protein TTG1 [6­8].

MYB proteins Plant MYB proteins are transcriptional regulators that are characterized by either two (R2 and R3) or three

(R1, R2 and R3) imperfect repeats of the MYB DNAbinding motif [17,18]. Most plant MYB proteins belong to the R2R3 family, and C1 (a regulator of maize anthocyanin production) is the founding member [19]. R2R3 MYB proteins control anthocyanin biosynthesis in species other than maize and MYB proteins have been identified that affect other aspects of epidermal cell fate (Table 1). All show considerable sequence divergence outside of the MYB motif, even those with identical function between species. In spite of this lack of obvious sequence similarity outside of the MYB domains, maize C1 and petunia AN2 (both controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis) are functionally interchangeable [20]. More surprisingly, GL1 and WER [R2R3 MYB proteins involved in specifying different epidermal cell fates in Arabidopsis (root and trichome production, respectively) and exhibiting only 23% sequence identity at their C-termini] are also functionally equivalent when placed under the control of the other's regulatory sequences [21]. Many of these MYBs have been shown to interact with Lc-like bHLH proteins and a WD40 repeat protein [6­8]. In Arabidopsis, proteins containing a single MYB repeat and lacking a transactivation domain have been identified and found to be involved in specifying aspects of epidermal cell fate [22­24]. These proteins interact with TTG1 and an Lc-like bHLH protein, and, owing to the lack of a transcriptional activation domain, form an inactive complex [25,26].

How can a transcription complex with three components control such diverse aspects of epidermal cell fate? The transcription complex composed of a WD40, a bHLH and a MYB protein regulates the expression of multiple distinct target genes in a range of plant species. Insights into how this complex influences epidermal cell identity were provided by studies of Arabidopsis mutants. In Arabidopsis, the WD40 repeat protein TTG1 is central to all aspects of epidermal cell fate, positively regulating trichome formation, anthocyanin production, seed-coat pigmentation and seed-coat mucilage production, and negatively regulating hypocotyl stomatal-cell identity and root-hair formation (perhaps by initiating the differentiation of alternative cell fates) (Table 1; Figure 1) [3,27]. TTG1 provides a scaffold allowing protein­protein interactions between the bHLH and MYB proteins, thus explaining the pleiotropic effect of ttg1 mutations. On the basis of transgenic experiments, it was hypothesized that a bHLH protein with sequence similarity to maize R was involved in epidermal cell fate determination [13]. The cloning of GL3 (from Arabidopsis) and the subsequent identification of the similar genes TT8 and EGL3 verified this [7,8]. Recent work has shown that these proteins all interact with TTG1 and affect overlapping subsets of the cell fate pathways that TTG1 regulates (Figure 1) [6­8]. Association of GL3 with TTG1 regulates

Figure 1. Interactions between WD40, bHLH and MYB transcription factors in Arabidopsis resulting in different epidermal cell types. In Arabidopsis, TTG1 (a WD40 repeat protein) is involved in specifying all epidermal cell types in concert with the bHLH proteins GL3, EGL3 or TT8, which exhibit a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity. In turn, the bHLH proteins interact with either R2R3 MYB repeat proteins (which are highly divergent from one another and specific for individual epidermal cell fates) or single MYB repeat proteins, which are more similar to one another and result in an inactive transcription complex.

trichome, root-hair and anthocyanin production; EGL3 regulates the same three pathways and also that leading to the production of seed-coat mucilage; TT8 interacts with TTG1 to specify only synthesis of anthocyanin, seedcoat mucilage and seed-coat pigmentation [7,8,28]. In turn, the bHLH proteins interact with MYB proteins that exhibit specificity for individual developmental pathways within these subsets (Table 1) [6­8,28]. The combinatorial interaction of these proteins influences epidermal cell identity and it is the R2R3 MYB proteins that ultimately determine which cell fate is adopted. By contrast, the single-repeat MYB proteins TRY, CPC and ETC1, which lack transcriptional activation domains, are partially redundant and might prevent the formation of a functional WD40­bHLH­MYB complex by competing with R2R3 MYB proteins for bHLH proteins [22,24­26]. The requirement for a WD40­bHLH­MYB transcription complex has been established for the control of anthocyanin biosynthesis in other plant species [29]. Heterologous expression of these proteins from other species in Arabidopsis mutant backgrounds has demonstrated their ability to complement mutations that perturb aspects of epidermal cell fate beside anthocyanin biosynthesis. However, this potential to participate in diverse aspects of epidermal cell fate is not always evident in the endogenous system. The petunia protein AN1 is the only such protein, apart from those of Arabidopsis, that has been shown to affect cell fate decisions besides anthocyanin synthesis [29]. The control of other aspects of epidermal cell fate in other plant species might differ from that in Arabidopsis, with only anthocyanin biosynthesis conserved, or there might be as yet unidentified orthologues of the Arabidopsis genes. Evolutionary history of the MYB­bHLH­WD40 activation complex The WD40 repeat proteins form an ancient family that is found in all eukaryote genomes analysed. They have been reported from animals (including bilaterians and the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris), fungi and the slime mould Dictyostelium, as well as from plants [30]. Their ubiquitous nature suggests that they are ancestral to the modern eukaryotes, but they are present in few non-eukaryotic genomes: only in Anabaena, Synechocystis and Thermomonospora (http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/wdrepeat/). The absence of WD40 repeat proteins from E. coli and other bacterial genomes, as well as from archaeal genomes, suggests that they were acquired by an ancestral eukaryote from a cyanobacterial relative (such as the a-proteobacteria, proposed ancestors of mitochondria [31]). In all proteins studied, WD domains act as sites for interactions with other proteins, but the range of proteins with which they interact is large and varies between kingdoms. Many animal genomes have experienced more extensive duplications of the family than seen in plant genomes, adding to the diversity of their roles [30]. The bHLH proteins are probably descended from prokaryotic transcription factors containing a helix­ loop­helix structure. In eukaryotes, HLH domains are associated with a basic domain at their N-terminal side, which is necessary for DNA recognition and binding.
www.sciencedirect.com

These bHLH proteins evolved early in the eukaryotic lineage [32] and are present in plants, animals and fungi [33]. The bHLH proteins are DNA-binding proteins found in all eukaryotic lineages. Their numbers are limited in animals but their roles are usually essential [32]; in plants, their repeated duplication has generated enormous families, often with overlapping or redundant roles [33]. The MYB gene family is eukaryote specific [34] and has followed divergent evolutionary pathways in plants and animals. In animals, a limited number of duplications of a gene encoding three MYB repeats gave rise to a small gene family; by contrast, in plants, multiple duplications of both a three-repeat MYB and MYB genes encoding only one or two MYB repeats gave rise to an extensive and varied family [35]. Evolutionary debate has centred on whether these divergent evolutionary histories indicate polyphyletic origins of MYB proteins within animal and plant lineages [34,36]. However, the identification of both tworepeat and three-repeat MYB proteins in the ciliate Sterkiella histriomuscorum suggests strongly that the evolutionary origins of the MYB family lie in the unicellular eukaryotes [37]. In all systems analysed, MYB proteins are DNA binding and might activate or repress transcription through interactions of their C-terminal regions with other components of the eukaryotic transcriptional machinery [38]. In animal systems, there are no data indicating that animal MYB and bHLH proteins act together with a WD40 repeat protein, but vertebrate c-Myc has been shown to have a possible c-Myb-activating function [39]. The complex as it forms in plants controls epidermal phenotype in several higher plants, and can thus be estimated to be at least 120 million years old. Recruitment of the complex within the land plant lineage Because the components of the MYB­bHLH­WD40 complex were present in the ancestors of all plants and because modern angiosperms use the whole complex, we must search for its first usage as a complex in older plant lineages. There is currently little known about the roles of these proteins in any plant more basal than the gymnosperms, but a potential member of the complex (PpMYB1) has been described in the moss Physcomitrella patens [40]. PpMYB1 shows sequence similarity to AmMIXTA, which modifies the activity of a bHLH protein in a heterologous host (B. Glover and C. Martin, unpublished). Further work in this system should elucidate the early role of the complex in land plants. Evidence that it could be functional in the gymnosperm lineage has emerged recently from work focusing on the MYB component. A gene was isolated from Picea mariana (black spruce) that shows sequence similarity to maize C1. In concert with the maize R gene (encoding a bHLH protein), this new sequence was sufficient to induce activity of the promoter of the maize Bronze2 gene (which encodes an enzyme in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway) in cell cultures [41]. The demonstration that a gymnosperm MYB protein can substitute for a maize MYB protein in the maize complex suggests strongly that the protein complex is active in gymnosperms. Further work in this system should

clarify the sequences and functions of the bHLH and WD40 components. Once adopted by land plants, the MYB­bHLH­WD40 complex was recruited to control the diversity of epidermal cell development. This single regulatory complex has been used so extensively by plants because of its simplicity, flexibility and plasticity. It is a clear example of evolutionary and genetic thriftiness, with an established network of tried and tested regulatory motifs being co-opted to produce new phenotypic traits by variation of the bHLH or, more usually, the MYB component. Regulatory genes and their own regulatory sequences, as well as their target DNA-binding sequences, are able to evolve more rapidly than the structural genes they control [42]. DNA-binding sequences have even greater flexibility than coding regions because cis regulatory sequences are modular, allowing each module to act and evolve independently. This results in greater heterozygosity (and hence variability) in the regulatory sequences than there is in the coding sequences [42]. The combination of the flexibility inherent in the MYB­bHLH­WD40 complex and the variability of the regulatory DNA to which it binds has resulted in a system so flexible that it is responsible for generating most of the diversity of plant epidermal cells. The flexibility of this complex, and particularly the MYB component, will allow continued modification in response to changing pressures on epidermal cell development in the future. Indeed, recent evidence has emerged that the MYB component of the complex is still evolving in maize, in which a new allele has been described from a maize line indigenous to the Bolivian highlands [43]. The pl-bol3 allele contains three copies of the pl1 gene with different regulatory regions. The proteins encoded by this allele interact with a unique set of bHLH proteins and result in a novel pattern of anthocyanin deposition, which could provide a selective advantage by protecting underground organs from predation and limiting damage from ultraviolet light [43]. Constraints on the evolution of the system The structural integrity of the individual protein components of the MYB­bHLH­WD40 complex is determined by interactions that occur between their constitutive amino acids. This restricts the amino acid changes that can occur. In particular, maintenance of the seven-bladed b-propeller structure of the WD40 repeat protein places exquisite constraints on the extent to which this protein can evolve [1]. The requirement to interact with other protein components for functional activity places additional limitations on the evolution of all components of the MYB­bHLH­WD40 protein complex. Recent yeast-twohybrid analyses [6­8] have demonstrated that the bHLH component interacts with both the WD40 repeat and the MYB components of the complex, and can also homodimerize or heterodimerize with related bHLH proteins. These multiple protein­protein interactions impose constraints on the variability of the bHLH because mutation of the domains involved in these interactions could affect the structure and function of the whole complex. By contrast, the MYB protein only interacts with the bHLH partner, partially explaining why the bHLH has been less

free to evolve than the MYB partner. Finally, the regions of both bHLH and MYB proteins responsible for DNA binding must remain highly conserved to achieve sequence specificity, limiting the extent to which variation is possible. Conclusions The recruitment of a MYB protein, a bHLH protein and a WD40 repeat protein into a single complex appears to have occurred only in the plant lineage. Following duplication and mutation of the genes encoding the different components of this complex, particularly the MYB component, the whole complex acquired the flexibility to specify multiple cell fates, providing the developmental machinery necessary to generate the diversity of cell types present in the plant epidermis. Our understanding of the function of this complex in Arabidopsis is now almost complete and we can trace the evolutionary history of its individual components back to ancestral unicellular eukaryotes. A fuller understanding of the evolution of plant epidermal cell diversity requires us to link duplications of MYB-, bHLH- and WD40-encoding genes with the appearance of particular cell types in the fossil record. Similar work with the genes encoding MADS box proteins has produced a picture of morphological evolution tied to the duplication and diversification of particular genes in the family [44]. To paint a similar picture explaining the evolution of cellular diversity within the angiosperms will require future work to focus on the isolation and functional characterization of members of the MYB­bHLH­WD40 complex in more ancestral plant groups, and, in particular, on the interactions of members of the complex with one another. It is likely that many more genes encoding MYB proteins will be identified than genes encoding bHLH and WD40 proteins, and one challenge will be to identify the subset of these that operate in a bHLH- and WD40containing protein complex. Once the members of these complexes have been isolated and their interactions defined, it should be possible to detect co-evolution by analysing sequence evolution at the sites of interaction. Given the importance of flexible development and a multifunctional epidermis to the success of the angiosperms, this work will be important in explaining a major part of the molecular evolution that gave rise to their great diversity.

Five things you might not know about Elsevier
1. Elsevier is a founder member of the WHO's HINARI and AGORA initiatives, which enable the world's poorest countries to gain free access to scientific literature. More than 1000 journals, including the Trends and Current Opinion collections, will be available for free or at significantly reduced prices. 2. The online archive of Elsevier's premier Cell Press journal collection will become freely available from January 2005. Free access to the recent archive, including Cell, Neuron, Immunity and Current Biology, will be available on both ScienceDirect and the Cell Press journal sites 12 months after articles are first published. 3. Have you contributed to an Elsevier journal, book or series? Did you know that all our authors are entitled to a 30% discount on books and stand-alone CDs when ordered directly from us? For more information, call our sales offices: +1 800 782 4927 (US) or +1 800 460 3110 (Canada, South & Central America) or +44 1865 474 010 (rest of the world) 4. Elsevier has a long tradition of liberal copyright policies and for many years has permitted both the posting of preprints on public servers and the posting of final papers on internal servers. Now, Elsevier has extended its author posting policy to allow authors to freely post the final text version of their papers on both their personal websites and institutional repositories or websites. 5. The Elsevier Foundation is a knowledge-centered foundation making grants and contributions throughout the world. A reflection of our culturally rich global organization, the Foundation has funded, for example, the setting up of a video library to educate for children in Philadelphia, provided storybooks to children in Cape Town, sponsored the creation of the Stanley L. Robbins Visiting Professorship at Brigham and Women's Hospital and given funding to the 3rd International Conference on Children's Health and the Environment.
