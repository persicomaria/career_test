ABSTRACT: Peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA) reverses oxidative damage to both free methionine and methionine within proteins. As such, it helps protect the host organism against stochastic damage that can contribute to cell death. The structure of bovine MsrA has been determined in two different modifications, both of which provide different insights into the biology of the protein. There are three cysteine residues located in the vicinity of the active site. Conformational changes in a glycine-rich C-terminal tail appear to allow all three thiols to come together and to participate in catalysis. The structures support a unique, thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism that relies upon an essential cysteine as a nucleophile and additional conserved residues that interact with the oxygen atom of the sulfoxide moiety.

Biological aging is thought to be a consequence of numerous factors, some under genetic control and others more stochastic in nature, particularly random cell damage via reactive oxygen species generated from normal and pathological processes (1, 2). The oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide, Met(O),1 has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, emphysema, cataractogenesis, and rheumatoid arthritis (reviewed in refs 1-4). At the same time, the readily oxidizable nature of surface methionines suggests that these may act as an endogenous oxidant defense system (5). Other studies indicate that Met oxidation and/or reduction is involved in regulating potassium channel function and other cellular signaling mechanisms (3, 6, 7). The reduction of Met(O) to Met, both as the free amino acid and when incorporated into proteins, is mediated by peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA, EC 1.8.4.6). This enzyme is a member of the minimal gene set required for life (8) and is found in all mammalian tissues, with the highest levels in the cerebellum and kidney (9, 10). The

sequences of the presumed catalytic domains of the MsrAs are highly conserved [e.g., human, Escherichia coli, and yeast MsrAs are 88, 60, and 34% identical to bovine MsrA (bMsrA), respectively] (11, 12). MsrA has the ability to provide protection against oxidative stress in vivo (13, 14). It also appears to be involved in the attachment of pathogenic microorganisms to eukaryotic and plant cells (15-17) and in the onset of Alzheimer's disease (18). The reduction of Met(O) and other small aliphatic sulfoxides by MsrA is stereospecific and is independent of protein-bound metals or cofactors (11, 12, 19, 20). The requirement for a Cys-mediated electron donor (i.e., dithiothreitol in vitro or a thioredoxin-regeneration system in vivo), however, suggested the involvement of one or more Cys residues in catalysis (11, 21). MsrAs contain within their presumed active sites a conserved Gly-Cys-Phe-Trp-Gly motif (12, 19). Mutation of the Cys residue in either bovine or yeast MsrA results in a complete loss of activity (12, 19). Catalysis is presumed to occur through a series of thioldisulfide exchange steps (12), although an alternative mechanism utilizing a sulfenic acid intermediate has been proposed (19). In this report, we present the structures of two modifications of bMsrA. The first structure is a complex with DTT and was determined to 1.6 Å resolution by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) (Table 1). The second modification includes an additional 10 residues at the C-terminus and was determined by molecular replacement to 1.7 Å resolution (Table 1). Taken together, the two structures identify the catalytic residues, suggest a plausible mechanism of action, and illustrate the presumed modes of interaction of the enzyme with both DTT and thioredoxin.

FIGURE 1: Topological features of MsrA. (A) Overall fold of the CT-1 form of bMsrA in complex with DTT (orange carbon atoms) generated with RIBBONS (30). The R-helices (magenta) and -strands (light blue) are numbered consecutively on the basis of the primary sequence. The 3-10-helices are colored green. Atom colors are as follows: nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red; and sulfur, yellow. (B) MADphased, experimental electron density map contoured at 1 surrounding the signature Gly71-Cys-Phe-Trp-Gly75 motif (green carbon atoms) and the covalent DTT complex in the active site. (C) Molecular interactions between enzyme, solvent, and DTT. Five secondary structure elements (R1, R2, 3, 5, and one 3-10-helix) contribute conserved residues that interact (indicated by dashed, cyan bonds) with DTT via solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds (Tyr103, Glu115, and Tyr155), a disulfide bond to the catalytically essential Cys72, and hydrophobic interactions (Phe73 and Trp74). Cys218, located in the glycine-rich C-terminal tail, also formed a disulfide linkage with the opposite end of the DTT molecule. (D) The extended glycine-rich, C-terminal tail of the CT-2 crystal structure is shown in blue and cyan extending from the top right to the bottom left. The much shorter C-terminus of the CT-1 structure, which ends at residue 219, is shown in green with the DTT adduct in yellow and orange. The overall structures of CT-1 and CT-2 are very similar with root-mean-square discrepancy between R-carbon atoms of 0.62 Å (residues 30-218). The secondary structure elements that are shown are for CT-1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The mass spectrometric analysis of bMsrA fragments produced by chymotrypsin treatment led to the identification of two different truncation variants of bMsrA that would crystallize, CT-1 (residues 21-219) and CT-2 (residues 13229). The two variants were obtained by the addition of stop codons to the 3-end of the original E. coli overexpression construct [residues 1-233 (12)] and the removal of the N-terminal His tag by varying degrees of digestion with chymotrypsin. Crystals of CT-1 containing seleno-Met (22) were obtained by the vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of protein [12 mg/mL, 30 mM DTT, 16 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 16 mM NaCl, 0.08 mM EDTA, and 6% DMSO] and well solution [100 mM citrate/Na2HPO4 (pH 4.75) 26-31% PEG 8000] at room temperature. Crystals of CT-2 without seleno-

Met were grown in a similar manner at 4 °C with 5% 1,4butanediol instead of DMSO in the protein buffer and the addition of 100 mM NaCl to the well solution (21-25% PEG 8000). CT-1 crystals exhibited C2 symmetry (a ) 45.8 Å, b ) 76.9 Å, c ) 56.8 Å, ) 109.2°, one molecule/ asymmetric unit), while those of the CT-2 were of space group P21 (a ) 53.7 Å, b ) 66.2 Å, c ) 62.1 Å, ) 91.0°, two molecules/asymmetric unit). Data for crystals cryoprotected in paratone were collected at 100 K with the CCD detector on beamline 9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Data were merged and scaled (Table 1) using DENZO and SCALEPACK (23). Three of four potential selenium sites were identified by SOLVE (24). MAD phases were refined using SHARP (25) and improved by solvent flattening with SOLOMON (26). The experimental electron density for residues 27218 (Figure 1B) was readily traceable despite weak density

for Gly216 and Tyr217. The model was built using O (27) and refined with TNT (28). The structure of the CT-2 variant was determined by using residues 27-206 of the CT-1 model as the search model in AMORE (29). Careful rebuilding of the model revealed residues 29-228, though the density for residues 29-43 was significantly weaker than in the CT-1 structure. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION MsrA Architecture. The structure of bMsrA is of the mixed R/ type, with secondary structure elements in the sequence 1, R1, 2, R2, 3, R3, 4, 5, 6, R4, 7, 8, and R5 (Figure 1A). A search with DALI (31) showed that the core region ( 1, R1, 2, 3, and R3) has topology corresponding to the two-layer sandwich, R- plaits motif. For example, 109 R-carbon atoms can be superimposed on a subdomain of formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (32) with rootmean-square agreement of 4.0 Å. The level of sequence identity is low (13%), however, not indicative of divergent evolution. This core of bMsrA is elaborated by extending the antiparallel -sheet to a six-stranded, mixed -sheet. The "Gly71-Cys-Phe-Trp-Gly75" motif (Figure 1B), which defines the location of the presumed active site, is at the apex of R1 and 1 (Figure 1A). In addition, R2 and a small, two-stranded sheet ( 4 and 5) contribute residues to this region. In the first crystal modification (CT-1, Table 1), the electron density (Figure 1B) displayed the fortuitous trapping of a covalent DTT complex with Cys72 and Cys218. The S atom of Cys72 is located at the N-terminus of R1 near the helical axis (Figure 1C). A water molecule bridges the DTT molecule and Tyr103, Glu115, and Tyr155. The second modification of the protein, CT-2, includes 10 additional residues (Leu220-Leu229) at the C-terminus. In the context of this extended "tail", and lacking the interaction with DTT, Cys218 adopts a different conformation (Figure 1D). The tail itself, which is glycine-rich, is rather extended and makes limited contacts to the rest of the protein. In this crystal form, a surface loop (residues 163-166) from a symmetry-related molecule also binds near the active site (Figure 2A). This crystal contact is chiefly via water-

mediated hydrogen bonds, although direct interactions were found from the amide nitrogen atom of Ala164 and the side chain of Glu165 to Asp150 and Tyr155, respectively. This contact suggests how the surface-exposed active site could

FIGURE 3: Proposed reaction mechanism for bMsrA. The residues that are shown are thought to provide interactions that facilitate the binding and activation of substrate and the stabilization and breakdown of the covalent intermediate. Breakdown of the intermediate can occur via intra- or intermolecular thiol-disulfide exchange (see the text). For class I MsrAs (see the text), including bMsrA and hMsrA, this process is most likely mediated through Cys residues (Cys218 and Cys227) within a glycine-rich C-terminal tail that shuttles electrons from the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system (TR and TRR, respectively). Class II MsrAs may alternatively utilize either thioredoxin or their own cysteine-containing, C-terminal domains to return the active site to the fully reduced state for another round of catalysis.

freely interact with small peptides and macromolecular protein substrates, as well as its in vivo thio-disulfide exchange partner, thioredoxin. Despite having part of another bMsrA molecule within the active site, the C-terminal tail appears to be unhindered (Figure 2B) and can still access Cys72. PutatiVe Transition State. On the basis of the CT-2 crystal contact and the CT-1-DTT complex, a model of a covalent, trigonal-bipyramidal, reaction intermediate was generated (Figure 2B). The side chain of Ala164 was extended and modified to resemble Met-S-(O). Only minor adjustments to the side chains of Cys72, Tyr103, and the Met(O)164 analogue were needed to establish reasonable interactions with Tyr103, Glu115, and Tyr155. The backbone hydrogen bond to Asp150 was retained, representing a potential binding interaction with the amino nitrogen atom of free Met or the backbone amide linkage of polypeptide substrates. The putative transition-state binding mode provides a rationale for the observed substrate specificity of MsrAs and the effects of mutations on activity. Consistent with its central role, mutation of Cys72 completely inactivates the enzyme (12, 19). The terminal -methyl group of Met(O) binds in a shallow pocket generated by Phe73 and Trp74 (Figure 2B). Consistent with the known specificity of the enzyme, the

bulky nature of these side chains precludes the binding of substrates larger than methionine (11). The mutation of these residues also leads to complete inactivation (19). The model for the transition state is compatible with the observation that MsrAs are only able to reduce the S-form of the sulfoxide moiety (19, 20). The possibility that the reaction mechanism may occur through a sulfenic acid intermediate (19) was examined by trying to dock the intermediate so that nucleophilic attack would occur at the oxygen atom of the sulfoxide (33). A plausible orientation was not, however, immediately apparent. Reaction Mechanism. A reaction scheme (Figure 3) was formulated using a combination of the available data and the historical literature on small molecule reactions of thiols with sulfoxides (34-36). The proposed scheme involves the overall transfer of two protons and two electrons and appears to be unique among other known reductases (12, 33, 3739). Cys72 is activated and stabilized as the thiolate anion due to its location at the positive end of the R1 helix dipole (Figure 1C). Studies on thioredoxin and model peptides suggest that this favorable interaction could decrease the thiol pKa from 8.8 by several pH units (40). Attack on the sulfur atom of Met(O) by Cys72 may also be encouraged by simultaneous proton transfer from Glu115. The resulting

Accelerated Publications tetravalent sulfur intermediate is stabilized by interactions with Tyr103, Glu115, and Tyr155 (Figure 2B). A subsequent proton-transfer step and the attack of Cys218 on Cys72 facilitate the loss of water and collapse of the intermediate to the sulfide of methionine. The active site is returned to a fully reduced state by thiol-disulfide exchange via Cys227 and either DTT or a thioredoxin-regeneration system. The structure supports the prior suggestion (12) that three thiols (Cys72, Cys218, and Cys227) participate in catalysis. The first two are directly in the active site, and the third can move closer via movement of the glycine-rich C-terminal tail (Figure 1). Support for the direct involvement of Cys218 and Cys227 in the reaction mechanism comes from the mass spectrometric determination of the free sulfhydryl states of all Cys mutant pairs of bMsrA (12). Only upon treatment with substrate was a disulfide bond formed between either Cys72 and Cys218 or Cys72 and Cys227. The inability of DTT to restore the activity of the Cys218 variants, in contrast to the Cys227 mutants, also suggests that Cys218 is the preferred thiol for the release of product (12). Moreover, the observed increase in enzyme activity with DTT, as compared to thioredoxin for the Cys227 variants, indicates that the role of Cys227 is to facilitate the transfer of electrons from thioredoxin. These observations support the possibility that the C-terminal tail can flip in and out of the active site (Figures 1D and 2B). It is also clear that if, for example, Cys218 is removed, a thiol group in the vicinity can compensate and restore activity. This thiol can be either from the protein, i.e., Cys227, or from an exogenous source, i.e., DTT or thioredoxin. C-Termini Comparisons. A comparison of 20 putative and known MsrA domains shows that there is some diversity in the location and number of Cys residues at the C-termini (12). The observation that the thiol needed for the release of the product can come from a variety of intra- and intermolecular sources may account for the variation seen in this region. Nonetheless, these differences raise the question of whether the role for the C-terminal tail in the reaction mechanism proposed for bMsrA is applicable to the entire family. Closer inspection of the alignment suggests that bMsrA and hMsrA belong to a subclass of MsrAs characterized by a glycine-rich, C-terminal tail that contains one or two Cys residues. We refer to this subclass as "type I". In contrast, the "type II" MsrAs are characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal extension (17 kDa) of unknown function. Both classes of MsrAs contain a Cys residue at or near Cys218. Those MsrAs that do not contain a Cys227 equivalent most probably rely on thioredoxin for reducing the disulfide bond formed between Cys72 and Cys218. It is tempting to speculate that the C-terminal domain of the type II enzymes, which contains two Cys residues, may modulate activity. Two outliers in this analysis are the MsrAs from Drosophila melanogaster and Bacillus subtilis. The former enzyme is only slightly homologous to either the type I or type II MsrAs at the C-terminus. Interestingly, the B. subtilis enzyme has a Cys residue equivalent to Gly75 in bMsrA. Molecular modeling suggests that this residue could enable catalysis by the formation of a disulfide bond in a manner similar to that of the CysXXCys motif seen in the thioredoxin family (40). Summary. The key players in MsrA catalysis are seen to be Cys72, Phe73, and Trp74 of the Gly-Cys-Phe-Trp-Gly motif,

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 44, 2000 13311 the residues that bind the oxygen atom of the sulfoxide moiety, Tyr103, Glu115, and Tyr155, and possibly the substrate contact residue Asp150. In 19 out of 20 MsrA sequences, all of these residues are conserved, and in the 20th, only Tyr203 and Asp150 are changed. This remarkable conservation emphasizes the importance of Met(O) reduction by MsrA in all organisms. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We gratefully acknowledge the technical assistance of L. S. Gay, M. Wang, D. A.
