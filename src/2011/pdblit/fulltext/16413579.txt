Abstract Oxidative damage to DNA is the seemingly inevitable consequence of cellular metabolism. Furthermore, despite protective mechanisms, cellular levels of damage may increase under conditions of oxidative stress, arising from exposure to a variety of physical or chemical insults. Elevated levels of oxidatively damaged DNA have been measured in numerous diseases, and as a result, it has been hypothesised that such damage plays an integral role in the aetiology of that disease. This review examines the validity of this hypothesis, exploring the mechanisms by which oxidative DNA damage may lead to disease. We conclude that further validation of biomarkers of oxidative DNA damage, along with further elucidation of the role of damage in disease, may allow these biomarkers to become potentially useful clinical tools.

1. Free radicals and oxidative stress Free radicals are defined as any chemical moiety capable of existing with a lone electron in an orbital i.e. an unpaired

electron (denoted as U). It is this facet which makes free radicals more reactive than non-radicals, since orbital pairing of electrons increases stability. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are oxygen containing molecules which may

Cellular consequences: modified DNA (examples of modified DNA bases shown) can give rise alterations in cellular processes ultimately leading to cytotoxicity, cytostasis, or proliferation. Protection: ROS may be intercepted by low molecular weight antioxidants, such as vitamin C and E, or antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (derived from Evans and Cooke, [22]).

be radical, for example, superoxide (O2UÀ) and hydroxyl radical (UOH) or non-radical, for example hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen (1O2; Fig. 1). Normal cellular metabolism appears to be a primary source for endogenous ROS, and whilst normally non-pathogenic, release of ROS from these cellular processes, and their evasion from antioxidant pathways (e.g. glutathione peroxidase, vitamin E), result in the background levels of oxidative modification of cellular molecules, including DNA, which can be detected in normal tissue. However, various external events, such as exposure to ionising or ultraviolet radiation, can lead to an increase in the generation of ROS. The resulting disturbance of the prooxidant/antioxidant balance, in favour of the former, leads to a condition of oxidative stress, with subsequent oxidation of cellular components, activation of cytoplasmic/nuclear signal transduction pathways, modulation of gene and protein expression and alteration of DNA polymerase activity [1]. Deoxyribonucleic acid is a particularly important target for oxidation, as damage may lead to heritable alterations. Consequently, damage to DNA has been well studied, and several classes of product identified: base oxidation and fragmentation products (e.g. single- and double-strand breaks); inter/intra-strand cross-links;

2. Oxidative modification of DNA Not all reactive oxygen species damage DNA directly [2]. For example, H2O2 and O2UÀ may initiate DNA damage by interaction with transition metal ion chelates, in particular iron and copper, in the metal-catalysed Haber­ Weiss reaction, producing UOH. The hydroxyl radical is perhaps the most frequently considered of damaging species, with over twenty different products formed from UOH attack on the bases in DNA. The principal oxidative DNA damage (ODD) products include 8-hydroxyadenine (8-OH-Ade), 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua; and its deoxynucleoside equivalent, 8-OH-dG), 5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymine (thymine glycol, Tg) and ring-opened lesions: 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde) and 2,6diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua; [3,4]). Examples of such lesions are represented in Fig. 1. Reflecting the emphasis of the literature, this review will focus upon 8-OH-Gua although, where appropriate, other lesions will be considered.

Microsatellite instability/loss of heterozygosity

Undefined lesion(s)

The mutational specificity of Tg has been much studied in both bacterial and mammalian cells, with the general agreement that Tg does not have a significant mutagenic potential. Recent studies have suggested that, rather than being mutagenic, Tg blocks replication one nucleotide before and after the lesion [21]. The results of the limited studies investigating the mutagenicity of 5-hydroxy-methyluracil (5-OH-MUra) have largely been conflicting. Whilst not significantly toxic to a cell, the mutagenicity of 5-OHMUra has been implied by the presence of an enzyme for its repair. Initially described as potentially mutagenic in bacteria and mammalian cells, it appears that, rather than inducing point mutations, the presence of 5-OH-MUra leads to large/intermediate deletions in mammalian cells [142]. However, these deletions do not arise as a result of mis-pairing or mis-incorporation, rather it seems as if base excision repair by OH-MUra-DNA glycosylase may lead to the deletions [142]. In normal cells, the length of repetitive sequences of DNA, so-called microsatellites, is constant, however the length of these repeats can be variable in tumour cells. This microsatellite instability (MI) derives from DNA damage, and has been linked to a number of sporadic cancers. The association between oxidative events and MI appears to be increasing, with oxidative DNA damage shown to increase the frequency of microsatellite instability through induction of mutations in the repeat sequences [143], and discontinuous LOH being described as a signature mutational pattern of oxidative DNA damage [144].

Epigenetic effects of oxidative DNA damage Cell signalling ROS are themselves intra-cellular signalling molecules, although whether sufficient levels of ROS can be induced by an oxidative insult, such that gene expression is affected, appears doubtful [145]. However, single strand breaks, for example generated by 2 Gy of ionising radiation, would be present in orders of magnitude greater than endogenous levels and hence a more suitable candidate lesion for signalling [145]. Effect upon transcriptional Ghosh and Mitchell [146] demonstrated that the presence of 8-OH-dG in promoter elements can affect transcription factor control binding. It appears that a single 8-OH-dG moiety in the AP-1 transcription factor binding site in the promoter region of genes can completely prevent transcription factor binding and hence the level of transcription. Being GC-rich, these regions represent a considerable target for ROS. Further support for such a mechanism derives from the substitution of dG for 8-OH-dG in the cognate DNA sequence of the transcription factor SP1 [147]. This effect may have pathological consequences, as the interference of Sp1 and NF-nB binding in the kidney and liver of diabetic rats was postulated to be due to ROS-mediated damage to DNA.

3. Repair of oxidatively modified DNA The consequences of a failure to protect or repair the genome would appear to be manifold and include: the induction of mutations, microsatellite instability, loss of heterozygosity, chromosomal aberrations, altered gene expression (Table 1), and eventually cytostasis (arrest of cellular growth and multiplication), cytotoxicity, or neoplastic growth (Fig. 1). Consequently, oxidative damage to nucleic acid has been associated with a number of pathologies including neoplastic, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. Of all the modified bases, the processes which repair 8OH-Gua are perhaps best understood, and may be regarded as a template for the processes which repair other lesions. To combat the deleterious biological effect of the presence of 8OH-Gua, cells have developed specific mechanisms to remove this lesion from cellular DNA. In mammalian cells, three enzymes form the equivalent of the bacterial ``GO'' system. The first level of this protection is human Mut T homologue (hMTH1) which hydrolyses 8-OH-dGTP (a potential substrate for DNA polymerase), thereby eliminating it from the nucleotide pool. The second level of defence is specific glycosylases that initiate base excision repair (BER). Finally human Mut Y homologue (hMYH) which removes adenine that is mis-paired with 8-OH-Gua. Most recently, we proposed that nucleotide excision repair (NER), which involves the removal of a lesion-containing oligonucleotide, may compliment the ``GO'' system [5], based upon evidence that ODD may be repaired by this route [6­ 8].

3.1. Base excision repair The prevailing understanding is that quantitatively, BER is by far the most important route for the removal of the majority of oxidative lesions. At its simplest, this process involves a specific enzyme, with a defined repertoire of substrate, removing the modified base, leaving an apurinic ­ apyrimidinic (AP) site. The subsequent fate of this AP site is proposed to be dependent upon whether the glycosylase also possesses an AP lyase activity, and may involve simply the removal of one nucleotide (short patch repair), or 2­ 6 nucleotides (long patch repair; [9], followed by gap filling and ligation. The glycosylase, considered to have the primary responsibility for the removal of 8-OH-Gua in human cells, is the human 8-OH-Gua glycosylase (hOGG1; [10,11]. This enzyme acts via short patch repair, and has a specificity for 8-OH-Gua:C pairs present in doublestranded DNA (Fig. 2). Characterisation studies of hOGG1 have revealed two isoforms, designated a- and h-hOGG1, which exhibit specificity for sub-cellular localisation to the nucleus and mitochondrial inner membrane, respectively [12,13]. To assess the involvement of OGG1, and possibly other DNA repair pathways in the removal of 8-OH-Gua, urinary of 8-OH-Gua levels was determined in OGG1 deficient mice and compared to wild type [14]. If the OGG1 is the only glycosylase whose activity generates 8-OH-Gua, then urinary lesion levels should be abolished in OGG1 À/À mice. On the other hand, if there are efficient back up glyco-

sylase(s) no change in urinary excretion of the modified base should be observed between OGG1 defective and wild type strains (assuming that this repair process is the main source of 8-OH-Gua in urine). The results obtained demonstrated an approximately 26% reduction in urinary 8-OH-Gua in the OGG1 À/À mice, compared to wild type [14]. This observation seems to indicate that although mouse OGG1 has an important contribution to the generation of urinary 8-OH-Gua, an alternative pathway, not dependent on this enzyme, also generates the modified base. As urinary 8-OH-Gua levels decrease by only 26%, it would appear that this back up pathway, although less effective than OGG1, can compensate, to a reasonable degree, for the lack of OGG1. However, since no significant increases in background level of 8-OH-Gua in cellular DNA of OGG1 À/À mice are observed, these data combined indicate the existence of a back up pathway which limits the level of 8-OH-Gua in cellular DNA and does not involve the release of 8-OHGua. This mechanism might partially replace OGG1 activity in the knockout strain, and may include the recently described NIR mechanism, although there is no direct experimental evidence that this pathway is involved in 8OH-Gua removal [15]. Base excision repair is complimented by at least two other processes, mis-match repair, involving hMYH, and prevention of mis-incorporation, involving hMTH1. 3.2. Mis-match repair and prevention of incorporation Another glycosylase, hMYH, removes adenine mispaired opposite 8-OH-Gua. This mis-pair may arise either from mis-incorporation of 8-OH-dGTP opposite adenine in the template strand, or mis-incorporation of dATP opposite unrepaired 8-OH-Gua in the template strand. The removal of mis-incorporated A, by hMYH, allows a more likely replacement by C, offering hOGG1 a further chance to repair the lesion. Conversely, removal of a mis-incorporated 8-OH-Gua, opposite A in the template strand, can be accomplished by OGG2, a glycosylase whose activity is directed towards the nascent strand. This strand specificity is important as removal of A in the template strand, by hMYH, would actually increase mutation. In contrast, hMTH1 acts at an earlier stage to inhibit erroneous incorporation of 8-OH-Gua into DNA by degrading 8-OH-dGTP to 8-OH-dGMP and pyrophosphate. It is postulated that 8-OH-dGMP is then somehow ultimately degraded to 8-OH-dG, for excretion [16] (Fig. 2). We first proposed this route as one means of producing 8-OH-dG in matrices such as urine, as a product related to DNA repair. However, there is very little evidence that 8OH-dG is a direct product of DNA repair itself, i.e. released as the deoxynucleoside, rather than the base, from DNA, with only one report alluding, indirectly, to its formation as a product of repair [17]. Very recently, the discovery of two new DNA-glycosylases, one of which, Nei-like glycosylase

1 preferentially removes 8-OH-Gua from mispairs with G and A would indicate yet another route whereby misincorporated lesion is removed from DNA in a transcriptionor replication-coupled repair pathway [18]. The repair of oxidatively damaged DNA is considered in much greater detail in Evans et al. [19]. The numerous, highly redundant processes to ensure oxidative damage to DNA does not persist imply or support the importance of this type of damage in the dysregulation of normal cellular process. Impaired or defective repair may lead to increased levels of damage, as might lowered antioxidant capacity, with detrimental consequences for the cell.

4. Effects of oxidative DNA damage upon the cell The presence of oxidised base lesions in DNA is well established, and the number of lesions identified is growing. Of these, there is a significant number whose effects upon replication and transcription have been described. A number of factors influence the effect a particular lesion has upon replication and transcription. Not surprisingly, 8-OH-dG is by far the most frequently studied, and herein is often used as the primary example of how oxidative lesions may exert their effect. Many oxidative base lesions are mutagenic, irrespective of whether they are formed in situ, or arise by misincorporation from the deoxynucleotide pool. For the most part, 8-OH-dG formed in situ results in G Y T substitutions, alternatively 8-OH-dGTP may be mis-incorporated opposite dA, producing an A Y C substitution [20]. Overall it seems that oxidative DNA lesions are best described as weakly mutagenic, for example, 8-OH-dG has mutation frequencies of 2.5­ 4.8% in mammalian cells, although lesion formation, persistence and accumulation in vivo could give this value greater significance. Indeed, oxidative events are reported to be largely responsible for spontaneous mutagenesis [21]. However, mutations are not the only effect of oxidative DNA damage, as illustrated in Table 1. These, as yet, understudied aspects of oxidative damage certainly suggest a potential for oxidants to affect gene expression either through ROS generation, or through interfering with transcription factor binding (reviewed in more detail by Evans and Cooke [22]). Such work supports the hypothesis that events at the DNA level, other than mutation, are potentially involved in pathogenesis.

5. Methods for the analysis of oxidatively damaged DNA Increased free radical production and the resulting damage are present in most, if not all, human diseases. The significance of their contribution to pathological processes can vary between conditions, making assays that measure specific free radical activity and damage particularly impor-

tant. In order to show that ODD is important for the disease of study it is necessary to establish the following: (i) ODD is formed at the site of injury (ii) the time course of ODD formation in a particular disease is such that it could play a role in pathogenesis, e.g. it is not formed well after the disease is established, and therefore cannot participate in the pathogenesis (iii) removal of ODD or prevention of formation has beneficial effects (iv) induction of ODD in model systems, at levels found in disease in vivo reproduces most or all of the symptoms of disease. It is therefore crucial to develop analytical methods for assessing ODD, so that the role of ODD in disease can be investigated. 5.1. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) One of the first ROS-induced DNA lesions to be studied was Tg [23]. Frenkel et al. [24] used high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (HPLC-UV) to identify and quantify Tg in g-irradiated DNA. Thymine glycol is a relatively sensitive lesion to formation (resulting from 50% of the thymine/hydroxyl radical interactions), compared to 8-OH-Gua (only 25% of all products of guanine/hydroxyl radical interactions) and yet 8-OH-dG predominates over thymidine glycol in both mouse and human urine [25]. Reasons for this are believed to include the relative instability of the Tg, resulting in its decomposition, site specific hydroxyl radical formation (largely in guanine-rich regions) and selectivity in the occurrence or repair of damage [25]. As a consequence, the sensitivity of the HPLC-UV assay when applied to Tg detection in urine appeared to be a problem [26]. Therefore quantification required radio-labelled thymine and, for example, large doses of radiation to induce detectable levels of Tg [26]. The issue of sensitivity associated with the detection of low levels of oxidative DNA damage such as Tg was overcome by the measurement of 8-OH-Gua in its deoxynucleoside form, 8-OH-dG, in DNA digests; this was achieved by HPLC with electrochemical detection (HPLCEC; [27]). In this procedure DNA is first extracted from cells or tissues and then enzymatically digested to yield free deoxynucleosides which are separated by reversed-phase HPLC; 8-OH-dG is measured sensitively by electrochemical detection, which provides 1000 times the sensitivity of UV detection [25]. In the same HPLC run, native deoxyguanosine can be measured by UV absorbance in order to provide a reference. The methods employed for the analysis of 8OH-dG in DNA have been the subject of much scrutiny, as it appears that this lesion, and possibly others, may be formed during sample workup. An attempt to address this issue was undertaken by the European Standards Committee

on Oxidative DNA Damage (ESCODD). ESCODD evaluation of methods for ODD analysis focussed upon DNA extraction and hydrolysis as the primary sources of artefactual formation of ODD. Improvements to the methods for sample workup has reduced artefact formation, and improved HPLC-EC analysis of ODD. The HPLC-EC method has also been applied to measure 8-OH-dG in urine, employing a pre-purification step, namely, solid phase [28], or immunoaffinity [29], clean-up of the urine or column coupling, which allows only the urine fractions of interest to actually reach the HPLC detector [30]. 5.2. Mass spectrometric methods Methods such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) produce a specific profile of damage effectively allowing characterisation of hydroxyl radical attack according to the range and levels of DNA base products formed [31]. GC-MS methods have been used to quantify 8-OH-Gua as the free base [3,32], and in DNA by providing the ratio between G and 8-OH-Gua [33]. GCMS is a versatile technique, being applied to the detection of 8-OH-Gua in urine and extracted cellular DNA [34]. Fewer groups use GC-MS than HPLC as the equipment is more expensive and technically more demanding making routine use arduous. Generally, the focus of attention has not been on the exact sensitivity of the technique, moreover the ability to determine ``background'' levels in untreated, native DNA, or in the DNA from unstressed cells. It appears that levels of 8-OH-Gua are higher when determined by the GC-MS technique. In freshly isolated cells, baseline values of between 2 and 11 fold higher have been reported by GC-MS when compared to HPLC. Various factors within the procedures may account for these discrepancies, these include: (i) incomplete enzymolysis in the presence of DNA which has been oxidatively modified, and (ii) the balance between incomplete depurination and the formation of artefacts by formic acid hydrolysis of DNA and derivatisation prior to GC-MS. Hamberg and Zhang [33] examined the levels of 8-OHGua in native, commercially obtained calf thymus DNA under a number of derivatisation conditions and compared these values in the literature. They concluded high temperature derivatisation, even in an anoxic environment, leads to a significant increase in 8-OH-Gua, when compared to values obtained by HPLC. This agrees with the findings of Nackerdien et al. [35] that formic acid hydrolysis provides no significant contribution to oxidation of free guanine to 8-OH-Gua. Development, by the authors, of a room temperature derivatisation method reduced background levels to a range in agreement with HPLC (4­ 9 8-OH-Gua/105 dG). Douki et al. [36] showed that adenine, cytosine, thymine and thymidine all may give rise to oxidation products during derivatisation; their solution to this problem was HPLC pre-purification of

the hydrolysates, to remove the precursors of base oxidation, prior to derivatisation. To avoid possible artefact formation during GC-MS analyses, another approach has been proposed involving the liberation of base products from DNA by repair endonucleases (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase and endonuclease III), instead of acid hydrolysis [37]. It was demonstrated that this approach could be applied to the determination of the background level of oxidatively modified DNA bases, and that the level of the damage is comparable to the lowest values obtained by the other methods (such as the comet assay or LC-MS/MS -- see Below), making this a useful technique [37]. GC-MS, with liquid chromatography pre-purification (LC-GC-MS), appears to be an acceptable approach to the analysis of ODD in DNA. Most recently, liquid chromatography with either single, or tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS or LC-MS/MS) has emerged as a method suitable for ODD analysis in both DNA [38 ­ 40] and urine [41]. This approach offers all the benefits of LC-GC-MS (positive identification, accurate quantification and simultaneous measurement of numerous products), without the additional steps of fraction collection and sample derivatisation. Additionally, the spectrum of measurable lesions has increased to include 8-hydroxy-dA, 8,5V-cyclo-dA, and 8,5V cyclo-dG (including stereoisomers of the latter two lesions [38]). 5.3.

P-post-labelling

P-post-labelling procedures provide the potential for detection of a broad range of damage products, such as thymidine glycol [42], and 8-OH-dG [43,44]. However, the techniques are very time-consuming and cumbersome, involving DNA purification, digestion with enzymes, enrichment of the 8-OH-deoxynucleotide, addition of a radio-labelled phosphate group and thin layer chromatography [45]. The time-span for analysis is in the order of days. A method has also been described using the postlabelling principle to attach a fluorescent label to 8-OH-dG which is then quantified using HPLC with a conventional fluorescence detector, avoiding the use of radiolabels [46]. During their evaluation by ESCODD, post-labelling techniques did not appear to be suitable for the analysis of ODD, and few groups currently use this approach. 5.4. Immuno-detection of ODD The potential exists to develop immunoassays to detect ODD, although such assays have been plagued by a lack of specificity, perhaps highlighting the inherent difficulties in raising antibodies to modified DNA. West et al. [47] used a polyclonal antiserum to specifically detect low levels of cis Tg in the DNA of g-irradiated Escherichia coli by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Further to this, monoclonal antibodies have been produced to Tg which allowed sensitive detection

32

of this lesion in g-irradiated and H2O2-treated DNA, by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) [48,49]. Using antibodies raised to 8-OH-Ade, RIAs have also been developed for the measurement of this lesion [50]. Degan et al. [51] produced high affinity, polyclonal antibodies to 8OH-dG, providing an improved urine clean-up method by solid phase extraction, to reduce the complexity of the HPLC-EC chromatogram. This antiserum was also used to quantify the 8-OH-dG in enzymatic hydrolysates of DNA, by competitive RIA, showing excellent correlation with HPLC-EC analysis. Comparable limits of detection for 8OH-dG were also observed with the two techniques (63 fmol RIA; ¨50 fmol HPLC-EC). A similar close comparison was also noted between HPLC and a commercial ELISA kit studying calf thymus DNA, albeit using high levels of 8-OH-dG [52]. Clearly such antibodies represent a simplification of the analysis of urinary 8-OH-dG. This principle was extended by Park et al. [53], using a monoclonal antibody column to enrich for 8-oxo-2V-deoxyguanosine from urine, blood plasma and culture medium. Direct quantification of 8-OH-dG in DNA with a polyclonal antiserum by immunoslot blot has been performed [54], although this necessitated the extraction of DNA from treated cells prior to analysis. Nonetheless, Musarrat and Wani [54] demonstrated the applicability of such immunoassays to the detection of base modifications in very small DNA samples -- nanogram amounts were immobilised. The strength of such techniques relies largely on the amplification step, by which levels of antibody binding are recognised and amplified by an enzyme/substrate process. As reported earlier, extraction of DNA can produce artefactual damage and therefore the development of methods for direct in situ demonstration of oxidative damage to DNA is very desirable. Yarborough et al. [55] reported the successful application of the monoclonal antibody, developed by Yin et al. [56] to the immunocytochemical detection and semi-quantification of 8-OH-dG in aflatoxin B1-treated cells and frozen tissue sections, following denaturation of the DNA. This method possesses the potential for application in numerous studies to assess oxidative damage. Whilst the DNA levels of 8-OH-dG studied by the groups involved in ESCODD are largely below the limit of detection for most ELISAs, their current use appears to be predominantly in the assessment of urinary lesion levels [57]. Whilst there appears to be some disparity between urinary 8-OH-dG levels when measured by chromatographic techniques, compared to ELISA, (thoroughly discussed in Cooke et al. [57], we have noted a correlation between the two approaches, suggesting recognition of a common analyte (8-OH-dG; Cooke et al., unpublished results). The precise cause of the discrepancy is presently subject to intense investigation, and has yet to rule out the use of ELISA [57]. At best, in situ immunocytochemical approaches to lesion detection are semi-quantitative, allowing the identification of gross differences between cells/tissues, but with the clear benefit of indicating

lesion location within the cell/tissue. Finally, antibodies to specific lesions offer the potential for application to the tried-and-tested approach of dipstick methods, facilitating near-patient-testing. 5.5. Comet assay The single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay; since the final appearance of the cells following electrophoresis can be likened to a comet with a nucleus and tail) was developed as a method to examine DNA integrity at a single cell level [58,59]. Because this technique uses small numbers of cells, it has proven useful for the analysis of DNA damage when sample availability is limited, e.g. with small animals or in biomarker studies using pin-prick samples of blood. Initially, the comet assay comprised two main forms, the neutral comet assay, for the analysis of double-strand breaks in DNA, and the alkaline comet assay, for examination of double and single strand breaks, as well as alkali-labile sites (abasic sites remaining after the removal of damaged bases). This basic comet assay format has been expanded since its inception, most notably by the use of DNA glycosylases to examine specific base lesions [60]. The comet assay involves the lysis of cells embedded in an agarose gel on microscope slides; lysis removes cellular protein and lipid to leave a nucleoid (supercoiled DNA stripped of lipid and protein). Subsequent exposure of these nucleoids to high pH unwinds the DNA and under the influence of an electric field, the damaged DNA migrates towards the anode. The movement of DNA into the comet tail is facilitated by DNA strand breaks and relaxation of DNA supercoiling. The comets are visualised using a fluorescent DNA stain and microscopy, the more damaged the DNA (i.e. the greater the number of strand breaks) the longer the comet tails and the greater the DNA content in the tail. Various parameters such as tail length and DNA content are used to score a population of cells to indicate the degree of DNA damage present in the cells. Using the comet assay in conjunction with lesionspecific glycosylases [e.g. FPG protein (excision of 8-OHGua, formamidopyrimidines) or endonuclease III (excision of oxidised pyrimidines, e.g. thymine glycol)] enables the introduction of DNA strand breaks into DNA with an added element of specificity. Increases in comet tail length and DNA content reflect the additional introduction of strand breaks via glycosylase action. This method may be used to compare differences in the levels of base lesions between samples. However, a more exact quantification of the levels of lesions derived from the glycosylase-comet assay, to allow comparison between methods of lesion analysis for example, involves the use of a standard curve comprised of X-irradiated cells and knowledge of the number of breaks introduced into DNA at certain doses of X-rays. This allows calibration of the comet assay and calculation of number of lesions per unmodified base [61].

The comet assay has been compared with other methods during the studies co-ordinated by ESCODD, and generally the comet assay produces the lowest cellular DNA levels of 8-OH-dG [¨0.8 8-OH-Gua per 106 Gua; [61]] compared to the chromatographic methods. Underestimation of the levels of lesion using this assay has been considered a potential confounding factor because of issues surrounding the accessibility of lesions to glycosylases, or the inability to distinguish between closely spaced DNA strand breaks [61]. Despite the various issues concerning absolute quantification of DNA lesions, the comet assay has advantages, particularly in terms of sample size and sample processing and has found use in in vitro mechanistic studies and also human intervention/dietary studies [62 ­ 64]. Related approaches have also been used to address DNA lesion levels in a manner analogous to the comet assay, specifically alkaline elution and alkaline unwinding assays in combination with a pre-digestion with a glycosylase [65,66]. Although technically a little different, in that they do not involve an electrophoresis step, they still rely on the formation of strand breaks to relax DNA/induce fragmentation. A minor disadvantage of these assays is that they require larger samples compared to the comet assay. In all of these glycosylase/strand break induction assays a knowledge of the specificity of the glycosylase is critical for exact interpretation of the data, e.g. FPG protein has a wider specificity than may have been initially anticipated [67].

6. Role of oxidative DNA damage in disease It is clear that, depending upon the lesion in question, one consequence of oxidised base lesions persisting in DNA is mutation. For this reason multiple systems exist to prevent lesion formation, and should damage occur, ensure rapid lesion removal; with the enzyme systems responsible for the latter having much overlap of substrates (see earlier section). DNA mutation is a crucial step in carcinogenesis and elevated levels of oxidative DNA lesions have been noted in many tumours, which have led to the suggestion that such damage is important in the aetiology of cancer. 6.1. Carcinogenesis Oxidative mechanisms have been demonstrated to posses a potential role in the initiation, promotion and malignant conversion (progression) stages of carcinogenesis. Given that cumulative cancer risk increases with the fourth power of age, and is associated with an accumulation of DNA damage, so oxidative DNA damage has been investigated in cancer. Lesions such as 8-OH-dG are established biomarkers of oxidative stress and coupled with their potential mutagenicity in mammalian cells, this has lead to their proposed potential as intermediate markers of a disease

endpoint, for example cancer. Supportive of this proposal are the findings that GC Y TA transversions, potentially derived from 8-OH-dG, have been observed in vivo, in the ras oncogene and the p53 tumour suppressor gene in lung and liver cancer. Of course, GC Y TA transversions are not unique to 8-OH-dG, whereas CC Y TT substitutions, in the absence of UV light i.e. in internal tumours have been identified as signature mutations for ROS [68]. Numerous studies have attempted to establish a relationship between levels of oxidative DNA damage and cancer (Table 2a). Elevated levels of damage are purported to arise as a consequence of (i) an environment in the tumour low in antioxidant enzymes and high in ROS generation [69], or (ii) reduced DNA repair.

6.1.1. Increased ROS generation It has been reported that at least some tumour cell lines can produce significant levels of H2O2, without exogenous stimulation, perhaps accounting for the elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage seen. It appears that the presence of the labile iron pool (LIP) in cells, which comprises low molecular weight iron, together with H2O2 can result in the production of ROS. In the study of Gackowski et al. [70] a significant correlation has been determined between LIP and the endogenous level of 8-OH-dG in human lymphocytes (r = 0.57, p = 0.000066). This in turn highlighted the possibility that under physiological conditions there is availability of a LIP for catalysing Fenton-type reactions in close proximity to cellular DNA. There are also experimental data

40

M.S. Cooke et al. / Clinica Chimica Acta 365 (2006) 30 ­ 49

which demonstrate the existence of a free iron pool in the sera of patients with haemochromotosis [71]. This disease predisposes to cancer, and there are growing epidemiological data to suggest that elevation of the body iron level may increase the risk of cancer [72,73]. Results from the laboratory of Olinski et al. suggest a mechanism that may directly link iron overload and carcinogenesis. Specifically, iron overload may favour the persistence of harmful LIP, which may catalyse the generation of potentially carcinogenic ODD in cellular DNA. As a result of elevated ROS, transcription factors, and their corresponding genes, may be permanently activated which, coupled with increased DNA damage, creates a selection pressure for a malignant phenotype seen in cancer [69]. Whilst such studies have furthered the hypothesis that oxidative DNA damage may be an important risk factor for carcinogenesis, it has been argued that the mere presence of 8-OH-dG in DNA is unlikely to be a necessary and sufficient condition to cause tumour formation. Furthermore there are a large number of pathological conditions in which levels of oxidative DNA damage are elevated, but with no increased incidence of carcinogenesis (Table 2b). This has led us to previously raise a number of issues [19]: (i) Oxidative DNA damage may be an epiphenomenon to an on-going pathophysiological process, and elevated levels do not have a role in carcinogenesis. ^ (ii) FCause or consequence?_ the mere presence of elevated levels of damage in tumours does not indicate that it was oxidative damage which leads to the tumourigenic changes. Elevation in levels may have occurred as a result of well established characteristics of tumours, e.g. increased metabolism or cell turnover. (iii) For DNA mutations to arise from oxidative damage, the nuclei of undifferentiated, proliferating stem cells, must be affected. Given that tissue samples, from both tumours and normal cells, will represent a heterogeneous mixture of differentiated and undifferentiated cells (with the former likely to predominate), current analytical procedures will not quantify lesion levels in the most important Ftarget_ cells. (iv) Not only must the DNA of target cells be affected, but in order to result in a mutation, the damage must be within a coding region of the DNA. It is issues like these that will have to be addressed before the link between oxidative DNA damage and cancer is proven. As with initiation, much of the data which suggest ROS affect tumour promotion have been derived indirectly, that is, chemical promoters can generate oxidative stress, and antioxidants can inhibit promotion, therefore ROS are involved in promotion. It is possible that the antioxidants themselves may allow clonal expansion and tumour promotion by protecting initiated cells from excessive oxidant toxicity and apoptosis that would otherwise kill them. Finally, in linking oxidative stress with promotion it must not be forgotten

that biomolecules, other than DNA, may be oxidatively modified, and that this may also have a significant effect. 6.1.2. Alterations in DNA repair Increased ROS production may lead to an increase in oxidative damage to DNA, but also may decrease the expression/activity of the enzymes which prevent the persistence of such damage. There are numerous experimental data which suggest that decreased activity of the enzymes comprising the ``GO'' system may be linked with cancer development. It has recently been demonstrated that many types of DNA repair pathways are reduced in cancer patients [74]. Whilst the precise cause of the reduced repair capacity of these patients is still unknown, some mechanisms may be suggested: (a) it has been recently documented that lung cancer patients showed loss of heterozygosity at the hOGG1 gene locus [75,76], with patients exhibiting loss of heterozygosity also possessing higher levels of 8-OHdG [76]. (b) It has been suggested that polymorphism in DNA repair genes may be associated with differences in the repair efficiency of DNA damage [77], although this has been disputed more recently [78]. Similarly, whilst some studies suggest involvement of mouse OGG1 (mOGG1) polymorphism in lung cancer development [79], others have cast doubt upon this [80]. Gackowski et al. [81] described a unique study in which all parameters which may represent oxidative DNA base damage, were measured in a cohort of non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC; all of which were smokers) and two control groups. Both control groups were matched for age, but only one matched for smoking status. Besides urinary excretion of 8-OH-Gua and 8-OH-dG, leukocyte levels of 8OH-dG were analysed. The level of 8-OH-dGuo in leukocyte DNA from cancer patients was significantly higher than in either control group (NSCLC vs. smokers p = 0.03 and NSCLC vs. non-smokers p = 0.0001). As the urinary level of oxidative DNA lesions was similar in both cancer patients and the control group with similar smoking status, it appears likely that the higher concentration of 8-OH-dG in lung cancer patients' leukocytes is a result of a DNA repair defect, possibly BER. This proposal was supported by the measurement of 8-OH-Gua glycosylase activity in leukocytes of both smoker groups. Total 8-OH-Gua glycosylase activity was lower in the smoking cancer patients, compared to the disease-free smokers. It has also recently been shown that, whilst 8-OH-Gua accumulates in the DNA of mOGG1 knockout mice [79,82], there are, at present, few reports suggesting an increased risk of carcinogenesis [79]. This may be due to the period of time over which the animals are studied, being insufficient for tumours to develop. To better understand the role of oxidative DNA damage in lung cancer development, three oxidative DNA damage/

repair parameters in NSCLC patients were studied: 8-OHGua level in DNA, 8-OH-Gua excising (glycosylases), and 8-OH-dGTP hydrolysing activities in tumour and surrounding normal lung tissue were compared [83]. Despite 8-OHGua glycosylase activity being lower in tumour than in normal lung tissue ( p = 0.001), tissue levels of 8-OH-Gua level were significantly ( p = 0.001) lower in tumour than in normal lung tissue. In contrast, 8-OH-dGTP hydrolysing activity was higher in tumour than in normal lung tissue, and three orders of magnitude higher than that of glycosylase activity. The results support the suggestion that several different components of the ``GO'' system contribute to the maintenance of 8-OH-Gua levels in human DNA, with the greatest contributor appearing to be the removal of 8-OH-dGTP from the cellular nucleotide pool [83]. Clearly, genetic alterations in repair activity towards oxidative DNA damage have the potential to affect lesion levels, and hence outcome. Whether this is of significance, in terms of predisposition to disease, remains to be established [22]. Taken together, these data suggest that, whilst the role of ^ oxidative stress in carcinogenesis appears well established, the extent to which oxidative DNA damage contributes has not been well defined. Nevertheless, it appears that the DNA damage can be more closely associated with initiation events, rather than promotion, and this may be due to the potential for a multiplicity of mutagenic lesions to be formed, in addition to epigenetic effects, as described earlier. 6.2. Non-cancerous disease (Table 2b) 6.2.1. Brain The neurodegenerative conditions, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, all have oxidative stress implicated in their pathophysiology [84 ­ 87], although equally, there are reports that levels of oxidative DNA damage, specifically, are not elevated [88,89]. However, examination of such apparent discrepancies reveals differences in analytical methods and protocols between studies, any one of which may jeopardise consensus. Furthermore, the tendency not to publish essentially negative results means that principally only reports of elevated lesions are described. Supportive of the studies showing elevated lesion levels are data derived from in vitro studies demonstrating that neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin can generate DNA-damaging, free radical species [90,91]. The role of oxidative stress and oxidative damage ^ to biomolecules other than DNA, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease, and Alzheimer's disease specifically, has been supported in several recent reviews of the subject [92], although the greatest significance for the pathogenesis of the disease has been placed upon lipid and protein oxidation. 6.2.2. Inflammation/infection The association between inflammation and oxidative stress is well documented [93,94], with a number of studies of

inflammatory conditions or infections reporting elevated levels of 8-OH-dG: hepatitis [95]; hepatitis C infection [96] and atopic dermatitis (Table 2b). The inflammatory response can lead to the recruitment of activated leukocytes, which may, in turn, give rise to a ``respiratory burst'' -- an increase uptake of oxygen that causes the release of high quantities of ROS, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, with subsequent DNA damage production. Proof of this proposal comes from the work of Dizdaroglu et al. [97], who demonstrated that exposure to activated leukocytes caused DNA base modifications in human cells typical of those induced by hydroxyl radical attack. In other work, it was shown that exposure of DNA to either activated neutrophils, or activated eosinophils, in media containing metal ion chelators, resulted in 8-OH-Gua formation through a pathway that was blocked by peroxidase inhibitors, hypohalous acid scavengers, and catalytically active catalase and superoxide dismutase [98]. Chronic inflammation and hence oxidative stress have been closely linked to the pathogenesis of such autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis (RA; [99]) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; [100]), with radical production resulting not only in connective tissue damage, but also modified biomolecules being exposed to the systemic circulation, postulated to be the antigen driving autoantibody production [101]. Mechanistically, chronic inflammation can be closely linked to carcinogenesis (reviewed in Weitzman and Gordon [102]), although there is little evidence to suggest that patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, such a systemic lupus erythematosus, have an increased incidence of cancer development [103]. Nevertheless DNA damage does occur in cells cocultured with activated phagocytes [102], with lymphocyte DNA from patients with RA, SLE, vasculitis or Behcet's disease containing elevated levels of 8-OH-dG, furthermore lymphocytes from RA and SLE patients are also more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of hydrogen peroxide [99]. Such damage may fulfil initiation, furthermore tumour promotors have been reported to recruit inflammatory cells which, with their potential to generate ROS, may provide the appropriate stimuli to lead to promotion [104]. It has been estimated that chronic inflammation may be involved in the development of about one-third of all cancer cases worldwide [105,106]. Specific examples are given below: 6.2.2.1. Ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an example of a chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased risk of colon cancer development. The colonic mucosa of patients with UC show symptoms of continuous inflammation, increased ROS production and decreased antioxidant defense [107]. Oxidative DNA damage in the mucosa of patients with UC was shown to accumulate with the duration of the disease, with highest levels in the most dysplastic lesions [108]. 6.2.2.2. Helicobacter pylori infection. H. pylori infection is the major etiologic factor in gastric carcinogenesis. There is a great deal of experimental data which suggest that bacterial

44

infection-induced, chronic inflammation leads to the production of ROS, with subsequent ODD and consequently to carcinogenesis. Increased oxidative DNA damage was detected in gastric tissues during early stages of H. pylori infection [109]. 6.2.2.3. Hepatitis. Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The core protein of HCV has been shown to induce hepatocellular carcinoma in transgenic mice and this protein may play a significant role in the development of HCC in humans. [110]. One of the possibilities that can explain this phenomenon is the induction of oxidative stress via the core protein. It was demonstrated that a consequence of the core protein expression was an age-dependent increase in oxidative stress in the livers of the transgenic mice. This oxidative stress was independent of inflammation and may be directly involved in the development of HCC. Interestingly it was demonstrated that HCV core protein may not only induce ROS production in hepatocytes, but can accelerate ROS production when stimulated by such HCC-associated factors as alcohol, or inflammation [110]. Persistent HCV or HBV infection can lead to an accumulation of 8-OH-dG in human liver cells [95]. It is worth noting that infection is associated with increased cellular proliferation, which may lead to the fixation of 8-OHdG into mutation, linking damage to HCC development. 6.2.2.4. Human immunodeficiency virus infection. Cells infected with HIV produce significant quantities of O2UÀ [111] which, combined with a deficiency in key antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) and a decreased concentration of the antioxidant vitamins, may lead to severe oxidative stress in HIV-infected patients. As may be expected, the level of oxidatively modified bases in the DNA samples isolated from lymphocytes of the asymptomatic HIV-infected patients is significantly increased, compared to the healthy subjects. Moreover, it was demonstrated that antioxidant vitamin supplementation could reduce this level of oxidative damage to DNA [112]. The authors concluded that, although there is no doubt that HIV causes AIDS, oxidative DNA damage may lead to apoptotic cell death in HIV infected patients and might influence the progression of AIDS [112]. 6.2.3. Cardiovascular disease Atherosclerosis may also be viewed as a chronic inflammatory disease, with growing evidence for the involvement of ROS in atherosclerotic plaque development [113­ 117], and a role for DNA damage in this lesion has been proposed [116,117]. Whilst there are relatively few reports examining levels of oxidative DNA damage in cardiovascular disease, one of the most striking results was that reported by Collins et al. [118], which reported a strong association (r = 0.95, p < 0.01) between premature coronary heart disease in men and lymphoctye 8-OH-dG levels in a mixed European population. It has also been demonstrated

that the blood lymphocyte level of 8-OH-dG is elevated in the atherosclerosis patient group when compared to the control group ( p = 0.009). It is clear that 8-OH-dG in the lymphocytes from patients may not necessarily be directly related to the development of the disease. They may, however, mirror pro-oxidative conditions in tissues, as these cells spend a significant proportion of their lifetime in peripheral tissues. It has been suggested that mutations in cellular DNA play a role in the etiology of both atherosclerotic plaque formation and tumourigenesis ([119,120]). The plaques of the arterial wall contain, amongst other components, lymphocytes [113,114]; it is possible that these lymphocytes may be involved in the initiation of atherosclerotic lesion formation [114,121]. It is well established that oxidized LDL may play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions [113,114]. Interestingly, it has recently been found that oxidized LDL (but not unmodified molecule) down regulates enzymes which take part in BER [122]. Given the involvement of BER in the removal of 8-OH-Gua from cellular DNA, it is possible that oxidized LDL, acting via suppression of DNA repair, may contribute to the high level of 8-OH-dG observed in blood lymphocytes. Moreover, it has also been shown that vitamin C (together with A-tocopherol) prevented this down regulation [122], although enzyme activity was not measured. Similarly, in an animal model of atherosclerosis, increased levels of 8-OH-dG, and repair-associated proteins in macrophage-derived foam cells, both associated with dietinduced hypercholesterolaemia, were shown to be reduced during lowering of dietary lipid [123]. The same group showed a similar result in human plaque-associated cells [124]. Equally, humans with GSTM1 null genotypes are reported to possess higher levels of 8-OH-dG in the smooth muscle cell DNA from atherosclerotic lesions [125]. The above reports are all further evidence for the presence of DNA damage in cardiovascular disease, but largely fail to determine whether or not this is an epiphenomenon. 6.2.4. Transplantation (ischaemia ­ reperfusion injury) Liver transplantation has been shown to significantly increase urinary Tg in rats, and that better viability of the transplanted tissue was associated with higher levels of Tg. Urinary thymidine glycol levels were reported to be elevated in six patients following kidney transplantation ([126]), thought to be due to ischaemia ­reperfusion, or reoxygenation, injury. This is supported in studies by Loft et al. [127] whose work in pigs described substantial oxidative insult to DNA post-transplantation, as indicated by elevated urinary 8-OH-dG. This injury to the transplanted tissue is very important, as it can affect morbidity and mortality following bypass and transplantation surgery, haemorrhagic or septic shock, myocardial infarction and multiple organ failure. During the period of ischaemia, xanthine dehydrogenase is converted to xanthine oxidase which, upon reperfusion, undergoes a ``burst'' of activity. However, rather than transferring electrons to NAD+, electrons are transferred to

oxygen, generating superoxide, with subsequent formation of ODD. Also, there are suggestions that neutrophils are trapped behind any thrombi formed, which are primed to undergo respiratory burst upon reperfusion. 6.2.5. Aging The Ffree radical theory of aging_ described by Harman [128] suggests that aging occurs through the gradual accumulation of free radical damage to biomolecules. The failure of antioxidant defences to scavenge all radical species, evident from the increasing Fbackground_ levels of damage with age, will result in the insidious accumulation of damage and gradual loss of function (comprehensively reviewed in Beckman and Ames [129]). Illustrating this point is the report of an age-related increase in serum 8-OH-dG in apparently disease-free individuals over an age range of 15 ­91 years [130]. Numerous studies have reported the accumulation of 8-OH-dG, and by implication other lesions, with age, both in vivo and in vitro, in nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) DNA [131]. Indeed, damage to mitochondria has received a great deal of interest as lesions or mutation in mtDNA could drastically alter the function of this oxygen radical-producing organelle (reviewed in Bohr and Anson [132]). The accumulation of lesions can, in part, be explained by the discovery that DNA repair activity appears to decline with age, allowing the persistence of damage and a subsequent increase in replication errors, although in the case of 8-OH-dG, the numerous repair processes involved may largely compensate for such a decline and the agerelated decline may only impact upon slowly proliferating tissues with high oxygen metabolism, such as liver [133]. Hamilton et al. [134] noted age-related increases in 8-OHdG in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, derived from a variety of rat organs, and concluded that this is derived from a tissue's increased sensitivity to oxidative damage, rather than decreased repair. To study the possible influence of metabolic rate upon ODD, urinary excretion rates of 8-OHGua, 8-OH-dG and HMUra were analysed in mammalian species that substantially differ in metabolic rate and longevity (mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, pigs and humans). Highly significant, positive correlations between specific metabolic rates of the studied animals and their urinary excretion rates for all analysed DNA modifications were found. However, only 8-OH-Gua significantly, negatively correlated with maximum life span. The urinary levels of all the DNA modifications measured in this study, in mice and humans, account respectively for about 2800 and 28,200 repaired events per average cell, per 24 h. This difference closely corresponds to the difference in reported oxygen consumption between these species (there is 10-fold difference in 8-OH-dG level between humans and mice and 11fold difference in O2 consumption between the species). The authors concluded that the high metabolic rate in mice (or other short-lived animal) may be responsible for increased ODD formation and accumulation, compared to longerlived species [135].

The significance of lesion accumulation could relate to another hypothesis, the somatic mutation theory, which states that an accumulation of DNA mutations, not necessarily derived from ROS, leads to degenerative senescence. However, Holliday [136] suggested that given aging is a multicausal process, DNA damage and mutation, whilst important, was unlikely to be responsible for all the pathophysiological changes seen. Nevertheless, these findings appear consistent with the observation that high metabolic rate equates to shorter maximum life span potential and faster aging. Whilst the experimental evidence is not conclusive, the hypothesis for the involvement of free radicals in aging remains compelling.

7. Potential clinical use of biomarkers of oxidative DNA damage Clearly there are a large number of pathological conditions in which oxidative stress may have a role. At the very least, biomarkers of oxidative DNA damage offer the means by which this stress may be monitored, but they may have the potential to: (i) Act as markers of disease development risk (intermediate biomarkers of a disease endpoint). (ii) Assess efficacy of therapy. In order to determine whether levels of oxidative stress are pathological, reference ranges for DNA damage markers need to be established. These need to be derived from a large population of healthy individuals. ESCODD went some way towards defining an acceptable range of values which can be obtained from a given tissue. Whilst this is useful, it also highlights how much work remains before markers of ODD may be used clinically. For example: 1. Does the range of damage levels alter significantly from one cell type, compared to another? It might be expected that cells with a high oxygen requirement, such as brain cells; or involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as liver cells, may be under greater oxidative stress than lymphocytes. Support for this suggestion derives from a study in which concentrations of 8-OH-dG in cerebrospinal fluid are about 10-fold higher than those reported in plasma [53,137]. This high concentration may be due to a very high production of ROS in central nervous tissue. Since the consumption of oxygen by the brain is about 10-fold higher that in other organs [138,139], these data are compatible with the interpretation that there is a higher production of 8-OH-dGuo in the brain compared with other tissues [140]. 2. Do levels of damage vary between differentiated cells, and undifferentiated, stem cells? Many tissue sampling methods result in a mixed population of both cell types.

3. Surrogate tissues. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are often used as surrogates for tissue elsewhere in the body, but which are less easily obtained. However, in the only study of its kind, it has been shown that there is no correlation between 8-OH-dG level in DNA isolated from lymphocytes and other tissues [141]. 4. As reported by ESCODD, different methods of analysis may generate different reference ranges, for example, levels of ODD measured by the Comet assay are appreciably lower than those measured by HPLC-EC.

8. Conclusions Despite the plethora of diseases in which levels of ODD are elevated, demonstrating a causal link between elevations in ODD and the incidence of disease remains elusive. One route to demonstrating this link has been to use repair gene knockout mice. Whilst experiments with single-gene knockout mice have been rather disappointing, with the mice, thus far, displaying few ill effects, combined gene knockouts, such as hOGG1 and CSB, have been more promising, with elevated tissue levels of 8-OH-dG, although a pathological consequence of this has yet to be reported. In humans, circumstantial evidence comes from diseases with DNA repair defects, such as Xeroderma Pigmentosum, which shows an accumulation of damage and increased frequency of skin cancers and, in certain cases, characteristic neurological degeneration. Despite this, we propose that ODD plays an important role in disease, as there are multiple pathways for its repair, clearly the cell does not want this damage to persist. Indeed, there appears to be no limit to the number of pathological conditions in which elevated ODD has been reported. Of course, the mere presence of damage is not proof of a causative link, although, given the close link between ROS formation and oxidative DNA damage and the importance of DNA damage and mutation in carcinogenesis, it is not a large leap of intuition to link oxidative DNA lesions and cancer. The involvement of ODD in the pathogenesis of other diseases is perhaps more difficult to appreciate. Before the measurement of ODD may be used clinically, methods for its measurement need to be fully validated, along with a better understanding of its exact role in the pathogenesis of disease. With this established, it might be possible to use ODD measurements as a clinical parameter, to more closely monitor treatments, identify at risk populations, and ultimately devise prevention strategies.
