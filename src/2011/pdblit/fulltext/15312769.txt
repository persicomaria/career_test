Abstract We had previously written a random-centroid optimization computer program for genetics (RCG) to optimize protein engineering, which was successfully applied to modify single site of the 16 amino acid residues at the active site of B. stearothermophilys neutral protease for improving thermostability [J. Agric. Food Chem., 46 (1998) 1655]. The same program was applied in this study to double-site mutation of the entire sequence of human cystatin C (HCC) with 120 residues for improving its protease inhibitory activity. The RCG program selected two sites simultaneously and amino acid residues to replace the sites selected in the sequence in order to find the best papain-inhibitory activity and stability of the protease inhibitor. Twenty-three double mutants and twenty-two single mutants were expressed by Pichia pastoris. Of the total 45 mutants, G12W/H86V mutant showed a 5-fold increase in the bioactivity over the recombinant wild-type (WT) cystatin. Also, P13F mutant exhibited a half-life temperature (T1/2) 5.2 jC higher than 68.2 jC of WT in addition to a 56% greater papain inhibitory activity. Mutation for diminishing h-sheet content reduced polymerization of cystatin C, thus improving papain-inhibitory activity. The approach using RCG was able to improve the functional properties of cystatin by least relying on the prior knowledge of its molecular structure. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Improving bioactivity and stability of functional proteins through site-directed mutagenesis is of great interest of researchers in the field of protein engineering who are concerned about applications of proteins to medical and pharmaceutical uses. One approach is to use mutagenesis based on rational design, which is assisted by computational techniques, such as molecular modeling [2]. However, it requires detailed structural information on the target protein. Another strategy uses rational design based on empirical rules on potential stability increase of a protein [3], or prior knowledge gained from evolution of protein isoforms with various stabilities [4]. An alternative approach is random mutagenesis, which employs screening a large number of mutants [5] to identify desirable protein mutants.

Our random-centroid optimization (RCO) [6] uses an algorithm that consists of regulated random search (to avoid uneven distribution of the positions to mutate within search spaces), centroid search (sequential simplex less the worst response), and mapping in each cycle. The cycle is repeated until the best response is obtained and therefore, selection of the new, narrowed search space derived from the maps to be used in the subsequent cycle is most critical in finding the global optimum. This approach, when applied to a variety of mathematical models, has been successful in finding the global optimums mostly within 50 iterations. The RCO has proven to be successful for optimizing broadly both chemical and engineering processes or even biological reactions [6]. Successful application of RCO in complicated multimodal cases relies on (i) regulated random designs to avoid localized designs, (ii) centroid designs to search around the best results found during the preceding random search, and (iii) trend curves in mapping directing toward the global optimum. An example is the effective trend curves pointing toward the global optimum obtained by intentionally ignoring the minimum number of factors other than the factor in

question (Fig. 1). Maps ignoring factors as shown on the right side more clearly demonstrates the area of search to be continued than those at the left-hand side of the figure. It was found that the mapping process is so unique in RCO that it is critical in expediting search for the global optimum, when only minimum knowledge is available on the location of the optimum, which is not unusual in many other optimization techniques.

The RCO program used herein was modified for application to mutagenesis by selecting site and amino acid for substitution to optimize the bioactivity and/or stability of a protein. Amino acids to replace the position selected in sequence were chosen on the scales of hydrophobicity, helix propensity, strand propensity, bulkiness or charge. This program was coined as random-centroid optimization for genetics (RCG) [1]. The first successful application of RCG

was the improvement in thermostability of Bacillus stearothermophilus neutral protease. Thirteen single-site mutants were prepared according to the RCG program within the 16 amino acid residues at the active-site helix (G139­ Y154) of the protease. A variant V143E showed a 6.5 jC higher thermostability and 30% greater proteolytic activity than that of the wild-type (WT) protease [1]. This protease study was conducted based on known information on the molecular structure of the protein. However, the number of proteins with known three-dimensional structures, as determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR, is rather limited especially in food related proteins. An approach for optimizing sequences of recombinant proteins with limited knowledge on the three-dimensional structure, such as RCG, would be of great use for protein engineering. Cystatin C appears to have a general protective function, to prevent connective tissue from destruction by intracellular enzymes leaking from dying cells or being misrouted for secretion from malignant cells [7]. In this paper, we report the result of a new application of RCG to the entire protein sequence with 120 amino acid residues of a cysteine proteinase inhibitor, i.e. human cystatin C (HCC), for improving bioactivity and stability. Four factors are entered: (i) site of mutation in Zone I (positions 1­ 35 including the active site) of the sequence; (ii) the amino acid residue to replace at the site selected in i; (iii) site in Zone II (positions 36 ­120 including two binding sites); and (iv) the residue to replace the site selected in iii. Amino acid scales to be used for selecting residues in steps ii and iv are not necessarily the same. The results may provide the feasibility that RCG improves stability as well as bioactivity of a protein without excessively relying on the prior knowledge of its molecular structure.

the second search cycle, the bulkiness scale was employed as an amino acid index. The reason for this selection was to enhance thermostability [6] after successful improvement in papain inhibitory activity during cycle 1. The RCG program can be downloaded from ftp://ftp. agsci.ubc.ca/foodsci/ and run on Windows. 2.2. Materials Papain, chicken egg white cystatin (CEWC), and other highly purified chemicals used were from Sigma-Aldrich Canada (Oakville, ON). 2.2.1. Microorganisms Escherichia coli TOP10F' and Epicurian coli XL1-Blue were used as routine plasmid amplification and host cell for site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. Pichia pastoris X33 was used as a protein expression host. 2.3. Synthesis of HCC gene A gene encoding HCC was synthesized on the basis of its amino acid sequence and P. pastoris preferred codons [8]. Four oligonucleotides based on the design were synthesized, hybridized, and ligated, including a XhoI site at 5V-end and a XbaI site at the 3V-end. The resulting segment was ligated into P. pastoris expression vector pPICZa-C. The gene thus produced was sequenced on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide protocol in order to confirm that the DNA sequence encodes the amino acid sequence of HCC. 2.4. Mutation, protein expression, and purification HindIII/XbaI fragment including HCC gene was ligated into pUC 19 plasmid vector. The pUC 19 plasmid carrying the HCC gene was employed as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to QuikChange SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Clones carrying the mutated gene were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pPICZa-C carrying WT or its mutant was linearized by DraI and transformed to competent cells of P. pastoris X33 according to Pichia EasyComp Transformation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Zeocin-resistant transformants were selected from YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) agar plate containing 100 Ag/ml zeocin and 1 M sorbitol, and grown in 5 ml of YPD medium for 24 h. Integration of cystatins in all the recombinant genomes of P. pastoris was confirmed by genomic PCR using 5VAOX1 primer paired with 3VAOX1 primer. A single colony of transformants was inoculated into 2 ml of YPD medium and incubated at 30 jC with shaking at 250 rpm. Then, the cells were grown in 60 ml of YPD. After collecting the cells by centrifuging at 1500 Â g, the resultant cell pellet was suspended to 24 ml of BMMY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Operation of RCG Complete procedure of the computer program RCG is shown in our previous work [1,6]. First, four variables, i.e. search spaces in the two zones in the sequence and search spaces on the amino acid scale to be used, were entered. The sites and amino acids for mutation were randomly chosen using the hydrophobicity scale as an amino acid index, and thermostability and bioactivity of the selected mutants were determined. Other scales, i.e. helix propensity, strand propensity, charge and bulkiness, could also be selected if it is more reasonable based on the potential mechanism of the target function. By feedback of empirical functional data for the random search, the sites and amino acids for mutation for the centroid search were computed and the mutation experiments continued. The experimental mutation data thus obtained were then combined and mapped for approximation of the response surfaces for narrowing the search spaces in the subsequent search cycle of the RCG program.

at pH 7.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 Â 10 À 5% biotin, and 0.5% methanol as the sole carbon source). Methanol to a final concentration of 0.5% was added every 24 h to maintain induction. After 2-day induction with methanol, the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 Â g for 10 min, and the supernatant was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow low sub (Amersham ´ Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfe, QU). After loading the column with 100 Al sample in 1 M NaCl, the column was eluted with descending NaCl concentrations to 0.1 M in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and the flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Elution profile was monitored using absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions with papain-inhibitory activity were collected and dialyzed against 0.1 M NaCl ­100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). 2.5. Determination of thermostability and papain-inhibitory activity One hundred microliters of 30­ 50 Ag/ml HCC solution in 0.1 M NaCl ­ 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was taken into a 1.5 ml test tube with lid, and was incubated at the desired temperature (25 ­ 100 jC at an interval of 2.5 jC) for 10 min. Each tube was immediately chilled in ice-cooled water. The sample tube was covered with the lid during the incubation and cooling. Papain-inhibitory activity of the cystatin solutions was measured using a synthetic substrate of papain, Na-Benzoyl-DL-Arg-p-nitroanilide [9]. The inhibitory activity was expressed as the amount of active inhibitor (AI) present in the aliquot taken for assay: AI (Amol)=({% Inhibition/ 100} Â {PA (Ag)/23,400 (Ag/Amol)}), where PA is the amount of papain present in the assay solution. The protein concentration of the solution was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Herkules, CA) using BSA as a standard. The half-life temperature (T1/2) was defined as the inflection point on the papain-inhibitory activity vs. temperature curves. Least-significant-difference (LSD) test of SAS [10] was applied to the papain-inhibitory activity data. 2.6. Circular dichroism spectra

ing and 3% stacking gels containing 1% SDS and 1% hmercaptoethanol. Samples were heated at 100 jC for 5 min in Tris ­ glycine buffer (pH 8.8) containing 1% SDS and 1% h-mercaptoethanol. Electrophoresis was run at a constant current of 10 mA for 3 h in the Tris ­ glycine buffer containing 0.1% SDS. The gel sheet was then stained with 0.025% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. 2.7. Size-exclusion chromatography This chromatography was conducted to detect the potential formation of dimers. The sample was prepared at 0.6 mg protein/ml in 0.1 M NaCl ­ 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The sample filtered through a 0.2 Am syringe filter was applied to FPLC gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.1 M NaCl ­ 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. 2.8. A pilot plant production P. pastoris transformant was expressed using a fed-batch fermentor with a 2-l working volume, Inceltech LH Bioreactor (Valley Instrument Corp., Exton, PA). The culturing conditions were similar to the method of Digan et al. [13] except for pH controlled to 6.0. 2.9. Growth inhibition test of colon adenocarcinoma cells Human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell was employed in this study. Caco-2 cells, 7.5 Â 104, were seeded in minimum essential medium eagle (MEME) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) on a 96-well plate, and incubated at 37 jC for 24 h in a CO2 incubator [14]. Then, the protein sample at a preset concentration was added with MEME medium containing 10% FBS and incubated for 3 days. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay [15]. All of the above measurements was performed in triplicate unless otherwise specified.

3. Results Cystatin solution was prepared at 0.3 mg protein/ml in 0.1 M NaCl ­ 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were taken in triplicate at 200 ­ 250 nm with a J-500A spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) at 25 jC using 1 mm path length quartz cell in a water-jacketed cell holder. The secondary structure was predicted using a neural network after modification of Sreerama and Woody's method [11]. SDS-PAGE was also carried out here to investigate if covalent bond formation occurred during mutation and subsequent separation of cystatin C. The method of Laemmli [12] was followed using 15% acrylamide separatHCC is highly homologous to CEWC in amino acid sequence. Naturally occurring HCC has a high association constant with papain (dissociation constant = 0.005 mM), which is similar to CEWC [16]. However, WT-HCC produced from P. pastoris showed only 14% of the papaininhibitory activity of CEWC. It is unknown if this low activity is associated with dimerization or polymerization during expression, purification, and storage or differences in the sequences per se. Dimerization and polymerization cause complete loss of proteinase-inhibitory activity of HCC [17]. Therefore, HCC overexpressed by P. pastoris

was employed as a model for RCG with the goal of improving bioactivity by stabilizing protein molecule. 3.1. Thermostability and papain-inhibitory activity The best half-life temperature T1/2 and relative papaininhibitory activity of mutants were sought by random and centroid searches (Table 1). In each cycle, centroid search was conducted based on the experimental results of the preceding random search. The T1/2 for WT cystatin was 68.2 jC. In the first cycle, the P6C variant yielded the highest T1/2 of 72.8 jC. Double mutation P6C/Q107L exhibited stability that was comparable to the P6C, suggesting that the alteration of Pro6 to Cys is effective for stabilizing the protein. Nonetheless, the mutations did not significantly ( P>0.05) improve the bioactivity (Table 1); hence, sites for mutation and amino acids for substitution were sought again in the second cycle based on the knowledge obtained in the first cycle, especially by judging from mapping.

The second-cycle search yielded a better performance for protein functions compared to the first-cycle search. The highest stability of 73.4 jC was obtained in the P13F variant, having a 5.2 jC higher T1/2 value and 1.56 times greater bioactivity than that of the WT control. Another successful mutant obtained from this cycle was the R8A mutant, which resulted in not only an improved stability by 4.9 jC but also an increased bioactivity. This 3.2-fold increase in bioactivity represented the maximal activity of all single-site mutants investigated. One-site mutations were more effective in stabilizing protein than the two-sites mutations. On the other hand, double-site mutations affected bioactivity greater than stability. The maximal activity was observed in the G12W/ H86V, which was five times that of WT. Although a significant increase in bioactivity was observed for V10S/ R93G with 4.5 times WT activity, the stability of V10S/ R93G was still unsatisfactory. Consequently, the sequence design using RCG achieved a 5-fold enhancement in bioactivity by two-sites mutation (G12W/H86V) and a 5.2 jC elevation in stability by a one-site mutation.

3.2. Response mapping The thermostability and bioactivity data were mapped using RCG (Fig. 2). The trend lines appearing on the map in the first mutation zone (positions 1 ­ 35) indicated that

residues near the N-terminus and around site 12 are responsible for increasing activity (Fig. 2a). In the second mutation zone (positions 36 ­120), the optimum existed near site 108 that could be another substrate-binding site (Fig. 2b) [18]. In the second mutation zone, trends toward lower a-helix

propensity (Fig. 2c, since it is measured as free energy, the larger this value, the lower the propensity) and lower hstrand propensity (Fig. 2d) were favorable for activity and thermal stability, respectively. The map on bulkiness (Fig. 2e) indicated that lower bulkiness in the first mutation zone is favorable in increasing bioactivity, as demonstrated by the trend lines with negative slopes.

putation [11] over the wavelength range of 205 ­ 225 nm showed that the stabilized mutants changed with a slight (6%) decrease in a-helix from 30% of WT cystatin and a corresponding increase in h-strand structure compared to 29% in WT cystatin. Greenfield [19] stated that application of ANN to CD data between 200 and 240 nm yielded reliable values of a-helix and h-structure with correlation coefficient of 0.95 and mean square error of 0.09. SDS-PAGE shown in the insert of Fig. 3 indicates that there has been no covalent association during mutation, except for spontaneous disulfide linkage formation. Apparent mobility increase of the R8A band should have been due to a dehydration effect at the gel periphery. 3.4. Dimer formation

feasibility of industrial production of mutant cystatins. Fermentation using the 2-l bioreactor attained 200 mg protein/l of culture media of a stabilized mutant according to the calculation based on the inhibitory activity. Because cathepsins B and L are involved in the metastasis of some tumor cells [20], the inhibition of activator production through proteolysis by cystatin C may prevent growth of cancerous cells. We assessed the effect of G12W/ H86V on the growth of human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells. The G12W/H86V mutant at 10 nmol/dm3 significantly ( P < 0.05) inhibited the growth of Caco-2 cells (42% inhibition), while the WT at the same concentration did not show any inhibition (Fig. 5).

4. Discussion Heat-treatment of HCC induces its dimer formation at an early stage, resulting in a complete loss of its activity [17]. Size-exclusion chromatographic profile of the G12W/H86V heated at its T1/2 of 70.3 jC showed that the heating caused a decrease in a peak indicating its monomeric state (retention time of 42.4 min) and a concomitant emergence of a broad shoulder peak ranging from 36 to 46 min (Fig. 4). This result would suggest polymerization including dimer formation during the heat treatment, which is in good agreement with the results of gel electrophoresis from Ekiel and Abrahamson [17]. 3.5. Pilot plant production and potential medical application A larger-scale production and chemopreventive testing of the stabilized mutants were investigated to determine the The RCG program directs the search toward the optimum during iteration of mutations resulting in about five times greater bioactivity and 5.2 jC higher T1/2 value. Selection of hydrophobic scale in the first cycle is reasonable, especially when the function mechanism is unknown, although the importance of hydrophobic interaction in protein functions has been well recognized [21]. Selection of a different scale in the second cycle might expedite finding the optimum, however, it did not appear effective in reaching finally to the best function in this study. Mapping informs us the directions to continue the mutation as well as interprets the molecular mechanisms of HCC by demonstrating most effective amino acid index to rationalize the changes appeared on the maps. The mapping locates an area of active sites in the first mutation zone (Fig. 2a) and

that of substrate-binding sites in the second zone (Fig. 2b). These are in agreement with the report that N-terminal region near Gly11 and a region near Trp106 are important for the tight enzyme-binding property of HCC with papain [22,23]. In addition, it was suggested that amino acid substitutions with lower a-helix propensity (Fig. 2c) and those with lower h-strand propensity (Fig. 2d) were favorable for activity and stability increases in the secondmutation zone, respectively. Increase in h-sheet is related to protein destabilization, which may be caused by an amyloidosis [24]. It is worth noting that a participation of h-sheet propensity in protein stability was shown in a study of mutations at site 113 of Bacillus licheniformis a-amylase, thus revealing a good correlation between h-sheet propensity of amino acids substituted and gain in protein stability [25]. In contrast, secondary-structure prediction from CD spectra, which indicated a slight decrease in ahelix and a increase in h-strand for stabilized cystatin variants. These discrepancies in the trends of helix­ strand relationship between the mapping and the CD data may be due to the fact that the CD data in this study have been taken for the whole HCC molecule, and not for individual zones separately. An exhaustive study of mutations at positions 8 ­10 indicated that substitutions to glycine at these positions increased HCC's thermostability [26]. Our experimental data demonstrated a loss of bioactivity induced by substitution of Leu9 to Phe. Lower bulkiness around the Nterminus may increase molecular stability, resulting in higher bioactivity. Our previous paper [1] concluded that lower bulkiness in the N-terminal region at the active site of neutral proteinase contributed to higher stability. Lowering bulkiness might lead to compact side-chain packing of the proteins, thereby resulting in subsequent increase in stabilities. Mapping of the experimental results is, therefore, useful for acquiring information on the protein structure ­function relationship and stability. This may be true especially for new protein molecules with only limited information on the structure available, including the locations of active and binding sites. It is interesting to note that mutations ruining activity in human cystatin do not exist in the sequence of CEWC, which does not appear to cause the activity-loss during expression in P. pastoris [27]. Lee and Levitte [2] developed a simple prediction method for estimating effects of site-directed mutagenesis in a protein core on stability and bioactivity. They suggested that stability and activity could be improved by increasing side-chain packing interactions in the cores of proteins. Matthews [28] also mentioned that destabilization of T4 lysozyme was caused by a loss of hydrophobic and van der Waals' interactions, which were closely related to bulkiness. However, our experimental result showed opposite effects in that the R8A variant was less bulky than WT but had highly improved stability. The improvement of R8A and other successful mutants was accompanied by

changes in secondary structure, which could not be predicted by molecular modeling, or by other prediction methods. Thus, the positive effects thus obtained, which were unexpected from rational predictions, could be derived from RCG mutation. Whenever factors and mutation sites affecting stability are not identified, RCG could be of great use. Heat-treatment of cystatin generated the appreciable change in chromatographic pattern (Fig. 4). This change may be due to an alteration in apparent molecular size induced by structural changes and/or self-association. A retention time of 40.9 min at which the cystatin variant in a dimeric state could be eluted was within the broad peak, suggesting that the variant forms its dimers. The unique profile of the G12W/H86V heated at 70.3 jC might be characterized by the coexistence of monomeric and dimeric forms. NMR data reported showed that dimerization involved properly folded molecules and proceeded via the reactive site of the enzyme inhibitor [17]. Replacement of the amino acid residues at certain positions in the sequence considerably altered protein stability. Outstanding examples are amyloidoses of human lysozyme I56T [29] and HCC L68Q [30]. However, the background mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still unknown. Although effects of single-site mutation are undeniable, it could be an effect upon certain size of zone in the sequence affecting parts or entire structure of the molecules. Success in large-scale production and in vitro cancer growth inhibition of the stabilized cystatin variant with sufficient bioactivity shows a great potential in the industrial application of the approach used in this study. Genomics has been successful in deciphering milliards of DNA sequences such as the human genome. Through translation, they can be converted to the corresponding amino acid sequences. Despite a difficulty in predicting the functionality directly from sequences alone, RCG may enable finding the best functions by mutating gene sequences under the restricted circumstances with limited structural, mechanical information. Therefore, RCG could be a useful tool in proteomics. In conjunction with genetic glycosylation [31], the pilot plant fermentation for our double mutant achieved slightly more than double the papain-inhibitory activity of the commercial egg white cystatin. These results will be reported elsewhere.
