Abstract The -aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) is a member of a growing family of intracellular membrane trafficking and/or fusion proteins and has been implicated in plasma membrane targeting and clustering of GABAA receptors. GABARAP interacts with microtubules and the 2 subunit of GABAA receptor and modulates channel kinetics. From crystal structures of GABARAP in high salt concentration it has been proposed that oligomerization of GABARAP might take place in a head-to-tail fashion. In this study, we report that GABARAP self-associates and dimerizes in physiological salt concentrations. We find no evidence for higher order complex larger than a dimer. By using deletion constructs of GABARAP we show that interaction takes place between amino acid 36 and 68. We further narrow the interacting domain by inhibiting the selfassociation, by adding GABARAP-derived synthetic peptides in GST pull-down assays and shows that the interaction specifically takes place in the previously identified GABARAP-GABAA receptor interaction domain from amino acid 41­51. The identification of binding domains in GABARAP allows for the study of GABARAP functions, including GABAA receptor dynamics.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Proper functioning of the nervous system depends on specialized organization and concentration of ligandand voltage-gated ion channels in certain postsynaptic membrane domains. The specific targeting and clustering of different neurotransmitter receptors are essential to accommodate diverse synaptic input and efficient neurotransmission (Sheng and Wyszynski, 1997; Froehner, 1993; Ehlers et al., 1996). The majority of the fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system is mediated by the GABAA receptor, a ligand-gated chloride channel (Olsen and Macdonald, 2002). In cultured hippocampal neurons, clusters of GABAA receptors were

found at sites apposed to GABA-releasing terminals. GABAA receptor clustering was also shown in spinal neurons and cerebellar granule cells, and might require specific subunit composition (Craig et al., 1994; Kannenberg et al., 1999; Caruncho et al., 1995; Nusser et al., 1995). Several mechanisms have been proposed for GABAA receptor targeting and clustering, including the involvement of microtubules and some cytoskeleton related molecules, such as gephyrin, rapsyn and GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) (Wang et al., 1999; Vannier and Triller, 1997; Phillips et al., 1991). Gephyrin, a microtubule-associated protein and the glycine receptor-clustering molecule (Kirsch et al., 1991; Kirsch et al., 1993; Feng et al., 1998; Kneussel et al., 2000), has been shown to co-localize with clustered GABAA receptors and GABARAP. Gephyrin interacts with GABARAP in vitro and in cells (Kneussel et al., 2000). In gephyrin null mutant mice, the cluster formation of GABAA receptors decreased (Kneussel et al., 1999). The acetylcholine receptor clustering molecule, rapsyn (Hill, 1992), appeared to promote GABAA recep-

tor aggregation in heterologous cells (Yang et al., 1997; Ebert et al., 1999). However, no direct interaction has been demonstrated between these molecules and the GABAA receptor (Kirsch et al., 1995), and the low expression level of rapsyn in the brain excludes its role as a key GABAA receptor-clustering molecule. GABARAP was recently identified to co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize with GABAA receptors (Wang et al., 1999). Interestingly, GABARAP interacts directly with the intracellular loop of the 2 subunit, which is essential for receptor clustering (Essrich et al., 1998; Nymann-Andersen et al., 2002). In addition, GABARAP has sequence similarity to light chain 3 (LC3) of microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1A and 1B, and interacts with microtubules and microfilaments both in vitro and in vivo (Wang and Olsen, 2000). The binding activity of GABARAP to both cytoskeleton and GABAA receptors suggest its role as a linker molecule involved in receptor trafficking and/or clustering. However, how GABARAP mediates its receptor dynamic functions remains mostly elusive and has only recently been addressed by identification of functional domains (Wang and Olsen, 2000; Nymann-Andersen et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2000). In this study we identify GABARAP as a self-associating homodimer and identify an 11 amino acid interacting domain using biochemical approaches. We discuss the possible implications of a GABARAP homodimer in GABAA receptor dynamics. 2. Methods 2.1. Plasmids and the expression of recombinant proteins pGEX, pGEX-GABARAP1-117 and pGEX-GABARAP36-117 were used to generate GST and GST fusion proteins of GABARAP. These GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Non-fusion GABARAP1-117 was generated by thrombin treatment of GST-GABARAP1-117 and further purified. pET-GABARAP1-117, pET-GABARAP1-68 and pETGABARAP36-117 were used in the generation of 35S-labeled proteins by the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The expression of pET-GABARAP1-117, pET-GABARAP1-68 and pETGABARAP36-117 were controlled by the T7 promoter in the backbone plasmid. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. 2.2. GST pull-down assay and peptide inhibition assay The purified GST fusion proteins were charged to glutathione-agarose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). To pro-

duce 35S-labeled proteins, cDNA's of GABARAP1-117, GABARAP1-68, and GABARAP36-117 in pET-GABARAP1-117, pET-GABARAP1-68 and pET-GABARAP36-117 were used as templates in the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty five microliters of the in vitro translated product were incubated with 20 µl glutathione-agarose charged with 1 µg GST fusion proteins in 400 µl 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 60 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP40 and 1% milk (buffer A; 4 °C, 1 h). In the peptide inhibition assay, 250 µM and 1 mM peptide (IGDLDKKKYLV; Biosynthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX, USA) corresponding to amino acid 41­51 in GABARAP and 250 µM peptide (SDLTVGQFYFLIRKRIHL; Biosynthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX, USA) corresponding to amino acid 53­70 in GABARAP, respectively, were added in addition to buffer A. The agarose was washed four times by 500 µl buffer A, less 1% milk. The bound proteins were either eluted by 5 mM glutathione/10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 or in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-loading buffer. The eluted proteins were resolved on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography. The intensity of the bands were determined by Scion Image Bata 4.02 (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA) and subjected to statistical analysis. 2.3. Cross-linking experiments GABARAP was generated by thrombin treatment of GST-GABARAP1-117 and purified. Twenty micrograms of GABARAP were incubated with 1% formaldehyde (w/w) in 20 µl PEM buffer (80 mM piperazine-N,N'bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) sesquisodium salt, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA) at 4 °C for 1 h. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding a 2-fold molar excess of glycine with respect to formaldehyde, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. 2.4. Western blot analysis Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The membrane was incubated with polyclonal anti-GABARAP antibody (Wang and Olsen, 2000) (1:30,000 dilution) in TBSTween buffer with 3% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 h. HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used for the signal detection. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, unless stated otherwise.

3. Results 3.1. Self-interaction and dimer formation of GABARAP Self-association has been reported for some receptor clustering molecules (Ramarao and Cohen, 1998; Hsueh et al., 1997; Xiao et al., 1998) as well as for other microtubule-associated proteins (Togel et al., 1998). The self-association of GABARAP might be crucial for receptor regulation. By performing a GST pull-down assay, we find that 35S-labeled GABARAP36-117 interacts with GST-GABARAP36-117 (Fig. 1A). To address whether GABARAP forms dimer or higher order complexes, purified GABARAP1-117 was used in a crosslinking experiment and examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. We observe a 34 kDa band in both Coomassie blue stained gel (Fig. 1B) and Western blot (Fig. 1C), indicating dimer formation by GABARAP. No other form of multimers was detected. The GST pull-down assay indicates that the portion C-terminal to amino acid 36 of GABARAP is mediating its dimer formation.

3.2. Identification of the interaction domain in GABARAP dimerization To identify the interaction domain mediating GABARAP dimerization, and to assure that the interaction observed between GABARAP36-117 in Fig. 1A is not due to incorrect folding of the truncated GABARAP, a GST pull-down assay using GST-GABARAP1-117 and the following three 35S-labeled constructs of GABARAP, GABARAP1-117, GABARAP1-68 and GABARAP36-117, was performed (Fig. 2). All three constructs of GABARAP interact with GABARAP1-117, indicating that the dimerization domain is located between amino acids 36 and 68. Although the same amount of GST-GABARAP1117 was loaded in each lane, the likely variation in the amount of radioactive label product produced in the three GABARAP constructs makes a comparison of the intensity of the radiogram only an approximate indicator of their relative interaction strength. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the in vitro translated peptides of GABARAP will fold correctly into structural domains of full length GABARAP, making a quantitative comparison problematic in the first place. To confirm and further narrow down the interaction domain, a peptide inhibition assay was performed (Fig. 3). Based on results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 and inspection of the recently published 3-dimensional structure of GABARAP (Bavro et al., 2002; Coyle et al., 2002; Knight et al., 2002), two synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 41­51 and 53­70, respectively, were used in a GST-GABARAP1-117 pull-down assay along with 35S-labeled GABARAP1-117. Adding the peptide corresponding to amino acids 41­51 of GABARAP in concentrations of 250 µM and 1 mM was able to inhibit GABARAP-GABARAP interaction in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), with a statistically significant P-value of P 0.02. Adding the peptide cor-

responding to amino acids 53­70 in a similar experiment at a concentration of 250 µM failed to inhibit GABARAP-GABARAP interaction (Fig. 3B). At concentrations exceeding 250 µM, this particular peptide precipitated (data not shown). Taken together, these peptide inhibition experiments identify 11 amino acids in GABARAP important for GABARAP dimerization.

4. Discussion Cluster formation has been found to be universal for the major types of ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. GABARAP was identified as a potential GABAA receptor (GABAR) clustering protein through its interaction with the cytoskeleton and the 2 subunit of GABAR (Wang et al., 1999; Wang and Olsen, 2000). It is well known that GABAR synaptic clustering requires the presence of the 2 subunit (Essrich et al., 1998; Kneussel

et al., 1999; Nusser et al., 1995). In addition, GABARAP is able to promote GABAR clustering in Japanese quail QT-6 fibroblasts expressing GABARAP and recombinant GABAR containing the 2 subunit (Chen et al., 2000). The GABARAP-dependent clustered GABAR show different channel kinetics, conductance and doseresponse curves for GABA and modulatory drugs, compared to unclustered GABAR seen in the absence of GABARAP co-expression (Chen et al., 2000; NymannAndersen et al., 2002). These effects of GABARAP on GABAR function suggest that GABARAP might be associated with GABAR at synapses, perhaps as an anchoring protein. Indeed, the 3-dimensional structure of GABARAP suggested the ability to form aggregates which, together with microtubules, could produce dense clusters of GABAR as required at synapses (Coyle et al., 2002). However, immunolocalization of GABARAP with available antibodies in both cultured neurons and in brain sections, at the light (Kneussel et al., 2000; Kittler et al., 2001) and electron microscope level (Kittler et al., 2001) indicate that GABARAP is not colocalized with GABAR and gephyrin at synapses. Thus GABARAP would appear not to be an anchor, but to promote trafficking of GABAR from intracellular pools to the cell surface, and into and out of synaptic clusters. In other words, GABARAP can deliver one or more GABAR molecules and then leave the scene. Cell-permeable peptide inhibition of GABARAP and GABAR interaction in QT-6 cells suggests that interaction takes place early in GABAR biosynthesis (Nymann-Andersen et al., 2002). This is consistent with the interaction of GABARAP with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), a protein critical for intracellular membrane trafficking and fusion events (Kittler et al., 2001) and its homology to a Golgi-associated transport factor, Golgiassociated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE-16) (Paz et al., 2000). GABARAP also has been found to be associated with intracellular membranous organelles like endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi cisternae (Kittler et al., 2001), and often localized near the postsynaptic inhibitory membrane, consistent with delivery of membrane vesicles containing GABAR to the cell surface and synaptic membrane (Kneussel et al., 2000). These results together suggest that GABARAP plays a role in the transport of GABAR between intracellular membrane compartments and cell surface locations, as well as promoting receptor clustering. To address individual properties of GABARAP in GABAR dynamics, efforts have been made in identifying functional domains in GABARAP (Nymann-Andersen et al., 2002; Wang and Olsen, 2000). In this study we identified a GABARAP self-interaction and dimerization domain located between amino acid 41 and 51. The same 11 amino acids are involved in GABARAPGABAR interaction (Nymann-Andersen et al., 2002). In the recently published NMR and crystal structures of

480

GABARAP (Kouno et al., 2002; Stangler et al., 2002; Bavro et al., 2002; Coyle et al., 2002; Knight et al., 2002) and its close homologue GATE-16 (Paz et al., 2000), amino acids 41­51 partly constitute a highly conserved -sheet fold with basic residues near the edge of the sheet surrounding a region of partially exposed hydrophobic residues forming a likely intermolecular binding domain (Paz et al., 2000). The aggregation of receptor attachment molecules might be crucial and a prerequisite event for receptor clustering. Rapsyn, the acetylcholine receptor clustering protein, forms clusters when expressed in fibroblasts, possibly due to its self-association (Phillips et al., 1991; Ramarao and Cohen, 1998), while another coiled-coil region of rapsyn interacts with acetylcholine receptors (Ramarao and Cohen, 1998). The punctate expression of the glycine receptor clustering protein, gephyrin, was observed to take place prior to the clustering of glycine receptors in the developing brain (Bechade et al., 1996). When expressed in HEK cells, intracellular aggregates of gephyrin were observed, indicating that gephyrin might self-associate (Meyer et al., 1995). However, the clustering of gephyrin and the receptors (glycine or GABAR) may be inter-dependent. The clustering of gephyrin is significantly decreased in GABAR 2 null mutant mice (Essrich et al., 1998). Other molecules involved in receptor clustering and distribution have also been found to self-associate. PSD-95 forms head-to-head multimers by disulfide linkage (Hsueh et al., 1997). Chapsyn-110 hetero-multimerizes with PSD-95 (Kim et al., 1996). Within the Homer family, CC-homers, which contain a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, self-multimerize and form natural complexes and cross-link metabotropic glutamate receptors (Xiao et al., 1998). An extracellular immediate-early gene product, Narp, interacts with itself, forms surface clusters, and co-aggregates AMPA receptor subunits (O'Brien et al., 1999). When either GABARAP or GABAR were expressed alone in HEK cells, no clustered distribution was observed. When they were co-expressed, both GABARAP and GABAR re-distributed, formed aggregates, and co-localized (F. Bedford, N. Brandon, and S. J. Moss, personal communication). These findings do not exclude self-association and dimer formation due to limitations in pixel resolution, but are likely to exclude the extended oligomerization of GABARAP proposed recently from crystal structure (Coyle et al., 2002). It is feasible that self-association and dimerization are not sufficient for the clustered expression of GABARAP, and that other proteins are needed. However, the apparent overlap of domains in GABARAP that bind a second molecule of GABARAP and/or a receptor 2 subunit suggest that these events are mutually exclusive. Based on the current and previous studies, GABARAP has several functional domains. The first N-terminal 22 amino acids contribute to microtubule-binding activity

(Wang and Olsen, 2000). The GABAR interacting and dimerization domains are both situated in the region from residues 41 to 51, this study and (Nymann-Andersen et al., 2002). The identification of the self-association domain of GABARAP as being identical to the GABARAP-GABAR-binding domain raises some interesting questions about GABARAP in GABAR dynamics. It suggests that GABARAP dimerization is not simultaneous with receptor binding but rather an alternative. Microtubule binding may be possible for GABARAP dimers, but the dimer is apparently not involved in receptor binding or clustering. Future studies are needed to test the function of these domains in GABAR clustering and trafficking. These studies, and in particular the physiological relevance of dimerization, are most likely to be answered by mutational analyses in the binding domain. Current work in our laboratory is addressing these questions.
