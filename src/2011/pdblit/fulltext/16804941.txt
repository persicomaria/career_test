Abstract Previous studies have demonstrated that endoglucanase is required for cellulose biosynthesis both in bacteria and plants. However, it has yet to be elucidated how the endoglucanases function in the mechanism of cellulose biosynthesis. Here we describe the crystal structure of the cellulose biosynthesis-related endo- -1,4-glucanase (CMCax; EC 3.2.1.4) from the cellulose-producing Gramnegative bacterium, Acetobacter xylinum ( Gluconacetobacter xylinus), determined at 1.65-Å resolution. CMCax falls into the glycoside hydrolase family 8 (GH-8), and the structure showed that the overall fold of the CMCax is similar to those of other glycoside hydrolases belonging to GH-8. Structure comparison with Clostridium thermocellum CelA, the best characterized GH-8 endoglucanase, revealed that sugar recognition subsite 3 is completely missing in CMCax. The absence of the subsite 3 leads to significant broadness of the cleft at the cellooligosaccharide reducing-end side. CMCax is known to be a secreted enzyme and is present in the culture medium. However, electron microscopic analysis using immunostaining clearly demonstrated that a portion of CMCax is localized to the cell surface, suggesting a link with other known membrane-anchored endoglucanases that are required for cellulose biosynthesis.

Cellulose is well known as a major component of the plant cell wall, while several algae and bacteria also produce cellulose. Although various studies on cellulose biosynthesis have been carried out over the past several decades, the molecular mechanisms of -1,4-glucan chain initiation, elongation, and of microfibril formation have yet to be determined.1 The Gram-negative bacterium, Acetobacter xylinum ( Gluconacetobacter xylinus), has been studied as a model organism of cellulose biosynthesis.

produces a cellulose pellicle termed bacterial cellulose (BC) in culture medium. BC has outstanding characteristics in comparison with plant cellulose, such as high crystallinity, high tensile strength, and high purity.2 These properties of BC are very intriguing and thus motivate the development of new materials. The first discovery of the cellulose synthase operon in A. xylinum (AxCes operon) was a breakthrough in the research field of cellulose biosynthesis,3­ 6 which led subsequently to the identification of plant cellulose synthase homologs.7 In addition, two genes, cmcax and ccpAx (orf2), were also found to be located in the upstream region of the AxCes operon.8 The function of ccpAx has not yet been elucidated, while the cmcax gene was shown to encode a secreted enzyme, CMCax, that exhibits carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)- and cellooligosaccharide-hydrolyzing activity (endo- -1,4-glucanase activity). According to the CAZy (carbohydrate active enzymes) database (http:// afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/index.html),9 CMCax is classified as belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 8 (GH-8).

Interestingly, CMCax does not contribute to energy metabolism through glycoside-hydrolysis, but to the process of cellulose production. Nakamura et al. first reported that cellulose production by A. xylinum is enhanced by the addition of a small amount of Trichoderma viride cellulase to the production medium.10 Koo et al. provided evidence that CMCax plays a pivotal role in cellulose production.11 We also showed that CMCax impacts on cellulose ribbon assembly.12 In addition to CMCax, it was suggested that the endoglucanase CelC of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AgCelC), which also belongs to GH-8, may be involved in cellulose biosynthesis through conversion from lipidlinked intermediate to cellulose.13,14 AgCelC comprises a putative transmembrane domain at its N-terminus, and is thus considered to be a membrane-anchored enzyme. Similar to A. tumefaciens, plants are also known to utilize a membrane-anchored endoglucanase termed Korrigan (KOR) for cellulose biosynthesis.15,16 KOR is classified as belonging to GH-9, the overall fold of which is roughly similar to that of GH-8. In plants, sitosterol- -glucoside was found to serve as a primer for glucan chain polymerization, and the KOR is considered to function in cleavage of sitosterol- -glucoside from the growing chain, enhancing the efficiency of glucan chain elongation.17 Although the requirement of cellulose-hydrolyzing enzymes for cellulose production is paradoxical, these previous studies showed unambiguously that, in both bacteria and plants, an endoglucanase must somehow function as part of the intricate mechanism of cellulose biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the actual roles of these enzymes are still not clear. Here we report the first three-dimensional structure of the cellulose biosynthesis-related endoglucanase, CMCax, from A. xylinum. In addition, electron microscopic analysis using immunostaining showed that a portion of CMCax was localized at the cell surface, implying a link with membrane-anchored endoglucanases in both Agrobacterium and plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation, Crystallization, and Data Collection The expression, purification, and crystallization of A. xylinum CMCax were performed as described previously.12,18 Briefly, selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted CMCax was overexpressed in Escherichia coli B834 Codon Plus (DE3)-IRL (Stratagene) with a (His)6-tag at the N-terminus in place of the signal peptide. The enzyme was purified successfully by Ni2 -affinity, cation-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography. A single crystal of CMCax (Crystal I) was grown at 293 K by the hangingdrop vapor diffusion method against a reservoir solution containing 100 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.4, 15% (w/v) PEG 4,000, 3% (w/v) PEG 8,000, and 20 mM ammonium sulfate. The single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data were collected up to a resolution of 2.3 Å. The crystal was found to belong to the space group P61 with unit cell dimensions of a b 89.1 Å and c 94.2 Å. The crystallographic parameters and data collection statistics were described previously.18 Another crystal of larger

Prior to X-ray diffraction experiments, the crystal was rapidly soaked in reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol, and flash-cooled under a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. The crystal diffracted to a resolution of 1.65 Å. The complete X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline BL41XU at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) using an ADSC Quantum-Q315 Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector.

ture of selenium atoms was determined by a combination of Bijvoet difference Patterson analysis and direct methods with dual-space recycling using the program SHELXD,20 and the program SHELXE21 was used for initial phase calculation and density modification. At this step, the experimental electron density map was of sufficient quality for model building. The initial model of CMCax was generated with the program RESOLVE.22 The RESOLVE correctly placed 218 out of 334 residues (65.3%) in the asymmetric unit. The model extension and corrections were then performed automatically using the program LAFIRE23,24 in combination with the refinement program CNS version 1.1.25 The LAFIRE placed total of 306 residues (91.6%). After manual model building and fitting on the graphic program O,26 the atomic model consisting of 318 residues (95.2%; residues 24 ­341) was rebuilt successfully using the Se-SAD diffraction data ranging from 20 ­2.3 Å resolution, and was refined to Rwork 21.7% and Rfree 25.0% without water molecules. Subsequently, the model was further refined using the highresolution data ranging from 50 ­1.65 Å resolution with the program CNS,25 and the model was fitted manually on the

graphic program O.26 A randomly chosen 5% of all observed reflections were set aside for cross-validation analysis. After several rounds of refinement and manual model fitting, the water molecules were located automatically, and some of the molecules that occupied the irrelevant positions were deleted on the basis of real space correlation coefficient and/or maximum density level using the procedure in the program CNS. Finally, one sulfate ion was added manually to the model based on the strong peak of SIGMAA-weighted mFo DFc map and its consistent chemical environment. The Rwork and Rfree values ultimately converged. The programs PROCHECK27 and WHAT IF28 were used to assess the quality of the final refined model. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The atomic coordinates and the structure factor amplitudes of CMCax have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB; http:// www.rcsb.org/pdb/) with the accession code 1wzz.

amino acid sequence of CMCax (UniProt ID: P37696) as a query. Their amino acid sequences were obtained from the KEGG GENES database, and the amino acid sequences of proteins for which 3D structures have been determined but whose genome sequences are unclear were added. The amino acid sequences of CMCax from A. xylinum ATCC23769, CtCelA from Clostridium thermocellum, pXyl from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis were obtained from the UniProt database,30 and that of ChoK from Bacillus sp. K17 was obtained from PDB. The sequence similarity scores of all sequences were calculated using the SSEARCH 3.4t25 program with default parameters. Completelinkage hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the R (version 1.9.0) statistics program (http://www.rproject.org/) with logarithmic and sign-reversed SmithWaterman scores. Hydrolysis of p-Nitorophenyl- -D-cellopentaose (pNpG5) by CMCax and Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) The reaction mixture contained 0.025% (w/v) of pNpG5 and appropriate amount of the enzyme ((His)6-CMCax). Reaction conditions were 318 K, pH 4.5 and 2 h. Aliquots (0.5 L) of the reaction mixture were applied onto a TLC plate (Silica gel 60, Merck, Germany). A chloroformmethanol-water (90:65:15, v/v) solvent system was used and the spots were detected by heating the plate at 383 K

for 15 min after spraying it with solution of phenol and H2SO4 (phenol 3 g; concentrated H2SO4 5 mL; ethanol 95 mL). Immunostaining of CMCax and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) Observation A. xylinum was grown in HS medium at 303 K in static.12 A small portion of the culture was dropped on a copper grid (200 mesh), and incubated for 1 h at 303 K to allow cells to attach onto the grid. After washing with distilled water, the grid was soaked in fixative solution consisting of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 277 K overnight. The fixed cells were washed three times with M/15 sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 15 min each time. The grid was soaked in blocking solution consisting of 0.8% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 0.1% (v/v) Immuno Gold Silver Stain Gelatin (Amersham Biosciences K.K.) and 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (Wako) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 298 K for 30 min and washed three times with washing buffer (excluding normal goat serum from blocking buffer) for 5 min each time. Then, the grid was soaked in blocking solution containing 1/50 rabbit

anti-CMCax serum at 277 K overnight. After washing three times with the washing buffer for 5 min each time, the grid was soaked in blocking solution containing 1/50 secondary antibody (AuroProbe EM Anti-Rabbit IgG (H L) 15 nm Gold, Amersham Biosciences) at 298 K for 2 h. After washing with washing buffer, the adsorbed antibody was fixed with 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. The fixed sample was washed three times with PBS and distilled water for 5 min each time. The specimen was negative-stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution and washed with distilled water. The specimen was observed with an H-800 TEM (Hitachi HighTechnologies). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of CMCax The crystal structure of endo- -1,4-glucanase CMCax from A. xylinum was determined by the SAD method using SeMet-substituted crystal. The asymmetric unit was found to contain one CMCax molecule with a Matthews' coefficient VM value of 3.0 Å3Da 1.31 The electron density was of high quality throughout the molecule, except for the N-terminal 12 residues including the (His)6-tag and the C-terminal one residue (Lys342), for which there was no electron density. Although the crystal used for obtaining the 1.65 Å resolution dataset was grown in the presence of cellobiose, there was no well-ordered electron density corresponding to cellobiose (see Cellooligosaccharide Binding Site section below). The final refined model was composed of one complete polypeptide chain consisting of 319 residues (23­341), 312 oxygen atoms from water molecules, and one sulfate ion. The model has been refined with reasonable stereochemistry, using reflections 17.6% and ranging 50 ­1.65 Å resolution, to an Rwork Rfree 19.5%. Crystallographic parameters, data collection, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The structure of CMCax is composed of eleven -helices and seven -strands (Fig. 1). The overall fold of the enzyme is a so-called "barrel fold" created by all 11 -helices, i.e., five anti-parallel pairs of -helices ( 2/3, 4/5, 6/7, 8/9, and 12/1) and an additional unpaired -helix ( 10) that surrounds the center of the molecule. This protein fold can be described as an ( / )6 barrel motif, which is a typical fold of enzymes belonging to GH-8, although one -helix, which corresponds to 11 in the other enzymes, is not formed in the CMCax structure. The 3D structures have been determined for several enzymes in the GH-8 family, and the overall folding topology of CMCax is closely related to these previously solved structures. Pairwise structural comparison utilizing the DALI server32 demonstrated that the root-meansquare deviations (RMSD) of corresponding C atoms between CMCax and C. thermocellum endoglucanase (CtCelA; PDB code, 1cem),33 between CMCax and P. haloplanktis endoxylanase (pXyl; PDB code, 1h12-A),34 and between CMCax and Bacillus sp. K17 chitosanase (ChoK; PDB code, 1v5d-A)35 were 2.3 Å for 290 C atoms (Z score, 30.6), 2.6 Å for 283 C atoms (Z score, 27.5), and 2.6 Å for

Cluster Analysis of CMCax Previous work demonstrated that the GH-8 family can be divided into three subfamilies depending on the position of the catalytic base residue.36 According to the method, CMCax was fell into the subfamily GH-8a, in

which every enzyme has the catalytic aspartate at the site corresponding to Asp278 in CtCelA. In the current study, we have performed cluster analysis to compare between CMCax and other members of the GH-8 family in terms of similarities of the amino acid sequences (Fig. 2). SSEARCH is a program to compare sequences (nucleic acid or protein) and uses William Pearson's implementation of the method of Smith and Waterman37 to search for similarities between one sequence (the query) and any group of sequences of the same type (nucleic acid or protein) as the query sequence. A cluster dendrogram of the GH-8 proteins was obtained from the similarity scores (SmithWaterman scores) calculated by the SSEARCH program, and the proteins of the GH-8 family can be divided into two clusters. Interestingly, we found that the subdivision of GH-8 family by SSEARCH correlates with genomic conPROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

text around genes of the GH-8 family. Cluster I consists of endoglucanases from various bacteria, such as Escherichia sp., Pseudomonas sp., A. tumefaciens, and A. xylinum. All organisms in the cluster I, with the exception of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia pestis, have genes that encode proteins homologous to the cellulose synthase from A. xylinum in proximity to the endoglucanase gene. It is well known that A. xylinum and A. tumefaciens can produce cellulose. In addition, some bacteria in cluster I, including E. coli, were found to produce biofilms containing mainly polysaccharide.38 Therefore, it is likely that the endoglucanases in the cluster I are related to polysaccharide (cellulose) synthesis. On the other hand, cluster II consists of endoglucanases, xylanases, and chitosanases from various organisms. All organisms in the cluster II have fragmented cellulose synthase genes, which may result in loss of function, or have no genes for cellulose synthase homolog proteins. This suggests that the enzymes of cluster II are not related to polysaccharide production but to sugar metabolism as in the case of CtCelA that functions as cellulosomal component. Of GH-8 proteins, the structures of CtCelA, pXyl, and ChoK have previously been reported, 33­36, 39 ­ 40 all of which belong to cluster II. Very recently, the structure of reducing end xylose-releasing exo-oligoxylanase from Bacillus halodurans C-125 (Rex; BH2105 in Fig. 2) has been determined,41 which also belongs to cluster II. Therefore, this is the first report of the 3D structure of a polysaccharide (cellulose) biosynthesis-related endoglucanase belonging to the cluster I in the GH-8 family. Cellooligosaccharide Binding Site CtCelA is an endo- -1,4-glucanase with an inversion of anomeric configuration, and is one of the best-characterized enzymes based on several crystal structures, including ultra high-resolution (0.94 Å) analysis.

Conserved catalytic residues are highlighted in yellow, and the aromatic residues forming sugar recognition subsites are shown in blue. Secondary structure elements as determined in the present study are also shown. Cellulose biosynthesis-related A. tumefaciens endoglucanase C (AgCelC) is included in this alignment (see Cellooligosaccharide Binding Site in Results and Discussion). The alignment was partly performed with CLUSTALW.45

found to exhibit essentially identical enzymatic characteristics to CtCelA.12 However, structure comparison at the active site between CMCax and CtCelA revealed notable differences. CtCelA utilizes five aromatic residues for sugar recognition by stacking interactions. These residues correspond to Trp205, Trp132, Tyr372, Tyr277, and Tyr369, and create five sugar-recognition subsites, 3, 2, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.39 Superimposition at the active site structure (Fig. 3) revealed that the two residues corresponding to Trp205 and Tyr369 of CtCelA are not conserved in CMCax. Phe167 of CMCax seems to play an identical role as Trp205 of CtCelA, and may create subsite 3, while an aromatic residue corresponding to Tyr369 of CtCelA is missing in the CMCax structure, leading to significant broadness of the cleft at the cellooligosaccharide reducingend (Fig. 4). These observations suggested that subsite 3 is not present in CMCax. To clarify the absence of sugar recognition at subsite 3, we performed the TLC analysis of hydrolyzate formed by incubation of CMCax with pNpG5. The result clearly shows that only pNpG2 and cellotriose are detected as reaction products (Fig. 5), strongly supporting the absence of subsite 3 in the CMCax structure. We reported previously that the CMCax shows hydrolytic activity only for cellopentaose or longer cellooligosaccharides as substrates.12 The previous results and the present crystal structure indicate that the catalytic reaction proceeds only when all five subsites (from 3 to 2) are occupied with cellooligosaccharide. One of the structures of CtCelA was determined in complex with cellobiose.33 In contrast to CtCelA, although crystals of CMCax were successfully obtained in solution containing an excess of cellobiose, the present structure

analysis disclosed that the cellobiose did not bind to the enzyme. It is likely that lattice forces do not result in the lack of cellobiose binding, because the sugar binding cleft is completely exposed to the solvent region in the crystal lattice. Also, like other GH-8 enzymes, the CMCax is a single globular structure and has no ability to undergo conformational changes such as hinge motion for sugar binding. It is therefore suggested that, due to the abovedescribed structural differences at the cellooligosaccharide recognition site, CMCax could not immobilize cellobiose molecules at the active-site cleft. The absence of subsite 3 of CMCax is consistent with the homology model of Populus tremula x tremuloides KOR42 and the expected structure of AgCelC. The homology model showed that the KOR belonging to the GH-9 family probably accommodates six subsites from 4 to 2 for substrate recognition, and the subsite 3 is presumably not present in the KOR. In addition, the sequence alignment between members of GH-8 strongly suggested that subsites 3 and 1 are missing in AgCelC due to the extensive deletion of its C-terminal sequence (Fig. 6). These observations clearly showed that the absence of subsite 3 is a common feature among cellulose biosynthesis-related endoglucanases. It has been speculated that KOR may function in cleavage of the lipid-linked glucose from the reducing end of the growing glucan chain,17 and it has been reported that AgCelC may act as transferase rather than as an endoglucanase during cellulose synthesis.14 The absence of subsite 3 may account for the recognition of such lipid-linked cellooligosaccharide. To date, however, the relationship between cellulose synthesis and lipid-linked cellooligosaccharides in A. xylinum has

not been clarified, and the actual role of CMCax in cellulose production process remains to be determined. Cell-Surface Localization of CMCax KOR and AgCelC comprise a transmembrane domain at the N-terminus, and are thus considered to be membraneanchored enzymes. In contrast, CMCax is known as a secreted protein distributed in the culture medium. However, immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated the localization of CMCax on the cell surface (Fig. 7), suggesting a link with membrane-anchored KOR and AgCelC. In light of the 3D structure, the cell-surface localization of CMCax was quite unexpected, because the mature CMCax forms a single globular structure and has no additional domains that can interact with other proteins or polysaccharides. Therefore CMCax could directly interact with certain polysaccharides or proteins on the outer membrane. On the other hand, Standal et al. reported that the culture growth medium of wild-type A. xylinum contains CMC-hydrolyzing activity.8 Furthermore, the addition of exogenous endoglucanase to the culture medium enhances cellulose production by A. xylinum.10,43 These observations and the results of present study indicate that CMCax must be distributed on both the cell surface and in the culture medium, presumably with distinct functions.
