Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a key CNS-specific autoantigen for primary demyelination in multiple sclerosis. Although the disease-inducing role of MOG has been established, its precise function in the CNS remains obscure. To gain new insights into the physiological and immunopathological role of MOG, we determined the 1.8-Å crystal structure of the MOG extracellular domain (MOGED). MOGED adopts a classical Ig (Ig variable domain) fold that was observed to form an antiparallel head-to-tail dimer. A dimeric form of native MOG was observed, and MOGED was also shown to dimerize in solution, consistent with the view of MOG acting as a homophilic adhesion receptor. The MOG35-55 peptide, a major encephalitogenic determinant recognized by both T cells and demyelinating autoantibodies, is partly occluded within the dimer interface. The structure of this key autoantigen suggests a relationship between the dimeric form of MOG within the myelin sheath and a breakdown of immunological tolerance to MOG that is observed in multiple sclerosis.

ultiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the CNS characterized by localized myelin destruction and axonal degeneration (1). An autoimmune reaction against myelin antigens of the CNS contributes to the immunopathological mechanisms of this enigmatic disease. This concept is supported by observations in patients with MS such as elevated levels of lymphocytes reactive to myelin antigens, the presence of oligoclonal Ig in the cerebrospinal fluid, and perivascular inflammatory cell invasion of the CNS (2). Immune responses to abundant proteins of the CNS myelin sheath, proteolipid protein (PLP), and myelin basic protein (MBP) are thought to produce some of the pathological lesions in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, there is another important autoantigen linked to the pathogenesis of both MS and EAE, the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), which is a minor component of the myelin sheath ( 0.05% of total myelin protein) (3). In susceptible animals, immunization with native or recombinant MOG, or MOGderived peptides, or passive transfer of MOG-specific T cells and autoantibodies against MOG elicits a severe neurological disease that mimics many of the clinical, pathological, and immunological features of MS (2, 4, 5). A number of encephalitogenic epitopes of MOG (MOG1-22, MOG35-55, and MOG92-106) have been identified (4, 6, 7). MOG35-55, in particular, is a potent encephalitogen that, in contrast to MBP and PLP, elicits striking inflammatory and demyelinating immune responses in the CNS not only in various species but also across different strains of mice (5, 6, 8). The ensuing MS-like disease is characterized by relapses and remissions, extensive neural inflammation and demyelination, axonal injury, and the production of antibodies to MOG (5, 7­10). Moreover, antibodies to MOG are directly associated with myelin damage in the marmoset model of EAE as well as in the CNS of patients with MS (10). The epitopes recognized by mAb 8-18C5 and other demyelinating mAbs to MOG are conformawww.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.1833158100

tion-dependent (11), whereas antibodies against linear epitopes of MOG do not induce widespread demyelination (12). MOG is a type I integral membrane protein possessing a single extracellular Ig variable domain (Ig-V) (3, 13, 14). The amino acid sequence of MOG is highly conserved among animal species ( 90%), indicative of an important biological function. MOG is specifically expressed in the CNS on the outermost lamellae of the myelin sheath as well as the cell body and processes of oligodendrocytes (3). The developmentally late expression of MOG correlates with the later stages of myelinogenesis, suggesting that MOG has a role in the completion, compaction, and or maintenance of myelin, further suggesting that MOG has an adhesive function within the CNS (3). Consistent with MOG's possible adhesive role in the CNS, a homodimeric form of MOG has not only been observed after isolation from the CNS but has additionally been observed in situ (15). In addition, MOG may also have an immune-related function because it binds C1q, and thus could be a regulator of the classical complement pathway (16). We have determined the 1.8-Å crystal structure of MOG extracellular domain (MOGED) to further our understanding of the function of this protein and to elucidate its role in the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases of the CNS. Methods mature mouse protein, containing an amino terminal sixhistidine tag, was produced in the Escherichia coli strain M15 (pREP4) by using the pQE9 expression vector (Qiagen, Melbourne, Australia). After expression and preparation of a cleared lysate per the manufacturer's instructions, MOGED was purified by using Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions (6 M guanidine HCl), per the manufacturer's instructions, on a BioLogic LP Chromatography System (Bio-Rad). The column was washed to remove nonspecifically bound material, and bound protein was refolded directly on the column by using linear gradients of denaturing versus nondenaturing solutions. After elution with 300 mM imidazole in sodium phosphate Tris (pH 8.0), MOGED was dialyzed against 50 mM NaCl 5 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and concentrated to 1.3 mg ml.

A final round of refinement was undertaken in CNS. The final model, comprising residues 2­117, 215 water molecules, and two sulfate ions, has an Rfactor of 20.1% and an Rfree of 23.7% (Table 1).

Native MOG was purified from human brain by affinity chromatography with the MOG-specific monoclonal antibody 8-18C5 (22). Myelin proteins (2.5 g per lane) and purified native MOG were resolved on 12% SDS PAGE gels.

Tetragonal-shaped crystals were grown by mixing equal volumes of MOGED with the reservoir buffer (14­18% polyethylene glycol 4000 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6). The crystals were flash frozen before data collection by using 10% glycerol. All data were collected in-house on an R-AXIS IV detector with CuK x-rays generated by a Rigaku (Tokyo) RU-H3RHB rotating anode generator and focused by using Osmic (Auburn Hills, MI) mirrors. The diffraction data were processed and analyzed by using D*TREK (17) and programs from the CCP4 suite (18). The crystals diffracted to 1.8 Å and belong to space group I41 with unit cell dimensions a b 65.7 Å and c 67.6 Å, consistent with one monomer per asymmetric unit. A summary of statistics is provided in Table 1. by using a combination of molecular replacement (AMORE), manual rebuilding in O (19), and the ARP/WARP procedure (20). The progress of refinement was monitored by the Rfree value (3% of the data). The starting model for molecular replacement was a domain from B7.2, with all differences mutated to alanine and the majority of loops removed. The highest peak in the rotation function also gave the highest peak in the translation function that packed well within the unit cell. Inspection of the electron density map suggested that the solution was correct although the phase information was poor. Given the high resolution of the data, ARP/WARP was tried; however, this procedure failed initially.

A 4% stacking gel was used in all experiments. The gels were run for 30 min at constant voltage of 200 V with SDS-running buffer (0.1 M Tris 0.38 M glycine, pH 8.8). The gels were stained with Coomassie blue.

Structure Description. The structure of MOGED has been determined to 1.8-Å resolution (Fig. 1). As predicted from sequence data, the overall structure of MOGED adopts a topology of an Ig-V domain (Fig. 1) with overall dimensions of 40 35 30 Å. The structure adopts a compact, -sandwich domain with one antiparallel -sheet (strands A, B, E, and D) packing against a mixed -sheet (strands A , G, F, C, C , and C ) with the N and C termini at opposite ends of the molecule. In addition to the -strands, there are four 310 helices located at the periphery of

the molecule. The core packing residues of MOGED are similar to what is observed in other Ig-V domains, namely a canonical disulfide bond (Cys-24­Cys-98) that packs against the consensus residue (Trp-39), as well as the conserved and buried salt bridge between residues Arg-68 and Asp-92. The three loops at the membrane-distal end of MOGED that connect the B­C, C ­C , and F­G strands have been termed Loops 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These loops are in the homologous location of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs 1, 2, and 3, respectively) of the Ig-V domains. The three loops combine to form a polar and essentially uncharged flat face in which His-103 at the tip of Loop 3 protrudes. MOGED possesses a significant strip of electronegative charge that runs about half the length of the molecule, terminating at a small band of electropositive charge (Arg-4, Arg-25, Lys-80) (Fig. 2 Upper). This electronegative strip is dominated by residues at the N-terminal region of the B -strand (Asp-18, Glu-19, Glu-21) but also contains Glu-74 and Glu-116. Surface-exposed hydrophobic patches can also be indicative of regions that mediate protein­protein and or ­ligand interactions. MOGED possesses a number of solvent-accessible hydrophobic residues, including three aromatics: Tyr-10, Phe-44, and Phe-90 (Fig. 2 Lower). against other Ig-V domain structures revealed MOGED to be the most structurally homologous to sialoadhesin (rmsd 1.6 Å for 105 C atoms), despite sharing only 24% amino acid sequence identity. Additionally, a number of significant matches were made with other receptors identified in cell adhesion receptor­ ligand interactions, including b7-2 (25), adenovirus receptor D1 domain (CAR) (26), myelin protein zero (P0) (27), and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) (28). In comparing the structure of MOGED to sialoadhesin (29) and P0, the core secondary structural elements superimpose well, reflecting the conserved core-packing residues (Fig. 3). The major structural differences reside at the A­A interconnecting region, Loop 1, the C­C loop, part of Loop 2, residues 73­78, and residues within Loop 3.

interactions neither exhibited an extensive interface nor displayed significant shape complementarity. In the third crystal contact region, however, MOGED was observed to lie on a crystallographic twofold, forming an antiparallel, head-to-tail dimer within the lattice. This dimer interface (Fig. 4) is extensive, burying 1,800 Å2 of surface area, excluding water molecules. Furthermore, the shape complementarity index at the dimer interface is high (0.7), representing a value that is comparable to that observed in antibody­antigen interactions. Taken together, these global features, namely an extensive interface exhibiting high shape complementarity, suggest that the crystallographic MOGED dimer may represent a biologically relevant MOG dimer. The dimer interface runs along the long axis of the molecule, with interactions predominantly involving the extreme N terminus, the interconnecting loop between A and A strands (residues 8­11), the C­C loop (residues 40­46), and the F­G strand -hairpin (residues 95­112) (Figs. 4 and 5). The interface is dominated by van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. There are 10 direct hydrogen bonds per protomer: Gly-9O to Glu -107OE1; Pro-11N to Glu -107OE1; Ser-45OG to Ser -45OG; Thr-97OG1 to Thr -97OG1; Glu-106NE2 to Glu -112OE1; Glu107OE1 to Gly -9O; Glu-107OE1 to Pro -11N; Glu-108OE2 to Glu -112OE1; Glu-112OE1 to Gln -106NE2; Glu-112OE1 to Gln 106OE2. Residues from the F­G -hairpin participate extensively at this interface, with water molecules being largely excluded from this F­G -hairpin area of the interface (Fig. 5 Upper). The small side chain of Ala-110 interacts with its counterpart. Ala-109 and Ala-110 are flanked by long acidic side chains of Glu-112, Glu-108, and Glu-107 that cluster to form an unusual triad of residues that interact at the interface. The periphery of this interface is dominated by the polar side chains Gln-106 and Tyr-105. Adjacent to Ala-109 is a water-filled cavity that mediates interactions with the A­A strand loop. This loop is unusual in that it bulges away from the body of the Ig-V fold, toward the dimer interface (Fig. 5 Upper). Within this bulged loop is the prominent aromatic, Tyr-10, which is fully solvent-exposed in the monomer but in the dimeric state stacks between the aliphatic moieties of Gln -2 and Arg -4 from the opposing protomer.

The C­C loop (residues 40­46) (Figs. 1 and 5 Lower) interacts with each other, in an orientation that is 70° to that of the -hairpin-mediated interaction. This loop contains two aromatics, Phe-44 and Tyr-40, and a cis proline, Pro-43, that packs against Tyr -40 and Phe -99. The side chain of Phe-44 is completely solvent-exposed and does not form intersubunit contacts with its side chain. The main chain of Phe-44 does, however, form van der Waals contacts with Ser -45, a residue that hydrogenbonds onto itself. There are a number of water-mediated hydrogen bonds centered around this loop (Fig. 5 Lower). Native MOG has been repeatedly reported to exist as a mixture of monomeric and dimeric species (3, 15, 22). We also observed that, in Western analysis, the MOG-specific monoclonal antibody, 8-18C5, recognizes proteins with relative mass of 26­28 kDa (monomeric MOG) and 54 kDa (dimeric MOG) in CNS myelin from mouse and human brain as well as native MOG purified from human brain (Fig. 6A). To confirm that the observed MOGED dimer was not merely due to crystal packing artifacts, several biochemical techniques were used to ascertain whether MOGED formed a dimer in solution. Firstly, we performed cross-linking studies, using an approach that has proved informative in other studies examining receptor self-association (30). In the presence of the primary amine-coupling agent DTSSP, increasing concentrations of MOGED lead to the formation of a MOGED species with the
Clements et al.

Moreover, to confirm the role of MOG35-55 in the formation of the MOGED dimer we immobilized biotinylated 35­55 peptide on a streptavidin sensor chip and analyzed binding by Biacore. MOG ED (10 g ml) specifically bound the immobilized MOG35-55 but displayed no binding to the MOG92-106 (Fig. 6E), confirming that this region is important for dimer formation. A control protein displayed no binding to the peptide (data not shown). Discussion The three-dimensional structure determination of MOGED (Fig. 1) represents a detailed structural analysis of an MS-related autoantigen. We have demonstrated that MOGED adopts an Ig-V fold and forms a head-to-tail dimer (Fig. 4), and because all of the residues mediating these dimeric contacts are conserved among species (Fig. 3), this probably represents a common mode of dimerization. The observed dimer interface was extensive and exhibited significant shape complementarity, features that argue against the observed MOGED dimer representing merely a crystallographic artifact. Importantly, a dimeric species of MOG was also observed after isolation from the CNS, as well as in situ. Moreover, we have demonstrated (Fig. 6) that MOGED has a propensity to specifically dimerize in solution. The affinity for the dimer must be weak, however, because the predominant species isolated from gel filtration was monomeric. Many receptors containing this fold, for example P0, have additionally been observed to display weak affinities (mM range) of self-association. Unfortunately, the concentration-dependent oligomerization of MOGED could not be ascertained by using analytical ultracentrifugation, because the maximal concentration of MOGED that could be achieved was only 1.3 mg ml. In addition, the dimerization was not observed to be salt- or pH-dependent. Mutation of a number of key residues at the dimer interface (Fig. 5) would be predicted to disrupt the level of observed dimerization. We propose that the observed dimer represents not only the dimeric form of MOG that is obtained after isolation from the CNS, but also the dimeric form that has been observed in vivo. Although we consider it unlikely, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the dimeric species observed in vivo (15, 22) is mediated via a cis interaction or that the dimerization domain may additionally reside in the transmembrane cytoplasmic domain. Supporting the evidence that this dimeric form of MOGED exists in vivo, receptors that are structurally related to MOGED, such as P0 (27), JAM (28), and CAR (26), likewise self-associate similarly to mediate adhesion (in trans) between opposing membranes. For example, P0, the major protein of myelin of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), functions to mediate membrane adhesion within the myelin sheath, also forms a head-totail dimer (27). Moreover, the contact regions involved correspond to those that mediate intersubunit contacts within the MOGED dimer, namely the extreme N terminus (residues 1­7) and residues from the C strand (27). As stated previously, several features favor the role of MOG as an adhesin in the completion and or compaction of the myelin sheath (3). Our hypothesis is that MOG acts as an adhesin in trans, possibly functioning to abut opposing membranes and thereby acting as an adhesive glue between neighboring myelinated fibers. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that in the PNS, where MOG is not expressed, myelin sheaths do not appear to be in contact with each other (22). Other proteins contain self-associating Ig-V domains and additionally interact with heterologous receptors (31). Thus, as well as the observed homophilic association, MOGED may interact heterologously, and certain observations support this view. For example, MOG possesses three loops that are analogous to the CDR loops of IGV domains, a significant electroPNAS September 16, 2003 vol. 100 no. 19 11063

relative mass of 29 kDa, corresponding to the expected size of a dimer (Fig. 6B). We next determined whether the absence of denaturing agents such as SDS may affect the relative amounts of the monomeric and dimeric species of MOGED. Whereas SDS PAGE and analytical gel filtration show that MOGED exists primarily as a monomer, native PAGE revealed the presence of two protein species, which is again consistent with a mixture of dimeric and monomeric forms of MOGED (Fig. 6C). The high level of purity of the MOGED sample was verified by mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown). Given the topology of the dimer, the His-tag is unlikely to influence the observed dimerization. In addition, blue native PAGE analysis allowed us to determine the relative mass of the MOGED species. Two species were resolved as in native PAGE, with their masses corresponding approximately to those of the 26- and 14-kDa markers (Fig. 6D).

negative strip, and an exposed aromatic residue (Phe-44 of the C­C loop) (Fig. 2), features that may represent a potential binding site (32). Interestingly, Tyr-44 of sialoadhesin, the structural equivalent of MOGED Phe-44, interacts with the ligand, sialic acid (29). One candidate ligand for MOG is the complement component C1q (33), which was shown to bind specifically in vitro to MOG. Several MOG-derived peptides are encephalitogenic, but the most promiscuous among these is MOG35-55, for which immunization induces a severe demyelinating disease in several animal models (23). Also, MOG35-55 has been identified as an immunodominant epitope for T cell responses in MS (34). Our finding that MOG35-55 forms an integral part of the MOGED dimer (Fig. 4) interface leads us to speculate that the spatial location of this peptide and its participation in the dimeric structure are critical aspects in loss of immune tolerance to this particular sequence. Of interest, the two other regions of MOG that map to the dimer interface (Fig. 4) (MOG1-22 and MOG92-106) are also encephalitogenic in several animal models (4, 6), further supporting a relationship between localization of peptides within the MOG dimer interface and induction of demyelinating disease. Peptides that lay deeply buried within MOG may not be easily released during antigen processing and therefore do not induce tolerance during development. Introduction of the peptide later in life, either experimentally or as a result of myelin damage, could cause disruption of the MOG dimer and so may then stimulate pathogenic immune responses given a suitable MHC background. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that in contrast to MOG35-55, induction of disease by immunization with MOGED requires processing by antigen-presenting cells (35, 36).

Aside from T cells, MOG is also a known B cell autoantigen in both EAE and MS (10­12). Various MOG-specific autoantibodies cannot be mapped to any linear sequence in the MOGED and hence appear to recognize a conformational epitope (6). Not unexpectedly, conformation-dependent antibodies seem more efficient at inducing demyelination than those recognizing linear epitopes (12). In Lewis rats immunized with MOG35-55, antibodies to the peptide are associated with severe EAE, and fine epitope mapping of these antibodies reveals MOG37-46 as an immunodominant region (7). This region is located at the dimer interface, an observation that raises two considerations. First, these MOG37-46 autoantibodies could preferentially recognize the dimeric form of MOG, and this ability, which for example might mimic the natural ligand, may be related to their demyelinating activity. Second, given that the epitope is partly buried at the dimer interface, some autoantibodies may only recognize MOG after the dimer is disrupted. Further experimental evidence is required to clarify these considerations. The MOGED structure suggests a link between the physiological function of MOG and its immunopathological features in MS. This work could eventually lead to the development of therapeutics designed to interfere with the anti-MOG T and B cell response in patients with MS.
