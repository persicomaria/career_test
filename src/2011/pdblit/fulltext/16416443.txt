ABSTRACT Both monomeric and dimeric NADP -dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) belong to the metal-dependent -decarboxylating dehydrogenase family and catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation from 2R,3S-isocitrate to yield 2-oxoglutarate, CO2, and NADPH. It is important to solve the structures of IDHs from various species to correlate with its function and evolutionary significance. So far, only two crystal structures of substrate/ cofactor-bound (isocitrate/NADP) NADP -dependent monomeric IDH from Azotobacter vinelandii (AvIDH) have been solved. Herein, we report for the first time the substrate/cofactor-free structure of a monomeric NADP -dependent IDH from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgIDH) in the presence of Mg2 . The 1.75 Å structure of CgIDH-Mg2 showed a distinct open conformation in contrast to the closed conformation of AvIDH-isocitrate/NADP complexes. Fluorescence studies on CgIDH in the presence of isocitrate/or NADP suggest the presence of low energy barrier conformers. In CgIDH, the amino acid residues corresponding to the Escherichia coli IDH phosphorylation-loop are -helical compared with the more flexible random-coil region in the E. coli protein where IDH activation is controlled by phosphorylation. This more structured region supports the idea that activation of CgIDH is not controlled by phosphorylation. Monomeric NADP specific IDHs have been identified from about 50 different bacterial species, such as proteobacteria, actinobacteria, and planctomycetes, whereas, dimeric NADP -dependent IDHs are diversified in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We have constructed a phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of all bacterial monomeric NADP -dependent IDHs and also another one with specifically chosen species which either contains both monomeric and dimeric NADP -dependent IDHs or have monomeric NADP -dependent, as well as NAD dependent IDHs. This is done to examine evolutionary relationships. Proteins 2006;63:100 ­112.

INTRODUCTION Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is one of the key enzymes in the Kreb's cycle which provides energy and biosynthetic precursors for metabolism. Depending on coenzyme specificity, the IDH family can be divided into NAD - and NADP -dependent groups. The reaction catalyzed by NAD -dependent IDH is allosterically regulated by AMP, citrate, and its catalytic products (NADH and 2-oxoglutarate) whereas NADP -dependent IDH catalyzes the same reaction in a reversible manner but no allosteric control has been identified.1 NADP -dependent IDH is further classified into homodimeric and monomeric structural forms. Whereas all eukaryotes and most prokaryotes have homodimeric NADP -dependent IDHs with two identical subunits of 40 ­50 kDa each, a monomeric form with molecular mass of 55­ 80 kDa has been found only in some bacterial systems. There is 10% amino acid sequence identity between homodimeric and monomeric NADP -dependent IDH enzymes. These studies suggest that two different forms of NADP -dependent IDH could have evolved separately. However, partial sequence alignment revealed that the catalytic residues between homodimeric and monomeric NADP -dependent IDH are fairly conserved indicating the possibility that one single unit of monomeric IDH could function similarly to two subunits of homodimeric IDH.2 The relationship between homodimeric and monomeric NADP -dependent IDH had not been envisioned until the first monomeric IDH structure at 1.8 Å resolution was published [Protein Data Bank (PDB); 1ITW].3 The crystal structure of monomeric IDH from Azotobacter vinelandii (AvIDH) revealed the presence of two distinct domains within a single polypeptide chain. The active site residues in AvIDH are conserved among monomeric IDH enzymes from all sources. Although the isocitrate and metal binding sites are similar

among monomeric and dimeric IDHs, the NADP recognition site evolved independently in homodimeric and monomeric NADP -dependent IDHs.4 Functionally, NADP -dependent IDHs are a member of the -decarboxylating dehydrogenase family and catalyze the decarboxylation of 2R,3S-isocitrate into 2-oxoglutarate, CO2, and NADPH. 2-Oxoglutarate can be further oxidized within the citric acid cycle or can produce glutamic acid by the reduction with glutamate dehydrogenase and the product, NADPH, can be used as an energy source for biosynthetic reactions.5 In some bacteria and plants, an alternate metabolic pathway, the glyoxylate bypass, is induced when acetate is the sole carbon source.6 Extensive studies of Escherichia coli IDH (EcIDH) showed that phosphorylation of Ser113 makes EcIDH completely inactive and the bacterium can utilize the glyoxylate bypass.7­12 The enzyme IDH-kinase/phosphatase (IDH-K/P) induced a conformational change around residue 113 in order to bind and transfer a phosphoryl group to Ser113 to make the enzyme inactive.9 From the structural studies on human cytosolic NADP -dependent IDH (HcIDH), it has been proposed that two interconvertible conformational states of similar energy exist in mammalian NADP dependent IDH.13 The closed conformation seems to be induced by the movements of the small domain with respect to the large domain when isocitrate binds to the catalytic site of the enzyme. It is suggested that interconversion between these conformational states in HcIDH could regulate its catalytic activity and would have a role in its function because similar conformational changes to control its enzymatic activity were also observed in EcIDH during the phosphorylation cycle.10,13 Evolutionary analysis indicates that bacterial NADP dependent IDHs evolved from an NAD -dependent precursor about 3.5 billion years ago.14 Comparative studies and evolutionary relationships on IDHs from the diversified families in respect to cofactor specificities, primary structures, and oligomeric states have been performed where NADP -dependent monomeric IDHs were excluded, because of the lack of sequence homology with the other forms of IDHs.15 The structural studies on AvIDH suggested that NADP -dependent monomeric IDH evolved from the dimeric IDHs.3 Previously, Colwellia maris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two gram-negative gammaproteobacteria, were identified which contain both the NADP dependent IDHs in homodimeric and monomeric forms. Now rapidly growing genomic studies provide us information for at least 10 species that have both the monomeric and dimeric NADP-IDHs out of 50 different bacterial species containing monomeric NADP -dependent IDHs. A few of these 50 species (such as Idiomarina loihiensis GI: 56460541; Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum GI: 23016634; Xanthomonas axonopodis GI: 21244559; Xanthomonas campestris GI: 21233210) contain instead both NADP -dependent monomeric and NAD -dependent IDHs, which is more common in eukaryotic organisms. A gram-positive, nonpathogenic actinobacteria, Corynebacterium glutamicum, is known as an amino acidproducing organism because it is widely used in industry

for the large-scale production of amino acids, such as lysine and glutamate, for animal nutrition.16 The icd gene encoding monomeric NADP -dependent IDH from C. glutamicum has been identified.6 Preliminary purification and crystallization of CgIDH as well as initial X-ray diffraction studies were successfully performed in our laboratory.17,18 Herein, we report the crystal structure of a CgIDH complex with Mg2 . The first substrate-free structure of a monomeric NADP -dependent IDH from CgIDH has been compared with the known structure of substrate/ cofactor bound AvIDHs.3,4 Fluorescence studies have been performed to examine possible conformational changes in the presence of substrate and cofactor. Because the specific activity of C. glutamicum IDH is independent of the growth medium and the IDH-K/P is absent in C. glutamicum, inactivation of IDH by phosphorylation of Ser130 (which is equivalent to Ser113 of EcIDH) and possible activation of the glyoxylate bypass has been reconsidered. We have constructed a phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of all bacterial monomeric NADP-IDHs. We have also constructed another tree for a few specifically chosen species that have both NADP -dependent IDHs in monomeric and dimeric forms as well as for a few species that have both NADP -dependent monomeric and NAD dependent IDHs, to examine a possible evolutionary relationship. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Purification Monomeric IDH from C. glutamicum was purified as previously described, except that the gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography steps were eliminated.17 The C. glutamicum cells that harbored the plasmid pEKicdES, containing the icd gene, were inoculated in 5 mL of LB medium containing kanamycin (30 g mL 1) and shaken at 30°C overnight. The overnight culture was transferred to and incubated in 500 mL of LB medium with kanamycin and shaken at 30°C overnight. The growth culture was harvested through centrifugation at 6,000 g at 4°C for 20 min. The cell pellet was stored at 80°C.17 The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (25 mM 2-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.2, 2.5 mM MnSO4, and 2.5 mM DTT)] and disrupted by ultrasonication at 50 W (5 1 min bursts with 6-min intervals). The sonicated solution was centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4°C for 20 min. The supernatant containing IDH was transferred to a fresh tube, and activity assay was performed on the crude extract. The cell lysis and activity assay steps were repeated 10 times until no activity was detected in the crude extract. In this way, the maximum amount of IDH could be obtained from the crude extract. Ammonium sulfate (35­ 80% cut) at room temperature in solid form was added to the pooled crude extract while stirring on ice. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4°C for 20 min after incubation on ice for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in a minimal volume of Buffer A and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. The dialyzed protein solution was loaded on a preequilibrated Red Sepharose CL-6B affinity column with Buffer A containing 20 mM

NaCl, and then the column was washed with 10 the bed volume of Buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl. Monomeric IDH protein was then eluted with Buffer A containing 4 mM trisodium-DL-isocitrate. The fractions containing high enzymatic activity were pooled together and their purity was checked by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against Buffer A. IDH was concentrated up to 10 mg/mL using an UltraFree Amicon centrifuge tube (Millipore). DTT (2.5 mM) and 10% glycerol were added to the concentrated protein solution that was stored at 80°C. Crystallization and Structure Determination Crystallization of CgIDH was performed by the hangingdrop vapor diffusion method at room temperature under the conditions previously described by Audette et al.18 Reservoir solution was made of 25% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), and 0.2 M MgCl2, whereas the drop consisted of 1 L of CgIDH at a concentration of 5 mg mL 1 and 1 L reservoir solution. A CgIDH crystal with dimensions 0.3 0.1 0.05 mm was obtained within a week. The CgIDH crystals were cryoprotected by soaking successively in a series of mixtures of reservoir and glycerol solutions from 10 to 25% (v/v) in 5% (v/v) increments, followed by transfer to light paraffin oil. X-ray diffraction data were collected on Beamline 14ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The dataset was collected from a single CgIDH crystal on a MAR CCD detector (MAR Research) at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystem). Diffraction images from the flashcooled crystal were taken at 1° increments per frame (10 s exposure per frame) for a 180° total rotation of the phi axis. The diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the program package HKL2000.19 The structure of CgIDH-Mg2 was solved by Molecular Replacement by the use of the CNS program using the AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 complex as a starting model (PDB; 1ITW).3,20 The structure was examined with TURBO-FRODO and refined using CNS.20,21 The coordination of Mg2 cation was confirmed with the Hetero-compound Information Center in Uppsala (HIC-UP), Sweden and was included in further refinement.22 The final structure was examined using the routine PROCHECK from the CCP4 package (CCP4, 1994).23 The RCSB PDB ID is 2B0T for CgIDH. The rotation angle between one domain of one structure and the equivalent domain of another structure was calculated using LSQKAB from the CCP4 package.24 Fluorescence Spectrometry Studies Fluorescence spectroscopic studies were performed at room temperature using the fluorescence spectrometer F-2500 (Hitachi). A KAC buffer (25 mM 3-[N-morpholino] propane sulfonic acid pH 7.3, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT) was used as a dilution and a reference buffer. Setting excitation wavelength at 297 nm with 10-nm excitation and emission slits, fluorescence spectra were measured at 310 ­550 nm. No fluorescence was observed for the KAC buffer, isocitrate, or NADP by itself at 250 ­350 nm. About 30 ­50 g mL 1 protein was used to obtain the fluorescence spectra.

RESULTS The Structure of CgIDH-Mg2 The structure of CgIDH-Mg2 was solved and refined to a resolution of 1.75 Å. There are four symmetry-related CgIDH molecules well packed in the unit cell. Each molecule of CgIDH in the refined crystal structure consists of 735 amino acid residues (of a total of 738 residues in the CgIDH sequence). Electron density was not observed for the first N-terminal residue and for the last two Cterminal residues. There are 475 water molecules refined in the final structure. One divalent metal ion, Mg2 , was observed adjacent to Asp346. The structure was analyzed by the program PROCHECK from the CCP4 package.23 The final Rwork and Rfree values were 0.20 and 0.23, respectively. A total of 91% of the residues in the CgIDH structure were within the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot.25 Both Glu13 ( 39 and 124) and Glu418 ( 53 and 136) were in the generously allowed region but were in excellent density in the 2Fo-Fc map, confirming the validity of their unusual dihedral angles. The estimated mean coordinate error from the Luzatti plot analysis was 0.24 Å.26 The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The tertiary structure of CgIDH-Mg2 consists of two distinct domains as occurs in the other monomeric AvIDH structures [Fig. 1(A)].3,4 The small domain (Domain I) is formed with 316 amino acid residues from both the N- and C-termini; the large domain (Domain II) is composed of 422 residues. A cleft region was observed between these two domains and is expected to contain the active site, as occurs in the other monomeric IDHs. There are 14 -helices and 6 -strands in Domain I, and 14 -helices and 16 -strands in Domain II. A pseudo two-fold axis was present only in Domain II [Fig. 1(B)], which is analogous to the crystallographic two-fold axis in the homodimeric IDH structures. All of the residues at the catalytic site that have been described in the structures of AvIDH are donated by the two domains in an asymmetric manner and are located in the cleft region.3 The identity of the corresponding active site residues are conserved between AvIDH and CgIDH.3 NADP -dependent IDH requires a divalent ion for catalysis. Magnesium chloride was added for the crystallization of CgIDH, and it was highly expected that bound Mg2 would be found in the structure. One Mg2 was indeed observed adjacent to Asp346 at the active site in the structure. This cation is coordinated in an octahedral geometry by Asp346 O 1, Asp544 O 2, Asp548 O 1, the carbonyl oxygen atom of Asp544, and two water molecules (Fig. 2). The overall mean coordination distance is 2.22 Å. According to the geometrical data of metal-ligand interaction, the coordination number for Mg2 is commonly six and there is octahedral geometry. The average metalligand distance is 2.26 Å when a metal is coordinated by the carboxylates of Asp or Glu.27 The coordination distances and geometry in the structure of CgIDH-Mg2 confirm that the bound metal is magnesium ion.

change takes place upon binding of the substrate isocitrate and cofactor NADP . Furthermore, from the fluorescence spectra max, the wavelength at which maximum fluorescence intensity was detected, did not shift by more than 1­2 nm, indicating that the Trp residues in CgIDH were not exposed to water by substrate binding. Thus, the fluorescence intensity of CgIDH was quenched in the presence of NADP and was enhanced in the presence of isocitrate, indicating that binding of either NADP or isocitrate to CgIDH may induce a conformational change that does not involve the exposure of the Trp residues to water. When CgIDH was titrated with isocitrate in the presence of NADP or vice versa, the fluorescence emission of CgIDH at 335 nm was greatly reduced and the fluorescence emission at 460 nm was largely increased (Fig. 3). The increase of the fluorescence emission at 460 nm indicates the formation of NADPH. The phosphorylation loop in EcIDH is composed of several glycine residues indicating its flexibility, which can be confirmed by its random coil conformation [Fig. 4(A)]. The corresponding amino acid residues in CgIDH [Fig. 4(B)], equivalent to the phosphorylation loop in EcIDH, is highly structured and -helical in nature whereas it forms a mixture of -helix and random coil structure in HcIDH [Fig. 4(C)]. Phylogenetic Studies Initial sequence alignment between all the species containing NADP -dependent IDHs was performed using ClustalW.28,29 The phylogenetic tree structures based on maximum likelihood tree methodology were constructed using the Phylip program to see the evolutionary relationship between the species.30 All the monomeric NADP dependent IDHs have 50% amino acid sequence identity. Table II depicts the list of all bacterial species that contain monomeric NADP -dependent IDHs with their GI number from NCBI. In Table II, species that contain other IDHs also have been listed. The cladogram constructed, based on protein sequences of 50 bacterial species having NADP -dependent monomeric IDHs, nicely grouped the similar species together (Fig. 5). The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6) was constructed in the same way from the species that have either both the monomeric and dimeric NADP dependent IDHs, or monomeric NADP -dependent IDH and NAD -dependent IDH, or a few species that have well studied dimeric NADP -dependent IDHs, e.g., E. coli, human, and porcine. The analysis showed a few interesting observations. As a result, all bacterial monomeric NADP -dependent IDHs were grouped together, all NAD dependent IDHs were in the same group, and also bacterial dimeric NADP -dependent IDHs were placed in the same group with two exceptions. Notably, bacterial dimeric NADP -dependent IDHs from Mycobacterium bovis and Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum were placed in the same group with mammalian dimeric NADP -dependent IDHs.

Conformational Changes of CgIDH Upon Binding to Substrate(s) Fluorescence spectroscopic analyses were performed to examine if any conformational changes can be detected in CgIDH after binding of its substrate and cofactor. Upon addition of Mg2 , no change in fluorescence intensity for the enzyme was observed. The changes in relative fluorescence intensity ( max 335 nm) were noticed when either isocitrate (1.2 mM) or NADP (0.08 mM) was added to the CgIDH solution. An approximate 31% quenching of the fluorescence was induced when NADP was added, whereas an approximate 15% increase in fluorescence occurred in the presence of isocitrate (data not shown). These changes in the fluorescence intensities for CgIDH suggest that a conformational

DISCUSSION Domain Movement Observed Between the Structures of CgIDH-Mg2 and AvIDH Complexed With Isocitrate-Mn2 When the structure of CgIDH-Mg2 was superimposed on the structure of AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 , using the LSQKAB program from the CCP4 package, the structure of CgIDH-Mg2 showed a more open conformation than did the structure of AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 [Fig. 7(A)].24,31 The root-mean-square difference between the equivalent -carbon atoms of Domain I and Domain II of the two

structures is 0.8 Å and 1.8 Å, respectively. When Domain I of CgIDH and AvIDH were overlaid by LSQKAB, the calculated rotation angle of Domain II of CgIDH with respect to Domain II of AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 was 24°. Domain II is closer to Domain I in the AvIDH-isocitrateMn2 complex than the distance between Domain II and Domain I of CgIDH-Mg2 [Fig. 7(A)]. The superimposed structure of CgIDH-Mg2 onto the structure of AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 revealed that the analogous residues at the isocitrate-Mn2 binding site of CgIDH had moved in concert with the domain shift

Fig. 2. Stereo diagram of the coordinating geometry of Mg2 in the CgIDH-Mg2 structure.

[Fig. 7(B)]. Most residues at the active site are donated from Domain II, especially Arg143, Lys253, Asp346, and Tyr416 in CgIDH that were shifted 5 Å, compared with the equivalent residues present in AvIDH-isocitrateMn2 . When isocitrate was modeled at the equivalent position in the structure of CgIDH-Mg2 , by superimposing the two enzyme structures, isocitrate would be further away from the analogous active site residues of Domain II in CgIDH. Thus, the analogous active site residues in CgIDH can not interact with isocitrate because of the open conformation [Fig. 7(C)]. It is clearly indicated that the open cleft in the structure of CgIDH could not mediate interaction of isocitrate with the residues at the active site. These observations lead to the proposal that this open conformation could be the inactive form of CgIDH that allows substrate to enter and then two domains move together to bind substrate at the active site for catalysis to occur. Because of highly conserved structural features between CgIDH and AvIDH, it is expected that CgIDH could undergo a conformational change when isocitrate is bound to the enzyme.3 The change of fluorescence emission of CgIDH in the presence of isocitrate suggested conformational changes occurred upon binding of isocitrate to CgIDH in solution. Taken together with the structural observation, it is suggested that a domain shift in CgIDH could be induced upon binding of isocitrate at the active site. Coordination Geometry of Mg2 and Mn2 NADP -dependent IDH is a metalloprotein, and it requires either Mg2 or Mn2 for enzyme catalysis. One Mg2 was found in the structure of CgIDH in the absence of isocitrate and NADP . In the structure of CgIDH-Mg2 , Mg2 was hexa-coordinated with octahedral geometry by the side-chains of Asp346O 1, Asp544O 2, and Asp548O 1, the carbonyl oxygen of the main chain of Asp544, and two water molecules, whereas Mn2 in the structure of AvIDHisocitrate-Mn2 was hexa-coordinated with octahedral geometry by two Asp residues, two water molecules, and two oxygen atoms of isocitrate (Fig. 8).3 First, because of the absence of isocitrate in the structure of CgIDH, Mg2 is coordinated by an extra Asp residue, Asp548, and by the carbonyl oxygen of the main chain of Asp544. Because of the open conformation of CgIDH, the Mg2 was also

positioned further from the corresponding residues that interact with isocitrate in the structure of the complex of AvIDH. From the superimposed structure of CgIDH-Mg2 onto the structure of AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 the corresponding distance from Mg2 to one of the oxygen atoms of isocitrate (which coordinates Mn2 in AvIDH) increased from 2.1 to 8.2 Å. It is, therefore, proposed that the position of Mg2 would move in concert with the conformational change of CgIDH in the presence of isocitrate to coordinate isocitrate at the active site for catalysis.

Domain Movement Induced Upon Binding of NADP in Monomeric IDH A domain shift between the 3.2 Å resolution structure of AvIDH complexed with NADP (AvIDH-NADP ) and AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 has been proposed.4 When the structure of CgIDH-Mg2 was superimposed onto the structure of AvIDH-NADP , Domain II was even more shifted toward Domain I than that observed in the structure of AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 [Fig. 9(A)]. Domain II of

the structure of CgIDH-Mg2 appeared to differ by a rotation of 35° relative to Domain II of the structure of AvIDH-NADP . Unlike the residues of Domain I at the isocitrate-Mn2 binding site, the equivalent superimposed residues at the NADP -binding site of the structure of CgIDH-Mg2 onto those in the structure of AvIDHNADP were correspondingly close in positions. The sidechains of Arg600 and Arg649 also seemed to rotate toward the 2 -phosphate moiety in the presence of NADP , which allows these residues to interact with NADP . Because these Arg residues at the NADP -binding site were less affected by a domain shift induced in the presence of isocitrate-Mn2 , binding of NADP may result in not only a more closed conformation at the active site but also in the movements of the residues interacting with NADP during catalysis. The change of fluorescence emission of

CgIDH in the presence of NADP also supports the idea of a conformational change of the enzyme in the presence of NADP . Combined with the structural observation, it is evident that the domain shift in CgIDH could also be induced upon binding of NADP at the active site. The Low Energy Barrier Between Closed and Open Conformation of CgIDH Exhibiting a conformational change is one of the common characteristics of some enzymes during catalysis. The closed inactive form of AvIDH complexed with either isocitrate-Mn2 or NADP is quite unique compared with the open inactive form of HcIDH complexed with either isocitrate-Mn2 or NADP .4,13 A domain shift between the structures of AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 and AvIDH-NADP has been proposed.4 The side-chains of Arg600 and Arg649

also seemed to rotate toward the 2 -phosphate moiety in the presence of NADP , which allows these residues to interact with NADP . Because these Arg residues at the NADP -binding site were less affected by a domain shift induced in the presence of isocitrate-Mn2 , binding of NADP may result in not only a more closed conformation at the active site but also in the movements of the residues interacting with NADP during catalysis [Fig. 9(B)]. Now the question is how the substrate isocitrate can penetrate the active site to perform the catalytic reaction. In both complexes, the two domains of AvIDH do not have any extra hydrogen bonds, ion pairs, or hydrophobic interactions and it was suggested that a low energy barrier exists between the closed and open conformation.4,11 Previous kinetic studies showed that CgIDH has a 10-fold lower Km value toward isocitrate and a three-fold lower Km for NADP than homodimeric EcIDH.2 The specificity of CgIDH toward isocitrate and NADP might indicate the

formation of a low energy state closed conformation by forming more contacts.9 The change of conformation of CgIDH can also be observed from the change in fluorescence of CgIDH in the presence of isocitrate or NADP which also supports the change in conformation of CgIDH to resemble AvIDH bound to isocitrate or NADP . The formation of NADPH has been confirmed from the gradual increase of emission spectra at 460 nm when CgIDH was titrated with NADP in the presence of isocitrate and Mg2 or with isocitrate in the presence of NADP and Mg2 . The result shows that order of addition of NADP or isocitrate is not important for the reaction to occur. The formation of NADPH is a direct proof that catalytic reaction is occurring. Thus, the fluorescence results support the presence of a low energy barrier between CgIDH complexes with isocitrate or NADP , which permits the access of the other substrate or cofactor to perform the catalytic reaction. So, it can be proposed that the IDH

enzyme family could exist in the open and the closed conformations that are energetically interconvertible for catalysis. Regulation of IDH Activity Unlike NAD -dependent IDH, NADP -dependent IDH enzymes are not allosterically regulated.1 Homodimeric EcIDH is well known to be regulated through the phosphor-

ylation cycle catalyzed by IDH-K/P.8,32 It is also known that inhibition of E. coli IDH by phosphorylation regulates the branch point between the Kreb's cycle and glyoxylate bypass, which is an alternate route to accumulate carbon metabolites when acetate is the sole carbon source for growth. The phosphorylation of IDH in E. coli protein is controlled by IDH-K/P. This IDH-K/P is absent in C. glutamicum. The specific activity of C. glutamicum is also

independent of the growth medium.5 Both studies indicate that IDH activity is not regulated by the phosphorylation/ dephosphorylation mechanism. The phosphorylation loop in EcIDH has random coil conformation which indicates its flexibility. In CgIDH, the region corresponding to the phosphorylation loop in EcIDH is -helical in nature. This more structured -helical loop also supports the idea that activation of CgIDH is not controlled by phosphorylation of Ser130, which is a conserved serine residue (analogous to Ser 113 in EcIDH) in all NADP -dependent IDHs. In HcIDH, this loop region is partially helical. Because the phosphorylation of HcIDH has not been reported, it has also been proposed that the conformational change of HcIDH could be induced upon binding of isocitrate and could be directly related to the regulation of enzymatic activity in HcIDH.13

Molecular Evolution Regardless of the amino acid sequence alignments that show 10% identity between homodimeric EcIDH and monomeric NADP -dependent IDHs, isocitrate and divalent metal cation binding sites were well conserved among the structures of EcIDH and monomeric NADP -dependent IDHs from bacterial species as well as in eukaryotic dimeric NADP -dependent IDHs. The equivalent residue to Ser113 in EcIDH identified from the structural studies on AvIDH was Ser132 that corresponds to Ser130 in CgIDH, Ser94 in HcIDH which is completely conserved among monomeric and dimeric NADP -dependent IDH enzymes from other sources. The equivalent residue to Lys230 (prime represents the residues from the second subunit in the dimeric enzyme) in EcIDH, Lys253 in CgIDH, was also completely conserved in both homodimeric and monomeric IDHs. The coordination geometries of isocitrate and Mn2 in the structure of the complex of AvIDH were similar to those in the structures of complexes of EcIDH and HcIDH. Isocitrate is coordinated by equivalent Ser, Arg, Lys, and Tyr residues, and the divalent metal cation is coordinated by the equivalent Asp residues, two water molecules, and two oxygen atoms of isocitrate. One major difference is the absence of the second active site in monomeric IDH attributed to the lack of the domain that is equivalent to Domain A in the second subunit of homodimeric IDH.3 Besides the absence of the second active site, the structures of both ho-

modimeric and monomeric IDH established that the wellconserved active site could be formed for the identical catalysis even though their primary structures were 10% identical. These conserved active sites imply not only the evolutionary relationship among homodimeric and monomeric IDH enzymes but also similar tertiary structures for the proteins that catalyze the identical reaction but have minimal identity of amino acid sequence to other members of the enzyme family. P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. syringae, and P. fluorescens all belong to the same group in genus Pseudomonas. Between these four species, P. putida, P. syringae only have monomeric NADP -IDH, P. fluorescens has both monomeric and dimeric forms, and P. aeruginosa has both monomeric, dimeric NADP -IDHs, as well as IDH-K/P (Table II). This might be a good indication that all of them might have initially had all three types of IDHs, but they lost the other forms during evolution based on their needs. The bacterial species containing monomeric NADP dependent IDH belong to different phylum such as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and also one from Planctomycetes (Rhodopirellula baltica) (Table II). The cladogram based on monomeric NADP -dependent IDHs will be very important to correlate their structure and function in the future. The phylogenetic tree indicates a few interesting observations. They nicely grouped NADP -dependent monomeric and dimeric IDHs as well as NAD -dependent IDHs all together. Another interesting finding is the placement of bacterial Mycobacterium bovis and Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum into the group of eukaryotic human and porcine IDHs instead of placing them into the bacterial dimeric section. It indicates that dimeric eukaryotic and prokaryotic NADP-IDHs might have evolved from the same precursor. The position of C. glutamicum in the tree is also very interesting. It is also closer to the human or porcine than to other monomeric or dimeric IDHs of bacterial species. It is also known that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK), an enzyme important in gluconeogenic pathway, from C. glutamicum has a GTPdependent nucleotide specificity similar to human PCK rather than to ATP-dependent PCKs which are more common in bacterial species.33 So, C. glutamicum is a very interesting evolutionary species to study. CONCLUSIONS A phylogenetic tree based on maximum likelihood tree methodology grouped all bacterial monomeric NADP dependent IDHs together and all NAD -dependent IDHs together. Notably bacterial dimeric NADP -dependent IDHs were placed in the same group except for Mycobacterium bovis and Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum IDHs which were placed in the same group as the mammalian dimeric NADP -dependent IDHs. This indicates that the dimeric eukaryotic and the dimeric prokaryotic NADPIDHs might have evolved from a common ancestor. Fluorescence studies suggest that substrate free CgIDH as well as substrate/cofactor-bound CgIDH-isocitrate/NADP can undergo conformational changes in solution. This suggests that substrate/cofactor bound CgIDH-isocitrate/NADP can

undergo domain movement to provide access for the second substrate/cofactor to interact. Between the two structures of AvIDH complexes, AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 has a more open structure than the AvIDH-NADP complex which might result from the process of the crystallization as discussed by the authors.4 The monomeric NADP dependent IDH structure consists essentially of two domains, I and II. When Domain I of CgIDH-Mg2 and AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 were overlaid, the calculated rotation angle of Domain II of CgIDH with respect to Domain II of the AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2 was 24°. This indicates that Domain II in the AvIDH complex is closer to Domain I than occurs in the structure of CgIDH-Mg2 . Thus, the structure of substrate/cofactor free CgIDH-Mg has a distinctly open conformation like other substrate free -decarboxylating dehydrogenases.
