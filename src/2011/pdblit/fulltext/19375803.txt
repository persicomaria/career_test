THE VALENCE STATES OF MANGANESE ION IN POTASSIUM-BORATE OXIDE GLASSES I. Ardelean, Gh. Ilonca and M. Peteanu Faculty of Physics, University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania

(Received 12 June 1984 by S. Amelinckx)
EPR and magnetic susceptibility measurements have been performed on xMnO- (I -- x) [2B203' K20] with 0 ~<x ~< 50 mol %. The X-ray diffraction analysis showed that in this glass system homogeneous glasses are formed up to x = 70 mol %. EPR and magnetic susceptibility data have shown that in the glasses withx <~ 5 mol% only Mn2 ions are present as magnetically isolated species. EPR spectra are modified with the increasing of manganese ions content. In the concentration range 0.5 ~<x <~ 5 mol %, the spectra are characterized by appearance of three resonance absorptions at g = 4.3 and g "" 3.3 without hyperfine structure, and at g "~ 2.0 with hyperfine structure. For the glasses with x > 5 mol %, the resonance spectra are characterized by the appearance of the broad line at g = 2, characteristic for clustered ions. The magnetic susceptibility data suggest the appearance of superexchange interactions for x > 5 mol %. From Curie constant values and qualitative chemical analysis we have established that in the glasses with x/> 10 mol % both, Mn:÷ and Mn3÷ ions are present. SEVERAL EXPERIMENTAL results suggest that the valence states and distribution mode of the transitionmetal (TM) ions in the network of the oxide glasses depend on the matrix structure [1 ], preparation conditions [2] and the nature of the TM ions [3]. Up to now, the EPR [4-6] and magnetic susceptibility [7] studies of the oxide glasses with manganese ions suggest the presence of Mn 2÷ ions, which may participate in superexchange interactions. In order to extend the board of information on these problems, we have studied the xMnO- (1 -- x) [2B2Oa · K20] glasses, with 0 ~<x ~< 50 mol %, using the EPR and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The samples were prepared from H3BO3, K2COa and MnCOa using the previously reported technique [8]. The X-ray diffraction analysis showed that in this glass system homogeneous glasses are formed up to x = 70 mol %. The qualitative chemical analysis of these glasses indicates the presence of both, Mn 2÷ and Mna÷ ions. The EPR measurements were performed at 9.4 GHz using a JEOL-JES-3B equipment at 295 K. The magnetic data were obtained using a Faraday type balance in the temperature range 80 to 750 K. We present the typical EPR spectra for these glasses in Fig. 1. EPR spectra for glasses with x ~< 5 mol % are characterised by resonance absorptions at g --~ 4.3, g "" 3.3 and six hyperfine lines centered at g --~ 2.0, their intensities being strongly dependent on composition. The resonance absorption at g ~ 4.3 is typical for isolated Mn2÷ ions in sites which have undergone rhombic distortion from the cubic symmetry [5 ] and the absorption atg = 3.3 may appear even in strong cubic field [6]. At the resonance absorption at g = 2.0 participate the Mn2÷ ions which experience dipoledipole [8] and superexchange [5] interactions. Thus at this resonance absorption, participate the Mn2÷ ions which form clusters of more than one manganese ion involved in magnetic superexchange interactions [5 ]. After 5 mol % MnO the resonance lines situated at g ~2.0 become dominant overlapping the resonance lines at g -~ 4.3 and g ~ 3.3. The EPR data are in agreement with the results of magnetic susceptibility measurements. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal magnetic susceptibility of these glasses is presented in Figs. 2 and 3. For the glasses with x <~ 5 mol % a Curie law is observed. This suggests that in this concentration range are predominant the isolated manganese ions and no magnetic order is present. For x > 5 mol %, the reciprocal magnetic susceptibility obeys a Curie-Weiss behaviour with a negative paramagnetic Curie temperature - Op. For these compositions, the high temperature susceptibility data indicate that the manganese ions in the glasses experience negative exchange interactions and are coupled antiferromagnetically. In this case, the antiferromagnetic order takes place only at short-range and the magnetic behaviour of the glasses can be described by the socalled micromagnetic [9] or speromagnetic [10] type order. 147

To determine accurately the values of the Curie constants, CM, corrections due to the diamagnetism of the matrix and MnO were taken into account. The composition dependence of the Curie constant is presented in Fig. 5. For the glasses with x > 5 mol %, the experimental values obtained for Curie constant and consequently for atomic magnetic moments are lower than those which correspond to MnO content, considering that all manganese ions are in Mn~+ valence state. In this way, having in view the qualitative chemical analysis we consider that in these glasses are present both, Mn 2+ and Mn3+ ions. The presence of the Mn2+ ions was

This analysis was used to interpret the composition of the number of spins participating in resonances in the case of Fe 3÷ ions in lead-borate [13] and Mn 2÷ ions in lead-tellurate [5] oxide glasses. By means of EPR studies and magnetic measurements, the xMnO- (1 - - x ) [2B203 " K20] glasses with 0 ~<x ~< 50 tool % were studied obtaining information concerning the valence states of manganese ion distribution in the glass matrix, which explains their magnetic behaviour.

From these data it results that the molar fraction of the Mn 2÷ ions in these glassesincreases up to x = 40 mol %, and after that decreases.
