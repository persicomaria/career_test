Structure and catalytic cycle of b-1,4-galactosyltransferase
Boopathy Ramakrishnan1,2, Elizabeth Boeggeman1,2, Velavan Ramasamy1 and Pradman K Qasba1Ã
b-1,4-galactosyltransferase-1, a housekeeping enzyme that functions in the synthesis of glycoconjugates, has two flexible loops, one short and one long. Upon binding a metal ion and UDP-galactose, the loops change from an open to a closed conformation, repositioning residues to lock the ligands in place. Residues at the N-terminal region of the long loop form the metal-binding site and those at the C-terminal region form a helix, which becomes part of the binding site for the oligosaccharide acceptor; the remaining residues cover the bound sugar-nucleotide. After binding of the oligosaccharide acceptor and transfer of the galactose moiety, the product disaccharide unit is ejected and the enzyme returns to the open conformation, repeating the catalytic cycle.

Of the seven identified members of the b-1,4-galactosyltransferase subfamily (b1,4-Gal-T1 to -T7), b1,4-Gal-T1, known since 1962, was the first glycosyltransferase to be well characterized (biochemically), cloned and expressed (reviewed in [3]). It is a Golgi-resident type II membrane enzyme with a cytoplasmic domain, membranespanning region, and a stem region and catalytic domain facing the lumen. It has also been localized at the cell surface, functioning as a lectin [4]. In the presence of a transition metal ion, the catalytic domain of bovine b1,4-Gal-T1 (residues 130­402) transfers Gal to GlcNAc, which may be either free or linked to an oligosaccharide, generating a disaccharide unit, Galb14GlcNAc (N-acetyllactosamine). Many biologically active carbohydrate determinants built on this disaccharide unit mediate several biological events, making b1,4-Gal-T1 a key enzyme in glycobiology. Furthermore, b1,4-Gal-T1 interacts with a-lactalbumin (a-LA), a 123-residue protein produced in the mammary gland during lactation, to form a lactose synthase (LS) complex, which transfers Gal to glucose (Glc), producing lactose (Galb1-4Glc) [5,6]. It is important to recognize that, during evolution, the emergence of mammals is often associated with the appearance of a-LA and LS [7]. This review will focus on the structural basis of the catalytic mechanism of b1,4Gal-T1 and the LS complex.

Structure-based explanation of the catalytic mechanism of b1,4-Gal-T1
The transfer of the Gal moiety from UDP-Gal to an acceptor molecule by b1,4-Gal-T1 follows a sequential ordered mechanism [8,9]. The reactants add in the order Mn2+, UDP-a-Gal and GlcNAc (Figure 1). X-ray crystal structures of the catalytic domain of bovine b1,4-Gal-T1, in the absence or presence of sugar-nucleotide donor or acceptor substrates, or in complex with a-LA [10­ 12,13], together with other biochemical data, show that this enzyme system functions as an exquisite mechanical device [14]. The catalytic domain of the enzyme can be considered a two-domain protein, one a-helix rich and the other b-sheet rich, with substrate-binding sites located between these domains [12] (Figure 2a).

Introduction
The known galactosyltransferase subfamilies, b1,4-, b1,3-, a1,3-, a1,4- and a1,6-, mediate the transfer of galactose (Gal) from UDP-a-D-galactose (UDP-Gal) to a sugar acceptor, such as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), at the O-4, O-3 or O-6 position in the b- or a-configuration [1,2]. Each subfamily has members that use a specific oligosaccharide acceptor and are expressed in different tissues. Although sequence homology exists among subfamily members, little homology exists across the subfamilies.

Both the long and short loops of the catalytic domain of b1,4-Gal-T1 play crucial roles in its catalytic mechanism (Figure 2a,b). The short flexible loop has a tryptophan residue flanked by glycine residues (GWGG: residues 313­316 in bovine b1,4-Gal-T1), which allow rotary motion of the tryptophan (Trp314) [11]. This sequence

The reaction catalyzed by b1,4-Gal-T1 (E) follows a sequential ordered mechanism, wherein Mn2+ binds first to the enzyme (E­Mn2+), followed by UDP-Gal. The enzyme changes from an open to a closed conformation (asterisk), which creates an oligosaccharide-binding site. After a monosaccharide (MS) or an oligosaccharide acceptor binds, catalysis occurs and the product (Gal­MS) is ejected. The enzyme changes to the open conformation, with the release of UDP or UDP­Mn2+, and returns to a new cycle. If a-LA is present, it binds to the extended oligosaccharide-binding site, bringing a monosaccharide (MS and a-LA) into the binding pocket. After catalysis, a-LA dissociates and then disaccharide (Gal­MS) is ejected.

is highly conserved among b1,4-Gal-T family members from different species. The long flexible loop (residues 345­365) contains residues that are essential for interacting with the metal ion and substrates, including the most flexible residues (345­353) [12,13]. In the substrate-free enzyme (apo-enzyme) conformation -- the open conformation -- the short loop (containing the tryptophan sidechain) and the long flexible loop are oriented such that important residues participating in catalysis are distant from the substrate-binding pocket (Figure 2b) [10]. In the closed conformation, however, the long loop covers the sugar-nucleotide-binding pocket, creating the acceptor-binding site (Figure 2a). The conformational change can be induced by either low concentrations of sugarnucleotide donor and Mn2+, or high concentrations of acceptor [11,12]. In the latter situation, the lid closes on the sugar-nucleotide-binding site, making it a `dead-end' molecule for catalysis; the protein then acts as a specific lectin. For the protein to act as an enzyme during catalysis, it has to follow a sequential ordered [8,9] rather than a sequential random mechanism [15].
Metal ion binding

UDP-Gal binding

UDP-Gal binds to the metal­enzyme complex in the open conformation. The two anionic oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups of UDP replace two water molecules bound to the metal ion (Figure 2a). The Trp314 sidechain from the short flexible loop moves from the outside to the inside of the catalytic pocket (Figure 2b), making hydrophobic interactions with the Gal moiety and hydrogen bonding with the anionic oxygen of the bphosphate of UDP (Figure 2a). While the UDP-Gal molecule is locked in the binding pocket, the conformation of the long loop changes. The loop now covers the sugar-nucleotide and repositions residue His347 so that its sidechain coordinates the metal ion by replacing another bound water molecule (Figure 2a); this strengthens metal ion binding. Circular dichroism measurements had previously indicated a conformational change in the enzyme upon UDP-Gal binding [17]. In the Mn2+­UDPGal-bound complex, the long loop is in a closed conformation and the metal ion (Mn2+) is coordinated by three protein ligands (Asp254, Met344 and His347), two anionic oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups of UDP and a water molecule [12,13] (Figure 2a).
The role of Met344 in metal ion binding

Use of a Met344His mutant enabled us to dissect the intermediate steps of metal ion and UDP-Gal binding [16]. The metal ion first binds to the enzyme in an open conformation at the N-terminal hinge region of the long flexible loop (also discussed later) (B Ramakrishnan, V Ramasamy, PK Qasba, unpublished data). The two protein ligands, Met344 (His344 in the mutant) and Asp254, together with four water molecules, first coordinate the metal ion and then reduce the flexibility of residues in the hinge region, particularly that of His347. Nevertheless, the sidechain of His347 faces away from the metal ion when the long and short loops are in the open conformation (Figure 2b).
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2004, 14:593­600

Kinetic and binding affinity analyses of Asp254, Met344 and His347 mutants show that Asp254 and His347 are strong and non-substitutable metal-binding ligands [18]. Conversely, Met344, a weaker ligand, can be substituted by alanine, serine and glutamine with a 25­60% loss of Mn2+-dependent enzyme activity [18]. However, substituting histidine for Met344 reduces the Mn2+-dependent enzyme activity by 98%, whereas the mutant shows Mg2+dependent enzyme activity, which is not observed with the wild type [16]. The binding of the metal ion has two functions: to induce conformational change, together with

The role of Trp314 in substrate binding

In the Mn2+­UDP-Gal-bound enzyme complex, the Trp314 sidechain in the short flexible loop faces the binding pocket, holds the UDP-Gal molecule in place and subsequently interacts with the GlcNAc acceptor residue (Figure 2a). The tryptophan residue at the active center was inferred from studies indicating that UV inactivation destroyed a single tryptophan residue only in the absence of UDP-Gal and Mn2+ [19]. When alanine replaces Trp314, enzyme activity and binding to substrates and a-LA are reduced by approximately 99% [20]. Molecular dynamics simulations of b1,4-Gal-T1 for 10 ns, with an implicit solvent model and with explicit water, showed that the long loop moves toward the closed conformation, stabilizing in the intermediate position [21]. The tryptophan loop moves in the opposite direction, contacting residues in the long loop. Remarkably, restraining the flexibility of the tryptophan loop dramatically affects the movement of the long loop, so that no large conformational change takes place, suggesting that this residue communicates flexibility between the two loops. This is consistent with the observation that, when Trp314 is mutated to Ala314, the long flexible loop of the Trp314Ala mutant remains in a nearly open conformation (Figure 2b) and is more accessible to limited proteolysis by Glu-C or Lys-C proteases [20], indicating that Trp314 motion plays a vital role in the overall motion of the long flexible loop.
Interactions of the Gal moiety of UDP-Gal in the bound complex

Closed and open conformations of b1,4-Gal-T1. (a) Molecular structure of b1,4-Gal-T1 in complex with UDP-Gal and Mn2+. The enzyme can be considered a two-domain protein, one a-helix rich and the other b-sheet rich, with substrates binding between the domains. The long flexible loop, residues Ile345­His365, and the short flexible loop, residues Gly313­Gly316, are shown in purple and are in the closed conformation. The Trp314 sidechain is facing toward the binding pocket that interacts with UDP-Gal. Three protein ligands (Asp254, Met344 and His347), two phosphate oxygens and one molecule of water participate in the coordination of Mn2+. (b) The long flexible loop, residues Ile345­His365, and the short flexible loop, residues Gly313­Gly316, in the open (green) and closed (purple) conformations. The conformations of these loops in the Trp314Ala (W314A) mutant are depicted in orange. Residue His347 is facing away in the open (green) conformation and moves to coordinate the metal ion in the closed (purple) conformation (see Figure 2a).

Deep inside the catalytic pocket, the Gal O4 axial hydroxyl group hydrogen bonds with the sidechain carboxyl oxygen atoms of Glu317 and Asp318. These residues are present in the highly conserved EDDD motif of b1,4Gal-T family members from different species [12,14]. These interactions are not compatible with the Glc moiety of UDP-Glc, because the O4 hydroxyl group in Glc is equatorial, making UDP-Glc more than 100-fold less preferred as a sugar donor substrate for b1,4-Gal-T1 [22]. In the vicinity of the O2 hydroxyl group of the Gal moiety, a small hydrophobic pocket, formed by residues Leu255, Met277 and Met344, can partially accommodate C2 hydroxyl group substituents, such as -CH2-CO-CH3 [12]. The sidechain carboxylate group of Asp252, part of the highly conserved DXD motif, interacts with the O2 and O3 hydroxyl groups of the Gal moiety, but does not directly interact with the metal ion [18].
Tyr289 determines the specificity of the enzyme for UDP-Gal

UDP-Gal, and then to participate in the formation of the transition-state complex for catalysis. Met344 with Mn2+, or His344 with Mg2+, performs both of these functions for successful catalysis (see also Update).

In the Mn2+­UDP-Gal-bound enzyme complex, the sidechain hydroxyl of Tyr289, although close to the C2 atom of Gal (the O2 hydroxyl group faces away from the Tyr289 residue), leaves enough space between the C2 atom and the hydroxyl of Tyr289 so that, during catalysis, the Gal moiety moves freely towards the acceptor molecule

(b) Interactions of Tyr289 in b1,4-Gal-T1­UDP-GalNAc­Mn2+. (c) Substitution of Tyr289 by leucine has been modeled in the UDP-GalNAc-bound structure (b). The GlcNAc residue in the binding site has been modeled in (a­c), based on the crystal structure of the b1,4-Gal-T1­a-LA­GlcNAc complex [11]. The N-acetyl group of UDP-GalNAc (b) not only forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr289 (arrow), but also causes steric hindrance, which is absent in both the UDP-Gal-bound structure (a) and the modeled UDP-GalNAc-bound Tyr289Leu mutant structure (c).

(Figure 3a) [23]. In the Mn2+­UDP-GalNAc (N-acetylgalactosamine)-bound enzyme complex, the N-acetyl group of GalNAc occupies this space and its carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl of Tyr289 (Figure 3b). Thus, Tyr289 acts as a molecular brake on the GalNAc moiety and restricts its transfer to the acceptor molecule [23] (see also Update). Substituting Tyr289 with leucine removes this restriction (Figure 3c) and the Tyr289Leu mutant can transfer GalNAc [23] or other Gal C2 analogs [24], not normally substrates of the enzyme, from their respective UDP-derivatives to the GlcNAc acceptor with the same efficiency with which the wildtype enzyme transfers Gal from UDP-Gal. In all b1,4Gal-T family members from different species, the residue corresponding to Tyr289 has been conserved, suggesting that it ensures that UDP-Gal is the sugar donor substrate for these enzymes [23] (see also Update).
Creation of an oligosaccharide-acceptor-binding site

Arg359, Phe360 and Ileu363 (Figure 2a) form a hydrophobic pocket that facilitates the binding of the N-acetyl group of GlcNAc [11,12,13]. Other GlcNAc-binding residues, Phe280 and Tyr286, which are buried in the open conformation of the long loop, are exposed in the closed conformation. Three regions of the protein -- residues 280­289, 319­325 and 359­368 -- form an extended sugar-binding site. Although sequence comparison of the GlcNAc-binding site of b1,4-Gal-T1 reveals little or no variation among family members, the extended oligosaccharide-binding region shows significant variations, indicating that each enzyme may prefer a different GlcNAc-containing oligosaccharide as its preferred sugar acceptor.

a-LA and b1,4-Gal-T interactions

The conformational change of the long loop generates an a helix from the random-coil structure at its C-terminal end, residues 359­365 (Figure 2a,b), becoming part of the extended oligosaccharide-binding site of the enzyme and also part of the binding site for a-LA [11,13]. Residues

It was shown by sedimentation analysis [25] and chemical cross-linking experiments [26] that a-LA and b1,4-Gal-T interact only in the presence of substrates. a-LA was shown to bind to a region of b1,4-Gal-T1 that is in close proximity to the Glc or GlcNAc monosaccharide-binding site [27,28]. The two proteins also crystallize as a complex

only in the presence of either donor or acceptor Glc or GlcNAc substrates [11]. Crystal structures in the presence of either Glc or GlcNAc (Figure 4a) demonstrate that aLA holds the monosaccharide, through a hydrogen bond with the histidine residue at position 32, in the monosaccharide-binding pocket of b1,4-Gal-T1. a-LA residues 104­111, which undergo a helix-loop transition [29], interact as an a helix with b1,4-Gal-T1 residues 359­ 365 (Figure 4b). This region of b1,4-Gal-T1 is also in a helical conformation, created only upon the conformational change in the long loop. Residues Phe31 and His32 from the B-helix of a-LA interact with the monosaccharide, while residues from the C-terminal region of a-LA, Ala106, Met110, Gln117 and Trp118, make extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with b1,4-Gal-T1, including residues Phe280 and Tyr286 [11,13] (Figure 4b). The C-terminal region of a-LA is the most divergent region between a-LA and its homologous protein, c-type lysozyme [7,30], which has no LS activity. Many of these residues of a-LA have been identified by mutational analysis to interact with b1,4Gal-T1 [31]. While a-LA holds Glc in the hydrophobic acceptor-binding pocket, blocking and making extensive interactions with the extended sugar-acceptor-binding pocket of b1,4-Gal-T1, the sidechain of Arg359 in the a-helical region of the closed conformer of b1,4-Gal-T1 reorients to make maximum contact with the Glc molecule (Figure 4c), enhancing 1000-fold the binding affinity for Glc [32]. On the other hand, GlcNAc, either hydrogen bonded to His32 of a-LA or in the absence of a-LA, makes maximum contact in the hydrophobic pocket without readjusting the pocket [11]. a-LA does not interact with the sugar-donor-binding site of b1,4-Gal-T1. It kinetically enhances the transfer of the sugar residue from the less-preferred sugar-nucleotide to a monosaccharide, GlcNAc. By interacting with the extended sugar-binding site of the closed conformer of b1,4-Gal-T1 in the enzyme­sugar-nucleotide complex [23], a-LA stabilizes the complex, thereby facilitating the transfer of the sugar moiety from the less-preferred sugar-nucleotide to a monosaccharide [22].

each member of the b1,4-Gal-T1 subfamily prefers a specific oligosaccharide and shows tissue-specific expression, each can act as a tissue-specific lectin. In the LS complex, a-LA interacts with b1,4-Gal-T1 in the closed conformation, interfering with the binding of an oligosaccharide, while holding Glc in the monosaccharidebinding pocket of the enzyme, which adjusts to make maximum contact with the monosaccharide, thereby increasing its affinity for Glc to make lactose. Synthesis of lactosylceramide from glucosylceramide by a member of the b1,4-Gal-T subfamily will require a mechanism that is similar to that of lactose synthesis by LS. The specificity of b1,4-Gal-T1 for the nucleotide-sugar UDP-Gal is determined by a tyrosine residue in the binding pocket that is highly conserved among family members from different species. This structural information has provided a base from which novel glycosyltransferases, such as GalNAc transferase with high activity, can be designed by mutating the tyrosine residue to leucine. A spontaneous point mutation at the first nucleotide position of the tyrosine codon in b1,4-Gal-T family members will generate GalNAc transferase activity in a cell, resulting in glycan moieties that will have Gal substituted with GalNAc, which could lead to significant effects on normal cellular processes. The re-engineered recombinant glycosyltransferases are making it possible to remodel the oligosaccharide chains of glycoprotein drugs and to synthesize oligosaccharides for vaccine development.

Update
The enzyme kinetic studies with bovine mutant Met344His b1,4-Gal-T1 have shown that, when Mn2+ is used during the catalytic cycle, at the product release phase the mutant enzyme is unable to return to the open conformation to release UDP and Mn2+ [16]. The inability of this mutant to return to open conformation in the presence of UDP and Mn2+ has enabled us to crystallize, for the first time, the mutant enzyme in complex with chitobiose, a disaccharide acceptor, and other oligosaccharides [33]. Conversely, when Mg2+ is used, the mutant returns to the open conformation easily, due to its lower affinity, indicating that the conformational dynamics of the long flexible loop are influenced by metal ion binding. We have determined the crystal structure of the complex of human b1,4-Gal-T1 with Mn2+, UDP-GalNAc (a poor ° sugar-nucleotide donor), Glc (acceptor) and a-LA at 2.0 A resolution. Both the donor and acceptor substrates are clearly observed in the crystal structure. However, the GalNAc moiety of the donor is hydrolyzed from UDP° GalNAc and is found 3.1 A from the P(b) phosphate oxygen atom, displaced towards the acceptor Glc. The anomeric C1 atom of the GalNAc moiety is flat, existing in a 4H3 conformation, an oxocarbenium-ion-like transition state, with only two covalent bonds with the nonwww.sciencedirect.com

Conclusions
A structure-based explanation of 40 years of biochemical studies on b1,4-Gal-T1, its enzyme kinetic mechanism and the modulation of its acceptor specificity by a-LA to synthesize lactose in the lactating mammary gland has been provided. During the catalytic cycle, the enzyme goes through a molecular dance, wherein the two flexible loops, a short and a long one, undergo a large conformational change, from an open to a closed conformation, which shapes the primary metal-ion-binding site, covers the bound nucleotide-sugar and creates the oligosaccharide-binding site. The closed conformation can be induced by either low concentrations of nucleotide-sugar or high concentrations of oligosaccharide acceptor. In the latter case, the enzyme can act as a specific lectin. Given that

hydrogen atoms O5 and C2. The steric hindrance caused by Tyr286, the residue corresponding to bovine Tyr289, acts as a molecular brake on the GalNAc moiety; the hydrolyzed GalNAc is trapped in its oxocarbenium-ion° like state and is placed 2.8 A from the O4 oxygen atom of the Glc molecule, yet to form the product bGalNAc14Glc. The trapped oxocarbenium-ion-like state has confirmed the catalytic mechanism proposed for inverting glycosyltransferases, such as b1,4-Gal-T1 [34]. Tyrosine at position 289 in bovine b1,4-Gal-T1 has been shown to impart donor specificity towards UDPGal and, if the residue is mutated to leucine or isoleucine, high GalNAc transferase activity is generated [23]. In all vertebrates (mammals, frog, fish, birds, etc.) sequenced so far, there is a tyrosine or phenylalanine residue at the corresponding position of their b1,4-GalT homologs. Conversely, there is a leucine or isoleucine at the corresponding position in the b1,4-Gal-T1 homologs of invertebrates and they exhibit broad sugarnucleotide donor specificity, particularly with high GalNAc transferase activity [35,36]. It has also been observed that, in invertebrate N-glycan structures, the content of Gal moiety is very low; in addition, they have very little lactosylceramide-based glycolipids. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that, during evolution, when vertebrates emerged nearly 500 million years ago, a mutation occurred in the b1,4-Gal-T1 homolog, substituting the Ile/Leu residue (corresponding position of bovine Tyr289) by tyrosine, and generated an enzyme that has high b1,4-Gal transferase activity and low GalNAc transferase activity, resulting in vertebrates with N-glycan structures that have high Gal content [37].

The authors investigated the role of the short flexible loop in determining the mobility of the long flexible loop. When the hydrophobic sidechain of Trp314 is absent, as in the Trp314Ala mutant, the long flexible loop seems to prefer the open conformation. However, in the presence of substrates and a-LA, the long flexible loop seems to easily undergo conformational change to the closed conformation, as seen in the wild-type enzyme. 21.
