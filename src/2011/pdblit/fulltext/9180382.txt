We report the solution of the crystal structure of a mutant of the immunoglobulin V, domain of the antibody McPC603, in which the complementarity-determining region 1 segment is replaced with that of a different antibody. The wild-type and mutant crystal structures have been refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 14.9% at a nominal resolution of 1.97 A. A detailed description of the structures is given. Crystal packing results in a dimeric association of domains, in a fashion closely resembling that of an Fv fragment. The comparison of this VL domain with the same domain in the Fab fragment of McPC603 shows that the structure of an immunoglobulin V, domain is largely independent of its mode of association, even in places where the inter-subunit contacts are not conserved between V, and Vn. In all three complementarity-determining regions we observe conformations that would not have been predicted by the canonical structure hypothesis. Significant differences between the VL domain dimer and the Fab fragment in the third complementaritydetermining region show that knowledge of the structure of the dimerization partner and its exact mode of association may be needed to predict the precise conformation of antigenbinding loops.

theoretical (representative examples are: Stanford & Wu, 1981; Snow & Amzel, 1986; Fine et al., 1986; Shenkin et aE., 1987; Bruccoleri et aE., 1988) and comparative efforts (representative examples are: Mainhart et al. 1984; de la Paz et al., 1986; Chothia & Lesk, 1987; Martin et al., 1989; Chothia et al., 1989; Holm et al., 1990). A particularly attractive approach is the "canonical-structure" hypothesis that has been forwarded by Chothia & Lesk (1987). Their comparison of published immunoglobulin structures and sequencesseemsto indicate that the fold of the CDRs critically depends only on the nature of a small number of conserved residues and the length of the loop. Unfortunately, the relative scarcity of high-resolution structural information slows progress in this field, and it is not yet clear whether this canonical-structure approach will be generally applicable for accurate and reliable structural predictions. With the successful functional expression of immunoglobulin domains in Escherichia coli (Skerra & Pliickthun, 1988; reviewed by Pliickthun, 1991), it has become possible to easily obtain sufficient quantities of specific immunoglobulin domains for detailed study. We have previously reported the crystallization and the solution of the crystal structure of the recombinant IC-V~ domain of the phosantibody phorylcholine-binding murine Id McPC603 (Glockshuber et al., 1990). This structure shows a dimeric crystal packing arrangement corresponding to V, dimers previously reported in the literature (Fehlhammer et al., 1975; Epp et aE.. 1975; Colman et al., 1977), resembling the arrangement of V, and V, in the antigen-binding Fv fragment. As the structure of the whole Fab fragment of McPC603 has been published previously (Satow et al., 1986), we can now compare the structure of a V, domain in the context of the homodimer (V,-D) with the structure of the same domain in the heterodimeric association (V,-Fab). Interestingly, none of the three CDRs of this domain participates in interdomain contacts in the homodimer structure. We thus predicted that this system would be particularly useful for the structural study of different hypervariable loops. Indeed, we were able to crystallize a mutant of the McPC603 Vl.7 in which the first CDR sequence (CDRl) was replaced by that of a different phosphorylcholinebinding antibody, MOPC167 (Potter, 1977: Perlmut,ter et aZ., 1984). The mutant domain, named M3, crystallized isomorphously under the same conditions as the wild-type protein. We have now solved the structure using the same model as

described previously (Glockshuber et al., 1990). refined the structural model to a crystallographic Rfactor of 14.9% and used the refined model for a final refinement of the wild-type domain.

determination of the McPC603 V, (subsequently called M603) has been described in detail (Glockshuber e6 al.. 1990). A mutant of this V, fragment, called M3, replaces the CDRl of McPC603 with that of MOPC167 (Table 1). The plasmid encoding the Fv fragment of the mutant M3, constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the synthetic M603 gene, was obtained from J. Stadlmiiller. The first 114 amino acid residues of the light chain, comprising the V, domain, are encoded. The M3 Fv fragment binds phosphorylcholine with a binding constant of 3.5 x IO5 M-l (Stadlmiiller, 1991). Since this is similar to that observed for the Fv fragment, of McPC603 (Skerra & Pliickthun, 1988). the experimental protocol described previously for the purification of M603 could be followed for the preparation of M3. The purified protein c>rystallized from 1.7 M-ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M-acetate. (pH 2 da.ys, and were morphologically indistinguishable from the wild-type.

Thus 12 V, domains. with a combined molecular weight of 1488 kDa, occupy a unit cell of 4.8x IO5 A3. Thr ratio volume/molecular weight is 325 w'/Da and the solvent content is estimated to be 62% (Matthews, 1968). This value is at! the upper end of those observed for protein crystals and it is remarkable that, in spite of the high solvent content, the ctystals are very well ordered and diffract to beyond 1.9 A resolution.

Data collection

A complete, native data set consisting of 96,963 measurements (Rmerge = (~I(I))/ZI = 0.086) for 11,262 unique reflections was collected from a single crystal on a FAST diffractometer (Enraf-Nonius, Delft) using a Rigaku Rotaflex rotating-anode generator. Measurements were made using the MADNES software (Messerschmidt & Pflugrath, 1987). Measurements were corrected for relative scale. temperature factors and absorption (Huber & Kopfmann, 1969; Steigemann, 1974; Messerschmidt ef al., 1990). The R,,, of averaged Friedel pairs was @029. Of the possible reflections to 1.97 A. 91.3 yo were measured (more than 2a above background). The last shell of resolution from 1.99 A to I.97 A was complete to 50%.

Superposition matrices were calculated to minimize the root-meansquare co-ordinate difference (RMSD) for the N, c", C and 0 atoms of these residues. Hydrogen bonds were considered if the donor-H...acceptor distance was less than 2.7 A and the donor-H. .acceptor angle was greater than 145". The co-ordinates of the wild-type V,-D and the M3 mutant have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank and are available directly from the authors on request until they have been processed and released.
(e) Rejnement of M3

M603 has an insertion of 6 residues relative to the Kabat alignment (31a to 31f) and M3 has an insertion of 5 residues (deleting position 31b).
(c) Structure solution

As the crystals were isomorphous to those described previously for the wild-type domain, the structure was readily solved by difference-Fourier techniques using the model phases for the wild-type V, domain.

(d) Nomenclature

and definitions

The numbering of residues throughout this paper is that proposed by Kabat et al. (1987). The correspondence between this numbering and a sequential numbering is given in Table 2. Amino acids from symmetry-related domains will be designated by a #. The numbers denoting position of amino acid residues from the heavy chain are preceded by the letter H. The /?-strands will be designated as described by Marquardt & Deisenhofer (1982), starting with strand A at the N terminus and ending with the C terminal strand H. To describe directions and orientations within a domain, we will consider the dimerization interface of a domain to be the "front", the CDRs to lie on "top" and the N and C terminus to lie on the "left'`-hand side. Structural data for comparisons has been taken from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977) using the following entries: 1RET (V, dimer REI, Epp et al., 1975), 2FB4 (Fab KOL, Marquart et al., 1980), 2FBJ (Fab 5539, Suh et al., 1986), 2HFL (Fab HyHel 5, Sheriff et al., 1987), 2MCG (1 chain dimer MCG, Ely et al., 1989) 2MCP (Fab McPC603, Satow et al., 1986), 2RHE (V, dimer RHE, Furey et al., 1983), 3HFM (Fab HyHel 10, Padlan et al., 1989), 3MCG (A chain dimer MCG, Ely et al., 1989) and 4FAB (Fab 4-420, Herron et al., 1989). All superpositions for structural comparison were done using co-ordinates for the residues

An initial structural model of the M3 protein was based on the co-ordinates of the V, domain from the McPC603 Fab fragment. These were rotated into the orientation found for the wild-type V, domain (Glockshuber et al., 1990) and the mutated loop was built into the difference electron density map calculated from the wild-type and M3 reflection data and the preliminary wild-type V, phases. Refinement was started for this initial model employing the program EREF (energy restrained crystallographic refinement: Jack & Levitt, 1978). Refinement cycles were run until the structure's R-factor had converged, followed by interactive model building on an Evans and Sutherland graphics terminal using the program PROD0 (Jones, 1978). As the refinement progressed to an R-factor below 25%, solvent molecules were placed into regions of the F,- F, difference electron density map which were above 4.1 u of the mean and less than 40 A distance from the protein atoms. Only such solvent molecules that were consistently observed, did not significantly increase their B-values during further refinement and were in stereochemically plausible positions were retained. A strong peak of residual electron density located between 2 symmetryrelated arginine side-chains was interpreted as a sulfate ion. A consistent residual electron density peak at the surface of the protein, containing 4 maxima, was interpreted as an acetate ion. A summary of the refinement process is given in Table 3. Whereas most regions of the protein refined without major rebuilding, the site of the mutation itself, the CDRl, had to be remodelled several times. The electron density of this loop is weaker than that of the rest of the molecule and it was difficult to interpret unambiguously the structure of the main chain. Atoms without defined electron density were not used for calculation of structure factors.

B. Steipe et al. 0.16 A. No residual peaks greater than IO.25 e/A31 were found in the F, - F, maps. The Ramachandran plot for M3 is shown in Figure 1. The majority of residues are found in the antiparallel /?-strand region (4 = - 60" to 150", $ = 100" to 170") (Richardson, 1981) and all residues but five are found within the energy boundaries postulated by Ramachandran et al. (1966). Three exceptions are Ser52 (4 = - 141@,$ = 7 "). His92 (I$ = -135", $ = 14") and Thr69 (4 = -115", $ = 18"), which are located in welldefined electron density and deviate only slightly from the low energy contours. The most conspicuous deviation is seen at Ala51 (I$ = 67 O, $ = -34"), which will be discussed below. Gly3ld (4 = -36", t/G -42") is poorly defined in electron = density (see above). The refined V, domain shows the typical immunoglobulin variable domain structure (Fig. 2). It consists of two b-sheets with four and five antiparallel strands, forming a typical B-barrel. The barrel is closed on the left-hand side by a compact subdomain containing two strands forming the second CDR (Fig. 3). Tt is closed on the right-hand side by the first b-strand, which is divided by the cis-proline Pro8 into a part A, hydrogen bonding in antiparallel fashion to the B b-strand and a part A' bonding in parallel fashion to the H strand. (b) Crystal packing A view of a C' trace of domains in the unit cell. along the 6-fold symmetry axis, clearly shows the symmetry elements of the P6,22 space group (Fig. 4). Each monomer contacts four domains in the crystal lattice. One of these domains forms the V, dimer, which is discussed in more detail below. Corresponding to the relative orientation of domains to each other, these symmetry relationships will be designated syn, anti and meta. These are generated through the following symmetry operations: syn: (X-Y, Y: -Z); anti: (X, X- Y, 6-Z); and meta: (-Y. X-Y. f+Z or -X-l- Y, x-, ++q. The syn-interaction corresponds to the V, dimer (Glockshuber et aZ., 1990). The amino acids Tyr36, Gln38, Pro43, Pro44, Leu46, Tyr49, Glu55, Tyr87. Gln89, Asp91, Tyr94, Pro95, Leu96, Phe98, Gly99 and Ala100 lose more than 100/b of their solvent.accessible surface upon association and thus form the dimer interface. The anti-symmetry partner binds to the V, domain with an antiparallel p-strand from the amino acids Ser7 to Ser14 and Ser # 14 to Ser # 7. As this part of the first B-strand (A') contributes to the front j-sheet of the domain, this P-sheet is extended in the crystal lattice to twice its size, The meta-association is non-symmetric. In this mode of association, the amino acids Lys24, Thr69 and Gly70 at the top of the domain contact Ala# 15, Gly# 16 and Gln# 79 at the bottom of the meta-partner (- Y, X- Y> 4 +Z). Equivalently, at the bottom of the domain Ala15, Clyl6 and Gln79

The final model shows clear electron density for all residues from Asp1 to LyslO7. The side-chain of ArglOS and the last residue, Ala109, are disordered. The solventexposed loop of CDRl gives only poor electron density. Here, Lys3la is almost undefined. The main-chain atoms from N AspSlc to C Gly3ld also show weak electron density. The whole loop seems to be rather flexible, with main chain B-values above 50 A'. Thus the structural model has to be interpreted with some caution in this region. (f) Refinement of the M603 V, domain

A model for the V, domain was constructed by building the CDRl loop between 31 and 31efrom the co-ordinates of the V, domain from the McPC603 Fab fragment superimposed onto the refined M3 co-ordinates. This model immediately refined to an R-factor of 158%. The Rfactor dropped to 149% after a final round of minor modifications. Most solvent molecules refined into identical positions as in the M3 mutant with only minor changes in their B-values.

3. Results (a) The final models The final models for M3 and M603 contains 864 and 866 protein atoms as well as 121 and 123 solvent atoms, respectively. The two structures are practically identical. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) co-ordinate difference for all atoms (excluding solvent and the mutated loop) between M3 and M603 is 606 A. Thus, except where explicitly stated, the following description is valid for both structures. The final R-factor for both models is 14.9% with a standard depiation of bond lengths from ideal values of 9015 A and of bond angles of 2.23". The maximum average co-ordinate error as
calculated from a Luzzati plot (Luzzatti, 1952) is

contact Lys # 24, Thr # 69 and Gly # 70 at the top of the next meta-partner (-X+ Y, -X, s+Z). This top-to-bottom arrangement can be extended in space. The projection of the long axes of metaassociated monomers onto the "a b" plane of the crystal lattice gives an angle of 60". Meta-associated monomers turn around the S-fold screw axis. Thus the crystal lattice can be easily described. A helix of meta-associated monomers turns around a 3fold screw axis. A second helix, with a phase difference of exactly one half turn, associates through the anti-interaction. This double helix now has a period length of the unit cell height. All monomers within this helix point their syn-interfaces radially outward. Finally, these columns aggregate in a hexagonal packing via the syn-interaction to form the crystal lattice. A Oprotein-free tunnel with a radius of about 30 A, parallel to the protein columns, is found in the crystal lattice at sites corresponding to every third position of a hexagonal close packing. All three CDRs point into this tunnel. Additionally, a domain is linked to the metapartner of the anti-domain, (- Y, -X, i-Z), through a double-salt link: two symmetry-equivalent Arg60 residues bind a sulfate ion from the solvent.

the classification of the turns are summarized in Table 4. The four p-11 and p-11' turns observed here, contain glycine in the third position (Venkatachalam, 1968). We find that 9776 of mainchain polar atoms form hydrogen bonds, 54 y. (118) are involved in main chain to main-chain bonds. 12% (26) are to side-chain atoms, the rest are to solvent molecules. All buried polar side-chain atoms make good hydrogen bonds. This implies that the structure is

at a conformational optimum, in the sense that a mutation at any of these sites would increase the conformational energy or necessitate some (local) refolding. The buried polar side-chain atoms are all associated with some distinct conformational feature of the domain, and all are among the most highly conserved amino acid residues in the immunoglobulins. (1) Gln6 hydrogen bonds to the structural wat)er molecule W2 (see below) and to amide nitrogen atoms of GlylOl and Cys88. Thus, it may be important in the formation or stabilization of the b-bulge of Ala100 in strand H. This P-bulge generates the twist in the front B-sheet, which characterizes the immunoglobulin variable domain dimerization (Chothia et al., 1985). Gln6 is almost completely conserved in the V, domains and found to be mutated to Glu in only half of the Vu domains. (2) Oy Ser25 bonds to 0 Gln27 (2.73 A), stabilizing t.he first turn from P-strand B into the CDRl. It is not part of t,he core structure and, indeed, an alanine is found in this position in the structures of REI, 5539, HyHel5 and HyHellO without significant structural consequences. (3) N"' Trp35 bonds t'o the buried solvent Wl (see below). (4) 0" Tyr86 hydrogen bonds to 0 Asp82 (2.61 A), thus aflixing

the 3io-helix, which crosses under the domain, to the core of the structure. Again, this residue is almost completely conserved, and it is significant that a mutation to Phe seemsto be strongly selected against in the immunoglobulin sequence. (There are only 2 Phe residues in this position in all the V, sequences,and all the rest are Tyr.) This hydrogen bond is conserved in all the published immunoglobulin V, structures. (5) Thr97 is the first conserved residue after the CDRS. This position is also frequently taken by a valine and thus the requirements seem to favor a small, p-branched aminqacid. The Oy' Thr97 to 0 He2 hydrogen bond (2.72 A) may stabilize the N terminus of the protein. As can be seen from Figure 2(a) and (b), the first two residues cannot participate in the regular antiparallel P-strand, since strand B turns at the height of these residues to cross over the top of the domain and form the CDRl. In the structures of KOL, MCG and RHE, this hydrogen bond is absent, since Val, Vat and Gly are found, respectively, in position 97. This correlates with an N terminus that is somewhat displaced from the framework in these structures. On the other hand, wherever Thr is found, the N terminus is integrated into the rest of the domain in a manner comparable to the V,-D. (6) Thr102 forms a hydrogen bond to 0 Pro8 (2.78 A) to provide the crucial interaction that breaks the regular main-chain hydrogen-bonding pattern, as the first P-strand makes its transition from A' (antiparallel p-structure) to A' (parallel b-structure). This conformation is conserved in all the published immunoglobulin V, structures. Additionally, the stereochemistry of the polar side-chain atoms buried in the domain core conforms well to the spatial preference regions found by Ippolito et al. (1999) in their recent analysis of side-chain hydrogen bonding in well-refined high resolution protein structures. The hydrogen bond Oq Tyr86 to 0 Asp82 (2.61 A) is found almost perfectly in plane and at a 120" angle, consistent with an sp2-hybridization of the tyrosine hydroxyl group. NE' Trp35 bonds Wl only 4" out of plane and 11.2" out of line. Oy' Thr97 bonds 0 Ile2 13" out of tram and 0)" ThrlO2 bonds 0 Pro8 Ser only 13" out of gauche-. Finally, the salt link between Arg61 and Asp82 also displays ideal stereochemistry (type 1: Singh et al., 1987), 9" out of the guanidinium group plane and 3" out of the carboxylate group plane, with the oxygen atoms approaching the nitrogen atoms N" and N"' at 2.78 and 2.77 A. Again this important interaction is conserved in the other immunoglobulin structures examined. Thus, the conformation of the whole domain seemshighly optimized towards optimal stereochemistry of the conserved buried polar side-chain atoms.

lattice. The second domain can be generated through the symmetry operator (X - Y, - Y. -2) and a translation vector of (A, 2B, C) in the nonorthogonal co-ordinate system of the unit cell. This association is very similar to the V, dimer REI and places the two V, domains in a relative spatial arrangement corresponding closely to the structure of the heterodimeric Fv fragment. A structural superposition of the V, domains of this study and the published McPC603 Fab shows only small differences. The core P-strand region C" atoms of the two structures can bc superimposed with an r.m.s. deviation of @32 A, which is within t,he limits seen for other proteins crystallized under non-identical conditions (Chothia & Lesk, 1986). M603 and RET have only 74:/o amino-acid identity in this region (63% overall). Still, the RMSD of superposition of these two different proteins is the same as that between the V,D and the V,-Fab. 4s the resolution of the Fab fragment is only 3.1 A, the significance of conformational differences between the V,-D and the VtFab is difficult to judge in some cases. The more conspicuous differences are: (1) the side-chain of Leull packs differently in the V,-1): this allows the main chain to be modelled into more favorable stereochemistry. (2) The loop bet,ween Ser14 and Glu17 was rebuilt in the V,-D. the orientation of the Ser14-Ala15 peptide plane was changed by 180" and the rest of the residues moved accordingly. The V,-D conformation corresponds more closely to the conformation seen in other highresolution V, structures. (3) Pro43 and Pro44 move back in the V,-Fab, possibly due to different interface packing interactions. (4) The peptide plane between Gly50 and Ala51 was turned by 180". (5) The conformation of the CDR3 is significantly changed, as discussed in more detail below. In accordance with the observation that residues at the interface between the two domains are highly conserved and their spatial location is preserved among V, and V, domains (Chothia et al., 1985), the structure of the V,-D and the V,-Fab superimposes particularly well in this region. There are no major rotational or translational movements seen. Evolutionary pressure seems to have allowed only very conservative changes from the time V, and V, diverged from a common precursor. It is only in one place, where TrpH103 of V, is replaced by Phe#98 of the V, dimer, that a small cavity would be created. But the interface region in this three-layer packing is sufficiently flexible to fill this space through a slight shift in the side-chain positions of Phe98 and Tyr36 (Fig. 5). A Gln-Gin hydrogen bond within the interface, a structural feature found in all immunoglobulin variable domain dimers, is also seen in V,-D. Gln38 lies at the 2-fold symmetry axis of the dimer and forms two hydrogen bonds of good geometry with Gln#38. We conclude that crystal packing and domain association play only a minor role in the generation of this structure. A comparison of the mode of association of the V,-D and the Fv fragment shows that the V, domain loses 30%) less of its solvent-accessible

values for 0 atoms larger than those for N atoms, were rotated by 180" from their initial orientation taken from the V,-Fab. The solvent-exposed sidechain of Gln27 was modelled better this way, indicating a conformational preference, while Gln79 and Gln89 seem statistically oriented. More significant differences are the hydrogen bonding carboxamide groups of (1) Gln37, which hydrogen bonds with its Ne2 to the lone pair of Oq Tyr86, which in turn hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl group of Asp82, and (2) Asn90, which has a stereochemically implausible conformation in the V,--Fab. (e) The disulfide bridge Epp et al. (1975) have described two alternative conformations of the intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys23 and Cys88 in the REI V, dimer. Here, clearly only a single conformation is seen; it possesses the torsional angles: 170"121" 79" 167"-58" 23 : N-C"-CBSY--SY-CB-C"-C : 88.

Thus it would be considered a right-handed disulfide spiral (Richardson, 1981). The disulfide bond bridges the large C"-C" distance of 6.6 A, typical for immunoglobulin domains. (f) The structural water molecules WI and W2

Two water molecules are found within the V, domains that are not part of the hydration shell, but are integral parts of the domain architecture. These are designated W 1 and W2. Wl is found in a cavity between the CDR2 subdomain and the core of the protein. It makes three hydrogen bonds of near-ideal geometry with the indole nitrogen atom of the conserved core residue Trp35, and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Ala51 and Ser65. This water molecule is found in all K-domain structures solved at sufficient resolution, REI and 5539. Thus, we postulate that this water molecule is a universally conserved structural feature of K-V, domains. W2 is found in a c?vity between the p-strands A, B and H, some 5 A from the protein surface. Again, we find three hydrogen bonds with near-ideal geometry. They connect the water molecule with the buried glutamine carboxamide nitrogen atom, NE2 Gln6, with the carbony atom of Ser22 and with the buried hydroxyl group of Thr102. Interestingly, this water molecule is not found in t,he structure of REI even though all three potential ligands are present. The only local structural difference is a change from methionine (Met21) to isoleucine at the bottom of the cavity that contains this water molecule. The water molecule is present in the structure of 5539, despite an isoleucine in position 21.

surface through association in the V, dimer than in the complex with the Fv fragment. The solventaccessible surface of the V, domain of 5620 A' is reduced to 5050 A' (a difference of 570 A') in the V, dimer, but to 4720 A2 (a difference of 900 A') in the Fv fragment. Carbon atoms contribute 65% of the interface surface. The absence of the extensive interactions that the Vn CDR3 makes with V, in the Fab fragment does not cause significant structural changes in the V, dimer. But a number of specific interactions between the VL domains can be discerned, each of which would be predicted to cause a decreased association energy of the V, dimer as compared to the Fv fragment. (1) Asp91, which hydrogen bonds to AsnH95 of the Vu domain in the Fab fragment, is close to the 2-fold symmetry axis in the VL dimer. Here the side-chain of Asp91 is turned, so that the carboxyl groups of Asp91 and Asp # 91 are 12 A apart. Even so, repulsive interactions of this paired, negatively charged side-chain, close to the 2-fold axis of symmetry, might serve to explain the fact that V, crystallizes only at acidic pH. (2) The carboxyl group of Glu55 is seen to make a close contact to the hydrophobic ring of Pro#95 of the CDR3. This might come in conflict with the hydration shell of the carboxyl group. ,In the Fab fragment, Glu55 is modelled pointing into the solvent. (3) The hydroxyl group of Tyr94 is hydrogen bonded to the carboxyl group of GluH35 in the Fab fragment. This hydrogen bond is absent from the VL dimer and a well-defined solvent molecule is found in place of the carboxyl group. (4) The most conspicuous difference in the association is the absence of the long CDR3 of the Vu domain, which packs against the descending part of the V, CDRl, the C strand in the V, domain. Residue PheHlOOc is absent from the VL dimer. This residue plugs deeply into the interface, in the heterodimer. The top of the interface, which is the bottom of the hydrophobic hapten-binding pocket of the Fv fragment, is formed by a hydrogen bond between Asp91 of VL and AsnH95 of Vu. The absence of this bond and the PheHlOOc side-chain leave a deep cleft in the interface that extends the solvent-accessible surface almost 10 A deep into the interior of the dimer (Fig. 5). Additionally, the hydrogen bond from 0" Tyr36 to N PheHlOOc has no counterpart in the V,--D.

The CDR2 is very well defined and the electron density permits an unambiguous definition of the position of all involved atoms (Fig. 6(a)). It is bridged by four hydrogen bonds. A "classical" y-turn (Rose et al., 1985; class 3 y-turn, Milner-White et al., 1988) is found at the apex of the two b-strands D and X, and Ala51, bracketed by this turn, displays the unusual (4, $) combination of (4 = 66", $ = -35"). This region of the (4, e) map was originally "forbidden" by Ramachandran et al. (1966) but was found to be favorable in more refined calculations which allow some flexibility of atomic bonds (e.g. see Weiner et al., 1984). The conformation around Gly50 and Ala51 is different from the one modelled by Segal et al. (1974) in the VGFab (Fig. 6(b)). But the clearly defined electron density and more favorable stereochemistry in this region prompt us to postulate that the conformation observed here is the correct one. This makes the conformation of the CDR2 uniformly conserved among immunoglobulin V, domains. The main chain continues with two /l-turns (Ser56-Gly57, AspGO-Arg61) after the CDRB. They fold the main chain back onto itself to form one of the most compact subdomains observed so far in proteins (Zehfus & Rose, 1986). This compact subdomain, running from Leu46 to Ser65 wraps around the side-chain of Ile48 and forms a plug, sitting against the hydrophobic core of the protein and closing it off to the side (Fig. 3). Only the N- and Cterminal segments of this subdomain are anchored to the main body of the protein with: (1) a peculiar sequence of double-single-double hydrogen bonds between b-strands COand D (these are: N Leu47 (2.8 A) and N 11~48 (32 A) with OTrp35; 0 Ile48 with N Trp35 (2*g0A); N Gly50 and N Ala51 with 0 Leu33 (both 3.0 A)); (2) the hydrogen bond of 0 Ala51 to the core tryptophan Trp35 via the internal water molecule Wl ; (3) a salt link between Arg61 and Asp82, two residues that are almost universally conserved in the V, domains; and (4), regular antiparallel /3-structure of the strands E and F, beginning at Arg61 (Fig. 2(b)). Thus, the stabilization of this subdomain largely relies on non-covalent interactions with only three residues, Leu33, Trp35 and Asp82, besides van der Waals' interactions. (iii) CDR3 The CDR3 conformation is significantly different from the V,-Fab conformation. Again, the electron density is very well defined and the main chain and side-chains of this region can be unambiguously placed (Fig. 7(a)). The main chain is moved approximately 2 A towards the front and the side-chain of His92 is tilted in the same direction, so that the C" His92 is at a distance of 3.0 A from the V,-Fab conformation. The imidazole group moves by 68 A (Fig. 7(b)). The RMSD of the 44 atoms from Asn90 to Tyr94 is 2.76 A (2.05 A for the 19 backbone atoms). Additionally, the hydrogen bonding topology of this loop changes: Asn90 is found to make

(h) Structure (i) CDRl

of the CDRs

The long, solvent-exposed loop of the M603 CDRl between Asn31 and Lys3le makes few interactions with the main body of the domain. It is thus not surprising that it is found to be partially disordered or flexible with main chain B-values above 50 A'. Although the M3 sequence is one residue shorter, the loop is found to occupy approximately the same region of space as the M603 loop. The M3 loop is found similarly disordered, with the weakest electron density at the first "corner" of the loop (Ser3la in M603 and Lys3la in M3).

These key residues would contain the relevant information to generate a typical "canonical" fold, regardless of the rest of the sequence. By this comparative modelling strategy, it has been possible to predict the conformation of some CDR loops prior to the publication of the experimental structure (Chothia et al.. 1989). If the implied causal relationship between the observed key residues and the threedimensional loop structure was of general significance, this would provide us with an instance of being able to localize essential elements of folding information among the primary structure. Besides, the knowledge of precisely which residues are necessary and sufficient to generate a certain canonical fold, would prove extremely helpful in efforts aimed at predicting antibody structure from sequence data alone, with a view to elucidating molecular inter-

actions with a given hapten or antigen. Indeed, once an antibody structure is precisely known, a docking procedure may provide the correct mode of association with the antigen in favorable cases(Goodsell & Olson, 1990).
How well is the canonical structure hypothesis

supported by the findings of this X-ray crystallographic study? (1) The CDRl, arching across the top of the b-barrel, is found to be pinned into the core of the structure, in a fashion typical for CDRls previously observed, by a conserved hydrophobic amino acid (Leu29 in this case). Leu29 is tightly packed into the core with low B-values and the CDRl loop up to Leu30 is well stabilized. On the other hand, the long solvent-exposed loop, continuing from Asn31 is hardly stabilized at all. It had been necessary to
postulate a separate canonical structure for 4-4-20

residue shorter than McPC603 and has a conformation very different from that of McPC603 (Herron et al., 1989). M3 has the same length of the CDRl as 44-20, but the conformation is found again to be quite different, so that yet another canonical structure should have to be introduced. It is interesting to note that the CDRl B-values of 4-4-20 are much lower than those observed for either M603 or M3. Since the 4-4-20 loop does not seem to have significantly more stabilizing interactions with the

et al., 1989), which is one amino acid

domain scaffold than M603 or M3, other than the approach to 35 A from an arginine residue of a symmetry-related domain in the crystal and a possible participation of His31 in hapten binding, this argues for an important role for internal stabilization of the loop itself. Three hydrogen bonds in 4-4-20 could be important in this context: the first bonds 0 Gln3lb to 0" Tyr32 (which is Phe32 in M3). The other two bridge the back of the

loop with N6' Asn3le (which is Lys3le in M3) to 0 SerSla and 0" Asn3le to N GlySld, in a conformation reminiscent of the stabilization of some CDR3 loops (Fig. 8). In the face of some residual uncertainty about the accuracy of the 4-4-20 model in this region and until experimental data on the relative importance of Tyr32, Asn3le or other residues within the loop for stabilizing this structure are available, we would suggest that the structure of loops inserted between position 30 and 32 should be considered to be unpredictable. (2) In the structure of the CDR2, Chothia & Lesk (1987) had postulated that the variant conformation observed in McPC603 was linked to the presence of a glycine residue (Gly50). Our data on the VL-D structure indicate, however, that the CDR2 conformation is highly conserved among all V, domains, thus unifying the observed canonical structures, and a glycine residue at position 50 does not generate an exception. (3) The canonical structure of this CDR3 has been postulated to be determined by the conserved cisproline Pro95 and two hydrogen bonds from the carboxamide group of Asn90 to the back of the loop (Tramontano et al., 1989). We observe a different topology of hydrogen bonds (which are, in addition, all longer than 3.0 A) from Asn90 in this structure. Thus, we would suggest that the conformational importance of the hydrogen-bond stabilization of this solvent-exposed loop is not yet completely clear. Furthermore, the significant structural differences between the V,-D and the V,-Fab CDR3 indicate that the basic premise of the canonicalstructure hypothesis has to be viewed with some caution. A strong influence of V, (or the second V,) on the conformation of a CDR (possibly mediated in this case through electrostatic effects involving

Asp91) would mean that this conformation would depend both on the precise mode of association between the two domains in the homo- or heterodimer. This would be especially problematic if a CDR conformation would depend on the precise conformation of the Vu CDRS. Both cannot be ruled out and both may be impossible to predict with sufficient accuracy (Stevens et al., 1988; Colman et al., 1987). In conclusion, the potential of the canonicalstructure hypothesis to predict antigen-binding loops from sequence data alone with sufficient accuracy to permit modelling of binding interactions, must still be viewed with some caution, and it becomes clear that much further structural work will be necessary. An attempt to rationalize the structural differences between the M3 and 4-4-20 CDRl illustrates the difficulty of drawing conclusions from the observation of mere sequence-structure correlations, as too little is known about true causal relationships. The conformation of the CDR2 and its lack of correlation with a glycine residue at position 50 illustrates the limitation of such knowledge-based conformational predictions that rest in the accuracy and reliability of. the underlying experimental structures. Finally, the difference in CDR3 conformation between the V,-D and the V,-Fab illustrates the difficulties for conformational predictions in caseswhere the local structure may be significantly influenced by long-range interactions or quarternary structure. The finding that a CDR mutation such as in M3 can have negligible structural consequencesfor the rest of the domain is encouraging for further engineering: experiments to transplant and combine loops of known structure to generate new binding properties and efforts to solve the structure of new
