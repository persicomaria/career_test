for cholesterol and phosphatidylserine, a homolog of PRTF called SDPR (serum deprivation response factor; a phosphatidylserine-binding protein) was also identified in the current screen. What are the implications of the presence of PTRF in caveolae? Knockdown of PTRF by RNA interference leads to a reduction in caveolae density in cultured cells and in zebrafish tissues. Loss of morphologically identifiable caveolae is accompanied by greater mobility of caveolin and its rapid clearance from the cell surface by internalization and degradation in lysosomes. Reduced PTRF in zebrafish leads to defective tissue architecture and a shortening and curving of the notochord and tail. A similar phenotype is also observed when caveolin levels are reduced (Nixon et al., 2007). During notochord development in the fish, caveolin is expressed earlier than PTRF although morphologically distinguishable caveolae appear only after PTRF expression. This observation suggests a role for caveolin outside of caveolae. One possibility is that PTRF could modulate the relative amounts of caveolae-bound caveolin to free caveolin in the plasma membrane. This ratio is likely to influence signaling outcomes from caveolin-associated proteins and to modulate caveolin turnover.

PTRF is a phosphorylated protein (Aboulaich et al., 2004), and its association with caveolae could be regulated by reversible phosphorylation. Pelkmans and Zerial (2005) implicated a serine/ threonine kinase ARAF1 in the regulation of caveolae assembly; knockdown of ARAF1 by RNA interference dissembles caveolae and results in highly mobile caveolin. It is tempting to speculate that kinases such as ARAF1 could regulate the phosphorylation of PTRF and thus control caveolae biogenesis. This could have consequences for the regulation of insulin signaling in adipocytes, as caveolae are known to concentrate insulin receptors along their margins (Foti et al., 2007). Moreover, PTRF is a substrate for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation, and it moves to the cytosol and nucleus after insulin treatment. Characterization of PTRF as a functional component of caveolae has broad implications ranging from caveolae assembly to regulation of signaling via caveolin. Although the precise function of caveolae and a detailed understanding of their biogenesis still elude researchers, piecing together a molecular jigsaw puzzle regarding the assembly and control of caveolae biogenesis is likely to shed new light on this fascinating field.

The long-awaited structure of the effector portion of IRE1, the endoplasmic reticulum stress transducer, is published in this issue of Cell (Lee et al., 2008). This structure provides new insight into the mysterious coupling of kinase and endoribonuclease activities in the oldest, most-conserved branch of the unfolded protein response in eukaryotes.
Eukaryotic cells respond to the threat of protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by activating an unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR reduces synthesis of new proteins to relieve the load on the stressed ER and upregulates genes that promote the ER's capacity to cope with unfolded and misfolded proteins in the long term (Kaufman, 2002;

the activation loop prior to phosphorylation is not known, it is likely that the unphosphorylated loop sterically restricts nucleotide access to the ATPbinding cleft, and that trans-autophosphorylation induces a rearrangement of the loop, granting access to nucleotide. (A structure of unphosphorylated IRE1 would be revealing in this regard.) Indeed, Lee et al. (2008) show that ADP binds only to the phosphorylated form of IRE1 and induces dimerization (albeit weakly). Of course, ATP must be capable of binding in the cleft of unphosphorylated IRE1 for trans-autophosphorylation to commence. Such binding is likely transient, though, and only sufficient for trans-autophosphorylation upon dimerization of the lumenal domains. With these new structural insights, we can now articulate many of the molecular events in IRE1 activation. ER stressinduced dimerization of the lumenal domain positions the cytosolic domains in proximity for trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase activation loop. The reconfiguration of the activation loop upon phosphorylation, together with nucleotide binding, promotes formation of the cytosolic dimer observed in the crystal structure. The dimerized KEN

domains, stabilized via the dimerized kinase domains, are now competent to cleave the substrate mRNA. This study raises interesting questions for future study: Why does the KEN domain need to be a dimer to be functional as an endoribonuclease? The putative catalytic site appears to be complete in each protomer. It is conceivable that dimerization of the KEN domains stabilizes the positioning of active-site residues. Alternatively, substrate mRNA binding may require a composite surface that traverses both protomers. The authors also speculate about how an IRE1 dimer might coordinately cleave the two sites of a single molecule of an mRNA substrate. These possibilities, as well as the basis for sequence-specific mRNA cleavage, might be tested in future work through cocrystallization of IRE1 and a bound RNA substrate. How significant in vivo is the observation that ADP is more effective than ATP in stabilizing the active kinase dimer? It may be that the millimolar concentration of ATP in cells and the substantially lower concentration of ADP levels the playing field. Alternatively, this nucleotide preference could be an important aspect of the regulatory mechanism--that is, it could ensure that IRE1 activation is tran-

sient and dependent on the ADP off-rate, which would keep IRE1 subordinate to ER-lumenal stress signals. Although the IRE1 story has become decidedly clearer, there is undoubtedly more to be learned about this remarkable ancient enzyme.
