ABSTRACT Multiple sequence alignments of the eight glutathione (GSH) transferase homologues encoded in the genome of Escherichia coli were used to define a consensus sequence for the proteins. The consensus sequence was analyzed in the context of the three-dimensional structure of the gst gene product (EGST) obtained from two different crystal forms of the enzyme. The enzyme consists of two domains. The N-terminal region (domain I) has a thioredoxinlike / -fold, while the C-terminal domain (domain II) is all -helical. The majority of the consensus residues (12/17) reside in the N-terminal domain. Fifteen of the 17 residues are involved in hydrophobic core interactions, turns, or electrostatic interactions between the two domains. The results suggest that all of the homologues retain a well-defined group of structural elements both in and between the N-terminal / domain and the C-terminal domain. The conservation of two key residues for the recognition motif for the -glutamyl-portion of GSH indicates that the homologues may interact with GSH or GSH analogues such as glutathionylspermidine or -amino acids. The genome context of two of the homologues forms the basis for a hypothesis that the b2989 and yibF gene products are involved in glutathionylspermidine and selenium biochemistry, respectively.

The principal role of these proteins in mammals is the detoxification of endogenous and xenobiotic electrophiles. However, it is apparent from the recent completion of dozens of microbial genome sequences and the analysis of human and other mammalian genomes that the GSH transferases form an extended superfamily with a variety of protein

functions, most of which have yet to be elucidated.1­3 The GSH transferases form a cluster of orthologous groups, COG0625,4 of which there are eight members encoded in the genome of Escherichia coli. Only two of the eight gene products have defined functional characteristics. The gst gene encodes a genuine GSH transferase5 but its exact biological role is not known. The sspA (stringent starvation protein A) gene in Escherichia coli appears to be structurally related to the GSH transferases but is involved in the down-regulation of RNA polymerase activity under starvation conditions.6 The functions of the other six genes are not known but it is likely that they do not all catalyze GSH-transferase-like reactions. The situation is even more complex in other microorganisms such as Pseudomonas species, which contain as many as fourteen GSH transferase homologues.2 Like SSPA, other members of COG0625 may act as regulatory proteins or perform non-catalytic functions. It has been known for some time that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (EF1 ) contains a GSH transferase domain.7 More recently, it has been observed that chloride intracellular channels (CLICs) in mammals appear to be members of the GSH transferase superfamily.3,8 The crystal structure of CLIC1 reveals that it has an Nterminal domain with a thioredoxin fold and an all helical C-terminal domain similar to other GSH transferase enzymes.9 Clearly, these proteins have recruited the GSH

transferase architecture to support completely different functions. One of the most interesting questions about the biology of GSH transferase superfamily members is the extent to which they are functionally diversified. The extent of functional diversification of the GSH transferase superfamily in biology is not known. As a first step toward elucidating the variety of biochemistry supported by this superfamily, we present an analysis of the sequence similarity of the GSH transferase homologues found in the E. coli genome in the context of the crystal structure of the gst gene product (EGST). The analysis suggests that most of the consensus residues for the homologues are involved in preserving the GSH transferase fold. Two of the conserved residues are involved in binding GSH, a fact that suggests that the homologues may interact with GSH, -amino acids or related compounds. In addition, we propose possible functions of some of the homologues based on the genome context in which they appear. MATERIALS AND METHODS Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of EGST The gst gene was amplified by PCR from E. coli genomic DNA purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) with primers complementary to the 5 - and 3 -ends of the gene. The primers were designed with NdeI and BamHI restriction sites at 5 - and 3 -ends. The NdeI/BamHI restriction fragment of the PCR product was purified and ligated into the pET20 expression vector (Novagen). Expression of the protein was done in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the pET20 expression vector. Typically, a 2-liter culture was grown to an OD600 1.0 at 37°C at which time IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The culture was allowed to grow for an additional 2 to 3 h and the cells harvested by centrifugation. The cells were disrupted by sonication and the enzyme was purified in two steps. The first step involved chromatography on DE-52 (Whatman) ion exchange column equilibrated with 20 mM MOPS/1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT (pH 7.1). The enzyme bound to the resin and was eluted by the 0 to 400 mM gradient of KCl. The enzyme was pooled and dialyzed against 10 mM K2HPO4 (pH 7.0) and applied to a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of K2HPO4 (10 to 400 mM). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT (pH 5.0). Crystals were grown by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion at room temperature (approximately 20°C). Drops initially containing 10 to 12 mg/mL protein and 3 to 5 mM glutathione sulfonate, 0.3% -n-octylglucopyranoside and 7% PEG3000 were equilibrated against wells containing 0.1 M sodium acetate, 14 to 18% PEG 3000 (pH 4.7). Crystals grew in 2 to 5 days. X-Ray Data Collection, Processing, Structure Solution, and Refinement Diffraction data were collected at 145°K with a Rigaku R300 X-ray generator and a RaxisIV image plate. The diffraction data were reduced and processed in DENZO.10

The final data processing statistics are presented in Table I. The initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement with the model of the E. coli protein structure kindly supplied by Nishida and coworkers (PDB file 1A0F). The protein model was then refined first with X-PLOR,11 and then with REFMAC,12 and O13 was used for model building and coordinate adjustment. Residues 32­ 42 and 142­ 144 of the second monomer were not modeled in the structure, as there was insufficient electron density to define a model. The refinement statistics for the final model are given in Table I. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of EGST The structure of the gst gene product exhibits a canonical GSH transferase fold with a N-terminal / -domain that resembles the thioredoxin fold and an all -helical C-terminal domain.5 The structure of EGST in the second crystal form determined in this work is very similar to the originally reported structure.5 Superposition of the C positions for the dimers in each structure gives an rms deviation of 0.56 Å. The rms deviations of C -positions in the individual subunits, A and B, when superimposed separately, are 0.52 and 0.53 Å, respectively. The interactions of the protein with the GSH analogue glutathione sulfonate are identical. The principal difference between the two structures is the absence of clearly defined electron density for residues B32­B42 and B142­B144 in the second subunit of the structure described in this report. These two regions, which involve loops on the surface of the protein, have higher than average B-factors in both structures. This difference between the two structures does not appear to be directly influenced by lattice interac-

tions but probably reflects an inherent conformational heterogeneity. Although there are some significant changes in the conformations of a number of side-chains, the consensus residues discussed below show no appreciable differences. Conserved Residues in the GSH Transferase Homologues A multiple sequence alignment of the eight genes encoding GSH transferase homologues in E. coli was used to generate a consensus sequence of 17 residues as illustrated in Figure 1. The consensus sequence was then analyzed in the context of the structures of EGST from the two different crystal forms (PDB files 1A0F5 and 1N2A, this work). The distribution of conserved residues (Fig. 2) heavily favors (12 of 17 residues) in the N-terminal thioredoxin-like / -domain. Not surprisingly, most of the conserved residues are involved in preserving key elements of the three-dimensional structure. These include hydrophobic core interactions, interactions stabilizing turns, and coulombic interactions between domains. Most notably, six of the consensus residues are involved in the hydrophobic core of the / -motif of domain I as shown in Figure 3. The side chains of L18, P53, L55, I69, Y72, and L73 interact in the packing of helices-1 and -2 against the -sheet of domain I. In addition, P53 is in the cis configuration and is part of a turn leading into -strand-3 of the sheet. One of the consensus residues in domain II also participates in a hydrophobic core. The side-chain of L140 is located at the end of helix-4 where it projects into a small hydrophobic core with W97, V136, I153, L162, L170, and F181. Although these latter residues are not explicitly conserved in the homologues, they are predominantly (46 of 48 residues) hydrophobic in the eight sequences (Fig. 1).

Consensus residues that appear to stabilize turns include the carboxylate of D155, which interacts with the backbone amides of I146 and T152 in the turn between helices-5 and -6 (Fig. 4), and N47 and P48, which form the turn between strands-3 and -4 in domain I. Proline 85 is also part of a turn between the 310-helix and helix-3 near the junction of domains I and II. Complimentary charged residues are also conserved including an ion pair between domains I and II involving E20 and R188. The carboxylate oxygens of E20 are 3.3 Å from the guanidinium group of R188. This coulombic interaction could help align helix-1 and helix-5, which is part of the group of four helices that forms the core of the C-terminal domain. In sequence space, this is a longdistance interaction, which suggests that the homologues are composed of two closely interacting domains that are similar in structure to domains I and II of EGST. Finally, the guanidinium group of R91 in helix-3 of domain II forms another interdomain, coulombic interaction with the carboxylate of D75 in helix-2 of domain I. Although residue 75 is not part of the consensus sequence, in six of the eight homologues it appears as either an asparate or a glutamate. One of the salient features of GSH transferase structure is that the proteins are invariably dimers. Yet only a few of the consensus residues are near the dimer interface in the structure of EGST. These residues include E65 and Y72 at opposite ends of helix-2 and R91 in helix-3. These pairs of helices form the bundle of four helices at the dimer interface. However, the intersubunit contacts contributed by these residues, which include both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, are a minor part of the overall interface. It appears that the consensus residues are selected primarily for their impact on domain and interdomain structure rather than explicit quaternary

Genome Context and Possible Biological Roles of the Homologues With the single exception of the sspA gene product, the biological roles for the GSH transferase homologues in E. coli are not known. Inasmuch as the EGST enzyme catalyzes the addition of GSH to electrophilic substrates, its presumed role is to mitigate chemical stress. However, its actual biological function in the cell has not been demonstrated. Clues to the function of genes can often be derived from their genome context particularly if the genes occur in operons as has been demonstrated by Gerlt and coworkers.14 ­16 None of the GSH transferase homologues in E. coli occur in operons. However, two of the genes, b2989 and yibF, are adjacent to genes of known function that offer hints as to their biological roles. The yibF gene is next to the genes selA and selB that encode proteins responsible for the synthesis of selenocys-

interactions. Therefore, it is unclear from the above analysis if any or all of the homologues share the dimeric structure of EGST. The upshot of the structural analysis is that most of the consensus residues preserve the important conformational aspects of the protomer structure. The one exception is the glutamate-binding motif at the turn between strand-4 and helix-2 in domain I (Fig. 5). This is a highly conserved structural element that is found in all canonical GSH transferases,1 a fact that suggests that many of the E. coli homologues may bind GSH, glutathione analogues, -amino acids, or similar molecules. However, it should be noted that EGST is the only one of the homologues where binding of a ligand has been experimentally demonstrated.

teinyl t-RNA for SeCys-containing proteins in E. coli. Although the location of the yibF gene next to selB may be fortuitous, it may also be a hint that the gene product is involved in Se metabolism and detoxication. It is thought 2 that selenite (SeO3 ) is reduced by glutathione either for detoxification or delivery in biological systems.17­19 Indeed, conjugates of glutathione and Se, such as GS-Se-SG, are found in vivo.20 If and how the yibF gene product is involved in Se mobilization or metabolism remains to be established. The gene b2989 encodes the largest of the GSH transferase homologues in the E. coli genome (Fig. 1). The fact that it is next to the gene encoding glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase suggests that the b2989 gene product may utilize glutathionylspermidine (Gsp) as a substrate or ligand. Gsp synthetase/amidase is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of spermidine to the glycylcarboxyl group of GSH in the forward direction and the hydrolysis of the same amide bond of Gsp in the reverse direction thus controlling the composition of the GSH/Gsp pool.21,22 Glutathionylspermidine synthetase activity is high in late stationary phase of E. coli growth. As a consequence, most of the GSH in the cell is tied up as Gsp in stationary phase.17,23,24 We propose that the b2989 gene product may utilize Gsp as a substrate or act as a regulatory protein in switching the synthetase/amidase activities of the enzyme, perhaps in response to the GSH/Gsp ratio. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of the sequences of GSH transferase homologues encoded in the E. coli genome in the context of the structure of EGST from two different crystal forms indicates that the most highly conserved residues are principally involved in maintaining key structural elements in the proteins. However, the conservation in all the homologues of two residues that are in the glutathione-binding motif and interact with the -carboxyl and -amino of the -glutamyl residue is a good indication that the homologues may bind GSH, or similar ligands such as glutathionylspermidine or -amino acids.
