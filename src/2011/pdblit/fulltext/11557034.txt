Abstract Serpins are a family of structurally homologous proteins having metastable native structures. As a result, a serpin variant destabilized by mutation(s) has a tendency to undergo conformational changes leading to inactive forms, e.g., the latent form and polymer. Serpin polymers are involved in a number of conformational diseases. Although several models for polymer structure have been proposed, the actual structure remains unknown. Here, we provide a comprehensive list of serpins, both free and in complexes, deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Our discussion focuses on structures that potentially can contribute to a better understanding of polymer structure. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Serpins are a super family of homologous proteins with approximately 800 members identified to date. The vast majority of members of this family are serine protease inhibitors from which the family name derives. However, inhibitors of cysteine proteases and some non-inhibitory proteins are also included due to their structural homology. Serpins play important roles in a variety of processes, e.g., coagulation, inflammation, fibrinolysis, apoptosis, neoplasia, viral pathogenesis, protein folding, and complement activation [1,2]. Certain mutations in serpins lead to conformational diseases recently referred to as serpinopathies [3,4] that are associated with conditions such as angioedema (C1-esterase inhibitor, C1-INH),1 thrombosis (antithrombin, AT), emphysema (a1-proteinase inhibitor, a1-PI; a1-antichymotrypsin, ACT), liver disease (a1-PI, ACT) and dementia (neuroserpin).

destabilizing mutations have a tendency to polymerize, and such polymers are found in cells and body fluids. For example, polymers formed from a1-PI variants accumulate in hepatocytes and are also found in plasma and lungs [5,6], ACT variants are reported to form hepatocyte inclusions [7], neuroserpin polymers form inclusions within cortical and subcortical neurons [8­10], and polymers of C1-INH have been detected in plasma [11]. Serpins have a tendency to polymerize due to their metastable structure [12], which appears to optimize their inhibitory activity. In its normal active form, a serpin appears to be trapped as a high energy folding intermediate with the reactive center loop (RCL) exposed on the surface to facilitate the attack of the active site of a target protease. Loop ``tightness'' appears to contribute to stress within the molecule. Upon cleavage of the RCL by the target protease, the N-terminal portion of the loop (with the covalently trapped protease) rapidly shifts and inserts between the central strands of the A b-sheet located on the surface of the serpin. The rearrangement results in a stable conformation of the cleaved serpin, whereas the structure of the protease becomes destabilized [13]. The metastability of the native structure of a serpin and its readiness to undergo such a rearrangement results from inherent strain within the structure. A variant having its structure destabilized

by a mutation may be prone to changes in conformation even without cleavage of the RCL, e.g., formation of the inserted (or latent) form or polymer, both of which show no inhibitory activity. A few serpins (with no mutations) spontaneously undergo a conformational change from the normal to latent form under physiological conditions. Diverse aspects of the structure and function of serpins including the mechanism of polymerization have been studied by a number of laboratories. Nevertheless, although an immense body of data exists (for other recent reviews see [12,14]), the structures of polymers formed in vivo are yet to be established. Several models of polymer structure have been proposed; however, none of the models, including the most widely accepted loop-A sheet model, has been demonstrated to be physiologically relevant. In this review, we analyze existing crystal structure and peptide binding data in search of clues to polymer structure and discuss the deficiencies of the current models. The structure of serpin polymers and the mechanism of serpin polymerization have been studied by a variety of techniques, e.g., electron microscopy (EM), crystallography, fluorescence, and circular dichroism. The EM data show that serpin polymers formed in vivo and in vitro are linear and have the appearance of beads on a string [8,15­18] except for protein inhibitor-9 (PI-9), which forms aggregates in vitro morphologically distinct from polymers previously observed for other serpins [19]. The major observations that led to the proposed models and major weaknesses of the models are summarized in Table 1. Since the first crystal structures of serpins were determined, i.e., those of cleaved a1-PI (1984) [29], plakalbumin, i.e., cleaved OVA (1990) [30], native OVA (1990) [31], cleaved ACT (1991) [32], and latent PAI-1 (1992) [33], a number of other serpin structures including those of other native serpins, serpin complexes with peptides and with proteases, and a polymer formed from a cleaved serpin have been solved. The structure of the polymer formed from an intact (uncleaved) serpin is lacking. Our PDB

search for serpin structures resulted in the list provided in Table 2. A consideration of these data may provide new insights into possible interactions within serpin polymers. Crystal structures of serpins Native conformation (metastable) Members of the serpin family share a characteristic three-dimensional structure consisting of three b-sheets (A, B, and C), nine a-helices, and the RCL, which is exposed on the surface (Fig. 1). The loop can be shifted from its native position and inserted between central strands of the A b-sheet (strands s3A and s5A). Since this inserted (latent) conformation is more stable than the native conformation, the latter is considered to be a folding intermediate. The metastability of the native form is attributed to the strain resulting from non-ideal interactions within the structure, which include the presence of buried polar groups, cavities in the hydrophobic core, over-packing of the side chains, and the presence of hydrophobic pockets on the surface [34­37]. The length of the loop also plays a major role in serpin stability. Slight extension of the loop has been found to increase a1-PI stability, and its extension by 30 amino acids has been shown to provide stability comparable to that of the cleaved form, which is a relaxed conformation [38,39]. Mutations in the mobile structural elements (proximal hinge, breach, shutter, and F-helix) as well as mutations in the B/C barrel (Fig. 1), which stabilizes the position of the loop in the native conformation, further destabilize the metastable structure and lead to the formation of the latent form and/or polymer [12]. The presence of carbohydrate on the surface of secretory serpins restricts surface accessibility. In the case of a1-PI, oligosaccharides are N-linked through aspargines N46, N83, and N247, and thus the best access appears to be to the surfaces containing the C and A b-sheets, i.e., the surfaces that play the major role during protease binding and

the mutations leading to formation of the latent form and/ or polymer [12] suggest that some differences in the pathways leading to these forms may exist. Mutations in the shutter, F-helix, and/or B/C barrel regions lead to formation of both the latent form and polymer. In contrast, mutations in the proximal hinge and/or breach regions appear to lead only to polymer formation; thus, these particular mutations may hinder partial insertion of the RCL into the A b-sheet thereby favoring the formation of polymer. Therefore, the pathway to the latent and polymer forms appears to fork prior to partial insertion of the loop into the A b-sheet with partial insertion of the loop possibly favoring formation of the latent form. Latent and cleaved conformations (stable) PAI-1 and AT spontaneously undergo the transition to the latent form. The inserted state is termed ``latent'' because serpin inhibitory activity can be regained through denaturation and renaturation [41]. The native conformation of PAI-1 has a very short half-life (<2 h) [42,43] while conversion of AT to the latent form is much slower [44]. Thus, initially, spontaneous formation of the latent form of AT was observed only during crystallization [21,45]. Other serpins can also give rise to the latent form in vivo or in vitro, e.g., latent ACT detected in the lungs of patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema [46] and latent a1-PI formed by treatment of native a1-PI with citrate [47], respectively. Formation of the latent form provides evidence for the metastable nature of the normal form and the ability of the A b-sheet to accept the RCL. The latter has also been demonstrated by numerous structures of cleaved serpins having the N-terminal portion of the RCL inserted between the central strands of the A b-sheet and also by numerous reports of such insertion of peptides having sequences homologous with those of serpin RCLs. Interestingly, since the end of the RCL forms an s1C strand in the normal form, relocation of the intact loop during formation of the latent form results in the loss of this strand of the C b-sheet, which can be complemented by the RCL from another normal molecule. Such an interaction is observed in a number of AT crystal structures and has given rise to the loop-C sheet model of polymer [21]. Complexes with peptides (stability dependent on region of insertion) The inhibition of proteases by serpins requires the insertion of the first 14 residues of the cleaved RCL between strands s3A and s5A. Peptides having sequences corresponding to that of the RCL have also been shown to insert between strands s3A and s5A, and such interactions may prevent polymerization of a serpin. The inhibition of polymerization appears to require the binding of a peptide to the site (or part of the site) that normally accommodates residues P7-P3 since the binding of peptide P14-P3 or

inhibition. These two surfaces have also been proposed to be involved in polymer formation in all the current models for serpin polymer. Therefore, mapping the attachment sites of oligosaccharides in serpins is necessary for establishing the accessibility of the serpin surface. Delta conformation (polymerogenic) An interesting and unique conformation of an intact serpin is the structure of the d conformer (PDB: 1QMN) of a naturally occurring ACT variant (L55P), in which two fragments of the polypeptide chain are inserted into the A b-sheet between strands s3A and s5A with one fragment at each end [40]. One of the fragments is a small portion of the RCL which inserts from the proximal hinge side into the A b-sheet, and the other is the last turn of the F-helix and the loop that links the helix to the s3A strand and that resides in the normal structure of the serpin on the top of the A b-sheet. This conformer has been considered to be an intermediate trapped between the normal conformation and the latent or polymer form. Interestingly, this ACT variant in the d conformation was inactive as an inhibitor, was nonspecifically degraded by bovine a-chymotrypsin, and polymerized more easily at 41 °C even though it appeared to be more thermally stable than the native conformation of the variant. Also, interestingly, binding the RCL peptide P14-P32 to this conformation was substantially slower than to the wild-type protein (t1/2: $4 days vs. 6 h, respectively). The observation that insertion of the RCL peptide into the d conformer was slow, while polymerization was relatively rapid, suggests that loop insertion may not occur during polymerization of the d conformer. The d conformer has been considered to be (or to resemble) an intermediate between the normal serpin conformation and the latent or polymer form. However, locations of
2 The numbering scheme of residues in an RCL peptide, e.g., P14-P1, is such that P1 refers to the RCL residue immediately prior to the peptide bond cleaved by the target protease (residue i); P2 corresponds to residue i-1, P3 corresponds to residue i-2, etc.

peptide P7-P2 to AT resulted in inhibition of polymerization [15,23,25­28]. In contrast, the binding of peptide P14-P8/9 to AT promoted polymerization [25]. Furthermore, polymerization of AT promoted by bound peptide P14-P8/9 was blocked by the binding of a second peptide (i.e., WMDF or other short peptides, unrelated or related to the serpin RCL sequence) to the site that accommodates peptide P7-P4 [27]. However, in the d conformer of the ACT L55P variant, the loop sequence immediately following the F-helix is inserted into the same position that accepts short peptides that block polymerization, but the d conformer is polymerogenic [40]. Thus, insertion of an extraneous peptide or the RCL into the binding site for peptide P7-P4 appears to result in prevention of polymerization, which may relate to prevention of insertion of the loop sequence immediately following the F-helix. Peptide binding appears not to be very specific. For example, peptide P14-P3 from AT is a better blocking agent of a1-PI polymerization than its own corresponding peptide and peptide P14-P10 from PAI-1 binds to two sites on PAI-1, its normal binding site as well as that normally occupied by peptide P6-P2 [48]. The effect of peptide interaction with a serpin appears to result from stabilization or destabilization of the protein structure, depending on the peptide sequence and length, thereby inhibiting or promoting polymerization, respectively. Loop-C sheet interactions The loop-C sheet model of serpin polymerization was proposed based on the observation that normal AT crystallized giving two interacting conformations, latent and normal, such that a portion of the RCL of the normal form accommodates the s1C strand vacancy in the latent form [21]. Around the same time, a similar interaction was observed upon crystallization of a normal (uncleaved) AT, which resulted in crystals containing normal and cleaved forms [45]; subsequently, several analogous (normal + latent) structures have been published. In addition, crystallographic structures of AT complexed with peptides preventing polymerization in solution (PDB: 1JVQ, 1LK6, and 1R1L) showed the same type of loop-C sheet interaction between the peptide-AT complex and the latent form of AT. Since binding short peptides at the P7/6-P4 site prevented polymerization of the AT-P14-P8/9 complex [27], the presence of the loop-C sheet interaction in the crystal is surprising and raises the possibility that this interaction may be a crystallographic artifact rather than a true interaction in solution. Although we are not aware of crystallographic data showing any other serpin participating in a loop-C sheet interaction, other serpins have been proposed to form polymers, naturally or in the presence of citrate, involving this interaction based on conclusions gleaned from fluorescence data and morphology observed by EM [17,47,49].

Strand 7A polymer The strand 7A model was proposed based on the crystal structure of PAI-1 [22] in which the RCL of one PAI-1 molecule formed an additional (seventh) strand in the A b-sheet of another molecule. The s7A interaction appears to have been observed only for this serpin. Head-to-head dimer Recently, we proposed a novel model of serpin polymer structure [18] based on the observation that disulfide-linked dimer of a1-PI forms linear polymers when incubated under physiological conditions. The model proposes that within the polymer each monomer is involved in a head-to-head (disulfide-linked) interaction with an adjacent monomer as well as a tail-to-tail (non-covalent) interaction with another adjacent monomer. Since serpin polymerization does not require formation of disulfide bonds, we hypothesized that the arrangement of monomers within a polymer not involving disulfide linkage is essentially the same as that in the presence of disulfide linkage. To date direct experimental evidence is lacking to support this model when disulfide linkage is absent. Nevertheless, we found that the crystal structure of HCII (PDB: 1JMJ) reflects a structure proposed by us. a1-PI has a single cysteine, C232, partially surface-exposed and located in the edge strand of the B b-sheet very close to strand s1C. When an a1-PI dimer is formed, the head-to-head disulfidelinked monomers may have a cis-, trans-, or any intermediate configuration resulting from rotation around the disulfide bond. The HCII (PDB: 1JMJ) structure represents a cis-head-to-head dimer with the absence of disulfide linkage. In the HCII dimer, the C b-sheet of one monomer extends the C b-sheet of the other monomer, in such a way that the s1C strands are next to each other and are oriented in an anti-parallel fashion thereby giving rise to an extended C b-sheet comprised of six strands. Interestingly, the authors of this structure claim that the most stable interaction within the crystal is ``this antiparallel b-sheet interaction between strands 1 of sheet C'' [50]. In addition, they point out that the stability for such an interface has been also demonstrated for AT and PAI-1 and refer to [21,51] and [22,52], respectively. Summary Serpins have a tendency to polymerize due to instability of their normal native conformation. Destabilizing mutations or slightly denaturing conditions promote conformational changes that result in formation of polymer or, more rarely, the latent form. Accumulation of destabilizing mutations in certain regions of the protein indicates that these regions play an important role related to the integrity and stability of the metastable form. Mutations in the proximal hinge and the breach regions appear to lead only

to polymerization, thereby suggesting a possible initial common pathway of conformational change that diverges just prior to the insertion of the RCL into the A b-sheet of the same molecule. Current data appear not to provide definitive evidence for the role of the RCL in monomer-monomer interactions within the polymer chain. Interactions of the RCL with b-sheets (i.e., the C b-sheet of another monomer, as a seventh strand in the A b-sheet of a neighboring monomer, or between s1C strands in two monomers oriented head-to-head) have been observed by crystallography; however the physiological relevance of these data is unclear. Additional data are needed to support any of the model of serpin polymer. Acknowledgment We dedicate this review to Ann Ginsburg to honor her as a scientist, mentor, and friend. References
