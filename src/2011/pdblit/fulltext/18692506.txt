Abstract Anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab2) 3H6 is directed against the human monoclonal antibody 2F5, which is one of a few neutralising antibodies against HIV-1. Since the binding epitope of 2F5 is cryptic and no neutralising immune response could be elicited by several potential vaccines comprising this region, Ab2/3H6 represents a potent vaccine candidate for active immunisation. Here we describe the molecular features of Ab2/3H6 after changing the antigen binding specificity by single point mutations in the complementarity-determining region 3 of the Ab2/3H6 heavy chain. The resulting Ab2/3H6 mutants were compared in several experimental settings to the wild type Ab2/3H6 Fab fragment. Moreover, we report about an immunisation study with Ab2/3H6 Fab variants, which elicited a specific 2F5-like humoral immune response in BALB/c mice. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Human monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2F5 (Trkola et al., 1995), is one of a few broadly neutralising antibodies identified so far that bind to a relatively conserved membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 (Muster et al., 1993; Purtscher et al., 1994; Zwick et al., 2001). This region includes the linear sequence ELDKWA, with the core residues, DKW being critical for 2F5 binding (Menendez et al., 2004). Although MPER was suggested to be a highly promising vaccine target (Zwick et al., 2001) all attempts to elicit antibodies with the specificity and neutralising activity similar to mAb 2F5 have failed repeatedly (Eckhart et al., 1996; Liang et al., 1999; Coeffier et al., 2000). Furthermore, the implementation of larger peptide epitopes based on the gp41

sequence, as well as peptides bearing novel structural constraints that optimise antigenicity remained unsuccessful (Joyce et al., 2002; McGaughey et al., 2003). These results have clearly indicated that (1) the 2F5 epitope is not entirely represented by the ELDKWA fragment and extensions thereof, and (2) the neutralising epitope is not immunodominant (Menendez et al., 2004). Another difficulty is represented by the unusual structure of 2F5, which includes 30 somatic mutations and a very long, 22 amino acids H3 loop (Kunert et al., 1998). Thus, 2F5-like antibodies are certainly complicated to elicit by conventional immunisation strategies. Even though reactivity against ELDKWA-containing peptides has been consistently observed in serum of HIV-1 infected individuals (Calarota et al., 1996; Geffin et al., 1998), antibodies functionally similar to mAb 2F5 are rarely produced in natural infections (Muster et al., 1994; Mascola et al., 1997). Previously we developed a murine anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab2) 3H6, directed against the antigen binding site of mAb 2F5, which was capable of inducing a neutralising immune response with 2F5-specificity in mice (Kunert et al., 2002). Ab2/3H6 was further chimerised and recombinantly expressed as whole IgG or Fab fragment in chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or

Pichia pastoris cells (Gach et al., 2007). In the present study we explored the use of these chimeric Ab2/3H6 Fab fragments to induce a 2F5-like immune response in mice. Additionally, we attempted to identify the key structural features of the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of the Ab2/3H6 heavy chain required for 2F5 binding by introducing proline/tyrosine to alanine mutations. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Animals Female BALB/c mice (8≠10 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld; Germany). 2.2. Antibodies and antibody fragments Native Ab2/3H6 Fab preparations from P. pastoris cells were expressed as previously described by Gach et al. (2007). In brief, the native and the mutated heavy chain (HC) sequences were individually cloned into a modified version of a P. pastoris shuttle vector (pPICZ A, Invitrogen) containing a PmeI/KspAI replacement in the promoter (Gasser et al., 2006) whereas the light chain sequence was inserted into the original pPICZ A vector. The plasmids combining the expression cassettes for both chains on one vector were generated by double digestion of the heavy chain vector with BglII and BamHI, followed by subsequent insertion of this fragment into the unique BamHI site of the light chain vector resulting in the mutated 3H6 Fab expression vectors. The human Fab standard was obtained from Rockland (USA). Antibody conjugates were purchased from Sigma≠Aldrich (Germany). Monoclonal antibody 2F5 (Polymun Scientific, Vienna) and biotin-conjugated 2F5 were produced and labelled in-house. 2.3. 3D-modelling of mutated Ab2/3H6 CDR-H regions 3D-model of the wild type Ab2/3H6 CDR-H3 and mutated CDR-H3s were established by submitting the corresponding amino acid sequences (variable heavy chain, GenBank accession no. EF512553 and variable light chain GenBank accession no. EF512554) to Web Antibody Modelling (WAM: University of Bath, Swindon, United Kingdom; http://antibody.bath.ac.uk/). The received structures of the wild

type and mutated Ab2/3H6 antigen-binding regions were further analysed with DeepView-Swiss-PdbViewer (Guex and Peitsch, 1997; http://www.expasy.org/spdbv/) for the CDR-H3 binding domain. The CDR-H3 was defined with IMGT delimitations throughout this work. 2.4. Construction, expression and quantification of Ab2/3H6 Fab mutants Various alanine substitutions were introduced in the CDR-H3 of Ab2/3H6 Fab mutants (Table 1) by amplifying the heavy chain in fragments (5 fragment and 3 fragment) with mutated sense and anti-sense primers. Tables 2 and 3 show the primers used for mutagenesis and combinations of oligos for fragment amplification. The isolated PCR products were joined by an overlap extension PCR amplified with the corresponding outer primers HC sense and HC anti-sense. Finally, the mutated heavy chains were cloned into the P. pastoris Ab2/3H6 light chain vector described elsewhere (Gach et al., 2007). All resulting constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The final plasmids were subsequently linearised and introduced into P. pastoris wild type strain X33 cells by electroporation as described by Gasser et al. (2006). Positively transformed clones were selected with the addition of 100 g/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). All of the randomly selected clones were of the methanol utilisation positive (mut+) phenotype. The Ab2/3H6 Fab mutants were expressed in small scale as described by

2.7. Specificity ELISA Crude as well as purified serum samples of the Ab2/3H6 Fab immunised mice were screened for 2F5-like antibodies binding to the synthetic epitope ELDKWA and recombinantly expressed HIV-1 surface antigen, gp160. The standard, human monoclonal antibody 2F5 was serially diluted starting with 100 ng/ml. Finally, binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase labelled gah- chain or gam- chain antibody, respectively. 2.8. Competition ELISA The competition ELISA was carried out as described by Kunert et al. (2000). Briefly, the synthetic peptide ELDKWA was coated onto MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Denmark). Purified serum samples or Ab2/3H6 mutants were serially diluted and mixed with a constant amount of biotinylated mAb 2F5 (mAb2F5-B; 50 ng/ml). The 1:1 mixture and the serially diluted standard (mAb2F5-B; 50 ng/ml) were directly transferred onto the pre-coated plates and incubated for 1 h followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase labelled Streptavidin conjugate (Roche). Apparent affinities of the Ab2/3H6 Fab mutants were calculated as the antibody concentration at half-maximal binding. The apparent affinities as a percentage related to the wild-type Ab2/3H6 Fab were calculated with the formula [(apparent affinity of the mutant)/(apparent affinity of the wild type)] ◊ 100. 2.9. In vitro competition assay The anti-idiotypic binding properties of Ab2/3H6 Fab mutants were determined in vitro by inhibition of syncytia formation of TCLA HIV-1 isolate RF. Serially diluted Ab2/3H6 samples (starting concentration 100 g/ml) were mixed with a constant amount of 2F5 (10 g/ml). This mixture was preincubated with 102 to 103 TCID50/ml virus before addition of AA2 cells. Syncytia formation was examined and evaluated after 5 days of incubation as described by Purtscher et al. (1994). The cut-off concentration was defined as the lowest concentration at which all four parallels of the serial dilution showed syncytia growth. 2.10. Induction and purification of (anti≠anti-idiotypic) Ab3 antibodies Different Ab2/3H6 Fab preparations were used for the immunisation of BALB/c mice. The Ab2/3H6 Fab was expressed in CHO and P. pastoris cells. After anion-exchange chromatography Fab-containing fractions were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography, resulting in aglycosylated and glycosylated Ab2/3H6 Fab isoforms. Groups of five BALB/c mice were immunised intraperitoneally with 15 g of purified Ab2/3H6 Fab preparations emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted three times with the same Fab preparations in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 3-week intervals. Crude sera were collected 4 days after the fourth immunisation, and tested by ELISA for total IgG titers and Ab3 specificity. Sera

Gach et al. (2007): In brief, 10 different clones per construct were inoculated in BMGY medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.0, 1.34% YNB, 4 ◊ 10-5 % biotin, 1% glycerol and 100 g/ml Zeocin) using a single colony followed by an incubation step over night (o/n) at 28  C under vigorous shaking. The o/n culture was used for inoculation of 7 ml BMMY induction medium (BMGY with 0.1% methanol instead of glycerol) with an OD600 of 1.0. At this stage 5% methanol was continuously added in time intervals of 12 h to a final concentration of 0.1%. After 96 h the supernatants were harvested and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Native and mutated Ab2/3H6 Fab fragments were further quantified by double sandwich ELISA. Polyclonal goat anti-human Fab specific antiserum (gah-Fab) was coated onto MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Denmark). Human Fab fragment was used as standard protein in an eight-fold serial dilution starting with 200 ng/ml. Fifty microlitres per well of standard or serially diluted samples were allowed to bind to the precoated well for 1 h prior to detection with horseradish peroxidase labelled gah-Fab. Finally, the OD was measured at 492 nm (reference wavelength 620 nm). 2.5. Ab2/3H6 Fab expression in CHO cells For the expression of Ab2/3H6 Fab fragments the Ab2/3H6 vHCH1 was PCR amplified and ligated into a NotI and BamHI linearised eukaryotic expression vector containing a SV40 early promoter resulting in p3H6vHCH1. The Ab2/3H6 light chain was cloned on its own into a NotI opened and Klenow I refilled linearised pIRESdhfr vector. Dihydrofolate reductase deficient CHO cells were co-transfected with p3H6vHCH1 and pIRESdhfr-3H6LC resulting in a recombinant CHO cell line CHO-3H6Fab. After selection and subcloning in presence of methotrexate (MTX), cells were adapted to protein-free cultivation conditions in DMEM/HAM'sF-12 (1:1) supplemented with 4 mM l-glutamine, an in-house developed protein-free supplement (proprietary formulation), soy peptone, Pluronic F68, and 1.6 M MTX. 2.6. Mouse IgG ELISA Total IgG titers of the Ab2/3H6 immunised mice were quantified by mouse IgG ELISA. MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Denmark) were coated with goat anti mouse- chain antiserum (gam- ) and serially diluted serum samples or standard mouse mAb (starting with 200 ng/ml) was added. After 1 h the bound IgGs were detected with horseradish peroxidase labelled gam- .

with a clear binding towards the synthetic epitope of 2F5 were pooled within the groups. Pooled sera were diluted 1:3 in 0.75 M Na2 SO4 and purified using protein A and protein G sepharose beads (GE-Healthcare; 1:1 mixture). After 1 h the beads were washed twice and bound murine IgG was eluted once with elution buffer 1 (0.1 M Glycine, pH 3.5) and twice with elution buffer 2 (0.1 M Glycine, pH 2.5). Finally, the eluted fractions were adjusted to pH 7.0 and analysed by ELISA experiments. 3. Results 3.1. Generation and characterisation of Ab2/3H6 Fab mutants To learn more about the anti-idiotypic antibody Ab2/3H6 we compared the binding properties of Ab2/3H6 mutants expressed as Fab fragments in the culture supernatant of yeast cultures with the wild type Ab2/3H6 Fab expressed in P. pastoris. Table 1 shows four mutants (Y111A, P113A, P116A and Y117A) and their changes in comparison with the Ab2/3H6. Two putative contact residues (tyrosine111≠Y111A and tyrosine117≠Y117A) as well as two CDR-H3-stabilising residues (proline113≠P113A and proline116≠P116A) were substituted by alanine (Table 1) and best producing recombinant yeast clones were used for production of Fab fragments. Western blot analysis of crude P. pastoris expression supernatants of the Ab2/3H6 Fab mutants indicate that all mutants are detected by anti-human Fab and show electrophoretic properties similar to the wild type Ab2/3H6 Fab (Fig. 1). Following, apparent affinities relative to wild type Ab2/3H6 Fab (setpoint 100%) were measured by competition ELISA. All mutants were tested in three independent experiments and the mean value as well as the standard deviation was calculated. None of the four Ab2/3H6 Fab mutants showed improved binding to 2F5 (Fig. 2), and Ab2/3H6 Fab Y111A completely lost the binding capacity to 2F5. The relative apparent affinity of the

Error bars indicate the standard deviation of three independent experiments. A Student's t-test was applied to determine which mutants show significantly different affinities compared to the wild type. The p-values are as follows: Y111A (p = 6.5469E-05), P113A (p = 0.0131577), P116A (p = 0.278415), Y117A (p = 0.0129486), which means that Y111A is significantly different from the wild type on a 95% confidence interval.

other Fab mutants varied from 71.3% to 91.3%. The impact of the Ab2/3H6 Fab mutants on the HIV-neutralising capacity of 2F5 was further tested in an in vitro competition assay (Fig. 3). The results of the ELISA competition experiments were reflected in the 2F5 neutralising assay. Again, Ab2/3H6 Fab Y111A was not able to inhibit the neutralisation potency of 2F5. The crude yeast expression supernatant of the wild type Fab was able to extinguish the neutralization capacity of 2F5 (10 g/ml) at a concentration of 3.1 g/ml, whereas the in vitro inhibition potential of mutated Ab2/3H6 Fab fragments ranged from 12.5 g/ml (Ab2/3H6 Fab P116A) to 25 g/ml (Ab2/3H6 Fab P113A and Ab2/3H6 Fab Y117A). No inhibition was obtained with Ab2/3H6 Fab Y111A and an irrelevant human Fab even up to 100 g/ml. To address the question whether our replacement mutations in the CDR-H3 minimize the

The syncytia inhibition assay was performed in quadruplicates. The negative control was not able to inhibit 2F5 at a concentration of up to 100 g/ml (data not shown).

side chain without altering the main chain conformation, homology modelled variable regions of the wild type Ab2/3H6 and the mutated Ab2/3H6 variants were analysed by DeepView-SwissPdbViewer (Fig. 4). The CDR-H3s of the investigated variants were highlighted either in red (wild type Ab2/3H6) or in blue (mutated Ab2/3H6). Additionally, the chemical structure of the mutated side chains (tyrosine, proline and alanine) is indicated in Fig. 4. Each mutant CDR-H3 was compared to the wild type. The root-mean-square (RMS) deviation describes the predictabil∞ ity of the model ranging from 0.80 A (Ab2/3H6 Fab P116A) ∞ (Ab2/3H6 Fab Y111A). Ab2/3H6 Fab P113A and to 1.10 A ∞ ∞ Ab2/3H6 Fab P117A showed a RMS of 1.05 A and 0.86 A, respectively. The higher the RMS value the more the two analysed protein molecules differ. 3.2. Immunisation study All sera of immunised mice were screened for specific anti≠anti-idiotypic antibodies against the synthetic epitope of 2F5 (data not shown). This binding assay revealed no major differences between groups of mice immunised with different antigenic Ab2/3H6 fragments. Individual hyperimmune sera with specificity towards ELDKWA were pooled within the group and subsequently purified. Total IgG titers of the pooled sera were estimated before and after purification with protein A and protein G. In average, the final recovery of total serum IgG was 55% and the IgG concentration of the pooled and purified sera was in the range of 400≠600 g/ml. The pooled IgG fractions were diluted to 50 g/ml starting concentration and serially diluted 1:2 in the ELISA. ELDKWA specificity was estimated by end point titers (cutoff values), representing the reciprocal dilution resulting in more

than the double OD value of a naive serum control. The results are summarised in Table 4. Cut off titers in the gp160 binding assay did not always correlate with that of ELDKWA. The binding to gp160 was weaker in case of pool 1, 2, and 3, while pool 4 showed identical binding properties to ELDKWA and gp160 (Table 4, columns 3 and 4). Sera immunised with Yeast derived Fab were always lower in their cut-off titers than CHO-derived. This is probably due to differences in the post-translational modification of the two expression systems, either the glycosylation pattern or the folding, as was indicated by slightly different migration behavior in Western blot and different elution profiles in the anion-exchange chromatography (data not shown). The IgG concentration of purified sera necessary to inhibit 50% of 2F5 binding to ELDKWA was analysed by means of the competition ELISA. A serial dilution of purified Ab3 pools starting with 25 g/ml (total mouse IgG) was used as competitor. Anti≠anti-idiotypic antibodies of pool 1 and 3 were able to reduce 50% of 2F5 activity with 12.5 g/ml and 6.3 g/ml mouse IgG, respectively. In contrast, Ab3s from pool 4 were able to diminish the 2F5/ELDKWA binding with a concentration of 1.6 g/ml. No inhibition was obtained even with 25 g/ml of purified IgG of pool 2 sera and naive mouse serum (Table 4). Fig. 5 shows the raw data of the competition ELISA demonstrating the reduction of 2F5 binding to the precoated ELDKWA in terms of competition with the purified Ab3 samples. Ab3s from pool 2 revealed no competition potential whereas the Ab3s from pool 4 significantly inhibited 2F5 binding indicating a high affinity towards ELDKWA. 4. Discussion In the current study regarding the Ab2/3H6, we focussed on two experimental approaches. The first one deals with the molec-

ular examination of the antigen-binding site of Ab2/3H6. The second approach involves the generation of 2F5-like antibodies in BALB/c mice after immunisation. Polyreactivity of germline-encoded antibodies is determined by a relatively high structural flexibility and a rather low antigenic affinity. Affinity maturation of antibody molecules during the development of the humoral immune response results in the introduction of somatic mutations especially in the hypervariable CDR loops with the H3 segment displaying the largest variety in its length, sequential and structural variability among all six CDR segments (Chothia et al., 1989; Al-Lazikani et al., 1997). These properties confer the CDR-H3 segment a distinctive role in antigen recognition (Shirai et al., 1999). We introduced several alanine substitutions in the CDR-H3 of Ab2/3H6 predicted 2F5-binding site (Table 1) to demonstrate the binding contribution of single amino acid residues (Winkler et al., 2000; Zwick et al., 2003). According to the structures of the homology modelled CDR-H3 versions indicated in Fig. 4 and the provided RMS values the switch to alanine residues in the loop and the base region revealed no significant changes of the main chain conformation. Interestingly, the proline alanine substitution in the CDR-H3 loop of clone P113A did not result in complete loss of antigen binding capacity, although in general proline substitutions are predicted to be crucial for the loop conformation and stability. The same was observed for the proline/alanine substitution in the base of P116A CDR-H3, indi-

Fig. 5. Competition ELISA of Ab2/3H6 immunised mice sera. Purified serum samples were serially diluted with a starting concentration of 50 g/ml and incubated with a constant amount of biotinylated 2F5. The 50% binding inhibition was considered to be the concentration at which 2F5 binds to the synthetic epitope ELDKWA with half-maximum OD.

cating only marginal loss of affinity compared to the wild type Ab2/3H6 Fab fragment. Our immunochemical and in vitro results demonstrated that the two proline residues do not contribute to 2F5 interaction. In contrast, Ab2/3H6 from clone Y111A did not retain binding to 2F5 and was not able to inhibit 2F5 activity in the in vitro test. As described by Zwick et al. (2003), one of the major drawbacks of the alanine substitution analysis is that in a case of a diminished antigen binding, it is not known whether this occurs by a direct effect on affinity for antigen or an effect on Fab stability or folding. However, in our case we are sure that the tyrosine/alanine substitution (Y111A) has a direct effect on the affinity since the Western blot analysis and the homology modelled structures of wild type Ab2/3H6 Fab and Ab2/3H6 of clone Y111A showed similar behavior. Thus, we conclude that the tyrosine residue in position 111 represents a key residue essential for 2F5 binding (Nikula et al., 1995). The tyrosine/alanine substitution in the base of the Ab2/3H6 CDR-H3 (Y117A) revealed only minor effect on 2F5 binding. In our previous studies we have shown that glycosylated and aglycosylated forms of Ab2/3H6 expressed in CHO and P. pastoris behave similarly in immunochemical competition ELISA (Gach et al., 2007, in press) despite the glycosylation site being in the CDR-H2, which can be assumed to contribute to the binding specificity. To verify these results in mouse experiments we immunised BALB/c mice with differently expressed and prepared Ab2/3H6 Fab. The evaluation of the immunisation study with different Ab2/3H6 fragments showed no significant difference between the groups of glycosylated and aglycosylated Ab2/3H6 Fab isoforms. These observations correlate well with our recent findings (Gach et al., 2007), in which we postulated that the N-glycosylation site is not involved in the binding properties of Ab2/3H6 towards 2F5. We purified the mouse Ab3 sera with a 1:1 mixture of protein A and protein G to ensure a homogenous recovery of all mouse IgG subclasses (Harlow and Lane, 1988). All purified mouse pools were able to bind specifically to the synthetic peptide ELDKWA as well as recombinant gp160 coated onto the ELISA plate. Interestingly, as indicated in Table 4 and Fig. 5 the purified Ab3s of the different pools showed explicit differences in the competition assay performed with 2F5. Ab3s of pool 4 blocked 50% of 2F5/ELDKWA binding at a concentration of 1.6 g total IgG per ml. This means that the polyclonal serum of pool 4 is able to compete with the monoclonal 2F5 in a 50≠100-

fold excess. Pools 1 and 3 revealed the same effect at four to eight times higher concentrations. In contrast, pool 2 did not block 2F5 at the highest concentration (25 g/ml) tested. We are convinced that the competition assay in solution is a more suitable means for the measurement of the specificity for the epitope than the mere binding assay alone, since it better reflects the sterical features of the developed Ab3s. The best explanation for this phenomenon is that the Ab3s of pool 2 recognise the epitope with a significantly lower affinity than human monoclonal antibody 2F5. This effect has also been observed by Kirsch et al. (2000) who proposed that the antibody response elicited against the Ab2 reflected a pattern of anti≠anti-idiotypic antibodies with very heterogenous specificities. Taken together, our preliminary mouse experiment showed that Ab2/3H6 is able to induce Ab3s capable to bind the synthetic epitope and gp160 as well as to compete with human monoclonal antibody 2F5 for ELDKWA. However, due to the inherent HIV-neutralising activity of murine sera and since only a few isolates could be tested on account of the low volumes of sera available from mice, it is necessary to carry out further trials in other animal models, e.g. guinea pigs, rabbits, and ultimately non-human primates. Furthermore, Ab3s might need to be more specifically purified in order to establish the in vitro neutralisation system. Acknowledgements We thank M. L® schel and R.
