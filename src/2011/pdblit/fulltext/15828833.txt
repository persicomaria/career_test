Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) such as CDK2/cyclin A-E are currently undergoing clinical trials to verify their potential as new anticancer agents. In a previous article we described the lead discovery process of a 3-aminopyrazole class of CDK2/cyclin A-E inhibitors. The endpoint of this process was PNU-292137, a compound endowed with in vivo antitumor activity in a mouse tumor xenograft model. We optimized this lead compound to improve some physicochemical properties, notably solubility and plasma protein binding. This lead optimization process brought us to the discovery of (2S)-N-(5-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-3yl)-2-[4-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]propanamide (PHA-533533, 13), a compound with a balanced activity vs druglike profile. Compound 13 inhibited CDK2/cyclin A with a Ki of 31 nM, counteracting tumor cell proliferation of different cell lines with an IC50 in the submicromolar range. Solubility was improved more than 10 times over the starting lead, while plasma protein binding was decreased from 99% to 74%. With exploitation of this globally enhanced in vitro profile, 13 was more active than PNU-292137 in vivo in the A2780 xenograft model showing a tumor growth inhibition of 70%. Proof of mechanism of action was obtained in vivo by immunohistochemical analysis of tumor slices of 13-treated vs untreated animals.
Introduction Abnormal proliferation mediated by disruption of the normal cell cycle mechanisms is a hallmark of virtually all cancer cells.1 Compounds targeting complexes between cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and cyclins, such as CDK2/cyclin A, and inhibiting their kinase activity are regarded as promising antitumor agents to complement the existing therapies, and there is a continuing interest in this field.2 In a previous paper we described the discovery and the lead finding process of a new class of 3-aminopyrazole CDK2/cyclin A inhibitors.1 PNU292137 (Chart 1) was identified as a compound suitable for in vivo evaluation but also endowed with suboptimal physicochemical properties in light of its possible progression into further preclinical development studies.3 In particular, PNU-292137 displayed a low solubility (in the range 20-50 µM, depending on its crystalline state) in aqueous buffer (pH 7.0) solubility experiments. While this solubility did not hamper its evaluation in animal models as an oral compound, we deemed it could limit its use in an intravenous continuous infusion administration mode that is still widely practiced in the clinical setting. Furthermore, PNU-292137 was shown to be a strong binder to human serum albumin (HSA) in a preliminary assay. We wanted to avoid potential

problems (i.e., abnormal pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters in humans) further down the road to a clinical candidate. We thus embarked on a lead optimization program with the aim of finding new derivatives of PNU-292137 with comparable inhibitory potency but with an improved physicochemical profile consistent with a potential clinical use of a CDK2/cyclin A inhibitor. We describe here the optimization of PNU-292137 to produce a compound ((2S)-N-(5-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol3-yl)-2-[4-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]propanamide (13), PHA-533533) retaining potent CDK2 inhibition in biochemical and cellular assays but endowed with a better druglike preclinical profile. Furthermore, an in-depth pharmacological preclinical profile of 13 is also reported.

Racemic methyl 4-aminophenylpropionate (42) was the starting material to afford carboxylic acids 15a, 25a, 27a, 28a, and 36a as outlined in Schemes 4-8.6 Carboxylic acid 29a was finally prepared by alkylation of commercially available 52 followed by basic hydrolysis of intermediate 53 (Scheme 9).7 SAR and Structural Studies For the sake of clarity only a limited yet representative set of compounds is used here to describe the SAR. More compounds were synthesized to support the SAR described below.8 In a previous paper we described our first efforts on the 3-aminopyrazole class to the lead compound PNU292137 (Chart 1), and we established that a cyclopropyl ring was an optimal substituent for the 5-position because of the efficient packing with the aromatic ring of Phe 80 and other lipophilic residues in the so-called buried region of the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase.3 On the basis of the SAR learned in this first part of the class expansion, we knew that we could leverage on the variety of substitutions accepted on the 3-amino part of the pyrazole scaffold for achieving a better balance between activity and "druglike" properties. We then turned our attention to the R-position of the arylacetamido group in position 3 (Chart 1, Table 1). Structural inspection of this region based on the X-ray structure3 of the previous lead compound PNU-292137 suggested that a small group may be tolerated. Figure 1 shows the R-methylphenylacetamido pyrazole compound docked into the CDK2/cyclin A ATP pocket. The accessible surface mesh of the binding site indicates the presence of a small hydrophobic cavity, which can be filled only by a small lipophilic group (e.g., a methyl group with S configuration as in Figure 1). Moreover, the docking binding mode shows that there is not much space to accommodate substituents in an R configuration. This hypothesis was experimentally verified with the synthesis of a number of R-substituted 3-phenylacetamidopyrazoles (1-6, 8-10). As shown in Table 1, only a small group, such as a methyl (8-10) or a fluorine (4)

Carboxylic acids 14a, 16a, 17a, 21a, and 26a were prepared starting from racemic 4-aminophenylpropionic acid (39) according to Scheme 2,4 while by using its (S)enantiomer (41), we obtained compound 38a (Scheme 3).5

could fit into the enzyme cavity; more hydrophilic (13, 5) or bulkier groups (6) were less active CDK2/cyclin A inhibitors. Second, as indicated by the model (Figure 1), there was a clear stereoselectivity, with the Senantiomers (2, 9) more active than the R-counterparts (3, 10). By comparison of similar compounds with or without a R-methyl substitution, a trend was observed toward a better solubility for the R-methyl-substituted compounds, particularly in vehicles containing cosolvents that are commonly used for in vivo administration. A possible explanation for this observation may be that adding an R-substituent to the benzyl carbon atom causes a disruption of the tight package of the molecule in the crystal, bringing about improved solubility. Further expansion of this class retaining an R-methyl

substituent in the arylacetamido moiety was then planned, and whenever an interesting racemic product emerged, the S-enantiomer (obtained either by stereospecific synthesis or by chiral separation) was evaluated and verified to be the eutomer. One of the major concerns regarding PNU-292137, besides its rather low solubility in water, was the high plasma protein binding (PPB).3 We had indications that the naphthyl moiety was likely to play an important role in imparting this property. We reasoned that by decreasing the lipophilic nature of this moiety while retaining the inhibitory activity on CDK2/cyclin A, we could achieve better compounds in terms of balanced activity vs druglike properties. A first set of compounds was devised by replacing the -naphthyl moiety of PNU292137 with different 4-lactam-1-ylphenyl moieties. The

The mesh is the accessible surface of the binding site which is useful for showing steric and chemical complementarity (yellow, hydrophobic; blue, hydrogen bond acceptor; red, hydrogen bond donor).12

para position was chosen for the heterocyclic substitution because it allowed the substituent to directly point toward the solvent accessible region. A simple unsubstituted five-membered lactam (13) was as active as the parent lead against CDK2/cyclin A (Table 2), while activity was even improved upon benzo condensation of 13 (e.g., 20) or substitution of the five-membered ring with a suitable group (e.g., 15), though 15 and 20 turned out to be less active in the cellular assay. Increasing the lactam ring size to a six-membered pyridinone (14) was detrimental to activity. Compound 13 was also active in cells in the submicromolar range and scored a >10-fold increase in buffer solubility over PNU-292137. Plasma protein binding (PPB) was consistently reduced from 99% to 74%. A second set of compounds featuring other fivemembered heterocycles is reported in Table 3. The best inhibition in the biochemical assay was seen for com-

pound 24, an eutomer of 22, bearing an imidazolidinone heterocyclic moiety. This compound also has a better solubility and improved PPB, although the increase in inhibitory activity is not mirrored in the cellular assay. The structure of this compound in complex with CDK2/ cyclin A was elucidated. In the X-ray structure the compound is very well defined; the five-membered imidazolidinone makes favorable hydrophobic interactions with Ile10, as observed for the naphthyl moiety of PNU-292137 (Figure 2). The carbonyl of the imidazolidinone ring interacts with a water molecule that in turn interacts with Lys20. The NH group of this moiety is within hydrogen-bonding distance of Glu8, although from the electron density this latter residue is obviously somewhat mobile. This interaction may explain the further increase in activity over compound 13 and also the reduced activity when an N-methyl substitution is made (30-32 vs 22-24). The complex of 13 with CDK2/ cyclin A was also solved at a resolution of 2.6 Å (data not shown). In this it was difficult to unambiguously define the orientation of the pyrrolidinone, and hence, it seems that the NH in 23 helps define the orientation of the ring. Bulkier groups such as benzyl (29) were detrimental for activity, solubility, and PPB. Introducing an unsaturation into the five-membered ring of imidazolinone did not hamper CDK2/cyclin A inhibitory activity but considerably worsened cellular activity. This finding may be correlated at least in part to the lower cell permeability of 27 and 28 in the Caco-2 cell penetration assay. Adding a second carbonyl moiety on the lactamyl ring of 13 to give 21 gave a moderately

Superposition of the CDK2/cyclin A complex with compound 24 (yellow/brown carbon atoms) on the complex with PHA-292137 (green/cyan carbon atoms).12 It can be seen that the two inhibitors have very similar binding modes. Ile 10 appears to adopt a different conformation in the two complexes. The electron density for this residue is better defined in the complex with PHA-292137 than for that with compound 24.

active compound but without cellular activity. The position of the carbonyl group into the imidazolidindione ring was important for determining CDK2/cyclin A inhibition, since an imidazolidin-2,4-dione (25) was a potent inhibitor (IC50 ) 17 nM) while the regioisomer imidazolidin-2,5-dione (26) was about 10 times less active although there is no apparent structural reason to explain this finding. Again, the stereoselective effect

of an R-methyl was confirmed and in the series 22-24 and 30-32, the S-enantiomer was the eutomer. However, none of the compounds of this set reached sufficient activity in cells to warrant more extensive preclinical studies. A final set of heterocycles, the oxazolidines 33-35, the sultam 36, and the pyrrolidines 37 and 38, was then evaluated (Table 4). The oxazolidine 35 was a potent CDK2/cyclin A inhibitor, and again, solubility and PPB were ameliorated over the parent lead PNU-292137. Also, the pyrrolidine 38, despite a lower activity in the biochemical assay, behaved very well in the cellular assay but the overall druglike profile was not enhanced over the parent lead. In general the SAR around the heterocyclic part linked to the phenylacetic moiety shows that (1) it is possible to get compounds with potency up to the single digit nanomolar range using several five-membered heterocycles. Fine-tuned considerations over the relative

G2\M blocked HT-29 cells were recovered by shake-off and reseeded in the presence or absence of compounds at 1 and 3 µM. Flavopiridol at 0.6 µM was chosen as a positive reference. HT-29 cells were collected 24 h after the release from the nocodazole block and analyzed by FACS for the cell cycle analysis. Cell lysates obtained from the same cells were used to follow the status of pRb phosphorylation. The data reported in the picture indicate the ability of both 13 and 24 (as well as flavopiridol) to induce an accumulation of the hyposphosphorylated forms of pRb compared to the control and nocodazole blocked cells.

potency of the compounds still remain difficult to make because groups are pointing toward the solvent accessible region and a high degree of conformational motion is possible both for the protein and the inhibitor. (2) Physicochemical properties such as solubility and PPB can be definitely improved on converting a lipophilic naphthyl into a suitable heteroaryl moiety. At the end of this optimization process two viable compounds (13 and 35) were further evaluated in order to choose a suitable compound to be tested in vivo. Biological and Pharmacological Evaluation By comparison of 13 and 35 across a panel of kinases, a slightly different kinase profile for the two compounds was observed (Table 5). Both products exhibited a double-digit nanomolar inhibition of CDK2/cyclin A, CDK2/cyclin E, and CDK5/p25. CDK1/cyclin B was inhibited at low-micromolar concentrations, while either 13 or 35 were inactive on CDK4/cyclin D1 below 10 µM concentrations. Of a panel of 30 kinases only GSK-3 was inhibited by either of the two lead compounds; compound 13 showed an IC50 of 0.73 µM and 35 of 0.41 µM. On the basis of this selectivity profile, we would not expect a dramatically different outcome for the two leads in vivo.

Both compounds were tested on a panel of tumor cell lines including an ovarian carcinoma cell line (A2780) and two colon carcinoma cell lines (HT-29 and HCT116). Their activities (EC50) ranged between 0.6 and 1.3 µM (Table 5). Cell Cycle Analysis and CDK Substrate Phosphorylation Confirmation that these compounds were inhibiting CDK2 enzyme activity in cells was obtained through examination of the phosphorylation status of a CDK substrate (pRb) by Western blotting (WB), cell cycle profile, and DNA replication (analyzing the incorporation of BrdU by immunofluorescence). More specifically, the cell cycle profile and phosphorylation status of pRb were analyzed on HT-29 colon carcinoma cell line released from a nocodazole block in

the presence or absence of compounds at the indicated concentrations (Figure 3). It was evident that under these conditions, at a dose of 3 µM, both compounds blocked the cells in G0\G1, hampering the progression of cells in the S phase as highlighted by both the cell cycle profile and BrdU incorporation data (Table 6). Regarding the phosphorylation status of pRb, it was possible to note a clear reduction of the hyperphosphorylated form of pRb in the samples obtained by cells treated with the compounds versus the samples of cells treated with the vehicle, indicative of an effect on the activity of CDK2. All together, these data confirmed that 13 and 35 were hitting the target in the cells where they displayed an antiproliferative effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism in Vitro and in Vivo On the right-hand side of Table 7 some in vitro parameters that we used to prioritize compounds for in vivo testing are reported. The increase in solubility for both compounds was about 10-fold over that of the previous lead PNU-292137. Caco-2 permeability assay was more favorable for 13 (high permeability) than for 35 (moderate permeability). The plasma protein binding (PPB) in a high-throughput assay was nearly the same for the two compounds. In the left part of Table 7 some in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters are shown (CD1 mice). Both 13 and 35 were characterized by a low clearance together with a moderate volume of distribution (Vss). The terminal half-life after oral administration was comparable for 35 and 13. Although the terminal half-life in mice was shorter than optimal, it turned out to be sufficiently long after oral administration of 13 to elicit an in vivo response (vide infra). Oral bioavailability (Fos%) was complete for 13 and lower but still satisfactory for 35. After an oral dose (10 mg/kg) of

13 a Cmax of 21 µM and an AUC of 96 µM/h were attained. In Vivo Antitumor Activity On the basis of the data presented above, 13 was prioritized for further in vivo characterization in a mouse xenograft model to assess its preclinical antitumor activity. The human ovarian A2780 xenograft mouse model was used (see Experimental Section), and on the basis of the plasma levels reached in the preliminary in vivo PK study, we selected a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, oral, twice a day. Figure 4 reports the results from this study. At this dose and scheduling, a 73% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was obtained with a maximal body weight loss of 7% and without any signs of toxicity. Study of the Molecular Mechanism of Action of 13 in the Tumors The in vivo efficacy result in the A2780 model boosted an interest in 13 as a candidate for further preclinical study, but first, we tried to establish a relationship between the antitumor activity observed in vivo in the xenograft model and markers of CDK2 inhibition in tumor sections taken from treated animals. BrdU incorporation and phosphorylation of pRb on Ser 795 (this site being phospho-specific for CDK2 and CDK4) were chosen as markers of CDK2 inhibition. Sections of A2780 xenograft tumors were collected after 6 days of treatment at 7.5 mg/kg, oral, twice a day, and processed for the immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The IHC analysis of BrdU staining indicates a significant reduction in the percentage of positive cells in the tumor sections obtained from the treated group compared to the section obtained from the vehicle group (Figure 5A), thus demonstrating a clear effect on DNA replication.

Figure 5. Analysis by IHC of the BrdU incorporation (A) and pRb staining (B) of the sections of A2780 xenograft tumors at the end of treatment. Tumor sections were fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, and stained for BrdU incorporation and phosphopRb expression. The analysis shows a significant reduction of both BrdU and phospo-pRb positive cells in the treated vs control tumors. Representative examples of the stainings are also reported.

A comparative analysis of the phospho-Rb positive cells between the tumor sections obtained from the vehicle and the treated groups indicates a significant reduction of 50% (Figure 5B), confirming that the tumor growth inhibition obtained was related to the inhibition of the target CDK2. Conclusion A pharmacological potent lead had been identified at a previous stage of lead finding.3 The lead compound PNU-292137 was systematically modified in the part of molecule pointing toward the solvent-accessible region of the CDK2 ATP pocket in order to improve druglike properties while maintaining good activity in models predictive of antitumor efficacy. By introducing a methyl group in the S-configuration on the benzylic position of PNU-292137 and by changing the naphthyl moiety into a 4-lactam-1-ylphenyl group, we obtained 13, a candidate for further preclinical investigation with an improved solubility and lower plasma protein binding. At a dose of 7.5 mg/kg twice a day for 20 days, 13 was endowed with a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of more than 70% without significant toxicity in a human ovarian A2780 xenograft model in nude mice. A relationship between the antitumor activity observed in vivo in the xenograft model and markers of CDK2 inhibition in tumor sections taken from treated animals was found. Experimental Section

PHA-292137 complex.3 Data were collected at the ESRF ID14-1 and processed using the HKL suite of programs.10 Refinement was carried out in CNX11 using the structure of the complex with PHA-292137 as the starting model. The results are shown in Table 8. In Vitro Pharmacokinetics. High-throughput solubility, cell permeability, plasma protein binding, and metabolic stability (rat hepatocytes) data were acquired according to previously reported procedures.3 In Vivo Pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of 13 and 35 was investigated in nu/nu mice as described earlier.3 For both the iv and oral legs of the preliminary PK experiments, compounds 13 and 35 were administered using PEG 400/glucosate as a vehicle. In Vitro and in Vivo Pharmacology. Cell culture, inhibition of cell proliferation, cell treatment after synchronization with nocodazole, DNA content determination, Western blot analysis, and microscopic analysis of BrdU incorporation were performed as previously described.3 Evaluation of the in vivo efficacy was performed as follows: A2780 human ovary carcinoma (from American Type Culture Collection) was maintained by subcutaneous (sc) transplantation in athymic mice using 20-30 mg of tumor brei. For the experiment, tumors were excised and fragments were implanted SC into the left flank, 10 mice/group. The treatment started when the tumors were measurable; the mean tumor weight for all the groups was 0.13 g (day 8). Compound 13 was administered after dissolution in 50% PEG 400/glucosate. Data are from a single experiment, but efficacy was confirmed in similar experiments using different doses and administration schedules.
