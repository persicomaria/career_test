We cloned the first nudix hydrolase of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (TaNUDT1) and expressed it using Escherichia coli as expression host. Properties of the purified His6-tagged protein were studied. The sequence codes for a nudix hydrolase with a molecular mass of around 43x103 and a predicted pI of 5.68. The characteristic residues of the nudix box were highly conserved in the wheat enzyme sequence, and TaNUDT1 is most probably targeted to the peroxisomes. In the presence of dithiothreitol and MnCl2, the enzyme hydrolyses the nicotinamide coenzymes NAD(P)(H) as could be predicted by the presence of a conserved amino acid array C-terminal to the nudix box, and the enzyme has higher affinity towards the reduced forms of the coenzymes. In light of previous reports of nudix enzymes and the physiological concentration of their substrates, we found its Km values towards some of the coenzymes to be relatively high. As NAD(P)(H) and FAD play crucial roles in cell metabolism, extensive hydrolysis could be detrimental to cell functioning. We speculate that a decreased enzyme affinity may point to a built-in restriction on coenzyme hydrolysis in vivo. Furthermore, by hydrolysing the cofactors of several redox enzymes, this enzyme may well affect several wheat based processes. Ó 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction The nudix hydrolase family is a group of widely distributed metallo-enzymes which occur in the cytosol, the peroxisomes and the mitochondria of cells belonging to all organism classes. In plants, they also occur in chloroplasts (Ogawa et al., 2005, 2008). The acronym nudix points to the general substrates of the enzyme family, i.e. a wide range of NUcleoside DIphosphates, linked to a structure element X. The first characterised nudix hydrolase of plant origin was a diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) hydrolysing enzyme from Lupinus angustifolius (Maksel et al., 1998). Since then, more plant nudix enzymes were discovered and characterised, covering a wide range of substrates and cellular functions. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, e.g., 32 genes encoding nudix hydrolases have been identified (Kraszewska, 2008).

The main substrates for this enzyme family are organic pyrophosphates, including nucleoside di- and triphosphates, dinucleotides and nucleotide sugars (Bessman et al., 1996). In most cases, hydrolysis occurs through nucleophilic substitution at a phosphorus atom of the substrate (Gabelli et al., 2002; Mildvan et al., 2005). Nudix hydrolases can be divided in several subfamilies according to their well defined in vitro substrate specificity. All nudix hydrolases are characterised by the highly conserved amino acids of the nudix box, GX5EX7REUXEEXGU (U is an aliphatic hydrophobic residue e.g. Ile, Leu, Val) and a similar nudix fold (a-helix­b-sheet­a-helix) testifying of a common evolutionary origin (Gabelli et al., 2004; Weber et al., 1993). The nudix box, which adopts a loop ­ a-helix loop motif is involved in the catalytic mechanism and cation binding of the enzyme (Bessman et al., 1996; Gabelli et al., 2004; Weber et al., 1993). The residues can be found in close proximity to each other and are easily accessible from the external environment (Bessman et al., 1996). The amino acids involved in substrate discrimination and recognition are located outside the nudix box. Several subfamilies are characterised by conserved amino acid residues which most probably assist in substrate recognition (Dunn et al., 1999; McLennan, 2006). Hydrolases with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzymes [NAD(P)(H)] as preferred substrate e.g. have a conserved array of amino acids C-terminal to the nudix box (Dunn et al., 1999). Most

nudix hydrolases are small proteins (MM w 16­35 Â 103) consisting of a C- and N-terminal domain, although there are also larger proteins that have additional domains involved in substrate interaction or other catalytic functions (McLennan, 2006). Care must be taken when extrapolating in vitro to in vivo enzyme specificities (Galperin et al., 2006). Enzyme activity and substrate specificity highly depend on the experimental conditions (e.g. metal ions present in reaction medium) (McLennan, 2006). It is very difficult, if not impossible, to mimic physiological conditions during activity assays. As a result, most experiments are carried out under optimal conditions for enzyme activity. The reasonably high Km values (millimolar range) reported for several nudix hydrolases have raised suspicion about the true nature of the physiological substrates (Frick and Bessman, 1995; Xu et al., 2000, 2004). In line with the wide variety of substrates hydrolysed by nudix hydrolases, the proposed physiological roles of the enzymes are very diverse. In general, nudix hydrolases have a housekeeping and housecleaning function in cells (Bessman et al., 1996; Galperin et al., 2006). Some of the nudix hydrolases, such as MutT of Escherichia coli, can hydrolyse mutagenic and/or oxidised nucleotides, hence fulfilling a role in the protective, regulatory and housecleaning mechanism of cells (Galperin et al., 2006), while others are involved in signalling cascades and the control of levels of metabolic intermediates (McLennan, 2006). This manuscript describes the cloning, expression and characterisation of the first nudix hydrolase of Triticum aestivum L., i.e., TaNUDT1. The enzyme has specificity for the nicotinamide coenzymes, as could be predicted by its amino acid sequence, and, remarkably, also for flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma­Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were of analytical grade. DNA polymerases, DNA purification and plasmid isolation kits were from Qiagen (Venlo, The Netherlands). All electrophoresis material, markers and the HisTrapÔ FF crude column were from GE Healthcare (Milwaukee, WI, USA). The GeneRacerÒ kit, E. coli TOP10 cells and subcloning (pCR4-TOPO) and expression vectors (pEXP5-CT/TOPO) were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA, USA). 2.2. Identification of a wheat nudix hydrolase Expressed sequence tag (EST) databases of wheat (http://blast. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) were screened using the sequences of formerly characterised nudix hydrolases. Based on the partially identified sequence, specific primers were designed. The 50 end of the sequence was determined by 50 RACE [rapid amplification of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends] on isolated wheat mRNA using the GeneRacerÒ kit. Based on the putative full-length sequence, specific primers (Proligo Primers and Probes, Paris, France) were designed [50 -ATGTCCATCCACCTCCGCGCCCAC-30 (forward) and 50 -TCATAGGTTGGAGAAGGAGCT-30 (reverse)] and used in a PCR reaction using Hot Star Taq polymerase on gDNA of the wheat cultivars Estica and Chinese Spring and cDNA of the root tissue of the Cadenza variety to obtain the full-length sequence encoding the wheat nudix hydrolase. The PCR products were subsequently cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector. After transformation of chemically competent E. coli TOP10 cells, a number of resulting clones were analysed on a capillary sequencer 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using vector specific primers and the ABI PRISMÒ BigDyeÔ Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems).

2.3. Cloning and expression of nudix hydrolase in Escherichia coli The full-length sequence was cloned into the pEXP5-CT/TOPO vector and chemically competent E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) were transformed with the construct according to the vector manufacturer's guidelines. For expression of the enzyme in the cytosolic fraction of E. coli, cells were grown in Luria Bertani medium containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin. When an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 was obtained, isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 1.0 mmol/L to induce enzyme expression. After 3 h incubation at 37  C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 0.5 mol/L NaCl, 30 mmol/L imidazole (pH 7.4)] containing 1.0 mmol/L protease inhibitor [PefablockÒ SC (VWR International, Leuven, Belgium)] and 1.0 mg/mL lysozyme and the lysis mix was incubated on ice. After 30 min, three freeze (À80  C) ­ thaw (room temperature) cycles and a sonication cycle on ice [five bursts of 15 s with 1 min pauses in between (amplitude of 40%) using the microtip of a Vibra CellÔ model VCX 13 PB Sonicator (Sonics & Materials, Newtown, CT, USA)] were performed. Finally, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20 min, 14,000 g). 2.4. Purification of the recombinant nudix hydrolase The His6-tagged enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the cell lysate using a HisTrapÔ FF crude column after the column was equilibrated on binding buffer [50 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 0.5 mol/L NaCl, 30 mmol/L imidazole (pH 7.4)]. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient of imidazole (30­500 mmol/L) over a 100 mL interval. Protein expression and purification were checked by SDS-PAGE performed on 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels with a PhastSystem ¨ unit (Pharmacia Biotech) by the method of Laemmli (1970). The gel was silver stained and the low molecular weight SDS-PAGE marker was used to estimate sample molecular weight. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using an Ultrospec III UV/VIS spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). 2.5. Measurement of enzyme activity against nucleotide substrates Enzyme containing sample (20 mL) and 25 mL of substrate solution (20 mmol/L) were added to 130 mL of Tris-HCl buffer [50 mmol/L, pH 8.0 containing 1.0 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2.0 mmol/L MnCl2] and incubated at 37  C. After a predetermined time interval, the reaction was stopped by adding 1.35 mL Tris­HCl buffer (50 mmol/L, pH 8.0 containing 15 mmol/L disodium EDTA). Incubation time varied between 15 and 60 min. A linear relationship was found between incubation time and formation of reaction product within the incubation time frame tested. One enzyme unit (U) hydrolyses 1.0 mmole of NADH to AMP per min under the conditions of the assay. The reaction mixture was then analysed by reversed phase HPLC on a Hydrosphere C18 column (Bester, Amstelveen, The Netherlands) with a C18 Securityguard Cartridge (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The isocratic run [KH2PO4-K2HPO4 (50 mmol/L, pH 5.9) and 5% MeOH] for each sample (flow rate 0.5 mL/min) took 40 min. Nucleotides and their reaction products were detected by measuring the absorbance in dual mode at 260 and 340 nm. The methanol concentration in the running buffer was lowered to 2.5% when analysing NADPþ, TTP, CTP and GTP. The activity measurements were performed in triplo. Enzyme activity against p-nitrophenyl thymidine 50 -monophosphate and p-nitrophenyl adenosine 50 -diphosphate was

analysed by measuring the formation of p-nitrophenol at 415 nm using an Ultrospec III UV/VIS spectrophotometer after the reaction had been stopped as described above. In the particular case of p-nitrophenyl adenosine 50 -diphosphate, alkaline phosphatase had to be added to convert p-nitrophenyl phosphate, formed by the nudix hydrolase, to p-nitrophenol before the reaction was stopped. 3. Results 3.1. Identification Screening of EST databases of Triticaceae with a MutT/Nudix proteinlike product of Oryza sativa L. (XP_55775382) revealed two T. aestivum L. ESTs (BE404043, BJ218124). The N-terminal end of the nudix hydrolase was not found using EST databases and was determined by 50 RACE PCR on mRNA obtained from germinated kernels of the Estica wheat cultivar. The assembled sequence of the first wheat nudix hydrolase (genbank accession number GU071117) was highly similar to the sequence of the MutT/Nudix-like encoded protein of O. sativa L. (XP_550617) (Fig. 1). On gDNA level, five introns were present (Fig. 1). 3.2. Molecular characterisation The full-length sequence of the identified nudix hydrolase (Fig. 1) codes for a protein with a molecular mass (MM) of around 43 Â 103 and a pI of 6.65 as predicted by Protparam (Gasteiger et al., 2005). The characteristic nudix box is highly conserved in the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. An array of amino acids predicting NAD(P)(H) specificity was found a short distance downstream the nudix box (Supplementary data A). Furthermore, a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) was observed at the C-terminus of the enzyme. It consisted of a small amino acid in the first position (S), a basic residue in the second (N) and a large nonpolar in the terminal position (L). Based on the known 3D structure (PDB ID 1vk6) of a nudix hydrolase of E. coli, a 3D model of TaNUDT1 could be constructed although the N- and C-terminal and even an internal part of the TaNUDT1 sequence were not included in the model (Fig. 2). The 3D model shows the highly conserved 3D structure of the C-terminal domain of all nudix hydrolases which consists of a mixed b-sheet, sandwiched between two a-helices. The residues of the catalytic nudix box are mainly located on one of these a-helices and the adjacent loops and are oriented to the external environment making them easily accessible for the substrates. The substrate specifying residues are not in close proximity to the nudix box and nearly all present on one of the b-strands at the opposite side of the enzyme (Fig. 2A). 3.3. Overexpression and purification of the recombinant nudix hydrolase After isolation of the His6-tagged enzyme from the cell lysate, enzyme purity was checked on SDS-PAGE. About 6.5 mg of pure nudix hydrolase was obtained with a reasonably low specific activity (95 mU/mg protein). The enzyme occurred in its monomeric form as a protein with a MM of around 50 Â 103. Several papers have reported on a dimeric or even trimeric appearance of nudix hydrolases (Gabelli et al., 2004; Ranatunga et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2006). It thus seems that the determinants for di- and trimerisation are not conserved through all nudix hydrolases. Residues involved in oligomerisation of the enzyme are probably located in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme. The full-length sequence of TaNUDT1 contains seven cysteine residues of which four are located in the N-terminal domain. Based on the 3D model

of the enzyme, these cysteine residues of the N-terminal part are located close to each other and at the surface of the enzyme (Fig. 2A). Moreover, alignment of the sequence of this wheat nudix hydrolase with sequences of nudix hydrolases of Arabidopsis thaliana L., Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, Rhodospirillum centenum, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans revealed three out of the four cysteine residues found in the N-terminal domain of the wheat enzyme to be highly conserved. The fourth N-terminal cysteine residue and two other C-terminal cysteine residues are moderately conserved (Supplementary data A). Therefore, some of these residues may be involved in, in vivo, dimerisation through conserved disulfide bridges of TaNUDT1, even if, after expression and purification, the enzyme appears as a monomer on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. 3.4. Biochemical characterisation of the wheat nudix hydrolase Divalent cations (Mg2þ and Mn2þ) and DTT enhance enzyme activity. In the absence of DTT, enzyme activity is 15 times lower than the activity measured in the presence of 1.0 mmol/L DTT. This has also been observed with other NADH hydrolysing nudix enzymes (AbdelRaheim et al., 2001). Enzyme activity against the nicotinamide coenzymes was also stimulated by glutathione (1.0 mmol/L) and mercaptoethanol (1.0 mmol/L), although their activity stimulating effect was only about half that of DTT. Of the two metal ions tested, the highest activity was found in the presence of Mn2þ with an optimal cation concentration of 2.0 mmol/L. The additional presence of Mg2þ (5.0 mmol/L) above that of Mn2þ (5.0 mmol/L) decreased the enzyme's activity. The in vivo concentrations of Mn2þ and Mg2þ have been estimated as 10À5 mmol/L and 1.0 mmol/L, respectively (Klaus et al., 2005). While, in some organelles and vesicles, the Mn2þ concentration can be elevated when it is actively transported towards these organelles, enrichment by a factor of 105 seems highly unlikely. However, in the peroxisomes, also other Mn2þ dependent enzymes (e.g. superoxide dismutase) can be found (RodriguezSerrano et al., 2007). It is possible that higher concentration of Mn2þ ions are present in this organelle than in other cell compartments. However, the Mn2þ preference could also be an in vitro artefact. The pH optimum for enzyme activity was pH 9.0, in line with previous reports on nudix hydrolases (Frick and Bessman, 1995). The catalytic mechanism occurs through a nucleophilic attack of a hydroxide ion (deprotonated water molecule) on one of the phosphate groups of the substrate (Mildvan et al., 2005). As alkaline conditions favour deprotonation of water, it is not surprising that they also favour enzyme activity. At high pH values, the proper enzyme conformation or activity are probably lost. At alkaline pH, oxidation of Mn2þ can be observed by colour change of the reaction medium. DTT decelerates this oxidation reaction and this is probably one of the activity increasing/sustaining effects that DTT has. When enzyme activity against several nucleotide diphosphate substrates was tested (Table 1), activity towards adenosine containing substrates, and, more in particular, towards NAD(P)(H) and FAD could be observed. ADP-ribose, ATP and Ap4A, although their structure is similar to that of the nicotinamide coenzymes, were not recognised as substrates. It seems that the enzyme has a preference for nicotinamide containing substrates. However, FAD does not contain such group. In line with previous reports about NADH hydrolysing nudix enzymes, the enzyme had higher affinities towards reduced NADH and NADPH than towards their oxidised counterparts (Table 2). The highest catalytic efficiency of the enzyme was measured towards NADPH.

3.5. TaNUDT1 and A. thaliana nudix hydrolases The newly characterised wheat enzyme is most closely related to the nudix hydrolase AtNUDT19 of A. thaliana (NP_197507) of all nudix hydrolases of this model plant. The enzymes share 54% sequence identity and 67% sequence similarity. As could be predicted by an array of residues C-terminal of the nudix box, AtNUDT19 also catalyses NAD(P)H hydrolysis. Ogawa et al. (2008) earlier showed that AtNUDT19 also hydrolyses FAD. The presently reported enzyme specificity of TaNUDT1 is in line with this. Further, AtNUDT19 (Ogawa et al., 2008) and, TaNUDT1 had a substantially lower Km value for NADPH (67 mmol/L) than for NADH (225 mmol/L). The enzyme is also closely related to AtNUDT23 (18% sequence identity and 29% sequence similarity). Remarkably, just like TaNUDT1, this enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of FAD. In contrast to TaNUDT1, AtNUDT23 also catalyses the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose (Ogawa et al., 2008). 4. Discussion The conserved amino acids C-terminal of the nudix box are probably involved in recognition of the nicotinamide moiety as no enzyme activity was detected towards ADP-ribose, ATP and Ap4A (Table 1) although their structure does not deviate much from that of NAD(P)(H). However, substrate specificity and enzyme activity depend on the exact reaction conditions (McLennan, 2006; Ogawa et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2003). In the present case, activity assays were performed under non-physiological conditions and the Km values for the coenzymes were reasonably high when compared to a previous report of Km values of MutT as being in the submicromolar range (Maki and Sekiguchi, 1992). It is still possible

that, in vivo, more preferred substrates are present. The nature of these substrates still has to be explored. In line with the function of MutT as a housecleaning enzyme (Maki and Sekiguchi, 1992), research should be directed towards more exotic and oxidised nucleotides capable of inducing mutations or other effects detrimental to cells. Next to the assumption that enzyme activity and affinity towards the nicotinamide coenzymes is merely an in vitro artefact, the reasonably low affinity towards some of the substrates can also point to a built-in regulation of substrate hydrolysis in vivo preventing excessive degradation of essential nucleotides. Surprisingly, FAD was a reasonably good substrate for TaNUDT1 as the enzyme had a similar affinity towards FAD as towards NADH and NADPþ. Much as done for the identification of several

conserved amino acids in other nudix hydrolase subfamilies, which are now used to predict substrate specificity, we aligned the sequence of TaNUDT1 with sequences of other FAD hydrolysing nudix enzymes. In this way, we hoped to detect a second substrate recognising and discriminating site of TaNUDT1 which would explain FAD specificity. Apart from AtNUDT23, the nudix hydrolases of Enterobacteria phage T4 (NP_049737) and Thermus thermophilus (PDB ID 2YVNA) were reported to hydrolyse FAD and were used in the alignment study. However, no strictly conserved residues were revealed, apart from the nudix box. TaNUDT1 contains a PTS signal and is probably targeted to the peroxisomes after expression. Peroxisomes are present in almost all eukaryotic cells where they function as a cell organelle housing several oxidation reactions, such as the b-oxidation of long fatty acids. Although the presence of TaNUDT1 in these organelles has not been experimentally proven and the presence of the C-terminal PTS does not necessarily point to peroxisome transport, previous reports and experimental evidence of NADH hydrolases of Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae present in peroxisomes support this hypothesis (AbdelRaheim et al., 2001, 2003). Next to regulating the levels of nicotinamide coenzymes required and produced during oxidative reactions, nudix hydrolases probably also regulate redox homeostasis and the removal of potentially toxic compounds generated by the peroxisomal metabolism (AbdelRaheim et al., 2001). As the peroxisomal NADH hydrolysing nudix hydrolases are widespread in nature and even organisms that only have a low number of nudix hydrolase encoding genes still have these peroxisomal enzymes, they most probably play a very important role in living organisms (AbdelRaheim et al., 2001, 2003; Gasmi and McLennan, 2001). Although no exact function for NMNH has been discovered in the peroxisomes, it is possible that, next to the other functions mentioned above, an important role of NADH hydrolysing nudix enzymes is the production of NMNH. FAD, the other substrate of TaNUDT1, is also a cofactor of several enzymes involved in oxidation reactions in the peroxisomes (Ogawa et al., 2008). By hydrolysing this compound, activity of these enzymes and the flux of metabolites through their enzymic cascades can be modulated. However, AtNUDT19, which most closely resembles TaNUDT1, also contains a PTS signal and was recently found to occur in the chloroplasts and the cytosol (Ogawa et al., 2008). With respect to its putative peroxisomal localisation, the remarkably increased activity of TaNUDT1 measured in the presence of disulfide reducing agents such as DTT, glutathione and mercaptoethanol seems peculiar. It suggests that enzyme activity, in vivo, is regulated by thioredoxin, although, to date, no thioredoxins have been found in the peroxisomes (Buchanan and Balmer, 2005; Montrichard et al., 2009). Other researchers studying peroxisomal NADH hydrolysing nudix enzymes also observed such unexpected dependence of the enzyme activity on DTT (Supplementary data B) (AbdelRaheim et al., 2001, 2003; Ogawa et al., 2008). More research (Northern blotting, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, purification of the native enzyme, expression of GFP-fusion protein, etc.) will be needed to

clarify the biological and physiological function and localisation of this type of enzyme in wheat tissue. As the wheat genome is not yet fully mapped, we could not yet estimate the exact number of nudix hydrolases present in wheat. Screening of wheat sequence databases using sequences of characterised A. thaliana L. nudix hydrolases already revealed 14 different members of the nudix hydrolase family to be present in wheat (Table 3). Every nudix homologue, identified based on sequence similarity, should undergo a thorough experimental characterisation to indisputably identify them as functional nudix hydrolases. Moreover, as the wheat genome has not yet been fully mapped, the present screening is most likely incomplete and the number of wheat nudix hydrolases probably exceeds 14. As O. sativa L. and T. aestivum L. both belong to the Poaceae, the characterised NADH hydrolase of wheat shows high homology with the putative MutT/nudix hydrolase of rice (XP_550617) and rice has at least 33 nudix hydrolase encoding genes (Kraszewska, 2008), it seems logical that multiple nudix hydrolases are present in wheat that also cover a wide range of nucleotide hydrolysing, housecleaning and housekeeping activities. More research will be needed to determine the exact number of nudix hydrolases in this cereal. Furthermore, due to their ability to hydrolyse the coenzymes NAD(P)(H) and other compounds vital to functioning of several enzymes, this type of enzyme will probably receive increased attention in future research. By hydrolysing these compounds, they alter/suppress the action of several redox enzymes which could be important during wheat processing. In this particular case, e.g., it is very likely that the characterised nudix hydrolase affects wheat processing as it can hydrolyse NAD(P)(H). Because of their own redox character and their involvement in several redox reactions, these coenzymes have been suggested to play a role during breadmaking by affecting the formation and quality of the gluten network (Buchanan et al., 1998; Joye et al., 2009; Tomlinson et al., 1988).

This paper describes the first characterised member of the nudix family of T. aestivum L. Based on amino acid sequence, substrate specificity and other enzyme properties, it can be concluded that this enzyme is a typical member of the nudix hydrolase family. The enzyme, as could be predicted from its amino acid sequence, hydrolyses the nicotinamide coenzymes with a preference for the reduced forms of the coenzymes. In vitro, FAD is a good substrate of TaNUDT1. Future research will need to reveal insight into the presence and exact role of conserved residues in substrate specificity, the nature of the physiological substrates, the versatile functions of the nudix hydrolases and a possible role in wheat processing. While the wheat genome has not yet been fully mapped and the exact number of nudix hydrolases in wheat is, hence, not known, the identification and characterisation of the first wheat nudix hydrolase opens the door to explore other members of the nudix hydrolase family of T. aestivum L.
