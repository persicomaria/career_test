Transition-state Complex of the Purine-specific Nucleoside Hydrolase of T. vivax: Enzyme Conformational Changes and Implications for Catalysis

Crystal structures of the purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma vivax have previously been solved in complex with inhibitors or a substrate. All these structures show the dimeric T. vivax nucleoside hydrolase with an "open" active site with a highly flexible loop (loop 2) in its vicinity. Here, we present the crystal structures of the T. vivax nucleoside hydrolase with both soaked (TvNH-ImmH(soak)) and co-crystallised (TvNH-ImmH(co)) transition-state inhibitor immucillin H (ImmH or (1S)° 1-(9-deazahypoxanthin-9-yl)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol) to 2.1 A and ° resolution, respectively. In the co-crystallised structure, loop 2 is 2.2 A ordered and folds over the active site, establishing previously unobserved enzyme­inhibitor interactions. As such this structure presents the first complete picture of a purine-specific NH active site, including leaving group interactions. In the closed active site, a water channel of highly ordered water molecules leads out from the N7 of the nucleoside toward bulk solvent, while Trp260 approaches the nucleobase in a tight parallel stacking interaction. Together with mutagenesis results, this structure rules out a mechanism of leaving group activation by general acid catalysis, as proposed for base-aspecific nucleoside hydrolases. Instead, the structure is consistent with the previously proposed mechanism of leaving group protonation in the T. vivax nucleoside hydrolase where aromatic stacking with Trp260 and an intramolecular O5 0 -H8C hydrogen bond increase the pKa of the N7 sufficiently to allow protonation by solvent. A mechanism that couples loop closure to the positioning of active site residues is proposed based on a comparison of the soaked structure with the cocrystallized structure. Interestingly, the dimer interface area increases by 40% upon closure of loop 2, with loop 1 of one subunit interacting with loop 2 of the other subunit, suggesting a relationship between the dimeric form of the enzyme and its catalytic activity.

Structure of TvNH in Complex with ImmH

Introduction
In many enzymatic processes the enzyme participates dynamically in the reaction, undergoing large conformational changes and loop movements during catalysis. The study of the relationship between protein motion and enzyme catalysis is therefore an area of active research.1­3 Mobile active site loops are also a common feature of N-ribosyltransferases, that include purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNPs),4,5 phosphoribosyl transferases (PRTs)6­8 and nucleoside hydrolases (NH).9 Nucleoside hydrolases comprise a superfamily of structurally related calcium-dependent enzymes that hydrolyse the N-glycosidic bond of b-ribonucleosides to release the free nucleic base and ribose (Figure 1).10 They are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes but are absent from mammals. The exact metabolic role of the NHs is established only in parasitic protozoa, including the Trypanosoma genus, where they are key enzymes in the purine salvage pathway that aims to scavenge purines from their environment.11,12 Since parasitic protozoa rely on the purine salvage pathway for survival, the NHs represent potential targets for antibiotic development. Moreover, in analogy with the high molecular mass PNPs, the NHs could constitute promising candidates for tumour-directed enzyme­ prodrug strategies in cancer therapy.13,14 On the basis of sequence alignments the nucleoside hydrolases have been clustered into three groups.15 The enzymes belonging to group I contain

a conserved histidine in their nucleobase-binding pocket, which is replaced by a tryptophan in group II proteins and another amino acid residue (often a cysteine) in group III proteins. The functional data obtained on these proteins suggests that group I proteins include pyrimidine-specific nucleoside hydrolases and non-specific enzymes that accept both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. Group II comprises purine-specific nucleoside hydrolases. The NHs of the third group are yet uncharacterised, and seem to pertain to multicellular organisms such as insects. Crystal structures have been solved from NHs belonging to groups I and II.15­17 These structures show the enzymes as homotetramers (for group I proteins) or homodimers (for group II proteins) of a globular a/b subunit. Their active sites contain a Ca2C and are located at the C-terminal end of the central b-sheet. Only one inhibitor-complex structure has been solved for a group I NH, that of the nonspecific NH (IU preferring NH or IU-NH) from the protozoon Crithidia fasciculata with the inhibitor p-aminophenyliminiribitol (pAPIR).9 For group II NHs, a crystal structure has been solved of the purine-specific NH (IAG-preferring NH or IAG-NH) from Trypanosoma vivax in complex with a ground state inhibitor, 3-deaza-adenosine.17 The structure of a slow mutant of this enzyme was also solved in complex with the genuine substrate inosine.18 Comparisons of unliganded and complexed NH structures from both groups I and II reveal substantial conformational changes. In the unliganded structures of both group I and II NHs, two

333 mimics of highly dissociative N-ribosyltransferase transition states24: the position of the cation charge (pKa N1 0 w9.2) is shifted to the position of the carbocation that is known to develop at the transition state, and the distance between the glycone and aglycone is increased via a methylene bridge.25 Here, we report the crystal structures of the T. vivax IAG-NH (TvNH) either soaked or cocrystallised with the transition-state analogue inhibitor ImmH. The structure of TvNH co-crystallised with ImmH represents the first image of a "closed" purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase with all loops entirely ordered and offers a complete picture of the interactions occurring in the transition state of the enzyme-catalysed reaction. The structures provide further insights in the mechanism of leaving group activation, the relation between enzyme activity and its multimeric state and suggest a possible mechanism leading to loop closure.

flexible loops (called loops 1 and 2) with low or no associated electron density are present on either side of the active site. Loop 1 is located at the C-terminal end of b3 and comprises residues 75­85; loop 2 is situated at the C-terminal end of a long a-helix and comprises residues 244­258 (T. vivax NH numbering, residues 220­239 in C. fasciculata NH). Upon binding of the inhibitor pAPIR on the group I IU-NH from C. fasciculata, loop 1 becomes ordered and loop 2 undergoes large conformational changes bringing several residues in the active site.9 Unfortunately, information about the interactions between the leaving group pocket and the natural substrates is lacking due to the significant structural differences between the inhibitor and the natural purine/pyrimidine substrates. Binding of the ground state inhibitor 3-deaza-adenosine to the group II IAG-NH from T. vivax or of the substrate inosine to a slow mutant of this enzyme also orders loop 1. This brings Trp83 into a parallel stacking interaction with the nucleobase.17,18 However, loop 2 remains totally unstructured in all group II structures thus far. Hence, a full view of the active site, that shows all the enzyme-substrate interactions, is still missing for any NH. Kinetic isotope effects have shown that nearly all N-ribosyltransferases stabilize a transition-state with oxocarbenium ion character, with a nucleophilic displacement reaction mechanism varying from fully dissociative for nucleic acid processing enzymes to more moderately dissociative in the case of PNPs and NHs.19 The transition-state of the latter enzymes shows a protonated purine base and little participation from the nucleophile.20 Based on this transition-state structure, immucillin H (ImmH) (Figure 1) was developed as a picomolar inhibitor against human or bovine PNP.21,22 It has also been reported to be a tight binding inhibitor of the IAG-NH of T. brucei brucei (KIZ24 nM) and the IU-NH of C. fasciculata (KIZ42 nM).23 Its 4 0 -imino group replaces the O4 0 ribosyl oxygen of inosine and, on protonation (pKaZ6.9), mimics the partial positive charge of the ribooxocarbenium ion transition-state. The C­C glycosidic bond provides chemical stability. The deazahypoxanthine ring of ImmH is protonated at N7 (pKaO10) similar to inosine at the transition state. Subsequently, the DADMe immucillins were designed as closer

Results
Inhibition of TvNH by immucillins A selection of immucillins and DADMe-immucillins was screened in order to identify tightbinding inhibitors of TvNH. Three immucillins, ImmH, ImmA and 8-aza-ImmH (or PzImmH),26 displayed low nanomolar inhibition constants (Table 1). For the tightest binder, PzImmH, the Kd is a factor of 2000 lower than the KM values reported for inosine and adenosine,17 corresponding to an increase in binding energy of about 4 kcal/mol for the inhibitor compared to the natural substrates (in the simplified case where KMZKS). The weak inhibition shown by the DADMe-immucillins presumably results from the absence of the 2 0 -OH from these inhibitors, since 2 0 -deoxy-ribonucleosides are poor substrates for TvNH.18 Of the three nanomolar inhibitors, only PzImmH displayed slow-onset inhibition, although all three inhibitors displayed slow-offset inhibition. Immucillins often display slow-onset inhibition as a result of a slow N4 0 protonation step that follows the rapid equilibrium binding

step (Scheme 1).27 For PzImmH, this allowed the microscopic rate constants associated with the EI5EI 0 isomerisation step (Scheme 1) to be determined: k5Z2.7!10K3 sK1, k6Z2.8!10K4 sK1. The kinetics of the slow offset process for PzImmH were also sufficiently slow to allow active-site titration to be carried out. This indicated a monomer:inhibitor binding stoichiometry of 1:1, in contrast to the half-the-sites activity previously reported for substrate turnover.28 Table 1 also compares the obtained KI values to the corresponding values for other NHs.26 While the binding properties of ImmH and ImmA are comparable between the different NHs, PzImmH shows significantly tighter binding to the IAG-NH from T. vivax. This is intriguing because the IAG-NH from T. vivax and T. brucei brucei show high sequence identity in the region of the active site postulated to be involved in purine aglycone binding. Global fold of TvNH­ImmH complexes Two different crystal structures of the wild-type T. vivax NH in complex with ImmH were solved (see Table 2 for refinement statistics). The first complex was obtained by soaking the inhibitor in

a pre-existing protein crystal (TvNH­ImmH(soak)). ° This structure was refined to 2.1 A resolution, yielding a final R-factor of 17.81% (RfreeZ22.52%). Since conformational changes induced by inhibitor binding can be potentially obstructed by crystal packing restraints when soaking an inhibitor into a crystal, a second complex was generated by co-crystallisation of ImmH with the enzyme (TvNH­ImmH(co)). This structure was refined to ° 2.2 A resolution, yielding a final R-factor of 16.74% (RfreeZ22.61%). Both complexes contain a homodimer in the asymmetric unit with both active sites fully occupied with ImmH. All monomers show the characteristic a/b core composed of an eightstranded mixed b-sheet, with seven parallel and one antiparallel strand, and several surrounding a-helices.10,16,17 The TvNH­ImmH(soak) complex shows an open protein structure (Figure 2). Loop 1 (amino acid residues 75­85) that consists of a coil connecting b3 to a3 and the N-terminal part of a3, was included in the model but shows great flexibility, typified by high B-factors. Main-chain ° B-factors in this region are as high as 65 A2, ° compared to a mean B-factor of 29 A2 for all mainchain atoms. Loop 2 is completely disordered and the corresponding residues (residues 245­257 in subunit A and 245­255 in subunit B) were omitted from the model due to a lack of electron density. Both ImmH molecules are also loosely bound in the ° active site, with a mean B-factor of 50 A2 calculated over all atoms of both ImmH molecules. No significant conformational changes could be observed upon comparing the TvNH-ImmH(soak) complex with the unliganded TvNH (PDB 1HOZ). By contrast, the co-crystallised complex TvNH­ ImmH(co) shows a closed conformation, with significant conformational changes in the loops

335 the IAG-NH from T. vivax is a dimer in the crystal structure.29 The dimer interface of the latter differs completely in comparison to the subunit interfaces in the group I NHs, involving different secondary structure elements. In TvNH the dimer interface is formed by the helices a3, a9 and a10, with a3 of one monomer interacting with a9 and a10 of the other subunit. The accessible surface area (ASA) buried in the interface of the ° unliganded TvNH (PDB 1HOZ) is about 876 A2 and is mainly non-polar. In the complexes with 3-deaza-adenosine (PDB 1HP0) and inosine (PDB ° 1KIC) the interfacial ASA is increased to 1043 A2 ° and 920 A2, respectively, primarily as a result of loop 1 ordering. In the TvNH­ImmH(soak) ° complex, the buried ASA (867 A2) is similar to the unliganded TvNH, stressing again the open nature of this complex. However, ordering of loop 1 and loop 2 in the TvNH-ImmH(co) complex results in an increase of the buried ASA to ° 1232 A2, significantly higher than in either the unliganded or 3-deaza-adenosine/inosine bound forms. Part of this increase results from a lengthening of helices a3 and a10 (via ordering of loop 1 and loop 2, respectively), that form part of the dimer interface (Figure 3). Furthermore, the ordered loop 1 (a3) of one subunit interacts with the ordered loop 2 (a10) of the other subunit and vice versa. Several new contacts (including one hydrogen bond) are formed between residues of a3 of one subunit and a10 of the other subunit. The a-helical part of loop 2 also interacts with the loop connecting b2 with a2 of the other subunit. This latter loop harbours the active site residue Asp40. These new interface interactions cause a small rotation (about 38, with the rotation axis nearly perpendicular to the a10 helices) of one subunit with respect to the other compared to the unliganded TvNH, bringing the active sites slightly closer to each other. ImmH properties Table 3 lists the parameters describing the conformation of ImmH bound to the active site of TvNH and compares these with other ligands bound in the active site of NHs. The iminoribitol moiety adopts a C4 0 -endo conformation, corresponding to a pseudorotation phase angle of about 2308. This conformation differs from the preferred C2 0 -endo conformation of free ImmH 4 and is energetically unfavourable.29 However, in substrates this conformation favours the formation of a ribooxocarbenium-ion transition state due to an N9­C1 0 ­C2 0 ­H2 0 dihedral angle of 08, allowing orbital overlap between the breaking N9­C1 0 bond and the C2 0 ­H2 0 bond.20 A comparable conformation was observed for ImmH bound to calf spleen PNP.4 Also inosine bound in the active site of the slow Asp10Ala mutant of TvNH adopts a similar conformation.18 The 5 0 OH torsion angle (O5 0 ­C5 0 ­C4 0 ­N4 0 ) ranges from 398 to 508 and is on average somewhat lower than the

surrounding the active site being evident (Figure 2). Loop 1 is completely fixed with B-factors as low as the mean value for the entire protein. Loop 2 closes over the active site and clear density is present for the entire loop (although B-factors are somewhat higher than the mean). The N-terminal part of loop 2 (amino acid residues 245 to 252) adopts a helical secondary structure and forms a kinked C-terminal ´ extension to helix a10 (see Versees et al.17 for numbering of the helices). The C-terminal part of loop 2 forms a coil connecting a10 to a11. The ordering of loop 2 brings residues Arg252, Asp255 and Tyr257 into the active site. The side-chain of Arg252 extends entirely into the active site and interacts with the O6 exocyclic carbonyl of ImmH. The closing of the TvNH­ImmH(co) structure also results in an increased ordering of the ImmH ligand ° in the active site with a mean B-factor of 15 A2, lower than the mean B-factor over all protein main° chain atoms (19 A 2). The rest of the protein backbone is mainly unaffected by ImmH binding, ° with an rms deviation of 0.299 A between all mainchain atoms of one subunit of TvNH-ImmH(co) and of the unliganded TvNH (PDB 1HOZ), and besides the two loops no other large conformational changes are observed. Furthermore, no significant asymmetry is observed in the global fold of the A and B subunits of the TvNH-ImmH(co) structure, ° with an rms deviation of 0.318 A between all mainchain atoms of both subunits.

corresponding angle observed in the TvNH(Asp10Ala)­inosine complex, bringing the 5 0 OH closer above the ribosyl ring. The glycosidic torsion angle c (N4 0 ­C1 0 ­C9­C4) is close to 1808, characteristic of an anti conformation with the base pointing away from the ribose moiety. The same orientation was observed for inosine bound to TvNH(Asp10Ala), while a syn conformation was observed for 3-deaza-adenosine bound to the wild-type TvNH.17 A recent molecular dynamics study suggested the syn conformation as catalytically relevant.30 This simulation suggested that the ground state substrate could bind in either syn or anti conformation, but that during the reaction the substrate in the anti conformation underwent base flipping. Our present study disfavours this hypothesis, since it shows the transition-state analogue tightly bound in the anti conformation, suggesting the latter conformation as the catalytically relevant one.

Active site: TvNH­ImmH interactions Four ImmH­protein interactions newly appear or ° are changed by more than 0.3 A in the TvNH­ ImmH(co) structure compared to the previous TvNH complexes (see Table 4 and Figure 4). A first striking difference is the interaction between Arg252 and the O6 carbonyl of the 9-deazahypoxanthine ring of ImmH. The side-chain of Arg252 is brought into the active site by the closure of loop 2, ° ° placing its NH2 atom within 2.4 A (2.5 A in the A subunit) of O6. The Arg252 side-chain is further held in place by an interaction of its other guanido N-atom with the carboxyl side-chain and carbonyl main-chain of Asp255, also a residue of loop 2.

A second interaction with the leaving group not detected in the other structures is the interaction between Asp40 and the N3 atom of ImmH, with the ° carboxyl oxygen of Asp40 located at 2.6 A from the N3. In all the previous structures, this interaction was not observed because of experimental artefacts. In the TvNH­3deaza-adenosine complex this interaction was impossible because of the syn ` conformation of the leaving base vis-a-vis the ribose. In the Asp10Ala mutant, Asp40 was shifted away from the base due to the mutation. The pKa of Asp40 in a docked enzyme­substrate complex was recently calculated to be approximately 7.2 to 7.8, making it protonated at physiological pH and allowing a hydrogen bond with N3.30

A third difference in the leaving group pocket concerns the indole side-chain of Trp260, which moves closer to the 9-deazahypoxanthine ring. Trp260 is involved in a tilted parallel aromatic stacking interaction with the leaving group, and in the transition-state complex the CH2 atom of ° Trp260 moves 0.6 A closer to the N7 of ImmH. In contrast to the ribose moiety of substrates, ImmH is likely to be protonated (at N4 0 ) in the TvNH­ImmH(co) structure,31 introducing a full positive charge where none was present in the other crystal complexes. Despite this extra charge, little change is apparent in the binding interactions in this region of the active site, the only difference being a closer interaction of Asn186 with the

inhibitor. The Asn186 side-chain carbonyl is located ° at 3.05 A from the N4 0 , while the corresponding distance with the O4 0 in the Asp10Ala­inosine ° complex was almost 3.9 A. The N7 and N1 of the leaving group in the TvNH­ImmH(co) complex do not interact with any enzyme residues. Instead, both nitrogen atoms interact with bulk water via a channel of highly ordered water molecules (Figures 4 and 5). This is especially apparent in the case of N7. Using the numbering of the B subunit, N7 is hydrogen ° bonded to wat4 (N­O distance of 2.66 A). This water in its turn is hydrogen bonded to two other water molecules, wat215 and wat217, and so forth. These water molecules are tightly held in place via numerous interactions with amino acid residues, mainly provided by loop 2. B-factors for wat4, ° ° ° wat215 and wat217 are 22.6 A2, 19.9 A2 and 19.8 A2, ° 2 for all respectively, compared to a mean of 19.0 A protein atoms (this is even more pronounced for the corresponding water molecules in the A subunit ° ° ° with B-factors of 15.7 A2, 9.2 A2 and 17.8 A2, respectively). wat4 interacts with the side-chain of Arg252; wat215 is within interaction distance with the side-chain of Asp255 and the main-chain carbonyl of Gly256; and wat217 is within interaction distance with the side-chain of Asp255 and the main-chain carbonyl of Asn173. Mechanism of loop closure A possible route leading to the closure of loop 2 upon ImmH binding (Figure 6) is suggested by the observed "flipping" of the Trp242 side-chain in the TvNH­ImmH(co) structure, as compared to all other TvNH crystal structures solved so far (the Trp242 dihedral angle CA­CB­CG­CD2 is 3.28 and 1898 in TvNH­ImmH(co) and TvNH­ImmH(soak), respectively). Trp242 is part of helix a10 at the N-terminal side of loop 2. In most previously solved structures, Asp14 adopted two alternative

Figure 6. Proposed mechanism for loop 2 closure. A superposition of the relevant residues of TvNH­ ImmH(co) and TvNH­ImmH(soak) is shown. TvNH­ImmH(co) with a closed loop 2 is coloured green, TvNH­ImmH(soak) with an unstructured loop 2 is coloured yellow. The inhibitor (in grey) and the Ca2C (blue sphere) are also shown. Flipping of the Trp242 side-chain in TvNH­ImmH(co) compared to TvNH­ ImmH(soak) forces Asp14 into a "catalytic" conformation. This conformation allows Asp14 and Tyr257 to interact, pulling Tyr257 into the active site with concomitant release of a bridging water molecule (shown as a yellow sphere). The void left by Tyr257 is then occupied by residues from loop 2, allowing the structuring of this loop (see the text for further details). The Figure was made with MOLSCRIPT.61

conformations: one "catalytic conformation" pointing toward the 2 0 OH, and another "non-catalytic conformation" pointing away from the active site. In the TvNH­ImmH(co) structure Asp14 is prevented from assuming the non-catalytic conformation by the side-chain of Trp242. The locked catalytic conformation of Asp14 allows it to form a new interaction with the phenol OH of Tyr257 ° (3.27 A), which is located at the C terminus of loop 2. In TvNH­ImmH(co) the Tyr257 side-chain rotates compared to its position in the TvNH­ImmH(soak) complex, placing its hydroxyl group deeper into the active site. In the TvNH­ImmH(soak) complex the side-chains of Tyr257 and Asp14 hydrogen bond to the same bridging water molecule, which is released upon loop closure. Loop closure also results in closer interactions of the Tyr257 with the ° ° side-chain of Asn12 (2.76 A versus 3.26 A) and the ° main-chain amide nitrogen from Asp14 (3.11 A ° versus 6.27 A)(not shown in Figure 6). The void left by the dislocation of the Tyr257 side-chain is

 Note that the alternative order of events, where ImmH forces Asp14 into the catalytic conformation, allowing the Trp242 side-chain to flip, is also possible.

filled by residues Cys248 and Arg252 of loop 2, allowing loop 2 to adopt its closed conformation. Role of Asp40 and Arg252 in the catalytic mechanism The closed active site of TvNH­ImmH(co) shows two new possible enzyme-leaving group interactions involving Arg252 and Asp40. To probe the contribution of these residues to catalysis, both were mutated to alanine and the effect of these mutations on the hydrolysis rate of various substrates was monitored using steady-state kinetics (Table 5). The fraction of this catalytic contribution owing to leaving group activation can be quantified by comparing the hydrolysis rate of guanosine with that of 7-methylguanosine. The latter is a substrate analogue with an activated (positively charged) purine ring, needing no further leaving group activation.32,33 The Arg252 guanido-group (located on loop 2) is ° situated at about 2.5 A from the exocyclic carbonyl at position 6 of ImmH, suggesting a strong interaction. However, mutation of Arg252 to alanine resulted in only small changes in kcat/KM and kcat for the substrates tested. Thus, Arg252 appears to play a minor role in catalysis, consistent with the observation that wild-type TvNH displays similar kcat/KM values and kcat values for guanosine (carbonyl group at position 6), adenosine (amino group at position 6) and purine riboside (no exocyclic group at position 6).18 Moreover, Arg252 does not seem to contribute to the discrimination shown by TvNH against pyrimidine nucleosides, since mutating it has no effect on the kinetics of cytidine hydrolysis. Mutation of Arg252 does have a small effect on binding, as reflected by the ca fivefold increase in KM for Guo and KI for ImmH, while the KM for adenosine and KI for ImmA remain relatively constant (Table 1). A larger effect was seen upon mutation of Asp40 to alanine, which resulted in a 25-fold decrease in
 Ribose release is known to be the rate-determining step in the hydrolytic direction under steady-state conditions. kcat therefore indicates the rate of ribose release and not the rate of chemistry. kcat/KM reports on steps up to and including the first irreversible step. Recent transient kinetic data indicate this to be either the N-glycosidic bond cleavage step or the base release step.

kcat/KM for guanosine but, interestingly, no change in kcat/KM for 7-methylguanosine. This indicates that Asp40 might have some role in leaving group activation, via interaction with the N3 of the 9-deazahypoxanthine ring. It was shown before that the N3 is mechanistically important, since 3-deaza-adenosine is not hydrolysed by the enzyme.17 However, it is not clear whether the lack of activity with 3-deaza-adenosine is caused by the loss of an essential catalytic interaction, by a global electronic rearrangement of the nucleobase, or by the "base flipping" of the 3-deaza-adenine ring resulting in a catalytically incompetent syn conformation, as observed in the TvNH­3deaza-adenosine crystal structure.

Discussion
The closed-form T. vivax IAG-NH: implications for the catalytic mechanism All previous crystal structures of TvNH showed the active site in the open conformation, with two unstructured flexible loops in the vicinity of the active site.17,18 Binding of a substrate or a substrate analogue ordered one of these two loops (loop 1), bringing Trp83 into the active site, hence completing an aromatic stacking sandwich involving the purine ring, Trp83 and Trp260.18 In the work presented here, co-crystallisation of TvNH with the transition-state analogue ImmH has resulted in ordering of the second loop (loop 2), forming the closed active site conformation for the first time with the entire active site visible. Soaking of the same inhibitor in the active site of a pre-existing protein crystal failed to induce the same changes, and leaves the enzyme in a completely open form with both loops largely disordered. The observed large-scale conformational changes associated with loop closure, with a nearly 38 rotation of the two subunits toward each other, are probably prevented by the crystal packing contacts. Nucleoside hydrolases are believed to reach their tremendous catalytic power (w17.7 kcal/mol)34 for the hydrolysis of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides using a combination of three strategies: activation of the nucleophile using Asp10 as a general base aided by the Ca 2C, steric and electrostatic stabilisation of the oxocarbenium

341 from C. fasciculata,20 PNPs,43 and PRTs44) proceed by a mechanism involving pre-equilibrium protonation at N7. Protonation of the nucleoside base by an enzymatic general acid prior to reaching the transition-state facilitates departure of an uncharged leaving nucleobase. In the group I IU-NH from C. fasciculata, mutagenesis studies identified a histidine (His241) as the most likely candidate for the role of general acid.45 This histidine is replaced by a tryptophan (Trp260) in the group II IAG-NH from T. vivax. Trp260, together with Trp83, forms a parallel p­p-stacking interaction with the nucleobase. Using experimental approaches and ab initio quantum chemical studies, we recently showed that this parallel aromatic stacking interaction between the purine ring of the substrate and Trp260 activates the purine leaving group by raising the pKa of N7, hence facilitating its protonation.33 Using the same approach, we subsequently showed that the substrate 5 0 OH also contributes to the activation of the nucleic base via an unusual intra-molecular O5 0 ­HC8 hydrogen bond.38 Combined together, aromatic stacking with Trp260 and the intramolecular O5 0 ­H­C8 hydrogen bond formation could raise the pKa of a purine nucleoside sufficiently to promote direct protonation by solvent. The present findings give clear structural support for this mechanism. The completely closed active site of the TvNH­ ImmH(co) complex shows only four interaction partners with the nucleobase: Trp260, Trp83, Arg252 and Asp40 (see Figure 4), the latter three seemingly having no prominent role in leaving group activation. The Trp260 side-chain on the ° other hand approaches the N7 by 0.6 A in the transition-state structure, corroborating its central role in leaving group activation. The N7 does not interact with an amino acid residue, but is connected to bulk solvent by a network of highly ordered water molecules (Figure 5). This water channel, aided by the polar residues lining it (e.g. Arg252 and Asp255), could act as a proton relay system shuttling protons directly to the high pKa N7. A mechanism for loop closure and possible implications for active site communication The TvNH-ImmH(co) crystal structure provides a clue for a mechanism leading to closure of loop 2 (see Figure 6 and Results for details). This mechanism links the 2 0 OH group of the substrate/ inhibitor via a conformational change of Asp14 and Trp242 to loop closure. The actual trigger for this process remains elusive. Conceivably, binding of ImmH, induces the "flipping" of Trp242, which in its turn forces Asp14 into one determined, catalytic conformation. Alternatively, a stronger 2 0 OH-Asp14 interaction in the ImmH complex causes restraining of Asp14 in one catalytic conformation by itself, with the torsional flip of the Trp242 side-chain filling up the gap left by Asp14 as a second event. The catalytic conformation of Asp14 then allows

ion and activation of the leaving nucleobase. The TvNH-ImmH(co) structure, which contains a fully ordered leaving group pocket, now allows us to refine the current model for the catalytic mechanism of group II nucleoside hydrolases. Ribose binding pocket All the TvNH crystal structures show the ribose moiety of the nucleoside tightly bound buried away from solvent, with its hydroxyl groups interacting with one or more amino acid residues (see also Table 4). The 2 0 and 3 0 hydroxyl groups also interact with the Ca2C. Many of the ribose-interacting residues have been shown to be involved both in catalysis and in substrate binding.35 The multiple enzyme­ribose interactions may be exploited for catalysis in several ways. Incremental binding energy can be utilised to distort the ribose ring in a reactive geometry during transition-state formation (steric catalysis). Additionally, the interactions could partially deprotonate the hydroxyl groups and stabilise the developing positive charge on the oxocarbenium (electrostatic catalysis).36 Such catalytic interactions are expected to be stronger in the transition-state than in the ground state. However, within the error margins of the crystal structure, only the Asn186-N4 0 interaction is significantly shorter in the TvNH­ImmH(co) complex compared to the corresponding Asn186O4 0 interaction in the ground state complexes ° ° (3.05 A versus 3.88 A). Moreover, this change may be artificially increased as a result of the positive charge at the N4 0 .27,37 In contrast, the corresponding O4 0 remains partially negatively charged, even in the oxocarbenium-ion transition state.38 This is nicely illustrated by a molecular dynamics study comparing the binding of protonated p-aminophenyl-(1S)-iminoribitol (pAPIR) to the IU-NH from C. fasciculata with the binding of the ground state and transition state of inosine.39 The calculated Asn168(OD1)-N4 0 distance for protonated pAPIR ° was 2.9 A, which is in good agreement with the Asn186(OD1)-N4 0 distance in our structure. The calculated Asn168(OD1)-O4 0 distance on the other ° ° hand was 4.4 A and 3.8 A for ground state and transition-state inosine, respectively. Although the short Asn186-N4 0 interaction might not be fully relevant to the reaction mechanism it could account for the tight binding of ImmH. Hydrogen bonds between charged groups and uncharged groups can be worth w 4 kcal/mol,40 similar to the observed increase in binding energy of ImmH relative to the natural substrates. Purine binding pocket Activation of the leaving group by N7 protonation is another recurring catalytic strategy in both non-enzymatic 41 and enzymatic cleavage42 of N-glycosidic bonds in purine nucleosides. Kinetic isotope effect studies have shown that several purine N-ribosyltransferases (including the IU-NH

342 interaction with Tyr257, after the latter has moved into the active site with concomitant release of the bridging water molecule. The dislocation of Tyr257 finally frees the space for loop 2 to adopt the closed conformation. Binding of ImmH to TvNH and the concomitant loop ordering is also accompanied by changes in quaternary structure that suggest a form of inter-subunit active-site communication. In the TvNH-ImmH(co) structure the subunit interface area is significantly increased by more than 40% ° compared to the unliganded structure (1232 A2 ° compared to 876 A2, see Figure 3). This indicates a stabilisation of the dimeric form of the enzyme associated with catalysis. The increase of the subunit interface area is caused by the ordering of loops 1 and 2 upon ImmH binding, with a10 of one subunit interacting with a3 and the loop connecting b2 to a2 of the other subunit. Therefore the dimeric form is probably also required for the proper structuring of loops 1 and 2. These three regions moreover contain active site residues: Trp260 and Arg252 are part of a10, Trp83 is part of a3 and Asp40 is located in the loop connecting b2 to a2. These observations indicate a reciprocal relationship between enzyme activity and its quaternary structure. A form of active site communication that has been reported for TvNH is its apparent half-thesites activity that has been observed during substrate turnover.28 The trimeric calf spleen PNP also displays extreme negative cooperativity, with one-third-the-sites reactivity reported for both inosine hydrolysis and ImmH binding.21,46 In contrast, the active site titration with PzImmH and the full occupancy of both active sites with ImmH in our crystal structures demonstrate that immucillins bind with full-sites activity in TvNH. Moreover, no significant asymmetry between the subunits that could account for the negative cooperativity can be discerned in the TvNH dimer. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is under investigation. A role of loop closure in the kinetic mechanism TvNH follows a complex multi-step mechanism where release of products rather than chemistry forms the rate-limiting step.28 Previous stoppedflow fluorescence binding experiments showed that both substrate and product ribose binding are two-step processes, consisting of an initial binding step followed by an isomerisation step. For ribose, the kinetics of the isomerisation step indicate that this is the rate-determining step in the hydrolytic direction. A plausible structural explanation for these isomerisation steps is movement of loop 2. Similar roles for active site loop movement in slow, two-step product release have also been described for OMP synthase8 and the HGXPRT of Tritrichomonas foetus.47 Whether in TvNH loop 2 is actually involved in the slow product release would have to be tested by direct measurement of loop dynamics. However, our

Structure of TvNH in Complex with ImmH

steady-state kinetic data on the loop mutants are indicative for such a role. Arg252 is located at the tip of loop 2 and is translocated into the active site to form an interaction with the substrate, upon closure of the loop. When the Arg252 side-chain is deleted we observe a slightly faster release of products from the active site (fivefold higher kcat, see Table 5). An increased kcat (Othreefold) was also previously observed for the hydrolysis of inosine by the Tyr257Ala mutant.18 This tyrosine is a central player in our proposed mechanism for loop closure. These data could indicate a possible involvement of loop 2 dynamics in the ratelimiting conformational changes associated with substrate binding and product release although more direct evidence is certainly required. The role of loop 2 in chemistry? Proteins are dynamic molecular machines, and conformational fluctuations on a wide range of time-scales are intimately associated with protein function and may even limit the overall turnover rate.1,48 Complexes with tight binding transitionstate analogues, such as TvNH-ImmH(co), have the effect of "freezing" these motions at some point closely related to the transition state.24 Thus, the dynamic nature of the transition state is captured and immobilised in the thermodynamic state of the enzyme­transition state complex. The importance of mobile active site loops for catalysis has been rationalised on the basis that they permit both the rate of substrate binding and the amount of binding energy between enzyme and substrate to be maximised.49 In addition to providing binding energy (by providing catalytically essential residues), loops may also play a "negative catalysis" role by protecting reactive intermediates from solvolysis.50 Mobile active site loops that sequester bound substrate or inhibitor from solvent are a common feature of N-ribosyltransferases. It has been proposed for both PNPs4 and PRTs6 that exclusion of bulk solvent during catalysis reduces the extent of hydrolysis of the (labile) intermediates. This negative catalytic function is clearly not applicable for the hydrolytic TvNH reaction. Mutagenesis of the loop 2 residue Arg252 has only a small effect on the steady-state kinetics of TvNH with guanosine, adenosine, 7-methylguanosine and purine riboside. Similar small effects on the steady-state kinetics were previously observed during an alanine scan of loop 2 using inosine as substrate.18 Thus, specific interactions between substrate and the side-chains of loop 2 do not appear to be essential for catalysis. A first formal explanation for these mutagenesis results may be that the loop has a non-catalytic role or is possibly a vestigial structure that has lost its function. Alternatively, the role of the loop may be to alter a more global property, such as the dielectric or the shape of the active site. Single residue mutagenesis may not be sufficient to significantly perturb such global properties.

a 180 min period, Ki was estimated from the plots of n0 versus I as above. Active site titrations were carried out by pre-incubating TvNH (6 mM monomer) with different concentrations of inhibitor (0­1.4 equivalents inhibitor/TvNH monomer) in 50 mM phosphate (pH 7.5) at 4 8C for 16 h. Samples were then rapidly diluted 40-fold into the same buffer, followed by a 25-fold dilution into the xanthine oxidase assay mix as described above for a total dilution of 1000-fold. Rebinding of inhibitor to TvNH was prevented with high concentrations of substrate (500 mMz200!Km; final inhibitor concentration at zKi; kon for substrate and inhibitor are known to be approximately equal from stopped-flow measurements). Time-courses were fitted to the equation: P Z ns t C ðnr Kns Þð1KeKkt Þ=k (4)

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification Expression and purification of the wild-type and mutant T. vivax IAG-NHs were performed as described.17 Escherichia coli (WK6) containing the iagnh ORF cloned in the pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen) was used for recombinant protein production. The presence of an N-terminal His6-tag permitted purification in two chromatographic steps, consisting of a Ni-NTA affinity chromatography step (Qiagen) and gel filtration on a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Bioscience). The concentration of pure protein (expressed per monomer) was determined spectrophotometrically using an 3280 of 47,752 MK1cmK1. Typically, 80 mg of purified protein was obtained from a 1 l fermentation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to confirm enzyme purity. Kinetic analysis of substrates Initial rate kinetic measurements were carried out at 35 8C in 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.0), containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2. Product formation was determined spectrophotometrically using the difference in absorption between the nucleoside and the purine base.18 The D3 values (mMK1 cmK1) used were: guanosine, K4.0 at 260 nm or 0.5 at 300 nm; 7-methylguanosine, K4.4 at 258 nm; adenosine, K1.4 at 276 nm; purine riboside, 1.45 at 275 nm. The kinetic properties for cytidine were determined with the reducing sugar assay as described.18 Inhibition studies Inhibitor dissociation constants were determined with inosine as a substrate in 50 mM phosphate (pH 7.5) at 25 8C. A coupled assay using xanthine oxidase was used to monitor inosine hydrolysis.51 The reaction product hypoxanthine is oxidised to uric acid, which can be monitored spectrophotometrically at 293 nm (D3 uric acid at 293 nmZ12.9 mMK1 cmK1). Reactions were started by adding the wild-type or mutant NH to the reaction mixture containing 500 mM inosine, 120 mU xanthine oxidase/ml and a variable concentration of inhibitor. The Michaelis constants for inosine hydrolysis were determined under the same conditions. The inhibitor set was initially assayed at 50 mM to identify tight binders. The binding properties of the three tight binders that were thus identified (PzImmH, ImmH and ImmA) were then analysed further. Time-courses that displayed slow-onset behaviour were fitted to the equation:52 P Z ns t C ðn0 Kns Þð1KeKkt Þ=k (1)

where nr is the initial velocity (nr!ns). For PzImmH, the binding stoichiometry was determined from a plot of nr versus [I/(TvNH monomer] and then extrapolating the linear decrease in nr to the x-intercept. The value of k was also approximately constant above one equivalent inhibitor/(TvNH monomer) and the saturated value of k was therefore equated to k6 (see Scheme 1). k5 was calculated using the equation: k5 Z k6 ðKi =KiÃ K1Þ (5)

Crystallisation, data collection and processing X-ray diffraction datasets were collected for two different TvNH-ImmH complexes: one of a co-crystallised complex (TvNH-ImmH(co)), and one of a crystal soaked in the inhibitor solution (TvNH-ImmH(soak)). For cocrystallisation, a solution of 8 mg/ml wild-type TvNH in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 was pre-incubated with a 1:2 molar excess of inhibitor for 1 h at 4 8C. Crystals of both complexed and the unliganded TvNH protein were grown using the hanging-drop, vapour-diffusion method. Equal volumes of protein solution (8 mg/ml) and precipitant containing 1.6 M ammonium sulphate in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.5) were mixed and equilibrated at 20 8C. The crystals of the complexed protein were transferred to a cryo-solution containing 1.8 M ammonium sulphate, 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and 30% (v/v) glycerol and X-ray diffraction ° data were collected to a resolution of 2.2 A at 100 K on beamline X11 (EMBL, DESY, Hamburg) using an X-ray ° wavelength of 0.8131 A. The crystals of the "unliganded" protein were soaked in a cryo-solution containing 40% (w/v) PEG 6000 in 100 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.0) and 1.2 mM ImmH. After several hours crystals were transferred to the cryo-stream (100 K) and data were ° collected to a resolution of 2.0 A on beamline BW7A (EMBL, DESY, Hamburg) using an X-ray wavelength of ° 0.9322 A. The diffraction data were integrated, scaled and merged with the HKL package.53 Intensities were converted to structure factors using TRUNCATE.54 Relevant statistics for both datasets are summarised in Table 2. Structure determination and refinement The co-ordinates of one monomer of the wild-type T. vivax IAG-NH (pdb 1HOZ), with all the ligands and flexible parts removed, were used as a search model to

solve the structure of the co-crystallised TvNH­ImmH complex by molecular replacement using Phaser.55 After a first round of simulated annealing refinement56 in CNS, several cycles of positional and B-factor refinement using CNS57 were alternated with manual rebuilding in sigmaA-weighted (2FoKFc, fc) and (FoKFc, fc) electron density maps using TURBO-FRODO.58 The (2FoKFc, fc) and (FoKFc, fc) electron density maps in both active sites in the asymmetric unit showed unambiguous electron density for ImmH after the initial rounds of refinement and the entire protein backbone could be traced. After refinement an R-factor of 16.74% was obtained (free R-factor of 22.61%). The crystal structure of the TvNH soaked with ImmH is isomorphous to the unliganded TvNH structure (PDB 1HOZ). Therefore, refinement was started from the latter model (without solvent and ligands and with all flexible parts removed), taking care to use the same set of reflections for cross-validation. The refinement procedure used was the same as stated above. The (2FoKFc, fc) and (Fo­Fc, fc) maps in both active sites in the asymmetric unit showed unambiguous electron density for ImmH. Amino acid residues 245 to 257 in the A subunit and amino acid residues 245 to 255 in the B subunit were excluded from the model, due to very weak electron density in this region. The final model provided an R-factor of 17.81% (free R-factor 22.52%). During the refinement, the quality of the models was monitored with PROCHECK.59 Protein Data Bank accession codes The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank, accession code 2FF1 for TvNH­ImmH(soak) and 2FF2 for TvNH­ ImmH(co).
