The crystal structure of the complex of y-oxapentamidine and the DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG), has been determined to a resolution of 0.22 nm and an R factor of 18.9%. The y-oxapentamidine ligand interacts with the dodecamer by classic minor groove binding via interactions within the A+T-rich region of the minor groove. A chain of solvent molecules lies along the mouth of the minor groove on the outside of the bound ligand. The structural details of the complex are discussed and compared with the closely analogous complex with pentamidine bound to the same dodecamer [Edwards, K. J., Jenkins, T. C. & Neidle, S. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 7104-71091. The amidinium groups of the ligand do not hydrogen bond to bases, but are in close contact with 04' sugar ring atoms. This in part explains the reduced DNA binding affinity of this ligand compared to pentamidine.

y-Oxapentamidine [l, 5-bis(4-amidinophenoxy)-3-oxapentane] is closely related to pentamidine [ 1,5-bis(4-amidinophenoxy)pentane; NSC-6201071 (Fig. l), a drug which is active against the Pneumocystis carinii pathogen. Pentamidine has been widely used in the treatment of I? carinii pneumonia, the opportunistic infection which occurs in the majority of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Montgomery et al., 1987; Gazzard, 1989; Wispelwey and Pearson, 1991). Although the mechanism of pentamidine action against I? carinii is unknown at present, there is evidence to suggest that direct interaction with the pathogenic genome is important for its activity (Jones et al., 1990; Tidwell et al., 1990). Use of pentamidine in the clinic results in a number of toxic side effects and studies are underway to find improved linked bis(amidine) compounds with diminished toxicity and greater efficacy. We have developed a number of symmetric bis(amidine) derivatives related to pentamidine which contain a flexible dioxyalkane linkage and match the helicity of the DNA minor groove. X-ray crystallography is being used to investigate the nature of the DNA binding and the contribution of the linker function to the overall binding process. Crystal packing of the DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG), (Dickerson and Drew, 1981) involves the interaction of the two terminal C . G base pairs at each end of one duplex with those of a neighbouring duplex. This interaction occurs by the interlocking of the minor grooves of both duplexes with two interduplex hydrogen-bonding interactions of the type N-H.. .N between the guanine bases across the

minor groove. This packing arrangement serves to stabilize the DNA structure and provides an A+T-rich template at the center of the DNA that is free from crystal packing effects and to which ligands can bind. As a result, many crystal structures have been determined with a range of DNA minorgroove-binding ligands complexed with this DNA molecule (e.g. Teng et al., 1988; Brown et al., 1990). In order to investigate the mode of binding of pentamidine and various analogues to DNA, the X-ray crystal structure of pentamidine and a short-chain homologue propamidine, bound to this dodecamer have been determined in this laboratory (Edwards et al., 1992; Nunn et al., 1993). For both crystal structures, we observe binding of the ligand to

the DNA within the A+T-rich minor groove, as had been previously suggested for pentamidine from footprinting studies (Fox et al., 1990). From an examination of these two structures, we have been able to establish a rational basis for the superior DNA-binding ability of propamidine as compared with pentamidine. In the case of the propamidine complex the minor groove is less wide at the ligand binding site, which indicates a more tightly bound ligand. The mobility of the bound propamidine molecule is also reduced compared to pentamidine which suggests that the more extended ligand is less well associated with the DNA. These results are in accord with previous experimental evidence from thermal denaturation measurements as well as molecular modelling studies (Cory et al., 1992; Greenidge et a]., 1993). In this paper we extend our program of crystallographic studies of DNA recognition by bis(amidine) ligands to the ligand y-oxapentamidine. This contains an ether linkage in place of the more sterically bulky central methylene unit of pentamidine and hence provides a potential hydrogen bond acceptor group at the centre of the ligand for interaction with DNA. The sequence recognition properties of this ligand will be described elsewhere.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis and crystallisation
The DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG), was purchased from the Oswel DNA Service (University of Edinburgh) and annealed before use. y-Oxapentamidine was prepared in this laboratory as the dihydrochloride salt. Details of the synthesis will be reported elsewhere. The complex was grown from sitting drops at 286 K as colourless rhomb-shaped crystals. The crystal used for data collection was grown from a drop containing 4 pl 45% 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol, 2 pl 1.5 mM y-oxapentamidine, 4 pl 100 mM MgC1, and 4 pl 3 mM dodecamer equilibrated against a reservoir containing 1 ml 40% 2-methyl-2p-pentanediol. All of the solutions were prepared using 30 mM so-

Data collection The crystal used for data collection was of approximate dimensions 0.25X0.3X0.6 mm and mounted in a 0.5-mm Lindemann glass capillary with a small amount of mother liquor. Intensity data were collected at 287 K using a Siemens-Xentronics multiwire area detector equipped with a rotating anode X-ray generator (40mA, 70 kV) and graphite monochromator. A crystal-to-detector distance of 10 cm and swing angle of 17" was used to collect data to a maximum possible resolution of 0.21 nm. Data were collected with x set at 45", while the crystal was rotated through 100" in w at 4 values of 0" and 270"; 180-s frames were recorded every 0.25" step. The crystal underwent decay during the data collection with a 26% loss of counts between the first and last frame. Data processing was carried out using the program package XENGEN version 1.3 with the decay correction performed using least-squares scaling. A total of 9633 of a possible 11165 reflections were collected to a resolution of 0.21 nm. These data were then merged to give 3846 of the

Structure refinement The unit cell dimensions of the crystal are a = 2.469, b = 4.033 and c = 6.647 nm, in the orthorhombic space group P2,2,2,. This cell is close to that reported for the native dodecamer (Dickerson and Drew, 1981) (a = 2.487, b = 4.039 and c = 6.620 nm), suggesting that the two structures are isomorphous. The coordinate file for the native dodecamer was obtained from the Nucleic Acid Database (Berman et al., 1992) and used as a starting model for the structure refinement. Initial refinement was performed by constrained-restrained least-squares using the program CORELS (Sussman, 1984). Rigid body refinement of the DNA molecule as one constrained group was performed with the resolution range of the data used gradually increased from 1-0.4 nm (591 reflections) to 0.8-0.3 nm (1374 reflections). The R value decreased to 34.1 %. The molecule was then divided into 48 rigid groups comprising the 24 nucleosides, 22 phosphate groups and the two 05 atoms at the 5'-terminus of each .' strand. The structure was refined by assigning rigid body

rotations and translations to each of the 48 groups. The resolution range was increased to a maximum value of 0.70.25 nm (2266 reflections) with the refinement converging to an R value of 27.1%. The crystallographic refinement was continued using the program X-PLOR version 3.1 (Briinger et al., 1987). An initial 60 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimisation was performed with all DNA atomic temperature factors set at 0.25 nm2 and using all data from 0.8 nm to 0.22 nm. The data from 0.22 nm to 0.21 nm were excluded from the refinement due to incompleteness and bad agreement statistics. The R factor was reduced to 25.9%. Atomic temperature factor refinement reduced the R factor further to 24.7%. Electron density maps were calculated and displayed using the graphics package `0'version 5.7 (Jones et al., 1991). The DNA molecule displayed well-fitted density and a continuous lobe of density was visible at this stage lying in the minor groove of the DNA. A molecule of y-oxapentamidine was manually fitted into this density and refinement continued using conjugate gradient positional refinement and atomic temperature factor refinement. Electrostatic charges for y-oxapentamidine were calculated using modified neglect of differential overlap (MNDO) wave functions (Orozco and Laque, 1990) and the force-field parameters were interpolated from molecular modeling studies performed in this laboratory (Jenkins et al., 1993). The drug molecule was refitted over the course of the refinement for optimal fitting and solvent positions were included, being assigned as water molecules. At the end of the refinement a total of 72 water oxygen atoms were included to give a final K value of 18.9%, for all

data in the range 0.8-0.22 nm. The root-mean-squarc deviations from target values is 0.0025 nm for bond lengths and 4.17" for bond angles. The X-PLOR refinement and R factor calculations used data with F > 2 4 E ) (3184 reflections). The mean thermal parameters for atoms within the DNA are 0.320 nm2 for the phosphate groups, 0.274 nm2 for the sugar groups and 0.207 nm2 for the bases, with values for the yoxapentamidine molecule and water molecules of 0.199 nm2 and 0.475 nm2, respectively.

RESULTS
The structure shows an y-oxapentamidine molecule bound to the dodecamer duplex within the A+T region of the minor groove. A view of the structure together with that of the analogous pentamidine complex is shown in Fig. 2. The DNA bases are numbered C1-G12 on strand 1 and C13-G24 on strand 2 from the 5' to 3` direction. The yoxapentamidine molecule lies across the four central A . T base pairs and is displaced from the center of the minor groove with a shift of close to a quarter of a base pair (=0.08 nm) towards the 5' end of strand 1. This position for the ligand is somewhat distinct from that found in the pentamidine complex (Edwards et al., 1992), where the ligand was symmetrically bound within the minor groove. Fig. 3 shows the y-oxapentamidine and pentamidine molecules overlaid on one another. It can be seen that the difference in position of the two ligands is more marked at one end, with the y-oxapentamidine ligand showing a greater ra-

y-Oxapentamidine conformation and DNA binding
The y-oxapentamidine molecule is non-planar and assumes a twisting in the central triether linkage of the molecule and at the terminal amidinium groups. The chain torsion angles are (Cl-01-CA-CB) 167", (01-CA-CB-02) -175", (CA-CB-02-CB') - 171", (CB-02-CB'-CA') - 164", (02CB'-CA'-01') -173", and (CB'-CA'-Ol'-Cl') -173". The two aromatic rings of y-oxapentamidine are twisted by 44" with respect to each other, with the dihedral angle between the phenyl rings and their neighbouring amidinium planes being 20" and 25" for C7-Nl-N2 and C7'-Nl'-N2', respectively. This overall twist, which presumably occurs upon binding of y-oxapentamidine to DNA, results in a drug which matches well the pitch of the DNA and results in a good isohelical fit (Goodsell and Dickerson, 1986) to the minor groove. The protonated amidinium groups of the drug are involved in both direct and indirect hydrogen-bonding interactions to the oligonucleotide sugars and bases. It is remarkable that, compared to almost all of the other minor groove-binding ligands, there are virtually no direct interactions with the bases, the sole exception here being a very weak interaction with atom N3 of AS (N-.N = 0.36nm). The hydrogenbonding interactions between the amidinium groups of the yoxapentamidine and the minor groove are shown in Fig. 4. One amidinium of the y-oxapentamidine interacts with the 04' atom of the sugar group attached to A18. At the other

end of the molecule, direct interaction occurs with atom 04' of the sugar group attached to A6. In addition, solvent-mediated interactions occur to atom 0 2 of C21 and atom 04' of the sugar group attached to G22. The interactions seen for the previously reported pentamidine structure (Edwards et al., 1992) are also shown in Fig. 4. For both drug molecules we observe interactions from an amidinium group to the 04' atom of the sugar group attached to A18 and, at the opposite end of the drug, interaction with atom N3 of AS and atom 04' of the sugar attached to A6. Direct hydrogen-bonding interactions are also seen in the case of pentamidine binding, to atoms N3 of A17, 0 2 of C9 and 0 2 of C21, but are not seen in the y-oxapentamidine complex. Fig. 5 displays the y-oxapentamidine amidinium- DNA interactions viewed along the minor groove together with those found for pentamidine. The phenyl hydrogen atoms and those attached to the linker function of the y-oxapentamidine lie in close contact with atoms within the minor groove (Table 1). The central 0 2 ether atom of the y-oxapentamidine is directed towards the floor of the minor groove. However, this atom is not involved in hydrogen bonding with the dodecamer and lies almost equidistant from atoms 0 2 of T19 and 0 2 of T7, with separations of 0.33 nm and 0.34 nm, respectively. For the pentamidine complex, the equivalent methylene group at this position also lies close to these atoms with distances from idealised hydrogen positions of 0.25 nm to atom 0 2 of T19 and 0.29 nm to atom 0 2 of T7. In addition, one hydrogen atom of the methylene group lies at 0.28 nm from atom 04' of the sugar group of T20. Fig. 6 displays the d(CGCGAATTCGCG), minor groove molecular surface for both the

tamidine structure has its smallest groove width in the vicinity of the 9-20 residue separation. This feature was similarly observed for berenil bound to this DNA sequence (Brown et al., 1990). In contrast, for the pentamidine and propamidine complexes the minimum groove width occurs across the 1019 residue separation, as observed in the native dodecamer. In the case of Hoechst 33258, netropsin and distamycin bound to a similar dodecamer (Coll et al., 1987, 1989; Pjura et al., 1987; Teng et al., 1988) the minimum groove width was seen to occur at the 8-21 residue separation. The helical parameters for the DNA dodecamer of the y-oxapentamidine complex are shown in Table 2. Small differences are seen in local geometry as compared to the native dodecamer (Dickerson and Drew, 1981), and the pentamidine- and propamidine-bound structures (Edwards et al., 1992; Nunn et al., 1993).

Influence of y-oxapentamidine on DNA conformation
Upon binding of the y-oxapentamidine to the dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG), we observe ligand-induced changes in DNA conformation compared with those found in the native structure (Dickerson and Drew, 1981). Differences occur in the width of the minor groove as a result of drug binding and small changes can be seen within the oligonucleotide helical parameters. Fig. 7 shows a plot of the minor groove width for the yoxapentamidine -dodecamer complex, together with the native structure and those for complexes with the closely related bis(amidine) ligands pentamidine and propamidine bound to this dodecamer. It can be seen that the native DNA, which has the minor groove filled by a spine of hydration (Kopka et al., 1983), has a narrow groove compared with the three ligand-bound complexes. We note that the y-oxapen-

Water network In addition to hydration of the phosphate groups and bases which lie within the major groove, a network of water molecules lie along the outer edge of the DNA minor groove. A similar feature was found in the structure of propamidine bound to d(CGCGAATTCGCG), (Nunn et al., 1993). This hydration network runs along the full length of the drug molecule and is shown in Fig. 8, together with the local geometry. The y-oxapentamidine central chain atoms 01, CB, CB' and 01' face toward the outside of the minor groove with a closest approach of these atoms to the solvent chain of 0.47 nm. The water -water separations extending along the chain show a wide range of values from 0.27 nm to 0.64 nm. Fig. 9 shows the water molecules viewed from above the minor groove and towards the y-oxapentamidine molecule. Water molecule W90 lies 0.28 nm from a phosphate oxygen atom of C11, while W42 and W36 each lie at 0.29 nm from the phosphate oxygen atoms of T20 and C21, respectively.

groove ligands. As was previously observed for the structures of pentamidine and propamidine bound to d(CGCGAATTCGCG),, the y-oxapentamidine ligand is found to interact with DNA by classic minor-groove binding via interactions within the A+T-rich region of the minor groove. We see from these crystal structures that the interaction of these ligands with DNA involves a combination of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals close contacts. The specific hydrogen bonding interactions and van der Waals contacts that occur for y-oxapentamidine on binding to d(CGCGAATTCGCG), can be contrasted with those observed for the pentamidine and propamidine complexes. At one end of the bound pentamidine molecule an amidinium group lies within hydrogen bonding distance of atom N3 of

A5 and the 04' atom of the sugar group attached to A6. For y-oxapentamidine the interaction with N3 of A5 is weak with only one strong interaction to the 04' atom of the sugar group attached to A6. In addition, for y-oxapentamidine and pentamidine, either a direct or solvent-mediated interaction occurs to atom 0 2 of C21. In the case of the propamidine complex, the shortened length of the ligand results in no interaction with atom N3 of A5, but an interaction to the N3 atom of A6. Solvent-mediated interaction to atom 0 2 of C21 also occurs, together with a long interaction to atom 04' of

960 the sugar attached to C21. At the other end of the ligand for the pentamidine- and propamidine-bound ligands, one amidinium group interacts with atom N3 of A17, 0 2 of C9 and the 04' atom of the sugar group attached to A18. By contrast, for y-oxapentamidine the shift of the ligand within the minor groove towards the 5` end of the central 5'-AATT binding site results in only one contact to the 04' atom of the sugar attached to A18. The greater radius of curvature seen for yoxapentamidine as compared to pentamidine contributes to the lack of base-ligand interactions for this structure, since the amidinium groups are thereby some 0.05 nm further away from sites of base hydrogen bonding. but which did not form a continuous network over the entire pentamidine molecule. The poor definition of the solvent chain for the pentamidine complex could result from the higher drug mobility seen in this structure. For the y-oxapentamidine complex the solvent positions lie unsymmetrically positioned across the width of the minor groove and, in some cases, form hydrogen bonds with neighbouring phosphate groups. The water.. .water separations along the mouth of the minor groove are in general longer than would be expected for hydrogen-bonding interactions. Long hydration distances for water.. .DNA separations have been observed in the crystal structure of the DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTbrCGCG), (brC = 9-bromocytidine) ( Kopka et al., 1983), where a number of separations in excess of 0.41 nm are seen to occur. Whether separations of this length can be considered to be hydrogen bonds is open to question; however, we consider that some of the water...DNA separations seen for the y-oxapentamidine complex can be considered to be due to direct, albeit very weak, hydrogen bonding. An extended water network, a `spine of hydrophobic hydration', has now been observed in two crystal structures of minor groove drug-DNA complexes. The presence of an ordered water network region over the outer edge of the minor groove showing low solvent mobility in this region may be a general phenomenon in such structures.

DNA binding affinity
For the y-oxapentamidine complex, the DNA minor groove width is less than that found for the pentamidinedodecamer complex over the entire region of ligand binding, which implies a closer fit between the ligand and the walls of the DNA minor groove. The pentamidine ligand contains the more sterically bulky methylene group compared to the equivalent central ether oxygen atom of the y-oxapentamidine ligand and this methylene group lies closer to the floor of the minor groove (= 0.05 nm) than the ether oxygen atom of the y-oxapentamidine complex. The ether oxygen atom is subject to the repulsive influence of orbitals from two thymine 0 2 atoms which tends to force the ligand away from the DNA. This factor, together with the lack of strong baseamidinium hydrogen bonding seen in this complex can explain an overall reduced DNA binding affinity of the y-oxapentamidine ligand as compared to pentamidine, even in light of the slightly reduced minor groove width. These results are in accord with the relative binding affinities for the two ligands, as assessed by thermal denaturation studies with calf thymus DNA. Helix+coil stabilization values (AT,,,) of +6.5 K and +10.5 K were determined for y-oxapentamidine and pentamidine, respectively, in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at a molar ligand/DNA phosphate ratio of 1: 10. Further, molecular modelling studies for the interaction of ligands with d(CGCGAATTCGCG), indicate that the superior binding of pentamidine results from more favourable nonbonded contacts with the minor groove. The pentamidine molecule when bound to this DNA sequence displays higher atomic mobility (B,,, = 0.547 nm') as compared to the y-oxapentamidine ligand (B,,, = 0.475 nm'). We envisage that, upon binding with DNA, the methylene group of the pentamidine molecule lies closer to the floor of the DNA minor groove than the y-oxapentamidine ether oxygen atom, which induces a widening of the groove and allows for a slightly more mobile ligand in the case of the pentamidine molecule.

Hydration
An extensive hydration network is observed for the yoxapentamidine ligand bound to d(CGCGAATTCGCG),. A similar feature was reported in the structure of propamidine bound to this dodecamer (Nunn et al., 1993). In both of these structures the network consists of a continuous chain of water molecules lying along the outer edge of the minor groove, forming a solvent surface along the exterior of the A+T-rich region of the DNA minor groove. A less well defined water network was seen in the structure of pentamidine bound to this DNA (Edwards et al., 1992) where a number of solvation sites were located lying along the mouth of the minor groove,
