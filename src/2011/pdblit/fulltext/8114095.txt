Crystal Structure of the Catalytic Core Component of the Alkylhydroperoxide Reductase AhpF from Escherichia coli
Boris Bieger and Lars-Oliver Essen*
Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry, Department of Membrane Biochemistry, Am Klopferspitz 18a, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany Alkylhydroperoxide reductases (AhpR, EC 1.6.4.*) are essential for the oxygen tolerance of aerobic organisms by converting otherwise toxic hydroperoxides of lipids or nucleic acids to the corresponding alcohols. The AhpF component belongs to the family of pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases and channels electrons from NAD(P)H towards the AhpC component which ®nally reduces cognate substrates. The structure of the catalytic core of the Escherichia coli AhpF (A212-A521) with a Ê bound FAD cofactor was determined at 1.9 A resolution in its oxidized state. The dimeric arrangement of the AhpF catalytic core and the predicted interaction mode between the N-terminal PDO-like domain and the NADPH domain favours an intramolecular electron transfer between the two redox-active disulphide centres of AhpF.

Á Reactive oxygen or sulphur species like O2 À, Á ÁÀ Á Á HO , H2O2 , RSSR , RS or RSOO arise in cells by a variety of processes, involving, e.g. light, radiation, phagocytosis or the respiratory chain. These radicals present major threats to organisms by damaging their DNA, membranes or other cellular components. Therefore, cells have evolved speci®c defense systems to quench free radicals or to repair radical-mediated damages. For the latter, eubacteria like Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli use a glutathione-independent peroxidase system, the bipartite alkylhydroperoxide reductase (AhpR). This enzyme converts hydroperoxides like thymine peroxide or linoleic acid peroxide to the corresponding alcohols using NADH or NADPH as reduction equivalents.1 The AhpR system consists of two polypeptides, the 57 kDa large ¯avoprotein AhpF and the small subunit AhpC (Mr 21 kDa), which is devoid of chromophoric cofactors. The reduction of peroxides by the dimeric AhpC component uses a redox-active disulphide centre, while

AhpF restores the reduced state of AhpC by transfering electrons from NADPH onto the AhpC dimer. The catalytic mechanism of the AhpF component was suggested to follow a path similar to that of the thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which is an important intracellular reduction system.2 The internal redox-active disulphide bridge between C345 and C348 is reduced by electron transfer from NAD(P)H via an FAD cofactor. The reduction of this disulphide bridge is then followed by two disulphide exchange reactions, ®rst intramolecularly to the disulphide C129-C132 in the N-terminal region of AhpF, then intermolecularly to the disulphide C146-C165 of the AhpC component.3,4 The Ahp reductase system was shown to affect the activity of certain antimycobacterial drugs as the expression of AhpC is strongly enhanced in isotonic acid hydrazide (INH) resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.5 The AhpF component is a member of the family of pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases comprising thioredoxin reductases, glutathione reductases (GR), lipoamide dehydrogenases and trypanothione reductase. According to sequence comparisons, the AhpF components and the structurally well characterized thioredoxin reductases6 ± 8 share 27-35 % sequence identity among the C-terminal 300 residues.

2 region of about 200 residues in the AhpF components from enterobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria has no counterparts in thioredoxin reductases, but similar sequences are present in smaller proteins belonging to the family of protein disulphide oxidoreductases (PDO) such as the 21 kDa large Pyrococcus furiosus PDO.9 The P. furiosus PDO-domain consists of two merged thioredoxin-like modules with low pairwise sequence identity. Each module contains a reactive disulphide centre and shares up to 26 % sequence identity with the E. coli AhpF N-terminal region. In contrast to the P. furiosus PDO, the AhpF component has a redox-active disulphide centre only in the second Trx-like module.10 Here, we report the structure of the catalytic core of the E. coli AhpF component which lacks the N-terminal PDO-like domain. The catalytic core of AhpF shows a two-domain architecture and homodimeric organization similar to TrxR. Furthermore, we predict from the structure that the interaction between the two disulphide centres involved in hydride transfer, C129-C132 in the PDO-domain and C345-C348 in the NADPH domain, works by an intramolecular mechanism, while hydride transfer from NADPH/FAD to the ®rst disulphide centre proceeds by a two-state mechanism as in the related thioredoxin reductases. Structure of E. coli AhpF The structure of the catalytic core of E. coli AhpF was solved by molecular replacement (Table 1) and comprises 311 residues (A212-A521), one FAD cofactor, ®ve sulphate anions and 441 water molecules. Each AhpF monomer consists of an FAD- and an NADPH domain. The FAD domain comprises residues A212-A324 and P453-A521 while the NADPH domain (M329-I449) is inserted into the FAD domain via a hinge comprising the short polypeptide stretches L325-N328 and G450L452. Both domains have a modi®ed nucleotide binding-fold of the type ®rst described for glutathione reductase.11 The FAD domain is a mixed a/b domain consisting of a central ®ve-stranded b-sheet that is ¯anked by three parallel a-helices and a four-stranded b-sheet. The NADPH domain likewise consists of a ®ve-stranded b-sheet with two parallel a-helices and a three-stranded b-sheet at its two ¯anks. Contacts between the two domains are formed mainly by the isoalloxazine ring system of the FAD cofactor which is sandwiched between the two domains. The only other direct domain interaction is a hydrogen bond between Q496 NE2 and the SG atom of C348, while the remainder of the interface is lined solely by tightly bound water molecules. This lack of speci®c domain interactions indicates that the precise domain arrangement crucially depends on the redox state of the AhpF component as earlier postulated for the related TrxR.8 The catalytic core of AhpF is structurally highly related to the TrxR from E. coli and Arabidopsis

The expression, puri®cation and crystallization of the AhpFÊ domain was carried out as described.17 A 1.9 A dataset was collected from a single frozen crystal (space group P3221; Ê Ê a  60.4 A, c  171.8 A) at beamline BW6, MPG-ASMB, DESY, Hamburg. Data reduction was done with DENZO and SCALEPACK.18 The structure of the AhpF catalytic core (residues A212-A521) was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe19 and the structure of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana thioredoxin reductase (PDB code 1VDC) as search model.

Ê Ê value of 0.96 A, 0.97 A using 165 or 168 equivalent Ca atoms, respectively. Major structural deviations between the AhpF and Trx FAD domains are found in the loops connecting b4 with b5, b15 with b16, and b16 with a6. The E. coli and A. thaliana NADPH domains (38 %, 32 % sequence identity) superimpose on the AhpF NADPH domain with Ê an r.m.s.d. value of 1.02 and 0.96 A for 119 Ca positions, respectively. As the catalytic core of AhpF was crystallised under oxidizing conditions in the absence of extraneously added NADPH, the NADPH domain lacks a bound NADPH-cofactor. Consequently, the relative domain arrangement of AhpF resembles the oxidized state of TrxR.6,8 When superpositioning the enzymes onto their FAD domains, the orientations of the NADPH domains from E. coli and A. thaliana TrxR differ from the AhpF NADPH domain by a rotation of 12.3  and 5.2  , respectively. Taking into account that the orientations between the E.coli and A. thaliana NADPH domains differ by 7  ,6 it is very likely

Interestingly, three of the ®ve observed sulphate anions are appropriately placed to cap the helix dipoles of a5, and the 310-helices G334-Y337, N456-E459 at their corresponding N termini. (b) The AhpF homodimer viewed along the 2-fold symmetry axis. The two FAD cofactors are indicated as ball-and-stick models. The N termini of each AhpF monomer are located at opposite ends of the homodimer. This observation was used for the discrimination between an inter- or intramolecular electron transfer from C345-C348 to the N-terminal disulphide centre C129-C132, as described in the text. This Figure and Figures 2 and 3 were made with MOLSCRIPT24 and Raster3D.25

that the oxidized states of TrxR and AhpF allow a considerable degree of freedom for the FADNADPH domain pairing. The AhpF catalytic core forms a homodimer with the 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis running almost orthogonal to the longest axis of the dimer (Figure 1). Recent analytical ultracentrifugation studies on the recombinant AhpF-(N208A521) fragment and the intact AhpF con®rmed such a dimerization of AhpF in solution.10 The head-to-tail like dimerization resembles that found in TrxR, but differs completely from the topologiÊ cally related GR. In E. coli AhpF 1650 A2 of the Ê 12060 A2 monomer surface are occluded in the interface region by dimerization. The surface of Ê each AhpF monomer is by 2.3 % (ca. 350 A2) less involved in interface formation than in the E. coli and A. thaliana TrxR where 16 % of their surfaces Ê become buried upon dimerization (1992 A2 of Ê Ê Ê 12,426 A}2 and 2088 A}2 of 12,954 A2). This difference arises mainly from a shortened loop between b15 and b16 in E. coli AhpF, which is prominently involved in the dimer interfaces of TrxR. Homodimer interactions are found in four major regions of the AhpF catalytic core: two symmetrical contact sites between the FAD domains and one between each NADPH-domain and the oppositely arranged FAD-domain. In the interface, a multitude of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions stabilizes the dimer, but only a minority of the polar interactions are conserved between both the AhpF catalytic cores and TrxR. Four conserved interactions are found in the FAD-FAD, but only one in the NADPH-FAD domain pairing (data not shown).

Notably, the conserved residue H276 forms in AhpF and TrxR two H-bonds to the backbone atoms of the adjacent monomer, e.g. in E. coli TrxR Ê H71 NE2-E50 O (3.3 A) and H71 ND1-G54 N Ê (2.5 A). The majority of the intermolecular interactions occur between the two FAD domains, while only four residues in the dimer interface were derived from the NADPH-domain (H347, C348, D373, D393). Consequently, the AhpF monomers appear to be tightly associated along the FAD-FAD domain interface, while the relative orientation of the NADPH-domain is more affected by its interaction with the isoalloxazine of the FAD cofactor. The active site and FAD-binding The active-site cysteine residues C345 and C348 reside on the N-terminal end of helix a4 of the NADPH-domain where the dipole moment of the helix might stabilize the negative charge of a thiolate transiently formed during the disulphide reduction step. The structure of the oxidized form of AhpF shows the disulphide bridge in van der Waals contact to the planar re face of the isoalloxazine ring system. Only the thiol group of the sequentially second cysteine, C348, contacts the Ê Ê isoalloxazine atoms C4 (3.1 A) and C4a (3.0 A), Ê whereas the leading C345 resides 4.7 A above the centre of the isoalloxazine ring. The conformation of the two cysteine residues is stabilized by a Ê branched internal H-bond (C348 N-C345 O: 3.1 A, Ê ), and a further H-bond C348 N-C345 SG: 3.2 A Ê between C345 SG and Q496 NE2 (3.4 A). Despite

4 the striking sequence differences in the CXXC motif, CHPC in AhpF and CA(V,T)C in TrxR, the right-handed conformation of the disulphide bridge with its torsion angles w1/w2/wSS/w2H /w1H of 178  /À145  /69  /79  /À50  is almost identical with that of the A. thaliana thioredoxin reductase (177  /À145  /72  /83  /À54  ).6 The Ca-Ca distance Ê between the two cysteine residues is 5.3 A and Ê thereby slightly larger than in TrxR (5.2 A). Interestingly, recent kinetic and thermodynamic studies on thioredoxins demonstrated that such sequence differences in the X-X dipeptides of thiol/disulphide oxidoreductases correlate strongly with their redox properties, which arise only from electrostatic alterations in the reduced, but not the oxidized state.12 A second pair of cysteine residues in the catalytic core, C476 and C489, was found not to be involved in electron transfer or disulphide bridge formation.13 In the structure of AhpF, C489 is completely buried in the FAD-domain. Its SG Ê atom is 9.6 A distant from the solvent-exposed side-chain of C476 and hence only consistent with a reduced state of the thiols as earlier indicated by thiol modifying agents.13 The FAD molecule is enclosed between the two halves of the FAD-domain with the si side of its isoalloxazine ring mostly covered by the short 310 helix that follows the b2 strand of the ®rst half. The orientation of the isoalloxazine ring is further ®xed by direct H-bonds to I497 N, N257 OD1 and a conserved water network (WAT537, WAT538 and WAT585) which bridges to the backbone of the loop between the 310 helix and a2, I498 and the hydroxyl of Y230 in the second AhpF monomer (Figure 2(a) and (b)). Despite the rather conserved binding site of the isoalloxazine moiety, there are signi®cant differences in its orientation in the structures of the oxidized TrxR and the AhpF catalytic core. Compared to the E. coli TrxR, the planar Ê isoalloxazine ring is shifted by 0.9 A towards the 310-a2 loop while it differs from the slightly bent isoalloxazine of the plant TrxR by a rotation of ca 13  along the N5-N10 axis (Figure 2(a)). Apparently, the positioning of the redox-active centre of the FAD cofactor is highly dependent upon the precise pairing of the FAD and NADPH domains (Figure 2(c)). Furthermore, structural studies on the reduced TrxR from E. coli indicated that conformational freedom in the isoalloxazine binding site of pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases is required to compensate for the 34  ``butter¯y''like bend of the isoalloxazine group along its N5N10 axis upon reduction.14 Whereas the ribityl and phosphate groups make various H-bonds with conserved protein residues and water molecules, the adenosine-binding region of the FAD domain shows little sequence conservation when compared to the TrxR (Figure 2(a)). The adenine ring of the FAD cofactor in AhpF is displaced by 2.1 and Ê 1.0 A relative to E. coli and plant TrxR. Furthermore, the b-sheet b6b5b4 that closes one end of the adenine binding pocket is rotated by 17  relative to its counterpart in the E. coli TrxR whereas in the

Structure of the Alkylhydroperoxide Reductase AhpF

plant TrxR the loop after b3 carries an additional insertion of six residues.6 The two-state model for the intramolecular electron transfer from the NADPH domain of TrxR to its disulphide centre8 was recently proven by the crystal structure of the reduced TrxR from E. coli.15 This mechanism depends on a ``ball-and-socket''like motion of the NADPH domain such that either the NADPH substrate or the disulphide centre contacts the re face of the ¯avine ring system.15 Due to the similarity between the AhpF catalytic core and TrxR, a model of the reduced state of AhpF can be derived easily by superimposing the FAD and NADPH domains of E.coli AhpF on the corresponding domains of the reduced E.coli TrxR (FAD Ê domain: r.m.s.d. of 1.0 A for 170 equivalent Ca Ê positions; NADPH domain: 1.0 A for 119 Ca). The difference of the orientation of the AhpF domains in the reduced and oxidized state accounts for a 66  rotation of the NADPH domain. Intra versus intermolecular electron transfer between the redox active disulphide centres of AhpF Unlike the TrxR where hydride transfer proceeds intermolecularly to thioredoxin, the AhpF component carries a structural homologue of Trx fused at its N terminus, the PDO-like domain. This N-terminal segment of the E. coli AhpF (M1-E200) performs the ®nal intermolecular electron transfer to the disulphide centre of the AhpC component by its redox-active disulphide centre C129-C132.10,13 Considering the dimeric organisation of the catalytic core of AhpF, two routes might be feasible for the subsequent reduction of C129-C132 by the redox-active C345-C348 centre. First, hydride transfer might proceed intramolecularly within each AhpF monomer (cis-pathway), or second, the transfer occurs intermolecularly between the dimer subunits (trans-pathway). A recent study demonstrated that the PDO-like domain cannot be bypassed for the reduction of AhpC by AhpF. Furthermore, it was pointed out that intermolecular redox reactions between AhpF dimers are negligible. Together with the speculation that the AhpF component dimerizes in a head-to-tail like fashion, like TrxR, and employs a similar twostate-mode mechanism, a trans-pathway was postulated for hydride transfer between the NADPH and PDO-domains of AhpF.10 Although our structure of the AhpF catalytic core corroborates both notions, namely that the dimerization mode of AhpF is TrxR-like and that only the second, reduced state for the NADPH/FAD-domain interaction with its 66  rotation relative to the oxidized state makes the redox-centre C345-C348 accessible for interaction with the PDO-like domain, we come to a different conclusion in regard to the chosen pathway. When modelling the PDO-like domain from M1-E200 we ®nd that only C129 is suf®ciently exposed on the surface

(a) Superposition of the isoalloxazine-ring system and the disulphide centre of E. coli AhpF (FAD, blue; carbon, grey) and E. coli thioredoxin reductase (FAD and water, green; carbon, cyan); the FAD cofactor of the A. thaliana TrxR is additionally shown in cyan. Although FAD binding itself differs between the two proteins, the region where the electron transfer reaction occurs is highly conserved. The solvent molecules around the isoalloxazine ring system occupy nearly identical positions leading to the same network of water bridges. (b) Schematic drawing of the FAD binding site of AhpF. Residues interacting with the cofactor are high-lighted, distances to cofactor atoms are Ê shown in parentheses (in A). Residues conserved in both, AhpF and thioredoxin reductases, are shown in blue boxes. In E. coli AhpF, the FAD cofactor makes fewer interactions with residues in the FAD domain than in TrxR from E. coli and plants. (c) Stereo view of the superposition of the main-chain atoms of E.coli AhpF (red), A. thaliana (yellow) and E.coli (blue) thioredoxin reductases.

6 of the PDO-like domain to be involved in a disulphide exchange reaction with C345-C348. Furthermore, the peptide linker between the PDOlike and the FAD domain is rather short with a length of approximately 12 amino acid residues and the N termini of the AhpF catalytic cores with which these linkers are merged reside at Ê opposite ends of the AhpF dimer, ca 62 A distant from each other. Finally, the distance constraint between C129 and the redox-centre C345C348 that is imposed by any hypothetical disulphide-linked intermediate during the reduction of C129-C132 allows only a limited number of PDO-/NADPH domain pairings to avoid steric overlaps (Figure 3). Taken together, the distance between the C terminus of the PDO-like domain and the N terminus of the AhpF catalytic core monomer which is involved in the reaction, varÊ ies between 20 and 30 A dependent on the model of the PDO-/NADPH domain interaction. This gap is easily bridged by the peptide linker and would be therefore consistent with a cispathway for disulphide exchange reactions between C129-C132 and C345-C348. In the alternative scenario, the trans-pathway, the N terminus of the second AhpF monomer is at least

Structure of the Alkylhydroperoxide Reductase AhpF

Ê 50-60 A away from the C terminus of the PDOlike domain and cannot be connected by such a linker. An obvious alternative where a transpathway might be still feasible exists, if one postulates that the FAD and NADPH domains adopt a third mode of association besides the known reduced and oxidized states to facilitate hydride transfer between the redox-active disulphide centre of the NADPH domain and C129C132 on the PDO-like domain of the second monomer. However, in this case a considerably larger domain rearrangement of the NADPH and FAD domains would be required to position the disulphides C129-C132 and C345-C348 in close spatial relationship than for the hydride transfer from NADPH to C345-C348. Concluding remark The AhpF component of alkylhydroperoxide reductases is not the only representative of hybrids between TrxR-like catalytic cores and attached Trxmodules. In the plant A. thaliana and some mycobacteria, TrxR-like enzymes16 are found which contain an additional Trx-like module at their C termini. The quaternary structure of these enzymes probably resembles the dimeric mode now found

The second monomer of the AhpF dimer is not shown for easier visualization. The mechanism was derived from manual docking experiments which were carried out with the E. coli AhpF catalytic core and a model of the N terminus PDO-like domain of AhpF comprising the disulphide centre C129-C132. Only in the reduced state, can C129-C132 of the PDO-like domain (blue) approach C348 of the NADPH domain (green), while in the oxidized state, the cysteine residues C345 and C348 are occluded between the NADPH and the FAD (red) domain. FAD and NADPH cofactors are shown as sticks, redox-active disulphides as space-®lling models. (b) Overall shape complementarity between the PDO-like domain and the dimeric catalytic core of AhpF. The inlay shows the distances between the N and C termini in the docked state, while the right panel shows the PDO-like domain (blue) and the AhpF dimer (FAD domains, red and dark grey; NADPH domain, light grey). A sequence analysis by PSIBLAST26 showed that the N-terminal region of AhpF is highly homologous to the PDO from P. furiosous (PDB entry 1A8L) with a sequence identity of 26 % and a PSIBLAST score of 6 Â 10À51. Using this sequence alignment, a structural model of AhpF(1-200) was generated by MODELLER4.27 The resulting model exhibits good stereochemistry as analysed by PROCHECK.28 The PDO-like region of E. coli AhpF consists of two thioredoxin-like modules like the PDO from P. furiosous, but contains only one conserved disulphide centre (C129C132) in the second TrX-like module, while in the ®rst Trx-like module the cysteine residues found in PDO are replaced by serine (S30-S33). The docking of the AhpF PDO-like domain (M1-E200) was carried out using the graphical interface of InsightII (MSI).

both in AhpF and TrxR because of the conserved nature of the dimer interfaces.The close proximity of the N and C termini in the FAD domain, up to Ê 7.5 A in AhpF, implies that a cis-pathway for disulphide exchange cascades might operate in dimers of these hybrid enzymes as well. Dimerization would then not be a prerequisite for enzymatic function, but an evolutionary relic of the general architecture of TrxR-like oxidoreductases. Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates of the AhpF catalytic core and the accompanying structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under accession code 1FL2.
