ABSTRACT: In animals, the PABC domain from poly (A)-binding protein recruits proteins containing a specific interacting motif (PAM-2) to the mRNP complex. These proteins include Paip1, Paip2, and eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3), all of which regulate PABP function in translation. The following reports the solution structure of PABC from Triticum aVestium (wheat) poly (A)-binding protein determined by NMR spectroscopy. Wheat PABC (wPABC) is an R-helical protein domain, which displays a fold highly similar to the human PABC domain and contains a PAM-2 peptide binding site. Through a bioinformatics search, several plant proteins containing a PAM-2 site were identified including the early response to dehydration protein (ERD-15), which was previously shown to regulate PABP-dependent translation. The plant PAM-2 proteins contain a variety of conserved sequences including a PABPinteracting 1 motif (PAM-1), RNA binding domains, an SMR endonuclease domain, and a poly (A)nuclease regulatory domain, all of which suggest a function in either translation or mRNA metabolism. The proteins identified are well conserved throughout plant species but have no sequence homologues in metazoans. We show that wPABC binds to the plant PAM-2 motif with high affinity through a conserved mechanism. Overall, our results suggest that plant species have evolved a distinct regulatory mechanism involving novel PABP binding partners.

The poly (A)-binding protein (PABPC1, here referred to as PABP1) is a ubiquitous RNA binding protein found in all eukaryotes. It is the major protein complexed with 3 poly (A)-tails of eukaryotic mRNA. Over the past few years, considerable evidence describes PABP as a multifunctional protein involved in a diverse range of fundamental cellular processes, including mRNA metabolism, mRNA export, and protein synthesis (1, 2). A general function for PABP is to protect mRNA from deadenylation, the rate-limiting step in mRNA decay, by binding to the 3-poly (A)-tail and physically limiting the access of exoribonucleases. In yeast (3) and mammals (4), PABP can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and has different functions depending upon its location in the cell. In the nucleus, Saccharomyces ceriVisiae (yeast) PABP (yPABP) was implicated in multiple steps involving poly

(A)-processing of the 3-end of nascent mRNA. This includes association with cleavage polyadenylation factors (CFI), which together with poly (A)-polymerase (PAP), are involved in poly (A)-synthesis (5, 6). During the later steps, the association of yPABP with poly (A)-nuclease (PAN) (7) is necessary for trimming the poly (A)-tail to a length appropriate for efficient mRNA export. The requirement for PABP for trimming of the 3-tail and interaction of the mRNA with export factors establishes yPABP's importance as a mediator of mRNA biogenesis and export (8, 9). Recent work has demonstrated that in mammalian cells, PABP associates with the poly (A)-tail of unspliced pre-mRNA, co-immunopurifies with PAP, and remains on the transcript during the pioneer round of translation (related to nonsensemediated decay) (10). In this context, mammalian PABP was suggested to be involved in pre-mRNA processing, stability, and quality control. The nuclear function of PABP in plants has not been as clearly characterized. However, cross-species complementation studies of yeast PABP null mutants show that Arabidopsis thaliana PAB2 (11), PAB3 (12), and PAB5 (13) can partially restore poly (A)-length control in a poly (A)-nuclease dependent manner. In these studies, PAB3 was present in the nucleus of the complimented yeast strain and promoted the rate of mRNA entry into the translated pool. This suggests an evolutionary conserved nuclear function of PABP in facilitating mRNA biogenesis and export (14). The mechanism of protein synthesis and the macromolecules needed are very similar in yeast, animal, and plant cells (15). In the cytoplasm, PABP associates with both the mRNA poly (A)-tail and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G

These associations stimulate eIF4A helicase activity (17), promote eIF4E to interact with the 5-m7GpppX cap structure (18), and, along with eIF4B (19, 20), increase PABP affinity for the poly (A)-tail on mRNA (19). The synergistic interactions between these proteins are thought to enhance translation by stabilizing the mRNP complex and promoting ribosomal recruitment (21). Simultaneous binding of the initiation factors to PABP loops the mRNA transcript and brings the mRNA 5- and 3-termini into close proximity (22). Circularization of mRNA further enhances translation by allowing terminating ribosomes to cycle on the same mRNA transcript (23). A notable difference in plant systems is the presence of an eIF4F isoform (eIFiso4F) (24). This complex, is composed of eIFiso4G, which also interacts with wheat PABP, and eIFiso4E, which can bind to 5-capped mRNA (19). eIF4F and eIFiso4F isoforms have evolved to discriminate between nonstandard mRNA, that is, those containing a structured 5-leader or multiple cistrons, and standard transcripts in plants, respectively (25). The structure of PABP is highly conserved (26, 27). It is a modular protein consisting of an N-terminal region with four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal region containing a peptide-binding module referred to as the PABC domain. Each RRM possess a canonical RNA binding fold of four stranded antiparallel -sheets backed by two R-helices (28). The central two -strands contact RNA while the R-helical face and RRM linker regions provide interaction sites for proteins such as eIF4B (19, 20), eIF4G (29), DAZL (30), PABP-interacting proteins (Paip)-1 (31) and -2 (32), cleavage factor IA (6), Rna15p (5), and yeast export and import factors (8, 9). The PABC domain does not contact RNA, but serves as an additional binding surface for proteins. These include Paip-1, Paip-2, and eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3). Through its association with PABP, Paip-1 and Paip-2, stimulate (33) and down-regulate (32) protein translation, respectively. Both proteins contain two independent motifs that contact PABP, referred to as PABP-interacting motifs (PAM)-1 and -2 (31). The PAM-1 motif is an acidic sequence, which interacts with the N-terminal RRMs, whereas PAM-2 interacts with the PABC domain. Mammalian eRF3 contains a PAM-2 motif within its N-terminus and plays a role in ribosome release (34). Over the past few years, structures of the PABC domain from human (35, 36), S. cereVisiae (27), and Trypanasoma cruzi (37) have been solved. These domains are R-helical in nature and adopt a right-handed super coil fold. The structures of human PABC complexes with Paip-1 and Paip-2 show that the conserved 15-residue PAM-2 sequence is necessary and sufficient for binding (38). Although PABCs share high sequence similarity, at least 42% across species, structural differences exist most notably between human and yeast PABCs (27, 35, 36). These differences are responsible for the lower binding affinity of yPABC to PAM-2 sequences and suggest an alternative PABC binding motif in yeast (27). Here, we report the solution structure of the PABC domain from wheat PABP and characterize its interaction with the plant PAM-2 sequence via NMR spectroscopy and isothermal calorimetry. Wheat PABC (wPABC) binds to the plant PAM-2 motif with high affinity and shows a structure and

Siddiqui et al. peptide recognition mechanism analogous to that of human PABC. A bioinformatic analysis of wheat and other plant sequence databases identified several novel proteins containing PAM-2 sequences with putative roles in either RNA metabolic or translational regulatory pathways. The plant proteins identified have no metazoan homologues but are found throughout plant species. These results suggest a conserved role for these proteins and implicate them as potential plant PABP binding partners. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Construct Design and Protein Sample Preparation. On the basis of previous studies with the human PABC domain (35), a primary sequence alignment between human (NCBI accession number: AAH15958) and wheat PABP (NCBI: AAB38974) indicated that the wheat PABC domain resides between residues Y535 and S651. Accordingly, this site was amplified by PCR and cloned into a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion vector. This construct was produced as an unlabeled, 15N, or 15N/13C isotopically labeled GST-fusion protein using the pGEX-2TK vector system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein expression was completed as described previously (37). The recombinant protein, wPABC1, was isolated by affinity chromatography using Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was eluted with the addition of 20 mM reduced glutathione in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer at pH 7.1 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with thrombin protease (2 units/mg fusion protein, Amersham Biosciences). Further purification was done with an HPLC gel filtration column (Superdex 75HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) using 1× PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min to separate cleaved GST, thrombin protease, and other impurities from the target sample. Characterization by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of a 13.7 kDa protein consisting of 129 residues, which included 12 additional N-terminal residues encoded by the expression vector. For NMR analysis, the purified sample was exchanged into an NMR buffer (50 mM NaHPO3, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaN3, and 10% D2O at pH 6.3) and concentrated by centrifugation (Amicon, MWCO 5000 kDa). The final protein concentrations in NMR samples were between 1 and 2 mM. Our initial NMR experiments demonstrated that the wPABC1 construct contains unstructured regions at both the N- and C-termini (discussed in the Results section). Consequently, a second construct was made to include only the structured region. A PCR fragment corresponding to the structured region was amplified using the first construct as the template and oligos wPC-5F: 5-CACAGGGATCCCCAATTGGGGCATTGG-3 and wPC-3R 5-CACTCTCGAGTTAGGAAGAGATGAGGC-3 (restriction sites are underlined). The product was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of a pGEX-6P1 GST-fusion vector (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA sequence of the new construct wPABC2 residues (P552-S634) was verified by capillary electrophoresis-based sequencing using the Molecular Dynamics MegaBACE 500 system (Sheldon Biotech). The wPABC2 sample was prepared as described above, but PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) was used to cleave the recombinant protein from the GST-tag. Characterization of wPABC2 by ESI mass spectrometry confirmed

NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR experiments were acquired at 303 K using standard double and triple resonance techniques on 15N- or 15N,13C-labeled samples (39). Experiments were done on Bruker DRX 600 MHz and Varian Unity Inova 800 MHz spectrometers. NMR spectra were processed using NMR Pipe/NMR Draw (40). Evaluation of spectra and manual assignments were completed with XEASY software (41). Sequential backbone and side chain assignments were determined using HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH (42, 43), 2D homonuclear TOCSY, and 3D 15N-edited TOCSY. Distance restraints were derived from a 2D homonulcear NOESY and 3D 15N-edited NOESY. 15N-1H hNOE experiments were acquired at 600 MHz in an interleaved manner with a recycle delay of 4 s (44). Values were measured by taking the ratio of peak intensities from experiments performed with and without 1H presaturation. Saturation was achieved using a train of 120° pulses separated by 5 ms for a total irradiation time of 3 s. Peptide Synthesis, Purification, and Titration Experiments by NMR. A region corresponding to a PAM-2 motif found in wheat (TIGR TC251957) 16-SLNPNAVEFVPSCLRS31 was synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reversephase chromatography on a Vydac C18 column (Sheldon Biotechnology Center). The composition and purity of the peptide was verified by ion-spray quadropole mass spectroscopy. NMR titrations were carried out by adding aliquots of unlabeled wPAM2 peptide to an 15N-labeled wPABC sample until saturation was achieved. Signals were monitored by observing the change in chemical shifts of amide signals (((1H ppm)2 + (15N ppm × 0.2)2)0.5) on HSQC spectra. HNCACB and CBCACONH experiments were carried out for backbone reassignment of wPABC in a 1:1 complex with PAM-2. Isothermal Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements. Experiments were carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC titration calorimeter using VPViewer software for data acquisition and instrument control (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). NMR buffer (as described above) was used for ITC experiments. A degassed sample of wPABC thermostated at the desired temperature (15 °C) and was stirred (310 rpm) in a reaction cell of 1.4 mL. Titrations were carried out using a 296 µL syringe filled with the peptide solution. Thirty-seven injections at 8 µL of peptide were added to the sample with a 5-min interval between injections. Heat transfer (µcal/s) was measured as a function of elapsed time. The experiments were performed with 50 µM wPABC solution in the cell and 500 µM peptide solution in the syringe to ensure a final peptide/protein molar ratio of 2:1 in the reaction cell. The binding constants and thermodynamic parameters were determined as described earlier (38). Analysis of NMR Data and Structure Calculation. A set of unambiguous NOE restraints were extracted from the NOESY spectra and used in conjunction with dihedral angle restraints to generate a preliminary fold of wPABC using CNS 1.1 (45). The resulting structures were used as a model template for automated assignments by ARIA 1.1 (46). The final 3D structure of wPABC was calculated using standard molecular dynamics protocols in CNS 1.1 with a total set of

1148 restraints (Table 1) collected from the experiments described above. In the final round of calculations, only unambiguous restraints were used. CNS 1.1 was extended to incorporate dihedral angle and hydrogen bond restraints (47) for further refinement. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were obtained from the average values predicted by TALOS (48). Hydrogen bond restraints were determined from NOE patterns and expectations for helical residues. Fifteen structures were selected to represent the final ensemble on the basis of lowest energy and best fit to experimental restraints. PROCHECK-NMR was used to generate Ramachandran plots to check the protein's stereochemical geometry (49). The coordinates of wheat PABC have been deposited in the RCSB under PDB accession code 2DYD and the NMR assignments under BMRB accession number 15087. Bioinformatics. Proteins containing the PAM-2 motif were identified through a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) (50) at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) using the search for the "short nearly exact match" option. The input was a consensus PAM-2 sequence (-LNP-AEFVP-), and the search limited to Viridiplantae. Default parameters were selected including a PAM30 matrix, which evaluates the quality of pairwise sequence alignment. Domain architecture of the identified proteins was found at the NCBI conserved domain database (51) and simple modular architecture research tools (SMART) (52). Wheat proteins were searched for in The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) databases using the BLAST search option (http://tigrblast.

A 15N-1H HSQC experiment was performed on a uniformly 15N-labeled sample corresponding to the C-terminal region of wheat PABP (NCBI AAB38974; Y535-S651). The HSQC spectrum for this construct (Figure 1a) displayed excellent signal dispersion and a total of 118 out of 129 amide-proton signals were observed. Chemical shifts were not observed for the 9 prolines or amides with significant overlap. HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH experiments were performed on a 13C/15N labeled sample to obtain sequential backbone assignments. To acquire dynamic information and determine the unstructured regions of the protein, 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments (hNOE) were performed. This experiment detects 15N-1H vector reorientational dynamics and is used to assess the motion of the protein backbone at the nano- to pico-second time scale. Negative hNOE values, which indicate regions of high flexibility, were found at the N-terminus (residues Y535S551) and the C-terminus (residues H630-S651) (Figure 1b). Given this information, DNA primers were designed accordingly to eliminate the unstructured sections of the protein. The new construct corresponding to the structured region of wheat PABC (P552-S634) was prepared as an isotopically labeled recombinant protein for further structural studies by NMR spectroscopy and thermodynamic studies by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Sequence and Structure Comparison of Wheat PABC. Over 90% of backbone and side chain resonances were determined for 1H and 15N, and over 1100 restraints were used to calculate its structure (Table 1). The ensemble consisting of 15 least violated structures is shown in Figure 2a with the ribbon diagram in Figure 2b. This ensemble has a backbone root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.465 ( 0.17 Å for regions (N562-S626). The wPABC domain is a monomer principally consisting of four R-helices (residues E566V580, Q587-L595, Q600-L606, D611-R625) that fold into a well-defined compact structure. Similar to T. cruzi PABC (37), there is a short N-terminal helix (A557-A559)

that does not pack against the protein. However, the hNOE values of this region are only slightly lower than the rest of the protein, indicating that this region is ordered. Even though long-range NOEs could not be found within this region, it is plausible that this N-terminal helix could be packed, as observed in human PABC, within the full PABP protein in T. cruzi and wheat. Nevertheless, the 3D arrangement of the last four R-helices share structural similarities that are closer to that of T. cruzi and human than that of yPABC (Figure 2). The primary sequences of PABC domains are highly conserved across plant species. wPABC shares at minimum 54% sequence identity and 72% similarity with other plant PABCs (Figure 3). Importantly, the residues that build the hydrophobic core and account for the major stabilization force within the wPABC structure (such as L572, L576, V580, A588, V591, L596, L597, V603, L606, L613, and V617) are highly conserved throughout plant PABPs. From this observation, one can predict that the structures of the PABC domains from other plant PABPs will be similar to the domain from wheat. In general, the largest variations within PABC structures across kingdoms are found at the N-terminus, which corresponds with the region with lowest sequence similarity (Figure 3). Only, hPABC contains an extra N-terminal R-helix that is tightly packed in the domain (35). The PABC domains from HYD and yeast PABP only contain four R-helices. The extra N-terminal helix in hPABC (NCBI NP002559; residues L544-A552) is dispensable as a shortened fragment and gives a 15N-1H HSQC spectrum similar to that of the full length domain (27). In addition, the mutant R1-hPABC (residues 554-636) can bind to Paip-2 with affinities comparable to that of the wild type domain (data not shown). PABC from HYD and TcPABP also has specificity and affinity to the PAM-2 motif similar to that of human PABP. Overall, this indicates that the last four helices are sufficient for sequence recognition. Furthermore, the extra N-terminal helix in animal, trypanosome, and plant species suggest a function independent of peptide recognition. Another notable structural difference in yeast PABC is a strong bend found exclusively within its Cterminal helix. This difference appears to be responsible for the significantly lower affinity for known PAM-2 sequences.

wPABC. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were completed to determine the thermodynamic parameters for wPABC-PAM2 binding. The titration of wPABC with peptide resulted in negative deflections from the baseline, which is indicative of an exothermic reaction (Figure 5c). The heat of release allowed for measurements of the enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of binding. The

FIGURE 4: Identification of wheat proteins containing the PAM-2 site. (a) Human Paip-1 and Paip-2 both contain a stretch of acidic residues that interact with the N-terminal RRM region of PABP (referred to as PABP-interacting motif-1, PAM-1).

interaction is dominated by favorable enthalpic effects (H ) -7.1 kCal/mol), which give rise to heat release upon binding. The slightly positive entropy (S ) 0.174 kCal K-1/ mol) indicates that desolvation effects most likely dominate conformational ordering upon complex formation. Assuming a 1:1 binding model, the ITC measurements yielded a Kd value of 3.0 µM, indicating a reasonably strong affinity between the peptide and protein. Our measured Kd and thermodynamic profile are comparable with previous binding studies observed between hPABC and peptides derived from human Paip-1, Paip-2, and RF3 (38). Because each of these proteins was demonstrated to interact with PABP in ViVo (31, 32, 54), the measured affinities in the low micromolar range can be considered physiologically relevant. The peptide binding site on wPABC was determined by NMR using chemical shift perturbation analysis. A 15N labeled sample of wPABC was titrated with the unlabeled peptide, and residues showing chemical shift changes were monitored on a 15N-1H HSQC spectrum (Figure 5a). The addition of the peptide to the sample (0.2 mM increments, up to a final 2:1 molar ratio) resulted in many amide chemical shifts disappearing and re-appearing at different positions of the spectra. This observation of slow exchange on the NMR time scale is indicative of high affinity binding to the peptide. HNCACB and CBCACONH experiments were carried out for the reassignment of the backbone resonances of wPABC in a 1:1 complex with PAM-2. A comparison of amide signals obtained from 15N-1H HSQC spectra with and without the peptide displays residues M571 (0.427 ppm), E574 (0.711 ppm), Y577 (0.428 ppm), K590 (0.493 ppm), M594 (0.776 ppm), L595 (0.578 ppm), E619 (0.509 ppm), A620 (0.693 ppm), M621 (0.986 ppm), and V623 (0.447 ppm) having the largest change chemical shift changes upon binding (Figure 5b). They reside on helices R2, R3, and R5 and define the peptide binding pocket for wPABC (Figure 5d). wPABC binds peptides in a manner highly analogous to that of human and trypanosome PABC (35, 37). The

peptide binding residues are completely conserved throughout plant PABPs, indicating that all share a comparable peptide recognition mechanism (Figure 3). Bioinformatic SurVey of Plant PAM-2 Proteins. Recently, new plant PABP-interacting proteins were identified in ViVo in both Cucumis satiVus (55) and Arabidopsis thaliana (56). These proteins bind specifically to the PABC domain from PABP. Through primary sequence alignments, a PAM-2 site highly similar to the metazoan PAM-2 motif was identified (55). The PAM-2 sequence found in A. thaliana and C. satiVus was used as a query to search the wheat genomic database. Eight distinct proteins were identified (Table 2), seven of which have homologues in other monocot (T. aeVestium, O. satiVa, and C. satiVus) and dicot species (N. tabacum and A. thaliana). Aside from the early response to dehydration protein (ERD-15), the remaining proteins have not been characterized. However, all have conserved domains that give insight into their possible functions. The plant PAM-2 motif proteins can be divided into five categories on the basis of the presence of an acid-rich PAM-1-like region, RRM domains, SMR endonuclease domains, eIF3like/tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), or a Pbp1p/Lsm homology region (Figure 4). There are two genes that contain an acid-rich PAM-1like motif. The first is an early response to dehydration protein (ERD-15) (TC265113), which belongs to a class of genes activated in response to various stresses (57). For example, in A. thaliana, the ERD-15 expression level increases upon exposure to drought, low temperatures, and high light intensity (58). In C. satiVus, a distinct diurnal pattern of PCI6/ERD gene expression was observed where transcript levels increased throughout the day and declined overnight (55). Homologues of this gene are found in both monocot and dicot species (Table 2) with high conservation in the first 60-65 residues (55, 57). The N-terminal segment contains a PAM-2 motif, and site-directed mutagenesis studies confirmed that the motif was necessary for interacting

with the C-terminal domain of PABP (55). Furthermore, ERD/PCI6 from C. satiVus down-regulates translation through PABP interaction in Vitro (55). Because the ERD-15 family has a short region of acidic residues, similar to the PAM-1 motif, following the conserved N-terminal region (TC265113, Figure 4), it is plausible that the mechanism of its effect on translation is similar to that of Paip-2 (23). The acidic PAM-1 region in Paip-2 is proposed to disrupt PABP's affinity for the poly (A)-tail (32). Another small wheat protein (TC238656) also contains both a PAM-2 motif followed by an Asp/Glurich stretch. However, this protein is distinct from ERD-15 and shares no sequence similarity with Paip-2. Two PAM-2-containing RNA binding proteins (RNBP A and B) are found in wheat (TC246947 and TC266478) and other plant species (Table 2). Although these RNA binding proteins have yet to be fully characterized, a homologue in A. thaliana was shown to be expressed during embryogenesis and in growing organs, suggesting a role in plant development (59). This group of proteins consists of 350 residues including a PAM-2 site at the N-terminal followed by two RNA recognition motifs. The two RRMs share the highest similarity (SMART 00360) to those found in the human U2

small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (sRNP) auxiliary factor (hU2AF) (60). U2AF associates with the 3-site early in pre-mRNA splicing and recognizes additional splicing factors (61). The idea of PABP involvement in mRNA splicing is not surprising because yeast PABP associates with subunits of the cleavage factors IA (5, 6). Cleavage factors also cooperate with splicing factors for polyadenylation control and couple splicing with polyadenylation (62). In addition, in mammalian cells, PABP associates with the poly (A)-tail of unspliced pre-mRNA and is suggested to be involved in pre-mRNA processing (10). Wheat contains a 670 residue protein (TC247565) that shares significant similarity to the C-terminal region of a p135 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3, which also contains TPR repeats. TPR is an antiparallel R-helical protein interaction domain present in a wide range of proteins involved in transcription, cell cycle control, protein folding, and protein transport (63). eIF3 binds to eIF4G and to the 40S ribosomal subunit to promote the binding of initiator methionyl-tRNA and mRNA (64). Recent studies show that PABP plays a direct role in ribosomal joining and increases its efficiency in initiation complex formation (21). Hence, a

putative function of the PAM-2 motif in plant eIF3-like/TPR proteins is to modulate translation by interacting with PABP during translation initiation. The fourth set of plant proteins (TC251957 and TC252881) contains an N-terminal PAM-2 motif followed by a Cterminal region simliar to that of the human BCL-3 binding protein (hBCL3-BP). Both proteins share in common a small MutS related domain (Smr). The Smr domain is an endonuclease conserved in bacterial MutS2 proteins and is involved in the DNA damage repair system (65). Similarly, the Smr domain in hBCL3-BP contains nicking endonuclease activity and is possibly involved in coupling transcription with DNA repair or recombination (66). However, the function of this domain has not been fully established in eukaryotes (67). The final wheat protein (TC238656), found in rice and A. thaliana, contains a nucleic acid binding Sm-like motif (Lsm). Sm/Lsm proteins are a widespread protein family (68) that participate in mRNA related metabolic processes, such as pre-mRNA splicing (69), mRNA decapping and degradation (70), and small nucleolar RNP assembly (71). The Lsm motif is also found in two other PABP binding proteins: metazoan ataxin-2 (72) and yeast Pbp1p (73). Polyglutamine expansion in Ataxin-2 is responsible for the human disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (74). This protein contains a PAM-2 motif, and recent work has confirmed the in ViVo interaction between Ataxin-2 and PABP and its role in regulating translation (72). Yeast Pbp1p also interacts with the C-terminal domain of PABP but through binding to a region outside of the PABC domain. Pbp1p functions to

prevent the association of PABP with poly (A)-nuclease and controls mRNA polyadenylation (73). DISCUSSION Typically, only one gene encoding PABP is found in single cell eukaryotes, whereas multiple copies are found in metazoans and plant species. Humans have three functional genes for cytosolic PABPs, whereas the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana contains eight (75). In A. thaliana, two of the eight PABP genes only encode four RRM domains. Another dicot, N. tabacum, has three expressed PABP genes but only one has four RRMs. The other two contain only one or two RRMs; all contain PABC domains. Although detailed expression data for PABP in the monocot O. satiVa are not available, the number of PABP genes and tissue distribution and abundance follow the same pattern observed in A. thaliana (75). The additional genes for PABPs in plants are organ specific and were proposed to have evolved for specialized functions in translation or mRNA metabolism (26, 76-78). Their unique functions are likely due to sequence differences in the RRM region. In contrast, the region corresponding to the PABC of plant PABPs displays little primary sequence diversity, indicating a specific and conserved function. This includes PABPs from chloroplasts (C. reinhardtii), monocots (O. satiVa and T. aeVestium), dicots (N. tabacum and A. thaliana), and ferns (A. philitidis). In this article, we found that wheat PABC possesses a structure and peptide binding function very similar to those of the domain from human PABP (Figure 5c). Both recognize a very similar 15 residue sequence

Structure of PABC from Triticum aeVestium PABP (PAM-2 motif). From the conservation of key residues responsible for maintaining protein fold and peptide specificity identified from wheat, we predict that all plant PABCs will have similar functional characteristics. This is supported by recent work, which shows that PAB2 and PAB5 from A. thaliana interact in ViVo with multiple proteins containing a PAM-2 sequence (56). Furthermore, other work has demonstrated that mutating key residues in the PAM-2 site of C. satiVus proteins diminishes or abolishes its interaction with PABP (55). From an evolutionary point of view, this suggests that the structure and function of PABCs evolved prior to the divergence of plant and animal kingdoms and have generally remained preserved over time. A notable exception is the PABC of PAB7 from A. thaliana, which has a histidine (H534) in place of the aromatic tyrosine (Y577, in wheat) (Figure 4). According to the human PABC-PAM2 complex and the wPABC structure reported here, the analogous residue F22 (Figure 5c) is the single most important factor contributing to peptide binding (38). Consequently, we predict that the affinity of A. thaliana PAB7 for the PAM-2 motif will be considerably reduced. This may have consequences for the regulation of PABP function in A. thaliana. Cross-complementation studies of A. thaliana PAB2, 3, and 5 with yeast PABP null mutants show that all can restore viability (11-13); however, similar experiments have not been performed with PAB7. The same studies also show that only certain functions of yeast PABP can be complimented. Only yeast PABC contains differences in structure and sequence specificity (27). Hence, the differences between the PABC from plants and yeast may be responsible for this partial complementation of Arabidopsis PABP in yeast. Thus far, only a limited set of PABC-interacting proteins have been characterized in ViVo. In yeast, the PAN3-PABC interaction in the nucleus is necessary for modifying the 3 poly (A)-tail to a specific length, which is required for efficient mRNA export (7, 9). The interactions between Paip1, Paip-2, and RF3 have been well characterized in metazoans. Recent work has also verified the in ViVo interaction between ataxin-2 (74) and the anti-proliferative protein Tob2 (79). Sequence homologues for the metazoan and yeast PABC binding proteins are currently not known in plant species. The only functional characterization of a plant PAM-2 protein is ERD/PCI6 from C. satiVus, which down regulates PABP-dependent translation in Vitro (55). Other evidence has provided support of PABC's importance in translation regulation in plants. For example, the zucchini mosaic potyvirus RNA dependent DNA polymerase (RdRp) directly targets the C. satiVus PABC in PABP to modulate host translation to promote viral replication (80). Comparable strategies are also seen with viruses infecting mammalian systems. For instance, HIV (81) and Caliciviruses (82) both encode proteases that specifically separate the RRM regions from PABC to induce host translational shutoff. Together, these observations suggest that the regulatory effects of translation via PABC are conserved in both animal and plant species. A bioinformatic review of the plant sequence database identifies several proteins containing PAM-2 sequences. These PABC-interacting proteins contain a diverse range of modules that implicate their function in translation or mRNA metabolic pathways. Furthermore, recent studies in A.

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 14, 2007 4229 thaliana show that these PAM-2 homologues are ubiquitously expressed and interact with PABP in ViVo (56). Importantly, they are conserved throughout plant species, implying a significant role for these proteins. From previous biochemical data established in other species, we can propose that their function will be to regulate gene expression by affecting PABP-dependent mRNA or translation-related processes. Intriguingly, these plant PAM-2 proteins have no metazoan sequence homologues. This suggests that PABC binding proteins have evolved separately but have developed converging function in regulating PABP. Overall, our observations indicate that plants have evolved a distinct regulatory mechanism for PABP-dependent gene expression. Although hypothetical, these predictions serve as a basis for further experiments and provide insight into plant RNA metabolic and translational regulatory pathways.
