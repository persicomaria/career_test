Abstract Representatives of three types of feruloyl esterases were examined for their ability to release mono- and di-meric ferulic acid from waterextractable and water-unextractable cereal cell wall material, either alone or in the presence of a family 10 or family 11 xylanase. A type-C feruloyl esterase from Talaromyces stipitatus (TsFaeC) released 100% of the ferulic acid from water-extractable wheat endosperm arabinoxylan when acting in combination with a xylanase from Trichoderma longibrachiatum. The type-A esterase from Aspergillus niger, AnFaeA, was most effective in releasing ferulic acid from wheat bran and brewers' spent grain, with over 50% of the available ferulic acid being released from wheat bran in the presence of a xylanase from Bacillus subtilis. In general, family 11 xylanases were the preferred synergistic partners with feruloyl esterases for the release of ferulic acid, while family 10 xylanases were preferred for the liberation of diferulic acid, with only the 5,50 form being released by the action of AnFaeA alone. This suggests that ferulic acid may be located in regions of low substitution on arabinoxylans while the 5,50 diferulate moiety is located in more branched regions of the xylan chain. q 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A wheat grain can be split mechanically into two main carbohydrate-containing fractions, the inner endosperm and the outer bran layers. Wheat endosperm, commonly referred to as flour, contains 2 ­ 3% cell wall material (Gruppen et al., 1989). The cell wall components are mainly arabinoxylans (AX: 1.5 ­2.5% of wheat flour) with a linear backbone of (1 ! 4)-linked b-D -xylopyranosyl units, of which up to 50% are substituted either at the O-2, O-3 or both positions by a-L -arabinofuranosyl units. Wheat AX can be classified into two types. One-third being easily extractable in water (WEAX), and is of higher molecular weight (Rouau, 1993). The remainder is water-unextractable (WUAX), and can be further subdivided into

Based on Garcia-Conesa and co-workers (Kroon et al., 1999; Crepin, 2003). Methyl esters of ferulic (MFA), sinapic (MSA), caffeic (MCA) and p-coumaric acids (MpCA) were used to determine the specificity of feruloyl esterases for substitutions around the phenolic moiety (Kroon et al., 1997) Feruloyl esterase type Hydrolysis of methyl esters of: A MFA MSA B MFA MCA MpCA No N. crassa Fae-1 P. funiculosum FaeB C MFA MCA MSA MpCA No Tal. stipitatus FaeC A. niger FaeB D MFA MSA MCA MpCA Yes (5,50 ) P. funiculosum FaeA Pir. equi EstA

alkali/enzyme-extractable AX and residual unextractable AX (Courtin and Delcour, 2002). The failure to extract all of arabinoxylan from cereal cell walls with water is probably due to a combination of non-covalent interactions and covalent bonding with neighbouring AX molecules and other wall components, such as protein, cellulose and lignin (Iiyama et al., 1994). Alkali-extractable AX, having more contiguous unsubstituted xylose and more monosubstituted xylose residues is more easily degraded enzymatically than WEAX (Gruppen et al., 1993; Izydorczyk and Biliaderis, 1995). Compared to wheat AX, barley arabinoxylan appears to be more structurally uniform, where substituted residues are more clustered and separ¨ ated by regions of unsubstituted xylosyl units (Vietor et al., 1991). Arabinose substitution along the backbone is not ¨ random (Gruppen et al., 1993; Vietor et al., 1991). Some of the arabinose residues on the xylan backbone are further esterified to ferulic and diferulic acids, a feature of arabinoxylans in cereals and grasses, and several other families of moncotyledons (Izydorczyk and Biliaderis, 1995; Geissman and Neukom, 1973; Mueller-Harvey et al., 1986). In wheat endosperm, ferulic acid (FA) is confined mostly to the high molecular weight fractions of WEAX, which also show the lowest degrees of arabinose substitution (Izydorczyk and Biliaderis, 1993). The cereal processing industry, which includes milling, breadmaking and brewing, produces high levels of AX-rich wall material as co-products, such as wheat bran and brewers' spent grain (BSG). Wheat bran consists of different tissues comprising the outer layers of the wheat grain. Wheat bran AX is thus very heterogeneous; consisting primarily of a population of AX, with an arabinose:xylose ratio of 0.2 i.e. low substitution, and a less-abundant, highlysubstituted population with a 1.0 ratio (Dupont and Selvendran, 1987; Schooneveld-Bergmans et al., 1999). The bran AXs are both water-extractable and waterunextractable. BSG contains 25% protein and 38% AX on a dry matter basis (Valverde, 1994). The AX is mostly water-unextractable, the germinated grain having already been through a hot-water extraction process to produce the wort for beer.

Arabinoxylans can be degraded by a range of microbial and plant hydrolases, including (1 ! 4)-b-D -xylopyranosidases, a-L -arabinofuranosidases, acetyl and feruloyl esterases and a- D -glucuronosidases. Xylanases (E.C.3.2.1.8) belong to two main groups based on their primary sequence and structure (http://afmb.crns-mrs.fr/ ~cazy/CAZY/) (Coutinho and Henrissat, 1999). Family 11 xylanases preferentially cleave in unsubstituted regions of the AX backbone, whereas family 10 xylanases cleave in decorated regions (Biely et al., 1997). Generally, branching on the xylan is believed to impede xylan degradation (Debeire et al., 1990) by hindering the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex (Gorbacheva and Rodionova, 1977). On the other hand AXs with low degrees of substitution may associate, rendering the xylan chains less accessible to the hydrolases. Over the last 10 years, enzymes responsible for cleaving the ester-link joining monomeric or dimeric ferulates and arabinosyl substituents on AXs have been identified in fungi, bacteria and cereals (Williamson et al., 1998; Sancho et al., 1999; Bonnin et al., 2000). Feruloyl esterases (E.C. 3.1.1.73) have been disposed into four classes based on their specificity towards mono- and diferulates and for substitutions on the phenolic ring (Table 1) (Kroon et al., 1999; Crepin, 2003). These enzymes work in synergy with xylanases to release ferulic acid from wall material (Faulds and Williamson, ´ 1995; Bartolome et al., 1995). In the present study, we have examined the specificity of feruloyl esterases belonging to three of the four sub-groups for their ability to act on, and specificity for, water-extractable and water-unextractable feruloylated polymers from cereals, either alone or in the presence of xylanases of family 10 or family 11. The possible role of these feruloyl esterases in breadmaking and cereal co-product utilisation is discussed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials WEAX and WUAX were extracted from wheat flour (var. Soisson) by the dough-washing procedure as described

by Rouau and Moreau (1993). After isolation, samples were freeze-dried and analysed for neutral sugar and phenolic acids (Blakeney et al., 1983; Selvendrain and O'Neill, 1987; Waldron et al., 1996). The xylose:arabinose ratio of WEAX was calculated to be 1.77:1, and 2.08:1 for WUAX. BSG (malt:maize (80:20, w/w)) was provided by Mahou SA (Madrid, Spain). Material was oven dried at 60 8C for 18 h. BSG was milled to a fine powder of particle size less than 50 mm. Commercial de-starched wheat bran (DSWB) was obtained from Agro-industrie Recherches et Developpements (Pomacle, France). Recombinant feruloyl esterases from Aspergillus niger (AnFaeA), Neurospora crassa (NcFae-1) and wild-type feruloyl esterase from Talaromyces stipitatus (TsFaeC) were obtained as previously described (Crepin, 2003; Juge et al., 2001; Crepin et al., 2003). Xylanases from Trichoderma viride (M1), T. longibrachiatum (pI 5.5, M2) and T. longbrachiatum (pI 9.0, M3) were purchased from Megazyme International (Co. Wicklow, Ireland). Recombinant A. niger xylanase XynA (Hessing et al., 1994; Berrin et al., 2000) was a kind gift from Tariq Tahir (IFR). A. oryzae xylanases (Bailey et al., 1991) pI 4.9 and 6.9 were kindly donated by Dr Maija Tenkanen (University of Helsinki), Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa XynA (Hall et al., 1989) from Professor Harry Gilbert (University of Newcastle), Fibrobacter succinogenes xylanase domain B (Zhu et al., 1994; Marrone et al., 2000) from Dr Anthony Clarke (University of Guelph, Canada), Aspergillus aculeatus xylanase and Bacillus subtilis xylanase (Courtin and Delcour, 2001) from Dr Jan Delcour (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium). 2.2. Enzyme activity Feruloyl esterase activity was determined against methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids using the HPLC assay method of Juge et al. (2001). One unit of esterase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 mmol hydroxycinnamic acid min/mg protein at 37 8C, pH 6.0. Enzymatic release of ferulic acid and diferulates from plant cell wall material was determined in 100 mM MOPS buffer (pH 6.0) in a thermostatically controlled rotating incubator (5 rpm, 37 8C). Plant cell wall material (10 mg) was incubated with different amounts and combinations of AnFaeA and xylanase in a final volume of 500 ml for 3 h. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 200 ml of glacial acetic acid. After centrifugation (20,000g, 5 min, 15 8C), samples were filtered through a 0.45 mm filter and 100 ml analysed by HPLC (Waldron et al., 1996). All assays were prepared and analysed in duplicate, with , 1% standard error for each set of results. The amount of phenolic material released was quantified against standard curves. The total alkaliextractable hydroxycinnamate content was determined as described by Hernanz et al. (2001). Xylanase activity against 1% (w/v) wheat arabinoxylan in 10 mM McIlvaine

phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.5, was determined as described in Bailey et al. (1992).

3. Results 3.1. Phenolic acid levels in the wall material To measure the amount of phenolic acid released from cell wall material, the initial amount of these acids in the starting substrates was determined and expressed as total alkali-extractable ferulic and diferulic acid (Table 2). WUAX from wheat endosperm flour contained more phenolic acids (ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and diferulates) than the water-extractable form (WEAX), but the highest levels were found in the bran. Compositional differences were found; bran contains equal quantities of 8-O-40 and 8,50 diferulates, whereas in the endosperm, the 8,50 form is present in the highest proportion. In BSG, higher levels of p-coumaric acid, 8-O-40 diferulate and 8,50 diferulate were present compared to the wheat preparations. Furthermore, the ratio of diferulic and ferulic acid is much greater in wheat bran and BSG than in endosperm-derived AX samples, indicating a much higher level of crosslinking. 3.2. Release of ferulic acid from wheat flour arabinoxylans The three feruloyl esterases used in this study were more active on WEAX than WUAX (Table 3) with TsFaeC performing the best. Between 90 and 100% of the alkaliextractable ferulic acid was released from WEAX by TsFaeC, in combination with all xylanases except that from Trichoderma viride. The best synergy was obtained with the family 11 xylanase (pI 9.0) from T. longibranchiatum, although TsFaeC also worked well alone. AnFaeA was the second most effective feruloyl esterase on WEAX, with ferulic acid release ranging from 64 to 89%, but with this esterase, there was a clear preference to act in conjunction with family 10 xylanases. Of the three esterases examined, NcFae-1 was the least effective. Overall this

esterase was most productive with family 10 xylanases, although the enzyme was most active in synergy with the family 11 xylanase from A. oryzae. With WUAX as substrate the maximum ferulic acid release was 53%, with a combination of AnFaeA and the family 11 xylanases from T. viride or T. longibranchiatum (pI 9.0). However, there was no obvious preference for feruloyl esterases to act synergistically with a particular family of xylanases in releasing ferulic acid from WUAX, as the family 10 xylanases used in this study were more efficient with AnFaeA than several of the other family 11 xylanases. 3.3. Release of diferulate from wheat flour arabinoxylans None of the feruloyl esterases released detectable diferulate from WEAX, and the presence of xylanase was essential for the release of the 5,50 dimer from WUAX (Table 4). AnFaeA was the only feruloyl esterase examined capable of releasing 5,50 diferulate from WUAX. Family 10 xylanases worked better with the esterases in the release of

diferulate than did family 11 enzymes, and the two Aspergillus family 10 xylanases are clearly better than the bacterial enzyme. This synergistic combination appears different from the one required to release monomeric ferulic acid. 3.4. Release of phenolic material from wheat bran and spent grain The synergy between feruloyl esterases and xylanases for the release of ferulic acid and diferulates from wheat bran and BSG was examined under the same conditions used for the wheat endosperm AX substrates (Table 5). In all cases, AnFaeA performed as the best feruloyl esterase on these complex, insoluble, cell wall-rich substrates. With AnFaeA and TsFaeC, more ferulic acid was released from wheat bran than from BSG. NcFae-1 worked better on BSG, but released very small amounts of ferulic acid from wheat bran. All three feruloyl esterases acted effectively with family 11 xylanases, the exception being the pI 6.9 xylanase from

A. oryzae. The xylanase from Bacillus subtilis, acting in concert with AnFaeA facilitated the release half the alkaliextractable ferulic acid from wheat bran and a quarter of the ferulic acid from BSG. Only AnFaeA was able to release diferulates from the water-unextractable wall material, and again, only 5,50 diferulic acid was released (Table 6). The xylanases from T. viride and B. subtilis performed best with AnFaeA in releasing diferulic acid from both substrates. There is a preference for family 11 xylanases for the release of the 5,50 diferulate by AnFaeA, which may suggest that the diferulate is located on relatively unsubstituted regions of the arabinoxylan substrate.

4. Discussion The `heterosynergy' between feruloyl esterases and xylanases is effective in the deconstruction of wheat bran but the source of xylanase used has considerable impact on

´ the rate of ferulic acid release (Bartolome et al., 1995; Petit-Benvegnen et al., 1998). The present study indicates that, not only does the source of xylanase influence the amount of ferulic acid released, but also the type of feruloyl esterase used in conjunction with the xylanase is important (Tables 3­ 6). Feruloyl esterases have been tentatively divided into four types (A, B, C and D) (Kroon et al., 1999; Crepin, 2003) depending on their (i) protein sequence, (ii) specificity towards hydroxycinnamic acid methyl esters, and (iii) ability to release diferulic acids from model and complex substrates (Table 1). In this study we show that feruloyl esterases belonging to different types also act differently on feruloylated polysaccharides, and this may be due to both their substrate specificity and the products of xylanase hydrolysis of the different polysaccharides. For example, AnFaeA, a type-A feruloyl esterase, is more effective on feruloylated trisaccharide, F(5)AXX, derived from wheat bran, than on the mono-, di- and tetrasaccharides, F(5)A, F(5)AX and XF(5)AXX (Faulds et al., 1995). However, the feruloylated trisaccharide, GXF(5)A,

from maize bran was not de-esterified as efficiently due to the presence of galactose in the third sugar position and its possible location as a side chain of the maize bran heteroxylan (Faulds et al., 1995). AnFaeA also did not hydrolyse feruloyl-2-O-arabinofuranose esters, as found in sugar beet pulp, while CinnAE, a type-B feruloyl esterase from A. niger was more efficient on this linkage compared to the feruloyl-5-O-arabinofuranose ester (Williamson et al., 1998). Likewise, the ability of the different xylanases to produce xylo-oligosaccharides from feruloylated polysaccharides will be determined both by the enzyme's specificity and by the location of feruloyl groups within the arabinoxylan chain. The generation of feruloylated oligosaccharides of different length and structure by the different xylanases will contribute to the rate of ferulic acid release by the feruloyl esterases. Generally, branching on the xylan is believed to impede xylan degradation (Debeire et al., 1990; Li et al., 2000), as the substituted groups cause steric hindrance by preventing the enzyme-substrate intermediate to form (Gorbacheva and Rodionova, 1977). As feruloyl groups do not block access of the xylanase to the xylan, compared to arabinose substitutions (Lequart et al., 1999), the activity of the different feruloyl esterases is limited predominantly by the location of the feruloyl groups on the polymer, the conformation of the feruloylated arabinoxylan, and/or the interactions between feruloylated polysaccharides and other wall components. In solution, feruloylated arabinoxylans may adopt a more flexible conformation (Dervilly-Pinel et al., 2001) compared to the stiffer, extended chain of non-feruloylated xylan (Izydorczyk and Biliaderis, 1995; Niedusynski and Marchessault, 1972), and this affects how the arabinoxylans interact with one another (Dervilly et al., 2000). However, there is little information on the effect of arabinoxylan structure on enzyme activity. In WEAX, ferulic acid may be preferentially associated with the heavily substituted regions of the polysaccharide, which explains the efficient release of ferulic acid by the AnFaeA/family 10 xylanase combination. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that TsFaeC can release almost all of the ferulic acid from WEAX in the absence of xylanase, demonstrating its ability to act irrespective of the location of ferulic acid on the polymer. With WUAX, DSWB and BSG, feruloyl esterase/family 11 xylanase combinations were more effective. Compared to wheat AX, barley arabinoxylan appears to be more structurally uniform, with substituted residues being more clustered and separated by ¨ regions of unsubstituted xylosyl units (Vietor et al., 1991). Arabinose substitution along the backbone is not random ¨ (Gruppen et al., 1993; Vietor et al., 1991) and there is a higher proportion of arabinose at the O-2 position compared ¨ that found in wheat AX (Vietor et al., 1991; Han, 2000). Thus, the composition of the feruloylated xylo-oligosaccharides produced by the action of the different xylanases on BSG may differ from that derived from wheat bran, WEAX and WUAX, hence the lower levels of ferulic and diferulic acid released from BSG. If the BSG xylan is either heavily

substituted, acetylated or substituted at the O-2 position instead of the O-3 as in wheat (Kabel et al., 2002a,b), then perhaps the feruloylated fragments released by the action of the xylanases are not of an optimum size or structure, or even feruloylated at the wrong position, for AnFaeA and TsFaeC to act optimally. Enzymatic release of ferulic acid from spent grain also appears to be augmented the action of other glycosyl hydrolases acting on plant cell wall polysaccharides in addition to xylanase, suggesting more complicated interactions between wall polymers in BSG compared to wheat bran (Faulds et al., 2002). The release of diferulates by AnFaeA suggests that 5,50 diferulate groups are located in a region of high substitution on WUAX backbone that is more favourable to hydrolysis by family 10 xylanases, whereas the monomeric ferulate appears to be located in regions of low substitution, hence high release in the presence of family 11 xylanases. No release of diferulate was detected from WEAX, probably due to low initial levels, and any potential release remains undetected by DAD-HPLC. As no other diferulic acid form was detected in the enzymatic hydrolysates, we cannot speculate on their location, even though they are the most abundant forms of diferulate in the substrates examined. Xylanases are not as effective in depolymerising arabinoxylan in situ compared to their action in vitro, since in a system such as a dough matrix, water availability, accessibility to substrate and enzyme mobility is more limited and the polysaccharides are inherently more insoluble (Redgwell et al., 2001). Low levels of diferulic acid together with WUAX may be of considerable significance in the formation of a gel matrix of the dough to improve the water-holding capacity of the arabinoxylan (Rouau et al., 1994). This shows the importance of selecting the correct enzymes for baking e.g. a generally active feruloyl esterase that does not liberate diferulates, such as a type-B or type-C feruloyl esterase (Crepin, 2003), and preliminary data shows that TsFaeC performs better in baking trials than AnFaeA and NcFae-1, resulting in a larger loaf volume (results not shown). WEAX interferes with gluten formation indirectly by cross-linking through ferulic acid leading to higher viscosities, competing for water and thus changing conditions for gluten development (lower gluten yield (GY) and lower maximum resistance to extension ðRmax Þ) (Wang et al., 2002). Extensibility can be related to ferulic acid content of WEAX, as the addition of free FA resulted in a more extensible dough (higher GY). Removal of monomeric feruloyl groups would allow further enzymatic degradation of WEAX, and prevent any unwanted oxidatively formed cross-links. On the other hand, free ferulate can compete with feruloylated arabinoxylan for peroxidase/H2O2, thus preventing direct interference with the formation of the gluten network (Wang et al., 2002; Oudgenoeg et al., 2001). In summary, we have shown that a type-C feruloyl esterase shows a specificity for soluble feruloylated arabinoxylans, while a type-A esterases act more efficiently

with xylanases on water-unextractable wall material. Feruloyl esterases have enhanced activity with family 11 xylanases for the release of monomeric ferulic acid, while family 10 xylanases show preferential activity on diferulates. This may be linked to the location of these esterlinkages on the arabinoxylan chain. Since preliminary results show that type-C feruloyl esterases are effective bread improvers, and are more specific for WEAX, the role of water-extractable arabinoxylans in the process may require re-examination.
