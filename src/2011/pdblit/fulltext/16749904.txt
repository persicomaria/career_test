multivesicular appearance, the multivesicular bodies (MVB), which serve as an intermediate compartment in several intracellular trafficking pathways (1,2). Endocytosis of plasma membrane receptors leads to their delivery to early endosomes. They are subsequently either segregated into receptors that return to the cell surface via recycling endosomes (3) or down regulated, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, and sorted into MVB that are destined for late endosomes and lysosomes (1,2). The biogenesis of MVB involves membrane invagination processes leading to small vesicles that pinch off into the lumen of the endosome. In yeast, class E vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) proteins were first described as being required for MVB biogenesis as the functional loss of any class E Vps protein leads to aberrant late endosomal/MVB structures known as the class E compartment (1,4). The endosomal sorting system is highly conserved from yeast to mammals, and most components as well as their intricate network of interactions have been reported. A first step in sorting includes cargo ubiquitinylation (5À8) and recognition by the Vps27p/Hse-1p or STAM/HRS complex (9À11). The latter interaction leads to the sequential recruitment of three endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-I, -II, -III). ESCRT-I is composed of Vps23, Vps28 and Vps37 that form an approximate 350 kDa large multiprotein complex (12À17). ESCRT-I then induces assembly of ESCRT-II (18À20) and ESCRT-III (21). Deubiquitinylation and disassembly of ESCRT complexes by the AAA-type ATPase Vps4 are finally required for vesicle budding and normal MVB biogenesis (21À24). A number of recent studies have shown that many enveloped viruses, including retroviruses, hijack selective members of the Vps machinery to bud from the host (25,26). Briefly, viral matrix or Gag proteins contain short sequence motifs, which have been termed late domains, that interact with Tsg101 (ESCRT-I), Alix or Hect domain containing ubiquitin ligases (27À34). It is not yet clear whether all Vps components are required for virus budding, although a number of studies indicate a role for at least ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III, including Vps4 (14,15,28,32,33,35). Here, we present a crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of Vps28, which is characterized by a highsequence conservation throughout all kingdoms of life. Vps28-CTD forms an independently folded four-helical 1007

The endosomal sorting complex I required for transport (ESCRT-I) is composed of the three subunits Vps23/ Tsg101, Vps28 and Vps37. ESCRT-I is recruited to cellular membranes during multivesicular endosome biogenesis and by enveloped viruses such as HIV-1 to mediate budding from the cell. Here, we describe the crystal structure of a conserved C-terminal domain from Sacharomyces ° cerevisiae Vps28 (Vps28-CTD) at 3.05 A resolution which folds independently into a four-helical bundle structure. Co-expression experiments of Vps28-CTD, Vps23 and Vps37 suggest that Vps28-CTD does not directly participate in ESCRT-I assembly and may thus act as an adaptor module for downstream interaction partners. We show through mutagenesis studies that Vps28-CTD employs its strictly conserved surface in the interaction with the ESCRT-III factor Vps20. Furthermore, we present evidence that Vps28-CTD is sufficient to rescue an equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) Gag late domain deletion. Vps28-CTD mutations abolishing Vps20 interaction in vitro also prevent the rescue of the EIAV Gag late domain mutant consistent with a potential direct Vps28-ESCRT-III Vps20 recruitment. Therefore, the physiological relevant EIAV Gag­Alix interaction can be functionally replaced by a Gag-Vps28-CTD fusion. Because both Alix and Vps28-CTD can directly recruit ESCRT-III proteins, ESCRT-III assembly coupled to Vps4 action may therefore constitute the minimal budding machinery for EIAV release.

bundle and serves as an adaptor module linked to the ESCRT-I complex that connects its function to other components of the Vps machinery, including ESCRT-III Vps20. Our data suggest that such an interaction is sufficient and serves as an alternative for the retrovirus equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) to obtain access to the ESCRT-III machinery for budding.

Results
Oligomerization of ESCRT-I Vps28 A number of studies suggest that the ESCRT-I complex forms an approximate 350 kDa large complex composed of multiple copies of Vps37, Vps23 and Vps28 (13,14,16,17). Purified full-length Sacharomyces cerevisiae Vps28 elutes as two peaks from a gel filtration column whose sizes correspond to a monomeric (elution volume 10.2 mL) and a dimeric form (elution volume 9.2 mL) (Figure 1A). Potential dimerization of Vps28 was confirmed by chemical cross-linking of Vps28 from the 9.2-mL peak, which produced a new band on SDS­ PAGE migrating at approximately 60 kDa, compared with the monomeric form migrating at approximately 30 kDa (Figure 1B). Further biochemical characterization by trypsin digestion of full-length dimeric Vps28 produced a stable smaller fragment of 10 kDa that contained residues 114 to 242 according to N-terminal sequencing and mass spectroscopy analyses. Because sequence alignment of Vps28 orthologues indicated a S. cerevisiaespecific insertion from residues 126 to 144 (Figure 2), we cloned and expressed S. cerevisiae Vps28 residues 148 to 242 (Vps28-CTD). Both the tryptic fragment containing residues 114 to 242 and Vps28-CTD form monomers in solution (data not shown), as opposed to full-length Vps28. This indicates that the N-terminal part of Vps28 (residues 1­113) contains the dimerization motif(s). Crystal structure of Vps28-CTD The structure of Vps28-CTD was solved from a selenomethione-containing crystal using the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method and diffraction data to ° 3.2 A. This resulted in a readily interpretable electron density map, which was further improved by sevenfold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging (Figure 3A). The ° final model was refined against a 3.05 A native data set to an Rfactor of 21.6% (Rfree of 27.3%) (Table 1). Vps28-CTD ° folds into a four-helical bundle structure (19 Â 40 Â 21 A) and with N- and C-terminal ends juxtaposed to each other (Figure 3B). Helices 1, 2 and 4 have the same length, while helix 3 is shorter and packs with an approximate angle of 45  against the remaining three helices. The connecting loop regions between helices 1 and 2 and helices 2 and 3 are short compared with the longer well-ordered loop (residue 211­220) connecting helices 3 and 4. The conformation of the loop is largely determined by a conserved leucine residue 218, whose side chain participates in van 1008

der Waals contacts with the extensive hydrophobic core of the four-helical bundle. Because this loop contains a conserved sequence motif (Figures 2 and 4), it may be involved in protein­protein interactions. Otherwise, a much shorter and straight loop such as those connecting the other helices would suffice (Figures 3B and 2). The crystalline asymmetric unit contains seven monomers. These can be grouped into three crystallographic dimers (A-B, C-D, E-F), related by noncrystallographic Traffic 2006; 7: 1007­1016

symmetry while the seventh monomer (G) does not have any partner. The three crystallographic dimers stack on top of each other in a linear manner, while monomer G expands along this assembly perpendicularly to monomer A. In addition, monomers B and C as well as monomers D and E are related by twofold symmetry, giving rise to two potential parallel dimerization modes, one via the distal ends of the bundle structure and the other via the N- and C-terminal ends of the four-helical bundle bringing both N-termini close to each other. In light of the biochemical data showing that full-length Vps28 can form dimers in solution, the dimers of Vp28-CTD observed in the crystal lattice suggest that full-length Vps28 may form parallel dimers. Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that Vps28-CTD is completely flexibly linked to the N-terminal domain, which may form parallel or antiparallel dimers. Traffic 2006; 7: 1007­1016

Sequence conservation of Vps28-CTD Sequence alignment of Vps28 orthologues reveals a high degree of overall conservation between S. cerevisiae and higher eucaryotes, which is equally distributed between the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions (Figure 2). When the sequence conservation is mapped onto the structure of Vps28-CTD, we find that the face of the molecule constituted by helices 1 and 4 is strictly conserved (Figure 4A; right two panels). In contrast, the opposite side, which is made up by the helical pair 2 and 3, shows considerable less conservation (Figure 4A; left two panels). One remarkable feature of the conserved surface is the solvent exposure of the strictly conserved Phe side chain 228 (Figure 4A; right panel). It is of note that the surface charge distribution does not reveal any prominent features, because most of the surface is uncharged (Figure 4B). 1009

Vps28­CTD interactions with ESCRT partners It has been recently shown by pull-down assays that yeast Vps28 interacts with Vps20 (CHMP6) (36). We thus performed similar experiments to map the Vps20 interaction site. We purified recombinant full-length Vp28 fused to GST, Vps28-CTD fused to GST and Vps20 fused to His-thioredoxin (TXR) and performed pull downs with the purified proteins. This shows that GST-Vps28 pulls down HIS-TXR-Vps20 as expected. Vice versa HIS-TXR-Vps20 pulls down GST-VPS28 in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5A). Similarly, GST-Vps28-CTD pulls down HIS-TXR-Vps20 in a concentration-dependent way.

Consistent with the specificity of this interaction, HIS-TXRVps20 also pulls down GST-Vps28-CTD, indicating that Vps28-CTD is sufficient to interact with Vps20 (Figure 5B). To further map the interaction, we mutated helix 4 residues Phe 228 to Ala, Asp 229 to Ser and Glu 231 to Ala located on the conserved surface of Vps28-CTD (Figures 2 and 4A). This showed that the triple mutation abolished the Vps20­Vps28 interaction. Western blots of pull downs using either HIS-TXR-Vps20 or GST-Vps28mut as a bait showed no pull down of either GST-Vps28mut or HISTXR-Vps20, respectively, although the input proteins were clearly present (Figure 5C). This thus implies that

Figure 4: Vps28-CTD contains highly conserved surfaces. (A) The sequence conservation based on the alignment shown in Figure 2 was mapped onto the surface of the Vps28-CTD structure. Strict conservation is shown in green, similar residues are shown in light green and nonidentical residues are shown in white. Four orientations are shown that correspond to the ones presented in Figure 3(B). (B) Electrostatic potential maps of Vps28-CTD reveal that most of Vps28 is uncharged. The orientations are the same as shown in A.

the surface of helix 4 is involved in Vps20 interaction (Figure 5A; right panel). To test whether Vps28-CTD is required for ESCRT-I assembly, we cloned full-length Vps37, Vps23/Tsg101 lacking the N-terminal UEV domain (Vps23-CTD) and either His-tagged full-length Vps28 or His-tagged Vps28-CTD into a polycistronic expression vector. This resulted in expression of all three proteins, Vps37, Vps23-CTD and His-tagged Vps28-CTD (Figure 6A; lane 1) as well as Vps37, Vps23-CTD and His-tagged Vps28 (Figure 6A; lane 2). Subsequent pull down on a Ni2þ affinity column recovered the complete ESCRT-I complex in case of Vps28 coexpression (Figure 6B, lane 2), and only Vps28CTD in case of the Vps28-CTD coexpression (Figure 6B; lane 1). This strongly indicates that the C-terminal domain of Vps28 is not required for ESCRT-I assembly. Human Vps28-CTD rescues an EIAV Gag late domain mutant It has been previously shown that the EIAV Gag late domain can be functionally replaced by fusing full-length hVps28 to the C-terminus of Gag, which targets an EIAV Gag late domain deletion mutant to the VPS pathway Traffic 2006; 7: 1007­1016

required for particle release (35). To further define the role of hVps28 as an alternative pathway for EIAV to enter the Vps system, we generated N- and C-terminal truncations of hVps28 and fused them to an EIAV Gag late domain mutant (Figure 7A). Cellular Gag expression and the release of Gag in form of virus-like particles (VLPs) were then probed by Western blotting. This shows that the late domain mutant L26A-Gag-YFP does not support VLP release and shows only cellular expression, in contrast to the control of WT-Gag-YFP that is efficiently release into the supernatant (Figure 7B; lanes 1­4). Consistent with previous findings, the late domain mutant L26A-Gag-YFP can be rescued by fusing Gag with hVps28 instead of YFP, which allows release of Gag containing VLPs (Figure 7B, lanes 5, 6). We then tested whether the C-terminal domain of hVps28 is sufficient for the late domain mutant rescue and fused hVps28 residues 122­221 (corresponding to S. cerevisiae Vps28 146 to 242) to L26A-Gag, L26A-Gag-hVps28-CTD. This again resulted in a clear release of Gag into the supernatant, indicating that hVps28-CTD can replace the late domain (Figure 7B, lanes 7, 8). In contrast, deletions of C-terminal regions of hVps28 (expressing residues 1­50, 1­100, 1­150 and 1­200) did not support the rescue of the Gag late domain 1011

The presence of GST-Vps28mut was confirmed by using an anti-GST antibody (upper panel). His-Txr-Vps20 does not pull down GSTVps28mut. Equal amounts of His-Txr-Vps20 (50 mg) were incubated with 0, 50 or 5 mg of GST-Vps28mut (lanes 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Western blot analysis was performed with a GST antibody, which detected no GST-Vps28mut (third panel; expected position indicated). The presence of His-Txr-Vps20 was confirmed by using the anti-His antibody (fourth panel).

(B) Purification over a Ni2þ column shows that all three ESCRT-I members Vps37, Vps23-CTD and His-Vps28 are coeluted together from the column (lane 2), while co-purification of full-length Vps37, Vps23-CTD and His-tagged Vps28-CTD on a Ni2þ column shows that only His-tagged Vps28-CTD is recovered (lane 1), indicating that Vps28-CTD is not sufficient to interact with Vps23-CTD and/or Vps37.

however, only a very faint band corresponding to Gag from released VLPs is detected (Figure 7, lanes 9, 10). These data thus indicate that hVps28-CTD is sufficient to rescue the EIAV Gag late domain deletion and suggest that the process requires recruitment of ESCRT-III Vps20 (CHMP6) for efficient EIAV release.

Discussion
The Vps protein Vps28 was shown to be a member of the `class E' vps mutants that accumulate vacuolar, endocytic and late Golgi markers in an aberrant endosome-like class E compartment. Specifically, in cells lacking Vps28, the presence of a novel compartment consisting of stacks of curved membrane cisternae was observed, underlining the essential role of Vps28 in endosomal transport and control of receptor down regulation processes (4,37). It was subsequently shown that Vps28 is, together with Traffic 2006; 7: 1007­1016

mutant (data not shown). To test whether the late domain rescue by hVps28-CTD requires the Vps20 interaction, we introduced Arg202Ala, Phe206Ala, Asp207Ala and Glu209Ala mutations into L26A-Gag-hVps28-CTD, which shows cellular expression of L26A-Gag-hVps28-CTDmut; 1012

into a four-helical bundle structure that is monomeric in solution, in contrast to the dimeric conformation of full-length Vps28. Second, coexpression experiments of Vps23/Tsg101, Vps37 and His-tagged Vps28 in Escherichia coli show that Vps28 can copurify both other members of ESCRT-I, which results in a large multiprotein complex (Pineda-Molina unpublished results). In contrast, coexpression of Vps23/Tsg101, Vps37 and His-tagged Vps28-CTD does not allow copurification of the ESCRT-I components Vps23/Tsg101 or Vps37. Vps28-CTD may thus act as a highly conserved adaptor module for ESCRT-I interaction partners such as ESCRT-II Vps22 and ESCRT-III Vps20 (36). In addition, it may also provide a link to the actin cytoskeleton, as recently suggested (38). The structure presented here reveals that one face of the molecule is strictly conserved, while the opposite site shows less albeit still significant conserved surface patches, indicating that the four-helical bundle may interact with multiple partners. Our mutagenesis work shows that a patch on the conserved surface of helix 4 including residues Phe 228, Asp 229 and Glu231 is involved in binding to Vps20 (CHMP6). Furthermore, enveloped viruses use different late domain sequences present in their Gag or matrix proteins to enter the Vps pathway at distinct steps and exploit it for budding from the host cell (25,26). The EIAV utilizes a YPDL sequence as its late domain, recruiting Alix (28,32,33). Although EIAV release is insensitive to Tsg101 depletion, the late domain can be functionally replaced by fusing human Vps28 to EIAV Gag (35). Our data now extend this work and reveal that Vps28-CTD does not recruit Tsg101 but is sufficient to interact with ESCRT-III partner Vps20/CHMP6, thus possibly providing access to the complete ESCRT-III machinery. Such an interaction would be functionally similar to the normal VPS recruiting pathway of EIAV Gag via Alix, which itself is recruited to cellular membranes by ESCRT-III Snf7/ CHMP4 (28,32,33,39-41). In addition, both CHMP4 and Vps20/CHMP6 have been shown to interact with each other in a subcomplex (21,33,36) indicating that both pathways via Alix or Vps28-CTD would recruit the same ESCRT-III components. Therefore, our data indicate that ESCRT-III recruitment may constitute the minimal cellular machinery to mediate EIAV budding. Interestingly, it was recently shown that the influenza virus matrix protein M1 late domain interacts with Vps28, which is required for efficient virus particle release (42). This is thus also consistent with Vps28 serving as an entry point into the MVB machinery by the EIAV Gag late domain mutant described here. In summary, the crystal structure of Vps28-CTD reveals that ESCRT-I contains, in addition to the autonomously folded Tsg101/Vps23 UEV domain, at least two copies of the Vps28 four-helical bundle that serves as an adaptor for the recruitment of additional Vps components including ESCRT-III Vps20 (CHMP6) (43­45). 1013

Vps23/Tsg101, part of a 350 kDa large complex (12,17) that includes Vps37 (ESCRT-I). ESCRT-I recognizes ubiquitinylated cargo during membrane receptor sorting into MVB vesicles and thus regulates MVB biogenesis (13). Here, we show that Vps28 dimerizes in solution, which is consistent with the observation that ESCRT-I is composed of multiple copies of Vps28, Vps23/Tsg101 and Vps37 (13­16). We further show that Vps28 is composed of at least two domains, an N-terminal region responsible for oligomerization and a C-terminal domain that folds autonomously into a four-helical bundle structure. Although the crystal packing suggests that Vps28 may form parallel dimers, the four-helical bundle may be completely flexibly linked to the N-terminal oligomerization domain, either in a parallel or in an antiparallel fashion. Vps28 was first shown to form a subcomplex with Tsg101, which requires the C-terminal region of Tsg101 (17) and specifically the last 60 residues containing the S-Box sequences (14). On the basis of our data, we propose that the N-terminal half of Vps28 is required for interactions with Vps23/Tsg101 and Vps37 for two main reasons (14,17,36). First, Vps28-CTD folds independently Traffic 2006; 7: 1007­1016

Materials and Methods
Expression constructs
cDNAs encoding for full-length S. cerevisiae Vps28 (residues 1­242) and Vps28 residues 142 to 242 (Vps28-CTD) were cloned into the vector pPROEX-Hta (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using standard PCR protocols. Vps28, Vps28-CTD and the mutant of Vps28 (Vps28mut) were also cloned into the vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA) adding an N-terminal GST fusion protein (GST-Vps28; GST-Vps28-CTD; GSTVps28mut). A mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to introduce the mutations (Phe 228 to Ala, Asp 229 to Ser and Glu 231 to Ala) into the Vps28 gene. Full-length yeast Vps20 was cloned in expression vector pET-32 (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) adding an N-terminal Histagged thioredoxin fusion protein (His-Txr-Vps20). The sequences of all clones were verified by DNA sequencing. For coexpression experiments, Vps23-CTD (residues 220­382), full-length Vps37 and full-length Vps28 or Vps28-CTD (142­242) were cloned into the poly cistronic vector pST39 as described (46). A hexa-His-tag and a TEV protease cleavage site were introduced at the N-terminus of both Vps28 variants to allow copurification of the complex. The sequences of the clones were verified by DNA sequencing.

GST-Vps28-CTD or GST-Vps28mut. The pull down of Vps28 was detected by Western blotting using a GST-specific antibody (Amersham). Because the mutant GST-Vps28mut did not pull down His-Txr-Vps20 and vice versa, we detect only either GST-Vps28mut or His-Txr-Vps20 on Western blots using both the anti-His and the anti-GST antibodies on the same blot.

EIAV Gag budding assay
The preparation of the late domain mutant L26AYFP, WT EIAVYFP and the hVps28 fusion construct was described previously (35). The hVps28 truncations and the hVps28 mutations (human Vps28 residues R202 to A, F206 to A, D207 to A, E209 to A; corresponding to yeast residues R224, F228, D229 and E231 based on the sequence alignment shown in Figure 2) were generated by standard techniques and then subcloned proximal to EIAV Gag. Human 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. To examine Gag particle release, 293T cells were transfected via calcium phosphate with the indicated Gag expression plasmid. Forty-eight hours post transfection, supernatant was collected, clarified by filtration through a 0.45-mm pore-size filter and pelleted through 20% sucrose at 285,000g in a SW41 (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) for 60 min. Cell lysates and viral pellets were resuspended in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton-X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA). Samples were prepared for SDS ­ PAGE and analysed by Western blot with an anti-EIAV Gag rabbit polyclonal antibody kindly provided by Ronald Montalero. Blots were developed by the Super Signal West Pico kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and visualized by an LAS-1000plus luminescent image analyser (Fuji, Tokio, Japan).

Protein expression and purification
Protein expression was generally performed in E. coli BL-21 codonþ cells at 37  C. All His-tagged Vps28 proteins were purified on a Ni2þ-sepharose column in a buffer 1 (25 mM Tris pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol), and the His-tag was removed by TEV protease cleavage over night at 4  C at a 1:500 (w/w) ratio. Further purification was carried out on a mono Q column (Amersham) in buffer 2 (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM bmercaptoethanol) by applying a salt gradient. A final gel filtration chromatography step on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham) was then performed in buffer 1. Trypsin digestion of full-length Vps28 was performed at three different ratios 1:200, 1:500 and 1:1000 (w/w) in buffer 1. Seleno-methionine-derivatized Vps28-CTD was produced as described (47) and purified as detailed above. ESCRT-I complex variants cloned into pST39 were expressed in E. coli C41 (DE3) cells during 14 h at 16  C after induction with 1 mM IPTG. Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer 1 containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the ESCRT-I complex was purified on a Ni2þ-sepharose column (Amersham).

Crystallization of Vps28-CTD and data collection
Initial crystallization conditions for Vps28-CTD were determined by using a Cartesian crystallization robot by screening 600 conditions. Hexagonalshaped crystals were obtained by mixing 1 mL of protein solution (6 mg/ mL) and 1 mL of reservoir solution containing 1 M ammonium sulphate and 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6). Crystals were cryo-protected in mother liquor supplemented with 30% glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Vps28-CTD crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6122, with unit ° ° cell parameters of a ¼ b ¼ 118.37 A and c ¼ 295.87 A. A single crystal ° was used to collect a highly redundant 3.2 A Single Anomalous Diffraction (SAD) data set at the selenium K absorption peak at the UK CRG beamline ° BM14 at the ESRF (Grenoble). In addition, a 3.05 A resolution native data set has been collected at the ESRF beam line ID14-EH1, which was used for refinement. BM14 diffraction data were recorded on a MAR225 CCD detector and processed with the HKL2000 program package (48), while ID14-EH1 data were collected on an ADSC Q4 CCD detector and processed with the software MOSFLM (49) and SCALA of the CCP4 suite (50). The crystallographic data statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Chemical cross-linking
Samples in buffer 3 (50 mM Hepes pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl) were incubated with glutaraldehyde at the indicated concentrations at room temperature for 20 min. The reactions were quenched with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.8), and samples were separated on SDS ­ PAGE.

Phasing and refinement
The selenium atom substructure and initial phases were obtained from the selenium peak SAD data set via the use of the HKL2MAP interface (51). The program SHELXD (52) revealed seven selenium sites, and a first protein electron density map was determined with the program SHELXE (53) assuming a solvent content of 62%. Inspection of the electron density map revealed very clearly Vps28-CTD as a bundle of 4 helices with a single selenomethionine residue ordered in each monomer and a total of seven monomers in the asymmetric unit. An initial asymmetric unit model was built with the ArpWarp low-resolution helix builder program (54). A total of 28 poly alanine helix fragments were determined and manually grouped into seven monomers, each containing 4 helices. Equivalent helical residues in the seven monomers were assigned and then used to determine the NCS symmetry operations with LSQKAB (50). Sevenfold NCS averaging was then used together with solvent flattening to improve the electron density map using DM (50). Model building was performed manually with the program COOT (55), ° and the model was refined against the 3.05 A resolution data using CNS (56) and REFMAC5 (57). During the refinement procedures, tight NCS restraints were applied to equivalent helices, while the loops were treated

Pull-down assays
GST-Vps28, GST-Vps28-CTD and GST-Vps28mut were expressed in E. coli BL21 codonþ cells, lysed in buffer 1 by sonication and purified on a Glutathione Sepharose 4B column (Amersham). Proteins were eluted in buffer 1 plus 10 mM glutathione. His-Txr-Vps20 was expressed 5 h at 30 degrees in E. coli BL21 codonþ cells and purified on a Ni2þ-sepharose column (Amersham). His-Txr-Vps20 was eluted from the column by applying an imidazole gradient in buffer 1. Purified His-Txr-Vps20 and all GSTVps28 variants were then dialysed extensively against buffer 1 to remove glutathione and imidazole, respectively. For pull downs, 50 mg of GST-Vps28, GST-Vps28-CTD and GST-Vps28mut were bound to 50 mL resin and incubated with either no His-Txr-Vps20 or 50 mg and 5 mg of purified protein. The beads were washed five times with buffer 1, and the bound material was released by boiling in SDS loading buffer and separated on SDS­PAGE. The pull down of His-Txr-Vps20 was detected by Western blotting using a His-tag-specific antibody (Amersham). The same pull down was performed by binding 50 mg of purified His-Txr-Vps20­50 mL of beads and adding 5 mg of GST-Vps28,

The final model consists of seven monomers, each containing residues 148­241 and was refined to an Rfactor of 21.6% and Rfree of 27.3% with good stereochemistry (see Table 1 for refinement statistics). About 89.2% of the residues are in the most favoured, 9.6% in additional and 1.1% in generously allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot according to the analysis with PROCHECK (50).
