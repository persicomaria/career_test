Four site-directed mutants of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c2, which substitute lysines at three positions with aspartate or glutamate, have been prepared. Mutations included the single charge substitutions K12D, K14E, and K32E and a double charge substitution K14E/ K32E. Characterization of the ionic strength dependence of the wild-type and mutant redox potentials in the "nonbinding" buffer Tris-cacodylate suggests that (i) at zero ionic strength introduction of negatively charged groups stabilizes the oxidized state by 11-14 mV per charge and (ii) at high ionic strengths where the charged groups are masked, the effects of single charge substitutions are overcome; however, the redox potential of the double charge substitution is still affected. These results indicate that at physiological ionic strengths charge distribution only affects redox potential when the heme environment has been perturbed by a structural perturbation and that the determinants of redox potential in ctype cytochromes is primarily due to the local heme environment. 0 1991 Academic Press, Inc.

decreases in redox potential are due to increases in the stability of the oxidized state as a result of interaction between the positively charged iron group and a more negative (less positive) protein electrostatic field. These observations led us to examine the effects of specific charge substitutions on the redox potential of a c-type cytochrome. In the present study, the redox potential properties of four site-directed mutants of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome ca have been characterized as a function of ionic strength. Mutants K12D2 (lysine 12 to aspartate), K14E (lysine 14 to glutamate), and K32E (lysine 32 to glutamate) result in a change of the charge of a surface group from $1 to -1. Mutant K14E/K32E (lysines 14 and 32 to glutamates) results in changes in the signs of the charges of two surface groups and a net change of +2 to -2. The effects of these mutations on the redox potential in a "nonbinding" buffer, Tris-cacodylate, will be discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Electron transfer proteins display a wide variety of redox potentials which are determined by the nature of the prosthetic group and the protein environment of the prosthetic group (1). One structural parameter of the prosthetic group environment which influences the redox potential is the distribution of charges on the protein surface. For example, in simple iron complexes introduction of negatively charged groups results in redox potential decreases of several hundred millivolts (2). Furthermore, random modification of horse cytochrome c lysine groups to negatively charged groups has been demonstrated to lower its redox potential but to a lesser degree (3). These

Mutagenesis procedures and protein isolations have been described elsewhere (Caffrey et al., submitted, 4). The purified charge mutants exhibited no spectral differences from the wild-type cytochrome cg in the visible and ultraviolet regions. All charge mutant ferricytochromes cz displayed a near infrared absorbance (696 nm) which could not be distinguished from the wild-type cytochrome c2, indicating that the ironmethionine bond was present and unperturbed (5). As determined by titration of the 696 band, the wild-type and mutants displayed alkaline transition pK values greater than 8.3 (to be reported elsewhere). Thus the alkaline transition pK has no effect on redox potentials at pH 7.0. Redox potentials were determined by monitoring the ferricytochrome/ ferrocytochrome ratio spectrophotometrically at 550 nm during titration with potassium ferrocyanide. Buffer conditions were 10 to 300 mM Triscacodylate, pH 7.0, at 23°C. The Nernst plots were linear with slope

From replicate analyses, uncertainties were estimated to be less than +4 mV. Previously, Pettigrew et al. (7) demonstrated that the redox titration of R. capsulatus cytochrome cx was reversible and that the ferrocyanide titration method gave results which were identical to that of the combination electrode method.

DISCUSSION

All of the experiments described in this study were performed in the nonbinding buffer Tris-cacodylate at pH 7.0 to eliminate primary salt effects. Note that R. cupsulatus cytochrome c2 does not exhibit a pH dependence of redox potential in the region 4.0 to 8.5 (7). In Fig. 1 the results of the redox potential experiments for the wildtype and four charge mutant cytochromes have been plotted as a function of buffer concentration. First note that the cytochrome redox potential behaviors fall into three groups: the wild type, single charge substitutions, and the double charge substitution. The wild-type potential decreases with increasing buffer concentration (i.e., ionic strength) to a limiting value of 372 mV. The isoelectric point of R. capsulatus cytochrome c2 is 7.3 (Caffrey, unpublished results) and therefore the wild-type cytochrome is expected to possess a net positive charge at pH 7.0. Consequently, the redox potential of the wild-type cytochrome is expected to decrease with increasing ionic strength due to counterion shielding of the net positive surface charge which destabilizes the oxidized state. The three single charge substitutions exhibit a similar ionic strength dependence of redox potential; however, at low ionic strengths their potentials are significantly decreased with respect to the wild-type cytochrome. At high ionic strengths the potentials of K12D, K14E, and K32E appear to converge toward the wild-type value of 372 mV (Fig. 1). These observations indicate that at low ionic strengths the oxidized states of these mutants have been stabilized with respect to the wild-type cytochrome, which is consistent with substitution of a negatively charged group for a positively charged group. On the other hand, at high ionic strength this stabilization is masked by the high concentration of counterions and thus the redox potentials of the single charge substitutions are similar to wild type. In the case of the double charge substitution K14E/ K32E, the redox potential again decreaseswith increasing ionic strength. At low ionic strengths the potential is lower than the single charge substitutions, which is consistent with additive effects on the stabilization of the oxidized state resulting from substituting two lysines with glutamates. However, at ionic strengths greater than 0.15 Ml/' the redox potential of K14E/K32E is still lower by 29 mV than the wild type and single charge substitutions. Therefore, factors other than the charge distribution of K14E/K32E apparently are affecting the redox potential at high ionic strengths. One explanation is that the double charge mutation has induced structural perturbations

which have perturbed the local heme environment. For example, an increase in the solvent exposure of the heme group in K14E/K32E would result in stabilization of the oxidized state. The dependence of redox potential on ionic strength at low ionic strengths can be described by the equation: E& = E" - (2.3RT/F)A(q:, - q:dF(I),

PI

where Ezbbs the standard redox potential observed at a is given ionic strength; E" is the standard redox potential extrapolated to zero ionic strength; R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature; A is the Debye-Huckel constant for water at 25°C (0.504); F is the Faraday constant; qoxand &.d are the net protein charges in the oxidized and reduced states; and F(I) is the appropriate function of ionic strength (8). Upon substitution of the appropriate constants and experimental values, Eq. [ 1] simplifies to E& = E" - o.o3(q:, - qfed)F(I). Previously, the redox potential dependency on ionic strength of various c-type cytochromes was best fit to Eq. [2] when the function F(I) was defined as either 1l/`/(l + 11") for Euglena cytochrome c (9) or 1'/`/(1+ 61"`) for horse cytochrome c (8). In the present study the data for R. capsulatus cytochrome c2were best fit by the first function and therefore that function will be employed here. In Fig. 2, the wild-type and charge mutant potentials have been plotted as functions of F(I), i.e., 1'j2/(1 + Zl"). The parameters E" and qox (assuming qred= qox - 1) can be estimated from linear regressions of the data in Fig. 2

(Table I), From analysis of the E" values, the redox potential of R. capsulatus cytochrome c2 at zero ionic strength is decreased 22 to 28 mV upon substitution of one lysine with an acidic group. The net effect on protein charge for the single charge substitutions is a decrease in charge of two and thus the potential is decreased by 11 to 14 mV per charge. In K14E/K32E, the extrapolated E" is 53 mV lower than the wild-type cytochrome and the charge effect at zero ionic strength can be estimated to be 13 mV per charge, which is in very good agreement with the single charge substitution data. The qoxestimates for the wild-type protein are consistent for the expected charge of +3 from the R. capsulatus cytochrome c2 amino acid sequence (10) if the heme propionates are considered to be protonated. Analysis of the R. capsulatus cytochrome c2structure indicates that both propionates are buried in the protein interior and thus can be expected to be protonated (Holden et al., in preparation). On the other hand, the single charge substitutions exhibit qoxvalues that are lessthan the wild-type value but not by the expected value of two. Moreover, the double charge substitution qoxvalue is further decreased but not to the expected level (i.e., changing the net cytochrome charge by four would be expected to change the net ferricytochrome c charge to -1 not +2). Note that use of other functions for F(Z) (e.g., Z1" or Z'12/(1 + 6Z'/")) did not improve this calculation. One potential explanation for the inconsistencies in the calculated net charge of the charge substitutions is binding of the Tris cation at the site of the newly introduced negative charges. Determination of the binding constants of the Tris cation for the wild type and charge mutants is necessary to properly estimate the net cytochrome charge from this data. Nonetheless, the E" and qoxvalues are in qualitative agreement with the effect of charge substitutions on the redox potential of a c-type cytochrome.

At this point it is useful to compare the R. capsulatus data with c-type cytochromes from other species. First note that the decreasing E" and slope values with decreasing net charge is in agreement with a previous study on maleylated derivatives of horse cytochrome c (3). Interestingly, the extrapolated E" values for a series of ctype cytochromes in which charge effects are maximal do not appear to be correlated with the net protein charge. For example horse, R. capsulatus, and Euglena cytochromes c possessnet charges of +8, +3, and -8, respectively, and exhibit E" values of 270, 416, and 270 mV (8, this study, 9). Further note that at high ionic strengths when the charge effects are minimal, the Euglena value extrapolates to the R. capsulatus value of ca. 370 mV and the horse potential drops to 260 mV. These observations suggest that factors other than ligand nature or surface charge distribution are the controlling factors of redox potential at low and physiological ionic strengths. Indeed, substitution of a highly conserved group in the R. capsulatus cytochrome c2 heme environment, tyrosine 75 to phenylalanine, results in a redox potential decrease of 59 mV (Caffrey et al., unpublished observations). Moreover, in yeast iso-l cytochrome c substitution of phenylalanine 82 by serine results in a ca. 50 mV decrease of the redox potential due in part to an increase in the heme solvent exposure (11,12). It has been demonstrated here that surface charges play a small but measurable role in redox potentials at low ionic strengths which is generally overcome at physiological ionic strengths of greater than 0.15 M'12. Presently, the high resolution structures of the R. capsulatus wildtype and charge mutants are being determined by X-ray crystallography (13) and NMR techniques (4). It is anticipated that the availability of these structures as well as generation of future site-directed mutations will allow for a better understanding of the determinants of redox potentials in cytochromes.
