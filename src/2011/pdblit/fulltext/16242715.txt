Abstract Some triazole derivatives (4-amino-5-mercapto-3-methyl 1,2,4-triazole (AMMT), 4-amino-5-mercapto-3-ethyl 1,2,4-triazole (AMET) and 4amino-5-mercapto-3-propyl 1,2,4-triazole (AMPT)) have been evaluated as new corrosion inhibitors for the corrosion of muntz alloy (60Cu­40Zn) in acidic and neutral solutions. The adsorption of these compounds has been tested thermodynamically which was found to be of a physisorption mode. Furthermore, some activation thermodynamic parameters such as DH*, DS* and DG* of activation have been estimated. In addition, a trial to find a quantitative relationship between the inhibition efficiency and the electronic properties of the inhibitor molecules was carried out. # 2006 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction Addition of inhibitors remains one of the necessary procedures used to protect metals and alloys against attack in many industrial environments. Therefore, the development of corrosion inhibitors based on organic compounds containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen atoms are of growing interest in the field of corrosion and industrial chemistries as corrosion poses a serious problem to the service life time of alloys used in industry [1]. However, the efficiency of these inhibitors depends on the nature and the state of the metallic surfaces, chemical composition, and structure of the inhibitor. Furthermore, the stability of the adsorbed inhibitor films formed over the metal surface to protect the metal from corrosion depends on some physico-chemical properties of the molecule, related to its functional groups, aromaticity, the possible steric effects, electronic density of donors, type of corrosive medium and nature of the interaction between the inhibitor and the metal surface [2­4]. This interaction is generally explained by the

formation of an adsorptive film of a physical and/or chemical character on the metal surface. Adsorption of inhibitors may block either cathodic, anodic, or both reactions. The electrostatic attraction between the charged inhibitor molecules and the charge-active centers on the metal surface leads to physisorption. Data in the literature show that most organic inhibitors adsorb on metals by displacing water molecules on the surface and forming a compact barrier film [4­6]. One of the most effective ways to judge whether the nature of interaction is Physisorption or chemisorption is to calculate the thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption process. Recently, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) has been a subject of intense interest in many disciplines of chemistry. The development of semi-empirical quantum chemical calculations emphasizes the scientific approaches involved in the selection of inhibitors by correlating the experimental data with quantum-chemical properties. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), charges on reactive centre, dipole moment (m) and conformations of molecules have been used to achieve the appropriate correlations. The aim of this work was to estimate the thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption of some triazole derivatives from the data presented by Iyer and co-workers [7] for the corrosion of Muntz alloy in acidic and neutral solutions to see

whether the adsorption of these new derivatives proceeds via physisorption or chemisorption mode which has great impact on their use in different industrial environments under different practical conditions. On the other hand, some kinetic parameters, such as enthalpy and entropy of corrosion process, have been estimated from the data concerned the study of the effect of temperature on the corrosion process. Also, a trial to find a quantitative relationship between the inhibition efficiency and the electronic structure of the inhibitor molecules was carried out. 2. Experimental 2.1. Electrochemical measurements The experimental details are shown in the Iyer and coworkers [7] paper. 2.2. Calculation method  SPARTAN'02 semi-empirical program.  Model: RHF/3-21G. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Thermodynamics considerations 3.1.1. Adsorption isotherm Basic information on the interaction between the inhibitor and the alloy surface can be provided by the adsorption isotherm. In order to obtain the isotherm, the fractional coverage values u as a function of inhibitor concentration must be obtained. It is well known that u can be obtained from the corrosion current via [8­10]:  u ¼1À icorr;inh icorr;b  (1)

isotherm u is related to the equilibrium adsorption constant (K) and concentration of inhibitor in molarity (C) via [11]: u ¼ KC n (2)

where 0 < n < 1. In logarithmic form Eq. (2) can be written as: log u ¼ log K þ n log C (3)

Eq. (3) predicts that a plot of log u versus log C will be linear. On the other hand, the equilibrium constant of adsorption is related to the standard energy of adsorption, DG ads by [8]:     1 DG ads exp À K¼ (4) 55:5 RT where the value 55.5 is the concentration of water in the solution in mol dmÀ3. Tables 2­4 show the data for the three tested corrosion inhibitors AMMT, AMET and AMPT in the form of the surface coverage (u) obtained at different inhibitor concentrations (C). Note that, the inhibitor concentrations are expressed in molarity units. On the other hand, Figs. 1­3 show the change of log u as a function of log C in both media. The data are fitted to the Freundlich adsorption isotherm and by using regression methods we were able to get the K and DG ads . On the other hand, Table 5 summaries the obtained equilibrium adsorption constant (K) and standard energy of adsorption (DG ads ) values for the investigated inhibitors. Also, from the slope we found that the value of n is 0 < n < 1 which confirms applicability of the Freundlich isotherm. The standard free energies of adsorption calculated from the isotherm in both acidic and neutral media vary from À14.64 to À14.88 kJ/mol. It has been suggested that chemisorption requires a standard free energy of adsorption on the order of 100 kJ/mol [9]. This is in general agreement with the measurement of the bond energies for thiols chemisorbed to  gold [12,13]. On the other hand, Metikos-Hukovic et al. [14] described the interaction between thiourea and iron (DG ads ¼ À39 kJ=mol) as chemisorption. The DG ads values obtained here are substantially below either of these limits. Such low values of DG ads show that in the presence of 1 M HCl, chemisorption of these inhibitors does not occur. This makes chemical sense, because at this very low pH value, these molecules are protonated. This removes one of the lone pairs and lowers the basicity of the remaining lone pairs [15]. Thus, we eliminate chemisorption via lone pair electrons as a possible mechanism for corrosion inhibition by these inhibitors in hydrochloric acid. Other possible mechanisms for chemisorption

where u is the surface coverage, icorr,inh the corrosion current density in the presence of the inhibitor and icorr,b is the corrosion current density in the absence of the inhibitor (blank solution). The u values obtained in this way are shown in Table 1. Attempts were made to fit these u values to various isotherms including Frumkin, Langmuir, Temkin, and Freundlich. Many adsorption isotherms were plotted and the Freundlich adsorption isotherm was found to be the best description of the adsorption behavior of the studied inhibitors. According to this

are via donation of p-electron density in the aromatic rings, especially the triazole ring, and electrostatic adsorption of the cationic inhibitor to adsorbed chlorides on the electrode surface. XRD presented by Iyer and co-workers [7] showed that chemisorbed films are not present when the inhibitor is dissolved in 1N HCl. This eliminates chemisorption via any mechanism as a possibility for corrosion inhibition by these inhibitors. Thus, it seems unlikely that a polymeric film can occur in such highly acidic solutions [15]. This is because the inhibitors are fully protonated in 1 M HCl and film formation requires deprotonation of the triazole ring. On the other hand, similar results were reported by Allam et al. [16] for Cu10Ni alloy in 3.4% NaCl in the presence of benzotriazole where the DG ads value obtained was À20.8 kJ/mol. Furthermore, the protonation of 3-amino1,2,4-triazole was studied potentiometrically (glass electrode) in sodium chloride and calcium chloride solutions, 0.13 I ! 0.92M, at 10, 25, 37 and 458 [17]. The effect of the background electrolyte on the protonation constants is explained by a complex formation model. The species CaL+, CaHL2+ and

H2LCl (HL = 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) are proposed. Stability constants, together with their dependence on temperature (DH8) and on ionic strength, are reported for the protonated and complex species. This leaves physisorption as a possible mechanism for corrosion inhibition by these molecules. The low values of DG ads obtained here (Table 5) support this physisorption-based mechanism. This is also supported by the fact that the higher molecular weight triazole derivatives show better corrosion inhibition. Cook and Hackerman [18] showed the same trend for a variety of different inhibitors on steel. Hackerman also showed that physisorption was higher for the higher molecular weight members of this inhibitor series. Furthermore, Ye et al. [19] studied tetrazole compounds on copper and also showed that the highest molecular weight version was the best inhibitor. They proposed that hydrophobic interactions are responsible for better film formation for the highest molecular weight inhibitor. Zucchi et al. [20] investigated tetrazole derivatives on copper in chloride medium at different pH values and they likewise deduced that the greater

hydrophobicity of the substituted molecule increased inhibition efficiency. These data and the prior studies support a physisorption based mechanism for corrosion inhibition by these triazole-based inhibitors in the investigated solutions. Also, it is noteworthy feature that the calculated values of DG ads in the neutral medium (3.5% NaCl) are greater than those in acidic medium (1N HCl) which means that the electrostatic interaction between the inhibitor and the Muntz surface is stronger in the neutral medium than that in the acidic medium. 3.1.2. Determination of the linear polarization resistance from polarization curves A commonly used method to monitor corrosion in industry is the ``polarization resistance'' method. If a small current is passed between two identical probes corroding in an installation, the potential of one is raised, that of the other is lowered. If the potential shift is less than about 30 mV, the magnitude of the shift DE at each of the electrodes (half the total potential difference) is proportional to the impressed current Di. The ratio DE/Di is known as the polarization resistance of the probe, Rp, and can be related to the corrosion current by the Stern­Geary equation: I corr ¼ B Rp (5)

The calculated Rp values for the free and inhibited solutions at 30 8C using the optimum concentration of the tested inhibitors (600 ppm) are shown in (Table 6). It is clear that the polarization resistance in the neutral medium is greater than that in the acidic medium. This means that the alloy corrodes faster in the acid medium. Furthermore, the polarization resistance increases with the addition of inhibitors. It is noteworthy feature that the Rp increases as the molecular weight of the inhibitor increases. Also, for one and the same inhibitor the Rp values in the neutral medium is greater than that in the acidic medium this means that the stability of the adsorbed inhibitor film on the alloy surface is higher in the neutral medium than that in the acidic medium. This is in agreement with the DG ads values calculated in both media (see Table 5). 3.1.3. Effect of temperature on the corrosion current The corrosion reaction can be regarded as an Arrhenius-type process, the rate of which is given by:   ÀEa icorr ¼ A exp (7) RT where icorr is the corrosion current density, A the Arrhenius preexponential constant, and Ea is the activation energy for the corrosion process which represents the energy necessary for a molecule to possess in order to react. Tables 7­8 show the Variation of the icorr values with temperature in both 1N HCl and 3.5% NaCl media in the absence and presence of the tested inhibitors, respectively. On the other hand, Figs. 4­5 present the Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the corrosion current density versus 1/T for both media in the presence of inhibitors at their optimum concentrations (600 ppm). The Ea values determined from the slopes of these plots are shown in Table 9. Note first that the

The proportionality constant, B, for a particular system can be calculated from ba and bc, the slopes of the anodic and cathodic

steel in 1 M H2SO4 in the presence of 10À3 M imidazole [22]. In addition, the Ea values increase in the same order as the inhibition efficiency; i.e., the best inhibitor shows the highest value of activation energy for the corrosion process. 3.1.4. Temperature effect and thermodynamic activation parameters The enthalpy of activation (DH*) can be obtained from the following relation [23]: DH Ã ¼ Ea À RT (8)

Ea values obtained in both media are very low, indicating fast corrosion of the alloy electrode. These values may be compared with a value of 70 kJ/mol for corrosion of mild steel in 2 N HCl (uninhibited) [21] and a value of 76 kJ/mol for corrosion of

where K is the rate constant, k the Boltzmann's constant, h the Planck's constant and T is the absolute temperature. Moreover, the entropy of activation (DS*) is obtained using the equation: DGÃ ¼ DH Ã À T DSÃ (10)

The thermodynamic activation parameters calculated using the above relations are listed in Tables 10­11. A comparison of the activation parameters (Tables 8 and 10) corresponding to the free and the inhibited systems indicate that, the corrosion process is enthalpy-controlled. It is clear that, the higher rate is associated with lower activation energy (Ea = 4.17 and 7.66 kJ/mol for HCl and NaCl free systems, respectively) and lower rates are associated with higher activation energy (for the inhibited system) [25], see Table 9. The negative values of entropy of activation are in line with an associatively activated process [25] and the probability of formation and stability of the activated state increases in the order AMPT > AMET > AMMT. 3.2. Quantum chemistry calculations The quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) of the triazole derivatives as inhibitors for corrosion of Muntz alloy in acidic medium have been done with SPARTAN'02 semiempirical program. The experimental values of the corrosion inhibition efficiency were obtained from literature [7]. Table 12 shows the calculated quantum chemical properties for

compounds, EHOMO (eV), ELUMO (eV), dipole moment, m (Debye), total entropy, total enthalpy and free energy. EHOMO is often associated with the electron donating ability of a molecule, whereas ELUMO indicates its ability to accept electrons. Figs. 6­9 show the estimated parameters as functions of the inhibition efficiency obtained from the experimental data. As EHOMO is often associated with the electron donating ability of the molecule, high values of EHOMO are likely to indicate a tendency of the molecule to donate electrons to appropriate acceptor molecules with low energy and empty molecular orbital. From Table 12, it is clear that EHOMO increases as the inhibition efficiency increases. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between EHOMO and the inhibition efficiency. It is noticed that the relation is an exponential growth one. The negative sign of the EHOMO indicates that the adsorption is physisorption [26] which is in agreement with the results of DG ads . Estimated from the thermodynamics calculations, see Table 5. By using regression analysis, the relationship between the EHOMO and the inhibition efficiency can be represented by the following equation:   EHOMO À64 eff:% ¼ 88:36667 þ 1:82 Â 10 exp 6:64 Â 10À4 On the other hand, Fig. 7 depicts the relationship between the energy gap and the inhibition efficiency. It is clear that the inhibition efficiency increases linearly with the energy gap. Again, by using regression analysis the relationship can be written as: eff:% ¼ À31:1831 þ 8:692½ELUMO À EHOMO  Also, the relationship between the charge on the nitrogen atom of the NH2 group and the inhibition efficiency is tested (see Fig. 8). It is clear that the charge increases as the chain of the alkyl group attached to the triazole ring increases which in turn lead to higher inhibition efficiency. This is in agreement with the electron donating character of the alkyl group. From basic organic chemistry we know that as the alkyl chain length increases, its

In contrast, we cannot find any clear relationship between the estimated values of ELUNO, the dipole moment and the inhibition efficiency. This can be related to the complexity of the system. 4. Conclusions 1. From Tafel slopes, the polarization resistance (Rp) was estimated. The estimated values for Rp shows the same trend as the inhibition efficiency i.e., as the Rp increases the inhibition efficiency increases. 2. The activation energy (Ea) values determined from the temperature dependence of icorr increased in the same order as the inhibition efficiencies. 3. The values obtained for the standard free energies of adsorption and the negative values of EHOMO indicate physical adsorption of these inhibitors to Muntz surface. 4. All the inhibitors investigated followed the Freundlich isotherm. 5. A comparison of the activation parameters corresponding to the free and the inhibited systems indicate that, the corrosion process is enthalpy-controlled. 6. The negative values of entropy of activation are in line with an associatively activated process and the probability of formation and stability of the activated state increases in the order AMPT > AMET > AMMT. 7. There is a strong quantitative relationship between EHOMO, energy gap, free energy, the charge on nitrogen atom and the inhibition efficiency for the tested compounds. Knowing these relationships, many corrosion inhibitors with good inhibition efficiency can be synthesized. 8. Although a number of satisfactory correlations between the inhibition efficiency of various inhibitors and selected quantum chemical parameters have been existed, there is still a lack of a simple correlation between some of these

parameters (the dipole, the ELUMO) and the inhibition efficiencies. References
