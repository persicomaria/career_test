Herein we describe the rapid elaboration of highly potent and ligand efficient analogues using a fragment growing approach. Iterative structure-based design was supported by protein-ligand structure determinations using a PKA-PKB "chimera" and a final protein-ligand structure of a lead compound in PKB itself.

Protein kinase B (PKBa or Akt) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a central role in the regulation of a variety of signal transduction pathways integral to the control of cell growth, differentiation, and division.1,2 Disregulation and overexpression of PKB has been demonstrated in a growing number of human malignancies, thus providing a potential mechanism for the survival and progression of tumor cells.2-6 As such, inhibition of PKB, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutics, is considered to be a potentially valuable approach to the treatment of cancers. The most exemplified strategy for inhibiting PKB targets the kinase domain by competitive inhibition of the ATP binding site. A number of small molecule inhibitors that exploit this approach have been reported.7-9 The recent availability of the three-dimensional crystal structure of active, phosphorylated PKB 10 (Akt-2) has enhanced opportunities for the development of novel ATP-competitive inhibitors. However, its application to iterative structure-based design has so far been limited by the lack of a robust, soakable crystal form. Structure-based approaches have therefore predominantly resorted to employing surrogate systems, such as the closely related kinase PKA,9,11,12 or mutant forms of PKA, in which ATP-site residues are mutated to form a PKA-PKB "chimera".7 We have, however, recently reported a novel method for obtaining crystal structures of PKB itself in complex with

ligands,13 and for the purposes of the research reported in this manuscript, both PKA-PKB and PKB crystal structures were used. Herein we describe the application of X-ray crystallography for the rapid development of a potent series of ATP competitive inhibitors of PKB. Fragment screening14,15 was carried out using our "Pyramid" approach, which has been described previously and applied to a number of therapeutic targets, including kinases.16,17 This approach identified fragment 1 as an X-ray hit when it was soaked into crystals of PKA-PKB (see Figure 1). The fragment binds to the hinge region of the kinase via hydrogen bonds with the backbone N-H of Ala123 and backbone carbonyl of Glu121 (Figure 2a). Though only moderately potent, fragment 1 demonstrates a high degree of ligand efficiency and, as such, was considered to represent a useful start point for further optimization using a fragment growing strategy. Ligand efficiency (LE) has been defined by Hopkins et al.18 as LE ) -G/HAC, where G is the free

energy of binding of a compound, which can be estimated from its IC50, and HAC is the number of nonhydrogen atoms in the compound (see also Kuntz et al.19). Monitoring and maintaining ligand efficiency during design cycles is considered important to ensure that the final compound exhibits desirable physicochemical properties. To obtain a final compound with MW < 500 Da and 10 nM potency, ligand efficiency needs to stay above 0.30 kcal/mol per heavy atom. Inspection of the 3D structure of fragment 1 suggested that a basic group could be added to probe the ribose binding pocket, an electronegative region of the protein formed by residues Glu127, Glu170, Asn171, and Asp184. Accordingly, we synthesized compounds 2-4 (Figure 1). Bioassay data demonstrated that attaching a basic amine can result in up to 30-fold improvement in the potency of these compounds while retaining the ligand efficiency of the initial fragment. The X-ray structure of compound 3 (Figure 2b) confirmed the expected interactions between the basic amine and residues in the electronegative pocket. In addition, we tested compound 5, the des-methyl analog of fragment 1, and found that the methyl group only provided a marginal improvement to the potency. In the next design cycle, aromatic rings were incorporated into the compounds to access a lipophilic pocket adjacent to the glycine rich loop. Two of these compounds, 6 and 7, are shown in Figure 1. The addition of the phenyl ring results in a 10-fold improvement in potency and sub-µM affinity for PKB , with only limited loss of ligand efficiency. A further improvement in potency is obtained by incorporating a chloro substituent in the 4-position of the phenyl ring, as is shown for compounds 8 and 9 in Figure 1. Again, a 10-fold improvement in potency is achieved, and the high ligand efficiency of the compounds is maintained. The X-ray structures of compounds 8 and 9 (Figure 2c,e) reveal that the chlorophenyl group forms hydrophobic contacts with the lipophilic pocket as expected. In the crystal structure of racemic 8 with PKA-PKB, only the (R)-enantiomer 8a was observed. Chromatographic resolu-

tion of 8 subsequently confirmed that the (R)-enantiomer 8a was 10-fold more active than the (S)-enantiomer 8b and the binding mode of 8a was identical to that observed for the racemate. The protein-ligand structure of the (S)-enantiomer 8b, while maintaining the interactions with the hinge region, does not occupy the lipophilic pocket. Instead, the chlorophenyl is directed toward the side chain of Tyr330 (see Figure 2d). The analogous 4-chloro-substituted compound 9 adopts a similar binding mode in PKA-PKB to that observed for 8a, but has the advantage of being achiral. As a final confirmation step, we determined the protein-ligand structure of 9 with PKB (see Figure 2f). Although there are subtle changes in the conformation of the piperidine ring, the inhibitor adopts essentially the same binding mode in both PKA-PKB and PKB . The gross binding mode of 9 is comparable to that of a related 6-phenylpurine discovered through parallel optimization of an azaindole fragment hit.20 A Free-Wilson analysis21 of the SAR data in Figure 3 allowed us to estimate how the potency of compound 8a is distributed throughout the molecule. Group contributions to the free energy, dG, for the various parts of the compound are also listed in this figure. It is inappropriate to directly use the potency of the simple heterocycle pyrazole as the dG of the pyrazole group in compound 8a. This is because the free energy of binding of the compound also contains the free energy associated with the loss of rigid body entropy on binding to the enzyme, that is, G ) Gint + Grigid. In this equation, Gint is the intrinsic binding affinity of the compound and includes favorable terms (such as hydrogen bonds) and unfavorable terms (such as freezing rotatable bonds) and Grigid is the free energy associated with the loss of rigid body entropy on binding to the enzyme. We have shown in a recent study that this penalty can be considerable: approximately 4.2 kcal/mol, that is, about 2-3 orders of magnitude in potency.22 To bring the pyrazole contribution onto the same scale as the other dG terms in Figure

Figure 3. Free-Wilson analysis of the SAR around compound 8a, resulting group contributions dG and group efficiencies, GE. The different functional groups are defined according to the color scheme provided on the left. On the right, the binding mode of compound 8a is shown, with the atoms of the compound color coded according to their group efficiencies.

3, this rigid-body barrier to binding was, therefore, subtracted from the free energy of binding of pyrazole. This simple analysis reveals that the majority of the intrinsic binding affinity of compound 8a resides in the pyrazole. This finding is consistent with observations that the potency of a compound is often unevenly distributed throughout the molecule and in many cases concentrated in an "anchor fragment".23 The dG values can be converted into "group efficiencies" (GE), which are defined analogously to ligand efficiencies as GE ) -dG/HAC, where HAC is the number of nonhydrogen atoms in a particular group. Again, to stay within drug-like space, an approximate guideline of GE g 0.3 is used. The group efficiencies highlight the fact that the 4-chloro substituent on the terminal phenyl ring has been a particularly efficient addition. Analyses like these can be useful to prioritize compounds and to assess which regions of the binding site should be explored to optimize potency.24 Figure 3 also shows the X-ray binding mode of compound 8a color-coded according to the GE values of the functional groups. Subsequently, we discovered that compound 10 (Figure 4) still has a reasonable potency (77 µM) and acceptable ligand efficiency, even though it lacks the pyrazole that forms the key interactions with the hinge region. The (R)-enantiomer of 10 adopts a similar binding mode to the fully elaborated compounds, with the chlorophenyl occupying the lipophilic pocket. However, there is some disorder in the structure of 10 and evidence for a small population of chlorophenyl binding toward the hinge. This could be interpreted both as binding of the (S)enantiomer of 10 (which was present as the racemate) and/or an alternate binding mode of the (R)-enantiomer. Compound 8a is essentially a combination of compounds 10 and pyrazole. It is interesting to retrospectively assess how

efficiently the "linking" of these two fragments was done had this been a fragment-linking exercise. If two fragments are linked, superadditivity of their potencies may be observed, as the combined compound only pays the rigid-body penalty to binding once, whereas the fragments each have to overcome this barrier individually. When two fragments are linked ideally, the combined compound can be 2-3 orders of magnitude more potent than would be expected based on the potencies of the individual fragments.22 Simply adding the free energies of binding of compounds 10 and pyrazole gives -9.0 kcal/mol. The actual free energy of binding of compound 8a is -10.8 kcal/mol, implying that superadditivity was indeed achieved and that the fragments were "linked" efficiently. Nevertheless, the extra -1.8 kcal/mol gained by linking the two compounds is less than might be expected when two fragments are linked ideally. There are several factors that could have contributed to this: (i) compound 10 shows some disorder in the X-ray structure (see above) and this could have increased the potency of compound 10; (ii) an extra rotational bond has been introduced by linking the compounds, which is frozen out when compound 8a binds to the protein; (iii) linking the two fragments could have affected the electronics of the ring systems and hence their interaction with the protein; and (iv) the overlay of compounds 8a with 10 is imperfect (see Figure 4), linking 10 to the pyrazole shifts it higher up in the pocket, inevitably losing some of this potency. In summary, fragment-based drug discovery using our Pyramid platform has facilitated the rapid identification of novel, low molecular weight (<350 Da) PKB/Akt inhibitors. By applying protein-ligand crystallography to iterative structurebased design we have successfully elaborated an initial fragment hit 1 into nanomolar PKB inhibitors 8a and 9. In addition, by using a Free-Wilson analysis, we have been able to estimate the binding efficiency of the individual functional groups in compound 8a, with a view to directing further optimization.
