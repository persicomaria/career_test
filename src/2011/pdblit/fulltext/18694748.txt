12-Oxophytodienoate reductase 3 (OPR3) is a FMN-dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of the cyclopentenone (9S,13S)-12oxophytodienoate [(9S,13S)-OPDA] to the corresponding cyclopentanone in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone jasmonic acid. In vitro, however, OPR3 reduces the jasmonic acid precursor (9S,13S)-OPDA as well as the enantiomeric (9R,13R)-OPDA, while its isozyme OPR1 is highly selective, accepting only (9R,13R)-OPDA as a substrate. To uncover the molecular determinants of this remarkable enantioselectivity, we determined the crystal structures of OPR1 and OPR3 in complex with the ligand phydroxybenzaldehyde. Structural comparison with the OPR1:(9R,13R)OPDA complex and further biochemical and mutational analyses revealed that two active-site residues, Tyr78 and Tyr246 in OPR1 and Phe74 and His244 in OPR3, are critical for substrate filtering. The relatively smaller OPR3 residues allow formation of a wider substrate binding pocket that is less enantio-restrictive. Substitution of Phe74 and His244 by the corresponding OPR1 tyrosines resulted in an OPR3 mutant showing enhanced, OPR1-like substrate selectivity. Moreover, sequence analysis of the OPR family supports the filtering function of Tyr78 and Tyr246 and allows predictions with respect to substrate specificity and biological function of thus far uncharacterized OPR isozymes. The discovered structural features may also be relevant for other stereoselective proteins and guide the rational design of stereospecific enzymes for biotechnological applications.

Introduction
12-Oxophytodienoate reductases (OPRs) are a small group of flavin-dependent oxidoreductases in plants related to old yellow enzyme (OYE) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.1,2 Their name is derived from OPR3 in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress), which catalyzes the reduction

of the cyclopentenone (9S,13S)-12-oxophytodienoate [(9S,13S)-OPDA] to the corresponding cyclopentanone (Fig. 1a) in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA).3,4 JA and its derivatives constitute a family of plant hormones, collectively called jasmonates, which serve multiple roles in plant defense and development. Initially known for their growth-inhibitory and senescence-promoting activities, jasmonates are now well

1268 established as signalling molecules in plant resistance responses against herbivores and pathogens, as well as numerous developmental processes including male and female reproductive development, the formation of tubers and glandular trichomes, tendril coiling, lacticifer differentiation, and seed germination.5 The requirement of OPR3 for JA biosynthesis is evident from the OPR3 single-gene loss-of-function mutant in Arabidopsis, which is jasmonate deficient, male sterile, and impaired in jasmonate-dependent gene expression.6,7 Consistent with the genetic data, the biochemical characterization of recombinant OPRs revealed that OPR3 in tomato and Arabidopsis and OPR3 orthologs in other species are unique in their ability to reduce (9S,13S)-OPDA, which is the only precursor of biologically active JA among the four possible OPDA stereoisomers.8­10 The characterization of different OPR isoforms allowed to distinguish two types of activities with respect to their specificity for OPDA stereoisomers: OPR3-like enzymes exhibit a relaxed substrate specificity and reduce both the (9S,13S)- and the (9R,13R)-enantiomers of OPDA. In contrast, OPR1like enzymes are highly selective, accepting only (9R,13R)-OPDA as a substrate (Fig. 1a). Like all members of the OYE family, OPR1 and OPR3 from S. lycopersicum and from A. thaliana

exhibit the frequently observed (/)8 barrel fold, in which the cylindrical eight-stranded parallel -sheet is surrounded by eight -helices (Fig. 1b).11­14 The FMN cofactor is bound noncovalently at the Cterminal end of the -barrel, where loops L1­L8 (loops are numbered according to the preceding strand, e.g., L8 follows 8) set up the active-site cavity above the FMN and the substrate specificity regions. The characteristic enzymatic feature of the OYE family is the ability to hydrogenate the olefinic bond of ,-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The reaction has been shown to proceed via a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism including NAD(P)H binding, reduction of FMN, release of NAD(P)+ , substrate binding, and reduction.15,16 The carbonyl group of the ,-unsaturated carbonyl substrate is fixed and oriented above the FMN by two strong hydrogen bonds to a conserved His/His or His/Asn pair that simultaneously activates the substrate's olefinic bond for hydride transfer from the reduced flavin. In most of the OYE family members, a tyrosine is positioned above the substrate that has been shown to act as the proton donor during substrate reduction in OYE.17 In the SlOPR1:(9R,13R)-OPDA complex structure, the cyclopentenone ring of OPDA binds into a small cavity above the FMN, where it is oriented by

1269 (Fig. 2b). The hydroxy oxygen of PHB, which has been shown to be deprotonated in the OYE:PHB complex,19 is positioned at exactly the same position as the substrate's carbonyl oxygen and forms strong hydrogen bonds to His187 and His190. In the OPR1: (9R,13R)-OPDA complex, these hydrogen bonds serve to orient and activate OPDA for hydride transfer. The aromatic ring of PHB forms stacking interactions with the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN comparable to the cyclopentenone ring of OPDA, and the aldehyde group of PHB mimics the carboxy alkyl chain of OPDA by binding to the tunnel in the specificity region of OPR1. In OPR3, PHB is bound in a similar arrangement above the FMN, with its hydroxy oxygen being in close contact to the two catalytic histidine residues (Fig. 2c). However, one obvious difference is the orientation of the aromatic ring of PHB relative to the FMN isoalloxazine ring. In OPR1, the PHB ring is tilted about 15° against the flavin ring system, whereas in the OPR3:PHB complex, both ring systems are arranged parallel with each other. The different orientation correlates with a slight shift of the entire ligand towards the protein interior in OPR1 thereby anchoring it more deeply in the active-site pocket. The distinct PHB binding modes can be explained by several structural features: (1) Whereas in OPR1 the bulky Tyr246 forms part of the entrance of the substrate binding pocket, OPR3 employs the relatively smaller His244 yielding a larger and sterically less restrictive binding cavity. (2) In OPR1, a parallel arrangement of PHB and FMN is precluded by Tyr358 that extends directly above one of the FMN methyl groups towards the active-site cavity. In contrast, the equivalent Tyr370 of OPR3 is shifted slightly to a more remote region thereby freeing additional space above the FMN cofactor needed for parallel stacking interactions of FMN and PHB. Moreover, Tyr370 is in the proper position to allow the formation of a short-distanced (2.5 Å) hydrogen bond between its hydroxy group and the aldehyde group of the PHB. (3) Unlike in OPR1, PHB is bound to the FMN of OPR3 via its si-face, resulting in the observed opposite orientation of the aldehyde group. This binding mode is enforced by Phe74 of OPR3. Whereas its OPR1 counterpart (Tyr78) forms part of the ceiling at the entrance of the cavity, Phe74 is shifted slightly downwards with its phenyl group rotated towards the inner cavity, thereby preventing formation of an OPR1-like specificity tunnel for the substrate's alkyl chain. Simultaneously, this rotation increases the size of the cyclopentenone binding pocket. In sum, the structural data suggest that the gatekeeping OPR3 residues Phe74 and His244 (Tyr78 and Tyr246 in OPR1) together with Tyr370 (Tyr358 in OPR1) determine the binding mode of PHB and might thus be critical factors for substrate specificity. Stereoselectivity of the OPR double mutant Phe74Tyr/His244Tyr To probe the role of Phe74 and His244 as a substrate filtering device, an enzyme­substrate complex of OPR3 and (9R,13R)-OPDA was modeled. To this

hydrogen bonds to His187 and His190 for hydride transfer from the cofactor and for protonation by Tyr192.11 The substrate is further fixed by its carboxy alkyl chain binding into a tunnel formed by loop L3 of SlOPR1 (Fig. 1b). Despite the high degree of sequence identity between OPR1 and OPR3 (SlOPR1/SlOPR3: 55.5% for 375 aligned residues), the structural similarity (rmsd: 0.86 Å for 342 aligned Cs), as well as the strict conservation of all residues in the interior of the active-site cavity, OPR1 and OPR3 differ remarkably in their ability to reduce the four stereoisomers of OPDA. To uncover the molecular determinants that underlie this difference in substrate stereoselectivity, we have determined the structures of SlOPR1 and SlOPR3 complexed with p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (PHB) as a substrate analogue. Biochemical and structural analysis of several site-directed mutants revealed two active-site residues that are critical for substrate specificity in the family of OPR enzymes.

Results and Discussion
Complex formation of para-hydroxybenzaldehyde with OPR1 and OPR3 To study the molecular parameters that underlie the distinct substrate preferences of OPR1 and OPR3, we aimed to analyze the structure of OPR1 and OPR3 from S. lycopersicum in complex with substrate (when not otherwise mentioned, OPR1 and OPR3 refer to the S. lycopersicum enzymes). As reported previously, the OPR1:(9R,13R)-OPDA complex was determined at high resolution by soaking OPR1 crystals with substrate.11 However, OPR3 crystallizes as a selfinhibited dimer, in which the substrate binding pocket is occupied by loop L6 of the neighboring protomer.12 This may explain the failure to soak the OPDA substrate into OPR3 crystals. Since cocrystallization trials were also not successful, we tried to obtain a complex structure with the ligand PHB, which forms a charge-transfer complex with FMN, characteristic for the OYE family.18­20 PHB was chosen because of its good solubility and (i) it is a cyclic compound like OPDA; (ii) binding of its oxyanion in the OYE:PHB complex resembles binding of the OPDA carbonyl group in the OPR1:(9R,13R)OPDA complex; and (iii) its aldehyde substitution in para position extends the phenol ring comparable to the alkyl chains in OPDA. We soaked the OPR3 crystals in a crystallization solution saturated with PHB (N 100 mM) and determined the structure of the resulting OPR3:PHB complex by molecular replacement at 2.0-Å resolution (Table 1). In parallel, we solved the crystal structure of the OPR1:PHB complex at 2.3-Å resolution (Table 1). In both structures, the PHB ligand is well defined by electron density (Fig. 2a) and allowed a direct comparison of ligand binding in OPR1 and OPR3. In the OPR1 complex structure, the orientation of PHB closely resembles that of (9R,13R)-OPDA

end, the OPR1:(9R,13R)-OPDA structure was superimposed onto OPR3 and then used as a template from which the coordinates of the OPDA substrate were transferred to the active site of OPR3 (Fig. 3). Comparison of both structures illustrated the particular importance of the two gatekeeping

residues. In the OPR1:(9R,13R)-OPDA complex structure, Tyr78 and Tyr246 delimit the narrow substrate binding cavity in which the cyclopentenone ring, including the two stereo centers, as well as the neighboring C8 and C14 methylene groups of the extending alkyl chains, is completely buried (Fig.

1271 and the reaction was even slower in the Phe74Tyr/ His244Tyr double mutant (Fig. 4a). These findings are consistent with the interpretation of the structural data suggesting that the bulkier tyrosine residues impair proper binding of the (9S,13S)-enantiomer to the OPR3 active-site cavity. To test whether the impaired reduction of (9S,13S)-OPDA by the sitedirected OPR3 mutants is due to an overall loss of enzymatic activity, or else, an enhanced stereoselectivity for the (9R,13R)-enantiomer, the recombinant enzymes were analyzed with a racemic mixture of (9S,13S)-OPDA and (9R,13R)-OPDA as the substrate. The reaction was stopped after 30 min and the relative consumption of the two stereoisomers was analyzed. In contrast to wild-type OPR3, for which each of the two isomers represented 50% of all the substrate consumed, the single and double mutants showed a clear preference for (9R,13R)-OPDA over (9S,13S)OPDA (Fig. 4b). Apparently, replacement of Phe74

3a). In contrast, the entrance to the active-site cavity of OPR3, which is bordered by the relatively smaller Phe74 and His244, is much wider. In the modeled substrate complex, the cyclopentenone ring is less buried and the position of the stereo centers is less restricted than in OPR1 (Fig. 3b). Therefore, the modeling studies support the assumption that the two smaller gatekeeping residues are responsible for the broader substrate specificity of OPR3. To test this hypothesis, we generated the two OPR3 mutants Phe74Tyr and His244Tyr as well as the double mutant Phe74Tyr/His244Tyr (OPR3YY), which is predicted to confer an OPR1-like substrate specificity to OPR3. The mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and analyzed with respect to their ability to reduce (9S,13S)-OPDA (Fig. 4). Both the Phe74Tyr and the His244Tyr single mutants were similarly impaired in the reduction of (9S,13S)-OPDA,

The complex was obtained by transferring the substrate's coordinates of the aligned OPR1:(9R,13R)-OPDA complex to the OPR3 structure. Protein residues of OPR3 and the substrate's carboxy alkyl chain (shortened in the figure for clarity) clash in the model because OPR3 lacks the tunnel that accommodates the carboxy alkyl chain in OPR1. In OPR3, these clashes can be easily avoided by a change in the conformation of atoms C1 to C8 of the carboxy alkyl chain. In comparison to OPR1, the opening of the OPR3 cavity is lined by His244 and Phe74, resulting in a wider entrance and leaving more space near the stereo centers of the substrate.

At the indicated time points, the reactions were stopped and the reaction product dihydro-OPDA (DH-OPDA) was quantified by GC­MS. Product formation is given in percent of the initial amount of substrate. The data points represent the mean of two experiments. (b) Stereoselectivity of OPR3 wild-type enzyme and site-directed mutants. Racemic cisOPDA (0.2 mM) was offered as substrate to the wild-type form of SlOPR3 (wt) and to site-directed mutants. The relative consumption of (9S,13S)-OPDA (gray bars) and (9R,13R)-OPDA (black bars) was analyzed after 30 min by GC­MS and is indicated as percent of the total amount of substrate reduced. In three experiments, with enzyme concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 g/ml, the total amount of substrate that was consumed during the 30-min reaction increased with the enzyme concentration (not shown). Regardless of the enzyme concentration, a similar increase in stereoselectivity was observed for the mutant as compared to the wild-type enzymes. The data represent the mean of the three experiments, and error bars indicate the SD.

and His244 of OPR3 by the corresponding residues of OPR1 resulted in an enhanced substrate enantioselectivity as observed for OPR1.

To investigate the structural basis of the increased selectivity, we crystallized OPR3YY and determined the structure at 2.3-Å resolution (Supplementary Fig. S1; Table 1). Interestingly, the protein crystallized as a monomer with none of the dimer interactions retained. Loop L6, which blocks the active site of the molecular neighbor in wild-type OPR3, was flexible and not defined by electron density in OPR3YY. Overall, the structure of OPR3YY was more similar to the structures of the monomeric Tyr364Phe and Glu291Lys mutants12 than to the wild-type OPR3. The rms deviations for 358­367 Cs were 0.18, 0.19, and 0.30 Å, respectively. Structural alignment of wildtype OPR3 and OPR3YY showed that replacement of His244 by tyrosine prevents binding of loop L6 to the substrate binding cavity, which is a prerequisite for dimerization in OPR3. The introduced tyrosine side chain would clash with Glu291 of loop L6 of the partner protomer and thus impedes the interaction of this glutamate with the two active-site histidines His185 and His188. As was shown for the Glu291Lys mutant, these interactions are essential for anchoring loop L6 in the substrate binding pocket of the molecular neighbor.12 Otherwise, the introduced tyrosines did not induce significant rearrangements of the protein backbone and retained the same orientation as the original residues (Fig. 2c). However, the two tyrosines are much bulkier and therefore restrict the opening of the active site significantly. Together with Tyr190, they are arranged in a triangular fashion and form the ceiling of the substrate binding pocket. The three hydroxy groups are located in the center of the tyrosine triad and interact with each other via a wedged water molecule. Particularly, the tyrosine replacing His244 narrows the space in the cyclopentenone binding site and should restrict the possible configurations of the alkyl chains of the OPDA substrate (Fig. 2c). Thus, the structural data indicate that tightening of the substrate binding pocket by introducing the relatively bulkier tyrosine residues enhances the stereoselectivity of OPR3, although it does not allow to fully discriminate between (9R-13R)-OPDA and (9S-13S)-OPDA enantiomers. Another feature expected to influence substrate specificity is the OPR1 binding site for the carboxy alkyl chain of the OPDA substrate. This alkyl chain is bound in a hydrophobic tunnel, where it makes numerous van der Waals contacts with bordering hydrophobic residues, predominantly with the aromatic rings of Tyr78 and Tyr358, which sandwich the substrate's carboxy alkyl chain. Due to the different orientation of Phe74, the OPR3 equivalent of Tyr78 in OPR1, and the different conformation of loop L3, this tunnel is not formed in OPR3. In the OPR3YY double mutant, the Tyr74 side chain retains the OPR3-typical conformation and continues to block access to the specificity region that anchors the OPDA carboxy alkyl chain in OPR1. The importance of the conformation of this aromatic residue is corroborated by the recent discovery of isozyme-specific stereocontrol in the reduction of 1-nitro-2-phenylpropene by OPR1 and OPR3.21 Docking of the small prochiral nitroalkene indicated

1273 The present structures also illustrate a further, more general feature important for stereospecific catalysis. Ligand binding to OPR1 and OPR3 solely induces minor adjustments in the individual active sites, pointing to a rigid, quasi pre-formed substrate binding pocket. This rigidity might be crucial to avoid binding of the "wrong" isomer, which could

that the different orientation of Phe74 in OPR1 and Tyr78 in OPR3 determines the substrate binding mode in the active site resulting in opposite enantiomeric products.21 Therefore, the active site of OPR3YY combines characteristics of both OPR1 and OPR3 active sites, allowing partial distinction between different OPDA enantiomers.

1274 be eased by a plastic, flexible active site. In OPR1, the rigidity of the active site is supported by an extensive hydrogen-bonding network, including Asn247, Gln140, Tyr192, and Tyr78. The rigidity of both OPR active sites is also evident from the analysis of thermal motion factors, as the B-factors of the substrate binding residues are significantly smaller than the average B-factor of all protein residues [OPR3:PHB, 15.2 Å2 in active-site cavity, 20.9 Å2 in average; OPR3(Glu291Lys) (active site filled with water), 15.5 and 19.4 Å2; OPR1:PHB, 31.2 and 34.2 Å2; OPR1, 35.2 and 37.9 Å2]. Determinants of substrate specificity within the OPR family Based on phylogenetic analyses, the family of OPR-like plant enzymes can be divided into two subgroups.22­24 All OPR enzymes that, like OPR3, are able to reduce the JA precursor (9S,13S)-OPDA (AtOPR3, 8 SlOPR3, 9 and OsOPR7 10 ) belong to subgroup II, whereas enzymes exhibiting the pronounced OPR1-like substrate specificity are found in subgroup I (AtOPR1, AtOPR2, 8 SlOPR1, 9 and OsOPR122). Throughout both subgroups, residues fixing the FMN cofactor are extensively conserved, as are the catalytic His/His (His/Asn) pair and the proton donor Tyr190 (Fig. 5). In addition, Trp108 and Thr33 within the active-site cavity are conserved in most of the OPR-like enzymes. A characteristic feature of all enzymes of subgroup II is a seven-residue extension of loop L6 that is critical for dimer formation of OPR3. With the single exception of Ala292, all the L6 residues contributing to the dimerization interface are strictly conserved in subgroup II but do not exist in subgroup I (Fig. 5). The present findings identified two further residues, Phe74 and His244, as a subgroup II signature motif that is required to reduce the JA precursor (9S,13S)OPDA. The strict conservation of this motif suggests that hitherto biochemically uncharacterized members of OPR subgroup II will also be able to reduce (9S,13S)-OPDA and thereby take part in JA biosynthesis (Fig. 5). In the majority of OPR enzymes of subfamily I, these two residues are replaced by two tyrosines, corresponding to Tyr78 and Tyr246 in OPR1. The six OPR genes of P. sativum that have been identified so far all belong to subgroup I.23 Interestingly, Tyr78

and Tyr246 are not conserved in the isozymes PsOPR4 and PsOPR5. Whereas PsOPR5 might be a silenced pseudogene, PsOPR4 expression is induced by different cues (e.g., by the JA mimic coronatine or leaf detachment), and recombinantly produced PsOPR4 actively reduces 2-cyclohexen-1-one. In PsOPR4, Tyr78 and Tyr246 are substituted by two smaller residues (Leu and Phe, respectively), which is predicted to result in a wider opening of the substrate binding cavity as in OPR3. Therefore, PsOPR4 is a candidate enzyme for the reduction of (9S,13S)-OPDA in the pathway for JA biosynthesis in pea. Similarly, the recently sequenced genome of P. patens26 contains seven OPR-like genes, none of which belongs to subgroup II. Yet, in five of the seven predicted gene products, Tyr246 is replaced by a smaller residue. In one of the five, the second gatekeeping residue (Tyr78) is replaced by phenylalanine and can thus be identified as a candidate for an OPR3-like activity for JA biosynthesis (Fig. 5). Conclusion OPRs are flavoenzymes that can reduce a concise set of substituted cyclopentenones differing only in the chirality of their two substituted ring carbons. Thereby, different OPR isozymes exhibit clearly defined and distinct substrate stereoselectivities, although they show a high sequence identity and employ a conserved set of catalytic residues to hydrogenate the olefinic C­C bond of their substrates. Consequently, substrate specificity appears to be determined by a few key residues in the active site. The present study aimed to identify these molecular determinants using OPR1 and OPR3 from tomato as a model system. Following a structural­biochemical approach, we identified two active-site residues that function as a substrate filter and enable OPR enzymes to distinguish between the (9R,13R)-OPDA and (9S,13S)-OPDA enantiomers. Mutation of these two key residues conveyed OPR1-like stereoselectivity to the unspecific OPR3 enzyme. Subsequent sequence analysis of OPR enzymes from different organisms indicated their general specificity-determining role. We showed that these residues delimit the size of the active-site cavity, in particular its entrance region, and thus contribute essentially to the selection of substrates. The structural data further suggest that this ligand binding pocket is a comparably rigid structure

Fig. 5. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of OPR1- and OPR3-like enzymes. Enzymes that belong to OPR subgroup II are shown in the upper rows of the alignment (OsOPR7: Oryza sativa OPR7 according to Tani et al.10 OsOPR13,25 Os08g0459600; ZmOPR8: Zea mays OPR8, gi|162462945; ZmOPR7: gi|162460824; HbOPR: Hevea brasiliensis OPR, gi|63029722; Vvhyp1: Vitis vinifera hypothetical protein, gi|147781156; Vvhyp2: V. vinifera unnamed protein product, gi|157342548). Enzymes of subgroup I (OsOPR1: Os06g0216300; Pisum sativum OPR4:Q76FR8) as well as an OPR-like hypothetical protein from Physcomitrella patens (gi|162681370) are shown below. The secondary structural elements of SlOPR3 are depicted below the alignment. Residues that are strictly conserved through both subgroups are shaded in blue; well-conserved residues are in light blue. Residues that are strictly conserved in subgroup II or I are shaded in orange or green, respectively, and conservatively substituted residues are in yellow or light green, respectively. The two specificity-determining residues Phe74/Tyr78 and His244/Tyr246 are marked by red arrows. Residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis (marked by a green filled circle) and residues important for FMN binding (marked by an open triangle) are completely conserved in all sequences, except for Vvhyp1. Additionally, among subgroup II enzymes, residues that bind to the substrate binding cavity of their dimerization partner in LeOPR3 (marked by an open circle) are completely conserved.

and of the OPR3YY double mutant were solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe31 and the uncomplexed structures of OPR1 and OPR3 as search models. Energy-restrained crystallographic refinement was carried out with maximum likelihood algorithms implemented in CNS32 using the protein parameters of Engh and Huber.33 Refinement, model rebuilding with the program O,34 and water incorporation proceeded smoothly via rigidbody, positional, and later B-factor optimization. The entire structure was checked with simulated annealing composite omit maps. The FMN cofactor, the PHB ligands, and the mutated residues were not included in the model during the first cycles of refinement; thereafter, they could be easily built into the clearly defined electron density. With the exception of 6­10 N-terminal and 11­12 C-terminal residues as well as 8­14 residues of loop L6, all OPR1 and OPR3 residues could be traced in the electron density map and exhibited good stereochemistry (Table 1). All parameter and topology files were generated with the program XPLO2D35 and graphical presentations were prepared with MOLSCRIPT,36 GRASP,37 and Raster3D.38 The amino acid sequence alignment was produced with CLUSTALW39,40 and depicted with ALSCRIPT.41 Analysis of stereospecificity in OPR3 mutants The activity of OPR3 and the site-directed mutants (Phe74Tyr, His244Tyr, Phe74Tyr/His244Tyr--OPR3; 1 g each) with (9S,13S)-OPDA (0.1 mM) as the substrate was monitored over time. The reaction was performed in a total volume of 1 ml in the presence of 1 mM NADPH at pH 7.5 (100 mM phosphate buffer). At the indicated time points (Fig. 4), the reaction was stopped by acidification (HCl; pH b 3) and the formation of DH-OPDA was analyzed by gas chromatography­mass spectrometry (GC­MS) according to Zerbe et al.42 Briefly, DH-OPDA was extracted in diethylether, and the extract evaporated to dryness. After methylation, dried fractions were redissolved in 100 l of chloroform, and 1 l of the sample was injected into a Varian GC 3400 gas chromatograph (Varian, Darmstadt, Germany) in splitless mode in direct connection to a MAT Magnum ion-trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan, Bremen, Germany) using a chemical ionization mode with methanol as reactant gas. A ZB-35 fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany; 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 m film thickness) with He carrier gas at 1 ml/min (gas pre-pressure of 80 kPa) was used for separation using the following temperature program: injector temperature of 260 °C, 1 min isothermally at 50 °C, with 20 °C/min up to 250 °C, 10 min isothermally at 250 °C, transferline temperature 260 °C. For analysis of stereoselectivity, varying amounts of enzyme (1­100 g) were analyzed with 0.2 mM of racemic mixture of (9S,13S)-OPDA and (9R,13R)-OPDA as the substrate under the same reaction conditions. The reaction was terminated after 30 min and residual substrate enantiomers were analyzed by GC­MS as described by Laudert et al. and Schaller et al. using a -Dex120 column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.15 m stationary-phase thickness) coated with 20% permethyl--cyclodextrin in SPB-35 (Supelco, Deisenhofen, Germany) with He carrier gas at 1 ml/min (gas pre-pressure of 80 kPa).43,44 At all protein concentrations used for activity measurements, OPR3 was predominantly monomeric and therefore fully active.

able to discriminate between closely related substrate molecules. OPR1 and OPR3 are interesting candidates for asymmetric catalysis as they are able to asymmetrically reduce various activated alkenes with high, in part complementary, enantiomeric excess.21,27,28 Our results show that directed mutagenesis of the gatekeeping residues Phe74 and His244 leads to a change in substrate specificity while retaining enzyme activity, and thus represent a valuable starting point for enlarging the range of possible substrates and eventually the enantiomeric excess for biotechnological use. In addition, mutation of these two residues is a promising strategy when trying to enhance substrate enantioselectivity of non-prochiral substrates such as OPDA, which would allow the use of OPR enzymes for the chiral separation of enantiomers by enzymatic resolution.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization of the OPR3YY mutant and OPR complexes with PHB OPR1 and OPR3 were expressed and purified as described previously.12,29 The OPR3YY double mutant was generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. The mutant was purified using the same protocol as for the wild-type protein. All crystallization trials were carried out in Cryschem plates (reservoir volume of 500 l) at 19 °C using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of wild-type OPR3 were grown by mixing 3 l of protein with 1.5 l of a crystallization solution containing 100 mM Mes/Tris (pH 6.5), 16% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8000, and 50 mM ammonium sulfate. For structural analysis of the OPR3:PHB complex, it was essential to soak crystals in a saturated solution. Thus, the PHB inhibitor was added in solid form to a crystallization drop containing freshly grown crystals of OPR3. The crystals were incubated overnight until a color change from yellow to red indicated the formation of a charge-transfer complex between FMN and PHB.19,20 Crystals of OPR1 were grown as described previously.11 For generation of the OPR1:PHB complex, crystals of OPR1 were soaked in PEG400-free crystallization solution and then transferred to PEG400-free crystallization solution complemented with 10 mM PHB. Crystals of the OPR3YY double mutant were grown in 96-well plates (100 l reservoir) by mixing 200 nl of protein (25 mg/ml) with 100 nl of crystallization solution containing 1 M (NH4)2HPO4, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5). For cryo measurements, crystals were transferred from the crystallization drop to the mother liquor supplied with 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (OPR3) and 30­35% glycerol (OPR1 and OPR3YY) as cryoprotectant and rapidly frozen in a 100 K stream of nitrogen gas. Structure solution and refinement High-resolution data of OPR3 and OPR1 complexed with PHB were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility synchrotron (beamline ID14-4,  = 0.9393 Å) using a Q4R ADSC CCD detector. Data were integrated using DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK.30 The crystal structures of the OPR1:PHB and OPR3:PHB complexes
