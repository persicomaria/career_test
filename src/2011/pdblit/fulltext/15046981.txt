Abstract Extra- and intracellular viruses in the biosphere outnumber their cellular hosts by at least one order of magnitude. How is this enormous domain of viruses organized? Sampling of the virosphere has been scarce and focused on viruses infecting humans, cultivated plants, and animals as well as those infecting well-studied bacteria. It has been relatively easy to cluster closely related viruses based on their genome sequences. However, it has been impossible to establish long-range evolutionary relationships as sequence homology diminishes. Recent advances in the evaluation of virus architecture by high-resolution structural analysis and elucidation of viral functions have allowed new opportunities for establishment of possible long-range phylogenic relationships--virus lineages. Here, we use a genomic approach to investigate a proposed virus lineage formed by bacteriophage PRD1, infecting gram-negative bacteria, and human adenovirus. The new member of this proposed lineage, bacteriophage Bam35, is morphologically indistinguishable from PRD1. It infects gram-positive hosts that evolutionarily separated from gram-negative bacteria more than one billion years ago. For example, it can be inferred from structural analysis of the coat protein sequence that the fold is very similar to that of PRD1. This and other observations made here support the idea that a common early ancestor for Bam35, PRD1, and adenoviruses existed. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Introduction It is evident that there are approximately 10-fold more viruses than cognate host cells in the biosphere (Bergh et al., 1989; Wommack and Clowell, 2000). All cellular organisms are subject to virus infection. How is this enormous domain of viruses organized? Our current sampling of the virosphere has focused mostly on animal and plant patho-

gens, and bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) infecting a small number of commonly studied bacteria. This has led to the usage of host specificity, as well as phenotypic comparisons, as the basis for virus classification. It is considered that despite horizontal gene transfer there are constraints that conserve key structures (and functions) comprising the viral innate "self." Viruses sharing recognizable similar self-structures would form a lineage (Bamford et al., 2002a; Bamford, 2003). Although advances in computational methods have made a tremendous impact on the analysis, annotation, and interpretation of biological data, the methods tend to break down when dealing with data that originate from a new or less sampled branch of the tree of life. Sequence comparisons are relevant only between viruses that are closely enough related to allow similarities to be recognized and followed.

When deeper penetration into evolutionary time is necessary, more extensive methods are required. An increase in the number of high-resolution structures of viruses and viral coat components allow for the comparison of morphologic data at atomic-level resolution. Surprisingly, it has been observed that viruses infecting hosts from different domains of life share a number of unexpected similarities. The most illustrative examples are the similarities discovered between adenoviruses (Burnett, 1997) and phage PRD1, the prototype of Tectiviridae (Bamford and Ackermann, 2000). The similarities extend from genome replication to capsid architecture (T 25) (Stewart et al., 1991; Butcher et al., 1995), and to the fold of the major coat protein (pseudo hexameric trimer with two eight-stranded -barrels in the monomer) (Rydman et al., 2001; Benson et al., 1999, 2002; Belnap and Steven, 2000). In addition, the vertex organization, with the pentamer and spike proteins, is similar (van Ostrum and Burnett, 1985; van Raaij et al., 1999; Bamford and Bamford, 2000; Caldentey et al., 2000; Sokolova et al., 2001). Thus far, this architecture has been elucidated only for these two viruses. These observations led to the hypothesis that viruses form evolutionary lineages dating to a common ancestor that existed before the division into the three domains of life (Benson et al., 1999; Hendrix, 1999; Bamford et al., 2002a; Bamford, 2003). To support the concept of evolutionary viral lineages, the sample sizes evaluated must be increased. Structural analysis of the Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus (PBCV-1) that infects unicellular, eukaryotic, chlorella-like green algae (Van Etten et al., 1991; Van Etten and Meints, 1999; Yan et al., 2000), demonstrated a similar architectural organization to that of PRD1. The high-resolution structure of the coat protein has been solved very recently (Nandhagopal et al., 2003), revealing that the fold is very much the same as in the PRD1 coat protein. The family Tectiviridae (tectus, covered) includes bacteriophages having a membrane beneath the icosahedral protein shell. PRD1 infects a variety of gram-negative bacteria harboring P-, N-, or W-type conjugative plasmids (Olsen et al., 1974). PRD1 has five very closely related isolates: PR3 (Bradley and Rutherford, 1975), PR4 (Stanisich, 1974), PR5 (Wong and Bryan, 1978), PR772 (Coetzee and Bekker, 1979), and L17 (isolated by N. Seeley; Bamford and Ackermann, 2000). Although these phages have been isolated from different parts of the world, the genomic sequences are approximately 98% identical (J.K.H. Bamford, unpublished results). In addition to phages that infect gram-negative bacteria, three members infecting gram-positive Bacillus species have been reported: Bam35, infecting Bacillus thuringiensis (Ackermann et al., 1978; Bamford and Ackermann, 2000), AP50, infecting Bacillus anthracis (Nagy, 1974), and phiNS11, infecting Bacillus cereus (Bamford and Ackermann, 2000). The latter is not available anymore and the anthracis phage is not a desired model system; therefore, we optimized the growth and purification methods and analyzed the genome of

Bam35. The aim was to increase the sampling of the virosphere to find new members of the Tectivirus-adenovirus lineage. Although not accurately defined, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are considered to have diverged more than one billion years ago (Maidak et al., 2001; http:// rdp.cme.msu.edu/html/). Therefore, it would be of interest to compare the genome sequences of PRD1 and Bam35 to determine if any common elements exist. It also would be interesting to see if more recent horizontal gene transfer can be detected as proposed for other dsDNA phages (Hendrix et al., 2002; Pajunen et al., 2001; Tetart et al., 2001). Information on Bam35 is based on a single previous publication (Ackermann et al., 1978), whereas the PRD1 system has been described in considerable detail (Bamford et al., 1995). PRD1 has a linear 15-kb dsDNA genome with 5 covalently linked terminal proteins. The genome is replicated by a protein-priming sliding-back mechanism, similar to that of the adenoviruses (Savilahti et al., 1991; Caldentey et al., 1993). The viral particle has an outer diameter of 740 Å between opposite vertices (San Martin et al., 2001). The outer-most protein capsid is organized on a pseudo T 25 lattice with 240 copies of the trimeric coat protein (Butcher et al., 1995). Underneath the protein coat resides the viral membrane that is closely aligned with the icosahedral shape of the capsid (San Martin et al., 2001, 2002). The membrane vesicle encloses the genome. The capsid is composed of approximately 20 protein species, two of which (P3 and P30) from the coat skeleton (Mindich et al., 1982b; Bamford et al., 1991; Luo et al., 1993; Rydman et al., 2001). Three other proteins (P31, P5, and P2) form the receptor-binding spike structures at the particle vertices (Rydman et al., 1999; Grahn et al., 1999; Bamford and Bamford, 2000; Caldentey et al., 2000). The remaining proteins are membrane-associated and are involved in genome packaging and DNA delivery into the host cell (Mindich et al., 1982b; Stromsten et al., 2003; Grahn et al., ¨ 2002a,b). Recently, the entire 66 mDa PRD1 virion with the inner membrane and genomic DNA was crystallized (Bamford et al., 2002b), and determination of its high-resolution structure is underway. It is the largest virus, and the only one with a biological membrane, that has yielded diffracting crystals thus far. As determined by negative-stain electron microscopy, the Bam35 virion morphology (Ackermann et al., 1978) resembles that of PRD1. Here we describe methods used to obtain purified Bam35 particles in amounts that allow detailed biophysical and morphological characterization and comparison with PRD1. The purified particles were used to isolate and sequence the viral genome. Sequence analysis led to the conclusion that, despite the lack of sequence similarity to PRD1, these viruses are related based on their genomic organization and the characteristics of the predicted proteins. These similarities indicated that Bam35 and PRD1 may have had a common ancestor that existed before the separation of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria

and that Bam35 most probably is a member of the same lineage as PRD1, adenoviruses, and PBCV-1.

Results Optimization of the virus yield The wild-type Bam35 from the d'Herelle Reference Center formed turbid plaques on the host B. thuringiensis HER1410. The titer of soft agar derived phage stocks in Luria­Bertani medium (LB) did not exceed 3 109 PFU/ ml, making it difficult to obtain appropriate amounts of virus for further characterization. However, when the plates were carefully examined, approximately 5% of the plaques were found to be clear. Three clear plaques were picked and, after subsequent single plaque purifications, stocks were prepared. The plaque that gave the highest titer sloppy agar stock (3 1011 PFU/ml) was selected, designated Bam35c, and used in this study. The stability test (virus in LB at 4°C, Fig. 1) indicated a reasonably rapid decay of infectivity. This was taken into account when the growth and purification procedures were designed. The host cells aggregated at high cell density ( 4 108 CFU/ml) and thus densities were not allowed to exceed 3 108 CFU/ml during the liquid growth and titering experiments. The effect of cell density (between 1.2 108 and 3 108 CFU/ml) in one-step growth experiments was determined using a constant m.o.i. value of 10. The best lysis and highest virus yield was obtained when the cells were infected at 2 108 CFU/ml. The effect of m.o.i. was determined by keeping the cell density constant (2 108 CFU/ml) at the time of infection (Fig. 2). At low m.o.i. values (1) a dual growth curve was obtained, indicating that

The cells were grown to a cell density of 2 108 CFU/ml (150 Klett units) at 37°C and infected (time point 0) using different m.o.i. values. After lysis the titers were determined (given in parentheses). m.o.i. 1 (closed circles, 3 1010 PFU/ml), 10 (open circles, 4.5 1010 PFU/ml), 15 (closed triangles, 6.7 1010 PFU/ml), 20 (open triangles, 5.1 1010 PFU/ml), noninfected cells (closed squares). Turbidity (cell density) was measured using a Klett­Summerson colorimeter (A540).

initially released viruses were able to infect the uninfected cells, leading to complete but delayed lysis. Higher m.o.i. values ( 20) caused premature lysis. The highest yield was obtained with an effective m.o.i. of 15 using virus stocks that were less than 24 h old, as demonstrated by the titer decay shown in Fig. 1. Under optimal conditions the lysis started about 45 min post infection (p.i.) and was complete in 60 min. The lysate titers did not exceed 7 1010 PFU/ml. Thin-section electron microscopy, sampled throughout the one-step growth experiment (Fig. 3), revealed numerous empty particles tightly associated with the cell surface at 10 min p.i. Mature virus particles were centrally located within the cell at 40 min p.i. and cell lysis was occasionally captured at later time points. Bam35c purification The optimal growth conditions determined above were used to produce virus for purification. Due to virus decay, the growth and purification procedure used to obtain 1 virus was carried out in a single day. The normal polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (Yamamoto et al., 1970) precipitated extensive impurities. However, reducing the PEG concentration to 5% and reducing the centrifugation conditions (Sorvall SLA 3000, 8000 rpm, 10 min, 5°C) improved the purity. The rate zonal centrifugation (Fig. 4A) yielded two virus peaks with the same sedimentation behavior as those of filled and empty PRD1 particles. SDS­

specific peak was observed. The density of Bam35c in sucrose (1.21 g/ml) and CsCl (1.28 g/ml) was determined using the equilibrium gradient data (Figs. 4B and C). We also tested iodixanol (OptiPrep) gradients, but no separation of flagella and virus was achieved (data not shown). The observation that the flagellar zone of the CsCl gradient showed aggregation led to experiments to examine the effect of differential salt precipitation on flagellar aggregates. It was observed that flagella still precipitated quantitatively in 0.3 M ammonium sulfate, whereas only a small fraction of the virus was removed. Our current combined purification procedure includes PEG precipitation, rate-zonal sucrose gradient purification, ammonium sulfate precipitation of flagella, and isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation. The outcome of this purification scheme is illustrated in Table 1.

Comparison of the morphology, proteins, and DNA of Bam35c to those of PRD1 To illustrate the similarity of Bam35c and PRD1 particles, we prepared 1 purified material of both viruses. These purified particles were mixed 1:1 and subjected to negative-staining electron microscopy (Fig. 5). We could not distinguish these preparations. Both showed empty and filled particles and occasional empty tailed particles of the same size as described previously for both of these viruses (Ackerman et al., 1978; Grahn et al., 2002b). The Bam35c preparation could be distinguished only by the presence of flagellar contamination that is absent in the PRD1 preparation since a flagella-less host was used to produce particles. The protein patterns of purified PRD1 and Bam35c particles analyzed via SDS­PAGE are shown in Fig. 6. If a protein counterpart for PRD1 was found in Bam35c, it was designated using the PRD1 nomenclature (P for protein followed by an arabic number equal to the Roman numeral for the gene). The rest of the proteins are classified as gene products (gp) and numbered according to their correspond-

PAGE analysis indicated two major protein bands in both empty and filled particle fractions. N-terminal amino acid analysis of the lower band revealed the sequence, MRINTNINSM. A data bank search identified this sequence as identical to flagellins from B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis (Fig. 4A, arrowhead). Removal of the flagellar contamination using equilibrium centrifugation in sucrose failed (Fig. 4B, arrowhead). However, the virus material was readily separated from the flagella using isopycnic CsCl gradients (Fig. 4C). Unfortunately in this high ionic strength environment the virus dissociated in such a way that soluble (mostly coat protein) material was at the top of the gradient and aggregated material was found at the bottom. Only a small virus-

ing open reading frame (ORFs). For Bam35c, the most abundant protein (gp18), which presumably corresponds to the major virion coat protein, has a mass of approximately 40 kDa. The corresponding protein in PRD1 is the 43-kDa coat protein P3. The coat protein seems to have the highest mass among the Bam35c structural proteins, whereas in PRD1 the 60-kDa receptor-binding protein P2 migrates slower than the coat protein P3 and represents the uppermost band in the gel (Fig. 6). The second most abundant protein in Bam35c (gp25) also has a counterpart in PRD1 (22-kDa protein P11). The migration patterns of the minor proteins between P3 and P11 also seem to be quite similar, whereas the gel pattern for the smaller proteins, corresponding to the membrane-associated proteins for PRD1 (Bamford and Bamford, 1991), differ considerably (Fig. 6). Sequencing of the genome of Bam35c (see below) allowed us to search the predicted amino-terminal amino acid sequences of separated Bam35c proteins (Fig. 6). Of the approximately 12 protein bands detected in SDS­PAGE, 8 yielded sequences that could be identified at the beginning of an open reading frame. Four proteins (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 6A) did not yield any signal. The isolated genomic DNAs from Bam35c and PRD1 were analyzed in an agarose gel. Isolation of the DNA from PRD1 virions without protease treatment leaves the covalently linked terminal proteins attached and the DNA does not properly enter the agarose gel. After treatment with protease, the DNA migrates according to its molecular weight ( 15 kb). The DNA from Bam35c behaved as the PRD1 genome in this assay (Fig. 7). This indicated that Bam35c most probably has covalently linked terminal proteins at the ends of the genome and a similar length to the PRD1 genome.

Comparison of the Bam35c and PRD1 genomic sequences Sequencing of the Bam35c genome revealed a linear, 14,935-bp-long dsDNA molecule with an average GC content of 39.7%. The closest reported virus in the NCBI database in terms of the length is PRD1 with 14,927 bp and an average GC content of 48.1%. The longest inverted repeat for Bam35c was found to be the 74-bp-long repeat located at the genome termini. These Bam35c inverted terminal repeats (ITR) have 81% identity, whereas the 110bp-long ITRs of PRD1 have 100% identity (Fig. 8). The

ITR regions of PRD1 and Bam35c do not have any observable sequence similarity to each other. The overall nucleotide identity across the entire genome of Bam35c and PRD1 is 42% using both local and global alignments. Although the overall nucleotide identity is rather high, the actual alignment shows that the regions of identity is very patchy. The longest similar nucleotide "patch" has a length of only 32 nucleotides. Comparison of the ORFs and genome organization of Bam35c and PRD1 The GeneMark program predicted 32 ORFs longer in size than 100 bp that might code for proteins from Bam35c. All predicted ORFs are in the same DNA strand (Fig. 9). The genome is tightly packed having short noncoding regions and only a few overlapping ORFs. The PRD1 genome is similarly packed with few overlapping genes. The clearest difference in PRD1 with respect to Bam35c was that the early genes (XII and XIX coding for the DNA-binding proteins) are located in the opposite strand at the right end of the genome (Fig. 9) (Bamford et al., 1991). The total number of genes and ORFs in the PRD1 genome is 34 (Bamford et al., 1991, 2002b), which is very close to the number of predicted ORFs for Bam35c. Many of the Bam35c ORFs are quite short, similar to the PRD1 genes (Fig. 9). The shortest known genes shown to code for a protein in PRD1 are genes XX (coding for a 42-residues-long protein P20) and XXII (coding for a 47-residues-long protein P22). These are integral membrane proteins involved in the linking of the DNA packaging complex to the virion (Stromsten et al., ¨ 2003). The TMHMM program predicted a possible transmembrane helix for 10 of the putative gene products of Bam35c. This fits well with the corresponding number in

PRD1, which has eight proteins with transmembrane helices (Table 2). The Bam35c ORF5 (2207 bp), located near the left end of the genome, is the only one with enough coding capacity for a DNA polymerase (see below). The length of the second longest ORF is 1070 bp. In PRD1 there are two genes of approximately 1700 bp: I and II coding for the DNA polymerase P1, and the receptor-binding protein P2, respectively. This suggests that the ORF for the receptorbinding protein in Bam35c is much shorter than the analogous gene in PRD1. This result is in concordance with the SDS­PAGE pattern of the Bam35c virion structural proteins with no apparent bands larger than the coat protein P3 ( 40 kDa; Fig. 6). PSI-Blast searches were carried out for each of the Bam35c ORFs. As with PRD1, overall protein sequence identity is low between the predicted Bam35c protein sequences and protein sequences available in the current nonredundant SWISS-PROT database in the NCB data bank. Only five of the deduced proteins had hits with any relevance (Table 2). The highest similarity, which was to several polymerases, was observed for ORF 5, further confirming that it is the gene for the Bam35c DNA polymerase. Meanwhile, ORF 6 had sequence identity to the LexA-type DNA-binding proteins. This type of regulatory protein has not been characterized for PRD1. The product of ORF 14 had highest similarity (BLAST E-score: 1.0 10 66) to the PRD1 DNA packaging ATPase P9 (gene IX; Bamford et al., 1991). Due to the conserved nucleotide-binding, Walker A motif in the ORF 14 gene product, similarities with a few other ATPases were also discovered. Interestingly, ORF 14 and PRD1 gene IX are located in the corresponding regions, in front of the coat protein gene (Fig. 9). The ORF 26 product was found to have homology to peptidoglycanhydrolyzing enzymes from different organisms, mainly from gram-positive bacteria. The corresponding gene (VII) (Rydman and Bamford, 2000) of PRD1 is located after the coat protein gene in the region (OL3) coding for the virion structural proteins (Fig. 9). ORF 30 from Bam35 codes for another putative lytic enzyme that has homology to the endolysins and lysozymes of gram-positive bacteria but no homology to PRD1 genes. Almost all of the few similarities found using PSI-Blast were to PRD1 proteins. We continued the analysis by doing a separate all-against-all comparison directly between Bam35c

Fig. 9. Genome organization of Bam35c (top) and PRD1 (middle). The genome of PRD1 is organized in five operons (bottom), two of which are transcribed early (OE) and three late (OL) during the infection cycle (Grahn et al., 1994). The operon OE1 at the 5 end codes for the genome replication functions (genes VIII and I) and the host receptor-binding protein (gene II). The next operon, OL1, contains the genes for the penton and spike proteins (XXXI and V, respectively), which are at the virus vertices. The middle operon, OL2, encodes proteins for the assembly and DNA packaging functions and the third late operon, OL3, codes for the structural proteins of the virion. The OE2 is transcribed in the direction opposite to the rest of the operons and the genes (XII and XIX) in that operon are indicated in black. The Bam35c ORFs are assigned with Arabic numerals, PRD1 genes with Roman numerals, and PRD1 ORFs with lowercase letters.

ORFs and PRD1 genes and ORFs at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels. The alignments were done to ensure that any possible, even low similarity, regions of interest were detected. Still, none of the global or local alignments gave any significant matches beyond that already found in the PSI-Blast analysis (ORFs 5, 14, and 26). However, when the product of ORF 28 was aligned with PRD1 protein P5 using the Smith­ Waterman local alignment method, a match was found in the region containing several serine and glycine residues corresponding to the spike protein P5 collagen-like motif (Bamford and Bamford, 1990). This motif, with six collagen-type triplets, divides the spike protein into two domains and has a role in host receptor recognition (Huiskonen et al., 2003). There is no collagen-type triplets in the Bam35c ORF 28 product, but three triplets are found from the gene product encoded by the preceding gene (ORF 27), which might correspond, on the basis of its location, to the penton protein gene XXXI in PRD1. The sizes of the Bam35c ORF 28 product and PRD1 P5 protein are approximately the same (32 vs 34 kDa, respectively). We extended our analyses even further to include the 3D-PSSM method to test if any of the Bam35c gene products would match any known 3D protein structures. Only the amino acid sequences deduced from ORF 18 showed significant homology with the X-ray structure of the PRD1 major coat protein P3 (Benson et al., 2002; E-value 0.00525, 95% confidence interval). This result confirms that ORF 18 codes for the coat protein of Bam35c (see above) and that the fold is probably similar to that of the PRD1 coat protein even though there is no detectable nucleotide sequence level homology. Analysis of other viral coat protein sequences by the 3D-PSSM method resulted in another

interesting hit. The sequence of the PBCV-1 coat protein has some homology with the PRD1 coat protein structure, although with much a lower E-value (1.24) than Bam35c, arguing that the Bam35c coat protein-fold is even more similar to the PRD1 coat protein than that of PBCV-1 (Nandhagopal et al., 2003). Finally, the nucleotide frequency of Bam35c ORFs and PRD1 genes and ORFs was compared. Bam35c has a more uneven nucleotide frequency than PRD1 (Fig. 10). Bam35c seems to favor clustering of some of the bases, while PRD1 uses them more evenly. This might be partly related to differences in the G-C content between the genomes and to the fact that PRD1 genome is, due to its broad host-range, devoid of the palindromic sequences for most restriction enzymes recognizing six bases (Bamford et al., 1991). Although the nucleotide usage differs, there seems to be an equal change of the G-C content in both viruses along the sequence (Fig. 10). However, similarities in nucleotide composition can be seen between some of the Bam35c and PRD1 genes (Fig. 10). For example, the overlapping Bam35c ORFs 10 and 11 form a pattern similar to the overlapping PRD1 genes VI and X (coding for proteins P6 and P10, respectively) (Bamford et al., 1991). Comparison of the corresponding amino acid sequences also revealed common features. PRD1 P6 is a minor capsid protein with a role in DNA packaging (Stromsten et al., 2003). The ¨ sequence contains 17.4% glutamic acid residues and the protein is highly negatively charged (charge 25.1 at pH 7). The product of Bam35c ORF10 has 27.6% glutamic acid (and 15.8% of lysine) residues with the overall calculated charge being 17.1. PRD1 P10 is a membrane-bound scaffolding protein (Mindich et al., 1982a,b; Rydman et al.,

2001) with a pattern of glycine and serine (and sometimes arginine) residues grouped together at the amino-terminus of the protein. Likewise, the gene product of Bam35c ORF11 has a similar type of pattern in the amino-terminus, although the sequence alignment similarity score was very weak (data not shown). The need for certain types of amino acids to fulfill structural and functional requirements might conserve the nucleotide composition of Bam35c and PRD1 genes. The codons for glutamic acid and lysine residues are composed only of A or G nucleotides, which might result in the lower abundance on average than T and C nucleotides in ORFs 10 and 11, and in genes VI and X, respectively (Fig. 10). It is likely that these two gene pairs are functional counterparts. Discussion The motivation to more efficiently delineate the proposed lineage of viruses represented by PRD1, adenovi-

ruses, and PBCV-1 led us ask whether gram-positive bacteria harbor viruses possibly belonging to this lineage. Adenovirus and PBCV-1 infect animal and algal hosts, respectively, which were separated less than a billion years ago (Carrol, 2001). On the other hand, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are considered to be separated more than a billion years ago. This results in a near uniform sampling of the evolutionary space in both bacterial and eukaryotic domains. Obviously, if all these viruses belong to the same lineage, they must have had a common ancestor that existed before the bacterial and eukaryotic domains were separated. It appeared that there was only one available rational candidate, Bam35, to be studied in more detail. The most troublesome feature of this virus system is that the virions are fragile and decay rapidly, even when cultured in LB. The virions are also very sensitive to high salt concentrations, excluding the use of CsCl equilibrium centrifugation. When the growth and rate zonal purification was carried out during a single day, specific infectivity of about

1.6 1012 PFU/mg was achieved (Table 1). When the protein composition of this virus material was examined, almost half of the protein mass was due to contaminating flagella (Fig. 4A) with only minor amounts of other impurities. Taking this into account, the deduced specific activity of this virus material was about twice the calculated value. Even this number is less than half of the corresponding value (1 1013 PFU/mg protein) (Walin et al., 1994) determined for PRD1. Any further purification step led to lower specific infectivity values despite increased purity. This is a reflection of the sensitivity of the Bam35c virion and limits its usage to very fresh material. Fortunately,

frozen ( 80°C) LB virus stocks retained sufficiently high titers for prolonged storage (3 months tested). The stability of PRD1 virions, which is much higher than Bam35c, may reflect their ability to infect enterobacterial hosts and survive in intestinal environments. The negative-stain electron microscopic data of Bam35c (see also Ackerman et al., 1978) show features in common with PRD1. The similarities were extended when the virion protein patterns and genome lengths were compared. The length of the Bam35c genome is almost exactly the same as that observed for PRD1. Further, the capsid sizes are practically identical and Bam35c contains an internal membrane

Table 3 Matching of Bam35c gene products and PRD1 proteins and gene products (see text for details)

1) Putative gene products of Bam35c are numbered by arabic numerals according to the corresponding ORFs. For the PRD1 protein nomenclature see Bamford et al., 1991 and Bamford et al., 2002b. 2) The initial methionine is included. 3) Isoelectric point. 4) Number of predicted transmembrane helices.

similar to PRD1, making the available volume for DNA packaging equal to that of PRD1. PRD1 DNA density inside the particle is high, close to crystalline DNA (Tuma et al., 1996). We have proposed that the energy created during PRD1 DNA packaging is used to drive the initial stages of DNA delivery into the host cell (Grahn et al., 2002b). The similarities in genome length and capsid volume highlight the importance of DNA packaging density and point to a similar DNA delivery mechanism. In addition, both viruses have covalently linked terminal proteins in their genomes. 3D-PSSM, PSI Blast, and alignment analyses could directly link only four putative Bam35c proteins (of 32) to PRD1 proteins. However, by combining the computational analysis and biological and biophysical data available for the PRD1 system, we were able to extend the comparison (Table 3). It is obvious that the genome organization of Bam35c follows that of PRD1. The early functions in PRD1

are located at the termini of the genome. It is possible that the Bam35c counterparts for the two early DNA-binding protein genes (XII and XIX) at the 3 end of the PRD1 genome have moved to the 5 end in the Bam35c genome (ORFs 2 and 3; Fig. 9). The putative DNA polymerase gene (ORF 5) of Bam35c is preceded by ORF 4 that could be a candidate for the genome terminal protein according to the gene order in PRD1 (Fig. 9; Table 3, dashed line). In PRD1, the genes for the vertex complex proteins are transcribed from separate operons. The penton and the spike protein genes (XXXI and V, respectively) are located in the same operon (in this order), and the gene (II) for the receptor-binding protein is transcribed from a different operon (Grahn et al., 1994). There does not seem to be a clear counterpart for the receptor-binding protein in Bam35c. This is not surprising, since the host is a gram-positive bacterium with a different cell surface than the host for

411

PRD1. In Bam35c, the putative operon for the vertex complex proteins (ORFs 27 and 28) is located after the operon for the coat and membrane-associated proteins. This differs from the location of the corresponding operon (OL1) in PRD1 (Table 3). In PRD1, the region coding for the proteins involved in virus assembly and DNA packaging likely has a counterpart in Bam35c. Bam35c, however, has more ORFs in that position than PRD1. It was shown by nucleotide frequence comparison that ORFs 10 and 11 correspond to genes VI and X (see Results). ORF 6 had similarity to the LexA-type of transcriptional proteins not observed in PRD1. The GC content of ORF 9 is the lowest among Bam35c ORFs (29.9%) and there is a noncoding DNA region (maybe a possible promoter) upstream of the ORF, suggesting that it might have been acquired recently as a so-called "moron" (Hendrix et al., 2000). It also is possible that the counterpart of Bam35c ORF 17 upstream of the coat protein ORF18 is absent in PRD1. There are three ORFs upstream of the coat protein gene in Bam35c, whereas there are only two ORFs in PRD1 (Fig. 9). In PRD1, gene XX codes for a small membrane protein involved in DNA packaging and the function of ORF i is unknown. It can be postulated that ORF i arose as a result of gene duplication from gene XX since both genes code for 42-residues-long peptide and the sequences are conserved. Remarkably, ORFs 15 and 16, which have corresponding positions in the Bam35c genome, code for 46-residues-long proteins. Both have a single predicted transmembrane helix and equivalent isoelectric points (10.63 and 10.24, respectively; Table 3). However, the overall similarity (34.8%) is not very high. The possible relationship between Bam35c gp16 and PRD1 P20 is marked with a dashed line in Table 3. Sequencing of the amino-termini of the proteins correlating to the genes for structural proteins of Bam35c revealed the corresponding genes grouped together in the right half of the genome. This region corresponds to operon OL3 in PRD1, which codes for the coat protein P3 and other structural proteins (Bamford et al., 1991; Grahn et al., 1994). The counterparts for the genes of the coat protein P3, the membrane protein P11, and the transglycosylase P7 of PRD1 were established. It is tempting to suggest that the counterpart to the small DNA packaging protein gene (XXII in PRD1) downstream of the coat protein gene is ORF19 in Bam35c based on its genome location and as its demonstration as a structural protein (dashed line in Table 3). The fact that the Bam35c DNA polymerase, coat protein, and proteins needed for the assembly and DNA packaging of the virus particle have the most easily recognizable counterparts in PRD1 is in agreement with the evolutionary conservation hypothesis suggested previously (Benson et al., 1999; Bamford, 2003; Bamford et al., 2002a). According to that hypothesis, the conserved viral structures and functions form an innate viral self that has evolved early and changes slowly. It is obvious that horizontal gene flow exists. However, vital viral functions such as capsid assem-

bly cannot be compromised without going extinct. For this reason such elements as coat protein fold and interactions are very preserved. Only very conserved changes are allowed to retain viability. As a consequence these structures stay conserved, although sequences may diverge beyond recognition with current methods. In contrast, the structures and functions involved in the interactions with the host cell evolve rapidly to assure continued parasitism in a changing host. The above observations and, in particular, the discovery that the Bam35c coat protein topology most probably is very similar to that of PRD1, strongly suggest that Bam35c and PRD1 are related. Without data from other viruses (adenovirus and PBCV-1) infecting eukaryotic hosts having many common features with PRD1 (and Bam35c) the most logical conclusion would be that the PRD1­Bam35c relationship is due to lateral gene transfer. However, it is very difficult to posit that a virus system could successfully jump from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. It also has been argued (Hendrix, 2002; Bamford et al., 2002a) that the probability of viruses having so many similar features evolved independently is very low. Our conclusion is that Bam35c is yet another member in the virus lineage originally proposed based on PRD1 and adenovirus comparisons (Benson et al., 1999). It would be interesting to determine if there are additional viruses to be identified with similar structural and functional features infecting archaeal hosts, giving additional support for the presence of a virus lineage that extends to hosts in all domains of cellular life.

Materials and methods Bacteria and phages Wild-type Bam35 and its host B. thuringiensis HER1410 were obtained from the Felix d'Herelle Reference Center for Bacterial Viruses, Laval University, Quebec, Canada. Cells were grown in Luria­Bertani medium (Sambrook and Russel, 2001). Several rare Bam35 clear plaques were picked and pure lines were obtained through three consecutive single plaque purification steps. The wt, producing turpid plaques, and the clear plaque variant were used to make virus stocks by collecting the soft agar (using 3 ml of LB per plate) from semiconfluent plates. The agar cultures were incubated for 2 h at 28°C with aeration; cell debris was removed by centrifugation (Sorvall SLA rotor, 10,000 rpm, 15 min, 5°C). The titer of the supernatant was determined on HER1410 (plates grown overnight at 28°C). Due to the thermosensitivity of the phage and the host, the soft agar was cooled to 48°C before addition to the host­virus mixture. The virus stocks were stored at 4°C or frozen at 80°C in the presence or absence of 20% glycerol. In the latter conditions about 90% of the infectivity was retained after storage with no fast decay. Bacteriophage PRD1 was grown on flagella-less Salmo-

nella enterica DS88 (Bamford and Bamford, 1990). PRD1 particles were purified by rate-zonal centrifugation in sucrose gradients (Bamford and Bamford, 1991) followed by ion-exchange chromatography using Sartorius D100 cartridges (Sartorius) essentially as described by Walin et al. (1994). Growth and purification of Bam35c Growth of the phage in liquid LB medium (at 37°C) was carried out by infecting aerated cultures of B. thuringiensis HER1410 at a cell density of 2 108 CFU/ml using an m.o.i. of about 15. The cultures were incubated at 37°C until lysis occurred. The lysates were cleared by low-speed centrifugation (Sorvall SLA3000 rotor, 8000 rpm, 30 min, 5°C) and virus particles in the supernatant were precipitated by adding solid polyethylene glycol 6000 and NaCl (final concentrations 5% and 0.5 M, respectively) followed by magnetic stirring for 30 min at 4°C. Phage precipitates were collected by low-speed centrifugation (Sorvall SLA3000 rotor, 8000 rpm, 10 min, 5°C) and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.2 (about 10 ml/L lysate) for at least 2 h on ice with gentle shaking. For rate zonal separation the resuspended pellet was loaded onto linear 5­20% (w/v) sucrose gradients (in 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.2) and centrifuged (Sorvall AH629 or Beckman SW41 rotors, 24,000 rpm, for 1 h 10 min at 15°C). The gradients were fractionated or the light-scattering virus zones were collected and virus particles were recovered by differential centrifugation (Sorvall T647.5, 32,000 rpm, 2 h 30 min, 5°C or Sorvall T865, 40,000 rpm, 40 min, 5°C). The pellets were dissolved in 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.2 (about 0.8 ml/L lysate) overnight on ice (1 purified virus). The contaminating host flagella were precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate (final concentration 0.3 M using 2.5 M stock solution) to the 1 purified virus preparation containing about 4 mg/ml of protein. After a 5-min incubation on ice the suspension was centrifuged twice (microcentrifuge 13,000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C) to remove the precipitate. The resulting supernatant was designated as flagella-free 1 purified virus. This virus material was layered onto linear 20 ­70% (w/v) sucrose gradients made in 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.2 and the virus particles were centrifuged to equilibrium (Beckman SW41 rotor, 24,000 rpm, 20 h, 15°C). The gradients were fractionated (BioComp fraction collector) or the light-scattering virus zones were collected, diluted 1:1 with the buffer, and pelleted as in the case of rate zonal purified virus. The pellet was rinsed with buffer and resuspended in 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.2 (about 0.1­ 0.2 ml/L lysate) on ice overnight. For equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl, 1 purified virus material was loaded onto the top of 2.4 M CsCl solution (in 10 mM phosphate pH 7.2) in Beckman SW41 tubes and centrifuged (22,000 rpm, 22 h, 20°C). The gradients were fractionated using BioComp fraction collector. For purifi-

cation using an iodixanol (OptiPrep) gradient, 1 purified virus material was layered onto linear 5­ 40% (w/w) gradients and centrifuged to equilibrium (Beckman SW41 rotor, 35,000 rpm, 4 h, 10°C), and the light-scattering virus zones were collected (BioComp fraction collector). Electron microscopy For thin-section electron microscopy B. thuringiensis HER1410 cells were grown at 37°C to a density of 2 108 CFU/ml and infected with a freshly made stock of Bam35c using an m.o.i. of 17. Samples were taken at 10, 30, 40, and 45 min postinfection and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde. After 20 min fixation at room temperature, cells were collected, washed twice with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and prepared for transmission electron microscopy as previously described (Bamford and Mindich, 1980). For negative staining, the 1 purified virus specimens on carbon-coated grids were stained with 1% (w/v) potassium phosphotungstate (pH 6.5). The micrographs were taken with a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope (at the EM unit, Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki) operating at 60 kV. Analytical methods The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford (1976) assay using BSA as a standard, and the protein composition was determined by SDS­PAGE (Olkkonen and Bamford, 1989). N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined from protein bands that had been separated by SDS­PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, and subjected to Edman degradation using a Procise 494A protein sequencer (Perkin­Elmer/Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the Protein Chemistry Laboratory, Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki. Determination of the Bam35c genome sequence Bam35c genomic DNA was extracted from the purified virus particles essentially as described for purification of PRD1 genomic DNA (Bamford and Bamford, 1991). The genome was digested with DdeI or RsaI restriction enzymes, end-filled with Klenow polymerase, and ligated into a SmaI-digested pSU18 vector. The sequence at the ends of the inserts in the resulting clones (pJB400-pJB403 and pJB411) was determined using universal and reverse sequencing primers (Sequencing Laboratory, Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki). The rest of the genome sequence was analyzed by a primer-walking technique using 75 specific primers and the viral genome as template. Both strands were sequenced. Sequence information was collected to obtain 3.5 times coverage.

Computational analyses Programs from EMBOSS package (Rice et al., 2000) were used with locally made shell-scripts to calculate several of the results. The GC-percentage and length were calculated using the program "infoseq." Inverted DNA repeats were identified using the "einverted" program. Local and global alignments were calculated with the programs "water" and "needle", respectively. The predicted genes were translated from ORFs to proteins with "transeq." Statistics for each ORF were calculated with the program "pepstats" and "freak." Several web-based services were used to further characterize the Bam35c genome. The putative ORFs were found using GeneMark.hmm- and GeneMark -programs (Lukashin and Borodovsky, 1998; http://opal.biology.gatech.edu/ GeneMark/). Several different Markov models were used to ensure that all reasonable ORFs were found. Possible homologies to known proteins were searched with PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). PSI-BLAST was executed for each ORF until no new hits were reported. Prediction of transmembrane helices was done using TMHMM program (Krogh et al., 2001; http:// www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Protein fold recognition was done using the 3D-PSSM method (Kelley et al., 2000; http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/ 3dpssm/).
