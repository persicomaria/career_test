Introduction. Peptide deformylases (PDF, EC 3.5.1.88) are metalloproteases (Fe2 ) that cleave the N-terminal formyl groups from newly synthesized proteins, therefore important in protein processing.1 Since the PDF activity is reported to be essential for bacterial survival,2 and PDF homologs in animal and human are not functional on deformylation,3 PDF has been considered as a potential target in antimicrobial chemotherapy. There have been a number of inhibitors reported targeting PDF4,5 including the ones mimic actinonin,6 a naturally occurring hydroxamic acid pseudo-peptide that is known to be highly potent (Ki 0.28 nM for E. coli PDF). Based on amino acid sequence similarity, PDFs have been classified into two subfamilies,7 type I being represented by the Escherichia coli enzyme and the type II by Staphylococcus aureus enzyme. Both biochemical and structural studies show that the two types share close enzymatic properties and overall structures in spite of rather low sequence homology.8 ­13 Many bacteria possess only one gene coding PDF, but some are found with two, three or even four active PDF gene sequences.7 For example, recently reported genome of endospore-forming bacteria Bacillus cereus,14 an opportunistic pathogen causing food poisoning, diarrhea and emetic symptoms,15 and Bacillus anthracis,16 the causative agent of inhalational anthrax,17 show that they possess two def genes encoding PDF as in Bacillus subtilis.18 The two PDF proteins in B. cereus and B. anthracis as well as B. subtilis share about 30% amino acid sequence identities and one is about 25 residues longer than the other. In case of B. subtilis the longer PDF, that is, YkrB, is reported to be more active.18 The structure of PDF from B. Stearothermophilus is reported to be of type II.7 Here we report the crystal structures of the short PDF from B. cereus in both inhibitor free (denoted as BcPDF) and actinonin bound (denoted as BcPDF/Actinonin) forms. Materials and Methods. Overexpression of BcPDF (Swiss Prot. code: Q819U0), its crystallization, and X-ray data collection has been reported elsewhere.19

Both the inhibitor free and the actinonin bound crystals belong to an orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit-cell dimensions of a 42.80 Å, b 44.33 Å, c 84.81 Å, and a 41.31 Å, b 44.56 Å, c 84.47 Å, respectively. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of PDF, giving a crystal volume per protein mass (Vm) of 2.29 Å3 Da 1 and a solvent content of 46%. The crystal structure of BcPDF was determined by molecular replacement techniques using the crystal structure of PDF from Thermotoga maritima10 (TmPDF) (PDB entry code, 1LME), since BcPDF shares the highest sequence identity (42%) with TmPDF among the known structures. The initial trial using the entire TmPDF model failed, but the model (residues 1­140 of TmPDF) without the C-terminal tail gave a good solution. The refined model comprises 151 residues (out of 156 residues), 117 water molecules and one metal ion (Ni2 ) in the asymmetric unit. The metal ion assessment was carried out using X-ray fluorescence experiment at Pohang Light Source and the characteristic signal near the kappa edge for nickel was detected. The C-terminal five residues could not be placed without ambiguity and left out in the final model. The final crystallographic R- and Rfree- values are 19.9 and 22.3% for all 17,800 reflections between 50.0 and 1.7 Å resolution. The crystal structure of BcPDF/Actinonin was readily solved using the refined BcPDF structure. The final Rand Rfree- values for the actinonin bound structure were 18.4% and 23.7%, respectively, for the reflection in 50.0 ­2.0 Å resolution range. The crystallographic refinement was performed with CNS20 and model building was carried out with the program O.21 All non-glycine

residues are located within the allowed regions in Ramachandran plot in both structures. Crystallographic refinement statistics for the final models are shown in Table I. The final coordinates and structure factors for both BcPDF and BcPDF/Actinonin have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession codes 1WS0 and 1WS1, respectively. Results and Discussion. The tertiary structure of BcPDF consists of a mixed topology, with two helices, three 310 helices and six strands [Fig. 1 (A)]. The geometry at the active site is well conserved, that is the metal ion (Ni2 in this case, replacing Fe2 ) is coordinated tetrahedrally by the three conserved residues, Cys90, His132, His136 and a water molecule for the inhibitor free structure and this is similar to what have been reported in other structures.7 The overall structure of BcPDF is quite similar to that of TmPDF with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 0.7 Å for 140 C atoms. Also as the sequence analysis indicated that the BcPDF is similar to the structures of type I PDFs than the type II PDFs. For example, it has an RMSD of 0.9 Å for 139 C atoms of EcPDF (sequence identity of 38%) while the RMSD for S. aureusPDF (31% identity) is 1.1 Å for 127 C atoms. However, the C-terminal of BcPDF does not belong to either type I or type II. In fact the C-terminal structures are distinct between the two types, that is, type I has a long -helix at the C-terminal while the type II C-terminal forms a -structure. The two termini point

the opposite direction. Despite the fact that BcPDF belongs to the type I class, the C-terminal end does not form an -helix. Instead it forms a short strand ( 6) that is antiparallel to 3-strand. This is somewhat similar to the C-terminal of Leptospira interrogans PDF13 (LiPDF), which shares about 34% sequence identity with an RMSD of 1.1 Å for 134 C atoms. Nonetheless, LiPDF has much longer C-terminal that forms a two-turn helix in addition. The TmPDF is another exception--it has even shorter C-terminal than BcPDF. The C-terminus of PDF has been suggested to play a role in anchoring the enzyme to the ribonucleoprotein complex in order to be in the proximity of the substrate.22 Yet the C-terminus appears to be highly variable in its structure as well as in its sequence. Another region that is highly variable is the CD loop indicated by a circle in [Fig 1(B)]. It varies not only in its length but also in its conformation--in some this loop is disordered, and it is found in two different ("open" and "closed") in LiPDF. In BcPDF it corresponds to the residues from Asp62 to Gly68, and is clearly defined in the electron density. Again, it is different from either type I or type II [Fig 1(B)]. In fact, it is a hybrid of type I and type II and it is almost tempting to classify it as type III. The overall structure of BcPDF/Actinonin structure is similar to that of BcPDF, and the RMSD value between BcPDF and BcPDF/Actinonin is 0.30 Å for 151 C atoms. However, the active site metal ion is penta-coordinated by Cys90, His132, His136, and the hydroxamate group of actinonin as shown [Fig. 1(C)]. Actinonin acts as a bidentate ligand providing both oxygen atoms of the hydroxamate moiety replacing the water molecule in the inhibitor free BcPDF structure. The binding pocket for actinonin (and substrate) is made from the helices 3, 4 and the strands 1, 3, and 4. The H-bond interaction residues for actinonin are Val45, Gln51, Gly89, Leu91, Glu133, and His136, which are all conserved in PDFs except the Val45. Although there is very little change in the structure upon actinonin binding, the strands 1, 3, and 4 forming substrate-binding pocket are slightly moved outward to make a somewhat larger (0.3­ 0.5 Å C atoms shift) pocket to accommodate the inhibitor. These differences are similar to what has been reported in other PDF-actinonin complex structures.
