Vinyl chloride reacts with cellular DNA producing 3,N4-etheno-2-deoxycytidine ( C) along with other exocyclic adducts. The solution structure of an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing an C,dG base pair was determined by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. NMR data indicated that the duplex adopts a right-handed helical structure having all residues in anti orientation around the glycosylic torsion angle. The C adduct has a sugar pucker in the C3endo/C4-exo region while the rest of the residues are in the C2-endo/C3-exo range. NOE interactions established Watson-Crick alignments for canonical base pairs of the duplex. The imino proton of the lesion-containing base pair resonated as a sharp signal that was resistant to water exchange, suggesting hydrogen bonding. Restrained molecular dynamics simulations generated three-dimensional models in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic data. The refined structures are slightly bent at the lesion site without major perturbations of the sugar-phosphate backbone. The adduct is displaced and shifted toward the major groove of the helix while its partner on the complementary strand remains stacked. The C(anti),dG(anti) base pair alignment is sheared and stabilized by the formation of hydrogen bonds. The biological implications of structures of C-containing DNA duplexes are discussed.
ABSTRACT:

Vinyl chloride, used in the production of synthetic polymers, vinyl carbamate, and ethyl carbamate, a component of certain foods and alcoholic beverages, induce hepatic carcinomas in rodents (Singer & Grumberger, 1983) and humans (Purchase et al., 1987). These compounds are oxidized by the hepatic P450 enzyme system to the reactive metabolites, chloroacetaldehyde, and epoxyethyl carbamate (Guengerich et al., 1979; Barbin et al., 1985; Scherer et al., 1968), and, as bifunctional alkylating agents, react with cellular DNA to produce 3,N4-etheno-2-deoxycytidine ( C),1 1,N2-etheno-2-deoxyguanosine (1,N2- G), 3,N2-etheno-2deoxyguanosine (3,N2- G), and 1,N6-etheno-2-deoxyadenosine ( A) (Barbin & Bartsch, 1986; Kusmierek & Singer, 1992). These exocyclic DNA adducts have been detected as endogenous lesions in human and rat liver DNA (Nath et al., 1994; Nair et al., 1995), contributing to the muatgenic burden of mammalian cells and, thereby, potentially to carcinogenesis.

lesions from DNA have been identified in human cells (Dosanjh et al., 1994; Saparbaev et al., 1995; Hang et al., 1996). The mutagenic properties of the C adduct have been investigated in bacteria using in Vitro and in ViVo systems. Replication of a DNA template containing C by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I leads to CfT transitions and CfA transversions (Singer & Spengler, 1986; Simha et al., 1991; Zhang et al., 1995a). Replication past the adduct by mammalian DNA polymerases R and  generates CfT transitions and CfA transversions while polymerase leads to CfG transversions (Shibutani et al., 1996). Transformation of Escherichia coli with vectors containing a single C adduct generates mostly CfT transitions and CfA transversions along with some deletion mutations. In bacteria, mutation frequency is low, indicating that the lesion is a weak mutagen (Palejwala et al., 1991, 1993; Basu et al., 1993; Moriya et al., 1994). In contrast, C is highly mutagenic in mammalian cells; CfA transversions and CfT transitions predominate (Moriya et al., 1994). Thus, it appears that during DNA replication C pairs productively with all four deoxynucleotides, depending on the polymerase involved. The solution structures of oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes containing exocyclic adducts have been investigated by NMR spectroscopy. Studies have been performed on the 1,N2propano-2-deoxyguanosine adduct positioned opposite dA and dG (Huang et al., 1993; Kouchakjdian et al., 1989; Kouchakjdian et al., 1990) or opposite a stable abasic site analog (Kouchakjdian et al., 1991b), and on the A lesion opposite T and dG (Kouchakjdian et al., 1991a; de los Santos et al., 1991). The adducts are readily incorporated into B-form DNA duplexes and stacked into the helix. Confor© 1997 American Chemical Society

Cullinan et al. three times before purification by HPLC. Oligodeoxynucleotide sequences were desalted by passing them through a Sephadex G-25 column and converted to the sodium salt using a Dowex 50W cation exchange column. Duplex Formation and Sample Preparation. A 1:1 stoichiometry of the duplex was obtained by monitoring intensity of NMR proton signals during gradual addition of the unmodified strand to the C-containing strand at 55 °C. NMR samples consisted of 400 OD260 of the duplex dissolved in 0.6 mL of 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, containing 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA in either 99.96% D2O or 90% H2O-10% D2O (v/v), corresponding to a concentration of approximately 5.5 mM. Samples were degassed under nitrogen before collection of the NMR data. NMR Experiments. One- and two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker (AMX) and Varian (Inova) spectrometers operating at 600 and 500 MHz, respectively. Proton chemical shifts were referenced relative to TSP at 0.0 ppm. Phase-sensitive (States et al., 1982) NOESY (50, 90, 150, 200, and 300 ms mixing times), COSY, DQFCOSY, and TOCSY spectra in D2O buffer were collected with a repetition delay of 1.5 s, during which the residual water signal was suppressed by saturation. A NOESY (150 ms mixing time) spectrum in H2O buffer was recorded using a jump-return reading pulse (Plateu & Gueron, 1982). Time domain data sets consisted of 2048 × 300 complex data points in the t2 and t1 dimensions, respectively. A COSY45 spectrum was recorded utilizing 4096 complex points × 1200 increments, resulting in a digital resolution of 1.2 Hz/point in the t2 dimension. A 15N-HMQC spectrum was recorded in H2O buffer applying jump-return pulse sequences to suppress the water signal (Bax et al., 1990) with 1024 complex points × 128 increments in the proton and nitrogen dimensions, respectively. NMR data were processed using Felix (Biosym Technologies, Inc.) running on Silicon Graphics computers. Time domain data sets were multiplied by shifted sinebell window functions prior to Fourier transformation. No base line correction was applied to the transformed spectra. Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were run on Silicon Graphics and Sun computers using X-PLOR 3.1 (Brunger, 1993). The structures were visualized with Midas Plus (UCSF, Computer Graphics Laboratory) and structural parameters obtained with Curves (Lavery & Sklenar, 1988; Lavery & Sklenar, 1989). Simulations were performed in Vacuo using an all-atom force field derived from CHARMM (Brooks et al., 1983). Partial atomic charges on phosphate groups were not reduced, resulting in deoxynucleotide residues with a net charge of -1. The value of the dielectric constant was set to 4 (Friedman & Honig, 1992). Cross-peak volumes measured from NOESY (50, 90, 150, 200, and 300 ms mixing times) spectra collected in D2O buffer were input into the program Mardigras (UCSF) to calculate interproton distances taking into consideration spin diffusion effects (Borgias & James, 1990). A single set of distance bounds was obtained by adding (0.8 Å to the averaged value determined by Mardigras and used during MD without any further readjustment. Experimental distance bounds were enforced using an empirical square-well energy potential functions with a force constant of 30 kcal/(mol Å2). Watson-Crick hydrogen bond alignments were enforced by distance restraint potentials on all canonical base pairs of the duplex. Backbone

mational changes are limited to the residues neighboring the lesion. Recently, we have reported the solution structure of 11mer oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes containing an C positioned opposite dA and T (Korobka et al., 1996; Cullinan et al., 1996). In both structures, the adduct is incorporated into a B-form DNA helix but is stabilized by different mechanisms. Positioned opposite dA, a staggered C(anti),dA(anti) alignment allowed partial intercalation within the base pair, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Positioned opposite T, C adopted a syn conformation around the glycosydic torsion angle, resulting in a C(syn),T(anti) alignment stabilized by hydrogen bonding. These structures are mutagenic intermediates during DNA synthesis. Although in mammalian cells, C-induced mutations are common, the most frequent outcome of DNA replication (Moriya et al., 1994) and feasible substrate of repair enzymes (Dosanjh et al., 1994; Saparbaev et al., 1995; Hang et al., 1996) is DNA containing the lesion positioned opposite dG. We describe here the solution structure of a d(C-G-T-A-CC-C-A-T-G-C),d(G-C-A-T-G-G-G-T-A-C-G) oligodeoxynucleotide duplex (referred to throughout this paper as the C,dG duplex), as determined by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics simulations. The chemical structure of 3,N4-etheno-2-deoxycytidine and the numbering scheme for the duplex sequence employed in this paper are shown in Figure 1. MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis and Purification of Oligodeoxynucleotide Duplexes. 3,N4-etheno-2-deoxycytidine was synthesized as a 5-dimethoxytrityl-3- -cyanoethylphosphoroamidite derivative (Zhang et al., 1995b) and incorporated into the oligodeoxynucleotide sequence by standard phosphoramidite chemistry procedures. Sequences containing an O-5dimethoxytrityl group were isolated by treatment of the crude synthesis product with concentrated ammonia for 46 h at room temperature and purified by reverse phase HPLC on a preparative Dynamax (300 × 25 mm) C4 column. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1 M triethylamine acetic acid buffer, pH 6.8) and solvent B (acetonitrile). Using a linear gradient of 0 to 50% of B over 50 min, the desired sequence eluted as a main fraction at 33 min. The O-5dimethoxytrityl group was cleaved by treatment with 80% acetic acid for 30 min and the solution extracted with ether

Asterisks indicate the cytosine H5-H6 cross peaks. X, unknown impurity.

dihedral angles were restrained by an empirical square-well potential function with a width encompassing a range for both A- and B-form DNA. Sugar puckers and glycosylic torsion angles were not restrained during the simulations. Six different initial models containing the C adduct were built by adding an etheno bridge to the N4- and N3-nitrogens of a deoxycytidine residue. Two of the initial models were canonical A- and B-form 11-mer duplexes having a coplanar alignment on the C6,G17 base pair. The other four models (two from B- and two from A-form DNA) were derived from 12-mer duplexes by deleting, in a staggered way, one residue from each strand at consecutive C,G base pairs located at the center. The resulting 11-mer structures were termed 3staggered or 5-staggered depending whether G17 was facing the 3- or 5-side of the lesion, respectively. To relieve steric clashes and optimize covalent geometry, the initial models were energy minimized by the conjugate gradient method prior to MD. Simulations consisted of an equilibration step during which the temperature was increased from 115 to 350 K in 10 ps, and the scale of the NOE distance restraint potential function was gradually augmented. Once the equilibration temperature was obtained, the simulation continued at 350 K for 5-8 ps, followed by cooling to 300 K in 2.5 ps, and 80 ps of restrained dynamics at constant temperature. For each initial model, seven structures were calculated using either a different set of initial velocities (three structures) or by cooling to 300 K at different times of the equilibration period (5-8 ps). Coordinates of the last 10 ps of the simulation were averaged and subjected to 2500 steps of energy minimization, yielding distance-refined structures. Covalent bond lengths of all hydrogens were kept constant during the simulations by using the SHAKE algorithm (Ryckaert et al., 1977). Distance-refined structures within each initial model were averaged and further optimized by 30 ps of MD at 300 K restrained by the full relaxation matrix method (Yip & Case, 1989; Nilges et al., 1991). During the first 3.5 ps, distance restraint potentials were gradually reduced to zero, and the scale of a potential function based on the intensity difference between experimental and back-calculated NOESY spectra was increased simultaneously. A total of 1440 experimental volumes measured from NOESY (50, 90, 150, 200, and 300

ms mixing times) spectra were input as restraints with a 30% error range. A grid search determined that an isotropic correlation time of 2.25 ns produced the closest initial fit to the experimental data, and this value was used during the refinement. Atom coordinates stored during the last 2 ps of the simulation were averaged and energy minimized yielding final NMR-refined structures. RESULTS Assignment of the Nonexchangeable Protons. The onedimensional proton spectrum of the C,dG duplex in D2O buffer, pH 6.9, 25 °C, is characterized by the presence of sharp signals and the absence of minor resonances (Figure 1S, Supporting Information). Assignment of the nonexchangeable base and H1 sugar protons followed the analysis of NOESY and COSY spectra using standard procedures (Hare et al., 1983; Wuthrich, 1986; van de Ven & Hilbers, ¨ 1988). Figure 2 shows duplicate contour plots of a NOESY (200 ms mixing time) spectrum recorded in D2O buffer, pH 6.9, 25 °C, depicting distance connectivities between the base (purine H8/pyrimidine H6) (6.9-8.4 ppm) and the sugar H1 (5.1-6.3 ppm) proton regions. Characteristic of a righthanded helix, each base proton exhibits NOE peaks to its own and 5-flanking H1 sugar protons, as shown from C1 to C11 in the C-containing strand (Figure 2A) and from G12 to G22 in the unmodified strand (Figure 2B). Also indicative of a right-handed helix, sequential NOE peaks are observed between A4(H2)-C5(H1), A8(H2)-T9(H1), A14(H2)-T15(H1), and A20(H2)-C21(H1) protons (peaks B and E, Figure 2A, and C and E, Figure 2B, respectively) and between G10(H8)-C11(H5), G12(H8)-C13(H5), and A20(H8)-C21(H5) protons (peaks G, Figure 2A, and F and G, Figure 2B, respectively). The sequential C(H1) to C7(H6) NOE cross-peak (Figure 2A, peak F) is very weak, suggesting a longer distance between these protons at the C6-C7 step of the duplex. The H5, H7, and H8 protons of C, as well as the H5 proton of C5, at the 5-side of the adduct, resonate outside the limits of Figure 2.

ms mixing time) spectrum collected on the same duplex sample at 15 °C is displayed in Figure 3. Seven strong NOE peaks, originated in the short (H5-H6) interproton distance (2.45 Å), account for all cytosine residues of the duplex. The C5(H5) signal, absent on the NOESY spectrum at 25 °C, is now observed near to the water at 4.62 ppm, while C(H5) proton has moved in the opposite direction and resonates in the base proton region (Figure 3, peaks C5* and C6*, respectively). A contour plot of an expanded region of a phase-sensitive COSY spectrum recorded in D2O buffer, pH 6.1, 13 °C displayed in Figure 2S (Supporting Information), confirm these assignments. C(H7) and C(H8) protons were identified by their strong distance interaction observed on all NOESY spectra (Figure 3, peak A). As it was previously observed (Korobka et al., 1996; Cullinan et al., 1996), these protons have a small J coupling constant and did not show a cross-peak between them in the phasesensitive COSY experiment recorded in D2O buffer at 13 °C (Figure 2S, Supporting Information) nor in the phasesensitive COSY45 spectrum recorded at 27 °C. C(H7) and C(H8) exhibited distance interactions to the flanking C5(H5) proton on the NOESY spectrum recorded in D2O buffer, pH 6.9, at 15 °C (Figure 3, peaks B and C). Assignment of the H2, H2, H3, and H4 sugar protons was based on NOESY (50 and 200 ms mixing time), COSY, DQF-COSY, and HOHAHA spectra following established procedures (Hare et al., 1983; Wuthrich, 1986; van de Ven ¨ & Hilbers, 1988). The chemical shifts of the nonexchangeable protons detected in D2O buffer, pH 6.9, 25 °C, are listed in Table 1. Assignment of the Exchangeable Protons: The imino and base/amino regions (5.8-14.0 ppm) of a one-dimensional proton spectrum recorded in H2O buffer, pH 6.9, 2 °C is shown in Figure 3S (Supporting Information). Nine partially resolved signals between 12.0 and 14.0 ppm and one sharp resonance at 9.7 ppm account for all the imino protons of the C,dG duplex. Assignment of the exchangeable protons

followed the analysis of a NOESY (150 ms mixing time) spectrum recorded in H2O buffer, pH 6.1, 2 °C. A contour plot of an expanded region showing distance connectivities between imino (12.2-13.9 ppm) and base/amino (5.1-8.7 ppm) protons is shown in Figure 4A. Upon duplex formation, deoxyadenosine H2 protons showed strong NOE interactions to the thymidine imino proton across A,T base pairs. The independent assignment of all deoxyadenosine H2 protons, from NOESY spectra recorded in D2O, allowed identification of this interaction on the T3,A20, T9,A14, T15,A8, and T19,A4 base pairs of the duplex (Figure 4A, peaks A-D, respectively). Deoxycytidine amino protons were specifically assigned following observation of their intraresidue connectivity to the H5 proton, detected on a NOESY (150 ms mixing time) spectrum recorded in H2O buffer, pH 6.1, 2 °C (peaks A-F, Figure 4S, Supporting Information). On formation of G,C base pairs, deoxyguanosine imino protons exhibited strong NOE peaks to both the hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded deoxycytidine amino protons across the G22,C1, G2,C21, G18,C5, G16,C7, G10,C13, and G12,C11 base pairs of the duplex (Figure 4A, peaks E, E; F, F; G, G; H, H; I, I, and J, J, respectively). Indicative of base pair stacking, deoxyadenosine H2 protons displayed distance interactions to imino protons of flanking base pairs at the G2,C21-T3,A20, T3,A20-T19,A4, T19,A4-G18,C5, G16,C7-T15,A8, and T9,A14-G10,C13 steps of the duplex (Figure 4A, peaks K-P, respectively). Further evidence of base pair stacking is obtained on the symmetrical imino proton region (12.2-13.9 ppm) of the same NOESY spectrum plotted in Figure 4B. Distance interactions are detected between G2(N1H)-T3(N3H), T19(N3H)-G18(N1H), G16(N1H)-T15(N3H), and T9(N3H)G10(N1H) imino protons of sequential base pairs of the duplex (Figure 4B, peaks A, B, E, and F, respectively).

The sharp resonance at 9.7 ppm was only observed with the sample dissolved in H2O buffer and, as a result, has to originate from an exchangeable proton of G17. In the NOESY (150 ms mixing time) spectrum recorded in H2O buffer, pH 6.1, 2 °C, this signal showed weak NOE peaks to the imino protons of G18 and G16 (Figure 4B, peaks C and D, respectively) and strong interactions to the C(H8) proton of the adduct, as well as an exchangeable proton resonating at 5.3 ppm, near the water signal (Figure 4A, peaks Q and R, respectively). Its assignment was established following the analysis a 15N-HMQC spectrum, recorded in H2O buffer, pH 6.1, 5 °C. Figure 5 shows an expanded region of the spectrum depicting correlations between imino proton (12.0-13.9 ppm) and imino nitrogen (139.1-168.5 ppm) regions. The 9.7 ppm signal interacts with a nitrogen at 142.0 ppm, within the imino nitrogen region of the spectrum, and far from the range observed for exocyclic amino nitrogens (70-100 ppm). Subsequently, it was

assigned to the G17(N1H) proton. Chemical shifts of the exchangeable protons and imino nitrogens are listed in Table 2. Temperature Dependence of the Imino Protons. The onedimensional spectra of the C,dG duplex displayed in Figure 6, depict the behavior of the imino protons on raising the temperature from 0 to 40 °C. At 0 °C, all imino protons, including G17 on the lesion containing base pair and terminal G12(N1H) and G22(N1H), are detected as sharp signals. On raising the temperature to 20 °C, the imino proton signals of terminal base pairs broaden as a consequence of an increase of the water exchange rate, but G17(N1H) is unaffected. At 30 °C, the imino proton signals of terminal base pairs have almost disappeared, while G17(N1H) and, to a lesser extent, G16(N1H) but not G18(N1H) signals started to broaden. At 40 °C, all imino proton signals are broad indicative of the melting temperature of the C,dG duplex. Sugar Coupling Constants. JH1-H2 and JH1-H2 coupling constants values were determined from the analysis of a phase-sensitive COSY45 spectrum recorded in D2O buffer, pH 6.9, 27 °C. An expanded region showing J interactions between the H1 (5.1-6.4 ppm) and H2, H2 (1.8-2.9 ppm) sugar proton regions is shown in Figure 5S (Supporting Information).

Cullinan et al. differences among minor groove protons at the lesion site are smaller and more scattered. In general, shielding is observed on the C,dG duplex for the H1 and H2 protons of C5, C, and C7 in the lesion-containing strand, while deshielding is detected on protons of the complementary strand (Figure 7B). Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Figure 6S (Supporting Information) shows an overlap view of the central five base pair segment of the distance-refined structures and Table 4S (Supporting Information) lists their RMSD. The structures obtained when MD was started from A- and B-form coplanar and A- and B-form derived 3-staggered initial models (28 total) converged to a structural motif with RMSD smaller than 0.9 Å from a mean structure (top structures, Figure 6S, Supporting Information). In these models, C is partially displaced toward the major groove of the helix and, to some extent, coplanar with G17, its partner on the opposite strand. A second structural motif, which differs with the previous by more than 2.7 Å in the RMSD of the atom positions, was obtained when the refinement started from A- and B-form derived 5-staggered models (Table 4S, Supporting Information). In this case, the refined structures are highly bent at the lesion site and have G17 positioned in the major groove and almost parallel to the helical axis (bottom structures, Figure 6S, Supporting Information). Despite the small RMSD among them (<0.6 Å with reference to their average), these structures are aberrant, being incompatible with the spectroscopic characteristics of the G17 imino proton and the chemical shift variations observed at the lesion site. Therefore, additional refinement was not performed. Mean structures, calculated from the distance-refined models in agreement with the NMR data (one for each group), were further optimized by 30 ps of MD retrained by the full relaxation matrix approach. Figure 8 shows an overlap view of the final NMR-refined structures and Table 3 list the violations from experimental data and idealized geometry. All four models reproduce the experimental NOE intensities with similar NMR R-factors (7.1-7.4%) without significant distortions of the covalent geometry (Table 3). The structures belong to the B-form DNA family, are slightly bent, and have a local perturbation of the sugar-phosphate backbone at the lesion site. With the exception of C,G17, all base pairs of the duplex are properly stacked in the helix. C and terminal C11 residues have C3-endo sugar puckers while all other sugars are in the C2-endo range. Figure 9 shows the middle of the duplex as viewed from the minor groove of the helix, and Figure 10 displays the same segment seen from the top. C is displaced into the major groove of the helix, and G17 has moved in the opposite direction, resulting in a base pair which is sheared by 4.0 Å and propeller twisted 25°. On the lesion-containing strand, residues are over- and undertwisted at C5- C6 and C6-C7 steps of the duplex, respectively, while values close to normal are observed on the partner strand. The adduct is shifted 2.7 Å and -2.2 Å at C5- C6 and C6-C7 steps, respectively, but again values close to normal are observed on the partner strand. Base pairs adjacent to the lesion are fully WatsonCrick hydrogen bonded and C5,G18 has 22° of base pair buckle. A mean distance of 2.5 Å separates C(O2) and G17(N1H), indicating the formation of a hydrogen bond across the C,G17 base pair. In addition, G17(N2H1) and G17(N2H2) are within hydrogen bond distance of C7(O4) and G18(O4), respectively, suggesting the presence of

peaks establishes that, with the exception of C, JH1-H2 > JH1-H2 on all sugars of the duplex (Majumdar & Hosur, 1992). Although measured J values do not correspond to a unique sugar conformation, they establish major sugar populations on the C2-endo/C3-exo range (Rinkel & Altona, 1987). In the case of the adduct, its H1-H2 cross-peak is clearly skewed toward a different direction (Box A, Figure 5S, Supporting Information), indicating a JH1-H2 > JH1-H2. Thus, C has a major population with sugar conformations in the C3-endo/C4-exo range. JH1-H2 and JH1-H2 coupling constants values are listed in Table 1S, Supporting Information. Chemical Shifts. Assignment of the base and sugar protons on the C,dG duplex allowed us to identify large variations in the proton chemical shifts. These values may be compared with those recently reported for C,T and C,dA duplexes, whose sequences only differ in the residue positioned opposite the adduct, T and dA, respectively (Cullinan et al., 1996; Korobka et al., 1996). Figure 7 depicts chemical shift differences observed for the nonexchangeable base and sugar protons of the three central base pairs of the duplexes, and Tables 2S and 3S (Supporting Information) list differences for all the protons of the sequence. In general, small chemical shift differences are detected for protons on the outer base pairs of the duplex (Tables 2S and 3S, Supporting Information). Closer to the lesion, the major groove protons of C5 and, to a lesser extent, of G18 are shielded on the C,dG duplex. On the contrary, major groove protons of C and C7 have moved in the opposite direction, indicating that they are deshielded (Figure 7A). The same is true for the exocyclic H7 and H8 protons, which are deshielded by 0.79 and 1.22 ppm and by 0.20 and 0.81 ppm when compared to the C,dA and C,T duplexes, respectively (Tables 2S and 3S, Supporting Information). Chemical shift

and Table 5S (Supporting Information) compares experimental and refined distances on the central segment of the duplex. DISCUSSION NMR spectra. Nonexchangeable Protons. The NMR spectra recorded in D2O and H2O buffer are characterized by the presence of sharp peaks (Figure 6; Figures 1S and 3S, Supporting Information). Their subsequent assignment to only one set of proton resonances (Tables 1 and 2) supports the existence of a single averaged structure for the C,dG duplex in solution. The directionality of sequential distance interactions observed in the NOESY spectra between the base (purine H8/pyrimidine H6) and the sugar H1, H2, H2, H3, deoxycytidine H5, and thymine methyl protons clearly indicates that the C,dG duplex adopts a right handed helical structure (Hare et al., 1983; Wuthrich, 1986; van de ¨ Ven & Hilbers, 1988). Furthermore, the intensity of intraresidue NOE peaks between the base and H1 sugar protons (Figures 2 and 3) establish glycosylic torsion angles in anti conformation for all residues of the duplex. Unlike our previous experience (Korobka et al., 1996; Cullinan et al., 1996), all four base protons of the adduct, C(H5), C(H6), C(H7), and C(H8), resonate within 1.1 ppm in the base proton region of the spectrum, suggesting increased solvent exposure in the C,dG duplex. The stereospecific assignment of C(H7) and C(H8) protons was based on distance interactions observed in a NOESY spectrum recorded in H2O buffer and structural considerations. When the glycosylic torsion angle of the adduct is anti, its H8 proton is located toward the center of the helix

Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 39, 1997 11941 precision of the structure determination, we ran MD starting from very different DNA conformations and calculated several structures for each of the initial models. The RMSD in the atom positions along with the visual inspection of the refined structures established the existence of two different motifs determined by restrained MD (Figure 6S and Table 4S, Supporting Information). Calculations starting from the 5-staggered models (derived from A- and B-form DNA) converged to structures with RMSD <0.6 Å with respect to their mean, but incompatible with the NMR data. Specifically, experimental distances determined at the lesion site, chemical shifts variations, and alignment of the C,dG base pair are not explained by these structures. On the other hand, MD calculations starting from coplanar and 3-staggered initial models (derived from A- and B-form DNA) converged to distance refined structures having RMSD <0.9 Å, with respect to their average, and in excellent agreement with the experimental data (Figure 6S and Table 4S, Supporting Information). Further refinement of averaged structures by the full relaxation matrix approach decreased the NMR R-factors to 0.07 (Table 3) increasing the accuracy of the final NMR-refined models. Our discussion focuses on this structural motif. The C,dG duplex structure is a right-handed helix within the B-form family, with an average bend of 25° at the lesion site and no major perturbations of the sugar-phosphate backbone. The steric clashes produced at the lesioncontaining base pair are relieved by displacing C and G17 into the major and minor groove of the helix, respectively. In addition, on the C5- C6 step, the adduct is shifted toward the major groove and, on the following step, C7 is back into the helix. The complementary strand does not follow this trend, and residues are not shifted (Figures 9 and 10; Table 4). The net result is a sheared C(anti),G17(anti) alignment which retains stacking of G17 with the flanking residues and allows hydrogen bonding across the base pair. This is a novel structural motif for exocyclic adducts, differing from the staggered alignment observed for the C,dA duplex (Korobka et al., 1996) as well as the partially intercalated structure of the A adduct (Kouchakdjian et al., 1991a; Huang et al., 1993). The chemical shift differences observed between the exchangeable and nonexchangeable protons of the C,dG and C,dA duplexes (Korobka et al., 1996) are in full support of the structure. The downfield shift detected for C (H5, H6, H7, and H8) proton signals (Figure 7) reflects their increased exposure to water that results from the adduct displacement and shift present in the structure (Figures 8 and 10). In addition, the upfield shift of flanking major groove proton signals, namely C5(H5, H6, and H2) and C7(N4H1 and N4H2) (Figure 7A and Table 2S, Supporting Information), is the result of their shielding by C which is positioned in the major groove of the helix (Figure 10). All the refined models have a strong hydrogen bond between C7(O4) and G17(N2H2), as well as a weak one between C(O2) and G17(N1H) across the lesion-containing base pair. In addition, G17 can be stabilized further by the presence of a hydrogen bond between G17(N2H1) and G18(O4) (Figures 9 and 10; Table 4). Notably, this network of hydrogen bonds at the lesion site do not perturb flanking C5,G18 and C7,G16 base pairs, which retained WatsonCrick alignment. Hydrogen bonding at the lesion site is fully supported by the experimental data which showed the G17-

lesion. In addition, sequential distance connectivities observed between imino and A(H2) protons (Figure 4A, peaks K-P) and among the imino protons (Figure 4B, peaks A-F) indicates favorable base pair stacking throughout the C,dG duplex (Wuthrich, 1986). ¨ Alignment of the C,dG Base Pair. With C and G17 residues adopting an anti conformation around the glycosylic angle, a coplanar alignment across the base pair results in severe steric clashes that are relieved by adjustment of the local structure. The intensity of sequential NOE peaks established a long distance between C(H1) and C7(H6), while normal distances are observed for the C5- C6, G16G17 and G17-G18 steps of the duplex (Figure 2). This observation rules out a staggered C,G17 base pair alignment, which requires long distances between base and H1 protons on both strands of the duplex, as established for the C,dA duplex (Korobka et al., 1996). The G17(N1H) proton showed comparable NOE interactions with G16(N1H) and G18(N1H) (Figure 4B, peaks C and D), suggesting similar distances between imino protons on the G16-G17-G18 stretch of the duplex. Likewise, C(H8) proton displayed distance connectivity with G17(N1H) on the unmodified strand (peak Q, Figure 4A) and with C5(H5), C5(N4H), and C7(N4H) located at both sides of the lesion (peaks K, J, and J, Figure 4S, Supporting Information). In addition, the line width of G17(N1H) signal is similar to other imino protons of the duplex, implying equivalent rates of exchange with water. Indeed, G17(N1H) signal is noticeably broad only above 30 °C, when "melting" of the duplex has started (Figure 6). Hence, we conclude that the C,dG base pair is coplanar and G17(N1H) is hydrogen bonded. C,dG Duplex Structure. To extend the three-dimensional space explored by the computer simulation and evaluate the

Furthermore, this proton was remarkably resistant to water exchange having a rate comparable to G16(N1H) (Figure 6). Considering that proton exchange is only possible when the base pair is transiently opened and that C7,G16 is fully hydrogen bonded, similar water exchange rate strongly argues for additional hydrogen bonding at the lesion site and supports the existence in solution of the G17(N2H)-C7(O4) and G17(N2H)-G18(O4) hydrogen bonds. Interproton distances measured in the refined structure are within the NMR-determined distance bounds (Table 5S, Supporting Information), giving further support to the three dimensional model presented here. Biological Implications. DNA duplexes containing C form stable complexes in aqueous solution (Korobka et al., 1996; Cullinan et al., 1996; this paper); these structures provide clues to key structural intermediates in translesional synthesis. In E. coli, the mutagenic frequency of C is remarkably low (2%), indicating that C(anti),dG(anti) pairing is principally involved. Undoubtedly, the hydrogen bonds formed by the exchangeable protons of dG contribute to the stability of the lesion-containing base pair. The partially stacked C(anti),dA(anti) alignment and the C(syn),T(anti) base pair, the latter with a single hydrogen bond, permit translesional synthesis in mammalian and SOSinduced E. coli cells. The relative frequency of insertion of dNTPs opposite C (Fins) and the frequency of extension from the 3-terminus of the replication fork (Fext) have been determined in primer extension reactions catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of pol I (Zhang et al., 1995). dAMP and TMP are both more efficiently inserted and extended by pol I than dGMP. Possibly, the substrate-binding pocket of pol I cannot accommodate a displaced adduct required to form an C(anti),dG(anti) pair, as reported in this paper. Lesion structure is not the only factor determining mutagenic specificity; the proofreading function of DNA polymerase and the frequency with which dAMP and dTMP are inserted opposite the lesion and then extended from the 3-terminus may be involved in the selection process. These factors were studied in a mutant strain of E. coli in which DNA polymerase III lacks a proofreading function. Following SOS induction, there is a marked increase in base substitutions (dA and dT for C) compared with wild-type strains (Moriya et al., 1994). Thus, proofreading appears to play a role in the selection process. In the C,dA intermediate, it is noteworthy that stacking forces allows translesional synthesis. In contrast to results in E. coli, the mutagenic frequency of C in simian kidney cells is very high (35-83%). Thus, all three duplex structures serve as models for intermediates in translesional synthesis, underscoring the critical role played by cellular DNA polymerases in determining mutagenic events that takes place during replication in mammalian cells (Moriya et al., 1994; Shibutani et al., 1996). Similar conclusions apply to our studies of the exocyclic adduct, 1,N2-propano-2-deoxyguanosine (Moriya et al., 1994) and the oxidized base, 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine (Shibutani et al., 1991).
