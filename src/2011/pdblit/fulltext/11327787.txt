The influence of the constitutive metal ions on the equilibrium properties of dimeric Photobacterium leiognathi Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase has been studied for the wild-type and for two mutant protein forms bearing a negative charge in the amino acid clusters at the dimer association interface. Depletion of copper and zinc dissociates the two mutant proteins into monomers, which reassemble toward the dimeric state upon addition of stoichiometric amounts of zinc. Pressure-dependent dissociation is observed for the copper-depleted wild-type and mutated enzymes, as monitored by the fluorescence shift of a unique tryptophan residue located at the subunit association interface. The spectral shift occurs slowly, reaching a plateau after 15­ 20 minutes, and is fully reversible. The recovery of the original fluorescence properties, after decompression, is fast (less than four minutes), suggesting that the isolated subunit has a relatively stable structure, and excluding the presence of stable intermediates during the dimer­ monomer transition. The dimer dissociation process is still incomplete at 6.5 kbar for the copper-depleted wild-type and mutated enzymes, at variance with what is generally observed for oligomeric proteins that dissociate below 3 kbar. Measurement of the degree of dissociation, at two different protein concentrations, allows us to calculate the standard volume variation upon association, DV, and the dissociation constant Kd0, at atmospheric pressure, (25 ml/mol and 3 £ 1027 M, respectively). The holoprotein is fully dimeric even at 6.5 kbar, which allows us to evaluate a lower DG8 limit of 11.5 kcal/mol, corresponding to a dissociation constant Kd0 , 1029 M.

Introduction
The ability of proteins to assemble in highly specific intermolecular complexes is a property on which a large variety of biological processes are based. In this context, knowledge of the interactions promoting association at the protein/ protein interface regions is required to explain the molecular bases of specific recognition and of signal transmission among components of the

assembly. One of the most direct approaches to the study of macromolecular recognition is to investigate the association properties of a dimeric protein under perturbing conditions. A model system suitable for such a study is represented by dimeric Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn SOD; EC 1.15.1.1), an enzyme catalyzing the dismutation of the superoxide anion found in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells and in the periplasm of Gramnegative bacteria.1,2 In particular, prokaryotic Cu,Zn SODs have been found to exist in either monomeric or dimeric forms depending on the bacterial species from which they are isolated.2 In the case of the prokaryotic dimeric enzymes, a quaternary assembly based on an association interface entirely distinct from that present in the

1352 eukaryotic Cu,Zn SODs has been observed.3 ­ 5 The interaction of the two prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD subunits is based on a ring-shaped contact region, defined by the 4d and the 5e b-strands of each monomer Greek-key b-barrel. In Photobacterium leiognathi Cu,Zn SOD (PSOD) three residue clusters are crucial for stabilization of the dimeric assembly. The first, centered on the side-chains of Trp73 and Phe71 on one subunit, includes residues Asn230 , Tyr250 , Val280 , Pro960 , Val970 , and Leu980 , from the facing PSOD subunit (primed). The second, centered on Met40 and Phe86, contacts Met400 and Phe860 . The third is formed by Lys24, Tyr25 and Asp750 , which are engaged in a hydrogen bonded network and an intermolecular saltbridge. It has been shown recently that mutation of Trp73 into Tyr or Phe, within the first cluster, induces a metal-dependent subunit association.6 In fact, removal of both metals from the mutant enzymes induces monomerization that can be reverted upon addition of Zn(II), indicating a direct interaction between the active-site metals center and residue Trp73 at the subunit interface. Communication between the subunit association interface and the active site has been confirmed by analysis of the Val28 ! Gly mutation, in the same residue cluster, which gives rise to a PSOD mutant with increased catalytic rate, due to a modification of the dynamic properties of the enzyme activesite region.7,8 Moreover, a series of mutants affecting residues at the subunit interface showed altered copper affinity, when compared to the wild-type enzyme.9 Understanding of the molecular bases of communication between the metal centers and the subunit association interface is a key issue, since loss of Zn(II) from either wild-type or mutant human Cu,Zn SOD, associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been shown to induce apoptosis in cultured motor neurons.10 Moreover, structuraldynamic changes at the Cu,Zn SOD subunit interface, upon copper transfer from the copper chaperone CCS, is a fundamental step in the process of Cu,Zn SOD maturation.11 ­ 13 To investigate the role of the Cu,Zn pair in modulating PSOD quaternary structure, we present here a study of two PSOD mutants (Lys24 ! Asp, Met40 ! Glu) under different metal active-site occupation states (Cu-depleted, Cu,Zn-depleted, and Cu,Zn fully occupied active sites), in a comparative analysis with the wildtype protein. The enzymes have been examined through a combination of pressure perturbation, spectroscopic techniques and X-ray crystallography. The results indicate that the zinc ion has an all-or-none effect, the enzyme being monomeric or dimeric in its absence or presence, respectively. On the other hand, experiments carried out in the absence of copper, at different pressures, allow us to evaluate the monomer ­ dimer equilibrium and to calculate the metal contribution to dimer stability.

Results
Structural properties of the mutated PSODs The two mutant Met40 ! Glu, and Lys24 ! Asp PSODs, are characterized by the presence of a single negatively charged residue in two of the three clusters involved in the protein dimerization interface contacts.5 Despite such a perturbation, the two mutants, in their metal-bound form (i.e. when they contain one copper and one zinc atom for each subunit) are stable as dimers and do not show any tendency to dissociate into monomers, even at high dilutions. In line with this observation, both mutants display a catalytic rate comparable to that of the wild-type, when measured through the pyrogallol method, and an identical copper EPR spectrum, diagnostic of complete preservation of the active-site stereochemistry between the native and mutated enzymes (data not shown). The refined X-ray three-dimensional structures of the Lys24 ! Asp and Met40 ! Glu PSOD mutants confirm (see Table 1 and Figure 1) that the active-site Cu,Zn center geometry is unperturbed by the subunit interface mutations introduced, the copper coordination distances being comparable, within experimental error, with those found in the wild-type enzyme structure. In particular, the average Zn coordination bond length is ° 2.0 A, in good agreement with a tetra-coordinated Zn(II) ion complex, and with Zn coordination geometry observed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic Cu,Zn SODs.2,9 On the other hand, as observed in several crystal structures, X-ray-induced photoreduction is held responsible for inequivalence within the four Cu coordination bond lengths, ° which average at 1.99 A for the His44, His46 and ° His118 ligands, and at 2.99 A for the His61 (Cu ­ Zn bridging) residue. Such a discrepancy is indicative of partial reduction of the active-site Cu(II) to Cu(I), resulting in rupture of the Cu-His61 coordination bond.14 Concerning the overall protein structure, the subunit fold within each of the dimeric mutant enzymes matches closely the conventional eightstranded Greek key b-barrel observed in wildtype PSOD.4,5 Optimal superposition of subunit A from the two PSOD mutants over subunit A of the wild-type PSOD yields RMSD values lower than ° 0.2 A (calculated for 139 Ca atom pairs). Within each subunit, most of the (contained) structural variations observed occur in the proximity of the mutation sites and at the dimer association interface, not visibly extending to other regions within the subunit. It must be stressed that, in spite of the residue substitutions, a general conservation of the number and nature of subunit interface intermolecular contacts is observed. Such a conservation includes the cluster of ten trapped water molecules that have been identified as mediating subunit recognition in the wild-type dimeric enzyme, as well as in other prokaryotic Cu,Zn SODs.3 ­ 5,15 Nevertheless, the subunit interface

mutations engineered are reflected in both mutant PSODs by small quaternary structure rearrangements, which manifest in relative juxtaposition of the two subunits (essentially trans° lations # 1 A). In detail, the specific structural perturbations observed in the two mutants (see Figure 1) at the subunit interface are as follows.

Glu PSOD The side-chain conformation for residues Lys24, Leu85 and Pro96, located at the subunit interface, are affected by the Met40 ! Glu mutation. In particular, the substitution of Met40 with Glu, allows the establishment of new van der Waals interactions between Glu40 and Asn950 . Role of zinc on the quaternary structure Upon Zn and Cu depletion, both Lys24 ! Asp and Met40 ! Glu mutant PSODs turn monomeric as observed by gel-filtration chromatography and, upon addition of stoichiometric amounts of Zn(II), the dimeric state is recovered (data not shown). The reversible dimer dissociation process can be followed by fluorescence spectroscopy, taking advantage of the presence of a single tryptophan residue (Trp73) per subunit, located at the subunit interface. The metal-bound dimeric mutant PSODs are characterized by a fluorescence spectrum having an emission maximum centered at 330 nm, as observed in the wild-type enzyme, characteristic of an indole group partially screened from the solvent.16 Removal of both metals causes a shift of the emission maximum to 350 nm, indicative of complete solvation of Trp73, following dissociation of the dimeric species (Figure 2). Addition of stoichiometric amounts of Zn(II) induces reversible

enzyme association into dimers, and the emission maximum shifts back to 330 nm (Figure 2). Role of copper on the quaternary structure In the last decade, the application of hydrostatic pressure has become an increasingly widespread tool for analyzing the dissociation of oligomeric proteins as, in principle, the method affords the determination of very small dissociation constants and, consequently, of the thermodynamic parameters (DH8, DS8 and DV) that characterize highly stable quaternary aggregates.17,18 The pressuredependence of the dissociation free energy DG( p) is described by: DGðpÞ ¼ DG8 þ pDV where DG8 is the dissociation free energy at atmospheric pressure, p is the applied pressure above 1 atm (101325 Pa), and DV is the volume change of the reaction. DG8 and DV are estimated from the linear-dependence of DG on p. As explained above, solvent exposure of the interface Trp73 residue, in PSOD, affects the fluorescence spectrum, providing a quantitative measure of the degree of subunit dissociation. When both wild-type and mutant holo-PSODs (i.e. containing the Cu,Zn active-site pair) were tested for pressure-induced dissociation, pressures up to 6.5 kbar (1 bar ¼ 105 Pa) did not affect the Trp73 fluorescence spectrum, supporting the absence of dimer dissociation. The only effect of pressure on the holo proteins was a modest, 2 nm, red shift of

the spectrum, which, in all cases was independent of protein concentration and completely reversible, i.e. recovered immediately on decompression. Small spectral shifts induced by pressure are observed in monomeric proteins, and have been attributed to slight conformational changes/ enhanced hydration induced by compression.19 After the removal of the active-site Cu ion, however, compression induces a large shift of the fluorescence spectrum for wild-type and mutant PSODs alike. As an example, the fluorescence spectra of Cu-depleted wild-type PSOD, at atmospheric pressure and at 6.5 kbar, are shown in Figure 3. The observed spectral shift was attributed to subunit dissociation, as opposed to partial unfolding, since it exhibits the protein concentration-dependence expected for a monomer ­dimer equilibrium. As generally observed with dissociation of oligomers, the spectral shift proceeded slowly and a plateau was reached only after 15­ 20 minutes, at 20 8C. This was considered the minimum monomer ­dimer equilibration time; therefore, all measurements were conducted after 30 minutes of pressurization. The red shift, expressed in terms of the average emission energy (center of spectral P P mass np, (np ¼ niFi/ Fi), where Fi is the intensity at the frequency ni) measured in cm21, for the Cu-depleted wild-type PSOD, is plotted against pressure in Figure 4. The curve corresponds to a unimodal process that has not reached a plateau at 6.5 kbar, indicating that, at this pressure, dissociation is not complete. The spectral shift is fully

reversible and the recovery of the fluorescence properties after decompression is fast (less than four minutes). The prompt recovery on decompression and the lack of any hysteresis during the decompression part of the cycle (Figure 4) are consistent with a relatively stable structure for the isolated subunit.17 It should be mentioned that when PSOD dissociation was tested in the presence of guanidinium hydrochloride it was not possible to distinguish dissociation from subunit unfolding (our unpublished results). The degree of dissociation for Cu-depleted wildtype PSOD as a function of pressure, calculated from the relative change of the center of spectral mass np, is reported in Figure 5, for protein concentrations of 5 mM and 50 mM, respectively. The plot shows the concentration-dependence of the dissociation profile, the midpoint pressure of dissociation shifting to higher pressure at the higher concentration of protein in agreement with the dimer ­monomer equilibrium. It is remarkable that, while most oligomers tend to dissociate in the much lower, 1 ­3 kbar, pressure range,19 Cu-depleted PSOD dissociation is incomplete even at 6.5 kbar. This unusual resistance to pressure dissociation suggests that in the case of PSOD either the contraction volume is oddly small, or the subunit affinity is very high, or both. The standard volume change upon dimer dissociation (DV), and the dissociation constant at atmospheric pressure (Kd0), can be estimated from pressure-dissociation profiles using the following

Discussion
The results presented here hint at a direct communication between the subunit association interface and the active-site metal clusters, i.e. between ° two protein regions about 20 A apart in dimeric 5 PSOD. In detail, the zinc atom has been found to have a crucial role in the stabilization of the quaternary structure since, as shown by gelfiltration and fluorescence experiments, its presence is required to keep the Lys24 ! Asp and Met40 ! Glu mutants in a dimeric form. An identical behavior was found upon mutation of Trp73 to Phe or Tyr,6 showing that between the active site and the subunit interface communication is coded by a large part of the association interface, not being dependent on a single residue. The indication that the zinc atom has a crucial role in determining the assembly of bacterial Cu,Zn SOD has relevant implications, since it has been shown that loss of zinc from either wild-type or mutant human Cu,Zn SOD, associated to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, can induce apoptosis in cultured motor neurons.10 Inspection of the PSOD three-dimensional structures suggests the possible way through which zinc can trigger protein dimerization (Figure 1). In fact, all the four zinc ligands belong to the Zn-subloop, containing also the hydrophobic residues Phe71, Pro72, Trp73, which build up a large portion of the subunit interface. In absence of zinc the loop conformation may be altered, affecting the association interface properties through residues Phe71, Pro72 and Trp73. Conversely, zinc binding may induce rearrangement of the Zn-subloop providing the hydrophobic driving force required for dimer association. An important finding of the present investigation is the role of copper in conferring stability to the dimeric state of PSOD. Indeed, upon removal of copper the dimer was found to dissociate in the 0 ­6.5 kbar range, yielding a DG8 of about 8.5 kcal/mol (1 cal ¼ 4.184 J) and a DV of 20­ 25 ml/mol, in contrast with the Cu,Zn holoenzyme, which, is fully dimeric under the same conditions. Although pressure sensitivity to dissociation caused by copper removal could, in principle, result from either a decreased subunit affinity (DG8) or a larger volume change (DV), the main effect of the presence of copper in the active site appears to be that of tightening the interaction between subunits. A lower subunit affinity upon copper removal is consistent with the observation that in dilute, micromolar, samples a small degree of dissociation is observed for the Cu-free PSOD, even at atmospheric pressure. Next, we note that the dissociation volume change (DV), is small, compared to the range of 100­ 200 mL/mol typically found for dimeric proteins dissociation,22 and largely independent of either amino acid substitution at the subunit interface. It seems reasonable to assume the volume change to remain invariant (at 25 ml/mol) also in the holo protein, and

where Kd( p) is the dissociation constant at pressure p. Introducing ap, the degree of dissociation at pressure p, for the case of a dimer­ monomer equilibrium reaction, equation (1) takes the form: lnða2 =ð1 2 ap ÞÞ ¼ 2pðDVp =RTÞ þ lnðKd0 =4C0 Þ ð2Þ p where C0 is the molar protein concentration, expressed as dimer, and DVp is the volume change estimated from the pressure-dependence of the degree of dissociation.17,20 The inset of Figure 5 shows the plot of ln(a2/(1 2 ap)) versus pressure, p for 5 mM wild-type Cu-depleted PSOD. The dissociation volume change (DVp) derived from the slope is 2 23(^ 2) ml/mol and the dissociation constant at atmospheric pressure (Kd0), obtained from extrapolation to the ordinate axis, is 3.0 £ 1027 M. The volume change upon dissociation (DV) can be determined from the shift of the midpoint pressure (P1/2) on increasing the concentration of protein. For the monomer ­ dimer equilibrium, the difference in midpoint pressure (dP1/2) is related to the volume change, DVC (the volume change estimated from the concentration-dependence of the dissociation profile), and the protein concentrations C2 and C1 by the expression:17,20 dI1=2 ¼ RT=DVC lnC2 =C1 ð3Þ

The value of DVC obtained from the difference in P1/2 observed at 5 mM and 50 mM is 28(^ 3) ml/ mol, comparable, within the experimental error, to DVp calculated from equation (1). The agreement between DVp and DVC suggests that the dissociation process has a stochastic character,21 unlike the pressure dissociation of large protein aggregates.17,21 In spite of the change in composition of the subunit association interface region introduced by the mutations, both the extent of the fluorescence shift and the pressure dissociation profile are very similar for the Lys24 ! Asp and Met40 ! Glu Cu-depleted PSOD mutants. The thermodynamic parameters of mutant PSOD subunit dissociation are compared with those of the wild-type protein in Table 2. We note that both DV and Kd0 are not substantially modified by the mutations introduced.

estimate the minimum increase in dimer stability, DDG8, conferred by copper binding. For a degree of dissociation lower than 0.1, at 6.5 kbar, one obtains Kd , 1029 M, or DG8 . 11.5 kcal/mol for the native protein, indicating that binding of copper enhances by at least 3 kcal/mol the dimer stability. This free energy difference is equivalent to 1 ­ 2 strong hydrogen bonds, whose rupture could easily account for the weakening of the subunit affinity upon copper removal. A decreased dimer stability upon copper removal can be correlated with the process of protein maturation observed in eukaryotic Cu,Zn SOD, where a specific copper chaperone (CCS) is responsible for copper transfer to superoxide dismutase.23 CCS contains a domain with SODlike structure capable of recognizing monomeric SOD. Once bound to CCS, SOD receives a copper ion transferred from a specific Cys-X-Cys copper site.11,12 Copper insertion then induces conformational changes of the SOD association interface, domain, rendering it prone to recognize a second mature Cu,Zn SOD subunit and triggering its dissociation from CCS. Although up to now no CCS homologue has been identified in prokaryotes, the data presented here indicate that copper binding can modify the subunit association interface even in prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD, emphasising the existence of a communication mechanism between the active site and the dimer interface. A final comment concerns the small magnitude, as well as the constant value, of DV in the two PSOD mutants analyzed. It is known that large DV values usually arise from the presence of association interface cavities that are filled by water molecules upon oligomer dissociation.17 In PSOD, a large cavity is indeed present at the association interface but it is already filled with water molecules in the dimeric enzyme.5 It can then be expected that dissociation into monomers will produce only a minimal volume reduction. Along the same line, mutations decreasing volumes, such as Lys ! Asp or Met ! Glu, could, in principle, create empty spaces at the subunit interface (of 56 ml/mol and 19 ml/mol, respectively.24 Also, owing to water electrostriction around charged side-chains that become exposed to the solvent on dissociation, the introduction of a negatively charged residue at the subunit association interface, as for the Met40 ! Glu mutant, should contribute an additional DV of 20­ 50 ml/ mol per dimer.25 Nevertheless, the invariance of DV in the three PSOD forms considered suggests that the negatively charged Glu40 must be hydrated also in the dimeric state. In conclusion, the unusual resistance of PSOD to pressure dissociation is likely due to the small DV achievable upon separation of the two monomeric subunits, rather than to an exceptionally high subunit affinity. Such a property is related to the extensive, and uncommon, hydration of the subunit association interface in the assembled dimers, a struc-

tural feature minimizing the volume change expected upon dissociation.

Materials and Methods
Protein mutation and purification Single-site mutants Met40 ! Glu and Lys24 ! Asp of the recombinant Cu,Zn PSOD were prepared in a twostep PCR approach, according to Landt et al.26 The amplified DNA was restricted with Eco RI and HindIII, and subsequently cloned into vector pEMBL18, previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. The expression plasmid obtained was inserted into the Escherichia coli strain 71/18 as for wild-type PSOD. Recombinant clones were grown in standard LB medium containing ampicillin (70 mg/l) for five hours at 37 8C. Then 1 mM IPTG (Sigma) CuSO4 (to 0.25 mM) and ZnSO4 (to 80 mM) were added, and the cells were left to grow overnight. Periplasmic extracts were prepared as described,27 concentrated by ultrafiltration and loaded onto a gel-filtration FPLC column previously equilibrated with 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.0), 0.15 M NaCl, in order to separate monomeric and dimeric forms of the enzyme. Further purification of the two enzyme forms has been done by ion-exchange chromatography, as described.27 Proteins were purified to 98%, as judged by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method.28 The copper content of the protein samples was determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using a Cu2þ/EDTA solution as a standard. The activity assay was carried out with the pyrogallol method.29 Metal-free PSODs (devoid of both the copper and zinc ions) were produced by dialyzing the protein solution for 36 hours against 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.8), in the presence of 1 mM EDTA followed by a further dialysis against 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 3.8), 0.1 M NaCl to remove excess EDTA. Before reconstitution with zinc, metal-free proteins were dialyzed twice against 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5). Zinc reconstituted samples were dialyzed against 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and loaded onto a gel-filtration column equilibrated with the same buffer plus 50 mM EDTA. The zinc content in the copperfree and apo enzyme, evaluated by atomic absorption using a Perkin­ Elmer 3030 atomic absorption spectrometer equipped with a graphite furnace, was 2.32 ^ 0.2 and 0.18 ^ 0.2 zinc atom per molecule of enzyme, respectively. Crystal growth and crystallographic analyses of PSOD mutants Crystals of PSOD single-site mutants were grown under the physico-chemical conditions described for the wild-type enzyme,5 at pH 4.5 and 28 8C, from 20% PEG 8000, 0.1 M sodium chloride and 0.05 M sodium acetate solutions, with a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The Lys24 ! Asp and Met40 ! Glu PSOD mutants provided crystals isomorphous with those of the wild-type ° ° protein (space group R32, a ¼ b ¼ 86.9 A, c ¼ 99.0 A, g ¼ 1208, in the hexagonal setting, one PSOD chain per asymmetric unit). X-ray diffraction data were collected at the ESRF synchrotron radiation facility, Grenoble, France (beamline ID14-3 and ID14-2, respectively), at

100 K. The crystallisation mother liquor was modified to 30% PEG 8000, 0.1 M sodium chloride, 0.05 M sodium acetate, 10% glycerol, for cryo-protection at 100 K. The diffraction data of Lys24 ! Asp and Met40 ! Glu ° PSOD mutants were collected at resolutions of 1.73 A ° , respectively, and processed using DENZO30 and 1.50 A (see Table 1) and programs from the CCP4 suite. Refinement of the two PSOD mutant three-dimensional structures was achieved using the program REFMAC.31 Furthermore, REFMAC was used for anisotropic B-factor refinement in the last refinement stage for the Met40 ! Glu PSOD mutant. Inspection of models and maps throughout the refinement was based on the O package.32 The refined models display stereochemical parameters close to ideality33,34 (see Table 1). Luminescence measurements Fluorescence spectra intensities were obtained with a home-made apparatus.35 Briefly, continuous excitation for fluorescence spectra was provided by Cermax xenon lamp (LX 150 UV, ILC) and the excitation wavelength, typically 290 nm, was selected by a 0.22 m grating double monochromator (1680 Spectramate, Jobin-Yvon/ Spex) with a 5 nm bandpass. The emission collected through another 0.25 m grating monochromator (JobinYvon, H25) with 7 nm bandwidth was detected by an EMI9635QB photomultiplier. Luminescence measurements under pressure were carried out by placing the sample cuvette in a pressure cell (SITEC, Zurich) provided with sapphire windows and employing water as pressurising fluid. Particular care was taken to assure temperature equilibration of the sample after each pressure variation, which required at least five minutes. The degree of dissociation was determined from the displacement of the center of mass of the Trp fluorescence spectrum as described.36 Briefly, the centre of spectral mass n is defined by the equation: X X n ¼ ð ni Fi Þ=ð Fi Þ ð4Þ where Fi is the fluorescence emitted at the wavenumber ni. The degree of dissociation (ap) is related to n by the following expression: ap ¼ ½1 þ Qðnp 2 nM Þ=ðnD 2 np Þ21 ð5Þ

where Q is the ratio of the quantum yields of monomer and tetramer, np is the center of spectral mass at pressure p, and nM and nD are the corresponding quantities for monomer and dimer. The value of nD is calculated from the fluorescence spectrum at atmospheric pressure of the Cu-depleted SODs for concentrations of protein greater than 25 mM. At lower concentrations of protein the spectrum at atmospheric pressure is already shifted slightly, indicating a modest dissociation. The value used for nM was obtained from the fluorescence spectrum of Cu,Zn-depleted mutants that are monomeric at atmospheric pressure.
