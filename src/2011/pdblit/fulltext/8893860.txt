Gerko Hester and Christine Schubert Wright*
Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Medicinal Chemistry Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA, a 50 kDa tetramer) is a mannose-specific lectin of the Amaryllidaceae family of bulb lectins. Crystal structures of GNA complexed with methyl-a-D-mannose (MeMan) and mannose-a1,3-Dmannose-a-OMe (MeMan-2) have been determined and analyzed in terms of internal structural symmetry and saccharide binding. The final model of the 2.29 Å orthorhombic methyl-a-Man complex refined with an R-factor of 0.167 (all data) includes 12 bound sugar ligands and 327 water molecules. The four independent subunits (A, B, C and D) of the 222 tetramer and the three four-stranded b-sheets (I,II and III) that constitute each subunit compare closely (r.m.s.D = <1.0 Å). The 12 bound methyl-aMan molecules refined with B-factors <22 Å2 and occupancies in the range of 0.5 to 1.0. The highest occupied site is located in b-sheet I (site 1), where interactions from the dimer-related subunit contribute to complex stabilization. These subunit pairs (A-D and B-C) associate tightly with a buried surface area of 1738 Å2 and 33 interchain hydrogen bonds resulting from C-terminal strand exchange. In comparison, the A-B and C-D subunit pairs have narrow interfaces (476 Å2) and no direct H-bond contacts. The 3.0 Å structure of the cubic Man-a1,3-Man-OMe complex, determined by molecular replacement and refined with X-PLOR using NCS constraints and density modification methods, is less well ordered due to a high crystal solvent content (68%). Complexed disaccharide is responsible for the most crucial lattice contacts, which involve only one of the two independent subunits (A). The second subunit (C) shows a high degree of flexibility (Bav = 41.7 Å2). The complete disaccharide molecule is visible in both subunits at site 3, which is the only extended site. The ligand is oriented with its reducing end positioned in the specificity pocket. The non-reducing mannose is in contact through hydrogen bonding with a charged subsite (D37-K38) on the 2-fold-related subunit (A-B or C-D interfaces). Bound Man-a1,3-MeMan is also well defined in site 2 of subunit A, as a result of favorable lattice contacts, while only the mannose residue bound in the specificity pocket is visible at site 2 of subunit C and site 1 of both subunits. Together these results suggest that strong binding correlates with the presence of subsidiary contacts coming either from a dimer-related subunit or from lattice interactions. Site 1 is most specific for terminal non-reducing or reducing mannose, while site 3 is extended and complementary to a-1,3 linked mannose oligosaccharides.

517 b-sheet domains related by pseudo 3-fold symmetry. Together the three sheets form a 12-stranded b-barrel with a highly non-polar core. The structure of the GNA tetramer exhibits 222 symmetry. Of the six different isoforms for which cDNA sequences are available, the sequence which was published by Van Damme et al. (1991) is consistent with our interpretation of the electron density map. Although a completely conserved mannose binding site is present in each of the b-sheet sub-domains (termed I, II and III), MeMan was found to bind with high occupancy at one site only in all four independent subunits. This site coincides with the region of the C-terminal domain, which plays an important role in stabilizing inter-subunit contact through strand exchange. The orientation and fit of MeMan in the recognition site explains the stringent requirement for an axial OH at C-2 (Hester et al., 1995). Further structure refinement has allowed detailed analysis of the subunit conformations, solvent structure and characterization of the remaining binding sites in terms of their relative occupancies and involvement in crystal contacts. In addition, we report determination of the structure of a cubic crystal form of GNA complexed with mannose-a1,3-methyl-D-mannopy° ranoside (MeMan-2) at 3.0 A resolution, further defining the carbohydrate recognition properties of GNA in structural terms.

Introduction
Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) is a homotetrameric lectin (50 kDa) abundant in bulbs of the snowdrop plant. It is a member of a recently characterized super family of mannose-specific lectins (Amaryllidaceae, Alliaceae and Orchidaceae) that exist as both dimers and tetramers and share a high degree of sequence homology (80 to 90%). The protein is stable at high temperatures (70°C) and over a wide range of pH. In contrast to other mannosebinding lectins, these lectins lack the ability to bind glucose and interact most specifically with high mannose glycoconjugates that possess a-1,3 and a-1,6 linkages (Shibuya et al., 1988; Kaku et al., 1991). However, differences in linkage specificity have been observed among different members of the Amaryllidaceae family (Kaku & Goldstein, 1991, 1992). Precipitation assays have shown that these lectins interact strongly with branched mannans. For instance, their inhibitory effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectivity during the fusion step is attributed to specific binding interactions with mannan epitopes on the major viral glycoprotein GP120 (Balzarini et al., 1991). The crystal structure, determined for the methyl° a-D-mannose (MeMan)­GNA complex at 2.3 A resolution by MIR techniques (Hester et al., 1995), revealed a novel subunit fold composed exclusively of b-structure and is phylogenetically conserved among all members of this family. Thus, GNA represents a unique and well-defined lectin family, structurally unrelated to the distinctive families of the Gramineae and Leguminoseae (Sharon, 1993). The polypeptide has a symmetrical folding motif that consists of three four-stranded antiparallel

518 analysis. As apparent from Table 1, the model of the GNA tetramer refined with good statistics to a final R-value of 0.167 (Rfree = 0.225). This model is significantly improved over the previous model (Hester et al., 1995) and includes an additional seven bound MeMan and 204 water molecules. At the final stage several rounds of restrained least-squares structure refinement were necessary to alleviate difficulties encountered in maintaining good geometry during X-PLOR refinement. The quality of the final model was assessed by several criteria. Proper geometry was verified with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). However, the torsion angles of several non-glycine residues (V36, S49 and R92) have phi/psi angles that are out of the acceptable range in both structures. V36 and R92 are located in tight b-turns where their main-chain angles are fixed by hydrogen bonds. S49 is present in a loop region and not well determined. The low r.m.s. values listed in Table 1 for bonds and angles indicate that the model is stereochemically correct. ° The coordinate error of 0.22 A, estimated according to Luzatti (1952), is in a reasonable range considering the resolution limits of the data. Disordered regions of the model are restricted to flexible loop regions 45 to 52 and 77 to 82. The 327 water molecules refined with an average B-factor of ° 39.7 A2. Approximately 25% of these were identified in regions of subunit/subunit and lattice contacts, and 18 interact with bound saccharide. The four crystallographically independent subunits (A, B, C and D) behaved similarly during refinement. Comparing B-factor profiles, however, showed that subunit B refined with noticeably higher residue B-factors, reflecting a higher degree of mobility as a result of fewer stabilizing crystal contacts. Non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were not applied during refinement. This allowed unbiased cross-checking of poorly defined regions. For instance, electron density was observed beyond the predicted C terminus (G105) (Van Damme et al., 1991) in all four subunits, accommodating four additional residues. The C-terminal G109 in our model is, however, only clearly defined in subunit C, where it is stabilized through a lattice contact. The MeMan-2 complex was refined to a final R-factor of 0.227 and has a lower degree of precision. The limiting resolution of this cubic ° crystal form (3 A) is a result of the high solvent content (68%). In contrast to the orthorhombic structure, here the asymmetric unit contains only half of the tetramer, corresponding to subunits A and C of the orthorhombic structure. The large ° overall B-factor of 32.3 A2 is due in large part to disorder of regions restricted to subunit C only ° (Bav = 41.7 A2, see Table 1), as this subunit lacks any stabilizing contacts from neighboring molecules. In order to facilitate proper refinement with X-PLOR, NCS restraints were applied, restraining the atomic positions of both subunits to similar values. This and the use of density modification techniques helped substantially in improving the interpretabil-

ity of the electron density map. However, the C-terminal residue G109 was found to be disordered in both subunits and therefore was deleted from the model. No attempt was made to locate bound water molecules at this resolution. Despite the lesser quality of this structure, disaccharide binding was clearly interpretable at three of the six crystallographically independent binding sites. Conformational comparisons of subunits and domains The four independent subunits of the orthorhombic MeMan-GNA complex were found to possess closely similar conformations. Pairwise superpositions yielded r.m.s. discrepancies in the range of ° 0.57 to 0.75 A based on all atoms (see Table 2A). ° Values in a similar range (0.65 to 0.80 A) were obtained when comparing subunits of the two types of crystal lattice. We concluded from these results that neither molecular packing interactions specific to each lattice, nor bound saccharide

519 unreliable and thus excluded from the comparison. Some of these loop regions are flexible or participate in lattice interactions. These comparisons revealed closely similar structures of the three b-sheets; judging from the magnitudes of the r.m.s. values listed in Table 2B for all four subunits (0.33 ° to 0.51 A). Although it was expected that b-sheets II and III would compare best, because of their close sequence identity, their r.m.s. values are largest in all four subunits. Unexpectedly, sheet I, which possesses the lowest degree of internal sequence identity, compares well with sheets II ° (r.m.s.D = 0.33 to 0.37 A) and III (r.m.s.D = 0.41 to ° 0.42 A) in all subunits. Moreover, excellent superimposibility is observed for the four conserved residues in the sugar binding sites 1, 2 and 3. The binding sites located in sheets I and III compare most closely with r.m.s. discrepancies ranging from ° ° 0.22 to 0.25 A (subunits A and D) and 0.55 to 0.56 A (subunits C and D) (see Table 2C). This trend does not appear to be related to the degree of ligand occupancy at these sites. However, it suggests that mannose binding does not cause noticeable conformational changes. This is an important conclusion in view of the fact that structural studies of native GNA crystals have not been possible at this time.

disturb subunit conformation or quaternary structure of the 222 tetramer. The subunit polypeptide is folded into three quasi 3-fold related four-stranded antiparallel b-sheets, 33 to 34 amino acid residues in length. A schematic representation of their folding pattern is depicted in Figure 1. Sheet I has unique structural properties when compared with sheets II and III. It is a composite of N and C-terminal polypeptide regions. Its outer strand is borrowed from the C terminus of the dimer related subunit. Sheet II is composed of three sequentially folded strands (regions C52 to T77). Its fourth strand comes from the N-terminal region G7 to T12. In sheet III all four strands are sequential. All three sheets are stabilized by 16 to 17 backbone hydrogen bonds. The 3-fold structural symmetry manifests itself in corresponding stretches of similar sequence, as noted by Van Damme et al. (1991), and is suggestive of an evolutionary pathway involving gene duplication. In order to assess the degree of structural identity among these domains, pairwise superpositions were carried out (see Figure 2(a) and (b)). Only the main-chain atoms were considered of all those residues that contribute to pleated sheet hydrogen bonding, typically five residues per strand. Residues in loop regions were considered as

Inter-subunit contacts (modes of dimerization) The four subunits of the GNA tetramer associate with 222 point symmetry forming two types of subunit/subunit interfaces. Specific interactions between amino acid side-chains in these interfaces are the determinants of the quaternary structure of the molecule. We have analyzed these interfaces in terms of polar and non-polar contacts and buried surface area in order to assess the stability of the two types of dimers. The A-D and B -C pairs form one type and the A-B and C-D pairs the second type of dimer. In addition, this type of analysis may explain in structural terms why certain members of this lectin family are dimers and others are tetramers. Since the four subunits are crystallographically independent in the orthorhombic structure, two independent values for each interaction could be inspected. The results show large differences in the buried surface area of the two types of interfaces (see Table 3). The buried surface area of the A-D

and B-C interfaces is more than three times larger than that of the A-B/C-D interfaces. This is not surprising considering the fact that these subunits associate through C-terminal strand exchange. As expected, non-polar contacts exceed polar contacts in both interfaces. However, in the A-D/B-C

521 dinium groups of R101 (NH2 atoms) form a selfcontact across the dimer axis within hydrogen bond ° distance, ranging from 2.9 to 3.2 A in the four subunits. Since this close contact cannot be explained in terms of a compensating negative charge interaction, it is presumed that the pKa value of R101 must be locally depressed such that its guanidinium groups essentially exist in the deprotonated form. Similar close contacts involving acidic sidechains have been encountered in a range of protein structures (Flocco & Mowbray, 1995). In the absence of sufficient evidence for ordered water, which may be due to the limiting resolution of the data, and the fact that this region of the map is extremely well defined in the electron density map (see Figure 6; Hester et al., 1995), it is quite possible that strong structural constraints compensate for the shift in pKa . The R101 side-chains are immobilized through a number of additional strong H-bond contacts. Their NH2 and NE atoms interact across the dimer interface with the CO group of G98 on the dimerrelated subunit, and the NH1 atoms are involved in an H-bond contact with T99 (OG1) and a watermediated contact with the amide group of Q80 in two of the four subunits. Although it is interesting to note that this glutamine is replaced by glutamic acid in three other Amaryllidaceae lectins (daffodil, amaryllis and clivia), the fact that it is glycine in all lectins of the Alliaceae (onion) family suggests that it may not play a significant role in stabilizing this immediate area around the dimer axis. The A-B and C-D interfaces have relatively small ° buried surface areas (475 to 478 A2 ) extending in ° each direction by only about 12 and 16 A. Here inter-monomer contact is relatively weak and consists of isologous interactions between b-turns. These reverse turns are well-defined and stabilized by good H-bonds (CO of Y18--NH of F21; CO of D35--NH of K38), defining type I b-turns. There are no close direct H-bond contacts present in this interface. Contact between 2-fold-related loops Y34 to K38 is mediated by van der Waals interactions ° between side-chains of V36 and Y34 (3.75 A), the ° ° CA atoms of D37 (4.0 A), and CO of V36 (3.6 A). All residues in this loop are completely conserved in the four sequences shown in Figure 4. In the loop region of residues 17 to 20 the most important contact is formed by a water-mediated side-chain­ main-chain contact involving ND2 of N17 and CO

interfaces ten strong inter-chain backbone hydrogen bonds and 23 in which side-chains participate are present as a result of insertion of C-terminal strands into existing b-sheets. Strand insertion has also been observed in the crystal structure of panicum mosaic virus where it stabilizes monomer/monomer association (Ban & McPherson, 1995). Figure 3 illustrates the close contact of these b-sheets in the A-D interface. This region has a strained conformation with a cis-peptide bond present between G98 and cis-T99. Since proline residues are more commonly found in cis configurations, it is interesting to note that in two of the six isoforms of GNA this threonine residue (T99) is replaced by proline. In addition, four water-mediated H-bonding interactions are present in this interface. Two of these are consistent in both the A-D and B-C interfaces and they are well-ordered judging from their low B-values. Another unusual interaction is observed in this interface. The guani-

of G19. As illustrated in Figure 5, this water molecule is tetrahedrally coordinated bridging between carbonyl groups of G19 on opposite chains (see Table 4). It is present in both the A-B and C-D interfaces and appears to be essential for structure stability, judging from its low B-value (10 and ° 18 A2 ). A second, less well-ordered water molecule mediates contact between the NH of G19 and ND2 of N17. Replacement of asparagine at position 17 by serine, as is the case in two dimeric members of the Amaryllidaceae family (narcissus and clivia; see Figure 4), may either abolish or seriously weaken this interaction. The serine side-chain lacks one carbon atom and may thus be too short to form a

strong bridging hydrogen bond. Since the residues that are in direct contact in this interface are conserved among the Amaryllidaceae lectins of known sequence, we suggest that stability of tetramers depends critically on a strong H-bond network involving residues 17 and 19. Based on this analysis the GNA tetramer can be described as two loosely associated dimers (A-D and B-C). Lattice contacts In the orthorhombic crystal structure all four subunits of the tetramer are involved in packing interactions. However, the largest number of polar

Bound MeMan involved in a lattice contact at site 3 (subunit D) is shown in yellow. Figure prepared with program O (Jones T. & Kjeldgaard, 1993).

contacts are made with 2-fold screw-related molecules (-x, y + 1/2, 1/2 - z) that pack along the crystal c-dimension (shown in orange in Figure 6). Noteworthy symmetry contacts involving subunit C are a main-chain H-bond contact between the C-terminal G109 and Q80 of subunit D of the neighboring tetramer, and a sugar mediated contact involving the side-chain of N69. An ion pair contact (D37--K70) is also made between neighboring D subunits. Another sugar-mediated lattice contact involves the methyl group of MeMan bound at site 3 of subunit D (shown in yellow in Figure 6). This ° methyl group is in van der Waals contact (3.9 A) with a non-polar region (G47-L48) on subunit A of a neighboring molecule translated by one unit cell. In addition, water plays a critical role in crystal packing. A total of 61 water molecules participate in networks of three or more water molecules. In the cubic lattice of the MeMan-2 complex bound saccharide mediates crystal packing interactions. However, only A-type subunits are involved in lattice contacts, while the C-type subunits are exposed to solvent and quite mobile ° (B = 41 A2 ). As illustrated schematically in Figure 7, MeMan-2 bound at site 2 (subunit A) on tetramer 1 makes contact through its C1-Me with a non-polar region (P39, A42) on subunit B (crystallographically identical to subunit A). A water-mediated sugar/ sugar contact further stabilizes this lattice contact (see Figure 8). This water molecule bridges between the C4-OH and the C6-OH of the reducing MeMan bound in the specificity pockets of sites 2 and 3 of opposing subunits, respectively. Because binding

sites are utilized on different subunits (either A or B) in neighboring tetramers, this interaction propagates throughout the lattice and appears to be the single determining driving force for molecular packing in this cubic lattice. The fact that bound saccharide aids the crystallization process is a phenomenon observed in many lectin-saccharide crystal complexes. It can be attributed to the fact that saccharide binds in shallow surface depressions thereby changing the surface properties of the molecule. In the case of GNA, with 12 binding sites distributed over the whole surface of the tetramer, large differences in the surface properties of the substituted molecule relative to the unliganded structure would be expected.

The results of our structural analysis of the two mannoside complexes confirm that this bulb lectin is not only structurally unique but also has unique functional properties. Unlike lectins of other families that possess a single well-characterized binding site per subunit, the GNA tetramer has a capacity for binding 12 mannose residues at binding sites symmetrically distributed over its surface (see Figure 9). Each subunit contains three sites that are conserved by virtue of the 3-fold internal structure repeat. For simplicity we have labeled these sites 1, 2 and 3 according to their

Binding sites are labeled I, II and III. MeMan-2 bound at site II on one tetramer (subunit A) is in contact with a MeMan-2 bound at site III in the symmetry-related tetramer (subunit A).

b-sheet locations. They are situated at the b-turn of the two most conserved inner strands sequential in all sheets. The four residues (Asp, Asn, Gln and Tyr) that interact with monosaccharide through five to seven H-bonds, thereby conferring stereospecificity and providing the minimum binding conditions (Hester et al., 1995), are completely conserved in all three sites. The binding mode differs from that of other Man-specific lectins in that the 2-OH is strongly immobilized and not accessible for substitution. This hydroxyl and the 3-OH interact with at least two side-chains, and the 4-OH with one side-chain (Y97, Y65 and Y34 in sites 1, 2 and 3, respectively). However, the C3-OH, C1-OH and C6-OH groups are sufficiently exposed to be accessible for substitution.

ture factor refinement of all the bound MeMan molecules have confirmed our earlier results (Hester et al., 1995), which indicated that strong binding occurs only at site 1 (b-sheet I). Its location at the subunit/subunit interface (see Figure 3) allows binding to a second surface provided by the C-terminal strand of the adjacent subunit, which encircles bound mannose. The averaged atomic B-factors for MeMan, assuming full occupancy of ° site 1, are in a similar range (22 to 30 A2, see Table 4), although their magnitudes are substantially higher compared with those of essential ° amino acids in the binding sites (10 to 12 A2 ). This is not surprising in view of the surface-exposed location of these sites and the weak binding constants (24 mM; Kaku & Goldstein, 1992). Although occupancies and temperature factors are highly correlated at the resolution of the data ° (2.3 A), it is interesting to note that after two cycles of occupancy refinement with X-PLOR, the occupancies of MeMan bound at site 1 remained in the vicinity of 1.0. However, the magnitudes of the final averaged B-factors computed for MeMan after four additional cycles of positional and temperature factor refinement with PROLSQ are substantially reduced (see Table 4), which may in part be due to the refinement algorithm used in PROLSQ compared with that of X-PLOR. The degree of occupancy at sites 2 and 3 appears to be a function of involvement of bound MeMan in stabilizing lattice interactions (see Table 4). For instance, site 3 of subunit D is highly occupied due to a non-polar symmetry contact with L48. This leucine also forms a weak lattice contact with MeMan in site 2 of subunit C. At all other sites the initial high averaged B-factors (at q = 1.0) and the low refined occupancies indicate weak MeMan binding affinities and complete solvent accessibility. However, the B-factors quoted for partially occupied sites are not meaningful, as these are highly correlated with the occupancies. The refined model, which has now revealed a detailed view of all 12 binding sites, confirmed the presence of one specific water molecule in all binding sites. This water molecule solvates the ring oxygen O-5 and the C-6 hydroxyl group (see Figure 7; Hester et al., 1995). A second water molecule is observed in only half of the binding sites (sites 1 and 2 in subunits A and B, and sites 1 and 3 in subunit D).

MeMan-2 binding model
Due to the high degree of disorder in subunit C, our conclusions are primarily based on the binding modes observed in subunit A. Contact distances for MeMan-2 bound at all three sites of subunit A are listed in Table 5. In subunit C electron density for the complete disaccharide is present only at site 3 (see Figure 10), while in subunit A both sites 3 and 2 show the complete disaccharide. In site 1 the available 2Fo - Fc electron density is sufficient only for the mannose residue bound in the specificity

pocket in both subunits, suggesting that the second residue has no contact with the protein surface and is disordered. Model building revealed that it was sterically possible to fit the disaccharide to the available density with either end positioned in the specificity pocket. However, we favor the interpretation that mannosides bind to site 1 with their non-reducing residues bound in the conserved pocket, since in comparison to sites 2 and 3 additional van der Waals contacts strongly

stabilize monosaccharide binding. Recent structural results of a branched mannopentaose complex has confirmed this conclusion (unpublished results). Binding site 2 is the weakest of the three sites, since it is far removed from any dimer interface. It can achieve high occupancy only through stabilizing lattice contacts. This is the case in subunit A in this crystal form, where it is fully occupied due to sugar/sugar and a non-polar lattice contact (see Figure 8). The binding mode is analogous to that of site 3 (see below), in that the reducing Man-OMe sits in the specificity pocket. However, since there are no stabilizing contacts for the non-reducing residue, it cannot be ruled out that both binding orientations exist with equal likelihood in solution. Site 3 is the most highly occupied site in both subunits located near the A-B or C-D interface and has an extended binding region by virtue of additional interactions contributed from the dimerrelated subunit. In modeling the disaccharide to the available density, a successful fit could only be achieved with the reducing sugar (MeMan) bound in the specificity pocket in identical orientation to that observed in the MeMan monosaccharide complex. The C1-OMe points away from the protein surface, and the C3-OH is involved in the glycosidic linkage which, however, weakens its interaction with Q26 (see Figure 11(a) and (b)). The non-reducing mannose residue takes up a position such that its axial C2-OH is stabilized by H-bond interactions with the carboxylate group of D37 and the NZ atom of K38 reaching across from the opposing 2-fold-related subunit (see Figure 11). These residues are located on a b-turn that mediates A-B subunit contact. Thus, site 3 is the only site

with an extended binding region that accommodates a1,3-linked mannosides specifically and confirms the solution binding data of Goldstein and co-workers (Shibuya et al., 1988; Kaku & Goldstein, 1991). The axial C2-OH groups of both mannose residues are involved in crucial binding interactions in their respective subsites. Disaccharides with non-reducing sugars other than mannose (glucose) would be expected to bind poorly to this subsite region. However, the fact that disaccharides can bind to GNA with either the reducing or non-reducing mannose bound in the specificity pocket depending on which site is selected, contrasts with many other lectins that utilize binding modes in which the terminal non-reducing sugar occupies the specific binding pocket.

Bound disaccharide has retained an energetically favorable conformation, as no significant distortions from the ideal initial model were observed during refinement (see below). The observed values for the f and c angles of the a1,3 glycosidic linkage are 75° and 125° for MeMan-2 bound at site 2, and 52° and 99° for MeMan-2 bound at site 3, respectively. These torsion angles are in close agreement with those of low energy conformers that exist in solution (70° and 100°; Imberty et al., 1990) and with values observed in other crystal structures (Weis et al., 1992; Bourne et al., 1994). Superposition of the two bound disaccharide conformations (at sites 2 and 3) yields an r.m.s.D ° value of 0.77 A. Comparisons carried out between the two crystal structures, to evaluate how closely similar the orientations of bound MeMan are, ° yielded r.m.s values of 0.11 to 0.59 A. Although the binding affinity for monosaccharide is relatively weak, the large number of hydrogen bonds (see Table 5) confer strict stereo-specificity on the binding process.

Conclusions
The crystal structure of GNA has revealed yet another example of a polypeptide fold that serves as a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The GNA CRD is a pure b-sheet domain with a completely conserved monosaccharide recognition site strictly specific for a-D-mannose. This contrasts with less discriminating lectins, such as the Gramineae and Leguminoseae lectins which bind

two types of sugar (Goldstein & Poretz, 1986; Sharon, 1993). Combined results from the mono- and disaccharide crystal complexes revealed that GNA is the first plant lectin for which two binding modes are observed within the same subunit, suggesting the likelihood that GNA utilizes multiple binding modes when it binds to complex oligo-mannan receptors. In both binding environments auxiliary interactions from a 2-fold-related subunit are specificity determining. (1) Site 1 is utilized for binding monosaccharides or terminal mannose with high occupancy. The residue bound in the specificity pocket is further stabilized through

numerous van der Waals contacts from the C-terminal arm of the contacting subunit. (2) In the absence of such auxiliary contacts, as is the case at sites 2 and 3, monosaccharide occupancy is substantially reduced (30 to 50%), as established by occupancy refinement of the 12 bound MeMan molecules in the GNA-MeMan complex. (3) Site 3 (on b-sheet III) is the only site with an extended binding region complementary to a1,3 linked mannosides. The a1,3 linked reducing end of the bound dimannoside is positioned in the conserved pocket. Subsidiary contacts from a second subunit form a subsite which stabilizes the non-reducing mannose residue.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization Both mannoside complexes were crystallized from ammonium sulfate by the method of vapor diffusion. Crystallization of the MeMan complex has been described by Wright et al. (1990). Crystals of the Man­a1,3-methyl-Man complex were prepared from 25 mg/ml protein solutions containing 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) and 0.023 M MeMan-2, which constitutes a 56-fold molar excess of sugar over protein tetramers. Large diamond-shaped crystals appeared within two weeks (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm). These crystals belong to the cubic space group I21 3 with cell dimensions a = b = c = ° 138.16 A. Data collection and processing X-ray intensity data collection, processing and scaling of the MeMan complex was carried out as described (Hester et al., 1995). Intensity measurements for the ° MeMan-2 complex were made on two crystals. A 3 A dataset was collected at the multiwire area X-ray diffraction (MAXD) facility (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA: Sobottka et al., 1984), where it was also processed. These data were merged and scaled using programs ROTAVATA and AGROVATA (Collaborative ° Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). A second 2 A dataset was measured on a R-AXIS IIC imaging plate system mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray generator at this institution, and processed, scaled and merged with programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). Analysis of the processed R-AXIS ° data indicated a limiting resolution of 3 A. Data and scaling statistics are presented in Table 6. Molecular replacement The structure of the MeMan complex was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement technique as described by Hester et al. (1995). Structure determination of the cubic MeMan-2 complex was subsequently carried out by molecular replacement using the GNA structure of the refined MeMan complex as the search model. All calculations were carried out using programs from the

CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Self rotation functions were calculated with program ° POLARRFN using data in the resolution ranges 12 to 6 A ° and 12 to 4 A. Peak analysis of the rotation maps using the program ROTMAT revealed the presence of only one local 2-fold axis. This result was unexpected in view of our earlier assumption that the complete tetramer is contained in the asymmetric unit, and in view of the reasonable values obtained for the crystal solvent content ° (45%) and partial molar volume (2.24 A/dalton). To confirm this curious result, a cross-rotation vector map ° was calculated in the 8 to 4 A with the program AMORE (Navaza, 1994). The cross-rotation function was sampled in steps of 1° and the integration radius was varied in ° ° steps of 5 A from 15 to 30 A. The best signal-to-noise ratio ° was obtained with a radius of 30 A. The rotation and translation functions displayed a high signal-to-noise ratio and were easily interpretable. Although a satisfactory solution was obtained in terms of a favorable R-factor and correlation coefficient, when the complete tetramer was used as search model, packing analysis indicated strong overlap between neighboring molecules. From this analysis we concluded that our tetrameric trial model was incorrect. Taking into account that the self rotation map yielded a single peak, we repeated the rotational searches with other test models consisting of all possible combinations of one, two or three subunits. An unambiguous solution, yielding an R-factor of 47%, a correlation coefficient of 37% and satisfactory packing contacts, was obtained with the combination of subunits A and C (see Figure 7). The reduced crystal packing density accounts for a rather high solvent content of 68%. The space group ambiguity was resolved to be I21 3 from analysis of the translation function searches and packing interactions. Subsequent rigid body refinement of this model with AMORE reduced the R-factor and correlation coefficient to 45.3% and 41.9%, respectively. Refinement Both crystal complexes were refined with the program package X-PLOR (Brunger et al., 1987, 1992b; version 3.0 ¨ and 3.1.f). The following conditions were used in all refinement rounds. Simulated annealing with ``slow cooling'' was performed under conditions of Tinit = 4000 K; Tend = 300 K; Dt = 0.5 fs; DT = - 25 K every 50

steps. The weighting factor (Wa ) of the crystallographic Ex term was initially determined by a short molecular dynamics run in the absence of the effective X-ray energy term. During most refinement rounds only a fractional portion of this weight (typically 50 to 70%) was used in order to weight the geometry more strongly. However, in the case of the MeMan complex it was necessary to switch to the stereochemical restrained least-squares refinement method of Hendrickson & Konnert (1980, program, PROLSQ) to improve regions of the model that persistently showed unsatisfactory geometry. Atomic positions and B-factors were refined in all rounds. Initial ° B-factors for protein and sugar atoms were set to 15 A2 ° and water atoms to 20 A2. Refinement progress was monitored through inspection of Rfree to allow cross-validation of the model (Brunger, 1992a). In the MeMan and ¨ MeMan-2 refinements this R-factor was based on a randomly selected fraction (5 to 7%) of the data. Initially the standard parameters of X-PLOR were used. Later we switched to the parameters described by Engh & Huber (1991). Parameter and topology files for MeMan were generated based on existing data in the X-PLOR parameter and topology files and on small molecule crystal structures. These MeMan coordinates were idealized by performing a molecular dynamics run (5000 steps of 1 fs at 1000 K) and energy minimization (1000 cycles). Inspection of electron density maps and interactive modeling between refinement cycles were performed with the graphics program O (Jones & Kjeldgaard, 1993; Jones et al., 1991). After each refinement round 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps were calculated with the CCP4 program package, using coefficients generated with SIGMAA (Read, 1986). Quality of the model was assessed at each stage using PROCHECK (Laskowski, 1993).

Refinement protocol for the MeMan-2 complex
Initially simulated annealing test runs were performed on both the MAXD and RAXIS datasets, using identical protocols (NCS constraints, Wa reduced by 70% of the calculated value) in order to determine the quality of these two datasets. The results showed that Rfree and the average overall B-factor had lower values in the case of the R-AXIS dataset (33.63 versus 37.01% and 19.1 versus ° 34.2 A2, respectively). It is, however, noteworthy that the quality of the 2Fo - Fc map was comparable for both datasets. Nevertheless, the R-AXIS data set was chosen for further refinements. A total of five rounds were performed using only data ° in the 8 to 3 A resolution range with an Fo cut-off of 2s(Fo ). In order to improve the overall orientation of the molecular replacement model, two steps of rigid body refinement were initially performed. The two subunits were first refined together as one rigid body and then individually, which decreased the Rfree value from 37.1 to 33.9%. Three simulated annealing rounds followed using NCS constraints in rounds one and two to allow for a larger ratio of experimental observations versus adjustable model parameters. In round three NCS restraints were utilized dividing the model into two groups of equivalent atoms (subunits A and C). An effective energy ° (Eeff ) constant of 300 kcal/mol A2 for positional NCS ° restraints and a target deviation (sncs ) of 2.0 A2 for B-factor NCS restraints was applied. In order to retain best possible geometry the weight of the energy term for bond lengths and angles was increased from 1.0 to 1.1. Harmonic restraints for non-hydrogen atoms were set to ° 10.0 and 20.0 kcal/mol A2 for non-Ca and Ca atoms, respectively. Two B-factors were refined per residue and the Ex weight Wa was reduced to 50% of the calculated value. Because of the limiting resolution of the data, we used twofold averaging, solvent flattening and density histogram matching to improve the phase information after refinement round one with the program DM (version 1. 6.1) of the CCP4 program suite. The ``reflect omit'' mode was utilized dividing the data into 20 test sets of about 400 reflections each (i.e. density modification is performed excluding each test set in turn to reduce dependency between initial and modified structure factors). The method of Read (1986) was used for phase combination. After three rounds in which the solvent level was gradually increased from 30 to 60% the free R-factor dropped from 47.1 to 29.4% and the real space R-factor from 12.7 to 8.2%. The resulting electron density map was examined and used together with the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps for model building. No attempt was made to locate water molecules at this resolution. The ligand MeMan-2 was fitted to all three binding sites in both subunits and was refined in rounds two to five. Idealized coordinates from a preliminary molecular dynamics run, as described above, were used for model construction. Weak electron density was observed in sites 1 of subunit A and C and site 2 of subunit C, sufficient only for fitting a single mannose residue. B-Factors of ° these sugar atoms tended to increase above 50 A2 after refinement round three. We experimented with alterna-

Refinement protocol for MeMan complex
A total of 17 rounds were performed. In 13 of these the model was refined with X-PLOR, either by simulated annealing (in rounds 1 to 5 and 9) or by conventional energy minimization (Brunger et al., 1987). The program ¨ PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980) was used in the final four refinement rounds. Structure factor data with Fo < 2s(Fo ) were omitted in the refinement. However, final R-factors and electron density maps were based on all data. During the first three rounds the model consisted of protein atoms only. Resolution limits were gradually ° increased from 3.0 to 2.3 A. At this stage five MeMan molecules could be fitted unambiguously to well defined electron density and were added to the model structure (Hester et al., 1995). During rounds five to seven four additional residues were added at the C-terminal end in each subunit, and the presence of a cis-peptide was established between residues G98-T99 (Hester et al., 1995). In rounds eight and nine MeMan was built into the seven remaining binding sites and refined with full occupancy until cycle 12. At this stage the occupancies of MeMan (one value for each bound molecule) were refined in two cycles, and their values retained during the final four cycles of positional and B-factor refinement with PROLSQ. Water molecules were selected from Fo - Fc difference maps at the 3s level. A distance criterion was applied using the program WATERPEAK, and only peaks within ° 1.5 to 5 A distance of a protein or sugar atom were accepted. A final check was done by graphical inspection

tive conformations for the disaccharide bound in site 1 (opposite orientations of the disaccharide) without satisfactory success. In round three alternative conformations were also unsuccessfully refined for K38, which plays a role in sugar binding. The C-terminal residue G109 was deleted from each chain due to lack of sufficient density in this region of the electron density map. In refinement round four NCS restraints were only applied to protein atoms, which were divided into four groups. To release the NCS restraints, Eeff and sncs ° ° were set to values of 200 kcal/mol A2 and 1.5 A2 for ° ° main-chain atoms and to 100 kcal/mol A2 and 2.0 A2 for side-chain atoms. MeMan-2 atoms were subjected to ° harmonic restraints of 10.0 kcal/mol A2. Two B-factors per residue were refined and these were reset if they ° refined to values outside the range of 10 to 50 A2. In round five NCS restraints had to be tightened to avoid overfitting of the data (Brunger, 1992b). The model was ¨ divided into two groups of equivalent atoms (including sugar atoms) applying values for Eeff and sncs of ° ° 250 kcal/mol A2 and 2.0 A2, respectively. No additional modifications were made to the model and the refinement converged with a final R-factor of 22.7% (see Table 1).

Model analysis Structure comparisons between subunits, domains and binding sites were carried out by the method of Kabsch (1976) using the program LSQKAB in the CCCP4 program package. The buried surface areas for the two types of subunit/subunit interfaces were derived from the solvent-accessible surface areas, calculated with X-PLOR using the algorithm of Lee & Richards (1971). The atomic coordinates for the refined models of GNA-MeMan and GNA-MeMan-2 are available from the Brookhaven Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977) under entry codes IMSA and INIV.
