Abstract The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum is increasingly be used for the overexpression of proteins. Dictyostelium is amenable to classical and molecular genetic approaches and can easily be grown in large quantities. It contains a variety of chaperones and folding enzymes, and is able to perform all kinds of post-translational protein modifications. Here, new expression vectors are presented that have been designed for the production of proteins in large quantities for biochemical and structural studies. The expression cassettes of the most successful vectors are based on a tandem affinity purification tag consisting of an octahistidine tag followed by the myosin motor domain tag. The myosin motor domain not only strongly enhances the production of fused proteins but is also used for a fast affinity purification step through its ATP-dependent binding to actin. The applicability of the new system has been demonstrated for the expression and purification of subunits of the dynein­dynactin motor protein complex from different species. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, is an attractive eukaryotic host for recombinant protein expression. In contrast to tissue cultures of mammalian or insect cells, Dictyostelium cells grow fast, and large quantities of cells can be produced easily and cheaply in shake cultures or fermentors [1,2]. Dictyostelium is non-pathogenic, requires no serum or other animal proteins for growth, and is capable of performing post-translational protein modifications [3] and secreting high levels of protein [4]. Dictyostelium grows as single cells, but

a developmental phase can be triggered by starvation, leading to the formation of a multicellular organism, which then differentiates to produce a fruiting body composed of spores on a stalk. Many transformation vectors exist for the temporal- or spatial-specific expression of mutated or tagged proteins. Three classes of vectors are used for the expression of proteins in Dictyostelium: (A) integrating plasmids (e.g. [5]); (B) plasmids allowing autonomous Ddp1-based replication (e.g. [6]); (C) plasmids allowing Ddp2-based extrachromosomal replication (e.g. [7]). The latter vectors require the presence of the Ddp2 ORF product for autonomous replication, which is known to be essential in trans for plasmid maintenance, while an approximately 600 bp fragment, presumably containing the Ddp2 origin of replication, is required in cis [8,9]. This can be achieved either by the use of the AX3-ORF+ cells that carry integrated copies of the Ddp2 ORF gene, or by co-transformation with plasmids such as pREP, which carry a copy of the ORF gene. To enhance protein production, and to facilitate protein purification, a similar set of fusion-tags and ­proteins that are used in bacteria has been established for Dictyostelium. Initially these vectors contained only multiple cloning sites with few restriction sites, and either N- or C-terminal poly-histidine or c-myc tags [7]. This set of vectors was extended by adding Flag-, Strep-, GST- (all reported in [10]), myosin motor domain-tags

[11], and MBP-tags [12] as expression and purification aids. A tag only used in Dictyostelium is the motor domain of class II myosin as an N-terminal fusion construct. Class II myosin is one of the most abundantly expressed proteins in Dictyostelium. It has been shown that the motor domain not only enhances the expression of C-terminally fused Dictyostelium proteins like actinin [11] or the GTPase domain of dynaminA [13], but also increases expression levels of heterologous protein such as the GTPase domain of rat dynamin1 [14]. However, more experimental data that confirms the general feasibility of the method are still missing. In addition to its expression-enhancing capabilities, the myosin motor domain provides a very fast and specific affinity purification step through its ATP-dependent binding to actin. Furthermore, the development of appropriate mild lysis conditions [7] has strongly reduced proteolysis problems that are commonly encountered during the extraction procedure for many cells. Here, the general applicability of the motor domain of class II myosin from Dictyostelium as fusion tag for the expression of homologous and heterologous proteins is shown. The method has thoroughly been improved and tested for the expression of the subunits of the dynein­dynactin motor protein complex from different species. The dynein­dynactin motor protein complex is an essential component of eukaryotic cells and responsible for cellular processes such as the transport of organelles or chromosomes. Dynein is the engine providing the power and dynactin is the coordinator and regulator of the different activities, including binding to the cargos. The subunits of the complex include the heavy chain (540 kDa, all molecular weights are given for the Dictyostelium homologs), intermediate chain (72 kDa), light­intermediate chain (55 kDa), and three light chains (LC8, 11 kDa; TcTex-1, 13 kDa; Roadblock, 12 kDa) belonging to dynein, and p24 (25 kDa), p25 (20 kDa), p27 (20 kDa), capZ (cap , 34 kDa; cap , 32 kDa), ARP1 (43 kDa), ARP11 (53 kDa), actin (45 kDa), dynamitin (also called p50, 48 kDa), p62 (69 kDa) and p150Glued (173 kDa) belonging to dynactin (Fig. 1). Four of the subunits have already been expressed in large quantities [15,16] and the structures of two of them have subsequently been solved [17,18]. With the new vectors it is now possible to express all dynein­dynactin subunits except for the dynein heavy chain, p150Glued and ARP1 as myosin-fusion proteins in Dictyostelium. Several of these proteins have already been purified.

mako1rc were used, while the pDXA-mako3 vector was constructed using mako5 and mako6. The oligonucleotides (3 nM each) were hybridized at 95  C for 5 min and allowed to cool down to room temperature over night. The hybridized oligos mako1/mako1rc were digested with Hind I and Xho I and ligated into the digested pDXA-HY. The hybridized oligos mako5/mako6 were directly ligated into pDXA-HY digested with Hind I and Xho I. 2.1.2. pDXA-mako2b (Fig. 2) A PCR-based strategy was used to introduce the his-tag and the thrombin cleavage site N-terminal to the myosin motor domain and the combined TEV cleavage site/multiple cloning site at the C-terminus. The gene encoding the myosin motor domain of DdMhcA was obtained from the plasmid pM765mcs (D.J. Manstein, personal communication). The PCR using mako2 and mako3 produced a fragment of 2.4 kb that was introduced into the pCR® 2.1-TOPO® vector according to the manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The resulting plasmid was digested once with Hind III and Eco31 I, and once with Eco31 I and Xho I (Hind III also cuts the second fragment). Both fragments were ligated at once into the pDXA-HY vector digested with Hind III and Xho I. The resulting plasmid (pDXA-mako2) was digested with Mlu I and Sph I, and a similarly digested fragment of pDXA-mako was introduced to remove cloning artefacts from the pCR® 2.1-TOPO® vector. 2.1.3. pDXA-mako4b (Fig. 2) A PCR-based strategy similar to that used for the creation of pDXA-mako2b was applied to create a vector with a different TEV cleavage site/multiple cloning site at the C-terminus of the myosin motor domain. The primer mako2 and mako7 were used in the PCR reaction. The resulting PCR fragment of 2.4 kb was digested with BseJ I and Xho I, and ligated into pDXA-mako2 digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid (pDXA-mako4) was digested with Mlu I and Sph I, and a similarly digested fragment of pDXA-mako was introduced to remove cloning artefacts. 2.2. Construction of myosin-fusion protein plasmids The genes encoding dynein and dynactin subunits or other proteins were amplified from genomic DNA or cDNA sources using standard PCR techniques and cloned into the appropriate pDXA-mako vectors. More information about the choice of the genes as well as the exact borders of gene fragments, when domains have been expressed, will be given somewhere else (Kollmar, unpublished data). 2.3. Dictyostelium transformation Cells from the D. discoideum strain AX3-ORF+ were grown in HL-5c medium (5 g/l Proteose Peptone, 2.5 g/l Trypton/Pepton from casein, 2.5 g/l Bacto Tryptone, 5 g/l Bacto Yeast Extract, 10 g/l d-glucose 1.2 g/l anhydrous KH2 PO4 , 0.35 g/l anhydrous Na2 HPO4 ) containing 40 units penicillin/streptomycin per ml of medium (HL-5c/PS). At a density

of 2 × 106 to 6 × 106 cells/ml cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed two times with ice-cold electroporation buffer (10 mM KPi , pH 6.1; 50 mM sucrose) and then resuspended in electroporation buffer to yield a cell density of 1.5­2 × 107 cells/ml. 0.8 ml of this cell suspension were mixed with 10­20 g of plasmid DNA and transferred into a 4 mm electroporation cuvette. After 5 min on ice, the cells were electroporated with a BioRad Genepulser II system (1.2 kV; 3 F; 600 ) and immediately returned to ice. After 10 min, 250 l of the cell suspension were added to a 10 cm Petri dish containing 10 ml HL-5c/PS and allowed to recover for 18­24 h. Then the medium was replaced by HL-5c/PS medium containing 10 g/ml geneticin (G418). 2.4. Myosin-fusion maxi-preparation Cells transformed with a myosin-fusion construct were grown at 21  C ± 2  C in 5 l Erlenmeyer flasks each containing a maximum of 2.5 l of HL-5c/PS medium containing 5 g/ml G418. Cells were shaken at 180 rpm. For a typical preparation 10 l of cell culture were grown yielding about 50 g of cells (wet weight). At a density of 6 × 106 to 1 × 107 cells/ml cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 7 min. The cells were washed with cold PBS buffer, centrifuged again, and the wet weight of the cell pellet was determined. At this stage, the cells were either lysed directly (option A) or stored frozen and lysed upon thawing (option B). Option A: cells were resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer/g cells (lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.0; 2 mM EDTA; 0.2 mM EGTA; 1 mM DTT; protease Inhibitor Mix (60 g/ml N-CBZPA, 100 g/ml TAME, 80 g/ml TPCK, 2 g/ml Pepstatin, 5 g/ml Leupeptin); 5 mM benzamidine; 40 g/ml TLCK; 40 g/ml PMSF; 0.02% NaN3 ). Once suspended, an additional 2 ml/g cells of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton-X100, 1 l RNAaseA solution per ml end volume of lysis buffer (heat treated RNAaseA; 15 mg/ml in 10 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 50% glycerol) and 100 units of alkaline phosphatase were added. Option B: Cells were resuspended in 6 ml of lysis buffer/g of cells. Then cells were quick-frozen by pipetting them into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80  C. For a protein preparation cells were allowed to thaw on ice to 0  C which causes cell lysis. Fifteen micrograms RNAaseA per ml end volume of lysis buffer and 100 units of alkaline phosphatase were added to the lysate. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4  C. After centrifugation at 186,000 × g for 50 min, the pellet was washed in 100 ml of extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.3; 100 mM NaCl; 30 mM KAc; 10 mM MgAc; 5 mM benzamidine; 40 g/ml PMSF) and the suspension centrifuged again at 186,000 × g for 50 min. The myosin-fusion was extracted by homogenising the pellet in 2 volumes/g cells of extraction buffer containing 20 mM ATP. The homogenate was centrifuged at 370,000 × g for 50 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen Inc.) and subsequently washed with 10 column volumes of low salt buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.3; 30 mM KAc), 10 column volumes of high salt buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.3; 300 mM KAc), and 10 column volumes of low salt buffer containing 25 mM imidazole pH 7.3. The myosinfusion was eluted using a linear gradient of low salt buffer and

40

imidazole buffer (500 mM imidazole pH 7.3), starting with 5% imidazole buffer and reaching 100% after 8 column volumes. Peak fractions were collected and dialyzed over night (50 mM HEPES pH 7.3; 1 mM MgAc; 0.5 mM EDTA; 0.2 mM EGTA; 1 mM benzamidine). If the myosin-fusions did not show major proteolysis, they were further polished by size-exclusion chromatography. Major proteolysis products were separated with ion-exchange chromatography, either using MonoS or MonoQ columns (GE Healthcare/Amersham Bioscience). 2.5. Myosin-fusion mini-preparation Cells were resuspended from a well confluent 10 cm Petri dish in 1 ml of Bonner's solution (10 mM NaCl; 10 mM KCl; 2 mM CaCl2 ). Cells were collected at 600 g for 10 min and resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. Once suspended, an additional 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton-X100, 1 l RNAaseA solution and 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase were added. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,100 × g at 4  C for 10 min. The myosinfusion was extracted by homogenising the pellet in 100 l of extraction buffer containing 20 mM ATP. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,100 × g at 4  C for 10 min and the supernatant submitted to SDS electrophoresis. 3. Results and discussion The rationale for the design of the new expression system was based on the intention to obtain proteins suitable for structural studies. For structural studies proteins have to be produced in large quantities, the protein sample should be as pure and homogenous as possible, and, of course, the protein should be functional. Given the need for posttranslational modifications or specific folding aides, most of the eukaryotic proteins cannot be produced in bacteria in functional form. Therefore, a set of cloning vectors designed to enhance the production and to facilitate the purification of proteins in the cellular slime mold D. discoideum, a lower eukaryote, was generated. 3.1. Design of the expression vectors The Dictyostelium­E. coli shuttle vector pDXA-HY [7] provided the basis for the new vectors for several reasons. This vector contains the actin-6 promoter driven G418 resistance cassette for selection in Dictyostelium that allows obtaining consistently high transformation efficiency, and yields very high copy numbers of plasmids in the transformants (about 500 copies of the plasmids in the transformants). To get high copy numbers of plasmids is one of the essential prerequisites for strong protein expression. Vectors containing the blasticidin resistance cassette also show high transformation efficiency but result in less than 10 copies of the plasmid in the transformant [19]. In contrast, hygromycin resistance containing plasmids in general give high copy numbers (about 300 copies per transformant) but the consistency and reproducibility strongly depends on the selection conditions that need to be determined carefully [10,19]. Another reason for choosing pDXA-HY was the actin-15 promoter at the beginning of the expression cassette that is one of

the strongest constitutive promoters in Dictyostelium. In addition to these features, the pDXA-HY vector carries the origin of replication of the Dictyostelium high-copy-number plasmid Ddp2, a highcopy-number origin of replication for E. coli plasmids, the bacterial ampicillin resistance gene, and, as part of the expression cassette, a small multiple cloning site followed by the polyadenylation and termination signals of the so-called Dd10 gene. The pDXA-mako and pDXA-mako3 vectors were created by exchanging the his-tag and multiple cloning site of pDXA-HY with an eight-histidine tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site (Fig. 2). Restriction sites for the N-termini of the genes of interest were included into the TEV cleavage site while further restriction sites for the C-terminal ends were added behind it. Both vectors only differ in the restriction sites introduced into the TEV cleavage site. The new design of the expression cassette was based on three criteria. First, the octahistidine tag is thought to bind stronger to the Ni-NTA matrix than the heptahistidine tag. This might especially be true for proteins where the N-terminus is not really sticking out of the core domain. Second, for subsequent biochemical, biophysical or structural studies it is very desirable to obtain proteins without additional amino acids resulting from cloning artifacts, protease cleavage sites, or expression and purification tags. As tags are a major advantage in improving sample purity, and in simplifying and standardizing purification procedures, the method of choice is to remove these tags using proteases after the purification of the protein. All common proteases cleave either in the middle or at the C-terminus of their recognition sequence. To remove all additional amino acids it is therefore necessary to place the purification tags at the N-termini of the proteins. The best proteases would be either Factor Xa or enterokinase removing all extra amino acids. However, both are relatively expensive, inefficient, and nonsequence specific, and are therefore not suited for cleaving large quantities of protein [20]. The TEV protease, however, recognizes a specific heptapeptide sequence, E-X-XY-X-QS/G, and is active under a wide range of conditions and even in the presence of various protease inhibitors [21]. In addition, the TEV protease can easily be recombinantly expressed. The TEV protease leaves either a serine or a glycine at the Nterminus of the protein, but these small residues are not expected to interfere with the function of the protein. The third criterion, which is closely related to the second one, was the choice of the restriction sites. It is not desirable to rebuild the whole TEV cleavage site with every new construct, and the restriction sites should also not be placed behind it because this would result in extra non-native residues at the N-terminus of the protein of interest. Thus, the restriction sites have to be included in the TEV cleavage site. The recognition sequence shows two variable positions that can be used to introduce restriction sites. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, the neighboring bases can also slightly be adjusted still resulting in the same translation. The choice of the restriction sites was further limited by the sites already included in pDXA-HY and by the intention to exclude any sites that would result in the introduction of rare codons [22]. It is known that the frequencies with which different codons are used vary significantly between different organisms, between

The regions encoding ampicillin resistance (Ampicillin R), the origin of replication for the E. coli plasmid (ColE1 origin) and the Dictyostelium plasmid (Ddp2 ori), the neomycin resistance cassette (Pact6, G418 resistance, CP1 termination), the constitutive actin15 promotor (Pact15), the gene termination signal (Dd10 termination), and the myosin-fusion cassette (thrombin cleavage site, myosin motor domain, TEV cleavage site) are indicated. The exact sequences of the multiple cloning sites as well as the thrombin cleavage sites are given below. The pDXA-mako and pDXA-mako3 vectors lack the thrombin cleavage site as well as the myosin motor domain resulting in vector sizes of 6122 bp.

proteins expressed at high or low level within the same organism, and sometimes even within the same operon (reviewed in [23]). It has also been shown, that an optimization of the 5 codon usage enhanced the expression of heterologous proteins several fold [22,23]. Therefore, rare codons, that would already freeze the translation after a few residues, should be avoided. These limits resulted in the construction of two vectors with different restriction sites incorporated into the TEV cleavage site. The Nhe I, Mlu I and Xho I restriction sites are based on rare codons and were therefore intended to only be used for the 3 ends of the genes. The pDXA-mako2b and pDXA-mako4b vectors differ from the corresponding pDXA-mako and pDXA-mako3 vectors by the insertion of the motor domain of class II myosin from D. discoideum as additional purification tag between the octahistidine tag and the TEV-cleavage site. N-terminal to the myosin motor domain, a thrombin cleavage site was added to provide the opportunity to remove the histidine tag. The myosin motor domain is, with a molecular weight of 87 kDa, the largest expression and purification tag that has been used so far. It has extensively been used for the expression of myosin S1 mutants (the myosin motor domain "fused" to its own light chain binding domain), and fusions of the motor domain to one to three repeats of -actinin for biochemical and biophysical studies (for example [24,25]). Recently, the X-ray structures of the following fusion proteins have been reported: repeats 1 and 2 of Dictyostelium -actinin [11], the GTPase domain of Dictyostelium dynaminA [13], and the GTPase domain of rat dynamin1 [14]. However, the constructs used show some disadvantages that considerably limit their application as general expression vectors. The -actinin fusion has a single Xho I restriction site between the two parts (resulting in three nonnative residues) and a C-terminal octahistidine tag immediately followed by a stop codon. In this case, the octahistidine tag would have to be added separately for every construct, as well as an optional protease cleavage site that would still add some non-native residues to the C-terminus of the fusion. The vector used for the dynamin fusions was an advanced version of the original construct, placing the histidine tag at the N-terminus of the myosin motor domain and adding a thrombin cleavage site in front of the GTPase domain. This vector does still not allow to remove the histidine tag and only contains the single Xho I restriction site 5 of the thrombin cleavage site. The new pDXA-mako2b and pDXA-mako4b vectors have been designed to further improve the applicability of the myosin motor domain as fusion tag. These constructs allow the optional cleavage of the N-terminal octahistidine tag and the cleavage of the myosin motor domain while only adding a glycine to the N-terminus of the protein of interest, and contain several restriction sites that do not cut in any protein. 3.2. Application of the new vector series The pDXA-mako vector series has been designed for the standardized large-scale expression and purification of eukaryotic proteins in the cellular slime mold D. discoideum. It was developed and tested for the expression of the subunits of the

Ten microlitres samples of each of the ATPextracts were loaded onto a 10% SDS gel. The calculated sizes of the proteins are as follows (in addition to the myosin motor domain of 87 kDa): Mm p24, 24 kDa; Dd p25, 20 kDa; Mm p27, 25 kDa; Dd ARP11, 53 kDa; Dd p50, 48 kDa; Dd p62, 69 kDa; Dd robl, 12 kDa; Dd LC8, 11 kDa; Dd DynLIC, 55 kDa; Dd DynIC, 72 kDa; Dd DynHC"AAA1", 121 kDa; Hs DynHCStalk, 31 kDa.

dynein­dynactin motor protein complex as well as other proteins ranging from cytoskeletal proteins to enzymes and signaling proteins. Attempts to express dynein/dynactin subunits in E. coli have been unsuccessful (Schroer, personal communication) except for four cases [15­18]. Expression of the other proteins in E. coli also failed. The genes of the dynein­dynactin complex have been obtained from genomic DNA (Dictyostelium) or cDNA sources (different organisms) and cloned into the appropriate vectors of the new series. The plasmids were introduced into cells of Dictyostelium strain AX3-ORF+ by electroporation, and transformants were selected for G418 resistance. Clonal transformants were then selected and grown further for analysis. The protein expression levels using the pDXA-mako or pDXA-mako3 vectors were too low for structural studies (data not shown). But as fusions to the myosin motor domain all dynein­dynactin subunits, except for the dynein heavy chain, p150Glued and ARP1, could finally be expressed in large to very large quantities. The transformants have been screened for expression applying a myosin-fusion mini-preparation. Samples of the supernatants after dissociation of the acto-myosin complex are shown in Fig. 3. The myosin motor domain tag strongly enhances the expression of Dictyostelium proteins as well as proteins from mammals. The use of many rare codons in the heterologous genes therefore does not abolish the translation process if genes are placed C-terminal to the myosin motor domain. Some of the proteins have been purified from 10 l or 15 l of cell culture for subsequent biochemical and structural studies (Fig. 4). For the large-scale purification of myosin fusion proteins, the standardized protocol includes three purification steps

as follows: first, cells are lysed and ATP-depleted. The absence of a cell wall allows rapid lysis of Dictyostelium cells under mild conditions. Thus, low percentages of Triton X-100, or a simple round of freezing and thawing, together with the optional addition of alkaline phosphatase, allows recovery of eventually all of the fusion protein in the cytoskeletal fraction. Second, ATP-released active fusion protein is applied to a Ni2+ -affinity column. Third, as a final step either ion-exchange and/or sizeexclusion chromatography is used, depending on the purity of the eluate from the Ni-NTA column. From the very strongly expressing Dd robl and Dd LC8 constructs, over 150 mg of fusion protein have been obtained from 5 l of cell culture. From the other constructs, 10­50 mg of fusion protein is purified from 10­15 l of cell culture. Thus, enough protein is obtained for subsequent biochemical analyses or crystallization. To demonstrate the general feasibility of the method, many other proteins from different species have successfully been expressed (Fig. 5) and purified (Fig. 4), including cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes, and signaling proteins.

4. Conclusions As has been shown, the myosin system is a very useful system for the expression of a wide range of proteins not only from Dictyostelium but also from other species. Because of the shown expression levels, and because of the facile and cheap production of cells, this system will become more than an alternative to the more commonly used eukaryotic expression systems.

Fig. 5. Screening of Dictyostelium transformants expressing myosin-fusions of various proteins. Samples were prepared according to the myosin-fusion minipreparation. Ten microlitres samples of each of the ATP-extracts were loaded onto a 10% SDS gel. The calculated sizes of the proteins are as follows (in addition to the myosin motor domain of 87 kDa): pMK99 (Dd domain from cytoskeletal protein): 25 kDa; pMK103 (Dd ATPase domain): 85 kDa; pMK139 (Dd ATPase domain): 81 kDa; pMK6 (Hs cytoskeletal protein): 51 kDa; pMK15 (Dd cytoskeletal protein): 49 kDa; pMK78 (Sc cytoskeletal protein): 73 kDa; pMK65 (Dd GAP domain containing protein): 104 kDa; pMK123 (Dd pyrophosphatase): 46 kDa; pMK42 (Dd signaling protein): 42 kDa; pMK47 (Dd signaling protein): 48 kDa; pMK107 (Dd signaling protein): 47 kDa; pMK102l (Dd signaling protein): 39 kDa.
