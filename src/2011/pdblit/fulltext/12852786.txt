The nuclear import of simian-virus-40 large T-antigen (tumour antigen) is enhanced via phosphorylation by the protein kinase CK2 at Ser112 in the vicinity of the NLS (nuclear localization sequence). To determine the structural basis of the effect of the sequences flanking the basic cluster KKKRK, and the effect of phosphorylation on the recognition of the NLS by the nuclear import factor importin- (Imp), we co-crystallized non-autoinhibited Imp with peptides corresponding to the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of the NLS, and determined the crystal structures of the complexes. The structures show that the amino acids N-terminally flanking the basic cluster make specific contacts with the receptor that are distinct from the interactions between bipartite NLSs and Imp. We confirm the important role of flanking sequences using binding assays. Un-

expectedly, the regions of the peptides containing the phosphorylation site do not make specific contacts with the receptor. Binding assays confirm that phosphorylation does not increase the affinity of the T-antigen NLS to Imp. We conclude that the sequences flanking the basic clusters in NLSs play a crucial role in nuclear import by modulating the recognition of the NLS by Imp, whereas phosphorylation of the T-antigen enhances nuclear import by a mechanism that does not involve a direct interaction of the phosphorylated residue with Imp. Key words: importin- (karyopherin-), nuclear localization sequence recognition (NLS recognition), phosphorylation, simianvirus-40 (SV40) large tumour-antigen nuclear localization sequence, X-ray crystal structure.

INTRODUCTION

Nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs through nuclear pore complexes, large supramolecular structures that penetrate the double lipid layer of the nuclear envelope. Most macromolecules require an active, signal-mediated transport process that enables the passage of particles up to 25 nm in diameter (approx. 25 MDa). The first and best-characterized nuclear targeting signals are the conventional NLSs (nuclear localization sequences) that contain one or more clusters of basic amino acids [1]. The NLSs fall into two distinct classes: monopartite NLSs, containing a single cluster of basic amino acids, and bipartite NLSs, containing two basic clusters connected by spacers of variable length. Despite their variability, the conventional basic NLSs are recognized by the same receptor protein, termed importin or karyopherin, a heterodimer of  and  subunits (for recent reviews see [2­4]). Importin- (Imp) contains the NLS-binding site, and importin- (Imp) is responsible for the translocation of the importin­substrate complex through the nuclear pore complex. Once inside the nucleus, Imp binds to Ran-GTP (where Ran stands for Ras-related nuclear protein), which causes the dissociation of the import complex and the autoinhibition of Imp. The importin subunits return to the cytoplasm separately without the import complex. The directionality of the nuclear import is

conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDPbound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This distribution is, in turn, controlled by various Ran-binding regulatory proteins. Imp consists of two structural and functional domains: a short basic N-terminal IBB domain (Imp-binding domain) [5­7] and a large NLS-binding domain built of armadillo repeats (referred to as Arm repeats hereafter) [8]. The structural basis for the recognition of monopartite and bipartite NLSs by Imp has been studied crystallographically in yeast and mouse Imp proteins [9­11]. Monopartite NLSs bind at a major site located between the first and fourth Arm repeats, and additionally at a minor site spanning repeats 4­8. Bipartite NLSs span the two binding sites, each site recognizing one of the basic clusters [10,11]. The linker sequence between the two basic clusters makes few contacts with Imp, consistent with its tolerance to mutations. The structure of fl-Imp (full-length Imp), in the absence of Imp, indicated that the IBB domain occupies the major NLSbinding site of Imp, thus autoinhibiting Imp from NLS binding [12]. This is supported by studies indicating significantly higher NLS-binding affinity by Imp/Imp compared with Imp alone [13­22]. Several studies indicate that the affinity of the importin­ targeting sequence interaction is a critical parameter in determining transport efficiency [15,19,23,24].

the phosphorylation site do not make specific contacts with the receptor. The accompanying binding studies confirm that direct recognition of the phosphorylated residue by Imp is not responsible for enhancement of nuclear import. We conclude that the sequences flanking the basic clusters in NLSs play a crucial role in nuclear import by modulating the recognition of the NLS by Imp, but T-Ag phosphorylation enhances nuclear import by a mechanism that does not involve the direct interaction of the phosphorylated residue with the receptor.
EXPERIMENTAL Materials

* Single-letter amino acid code is used; residues with small letters indicate mutations destroying nuclear-targeting activity. Heterologous residues are present at the termini (see the Experimental section).  The CN and Cn peptides have been described previously [16].  Chemically pre-phosphorylated at Ser112 as described in the Experimental section.

Although one basic cluster may be sufficient for nuclear import, as demonstrated by monopartite NLSs, the multitude of bipartite NLSs suggests that it must be beneficial to contain additional interacting regions. Structural analyses of bipartite NLSs bound to Imp show that, whereas the essential contacts are provided by the two basic clusters, the linker sequences also contribute to binding [10,11,24a]. Similarly, the sequences flanking the basic cluster in monopartite NLSs contribute to the binding affinity [16,23,25]. Phosphorylation in the vicinity of the NLS also plays a role in regulating NLS-dependent nuclear protein import [24,26,27]. Phosphorylation events in various phosphorylation-regulated NLSs can have either an enhancing or an inhibitory effect on nuclear import. The best-characterized example is the NLS of T-Ag (simian-virus-40 large tumour antigen) that contains several phosphorylation sites N-terminal to the basic cluster (the basic cluster spans residues 127­131). Phosphorylation by the protein kinase CK2 at Ser111 /Ser112 accelerates the nuclear import rate 50-fold [16,28], whereas phosphorylation by the double-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinase at Ser120 further enhances import [23]. Protein kinase CK2 and double-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinase sites synergize both at the level of phosphorylation and enhancement of T-Ag nuclear import. On the basis of the available data, it has been proposed that the phosphorylated residues may be involved in a direct interaction with Imp [23]. A similar mechanism may operate in the Drosophila melanogaster transcription factor Dorsal, whose recognition by Imp/Imp is enhanced via phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at a site N-terminally flanking the basic cluster [18]. Phosphorylation plays a key regulatory role in most cellular processes, yet the consequences of phosphorylation have been structurally elucidated in very few systems [29]. In the present study, we investigated the role of flanking sequences and phosphorylation in the recognition of the T-Ag NLS by Imp. We co-crystallized a non-autoinhibited mouse Imp with both the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated versions of the peptide corresponding to the T-Ag NLS, G109 PGS112 DDEAAADAQHAAPPKKKRKVG133 (phosphorylation site is indicated in boldface; see Table 1 for the description of the peptides), and complemented the structural studies using ELISA-based binding assays. The structures show that the sequence N-terminally flanking the basic cluster makes several contacts with the receptor that are distinct from the interaction of bipartite NLSs with Imp [10,11]. Binding assays confirm the important role of this region in binding. Unexpectedly, the regions of the peptides containing

Dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Protected amino acid derivatives and p-alcoxybenzyl alcohol resins were obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA, U.S.A.). 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole, piperidine, PCl3, N,Ndiethylamine, t-butylperoxide, p-cresol and dimethyl sulphide were purchased from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Hydrogen fluoride was obtained from UCAR (Olen, Belgium).
Peptide synthesis

Non-phosphorylated T-Ag derivative peptides were synthesized using an ABI 433 A synthesizer [30,31]. Peptide PKKKRKV (N peptide; see Table 1 for the description of the peptides) corresponds to T-Ag residues 126­132, whereas peptide GPGSDDEAAADAQHAAPPKKKRKVG (referred to as CN peptide hereafter) corresponds to residues 110­132, additionally including the CK2 site (Ser112 ), with residue 111 replaced by glycine and residues 117, 120, 123 and 124 replaced by alanine (to remove all phosphorylation sites other than the CK2 site Ser112 , and thereby ensure that the chemical phosphorylation procedure was unique to the Ser112 position); N- and C-terminally flanking glycine residues are included. Substitution of Thr117 , Ser120 , Ser123 and Thr124 by alanine residues has no significant effect on importin recognition relative to the wild-type sequence [16]. Either of the residues 111 or 112 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2, but Ser112 is the preferred phosphorylation site [28]. The peptide GPGSDDEAAADAQHAAPPKTKRKVG (referred to as Cn peptide hereafter) is identical with the CN peptide, except that it contains Thr in place of Lys128 . The peptide GPGDDDEAAADAQHAAPPKTKRKVG (referred to as dCN peptide hereafter) is identical with the CN peptide, except that it contains Asp in place of Ser112 . The peptide CGRKKRKKTEEESPLKDKAKKSKGY (bipN1N2 peptide) contains Xenopus laevis chromatin assembly factor N1N2 (amino acids 535­555), encompassing the bipartite NLS with two heterologous residues at each terminus. The chemically phosphorylated peptide GPGpSDDEAAADAQHAAPPKKKRKVG (referred to as pCN peptide hereafter) was synthesized using the SPPS­Fmoc methodology (where SPPS stands for solid-phase peptide synthesis and Fmoc for fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl) [32]. Side-chain-protecting groups were as follows: Arg(Pmc), Glu(OBut), Asp(OBut), His(Trt) and Lys(Boc) (where Pmc stands for 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylcroman6-sulphonyl, OBut for t-butyl ester, Trt for trityl and Boc for t-butoxycarbonyl), with the alcoholic hydroxy groups of the serine residue unprotected. The peptides were prepared on alcoxybenzyl alcohol resin (0.6 mmol/g) using an ABI 433 A synthesizer and a modified synthesis method. Couplings were performed with diphenylcarbamoyl chloride, with the exception of Asn, Gln and

Arg, which were incorporated as their 1-hydroxybenzotriazole esters. Amino acid incorporation was monitored using the ninhydrin test. After the incorporation of the serine residue, these hydroxy groups were phosphitylated using di-t-butyl-N,Ndiethyl-phosphoramidite [33]. The di-t-butyl-N,N-diethylphosphoramidite was prepared from PCl3 , diethylamine and t-butanol [34]. After the oxidation of the phosphite into phosphate using t-butylperoxide, the elongation of the peptide chain was completed. The crude phosphopeptide detached from the resin using a TFA/dichloromethane/anisole mixture (31:15:4, by vol), at 0 C for 1 h, and the free peptides were precipitated with diethyl ether, filtered, dissolved in water and freeze-dried. The crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Lichrosorb RP-18 10 µm column (16 mm ×250 mm), using a Knauer HPLC apparatus (Knauer, Berlin, Germany), with the following solvent systems: A, 0.1 % TFA in water; B, 0.1 % TFA + 80 % AcN in water; gradient: 0­60 % B in 1.5 h at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Appropriate fractions were pooled and freeze-dried. Purity was assessed by analytical reversed-phase HPLC. The analytical HPLC investigations were performed on a Vydac C18 column (4 mm × 250 mm, 218TP54; Vydac, Hesperia, CA, U.S.A.), at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with detection at 220 nm wavelength and with the following solvent systems: A, 0.1 % TFA in water; B, 0.1 % TFA + 80 % AcN in water; gradient: 0­30 % B in 20 min. MS of the peptide was performed on a Finnigan TSQ 7000 tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source. The pCN peptide indicated a molecular mass of 2.5806 kDa, consistent with the theoretical value of 2.58078 kDa.

For crystallization, Imp(70­529) was concentrated to 18.8 mg/ ml using a Centricon-30 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.) and stored at - 20 C. Crystallization conditions were screened by altering systematically various parameters using the crystallization conditions for other peptide complexes [11] as a starting point. The crystals of both complexes (rod-shaped, 0.4 mm × 0.15 mm × 0.1 mm for the pCN peptide complex and 0.3 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.07 mm for the CN peptide complex) were obtained by co-crystallization, combining 1 µl of protein solution, 0.7 µl of peptide solution (1.7 mg/ml, with peptide/protein ratios of 3.5 and 2.5 for the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides respectively) and 1 µl of reservoir solution. The crystals were suspended in 0.5 ml of reservoir solution containing 0.7­ 0.8 M sodium citrate as the precipitant in 100 mM Hepes (pH range 6.0­6.5) containing 10 mM dithiothreitol.

and synchrotron radiation ( = 0.97 Å; 1 Å = 0.1 nm) at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Menlo Park, CA, U.S.A.). Data were autoindexed and processed with the HKL suite [36] (Table 2).
Structure determination and refinement

Crystals of native Imp(70­529) and the peptide complexes exhibit orthorhombic symmetry (space group P21 21 21 ; Table 2). Diffraction data were collected from single crystals transiently soaked in a solution corresponding to the reservoir solution but supplemented with 23 % (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen at 100 K in a stream of nitrogen (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, U.K.), using an MAR-Research image plate detector (plate diameter 345 mm)

Crystals of peptide complexes were highly isomorphic with the crystals of fl-Imp [12] and peptide complexes obtained previously [11]. Therefore the structure of mouse Imp [12] (Protein Data Bank entry 1IAL) with residues 44­54 omitted was used as a starting model for crystallographic refinement. Electron density maps were inspected for the presence of the peptide after rigid-body refinement using the program CNS [37] [pCN peptide­ Imp(70­529) complex, Rcryst = 32.3 %, Rfree = 32.4 %, 10­4 Å resolution; CN peptide­Imp(70­529) complex, Rcryst = 28.2 %, Rfree = 31.4 %, 10­4 Å resolution; see Table 2 for an explanation of R-factors]. Electron density maps calculated with coefficients 3|Fobs | - 2|Fcalc | and simulated annealing omit maps (Figure 1) calculated with analogous coefficients were generally used. The model was improved, as judged by the free R-factor [38], through rounds of crystallographic refinement (positional and

Solvent molecules were added using the program CNS [37]. Asn239 is an outlier in the Ramachandran plot, as also observed in all other structures of mouse Imp [11,12]. Pro242 is a cis-proline residue. The final models comprise 434 Imp residues (residues 64­497) and 20 peptide residues for the pCN peptide­Imp(70­529) complex, and 427 Imp residues (residues 70­496) and 19 peptide residues for the CN peptide­Imp(70­529) complex. Residues 64­69 of Imp in the pCN peptide­Imp(70­529) complex are part of the His tag and associated linker. The results of the structural determination are shown in Table 2. It should be noted that the crystals were grown in the presence of sodium citrate at high ionic strength, which may affect polar interactions between the peptides and Imp. The effect does not appear to be significant based on our binding studies and the similarity of the structures of NLS peptides bound to mouse and yeast Imp crystallized in different conditions [9­11]. The co-ordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (codes 1Q1S and 1Q1T for the pCN and CN peptide complexes respectively).

Structural analysis

The quality of the models was checked with the program PROCHECK [40]. The contacts were analysed with the program CONTACT, and the buried surface areas were calculated using the program CNS [37].
ELISA-based binding assay

Peptide binding by importin was quantified using an ELISAbased assay [16,23]. Peptides were coated on to microtitre plates and then incubated with increasing concentrations of Imp(70­ 529), fl-Imp or pre-formed fl-Imp/Imp heterodimer. Importin binding was then measured using a glutathione S-transferasespecific primary antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The colorimetric reaction after the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma) was followed at 405 nm for 90 min on a microtitre plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, U.S.A.). Values were corrected against background absorbance at 0 min and against wells incubated without importin. In some cases, peptides were coated in the presence of 0.8 M citrate (crystallization solution).

The NLS peptides were co-crystallized with the N-terminally truncated Imp [Imp(70­529)], which lacks residues 1­69 that are responsible for autoinhibition. The co-crystals with both peptides grew under similar conditions and isomorphic to other mouse Imp crystals [11,12]. Electron density maps based on the Imp model, following rigid-body refinement, clearly showed electron density corresponding to the peptides. The structures were refined at 2.3 and 2.5 Å resolution for the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptide complexes respectively (Table 2). Residues 119­133 and 123­133 of the pCN and CN peptides respectively could be interpreted unambiguously in the electron density map at the major site, and additionally residues 128­ 132 and 127­133 have been modelled for the minor site of the pCN and CN peptides respectively (Figure 1).

and asparagine residues at the 3rd and 4th turns respectively in H3 helices of the Arm repeats [10,11]. Residues 126­132 superimpose closely with the corresponding residues of the shorter T-Ag peptide (N peptide; residues 126­132; r.m.s. deviation of C atoms, 0.26 Å) [11]. Following the chain from Pro126 towards the N-terminus, the peptide turns initially in the same direction as for the peptide corresponding to the c-Myc NLS bound to yeast Imp [10], and continues further towards the edge of the groove defined by the N-terminal end of the H3 helices. The protein residues involved in the interaction with this region of the peptide come mainly from Arm repeats 5 and 6, with additional interactions of Imp Arg238 (Arm 4) with the peptide residue Pro125 and Imp Asn350 (Arm 7) with the peptide residue His122 . The peptide residues 119­122 interact exclusively with the sequence 305­308 at the N-terminal end of helix H3 of Arm 6. There are some close interactions with the protein formed at distances < 3.5 Å in this region of the peptide, with most of the interactions in this region being hydrophobic (Figure 4).
Recognition of the NLS by autoinhibited and non-autoinhibited forms of Imp is enhanced by the N-terminal flanking residues

Binding of NLS peptides to Imp

Imp(70­529) forms a single elongated domain built from ten Arm structural repeats, each containing three -helices (H1, H2 and H3) connected by loops (Figure 2). The structure of Imp is comparable with the crystal structures of fl-Imp [r.m.s. deviations of C atoms of residues 7­496 are 0.27 Å between the pCN and CN peptide­Imp(70­529) complexes, and 0.43 and 0.30 Å between fl-Imp and the pCN and CN peptide­Imp(70­529) complexes respectively]. Both the pCN and CN peptides bind at two sites on the surface of Imp(70­529) molecule (Figure 2). At the major site, the electron density is present for 15 peptide residues (residues 119­ 133; average B factor, 50.8 Å2 ) and 11 peptide residues (residues 123­133; average B factor, 36.6 Å2 ) of the pCN and CN peptides respectively (Figure 1) [the average B factor for Imp(70­529) is 37.9 and 37.4 Å2 for the pCN and CN peptide complexes respectively]. At the minor site, the electron density is present for five peptide residues (residues 128­132; average B factor, 72.3 Å2 ) and seven peptide residues (residues 127­133; average B factor, 60.7 Å2 ) for the pCN and CN peptides respectively (Figure 1). The parts of the pCN and CN peptides modelled in both complexes have similar structures. After the superposition of the equivalent C atoms of the pCN and CN peptides, the r.m.s. deviation of residues 123­133 at the major binding site was 0.91 Å, and that for residues 128­132 at the minor binding site was 0.36 Å (Figure 3). There is a surface area of 2014 Å2 buried between the pCN peptide and Imp(70­529) at the major site (239 contacts < 4 Å), and 1009 Å2 at the minor site (74 contacts < 4 Å). The corresponding numbers for the CN peptide are 1583 Å2 of surface area buried at the major site (171 contacts < 4 Å), and 1213 Å2 at the minor site (103 contacts < 4 Å). In both complexes, residues 125­131 at the major site have B factors below the average number for the entire structure, but the mobility starts increasing towards both termini. The general features of peptide binding are not different from those observed in other available structures of Imp­NLS peptide complexes [9­11]. As discussed previously [9­11], only the binding at the major site is likely to be physiologically relevant. The peptides bind in an extended conformation, with the chain running antiparallel to the direction of the Arm repeat superhelix. The base of the groove that contains the binding sites is formed mainly by the H3 helices of the Arm repeats, which carry some residues conserved among the repeats, including the tryptophan

To confirm the role of the flanking region, N-terminal to the basic cluster, in mediating the binding to Imp as indicated by the structural results, we used an ELISA-based binding assay to compare the T-Ag NLS peptide-binding properties of autoinhibited (fl-Imp) and non-autoinhibited Imp [Imp(70­529)] in the absence or presence of Imp (Figure 5A, Table 3). The binding to T-Ag NLS peptides with (CN peptide) and without (N peptide; Table 1) T-Ag residues 112­125 were compared directly. The CN peptide bound with approx. 4-fold higher affinity than peptide N to fl-Imp in either the presence or absence of Imp (Table 3, Figure 5A). For Imp(70­529), the longer peptide showed almost 2-fold higher binding affinity, whereas the maximal binding level (Bmax ) was approx. 5-fold higher. None of the importins recognized the derivative peptide with a mutation in the basic cluster (Cn peptide; Table 1) with high affinity, exhibiting 7­13-fold higher apparent dissociation constant (K d ) values when compared with the CN peptide and > 2-fold decrease in Bmax value. Using a peptide corresponding to the bipartite NLS from the phosphoprotein N1N2 (bipN1N2; Table 1), fl-Imp again exhibited the lowest binding affinity, with K d values at least 4-fold higher than those of Imp(70­529) or fl-Imp/Imp. Imp had no effect on the NLS-binding properties of Imp(70­ 529), consistent with its inability to bind Imp(70­529) which lacks the IBB domain. Our results show that the non-autoinhibited Imp(70­529) resembles fl-Imp/Imp in its NLS-binding properties, whereas fl-Imp shows decreased NLS-binding abilities consistent with its autoinhibited state [12]. The crystallization solution used for structure determination contained 0.8 M sodium citrate. To assess the possible effects of this solution on the recognition of NLSs by importin, we repeated the binding assays in the presence of 0.8 M citrate (Figure 5B, Table 3). For Imp(70­529) and fl-Imp/Imp, the presence of citrate resulted in a significant, but not dramatic, increase in K d values, and a decrease in Bmax values for binding to most of the peptides. One exception was the N-peptide­fl-Imp/ Imp combination, where the K d value decreased slightly in the presence of citrate. In contrast, the presence of citrate increased the NLS-binding abilities of fl-Imp, whereas the K d values decreased by approx. 2-fold. These results suggest that in the presence of citrate, fl-Imp exhibits NLS-binding properties more similar to those of Imp(70­529) and fl-Imp/Imp. Importantly, the binding properties are not altered dramatically by citrate, thus validating the conclusions drawn from the structural studies.

Phosphorylation does not enhance the recognition of the NLS by importin

To assess the effect of phosphorylation on the binding of T-Ag NLS peptides to Imp, we compared directly the binding of the phosphorylated pCN peptide and the non-phosphorylated CN peptide to the autoinhibited and non-autoinhibited forms of Imp

(Figure 5C, Table 3). Surprisingly, the pCN peptide bound with approx. 3­4-fold lower affinity to fl-Imp/Imp, Imp(70­529) and fl-Imp, and the Bmax value was decreased by approx. 20 %. We also performed analyses using the dCN peptide, which is identical with the CN peptide, except that it contains the negatively charged aspartate residue in place of Ser112 . This peptide was also less well recognized by importins than the CN peptide (Figure 5C,

present in the extended CN and pCN peptides are well ordered and clearly make contacts with Imp. This is consistent with the results of ELISA-based binding assays presented here (Table 3), indicating that Imp(70­529), fl-Imp and the Imp/Imp heterodimer all bind to the extended peptides corresponding to T-Ag residues 112­132 with higher affinity than to the N peptide, comprising only residues 126­132. Similarly, the binding of residues 111­132 of T-Ag fused to -galactosidase by Imp/Imp has been shown to be 10-fold higher than that of the fusion protein containing only the basic cluster (residues 126­ 132), whereas residues 120­132 showed 5-fold higher binding than the basic NLS cluster alone [16]. Clearly, the structural and binding affinity results suggest that the residues flanking the basic cluster play an important role in NLS recognition. Analogously, flanking sequences have been reported to be essential in other NLSs (e.g. DNA helicase Q1 [41,42]). Previous studies have shown that fl-Imp exhibits high affinity to NLSs only when bound to Imp [13­22]. Results of the present study (Figure 5, Table 3) show a higher affinity of T-Ag NLS peptides to the non-autoinhibited Imp when compared with the autoinhibited Imp, confirming that the NLS-binding properties of the non-autoinhibited Imp(70­529) closely resemble those of the Imp/Imp heterodimer. In conclusion, the structural and binding results presented here demonstrate that the residues flanking the basic cluster in a conventional basic monopartite NLS make a significant contribution to NLS recognition by Imp. The interaction of the T-Ag residues 119­125 with Imp is distinct from the interaction of the residues N-terminal to the Cterminal basic cluster in bipartite NLSs with the receptor. This sequence in the peptide corresponding to the bipartite NLS from nucleoplasmin binds along the major groove on the surface of Imp, where the binding sites for both basic clusters are located. In contrast, the N-terminal sequences of the CN and pCN peptides climb towards the side of the groove, interacting with a completely different set of Imp residues. There appears to be a plethora of possibilities in terms of surface features of Imp that the NLSs exploit for binding.

Structures of the complexes of peptides comprising the basic cluster of the T-Ag NLS, i.e. 125 SPKKKRKVE133 bound to the N-terminally truncated yeast Imp homologue, Kap50 [9], and 126 PKKKRKV132 bound to Imp(70­529) [11], have been reported previously. Whereas the binding of the basic cluster is essentially identical in the structures reported previously and in the structures presented here, several additional N-terminal residues

Previously, phosphorylation at the CK2 site has been shown to increase the affinity of binding of -galactosidase fusion proteins containing the T-Ag NLS to Imp/Imp complex by approx. 2-fold [16]. A 3-fold increase in binding was observed for a prephosphorylated fusion protein containing an inactivated T-Ag NLS, relative to the non-phosphorylated protein, implying that the phosphate may participate directly in binding to Imp [16]. Surprisingly, our structural analysis reveals no direct interaction of the phosphate group with Imp. One interesting observation is that despite increasing B factors, continuous electron density is present in the N-terminal region of the pCN peptide extending to the residue 119. In contrast, the electron density becomes discontinuous N-terminal to residue 123 in the CN peptide, and no clear electron density is present in the region 119­122 of this non-phosphorylated peptide. This is despite the fact that a higher concentration of the CN peptide compared with that of the pCN peptide was used in the cocrystallization experiments. Phosphorylation at residue 112 may therefore influence the conformational properties of the surrounding sequence, facilitating additional interactions in the region 119­122 of the peptide. Previously, the importance of conformation in this region of T-Ag has been suggested on the basis of the effect of proline substitutions in the region 109­111 [25]. However, our binding studies show a slightly lower affinity of the phosphorylated peptide to Imp. We conclude that the phosphate

group is not directly involved in binding to Imp, and that the observed increase in the efficiency of nuclear import cannot be explained by the increase in the affinity of the NLS to Imp, as hypothesized previously [23]. However, the observed increase in the binding of the phosphorylated T-Ag NLS­-galactosidase fusion protein to Imp/Imp heterodimer [16] suggests that phosphorylation may improve the presentation or accessibility of the NLS in the context of a larger protein, as would be the case in the native protein. Phosphorylation may also alter the kinetics of binding, decreasing the off-rate at the expense of decreasing the on-rate, without significantly affecting the equilibrium constant of binding. Such effects could be investigated in the future by binding assays capable of measuring the kinetic parameters (e.g. surface plasmon resonance biosensor). Furthermore, other mechanisms may contribute to the observed increase in the efficiency of nuclear import [16,28]. These may include the effects on the NLS release in the nucleus, interaction with NLS-masking factors or interactions with the nuclear pore during transport. An intriguing similarity exists between the effects of phosphorylation on the T-Ag NLS and the metabolic enzyme PAH (phenylalanine hydroxylase). The enzyme activity of PAH is stimulated by phenylalanine, and phosphorylation by cAMPdependent protein kinase at Ser16 further modulates the activity by decreasing the concentration of phenylalanine required for activation [43,44]. The crystal structures of PAH have been determined in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated states. The Nterminal 18-residue sequence containing the phosphorylation site contains no interpretable electron density in either form, and there are no major differences in the structures of the two forms [45]. For PAH, it is quite probable that phosphorylation only has a structural effect concurrently with regulatory phenylalanine binding. Examples of similar concerted action of regulatory events include the combination of cyclin binding and phosphorylation in cyclin-dependent protein kinase 2 [29,46] and dual phosphorylation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellularsignal-regulated kinase-2 [47]. Our results suggest that phosphorylation may act in concert with another regulatory mechanism during the nuclear import of T-Ag.
Conclusion

the T-Ag phosphorylation-regulated NLS provide new insights into the mechanism of regulation of nuclear import. Both structural and binding results demonstrate an important role of residues, N-terminal to the basic cluster in the T-Ag monopartite NLS, in the recognition by Imp. Surprisingly, the residue phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 is not involved in a specific interaction with Imp, consistent with the results from direct binding assays, indicating that phosphorylation does not increase the affinity of the T-Ag NLS to Imp. We conclude that the sequences flanking the basic clusters in NLSs play a crucial role in nuclear import by modulating the recognition of the NLS, whereas phosphorylation of T-Ag enhances nuclear import by a mechanism that does not appear to involve direct interaction of the phosphorylated residue with Imp.
