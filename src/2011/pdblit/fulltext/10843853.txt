The interaction between ecotin and target proteases with trypsin-like speci®city has been systematically dissected to understand the structural basis of ecotin's broad inhibitory speci®city and the role of the secondary binding site. Site-directed and region-speci®c mutagenesis were preformed at ecotin's primary site P1 residue (84), the C-terminal dimer interface (133 to 142), and two surface loops of the secondary binding site (67 to 70, 108 to 113). Substitutions at the P1 position resulted in less than ®vefold difference in the potency of ecotin binding to rat trypsin, suggesting that the extended binding site is important in binding. A ten amino acid C-terminal truncation variant showed threefold weaker selfassociation but remained a dimer. The interactions of the secondary binding site of ecotin with bovine trypsin, rat trypsin and human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) were investigated with alanine substitutions in ecotin at Trp67, Gly68, Tyr69, Asp70, Arg108, Asn110, Lys112 and Leu113, which formed contacts between the inhibitor and protease. By combining these mutations at the secondary binding site with mutations in the primary binding site the molecular recognition between ecotin and its target serine proteases was probed. The contrast in the Ki values of the various ecotin variants towards bovine trypsin, rat trypsin and human uPA established the role of ecotin's secondary binding site in recognizing these homologous serine proteases. Ecotin binds to proteases with a chymotrypsin fold through a combination of primary and secondary site surface loops and is amenable to redesign of its potency and speci®city for this class of enzymes.

Introduction
Serine protease inhibitors are one of the most diverse families of macromolecules that achieve similar biological functions with entirely different scaffolds.

protease inhibitors and their target enzymes make these inhibitors an excellent model system with which to investigate the fundamental biochemical and biophysical principles of protein± protein recognition. Serine protease inhibitors have been classi®ed into at least 20 subfamilies, based on amino acid sequence and mechanism of interaction (Laskowski & Kato, 1980). Four common reaction mechanisms have been postulated to describe the different chemical and kinetic pathways of the inhibition. The substrate-like standard mechanism accounts for the inhibition by a large number of canonical small macromolecular inhibitors with less than 200 amino acid residues. A classic example of this type of inhibition is that achieved by the binding of bovine pancreatic trypsin

946 inhibitor (BPTI) to trypsin. In this case, the P1{ residue of the inhibitor occupies the S1 binding pocket of the protease and the amino acid residues ¯anking P1 bind to the enzyme in a substrate-like conformation. Serpins, a family of serine protease inhibitors consisting of plasma proteins of more than 400 amino acid residues, inhibit their target enzymes through a loop insertion followed by a conformational change (Bode & Huber, 1992; Engh et al., 1995). In contrast, the other two serine protease inhibition mechanisms are more dependent on steric occlusion of the enzyme ± substrate binding pocket by the inhibitor. The non-speci®c ``molecular trap'' inhibition by a2-macroglobulin involves breaking a thiol ester bond and ``engulfment'' of the target protease (Barrett, 1981). Finally, the inhibition of thrombin by hirudin involves an extended binding site that bridges the active site nucleophile of the enzyme and blocks it from productive substrate binding. A common structural theme along these reaction mechanisms is that the protease and the inhibitor form a one-to-one complex. The majority of these inhibitors bind to the target protease at a single site. This binding site is usually well-de®ned structurally and con®ned to a speci®c surface of the inhibitor. In the case of substrate-like serine protease inhibitors, an extended surface loop of the inhibitor binds to the active site of the protease with a substrate-like conformation. This so-called ``reactive site loop'' provides all the binding interactions between the inhibitor and protease. The rest of the inhibitor plays the structural role of maintaining the proper conformation of the reactive site loop. Numerous studies have shown that, in many cases, the amino acid side-chain at the P1 position of this reactive site loop is the primary determinant of the inhibitory speci®city (Kossiakoff et al., 1993). Ecotin, a serine protease inhibitor found in the periplasm of Escherichia coli, is a noticeable exception to the examples outlined above. Ecotin is a competitive inhibitor that strongly inhibits trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, and many other serine proteases with comparable potencies (Chung et al., 1983). The inhibitor was puri®ed and its reactive site P1 residue was determined to be Met84, which lies within a disul®de-bonded protein segment (McGrath et al., 1991b). The gene encoding ecotin was cloned and expressed recombinantly in E. coli (McGrath et al., 1991a,b). The 142 amino acid residue monomer dimerizes in solution at submicromolar concentrations. The high-resolution crystal structure of ecotin complexed with rat anionic trypsin shows two ecotin

monomers forming a contralateral dimer through interactions at their C termini (McGrath et al., 1994) (Figure 1). Each ecotin monomer contains two tryptophan residues (Trp67 and Trp130) with Trp130 located near the dimer interface. The ¯uorescence of Trp130 is sensitive to the oligomerization state of the molecule and changes in its emission spectra are dependent upon the monomer ± dimer equilibrium. The ecotin dimer binds to two trypsin molecules at opposite ends of the dimer to form a heterotetramer with a 2-fold symmetry axis. The crystal structure also reveals a network of interactions between ecotin and trypsin with four ecotin surface loops in direct contact with trypsin. The interaction surface between the inhibitor and the protease consists of two distinct areas, each provided by one of the two ecotin molecules. The ®rst area, known as the ``primary binding site'', involves the reactive loop of ecotin, also referred to as the 80 s loop (residues 81 to 86) and the 50 s loop (residues 52 to 54). These two loops bind to the active site of trypsin. The second area, known as the ``secondÊ Ê ary binding site 25 A away (Æ3 to 5 A, depending upon the ligand), includes two surface loops of ecotin, the 60 s loop (residues 67 to 70) and the 100 s loop (residues 108 to 113) which bind to the C-terminal region of the protease (including part of the C-terminal helix and part of the 90 s loop of trypsin). The heterotetramer formed by two ecotin monomers and two trypsins is unique among the known structures of serine protease ± inhibitor complexes. From a mechanistic point of view, ecotin's mode of inhibition against its target protease shows novel characteristics in addition to a substrate-like mechanism. The interaction between the primary and binding site of ecotin and the active site of trypsin follows the classic model. The conformation of the 80 s loop is superimposable on that of the reactive site loop of BPTI and other canonical macromolecular inhibitors. However, the distinct secondary binding site observed in ecotin has not been observed in protease ± inhibitor complexes. The broad speci®city and dual binding mode of ecotin led us to investigate the binding interactions between ecotin and target proteases. Although the three-dimensional structure of the ecotin± trypsin complex provides insight into the mechanism of inhibition and details of the interface between the protease and its inhibitor, this structure does not offer critical functional information relating to the activity of ecotin. Therefore, the contribution of the various interactions of the protease ± inhibitor complex must be determined through other means. We have used a combination of site-directed and region-speci®c mutagenesis to address the relationship between the structure and function of this unique inhibitor and to ask how the inhibitor uses two distinct binding sites to recognize its target.

The high-resolution crystal structure of rat anionic trypsin± ecotin complex illustrates a network of interactions between ecotin ± ecotin monomers at the dimer interface between ecotin and trypsin at the primary binding site, and between ecotin and trypsin at the secondary binding site. These three areas are boxed and labeled. The two rat trypsin molecules are colored green and blue. One ecotin molecule is coloured yellow. The 80 s and 50 s loops of the yellow ecotin molecule are red. The 60 s and 100 s loops in the secondary binding site of the yellow ecotin molecule are shown in red and magenta, respectively. The side-chains of these 60 s (Q67, G68, Y69, D70) and 100 s (R108, Y109, N110, S111, K112, L113) loops are shown with key residues labeled. The other ecotin molecule is colored magenta. The 60 s and 100 s loops in the secondary site of the magenta ecotin molecule are shown in green. The 80 s loop and 50 s loops of the primary binding site of this molecule are shown in yellow and light blue. The side-chains of the magenta ecotin 80 s (V81, S82, T83, M94, M85) and 50 s (L52, H53, R54) loops are also shown with key residues labeled. The computer graphic model was generated using the program MidasPlus (Computer Graphics Laboratory, UCSF).

Results
Ecotin variants preparation and characterization In this study, ecotin variants with amino acid substitutions and deletions at the primary or secondary binding site were generated by sitedirected mutagenesis (Kunkel, 1985), expressed to high-levels in E. coli and subsequently puri®ed to homogeneity. The ®nal yield ranged from 20 to 100 mg protein per liter of liquid culture. The same expression system and puri®cation protocol using heat treatment and reverse phase HPLC steps were applied to both primary and secondary site ecotin variants. Activity assays were performed at each puri®cation step to monitor for activity loss of the samples. All variants were expressed in E. coli at comparable levels and were stable under the puri®cation conditions. Table 1 is a summary of the nomenclature of ecotin variants that appear in this study. The SDS-PAGE analysis of puri®ed aliquots of ecotin variants is shown in Figure 2. Ecotin WT and six variants at the P1 position and dimer inter-

face (WT, M84R, WTÁ, M84RÁ, M84 K, M84F, M84W) are shown in Figure 2(a), while Figure 2(b) shows ecotin WT and seven variants at the secondary site loop (WT, 60A4, 100A4, 60A4  100A4, M84R  60A4, M84R  100A4, 50A3  80A5, M84R  60A4  100A4). Each variant exhibited single-band homogeneity on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and migrated at the expected molecular mass. All variants cross-reacted with anti-ecotin polyclonal antibodies on immunoblots. Selected variants were analyzed with electrospray mass spectroscopy to con®rm their compositions. Ecotin variants 50A3  80A5, 60A4  100A4 and M84R  60A4 had a molecular mass of 15,713.40(Æ2.14) (calculated 15,714.15), 15,636.67(Æ3.22) (calculated 15,637.19), 15,886.95(Æ1.79) (calculated 15,887.27), respectively. The role of the primary binding site Since the P1 amino acid side-chain is often a major determinant of the inhibitory speci®city of many substrate-like serine protease inhibitors, the

role of Met84 of ecotin was explored by substituting this position with Arg, Lys, Phe and Trp. Met is not a common residue at P1 for serine protease inhibitors that target enzymes with Arg or Lys speci®city. For classic canonical inhibitors of trypsin, Arg and Lys are preferred at the P1 site, while both Phe and Trp are not well accommodated in the S1 pocket of trypsin. The inhibition constants (Ki) of ecotin P1 substitution variants against rat trypsin were measured and are listed in Table 2. Signi®cant changes of the electrostatic and hydrophobic properties of the P1 residue of ecotin had relatively little effect on inhibition of rat trypsin by these variants. Although the favorable substitutions M84R and M84 K had lower Ki values compared to that of WT ecotin, the magnitude of the change was only twofold. Similarly, ecotin variants with unfavorable mutations M84F and M84W were still potent inhibitors of rat trypsin with the greatest effect being ®vefold weaker association between rat trypsin and ecotin M84F compared to WT ecotin. The role of the C-terminal dimer interface The C-terminal dimer interface between the two ecotin monomers is a key structural element of the tetrameric complex. The dimer interface forms one of the three protein± protein interfaces in the tetramer, the other two contact regions being the primary and secondary binding sites that interact with the protease. The dimerization of ecotin not only dramatically increases the contact region between the inhibitor and the protease, but also adapts to maintain the proper orientation of the two ecotins as a molecular ``hinge'' to permit binding different proteases that have a chymotrypsinfold structure. The combined surface areas of the primary and secondary sites of ecotin that become Ê buried upon binding to trypsin exceed 2800 A2. This area is substantially greater than most of the other protease ± inhibitor interfaces (e.g. BPTI±trypÊ sin interface is 1390 A2). If the hinge region is disrupted or destroyed, the relative positions of the primary and secondary binding sites may change, since each binding site results from different surfaces of the two head-to-tail oriented ecotin mono-

mers (Figure 1). We investigated the role of the dimer interface on ecotin's unique broad speci®cities by truncating the C termini of the ecotin monomer. Residues 133 to 142, which consist of about one half of the contact amino acids of the C-terminal arm, were deleted while still maintaining a stub of two amino acids. The ecotin variants with residues 133 to 142 truncated was denoted ecotin WTÁ. The other variant with residues 133 to 142 truncated and the P1 Met at position 84 replaced with an Arg was denoted ecotin M84RÁ. These two variants were designed to probe the importance of the dimer interface under the context of ``neutral'' or favorable P1 interactions. The monomer ± dimer dissociation constant, Kd, was measured by moni-

Ecotin variants were puri®ed as described in detail in Materials and Methods. For each variant, the periplasmic fraction of one liter of ecotintransformed E. coli culture was dialyzed, acidi®ed, neutralized and then heated at 100 C. The sample was then dialyzed, concentrated, puri®ed with reverse phase HPLC, and lyophilized. One to two mg of puri®ed ecotin or ecotin variant was loaded in each lane of the SDS/ 15% polyacrylamide gel. Molecular mass markers are shown at the left in kDa. The variants migrated according to their calculated molecular masses and are homogenous bands.

toring the ¯uorescence of Trp130 located at the dimer interface (Seymour et al., 1994).The Kd values of ecotin WT and several truncation variants are shown in Table 3. The Kd of ecotin WT, 220(Æ130) nM, was in agreement with the value measured previously (Seymour et al., 1994). However, ecotin WTÁ and ecotin M84RÁ had Kd values only 2.5 and 3.7-fold higher, respectively. This suggested that the truncation variants of ecotin still formed dimer, even though their dimer interactions were weakened. Interestingly, replacement of Met at position 84 with an Arg also increased the Kd slightly relative to WT ecotin (1.7-fold). The subtle change at one surface loop is conveyed to the C terminus of the same molecule, implying that ecotin has extensive structural ¯exibility. To probe the inhibitory activities of the ecotin variants, three homologous serine proteases, bovine cationic trypsin, rat anionic trypsin and the catalytic domain of human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), were chosen as targets. These enzymes share the same three-dimensional fold and have very similar substrate binding pockets. However, trypsin and uPA have different catalytic ef®ciencies and in vivo physiological functions. Together, they form a sample set that represents the large family of serine proteases recognizing Arg/Lys at the P1 position. The Ki values of the ecotin C-terminal truncation variants against the three serine proteases are shown in Table 4. These data are also plotted in Figure 3 as Ki plots to illustrate the relative contributions from the P1 residue and the dimer interface. The juxtaposition of the Ki data of the same group of ecotin variants against the three serine proteases provides a clear and direct graphic comparison of the inhibitory activity of the ecotin variants under different circumstances. We used these Ki plots to visualize the distinct patterns of molecular recognition between the ecotin variants and their target proteases. One striking implication from the Ki measurements was that deletion of ten amino acid residues at the C terminus of ecotin has minimal impact on its structural integrity and that the effect of the deletion on its inhibition properties is unexpectedly protease dependent. This observation is seen in the presence of bovine trypsin where the C-terminal truncations in either ecotin WT or ecotin M84R had small effects on Ki, suggesting that the deletion did not destabilize the tetrameric complex. In contrast, the inhibition of rat trypsin by WTÁ was almost 200-fold weaker, indicating that the truncation could have dramatic consequences. This surprising result also

demonstrated that a change distal from the primary binding site of ecotin could affect inhibition. However, once the M84R substitution was introduced and combined with the C-terminal deletion, ecotin M84RÁ not only regained nanomolar potency against rat trypsin, but also became an even better inhibitor of this enzyme (90 pM versus 930 pM for WT). This result suggests that the favorable electrostatic interaction at the P1 position could compensate for the weakened interactions due to the C-terminal truncation. Finally, the Ki data of uPA inhibition revealed yet another pattern. In this case, the M84R substitution only partially compensated for the unfavorable interactions created by the Cterminal deletion. However, the Ki of the double variant, ecotin M84RÁ and uPA remained at micromolar levels (2.7 mM). In contrast to that of rat trypsin, the favorable electrostatic interaction at the P1 position alone was not suf®cient for tight binding with uPA. Overall, these results show that the inhibition of rat trypsin and uPA by ecotin is very sensitive to the perturbation of the dimer interface. However, the inhibition of bovine trypsin, an enzyme that has 74% sequence identity with rat trypsin, is insensitive to mutations at the P1 site and C-terminal region.

The standard deviations of the plotted Ki values are below 20%. For clarity the error ranges are not shown. For each target protease, a group of four Ki values of ecotin and ecotin variants are shown as a linked cluster. The Ki values of ecotin WT and the double variants against the target enzyme are shown at the left and right side of the cluster, respectively. The Ki values of the two single variants were plotted between the Ki values of ecotin WT and the double variants. The Ki sets against different target enzymes are shown side by side for comparison. The distinct patterns of these Ki plots highlight the differential impact of ecotin's primary and secondary binding sites against homologous serine proteases.

Region-specific mutagenesis at the primary and secondary binding sites Although investigations of the P1 site and dimer interface had revealed the importance of the secondary site, more direct evidence was necessary to establish its role in protease binding. A structurebased approach was adopted to dissect and isolate the relative contributions from ecotin's two binding sites. By examining the ecotin ±trypsin interface in the crystal structure of the tetrameric complex, a series of candidate residues was selected for investigation (Table 5). We focused on residues that are Ê within 4.2 A of a protease, have large buried Ê surface areas (over 50 A2) or large percentage change of buried surface area upon binding (over 50% buried), and residues with the right geometry and location for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. There residues could be divided into two distinct groups. The primary site group includes residues 81 to 86 and 52 to 54 located on two surface loops (50 s and 80 s loops). The secondary site group consists of residues 67 to 70, 108, 110, 112 and 113, also from two surface loops (60 s and 100 s loops). To investigate the roles of these residues in binding, they were substituted with alanine. Two multiple alanine substitution variants of ecotin were made, designated as ecotin 50A3  80A5 and ecotin 60A4  100A4. Ecotin 50A3  80A5 has eight alanine substitutions at residues 81 to 85 (residue 86 is already an alanine) and 52 to 54. Ecotin 60A4  100A4 also has eight alanine substitutions at residues 67 to 70, 108, 110, 112 and 113. Fluorescence titration experiments showed that these two multiple alanine substitution variants still dimerized, with a monomer ±dimer dissociation constant Kd of 370 nM and 600 nM for ecotin 50A3  80A5 and ecotin 60A4  100A4, respectively.

These two multiple alanine substitution variants were investigated further to de®ne the roles of the primary and secondary binding sites of ecotin. Their inhibition constants against bovine and rat trypsins are shown in Table 6. The Ki of ecotin 50A3  80A5 against rat trypsin increased 30,000-fold compared to that of ecotin WT, from 0.93 nM to 27.9 mM; its Ki against bovine trypsin also increased signi®cantly (about 300fold). These results con®rmed the essential role of the reactive site loop as a major determinant of the strength of protease inhibition. At the secondary binding site, the Ki of ecotin 60A4  100A4 for bovine trypsin increased slightly (about ®vefold) compared to that of ecotin WT. The potency of this variant demonstrated that ecotin remained competent as an inhibitor even after a signi®cant part of the molecule was replaced with alanine residues. Nevertheless, the inhibition towards rat trypsin by ecotin 60A4  100A4 decreased over 16,000-fold (15.3 mM), indicating that this loop contributes greatly to binding. Ecotin WT inhibits both rat and bovine trypsin equally well, but ecotin 60A4  100A4 has acquired near 10,000-fold greater potency for bovine trypsin (1.59 nM) over rat trypsin (15.3 mM). The dramatic contrast of the inhibition of ecotin 60A4  100A4 for bovine and rat trypsin highlighted the importance of the 60 s and 100 s loops

for different proteases. To ensure that the loss of inhibition was not due to its intrinsic destabilization, ecotin 60A4  100A4 was incubated at 37 C with rat and bovine trypsin at pH 5.2 and 8.0 for up to 16 hours at 1 to 600 enzyme:inhibitor concentration. The reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The inhibitor was stable to proteolysis for the length of time needed for the Ki measurement (20 minutes). However, partial proteolysis of ecotin was eventually seen by rat trypsin at the longer time points. Similarly, ecotin 50A3  80A5 (27.9 mM versus rat trypsin and 98.3 nM versus bovine trypsin) exhibits partial proteolysis by rat and bovine trypsin. Not surprisingly, ecotin WT is stable to proteolysis by both enzymes at both conditions. Therefore, the results of the over digestion assays are consistent with the results of the Ki measurements. The role of the 60 s loop and 100 s loop As shown for rat trypsin, the secondary binding site in ecotin plays a major role in the inhibition of particular serine proteases. The substitution of the eight residues in the 60 s and 100 s loops was suf®cient to weaken the binding interactions between ecotin and one target protease by at least four orders of magnitude. Since these residues are located at two discontinuous regions of the surface loops, their contributions can be further dissected and analyzed. Ecotin 60A4, ecotin M84R  60A4, ecotin 100A4, ecotin M84R  100A4 and ecotin M84R  60A4  100A4 were designed to address this question. Their Ki values against the three serine proteases are listed in Table 7 and are also plotted in Figure 4(a), (b) and (c) for ecotin variants with alanine mutations at the 60 s loop, the 100 s loop and both loops, respectively. Together with ecotin M84R and ecotin 60A4  100A4 these proteins formed a complete set of variants that allowed the separation and de®nition of the individual role of the 60 s and 100 s loops. Figure 4 provides an overview of the interactions among ecotin's two surface loops and various proteases. The Ki plots were used to evaluate either the impact of speci®c surface loops in different enzymes, or the inhibition of a particular enzyme by different variants. Similar to the results from the previous experiment, the inhibition of bovine trypsin by ecotin was not affected by drastic

changes to the inhibitor. The Ki values of all variants were approximately 1 nM. Ecotin 100A4 bound even slightly more tightly than ecotin M84R (40 pM versus 90 pM). Thus, the only dominant factor for bovine trypsin binding was the proper conformation of the primary site reactive loop. In the case of uPA inhibition it was clear that both the primary site (P1) and the two secondary site loops were critical for binding. The difference between the Ki values of the alanine substitutions and the Ki of ecotin WT against uPA were signi®cant, ranging from 75 mM to 576 mM. The three double variants that simultaneously carry a favorable M84R substitution and unfavorable multiple alanine substitutions failed to achieve the low nanomolar binding of ecotin M84R. Their Ki values

952 range from 1.5 to 28.2 mM, strongly suggesting that the proper amino acid sequences at the 60 s and 100 s loops were essential for optimal interaction between uPA and ecotin. The Ki plot of rat trypsin indicated yet another pattern of secondary site inhibition. In this case, the 60 s loop was responsible for providing most of the binding energy as indicated by the over 4000-fold increase of Ki with ecotin 60A4, while the effect of the 100 s loop was minimal. For all three enzymes, the 60 s loop played a more predominant role in determining the strength of the inhibition at the secondary site. It is signi®cant that the inhibition of each enzyme was achieved through the differential contributions from these two surface loops and that the contributions from these loops were dependent on the identity of the P1 residue and of the target enzyme. For example, if the target enzyme was rat trypsin, the favorable substitution M84R alone was suf®cient to compensate for the adverse effects of the alanine substitution at the secondary binding site. Thus, the 60 s loop was only important when P1 84 was a Met. However, the inhibition of uPA required not only a favorable P1 residue (Arg) at the 84 position, but also key residues at both the 60 s and 100 s loops. Non-additivity among ecotin variants The Ki data set of the three groups of ecotin variants allow us to analyze the interrelationships among the key determinants of ecotin's potency and speci®city. In particular, we determined whether the separate mutations are additive by comparing the Ki values of ecotin 60A4  100A4 versus those of ecotin 60A4 or ecotin 100A4 against one particular protease. In the case of rat trypsin inhibition, the ecotin variant with alanine substitutions at two loops bound more weakly than either of the two single alanine-substituted loop variants. For uPA binding, the 60 s loop had a more signi®cant effect. The Ki of ecotin 60A4 against uPA was even higher than the Ki of the double mutant ecotin 60A4  100A4. It is clear that the contributions of these two loops were not independent of each other. The Ki plot was effective in directly comparing the strength of inhibition by ecotin variants and

where ÁÁ is the ÁG difference between double eYf mutant A, B and the WT, and ÁÁ and ÁÁ are f e the differences between the single site variant A or B and the WT, respectively (Wells, 1990). By converting Ki to free energy using equation (3), the ÁG term for mutations at different sites of s ecotin can be calculated. Fifteen double mutation cycles were constructed from our original Ki data. These cycles were based on three different target proteases and between ecotin M84R and ecotin WTÁ, between ecotin M84R and ecotin 60A4, between ecotin M84R and ecotin 100A4, and between ecotin 60A4 and ecotin 100A4. The calculated ÁG values are listed in Table 8. Mutational s additivity has been seen in other model systems such as growth hormone and its receptor (Wells, 1996), as well as subtilisin (Wells et al., 1987) and the third domain of turkey ovomucoid (Lu et al., 1997; Qasim et al., 1997). In those cases, the interaction energy ÁG was shown to be small, usually s less than 0.4 kcal/mol. With ecotin, however, the ÁGI was larger. Half of the ecotin interaction energy values were greater than 1 kcal/mol. The non-additivity was most pronounced between ecotin M84R and ecotin 60A4 mutations when the target enzyme was rat trypsin. The ÁG for this s particular mutation cycle was 5.46 kcal/mol. The large interaction energy highlighted the dynamic linkage among the key structural and functional elements of ecotin. These data provide evidence for cooperative and synergistic interactions among the P1 residue of ecotin, the two surface loops and the dimer interface. It also suggests that the unique

953 uPA offered indirect evidence of the critical roles of the secondary site surface loops. Finally, the multiple alanine substitution experiments strongly support the notion that the 60 s and 100 s loops could provide the critical binding energy necessary for protease inhibition. The loss of function of the variants not only established the essential role of the secondary site in rat trypsin and uPA binding, but also revealed an interdependent relationship between the 60 s and 100 s loops, suggesting a dynamic nature of the secondary site interaction. The Ki plot of the 60 s loop variants was almost superimposable with that of the truncation variants. These two different large-scale modi®cations of ecotin have generated similar consequences in terms of the inhibitory activity. This in turn suggests a fundamental connection between the dimer interface and the secondary binding site, two regions structurally distant from each other. Monomer dimer equilibrium The interaction of the protease with the secondary site of ecotin requires the formation of a stable tetrameric complex. Although the Kd of ecotin's monomer ± dimer equilibrium is much higher than Ki values against most target proteases, the Kd of ecotin dimerization could be dramatically perturbed in the presence of proteases. Proteases may serve as templates to facilitate the dimerization of ecotin. If there are strong cooperative interactions upon the binding of the second inhibitor (I2) and the second enzyme molecule (E2), the reaction pathway may proceed from I 3 EI 3 EI2 3 E2I2, where the last two steps are rapid and drive the tetrameric complex formation to completion. Preliminary data from analytical centrifugation experiments show that trypsin monomer, ecotin dimer and ecotin ±trypsin heterotetramer are the only three coexisting homogeneous species in solution when a mixture of trypsin and ecotin is subjected to velocity sedimentation (M. Doyle, unpublished results). Recently, a C-terminal truncation ecotin variant was shown to be monomeric by gel ®ltration (Pal et al., 1996). This discrepancy with our results indicates that the solution state of ecotin truncation variants in the absence of protease may vary with buffer conditions and other variables. However, that study also showed that upon the addition of the protease, the tetrameric complex was formed. All the data in our study support the conclusion that the ecotin ±protease complex is tetrameric under a wide range of concentrations and that the secondary binding site has crucial roles in the formation and stabilization of the complex. Clearly the tetrameric nature of the ecotin ±protease complex makes the mechanism of ecotin inhibition complicated due to the multiple equilibria of the ecotin dimers and the two bound protease monomers. In general, all of these equilibria might be expected to be affected by mutations of the inhibitor ±protease interface. In addition, there is

¯exibility and adaptability of ecotin are the structural basis for the observed broad speci®city.

Discussion
Ecotin's secondary site as a key element in macromolecular recognition We have used several approaches to establish the role of the secondary site of ecotin in protease recognition and inhibition. The experimental results can be interpreted on the basis of the unique network of interactions between ecotin and its target protease. The impact of P1 substitutions in ecotin was very different from that of the same substitutions in canonical serine protease inhibitors such as BPTI or turkey ovomucoid third domain (Lu et al., 1997). For these familiar serine protease inhibitors, there is usually a 100 to 1000-fold difference in the Ki values against trypsin between variants carrying a positively charged and an uncharged apolar residue at the P1 position. However, the Ki of ecotin against rat trypsin was insensitive to alterations at this position. Other research groups have also obtained similar results using ecotin against other serine proteases (Pal et al., 1994; Seong et al., 1994; Seymour et al., 1994). These results demonstrate that the side-chain of the P1 residue does not play a predominant and independent role in determining the inhibitory speci®city of ecotin. The binding energy of ecotin must come from other parts of the molecular interface. Structural analysis of the trypsin ± ecotin complex suggests that a logical candidate is the secondary binding site which is composed of the two surface loops covering residues 67 to 70 and 108 to 113. These loops derive from the contralateral ecotin monomers in the tetramer with respect to the primary loops (Figure 1). The C-terminal truncation mutagenesis experiment, which affects the hinge between the ecotin monomer, highlighted the importance of the secondary site and its alignment. The differential inhibition of the three proteases by ecotin WTÁ was a novel characteristic of this inhibitor. A plausible explanation could be made based on two assumptions. First, the secondary binding site might play different roles in ecotin binding to different enzymes. Second, the perturbation of the dimer interface changed the positions and/or conformations of the secondary binding site relative to other parts of the molecule. Therefore, if rat trypsin (or uPA) required the secondary site for tight binding, and if the C-terminal truncation dislocated the secondary binding site, the interactions between ecotin WTÁ and rat trypsin (or uPA) would be severely weakened. In the network of interactions between the protease and ecotin, ecotin's C-terminal hinge region may affect the binding by modulating the relative contributions from the primary and secondary binding sites. The dramatic increase of Ki values of ecotin WTÁ against rat trypsin and

954 also the possibility of a folding-related destabilization for some of the variants, which would affect their potency of inhibition. Further studies are under way to address these issues. Protease inhibitors with multiple binding sites Ecotin offers a unique opportunity to study the complex network of interactions between serine proteases and bidentate macromolecular inhibitors. It is also an ideal scaffold on which to design and engineer protease inhibitors (Yang & Craik, 1998). Potency and speci®city toward target serine proteases may be introduced through the secondary binding site, a special structural feature of ecotin that does not resemble any previously known binding motifs within families of macromolecular serine protease inhibitors. Although Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI), which uses a substratelike competitive inhibition mechanism, forms a tetramer with subtilisin, each subtilisin is bound to one SSI in a ``chain-like'' con®guration (Takeuchi et al., 1991) that is as strong as the weakest link. In contrast, in the case of ecotin as shown in this study, each serine protease makes direct contacts with two ecotin monomers in a ``matrix'' con®guration that is stronger than the strongest link. There are other serine protease inhibitors with multiple binding sites for one protease molecule. Hirudin, rhodniin, and ornithodorin are three examples of bidentate inhibitors against thrombin (Rydel et al., 1990; van de Locht et al., 1995, 1996). These inhibitors bind to thrombin at both the active site and a highly charged exosite in a one-toone complex. Unlike the predominant electrostatic interaction between these three inhibitors and the thrombin exosite, the recognition between the secondary binding site of ecotin and its target protease is driven by a combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen-bind forces. Ecotin is also different from hirudin, rhodniin and ornithodorin because ecotin's two binding sites are provided by two monomers through dimerization. This unique bidentate binding mode has two advantages for macromolecular recognition for proteases with a chymotrypsin-fold structure. First, it creates a buried surface area that is nearly 50% larger than the hirudin/rhodniin/ornithodorin± thrombin interface, which is approximately Ê 1900 A2, allowing a large variety of interdependent factors to contribute to the formation of the ecotin ± protease complex. The macromolecular recognition is very sensitive to the speci®c residues located at the binding interface. Second, the tetrameric network interactions creates greater ¯exibility in modulating the strength of inhibition by introducing new controlling elements as the ``hinge'' region at the dimer interface. In this aspect, the ecotin± protease interaction is reminiscent of the antibody ±antigen interaction, in which the hyper-variable regions of the six CDR loops of immunoglobulin provide all the possible surface landscapes for recognizing any given antigen

through an enormous number of combinational side-chain conformations. Ecotin's four surface loops, the 50 s, 60 s, 80 s and 100 s loops, have great potential to be tailored to provide a complementary ®t with different protease surfaces that are in direct contact with both the primary and secondary binding site. The dramatic Ki differences between ecotin variants containing multiple alanine substitutions at the secondary site against bovine trypsin, rat trypsin, and uPA highlight the novel structural and functional features of ecotin. Rat and bovine trypsins are closely related enzymes with the same substrate speci®city and highly similar threedimensional structures. Although rat trypsin is anionic, while bovine trypsin is cationic, it is still not clear whether the electrostatic interaction is solely responsible for the selective inhibition of rat trypsin by the ecotin 60 s loop variants. Other structural factors may contribute to the binding energy of complex formation such as hydrophobic packing of the interface, or the ¯exibility and rigidity of the surface loops. For example, recent structural studies suggest that the relative position of the two ecotin monomers can shift upon binding to rat trypsin when binding determinants in the 60 s loop are removed (unpublished results). A systematic approach has been taken to investigate the dynamic relationships among the four major determinants of the interactions between ecotin and its target protease, the primary reactive site loop, the 60 s and 100 s loops, and the dimer interface at the C-terminal hinge region of ecotin. Our data suggest that the mutations at these four regions are non-additive. Furthermore, the importance of ecotin's unique secondary binding site in recognizing and differentiating between different target proteases had been ®rmly established. A comprehensive set of ecotin variants at the primary and secondary sites has been generated to probe the molecular recognition between ecotin and target serine proteases. Ecotin binds to proteases through distinct combinations of interactions between the primary and secondary site surface loops. The primary and secondary sites are adapted to the surface features by their intrinsic ¯exibility and by the C-terminal hinge, which permits relative adjustments between the primary and secondary sites. The discriminating power of the individual surface loops at the secondary site of ecotin suggests a novel opportunity to exploit the subtle differences among proteolytic enzymes with identical primary substrate speci®city and to design selective and potent macromolecular inhibitors against these enzymes.

Materials The E. coli strain JM101, XL-1 Blue FH and the VCSM13 helper phage were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The E. coli ecotin gene deletion strain IMÁecoJ was derived

Dual Binding Sites of Ecotin from JM101 and was a generous gift from Dr Iain Murray (I. Murray & C. S. Craik, unpublished results). Enzymes and reagents for the manipulation of DNA were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Low molecular mass uPA (LMuPA) was obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Bovine trypsin was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Rat trypsin was expressed in E. coli using the expression vector pZ3 and puri®ed as described (Higaki et al., 1989). Wild-type and variant forms of ecotin were produced in bacteria from the expression vector pTacTacEcotin following protocol described below. The chromogenic substrate Na-benzyloxy-carbonyl-L-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Z-GPRAMC) was purchased from Bachem Biosciences, Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). The chromogenic substrate Zg-Glu)a-t-butoxy)-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Spectrozyme UK) used for LMuPA kinetic analysis was from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). 4-Methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer (Foster City, CA) by using the phosphoramidite method and reagents from the same company. Synthetic oligonucleotides were puri®ed with NENSORB cartridge from DuPont NEN (Boston, MA). DNA sequencing was performed with a Sequenase 2.0 kit from U.S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). [a-35S]dATP was from DuPont NEN (Boston, MA). Geneclean1 was from Bio101, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Spectra/Por1 molecularporous dialysis membrane was from Spectrum (Laguna Hills, CA). Amicon Centriprep-10 and Centricon-10 were from Amicon (Beverly, MA). All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better and were used without further puri®cation. Computer modeling of ecotin Ecotin WTÁ (133 to 142): the ecotin ±ecotin interface was determined by using the program InsightII (Dayringer et al., 1986) to search for all ecotin residues in one Ê monomer that were within 4.2 A of the other monomer. Ê In the 2.4 A X-ray structure of ecotin bound to D102N trypsin (McGrath et al., 1994), the ecotin ± ecotin dimer Ê interface buries 3000 A2 of surface area as calculated Ê with the program Access using a 1.4 A probe size. In addition it makes ten monomer± monomer hydrogen bonds as calculated using InsightII with a distance cutÊ off of 3.0 A and an angle cut-off of 120 . Removal of resiÊ dues 133 to 142 was calculated to remove 2000 A2 buried surface area in the dimer interface leaving a possible Ê dimer interface of only 1000 A2 with only four of the ten original monomer± monomer hydrogen bonds. Ecotin 50A3  80A5 and ecotin 60A4  100A4: residues in the ecotin ± trypsin interface were determined from the Ê 2.4 A X-ray structure of ecotin ± trypsin D102N (McGrath et al., 1994) using InsightII by ®nding all residues from Ê one molecule within 4.2 A of the other molecule and vice versa. Area buried was computed according to the method of Lee & Richards (1971) as implemented by the proÊ gram Access using a probe size of 1.4 A. Candidate residues for mutation to alanine were all ecotin residues whose solvent-accessible surface decreased 50% or more upon binding to trypsin in either the primary binding site (ecotin 50A3  80A4) or the secondary binding site (ecotin 60A4  100A4) with the exception of Gly66, which had an unusual phi-psi angle such that its changing to another residue would destroy the secondary structure. This resulted in eight residues in the primary

955
site, which were changed to alanine. This group of residues is composed of Leu52, His53, Arg54, Val81, Ser82, Thr83, Met84, Met85 and Ala86 (left unchanged). The resulting construct was designated ecotin 50A3  80A5. In the secondary site residues Trp67, Gly68, Tyr69, Asp70, Arg108, Asn110, Lys112 and Leu113 were all substituted with alanine. This variant was referred to as ecotin 60A4  100A4. Ecotin mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel (1985). All mutations were con®rmed by DNA sequencing of the mutation region. Plasmids for the production of M84X (where X  R, K, F, W) The codon in plasmid pBS Ecotin that codes for Met 84 was changed to code for Arg84, Lys84, Phe84 or Trp84 by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides M84R, M84 K, M84F or M84W, respectively. The following is a list of these primers (underlined nucleotides were bases changed, italics codons were residues changed: primer M84R: 5H -GT TCC CCG GTT AGT ACT AGG ATG GCC TGC C-3H (with a unique ScaI site); primer M84 K: 5H -GT TCC CCG GTT AGT ACT AAG ATG GCC TGC C-3H ; primer M84F: 5H -GT TCC CCG GTT AGT ACT TTC ATG GCC TGC C-3H ; primer M84W: 5H GT TCC CCG GTT AGT ACT TGG ATG GCC TGC C-3H . Plasmids for the production of the C-terminal deletion variants WTÁ and M84RÁ pBS Ecotin and pBS Ecotin M84R were used as templates in a PCR reaction with oligonucleotides EcoN and EcoC to generate C-terminal variants at residues 133 to 142. The ampli®ed region was digested with BamHI and HindIII, puri®ed and ligated to the BamHI/HindIII fragment of pTacTacEcotin. The PCR conditions used were: 94 C for one minute, 40 C for two minutes, 72 C for three minutes, 35 cycles. The sequences of the two primers were: primer EcoN: 5H -AAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3H ; primer EcoC: 5H -TTGTCAATTTAAGCTTACGCCTTCCAGACGCGG-3H . Plasmids for the production of multiple alanine substitutions at the secondary binding site. The DNA in pBS Ecotin was changed to code for alanine at positions 52 to 54, 67 to 70, 81 to 85, 108, 110 and 112 to 113 by sitedirected mutagenesis using oligonucleotide 50A3, 60A4, 80A5 or 100A4, respectively. Each of these primers carries a unique restriction site, their sequences are as follows: primer 50A3: 5H -CTG GAA GTC GAT TGC AAT GCG GCT GCC TTG GGC GGG AAG CTG GAA AAC-3H (unique StyI site); primer 60A4: 5H -AAC AAA ACG CTG GAA GGG GCC GCC GCG GCC TAT TAT GTC TTT GAT AAA GTC-3H (unique S®I site); primer 80A5: 5H AAA GTC AGT TCC CCG GCT GCA GCG GCG GCG GCA TGC CCG GAT GGC AAG-3H (unique SphI site); primer 100A4: 5H -GC GAT GCT GGA ATG CTG GCT TAC GCT AGC GCG GCG CCG ATC GTG GTG TAT AC-3H (unique NheI site). The region in the vector containing the desired mutation was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated to the BamHI/HindIII fragment of expression vector pTacTacEcotin.

Expression and purification of recombinant ecotin IMÁecoJ cells were transformed with pTacTac Ecotin and transformants were selected by plating on LB/ampicillin plates. A single colony was used to inoculate 3 ml of LB containing 60 mg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were grown at 37 C for nine hours and diluted to one liter of LB/ampicillin. Following growth at 37 C for one hour, IPTG was added to the cultures to a ®nal concentration of 0.2 mM, and growth continued for 12 hours at 37 C. Cells were harvested and treated with lysozyme in a solution containing 25% sucrose/10 mM Tris (pH 8.0). The periplasmic fraction was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) with a Spectra/Por molecularporous dialysis membrane of 12 to 14 (Â103) molecular mass cut-off. Following dialysis, the supernatant was acidi®ed to pH 2.8 by addition of 1 M HCl to the sample. The sample was incubated on ice for 30 minutes and the acid-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was neutralized to pH 7.4 with 1 M Tris (pH 8.0), and adjusted to a NaCl concentration of 0.3 M. The solution was heated at 100 C for ten minutes, and then cooled to room temperature. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed against deionized distilled water overnight at 4 C. The ecotin sample was then concentrated with a 10,000 molecular mass cut-off concentrator (Amicon Centriprep10). The concentrated sample was loaded onto a Vydac C4 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography column (2.2 cm Â 25 cm) that had been equilibrated with 0.1% tri¯uoroacetic acid. The column was washed and ecotin was eluted with a linear gradient of 34% to 37% acetonitrile/0.1% tri¯uoroacetic acid at a ¯ow rate of 10 ml/min over 30 minutes. Fractions were analyzed individually by SDS-PAGE and those containing pure ecotin fractions were pooled, and lyophilized. Puri®ed ecotin was redissolved in water and stored at 4 C. The concentrations of ecotin and ecotin variants were determined using a calculated molar extinction coef®cient of 14,890 cmÀ1 MÀ1 for variants 60A4, M84R  60A4, 60A4  100A4, WTÁ, M84R; 21,860 cmÀ1 MÀ1 for wild-type (WT) and variants 100A4, M84R  100A4, M84R, M84 K and M84F; and 27,550 cmÀ1 MÀ1 for M84W. Determination of ecotin Ki values against various proteases Rat and bovine trypsin activity assays were carried out using the same substrate and procedure. Trypsin was titrated with 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate to obtain an accurate concentration of the enzyme's active sites. Various concentrations of ecotin or ecotin variants, were incubated with trypsin in a total volume of 990 ml of buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 10 mM CaCl2 (pH 8.0). Following a tenminute equilibration at room temperature, 10 ml of 2.5 mM Z-GPR-AMC substrate was added and at the rate of substrate hydrolysis was measured by monitoring the change of emission at 460 nm in a two-minute period at 25 C. LMuPA assays were performed as described (Wang et al., 1995). The assays were repeated ®ve to seven times under different inhibitor concentrations. All the data were ®t to the equation derived for kinetics of reversible tight-binding inhibitors (Morrison, 1969) by non-linear regression analysis using the program Kaleidagraph. The values for apparent Ki and true Ki, as well as the standard deviations of the Ki, were determined with the equation: Vi aV0  1 À

where Vi/V0 is the ratio of the inhibited rate versus the uninhibited rate, [E0] is the total enzyme concentration, [I0] is the total inhibitor concentration. Usually, the [E0] ranges from 50 pM to 500 pM for rat and bovine trypsin and 1 to 2 nM for LMuPA.
