SUMMARY Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is a developmental process induced as a response to nutritional stress. Activation of sporulation-specific gene transcription is under the control of the spoOA gene product. The Spo0A protein and the SpoOF protein are both homologous to response regulator proteins of two-component regulatory systems which control bacterial responses to a variety of environmental challenges. Response regulators are activated by specific ki, ases which phosphorylate them, In this study, it was shown that phosphorylation of Spo0A occurs via a phosphotransferase which is the product of the spoOB locus. The phosplhodonor in this reaction is the phosphorylated form of SPOOF. It is postulated that SpoOF acts as a secondary messenger that can be phospborylated by a variety of kinases depending on the particular environmental stress. The aeries of phosphate transfer reactions in this system is called a phosphorelay. The end product of this series of reactions is SpoOA ~ P which is shown to have greater affinity for the DNA target, the 0A box, of Spo0A on the abrB promoter than the unphosphowlated form. Spo0A, P, but not Spe0A, was shown to be an activator of transcription of the spotlA operon which codes for the sporulation-specific sigma factor e Thus, the initFation of sporulation is dependent on $po0A~ P which arises through the phosphorelay and which acts as a transcription factor tO repress certain genes, e,g, obrB, and activate others, e.g. spollA.

Introduction The formation of cndospores in Bacillus subtilis is a primitive developmental process triggered by adverse environmental conditions. Vegetative ceils of this microorganism possess regulatory mechanisms that allow the cell to sense the status of its environmeet and integrate this information into a decision whether to divide or initiate sporulation. The nature of the metabolic and environmental signals involved in this mechanism remains unknown. The genes in-

valved in signal production, signal processing or response have hee.n identified, in part, by isolating mutants blocked at the earliest stage of sporulati6n, smge 0 (Hoeh, 1976). The major loci ideal'fled as affecting the initiation of sporulation are listed in table ]. Sequencing of the spoOA (Ferrari et aL. 1985) and spoOF (Trach et aL, 1985) loci identified their protein products as members of the response regulator class of twocomponent regulatory systems encountered often in bacteria (Stock et al., 1990). Such systems are con-

trolled by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation using specific kinases (Ninfa and Magasanik, 1986). At least two kinases, KinA, the product of the spollJ locus (Antoniewski el aL, 1990) and KinB (Trach et aL, 1990), are involved in the phosphorylatioa of Spo0A and SpoOF. A sigma factor providing promoter specificity to RNA polymerase was found to be the product of the spoOHgene (Duhnau el aL, 1988). ThespoOKIocus encodes the oligopeptide permease operon, which has been postulated to he necessary for recycling of cell-wall peptides (Perego el aL, 1991 ), The spoOB and obg genes form an operon coding, respectively, for a protein of unknown fur~ction and a G protein capable of binding GTP (Truth and Hoch, 1989). The spoOE gene product is a negative regulalor of sporulation (Perego and Hoeh, 1991). Transcription during the early phases of development is controlled, in part, by the AbrB and Hpr repressors which prevent transcription of s~:afionary phase genes during vegetetive growth (Strauch et al., 1989b ; Perego and Hoch, 1988). Genetic studies of sofsuppressors (Kawamura and Satin, 1983) and their ide~'.tification as mutations within the spoOA gene implicated the Spo0A protein as the ultimate regulator of the initiation of sporulation (Hoch et al., 1985). SPO0A was known to be a DNA-binding protein which regolated abrB expression (Strauch el al,, 1990). It was unclear how the products of the other spoO genes functioned to regulate the aetion of the Spo0A protein. In this contribution, we present evidence tha~ Spo0A differs from

other response regulators of its type in that it has no specific direct kinase, but rather it is the substrate for a phosphotransferase encoded by the spoOB gene. The phosphodortor in this transfer is the phosphorylated form of SpoOF which is produced by kinase activity. This sequence of reactions is termed a phosphorelay, We also show ~hat the phosphorylated form of Spo0A is a positive activator of the transcription of the spo11A operon and has higher apparent affinity for its DNA target than the nnphosphorylated form.

Materials and methods

Stimulation ofspollA lranscription by phosphorylated SpoOA
Supercoiled pMW39, which contains the spollA promoter cloned into PKK2.32-8 (Brosius, 1984), was incubated (20 aM final concentration) with 120 nM core RNA polymerase, 1.6 ~M ~H and increasing concentrations of phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated Spo0A at 26°C. After 5 min, 2 ~.1of heparin (100 ~g/ml) were added, and the reaction was incubated another 5 rain before the addition of 2 ~1 of a nucleotide mix to allow elongation of transcripts. AFP, GTP and CTP were added to a final concentration of 400 i.tM, while UTF was added to 10 ~tM that included approximately 5 ~.Ci of a-)ZP-UTP (25 Ci/mmol, final specific activity). The transerip-

The elongation reaction was terminated after 5 rain with the addition of 5 al of gel loading buffer (8.0 M urea, 180 mM Ttizma base, 180 mM borate, 0.04 mM EDTA, 0.02 % bromophenyl blue and 0.02 % xylene cyanole). The RNA was separated on a 4 % polyaerylamide gel containing 7 M urea which was used to expose "Kodak X-OMAT" film overnight, Core RNA polymorose was isolated from B. subtilis holoenzyme (Dobinson and Spiegelraan, 1985) by phosphocellulose chromatography, g" was isotated as described below. Phosphorylation o f SpoOA The phosphorylation of the Spo0A protein by the KinA-Spo0F-Spo0B pathway was performed in a 40-~.1 reaction volume containing 125 ram Tris (pH 8.0), 125 mM KCI, 10 raM MgCI~, 1.25 mM CaCI~, 0.1 m M NazEDTA, 0.625 mM D T T , 25 gg/ral phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 °7a (vol/vol)glycerol, O.1 °To(wt/vol)gelatin, 2 ptM KinA protein, 20 ~zM SpoOF protein, 20 ~M Spo0B protein and varying amounts of Spo0A wotein (up to 20 ~tM). The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATE to 83 FM and incubated at 22°C for 90 rain. At the end of this time, indicated (see below) aliquots of these reactions were then used in the transcription or footprinting studies. In some cases, the phosphate32 transfer was monitored b~,"mcludmg50 ttCi y- P-ATP (6,000 Ci/mmole, ICN or NEN) in the initiation mix and the samples assayed on polyaerylamide gels, as previously described (Perego et aL, 1989). DNase I footprinting The DNA used was the 800-bp Hindlll-BamHl fragment of pJM5134 (Perego el aL, 1988) containing the abrB promoters, Spo0A-binding sites (Strauch e t a L , 1990) and upstream regions. The template strand, was 5" end-labelled via the action of T4 polynucleotide kinase (United States Biochemical Corp.) and y-]2P-ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol, ICN). Approximately 4 × 10 -9 moles of this DNA were used for footprintiag reaction, as described below. The labelled DNA was suspended in 5 Id of binding buffer (0.04 M Hopes, pH 8, 0.1 M KCI, 0.01 M MgCI 2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0. l mM DTT, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA) and prewarmed to 37 ° for I rain. At the end of this time, 10 ~1 of a Spu0A phosphorylation reaction (see above) were added and incubation con tinued for 5 min at 37°C. The amount of Spo0A in

these reactions was varied, and they were performed both with and without ATP. After 5 rain of binding, 1 ~tl of 0.04 mg/ml DNase 1 was added, and incubation continued for 5 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 ~1 stop solution (0.1 M Na z EDTA, 0.5 % SDS (sodium dodecyt satphate)) and 2 Fzl of 2 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. The DNA was precipitated with EtOH and the samples prepared and run on gels, as previously described (Strauch etal., 1989b).

Construction o f tt spo0H expression vector A 708-bp PCR (polymerase chain reaction) product containing the entire spoOtt-coding sequence but with modified trans,~atioual signals (see below) was ligated into tke Sinai site of pTT-7 (S. Tabor, personal communication). A plasmid (pMWIT) containing the spoOH gone in the proper orientation so as to place it under direct control of the TT-RNA polyraerase promoter was identified and shown to overproduce Spo0H protein in an Escherichia coil host when TT-RNA polymerase was provided by a superinfecting phage, MI3mGPI-2. Our modifications of the translational signals were performed by synthesizing an oligonucleotide primer designed to (1) change the initiator cndon from GTG to ATG, (2) change the ribosorae-binding site (RBS) to one known to function wet1 in E.

Expression and purification of SpoOH Cells containing plasmid pMWI7 were grown in 2 l 2XYT at 37~C until the OD 600 reached 1.0. The culture was then infected with M 13mGPI-2 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in the presence of 1 mM isopropyl thiogalaetoside (to induce T7-polymerase expression). Incubation was continued for 3 h at 37°C. The cells were harvested by cerarifugation, resuspeuded in ice-cold OH-buffer (25 mM Tris HCI, pH 8.0, 10 mM KCI, 0.1 mM MgCI~, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM [3-mercaptoethanot, 25 ~g/ml PMSF, and 100 p.g/ml lysozyme) ann sonicated until they were lysed. The lysate was spun at 18,000 rpm for I h at 4°C. The pellet (containing insoluble Spo0H protein) was then washed 3 times with cold OHbuffer and resuspended in 30 ml 2 070sodium deoxycholatc buffer. The mixture was rotated slowly at 4°C overnight and then centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C.

The supernatant {containing resolubilized SpoOH prmein) wa~ slowly diluted 1/10 wit h cold OH buffer and then loaded onto a 21.5 x'3 cm DEAE trisacryl M column (IBF-Biotechniques, France) prevloudy equilibrated with OH-buffer, The column was eluted stepwise using different concentrations of KCI (100, 300, 500, 750, 1,000 raM), The proteins in these fractions were checked by SOS-PAGE (polyacuclamide gel electrnphoresis). The fractions containing SpoOH were pooled and dialysed against OH buffer. Finally, the Spo0H protein was concentrated with "Centriprep-10" concentrators (Amieon), and glycerol was added to 20 % of the final concentration. The concentration of protein was checked with a "Bio-Rad" protein delerminafion kit and stored at - 70 °C.

Phosphorylation of SpoOA
Since the experiments of Ninfa and Magasanik (Ninfa and Magasanik, 1986), it has been clear thai phosphorylation was the mechanism of activation of response regulators in two-component systems. The veair~gproblem in sporalafio~ was the lack of kinase genes among the spoOgenes. A kinase identified as characterislic of two-component systems from homology alone was discovered during the sequencing o f the spollJ gene {Antoniewsk| et al., 1990). This kinase, KinA, was found to phosphorylate both Spo0A and SpoOF response regulators, but kinetic considerations dictated that SpoOF was the preferred suhstrate in vivo (Peregoet oL, 1989). Thus, SpoOA phosphorytation was either accomplished by a differ. eat kinase, or another protein was required to stimulate phosphorylation by KinA. In order to test this latter possibility, we purified the products of other genes involved in sporulalion initiation and tested whether they would stimulate KinA to phosphorylate SpoOA. Phosphorylation reactions were run with T-r~P-ATP and the protein components. The labelled proteins were separated on SDS-PAGI~ and the distribution of label determined by autoradiography. Figure 1 shows the results of phosphorylation reactions with K.inA. KinA autophosphorylates when incubated with ATP (lane l)aud transfers this label to, Spo0Fto produce SpoOF- P (lane 2). If the Spo0B protein was added to the reaction, it became heavily labelled {lane 3), and "~hisincorporation depended on the presence of SpoOF {data not shown). When SpoOA was added to a reaction containing KinA, SpoOF and Spo0B, Spo0A became labelled {lane 4). The incorpolalion of label into SpoOA required KiuA, SpoOF and SpoOB, and the phosphate group

The stability properties o f the phosphate on both SpoOF and Spo0A are those of an acid anhydride consistent with the location o f phosphate to aspartate residues in response regulators (Sanders et al., 19891. This predicts that asp54 o f SpoOF and asp56 of g p o 0 A are the locations o f the phosphates, From homology studies, the phosphoramidale produced by autophosphorylation of KinA is predicted to be located at residue his405. The phosphate of phosphorylated Spo0B has the stability properties o f a phosph6ramidate, suggesting a histidine location, although other residues are possible (Burbulys et al., 1991).

D N A binding by SpoOA ~ P Spo0A is known to be a DNA-binding protein with specificity for the sequence T G N C G A A , the " 0 A b o x " (Strauch et aL, 1990). Spo0A is a repressot o f the abrB gene, and its site o f binding to the abrB p r o m o t e r is located just downstream o f the transcription start site where a tandem pair or" 0A boxes is located (fig. 3).

SpoOA~ P produced a footprint idemical to that observed with Spo0A at a 20-50- fold lower concentration.

These results suggested that Spo0A was involved in the activation of $1oo11,4 transcription. Studies ofspoliA transerlption in vitro were an. dertaken using p~rified a H and core RNA polymeruse in the presence of SpoOA or Spo0A- P. These components and supercoiled plasmid containing the spolIA promoter were incubated together followed by a heparin challenge to ensure a single round of transcription. The labelled transerlpts produced were separated on SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography (fig. 5). Spo0A was unable to stimulate transcription over a 40-fold concentration range above the level observed without Spo0A. On the other band, Spo0A ~ P was an effective stimulator of transcription over the same concentration range. Thus,

Transcription activation by SpoOA - P
Tile eoutroI of the abrB gene by Spo0A is one of its critical roles since AbrB is a repressor of the onset of stationary phase in this organism (Strauch et aL, 1989b). However, it cannot be the only role of Spo0A since spoOA,abrB double mutants are still sporulatlon-defeetive (Trowsdale et aL, 1979). The identification of the 0A box allowed us to examine sequenced promoters of spo genes to determine if Spo0A might play a role in their control. One promoter of particular interest was the spallA promoter. Wu et aL (t989) showed that the transcriplien c ~ this nperon was dependent on the spoOA, spo~: ,id spoOF loci, i.e, the phosphnrelay, and on a ~lgma factor ended by the spoOHgene. In further studies, Wu el aL (1991) found that deletions from upstream to - 64 abolished promoter activity. Footprinting studies revealed that SpoOA bound to

even though SPOOA binds to the apoliA promoter, it is unable to stimulate transcription unless phosphoryluted.

specific for the various envlronmental challenges function to phosphorYlat¢ SpoOF as well. This is certainly testable, both genetically and blochemically. Ultimately, the concentration of SpoOA~ P must reach a certain level to trigger sporulation, regardless of the source of phosphate molecules. Spo0A ~ P levels are influenced by a variety of factors, the level of kinase activity on SpoOF being of primary importance. We do not know if the kinases that function with SpoOF can also act as phospharases of SpoOF- P, as is typical of two-component systems (Stock etal., 1990). Genetic evidence strongly suggests that the product of thespoOEgene is a negative regulator of flux through the phosphorelay (Porego and Hoch, 1991b). Perhaps it actsas phosphatase of SpoOF - P or even SpoOA- P or acts to stimulate the phosphatase activity of one of the kinases in a manner similar to the PII protein in the nitrogen regulatory system (Magasanik, 1988). The key enzyme of the phosphorelay is SpooB. which is a phosphntraasferas¢ linking the phosphorylation of SpoOF to SpoOA. SpoOB acts as an integration mechanism to direct the phosphorylation to SpooA. We postulate that SpoOB is a central control point for regulating flux through the phosphorelay. The genes for Spo0B and Obg, a GTP-binding protein, comprise an operon (Truth and Hoch, 1989). Obg is an essential protein for grow(h and also has GTPase activity, like other G proteins (Fogher and Hoch, unpublished data). We postulate that Ohg connects the phosphorelay to the ceil cycle, perhaps by controlling the activity of Spo0B. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on the studies of the relationship between DNA synthesis and sporulation by Mandelstam and Higgs 0974). These investigators found that sporulation could be induced only during a short window in the DNA synthesis cycle, and if the window was missed, the cell was committed to cell division. Inducing sporulation after the window is missed may be seriously detrimental to the growth of the cell and the timing of macromolecular syntheses. Thus, controlling SpoOB to function only during the window may be a mechanism to insure coordination of environmental and cell cycle events. It should be noted that this is a highly speculative interpretation of the results. It is equally possible that 5po0B r~gulates some function of Obg, or they have nothing in common except juxtaposition of thezr genes and a common promoter. Controls of the flow of phosphate to SpooA are certainly of paramount importance in coordinating the developmental process. Repression of the synthesis of components o f the phosphorelay, i.e., SpoOF and, to some extent, Spo0A, is known to occur in cultural conditions conducive to good growth (Yamashita eral.. 1986). Glucose represses SpooA expression (Yamashita etaL, 1989), perhaps through a mediator analogous to the CRP protein (Weickert

The initiation of sporulation is controlled by the Spo0A protein which exists in two forms, active and inactive (Hoch etal., 1985), corresponding to the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states, respectively. T h e p h o s p h o r y l a t e d form of Spo0A results from a series of reactions, which we have termed a phosphorelay. Stimulation of a kinase acting on SpoOF to form Spo0F- P is the initial event in the phosphorelay. There exist at least two major kinases carrying out this reaction, KinA (Amouiewski etaL, 1990; Perego et at.. 1989) and KinB (Trach and Hoch, unpublished data). Another kinase gone has been implicated in the reaction in the absence of KinA (Weinrauch etaL, 1990). We postulated previously that sporulation is under the control of a "cumulative environscnsory mechanism", which means that many different environmental and metabolic signals contribute to the decision to sporulate (Truth etaL, 1990). Until now, it was unclear how this might be accomplished. Knowing the series of reactions in the phosphorday, we now believe that SpoOF serves the role o f a secondary messenger, sensing the overall state of the environment by accepting phosphate from several kinases (fig. 6). This allows a variety of different adverse conditions, e.g., nitrogen, carbon or phosphate starvation, to induce sporulation. The assumption in this hypothesis is that the kinases

to be the most important (Wu etak, 1991). Despite the fact that Spo0A binds to the promoter in vilro, it is ineffectual as an activator unless phosphorylated. This may explain why spoOB or spoOF mutants do not show spollA expression even though Spo0A is not affected except through lack of phosphorylatlon (Wu et al., 1991). The spollA operon codes for a sigma factor {Fort and Plggot, 1984; Stragier, 1986) whose activity is implicated in the regulation of a forespore-specific sigma factor (Sun et aL, 1991). Thus, activation of its synthesis may indicate a serious commitment on the part of the cell to sporulate. It appears that the entire period from the end of exponential growth 1o the induction of sporulation, the transition state, is controlled by Spo0A. Since, under moderately adverse conditions cells are though: r.o maintain themselves, growing slowly, in this state, there must be a gradation of effects of Spo0/~.- P. Perhaps repression of abrB, which is required to allow expression of many genes during this period, is more sensitive 1o $ p o 0 A - P concentration than activation of spollA. It seems possib]e that promoters activated by Spo0A- P require a much higher concentration o f Spo0A~ P to be activated than is required for repression by this protein, The possibility also exists that factors in addition to SpoOA~ P contribute to the activation of such promoters.

and Chambliss, 1990). Thus, the formation of Spo0A~ P and its developmental consequences are avoided during conditions of nutritional excess. Spo0A is a DNA-binding protein which regulates the abrB gene by acting as a repressor (Strauch et al., 1990l. We found that Spo0A~ P had an apparent higher affinity for the Spo0A-bindlng site on the abrB promoter than unphosphorylated Spo0A. This resull, along with previous genetic studies (Zuber and Losick, 1987; Perego el al., t988), suggests that the actual repressor of abrB in vivo is Spo0A~ P. The AbrB protein is a veFy important participant in the regulatory scheme controlling the onset of stationary phase and sporularion (fig. 7). AbrB is a new type of regulator that controls many genes whose functions are not required during conditions of nutrient excess. The expression of such genes is normally observed to occur in culture at the end of exponential growth. AbrB acts as a "fail-safe" mechanism to keep these genes repressed. In most cases, it is not the controlling element for the genes it affects, but, rather, it is a "preventer" of gene expression even if the controlling elemcnt wishes to turn on the gene. The level of AbrB within the vege'~ative cell is maintained by auloregulation (Strauch et al., 1999a). "[he binding studies implicate phosphorylated Spo0A as a more effective repressor of abrB expression, and, therefore, it is responsible for the earliest events in stationary phase and sporalation, SpoOA ~ P was found to be a required activator for the transcription of the spollA operon in vitro. These studies explained the dependence ofspollA expression on spo0 genes (Wu el al., 1989) and revealed the other role of Spo0A - P as a positive activator o f stage II genes. Transcription of spoIIA was dependent on r t as predicted (Wu et aL, 1991). The upstream region of the ~poHA promoter contains many sequences with partial homology to the 0A box, and the footprint of Spo0A on this region covers a large area o f over 80 bp (fig. 3). The perfect consensus 0A box starting at - 6 5 appears from deletion studies
