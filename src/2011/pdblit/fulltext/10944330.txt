Structure of the Fab fragment from F124, a monoclonal antibody specific for hepatitis B surface antigen
The crystal structure of the Fab fragment from the monoclonal anti-preS2 antibody F124 (IgG1, ) has been solved by Ê molecular replacement and re®ned at 3.0 A resolution. The Fab crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. F124 recognizes an epitope contained within the preS2 segment between residues 120 and 132 of the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus. The antibody shows a high af®nity for the glycan N-linked to Asn123, but it also crossreacts with the non-glycosylated peptide fragment 120±132. Although crystallization was performed in the presence of an eightfold excess of the cross-reactive peptide, no evidence for the ligand was found in the antigen-binding site, which is close to a neighbouring molecule in the crystal lattice. The antigenbinding site has a groove-like topology which is modulated with pocket-like cavities. It is characterized by a large number of tyrosine and aspartate residues. The importance of germline mutations at the binding site is discussed.

1. Introduction
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), comprising three distinct membrane-bound glycoproteins embedded in the external lipid envelope of hepatitis B virus (HBV), is highly immunogenic and can induce neutralizing antibodies (Ganem, 1996). Indeed, anti-HBsAg antibodies form the major component of the early humoral response to HBV (Neurath & Kent, 1988). The three proteins of HBsAg, designated S, M and L, are translated from different initiation sites within the same open reading frame of the viral genome. Thus, the proteins M and L share the same sequence as S (226 residues) in their C-terminal regions. The protein M, however, carries an additional 55 amino-acid segment, referred to as preS2 (conventional residue numbering 120±174), positioned N-terminal to the S sequence. The protein L in turn carries the preS1 segment of 108 or 119 residues, depending on viral subtype, in a position N-terminal to the M sequence. Although the three-dimensional structure of HBsAg is not known, the structure of the preS2 peptide segment 132±145 has been determined in recombinant forms of maltose-binding protein where this sequence was inserted at different permissive sites of the host protein (Saul et al., 1997, 1998). The anti-HBsAg monoclonal antibody F124 (isotype IgG1, ), speci®c for the preS2 region of HBsAg, was obtained by immunizing mice with HBV particles of the ay subtype which were puri®ed from a chronic carrier (Budkowska et al., 1986). Binding of F124 to the preS2 peptide 120±145 is not compromised by the presence of F376, a monoclonal antibody speci®c for the region 132±145, suggesting that the epitope

recognized by F124 is localized on the N-terminal region of preS2 (Budkowska et al., 1987). Consistent with this observation, the epitope appears to include residue 126 of the preS2 region, as F124 has a lower af®nity for the peptide 120±153 from the adw2 serotype (Ala126) compared with the corresponding peptide of the ayw serotype (Thr126; Budkowska et al., 1987). The epitope also includes the glycan N-linked to Asn123, as F124 has a signi®cantly reduced af®nity for subviral particles carrying S and M proteins after deglycosylation (Budkowska et al., 1995). Thus, while the epitope recognized by F124 appears to be dominated by the carbohydrate component, cross-reactivity with the speci®c preS2 peptide 120±132 suggests that it also includes a region of polypeptide on the glycoprotein. In continuation of our study on the antigenic recognition by F124 (Passa®ume et al., 1998), we report here the crystal structure of the Fab fragment derived from this monoclonal antibody.

addition of increasing concentrations of phosphate buffer to the column, Fab F124 was eluted at the 100 mM step. The Fab fragment was separated from the uncleaved IgG by gel®ltration chromatography (TSK G2000 SW, TosoHaas) and from another protein fragment (recognized by anti-Fc antibody) using an NaCl gradient in Tris buffer pH 8 on a Mono Q column.

2.2. Crystallization

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation and purification of Fab F124

The immunoglobulin was puri®ed from ascitic ¯uid collected from BALB/c mice by precipitation with 40% ammonium sulfate followed by ion-exchange chromatography using a linear 0±500 mM NaCl gradient in Tris buffer pH 8.0 on a Mono Q column (Pharmacia). Two peaks corresponding to immunoglobulin were obtained, both of which showed identical recognition for recombinant particles bearing the preS and S domains (Michel et al., 1984). The larger of these peaks was chosen for Fab preparation. F124 fractions were pooled and dialysed across a Microsep 10K (Filtron) against 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 7.2. After the addition of mercaptoethanol and EDTA to ®nal concentrations of 14 and 12 mM, respectively, the protein solution was treated with papain (Boehringer) at an enzyme: substrate ratio of 1:50 for 2 h at 310 K. After incubating for 30 min at room temperature with 20 mM iodoacetamide, the buffer was changed to 0.02 M potassium phosphate pH 7.8. The protein was then applied to a DEAE±Sephacel (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with the same buffer. Upon

In an attempt to form a complex between F124 and the peptide preS2(120±132), the ligand was added in an eightfold excess of concentration over that of the Fab and left to equilibrate for 5 h at 310 K. 2.5 ml protein solution was then mixed with 1 ml buffer containing 2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.6 and 5% PEG 400 (®nal protein concentration of 3.4 mg mlÀ1). The resulting drop was sealed over a reservoir containing 1 ml of buffer in order to allow crystals to grow by vapour diffusion. Crystals took several months to appear and invariably grew in clusters from which it was dif®cult to separate monocrystalline fragments for diffraction measurements.

2.3. Data collection and processing

X-ray diffraction data were collected on a MAR345 imaging-plate detector system at the synchrotron beamline DW32, LURE (Orsay, France). Measurements were made with a single crystal of dimensions 0.2 Â 0.1 Â 0.03 mm at Ê ambient temperature using an X-ray wavelength of 0.9607 A. The crystal-to-detector distance was 250 mm and the active detector diameter was set to 180 mm. A total rotation range of 92 was covered in 1 steps, with each image being exposed for 300 s. Bragg intensities between the resolution limits of 30.0 Ê and 3.0 A were integrated and equivalent re¯ections were merged with the programs HKL and SCALEPACK, respectively (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Details of the crystal parameters and data-processing statistics are given in Table 1.

removed. Electron-density maps with Fourier coef®cients (2Fobs À Fcalc, calc) and (Fobs À Fcalc, calc) were used to build the CDR and to manually adjust the atomic positions in other regions. Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were imposed on all atoms of the V and C dimers of the two crystallographically independent molecules. Weights for the positional NCS restraints were chosen to minimize the Rfree factor. Map inspection and model building were carried out using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). Re®nement statistics are shown in Table 3.

2.4. Molecular replacement

A preliminary model for the crystal structure of Fab 124 was obtained by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The variable domain (including hypervariable regions) and constant domain dimers from the anti-digoxin antibody 26-10 (Jeffrey et al., 1993; PDB entry 1igi) were used as independent search models in the rotation and translation functions. The rotation function gave clear indications for the orientation for the variable (V) and constant (C) dimers of the two independent molecules expected in the asymmetric unit. These orientations were used in turn for the translation function, in which the correct solution proved to be the highest peak in each case. Multibody translation functions were then calculated to con®rm the consistency of the independent solutions for the variable and constant dimers and to place these four components on a common crystallographic origin. Rigid-body re®nement was subsequently performed to optimize the orientation and position of each independent dimer. The ®nal model had structurally sensible pairings of the variable and constant dimers with no steric obstruction to the packing of the two independent Fab molecules in the unit cell, thus con®rming the correctness of the solution. The two molecules are related by a non-crystallographic twofold axis which is approximately perpendicular to the bc crystal plane. Details of the molecularreplacement calculations are given in Table 2.
2.5. Refinement

Residue numbering and de®nitions of the CDR follow the conventions of Kabat et al. (1991). Residue numbers are preceded by L or H for the light and heavy chains, respectively. The Ramachandran plot is shown in Fig. 1. Electron density corresponding to the variable domains was continuous and well de®ned except for heavy-chain residues at positions 41 and 42. Certain regions within the constant domains had density that was too weak to reliably trace the polypeptide chain and were not included in the ®nal model. These regions are residues 199±202 and beyond residue 212 in the C domain and residues 128±136 and beyond residue 227 in the CH1 domain. The structures of CDR-L1 and CDR-H3 are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively, superimposed on the electron density. Although the Fab was crystallized in the presence of the preS2(120±132) peptide in an eightfold excess over the Fab

Re®nement was carried out with the program X-PLOR È (Brunger et al., 1987), with the geometrical parameters restrained to those proposed by Engh & Huber (1991). 95% of Ê the data in the resolution range 30±3.0 A was used to re®ne the structure, while the remaining 5% was used to check the È course of re®nement by calculating Rfree (Brunger, 1992). Bulk-solvent corrections were applied according to the È procedure described by Jiang & Brunger (1994). Individual temperature factors were restrained to target values by a 1.5 r.m.s. deviation for main-chain atoms and a 2.0 r.m.s. deviation for side chains. The initial model for re®nement was the molecular-replacement solution based on the Fab 26-10 structure with complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)

(see x2.2), no clear evidence for ligand could be found in the ®nal electron-density maps in the vicinity of the antigenbinding site. Indeed, the close approach of the hypervariable regions (CDR-L1, CDR-L3, CDR-H1 and CDR-H2) of the two independent Fab molecules, shown in Table 4, precludes the presence of bound peptide at the antigen-binding site. These contacts re¯ect the non-crystallographic twofold symmetry relating the two molecules in the asymmetric unit to each other. The buried surface at the antigen-binding site is Ê 385 A2, a value less than that observed for antibody±protein or antibody±peptide complexes (Stan®eld & Wilson, 1995; Davies & Cohen, 1996). There is no evidence suggesting that signi®cant dimerization of Fab fragments occurs in solution, as only a single peak was observed during puri®cation by gel ®ltration. Non-crystallographic symmetry was imposed on the VL/VH and CL/CH dimers of the two independent molecules during Ê re®nement (see x2.5), giving an r.m.s. difference of 0.24 A for all restrained atoms. The elbow angle of Fab F124, de®ned by the angle subtended by the pseudo-dyads relating VL to VH and CL to CH, respectively, is 155 in both molecules. Packing of the molecules in the unit cell is shown in Fig. 3. A comparison of the VH domain of F124 with other immunoglobulin structures in the Protein Data Bank showed highest sequence and structural similarity with the anti-GD2 ganglioside Fab ME36.1 (Pichla et al., 1997; PDB entry 1psk). Although encoded by different D and JH genes, they have 94 of 119 residues identical (79%) and an r.m.s. Ê difference of 1.33 A between the C positions. For the region encoded by the VH gene only (residues 1±94, which excludes Ê CDR-H3) the r.m.s. difference is 0.74 A. The VL domain in turn shows highest sequence and structural similarity to the anti-HIV gp120 peptide antibody 58.2 (Stan®eld et al., 1999; PDB entry 3f58): 96 identical residues Ê of 111 (86%) and 0.44 A r.m.s. difference  between their C positions.

Figure 2

The nucleotide sequence of the genes coding for the VH and VL domains has been determined from cDNA that was synthesized from the mRNA isolated from F124secreting hybridomas (Passa®ume et al., 1998). Sequence analysis showed that the VL-coding region was derived from the V 21 germ-line gene and the J 4 segment. Six nucleotide changes with respect to V 21 are present (97.9% identity), but none in the region encoded by J 4. Two of these mutations are silent, while the four remaining changes lead to the amino-acid substitutions IleL23Met in the ®rst framework region (FR1), AlaL503Val and GluL553Lys in CDR-L2 and ArgL903Gln in CDR-L3.

M104E is a monoclonal antibody and thus is a product of somatic rearrangement and potential somatic hypermutation, its pattern of VH-nucleotide differences with F124 and other closely related sequences found in the database search suggests that it is very close if not identical to a germ-line sequence. This assumption would seem reasonable as M104E belongs to the IgM isotype, which generally undergoes little if any hypermutation. Six nucleotide differences occur in VH Figure 3 A stereoview showing the packing of the Fab fragments in the unit cell as seen along the b axis. The a of F124 with respect to M104E, three and c axes and the origin (o) are indicated. The two independent molecules of Fab F124, related by a of which are silent mutations. Of the non-crystallographic twofold axis, are coloured red and blue, respectively. The molecules are other three differences, one is located represented as -carbon skeletons. in codon 58 (CDR-H2) and two in codon 94 (FR3), producing the aminoacid substitutions SerH583Gly and ArgH943Asn, respectively. GlyH58 is at the periphery of the antigen-binding site but appears to be well placed to make potential antigen contacts. AsnH94, which could have resulted from the joining of the V and D gene segments (Passa®ume et al., 1998), is the last framework residue before CDR-H3. Additional differences occur in the D and J segments at codons 95 (Asp), 99 (Thr) and 100A (Gly) and thus fall within CDR-H3. AspH95 is exposed at the centre of the antigen-binding site and is thus likely to be important for the speci®city and af®nity of F124. ThrH99, on the other hand, is partially buried and directed away from the binding site, while GlyH100A is completely buried. A view of the mutated residues is shown in Fig. 4.

Although ValL50 and LysL55 are located in CDR-L2, they are prevented from making potential contacts with the antigen, as this hypervariable region is shielded from the binding site by CDR-L1 and CDR-H3, particularly by the aromatic residues TyrL27D, TyrL32 and TyrH100. Moreover, LysL55 falls outside the periphery of the usual antigen-contacting residues (MacCallum et al., 1996). In this respect, it is interesting to note that CDR-L2 does not generally contribute to the antigen-binding site of anti-peptide antibodies (Stan®eld & Wilson, 1995). The mutation ArgL903Gln occurs in CDR-L3 but is buried and would thus not directly affect contacts with the antigen. Searches with the F124 VH sequence revealed no closely homologous germ-line VH gene segment in the databases. Nonetheless, the variable heavy-chain domain is encoded by a VH gene segment that shows 97.6% nucleotide sequence identity to that of M104E (J558 VH gene family) and by the D and J gene segments DFL16.1 and JH3, respectively.

The CDRs of VH and VL conform to the canonical structure hypothesis put forward by Chothia and Lesk (Chothia & Lesk, 1987; Chothia et al., 1989), i.e. that with the exception of CDR-H3, the structure of hypervariable loops can be described by a very limited number of possible main-chain conformations. Thus, for F124, CDR-H1 belongs to canonical structure 1, CDR-H2 to 2, CDR-L1 to 5, CDR-L2 to 1 and CDR-L3 to 1 (Chothia et al., 1989, 1992; Martin & Thornton, 1996; Al-Lazikani et al., 1997). CDR-H3 has ten residues and is thus slightly longer than the mean length of 8.7 for this hypervariable region in murine antibodies (Wu et al., 1993). The antigen-binding site of F124 takes the form of a groove Ê Ê running along the VH/VL interface, about 16 A long by 10 A Ê deep, modulated by the presence of pocketwide and 8 A shaped cavities (Fig. 5). It is thus similar to certain other antisaccharide antibodies of known three-dimensional structure: YsT9.1 (Evans et al., 1994), BR96 (Jeffrey et al., 1995) and ME36.1 (Pichla et al., 1997). As already noted, the VH domain of F124 and ME36.1 are closely related in sequence and structure. By contrast, Se155-4, an antibody directed against the O-antigen of Salmonella, possesses an antigen-binding site Ê with a rather ¯at topology which includes a pocket 7 A wide Ê deep (Cygler et al., 1991).

In both cases, aromatic residues in the antigenbinding site do not interact hydrophobically with the hexose rings of the ligand to the same extent as found in other protein± carbohydrate complexes (Vyas, 1991), but rather are involved in hydrogen bonding in the case of tryptophan and tyrosine.

The anti-preS2 monoclonal antibody F124 conforms to the suggestion that the antigen-binding sites of anti-saccharide antibodies generally adopt a groove- or pocket-type topology (Cisar et al., 1975; Padlan & Kabat, 1991).
