ABSTRACT The ribosome inactivating protein PD-L4 from Phytolacca dioica is a N-b-glycosidase, probably involved in plant defence. The crystal structures of wild type PD-L4 and of the S211A PD-L4 mutant with significantly decreased catalytic activity were determined at atomic resolution. To determine the structural determinants for the reduced activity of S211A PD-L4, both forms have also been co-crystallized with adenine, the major product of PD-L4 catalytic reaction. In the structure of the S211A mutant, the cavity formed by the lack of the Ser hydroxyl group is filled by a water molecule; the insertion of this non-isosteric group leads to small albeit concerted changes in the tightly packed active site of the enzyme. These changes have been correlated to the different activity of the mutant enzyme. This work highlights the importance of atomic resolution studies for the deep understanding of enzymatic properties.

INTRODUCTION Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are rRNA N-b-glycosidases (EC number 3.2.2.22) which are likely involved in the defence mechanism of plants against external pathogens.1­6 RIPs catalytically remove a single adenine base from the highly conserved a-sarcin/ricin loop of large ribosomal RNA. This loop is of particular interest due to its crucial role in elongation related events of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes.7 It shows a structure composed of a stem and a loop containing two frequently found RNA motifs, a bulged G, and a tetraloop, and it contains the longest known conserved ribosomal sequence (A2654­A2665 in Escherichia coli 23S RNA or A4318 to A4329 in rat 28S RNA). Once ribosomes are depurinated at the a-sarcin/ricin loop, they are unable to interact with the elongation factors and thus protein synthesis is irreversibly inhibited.2 RIPs are also able to remove adenine from various polynucleotides other than RNA and are more generally considered as adenine polynucleotide glycosylases (APG).3,8,9 Indeed, they display antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities.10,11 As such, RIPs possess potential human therapeutic and agricultural applications. Several immunotoxins derived from RIPs have been prepared and assayed against specific target cells both in vitro and in vivo.12­14 Type 1 RIPs have the potential to be highly cytotoxic agents against cancer cells. However, in contrast to type 2 RIPs, such as ricin, they lack the lectin chain which is necessary to bind to cell-surface lectin receptors and cause cellular internalization. They are, therefore, not very toxic to cancer cells unless action is taken to allow the molecules to penetrate into cells. For example, covalent conjugation to monoclonal

antibodies that recognize tumor antigens and, more recently, photochemical internalization has produced immunotoxins that possess cancer cell selectivity.15,16 Although high resolution structure of various RIPs have been determined,17­24 the mechanism by which they inhibit cell growth is still not fully understood. A number of residues are believed to be essential for catalysis. Of these, Tyr69, Glu172, Arg175, Trp206 (Pokeweed antiviral protein-I, PAP-I, numbering) are by far the most important. The currently accepted reaction mechanism involves the protonation of the adenine to be cleaved and the successive hydrolysis by a water molecule of the positively charged oxicarbonium intermediate. However, the residues involved in the protonation of the adenyl group are not known and contrasting hypotheses have been proposed.25­27 It has also been proposed that Tyr72 may act as a valve carrying the RNA to be cleaved from the protonation site to the cleavage site,25 although the exact location of these sites is not clear. Beside the above-mentioned residues, it appears evident from sequence alignment of all known RIPs that other residues, located outside the active site cleft, are either invariant or highly conserved. We have recently started a site-directed mutagenesis study using a RIP from leaves of Phytolacca dioica, named as PD-L4, as a model system in order to evaluate the impact of such residues on the enzymatic activity of RIPs.28 Leaves of Phytolacca dioica produce several type 1 RIPs, named PD-L1, PD-L2, PDL3, and PD-L4. Of these, PD-L4 is the sole isoform which is not glycosylated.29 In this framework, it has been evidenced that a role in catalysis is exerted by the invariant residue Ser211.28 Indeed, the mutation of the invariant Ser-211 to Ala determines a significant decrease in APG activity, with the major extent of reduction for poly(A) substrates.28 With the aim of gaining insights into the reaction mechanism of RIPs and to understand the structural bases of the reduced activity of the PD-L4 S211A mutant, we have determined the crystal structures of both wild type PDL4 (wtPD-L4) and of its S211A mutant (S211APD-L4) as well as of the complexes of these two forms with adenine, the major product of their enzymatic reaction. The crystal structures reported here are the highest resolution structures ever reported for a RIP. As such, they will constitute reference structures for this class of proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein crystallization

Hepes (pH 7.5). Similar conditions, with a protein concentration of 10 mg mL21, produced high quality crystals of S211APD-L4 with a slightly different morphology than those of wtPD-L4. Complexes of both wtPD-L4 and of S211APD-L4 with adenine were prepared by co-crystallization in the presence of 5 mM adenine, which was also added to the stabilizing and the cryo solutions.
Data collection and processing

Crystals were flash-cooled after the addition of increasing amounts (4, 7, 14% (v/v)) ethylene glycol to the crystallization buffer. The addition of the cryo-protectant in three steps, each lasting about 1 min, was necessary to avoid deterioration of crystal quality. Preliminary diffraction data were collected in-house at 100 K using a Rigaku Micromax 007 HF generator producing Cu Ka radiation and equipped with a Saturn944 CCD detector. Intensity data were processed and scaled using program HKL2000 (HKL Research).31 Diffraction data for this structural study were collected at beamline BW7A of the DESY synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany) at 100 K. Complete datasets were registered for wtPD-L4 and S211APD-L4 both in their unliganded forms and in the presence of adenine. The data collection, processing, and scaling statistics are shown in Table I.
Structure determination, refinement, and validation

Crystallization trials were conducted using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique as previously reported.30 Best crystals of wtPD-L4, of size 0.1 mm 3 0.1 mm 3 0.4 mm, were obtained in about 4 days using a protein concentration of 8 mg mL21 in the presence of 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, 10% (v/v) isopropanol, and 0.1M

The solution of the structure has been obtained using molecular replacement and the program ``il Milione.''32 The structure of PAP from Phytolacca americana (PDB code 1qcg) has been used as a starting model.21 Crystallographic refinement was first carried out against 95% of the measured data using the CCP4 program suite.33 The remaining 5% of the observed data, which was randomly selected, was used in Rfree calculations to monitor the progress of refinement. The refinement in Refmac was ° started using data up to 1.7 A resolution and gradually increased in subsequent rounds of refinement to the highest resolutions.34 At this stage, water molecules were incorporated into the structure in several rounds of successive refinement. This refined model was used to perform CGLS refinement using SHELXL97,35 where X-ray intensities were used in refinement calculations. The bond distances and angles (1,2 and 1,3 distances) were restrained using standard Engh and Huber parameters.36 Each round of refinement with SHELXL consisted of 10 cycles of restrained CGLS refinement followed by manual model adjustments using (2Fo 2 Fc) and (Fo 2 Fc) electron-density maps. Initial rounds of restrained CGLS refinement were carried out by keeping all atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) isotropic. Subsequently, the ADPs were converted to anisotropic values, leading to improved Fourier maps. At this stage, alternative

conformations visible in the electron-density maps were modeled and refined isotropically before being refined anisotropically. The bulk solvent was modeled based on Babinet's principle, as implemented in the SWAT option in the SHELXL program. An approximate isotropic behavior was attributed to solvent atoms (ISOR restraint). The final round of refinement was carried out with the inclusion of riding H atoms for protein residues. The positions of H atoms assigned based on the known geometrical criteria were not refined. Structures were validated using the programs PROCHECK37 and the inhouse GEOM-X (De Simone, A. et al., unpublished).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The crystal structures of the wild type RIP from Phytalocca dioica (wtPD-L4) and of its S211A mutant (S211APD-L4) with significantly decreased APG activity have been determined at atomic resolution. In addition, we have determined the structures of complexes of these two proteins with adenine, the major product of the catalytic reaction.

A slight difference between the unit cell parameters of crystals of wtPD-L4 and S211APD-L4 could be detected (e.g. c axis change of 7­8%) (Table I). These variations in the unit cell are larger than those expected due to crystal flash cooling (1­3%).38 However, they are not to be ascribed to the S211A mutation, since other crystals of wtPD-L4 obtained in the same conditions presented the same unit cell as S211APD-L4 (Table I). Consistently, a unit cell similar to that of S211APD-L4 (a 5 43.80, b 5 62.67, c 5 93.42) was also measured for wtPD-L4 at room temperature. The low temperature structure from these crystals was also refined (Table I) in order to dissect effects due to a unit cell difference and those due to the S211A mutation. All structures, solved by molecular replacement, have been independently refined with an anisotropic treatment of the ADPs.

° are close to 0.03 A for all structures. Final rms values of electron density in the (Fo 2 Fc) maps are about 0.05 e ° A23 for all structures and final R-factors, calculated on F > 4r, fall within the range 10­12% (see Materials and Methods and Table I). The availability of independently refined structures provided valuable validation tools to assess the significance of subtle structural features. Indeed, distributions of NCaC angles and of pyramidalization angles at the carbonyl C atoms were analyzed to validate the final models.39 For NCaC angles analyses, residues in secondary structure elements were selected according to Kabsch and Sander.40 Although the same target value was used (111.28) for the refinement of the whole structure, different distributions of the NCaC angles were found for residues adopting a-helix and those adopting b-strand conformations (Table I). In particular, the mean values of NCaC angles were close to 109.5 and 111.58 for bstrands and a-helices, respectively (Table I and Fig. S1). In addition, as expected for atomic resolution models, values of pyramidalization angles (y) were found to depend upon protein backbone conformation, despite the use of the planarity restraints for the peptide groups during refinement (target y is zero).39,41 In particular, positive values of the y angle were observed for residues adopting a-helical conformation, whereas negative values are adopted by residues in the extended conformation, with an average y value of 0.48 and 21.08 for w ranging from 2608 to 08 and from 120 to 1808, respectively (Table I and Fig. S2).
Crystal structures of wtPD-L4 in the unliganded state and in complex with adenine

Analogous to other RIPs (ricin A-chain, trichosanthin, PAP-I), PDL4 is composed of two domains and has a well-defined secondary structure: eight a-helices and a twisted b-sheet composed of six strands [Fig. 1(A)]. PDL4 also contains two disulfide bonds, one between cysteines 34 and 258 and the other between residues 84 and 105. The overall structure of the protein is similar to that of the low temperature crystal structure of the pokeweed antiviral protein (PDB code 1qcg), with an average r.m.s.d. value after superposition of 261 equivalent Ca ° atoms of 0.65 A. Structural differences are mainly located on the protein surface and in loop regions. Despite the structural similarity of PDL4 with PAP-I, we observed that the electrostatic potential surface of the two proteins differ significantly [Fig. 1(B,C)]. Several residues constituting the putative RNA binding site cleft are different; as an example, Asp233 (residue 234 in 1qcg) is a conserved Gly in all PAP-I structures known. These differences make the electrostatic potential surface of PDL4 more negatively charged in this region [Fig. 1(B,C)]. This

RNA-binding region [Fig. 1(A)]. The side chains of most of the active site residues of PD-L4 (Tyr72, Tyr122, Glu175, and Arg178) have roughly the same positioning as the corresponding residues in PAP-I. Analysis of the refined model of wtPDL4 in the unliganded state shows that two well-defined conformations exist for the active site Tyr72 (Fig. 2). In contrast, only one of the two Tyr72 conformations, the less abundant in the unliganded state (occupancy factor 0.15), is observed in the adenine complex; in this conformation, the phenoxy plane of Tyr72 is almost parallel with that

of the adenine base (Fig. 3). Many different protein systems, beside RIPs, employ Tyr residues in the recognition of the adenine ring, through a p­p stacking interaction.44 Also, the orientation of Ade and Tyr72, with the Tyr OH group pointing at the N9 atom of adenine, has been found to be the most frequent in proteins; this has been attributed to the occurrence of favourable electrostatic interactions between the two rings.44 The observed tight interaction of Tyr72 ring with ade° nine (with a distance between their centroids of 3.75 A) as well as the existence of two conformations in the unliganded wtPD-L4 are likely to be a requirement for the catalytic role of adenine carrier attributed to Tyr72.25 It is worth noting that the A conformation of Tyr72 (Fig. 2) is nearly superposable to that observed in the complex of inactive mutants of trichosanthin with AMP.26 Consistent with these findings, we believe that Tyr72 in the A conformation (Fig. 2) is devoted to the binding of the adenyl group in the early stages of the reaction mechanism. Modeling of AMP with Tyr72 in the A conformation shows that adenine is in the near proximity to Asp91, likely to be the protonating moiety (data not shown).25 This is consistent with crystallographic data showing that when this residue (Glu-85 in trichosanthin) is mutated to an uncharged residue, the enzyme is not active.26 We also propose that, after protonation, the adenyl group remains bound to the A conformation of Tyr72 (Fig. 2) since it is unlikely that a positively charged adenine could be hydrogen bonded to the positively charged Arg178 (Fig. 3). Finally, only when the N-glycosidic bond has been cleaved, the product adenine is accompanied to its final destination by Tyr72 (B conformation, Fig. 2) and establishes the hydrogen bonding

interactions (to Arg178, Val73, Ser120) observed in the structures of the adenine complex of wtPDL4 (Fig. 3). As reported earlier,25 the N7 atom of adenine interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Ser120; this implies that adenine exists as a N7-H tautomer when in complex with PD-L4. This tautomer has been shown to be less abundant in water than the tautomer N9-H (with a concentration ratio of about 1:4) and to be stabilized in polar media, likely due to the larger dipole moment of N7-H compared to N9-H.45 We suggest that Arg178 also exerts a key role in stabilising the N7-H tautomer in the complex of adenine with PD-L4. Indeed, besides forming a hydrogen bond with adenine N3 atom, Arg178 is likely to stabilise the N7-H adenine dipole and to release the repulsion between lone pairs of N3 and N9 (Fig. 3).

Crystal structures of S211APD-L4 in the unliganded form and in complex with adenine: structural basis of the depressed activity of S211APD-L4

A comparative analysis of the crystal structures of and of wtPD-L4 shows that, overall, the two structures are nearly identical, with r.m.s.d. deviations of ° the Ca atoms of 0.37 A. Differences, however, exist in the neighborhood of the mutation site. In the crystal structure of S211APD-L4, the formation of a cavity formed by the lack of the Ser211 OH group is not compensated by a reorganization of the local enzyme structure, but the OH is replaced by a water molecule. This result was not easy to predict, since attempts to model the S211A mutation failed in the interpretation of structural events and attributed a large mobility to the catalytic Trp207.28 Also, circular dichroism studies have indicated that S211APD-L4 exhibits a significantly lower melting temperature (data not shown), likely due to the formation of a hydrophobic cavity. In this respect, the insertion of a water molecule in the generated cavity does not compensate for the enzyme destabilization. In wtPD-L4, Trp207 has limited conformational freedom due to hydrogen bonding interactions of its Ne1 atom with the carbonyl oxygen of Leu250 and to the steric hindrance generated by Ser211 (Fig. 4). As a consequence of the S211A mutation, the indole ring of Trp207 adopts in S211APD-L4 a tilted conformation, with a v2 angle change of about 98, compared to that adopted in wtPD-L4 (Fig. 5). Notably, this change is not dissipated but transmitted to other protein regions. Indeed, a backbone movement of the region around Asn70 towards Trp207 is observed (Fig. 5), likely to optimize van der Waals interactions. As a cascade, small movement of the catalytic Arg178 side chain, which is hydrogen bonded to Asn70 carbonyl oxygen, are observed. Backbone movements are confirmed by a difference­distance matrix analysis between S211APD-L4 and wtPD-L4, which clearly shows that the N-terminal region 50­120 moves closer to

and (B)

the C-terminal region 180­262 (Fig. S3). Difference­distance matrix analysis also evidences that, likely due to the unfavorable interactions of the water molecule (replacing the serine Og) with the side chain of Ala211, helix 6 becomes locally more elongated [Fig. 5(B) and S3]. Indeed, residues ranging from 211 to 218 become more distant from other protein regions (Fig. S3). These differences also exist between S211APD-L4 and the nonisomorphous wtPD-L4 (Table I), where other changes, due to a different packing, are also evident (Fig. S4). Notably, the observation that the enzyme structure is not able to absorb even small structural changes and that these changes are propagated through the structure is an indication of the essentiality that side chains are precisely located in the active site. The analysis of the structure of S211APD-L4 in complex with adenine shows that the position and orientation of Trp207 indole becomes nearly identical to that observed

nine pocket and, consequently, has not attracted attention before. We observed that Ser211 acts as a lock for the catalytic Trp207 and, as a consequence, for Arg178. Indeed, the Trp207 conformation adopted in wtPD-L4 (conserved in all available PDB structures) is strictly required to precisely position Arg178. This conformation, which is slightly changed in S211APD-L4, is readopted in the complex S211APD-L4-Ade. This indicates that the conformation of Trp207 observed in the complexes of both wtPD-L4 and S211APD-L4 with adenine is mandatory for adenine binding. In this respect, our data suggest that the role of Ser211 is (i) to limit the conformational freedom of Trp207, thus contributing to the definition of a rigid hydrophobic cavity which is likely to stabilize adenine binding and protect it from the solvent, and (ii) to prevent the access to water molecules, which inevitably make the region less rigid. In conclusion, the present study shows that subtle albeit significant structural changes are responsible for significant differences in the enzymatic activity. This highlights the importance of atomic resolution studies for the understanding of enzymatic properties.46,47 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

in both the structures of wtPD-L4 and of the wtPD-L4Ade complex. This repositioning of Trp207 upon adenine binding occurs, despite a noticeable strain, as indicated by existence of short contacts in the newly formed cavity (Fig. 5). These data indicate that precise positioning of Trp207 and of Arg178 are required for proper adenine binding. In this framework, the significantly lower activity of S211APD-L4 compared to wtPD-L4 can be directly linked to a higher flexibility in S211APD-L4 of residues such as Arg178 and Trp207, which already adopt, in wtPD-L4, the proper conformations for adenine binding.

CONCLUSIONS The present atomic-resolution structures of wtPD-L4 and S211APD-L4 represent a significant improvement in the structural model available for RIPs. The availability of highly accurate models, refined at atomic resolution, has allowed us to provide an explanation for the decreased catalytic activity of the S211APD-L4 mutant. As a consequence, we could define a role for Ser211, a residue which is not located in the near proximity of ade-
