Abstract Two related oncogenes, TCL1 and MTCP1, are overexpressed in certain T-cell prolymphocytic leukemias as a result of chromosomal rearrangements that involve the translocation of one T-cell receptor gene to either chromosome 14q32 or Xq28, respectively. The human oncoprotein p13MTCP1 is coded by the MTCP1 gene and its primary sequence is highly and only homologous to that of p14TCL1 , the product of TCL1. These two proteins likely represent the first members of a new family of oncogenic proteins. A previous model of the three-dimensional solution structure of p13MTCP1 was determined recently using exclusively homonuclear proton two-dimensional NMR methods and, almost simultaneously, high-resolution crystal structures of p13MTCP1 and p14TCL1 appeared in the literature. In order to gain more insight into the details of the solution structure, we uniformly labeled p13MTCP1 with nitrogen-15. The refined structure benefits from 520 additional NOEs, extracted from either 15 Nedited 3D experiments or homonuclear 2D NOESY recorded at 800 MHz, and from a nearly complete set of  angular restraints. Measurements of 15 N spin relaxation times and heteronuclear 15 N{1 H}NOEs at two magnetic field strengths provided additional insights into the dynamics of the protein backbone. On the basis of these new results, a putative binding surface for this particular class of oncogenes is discussed.

these diseases (Croce, 1987). These chromosomal translocations have been proposed to occur during recombination events of the TCR genes: they juxtapose cellular protooncogenes to enhancer elements, leading to deregulation of oncogene expression. The two oncogenes often involved in these translocations are MTCP1 (also called c6.1B) (Fisch et al., 1993; Stern et al., 1993) and TCL1 (Virgilio et al., 1993; Fu et al., 1994; Narducci et al., 1995; Thick et al., 1996), which

216 belong to a new family of genes involved in lymphoid proliferation and T-cell malignancies. Very recently, a new gene named TCL1b (Pekarsky et al., 1999) has been identified, located 16 kb centromeric of TCL1. It is also involved in similar T-cell leukemias and constitutes the third gene identified from this new family. The MTCP1 gene, located in the Xq28 chromosomal region, was the first gene to be identified in the heterogenous group of uncommon T-cell leukemias presenting a mature phenotype (Stern et al., 1993). It is involved in the translocation t(X;14)(q28;q11), a translocation recurrently associated with this type of T-cell proliferations. It codes for a 107-residue (13 kDa) protein known as p13MTCP1 (Madani et al., 1996), which expression is restricted to mature Tcell proliferations with t(X;14) translocations (Madani et al., 1995). This protein shows high sequence homology (40% identity, 61% similarity) with p14TCL1 (Fu et al., 1994), the product of the 14q32.1 oncogene TCL1, and with p14TCL1b (36% identity, 63% similarity), the product of the newly identified TCL-1b oncogene (Pekarsky et al., 1999). We reported previously the elucidation of the 3D structure of p13MTCP1 using exclusively homonuclear 2D NMR (Yang et al., 1998). Then, using this previous model of the solution structure of p13MTCP1 for molecular replacement, the crystal structure of p14TCL1 was solved in our laboratory (Hoh et al., 1998). Finally, a high resolution crystal structure of p13MTCP1 was determined using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data from selenomethionine-enriched protein (Fu et al., 1998). The two oncogenic proteins p13MTCP1 and p14TCL1 share a virtually identical 3D structure, the main structural motif of which consists of a compact eight-stranded -barrel with an original topology. Interestingly, p13MTCP1 is a monomeric protein, whereas p14TCL1 forms a tight dimer both in the crystal and in solution, as indicated by gel filtration and DOSY experiments (unpublished results). Structural similarities between p14TCL1 and p13MTCP1 suggest that their (unknown) function may be analogous and allow their classification as a novel class of oncogenes. In the present paper, we now report the refined solution structure of the 15 N-labeled protein p13MTCP1, using double-resonance heteronuclear NMR. We complemented the structural study by an analysis of the backbone dynamics using experimental 15 N relaxation parameters measured on the NH vectors at two magnetic field strengths. Implications for the cellular function of these oncogene products are discussed on the basis of a comparison of both structural and dynamical features of the solution and the crystal structure of p13MTCP1.

Materials and methods Protein preparation A more precise cloning of the p13MTCP1 gene was done, using PCR-based mutagenesis, in order to eliminate the eight extra residues introduced at the Cterminal end of the protein expressed in our original pGEX- p13MTCP1 construct. The resulting pGEXp13MTCP1 was introduced into E. coli strain BL21. The mutant protein was purified as previously described for the original construct (Yang et al., 1998). Uniform 15 N labeling was achieved by growing the cells in minimal medium with 15 NH4 Cl as sole nitrogen source. NMR measurements NMR experiments were carried out at 9.4 or 14.1 Tesla on Bruker AMX400 and AMX600 spectrometers equipped with 5 mm z-gradient 1 H-13 C-15 N triple resonance probes. Protein samples were dissolved in a 20 mM phosphate buffer with 10% 2 H2 O for the lock. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 and the temperature set to 30  C. In all experiments, the 1 H carrier was centred on the water resonance and a WATERGATE (Piotto et al., 1992; Sklenar, 1995) sequence was incorporated to suppress the solvent resonance. Quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions was achieved using States-TPPI (Marion et al., 1989b). In addition, 2D homonuclear experiments were performed at 800 MHz (Bruker DMX800) on a non-enriched protein sample dissolved in heavy water. NMR spectra were processed with the Gifa (version 4.22; Pons et al., 1996) software utility. 2D homonuclear spectroscopy Homonuclear 2D experiments (NOESY (Jeener et al., 1979), z-TOCSY (Rance, 1987) and DQF-COSY (Rance et al., 1983)) were carried out at 800 MHz on a 1 mM non-enriched protein sample using similar experimental conditions and parameters as previously described (Yang et al., 1998). measurement A series of 12 J-modulated [1 H,15 N] COSY spectra (Neri et al., 1990) was performed at 600 MHz on a
NH-H 3J

217 1 mM 15 N-labeled protein sample, using different evolution delays in the range 10­100 ms for homonuclear J-modulation. The conventional experiment was modified in order to introduce the WATERGATE sequence in the last reverse INEPT step for water suppression purposes (Santoro et al., 1996). The peak heights were then fitted accordingly (Billeter et al., 1992) to extract the individual coupling constant values. [1 H,15 N] 3D experiments NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC (Fesik and Zuiderweg, 1988; Marion et al., 1989a; Bax et al., 1990) double resonance [1 H,15 N] 3D spectra were acquired at 600 MHz with a uniformly 15 N-labeled 2 mM sample of protein. The NOESY experiments were recorded with a mixing time of 150 ms and the TOCSY experiment with an isotropic mixing period (TOWNY (Kadkhodaei et al., 1993)) of 60 ms. WALTZ-16 modulation (Shaka et al., 1983) was used to decouple 15 N during acquisition. Relaxation rate constant and 15 N{1 H}NOE measurements Relaxation rate constant measurements were performed on a 1 mM protein sample, at 9.4 T (400 MHz) and 14.1 T (600 MHz). The pulse sequences used to determine 15 N RN (Nz ) (R1 ), RN (Nxy ) (R2 ), and 15 N{1 H}NOE values were similar to those described (Kay et al., 1992; Peng and Wagner, 1992a,b), experimental parameters and processing were similar to those previously reported for the relaxation study of C12A-p8MTCP1 (Barthe et al., 1999). Molecular modeling calculations All calculations were carried out following the standard protocol described for our previous model of p13MTCP1 (Yang et al., 1998). Briefly, distance restraints were obtained from the volume of cross peaks measured on 2D NOESY and [1 H-15 N] 3D NOESYHSQC spectra and classified as strong, medium and weak corresponding to 2.4, 3.6 and 4.8 Å upper bounds. Angular restraints on the  dihedral angles were obtained from the coupling constants 3 JNH-H , using two cutoffs for coupling constants greater than 8.0 Hz and less than 6.0 Hz, respectively constrained to -120±30 and -90±30 . In addition, 1 angles were obtained from the analysis of the 3 JH-H coupling constants and intra-residue NOEs (Hyberts et al., 1987). From these restraints, a set of 20 structures was generated with the variable target function program DYANA (Güntert et al., 1997), using the torsion angle dynamic algorithm, with a value of the target function smaller than 3 Å2 and no distance violation larger than 0.3 Å. The  and 1 angles showed no violation greater than 5 . The average structure obtained from the 20 best structures (based on the final target penalty function values) was further refined with molecular mechanics energy with the SANDER module of AMBER 4.1 (Pearlman et al., 1995) using the 1994 force field (Cornell et al., 1995). Relaxation data analysis When the relaxation of the 15 N nucleus is predominantly caused by the dipolar interaction with its attached amide proton and by the anisotropy of its chemical shift, the relaxation data can be interpreted in terms of the motion of the 15 N-1 H vector. Given that the three experimentally determined parameters, RN (Nz ), RN (Nxy) and NOE, depend on the spectral density function at five different frequencies (Abragam, 1961), the calculation of the spectral density values can be approached by the application of the so-called reduced spectral density mapping, in which the relaxation rates are directly translated into spectral density at three different frequencies (Peng and Wagner, 1992a,b; Farrow et al., 1995; Ishima and Nagayama, 1995a,b; Lefèvre et al., 1996):

218 N (-2.711 107 rad.s-1 .T-1 ) are the gyromagnetic ratios of the 1 H and the 15 N nuclei, respectively, and H and N are the 1 H and 15 N Larmor frequency, respectively; rNH is the internuclear 15 N-1 H distance (1.02 Å), B0 is the magnetic field strength, and  is the difference between the parallel and perpendicular components of the axially symmetric 15 N chemical shift tensor, estimated to be -160 ppm (Hiyama et al., 1988). For a magnetic field of 14.1 (9.4) Tesla, d2 = 1.2986 109 rad2 .s-2 and c2 = 1.2452 109 (0.553 109) rad2 .s-2 . The cross-relaxation rate RN (Hz Nz ) between 15 N and its attached amide proton is correlated with NOE and is calculated using NOE = 1 + (H /N ).RN (Hz  Nz )/RN (Nz ). The frequency in the average spectral density, <J(H )>, may be taken equal to 0.87H (Farrow et al., 1995). In addition to a better sampling of the spectral density function, a comparison of J(0) values at different B0 strengths provides a means of screening the relaxation data for R2ex contributions. Since R2ex scales as the square of the N Larmor frequency, we can is write R2ex = 2 (Peng and Wagner, 1995). N then derived from the observed J(0)obs at two B0 fields (field1 and field2 ) via the ratio: = (J(0)obs1 - J(0)obs2)/(1 2 - 2 2 ) (2) N1 N2 1 and 2 are scale factors (3/2)[1/(3d2+c2 )] and are approximately 0.34 and 0.31 ns/rad at 9.4 and 14.1 T, respectively. The true value of J(0), corrected from exchange processes, can therefore be expressed as (Peng and Wagner, 1995): J(0) = J(0)obs - 2 N (3) J(0) is field independent and  depends on 2 through N the CSA factor c2 . It has also been proposed to extract the R2ex value from the linear relation between 2RN (Nxy ) - RN (Nz ) and 2 (Habazettl and Wagner, N2 1995; Vis et al., 1998): this approach yields similar results as those obtained from Equation 2, when using the experimental relaxation rates measured on p13MTCP1. The model-free approach of Lipari and Szabo (1982) was then used to further describe the mobility in terms of specific types of motion. This formalism makes the assumption that overall and internal motions contribute independently to the reorientational time correlation function of 15 N-1 H vectors and that internal motions occur on a much faster time scale than the global rotation of the molecule. For an isotropically tumbling protein, one obtains:  c 2 2 S + (1 - S2 ) (4) J() = f 5 f 1 + (c )2 1 + ()2 where  is the harmonics of the overall and the internal (fast) correlation time which pertains to each residue: -1 = -1 + -1 . Fast internal motions are characterc f ized by the square of a generalised order parameter S2 , which describes the relative amplitude of interf nal motions and ranges from 0 to 1, and an internal correlation time f for the internal motions. For some of the residues, the simple form of Equation 4 turns out to be insufficient to fit the whole set of experimental data. This occurs when residues exhibit internal motions in a time window close to 1 ns. In this case, the expression for the spectral density function is extended to (Clore et al., 1990b): J() = c 2 2 2 S S 5 f s 1 + (c )2  +S2 (1 - S2 ) s f 1 + ()2

(5)

with -1 = -1 + -1 , where S2 and S2 are the c s s f square of the partial order parameters for fast (picosecond time scale) and slow (s , nanosecond time scale) internal motions, respectively. The square of the generalized order parameter S2 , defined as S2 S2 , is a f s measure of the total amplitude of the internal motions. Note that S2 equals S2 in Equation 4. Equation 5 asf sumes that the contribution of the fastest motion to the spectral density function is negligible. The values of the motional parameters of the individual residues can be derived from the fit of experimental J(0), J(40 MHz), J(60 MHz), <J(400 MHz)> and <J(600 MHz)> using Equations 4 and 5. An iterative non-linear least-squares algorithm (Press et al., 1986) was employed to further minimize the error function. The `extended' model was selected if 2 was larger than the appropriate critical value (95% confidence interval) and if this more complex model could be statistically justified by a Fischer­Snedecor test (F-test) (Saporta, 1990).

Results NMR structure refinement and comparison with X-ray structures In our first model for the 3D solution structure of p13MTCP1, obtained by homonuclear proton 2D NMR methods at 600 MHz (Yang et al., 1998), 87% of the proton resonances were unambiguously assigned. In the present study, all the previously made proton assignments were easily confirmed and extended in the

219 planes of the [1 H-15 N] 3D NMR experiments at 600 MHz and in the homonuclear 2D NMR experiments at 800 MHz: the backbone and aliphatic side chain 1 H, 15 N resonance assignments of p13MTCP1 at pH 6.5 have been completed, except for the C-terminal Asp107 due to fast exchange with water. The resulting 1 H and 15 N assignments are available from the authors as Supplementary material. The substantial increase in NMR restraints (Table 1 and Figure 1a) translates in an approximate twofold decrease in the average rmsd values compared to our previous model, for all structural elements. The excellent convergence of the solution structure modeling calculations is supported by rmsd values generally smaller than the ones calculated from the crystallographic B-factors for the X-ray structure of p13MTCP1 (Figure 1b). The main structural motif of p13MTCP1 is an orthogonal -barrel consisting of eight antiparallel -strands of variable length, with a unique and common topology of this oncoprotein family (Figure 2a). The -strands are arranged into two very similar upand-down four-stranded -meander motifs: motif1, composed of strands A­D, and motif 2, composed of strands E­H. Each motif consists of one short (A­B or E­D) and one long (C­D or G­H) two-stranded sheet, which together form an L-shape. The ends of the long -strand pairs (C­D and G­H) are not involved in the barrel hydrogen bond pattern, but protrude from the core of the molecule, forming two -pleated loops. The two -sheet motifs are connected by a long poorly structured loop (segment Gln48-Pro66). In this loop, NOEs of type (i, i+3) were observed in the [1 H-15 N] 3D-NOESY-HSQC at 600 MHz and the 2D NOESY experiments at 800 MHz for the segment Arg56-Ser63, consistent with the presence of a helical conformation. This helical segment has been reported in the crystal structure of p13MTCP1 but was not detected in our previous NMR structure, due to strong overlapping of many proton resonances of residues in this loop. Nevertheless, relatively strong dN (i, i+1) effects were found concomitantly with dNN (i, i+1) effects, suggesting a conformational equilibrium between the helix and an extended or more flexible conformation within this peptidic segment. Supporting this assumption, the 3 JNH-H coupling constants measured for residues Arg56, Leu61 and Thr62 are in the range of 6 to 7 Hz, which significantly deviate from the expected value of 4 Hz in a helix, and those measured for residues His59 and Leu60 are not consistent with a helical structure (9.1 ± 0.2 Hz and 8.0 ± 0.6 Hz, respectively). Finally, the 15 N relaxation study indi15 N

cates that significant exchange processes take place in this peptidic segment (vide infra). A stereodiagram of the superposition of the 20 final structures is shown in Figure 2b. The results of the refinement are provided in Table 1. The rms deviations between the average NMR and X-ray structures (Figure 2c) testify to their high level of similarity since most of the values are below 1 Å, with global rmsd values of 0.9 Å and 1.43 Å for backbone heavy atoms and side-chain heavy atoms, respectively. The largest differences are found in the loop connecting the two -strand motifs (segment Gln48-Pro66) and in a turn region for residues Arg94 and Gly95. The loop segment 48­66 is one of the least well-defined regions in the NMR structure, whereas in the X-ray structure the first half of this loop, from residue Gln48 to Ala55, appears well resolved. This difference comes from intermolecular contacts which stabilize the conformation seen in the crystal. The second half of this loop adopts a helical conformation from Arg56 to Ser63 both in the X-ray and in the NMR structure. The large rmsd values seen in this region are due to the global displacement of the helix between the NMR and crystal structure. Indeed, several intermolecular contacts are found in the crystal, in which two helices from different molecules pack together. Similarly, the differences observed in the segment Arg94-Gly95 can be explained by the crystal packing. In other places, discrepancies can be attributed to a lack of resolution in either the NMR or the X-ray structure. Thus, if the poor resolution of the -turn connecting strands E and F in the NMR structure can explain the increased rmsd value observed for residues Pro73 and Glu74, the lack of resolution in the X-ray structure can be invoked to explain the rmsd value observed for the side-chain of Gln48: the side-chain atoms of this residue are not well defined in the X-ray structure (B-factors ranging from 34.7 Å2 to 43.4 Å2 ), whereas the conformation of this sidechain is perfectly defined in the NMR structure, where Gln48 makes hydrogen bonds with the side-chain of Gln46. Finally, some discrepancies between the NMR and the X-ray structures cannot be explained, neither by crystal packing nor by inadequate resolution, and actually reflect differences between the crystal and the solution structure. Thus, the Trp14 side-chain displays a different orientation in solution than in the crystal, stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the indole H 1 of the tryptophan and the S atom of the Met68 side-chain. Interestingly, in the p14TCL1 structure, the tryptophan side-chain adopts an intermediate confor-

mation compared to those observed in the X-ray and NMR structures of p13MTCP1, suggesting a kind of flipping motion of this side-chain. The rmsd of 1.8 Å measured for the Arg22 side-chain is probably a consequence of the different orientation of the spacially close side-chain of Trp14. Similar conclusions can be drawn from the comparison of the solution structure of p13MTCP1 and the crystal structure of p14TCL1: most of the differences are dictated by crystal contacts (data not shown). Nevertheless, divergences observed in strand C and in the turn joining strands C and D could be attributed to divergences in the protein sequences rather than to crystal packing. In this region, two insertions in the sequence of p14TCL1 (Figure 3a) induce slight conformational differences aimed at preserving the clustering of hydrophobic residues in the -barrel interior. Thus, a -bulge is present at the entry of strand

C, and, as a consequence, the hydrophobic side chain of Leu37 involved in the bulge is solvent exposed (Figure 3b). For a similar reason, the turn between strands C and D accommodates a surnumeral residue (Gln46). Interestingly, the main dimer contact in the p14TCL1 crystal structure is conferred by the antiparallel -sheet packing of the C-strands (residues 37­41) of the two monomers. It can be postulated that the stable dimeric association of p14TCL1 is induced by the different conformation of strand C, as compared to the one observed in the monomeric protein p13MTCP1. Moreover, it is remarkable that most solvent exposed residues in this peptidic segment are hydrophobic in p14TCL1 : they form a hydrophobic cluster which stabilizes the dimeric association (Figure 3c). In the structure of p13MTCP1, a different distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in this peptidic segment should hamper a hypothetic dimeric associ-

ation, due to repulsive interactions between the negatively charged side-chain of Glu40 on each monomer (Figure 3c). Amide 15 N relaxation parameters and spectral function analysis Spectral density values at 0, 40, 60, 348 and 522 MHz were calculated from the experimental 15 N R1 , R2 and 15 N{1 H}NOEs values obtained for 87 of the 100 nonproline residues of p13MTCP1 from spectra recorded at 600 MHz and 400 MHz (full list available as Supplementary material) using Equation 1 (Figure 4). The low J(0) values for the terminal residues as well as, to a lesser extent, for the peptidic segments Glu35-Leu40 and Gln48-Leu65 are indicative of an increased flexibility. The segment Glu35-Leu40 belongs to the first four-stranded antiparallel -sheet motif (long strands C and D) but does not participate in the -barrel: it is solvent-exposed and forms one of the structured pleated loops which protrudes out of the -barrel. The segment Gln48-Leu65 forms the long poorly structured loop which joins the two -meanders, comprising the helical region. In these regions, reduced values of J(0) for flexible residues with respect to the rigid part of the protein (the -barrel) are compensated for by high values of <J(H )>. This supports the fact that the higher values of rmsd observed in this less well-

defined region are due to intrinsic flexibility rather than to a lack of structural data. Low <J(H )> values for the rest of the protein indicate restricted flexibility on fast time scales. At 40 MHz, J() values exhibit a pattern similar to that observed for J(0): a decrease is observed for NH vectors located on the loop and, to a lesser extent, for NH vectors located on the segment Glu35-Leu40. At 60 MHz, the distribution of J() as a function of residue number is almost flat, indicating proximity to the isobestic frequency, where the contribution of J() is independent of the internal mobility. The J(0) values reported in Figure 4 have been corrected for exchange contributions on the µs to ms time scale (see Materials and methods). For almost all backbone NH bonds, significant exchange contributions are observed with ranging from approximately 0.5 × 10-17 s/rad to 1.5 × 10-17 s/rad (Figure 5b). This suggests the presence of widespread exchange processes for p13MTCP1. However, the uncertainties in the values of are rather high, such that the plenitude of small values could either be indicative of an unidentified global exchange process, for example due to protein aggregation, or reflect an artifact from a presently unaccounted for field dependence in the relaxation rates. Nevertheless, significant increases in values (up to 6 × 10-17 s/rad) are seen for different peptidic segments in the protein. Thus, most of the NH

vectors located on the loop joining the two -meander motifs (Gln48-Leu65) exhibit high values, with a peak centered on the helical segment Arg56-Ser63. The presence of such intensive exchange processes strongly supports the conclusions previously drawn from the structural data, suggesting a possible equilibrium between helical and random conformations for residues located in this peptidic segment. Exchange processes are possibly reinforced by isomerization of the proline residue (Pro57) in the N-terminal end of the helical segment. Similar increases are seen on two

peptidic segments, centered on residues Pro10 and Glu98. These segments are both located at the junction of the two -meanders forming the -barrel, and residue Glu98 ends the second -pleated loop, suggesting that this loop exhibits very slow hinge-motions on the µs to ms time scale. Weaker contributions of exchange processes are also seen centered on or in the vicinity of aromatic residues: Arg27 (sequential to Tyr26) and Tyr72. These residues are involved in -bulges in the non-canonic -hairpin joining strands B­C and E­F, respectively. Due to their ring-current,

227 the motion of aromatic side-chains creates strong chemical-shift gradients on the neighbouring residues, leading to very efficient relaxation pathways. Such processes are not clearly seen in the other turns, probably due to the lack of aromatic residues in their sequence. The mapping of spectral densities J() for each backbone NH bond provides the intrinsic dynamic information from the relaxation data ­ without any assumption for the motional model ­ upon which a variety of motional models may be evaluated. Since both values of J(N ) and J(H ) decrease for almost all NH vectors with increasing frequencies N and H , respectively, the description of the spectral densities as sums of Lorentzians appears qualitatively reasonable for p13MTCP1. Adequate fits of J() are therefore expected using the model-free formalism proposed by Lipari and Szabo (1982). The combination of relaxation data sets from two different magnetic fields resulted in five independent values of the spectral density function per NH bond, while a maximum of only three parameters using Equation 5 (`extended' Lipari­Szabo model (Clore et al., 1990b)) is required to model J(), giving a substantially high number of degrees of freedom. We thus tentatively use the `nonsimplified extended' Lipari-Szabo model (Clore et al., 1990b), introducing f as a fourth additional parameter for the fit, but this procedure did not give significant improvements. On the other hand, the ratio of the principal components of the average inertia tensor for the backbone atom on the average structure of p13MTCP1 was determined to be (1.9: 1.7: 1.2). These numbers suggest that the overall rotation of the protein is expected to have only a small degree of anisotropy that may not have a strong influence, at least on the order parameter values (Tjandra et al., 1995). Thus, we do not make any attempt to introduce this contribution in the motional model. The global value of the overall rotational correlation time c was taken as the average of the values obtained independently for all residues which were well parametrized (low 2 ) by the `simple' Lipari­Szabo formalism (Equation 4) and showed order parameters higher than 0.70. This procedure leads to a correlation time equal to 7.69 ± 0.05 ns. Once the overall tumbling time c has been determined, local modelfree parameters were obtained by using either the `simple' or the `extended' (Equation 5) Lipari­Szabo formalisms. The internal dynamics of most backbone NH bonds located in the -barrel are satisfactorily parametrized using Equation 4. For the N- and Cterminal residues, the use of Equation 5 is required. The `extended' model was also necessary to correctly describe the dynamics of the NH vectors located in the solvent-exposed Glu35-Leu40 peptidic segment and in the long flexible loop, including residues in the Nterminal turns of the helix (Arg56, Ser58, His59 and Leu60). The use of the `extended' model was fully justified by the statistics, and, supporting this choice, reasonable values of s (0.5­1.5 ns) were observed while it brought undeniable improvements of the fit. Figure 5 shows a comparison between the B-factor obtained from the X-ray data of p13MTCP1 and the generalized order parameters S2 obtained from the relaxation study, as a function of the residue number. Except for the few exceptions further mentioned, the crystallographic B-factors obtained for p14TCL1 parallel those reported for p13MTCP1 (data not shown). Thus, these two proteins have not only a similar structure, but also a very similar dynamic behavior in the crystal. The lowest B-factor values are observed for residues in the -barrel, except for those located in the solvent-exposed segments of the two -pleated loops (Val32-Phe39 and His89-Val96) or in the turns joining strands B­C (Asp23-Arg27) and E­F (Tyr72-Arg76). Such a flexibility is not observed for the two other turns (joining A­B and F­G), located on the opposite face of the -barrel. In solution, as judged by S2 values ranging between 0.8 and 0.9, residues belonging to the -barrel seem to experience extremely restricted mobility. Only residues located in the solvent-exposed segment Glu35-Leu40 show significantly lower S2 values, with an additional contribution of an internal slow motion on the ns time scale to the NH dynamics. Interestingly, and contrary to what is observed in the crystal, low S2 values are not observed, either in the peptidic segment His89-Val96, symmetrically disposed on the second -pleated loop, or for the residues located in turns. Nevertheless, different motions are known to contribute to the value of X-ray isotropic B-factors: thermal fluctuations, static and dynamic conformational disorder (molecules existing in different conformations in the crystal), and lattice disorder (crystal heterogeneity). Thus, B-factors reflect protein mobility on two distinct time scales: 10-15 to 10-11 s (fast thermal fluctuations) and 10-9 to 10-3 s (conformational changes). Rather than a crystal artefact, we believe that the increased B-factor values seen for residues in the peptidic segment His89-Val96 are consistent with the existence of a possible slow hinge-motion of this loop. In solution, this motion was suggested by the analysis of transverse relaxation

228 rates at two B0 fields which demonstrated that exchange processes took place in the same area of the protein, centered around residue Glu98. Similarly, the slight increases in values observed for residues in the segments Gln26-Thr28 and Trp69-Tyr72 suggest that slow exchange motions take place in the turns joining the strands B­C and E­F. In solution, the long loop joining the two -meander motifs exhibits very complex motions. An additional contribution of an internal slow motion on the ns time scale is needed to describe the motion of the residues located in the segment Val49-Leu60, spanning the unstructured part of the loop and the first half of the helical segment. In this peptidic segment, S2 parameters drop from about 0.8 (Val49) to 0.35 for Gly52, in the central part of the unstructured loop, and increase again up to residue Arg56, at the entry of the helix, indicating a relation between the decrease of the motion restriction and the remoteness of the considered residue from the structured core of the protein. Then, S2 parameters drop again until residue Leu 60, in the centre of the helical segment, whereas fast motions ­ on the ps time scale ­ in the second half of the helix appear as restricted as in the -barrel. In addition, this loop undergoes very slow motions on the µs to ms time scale, as indicated by the values measured in this segment. As previously quoted, exchange processes appear to affect predominantly residues in the helical segment. The high B-factor values observed in the helix indicate that this segment also exhibits an enhanced mobility in the crystal of p13MTCP1 but, contrary to what is observed in solution, the unstructured part of the loop (residues Gln48-Arg56) shows only a slight increase in B-factors. This different behavior between the solution and the crystal could be attributed to the close packing of this loop in the crystal structure. Interestingly, this loop shows high B-factor values in the crystal of p14TCL1 (data not shown), its dynamics being less affected by the packing of the dimer. Finally, the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein appear very flexible in both the solution and the crystal, even though the very first residues show slightly lower Bfactors, certainly due to the presence of intermolecular interactions in the crystal structure. or by the very high resolution (800 MHz) 2D NMR homonuclear experiments, the solution structure of p13MTCP1 has been considerably improved with regard to our previous model. This improvement does not limit itself to the finding of an helical segment in the long flexible loop joining the two -motifs, as was already observed in the crystal structure, but it also allows a better resolution of the -barrel itself, as indicated by the very low rmsd values. Thus, the final structures conform better to the stereochemical standards and an accurate comparison can be done with the crystal structure. P13MTCP1 is a compact molecule belonging to the  class of proteins with 50% of its residues arranged into -strands. Not surprisingly, the structure in solution is virtually identical to that found in the crystal, with rmsd values of 0.9 Å and 1.43 Å for backbone atoms and all heavy atoms, respectively. Most of the differences have been related to the packing of the protein in the crystal. Indeed, the stability of such a structural motif is subject to severe geometric rules (Murzin, 1994a,b), such that minimal variations are expected between the crystal and the solution structure. Interestingly, although the two structures are roughly similar everywhere else, a different conformation is observed for strand C in the structure of p14TCL1 , due to residue insertion, which has been correlated to the formation of a stable dimer both in solution and in the crystal. In addition to a similar structure, p13MTCP1 has also very similar dynamic behavior in solution and in the crystal, but the 15 N relaxation data analysis brings out details on the time scales of the motions which are not attainable from the inspection of the B-factors. Thus, the high B-factor values observed for residues in the two -pleated loops emerging from the barrel indicate an increased flexibility in the crystal. In solution, these loops also appear flexible, but motions on a very different time scale are involved in their intrinsic dynamics. Additional sub-nanosecond motions are detected in the loop emerging from the C­D -sheet, and a significant decrease of the generalized order parameter indicates little restriction for these internal motions. On the opposite face of the barrel, the loop supported by the G-H -sheet undergoes a slow hingemotion, on the µs to ms time scale. The consistence of the data with the Lipari­Szabo model indicates that internal motions in this loop are fast, on the ps time scale, and highly restricted, as supported by S2 values close to 1. Similarly, the relaxation analysis shows that the dynamics of the long flexible loop joining the two -motifs is very complex. In addition to nearly unhin-

Discussion Owing to the enhancement of the spectral resolution brought either by the 3D [15 N,1 H] NMR heteronuclear experiments recorded on the 15 N-labeled protein

229 dered sub-nanosecond motions, strong conformational exchange contributions participate to the movement of this loop in solution. These exchange contributions are especially strong in the helical segment, which also exhibits high B-factor values in the crystal. The two -pleated loops delimitate a large concave surface on the exterior of the -barrel, with a striking richness in solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues (45% of the solvent-exposed residues), which might be a possible interaction surface. This has been postulated in our previous work on the basis of the high sequence homology between p13MTCP1 and p14TCL1: among 22 solvent-exposed residues on this surface on p13MTCP1, 14 are conserved in p14TCL1, including all the hydrophobic residues. The conformational flexibility observed in the loops may promote the docking process by thermally induced motions. This surface is considerably enlarged in the dimer of p14TCL1. NMR diffusion experiments (unpublished results) have shown that the dimer is stable in solution: it possibly constitutes the physiological active form of the protein. If the proteins of this family are targeted toward similar molecular partner(s), this raises the question of a possible dimerisation of p13MTCP1 under physiological conditions or when complexed to its partner. Note that the large insertion (17 residues) at the exit of strand C in p14TCL1b precludes any safe conclusion about the possible dimerisation of this new member of the p13MTCP1 oncogenic protein family. With only 33% identity, the long flexible loop has been previously discarded as being involved in an interaction common to p13MTCP1 and p14TCL1 . Nevertheless, it is rather disconcerting that a similar region of this loop, without any sequence homology, is involved in a similar helical structure in the two proteins. Possibly, this region could play a similar role in the function of the proteins: the different amino acid composition might bring some specificity to the interaction. Without any information on the molecular partner(s) of these oncogenic proteins, any proposal of a putative binding site or mode of action remains very speculative. But we think that the proposal of a binding site on the surface of the barrel is more realistic than the role of transport proteins suggested by Fu et al. (1998) or Pekarski et al. (1999) from a superficial resemblance with the structure of proteins in the lipocalin protein family (Banaszak et al., 1994). Beyond the fact that the -barrel found in p13MTCP1 (or p14TCL1) adopts a different topology, geometrical considerations about this barrel demonstrate that these oncogenes are not related to this protein family. Indeed, the -barrel found in p13MTCP1 belongs to the category `filled barrel' (Murzin, 1994a,b), with an optimal and dense packing of the hydrophobic side-chains within the barrel. Since there is no cavity in the inside of such a barrel, there is no way for the binding of, even a small, hydrophobic ligand. The high conservation of the amino acids involved in the -barrels of p13MTCP1 and p14TCL1 is presumably only due to the presence of this common scaffold: these residues, which contribute to the stability of the -barrel, have been selected through evolution in addition to those that are responsible for the specific (unknown) function.
