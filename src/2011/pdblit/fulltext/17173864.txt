NOD1 is a cytosolic signalling host pattern-recognition receptor composed of a caspase-activating and recruitment domain (CARD), a nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) and leucine-rich repeats. It plays a crucial role in innate immunity by activating the NF-B pathway via its downstream effector the kinase RICK (RIP2) following the recognition of a specific bacterial ligand. RICK is recruited by NOD1 through interaction of their respective CARDs. Here we present the high resolution NMR structure of the NOD1 CARD. It is generally similar to other CARDs of known structure, consisting of six tightly packed helices, although the length and orientation of the last helix is unusual. Mutations in both the NOD1 and RICK CARD domains were assayed by immuno-precipitation of cell lysates and in vivo NF-B activation in order to define residues important for CARD­CARD interaction and downstream signalling. The results show that the interaction is critically dependent on three acidic residues on NOD1 CARD and three basic residues on RICK CARD and thus is likely to have a strong electrostatic component, similar to other characterised CARD­CARD interactions.

Introduction
The survival of a multicellular organism to pathogenic attack depends on the sensing of microbialderived products and the subsequent initiation of immune system responses. Innate immunity relies on the specific recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NBD or NOD) proteins are a family of intracellular PRRs that recognize PAMPs, which results in activation of pro-inflammatory pathways.1­3 Most NOD family members contain a

modular tripartite domain organization comprising a carboxy-terminal ligand-recognition domain containing leucine-rich repeats, which is likely involved in the recognition of PAMPs, a centrally located NOD typically consisting of a NACHT domain (domain present in NAIP, CIITA, HET-E, TP-1) and several NACHT-associated domains (NAD) and an amino-terminal effector-binding domain (EBD) that can be a caspase-activating recruitment domain (CARD), a baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat (BIR) or a pyrin domain (Figure 1(a)). The NBD mediates the selfoligomerization of the protein that is a prerequisite for inducing signal transduction via the EBD.4 The NOD family member, NOD1 (or CARD4) acts as a cytosolic receptor for the diaminopimelatecontaining GlcNAc-tripeptide muropeptide found mostly in Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycans.5,6 It has been shown to activate and regulate proinflammatory pathways by mediating the activation of the nuclear factor NF-B7,8 and also triggering interleukin-1 secretion by procaspase-1 activation.9 NOD1 has been specifically implicated in the

Figure 1. Domain structure of NOD proteins and NMR spectra of NOD1 CARD. (a) NOD proteins display a modular organization in three functional domains: an amino-terminal effector domain (EBD), a centrally located nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NBD), and a carboxy-terminal ligand-recognition domain (LRD). The EBD nature is diverse, and EBDs may be composed by capase-activating and recruitment domains (CARD), pyrin domains (PYD) or baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeats (BIR). The NBD consists of a NACHT domain, followed in most cases by an uncharacterized carboxy-terminal extension termed NAD for NACHT-associated domain. The LRD is composed of a variable number of leucin-rich repeats (LRRs). (b) 1H-15N HSQC correlated spectrum recorded at 800 MHz with assignments.

response to Helicobacter pylori,10 which is a leading cause of peptic ulcers and gastritis in humans. Recently NOD1 polymorphisms have been associated with eczema, atopic asthma and inflammatory bowel disease.11,12 NOD1 activates NF-B via its downstream effector, a serine-threonine kinase named RICK (also known as RIP2 or CARDIAK), through homotypic CARD­CARD interactions.7,8 The CARD 13 is a protein­protein interaction domain belonging to the death domain superfamily, which also includes the death domain, death effector domain and pyrin domain.14,15 It allows the assembly of multi-protein complexes and plays a key role in different cellular processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, cancer or auto-inflammatory diseases most notably by activating caspase-1, caspase-8 or NF-B.16 The CARD structure comprises a bundle of six antiparallel helices, similar to other death domain superfamily members, and the atomic structures of several CARD domains have been determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR: Apaf-1 CARD,17­19 procaspase-9 CARD,19 RAIDD CARD,20 Iceberg.21 In addition to its interaction with NOD1, RICK engages in homotypic CARD­CARD interactions with seven other CARD-containing proteins; NOD2 (CARD15),22 CARD6,23 caspase-1,24 BIR2/cIAP1,25 BIR3/cIAP2,25 Bcl1026 and COP.27,28 NOD2 is another NOD family member implicated in the same signalling pathway as NOD1. Its EBD comprises two CARD domains, both of which are required to recruit RICK.22 Point mutations or truncations in NOD2 can give susceptibility to certain inflammatory diseases

such as Crohn's disease,29 a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract or Blau syndrome,30 another granulomatous disorder. Here we report the expression and purification of a soluble form of the CARD domain of NOD1 and determination of its solution structure by high resolution NMR. Furthermore, by mutagenesis studies using co-immunoprecipitation we have identified residues in NOD1 and RICK CARDs critical for the interaction between NOD1 and RICK, and by NFB activation assays in mammalian cells, residues in the NOD1 CARD that are important for its signalling function. These results support the notion that the interaction between NOD1 and RICK CARDs has a critical electrostatic component, similar to that found in other CARD­CARD interactions such as between the Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 CARDS.19 Understanding the structural basis of the CARD­CARD interaction between NOD1 and RICK is of considerable importance for a better knowledge of the activation mechanism of NOD proteins and for potential exploitation of the CARD­CARD interface as a target for therapeutic intervention and treatment of inflammatory diseases.31

Results
Structure determination A number of constructs encompassing the human NOD1 CARD domain were tested for high levels of soluble protein expression. A construct spanning

162 residues 15 to 106 showed a very low expression level and solubility, whereas one comprising residues 15 to 138 gave high yields of very soluble protein. This suggests that some residues in the region 107­138 are important for protein stability. As extensive crystallisation trials proved negative, the 15­138 construct was used for structure determination by NMR spectroscopy. Nearly 95% of the backbone chemical shifts could be assigned for the residues 15­110, which is largely well-structured. Residues 111­138 were not included in the structure determination as they are located in an unstructured carboxy-terminal extension where unfavourable dynamic properties resulted in a low signal to noise in the NMR spectra (see below). The assigned 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of NOD1 CARD shows a good dispersion of the 1 H-15N cross-peaks (Figure 1(b)). However, the spin systems of L100 and R101 preceding P102 were not observed in the triple resonance spectra used for backbone assignment. The relaxation study detailed below shows that these residues are located in the region N91­G108, which undergoes conformational or chemical exchange suggesting that the NMR signals of L100 and R101 are broadened by intermediate exchange. Moreover, in an overlapping region D95­S110, three sets of resonance signals are present for each residue in the NMR spectra. This is particularly visible in the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum of the aromatic residues (Figure 1(c)). For example, W103 exhibits one major conformation and two less populated conformations with an abundance of approximately 75, 15 and 10% (see resonances obtained for its H1 or H2, Figure 1(c)). W103 is the only tryptophan residue present in the NOD1 CARD domain, which allowed an easy assignment of its side-chain resonances based on the use of the characteristic frequency range. The CGCB chemical shift difference of P102 shows that this residue exists in the trans conformation and that cis-trans isomerization of this proline is therefore not the cause of the conformational heterogeneity of the carboxy-terminal region. The structure of the predominant conformation of the CARD domain of NOD1 was defined by a total of 1235 NMR-derived distance constraints (AQUA analysis32). The complete structural statistics and rmsd values for the top 40 energy-minimised structures are presented in Table 1. Structure overview The solution structure of NOD1 CARD (Figure 2(a)) consists of an arrangement of six -helices closely packed around a hydrophobic core including in particular hydrophobic residues highly conserved amongst members of the CARD family known for interacting with RICK (Figure 2(b)). Helices 2­5 form an antiparallel four-helix bundle with helix 6 and helix 1 positioned on the top of helix 5 and helix 4, respectively, and crossing each other. Helix 1 is interrupted by a severe kink at residue Q26

neighbouring the conserved R27 and consequently is divided into two smaller helices, helix 1 (aminoterminal to the kink) and helix 1 (carboxy-terminal to the kink) with helix 1 parallel to helix 4 and helix 1 parallel to the N-terminal part of helix 6. The hydrophobic surfaces of helices 3, 5 and 6 pack against those of helices 1, 2 and 4 to form the hydrophobic core. Helix 6 (residues 93­107), which is distinctly curved at position 100, has an unusual orientation for CARD domains (see below) and therefore we present more details relating to it. It is less well defined than the other helices, with a backbone rmsd of above 1 Å compared to 0.3­0.5 Å for helices 1 to 5. This is due to a combination of effects, notably the conformational heterogeneity in the region 95­100 highlighted above, the fact that residues 100 and 101 are not visible in the NMR spectra preventing the local structure in the middle of the helix to be precisely defined and the fact that residue 102 is a proline, well-known to distort helices. Nevertheless, although fewer long-range nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) restraints are observed for helix 6 compared to the rest of the protein, there is sufficient information to define with confidence the orientation of its carboxy and amino-terminal parts. For instance eight NOESY restraints are observed between the aminoterminal part of helix 6 (residues Q92 to A96) and the

The four structures have the same orientation. Helices 1 to 6 are numbered 1­6 on NOD1 CARD structure. (d) Detail of the structural alignment of the N and C-terminal regions of NOD1 (magenta), Iceberg (gold) and Apaf-1 (blue) CARDs highlighting the major deviations of NOD1 CARD from more prototypical CARDs.

carboxy-terminal part of helix 5 (T88 and L89), ten between the carboxy-terminal part of helix 6 (W103 and F109) and the amino-terminal of helix 1 (Q21, L22 and S25), and one between the amino-terminal extremities of helix 6 (A96) and helix 1 (L30). The close proximity of the amino and carboxy-terminal regions of the domain (e.g. F109 with Q21) is perhaps responsible for the better stability and solubility of the longer construct used in this work

as opposed to the shorter construct ending at residue 106. The known structures most similar to NOD1 CARD found using the DALI server33 are those of Iceberg21 (Z-score = 6, rmsd of 3 Å for 81 aligned C), RAIDD20 (Z-score = 5.3, rmsd 3.8 Å for 85 aligned), procaspase-919 (Z-score = 5.0, rmsd 3.5 Å for 82 aligned) and Apaf-117 (Z-score = 5.0, rmsd 3.5 Å for 82 aligned). These structural similarities are

164 however lower than that observed between CARD domains generally (e.g. procaspase-9/Apaf-1 Zscore = 14.9, procaspase-9/iceberg Z-score = 10.9, Apaf-1/iceberg Z-score = 11.1). Thus while the overall topology is similar, NOD1 CARD differs notably in the conformation of some of the inter-helical loops and consequently the length and orientation of some of the helices (Figure 2(c)). The main difference concerns helix 6, which begins earlier and is longer in NOD1 CARD than in the other CARDs considered. The longer helix is supported by the chemical shift index of the C, C and CO resonances. Most significantly the final direction of the extended helix 6 differs considerably from in other CARDs, as shown in Figure 2(d). Compared to other CARDs, the connection between helices 1 and 2 is altered and also that between helices 5 and 6. The carboxyterminal extension of helix 6 after the central kink leads it to cross over helix 1 and points in the opposite direction to the carboxy-terminus of other CARD domains. However it should be borne in mind that helix 6 is more flexible than the five others as described below by 15N relaxation analysis.

N relaxation and backbone dynamics

N spin relaxation data contain information on the time-dependent fluctuations of individual backbone N-H bond vectors. High 15N{1H}-NOE values (Figure 3) observed for the structured part of the domain shows that the region composed of the six helices is rather rigid in the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. However the lower 15N{1H}-NOE values seen in the short amino-terminal peptide chain preceding the first helix and the 30 residue long carboxy-terminal tail of the protein is characteristic of flexible random coil. More precisely, the

high 15N transverse relaxation rate of residues V115 and S116 shows the presence of conformational or chemical exchange in this region of the tail, whereas the low 15N{1H}-NOE values seen for the 14 last residues of the construct shows that the second half of the carboxy-terminal tail is highly flexible in the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. To analyse the measured relaxation data of the folded region of the protein (excluding the rather long carboxyterminal tail) we used the Lipari-Szabo model-free approach34,35 in combination with a description of rotational diffusion anisotropy.36 Residues with overlapping 1H-15N correlation peaks or weak cross-peak intensities due to chemical exchange were removed from the analysis. The R2/R1 value analysis leads to a fully anisotropic diffusion tensor with an overall correlation time of the molecule (c) of 7.6( ± 0.1) ns, an anisotropy of 1.24 ± 0.03 and a rhombicity of 1.4 ± 0.25. This anisotropy is rather large for the relatively small size of the protein, but the extended and unstructured carboxy-terminal tail of the protein is the likely cause of this. The generalized order parameters S 2 obtained for the 61 remaining residues are displayed in Figure 4(a). The colour scheme reflects increasing order parameters, i.e. degree of local flexibility along the protein backbone, from red (more flexible) to yellow, light blue and blue (more rigid) in the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. Residues located in the helices 1 to 5 exhibit mostly small amplitude motions except for L44, D54 and I60, three residues being located in the same vicinity of the protein. The rest of the more dynamic NH vectors are located in loops or at the extremities of helices. Residues exhibiting chemical or conformational exchange in the microsecond to millisecond time scale range are colour coded in red (Figure 4(b)). R27 and H33 located at the extremities of helix 1 as well as V75 located at the C-terminal of helix 4 are involved in such slow events as well as the majority of the residues of the last helix. A model for the NOD1/RICK CARD­CARD interaction Convincing evidence for the direct interaction between NOD1 and RICK CARDs has been provided by two groups using co-immunoprecipitation experiments8 or a yeast two-hybrid screen.7 These experiments clearly show that the CARD domains of NOD1 and RICK are both indispensable for the interaction of NOD1 with RICK, independently of the kinase domain of RICK and of the NBD and LRR domains of NOD1. A direct CARD­CARD interaction between NOD1 and RICK is thus likely to be critical for NOD1 signalling. Studies of CARD­CARD binding in the Apaf-1/ procaspase-919 and RAIDD/caspase-220 systems led to the conclusion that tight binding is achieved by electrostatic interaction of oppositely charged surfaces on each partner, which would guide the initial docking, reinforced by hydrogen bonds and

hydrophobic interactions. For example, the Apaf-1/ procaspase-9 CARD­CARD crystal structure, shows that an acidic patch of Apaf-1 interacts with a basic patch of procaspase-9.18,19 We therefore examined whether there were similar patches of charged residues on the NOD1 CARD surface. As shown in Figure 5, the NOD1 surface includes a basic patch composed of K24, K67, R69 and K70 belonging to helices 1 and 4, which is surrounded by two acidic patches on its left and on its right (Figure 5(a)). The left patch consists mainly of acidic residues of helices 5 and 6 in particular E80, E84, D95, D99 and E106 whereas the right one (Figure 5(b) and (d)), which is the most negatively charged, is composed of acidic residues from helices 2 and 3: D42, D48, E53, D54 and E56. As shown in Figure 5(c) and (d) there are also a number of hydrophobic residues, mainly from helices 5 and 6, associated with this most negatively charged acidic patch. We also constructed a homology model of the RICK CARD to identify putative surface features. The amino acid sequence conservation in the CARD family is generally low (Figure 2(b)) although the known structures present a high degree of structural homology. Procaspase-9 CARD structure19 was used as a template for RICK CARD homology modelling because amongst the CARD domains of known structure, it has the highest sequence identity with RICK CARD (about 20%). Moreover, it is the only other CARD domain known so far that interacts with NOD1 CARD,8 suggesting that the procaspase-9 CARD and RICK CARD interactions with NOD1 might share common features. The modelled RICK CARD also has distinct positively and negatively charged surfaces. The most extensive basic surface of RICK (Figure 5(f) and (h)) comprises K443 and R444 from the turn between helices 1 and

1, Lys480 from the turn between helices 3 and 4, R483 and R488 from helix 4. The acidic patch of the modelled RICK CARD contains primarily residues from helices 3 and 5 (Figure 5(e)). We next asked the question as to whether there is an acidic patch of NOD1 CARD that interacts with a basic patch of RICK CARD or vice versa? Like Apaf-1, NOD1 is able to bind procaspase-9. When over-expressed, NOD1 promotes caspase-9-induced apoptosis through CARD­CARD interactions. 8 Both the CARD and the NBD are essential for NOD1 to activate procaspase-9, 8 similarly to Apaf-1.37,38 This suggests that NOD1 may interact with procaspase-9 by a mechanism similar to Apaf-1. Thus we hypothesised that in both the NOD1/procaspase-9 and the NOD1/RICK interactions, it would be the basic patch of procaspase-9 or RICK that interacts with the acidic patch of NOD1. Moreover, the NOD1 CARD acidic patch contains a number of hydrophobic residues (Figure 5(c) and (d)) potentially able to interact with those in the basic patch of RICK (Figure 5(g) and (h)), as observed in the Apaf-1/procaspase-9 CARD­ CARD complex.19 Published mutational analyses of the double CARD of NOD2, another NOD family member interacting with RICK and implicated in the same signalling pathway as NOD1, reinforce this hypothesis. Firstly the NOD2 loss of function mutant E69K corresponds to residue E53 in NOD1 CARD.39 Mutations A106V, L145P and F161I in NOD2 CARD reduce or even abolish the interaction with RICK.39 The corresponding residues in NOD1 CARD structure are either conserved hydrophobic residues or residues juxtaposed to hydrophobic conserved residues (Figure 2(b)) and they are all located in the acidic patch (Figure 5(c) and (d)).

(h) Ribbon drawing of the RICK CARD model with the relevant side-chains highlighted (same orientation as in (f) and (g)).

In order to identify residues potentially involved in the interaction, we constructed a crude docking model for the NOD1 and RICK CARDs based on the known structure of the Apaf-1/procaspase-9 CARD­CARD complex.19 In accordance with our hypothesis, we superimposed NOD1 CARD on Apaf-1 CARD and RICK CARD on procaspase-9 CARD structures, respectively. In the resultant model, the acidic -helices 2 and 3 of NOD1 CARD form an antiparallel four-helix bundle with the basic -helices 1 and 4 of RICK CARD. Five acidic residues of NOD1 CARD (D42, D48, E53, D54 and E56) are found at the putative interaction surface. Of these E53 and E56 are surface-exposed, whereas D42 and D54 make intra-molecular interactions and are not in an optimal configuration for interacting with RICK CARD. However in our structure of NOD1 CARD, the side-chains of D42, E53 and E56 show significantly higher rmsds than all other sidechains of residues belonging to helices 2 and 3, suggesting that they could flexibly adapt during complex formation. D42 and E56 correspond to D27 and E41 from the acidic patch of Apaf-1 and D27 and neighbouring E40 are necessary for Apaf1 binding to procaspase-9.19 Four basic residues of RICK CARD (R444, K480, R483 and R488) are found at the putative interaction surface. Of these, R444 and R488 are conserved basic residues in the CARD family corresponding to R13 and R56 in

procaspase-9 CARD, two residues known to be indispensable for Apaf-1 binding.19 Identification of residues in the NOD1 and RICK CARDs critical for their interaction and for NOD1 signalling To test our hypothesis, we first tried to express and purify RICK CARD with the aim of characterising the NOD1-RICK CARD­CARD interaction in vitro. The least unsatisfactory construct was of residues 432 to 540 of RICK but the expression level was low and the resulting protein was extremely poorly soluble, tending to aggregate. Thus it was not possible to obtain enough soluble RICK CARD to try characterising the CARD­CARD by biochemical and biophysical experiments, e.g. by NMR chemical shift mapping experiments. We therefore turned to mutational analysis using full-length proteins to define NOD1 and RICK CARD residues functionally important for binding and signalling. We constructed and analysed 17 mutants in full-length NOD1 protein and eight mutants in fulllength RICK protein (Figure 6(a)). All mutations were in the CARD domains with several of them concerning the exposed and/or conserved acidic residues for NOD1 or basic residues for RICK mentioned above. To determine which NOD1 mutants still interact with RICK, we carried out immuno-precipitation

167 tions, presumably not involved in the interface. Three NOD1 point mutants E53K, D54K and E56K, all exposed residues in the major acidic patch of the CARD domain, did not co-immuno-precipitate with RICK (Figure 6(b)). These residues thus play a crucial role in mediating the interaction between NOD1 and RICK, probably by promoting the CARD­CARD binding. Consistent with this, the NOD1 D54A-E56K-I57A triple mutant does not

experiments in which NOD1 and RICK proteins were transiently co-expressed in HEK293T cells (Figure 6(b)). Immuno-blotting experiments revealed that all NOD1 mutants were expressed as levels similar to those of wild-type NOD1. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that RICK protein interacts with NOD1 point mutants D48K, I57A and K67A as efficiently as for wild-type showing that the CARD domain is robust to certain muta-

168 bind wild-type RICK protein. NOD1 R69E mutant, in the basic patch of NOD1, shows a greatly reduced ability to interact with RICK (Figure 6(b)). In our structure, R69 forms a salt-bridge with D73, this likely being a critical stabilising feature of the CARD fold as both residues are highly conserved amongst members of the CARD family (Figure 2(b)). Thus it is possible that the mutation R69E does not affect directly the interaction with RICK, but rather destabilises the overall protein fold. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the R69E NOD1 CARD protein is degraded when expressed in bacteria under conditions in which the wild-type NOD1 CARD is highly over-expressed and stable (data not shown). That the basic patch of NOD1 CARD is unlikely to be involved in the RICK interaction is supported by the finding that the K67A mutation does not affect RICK binding. Our results show that L40A, D42K and L44A single point mutants are able to bind RICK as wild-type and V41A with reduced affinity. However double mutants L40A-D42K and D42K-L44A and the triple mutant L40A-V41AD42K exhibit an impaired ability to interact with RICK. These four residues form a cluster adjacent to the acidic residues E53K, D54K and E56K (Figure 7(a)), which, as the mutational effects are only exerted in combination, likely forms a peripheral part of the interaction surface. We note that the NOD1 mutant V41Q shows a good ability to bind RICK, whereas it has been previously reported to abolish the interaction. 8 This difference may be explained by the fact that in this study conditions were used that give more sensitivity for detection of slightly impaired interactions. In the previous study, the binding of the wild-type NOD1 protein appeared itself very weakly and the binding of V41Q may not have been detectable in the conditions used. We also investigated which residues of the CARD of RICK are important for binding to NOD1, by cotransfecting HEK293T cells with wild-type NOD1 and mutant RICK proteins. Mutant proteins were expressed at levels similar to or slightly lower than those of wild-type RICK. RICK mutants I469A and E500A were used as positive controls for the

immunoprecipitation experiments as they show a binding ability similar to that of the wild-type RICK protein. We found that RICK mutants R444E, R483E and R488E are unable to bind NOD1 (Figure 6(c)). We therefore conclude from these studies that the basic residues R444, R483 and R488 of RICK CARD and acidic residues E53, D54 and E56 from NOD1 CARD are key residues required for the NOD1­ RICK interaction, suggesting that they could mediate an electrostatic interaction between the two CARDs. NF-B activation assays We also identified amino acid residues in NOD1 CARD that are functionally important for NOD1 signalling by determining the ability of certain NOD1 mutants to activate the transcription factor NF-B using a luciferase reporter NF-B assay (Figure 6(d)). Control NOD1 mutants, D48K, A52S and K67A, unimpaired in their interaction with RICK, activate NF-B as for wild-type NOD1 protein. On the other hand, mutants displaying an impaired ability to bind RICK, such as E53K, D54K and E56K, fail to activate NF-B. Interestingly, L44A, I57A and V41Q mutant NOD1 proteins, which have been shown to bind RICK, exhibit a greatly reduced activation of the signalling (Figure 6(d)). L44 and I57 are two solvent-accessible hydrophobic residues located close to the NOD1 acidic patch. The possible significance of these hydrophobic residues is discussed below.

Discussion
Previous results have clearly shown that the interaction between NOD1 and RICK is dependent on their CARD domains.7,8 By co-immunoprecipitation experiments it was shown that residues 374­540 of RICK, which contains its C-terminal CARD, were sufficient to bind full-length NOD1.8 Similarly residues 1­648 of NOD1 (i.e. lacking the LRRs but containing the N-terminal CARD) were able to bind

full-length RICK protein, whereas constructs containing only the LRRs or both the LRRs and NBD (residues 126­953) were not. Using an aminoterminal fragment of NOD1 encompassing the CARD (residues 1­145) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human breast cDNA library, RICK was independently identified as an interacting partner.7 Follow up experiments showed that RICK CARD alone (residues 435­540) was sufficient for binding

the bait and that full-length RICK but not a construct (residues 1­435) lacking the CARD was able to coimmunoprecipitate NOD1 in mammalian cells. The smallest regions shown to interact by these experiments were 1­145 of NOD1 with 435­540 of RICK. Although co-immunoprecipitation does not in itself imply a direct interaction, taken all together these results support the existence of a direct interaction between NOD1 and RICK CARDs. Nevertheless it

170 cannot be ruled out that additional cellular factors participate in or modulate the interaction. We have determined by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy the three-dimensional solution structure of a construct comprising residues 15­138 of NOD1. We find that residues 15­110 form a welldefined structure (although with some heterogeneity towards the carboxy-terminal end of this region) with a CARD-like fold, whilst residues 111­138 are unstructured in solution. Although the NOD1 CARD is structurally homologous to other known CARD structures, with its Greek key six-helix bundle fold, it presents some unique features, notably the length and orientation of helix 6. In the case of the well-characterised CARD­CARD interaction between Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, interactions between oppositely charged surfaces are important for binding.19 The NMR structure shows that the surface of NOD1 exhibits distinct acidic and basic patches and this is also probably true for the RICK CARD, based on a homology model. We have therefore performed mutations in the CARD domains of NOD1 and RICK in order to test the hypothesis that residues in these patches are important for the CARD­CARD interaction and for signalling. Our mutagenesis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments on full-length proteins show that complementary sets of charged residues, acidic residues from CARD helices 2 and 3 for NOD1 and basic residues helices 1 and 4 from RICK, are crucial for the NOD1/RICK CARD­CARD interaction. This provides experimental evidence that the NOD1-RICK CARD­CARD interaction is indeed similar to that between the CARDs of procaspase-9 and Apaf-1, in having an important, but not exclusive (see below), electrostatic component and suggests that our model for the complex is globally correct. However, the particular residues employed in each case do not always correspond (Figure 7), showing that the details of the model will have to be amended. R444 and R488, two basic residues of RICK CARD necessary for the interaction with NOD1 CARD, correspond to R13 and R56 in procaspase-9 that were shown to be indispensable for the interaction with Apaf-1 CARD19 (Figures 2(b) and 7(b) and (d)). On the other hand, R483, the third RICK basic residue necessary for the interaction with NOD1 CARD corresponds to R51 in procaspase-9 (Figure 2(b)), which however is not involved in the interaction between Apaf-1 and procaspase-9. Similarly, the important acidic residues that we have identified in the NOD1 CARD differ from those in Apaf-1 CARD. For example, Apaf-1 D27, which is necessary for the interaction with procaspase-9,19 corresponds to NOD1 D42 whose single point mutation does not affect RICK binding nor NF-B activity as shown by our co-immunoprecipitation and activity experiments. NOD1 D54 and E56 residues, which are necessary for the interaction with RICK, correspond to E39 and E41 residues in Apaf-1 CARD. E39 and E41 are not involved in the interaction with procaspase-9 CARD. We note that

NOD1 CARD Solution Structure

the three important acidic residues that we have identified in NOD1, E53, D54 and E56, are frequently conserved in CARDs that interact with RICK, including RICK itself (Figure 2(b)). This suggests that all these CARDs could interact with RICK by a similar mechanism implicating these particular residues and also the possibility that the RICK CARD could form homo-dimers. In addition, we have also identified several NOD1 CARD residues important for activation of the NFB signalling pathway. These include not only the three acidic residues important for RICK binding, but also two hydrophobic residues, L44 and I57, located in or close to the acidic patch of NOD1, but which did not affect co-immunoprecipitation with RICK. These could be required for the precise formation of a functional CARD­CARD interaction, although contributing less to the binding, or they could interact with other regions of RICK than the CARD domain or even other components of the signalling pathway, not all of whose components have been identified.40 A significant role for hydrophobic interactions (in addition to electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds) was noted in the Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 complex structure, which were proposed to add specificity to the interaction after the initial electrostatic docking.19 Our data suggest a similar role for hydrophobic interactions in the functional NOD1/RICK complex and this is consistent with the fact that the complex remains undisrupted at high ionic strength, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation experiments performed using buffers containing 1 M salt (data not shown), similar to the stability in 2 M salt of the Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 complex.19 In this connection, we note that the recent crystal structure of the CARD and NOD domains of Apaf-1 in its inactive, ADPbound form has given the first structural insight into the activation mechanism of NOD proteins.41 The Apaf-1 CARD domain is observed to pack against the NOD domain using the same interaction surface as previously shown to interact with the CARD domain of procaspase-9, the downstream effector. Thus, by analogy, correct functioning of NOD1 probably requires that its CARD domain interacts with other parts of NOD1 in the inactive form and with RICK in the ligand activated state. In addition the fact that activation induces oligomerisation of NOD1 and possibly of RICK adds another level of complication. Clearly more structural studies are required on intact NOD1 and in complex with RICK to more precisely define the conformations and interactions involved.

Experimental Procedures
Cloning and protein expression of NOD1 CARD The DNA coding for residues 15 to 138 of the NOD1 protein was cloned in the pETM-11 vector (EMBL) between the NcoI and KpnI restriction sites. This vector

NOD1 CARD Solution Structure fuses a cleavable amino-terminal six-residue histidine tag to the expressed protein. NOD1 CARD was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen). The transformed cells were grown either in LB medium for unlabelled NOD1 CARD or M9 minimal medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl (1 g l- 1) for 15N-labelled NOD1 CARD and 15NH4Cl (1 g l- 1) and [13C6]glucose (2 g l- 1) for 15 N-13C-labelled NOD1 CARD. The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C and protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactoside during 5 h at 30 °C. The degree of isotope labelling of the protein after purification was verified to be higher than 98% using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Sample preparation After cell lysis the six His-tag recombinant protein was purified using a Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen) at pH 7.5. The His-tag was removed by overnight TEV protease cleavage at 4 °C. The protein was then run over a fresh NiNTA column to remove any uncleaved protein as well as the His-tagged TEV protease. The eluted NOD1 CARD was further purified to homogeneity using size-exclusion FPLC (Superdex®75; Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mM sodium-phosphate (pH 7), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, a buffer suitable for NMR. The protein was concentrated to approximately 0.5 or 0.8 mM for the unlabelled NOD1 CARD and 1.4 mM for the 15N and 15N-13C-labelled NOD1 CARD used for NMR experiments. NMR spectroscopy All NMR spectra recorded for the structure determination were acquired at 30 °C on Varian INOVA 800 or Varian INOVA 600 spectrometers. For sequential backbone assignment, six standard triple-resonance experiments were performed on the 15N-13C-labelled protein in 95% H2O/ 5% 2H2O: HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH and HNCA. An additional 3D 1H-15N-edited NOESYHSQC spectrum was performed on a 15N-labelled sample of NOD1 CARD in order to identify HN-HN contacts. 1H and 13C aliphatic side-chain assignments were accomplished using a set of five 3D triple-resonance experiments: HBHA(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH, HC(CO)NH and H(C)CHTOCSY in 95% H2O/5% 2H2O plus H(C)CH-TOCSY in 100% 2H2O. The assignment of aromatic side-chain protons was performed using 1H homonuclear 2D NOESY acquired with the unlabelled protein in 95% H2O/5% 2H2O and in 100% 2H2O, and with 3D 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC with the 13 C carrier frequency in the aromatic region acquired using the 15N-13C-labelled protein in 95% H2O/5% 2H2O and in 100% 2H2O. The 1H and 13C assignment completeness for side-chains are 84.96% (1H) and 76.2% (13C). Distance restraints were derived from 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, 3D 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and 3D methyl selected NOESY-HSQC experiments.42 A mixingtime of 100 ms was used for all NOESY experiments. An H-2H exchange experiment was performed at 800 MHz by re-dissolving a lyophilized 15N-labelled sample of NOD1 CARD in 2H2O and following the loss of intensity of labile protons by recording a series of 15N-edited HSQC spectra over 19 h. Amide protons were considered to be involved in a hydrogen bond if signal remained visible 3 h after the exchange. All spectra were processed with NMRPipe43 and analysed using NMRView.44,45 Smartnotebook46 was used for sequential NMR resonance assignment. Structure calculation

171

Only residues 15 to 110 were included in the structure calculations, the remaining part of the protein being more flexible as shown by 15N relaxation analysis and lacking any NOE correlations. Assignments of unambiguous NOEs of the 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and the 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments were done manually. Dihedral angle restraints were generated using TALOS47 based on secondary chemical shifts. Hydrogen bonding restraints were deduced from backbone chemical shifts and from the H-2H exchange experiment analysis. An initial calculation of the structure of NOD1 CARD was performed with the program CNS48 using an extended conformation of the protein and the aforementioned structural restraints. NOE intensities were classified as strong (<2.8 Å), medium (<3.4 Å) and weak (< 5 Å). A total of 1000 structures were calculated and the best in term of energy was used as a starting point for automated NOE assignment of the remaining peaks using the program aria2.0.49 The program MOLMOL50 was used for checking and displaying violations of NMR restraints. The final structure calculation was performed following simulated annealing protocols with CNS51 and using an extended conformation of NOD1 CARD. A total of 1000 structures were calculated and the 40 lowest energy structures were refined in explicit water using CNS. The 40 refined structures obtained were analysed and validated in terms of geometry and restraints violations with the AQUA and PROCHECK-NMR programs.32 Structure representations were made with the program GRASP,52 PYMOL and MOLMOL.50

N relaxation experiments

All relaxation experiments were performed at 30 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 spectrometer using 15 N-labelled samples with a concentration of approximately 0.7 mM. 15 N R1 and heteronuclear 15N{1H}-NOE values were determined as described.53 R1 times were extracted from 14 spectra with different values for the relaxation delay: 0 (2×), 55, 111, 166, 222, 333, 444, 666, 888, 1110 (2×), 1554 and 1998 ms, applying 180° pulses on protons every 5 ms to suppress CSA(15N)/DD(HN) cross-correlated relaxations. 15N R2 relaxation times were extracted from R1 experiments. The R1 experiments were recorded with spin-lock pulses of varying lengths 2, 6 (2×), 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80 (2×), 100, 120, 140 and 160 ms. Relaxation parameters were extracted with the program Curvefit, using a two-parameter fitting and a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the errors. In the R1 experiments, a spin lock field of |NB1|/2 = 1.6 kHz was applied to the 15 N spins to suppress chemical shift and scalar JNH coupling evolution. Transverse relaxation rate constants R2 were then calculated from the measured R1 rate constants, taking into account the frequency offset , using the equation: R1 = cos 2 ()R2+sin2 ()R1 where  = tan- 1(2/NB1). The 15N heteronuclear relaxation rates were interpreted using the program TENSOR2,54,55 which uses the description of molecular diffusion derived by Woessner,36 in combination with the Lipari-Szabo model-free analysis of local flexibility.34 In the model-free approach, internal mobility is characterized using an order parameter S2, which may be interpreted as the amplitude of the motion  http://www.pymol.org/

and a correlation time, i, the characteristic time constant of this motion. The inter-nuclear distance rNH was assumed to average to 1.01, and the chemical shift anisotropy of the 15 N nucleus (//­) was approximated to -170 ppm. Sequence alignments and homology modelling The amino acid sequences of all proteins were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. The sequence alignment in Figure 2(b) was done using ClustalW.56 Coordinates from the CARDs of Apaf-1, procaspase-9, and Iceberg were obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Modelling of the structure of the RICK CARD was performed with the program Modeller8v157 using the atomic coordinates of procaspase-9 CARD. Mutagenesis of NOD1 and RICK Expression plasmid pcDNA3-N-terminal HA-tagged NOD1 (pcDNA3-NOD1-HA)8 and pcDNA3-N-terminal FLAG-tagged RICK (pcDNA3-RICK-FLAG)58 were mutagenised using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate single, double and triple amino acid mutants in the CARD domains of NOD1 or RICK. NOD1 mutants included L40A, V41A, V41Q, D42K, L44A, D48K, A52S, E53K, D54K, E56K, I57A, K67A, R69E, L40A-D42K, D42K-L44A, L40A-V41A-D42K, D54A-E56K-I57A and RICK mutants were R444E, V448A, I469A, K480E, P481A, R483E, R488E, and E500A. The entire coding sequences of all NOD1 and RICK clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting HEK293T cells were co-transfected using the calcium phosphate method with either pcDNA3-NOD1-HA mutants and wild-type pcDNA3-RICK-FLAG or with wild-type pcDNA3-NOD1-HA and pcDNA3-RICK-FLAG mutants as described.8 In each case, three controls were performed: co-transfection with wild-type pcDNA3NOD1-HA and wild-type pcDNA3-RICK-FLAG, or cotransfection with wild-type pcDNA3-NOD1-HA and empty pcDNA3 or wild-type pcDNA3-RICK-FLAG and empty pcDNA3. Empty pcDNA3 was used to keep constant the amount of DNA used. HEK293T cells were harvested 20 h after transfection and lysed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer.59 Lysates were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and then immunoprecipitations were carried out using Rec-protein G-Sepharose®4B conjugate (Zymed). Total lysates and immuno-precipitated products were resolved by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect NOD1 proteins or mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) to detect RICK proteins. A reference extract from HEK293T cells transfected with the wild-type NOD1 or RICK cDNA were included in all immunoblotting experiments to compare the expression of mutant and wild-type NOD1 and RICK proteins. NF-B activation assays HEK293T cells (4 × 104) were co-transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen) using 5 ng pBVIx-luc,60 10 ng pCMV-gal,8 400 ng of pcDNA3 plasmid for the control or 5 ng of wild-type or mutant

NOD1 CARD Solution Structure NOD1 plasmid plus 395 ng pcDNA3 to keep constant the total amount of transfected DNA.

NK-B assays were performed in triplicate.
