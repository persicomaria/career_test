Ste11, a homologue of mammalian MAPKKKs, together with its binding partner Ste50 works in a number of MAPK signaling pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ste11/Ste50 binding is mediated by their sterile a motifs or SAM domains, of which homologues are also found in many other intracellular signaling and regulatory proteins. Here, we present the solution structure of the SAM domain or residues D37­R104 of Ste11 and its interactions with the cognate SAM domain-containing region of Ste50, residues M27­Q131. NMR pulse-field-gradient (PFG) and rotational correlation time measurements (tc) establish that the Ste11 SAM domain exists predominantly as a symmetric dimer in solution. The solution structure of the dimeric Ste11 SAM domain consists of five well-defined helices per monomer packed into a compact globular structure. The dimeric structure of the SAM domain is maintained by a novel dimer interface involving interactions between a number of hydrophobic residues situated on helix 4 and at the beginning of the C-terminal long helix (helix 5). The dimer structure may also be stabilized by potential salt bridge interactions across the interface. NMR H/2H exchange experiments showed that binding of the Ste50 SAM to the Ste11 SAM very likely involves the positively charged extreme C-terminal region as well as exposed hydrophobic patches of the dimeric Ste11 SAM domain. The dimeric structure of the Ste11 SAM and its interactions with the Ste50 SAM may have important roles in the regulation and activation of the Ste11 kinase and signal transmission and amplifications through the Ste50­Ste11 complex.

found in all eukaroytic cells.1 MAPK-mediated signal transduction networks have been shown to transmit many extracellular stimuli from the cell surface to the nucleus and to elicit a wide variety of cellular responses including protein synthesis, cell proliferation, differentiation and changes in morphology. The MAPK modules typically consist of three kinases; a MAPK, a MAPKK (also known as ERK or MEK), and a MAPKKK (or MEKK). In response to plasma membrane originated signals, components of these kinase modules are activated sequentially through phosphorylations. Initially, an

1072 upstream and membrane-associated kinase, also called MAPKKKK, activates a downstream kinase, the MAPKKK. This activated MAPKKK phosphorylates the downstream MAPKK (a kinase with dual serine/threonine and tyrosine specificity) that in turn activates the MAPK.2,3 Once activated, the MAPK phosphorylates a number of transcription regulators leading to transcriptional activation of stimuli-specific genes. Therefore, regulation of these kinase modules is critical for signal transmission, pathway specificity and kinetics of signaling responses. Classically, such regulation is often imparted by protein interaction domains that may either work in cis (part of the same kinase) or in trans (mediated by other proteins). These protein interaction domains function through their unique abilities to recognize a variety of binding partners, effectively controlling the signaling cascades.4,5 The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used extensively as a model organism for functional analyses of MAPK signal transduction cascades. These studies revealed that there are up to six MAPK modules in yeast, regulating pheromone responses, filamentation, high-osmolarity growth (HOG), cell wall integrity and sporulation.6,7 Among the three kinase components of the MAPK modules, the MAPKKK Ste11 is critical, since it is shared by almost all the pathways and activates many other downstream kinases.6 Previous studies using the yeast two-hybrid system and analyses of interaction domains have demonstrated that Ste11 has a modular architecture composed of several functional domains. The N-terminal half of the protein is involved predominantly in regulatory interactions and is implicated in binding to an adaptor protein Ste508,9 and to a scaffolding protein Ste5.10,11 The interaction between Ste11 and Ste50 is required for the activation of the Ste11 kinase.12­14 Sequence alignments and in-depth genetic and biochemical characterization have established that relatively short N-terminal segments containing SAM (sterile alpha motif) domains are responsible for the interactions between Ste11 and Ste50.14­16 The SAM domain has now been established as a widespread "protein interaction" domain of w70 residues involved in diverse functions ranging from signal transduction to transciptional repression.4,17 Extensive structural analyses of a number of SAM domains have demonstrated that these domains can mediate homo or hetero oligomerizations using different modes of association.18­20 Extensive homooligomerization of SAM domains leads to formation of helical filaments from the polycomb group of proteins and the Ets family of transcriptional repressor proteins (TEL),21,22 while monomeric solution structures have been deduced for the SAM domains from proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, i.e. Ets-1, GABPa, Erg,23,24 and from the tumor suppressor protein p73.25 Very recently, a monomeric solution structure of the Ste50 SAM domain consisting of residues 27­108 has been reported.26 SAM domains have also been shown to interact with other protein motifs, such as

PDZ domains,27 SH2 domains,28 Cdc2 family of kinases29 and the MAP kinase, Erk 2.30 Apart from protein­protein interactions, SAM domains of the post-transcriptional regulator Smg protein from Drosophila melanogaster have now been shown to even bind RNA.31,32 Here, we have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the dimeric SAM domain of Ste11 by use of NMR spectroscopy. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the solution structure of a dimeric SAM domain. The interactions between the SAM domains of Ste11 and Ste50 were further studied by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pull down and NMR H/2H exchange experiments. Our results suggest that the dimerization of the Ste11 kinase may be nucleated by the unique dimeric structure of the Ste11 SAM domain and the dimeric Ste11 SAM may further associate with Ste50 to initiate signaling events through the yeast MAPK cascades.

Results
Resonance assignments of the SAM domain of Ste11 Figure 1 shows a heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of the D37-R104 (labeled as from residue 1­68) domain of Ste11, indicating backbone HN and 15N cross-peaks of individual residues. A single peak for each residue in the well-dispersed HSQC spectrum suggests a uniquely folded structure for the SAM domain of Ste11. Assignments for the backbone HN, 15N, 13Ca, 13 b C and 13C 0 resonances were achieved by a combined analysis of the triple-resonance HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH and HNCO spectra.33 The HSQC peaks were identified for all residues except for L7 within the protein domain as well as for some residues from the N-terminal affinity-tag. The HSQC peaks for the first few residues at the N terminus, D1 to D6, were significantly sharper and more intense than others. On the other hand, relatively broad cross-peaks were observed for residues V32, T33 and I37. The CaH and CbH proton resonances and side-chain carbon and proton resonances were assigned from the HBHA(CO)NH and (H)CCH-COSY34 spectra, respectively. Quaternary association of the Ste11 SAM domain Despite having a well-dispersed 1H­15N HSQC spectrum, the Ste11 SAM domain exhibited linewidths of 25­30 Hz for almost all the amide protons, which are significantly larger than expected for a protein of w70 residues. HSQC spectra acquired at various concentrations ranging from 1.2 mM to 0.1 mM (not shown) had no measurable differences either in the line-widths or in the chemical shifts of 1HN and 15N resonances. 15 N relaxation data indicate that most of the

The SAM protein fragment covers residues 37­104 of the Ste11 kinase (numbering according to Swiss-Prot accession number P23561, but labeled here as residues 1­68). The spectrum was acquired in a 10 mM potassium phosphate solution with 300 mM NaCl (pH 5.8) at 288 K. Horizontal lines connect cross-peaks arising from side-chain amides of the Asn/Gln residues. The peaks labeled by ! were unassigned and were from the additional tag residues at the N terminus of the expressed protein.

residues do not experience significant conformational mobility (Figure 2). Oligomerization states of the Ste11 SAM domain were probed by use of pulse-field-gradient (PFG) NMR measurements of hydrodynamic radii (RH) and by estimating the overall rotational correlation time (tc) using 15N relaxation data (Figure 2).35­37 The average tc of the Ste11 SAM domain was estimated from the ratio of 15 N NMR T1/T2 (see Materials and Methods) only for the motionally restricted residues, i.e. residues F9­F66 (Figure 2). The relative RH and the average tc of the Ste11 SAM domain were estimated to be ° 21.7(G0.2) A and 10(G0.2) ns, respectively (Figure 3). ° A very similar RH (w20 A) was obtained from dynamic light scattering experiments. Both the RH and tc of the Ste11 SAM are considerably higher than those of proteins of similar sizes (w60­70 residues) but close to the group of proteins of 130­ 150 residues (Figure 3). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the Ste11 SAM domain exists predominantly as a dimer (i.e. with 2!68 amino acid residues) in solution. Furthermore, the dimeric Ste11 SAM domain appears to be stable over the concentration range of 0.1 mM to 1 mM, as demonstrated by similar rates of intensity change of the proton NMR signals in response to strengths of pulse-field-gradients (inset of Figure 3(a)). The

dimerization of the Ste11 SAM domain established by NMR spectroscopy also corroborates with the recent results obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation.26 Solution structure of the dimeric SAM domain of Ste11 The solution structure of the dimeric Ste11 SAM domain was determined from a large number of intra-subunit and inter-subunit NOE constraints (Figure 4 and Table 1) along with dihedral angles and hydrogen bond constraints (Table 2). Structure calculations were performed in a step-wise fashion. Initially, nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) constraints were used to generate the global fold of the monomeric structure. NOE constraints that were not compatible with the monomeric structure were further identified and utilized to calculate the dimeric structure along with inter-subunit NOE constraints obtained from 13C/12C-filtered experiments (Figure 4 and Table 1). Figure 5(a) shows a superposition of 15 low-energy structures thus obtained. Each subunit of the Ste11 SAM domain consists of five well-defined helices: helix 1, F9­E16; helix 2, L23­Q28; helix 3, E34­K38; helix 4, K42­A47; and helix 5, I53­S65, packed into a compact

The left panel (a) shows inter-subunit NOEs originating from the 13C-labeled methyl protons of the unique Ala (Ala47) in the sequence of the Ste11 SAM domain. The right panel shows inter-subunit NOEs originating from the 13C-labeled CdH3 methyl protons of Ile46. Assignments (as labeled) were made only for singlet peaks (i.e. only protons attached to 13C signals detected along F1). Other assigned inter-subunit NOEs are listed in Table 1.

globular fold (Figure 5(b)). The helices are connected by well-defined short loops or turns that do not sample varieties of conformations. The first six residues (D1­D6) from the N terminus do not adopt any regular secondary structures and appear to be unstructured. These residues are mainly characterized by a few sequential NOEs without any longrange NOEs to the other helices and therefore were excluded from structure calculations. The last two residues, Q67 and R68, from the C terminus were also found to be flexible. Among the five helices, helix 1, helix 2, helix 4 and helix 5 are in regular a-helical conformations whereas helix 3 is a 310 helix. The compact structure of this highly helical protein is determined by an antiparallel orientation of helices 1, 2 and helices 4, 5. The hydrophobic core of each subnuit is made by residues V10, F13, L14, I17, C19, Y22, F26, L31, I37, L40, L45, L48, V50, I59,

S63, and F66 from all the helices and even the loop regions. In particular, the side-chains of aromatic residues F13, Y22, F26 and F66 have stacking interactions, whereby the aromatic rings of F13 and F26 are sandwiched by the aromatic rings of F26 and F66, F13 and Y22, respectively (Figure 5(c)). Apart from the stacking interactions, the rings of F13 and F26 make many intimate contacts with the side-chains of other apolar residues, i.e. respectively with I37 and I59 along with residue S65 and the alkyl side-chain of K62 and with V10, L31, I37, L48, and I59. In addition, a potential long-range salt-bridge interaction can be seen between K62 from helix 5 and E16 of helix 1. The oxygen atom of the ­OH group of Y22 and the carboxylate of D55 appear to be facing each other forming a hydrogen bond (Figure 5(c)). This interaction is shielded by the aliphatic side-chains of residues L48 and V50.

1077 between I46 0 and residues L57 and I53 and between A47 0 and I53 (Figure 6(a)). Packing among nonpolar residues is also observed between residue I53 and I53 0 and between residue L60 and L60 0 from H5 and H5 0 , respectively (Figure 6(a)). These hydrophobic interactions are further complemented by potential inter-subunit salt bridges between residues D41 0 and R61 and between D43 0 and K42 (Figure 6(b)). Inter-subunit NOEs correlating residues D41, K42 and D43 in 13C/12C-filtered experiments (Table 1 and Figure 4) clearly indicate involvement of these residues in the dimer interface. Additional polar residues located in or close to the interface include N51, G54, S63 and K64. Some hydrophobic residues from the N terminus of the Ste11 SAM domain, F9, L12, L23, I27, V32 and Y39, are, however, not involved in the dimerization and remain exposed (Figure 6(c)). Interestingly, the Ste11 SAM domain shows a highly asymmetric charge distribution (Figure 6(d)). One face of the dimer is largely neutral, whereas the opposite face of the dimer contains almost all the charged residues (Figure 6(d)). The interface region of the Ste11 SAM dimer therefore has patches of positive charges that may interact with the highly negatively charged Ste50 SAM domain (which has a calculated pI of 4.19). Defining residues of the Ste11 SAM domain involved in interactions with Ste50 A GST-tagged Ste50 fragment, residues 27­131, pulled down the untagged Ste11 SAM onto a glutathione-Sepharose column preloaded with the Ste50 fragment. The stoichiometry of binding was determined by the gel shift assay, whereby the Ste11 and Ste50 fragments were mixed in various proportions and the bound and free forms were separated by native gel electrophoresis (Figure 7(a)). At a concentration ratio of 1 : 1, there was no free Ste11 SAM, however the free Ste50 fragment could be observed. The binding was almost saturable at a ratio of 2 : 1 for the concentrations of the Ste11 and Ste50 fragments, respectively, indicating formation of a potentially trimeric species. Interestingly, further increases in the concentrations of the Ste11 SAM did not produce a well-resolved band for the free Ste11 SAM, instead a smearing between the free species and the complex was apparent (Figure 7(a)), suggesting a fast dissociation of the complex or possible formation of more than one type of molecular complexes. A recent independent investigation also demonstrated a 2 : 1 ratio binding for the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains by use of sizeexclusion chromatography experiments.26 Taken together, these results suggest that the dimeric structure of the Ste11 SAM domain is involved in interactions with the Ste50 SAM domain. The interactions between the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains were studied in further details by monitoring changes in the 1H­15N HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled Ste11 and Ste50 fragments with the addition of unlabeled Ste50 or Ste11 samples,

Both residues are packed against the aromatic ring of Y22 (Figure 5(c)). Interestingly, the three-dimensional structures of various SAM domains determined to date by X-ray,18,20­22 and NMR19,23­26 all contain similar topology consisting of five helices. The dimeric Ste11 SAM domain is maintained by interactions between residues of H4 (H4 0 ) and H5 0 (H5) from the C-terminal part of the SAM domain, orienting each sub-unit in a parallel fashion (Figures 5 and 6). The dimer interface of the Ste11 SAM domain is predominantly hydrophobic with interactions between I44 0 and residues L57 and L60,

respectively. Dramatic binding-induced resonance broadenings led to almost complete disappearance of the HSQC peaks for all the concentration ratios of both the SAM domains (spectra not shown). Resonance broadening could not be improved by variation of experimental conditions, including temperature, addition of salts, and changes of pH, and even using different lengths of the Ste11 and Ste50 fragment constructs. The structural characteristics of the Ste11 and Ste50 complex were therefore assessed by use of H/2H exchange measurements, monitored in a solublizing solvent (i.e. dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) after exchange with 2H O.38 Figure 7(b) and (c) shows the 1H­15N HSQC 2 spectra (in DMSO-d6) of the 15N-labeled Ste11 SAM domain after experiencing four and eight hours of

native H/2H exchange while in complex with the Ste50 fragment. Remarkably, there are many more amide protons of the Ste11 SAM domain protected against exchange in the complexed state than in free (dimeric) form (Figure 7(d)). In particular, exchange of the amide protons of residues F9, C19, T20, V32, K42, D43, I53, G54, D55, S63, S65 and F66 was retarded only when the Ste11 SAM domain was in complex with the Ste50 SAM. These residues showed only very weak protection against exchange in the free dimeric state of the Ste11 SAM domain. Indeed, residues S63, S65 and F66 are located at a highly positively charged C-terminal region of helix 5 (Figure 8) at the peripheral of the interfacial areas of the dimeric structure (Figure 6(a) and (c)). Apart from protection of the backbone

1079 five characteristic helices. However, the quaternary association between the subunits of the Ste11 SAM domain utilizes different types of interfaces from those of the only known dimeric structure of the EphA4 receptor SAM domain determined by X-ray crystallography. The lobster-claw-shaped dimeric structure of the EphA4 SAM is stabilized by interactions between residues situated at the N-terminal strand preceding helix 1 and residues following helix 5. The critical hydrophobic residues of the EphA4 SAM that are involved in the subunit contacts do not exist in the corresponding sequence positions of the Ste11 SAM domain (Figure 8). For instance, residues L940, V944, M972 and M976 were demonstrated to be involved in the dimerization of the EphA4 SAM domain,20 which in the Ste11 SAM, become E34, K38, F66 and K70, respectively. (It is noted that residue K70 was not included in the SAM domain construct studied here.) Furthermore, the N-terminal strand (P908-E-F-S-A-V-V914) region contains many hydrophobic residues contributing to the dimer interface of the EphA4 SAM structure, but it is very hydrophilic in the sequence of the Ste11 SAM. The corresponding segment of the Ste11 SAM, i.e. residues D37­L43 (NMR numbering D1­L7), is structurally very flexible, as demonstrated by limited chemical shift deviations from random coil

amide protons, the side-chain NH protons of certain Asn/Gln residues of the Ste11 SAM were also found to be well protected against exchange in the Ste11/ Ste50 complex, implying roles of these side-chains in the formation of the complex. In contrast, none of the side-chain NHs of Asn/Gln residues has comparable protection in the dimeric state of the Ste11 SAM domain (Figure 7(d)).

Discussion
A novel dimeric structure of the Ste11 SAM domain In the past few years, several three-dimensional structures of the SAM domains have been determined, which include the monomeric solution structures of the Ste50 SAM domain,26 the EphB2 SAM domain,19 the p73 SAM domain25 and the Ets SAM domain,23 a closed dimeric structure of the EphA4 receptor SAM domain20 and the open polymeric structures of SAM domains from transcriptional repressor proteins TEL21 and ph.22 Each subunit of the dimeric Ste11 SAM domain has a tertiary fold very similar to those of other known SAM domains and a canonical arrangement of the

1081 Specifically, the symmetrical dimer structure of the Ste11 SAM domain uses many residues from the first half of helix 5 of one subunit to pack against residues from helix 4 of the other subunit (Figure 6(a)). Interestingly, the EH-type interface of the ph SAM domain employs similar hydrophobic residues from the N-terminal end of helix 5 (Figure 8).22 On the other hand, the interfacial hydrophobic residues from helix 4 of the Ste11 SAM domain are quite unique to this particular sequence (Figure 8).16 Since the dimeric interface of the Ste11 SAM domain is essentially created by docking of two helices, i.e. H4 and H5 0 , we term this new mode of SAM­SAM interaction as an "HH-type" interface. This HH-type binding effectively shields helix 5 from engaging potential EH/ML-type interactions in polymeric SAM structures. 21,22 However, the positively charged C-terminal end of helix 5 in the dimeric Ste11 SAM is largely exposed and, together with loop 3 residues, still available (Figures 5(b) and 6(c) and (d)) for potential interactions with the negatively charged Ste50 SAM. Three-dimensional structures of SAM domains determined to date, together with that of the dimeric Ste11 SAM, therefore indicate that non-conserved hydrophobic residues across the SAM domain sequences may play a major role in creating different types of dimeric/oligomeric states, leading to unique functions of each of the SAM domains.

values, the existence of only sequential NOEs and low heteronuclear NOE values (Figure 2(c)). Three-dimensional structures of oligomeric/polymeric SAM domains of EphB2,18,19 TEL21 and ph22 have revealed four different types of interacting surfaces that can be formed by these SAM domains. The head-to-tail polymerization of the TEL and ph SAM domains occurs through interactions of the so-called mid-loop (ML) and end helix (EH) surfaces.17,21,22 The oligomeric form of the EphB2 SAM domain was proposed to be sustained by interlocking interactions between the N-terminal segment of each monomer and by "back-to-back" interactions, referred to as a "b-region" interface,18 i.e. antiparallel packing of the monomer surfaces formed by helix 5 and loop 3. Thanos et al.18 suggested that the EphB2 SAM domain may form an asymmetric dimer first, which may further oligomerize through back-toback interactions. These structural studies to date also established that the long helix 5 (H5) is commonly used by SAM domains in forming different types of oligomeric interfaces. Topologically, the novel dimeric structure of Ste11 SAM appears to be related to the back-to-back or b-region interface observed for the EphB2 SAM domain.18 Instead of antiparallel packing, the Ste11 SAM dimer is formed by parallel interactions between helix 4 of one monomer subunit and helix 5 of the other subunit, generating a new type of binding interface.

Boxed residues are those contributing to EH-interfaces in the polymeric structures of TEL and ph SAM domains, as described.21,22 Circled residues are those lining the ML surfaces in the polymeric SAM structrures.21,22 Similar labels are also employed for related interfacial residues in the putative dimer structure of the EphB2 SAM19 as well as for the dimeric structure of the Ste11 SAM (Figure 6(a) and (b)). The positions of the helical secondary structures of the Ste11 SAM are indicated on the top of the sequence.

Structural characteristics of the heterocomplexes between the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains A recent investigation showed a 2 : 1 stoichiometry for the binding of the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains.26 Our GST-pulldown and native gel shift experiments also demonstrated high-affinity interactions between the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains with a stoichiometry of 2 : 1, indicating that the dimeric structure of Ste11 SAM may bind a monomeric unit of the Ste50 SAM domain. Interestingly, biophysical analysis showed a different mode of binding between the SAM domains of Byr2 and Ste4, homologues of Ste11 and Ste4, respectively, from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.39 The isolated Byr2 and Ste4 SAM domains interact at 1 : 1 ratio forming a simple low-affinity heterodimer. However, extension of the Ste4 SAM domain to include a leucine-zipper motif (Ste4 SAM-LZ) was shown to both augment the affinity of the

interaction with the Byr2 SAM and shift the binding stoichiometry to 3 : 1 (Ste4:Byr2). A similar leucine zipper motif has not been shown to exist in Ste50 of S. cerevisiae, indicating potentially different signaling mechanisms between the evolutionarily diversified budding and fission yeasts. We attempted to map the potential interaction residues of the Ste11 SAM with the Ste50 SAM domain by use of H/2H exchange experiments. Increased protections of the backbone amide protons and even the side-chain NH protons of Gln and Asn residues of the Ste11 SAM domain from H/2H exchange suggest the formation of a high-affinity complex between the two SAM domains with significant structural stabilization of the Ste11 SAM domain. H/2H exchange experiments identified two groups of protected or structurally stabilized amide protons in the Ste11 SAM. One group includes the amide protons of residues L12, L14, I17, G18, Q21, F26, I46, L48, L57, and L60, which are protected both by the dimeric structure

1084 and in the Ste11:Ste50 hetero-complex. In addition, the hetero-complex protects these NH protons against exchange for considerably longer times, demonstrating a binding-induced stabilization of the dimeric Ste11 SAM structure. Interestingly, Ste50 SAM binding protected the NH protons of many other residues, including those of residues F9, C19, T20, V32, K42, D43, I53, G54, D55, S63, S65 and F66, from both the N and C termini of the Ste11 SAM domain. Enhanced protections of many of the residues, i.e. K42, I53, G54, L57, L60, S63, S65 and F66, from or around the dimer interface indicate that the binding of the Ste50 SAM domain very likely involves the positively charged extreme C-terminal region from residue R61 to K70 of the Ste11 SAM domain (Figure 8). Retarded H/2H exchange of the N-terminal residues F9, C19 and V32 indicates that the Ste50 SAM may also interact with the exposed hydrophobic surface of the Ste11 SAM dimer (Figure 6(c)). It is, however, not clear whether Ste50 is able to interact with both of the potential binding sites simultaneously. Biological implications In spite of the low sequence homology, structures of all SAM domains determined so far have very similar global topologies. Very interestingly, structural studies to date revealed that individual SAM domains, however, are markedly different in their self-association properties, which may be responsible for their widely varied biological functions. In light of these previous findings, it is highly interesting that the Ste11 SAM domain can assume a stably folded dimeric structure, an observation that may have functional relevance. Previously, yeast two-hybrid analysis40 and co-immunoprecipitation41 had shown that the full-length Ste11 protein has a significant propensity for self-association. The N-terminal SAM domain of Ste11 may be largely responsible for this self-association or potentially the formation of a specific dimer for the full-length Ste11. It has also been demonstrated that the large N-terminal region (residues 1­386) of Ste11 has multi-functional regulatory roles for the C-terminal kinase.12­14 The enzymatic activity of the kinase domain appears to be blocked in an inactive conformation by means of its interactions with the N-terminal regulatory region.14 One may therefore contemplate that the dimerization of a well-folded Ste11 SAM domain may play a dominant role in stabilizing such an inactive conformation of the intact Ste11 protein. Binding of the Ste50 SAM to the dimeric Ste11 may then alter the auto-inhibited "closed" conformation of Ste11, leading to its phosphorylation by the upstream MAPKKKK Ste20. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the Pak1 kinase, a homologue of the MAPKKKK Ste20 (the upstream kinase of Ste11) also exists as a dimer via a separate dimerization domain, arresting the kinase in an inactivated conformational state.42 Several genetic studies have indicated that the adaptor protein Ste50 may play only an auxiliary

Dimeric Structure of Ste11 SAM Domain

role in the pheromone and nutrient starvation (low nitrogen content) signaling pathways. In these pathways, over-expression of Ste11 can partly overcome the mating defect and also restore hyphal growth in Ste50-deleted strains, suggesting that low levels of signaling can still be transmitted without the Ste50 protein.41,43,44 On the other hand, overexpression of Ste50 prolongs the duration of cell cycle arrest and boosts morphological changes in the mating response.9 Therefore, a primary role of Ste50 in signaling appears to enhance and sustain the cellular response to the ligand-mediated signals. Interaction of Ste50 with a pre-formed dimeric Ste11 may therefore also increase the local concentrations of the Ste11 kinase, leading to enhanced phosphorylation of downstream kinases and to amplification of the transduced signals through the Ste11/Ste50 complex.

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification of the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains DNA sequences corresponding to the SAM domains of Ste11 (D37­R104, numbering according to Swiss-Prot accession number P23561) and Ste50 (M27­Q131, numbering according to Swiss-Prot accession number P25344) were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of the budding yeast and cloned into pET14b and pGEX-2T vectors with a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal His6-tag (Qiagen) and GST-tag (Pharmacia), respectively. Both the fragments were over-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS, induced at an A600 nm of 0.6 to 0.7 with 1 mM IPTG, and incubated for 6­12 hours at 25 8C for protein production. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended either in 20 mM Tris­hydrochloride buffer or in phosphate buffered saline (pH 8.0). The cell solution was lysed by sonication and the supernatant was either applied onto a nickel-NTA column for His-tag based purification (Qiagen) or onto a glutathione-Sepharose column for GST-tag (Pharmacia) based purifications. Weakly bound proteins were removed from the column by extensive washing with appropriate buffers. Strongly bound target proteins were eluted from the resins either with 500 mM imidazole or 20 mM reduced glutathione for the Ste11 fragment and Ste50 fragment, respectively. The fusion proteins were digested with thrombin to remove the affinity tags (GST or His-tag). The protein-containing fractions were pooled and extensively dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate solutions, containing 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, NaCl at various concentrations (10 mM to 50 mM and/or 100 mM to 300 mM) adjusted to different pHs (6.8 to 5.0). For the production of uniformly labeled (15N and 15N/13C) proteins, the expressing bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium containing (15NH4)2SO4 or (15NH4)2SO4/[13C]glucose. NMR spectroscopy All the triple resonance NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance-800 spectrometer. Resonances of the Ste11 fragment were assigned using spectra acquired with a 0.8 mM [15N, 13C] doubly labeled sample in an optimized solution condition of 10 mM potassium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM

calculations, only unambiguous long-range NOE constraints were used to generate a low-resolution fold for the monomeric structure. Distance restraints for the dimer interface were obtained from inter-subunit NOEs observed in 13C/12C filtered NOESY spectra50,51 and NOEs incompatible with the monomeric fold extracted from conventional 15N- and 13C-edited 3-D NOESY spectra (Table 1). For calculation of dimeric structures, two sequences were connected by a flexible Gly-linker, computationally breaking the symmetry of the dimer. Dihedral angle restraints were calculated from chemical shift index.52 Hydrogen bond constraints were determined from H/2H exchange experiments. Hydrogen­deuterium exchange experiments For native-state hydrogen exchange, lyophilized powder of the 15N-labeled Ste11 SAM was directly dissolved in 2H2O and multiple short-duration 1H/15N HSQC spectra (lastingwone hour each) were acquired over a period of 24 hours. For H/2H exchange of the complex between the Ste11 and Ste50 domains, 15N-labeled Ste11 SAM and unlabeled Ste50 SAM were mixed at equimolar concentrations in 10 mM potassium phosphate solution containing 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol at pH 6.5 and lyophilized. The lyophilized powder was dissolved in 2 H2O and subsequently lyophilized after exchange for predefined durations. The 2H2O exchanged and lyophilized samples were then dissolved in 100% DMSO-d6 and HSQC spectra showing protected amides of the 15Nlabeled Ste11 SAM were acquired at 313 K. The 1H/15N HSQC spectrum of fully protonated and 15N-labeled Ste11 SAM in 100% DMSO-d6 was assigned using a combination of HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB spectra of 15N/13C-labeled Ste11 SAM. The assignments of residual HSQC peaks after H/2 H exchange were accomplished through comparison with full-protonated 1H/15N HSQC of the Ste11 SAM domain in 100% DMSO-d6. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Native gel binding assays were carried out by mixing various concentrations of the Ste11 SAM samples with a fixed concentration of the Ste50 SAM domain (4 mM) in 10 mM potassium phosphate solution (pH 6.8), ensuring the Ste11 SAM:Ste50 SAM molar ratios to be in the range of 1 : 1 to 9 : 1. After two hours of incubation, samples were electrophoresed using Amarsham Biosciences PhastGele system. GST-pulldown

b-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide and 10% 2 H2O at pH 5.8. The temperature of all the experiments was typically set to 288 K. Backbone 15N, HN, 13Ca/b, C 0 resonances were assigned by a combination of HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH and HNCO spectra.33 The CaH and CbH resonances and the aliphatic side-chain carbon atoms and protons were mainly assigned using HBHA(CO)HN33 and (H)CCH-COSY spectra34, respectively. The aromatic side-chain protons and carbon atoms were identified by analyses of 3-D NOESY and 2-D (Hb)Cb(CgCd)Hd and (Hb)Cb(CgCdC3)H3 spectra.45 All the chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to that of DSS. To detect inter-subunit NOEs, doubly labeled and unlabeled Ste11 SAM domains were mixed in equimolar concentrations and incubated at 15 8C for 16 hours for subunit mixing prior to NMR experiments. Correlation time (tc) measurements The correlation time of the Ste11 SAM domain was estimated using the equation:46 tc Z f½6ðT1 =T2 Þ K 71=4g1=2 =UN 2p where T1 and T2 are the mean longitudinal and transverse relaxation times for the structured residues (residues 9­ 66) of the Ste11 SAM domain, and UN is the Larmor frequency of 15N at the field strength of 80.016 MHz used here. The 15N longitudinal and transverse relaxation time constants, T1 and T2, respectively, were determined by collecting a time series of 15N-HSQC spectra with sensitivity enhancement.47 Relaxation measurements were performed on an 800 MHz spectrometer at a temperature of 288 K. For T1 measurements, the spectra were collected with relaxation delays of 5, 40, 80, 130, 210, 330, 470, 630, 800 and 1000 ms, with repeat experiments at 40 ms and 130 ms for error estimations. For T2 measurements, data were acquired with delays of 14.4, 28.8, 43.2, 57.6, 72.0, 86.4, 100.8, 115.2, 129.6, 144.0 and 158.4 ms with duplicate points at 43.2 ms and 72.0 ms. The delay between 180 pulses in the Carr­Purcell­Meiboom­Gill (CPMG) pulse train for T2 measurements were fixed to 0.9 ms. A total of 2048 complex data points with 96 or 128 complex increments were collected for the relaxation experiments. The relaxation rate constants were determined by fitting the cross-peak intensities to a monoexponential function. Heteronuclear 1H­15N NOEs were determined as the ratio of the peak intensities with and without proton saturation. NMR structure calculations The dimeric structure of the Ste11 SAM was calculated iteratively by use of Cyana 1.0.6. NOESY peaks were identified from the three 3-D 15N­1H HSQC-NOESY, 13 C­1H HSQC-NOESY and aromatic 13C­1H HSQCNOESY spectra using an in-house automated assignment program.48 The NOESY cross-peaks were categorized as strong, medium and weak with upper-bound distances of ° ° ° 3.0 A, 4.0 A and 5.0 A, respectively, while all the lower limits were set to the van der Wallas contact distance ° (1.8 A). Appropriate pseudo-atom corrections were applied to the upper bound distances for methyl, methylene groups and aromatic ring protons. The peudo-atom approximations were replaced at later stages of structure refinement by the summation method to improve the accuracy of NOE distances involving degenerate protons.49 At the first round of structure

An approximately 80 mM solution of GST-tagged Ste50 SAM was incubated with the glutathione-Sepharose beads in a buffer solution of 20 mM Tris­hydrochloride (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. The beads were thoroughly washed with the same buffer to remove unbound proteins. A 1 ml aliquot of a 40 mM solution of the Ste11 SAM in 20 mM Tris­ hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0), was applied onto the beads. The mixture was incubated for two hours and loaded into a BioRad column. The beads were washed with the assay buffer four times followed by elution of the bound proteins with the assay buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione. Pooled protein fractions (4 ml) were dissolved in the sample loading buffer (Tris/SDS (pH 6.8), glycerol, b-mercaptoethanol, and Commassie blue G-250)
