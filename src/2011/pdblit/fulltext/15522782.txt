Dis-assembly lines: the proteasome and related ATPase-assisted proteases Peter Zwickl*, Wolfgang Baumeister* and Alasdair Steven
Self-compartmentalizing proteases, such as the proteasome and several prokaryotic energy-dependent proteases, are designed to act in the crowded environment of the cell. Proteins destined for degradation are recognized and unfolded by regulatory subcomplexes that invariably contain ATPase modules, before being translocated into another subcomplex, the proteolytic core, for degradation. The sequential actions effected on substrates are reflected in the linear arrangement of these subcomplexes; thus, the holocomplexes are organized as molecular disassembly and degradation lines.

to obtain homogeneous preparations. This lability is attributable primarily to the 19S component, whose complexity -- it is built of at least 17 distinct subunits -- poses a further challenge, exacerbated by its lack of symmetry. In this review, we summarize some recent advances that deepen our understanding of the structure, assembly and function of the 20S proteasome, but the main emphasis is on properties of the 19S particle. We also develop a comparison between proteasomes and simpler, but functionally related, complexes of bacterial descent.

20S proteasomes
Occurrence and subunit composition of 20S proteasomes

As the number of sequenced genomes grows, a progressively clearer picture of the species distribution of proteasomes is emerging. In general, it appears that proteasomes are ubiquitous and essential in eukaryotes; ubiquitous, but not essential in archaea [2]; and rare and nonessential in bacteria [3], in which other energy-dependent proteases abound (to date, genuine bacterial proteasomes have been identified only in actinomycetales [4]). Typical archaeal proteasomes, for example, from Thermoplasma acidophilum, are built from single species of  and  subunits, although, more recently, duplicated genes encoding additional - or -type subunits have been identified in some cases [5]. Similarly, proteasomes from actinomycetales, for example, Mycobacterium, Streptomyces and Frankia, are composed of single  and  subunits [3,6,7], except for Rhodococcus erythropolis, which has two subunits of each kind [8]. Yeast proteasomes are composed of seven distinct -type subunits and seven distinct -type subunits. In higher eukaryotes, -interferon induces the exchange of three -type subunits for three related -type subunits [9]. Despite these differences in complexity, the architecture of 20S proteasomes is highly conserved [10··].
Structure and function of 20S proteasomes

Introduction
In eukaryotes, the 26S proteasome is the central protease in the energy-dependent degradation of proteins via the ubiquitin pathway. This quintessential molecular machine, with a cumulative mass of more than 2.5 MDa, comprises two subcomplexes -- the 20S core particle and the 19S regulatory particle. The core particle performs the actual proteolysis, whereas the 19S particle recognizes and unfolds substrates and delivers them for degradation [1]. These activities are coordinated in a manner reminiscent of an industrial assembly line acting in reverse: in this case, the starting material -- a protein targeted for degradation -- is a complex entity that is sequentially dismantled, unfolded and rendered to fragments; as this program proceeds, the substrate passes from site to specialized site within the complex. The 20S proteasome has been characterized in great detail, whereas relatively little is known about the 19S regulator. Structural analysis of the complete 26S proteasome is hampered by its instability, which makes it notoriously difficult

The 20S proteasome is barrel-shaped, with a diameter of 11 nm, a height of 15 nm and a mass of 700 kDa. The barrel is a bipolar stack of four seven-membered rings, the two outer rings being formed by  subunits and the two inner rings by  subunits. As most prokaryotic proteasomes have single species of both subunits, they form homomeric rings, whereas eukaryotic proteasomes contain heteromeric rings formed by their seven distinct - and -type subunits [10··]. The central  rings enclose a cavity, approximately 5 nm in diameter, that houses the active sites: this inner compartment is a key structural feature common to all self-compartmentalizing proteases so far characterized (for a recent review, see [11]).

In prokaryotic proteasomes, the proteolytic active site includes the N-terminal threonine of the  subunit [12], which is exposed after autocatalytic removal of its propeptide [13]. Only three of the seven eukaryotic  subunits, namely 1, 2 and 5, have an N-terminal threonine, resulting in only six active sites per proteasome [14]. A mutational and crystallographic study of yeast proteasomes found that the inactive -type subunits, 3, 6 and 7, cannot be rendered active by introducing canonically active residues, including Thr1 [15·]. Thus, additional changes are necessary to allow the inactive subunits to adopt a fold that is conducive to proteolysis. Mutational studies and analyses with peptide and protein substrates demonstrated that the three active subunits have different specificities, that is, chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activity [16·,17·]. Nevertheless, the nature of all the active site residues is canonical, as predicted [12]. More recently, a cyclical `bite­chew' model for protein breakdown by the 20S proteasome was suggested, based on the discovery of mutual allosteric regulation of the chymotrypsin-like and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing active sites [18·].
Assembly pathway

eukaryotes, acquired the 20S proteasome by horizontal gene transfer from a host organism [21]. The human 7 subunit forms a ring-like complex when expressed alone and a heteromeric complex when co-expressed with its neighbors, 6 and 1 [22], implying that it has an important role in assembly. The propeptides of the  subunits are processed during their assembly into 20S proteasomes [23,24]. The first characterized intermediate of 20S proteasome assembly was the 300 kDa or 13S complex, which consists of all the  subunits and a subset of  subunits (2, 3 and 4) [25,26]. Incorporation of the remaining  subunits (1, 5­7) triggers dimerization and concomitant processing of the propeptides, yielding fully assembled active proteasomes [25,26]. In yeast, a protein called Ump1p acts as a chaperone in the processing of the 5 propeptide and is thereafter degraded by the proteasome [27·]. Mutational and structural analysis showed that another function of the propeptides, besides driving assembly of the 20S core, is to prevent the N-acetylation of the N-terminal catalytic threonine residues, which would result in inhibition of the active subunits [15·,24,28·].
Mode of degradation and the size of products

The assembly of 20S proteasomes from R. erythropolis has served as a model for bacterial proteasome assembly in general. Their two -type and two -type subunits assemble into active proteasomes when a single  and a single  subunit are co-expressed in any of the four possible combinations [8]. The two  subunits are translated as precursors with propeptides of 65 and 59 residues. Individually expressed, both the  and  subunits remain monomeric and -type precursors remain unprocessed; however, when mixed, they assemble immediately. This suggests that the first intermediate is a heterodimer of an  subunit and a -subunit precursor. To date, the earliest intermediate actually demonstrated is the half-proteasome, composed of one ring each of the  subunits and -subunit precursors. Halfproteasomes remain inactive, even when the  propeptide is deleted, indicating that active sites form only after the dimerization of half-proteasomes. The  propeptides are not essential for assembly, but their absence retards proteasome formation [19]. They can exert their function whether covalently attached at the N terminus or added as free peptides. The co-expression of  subunits and -subunit precursors that are unable to cleave their propeptides yields preholo-proteasomes -- fully assembled particles in which the propeptides fill the central cavities and the antechambers [20]. Preholo-proteasomes are considered to be the final intermediate; their docking triggers the autocatalytic processing of the propeptides and active site formation. The cleaved propeptides are degraded in a processive manner, like substrate proteins [20]. In many respects, the assembly pathway of Rhodococcus proteasomes is similar to that of eukaryotic proteasomes. This is in line with the hypothesis that actinomycetes, many of which are symbionts or parasites in close contact with

Various substrate proteins are degraded in a processive manner by proteasomes from Thermoplasma, yeast and rabbit muscle [17·,29,30]. The generated products are between 3 and 30 amino acids in length, with an average of 7 to 8 residues, independent of the number, specificity or spatial arrangement of the active sites [17·,30,31].

Structure and function of the 26S proteasome
The 19S regulatory subcomplex prepares protein substrates for degradation by the 20S core. The regulator is involved in the recognition and binding of substrate proteins, deubiquitination, unfolding and translocation into the core subcomplex. Translocation is thought to be coupled to the gating of the axial entry channel into the proteolytic cavity.
Three-dimensional reconstruction by electron microscopy

Some progress was made recently in elucidating the structural organization of the 26S proteasome. A threedimensional model of the 26S proteasome from Drosophila embryos was obtained using electron microscopy in conjunction with image reconstruction [32··]. This analysis revealed a rather flexible linkage between the 19S regulator and the 20S core, described as a `wagging-type' relative movement, that is influenced by the presence or absence of Mg­ATP. The images analyzed were of particles immobilized by adsorption to a carbon film and it may be that more complex movements occur under physiological conditions. The density map of the 19S regulator revealed a porous structure that does not immediately suggest a path for a protein substrate to follow en route to the core.

Macromolecular assemblages

proteasomes led to the structural dissection of the 19S regulator into two subcomplexes, the `lid' and the `base' [33··] (Figure 1). Deletion of the 19S regulator subunit Rpn10 yields 26S proteasomes from which a complex of eight subunits, called the lid, can be dissociated at high salt concentrations. Independently, the lid subcomplex was isolated as a free particle from human erythrocytes and was shown to have the same subunit composition [34]. Interestingly, the eight subunits of the lid share significant sequence similarity with the eight subunits of the COP9 signalosome, a regulatory complex with kinase activity in mammals and plants that has been implicated in signal transduction [34­37]. Thus, the lid and the signalosome appear to have evolved from a common ancestor into molecules with distinct functions. The second subcomplex, the base, remains associated with the 20S core under the above-mentioned conditions: it is built from six functionally nonredundant ATPases (Rpt1­6) [38·] and the two largest subunits (Rpn1 and Rpn2) of the 26S proteasome [33··]. The proteasome­base complex is deficient in the degradation of ubiquitinated
Figure 1

substrates, but is still effective in the ATP-dependent degradation of nonubiquitinated substrates. Thus, the lid links the machinery for energy-dependent protein degradation -- the core­base complex -- to the ubiquitin system, which confers specificity.
Chaperone-like activity of the base

In a related study, it was demonstrated that the base of the 19S regulator has a chaperone-like activity, that is, it could bind and refold denatured citrate synthase in an ATPdependent reaction [39··]. This was a surprising finding, because the function of proteasomal ATPases was thought to be the opposite, namely unfolding of substrate proteins for degradation by the core particle [40]. Possibly, its lack of ubiquitin allowed the citrate synthase substrate to dissociate from the base­proteasome complex and refold, thus escaping the degradation machine. In addition, the Janus-faced base [40] might work in both unfoldase and foldase modes, with the fate of the substrate depending on whether or not the base is complexed with the 20S core. Remarkably, the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is degraded by the 26S proteasome in an ATP-dependent,

but ubiquitin-independent manner, although the protein cofactor antizyme is essential for the recognition of ODC by the 26S proteasome [41]. Energy-dependent unfolding and translocation of ODC into the 20S core is performed in a chaperone-like manner [42].
The modulator

A 220 kDa complex, called the modulator, consists of two proteasomal ATPases (Rpt4 and Rpt5) and the p27 protein, a subunit of the 26S proteasome [43,44]. This modulator enhances the proteolytic activity of proteasomes, most likely by stimulating the formation of doubly capped 26S particles [45]. However, the extra mass of the modulator (220 kDa) was not detected in averaged electron micrographs of supposed proteasome­modulator complexes. As mass of this order should be readily detectable by this technique, it remains unclear whether the modulator forms a stable complex with the 20S proteasome or whether it engages only transiently to facilitate the association of 19S regulators with 20S cores.

Recently, some progress has been made in characterizing VAT from Thermoplasma. Depending on the Mg ion concentration, VAT can act in either an unfolding or a refolding mode [52]. Structurally, VAT is remarkably similar to NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor), another eukaryotic protein involved in membrane fusion. In both VAT and NSF, the two AAA domains (D1 and D2) form hexameric toroids [53,54]. The oligomerization (or D2) domain of NSF consists of a nucleotide-binding subdomain with a Rossmann fold and a helical C-terminal subdomain [55··,56··]. Unlike the similar AAA domains of VAT and NSF, their approximately 20 kDa N-terminal substrate-binding domains are rather divergent; nevertheless, they adopt very similar topologies [48··,49··,57··]. The solution structure of the VAT N-terminal domain reveals two half-domains, with the N-terminal subdomain forming a double  barrel and the C-terminal subdomain forming a  clamp [57··]. In actinomycetes, a gene encoding an AAA ATPase that is distantly related to proteasomal ATPases was identified in the vicinity of the operon for the proteasome subunit genes [4]. The Rhodococcus ATPase forms 600 kDa rings with sixfold symmetry and was consequently dubbed ARC (ATPase forming ring-shaped complexes) [58]. The presence of an archetypal N-terminal coiled coil in ARC is a further indication of a functional interaction with proteasomes.

Prokaryotic proteasome regulators
The 20S proteasome from Thermoplasma was found to degrade only short peptides and unfolded proteins [46]. In the search for the postulated regulatory complex, a 600 kDa ATPase from Methanococcus jannaschii, called PAN (proteasome activating nucleotidase), was identified that is closely related to the eukaryotic proteasomal ATPases [47·]. PAN activates the degradation of protein, but not of peptide, substrates by 20S proteasomes from several archaebacteria and eukaryotes. Image analysis of electron micrographs demonstrated that PAN is sixfold symmetric (P Zwickl et al., unpublished data). One hallmark of proteasomal ATPases is a predicted coiled-coil region at their N termini. Its function remains unclear, but suggestions include involvement in oligomerization, in the interaction between the regulator and the 20S core, and in substrate binding and translocation. For some related AAA ATPases (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities), it has been demonstrated that their N-terminal domains, although adopting distinct folds, do indeed interact with substrates [48··,49··,50,51]. It is puzzling that the occurrence of PAN is not strictly correlated with that of proteasomes. The genomes of T. acidophilum (A Ruepp, personal communication) and Pyrobaculum aerophilum (S Fitz-Gibbon, personal communication) contain the proteasomal  and  genes, but not a PAN homolog. As it is unlikely that these proteasomes can function without the assistance of energy-dependent regulators, there must be some functional homologs; prime candidates in Thermoplasma are VAT (valosine-containing protein-like ATPase from T. acidophilum) and LonH (a Lon homolog), both AAA proteins. LonH shares sequence similarity with the ATPase domain of the Lon protease, but lacks its proteolytic domain. VAT is related to the eukaryotic CDC48/p97 proteins, which are involved in homotypic membrane fusion.

Bacterial ATP-dependent proteases
In bacteria, energy-dependent proteolysis is carried out by multiple systems [1,4,59]. These cells generally contain caseinolytic protease (Clp) and Lon, as well as HslVU/ClpQY proteases, built from a protease (HslV/ClpQ) and an ATPase (HslU/ClpY) component, and, in a few cases, genuine 20S proteasomes. Clp proteases differ from proteasomes in terms of subunit composition and the fold of the protease subunits. Nevertheless, certain features of their architecture and functional organization are compellingly similar (and extend to HslVU/ClpQY) -- most notably, the co-axial stacking of hexameric rings of ATPase subunits on one or both faces of the core protease (Figure 1). Assuming that this resemblance extends to the mode of action (i.e. the `disassembly and degradation' line), Clp proteases serve -- at least, for some phenomena -- as scaled down and simplified models of the proteasome. Lon, on the other hand, has the basic difference that its protease and ATPase domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain. It assembles into a flexible oligomer, reported to be a heptamer in yeast [60·].
Comparative properties of Clp proteases and proteasomes

The core of the modular ClpAP and ClpXP proteases from Escherichia coli is a double heptamer of ClpP subunits, which can associate with the hexameric ClpA or ClpX ATPase complex [61,62]. Sevenfold symmetry was also demonstrated recently for human mitochondrial ClpP [63]. The hollow core of this complex houses its proteolytic

246

sites. The crystal structure of ClpP [64] revealed a subunit fold quite distinct from that of the 20S proteasome [14,65]. In essence, ClpP may be considered to be an analog of the 20S proteasome, but with a different subunit fold and without the outer rings of  subunits. Although its active site, as a serine protease, also differs from that of the proteasome, a threonine protease, it nevertheless contrives to generate peptides of a similar length to the 20S proteasome in processive degradation [66].
Subunit composition

The range of organisms in which homologs of Clp protease subunits have been identified continues to grow and now includes two bacterial viruses [67,68]. Some cases of multiple genes for ClpP have been documented, for example, in Streptomyces coelicolor [69] and Arabidopsis [70]. It will be of interest to learn whether these subunits segregate into homomeric rings, as in E. coli, or whether they combine in heteromeric rings, as in the Rhodococcus 20S proteasome. The ATPases ClpA and ClpX are homohexamers that require nucleotide to be stabilized in the assembled form. The ClpA subunit has two ATPase domains, which, in the hexamer, form two tiers with a cavity between them [71··]. ClpX has a single ATPase domain and forms a single-tiered ring [72].
Specificity

of NSF [55··,56··]. In the D2 hexamer, ATP is bound at the intersubunit interfaces. The absence of cognate sequences in expressed SSD domains of Clp proteases would explain their failure to oligomerize [74··]. In NSF, the binding of ATP by D2 results in oligomerization, whereas D1 -- its other ATPase domain -- hydrolyses ATP. A similar division of responsibilities has been attributed to the two ATPase domains of ClpA, but in reverse order [78]. In the same vein, the substrate-binding domain of NSF [48··,49··] is at the N terminus, in contrast with the C-terminal disposition of the SSD in ClpA. In the absence of protease, but the presence of nucleotide, the ATPases assemble to their hexameric state and can exercise unfolding or chaperonelike activity [79,80··]. As noted above, fully assembled and active complexes have ATPase rings bound on one or both faces of the protease. Thus positioned, they are strategically placed both to control which proteins have access to the channel leading into the proteolytic chamber and to supervise substrate translocation. In the processing of RepA, the substrate may bind either to ClpA [77··] or to preassembled ClpAP complexes, which can remain associated through multiple cycles of degradation [78]. The orientation of the ATPase rings relative to their proteases is yet to be established. In the case of ClpA, it has been suggested that its C-terminal domain binds to ClpP, on the grounds that this domain is most closely related to ClpX, which also binds ClpP [61]. In this orientation, the distal N-terminal domain would be exposed for substrate binding [77··]. On the other hand, the docking of the C-terminal domains on to ClpP may pose steric problems for ssrAdirected substrate binding by SSD domains, unless they are distributed around, rather than on the face of, the distal ring.
Symmetry mismatch

Self-compartmentalization is the principal mechanism whereby proteins that are not specifically targeted for degradation by ClpP or HslV/ClpQ are shielded from their active sites. As with the 20S proteasome, the proteolytic compartment of ClpP is accessible only through a channel that is so narrow (~10 Å) [64] that it may be negotiated only by unfolded polypeptides. Consistent with this scenario, ClpP on its own is capable of degrading peptides with up to about 30 amino acids. The degradation of larger folded protein substrates requires the collusion of an ATPase.
Substrate selection

The presence of multiple energy-dependent proteases in E. coli has been seen as a means of extending the range of substrate specificity, but the system also accommodates some redundancy, as ClpAP, ClpXP and Lon have substrates in common [59,73]. An elegant mechanism has been discovered whereby an 11-residue tag called the ssrA (chromosomal 10Sa gene) becomes appended to the C termini of prematurely terminated proteins. This tag is recognized as a degradation signal by ClpA, ClpX and Lon via homologous sequences in their respective C termini -- their so-called SSD (sensor and substrate discrimination) domains [74··]. ssrA tagging does not, however, cover the full range of substrate recognition mechanisms employed by Clp proteases. For certain phage proteins, for example, the  O protein and the P1 RepA protein, as well as the bacterial SOS response protein UmuD, N-terminal binding has also been documented [75,76,77··].
States of assembly

An intriguing feature of the ClpAP complex is the discordant symmetries of the rings of the ClpP (sevenfold) and ClpA (sixfold) subunits. As these molecules stack axially, there must be a nonequivalent interaction between the respective rings. A similar mismatch apparently occurs in the proteasome at the interface between the 20S core (definitely sevenfold [14]) and the 19S regulator (putatively sixfold) (see Table 1). Comparable mismatches have been observed in a few other systems -- notably, the DNA packaging vertex of bacteriophage capsids and the F1F0 proton transporter. During packaging, the DNA is translocated into the capsid by the terminase (another ATPase) via a connector/portal oligomer embedded in the capsid shell. To date, all connectors that have been convincingly demonstrated to be assembly competent are 12-fold rings that, in their respective capsids, occupy sites of fivefold symmetry. The 29 connector -- the most comprehensively studied such molecule -- has been confirmed as a 12-fold ring by high-resolution atomic force microscopy [81] and crystallographic rotation function

digestion of substrates. In the ClpAP system, the relative angular disposition of the ClpP and ClpA rings has been determined [71··]. This interaction is based on key subunits in both rings. Key status is transferred to neighboring subunits by a small rotation (8°), corresponding to a translational shift of only 4­5 Å at the point of contact (Figure 2), a property that facilitates rotation without separation of the subcomplexes. On the other hand, HslVU/ClpQY complexes assembled in vitro exhibit 6:6, as well as 6:7, symmetry combinations ([92,93]; see Table 1). Lon, whose ATPase and protease domains are covalently linked, inevitably requires equimolarity in active complexes. For questions pertaining to the functional implications of symmetry mismatches for processive, energy-dependent proteolysis, final answers are unlikely to precede further experiments.

analysis [82]. Alternatively, in one case (bacteriophage SPP1), overexpressed connectors have been reported to be 13-fold rings [83] and, in another, bacteriophage T7, to be a mixture of 12-fold and 13-fold rings [84]. It is not yet clear whether the 13-mers are assembly competent: if not, their order of symmetry most likely represents an artifactual consequence of overexpression. Another such mismatch occurs within F1F0 [85], in which the pseudo-threefold F1-ATPase overlies the intramembranous F0 component, which has a much higher order of symmetry (10- or 12-fold) [86,87]. In both systems, the mismatch has been implicated in relative rotational movement [88,89] and such rotation has been elegantly demonstrated in the F1F0 system [90,91]. Returning to energy-dependent proteases, it is appealing to equate the symmetry mismatch with the relative rotation of the ATPase and the protease during processive
Figure 2 Axial view of the ClpAP complex at 29 Å resolution [71··]. ClpP (yellow) has sevenfold symmetry and ClpA (blue) has sixfold symmetry, so that the interactions between pairs of subunits in the two rings are nonequivalent. Their binding is inferred to be dependent on a key interaction (white asterisk) between one specific subunit in ClpA (red dot) and one ClpP subunit (green dot). Relative rotation by only 8.6° (equivalent to a shift of 4.5 Å at the point of contact) transfers the key relationship to neighboring subunits. Thus, the symmetry mismatch is conducive to relative rotation without disengagement of the two subcomplexes. Such rotation might occur during the processive translocation of substrates into ClpP [71··]. A similar symmetry mismatch occurs in the 26S proteasome and some other energy-dependent proteases (see Table 1).

Conclusions
Common to all known energy-dependent proteases is a linear arrangement of the proteolytic modules and the regulatory modules, which prepare substrates for degradation. These tasks include substrate recognition, unfolding and translocation. Although the exact role of ATP hydrolysis remains to be established, it is likely that the energy-dependent steps are unfolding and translocation. Although not universal, a recurring feature is a symmetry mismatch between the ATPase module and the proteolytic module. This property, which occurs in the proteasome, as well as in the ClpAP and ClpXP proteases, has led to the hypothesis that the symmetry mismatch may facilitate relative rotation of the respective modules in the processive degradation of substrates. However, there is no such mismatch in Lon nor, putatively, in ClpYQ (HslUV) [94··]. This may indicate that processivity in the latter complexes is effected by movements involving axial translations, rather than relative motions between the respective modules.
