Crystallization of Phycoerythrocyanin from the Cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus and Preliminary Characterization of Two Crystal Forms
The light-harvesting protein phycoerythrocyanin from the cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus Cohn has been crystallized in two different crystal forms by vapour diffusion. In 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol at pH 8.5, hexagonal crystals of space group Pci, wit'h cell constants a = b = 158 A, c = 40.6 A were obtained, which turned out to be almost isomorphous with the hexagonal crystals of C-phycocyanin from the same organism. Consequently, the conformation of both phycobiliproteins must be very similar. From 1.5 M-ammonium sulfate (pH !3*5), orthorhombic crystals of space group P222, with cell constants a = 60.5 A, b = 105 A, c = 188 A could be grown. Density measurement's of these crystals indicate that the unit cell contains 18 (@)-units. A detailed packing scheme is proposed that is consistent with the observed pseudo-hexagonal X-ray intensity pattern and with the known size and shape of (a/3),-trimers of C-phycocyanin. Accordingly, disc-like (c$),-trimers are associated face-to-face and stacked one upon another in rods with a period of 60.5 A, corresponding to the cell dimension a.

In cyanobacteria and red algae, phycobiliproteins form high molecular weight complexes called phycobilisomes (for a review, see Glazer, 1984). They are attached to the stromal surface of the thylakoid membrane. The phycobiliproteins absorb light and funnel its energy to the photosynthetic reaction centres. Electron microscopic studies of phycobilisomes from Mastigocladus laminosus (Nies & Wehrmeyer, 1980) show a core of allophycocyanin discs from which stacks of C-phycocyanin and phycoerythrocyanin protrude in a hemidiscoidal arrangement. PECt is in the outermost position. Three (@I)-phycobiliprotein subunits form disc-shaped trimers, which build up the stacks of the phycobilisome. The energy flow is directed from PEC PL,,, 575 nm) to CPC (A,,, 620 to 637 nm) to APC (A max 650 nm) to allophycocyanin B (APC B, A max 675 nm) and then to chlorophyll a. consists of two subunits: an PEC of M. laminosus a-chain of 162 amino acid residues with a covalently linked red, unknown chromophore and a b-chain of 171 residues with two phycocyanobilin chromophores (Fiiglistaller et al., 1983; Frank et al., 1978). Comparing the seyuences of PEC and CPC, there are homologies of 63% for the a and 67% for the /I-subunits (Fiiglistaller et al., 1983). From the relatively high sequence homologies between PEC and CPC, a quite similar three-dimensional arrangement of the polypeptide chains was expected. Crystals of biliproteins have been known for a long time (Molisch, 1894). PEC was first crystallized by Bryant et al. (1976). Several att#empts have been 7 Abbreviations used: PEC, phycoerythrocyanin: C-phycocyanin; APC, allophycocyanin.

undertaken to obtain the structure of phycobiliproteins (Dobler et al., 1972; Fisher et aE., 1980; Hackert et al., 1977; Abad-Zapatero et al., 1977). Only very recently, the structure of an hexagonal crystal form of CPC from M. laminosus was solved at high resolution (Schirmer et aZ., 1985a,b). The PEC used for crystallization was isolated from whole phycobilisomes of M. laminosus Cohn (genus Fischerella, PCC 7603) grown in white light at 58°C in 10 1 Castenholz medium D (Castenholz, 1970). The flow-rate of fresh air containing 1% CO, was 1 l/min. The phycobilisomes were obtained according to the method of Fiiglistaller et al. (1984) and dissociated into smaller complexes by dialysis 5 ma-potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The against phycobiliprotein solution was fractionated on a, Cellex-D column with a linear gradient from 5 mM to 200 mM-potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The PEC I fraction eluted with the void volume, whereas all other biliproteins eluted at higher concentrations of phosphate (Fiiglistaller et al., 1981). Sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gels of the PEC I fraction showed that the eluted complex contained uncoloured linker polypeptides of 8900 M, and 34,500 M, as well as the a and B-subunits of PEC. Crystallization of the intact PEC linker complex could not be achieved. It seems that the uncoloured proteins disturb the crystal formation under the conditions used. To get rid of the uncoloured polypeptides, the PEC I fraction was stored for three weeks at 4°C. During this time, the 8900 M, and the 34,500 M, proteins were completely degraded by an unknown co-isolated protease, whereas the a and P-PEC subunits remained intact. PEC was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour 0

diffusion technique at room temperature. Hexagonal, prismatic crystals of dimensions 0.3 mm x 0.3 mm x 0.6 mm were grown at a protein concentration of 64 mg/ml in the presence of 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 4000 or 2000, 5 mMpotassium phosphate, 1 mM-sodium azide, at pH 85. After four weeks the crystals were transferred to 15% polyethylene glycol, 5 mw-potassium phosphate (pH 8.5). According to precession photographs, these hexagonal crystals are of space group unit cell constants a = b = 158 A, P63 with c = 40.6 A, c( = fl = 90", y = 120". The crystals are suitable for structure analysis to a resolution of at least 2.5 A. The cell constants are very similar to those of CPC crystals (P6,; a = b = 154.6 A, c = 40.5 A) from the same organism (Dobler et al., 1972, Schirmer et al., 1985a,b). Even more, a comparison of the corresponding intensity patterns of the hk0 and h0Z planes reveals that both crystals are highly isomorphous. Therefore, as in the CPC crystals, the unit cell must contain two (c&s-trimers, which are arranged around the two equivalent 3-fold rotation axes. Furthermore, the resemblance of the intensity patterns of CPC and PEC reflects a very similar conformation of the two biliproteins. At 1.5 M-ammonium sulphate, 5 mM-potassium phosphate (pH 85), 1 mM-sodium azide and a, protein concentration of 3.6 mg/ml, thin plate-like

crystals of maximal dimension 0.6 mm could be one month. Precession photographs grown within exhibit the orthorhombic space group P222, and cell dimensions a = 60.5 A, b = 105 A, unit c = 188 A. a = /? = y = 90". Rotation photographs show reflections beyond 3.5 A resolution. The crystal density of this crystal form is 1.166 (+0*013) g/cm3 as determined by a modified Ficoll density-gradient method (Bode & Schirmer, 1985). This corresponds to a protein cont'ent, of three (@)-monomers per asymmetric unit and a packing density of V, = 2.6 A3/dalton. The screened precession photograph of the Ok1 plane displays a star-like pseudo-hexagonal intensity pat,tern (Fig. 1). Apart from this striking non-crystallographic symmetry, several lines of evidence suggest, the pseudo-hexagonal crystal packing shown in Figure 2. The dimension of the a-axis (60.5 A) is just twice the height, of the CPC (aa),-trimer from M. Zaminosua (Schirmer et al., 1985,) and virtually identical with the height of the CPC hexamers from Agmenellum quadruplicatum as observed in trigonal cryst,als of space group P321 and cell constant,s a = b = 184.5 A, c = 60.5 A (Hacker+ et al., 1977: Huber et al., unpublished result's). This suggests that also in the orthorhombic PEC crystals disc-like trimers of approximate dimensions 110 A x 30 .h are the fundamental building blocks and that' these trimers are stacked one upon another face-to-face in

The 2 hexamers (1,2) of the unit cell are centred at (0. -l/4. l/4) and (0, l/4, 3/4), respectively, i.e. the hexamer centres are placed on the crystallographic dyads that are running in the b direction. The displacement from the c-axis was chosen to be l/4 to obtain the closepacked pseudo-hexagonal arrangement.

run through the hexamers and, therefore, the hexamers must be placed between them. Due to the relatively dense packing, one of the local 2-fold axes of the hexamers must coincide with the crystallographic dyads in the b direction. The position of the hexamer centre along b is, in principle, not restricted. For an optimal packing of cylinder-like objects of approximate dimensions (Fig. 2(b)), however, they should be displaced about l/4 apart from the S-fold screw axis c. In such a model, the distances between the centres of the hexamers are l-l' = b = 108 .&, l-2 = l'-2 = 105 A. i.e. they are close to the approximate diameter of the CPC hexamers (110 8). Because the lateral contacts between the hexamers are not isologous, the three distances may differ slightly. The packing scheme represents a close-packed pseudo-hexagonal arrangement of cylinders. Local 2-fold rotation axes are running parallel to the diagonals of the bc rectangle and form angles of SO"& 1" with respect to b. The intensity spikes of the OkZ zone (Fig. 1) are parallel to bhe local 2-fold symmetry axes (one of which coincides with the crystallographic S-fold parallel bo b). The calculation of a projection of the native Patterson map on confirmed this the bc plane (not shown) further packing model. Along lines perpendicular to the local 2-fold symmetry axes, this projection exhibits enhanced density comparable to that -of the crystallographic Harker plane projec+ons. The continuous stacks of hexamers that constitute the orthorhombic PEC cryst)als closely resemble the peripheral rods of native phycobilisomes as seen on electron micrographs (e.g. Bryant et al., 1979). Although the structures of PEC and CPC seem to be quite similar. t'here must be some very important differences that determine, for example, the out,ermost position of PEC in the phycobilisome stack, the location of CPC between the APC core and PEC. and specific binding sites for the appropriate linker polypeptides within the phycobiliprotein X-ray complexes. structure analyses of these PEC crystals would show the molecular interactions between trimers within a given hexamer as well as bet'ween adjacent hexamers. Furthermore, an analysis of bot,h crystal forms should reveal the nature of the unknown chromophore and its specific arrangement within the a-subunit and thus explain the characteristic spectroscopic properties.
