Abstract IsCT-P (ILKKIWKPIKKLF-NH2) is a novel a-helical antimicrobial peptide with bacterial cell selectivity designed from a scorpion-derived peptide IsCT. To investigate the role of L- or D-Pro kink on the structure and the mode of action of a short a-helical antimicrobial peptide with bacterial cell selectivity, we synthesized IsCT-p, in which D-Pro is substituted for L-Pro8 of IsCT-P. CD spectra revealed that IsCT-P adopted a typical a-helical structure in various membrane-mimicking conditions, whereas IsCT-p showed a random structure. This result indicated that D-Pro in the central position of a short a-helical peptide provides more remarkable structural flexibility than L-Pro. Despite its higher antibacterial activity, IsCT-p was much less effective at inducing dye leakage in the negatively charged liposome mimicking bacterial membrane and induced no or little membrane potential depolarization of Staphylococcus aureus. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that IsCT-p penetrated the bacterial cell membrane and accumulated in the cytoplasm, whereas IsCT-P remained outside or on the cell membrane. These results suggested that the major target of IsCT-P and IsCT-p is the bacterial membranes and intracellular components, respectively. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the central D-Pro kink in a-helical antimicrobial peptides plays an important role in penetrating bacterial membrane as well as bacterial cell selectivity.

Antimicrobial peptides play an important role in the host defense systems of all living organisms against invading pathogens [1­3]. They display a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and enveloped viruses [1­3]. Their principal mode of antimicrobial action appears to involve depolarization or permeabilization of the bacterial cell membrane, although the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. In most cases, these peptides

adopt amphipathic secondary structures, including a-helix, b-sheet or b-turn in membrane-mimicking environments [4]. The most abundant structural type in naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides is an amphipathic a-helix [5]. There are two classes in naturally occurring a-helical antimicrobial peptides: cell-selective peptides (e.g., cecropins and magainins), which have strong activity against only bacterial cells; and noncell-selective peptides (e.g., melittin and pardaxin), which have lytic activity against both mammalian and bacterial cells. Many studies have been focused on designing cellselective peptides with strong antibacterial activity but

no hemolytic activity (used as a measurement of cytotoxicity in mammalian cells) for use as antibiotic drugs. Proline has been recognized as a potent a-helix breaking amino acid because of its instability to form backbone hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, proline residues have been found in numerous transmembrane helices of membrane proteins. Furthermore, proline residues is found in a number of membrane-active a-helical antimicrobial peptides that promote transmembrane channel/pore formation, such as cecropin A, pardaxin-1, melittin, alamethicin, and PMAP-23 [4,5]. These peptides contain one or two prolines residues near the middle of their sequences as a kink motif. The proline kink is known to serve as a hinge region to facilitate the ion channel activation and thus enhance antimicrobial activity. The incorporation of Pro into the central position of linear a-helical antimicrobial peptides lacking proline has been reported as a useful method for designing cell-selective antimicrobial peptides [6­13]. The 13-amino-acid-residue IsCT (ILGKIWE GIKSLF-NH2) isolated from the scorpion Opisthacanthus madagascariensis is one of the shortest of naturally occurring a-helical antimicrobial peptides [14]. IsCT may be a candidate for drug development by virtue of the fact that it displays potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Its therapeutic potential, however, is limited by its relatively strong hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes [14]. In the present study, we designed a short a-helical cell-selective antimicrobial peptide, IsCT-P (ILKKIWKPIKKLF-NH2) by Lys-substitution of Gly3, Glu7 and Ser11 and L-Pro-substitution of Gly8 in IsCT. As shown in their a-helical wheel diagram (Fig. 1), IsCT-P was designed to increase the cationicity without change in amphipathicity and to provide the structural flexibility in the near central position of the peptide. To investigate the effect of L- or D-Pro kink on the structure and mode of action of a-helical antimicrobial peptides, we synthesized a D-Pro-containing IsCT-p, in which D-Pro is substituted for L-Pro8 of IsCT-P. We characterized the biological activity of these peptides towards several microorganisms containing antibioticresistant bacterial strains and human erythrocytes, and

we examined their interaction with model phospholipid membranes by tryptophan fluorescence. Furthermore, we examined the secondary structures of the peptides in membrane-mimicking environments by CD spectroscopy, and we assessed their ability to cause the permeabilization or depolarization of bacterial cell membrane. Finally, to examine the target sites of IsCT-P and IsCT-p in Escherichia coli, FITC-labeled peptides were visualized under confocal laser scanning microscopy.

Materials and methods
Materials. Rink amide 4-methyl benzhydrylamine resin, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) amino acids and other reagents for peptide synthesis were purchased from Calibiochem­Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). Egg yolk L-a-phosphatidylcholine (EYPC), egg yolk L-a-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol (EYPG), egg yolk L-a-phosphatidylethanolamine (EYPE), acrylamide, trifluoroethanol (TFE), Tris [tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane], sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), calcein, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and gramicidin D (GD) were supplied from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). 3,3 0 -Dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide [DiSC3(5)] was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents were of analytical grade. The buffers were prepared in double glass-distilled water. Peptide synthesis. The peptides used in this study were prepared by the standard Fmoc-based solid-phase method on rink amide 4-methyl benzhydrylamine resin (0.54 mmol/g). The crude peptide was purified by preparative RPLC on a 15 lm C18 reverse phase Shim-pack column (Shimadzu, Japan; 20 · 250 mm). The purified peptides were shown to be homogeneous (98%<) by analytical RP-HPLC on a 5 lm C18 reverse phase Shim-pack column (Shimadzu, Japan; 4.6 · 250 mm). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Shimadzu, Japan) was used to confirm their molecular weights (Table 1). Bacterial strains. Escherichia coli (KCTC 1682), Salmonella typhimurium (KCTC 1926), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (KCTC 1637), Staphylococcus epidermidis (KCTC 1917), and Staphylococcus aureus (KCTC 1621) were purchased from the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) at Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) in Korea. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (CCARM 3001 and CCARM 3543) and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA) (CCARM 2095) were obtained from the Culture Collection of Antibiotic-Resistant Microbes (CCARM) at Seoul WomenÕs University in Korea. Antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activities of the peptides were examined in sterile 96-well plates (Nunc F96 microtiter plates) in a final volume of 100 lL as fellows.

suspension at 2 · 106 colony forming units (CFU)/mL in culture medium (1% peptone) were added to 50 lL of aqueous peptide solution (serial 2-fold dilutions in 1% peptone). After incubation of 18­ 20 h at 37 °C, the inhibition of bacterial growth was determined by measuring the absorbance at 620 nm with a Microplate autoreader EL 800 (Bio-tek Instruments). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of peptide that inhibited growth. Hemolytic activity. Fresh human red blood cells (h-RBCs) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline PBS (PBS; 35 mM phosphate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) by centrifugation 10 min at 1000g and resuspended in PBS. The peptide solutions were then added to 50 lL of h-RBC in PBS to give a final volume of 100 lL and a final erythrocyte concentration of 4% v/v. The resulting suspension was incubated under agitation for 60 min at 37 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min. The release of hemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 405 nm. Controls for no hemolysis (blank) and 100% hemolysis consisted of human red blood cells suspended in PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of IsCT-P and IsCT-p were recorded at 25 °C using a Jasco J-715 CD spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). The spectra were recorded in a 1 mm path length cell at a peptide concentration of 100 lg/mL in various membrane-mimicking solvents: (a) 50% (v/v) TFE, (b) 30 mM SDS micelles, (c) 30 mM DPC micelles, and (d) 0.1% LPS. In each case, the CD spectrum of the solvent was subtracted from the spectrum of the peptide. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching. Excitation of Trp was performed at 295 nm instead of 280 nm to reduce absorbance by acrylamide [15,16]. Trp fluorescence was quenched by the titration of acrylamide from a 4 M stock solution to a final concentration of 0.4 M in the presence of liposomes at a peptide/lipid molar ratio of 1:200. The quenching data were analyzed by the Stern­Volmer plot using the following equation: F0/F = 1 + Ksv [Q], where F0 is the fluorescence of the peptide in the absence of acrylamide, F is the fluorescence of the peptide in the presence of acrylamide, Ksv is the Stern­Volmer quenching constant, and [Q] is the concentration of acrylamide. Dye leakage from lipid vesicles. Calcein-entrapped large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of EYPE/EYPG (7:3, w/w) were prepared by vortexing the dried lipid in dye buffer solution (70 mM calcein, 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). Untrapped calcein was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 column. The leakage of calcein from the LUVs was monitored by measuring fluorescence intensity at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm on a model RF-5301PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto Japan). The measurements were performed at 25 °C. For determination of 100% dye-release, 10% Triton X-100 (20 lL) was added to dissolve the vesicles. Membrane potential depolarization. Membrane depolarization activity of the peptides was determined using intact Staphylococcus aureus cells and the membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent dye, DiSC3(5) as described by Friedrich et al. [17]. S. aureus cells were collected in mid-logarithmic phase and resuspended in buffer (100 mM NaCl, 25 mM potassium phosphate, and 0.2% glucose, pH 7.4) at 4 °C and immediately placed on ice for fluorescence measurements. There-

fore, cells at an optical density at 600 nm of 0.05 were mixed with 20 nM DiSC3(5) in a fluorescence cuvette. The fluorescence emission was monitored at 20 °C by using a model RF-5301PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 650 nm and emission wavelength of 670 nm. Full dissipation of the membrane potential was obtained by adding GD (gramicidin D) (final concentration 0.2 nM). Confocal laser scanning microscopy. Escherichia coli cells in midlogarithmic phase were prepared as described in the antimicrobial activity section of Materials and methods. E. coli cells (107 CFU/mL) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (NAPB), pH 7.4 were incubated with FITC-labeled peptides at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, cells were washed with 10 mM NAPB and immobilized on a poly-L-lysinecoated glass slide. Visualization and localization of the FITC-labeled peptides was performed by using an Olympus IX 70 confocal laser scanning microscope (Japan). Fluorescent images were obtained with a 488-nm bandpass filter for excitation of FITC.

Results Antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the peptides The antimicrobial activities of the peptides against three Gram-negative, three Gram-positive, and three antibiotic-resistant species of bacteria were determined by broth microdilution method. The MIC values of the peptides are summarized in Table 2. IsCT-P and IsCT-p showed almost similar antimicrobial activity (MIC: 1­2 lM) against all the bacterial strains tested. As a measure of cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, we examined the hemolytic activity of the peptides against human erythrocytes. We found that IsCT-P and IsCT-p did not cause any hemolysis at peptide concentrations as high as 200 lM (Table 2). Conformation of the peptides In buffer containing 50% (v/v) TFE, 30 mM SDS, 30 mM DPC or 0.1% LPS, IsCT-P adopted a predominant a-helical structure, whereas IsCT-p exhibited a

mostly unordered structure (Fig. 2). This result indicated that D-Pro in the central position of a short a-helical peptide provides more remarkable structural flexibility than L-Pro. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching Tryptophan fluorescence quenching was performed with water-soluble fluorescence quencher, acrylamide. Stern­Volmer plots for the quenching of tryptophan were recorded by acrylamide in the presence of negatively charged EYPE/EYPG (7:3, w/w) vesicles mimicking bacterial membrane or zwitterionic EYPC/cholesterol (10:1, w/w) vesicles resembling mammalian membrane (Fig. 3). In EYPE/EYPG (7:3, w/w) vesicles, IsCT-P and IsCT-p showed almost similar much lower slope, suggesting the Trp residue of these peptides effectively embedded within the hydrophobic environment of EYPE/EYPG (7:3, w/w) vesicles. In EYPC/cholesterol (10:1, w/w) vesicles, IsCT-P exhibited much higher slope than that of IsCT-p. This result suggests that the Trp residue of IsCT-p is less anchored within hydrophobic core of zwitterionic phospholipid vesicles compared to IsCT-P.

Peptide-induced dye-leakage from calcein-loaded vesicles To determine whether the bacterial membrane is the target of the peptides, we tested the ability of the peptides to cause membrane leakage by testing their ability to evoke calcein release from negatively charged EYPE/ EYPG (7:3, w/w) vesicles mimicking bacterial membrane (Fig. 4). IsCT-p induced less calcein leakage from EYPE/EYPG (7:3, w/w) vesicles compared to IsCT-P. Interestingly, despite its potent antimicrobial activity, IsCT-p induced very little calcein release from negatively charged vesicles, even at a concentration as high as 1.5 lM. These results suggested that the antimicrobial action of IsCT-p is not due to the permeabilization of the cell membrane. Membrane depolarization of intact bacterial cells The ability of the peptides to depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane of the Gram-positive bacterium, S. aureus was examined using the membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent dye DiSC3(5). This dye concentrates in the cytoplasmic membrane under the influence of the membrane potential, resulting in a

self-quenching of fluorescence. Upon disruption of the membrane potential, the dye dissociates into the buffer, leading to an increase in fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 5, the fluorescence intensity of DiSC3(5) was strongly quenched when this dye accumulates in the membrane interior of energized cells (first arrow). After a stable signal was observed, the peptides were added (second arrow). The membrane potential-dissipating activities of the peptides can be determined in relation to the effect of gramicidin D (GD) (third arrow), which fully collapses the membrane potential. IsCT-P caused a rapid increase in fluorescence due to a collapse of the ion gradients that generate the membrane potential, as observed magainin II known as a membrane-permeabilizing peptide. Interestingly, like buforin II and PR-39, which are known as cell-penetrating antimicrobial peptides, IsCT-p induced no or little membrane potentialdissipating activity. These results suggested that the antimicrobial action of IsCT-p is not due to the depolarization of bacterial cell membrane. Confocal laser scanning microscopy To determine the target site of action of the peptides, FITC-labeled peptides were incubated with E. coli, and their localization was visualized by confocal laser scan-

channel or otherwise disrupts the membrane, the membrane potential will be dissipated and the dye will be released into the medium, causing the fluorescence to increase. Like buforin II and PR-39, IsCT-p induced no or little dissipation of the membrane potential. In contrast, as observed for magainin II, IsCT-P caused a significant membrane depolarization. Furthermore, to determine whether IsCT-P and IsCT-p penetrates bacterial cell membranes, we carried out confocal laser scanning microscopy using FITC-labeled peptides. FITC-labeled IsCT-p penetrated the cell membrane and accumulated in the cytoplasm, whereas FITC-labeled IsCT-P did not penetrate but remained on bacterial cell membrane. These results suggested that the major working place of action of IsCT-P and IsCT-p is the membrane and the cytoplasm of bacterial cell, respectively. IsCT-p probably exerts its antibacterial action via the inhibition of the intracellular functions after penetrating the bacterial cell membrane.

Discussion Acknowledgments Two general mechanisms were proposed to describe the process of phospholipid membrane permeation by a-helical antimicrobial peptides [18]. In the first, the barrel-stave model, amphipathic a-helices insert into the hydrophobic core of the membrane and form transmembrane channels/pores. In the second, the carpet-like model, peptides that do not need necessarily to adopt an amphipathic a-helical structure, are in contact with the lipid head group during the whole process of membrane permeation and do not insert into the hydrophobic core of the membrane. In contrast to these membrane-interacting peptides, other classes of antimicrobial peptides have been suggested to target other bacterial components than membranes. Buforin II, discovered in the stomach tissue of the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans, is one example. Buforin II was known to inhibit the intramolecular synthesis by penetration into the bacterial membrane without severe membrane permeabilization [19­21]. To determine whether the bacterial membrane is the target of IsCT-P and IsCT-p, we tested the ability of the peptides to cause leakage of a fluorescent dye entrapped within LUVs composed of negatively charged phospholipids. In contrast to IsCT-P, despite effective binding and insertion into negatively charged phospholipids as demonstrated by tryptophan fluorescence quenching, IsCT-p induced little dye leakage from negatively charged phospholipids vesicles. The ability of the peptides to depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane of S. aureus was examined using the membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent dye DiSC3(5). This dye inserts into the cytoplasmic membrane under the influence of the membrane potential gradient and quenches its own fluorescence.
