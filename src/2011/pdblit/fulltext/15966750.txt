ABSTRACT: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are members of the neuropeptide Y family of hormones. They bind to the Y receptors with very different affinities: Whereas PP is highly selective for the Y4 receptor, NPY displays highest affinites for Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptor subtypes. Introducing the NPY segment 19-23 into PP leads to an increase in affinity at the Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes whereas the exchange of this segment from PP into NPY leads to a large decrease in affinity at all receptor subtypes. PP displays a very stable structure in solution, with the N terminus being backfolded onto the C-terminal R-helix (the so-called PP-fold). The helix of NPY is less stable and the N terminus is freely diffusing in solution. The exchange of this segment, however, does not alter the PPfold propensities of the chimeric peptides in solution. The structures of the phospholipid micelle-bound peptides serving to mimic the membrane-bound species display segregation into a more flexible N-terminal region and a well-defined R-helical region. The introduction of the [19-23]-pNPY segment into hPP leads to an N-terminal extension of the R-helix, now starting at Pro14 instead of Met17. In contrast, a truncated helix is observed in [19-23hPP]-pNPY, starting at Leu17 instead of Ala14. All peptides display moderate binding affinities to neutral membranes (Kassoc in the range of 1.7 to 6.8 × 104 mol-1 as determined by surface plasmon resonance) with the differences in binding being most probably related to the exchange of Arg-19 (pNPY) by Glu-23 (hPP). Differences in receptor binding properties between the chimeras and their parental peptides are therefore most likely due to changes in the conformation of the micelle-bound peptides.

Neurohormones play an important role in the regulation of numerous biological processes. The neuropeptide Y (NPY1) family of neuroendocrinic peptides includes the neurotransmitter NPY and the two gut hormones peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). These peptides contain 36 residues and are C-terminally amidated. The sequences of the peptides discussed in this study are listed in Table 1. They activate the so-called Y receptors, six subtypes of which have been characterized so far and are called Y1-y6 receptors (1). They are Gi-protein coupled

receptors, and upon activation they inhibit adenylate cyclase and lead to increased levels of intracellular calcium. PP is mainly expressed in the endocrinic pancreas and is released as a response to food intake (2). It acts as a regulator of feeding behavior (3). PP binds with picomolar affinity to the Y4 receptor and with nanomolar affinity to the Y5 receptor. The binding affinities are given in Table 2. NPY is localized in neurons of various regions of the brain as well as in peripheral neurons. NPY is also important for the regulation of food intake and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes. It exhibits subnanomolar affinities to the Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors and low nanomolar affinities to the Y4 receptor (see Table 2). For a recent review on the NPY family see Morl et al. (4). ¨

It was soon hypothesised that the very different receptor subtype binding affinities may be encoded in certain parts of the amino acid sequence of the peptides. Therefore different PP/NPY chimeras were synthesized in order to combine biological features of both into a single peptide and their binding properties were characterized (5). Various single or multiple mutations were examined. Interestingly, swapping residues 19-23, part of the C-terminal R-helix, between NPY and PP led to interesting changes in binding affinities, whereby introducing the NPY segment into PP caused remarkably higher affinities at the Y1 and Y2 subtypes and to about 1020-fold higher affinity at the Y5 receptor without concomitant loss of binding affinity at the Y4 receptor (Table 2). In addition, exchanges that caused an interesting modification in the binding properties were combined leading to the development of agonists with picomolar affinities at the Y5 receptor. For an overview of these experiments see Cabrele et al. (6). PP and NPY display characteristically different structures in solution. The first structure for a member of this family was the crystal structure of avian pancreatic polypeptide (aPP) (7). Therein, aPP displays an elongated shape and contains two regions of secondary structure. Residues 1-8 form an extended polyproline helix which is connected by a -turn to a C-terminal R-helix comprising residues 14-31. This structural motif later became known as the PP-fold and was confirmed to also exist in solution by the NMR structure of bPP (8). PP and NPY share a sequence homology of about 50%, and the C-terminal half is characterized by an amphiphilic helix and therefore such a PP-fold was also postulated for NPY (9). Later structures however established that NPY forms dimers in solution in which the N termini remain flexible (10-12). Representative structures of the NMR ensembles of hNPY and bPP demonstrating the difference in back-folding are depicted in Figure 1. In 1984 Kaiser and Kezdy recognized that only a few key residues of peptide hormones are involved in forming contacts to their receptors and proposed that composition and amphiphilicity of an R-helix might be important for

biological activity such that the helix promotes interactions with biological membranes (13). These ideas were later refined by Schwyzer et al. in his membrane compartment theory (14-16). The theory proposes that the membrane induces a conformation that is partially preformed for receptor binding and that it is the conformation of the membrane-bound species that is recognized by the receptor. Accordingly, we determined the structures of pNPY (12), [Ala31,Pro32]-pNPY (17), bPP (18), and pPYY (19) when bound to phospholipid micelles and discovered significant differences from the solution structures. Because the exchange of the helical segment 19-23 leads to dramatically altered receptor binding properties (Table 2), we decided to characterize the two chimeras [hPP19-23]pNPY and [pNPY19-23]-hPP in solution and when bound to DPC micelles, as receptor binding data were available for these two peptides. Comparison of the structural data to those from the parental peptides should reveal whether structural changes occur that might explain the differences in receptor binding affinities. Of particular interest to us was whether these structural differences were larger in the presence or the absence of the phospholipid micelles. Special attention was given to potentially different back-folding propensities of the peptides in solution. Using surface plasmon resonance we have additionally determined whether the chimeric peptides display largely altered membrane association af-

In particular we were interested to see whether and how these membrane-binding data are related to the trends observed for receptor binding affinities. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning, Expression and Purification of Peptides. Following the strategy described by Kohno et al. (20) we expressed the peptides as N-terminally decahistidine-tagged yeast ubiquitin fusion-protein. The uniformly 15N labeled peptides were grown on minimal media containing 15N-NH4Cl as sole nitrogen source. After enzymatic cleavage with the ubiquitin hydrolase (YUH), C-terminal amidation was performed by enzymatic conversion of an extra Gly residue into an amide function using the R-amidating peptidyl glycine amidase (PAM). We started with a plasmid containing the DNA coding for the parental peptides (12, 18) and designed primers coding for the exchanged segments 19-23. In the case of [pNPY19-23]-hPP the additional point mutation Glu6Val had to be introduced by site directed mutagenesis. The sequences were confirmed using dideoxy sequencing. Expression, isolation and purification were performed following the method of Kohno (20) as previously described (18). Purity was checked by HPLC on a RP18 column, and completeness of the amidation reaction was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (15N-[hPP19-23]-pNPY theoretical mass 4214.5 amu, experimental mass 4214.4 amu; 15N[pNPY19-23]-hPP theoretical mass 4329.8 amu, experimental mass 4330.0 amu; SSQ710, Finnigan, San Jose, CA). NMR Spectroscopy. The peptide concentration for structure elucidation was approximately 2.0 mM, 1.0 mM for the measurements of the 15N{1H}-NOE and 0.4 mM for the spinlabel experiments. For spin-label experiments and relaxation data uniformly 15N labeled peptides were used. The peptides were dissolved in a solution containing 300 mM DPC micelles in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O at pH 6.0 (uncorrected meter reading). For examination of the aliphatic region the samples were lyophilized and redissolved in 99.9% 2H2O. For the 15 N{1H}-NOE of unligated peptides, samples of uniformly 15 N labeled peptides were used at concentrations of approximately 1.0 mM, pH 3.1 or pH 4.6 for [hPP19-23]-pNPY and [pNPY19-23]-hPP, respectively. The temperature was set to 305 K for [hPP19-23]-pNPY and 301 K for [pNPY19-23]-hPP. Spectra for assignment and structure determination of the micelle-bound peptides were recorded at 310 K on a Bruker AVANCE 700 MHz spectrometer or a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer, 1H-NOE relayed [15N,1H]-HSQC and the 15N{1H}-NOE spectra were measured on a DRX-500 spectrometer. [1H,1H]-clean TOCSY and zero-quantum suppressed NOESY experiments were performed as described previously (12). For further details of spectroscopy and data evaluation see Bader et al. (12). The micelle integrating spin-label 5-doxyl-stearic acid was used to determine the orientation of the peptides with respect to the membrane surface. The methodology was described in detail for pNPY (12). Structure Calculation. Sequential resonance assignment was performed largely following the procedures developed by Wuthrich and described in more detail in Bader et al. ¨ (12). Differences in chemical shifts with respect to those of the parental peptides were small for parts of the molecules not containing mutations. The complete list of assignments of 1H and 15N chemical shifts of the two chimeras bound to

The structure calculations were done by restrained molecular dynamics in dihedral angle space using the standard simulated annealing protocol as implemented in the program DYANA (21). The distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra recorded with a mixing time of 75 ms measured either in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O or in 99.9% 2H2O. 3 JHNR coupling constants <6.0 Hz indicate the presence of an R-helix and were included in the structure calculations. Such reduced scalar couplings were observed for residues Ala12, Ala14, Leu17-Leu30, Arg33, and Gln34 in [hPP19-23]pNPY and for residues Thr13, Met17-Asn29, Leu31, and Arg33 in [pNPY19-23]-hPP. The Supporting Information includes a graphical overview of the applied restraints and a table containing the 3JHNR coupling constants. The 20 refined structures with lowest energy contributions from intramolecular interactions were chosen to represent the NMR ensemble. The quality of the final structures was assessed using the program PROCHECK-NMR (22). Further analysis of the conformers including calculation of root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) was performed in the molecular graphics program MOLMOL (23), which was also used to prepare all figures. The determined structures have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics protein database under accession codes 1TZ4 ([hPP19-23]pNPY) and 1TZ5 ([pNPY19-23]-hPP). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Experiments. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) (50 nM) were prepared in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 150 mM sodium chloride using procedures described by us in detail previously (24). The pH for the SPR measurements was chosen to best mimic biological conditions while still providing sufficient solubility of the peptides. Unfortunately, rapid hydrogen exchange hampers NMR spectroscopy and hence a slightly more acidic pH was required for these experiments. The L1 sensor chip was installed in a BIACORE 3000 analytical system (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden), and the surface was washed by injecting 5 µL of 20 mM CHAPS at a flow rate of 5 µL/min. SUVs (80 µL) were immediately applied to the sensor chip surface at a flow rate of 2 µL/min. Multilamellar structures were removed from the lipid surface by injecting 30 µL of 10 mM sodium hydroxide at a flow rate of 50 µL/min, resulting in a stable baseline. Peptide solutions (50 µL) in the concentration range between 2.5 and 25 µM (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) were injected during 200 s at a flow rate of 15 µL/min at 25 °C. Upon completion of injection, buffer flow was continued for 600 s to allow for complete dissociation. The affinity of each peptide for the lipid surface was determined from analysis of a series of response curves collected at seven different peptide concentrations. The sensorgrams for each peptide-lipid interaction were analyzed by curve fitting using numerical integration analysis. Kinetic data were extracted by simultaneously fitting the peptide sensorgrams obtained at seven different concentrations using BIA evaluation software (version 4.1). A twostate model, describing association followed by a conformational or orientational changesin our case triggered by membrane insertionswas applied to the resultant peptide binding curves to estimate the association and dissociation

in which ka1 or ka2 and kd1 or kd2 are the separate association and dissociation constants of the two processes occurring during binding and R1 and R2 the corresponding rate constants (25). RESULTS The Fold of the Peptides in Solution. A prominent feature of the solution structure of bovine PP is the occurrence of the so-called PP-fold, in which the otherwise largely unstructured N-terminal half of the molecule is back-folded onto the C-terminal R-helix. We showed recently by a careful comparison of structural data of a number of peptides from the NPY family with the corresponding 15N{1H}-NOE data that the latter is an ideal parameter to quantify the extent of back-folding (18, 19). We would like to emphasize here that the 15N{1H}-NOE does not provide sufficient information to create secondary structure in general, but in our specific case, where the type of secondary structure to be expected is clear (and supported by a larger number of structures we determined the usual way), it is a reliable and fast method

to define the length of the C-terminal helix and the extent of back-folding. In a rigid part of the molecule the 15N{1H}NOE will be close to 0.8 and exhibit smaller or even negative values for more flexible regions such as amide moieties of a freely diffusing N-terminal segment. The values for the 15N{1H}-NOE in aqueous solution are depicted in Figure 2. The differences between [hPP19-23]pNPY or pNPY (left) and [pNPY19-23]-hPP or bPP (right) are much more pronounced than the differences between the chimeric and their parental peptides. The data for [hPP19-23]pNPY and pNPY display only few positive values with those from [hPP19-23]-pNPY being lower than those of pNPY in the helical segment. Moreover, the NOE data indicate that the extent to which [hPP19-23]-pNPY is folded is so low that it is very unlikely that the structure could be determined properly, provided that the peptide is structured at all. In the case of pNPY both the NMR structure and the 15N{1H}NOE data are incompatible with back-folding of the N terminus and, as [hPP19-23]-pNPY displays even higher flexibility in the N-terminal region, back-folding can be safely excluded for both peptides. The data for bPP and [pNPY19-23]-hPP are virtually indistinguishable and clearly document rigidly back-folded peptides as described for bPP (8, 18). The differences of corresponding values for bPP and [pNPY19-23]-hPP are generally smaller than the error margins for determining those values. Taking into account the high flexibility of [hPP19-23]pNPY we decided to not further structurally characterize the

chimeric peptides in the absence of a membrane model but limit our investigations to the prove that changes in backfolding propensities were not introduced by the mutations. Properties of Micelle-Bound Peptides. Structures. As mentioned before, the 15N{1H}-NOE gives information on the internal backbone dynamics of a peptide. The values for the four peptides bound to DPC micelles are presented in Figure 2. In general all peptides are segregated into a wellfolded and into a flexible part. At the N terminus the negative values indicate flexibility, whereas in the R-helical segment in the C-terminal part positive values are observed confirming a rigid structure. The raw NMR data as presented by the proton-proton NOEs and the 3JHNR indicate overall similarity of pNPY and [hPP19-23]-pNPY with subtle changes occurring at the N-terminal part of the R-helix (see Supporting Information). Although all R, i,i+3 NOEs are found in both peptides for i ) 15 to 18, pNPY additionally displays a NOE between HR12 and H 15. The 3JHNR scalar couplings display slightly larger values for [hPP19-23]-pNPY when compared to pNPY, in particular in the segment 14-16, for which they are below 6 Hz for pNPY in contrast to the chimeras. The differences in the values of the 15N{1H}-NOE are only minor; they nevertheless add further evidence to the view that the helix of the chimera in its N-terminal part is not as stable as in the parent peptide. The energy-minimized conformers of [hPP19-23]-pNPY were R-helical between residues Leu17 and Thr32. In most of the structures HNi+4 f COi hydrogen bonds are present in the segment between Asp16 and Thr32, with the exception

of Ala18-Ala22, which is probably caused by severe peak overlap for protons of the two residues thereby reducing the number of available restrains. In the R-helical segment Leu17-Thr32 the RMSD is 0.42 ((0.18) Å for the backbone heavy atoms. [hPP19-23]-pNPY has 15N{1H}-NOE values similar to those of pNPY, which at the C terminus only a slightly decrease, supporting the view that the helical structure extends up to Tyr36. The superposition of the NMR ensemble of [hPP19-23]pNPY is displayed in Figure 3. Upon comparing pNPY and [hPP19-23]-pNPY the most important difference observed in the computed structures is that in pNPY the helix starts at Ala14, whereas Leu17 presents the first helical residue in the chimera. The different starting positions for the helix are well supported by differences in observed hydrogen bond patterns, as pNPY displays an additional HNi+4 f COi hydrogen bond between residues 14-18. In the region 1732, which is R-helical in all structures of both peptides, the RMSDs for the backbone atoms are of comparable magnitude. In pNPY regular HNi+4 f COi hydrogen bonds occur up to Tyr36, but only up to Thr32 in [hPP19-23]-pNPY, for which an additional HNi+3 f COi hydrogen bond is found between residues 31 and 34. The latter indicates a more 310 helical character toward the C terminus, but the 15N{1H}NOEs (see Figure 2) and RMSDs (see Table 4) reveal no evidence for higher flexibility in this part. Comparing [pNPY19-23]-hPP and bPP, again subtle differences are observed in the raw NMR data of residues of the N-terminal segment of the R-helix. All R, i,i+3 NOEs are found in both peptides for i ) 15 to 18. In [pNPY19-23]hPP additional medium range NOEs between the -protons of residue 12 or HR of residue 13 and the - or -protons of residues 16 and 17 are found (the latter is Very weak in bPP).

For residues 16 to 18 the 3JHNR couplings are smaller. Similarly to the situation in NPY/[hPP19-23]-pNPY scalar couplings in the segment 12-13 are unchanged. Furthermore, we measured higher 15N{1H}-NOEs for [pNPY19-23]-hPP in that segment (see inset in Figure 2). Examination of the energy-minimized structures of [pNPY19-23]-hPP revealed an R-helix between Met17 and Leu31 in all structures (see Figure 3 for a superposition of the NMR ensemble). However, in most of the conformers the helix already begins at Pro14. The HNi+4 f COi hydrogen bonds are present in almost all of the structures in the segment from Gln16 to Thr32. Additional hydrogen bonds are found between Thr13-Met17 and Pro14-Ala18. At the N and C termini of the helix HNi+3 f COi hydrogen bonds exist, too. Best convergence of the resulting structures was observed for the region 17-31 with RMSD values of 0.30 ((0.19) Å for the backbone heavy atoms, and only slightly increases upon including residues 14-31 to a value of 0.41 ((0.20) Å (see also Table 4). We conclude that the helix starts at Pro14 and is longer when compared to the parental peptide bPP. We like to emphasize here that the extension of the helix is well reflected in higher values for the heteronuclear NOE (see inset in Figure 2). The structure comparison of bPP and [pNPY19-23]-hPP reveals high similarity for the helical segment. However as mentioned above, the R-helix is N-terminally extended in [pNPY19-23]-hPP. In 14 out of 20 structures the helix in [pNPY19-23]-hPP already starts at residue 14, whereas for bPP this extended helix is an exception. This difference is also reflected in the weaker increase in RMSD values upon including residues 14-16 for [pNPY19-23]-hPP compared to PP. Otherwise, bPP and [pNPY19-23]-hPP are very similar in the helical segment encompassing residues 17 to 31 with backbone RMSDs of 0.31 ((0.14) Å for PP and 0.30 ((0.19) Å for the chimera. Another obvious difference is the fact that the helical fold extends further to the C terminus in [pNPY19-23]-hPP with the consequence that the termini seem to point into different directions. We more closely investigated this apparent difference and noticed that the HN shifts of residues 30 and 33 are highly overlapped in bPP but not in the chimeric peptide. Due to this overlap a number of i,i+3 restraints sampled in the case of the chimera are absent in bPP so that the last helical turn is missing in bPP. We therefore believe that this difference is an artifact due to a lack of restraints in bPP in that particular part. Again, we

like to emphasize the importance of the 15N{1H}-NOE (Figure 2), which up to Arg33 assumes very similar values in the two peptides. Nevertheless, it is perfectly clear that the terminal tripeptide is much more rigid in pNPY or [hPP19-23]-pNPY when compared to bPP or [pNPY19-23]hPP, both of which contain Pro at position 34. Orientation on the Membrane. To probe the spatial orientation of the peptides on the micelle surface we conducted spin-label experiments as previously described by us (12). Figure 4 shows the relative residual signal intensities of the two chimeric and their parental peptides vs the sequence recorded in [15N,1H]-HSQC spectra with/without spin-label. The data of [hPP19-23]-pNPY are qualitatively similar to those of NPY with the exception of remarkably high remaining signal intensity (0.77) of Tyr27, which leads also to an extraordinarily large difference in residual signal intensities between Tyr27 and Asn29. We examined the spectra carefully but could safely exclude resonance overlap or misassignment. Similarly to the situation encountered for pNPY, no attenuation in signal intensity for residues at the N terminus could be observed. Residues Leu17, Ala21, Leu24, Arg25,Asn29, Thr32, Arg33, and Tyr36 were affected to the largest extent in [hPP19-23]-pNPY. As expected, these are mainly hydrophobic or Arg residues, the latter being frequently found at the membrane water interface (26). [pNPY19-23]-hPP exhibited values qualitatively very similar to those of bPP, however, [pNPY19-23]-hPP in general shows stronger attenuation of signal intensities than bPP. We attribute the absolute differences largely to the fact that [pNPY19-23]-hPP binds more tightly to the DPC micelle, a view that is supported by the SPR data (vide infra). For both peptides, interactions between residues of the N terminus and the micelle interface were found, in clear contrast to the situation for pNPY or its chimera. Interestingly, a slight shift in the orientation can be observed in the helical segments: residues Ala18, Ala21, and Arg25 showed strongest effects upon spin-label addition in bPP vs Ala18, Tyr20, and Leu24 in the case of the chimeric peptide. In both peptides the largest effects are seen for the C-terminal residues Thr32, Arg33, and Arg35. Moreover, hPP has a Val6, whereas in bPP a Glu is found at this position, which probably largely accounts for the stronger reductions in the N-terminal residues. As described in more detail for bPP and pNPY (12, 19) we measured H/2H exchange for both chimeras. In general the data were similar to those of their parental

Structural Features of Chimeras of NPY and PP

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 25, 2005 9261 environments are related to biological data in order to investigate which of them better agree with the relative affinities at the various Y receptors. Recently, we have shown that pNPY and pPYY, a pair of peptides with highly similar binding affinities at all Y receptors, display very different structures in solution but an almost identical fold in the micelle-bound state, indicating that it is the membrane-bound state that is recognized by the receptors (19). Herein, we investigate a pair of peptides with rather different binding properties at the receptor subtypes and find significant structural differences only in the micelle-bound state. NPY and PP have very different pharmacological profiles and structural features. The chimeric peptides demonstrate that by swapping as few as five residues between the two peptides the pharmacological properties can be dramatically altered. Because of the large differences in biological activities between the parent peptides and the chimeras and considering the fact that PP is back-folded and NPY not, we initially speculated that the changes in affinities were caused by changes in back-folding propensities introduced by swapping the segment 19-23. From the similarity in their 15 N{1H}-NOE values it is evident that bPP and [pNPY19-23]hPP are both perfectly back-folded. In contrast, pNPY clearly displays no PP-fold in solution. The 15N{1H}-NOE data reveal that [hPP19-23]-pNPY is even more flexible than pNPY. Our data, therefore, clearly show that chimeras and parent peptides possess identical back-folding propensities, when unligated in solution, and hence this feature is unlikely to account for the observed differences. To summarize the structural investigation of the micellebound states [hPP19-23]-pNPY is much more similar to its parental peptide pNPY than to bPP and for [pNPY19-23]hPP we encounter a very similar situation. Structural differences between pNPY or [hPP19-23]-pNPY and [pNPY19-23]-hPP or bPP largely account for differences in the C-terminal conformation, which are most likely due to the presence of Pro34 in the latter two. The most noticeable result of swapping the segments comprising residues 19 to 23 between pNPY and bPP (19RYYS23A in NPY vs 19QYAA23E in hPP) is the N-terminal extension of the helix in the case of [pNPY19-23]-hPP, respectively the truncation in [hPP19-23]-pNPY with respect to their parental peptides. We would like to add here that exact structures of shorter peptides, which lack a well-defined core and in which the proton density of side-chain protons is low, still present a problem and we have therefore extensively used the 15N{1H}-NOE to verify that the differences in the computed structures are real and do not present artifacts of the structure calculation. We have noticed when comparing pNPY with [pNPY19-23]-hPP that the former displays medium-range NOEs between protons of residues 12 and 15 whereas in the case of the latter NOEs between residues 12 and 16 or 17 are observed. In addition, these medium-range NOEs are absent ([hPP19-23]-pNPY) or very weak (bPP) for those peptides in which the helices are shorter and which also display lower membrane binding affinities. All data such as scalar couplings or values of the heteronuclear NOE indicate that the segment around residues 12 to 14 is not rigidly structured. However, the NOEs between residues 12 and 15 observed for NPY are compatible with a transient linear extension of the R-helix. In contrast, the NOEs between

peptides with the exception that for [pNPY19-23]-hPP even after 3 days the amide protons of residues Leu24, Tyr27, and Ile28 could still be detected, whereas for all other peptides after 1 h only weak peaks were observable (data not shown). Membrane-Binding Affinities. In case receptor binding is preceded by membrane binding large changes in the latter are expected to translate into significant changes for receptor binding. We have therefore used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy to determine the kinetic data for membrane association of the peptides at pH 6.8 in 20 mM phosphate buffer. SPR spectroscopy enables the real-time measurement of binding of the peptides to biomimetic surfaces and thereby facilitates extraction of the kinetic data for membrane association. In our studies we have coated the vesicle capture (L1) chip (a dextran matrix modified by lipophilic compounds) with DMPC or a 4:1 w/w mixture of DMPC/DMPG vesicles, with the latter mimicking partially negatively charged membranes (25). Table 3 presents the kinetic data as derived from the SPR measurements, and representative sensorgrams are depicted in Figure 5. The values for 2 are very low for bPP, pPYY, and [hPP19-23]pNPY, indicating good fits of simulated curves to the experimental data. Poorer fits were obtained for pNPY and [pNPY19-23]-hPP, which is partially due to the higher RU values but may also reflect a more complex binding mechanism for these peptides, and hence data have to be used more cautiously. As a result of our measurements we notice that the overall association rates are moderate and the spanned range of association constants is rather small. Surprisingly, binding to the zwitterionic bilayers is generally tighter than to the negatively charged bilayers except for [hPP19-23]-pNPY. DISCUSSION We have taken a structural approach to investigate whether for hormones of the NPY family membrane association precedes receptor binding as proposed by the membrane compartment theory (vide supra) (14, 15). Herein, we compare structures and internal backbone dynamics of pairs of peptides both in solution and when bound to the membrane mimicking phospholipid micelles. Structural features in both

9262 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 25, 2005 HR12 and protons from residues 16 and 17 in [pNPY19-23]hPP indicate that the turn present in the solution structure of PP, which leads to the back-fold, also exist transiently in the micelle-bound state. But it is also clear that in the membrane-mimicking environment no contacts between protons of residues 3-8 and protons from the C-terminal helix are found and hence a significant extent of back-folding can be excluded. Moreover, we did not observe mediumrange NOEs in any of the investigated peptides in the segment comprising residues 1 to 12 indicating that no residual structure exists in that part of the peptide. The reasons for the observed structural changes in the C-terminal R-helix are not absolutely clear yet. We notice that by exchanging Arg19 by Gln19 and Ala23 by Glu23 the charge in that segment is reversed. Interestingly, membrane binding generally becomes tighter once positive charges are increased, as demonstrated by biophysical methods for many membrane-active peptides (24, 25), and our SPR data recorded on the DMPC surface indicate this also to be valid in our case (vide infra). Increasing membrane-binding affinities may then via the coupled partitioning-folding mechanism (27) lead to a better-stabilized secondary structure in that segment. On the contrary, negatively charged residues like Glu have particularly unfavorable membrane partitioning properties; therefore this segment is less stabilized by membrane binding. Of course, different helix-forming propensities of the residues, e.g. the much higher propensity of Arg (28), may also contribute to the difference in helix stability observed in that part. Recently, replacement of a Glu residue in the parathyroid hormone (PTH) by Arg was reported to result in a similar helix-stabilizing effect, propagating N-terminally from the place of the mutation (29). Orientation on the Membrane and Membrane-Binding Affinity. Spin-label data of pNPY and [hPP19-23]-pNPY (Figure 4, left) indicate that the membrane interface is highly similar, and only differences for Tyr27 and Asn29 are substantial, the reason for this difference being not clear yet. His is found at position 26 in both [hPP19-23]-pNPY and pNPY, a residue for which pK values in the range between 4.9 and 6.6 in the presence of DPC micelles have been measured previously (30). A possible explanation is that the protonation state might have changed from His0 in NPY to His+ in the chimera, resulting in diminished anchoring of that residue in the interface (31). Signal attenuations for [pNPY19-23]-hPP are generally stronger than for bPP (Figure 4, right). Regardless of this point the micelle-binding topology is highly similar for bPP and [pNPY19-23]-hPP in the C-terminal pentapeptide, which is believed to be important for receptor activation. The difference in the N-terminal part of the molecules is most likely due to the additional Glu6Val point mutation. This view is supported by the fact that we measured much less reduction in that segment for a mutant of bPP, in which the strong membrane anchor Tyr7 has been replaced by Ala (data not shown). This additional membrane anchor may in principle also account for the obvious changes in rigidity as reflected in the heteronuclear NOE in the N-terminal segment. Since we also observe these changes between NPY and its chimera, for which no difference in sequence of the N-terminal segment exists, we rather attribute these (small) effects to the conformational changes at the N cap of the helix.

Lerch et al. The data for overall membrane-binding affinities as derived from our SPR measurements follow the expected trend on the neutral (zwitterionic) membranes. The overall association constants are correlated to the overall charge in the Cterminal helix: For [pNPY19-23]-hPP binding is slightly improved (Glu23 f Arg19 exchange), whereas it is reduced for [hPP19-23]-pNPY (Arg19 f Glu23 exchange). Even more importantly, partitioning of Arg residues into the membrane water interface is less unfavorable for Arg (0.81 kcal mol-1) when compared to Glu (2.2 kcal mol-1) (32). Additionally, a Tyr residue is introduced at position 21 in [pNPY19-23]hPP, a residue frequently found in the interfacial region of membranes (26). The trends in behavior for binding to negatively charged membranes are more complicated and difficult to understand. However, the differences between wild-type peptides and chimeras are much less pronounced. To conclude, differences in peptide-membrane interactions are largely due to changes in membrane affinity but not in membrane-binding topology. Structure-ActiVity Relationships. Extensive replacement studies combined with testing of receptor binding have been performed for hNPY (33), but much fewer data are available for PP (34, 35). With respect to the receptors, Walker et al. have proposed that acidic residues on the extracellular loops are involved in binding (36). For the peptides from the NPY family two features were believed to be important: First, it could be shown in the case of hNPY that the two C-terminal arginines at positions 33 and 35 are essential for receptor activation (33, 37). It is likely that they interact with the acidic receptor residues found essential for receptor activation. Second, the extraordinarily stable PP-fold, observed in the crystal (7) and solution structure (8) of PP, was believed to be an important feature for all members of this family. However it could be shown later that NPY (10, 12, 38) does not share this structural feature in solution. Although not all peptides adopt this PP-fold in solution, it could be of importance in the case of PP and PYY. In our work we therefore attribute much attention to the question whether the peptides are back-folded in solution and to the conformation of the C-terminal pentapeptide, which is most probably directly involved in receptor-binding. As NPY and PP display large differences in receptor subtype binding profiles, the question emerged whether these differences are due to the propensities of the molecules to adopt the PPfold. Although we have not explicitly solved the structures of the two chimeric peptides in solution, the 15N{1H}-NOE data unambiguously prove that the large changes in binding affinity profiles observed for the chimeric peptides are not accompanied by changes in their propensity to adopt the PPfold in solution. Therefore, changed propensities to adopt the PP-fold in solution cannot account for the observed differences in pharmacology. The introduction of the PP segment 19-23 into NPY leads to a decrease in binding affinity at all Y receptor subtypes. Surprisingly, the loss is even strongest for the Y4 and Y5 receptors, exactly those receptors that are activated by PP. This already indicates that features responsible for the (sub)nanomolar affinities of NPY toward the Y1, Y2, and Y5 subtypes and of PP toward Y4 are not maintained in [hPP19-23]-pNPY. The most prominent alteration upon introduction of the pNPY segment 19-23 into hPP is a remarkable affinity increase at the Y1 and Y2 receptors

Structural Features of Chimeras of NPY and PP indicating that some of the binding potency of NPY for the Y1 and Y2 receptor is introduced into [pNPY19-23]-hPP. At the receptor subtypes originally being targeted by PP the changes are much smaller (see Table 2). The main structural difference is the extension of the R-helix toward the N terminus. Whether this change is due to better anchoring of the N terminus of the helix onto the membrane or due to higher helix propensity caused by the introduction of an Arg residue (or both) remains unclear. Interestingly, the single point mutant [Arg19]-hPP shows similar binding profiles at the Y1 and Y5 receptors but stronger binding at the Y4 receptor when compared to [pNPY19-23]-hPP (Y2 not tested (5); exact data: unpublished results) so that we attribute most of the changes, at least at the Y1 and Y5 receptors, to the introduction of this cationic residue. CONCLUSIONS With the present knowledge it is not possible to decide whether a structural difference, namely, the extension/ truncation of the helix and/or particular side-chain interactions, is responsible for the encountered altered receptorbinding properties. The latter may also lead to altered binding affinities to the membranes. Our SPR data for neutral membranes do indeed indicate that the change in charge in that segment leads to noticeable differences for membranebinding affinities. However, the binding affinities toward the membranes are moderate only, and it is unlikely that the differences account for the observed dramatic differences in binding at the various receptor subtypes. The membrane binding constant Kassoc describes a dynamic equilibrium between peptides free in solution and when bound to the membrane. If this constant is sufficiently high, a significant part of molecules will be associated with the membrane and rebinding will occur quickly. Our preliminary data indicate that peptides from the NPY family retain their membraneinduced conformation when they dissociate from the membrane, provided they remain in the vicinity, where the solvent properties (e.g. the dielectric constant) have not changed dramatically (data not shown). Importantly, moderate binding affinities would allow the peptides to come off the membrane in order to diffuse into the receptor binding pockets while still providing enough affinity to the membrane to guide them toward the receptors and to facilitate their recognition. We have recently proposed that electrostatics, the importance of which of course depends on the exact positioning of the peptides with respect to the membrane-water interface, may play a more prominent role for recognition of these peptides by their G protein coupled receptors when compared to protein-protein (or protein-ligand) interactions in bulk solution (18). In all presently known NPY sequences a single cationic residue is found in the segment 19-23, and the same is true for all sequences of the peptide YY (PYY), which displays biological data similar to those of NPY. In contrast, almost all PP sequences contain a single anionic residue in that part of the molecule. We have also noticed that some of the extracellular loops of the Y receptors are quite different in their net charge. Whereas the conformation in the C-terminal pentapeptide has been shown to be of importance at the Y5 and Y4 receptors (but is probably also of high impact at the other receptors), the present work indicates that features of the N-terminal end of the helix are also of importance. Indeed, the observed structural differences between the wild-

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 25, 2005 9263 type peptides and their chimeras are minor and cannot fully account for the dramatic changes in their pharmacology. To which relative extent structural or electrostatic effects may trigger larger differences in binding to their receptors can only be answered when more reliable models of the structural features of the corresponding ligand-receptor complexes become available. Presently, work is in progress in our laboratory to create functional models for the Y receptors in order to study such features more directly.
