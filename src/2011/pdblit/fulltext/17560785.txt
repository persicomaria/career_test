Abstract--Y-shaped molecules bearing alkynylallylic moieties were found to be potent and selective PPARd activators. The alkynylallylic moiety was synthesized from alkyn-1-ols by hydroalumination followed by a cross-coupling reaction. Series of active compounds 6 were obtained by stepwise changing the structure of the known PPARpan agonist 5 into Y-shaped compounds. The most active and selective compound, 6f, had a PPARd potency of 0.13 lM, which is 50-fold more potent than compound 5. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor gene superfamily.1,2 They play a central role in regulating the storage and catabolism of dietary fat. There are three PPAR subtypes: PPARa, PPARc, and PPARd.3 Synthetic ligands for PPARa and PPARc have been known for decades and the function of the receptors is well studied.4­6 The human PPARd receptor was cloned in the early 1990s7 and many research groups have been trying to prepare selective ligands to study the biological function and possible application in human therapy. PPAR agonist can be regarded to consist of three parts: a head group, a linker, and a lipophilic tail group. The head group may consist of a phenyl ring bearing a carboxylate functionality.9 Examination of the ligand-binding domain in the PPARd receptor revealed a Y-shaped pocket. One of the first selective and potent PPARd agonists was GW501516 (1).8 Recently, agonist 2 was found by optimization of hits from a high-throughput screening.9,10 The structure of compound 3 fitted the cavity of the receptor well, according to docking experiment into a co-crystal structure of the PPARd ligand-binding domain and GW2433.11,14 This finding is in an agreeKeywords: Nuclear receptor; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor d; PPAR agonists; Hydroalumination; Substituted allyl alcohols. * Corresponding author.

ment with Epple's recent finding, where Y-shaped 1,3,5-trisubstituted aryls (e.g., 4) were found to be potent and selective d agonists (Fig. 1).12 We investigated the possibility to obtain selective PPARd agonists by stepwise changing the structure of the known PPARpan agonist 5,13 with first the head group of 1 and then with a Y-shaped tail group consisting of the conformationally restricted phenylalkynylallyl getting compounds of the general structure 6 (Fig. 2).

The alkynylallylic tail group was synthesized using a method leading to substituted allylic alcohols with defined stereochemistry. The preparation of the allyliodide intermediate (8) was accomplished using hydroalumination15 followed by a cross-coupling reaction (Scheme 1). The stereochemistry was set-up by formation of the cyclic hydroalumination product. After quench of this product with iodine the (Z)-3-iodoallylic alcohol was obtained (8). The configuration was retained during the subsequent Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions giving alkynylallylic alcohols (9). Coupling with the phenol head group, 10, was accomplished under Mitsunobu reaction condition to give the ester 11, which was hydrolyzed to the desired carboxylic acid 12 (Scheme 2). Thioether 6a was prepared by conversion of allylic alcohol 9 into bromide and subsequent reaction with thiol 13. Hydrolysis of the ester afforded the acid 6a. An alternative method was developed in the preparation of some acids 6. 3-Iodoallylic alcohol 8 was coupled first with the head group 13 or 15 followed by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction to give 14.16 This methodology allowed the preparation of a wide number of different compounds in the late stage of the synthesis. It was also found that the coupling with head groups 13 or 15 gave a better yield using a two-step approach, than

the one-step Mitsunobu reaction. First the alcohol was converted to the allyllic bromide and then the bromine was substituted with thiophenolate (salt of 13) or with phenolate (salt of 15). Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 was used as a catalyst for Sonogashira reaction. This catalyst was selective for the reaction with vinylic iodine of 16 over the aromatic bromide (14d­m). This selectivity was not obtained using the Fu catalytic conditions (t-Bu3P, Pd(PhCN)2Cl2).17 The aromatic bromine in 14d was used for the synthesis of 6n. For this reaction the modified Fu conditions18,19 using thiophen stannane20 were used. Preparations of thioether analogs using 13 were only accomplished with a few substituents. The stability of thioethers depended for unknown reason on the substituents. E.g. compounds 6a and b were successively prepared, whereas the preparation of the compounds 6r­t (Fig. 3) failed, due to decomposition of final compounds. A few heteroaromatic derivatives were also synthesized. The starting propargylic alcohols (7) were prepared

Compounds were tested in at least three separate experiments in at least five concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 30 lM. EC50 is the concentration giving 50% of the maximal activity observed for a given compound. For each compound the efficacy (% max) is given as a relative compared to the maximal activity of NNC 61-4655 (5) for PPARa, Rosiglitazone for PPARc and Carbacyclin for PPARd. The results are expressed as means and ± SEM was less than 15%. If a plateau was not reached at the highest concentration of compound tested (30 lM), the effect at this concentration was calculated, and the maximal effect is indicted to be grater than this value. In such cases the EC50 was assigned as >10 lM. If the maximal effect of a compound was less than 10% no EC50 could be calculated.

from the haloaromatics21 by Sonogashira reaction.22 Hydroalumination reaction gave again isomerically pure intermediates 8. The yields of the reactions were how-

ever lower than in the previous cases. Next steps were performed by standard procedures, except for the synthesis of the quinoline derivative, where iodoalcohol 8

group, exhibited a similar activity profile as 6d. Replacement of the bromophenyl group (Ar group, Table 1) with a heteroaryl group did not change the activity significantly (6n vs. 6d; 6o vs. 6i). The quinoline derivative gained PPARd activity but lost the selectivity (6q vs. 6d). The benzofuran derivatives 6o and p exhibited good activity and selectivity. Compound 6f, which exhibited good PPARd potency and good selectivity, was docked into the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of the PPARd receptor crystallized with GW2433 (1GWX).14,26 The Y-shaped molecule 6f adopted similar conformation as the PPAR pan-agonist GW2433 (Fig. 4). The reduced conformational flexibility of 6f in comparison to GW2433 resulted in higher PPARd selectivity. Lipophilic Br and CF3 groups attached on the phenyl rings helped better filling up the hydrophobic cavity. Electronic effects of both the substituents also played the role in the charge distribution in the tail group and thus in interactions between ligand and the cavity of the receptor. In conclusion, Y-shaped compounds of the general structure 6 were found to be selective and potent PPARd activators. Good activity and selectivity was obtained by proper combination of both substituents on the allylic tail group. Compound 6f exhibited good PPARd potency combined with good selectivity.

was converted into allylic chloride by reaction with thionyl chloride in CH2Cl2. The structural starting point was the known compound 5, which is a PPARpan agonist with high PPARa potency.13 Replacement of the head group (the moiety bearing the carboxyl) with the one being used in GW501516 (1) decreased a and c activity25 giving the dual PPARa, d agonist, 17 (Fig. 2). Modification of the tail group of compound 5 with the Y-shaped alkynylallylic group gave compound 12 which had decreased the PPARa, c, and d potency. The combination of both ``new'' head and tail group, gave a selective PPARd agonist (6c) with low potency. Bromine substitution on the tail group (6d) increased the PPARd potency. The thioether analog 6a exhibited even higher PPARd potency. The synthesis of a series of thioether analogs of compound 6a was attempted, but many of the thioethers were unstable and decomposed during the work-up. Compound 6b was one of few stable compounds which exhibited very good PPARd potency (Table 1). Because of the instability of thioethers attention was turned back to ether bridged compounds. A large set of alkynylallylic ethers with diverse substituents were synthesized and screened (Table 1). Introduction of a hydrophobic bromine group in the Ar group in 6c gave compound 6d with improved PPARd activity. This reflected that the hydrophobic pocket was better filled up by the bromophenyl group compared with the unsubstituted phenyl ring. In the series of compounds 6d­m, only the acetylenic substituent (R) was altered. Many compounds exhibited higher potency and efficacy on PPARd activity compared to 6d, while good selectivity was retained. Generally, aromatic and non-polar substituents exhibited good activity (6d­g, i), while bulky substituents and polar groups decreased the activity (6k­m). Compound 6h had a different substitution pattern in the phenyl ring and this resulted in a decreased PPARd potency. Compound 6j, having an OH

General procedure for the preparation of compounds 6.Hydroalumination (the preparation of iodide 8): NaOMe (0.027 g, 0.5 mmol) was added to a 1 M solution of LiAlH4 in THF (6 mL, 6 mmol). The mixture was cooled to 0 °C and a solution of the appropriate alk-2-yn-1-ol (7) 22,23 (5 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was slowly added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h under nitrogen atmosphere at 0 °C and dimethyl carbonate (0.7 mL, 8 mmol) or ethyl acetate (1 mL, 10 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h without cooling, then cooled to 0 °C and a solution of iodine (1.52 g, 6 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was added. The mixture was left in a refrigerator (4 °C) overnight. Then MeOH (2 mL) was added, the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at rt and poured into water, acidified with HCl, and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 · 50 mL). Combined organic layers were washed with aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate (5%, 100 mL) to remove excess of iodine, dried with sodium sulfate, and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel) giving substituted 3-iodoprop-2-en-1-ol. E.g. (Z)-3-(4bromophenyl)-3-iodo-prop-2-en-1-ol was obtained in 84% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): 7.47­7.42 (m, 2H); 7.36­7.31 (m, 2H); 6.25 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 1H); 4.37 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 2H); 1.86 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 1H). Alkylation of phenol 15 or thiophenol 13: Method A. Methyl (4-hydroxy-2-methylphenoxy) acetate (15)8 (1.17 g, 5.96 mmol), triphenylphosphine (1.70 g, 6.48 mmol), and allylic alcohol (8 or 9) were dissolved in the mixture of anhydrous toluene (90 mL) and THF (30 mL). Diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (1.2 mL, 6.05 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was added dropwise under nitrogen atmosphere at 0 °C over 20 min. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo and the residue was submitted to flash column chromatography (silica gel) giving the desired ether. E.g. Methyl (Z)-[4-[3iodo-3-(2-methylbenzo[b]furan-5-yl)allyloxy]-2-methylphenoxy] acetate (16o) was obtained in 59% yield. Mp: 74­77 °C; 1 H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): 7.59 (bd, J = 1.5 Hz, 1H); 7.35 (dd, J = 8.6 and 1.8 Hz, 1H); 7.32 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 1H); 6.80 (bd, J = 2.1 Hz, 1H); 6.72-6.66 (m, 2H); 6.36 (s, 1H); 6.28 (t, J = 5.1 Hz, 1H); 4.71 (d, J = 5.1 Hz, 2H); 4.61 (s, 2H); 3.80 (s, 3H); 2.45 (s, 3H); 2.29 (s, 3H).

Method B. Allylic alcohol (8 or 9) (2.8 mmol), carbon tetrabromide (0.913 g, 3 mmol), and triphenylphosphine (0.786 g, 3 mmol) were mixed in anhydrous dichloromethane(10 mL) and the mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 3 h and then at 20 °C overnight. Ether (50 mL) and hexanes (30 mL) were added and the mixture was filtered through a pad of silica gel to remove precipitated triphenylphosphine oxide. The mixture was concentrated in vacuo and crude allylic bromide was subsequently used without further purification. Obtained compound (2 mmol), phenol 158 (0.652 g, 2 mmol), and cesium carbonate (0.65 g, 2 mmol) were stirred in acetonitrile (25 mL) at 20 °C overnight. The mixture was filtered and concentrated. The residue was submitted to column chromatography (silica gel). The product was obtained in 60­80% yield. E.g. (Z)-[4-[3-(4bromophenyl)-3-iodoallyloxy]-2-methylphenoxy] acetate (13d) was prepared in 71% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): 7.46­7.42 (m, 2H); 7.37­7.32 (m, 2H); 6.78 (s, 1H), 6.68 (d, J = 1.5 Hz, 2H); 6.35 (t, J = 5.0 Hz, 1H); 4.68 (d, J = 5.0 Hz, 2H); 4.61 (s, 2H); 3.80 (s, 3H); 2.29 (s, 3H). The alkylation of thiophenol 1324 was performed in CH2Cl2/THF mixture (5:6) under exclusion of oxygen with DIPEA as a base. Method C. (Z)-3-Iodo-3-(quinoline-3-yl)prop-2-en-1-ol (8q, 1.061 g, 3.41 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (15 mL) and thionyl chloride (0.45 mL, 6 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred for 5 h at ambient temperature. The solvent and excess of thionyl chloride were removed in vacuo and sufficiently pure crude hydrochloride of (Z)-3-iodo-3-(quinoline-3-yl)allyl chloride was obtained. This product (0.704 g, 1.9 mmol), phenol 15 (0.392 g, 2.0 mmol), and cesium carbonate (1.304 g, 4 mmol) were mixed in acetonitrile (15 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred for 3 days. The work-up procedure was as described in Method B. Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction, the preparation of compounds 9 and 14a, d­m, o­q: Iododerivative 8 or 16a, d­m, o­q (0.77 mmol), terminal alkyne (R-CCH) (1.54 mmol), and diisopropylamine (0.51 mL, 3.6 mmol) were dissolved in THF (15 mL). The solution was degassed; CuI (15 mg, 0.075 mmol) and PdCl2(PPh3)2 (30 mg, 0.042 mmol) were added; the reaction mixture was degassed again and then stirred under inert atmosphere at 65 °C. The reaction was monitored by TLC. When the conversion was completed the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and filtered through a pad of silica gel. The pad was washed with ethyl acetate and the combined filtrates were concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by column chromatography giving desired product in high yield. E.g. Methyl (Z)-[4-[3-(4-bromophenyl)-5-(4trifluoromethylphenyl)pent-2-en-4-ynyloxy]-2-methylphenoxy] acetate (14f) was obtained in 96% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): 7.53­7.48 (m, 4H); 7.45 (dm,J = 8.6 Hz, 2H); 7.35 (dm, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H); 6.82 (d, J = 2.8 Hz, 1H); 6.72 (dd, J = 8.8 and 2.9 Hz, 1H); 6.68­ 6.60 (m, 2H); 4.97 (d, J = 6.3 Hz, 2H); 4.60 (s, 2H); 3.80 (s, 3H); 2.28 (s, 3H). Hydrolysis of esters: ester ($0.3 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of THF (3 mL) and MeOH (1 mL), and aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (22 mg, 0.5 mmol, 1 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred for 2 h and then diluted with saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride (20 mL). The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 · 15 mL); the organic layers were combined and dried with sodium sulfate. The compound was either crystallized or chromatographed on silica gel. E.g. (Z)-[4-[3-(4-bromophenyl)-5-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl) pent-2-en-4-ynyloxy]-2-methylphenoxy] acetic acid (6f) was obtained in 75% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3,

Compound 14d (216 mg, 0.440 mmol) and tributyl-(5-methylthiophen-2yl)tin [20] (223 mg, 0.576 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (10 mL), the solution was degassed and put under nitrogen. Pd2dba3ÆCHCl3 (15.4 mg, 0.015 mmol) and t-Bu3P in cyclohexane (0.15 M, 0.40 mL, 0.060 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 90 min, cooled down, and 10% aqueous solution of potassium fluoride was added. The mixture was stirred for 10 min, filtered through a pad of silica gel and the silica gel was washed with ethyl acetate (50 mL). The filtrate was washed with brine (3 · 15 mL), 10% aqueous solution of potassium fluoride (2 · 10 mL), water (2 · 10 mL), and brine (3 · 15 mL). The organic solution was dried with sodium sulfate, concentrated and purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, hexanes/ethyl acetate 10:1). The crude product was triturated with hexanes/ethyl acetate mixture (15:1, 16 mL) yielding methyl (Z)-[2methyl-4-[3-[4-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)phenyl]-5-phenylpent2- en-4-ynyloxy]phenoxy] acetate (14n) as a yellowish amorphous mass in 47% yield.
