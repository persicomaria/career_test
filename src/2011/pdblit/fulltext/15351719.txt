The Alkali Molten Globule State of Horse Ferricytochrome c: Observation of Cold Denaturation
Rajesh Kumar, N. Prakash Prabhu, D. Krishna Rao and Abani K. Bhuyan
School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad 500046, India Here, we present the basic structural properties and the thermodynamic description of a previously unknown alkali molten globule state of horse "ferricytochrome c". Both sodium and guanidinium cations stabilize the alkali-denatured state at pH 13, presumably by a charge screening mechanism. The Na+-stabilized conformation (B state) clearly meets with the molecular organizational definition of the generic molten globule state. The B state exhibits highly cooperative thermal unfolding transitions monitored by both near and far-UV CD. Analyses of these transitions show substantial heat capacity change, suggesting that the hydrophobic effect contributes considerably to its energetic stability. At low salt concentration where molten globules are less stable, the B state undergoes reversible cold denaturation.

Introduction
The molten globule (MG) state, classically defined as "a compact and largely mobile molecular state containing native-like secondary structure and hydrodynamic radius, but without rigid tertiary structure" is now considered a distinct thermodynamic state of proteins.1­3 The MG state is important in the protein folding area, because it generally corresponds to late folding intermediates,2,4,5 which under normal folding conditions at neutral pH are difficult to study because of their transient lifetime. For structural studies, they are stabilized and populated at extremes of pH by the use of added counterions. The MG state is also important for protein function in the living cell.1,6 In

recent years, a class of intrinsically disordered proteins that resemble MG and lack tertiary structure has been studied in some detail.7­11 These proteins, the abundance of which increases with evolution and complexity of organisms,8 are involved in cell signaling and regulatory function by protein­DNA and protein­protein interactions.12­16 In general, the unstructured regions of the MG-like intrinsically disordered proteins undergo unstructured-to-folded transitions when bound to target sites. Another most recent example of their implication in protein function is the demonstration that a pH-dependent molten globule transition is required for activity of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein that stimulates steroid biosynthesis,17 The MG state has also served as a paradigm in studies of temperature function of protein stability, since pHdestabilized states in the presence of salt are amenable to cold denaturation in the experimentally accessible low temperatures.18,19 Thus, the study of the MG state continues to be a thrust area in experimental protein research. Evidently, molten globules have been documented for a large set of proteins.1­3 Test-tube studies of ion-stabilized molten globules require one of the following two transitions: UA  A and UB  B, where UA and UB are acid and base-denatured proteins, respectively, and A and B are the corresponding MG states. In most cases, the A state has been studied in the presence of anions; the

484 complementary cation-stabilized B state has received meager attention. In fact, the B state has been described for only a very few proteins, including -lactamase,22 and barstar.23 More specifically, the B state of ferricytochrome c (ferricyt c) remained unnoticed, even though the first conclusive evidence for the existence of the MG state was based on some detailed experiments with the A state of ferricyt c.18,21,24­29 Realizing this deficiency in the perspective of the importance of the molten globule state, we have recently performed a series of experiments with alkali-denatured cytochrome c (cyt c). In the first set of studies, we used the carbonmonoxy derivative of the reduced form of cyt c (ferrocyt c) at pH 13, and achieved the UB  B transition in the presence of Na+.30 Those experiments were difficult because ferrocyt c hardly denatures even at the extreme of basic pH, and therefore the CO adduct was used. Here, we present the second set of experiments with ferricyt c where the UB state is directly prepared at

pH 13, and the UB  B transition is achieved in the presence of NaCl. The B state of ferricyt c exhibits all of the basic physical and structural properties known for the A state. Interestingly, in the presence of a lower concentration of salt the B state shows a cold denaturation transition, as does the A state.18 Analyses of the thermal transitions suggest that the hydrophobic effect might contribute substantially toward the energetic stability of the B state.

Results

485 medium though, the four tyrosine residues of cyt c are also expected to contribute to the fluorescence of the protein, since the excitation wavelength employed here (280 nm) serves to excite the tyrosinate side-chain as well. Similarly, the emission maximum due to the W59 fluorescence closely coincides with that for the tyrosinates. We have checked this using 9 and 18 M solutions of L-tyrosine at pH 13 (data not shown). We also note that the fluorescence intensity of the denatured protein at pH 13 is at least twofold less than at pH 7, possibly due to either quenching by hydroxyl ions or ionization of the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine. In fact, alkaline quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine fluorescence has been known for a long time. In spite of these two effects of alkaline pH, the total observed fluorescence could still be used as a marker of molecular compaction of alkaline cyt c, because one is interested to know if the emission is quenched, presumably because of increasing proximity of the fluorophores and the heme as the Na+ concentration in the medium increases. Also, because all experiments are performed at pH 13, the effect of alkali on the fluorescence is expected to be uniform for all samples. The emission observed for the alkali-denatured cyt c (UB) held at pH 13 (Figure 1(b), spectrum 3) decreases when 2 M NaCl is included (spectrum 2), indicating the formation of the B state. The nativestate spectrum at pH 7 is of course fully quenched (spectrum 1). The Figure also shows that the UB state considered here is not as expanded as the unfolded state is, since the fluorescence of UB increases considerably in the presence of 5 M GdnHCl (spectrum 5). This is not unexpected, since pHdenatured states in general are partially compact. Similarly, the B state undergoes molecular expansion in the presence of GdnHCl (spectrum 6), indicating global unfolding of the molten globule. The titration curve of Figure 1(c) shows NaClinduced molecular compaction of UB. The data, normalized with respect to the fluorescence of the initial UB state and fitted to an expression similar to equation (1), indicate binding of one or two Na+ ions. A value of 1.75 for the difference in the number of cations bound between the UB state and the B state was also estimated from the relation: n = B lnKapp/B ln ax, where Kapp is the observed equilibrium constant for the salt induced transition, and ax is the activity of the ligand. MG states have substantial content of secondary structure, often comparable to that in the native states.1,36 The CD spectra in Figure 1(d) show secondary structure content in the relevant protein states. At 222 nm, the molar residue ellipticity (MRE) for the GdnHCl-unfolded cyt c at pH 7 is about -1260. The value for the UB state at pH 13 is - 5653, indicating that this state is not fully unfolded. Considerable residual secondary structure characterizes the UB state. With increments of NaCl the secondary structure is strengthened. Spectra 2 and 3 show the changes induced by NaCl. In the presence of 2 M NaCl (spectrum 3), the MRE value is

unfolded-state fluorescence. Interestingly, the CD222monitored transition not only shifts to a distinctly higher pH, but also indicates that the protein retains at least 40% of the native-state helical structure even at pH 13.5. The base-denatured state (pH  13) with these structural properties is referred to as the UB state. But the observed non-coincidence of the pH transitions monitored by fluorescence and CD222, a result consistent with an earlier report of the response of ferricyt c to alkali exposure,31 provides the classic evidence for the presence of an equilibrium intermediate.32 We label this base-denatured intermediate IB1. The fact that the UB state possesses nearly a half of the native-state helical structure, but is dimensionally expanded sets the stage for the molten globule study reported herein. In fact, the early discovery of the molten globule state of proteins was based on the observation that the acid-pH form of -lactalbumin33 structurally resembles an intermediate form of the protein which populates in guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)induced transition at neutral pH. 34 In general, intermediates may not accumulate in denaturantinduced transitions, but it has been shown for a sizable set of proteins that extremes of pH can transform proteins into a state possessing optical parameters similar to those of often elusive denaturant-induced intermediates.1 The alkali-pH transitions of ferricyt c (Figure 1(a)) thus indicate that the UB state could possibly be stabilized and transformed by cations to the alkali molten globule state, B, for structural characterization. This possibility is readily tested. The inset to Figure 1(a) shows that the fluorescence-monitored alkali-denaturation transition of cyt c shifts toward higher pH with increments of Na+. Whereas the titration is apparently complete at pH 13 in the saltless medium, just about 40% molecules are denatured in the presence of 1.5 M NaCl. The fit to the data by the use of the equation: y¼ cu þ cf t10nðpHÀCmÞb 1 þ 10nðpHÀCmÞ ð1Þ

where cu and cf are normalized fluorescence signals for the unfolded and the refolded state, respectively, n is the number of OH­ titrated, and cm is the pHmidpoint for the transition, indicates the titration of roughly three OH ­ . This suggests that cations increase the stability of the protein under denaturing alkaline conditions. Ion-stabilized denatured states generally fall in the category of the MG state.1,13 In the following experiments, we show that ferricyt c at extreme alkaline pH and high NaCl indeed exists as a state that is not just a mixture of the native and the unfolded state, but is distinguishable as a molten globule because it displays a combination of properties of the two states. The MG state is nearly as compact as the native state.1 Na+-driven molecular compaction of cyt c is easily verified by fluorescence emission due to the lone tryptophan, since compact states of cyt c are less fluorescent due to excitation energy transfer from W59 to the heme.26,35 In highly alkaline

486 comparable with that for the native protein at pH 7, suggesting that the MG state is fully formed. Typically, far-UV CD spectra of proteins in the MG state are similar to those of the native states.36 The control CD spectra were recorded at pH 7, because the spectra at pH 13 are obscured when GdnHCl is added to the protein solution (see below). Figure 1(e) shows the variation of the 222-nm MRE with NaCl in the 0­2.5 M range. The transition involves titration of one or two Na+ ions. Clearly, alkali-denatured cyt c acquires extensive secondary structure in high ionic strength medium, suggesting the occurrence of the UB  B transition. Figure 1(f) presents the relevant aromatic CD spectra. The spectra for the GdnHCl-unfolded protein (70 M) at pH 7 and the base-denatured protein at pH 13 are nearly identical; no CD absorption is observed at 282 and 289 nm, indicating that the UB state is equivalent to the unfolded state in terms of the near-UV CD signature. However, the spectrum for the B state (+ 2 M NaCl; Figure 1(f))

B State of Ferricyt c

appears to indicate a little gain in the CD absorption. To summarize, the basic data (Figure 1(b)­(e)) suggest that the fraction of the molten globule state at pH 13 and 2 M salt is roughly 0.9. Further, the protein concentration used for various spectroscopic probes differed widely, according to the transition dipole strength of spectroscopic probes, spanning the range 9 M­70 M. In spite of this difference, the properties and parameters derived from these data and also from those presented below are consistent with the known properties of molten globules. The invariance to protein concentration suggests that the observed attribute of the state is unlikely due to protein aggregate or a non-monomeric form.37 By definition, the MG state shows increased internal mobility and side-chain environmental averaging.1,24 Selected regions of the basic NMR spectra presented in Figure 2 check these properties. For native ferricyt c (pH 7, no salt), the resonances are narrow and well-dispersed (Figure 2(a)). At pH 13 where the protein denatures, both chemical shift

For clarity, only selected regions of aromatic, aliphatic, and heme substituent resonances are shown. The panels at the bottom show sections of phase-sensitive NOESY spectra: MG, the molten globule or the B state (pH 13), 2 M NaCl; N, the native state at pH 7, no salt. All spectra were taken at 22 °C.

B State of Ferricyt c

487 To summarize the results, base denaturation transforms ferricyt c to an intermediate, IB1, in the region of pH 12.5. At pH  13, IB1 loses more helical structure and transforms to the extreme basedenatured state, UB, that still retains  40% of helical structure. By adding NaCl up to 2 M, the UB state at pH 13 can be converted to the molten globule state, B, which has native-like secondary structure, a small amount of tertiary structure, and a compact size. GdnHCl-induced stabilization and subsequent unfolding of the UB state: detection of another equilibrium intermediate The initial objective of this experiment was to estimate the extent of structure retained by the alkali-denatured state (UB). So, we performed a GdnHCl titration of cyt c at pH 13 in the absence of NaCl, and monitored the structural changes by fluorescence (Figure 3). An interesting behavior is observed: as the concentration of GdnHCl is raised, the fluorescence initially decreases in a sharp cooperative manner, and then increases relatively monotonously displaying a very weak unfolding transition (Figure 3(b)). GdnHCl-induced folding transitions for the acid-denatured forms of cyt c,

dispersion and lineshape are substantially lost (Figure 2(d)). When NaCl is included in the unfolded protein solution, the spectrum appears to regain partly both dispersion and sharpness of resonances, shown selectively for the aromatic and aliphatic resonances, and for the heme methyl resonances diagnostic of alkaline ferricyt c.38­41 At pH > 9.3 where the M80 ligand is replaced by a lysine ligand, the heme substituents of cyt c exhibit large chemical shifts, which is the basis for the assignments40 indicated in Figure 2(b). Relative to the resonances in the native-state spectrum (spectrum a), the resonances in the B-state spectra (spectra b and c) are broad all over the aliphatic and aromatic regions. However, the observation that the B-state resonances are still not markedly broad suggests that the molten globule interrogated here is perhaps not excessively mobile and that it retains traces of rigid tertiary structure. The phase-sensitive nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum for the B state (pH 13, 2 M NaCl) presented at the bottom of Figure 2 (labeled MG) shows a good number of long-range NOE interactions involving aliphatic and aromatic side-chains, indicating the presence of some tertiary structure. For comparison, the native state spectrum (pH 7; labeled N) is also shown.

488 myoglobin, and a synthetic amphiphilic peptide have been reported.42 In the present case, the initial folding transition (Figure 3(a)) is attributed to a GdnH+-mediated UB  IB2 transition, where IB2 is a structural intermediate. Although the IB2 intermediate is more compact than the UB state (Figure 3(b)), it is more expanded than the B state (compare Figures 1(c) and 3(b)). Assuming that GdnHCl exerts its effect by direct protein­denaturant interaction,43­45 the number of GdnH+ ions associated with the UB  IB2 transition can be estimated for a model where IB2 interacts preferentially with the GdnH+ ions with the assumption that the binding constants for interaction of these cations with different binding sites offered by the IB2 state are comparable.21 The fit of the initial folding transition data to the expression: Kapp ¼ Kð1 þ Kbind ax ÞDn ð2Þ

of alkaline ferricyt c.31 Nevertheless, as shown in Figure 3(c) and (d)), the increase of 282-nm CD absorption with increasing concentration of GdnHCl up to 0.4 M is an indication of the UB  IB2 transition. Denaturant unfolding and conformational stability of the B state In order to have a better understanding of the conformational stability of the orthodox B state stabilized by Na+, we performed another set of GdnHCl titration of the B state stabilized by the addition of 2 M NaCl at pH 13, a suggestion offered by one of the reviewers of this paper. Figure 3(e) shows the data. Assuming that the B  U unfolding

where n is the difference of the number of GdnH+ ions bound to UB and IB2 states, ax is the activity of GdnHCl, Kbind is the binding constant, and K is the true equilibrium constant for the UBIB2 transition in the absence of GdnHCl, yields n  2.2, Kb  200, and K  4.2. At 22 °C, the value of K corresponds to the free energy of 0.84 kcal mol- 1. Above 0.5 M GdnHCl, the stabilizing effect of the GdnH+ ions is overrun by their own unfolding action. The unfolding transition of the IB2 state is apparently shallow (Figure 3(b)), indicating small amount of solvent exposure of residues accompanying the unfolding process (IB2  U). This suggests that IB2 lacks a significant hydrophobic core although patches of exposed and buried hydrophobic surfaces may be present. The GdnHCl titration data were fit to:28   u 1 þ Kbind ½GdnHCl n DG ¼ DG- À RTln B 1 þ Kbind ½GdnHCl ð3Þ À m½GdnHCl where m is the equilibrium surface exposure of residues during unfolding, n is the number of GdnH+ binding sites, Kubind and KBbind are binding constants of GdnH+ to the unfolded and the IB2 state, respectively, and G° is the free energy of unfolding in the absence of the denaturant. The fit yields m = 0.35( ± 0.02) kcal mol - 1 M - 1 and G° = 1.02( ± 0.11) kcal mol - 1 . Compared with values reported for the unfolding of the A state of cyt c (1.61 kcal mol- 1 M- 1 and 2.04 kcal mol- 1, respectively),42 the present results show that the GdnH+-stabilized IB2 state is relatively less stable. The GdnHCl-induced UB  IB2 transition should be verifiable by CD as well. However, alkali solutions containing even small amount of GdnHCl show very large noise signal due to an elevation of the HT voltage; especially, peptide signals are increasingly obscured with GdnHCl content. This difficulty has also been noted in an earlier report

However, 315 K would appear sufficient for substantial unfolding of the MG state (see Figure 5), allowing one to rely on equilibrium thermodynamics for data interpretation. Figure 5(a) and (b) shows 282 nm and 222 nm monitored thermal melts of the B state in the presence of variable salt concentration in the 0.01M­2 M range. The CD amplitude increases with salt increments, indicating increasing fraction of the B state.

transition involves no intermediate, the fit of the data using the standard two-state analysis46 yields m = 0.53( ± 0.05) kcal mol- 1 M- 1 and G° = 1.8( ± 0.8) kcal mol- 1. We now see that the energetic stability of the Na+-stabilized B state is slightly higher than the GdnH+-stabilized IB2 intermediate (see text above and the legend to Figure 3). A comparison with the A-state analysis presented by Hagihara et al.42 indicates that the conformational stability of the NaCl-stabilized A and B states of ferricyt c match fairly well, although the global m-value for the A state is about fourfold higher than that for the latter. Heat and cold denaturation of the B state of cyt c To assess the role of hydrophobic interactions in the stability of the B state, and to determine the qualitative extent of hydration of its apolar surfaces, we recorded a series of CD-monitored temperature denaturation curves for both native and B states of ferricyt c in the presence of variable concentration of NaCl( pH 13). Figure 4 shows some details of data taken at 282 nm and 222 nm for the B state. Figure 4(a) and (b) shows that at - 4 °C the B state (1 M NaCl) retains pretty much native-like CD signals in the aromatic as well as peptide ellipticity bands. 2 À uð T Þ ¼ 6 Á À Á cpre þ mpre T þ cpost þ mpost T exp6 4 2 6 1 þ exp6 4  DHm

where, obs is the observed ellipticity, T is the temperature, mpre and cpre are slope and intercept, respectively, of the pretransition baseline for the 2 M salt curve, and mpost and cpost are slope and intercept of the post-transition baseline in the presence of a given concentration of NaCl. The normalized thermal curves were analyzed by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:  DHm  3 T À 1 þ DCp ½Tm À T þ T lnðT=Tm Þ 7 Tm 7 5 RT ð5Þ

Signal intensity at the same temperature is gradually removed by decreasing salt concentration, exemplified by the spectra observed in the presence of 10 mM NaCl. However, at 80 °C the B state is unfolded irrespective of the salt concentration used (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The variation in the CD intensity at low temperatures is attributed to the cation-dependent content of secondary and tertiary structures. To ascertain that the temperature-induced changes in the CD signal are reversible so that some of the basic principles of equilibrium thermodynamics can be used to interpret the data, the peptide ellipticity of a solution of cyt c at 0.1 M NaCl (pH 13), was continuously recorded while the sample cooled down gradually to 263 K from 295 K (Figure 4(c)). The same values of ellipticity were traced when the sample was heated up from 263 K to 295 K. Similarly, the heat-induced denaturation was checked for reversibility in the 293 K­313 K range (Figure 4(c)). The unfolding was found to be irreversible when heated to temperatures higher than 315 K, perhaps due to aggrega-

where, Hm is the enthalpy at the transition midpoint, Tm, and Cp is the change in heat capacity. Within experimental error, values for Tm, Hm and Cp extracted from the 282 nm and 222 nm CD data were same. Table 1 lists the values obtained from the 222 nm data. The thermal curves exhibit uniform baselines at high temperatures, indicating that the temperature dependence of the ellipticity values of the unfolded protein measured at both 282 nm and 222 nm is independent of NaCl concentration. There are two temperature-dependent unfolding transitions, one at low temperature and the other at high temperature. The low temperature unfolding transition is increasingly noticeable with decreasing salt concentration. Figure 5(c) and (d) magnifies this feature for the 10 mM NaCl data, indicating that the B state of cyt c undergoes cold denaturation. It becomes more obvious at lower salt concentration, because proteins undergo cold denaturation under conditions where the conformation is relatively destabilized by extremes of pH or ionic strength, or both.47

For brevity, we present the Hm versus Tm graph only for those values of Hm that were derived by the third approach (Figure 6). For comparison, data for native cyt c recorded at pH 7 without salt are also presented. Values of Cp calculated from the slopes of all plots are listed in Table 2. The value of Cp for the unfolding of the B state reported here is significantly higher than that in the literature for the thermal unfolding of the A state of cyt c (see Table 2). For the denaturation of the native state though, the Cp value estimated from this work (1.56( ± 0.2) kcal mol- 1 K- 1) is in fair agreement with earlier reported values of 1.26( ± 0.21) kcal mol - 1 K - 1 for horse ferricyt c (Table 2), and 1.37( ± 0.06) kcal mol- 1 K- 1 for yeast iso-1-ferricyt c.51 These comparisons establish the following order for the extent of hydrophobic interactions in different states of cyt c: N > B > A > U.

Discussion
The alkali-denatured state of ferricyt c The base-denatured state, UB, relevant for this study is not the end product (sometimes referred to as state IV) of the commonly known alkaline transition of ferricyt c. Most recent studies indicate that the alkaline transition involves the deprotonation of some unidentified buried groups controlled by unfolding of the -loop foldon.52,53 This local unfolding event results in a swap of the heme ligand (M80  K, pK  9.3) with structural readjustments at the site of the heme.54 Major structural perturbations occur at above pH 12.31,55 The tertiary structure is fully lost at pH 13 (Figure 1(a)), but a fraction of destabilized helical structure is retained. This is the gross structural identity of the UB state,

which has also been likened to an equilibrium intermediate.31 It is well known that pH-denatured states, although largely structureless, do not simulate ideal random coils1,56 and in many cases they are transformed to the molten globule state by the charge screening effect of added ions. A and B states of proteins: charge-stabilized molten globules The A state is well known as a general anionstabilized thermodynamic state of proteins.1­3,20,21 Although the complementary cation-stabilized state under extreme basic conditions has been reported for only a few proteins,22,23,30 the present results for ferricyt c provide growing evidence for the generality of the B state as the cation-stabilized alkali equilibrium state. Since A and B states accumulate under extreme pH conditions, they should be stabilized by the added counter ions through the same mechanism, the solvent ions either reduce the intrapolypeptide electrostatic repulsion or bind directly to the protein charges to form ion pairs, or possibly both.21,28,57 They are also expected to share at least qualitatively similar structural and dynamic properties. Indeed, the B state exhibits all of the basic properties known for the A state of horse ferricyt c.21,24,26 Thus, A and B states are complementary charge-stabilized molten globules. Folding/stabilization of alkali denatured cyt c by GdnHCl We notice that the UB state is transformed to an intermediate, IB2, by GdnH+ (Figure 3(a)). The complementary UA  A transition for ferricyt c is also driven by GdnHCl.42 In both cases, the ions dissociated from GdnHCl influence the stability. The mechanism of interaction of GdnH+ with negative protein charges, and of Cl­ with the positive protein charges need not be the same, however. In acid medium (pH < 2), where the net charges of cyt c is

The Hm values were obtained from fits of thermal data by the use of equation (5): 282 nm CD (), 222 nm CD (). For comparison, variation of Hm with Tm for native ferricyt c at pH 7 is also shown (). Slopes of the lines (Cp) are listed in Table 2.

492 + 24, Cl­ can shield the positive protein charges by Debye-Huckel or ion-pair or both types of interactions. In the basic medium (pH > 12.5), where the net protein charge is -17, GdnH+ ions are more likely to form ion-pairs with the anionic sites of the protein. Formation of Debye-Huckel type spheres will perhaps be unfavorable due to large size of the GdnH+ ions. Crystal structures of proteins with low concentrations of GdnHCl do show direct interaction of GdnH+ ions with proteins.58­60 This argument is advanced only in the context of GdnHCl stabilization of base-denatured cyt c. Na+ ions, far smaller than GdnH+ by radius, may form charge spheres as well. Stabilization of native or native-like states by subdenaturing concentrations of GdnHCl at neutral pH has also been shown for a few proteins.60­63 Although ionic interactions between the ions of GdnHCl and the protein are implicated in all cases, the structural, dynamical, and thermodynamic consequences of protein­denaturant interactions are more involved than the simple charge screening argument.43,44,60 The interactions of the denaturant molecules with different groups of the protein can establish non-specific networks of intramolecular interactions, as observed in crystal structures of proteins with low concentrations of denaturants.59 These cross-linking interactions may serve to decrease the motional freedom in different parts of the protein, but to increase the barriers to motions in the more compact conformers of the protein. Existing X-ray data for proteins do show a significant decrease in the B-factor of side-chain and backbone atoms in the presence of low concentrations of GdnHCl.59 In this scenario, GdnH+-induced stabilization of the alkali- denatured protein (UB  IB2 transition; Figure 3(a)) would appear to originate largely from a reduction in fluctuations in the positions of individual or clusters of atoms around their average. The relative contribution of these two effects, electrostatic shielding and conformational entropy, to the free energy of stabilization of proteins remains to be assessed. Thermal unfolding of the B state Although molten globules in certain cases have not been found to exhibit a cooperative thermal unfolding transition,36,64 data for other proteins, including cytochrome c, apomyoglobin, staphylococcal nuclease, equine lysozyme, and canine milk lysozyme, show cooperative thermal transitions.3 Consistent with the latter observation, the B  UB transitions reported here are rather cooperative; the steepness increases with increase in the NaCl concentration (Figure 5(a) and (b)), reflected clearly by the sizable values of Hm listed in Table 1. Thus, the cation-promoted stability proceeds with an increase in enthalpy. The value of Cp for the B  UB transition reported here is at least 0.4 kcal mol- 1 K- 1 higher than that for the A  UA thermal transition of ferricyt c (Table 2), suggesting that the hydrophobic residues in the B state are relatively

B State of Ferricyt c

more shielded from water. Taking the water accessibility of hydrophobic surfaces as a measure of unfoldedness, the data suggest that the A state of cyt c is more unfolded than the complementary B state. Another interesting observation is a decrease in Sm associated with the B  UB transition regardless of the amount of NaCl added to the medium (Table 1). Since the conformational entropy of the protein in the B state cannot be higher than that in the UB state, the observed entropy suppression must arise from the entropy of water. The change in the water entropy has been suggested to originate from the hydrophobic effect,65 which appears to contribute considerably to the forces stabilizing the B state. This is consistent with the large value of Cp for the B  UB transition. The molten globule state is thought to be stabilized by the same forces that are operative in the native state, i.e. hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions,28 and we do observe the influence of the hydrophobic effect. Cold denaturation of molten globules Although the phenomenon of cold denaturation is firmly based on the thermodynamic principles of protein stability47,48,66,67 perhaps no native protein under normal conditions of pH and pressure has yet been found to undergo cold denaturation without the assistance of destabilizing solvent additives. This is because the native-state stability does not depreciate sufficiently in the experimentally accessible low temperatures. Destabilizing conditions produced by denaturant or extreme pH facilitate observation of cold denaturation.47 Thus, even though cold denaturation of native ferricyt c was predicted many years ago66 experiments have not yet witnessed low-temperature unfolding of this protein at neutral pH. Here we see cold denaturation of the B state (highly basic medium), just as the A state of this same protein (acid medium) has been seen to denature at low temperature.18 Similarly, cold denaturation of the molten globule state of apomyoglobin,19 the low-pH form of holomyoglobin,68 a partially unfolded state of yeast iso1-cytochrome c,69 -lactalbumin,70 and -lactoglobulin71 has been reported. The molecular basis of cold denaturation of proteins is not fully understood. According to one proposal, cold denaturation arises from decreasing hydrophobic contribution to protein stability as the temperature is lowered.72 This is because cold water destabilizes hydrophobic interactions, and the use of solvent additives like alkali and salt, as for the experiments reported here, is unlikely to alter the general mechanism of the process. 48 A recent experimental study of the structure of a colddenatured protein lends support to this view. The cold-denatured state appears to unfold in a noncooperative fashion, as may be thought to arise from a weakening of tertiary, hydrophobic-driven interactions.73 The role of hydrophobic effect in cold-denaturation derived from a two-state model

of water structure has also been proposed.74,75 On the other hand, reports that one can account for Cp of unfolding for many proteins by summing up hydration contributions from individual groups76­79 implies that both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions are responsible for cold denaturation. If so, the relative contributions of the two effects is expected to depend on the content of polar and apolar residues. An analysis oriented toward the determination of the relative contributions of these two effects is beyond the scope of this study, and therefore no definite assessment of the relationship between the large Cp value for the B  UB transition and the hydrophobic effect can be provided. The issue of molecular basis of cold denaturation is deep and more remains to be revealed. Summary and Conclusion To complement the well known A state, there exists a B state of ferricyt c. In extreme basic medium, cations transform the denatured state of ferricyt c (UB) into a charge-stabilized molten globule state (B). The B state meets with the basic molecular and structural organizational definition of the molten globule state. Hydrophobic effect appears to contribute substantially toward the energetic stabilization of the B state, since the thermally driven B  UB transition is characterized by a large heat capacity change. The energetic stability of the B state depreciates with decreasing temperature, and it undergoes cold denaturation.

Materials and Methods
Alkali denaturation in the presence of NaCl Solutions of 0, 0.02, 0.5, and 1.5 M NaCl were prepared in an aqueous medium containing 10 mM each of Tris, disodium hydrogen phosphate, and CAPS (3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid). Each of the NaCl solutions was titrated to different pH values in the pH7­pH13.1 range by the use of minimal volume of NaOH. Cyt c was added to these solutions to obtain samples each containing 9 M protein. The dilutions did not upset the initial salt concentrations greatly. Samples were incubated for  30 min at 22 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra (excitation 280 nm) were taken in a FluoroMax-3 instrument (Jobin-Yvon, Horiba). pH values reported are those measured after the experiments. NaCl titration and GdnHCl unfolding of alkali-denatured cyt c Titrations of cyt c with NaCl in the 0­2.5 M range were carried out at pH 13, 22 °C, and were monitored by both fluorescence and CD. Protein concentrations were 9 M and 20 M for the two probes, respectively. GdnHClinduced equilibrium unfolding of cyt c held at pH 13 was followed by fluorescence alone. CD measurements were not done because signals are obscured in high-pH GdnHCl.
