Abstract The central role of human pancreatic glucokinase in insulin secretion and, consequently, in maintenance of blood glucose levels has prompted investigation into identiWcation of ATP-binding site residues and examination of ATP- and glucose-binding interactions. Because glucokinase has been resistant to crystallization, computer generated homology models were developed based on the X-ray crystal structure of the COOH-terminal domain of human brain hexokinase 1 bound to glucose and ADP or glucose and glucose-6-phosphate. Human pancreatic glucokinase mutants were designed based upon these models and on ATPase domain sequence conservation to identify and characterize potential glucose and ATP-binding sites. SpeciWcally, mutants Asp78Ala, Thr82Ala, Lys90Ala, Lys102Ala, Gly227Ala, Thr228Ala, Ser336Leu, Ser411Ala, and Ser411Leu were constructed, expressed, puriWed, and kinetically characterized under steady-state conditions. Compared to their respective wild type controls, several mutants demonstrated dramatic changes in Vmax, cooperativity of glucose binding and S0.5 for ATP and glucose. Results suggest a role for Asp78, Thr82, Gly227, Thr228, and Ser336 in ATP binding and indicate these residues are essential for glucose phosphorylation by human pancreatic glucokinase.  2005 Elsevier Inc.

Glucokinase, ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.1), is expressed mainly in the insulin-secreting pancreatic -cells and hepatocytes where it catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in glycolysis, namely the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate [1]. In the liver, glucokinase is regulated by glucokinase regulatory protein, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme activity with respect to glucose, which binds to glucokinase at a speciWc binding site [2]. This enzyme is distinguished from other mammalian hexokinases by its lower aYnity

for glucose (Km D 8 mM versus 0.02­0.2 mM for other hexokinases), its smaller molecular size (50 kDa versus 100 kDa), its lack of product inhibition by glucose-6phosphate, and its cooperative/sigmoidal kinetic behavior with respect to glucose [3]. This cooperative behavior contributes to the short-term regulation of glucokinase activity and is unusual in that glucokinase functions as a monomer with a single active site. Several models have been advanced to explain this unexpected cooperativity. It has been postulated that the cooperative behavior of glucokinase arises from glucose causing activation of the enzyme through a `mnemonic mechanism' whereby the enzyme relaxes relatively slowly from the high to low activity state. Therefore, it "remembers" its interaction

with glucose for a time after the release of the products [4]. In contrast, recent competitive inhibition studies in hepatocytes suggest the possible existence of an allosteric glucose-binding site on glucokinase, and this may, in fact, explain the sigmoidal kinetic eVect of glucokinase with respect to glucose [5]. However, studies conducted by Moukil and Van Schaftingen [6], examining the stimulatory eVect of speciWc sugars and glucose analogs on fructose phosphorylation, dispute the presence of this allosteric glucose-binding site. Over 100 diVerent mutations in the glucokinase gene have been linked to a subtype of NIDDM1 called maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 or MODY-2 [7­10]. Recently, the glucokinase mutations in the MODY-2 phenotype were linked not only to kinetic alterations, but also to the regulation of glucokinase activity [10]. Since glucokinase plays a crucial role in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, this has spurred investigation into the identiWcation of glucokinase's binding sites for glucose, ATP, and glucokinase regulatory protein. A model for the 3-D structure of human -cell glucokinase was developed based on the ortho-toluyl glucosamine-bound yeast hexokinase B crystal structure, as these hexokinase species display a 31% sequence identity [11]. By analogy, glucokinase is postulated to fold into two domains, between which the active site resides [11]. Fluorescence studies on glucokinase conWrmed a conformational change was induced upon the binding of glucose [12] and this change is postulated to be essential for catalysis [13]. Based upon this human pancreatic glucokinase model, residues Asn204, Asp205, Asn231, Glu256, and Glu290 have been implicated in glucose binding [14,15]. Because the crystal structure for ATP-bound hexokinase has not yet been solved, mutagenesis and subsequent enzyme characterization were utilized in an attempt to elucidate the glucokinase ATP-binding site. Putative ATP-binding residues were mutated based upon either a common ATPase structural motif [16], strong sequence conservation observed among kinases [17], or a homology model constructed from the coordinates of a glucose and ADP-bound crystal structure of the hexokinase 1 COOH-domain [18] into which ATP was built. WT and mutant forms of human pancreatic -cell gucokinase were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the puriWed proteins were subjected to kinetic analysis.

Materials and methods Materials Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and leupeptin were purchased from Boehringer­Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN) while polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents and restriction enzymes were obtained from Gibco/BRL (Rockville, MD). Sigma Ultra grades of glucose and ATP were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Mono Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin and the HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 High Resolution (26/60) column were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). The Wizard PCR Preps puriWcation kit was from Promega (Madison, WI). Escherichia coli (E. coli) cell strains BHM 71-18 mut S and BL21 (DE3) plysS were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and Novagen (Madison, WI), respectively. All other reagents were obtained in the highest grades available. Site-directed mutagenesis of human -cell glucokinase Construction of the pET3a expression plasmid for human -cell glucokinase has been described previously [19]. This construct, pEhgk-WT, contains the protein coding region along with the 3 -untranslated region of the human -cell glucokinase cDNA clone phGK-20 [20]. Site-directed mutagenesis of the glucokinase gene was performed either using the "QuikChange" system from Stratagene (San Diego, CA) or from substituted oligonucleotides synthesized using the Beckman Oligo 1000M DNA synthesizer and were puriWed using the Beckman DNA UltraFast Cleavage and Deprotection kit (Fullerton, CA). Consecutive PCRs then enabled the mutant oligonucleotides to be extended through their respective restriction sites and, subsequently, subcloned into the human pancreatic glucokinase WT. All mutations were conWrmed by automated DNA sequencing (ABI 374 Sequencer, Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). Expression and puriWcation of WT and mutant human -cell glucokinase WT and mutant glucokinase genes were expressed as native proteins in E. coli essentially as described previously [21]. The pET3a expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells that harbor the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the inducible lacUV5 promoter (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB-medium containing ampicillin (100 g/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 g/ml) to an OD600 nm of approximately 0.6. The cultures were subsequently transferred to 22 °C and expression of the glucokinase gene was induced with 0.4 mM IPTG. After 24 h of induction at 22 °C, the cells were harvested and stored at ¡80 °C, or immediately processed.

WT and mutant forms of glucokinase were puriWed from E. coli extracts essentially as described previously [10,15] with some modiWcations. BrieXy, the cells were lysed on French press and centrifuged to get rid of the debris. The clear cell extract was chromatographed using a Biocad Sprint Perfusion Chromatography System (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) and glucokinase was identiWed by enzymatic activity and SDS­ PAGE analysis. Fractions displaying the highest enzymatic activity were pooled, (NH4)2SO4 precipitated (70%), and gel Wltered on a HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 High Resolution (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) column. An enzyme assay was again used to detect the presence of glucokinase. The proteins were puriWed to homogeneity as determined by SDS­PAGE analysis. Each had a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa. The puriWed proteins were stored at ¡80 °C in 33 mM potassium phosphate buVer (pH 8.0) containing 33 mM KCl, 0.7 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 6 mM glucose, and 33% glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined following trichloroacetic acid precipitation and using bovine serum albumin as the standard as per the method of Lowry et al. [22] or via the Peterson assay [23], which is not aVected by the presence of DTT. Kinetic analysis of WT and mutant glucokinase Glucokinase activity was measured at 30 °C using the spectrophotometric glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled assay. The reaction mixture (1 ml) for kinetic analysis contained 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM NADP+, 0.4 U/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and varied substrate concentrations. The total Mg2+ concentration in each reaction was 1.0 mM in excess of the total ATP concentration. Addition of equimolar stock MgCl2­ATP, previously adjusted to pH 7.5 with 1.0 M NaOH, generated a Wnal pH of 7.5 for the reaction mixture described above. The reactions were initiated with approximately 0.018 U of glucokinase and then followed by measuring the change in A340 using the "Kinetics/Time" program on a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer. One unit of glucokinase activity is deWned as the amount of enzyme necessary to catalyze the formation of 1 mol of product in 1 min at 30 °C under the standard reaction conditions. Initial rates were obtained from a linear regression of the change in A340. The glucose dehydrogenase activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase observed in the absence of glucokinase was measured at each substrate concentration and this velocity was subsequently subtracted from that observed in the presence of glucokinase. For the determination of the kinetic parameters [24], the experiments were performed with either 12 glucose concentrations (100 M­400 mM) and saturating Mg·ATP (i.e., 10£ S0.5 for ATP) or with 8 Mg·ATP

concentrations (50 M­40 mM) and saturating glucose (i.e., 20£ S0.5 for glucose). The range of substrate concentrations used was dependent upon the S0.5 of the enzyme. Velocities were generated from triplicate measurements at each substrate concentration. The Vmax was determined from a least-squares linear regression of the results of a Hanes­Wolf plot with values obtained at high substrate concentrations [24]. Calculation of the Hill coeYcient (nH) and the S0.5 was determined by linear regression of Hill plots. All assays were conducted in triplicate and the values of the kinetic parameters shown represent an average § SEM from at least three independent experiments. All linear regression analyses were done with Sigma Plot [25]. Molecular modeling of the human -cell glucokinase structure The X-ray structure with glucose and ADP bound to human brain hexokinase 1 was used to create a homology model [18]. The high sequence similarity of 54% between human brain hexokinase 1 and human pancreatic glucokinase makes it relatively easy to build the model. Sequence alignment conducted with standard values for GCG [26] pairwise alignment leads to just one gap of two amino acids along the 461 amino acid alignment. Using Insight II and Homology (MSI/Insight, San Diego, CA, USA) the coordinates of 1DGK were used to generate a human pancreatic glucokinase homology model. Bad side chain contacts were identiWed by van der Waals overlap and were repaired by changing the side chain rotamers. This structure was energy minimized using steepest descent within Discover (MSI/ Insight, San Diego, CA, USA). Using the coordinates of the crystal structure ligands (ADP and glucose) as starting positions, the binding positions for the - and -PO4 of ATP were determined based on the need to connect the 6-hydroxyl of glucose close enough to the position of -PO4 to react. Coordinates of ligands ADP, ATP, and glucose-6-phosphate were manipulated using the graphics program O [27]. The hypothesized regulatory glucose-binding site was determined by superimposing the NH2-terminal domain of hexokinase 1, which binds glucose-6-phosphate at the COOH-terminal domain of hexokinase 1 [18]. The crude starting coordinates for regulatory glucose were based on the glucose-6-phosphate coordinates. These manually docked structures were then energy minimized using Discover (MSI/Insight, San Diego, CA, USA). During the Discover runs, all protein residues greater than 4 Å distance from substrate atoms were Wxed. For residues less than 4 Å, the side chain atoms were allowed to move during reWnement while the backbone coordinates were Wxed. In addition, the adenine of ATP and ADP was Wxed. All other atoms were allowed to move. After the structural reWnement, bad contacts were identiWed using the "Bump" routine in

26

InsightII to identify contacts with van der Waals overlap of greater than 0.4 Å. These bad contacts' side chains were then adjusted manually. In the Wnal structure, there were no bad contacts (van der Waals overlap greater than 0.4 Å). The resulting ligand model for ADP binding only diverged in the PO4 atoms from the coordinates of ADP in 1DGK [18]. All the Wgures were generated using Ligplot [28].

Kinetic properties of WT and psWT GK The WT glucokinase had a Vmax of 93.4 mol/min/mg and exhibited cooperative/sigmoidal glucose-dependent kinetics with a Hill coeYcient of 1.6 and the S0.5 was 8.2 mM for glucose (Table 1). The enzyme displayed Michaelis­Menten kinetics with respect to Mg·ATP and had a S0.5 of 0.6 mM Mg·ATP. These values are very similar to those previously reported [3,14,15,24]. The glucokinase expression plasmid used in previous studies [14,15,19,31,32], and a portion of the present study, codes for an Asp158Ala mutation (Table 2). This mutation is also present in the original cDNA produced by Nishi et al. [20] and is denoted pseudo-wild type (psWT). It is presumed that this mutation is an artifact that arose during cloning and is not a polymorphism [32]. As shown previously [32] and here in Table 2 for comparison, the psWT glucokinase exhibits a Vmax (95.4 mol/min/mg) similar to that of WT glucokinase as well as normal ATP-dependent kinetics with a S0.5 of 0.5 mM for ATP. The enzyme also displayed the characteristic cooperative kinetics for glucose with an nH value of 1.5. However, the Asp158Ala mutation causes an approximately 2-fold decrease in the S0.5 for glucose (Table 2). In the present study, this psWT mutation was reverted to WT by site-directed mutagenesis in glucokinase mutants Thr82Ala, Thr228Ala, Ser336Leu, Ser411Ala, and Ser411Leu (Table 1). These mutants were chosen on the basis of the new model that predicted the role of the corresponding residues in ATP binding. However, the mutant glucokinase proteins analyzed and presented in Table 2 (Asp78Ala, Lys90Ala, Lys102Ala, Gly227Ala, and Thr228Ala) carry this mutation and thus, comparisons are made between psWT glucokinase mutants and psWT glucokinase. The question of the eVect of the Asp158Ala mutation on three glucokinase mutants, Gly80Ala, Thr168Pro, and Ala53Ser was investigated earlier [10]. In the present study, the Thr228Ala mutation is designed with both WT and psWT backgrounds, for comparative purposes. The presence of the Asp158 mutation had little eVect on mutations studied here or previously [10]. Mg·ATP-binding site The Asp78Ala mutation in glucokinase abolishes enzymatic activity and cooperativity while slightly changing the S0.5 values for ATP and glucose (Table 2). These results are similar to earlier observations regarding various mutant forms of Asp532 human brain hexokinase 1 (which corresponds to residue Asp78 of glucokinase) [33]. Asp78 of glucokinase is speculated to be a critical residue in enzyme catalysis. The corresponding Asp residue is conserved within phosphortransferases in heat shock protein [34], glycerol kinase [35], and

Results and discussion Comparison of previous models with the human pancreatic glucokinase model Human pancreatic glucokinase shares 54 and 51% sequence identity with the catalytic COOH-domain and regulatory NH2-terminal domain of human brain hexokinase 1, respectively, with only one or two gaps, compared to 31% identity with yeast hexokinase, which required 10 gaps for alignment. Consequently, the human pancreatic glucokinase homology model constructed from the COOH-terminal domain of human brain hexokinase 1 is expected to provide a more accurate model of glucokinase for selecting the correct amino acid residues located in the ATP-binding site. Hexokinase is a paradigm for induced-Wt catalysis, with the small domain rotating about 14° relative to the large domain upon binding glucose. This rotation results in the formation of an ATP-binding cleft between the small and large domain that is essential for the initiation of enzyme catalysis [13,18,29]. Based on this analogy, glucokinase is predicted to fold into two domains separated by a deep active site cleft with glucose binding at the bottom of the cleft while Mg·ATP sits on the top of this closed cleft interacting with both the domains [10,11,15,30]. Many of the residues implicated in Mg·ATP binding in previous phosphortransferase models [11,16,30] were also involved in Mg·ATP binding in our model (Fig. 1). Glucokinase molecular models Fig. 1 shows the molecules of ADP and glucose-6phosphate in a homology model of human pancreatic glucokinase based on the crystal structure of the COOHdomain of hexokinase 1 [18]. This homology model suggests that the highly conserved Thr82, Ser336, and Ser411 residues function in ATP binding and therefore were selected for mutagenesis. (Alternatively, residues Asp78, Gly227, and Thr228 were chosen for mutagenesis based upon a common ATPase motif [16] while residues Lys90 and Lys102 were selected for study due to strong sequence conservation among kinases [17].) Fig. 2 depicts a homology model of human pancreatic glucokinase to which molecules of ATP, glucose, and regulatory glucose are bound.

brain hexokinase 1 [33,36] having the presumed function of binding Mg2+ ion. Thus, Asp78 of human glucokinase is predicted to interact with Mg2+ complexed to ATP during glucose phosphorylation [16]. In the model, Asp78 OD1 is 7.12 Å from ATP O1B while Asp78 OD2 is 6.91 Å from ATP O3G and is about 5 Å from Mg2+. As these three distances are too far apart for direct hydrogen bonding, an Asp78 association with Mg2+ would require a mediating water molecule (Fig. 1) as found in the crystal structure of human brain hexokinase 1 [18]. Mg2+ is coordinated by O1B and O2B of -phosphoryl and O3G of the -phosphoryl group of ATP, the O6 hydroxyl of glucose, and OD2 of Asp78 mediated through a water molecule. The chelation of Mg2+ by O1B and O3G of ATP is similar to that found in the

ATP-binding domain of actin for Ca2+ to ATP with linking distance within 0.1 Å. This diVers from the glucokinase model presented earlier [30] where Mg2+ is directly chelated by Asp78 (OD1 and OD2), Asp205 (OD1), Ser151 (OG), and ATP (OG1, OG2, and OG3). However, their homology model is based on the coordinates of hexokinase 1 in complex with glucose and glucose-6-phosphate. These starting coordinates have two limitations relative to the ADP and glucose bound to glucokinase. First, the coordinates are of a catalytically inactive form of human brain hexokinase 1. Second, these coordinates do not contain binding sites of adenosine, ribose, and any of the phosphates of ATP. The Thr82Ala mutant exhibits pronounced eVects on glucokinase activity similar to those reported earlier for

the Gly80Ala mutant [10], including a severely impaired Vmax reduced to less than 3% of that observed for WT glucokinase, a 4-fold increase in S0.5 for Mg·ATP, and a complete loss of glucose cooperativity. Additionally, Thr82Ala displays a 6-fold decrease in S0.5 for glucose. According to the model, Thr82Ala causes loss of a hydrogen bond to O1A oxygen (2.97 Å) of ATP (Fig. 2).

Being in close proximity to Gly80, the Thr82 residue is predicted to be part of the -turn structure of the ATPbinding hairpin. The Gly80Ala mutation adds a CB atom that will come within 3 Å of O1B of ATP. The Lys90Ala and Lys102Ala mutants demonstrate similar kinetic properties to that of psWT glucokinase, although the Vmax is nearly doubled for Lys90Ala, the

a Pseudo-wild type (psWT) contains the Asp158Ala mutation. Human pancreatic glucokinase mutants were generated from pseudo-wild type glucokinase, as indicated in parentheses by psWT. Residues were substituted with alanines to maximize their potential kinetic impact.

glucose S0.5 for Lys90Ala and Lys102Ala is elevated approximately 2- and 5-fold, respectively. The Lys90 residue is speculated to reside on the protein surface, far from the active site and presumably does not contribute to any side chain interactions. Possibly the observed enhanced enzymatic activity and small increase in S0.5 for glucose when compared to psWT glucokinase result from a conformational change at the active site induced upon mutagenesis. Similarly, Lys102 is postulated to reside far from the active site. The decreased aYnity for glucose induced by the Lys102Ala mutation may be explained by the observation that the alanine mutation eliminates interactions with Glu93 and Ser100 in the closed conformation. In the model, Asp158 is located 15.33 Å from the closest atom of glucose O3. The Asp158Ala mutation, although purportedly removed from the active site, displays a reduced S0.5 for glucose, and is speculated to eliminate an interaction with Gln465 in the closed conformation. Due to their presumed substantial distances from the ATP-binding site, these three highly conserved residues [32,37] show no change in ATP S0.5 values upon mutagenesis. The Gly227 residue primarily aVects ATP aYnity, supporting the prediction that this region is important for ATP binding to the adjacent -turn structure. The Gly227Ala mutation reduces the Vmax about 2-fold and increases the S0.5 for glucose and ATP by 2- and 3-fold, respectively, when compared to psWT glucokinase. This alanine substitution is postulated to drive the and phosphates of ATP away from the binding site. This mutant also displays a small decrease in glucose cooperativity. Similar results were observed for Val226Met, a residue implicated in ATP binding [10]. Thr228 is speculated to be a critical-binding site residue whose hydroxyl side chain and amide group are predicted to form hydrogen bonds to the -phosphoryl group of ATP, and thus may be important for the catalytic reaction of glucokinase [1]. According to the model, the Thr228Ala mutation causes a loss of hydrogen bonds to the O2A oxygen of ATP (Fig. 2). The dramatic reductions of Vmax and of the aYnity for ATP upon mutagenesis support this contention. These kinetic eVects are consistent with those observed for mutants of Thr680, the analogous residue

in human hexokinase 1 [33,38]. Additionally, the Thr228Ala mutant abolished native glucokinase cooperativity. The mutant Ser336Leu displays an enzymatic activity reduced to 1% of WT glucokinase, the largest increase in S0.5 for ATP observed (26-fold), a moderate decrease in S0.5 values for glucose, and abolished glucose cooperativity. Ser336 OG forms a hydrogen bond to N1 of the adenine ring (Fig. 1). In addition to the elimination of a hydrogen bond to adenine, mutation of Ser336 to Leu could lead to steric interference with adenine (CD1 and CD2 are all closer to the adenine ring), placing CB within 2 Å of N1 and CD1 within 2 Å of N1 and 2.1 Å of C6. The other common rotamer for leucine could lead to several conXicts with the protein itself. The reduction in Vmax could be due to -phosphoryl binding in a sub-optimal way greatly reducing stabilization of the transition state [16,33,39]. Clearly, this mutation disrupted the glucose­ATP interaction and greatly aVected the ATPbinding site, which is consistent with earlier reports on MODY-2 mutations [30]. These eVects are consistent with the predicted location of Ser336 near the adenine ring of the ADP/ATP-binding site distantly located from the glucose-binding site in the model (Figs. 1 and 2). The Ser411Ala and Ser411Leu mutants exhibit a 6and 45-fold reduction in enzymatic activity, respectively. However, their glucose and ATP S0.5 values were only marginally reduced as compared to WT glucokinase. The nH values for these mutants were similar to the Hill coeYcients of WTGK. The Ser411 OG is predicted to hydrogen bond to O5* of the ATP/ADP (Figs. 1 and 2). Ser411 N is also predicted to hydrogen bond to O5*, and Ser411 CB is in van der Waals contact with both C4* and C5* of ATP/ADP. The Ser411Ala mutation removes hydrogen bonding that tethers a portion of polyphosphate. Since the side chain of Ser411 does not point directly into the ATP-binding pocket, the additional atoms of a leucine side chain will not reduce the size of the ATP-binding crevice. However, it may close oV from above the "phosphate channel" restricting the conformations of ATP capable of binding to glucokinase. Although the side chain of leucine contains three additional methyl/methylene groups compared to

alanine, the kinetic parameters do not proportionally reXect the steric eVect produced by the introduction of these three groups. This may be explained by the fact that, since the side chain at 411 is almost parallel to the ATP-binding site, only one methyl atom of Leu411 will interact with ATP. As shown in Fig. 2, the resultant hydrogen bond loss is not enough to disturb the ATPbinding site. However, the lowered S0.5 value for glucose of the Ser411 mutant might be due to its location at the COOH-domain end. Lys414 is located in close proximity to Ser411 at the COOH-domain end and similarly demonstrated a reduced S0.5 for glucose [32] upon mutagenesis. Although the results presented in this study show similar trends to the earlier reports based on the same set of data of a large number of MODY-2 mutants [9,30,40], the magnitude of Km values for ATP in MODY-2 Ser336Leu was much higher than we report. This discrepancy in the kinetic data for MODY-2 Ser336Leu is due to the fact that Km values for WT glucokinase were under-estimated by approximately half as compared with the ATP S0.5 values obtained in this study. The reason for variable ATP aYnities might be due to the determination of apparent Km values for ATP at one times (1£) the S0.5 of glucose in the previous report [40] compared to the more precise S0.5 values obtained under the saturated glucose condition of 10£ S0.5 used in the present study. Glucose cooperativity We have generated a model for human pancreatic glucokinase based upon the crystal structure of the COOH-terminal domain of hexokinase 1 and on our kinetic data. The model we propose includes a regulatory glucose-binding site which presumably accounts for the enzyme's cooperativity. Our model supports the mechanism for glucose cooperativity postulated by Kamata et al. [41], in which glucokinase can exist in either a super-open, open or closed form, depending on the availability of substrate. In the absence of glucose, glucokinase exists primarily in the super-open form. Kamata et al. [41], speculate that it is the binding of glucose to the glucose-binding site which slowly converts the super-open form to the open form. However, we propose that, at low glucose concentrations, it is the binding of glucose to the regulatory glucose-binding site which induces a slow transition to the open form. According to our model, the binding of ATP and a second molecule of glucose then induces a rapid conformational change from the open to the closed form. The model proposed by Kamata et al. [41], only requires the presence of ATP to induce a rapid transition from the open to closed conformation. Both models predict, following the reaction, glucokinase reverts to its open form to release products. According to both models, the ratio of the fast and slow

cycles is responsible for the cooperativity exhibited by glucokinase. The kinetic model of glucokinase activity in which the enzyme exists in three conformations with two catalytic cycles is consistent with the mnemonical mechanism postulated by Storer and Cornish-Bowden [4]. The discrepancy over the existence of the regulatory glucose-binding site may be explained by the diVerent approaches used to generate each model. Kamata et al. [41], developed their model based upon the crystal structures of truncated human hepatic glucokinase either unbound or bound to glucose and a synthetic activator. They observed that glucokinase undergoes a much larger conformational change than hexokinase 1 during the catalytic cycle and, consequently, speculated glucokinase may exist in three conformations [41]. Our model is based on the crystal structure of the COOH-domain of hexokinase 1 bound to endogenous ligands and on our kinetic data. We speculate glucokinase can exist in three conformations and that the regulatory glucose-binding site is crucial to the enzyme's activity. Our supposition that glucokinase may, in fact, have two glucose-binding sites is substantiated by several studies. The observation that glucokinase can bind two moles of the aYnity label N-(N-bromoacetyl)-6-aminohexanoyl glucosamine suggests that glucokinase may contain two glucose-binding sites [42]. More recently, the observation that glucose analogues not signiWcantly phosphorylated can cause translocation of glucokinase, along with the Wnding that mannoheptulose eVects glucokinase cooperativity in a manner consistent with a model in which mannoheptulose interacts predominantly with an allosteric glucosebinding site, suggests the presence of two glucose-binding sites on glucokinase [5]. This would be consistent with the results of the crystal structure of human brain hexokinase 1 simultaneously complexed to glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP, which suggests both a catalytic site and additional adjacent hexose-6-phosphate sensitivity site [18,43]. Fig. 2 depicts our human pancreatic glucokinase model containing two glucose-binding sites. Shown are the predicted interactions with substrates glucose, ATP, and Mg2+ at the catalytic site. Here, the hypothesized secondary glucose site is occupied by regulatory glucose replacing the water molecule in Fig. 1. Our results suggest that residues Thr82, Gly227, Thr228, and Ser336, which demonstrated the most diminished Vmax values and the most elevated S0.5 values for ATP, are directly involved in ATP binding. Furthermore, our data suggest residue Asp78 interacts indirectly with ATP via a mediating water molecule and Mg2+ ion. Based upon the COOH-terminal domain of human brain hexokinase 1 and our kinetic data, a homology model for human pancreatic glucokinase was generated which includes a regulatory glucose-binding site, believed essential for cooperativity. Because glucokinase plays a fundamental role as glucose sensor in the

pancreatic -cells, the identiWcation of pharmacological activators for regulating its enzymatic activity in diabetic conditions will likely expedite the development of new therapeutic strategies for the control of excessive hepatic glucose production.
