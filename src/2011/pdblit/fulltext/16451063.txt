Recently, we disclosed a new class of HCV polymerase inhibitors discovered through high-throughput screening (HTS) of the GlaxoSmithKline proprietary compound collection. This interesting class of 3-(1,1dioxo-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)-4-hydroxy-2(1H)-quinolinones potently inhibits HCV polymerase enzymatic activity and inhibits the ability of the subgenomic HCV replicon to replicate in Huh-7 cells. This report will focus on the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of substituents on the quinolinone ring, culminating in the discovery of 1-(2-cyclopropylethyl)-3-(1,1-dioxo-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)-6-fluoro4-hydroxy-2(1H)-quinolinone (130), an inhibitor with excellent potency in biochemical and cellular assays possessing attractive molecular properties for advancement as a clinical candidate. The potential for development and safety assessment profile of compound 130 will also be discussed.
Introduction Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was first characterized in 1989 as the major cause of non-A and non-B hepatitis infections.1 Despite the routine screening of blood transfusion supplies since 1992, the number of new hepatitis C infections in 2001 was estimated at 25,000-35,000 cases in the United States. According to WHO figures, greater than 2% of the world population is chronically infected with HCV. The majority (approximately 80%) of these infections will develop into chronic hepatitis and a significant percentage (approximately 20%) will progress to cirrhosis, with many advancing to hepatocellular carcinoma.2,3 The heterogeneity of the hepatitis C virus has hampered the development of a vaccine, and thus far, there is no universally effective therapy for all HCV genotypes. The standard of care for HCV infection is combination treatment using pegylated interferon-R and ribavirin, a nonspecific, antiviral nucleoside analogue. The rate of success obtained with this treatment is highly dependent upon the HCV genotype with which patients are infected, with a greater rate [70-80% sustained viral response (SVR) after 24 weeks of treatment] observed for those affected with genotypes 2 and 3. However for genotype 1, which accounts for approximately 70% of all HCV infections worldwide, the SVR is around 40-45% after 48 weeks of therapy.4 In addition, the typical side effects associated with the use of interferons, which include headaches, nausea, fatigue, and other neuropsychological disorders, make patient compliance difficult, especially considering that people affected by the virus often proceed asymptomatically for several decades.

HCV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the FlaViViridae family. Its 9,600 nucleotide genome encodes for a single polyprotein of approximately 3,000 amino acids, which is processed by host cell and viral proteases into three structural proteins (C, E1 and E2) and six nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B).4 Much research has been devoted to the discovery of inhibitors of NS3,5 both protease and helicase components, and more recently, of NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and several classes of potent inhibitors have now been described.6,7 The HCV polymerase is essential for viral replication and growth,8,9 it has been structurally characterized,10-12 and there are no known mammalian RdRps. Thus, it represents an excellent target for the development of anti-HCV agents. High-Throughput Screening. In search of novel HCV polymerase inhibitors, a robust RdRp scintillation-proximity assay (SPA) using N-terminal-truncated 21-NS5B was developed as described previously.13 HTS of the GlaxoSmithKline proprietary compound collection resulted in the identification of 1-butyl-3-(1,1-dioxo-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)-4-hydroxy-2(1H)-quinolinone (1) as a potent HCV polymerase inhibitor. The biochemical characterization of this 4-hydroxy2(1H)-quinolinone was previously described,13 wherein it was shown that compound 1 did not interact with nucleic acid, it was noncompetitive with respect to GTP, and it reduced subgenomic viral-RNA replication in an Huh-7 cell-based HCV replicon system. In the same report, we also disclosed compound 2, a more potent polymerase inhibitor. In this report we will

detail the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the quinoline portion of compound 1 and how modifications of this screening hit led to the discovery of an inhibitor of viral replication with potency in the low nanomolar range. Chemistry. The synthesis of 1-alkyl-3-(1,1-dioxo-2H-1,2,4benzothiadiazin-3-yl)-4-hydroxy-2(1H)-quinolinones (I) was first reported by Ukrainets et al.14 via the thermal condensation of ethyl 1-alkyl-4-hydroxy-2-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylates 3 with 2-aminobenzenesulfonamide 4, followed by base-catalyzed heterocyclization (Scheme 1). For the synthesis of compounds 1, 2, 10-111, 129, and 130, a more robust methodology was developed via the base-catalyzed condensation of an appropriately substituted 1-alkyl-2H-3,1-benzoxazine-2,4(1H)dione 7 and ethyl (1,1-dioxo-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)acetate 9 (Scheme 2).15 Ester 9 was obtained by reaction of 2-aminobenzensulfonamide 4 with ethyl malonyl chloride, followed by base-catalyzed cyclization, as previously described by Ukrainets et al.16 In the absence of a commercial source of the required substituted isatoic anhydrides 6, the latter were prepared from the corresponding anthranilic acids 5, using phosgene or a phosgene equivalent. The N-1-substituent was installed by the reaction of 6 with an alkyl halide in the presence of sodium hydride or with the appropriate alcohol under Mitsunobu conditions.17 Alternatively, in some cases the Nsubstituted 2H-3,1-benzoxazine-2,4(1H)-dione 7 was obtained by first coupling the 2-bromobenzoic acid 8 with the requisite alkylamine in the presence of Cu(II), followed by heterocyclization with phosgene (Scheme 2). Finally, elaboration of the 6-amino derivative 85 and 6-hydroxy derivative 86 via alkylation or acylation afforded compounds 90-102 (not illustrated). To probe the structural requirements for inhibition by the heterocyclic 3-(1,1-dioxo-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)-4-hyScheme 2a,b

droxy-2(1H)-quinolinone template, a series of modified analogues (Figure 1) was prepared through a variety of synthetic approaches. Thus, the 4-deshydroxy analogue 115 was prepared (Scheme 3) from 2-chloroquinoline (112) via acyl chloride 114, which was coupled with 2-aminobenzenesulfonamide 4, followed by cyclization. The synthesis of the 2-desoxy compound 119 was accomplished starting from aniline (116), as shown in Scheme 4. Reductive amination with isovaleraldehyde, followed by condensation with diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate and then PPAmediated cyclization afforded intermediate ester 117. Conversion of 117 to acyl chloride 118, followed by coupling with 2-aminobenzenesulfonamide 4 and cyclization, gave the desired product. Thermal condensation of carbamate 12118 (Scheme 5) with the substituted isatoic anhydride 7 provided quinazolinedione 122, in which the C-3 of inhibitor 2 was replaced by nitrogen.19 The 4-N-methylbenzothiadiazine derivative 125 was synthesized from N-methylaniline (123, Scheme 6) by treatment with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate followed by acidic hydrolysis and then amide formation with ethyl malonyl chloride. Subsequent heterocyclization afforded ester 124, which was condensed with 1-(3-methylbutyl)-2H-3,1-benzoxazine-2,4(1H)-dione to give

of radioactivity at varying inhibitor concentrations generated inhibition curves.13 The ability of NS5B to polymerize GTP under these assay conditions proves to be very sensitive to the nature of the quinoline N-1 substituent of the 3-(1,1-dioxo-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)-4-hydroxy-2-(1H)-quinolinones (Table 1). Compounds containing no substitution or only a short alkyl chain (1-3 carbon atoms, Table 1, compounds 10-13) are weak inhibitors of NS5B. However, increasing the length of the linear alkyl chain to four or five carbon atoms results in a significant increase in inhibitory potency (Table 1, compounds 1 and 16). Most promisingly, incorporation of a branched alkyl chain containing between five and six carbons results in a further increase in activity, as observed when comparing n-butyl analogue 1 (IC50 ) 200 nM) with 3-methylbutyl analogue 2 (IC50 ) 32 nM) and 3,3-dimethylbutyl compound 15 (IC50 ) 21 nM). Incorporation of unsaturation into the N-1 chain provides several alkenes and alkynes (compounds 18-23), which are generally weaker inhibitors of NS5B, whereas cycloalkyl-substituted variants are fairly well tolerated. In particular, within the homologous series of C3 to C6 cycloalkylmethyl derivatives (compounds 24 and 27-29), the cyclobutylmethyl derivative 27 is the most potent (IC50 ) 49 nM), with activity dropping off as the ring size increases. Further branching by substitution on the cyclopropyl ring of compound 24 (IC50 ) 78 nM) with a methyl group (compound 25, mixture of isomers) results in a modest 2-fold increase in potency. However, an even greater increase in potency (6-fold) is seen

Results and Discussion Inhibition of HCV NS5B Polymerase Activity. The primary testing of compounds was performed using a scintillation proximity assay to measure the incorporation of radio-labeled 33P-GTP into a biotinylated oligo-G 13 primer in the presence of a poly-C template catalyzed by 10 nM of HCV NS5B (genotype 1b, J4 strain, 21 construct).

upon homologation to the cyclopropylethyl derivative 26 (IC50 ) 13 nM), which is among the most active compounds within this series. Substitution of the N-1 alkyl substituent with halogens or polar functionality generally proves to be deleterious to the inhibitory activity of the 3-(1,1-dioxo-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazin3-yl)-4-hydroxy-2(1H)-quinolinones, even with simple isosteric modifications (Table 2, compounds 30-53). Relative to n-butyl analogue 1, the 1-methoxyethyl derivative 35 is much less active, while the more lipophilic (methylthio)ethyl compound 39 is slightly more potent. Similarly, incorporation of a basic nitrogen into the side chain of i-amyl derivative 2 (IC50 ) 32 nM) provides 1-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl derivative 45, a compound devoid of activity. Interestingly, while the activity of methoxyethyl compound 35 is reduced 4-fold relative to the n-butyl analogue 1, branched methoxypropyl compound 36 (IC50 ) 82 nM) is nearly equipotent to its isosteric all-carbon analogue 17 (IC50 ) 65 nM). Replacement of protons by fluorine atoms is tolerated; for example, compounds 30 and 31 have similar activities to their parent, nonfluorinated alkyl derivatives. Interestingly, addition of a relatively large bromine atom near the terminus of the butyl chain (compound 32) results in an inhibitor of equivalent potency to the unsubstituted butyl compound 1. Cyanopropyl derivative 33 (IC50 ) 172 nM) is equipotent with its isosteric alkyne 23 (IC50 ) 179 nM); however, the slightly larger, homologated cyanobutyl compound 34 is somewhat less potent (IC50 ) 750 nM). The two isomeric (tetrahydrofuranyl)methyl derivatives 37 and 38 are less active than the corresponding cyclopentane derivative 28. As previ-

ously alluded, incorporation of polar functionality, such as in the homologous series of hydroxylalkyl analogues (compounds 42-44) or aminoalkyl derivative 47, is poorly tolerated. Therefore, despite the presence of amino acid side chains containing potential hydrogen-bonding functionality in the N-1 binding pocket (vide infra), all attempts to increase potency by engaging hydrophilic interactions with such residues or the peptide backbone amide functionality have been unfruitful to date. Aromatic and heteroaromatic substituents at N-1 are generally tolerated, provided that they are separated from the heterocyclic template by a one-carbon atom spacer (Table 3). For example, while the N-phenyl (54), N-phenethyl (56), and the N-phenylpropyl (57) compounds are essentially inactive at the concentrations tested, the N-benzyl compound 55 displays excellent inhibitory activity. In general, m-substituted benzyl derivatives are more effective inhibitors than the corresponding p- and o-derivatives. An approximate 30-fold increase in activity is observed when a nitro group is moved from the 4-position on an N-1 benzyl substituent (compound 61, IC50 ) 2442 nM) to the 3-position (compound 60, IC50 ) 81 nM). The 4-bromobenzyl derivative 63 (IC50 ) 95 nM) is about 2.5-fold less active than 3-bromobenzyl derivative 64 (IC50 ) 36 nM), and overall, bromo substitution is better tolerated than nitro substitution. Although a relatively weak inhibitor, the 2-cyanobenzyl derivative 58 (IC50 ) 780 nM) is considerably more active than the 2-nitrobenzyl derivative 59 (IC50 >10,000 nM). Among the isomeric series of (pyridinyl)methyl analogues (compounds 6567), the pyridine-4-yl compound 67 is the most active (IC50 ) 61 nM). The smaller 3-(furanyl)methyl substituent (derivative 68) also appears to be well-accommodated in the N-1 binding pocket (IC50 ) 27 nM). As in the case of the N-phenethyl derivative 56, the two isomeric (thienyl)ethyl derivatives 69 and 70 are poor inhibitors of NS5B activity.

The structure-activity relationships for varying the substituents on the quinolinone ring are also in good agreement with those predicted by analysis of an inhibitor-bound crystal structure (vide infra), wherein the tight fit of the quinolinone portion of the molecule into the binding pocket allows for substitution to be tolerated only at positions C-5 and C-6 (Figure 2b). Small- to medium-sized groups are tolerated at C-5, although little improvement in NS5B inhibition is observed with these derivatives (compounds 72-78, Table 4). A wider range of substituents is tolerated at C-6, with most of the C-6 derivatized compounds demonstrating potent NS5B inhibitory activity (Table 5). Short linear chains bearing polar substituents are particularly active (i.e., entries 91, 94, 95, and 97, IC50 ) 34, 24, 21, and 48 nM, respectively). Smaller groups (polar or nonpolar) are also quite potent. In addition to their outstanding enzymatic activities, the 6-fluoro (79, IC50 ) 20 nM), 6-methyl (83, IC50 ) 47 nM), and 6-amino (85, IC50 ) 62 nM) analogues are also among the most active compounds with respect to their ability to inhibit cellular replication of subgenomic HCV RNA in Huh-7 cells (vide infra). 6-Amido substituents are poorly tolerated, as can be seen from the relatively poor activity of N-acyl analogues (98-102) when compared with the N-alkylsubstituted compounds 95-97.

Substitution at C-7 is very poorly tolerated, as illustrated by the small set of analogues in Table 6 (compounds 103-109). With the exception of fluorine derivative 103 (IC50 ) 554 nM), all the other derivatives have an IC50 > 10,000 nM. Due to unfavorable steric interactions between C-8 and N-1, substitution at the C-8 position proved to be synthetically challenging; however, the two synthetically accessible derivatives 110 and 111 do not show any improvement in activity (Table 7). Speculation over the importance of the hydrogen-bonding atoms in the pyridinone and thiadiazinedioxide portions of these heterocyclic inhibitors led to the investigation of a series of derivatives aimed at probing these interactions (Figure 1). Removal of either the 4-hydroxy group (compound 115) or 2-oxo atom (compound 119) or replacement of the 4-hydroxy group with a 4-amino group (compound 126) affords compounds with very little inhibitory activity at the concentrations tested (IC50s > 10,000 nM). Changing the 4-hydroxyquinolin-2-one heterocycle to a quinazolin-2,3-dione (compound 122), which replaces the quinoline C-3 with nitrogen in order to lock the C-4 functionality into the keto tautomer, also affords a derivative with lower potency against NS5B (IC50 ) 9,940 nM). Modification of the benzothiadiazine portion of the molecule, including excision of the sulfone completely to give a benzimidazole 127 or replacement with a carbonyl group to give a quinazolinone 128, also results in poorly active NS5B inhibitors. Similarly, analogue 125, possessing a methyl substitution on the benzothiadiazine 4-nitrogen atom, is approximately 75-fold less active (IC50 ) 2,430 nM) than parent compound 2 (IC50 ) 32 nM). It is therefore apparent that each of these transformations remove or change some critical binding element with the NS5B enzyme binding pocket, either by losing the capacity to bind to

Inhibition of Subgenomic Replication in Huh-7 Cells. Since no direct antiviral cell culture system for HCV has been developed to date,20 the ability of 3-(1,1-dioxo-2H-1,2,4benzothiadiazin-3-yl)-4-hydroxy-2(1H)-quinolinones to inhibit HCV RNA replication intracellularly was evaluated in the subgenomic replicon system.13 In this assay, carried out in Huh-7 cells, several compounds show low micromolar to low nanomolar inhibition of viral RNA replication. In general, biochemical potency correlates well with activity in the replicon assay, provided poor cell membrane permeability and/or decreased solubility under the assay conditions does not preclude the determination of an accurate cellular EC50. A list of selected compounds and their cellular EC50s and EC90s is shown in Table 8. Comparing EC50 values, the 1-(3methyl)butyl analogue 2 and the 1-butyl derivative 1 possess very similar levels of inhibitory activity in the replicon assay, despite the 6-fold difference in their enzyme inhibition. The 1-(2-cyclopropyl)ethyl analogue 26 is approximately 3-fold more active than compounds 1 and 2 in the Replicon system. A small increase in potency of less than 2-fold over compounds 1 and 2 was observed with 1-(cyclobutyl)methyl substitution (Table 8; compound 27). Substitution at the N-1 position with (aryl)methyl groups (compounds 54 and 68) was not as advantageous, resulting in poor inhibitors of cellular replication. The 5-fluoro substituted analogue 72 possesses cellular activity similar to that

of the unsubstituted parent compound 2, while addition of small substituents at the C-6 position generally results in equivalent or modestly improved potency in the Replicon assay; 6-fluoro (compound 79), 6-methyl (compound 83), and 6-amino (compound 85) substitutions all demonstrate improved activity over unsubstituted compound 2. Interestingly, substitution at the C-6 position with a variety of polar functionalities provides a series of generally potent cellular inhibitors, seemingly irrespective of the functionality present (compounds 91, 94, 95, and 97). The relatively poor correlation between enzyme inhibition and inhibition of cellular replication for such analogues could potentially be attributed to the relative abilities of the inhibitors to penetrate the cellular membrane of Huh-7 cells. For example, carboxylic acid 95 shows excellent levels of enzyme inhibition but an unexpectedly poor cellular effect (NS5B IC50 ) 21 nM, cellular EC50 ) 2,492 nM). This result is in contrast with that for the corresponding ethyl ester (compound 96), which shows a more robust inhibition of cellular replication despite possessing a decreased ability to inhibit enzymatic activity (NS5B IC50 ) 115 nM, cellular EC50 ) 265 nM). It is most important to ascertain whether the improved potency effects of independently optimized substituents are additive or synergistic when incorporated into the same inhibitor. Indeed, for the series of 3-(1,1dioxo-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)-4-hydroxy-2(1H)-quinolinones under investigation, this is the case, as can be seen from Table 8; compound 129 and, more remarkably, compound 130, in which the combination of a preferred C-6 substituent (fluoro) with the N-1 (2-cyclopropyl)ethyl moiety results in an inhibitor

In general, these inhibitors fit tightly into a single, high occupancy site in the palm/thumb domain interface.10 A close up of the NS5B/compound 2 complex is shown in Figure 2a,b, from which it can be appreciated how, due to the tight fit, only certain positions on the inhibitor are open for further substitution. Specifically, the C-5 and C-6 positions of the quinolinone ring, consistent with the observed SAR (vide supra), along with the C-7 and C-8 positions of the benzothiadiazine ring (the full

exploration of these latter positions will be described in a future publication) are amenable to substitution. This inhibitor binding site is outlined by residues from the palm, finger, and thumb domains and resides in a region distinct from other reported non-nucleoside allosteric inhibitors that bind mainly in the thumb domain.7 Also shown in Figure 2a are some highly conserved, tightly bound water molecules, mediating the hydrogen-bond interactions of the inhibitor with the protein, consistently present in all the structures determined. Another key feature observed in all of the structures determined is an apparent edge-to-face -interaction between Phe193 and the benzo portion of the benzothiadiazine ring system. Although a small molecule X-ray crystal structure of compound 2 had shown coplanarity between the quinolone and benzothiadiazine rings (data not shown), due primarily to internal hydrogen bonds, experimental electron density indicates that the inhibitor molecule is distorted away from planarity when bound to NS5B. Activity against Other HCV Genotypes and Other Polymerases. Hepatitis C virus is a rapidly mutating virus and has been classified into six major genotypes (1-6) with numerous subtypes. Testing of one of our most potent inhibitors, 1-(2cyclopropylethyl)-3-(1,1-dioxo-1,4-dihydrobenzo[1,2,4]thiadiazin3-yl)-6-fluoro-4-hydroxy-1-quinolin-2-one (130), against a selection of NS5B genotypes demonstrates that compound 130 is a potent inhibitor of genotypes 1a, 1b, and 2a (Table 9), while inhibition of NS5B from genotype 3a is greatly attenuated. The reasons for the attenuation of activity against genotype 3a are unclear at this time. Analysis of the sequences of several type 3a polymerases reveals no obvious mutations in close proximity to the observed binding site for our benzothiadiazine inhibitors. Compound 130 is also highly selective for HCV NS5B versus other viral polymerases (e.g., the closely related GBV-B, IC50 > 50,000 nM) and against human DNA polymerases (IC50 > 50,000 nM) (Table 9). Animal Pharmacokinetics and Safety Assessment. To establish the suitability of our benzothiadiazine inhibitors as potential clinical candidates, the pharmacokinetic profiles of selected compounds were determined in Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgous monkeys. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 10. All four benzothiadiazine inhibitors have moderate plasma half-lives, low plasma clearances, and very good oral bioavailabity (g35%) in all three species. All of the benzothiadiazines tested have relatively low volumes of distribution along with high binding to human plasma proteins (generally >99%). These factors raise concerns over how well the compounds will distribute into the liver tissues, the site of action for the targeted disease. Analyses of liver tissue drug concentrations following oral administration in rats indicate that the compounds distribute well into hepatic tissue, with g2-5-fold liver tissue to plasma concentration ratios for the four compounds tested. Due to the favorable combination of high oral bioavailability and low intrinsic clearance, compound 130 shows high exposure upon oral suspension dosing in rats, dogs, and monkeys [oral DNAUC (µg,h/mL/mg/kg) ) 5.3, 20, and 23.5, respectively].

low-nanomolar replicon activity. The lack of a practical animal model for HCV infection, however, does not allow speculation about the relevance of the replicon system as a means to discover potent clinical HCV polymerase inhibitors, and only clinical data will provide insight on the matter. Experimental Section
Chemistry. General Methods. Starting materials were either commercially available or prepared as reported previously in the literature, unless otherwise noted. Solvents and reagents were used without further purification, except THF, which was distilled from sodium/benzophenone. Reactions were monitored by TLC, performed on silica gel glass plates containing F-254 indicator (Kieselgel 60 F254, Merck or Uniplate Silica Gel GF, Analtech). Visualization on TLC was achieved by UV light, potassium permanganate, or iodine indicator. Column chromatography was performed with Merck 40-63 mesh silica gel. Reaction temperatures refer to the oil bath or cold bath temperature. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-300 or Avance-400 instrument. Chemical shifts () are reported in ppm downfield from internal TMS standard or from solvent references. Mass spectra were recorded on a ScieX API 150EX electrospray LC-mass spectrometer. Melting points were determined on a Melt-Temp apparatus and are uncorrected. Elemental analyses were performed by QTI Technologies, Inc., Whitehouse, NJ. Compound 127 was purchased from AsInEx. General Method for the Alkylation of Isatoic Anhydride. Method A: 1-(3-Methylbutyl)-2H-3,1-benzoxazine-2,4(1H)-dione [7, R ) (CH2)2CH(CH3)2]. Sodium hydride (6.4 g of a 60% suspension in mineral oil, 159.4 mmol) was washed with hexanes, dried under a N2 stream, and suspended in dimethylacetamide (240 mL). Isatoic anhydride (20.0 g, 122.6 mmol) was then added portionwise, followed by i-amyl iodide (24.0 mL, 183.9 mmol). The reaction mixture was then stirred for 20 h at room temperature, poured into ice/water, and stirred for 40 min. The precipitate which formed was collected, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum oven to give the title compound as a tan powder (25.0 g; 58%): 1H NMR (CDCl )  8.17 (dd, J ) 7.9, 1.6 Hz, 1H), 7.76 (ddd, J 3 ) 8.4, 7.4, 1.6 Hz, 1H), 7.29 (t, J ) 7.5 Hz, 1H), 7.15 (d, J ) 8.4 Hz, 1H), 4.09-4.02 (m, 2H), 1.76 (sept, J ) 6.6 Hz, 1H), 1.671.61 (m, 2H), 1.03 (d, J ) 6.6 Hz, 6H). Method B: 1-(3,3-Dimethylbutyl)-2H-3,1-benzoxazine-2,4(1H)-dione [7, R ) (CH2)2C(CH3)3]. Diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (0.663 mL, 3.37 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of isatoic anhydride (500 mg, 3.06 mmol), 3,3-dimethylbutan-1-ol (0.408 mL, 3.37 mmol), and Ph3P (883 mg, 3.37 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10.0 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, concentrated under reduced pressure, and purified by flash chromatography (hexanes/ethyl acetate 75:25) to give the title compound (336 mg, 44%) as a colorless powder: 1H NMR (CDCl3)  8.17 (dd, J ) 7.8, 1.6 Hz, 1H), 7.77 (ddd, J ) 8.54, 7.4, 1.6 Hz, 1H), 7.32 (t, J ) 7.4 Hz, 1H), 7.15 (d, J ) 8.4 Hz, 1H), 4.13-4.05 (m, 2H), 1.68-1.621 (m, 2H), 1.07 (s, 9H). Ethyl (1,1-Dioxido-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)acetate (9). Ester 9 was prepared according to the literature procedure reported

Further profiling of compound 130 reveals that it has no major CYP450 liabilities with the exception of modest potency at inhibiting the 2C9 isozyme (IC50  1 µM) and a modest potential for 3A4 induction (PXR EC50 ) 5.3 µM).21 The clinical relevance of these findings is not clear at this point, but such activities do not preclude advancing compound 130 toward clinical studies. Furthermore, no macroscopic adverse events manifested themselves in a 4-day rat toxicology study at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day in both male and female rats. Importantly, dose proportional increases in AUC are observed, confirming high levels of exposure. In the absence of a readily accessible animal model, the effects of the high affinity for human plasma proteins on the cellular activity of compound 130 can be tested in the replicon assay by the addition of R-acid glycoprotein (AAG), human serum albumin (HSA), or the combination of both. In the presence of 1 mg/mL AAG, the EC50 for compound 130 increases by only 4-5-fold, but the presence of 45 mg/mL HSA reduces the activity of 130 dramatically (Table 11). The relevance of this HSA-mediated attenuation of potency in the replicon system and the impact of protein binding on the in vivo efficacy of compound 130 are, as yet, unknown. It is wellknown that high affinity for plasma proteins can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of, for example, HIV antiretroviral agents;22 however a similar correlation has not yet been established for HCV. It is encouraging, however, as discussed above, that compound 130 preferentially distributes into liver tissues following repeated oral dosing in the rat, despite its high protein binding. Nonetheless, addressing the effects of protein binding on compound potency may be critical to the successful discovery of clinically effective benzothiadiazine non-nucleoside HCV NS5B inhibitors, and work toward this goal will be the subject of future publications. Conclusions A potent class of HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitors has been discovered through high throughput screening of the GSK compound collection. Preliminary SAR studies around this scaffold culminated in the discovery of compound 130, which was ultimately progressed into preclinical development. This class of compounds represents an example of non-nucleoside inhibitors in which excellent RdRp inhibition has translated in

Inhibition of HCV NS5B Polymerization Activity.13 The high-throughput polymerization assay was carried out in 384well plates using 50 or 10 nM NS5B, [R-33P]GTP, GTP, 5biotinylated oligo(rG13)/poly(rC) in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH7.5, MgCl2, KCl, DTT, and 0.05% bovine serum albumine as previously described. After 2 h at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated upon addition of an equal volume of 100 mM EDTA and transferred to a streptavidin-coated FlashPlate. After incubation for 30 min, the plate was washed and counted using a Packard TopCount microplate reader (n ) 4). Method for Positive Strand Replicon HCV-RNA Detection in Replicon Cells.13 Replicon cells were plated at 3 × 103 cells per well in a 96-well plate plates at 37° and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Dulbecco's minimal essential medium) containing 10% FCS (fetal calf serum), 1% NEAA (nonessential amino acids), and 1 mg/mL Geneticin (G418 neomycin). After allowing 4 h for cell attachment, 1 µL of a solution of candidate antiviral agent was added to the medium (n ) 8 wells per dilution). Briefly, 11 2.5-fold dilutions of 1 mM stock test compound in dimethyl sulfoxide were prepared with final concentration ranging from 10,000 to 1.0 nM. Plates were incubated for 40 h, until reaching 80% confluence. After removal of medium, 150 µL of buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added to each well, and RNA purified according to manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen RNAeasy) was eluted twice in 45 µL of distilled H2O prior to RT-PCR. Approximately 40 µL of TaqMan EZ RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) master mix (1× TaqMan EZ Buffer, 3 mM Mn(OAc)2, 0.3 mM dATP, 0.3 mM dCTP, 0.3 mM dGTP, 0.6 mM dUTP, 0.2 mM neo-forward, 0.2 mM neo-reverse, 0.1 mM neo-probe, 1× cyclophilin mix, 0.1 unit/µL rTth DNA polymerase, 0.01 unit/µL AmpErase UNG, and H2O to 40 µL) was added to each tube of 96-tube optical plate along with 10 µL of RNA elution. Primers and probes specific for the positive strand RNA detection of the neomycin gene were as follows: neo-forward, 5CCGGCTACCTGCCCATTC3 (SEQ ID NO 1); neo-reverse, 5CCAGATCATCCTGATCGACAAG3 (SEQ ID NO 2); neo-probe, 5FAM-ACATCGCATCGAGCGAGCACGTAC-TAMRA3 (SEQ ID NO 3). For negative strand RNA detection, the cDNA primer used was 5ACA TGC GCG GCA TCT AGA CCG GCT ACC TGC CCA TTC3 (SEQ ID NO 4), wherein the first 18 bases represent SEQ ID NO 5 linked to neo sequences: neo-forward tag, 5ACA TGC GCG GCA TCT AGA3 (SEQ ID NO 5); neo reverse, 5CCAGATCATCCTGATCGACAAG3 (SEQ ID NO 6); neo probe, 5FAM-ACA TCG CAT CGA GCG AGC ACG TAC-TAMRA3 (SEQ ID NO 3). Additionally, the PDAR control reagent human cyclophilin was used for normalization. Samples were mixed briefly and placed in an ABI7700 (Applied Biosystems) at 50 °C for 2 min; 60 °C for 30 min; and 95 °C for 5 min, with cycling parameters set to 94 °C and 20 s, 55 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The relative cDNA levels for neo and cyclophilin were determined compared to DMSO-only treated controls and the ratio of neo:cyclophilin was used for IC50 calculation (n ) 8). Method for Negative Strand Replicon HCV-RNA Detection in Replicon Cells.13 To achieve strand-specific detection, a primer containing HCV RNA (or replicon RNA sequences such as neomycin gene) and an 18 base tag of nonrelated sequence at the 5 end was for the reverse transcription (RT) reaction: 5ACATGCGCGGCATCTAGACCGGCTACCTGCCCATTC3 (SEQ ID NO 4). A Thermoscript-RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) was used for the room-temperature reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol, with approximately 9 µL of the cell-harvested RNA and 1 µL of primer (10 µM) incubated with room temperature at 60 °C for 1 h. Following that incubation, 2 µL of cDNA product containing the 5 tag was amplified for TaqMan quantification using 48 µL of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as well as the following primers: neo-forward tag, 5ACA TGC GCG GCA TCT AGA3 (SEQ ID NO 5); neo reverse, 5CCAGATCATCCTGATCGACAAG3 (SEQ ID NO 6); and neo probe,

5FAM-ACA TCG CAT CGA GCG AGC ACG TAC-TAMRA3 (SEQ ID NO 3). Samples were mixed briefly and placed in an ABI7700 (Applied Biosystems) at 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, with cycling parameters set to 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The negative strand copy number in each reaction was determined using linear regression analysis based on the slope and intercept generated with a negative strand copy standard curve. The negative strand copies per cell were determined by dividing the total negative strand copies per reaction by the total cells per reaction.
