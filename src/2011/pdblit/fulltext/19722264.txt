ABSTRACT The N-terminal region of the chemokine RANTES is critical for its function. A synthesized N-terminally modified analog of RANTES, P2-RANTES, was discovered using a phage display selection against living CCR5-expressing cells, and has been reported to inhibit HIV-1 env-mediated cell­cell fusion at subnanomolar levels (Hartley et al. J Virol 2003;77:6637­6644). In the present study we produced this protein using E. coli overexpression and extensively studied its structure and function. The x-ray crystal structure of P2-RANTES was solved and ° refined at 1.7 A resolution. This protein was found to be predominantly a monomer in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation, but a tetramer in the crystal. In studies of glycosaminoglycan binding, P2-RANTES was found to be significantly less able to bind heparin than wild type RANTES. We also tested this protein for receptor internalization where it was shown to be functional, in cell­cell fusion assays where recombinant P2-RANTES was a potent fusion inhibitor (IC50 5 2.4 6 0.8 nM), and in single round infection assays where P2-RANTES inhibited at subnanomolar levels. Further, in a modified fusion assay designed to test specificity of inhibition, P2-RANTES was also highly effective, with a 65-fold improvement over the fusion inhibitor C37, which is closely related to the clinically approved inhibitor T-20. These studies provide detailed structural and functional information for this novel N-terminally modified chemokine mutant. This information will be very useful in the development of more potent anti-HIV agents. PDB Accession Number: 2vxw.

INTRODUCTION Chemokines bind to seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and mediate leukocyte activation and migration that is involved in a wide range of physiological phenomena including immunodefense, inflammation, wound healing and cancer development.1­5 The CC chemokine, CCL5/RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) can bind and activate the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5.1,3,4 RANTES can consequently mediate activation and chemotaxis of macrophages (or monocytes), eosinophils, basophils, and T cells.5,6 Due to its ability to mobilize these cell types, increased RANTES expression is related to a wide range of inflammatory disorders and pathologies. Importantly, RANTES also inhibits HIV entry and infection by competing with the virus for CCR5 binding, and as such has been a target for anti-HIV drug design.1,7­11 Mutagenesis experiments have supported the hypothesis that the N-terminal region of RANTES is the determinant for activation of the receptor, and portions of the N-loop (among other regions) (from residue 12­22) are important for receptor binding.12 For

example, Pro2, Asp6, Thr7 are involved in activating CCR1, Pro2 and Tyr3 for CCR3, and Tyr3 and Asp6 for CCR5.12 Regarding receptor binding, it has been found that Arg17 is necessary for RANTES binding to CCR1, Phe12 for binding to CCR3, and Pro2, Phe12 and Ile15 for binding to CCR5.12 Several N-terminally truncated derivatives, N-terminally extended mutants and N-terminal modification mutants have also been tested and these exhibit antagonist or partial agonist functions. For example, the N-terminal peptide fragments RANTES(1­14),13 N-loop fragments,14 as well as the N-terminal truncation mutants RANTES (3­68),15 RANTES (4­68),16 RANTES (8­68),17 RANTES (9­68)17,18 and RANTES (10­68)17 were reported to be antagonists in CCR5 binding and to block HIV fusion. Met-RANTES and Leu-RANTES mutants are extended at the N-terminus by one amino acid and show the ability to tightly bind but to not activate CCR5 (or activate very weakly),19­24 while C1.C5 RANTES also uses only natural amino acids to modify RANTES to obtain strong anti-HIV activity with low agonistic function.22 Subsequently, a range of N-terminal chemically modified derivatives of RANTES, including AOP-RANTES,25 NNY-RANTES,26 and PSCRANTES,16,27­29 were widely reported to be highly effective in blocking HIV-1 infection. In an attempt to improve the ability of RANTES to block HIV entry, a phage display library using randomization of the N-terminal region of RANTES was applied to select RANTES mutants against living cells expressing CCR5.30 In this work, a potent anti-HIV mutant named P2-RANTES was obtained, having a modified N-terminal sequence: FSPLSSQSS-RANTES (10­68).30 The chemically synthesized polypeptide of P2-RANTES was shown by these authors to selectively activate CCR5, but not CCR1 or CCR3, in calcium release experiments. A competition assay also revealed that this mutant has improved binding affinity to CCR5 compared to the wild type protein. In an env-mediated cell­cell fusion assay and PBMC infection assay, P2-RANTES resembles AOPRANTES in function because of its tight binding affinity and strong ability to down-modulate CCR5.30 However, the structure of P2-RANTES and the manner in which this chemokine variant interacts with CCR5 is unknown. Indeed, until very recently when variations of P2RANTES were produced,31 P2-RANTES was the most potent anti-HIV chemokine variant yet discovered that contains all natural amino acids, and is on par with synthetically modified AOP-RANTES and NNY-RANTES. To investigate the structural basis of this unique protein we produced P2-RANTES using E. coli overexpression and refolding techniques and solved the structure by x-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of P2-RANTES shows that the N-terminally extended residue, Phe0, plays an important role in the oligomerization and packing. The first 9 residues on the N-terminus of P2-RANTES are clearly defined due to the oligomerization restraints.

In particular, the first three residues are well-defined while these residues are generally not defined in NMR and x-ray structures of RANTES.32­34 Furthermore, we used a cell mediated competition fusion assay to study this protein and found that this recombinant protein is a much more potent HIV fusion inhibitor than C37, a peptide similar to the clinically available fusion inhibitor T-20.35,36 These findings may aid in the design of potent anti-HIV entry inhibitors and may also be therapeutically useful in the design of antagonists for CCR1 and CCR3.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Cell culture and cell lines

A HeLa cell line stably expressing HIV-1 ADA (R5) env (referred to as HeLa-ADA) was a kind gift from Dr. M. Alizon and Dr. Anne Brelot (Cochin Institute, Paris, France).37 Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and 100 units of penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin and the ADA (R5) env was selectively expressed by adding 2 lM methotrexate (Sigma) as previously described.38 A HeLa cell line stably expressing human receptor CD4 and CCR5 (referred to as HeLa-P5L) was a kind gift from Dr. M.

with 100 units of penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. The Hela HL2/3 cell line (containing genes from the X4 strain HXB2) was obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (product number 1294, from Dr. Barbara K. Felber and Dr. George N. Pavlakis) and was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 500 ug/uL G418.
Protein expression and purification

Wild type RANTES was purified as described previously.40 For the RANTES mutant P2-RANTES, its corresponding gene30 with the codons for the addition of a Factor Xa cutting site upstream was amplified through PCR using the wild type RANTES as a template. The PCR product of P2-RANTES was inserted into pET32-Xa (Novagen) at the Nco I-BamH I sites, and the DNA sequence of this mutant was confirmed through DNA sequencing. Protein production was induced by addition of IPTG to 1 mM in 378C culture of BL21(DE3) (Novagen) bearing the constructed plasmid, and the cells were harvested after 7 h by centrifugation at 6000 g in an F10S-6X500y rotor (Piramoon Technologies) for 30 min. The cells were resuspended in 30 mL of 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris (pH 8), and 10 mM benzamidine and French pressed twice at 16,000 psi. After centrifugation for 30 min at 17,000 g in an SS34 rotor (Sorvall Instruments), the pellet was resuspended in 20 mL of 5 M guanidinium chloride, 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 500 mM NaCl. The solution was stirred overnight and then centrifuged for 30 min at 17,000 g to remove remaining insoluble pellet. The soluble denatured proteins were loaded onto a 5 mL Ni chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated with the same buffer [5 M guanidinium chloride, 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 500 mM NaCl]. The denatured proteins were purified through the chelating column using a gradient from 10 to 100% of 500 mM imidazole in 5 M guanidinium chloride, 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 500 mM NaCl. The fractions containing purified denatured protein were pooled together and shaken for 2 h at room temperature after adding 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol. The purified denatured proteins were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 buffer overnight at 48C to remove denaturant and refold. After dialysis, precipitated matter was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 g in an F14S-6X250y rotor (Piramoon Technologies) and the protein was purified on a C4 reversed phase chromatography column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA), and lyophilized on a Labconco freeze dry system. To remove the fusion tag, the protein powder was solubilized into $1 mL of 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 2.5) and the volume was increased to $40 mL in sterile 20 mM Tris (pH 8), 50 mM NaCl, and 2 mM CaCl2. Factor Xa (Novagen) was used for the proteolytic cleavage, which typically took 2 weeks at room temperature. SDS-PAGE was used to monitor the cutting

reaction. Finally, the cut proteins were purified over a C4 reversed phase chromatography column and lyophilized into powder. Protein concentration was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient method published by Pace.41 As a control for this method of determining concentration, lyophilized powder was weighed on an Ohaus Voyager balance (Pine Brook NJ), and then dissolved in 10% acetonitrile, 0.01% TFA and its absorbance measured. It was determined that the Pace method overestimated the actual concentration of the protein by about 15% when absorbance was measured on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer (Fullerton, CA), and by about 30% when absorbance was measured on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop/ ThermoScientific Wilmington, DE). However, there was some variability in the actual measurement of the weight of protein powder given the small amounts involved, so the well-established Pace method was used in the results reported here.
Crystallization of P2-RANTES

The lyophilized P2-RANTES sample was resuspended in 0.05% TFA at a concentration of 2 mM. 2 lL of this protein solution was mixed with 2 lL of precipitant: 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, 200 mM ammonium sulfate, 20% PEG3350. Crystals were grown in hanging drops using a 48 well crystal screen plate (Hampton) with the reservoir solution being the same as the precipitant. Small monoclinic crystals were grown in 1­2 days and allowed to continue to grow for about 1 week to get ready for diffraction data collection. The crystal was soaked stepwise in a mother-liquor containing 5­25% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data was collected using an RAXIS IV image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku Micromax-007HF generator. The P2-RANTES crystal belongs to C2 space group with four molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The diffraction data was processed with the HKL2000 suite. Statistics of the diffraction data are listed in Table I.
Structural determination and refinement

The structure of P2-RANTES was determined by molecular replacement using the structural model of AOP-RANTES (PDB id: 1B3A) as a search model. The first 10 residues were deleted from the search model. Four molecules of the search model were located in the unit cell using the program MOLREP in the CCP4 suite.42 The solution was improved by rigid body refinement using CNS.43 The electron density map calculated from the model after rigid body refinement showed clear and complete electron density for the first 10 residues for one of the mutant molecules and fragmented density for another molecule. No electron density was observed for the first nine residues of the other two molecules in the asymmetric unit, which are presumed to be disorPROTEINS

P2-RANTES was dissolved in buffer containing 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, with 1000 mM NaCl. The protein sample was loaded in a double sector 12 mm aluminum centerpiece and at a rotor speed of 60,000 rpm at 208C for 24 h in a continuous scan model. For both equilibrium and velocity experiments, the reference compartments were loaded with the matching buffer without proteins and samples were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Analysis of the raw data was carried out using UltraScan version 8.0 (http://www.ultrascan.uthsca.edu). The partial specific volume of P2-RANTES was estimated using the amino acid composition methods implemented in UltraScan. The Hydrodynamic corrections for buffer conditions were calculated by UltraScan. For the equilibrium experiments, data were analyzed using the Global Nonlinear Least-Squares fitting methods implemented in UltraScan. The equilibrium data were also analyzed using the program Origin (Beckman), and the results were found to be very consistent with those from UltraScan. For velocity experiments, data were analyzed using the enhanced van Holde-Weschet method in UltraScan.44,45

The model was refined by several cycles of positional refinement and remodeling. In the final stage of the refinement, individual B factors were refined and solvent molecules were added to peaks higher than 3r in the difference map. The crystallographic R factor for the final model is 21.7% and Rfree is 24.8%, with good geometry. Statistics of the crystallographic data and refinement are listed in Table I.
Analytical ultracentrifugation

N labeled wild type RANTES and P2-RANTES were produced in minimal medium with 15-NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. The purified lyophilized powders were dissolved in 10% D2O with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 2.8 (wild type RANTES) and pH 3.0 (P2-RANTES). The samples were placed in Shigemi tubes (Allison Park, PA) and the spectra referenced relative to DSS (2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate).46 NMR spectra were acquired at 258C on a Varian Unity Plus 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with an xyz gradient penta probe. 15 N-1H HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) spectra were collected with 512* points in the proton dimension and 128* points in the nitrogen dimension. The data were processed using the program nmrPipe47 and analyzed using the program PIPP.48 The selected assigned peaks are labeled using the information from the previously published NMR data.33
Cell­cell fusion assay

Sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity measurements were carried out with a temperature-controlled Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An-60 Ti rotor and a photoelectric scanner (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). For equilibrium experiments, varying concentration (20, 25, and 35 lM) of P2-RANTES were dissolved in buffer containing 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, with 200 mM NaCl. In some cases 15N P2-RANTES was used, since this material is also suitable for NMR. However, the overall conclusions regarding oligomeric state were identical to the use of 14 N P2-RANTES. Samples were loaded onto a 12 mm aluminum six channel centerpiece and run at 35,000, 45,000, and 55,000 rpm at 208C for 16 h for each speed in a step scan model. For velocity experiments, 40 lM of

Envelope-mediated cell­cell fusion assays were carried out as described in reference37,38 with HeLa-P5L and HeLa-ADA cell lines with minor modification. Briefly, 104 HeLa-P5L cells were seeded in 96-well culture plate in 50 lL RPMI-1640 medium per well for 4­5 h. For the 3T3 competition assay, an equal number of HeLa-P5L and 3T3 cells were mixed such that the total concentration of cells were 104 per well (0.5 3 104 each) in 100 lL RPMI-1640 medium. After 12­14 h of incubation the medium was aspirated and replaced with 50 lL RPMI1640 medium. The sample of P2-RANTES or C37 was added into the cell medium with serial dilution from 428 nM to 66 pM (protein concentration was quantified

by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm from a concentrated stock). After preincubation at room temperature for 10 min, 50 lL HeLa-ADA (104 cells per well) in RPMI-1640 medium were added into the 96-well culture plate. After a further 24 h of incubation at 378C for complete fusion, the medium was aspirated and the cells in the 96-well culture plate were lysed by adding 20 lL 0.5% NP-40 (US Biological) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and assayed for b-galactosidase activity by the addition 30 lL of 8 mM substrate CRPG (Sigma) in PBS with 20 mM KCl and 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol for 1­2 h in the dark at room temperature. The absorbance at 570 nm (using a reference wavelength of 630 nm) was read on a microplate reader (Biotek). The percentage of the cell­cell fusion was expressed as 100x (mean absorbance of treated well--mean absorbance of HeLa-P5L only well)/(mean absorbance of untreated well--mean absorbance of HeLa-P5L only well). Experiments were performed in triplicate, in three or more independent experiments, and dose dependent inhibition curves were fitted with a four-parameter logistic equation49 using KaleidaGraph (version 3.6, Synergy Software).
Pseudotyped viral assay

in PBS-0.5% BSA, and kept on ice for 30 min. One aliquot of untreated cells were incubated with PBS-BSA for 30 min followed by three washes and incubation with the FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG as a control. Then the cells were washed three times with cold PBS-0.5% BSA and kept in PBS-0.5% BSA, and analyzed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, SanJose, CA) flow cytometer using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) acquisition software. Cell viability was determined by staining with propidiumiodide (PI) at 1 lg/mL final concentration 1 min before analysis. FITC fluorescence was collected through a 515/30 band pass filter, and PI fluorescence through a 650LP filter. List mode data were acquired on a minimum of 10,000 viable cells defined by a light scatter and lack of PI staining. Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). First, a region to define cells was set using a forward and side light scatter plot, then viable (PI-negative) cells were determined by a plot of forward light scatter and PI fluorescence. Results are presented as histograms of FITC fluorescence.
Heparin sepharose chromatography

293 FT cells were cotransfected with pNL luc3 R- Eand pSV-ADA or pSV-JRFL50 (a kind gift from Dr. Nathaniel Landau) according to the transfection reagent manual (ProFection1 Mammalian Transfection System ­ Promega). Supernatants containing virus were collected 48 h post-transfection, spun down and filtered with 0.45 lm syringe filters to remove viral clusters. The virus produced in this system is infectious for one round only, because the genes for the viral surface proteins (env genes) are on a vector (not the genome) and are therefore not transmitted to progeny virus after infecting a target cell. For viral titration, Quick Titer Lentivirus Quantification Kits were used. 104 TZM cells/well were infected with 50­100 ng p24/well. After 48 h of incubation, cells were lysed and assayed using the Promega Luciferase assay system. 96 well plates were read using an Orion II microplate luminometer (Berthold Techniques, Germany).
FACS analysis

GAG binding capacity of chemokine mutants was studied by using heparin Sepharose chromatography as mentioned in previous publications.51 Briefly, wild type RANTES or P2-RANTES ($10 lg of lyophilized protein) was taken up in 0.5 mL of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and injected onto a 1 mL Hi-Trap heparin column (Pharmacia) using the AKTA HPLC system (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with 5 mL of the same buffer followed by a gradient of 0 to 1200 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) at a rate of 0.5 mL/min for 60 min. The elution profile was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The salt concentration corresponding to the center of each eluted peak is an indication of the GAG binding ability of that protein. Each experiment was repeated two times. RESULTS
Protein production and characterization

HeLa-TZM cells (105) were incubated for 30 min at 378C in culture medium containing various concentration of (0­100 nM) of reagents (i.e. P2-RANTES) in 10 3 75 mm culture tubes (Fisher Scientific). After washing 4 times with 10 mL cold PBS, cells were incubated in 300 lL of 500 lg/mL mouse anti-human CCR5 monoclonal antibody in PBS-0.5% BSA (Sigma), and kept on ice for 45 min. The cells were then washed three times with cold PBS-0.5% BSA and incubated in 300 lL of 50 lg/mL FITC labeled polyclonal goat anti-mouse antibody

P2-RANTES was largely an inclusion body when overexpressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). After refolding, the soluble His-tagged protein was purified using a Ni affinity column followed by reversed phase chromatography. After removal of the N-terminal tag using Factor Xa to maintain the exact N-terminal of P2-RANTES sequence, the soluble tag-free protein was finally purified using reversed phase chromatography. The mass spectrum of P2-RANTES indicated that the protein was nearly 97% pure, with a molecular weight of 7894 Æ 8 Daltons (data not shown). This compares well with the molecular weight of 7906 Dalton calculated from the amino acid composition of native P2-RANTES, and

indicates that P2-RANTES produced by E. coli overexpression has the correct sequence, including the critical N-terminal region. The tag-free P2-RANTES was also determined to be folded, as judged by 15N HSQC experiments (measured on 15N isotopically labeled protein), which show good dispersion in the 1H dimension [Fig. 1(A)]. The overlay of the spectrum of P2-RANTES with wild type RANTES shows many peaks in similar positions, indicating structural similarity between the two proteins, although, as will be discussed, the two proteins likely differ in quaternary state in solution.
Anti-HIV function

To test the biological function of P2-RANTES produced from the E. coli overexpression, we carried out a cell­cell fusion assay that is an accepted model of R5tropic HIV infection.38 In the fusion assay, the IC50 for P2-RANTES is 2.4 Æ 0.8 nM [Fig. 1(B)]; the figure shows data in the presence and absence of competition (described below). This is similar to the published results using P2-RANTES produced by complete chemical synthesis (0.6, 1.6 nM).30,31 In our assay, the fusion inhibitor peptide C37 showed an IC50 of 18.2 Æ 7.5 nM. This result indicates that the bacterially produced P2-RANTES is fully functional and is a significantly better inhibitor than the commonly used C-peptide. As expected, P2-RANTES was unable to inhibit cell fusion in a system using gp120 from HXB2, an X4 tropic HIV strain (data not shown). The recombinantly produced P2-RANTES was also tested in single round infection assays using virus pseudotyped with the R5 strains ADA and JRFL. In both cases, P2-RANTES performed well, exhibiting an IC50 for inhibition of infection of 0.58 Æ 0.22 nM for the ADA strain, and 0.46 Æ 0.035 nM for the JRFL strain [Fig. 1(C)]. These assays are sensitive to the cell type that is infected, and preliminarily, P2-RANTES exhibits even better inhibitory capability when used with other cell types (data not shown). In addition to the conventional cell­cell fusion assay, we modified the experiment to include the presence of unrelated cells (referred to as competition with ``unrelated'' cells) to detect whether P2-RANTES exhibits specificity. Several studies indicate that in addition to its HIV gp41 target, the clinically used T-20, a C-peptide which shares a large portion of sequence with C37, can also bind to undefined targets such as cell membrane or lipids.52­55 This possible lack of specificity could be one reason that T-20 requires a very high dosage for clinical use. In this competition assay, in addition to the cells involved in fusion, we added mouse 3T3 cells, which do not contain human CD4, CCR5 or HIV env on the surface. These cells could act as a competitor for nonspecific binding, but should have little or no effect on a fusion inhibitor with specificity for the fusion complex. With

the 3T3 cells present (0.5 3 104 3T3 cell/well, 1 3 104 HeLa-ADA/well, 0.5 3 104 HeLa-P5L/well), C37 was shown to have a significantly reduced inhibitory capacity, with an IC50 of 61.4 Æ 7.9 nM [Fig. 1(B)]. As a control, 3T3 cells were shown not to affect the fusion process or the speed of fusion (data not shown). Overall, the approximately three-fold decrease of potency in the inhibition of cell­cell fusion by C37 is apparently due to the presence of 3T3 cells. Interestingly, in the same type of experiment, P2-RANTES was shown to have an IC50 of 0.94 Æ 0.5 nM when 3T3 cells are present [Fig. 1(B)], which is unchanged from an IC50 of 0.91 Æ 0.5 nM which is obtained when the assay is done with the same number of cells but lacking the 3T3 competitor cells. (The assay is sensitive to the number of cells used, which is why these numbers are slightly different than those reported above.) This indicates that in a complex environment, P2-RANTES may be targeted to the proper cells better than other fusion inhibitors, allowing overall lower doses for clinical effectiveness.
CCR5 down modulation

As mentioned by Hartley et al.30 there are two mechanisms underlying the improved anti-HIV activity of P2-RANTES compared to wild type RANTES: increased binding affinity for CCR5 (allowing it to block access to CCR5), and enhanced capacity in removing CCR5 from the surface of the cell, rendering CCR5 unavailable for interaction with the HIV surface proteins. To provide evidence for the ability of P2-RANTES to down-modulate CCR5, we carried out CCR5 internalization experiments monitored by FACS, similar to those of Hartley et al. but with a different cell line. As shown in Figure 1(D), P2-RANTES strongly internalized CCR5 on HeLaTZM cells in a concentration dependent manner, while the wild type RANTES control did not show significant changes in CCR5 surface expression in the same experiment. The reason for low internalization by wild type RANTES is likely due to the fact that these experiments were carried out on nonleukocytic cells, and incubation times were short. Indeed, these results are in agreement with the previously published work with different CCR5 expression cell lines using the synthesized P2-RANTES polypeptide and wild type RANTES.30
GAG binding studies

Most chemokines are highly positively charged. This property facilitates the binding to GAGs on the surface of cells, which immobilize and present the chemokine, possibly aiding in the establishment of chemokine concentration gradients for leukocyte chemotaxis.1,56­58 The role of GAG binding by chemokines in their antiHIV activity is not clear. Although the amino acids in RANTES that most directly affect GAG binding are in

The experiment is sensitive to number of cells used such that when 104 target cells were used, P2-RANTES inhibited with an IC50 of 2.4 Æ 0.8 nM, which is also described in "Results" section.

the 40's loop of the protein and not particularly important in CCR5 binding,59 the N-terminus of RANTES (which is critically important in CCR5 function and anti-HIV activity) appears to also play a role in GAG binding.59,60 In addition, the dimerization of CC chemokines is mediated by their N-terminal amino acids, and it has been shown that the ability to dimerize is directly related to GAG binding ability.40,61 Therefore,

changes in the N-terminus of CC chemokines, such as those that lead to P2-RANTES, have the potential to affect the GAG binding ability of the protein as well as its oligomerization state and ability to inhibit HIV. Previous studies have suggested that AOP-RANTES may have different GAG binding capability than MetRANTES.34 To determine whether P2-RANTES (which is extensively mutated at the N-terminus compared to
PROTEINS

RANTES) has altered GAG binding capacity, heparin chromatography was carried out at pH 7.4. As shown in Figure 2(A), elution of wild type RANTES from the heparin column was found to require 700 mM NaCl, while P2-RANTES requires only about 550 mM NaCl. This suggests that P2-RANTES indeed has a lower capacity to bind glycosaminoglycans compared to the wild type RANTES.
Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation

Similar to other chemokines, RANTES can dimerize in solution,32,33 and this property has been shown to be critical for in vivo function and is likely to play an

important role in regulation of GAG binding.40,62,63 Because P2-RANTES has many N-terminal amino acid residues mutated from the wild type protein, and the N-terminal region of the protein is critical for dimerization, this may indicate that P2-RANTES has a different oligomerization state than wild type RANTES. We carried out analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments to determine the quaternary structure of P2-RANTES. Our results with multiple concentrations and multiple speeds suggest that P2-RANTES is predominantly monomeric in solution. As shown in Figure 2(B), the sedimentation equilibrium experiments revealed that P2-RANTES fits best to a single component model. The data do not fit to either a monomer-dimer equilibrium or monomer-tetramer equilibrium model. The fitted molecular weight is around 7.7 kDa in 200 mM NaCl, buffered with 50 mM Bis-Tris at pH 5.5. Since ours and other studies suggested that chemokine oligomerization is salt dependent,40,61,64-66 we carried out further sedimentation velocity experiments with higher salt: 1000 mM NaCl in 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 5.5. Using the program UltraScan,44,45 the sedimentation data was transformed into a species population plot. As shown in Figure 2(C), 90% of the population of P2-RANTES under these conditions is a monomer, and 10% of the population is dimer. This again indicates that P2-RANTES is predominantly a monomer that has a weak tendency to dimerize in certain conditions (such as in a high concentration of salt).
Structure determination and description

The overall crystal structure of P2-RANTES is well° defined at 1.7 A resolution with an R free factor of 24.8% (Table I). The overall structure of P2-RANTES is a homotetramer containing four subunits labeled A, B,

The data is fit with a single component model with a fitted molecular weight (MW) of 7.7 kDa (Origin 3.78, Beckman). The calculated molecular weight from amino acid composition is 7.9 kDa. (C) Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments of P2-RANTES were carried out at very high salt concentration to promote dimerization. This representation of the data shows the population of each species versus molecular weight. The molecular weight distribution of P2-RANTES at 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, 1000 mM NaCl indicates that 90% population is in the monomer form (around 8 kDa) and 10% of the population is in the dimer form (around 16 kDa).

C, and D [Fig. 3(A)]. Chain A and chain B have completely defined structures from residues Phe0 to Ser 68. The electron density map of the N-terminal region in chain A and B is clearly defined [Fig. 3(B)]. The N-terminal region in chain C (Phe0-Ser4) and chain D (Phe0Ser5) is disordered, but the rest of the core structure (chain C: Ser5 to Ser68; chain D: Ser7-Ser68) are welldefined. All the monomeric subunits of P2-RANTES from chain A to D share the same tertiary structure as other CC and CXC chemokine monomers, with three antiparallel b strands and an a-helix connected to the third b-strand via a flexible loop. Two left-handed disulfide bridges (Cys10-Cys34, Cys11-Cys50) restrain the overall conformation of the core of the chemokine fold. A short

b-sheet (b0) is formed in the monomers of chain A and chain B from residues Ser8 to Cys10. This region mediates the dimerization in wild type of RANTES,32­34,68 but wild type RANTES has Pro9 in the middle of the small dimerization b sheet, while P2-RANTES has Ala9 in the middle instead. This may make the b0-b0 dimer in P2-RANTES slightly weaker than wild type RANTES. All four monomers contain a long loop (N-loop, or sometimes referred to as the 20's loop) between Cys11 and Pro20. This loop region has been postulated to be a major determinant of binding to CCR5.12,14,64,69,70 After a short 310 helix (Arg21­His23), there are three main antiparallel b-strands formed by Ile24­Tyr29 (b1), Val39­Thr43 (b2) and Gln48­Ala51 (b3). Then each monomer shows a C-terminal a-helix (a1) formed by

residues from Lys56 to Glu66, followed by extended residues Met67 and Ser68. The loop between b1 and b2 (Ser31­Cys34, or sometimes referred to as the 30's loop) contains a Type III reverse turn; the loop between b2 and b3 (Thr43­Asn46, sometimes referred to as the 40's loop) contains a Type I reverse turn; and the loop between b3 and b1 (Asn52­Lys55, or sometimes referred to as the 50's loop) is a Type I reverse turn. The central dimer in the structure between subunits A and B is similar to other determined CC chemokine dimer interfaces, including that of wild type RANTES.32,33 For example, antiparallel b0-b0 interactions are formed by residues Ser8-Ala9-Cys10, hydrogen bonds are formed between Ser7 (N) and Gln480 (O), Ser7 (OG) and Gln480 (OE1), Ser8 (N) and Cys100 (O), Cys10 (N) and Ser80 (O), Cys50 (N) and Ser 50 (O). This is slightly different from the AOP-RANTES and MetRANTES structures in which the hydrogen bonds are formed between Ser5 (O) and Cys500 (N), Asp6(N) and Gln480 (O) and Thr7(OG1) and Gln480 (OE1).34 Phe12 is well-known to be critical for binding to CCR5 and for dimerization.14 In the P2-RANTES dimer between chain A and chain B, Phe12 is observed to make the usual dimer interactions as seen in other CC chemokine dimers. Comparison of the N-termini from both monomers shows the N-terminus of monomer A to be better resolved and more highly ordered than monomer B, with clearer density and lower temperature factors (Fig. 3). The interaction of the peripheral subunits (C and D) with the central dimer (subunits A and B) are not typical of either a CC or CXC intersubunit interaction. These ``tetramer interactions'' appear to be weaker and mediated by the N-terminus of P2-RANTES. While both monomeric and dimeric forms of CC chemokines have been shown to be physiologically relevant,62 the tetrameric form may be an artifact of crystallization, particularly since the present work shows that the predominant form in solution is a monomer, with some contribution of dimer. However, an analysis of the tetramer can be briefly described as follows: the N-terminus of P2-RANTES is extended in length compared to the wild type protein, with an N-terminal Phe termed Phe0. This residue Phe0 from chain A (or chain B) makes contact with hydrophobic clefts on chain C (or chain D). As shown in Figure 3(C), based on the electron density map, Phe0 from monomer A makes hydrophobic interactions with Phe28, Thr30, Ala9, Val40, Cys11, Cys50 of monomer C. The residue Pro2 of chain A (or B) is also found to contact to Ile15, Val49 and Ala13 of chain C (or D). Monomer B and C interact with each other predominantly through backbone hydrogen bonds between residues Phe12, Tyr14, and Ala16 in the two molecules. Hydrophobic interactions between residues Tyr14 (chain B) to Ala16 (chain C), Ala16 (chain B) to Tyr14 (chain C) were also observed at the interface between monomer B and C [Fig. 3(D)].

However, the buried surface area of these A/C or B/D interfaces are much smaller than the dimer interface between monomer A and B (Table II).
Comparison of P2-RANTES structure with other crystal structures of RANTES

There is very little difference in the tertiary structure between the crystal structure of P2-RANTES described here and the crystal structures of Met-RANTES71 and AOP-RANTES.68 The root mean square deviation (rmsd) values for superpositioning the backbone atoms of P2-RANTES residues 6­68 onto the equivalent atoms of the 1eqt (Met-RANTES) and 1b3a (AOP-RANTES) ° ° structures are 0.461 A and 0.461 A, respectively. However, there is a great deal of difference in the N-terminal regions of the monomeric subunit as seen in the overlay of these three crystal structures [Fig. 4(A)]. In contrast to the Met-RANTES structure, in which the conformation of the first three residues was not determined, the extended Phe0, Ser1, Pro2, and Leu3 are seen quite clearly in the P2-RANTES crystal structure between subunit A and subunit B [Fig. 3(B)]. The largest differences among the various RANTES analogs appear to be in the dimer interface. In Figure 4(B), the monomer A from P2-RANTES was used as a reference, and all dimer structures (using subunit A and B in P2-RANTES) were superimposed using UCSF Chimera.67 The monomer­monomer orientation in the dimer of P2-RANTES (red) is somewhat different than AOP-RANTES (purple) or Met-RANTES (gray). In particular, the changes in the N-terminal region propagate to the C-terminus, resulting in the C-terminal a-helix being oriented away from the referenced monomer. Also, Phe0 of P2-RANTES (red stick model) is pointing in a very different direction compared to the AOP group (purple stick model) in AOP-RANTES. Other residues including Ser1, Pro2, and Tyr3 (in P2-RANTES this is Leu3) also show different orientations. The fewer contacts between the subunits of P2-RANTES seem to allow the dimer to flex, as seen in a comparison of the P2 RANTES dimer with Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES.

The conserved four Cys residues were used to superimpose the monomer structure of these three using the ``super match'' function in UCSF Chimera.67 (B) Overlay of the dimer structure of P2-RANTES with Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES. The monomer A from P2-RANTES was used as a reference, and all dimer structures (using subunit A and B in P2-RANTES) were superimposed using UCSF Chimera.67 The monomer­monomer orientation in the dimer of P2-RANTES (red) is somewhat different than AOP-RANTES (purple) or Met-RANTES (gray). In particular, the changes in the N-terminal region propagate to the C-terminus, resulting in the C-terminal a-helix being oriented away from the referenced monomer. Also, Phe0 of P2-RANTES (red stick model) is pointing in a very different direction compared to the AOP group (purple stick model) in AOP-RANTES. Other residues including Ser1, Pro2, and Tyr3 (in P2-RANTES is Leu3) also show different orientations. All figures were made using UCSF Chimera.67

The dimeric structure of P2-RANTES is less compact than the AOP-RANTES structure, as reflected in the total buried surface area [Table II; Fig. 4(B)]. AOP-RANTES buries 24% of the total monomeric solvent accessible surface upon dimerization, and wild type RANTES buries 19% in the determined dimer, whereas P2-RANTES buries only 16% (Table II). The difference in the buried surface area between P2-RANTES and AOP-RANTES, which likely accounts for the weaker dimer in P2RANTES, is due mainly to the tight fit between the Pro2 and AOP groups wrapped around the surface of the neighboring monomer while Pro2 and Phe0 in P2-RANTES are pointing different directions [Fig. 4(A,B)]. In the subunits A and B, P2-RANTES shows the N-termini to be clearly defined, and the extended Phe0 bound to the hydrophobic clefts of the subunit C and D, not interacting with its dimer partner. This is very different from the disordered amino terminus of native RANTES, and different from AOP-RANTES where the AOP group binds to the surface of the other subunit in the dimer.68

DISCUSSION RANTES possesses the unique capacity to bind and activate a range of receptors including CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5. To make a more potent anti-HIV entry inhibitor, Hartley et al. used phage display to both increase the affinity of a RANTES variant for CCR5 as well as increase selectivity, leading to the mutant

P2-RANTES.30 We show here that this unique chemokine mutant can be produced from E. coli and has an impressive HIV inhibitory capability. It is predominantly a monomer in solution, although it possesses the capacity to multimerize as shown in the crystal structure. Very recently, Gaertner et al.31 used P2-RANTES as a starting point in a selection to find an even better set of RANTES derivatives in terms of anti-HIV potency. The anti-HIV function of P2-RANTES expressed from E. coli (IC50 5 2.4 Æ 0.8) was very similar to that of the chemically synthesized protein (IC50 5 0.6 ­ 1.6 nM).31,30 Although it is possible that the E. coli version is slightly less potent, more likely the small difference in inhibitory IC50 is due to variations in assay conditions, which tend to vary slightly from lab to lab. Further, P2-RANTES showed selectivity for fusion inhibition in a cell­cell fusion assay in the presence of competing ``unrelated'' cells, while the peptide C37 does not. C37 shares a great deal of sequence with the clinically approved fusion inhibitor T-20, since both are derived from the sequence of the HIV protein gp41. In the absence of competing cells, P2-RANTES was $18 fold better than C37 at inhibition, while in the presence of competing cells P2-RANTES was $65 fold better than C37. This suggests that in a clinical setting P2-RANTES may be able to retain its high activity even in a complex physiological environment. P2-RANTES is a pure monomer under most solution conditions, as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation [Fig. 2(B)], but the crystal structure reported in this study (crystallized at the same pH as the analytical ultracentrifugation) is a unique tetramer. This

difference in quaternary state could be because of the high concentration and unusual salt conditions used for crystal formation. Other chemokines have been observed to be monomers or dimers in solution while the crystal structures show higher order multimerization.1,4,72 In the functional assays of P2-RANTES reported by Hartley, the authors specifically note that an aromatic residue in position zero is important.30 Here, we report the structure of P2-RANTES, which also shows a structural role for Phe0 that indicates that Phe0 may be important in forming the unique tetramer structure. However, this structural importance may not reflect functional importance. In the recent next-generation RANTES mutants, this Phe0 is most often replaced with Gln.31 Although it is not clear exactly how the extended residue Phe0 in P2-RANTES interacts with CCR5, a comparison of the N-terminus of the structure that we report here to other available RANTES crystal structures shows that the Phe0 is oriented differently than Met0 in MetRANTES or the AOP group in AOP-RANTES: Met0 is undefined in the crystal structure while the AOP group folds back to the surface of the other monomer.34,68 Phe0 in P2-RANTES, however, points away from the dimer of subunit A and subunit B and binds to the hydrophobic cleft of subunit C in the tetramer. This may indicate a different function for Phe0 than the AOP group in an interaction with the receptor, although it could be an artifact of crystallization. RANTES can form higher-order oligomers at high concentration32 or in the presence of GAGs.73 It has been shown in several studies that the GAG binding can alter the oligomerization of chemokines40,62,66 and in particular can tighten the dimer. As shown in Results, P2-RANTES has diminished capacity to bind GAGs compared to the wild type protein [Fig. 2(A)]. This could be due to the weakened dimer in P2-RANTES, as mutations that comprise P2-RANTES such as Tyr3Leu, Asp6Gln, Thr7Ser, Thr8Ser, and Pro9Ala appear to reduce the intersubunit packing, possibly leading to the very weak dimer in P2-RANTES. The relation of the reduced GAG affinity for P2-RANTES and its potent increase in antiHIV fusion activity compared to the wild type protein is not known. In conclusion, we produced the previously reported potent anti-HIV-1 chemokine P2-RANTES from E. coli and found this unique protein to have significantly greater inhibitory potency than the widely used HIV fusion inhibitor, C37, particularly in the presence of competing ``unrelated'' cells. The crystal structure of P2° RANTES was determined at 1.7 A resolution. Several intersubunit contact areas were identified in this tetramer crystal structure, although the protein was found to be a monomer under most solution conditions. This study provides both structural and functional details for this uniquely potent anti-HIV-1 chemokine. Further investigation of P2-RANTES will be of great value in the search

for improved CCR5 receptor antagonists and will facilitate the development of agents to block HIV-1 entry.
