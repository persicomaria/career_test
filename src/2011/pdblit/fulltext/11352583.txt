The Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus was expressed at ca 25 % of total soluble protein in Escherichia coli and puri®ed by an ef®cient large-scale procedure. Puri®ed protein catalysed the conversions of penicillins N and G to deacetoxycephems. Gel ®ltration and light scattering studies showed that in solution monomeric apo-DAOCS is in equilibrium with a trimeric form from which it crystallizes. DAOCS was crystallized ÆFe(II) and/or 2-oxoglutarate using the hanging drop Ê method. Crystals diffracted to beyond 1.3 A resolution and belonged to Ê Ê the R3 space group (unit cell dimensions: a  b  106.4 A, c  71.2 A; a  b  90  , g  120  (in the hexagonal setting)). Despite the structure revealing that Met180 is located close to the reactive oxidizing centre of DAOCS, there was no functional difference between the wild-type and selenomethionine derivatives. X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies in solution generally supported the iron co-ordination chemistry de®ned by the crystal structures. The Fe K-edge positions of 7121.2 and 7121.4 eV for DAOCS alone and with 2-oxoglutarate were both consistent with the presence of Fe(II). For Fe(II) in DAOCS the best ®t to the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) associated with the Fe K-edge Ê was found with two His imidazolate groups at 1.96 A, three nitrogen or Ê and one other light atom at 2.04 A. For the Fe(II) Ê oxygen atoms at 2.11 A in the DAOCS-2-oxoglutarate complex the EXAFS spectrum was successfully interpreted by backscattering from two His residues (Fe-N at Ê 1.99 A), a bidentate O,O-co-ordinated 2-oxoglutarate with Fe-O distances Ê Ê Ê of 2.08 A, another O atom at 2.08 A and one at 2.03 A. Analysis of the X-ray crystal structural data suggests a binding mode for the penicillin N substrate and possible roles for the C terminus in stabilising the enzyme and ordering the reaction mechanism.

DAOCS Active Site

Introduction
The ®rst committed step in the biosynthesis of cephalosporins is expansion of the ®ve-membered thiazolidine ring of penicillin N (1) to deacetoxycephalosporin C (DAOC, 2), which contains the characteristic six-membered cephem ring. Subsequent hydroxylation of DAOC (2) leads to deacetylcephalosporin C (DAC, 3; Figure 1). In prokaryotes, e.g. Streptomyces clavuligerus, the conversions of (1) to (2) and of (2) to (3) are catalysed (at least predominately) by separate enzymes, deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) and deacetylcephalosporin C synthase (DACS). In eukaryotes, e.g. Cephalosporium acremonium, both steps are catalysed by a single, bifunctional enzyme (DAOC/DAC synthase). In C. acremonium DAC (3) is converted by acetylation into cephalosporin C, whilst in prokaryotes alternative pathways lead to other cephems, e.g. in S. clavuligerus DAC (3) is converted via several steps into cephamycin C (4) (for reviews see: Baldwin & Abraham, 1988; Baldwin & Scho®eld, 1992). Medicinally useful cephalosporins are produced by in vitro removal of the D-d-(a-aminoadipoyl)-side-chain from a fermented cephalosporin followed by reacylation with the requisite side-chain (see e.g. Crawford et al., 1995). Alternatively, useful cephems may be obtained by the chemical ring expansion of the corresponding penicillin (Morin et al., 1963; Chauvette et al., 1971; Colvin, 1992). The three oxygenases involved in the conversion of penicillin N (1) to DAOC (2) and DAC (3) are

members of the non-heme Fe(II)-dependent family of dioxygenases (Prescott, 1993; Que & Ho, 1996; Hegg & Que, 1997). Each reaction has a stoichiometric requirement for 2-oxoglutarate and (presumably) dioxygen and in vitro optimum substrate conversion requires the presence of DTT and ascorbate. The hydroxylation of (2) to give (3) may be regarded as a typical type of reaction catalysed by 2-oxoglutarate utilising dioxygenases, but the oxidative ring expansion of (1) to give (2) is unique. Labelling studies on the mechanism of ring expansion indicate that cleavage of the C-H bond of the b-methyl group precedes that of the C-2 C-H bond (Baldwin et al., 1991) and have provided evidence for a methylene radical intermediate (Pang et al., 1984; Townsend et al., 1985). Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS), for which crystal structures have been described (Roach et al., 1995, 1997), catalyses the oxidative bicyclisation of the L-d-(a-aminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-Dtripeptide, valine (ACV, 6) to isopenicillin N (7), the immediate precursor of penicillin N (1) (Figure 1). IPNS does not require a 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrate since it catalyses a four-electron oxidation of (6). The cephalosporin oxygenases clearly have a close evolutionary relationship with IPNS (Cooper, 1993) and comparison of their active sites is of interest, particularly with regard to de®ning the interactions responsible for 2-oxoglutarate binding and turnover. DAOCS from S. clavuligerus was ®rst cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble protein, which was refolded to give soluble, active enzyme for characterization but was unsuitable for crystallization trials (Dotzlaf & Yeh, 1989; Kovacevic et al., 1989). Subsequently, soluble DAOCS was expressed using a plasmid containing the trc promoter, but the level of expression and puri®cation methods were not optimal (Morgan et al., 1994). Herein, we report the over-production, ef®cient puri®cation, crystallization and characterization of DAOCS. The results have implications for the interpretation of the recently reported Ê DAOCS crystal structure (Valegard et al., 1998) and suggest roles for the C termini of DAOCS and related 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.

Results and Discussion
Expression and purification of recombinant DAOCS High-level expression of the DAOCS gene to produce soluble protein was achieved via sub-cloning of the DNA fragment containing the DAOCS gene into the pET11a and pET24a vectors. The resultant plasmids (pML1 and pHL1, respectively) were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). In both cases expression at >25 % of the soluble cell protein was observed two to three hours after induction by IPTG when grown at 27 for 30 C. This level of expression was ca ten times better than that previously obtained using E. coli NM554/pNM88

945 apo-DAOCS showed a absorbance maximum at 278 nm (e  33, 578 MÀ1 cmÀ1), with no signi®cant absorbance above 300 nm. DTNB titrations (Habeeb, 1974) in the presence/absence of SDS were consistent with the presence of seven cysteine residues as predicted. In the absence of SDS, four of the cysteine residues were derivatized signi®cantly faster than the other three. Examination Ê of the DAOCS structure (Valegard et al., 1998; K. Harlos & M. D. Lloyd, unpublished results) suggests that all of the cysteine residues are relatively exposed to solvent but it was not possible to correlate speci®c residues with the observed DTNB titration data. As noted previously (Sami et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1997) the errors in apparent Km and kcat values determined from preliminary steady-state kinetic analysis for Fe(II)-dependent oxidizing enzymes may well be signi®cant and caution should be exercised in drawing mechanistic conclusions from relatively small (i.e. less than an order of magnitude) differences. Puri®ed DAOCS had the following apparent kinetic parameters for penicillin N (1): Km  6.6 (Æ0.8) mM and kcat  0.42 (Æ0.05) sÀ1 (speci®c activity  727 (Æ86) nmol min per mg). Adipoyl-6-APA (8) has been previously shown to be a (poor) substrate for the enzyme (Shibata et al., 1996), being converted into adipoyl7-ADCA (9) with an apparent Km  1.30 (Æ0.10) mM and kcat  0.073 (Æ0.0003) sÀ1 (127 (Æ5.3) nmol/min per mg; Figure 4). Penicillin G (10) was also converted to the corresponding cephem (11) with the following apparent kinetic parameters: Km  2.03 (Æ0.12) mM; kcat  0.062 (Æ0.003) sÀ1 (speci®c activity  108 (Æ5.2) nmol/ min per mg). These are similar to the previously reported values (Km  1 mM; Vmax  87 nmol/min per mg; Morgan, 1994). In preparative conversions using a higher enzyme: substrate ratio, ca 20-30 % conversion of penicillin G (10) to cephem (11) was observed. Analogous preparative experiments with penicillin N (1) demonstrated >95 % conversion to DAOC (2). Based on the present analyses the differences in kcat for the three substrates analysed are probably insigni®cant. The differences in the apparent Km values for penicillin N (1) compared to penicillin G (10) and adipoyl-6-APA (Shibata et al., 1996) are greater being ca 100-fold. Interpretation of these apparent Km values as indicators of binding ability for different substrates to DAOCS should be regarded as tentative, but the available data, implying that penicillin G (10) and adipoyl-6-APA (8) bind to DAOCS with similar af®nities, suggest

Markers (BDH, 10 mg of each protein) were: ovotransferrin (76 and 78 kDa); BSA (66 kDa); ovalbumin (42.7 kDa); carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa); myoglobin (17.2 kDa); cytochrome c (12.3 kDa).

(Morgan et al., 1994) as judged by SDS-PAGE. Soluble expression was not observed when cells were grown at 37  C. The pET24a vector was preferred since it allows the use of single-stranded mutagenesis techniques. Unlike the pET11a vector, the pET24a vector uses kanamycin rather than ampicillin (i.e. b-lactamase mediated) resistance as the selection method and although we could not ®nd any evidence for contamination of puri®ed DAOCS by b-lactamase, the use of this vector reduces this possibility. In the optimised method, crude extracts were puri®ed using anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction and gel ®ltration chromatographies (Figure 2). The use of SOURCE1 15ISO resin enabled very rapid (less than 30 minutes) concentration and puri®cation of the pool from a QSepharose1 HP column. It was possible to purify 150-200 mg of active, crystallography-grade DAOCS within 24 hours (Table 1). Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI MS) of DAOCS gave a mass of 34,554 (Æ3) Da in agreement with the calculated value (34,551 Da; Figure 3(a)). The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequence (including the N-terminal methionine) was obtained for the ®rst 15 residues (data not shown). The UV-visible spectrum of wild-type

Crystallization of DAOCS The ®rst conditions leading to DAOCS crystals used 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 buffer containing 2 mM 2-oxoglutarate and ammonium sulphate. These were re®ned to pH 7.0 and 100 mM HepesNaOH buffer containing 5 mM monopotassium 2-oxoglutarate. Crystals with dimensions of 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm appeared after three to eight weeks (Figure 5). The space group of the crystal was R3 and with a single DAOCS molecule in the asymmetric unit, with the following Ê Ê unit cell dimensions: a  b  106.4 A, c  71.2 A; a  b  90  , g  120  (in the hexagonal setting). Ê The predicted density VM was 2.65 A3/Da (Matthews, 1968). All crystals obtained so far were merohedrally twinned with twinning ratios between 0.06 and 0.45 (Terwisscha van Scheltinga et al., unpublished results) and diffracted X-rays Ê Ê beyond 1.3 A resolution (Valegard et al., 1998). EXAFS EXAFS studies were carried out in order to compare the co-ordination chemistry of DAOCS in solution and crystalline states. This is important because studies on IPNS (Roach et al., 1995, 1997) indicate that signi®cant conformational changes affecting the active site and possibly the co-ordination chemistry of iron(II)-dependent oxidizing enzymes occur upon substrate binding. Signi®cant aspects of the mechanism of 2-oxoglutaratedependent dioxygenases also remain unclear; for example, it is not known if the 2-oxoglutarate is ligated to the iron in a monodentate or bidentate fashion upon binding and reaction of dioxygen, and at what stage carbon dioxide is released from the iron during catalysis. The Fe K-edge positions for Fe(II) DAOCS alone and in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate of 7121.2 and 7121.4 eV, respectively, are both consistent with the Fe(II) oxidation state (Randall et al., 1993). The

that the amino group plays an important role in the binding of the a-aminoadipoyl-side-chain of penicillin N (1). IPNS has a very lax substrate selectivity and is able to catalyse the cyclisation of many analogues of ACV (6) (Baldwin & Bradley, 1990), including the relatively ef®cient conversion of adipoylL-cysteinyl-D-valine to adipoyl-6-APA (8) and D-(a-aminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine to penicillin N (1) (Baldwin et al., 1984, 1990). In contrast DAOCS apparently has tighter selectivity, at least with respect to the presence of the amino group in the side-chain of its substrates. This may be related to the evolution of the pathway and the fact that penicillin N (1) but not isopenicillin N (7) is a substrate for DAOCS and DAOC/DACS. Various metals, including cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper and manganese salts were screened for their ability to catalyse the conversion of penicillin N (1) to DAOC (2) and as inhibitors of the reaction (data not shown). Catalysis was only observed in the presence of added Fe2 or Fe3 (the latter has ca 34 % relative speci®c activity to the former under standard incubation conditions), with the activity observed in the latter case presumably resulting from reduction in solution. When 2 mM Fe(III) was added to the standard incubation mixture containing 2 mM Fe(II) it was inhibitory (>80 % inhibition). Cd(OAC)2 and CuCl2 effected complete inhibition at 2 mM, whilst 2 mM CoCl2 caused ca 50 % inhibition and NiSO4 caused ca 25 % inhibition. The other metal salts tested (CrK(SO4)2, MnCl2 and SnCl2) showed little or no effect on activity.

948 Fe K-edge EXAFS and Fourier transform data (Figure 6(a)) from the Fe(II)-DAOCS complex showed contributions from several shells of backscatterers. The backscattering contributions from the inner shell were successfully simulated using light atoms (C, N, O) only, with no evidence of coordination from heavier elements such as sulphur. Ê Features in the Fourier transform at ca 3 A and at Ê ca 4.2 A are characteristic of imidazole groups (Figure 6(a) and (b)). Fits were attempted using 1-3 imidazole groups, including multiple scattering, with other light atoms to complete the inner coordination sphere. The best ®t was found with two imidazole groups co-ordinating to the iron with Ê Fe-N of 1.96 A, three oxygen (or nitrogen) atoms at Ê Ê 2.11 A, and one other light atom at 2.04 A. A Fe-N Ê bond distance of 1.96 A is more consistent with an imidazolate ligand rather than imidazole. These conclusions are consistent with the results obtained

DAOCS Active Site

from the crystal structure of the DAOCS-Fe(II) Ê complex (Valegard et al., 1998), which show octahedral ligation of the iron by His183, His243, Asp185 and three water molecules (Figure 7(a)). However, the experimental and simulated EXAFS of the DAOCS-Fe(II) complex were not in complete agreement, in particular a feature in the Ê Fourier transform at ca 3.3 A was not readily ®tted by the data analysis given above. We attempted to reproduce this feature by including backscattering from a single heavy atom such as iron or by several light atoms. However, reproduction of the magnitude of the peak using light atoms required unrealistically low or negative Debye-Waller factors. The use of a heavier backscatterer gave the correct amplitude in the Fourier transform but the improvement in ®t of the EXAFS was insuf®cient to justify the inclusion of the additional parameters. The best ®t was found using a light atom

Figure 7. Co-ordination of the Fe(II) atom in DAOCS (a) without 2-oxoglutarate (left); (b) with 2-oxoglutarate (right). The ligand opposite His183 is shown as a water molecule as in the crystal structures. The EXAFS data, however, suggest the possible presence of an alternative ligand in this position; see the text for details. This species is assigned as being trans to His183 since the EXAFS data indicate its presence in both the DAOCS-Fe(II) and DAOCS-Fe(II)-2-oxoglutarate complexes.

Ê (X  O/N/C) at 2.04 A and another light atom (Y) Ê at 3.27 A with the inclusion of multiple scattering for a linear Fe-X-Y group (see below). The EXAFS associated with the Fe K-edge of the DAOCS-Fe(II)-2-oxoglutarate complex and its Fourier transform (Figure 6(b)), whilst similar to the corresponding information for the DAOCSFe(II) complex, showed signi®cant differences Ê (notably in the EXAFS between 8 and 10 AÀ1), indicating that the Fe(II) site has been perturbed by the presence of 2-oxoglutarate. The EXAFS was successfully interpreted by backscattering from Ê two histidine groups (Fe-N at 1.99 A) with a bidentate O,O-co-ordinated 2-oxoglutarate with Fe-O Ê distances of ca 2.08 A, with another O atom at this Ê distance and a light (O or N) atom at 2.03 A (Figure 6(b)). As for the DAOCS-Fe(II) complex, a successful interpretation of the Fe K-edge EXAFS and its Fourier transform required inclusion of backscattering from a linear Fe-X-Y arrangement Ê with the light atoms X and Y being 2.03 and 3.33 A from the iron. Thus, the Fe K-edge EXAFS imply the 2-oxoglutarate replaces two water molecules bound to the iron in the Fe(II) DAOCS complex, which is entirely consistent with the crystal strucÊ ture of the same complex (Valegard et al., 1998) which shows bidentate binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the iron, via the keto-oxygen and one oxygen of the carboxylate group (Figure 7(b)). Since the unuÊ sual feature in the EXAFS at ca 3.3 A is present both before and after 2-oxoglutarate binding the simplest explanation is that it results from a ligand binding to the iron trans to His183, the proposed binding site for dioxygen. However, in the crystal structure this ligand is clearly a water molecule. The identity of the Fe-X-Y group proposed on the basis of the EXAFS studies is unknown; an average

Ê X-Y distance of ca 1.27 A is indicative of a bonded contact but the linearity of the arrangement is surprising and appears to preclude X and Y coming from the carboxylate group of Asp185. Contaminants derived from dioxygen (such as superoxide or peroxide) can probably be excluded, since the Fe K-edge position indicates the presence of iron(II) at the active site. The possibility that this feature arises due to ligation of sodium azide (derived from the buffer) by the iron is also unlikely because a non-linear Fe-N bond would be expected. This discrepancy between the crystallographic and frozen solution EXAFS studies will have to be resolved by further experimentation and analysis. Thus, the EXAFS study provides evidence that the crystal structure re¯ects solution binding of 2-oxoglutarate (Figure 7(b)). Although a reasonable proposal, care should be taken in assuming that the 2-oxoglutarate remains bound to the iron in a bidentate manner at all times during the catalytic cycle prior to fragmentation of 2-oxoglutarate into carbon dioxide and succinate. It is possible that binding of dioxygen and/or substrate triggers a rearrangement to monodentate binding. Spectroscopic studies on 2,4-(dichlorophenoxy)acetate/2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase complexed to Cu(II) (substituting for Fe(II)) and 2-oxoglutarate indicate monodentate binding of 2-oxoglutarate and the carboxylate of the substrate (Whiting et al., 1997). However, it is likely that the substitution of Cu(II) for Fe(II) signi®cantly perturbs the co-ordination chemistry and more recent spectroscopic studies on complexes formed between clavaminate synthase, iron and 2-oxoglutarate indicate bidentate binding of the latter (Pavel et al., 1998).

950 The largest discrepancies between the bond lengths obtained from X-ray crystallographic and EXAFS measurements are for the iron(II)-histidinyl residue bonds. Bond lengths obtained by X-ray crystallography suggest imidazole ligands, whilst the EXAFS measurements are more consistent with imidazolate ligands. These differences may be partially a consequence of the different buffer conditions used in these studies, Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0) with ammonium sulphate in the former case and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 mM NaN3 in the latter. However, in general the atomic distances between a metal and lighter ligands are usually over-estimated in re®ned X-ray structures of proteins. An analysis of available data demonstrates these distances are systematically longer than those obtained from EXAFS measurements. This suggests that the differences arise from technical procedures rather than inherent structural differences between crystalline and solution states. There may be a number of reasons for the apparent discrepancies. During re®nement, in some cases, the iron-ligand distances are treated as non-bonded atoms without additional restraints. Under these conditions, non-bonded contact parameters dominate the re®nement, which results in increased bond lengths. This mistake can be corrected for, e.g. by removing such restraints around the metal and its immediate environment, and ®xing the distances in subsequent restrained re®nement to the values obtained. This procedure often produces bond lengths which agree more closely with values obtained from EXAFS measurements. However, there is another factor to be considered. At the Ê usual resolutions of protein structures (1.5-3.0 A), series termination errors in Fourier synthesis can produce sizeable ripples around heavy metal scatterers, pushing apparent electron densities from lighter ligands to somewhat longer distances than they may be in reality. The number, depth and location of such ripples depends on the resolution and completeness of the data set. At very high resolutions (such as those in small molecule structures) these ripples become negligible. However, at the resolutions of most protein structures they will be present and systematically produce slightly longer distances than EXAFS measurements, even without the restraints in the X-ray re®nement. A source of error in EXAFS measurements should also be considered in situations such as those described herein, where the inner co-ordination sphere of the metal involves atoms with very similar backscattering characteristics at similar but not identical distances. In the interpretation of the EXAFS it is dif®cult to unambiguously determine the individual contributions to the overall backscattering. Useful clari®cation can be obtained when outer shells provide multiple scattering contributions, e.g. those observed with imidazole groups. Role of methionine-180

DAOCS Active Site

Ê The DAOCS crystal structures (Valegard et al., 1998; K. Harlos & M.D. Lloyd, unpublished results) reveal that all (but one) methionine residues are located relatively close to the surface of the protein. The exception, methionine-180, is located within the active site and its side-chain becomes ordered upon binding of 2-oxoglutarate and/or iron(II). In the DAOCS-Fe(II)-2-oxoglutarate complex Met180 is in van der Waals contact with the C-2 atom of Ê the 2-oxoglutarate (Valegard et al., 1998; K. Harlos & M. D. Lloyd, unpublished results). The presence of an easily oxidizable side-chain so close to the reactive centre of DAOCS is somewhat surprising and it is probable that its oxidation to a sulphoxide or sulphone would affect the binding of 2-oxoglutarate and hence catalysis. Despite the observations that selenomethionine residues are more easily oxidized than methionine residues and crystallization of the selenomethionine derivative required anaerobic conditions, there were no apparent functional differences between the wild-type and selenomethionine derivative (Materials and Methods, Figure 3), nor was there any clear ESI MS evidence for oxidative modi®cations of the derivative. Similar speci®c activities were obtained for both, suggesting that the oxidative chemistry occurring within the DAOCS active site is tightly controlled and directed away from Met180, making the possibility of a methionine sulphoxide or radical intermediate during catalysis unlikely.

Significance of the trimeric nature of DAOCS Ê The solution of the DAOCS structure (Valegard et al., 1998; K. Harlos & M. D. Lloyd, unpublished results) demonstrates that it crystallizes as a trimer with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Figure 8). The C-terminal residues from one DAOCS molecule project towards the active site of an adjacent sub-unit in a cyclic manner, forming a trimer. The key intermolecular interactions resulting from trimerization are shown in Table 2. Gel ®ltration analysis indicated that in solution apoDAOCS exists as an equilibrium mixture of monomeric (est. 28.9 kDa) and trimeric (est. 92.9 kDa) forms. The presence of 5 mM 2-oxoglutarate had no apparent effect on the equilibrium position. Dynamic laser light scattering studies showed that apo-DAOCS is predominately trimeric at 15-20  C, pH 7.0. At 20  C the mean hydrodynamic radius was 4.2 nm, corresponding to an apparent mass of 96 kDa. The protein showed a bimodal size distribution in which the trimeric and monomeric forms are in equilibrium. This equilibrium was temperature-sensitive, and shifted towards the monomeric form at 15  C (mean radius  3.4 nm, 57 kDa). Addition of 10-100 mM 2-oxoglutarate alone did not effect the equilibrium position. Addition of 5-10 mM FeSO4 alone to DAOCS induced a shift towards the monomeric form of the enzyme (mean

DAOCS Active Site

951 DAOCS and IPNS are unusual in that they are located within, rather than external to, the jelly roll barrel which forms the core of their structures. It is possible the presence of a C-terminal lid (which combined with other conformational changes would constitute a closed form of the enzyme) on the active site (in either monomeric or trimeric forms) stabilizes the jelly role core of the resting enzyme, thereby reducing the possibility of unfolding and subsequent oxidative or proteolytic damage. Formation of the oligomers in vivo may also be signi®cant if high concentrations of enzyme are present such as in an antibiotic production strain. The potential of the C terminus to adopt different conformations and its involvement in oligomerization should also be noted in respect of crystallization experiments on enzymes of the DAOCS family, in particular with regard to choice of mutant or isoenzyme for study. Both IPNS and DAOCS are unstable in vitro, particularly under catalytic conditions. In part inactivation results from oxidative damage resulting from reactive oxidizing species (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) generated from the requisite cofactors (iron, ascorbate, dioxygen). ACCO is particularly sensitive to this type of oxidative damage, undergoing extensive fragmentation (Barlow et al., 1997). However, it is clear that oxidative damage to a single form of the enzyme is not the only mode of inactivation and it is also unlikely that oxidation (which is likely to be signi®cantly irreversible) explains the differences between the in vitro and in vivo inactivation rates. Upon standing in buffer recombinant ACCO from tomato fruit undergoes a confor-

hydrodynamic radius 3.2 nm, 48 kDa at 20  C). Addition of 5-10 mM FeSO4 with 25-50 mM 2-oxoglutarate resulted in almost complete dissociation to the monomeric form at 20-37  C (mean radius 2.9 nm, 39 kDa). These studies imply that it is the monomeric form of DAOCS which is catalytically active. Indirect support for this proposal came Ê from X-ray crystallographic results (Valegard et al., 1998), which show a clear movement of the C terminus upon binding of iron(II), which was predicted to cause dissociation into the monomer. Further oligomerisation via active site and C-terminal tail interactions may be partially responsible for the observation that DAOCS forms inclusion bodies when over-produced, particularly at 37  C. During refolding studies (data not shown) on DAOC/DACS an apparent temperature-dependent tendency to form oligomers was also noticed and this may also re¯ect the operation of an oligomerization process. Role of the C terminus and substrate binding Comparison of the DAOCS and IPNS-Mn structures reveals strikingly similar general relationships between their active sites and C termini. In the structure of IPNS complexed to manganese (substituting for Fe(II)) Gln330 ligates to the metal, and thus the C terminus forms a ``lid'' over the active site, an arrangement also observed in the case of DAOCS. However, in the case of the DAOCS crystal structure the C-terminal lid is derived not from the same molecule, but from a neighbour in the trimeric unit. The active sites of

DAOCS Active Site

mational change to a less active form in which the main secondary structure elements are conserved. Supporting evidence for the proposal that a conformational change contributes to inactivation includes mutagenesis experiments which demonstrate that oxidative fragmentation of ACCO, which occurs as a burst upon addition of substrates/cofactors, only occurs in a form of the enzyme in which the iron is ``incorrectly'' ligated for catalysis (Zhang et al., 1997). The predicted inherent mobility in the C-terminal region of DAOCS and related enzymes, speci®cally the interconversion between open and closed forms, and the possibility of misfolding (and enhanced susceptibility to oxidative damage) in the former or intermediate forms, may well be a major cause of the notorious instability of this family of enzymes. It also explains the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo inactivation rates, since refolding mechanisms will exist in the latter case. In the IPNS-Mn structure Gln330, the penultimate residue on the C terminus, acts as a fourth protein-based iron ligand (Roach et al., 1995), which is displaced upon ACV (6) binding (Roach et al., 1997). In contrast, the DAOCS structure reveals only three protein-derived iron ligands and the EXAFS data do not provide evidence for a fourth protein ligand. Thus, the DAOCS studies support mutagenesis studies with IPNS, concluding that iron ligation by a C-terminal residue is not required for catalysis (Sami et al., 1997; Borovok et al., 1996). The structures suggest that the DAOCS C terminus may assist in ordering binding of substrates to the active site. Thus, whilst 2-oxoglutarate can co-ordinate to the iron in the closed form, in order for penicillin N (1) to bind to the active site of DAOCS, the C terminus must be displaced to give a more open form of the enzyme. Thus, although DAOCS crystallizes as a trimer and can exist in this form in solution, it is the monomer which is the catalytically active form. A possible hinge allowing movement of the C terminus with respect to the active site is between residues 298 and 302 (IGGNY), a well conserved sequence in DAOCS (S. clavuligerus, Norcardia lactamdurans),

DACS (S. clavuligerus, Norcardia lactamdurans) and DAOCS/DACS (C. acremonium) (Cooper, 1993), suggesting that the C terminus is also important in the DACS and DAOC/DACS catalytic cycles (see below). Examination of the interactions between the C-terminal residues (Asn304H to Ala311H ) of one DAOCS molecule and the active site of another (Figure 8) suggests a binding mode for the penicillin nucleus (Figure 9(a)). The penam C-3 carboxylate group probably occupies an analogous position to that of Ala311H from a symmetry-related molecule in the active site (Figure 8), forming electrostatic interactions with Arg162 and Arg160 (Figure 9 and Table 2). The side-chain of Arg160 may also be in position to form a hydrogen bonding interaction with the b-lactam nitrogen/carbonyl. Asn304, close to the C terminus of the enzyme, may form a hydrogen bond with the amide bond linking the side-chain to the penicillin nucleus. Although anticipated from sequence analyses, the observation that the side-chains of the highly conserved Arg258 and Ser260 residues bind to the 5-carboxylate of 2-oxoglutarate is of interest, since the analogous residues in IPNS (together with Tyr189 and a water molecule) bind the ACV (6) valine carboxylate. Within the family of known iron-dependent oxidizing enzymes clearly related by sequence to DAOCS only two, IPNS and ACCO, do not use a 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrate with ACCO apparently using ascorbate in the place of 2-oxoglutarate. Thus, it seems most probable that IPNS evolved from a 2-oxoglutaratedependent oxygenase rather than vice versa. The presence of Arg160 and Arg162 in the DAOCS active site is a signi®cant difference compared to that of IPNS (Figure 9(b)). In the structure of IPNS complexed to iron(II) and ACV (6), apart from the residues complexing to the iron and those forming electrostatic interactions with the valine carboxylate, the active site is largely devoid of polar residues. In the proposed mechanism for IPNS (Roach et al., 1997) the iron-bound oxidizing species are isolated from the environment in part by the presence of the ACV (6) substrate, which is wrapped around them. The presence of the extra electrostatic interactions in the DAOCS active site relative to that of IPNS re¯ect its requirement to bind and position an extra substrate with a carboxylate group, penicillin N (1). Mechanistic implications Kinetic studies on other 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases (Holme, 1975) have demonstrated ordered sequential binding of 2-oxoglutarate and the prime substrate followed by that of dioxygen, as shown for DAOCS in Figure 10. Binding of penicillin N (1) (and 2-oxoglutarate) probably occurs to an open form of the enzyme. Binding of penicillin N (1) may also assist dioxygen binding via displacement of the water molecule ligated to

the iron trans to His183. Formation of a ferryl complex may then occur as proposed previously Ê (Valegard et al., 1998) via superoxide or peroxide intermediates in an isolated environment, i.e. a closed form of the enzyme. Carbon dioxide may remain co-ordinated to the ferryl iron, possibly as a bicarbonate ion after reaction with water. Together with the carboxylate derived from the succinate continued ligation of the carbon dioxide/ bicarbonate may serve to modulate or direct the reactivity of the ferryl species. Isotopic labelling experiments have demonstrated that cleavage of a C-H bond of the penicillin pro-S methyl group occurs before cleavage of the C-3 C-H bond (Baldwin et al., 1991): Binding of penicillin N (1) in the proposed manner projects this methyl group directly towards the iron centre whilst the C-3 C-H bond is further away. The isolated nature of the active site in the closed form, the distance of the thiazolidine sulphur from the iron and the requirement for (at least) one of the iron ligands to be decomplexed renders mechanisms involving complexing of the penam sulphur to the iron unlikely. We presently favour a mechanism in which a ferryl intermediate, generated as Ê previously proposed (Valegard et al., 1998), reacts with the pro-S methyl group to generate a primary

radical (Pang et al., 1984; Townsend et al., 1985). Biomimetic studies (Baldwin et al., 1988) suggest that this species enters an equilibrating manifold of radicals in which a tertiary cepham radical predominates. This may react with the Fe-OH species, either to give DAOC (2) and water (Figure 10, path A) or to form the 3b-hydroxymethylcepham (12) (Figure 10, path B; Baldwin et al., 1991). Alternatively, single electron transfer from the intermediate radical(s) may occur (Figure 10, path C) to give a cation, which must lose a proton to give DAOC (2) (Figure 10, path D) or which reacts with water/hydroxide to give (12) (Figure 10, path E). Since no protein derived functionality, including the side-chains of both Arg162 and Arg160 which are on the ``wrong'' face of the intermediates, is in position to act as a general base to deprotonate the C-2 C-H, it seems likely that (if a cationic mechanism is in operation) one of the three substrate-derived iron ligands acts in this manner. The binding model implies the position trans to His183 as the likely location for an iron ligated base. Further, use of a succinate oxygen as a general base would seem unlikely, since it is locked into a highly electron-de®cient iron centre. It is possible that the CO2 derived from 2-oxoglutarate reacts with water to form bicarbonate, which

955 hydroxylase, where the natural substrate is a polymer, collagen, with a considerable degree of secondary structure, which may make precise arrangement of the proline residues within the active sight of prolyl-4-hydroxylase awkward. The mechanistic complexity of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases ensures that many questions remain unanswered, but the present work, together with that of the recently reported Ê crystal structures (Valegard et al., 1998), places previous mechanistic studies within a structural context and provides new detailed proposals. It is important that future studies are now directed towards the structural characterization of intermediates in the catalytic cycle.

acts as a base. In our mechanism this would place the bicarbonate trans to His243, possibly rendering it too far away to cleave the C-3 C-H bond directly. Thus, the bicarbonate may serve to increase the basicity of the hydroxyl trans to His183, which may act as a base, deprotonating the cationic intermediate to give (2) or quench it to give (12). Migration of the CO2 to the hydroxyl group trans to His183 is another, less likely, possibility. Kinetic studies imply that carbon dioxide is the ®rst released product in 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase catalysis (Holme, 1975) and it may be that return of the metal to the iron (II) oxidation state facilitates release of CO2 (or bicarbonate) from the metal, which in turn triggers conformational changes, including movement of the Cterminal region, to give a more open form of the enzyme, allowing release of DAOC and succinate. DAOCS like other 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases can catalyse the ``uncoupled'' turnover of 2-oxoglutarate to succinate and carbon dioxide, albeit at a much reduced rate, in the absence of the prime substrate (Myllyharju & Kivirikko, 1997). The uncoupled turnover process has been studied in detail in the case of prolyl-4-hydroxylase, where in the absence of collagen substrate the turnover of 2-oxoglutarate is apparently stoichiometric with that of ascorbate in the presence of excess of the latter (Myllyharju & Kivirikko, 1997). Some substrate analogues can stimulate the uncoupled turnover process without themselves being oxidized and certain mutations can signi®cantly alter the ratio of coupled : uncoupled turnover (Myllyharju & Kivirikko, 1997). The uncoupled turnover process may represent an editing process contributing to the attainment of both substrate and product (with respect to the type of oxidation reaction catalysed) selectivity by the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes. Conformational ¯exibility between (partially) open and closed enzyme forms may hinder binding and reaction of dioxygen to an enzymeFe(II)-2-oxoglutarate complex to which either the wrong ``prime'' substrate is bound or to one in which the correct prime substrate is incorrectly bound. Furthermore, such ¯exibility may also allow release of an undesirable or incorrectly bound prime substrate after formation of the ferryl species, which may be reduced back to the iron (II) oxidation state by a relatively non-speci®c reductant, e.g. ascorbate in the case of prolyl-4-hydroxylase{. The need for such an editing process may be particularly important in the case of prolyl-4{ The release of substrate after formation of the ferryl species offers a plausible explanation for kinetic studies measuring Vmax/Km isotope effects using deuterium labelled penicillin Ns (Baldwin et al., 1987a). These were interpreted previously as indicating a mechanism involving reversible binding of penicillin N (1) to a ferryl intermediate formed by reaction of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate with dioxygen. Note also that the possibility of more than one kinetic mechanism cannot be excluded.

Materials and Methods
Materials All chemicals were supplied by the Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., unless otherwise stated, and were of analytical grade or higher. Penicillin N (1) was synthesized by an extension of the reported method (Baldwin et al., 1987b). Chromatography systems and columns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein È puri®cation was performed on AKTA explorer1, FPLC1 or BioPilot System. Q-Sepharose1 HP (254 ml) was packed into a 60/100 column (I.D.  6 cm Â 9 cm). DEAE Sepharose1 FF (30 ml) was packed into aXK16 column (I.D.  1.6 cm Â 15 cm) or 250 ml into a XK50 column (I.D.  5.0 cm Â 12.7 cm). SOURCE1 151SO (33 ml) was packed into a FineLINE1 Pilot 35 column. Superdex1 75 was packed into an G32 Â 1000 column (Amicon, I.D.  3.2 cm Â 89 cm, 716 ml and a XK26 column (I.D.  2.6 cm Â 60 cm, 320 ml). The following prepacked columns were used: RESOURCE1 ISO (1 ml); RESOURCE1 Q (6 ml); Mono Q1 HR 16/10; Superdex1 200 10/30; NAP-5. SDS-PAGE was performed using the Mini-Protean system (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained using Coomassie brilliant blue and Bismark brown (Lloyd, 1996), and were calibrated with the molecular mass marker kit 12,300-78,000 (BDH). 1H NMR spectra were obtained in 2H2O and referenced to TSP. The anaerobic glove box was supplied by Belle Technology and was supplied with an atmosphere of oxygen-free nitrogen. Construction of expression vectors Expression vector pML1 was constructed according to standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989). Sub-cloning of the fragment of DNA containing the DAOCS gene was performed by digestion of pNM88 (Morgan et al., 1994) and pET 11a vectors using BamHI and NdeI. The appropriate fragments were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, ligated, transformed into Epicurian coli XL1 Blue (Stratagene) and plated onto LB-agar containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. Individual colonies were screened by agarose gel electrophoresis following initial digestion with BamHI/NdeI. The required clones were repuri®ed using the Wizard Mini-prep method (Promega), transformed by heat-shock into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) and plated as before. Single colonies were screened for expression in 2TY containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin at 27, 30, and 37 C. The DNA encoding the DAOCS gene was sub-cloned from pML1 into the pET24a vector using an analogous procedure with kanamycin sulphate

(50 mg/ml) as the selection antibiotic. This vector was designated pHL1. Fermentation of E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pML1 E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pML1 was inoculated from a glycerol freeze into 4 Â 100 ml of 2TY supplemented with 50 mg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 33  C. The starter culture was used to inoculate 30 l of the same medium supplemented with 5 ml of polypropylene glycol 2025 in a New Brunswick Scienti®c MPP40 fermenter. The culture was grown at 30  C, 300 r.p.m. and 30 l/min air for four hours (A600 nm  2.96). IPTG (0.4 mM, Melford) was added and the culture was grown for a further three hours under the same conditions. Cells were concentrated to ca three litres using a tangential ¯ow concentrator (Satorius) and centrifuged (JA-10 rotor, 10 000 r.p.m., 17,500 g, 15 minutes) and stored at À80  C. Cells containing pHL1 were grown under identical conditions using kanamycin sulphate (50 mg/ml) in place of ampicillin. Production of the selenomethionine derivative required re-optimization of the fermentation and puri®cation conditions. The methionine auxotrophes B834 (DE3) and B834 (LyS) (DE3) (Pappa et al., 1996) containing the pML1 plasmid gave soluble expression of DAOCS in 2TY medium, but soluble expression was not observed in LeMaster medium (by SDS-PAGE) and consequently E. coli BL21 (DE3) was used as the host cell. Small-scale incorporation trials showed that lower incorporation occurred for cultures induced at high A600, increasing post-induction growth times and decreasing selenomethionine concentrations (Figure 3). In the optimized procedure a single colony was inoculated into culture medium consisting of LeMaster media (Hendrickson et al., 1990) (5 ml), non-autoclavable LeMaster medium (0.5 ml), ampicillin (50 mg/ml), 1 Â Kao and Michayluk vitamin supplement (growth medium) supplemented with 2TY (0.5 ml) and DL-methionine (40 mg/ml) and grown at 37  C and 250 r.p.m. This culture was used to inoculate growth medium (2 Â 100 ml) supplemented with DL-methionine and grown as before. This culture was used to inoculate a ten litre fermenter containing growth medium and 50 mg/ml DL-selenomethionine and was grown at 37  C to A600  0.8, induced and allowed to grow for a further two hours before harvesting. Purification of DAOCS All manipulations were performed on ice or at 4  C. All fractions were analysed using 12.5 % (w/v) SDSPAGE, following initial TCA precipitation for those samples containing ammonium sulphate. Cells expressing wild-type DAOCS (E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pML1, 70.15 g) were thawed and resuspended in 280 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTT, 1 mM benzamidine-HCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM leupeptin (lysis buffer). Lysozyme (155 mg) was added and the solution was stirred for 15 minutes. Complete cell disruption was achieved by sonication using 4 Â 20 second burst on power 5 with 60 seconds cooling between each burst (W-380 sonicator, Ultrasonics Inc.). DNA was removed by precipitation with 1 % (w/v) streptomycin sulphate and 0.1 % (w/v) PEI. After 15 minutes stirring the extract was centrifuged (Beckman, JA-14 rotor, 12,000 r.p.m., 22,000 g, ten minutes), loaded onto a QSepharose1 HP column which had been equilibrated in

DAOCS Active Site 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTT, 0.2 mM benzamidine-HCl, 0.2 mM PMSF (column buffer) and washed with 1000 ml of the same buffer at 25 % ml/min. Protein was eluted with a 25-75 % 0.3 M NaCl gradient in the same buffer over 600 ml. All fractions (25 ml) were analysed by 12.5 % SDS-PAGE. Fractions 13-22 (150-220 mM NaCl) were pooled and 260 ml of 3.2 M (NH4)2SO4 was added slowly with stirring. This pool was loaded onto a SOURCE1 151SO column which had been equilibrated with 1.6 M (NH4)2SO4 in column buffer at 40 ml/min. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer and eluted with a 90-50 % gradient using column buffer supplemented with 20 % (v/v) glycerol over 300 ml with 20 ml fractions collected. The inclusion of glycerol in this buffer is essential for ef®cient elution of puri®ed protein. Fractions 3-7 (1.31.1 M (NH4)2SO4) were pooled, concentrated in a 50 ml Amicon stirred cell to ca 13 ml and loaded as 2 Â 6.5 ml onto a Superdex1 75 column (716 ml) which had been equilibrated in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTT, 0.2 mM benzamidine-HCl, 0.2 mM PMSF (gel ®ltration buffer). The column was eluted with the same buffer at 2 ml/min and fractions (5 ml) were collected between 280 and 440 ml. Fractions 18-32 (370440 ml and 49-62 (360-430 ml) were pooled, concentrated to ca 9 ml and exchanged into 10 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0) using Econo-pak columns (Bio-Rad). Protein was concentrated to 50 mg/ml and frozen on dry ice before storage at À80  C. It was not possible to measure accurately DAOCS activity in crude E. coli extracts, due to inference with the holed-plate assay (Baldwin et al., 1987a,b) by the antibiotic activity of streptomycin sulphate. Assay of DAOCS activity in crude extracts, by HPLC was also dif®cult because of the presence of other materials which absorb at l  254 nm. The molecular mass of native apo-DAOCS was determined by exchanging into gel ®ltration buffer and loading 0.38 mg (in 100 ml) onto a Superdex1 200 10/30 column which had been equilibrated in the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated using the following proteins (0.125 mg unless otherwise stated): bamylase (200 kDa); ADH (150 kDa); BSA (66 kDa); ovalbumin (42.7 kDa, 0.31 mg); carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). An identical analysis was also performed using 5 mM monopotassium 2-oxoglutarate in the buffer and sample. The expression level for the selenomethionyl-DAOCS was ca threefold less than for the wild-type, possibly due to the toxic effects of the selenomethionine and/or the relatively short induction time, and its puri®cation was performed in the presence of 5 mM DTT to avoid oxidative damage (Hendrickson et al., 1990). Two different ion-exchange column chromatographies (DEAE Sepharose1 FF and RESOURCE1 Q) at different pH values were required in order to improve the ®nal level of puri®cation. Thus, selenomethionyl-DAOCS was puri®ed from 22 g cells using an identical extraction procedure with 5 mM DTT. The extract was loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose1 FF column (30 ml) in column buffer at pH 8.5 and eluted with a 30-70 % 0.4 M NaCl gradient over 135 ml with 10 ml fractions. Further puri®cation of fractions 3-5 was achieved using ®ve runs with a RESOURCE1 ISO column (1 ml), eluting with a 90-35 % 1.6 M (NH4)2SO4 gradient over 12 ml at pH 7.5 with 1 ml fractions. Fractions 2-6 were pooled and concentrated to 6 ml, loaded as 2 Â 3 ml onto a Superdex1 75 column (320 ml) and puri®ed as before with 3 ml fractions. Fractions 20-28 and 70-78 were pooled, diluted with one volume of Milli-Q water and loaded onto a RESOURCE1 Q column (6 ml) in column buffer at

DAOCS Active Site pH 7.5. The column was eluted with a 25-75 % 0.3 M NaCl gradient over 27 ml with 3 ml fractions. Fractions 3-5 were pooled, buffer exchanged and concentrated to 26.4 mg/ml before storage at À80  C. The derivative was ca 95 % (i.e. less than the wild-type) pure by SDS-PAGE analysis and had a similar speci®c activity to wild-type DAOCS using penicillin N (1) as substrate in the holed plate assay (232 nmol/min per mg compared to 208 nmol/min per mg for wild-type DAOCS control). Synthesis of G-7-ADCA (11) (11) was prepared from 7-ADCA (5.1 mmol, 1.02 g) and phenylacetyl chloride (7.56 mmol, 1 ml) (Chauvette et al., 1971) using THF as the organic solvent and NaOH as the base. The product was solvent extracted into ethyl acetate to give a pale yellow solid (475 mg, 26 %). HPLC puri®cation (C4 Hypersil (250 Â 4.6 mm), 25 mM NH4HCO3 in 5 % (v/v) methanol at 2 ml/min, l  254 nm) gave (11) (>95 % pure by 1H NMR analysis) with a retention volume of 34-42.8 ml: 1H NMR (500 MHz) dH 1.9 (3 H, s, CH3); 3.25 (1 H, d, J  7.5 Hz, H-4); 3.35 (3 H, s, residual MeOH); 3.55 (1 H, d, J  7.5 Hz, H-4); 3.70 (2 H, ABq, J  16 Hz, PhCH2-); 5.05 (1 H, d, J  5.5 Hz, H-6); 5.60 (1 H, d, J  5.5 Hz, H-7); m/z (negative ESI MS)  331 (M-H). Incubation of penicillin G (10) DAOCS (6.14 mg, 119 units/mg, 730 units) and penicillin G (10, 7.56 mg, 20 mmol) were incubated in a ®nal volume of 2 ml (Shibata et al., 1996) for two hours. The reaction was quenched with 5 ml of acetone, which was removed in vacuo before freeze-drying. 1H NMR (500 MHz) analyses implied a ca 20-30 % conversion of penicillin G (10) to G-7-ADCA (11), as judged by integration of the resonance at 5.60 p.p.m. against TSP. Puri®cation of the crude incubation mixture by HPLC (as above with 10 % (v/v) methanol in the eluent) gave G-7-ADCA (11) (45 mg) with a retention volume of 23.2-26.4 ml. 1H NMR and ESI MS analyses were the same as those reported above for synthetic (11). Kinetic assays Protein (10 ml) was mixed with 10 ml of 10 Â stock solution of cofactors (500 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM 2-oxoglutarate, 20 mM DTT, 10 nM ascorbate, 20 mM FeSO4, NaOH to pH 7.5 in 50 mM Tris-HCl, p 7.5) and incubated at ambient temperature for two minutes. The mixture was diluted with 70 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and the reaction initiated by addition of 1.0 mM penicillin N (1, 10 ml). After 5 minutes methanol (100 ml) was added and 50 or 100 ml was used to measure the DAOC present using the holed-plate method with E. coli ESS as the indicator organism (Baldwin et al., 1987a,b). Plates were calibrated using DAOC (0.5-1.0 nmol). Alternatively, DAOC (2) was quanti®ed using anion-exchange HPLC (Morgan et al., 1994; Shibata et al., 1996). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (1976) using BSA as a calibration standard. Kinetic parameters for penicillin G (10) were determined with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 mM substrate using 18.8 mg DAOCS/assay in a total volume of 200 ml. After quenching the reaction with 200 ml methanol, 200 ml of water was added. Samples were centrifuged and analysed by HPLC (150 ml injections, as above using 15 % (v/v) methanol in the eluent). Product was quanti®ed by

957
peak height at 0.05 AUFS using synthetic G-7-ADCA (11, 0.5-3.5 nmol) as standard. Kinetic parameters (ÆSE) were determined using Leonora by directly ®tting of the data to the appropriate kinetic expression following initial graphical analysis. Preliminary experiments with metal ions used the HPLC assay with penicillin N (1) as substrate. Enzyme was preincubated for two minutes with cofactors with the appropriate metal ion at 2 mM ®nal concentration replacing Fe(II). Analysis of metal ions as potential inhibitors was performed by the same method using the standard cofactor mixture with Fe(II). UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Phillips PyeUnicam 8800 UV-visible spectrophotometer in 10 mM Na2HPO4-HCl (pH 7.0). DTNB titration of DAOCS DAOCS (ca 1 mg) in 200 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl(pH 7.5) was incubated on ice with 2.5 mM DTT for two hours 15 minutes. The sample was diluted to 500 ml and exchanged into 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with a NAP-5 column. The sample was diluted to 4 ml and 0.7 ml was assayed at A412 (Habeeb, 1974) in the presence or absence of 2 % SDS (w/v) with 1 mM DTNB. Dynamic laser light scattering Dynamic laser light scattering measurements were performed in a DynaPro-801 TC instrument at 8-37  C using DAOCS (1 mg/ml) in 10 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0) Samples containing iron(II) were prepared and measured under anaerobic conditions. Preparation and analysis of EXAFS samples A crude extract of E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pML1 was prepared and puri®ed by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE Sepharose1 FF and gel ®ltration chromatography as described above. Final puri®cation was achieved with Mono Q1 16/10 column chromatography using a 0-0.4 M NaCl gradient over 13 ml. Puri®ed DAOCS were exchanged into 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.3 mM (NaN3 (pH 7.5) and concentrated to 74 mg/ml (ca 2.15 mM). Iron(II) sulphate (100 mM, 5 ml) or FeSO4 and potassium 2-oxoglutarate (200 mM, 2.5 ml) were added to 250 ml of enzyme under anaerobic conditions and frozen in liquid nitrogen in the EXAFS cell. The EXAFS data (Randall et al., 1993) were recorded at ca 80 K on station 8.1 of the CCLRC Daresbury SRS, operated at 2 GeV with an average current of 150 mA, using a liquid nitrogen-cooled cold ®nger. Twelve scans were recorded and averaged for each sample. The Fe K-edge spectra were calibrated relative to the ®rst peak in the derivative for an iron foil Spectrum at 7112 eV. Spectra were analysed, including multiple scattering, in EXCURV92 (Binsted et al., 1991) using exact wave theory (Lee & Pendry, 1975; Gurman et al., 1984, 1986). Phase shifts were calculated ab initio using Hedin-Lundqvist potentials (Hedin & Lundqvist, 1969). Theoretical ®ts were generated by adding shells of scatterers around the central iron atom and iterating the bond lengths and Debye-Waller type parameters to achieve the optimum ®t to the experimental data. To reduce the number of parameters used to interpret the EXAFS, the occupation number of each shell of backscattering atoms was ®xed at an integer value and a restrained re®nement approach (Binsted et al., 1992) used to treat the backscattering of

958
the imidazole rings of the histidine ligands. Thus, these groups were each treated as single units constrained at the known geometry, including multiple scattering pathways and keeping Debye-Waller parameters the same for atoms at similar distances from the metal (Binsted et al., 1992). Backscattering from the 2-oxoglutarate group was similarly treated by restrained re®nement using the geometry previously determined for sodium 2-oxoglutarate (Lis & Matuszewski, 1984). Crystallization of DAOCS Crystals of DAOCS were grown by vapour-diffusion using the hanging drop method at ca 20  C. The precipitating solution consisted of 100 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM potassium 2-oxoglutarate and 1.6-1.7 M (NH4)2SO4. Drops (3 ml) consisted of 55 mM HepesNaOH (pH 7.0), 2.5 mM potassium 2-oxoglutarate and 0.8-0.85 M (NH4)2SO4. Selenomethionyl-DAOCS could only be crystallized under these conditions in the anaerobic glove box with dioxygen levels maintained at 0.1-0.3 p.p.m. throughout. These crystals were used to deterÊ mine the structure of DAOCS (Valegard et al., 1998) using isomorphous replacement and a detwinning strategy (A.C. Terwisscha van Scheltinga et al., unpublished results). An independent structure of the DAOCS, 2-oxoÊ glutarate complex was also determined to 2.5 A by isomorphous replacement (K. Harlos & M. D. Lloyd, unpublished results). Both structures were used during the analysis of the DAOCS reaction mechanism.

Large two-dimensional crystals of H-ATPase, a 100 kDa integral membrane protein, were grown directly onto the carbon surface of an electron microscope grid. This procedure prevented the fragmentation that is normally observed upon transfer of the crystals from the air-water interface to a continuous carbon support ®lm. Crystals grown by this method Ê measure $5 mm across and have a thickness of $240 A. They are of better quality than the monolayers previously obtained at the air-water Ê interface, yielding structure factors to at least 8 A in-plane resolution by electron image processing. Unlike most other two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins they do not contain a lipid bilayer, but consist of detergent-protein micelles of H-ATPase hexamers tightly packed on a trigonal lattice. The crystals belong to the two-sided plane group p321 Ê (a  b  165 A), containing two layers of hexamers related by an in-plane axis of 2-fold symmetry. The protein is in contact with the carbon surface through its large, hydrophilic 70 kDa cytoplasmic portion, yet due to the presence of detergent in the crystallizing buffer, the hydrophobicity of the carbon surface does not appear to affect crystal formation. Surface crystallisation may be a useful method for other proteins which form fragile two-dimensional crystals, in particular if conditions for obtaining three-dimensional crystals are known, but their quality or stability is insuf®cient for X-ray structure determination.

Introduction
In recent years, electron microscopy of twodimensional (2D) crystals has developed into a viable alternative to X-ray crystallography for determining the structure of large biological macromolecules that do not yield highly ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals. This is often the case with membrane proteins, and for this reason electron microscopy has been particularly successful as a tool in membrane biology. To date, atomic models of two membrane proteins have been derived by electron crystallography: bacteriorhodopsin (Henderson et al., 1990) and the plant lightÈ harvesting complex LHC II (Kuhlbrandt et al.,

1994). Several other membrane protein structures Ê determined at intermediate resolution (6-9 A) have revealed the arrangement of membrane-spanning a-helices: these include aquaporin (Cheng et al., Ê 1997; Walz et al., 1997; Li et al., 1997) at 6 A, rhodopsin (Unger et al., 1997), Ca2-ATPase (Zhang et al., 1998a) and H-ATPase (Auer et al., 1998) at Ê Ê 8 A, and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at 9 A resolution (Unwin, 1995). With the exception of the H-ATPase which is discussed here, all these 3D structures were determined from sheet-like or tubular 2D crystals in which the membrane protein is embedded in a lipid bilayer. A few membrane proteins naturally form 2D crystals (bacteriorhodopsin, gap junctions), but some can be induced to crystallise in situ by rearrangement in the lipid bilayer of isolated membranes (acetylcholine receptor, rhodopsin, Ca2-ATPase). A widely used procedure for generating 2D crystals is the reconstitution of the puri®ed, detergent-solubilised membrane protein

962 into lipid sheets or vesicles (for a review, see È Kuhlbrandt, 1992). Detergent is removed either by È dialysis (Kuhlbrandt, 1992; Jap et al., 1992) or by absorption to BioBeads (Rigaud et al., 1997). This approach has yielded highly ordered 2D crystals of membrane proteins which do not have large extramembraneous domains and which therefore rely mainly on hydrophobic protein-protein or lipidprotein interactions in the lipid bilayer, such as LHC-II, bacteriorhodopsin, and aquaporin. Membrane proteins with large hydrophilic domains tend to form 3D crystals more readily due to the potential of the extramembrane portions for hydrophilic crystal contacts. A number of 3D membrane protein crystals have yielded structures at nearatomic resolution by X-ray crystallography (Deisenhofer et al., 1984; Weiss et al., 1991; Cowan et al., 1992; Iwata et al., 1995; Tsukihara et al., 1995; McDermott et al., 1995; Koepke et al., 1996; Song et al., 1996; Yu et al., 1997; Pebay-Peroula et al., 1997; Doyle et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1998b). Unfortunately it is not unusual for 3D crystals of membrane proteins to be poorly ordered, or too small for X-ray diffraction. For electron crystallography on the other hand, small crystalline arrays of less than 1 mm are, in principle, suf®cient for a 3D structure determination at high resolution (Henderson, 1995), provided that the crystals are thin enough, and ideally form monolayers. Electron image processing can correct small crystal distortions and is therefore uniquely able to extract useful structural information from imperfect crystals having long-range disorder (Henderson et al., 1986). We have used electron microscopy to study the integral membrane protein H-ATPase from the Neurospora crassa plasma membrane. Drops of solution for growing 3D crystals diffracting Ê X-rays to $9 A resolution (Scarborough, 1994) were found to produce crystalline monolayers of protein hexamers at the air-water interface (Cyrklaff et al., 1995). Such 2D crystals grown in or transferred to the holes of a holey carbon ®lm yielded a projected structure of the H-ATPase Ê hexamer at 10.3 A resolution (Cyrklaff et al., 1995). However, in order to obtain a 3D density map from tilted samples, it was necessary to transfer these crystals onto a continuous carbon support ®lm, to avoid problems of crystal curvature and specimen charging. These effects made it dif®cult to collect good images of unsupported 2D crystals for structure determination, especially at large tilt angles. Here, we describe a method by which 2D crystals of the H-ATPase suitable for 3D structure determination by electron crystallography are grown directly on the carbon ®lm of a support grid. By this method, the problems mentioned above are at least partially overcome. This has enabled us to determine the 3D structure of the Ê N. crassa plasma membrane H-ATPase at 8 A resolution (Auer et al., 1998).

Surface Crystallisation on a Carbon Support Film

Results
The crystalline sheets of H-ATPase hexamers forming at the air-water interface of crystallisation drops (Cyrklaff et al., 1995) seemed highly promising for the determination of the 3D structure of this important ion pump by electron microscopy and image processing. However, the sheets were extremely fragile which made it dif®cult to transfer them onto a continuous carbon support ®lm, an important prerequisite for 3D data collection. The transfer often resulted in complete disruption of the crystal into small fragments as a result of surface forces (Figure 1). In addition, the crystals tended to stack, apparently forming thin 3D crystals, which were dif®cult to distinguish from true 2D crystals in unsupported, frozen-hydrated specimens. By growing the crystals directly on the carbon ®lm surface, we were able to overcome both problems. Preliminary experiments with holey carbon ®lms incubated on crystallisation drops had shown that 2D crystals forming in the holes occasionally extended onto the carbon ®lm. Initial crystallisation trials in which droplets were incubated on continuous carbon ®lm for several hours resulted in mosaics of small crystalline arrays which were visible in negative stain. A pre-evaporation step of leaving the droplet to evaporate in air at 4  C for ten minutes before placing the grid on it, followed by incubation in the sealed well of a Linbro plate for eight to 12 hours, resulted in the formation of large crystals ($15-20 mm). These were mostly stepped multilayers (Figure 2). The length of the steps indicated that in-plane crystal growth was faster than in the perpendicular direction. By varying conditions between these two extremes it was possible to devise a procedure which reproducibly yielded suf®ciently large 2D crystals with a thick-

ness of one unit cell. The formation of multilayers was avoided almost completely by omitting the ten minute pre-evaporation step, apparently due to the presence of fewer nucleation sites and slower crystal growth. The ®nal size of the crystals was strongly time-dependent. As expected, shorter incubation times yielded smaller crystals, whereas longer incubation periods produced crystals of up to $ 10 mm size, but increased the risk of multilayer formation. With the protein preparation used for most of the experiments, an incubation time of ca two hours proved to be optimal, yielding large numbers of single crystals of a characteristic triangular shape that grew routinely to a size of $5 mm (Figure 3). Upon variation of the crystallisation conditions we observed that crystals could also be obtained with lower concentrations of ammonium sulphate, e.g. 50 mM, but not with 25 mM or 5 mM. The 2D crystals grew at concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 between 8 % and 12 %, but not 4 % (10.5 % was optimal) as well as with 10.5 % PEG 8000 instead of PEG 4000, but not with 10.5 % PEG 400 or PEG 1000. At higher detergent concentrations ($10 mg/ml instead of 1.28 mg/ml), 2D crystal formation was not observed. An increase of the temperature during crystallisation from 4  C to 20  C resulted in 2D crystals that curled at the edges, and when obtained at the air-water inter-

face, the crystals even rolled into tubes which were open at both ends, which distinguished them from tubular crystals of membrane proteins in lipid bilayers. It is interesting to note that 2D crystals were also found at protein concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/ml under otherwise similar crystallisation conditions. The thickness of the electron microscope grid was an important factor in¯uencing the number of crystals found on a grid. In this respect, the use of gold-coated copper electron microscope grids proved to be an advantage as they are thinner than conventional grids and thus facilitate the contact between the carbon ®lm and the drop surface. The hydrophobicity of the carbon surface did not appear to affect crystal formation, as 2D crystals grew equally well on carbon ®lms rendered hydrophobic by baking and on ®lms that had been made hydrophilic by glow-discharging in air or amylamine (results not shown). This was probably due to the presence of detergent in the crystallisation solution which should cover the carbon surface and neutralise any differences in hydrophobicity. Micrographs of 2D crystals routinely yielded difÊ fraction spots to 8 A in-plane resolution after correction for lattice distortions. Figure 4 shows the Fourier transform of one such image in which Ê some re¯ections are visible to $6 A. Surprisingly, phase comparison of symmetry-related re¯ections did not indicate p6 symmetry as in the case of the single-layer sheets that formed at the air-water interface (Cyrklaff et al., 1995). Instead, some images of 2D crystals grown on carbon ®lm

showed p321 symmetry, with phase residuals of 20-25  (90  is random). In many others, the symmetry was less obvious, although it was unusually close to p321. This meant that the crystals grown on the carbon ®lm were not single layers of HATPase hexamers, but consisted of at least two such layers. We therefore combined two p6 layers from our earlier projection map (Cyrklaff et al., 1995) into a p321 projection and compared this with the experimentally determined projection map of a carbon surface-grown crystal. The close agreement between the two maps suggested that at least those substrate-grown crystals that showed clear p321 symmetry were composed of two layers of hexamers, related by an in-plane 2-fold axis (data not shown). This presented three likely explanations for the imperfect p321 symmetry observed in a substantial fraction of the images: either it was due to a

small lateral shift of one layer from the p321 symmetry-related position, or to the presence of additional layers breaking the p321 symmetry, or to a small tilt of the crystal resulting in an apparent loss of the p321 projection symmetry. The comparison of each of these images to a combined set of amplitudes and phases used for calculating the 3D map of the H-ATPase (Auer et al., 1998) indicated that the deviations were due to small crystal tilts, in the range of $3  to 7  , even though the grid was nominally untilted. When these tilt angles were taken into account, the phases from images without clear p321 projection symmetry merged readily into the data set, resulting in phase residuals of 20  to 30  (90  being random). With most 2D crystals, such small tilts would not result in an obvious deviation from the projection symmetry. Due to the Ê unusual thickness ($240 A) of the H-ATPase 2D

965 increase in the concentration of hexamers on the drop surface which is more rapid in the absence of the carbon ®lm, or of the kinetics of crystal formation, as diffusion on the air-water interface is likely to be faster than on the surface of a solid substrate, even with detergent present. Crystalline monolayers were always less well ordered than the double layers grown at the air-water interface. They were also quite rare and dif®cult to distinguish from double-layered crystals, except by image processing, and therefore much less suitable for 3D data collection. It is worth noting that some images of 2D crystals at the air-water interface also showed p321 projection symmetry, indicating that they were double layers. The three-dimensional density map (Auer et al., 1998) revealed that the two layers are in contact via their small extracellular portion, with the large hydrophilic parts of this highly asymmetric membrane protein facing the carbon surface and the solution, respectively. The contact to the carbon surface therefore seems to be mediated by hydrophilic forces, as in the formation of 2D crystals of soluble proteins on lipid monolayers. The crystals have perfect p321 symmetry, at least to the resolution to which they diffract, as indicated by the Ê real phases of axial re¯ections in the 8 A 3D data set (Auer et al., 1998). This means that the two layers have the same structure and that the conformation of the protein is not altered by contact with the substrate. The formation of double-layered H-ATPase 2D crystals can be thought to occur in three stages (Figure 5). Initially, the protein molecules diffuse freely in solution and adsorb to the carbon ®lm. The rate of adsorption of the molecules onto the carbon surface is higher than the rate of desorption, as the hexamers clearly accumulate at the interface. The hexamers then apparently diffuse along the carbon surface and accumulate into a close-packed array. This ®rst single protein layer was found to be non-crystalline, as images taken from such areas indicated poor, if any, order in the Fourier transform. With the formation of a second layer, large crystalline arrays were found, suggesting that the second layer assists in the ordering of the ®rst. As judged by image processing, any additional layers were equally well ordered. Crystallisation on the carbon ®lm was more reproducible and easier to control than on the air-water interface. As the reproducibility of crystallisation experiments often depends on stable crystal nuclei, the carbon ®lm seems to have a favourable effect in protecting the nuclei from disintegrating, as well as providing an interface at which molecules accumulate and rearrange. The proposed mechanism of crystal formation is consistent with an estimate of the mass thickness of multilayer crystals obtained by low-temperature scanning transmission electron microscopy. These measurements indicated roughly equal mass increments per step from the second layer onwards.

crystals, however, the amplitudes and phases of Fourier components vary rapidly in z* direction, causing an apparent breakdown of the projection symmetry at tilt angles of less than 10  . Interestingly, the carbon ®lm in the vicinity of a crystal was covered with a monolayer of closely packed H-ATPase hexamers. These were visible in negative stain, and by cryomicroscopy as a characteristic pattern of gas bubbles produced by radiation damage. Surprisingly, this surrounding layer did not appear to be crystalline, as optical diffraction of electron micrographs of such areas indicated little, if any order. In contrast, the single layers that had occasionally been found at the airwater interface were clearly crystalline and difÊ fracted to $12 A (Cyrklaff et al., 1995).

Discussion
Because the protein preparation contains little, if any, lipid (Chadwick et al., 1987; G.A.S., unpublished results) and no lipid was added to the crystallisation mixture, there can be no lipid bilayer in the surface crystals of the H-ATPase. The 2D crystals are clearly not held together by hydrophobic interactions between lipids and proteins which stabilise 2D crystals of most other membrane proteins, and are therefore likely to be arrays of detergent-protein mixed micelles. This was con®rmed by the 3D structure of the plasma membrane HÊ ATPase at 8 A resolution which revealed that the crystals consisted of tightly packed ATPase hexamers, each surrounded by a toroidal micelle of the detergent dodecyl-b-D-maltoside. The absence of a lipid bilayer explains why the crystals are so susceptible to disruption by the interfacial forces which occur when they are transferred onto electron microscope grids. Growing the crystals on the carbon ®lm surface was essential for collecting a 3D data set, as it avoided the fragmentation of the crystals and minimized beam-induced movement. The experimental design resembles a conventional hanging drop vapour diffusion experiment, except that a carboncoated electron microscope grid covers the drop surface. We used conditions which had reproducibly yielded 3D crystals of the H-ATPase (Scarborough, 1994). The resulting 2D crystals were harvested after a few hours, as longer incubation times resulted in the formation of multilayers which are dif®cult to deal with in electron crystallography. The double-layered 2D crystals of the ATPase obtained by surface crystallisation were larger and more highly ordered than the single crystals obtained at the air-water interface. This probably re¯ects the increased mechanical strength provided by the carbon support ®lm. Surprisingly, we never found well-ordered single-layered crystals with p6 symmetry growing on the carbon ®lms, whereas such crystals seemed to form readily at the airwater interface. This may be an effect of a local

(b) Upon adhesion to the surface, the protein hexamers diffuse along the surface into a close packed, non-crystalline array.

Ê well ordered for structural studies at 6-12 A resolution. The technique of lipid monolayer crystallisation seems to be unsuitable for membrane proteins, however, as the detergent which is necessary to solubilise the protein would disrupt the lipid monolayer. The 2D crystals described here are fundamentally different from other 2D crystals of membrane proteins grown by lipid reconstitution and detergent removal, and can be considered as 3D crystals consisting of detergent-protein complexes (Michel, 1982) with a thickness of a single unit cell. Surface crystallisation on a carbon support ®lm resembles the epitaxial growth of 3D crystals on heterologous surfaces, which has been used to crystallise bacteriorhodopsin on benzamidine crystals (Schertler et al., 1993). Unlike 3D crystallisation, however, the formation of 2D crystals is very quick and economical: once crystallisation conditions were established, each experiment required only $7 mg of protein, most of which could be recovered if necessary, and the result could be assessed by electron microscopy within one to two hours. We hope that surface crystallisation will provide a way to grow 2D crystals for structure determination by electron microscopy for soluble or membrane proteins that can only be obtained in small quantities, especially if 3D crystals can be obtained but their quality or stability is insuf®cient for high-resolution structure determination by X-ray crystallography.

Methods
Two-dimensional crystals The 2D crystals were grown on carbon ®lms, supported on thin, gold-plated copper 400 mesh electron microscope grids (Plano) from a solution containing the 1 mg/ml H-ATPase, 1.28 mg/ml dodecymaltoside, 0.1 % (w/v) trehalose, 100 mM ammonium sulphate and 10.5 % (w/v) PEG 4000 (Fluka) in a solution containing 30 % (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 2 mg/ml chymostatin, with the pH being adjusted to 6.8 with Tris (Cyrklaff et al., 1995). Gold-plated grids were used to avoid corrosion of standard Cu grids in contact with the crystallising solution. Carbon-coated grids were heated to 160  C for one hour prior to the experiment in order to improve the mechanical stability of the carbon ®lm as well as its adhesion to the supporting grid. In a typical crystallisation experiment, a 7 ml drop of the crystallising solution was placed on a siliconised coverslip. The grid was immediately placed onto the drop with the grid bars facing the solution, taking care not to trap air bubbles. The coverslip was inverted onto the well of a Linbro tissue culture plate containing 1 ml of water, sealed with immersion oil (Sigma) and left at 4  C for one to four hours. Specimen preparation and electron microscopy Grids were picked up from the surface of the drops, blotted for ®ve to ten seconds with two to four layers of ®lter paper (Whatman No. 4) and frozen in liquid ethane (Dubochet et al., 1988). The blotting and freezing pro-

The ®rst step, which from image processing is known to be poorly ordered, had a larger mass density than the others, as might be expected of a single layer of hexamers plus a carbon ®lm. As the thickness of each step and of the carbon ®lm is, however, not known in absolute terms, it cannot be ruled out that the 3D crystals form by epitaxial growth in steps of well-ordered double layers on top of a disordered single layer. Surface-assisted crystallisation has been used in the past to generate 2D crystals of a variety of soluble proteins. Crystalline arrays of F1ATPase and ferritin formed at a liquid-liquid interface (Yoshimura et al., 1990; Aoyama et al., 1995), alcohol oxidase was crystallised on carbon-coated formvar ®lm (Vonck & van Bruggen, 1990) and chloroplast F1-ATPase formed 2D crystals on carbon-coated grids (Boekema & È Bottcher, 1992). Various protein assemblies, including the 50 S ribosome, RNA polymerase, and cholera toxin, form extensive 2D crystals on lipid monolayers (see the review by Kornberg & Darst, 1991), and some of these were suf®ciently

Surface Crystallisation on a Carbon Support Film cedure was critical because insuf®cient blotting left an undesirably thick ®lm of viscous buffer, whereas excessive blotting resulted in drying and loss of crystal order. The frozen grid was transferred at liquid-nitrogen temperature into a Gatan cryotransfer specimen holder and observed at $100 K in a Philips CM200 FEG or in a JEOL 2000 EX electron microscope operated at 200 kV acceleration voltage. Crystals were located either in defocused diffraction mode (JEOL 2000 EX) or at a magni®cation of 1500 and high defocus (Philips CM200 FEG). Images for structure determination were recorded at low-dose conditions in a Philips CM200 FEG at a magni®cation of 50,000 on Kodak SO-163 ®lm and developed for 12 minutes with full-strength Kodak D19. Image processing Micrographs were screened by optical diffraction. Areas of 8000 Â 8000 pixels were digitised using a Zeiss SCAI scanner with a step size of 7 mm. Images were processed on a DEC/Alpha workstation using the MRC image processing programs (Crowther et al., 1996). Phase comparison of symmetry-related re¯ections using the program ALLSPACE (Crowther et al., 1996) indicated p321 symmetry for crystals with tilt angles of less than Ê 5  , due to their large thickness of $240 A (Auer et al., 1998). After two cycles of unbending (Henderson et al., 1986) and correction for the contrast transfer function, a list of amplitudes and phases of structure factors was obtained, and a projection map was calculated with CCP4 software (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, 1994). The model projection structure of a doublelayered p321 crystal was calculated from the previously obtained projection p6 of crystalline monolayers (Cyrklaff et al., 1995) using the package EM (Hegerl, 1996).
