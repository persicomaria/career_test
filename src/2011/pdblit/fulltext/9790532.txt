Mammalian GEFs are divided into several subfamilies that have very different amino acid sequences. Each GEF subfamily catalyzes nucleotide exchange for a specific subset of GTPases. For example, Sos, Cdc25, Sdc25, and Ras guanine nucleotide release factor (GRF) are exchange factors for Ras, whereas other GEFs catalyze nucleotide exchange for Arf and Rab. Another subset of GEFs catalyze nucleotide exchange for the Rho family of small GTPases that are responsible for regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements in many cell types (Hart et al., 1991; Cerione and Zheng, 1996; Whitehead et al., 1997). These GEFs have been implicated in malignant transformation and have been shown to induce transformed foci when expressed in fibroblasts (Hart et al., 1994; Horii et al., 1994; Whitehead et al., 1995a, 1995b, 1996; Zheng et al., 1995). One member of the Rho GEF family, called Trio, contains two GEFs. The N-terminal GEF specifically catalyzes nucleotide exchange for Rac1, leading to the activation of Jun kinase and the production of membrane ruffles. The other GEF domain of Trio is an exchange factor for RhoA and induces the formation of stress fibers (Debant et al., 1996; Bellanger et al., 1998). All members of the Rho GEF family contain a Dbl homology (DH) domain of about 180 amino acids, which is the catalytically active region of the protein (Whitehead et al., 1997). The amino acid sequences of DH domains are very different compared to the other GEFs but are well conserved among family members, especially for three regions of the protein (Whitehead et al., 1997). DHcontaining proteins also invariably contain an adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Rebecchi and Scarlata, 1998) whose function is unknown. Unlike the exchange factors for Ras (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998), Arf (Betz et al., 1998; Cherfils et al., 1998; Mossessova et al., 1998), and Rab (Yu and Schreiber, 1995), threedimensional structures for Rho GEFs have not been reported. Here we describe the solution structure of the N-terminal Dbl homology domain of Trio. From the structure and site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified residues that are critical for catalyzing nucleotide exchange. In addition, we have discovered an unexpected role of the PH domain in aiding nucleotide exchange. Results and Discussion Structure Determination A portion of Trio encompassing the N-terminal Dbl homology domain (residues 1227­1407) (Figure 1) was overexpressed in E. coli, isotopically labeled, and purified. The recombinant protein contained an extra methionine at the N terminus and a histidine tag at the C terminus to facilitate purification. The two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of the 15N-labeled DH domain was indicative of a folded protein. The backbone and side chain resonances of the protein were assigned from standard heteronuclear three-dimensional NMR experiments (see

Summary Guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho family of GTPases contain a Dbl homology (DH) domain responsible for catalysis and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain whose function is unknown. Here we describe the solution structure of the N-terminal DH domain of Trio that catalyzes nucleotide exchange for Rac1. The all- -helical protein has a very different structure compared to other exchange factors. Based on site-directed mutagenesis, functionally important residues of the DH domain were identified. They are all highly conserved and reside in close proximity on two helices. In addition, we have discovered a unique capability of the PH domain to enhance nucleotide exchange in DH domain­containing proteins. Introduction GTPases act as molecular switches for many cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, vesicle-mediated transport, and cytoskeletal organization (Bourne et al., 1991). The family of small mammalian GTPases contains over 60 members that all share a common fold. They are classified into subfamilies that include Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran based on their different functions and amino acid sequence (Boguski and McCormick, 1993). Regulation of the GTPases is mediated by two classes of enzymes. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, leading to the inactive state, whereas guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) catalyze the release of GDP, leading to the formation of the active GTP-bound state (Boguski and McCormick, 1993). Recent structural studies of GAP catalytic domains complexed to small GTPases (Rittinger et al., 1997; Scheffzek et al., 1997) have led to new insights on the mechanism of GTPase activation. Similarly, crystal structures of GEFs complexed to their cognate GTPases (Kawashima et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997b; BoriackSjodin et al., 1998) have shown how GEFs disrupt both

Experimental Procedures). To assign the side chains of the phenylalanines and the 13C/1H methyl resonances of the leucines and valines, NMR spectra were recorded on a 15N, 13C, and 2H protein containing protonated phenylalanines 13C-labeled at the position and [15N,13C,2H] leucines and valines selectively protonated at the methyl groups (Gardner and Kay, 1997). In addition to aiding in the assignment process, this protein sample was useful for rapidly identifying long-range NOEs between hydrophobic residues of the core, which was helpful in obtaining the initial protein fold. The structure of the N-terminal DH domain of Trio was determined from a total of 1950 NMR-derived distance and torsional angle restraints (Table 1). In addition, 66 angular restraints were included in the structure calculations that were derived from 15N­1H residual dipolar couplings measured for the DH domain oriented with respect to the static magnetic field in a 5% solution of dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC)/3-(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio-2-hydroxyl-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPSO) at a molar ratio of 4.2:1 (Wang et al., 1998). Figure 2A depicts the backbone (N, C , C ) of 15 lowenergy structures that were derived from the NMR data. The atomic rms deviation about the mean coordinate ° position for residues 1234­1402 is 1.0 0.1 A for the ° backbone atoms and 1.5 0.2 A for all heavy atoms. The N-terminal residues 1227­1233 and the C-terminal residues 1403­1407 are disordered. Due to the lack of resonance assignments, the side chains of E1287, E1299, and K1372 are also ill-defined in the ensemble of three-dimensional structures. Structure Description As predicted (Whitehead et al., 1997), the Dbl homology domain is an all- -helical protein. It is an elongated

° molecule with an overall length of about 70 A and a ° width of 40 A. In the orientations shown in Figures 2B and 2C, the top of the protein resembles an antiparallel five-helix bundle. However, based upon a similarity search using the Deja Vu program (Kleywegt and Jones, 1995), the structure of the DH domain is unique. The first helix of the DH domain begins at K1235 and nearly spans the length of the protein. It has an irregularity at T1258, as evidenced by the large 3JNH,H coupling constant and the upfield C chemical shift of this residue. 2, 3, and 4 run in the opposite direction to 1. The short breaks between 2/ 3 and 3/ 4 are supported by a number of spectral features, including relatively large 3JNH,H coupling constants, rapid amide exchange rates, and a break in the characteristic NOE patterns for helices. The helices 5 and 6 are oriented antiparallel to 3 and 4. A bend occurs between 3 and 4 that is mimicked by the bend observed between 5 and 6. 7 and 8 pack against 1, 2, and the loop connecting helices 1 and 2. Helix 8 is followed by a loop that has some helical character, 9, a disordered nineresidue loop, and the C-terminal helix 10. There are several hydrophobic residues that are conserved in DH domains (Figure 1) (Whitehead et al., 1997). The side chains for most of these residues point to the interior of the protein and compose the hydrophobic core of the N-terminal DH domain of Trio. An exception is L1375. This residue is highly conserved and completely exposed to solvent. Although the side chains of hydrophobic residues such as F1236, L1260, and L1279 are also exposed to solvent, they are not conserved within DH domains (Figure 1). Interestingly, the side chains of a few highly conserved hydrophilic residues (e.g., E1245 and R1369) are located in the interior portion of the DH domain. Inspection of the ensemble of NMRderived structures shows that the side chains of these

SA is the ensemble of 15 NMR-derived solution structures for the

DH domain (residues 1227­1407); SA is the mean atomic structure obtained by averaging the individual SA structures following a least squares superposition of the backbone heavy atoms for residues 1234­1402; and SA r is the energy minimized average structure. The CNS Frepel function was used to simulate van der Waals interac° tions with a force constant of 4.0 kcal mol 1 A 4 with atomic radii set to 0.8 their CHARMM values (Brooks et al., 1993). b Distance restraints were employed with a square-well potential ° (Fnoe 50 kcal mol 1 A 2). Hydrogen bonds were included as dis° ° tance restraints and given bounds of 1.8­2.5 A (H­O) and 2.5­3.5 A (N­O). Medium-range NOEs are observed between protons separated by more than one and less than five residues in the primary sequence. Long-range NOEs are observed between protons separated by five or more residues. A total of 1722 nontrivial NOE-derived distance restraints were employed. No distance restraint was vio° lated by more than 0.4 A in any of the final structures. c Torsional restraints were applied to  angles with values of 120 30 for those angles with 3JHNH coupling constants 9.0 Hz and 60 30 for coupling constants 5.5 Hz.

mutate were chosen based on the sequence homology and the NMR structure of the DH domain of Trio that indicated the surface-exposed residues. In addition, mutant selection was based on the residues of the DH domain that interact with Rac1 as determined from an analysis of the amide signals of the DH domain that broaden upon the addition of Rac1 (Figure 3). For each of the mutants, the 15N-labeled protein was prepared, and the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was compared to that of the wild-type protein. Mutants that are structurally similar to wild type have 1H-15N HSQC spectra with only minor chemical shift differences for residues near the site of mutation. In contrast, mutant proteins that disrupt the fold show changes throughout the spectra. Only two of the mutants, Y1248A and Y1373A, caused changes indicative of a disruption of the native fold. All of the other mutants showed no evidence for mutantinduced conformational changes. Several mutant proteins displayed a decreased ability to catalyze nucleotide exchange compared to wild type (Figures 4A and 4B). Some of the mutant proteins even reduced the nucleotide exchange rate of Rac1 to below its intrinsic value (data not shown), suggesting that they inhibit GDP release. As shown in Figure 5, the mutations that had the greatest effect (V1367A, Q1368A, R1369A, T1371A, K1372A) are all located in the N-terminal portion of 9. Since none of these mutations disrupt the protein fold, they must block nucleotide exchange either by inhibiting the interaction with Rac1 or by directly affecting the enzymatic reaction. Mutations of other highly conserved amino acids in the vicinity of this region also significantly affected nucleotide exchange. For example, mutating L1375, a surface-exposed hydrophobic residue on 9 (Figure 5), led to a partial reduction in the exchange activity compared to the wild-type protein (Figure 4A). A similar level of inhibition of nucleotide exchange was observed for E1240A and T1244A. E1240 is located on 1 directly across from L1375 (Figure 5). Other conserved amino acids located further toward the C-terminal end of 9 (E1379) or on the opposite side of the protein (N1330) had little or no effect on nucleotide exchange when mutated to alanine (Figure 4A). Thus, the residues responsible for nucleotide exchange are located in close proximity to one another on either 1 or 9.

two residues may interact with each other to stabilize this section of the protein. The high degree of conservation of the residues that are responsible for the structural integrity of the protein suggests that the general architecture of all DH domains will be similar. Based on the structure and sequence homology, the differences will likely be due to variations in the lengths of the loops that connect the helices. Functionally Important Residues In order to identify the amino acids that are important for the enzymatic activity of the DH domain, site-directed mutants were prepared, and each was tested for its ability to catalyze nucleotide exchange. The residues to

Comparison to Other Exchange Factors The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal DH domain of Trio is very different from the previously determined structures of other GEFs, including EF-Ts (Kawashima et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997b), Sos (BoriackSjodin et al., 1998), Mss4 (Yu and Schreiber, 1995), and the Sec7 domain from ARNO (Cherfils et al., 1998; Mossessova et al., 1998) and cytohesin-1 (Betz et al., 1998). However, despite this structural diversity, there are some common features in their active sites. Almost all of the nucleotide exchange factors contain an exposed hydrophobic amino acid and an acidic residue that are important for nucleotide exchange. In EF-Ts, a phenylalanine and aspartic acid insert into EF-Tu, disrupt the structure, and cause the release of the magnesium ion and GDP (Kawashima et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997b).

The crystal structure of the Ras/Sos complex revealed that an helix from Sos, containing an exposed leucine (L938) and glutamic acid (E942), inserts into Ras. This causes a conformational change in the switch 1 and switch 2 regions that alters the binding site for magnesium and the phosphate groups of the nucleotide (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998). The Sec7 domains in the Arf exchange factors ARNO and cytohesin-1 (B2-1) have a key methionine and glutamic acid that are critical for their nucleotide exchange activity (Beraud-Dufour et al., ´ 1998; Betz et al., 1998; Cherfils et al., 1998; Mossessova et al., 1998). As in other GEFs, hydrophobic (V1367, L1375) and acidic residues (E1240) are important for the enzymatic activity of the DH domain of Trio. Based on the sequence similarity between H in Sos and 9 in the DH domain, it is tempting to speculate that the active site of the DH domain and Sos are very similar. In Sos, a threonine (T935), a hydrophobic residue (L938), and an acidic residue (E942) are located on the same helix that has been shown to be structurally important for interacting with Ras. This is reminiscent of T1371, L1375, and E1379 on 9 of the DH domain. Although T1371 and L1375 have an effect on nucleotide exchange, E1379 is not important. However, another nearby glutamic acid (E1240) on 1 has been found to have a partial effect on activity and may play the role of E942 in Sos. Other residues, such as R1369 and K1372, have a more dramatic effect on the exchange activity and may play a more primary role in the exchange reaction. These positively charged amino

acids could help displace the magnesium ion from Rac1 by interacting with the residues that chelate the metal. Indeed, the addition of Mg2 to the DH domain/Rac1 complex disrupts the interaction between these two proteins (data not shown). The structural role of R1369 and K1372 and other amino acids await the three-dimensional structure of the DH/Rac1 complex. Role of the Pleckstrin Homology Domain All proteins that have a DH domain also contain a pleckstrin homology domain located C-terminal to the DH module (Whitehead et al., 1997). PH domains have been shown to bind to G- subunits (Koch et al., 1993; Touhara et al., 1994) and acidic phospholipids (Harlan et al., 1994), suggesting that one of their major functions is to localize proteins to the membrane surface. In order to determine whether the PH domain of Trio was capable of binding to acidic phospholipids like other PH domains, in vitro lipid binding studies were performed. As shown in Figure 6, the Trio PH domain, either alone or when part of the DH­PH protein, associates with vesicles containing phosphatidyl inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P) and to a lesser extent phosphatidyl inositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P), comparable to the level of binding observed for the N-terminal PH domain of

pleckstrin (Harlan et al., 1994). However, no binding was observed for any of the PH domains to phosphatidyl inositol or phosphatidyl choline (Figure 6). These results imply that the Trio PH domain is capable of localizing the DH domain to the surface of a membrane containing acidic phospholipids that may be important for function. Indeed, when the PH domain in Lfc is removed, the ability of this DH-containing GEF to transform NIH 3T3 cells is eliminated but can be restored by replacing the PH domain with an isoprenylation site (Whitehead et al., 1995a). Membrane localization is also important for the activity of another Rho family GEF, Tiam-1, and requires a PH domain, although which one of the two Tiam-1 PH domains is controversial (Michiels et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997a). In addition to tethering proteins to membranes, recent evidence suggests that PH domains adjacent to DH domains may have other functions. For example, mutations in the PH domain of Sos severely impair the transforming activity even when the Sos protein was targeted to the membrane via an N-terminal myristoylation signal (Qian et al., 1998). Others have suggested that the function of the PH domain of Sos is to negatively regulate the nucleotide exchange activity of the adjacent DH domain (Nimnual et al., 1998). In this model, the inhibitory effect of the PH domain is relieved by the binding of the PH domain to acidic phospholipids. The role of the Dbl PH domain must also be different from membrane localization, since the replacement of the PH domain with membrane-targeting sequences failed to induce transformation (Zheng et al., 1996). In this case, the alternate function was suggested to be PH domain­mediated targeting to specific cytoskeletal locations. The idea that PH domains in DH-containing proteins have a special function is consistent with their invariant location. Unlike the PH domains contained in other proteins whose location is highly variable, the PH domain is always located C-terminal to the DH domain in DH-containing proteins.

To determine whether these PH domains can affect the nucleotide exchange activity of the DH domain independent of any possible membrane targeting role, the rate of GDP release catalyzed by the DH and DH­PH proteins were compared in an in vitro assay (Figure 4C). Surprisingly, the DH­PH protein catalyzed nucleotide exchange on Rac1 100-fold better than the DH domain alone. Moreover, the whole PH domain was required, since shorter DH­PH constructs containing only part of the PH domain have comparable activity to the DH alone (data not shown). These results imply an additional role for the PH domain other than promoting membrane localization that involves the enhancement of nucleotide exchange. The increase in the catalytic activity of the DH domain mediated by the PH domain could be due to a direct interaction between these modules (Zheng et al., 1997) or to an interaction between the PH domain and Rac1. However, it is unlikely that the PH domain causes any major structural alterations of the DH domain, since no obvious differences were observed in the 15N/1H amide chemical shifts of the DH domain in the DH and DH­PH proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, except for K1378A, the same mutations in the DH domain that had an effect on nucleotide exchange showed a similar effect when introduced in the DH­PH protein (Figures 4A and 4B). Conclusions Guanine nucleotide exchange factors all share the common function of disrupting the interaction between a GTPase and its associated nucleotide. This is accomplished by each of the GEF subfamilies in a distinct manner. The three-dimensional structures of the GEFs are very different, including the Rho family­specific enzymes, as illustrated by the solution structure of the N-terminal DH domain of Trio. In addition, the amino acid residues that catalyze nucleotide exchange vary among the GEF subfamilies. Although it appears that a key glutamic acid is common in most GEFs, this glutamic

NMR Structure of the N-Terminal DH Domain of Trio 275

acid is located in each case on a very different scaffold. In addition, the hydrophobic amino acids that affect nucleotide exchange are specific for each GEF. Moreover, other types of amino acids could be playing a critical catalytic role in the different GEF subfamilies, such as the positively charged residues R1369 and K1372 of the Trio DH domain. In contrast to GEFs, the three-dimensional structures of the PH domains are all similar (Ferguson et al., 1994; Macias et al., 1994; Yoon et al., 1994). Most PH domains bind to G- subunits and acidic phospholipids and act to localize proteins to the membrane. The role of the PH domains that are adjacent to DH domains has been less clear. Some investigators have provided evidence for a membrane-binding function, while others have suggested that these particular PH domains may have other activities. As shown here, the PH domain of the N-terminal GEF of Trio binds to acidic phospholipids like other PH domains. However, this PH domain can also increase the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of the adjacent DH domain in Trio. This novel function suggests that PH domains in DH domain­containing proteins (and possibly other PH domains) are not simply membrane-anchoring devices but may play other important roles in signal transduction.
Experimental Procedures Molecular Biology The cDNA clones encoding the N-terminal DH domain (residues 1227­1407), PH domain (residues 1408­1535), and DH­PH domain (residues 1227­1535) of Trio were isolated from human fetal brain poly A RNA (Clonetech) using standard RT-PCR. The expression plasmids for these proteins were constructed by inserting the appropriate cDNA fragments into the pET30b vector (Novagen). The recombinant proteins contained an extra methionine at the N terminus and a polyhistidine tag (-LEHHHHHH) at the C terminus to facilitate purification. Mutant constructs were prepared with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding region was sequenced in each case. NMR Spectroscopy For the NMR experiments, uniformly 15N- or 15N-,13C-labeled protein was prepared by growing the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) overexpressing the DH domain on M9 medium containing 15NH4Cl with or without [U-13C]-glucose. A uniformly 15N-,13C-labeled and fractionally deuterated protein sample was prepared by growing the cells in the presence of 75% 2H2O. In addition, a 15N, 13C, and 2H protein containing leucines and valines with protonated methyl groups and protonated 13 C-labeled phenylalanines was generated by growing E. coli in a minimal medium in 2H2O ( 98%) supplemented with methyl-protonated valine (Cambridge Isotopes) and 13C-labeled phenylalanine that was synthesized from 13C-labeled tyrosine. The recombinant DH domain was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-IDA column (Invitrogen). NMR samples contained 0.6 mM protein in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 20 mM NaCl in H2O/2H2O (9/1) or 2H2O. All NMR spectra were acquired at 32 C on a Bruker DRX 500, DRX 600, or DRX 800 NMR spectrometer. For the assignment of the 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of the backbone, a series of deuterium-decoupled triple resonance experiments [HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HN(CA)CB, HN(COCA)CB, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO] were recorded using the uniformly 15N-,13C-labeled and fractionally deuterated protein (Yamazaki et al., 1994). To aid in the backbone assignments, 15 N/1H HSQC spectra were recorded for protein samples that were selectively 15N-labeled by amino acid type (Leu, Val, Met, Lys, and Tyr). Side-chain resonances were assigned from 3D HCCH-TOCSY and HBHA(CO)NH experiments (Clore and Gronenborn, 1994) on

[U-15N-,13C]-labeled protein, HC(CO)NH-TOCSY experiments (Logan et al., 1993) on a [U-15N-,13C]-labeled and 75% fractionally deuterated sample, C(CO)NH-TOCSY experiment on a 15N-, 13C-, and 2H protein containing leucine and valine with protonated methyl groups, and a 15N-resolved TOCSY spectrum recorded on a 15N-labeled protein. Stereospecific assignment of the methyl groups of the valine and leucine residues were obtained from an analysis of a 1H, 13C HSQC spectrum recorded on a fractionally 13C-labeled sample as previously described (Neri et al., 1989). Distance restraints were obtained from 15N- or 13C-resolved 3D NOESY experiments recorded at a proton frequency of 800 MHz.  angle restraints were based on the 3JHN,H coupling constants measured in an HNHA experiment (Vuister and Bax, 1993), and 1 restraints were obtained from 3JN,C and 3JC ,C coupling constants (Grzesiek et al., 1993; Hu and Bax, 1997; Hu et al., 1997). Slow-exchanging amide protons were identified from a series of 1H/15N HSQC spectra recorded after the H2O buffer was changed to a 2H2O buffer. Residual dipolar couplings were calculated from the 1JN,H splittings measured using the IPAP method (Ottiger et al., 1998) for the DH domain in both the oriented and isotropic state. The DH domain was oriented with respect to the static magnetic field using a 5% (w/v) solution of DLPC/CHAPSO at a molar ratio of 4.2:1 (Wang et al., 1998). Structure Calculations Structures of the DH domain were calculated with a distance geometry/simulated annealing protocol (Kuszewski et al., 1992) using the CNS program (Brunger, 1998). The structure calculations employed ¨ 1722 proton/proton distance restraints, 130 hydrogen bond distance restraints derived for 65 slow-exchanging amide protons, 64  angle restraints, 34 1 angle restraints, and 66 angle restraints derived from residual dipolar couplings. The NOE-derived restraints were categorized based on the observed NOE intensities. GDP Release Assays A modified version of the method of Debant et al. (1996) was used in the GDP release assay. [3H]GDP-loaded proteins were prepared by incubating 0.5 g purified Rac-1 in 90 l loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA) with 7 Ci [3H]GDP (26.8 Ci/mmol NEN) for 20 min at 20 C. The reaction was then terminated with 90 l stop buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA) and then diluted with 1.5 ml dilution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM GTP). Purified Trio proteins (20 g of DH or 250 ng of DHPH) were added to 80 l of the GDP-loaded Rac1 and incubated at 20 C for 0, 10, 20, or 30 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 0.5 ml wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, [pH 7.5], 10 mM MgCl2) and immediate filtration through a nitrocellulose filter (BA85, 0.45 m; Schleicher and Schuell) followed by two washes with wash buffer. Filters were dried, and the amount of [3H]GDP bound to the filters was determined. Each mutant was assayed in at least three independent assays. Relative percentage [3H]GDP bound was determined for each protein by the following formula: 100 (cpm)/(cpm at time 0). Phospholipid Binding Assay The binding of the PH and DH­PH domains to phospholipids was determined with unilamellar vesicles in a centrifugation assay. Organic solvent was evaporated from the lipid solutions under nitrogen, buffer was added, and the lipid suspensions were subjected to five rounds of rapid freeze-thaw cycles followed by repeated extrusion through 0.1 m pore-size polycarbonate membranes (ten passes) (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The proteins were incubated with PtdIns-4P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 (5% [wt/wt]) in unilamellar vesicles containing 1,2-distearoyl (dibromo)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (BrPC) in 50 mM bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl. Protein (25 l at 0.4 mg/ ml) and lipid vesicles (25 l at 10 mg/ml, total lipid concentration) were added to centrifuge tubes, vortexed, incubated for 5 min, and then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 g for 30 min in a Beckman model TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The protein concentrations of the supernatants (25 l) were then determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). PH domain binding to BrPC vesicles alone [without PtdIns-4P or PtdIns(4,5)P2] was used to determine background binding.
