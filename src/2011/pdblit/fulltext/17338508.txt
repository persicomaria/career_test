Factor Xa inhibitory activities for a series of N-{(3S)-1-[(1S)-1-methyl-2-morpholin-4-yl-2-oxoethyl]-2oxopyrrolidin-3-yl}sulfonamides with different P1 groups are described. These data provide insight into binding interactions within the S1 primary specificity pocket; rationales are presented for the derived SAR on the basis of electronic interactions through crystal structures of fXa-ligand complexes and molecular modeling studies. A good correlation between in vitro anticoagulant activities with lipophilicity and the extent of human serum albumin binding is observed within this series of potent fXa inhibitors. Pharmacokinetic profiles in rat and dog, together with selectivity over other trypsin-like serine proteases, identified 1f as a candidate for further evaluation.
Introduction Thrombosis is a multifactorial disorder initiated by intravascular blood clotting leading to thrombus formation in an artery or vein. The resultant thrombi can be obstructive or dislodged into smaller blood vessels, depriving vital organs of oxygen (ischemia), which can be catastrophic. Manifestation of these life threatening conditions includes myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Drugs that inhibit the blood clotting process can prevent these events, and the development of antithrombotics is a major focus of pharmaceutical research.1 A number of antithrombotics such as aspirin, heparin, low molecular weight heparins,2 and warfarin3 are used clinically, but these drugs suffer from limited efficacy, low oral bioavailability, or a narrow therapeutic window. Indeed, administration of warfarin, a vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitor, requires individual treatment with continuous dose adjustment and laboratory monitoring because of its interactions with other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Furthermore, warfarin has a slow onset of action. A key driver of thrombus formation is the dysregulation of blood coagulation, which consists of the interconnected intrinsic and extrinsic pathways4 that converge onto the formation of activated factor X (fXa). When bound to factor Va, calcium, phospholipid, and prothrombin (prothrombinase complex), fXa converts prothrombin into thrombin which in turn proteolytically converts fibrinogen into fibrin. Ultimately, fibrin chains are cross-linked into an insoluble matrix (the blood clot). Thus, thrombin and fXa are attractive targets5 for pharmacological

intervention. Indeed, fondaparinux,6 a selective indirect fXa inhibitor suitable for subcutaneous administration, has been approved for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing major orthopaedic (hip or knee replacement) surgery. Furthermore, direct thrombin and fXa inhibitors have also shown encouraging results for the prevention of thromboembolic events in clinical studies.7a-d Ximelagatran, the first registered, orally active thrombin inhibitor, was approved in Europe for the prevention of thrombosis in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement, but was withdrawn from the market due to concerns over toxicity in the liver.7e Currently a number of orally active thrombin [e.g., MCC-977, dabigatran etexilate]8 and fXa [e.g., rivaroxaban, LY-517717, apixaban, and DU176b]9a-g inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials for similar conditions. In addition, DX-9065a is currently in clinical trials for parenteral indications.9h-i As part of our program to develop efficacious and orally bioavailable anticoagulants, we have identified highly selective and potent thrombin10 and fXa inhibitors with good anticoagulant activities and promising profiles for chronic oral administration. Factor Xa inhibitors containing the 3-aminopyrrolidin-2-one scaffold and highly basic benzamidine P1 substituents have been disclosed previously.11a Our own studies11b with this scaffold have led to a nonbasic series of novel and orally active fXa inhibitors incorporating 6-chloro-N-[(3S)-1-substituted-2-oxo-3-pyrrolidinyl]-2-naphthalenesulfonamides and identified 1a as our lead compound.

crystal structure of 1a bound to fXa (Figure 1) clearly showed that the 6-chloronaphth-2-yl group bound in the S1 primary specificity pocket and the morpholino amide occupies the aromatic box (Tyr99, Try215, and Phe174) of the S4 pocket. The pendent methyl group of the alanyl motif binds to a small subpocket formed by Phe174 and the carbon atoms of the sidechain of Glu217. Herein, we extend our study and describe a systematic investigation into the effects of sulfonamido R1 substituents on fXa inhibitory activities and anticoagulant activities within the N-{(3S)-1-[(1S)-1-methyl-2-morpholin-4yl-2-oxoethyl]-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl}sulfonamide series. Our understanding of the tolerance of sulfonamido groups within the S1 pocket through X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling studies is compared and contrasted with those reported in the literature for alternative series of fXa inhibitors. Correlation of anticoagulant activities with lipophilicity and the extent of human serum albumin (HSA) binding are highlighted together with pharmacokinetic data that led to the identification of 1f as a candidate for further evaluation. Chemistry The key intermediate amine 2 was readily prepared from N-CBZ-L-methionine (Scheme 1) by coupling with L-alanine t-butyl ester under standard conditions using 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and Nhydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in the presence of triethylamine to give as an intermediate the protected dipeptide 3. Activation of the methylthioether moiety of 3 with iodomethane, followed

by base-induced cyclization12 with the hydroxide form of Dowex ion-exchange resin, established the pyrrolidin-2-one system, which was deprotected with TFA in DCM to provide the carboxylic acid 4. Amide coupling with morpholine using O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) and i-Pr2NEt, followed by deprotection under palladium-catalyzed hydrogenolysis, thereby yielded the key amine intermediate 2. The secondary sulfonamides 1a-1h, 1j-1p, and 1s-1y were prepared by sulfonylation of the (3S)-aminopyrrolidin-2-one alanylamide 2 with appropriate sulfonyl chlorides, R1SO2Cl, 6, or suitably protected derivatives thereof under standard conditions (see Method A in General Procedures). R1s are defined in Table 1. When Boc was used as a protecting group, its removal was effected with TFA in DCM (for 1s and 1t). With the exception of 6h, 6n, and 6u-6y, all other sulfonyl chlorides were either available commercially (6m) or prepared according to literature procedures (6a-6g,13,14 6j-6l,14,15 6o,16 6p,16 N-Boc of 6s,17 and N-Boc of 6t17). Sulfonyl chlorides 6h, 6n, and 6u6w were synthesized from the corresponding chloroheteroaromatics by direct lithiation with n-BuLi at -78 °C, followed by sulfinylation with SO2 and chlorinative oxidation with NCS (Scheme 2). In the case of 6y, lithiation was carried out by metal-halogen exchange of 5-bromo-2-(5-chloro-2-thienyl)pyridine18 with t-BuLi, followed by sulfinylation and chlorinative oxidation as above to provide the requisite sulfonyl chloride. The chloro-bis(heteroaryls) were prepared by palladiumcatalyzed coupling reactions. Thus, 5-(5-chloro-2-thienyl)-1,3thiazole, 2-(5-chloro-2-thienyl)-1,3-thiazole, and 5-chloro-2-(2thienyl)-1,3-thiazole were prepared by Suzuki coupling of either 2- or 5-bromothiazole19a with 5-chlorothiophene-2-boronic acid or 2-bromo-5-chlorothiazole19b with thiophene-2-boronic acid. 2-(5-Chloro-2-thienyl)furan was synthesized via Stille coupling of the tri-n-butyl-2-(furanyl)stannane with 2-bromo-5-chlorothiophene. 3-(5-Chloro-2-thienyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-5-sulfonyl chloride 6x was prepared by the reaction of thiourea with 5-chloro-2-thiophenecarbohydrazide20 at 160 °C in the absence of solvent, followed by careful oxidation of the resultant mercaptotriazolyl derivative with chlorine in AcOH (Scheme 3). The sulfonyl chlorides described above were generally used for sulfonylation with 2 without purification. Due to complications in the synthesis of 6q,21 an alternative and indirect synthesis for 1q and 1r was employed. Thus, S-chlorination of the appropriate chloro-1,3-benzothiazole2(3H)-thione22 using NCS, followed by sulfenylation with 2 and oxidation with KMnO4, provided the 5- and 6-chloro-1,3benzothiazole-2-sulfonamido derivatives 1q and 1r (Scheme 4). Compound 1i was synthesized via the sulfonylation of 2 with 4-iodophenylsulfonyl chloride to give 7. Sonagashira coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene in the presence of Et3N and catalytic amounts of CuI and PdCl2(PPh3)2 in DMF at room temperature, followed by the removal of the trimethylsilyl group with TBAF yielded the acetylenic compound 8. Hydroborative chlorination23 with t-hexylborane and cupric chloride afforded the required 1i (Scheme 5). Results and Discussion The influence of sulfonamido R1 substituents on fXa inhibitory activities has been investigated within a series of N-{(3S)1-[(1S)-1-methyl-2-morpholin-4-yl-2-oxoethyl]-2-oxopyrrolidin3-yl}sulfonamides (Table 1). 6-Chloronaphthyl, 5-chloro-2,2bithienyl, 4-chlorostyryl, 5- and 6-chlorobenzothienyl, and 5-chlorothienylethenyl analogues 1a-1f show good to excellent fXa inhibitory activities (Ki ) 4-47 nM).

these and other chloroheteroaryl P1s have been reported13c,24,25 with other structural classes of fXa inhibitors. Basic P1 groups such as 3- and 4-substituted benzamidines in first generation fXa inhibitors26 have been reported to interact with Asp189 in the S1 pocket. In contrast, 1a-1f are nonbasic and, at the outset of our program, before X-ray crystal structures of our compounds bound to fXa were available, their binding orientation was uncertain. Evidence that chloroaromatic groups could bind in the S1 pocket was obtained by elegant 19F NMR studies of a 6-fluoronaphthyl containing inhibitor bound to fXa with and without Gd-EDTAa complex as well as competitive displacement studies with a 6-chloronaphthyl containing fXa inhibitor.27 Confirmation of a similar binding mode in the present series was established by X-ray crystal structures of these compounds

complexed with fXa (Figures 1-3), which showed clearly that the chloroaromatics in 1a, 1b, 1d, and 1e bound within the S1 pocket. The morpholino group occupied the S4 pocket with the alanyl methyl group bound to a small hydrophobic pocket near to S4. In contrast to a related series28 in which 3R stereochemistry is preferred and the pyrrolidin-2-one CdO is hydrogenbonded to Gly219,28 the corresponding carbonyl in our series is indirectly hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl of Ser214 via a water-mediated interaction. These interactions are similar to that reported for 1a (Figure 1) in our previous communication.11b In contrast to the flat and rigid chlorobenzothienyl and chloronaphthyl P1s present in 1d, 1e, and 1a, respectively, the two thienyl rings in 1b are out of coplanarity (S-C-C-S torsion ca. 159°), which is in good agreement with that reported for the lowest energy conformer of bithiophene.29 Our crystal structures show the chlorine atom is 3.7-4.2 Å from the centroid

of the phenolic ring of Tyr228 in the S1 pocket. This interaction has been reported in the literature as hydrophobic for other series of fXa inhibitors.24 However, we believe there is an electrostatic component to this interaction based on electrostatic potential maps for these chloroaromatics, which showed a slight positive charge at the center of the Cl atom.30 Indeed, support for this

hypothesis arose by replacing the Cl atom with the isosteric methyl group, which resulted in over 10-fold loss in activity [1g vs 1a]. Furthermore, polarization of the aromatic proton facing Asp189 by the adjacent chlorine atom could provide an additional interaction (nonclassical hydrogen bonding),31 which could augment the binding affinity of chloroaromatics. However, this latter interaction is unlikely to be present in 1h and 1i, the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene analogue and the reversed analogue of 1c, respectively. In the bioactive conformation of 1h, the sulfur atom in the chlorothieno moiety is expected to occupy the equivalent volume of space that faces Asp189 and, therefore, cannot attain the nonclassical hydrogen bonding interaction mentioned above. When bound to fXa, the proton attached to the same carbon as the Cl atom in the chlorovinyl moiety of 1i is unlikely to align directly with the carboxylate of Asp189 and is also over 4 Å away to contribute any significant binding affinity. These considerations could provide an explanation for the moderate potency of 1h and 1i. Replacement of the aromatic carbon atom by nitrogen in the chloroaryl ring is generally detrimental to their fXa inhibitory activities (1j-1n), which may be explained following close analysis of X-ray crystal structures of 1b, 1d, and 1e (Figures 2 and 3) bound to fXa. Analogous to 1a, the chloroaromatics in 1b, 1d, and 1e are bound to the S1 pocket and display a similar vector for the Cl-Tyr228 interaction. Assuming all chloroheteroaryl analogues maintain this highly favorable ClTyr228 interaction, it is possible to predict the position of the

nitrogen in the chloroheteroaromatic rings of compounds 1j1n. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom in the ring of 1k-1n is placed in a highly electron-rich environment formed by the backbone carbonyl of Gly219 and the carboxylate of Asp189. Such a highly unfavorable interaction is reflected in their poor intrinsic activities. In contrast, 1j is moderately potent (Ki ) 163 nM) and is predicted to bind with the nitrogen facing the other side of the S1 pocket, which is likely less electron rich and, therefore, a more favorable environment. Modifications to the aromatic ring distal to the chlorine atom (i.e., directly attached to SO2 of the sulfonamido group) are shown in 1o-1y. In the 5,6-fused aromatic systems, 1o-1t are moderate to weakly active. Interestingly, within each isomeric pair (5- and 6-chloro isomers) of benzofurans and benzothiazoles, one member (1p, 1q) is significantly less active than the other (1o, 1r). However, both chloroindolyl analogues (1s and 1t) have similarly moderate activities. Ab initio calculations for the conformational preference of the 5-membered ring heteroaryl-2-sulfonamides, as model systems for 1o-1t, showed32 that one of the SdO bonds prefers to be coplanar with the Cs H, planar NsH, or S in these aromatic systems. When this conformational preference is translated into the 5,6-fused chlorobenzoheteroaryl systems and the important Cl-Tyr228 interaction is maintained, there are significant energy penalties for the bioactive conformations of 1p and 1q. Hence, 5-benzofuryl (1p) and 6-chlorobenzothiazolyl (1q) analogues are less potent than their corresponding isomers 1o and 1r. The similar activities of 5- and 6-chloroindolyl isomers (1s and 1t) could also be explained by the little difference in energy between the conformers of the sulfonamido SdO that eclipse the CsH or NsH of the pyrrole ring in 1H-pyrrole-2-sulfonamide. The thienylsulfonamido heteroaromatic ring in the chlorobithienyl P1 analogue 1b is positioned further away from the bottom of the S1 pocket than the ring distal to the chlorine atom in the benzothienyl analogues (vide supra: 1b in Figure 2 vs 1d and 1e in Figure 3). Therefore, this thienyl ring is likely to be further away from potential unfavorable interactions in the lower half of the S1 binding pocket (cf. rationales for 1k-1n

above), and replacement of aromatic carbons by nitrogen are expected to be better tolerated. Furthermore, the rotatable bond between the two thienyl rings in 1b can be twisted to alleviate any possible unfavorable interactions. Indeed both the thiazolyl analogues (1v and 1w) retain potent fXa inhibitory activities (Ki ) 5 and 2 nM, respectively) in contrast to the benzothiazolyl analogues (1q and 1r, Ki ) 4160 and 112 nM, respectively). Even replacing the thiazolyl ring by a 6-membered pyridyl ring (1y) retains good potency (Ki ) 24 nM). However, both the furyl (1u) and triazolyl (1x) analogues are significantly less potent. The weak fXa inhibitory activity of 1u may be rationalized by the preferred conformation of the P1 sulfonamido group in which one of the SdO bonds eclipses the CH of the furan ring (vide supra) while maintaining the highly favorable Cl-Tyr228 interaction.32 This would position the furyl oxygen atom on the same side as the sulfur atom of the chlorothienyl unit and could change to a less favorable bioactive conformation of 1u relative to 1b.

the triazolyl analogue 1x with 1b (Figure 4) in fXa revealed such a distortion, which could account for the weaker intrinsic activity of 1x. While the S atom of the thiophene ring proximal to the sulfonamido group in 1b is orientated toward Gly219, the N atom at the 1 position of the 1,3,4-triazolyl group in 1x appears to be indirectly hydrogen-bonded to Ser214 via a water molecule. This distortion is amplified in the binding of the pyrrolidin-2-one and the morpholinoalanylamide in which the previously observed water-mediated interaction of the pyrrolidin2-one CdO with Ser214 is now absent in 1x. The anticoagulant activities of compounds with fXa Ki values e47 nM (1a-1f, 1v, 1w, and 1y) together with their logD values, determined at pH 7.4, and binding to immobilized human serum albumin (HSA) in a high throughput HPLC assay33 are shown in Table 2. These compounds showed a broad range of anticoagulant activities (1.5xPT 1.2-49.2 µM), which did not correlate with their intrinsic fXa affinities. Indeed the fall off in plasma-based activities relative to their fXa inhibitory activities ranged from 2 to 4 orders of magnitude. The biggest fall off in 1.5xPT values was observed with the bithienyl and related bi(heteroaromatic) P1s (1b, 1v and 1w). In particular, there is over 20 000-fold difference between fXa affinity and anticoagulant activity for 1w. These more lipophilic analogues (logD 2.03-2.18 at pH 7.4) showed high protein binding (>90% bound to HSA), which could account for their weaker than expected anticoagulant activities (1.5xPT 10.4-49.2 uM). Indeed there is a good correlation of the degree of HSA binding with lipophilicity (logD at pH 7.4) for this series of compounds. Thus, good anticoagulant activities (1.5xPT 1.2-7.5 uM) were observed for compounds (1a, 1c, 1e, and 1f) that are more hydrophilic (logD 1.47-1.85 at pH 7.4) and showed <90% HSA binding, while having similar potent fXa inhibitory activities (Ki ) 5-16 nM). Selected compounds (1a-1f) with good anticoagulant activities were evaluated against a panel of other trypsin-like serine proteases (Table 3). These compounds have excellent selectivity over trypsin, kallikrein, and the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin. Against other proteases in the coagulation process, thrombin activities were weaker with good selectivities seen for 1a, 1b, and 1f, while no significant activities against activated protein C, TF/factor VIIa, and factor XIIa were detected.

The pharmacokinetic profiles of compounds with good anticoagulant activities were initially ranked using either one to two animals or a cassette dosing regiment with four animals. Compounds 1a-1f showed promising pharmacokinetic properties (plasma clearance 3-18 mL/min/kg, volumes of distribution 0.17-0.6 L/kg, half-lives 0.57-1.5 h) and high oral bioavailabilities (69-100%) in rat. Definitive studies (n ) 3) in both rat and dog were then carried out with 1f, which showed encouraging pharmacokinetic profiles with high oral bioavailabilities (Table 4). Based on a combination of attractive in vitro and pharmacokinetic profiles, 1f was selected as a candidate for further evaluation. Its antithrombotic profile and further pharmacological evaluation will be reported separately.34 Conclusions Systematic modifications to a series of N-{(3S)-1-[(1S)-1methyl-2-morpholin-4-yl-2-oxoethyl]-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl}sulfonamides have resulted in a number of highly potent fXa inhibitors (1a-1f, 1s, 1v, 1w, and 1y). X-ray crystallography of selected ligands in fXa and molecular modeling studies has provided rationales for the derived SAR. The importance of both electrostatic and steric interactions of the chlorine atom to the phenolic centroid of Tyr228 has been highlighted. Modifications to the chloroaromatic ring through the replacement of C-H by nitrogen atom are generally detrimental due to the presence of polar groups (e.g., carboxylate of Asp189 and carbonyl backbone of Gly219) which form one side of the S1 pocket. However, there is a greater scope to modify the aromatic ring attached to the sulfonamido group, which is also influenced by the torsional preference of the NSO2-heteroaryl bond. Relative to their fXa affinities, good anticoagulant activities have been identified for the more hydrophilic analogues that show <90% binding to HSA. Against a panel of other trypsin-like serine proteases, these compounds showed excellent selectivities against trypsin, kallikrein, and the fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin. With respect to other proteases in the coagulation process, analogues with good selectivities against thrombin and no significant activities against activated protein C, TF/factor VIIa, and factor XIIa have been identified. Together with the good pharmacokinetic profile in rats and dogs, 1f was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

Experimental Section
General Procedures. All general purpose solvents used were Fisons analytical reagents. Anhydrous solvents (Sureseal) were purchased from Aldrich and Fluka. All other reagents were usually obtained from Aldrich, Fluka, or Lancaster. All reactions involving organometallic reagents were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere. Reactions were monitored either by LC-MS or TLC using Merck 60 F254 silica gel glass backed plates (5 × 10 cm), eluted with suitable solvent mixtures and visualized by UV light, followed by heating with aqueous phosphomolybdic acid. LC-MS were run on a Hewlett-Packard 1050 coupled with a Micromass Platform Series II or Waters ZQ [using electrospray (ES) positive or negative ionization modes] equipped with a Supelcosil ABZ+PLUS column (3 µm, 3.3 cm × 4.6 mm ID). Standard conditions were eluent systems A (H2O, 0.1% formic acid, 10 mmol ammonium acetate) and B (95% MeCN and 0.05% formic acid in H2O): gradient 100% A 0.7 min, 100% A-100% B 4.2 min, 100% B 1.1 min, 100-0% B 0.2 min; flow rate ) 3 mL/min). Purifications were performed on silica SPE (solid-phase extraction) eluted under suction or using an OPTIX-10 system, Biotage chromatography using prepacked Kieselgel columns, preparative hplc or mass-directed autoprep. SPE refers to the use of cartridges sold by International Sorbent Technology, Ltd. OPTIX-10 refers to the ISCO OPTIX 10 automated chromatography system. This uses pumps to give gradient control of solvents and variable wavelength UV detection and trigger for fraction collection ( ) 254 nm, unless specified). Biotage chromatography refers to purification carried out using equipment sold by Dyax Corporation (either the Flash 40i or Flash 150i) and cartridges prepacked with KPSil. Preparative HPLC refers to methods where the material was purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Supelcosil ABZ+ PLUS column (5 µm, 10 cm × 21.2 mm i.d.) with 0.1% HCO2H in water (A) and MeCN (0.5% HCO2H; B) utilizing the generic gradient elution conditions expressed as "x to y" gradient with a gradient system as follows: 0-1.45 min x %B, 1.45-20 min x to y %B, 20-24 min y to 95% B, 24-30 min 95% B, 32-34 min 95 to x %B at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. The Gilson 233 fraction collector was triggered by UV (254 nm unless specified). Mass directed autoprep refers to methods where the material was purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a HPLCABZ+ 5 µm column (5 cm × 10 mm i.d.) with 0.1% HCO2H in water and 95% MeCN, 5% water (0.5% HCO2H) utilizing the following gradient elution conditions: 0-1.0 min 5% B, 1.0-8.0 min 5 to 30% B, 8.0-8.9 min 30% B, 8.9-9.0 min 30-95% B, 9.0-9.9 min 95% B, 9.9-10 min 95-0% B at a flow rate of 8 mL/min (System 2). The Gilson 202-fraction collector was triggered by a Micromass ZMD Mass Spectrometer on detecting the mass of interest. Where appropriate, test compounds were isolated from their aqueous solutions, if necessary, in the presence of 1,4-dioxan, by freezedrying using Edwards Freeze Dryer Modulyo. GC-MS was performed on a HP5973MSD with CTC Combipal injector, using 1/100 split injection and chemical ionization with ammonia or methane as collision gas, equipped with HP5 5% phenyl methyl siloxane column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm). Standard GC condition was 80-320 °C at 50 °C/min over 10 min using helium as carrier gas at 1.5 mL/min. Mass spectra were run by an electrospray Hewlett-Packard 5989B instrument. All NMR spectra were run on a Bruker DPX 400 MHz instrument in an appropriate deuterated solvent using tetramethylsilane or residual hydrogenated solvent as standard. Elemental microanalyses were determined by Butterworth Laboratories Limited, Teddington, Middlesex, U.K. High-resolution mass spectra were obtained as positive ion accurate mass centroided data using a Micromass Q-Tof 2 hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer, equipped with a Z-spray interface, over a mass range of 80-1200 Da, with a scan time of 0.95 s, and an interscan delay of 0.07 s, using reserpine as the external mass calibrant ([M + H]+ ) 609.2812 Da). t-Butyl N-[(Benzyloxy)carbonyl]-L-methionyl-L-alaninate 3.

Purified des-Gla fXa was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The protein was further purified on a weak cation-exchange resin (carboxymethyl (CM) sepharose, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in a solution containing 25 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) from which protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient. Protein was then buffer exchanged into a solution containing 5 mM Mesa-NaOH (pH 6.0), 5 mM CaCl2, and up to 1 µM crystallization tool compound RPR12851535 prior to concentration to approximately 5 mg/mL for crystallization experiments in a Vivaspin ultracentrifugation unit (Vivascience, Hanover, Germany). Crystallizaton was carried out using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in 2 µl drops containing a 1:1 mixture of protein and well solution. Well solution contained 16-20% PEGa 6 K, 50 mM Mesa-NaOH (pH 5.7-6.0), 5 mM CaCl2, and 50 mM NaCl. Streak seeding followed by macroseeding, using the derived small crystals, routinely gave needle-shaped crystals (size 200 × 50 × 50 µm) suitable for synchrotron X-ray data collection. X-ray Data Collection and Processing. Compound was prepared as a 100 mM stock in DMSO for soaking experiments. Crystals were soaked in 20 µl well solution containing 1-5 mM compound and 5-10% DMSO for up to 1 week. Prior to freezing at 100 K, the crystals were briefly transferred to well solution with 20% glycerol included. The X-ray intensity data was collected at either the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, UK) on station 9.6 or the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) on beamlines ID29 or ID14 eh4. Data processing and scaling was carried out using DENZO and SCALEPACK,36 except for 1x, which was processed using MOSFLM.37 All crystals have P212121 symmetry and similar cell dimension, a  56.8 Å, b  72.3 Å, and c  79.5 Å. Structure Solution and Crystallographic Refinement. The initial structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of 1ezq,35 a fXa complex structure from the RCSB Protein Data Bank with ligand removed as the search model. Subsequent structures were solved using difference Fouriers. Model building, including ligand fitting, was carried out in QUANTA2000

(Accelrys). All other data manipulation was carried out using programs from the CCP4 suite,38 including crystallographic refinement using REFMAC.39 All nonglycine residues fall within the energetically favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot. All of the atoms of the inhibitors and residues in the vicinity of the active site lie in well-defined electron density. The majority of the rest of the protein is in well-determined electron density, except for the EGF1 domain, which was not visible. The statistics of the crystallographic refinement are shown in Table 5. Atomic coordinates have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (2cji for 1a, 2j95 for 1b, 2j38 for 1d, 2j34 for 1e, and 2j94 for 1x). In Vitro Assay for Inhibition of Factor Xa. The ability of test compounds to inhibit human fXa in vitro was determined in a fluorescence assay, using rhodamime 110, bis-(Boc-L-glycylglycylL-arginine amide) as the fluorogenic substrate. Test compounds were diluted from a 10 mM DMSO solution to the final assay concentration range of 166 µM to 0.09 nM. Assay was performed at roomtemperature using buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPESa, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl2 at pH 7.4 containing human factor Xa (0.2 nM final concentration). Test compound and enzyme were preincubated for 15 min prior to addition of the substrate (0.01 mM final concentration). Incubation was for 3 h, after which a LJL Analyst (now marketed by Molecular Devices Corporation) was used to monitor the fluorescence at 485/535 nm wavelength. Analysis of the derived data using Activity Base, a curve fitting software from IDBS, gave the pIC50 and pKi values from which Ki values were derived. Prothrombin Time (PT) Assay.40 Blood from two female and two male donors, supplied by Biological Specialty Corporation (Colmar, PA), was collected into 3.8% sodium citrate vacutainers and mixed gently. Plasma was generated by centrifugation of the citrated blood samples at 1200 g for 20 min at room temperature and stored at -20 °C until use. Prior to assay, plasma from four different human subjects (two male and two female) was thawed and pooled. PT assays were performed at 37 °C using the Dade Behring BCS Coagulation System (n ) 2 trials). An amount equal to 50 µL of plasma containing test compound at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 100 µM (made from a 100 µM plasma stock containing 1% DMSO and prepared by the coagulation analyzer) was combined with 100 µL of thromboplastin C Plus (Dade Behring, Newark, DE). Absorbance at 405 nm was then monitored and time (sec) to clot formation at each concentration of test compound was determined and compared to time to clot formation of control (human plasma in the absence of test compound) and reported as the fold-increase in PT. The concentration of test compound, which yield 1.5-fold extension in PT in the human plasma, was estimated using a mathematical model.41 The extrapolated 1.5× concentration was validated by spiking the plasma with this exact concentration of test compound, and the resulting PT was compared to that of control plasma. The 1.5× concentration was considered accurate if they caused the plasma to clot 1.5-fold slower than control plasma. Pharmacokinetic Studies. The formulation used for both i.v. and p.o. dosing to rat and dog was a 5:95% (v/v) mixture of DMSO and 50:50 PEGa-200/sterile water. For all animal studies, serial blood samples were collected into heparinised containers at various time-points and blood centrifuged to yield plasma.
