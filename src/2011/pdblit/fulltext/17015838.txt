The DNA-binding domain of the tumor suppressor p53 is inactivated by mutation in 50% of human cancers. We have solved high-resolution crystal structures of several oncogenic mutants to investigate the structural basis of inactivation and provide information for designing drugs that may rescue inactivated mutants. We found a variety of structural consequences upon mutation: (i) the removal of an essential contact with DNA, (ii) creation of large, water-accessible crevices or hydrophobic internal cavities with no other structural changes but with a large loss of thermodynamic stability, (iii) distortion of the DNA-binding surface, and (iv) alterations to surfaces not directly involved in DNA binding but involved in domain­ domain interactions on binding as a tetramer. These findings explain differences in functional properties and associated phenotypes (e.g., temperature sensitivity). Some mutants have the potential of being rescued by a generic stabilizing drug. In addition, a mutation-induced crevice is a potential target site for a mutant-selective stabilizing drug.

he tumor suppressor protein p53 is a 393-aa transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle and plays a key role in the prevention of cancer development. In response to oncogenic and other stresses, p53 induces the transcription of a number of target genes, resulting in cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis (1, 2). In 50% of human cancers, p53 is inactivated as a result of missense mutation in the p53 gene (3, 4). The multifunctionality of p53 is reflected in the complexity of its structure. Each chain in the p53 tetramer is composed of several domains. There are well defined DNA-binding and tetramerization domains and highly mobile, largely unstructured regions (5­9). Most p53 cancer mutations are located in the DNA-binding core domain of the protein (3). This domain has been structurally characterized in complex with its cognate DNA by x-ray crystallography (5, 10, 11) and in its free form in solution by NMR (12). It consists of a central -sandwich that serves as a basic scaffold for the DNA-binding surface. The DNA-binding surface is composed of two large loops (L2 and L3) that are stabilized by a zinc ion and a loop­sheet­helix motif. Together, these structural elements form an extended surface that makes specific contacts with the various p53 response elements. The six amino acid residues that are most frequently mutated in human cancer are located in or close to the DNA-binding surface (compare release R10 of the TP53 mutation database at www-p53.iarc.fr) (3). These residues have been classified as ``contact'' (Arg-248 and Arg-273) or ``structural'' (Arg-175, Gly-245, Arg-249, and Arg-282) residues, depending on whether they directly contact DNA or play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the DNA-binding surface (Fig. 1) (5). Urea denaturation studies have shown that the contact mutation R273H has no effect on the thermodynamic stability of the core domain, whereas structural mutations substantially destabilize the protein to varying degrees, ranging from 1 kcal mol for G245S and 2 kcal mol for R249S up to 3 kcal mol for R282W (13). The destabilization has severe implications for the folding state of these mutants in the cell. Because the wild-type core

domain is only marginally stable and has a melting temperature only slightly above body temperature, highly destabilized mutants such as R282W are largely unfolded under physiological conditions and, hence, are no longer functional (14). To understand the role of individual mutants in carcinogenesis and to assess the possibility of rescuing their function, it is important to know the effect of the mutation not only on the overall stability but also on the local structure. Qualitative NMR studies indicate that hotspot mutants evince characteristic local structural changes (15). We have recently elucidated the structural effects of the contact mutation R273H and the structural mutation R249S by x-ray crystallography (16). In addition, these structural studies revealed that the second-site suppressor mutation H168R rescues the function of R249S in a specific manner by mimicking the structural role of Arg-249 in the wild type (16).

Here, we extend our crystallographic studies on the p53 core domain to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the effects of common cancer mutations on the structure and function of p53. Using a stabilized variant of the p53 core domain (T-p53C), we have elucidated the diverse structural effects of cancer hotspot mutations in the DNA-binding surface (G245S, R273C, and R282W) and at the periphery of the -sandwich (Y220C), as well as the effects of highly destabilizing, cavity-creating mutations (V143A and F270L) in the hydrophobic core of the -sandwich region of the protein (Fig. 1). Results and Discussion We focused our crystallographic studies on cancer-hotspot mutations in the DNA-binding surface (G245S, R273C, and R282W) and at the far end of the -sandwich (Y220C), as well as on two potentially cavity-creating cancer mutations (V143A and F270L) in the hydrophobic core of the -sandwich (Fig. 1). To do this, we introduced these mutations into a stabilized variant of p53 core domain (T-p53C). T-p53C contains four point mutations (M133L, V203A, N239Y, and N268D) that stabilize the core domain by 2.6 kcal mol. It has wild-type-like DNA-binding properties, its full-length version is fully active in human cells (Sebastian Mayer and A.R.F., unpublished data), and the structure is essentially the same as that of the wild type, apart from the mutated side chains, which confer additional stability (17). The effects of the mutations are simply to raise the Tm of the protein and its mutants by 6°C, making them easier to handle (18). The crystallization conditions for five of the six mutants were similar to those for T-p53C, and the obtained crystals were isomorphous. They belonged to space group P212121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and the corresponding structures were determined at high resolution ranging from 1.6 to 1.8 Å (Table 1, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). In all of these five constructs containing an extended C terminus (residues 94­312), the C-terminal residues beyond Lys-291 were disordered, as found previously (5, 16, 17). For T-p53C-G245S, a shorter construct was used (residues 94­293), and we obtained crystals in a new crystal form (space group P21 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit), which allowed us to determine the structure at 1.69-Å resolution (Table 1). The structural studies were complemented by urea denaturation studies to determine the effects of mutation on the thermodynamic stability of the protein (Table 2, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).

are two of the five most frequent cancer-associated mutations. They affect Arg-273, which makes major contacts with the phosphate backbone of target DNA. Having previously solved the crystal structure of T-p53C-R273H (16), we have now determined the structure of T-p53C-R273C (at 1.8-Å resolution) to elucidate the structural changes in the cysteine variant. Overall, the structures of T-p53C, T-p53C-R273H, and T-p53CR273C are virtually identical. A pairwise superposition of the C atoms from equivalent chains gives rmsds of 0.16 Å. The R273C mutation simply removed a DNA contact without perturbing the conformation of neighboring residues, such as Phe134 and Asp-281 (Fig. 2). The preservation of the overall architecture of the DNA-binding surface in the structures of T-p53C-R273C and T-p53C-R273H explains why these mutants exhibit residual DNA-binding activity despite the loss of a crucial DNA contact (ref. 18 and unpublished data).
G245S Induces Small Conformational Changes in the L3 Loop. The G245S mutation is located in the L3 loop, which binds to the minor groove of DNA response elements via Arg-248 (Fig. 1). The crystal structure of T-p53C-G245S revealed distinct strucJoerger et al.

tural changes in the immediate environment of the mutation site. Observed conformational changes in some surface loops (e.g., in the L1 loop and the S7­S8 loop) can be attributed to differences in crystallization conditions and crystal packing for T-p53C and T-p53C-G245S and ref lect the intrinsic conformational f lexibility of these loop regions (12, 17, 19). In T-p53C-G245S, the hydroxyl group of Ser-245 points toward the zinc ligands Cys-238 and Cys-242 and displaces a structural water molecule that is observed in the wild-type and various mutant structures (Fig. 3A). The main-chain atoms of Ser-245 form the same hydrogen bonds with neighboring residues (Cys-242 and the side chain of Arg-249) as observed for the glycine in the wild type and T-p53C, although the backbone conformation of Ser-245 is slightly different. Both dihedral angles and have changed by 20° and fall within a ``generously allowed'' region of the Ramachandran plot ( 102°). As such, Ser-245 adopts a moderately 141°, unfavorable main-chain conformation. Most interestingly, the mutation appears to trigger a flip of the peptide bond between Met-243 and Gly-244, resulting in a displacement of the corresponding C atoms by 0.7 and 1.7 Å, respectively. This peptide flip relative to the conformation found in the structures of T-p53C and DNA-bound wild type was observed in all four molecules of the asymmetric unit. There is also a significant structural response from Pro-177, which follows the movement of Gly-244 to avoid steric clashes and is shifted to a similar extent. The backbone conformation of residues 246­ 250 of the L3 loop, which includes the DNA-contact residue Arg-248, is only marginally affected, and their C displacements are in the 0.5-Å range. Some of the residues with the most significant shifts in their C atoms (Met-243, Gly-244, and Pro-177), however, are key residues in the subunit interface of the core domain dimer bound to a DNA half-site (10, 20, 21). (Fig. 3C). Although the G245S mutation has no major direct effect on the DNA-contact residue Arg-248 in the DNA-free form of T-p53C-G245S, it presumably puts conformational strain on the subunit interface upon DNA binding. Such effects on the subunit interface would explain DNA-binding studies on fulllength T-p53-G245S, which show that specific binding to the gadd45 response element is 15-fold reduced relative to T-p53 at physiological ionic strength (18). In contrast, R249S, the other structural cancer hotspot mutation in the L3 loop, substantially

perturbs the L3 loop, induces high flexibility, and favors alternative conformations with much more severe consequences for the overall protein stability and DNA binding (16, 18). Hence, for these two structural hotspot mutations in the L3 loop, there is a direct correlation between the magnitude of loss of DNA binding and the extent of the observed structural perturbation. Our structures also explain interactions of p53 mutants with other proteins, such as the apoptosis-stimulating protein ASPP2. Under conditions where the mutants are fully folded, several cancer mutants bind to the 53BP2 domain of the ASPP2 protein at wild-type levels, whereas no binding is detected for the mutants T-p53C-R249S and T-p53C-G245S, which have distinct structural changes in the region that forms the central part of the p53­53BP2 interface (22).
The R282W Mutation Affects the Packing of the Loop­Sheet­Helix Motif. Arg-282 plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural

integrity of the loop­sheet­ helix motif that binds to the major groove of DNA target sites (Fig. 1). Its side chain is involved in a network of interactions that pack helix H2 against the S2­S2 -hairpin and loop L1 (Fig. 3B). The 1.6-Å crystal structure of T-p53C-R282W revealed that the overall fold of the protein is not compromised by the R282W hotspot mutation. The C atoms of T-p53C-R282W and T-p53C can be superimposed with a rmsd of 0.26 Å. There are, however, substantial structural perturbations in the loop­sheet­ helix motif (Fig. 3B), and several stabilizing interactions are lost, which accounts for the loss of thermodynamic stability of 3 kcal mol. The region of the L1 loop next to Trp-282 is disordered because of steric hindrance, and no conclusive electron density was observed for several residues within this loop (residues 117­121, including the DNA contact Lys-120).
15058 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0607286103

As such, Trp-282 displaces what appears to be the weakest structural link in the loop­sheet­ helix motif. The side chain of Trp-282 is solvent-exposed and much less well embedded within the protein structure than the arginine in T-p53C. The destabilization of the loop­sheet­ helix motif is also ref lected in the B factor profile, which shows an increased mobility for the main-chain atoms at both ends of the chain break in loop L1 and around the mutation site in the C-terminal helix, and this trend is propagated toward the chain end (Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The overall packing characteristics of the C-terminal helix containing the DNA-contact residues Cys-277 and Arg-280 against the core of the protein, however, are preserved. Hence, at the subphysiological temperatures at which the mutant R282W is largely folded, it is still able to bind gadd45 DNA (14) despite the structural disorder in the L1 loop containing the DNA-contact residue Lys-120. This retention of binding activity is consistent with a recent mutational analysis of the L1 loop (23) and with the observation that this loop is a mutational ``cold spot'' that is only rarely mutated in human cancer (3), indicating that structural perturbations in the L1 loop are tolerated to a certain degree without abrogating p53 function.

the DNA-binding surface (compare release R10 of the TP53 mutation database at www-p53.iarc.fr) (3). It is located at the far end of the -sandwich, at the start of the loop connecting -strands S7 and S8 (Fig. 1) and destabilizes the core domain by 4 kcal mol (Table 2).

T-p53C-Y220C showed that the Y220C mutation creates a solvent-accessible cleft that is filled with water molecules at defined positions but leaves the overall structure of the core domain intact (Fig. 4). The structural changes upon mutation link two rather shallow surface clefts, preexisting in the wild type, to form a long, extended crevice in T-p53C-Y220C, which has its deepest point at the mutation site (Fig. 4 B and C). Cys-220 occupies approximately the position of the equivalent atoms of Tyr-220 in the wild type. The positions of neighboring hydrophobic side chains located in the core of the -sandwich have not shifted significantly. The mutation, however, results in a loss of hydrophobic interactions and a suboptimal packing of these hydrophobic core residues. The side chain of Leu-145, which was buried in the wild type, for instance, becomes partly solvent accessible in T-p53C-Y220C. The largest structural changes in the immediate environment of the mutation site are found in the S7­S8 loop for Pro-222. Throughout the structure, there is no C displacement 0.9 Å.
-Sandwich Mutations and the Molecular Basis of Temperature Sensitivity. About one-third of the reported cancer mutations in

the p53 core domain are located outside the structural elements that form the DNA-binding surface (loops L2 and L3 and the loop­sheet­ helix motif). The V143A mutant is of particular interest because of the well documented temperature sensitivity of its binding to many response elements in both yeast and mammalian systems. At body temperature, the mutant is inactive and unfolded, whereas it retains transactivational activity at lower temperatures (24, 25). The structures of T-p53C-V143A and T-p53C-F270L provide the molecular basis for understanding the temperature-sensitive behavior of many -sandwich mutants. Both mutations created internal

cavities in the hydrophobic core of the -sandwich without collapse of the surrounding structure (Fig. 5). The cavity volume was 47 Å3 (T-p53C-V143A) and 51 Å3 (T-p53CF270L), as defined by the volume that can be occupied by a probe mimicking the size of a water molecule (1.4-Å probe radius). Additional information on these cavities is provided in Table 3, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site. In agreement with the hydrophobic nature of the cavities, no ordered buried water molecules were detected in the crystal structure. Although the overall structure of the core domain was perfectly conserved, the creation of void volumes came at a high energetic cost of 3.7 and 4.1 kcal mol. These observations are consistent with studies on ``large-tosmall'' substitutions in the hydrophobic core of T4-lysozyme and barnase (26 ­28). A recent study has identified a large number of temperaturesensitive p53 mutants (29). Most mutations were clustered in the -sheet region of the protein, and the substitutions were mainly from large hydrophobic residues to smaller hydrophobic residues. Incidentally, V143A was not detected in this study, whereas mutations at residue 270 were (F270I and F270C). Interestingly, the Y220C mutation has also been reported to cause temperature-sensitive behavior (25). Again, this behavior is in agreement with our crystallographic data, which show that the mutation-induced structural changes are very localized, far away from the DNA-binding surface. A common structural feature of the -sandwich mutants seemed to be that there were only minor structural disruptions upon mutation, although the effect on the thermodynamic stability of the protein was generally more severe than for the hotspot mutations in the DNAbinding surface. The much more compact and robust structural framework of the -sandwich compared with the zinc-binding region and the loop­sheet­helix motif renders it generally much less susceptible to mutation-induced structural changes, in particular for large-to-small substitutions. The absence of structural

changes in surface regions, especially in the DNA-binding surface, however, is key for functionality. Hence, temperaturesensitive behavior can be expected for all cancer mutations that destabilize the core domain without compromising the surface complementarity that is crucial to the function of p53, not only for binding to specific promoter sequences but also for interactions with regulatory proteins and for correct domain organization in tetrameric full-length p53 (9, 30­33).
Implications for Rescue Strategies. At first glance, the discussion of the local structural changes induced by highly destabilizing mutations appears to be rather academic when assessing the functional consequences under physiological conditions, because these mutant proteins will most likely be largely unfolded. Our structural observations, however, have profound implications for therapeutic strategies that aim to rescue the function of p53 with small-molecule drugs that stabilize p53 (reviewed in refs. 34 and 35). The mutations N239Y and N268D have been reported to restore transcriptional activity in a subset of cancer mutants, including G245S (36). Double-mutant cycles suggest that they act as global stability suppressors (37). As such, they mimic the effects of a hypothetical generic small-molecule drug. The structure of T-p53C-G245S, however, exhibits distinct structural perturbations despite the presence of these stabilizing suppressor mutations, concomitant with altered functional properties (e.g., impaired binding of 53BP2; see above). For mutants with local structural changes in the DNA-binding surface, simple stabilization by means of a generic small molecule may not be enough to fully restore activity. A prime example is the mutant R249S. Studies on second-site suppressor mutations have shown that full restoration of DNA-binding activity is found only in the presence of a mutation (H168R) that specifically reverses the structural changes induced by the oncogenic mutation (16, 36, 37). On the basis of our structural studies, -sandwich mutants, such as V143A and F270L, represent much more promising targets for rescue by generic small-molecule drugs, because, in this case, stabilizing the wild-type conformation of the protein by ligand binding may be sufficient to restore wild-type-like activity under physiological conditions. The Y220C mutant not only has the potential of being rescued by a generic wild-type-binding compound but also has the possibility of being a target for a mutant-selective drug that can bind in the crevice formed by the deletion (Fig. 4C). This crevice region is particularly attractive because it appears to be distant from the functional sites and interfaces of the protein.

tional proteins at pivotal cellular checkpoints, as also observed in the case of the tumor suppressor protein p16, for example (40). Such knowledge combined with more structural data on the effect of mutations would significantly improve predictions as to whether nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms are benign or likely to cause functional disorders. Conclusion Our crystallographic studies paint an intriguing picture of the effects of p53 cancer mutations. They clearly show that the mutations result in a variety of characteristic structural changes, concomitant with distinct energetic responses, although the overall structural framework is largely conserved. Accordingly, general conclusions about ``mutant p53'' based on the results obtained for one particular mutant have to be treated with caution. Two aspects have to be considered when rationalizing functional properties of a particular cancer mutant, even though there is a direct causal connection between the two: (i) the effect of mutation on the overall thermodynamic stability of the protein and (ii) the nature of local conformational changes. The effects on thermodynamic stability will determine whether a mutant is folded at a particular temperature. Whether a mutant is functional in the folded state, however, depends on the extent and nature of the structural changes, in particular in the DNAbinding surface, which will eventually determine the selectivity for various response elements or the interactions with other proteins, such as apoptotic cofactors. Recent studies in yeast and mammalian cell lines have shown that different mutants exhibit distinct transactivation patterns that are directly connected with different phenotypes (41, 42). More importantly, a study involving breast cancer patients suggested that different p53 mutations are associated with different prognostic values (43). These observations highlight the need for a thorough understanding of the mutation­structure and structure­function relationship in p53 so that biological outcome and response to drug treatment can be predicted. The details of individual structures point toward the possibility of designing specific drugs to bind to them and stabilize the native conformation. Materials and Methods
Mutagenesis and Protein Purification. Mutagenesis, gene expres-

sion, and protein purification were performed as described in ref. 16, with a modification for T-p53C-G245S, for which a shortened construct comprising residues 94­293 (instead of 94­312) was used. After the final purification step (gel filtration), the mutant proteins were concentrated to 6­7 mg ml, flash-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen.
Equilibrium Denaturation. Urea denaturation studies were performed as described in ref. 16 by using the equations described in ref. 14 for data analysis. Crystallization and Structure Determination. All crystals were grown at 17°C by using the sitting drop vapor-diffusion technique. Crystals of T-p53C-V143A, T-p53C-Y220C, T-p53C-F270L, and T-p53C-R282W were grown under the conditions described for T-p53C (17); crystals of T-p53C-R273C were grown under the conditions described for T-p53C-R273H (16). Crystals of T-p53C-G245S were grown by mixing 2 l of protein solution (6 mg ml) with 0.4 l of water and 1.6 l of the reservoir solution (19% polyethylene glycol 3350 0.19 M calcium acetate, pH 7.2). Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen by using mother liquor with either 20% polyethylene glycol 200 or 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. X-ray data sets were collected at 100 K on beamlines 10.1 and 14.1 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, U.K.). Data processing was performed by using Mosflm (44) and Scala (45). All crystals except T-p53C-G245S belonged to space group P212121 with two molecules per asymJoerger et al.

20% of common nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms result in amino acid changes that damage the corresponding protein, resulting in 2,000 potentially deleterious alleles in the average human genotype (38). The structural and energetic response of the p53 core domain to the V143A and F270L mutations in the hydrophobic core of the -sandwich suggests that this type of mutation results in deleterious phenotypes mainly because p53 is only marginally stable at body temperature. Equivalent mutations in a more stable structural scaffold may have only subtle effects on function and result in rather neutral phenotypes. There is growing evidence that p53 has evolved to be highly dynamic and intrinsically unstable (12, 19, 39). As a negative side effect of this evolutionary process, the core domain of p53 has in a way become more susceptible to cancer-associated mutations in the -sandwich. To our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive quantitative study on the stability of human proteins. It would be interesting to address the question of whether the low intrinsic thermodynamic stability of p53 is the exception or a common feature of highly regulated multifunc15060 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0607286103

After an initial round of rigid-body refinement using the structure of either T-p53C (PDB ID code 1UOL) or T-p53C-R273H (PDB ID code 2BIM) as a starting model, the structures were refined by iterative cycles of refinement with CNS and manual model-building with MAIN (47). Crystals of T-p53C-G245S belonged to space group P21 with four molecules per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with CNS using T-p53C as a search model. Subsequent refinement was performed as described above for the other mutants. The final models (1.6- to 1.8-Å resolution) had a crystallographic R factor of 18.3­19.8% (Rfree 20.6­22.3%) and excellent stereochemistry as verified with PROCHECK (48). Detailed data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.
Structure Analysis. Unless otherwise stated, detailed descriptions of mutant structures are based on the comparison of molecule A of a particular mutant with molecule A of T-p53C. Numbering

of secondary structure elements is as reported for the wild-type structure in complex with DNA (5) [e.g., loop L2 comprises residues 164­194, including a short helix (H1)]. Depending on the program used to assign secondary structure, the -turn region at the beginning of the L2 loop is sometimes alternatively assigned as a short 310-helix. Volumes of internal cavities were calculated with VOIDOO (49) by using different probe sizes (1.4- and 1.2-Å radius). Calculations were performed for 10 random orientations of the molecule. The cavity refinement parameters were as described in ref. 28. Structural figures were prepared by using MOLSCRIPT (50), RASTER3D (51), and SYBYL 6.9 (Tripos, St. Louis, MO).
