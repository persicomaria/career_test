Abstract We describe a simple and effective procedure to isolate antifreeze proteins (AFPs) from the hemolymph of larvae of the longhorn beetle Rhagium inquisitor, and present some characteristics of their structures. Several AFPs were isolated from the hemolymph of this species by heat and acid extraction followed by cation exchange. The hemolymph contains at least six AFPs ranging in size from 12.5 to 12.8 kDa. Of these, three were separated to purity by the ion exchange step, as indicated by mass spectrometry. The remaining three forms were further separated by size exclusion chromatography, but could not be isolated to purity. All AFPs in the hemolymph of this species appears to have isoelectric points above 8.00. The dominant form, RiAFPH4, was purified by the ion exchange step. Its amino acid composition reveals a lower level of cysteine and a higher level of threonine, arginine, alanine and glycine than seen in other insect AFPs. Its trypsin fingerprint does not match that of any known protein. It interacts with ice both in the anionic and cationic state. D 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Many freeze avoiding animals have so-called antifreeze proteins (AFPs) in their body fluids as a component of their adaptation to low temperature. AFPs are characterised by their capacity to prevent the growth of ice in solution. Five structural classes of AFPs have been identified among the hyposmotic fish inhabiting ice-laden polar waters (Ewart et al., 1999). AFPs have also been found in a variety of terrestrial arthropods, including about 50 species of insects (Duman et al., 2004). The separation of the melting and freezing temperature of ice caused by AFPs is referred to as thermal hysteresis. Upon sufficient cooling, however, a sudden rapid ice growth is initiated. This temperature is referred to as the

hysteresis freezing point. The difference between the melting and freezing temperature is called the hysteresis activity or antifreeze activity. Typical antifreeze activity in body fluids from insects is 4­ 7 -C in the coldest part of the winter. The experimentally determined antifreeze activity of insect body fluids is far less than their supercooling capacity (25 ­ 30 -C). The observed antifreeze activity in the presence of insect AFPs increases with decreasing crystal size used in the experiment (Zachariassen and Husby, 1982; Hansen and Baust, 1988; Duman and Serianni, 2002). Extrapolation of this relationship shows that the antifreeze activity would correspond to the supercooling range of the insect at a crystal size corresponding to the critical size for nucleation at the supercooling point of the animal (Zachariassen and Husby, 1982). Thus, insect AFPs may function over the entire supercooling range of the animal. The antifreeze activity is assumed to reflect the role of AFPs as stabilisers of supercooled body fluids. Insects may

become inoculated by external ice penetrating the body surface. AFPs from the freeze avoiding beetles Dendroides canadensis and Ips acuminatus have been shown to inhibit inoculative freezing (Olsen et al., 1998; Gehrken, 1992). In addition, body fluids may contain compounds that incidentally act as catalysts for the growth of ice, so-called ice nucleators. AFPs from D. canadensis have been shown to inhibit ice nucleator activity (Olsen and Duman, 1997; Duman, 2002). The cerambycid beetle Rhagium inquisitor is distributed throughout Europe as well as in the extremely cold parts of Siberia and Alaska. It spends the winter under the bark of dead spruce and pine and may supercool to well below À 30 -C (Gehrken, 1992). Its body fluids express antifreeze activity of 4 ­7 -C in the winter (Gehrken, 1992). This species belongs to Chrysomeloidea, a superfamily different from that of the heteromerous beetles from which the primary structure of antifreeze proteins has previously been described. The purpose of this investigation was to develop a procedure to isolate AFPs from the hemolymph of this beetle without appreciable loss of AFPs and to make some initial characterisations of their structure.

2.2.2. Hemolymph sampling A small hole was cut on the left side of the frontal prothorax region of the larvae with a pair of surgical scissors. The attenuated end of a flame drawn capillary tube was then used to collect the exuding hemolymph by means of the capillary force. Each capillary tube was then separately placed in a small hole in the lid of a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing approximately 200 AL of liquid paraffin oil. Brief centrifugation at low speed left the hemolymph at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube, isolated from the air by the less dense paraffin oil. The microcentrifuge tube was kept on ice between centrifugations, and 1 mL hemolymph could be obtained for every ¨50 larvae processed in this way. The hemolymph was stored frozen at À 35 -C. 2.3. AFP separation 2.3.1. Pre-treatment Hemolymph (1 mL) was diluted 1 : 2 in distilled water and heated at 70 -C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min, and an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added. After brief mixing the sample was centrifuged a second time at 10,000 g for 5 min and the supernatant was collected. By addition of a volume of 1 M Tris base equal to half that of the supernatant, the pH was raised from approximately 1.5 to 7. The sample was subsequently dialyzed for 12 h against distilled water at 4 -C. 2.3.2. Ion exchange The dialysate from the pre-treatment procedures (¨5 mL) was diluted ten times in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.00 and applied on a cation column at room temperature by the use of a peristaltic pump. A linear 0 ­ 125 mM NaCl gradient was applied at a flow rate of 1 mL/min while the absorbance was recorded at 214 nm. The eluate was collected in 80 fractions each of 1.2 mL. The column was regenerated with 1 M NaCl. The fractions were subsequently frozen and freeze-dried over night. Both the ¨50 mL solution that passed through the column during sample application (application volume) and the ¨3 mL regeneration volume of 1 M NaCl were collected. The regeneration volume was dialyzed for 6 h and freeze-dried. The application volume was freeze-dried to reduce its volume, redissolved in 2 mL distilled water, dialyzed for 6 h and then freeze-dried a second time. Successive fractions that formed distinct groups based on their antifreeze activity were pooled and stored at À 35 -C. 2.3.3. Size exclusion chromatography The differently pooled fractions from the ion exchange procedure (¨1 mL) were further separated by size exclusion chromatography with a running buffer of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.00, containing 250 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and the eluate was collected in fractions each of 1 mL. Fractions were

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials All dialysis was conducted using Spectra/Por\ 6 dialysis membrane (Spectrum laboratories) with 1 kDa cut-off. The membrane was washed extensively in distilled water (18 Mohm/cm) prior to use. 1 mL prepacked high performance (HP) ion exchange columns (Amersham/Pharmacia) were used for both cation exchange (SP) and anion exchange (Q). Size exclusion was performed using a C 10/40 column (Amersham/ Pharmacia) loaded with preparative grade Superdex 30, separation range 10­ 1 kDa (Amersham/Pharmacia). All fractions during separation procedures were collected in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. The high pI kit (Amersham/Pharmacia) was used as standard during chromatofocusing. Buffers used: pH 3­ 6: Citric acid monohydrate was mixed with disodium hydrogen phosphate. pH 7­ 9: Tris base was mixed with Tris ­ HCl. pH 10­ 12: Sodium phosphate monobasic was mixed with trisodium phosphate 12-hydrate. 2.2. Collection of larvae and hemolymph sampling 2.2.1. Collection Cold-hardy larvae of R. inquisitor were collected from their hibernation sites under the bark of dead spruce and pine in the vicinity of Trondheim, Norway, in Jan ­Feb, 2003. The larvae were kept in darkness at 4 -C for up to 24 h prior to sampling.

subsequently dialyzed for 6 h and the dialysate were freezedried over night. All freeze-dried samples were subsequently redissolved and examined for presence of antifreeze activity (see below). Fractions that expressed antifreeze activity were pooled and stored at À 35 -C. 2.4. Determination of antifreeze activity Antifreeze activity was measured on a Clifton nanolitre osmometer in which a small liquid volume (¨20 nL) is placed into sample wells pre-filled with paraffin oil. The samples were observed through a microscope while the temperature was controlled within 0.00186 -C, i.e. 1 mOsm. The samples were frozen by rapid cooling to À 40 -C, heated to a pre-set temperature somewhat below the expected melting point and then slowly heated (¨0.5 -C/ min) until only a tiny crystal was left in the sample. The crystal was visibly observed to obtain similarly sized crystals between different runs. The crystal was allowed to stabilize for ¨1 min before the temperature was slowly lowered (¨1 -C/min). The antifreeze activity was determined as the difference between the temperature at which the crystal was stabilized and the temperature of rapid ice growth. The freeze-dried fractions and the regeneration volume following cation exchange were redissolved in 100 AL of distilled water whereas the application volume was redissolved in 200 AL distilled water prior to determining the antifreeze activity. The hysteresis freezing point of fraction 44 ­47 from the cation exchange was below the measuring limit of the Clifton osmometer (À 9.3 -C, i.e. 5000 mOsm). These fractions were diluted 1 : 2 prior to determining the antifreeze activity. The antifreeze activity prior to dilution was then estimated from the equation describing the antifreeze activity ( Y) as a function of the relative concentration of AFPs (x): À Á Y ¼ 1:5863 ln ð xÞ þ 5:9545 R2 ¼ 0:9855 The dialyzed and freeze-dried fractions from the size exclusion step were redissolved in 20 or 100 AL of distilled water. 2.5. Mass spectrometry Freeze dried dialysates were resuspended in 50 AL distilled water (milli-Q), and 0.5 AL of this solution was mixed into 0.5 AL sinaminic acid solution (1.5 mg/mL) containing 1 / 1 (v/v) water-acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA on a sample plate, and allowed to dry at room temperature. The samples were ionized by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (Maldi) and separated on the basis of their mass to charge ratio (m / z) by their time of flight (ToF) in a charged field (Bruker Reflex IV, Daltonics). Ionization occurred in dry nitrogen at 337 nm at a pulse of 20 Hz. ToF was determined in linear mode with a 20 kV acceleration voltage, and 17.9 kV secondary grid voltage.

The resulting mass-spectra for the different samples after the Maldi­ ToF procedure showed several distinct peaks, all simple numerical derivatives of each other. It could not be determined which peak represented the mono-charged species, and thus signaled the correct mass of that AFP, or if there were several components within the sample. The signal representing the monocharged species was subsequently determined by generating a number of differently charged species by electron spray ionization (ESI) in a LC ­ MS and allowing an algorithm to calculate the mass that represents the singularly charged species. 2.6. Characterization The most abundant form, RiAFPH4, was selected for further characterisation. 2.6.1. Determining the number of cysteine residues Internal disulfide bonds were reduced by incubating aliquots of approximately 50 Ag RiAFPH4 in 10 mM DTT in 25 mM NH4CO3 at 56 -C for 45 min. The reduced disulfide bonds were alkylated by incubating the solution in 55 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min at 20 -C. This procedure results in a mass increase of 57 Da for every cysteine residue alkylated. The masses of the native and the reduced and alkylated protein were determined by Maldi ­ ToF, as described above. 2.6.2. Trypsin fingerprint Aliquots of approximately 50 Ag RiAFPH4 were digested with 2 Ag trypsin in 50 mM acetic acid for 12­ 18 h at 37 -C. Both native protein and protein following reduction and alkylation was used. A 0.5 AL of the digest solution was then mixed with 0.5 AL a-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnaminic acid (5 mg/mL) in 1/1 (v/v) water-acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA on a sample plate, and allowed to dry at room temperature. The different peptide fragments were ionized and separated on the basis of their mass to charge ratio (m / z) by Maldi­ToF as described above with the exceptions that ToF was determined in reflector mode with a 16.8 kV acceleration voltage, and with 23 kV secondary grid voltage. 2.6.3. Absorbance scan Active fractions of the RiAFPH4 after size exclusion chromatography were pooled and 500 AL of this solution was scanned from 190 to 300 nm (LAMBDA 40, Perkin Elmer). This was done to assess purity, the presence of aromatic residues within RiAFPH4 and the correctness of using 214 nm to detect the AFPs. Fractions preceding the void volume of the corresponding size exclusion run were used as reference. 2.6.4. Amino acid composition After complete hydrolysis of the protein in 6N HCl the component amino acids were quantified according to standard procedures. The hydrolysis was carried out in vacuum to

prevent oxidation of cysteine and methionine (Biotechnology Centre of Oslo, University of Oslo, Norway). 2.6.5. Chromatofocusing RiAFPH4 was found to stain poorly with silver. As an alternative to determine its isoelectric point (pI) in ampholyte gels in an electric field, its pI was determined in a pH gradient applied to an ion exchange column, i.e. chromatofocusing. The absorbance scan confirmed that RiAFPH4 showed strong absorbance at 214 nm and consequently could be registered as it eluted off the column at a pH corresponding to its pI. One vial of the protein standards was used, containing three proteins with pI's within the pH range applied; lentil lectin-basic band (pI 8.65), lentil lectin-middle band (pI 8.45) and lentil ­lectin acidic band (pI 8.15). The pooled fractions of RiAFPH4 from the size exclusion procedure following dialysis were diluted ten times in 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 9.00, and applied to an anion column at room temperature by means of a peristaltic pump. A linear pH gradient from 9.00 to 8.00 was applied, generated by mixing 20 mM Tris ­ HCl into 20 mM Tris pH 9.00 at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The absorbance was recorded at 214 nm. The eluate was collected in 80 fractions each of 1.2 mL. The pH of every fifth fraction was measured by placing a microelectrode directly into the fraction. The fractions were subsequently frozen, freeze-dried over night and checked for antifreeze activity. 2.6.6. pH stability The antifreeze activity of RiAFPH4 was measured in the presence of 50 mM buffer solution containing 0.9% NaCl at pH values ranging from 3 to 12 to assess its stability at different pH and study its interaction with ice. Buffers used were McIlvaine buffer (pH 3 ­ 6), Tris buffer (pH 7 ­9) and phosphate buffer (pH 10­ 12).

Fig. 1 shows the absorbance and antifreeze activity in successive fractions obtained from the cation exchange procedure. The fractions expressing antifreeze activity comprised 7 distinct groups, denoted H1 ­ H7. 3.2. Size exclusion chromatography The upper panel of Fig. 2 shows absorbance profiles from the size exclusion chromatography, being the final separation step of the isolation procedure. The lower panel of the figure shows the antifreeze activity of one representative experiment. The figure shows that all AFPs eluted closely behind the void volume. No changes in the absorbance profiles were found between runs when 500 mM NaCl in the buffer was tested, implying that ionic interaction between AFPs and the size exclusion material did not affect the separation. Since the samples applied to the column were not dialysed between the ion exchange and the size exclusion procedure, the applied samples had approximately ten times higher concentration of NaCl and Tris buffer compared to the fractions from the cation exchange procedure (see Miscellaneous, below). Tris absorbs strongly at 214 nm (pers. obs.), and the absorbance peak registered in fraction 22­ 26 is due to the elevated concentration of Tris buffer that elutes at the lower separation limit of the size exclusion material (1 kDa) relative to that of the running buffer. These fractions have a high osmolality due to their high content of NaCl and buffer. As can be seen from Fig. 2A, H2 and H3 from the cation exchange procedure were individually separated into three distinct groups, registered as three distinct absorbance peaks. The antifreeze activity was associated only with the middle absorbance peak. Thus, these activity peaks were purified further. H2 was redissolved in 20 AL distilled water prior to determining antifreeze activity. The absorbance

We have previously shown that the pre-treatment steps of heat and acid extraction of the AFPs from the hemolymph of R. inquisitor cause only a minor reduction in antifreeze activity (Kristiansen et al., 1999). 3.1. Ion exchange No antifreeze activity was found in the eluate that passed through the ion exchange column during sample application at pH 8.00. This indicated that all the heat and acid extractable AFPs from the pre-treatment procedure adsorbed to the column at this pH. Similarly, no antifreeze activity was observed in the 1 M regeneration volume after the cation exchange procedure was terminated, implying that all adsorbed AFPs had been eluted by a concentration of NaCl below 125 mM.

3.4. The number of cysteine residues The mass increase following reduction and alkylation is illustrated in Fig. 3. The mass increase from 12,791 Da to 12,906 Da is only 115 Da, very close to the expected mass increase following alkylation of only two cysteine residues (2 Â 57 Da). Thus, this AFP appears to contain only two cysteine residues. 3.5. Trypsin fingerprint The trypsin fingerprints were different for the native protein and the protein following reduction and alkylation, suggesting the presence of disulfide bonds. These fingerprints were used in an attempt to identify similarity to other proteins by the on-line software PeptIdent and Mowse. No matches with other proteins were obtained. 3.6.

profiles of H4, H5, H6 and H7 (Fig. 2B) shows single absorbance signals that in strength reflect the absorbance recorded in these fractions during the cation exchange procedure. These forms were therefore not purified further by size exclusion chromatography. H4 was redissolved in 100 AL distilled water prior to determining antifreeze activity. Fig. 2C shows that H1 could not be purified further by the size exclusion step. The strong absorbance registered in H1 during the cation exchange procedure (Fig. 1) was disproportionate to the low antifreeze activity. The absorbance profile registered during size exclusion of H1 also consisted of a single peak. H1 was redissolved in 20 AL distilled water prior to determining antifreeze activity. 3.3. Mass determination In the mass spectra of H4 after size exclusion chromatography several signals were present, each a simple numerical of each other. The signal representing the singular species was determined to be 12,791 Da by ESI. The molecular masses in H1 ­ H7 after the size exclusion chromatography are listed in Table 1. H4, H5, H6 and H7 each contain a single mass, suggesting that each peak contains a single purified AFP. These AFPs were therefore probably purified during the cation exchange procedure, since no further purification was apparently achieved from the size exclusion step. The masses present in H4, H5 and H6 are similar. Activity peaks H1, H2 and H3 contained several masses and had not been sufficiently purified by these procedures. Thus, AFPs not purified by the cation exchange procedure (H1 ­ H3) could not be separated to purity by the size exclusion chromatography step.

3.8. Chromatofocusing Fig. 4 shows that the three isoelectric focusing standards used in the procedure eluted off the column at pH values corresponding to their respective pI's. RiAFPH4 eluted at pH ¨8.55, and this pH was consequently interpreted as its pI. The absorbance signal registered when RiAFPH4 eluted was very low compared to the absorbance registered during the cation exchange and size exclusion procedures (Figs. 1 and 2). This, together with the absence of antifreeze activity in the eluate suggested that RiAFPH4 had precipitated at its pI. 3.9. pH stability RiAFPH4 expressed antifreeze activity at pH values ranging from pH 3 to 12 and is consequently stable within this pH range. 3.10. Miscellaneous High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used as a standard purification technique to obtain AFPs from T. molitor, D. canadensis and C. fumiferana (Liou et al., 1999; Wu et al., 1991; Gauthier et al., 1998). This technique was therefore initially applied to isolate AFPs from R. inquisitor. The AFPs were separated in a 0% ­ 50% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% TFA in 80 min on a C-18 column. When running RiAFPH4 several peaks were present in the chromatogram and there were clear tailing of each peak. Following dialysis and freeze drying the loss in antifreeze activity exceeded 95%. There was no improvement of the yield when the acetonitrile was removed from the fractions in dry N2 prior to freeze drying. This procedure was consequently abandoned. According to the manual many proteins lose their tertiary structure during the HPLC procedure, and this seems to be the case with RiAFPH4. Extensive dialysis after the ion exchange and size exclusion procedures caused severe loss of antifreeze

representative AFPs from the beetles D. canadensis and Tenebrio molitor and the moth spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana. This procedure gives only approximate results. Assuming that the amino acid of lowest abundance is represented only once in the sequence (His and Tyr), the combined mass of the identified amino acids is 12,839 Da. The similarity between this combined mass and the experimentally determined mass of 12,791 Da therefore reinforce the assumption that H4 contain a single and pure AFP. From the amount of the different amino acids in the sample and the MW of the AFP we estimated that 1 mL native hemolymph with moderate antifreeze activity (4.65 -C) contains ¨0.2 mg of RiAFPH4. 3.7. Absorbance scan The absorbance profile obtained when the RiAFPH4 was scanned from 190­ 300 nm showed a maximum at 206 nm, corresponding to absmax of the peptide bond. The absorbance was quite strong at 214 nm, confirming that this wavelength is also appropriate to detect AFPs from this species, and virtually absent above 230 nm. The profile was smooth with no secondary absorbance peaks, suggesting that the sample contained protein with low content of aromatic amino acids (abs max 280 nm). This is in accordance with its determined amino acid composition (Table 2), that suggests the presence of only 3 residues with aromatic sidechains, two phenylalanines and one tyrosine.

activity. Consequently, dialysis was kept to a minimum, both in terms of the number of dialysis steps and the duration of each such step. The different fractions of 1.2 mL from the ion exchange procedure were therefore not dialysed prior to measuring the antifreeze activity. Consequently, redissolving the freeze dried samples in 100 AL distilled water caused the concentration of buffer and NaCl in these samples to be twelve times that during elution from the ion exchange column. The osmolalities in consecutive samples therefore changed in a linear fashion from ¨200 mOsm in fraction 1 to ¨3000 mOsm in fraction 80. The high content of NaCl in these fractions did not appear to affect the antifreeze activity. The antifreeze activity disappears when the volatile buffer ammonium bicarbonate is present during freeze drying. A similar effect was reported by Li et al. (1998a), when adding sodium sulfate to a solution of AFPs from D. canadensis. The cause of this effect is unknown.

4. Discussion A number of AFP isoforms are present in each of the insect species previously examined. Andorfer and Duman (2000) found that D. canadensis expresses some 13 AFP isoforms. Similar studies conducted on T. molitor (Liou et al., 1999) and C. fumiferana (Doucet et al., 2002) have resulted in the identification of some 12 and 13 isoforms, respectively. These studies were based on cDNA screening and consequently represent the forms within the whole organism. The AFPs of D. canadensis have a specific pattern of distribution between body fluid compartments (Duman et al., 2002), where only 4 of the isoforms are located in the hemolymph. This investigation shows that 4 of the 7 distinct activity peaks obtained from the cation exchange appear to exist in pure form (H4 ­ H7). H4 ­H6 contain almost identical masses, and it is unknown if these are different forms or if their separation is a consequence of a structural misfolding of a single form, possibly occurring during the pre-treatment procedure. Since each of the remaining activity peaks H1 ­H3 contained masses distinct to that peak, each peak probably contained different forms. Hence, there seem to be at least 6 AFP forms in the hemolymph of R. inquisitor, and there are probably other forms in other body fluid compartments. Kristiansen et al. (1999) showed that the gut fluid and extracts of the muscle tissue also express antifreeze activity in this species. The absence of absorbance at 280 nm suggests that RiAFPH4 contain low levels of aromatic amino acids. This is consistent with the determined amino acid composition (Table 2). Schneppenheim and Theede (1980) and Gauthier et al. (1998) used 280 nm when isolating AFPs from T. molitor and C. fumiferana, respectively, while Wu et al. (1991) used 230 nm when isolating AFPs from D. canadensis. Since RiAFPH4 does not absorb at wavelengths

appreciably above 230 nm these wavelengths are inappropriate for detecting AFPs from this species. Liou et al. (1999) reported that some of the isoforms in T. molitor were glycosylated. The mass of RiAFPH4 is accounted for by the approximate mass of its component amino acids. It is therefore concluded that this AFP is not glycosylated. As can be seen from Fig. 3 and Table 2, RiAFPH4 apparently contains only 2 cysteines. Those of the beetles T. molitor and D. canadensis contain ¨20% cysteine whereas those of C. fumiferana contain ¨10% cysteine. All of these cysteine residues form internal disulfide bonds in a regular pattern (Gauthier et al., 1998; Li et al., 1998b). These bonds are assumed to assist in the tight structural folding of these AFPs (Gauthier et al., 1998; Liou et al., 2000). The great loss of antifreeze activity during the HPLC procedure seen for RiAFPH4 compared to that of other insect AFPs, may be due to the absence of multiple disulfide bonds. It has been suggested that the disulphide bonds of insect AFPs also prevent structural unfolding at low temperatures (Gauthier et al., 1998, Graether and Sykes, 2004). If this is the case then a structurally different solution must be contained within RiAFPH4. As can be seen from Table 2, threonine is the most abundant amino acid in the insect AFPs. The native structure of two insect AFPs has been determined. In these the ice binding site is made up of a stack of 5­ 8 TXT motifs (T is threonine and X is usually cysteine) that forms a flat h-sheet on one side of the protein. The oxygen atoms of the exposed hydroxyl groups of these threonines together with those of externally bound water molecules show an almost perfect match to oxygen atoms within the ice lattice (Liou et al., 2000; Graether et al., 2000). The content of threonine in RiAFPH4 exceeds that of the other AFPs. This may reflect a greater potential to interact with the ice and/or to form internal hydrogen bonds as an alternative to the disulfide bonds within other insect AFPs. The latter explanation may also explain its higher content of glycine and arginine. All AFPs that adsorbed to the cation column at pH 8.0 have isoelectric points (pI) above 8. The pI's of the different AFPs in H1 ­H7 probably are quite similar, since they all elute at low salt concentrations (35 ­ 110 mM NaCl). The cause of this apparent uniformity in net charge between them is unknown. There may be structural limitations in amino acid composition that unavoidably result in these pI's. The pH of the native hemolymph is 6.73. Thus, all AFPs in the hemolymph are apparently cationic in vivo. When separating AFPs from D. canadensis, Wu et al. (1991) used anion exchange at pH 9.00. The antifreeze activity was registered at salt concentrations less than 50 mM NaCl, suggesting that these AFPs have pI's similar to those of R. inquisitor. Chao et al. (1996) showed that fish AFP type III expressed antifreeze activity within the pH range 2­ 12. Since the antifreeze activity was observed within this wide

pH interval, they concluded that the AFP ­ ice interaction does not depend on charged residues within the AFP. This was also observed for an AFP from C. fumiferana (Gauthier et al., 1998) and D. canadensis (Wu et al., 1991). RiAFPH4 expressed antifreeze activity at pH values from 3 ­12 and is therefore also structurally stable within this pH range. Since the pI of RiAFPH4 is ¨8.55 (Fig. 4), it interacts with the ice both when cationic (pH below 8.55) and anionic (pH above 8.55). The interaction between RiAFPH4 and ice is therefore independent of charge. Extensive studies on fish type I AFP suggest that the AFP ­ ice interaction primarily rely on hydrophobic forces (Chao et al., 1997; Haymet et al., 1999). RiAFPH4 apparently precipitated at its pI, suggesting that an overall net charge is important either for its structural integrity or to avoid aggregation of these AFPs. The intention of this investigation was to develop a simple procedure to purify AFPs from the hemolymph of R. inquisitor without significant loss of antifreeze activity. The results show that several hemolymph AFPs may be obtained in a single gradient separation procedure by cation exchange after heat and acid extraction, without appreciable loss. All hemolymph AFPs present were separated by the procedure. The results show that the dominant AFP form in the hemolymph of R. inquisitor contains only two cysteine residues, in contrast to the high content of cysteine found in other AFPs. Hence, this AFP, found in a species from the superfamily Chrysomeloidea, seems to be quite different from those found in the heteromerous beetles T. molitor and D. canadensis.
