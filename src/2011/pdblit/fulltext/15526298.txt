ABSTRACT Dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (DCK) catalyzes phosphorylation in the final step of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. In this phosphorylation process, domain movements play a very important role. To reveal the structural changes induced by ligand binding, we determined the crystal structure of DCK from Thermus thermophilus HB8 by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method at 2.8 Å. The crystal structure includes three independent protein molecules in the asymmetric unit: One is a liganded form and the others are unliganded. The topology shows a canonical nucleotide-binding protein possessing the P-loop motif. A structure homology search by DALI revealed the similarity of the DCKs from T. thermophilus HB8, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Structural comparisons between the liganded and unliganded forms of DCK from T. thermophilus HB8 indicated domain movements induced by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. For the domain movements, proline residues confer flexibility at the domain linkages. In particular, Pro91 plays an important role in moving the CoA domain. Proteins 2005;58:235­242.

HB8 possesses the Walker A motif,5 which is highly conserved in many nucleotide binding proteins. In many kinase structures, the ligand(s) are thought to induce structural changes to protect the active site from the omnipresent water.6 This type of structural change probably also plays an important role in DCKs. Therefore, revealing these domain movements will contribute remarkably toward understanding the biological functions of DCKs. A comparison of the DCKs from different genetic sources is not sufficient to identify the amino acids that are responsible for the domain movements, although it provides important information about the domain actions.2,3 We now report the crystal structure of DCK from T. thermophilus, which contains 3 monomers in the asymmetric unit. Direct structural comparisons among the monomers, composed of either unliganded or ATP-bound forms, have been conducted to investigate the DCK domain movements. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Purification The DCK gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the T. thermophilus HB8 genome and subcloned into the NdeI and BglII sites of pT7Blue (Novagen). The plasmid was digested by NdeI and BglII, and the resulting DNA fragment containing the DCK gene was subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET11a (Novagen). The expression plasmid was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli B834(DE3). The cells were grown at 37°C for a few hours. The preculture was inoculated with a dilution ratio of 1:100 into LeMaster medium7 containing selenomethionine (SeMet) and lactose, and cultured overnight at 37°C. After disruption of the cells by sonication, the lysate was ultracentrifuged (200,000 g) at 4°C for 60 min. Ammonium

Key words: kinase; ATP binding; structural change; crystal structure INTRODUCTION Dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (DCK) acts in the final step of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis from pantothenate.1 This enzyme phosphorylates the 3 -hydroxyl group of the ribose in dephosphocoenzyme A (dCoA) to yield the final product, CoA. Recently, two DCK structures, from Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, were reported.2,3 The crystal structure of DCK from H. influenzae includes an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule at the active site. In contrast, the DCK structure from E. coli is a trimer of unliganded monomers. DCK from Thermus thermophilus HB8 is 203 amino acids long, with a molecular mass of 22.7 kDa. A sequential homology search by BLAST4 indicated that DCK from T. thermophilus HB8 shares 27% and 25% sequence identities with the DCK proteins from H. influenzae and E. coli, respectively. In addition, DCK from T. thermophilus

sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1.1 M, and then the solution was applied to a Resource PHE column. The flow-through was pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). This solution was applied to a Resource Q column, and ammonium sulfate was added to the flow-through (final concentration of 1.5 M). The sample was loaded on a Resource PHE column, and the fractions of interest were eluted at 0.6 M ammonium sulfate. The peak fractions were applied to a Resource Q column, and the DCK protein was eluted at 0.1 M NaCl. The protein solution was then subjected to gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex75pg column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 M NaCl. The protein was concentrated to a final concentration of 13.3 mg/mL by Centricon ultrafiltration (Amicon). CoA Kinase Activity The reaction of dCoA to CoA with purified DCK was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The reaction mixture, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM CH3COOMg, 20 mM KCl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.2 mM dCoA (Sigma-Aldrich, Japan) and 10 g/mL purified DCK protein, was incubated at 70°C for 1 h. Samples were analyzed using a HITACHI LaChrom HPLC system. Isocratic separation was performed at 0.75 mL/min on a Mightysil PR-18GP column (Kanto Chemical) with UV detection at 260 nm. The elution was performed using the following conditions: eluent A, 20 mM diethyl ethanol amine, 30 mM phosphate; eluent B, 100% methanol; gradient program: 2% B for 40 min, then 2­20% B over 10 min, and finally 20% B for 15 min. The follow rate was maintained at 0.75 mL/min. The products eluted from the column were monitored at 260 nm.

Crystallization and Data Collection Crystals of the ATP complex were obtained from droplets containing 1 L of the protein and 1 L of the reservoir solution [100 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), 20 mM 2-(Ncyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES, pH 9.5), 0.8 M sodium citrate, 6% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3000, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM ATP] at 20°C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. After a week, hexagonal crystals appeared. The space group is P32, with cell dimensions a b 102.26 Å, c 65.76 Å. For data collection, crystals of the SeMet protein were transferred to a cryogenic solution containing the original mother liquor with 30% PEG200. X-ray diffraction data were collected with a MAR charge-coupled device (CCD) detector installed on beamline BL44B2 at the SPring-8 synchrotron facility (Harima, Japan), using flash-frozen crystals at 100 K. All X-ray diffraction data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package.8 Data collection statistics are presented in Table I. Structure Determination and Refinement The crystal structure of the SeMet-labeled DCK was determined by the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method. Nine of the 12 selenium positions were found using SOLVE,9 and phases were calculated with data ranging from 20 Å to 2.8 Å. Electron density modification was subsequently performed with the program RESOLVE,9 giving an overall figure of merit (FOM) of 0.656. The quality of the calculated electron density map was sufficient to trace the polypeptide chains and to locate the side-chains. The model of the protein molecules was built using the program O.10 The structure was refined using the Crystallography & NMR System (CNS) program package.11 All refinement

steps were monitored with the free R-factor, based on 10% of the X-ray data. Following a simulated annealing protocol, the structure was refined using atom-positional and temperature factor refinement, as well as manual model building. The N- and C-terminal regions (Met1­Ala5 and Gly197­Gly203, respectively) in all 3 protein molecules were not visible in the electron density map, due to disorder. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed by PROCHECK.12 The refinement statistics are listed in Table I. The atomic coordinates of the described crystal structure have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, under the accession code 1UF9. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Enzymatic Activity DCK produces CoA and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) from dCoA and ATP. To confirm the enzymatic activity, ATP and dCoA were incubated at 70°C for 1 h, with or without purified DCK, and then the products in the reaction mixtures were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 1). Two peaks (peaks 1 and 3) in the chromatogram increased for the reaction mixture containing ATP, dCoA, and the protein, in contrast to the mixture without the protein. These two peaks were identical to those of authentic ADP and CoA, respectively. Concurrently, peaks 2 and 4 decreased in the reaction mixture containing ATP, dCoA, and the protein. These two peaks were identical to those of authentic ATP and dCoA, respectively. The production of ADP and CoA shows that the enzyme has DCK activity. Overall Structure The crystal structure of DCK includes three molecules, A, B and C, in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2). These three molecules are located independently. Five residues of the N-terminal region and 7 residues of the C-terminal region

could not be identified in the electron density map, due to disorder. Of these molecules, molecules A and B are in the unliganded form, while molecule C is a liganded (ATP binding) form. Each molecule consists of 3 domains (core, CoA, and LID domains), which are the typical structural components of the nucleotide monophosphate-binding kinases (NMPK).15 The core domain includes a 5-stranded parallel -sheet, aligned in the order of 5- 4- 1- 3- 2, and 4 -helices flanking both sides of the -sheet. The second domain, the CoA domain, is inserted between 2 and 3. The CoA domain, which corresponds to the binding domain of an acceptor substrate for other NMPKs,15 consists of 4 -helices: 2, 3, 4, and 5. The LID domain is positioned opposite to the CoA domain, beyond the large cleft. This domain, which involves 3 -helices ( 7, 8, and 9), is inserted after 4 and is responsible for nucleotide binding.6 In the present DCK structure, only molecule C has a bound ATP. DCK possesses the P-loop, which is a structural motif for nucleotide binding and contains the Walker A motif,5 GXXXXGKS/T. This sequence motif corresponds to residues Gly15 to Ser22 in DCK (Fig. 3). A structure homology search by the DALI server16 generated 17 proteins with strong structural similarity (Z score 7) to DCK. According to the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) classification,17 all of these proteins belong to the same structural superfamily of P-loop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases. The protein with the highest similarity is DCK from H. influenzae [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 1jjv], with a Z score of 20.9 and a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.2 Å for 178 common C atoms. In addition, a comparison of the DCK structures from T. thermophilus HB8 and E. coli shows that these proteins are similar to each other (Z score

20.0, RMSD of 1.6 Å for 161 common C atoms), as well as to DCK from H. influenzae. Although the Z scores from the DALI search indicate that the monomer structures of these proteins share remarkable structural identity, their crystal packing arrangements are quiet different: a monomer in DCK from H. influenzae, a trimer with noncrystallographic 3-fold symmetry in DCK from E. coli, and 3 independent monomers in DCK from T. thermophilus HB8. ATP-Binding Site Although the protein was cocrystallized with ATP, ATP binding was observed only in molecule C, and the occupancy of ATP was refined as 0.7. The ATP molecule is positioned in the cleft between the core domain and the LID domain. The triphosphate group is located on the P-loop (Fig. 4), as in the other nucleotide kinases.18 Hydrogen bonds are formed between the oxygen atoms of the triphosphate group and the nitrogen atoms of the main-chain and/or side-chains of Ser19 and Ser22 in the P-loop motif. The side-chains of Lys21 and Arg145, which are located in the LID domain, form salt bridges among the phosphate groups: Lys21 for the and phosphates, and Arg145 for the 3 phosphates. The adenine-base hydrogen bonds with the main-chain oxygen atom of Thr177 (N6OO) and the side-chain of Asn176 (N6-O 1). The guanidinium group of Arg141,which is conserved in the NMPK family, stacks with the adenine base from one side. In this conformation, a cationinteraction contributes to base localization and recognition.19 The other side of the adenine base is exposed to the solvent. The ribose moiety makes van der Waals interactions ( 4 Å) with the side-chains of Thr23, Arg141, and Arg145. The triphosphate group binding manner of DCK from T. thermophilus HB8 is very similar to that of DCK from H.

influenzae in the ATP-bound form. In addition, Arg141 and Asn176 are conserved not only in the sequence but also in their spatial positions. The adenine base in the structure of DCK from H. influenzae is stacked between 2 amino acid residues (Arg140 and Leu179) and is screened from the solvent. However, this enzyme has an insertion between 5 and 10. Leu179 is included in this insertion loop; thus, there is no corresponding amino acid in DCK from T. thermophilus HB8. Consequently, one side of the adenine base is exposed to the solvent in the structure of DCK from T. thermophilus HB8. Conformational Change Induced by ATP Binding The mobility of the substrate-binding domains is one of the intrinsic properties of DCKs, as members of the NMPK family.6 Figure 5(a) shows the temperature factor distribution of DCK from T. thermophilus HB8. The LID and CoA domains contain high temperature factor regions (in red), which suggest domain mobility, while the core domain shows low temperature factors (in blue). To compare the structural difference between the DCKs, the common C carbons of 5 -strands (Ile9 ­Thr14, Val35­Asp37, Leu108 ­ Glu112, Gly127­Val131, and Trp172­Leu174 in DCK from T. thermophilus HB8) in the core domain were superimposed with LSQKAB in the CCP4 suite.20 In this comparison among the T. thermophilus DCK structures, the LID domain of molecule C (the liganded form) clearly shifts toward the ATP molecule [Fig. 5(b)]. The conformation of the P-loop does not differ in the 3 molecules. The superimposed structures show that the triphosphate group of ATP can bind to the P-loop without any conformational change of the LID domain. However, in molecules A and B, Arg141 and the adenine base are too far apart to permit van der Waals contacts ( 4 Å). Furthermore, the side-chain of Arg145 cannot contact the ribose moiety. Although the hydrogen bonds of the triphosphate group of ATP with the

P-loop play important roles in the recognition of the ATP molecule, the van der Waals and stacking interactions with the Arg residues may also contribute to the tight binding. To evaluate these domain movements, the C carbons of Ser22 and Lys145 were chosen as the standard points to measure a distance, D1, since these residues form salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with the phosphate group of the ATP molecule along the direction of the domain movements. Due to the lack of a corresponding amino acid residue (Arg144) in the crystal structure of DCK from H. influenzae, Ser149 was also chosen as the standard measurement point for the distance to Ser22, D2. Table II lists the distances between the two standard points. Domain movements were evaluated by Dn (Dn of the protein in comparison) (Dn of molecule C from T. thermophilus

HB8), where n 1 or 2. Here, the positive values indicate that the compared DCK structures have a wider cleft between the LID domain and the CoA domain. The D values clearly show the tendency of the domain movements. The D2 value of DCK from H. influenzae is only 0.5 Å, whereas the other D values are around 2 Å. Figure 5(c) shows the superimposition of molecule C (the ATP-bound form) of DCK from T. thermophilus HB8 and the DCKs from H. influenzae and E. coli. The LID domains of the DCKs from T. thermophilus HB8 (cyan) and H. influenzae (yellow) are well superimposed. This result demonstrates the correlation that the smaller D values are of the liganded form and the larger D values are of the unliganded forms. In addition, all of the D values are positive, indicating that molecule C of DCK from T. thermophilus HB8 possesses the narrowest cleft in the

ATP binding site. During the phosphate transfer reaction, the -phosphate of the ATP molecule must be shielded from a nucleophilic attack by the omnipresent water.15 Thus, it is quite reasonable that the DCKs have a deep cleft as the substrate-binding site. The "open" conformation (the unliganded form) is suitable for ATP to enter the cleft. After ATP binding, the "closed" conformation (the liganded form) may be needed to keep the ATP molecule in

the binding site. The slightly narrower cleft of the T. thermophilus DCK molecule C than that of H. influenzae DCK indicates that the DCK from T. thermophilus HB8 grasps the ATP more closely, which may compensate for the lack of a residue corresponding to Leu179 in the DCK from H. influenzae. Although the CoA domains bind no ligand, the CoA domain of molecule C moved closer to the bound ATP

molecule as compared with the CoA domains of molecules A and B. The observed movements of the CoA domain in DCK from T. thermophilus HB8 are as large as about 3 Å between molecules B and C. The CoA domain has a number of positively charged residues. Among these residues, Arg68, Arg69, and Arg73 are oriented toward the ATP molecule, and would be attracted by the negatively charged phosphate groups. Consequently, these electrostatic interactions could lead to the movement of the CoA domain. According to a theoretical modeling study of dCoA binding, the distance between the 3 -OH and the -phosphate of ATP is about 7 Å in the "open" conformation of the CoA domain.2 Therefore, the CoA domain must shift toward the ATP molecule by at least 5 Å. For the "closed" conformation, the CoA domain should move even closer. The observed movement of the CoA domain in the absence of its ligand is still insufficient, but the inherent tendency and direction of the domain movement may favor a larger movement upon ligand binding. To achieve the domain movements, the CoA domain has a clear hinge composed of Lys49 and Pro 91 within the domain. Lys49 is inserted between 2 and 3, while Pro91 is included in 5 and breaks the hydrogen-bond network within the main-chain. In the helix, the Pro residue provides a kink and confers flexibility at this hinge point. In addition, this Pro residue is widely conserved among other NMPKs (Fig. 3); thus, it may play an essential role in the mobility of the CoA domain. Comparison With Other DCKs In comparison with the other DCK structures (from H. influenzae and E. coli), the T. thermophilus DCK structure displays some notable differences. In the CoA domain, the helix linkage between 2 and 3 is formed by only 1 residue for the DCK from T. thermophilus HB8, while those of the DCKs from H. influenzae and E. coli are formed by 4 residues. In addition to this insertion, a second insertion was found between 5 and 10, based on the DCK from T. thermophilus HB8: One amino acid is inserted in the DCK from E. coli, and 5 amino acids are inserted in the DCK from H. influenzae. These insertions are within flexible loop moieties. Generally, the absence of flexible loops contributes to increased thermostability for proteins.21,22 Thus, the shorter loops in these regions of the DCK from T. thermophilus HB8 may enhance the thermostability of the protein.
