Introduction Clostridium perfringens type E has been reported to cause antibiotic-associated enterotoxemia in rabbits and to produce i-toxin. In addition, Clostridium spiroforme which also causes antibiotic-associated enterotoxemia in rabbits produces an i-like toxin (Carman and Borriello, 1982), which shows partial antigenic identity with itoxin (Popoff and Boquet, 1988). Furthermore, anti-i-toxin antiserum was reported to prevent death caused by C. spiroforme infection. It therefore has been reported that i-toxin is a major factor in enterotoxemia (Sakurai, 1995; Sakurai et al., 1997). Stiles and Wilkins (1986a) purified i-toxin as a binary toxin from culture supernatant of C. perfringens type E. Furthermore, they reported that i-toxin consists of an enzyme component (Ia) and a binding component (Ib), neither of which has toxic activity when injected alone (Stiles and Wilkins, 1986b; Aktories and Wegner, 1989; Considine and Simpson, 1991; Sakurai and Kobayashi, 1995). However, these proteins are known to act in binary combinations to produce cytotoxic, lethal and dermonecrotic activities. Recently, we reported that Ib binds to Vero cells, itself oligomerizing to form ion-permeable channels, and then the formation of the oligomer induces endocytosis (Nagahama et al., 2002). Several papers have reported that Ib binds to a receptor on the cells and transfers Ia into the cytosol, where Ia ADP-ribosylates actin (Stiles et al., 2000; Blocker et al., 2001; Richard et al., 2002). Bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins, such as diphtheria toxin (DT) (Collier, 1975), Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA) (Wick et al., 1990), cholera toxin (CT) (Spangler,

1992), Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) (Spangler, 1992), pertussis toxin (Kaslow et al., 1987), Pseudomonas exoenzyme S (ExoS) (Liu et al., 1996), Clostridium botulinum C3 enzyme (C3) (Aktories et al., 1988), C. botulinum C2 toxin (C2 toxin) (Aktories et al., 1986), C. spiroforme toxin (Aktories et al., 1994), and epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN) from Staphylococcus aureus (Sugai et al., 1990), have been studied as agents that contribute to the pathogenesis of bacteria. It is known that CT, LT, C3, the enzymatic component (C2-I) of C2 toxin, ExoS, EDIN and the enzymatic component (VIP2) of Bacillus cereus vegetative insecticidal protein (CT group) contain three conserved regions, aromatic residue-R/H, E-X-E, and hydrophobic residue-S-T-S-hydrophobic residue, but DT and ETA (DT group) do not (Domenighini and Rappuoli, 1996). The analysis of the LT crystal suggested that the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ docks into the cavity (Domenighini and Rappuoli, 1996). The role of these regions is thought to be as follows. The polar side chains of E-X-E extend toward the catalytic cavity and the consensus sequence is involved in forming the NAD+ cleft, an aromatic residueR/H located deep in the cavity binds NAD+, and the S-T-S consensus sequence is folded in a b strand representing the floor of the cavity. Glu-378 and -380 in Ia are included within the E-X-E sequences essential for the enzymatic activities of CT, LT, and ExoS. Arg-295 in the component is present in the aromatic residue-R/H sequence. Ser-338, Ser-340, and Thr-339 in Ia are present in the S-T-S consensus sequence. Ia contains these three motifs, showing that Ia belongs to the ADPribosylating toxin group along with CT, LT, and C3. Perelle et al. (1996) reported that Glu-378, Glu-380, and Arg-295 are involved in the ADP-ribosylation of Ia. Damme et al. (1996) described a pivotal role for Glu-378 in Ia which was photoaffinity labeled with [carbonyl-14C]NAD+. We investigated the reaction mechanism by use of conservative substitutions and kinetic analysis, discovering that Arg-295 plays an important role in the binding of Ia to NAD+, that Ser-338 and Glu-380 play an important role in the cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond of NAD+ (NAD+-glycohydrolase (NADase) activity) and that Glu-378, which is not required for NADase activity, is essential for the transfer of the ADPribose moiety to actin (ADP-ribosyltransferase (ARTase) activity) (Nagahama et al., 2000). Glu-378 within the E-X-E motif (Glu378-X-Glu380) of C2 toxin and Glu-379 within the motif Glu379-X-Glu381 of Exo S have been reported to be essential for ARTase activity but were not required for NADase (Barth et al., 1998; Radke et al., 1999). These findings are consistent. Recently, the structure of VIP2 was solved by Han et al. (1999). In addition, the role of amino acid residues at the catalytic site (NAD+ binding site) was discussed based on the results from the site-directed mutagenesis of Ia and C2-I (Nagahama et al., 2000; Barth et al., 1998). However, little is known about the role of amino acid residues in the cavity except those in the motif of the family. To study the structure­function relation of Ia in more detail, we have determined the crystal structure of Ia with NADH and replaced amino acid residues in the NADH-binding site by site-directed mutagenesis, determined NADase (EC 3.2.2.5) and ARTase (EC 2.4.2.30) activities of variant components, and analyzed the enzymatic properties of these components.

Materials and methods Crystallization ( Ia­NADPH crystals of the space group P212121 (cell dimensions of a ¼ 59:6 A, ( c ¼ 93:5 A, a ¼ b ¼ g ¼90 ) were grown by vapor diffusion at 4 from ( b ¼ 88:4 A, drops containing 10 mg mlÀ1 Ia, 10 mM Tris at pH 7.5 equilibrating against a reservoir containing 18% PEG4000 (w/v), 16 mM NADPH, and 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. To more easily obtain derivatives for multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR), five cysteine residues were introduced into Ia to make S96C/S172C/S218C/S273C/S364C mutant protein. This cysteine mutant crystallized isomorphously with the wild-type P212121 crystals. However, crystals of the Ia­NADH complex, although grown under similar conditions, belonged to a different space group. Thus Ia crystals of ( ( ( space group P1, with cell dimensions of a ¼ 47:7 A, b ¼ 54:1 A, c ¼ 102:2 A, a ¼    99:3 ; b ¼ 93:4 ; and g ¼ 107:1 and containing two molecules per asymmetric unit, were grown by vapor diffusion at 4 from drops containing 10 mg mlÀ1 Ia, 10 mM Tris at pH 7.5 equilibrating against a reservoir containing 18% PEG4000 (w/v), 16 mM NADH, and 10 mM Tris at pH 7.5. Data Collection For soaking and data collection, crystals were transferred to a solution containing 10 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 20% PEG4000 (w/v). Data for the native NADPH complex at ( a resolution of 2.8 A and for heavy atom derivatives using the five-cysteine mutant were collected at room temperature using a MacScience DIP2030, processed with DENZO and scaled using SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). ( Furthermore, high-resolution native data at a resolution of 2.1 A were measured at KEK beamline BL18b; data were processed with MOSFLM (Leslie, 1990). Co( crystal Ia­NADH data at 1.8 A resolution were also measured at BL18b, and data were processed with MOSFLM (Leslie, 1990). MIR Phasing and Model Building Since the search for mercury and platinum derivatives of wild-type protein crystals failed, derivatization of crystals of the five-cysteine mutant was performed. Potentially useful Hg and Pt derivatives were found, and data were measured inhouse. The initial phases were obtained from SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999) and MLPHARE (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994) using three derivatives. Subsequent phase improvement by solvent flattening was particularly powerful. The program package DM (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994) or RESOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999) was used to carry out density modification. The initial free R-factor of 56% dropped to 34% after solvent flattening and histogram matching. The starting model was built into the density-modified electron density map using the program O (Jones et al., 1991) with the help of skeletonized maps.

Refinement Maximum-likelihood refinement, bulk solvent correction and individual temperature factors were used for refinement as implemented in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). Five percent of the measured data were used as test set to calculate the Rfree (Brunger, 1992). Iterative cycles of refinement were carried out against the data at ( 2.8 A resolution, and the resulting model was subjected to further refinement against ( the data at 2.1 A resolution from KEK BL18B. The final model had 410 residues, ( and final refinement converged to an Rfree of 24.8% and Rcryst of 20.5% at 2.1 A resolution. The Ramachandran plot analysis with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) showed that 87.8% of the residues in the current model were in the most favorable regions. The average refined B-factor for the Ia­NADPH model was ( 27.3 A (Eaton and Fernie, 1980). Molecular Replacement for Ia­NADH Co-crystals The P1 co-crystal with NADH contains two molecules per asymmetric unit. An initial molecular replacement solution (RF-function=0.33, one molecule TRfunction monitor=0.36/packing=0.29, dimmer TR-function monitor=0.76/packing 0.57) was found by CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) using as a search model the structure of the Ia­NADPH complex that had been solved by MIR. This model was refined using the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). Final refinement converged to ( an Rfree of 25.0% and Rcryst of 22.4% at 1.8 A resolution. The Ramachandran plot analysis with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) showed that 88.9% of the residues in the current model were in the most favorable regions. The average refined ( B-factor for the Ia­NADPH model was 30.6 A (Eaton and Fernie, 1980). Coordinates of the Ia­NADH and Ia­NADPH structures have been deposited with RCSB under accession codes 1giq and 1gir, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Purification Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the unique restriction site elimination technique using the Transformer mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratory, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) with synthetic appropriate oligonucleotide primers as described previously (Nagahama et al., 1995). All variants obtained were identified by sequencing with the di-deoxy termination kit (Applied biosystems) as reported (Nagahama et al., 1995). The expression and purification of Ia and Ia variants were performed as outlined previously (Nagahama et al., 2000). Enzymatic Assay NADase and ARTase activities were determined and kinetic experiments of NADase activity were performed as described previously (Nagahama et al., 2000).

CD Spectroscopy Secondary structures of the purified proteins were determined using a circular dichroism spectrometer (CD) in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter at 2571 C as reported (Sakurai and Nagahama, 1986).

Results Analysis of the Crystal Structure of Ia with NADH The NADase activity of Ia was specifically inhibited by NADH (50% inhibitory concentration, 40 mM) and NADPH (50% inhibitory concentration, 200 mM). The ( crystal structure of Ia in the complex with NADPH was solved at a resolution of 2.1 A by multiple isomorphous replacement (data not shown). Furthermore, the Ia­NADH ( complex structure was solved at 1.8 A by molecular replacement using the Ia­NADPH complex structure (Tsuge et al., 2003). The result showed that the structure of Ia can be divided into an N-domain (residues 1­210) and a C-domain (residues 211­413) (Fig. 1a). In addition, it was found that the N-domain consists of a b-sandwich core formed by a five-stranded mixed b-sheet (b1; b4; b8; b7; b2) and a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (b3; b6; b5), and the C-domain consists of a b-sandwich core (b9; b12; b16; b15; b10) and a three-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet (b11; b14; b13). Consecutive a-helices (a1; a2; a3; a30 ; a4 in the N-domain; a6; a7; a8; a9-in the Cdomain) and one additional a-helix (a5 in the N-domain and a10 in the C-domain) were arranged around the b-sandwich core. The findings indicate that these domains are structurally similar in spite of limited sequence identity (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1a, the N- and C-domain had a cavity, and NADH or NADPH was folded in the cavity of the C-domain. The RMSD value for the two independent molecules in the ( crystal of the NADH-form, which belongs to the space group P1, was 0.29 A. The RMSD value between the structures belonging to space groups P212121 (NADPH ( complex) and P1 (NADH complex) was 0.73 A. The difference between the two structures seems to be caused mainly by the relative domain positions, not by structural differences within domains. One of the biggest differences within the C-domain was in the structure of the occluding loop region (372­380), which includes the E-X-E motif (Glu-378 and Glu-380). As shown in Fig. 2, in which Ia is superimposed on VIP2, the C-domain structure of Ia is quite similar to that of VIP2, but the N-domain structures differ. The N-domain of Ia has an additional a-helix (a30 : 61266), compared with that of VIP2. The sequence alignment of the C-domains showed that 39.9% of residues were the same between Ia and VIP2, however, this was 19.2% in the N-domain. The crystal structures of Ia and VIP2 are consistent with the sequence alignments. NADH Conformation in Ia Fig. 3a shows the NADH density from an Fo 2Fc omit map calculated without ( NADH at 1.8 A resolution. The nicotinamide ring was clearly identified in the map,

and nicotinamide was not cleaved. The nicotinamide mononucleotide moiety (NMN) in NADH was folded in a ring-like conformation in the cavity of the Cdomain. Amino acid residues in the NADH binding cavity were Tyr-246, Tyr-251, Asn-255, Arg-295, Gln-300, Glu-301, Arg-352, Glu-378, Glu-380, Phe-349, Ser-338, Ser-340 and Thr-339. Residues at the edge of the cavity were Asn-255, Glu-301, Tyr246, and Tyr-251 (Fig. 3b). Moreover, Tyr-251 was exposed outside the cavity and, in addition, seems to be flexible from the X-ray analysis of the Ia crystal.

( 2.94 A, respectively. Oe2 of Glu-380 was near O20 N of the ribose ring in NMN ( (3.05 A). Oe2 of Glu-380 seems to form a hydrogen bond with O20 N in the ( ribose moiety (Fig. 4b). In addition, Og2 of Ser-338 was 4.48 A from O20 N in the ribose ring of NMN (data not shown). Therefore, these observations suggest that a hydrogen bond is able to be formed between these groups. Furthermore, ( the nicotinamide ring of NMN was 4 A above the aromatic ring of Phe-349 (Fig. 3). It is possible that the aromatic ring of the residue restricts rotation of the nicotinamide ring by p2p interaction. These observations indicate that the interaction of NADH with Arg-296, Arg-295, Ser-338, Phe-349 and Glu-380 results in the ring-like conformation of NMN. On the other hand, Tyr-246, Tyr-251, Asn-255 and Glu-301 were in the cavity, but not near NADH folded in the cavity, implying that these residues are not directly involved in the fixation of NAD+ in the cavity.

Analysis of Catalytic Mechanism of ADP-ribosylating Activity of Ia The role of amino acid residues in the cavity on the ADP-ribosylating activity of Ia was investigated. We have reported a relationship between the enzymatic activity and amino acid residues in the sequence conserved among ADP-ribosylating toxins such as CT, LT, C3, C2 toxin, ExoS and EDIN (the E-X-E, S-T-S and aromatic amino acid-R/H motifs) (Nagahama et al., 2000). Therefore, we performed a mutational analysis of additional residues in the cavity; Tyr-246, Tyr-251, Asn-255, Glu-301, Phe-349 and Arg-352 (Tables 1 and 2). The change of Tyr-246 or Asn-255, located at the edge of the NAD binding cavity, to alanine did not result in a marked decrease in NADase. Y246A significantly lost ARTase activity for rabbit muscle actin and human platelet actin. On the other hand, N255A did not significantly lose ARTase activity for human platelet actin, but significantly lost activity for rabbit muscle actin (Table 2). From the kinetic analysis, it was found that the change in the ARTase activity of these variants was dependent on the kcat =Km value, but not on Km : It therefore appears that these residues are important for the recognition of actin or transformation of the ADP-ribose moiety to actin. Replacement of Tyr-251 with alanine caused a significant reduction in NADase activity and ARTase activity for non-muscle actin, and a complete loss of ARTase activity for muscle actin, suggesting that the residue is essential to NADase and ARTase. Replacement of Tyr251 with phenylalanine had little effect on the NADase or ARTase activity, indicating that an aromatic ring at this position is important for these functions. The kinetic analysis revealed that the Km value for NAD+ and actin of Y251A was markedly reduced, implying that the side chain of Tyr-251 is required for binding to NAD+ and recognition of actin. E301A showed no activity. In addition, CD analysis revealed that the CD spectrum of E301A differed from that of wild-type Ia which showed a negative elliptical band at approximately 220 nm (Fig. 5), indicating

that a change of Glu-301 to alanine induces structural alteration. Replacement of Phe-349 with alanine caused a marked reduction in NADase activity, but replacement with tyrosine had no effect, suggesting that the aromatic ring is essential to the activity. Replacement of Arg-352 with alanine caused a drastic reduction in NADase. The Km values for NAD+ of F349A and R352A were significantly higher than that of the wild-type, suggesting that Phe-349 and Arg-352 are important for the binding of Ia to NAD+. The change of Gln-300 to alanine had no effect on NADase or ARTase activity, indicating that the residue is not important for these functions (data not shown).

Discussion In the present study, the structure­function relationship of Ia was analyzed by the crystal structure and by site-directed mutagenesis. The structural analysis revealed that Ia (1­413 residues) can be divided into an N-domain (1­210 residues) and a C-domain (211­413 residues), that has a cavity which binds NADH. It was found that, in the structure, the C-domain of Ia is similar to that of VIP2 and C3 but the N-domain is different from that of VIP2, reported by Han et al. (1999, 2001).

Fig. 5. Far-UV CD analysis of Ia and variant Ia. Data were collected at 195­265 nm and compared with wild-type Ia.

The three conserved sequences in ADP-ribosylating toxins of the CT group, aromatic residue-R/H, E-X-E, and hydrophobic residue-S-T-S-hydrophobic residue, were in the cavity in the C-domain (Domenighini and Rappuoli, 1996; Nagahama et al., 2000). Amino acid residues in these motifs have been reported to be important for ADP-ribosylating activity. We showed that Arg-298 and Ser-338 in the conserved sequences play a role in binding to NAD+ and Glu-378 and -380 in the E-X-E motif are important for the enzymic activity (Nagahama et al., 2000). From the crystal structure, it therefore was confirmed that the NAD+ binding site and the catalytic site of Ia are in the cavity in the C-domain. Residues located near the NAD+ binding site in the C-domain have structural similarity between Ia and VIP2. Tyr-246, Tyr-251, Asn-255, Arg-295, Glu-301, Ser338, Thr-339, Ser-340, Phe-349, Arg-352, Glu-378, and Glu-380 in Ia appear to be structurally conserved, compared with those in VIP2, suggesting that they may be essential for the activity of ADP-ribosyltransferase. One difference in the catalytic Cdomain between Ia and VIP2 is in the occluding loop, which includes the E-X-E motif. While Glu-380 in Ia has the same conformation as that in VIP2, the orientation of Glu-378 located on the flexible loop in Ia is different from that in VIP2. However, glutamic acid residues in the motif have been reported to play an essential role in the catalytic activity of ADP-ribosylation in VIP2 and Ia (Domenighini and Rappuoli, 1996; Nagahama et al., 2000).

We reported that Arg-295 and Ser-338 play a role in the binding of Ia to NAD+ and the ADP-ribosyl moiety (Nagahama et al., 2000). The present study showed that Tyr-251, Phe-349 and Arg-352 also are required for the binding of Ia to NAD+. The crystal structure of Ia suggested that Phe-349 interacts on the nicotinamide ring and Arg-295 and Arg-352 fix two phosphate groups of NADH, and that main chain carbonyl and amide groups of Arg-296 form hydrogen bonds with O7N and N7N in NMN. However, the change of Arg-296 to alanine had no effect, showing that the side chain of the residue is not related to the activity (data not shown). Therefore, the carboxyamide group of NAD+ appears to be fixed by the peptide bonds. Next, kinetic analysis showed that Glu-380 affects the speed of NADase activity rather than the binding to the substrate (Nagahama et al., 2000). Based on the structural analysis, Oe2 of Glu-380 seems to form a hydrogen bond with O20 N in the ribose moiety. It, therefore, is speculated that the ribose moiety is folded by Ser-338 and Glu-380. These observations show that the ring structure of NMN is formed by the specific binding of NAD+ to these residues in the cavity. The common motifs in Ia, belonging to CT group, are different from those of the DT group (Domenighini and Rappuoli, 1996). However, when the structure of the C-domain of Ia is compared with that of DT, the b-sheet of Ia fits that of DT, and the NAD+ binding site of Ia can be superimposed on that of DT (data not shown). This comparison shows the topological similarity between Ia and DT. Furthermore, NMN was reported to be folded at the ring structure in the cavity of DT (Bell and Eisenberg, 1997). It therefore appears that the ring structure of NAD+ is required for ADP-ribosylating activity. The finding that the binding to NAD+ of Tyr-251, which is exposed outside the cavity and is flexible, is required for NADase activity suggests that the residue introduces NAD+ to the cavity. We reported that replacement of Glu-378 with aspartic acid or glutamine caused little reduction in NADase activity, but a marked or complete loss of ARTase activity, indicating that the residue is essential for the latter (Nagahama et al., 2000). Furthermore, the Km values for NAD+ and actin to bind E378D for ARTase did not show drastic change, compared with those for wildtype Ia, but the kcat =Km values for NAD+ and actin to bind the variant Ia were much lower than those to bind the wild-type (Nagahama et al., 2000). Thus, it is apparent that Glu-378 does not play an important role in the binding to actin and the transfer of the ADP-ribosyl moiety to actin. Considering that Glu-378 is flexible, the residue may interact with Arg-177 in actin and promote ADP-ribosylation. Kinetic analysis showed that Tyr-246, located at the edge of the NAD+ binding site, is important for the binding of Ia to actin and a change of Asn-255 results in a significant alteration in substrate specificity (Table 2), suggesting that these residues play a role in the binding to and recognition of actin. Based on these observations, the proposed mechanism of ADP-ribosylation of actin by Ia is as follows. (1) Tyr-251 binds NAD+ in solution, and introduces NAD+ into the binding pocket. (2) Phe-349 restricts the nicotinamide ring rotation, and the carboxyamide group in the nicotinamide ring forms two hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Arg-296. By these specific bindings, the nicotinamide ring seems to be fixed in the cavity. In addition, Arg-295 and Arg-352 electrically interact

with two phosphate groups in NAD+, and Glu-380 forms a hydrogen bond with O20 N in NMN, showing that these residues fix the positions of the ribose moiety and two phosphate groups of NAD+. It therefore appears that the specific binding of NAD+ to Ia results in a ring-like conformation of the NMN moiety of NAD+ at the binding site. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 6a, the ring-like conformation (a) induces access for O1N in the b-phosphate group to a hydrogen atom of the amino ( group in N7N in NMN (distance of 3.26 A), then a hydrogen bond is formed between O1N and N7N and next withdraws the electron from the NH2 group of the carboxyamide group and finally the interaction induces fragmentation to give oxonium ion (b) and nicotinamide, indicating that the N-glycoside bond is cleaved before attack of the guanidium group of Arg-177 of actin. (3) We reported that a change of Glu-380 to alanine or glutamine resulted in a complete loss of ARTase activity (Nagahama et al., 2000). Furthermore, the glutamic acid residue corresponding to Glu-380 of Ia in C3 and VIP2 has been suggested to stabilize the oxocarbenium intermediate (Han et al., 1999, 2001). Based on these reports and the crystal structure of Ia, until the ADP-ribose+ group is transferred to Arg-177 of actin, it appears that the oxonium ion (b) should be stabilized by Oe1 of Glu-380, as shown in Fig. 6b. In addition, the kinetic analysis and the crystal structure imply that Ser-338 binds to O30 N in NMN or interacts on it. Therefore, Glu-380 and/or Ser-338 seems to play an important role in the stabilization of the oxonium cation. The enzymic reaction of ADP-ribosylating toxins such as DT, LT and VIP2 has been described as a direct Sn2 reaction of NAD+ with elongation factor, GTP-binding protein and actin, respectively (Bell and Eisenberg, 1997; Han et al., 1999). They described that it is an Sn2 reaction that is responsible for the cleavage of the

N-glycoside bond of NAD+ and the transfer of the ADP-ribose+ moiety to Arg177 simultaneously with the attack of Arg-177 of actin on the N-glycoside bond between the nicotinamide ring and the ribose moiety in NMN. From our results, it is not completely excluded the Sn2 reaction mechanism from ADP-ribosylating reaction of Ia. However, according to modern organic chemistry, most glycosylation involves the Sn1 mechanism through oxonium cations such as (b) (Trost and Felming, 1991). A direct substitution at such a hindered position seems to impede progress including the Sn2 reaction. From these reports, it is reasonable that the ADP-ribosylating reaction depends on the Sn1 reaction. (4) Tyr-246 and Asn-255 interact in solution, and introduce actin into the binding pocket where Glu-378 recognizes and positions Arg-177 near the oxonium ion (b) in the Ia­actin complex. The ADP-ribose moiety is then transferred to Arg-177 (c) (Fig. 6c).

Summary Clostridium perfringens i-toxin is composed of an enzymatic component (Ia) and a binding component (Ib). Ia ADP-ribosylates non-muscle b=g actin and skeletal muscle ( a-actin. We showed that the crystal structure of the Ia complex with NADH at 1.8 A. Ia (1­413 residues) can be divided into two domains, an N-domain (1­210 residues) and a C-domain (211­413 residues) that has a cavity which binds NADH. Site-directed mutagenesis based on the consensus sequences among ADP-ribosylating toxins and the structure of Ia suggest that the catalytic mechanism of Ia proceeds via an Sn1-type reaction as follows. (1) The aromatic ring of Phe-349 restricts rotation of the nicotinamide ring and the carboxyamide group of the nicotinamide forms hydrogen binds with the main chain amide and carbonyl groups of Arg-296. (2) Glu-380 fixes the position of the ribose moiety in NMN. (3) The positively charged atoms from Arg-295 and Arg-352 electrically interact with a- and b-phosphate groups of NAD+, respectively. (4) The specific binding of NAD+ to Ia induces a change in NAD+, that results in a ring-like conformation. (5) The b-phosphate group of NAD+ makes a ( hydrogen bond with the amino group of nicotinamide (distance of 2.92 A) and then withdraws the electron from the amino group, suggesting that the transfer of this electron induces the spontaneous cleavage of the N-glycoside bond (the Sn1-type reaction) and consequently an oxocarbenium ion is produced. (6) The resulting oxonium cation of the ADP-ribosyl moiety should be stabilized by the negatively charged carboxyl group of Glu-380 and perhaps Ser-338. (7) The Arg-177 recognized by Glu-378 in actin is located near the oxonium cation in the Ia­actin complex, and then the ADP-ribose moiety is transferred to the Arg-177 of actin.
