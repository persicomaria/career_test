Structural Rationale for the Broad Neutralization of HIV-1 by Human Monoclonal Antibody 447-52D
Robyn L. Stanfield,1 Miroslaw K. Gorny,3 Constance Williams,3 Susan Zolla-Pazner,3 and Ian A. Wilson1,2,* 1 Department of Molecular Biology and 2 The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology The Scripps Research Institute 10550 North Torrey Pines Road La Jolla, California 92037 3 New York VA Medical Center and New York University School of Medicine New York, New York 10010 because peptides and protein fragments containing V3 could readily elicit neutralizing antibodies (Goudsmit et al., 1988; Palker et al., 1988; Rusche et al., 1988). The majority of previously described anti-V3 antibodies are type specific and neutralize only T cell line adapted (TCLA) viral strains, although several more recently described antibodies appear to have broader neutralization properties (Gorny et al., 1993, 1997, 2002). 447-52D is a human (IgG3, ) monoclonal antibody produced by a heterohybridoma derived from peripheral blood mononucleocytes from a clade B, HIV-1-infected individual (Gorny et al., 1993). 447-52D recognizes the V3 loop; its core epitope has been mapped with overlapping peptides to the highly conserved V3 crown GPxR (residues 312­315) (Gorny et al., 1992, 1993). Unlike most V3 antibodies, 447-52D can neutralize both X4 and R5 primary viral isolates (Gorny et al., 2002), correlating with its ability to bind V3 peptides with a wide range of sequence variability (Zolla-Pazner et al., 1999). An understanding of how 447-52D is able to effect such unusually broad neutralization for a V3 antibody could facilitate design of an HIV-1 vaccine. Crystal structures have been determined for the core region of gp120 from HIV-1 viral isolates HXB2 and YU2 in complex with CD4 and Fab 17b (Kwong et al., 1998, 2000). As the gp120 cores were extensively modified from wild-type by deletion of 52 N- and 19 C-terminal, 67 V1/V2, and 32 V3 (298­329) residues and by deglycosylation, no structural information could be obtained for V3. However, crystal structures exist for complexes of V3 peptides from the MN viral strain with four different neutralizing antibodies (50.1 [Rini et al., 1993], 59.1[Ghiara et al., 1994, 1997], 58.2 [Stanfield et al., 1999], and 83.1 [Stanfield et al., 2003]) derived from immunization of mice with V3 peptides. The conformation of V3 peptides bound to Fabs 50.1 (CKRIHIGPG), 59.1 (IHIGPGRAFYT), and 83.1 (KRIHIGPGRA) are all highly similar, with residues KRIHI forming an extended strand, immediately followed by a turn around GPGR (type II for 50.1 and 59.1, type I for 83.1). The peptide bound to Fab 59.1 continues with a type-I/I double bend consisting of a type I turn around GRAF and a type I turn around RAFY. The GPGR turn in the Fab 58.2 complex differs from that in the other V3 peptides, largely due to different torsion angles for the first Gly, which cause the peptide backbone to change direction with respect to the structurally conserved KRIHI strand. Residues GPGR in this latter complex form a type I turn, and GRAF a type VIa turn. Many NMR studies of V3 peptides in solution have also been carried out, including two with V3 peptides bound to Fvs. When the V3 peptide from the IIIB isolate (RKSIRIQRGPGRAFVTIG) binds to murine monoclonal antibody 0.5 (Tugarinov et al., 2000), it forms a hairpin with an irregular turn around GPGR, while in the MN V3 complex with human antibody 447-52D (Sharon et al., 2003), the peptide forms a hairpin with a turn around GPGR. Extensive NMR studies of isolated V3 peptides do not indicate any stable structure in solution, although transient turns were found around the GPGR (Catasti et

Summary 447-52D is a human monoclonal antibody isolated from a heterohybridoma derived from an HIV-1-infected individual. This antibody recognizes the hypervariable gp120 V3 loop, and neutralizes both X4 and R5 primary isolates, making it one of the most effective anti-V3 antibodies characterized to date. The crystal structure of the 447-52D Fab in complex with a 16-mer V3 pep° tide at 2.5 A resolution reveals that the peptide hairpin forms a three-stranded mixed sheet with complementarity determining region (CDR) H3, with most of the V3 side chains exposed to solvent. Sequence specificity is conferred through interaction of the type-II turn (residues GPGR) at the apex of the V3 hairpin with the base of CDR H3. This novel mode of peptideantibody recognition enables the antibody to bind to many different V3 sequences where only the GPxR core epitope is absolutely required. Introduction HIV-1 is a membrane-enveloped virus whose outer surface contains oligomeric clusters of noncovalently associated glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 (for review see Turner and Summers, 1999). The gp120 third hypervariable (V3) loop ( 35 residues) varies extensively in sequence among different viral strains, but has a region of relatively conserved residues at the apex or crown (GPGR or GPGQ) of the loop and a conserved disulfide at its base (Cys296­Cys331; HXB2 numbering). V3 has been implicated in many viral functions, including coreceptor binding, such as to CCR5 (Cormier et al., 2001; Rizzuto and Sodroski, 1998, 2000) or CXCR4 (Basmaciogullari et al., 2002) and for determining cell tropism (for review see Hoffman and Doms, 1999). Positively charged residues are frequently found at critical positions in the V3 loop in CXCR4-tropic viruses (DeJong et al., 1992) while neutral or negatively charged residues are found at these positions in CCR5-tropic viruses (Bhattacharya et al., 1996). V3 is also a major inducing epitope for antiHIV-1 antibodies, and was originally termed the "principal neutralizing determinant" (Javaherian et al., 1989)

Figure 1. Stereo view of the 447-52D Fab Complex with the V3 Loop Peptide The C trace of one Fab molecule in the asymmetric unit of the 447-52D/peptide crystal structure is shown with the light and heavy chains in light and dark gray, and the bound V3 peptide in yellow. CDR loops L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, and H3 are colored dark blue, purple, dark green, cyan, pink, and light green, respectively. The peptide in combination with the H3 CDR forms a three-stranded sheet. This and subsequent figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and rendered with RASTER3D (Merritt and Bacon, 1997).

al., 1995, 1996; Chandrasekhar et al., 1991; de Lorimier et al., 1994; Dettin et al., 1993, 1997; Ghiara et al., 1997; Gupta et al., 1993; Huang et al., 1996, 1997; Markert et al., 1996; Sarma et al., 1997; Vranken et al., 1996; Vu et al., 1996, 1999; Zvi et al., 1992). Addition of 20%TFE (Catasti et al., 1995, 1996; Chandrasekhar et al., 1991; Vranken et al., 1996; Zvi et al., 1992) usually stabilizes an -helical conformation immediately C-terminal to GPGR. NMR studies on peptides modified by cyclization (Cabezas et al., 2000; Chandrasekhar et al., 1991; Gupta et al., 1993; Huisman et al., 2000; Tolman et al., 1993; Vranken et al., 1995, 1996, 2001), by replacement of Ala316 with the conformationally restricted residue -aminoisobutyric acid (Cabezas et al., 2000; Ghiara et al., 1997), by glycosylation (Huang et al., 1996, 1997; Markert et al., 1996), through attachment to resin beads (Jelinek et al., 1997a), through attachment to a bacteriophage viral coat protein (Jelinek et al., 1997b), and through attachment to carrier proteins, such as BPTI (Wu et al., 2000) and MUC1 (Fontenot et al., 1995), all show an increased turn propensity around GPGRAF. Significantly, V3 peptides attached to filamentous bacteriophage fd viral coat protein pVIII (Jelinek et al., 1997b) adopt a double-turn structure similar to that observed in the Fab 59.1-peptide crystal structure (Ghiara et al., 1994, 1997). ° We report here the crystal structure at 2.5 A resolution of Fab 447-52D in complex with a clade B V3 peptide that represents the first structural example of an antiV3 antibody with neutralizing activity against a number of X4 and R5 primary isolates. In addition, the Fab contains a CDR L3 of a previously unclassified length (3 amino acid insertion after L95), thus providing a new canonical structure for L3. Results and Discussion Fab Structure The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains two Fab/ peptide complexes related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. Both complexes are very similar, and unless noted otherwise, discussion will focus only on the first molecule. The Fab light and heavy chains will be identified by L and H, the peptide by P. 447-52D is the first human

IgG3 Fab for which an X-ray structure has been determined (Figure 1). Not surprisingly, the IgG3 CH1 is struc° turally very similar to the IgG1 CH1 (rmsd of 1.1 A for all CH1 C atoms of 447-52D and IgG1 HIL [PDB code 8fab]) as only 4 residues differ (H127, H129, H207, and H222).

Figure 2. Comparison of Fab L3 CDR with Other Canonical L3 CDRs (A) New L3 CDR structure. The 447-52D L3 (salmon) is shown superimposed on loops from HC19 and CHA255 (1gig, 1ind; yellow; Chothia class L3-1A), NEW (7fab; purple; class L3-1B), SE155 (1mfa; cyan; class L3-1C), and KOL (2fb4; blue; class L3-2). The class L3-1 loops have no insertions after residue 95, the class L3-2 loops have two insertions after residue 95, and 447-52D has three insertions after residue 95, making it the longest L3 loop seen thus far in an Fab structure. (B) Conformational changes in 447-52D L3 side chains. The 44752D L3 CDR loop (salmon) is shown superimposed on the 11 other L3 loops (yellow) containing Trp at positions L91 and L96 (PDB codes 1a6u, 1dl7, 1etz, 1f4w, 1gig, 1ind, 1mfa, 1ngp, 1sm3, 1yuh, and 2vir). The side chain positions for these Trp residues differ in 447-52D, possibly as a result of peptide binding.

Figure 3. Comparison of H3 Loops with Kinked and Extended Bases (A) This stereo view of the 447-52D H3 shows that its base is "kinked," contrary to the prediction from its sequence. The 447-52D AspH101 points away from the TrpH103 side chain, allowing TrpH103 N 1 to hydrogen bond to the AspH101 backbone carbonyl oxygen. (B) The CDR H3 of Jel103 (PDB code 1mrc) forms an extended base, where the AspH101 side chain hydrogen bonds to the TrpH103 N 1 atom.

The elbow angles for the two 447-52D Fab molecules are 208 and 204 . Two residues fall in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot: AsnL51 is in a highly conserved turn in almost all antibodies and represents the major canonical structure for CDR L2 (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997), and Asp L151 is at the tip of an exposed loop. CDR's L1 and L2 belong to canonical classes L1-1 and L2-2 (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997; Martin and Thornton, 1996). However, L3 (with a 3 residue insertion after residue 95) is longer than previously classified loops. A comparison of L3 with those of classes L3-1 (no insertions after L95) and L3-2 (two insertions after L95) is shown in Figure 2A. Other interesting features of the 447-52D L3 are the unusual side chain dispositions of TrpL91 and TrpL96 (Figure 2B). TrpL91 usually has side chain torsion angles of 1 180 , 2 90 , but in 447-52D 90 . TrpL96 maintains the same these are 1 60 , 2 rotamer, but shifts slightly from its usual position. In the 447­52D complex, ProP313 is sandwiched between TrpL91 and TrpL96, suggesting that these Trp side chains may have rearranged to accommodate peptide binding. The H1 and H2 CDRs belong to canonical classes 1 and 4, as expected from their length and sequence. The long H3 CDR (20 residues in length [DGFIMIRGVSEDYY YYYMDV; H95-H102]) forms a regular hairpin with a type I turn around residues GlyH100b-ValH100c-SerH100d-

° GluH100e and extends out approximately 25 A from the antibody combining site (Figure 1). The residue types found at H93, H94, and H101 (Thr, Thr, Asp) predict an extended structure for the base of the 447-52D H3 (Morea et al., 1998; Shirai et al., 1996) rather than the "kinked" conformation found here (Figure 3). The side chain of AspH101 normally hydrogen bonds to TrpH103N 1, but in 447-52D, AspH101 points away from Trp, and the preceding backbone carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds to TrpH103N 1. The AspH101 position is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between AspH101O 1 and TyrH100kOH. At least three other Fabs also have kinked bases not predicted by their sequence: Fab 26-10 (1igj [Jeffrey et al., 1993]) containing AlaH93, GlyH94, and AspH101; Fab B02C11 (1iqd [Spiegel et al., 2001]) with AlaH93, ValH94, and AspH101; and Fab 83.1 with AlaH93, IleH94, and AspH101 (Stanfield et al., 2003). Peptide Structure The 16-mer peptide used for cocrystallization (CKRIHIG PGRAFYTTC-NH2; 304­309, 312­321; peptide numbering according to HXB2 [Ratner et al., 1987]) corresponds to the MN V3 sequence. Residues P305­P316 (KRIHIGP GRA) can be clearly interpreted in the electron density maps (Figure 4A) except for the LysP305 side chain. Weak electron density corresponding to three additional resi-

Electron Density for the V3 Peptide Bound to 447-52D (A) This stereo view shows the SA 2Fo-Fc electron density (cyan) after refinement, contoured at 1.5 around the V3 peptide (yellow) for the first molecule in the asymmetric unit. Side chain atoms are not included in the model for residue LysP305 due to weak electron density for its side chain. (B) Additional density for three more residues is visible when contoured at 0.7 and would extend the sheet to four strands. Our best interpretation of that density is shown in black, but these residues have not been included in the final model. Electron density is shown for only this area for clarity. Attempts to improve the density, such as NCS averaging, were not successful. This figure was generated with BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1999) and rendered as in Figure 1.

dues at the C terminus (FYT; P317­P319) (Figure 4B) was found, but despite repeated attempts to extend the model (see Experimental Procedures section), these residues could not be positioned with confidence and are not included in the final model. Peptide residues KRIHI form an extended strand, followed by a type II turn around GPGR (Figure 5). The peptide strand surprisingly forms extensive main chain interactions with CDR H3 resulting in a three-stranded mixed sheet, with an up/down/down topology (Figures 5A and 5B) and a standard left-handed twist (Figure 5C). The sheet has one largely polar face consisting of PheH97, MetH99, ArgH100a, AspH100f, TyrH100h, TyrH100j, ArgP306, HisP308, and ArgP315, and, on the other side, a more hydrophobic face coated by the side chains of IleH98, IleH100, TyrH100g, TyrH100i, IleP307, and IleP309 (Figure 5D). Six hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge are made between peptide and Fab 447-52D, all to CDR H3. The salt ° bridge between AspH95 O 2 and ArgP315 NH1 (3.3;3.4 A; molecule 1 and molecule 2) anchors the peptide to the base of H3. The only side chain hydrogen bond is be° tween TyrH100j OH and HisP308 N 1 (3.0;3.1 A) (Figure 6A). The remaining five hydrogen bonds are between the peptide main chain atoms and the Fab CDR H3 main chain ° in the sheet interaction (AspH100fN-LysP305O, 3.4;3.4 A;

° ° AspH100fO-IleP307N, 2.6;2.9 A; TyrH100hN-IleP307O; 2.7;2.8 A; ° ° TyrH100hO-IleP309N, 2.6;2.9 A; TyrH100jN-IleP309O, 3.0;3.1 A). ArgP315 makes cation- interactions with TrpH33 and ° TyrH100j, where Arg N is 3.8 A from the center of the ° TyrH100j ring and 3.6­3.8 A from the center of the aromatic ring of the TrpH33 indole (Figure 6B). The ArgP315 guanadinium moiety is nearly coplanar with the TrpH33 indole (interplanar angle of 11 ;16 ) and TyrH100j ring (7 ;13 ). Hydrophobic interactions are made by IleP307 and IleP309 with Fab residues Tyr H100i and TyrH100g (Figure 6A). The ° ProP313 side chain in the GPGR turn is about 3.6 A from the TrpL91 indole, with the rings nearly coplanar (interplanar ° angle of 7 ;7 ), and about 3.7 A from TrpL96 with the respective rings nearly perpendicular (interplanar angle of 76 ;80 ) (Figure 6B). In the Fab-peptide complex, molecular surface areas ° of 555;585 A2 (molecule 1;molecule 2) are buried on the ° Fab and 478;494 A2 on the peptide. The majority (77%) of the buried Fab surface is contributed by the heavy chain (59% from H3), and is composed mainly of Tyr, Trp, Asp, and Glu side chains (43%, 30%, 9%, and 8% of the surface, respectively). The peptide fits snugly into its binding site, with only one unfilled cavity near IleP309 (Figure 7A). A total of 116;162 van der Waals contacts are made between peptide and Fab, with the majority

Note the internal pseudo-symmetry where H3 residues IleH98, MetH99, IleH100, and ArgH100a "mirror" peptide residues IleP309, HisP308, IleP307, and ArgP306 across the C-terminal strand of H3.

from H3 (55%;43%), L3 (20%;33%), and H1 (21%;20%), and few to no interactions with L1 (2%;4%), H2 (1%;0%), and L2 (0%;0%) (Figure 6A). The differences in the van der Waals contacts in the two complexes are due to a ° slight variation in the position of the peptide ( 0.5 A) relative to each Fab (Figure 7B). Otherwise, the structures are very similar as reflected by corresponding rmsds in C position for VL, VH (H1­H113) and peptide ° (P305­P316) of 0.12, 0.22, and 0.77 A, respectively, when the VL domains (L1­L107) are superimposed. The corresponding superposition on VH domains results in rmsds ° in C for VL, VH, and peptide of 0.23, 0.12, and 0.64 A, respectively. Peptide Binding Motif Previous epitope analysis using overlapping peptides indicated that the core epitope of 447-52D was GPxR (Gorny et al., 1992) which agrees well with the crystal

structure, where the highly conserved turn crown (GPGR) is inserted into the heart of the 447-52D combining site, with its extended region (KRIHI) interacting with antibody through extensive main chain hydrogen bonding to the CDR H3 backbone, resulting in a composite three-stranded sheet. Thus, main chain interactions dominate peptide binding to 447-52D, so that side chain substitutions at many positions in the peptide can easily be accommodated. Specific interactions with ProP313 and ArgP315 at the base of the binding site likely confer specificity for V3-like sequences despite the nonspecific nature of the main chain interactions. This conclusion is also consistent with screening of 447-52D against a 15mer phage-display library (Keller et al., 1993), which showed that of 55 binding peptides, Gly, Pro, and Arg were always selected at P312, P313, and P315, respectively. On the other hand, 447-52D could bind peptides with many different residues at P308, with the most

The side chains of the Fab residues in contact with peptide are shown in a ball-and-stick representation. (B) A magnified view of the cation- and salt bridge interactions between peptide and Fab. The V3 peptide residue ArgP315 forms a salt bridge with AspH95, and makes cation- interactions with the side chains of TyrH100j and TrpH33. Peptide residue ProP313 is nestled into a cleft formed by Fab residues TrpL91 and TrpL96, with the Pro ring nearly coplanar to the TrpL91 indole.

frequent being Leu (15/55), His (9/55), Phe (6/55), Arg (5/55), and Tyr (5/55), indicating that the HisP308 hydrogen bond seen in the crystal structure is not critical for peptide binding to 447-52D. However, position P309 is more restricted to hydrophobic residues, with Phe (17/55), Tyr (12/55), Ile (8/55), Val (7/55), and Leu (7/55) appearing most frequently. At P314, Gly (30/55) and Ala (10/55) are strongly preferred, but Ser, His, Lys, Leu, Asn, Gln, and Arg can also be tolerated in the phage display peptides. A slight preference is found for Gly (11/55) at position 316, although perhaps surprisingly, many other residues are tolerated. GlyP316 (the i 2 residue in the type II turn) has torsion angles of  74 , 5 , in the lefthanded -helical region of the Ramachandran plot. Thus, substitution at P316 with a non-Gly residue might be expected to change the turn type by flipping the P316 carbonyl. The carbonyl makes no hydrogen bonds to the antibody in the present structure, and there is ample room to accommodate this flip should it take

place. Otherwise, no strong preferences are found at positions prior to P308 or after P316. Thus, it appears that only the V3 GPxR crown residues are highly restricted in sequence preference, with little or no specific requirements at other positions. The strong preference for Arg at position P315 is also in agreement with neutralization data, where the nonclade B primary isolates that are neutralized by 447-52D retain an Arg at this position (Conley et al., 1994; our unpublished data). However, most non-B viruses have a Gln at position P315, and it is not yet clear whether the Gln substitution in the V3 crown can be recognized by 447-52D. Conserved V3 Structure 447-52D, 50.1, 59.1, and 83.1 are all independently derived anti-V3 antibodies and differ in their gp120 reactivity and virus neutralization profiles. Nevertheless, the conformations of the overlapping V3 peptide segments in the various antibody-peptide structures are all very

While the GPGR tip of the peptide is bound into a pocket in the antibody-combining site, the other side chains are exposed to solvent or near unfilled pockets in the surface.

similar (Figure 8). The rmsds (C atoms) for the 447-52D V3 peptide when compared to peptides bound to 50.1, ° 59.1, and 83.1 are 1.1 A (for the eight residues in common ° ° with 50.1), 1.2 A (seven in common with 59.1), and 2.6 A (ten in common with 83.1) respectively. Antibody 50.1 (epitope CKRIHIGPG) is extremely specific for MN-like viral strains, whereas 59.1 (epitope IGPGRAFYT) can neutralize both MN and IIIB strains, probably because its epitope starts immediately after the IIIB QR insertion. Antibody 83.1 (epitope KRIHIGPGRA) has been reported to also neutralize some R5 primary isolates (SF162, AD87), as well as those passaged in cell culture one to two times (WH89-330) (White-Scharf et al., 1993). Antibody 58.2 (epitope RIHIGPGRAFY) is fairly broad, neutralizing SF162, AD-87, JR-FL, BaL, WH91-327, WH89-330, WH91330, WH189-164, and FDA-300 (White-Scharf et al., 1993). Interestingly, 58.2 recognizes a second, distinct V3 conformation, which differs mainly in the type of turn around GPGR, as well as in the main chain torsion angle for the first Gly residue of the turn, resulting in a strikingly different disposition of the turn with respect to the N-terminal extended strand. Although it is not straightforward to correlate the V3 conformations bound to the different antibodies with their neutralization profiles, it is striking that the V3 epitopes recognized by 447-52D and 50.1 are very similar in both conformation and extent. Yet, 50.1 is highly type specific for TCLA viruses, while 447-52D can neutralize a number of primary isolates. Thus, the superior breadth of neutralization by 447-52D does not appear to correlate with recognition of a novel V3 conformation, but rather reflects the unique mode of antibody-V3 interaction in which only the highly conserved positions in the crown are required for specificity. In addition, although the backbone conformation of V3 bound to 447-52D overlaps well with V3 peptides bound to 50.1, 59.1, and 83.1, the ArgP315 side chain when bound to 447-52D is oriented in a different direction. The side chains of ArgP306, HisP308, and ArgP315 all cluster on the same face recognized by 447-52D, but ArgP315 is on the opposite side of the peptide in the other complexes. Interestingly, these positions are among those implicated as being important in chemokine receptor binding (Basmaciogullari et al., 2002). Comparison with NMR Structure The conformation of a V3 peptide bound to Fv 447-52D was also recently determined by NMR where unlabeled 447-52D Fv was complexed with 15N- or 13C-labeled 23mer MN peptide (YNKRKRIHIGPGRAFYTTKNIIG), and the V3 peptide conformation derived using TROSY and standard heteronuclear NMR methods (Sharon et al., 2003). The major difference between the peptide confor-

Figure 9. Stereo view of the Superposition of the V3 Peptide Stereo view of the superposition of the V3 peptide (yellow; residues K305­A316) from the 447-52D Fab/peptide complex with that previously determined by NMR (purple; K305­T320, [Sharon et al., 2003]) from a 44752D Fv/peptide complex. Although the peptide conformations are similar overall, the NMR-derived structure shows ordered structure for a region of the peptide that is less well ordered in the crystal structure, although some electron density is present (see Figure 4B).

mation found in the NMR and X-ray studies is the extent of the structured region (KRIHIGPGRAFYTT) found in the solution study. The four C-terminal residues (FYTT; P317­P320) in the NMR structure are largely disordered in the X-ray structure, although weak and broken electron density (Figure 4B) corresponds approximately to the path taken by the main chain in the NMR structure and would extend the mixed sheet to four strands. Our provisional interpretation of this disordered region in the crystal is consistent with the reported NOEs within this region for ArgP306HN/ThrP319HN, ArgP306HN/ThrP320H , IleP307H /TyrP318H , and HisP308HN/TyrP318H (equivalent dis° tances in the X-ray model of 2.6, 4.6, 2.9, and 3.8 A). P317 side chain cannot be positioned However, the Phe in a similar manner in both X-ray and NMR structures. Otherwise, the peptides are similar in their overall fold ° (Figure 9), with an rmsd of 1.3 A for the ten C atoms (KRIHIGPGRA) used in the superposition. Although the NMR structure has a turn around the GPGR region, compared to a type II turn in the X-ray structure, these backbone differences are actually rather small. The main chain torsion angles for ProP31372 , GlyP314 in the NMR and X-ray structures are  65 ;  87 , 25 (NMR), and  65 , 130 ;  75 , 5 (X-ray), and deviate only by slight variations in the positions of the GlyP312 and ProP313 carbonyl oxygens (Figure 9). Within the GPGR turn, NOEs are reported between ProP312H and ArgP315HN with a strong sequential interaction between GlyP314HN and ProP313H (Sharon et al., 2003) that are in good agreement ° with the corresponding distances of 3.3 and 2.2 A in the type II turn of GPGR in the X-ray structure. VH and VL Genes Analysis of the 447-52D gene sequence (http://imgt. cines.fr; http://www.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk/vbase-ok.php? menu 901) shows that the light chain is a product of IGLV1-51*01 and IGLJ3*02 genes, and the heavy chain

of IGHV3-15*07, IGHJ6*03, and IGHD3-10*01 genes. VL1 genes make up 5 of the 31 functional VL genes, while VH3 genes make up 22 of the 51 functional VH genes. The 447-52D CDR H3, which makes the majority of interactions with V3, is derived from the D3-10 segment used in reading frame 3 (D3 5/25 functional segments) and the JH6 gene segment (JH6 1 out of 6 functional JH segments). 447-52D has a long CDR H3 of 20 residues in length (12 residues inserted after H100). H3 loops vary in length from 2 to 30 residues in human antibodies (1­19 in mouse) (Collis et al., 2003), but human anti-viral antibodies frequently have very long CDR H3s, with an average length of 16.5 residues for 95 analyzed. The CDR H3 regions of other HIV-1-neutralizing Fabs, such as b12 (18 residues in length), 2F5 (22), X5 (22), and 17b (19), also have long CDR H3s that may allow some of these antibodies access to recessed regions on the viral gp120 (Saphire et al., 2001). Whether the long H3 would confer such an advantage to 447-52D is conjectural at this point, as the degree of V3 exposure is unclear, although some studies suggest that V3 is accessible to many anti-V3 antibodies (Nyambi et al., 2000; York et al., 2001). HIV-1 Vaccine In conclusion, we have uncovered the structural basis for why 447-52D recognizes its V3 epitope in HIV-1 gp120 with unusually broad specificity for a V3 antibody. A major question is whether an immunogen can now be designed to elicit this type of antibody response. The germline genes of 447-52D are not unusual, and while it has been reported that the VH3 family of antibodies decreases in patients during the late stages of HIV-1 infection (David et al., 1996; Scamurra et al., 2000), this should not be a problem in immunizing uninfected individuals. Immunization with a peptide or peptido-mimetic constrained to mimic the V3 conformation recognized by 447-52D might elicit 447-52D-like antibodies, but would

and broad neutralization and to help in the design of immunogens to induce antibodies with broad and potent neutralizing activity.
Experimental Procedures Fab Production and Purification IgG 447-52D (IgG3, ) was prepared as previously reported (Gorny et al., 1993). Briefly, peripheral blood cells pooled from two HIV1-infected individuals were transformed and then fused to a human/ mouse hetero-myeloma cell line (SHM-D33). The resulting heterohybridoma expressing Mab 447-52D was selected for its ability to bind a 23-mer peptide corresponding to the V3 sequence of the MN isolate (YNKRKRIHIGPGRAFYTTKNIIG) and repeatedly cloned until monoclonality was achieved. Fab fragments were prepared by cleavage of 447-52D IgG with 4% papain in 10 mM L-cysteine for 4 hr, followed by sequential purification of the Fab over Protein A, Superdex 200 (10/30 column, 0.2 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5), and monoS columns (10/10 column: buffer A 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5; buffer B 50 mM sodium acetate, 1 M sodium chloride, pH 4.5). Human IgG3 Fc regions normally bind poorly to protein A; however, protein A can bind the Fab regions of members of the human VH3 family (of which 447-52D is a member) through conserved framework residues (Graille et al., 2000). Crystallization and Data Collection The peptide used for cocrystallization has been previously termed MP1 (CKRIHIGPGRAFYTTC-NH2; 304­309, 312­322; peptide numbering according to the HXB2 reference [Ratner et al., 1987]). The Fab/peptide complex was prepared by mixing Fab (20 mg/ml) and peptide (10 mg/ml) in a 1:5 molar ratio. Crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion with a 1 ml well solution of 1.23 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, and a sample drop consisting of 0.5 l protein, 0.5 l well solution. The crystals grow as clusters of thin plates that can be separated prior to mounting for data collection. Crystals were cryo protected by brief immersion in well solution containing 25% glycerol. Diffraction data were collected at Beamline 11-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory with an ADSC Q315 CCD detector, at a wavelength of ° 0.984 A. The crystal was indexed in monoclinic space group P21 ° ° ° with unit cell dimensions a 76.5 A, b 75.4 A, c 100.0 A, 100.3 , with two Fab/peptide complexes in the asymmetric unit, and a refined mosaicity of 0.65 . The Matthews' coefficient (Matthews, ° 1985) was 2.8 A3/Da corresponding to 56% solvent. Data were ° processed to 2.5 A resolution (Table 1) with the HKL package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). In the deposited coordinates, the Fab light and heavy chain residues from molecules 1 and 2 are labeled L, H, M, and I; the peptide residues are labeled P and Q; and the Fab is numbered by the Kabat convention. Structure Determination and Refinement The structure was determined by molecular replacement using Fab HIL (PDB code 8fab; molecule 2), separated into its variable and constant domains as search models. HIL is a human (IgG1, ) with sequence identity to 447-52D of 58% and 66% in the Fab variable light and heavy chains, respectively. Using the cross-rotation and translation routines from AMoRe (Navaza, 1994), the two variable domain dimers and two constant domain dimers in the asymmetric unit could be oriented and positioned in the unit cell with a correlation coefficient (CC) and Rcryst of 29.3% and 49.7%, respectively. The two Fab molecules are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold rotation axis in the xz plane, 60 from z, as expected from the presence of a corresponding peak in the MERLOT (Fitzgerald, 1988) self-rotation function. Rigid body refinement of the four domains ° with AMoRe, using all data from 15 to 4 A, resulted in a CC and an Rcryst of 40.8% and 48.3%, respectively. The Rcryst dropped to 44.5% after rigid body refinement of eight domains (VL, VH, CL, and CH1 from each Fab) in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) using all data from 15 ¨ ° to 4 A. After one round of simulated annealing refinement, the Rcryst ° and Rfree values were 34.2% and 38.2% at 2.5 A resolution. The model was then "mutated" to reflect the proper 447-52D sequence, and several cycles of model building and positional refinement with

certainly result in a diverse population of V3 antibodies. To elicit 447-52D-like antibodies, the immunogen must induce an immune response that duplicates the main chain hydrogen bonding observed in this structure, avoiding interactions with the majority of the side chains that would lead to a type-specific response. This may require an immunization regimen that favors the maturation of the antibody response with prolonged intervals between several doses. The identification of several other anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies with broad neutralizing activity (Gorny et al., 2002) suggests that this type of immune response can be obtained. Thus, these structural data can now be taken together with results of structural studies of the other rare broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies b12 (Saphire et al., 2001) and 2G12 (Calarese et al., 2003) to ascertain principles for efficient

CNS were carried out. Clear electron density for the bound peptide was apparent after the first round of simulated annealing (Figure 4). Rebuilding was carried out with several different types of electron density maps including A-weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps, and 2Fo-Fc maps modified by solvent flipping and NCS averaging. Throughout refinement, the VL, VH peptide, CL, and CH1 atoms were restrained as four individual groups with NCS restraint weights of 200. Final refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. As expected due to the NCS constraints, the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are very similar (root mean square deviation [rmsd]) for all C ° atoms is 0.57 A). Hydrogen bonds were evaluated with HBPLUS (McDonald and Thornton, 1994) and CONTACSYM (Sheriff et al., 1987), and the electrostatic surface was evaluated with GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). Coordinates for V3 peptides in Figure 8 are from their structures with Fabs 50.1 ( Rini et al., 1993), 83.1 (Stanfield et al., 2003), 59.1 (Ghiara et al., 1997; 1994), 58.2 (Stanfield et al., 1999), 447-52D (Sharon et al., 2003), and a chimeric rhinovirus (Ding et al., 2002).
