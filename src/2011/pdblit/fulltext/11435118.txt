Crystal Structure of Thiamin Pyrophosphokinase
David E. Timm*, Jingyuan Liu, L.-J. Baker and Robert A. Harris
Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA Thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) is a coenzyme derived from vitamin B1 (thiamin). TPP synthesis in eukaryotes requires thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK), which catalyzes the transfer of a pyrophosphate group from ATP to thiamin. TPP is essential for central metabolic processes, including the formation of acetyl CoA from glucose and the Krebs cycle. De®ciencies in human thiamin metabolism result in beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy. The crystal structure of mouse TPK was deterÊ mined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction at 2.4 A resolution, and the structure of TPK complexed with thiamin has been re®ned at Ê 1.9 A resolution. The TPK polypeptide folds as an a/b-domain and a b-sandwich domain, which share a central ten-stranded mixed b-sheet. TPK subunits associate as a dimer, and thiamin is bound in the dimer interface. Despite lacking apparent sequence homology with other proteins, the a/b-domain resembles the Rossman fold and is similar to other kinase structures, including another pyrophosphokinase and a thiamin biosynthetic enzyme. Comparison of mouse and yeast TPK structures reveals differences that could be exploited in developing species-speci®c inhibitors of potential use as antimicrobial agents.

Introduction
Humans lack the ability to synthesize thiamin and, therefore, require dietary sources of this compound, also known as vitamin B1. Thiamin is converted to thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) by thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK). TPP is essential for normal carbohydrate utilization as a coenzyme for central metabolic functions,1 ± 3 including the Krebs cycle as part of the a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The importance of thiamin in human and animal diets has been appreciated for a long time. Thiamin de®ciency in humans causes beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy. Beriberi has been known for centuries as a potentially fatal disease of the Far East resulting in neurologic and cardiovascular problems. Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological condition often encountered in

chronic alcoholism due to reduced intake and uptake of dietary thiamin.4 Inhibition of TPK by ethanol may also contribute to this condition.5,6 The formation of TPP is necessary for centrally important metabolic processes,1 ± 3 and the loss of TPK activity is lethal in yeast.7,8 In addition to functioning as a carrier of activated acyl groups in a-keto acid dehydrogenases required for glucose metabolism, TPP is required for carbohydrate metabolism by transketolase, pyruvate decarboxylase and pyruvate oxidase. TPP is also a coenzyme for the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes and acetolactate synthase required for branched chain amino acid degradation and synthesis,2 respectively. TPP formation is also important in signaling and driving cellular transport of thiamin.2,8 TPP levels regulate mitochondrial a-keto acid dehydrogenases,9 and feedback inhibition of TPK by TPP10-12 may be a mechanism for maintaining proper TPP levels as a regulatory feature of these central metabolic enzymes. TPP also regulates transcriptional levels of thiamin biosynthetic enzymes in yeast and effects mating in ®ssion yeast.2,8 Finally, TPP is the precursor of thiamin triphosphate, which may have non-cofactor effects on neurologic cells.13

196 TPK has been characterized using material isolated from natural10 ± 12,14 and recombinant sources.7,8,15 TPK amino acid sequences are poorly conserved between species, and database searches have revealed no sequence similarities to other kinases or other families of proteins. TPK from different species has subunit masses ranging from 23-36 kDa associated as dimers in solution.10,14 TPK utilizes ATP and thiamin as substrates in a pyrophosphate transfer reaction that requires Mg2 and proceeds by an ordered sequential mechanism.10 ± 12 Crystallographic studies of TPK were initiated to provide an improved understanding of

from crystals soaked with thiamin were used for subsequent re®nement of the enzyme/substrate Ê complex at 1.9 A (Figure 1(b)). The asymmetric unit of the TPK crystals contains two subunits. Electron density for the main chain is continuous for authentic residues in both subunits. However, disorder is indicated for the N-terminal His tags with nine residues missing from the electron density for one subunit and 19 missing from the other subunit. The TPK structure The TPK subunit structure can be described as an N-terminal a/b-domain and a C-terminal b-sandwich domain assembled about a central tenstranded b-sheet (Figure 2). The ®rst half of the central b-sheet is arranged as parallel b-strands sandwiched between a-helices to form a threelayered a/b/a sandwich. The second half is formed from a jelly-roll of antiparallel strands which gives rise to the second sheet of the twolayered b-sandwich. The overall dimensions of the Ê Ê subunits are about 56 A in length and 31 A in width. The TPK subunits associate as a dimer shaped like a diamond (Figure 2(c)) or a U (Figure 2(d)) when viewed parallel with or perpendicular to the non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, respectively. Residues have been numbered relative to the authentic start Met residue and end in A or B to distinguish between the two subunits. The dimeric association is mediated primarily by interactions between the b-sandwich domain of one subunit with both the a/b and b-sandwich domains of the opposite subunit. These contacts primarily involve the loops between residues Pro207 and Pro211 and between Gly230 and Thr233 that protrude in towards the dimer interface from the opposing b-sandwich

domains. Limited direct contact is also made between the a/b-domains in the vicinity of residues Leu128 to Leu139 and their 2-fold related counterparts. Consistent with previous studies indicating a dimeric association in solution,10,14 the solvent-accessible surface area buried between the Ê subunits is 2808 A2. Surprisingly, 11 residues of the His tag from one subunit extend away from the TPK dimer to make a seemingly unlikely lattice contact that forms a short two-stranded b-sheet centered about a 2-fold crystallographic axis. Thiamin-binding site The location of the TPK active site has been identi®ed using data collected from crystals soaked with thiamin (Table 1; Figure 1(b)). The thiaminbinding site is located in the dimer interface distal to the non-crystallographic 2-fold axis in a cleft between the a/b-domain of one subunit and the b-sandwich of the opposite subunit (Figure 2(c) and (d)). This binding site is formed by a b-bulge between Ser216B and Asn219B, and loops between Gly199B and Asn203B, and between Asp95A and Asp100A (Figure 3). The pyrimidine ring and methylene C atom stack parallel with the Trp202B indole ring (Figure 1(b)). The pyrimidine methyl group is in van der Waals contact with the sidechains of Leu204B and Leu214B in the hydrophobic core of the b-sandwich. Hydrogen bond potential exists for the side-chains of Ser216B and Asn219B and the pyrimidine ring N1H atom, while the Asp97A side-chain appears to accept a hydrogen bond from the amino group and participate in a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the N2H atom (Figure 3). The positive charge on the thiazole ring N3 atom may interact with partial negative charges on the main-chain O atoms of Thr21B and Gln96A located to either side. The thiazole methyl

group and C5 atom are also in van der Waals contact with the CH2 atom of Trp202B and the Cb atom of Ser218B, respectively. The thiamin hydroxyethyl group points in the direction of the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis into a solvent-accessible space that occurs in the a/b-domain between the parallel b-strands and the a-helices beginning at Gly47A, Thr99A, and Arg131A. Crystal structures of several TPP-dependent enzymes have been reported.17 ± 20 These include transketolase, pyruvate decarboxylase, pyruvate oxidase, benzoylformate decarboxylase and branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase. Crystal structures have also been reported for thiamin phosphate synthase21 and hydroxyethylthiazole kinase,22 which are involved in microbial thiamin biosynthesis. Some general features are shared in common between TPK and certain TPP-dependent enzymes. The pyrimidine ring tends to bind in a hydrophobic environment for most of these enzymes. Also, the intersubunit binding site and aromatic stacking of the pyrimidine ring in TPK are similar to interactions observed in transketolase and the a-ketoacid dehydrogenase. However, these features are not universal among all TPP-dependent enzymes, and many differences can be identi®ed. The TPP-dependent enzymes impose an energetically unfavorable ``V'' conformation between the pyrimidine and thiazole rings that positions the amino group to activate the C2 carbanion.23 Thiamin phosphate synthase also imposes a V conformation, but places the thiazole methyl group in a cis position relative to the amino group. In contrast, TPK has no apparent functional gain from unfavorable steric arrangements of the two ring systems and represents the ®rst example of thiamin binding to an enzyme in the low-energy

``F'' conformation. Thus, the highly conserved intercalation of a hydrophobic side-chain between the pyrimidine and thiazole rings in TPP-dependent enzymes and thiamin phosphate synthase is absent from TPK. Interactions of polar groups with both the pyrimidine and thiazole groups observed in the TPK/thiamin structure also vary signi®cantly compared to other thiamin-binding enzymes. In particular, the conserved hydrogen bonding of a Glu side-chain with the pyrimidine N1H atom believed to stabilize an imino tautomer of N4H in TPP-dependent enzymes23 is absent from the TPK structure. Comparison to yeast TPK Mouse TPK has been compared to the structure of TPK from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to evaluate the conservation of structural features between enzymes sharing a 26 % sequence identity over 288 residues. Details of the yeast TPK structure, conÊ taining thiamin and re®ned at 1.8 A to an R-factor of 0.216 (Rfree  0.234), will be reported elsewhere. The yeast TPK amino acid sequence is 75 residues longer than mouse TPK. This difference in size is due to 20 additional N-terminal and seven additional C-terminal residues, a 38-residue insertion and several smaller insertions of three residues or less. Overall, the TPK dimers from these species superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation Ê (rmsd) of 1.6 A for 406 Ca atoms in 19 secondary structures (Figure 4(a)). The N-terminal extension in yeast TPK wraps around the b-sandwich domain to add an additional antiparallel b-strand in close proximity to the thiamin binding site. The 38 residue insertion occurs at the end of an a-helix to replace a short loop between Lys115 and Val121 in mouse TPK with a structure containing two a-

helices. This insertion packs against the a/bdomain near the helix between Thr99 and Lys115 and the edge of the parallel b-sheet in close proximity to the loop contacting the thiazole ring between Asp95 and Asp100. Many of the residues in the active site and contacts between thiamin and TPK are conserved, including the pyrimidine ring stacking against a Trp side-chain, the hydrogen bonding of a Ser side-chain to the N1H atom, and the positioning of the thiazole N3 atom between main-chain oxygen atoms (Figure 3). However, the environment surrounding the pyrimidine methyl group in mouse TPK is formed by a Cys, a Trp and a Val residue in yeast TPK, and the Asp interacting with the N3H and N4H atoms in mouse TPK is replaced by Tyr. Other similar structures While structures similar to both TPK domains are common in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), it is worth noting that these motifs are also present in other proteins of related function. Structures resembling the TPK a/b-domain are present in another pyrophosphokinase and several small molecule kinases. Repeats of a ®ve-stranded parallel b-

sheet ¯anked by helices on either side are found in the structure of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase.24 This enzyme also catalyzes a pyrophosphate transfer reaction and superimposes Ê on mouse TPK with an rmsd of 2.0 A over 58 Ca atoms present in ®ve secondary structures (Figure 4(b)). Comparable levels of structural similarity are also found for other small molecule kinases, including adenosine kinase, ribokinase and hydroxyethylthiazole kinase (ThiK).22 Interestingly, ThiK is required for microbial biosynthesis of thiamin via a salvage pathway, and the active sites of TPK and ThiK occur in the same general vicinity following superposition. However, the substrate binding sites do not superimpose between the two structures. The hydroxyethyl thiaÊ zole ring in ThiK is located about 9 A away from the thiamin thiazole ring in TPK, and the superimposed ATP bound to ThiK clashes with the TPK loop between Asp95 and Asp100. Besides PRPP, the only other known pyrophosphokinase structure of hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK)25 shows only super®cial similarity to TPK, with a three-layered a/b/a structure containing a central antiparallel rather than a parallel bsheet. Finally, elements of the TPK a/b-domain

also resemble the ubiquitous Rossmann fold present in many nucleotide-binding proteins.26 Numerous structural homologs of the TPK b-sandwich domain are also represented in the PDB. The TPK jelly-roll motif is most similar to a number of viral structural proteins and concanavalins. Similarities between TPK and an epimerase, RmlC,27 from Gram-negative bacteria may be of greater functional signi®cance. The superposition of RmlC and TPK gives an rmsd Ê of 1.7 A for 39 Ca atoms in six secondary structures. The pyrimidine ring of the nucleotide substrate of RmlC binds to the exposed edge of a b-sandwich, stacking against a Tyr

side-chain in a manner similar to the pyrimidine binding to TPK. However, the comparison is again general in nature, and the RmlC binding site actually occurs on the opposite side of the b-sandwich relative to the superimposed TPK structure. Conclusions The TPK structure provides a molecular framework for understanding the general mechanism and regulation of an essential enzyme and pyrophosphate transfer reactions. This type of biochemical reaction is essential for many aspects of

202 living systems. In addition to thiamin metabolism, pyrophosphate transfer reactions are also essential for the biosynthesis of amino acids, folates, purine and pyrimidine bases, and the nucleotides and coenzymes derived from these compounds. Recent reports of pyrophosphokinase structures provide an opportunity to further the understanding of this group of enzymes, which lags signi®cantly behind traditional kinases that transfer orthophosphate. While additional studies of TPK are required to determine details of ATP and Mg2 binding, regulation by TPP and inhibition by ethanol, the TPK/ thiamin structure provides some insight into aspects of TPK function. A likely ATP-binding site is formed in the vicinity of thiamin and the Arg131 side-chain. The high degree of solvent accessibility of this site is consistent with the relatively high Km value reported for ATP in kinetic studies of TPK.10 ± 12 An interaction of the b and/or g phosphate groups with the guanidinium group would place the b-phosphorus atom in a position suitable for in-line nucleophilic attack by the thiamin hydroxyl oxygen atom. The structure and sequence surrounding Arg131 is consistent with this scenario. A sulfate ion is bound to the Arg131 sideÊ chain located within 2.5 A of the thiamin hydroxyl (Figure 3). A nearby cluster of Asp residues (46, 71, 73 and 100) is likely to function along with phosphate groups and potentially the thiamin hydroxyl group in the coordination of the Mg2 cofactor required for catalytic activity. Asp side-chains also coordinate Mg2 in many TPP-dependent enzymes. Arg131 is at the N terminus of an a-helix preceded by a loop containing a Gly-rich sequence (126-GGLGGR-131) reminiscent of the Rossmann fold26 GXGXXG motif that functions with the helix dipole to bind nucleotide phosphate groups. A Gly-rich motif (14-GAGKGT-19) also interacts with nucleotide bound to adenosine kinase.28 However, Ê barring a large conformational change, the 13.5 A distance between thiamin and the nearest Gly residue in this loop makes it unlikely for the Gly residues to directly contact phosphate groups in TPK. This situation is similar to that of aldehyde dehydrogenase,29 which revealed novel placement and use of the Rossmann fold in nucleotide binding. It should also be noted that the Gly-rich motif, Arg131 and the Asp cluster are strictly conserved between TPKs from different species. However, the lack of sequence similarities and conservation of speci®c ligand interactions between TPK and other thiamin and nucleotide binding proteins suggests that rather than having an evolutionary relationship, common structural motifs have simply been adapted in different ways to a common use. Finally, the results of these crystallographic studies suggest that TPK should be considered as a target for the design of antimicrobial agents. TPK is essential for basic carbohydrate utilization; S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe growth and other is dependent on TPK,2,7,8 24,25 are being targeted for pyrophosphokinases similar purposes. Mouse TPK residues Asp97,

TPK Crystal Structure

Asp207 and Leu214 are substituted in yeast by Tyr, Trp and Arg, respectively. These non-conservative substitutions could be exploited in developing species-speci®c thiamin analogs. Furthermore, the additional N-terminal b-strand present in yeast TPK places a sulfhydryl group in van der Waals contact with thiamin. While additional full-length TPK sequences will need to be determined to fully assess TPK as a target, the mouse enzyme shares 91 % identity over 137 residues of a partial human sequence, but only 38 % identity with the next closest sequence available. Therefore, it seems likely that the level of variability between mouse and yeast TPK will be similar to the levels between humans and pathogens.

Materials and Methods
Expression and crystallization Mouse TPK15 has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a polyhistidine fusion protein using the vector pET28a. The fusion protein contains a 20 residue His tag for a total of 263 residues. TPK was puri®ed using nickel-charged metal chelate chromatography (Pharmacia) and elution with imidazole, and is stored frozen at À80  C in 150 mM NaCl. Crystals were grown at room temperature in the space group P3121 having Ê Ê Ê unit cell dimensions of 90.1 A Â 90.1 A Â 140.4 A using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method where equal volumes of an 11 mg/ml TPK solution were mixed with precipitant solutions containing 1.8-2.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Hepes and 2-4 % PEG400, pH 7.1. Structure determination and crystal soaking The TPK crystal structure has been determined using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method.16 Selenomethionine-substituted TPK was produced by over-expressing the recombinant enzyme in a de®ned medium containing selenomethionine and using the methionine auxotrophic strain, DL41(DE3). MAD data (Table 1) were collected at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron beam line 19ID. The data were integrated using HKL2000 and merged and scaled using SCALEPACK.30 The partial structure of seven selenium atoms was determined using the program SOLVE.31 The Se parameters were further re®ned and crystallographic Ê phases were calculated to 2.4 A using MLPHARE.32 Further improvements of the experimental electron density map were achieved by density modi®cation and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging implemented in DM.32 Data from TPK crystals soaked in precipitant solution containing 10 mM thiamin for 16 hours were collected using a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode X-ray generator and an R-axis IIc detector. These data were integrated using HKL v1.96.0 and merged and scaled using SCALEPACK.30 Model building and refinement The initial SeMet-substituted TPK model containing 494 amino acid residues was built using the program O.33 This model was re®ned with cycles of water building using REFMAC32 and ARPP32 with non-crystallographic symmetry restraints and a bulk solvent

TPK Crystal Structure correction to yield a model having 66 water molecules and an R-factor of 0.26 (Rfree  0.29). Manual rebuilding of the model, placement of additional water molecules and re®nement using CNS34 v0.9 with non-crystallographic symmetry restraints and a bulk solvent correcÊ tion yielded an R-factor of 0.225 (Rfree  0.250) at 2.4 A (Table 1). This model was used in three additional cycles Ê of model building and re®nement against 1.9 A data collected from the thiamin-soaked crystal.
