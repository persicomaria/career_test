The role of the SH1 subsite in trypsin, chymotrypsin and plasmin has been examined by measuring the association with seven different mutants of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI); the mutants contain Gly, Ala, Ser, Val, Leu, Arg, and Trp at the PH1 position of the reactive site. The effects of substitutions at the PH1 position on the association constants are very large, comprising seven orders of magnitude for trypsin and plasmin, and over ®ve orders for chymotrypsin. All mutants showed a decrease of the association constant to the three proteinases in the same order: Ala > Gly > Ser > Arg > Val > Leu > Trp. Calorimetric and circular dichroism methods showed that none of the P1H substitutions, except the P1H -Val mutant, lead to destabilisation of the binding loop conformation. The X-ray structure of the complex formed between bovine b-trypsin and PH1-Leu BPTI showed that the PH1-Leu sterically con¯icts with the sidechain of P3H -Ile, which thereby is forced to rotate approximately 90  . Ile18 (P3H ) in its new orientation, in turn interacts with the Tyr39 side-chain of trypsin. Introduction of a large side-chain at the P1H position apparently leads to a cascade of small alterations of the trypsin-BPTI interface that seem to destabilise the complex by it adopting a less optimized packing and by tilting the BPTI molecule up to 15  compared to the native trypsin-BPTI complex.

Chothia, 1990; Jones & Thornton, 1996; Otlewski et al., 1999). In the complex, about 10 to 17 amino acid residues on the inhibitor site and 17 to 29 residues of the proteinase make numerous van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions. The principal contact area on the inhibitor side is formed through a sequential epitope called the proteinase binding loop spanning from position P3 to P3H (notation by Schechter & Berger, 1967). The loop is convex and exhibits an extended conformation, which signi®cantly protrudes from the protein scaffold and serves as a simple recognition motif. The central section of the loop contains the solvent exposed P1-P1H peptide bond, called the reactive site, which can be cleaved by a serine proteinase. The fully exposed side-chain of position P1 is of particular importance for the proteinaseinhibitor association energy and, indeed, typical trypsin inhibitors have Arg/Lys at P1, whereas chymotrypsin inhibitors have Leu or Met. In many inhibitor families the amino acid at the P1 position is recognized by a high degree of variability, e.g.

Effect of P10 Mutants of BPTI on Association with Proteinases

11 different amino acid residues were found at P1 in 125 reported sequences of ovomucoid third domains (Laskowski et al., 1990). This variability leads to different spectra of proteinases inhibited by the respective inhibitors. The PH1 position, which is partially buried in different free inhibitor structures (typically by about 50 %), shows a much lower level of sequence variability in different inhibitor families (Apostoluk & Otlewski, 1998). In addition, much less information is available about the role of the SH1 site in the serine proteinases, since commonly used chromogenic or ¯uorogenic substrates possess only a limited number of leaving groups. Therefore, in order to study the speci®city of the SHn subsites, either special peptide substrates based on the principle of intramolecular ¯uorescence quenching (Gron et al., 1992) or measurements of acyltransfer reactions to oligopeptide nucleophiles (Schellenberger et al., 1993) have been applied. Studies with protein inhibitors offer another general possibility to study energetic effects on the prime side of the scissile bond. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) is a well-known model of a canonical inhibitor. X-ray and NMR structures have been determined for free BPTI (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975; Wlodawer et al., 1984; Berndt et al., 1992; Czapinska et al., 2000) and in its complexes with different serine proteinases: trypsin (Huber et al., 1974), chymotrypsin (Scheidig et al., 1997), kallikrein (Chen and Bode, 1983), thrombin (van de Locht et al., 1997) and factor VIIa (Zhang et al., 1999). The P1-P1H peptide bond of the BPTI reactive loop is formed between Lys15 and Ala16. In a recent study, we used 18 different P1 mutants of BPTI to probe the energy of interactions between the P1 side-chain and the S1 pocket of four serine proteinases (Krowarsch et al., 1999). We found a very large dynamic range of the association constants, spanning nine orders of magnitude in the case of bovine trypsin. These huge energetic effects could be rationalized by the determination of X-ray structures of complexes between ten P1 mutants and trypsin (Helland et al., 1999). In order to elucidate the role of the SH1 site and the reasons for the low

level of variability of the PH1 position in canonical protein inhibitors we prepared a set of seven PH1 variants of BPTI and studied their binding to three serine proteinases that are known to strongly interact with BPTI: bovine b-trypsin, bovine a-chymotrypsin and human plasmin.

Results
Association constant values The Ka values for the interaction of seven P1H mutants of BPTI with trypsin, chymotrypsin and plasmin are shown in Table 1. All mutants used in this study contained two additional mutations: Lys15 3 Arg at the P1 site and Met52 3 Leu. Arg is found at the P1 position of many other BPTI-like inhibitors, as e.g. in the inhibitor domain of the Alzheimer's b-amyloid precursor protein (APPI) and the second domain of tissue factor proteinase inhibitor (TFPI). The Lys15 3 Arg mutation is unlikely to affect the observed effects at the PH1 site, since Lys and Arg side-chains bind to trypsin's S1 pocket with very similar energy and stereochemistry (Bode et al., 1984). It has also been shown that the Met52 3 Leu mutation, introduced to enable CNBr cleavage of intact BPTI from a fusion protein, had no effect on the BPTI stability (Yu et al., 1995) and the interaction with several serine proteinases (Krowarsch et al., 1999). Here, the mutants H will be identi®ed only by their P1 mutation. A set H of P1 mutations was chosen to include different properties of the side-chain, such as polarity (Ser, Arg), size (Gly, Leu, Trp) and branching (Val, Leu). Figure 1 shows typical inhibition curves for the complexes formed between plasmin and three PH1 variants of BPTI: Ala16, Gly16, and Arg16. Compared to the Ala16 BPTI, a signi®cant lowering of the association constant can be noticed for the PH1 Gly and Arg variants. It can be noticed that introduction of any of the six residues instead of the wild-type Ala16 leads to a drop in the association constant. The descending order is identical for each of the three enzymes: Ala > Gly > Ser > Arg > Val > Leu > Trp. The effect of the P1H substitution is more pronounced in the case of trypsin and

plasmin: about 107-fold for the Ala16 3 Trp substitution, and lower for the same substitution for chymotrypsin (2.5 Â 105-fold). The relationship between the P1H speci®city of the three enzymes was calculated using their ÁÁGa values: ÁÁGa  (ÀÁGa,Ala16) À (ÀÁGa,Xaa16) and analyzed through the Pearson product-moment correlation. Generally, all correlations are very high. The plot for the trypsin/chymotrypsin comparison is shown in Figure 2. The calculated correlation coef®cient (r) is 0.98 and the s value (slope) is 0.79. For the trypsin/plasmin comparison the r and s values are 0.92 and 0.91, respectively, and for chymotrypsin/ plasmin: 0.84 and 1.03, respectively. This suggests that the SH1 speci®city of the three enzymes is similar and the introduction of different side-chains at H the P1 site results in equivalent energetic effects. Thermodynamic stability of the PH1 variants The very large drop in association energy of the PH1 variants with the serine proteinases might result either from direct effects on the enzyme-inhibitor interface or from indirect in¯uence on the global stability of the inhibitor, and/or on dynamics of the proteinase binding loop. DSC is a sensitive method of detecting the possible in¯uence of mutations on protein energetics. We applied thermal denaturation using a highly sensitive calorimeter to estimate stability parameters for the set of PH1 variants. Typical DSC runs for three P1` variants are shown in Figure 3, and Table 2 presents thermodynamic data collected from calorimetric denaturations of all mutants. As ÁHcal and ÁHvH are similar, a two-state model of denaturation is assumed. It is clear from the obtained results that the substitutions at the PH1 site, with a single exception for PH1 Val, do not in¯uence the

conformational stability of BPTI. The PH1-Val BPTI denatures at Tden about 15  C below the lowest Tden determined for the other six mutants. The respective values of ÁHcal, ÁHvH, ÁScal and ÁGden(298 K) for P1H Val are also much lower than for the other variants studied. If the PH1 Val is excluded, the values of Tden show a variation of 3.5  C and 7.3  C at pH 2.0 and 3.0, respectively. The values of ÁHcal are very similar. ÁCp,den is assumed to be identical for all mutants based on the ÁHcal versus Tden plot (Figure 4). However, ÁCp,den for P1H -Val BPTI was estimated from an independent plot. The calculated values of ÁGden at pH 3.0 and 298 K are shown in Table 2. Due to the similarity of other thermodynamic parameters, the free energy change of denaturation for the six mutants are very similar. The PH1 Val BPTI is about 4 kcal/mol less stable. CD spectra The native conformation of the seven PH1 variants was also analyzed at neutral pH conditions and at room temperature by recording their CD spectra in the range 200-340 nm (Figure 5). It can be noticed that both near UV and far UV regions of the spectra, which inform tertiary interactions and secondary structure, respectively, are very similar. This con®rms that all variants are correctly folded. It is interesting that structural differences could not be detected even for the P1H Val variant, despite its much lower level of stability.

The ÁCp, den value for the Val variant was 0.41(Æ0.04) kcal/mole K.

The crystal structure of the bovine b trypsin-PH1 LeuBPTI The main-chain atoms of the three bovine trypsin-BPTI PH1-Leu complexes in the asymmetric unit superimpose with r.m.s. differences in the Ê 0.21-0.48 A range, while the corresponding differences to the complex with native BPTI are about Ê 1.0 A. The relatively high r.m.s.d from the native BPTI complex arise, to a high degree, because the BPTI molecule is tilted several degrees in the PH1-Leu complex. In addition, three loop regions of trypsin (residues 23 to 25, 70 to 80, 115 to 117) have a slightly different fold compared to the native complex. These differences seem to arise from the lack of a structurally bound calcium ion that is located in the loop formed by residues 70 to 80 in the native structure. Instead, similar to that found for the crystal structure of cationic salmon trypsin (Schrùder et al., 1998), the guanido group of Arg66 replaces the calcium ion by forming strong interactions with the acidic side-chains of the calcium-binding loop. In Figure 6, the trypsin part of the native trypsin-BPTI complex is superimposed onto the trypsin part of molecule A of the P1H -Leu complex. The three NCS-related molecules in the asymmetric unit of BT-BPTI P1H -Leu have all a slightly different tilt of the BPTI molecule, but the differences among them are much smaller compared to the deviation from the native complex.

Analysis of the f and c dihedral angles of the BPTI molecules shows that the conformation of most of the binding loop is preserved, and that the different tilt angles of BPTI relative to trypsin is predominantly due to different f and c dihedral angles of the PH2 and PH3 residues (residue 17 and 18). A survey of the hydrogen bonds of secondary binding contacts also shows that the inhibitor binding loop is only marginally affected by the tilt of BPTI in the PH1-Leu mutant complex. The mutation from Ala to Leu in the PH1 position, nevertheless, seems to create a less favourable interface between trypsin and BPTI, as well as being the primary cause of the inhibitor tilt. As seen from Figure 7, the side-chain of Leu16 (P1H ) is bent towards the P3H residue (Ile18), and is partly occupying the same space as the Ile18 side-chain in the native BPTI complexes. The side-chain of Ile18 (PH3) in the Ala16Leu mutant is, as a result of this, ¯ipped approximately 90  , with the isoleucine side-chain facing towards the trypsin molecule. By so doing, Ile18 is adopting rather unfavourable dihedral angles (w1  À 157  and w2  71  ), with w1 about 30  away from a low energy gauche or trans conformation. Ile18, in its new orientation, is in turn interacting with the Tyr39 side-chain of trypsin, which is tilted approx. 10  compared to the native structure. In order to preserve a favourable binding between Tyr39 OZ and the P4H peptide nitrogen atom, the PH4 residue (Ile19) is slightly moved along with Tyr39. The cascade of small alterations resulting from the Ala16Leu mutation, therefore, seems to give rise to less optimized packing of the protein-protein interface on the P1H site. The reor-

The unfolding experiments were performed on a Nano 5200 calorimeter at a scan rate of 1.0 K/minute and a protein concentration of 100-200 mg/ml (total cell volume 323 ml). Protein scans were performed in 10 mM glycine/HCl at pH 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0. Free energy change of denaturation of PH1 variants of BPTI were calculated at 25  C at pH 3.0 using the Gibbs-Helmholz equation (2).

ientations of the P1H , P3H , and P4H side-chains forces the BPTI molecule to tilt approximately 10-15  compared to the native trypsin-BPTI complex (Figure 6).

Discussion
It is generally believed that the principal speci®city of protein inhibitors and oligopeptide substrates is dictated by the character of the side-chain of the P1 position. Systematic substitutions at this position with large sets of amino acid residues of inhibitors belonging to different families showed up to 109 dynamic range effects on the association constants with different enzymes (Eisenberg et al., 1990; Kojima et al., 1991; Lu et al., 1997; Qasim et al., 1997; Krowarsch et al., 1999). The energetic effects of substitutions at the P1 site are generally independent of the inhibitor scaffold, as found in several different proteinases and inhibitors, e.g. P1 mutations lead to relatively very similar effects on the association energy when introduced in different inhibitor structures (Qasim et al., 1997; Krowarsch et al., 1999). Similar conclusions can be drawn from the comparison of kinetic data using oligopeptide substrates. Statistical analysis performed on chymotrypsin substrate data shows that the range of kcat/Km values for coded P1 amino acid residues is about ®ve orders of magnitude (Schellenberger et al., 1991). A correlation plot of the substrate transition state energy, log(kcat/Km), versus enzyme-inhibitor association energy, log(Ka), determined for a set of P1 oligopeptide substrates and protein inhibitors is a straight line, with a

slope close to unity. This suggests that the interactions within the S1 pocket do not change as the reaction proceeds from the enzyme-inhibitor Michaelis complex to the transition state, as found for subtilisin (Kojima et al., 1991), chymotrypsin (Lu et al., 1997) and cathepsin G (Polanowska et al., 1998). For the discussion of the results presented here it is essential that these correlations show that energetics of the P1 side-chain interaction with the S1 pockets of different serine proteinases is independent of the structural context of the surrounding sequence and the global structure of protein inhibitors/oligopeptide substrates. Our study shows that amino acid substitutions at the PH1 position of the reactive site of BPTI lead to an effect on the protein-protein association energy almost as large as those reported for P1 variants of different inhibitors. About 43 % of the P1H position (Ala16) in the wild-type BPTI is buried and it is shielded from the solvent by the main-chain of Gly36. The dynamic range reported here for the association of the seven PH1 mutants of BPTI with the three proteinases covers seven orders of magnitude. It is unfortunate that there is much less data for PH1 variants than for P1 variants of inhibitors representing other families. We did not observe any correlation of our data with the values of free energy change for the interaction of PH1 variants of turkey ovomucoid third domain with chymotrypsin as determined in the laboratory of Professor M. Laskowski, Jr (personal communication). This inhibitor scaffold showed only one order of magnitude dynamic range in the association constants for the seven variants.

Each spectrum is an average of seven scans. (a) Spectra recorded in the 200-260 nm range (protein concentration  3 Â 10À4M, 1 mm cuvette). (b) Spectra recorded in the 240-340 nm range (protein concentration  3 Â 10À5 M, 10 mm cuvette).

Our Ka values were also compared with data available for the hydrolysis of chymotrypsin substrates analyzed using a global statistical method (Schellenberger et al., 1991). The kinetic kcat/Km values showed only about a tenfold difference for various PH1 side-chains and they do not correlate with our data. A similar lack of correlations for trypsin and chymotrypsin was found with data obtained from acyl-transfer experiments to nucleophile peptides of the structure Xaa-Ala-Ala-AlaAla-NH2 (Schellenberger et al., 1993). Again, the two data sets for trypsin and chymotrypsin showed only about an order of magnitude of effect for the seven amino acid residues. Natural inhibitors belonging to different families conserve very different amino acid residue(s) at PH1,

yet they bind strongly to proteinases, including trypsin or chymotrypsin. As shown by Apostoluk & Otlewski (1998) the PH1 site is dominated by one or two particular side-chain(s) in different inhibitor families. PH1 Ile is fully conserved in 41 unique sequences of squash inhibitors and almost fully (36 of 37 sequences) in the STI family; in the potato 1 family Asp occurs in 54 of 70 sequences; in Kazal inhibitors Glu/Asp are found in 108 of 154 sequences; in the potato 2 family Asn is in 17 of 22 reported sequences; in Bowman-Birk inhibitors Ser occurs in 121 of 126; in ela®n inhibitors Met/Leu is fully conserved; in the ecotin family Met occurs exclusively in ®ve reported sequences. Interestingly, while Ile is fully conserved in two families and Met/Leu in another family, the Ile6 A Leu substitution at PH1 in squash inhibitors induces disorder in the whole loop segment and a more than 103-fold decrease in the association constant with trypsin (Nielsen et al., 1994). Similarly, mutation of Asp46 (P1H ) to Ser in eglin c, a member of the potato 1 family, increases the loop dynamics and diminishes its inhibitory properties (Heinz et al., 1992). While 16 different residues occupy the PH1 position in BPTI-like domains, there is a strong tendency for Ala (151 of 288 total sequences) to occur at this site (Figure 8). This position is much more often occupied by small side-chains like Ala, Gly, Asp, Ser (235 of 288) than by large side-chains such as Ile, Pro, Val, Tyr, Leu, Phe, Lys. In general, BPTI-type inhibitors show a great tendency for Ala to occur at the PH1 site and is seldom replaced with Gly, for example, as in TFPI and bikunin domains. High-level variability of the PH1 position is observed in non-inhibitory proteins such as snake toxins, ion channel blockers, non-canonical inhibitors from tick (TAP and ornithodorin) and many other proteins of unknown function. We suppose that the lack of Ala/Gly at this position is one of the key structural features preventing protease inhibition. In agreement with this, Kohfeld et al. (1996) observed that a single mutation of PH1 Asp16 A Ala increases the binding of the non-inhibitory BPTIlike protein domain C5 of collagen VI to trypsin. The strong preference for Ala at the position PH1 of BPTI-like domains was also shown by the phagedisplay technique. When position 16 of the APPI inhibitor was fully-randomized after selection on immobilized TF-FVIIa (Dennis & Lazarus, 1994) or plasma kallikrein (Dennis et al., 1995), invariant preference for Ala at P1H was found. CD spectra and thermal denaturation measurements show that all variants behave similarly, i.e. their conformation and global stability are similar to the wild-type protein and are not affected by the PH1 mutations. The exception is the valine mutant which is signi®cantly less stable than the others, although its conformation is normal, as judged from CD spectra. The dynamics and conformation of this variant is currently investigated in our laboratory using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Similar conformation and stability of the PH1 variants

suggest that the reason for the huge decrease in association constants with the three enzymes is a property of the proteinase-inhibitor complex and not the inhibitor structure alone.

The crystal structure of PH1-Leu shows that large side-chains in this position of BPTI con¯icts the side-chain of the PH3 position, as suggested by Schellenberger et al. (1994). The side-chain of Ile18,

The P1, PH1, PH3 and P4H residues of the inhibitor are illustrated as ball and stick models. The Figures are generated using BOBSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991; Esnouf, 1997).

the PH3 position in BPTI is forced to rotate approximately 90  , resulting in an energetically unfavourable side-chain dihedral angle (w1  À 157  ). The rotated PH3-Ile side-chain further interacts with Tyr39 of trypsin, forcing BPTI to tilt approximately 10-15  . The speci®c interactions between trypsin and BPTI do not seem to be signi®cantly affected by the small movements when Leu is introduced at the PH1 position, but the backbone dihedral angles of the PH residues are signi®cantly changed. The main-chain dihedral angles are preserved for most of the binding loop, but the f of PH2 and both f and c of PH3 is shifted up to 30  compared to the complex with the native BPTI (PH1-Ala). The resulting tilt of the BPTI molecule relative to trypsin of up to 15  (Figure 6) imposes strain on BPTI and is likely to destabilize the complex. Superpositioning of a series of structures of serine proteinases in complex with BPTI (chymotrypsin (Scheidig et al., 1997)), trypsin in complex with ten different P1 variants of BPTI (Helland et al., 1999) shows that the inhibitor is tilted slightly differently among the complexes, but the differences are only in the order of 1-2  for all complexes. This is far less than the differences among the three NCS related molecules of the PH1Leu complex. The larger tilt angle of the latter complexes arise from the PH1 mutation, while the weaker association probably makes the tilt angle more susceptible for variations due to e.g. different packing environments. As shown from this crystal structure of BPTI PH1-Leu in complex with trypsin, large amino acid residues at the PH1-position of BPTI is unfavourable due to steric con¯icts, mainly with the PH3 residue. Proteinase inhibitors from squash seeds, with a

P3-P3H binding loop which is similar to that of BPTI (Apostoluk & Otlewski, 1998), have a conserved Ile at the PH1 position. In this case, however, there are no con¯icts with the PH3 residue, which is a conserved methionine residue in all known squash seed proteinase inhibitors. Computer modelling of various combinations of PH1 and PH3 residues indicates that branched PH1 residues can be combined with unbranched PH3 residues without serious steric

con¯icts in both BPTI and squash seed inhibitors. In BPTI, a vicinal loop (residue 36 to 39) force the PH1 side-chain in the direction towards the PH3. Branched side-chains at both sites will therefore create strain on the binding loop as well as the P3H side-chain as seen in the present crystal structure. This is in particular evident for b-branched residues at P3H . In addition, b-branched side-chains at the P1H position of BPTI interferes directly with the neighbouring 36-39 loop, which probably explains the dramatic drop in thermal stability of BPTI when valine is introduced at the P1H position (Table 2). In OMTKY3, which does not have a corresponding loop close to the P3-P3H binding loop, the P1H side-chain is allowed to be directed slightly differently, where it is not interacting with the P3H residue to the same degree. In addition, P3H is unbranched in OMTKY3, which allows more space to be occupied by bulky PH1 side-chains. This agrees well with the data on association between serine proteinases and PH1 mutants of OMTKY3, where the dynamic range is relatively small (Laskowski, personal communication). The association constants for the chymotrypsin-BPTI complexes (Table 1) show that chymotrypsin is less affected by mutations in PH1 of BPTI than is the case for trypsin and plasmin. The enzyme-inhibitor interface in trypsin and chymotrypsin complexes is highly similar, but the trypsin complexes form a SH4-PH4 hydrogen bond that is not present for the corresponding chymotrypsin complexes. This hydrogen bond, between Tyr39 OZ in trypsin and Ile19 N in BPTI, is present both in complexes with native and with the PH1-Leu variant of BPTI, but since the PH1 mutation signi®cantly alters the conformation of the PH4 main-chain and the Tyr39 side-chain of trypsin, it is likely that this hydrogen bond also is affected. Since the chymotrypsin-BPTI complex does not include this speci®c interaction (residue 39 is Phe in chymotrypsin), the association is less affected by changes in the PH main-chain conformations. Plasmin shows a similar dynamic range for PH1 mutations as trypsin (Table 1), but the result is more dif®cult to interpret, since no crystal structure of a plasmin-BPTI complex has been determined. However, inspection of superimposed structures shows that plasmin have more loop regions that are likely to form interactions with PH residues of BPTI than is the case for trypsin and chymotrypsin. A possible tilt of BPTI due to mutation to larger amino acid side-chains at PH1, may therefore produce large effects on the total association similar to that of trypsin.

The basic components of culture media were supplied by Merck (Germany). DNA modifying enzymes (T4 polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Boehringher (Germany). DNA sequencing kit was from Amersham (UK) and DNA puri®cation kit from QIAGEN (USA). Oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized by Ransom Hill Biosciences (USA). IPTG and Suc-Phe-pNA, Suc-Gly-Gly-Phe-pNA, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA were from Bachem (Switzerland). Chromogenic substrates: Bz-Arg-pNA, Bz-ValGly-Arg-pNA, Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA and Tos-Gly-ProArg-pNA were purchased from Sigma (USA) and D-ProPhe-Arg-pNA (S-2302) was supplied by Chromogenix (Sweden). 4-nitrophenyl 4H -guanidinobenzoate (NPGB) was from Merck (Germany). Bovine b-trypsin and a-chymotrypsin were supplied by Worthington Biochemical (USA) and human a-plasmin by Kordia (the Netherlands). Expression and purification of the mutants All P1H mutants of BPTI were overexpressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS, using the T7 system (Studier et al., 1990), as described by Staley & Kim, (1994) and Bolewska et al. (1995). The plasmids pAED4 bearing a portion of the E. coli trp operon, which serves as a leader sequence, followed by a Met residue and the BPTI encoding sequences, were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis technique (Kunkel et al., 1987). Details of the puri®cation protocol are published elsewhere (Krokoszynska et al., 1998; Krowarsch et al., 1999). The average yield of the expression was about 3 mg of pure protein per litre of culture. Electrospray mass spectrometry of all genetic variants used in this study was performed with a Finnigan MAT TSQ-700 equipped with an ESI source (USA). Species were assigned according to their molecular masses. Samples were dissolved in a methanol:water mixture (1:1) containing 1 % (w/w) of acetic acid. Molecular masses of all variants were within 1.0 atomic mass unit from the expected values. Standarization of enzymes, inhibitors and substrates Bovine b-trypsin, a-chymotrypsin and human plasmin were dissolved in 1 mM HCl, 20 mM CaCl2. All the solutions of the inhibitors were prepared in 1 mM HCl and chromogenic substrates in dimethyl sulphoxide. The stock solutions of bovine b-trypsin and chymotrypsin were standarized directly by the active site titration with 4-nitrophenyl-4H -guanidinobenzoate as described by Chase & Show (1970). The human plasmin concentration was determined by titration with trypsin-standarized wild-type BPTI. The following substrates were used to measure the residual enzyme activity: b-trypsin: BzArg-pNA, Bz-Val-Gly-Arg-pNA, Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA and Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA; a-chymotrypsin: Suc-PhepNA, Suc-Gly-Gly-Phe-pNA, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA; a-plasmin: D-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (S-2302). The inhibitors stock solutions concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, assuming the molar absorbance coef®cient of 5270 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 280 nm for the BPTI mutants (Kosen et al, 1981). For Ala16 A Trp BPTI a molar absorbance value of Trp (5500 MÀ1 cmÀ1) was extra added (Pace et al., 1995).

Ka values were determined by a modi®ed method of Green & Work, as described by Empie & Laskowski (1982) and Otlewski & Zbyryt (1984). All measurements were performed in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM CaCl2, 0.05 % Triton X-100 (pH 8.3). Plasmin buffer contained additionally 150 mM NaCl. To determine the association constants, increasing amounts of the inhibitor was added to the constant concentration of the protease. The enzyme concentration was chosen to ful®l the condition: 2 < [Eo] Â Ka < 50. For the determination of low Ka values (103-107 MÀ1) the inhibitors were used at much higher concentrations than the enzyme in order to force the formation of the complex. After a suitable incubation time, the residual enzyme activity was measured for about 200 seconds by monitoring the linear release of 4-nitroaniline with a diode array spectrophotometer HP 8452A. The recorded signal was an average value of absorbance in the 380410 nm range corrected for an average absorbance in the 480-510 nm range. The values of Ka were calculated by a three-parameter algorithm [E]  f (E0, Ka, F), using a non-linear regression analysis program GraFit, according to the equation: 1 À1 E  Â E0  À F Â I0  À Ka 2 q À1  E0   F Â I0   Ka 2 À 4 Â E0  Â F Â I0

where: [E0] and [I0] are the total enzyme and inhibitor concentrations, respectively, [E] is the residual enzyme concentration and F is the enzyme-inhibitor equimolarity factor. In the case of weak associations (Ka < 107 MÀ1), only the two-parameter algorithm [E]  f(E0, Ka) was applied. Thermal stability measurements Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed using a Nano II calorimeter (CSC Corp.). The experiments were carried out with protein concentrations of 100-200 mg/ml (total cell volume 323 ml) at a scan rate of 1.0 K/minute under excess pressure of 2.5 atm. Before the DSC run the protein was extensively dialyzed to 10 mM glycine/HCl (pH 2.0), 2.5 or 3.0. Repeated measurements with the same protein sample demonstrated about 70 % reproducibility of the ÁHden values at pH 2.0. The partial speci®c volume of BPTI was estimated to be 0.71 cm3 gÀ1 (Makhatadze et al., 1993). Tden, ÁHcal, ÁHvH and ÁCp,den values were calculated from thermogram analysis using the software CpCcalc provided by CSC Corp. Free energy change of unfolding, ÁGden at 298 K, was calculated from the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation: ÁGden T ÁHcal Tden Tden À TaTden  À ÁCpYden Tden À T  TÁCpYden lnTden À T 2 CD spectra CD spectra of the PH1 mutants of BPTI were recorded on a Jasco model J-715 spectrometer in the range 200-340 nm. The protein was dissolved in 10 mM phosphate-Na, pH 7.0 and passed through 0.22 mm Millipore ®lter. Measurements were made with

a protein concentration of 3 Â 10À5 M using a 10 mm cuvette (240-340 nm range) or at 3 Â 10À4 M protein in a 1 mm cuvette (200-260 nm range).

Crystal structure analysis The complex between bovine b-trypsin and Lys15 3 Arg, Ala16 3 Leu, Met52 3 Leu BPTI was crystallized with conditions previously reported for other trypsin-BPTI complexes (Helland et al., 1999), but this complex yielded a new crystal form. The crystals belong to space group I4122 with three molecules in the Ê asymmetric unit. A complete data set to 1.85 A resolution was collected on one crystal at beamline ID14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, using cryogenic conditions (120 K). The structure was solved by molecular replacement techniques using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994), and re®ned using È the CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and SHELX (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997) software packages. The search model for molecular replacement was the bovine trypsin-BPTI (P1 Lys) complex (Helland et al., 1999). The rotation function was calculated using diffracÊ tion data in the resolution range 15.0-4.0 A with a sphere Ê radius of 25 A. Several possible rotational solutions were found, but translational searches yielded three noncrystallographically (NCS) related solutions. Rigid-body re®nement improved the solutions and yielded a correlation coef®cient of 41.2 % and an R-factor of 44.4 %. All symmetry related molecules were generated for all three solutions, and three molecules that gave a small asymmetric volume were used in further re®nement. The three NCS related molecules were treated independently throughout the re®nement. A total of 12

Effect of P10 Mutants of BPTI on Association with Proteinases sulphate ions and 613 water molecules were interpreted in the ®nal map, and the structures were re®ned without any sF/F or resolution cut-off. The ®nal R-factor and Rfree is 21.1 and 23.3 %, respectively, and the electron density is, in general, well de®ned for both the trypsin and inhibitor parts of the complexes. Three loop regions (residues 23 to 25, 115 to 117, 145 to 148) of trypsin is less well de®ned in all three NCS related molecules due to weak electron density. The stereochemistry is good, but one residue (out of 843) in one of the poorly de®ned loops (residue 115) in one of the trypsin molecules is in a disallowed f/c-region as determined from PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). For further details of the re®nement statistics, see Table 3. Sequence alignment Amino acid sequences of different inhibitor families were aligned using BLAST-P software (Altschul et al., 1997). Accession number The coordinates of the crystal structure reported in this paper has been submitted to the RCSB Protein Data Bank with the accession number 1EMJ.
