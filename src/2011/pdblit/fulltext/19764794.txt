Abstract: The discovery and optimization of a novel series of aminoisoquinolines as potent, selective, and efficacious inhibitors of the mutant B-Raf pathway is presented. The N-linked pyridylpyrimidine benzamide 2 was identified as a potent, modestly selective inhibitor of the B-Raf enzyme. Replacement of the benzamide with an aminoisoquinoline core significantly improved kinase selectivity and imparted favorable pharmacokinetic properties, leading to the identification of 1 as a potent antitumor agent in xenograft models.

B-Raf is a Ras-activated serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a central role in transducing signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKa) pathway (Ras/B-Raf/MEK/ ERK). This pathway has long been associated with human cancers due to frequent oncogenic mutations identified in its members.1 Ras mutations occur in 15% of cancers, and B-Raf is also mutated at high frequency in certain cancers including melanoma (66%), thyroid cancer (35-70%), colorectal cancer (5-20%), and ovarian cancer (30%).2 Over 45 B-Raf mutations have been described, but by far the most common mutation (90%) is Val600 f Glu in the activation loop. This mutation renders the kinase constitutively active. Given the high incidence of B-Raf mutations in melanoma, together with few effective treatments currently being available for metastatic melanoma, selectively targeting the mutant B-Raf pathway offers clinicians an attractive new approach to treating this deadly disease.3 There have been few reports to date of selective inhibitors of the mutant B-Raf pathway in an in vitro cellular setting that demonstrate robust antitumor efficacy in vivo against tumors driven by the mutant B-Raf pathway.4 We herein disclose work leading to the discovery of 1 as such an agent. A high-throughput screen against recombinant V600EB-Raf led to the identification of a series of pyridylpyrimidine and

related aminoquinazoline benzamides that potently inhibit the enzyme and potently inhibit downstream phosphorylation of ERK in the A375 human melanoma cell line bearing the V600E mutation in vitro. Compounds 2 and 3 are representative of these leads (Figure 1).5 While these leads were strong inhibitors of B-Raf,6 they also potently inhibited other kinases with smaller gatekeeper residues and known DFG-out binding modes, including p38R, KDR, Lck, and Tie-2 (Table 1).5,7 In addition, rat pharmacokinetic properties were suboptimal (short t1/2, moderate clearance, and generally low to modest bioavailability; Table 1). Modeling of 2 into the B-Raf crystal structure8 indicated that it is well accommodated in the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain of the protein, where the activation loop folds out (DFG-out)9 to open up an extended hydrophobic pocket in which the trifluoromethylaniline moiety forms favorable hydrophobic interactions. An examination of the amino acid residues surrounding the inhibitor 2 in B-Raf indicated a small unoccupied cleft in the vicinity of the conserved X-DFG motif at the start of the activation loop adjacent to the amide linkage of the benzamide of 2 (Figure 2 ). A glycine residue (Gly593) immediately precedes the DFG sequence in B-Raf (X=G), but for many other kinases the corresponding residue is larger (X=L, C, A, and A for p38R, KDR, Lck, and Tie-2, respectively). The resulting side chain from the residue X is directed toward this unoccupied cleft, and modeling suggested that filling this small unoccupied pocket would significantly improve the kinase selectivity of 2. The aminoisoquinoline 12a was therefore designed and prepared (Schemes 1 and 2) to achieve this while maintaining key hydrogen bonding interactions through the endocyclic and exocyclic nitrogens of the aminoisoquinoline to Asp594 and Glu501, respectively.6 The aminoisoquinoline 12a exhibited a reduction in activity against the recombinant B-Raf enzyme but was only slightly less active in inhibiting phosphorylation of ERK in an A375 cellular assay (Table 1). It has been noted elsewhere that Raf inhibitors can result in counterintuitive activation of Raf kinase activity;10 therefore, structure-activity relationships were principally derived from activity in the A375 cellular assay. Notably, activity of 12a against p38R and KDR was markedly attenuated, as predicted from the initial modeling studies with 2. Selectivity against Lck and Tie-2 was more modest as might be predicted from the smaller side chain of the alanine residue preceding the DFG motif in these kinases. However, a comparison of the extended hydrophobic pockets of the B-Raf, Lck, and Tie-2 structures suggested more room in the vicinity of the 4-position of the aniline side chain for

B-Raf compared with Lck and Tie-2 and therefore offered a potential way of further improving the kinase selectivity of 12a. The corresponding 4-chloroaniline 12b was therefore

prepared (Scheme 2). Not only did 12b demonstrate an improvement in activity against B-Raf while maintaining excellent selectivity against p38R and KDR, selectivity against Lck and Tie-2 was also markedly improved.6 A significant improvement in rat pharmacokinetics was noted in going from the benzamide 2 to the aminoisoquinoline 12a (Table 1). The aniline substituent was identified as a major source of oxidative metabolism/clearance, and changes to the aniline substitution pattern (12a f 12b) resulted in very favorable pharmacokinetic profiles (Table 1). To improve potency, attention was focused on the pyrimidine portion of the molecule. This forms a bidentate hydrogen bonding interaction in the hinge region of the B-Raf protein (i.e., between the pyrimidine N1 and Cys532 (NH) and between the pyrimidine C2-H and Gln530 (CdO)).11 It was reasoned that an additional hydrogen bond to Cys532 (CdO) would be accessible with the aminomethyl group of 13 (Scheme 2). This turned out to be detrimental to activity against the B-Raf enzyme but interestingly maintained potency in the A375 pERK cellular assay. However, this change was detrimental to selectivity, particularly against Lck and Tie-2. Further SAR exploration of the aniline substituent of 13 using analogous chemistry demonstrated the ability to modulate kinase selectivity with 14-16 while retaining equivalent B-Raf/A375 cellular activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties (Table 1).

Replacement of the aminopyridylpyrimidine portion of 13 with the aminoquinazoline fragment from the screening lead 3 gave the corresponding analogue 18 (Scheme 3). While 18 retained good activity against the B-Raf enzyme accompanied with good kinase selectivity, a notable drop in A375 cellular activity was observed. Cellular activity could be restored by varying the aniline substituent, for example with 19 and 20, but at the expense of kinase selectivity (Table 1). Rationalizing that rotational freedom of the aminomethyl group of 13-16 may have introduced an entropic penalty for binding to B-Raf, it was conformationally locked to form a purine. The corresponding pyridylpurine 1 was therefore prepared (Scheme 4). This resulted in a significant improvement in potency against the B-Raf enzyme and in the A375 pERK cellular assay (Table 1). A cocrystal structure of 1 with B-Raf revealed that the purine not only forms an additional hydrogen bonding interaction with Cys532 but also allows a favorable -stacking interaction with the side chain of Trp531 which is probably responsible for the bulk of the improvement in potency (Figure 3).12 Additionally, kinase selectivity relative to 13 was greatly increased and 1 displayed a very favorable rat pharmacokinetic profile.

A pharmacodynamic (PD) assay in mouse measuring tumor biochemical target coverage (in a dose and time dependent manner) in A375 tumor lysate was performed to help in designing dosing schedule for compounds in efficacy studies.13 The 6 h time point following oral dosing across multiple doses and compounds was found to be highly predictive of in vivo efficacy, as illustrated by the significant correlation (R2=0.86) observed between in vivo pERK inhibition and A375 tumor growth inhibition across all Raf inhibitors tested (Figure 4). Compound 1 was profiled in the A375 SQ2 xenograft model13 in mouse based on its in vitro potency, kinase selectivity, and favorable rat pharmacokinetic profile. Pharmacokinetics in mouse were similar to those observed in rat (CD1 mouse: t1/2= 3.3 h; CL=0.19 (L/h)/kg; Vss=1.1 L/kg; F=79%). The ability of 1 to modulate ERK phosphorylation levels in the tumor was demonstrated in the A375 PD assay, where a 2.5 mg/kg dose administered orally resulted in 69% inhibition of ERK phosphorylation 6 h following a single dose, and a 5.0 mg/kg dose resulted in a corresponding 77% inhibition. Repeat oral dosing in an established A375 xenograft model in mouse13,14 resulted in tumor growth inhibition with an ED50 of 1.3 mg/kg QD (AUC0-24h = 2.7 g 3 h/mL) and 85% tumor regression at 5 mg/kg QD (AUC0-24h=14 g 3 h/mL) after dosing for 14 days. In summary, a novel series of selective inhibitors of the mutant B-Raf pathway is disclosed. Identification of the lead compounds 2 and 3 as multikinase inhibitors that potently inhibited B-Raf kinase, combined with an understanding of how they bind in the target and off-target kinases, allowed a structure-based approach to guide the medicinal chemistry team. A relatively uncommon G-DFG motif in Raf provided

an opportunity for kinase selectivity that was exploited successfully with an aminoisoquinoline core. Additional selectivity was exploited through subtle differences in the extended hydrophobic pockets of the kinases, and potency was optimized through changes in the hinge-binding region through the introduction of a purine moiety. This led to the identification of 1 as a potent, highly selective inhibitor of Raf6 that demonstrates potent antitumor activity in an in vivo melanoma model driven by the mutant B-Raf pathway. Although 1 was apparently well tolerated, this group will present elsewhere data that suggest potent Raf inhibitors can lead to compensatory activation of the MAPK pathway with undesirable functional consequences observed in normal tissues and certain other non-B-Raf mutant tumor models in vivo.
