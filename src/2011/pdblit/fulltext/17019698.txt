ABSTRACT CcmG, also designated DsbE, functions as a periplasmic protein thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase and is required for cytochrome c maturation. Here we report the crystal structures of Escherichia coli CcmG and its two mutants, P144A and the N-terminal fifty seven-residue deletion mutant, and two additional deletion mutants were studied by circular dichroism. Structural comparison of E. coli CcmG with its deletion mutants reveals that the N-terminal b-sheet is essential for maintaining the folding topology and consequently maintaining the active-site structure of CcmG. Pro144 and Glu145 are key residues of the fingerprint region of CcmG. Pro144 is in cisconfiguration, and it makes van der Waals interactions with the active-site disulfide Cys80≠Cys83 and forms a C¿ . . .O hydrogen bond with Thr82, ¿H helping stabilize the active-site structure. Glu145 forms a salt-bridge and hydrogen-bond network with other residues of the fingerprint region and with Arg158, further stabilizing the active-site structure. The cis-configuration of Pro144 makes the backbone nitrogen and oxygen of Ala143 exposed to solvent, favorable for interacting with binding partners. The key role of cis-Pro144 is verified by the P144A mutant, which contains trans-Ala144 and displays redox property changes. Structural comparison of E. coli CcmG with the recently reported structure of CcmG in complex with the N-terminal domain of DsbD reveals that Tyr141 undergoes conformational changes upon binding DsbD. A cis-proline located at the N-terminus of the first b-strand of the bba motif of the thioredoxin-like domain is a conserved structural feature of the thioredoxin superfamily.

INTRODUCTION CcmG protein, encoded by one of the eight Escherichia coli cytochrome c maturation genes (ccmA-ccmH),1≠3 is especially required for the reducing pathway of cytochrome c maturation, which requires the reduction of two cysteine residues before the heme attachment. CcmG has also been designated DsbE, a member of the disulfide bond (Dsb) protein family.4,5 A broad variety of periplasmic protein thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases have been identified in E. coli, which contribute to the folding pathways of proteins and are involved in the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds, displaying either an oxidizing, a reducing, or an isomerization activity.3,4,6 For example, DsbD is a cytoplasmic transmembrane protein, and it catalyzes the reduction of DsbC, DsbE, and DsbG by a cascade of electron transfer reactions.3,7 Thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases share a C≠X≠X≠C motif as the active site, and the structures of

most of them are characterized by the thioredoxin (TRX)-like fold8 although they share very low primary sequence homology.3 Some additional functions, such as a chaperone-like activity independent of the cysteine residue, were also reported for the Dsb proteins.9≠11 E. coli CcmG is a membrane bound protein, which is anchored to cytoplasmic membrane by a highly hydrophobic N-terminus (residues 5≠25) and faces periplasm with its hydrophilic C-terminal TRX-like domain. The TRX-like domain contains a C≠X≠X≠C motif in the active site and a conserved sequence GVXGXPETF that has been identified to be the fingerprint of CcmG,2 but the role of the fingerprint region has not been reported yet. Based on mutagenic studies it was proposed that each of the active-site cysteines of CcmG was important for attachment of heme to apocytochrome c.2 However, the reaction mechanism is unknown, and the role of CcmG in cytochrome c maturation remains controversial. Both the E. coli CcmG protein (residues 19≠185) and the N-terminal fifty seven-residue deletion mutant of E. coli CcmG (residues 58≠185) were overexpressed and purified in our laboratory,12,13 which are referred to as CcmG-EC and D57CcmG, respectively, in this article. Here we report the crystal structures of CcmG-EC, D57CcmG, and the P144A mutant of CcmG-ECy , which reveal key roles of the N-terminal b-sheet and the fingerprint region. During the preparation of this article, the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of E. coli DsbD (nDsbD) in complex with CcmG (residues 43≠185) was reported.14 Here we compare the CcmG-EC structure with the nDsbD-CcmG complex structure and demonstrate conformational changes upon binding DsbD. A conserved structural feature of the TRX-superfamily is discussed.

Protein Expression and Purification The expression and purification of CcmG-EC and D57CcmG were previously reported.12,13 The P144A mutant and two additional deletion mutants of E. coli CcmG, D47CcmG, and D60CcmG, in which residues 1≠47 and 1≠60 were deleted, respectively, were similarly expressed and purified. Crystallization Single crystals of CcmG-EC were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. The protein solution contained 20 mg mL¿1 CcmG-EC, 25 mM TrisHCl (pH º 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA, and the reservoir solution consisted of 0.1M HEPES (pH º 7.8), 2.0M (NH4)2SO4, and 2% (w/v) PEG 4K.15 The P144A mutant was crystallized similarly, except that the concentrations of the protein and NaCl in the droplet were 12 mg mL¿1 and 50 mM, respectively, and the pH value of the reservoir solution was 8.0. D57CcmG crystallized as polycrystals at the conditions similar to those used for CcmG-EC, but the concentration of NaCl in the protein solution and that of (NH4)2SO4 in the reservoir solution decreased to 50 mM and 0.6≠0.8M, respectively. Single crystals of D57CcmG were grown using the streak-seeding technique at 293 K, followed by macroseeding. Composition of the reservoir solution used for seeding was similar to that used for vapor diffusion except that the concentration of (NH4)2SO4 decreased to 0.4≠0.6M for streak-seeding and 0.35≠0.4M for macroseeding. X-Ray Data Collection X-ray diffraction data of CcmG-EC, D57CcmG, and the P144A mutant were collected using a laboratory X-ray source equipped with a CCD detector, to 1.9, 2.6, and 2.2 ∞ A resolution, respectively. An additional data set of ∞ D57CcmG was collected to 1.9 A resolution at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The X-ray data were processed using the software HKL2000.16 Crystal data and the data collection statistics are shown in Table I. Structure Determination and Refinement The three-dimensional structure of CcmG-EC was determined by molecular replacement using the program CNS,17 and the molecular structure of CcmG-BJ (Arg50Leu193, corresponding to 43-180 of CcmG-EC)18 was used as the search model, in which the segment Gly62Lys79 containing a seven-residue insertion and a tworesidue deletion was omitted. The structure was refined using CNS, and the model building was carried out using the program TURBO-FRODO19 based on the (2Fo ¿ Fc) and (Fo ¿ Fc) electron density maps as well as the ∞ annealing ``omit'' maps20 at 2.5 A resolution. The missing segment Asn55-Gln67 was built during the refinement. The X-ray data were gradually extended up to 1.9 ∞ A resolution. Solvent molecules were added to the model at late stage of the refinement and only those with B

MATERIALS AND METHODS Site-Directed Mutagenesis The P144A mutant of CcmG-EC was prepared by sitedirected mutagenesis. Two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were generated using plasmid of CcmGEC as the DNA template. T7 promoter (F) and T7 promoter (R) were used as primers, with oligonucleotides 50 -AAACGTTTCCGCCGCGCCATAGACACCGAGATC-30 and 50 -TATGGCGCGGCGGAAACGTTTCTTATTGAC-30 at the desired mutation sites, respectively. The two gene fragments were amplified by PCR using the two T7 promoters to generate a full-length gene product, incorporating the P144A mutation. This PCR product was then digested with BamH I and Nde I and ligated into pET-3a expression vector to produce the pETP144A plasmid, which was verified by DNA sequencing and was transformed into E. coli cell strain BL21(DE3).

∞ values less than 50 A2 were included in the final model. The polypeptide chain was extended towards the N- and C-termini. Finally, dual conformations were established for a few residues and the structure was further refined. The structure of D57CcmG was determined by molecular replacement by applying the program AmoRe21 of the CCP4 Suite22 and using the refined structure of CcmG-EC (residues 58≠184) as the search model. Crystallographic refinement was then carried out using CNS. The X-ray data were gradually extended, using the data ∞ sets 1 and 2 successively, up to 1.9 A resolution. The P144A mutant structure was determined by the difference Fourier method using CNS, based on the CcmG-EC structure in which Pro144 and Ala143 were omitted. One round of simulated annealing and temperature factor refinement led to a (Fo ¿ Fc) difference ∞ electron density map at 2.2 A resolution. Ala143 and trans-Ala144 were fitted to the map and refined well, whereas when cis-Ala144 was tested, it displayed strong positive and negative electron density in the (Fo ¿ Fc) difference electron density map after further refinement. Circular Dichroism Measurement Each of the four proteins, CcmG-EC, D57CcmG, D47CcmG, and D60CcmG, was diluted with a buffer (20

mM Tris-HCl, 25 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) to a concentration of $0.2 mg/mL. The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. The pathlength of the cuvette was 0.1 cm, and the spectra were recorded over 190≠250 nm with a scan speed of 10 nm/min and a time constant of 0.25 s. The data were further processed for signal averaging, noise reduction, and baseline subtraction. The spectra were presented as mean residue molar ellipticities. Redox Potential Determination by Fluorescence Measurement For each of CcmG-EC and the P144A mutant, the standard redox potential was determined by measuring the redox state-dependent fluorescence emission from the CcmG/glutathione reaction system.12,23 The reduced glutathione (GSH) and the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were purchased from Roche, and the other reagents were of analytical grade. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford method,24 and 0.5 lM protein was incubated at 308 for 15 h under nitrogen atmosphere in a reaction buffer containing 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM GSSG, and GSH at different concentrations in the range of 0≠75 mM.

Overall Structure of CcmG-EC The amino acid sequence of CcmG-EC is shown in Figure 1, which is aligned with the sequences of the CcmG homologue from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (CcmG-BJ) and the DsbE protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb DsbE). The polypeptide chain of CcmG-EC consists of a TRX-like fold and two inserts, an N-terminal insert, and a central insert (Fig. 1). The side chains of five residues, Val71, Arg84, Ser114, Trp115, Trp176, exhibit dual conformations, most of which are located at the molecular surface.

In the final structure model of CcmG-EC each molecule contains 149 amino acid residues (Leu36-Ala184). The N-terminal segment Ala19-Asn35 is disordered, and the C-terminal Gln185 displayed poor electron density and could not be located. The crystal structure of CcmG-EC shows that each molecule contains two domains, an N-terminal domain (Leu36-Gln67), and a C-terminal TRX-like domain (Gly68-Ala184). The secondary structures consist of four a-helices, one 310 helix and two b-sheets, as shown in Figures 1 and 2 (a). ba is a two-stranded antiparallel bsheet, which, along with the 310 helix, forms the main body of the N-terminal domain. bb is a five-stranded bsheet: the middle strand bb¿1 starts from Gly68 and forms a big b-bulge at Lys69 and Pro70; bb¿2, bb¿3 are on one side and bb¿4, bb¿5 on the other side; bb¿1, bb¿2,

bb¿3 are parallel to each other and bb¿1, bb¿4, bb¿5 are antiparallel to each other. The typical TRX-fold8 is characterized by a bab motif and a bba motif linked by a short helix to form a four-stranded b-sheet surrounded by three helices. In the CcmG-EC structure, the bab (bb¿1, a1, bb¿2) motif and bba (bb¿4, bb¿5 and a4) motif are linked by a2, bb¿3, and a3, forming the TRX-like domain. In this domain a3 corresponds to the helical linker of the typical TRX-fold; a2 and bb¿3 constitute an additional linking region. The overall structure of CcmG-EC is similar to the known structures of CcmG-BJ18 and Mtb DsbE,26 with ∞ the root-mean-square deviations (rmsd) of 2.2 A and 2.1 ∞ for 144 and 130 Ca atoms, respectively. CcmG-EC A structure contains a longer N-terminus than the other two structures. An acidic environment of the active site and a groove formed by two inserts of the TRX-like fold were reported to be two unique structural features of CcmG-BJ required for the biological activity,18 however, neither of them is observed in the CcmG-EC structure. The three acidic residues Asp97, Glu158, Glu98 of CcmG-BJ correspond to Ala85, Glu145, and Glu86 of CcmG-EC. Ala85 is a hydrophobic residue. Glu86 constitutes a part of the wall of the active-site cleft, but the shortest distance from its carboxyl group to the active∞ site disulfide is 4.9 A, and Glu86 is far from the binding ∞ interface ($10 A), as shown in the nDsbD-CcmG complex structure. Glu145 and another acidic residue Asp162 point away from the disulfide, with distances of ∞ 10 and 8.5 A, respectively, and their carboxyl groups are ∞ not involved in binding nDsbD (6.6 and 5.3 A, respectively). Overall Structure of D57CcmG Each D57CcmG molecule consists of 128 amino acid residues (Gln58≠Gln185). There are two b-sheets in the D57CcmG molecule, as shown in Figures 1 and 2(b).
PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

Like in CcmG-EC, bb is a b-sheet consisting of five bstrands. However, the other b-sheet, ba, is very different from that in CcmG-EC. In the CcmG-EC structure ba is an anti-parallel b-sheet and both b-strands of ba are formed by the N-terminal residues, but in the D57CcmG structure ba is composed of two parallel b-strands, ba¿1 (Gln58-Ala62) from the N-terminal region and ba¿2 (Gly132-Leu134) from the residues between the bab motif and the bba motif of the TRX-like domain. As shown in Figure 1, ba¿1 of D57CcmG corresponds to ba¿2 of CcmG-EC but the former is a little longer, and the segment following this b-strand is a one-turn a helix in D57CcmG and a 310 helix in CcmG-EC. In addition, the bb¿1 strand following this helix is correspondingly shorter in D57CcmG than in CcmG-EC. a3 of CcmG-EC does not exist in D57CcmG, and the N-terminal part of it (Gly132-Leu134) turns out to be ba¿2 in D57CcmG. The different folding topology gives rise to striking differences in the tertiary structure between D57CcmG and CcmG-EC, especially in the regions of Gln58-Gln67 and Leu127-Glu145. Structure Comparison of CcmG-EC With its Deletion Mutants by CD Studies Figure 3 shows the far-UV CD spectra of CcmG-EC and its three deletion mutants, D57CcmG, D47CcmG, and D60CcmG. CcmG-EC exhibits a negative peak at 223 nm and a shoulder at 208 nm, while D57CcmG gives a weaker negative peak around 218 nm, suggesting a decrease of the content of the helices in D57CcmG compared with that in CcmG-EC, which is consistent with the crystal structures of them. CcmG-EC and D47CcmG present similar far-UV CD spectra, and the spectra of D57CcmG and D60CcmG are similar to each other, indicating similar secondary structures of each pair. It implies that the deletion of residues 48≠57, where ba¿1 is located, results in remarkable changes in the secondary structures and the folding topology. Structures of Active Site and the Fingerprint Region Figure 2(a) shows an active site cleft of the CcmG-EC structure. The main chain conformation of Cys80-Pro81Thr82-Cys83 is a b-turn, and Cys80 and Cys83 form an active-site disulfide bridge [Fig. 4(a)], indicating that CcmG-EC is in oxidized state. Cys80 is exposed to solvent whereas Cys83 is buried. The disulfide is located at bottom of the cleft, capped by Pro144. Pro144 is in cisconfiguration [Fig. 4(a)] and is located at the N-terminus of the first b-strand of the bba motif. The cis-peptide and the side chain of Pro144 make extensive van der Waals interactions with the active-site disulfide, as shown in Figure 4(a), and the side-chain atom CD of Pro144 makes a C¿ ¡ ¡O hydrogen bond with the ¿H¡ ∞ hydroxyl oxygen atom OG1 of Thr82 (3.2 A), which is shown in Figure 4(b). These interactions help stabilize the active-site disulfide. In addition, the cis-configuration of Pro144 makes the backbone nitrogen and oxygen of

Ala143 exposed to solvent, favorable for interacting with its binding partner. This is verified by the nDsbD-CcmG complex structure in which Ala143 of CcmG forms a pair of backbone hydrogen bonds with Cys109 of nDsbD.14 cis-Pro144 is located in a region with conserved sequence GVXGXPETF (139≠147), which has been identified to be the fingerprint for CcmG subfamily.2,3 This region forms the N-terminal half of bb¿4 and a loop between a3 and bb¿4, the main chain of which makes two turns of $908 at Tyr141 and cis-Pro144. Glu145 is a conserved residue in the fingerprint region and is adjacent to cis-Pro144, which forms a salt-bridge and hydrogen-bond network with the surrounding residues. As shown in Figure 4(b), the OE1 and OE2 atoms of Glu145 make salt bridge and hydrogen bond interactions with NE and NH1 of Arg158 and form hydrogen bonds with the main-chain nitrogen atoms of two fingerprint residues, Tyr141 and Gly142. Arg158 NH2 is hydrogen bonded to the backbone oxygen atoms of both Gly139 and Glu37. In addition, atoms CB, CG, and CD of Arg158 make van der Waals interactions with the phenyl ring of another conserved residue Phe147 of the fingerprint region. These interactions help maintain cisPro144 at an appropriate position to stabilize the activesite structure. Tyr141 Changes Conformation Upon Binding nDsbD In the fingerprint region residues Thr146-Phe147 are buried, and Gly139-Glu145 are exposed to solvent. Among the latter part Tyr141 makes hydrogen-bond interactions with nDsbD.14 As shown in Figure 4(c), when CcmG binds nDsbD, the side chain of Tyr141 of CcmG undergoes conformational changes to form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Ser9 and the backbone oxygen of Phe11 of nDsbD. To avoid close contacts with Tyr141, Arg158 of the CcmG also changes conformation so that its NH1 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain oxygen of Leu138, whereas the conformation of Glu145 does not change obviously. The N-Terminal Fifty Seven-Residue Deletion Destroys the Active-Site Structure Figure 4(d) shows the active-site structure of D57CcmG compared with that of CcmG-EC. The segment Cys80-Pro81-Thr82-Cys83 does not show obvious changes in its position and conformation, and Cys80Cys83 of D57CcmG displays strong electron density characteristic of a disulfide bridge, indicating that it is in oxidized state. It is noteworthy that the fingerprint region is located in the segment Leu127-Glu145 that shows striking differences between D57CcmG and CcmG-EC, as described above. Pro144 remains in cis∞ configuration, however, its Ca atom moves by 1.6 A, and ∞ Cb and Cg atoms by $3 A, compared with those in the CcmG-EC structure. The distances form cis-Pro144 to the Cys80≠Cys83 disulfide in D57CcmG are consequently longer than that in CcmG-EC, generally larger

∞ ∞ than 4.4 A except for a distance of 4.0 A between the sulfur atom of Cys80 and the Cb atom of Pro144, which suggests that the van der Waals interactions between the disulfide and cis-Pro144 are destroyed in this dele¿H¡ tion mutant. The C¿ ¡ ¡O hydrogen bond between Pro144 and Thr82 does not exist in D57CcmG either. Resulting from the conformational changes of the backbone of the fingerprint region, the amide nitrogen of Ala143 of D57CcmG is no longer solvent-accessible and ∞ the carbonyl oxygen of Ala143 moves upward by 3.5 A, so that Ala143 would not form a pair of hydrogen bonds with nDsbD, suggested by the superposition of CcmGEC with the nDsbD-CcmG complex. Compared with CcmG-EC, the Ca atom of Tyr141 in D57CcmG shows a ∞ movement of 5.5 A and its side chain changes orientation [Fig. 4(d)], so that it would not interact with nDsbD without major changes in main-chain conformation in this region. In the D57CcmG structure the salt-bridge and hydrogen-bond network involving Glu145 is disrupted except that the Glu145 OE1 atom forms salt bridges with the Arg158 NE and NH2 atoms. It is suggested that the deletion of the N-terminal b-strand results in the structure changes in the fingerprint region and consequently destabilize the active-site structure.

The P144A Mutant Displays a Cis- to Trans-Configuration Change and Redox Property Changes The overall structure of the P144A mutant is basically the same as the wild-type protein CcmG-EC. Compared with CcmG-EC, the local conformations at the active site Cys80-Pro81-Thr82-Cys83 and in the fingerprint region do not display obvious changes. In the P144A mutant structure the segment Tyr141-Glu145 shows an upward movement, and the segment Cys80-Glu86 moves accordingly, so that the relative positions between them do not change significantly. When cis-Pro144 is mutated to alanine, Ala144 adopts trans-configuration, exhibiting a cisto trans-configuration change at the mutation site. As shown in Figure 5, the Ala144 Cb atom is in van der Waals contact with the sulfur atom of Cys83, however, the van der Waals interactions are less extensive than those in the wild-type protein because of the configuration change of the peptide and the replacement of the five-member ring by one atom, suggesting that the active-site disulfide is less stable in P144A than in CcmG-EC. In the P144A mutant Cb atom of Ala144, instead of the CD atom of Pro144 in Ccmg-EC, forms a C¿ ¡ ¡O hydrogen bond with the OG1 atom of Thr82 ¿H¡ ∞ (3.1 A). Compared with the wild-type protein, the carbonyl group of Ala143 rotates by $608 and becomes less solvent-accessible and unfavorable for interacting with the binding partner. The superposition of the P144A mutant with the nDsbD-CcmG complex demonstrates that ∞ the Ala143 oxygen of the mutant is 4.7 A away from the Cys109 nitrogen of nDsbD, beyond the hydrogen bonding distance, while the hydrogen bond between the amDOI 10.1002/prot

ide nitrogen of Ala143 of the mutant and the carbonyl oxygen of Ser109 of nDsbD still remains (Fig. 5). The reduced CcmG displays stronger fluorescence emission than the oxidized CcmG since the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan is quenched by the active-site disulfide nearby.12,23 As shown in Figure 6, the P144A mutant is easier to be reduced by GSH than CcmG-EC, leading to an increase of the relative amount of the reduced state. The equilibrium constants Keq for the CcmG/glutathione system are 1.14 3 10¿1M and 1.80 3 10¿2M, and the standard redox potentials are ¿0.178 and ¿0.155 V, for the wild-type CcmG-EC and the P144A mutant, respectively. The redox potential change indicates a decrease of the reduction activity resulting from the mutation, which agrees well with the less stability of the active-site disulfide suggested by the weaker van der Waals interactions between the mutation site and the disulfide, as shown in the P144A mutant structure. Experimentally, the changes in the redox potential support the role of the fingerprint region in stabilizing the active-site disulfide. DISCUSSION N-Terminal b-Sheet is Essential for Maintaining Folding Topology and Active-Site Structure The crystal structure of CcmG-EC consists of a TRXlike fold (Gly68-Lys106 and Gly132-Gln185) as well as an N-terminal insert (Ala36-Gln67, containing a twostranded b-sheet and a 310 helix) and a central insert (Asp107-Asp131) (Fig. 1). The structure comparison of D57CcmG with CcmG-EC in combination with CD spectra of the three deletion mutants of CcmG indicates that deletion of either one or two b-strands of the N-terminal b-sheet (ba) gives rise to remarkable changes in secondary structure, which suggests that the N-terminal bsheet is essential for maintaining the CcmG folding topology and consequently stabilizing the active-site structure and maintaining the biological activity of CcmGEC. This conclusion well agrees with the recently reported experimental results: the deletion mutant

D42CcmG (with an N-terminal deletion of 42 residues) contained the intact ba-sheet and it stably bound nDsbD,14 whereas the deletions of DLeu24-Thr66 and DAsp31-Gln67 made the two mutants unable to complement cytochrome c maturation, in both of which the whole ba sheet was deleted.27 The Fingerprint Residue Cis-Pro144 and Glu145 Play Key Roles in Stabilizing the Active-Site Structure The conserved sequence GVXGXPETF(139-147) was previously identified to be the fingerprint region of the CcmG subfamily, however, its role was unclear. The CcmG-EC structure revels that the fingerprint residue Pro144 is in cis-configuration, and the cis-Pro144 helps stabilize the active-site structure by making extensive van der Waals interactions with the active-site disulfide and forming a C-H¡ ¡ ¡O hydrogen bond with Thr82. The cis-configuration of Pro144 also makes its adjacent residue Ala143 form a pair of main-chain hydrogen bonds with nDsbD. These structural features demonstrate that cis-Pro144 plays key roles in stabilizing the active-site structure of CcmG and favoring the interaction with the binding partner. This conclusion is verified by the structure and the redox property of the P144A mutant. The fingerprint residue Glu145 forms a salt-bridge and hydrogen-bond network, helping maintain the appropriate position of cis-Pro144 and further stabilize the active-site structure. Tyr141 is also an important fingerprint residue, which exhibits conformational change and forms interprotein hydrogen bonds when CcmG binds nDsbD. A Conserved Structural Feature of the TRX-Superfamily The three-dimensional structures of some other members of the Dsb protein family, such as DsbA,28 DsbC,29 DsbG,30 and the C-terminal domain of DsbD31 were

reported. Each of them contains a TRX-like domain, and the superposition of the TRX-like domain of CcmG-EC with those of the other members of the Dsb protein fam∞ ily give rmsd values in the range of 2.5≠2.9 A for 92 Ca atoms. The folding topology of DsbA is very different from those of the other members of the family since a helical domain is inserted between the bab motif and the bba motif of the TRX-like domain in DsbA.28 However, around the active site C≠X≠X≠C and the capped cis-proline the structures of CcmG-EC and DsbA are similar to each other. The cis-peptide and the Pro151 side chain of DsbA make van der Waals interactions with the active-site disulfide but no C¿ ¡ ¡O hydrogen ¿H¡ bond exists between them. The P151A mutant of DsbA32 shows a cis- to trans-configuration change at the mutation site, similar to the change observed in the P144A mutant of CcmG. But unlike the latter, the backbone of the Gly149-Ala152 loop in the DsbA P151A mutant structure shows a global rearrangement, which results in a complete loss of the van der Waals interactions with the active site disulfide. In addition, the side chain of His32 shows a great conformational change in the P151A mutant of DsbA. It was reported that P151A mutant showed lower protein stability and enzymatic activity than the wild-type DsbA. Recently, other mutational alterations of DsbA were reported to result in accumulation of enzymatic reaction intermediates.33 In the nDsbD-CcmG complex structure there is a pair of backbone hydrogen bonds between Ala143 of CcmG and Cys109 of nDsbD, as described above. Ala143 is the residue preceding cis-Pro144 in the sequence. We examined the known structures of complexes of other members of the TRX-superfamily and found out that these structural features are conserved in these complexes. For example, in the DsbC-nDsbD complex structure34 cis-Pro183 of DsbC is close to the active site Cys98, and Thr182 forms a pair of backbone hydrogen bonds with Cys109 of nDsbD. When the nDsbD molecules in the two complexes nDsbD-CcmG and DsbC-nDsbD superimpose with each other, the CcmG/DsbC backbone of the loop containing the active-site disulfide (Ala77-Ser83 of CcmG) and the middle part of the fingerprint region (Tyr141-Glu145 of CcmG) in the two structures also ∞ superimpose quite well, with rmsd of less than 1.5 A. The rmsd values between the Ca atoms of cis-Pro144, Ala143, Cys80 of CcmG and those of the corresponding residues cis-Pro183, Thr182, Cys98 of DsbC are in the ∞ range of 0.5≠0.7 A, and those between the Ca atom of Ser83 (mutated from Cys83) of CcmG and that of Ser101 ∞ (mutated form Cys101) of DsbC is 1.2 A. The similarity in the active-site disulfide, the cis-proline loop, and the pair of hydrogen bonds with nDsbD, between the two complexes, are shown in Figure 5. We recently reported the crystal structure of human j class glutathione transferase, in which cis-Pro184 is close to the active site Ser16, and Leu183 forms a pair of hydrogen bonds with the oxidized product of its substrate glutathione, and these structural features are conserved in various glutathione transferase complexes.35

Furthermore, when we examined the structures of other members of the Dsb protein family as well as many other proteins belonging to the TRX-superfamily, such as thioredoxin,36 glutaredoxin,37 and disulfide protein isomerase,38 it was found out that each of them contains a cis-proline near the active site, and the backbone nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the residue preceding the cis-proline are exposed to solvent, favorable for forming complexes by making a pair of hydrogen bonds to the binding partners. All of these cis-proline residues are located near the active site and at a conserved position relative to the TRX-like fold, i.e. at the N-terminus of the first b-strand of the bba motif of the TRX-like fold, which is a conserved structural feature of the TRX-superfamily and appears essential for interactions with the binding partner.

CONCLUSIONS The crystal structures of E. coli CcmG and its two mutants reveal that the N-terminal b-sheet is essential for maintaining the folding topology of CcmG and consequently maintaining the active-site structure, and the fingerprint region, especially cis-Pro144 and Glu145, plays key roles in stabilizing the active-site structure. The structural comparison of E. coli CcmG with the nDsbD-CcmG complex demonstrates a conformational change of Tyr141 upon binding DsbD. A cis-proline residue located at the first b-strand of the bba motif of the TRX-like fold is found to be a conserved structural feature of the TRX-superfamily, which appears essential for interacting with the binding partners.
