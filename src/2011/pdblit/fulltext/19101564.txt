West Nile virus methyltransferase catalyzes N7 and 2-O methylations of the viral RNA cap (GpppARNA  m7GpppAm-RNA). The two methylation events are independent, as evidenced by efficient N7 methylation of GpppA-RNA  m7GpppA-RNA and GpppAm-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA, and by the 2-O methylation of GpppARNA  GpppAm-RNA and m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA. However, the 2-O methylation activity prefers substrate m7GpppA-RNA to GpppA-RNA, thereby determining the dominant methylation pathway as GpppARNA  m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA. Mutant enzymes with different methylation defects can trans complement one another in vitro. Furthermore, sequential treatment of GpppA-RNA with distinct methyltransferase mutants generates fully methylated m7GpppAm-RNA, demonstrating that separate molecules of the enzyme can independently catalyze the two cap methylations in vitro. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Many members of the genus Flavivirus are significant human pathogens, including West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (Lindenbach and Rice, 2001). The plus-strand RNA genome of flavivirus contains a 5-terminal cap 1 structure (m7GpppAm) (Cleaves and Dubin, 1979; Wengler and Gross, 1978). Cap formation on eukaryotic mRNA entails four enzymatic reactions, in which the 5-triphosphate of the nascent RNA is cleaved to a diphosphate by an RNA triphosphatase, capped with GMP by an RNA guanylyltransferase, methylated at the N7 position of the cap guanosine by an RNA guanine-methyltransferase (N7 MTase), and methylated at the ribose 2-OH positions of the first and/or second nucleotides of RNA by a nucleoside 2-O MTase (Furuichi and Shatkin, 2000; Shuman, 2001). Since host mRNA capping occurs in the nucleus, viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, such as flaviviruses, encode their own capping apparatus. For flaviviruses, the RNA triphosphatase and MTase are respectively located in the C-terminus of NS3 (Bartelma and Padmanabhan, 2002; Wengler and Wengler, 1993) and the Nterminus of NS5 (Egloff et al., 2002; Ray et al., 2006), whereas the location of the guanylyltransferase remains elusive.

We recently found that a single MTase of flavivirus performs both the N7 and 2-O methylations of the viral RNA cap (Ray et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007). In WNV, the two cap methylations require distinct RNA elements within the 5-terminal stem-loop of the genomic RNA (Dong et al., 2007). Incubation of unmethylated GpppA-RNA substrate with flavivirus MTase in the presence SAM at high pH (pH 9­10) sequentially generated products GpppA-RNA  m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA. These results indicate that (i) the two methylation events are sequential; and (ii) 2-O methylation may be dependent on prior N7 methylation. Optimization of assay conditions showed that the N7 and 2-O methylations require different pH, pH 7 and 9­10, respectively (Zhou et al., 2007). At pH 7, the N7 methylation is optimal, but no 2-O methylation can occur. At pH 9­10, 2-O methylation is optimal, and N7 methylation occurs at about 30­50% of the optimal activity (measured at pH 7.0). The distinct assay conditions could be used to separate the two methylation events. Specifically, the N7 methylation can be measured by conversion of GpppA-RNA  m7GpppA-RNA at pH 7; no 2-O methylation would occur under this condition. The 2-O methylation can be monitored by conversion of m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA; no N7 methylation would occur under this condition, because the substrate has already been methylated at the guanine N7 position. These assays have allowed us to dissect mutational effects of the MTase on the two methylation events (Dong et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2007). Crystal structures of flavivirus MTases (Assenberg et al., 2007; Egloff et al., 2002; Mastrangelo et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007) exhibit distinct binding sites for S-adenosyl-L-homocycteine (SAH), GTP, and

RNA (Fig. 1A). The binding site for SAH, the byproduct from Sadenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) after transfer of its methyl group, was assumed to be the binding site for the methyl donor SAM. The RNA cap is bound at the GTP site, as evidenced by co-crystal structures of MTase complexed with cap analogues (Assenberg et al., 2007; Egloff et al., 2002, 2007). The RNA-binding site was proposed to interact with the 5-terminal region of RNA (Zhou et al., 2007). Despite the single known binding site for SAM, flavivirus MTase performs two distinct methylation reactions. Therefore, the substrate GpppA-RNA must be repositioned so as to accept the N7 and 2-OH methyl groups from SAM. In the repositioning model, guanine N7 of GpppA-RNA is first positioned next to SAM to generate m7GpppA-RNA, after which the m7G moiety is repositioned to the GTP-binding pocket so as to precisely register the 2-OH of the adenosine to the SAM molecule, resulting in m7GpppAm-RNA (Zhou et al., 2007). The molecular repositioning model was supported by mutagenesis results showing that two distinct sets of amino acids on the surface of the WNV MTase are required for the two methylation reactions (Dong et al., 2008). One key question looming is what determines the sequential N7 and 2-O methylations of the flavivirus RNA cap. The goal of this study is to analyze the relationship between the N7 and 2-O methylations during WNV cap formation. We report, for the first time, that N7 methylation could efficiently occur using substrates that are either 2-O unmethylated (GpppA-RNA) or 2-O methylated (GpppAm-RNA). In contrast, 2-O methylation prefers a substrate that is N7 methylated (m7GpppA-RNA) to a substrate that is N7 unmethylated (GpppA-RNA). The results suggest that the preference for the substrate with prior N7 methylation during 2-methylation is the determinant for sequential methylations of flavivirus RNA cap.

Results Distinct mutant MTases During the course of study of flavivirus MTase, we have identified a panel of WNV mutant MTases in which several single Alasubstitutions could each cause a defect in either N7 or 2-O methylation. Fig. 1 shows four such mutants: E34A and E218A were competent in N7 methylation, but defective in 2-O methylation; whereas R84A and E149A were defective in N7 methylation, but competent in 2-O methylation. The N7 and 2-O methylation activities of these mutant MTases (Fig. 1B) were previously quantified through thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of the GpppARNA  m7GpppA-RNA and m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA reactions, respectively. On the crystal structure of the WNV MTase (Fig. 1A), E34 and R84 are within the RNA-binding site; E149 is adjacent to SAH molecule, and is above the RNA-binding site; and E218 is within the active site of 2-O methylation (K61-D146-K182E218 tetrad), and is located between the GTP- and SAH-binding sites. These four mutants, together with the wild-type (WT) MTase, were used in this study to analyze the relationship between the two methylation events. The 2-O methylation is independent of the N7 methylation, but it does prefer a substrate with prior N7 methylation To examine whether 2-O methylation is dependent on prior N7 methylation, we performed a time-course study of the methylation, using two N7-defective mutants (R84A and E149A) and the WT MTase on the substrates GpppA-RNA and m7GpppA-RNA (representing the first 190 nucleotides of the WNV genome; "" indicates that the following phosphate is 32P-labeled). The reactions were performed at pH 9 buffer, which is optimal for 2-O methylation and supports about 50% of the optimal N7 methylation activity (Zhou et al., 2007). Vaccinia virus VP39, a well-characterized 2-O MTase, was included as a positive control. The methylation reactions were treated with nuclease P1 (to release cap structures) and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (to remove terminal phosphate). The reaction mixtures were then analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gel (Fig. 2A). We chose high percentage gel, rather than TLC, to improve the resolution of the detection method (i.e., to clearly separate four different cap structures: GpppA, m7GpppA, GpppAm, and m7GpppAm). Similar to VP39, mutants R84A and E149A could each perform 2-O methylation on both GpppA-RNA and m7GpppA-RNA substrates, demonstrating that the 2-O methylation is independent of the N7 methylation. However, the 2-O methylation was more efficient when the m7GpppA-RNA substrate, rather than the GpppA-RNA substrate, was used; this difference was more dramatic for the control VP39 than those for the R84A and E149A mutants (Fig. 2B). For the WT MTase, the conversion of GpppA-RNA  m7GpppARNA  m7GpppAm-RNA was detected; however, small amount of GpppAm-RNA product was also detected on the gel. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the 2-O methylation is not absolutely dependent on the N7 methylation, but it does prefer a substrate with prior N7 methylation. Two mutant MTases with different methylation defects, but not mutants with the same methylation defect, can complement one another in trans We examined whether two mutant enzymes with different methylation defects can complement one another, converting the unmethylated GpppA-RNA to the fully methylated m7GpppAm-RNA product. As shown in Fig. 3A, E149A alone (lane 2) converted GpppA-RNA to GpppAm-RNA, but almost no other products, confirming that the E149A MTase is competent in 2'-O methylation, but defective in N7 methylation. In contrast, E34A (lane 3) or E218A

Fig. 2. Analysis of 2-O methylation. (A) Time-course analysis of 2-O methylation of WNV MTase (R84A and E149A mutants, and WT) and vaccinia virus VP39 (as a positive control) on substrates GpppA-RNA and m7GpppA-RNA. Except for VP39, methylation reactions were performed in a 2-O buffer for WT, R84A, and E149A MTases. After incubation for indicated time periods, the reactions were treated with nuclease P1 and CIP. The methylation mixtures were then analyzed on a 20% PAGE containing 8 M urea. The enzyme, RNA substrate, and methylation time are indicated above the gel. See experimental details in Materials and Methods. The 32P-labeled cap analogue markers, GpppA and m7GpppA, were also analyzed on the gel. The positions of GpppA, m7GpppA, GpppAm, and m7GpppAm molecules are labeled to the left of the gel. (B) Quantification of the 2-O methylation activity. Except for WT MTase, the percentages of conversion for GpppA-RNA  GpppAm-RNA and m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA in (A) were quantified using PhosphorImager. Conversion percentage = product / (residual substrate + product) × 100%. For the WT MTase, only the m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA conversion was quantified; the GpppA-RNA  GpppAmRNA conversion is not presented because the enzyme can methylate both the N7 and 2-O positions.

(lane 4) alone dominantly converted GpppA-RNA to m7GpppARNA, indicating that these two mutants are defective in 2'-O methylation, but competent in N7 methylation. Due to a long incubation time (2 h), a weak 2'-O methylation activity was observed for E34A, as indicated by the m7GpppAm band (lane 3). Remarkably, incubation of GpppA-RNA with E149A and E34A (lanes 5-7), or with E149A and E218A (lanes 8-10), generated the m7G*pppAmRNA product. For each mutant pair, three different schemes of MTase addition/incubation were tested: two schemes entailed incubation of the G*pppA-RNA with one mutant for 1 h, followed by addition and incubation with the second mutant for another hour (i.e., E149AE34A, E34AE149A, E149AE218A, and E218AE149A); the third scheme involved in simultaneous addition and incubation of the two mutant enzymes for 2 h (i.e., E149A+E34A and E149A+E218A). Although the yields of m7G*pppAm-RNA varied slightly among three different schemes, the results clearly suggested that two distinct mutant MTses can trans complement to convert G*pppA-RNAm7G*pppAmRNA. Notably, there was considerable difference in the ratio of m7G*pppA and GpppAm products, depending on which mutant enzyme was incubated first (compare lanes 5 versus 6 and lanes 8 versus 9 in Fig. 3A). Because all reactions had an excess amount of input substrate GpppA-RNA (as indicated by unreacted GpppA-RNA molecule on the gel), the first added enzyme had one extra hour to catalyze its methylation than the second added enzyme did. Therefore, the first added enzyme produced an excess amount of its methylated product.

Next, we tested whether two mutants with the same methylation defects can trans complement one another (Fig. 3B). Incubation of GpppA-RNA with R84A alone, E149A alone, or R84A + E149 (both defective in N7 methylation) generated GpppAm-RNA in the pH 9 buffer (optimal for 2-O methylation), but did not yield any m7GpppA-RNA or m7GpppAm-RNA (lanes 8­10), even in the pH 7 buffer (optimal for N7 methylation; lanes 2­4). These results demonstrate that two distinct N7-defective mutants can not trans complement to restore the N7 methylation activity. Reciprocally, incubation of GpppA-RNA with E34A alone, E218A alone, or E34A + E218A (both defective in 2-O methylation) generated m7GpppA-RNA at pH 7 buffer, but did not yield any m7GpppAm-RNA or GpppAm-RNA (lanes 11­13). In the pH 9 buffer, E34A (lanes 5) alone and E34A + E218A (lane 7) generated small amount of m7GpppAm-RNA, due to residual 2-O methylation activity of the E34A MTase. The results demonstrate that two distinct 2-O-defective mutants can not complement to catalyze the 2-O methylation. Taken together, the results presented under this section strongly suggest that only mutants defective in different methylations, but not mutants defective in same methylation, can complement one another in trans. The GpppAm-RNA can be further methylated at the guanine N7 position to yield m7GpppAm-RNA The weak activity of N7 methylation-independent 2-O methylation (i.e., GpppA-RNA  GpppAm-RNA) indicates an alternative

(A) Trans complementation of two mutant MTases defective in N7 or 2-O methylation. Substrate GpppA-RNA was incubated with mutant MTase alone (E149A, E34A, or E218A) or with a pair of mutant MTases (E149A and E34A, or E149A and E218A) in the presence of SAM in the 2-O buffer. For each pair of mutant MTases, three different schemes were used for addition/incubation: two sequentialincubation schemes, and one simultaneous incubation scheme (see text for details). The reactions were digested with nuclease P1 and CIP, and the products were resolved on a high percentage denaturing gel. The mock- and WT MTase-treated samples were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. The migrations of GpppA, m7GpppA, GpppAm, and m7GpppAm are labeled to the right side of the gel. (B) No trans complementation of two mutant MTases defective in the same type of methylation. Substrate GpppA-RNA was methylated with indicated mutant MTase alone or with a pair of mutant MTases harboring the same type of methylation defect (R84A + E149, both defective in N7 methylation; E34A + E218A, both defective in 2-O methylation). The methylation reactions were incubated 22 °C for 1 h in both pH 7 buffer (optimal for N7 methylation) and pH 9 buffer (optimal for 2-Omethylation). The amounts of MTases are indicated for each reaction. The reaction mixtures were resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. (C) Independent N7 and 2-Omethylations by two mutant MTases. Substrate GpppA-RNA was incubated with mutant R84A in the 2-O buffer for 30 min, resulting in GpppAm-RNA. After removal of the R84A MTase through phenol extraction, the GpppAm-RNA was further incubated with E34A or E218 in the N7 buffer for the indicated time. The reaction mixtures were then analyzed on a denaturing gel. The methylation reactions using E34A, R84A, E218A, or WT MTase alone were also shown. The methylation reactions for the WT (lane 2) and R84A (lane 4) alone were performed in the 2-Obuffer; the methylation reactions for the E34A (lane 3) and E218A (lane 11) alone were performed in the N7 buffer.

pathway of cap methylations: GpppA-RNA  GpppAm-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA. To determine whether the 2-O methylated substrate GpppAm-RNA can be further methylated at the guanine N7 position, we prepared GpppAm-RNA by incubating GpppA-RNA with the mutant R84A (competent in 2-O methylation) for 30 min, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation to remove the R84A MTase. The resulting GpppAm-RNA (Fig. 3C, lane 4) was then incubated with E34A or E218A (competent in N7 methylation) for 5, 30, or 60 min (lanes 5­10). Analysis of the reactions on a denaturing gel

showed that the GpppAm-RNA can be converted to the doublemethylated m7GpppAm-RNA. As controls, E34A (lane 3) and E218A (lane 11) alone could only convert GpppA-RNA  m7GpppARNA, whereas R84A (lane 4) alone could only catalyze GpppARNA  GpppAm-RNA. These results demonstrate that the two methylations can be sequentially executed by separate MTase molecules. The results also indicate that an alternative ordering of cap methylations, GpppA-RNA  GpppAm-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA, can occur, at least in vitro.

Fig. 4. Comparison of N7 methylation efficiencies between substrates GpppA-RNA and GpppAm-RNA. (A) Substrates GpppA-RNA and GpppAm-RNA were incubated with WT MTase (top panel) or E34A MTase (bottom panel) in the N7 buffer for the indicated time, and digested with nuclease P1 and CIP. The products were separated on a high percentage denaturing gel. The positions of GpppA, m7GpppA, GpppAm, and m7GpppAm are indicated on the left side of the gel. (B) The efficiencies of the N7 methylation reactions in (A) are summarized by the percentages of conversions of GpppA-RNA  m7GpppA-RNA and GpppAm-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA over the time course. The percentage of substrateto-product conversion was quantified using PhosphorImager.

Prior 2-O methylation of an RNA substrate does not affect the efficiency of N7 methylation The above results demonstrated that both the unmethylated GpppARNA and the 2-O methylated GpppAm-RNA are active substrates for N7 methylation. To test whether the presence of the 2-O methyl group affects the efficiency of N7 methylation, we compared the rates of N7 methylation between substrates GpppA-RNA and GpppAm-RNA. The GpppAm-RNA was prepared by incubation of GpppA-RNA with R84A mutant in the presence of SAM in a pH 9 buffer for 1 h. A time-course analysis using WT MTase showed that substrates GpppA-RNA and GpppAm-RNA were equally active in N7 methylation (Fig. 4A, top panel). Similar results were obtained when either of the N7-competent but 2-O-defective mutants E34A (Fig. 4A, bottom panel) or E218A was used (data not shown). The summary of these experiments (Fig. 4B) suggests that a prior 2-O methylation does not significantly affect the efficiency of the N7 methylation. Discussion In this study, we compared the methylation efficiencies of distinct mutant MTases of WNV (Fig. 1) on RNA substrates having various cap

methylation statuses, i.e., GpppA-RNA, m7GpppA-RNA, and GpppAmRNA. For N7 methylation, the presence of a 2-O methyl group in the cap structure does not affect the N7 methylation efficiency (Fig. 4). In contrast, for 2-O methylation, the N7-mutant MTases catalyze the m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA reaction more efficiently than they do the GpppA-RNA  GpppAm-RNA reaction (Fig. 2). The N7-independent 2-O methylation was also previously reported in DENV-2 MTase when a short nonviral RNA [GpppA(C)5] was used as a substrate (Egloff et al., 2002). These results demonstrate that the two methylation events are not absolutely dependent on one another. The results also suggest two alternative methylation pathways in vitro: GpppA-RNA  m 7 GpppA-RNA  m 7 GpppAm-RNA and GpppARNA  GpppAm-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA. Since the N7 methylation has no preference between substrates GpppA-RNA and GpppAm-RNA, the substrate preference of 2-O methylation for m7GpppA-RNA could be the factor that determines the dominant pathway of WNV cap methylation as GpppA-RNA  m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA. The current results are in agreement with our previous observation that N7 methylation precedes 2-O methylation (Ray et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007). The new finding that 2-O methylation prefers a substrate with prior N7 methylation provides an explanation for why the two methylation events are sequential. Our results showed that high percentage denaturing gel is a reliable method for separation of four types of cap structures (GpppA, m7GpppA, GpppAm, and m7GpppAm). All four cap molecules could be clearly separated from each other on the high percentage gel. The resolution of the high percentage gel is higher than that of TLC analysis. We previously used TLC to analyze the cap structures, and could not consistently detect GpppAm molecule. As discussed above, due to the dominant methylation pathway of GpppA-RNA  m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA, the amount of GpppAm is much less than those of GpppA, m7GpppA, and m7GpppAm. The weak signal of GpppAm on TLC plate could be masked by the strong signals from the other three cap structures, leading to difficulty in detection of the GpppAm molecule on the TLC plate. Two scenarios can be envisioned for the repositioning of the WNV RNA substrate on the enzyme surface from one methylation event to the next. The substrate could translocate on a single enzyme molecule; alternatively, the substrate could dissociate from one enzyme molecule after the first methylation, and reassociate with another enzyme molecule for the second methylation. The current study demonstrates that the two methylations can be independently accomplished by two individual N7 or 2-O mutant MTases; in contrast, two mutants with the same type of methylation defect could not complement to restore the defective methylation (Fig. 3). The successful trans complementation of two distinct MTase mutants is in favor of the model that the two methylations of the WNV RNA cap may be executed by separate methyltransferase molecules, through an RNA-enzyme dissociation-and-reassociation process. This process shows similarity to the processes of reovirus and bluetongue virus RNA cap formation, in which the N7 and 2-O methylations are sequentially catalyzed by two separate MTase domains within a large polyprotein (Reinisch, Nibert, and Harrison, 2000; Sutton et al., 2007). Although our results clearly showed that the two distinct mutants can separately catalyze the N7 and 2-O methylations, we could not completely exclude the possibility that WT MTase uses a single molecule to catalyze both reactions. Methylations of the cap structure at both positions with a single MTase molecule is supposed to be more efficient than that with two MTase molecules, because there is no need to dissociate the capped RNA substrate from the enzyme until the fully methylated cap structure is produced. A biophysical approach [such as FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)] is needed to clearly differentiate between the single and double MTase-based translocation models.

The enzyme-based trans complementation does not seem to agree with the replicon-based trans complementation. We previously showed that WNV replicons containing mutations in MTase could not be rescued by a WT Neo-replicon in BHK-21 cells (Ray et al., 2006). If two separate MTase molecules are used for different methylations via the dissociation-and-reassociation process, then WT NS5 from the helper Neo-replicon should be able to complement for the defective NS5 from the mutant replicon. It is currently not known what causes the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results. Apparently, recombinant MTase molecules in solution are readily available for association and disassociation with RNA substrate, making it accessible for complementation in vitro. In contrast, defective NS5 (with single-amino acid mutation) derived from the mutant replicon is associated with other viral and host proteins on the ER membrane (as replication complexes), and may not be available for substitution with WT NS5 from the helper replicon. Khromykh and colleagues previously showed that mutant NS5 with a C-terminal deletion up to 589 amino acids (aa 317­905) could be successfully complemented with helper replicon in Kunjin virus, whereas mutant NS5 within the N-terminal region (aa 1­316, spanning the MTase domain) could not be efficiently trans complemented in vivo (Liu et al., 2002). These results suggest that RNA replication of Kunjin virus requires the MTase-coding RNA and/or the MTase expression in cis. It should be noted that the lack of trans complementation in vivo does not devaluate the in vitro complementation results. We currently do not know how many copies of NS5 are present in one replication complex. It is not unreasonable to speculate that more than one copy of NS5 is included in the replication complex to perform distinct cap methylations. The requirement of cis expression of MTase, as demonstrated in Kunjin virus (Liu et al., 2002), could prohibit successful trans complementation in vivo. Materials and methods Mutant MTases of WNV Recombinant MTases were expressed using a pET28(a) vector containing the WNV MTase domain, representing the N-terminal 300 amino acids of NS5. All MTases contained an N-terminal (His)6-tag, and were expressed and purified through a Ni-NTA column. The protein (N90% purity) was quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and verified by SDS-PAGE. The preparation of WT and E218A MTases was described in (Ray et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007); and the preparation of E34A, R84A, and E149A MTases was detailed in (Dong et al., 2008). Methylation assays The 5-end labeled substrates, m7GpppA-RNA and GpppA-RNA (representing the first 190 nucleotides of the WNV genome) were prepared by incubating pppA-RNA, [-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and vaccinia virus capping enzyme (Epicentre) in the presence and absence of SAM, respectively. The capping reactions were performed following the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled RNAs were purified through two Sephadex G-25 spin columns (GE Healthcare), extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. The resulting m7GpppA-RNA and GpppA-RNA were resuspended in RNase-free water for methylation reactions. Three types of methylation assays were performed for WNV MTase. (i) A standard N7 methylation (GpppA-RNA  m7GpppARNA) was performed in a 20-l reaction containing about 3 pmol GpppA-RNA, 80 M SAM, 1 g MTase in N7 buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT); the reaction was incubated at 22°C for 5 min. (ii) A 2-O methylation (m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppA-RNAm or GpppA-RNA  GpppAm-RNA) was performed in a 20-l reaction containing 3 pmol RNA substrate, 80 M SAM, 1 g

MTase in 2-O buffer (50 mM glycine, pH 9, and 2 mM DTT); the reaction was incubated at 22°C for 1 h. (iii) A double-methylation (GpppA-RNA  m7GpppA-RNA  m7GpppA-RNAm or GpppARNA  GpppAm-RNA  m7GpppAm-RNA) reaction was performed in the 2-O buffer at 22°C for indicated time period. All methylation reactions were then treated with 1 U nuclease P1 at 37°C for 5 h, followed by 5 U of intestinal alkaline phosphatase at 37°C for 2 h. As controls, cap methylation with vaccinia virus VP39 protein was also performed in a 20-l reaction containing 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM DTT, 10 M SAM, about 3 pmol m7GpppA-RNA or GpppA-RNA, and 0.5 g recombinant VP39; the reaction was incubated at 30°C for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel (20 × 45 cm2) with 8 M urea. The bands representing different cap structures (GpppA, m7GpppA, GpppAm, and m7GpppAm) were quantified using a PhosphorImager. All experiments were performed for as least three times.
