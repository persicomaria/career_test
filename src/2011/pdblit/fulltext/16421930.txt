ABSTRACT Resolution of the crystal structure of the banana fruit endo- -1,3-glucanase by synchrotron X-ray diffraction at 1.45-Å resolution revealed that the enzyme possesses the eightfold / architecture typical for family 17 glycoside hydrolases. The electronegatively charged catalytic central cleft harbors the two glutamate residues (Glu94 and Glu236) acting as hydrogen donor and nucleophile residue, respectively. Modeling using a -1,3 linked glucan trisaccharide as a substrate confirmed that the enzyme readily accommodates a -1,3-glycosidic linkage in the slightly curved catalytic groove between the glucose units in positions 2 and 1 because of the particular orientation of residue Tyr33 delimiting subsite 2. The location of Phe177 in the proximity of subsite 1 suggested that the banana glucanase might also cleave -1,6-branched glucans. Enzymatic assays using pustulan as a substrate demonstrated that the banana glucanase can also cleave -1,6-glucans as was predicted from docking experiments. Similar to many other plant endo- -1,3glucanases, the banana glucanase exhibits allergenic properties because of the occurrence of wellconserved IgE-binding epitopes on the surface of the enzyme. These epitopes might trigger some crossreactions toward IgE antibodies and thus account for the IgE-binding cross-reactivity frequently reported in patients with the latex-fruit syndrome.

Key words: ( / )8 TIM-barrel structure; catalytic groove; -glucan; IgE-binding epitopes; allergen INTRODUCTION Adverse reactions to food known as food allergy affect a still-increasing number of individuals and are estimated to cause anaphylactic episodes in 6 ­ 8% of children and 2­3% of adults in western countries.1 Besides the classical allergies to fishes, crustaceans, milk, eggs, or peanut, allergic responses associated with the consumption of fresh fruits and, especially, banana, avocado, kiwi, peach, or tomato, contribute to the so-called latex-fruit syndrome.2 In almost 50% of individuals allergic to natural rubber latex (NRL), these freshly consumed fruits trigger more or less severe hypersensitivity responses. As a prevail©

ing hypothesis for such an allergen cross-reactivity, the cell-attached IgE antibodies are believed to recognize structurally similar epitopes occurring on either distinct proteins or, most probably, on closely related proteins found in both rubber latex and fresh fruits.3,4 Many of the plant proteins incriminated as potential food allergens are related to different families of pathogenesis-related proteins or PR-proteins,5 a set of different proteins synthesized by plants in response to various biotic and abiotic stress factors.6 For example, the major allergens responsible for the allergy to NRL have been identified as proteins belonging to families PR-4 (hevein and class-I chitinases containing an N-terminal chitin-binding domain),7,8 PR-2 ( -1,3-glucanases),7,9 and PR-14 (lipid transfer proteins or LTP).10 Besides in rubber latex, proteins related to different types of PR-proteins were identified in various fruits. Bananas are of particular concern because this worldwide consumed fruit accumulates large amounts of a mixture of potential allergens11 including a jacalinrelated lectin,12 a thaumatin-like PR-5 protein,13 a PR-2 endo- -1,3-glucanase,14 and a PR-8 class-III chitinase.15 In an effort to make an inventory of the major potential allergens in banana and to achieve the molecular characterization of their T-cell and IgE-binding epitopes, the structure of the endo- -1,3-glucanase from the pulp of the

ripe fruit was solved at 1.45-Å resolution. According to the CAZY databank (http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY) this enzyme, which specifically cleaves internal -1,3-linkages in -glucan,14 has been classified into the family GH17 of the glycoside hydrolases. Within the GH17 family, detailed structural studies are confined to the uncomplexed forms of two -glucanases with distinct substrate specificities from barley.16,17 Structural analyses of enzyme/substrate complex have not been reported yet for GH17 glycoside hydrolases but were performed for several members of the related GH16 -glucanase family.18 ­21 By combining the results of our high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the banana endo- -1,3-glucanase and these of the related GH16 glycoside hydrolases, a detailed analysis could be made of the determinants of the substrate specificity. The superimposition of our structure with the structures of enzyme/substrate complexes enabled us to map the binding subsites within the catalytic groove and to model a -1,3-linked glucose chain into the active site. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Purification The endo- -1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6) was isolated and purified from the pulp of ripe banana (Musa acuminata) fruits as previously described.12 -1,6-Glucanase Assay -1,6-Glucanase activity was assayed as described in De la Cruz and Llobell.22 Briefly, 0.2 mL of 1 mg mL 1 Ban-Gluc in 50 mM potassium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) was added to 0.8 mL of a solution of 5 mg mL 1 -1,6-glucan pustulan (Calbiochem) in the same buffer and incubated at 37°C for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively. The reaction was stopped by boiling 0.2 mL of the reaction mixture for 5 min. The glucose content was determined colorimetrically at 540 nm using the glucose oxidase/peroxidase/O-dianisidine assay kit (Sigma). Crystallization and Data Collection Prism formed crystals of recombinant Ban-Gluc were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C. Drops were equilibrated against 500- L reservoirs containing 2 M sodium formate and 0.1 M sodium acetate at pH 4.6. Crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and the solvent content is 40% for one molecule in the asymmetric unit. They were cryoprotected with a 3 M sodium acetate solution and flash-frozen in a nitrogen cold stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystem) before the data collection at the ESRF, Grenoble, beamline ID14-EH2. A complete data set was collected at 1.4-Å resolution on a MarCCD detector using synchrotron radiation with a wavelength, 0.933 Å. The data were processed with DENZO and reduced with SCALA.23 Overall statistics of the data collection are given in Table I. Structure Determination and Refinement The structure of native Ban-Gluc was solved by molecular replacement, using the structure of the -1,3-glucanase

from barley,16 as a search model (PDB code 1GHS). This protein shares 54.3% identity with Ban-Gluc. The program AMoRe24 returned a solution corresponding to one molecule in the asymmetric unit with a correlation factor of 50.8% and an Rfactor of 41.4% at 4.0-Å resolution. The crystallographic refinement was performed with the program REFMAC.25 Five percent of randomly distributed reflections were set apart for the calculation of Rfree values. Model rebuilding between two refinement steps was made in the calculated electron density maps 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc using the program TURBOFRODO.26 Residues 20, 24, 41, 61, 67, 118, 138, 164, 263, and 288 were refined with alternate conformations. The final structure of the native enzyme has been refined to an Rfactor of 15.7% and an Rfree factor of 17.9%. Model quality and stereochemistry was checked using PROCHECK.27 The refined crystal structure of Ban-Gluc was superimposed on the crystal structures of other glycosidases hydrolyzing the same or a similar substrate and/or having the same catalytic mechanism. For enzymes belonging to the same GH-A clan, the superimposition was guided by the identical relative position of the catalytic residues. Superimposition on the -1,3-glucanase (1GHS; 54% identity) and -1,3-1,4-glucanase (1AQ0; 52% identity) from barley yielded an RMSD of 0.527 and 0.534 for 253 and 241 residues, respectively. Superimposition on Cel5A from Bacillus agaradhaerens (4A3H, 9% identity) yielded an RMSD of 2.549 for 258 residues. For enzymes with a related substrate specificity but a different fold (i.e., GH16

BANANA ENDO- -1,3-GLUCANASE

237

family enzymes), the superimposition was guided by the 1 binding subsite and the catalytic nucleophile. The figures were prepared using Molscript,28 Bobscript,29 and Raster3D.30 The TOPS cartoon generation server (http://www.tops.leeds.ac.uk)31 was used and topology diagrams were modified using Adobe IllustratorTM. The program ESPript32 was used to compare the amino acid sequence of Ban-Gluc and other plant -1,3-glucanases. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments were based on Clustal X.33 The HCA (Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis)34 was performed to delineate the structurally conserved secondary structural features (strands of -sheet and short stretches of -helix) along the amino acid sequence of the Hevea endo- -1,3-glucanase by comparison with Ban-Gluc used as a model. HCA plots were generated with the HCA server (http://www.lmcp.jussieu.fr). Molecular surface and electrostatic potentials were calculated and displayed with GRASP using the parse3 parameters.35 The solvent probe radius used for molecular surfaces was 1.4 Å and a standard 2.0-Å Stern layer was used to exclude ions from the molecular surface.36 The inner and outer dielectric constants applied to the protein and the solvent were fixed at 4.0 and 80.0, respectively, and the calculations were performed keeping a salt concentration of 0.145 M. Epitopes susceptible to interact with T-cells were predicted throughout the amino acid sequences of Ban-Gluc and other endo- -1,3-glucanases by the MHC Class-II Binding Peptide Prediction Server ProPred) (http:// www.imtech.res.in/raghava/propred/index.html).37 According to their frequency with respect to the checked HLA alleles, they were considered as major or minor T-epitopes. The fraction of the surface occupied by T-cell epitopes on the molecular surface of Ban-Gluc was calculated and displayed using GRASP.35 Sequential IgE-binding epitopes were predicted from the hydropathic profiles as being the most hydrophilic, flexible, and surface-exposed regions. Different scales of hydrophilicity,38 flexibility,39 exposition to the solvent,40 and antigenicity,41 were used to build the hydropathic profiles with the MacVector (Kodak) software. The surface occupied by the previously predicted sequential T-cell and IgE-binding epitopes along the amino acid sequence was calculated and displayed on the molecular surface of the protein with GRASP.35 The overall conformation of the sequential IgE-binding epitopes on the molecular surface was displayed with PyMOL of W.L. DeLano (http:// www.pymol.org). RESULTS The three-dimensional structure of Ban-Gluc exhibits the typical ( / )8 TIM-barrel motif found in other glucan endohydrolases. It consists of an internal crown of eight -strands connected by more or less extended loops to an outer crown of eight -helices. An additional C-terminal loop containing a -sheet formed by two short antiparallel strands protrudes from the external crown of -helices [Fig. 1(A)].

Structure of the Active Site According to the classification of glycoside hydrolases, Ban-Gluc belongs to family 17.42 Ban-Gluc also belongs to the superfamily of proteins with eightfold / architecture43 and to clan GH-A which encompasses, among others, families 1, 5, 17, etc. Similar to all clan GH-A enzymes, the active site of family 17 glycoside hydrolases consists of two glutamates that act respectively as proton donor and nucleophile residues, respectively, to cleave -linked substrates at equatorial bonds yielding products that retain the -anomeric configuration. According to Jenkins et al.43 and Henrissat et al.,44 the proton donor is located just behind the C-terminal end of strand 4 whereas the nucleophile residue is located on a bulge in strand 7. These glutamate residues are strictly conserved in clan GH-A45 and correspond to E94 (proton donor residue) and E236 (nucleophile residue position anti) in Ban-Gluc [Fig. 1(B)]. They have been experimentally identified as such in two barley glucanases.43 These two catalytic glutamates are situated in the center of an extended groove, running across the enzyme surface. The relative position of the catalytic residues within the groove combined with a structural comparison to a clan GH-A cellulase46 cocrystallized with a substrate molecule allowed mapping of the substrate subbinding sites [Fig. 1(B)] according to the nomenclature defined by Henrissat and Davies.42 This central groove, approximately 35 Å long, lies between -helices 2 and 3b at the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain and between -helices 5 and 6 at the C-terminus of the chain. Interestingly, it is filled with numerous water molecules in the crystal structure, possibly replacing the hydroxyl side-groups of the substrate polysaccharide. Similar to barley endo- -1,3-1,4-glucanase and endo- -1,3-glucanase,16 one side (corresponding to -helices 2 and 6) of the catalytic groove consists of apolar residues whereas the other side (corresponding to -helices 3b and 5) predominantly contains polar residues. Moreover, the center of the groove exhibits a pronounced electronegative character because of the presence of residues E94, E236, E282, and E294 [Fig. 1(C)]. The groove is covered with aromatic residues over its total length (Y33, F177, F281, and F297), which allow the stacking of sugar rings. Whereas the groove is relatively narrow ( 10 Å) with a pronounced curvature on the side accommodating the nonreducing end of the sugar chain, it becomes more extended ( 18 Å) at the aglycone side. Such an enlargement of the binding site is compatible with substrates containing -1,3-linked glucose residues behind the point of cleavage ( 2 subsite). Moreover, the widening of the site suggested that also glucose chains containing -1,6 branching points at the 1 subbinding site might be potential substrates. To test the possible -1,6-glucanase activity, the banana enzyme was challenged with pustulan, a -1,6-linked glucose polymer isolated from the lichen Umbilicaria papulosa. A weak but definitely reproducible release of glucose was measured (Fig. 2) confirming that Ban-Gluc possesses besides -1,3glucanase activity also a -1,6-glucanase activity.

Comparison with other glycoside hydrolases from the same clan can yield additional information about the determinants of the substrate specificity of the enzymes. Therefore, we have superimposed the structure of BanGluc on the homologous structures of barley -1,6-1,3glucanase (1GHS) and barley -1,3-1,4-glucanase (1AQ0) from family 17, and on cellulase Cel5A from B. agaradherans (family 5) (4A3H). In contrast to Ban-Gluc, the groove in cellulase Cel5A is rather straight, which is consistent with its linear substrate made of -1,4-linked glucose. The curvature of the groove of barley -1,3-1,4-glucanase (1AQ0) is more pronounced than that of Cel5A but still weaker than that of Ban-Gluc. In the region of the active site that accommodates the nonreducing end of the substrate, residue D34 (F34 in -1,6-1,3-glucanase) creates a steric hindrance for substrates formed by alternate -1,31,4-linkages. This was already observed by Varghese et al.16 when comparing two barley -glucanases: the -1,3glucanase has a residue with a large side-chain at the position equivalent to the much smaller A34 of the -1,31,4-glucanase. On the aglycone side, -1,3-glucanase and -1,6-1,3-glucanase contain a short, polar residue (S139 in Ban-Gluc and S136 in barley -1,6-1,3-glucanase) that is replaced by the much larger F135 in barley -1,3-1,4glucanase. The lack of this bulky side-chain leaves sufficient space for a glucan residue linked through a -1,3 bond to the preceding glucosyl group at subsite 1. In contrast, I214 (M209 in barley -1,6-1,3-glucanase) forms a barrier for a -1,4 linked glucose residue while the replacement by the short and polar T210 in barley -1,3-1,4glucanase provides the space necessary to accommodate mixed linked glucose chains. These specific residue substitutions in the binding subsites, close to the site of cleavage, likely account for the substrate specificity of the three different enzymes from the GH17 family. Topology of the Epitopes Six major T-epitope amino acid sequence stretches (1: 18VVSLYKSNNIARMRLYDPNQA38; 4: 72WIRRNVVAYWPSVSFRYIAVGNE94; 5: 109MRNIYNALS117; 7: 170LVNVYPYFS178; 8: 198VVVQDGRFS206; 9: 297FGLFYPNKQ305) were predicted along the

polypeptide chain of Ban-Gluc [Fig. 1(D)]. Three other T-epitopes (2: 43LRNSNIQVL51; 3: 59VQSLASNPS67; 6: 158IVQFLASNGA167) directed toward a more limited number of HCA alleles were also identified on the molecular surface of Ban-Gluc. All these epitopes correspond to -helical (stretches 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), -stranded (stretches 1, 2, 4, 7, 8), or coiled (stretches 1, 2, 4, 7, 9) structures that are all rather well exposed on both faces of the molecule. Because of the high content of R and K residues, most of these putative epitopes (stretches 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9) coincide with the main electropositively charged areas on the surface of the molecule (result not shown). Some of these predicted T-epitopes (e.g., stretches 1, 4, and 6) occur at similar positions in other -1,3-glucanases such as those from elderberry (Sambucus nigra) fruits (unpublished results), peach (Prunus persica),47 and grape (Vitis vinifera).48 More interestingly, T-epitopes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 predicted along the Ban-Gluc polypeptide coincide with the main epitopic regions predicted on Hev b 2, the -1,3glucanase from Hevea latex. These T-cell epitopes are similarly positioned at the molecular surface of the protein as shown on a three-dimensional model of Hev b 2 built by homology modeling from the X-ray coordinates of Ban-Gluc (result not shown). Fifteen linear IgE-binding epitopic regions were predicted along the amino acid sequence of Ban-Gluc according to their hydrophilicity, flexibility, and exposition to the solvent (1: 11NLPPP15; 2: 23KSNN26; 3: 33YDPN36; 4: 44RNS46; 5: 64SNPSAA69; 6: 98GDS100; 7: 140YPPSAG145; 8: 165NGA167; 9: 179YTGNPG184; 10: 202RFSYQ207; 11: 236SGWPSAGGG244; 12: 250SN(A)QTYNQN258; 13: 265TPRRPGKEI275; 14: 285ENQKAGGI292; and 15: 301PNKQP305). Some of these regions correspond to surface-exposed loops but a few epitopes coincide with -helical regions protruding from the molecular surface of Ban-Gluc [Fig. 1(E)]. Except for epitopes 3, 4, and 8, all other epitopic regions were predicted at similar positions in Hev b 2 (Fig. 3). These IgE-binding epitopes are similarly positioned at the molecular surface of the protein as shown on a threedimensional model of Hev b 2 built by homology modeling from the X-ray coordinates of Ban-Gluc (result not shown). Epitopes 7 and 11, which are strictly conserved in both glucanases, exhibited a similar three-dimensional conformation (result not shown) and hence are suspected to be recognized by the same IgE antibodies. DISCUSSION Being a genuine endo- -1,3-glucanase with a canonical ( / )8 TIM-barrel motif, Ban-Gluc exhibits an electronegative catalytic groove that runs across the surface of the molecule [Fig. 1(C)]. Two of the four glutamate residues E94, E236, E282, and E294 that occupy the center of the groove account for the previously reported endo- -1,3glucanase activity of Ban-Gluc14: namely, E94 being the nucleophile, and E236 the proton donor.

plexes in the clan GH-A families together with the location of conserved residues in the active site enabled us to identify putative substrate binding subsites 2 to 1, using the standard subsite nomenclature. For this sake, a cellotriose-containing complex of Cel5A (clan GH-A family 5 cellulase; PDB code 4A3H) was in a first step superimposed on Ban-Gluc based on the relative position of the catalytic machinery (syn/anti), which is conserved within a clan of glycoside hydrolases. The sugar ring of this complex in subsite 2 was used as a starting template to model the substrate of Ban-Gluc. In a next step, the sugar ring in subsite 1 of a substrate molecule crystallized in an agarase from Zobellia galactanivorans (AgaA; family GH16 and clan GH-B, PDB code 1URX) was superimposed on that of Cel5A (keeping the respective nucleophile in all three enzymes in the same position) in order to determine the relative position of -1,3-linked glucan units in subsite 1 with respect to that of -1,4 linked cellobiose. In a last step, the sugar units of a laminarihexaose molecule, crystallized in complex with a laminarin-binding module (kindly provided by A. Boraston, before publication; PDB code 1W9W), was superimposed to the 2 and 1 binding subsites, to deduce the potential position of the glucose unit in the 1 binding subsite. The glucosyl residues of these three complexes, superimposed onto the threedimensional structure of Ban-Gluc were used as a basis for the modeling of an undistorted substrate molecule (three -1,3-linked glucan units in subsites 2, 1, and 1) in the catalytic groove of Ban-Gluc. It is commonly assumed that the 1 sugar unit undergoes ring distortion before the nucleophilic attack.49,50 However, we preferred not to take this presumed ring distortion into account when modeling the substrate in the groove of Ban-Gluc, because no experimental evidence has been reported yet for such ring distortion for GH17 glycosidases. Nevertheless, following this approach, a working hypothesis could be elaborated for what concerns the residues involved in hydrolysis and substrate binding, and the residues that determine the substrate specificity. Besides the two catalytic residues, two other strictly conserved residues in GH17 glycosidases

(namely, E294 and N93) seem to be involved in hydrogen bond formation with the hydroxyl groups of the glucose unit at subsite 1. In particular, Glu294 (corresponding to E288 in 1GHS and 1AQ0), interacts with O4 (2.21 Å) and O6 (2.55 Å) of the glucose unit in subsite 1. In addition, N93, which is a part of the acid/base signature sequence NEP(V), likely forms a hydrogen bond to O2 (2.7 Å) of the glucose unit in 1 and is also present in other clan GH-A enzymes. Furthermore, F281 and F297 create an aromatic pocket around subsite 1 so that the sugar ring is tightly positioned to allow the nucleophile attack, whereas Y174 might fix the sugar ring with a hydrogen bond to O5. The binding subsite 2 is delimited by Y33, oriented in such a way that the glucose unit in subsite 2 can be stacked onto the aromatic ring, and K289, potentially forming hydrogen bonds to O5 (3.05 Å) and O6 (2.35 Å) of the glucose unit in this subsite. The relative position of Y33 implies that the glycosidic bond between subsite 2 and subsite 1 should be a -1,3 linkage. Moreover, a -1,4-linkage between glucose units in subsites 1 and 2 would lead to a steric clash with E294 and K289. This is also true in both the -1,3-1,4-glucanase (1AQ0) and -1,3-glucanase (1GHS) from barley (in which the corresponding residues are E288 and K282, respectively). It can be concluded, therefore, that all three enzymes of the GH17 family compared here are specific for substrates having a -1,3-glycosidic linkage between the glucose units in positions 2 and 1. The location of F177 in the proximity of subsite 1, suggests that Ban-Gluc potentially cleaves branched substrates because this residue can stabilize a glucose unit linked to the preceeding through a -1,6 linkage. Therefore, this particular position of F117 is critical for the substrate specificity toward -1,3-1,6-linked glucans. It has been shown, indeed, that -1,3-glucanases are able to cleave -1,3-1,6-glucans commonly found in fungal cell walls, as reported for the -1,3-glucanase from barley.16 Interestingly, in the -1,3- -1,4 glucosidase from barley (1AQ0), F177 is replaced by L173 (whereas the same position is occupied by a phenylalanine in the -1,3

glucosidase from barley) (1GHS). This explains why -1,3glucanases can also hydrolyze -1,3-glucan containing -1,6 branches whereas -1,3-1,4 glucanases cannot. Ban-Gluc and Other Endo- -1,3-Glucanases Share Common B-Cell Epitopes IgE-binding epitopes are predicted to occur along the amino acid sequence of Ban-Gluc. Some of these epitopes recognized by IgE antibodies correspond to major epitopes suspected to induce allergic responses in sensitized individuals and thus explain why the occurrence of an endo- 1,3-glucanase in the pulp of ripe bananas can trigger allergic reactions to banana fruit. In addition, most of these IgE-binding epitopes are nicely exposed on the surface of Ban-Gluc and hence are suspected to participate in conformational epitopes recognizable by the IgEcovered mast cells of sensitized patients. Endo- -1,3-glucanases are ubiquitous enzymes belonging to the family of PR-2 proteins51 that are very common in pollens52­54 and food plants including numerous fruits.9,14 An endo- -1,3-glucanase referred to as Hev b 2 is also present in the rubber tree latex.55 These glycosyl hydrolases have been identified as potent allergens recognized by IgE from sera of atopic patients allergic to Hevea latex,56 olive pollen,53 or fruits such as banana or tomato.9 According to their very conserved ( / )8 TIM-barrel fold, these structurally related plant endo- -1,3-glucanases share common major and minor IgE-binding epitopes. This epitopic community is especially relevant because it offers a molecular basis to account for both the oral allergy syndrome (OAS) and the latex-fruit syndrome, even though the allergens of pollen, fruits, and latex use different ways to sensitize and trigger allergic responses in susceptible individuals. In this respect, most of the predicted IgEbinding epitopes of Ban-Gluc numbered 1­5 (see Fig. 3) are nicely conserved in the endo- -1,3-glucanases Hev b 2 (epitopes 1­5) of the rubber tree latex,55 Ole e 9 (epitopes 1, 3, 4, and 5) of the olive pollen,53 and in the endo- -1,3glucanase from tomato (epitopes 1, 3, and 4).57 In agreement with these predictions, both a polyclonal antiserum specific for the N-terminal domain of Ole e 9 and sera from individuals allergic to olive pollen, readily detected reactive peptide epitopes common to the endo- -1,3-glucanase in extracts from banana, tomato, potato, bell pepper, or latex.54 In previously sensitized individuals, the epitopic community observed between Ban-Gluc and Hev b 2 could trigger some cross reactions toward IgE antibodies and thus account for the IgE-binding cross-reactivity frequently reported in people with the latex-fruit syndrome. According to both the extremely high sequence and structure conservation and the widespread distribution of endo-1,3-glucanases in fruits, these hydrolytic enzymes might act as potent food allergens that are most probably responsible for many food allergies.54 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The financial support of CNRS is gratefully acknowledged (A.B., P.R.).
