Abstract Laminins are a family of multi-functional basement membrane proteins. Their C-terminal domain binds to cell surface receptors and is thereby responsible for cell anchorage and the initiation of specific outside-in and inside-out signals. With their N-terminal parts, laminins interact with proteins of the extracellular matrix scaffold to secure the basement membrane to the underlying mesenchymal tissue. Laminins 5A (a3Ab3g2), 5B (a3Bb3g2) and 6 (a3Ab1g1) are isoforms specific of the basement membrane underneath the epidermis and they undergo a sequential series of extracellular proteolytic changes, which might successively turn on and off one or several of their biological and mechanical functions. Under physiological conditions, such as in adult human skin, epithelial laminins have lost part of the C- and N-terminal domains of the a3 and g2 chains, respectively. In contrast, in cylindromatosis, a rare inherited disease characterised by major ultrastructural alterations of the basement membrane and altered expressionydistribution of integrin receptors, laminin processing has not been completed. Together, these results suggest that laminin processing may regulate signalling pathways and the architecture of the basement membrane by restricting the repertoire of interactions with cell surface receptors and extracellular matrix components. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.yInternational Society of Matrix Biology.

1. Introduction Laminins are a family of multi-functional extracellular molecules with a central role in the formation, organisation and physiology of basement membranes. On the one hand, they interact with cell surface receptors, thereby providing adjacent cells with anchorage and signals regulating differentiation, movement, survival and the expression of specific genes. On the other hand, they bind to extracellular matrix proteins to form organised scaffolds delimiting and connecting different tissues. These functions need to be adapted to the required mechanical and physiological properties of basement membranes at particular locations in the organism. This is in part achieved by the expression of developmentand tissue-specific isoforms of laminin and also probably by partial proteolysis. In this mini-review, we summarise the current knowledge on epithelial laminins, in particular laminin 5, which undergo a sequential series of extracellular proteolytic changes that might successively

turn on and off some of the biological and mechanical functions. 2. Structure of laminin 5 and its relatives Laminins are composed of three genetically different chains, a, b and g, with so far 12 different variants for which expression is spatio-temporally regulated, so that development- and tissue-specific laminin isoforms exist. Laminin 1 (a1b1g1) is the first variant appearing during embryogenesis, while in further developmental stages, basement membranes become more versatile in their repertoire of laminin isoforms. In particular, the basement membrane underneath epithelia with secretory or protective functions, such as in skin or mucosa, contains laminins 5A, 5B and 6 (Fig. 1), in addition to widely distributed laminins, such as laminin 10 (Champliaud et al., 1996; Aumailley and Rousselle, 1999; Garbe et al., 2002). The C-terminal portion of these laminins, hereafter referred as epithelial laminins, is structurally similar to that of other laminin isoforms known to date. In each chain, a ;600-residue stretch is responsible for folding into coil-coiled abg trimers stabilised by disulfide bonds

(Timpl, 1996). The a chains have an additional Cterminal extension formed by five separately folded domains, LG1­LG5. In contrast to the similarities in the organisation of the C-terminal end of laminins, greater variability is observed in the overall structure of the independently folded N-terminal regions. These are formed by three types of modules differing in number and location: LE (laminin EGF-like) motifs arranged in rod-like rows, and the globular domains L4 and LN, the latter being always N-terminal (for a review see Timpl and Brown, 1996; Aumailley and Smyth, 1998; Colognato and Yurchenco, 2000). Full-length a3B, b1 and g1 chains have a large number of LE motifs, L4 modules and one LN domain each (Fig. 1). By contrast, the a3A chain has three LE motifs only, the b3 chain has five LE motifs, no L4 module and a LN domain, and the g2 chain has six LE motifs, one L4 module and no LN domain. Based on the domain organisation of epithelial laminins, it is logical to predict similar roles for the Cterminal regions and divergent functions for the N-terminal portions. In addition, studies of laminin 5A extracted from tissues or synthesised by cultivated cells, or of recombinant fragments have indicated that a further degree of versatility is provided by proteolysis of specific domains (Fig. 2). Epithelial cells synthesise the a3A and a3B chains as polypeptides of ;180 and 325 kDa, respectively, which can be extracellularly processed into smaller forms (Marinkovich et al., 1992; Tsubota et al., 2000; Garbe et al., 2002). One enzymatic cleavage occurs within the identical C-terminus of the a3A and

a3B variants, leading to the removal of the LG4 and LG5 domains and conversion of the chains into 165and 280-kDa subunits, respectively. The a3A chain can be converted to an even smaller subunit of 145 kDa by processing of its N-terminus (Marinkovich et al., 1992; Amano et al., 2000). The g2 chain, produced as a

precursor polypeptide of 155 kDa, is also prone to processing of its N-terminal domains, leading to a 105kDa subunit. For both the a3A and g2 chains, Nterminal processing is complex and involves at least enzymatic cleavage within a disulfide-linked loop of a LE motif (LE2 for a3A and L4m for g2) and reshuffling of disulfide bonds for release of the cleaved fragments (Amano et al., 2000; Sasaki et al., 2001). A more extensive processing was reported for rat laminin g2 chain (Giannelli et al., 1997). 3. Interactions of epithelial laminins The epidermis is secured to the upper layer of the dermis by anchoring complexes connecting the intraepithelial network of keratin filaments to the deeper located mesenchymal connective tissue (Aumailley and Rousselle, 1999; Nievers et al., 1999). Molecular dissection of the anchoring complexes has identified several of the constituents specific to these structures (Fig. 3). They include the hemidesmosomal 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen and HD1yplectin as intracellular proteins, collagen XVII and the a6b4 integrin as transmembrane components, epithelial laminins in the anchoring filaments and collagen VII in the anchoring fibrils (Jones et al., 1998; Nievers et al., 1999). Their

indispensable role in the mechanical stability of the dermal­epidermal junction has been demonstrated by genetic studies showing that lack of any of them, caused by null mutations in the corresponding genes, leads to epidermolysis bullosa, inherited blistering diseases of the skin characterised by the formation of blisters and detachment of the epidermis from the dermis (Burgeson and Christiano, 1997). In vitro analysis of the interactions that epithelial laminins develop with specific components of the anchoring complexes, as well as with other, more ubiquitous transmembrane or extracellular proteins, has shed some light on the molecular linkages underlying the organisation of the dermal­epidermal junction. The a3b1 and a6b4 integrins interact with the C-terminal LG1-3 domains of laminin a3 chains (Carter et al., 1991; Rousselle and Aumailley, 1994) and syndecans bind to the LG4-5 domains (Utani et al., 2001). Based on studies with recombinant laminin fragments from other laminin a chains (Talts et al., 1998, 1999, 2000; Andac et al., 1999), we anticipate that the LG4-5 domains also have affinity for a-dystroglycan. The proteolytic cleavage occurring between the LG3 and LG4 modules in the laminin a3 chains could therefore remodel laminin function by restricting the repertoire of interactions with cellular receptors (Fig. 4). While the potential interactions between the C-terminal domains of epithelial laminins and cellular receptors are defined to a large extent, those involving the Nterminal parts are less well characterised and their biological relevance is still unclear. In other laminin chains, the most N-terminal LN module has been shown

to participate in laminin polymerisation, a process important for the formation of the basement membrane scaffold (Colognato and Yurchenco, 2000). The current model for laminin self-assembly into polymers applies to isoforms containing a set of three LN modules, which is not the case for epithelial laminins (Cheng et al., 1997). However, the LN modules of at least the a3B, b1 and g1 chains have the property to associate noncovalently with other LN modules (Garbe et al., 2002). In addition, the N-terminal regions of laminin 5A and laminin 6 are involved in the formation of a disulfidebonded dimer, and hence an entity with three LN modules (Champliaud et al., 1996). It is therefore possible that epithelial laminins participate in the formation of small, imperfect polymers. A further interaction taking place between the N-terminal region of laminin 5A and collagen VII (Chen et al., 1997; Rousselle et al., 1997) has been proposed to link the anchoring filaments to the anchoring fibrils (Fig. 3). Finally, several other extracellular proteins, including nidogen 1, fibulin 1 and fibulin 2, bind to recombinant forms of the g2 chain, in particular to its unique L4m domain (Utani et al., 1997; Sasaki et al., 2001). These proteins are known to function as extracellular matrix linkers (Fox et al., 1991; Aumailley et al., 1993; Sasaki et al., 1995) and could therefore serve to anchor epithelial laminins to the extracellular matrix scaffold. 4. Regulation of the interactions of epithelial laminins by processing In the basement membrane underlying the epidermis of adult human skin, the C-terminal LG4-5 domains of the laminin a3 chains and the N-terminal domains of the laminin g2 chain are absent (Tunggal et al., 2002). This indicates that C- and N-terminal processing of the a3 and g2 chains, respectively, has been fully completed under physiological conditions and that the cleaved domains do not participate in the stability of the dermal­ epidermal junction. By contrast, in cylindromatosis, a very rare inherited disease characterised by the occurrence of multiple benign epithelial tumours in the upper dermis, the processing of the a3 and g2 chains has not been completed, at least fully. The basement membrane surrounding the tumour epithelial cells is dramatically enlarged, with a massive accumulation of laminin 5, and it is ultrastructurally abnormal. In particular, there is no clear distinction of a lamina densa and most of the material appears as lamina lucida containing ectopically localised collagen VIl (Bruckner-Tuderman et al., 1991). Furthermore, hemidesmosomes are poorly organised and reduced in number and targeting of the a6b4 integrins to the basal surface of the tumour epithelial cells is decreased, while b1 integrins are up-regulated (Tunggal et al., 2002). Thus, major alterations are observed when epithelial laminins are not properly processed.

Potential interactions between the laminin LG4-5 domains and cell surface receptors are very likely to be transient and rapidly abolished by processing, since they are not observed in quiescent basal keratinocytes of adult human skin. In contrast, these interactions are maintained at the surface of cylindroma cells. At this point we do not know whether the persistent engagement of the LG4-5 domains with the cell surface sterically hinders the interaction of a6b4 integrins, but not b1, with the LG1-3 domains, or whether the simultaneous binding of LG1-3 and LG4-5 to cell surface receptors triggers an aberrant signalling (Fig. 4), resulting in dysregulated control of epithelial laminin synthesis and deposition. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating the expression of laminins and cognate receptors in general. In b1 integrin-deficient embryoid bodies, expression of the laminin b1 chain is down-regulated, dystroglycan is up-regulated and a basal lamina does not form (Aumailley et al., 2000; Li et al., 2002). Thus, in this case, ligand and receptor expression is interdependent. In the later stages of development when basement membrane turnover is probably low, uncoupling or abolition of part of the signalling could be achieved by proteolysis of the laminin G domains (Fig. 4). Secondary to regulated expression, laminins need to be integrated in the basement membrane scaffold. For epithelial laminins, cleavage of the N-terminal domain of the g2 chain has been shown to be necessary for the deposition of laminin 5 by cultivated keratinocytes (Gagnoux-Palacios et al., 2001). This cleavage is thought to permit the interaction with collagen VII (Rousselle et al., 1997), and lack of g2 chain processing might therefore be linked to the ectopic localisation of collagen VII fibrils in cylindromas. Alternatively, or in addition, the thickness of the basement membrane surrounding cylindromas might not allow, or at least reduce the cross-talk between fibroblasts and epithelial cells that is needed for the synthesis and assembly of basement components. Laminins 5A, 5B and 6 are produced by epithelial cells, nidogen and fibulin 1 are contributed by mesenchymal cells, and collagens IV, collagen VII ¨ and fibulin 2 are synthesised by both cell types (Konig and Bruckner-Tuderman, 1992; Pan et al., 1993; Thomas and Dziadek, 1993; Ekblom et al., 1994; Fleischmajer et al., 1998). The binding sites for nidogen and fibulins are present on the N-terminal domains of the laminin g2 chain, and it remains to be seen how they are affected by processing. In conclusion, the molecular mechanisms leading to the deposition and assembly of epithelial laminins and other basement membrane components at the dermal­ epidermal junction must be exquisitely regulated and synchronised. It may involve the remodelling of receptor­ligand and protein­protein interactions by proteolysis of specific subdomains. These issues are very complex and should now be addressed in integrated
