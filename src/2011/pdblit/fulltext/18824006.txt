Long-term carcinogen exposure exerts continuous pressure on key mechanisms that repair or eliminate carcinogen-damaged cells giving rise to selective failures that contribute to lung cancer. FOXO3a is a transcription factor that elicits a protective response to diverse cellular stresses. Although implicated as a tumor suppressor, its role in sporadic cancer is uncertain. We recently observed that FOXO3a gene inactivation occurs frequently in carcinogen-induced lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). This suggests that FOXO3a may play a role in LAC suppression by eliciting a protective response to carcinogenic stress. Here we investigated this possibility by examining the role of FOXO3a in the cellular response to nicotinederived nitrosaminoketone (NNK), a lung carcinogen implicated as a cause of human LAC. We show that restoration of FOXO3a in FOXO3a-deficient LAC cells increases sensitivity to apoptosis caused by a DNA-damaging intermediate of NNK. Prior to this cellular outcome, FOXO3a is functionally activated and mediates a large-scale transcription program in response to this damage involving a significant modulation of 440 genes. Genes most significantly represented in this program are those with roles in cell growth and proliferation > protein synthesis > gene expression > cell death > cell cycle. The results of this study show that FOXO3a directs an anti-carcinogenic transcription program that culminates in the elimination of carcinogen-damaged cells. This suggests that FOXO3a is a potential suppressor of carcinogenic damage in LAC. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death both in the U.S. and world-wide [1,2]. Eighty-seven percent of these cases are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), of which adenocarcinoma is the most common type [1,2]. Studies have shown that carcinogens in tobacco smoke are the underlying cause of 85% of all lung cancer cases [2]. More than 60 carcinogens are present in tobacco smoke, some of which are confirmed human lung carcinogens [2]. These include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (e.g. benzo[a]pyrene) and tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNA) (e.g. 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone or NNK) [2,3]. Furthermore, nicotine-derived nitrosaminoketone (NNK) has been implicated as a likely cause of human lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), which typically occurs in the peripheral pleura as a consequence of deep inhalation of filtered cigarette smoke [3]. NNK is metabolized to both methylating and pyridyloxobutylating agents that differentially attack DNA causing gene mutations [3]. We recently showed that this carcinogen also induces LAC in mice with extensive chromosome instability (CIN), which is most likely a downstream

effect of the relatively bulky pyridyloxobutylation DNA adducts of metabolically activated NNK [3,4]. A vast network of functions protect DNA from damage that can lead to cancer, which involve DNA damage sensing, and the elicitation and execution of the protective cellular responses to the damage, including DNA repair, and the elimination of severely damaged cells [5­8]. The Forkhead box type-O (FOXO) family of transcription factors protects cells from a number of cancer related stresses, including oxidative stress, hypoxia, and DNA damage [9­13]. Evidence suggests that FOXO3a regulates a cellular response to these stresses that includes growth arrest, apoptosis, as well as DNA repair depending on the cellular context and the nature of the stress [14­19]. Under growth factor stimulation Akt and I B kinases have been shown to inhibit FOXOs by direct phosphorylation causing their nuclear exclusion and inactivity [14,15,19]. Stress-activation apparently overrides this inhibitory control over FOXO function resulting in its localization to the nucleus where it is transcriptionally active. Although several phosphorylation sites of FOXOs have been characterized, the actual post-translational changes that confer stress-activation of FOXO3a have not been reported [14,15,20,21]. Germline inactivation of FOXO3a predisposes mice to pituitary and ovarian tumors, which has implicated it as a tumor suppressor gene [22]. We recently identified FOXO3a as a target of

selective bi-allelic deletion in human and mouse LAC in association with NNK exposure (Herzog, in preparation). As a stress-activated transcription factor, FOXO3a may play a role in suppressing lung carcinogenesis by inhibiting the tumorigenic effects of carcinogens. Here we investigated the cellular response elicited by FOXO3a in response to NNK-induced DNA damage as a potential mechanism of suppressing lung carcinogenesis. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Cell culture H23, H358, H441, H460, H838, A549, H1395, H522, H1650, H2126 and H1299 human NSCLC cell lines were purchased from the ATCC and maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum as recommended. All cell lines were derived from LAC with the exception of H460 (large cell carcinoma) and H1299, which was derived from a NSCLC of undetermined histotype. Transfections were carried out using lipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Conditions were optimized using 1 g of plasmid DNA in 35 mm2 dishes. For transfection, full-length FOXO3a cDNA was reversetranscribed using MMLV reverse transcriptase and PCR amplified using Hi-Fi Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplified FOXO3a cDNA was cloned into the pCR3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's recommendations. Wild-type clones used in functional experiments were confirmed by sequence analysis. The control vector lacked inserted cDNA. Following transfection cells were treated with 4(acetoxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNKOAc) (5­30 M) for 24 h, H2 O2 (50­300 M) for 1 h or DMSO (vehicle). Cells were then selected in G418 containing medium for 1 week after which MTS assays were carried out according to manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, St. Louis, MO). The surviving fraction relative to vehicle treated cells was determined for each treatment. 2.2. Quantitative PCR Gene deletion analysis of FOXO3a was carried out by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of genomic DNA isolated from each of the NSCLC cell lines shown above as follows: 95  C for 2 min followed by 22­25 cycles (i.e. within exponential phase) at 95  C, 55­60  C, and 72  C each for 30 s. PCR products were resolved in 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Deletions were determined by calculating target intensity/control intensity in the cell lines divided by that value obtained from normal DNA isolated from normal human lymphocytes WBC (IRB protocol No. 24072EP). GAPDH and ACTIN were used as controls. Several primer pairs were used in the deletion analysis of FOXO3a. These included (5 ­3 ) FOXO3a set 1: forward, AGGAGGACGATGAAGACGACGA; reverse, TGCTGTCGCCCTTATCCTTGAAGT; FOXO3a set 2: forward, TCTCGGATTCGTCGGAGTGCGCTT; reverse, TCCAGCAAATGTACTCCTGTCCGT 3 ; FOXO3a set 3: forward, AGATCTACGAGTGGATGGTGCGTT; reverse, AAGCGCACTCCGACGAATCCGAGA; FOXO3a set 4: forward, TGACTGATATGGCAGGCACCATGA; -ACTIN: forward, GCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAG; reverse, CTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTCAGG; GAPDH: forward, GTATTGGGCGCCTGGTCACC; reverse, CAGTGGACTCCACGACGTAC. Quantification was carried by densitometry using UVP Imaging and Analysis System and LabWorks software (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA). Gene dose was quantified as follows: FOXO3a gene intensity/control gene intensity of tumor DNA divided by that of normal (non-cancerous) tissue DNA. Reproducible absence of detectable FOXO3a PCR product relative to the presence of control was considered a homozygous or bi-allelic deletion, and a dose reduction of >40% was considered a hemizygous dele-

tion. Oligonucleotide primers used in this study were designed based on the available gene sequences from NCBI and Ensembl genome browsers and purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA. Oligos were designed to avoid known single nucleotide polymorphisms which may affect gene dose quantitation. For deletion scoring, 3 contiguous, non-overlapping PCR products within FOXO3a must have met the quantitative threshold of deletion. Western blot analysis of cell lines also was used to validate the quantitative PCR results. 2.3. Mutation analysis Examination of tumors and cell lines for mutations within the coding region of human and mouse FOXO3a (i.e. exons 2 and 3) was carried out by direct sequence analysis of PCR amplified fragments. Sequencing was performed by the Molecular Genetics Core Facility of the Penn State College of Medicine using the Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Sequencer and reagents purchased from the manufacturer. 2.4. FACS analysis Transfected cells were treated with 30 M NNKOAc or vehicle for 24 h then fixed with 70% ethanol for 15 min on ice. These cells were then stained with 5 g/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 250 g/ml RNase A. Cell cycle distribution was determined for each treatment of the analysis using a Beckman Coulter Elite flow cytometer/cell sorter and Mastercycler software (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FA). For apoptosis analysis, these cells were collected after 48 h of treatment with 30 M NNKOAc or vehicle. Apoptosis was determined using flow cytometric-TUNEL analysis. For this analysis, fragmented DNA was labeled with fluorescene-dUTP using the DeadEnd fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega, St. Louis, MO) following the manufacturers protocol. 2.5. Immunofluorescence H1299 NSCLC cells were plated onto chamber slides and synchronized in G1 phase of the cell cycle by treating with 1 mM hydroxyurea for 12 h. The cells were then treated with a 30 M NNKOAc. At several time points following treatment, cells were fixed in the chamber slides with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice. Cells were then washed and permeabilized with PBS/0.02% Triton X-100, and blocked with PBS/3% BSA. Primary FOXO3a (H-144) antibody was applied to the cells at a concentration of 50 g/ml and incubated overnight at 4  C. Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was applied following washing at a concentration of 10 g/ml and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst at a dilution of 1:10 for 1 h at room temperature. Images were acquired with a Leica confocal microscope (TCS SP2 AOBS, Leica Microsystems, Manheim, Germany), using a 488 nm laser for the Cy2, a 543 nm laser for the Cy3, and 633 laser for the Cy5 fluorophores. The fluorophores were imaged using a sequential line scan, with detection bands set at 420­475 nm for Hoechst and 554­640 nm for Cy3. Each image was saved at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixel image size. The optical sections were reconstructed by maximum projection with the Leica software. 2.6. Western blotting Typically 25­40 g of whole cell lysates were denatured in 1× Laemmeli sample buffer, electrophoresed, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h. Incubations with primary and secondary antibodies were either for 2 h or overnight at 4  C.

Fig. 1. Loss of FOXO3a in human NSCLC cell lines. (A) Quantitative PCR of FOXO3a using DNA isolated from the NSCLC cell lines shown. GAPDH is used as control sequence to quantify FOXO3a gene dose in each cell line relative to that of DNA obtained from normal human lymphocytes. (B) Western blot analysis of FOXO3a on the cell lines shown in (A). -ACTIN is used as a loading control for relative quantitation of FOXO3a protein in each cell line. NL20 is a human non-tumorigenic lung epithelial cell line used as a quantitative reference. Numerical values are the relative gene dose of FOXO3a in each cell line compared with that of normal control DNA in (A) and FOXO3a protein expression in (B), as described in Section 2.

Antibodies were diluted in 5% milk in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20. Anti-FOXO3a antibody (H-144) was used at a dilution of 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Anti- -actin antibody was used at a dilution of 1:3000 (Sigma­Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). 2.7. Expression microarray analysis These experiments used the CodeLink Bioarray system with arrays of the fully transcribed human genome (40,000 probes). The experimental protocol entailed transfection of H358 cells with FOXO3a (vs. empty vector control). After 24 h the cells were given fresh completed medium containing 30 M NNKOAc or vehicle (DMSO). After 6 h of exposure, cells were collected and processed for microarray expression analysis. Experimental triplicates were analyzed for each of the treatment groups. Sample preparation followed standard protocols and conditions. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD), and purified on Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cRNA synthesis was performed using 2 g of RNA according to manufacturer's instructions. This was followed by second strand synthesis and purification of dsDNA using Qiaquick (Qiagen) spin columns. T7 reaction buffer, T7 NTPs, 10 mM biotin-11-UTP, and T7 polymerase were then added to the purified dsDNA for cRNA synthesis and incubated at 37  C for 14 h. Biotin labeled cRNA was then purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen), fragmented, and denatured before hybridization for 18 h at 37  C. Alexa Fluor 647 labeled steptavidin was added to the slides followed by washing. Microarrays were scanned with an Axon 4000B scanner with GenePix4 v4.0 software at a 5 m resolution at 635 nm with laser power at 100%, PMT voltage at 600 V, focus position 0 m, and lines to average = 1. Images were imported into CodeLink Expression Analysis Software v4.1 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Initial quality control (positive and negative controls), exclusion of manufacturing defects (MSR spots), background subtraction, and intra-array normalization were performed and results exported to GeneSpring 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Arrays were normalized to the 50th percentile, and individual genes normalized to the median. Potential differential expression was determined with a one-way ANOVA (variances not assumed to be equal) and filtered for p < 0.05 differences in expression with a cutoff 1.4-fold change in expression. Principle component analysis (PCA) by group was performed using GeneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies). The union of all gene expression changes between groups (7772 genes) was used in the PCA calculation and the graph was mean-centered and scaled, as shown in Fig. 3D. For network generation, a dataset containing gene

identifiers and corresponding expression values was uploaded into the application for genes with significant changes in expression, as described above. Each identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. These genes were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Systems Knowledge Base. Networks of these genes were then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. The functional analysis of a network identified the biological functions and/or diseases that were most significant to the genes in the network. The network genes associated with biological functions and/or diseases in the Ingenuity Systems Knowledge Base were considered for the analysis. Fischer's exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that each biological function and/or disease assigned to that network is due to chance alone. 2.8. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR RNA isolated as described above for expression microarray analysis also was subjected to reverse transcription with MMLV reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed on the cDNA to validate expression microarray results using selected gene-specific primers. Oligonucleotide primers PCR reactions of 50­100 ng of high quality cDNA were carried out essentially as described above. Quantitation of relative target genes was also carried out by calculating target PCR intensity/control PCR intensity in the test or treated sample relative to that of the control or untreated sample. GAPDH and ACTIN were used as control genes for test gene expression quantitation. Quantification was carried by densitometry using UVP Imaging and Analysis System and LabWorks software (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA). Oligonucleotide primers used in this study were designed based on the available gene sequences from NCBI and Ensembl genome browsers and purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA. 3. Results Cancer cell genomes are typically unstable, which characteristically gives rise to the selective loss of genes with key roles in suppressing or inhibiting tumor development [23]. We recently identified FOXO3a as a novel target of deletion in human LAC of smokers (Herzog, in preparation). This was determined by demonstrating in several cases its homozygous or bi-allelic deletion with retention of its nearest flanking genetic neighbors. Here we

demonstrate further that FOXO3a is very frequently altered by gene deletion in NSCLC. Eight out of 10 of the NSCLC cell lines examined showed clear reductions in FOXO3a gene dose relative to that detected in DNA isolated from normal human tissue (Fig. 1A). Deletion analysis was performed by quantitative PCR, as described in Section 2.2. Of the cell lines examined, H1299 and H2126 displayed the greatest retention of FOXO3a. These results were corroborated by Western blot analysis of the same 10 cell lines (Fig. 1B). In each case FOXO3a protein levels were concordant with FOXO3a gene levels (Fig. 1B). Mutation analysis of the FOXO3a coding region also was performed to assess another common mechanism of gene inactivation in cancer. PCR products were generated of exons 2 and 3 from genomic DNA isolated from each cell line and normal tissue and subjected to direct sequence analysis. However, no intragenic mutations were detected in any of the cell lines, a finding previously determined for several of primary NSCLC (Herzog, in preparation). These data suggest that gene loss is a common mode of FOXO3a inactivation in NSCLC. Because FOXO3a is a stress-responsive transcription factor, this suggested that FOXO3a may play a role in suppressing carcinogenic damage as a mechanism of suppressing NSCLC. Using a known carcinogenic intermediate of NNK (NNKOAc) we next examined the FOXO3a-mediated response to a relevant lung carcinogenic stress. NNKOAc is a stabilized carcinogenic intermediate of NNK metabolism that damages DNA by pyridyloxobutylation [24]. LAC is commonly occurred in smokers who are chronically exposed to carcinogens. Whereas the effects of DNA-damaging carcinogens are most profound in tumor initiation their effects continue with exposure throughout tumor development. The role of FOXO3a in the

suppression of these effects may then be instrumental at any point in tumor development that is impacted by carcinogen exposure. Taking this into account, we examined the response of FOXO3a to NNK in cells that had lost FOXO3a function at some unknown point in LAC development. H358 LAC cells (p53-negative) were transfected with full-length wild-type FOXO3a cDNA in a mammalian expression vector (pCR3.1). H358 cells express very low levels of endogenous FOXO3a making them suitable for analysis of restored FOXO3a activity (Fig. 2). Transfection conditions were optimized as described in Section 2. After transfection with either cognate or empty (control) vector, cells were plated in fresh medium and treated with increasing concentrations of NNKOAc (up to 30 M) or H2 O2 . MTS assays were performed on these cells after 1 week of selection with G418 to determine the effect of NNKOAc and H2 O2 on the survival of cells expressing exogenous FOXO3a. FOXO3a expressing cells were found to have significantly increased sensitivity to NNKOAc compared with vector controls (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A) Similar results were obtained using increasing concentrations of H2 O2 , which has been shown to activate FOXO3a, and was used as a positive control for our study. FACS-TUNEL analysis was performed next to determine whether apoptosis accounted for the observed FOXO3a-mediated sensitivity to NNKOAc. Cells were again transfected and treated with a cytotoxic dose of NNKOAc (30 M). A significantly larger (p < 0.01) apoptotic fraction was observed for the FOXO3a transfected cells compared with the vector control transfected cells following 48 h of NNKOAc treatment (Fig. 2B). However, FAC analysis revealed no FOXO3a-dependent change in the cell cycle 24 h after treatment as a similar increase in the G2/M fraction was induced by NNKOAc in

Fig. 3. FOXO3a localizes to the nucleus during exposure to NNKOAc. Shown are representative immunofluorescent images of H1299 cells taken during exposure to 30 M NNKOAc or vehicle for the times indicated. Immunofluorescence is performed as described in Section 2.

both FOXO3a and vector control transfected cells (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained in experiments using A549 LAC cells (p53positive), which also express very low levels of endogenous FOXO3a (data not shown). Of note, the absence of FOXO3a-dependent change in cell cycle distribution also was observed in A549 cells following treatment with benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide, another potent human lung carcinogen [2] (Herzog, in preparation). These results show that FOXO3a sensitizes LAC cells to NNKOAc-induced apoptosis. The increased sensitivity conferred by FOXO3a to NNKOAc suggested that FOXO3a was functionally activated by the cellular effects of this genotoxic carcinogen. As a transcription factor FOXO3a has been shown to localize to the nucleus when stress-activated [14,15]. Therefore, we next investigated FOXO3a sub-cellular localization during NNKOAc exposure. For these experiments H1299 NSCLC cells were used as they expressed easily detectable levels of wild-type endogenous FOXO3a. Several NSCLC cell lines have been analyzed for FOXO3a inactivation (Herzog, in preparation). Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy we observed an increase in FOXO3a localization to the nucleus within 4 h of treatment with 30 M NNKOAc compared with vehicle treated cells (Fig. 3). These results indicated localization of FOXO3a in response to NNKOAc consistent with its functional activation. These cells also underwent apoptosis following NNKOAc treatment (data not shown). FOXO3a is a stress-activated transcription factor that has been shown to regulate the expression of numerous genes in various experimental systems [14,15]. Previous studies have shown that FOXO mutants that were rendered unresponsive to negative regulation by Akt were constitutively active [9,14,20]. However, the transcriptional activity of wild-type FOXO3a in tumor cells or in

response to carcinogenic stress has not been reported. Therefore, we next investigated whether wild-type FOXO3a was transcriptionally activated by NNKOAc in H358 cells. Following transfection with wild-type FOXO3a or control vector cells were treated for 6 h with a cytotoxic dose (30 M) of NNKOAc or vehicle (DMSO). DMSO was used as vehicle at a 1/1000 (v/v) ratio with the medium, which had no effect on cell viability (data not shown). Expression microarray analysis was then performed on the isolated RNA to determine the expression profiles of cells after FOXO3a restoration and stressactivation by NNKOAc. Expression microarray analysis was used to directly examine the functional activation of FOXO3a by NNKOAc, and to characterize the elicited transcriptional response. As described in Section 2, ANOVA was used to determine significant changes in expression from experimental replicates for each pair-wise comparison. Expression profiles of FOXO3a transfected cells were determined after 24 h in the absence of cellular stress. FOXO3a alone under normal growth conditions mediated the up-regulation of 232 genes and the down-regulation of 19 (Fig. 4A). However, following treatment with NNKOAc an additional 398 genes were up-regulated and 130 genes were down-regulated (Fig. 4A). Four hundred-forty of these changes were unique to this experimental group (Fig. 4B). For comparison, vector control cells were identically treated with NNKOAC. This resulted in the up-regulation of 90 genes and the down-regulation of 11. Of these changes, 54 were unique to this treatment group (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that FOXO3a elicited a distinct transcription program in response to NNKOAc. Moreover, the disproportionately large number of genes modulated by FOXO3a in response to NNKOAc compared with the vector control cells treated with NNKOAc suggested that FOXO3a elicits a broad response to this carcinogen. The data from the microarray

analysis also were validated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, several examples of which are shown in Fig. 4C. Genes regulated in a statistically significant manner in each pairwise comparison (e.g. FOXO3a vs. control vector) were subjected to principle component analysis. This analysis allows samples to be compared and clustered with each axis representing a linear combination of genes that best account for the variance between samples. The FOXO3a transfected cells segmented from the empty vector along the first component. The combination of FOXO3a and NNKOAc clustered farther along the second component than NNKOAc treatment alone suggesting that the effect exerted by FOXO3a and NNKOAc was additive or synergistic (Fig. 4D). This is consistent with the induction of a distinct FOXO3a-mediated transcription program by NNKOAc. The array data was next sorted by function to ascertain the likely cellular effect of the transcription program elicited by FOXO3a in response to NNKOAc. Ingenuity Systems Pathway Analysis software was used to sort the changes according to biological process. The processes found to be most significantly affected by FOXO3a alone

were cell growth and proliferation, RNA post-transcriptional modification, cellular assembly and organization, cell­cell interaction, and protein synthesis (Table 1). Those most significantly involved in the FOXO3a-mediated response to NNKOAc were cell growth and proliferation, protein synthesis, gene expression, and cell death (Table 2). The biological processes most significantly affected by expression changes caused by NNKOAc in H358 cells in the absence of exogenous FOXO3a were cancer, cell growth and proliferation, cell death, and small molecule biochemistry (Supplemental Table 1). These results are consistent with previous reports that examined FOXO3a constitutive activation in the presence and absence of stress [10­15,19]. However, it shows for the first time the extent of FOXO3a's response to carcinogenic stress. The significant changes in expression were next overlaid onto Ingenuity Systems Networks to identify biological networks frequently modulated by FOXO3a and NNKOAc. The networks with the greatest involvement due to the activation of FOXO3a by NNKOAc are shown in Fig. 5. As expected these networks consisted of the biological functions most frequently modulated by the interaction

between FOXO3a and NNKOAc, as shown in Table 2. The networks most commonly affected by the interaction between FOXO3a and NNKOAc were those with roles in cancer, protein synthesis, and cellular organization (Fig. 5). By comparison the networks modulated by FOXO3a in the absence of carcinogenic stress were those active in reproductive development, hematological disorders, carbohydrate metabolism, and cell signaling (Supplemental Fig. 1). Interestingly, the latter result is consistent with reports showing that female FOXO3a-deficient mice are susceptible to abnormal oocyte maturation [25], and that FOXOs are critical for hematopoietic stem cell resistance to oxidative stress [26]. NNKOAc causes DNA damage through a process of nucleotide pyridyloxobutylation [3,24]. The relatively bulky adducts that are formed are repaired by nucleotide excision repair [3]. Our results show that this process may be activated by FOXO3a via upregulation of POLR2, POLR2H, and POLR2F after NNKOAc exposure (Fig. 5A).

tive transcription start site matching that of the Forkhead (FOXO) binding element (FHBE) [(G/A)(T/C)AAA(T/C)A] of POLR2A. No such elements were detected in the 5 -UTR of POLR2F or POLR2H. Interestingly, the expression of Cytochrome P-450 1B1 (CYP1B1), which metabolically activates NNK to mutagenic species', also was upregulated in this response [2,3]. Also consistent with previous reports, both GADD45A and GADD45B were up-regulated by FOXO3a in response to NNKOAc. GADD45 is an effector of FOXO3a with a potential role in a FOXO3a-elicited DNA damage response [9]. Both of these genes were confirmed to contain putative 5 -UTR FHBE sites (Table 3). These results suggest a potential role of FOXO3a in NNK metabolism and NNK-induced DNA damage repair, through both direct and indirect transcriptional regulation. SMAD4 is a tumor suppressor with which FOXO3a has been shown to co-regulate the transcription of several genes [27,28]. Its expression was significantly up-regulated by the interaction of

FOXO3a and NNKOAc, most likely through direct regulation of an FHBE in its 5 -UTR (Table 3). NF B, a pro-survival transcription factor [29], was significantly down-regulated by FOXO3a following NNKOAc treatment (Fig. 5B). In addition, NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 were both up-regulated by FOXO3a in the presence of NNKOAc; NOTCH2 contains an FHBE site in its 5 -UTR (Table 3). These two ligands are determinants of stem cell fate and may also participate in cell differentiation in response to DNA damage in some cell types [30,31]. These results suggest transcriptional cross-talk between NNKOAcactivated FOXO3a and other regulatory pathways that determine cell fate. Although a number of potentially significant changes are likely to emerge from the large body of data obtained from this study, of primary interest to us was the identification of genes that might play a role in the execution of apoptosis elicited by FOXO3a in response to NNKOAc. A total of 71 genes encoding functions related to the process of programmed cell death were found to be modulated by the interaction between FOXO3a and NNKOAc. Of these genes, 54 had functions related to apoptosis (Table 3). Interestingly, a large majority of these genes had not previously been identified as effectors of FOXO3a. Therefore, we examined the 5 -upstream sequences of these genes for the presence of FHBE sites. Fortyfour (81.5%) of these genes contained putative FHBE sites within 3 kb upstream of their transcription start sites (Table 3). These results indicate that FOXO3a activates a pro-apoptotic response to NNKOAc within the context of relatively broad anti-carcinogenic transcriptional program.

4. Discussion Cigarette smoke contains numerous genotoxic carcinogens, such as TSNA and PAH, that cause human lung cancer [2]. The substantial increase in lung cancer risk in smokers suggests that key functions that normally protect cells from cancer causing DNA damage are overwhelmed or selectively lost during lung carcinogenesis [2,32]. Also, because of the diversity of chemical carcinogens in cigarette smoke, numerous functions are likely engaged in the protection against lung carcinogenesis [2,3,32]. Here we show that FOXO3a directs an anti-carcinogenic response to NNK-induced DNA damage. FOXO3a activation was indicated by its localization to the nucleus and its implementation of a distinct transcriptional program in response to NNKOAc, which culminated in apoptosis. FOXO3a modulated the expression of a large number of genes (n = 440) following a short-term exposure (6 h) to NNKOAc. Importantly, none of these changes was evident in the same cells absent NNKOAc treatment. Furthermore, only 54 genes displayed significant FOXO3a-independent changes in expression following NNKOAc treatment. This demonstrates that FOXO3a directs a robust transcriptional program in response to this carcinogen. FOXO3a most significantly modulated the expression of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation, protein synthesis, gene expression, and cell death in response to NNKOAc. Although FOXO3a alone also very significantly modulated genes with roles in cell growth and proliferation, and gene expression, the commonality of actual genes regulated by FOXO3a in the presence and absence of NNKOAc was quite low. This further demonstrates that NNKOAc induces a distinct program of FOXO3a-mediated transcription. Interestingly, these results also suggest that FOXO3a may elicit its effect in part through secondary or indirect means as evidenced by its modulation of genes with roles in the biochemical processes of gene expression, protein synthesis, and protein trafficking. FOXO3a was found to regulate the expression of numerous genes associated with cancer. This includes up-regulation of CYP1B1 which metabolizes NNK to DNA reactive species, and the upregulation of POLR genes involved in the repair of NNK-DNA adducts

[3]. Up-regulation of SMAD4, a tumor necrosis factor- (TNF- ) responsive transcription factor, by NNKOAc-activated FOXO3a also is novel. These two transcription factors cooperate in the expression of a distinct group of genes that include GADD45A and GADD45B [27]. The apparent direct up-regulation of SMAD4, GADD45A and GADD45B by FOXO3a in response to NNKOAc suggests that FOXO3a reinforces certain functions by a combination of transcriptional mechanisms. In this regard, NFÄB was down-regulated by the interaction of FOXO3a and NNKOAc, suggesting that this pro-survival transcription factor, which can be activated by Akt, is indirectly repressed by NNKOAc-activated FOXO3a. The results of this study also suggest that FOXO3a transcriptional activation by NNKOAc accounts for the FOXO3a-dependent increase in apoptosis observed in NNKOAc treated cells. Fifty-four genes with roles in apoptosis were modulated by the interaction between FOXO3a and NNKOAc, which represented 10% of the total genes affected by this combination of factors. Eighty-four percent of these genes were found to possess FHBE sites in their 5 -upstream regulatory regions, suggesting direct modulation by FOXO3a. This set of genes includes some reported effectors of FOXO3a (e.g. GADD45A and GADD45B); however, the majority has potentially novel roles as FOXO3a effectors, and in lung carcinogenesis [9,14,26]. Interestingly absent from this set of apoptosis-related genes regulated by FOXO3a in response to NNKOAc are BIM and BNIP3. Both of these are pro-apoptotic genes that have been shown to be directly upregulated by FOXO3a following exposure to anti-cancer drugs in breast and colon cancer cell lines [19,32,33]. This suggests that their up-regulation by FOXO3a may not be instrumental in NNKOAcinduced apoptosis in the lung cancer cell line used. Further study is needed to investigate the roles of the individual genes implicated as potential effectors of FOXO3a-directed apoptosis induced by NNKOAc. DNA-damaging carcinogens, such as NNK, cause cancer by increasing the mutation rate and genetic variation from which changes advantageous for tumor development can be selected [4,35­38]. This implicitly suggests that exposure to sub-toxic levels of carcinogens can be advantageous for tumor development [35]. Numerous cellular functions with roles in the DNA damage response are deregulated or defective in cancer, arguably because they increase the mutation rate or increase tolerance to DNA damage [35,36,38]. Many of them predispose to genetic instability and cancer [34­37]. This suggests that certain functions that prevent carcinogen-induced DNA damage will be selectively inactivated during carcinogenesis if they confer an advantageous increase in mutation rate or tolerance to DNA damage. Although p53 has broad tumor suppressor activity, it indeed functions to protect against the propagation of cancer causing DNA damage [39,40,41]. With the identification of FOXO3a as a novel target of gene deletion in early stage LAC in smokers and in mouse carcinogen-induced LAC, the findings of this study suggest that FOXO3a may be selectively inactivated in these tumors because it suppresses the tumorigenic potential of DNA-damaged cells. FOXOs are functionally antagonistic of PI3K/Akt, a key cancer signaling pathway, suggesting FOXO inactivation as a potential mechanism PI3K/Akt constitutive activation in cancer [20]. However, the various FOXO knockout mice reportedly lack an overt tumor-prone phenotype [25]. Also, FOXO3a germline inactivation increased susceptibility of pituitary and ovarian tumors, but did not increase susceptibility to lung tumors [22]. This is in apparent contrast with our findings of frequent FOXO3a deletions in both human and mouse LAC (Herzog, in preparation). This may be resolved if FOXO3a inactivation alone simply does not predispose mice to LAC, but contributes to malignant progression in the context of other key changes in a developing tumor. Such a role was recently demonstrated for the Lkb1 tumor suppressor, in which Lkb1-deficiency in mice only had a potent effect on lung tumor

development in combination with mutant K-ras [42]. Although our results implicate FOXO3a as a suppressor of lung carcinogenesis, further study is needed to confirm this role as well as the genetic and potential stage-dependent contexts in which it exerts its effect. 5. Conclusion DNA damage from carcinogens in cigarette smoke is a major cause of lung cancer, and NNK exposure in particular has been implicated as a specific cause of human LAC. Here we show that FOXO3a, a stress-activated transcription factor, is functionally activated upon exposure of human LAC cell lines to a DNA-damaging intermediate of NNK metabolism. Upon activation by this metabolite, FOXO3a mediates a large-scale transcriptional program, which includes the differential regulation of a significantly large number of genes with roles in cell growth or proliferation and apoptosis. FOXO3a ultimately elicits an apoptotic cellular outcome in response to this exposure. These results suggest that FOXO3a may play a role in suppressing the propagation of NNK-induced DNA damage, which is suspected to underlie LAC development. Conflict of interest None.
