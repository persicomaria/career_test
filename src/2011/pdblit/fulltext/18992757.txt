We assayed the redox forms of cysteine (reduced [CSH], oxidized [CSSC], and bound to protein [CS-SP]), cysteinylglycine (CGSH; cysteinylgycine disulfide [CGSSGC] and cysteinylglycine-protein mixed disulfide [CGS-SP]), glutathione (GSH; glutathione disulfide [GSSG] and glutathione-protein mixed disulfide [GS-SP]), homocysteine (Hcy; homocystine [HcyS] and homocystine-protein mixed disulfides [bHcy]), and protein sulfhydryls in the plasma of healthy subjects (divided into 8 groups ranging in age from birth to 70 years) and patients with mild hyperhomocysteinemia associated with cardiovascular disease (heart-transplant patients) or vascular atherosclerosis, with or without renal failure. In healthy individuals, levels of disulfides and protein-mixed disulfides were more abundant than those of thiols, and those of protein-thiol mixed disulfides were higher than disulfides. Concentrations of CSH, GSH, and CGSH in the various groups had profiles characterized by a maximum over time. The concentration of Hcy was unchanged up to the age of 30 years, after which it increased. CSSC concentration increased gradually with age, whereas concentrations of the other disulfides were essentially unchanged. By contrast, the concentrations of all protein-thiol mixed disulfides, especially those with CSH, increased gradually with age. Ranks of distribution of the reduced forms changed with age (at birth, CSH > CGSH > GSH > Hcy; in 1- to 2-year-olds, CSH > GSH > CGSH > Hcy; and in 51- to 70-year-olds, CSH > CGSH GSH > Hcy), whereas those of disulfides and protein-thiol mixed disulfides were substantially unchanged (in all age groups, CSSC > CGSSGC > GSSG HcyS and CS-SP > CGS-SP > bHcy > GS-SP). In patients with pathologic conditions, plasma levels of disulfide forms CSSC, HcyS, CS-SP, and bHcy were significantly increased, whereas other redox forms of thiols were unchanged or showed variations opposite (increasing or decreasing) to control values. Maximal increases in disulfides and proteinthiol mixed disulfides were associated with renal failure. Our data suggest that increases in plasma bHcy concentrations in subjects with pathologic conditions

Nonprotein thiols and PSHs have great antioxidant properties that serve to block the noxious actions of electrophile agents and free radicals. The biochemical function of PSH depends on two characteristics: the nucleophilicity and SH accessibility (or protein conformation), the various combinations of which may generate a vast range of protein reactivity1 and biologic properties when PSHs belong to functional groups.2 PSHs and NPSHs compete for the same reactions, conjugations, and reductions of electrophilic substrates and are also involved in biochemical equilibria with disulfides and protein-thiol mixed disulfides (eg, GSSG PSH  GSSP GSH [1]), known as thiol/disulfide (SH/SS)­ exchange reactions or glutathionylations. The SH/SS-exchange reactions are major activators of SHdependent biologic processes.2 Cells are equipped with a variety of nonenzyme and enzyme sources3 with strong reducing potential and are characterized by high concentrations of PSH and GSH (mmol/mL) and by low concentrations of disulfides and protein-thiol mixed disulfides (e.g., GS-SP). For example, RBCs are rich in PSHs and antioxidant enzymes and have GSH-regenerating systems (GSH redox recycling) to protect tissues from prolonged oxidative stress elicited by ROS.4 ­ 8 During oxidative stress, cells are reversibly subject to rapid decreases in the GSH/GSSG ratio (normal range 30 ­300) and increased glutathionylation,9,10 recovery of which occurs at the expense of glucose and with the support of other thiols (cysteine).11,12 In contrast to cells, extracellular fluid (plasma) is relatively poor in thiols and antioxidant enzymes, and different defenses against ROS are at work. Plasma is devoid of GSH redox recycling, and its PSHs consist almost exclusively of albumin (with a theoretical PSH

concentration of about 0.6 mmol/L). Moreover, the major plasma NPSHs--CSH, CGSH, Hcy, and GSH-- are present at micromolar levels13­17 and represent 1% to 2% of total thiol concentrations. NPSHs may be maintained at low levels by inherently prooxidant activity elicited by copper bound to albumin.18 The need for better understanding of the redox state of plasma thiols stems from observations that changes in levels of plasma thiols are associated with various human disorders. It is not known whether these changes represent an epiphenomenon or a factor in the further evolution of disease. Indeed, hyperhomocysteinemia, originally associated with atherosclerosis19 and then with coronary-artery disease,20 is at present considered an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction and stroke.21­23 Although Hcy is harmful to the human cardiovascular system,24,25 the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. Various hypotheses, not necessarily exclusive, explaining Hcy toxicity have been proposed. For example, Hcy may be toxic as a result of its ability to elicit a prooxidant state,26 inhibition of cellular methylations,27 or formation of Hcy-thiolactone, which avidly forms Hcy-N-protein adducts,28 ­30 notably with low-density lipoproteins.31,32 Albumin-SS-Hcy, which is somewhat less abundant than Hcy-Nprotein in normal human blood,30 may also be a mediator of endothelial-cell dysfunction.33 Information on the redox status of plasma Hcy and other thiols in human disease is limited. Most clinical studies have been focused on the measurement of total thiols and not on their various redox forms. In an earlier study we examined the redox state of plasma thiols in HT patients.34 In this study, we investigated plasma concentrations of major plasma thiols CSH, CGSH, Hcy, GSH, and PSH, as well as their free disulfides and

protein-bound mixed disulfides, in healthy subjects (birth to 70 years) and in patients with mild hyperhomocysteinemia (ie, patients with cardiovascular diseases or vascular atherosclerosis with and without RF). We sought to determine how the redox state of plasma thiols is affected by age and to ascertain to what extent accumulation of bHcy in plasma of patients may be a consequence of putative ROS production.
METHODS
Subjects. Twelve full-term newborn infants in the Neonatology Division of the University Hospital of Siena were enrolled in this study. Other healthy individuals of various ages ( 1­ to 70 years) were enrolled after verification of their total recovery from any infectious diseases at least a month before recruitment. Other normal subjects were recruited from the university staff. Five groups of patients were selected: HT patients with normal renal function, patients with RF, HT-RF patients, vascular ultrasound tomography­assessed atherosclerotic patients without (VA) and with renal failure (VA-RF). RF was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of more than 1.5 mg/dL (assessed with the use of the Syncron Chemical System LX 20; Beckman, Palo Alto, Calif). All HT patients were taking cyclosporine, but none was taking vitamin supplementation. We obtained informed consent from infants' families and from the adult patients in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The clinical characteristics of the control and patient groups are shown in Table I. Sampling and processing of blood. Blood was drawn by means of venipuncture into plastic tubes containing EDTA and immediately centrifuged for 20 seconds at 10,000g to separate the plasma. Plasma samples in which hemolysis had taken place, indicated by analysis of the hemoglobin spectrum (peak 541 nm), were discarded, although under our experimental conditions, no hemolysis of plasma samples was observed. Thiols, disulfides, and protein-bound disulfides were processed in accordance with the procedure described by Mansoor et al.14 The remaining plasma sample was kept at 0°C until protein sulfhydryl determination could be carried out. Analysis of thiols. Protein SH groups were determined spectrophotometrically with the use of DTNB. We added 50

L of plasma to 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in a cuvette and started the reaction by adding 20 L of 20 mmol/L DTNB in phosphate buffer (the reaction was ended after 15 minutes). We then deproteinized 100 L of plasma using 6% (wt/ vol) trichloroacetic acid and incubated the supernatant with 1 mmol/L mBrB at neutral pH under saturating conditions of solid NaHCO3 in the dark for 15 minutes. We acidified 100 L with 10 L of 37 % HCl (to a pH of 3 to 4) and then loaded it on the HPLC column so that we could detect derivatized thiols. Albumin concentrations were assayed with the use of the Synchron Chemical System LX 20. Analysis of disulfides. We pretreated 100 L of plasma with 5 mmol/L N-ethylmaleimide (final concentration) for 3 minutes. After deproteinization with 6% TCA (final concentration), the excess NEM in the supernatant was extracted with the use of dichloromethane (0.2 mL of sample plus 2 mL of dichloromethane), and then the sample was treated with 1 mmol/L DTT at neutral pH (through the addition of solid NaHCO3) at room temperature for 20 minutes. We then added an excess of mBrB (3 mmol/L) and incubated and processed the sample as described above. Analysis of protein-thiol mixed disulfides. The protein pellet from NEM-pretreated plasma samples used to assay disulfides was washed twice with 1.5 % TCA to remove traces of NEM and low­molecular-weight compounds. The pellet was resuspended in 0.4 mL of 2 mmol/L DTT in water and maintained at neutral pH in the presence of saturating NaHCO3 for 20 minutes. After centrifugation, the supernatant (100 L) was deproteinized with the use of 6% TCA and then centrifuged. Soluble thiols of the supernatant were reacted with 5 mmol/L mBrB as described above. We injected samples into a ChromSep C18 column (250 4 mm) (Varian, Lake Forest, Calif). Solvent A was 0.25% (vol/vol) acetic acid (pH 3.09) and solvent B was methanol. The elution profile was as follows: 0 to 8 minutes, 20% solvent B; 8 to 15 minutes, 20% to 40% solvent B; 15 to 25 minutes, 40% to 10% solvent B. Retention times were 6.0, 6.7, 10.1, and 12.2 minutes for CSH, CGSH, Hcy, and GSH, respectively. Statistical analysis. The results are reported as mean SD; CVs are expressed as the percentage ratio of SD to mean. Two control groups were included in the study of age-related thiol variations: newborns and 51- to 70-year-olds. We used Student's t test to evaluate statistically significant differences.

Distribution of plasma of PSH, NPSH, tCSH, tCGSH, tHcy, and tGSH concentrations by age. The profiles of PSH

Distribution of plasma thiol, disulfide and protein-thiol

and NPSH concentration (sum of all reduced thiols measured on HPLC) were constant over time and characterized by a curve with a maximum over time, respectively (Fig 1, A), with the NPSH concentration lowest at birth and in the 51- to 70-year-olds and with a peak in the 1- to 2-year-olds. By contrast, the profiles of total plasma levels of individual thiols were specific for each compound. For example, t-CSH and t-Hcy concentrations showed increasing trends over time (Fig 1, B), whereas the concentrations of t-GSH and t-CGSH (Fig 1, C) demonstrated curves similar to that seen for NPSH (bell-shaped). In particular, the concentrations of t-CSH in the various age groups were 10 times greater than those of t-CGSH and 28 times greater than the concentrations of t-Hcy and t-GSH. Variations in tCSH and t-GSH concentrations between newborns and 1- to 2-year-olds were rather high (1.5- and 2.4-fold, respectively). Changes in t-CSH concentration with age were significantly correlated with changes in the tHcy concentration (r 0.84, P .05, n 8), whereas we detected no correlation between t-GSH and t-CSH concentrations. This finding confirms a more obvious link

Except for Hcy, the profiles of thiols were generally characterized by a curve displaying a maximum over time (Fig 2, A; Table II). In all groups except newborns and 51- to 70year-olds, CSH concentrations were about 2 and 4 times greater than the concentrations of GSH and CGSH, respectively, and 50 times greater than the concentration of Hcy. However, the order of plasma thiol concentrations varied with age. For example, the order observed for newborns (CSH CGSH GSH Hcy) was different in 1- to 2-year-olds, in whom GSH was more abundant than CGSH (CSH GSH CGSH Hcy). Yet another order was observed in 51to 70-year-olds (CSH CGSH GSH Hcy). Disulfides. The profiles of disulfides with regard to age (Fig 2, B; Table III) were different from those of thiols. CSSC increased with age (Fig 2, B), whereas the concentrations of most other disulfides did not change, with 2 exceptions: 3- to 5-year-olds and 6- to 10-yearolds, in whom the concentrations of HcyS were lower than those in 51- to 70-year-olds. Except in newborns, the mean concentration of CSSC was about 10 times greater than the concentration of CGSSGC and about 50 times greater than the
mixed disulfide concentrations by age. Thiols.

concentrations of HcyS and GSSG; unlike the distribution of thiols, disulfide concentrations maintained the same order (CSSC CGSSGC GSSG HcyS) in all age groups. It was particularly interesting to us that the concentrations of GSSG and HcyS were nearly equal, whereas in the case of thiols, the GSH concentration was in most cases 20 times greater than the concentration of Hcy. No significant differences in the concentrations of CGSSGC and GSSG were observed over time (data not shown). In particular, CGSSGC 1.59 (3­5 years) to 6.96 2.26 ranged from 5.44 mol/L (16 ­30 years) and GSSG ranged from 1.63 1.38 (newborns) to 1.01 0.35 mol/L (3­5 years). Protein-thiol mixed disulfides. The time profiles of protein-thiol mixed disulfide concentrations in plasma (Fig 2, C; Table III) were different from those of thiols

and disulfides. The concentrations of CS-SP and bHcy (Fig 2, C) increased with age in a similar fashion and demonstrated a significant correlation (r 0.88, P .05, n 8). CGS-SP concentration increased with age but less markedly so than did CS-SP (Table III). In contrast, GS-SP concentration increased from newborns to 1- to 2-year olds and then remained essentially unchanged. The total mean CS-SP concentration for all age groups was 12 times greater than that of CGS-SP, 20 times greater than that of bHcy, and 65 times greater than that of GS-SP, and this order did not change with age. Correlations. We observed other significant correlations as well. For example, concentrations of proteinthiol mixed disulfides of CSH and Hcy were significantly correlated with the corresponding disulfides

DISCUSSION

XS-SP (Fig 2, C; Table III) represents the theoretical PSH concentration (or total PSH) in human plasma (Fig 4). The total PSH concentration was constant in healthy individuals of different ages, except for newborns (Fig 4), and their mean (newborns excluded) was 578 6 mol/L (n 7, CV 1.0%), similar to albumin concentrations in human plasma ( 600 mol/L). In the pathology groups (Fig 4), the total PSH concentration was 549 34 mol/L (n 5; CV 6.2%). The total PSH concentration of the pathology groups differed (significantly) by 5% from that of healthy subjects.

Our findings show that variations in the redox forms of plasma thiols in healthy subjects over time are rather complex and denote a lack of thiol-regenerating systems. Disulfide and protein-mixed disulfide concentrations are much higher than NPSH concentrations, and protein thiol mixed disulfide concentrations are higher than those of disulfides. Indeed, the percentage of NPSH with respect to total thiols was very low (range of NPSH variation over time 4.1%­ 8.0%) and in line with the literature. The relative abundance of each redox component and the concentration rank of the various compounds changed gradually with age. However, the major modifications were observed for reduced thiols. For example, in newborns the percentages of CSH and CGSH with respect to their total amounts (t-CSH and t-CGSH, Fig. 1) were nearly equal (4.8% and 4.5%, respectively) whereas those of GSH and Hcy were 16% and 3.4%, respectively. These values changed in 1- to 2-year-olds, in whom CSH (from 4.8% to 5.4%) and Hcy (from 3.4% to 3.5%) remained nearly constant, whereas CGSH (from 4.5% to 15%) and GSH (from 16% to 62%) changed more markedly, modifying the concentration rank from CSH CGSH GSH Hcy to CSH GSH CGSH Hcy.

Disulfides and protein-thiol mixed disulfides displayed the same rank of distribution by age (CSSC CGSSGC GSSG Hcy and CS-SP CGS-SP bHcy GS-SP, respectively). In particular, for most compounds and groups, the protein-thiol mixed disulfide/disulfide ratios were nearly constant and equal to 2, except for the GS-SP/GSSG ratio of newborns and bHcy/HcyS in all groups. Moreover, bHcy/HcyS varied from 3.1 (newborns) to 7.4 (6- to 10-year-olds) which suggests and confirms that Hcy is more readily Sthiolated to albumin than the other SH compounds. The biologic reason reduced thiols have relatively low concentrations in plasma compared with cells is unclear. Indeed, plasma is relatively rich in other reductants, such as bilirubin, uric acid, and vitamin C, which may compensate for the lack of reduced thiols.7,8 The low reducing potential of plasma thiols decreases further with age. Indeed, a decrease in GSH/GSSG and CSH/CSSC ratios with age has been reported in healthy individuals.35 and is confirmed by our findings. The modulation of redox forms of the same compound by age and pathology and differences between some redox forms of different compounds reflect complex biochemical and biologic events linked to tissue metabolism, plasma-tissue exchanges, and the intrinsic prooxidant nature of plasma proteins,18 and activation of SH/SS-exchange reactions.33 For example, depending on their chemical characteristics, plasma thiols are oxidized at different rates by metal-bound proteins (copper-bound albumin)18 and oxidation rates of CSH and CGSH are faster than those of GSH and Hcy. Differences in oxidation rates may explain why the GSH/t-GSH ratio was higher than CGSH/t-CGSH for 1- to 50-years-olds. GSH, normally exported from cells into plasma, is presumably partly hydrolyzed to CGSH by renal -glutamyl transpeptidase. CGSH is then presumably oxidized to disulfide more easily than GSH, the ratio CGSH/t-CGSH being much lower than that of GSH/t-GSH. The percentages of Hcy/t-Hcy and GSH/t-GSH ratios (2.9% and 47%, respectively, means of all ratios) displayed differences that cannot be explained by the corresponding oxidation rates. Because plasma Hcy and GSH are oxidized at similar rates,18 it is more plausible to assume that Hcy activates sulfhydryl/disulfide exchange reactions better than GSH. Sengupta et al33 recently demonstrated that CS-SP in human albumin (or plasma) may rapidly exchange with Hcy, according to the reaction CS-SP Hcy  PSH CS-Hcy  bHcy CSH (2). In turn, the mixed disulfide (CS-Hcy) formed presumably finds the protein in a more appropriate transient conformation to form bHcy. Preliminary data suggest that Hcy is faster than GSH at dethiolating

protein-thiol mixed disulfides of albumin (study in progress). In line with this thinking, the activation of reaction 2 may explain why bHcy accumulates in both healthy (Fig. 2, C) and unhealthy individuals (Fig 3, C). The concentration of bHcy is proportionally much higher than that of CS-SP in health and disease, and the concentration of Hcy is proportionally much lower than those of CSH and other thiols. Although the SH of albumin is characterized by a relatively low pKa of about 6,36 which should confer a fast reaction rate, the reaction rate of the protein is relatively low37­39 as a result of steric impedance.33 However, in reaction 2, CS-Hcy finds more appropriate conditions under which to generate bHcy. Hyperhomocysteinemia is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is assumed to be the cause of tissue injury resulting from increased ROS production.26,40 The pathologic role of ROS is supported by results indicating increased plasma levels of disulfides and protein-thiol mixed disulfides in disease41,42 and is confirmed by our data (Fig 3, B and C). Despite the plausible pathogenetic action of ROS, we assume that increases in HcyS and bHcy, such as those seen in disease (Fig 3, B and C), are related not always to ROS production but rather to activation of thioldisulfide exchange reactions (equation 2).43 This interpretation does not deny the action of ROS but explains better why other thiols change little. For example, GSSG did not vary with respect to controls and, in VA patients, decreased significantly instead of increasing as might be expected in situations of oxidative stress (Table VI). Increased oxidation in tissues is associated with increased efflux of GSSG from cells44,45 and with possible increases in plasma GSSG levels that we did not observe in this study. Besides, on the basis of the effects of ROS, GSH was expected to decrease in patients rather than remain unchanged (Table V). The results shown in Fig 4 are further confirmation of the modest effect of ROS on plasma thiols in freeradical pathologies because the small decrease in total PSH of diseased subjects (possibly 5%; see Results) suggests a limited presence of higher oxidation forms of sulfur (such as sulfinic or sulfonic acid). By contrast, accentuated oxidation of plasma proteins, especially carbonylation of albumin, has been found in patients with chronic RF.46,47 It therefore remains to be clarified why plasma thiols, which are extensively oxidized in disease states mediated by ROS (XS-SP are about 30% of total PSH), are not subject to more severe oxidation than are other aminoacid residues that, on the contrary, are easily carbonylated. Our results show for the first time that the population of plasma thiols in their various redox forms is relatively poor (especially GSH and t-GSH) in newborns

with respect to adults. Plasma thiols must therefore play a minimal role in newborn antioxidant defenses exerted by blood. In contrast, RBC in newborns at birth are characterized by higher GSH concentrations, greater efficiency of GSH redox recycling, and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than adults.6,7,48,49 This is the result of a greater need to eliminate ROS produced during tissue maturation by increased oxygen tension at birth.50 In conclusion, this study shows that the antioxidant potential of plasma thiols is relatively low because disulfide forms are more abundant than reduced thiols in normal individuals in a wide age bracket. The order of total thiols was t-CSH ( 250 mol/L) t-CGSH ( 25 mol/L) t-Hcy t-GSH ( 9 mol/L) for all ages, from newborns to 70-year-olds. The small differences in oxidized thiol forms observed in different age groups may be an expression of exchange with tissues or plasma metabolic reactions. In turn, greater differences in the concentrations of reduced forms (eg, GSH and Hcy) may exist in relation to different rates of thiol oxidation and activation of complex exchange reactions with proteins. Phenomena of oxidative stress in normal individuals can therefore be considered relatively well controlled because theoretical PSH levels (Fig 4) were nearly constant between 1 and 70 years. In the various disease states, the effects of ROS were more accentuated, but all changes in plasma disulfides and protein-thiol mixed disulfides are probably not ROS-dependent. Further studies are therefore necessary to determine why certain PSH modifications (eg, sulfinic and sulfonic acids) are less frequent than others (albumin carbonylation) in pathologic conditions known to be ROS-related.
