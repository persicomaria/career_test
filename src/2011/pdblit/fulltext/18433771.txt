Asymmetric binding of protein homodimers to DNA, which has been observed in a number of protein­ DNA complexes, leads to subtle structural differences between the two subunits. Such structural differences are frequently observed when the subunits form cognate and non-cognate protein ­DNA complexes, respectively. Analysis of these structural effects on binding specificity should provide insight into the mechanism of protein ­DNA recognition. We previously derived empirical potential functions for specific nucleotide base-amino acid interactions from statistical analyses of the structures of many protein ­ DNA complexes and used a combinatorial threading procedure to evaluate the fitness of the DNA sequences involved. We then introduced Z-scores to measure the specificity with which proteins bind to DNA within complexes, as compared to random DNA sequences. Here, we examined in detail the structural effects of asymmetric and cognate/non-cognate binding on specificity. Marked differences in the specificity of DNA binding were observed for the two subunits of l repressor, the glucocorticoid receptor, and for transcription factors containing a Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster domain, which are known to bind asymmetrically to DNA. Moreover, the differences in the specificity with which Bam H1 and Eco RV endonucleases bind to their cognate and non-cognate DNA sequences were clearly detected using this approach; indeed, analysis of Eco RV binding enabled us to show the cooperative effect of sequence and structure on binding specificity. The present results demonstrate the utility of this approach when examining the structure-specificity relationship in protein ­DNA recognition, as subtle structural differences in symmetric/ asymmetric and cognate/non-cognate binding were clearly shown to cause marked differences in specificity. This method can also be used as a tool for checking new structures of protein­ DNA complexes for their specificity.

analyses of various protein­ DNA complexes have provided a rich source of information on protein ­ DNA recognition. It is now known, for instance, that a number of proteins bind to DNA as either homodimers or heterodimers. One obvious benefit of dimerization is that by varying heterodimeric constituents, diversity of target-site recognition and function is achieved; moreover, dimerization may also provide a kinetic advantage for DNA binding.1 Homodimers, which include bZIP, homeodomains, Rel/NF-kB and helix-loop-helix family members, often bind to target DNA

We first derived the statistical potential energy as described6 and then updated the potential. This entailed removing enzyme­DNA complexes that did not show specific binding from the dataset and adding recently characterized non-redundant sequence-specific complexes. To construct the data set, FASTA23 was used to compare the amino acid sequence of each protein­ DNA complex in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)24 with the amino acid sequences of the 52 non-redundant protein­DNA complexes used in our previous study. If the new complex was not homologous with the existing sequences, as judged by sequence homology indicating ,25% identity, then it was included in the non-redundant set. This process was repeated to derive the final set of 62 protein ­DNA complexes (Table 1). Derivation of statistical potentials is described in detail elsewhere.6 Briefly, the potential for a pair made up of nucleotide base a and amino acid b at a relative position s is defined as: DEab ðsÞ ¼ 2RTln f ab ðsÞ f ðsÞ

where f(s ) is the relative frequency of occurrence of any amino acid at position s against any base; f ab(s ) is the equivalent relative frequency of occurrence of amino acid residue a against base b; and R and T ( ¼ 298 K) are the gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively. The relative position of an amino acid, we used the position of the Ca atom, with respect to a base was defined in a coordinate system where the origin was the N9 atom of A or G and the N1 atom of C or T. The x-axis was the N9-C4 vector for A or G and the N1-C2 vector for C or T. The y-axis was in the same plane as that defined by a purine or a pyrimidine and perpendicular to the x-axis in a right-hand reference frame.6 Assuming the additivity of potentials,10,25 the sum of the potentials for a given DNA sequence in a complexed form was defined as the energy for the sequences. The energy for a particular sequence, in a crystal structure for example, was normalized to measure specificity by the Z-score against random sequences. The Z-score was defined as (X 2 m )/s, where X is the energy of a particular sequence, m is the mean energy of 50,000 random DNA sequences, and s is the standard deviation. To calculate Z-scores for a particular protein­DNA complex, the complex itself was excluded from the dataset from which the potentials were derived. For the sake of statistical confidence, we did another jackknife-type test, where one more complex structure was removed from the dataset systematically. The standard deviation from this jackknife test is shown in parentheses after the Z-score values. We also did a bootstrapping test, where we decreased the size of dataset by removing complexes randomly and calculated the Z-score (data not shown). This analysis shows that the result is stable against the size change for the present dataset size. Thus, these statistical tests show that our dataset of protein­ DNA complexes provide adequate information for a generally valid structure-based potential. The Z-scores for two half-sites of each complex are sorted as chain 1 and chain 2 according to their values, and the actual chain names in the PDB are shown in parentheses.

One approach to a better understanding of the specificity determinants involved in protein ­DNA recognition is to examine the relationship between structure and specificity within specific and nonspecific protein­ DNA complexes.3 ­ 5 In our earlier work, we showed that the distribution of amino acid residues around nucleotide bases within the structures of protein ­ DNA complexes can be used to derive empirical potentials for their interactions; these potentials can then be used to predict target

sites for DNA binding proteins using a combinatorial threading procedure, and to quantify the specificity with which proteins bind to DNA.6 In addition, these potentials have enabled us to examine the quantitative effects of cognate and non-cognate binding, cooperative binding and DNA deformation on binding specificity.6 For the work presented here, we used structure-based potentials to analyze several different homodimeric and cognate/non-cognate protein­DNA complexes. This

enabled us to quantitatively evaluate how differences in binding specificity are determined by the subtle structural differences observed in symmetric/asymmetric and cognate/non-cognate binding. Symmetric and asymmetric binding to DNA We derived the statistical potentials for baseamino acid interactions based on an updated set of protein­ DNA complex structures (Table 1), and calculated Z-scores representing the specificity of protein­ DNA recognition (see the legend to Table 2 for details). We first examined the Z-scores for dimers and individual protein chains within 23 protein­ DNA complexes belonging to several structural families (Table 2), which were then classified into three groups based on the magnitudes of the Z-score differences (dZ ) between the individual chains of each homodimer: (I) dZ $ 0.5; (II) 0 , dZ , 0.5; and (III) dZ ¼ 0. Obviously, the structures of dimers in group III are 2-fold symmetric, resulting in the two chains having identical binding specificities. In this case, the total Z-score for the dimer is nearly equal to the sum of the individual contributions. In group II, the Z-score differences are rather modest, and the magnitude of the whole-chain Z-scores are always larger than the individual contributions. In group I, the Z-score differences are very significant, but the specificity of the dimer is not enhanced much; in fact, the total Z-scores for some complexes are worse than the monomer Z-scores. Below, we discuss several examples of complexes mostly belonging to group I. Asymmetric binding of bZip transcription factor GCN4 The bZip protein GCN4 binds as a dimer to the pseudo-symmetric sequence 50 -TGA(C/G)TCA-30 . It does not, however, make identical contacts with the two half-sites making up the consensus sequence. The crystal structure of GCN4 complexed with its target AP-1 site (RCSB Protein Data Bank; PDB code: 1YSA), which was solved by Ellenberger et al.,7 reveals that while Arg243 of one GCN4 monomer specifically contacts the central guanine nucleotide, Arg243 from the other monomer forms non-specific hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone. This observation, along with mutational and DNA binding studies, indicates GCN4­ DNA binding to be inherently asymmetric, and suggests that the specific recognition of a single half-site by one GCN4 monomer may be more important than recognition by the other.8 Figure 1 shows the statistical potential energy mapped on the molecular surface of GCN4 bound to DNA. It is apparent that Arg243 in the D chain contributes more to the specific interaction than that in the C chain (chain names are according to PDB). In addition, other amino acid residues (Asn235, Arg234 and Arg241) in the D chain show

lower potential energy. This asymmetry is also clearly reflected by the respective Z-scores for the two chains; 2 2.5 for D chain and 2 0.8 for C chain, as shown in Table 2. These results demonstrate that subtle structural differences in two halves of a dimer complex are correctly reflected by differences in statistical potential energy and Z-scores. Asymmetric binding of l repressor Consideration of the structure shows that the interactions of l repressor with each half of the pseudo-symmetric operator differ significantly, particularly with respect to the N-terminal arm, which is critical for sequence-specific recognition. Indeed, the electron density is strong enough to determine all of the residues of the N-terminal arm interacting with the consensus half of the operator. On the other hand, residues interacting with the non-consensus half are poorly defined,9 indicating the absence of direct contact with basepairs. The Z-scores for the individual monomers reflect this difference, as well as the asymmetric binding to the operator (Table 2), and may reflect the real difference in the recognition of the two halves of the operator. Consistent with this result, systematic base substitutions and binding analyses have shown that base substitutions in the consensus half exert much stronger effects on binding affinity than those in the non-consensus half.10 As residues Lys3, Lys4 and Lys5 are considered to be especially important for recognition,10,11 it was not surprising that deleting these three from chain "b" reduced the Z-scores from 2 2.9 to 2 2.1. Half-site spacing and asymmetric binding within the glucocorticoid receptor ­ DNA complex Luisi et al.12 solved the crystal structure of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain complexed with DNA (1GLU). In that experiment, they used a DNA sequence in which the identical halfsites of an idealized glucocorticoid response element were symmetrically disposed around a spacer of four base-pairs (instead of the naturally occurring three), which yielded a surprising result. One subunit seemed to interact properly with one half-site, but the extra base-pair in the center displaced the second half-site by one base-pair, causing the other subunit to interact with a "noncognate" sequence. Mapping the statistical potential energy on the molecular surface of the glucocorticoid receptor revealed clear differences between the "cognate" and "non-cognate" halves (chains A and B, respectively) of this asymmetric binding: several amino acid residues involved in the cognate binding contribute to the potential energy, whereas none involved in the non-cognate binding do so (Figure 2). The Z-score calculated using chain A as a template was 2 1.8, indicating specific binding, while that obtained using chain B

We also tested another noncognate structure in which the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor was mutated towards the estrogen receptor sequence.13 The Z-sore for that structure (1LAT) was 2 0.6, again showing markedly less specificity than the cognate structure (Table 3). Asymmetric binding of transcription factors containing a Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster domain Another group of related proteins known to bind asymmetrically to DNA are the transcription factors HAP1 (1HWT), GAL4 (1D66) and PPR1

(1PYI).14 ­ 16 HAP1, a member of a family of fungal transcription factors containing a Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster domain, binds as a homodimer to a DNA sequence containing two CGC motifs in a tandem orientation. The structure, determined by King et al.,14 shows that HAP1 binds to its DNA target in a dramatically asymmetric manner. On the other hand, monomers of PPR1 and GAL4 bind to 2-fold symmetrically placed consensus sequences, and whereas the structure of PPR116 is drastically asymmetric, the asymmetry of the structure of GAL415 is less obvious. Our calculated Z-scores for the respective monomers in each complex show that PPR1 is the most asymmetric, followed by GAL4 and then HAP1 (Table 2).

Figure 2. Distribution of statistical potential energy mapped on the molecular surface of the half-sites in the asymmetric binding of glucocorticoid receptor dimer to DNA (PDB code: 1GLU). The DNA has one base-pair more in the central spacer region than is present in the naturally occurring glucocorticoid response element. One monomer (chain A) binds to consensus target sequence (designated as "cognate" binding) and the other (chain B) binds to "non-cognate" sequence. Color codes are the same as for Figure 1.

Cognate/non-cognate binding to DNA: Eco RV endonuclease The crystal structures of Eco RV endonuclease complexed with its cognate DNA decamer GGGATATCCC (recognition sequence underlined) (4RVE) and with a non-cognate octamer CGAGCTCG (2RVE) were resolved by Winkler et al.17 When this enzyme, which functions as a dimer, is bound, the DNA assumes different conformations, depending on the monomer with which it interacts, i.e. the octamer duplex in the non-cognate complex is in the B-DNA conformation, while the cognate DNA is compressed along the axis of the helix, and the major groove is narrowed and deepened. In addition, there is a central kink ° of t 50 A in the cognate complex that is not present in the non-cognate complex. With respect to the enzyme bound in the cognate complex, a recognition loop (residues 182­ 187) makes all the

base-specific contacts with the DNA; by contrast, this loop is poorly ordered in the non-cognate com° plex. Finally, over 1800 A2 more surface area is buried upon formation of the cognate complex than upon formation of the non-cognate complex.17 Consistent with these findings, we obtained a Z-score of 1.0 (Table 3) using the non-cognate complex (2RVE) as a template, reflecting entirely nonspecific binding, and more favorable Z-score (2 1.1) when the cognate complex (4RVE) was used as a template, reflecting the specific binding within that complex. To examine the respective effects of sequence and structure on the specificity of Eco RV ­ DNA recognition in more detail, we considered virtual states of Eco RV in which original DNA sequences of 4RVE (cognate DNA) and 2RVE (non-cognate DNA) were swapped for one another, yielding 4RVE (non-cognate DNA) and 2RVE (cognate DNA), and calculated the Z-scores (Figure 3). We found that the sequence substitution in the 2RVE structure caused the Z-score to change by 2 0.7, while that in the 4RVE structure resulted in a much larger change of 2 2.1. On the other hand, the Z-score change associated with the structural change from 2RVE to 4RVE for the non-cognate sequence was negligible (0.0), while that for the cognate sequence was much larger (2 1.4). Thus, the cognate but not the non-cognate DNA sequence was sensitive to the structural change, and the structure of 4RVE had a greater ability to discriminate DNA sequences than that of 2RVE.

913 Aggarwal's group.5,18 Within the cognate complex, the DNA retains its B-DNA conformation, while the enzyme undergoes a series of conformational changes, including rotation of the subunits and folding of disordered regions. Side-chain atoms, main-chain atoms and bound water molecules all appear to contribute to recognition of the cognate sequence, with interactions occurring in both the major and minor grooves.18 Within the non-cognate complex, by contrast, the enzyme adopts an open configuration, despite there being only a single base-pair change in the recognition sequence, and all of the base-specific interactions and DNA backbone contacts are lost, which may actually facilitate diffusion of the enzyme along the DNA and reformation of contacts at target sequences.5 The maps of statistical potential energy for the cognate (1BHM) and non-cognate (1ESG) structures given in Figure 4 show that the favorable energy surface is more spread in the cognate than in the non-cognate structure. As with Eco RV, the Z-scores for the cognate and non-cognate structures of Bam HI clearly reflected the specific and non-specific binding in the two complexes (Table 3).

Specificity of Protein ­DNA Recognition

Discussion Symmetrical oligomers of proteins are preferred in nature, probably because of the stability and economy of the system. Interaction with DNA can change the structural symmetry, however, leading to quasi-symmetric structures in which identical subunits adopt similar but different conformations.19 In general, dimeric DNA binding proteins bind to palindromic sequences making symmetric contacts with the DNA. This is exemplified by the identical Z-scores for complexes belonging to group III (Table 2). Some changes in the symmetry of monomers in a homodimer binding to DNA are inevitable, however. This can arise either from the pseudo-palindromic nature of the target DNA sequence or from some slight changes at the side-chains interacting with the DNA; small changes in the orientation of the monomers with respect to the DNA may also cause changes in the specificity of interaction; and yet another factor may be the spacing of bases between the halfsites, as revealed by glucocorticoid receptor­ DNA binding. It is also notable that transcription factors GAL4, PPR1 and HAP1 all bind to their respective DNA targets as asymmetric homodimers. As each adopts its asymmetric structure in order to recognize asymmetric DNA targets, King et al.14 concluded that "...the asymmetric configuration of homodimeric proteins may be a biologically resourceful and common mechanism for the recognition of asymmetric targets." This asymmetry in the structures of homodimers is often subtle, making it difficult to determine how the differences in structure are related to the differences in specificity, or which regions are responsible for the difference in specificity. Analysis of structurebased potential energy enabled us to assess quantitatively the asymmetry in specificity caused by structural effects. Both Eco RV and Bam HI are type II restriction endonucleases, a class of enzymes useful for understanding protein ­ DNA selectivity, since they show a very high degree of sequence specificity: even a single base-pair change can reduce their cleavage activity by over 106-fold.20,21 Understanding how these enzymes distinguish cognate sequences from others that differ by just a single base provides vital clues to the selection of correct targets by DNA binding proteins. The structures of cognate and non-cognate complexes of both Eco RV and Bam HI show marked differences in the conformations adopted by these enzymes; particularly notable is the absence of specific contacts by the enzyme in the non-cognate complex and the adoption of a conformation that facilitates diffusion of the enzyme along DNA sequence. These differences in protein conformation within cognate and non-cognate complexes are clearly reflected by the Z-scores obtained for the respective monomers within the complex. As an example, our analysis of Eco RV enabled us to show the cooperative effect of sequence and struc-

ture on specificity, i.e. conformational differences between the cognate and non-cognate complexes were sensitive to the cognate but not the noncognate DNA sequence, and the cognate structure had a greater ability to discriminate DNA sequences than the non-cognate structure. While Eco RV and Bam HI illustrate the importance of stringent and exquisite sequence specificity, the binding of transcription factors and other classes of DNA binding proteins show how small changes in a recognition sequence are tolerated and how a single transcription factor is able to recognize multiple targets, either alone or in combination with a partner (homodimeric or heterodimeric association and DNA binding). Even when homodimers bind to symmetric sequences, both large and small differences in binding specificity between monomers are revealed by the statistical potentials derived from the structures of the protein­ DNA complexes. The present method can thus be used not only to examine the relationship between structure and specificity, but also to assess the specificity of the binding within as yet uncharacterized protein­ DNA complexes.
