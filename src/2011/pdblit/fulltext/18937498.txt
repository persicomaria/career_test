Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is a mononuclear non-heme iron enzyme, which catalyzes the reaction between tryptophan, O2, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to produce 5-hydroxytryptophan and 4ahydroxytetrahydrobiopterin. This is the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter and hormone serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). We have determined the 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure of the catalytic domain (1-100/415-445) of chicken TPH isoform 1 (TPH1) in complex with the tryptophan substrate and an iron-bound imidazole. This is the first structure of any aromatic amino acid hydroxylase with bound natural amino acid substrate. The iron coordination can be described as distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination with His273, His278, and Glu318 (partially bidentate) and one imidazole as ligands. The tryptophan stacks against Pro269 with a distance of 3.9 Å between the iron and the tryptophan C 3 atom that is hydroxylated. The binding of tryptophan and maybe the imidazole has caused the structural changes in the catalytic domain compared to the structure of the human TPH1 without tryptophan. The structure of chicken TPH1 is more compact, and the loops of residues Leu124-Asp139 and Ile367-Thr369 close around the active site. Similar structural changes are seen in the catalytic domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) upon binding of substrate analogues norleucine and thienylalanine to the PAH · BH4 complex. In fact, the chicken TPH1 · Trp · imidazole structure resembles the PAH · BH4 · thienylalanine structure more (root-mean-square deviation for CR atoms of 0.90 Å) than the human TPH1 structure (root-mean-square deviation of 1.47 Å).
Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH,1 EC 1.14.16.4) catalyzes the hydroxylation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of serotonin (1). Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter, and dysfunction of the central serotonergic system is observed in psychiatric disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia (2). Tryptophan hydroxylase exists in two isoforms (3). Isoform 2 (TPH2) is responsible for tryptophan hydroxylation in the brain (4), while isoform 1 (TPH1) mainly is expressed in the peripheral

ABSTRACT:

parts of the body (5) and in the pineal gland (6). In the pineal gland, 5-hydroxytryptophan also serves as a precursor in biosynthesis of the hormone melatonin which is involved in daily rhythm control (7). TPH is part of the enzyme family of tetrahydrobiopterindependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. In addition to TPH, this family includes phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, EC 1.14.16.1) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, EC 1.14.16.2) (8). All three enzymes use tetrahydrobiopterin and O2 to hydroxylate the respective aromatic amino acids and are believed to follow the same reaction mechanism (9, 10). The aromatic amino acid hydroxylases are mononuclear iron oxygenases with the iron coordinated by the two histidines and one glutamate, and this 2-histidine-1-carboxylate facial triad iron coordination is a well-known motif in many mononuclear non-heme iron(II) enzymes (11). The eukaryotic aromatic amino acid hydroxylases all form homotetramers, and each monomer can be divided into an N-terminal regulatory domain, a catalytic domain, and a small tetramerization domain in the C-terminus (8). Different truncation variants of all three aromatic amino acid hydroxylases have been structurally characterized. In the case of PAH, structures of the catalytic domain with iron in the ferrous (PDB entries 1J8T and 1J8U) and ferric state (PDB entry 1PAH) are available (12, 13), with and without the cosubstrate 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (BH4) (PDB entries 1J8U and 1J8T, respectively) (12). No overall structural differences are seen when the ferric and ferrous structures of the catalytic domain are compared (12). The

binding of BH4 causes small structural changes in the BH4 binding pocket, but again no large overall change in the structure is observed (12). It has not been possible to obtain structures with both BH4 and the natural amino acid, but instead, structures of the ternary complexes with BH4 and the substrate analogues 3-(2-thienyl)-L-alanine (THA) (PDB entries 1KW0 and 1MMK) and L-norleucine (NLE) (PDB entry 1MMT) are available (14, 15). Comparison of the structures PAH-Fe(II) · BH4 · THA and PAH-Fe(II) · BH4 · NLE to the PAH-Fe(II) · BH4 structure reveals large structural changes (14, 15). The structural changes are seen throughout the catalytic domain but most notably in the loop region containing residues 133-141, where Tyr138 of this loop moves from a surface position in the PAH-Fe(II) · BH4 structure (PDB entry 1J8U) to a partially buried position close to the active site in the PAH-Fe(II) · BH4 · THA structure (PDB entry 1MMK) (15). The corresponding loop in TH has recently been studied via a mutational study and fluorescence anisotropy (16, 17). These studies showed that the loop (residues 178-193 in TH) is similarly mobile (17) and that the side chains of the residues in the loop, especially Phe184 (corresponding to Tyr138 in PAH), are important in the formation of the proper amino acid substrate binding site (16). The fluorescence anisotropy study showed that the binding of BH4 to TH rather than the amino acid substrate binding caused the conformational change in the loop (17). TPH has not been structurally characterized to the extent of PAH and TH, and the only crystal structure of TPH is of the catalytic (c) domain of human TPH1 (cTPH1) with bound 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) and ferric iron (PDB entry 1MLW) (18). This structure is similar to the structures of the catalytic domain of PAH with either BH4 or BH2 bound (12, 19). In the human cTPH1 structure, Tyr125 (corresponding to Tyr138 in PAH) is positioned in a surface position, and the loop region corresponding to the flexible loop in TH and PAH is refined with high B-factors, indicating that this loop might be dynamic in a manner similar to that of TH and PAH. Studies of structural changes in TPH upon tryptophan and/or BH4 binding have not previously been performed. We have previously reported the expression, purification, and crystallization of chicken (Gallus gallus) cTPH1 (1-100/ 415-445) (20). We here present the crystal structure of the ferric form of chicken cTPH1 with bound tryptophan in the active site. This is the first structure of any aromatic amino acid hydroxylase with its natural amino acid substrate bound. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ultrapure glycerol was obtained from Invitrogen. The solution of 0.2 M imidazole malate (pH 8.5) and 22.5% PEG 10000 was from Molecular Dimensions. All chemicals used were analytical grade obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All solutions were prepared using 18.2 M cm water from a Milli-Q synthesis A10 Q-Gard system (Millipore). Chicken (G. gallus) cTPH1 (1-100/415-445)2 was expressed and purified as described previously (20).
Chicken TPH1 contains one more residue in the regulatory domain compared to human TPH1.

Crystallization and Data Collection. The initial crystallization trials have been described previously (20). Crystallization of chicken cTPH1 was conducted using the vapor diffusion method with sitting drops (2 + 2 µL in size). The reservoir solution contained 0.2 M imidazole malate (pH 8.5) and 22.5% PEG 10000. The chicken cTPH1 concentration in the protein solution was 2.8 mg/mL as determined by an 280 of 37820 M-1 cm-1 (HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer). The tray was placed on ice during drop setup and was subsequently stored at 4 °C. Crystals appeared after 6 months. The crystals were flash-cooled with the mother liquor and subsequently annealed by being transferred to 20% PEG 400, 0.2 M imidazole malate (pH 8.5), and 22.5% PEG 10000, and immediately the crystals were again flash-cooled. Data were collected on beamline ID 14-3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The data were processed in space group C2221 using XDS and X-scale (21) (see Table 1 for data statistics). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of the catalytic domain of human PAH (PDB entry 1PAH) (13) as a search model. This structure was chosen because it was crystallized

The level of sequence identity of the catalytic domains of human PAH and chicken TPH1 is 63%. Refinement. Refinement was carried out using REFMAC5 (22) in the CPP4 suite (23), and visual inspections and model rebuilding were carried out using WinCoot (24). The initial electron density was poor in large areas, but by rebuilding large parts of protein chain, we were able to obtain welldefined electron density for residues 105-411. The final model contains residues 105-411, one iron, one tryptophan molecule, one imidazole molecule, one sulfate ion (50% occupancy), two triethylene glycol molecules, and 219 water molecules. The following residues were refined with alternate conformations: Leu124, Ser261, Leu281, Ser349, Arg388, Val400, Ser408, and Val409. The model was refined to an R-factor of 0.182 and an Rfree of 0.226. The refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. The structure was validated using PROCHECK (25), and the Ramachandran plot shows 90% of the residues in the most favored region and 10% of the residues in the additionally allowed regions. Structure-based alignment was conducted using TOP (26). Graphics illustrating the protein structure were made using Pymol (27). Structural analysis for hinge regions was conducted using DynDom (28). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The crystal structure of chicken cTPH1 containing 307 residues (105-411), one iron, one L-tryptophan molecule, and one imidazole molecule was determined to 1.9 Å resolution. This is the first crystal structure of any aromatic amino acid hydroxylase with its natural amino acid substrate bound in the active site. The chicken cTPH1 used for crystallization contains residues 101-414, but there was no visible electron density for residues 101-104 or 412-414. The overall structure of chicken cTPH1 is similar to that of the catalytic domain of the other aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, i.e., PAH and TH (13, 29). The chicken cTPH1 structure resembles the structure of PAH with bound THA and BH4 (PDB entry 1MMK) (15) more than the structure of human cTPH1 (PDB entry 1MLW) with root-mean-square deviations for the CR atoms of 0.90 and 1.47 Å, respectively. The structural alignment of the chicken cTPH1 structure with the human cTPH1 structure is shown in Figure 1. Crystallization Time. The crystallization time for the chicken cTPH1 crystals was 3-6 months. When the chicken cTPH1 drops were set up, strong precipitation was always observed. While the imidazole bound in the active site originated from the crystallization solution, the tryptophan also bound in the active site was not added to the purification or crystallization solutions. Most likely, tryptophan has been bound in the active site of chicken cTPH1 from the time of expression in the Escherichia coli cells. The tryptophan could also have been formed from proteolytic degradation of chicken cTPH1 molecules. This could explain the very long crystallization time, but since only two tryptophans are present in chicken cTPH1, both are visible in the structure, and none of these are found in the termini, this is not the likely source of the tryptophan. Tryptophan Binding. The electron density for the substrate tryptophan is well-defined, and the average B-factor of the

FIGURE 1: Structural alignment of chicken cTPH1 (blue) and human cTPH1 (red, PDB entry 1MLW) (18) with the irons shown as spheres. Large structural differences are seen throughout the structure, most clearly in the loops above the active site. The expression construct of chicken cTPH1 is elongated in the Cterminus compared to the human cTPH1 construct that was used (18), and this C-terminal part is visible in the chicken cTPH1 structure.

FIGURE 2: Schematic view of the tryptophan substrate interactions in chicken cTPH1. Hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines, and the filled gray circles represent water molecules. Semicircled residues have hydrophobic interactions with the tryptophan. For residues which are not conserved in PAH and TH, the corresponding residue is shown.

tryptophan is 9.9 Å2. The interactions between the tryptophan and chicken cTPH1 are shown in Figure 2. The hydrophobic part of the tryptophan binding pocket is lined with the side chains of Tyr236, Thr266, Pro269 (ring stacking), His273, Phe314, Phe319, and Ile367 and with the backbone of Pro267, Glu268, and Gly334. The polar interactions of the tryptophan are between Thr266 N and Trp O1 (3.1 Å), Thr266 O and Trp N (2.9 Å), and Ile367 O and Trp N1 (2.8 Å) and with side chains Arg258 N1 and Trp O1 (3.3 Å), Arg258 N2 and Trp O2 (2.8 Å), and Ser337 O and Trp O2 (2.6 Å).

Windahl et al. in PAH and TH, the preference for tryptophan over phenylalanine was weakened (31, 32). The Phe314 instead of a tryptophan results in a larger binding cavity for the tryptophan substrate which in part governs the substrate specificity. The residues corresponding to Ile367 are a valine in PAH and Asp425 in TH. Asp425 in TH is known to be important for the substrate specificity of TH, possibly by hydrogen bonding to the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine substrate to place it in the proper position for hydroxylation (33). In TPH, Ile367 forms part of the hydrophobic binding pocket and a charged/polar residue, such as aspartate, at this position may significantly disturb tryptophan binding. Imidazole Binding. Structural alignment of the iron sites of human cTPH1-Fe(III) · BH2 and chicken cTPH1-Fe(III) · Trp shows that the imidazole binds between the sites where the water molecules are bound in the human cTPH1 structure, with the imidazole pointing in the same direction as the position of BH2 in the human cTPH1 structure. In the PAHFe(II) · BH4 · THA structure, BH4 is bound closer to the iron, and a structural alignment of the iron site with the chicken cTPH1 structure (see Figure 4) shows that the BH4 is located quite close to the position of imidazole in the chicken cTPH1 structure. The imidazole does not interact directly with the protein chain but interacts through two bridging water molecules with Gly235 O, Leu237 N, His252 O, and Glu274 O1, as shown in Figure 5. The BH2 in human cTPH1 interacts directly with Leu236 N, Leu236 O, and Gly234 O and through bridging water molecules with His251 O, Glu273 O1, and Glu273 O2. BH2 in human cTPH1 furthermore interacts through bridging water molecules with Glu317 and the iron. Since some of the hydrogen bonds in human cTPH1 · BH2 are still preserved by the imidazole in the chicken cTPH1 structure, the imidazole might mimic the BH4/BH2 binding in the active site. Conformational Changes upon Tryptophan Binding. The binding of tryptophan and imidazole causes the chicken cTPH1 to change conformation to a more closed and compact structure compared to the human cTPH1 structure (see Figure 1). This gives a unique opportunity to investigate changes in TPH1 upon substrate binding. In a comparison of the structure to that of human cTPH1 · BH2, four hinge regions were identified: residues 121-134, 148 and 149, 162 and 163, and 168 and 169. Comparison of the crystal structures of PAH revealed large movement in the loop region of residues 131-155 upon binding of THA or NLE to the PAHFe(II) · BH4 complex (12, 14, 15). Similarly, the largest differences between the structure of human cTPH1Fe(III) · BH2 and chicken cTPH1-Fe(III) · Trp are seen in the loop region of Leu124-Asp139 which moves toward the loop of Ile367-Thr369. The structural alignment of human cTPH1-Fe(III) · BH2 and chicken cTPH1-Fe(III) · Trp structures in Figure 6 illustrates this movement. The two loops close around the active site, reducing the distances between Leu130 CR and Thr368 CR from 17.3 Å in human cTPH1Fe(III) · BH2 to 7.1 Å in chicken cTPH1-Fe(III) · Trp. Tyr126 corresponds to Tyr138 in PAH, and crystal structures of PAH have shown that this tyrosine changes from a surface position to a buried position close to the active site upon binding of the substrate analogue THA or NLE (12, 14, 15). Tyr126 of chicken cTPH1 corresponds to Phe184 in TH. The movement of this phenylalanine residue and the flexibility of the loop in TH have been studied, and

The distance from tryptophan C 3 to the iron (red line) is 3.9 Å. Water molecules are shown as red spheres. Imidazole is abbreviated Im.

water8 are hydrogen bonded to Trp N (3.0 and 2.7 Å, respectively). Water2 also hydrogen bonds to Ile367 O (3.0 Å), Tyr265 O (2.8 Å), and water20 (2.7 Å), and water8 also hydrogen bonds to Glu341 O1 (2.8 Å) and Gly334 O (2.9 Å). The distance between tryptophan C 3 that is hydroxylated and the iron is 3.9 Å (see Figure 3). The angle between the tryptophan plane and iron is 141° (measured Fe-C 3-C2 angle). The structure of the catalytic domain of PAH with the substrate analogue THA has been determined (PDB entry 1MMK) (15). The binding of THA in PAH is similar to that of tryptophan in chicken cTPH1 with regard to the polar interactions, but the ring system of THA stacks onto the imidazole group of His285 (14) while the tryptophan is positioned sideways with respect to the corresponding His273 (see Figure 4). Instead, tryptophan stacks on Pro269, yielding an angle between the tryptophan plane and the iron of 141° rather than the angle of 101° between the THA ring and the iron (Fe-C2-C ) (15). Substrate Specificity. The substrate specificity in the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases must be controlled through the interactions of the side chain of the amino acid substrate. The side chain of the tryptophan substrate is bound in a hydrophobic pocket lined by residues Tyr236, Thr266, Pro267, Glu268, Pro269, His273, Phe314, Phe319, and Ile367 (see Figures 2 and 3). Of these, Tyr236, Phe314, and Ile367 are not conserved in PAH and TH and Thr266 is not conserved in TH. The role of Tyr236 in substrate binding has previously been studied (30). Variants Y236A and Y236L had decreased levels of substrate inhibition and an increased apparent Km,tryptophan. In the human cTPH1 · BH2 structure, Tyr236 is furthermore involved in the BH2 binding, where the BH2 is sandwiched between Tyr236 and Phe242 (18). The structure here confirms that Tyr236 is also involved in tryptophan binding (see Figure 3). Phe314 has previously been identified as having an important role in the substrate specificity of TPH (31, 32). With a change from Phe314 to a tryptophan, which is seen

The THA packs against the closest iron coordinating histidine, while the substrate tryptophan is positioned sideways with respect to this histidine.

a large movement is detected upon binding of BH4 (17). The structural alignment of PAH-Fe(II) · BH4 · THA, human cTPH1Fe(III) · BH2, and chicken cTPH1-Fe(III) · Trp structures in Figure 7 shows that the loop of residues Asp117-Asp139 has quite different conformations. In chicken cTPH1, Tyr126 has not moved to a buried position, but the loop has made an extra turn, still keeping Tyr126 on the surface where it is packed against Phe137 and with a triethylene glycol molecule nearby (4 Å). Tyr126 cannot move to the position which is seen for the corresponding Tyr in PAH-Fe(II) · BH4 · THA (PDB entry 1MMK) (15) since it would then clash with Tyr236 and Ile367.

Tyr126 is solvent-exposed in chicken cTPH1 while it is positioned in the interior of PAH close to the iron.

The kinetic mechanism of PAH and TH is a sequential mechanism, and the order of substrate binding is generally believed to be that BH4 binds as the first substrate with the aromatic amino acid as the second or third (34, 35). None

of the structures of PAH, TH, and TPH contain the aromatic amino acid substrate, while several structures have BH4 or the oxidized analogue BH2 bound. This fact supports BH4 as the first substrate to bind. The structures of PAH show that the binding of the BH4 or BH2 cosubstrate does not result in any major structural changes (14). We observe large structural changes upon binding of tryptophan without BH4 or BH2 bound, but with imidazole bound. This structure therefore raises the question of whether it is the aromatic amino acid binding or the combination of BH4 and the aromatic amino acid that causes the conformational change. Two different scenarios can be envisioned. (1) The binding of tryptophan alone to TPH causes the structural changes observed in the present structure compared to the human cTPH1-Fe(III) · BH2 structure. In this conformation, the tryptophan is trapped inside TPH, and this can explain how tryptophan is present in the structure even though it was not added during purification or crystallization. The imidazole was present in the crystallization solution (0.2 M) and has been able to access the active site of the "closed" structure. (2) The combination of tryptophan and imidazole causes the structural changes. The tryptophan has been bound in TPH in an open structure. Upon addition of imidazole, the closed structure forms. As shown in Figure 8, the imidazole and a water molecule satisfy four of the hydrogen bonds seen in the human cTPH1-Fe(III) · BH2 structure, and it may be that this is enough to mimic the binding of BH2 or BH4 to TPH. As mentioned above, BH4 is believed to be the first substrate to bind in the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. If this is the case and tryptophan accidently binds as the first substrate and the scenario where tryptophan alone is responsible for the structural change is true, the binding of BH4 will be more difficult because the structure is closed. The closed TPH-Fe(III) · Trp structure would then be a nonproductive complex which gives a structural explanation for the observed tryptophan substrate inhibition (18, 20, 36) with a Ki,tryptophan of 163 ( 24 µM for chicken cTPH1 (20). Substrate inhibition is also observed for TH, and Fitzpatrick has proposed the equivalent TH · Tyr forms a dead-end complex (35). Enzyme kinetics studies will be undertaken to determine the substrate binding order of TPH and the influence of imidazole on the enzyme kinetics. Additionally, crystallization without the imidazole will be used to attempt to clarify whether the imidazole has an effect on the structure. Coordination of the Iron. The iron is coordinated by His273, His278, and Glu318. The coordination is shown in Figure 8A, and the bond lengths in chicken cTPH1-

Fe(III) · Trp and human cTPH1-Fe(III) · BH2 are summarized in Table 2 (and bond angles in Table S1 of the Supporting Information). The coordination by Glu318 is partially bidentate with bond lengths of 2.1 and 2.7 Å. Furthermore, an imidazole is coordinated to the iron with a bond length of 1.9 Å. The iron coordination is best described as a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination. No water molecules are coordinated to iron. The coordination of the iron in chicken cTPH1-Fe(III) · Trp is quite different from the octahedral iron coordination seen in the human cTPH1-Fe(III) · BH2 structure (18) (see Figure 8B). The iron in chicken cTPH1 is coordinated by the common 2-histidine-1-carboxylate facial triad motif seen in many dioxygen activating non-heme iron enzymes (11). The resting state in these enzymes has one face of the octahedral iron center coordinated by two histidines and one carboxylate and three water molecules on the opposite face. Such a resting state is seen for the octahedral iron center of human cTPH1Fe(III) · BH2 (Figure 8B). When substrate binds, one or two water molecules are usually released, leading to a more open five-coordinate iron site with an open site for O2 (11). No water molecules are coordinated to the iron in chicken cTPH1, but instead, one imidazole is coordinated and the glutamate has a partial bidentate coordination. This fivecoordinate iron therefore has an open site for O2. A similar open iron coordination is seen in PAH-Fe(II) · BH4 · THA (PDB entry 1MMK), where the iron is coordinated by only the three coordinating residues, but with some electron density present close to the iron which could be a water molecule with low occupancy (15). In the PAHFe(II) · BH4 · NLE structure (PDB entry 1MMT) where THA is replaced with NLE, one water molecule is coordinated to the iron and still has an open site for O2 (15). It is likely that the overall structural changes that occur upon substrate analogue binding reduce the affinity of the iron for water, thus yielding an open coordination site. The oxidation state of the iron may also influence the iron coordination. The

iron is presumed to be in the ferric form, since the gel filtration and crystallization have been conducted in an aerobic atmosphere, and aerobic isolation of TH and PAH has resulted in the ferric form of the enzymes (37, 38). However, we have not made attempts to determine the oxidation state of the iron before or after the X-ray data collection. Residues Arg396 and Pro404. The mutation corresponding to the R441H variant in human TPH2 is believed to be correlated with depression (39). Arg441 in human TPH2 corresponds to Arg396 in chicken TPH1. The Arg396 side chain makes hydrogen bonds to Leu296 O (2.7 Å), Leu299 O (3.0 Å), and Phe398 O (3.2 Å) (see Figure 9), and these hydrogen bonds are believed to be important in tying the C-terminal -sheet to the rest of the catalytic domain (40). A mutation that changes Pro449 to arginine in human TPH2 (corresponds to Pro404 in chicken TPH1) has also been identified (4) and is believed to be important for the stability and catalytic activity of TPH (39, 41, 42). Structures of the catalytic and tetramerization domains of TH and PAH show that the C-terminal -sheet is the link between the catalytic domainandtheR-helixresponsibleforthetetramerization(29,40). Pro404 in chicken TPH1 may have an important role in the formation of the turn of the C-terminal -sheet, and mutations of this residue might lead to increased flexibility in the -sheet formation, which destabilizes the tetramer. CONCLUSION In summary, the crystal structure of chicken cTPH1 has been determined to 1.9 Å resolution. The tryptophan substrate is bound close to the iron in a binding pocket distinct from the BH4 binding pocket. The hydrophobic part of the tryptophan binding pocket is lined by residues Tyr236, Thr266, Pro269, His273, Phe314, Phe319, and Ile367, while the polar interactions of the tryptophan are with Thr266, Ile367, and Ser337 and a salt bridge to Arg258. The overall structure is more compact with two loops closing around the active site, when compared to the structure of human cTPH1.
