ABSTRACT The three-dimensional structure of Rv2607, a putative pyridoxine 5 -phosphate oxidase (PNPOx) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has been determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.5 Å resolution. Rv2607 has a core domain similar to known PNPOx structures with a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor. Electron density for two FMN at the dimer interface is weak despite the bright yellow color of the protein solution and crystal. The shape and size of the putative binding pocket is markedly different from that of members of the PNPOx family, which may indicate some significant changes in the FMN binding mode of this protein relative to members of the family.

Here, we report the 2.5 Å solution structure of Rv2607, a 224 amino-acid protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Sequence and structural alignments reveal some significant homology with enzymes from the PNPOx family. Two monomers related by a two-fold axis interact extensively to form a dimer with two clefts located at the dimer interface. Despite the yellow color of the protein solution and crystal, electron density in the predicted FMN binding sites is weak. Superimposition of the active site cavity of Rv2607 with PNPOx homologues indicates that the conserved Gln155 and Ser156 found in homologues cannot interact with FMN. In addition, the replacement of an arginine with an alanine (Ala97) in Rv2607 causes the bottom of the funnel-like cavity to be open with the phosphate moiety of FMN potentially exposed to solvent. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and Expression A 0.67 kbp DNA fragment containing the Mtb Rv2607 gene was amplified by conventional PCR from Mtb H37Rv genomic DNA as the template, using 5 -AGATATACATATGGACGATGACGCCCAAATGGTCGCG-3 , and 5 -AATTCGGATCCGGGTTGCAACCGTTCCAGCCGGCC-3 . The bases in bold correspond to the NdeI and BamHI sites, respectively. The amplified DNA fragment was digested and subcloned into a modified pET28b vector which provided an N-terminal six-His tag and thrombin

In prokaryotic organisms, PNPOx is involved in the terminal step of the de novo biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5 phosphate (PLP), while in eukaryotic cells, it is a part of a salvage pathway for the reutilization of the coenzyme. PNPOx has been purified and characterized from rabbit liver,3 from the brains of pig,4,5 rat,6 and sheep,4 ­ 8 and from E. coli.1,9 In mammals, PNPOx is present in liver, brain, and kidney. It also exists in the heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and bone marrow with relatively lower activities.10

cleavage site upstream of the NdeI site. The expressed protein has the N-terminal extension MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH and an additional GS tag at the C-terminus. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the PNPOx-modified pET28b/6HIS vector and grown to exponential phase at 37°C in 3 mL of Luria­Bertani broth containing 30 g/mL kanamycin. The seed culture was transferred to 500 mL terrific broth and expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-thio- -D-galactoside at an OD600 of approximately 0.5. Growth was continued at 20°C for approximately 20 h until the OD600 reached approximately 15 (as measured from dilutions). The cells were harvested and stored at 80°C. Protein Purification The cell pellets were lysed by sonication in 10 mL of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) per gram of cells for 10 min in 30-s pulses at 10°C. After ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 38,000 rpm, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 m pore membrane and loaded on a 5 mL Talon superflow affinity column (Clontech) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with 50 mL buffer A, the His-tagged PNPOx was eluted from the cobalt affinity column using buffer B (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). The eluent was dialyzed against buffer C (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM ­mercaptoethanol) and purified by gel filtration on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using buffer C for equilibration and elution. The peak fractions (monitored at OD280) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the pooled protein fractions were concentrated to 27.5 mg/mL using a Centriprep YM-3 (Millipore). The protein was 95% pure, as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems). Spectroscopic Measurements FMN (98% pure) and FAD (96% pure) were purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions (35 mM and 500 M) of both FMN and FAD were prepared in sterilized water. For absorption measurements, 35 mM stock solutions of FMN and FAD were each diluted to 50 M in buffer A. Rv2607 concentration was determined with the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with BSA as the standard11 and diluted to 25 M in buffer A. The flavin coenzyme was released by boiling 1 mL of the 25 M Rv2607 solution for 7 min. The sample was then rapidly chilled on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. The supernatant was equilibrated at room temperature before absorption measurements. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer using 1-cm light path cells. For fluorescence experiments, 500 M stock solutions of FMN and FAD were each diluted to 5 M in both buffers A and D (50 mM KH2PO4 pH 3.0, 1 M KBr). The flavin coenzyme supernatant was diluted 1:7.5 in the same buffers. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured

using a PerkinElmer LS-50B spectrofluorometer with excitation at 450 nm. The emission bandwidths were set to 5 nm. Crystallization and Data Collection Crystals were grown in 96-well Greiner plates from sitting drops consisting of 2 L protein stock solution mixed with 2 L well solution at 22°C. Initial crystallization conditions were obtained by random screening using CRYSTOOL.12 Among 228 conditions tested, 0.1 M Tris/ maleate pH 6.5, 14.2% polyethylene glycol 10000, and 0.8% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide yielded diffraction-quality crystals. A rod-shaped crystal of approximately 200 m 20 m 20 m in size was harvested with a Hampton cryoloop and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The cryopin was robotically mounted with the Advanced Light Source robotic system on beamline 5.0.1.13 Data to 2.3 Å were collected at an X-ray wavelength of 1.0 Å. The diffraction images revealed a pattern of two overlapping lattices. Reflection intensities were successfully processed using MOSFLM.14 The CCP4 suite of programs15 was used to merge and scale these intensities and to compute the structure-factor amplitudes. The crystal belongs to space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a 69.61 Å, b 91.11 Å, c 92.99 Å. Molecular Replacement, Model Building, and Refinement The initial phases were obtained with molecular replacement using the program AMoRe.16 The E. coli PNPOx17 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 1G79] was used as search model. The phases were subsequently improved by density modification and two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging with the program RESOLVE.18 Initial model building was carried out with the RESOLVE-REFMAC19 auto-rebuilding procedure20 provided in the RESOLVE package. Three hundred fifty-six out of the 448 expected residues from the dimer were built this way and yielded an Rvalue/Rfree of 0.316/0.356 to dmin 2.5 Å. The model was completed manually by using the program TURBO-FRODO (http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/rubrique113.html) and refined with the program CNS.21 Refinement included simulated annealing with torsion angle dynamics, energy minimization, and individual B-factor refinement. No sigma cut-off was applied. The final model was refined in REFMAC519 using one TLS group per monomer. The crystallographic Rvalue and Rfree values were 0.209 and 0.260, respectively (Table I). All residues are in the allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot and 91% of them have the most-favored backbone ( , values, as defined by PROCHECK22). The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB (accession code: 2A2J).

statistics are summarized in Table I. The current model consists of 203 amino-acid residues comprising residues 24 to 224 plus residues Gly225 and Ser226 from an engineered BamHI restriction site (see the Materials and Methods section), and 75 water molecules. The amino-terminal 23 amino-acid residues are not seen in the electron density map and are presumed to be disordered. Arg218 has been replaced by an Ala because it is missing side-chain electron density. One of two Cys residues, Cys29, could be modeled as S,S-(2-hydroxyethyl)-thiocysteine (CME), as confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). CME may result from modification by -mercaptoethanol present in the purification buffer. The core of the protein includes a nine-stranded -barrel, capped at both ends by helices 1 and 2 [Fig. 1(A)]. A smaller domain composed of helices 3, 4, and 5 is located between strands 5 and 6 where it packs adjacent to the -barrel. The overall structure is very similar to enzymes from the pyridoxine 5 -phosphate oxidase (PNPOx) family. Using DALI,23 the closest structural homologue originates from E. coli (PDB code: 1G79) with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 1.3 Å among 194 C atoms and 41% identity [Fig. 1(B)]. As shown in Figure 1, strand 6 in the E. coli,24 S. cerevisiae (PDB code: 1CI0), and human25 enzymes becomes divided into two strands, 6 and 7, in the Mtb structure. Dimeric Structure Analytical gel filtration chromatography showed that Rv2607 migrates predominantly with a mobility corre-

sponding to a molecular mass of 54 kDa, under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. This is consistent with a dimer of the protein (50 kDa). The asymmetric unit of the Rv2607 crystal structure also contains two molecules related by a two-fold axis to form a dimer (Fig. 2). The dimer adopts an ellipsoidal shape with overall dimensions: 53 Å 83 Å 47 Å. The dimeric interface, with the two monomers tightly wrapped around each other, buries a total of 4818 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface per molecule, or about 21% of the total subunit surface. This value is comparable to PNPOx structural homologues.24 Main contributors to the dimer interface can be divided into three groups with locations similar to PNPOx homologues (Fig. 2, in red and black). The first group involves the amino-acid residue side chains of Lys26, Glu59, Thr75 and Ser77, Ser109, Thr111, Tyr115, and Gln120, which interact across the two-fold axis. The salt bridge between Lys26 and Glu59 is unique to the Mtb protein. Each side-chain OH of Thr75 and Ser77 makes hydrogen bond contacts to facing residue pairs Ser109/ Thr111 and Tyr115/Gln120, respectively. Only Ser109 and Gln120 are strictly conserved among the E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and human PNPOx. In the E. coli structure, Ser109 is one of the two polar residues responsible for extensive hydrogen-bond interactions with the symmetry-related monomer. The second and third groups of residues contributing to the dimer interface are related by the two-fold axis and located at the edges of the dimer interface (Fig. 2, in red and black). One residue, Arg162, is strictly conserved in all three PNPOx homologues. One of its side-chain NH can potentially donate a hydrogen bond either to the main-chain CO of Met208 or the side-chain oxygens of Asp31 and Asn210. Interestingly, a similar network of interactions also exists in the E. coli oxidase despite the non-conservation of residues Met and Asn at corresponding positions [Fig. 1(C)]. In addition, residues Gly225 and Ser226 introduced by the engineered BamHI restriction site, also participate in stabilizing the dimer interface by making polar interactions with Ala97 and Ser153 from the symmetry-related monomer. Identification of the Coenzyme The absorption spectrum of the yellow colored protein solution exhibits two bands at 380 and 450 nm [Fig. 3(A)] typical for an oxidized flavoprotein.26 Pure flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and the coenzyme released after boiling of the protein solution (see the Materials and Methods section) both show an absorption maximum at 445 nm, whereas the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) absorption band is centered at 450 nm. A similar 5 nm shift around 450 nm between the bound and unbound states of FMN has been previously documented for PNP/PMP oxidases.9 We also noticed a change in the 380 nm region, where the absorption profile of the extracted FMN solution exhibits a broad plateau rather than a peak [Fig. 3(A)]. On the other hand, boiling FMN or FAD produced no observable changes in the absorption profiles (data not shown).

(B) Corresponding emission spectra as in (A) with the exception of the Rv2607 holoenzyme. Emission spectra measured for FMN (5), FAD (6), and the released coenzyme (7) in 50 mM KH2PO4 pH 3.0.

To unambiguously confirm the presence of FMN as the Rv2607 cofactor, we measured the emission spectra at pH 8.0 and pH 3.0 [Fig. 3(B)]. The fluorescence intensity of the released coenzyme and pure FMN solution slightly decreases at acidic pH, whereas the fluorescence intensity of FAD increases by more than 400%. Another approach to demonstrate that the bound coenzyme was FMN and not FAD required preparing the apoenzyme by extensive dialysis against 50 mM KH2PO4 pH 4.0, 1 M KBr, as previously described. Unfortunately, we were unable to recover the colorless protein as it precipitated above pH 5.0. Active Site Structure There are two symmetry-related clefts at the dimer interface, whose locations are similar to those described for PNPOx homologues (Fig. 2). Structural studies of PNPOx homologues have shown that the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) occupies both clefts and is non-covalently bound to the dimer. Despite some weak electron density around the isoalloxazine, ribityl hydroxyl, and phosphate moieties [Fig. 4(A), in red], we were not able to clearly identify the position of the FMN in the Rv2607 active site pocket. Superimposition of Rv2607 and PNPOx homologues in the vicinity of the active site led to two important findings. First, the seven-residue loop located between helices 4 and 5 adopts a different conformation in Rv2607 than in homologues [Fig. 4(B)]. In the E. coli PNPOx, as well as for the S. cerevisiae and human

PNPOxs, the strictly conserved amino-acid residues Gln146 and Ser147 [Fig. 1(C)] are involved in extensive hydrogen-bond interactions with FMN. In our structure, the C of Gln155 and Ser156 are shifted by 4.33 Å and 4.90 Å relative to the E. coli oxidase (PDB code: 1DNL), respectively, and their side-chains point away from the active site [Fig. 4(B)]. Second, the alanine at position 97 in the Mtb protein is an arginine in all three structural homologues. In the E. coli structure, the side-chain of the arginine (Arg88) packs against the Glu189 sidechain from the neighboring monomer, at the bottom of the funnel-like cavity. In the S. cerevisiae and human structures, the same arginine makes electrostatic contacts with a different glutamate at positions 122 and 143, respectively. By replacing the arginine with an alanine in the Mtb protein, the bottom of the funnel-like cavity is no longer closed and the FMN phosphate moiety that points downward into the cavity bottom of the PNPOx homologues would become solvent-exposed. As a consequence of these two differences, the shape and cavity volume were found to be different between Rv2607 and the PNPOx homologues. Using CASTp,27 the cavity volume of Rv2607 is estimated to be 2230 Å3, whereas that of E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and human PNPOxs are 1581 Å3, 1715 Å3, and 1411 Å3, respectively. Residues important for pyridoxal 5 -phosphate (PLP) binding have been identified in the E. coli17 and human25 enzymes. Except for Ala146, which is a Ser in these two homologues, all other residues are conserved in Rv2607 [Fig. 1(C), in blue and green triangles]. A structural superimposition between Rv2607 and the E. coli oxidase in complex with PLP (PDB code: 1G79) indicates a rmsd of 0.8 Å among 15 C atoms in the PLP binding region (residues 79 ­ 81, 138 ­146, 207­209). Except for Tyr138 [Fig. 4(C)], the side-chain orientations of the conserved residues are closely similar to the E. coli enzyme. Similarity to Phenazine Biosynthesis Enzyme PhzG Despite some strong sequence and structural similarities between Rv2607 and members of the PNPOx family, automated superposition of our protein structure using DALI23 also revealed significant similarities with the flavin-dependent oxidase PhzG from P. aeruginosa (PDB code: 1T9M) and P. fluorescens (PDB code: 1TY9).28 Indeed, 190 and 195 C atoms of Rv2607 could be superimposed onto the P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens structures with a rmsd of 2 Å. PhzG catalyzes the final oxidation/aromatization step in the conversion of 2,3dihydro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (DHHA) to phenazine1-carboxylic acid (PCA).29 Positively charged residues interacting with the phosphate moiety of PLP in PNPOxs are not conserved in PhzG, consistent with the inability of PhzG to bind and oxidize PNPOx substrates.28 The same situation might apply to the phosphate moiety of FMN, which is stabilized by conserved key residues Arg67, Arg88, Lys89, and Arg201 in the E. coli oxidase. In Rv2607, on the other hand, Arg88 becomes Ala97 and may have a negative effect on the
