The naturally occurring serine protease inhibitor, chymostatin, forms a hemiacetal adduct with the catalytic Ser195 residue of Streptomyces griseus protease A. Restrained parameter least-squares refinement of this complex to 1.8 A resolution has produced an R index of 0.123 for the 11,755 observed reflections. The refined distance of the carbonyl carbon atom of the aldehyde to Ov of Ser195 is 1.62 A. Both the R and S configurations of the hemiacetal occur in equal populations, with the end result resembling the expected configuration for a covalent tetrahedral product intermediate of a true substrate. This study strengthens the concept that serine proteases stabilize a covalent, tetrahedrally co-ordinated species and elaborates those features of the enzyme responsible for this effect. We propose that a major driving force for the hydrolysis of peptide bonds by serine proteases is the non-planar distortion of the scissile bond by the enzyme, which thereby lowers the activation energy barrier to hydrolysis by eliminating the resonance stabilization energy of the peptide bond.

1. Introduction
Chymostatin is a small peptide inhibitor produced by a number of species of Streptomyces (Umezawa et al., 1970). Its inhibitory activity is maximally directed towards serine proteases exhibiting chymotryptic-like cleavage specificity (Umezawa, 1976, 1977: Nishikata, 1983). The rather unusual chemical structure of chymostatin (Tatsuta rf al.. 1973) is illustrated in Figure 1 (a) and has been confirmed using crystallographic techniques (Delbaere & Brayer. 1980). Novel functional features of chymostatin include an aldehyde function incorporated into the C-terminal phenylalaninyl residue, a cyclized-arginine residue (2-(2iminohexahydro-(4s)pyrimidyl)(S)-glycine) and a ureido moiet)y which reverses the C + N direction of the polypeptide chain. When isolated, this inhibitor is a mixture of three components, each differing as to the identity of tfhe amino acid adjacent to the cyclized-argmme residue. Chymostatin A (pictured in Fig. 1(a)) has a leucine residue; chymostatin B, a valine residue; and chymostatin C has an isoleucine residue at this position. The predominant species ( -SO:,,,) is chymostatin A (analysis by Protein Research Foundation, Osaka, Japan). 89

Recently, chymostatin and other related aldehyde-containing prot'ease inhibitors have enjoyed widespread use in the study of such diverse cellular functions as aggregation (Lane et al., 1980) and growth and differentiation (Libby & Goldberg, 1980). All of t,hese processes are closely linked to

Replacement of the aldehyde function with an alcohol or acid group leads to a loss of inhibitor activity for peptide aldehydes (Umezawa, 1977; Thompson & Bauer, 1979). A high resolution, three-dimensional crystallographic study of pept'ide aldehyde complexation has been completed using the synthetic peptide of Figure 1 (b) and SGPAt (James et aE., 1980). This study confirmed the presence of a tetrahedral hemiacetal and the formation of a covalent bond to the catalytic serine of SGPA. An additional medium resolut,ion analysis ut'ilizing chymost'atin bound to the same serine protease also confirmed the general nature of hemiacetal formation (Delbaere & Brayer, 1980). Nevertheless, several pertinent features of complexation were found to be significantly different upon comparison of the binding modes of the synthet#ic pept'ide aldehyde and chymostatin to SGPA. Most importantly. the cat,alytic histidine residue is expelled into solvent in aldehyde case, whereas in the the synthetic chymostatin complex this residue remains in t,he native enzyme position. Furthermore, the overall mode of inhibitor amino acid residues binding varied markedly. In order to shed some light on these differential effects, we have chosen to pursue and obtain the high resolution structure of the chymostatin---SGPA using X-ray crystallographic and complex restrained parameter least-squares techniques. In addition, SGPA shows strong structural homology to the mammalian pancreatic serine proteases (James et al., 1978; Brayer et aZ.. 19786; Delbaere et u,l.. 1979) and therefore the results obtained should be relevant t,o other members of this enzyme family.

intrinsic proteolytic activity. Chymostatin is an ideal candidate for such studies since its inhibitory act,ivity is directed towards proteases of defined lytic specificity, and it is remarkably resistant to degradation as a consequence of its rather unique chemical structure. Considerable interest has been generated concerning the possible therapeutic value of chymostatin as an inhibitor of disease-related proteases. For example, leucocyte proteases play a primary role in the inflammatory tissue injury that occurs in pulmonary emphysema and certain joint diseases has been shown (Janoff, 1972, 1975). Chymostatin t'o prevent tissue degradation even when endogenous protease inhibitors such as alphaiantitrypsin, which might be expected to prevent such proteolytic attack, are largely ineffective (Feinstein et al., 1976). Chymostatin has also been shown to be a potent inhibitor of protein degradation in other intact cells (Grinde & Jahnsen, 1982; Bates et al.. 1982). In addition, this inhibitor also appears to have been non-toxic to all organisms thus far investigated. Chymostatin, therefore, has great therapeutic potential in being specifically directed against cells that are injured or are abnormally releasing destructive otherwise proteases. A number of lines of evidence suggest chymostatin is an excellent inhibitor of serine proteases by virt,ue of its aldehyde function and this group's ability to form a tetrahedral hemiacetal adduct with the catalytic serine residue of these enzymes (Brayer et al.. 1979; Delbaere & Brayer, 1980). Several other peptide aldehyde analogs of good substrates have been shown to be competitive inhibitors of serine proteases (Ito et al., 1972: Thompson, 1973; Breaux & Bender, 1975; Hunkapillar et al., 1975; Chen et al., 1979; Brayer et aZ., 1979). The tetrahedral hemiacetal formed is believed to be similar to tetrahedral intermediates generated during the catalytic proteolysis of peptide bonds (Thompson, 1973; Kuramochi et al., 1979; Thompson & Bauer, 1979; Lewis & Wolfenden, 1977). Since the catalytic activity of enzymes is a consequence of their ability to exhibit enhanced affinities for the activated intermediates of substrates, one would anticipate that these same enzymes would manifest very strong binding to stable inhibitors that resemble such intermediates in structure (Wolfenden, 1972; Lienhard, 1973; & Wolfenden 1980). This is indeed Andersson observed in both synthetically prepared peptide aldehydes and also naturally occurring inhibitors, such as chymostatin. The chemical structure of one such synthet,ically prepared peptidc aldehyde is illustrated in Figure l(b). The kinetic properties of this pept,ide have been thoroughly examined. and the Ki is 5.0 x 10V8 M for inhibition of Streptomyces griseus protease A. This aldehyde binds approximately

2. Materials and Methods
SGPA was purified from Pronase (grade W, (Mbiochern lot 801930) by t,he technique of Jurasek et al. (1971). Chymostatin was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (lot 230715). Tetragonal crystals of SGPA were grown as described by Brayer et al. (1978a) and chymostatin was into an SPGA crystal in 1.5 M-KaH,PCl, at diffused pH 4.1 as described by Delbaere & Brayer (1980). Diffraction data to 18 A d spacing were collected on a Picker FACS-I diffractometer and the crystal data are given in Table 1. The restrained parameter 1eastMquare refinement program package of Hendrickson h Konnert computer at the (1980) was used on the DEC2060 University of Saskatchewan. The starting model for SGPA was that of the native enzyme at 1.8 A resolution as described bv James et al. (1980). The chymostatin starting co-ordinates were those from the 2.8 A study (Delbaere & Brayer. 1980); all atoms were initially assigned occupancy values of 1.0. Eighteen solvent molecules from the native SGPA crystal structure within 2.5 L% of the chymostatin moiety were deleted from t)he list of atoms. leaving 182 solvent molecules in the initial SGPA/chymostatin model. Initially, the aldehyde oxygen atom of chymostatin was restrained to I.25 L% from the C-terminal carbon atom, as had been done previously for

The initial R factor (R = c[]F,] -lF,]]/c]F,]) was 0.167. After 16 cycles of refinement the R value dropped to 0.131. At this point atoms of the inhibitor had negligible shifts in orcupancy. suggesting the inhibitor was present at full occupancy. A difference map and a map were then calculated. Examination of 2]F,]-IF,] these maps as well as the refined occupancies and temperature factors of solvent molecules led to the adjustments: 3 of the initial water following molecules were removed and 39 new water molecules were added to give a total of 218 solvent molecules. These additional molecules were initially assigned occupancies of 0.5 and H factors of 30 x2. One of these was positioned within a covalent, bond dist,ance of the aldehyde carbon (PlC) of the inhibitor atom and also corresponded to a peak of 0.24 e/A3 on the difference map.

Since thermal motion of the O-l and O-2 atoms is highly correlated to that of the hemiacetal Ser1950G, PlC and PICA atoms, these atoms should have B factors of approximately the same magnitude. Based on these considerations, it, would appear that refinement trial III best describes the situation in the SGPA-chymostatin complex. That is, the covalent link between Ser1950G and the C terminus of chymostatin results in hemiacetal formation in which both the R and S enantiomers of the hemiacetal are present in t,he crystal structure in approximately equal amounts. During the first 27 cycles of least-squares refinement, the oxygen atom (O-l) that is located in the oxyanion hole was rest)rained as would be carried out for an oxygen of a carboxyl terminus. Subsequently, in 7 further cycles of refinement, starting with t)he parameters obtained after trial III, the distance and angle restraints on this atom were removed. Furthermore, van der Waals' contact restraint distances were set low enough to exclude any on the distances between the Ser195OG oxygen restraints atom and the C terminus of chymostatin. The R factor after these final 7 cycles of least-squares refinement was 0.123. 9 graph illustrating the course of least-squares refinement is given in Fig. 2. A plot of R factor versus the minimum d spacing in each group is given in Fig. 3. Reflections were grouped in ranges of d spacing with approximately 1000 reflections per group.

3. Results and Discussion
(a) Chymostatin complezation

High resolution data collection and subsequent restrained parameter least-squares refinement of the chymostatin-SGPA complex has confirmed the salient points obtained from an earlier medium resolution analysis (Delbaere & Brayer, 1980). The present analysis has allowed further insight into several crucial details at high resolution concerning complexation, in particular the presence of both the R and S hemiacetals in approximately equal proportions over the active site. In addition, this research has characterized the covalent nature of the complex formed. the molecular geometry of the location of solvent hemiacetal formation, molecules in the active site and has provided an for the differences between the location explanation of the His57 side-chain in the synthetic peptide aldehyde-SGPA and the chymostatin-SGPA complexes (Fig. 1). The final refined molecular model of the chymostatin-SPGA complex in the region of the active site is illustrated in Figure 4. The polypeptide chain backbone of chymostatin forms an anti-parallel beta-sheet interaction with

residues 214 t'o 216 of SGPA. A total of three hydrogen bonds are formed in this manner (refer to Table 5 for the exact distances). One of these is between the peptide amide group of the Pl phenylalaninyl residue and the carbonyl oxygen The remaining two atom of Ser214 of SGPA. hydrogen bonds are formed from the carbonyl oxygen atom and the peptide amide group of the P3 cychzed-arginine residue, to the amide group and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly216. respectively. The Pl phenyl side-chain of chymostatin lies in t,he primary specificity pocket of SGPA (Fig. 4). This pocket is defined by three regions of the the polypeptide chain from Ala192 to enzyme: Pro192B. the polypeptide chain from Ser214 to Gly218 and the bottom by Thr225 (not shown in Fig. 4). The primary specificity binding subsite is generally hydrophobic in character and t,he bound phenyl ring is aligned so that it is approximately coplanar with the planes of the peptide groups lining both sides of this binding site. The Pl phenylalaninyl side-chain is not likely to have a great deal of conformational freedom since the Sl subsite is quite restrictive in both shape and size. The P2 leucyl residue of the inhibitor is bound in the surface depression, which forms the S2 binding subsit'e. This binding site is also hydrophobic in nature. being formed by the side-chains of Phe94 and Tyr171, and portrons of main-chain in the vicinity of Ser174. The side-chain of His57 also forms one side of the S2 subsite. As is evident from side-chain appears t,o Figure 4. the P2 Ieucyl completely fill the available volume in this binding subsite. Analysis of bonding contacts confirms this fact, and side-chains of larger amino acid residues could not be accommodated at this position wit,hout major conformational changes. The sample of chymostatin used in t,his st,udy was a mixture of peptide aldehydes differing only as t,o t.he identity of the P2 residue. As a whole, 7896 of

t,his sample contained a P2 leucine, 17% a P2 valine and 5% a P2 isoleucine. The enzyme appears to bind selectively to the P2 leucine component of this mixture as judged from electron density fitting and subsequent final refinement statistics. Close scrutiny of difference and 21FJ -IF,/ electron den&y maps, following the final cycle of restrained parameter least-squares refinement, failed to reveal any trace of a valine or isoleucine residue bound in the 82 subsite. The present study confirms the unusual cyclized nature of the P3 arginine residue. The side-chain of this residue is projected away from the surface of t.he enzyme into surrounding solvent. Nevertheless, this cyclized moiety is an important component of inhibitory activity (Aoyagi & Umezawa, 1975) and has a significant impact on the bound conformation of chymostatin. The terminal P4 ureido and phenylalaninyl group lie in a poorly defined binding site at the extremity of the substrate binding region. Even so, these groups are well resolved in the present analysis, albeit with substantially higher thermal factors than surrounding residues. Major contacts in the S4 binding subsite involved the side-chains of Va1169, Tyrl7 1, Phe226 and parts of the polypeptide chain about Gly216 and Ser217. There is an additional interesting relationship between the positively chharged side-chain of the cyclized P3 arginine and the terminal P4 carboxylic acid group. In Figure 4, these two groups appear to be stacked roughly coplanar above and below one another, respectively. As can be seen from Figure 4, a number of solvent molecules are bound to the chymostat,in inhibit,or when it is complexed in the active site of SGPA. These include three directly in contact with the hrmiaretal group. Three others are bound to groups further removed from catalytic residues: the amide group of P2 leucine. the side-chain of P3 cvclized-arginine and the terminal carboxyl group of P4 phenylalanine. It is int,eresting to note the relationship between

the positioning of chymostatin in the active site and the solvenb molecules displaced from the enzyme surface as a result. In fact', a network of solvent molecules is bound to the native enzyme in such a manner that these molecules resemble the placement of the inhibitor (see Fig. 5). Particularly prominent is the close spatial relationship between the atoms of chymostatin that secure the inhibitor to the enzyme surface through hydrogen bonding and the solvent molecules found at similar positions in the native enzyme; the average r.m.s. difference is 0.51 8. Many other solvent molecules correspond t'o the location of other inhibitor atoms (see Fig. 5). (b) Hemiacetal
formatio?z

High resolution analysis has revealed the presence of two different enantiomers (R, S) of the hemiacetal adduct (see Figs 5 and 6). From t,his result it is evident that hemiacetal formation can occur from each of the two possible addition approaches, i.e. with either the planar aldehyde group oxygen atom pointing into the oxyanion hole or alternatively oriented towards His57. Since both resultant hemiacetal oxygen atom positions are equally populated (occupancies ~0.5), there is an apparent lack of preference for a particular incoming aldehyde group orientation from the point, of view of the subsequent nucleophilic attack by Serl95. Examination of the conformational angles involved shows that the hemiacetal products observed are tetrahedral in nature (Figs 4 and 5). The S configuration hemiacetal (oxygen 1, Fig. 4) has the aldehyde oxygen atom in the oxyanion hole; in this position hydrogen bonds are formed to the peptide amide groups of Gly193 and Ser195. The aldehyde carbon atom to aldehyde oxygen atom bond distance is 1.44 a (see Table 4). The calculated position of the aldehyde hydrogen atom of this hemiacetal grouping is towards His57, along

Only the portion of polypeptide chain from Gly193 to Ser195, the side-chain of His57 and the Pl residue of chymostatin are drawn. The two hemiacetal oxygen atom positions observed are labeled accordingly. thinner bonds are the positions of enzyme residues found in the native uncomplexed state. essentially the same directional vector as the R aldehyde oxygen position. hemiacetal In the R hemiacetal configuration the Pl aldehyde oxygen atom (oxygen 2, Fig. 4) is tetrahedrally displaced towards the catalytic histidine residue to which it forms a hydrogen bond (2.82 8). The aldehyde carbon atom to aldehyde oxygen atom distance is observed to be 1.63 A, slightly larger than this same bond in the S hemiacetal configuration. In the R configuration, the aldehyde hydrogen atom is directed into the oxyanion hole in an orientation very similar to that of oxygen atom 1 (Fig. 4). In agreement with observed stereochemical and spatial limitations within the of the present analysis active site, t'he results indicate that atoms of the Pl phenylalaninyl residue, other than O-l, O-2 and the corresponding hydrogen atoms, occupy essentially the same atomic positions in both configurations in the chymostatin-SGPA complex. As shown in Figure 6, hemiacetal complexation causes remarkably little movement in the positions of the catalytic residues. The bond formed between the gamma-oxygen atom of Ser195 and the aldehyde carbon atom of chymostatin has a length of 1.62 A. Thus it is clearly covalent in nature, albeit -0.2 A longer than the average distance observed for chemically similar bonds. This may be Overlaid and drawn with

compared to the 1.73 A corresponding distance found in the synthetic peptide aldehyde complex (James et al., 1980). An examination of the atoms of His57 and Ser195, in the present complex, shows that the gamma-oxygen atom of Ser195 experiences the largest displacement (0.33 A) and the greatest decrease in thermal factor (-8.7 A2). The distance from the position of the oxygen atom in the native to the aldehyde carbon atom in t,he enzyme complex is 1.67 8. Thus, most of the movement' involved has occurred to optimize the geometry of the interacting groups as opposed to shortening the initial distance between them. Clearly covalent, bond formation has solidified the positioning of the side-chain of Ser195 and indeed this residue shows an overall thermal parameter drop of - 3.0 A2 from the native. As a whole, displacements of the atoms of Ser195 from uncomplexed native atom positions are very limited, with an overall r.m.s. deviation of 0.15 A (see Table 3). This is only slightly larger than the displacements observed when all the protein non-hydrogen atoms of the chymostatin complex are compared to the observed native atomic positions (0.14 A). Similarly, the side-chain of His57 remains relatively unperturbed upon chymostatin binding (Fig. 6). The largest movement is that of the CD2 atom of the imidazole ring (0.09 A). The overall r.m.s. displacement of atomic positions of

this residue from those of the native enzyme is 0.06 A. However. an average overall increase of thermal parameters of +2.2 A2 is observed, with the maximal increase ( + 6.9 A2) being experienced by the ND1 atom of the imidazole ring. These values suggest that, even though His57 remains in place upon inhibitor binding, complexation induces larger mean thermal atomic displacements. Figure 4 reveals a triad of water molecules bound t,o the two hemiacetal oxygen atom positions. One of these is closest to hemiacetal oxygen atom position 1. while the other two are hydrogenbonded to the hemiacetal oxygen atom at position 2. In keeping with the observed occupancy of O-l and O-2, each of these solvent molecules is also present at approximately half occupancy. (c) A r&ted synthetic peptide aldehyde

The conformation of a related synthetic peptide aldehyde bound in the active site of SGPA has been determined to high resolution (James et al., 1980), utilizing techniques similar to those described in the present st,udy. The chemical structure of this is shown in Figure l(b). The common inhibit)or features of these inhibitors are an active phenylalaninyl PI group and the same overall size. Currently, structural studies of inhibitor complexation by both ch.ymostatin and the synthetic peptide aldehyde are at a very similar stage, thereby affording an ideal opport,unit,y for t'heir comparison.

To facilitate such a comparison, portions of the catalytic site of SGPA and the two inhibitors have been overlaid in Figure 7. One major difference between the two complexes is immediately apparent upon inspection. Namely, as noted previously by Brayer et al. (1979), in the synthetic complex the catalytic histidine residue is ejected into the surrounding solvent, from the position it occupied in the native enzyme. Tn contrast, this residue in the chymostatin complex retains essentially the same position as t,hat found in the native enzyme (r.m.s. difference 0.06 A). At 2.8 A resolution it had been suggested by Delbaere & Brayer (1980) that in the case of the synthetic peptide aldehyde, the His57 movement was the consequence of prohibitively close contacts developing upon inhibitor binding, particularly between the covalent hemiacetal group (formed with the catalytic serine residue) and the imidazole ring of His57. The current high resolution data suggest that this is indeed the case. These close contacts do not occur in the chymostatin-SGPA complex because this inhibitor polypeptide chain is shifted away from His57 (as compared with that in the synthetic peptide-SGPA complex) due to steric interactions of the P2 leucyl side-chain wit.h the 82 subsite of SGPA (vide in&z). Computation of the hemiacetal hydrogen atom position (formerly the incoming aldehyde hydrogen) of the synthetic peptide places this atom only 2.6 !I from the NE2 position of the imidiazole ring of His57 as it is

found in the native enzyme. Note that the pH conditions used in these studies (pH 4.1) are such that histidyl residues should be fully protonated. Further calculations show the distance from the hemiacetal hydrogen atom to the hydrogen atom at the NE2 position of His57 is 1.6 A. Clearly this interaction is much smaller than the van der Waals' contact distance and is prohibitively short. This explains the observed displacement of the His57 side-chain in the synthetic peptide aldehydee SGPA complex. In contrast, the closest approach of the hemiacetal hydrogen atom of the S configuration in the chymostatin complex to His57 is 3.0 A and this hydrogen atom is located 2.0 a from the hydrogen atom at the NE2 position. Both of these values are fully 0.4 A larger than those observed in the synthetic peptide aldehyde case. Thus while the fit of chymostatin at the catalytic site is optimally close, the contact distances observed would not be expected to result in substantial conformational in the chymostatin hemichanges. Furthermore, acetal R configuration, spatial conflict is also avoided; the distance from the hemiacetal oxygen atom O-2 to the NE2 position on His57 is 2.8 8. This is ideal for the formation of a hydrogen bond and is apparently a factor in the observed stability of the His57 side-chain for the R configuration hemiacetal complex. It seems readily apparent t'hat the differential effects observed for the two peptide aldehydes are a of the two different, hemiacetal consequence positions. From Figure 7 it is clear that, the hemiacetal group of chymostatin is shifted away from His57 towards the oxyanion hole as compared with the hemiacetal group of the synthetic peptide. The overall average displacement of these hemiacetal groups is O-5 8. As would be expected, the gamma-oxygen atom of Ser195 to which this group is covalently attached in the chymostatin complex is similarly displaced (0.3 A). The shifts observed for the chymostatin complex place the hemiacetal oxygen atom of the S configuration further into the oxyanion hole than occurs for the related synthetic peptide oxygen atom. Hydrogenbond distances to the amide hydrogen atom positions of Gly193 and Ser195 are 1.9 a and 2.0 fi, respectively, for chymostatin. These same distances are 2.0 A and 2.3 A, respectively, in the synthetic complex. Note in Figure 7 that peptide aldehyde the polypeptide chain forming the oxyanion hole is relatively unperturbed by the differing inhibitor conformations. Since in these structural studies only the chemical compositions of the two inhibitors are different, it is likely that steric effects are the cause of the differential His57 conformations observed. Indeed, as can be seen in Figure 7, the entire length of chymostatin is shifted away from His57. including those residues much too remote to be in direct' contact with this residue. The r.m.s. difference of all the common atoms between the synthetic peptide aldehyde and chymostatin (21 total) is 0.74 A (see Table 3). By way of comparison, the observed r.m.s. difference in the positions of the enzyme atoms of both complexes (excluding the side-chain of His57) is only 0.15 A. Clearly these results indicate, as does Figure 7, that the two inhibitors have significantly differing binding positions. Overall, the largest shift of inhibitor backbone occurs at the P2 leucyl residue, which has an average displacement of O-9 A. Figure 7 shows that the leucyl side-chain protrudes further into the S2 subsite than the equivalent prolyl sidebinding chain of the synthetic peptide aldehyde. Indeed, it' seems unlikely that side-chains larger than that of leucine could be readily accommodated at this position. The necessity to avoid prohibitive contacts by the leucyl side-chain in this binding subsite appears to be a major factor in the observed displacement of the main-chain of this residue.

Complex between Chymostatin and SGPA
Contact distances with groups forming the S2 subsite indicate a very tight fit with the leucyl side- 1 A outward chain, and that without the displacement of this residue as a whole, prohibitive contacts would develop. It should be noted that His57 forms one side of the S2 subsite and is in intimate contact with the side-chain bound at this point. Indeed, while there is no steric hindrance to the movement of the His57 side-chain in the chymostatin complex, this residue could not occupy exactly the same position as that found in the synthetic aldehyde case, since conflicts would arise with the extremity of the P2 leucyl side-chain. A further consequence of the shift in chymostatin position is the re-orientation of the Pl phenyl ring in the primary specificity pocket. As can be seen from Figure 4, this phenyl ring is stacked against the planar peptide groups of residues 192-192B. Readjustment in this manner results from the shift of the backbone of chymostatin, which has also caused this side-chain to be similarly displaced in binding subsite. what is already a rather restrictive A similar directional displacement is observed for the P3 residue of chymostatin, although in magnitude it is somewhat diminished (0.5 A for main-chain atoms). The beta-carbon of this residue is also significantly altered in orientation compared to that observed in the bound synthetic peptide adlehyde complex. Since the P3 residue in the synthetic complex is an alanine, comparison beyond this point is not possible. It is known, however, that t,he P3 cyclized-arginyl side-chain of chymostatin is an important feature in its effectiveness as an inhibitor. The stacking interaction between the positively charged cyclized P3 arginine group and the negatively charged terminal carboxyl group of the I'4 phenylalanine (the distance between P3NH, and 1'4(' is 3.8 A) may also play a role in maintaining the bound conformation of chymostatin. Despite its distal proximity from the catalytic site, the P4 ureido and phenylalaninyl groups are similarly shifted when compared to the positioning of the synthetic inhibitor in this binding subsite. However, as is evident from Figure 7, the magnitude of this displacement is relatively small. Comparison of the synthetic peptide aldehyde

and chymostatin structures bound in the native site of SGPA indicate that they both form hemiacetal adducts with the catalytic serine residue. Nevertheless, the effect that hemiacetal formation has on the conformation of the catalytic residue, His57, is clearly dependent on the inhibitor amino acid further removed from the catalytic composition site. In the case of the synthetic inhibitors, the sidechain of His57 is ejected into surrounding solvent as a consequence of prohibitively close contacts between the hemiacetal group formed and the native position of this residue. Exchange of the P2 proline residue by a leucyl residue in chymostatin appears to be the major factor in alleviating any hemiacetyl His57 conflict in this complex. This is a result of the optimal fit of the leucyl side-chain in the S2 binding subsite. The exact nature of residues bound in subsites further removed from the catalytic site also appear to effect the favored approach of the aldehyde group to Ser195 during hemiacetal addition. In the case of the synthetic aldehyde inhibitor, only the S hemiacetal, formed by the placement of the aldehyde oxygen atom in the hole, is observed. Either aldehyde group oxyanion approach, that is with the aldehyde oxygen atom oriented towards the oxyanion hole or in the direction of His57, is possible and is likely in the chymostatin complex. These results clearly point' out the importance of binding effects remote from the catalytic site and their influence on the events that occur during enzymatic inhibition.

differential effects of inhibitors and peptides (i) Enzyme conformation
At this point it is valuable to analyze more quantitatively the effects of inhibitor binding on SGPA as a whole, and more particularly on those residues that have been implicated in serine protease catalysis. To make these considerations more complete, a comparison with the structural results arising from a SGPA-product peptide complex (James et al., 1980) are included (see Tables 3, 4 and 5). The product peptide involved (PAPF) has the amino acid sequence Ac-Pro-Ala-

Pro-Phe-COz. The complex formed can be obtained by soaking native SGPA crystals in solutions of AcPro-Ala-Pro-Phe-COX where X is -NH,, -Phe or -(Ala),. The enzyme cleaves the C-terminal X group producing the terminal carboxylate group observed in diffraction experiments. Note that the chemical structure of this peptide is very similar to that of the synthetic peptide aldehyde discussed earlier. An overall comparison of r.m.s. displacements for each SGPA-complex is shown in Table 3. It is evident from these data that the native enzyme structure experiences rather small displacements as a consequence of complex formation. The largest of these (0.15 A) involves the synthetic peptide aldehyde, but this value is not markedly higher than those of the other peptides. Even smaller r.m.s. differences are observed when considering only main-chain atoms. Further comparisons among the different complexes indicate displacements of a similar magnitude. More significant displacements are observed when considering only the individual inhibitor positions (Table 3). The largest of these between complexes occurs between the synthetic peptide aldehyde and chymostatin (0.74 A). There is also a significant and PAPF difference (0.58 A) between chymostatin positions. A smaller but still substantial shift is observed in the bound conformations of the synthetic peptide aldehyde and its carboxylic acid counterpart (O-37 A). Clearly, when comparing these different complexes, the positioning of bound peptides in the active site of SGPA is much more variable than that observed for the enzyme structure that is bound to these peptides. The lower part of the matrix of Table 3 details thermal parameter differences between the native enzyme and the various complexes. Although all of the changes observed upon comparison to the native enzyme are relatively small, again the largest involves a net decrease in this value for the synthetic peptide aldehyde. This trend is less pronounced for the chymostat'in and PAPF complexes, but is of a similar direction. Differences between the enzyme structures of t'he various complexes themselves are less marked. In essence, Table 3 indicates that the overall enzyme structure shows less thermal motion as a consequence of that this effect is most and complexation pronounced in the case of peptide aldehydes. A clear distinction is evident' in Table 3 when the peptide structures independently. considering Thermal parameters chymostatin are for significantly lower than either the synthetic aldehyde or PAPF peptides. This is the case even though the enzyme structure of the synthetic aldehyde complex experiences a much larger drop in overall thermal parameter and the decrease in the PAPF complex is comparable to that of the chymostatin complex. Evidently the backbone of chymostatin is bound much more tightly in the active site of SGPA than its peptide counterparts, despite its smaller effect on enzyme structure as a whole.

The bars indicate those regions of polypeptide chain which undergo the largest shifts upon complexation with chymostatin. Side-chain displacements for glycine residues were set equal to zero. Residue numbers are based on the polypeptide chain sequence alignment reported by James et al. (1978).

A more comprehensive analysis of t'he effects of peptide binding can be achieved by comparing, on an individual amino acid residue basis, r.m.s. deviations from native enzyme atom positions. As Figure S(a) shows, in agreement with Table 3, the displacements in the chymostatin complex from native positions are relatively small. The pat,tern of side-chain displacements is quite random, with the largest being associated with SerlZOD. However, in that case the differences observed arise from two independent positions of this residue due to rather than any effect of binding disorder, chymostatin. The line representing main-chain atoms shows sustained deviations in three regions of polypeptide chain as indicated by the underlining bars in Figure S(a). The first of these includes residues Asn170 to Gly175, a region of polypeptide chain forming the outer wall of the S2 binding subsite. A second region encompasses residues Ala192 to Serl95, which forms the inner surface of the primary specificity pocket. The portion of polypeptide chain with the largest displacements involves residues from Ser214 to Thr225. These residues have a multifaceted role in complexation,

forming parts of the Sl and 54 binding subsites, as well as hydrogen-bonding the main-chain backbone of the bound peptide. Comparison of the displacements in the chymosynthetic aldehyde complexes is statin and presented in Figure 8(b). This graph shows greater fluctuations but no general trends are evident. This is not surprising, since both aldehydes would be expected to induce similar enzyme shifts, even though differences in their binding modes are present. Naturally, the largest peak present arises as a result of the observed movement of the sidechain of His57 in the synthetic aldehyde complex. A similar situation 1s evident on comparison of chymostatin and PAPF complexes in the Figure 8(c). The two largest peaks (Serl2011, Ile176) are not the result of differential inhibitor binding, but of independent placements of these side-chains in the disordered electron density observed for t)hem. Two main-chain regions, residues 192 to 195 and 214 to 225. show small systematic changes but the values observed are not significantly greater than t'he background levels observed. Thus. in general, t,he chymostatin and PAPF complexes also to induce appear quite similar enzyme displacement,s. Another way of analyzing the effects of complexation is to examine the effects of inhibitor binding on the thermal parameters of the enzyme. Figure 9(a) indicates the values obtained along the length of the SGPA polypeptide chain when considering the chymostatin complex alone. Certain regions show more motion than others. The pattern of variability observed here is remarkably similar to that' observed for the native enzyme alone (see <James ef al., 1980; Fig. 5). The difference between the values obtained for the native and for the chymostatin-complexed enzyme is illustrated in Figure 9(b). With the exception of the region containing residues 214 to 225, the differences appear quite random. This is the portion of polypeptide chain that has the highest thermal parameters in Figure 9(a) and that forms the most int,imat,e contacts with the bound inhibitor. It, is also in this region that the largest displacements of enzyme positions are observed (Fig. 8(a)). It is evident from these data that the bound inhibitor considerably reduces the thermal motion of these residues, but they still remain the most mobile atoms in the enzyme structure. Figure 9(c) and (d) show the differences in SPGA t'hermal motions when comparing the chymostatin complex against that of the synthetic aldehyde and its corresponding carboxylic acid, respectively. Both graphs show considerable variability throughout and no region of polypeptide chain could be said to undergo concerted change. The region about Ser214 to Thr225 would appear to have lower thermal parameters but the peaks observed are not significantly above the surrounding ones. Of course the large negative peak at His.57, Figure 9(c), arises from this residue being expelled into solvent in the synthet,ic peptide aldehyde complex where it

As reference to Table 4 indicates, the covalent bond to Ser195 is somewhat shorter when chymostatin is bound than in the synthetic peptide aldehyde case. This distance is much longer in the PAPF complex where clearly a covalent bond is not formed. Nevertheless, the distance observed in PAPF is shorter than that expected for a van der Waals' contact.

The actual His57 side-chain position in this complex is 10(c). Steric conflict between the newly formed hemiacetal group and His57 appears to be responsible for of the side-chain of this residue into surrounding solvent upon formation of the hemiacetal product. tions of chymostatin are independent, their structures taken together closely resemble the structure one would expect if the carboxyl group of PAPF were fully tetrahedralized by the formation of a covalent bond to Ser195. In this respect, the chymostatin complex serves as a model for the intermediates generated during tetrahedral catalysis. Reference to Table 5 shows that the various complexes have very little effect, on the hydrogenbonding network among the principle active site residues. Of course a major exception to this involves His57 in the synthetic aldehyde case, but even here the other active site residues appear unperturbed. Overall the smallest differences are between the native and chvmostatin-complexed active site interactions. As pointed out by Sielecki et al. (1979), the interaction involving His57 and Ser195 is a poor hydrogen bond in the native enzyme. This distance lengthens in both the chymostatin and PAPF complexes as the side-chain of Ser195 is repositioned to form a more favorable contact with the Pl carbon atmom. It is also clear from Table 5 that the three enzyme hydrogen bonds formed with the polypeptide backbone of the bound inhibitors are similar in length, although in all cases these interactions are strongest in the chymostatin complex. Table 6 compares the conformational angles of the polypeptide chain held in common between bound peptides and those of the major catalytic

distances in the hemiacetal conformations of the chymostatin complex (PlC.. .0-l, 1.44 A; PlC. .O-2, 1.63 A) are longer than the equivalent bond of the synthetic aldehyde complex. The significance of this difference is uncertain, since the refinement of bound chymostatin did not have this interaction restrained, whereas the refinement of the synthetic aldehyde complex (James et al., 1980) restrained this distance to 1.25 A. The results from the chymostatin complex suggest that this bond should be of the order of - 1.5 A in length. It is evident from Table 4 that a conflict in the form of short, contacts develops between the hemiacetal group of the synthetic aldehyde and the His57 native enzyme position. This is illustrated in Figure 11, which is the same as Figure 10(c) except that the His57 present is in the native enzyme conformation. Comparison with Figure 10(a) shows that the hemiacetal group of chymostatin is oriented to alleviat,e this spatial conflict. His57 is positioned in virtually identical manners in both the native and chymostatin-complexed enzyme structures. The R hemiacetal oxygen atom (O-2, Fig. lO( b)) of the chymostatin complex is positioned towards His57 to which it, forms a hydrogen bond. This oxygen atom, like its counterpart in t,he PAPF complex (Figure 10(d)). does not spatially conflict with the native position of His57. Indeed, as Figure 12 illustrates, the O-l and O-2 oxygen atom positions in t'he chymostatin and PAPF complexes are similar. Alt,hough the two hemiacetal configura-

The values indicate an - 15" change in orientation for the phenylalaninyl ring and this can be seen in Figures 7 and 12. An -65" change in the x1 angle of the P2 residue of chymostatin is present upon comparison with the other peptides. A major contributing factor to this change is likely to be the very tight fit of the leucyl side-chain in the S2 binding subsite.

4. Implications

for the Catalytic

Mechanism

The overwhelming weight of evidence from inhibitor studies of serine crystallographic proteases, including this work, supports the concept that these enzymes are designed to stabilize a co-ordinated species covalent, tetrahedrally (Marquart et al., 1983; Matthews et al., 1975; Poulos et al., 1976; Stroud et al., 1974; James et al., 1980). Enzymes are thought to catalyze reactions by providing an active site that is complementary to the substrate in it's transition state configuration 1976). Pyramidal distortions of the (Wolfenden, relevant carbon atom in both the trypsin-bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex and the trypsin-porcine secretory trypsin inhibitor complex have been reported (Bode, Schwager & Huber, free 1976; Marquart et al., 1983). The standard

energy for the hydrolysis of a peptide bond is negative (McGilvery & Goldstein, 1983): thus, thermodynamically, the hydrolysis of peptide bonds is favorable. However, peptide bonds under normal conditions are kinetically stable to hydrolysis due to the large activation energy barrier which is required to be overcome in order for hydrolysis to occur: t,he major portion of this activation energy barrier is due to the resonance stabilizat'ion energy of the peptide bond, -20 kcal/ mole (Pauling, 1960; Fersht. 1971). The peptide bond must be planar in order to have this resonance stabilization energy. We propose that the major force for the hydrolysis of peptide bonds by driving serine proteases is the non-planar dist,ortion of the scissile bond by the enzyme, thereby lowering the activat'ion energy barrier to hydrolysis bv eliminating the resonance stabilization energy of the peptide bond. The present study provides a possible representation of the tetrahedral product, intermediate for a true substrate as a consequence of the statistical occupancy of both the R and 8 hemiacetals over the same active site (see Fig. 5) by neglecting the hydrogen atoms of the hemiacetals. By examining Figure 12, and also neglecting the hydrogen atoms of the hemiacetals, one can consider the process of going from the enzyme/product intermediate that, has been isolated at pH 4.1 (James et al., 1980) to this tetrahedral product species, mainly by the pyramidalization of the pertinent carbon atom towards the Ser195 gamma-oxygen atom. The question arises as to why the covalent, tetrahedral product' intermediate is not stable enough to be isolated whereas hemiacetals such as the one reported in this study are stable? One possible explanation is that the covalent tetrahedral product species is unstable with respect to

dissociation of the Ser195 alkoxide ion to yield the planar carboxylate group of the product. The planar carboxylate group has a resonance stabiliza(Gutsche & Pasto, tion energy of - 15 kcal/mole 1975). On the other hand, the free aldehyde group does not have this resonance stabilization energy and thus the hemiacetal group does not have this tendency to spontaneously dissociate.
