ABSTRACT: GM2-activator protein (GM2AP) is a lysosomal lipid transfer protein with important biological roles in ganglioside catabolism, phospholipid metabolism, and T-cell activation. Previous studies of crystal structures of GM2AP complexed with the physiological ligand GM2 and platelet activating factor (PAF) have shown binding at two specific locations within the spacious apolar pocket and an ordering effect of endogenous resident lipids. To investigate the structural basis of phospholipid binding further, GM2AP was cocrystallized with phosphatidylcholine (PC), known to interact with GM2AP. Analysis of three crystal forms revealed binding of single chain lipids and fatty acids only and surprisingly not intact PC. The regions of best defined electron density are consistent with the presence of lyso-PC and oleic acid, which constitute deacylation products of PC. Their acyl tails are in stacking contact with shorter, less well-defined stretches of electron density that may represent resident fatty acids. The GM2AP associated hydrolytic activity that generates lyso-PC was further confirmed by mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. In addition, we report the structures of (i) mutant Y137S, assessing the role of Tyr137 in lipid transfer via the hydrophobic cleft, and (ii) apo-mouse GM2AP, revealing a hydrophobic pocket with a constricted opening. Our structural results provide new insights into the biological functions of GM2AP. The combined effect of hydrolytic and lipid transfer properties has profound implications in cellular signaling.

GM2-activator protein (GM2AP)1 is one of five wellcharacterized lysosomal glycosphingolipid activator proteins that play essential roles in the hydrolytic degradation of gangliosides by exo-glycosidases. These enzymatic processes are essential to prevent ganglioside accumulation in neuronal tissue that leads to the fatal condition known as Tay Sachs disease (1, 2). The activator proteins, including four genetically related sulfatide activator proteins (saposins), are

characterized by their small molecular size and large hydrophobic pockets for binding long-chain lipids (3, 4). Their best known function is to solubilize specific gangliosides from membranes to be presented to enzyme active sites for removal of the nonreducing terminal sugars. GM2AP is unique among this family of proteins in that it has high specificity for GM2 (5), and its structure is unrelated to that of saposin B (4). It acts as a specific cofactor for lysosomal -hexosaminidase A (HexA), which converts GM2 to GM3 by removal of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (1, 5). Crystal structure analysis revealed a structural fold dominated by a central apolar cup-shaped pocket that consists mostly of -sheet (3) contrasting with the saposins that possess an R-helical fold and function as dimers (1, 4). The spacious pocket is two to three times larger compared with cavities of highly specific lipid-binding proteins (6). In addition to their function as enzyme cofactors, these activator proteins have the ability to transfer glyco- and phospholipids between donor and acceptor liposomes in vitro (5, 7, 8). In recent years, evidence has emerged for other important biological functions of GM2AP. For instance, involvement of GM2AP in CD1-mediated lipid antigen presentation to T-cells was suggested based on its ability to load and unload specific lipids from CD1d and CD1b molecules in an affinitybased exchange (9, 10). Since both CD1 and GM2AP molecules are localized in the late endosomal compartments, it has been suggested that their interaction could be of vital importance for both immune response and lipid metabolism. Moreover, GM2AP was shown to interact with phospholipids

FIGURE 1: Stereoview of the superimposed backbone folds of individual monomers in the three crystal structures GM2AP1-PC, GM2AP2PC, and GM2AP3-PC. The four loop regions of interest are labeled: W131 loop (Ser130-Thr133), apolar loop (Val59-Trp63), Y71 loop (Thr69Ile72), and helix-turn (Asp85-Cys94). The sequence numbering convention is for the mature protein of 162 residues. The color code is as follows: cyan, GM2AP1-PC; yellow, monomer B of GM2AP2-PC; magenta, monomer B of GM2AP3-PC; blue, monomer C of GM2AP3PC. The arrow identifies the starting point of the disordered strand. This figure was prepared with DINO (http://www.cobra.mih.unibas.ch/ dino/).

and stimulate the activity of phospholipase D under high salt conditions and in a dose-dependent manner (11-13). We have determined a number of crystal structures of GM2AP expressed in Escherichia coli with and without added lipid. This work led to identification of regions within the apolar pocket that are used for lipid binding (6, 14). Moreover, comparison of these structures in different crystal forms and crystallographic environments has revealed a high degree of dynamics likely to be a function of lipid association. Flexibility of external loops that decorate the rim of the cavity, a common feature of lipid transfer proteins (4, 15), appears to control the size of the pocket opening and the width of a hydrophobic cleft thought to serve as a lipid transfer channel (6). This channel has an open and closed conformation depending on (i) lateral movements of the flexible strand Asp125-Pro129 and (ii) the orientation of the mobile Ser130-Thr133 reverse turn (termed W131 loop), which has two discrete positions (6) (see Figure 1). In those structures in which the cleft is open, bound lipid is observed within the hydrophobic cleft (site I) as well as deep inside the pocket (site II) (14). Analysis of these structures revealed that the headgroups of bound GM2 and phospholipids occupy different locations. The GM2 tetrasaccharide moiety was found to be disordered, as it is exposed on the protein surface (6). It was modeled in a region close to the single alpha-helix. Phospholipids bind in two positions with their headgroups partly bound in hydrophobic environments. In the case of bound platelet activating factor (PAF), one molecule binds near the side chain of Ser141 inside the pocket, and the second molecule interacts with the side chain of Tyr137 at the entrance of the cleft (14). The alkyl chains are positioned inside the pocket and not near the flexible peptide strand (Asp125-Leu128), as suggested by Wendeler et al. (16) based on photoaffinity labeling studies. Here, we describe the structures of three new crystal complexes of GM2AP, prepared in the presence of 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC). The ability of GM2AP to interact with PC has been suggested in several

studies previously but was never structurally characterized (5, 12, 13). PC is the most common phospholipid in eukaryotes. Because of its low aqueous solubility, it requires transport by specific transfer proteins, such as human PC transfer protein whose crystal structure is known (15). Importantly, none of the three crystal structures analyzed show bound PC inside the hydrophobic pocket. The electron density is consistent only with bound single chain lipids, suggesting that PC has been hydrolyzed. Crystallographic and solution data are presented confirming that hydrolytic activity is associated with GM2AP. Two additional structures were investigated: (i) the Y137S-PC mutant, testing the involvement of Tyr137 in phospholipid headgroup binding and stabilization of the mobile W131 loop, and (ii) apomouse GM2AP to better understand its unique binding properties toward GM2 and HexA and its milder Tay Sachs symptoms (17, 18). EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Human GM2AP PC Complexes. (a) Crystallization and Data Collection. Human wild-type GM2AP and the Y137S mutant were expressed in E. coli using a His-tag expression vector and purified as described previously (6). 18:1 PC was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. The following protocol was used for the cocrystallization experiments: Fifteen microliters of 12.7 mM PC (10 mg/mL in chloroform) was evaporated on a glass slide. The dry residue was solubilized in a small volume of ethanol and subsequently combined with 150 µL of the 0.3 mM protein solution (5.4 mg/mL) prepared in 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The molar excess of PC over protein in the reaction mixture was 3:1. After 3 h of incubation at room temperature, the mixture was applied to a 0.8 × 15 cm S-200 Sephacryl column, equilibrated with 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6), to remove unbound micellar phospholipid material. The eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ mL in a Beckmann GS-15R centrifuge for crystallization. To verify the presence of lipid, a 30 µL sample was extracted

with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Two major peaks were observed at masses of 522.3 for lyso-PC (lyso-1-oleolyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and 786.5 for PC, indicating cleavage at the sn-2 acyl bond. Purity of the PC reagent was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis, which showed a single mass at 786.5. Crystallization trials yielded three types of well-ordered crystals that diffracted beyond 2 Å resolution (see Table 1). These crystals grew within one week by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at 5 °C from a buffer solution containing 21-25% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 4000, 10% (v/v) 2-propanol and 0.1M Hepes buffer at pH values of 5.6, 7.3, and 7.6. Droplets prepared by mixing 2 µL of the protein solution with 2 µL of reservoir buffer solution were equilibrated over 0.5 mL of reservoir buffer. Crystals grown from 25% PEG4000 at pH 5.6 and 7.6 were of similar morphology as those of the apo protein (3, 19). A highly ordered monoclinic crystal form (P21) was obtained from 21% PEG4000 at pH 7.3, diffracting to 1.6 Å resolution. The PC complex of the Y137S mutant was prepared similarly and crystallized using a 7.0 mg/mL protein solution and a 22% PEG4000 reservoir buffer (pH 7.9). The crystal morphology consisted of thin plates that tended to form multiple stacks. These crystals belong to space group P1 and

possess a small cell of two independent monomers (see Table 1). The intensity data measured to 2 Å resolution scaled with a relatively high scaling R-factor (8-10%). This is believed to be due to large absorption effects reflected in the wide range of of scale factors (0.26-1.0) and mosaicities (0.45 to 1.26) between images. For data collection crystals were mounted by flashfreezing. During mounting, the crystallization droplet was covered with parafin oil to prevent evaporation of 2-propanol. Data collection was carried out at beamlines IMCA-CAT and SERCAT (APS Argonne National Laboratory). X-ray data were collected to resolution limits and reduced with HKL2000 (20). Final statistics are summarized in Table 2. (b) Structure Determination and Refinement. The structures of the new crystal forms, GM2AP2-PC and Y137SPC, were solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (21, 22). Monomer B of the human apo structure (1PU5) served as search model for the rotational and translational searches of GM2AP2-PC. In the case of Y137SPC, the GM2AP2-PC dimer provided an excellent search model. The initial models were examined with "O" (23) and submitted to rigid body refinement and minimization, using CNS (24), followed by model inspection. Structure refinement of all four structures was carried out with the program

GM2-Activator Phospholipid Complexes suite CNS (Table 2). The structure of Y173S-PC was refined at 2.2 Å resolution because of the lack of completeness at 2.0 Å resolution (67%). Water, solvent, and lipid molecules were gradually added in the refinement process. Bound lipid and fatty acids were located from "composite omit" maps after three cycles of structure refinement at 2.5 Å resolution and characterized according to the size and shape of the available electron density. The final models adhere to proper stereochemistry showing 100% of the amino acid residues in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot analyzed with PROCHECK (21). Model coordinates for LPC, OLA, MYR, and LAU were obtained from the HICUP server (25). Electron density maps were computed and structure analysis carried out with the program suite CCP4 (21). Modeling was performed with the graphics program O (23). Mouse-GM2AP. Wild-type mouse-GM2AP was prepared by the same protocol as human GM2AP (17, 19). The protein (8 mg/mL in 0.02 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from a crystallization reservoir (0.5 mL) containing 22.5% PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6, and 0.2 M ammonium acetate. Droplets of 6 µL of protein were mixed with 4 µL reservoir buffer and equilibrated over 0.5 mL reservoir buffer. Large rhombohedral crystals grew at room temperature within two weeks. These crystals belong to space group P212121 with cell dimensions a ) 42.98 Å, b ) 51.27 Å, and c ) 92.3 Å and one monomer per asymmetric unit. X-ray intensity data were measured at room temperature on an in-house Rigaku R-AXIS IIC image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray generator and were reduced with HKL2000 (20). The data extended to 2.5 Å resolution and scaled with an Rm of 6.1% (see Table 2). Using monomer A of human GM2AP (1G13) as search model, the structure was determined by molecular replacement and subsequently refined with CNS (24) (see Table 2). Fluorimetric Phospholipase A2 ActiVity Assay. Human GM2AP was prepared using a bacterial expression system as described previously (6). Purified protein solutions were diluted with 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) such that 1 µg was contained in the assay mixture of 100 µL (protein concentration around 0.56 µM). To selectively measure hydrolysis at the sn-2 ester bond, the bifunctional fluorescent substrate PED6 (N-(6-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) amine)hexanoyl 2-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-sindacene-3-pentanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine triethylammonium salt) was used (purchased from Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). A 1.0 mM stock solution of PED6, solubilized in ethanol, was prepared and serially diluted with the assay buffer yielding a concentration range of 50-0.05 µM. The solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity measurements were made at excitation and emission maxima of 475 and 525 nm, respectively, using a FlexStation (Molecular Devices). The values were compared to a standard curve prepared with the fluorescent product fatty acid BODIPY-Fl-C5 (4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoic acid). Time Study of LPC Production in the PC/GM2AP Reaction Mixture. The enzyme autotaxin, a mammalian lyso-phospholipase D (lyso-PLD), was used to detect the presence of LPC in GM2AP/PC reaction mixtures. Cleavage occurs at

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 41, 2005 13513 the phosphodiester bond with the release of choline, detected colorimetrically by use of an enzyme cocktail containing choline oxidase and horseradish peroxidase (26). The assay conditions were as follows: A 60 µL reaction mixture containing GM2AP (2.5 mg/mL) dissolved in 25 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.0), and 1 mM 18:1 PC solubilized in ethanol was incubated at room temperature for various time periods. Samples of 9 µL were removed at 2, 4, 8, 22, 33, and 50 h of incubation. As a control, the same reaction mixture was prepared in the absence of GM2AP, as well as in the presence of 2% -octylglucoside and 0.1% Triton X-100. The 9 µL aliquots were diluted to 100 µL by addition of a pH 8.0 buffer composed of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100. This solution was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 µg of autotaxin prepared as described previously (27). Subsequently, an equal volume of enzyme cocktail, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.7 mM N-ethylN-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-m-toluidine (TOOS), 4.5 mM 4-aminoantipyrine, 47.7 u/mL horseradish peroxidase, 18 u/mL choline oxidase, was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The amount of choline release was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 550 nm using a standard curve for choline. RESULTS 1. Structure Refinement of Different Crystal Forms. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the crystallization data and refinement statistics for the five structures presented here. The low and high pH orthorhombic crystal forms, GM2AP1-PC and GM2AP3-PC, correspond to those of apo-GM2AP (3, 6, 19), with one and three monomers per asymmetric unit, respectively. GM2AP2-PC and Y137S-PC represent new crystal forms of lower symmetry (P21 and P1). Both structures crystallized as thin plates and contain an identical noncrystallographic dimer in the asymmetric unit. GM2AP2-PC is the best refined structure at 1.8 Å resolution, including a large number of water molecules (Table 2). The structure of the Y137S mutant is of lower quality, retaining a high value of Rfree (32.75%) despite extensive efforts of refinement and model building (see Table 2). This is partly due to poor crystal scaling and lack of completeness of the 2.2 Å resolution data (77%). GM2AP1-PC represents a more highly refined low pH structure of GM2AP at 2 Å resolution compared with the corresponding 2.5 Å apo structure (6). It includes a larger number of waters and four well-defined fatty acid molecules (see Table 2). Mouse apo-GM2AP, which has 73.5% sequence identity with the human protein, was also crystallized in space group P212121 under low pH conditions (pH 5.6). This crystal form differs from that of human GM2AP1 both in cell size and molecular packing. Table 3 summarizes the types of lipid and fatty acid molecules refined in four of the structures reported here. The high values of their atomic B-factors (50-70 Å2) (Table 2) are typical for thermally disordered loosely associated lipids. The combined information from the structures reported here and from previously determined ligand complexes (6, 14) has allowed us to identify preferred binding regions within the spacious hydrophobic pocket. All binding regions identified contain at least one aromatic side chain (Tyr137, Tyr71,

Wright et al. 3. Fatty Acid Association. The binding pockets of each of the five structures examined contain extended stretches of electron density that could be modeled as alkyl chains 1218 carbons in length (Table 3). Their presence may derive from two sources: (i) cleavage of the acyl tail of PC, as evidenced by the presence of bound OLA in GM2AP1-PC, GM2AP2-PC, and GM2AP3-PC (see Table 3), and (ii) fatty acids that were trapped during refolding and solubilization of the protein from inclusion bodies. While their identity may differ at specific binding locations, they were typically found to be associated with acyl chains of LPC or other fatty acids. The longest stretches of electron density were modeled as OLA, although there is no clear evidence that it derives from hydrolysis of PC. OLA is particularly well defined in binding site II of GM2AP1-PC (Figure 4a). This low pH structure, with a wide open binding pocket, contains fatty acids only and no LPC (Table 3). In GM2AP2-PC, a shorter stretch of electron density that runs parallel to the LPC acyl tail was modeled as OLA (Figure 3b). Although the available electron density extends only up to carbon-12, proximity of its carboxylate group to the glycerol sn-2 hydroxyl of LPC and the fact that this structure is devoid of ordered resident fatty acids support this assignment. The presence of OLA was also unambiguously established at site I in monomers B and C of GM2AP3-PC (figures 3b, 4b). As shown in Figure 4b, three fatty acids are in stacking contact in binding site I of monomer B. They are in van der Waals' contact with the glycerol-3-phosphocholine group (PCH) (3.2-4.0 Å), although an electron density connection is lacking. Such ordering of lipid tails has been observed previously in the structures of liver fatty acid binding protein and lipovitellin (29, 30). A third binding location exists in the vicinity of the Y71 loop where ligand binding (MYR and PCH) appears to have an ordering effect on the flexible side chain of Tyr71. PCH binds in stacking contact with the aromatic side chain of Tyr71 in monomer C. A similar contact is observed in site I of monomer B where the phosphocholine moiety of LPC interacts with the side chain of Tyr137 (see Figures 3b and 4b). 4. Structure Comparisons. The R-carbon backbone folds of GM2AP1-PC, GM2AP2-PC and GM2AP3-PC are compared in Figure 1. They are examples of both the open and the closed conformations of the molecule. Pairwise structural superpositions show average discrepancies > 1.0 Å except in those cases in which multiple copies within the asymmetric unit are compared (see Table 4). The largest differences are confined to three flexible loop regions: (1) the flexible peptide Pro124-Ser130 followed by the mobile W131 loop (Ser130-Thr133), controlling the entrance to the cleft; (2) the Y71 reverse turn (Thr69-Ile72) and (3) the helix-turn region (residues Phe80-Cys94). Movements in these regions affect the diameter of the pocket opening. Mobility of the first two regions has previously been described for the three independent monomers of the apo structure (3, 6). As shown in Figure 1, the lateral shifts of peptide Asp125-Leu128 occur in both the open and the closed structures. For instance, this strand is folded back by several angstroms in GM2AP1-PC, which has a wide open cleft, and in the closed structure of monomer C of GM2AP3-PC. Shifts in the Y71 loop are small, although the side chains of Asp70 and Tyr71 are very flexible.

Figure 2 illustrates the strong degree of overlap of bound lipid in the three PC complexes, although their identity at specific locations varies among the structures. 2. Binding Locations for lyso-PC. LPC was found to occupy the same two sites within the hydrophobic pocket as observed for PAF in the GM2AP-PAF complex (14). Its identity was unambiguously established through the characteristic electron density features for its phosphocholine headgroup and location near polar side chains. The most highly and consistently occupied region of the binding pocket in both the open and the closed structures is that of binding site II. Here, LPC is deeply immersed inside the pocket. It is represented by strong electron density (Figure 3a) with its headgroup bound in the vicinity of the side chains of Ser141, Phe80, Phe109, and Tyr114. However, its bound conformation as well as its position differs in the structures of GM2AP2-PC and GM2AP3-PC. The headgroups are shifted by several angstroms with respect to one another and the alkyl chains extend along different directions. In GM2AP2PC the acyl tail is nestled against the R-helix with its distal end extending away from the protein surface, while in GM2AP3-PC it remains in van der Waals' contact with other alkyl chains within the pocket (see Figures 3b and 4a). Binding site I is occupied in those structures in which the W131 mobile loop is flipped out and the hydrophobic cleft is open (monomers A and B of GM2AP3-PC, and GM2AP1PC) (Figure 4a). Since this cleft is believed to serve as lipid transfer channel, occupancy may be transitional (6). As described for the PAF complex (14), where the open conformation is seen in all three monomers (A,B,C), the positively charged phosphocholine headgroup is immobilized through stacking contact with Tyr137 and several nonpolar side chains on either side of the cleft (Leu55, Ile66, Ile72, Leu126, Leu128, Leu132) (see Figure 4b). It is interesting to note that a nonpolar environment is also observed for the phosphocholine headgroup in the PC complex of the human PC transfer protein (15). The available electron density for LPC is continuous only in monomer A. In monomer B, a gap at the sn-1 acyl bond suggests either conformational disorder or enzymatic cleavage of the oleate group (Figure 4b). It is worth noting that a gap in the electron density along the acyl tail, consistently observed for LPC and OLA, coincides with the unsaturated bond C9dC10. Since it is well-known that unsaturated lipids are susceptible to oxidation (28), this may reflect limited cleavage of some of the oleate chains.

The previously unobserved conformational change in the helix-turn region is seen in the structures of GM2AP2-PC, Y137S-PC, and GM2AP1-PC. The R-helix takes up a new

position as a result of an outward rotation of its helical axis by 30-40° and strand separation of -strands 4 and 5 due to loss of the outer hydrogen bond between Leu49 and Phe80.

In view of nonpolar contacts of several of the helix side chains with the LPC acyl tail, this conformational change may be due to lipid binding.

5. Importance of Tyr137 for Ligand Binding. The importance of Tyr137 for phospholipid binding was investigated by introducing a serine mutation. Tyr137 is located in a strategic position at the entrance of the cleft (Figure 2), providing stabilizing interactions for both the open and the closed conformations of the mobile W131 loop and for the phospholipid headgroup in GM2AP3-PC and GM2AP-PAF (14). Although the crystals of Y137S obtained after incubation with PC were not as highly ordered as those of wildtype GM2AP, structure analysis at 2.2 Å resolution clearly showed significant rearrangements in the region of the disordered strand and at the W131 loop (Ser130-Thr134). As illustrated in Figure 5b, the W131 loop has adopted a new conformation as a result of the serine mutation. Both Trp131 and Lys57 take up new positions due to loss of their van der

Waals' contact with the aromatic ring of Tyr137. The indole ring of Trp131 is in a more exposed position relative to that observed in GM2AP2-PC and Lys57 forms new hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl groups of Thr134 and Glu58. The side chains of Thr133 and Thr134 have shifted into new positions due to changes in the dihedral angles of the peptide region Leu132-Thr134. The flexible peptide Asp125-Pro129 moved inward making contact across the cleft with the side chain of Ile72 (see Figure 5a). Electron density features inside the pocket are patchy and were modeled as eight 2-propanol molecules in monomer A. Neither PC nor LPC are seen bound in binding position II near Ser141 and at the Y71 loop, where the side chains of Asp70 and Tyr71 are partly disordered. Only one stretch of electron density indicated fatty acid binding. It is located in monomer B and coincides with the general position of OLA in GM2AP2-PC (see Figure 5a). 6. Mouse-GM2AP: Example of a Low pH Closed Structure. The most interesting feature of the mouse-GM2AP structure is its overall compact fold and constricted cavity opening (10 Å diameter) relative to the closed crystal structures of human GM2AP3-PC and GM2AP2-PC (Figure 6). Sequence comparisons show that the flexible chain segment Asp125-Thr134 and many of the hydrophobic residues inside the pocket are completely conserved. Moreover, the apolar character of the exposed reverse turn Val59-Trp63,

thought to interact with membrane bilayers (6), is further enhanced in mouse-GM2AP by replacement of Leu62 with Phe. The Y71 reverse turn has a series of mutations (D70E, Y71Q, and I72L), which probably accounts for the specificity differences between human and mouse GM2AP for the GM2 carbohydrate moiety (6, 18). Interpretation of the electron density map revealed fragmented electron density inside the pocket in similar position as found in the structure of human GM2AP3-PC (monomer C). This density was tentatively modeled as three fatty acid molecules with alkyl chains 12-14 carbons in length (MYR, LAU) (see Figure 6). As also observed in the structures of human apo-GM2AP (3) and SapB (4), this lipid material copurified from the inclusion bodies and may be required for structural stability. When the three fatty acid molecules were oriented with their carboxylate groups at the high-density end, favorable interactions with aromatic side chains and hydroxyl groups (Tyr87, Phe62, Ser141) became possible (Figure 6). 7. Analysis of Phospholipase A ActiVity. LPC is generated through cleavage of the sn-2 acyl bond of PC. The crystallographic evidence for LPC suggests that the type of enzymatic activity associated with GM2AP is reminiscent of that of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Two independent assays were performed to analyze this observed activity in solution. First, LPC production was monitored enzymatically over a

2-50 h period making use of the specificity properties of autotaxin, a lyso-phospholipase D enzyme that uses LPC, but not 18:1 PC as substrate (31). Lyso-PLD releases choline from LPC, converting it to lyso-phosphatidic acid. Figure 7 exhibits the time course of LPC production in terms of choline release. The reaction reaches a plateau at 36 h of incubation, which may indicate substrate depletion. Control experiments show that no LPC is produced (i) when GM2AP is absent in the reaction mixture and (ii) when PC is incubated in the presence of either 2% -octylglucoside or 0.1% Triton X-100. This eliminates the possibility that LPC is produced by a general detergent effect. Both detergents do not affect the activity of autotaxin to hydrolyze LPC. In the second assay, the release of free fatty acid products was measured directly in a sensitive fluorescence assay in which GM2AP was incubated with varying amounts of the fluorescent lipid PED6. PED6 serves as a sensitive probe to measure cleavage at the sn-2 glycerol ester bond. It is a modified phosphatidylethanolamine lipid with a palmitate substitution at the sn-1 position. Fluorescent moieties present at the sn-2 acyl tail and at the headgroup self-quench in the intact molecule. Figure 8a illustrates the kinetics of fatty acid release from the sn-2 acyl position as a function of substrate concentration (0.05-50 µM), showing typical sigmoidal behavior. Under these assay conditions, PED6 binds to GM2AP with a binding constant of 1.33 µM. As apparent

Enzyme concentration is 0.01 mg/mL in 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer. 2 reaction was carried out without CaCl2; 9 reaction mixture contains 10 mM CaCl2. Fluorescent measurements were made at 475 and 525 nm. (b) pH dependence of the hydrolysis of PED6. Each of the three conditions was tested with and without the addition of GM2AP. Values measured are relative fluorescence intensity.

from Figure 8b, the enzyme activity has a pH maximum of pH 6.0, contrasting with the pH 8 maxima observed for outer membrane phospholipase A of E. coli (OMPLA) (32, 33) and many mammalian PLA2 enzymes (34, 35). The enzyme efficiency with and without added calcium chloride can be deduced from Figure 8a. In contrast to other calciumdependent PLA2 enzymes, it is interesting to note that the presence of calcium has no effect or even inhibits the esterase activity at higher substrate concentrations. In a control experiment, using the same conditions, cobra toxin exhibits no enzymatic activity at pH 6.0 in the absence of calcium. However, in the presence of calcium it shows a 20 times

GM2-Activator Phospholipid Complexes weaker binding constant (Km ) 20µM) and a much greater turnover rate in comparison to GM2AP. While the catalytic rate of the observed enzyme activity is low in comparison to members of the PLA2 enzyme family, it has unique properties showing a pH maximum at pH 6.0 and no increase in activity in the presence of calcium. The same observations were made for the glycosylated human form of GM2AP expressed in SF9 cells (data not shown), ruling out the possibility of a bacterial contaminant. DISCUSSION The structural data presented here, demonstrating that GM2AP can (i) bind multiple single chain phospholipids and fatty acids in its large binding pocket and (ii) hydrolytically modify phospholipids, suggests possibilities for yet unrecognized functions of GM2AP. For example, the combined effects of hydrolase activity coupled with lipid transport properties could provide a means of delivery of specific hydrolysis products to their target sites. Lyso-phospholipids and certain fatty acids are well-known to act as mediators in the complex area of cellular signaling and lipid metabolism. Hydrolase activity may also explain the inhibiting effect of GM2AP on PAF-induced disease processes, as these may simply be the result of enzymatic modification of PAF to nontoxic lyso-PAF. The large lipophilic pocket, allowing low specificity binding of a heterogeneous mixture of lipids and their easy exchange, contrasts with the well-defined binding site architecture of other phospholipid binding proteins (15, 36, 37). For instance, lipid complexes of the lipid presenting mouse protein CD1d show the acyl chains bound in narrow channels (37). The ligands are thought to bind with high affinity (< micromolar), remaining bound until they can be released for further processing. Moreover, resident (endogenous) fatty acids that occupy the large pocket of GM2AP, as found in human and mouse apo-GM2AP and Y137S-PC, appear to have two functions. One is to maintain structural integrity of the protein fold, as also suggested for CD1b. The second one, as observed in our crystal structures, is its ability to attract and stabilize added lipid through nonpolar stacking interactions of their lipid tails. Lipid bound inside the cleft region of the molecule, as observed in several crystal structures, suggests that this hydrophobic cleft may serve as a convenient channel to transfer lipid from the membrane to the hydrophobic pocket (6, 14). To assess factors required for successful transfer, the importance of Tyr137 was considered because of its dual function. Replacement of its side chain by a serine hydroxyl group would (i) eliminate stacking with the phospholipid headgroup and (ii) destabilize the two alternate conformations of the mobile W131 loop (6). It was proposed that this loop acts as a flexible gate to the hydrophobic cleft, thus facilitating access of lipid to the binding pocket (6). Lipid entry would be permitted when it is flipped out exposing Trp131, and blocked when it is turned in with the indole ring of Trp131 roughly taking up the position of the phospholipid headgroup. The conformational state of this loop is not a function of pH, as both conformations are observed in the low and high pH structures. Replacement of Tyr137 by serine not only resulted in formation of a new crystal form but also affected mobility

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 41, 2005 13519 and structural integrity of the W131 loop (Figure 5b). In addition, it caused closure of the cleft as a result of an inward shift of the disordered strand Asp125-Leu128. The absence of lipid inside the binding pocket and near Tyr71 further supports the view that the cleft acts as a transfer channel. We infer from analysis of this mutant structure that both the open and the closed conformations of the cleft are essential for lipid entry and transfer. The tyrosyl side chain of Tyr137 is crucial for structural integrity of the open conformation necessary to allow lipid entry. Hydrolytic activity associated with GM2AP was suggested previously based on structure analysis of GM2AP-PAF (14). This structure revealed binding of intact PAF in the hydrophobic cleft of all three monomers in the asymmetric unit and lyso-PAF in binding site II. Although both PAF and PC are susceptible to auto-oxidation, it is unlikely that LPC and lyso-PAF would be produced at high enough concentrations for binding. As verified by mass spectrometry analysis, neither lyso-PAF nor LPC could be detected among a series of breakdown products in samples of both lipids stored at room temperature in aqueous solution for several days. Identification of glycero-3-phosphocholine in two monomers of GM2AP3-PC suggests, in addition, that cleavage had occurred to a lesser extent at the sn-1 ester bond of PC. Thus, the enzyme activity resembles that of the wellknown enzymes PLA2 and PLA1. The phospholipase A enzymes encompass a large structurally diverse family of proteins found both extracellularly and intracellularly in the cytosol (34, 35). Their biological significance lies to a large extent in their ability to generate hydrolysis products that can act as second messengers in cellular signaling processes. These enzymes vary in their calcium and pH dependence and in the structural features of their active sites (Ser-HisAsp or Ser-Arg-Asp). For many it has been shown that they act at the lipid/water interface and require dimerization (38). A similar mechanism could apply to GM2AP. However, we have as yet not been able to identify the hydrolytic site on the protein surface. Assuming that the putative active site contains a His residue, the two histidines in the molecule (His79 and His106) are exposed on the surface near the N-terminal end of the single R-helix. However, there is no clear evidence for a catalytic triad as required for successful hydrolysis. Several Asp residues in the vicinity can only interact with the imidazole rings through water mediated contacts. It is possible that other factors, such as dimerization, are required for successful catalysis. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that incubation of GM2AP with 18:1 PC results in a heterogeneous mixture of stable protein lipid complexes. Three different crystal forms were analyzed, containing one, two, and three monomers per asymmetric unit. Each structure shows distinct structural features with respect to lipid binding and flexibility of loop regions. The available nonprotein electron density inside the apolar pocket is insufficient to suggest that intact PC is bound, although it could easily be spatially accommodated. It was modeled as LPC, PCH, and OLA thought to constitute deacylation products of PC, and other smaller fatty acids. The presence of LPC in the incubation mixture with PC was verified by mass spectrometry and by an enzymatic assay that uses LPC as substrate. Direct evidence for enzymatic activity was

13520 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 41, 2005 further obtained from a fluorescence assay that uses a PLA2specific fluorescent lipid. The hydrolase activity was found to have a pH maximum at pH 6.0 and does not require calcium. The presence of calcium lowers the binding constant and causes weak inhibition. In agreement with earlier studies (14), binding locations I (cleft area) and II (inside pocket) are occupied by LPC and/ or fatty acids in the "open" structures. The "closed" structures of GM2AP2-PC and GM2AP3-PC (monomer C) exhibit LPC binding only in site II near Ser141 and fatty acid binding near Tyr71 and Phe121 (Figure 3b). Although lipid binding was found not to be identical in all complexes, taken together the positions of the alkyl chains coincide to a large extent and site II is preferentially occupied. Short chain fatty acids may represent resident fatty acids that become ordered through nonpolar stacking interactions with bound incoming ligand. Supporting evidence for the putative functional role of the hydrophobic cleft as lipid transfer channel was obtained from the structure of mutant Y137S. While its overall structure is similar to that of GM2AP2-PC, absence of lipid inside the pocket suggests that the conformational change in the W131 mobile loop, caused by the mutation, may lock the cleft into a permanently closed conformation, blocking lipid entry.
