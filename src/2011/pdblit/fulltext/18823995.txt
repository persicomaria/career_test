The kinase autophosphorylates at a conserved His residue, and the response regulator catalyzes transfer of the phosphate to its own conserved Asp side chain, with the level of phosphorylated response regulator ultimately determining the strength of the output response. In some cases, histidine kinase signaling pathways consist of multiple components that catalyze alternating HisAsp phosphotransfers. In Bacillus subtilis, the onset of sporulation-specific gene expression is tightly controlled by such a phosphorelay (Burbulys et al., 1991). The sporulation phosphorelay begins when histidine kinases (primarily KinA and KinB) autophosphorylate at a conserved His. The phosphate group is subsequently transferred to an Asp on Spo0F and then to a His on Spo0B. In the final step, phosphate transfer to an Asp on the transcriptional regulator Spo0A (the response regulator) causes it to become activated. Histidine kinase signaling pathways are often regulated by signals other than those that directly activate the kinase (Sonenshein, 2000; Stock et al., 2000). This allows cells to integrate disparate signals to exert fine control over a particular cellular response. Phosphatases are commonly deployed to dephosphorylate response regulators or related Asp-containing phosphotransfer proteins (Perego and Hoch, 1996), and several antikinases have been identified that inhibit specific histidine kinases through an interaction with their autokinase domain (Wang et al., 1997; Garnerone et al., 1999; Pioszak et al., 2000.). In response to defects in the initiation of DNA replication, B. subtilis prevents the onset of sporulation by using Sda to inhibit the Spo0A phosphorelay (Burkholder et al., 2001). KinA and KinB are the primary sources of phosphoryl groups for this phosphorelay during sporulation (Trach and Hoch, 1993; LeDeaux et al., 1995), and Sda exerts its effect by preventing the accumulation of phosphorylated KinA and probably also KinB (Burkholder et al., 2001). Sda is a 46 residue polypeptide with an amino acid sequence unlike any previously identified histidine kinase inhibitor. In this study, we determined the structure of Sda and examined how it regulates KinA. We show that Sda is an antikinase that binds the KinA phosphotransfer domain and acts as a molecular barricade that inhibits productive interaction between the ATP binding site and the phosphorylatable His residue. Results Sda Binds the KinA Autokinase Domain We used pull-down assays to delineate the region of KinA that is bound by Sda. KinA can be considered a three-domain protein, as depicted in Figure 1A. Residues 1­383 comprise the N-terminal sensor domain which contains three PAS sensor modules. The C-terminal autokinase domain of KinA comprises an ATP binding catalytic domain and a dimerization/histidine

Summary Histidine kinases are used extensively in prokaryotes to monitor and respond to changes in cellular and environmental conditions. In Bacillus subtilis, sporulation-specific gene expression is controlled by a histidine kinase phosphorelay that culminates in phosphorylation of the Spo0A transcription factor. Sda provides a developmental checkpoint by inhibiting this phosphorelay in response to DNA damage and replication defects. We show that Sda acts at the first step in the relay by inhibiting autophosphorylation of the histidine kinase KinA. The structure of Sda, which we determined using NMR, comprises a helical hairpin. A cluster of conserved residues on one face of the hairpin mediates an interaction between Sda and the KinA dimerization/phosphotransfer domain. This interaction stabilizes the KinA dimer, and the two proteins form a stable heterotetramer. The data indicate that Sda forms a molecular barricade that inhibits productive interaction between the catalytic and phosphotransfer domains of KinA. Introduction Histidine kinase signaling pathways are used extensively in bacteria to monitor and respond to signals that communicate information about environmental conditions, stage of development, and metabolic status (Dutta et al., 1999; Hoch, 2000; Robinson et al., 2000). They also regulate key environmental and developmental responses in archaea, eukaryotic microoganisms, and plants (Thomason and Kay, 2000). The cellular processes regulated by histidine kinases are diverse and include metabolic adaptation, chemotaxis, cell cycle progression, antibiotic resistance, and virulence.

Figure 1. Sda Forms a Stable Complex with the KinA DHp Domain (A) Cartoon of the domain architecture of KinA. (B) Sda (0.7 nmol) was incubated with naked Ni2 -NTA beads or with beads that had been decorated with full-length KinA autokinase domain (His6-KinA383­606), the KinA catalytic domain (His6-KinA456­606), or two different constructs encompassing the KinA DHp domain (His6-KinA383­460 and His6-KinA383­465). Each reaction contained 3.1 nmol KinA, assuming all KinA preincubated with beads was still bound at the time of Sda addition. Beads were incubated at ambient temperature for 1 hr, and then supernatant (lanes labeled "S") and bead-bound (lanes labeled "B") fractions were recovered and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue.

phosphotransfer (DHp) domain that contains the His405 autophosphorylation site (Wang et al., 2001). We immobilized His6-KinA383­606 (comprising both the catalytic domain and the DHp domain), His6-KinA456­606 (encompassing only the catalytic domain), and two slightly different constructs of the DHp domain (His6KinA383­465 and His6-KinA383­460) on Ni2 agarose beads and used them as bait in pull-down experiments with Sda. In these experiments (Figure 1B), any Sda which does not bind KinA remains in the supernatant (S), while bound Sda pellets with the beads (B). We found that Sda bound to beads decorated with the complete autokinase domain (Figure 1B, lanes 3 and 4) or either DHp domain construct (Figure 1B, lanes 7­10), but not by naked beads (Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 2) or beads decorated with catalytic domain (Figure 1B, lanes 5 and 6). The DHp domain was as effective as the entire autokinase domain in binding Sda. Thus, Sda appears to be the first example of an antikinase that interacts with a histidine kinase DHp domain. Sda Inhibits KinA Autophosphorylation We previously demonstrated that Sda inhibits accumulation of KinA P and Spo0F P (Burkholder et al., 2001). Sda could exert these effects by inhibiting KinA autophosphorylation, by acting as a phosphatase for KinA P, or by stimulating a latent autophosphatase activity of KinA. Additionally, Sda might block phosphate transfer from KinA P to Spo0F. We performed several experiments to discriminate between these mechanistic possibilities.

Full-length KinA autophosphorylates in the presence of -32P-labeled ATP (Figure 2A, lane 1), but this accumulation of KinA P was completely blocked by an 10fold molar excess of Sda (Figure 2A, lane 2). Sda also inhibited autophosphorylation by the KinA autokinase domain, indicating that the N-terminal sensor domain is not essential for the Sda-KinA interaction (data not shown). In contrast, we observed quantitative transfer of phosphate from KinA P to Spo0F when the two proteins were mixed (Figure 2B, lane 2), and this reaction was unaffected by Sda (Figure 2B, lane 3). We conclude that Sda blocks KinA autophosphorylation but does not inhibit phosphate transfer from KinA P to Spo0F. Next, we tested whether Sda stimulates dephosphorylation of KinA P. We found that purified KinA P was stable for at least 30 min in both the absence and presence of a 10-fold molar excess of Sda (Figure 2C, compare lanes 2 and 3); indeed, over a period of 30 min, we observed no release of inorganic phosphate in the presence or absence of Sda (data not shown). This rules out the possibility that Sda acts as a phosphatase for KinA P or that it stimulates a cryptic phosphatase activity of the autokinase domain, an activity that has been demonstrated for some histidine kinases such as EnvZ (Cai et al., 2003), FixL (Lois et al., 1993), and NRII/NtrB (Pioszak et al., 2000). Finally, we found that Sda blocked the reverse reaction (i.e., KinA P ADP  KinA ATP). In the presence of excess ADP, we observed robust transfer of phosphate from KinA P to ADP (Figures 2C and 2D, lane 4); this was expected, since the equilibrium for histidine

Figure 2. Regulation of KinA by Sda Assays were performed using full-length KinA, and levels of protein phosphorylation were monitored using SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. (A) Sda inhibits KinA autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation reactions contained KinA1­606-His6 ( 10 pmol), 0.5 mM -32P-labeled ATP, and the amounts of Sda indicated in pmol above the gel. The KinA1­606-His6 P preparation contains autophosphorylated degradation products that are seen as lower molecular weight bands in the autoradiograms. (B) Sda does not block phosphate transfer to Spo0F. KinA1­606-His6 32P ( 9 pmol) was premixed on ice with Sda (90 pmol) or Sda storage buffer prior to addition of kinase buffer alone or buffer containing 150 pmol Spo0F-His6. Quantitative transfer of 32P-phosphate to Spo0F was observed both in the absence and presence of Sda. (C and D) Sda inhibits the reverse reaction. KinA1­606-His6 32P ( 9 pmol) was premixed on ice with buffer A Sda ( 90 pmol). Reactions were started by addition of kinase buffer 1 mM ADP. To monitor formation of 32P-ATP in the reverse reaction, 1 l of each reaction mixture was spotted onto PEI-cellulose and developed in 0.8 M LiCl /0.8 M acetic acid, using 32P-ATP as a standard. The histogram in (D) shows the proportion of transferred phosphate (i.e., that released from KinA and bound to ATP) as a proportion of total phosphate (both ATP and KinA-bound) in each reaction. Each column in the histogram corresponds to the reaction in the lane above it in (C).

kinase autophosphorylation strongly favors the unphosphorylated protein (Jiang et al., 2000; Stock et al., 2000). Strikingly, however, the reverse reaction was strongly inhibited by Sda (Figures 2C and 2D, lane 5). We conclude that Sda shuts down the sporulation phosphorelay by inhibiting KinA autophosphorylation. Moreover, the fact that Sda blocks both autophosphorylation and the reverse reaction has important mechanistic implications. First, it indicates that Sda can bind phosphorylated KinA, even though it does not affect phosphate transfer from KinA P to Spo0F or the rate of KinA P dephosphorylation. Second, it indicates that Sda blocks all KinA reactions that require communication between the catalytic and DHp domains, whereas no other KinA reactions are affected. Three-Dimensional Structure of Sda In order to gain further insight into the mechanism of action of Sda, we determined its three-dimensional (3D) structure and used structure-directed mutagenesis to identify key functional residues. The solution structure was determined using 3D triple-resonance NMR techniques and is represented by an ensemble of 25 conformers selected on the basis of lowest residual restraint violations (Figure 3A). Because Sda is small, the heteronuclear NMR data were excellent, and as a result the structure is highly precise with a root mean square (rms) ° deviation of 0.13 0.05 A over the backbone atoms of the well-defined region (residues 5­42). There are no distance or dihedral angle restraint violations greater ° than 0.2 A and 3 , respectively, and 91% of the structurally ordered residues (5­42) lie in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. A full summary of structural statistics is given in Table 1. The Sda monomer is dominated by two helices comprising residues Asp6­Met19 (helix A) and Arg23­Arg35 (helix B) that are linked by a highly structured interhelix loop (residues Asn20­Asn22) to form a helical hairpin

(Figure 3B). The helices are antiparallel, and they pack against one another with a crossover angle of 30 . 1 HN-15N residual dipolar couplings measured from Sda samples aligned using Pf1 phage (Hansen et al., 2000) support the orientation of the helices in the calculated structures (data not shown). Residues Ser37­Val42, on the C-terminal side of helix B, fold back against the lower half of one face of the helices (the C-terminal face), burying several hydrophobic residues (Leu38, Ile41, and Ile42). Despite its small size, Sda is stabilized by numerous hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The helical interface is hydrophobic (Figure 3C) with the exception of an interhelical ion pair between Asp6 at the N-terminal end of helix A and Arg36 at the C-terminal end of helix B (Figure 3D). The individual helices are further stabilized by several intrahelical ion pairs (Marqusee and Baldwin, 1987) (Figure 3D). Many of the residues involved in these ion pairs (Asp6, Glu11, Lys15, Glu32, Arg36) are well conserved across Sda orthologs (Figure 3E). The extreme N and C termini of Sda are the least conserved regions of the protein (see Figure 3E), and the structure reveals that they are dynamic in solution; however, their structural disorder is limited by weak interactions with the helical hairpin. The -methyl group at the tip of the Met1 side chain makes NOE contacts with several hydrophobes (Phe25, Leu28, Ile29) on the N-terminal face of the helices, thus limiting the inherent disorder of Met1­Leu4. Similarly, the -methyl groups of Val44 make NOE contacts with Lys34 on the C-terminal face of the helices, limiting the disorder of Ser43­ Ser46. The hydrophobic core of Sda is formed by two sets of interactions. One set occurs at the interface between the two helices and involves Leu9, Tyr13, Ala16, Ile26, Ile29, and Ile33 (gray side chains in Figure 3C). The second set of interactions occurs between several residues on the C-terminal helical face (Ile10, one face of

(B) Schematic of the Sda structure showing location and orientation of helices. (C) The conserved hydrophobic core of Sda consists of interhelical interactions (gray side chains) and a second set of interactions between residues at the base of helix A and residues in the C-terminal region (light green side chains).

the Tyr13 aromatic ring, Phe14, and the -methyl group of Ile33) and Leu38, Ile41, and Ile42 in the C-terminal tail (pastel green side chains in Figure 3C). The side chains of Leu9, Ile10, Tyr13, Phe14, Ala16, Ile26, Ile29, Ile33, Leu38, and Ile42 are largely buried in this hydrophobic core, along with the -methyl groups of Thr17 and Ile41. The buried core residues are highly conserved across known Sda orthologs (Figure 3E), and, consequently, the tertiary structure of Sda is likely to be similar in all these bacteria.

Identification of Key Functional Residues in Sda Comparison of the primary structure of Sda orthologs (Figure 3E) allowed us to identify highly conserved surface-exposed residues in the structure of B. subtilis Sda. Remarkably, almost all of these residues are located on the N-terminal face of the helical hairpin (Figures 4A and 4B), suggesting that this region most likely contains the binding site for KinA. We mutagenized each of these conserved surface residues and assayed the ability of each mutant to inhibit KinA autophosphorylation (Figure

bic patch on the N-terminal surface of the helical hairpin (Figure 4C). The residues that appear to be most critical for Sda function, Leu21 and Phe25, are located in the center of this patch. Identification of KinA Binding Site on Sda We took two approaches to mapping the KinA binding site on Sda. First, we used pull-down assays to examine the ability of each Sda mutant to bind KinA. All mutants that were competent to inhibit KinA autophosphorylation were also able to bind KinA383­606 (Figure 4E). Mutant Sda proteins that exhibited a partial loss-of-function (M19I, M19A, and L28A) could still bind KinA383­606 in the pull-down assay, as could the total loss-of-function mutant L21A (Figure 4E). However, we suspect that more quantitative binding experiments are likely to reveal subtle KinA binding defects for these mutants, as shown below for L21A and M19I. L21E and F25H, two of the three mutants that were completely defective in blocking KinA autophosphorylation, showed defects in KinA binding (bottom right panel in Figure 4E). This suggests that Leu21 and Phe25 are major components of the KinA binding site. Next, we used NMR to examine the interaction between Sda and the KinA DHp domain (KinA383­465). When unlabeled DHp domain was added to an equimolar solution of 15N-labeled Sda, the suppression of HSQC crosspeak intensity was so severe that chemical shift changes could not be determined; however, the experiment provided unequivocal evidence for an interaction between Sda and the 20 kDa DHp dimer. Although crosspeak intensity was suppressed by an average of 60% when DHp domain was added at a molar ratio of 1:2.7 (Figure 5A), chemical shift perturbations could be monitored for most Sda residues, and they were greatest for Ser12, Lys15, Leu21, Asn22, Asp24, and Phe25 (Figure 5B). These residues form a spatially contiguous cluster centered around Leu21 and Phe25 on the N-terminal surface of the Sda hairpin (red in Figure 5C). Ser12, Lys15, and Asp24, which are spatially adjacent to Leu21 and Phe25, undergo significant shift perturbations in the NMR experiment. However, they are unlikely to be key binding residues since the S12A, K15A, and D24A mutants exhibited no defects in autophosphorylation and binding assays. Similarly, although Asn22 suffers a major chemical shift perturbation upon DHp binding, this likely reflects proximity to the binding site rather than a direct role in KinA binding since this residue is poorly conserved across Sda orthologs (Figure 3E). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Asn22 plays a role in KinA binding. Note that the C-terminal residues suffered the smallest shift perturbations, consistent with Sda contacting KinA solely via the N-terminal face of the hairpin. Addition of DHp domain caused the crosspeak intensity for several N-terminal residues (Arg2­Ser5) to be reduced to baseline levels. It is impossible to ascertain whether the relative suppression of crosspeak intensity was more severe than observed for other residues, since these crosspeaks were weak even prior to addition of DHp. However, as noted previously, the -methyl group of Met1 makes NOE contacts with Phe25 and Leu28 in the unbound conformation of Sda, and this interaction

4D). Mutants E32A and R36A were insoluble and were excluded from further analysis. These residues form part of a conserved ion-pair network (see Figure 3D) which might be critical for proper folding of Sda. Most mutants (L8K, E11A, S12A, K15A, E18A, M19L, D24A, R35E, and S45A) were equivalent to wild-type Sda in their ability to inhibit KinA autophosphorylation, whereas several mutants (M19A, M19I, and L28A) showed a partial loss of inhibitory activity. Of most interest were four mutants (L21A, L21E, F25A, and F25H) that showed a complete loss of function. All but one of the soluble Sda mutants were correctly folded. We assessed folding competency by comparing the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of each 15N-labeled mutant protein with that of wild-type Sda (data not shown). The HSQC spectrum is a structural fingerprint that contains a single crosspeak for each backbone amide proton. Changes in the backbone fold of a protein alters the electronic environment of these atoms and perturbs their chemical shift in the HSQC spectrum. The HSQC spectrum of all but one mutant protein was similar to that of wild-type Sda, with only minor chemical shift perturbations for residues proximal to the mutation site. However, the HSQC spectrum of F25A was vastly different from that of wild-type Sda, indicating that this mutant is misfolded. We conclude that only L21A, L21E, and F25H are true loss-of-function mutants, while M19A, M19I, and L28A are partial loss-of-function mutants. Remarkably, the four residues affected by these mutations, Met19, Leu21, Phe25 and Leu28, form a contiguous hydropho-

is likely to be perturbed upon DHp binding. This might alter the conformation of the relatively flexible N-terminal segment (Met1­Ser5), which could lead to signifi-

cant peak suppression for these residues in the presence of a substoichiometric amount of DHp. We conclude that the hydrophobic surface patch

formed by Leu21 and Phe25 represents the primary site for interaction of Sda with the KinA DHp domain. These residues are conserved in all Sda orthologs (Figure 3E). Sda Enhances KinA Dimerization We examined whether Sda alters KinA oligomerization (Figure 5), since KinA is only active as a homodimer. Although the C-terminal sensor domain facilitates KinA dimerization, the autokinase domain still homodimerizes in the absence of the PAS modules (Wang et al., 2001). As for other histidine kinases, autophosphorylation is presumed to occur in trans, with one monomer phosphorylating its partner in the dimer (Ninfa et al., 1993;

Qin et al., 2000). Thus, a plausible explanation for the ability of Sda to block both the autophosphorylation and reverse reaction is that it induces dissociation of the KinA homodimer. Proteins were fractionated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and molecular masses were estimated using multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS). Note that, unlike SEC, the molecular mass estimated using MALLS is independent of protein shape and is unaffected by protein interactions with the column matrix. Sda alone yielded a single peak with an estimated 0.4 kDa weight-average molecular mass (MW) of 6.0 (Figure 5D, trace A). This is close to the theoretical mass

Molecular Cell 696

of an Sda monomer (5.6 kDa), indicating that Sda is primarily monomeric under these conditions. When applied alone to the column, the KinA autokinase domain eluted as two peaks (Figure 5D, trace B). The peak with shortest retention time (RT 20.5 min) 1.5 kDa, which is close to had an MW value of 56.1 the estimated mass of a KinA383­606 dimer (54.4 kDa). We conclude that the early-eluting peak corresponds to KinA dimer. The later eluting peak (RT 23 min) had an MW value of 31.0 1.2 kDa, slightly higher than the estimated mass of a KinA383­606 monomer (27.2 kDa). However, because of its proximity to the dimer peak, the estimated mass will be biased toward higher MW by trailing dimers that overlap the monomer peak. We therefore conclude that this peak corresponds to KinA383­606 monomer. On the basis of the relative intensity of the two peaks, we estimate that the KinA autokinase domain is about 50% dimer/50% monomer under the chosen experimental conditions. If Sda functions by disrupting the KinA dimer, then one would predict an increase in relative intensity of the KinA monomer peak if increasing amounts of Sda were added to a fixed concentration of KinA. We observed precisely the opposite. As Sda was added to KinA383­606, the intensity of the dimer peak increased at the expense of monomer (Figure 5D, traces C­F). At approximately equimolar concentrations of KinA383­606 and Sda (Figure 5D, trace E), most of the KinA was converted to dimer. This indicates not only that Sda enhances KinA dimerization but that the binding affinity must be high. The small amount of apparently monomeric KinA at a 5-fold excess of Sda (Figure 5D, trace F) is probably either a contaminant or dimerization-incompetent KinA383­606 because we were unable to convert it to dimer using a 10-fold excess of Sda (data not shown). Note that the KinA "dimer" peak shifts to shorter retention time as more Sda is added. This shift in retention time would be expected if Sda bound tightly to KinA to form a stable heteromeric complex with higher mass than the KinA dimer. At a 5-fold excess of Sda (Figure 5F), the estimated mass of the Sda:KinA383­606 complex is 66.7 0.5 kDa, which is close to the predicted mass of a KinA dimer with two molecules of bound Sda (65.6 kDa). Thus, Sda and KinA appear to form a heterotetramer comprising two molecules of each protein. This 1:1 stoichiometry is consistent with the observation that the KinA monomer is quantitatively converted to dimer when equimolar amounts of Sda and KinA383­606 are mixed (Figure 5D, trace E). The F25H mutant, which failed to bind KinA in pulldown assays, also failed to affect KinA dimerization, even when added in 5-fold molar excess (Figure 5E, trace B). L21E behaved similarly (data not shown). Interestingly, while L21A appeared to bind KinA normally in pull-down assays (Figure 4E), MALLS revealed a binding defect. Whereas wild-type Sda fully bound to an equimolar amount of KinA and converted all KinA monomer to dimer (Figure 5E, trace D), an equimolar quantity of L21A failed to convert all KinA monomer to dimer, and a proportion of the L21A remained unbound; this weaker binding manifests as a reduced shift in retention time of the KinA dimer peak relative to the shift induced by wild-type Sda (compare traces C and D in Figure 5E). This binding defect presumably reflects an in-

creased off-rate for KinA binding, which might explain why L21A does not inhibit KinA autophosphorylation. M19I showed a similar binding defect to L21A in the MALLS assay, whereas L28A behaved similarly to wildtype Sda (not shown). Thus, the MALLS data indicate that Met19, Leu21, and Phe25 all contribute to the Sda:KinA interaction. We conclude that Sda binds the DHp domain of KinA via a cluster of conserved hydrophobic residues (Met19, Leu21, Phe25, and possibly Leu28) and that this interaction enhances KinA homodimerization. This contrasts with several organic compounds isolated in a chemical screen for KinA inhibitors which appear to intercalate into the four-helix bundle of the DHp domain in a manner that disrupts the dimer and promotes aggregation of KinA monomers (Stephenson et al., 2000). Discussion Sda Disrupts Communication between KinA Domains Our observation that Sda blocks both autophosphorylation and the reverse reaction (i.e., transfer of phosphate from KinA P to ADP) indicates that the primary lesion caused by Sda is defective communication between the ATP binding site in the catalytic domain and the phosphorylatable His in the DHp domain. The model that best explains these results is that Sda forms a molecular barricade between the catalytic and DHp domains of KinA, thus preventing interdomain communication. This mechanism is consistent with Sda blocking both the autophosphorylation and reverse reaction, and, as outlined below, it can explain how Sda stabilizes the KinA dimer. The catalytic and DHp domains of histidine kinases are separated by a flexible hinge which is thought to facilitate kinase function by allowing the autokinase module to exist in "open" and "closed" conformations. The closed conformation is thought to bring the nucleotide binding site on one monomer into close proximity with the phosphorylatable His on the other monomer during the autophosphorylation and reverse reaction. These regions are presumed to be further separated in the open conformation to provide room for docking of the cognate response regulator. To the best of our knowledge, no structures are available of an intact autokinase domain, with the exception of the unorthodox CheA histidine kinase which has a different domain organization from KinA (Bilwes et al., 1999). However, Inouye and coworkers (Cai et al., 2003) recently derived a model of the complete EnvZ autokinase fragment (EnvZ-AK) by using targeted disulfide crosslinking to determine the relative orientation of the experimentally determined structures of the separate catalytic (Tanaka et al., 1998) and DHp (Tomomori et al., 1999) domains. NMR studies revealed a dynamic relationship between the EnvZ catalytic and DHp domains (Cai et al., 2003), but targeted disulfide linking specifically captures the conformation in which these domains are in close proximity. Thus, the modeled EnvZAK structure (Figure 6B; PDB code 1NJV) presumably represents the closed conformation of the autokinase fragment that is associated with autophosphorylation.

Molecular Cell 698

EnvZ is a type 1A histidine kinase and its H box, ATP binding site, and hinge length are similar to that of KinA and other type I histidine kinases. Although the autokinase domains of EnvZ and KinA are only 21% identical, the extent of similarity is 49% when conservative replacements are considered (Figure 6A). Thus, for the purposes of the following discussion, the modeled EnvZ-AK structure is a good surrogate for the structure of the KinA autokinase module. The EnvZ-AK structure (Figure 6B) indicates that in the closed conformation the ATP binding face of the catalytic domain packs against two helices of the DHp domain, one provided by each monomer. The ATP binding site on one monomer is located close to the phosphorylatable His on the other monomer, but distal to the corresponding His on the same polypeptide chain, thus explaining why autophosphorylation occurs in trans. In this study we showed that Sda binds KinA P but does not block phosphate transfer from the DHp domain to Spo0F. This indicates that Sda and Spo0F can bind simultaneously to nonoverlapping sites on the DHp domain. Although no structure is available of the KinASpo0F complex, we can infer the Spo0F binding site on the KinA DHp domain from other studies. The crystal structure of the Spo0F-Spo0B complex (Zapf et al., 2000) indicates that Spo0F binds at the hairpin end of the four-helix bundle formed by the Spo0B dimer (Figure 6C). The two proteins dock so that the Spo0F activesite Asp is perfectly positioned for phosphotransfer to the phosphorylatable His on Spo0B. The Spo0F contact surface extends from just above the His residue to the end of the Spo0B hairpin. Although no structure is available of the complex between EnvZ and its cognate response regulator, OmpR, NMR chemical shift mapping experiments (Tomomori et al., 1999) showed that it binds to the hairpin end of the EnvZ DHp domain in a manner analogous to docking of Spo0F to the Spo0B (Figure 6D). Thus, the Spo0F-Spo0B structure reveals a common mode of docking of response regulators to the four-helix bundle of DHp domains (Varughese, 2002). Alignment of KinA383­460 with Spo0B (Figure 6E) reveals that, although the overall similarity is low, the Spo0B residues that contact Spo0F (see Table 1 in Zapf et al., 2000) are remarkably well conserved in KinA. Thus, Spo0F most likely binds KinA in a manner similar to its interaction with Spo0B, which enables us to pinpoint the Spo0F binding site on KinA to residues 402­444 of the DHp domain (Figures 6E and 6F). Since Sda binds KinA383­460, its contact surface must be restricted to residues 383­401 and 445­460 (Figure 6E), since its binding site cannot overlap with that of Spo0F for the reasons outlined above. Thus, the Sda binding site is contained within 35 residues that encompass the linker between the DHp and sensor domains, the linker-proximal end of the four-helix bundle, and the autokinase domain linker (Figure 6F). Sda is a small protein and molecular modeling studies using EnvZ-AK as a surrogate for KinA indicate that it could either lodge under the linker region at the top of the DHp domain (Figure 6G), or bind exclusively within the linker region (Figure 6H). This interaction is presumably mediated by the hydrophobic cluster delineated in our mutagenesis and NMR studies (Figure 4C). Note that the ATP binding face of the catalytic domain

packs against two helices of the DHp domain, one provided by each monomer (Figure 6F). Thus, if Sda bound across the intermonomer face of the four-helix bundle such that it made contact with 1 of one monomer and 2 of the other monomer (Figure 6G), it might be expected that Sda would stabilize the KinA dimer, as we observed experimentally. An alternative possibility is that Sda stabilizes the KinA dimer by binding the autokinase domain linker of one monomer and the linker to the sensor domain on the other monomer (Figure 6H). Regardless of its exact mode of binding, we propose that Sda acts as a molecular barricade that stabilizes an open conformation of the KinA autokinase domain, thus precluding close contact of His405 with the ATP binding site on the catalytic domain. This would explain why Sda blocks both autophosphorylation and the reverse reaction, but not phosphotransfer to Spo0F. If our hypothesis about the molecular basis of Sda function is correct, then cocrystallization of a Sda:KinA-AK complex might provide a unique opportunity to obtain the structure of an orthodox autokinase fragment, since Sda binding might eliminate the dynamic relationship between the catalytic and DHp domains. Comparison with Other Antikinases Sda appears to have a very different mechanism of action from that of PII and GlnK, two homologous inhibitors of the NRII/NtrB histidine kinase. PII/GlnK form large homotrimers or mixed heterotrimers that bind the NRII/ NtrB catalytic domain (Pioszak et al., 2000). The active form of the PII/GlnK trimer inhibits NRII/NtrB autophosphorylation and activates its phosphatase activity toward NRI/NtrC P (Jiang and Ninfa, 1999). The antikinase activity of Sda appears to be functionally analogous to KipI inhibition of KinA (Wang et al., 1997) and probably also inhibition of the FixL sensor kinase by FixT (Garnerone et al., 1999). However, the molecular details of these kinase-antikinase interactions are likely to be significantly different, as KipI (26.7 kDa) and FixT (12.2 kDa) are larger that Sda, the proteins share no amino acid sequence similarity, and, in contrast to Sda, a single FixT monomer appears to bind each FixL dimer (Garnerone et al., 1999). Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see whether each of these antikinases acts by blocking communication between the kinase catalytic and DHp domains. A New Paradigm for Histidine Kinase Inhibitors? Histidine kinase signaling pathways are attractive antimicrobial targets, largely because of their role in mediating antibiotic resistance and expression of virulence-associated factors (Matsushita and Janda, 2002; Stephenson and Hoch, 2002) and their absence from the animal kingdom (Thomason and Kay, 2000). In recent years, much effort has been expended in screening chemical libraries for small-molecule inhibitors of histidine kinases. For the most part, lead compounds from these screens have proved disappointing (Stephenson and Hoch, 2002). A more rational approach might be to develop mimics of endogenous histidine kinase inhibitors. However, prior to this study, the only available structure of such an inhibitor was that of PII and its homolog GlnK (Xu et al., 1998). PII/GlnK are large trimeric molecules that are

Structure and Mechanism of the Sda Antikinase 699

allosterically regulated by various ligands, and the molecular mechanism by which they alter NRII kinase activity is uncertain (Pioszak et al., 2000). Thus, at least at the present time, they are not useful templates for medicinal chemistry. Sda, on the other hand, might establish a new paradigm for rational design of histidine kinase inhibitors. First, Sda inhibits its cognate histidine kinase via a mechanism that has not been explored by medicinal chemists. Second, Sda is the smallest antikinase protein discovered to date, making it a tractable template for rational design. This study has provided a first glimpse of the Sda pharmacophore, and it appears to be restricted to a small hydrophobic cluster on one face of the protein. The successful design of small mimetics based on more complicated, discontinuous binding epitopes (Gadek et al., 2002) suggests that it should be possible to use the Sda pharmacophore as a template for rational design of histidine kinase inhibitors.
Experimental Procedures Cloning B. subtilis sda was PCR amplified using primers encoding 3 BamHI and 5 EcoRI sites. The gene for Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST) was PCR amplified using a 3 primer encoding an NcoI site and a 5 primer encoding BamHI and thrombin cleavage sites. After digestion with relevant restriction enzymes the two fragments were inserted into NcoI/EcoRI-digested pET28a to create plasmid pSLR65 which encodes a GST-Sda fusion with an intervening thrombin cleavage site. We used a similar approach to produce pSLR70 which encodes a GST-sda fusion with codons modified for optimal expression in E. coli. Sda mutants were produced by overlap-extension PCR of GST-sda using pSLR65 or pSLR70 as template. Plasmid pBB202 was produced by ligating NdeI/EcoRI-digested pET28b to a PCR product encompassing codons 383­606 of B. subtilis kinA flanked 5 by an NdeI site and 3 by a TAA stop codon and EcoRI site. This construct encodes KinA383­606 preceded by residues MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM; the encoded thrombin cleavage site (underlined) was not used during purification, so KinA remained His-tagged. Plasmids encoding His6-KinA456­606, His6KinA383­460, and His6-KinA383­465 were constructed similarly. Protein Production GST-Sda fusion proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21( DE3). Uniformly labeled proteins for NMR studies were obtained by growing cells in vitamin-supplemented M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl and [U-13C]glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Fusion proteins were purified using GSH affinity chromatography. Sda was liberated from GST by on-column thrombin cleavage, and then purified to 98% homogeneity using SEC. Sda proteins contained a vestigial N-terminal Gly-Ser from the thrombin cleavage site. Sda was dialyzed against buffer B (50 mM NaPi, 300 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 [pH 7.9]) for MALLS experiments. Full length, C-terminal His6-tagged KinA and Spo0F (KinA1­606-His6 and Spo0F-His6) were produced as described (Burkholder et al., 2001). His6-KinA383­606 was expressed from pBB202 in E. coli BL21( DE3) and purified using His-bind Ni2 resin. The eluted protein was judged to be 99% pure based on Coomassie-stained SDSPAGE gels. Other His6-KinA constructs were expressed and purified similarly. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). Pull-Down Assays Ni-NTA resin equilibrated in buffer A (20 mM NaPi, 100 mM NaCl [pH 7.6]) was mixed with His6-KinA383­606 in buffer C (50 mM NaPi, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol [pH 8]) containing 250 mM imidazole. After dilution with buffer A to give an imidazole concentration of 6 mM, the sample was incubated at 4 C for 1 hr. The resin was pel-

leted, then supernatant containing excess unbound KinA was removed. The concentration of His6-KinA383­606 was 3.1 nmol/40 l of resin assuming all KinA bound the resin. Mutant or wild-type Sda (0.7­2.8 nmol/3.1 nmol KinA) was added to resin, and the volume was made up to 80­90 l with buffer A. The resin mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 1 hr with rocking, then the supernatant, containing unbound proteins, was decanted, and beads were washed twice with buffer A. Thirty-two microliters of buffer A containing 625 mM imidazole was added to each tube, and then the resultant supernatant, containing proteins that had bound to beads, was decanted. Pull-downs with other His6-KinA constructs were performed similarly. Bound and unbound samples were analyzed using Tricine SDS-PAGE. Autophosphorylation Assays Autophosphorylation assays were performed essentially as described (Zapf et al., 1998). Reaction mixtures were assembled on ice, and reactions were started by adding ATP (0.5 mM final concentration, 25 Ci -32P-ATP/reaction) and shifting the temperature to 25 C. Each reaction contained 10 pmol of KinA1­606-His6 and 0­100 pmol of Sda. Reactions were stopped after 5 min by adding EDTA (pH 8) to 100 mM and placing samples on ice. Samples were electrophoresed on 10% glycine SDS-PAGE gels; then gels were washed before being exposed for 12 hr on a Phosphorimager plate (Molecular Dynamics). Dephosphorylation and Phosphotransfer Assays P-labeled KinA1­606-His6 P was prepared by incubating KinA1­606His6 (6.5 g, 95 pmol) in a 50 l reaction containing 0.5 mM ATP/ 50 Ci -32P-ATP. KinA1­606-His6 P was purified from the quenched reaction mix by gel filtration at 4 C using a BioSpin-30 column (BioRad) prerinsed with 50 mM NaPi (pH 8), 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA. Assays of KinA1­606-His6 P dephosphorylation and KinA1­606-His6 P-dependent phosphorylation of Spo0F-His6 were performed in 25 l reactions containing kinase buffer. KinA1­606His6 P ( 0.6 g, 9 pmol/reaction) was premixed on ice with Sda (500 ng, 90 pmol) or storage buffer. Reactions were started by adding kinase buffer alone or containing 1 mM ADP (final concentration) or 2.1 g Spo0F-His6 (150 pmol). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 C and stopped by adding EDTA to 100 mM. To monitor formation of 32P-ATP, 1 l of each reaction was spotted onto PEIcellulose and developed in 0.8 M acetic acid/0.8 M LiCl. To monitor formation of Spo0F-His6 P, samples were processed for SDSPAGE and exposed on a Phosphorimager plate as described for autophosphorylation assays.

MALLS MALLS was performed as described (Folta-Stogniew and Williams, 1999) using a miniDAWN Tristar laser light scattering photometer and Optilab DSP interferometric refractometer (both from Wyatt Technology). SEC was performed with buffer B using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech). All samples were injected in a final volume of 200 l to avoid volume-related retention-time artifacts. MW estimates were determined using Debye fitting, and reported errors are standard deviations (SDs) of the MW estimate. Structure Determination NMR data were acquired at 298 K on Varian INOVA 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers using 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled Sda ( 1 mM in buffer A [pH 6.85]). Data were processed with nmrPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995), and spectra were analyzed using XEASY (Bartels et al., 1995). 1 H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments were obtained as described (King et al., 1999). Crosspeak intensities in 13C- and 15 N-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra ( m 150 ms) were converted to distance restraints using DYANA (Guntert et al., 1997). Thirty-four ¨ (, ) restraints were derived using TALOS (Cornilescu et al., 1999), and errors were set to twice the estimated SD.  restraints were verified by 3JHNH couplings measured from a 3D HNHA spectrum. Four additional  restraints of 100 80 were obtained from H -HN NOEs (Clubb et al., 1994). Twenty-three 1 restraints and stereospecific assignments for nine pairs of -methylene protons were derived from NOESY intensities and 3JHNH couplings.

Sda was unstable when lyophilized. Thus, slowly exchanging amide protons were identified as those present in a 13C-edited NOESYHSQC spectrum acquired immediately after exchange of the sample into 2H2O using a 3K Centricon. Fifteen slowly exchanging amide protons were unambiguously assigned as H bond acceptors, and corresponding H-bond restraints were applied as described (King et al., 2000). DYANA was used to calculate 500 structures from random starting conformations. The best 50 structures (selected on the basis of final penalty function values) were refined in X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). ¨ 1 HN-15N residual dipolar couplings elicited by aligning Sda ( 200 M) using 10 mg/ml Pf1 filamentous phage (Asla Biotech) were used to ensure that the helices in the calculated structures had the correct relative orientation. MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996) was used for molecular graphics. Acknowledgments This work was supported by GM41934 from the NIH.
